REVISION IS
ATTENDED BY
DIFFICULTIES
General Zurlinden Sacrificed
Himself in Advocating
a New Trial,
Premier Brisson Secured Action Favor
able to Dreyfus Only After a
Long Struggle in the Cab
inet Council.
PARIS, Sept. 18.â The difficulties at
tendant upon securing a revision of the
Dreyfus proceedings may be gauged
from' the story now published that Gen
eral Zurlinden practically sacrificed
himself by advocating a revision of the
Drefyus case and that his change of
opinion is due to the strong feeling
which he afterward found among his
subordinates at the War Office.
According to newspaper accounts,
which are undoubtedly fairly correct,
Premier Bisson only got his way at
Saturday's Cabinet council, though
supported by eight of his colleagues,
after a tough fight against Qeneral
Zurlinden and M. Tillaye, the Minister
of Public Works, who were warmly
supported for three hours by President
Faure himself.
At the opening of the council, M.
Sarrien, Minister of Justice, stated his
views of the case at considerable
length, expressing his conviction that
a revision was necessary for the peace
of the country and expedient on the
ground that many of the documents in
the dossier appeared to be of doubt
ful authenticity, and above all, that
Colonel Henry's admission of forgery
threw suspicion upon all his evidence.
M. Sarrien, however, did not ask the
council to decide for or against re
vision, but only asked permission to
submit the matter to a commission, i
M. Faure opened the discussion. He
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1898.
I did not openly oppose a revision, but
j pointed out political and other objec
tions to the reopening of the case.
It is said that M. Brisson went so far
as to remind M. Faure of the constitu
tional limits to his function.
General Zurlinden admitted when he
took office that if he was not a Drey
fusite he at least had an open mind
and felt great sympathy for the Drey
fus family. A deep study of the dos
sier, however, had absolutely con
vinced him that Dreyfus was guilty.
Finally a division occurred in which
M. Faure did not take part. A semi
official note explains that General Cha
noine only had a conference with Presi
dent Faure after his appointment to
succeed General Zurlinden had actu
ally been signed. The decision of the
committee appointed to consider the
matter of revision will be no way bind
ing upon the Cabinet, which still will
have to decide the actual question of
revision.
It is reported, however, that a vessel
has already started for the Isle dv
Diable in readiness to bring Dreyfus
to Paris, and M. Brisson and General
Charioine are determined that nobody,
however high his position, will be shel
tered. Stirring events are regarded as
pending. General Zurlinden is credited
with the belief that there is a Picquart
mystery and it is believed that he fully
intended Picquurt should be prosecuted.
According to Colonel Picquarfs writ
ten statement to the Minister of Jus
tice, four secret documents were sub
mitted to the court-martial held in 1894,
behind the backs of Dreyfus and his
counsel.
It is reported that the Government
has selected Beabois, capital of the De
partment of Oise, as the most suitable
town in which to hold a rehearing of
the case.
Lie Soir says General Chanoine, the
newly appointed War Minister, told
friends that he regarded himself as a
sentinel, relieving another charged with
watching over the army's rights, and
intimated that he was appointed by the
Cabinet and he was not responsible in
the decisions of the council. He de
clared that should he see any attempt
or pretext a revision of the Dreyfus
proceedings to engage in maneuvers
against the army, he would immediate
ly resign.
The majority of Paris papers approve
of the Cabinet's decision, which is
looked upon as the first definite step
taken toward revision.
A few unimportant street demonstra
tions occurred last night.

GERMANY YET
SCHEMING IN
PHILIPPINES
Evidently Clings io the Hope
of Sharing in Their
Disposition.
Doings of an Engineer in Investi
gating the Coal Deposits of
Cebu Reported to the Peace
Commission,
0 NEW YORK, Sept. 18.â The 0
0 Washington correspondent of 0
0 the Herald sends the following: 0
0 As an indication that Germany 0
0 has been scheming to share In 0
0 the disposition of the Philip- 0
0 pines, the authorities have 0
0 learned that, acting under In- 0
& structlons from Berlin, the Ger- 0
0 man commander-in-chief of the 0
0 Asiatic squadron has made $n 0
8 exhaustive Investigation of the 0
0 coal deposits of the islands. He 0
0 ' was assisted by a German engi- 0
0 neer, who had been temporarily 0
0 assigned to his squadron for the 0
0 especial purpose of locating 0
0 coal. The engineer conducted a 0
0 thorough Investigation, and his 0
0 report, which has been submit- 0
0 ted to the German Govern- 0
0 ment through Vice Admiral 0
0 Diedrlch, shows that the best 0
0 lignite deposits are located on 0
0 the island of Cebu, one of the 0
0 Viscaya group. 0
This information has been received
from one of the representatives of this
Government In Germany, and has been
considered of sufficient importance to
be presented to the Peace Commisslon-
erÃ for their consideration. Officials
with whom I talked to-day regarding
the matter admit that there can be
only one object which would lead the,
Berlin Government to direct such an
Investigationâ a desire to extend Ger
man jurisdiction over the island which
has the largest beds of coal best
adapted for steaming purposes.
Such an island is Cebu, and reports
which have been received show that
lignite of good quality is found there in
large quantities. Germany would find
Cebu exceedingly valuable as a coaling
station, as it would not necessitate the
establishment of a coal pile at Kiao
Chou, which she recently obtained.
Aware of Germany's proceedings, the
authorities are taking precautions to
prevent the consummation of any plan
which will enable them to reach frui
tion. The Berlin Government, by the
reduction of its fleet in Manila Bay,
gave an indication of its desire to re
main on friendly terms with this Gov
ernment. While regretting the main
tenance of such a large force at Manila,
no protest was made by this Govern
ment, and the action of Germany in re
ducing its naval force was entirely
voluntary. The report made by the
German engineer explains to the offi
cials why the German vessels were
steaming among the islands.
President McKinley does not propose
to permit Germany to acquire any of
the Philippines or permit Spain to dis
pose of an inch of territory in the far
East. Under the instructions which
have been given to the American Com
missioners, they will demand of the
Spanish representatives reversionary
rights in the islands for the United
States, and an agreement will be
reached which will give this Govern
ment a voice in the disposition and
government of the islands in the future.
The battleships Oregon and lowa will
start for Manila via Cape Horn and
Honolulu next Saturday or Sunday.
NO SQUADRON FOR
REAR ADMIRAL SCHLEY
Santiago Hero Will Return to His
Position on the Lighthouse
Board.
NEW YORK, Sept. 18.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Considerable
speculation is being engaged in by naval
officers as to the duty which will be given
Rear Admiral W. S. Schley wnen he com
pletes his work in connection with the
Porto Rican military commission. It is
rather expected that he will return to fill
the position of chairman of the Lighthouse
Board, the office he held before his as
signment to the command of the flying
squadron. In view of the intention of
Secretary Long to re establish European
and South Atlantic squadrons, it was
thought that Commodore Schley might
stand a chance of being assigned perhaps
to the former, but it Is believed that he
will be given the important duty of the
head of the Lighthouse Board.

DEMOCRATIC
SLATE READY
FOR THE GANG
The Municipal Ticket Prepared
in Advance of the
Convention-
Methods of Phelan and His Colleagues That
Would Put to Shame Buckley's
Coarsest Work.
Compared to that so-called Demo
cratic County Committee of One Hun
dred, the See Yup Tong seems to be
composed of high principled gentlemen.
When Christopher A. Buckley studies
the methods of procedure of that gang
of political highbinders led by the
Gallaghers, the McNabs, the Sullivans
and the Maguires, he can look back to
his own days of dictatorship with feel
ings of fervent gratitude that he never
in all his career dragged his party to
such depths of degradation as have his
illegitimate successors.
Christopher A. Buckley was at least
true to his friends; these fellows are
not even true to themselves. Buckley
always made a pretense at least of ob
serving the fundamental principles of
Democracy. The Gallagher-McNabs
do not seem to be able to give the true
definition of Democracy, or being able,
ignore its precepts on every possible
and impossible occasion. Buckley was
astute enough to give a coloring of i ng
ularity of all his proceedings. Ihe
Committee of One Hundred is so blinded
by its temporary power that it seems
to glory in its irregularities. The
"Blind Btfss of Bush street" ever sought
to cultivate friends and harmonize con
lending factions. The political out
laws now in control care naught for
friends pr foes while harmony is not
of their reckoning. Above all, Buckley
ne\er posed as anything but what he
â¢\vj_s, a shrewd, far-reaching political
jobber. These men, without one of
Buckley's redeeming qualities, assume
an "I am holier than thou" air on every
possible occasion, and prate of their
own virtues even as they concoct the
vilest political schemes, all the while
berating their betters as being too dis
honest to trust with any share in their
government beyond the pitiful privi
lege of voting the Phelans, the Gal
laghers and the rest of that ilk into of
fice.
It was thought the climax was
reached last Friday night, when, by
methods that would have shamed the
moat outrageous proceeding Buckley
ever engineered, the Committee of One
Hundred resolved itself into a muni
cipal convention to meet to-night for
the purpose of nominating certain of
its members to office. Its very action
was an admission that its plan of ac
tion was solely to advance the political
ambition of certain people who could
never hope for recognition at the hands
of a representative body of Democrats.
But though certain members protested
against the proceeding as illegal and in
conflict with every principle of Democ
racy, those members were included in
the adopted list of delegates to the con
vention, and thus virtually assured
that they would be given a voice in the
choosing of its nominees.
Moreover, in accordance with a res
olution adopted declaring that no can
didate for office in the gift of the con
vention should be a delegate, R. P.
Doolan, A. B. Maguire, James Denman,
John H. Grady, T. J. Pinder, Franklin
K. Lane, M. Greenblatt and Finlay Cook
handed in their resignations, thereby
anonuncing themselves as candidate*.
It was only natural that they should
expect their old associates to deal fair
ly by them and listen to their claims
for recognition on the floor of the con
vention before committing themselves
to any candidates.
But these political outcasts have
turned down their own friends â or
some of them â in other words, have
proved the falsity, of the old adage
about there being "honor among
thieves," and within forty-eight hours
after electing themselves delegates to
the Democratic municipal convention
and twenty-four hours before the date
agreed upon for the first meeting of
that convention they have agreed upon
a complete ticket. Not only have they
agreed upon it, but they have bandied
the names of their chosen ones about
to such an extent that The Call is en
abled this morning to present to the
public the Democratic municipal ticket
the convention will go through the
farce of nominating this week. As a
matter of fact, the convention will
merely be a ratification of tfne nomina
tions already made.
Here is the ticket:
Mayor â James D. Phelan.
Auditor â John H. Grady.
Treasurer â M. Greenblatt.
Sheriff â Theodore F. Bon
net.
Assessor â A. J. Clunie.

manded that he be allowed to name the
Democratic candidates for Supervisors.
His demand was acceeded to, and it is
a fact that the seven Democratic mem
bers of the "Solid Eight" of the present
board were placed on the ticket at the
behest of Mr. Phelan. That gentleman
has made the same demand again this
year, and, as before, it has been grant
ed. But Mayor Phelan has not yet
given his instructions to the Commit
tee of One Hundred, therefore The Call
is unable to present the names of the
candidates for Supervisors this morn
ing. But Mr. Phelan will complete his
selections, with the aid of that other
reformer, Deacon George K. Fitch,
with whom Phelan is in close commu
nion at all times, In ample season for
the Committee of One Hundred â Demo
cratic convention â ratification meeting
to place them on the ticket, and The
Call will give their names in due time.
There is the ticket complete, with the
exception of Supervisors and School Di
rectors, hich Democrats will do well
to ponder over. Substitutions have
been made that will necessitate much
explanation before voters will accept
them. Democrats have been shelved
whom all parties would delight to
honor, while in some instances no
bodies, or at best men of uncertain
reputations, have been brought to the
front.
The surprise of the slate will be found
in the fact that James L*. Gallagher is
not down for City and County Attor
ney. Gallagher could have had the
nomination had he wanted it, but for
the first time in history a Gallagher
has refused an office. Not that Galla
gher is going to return to private life.
Oh, no. He has merely concluded to
wait, and if Maguire is elected take
some appointive office under the Gov
ernor. He regards Maguire's election
as certain as his own would be, and in
accepting an appointive office he will
save the expense of making a personal
campaign. Shrewd are the Gallaghers.
Mayor Phelan is slated for re-election
of necessity. That is what all this un-
savory work has been consummated for,
and that is what took him to San Jose
during the Native Sons' celebration
and impelled him to order that lone
cork drawn at the Vendome, said cork
being eagerly sought by everybody
present as a souvenir.
Honest, sturdy William Broderick,
who has stood a veritable bulwark be
tween treasury and the boodlers, is al
lowed to go and John H. Grady is to
have the nomination for Auditor in his
stead.
So, too, must Christian Reis step
aside from Mr. Greenblatt, the editor of
the German Demokrat. Mr. Greenblatt
Is a worthy citizen, but he is a no
vitiate in public office, while Christian
Reis has been tried for many years
and has gained the entire confidence of
everybody.
James N. Block will be renominated
for Tax Collector, while Andrew J.
Clunie is to be placed in charge of tha
Assessor's office if the people will have
it. There has been some talk of chang
ing Block and Clunie about, but they
will be given the offices they are slated
for.
For County Clerk, John A. Brown, a
salesman in J. J. O'Brien & Co.'s dry
goods house, is on the card. Mr. Brown
may be an execllent salesman; un
doubtedly he is, or he would not hold
a position in that estimable house, but
certainly his ambition is soaring when
he aspires to the County Clerkship on
his very first venture into the political
arena. â¢
Another big surprise will be in the
dismissal of Sheriff Richard I. Whelan
and the probable selection of License
Collector Bonnet for that position.
Whelan's Democratic friends are with
out number and his administration of
the office during the past two years has
been such from a Democratic stand
point as to lead him to believe he was
entitled to a renomination. But Whe
lan is cast aside and Bonnet can have
the office on certain conditions. There
is no other candidate if Bonnet
will consent to let the Committee of One
Hundred dip into the office. Bonnet has
not yet consented, and his confirmation
hangs fire in consequence.
R. P. Doolan is one of the Committee
of One Hundred who will reap his re
ward in the Superintendent of Streets
office, provided Tim Treacy does not
want the place. Treacy stands first,
with Doolan second, but Tim is in
about the same position as Jim Gal
lagher and is studying as to whether
it is better to take an appointment
under Maguire than to risk his own
money on a local fisht. Treacy is one
of Maguire's State Central Committee
men and can have almost anything the
little Pinto Giant can give away.
Eugene N. Deuprey gets the District
Attorney nomination. John Barrett
thought at one time that he had a
show for the place, but John is in the
discard now.
Ex-Assemblyman Pinder has been
turned down for Recorder, and that
office is open to engagement. Pinder
was on the slate all right, but he was
discovered to be one of the Three Tail
ors of Tooley street, and now he is no
longer a reformer.
Another unknown in the person of
Dr. Francis Emerson is dragged forth
for the office of Coroner, while James
B. Denman has a cinch on the nomina
tion for School Superintendent.
There will be another secret meeting
of the Committee of One Hundred this
morning at which selections for Re
corder and Surve: - or will be made.
All this may be meekly accepted by
the Democrats, but to those who do not
train with that crowd the action of the
Committee of One Hundred in slatinsj
a ticket â and such a ticket â so bare
facedly looks like taking a shy at Prov
idence.
C. A. Buckley has some knowledge of
slates, but this work of the purifiers
will make him want to take a couvae
JLu the kindergarten oX politics.2

Two ships of the Campania Transat
lantica are expected to arrive here on the

been found. In good faith the Spanish
Commissioners have met the Americans
and arranged with them terms of evacu

HAVANA, Sept. 18.â At the Tacon The

play based upon the Dreyfus trial In
which Dreyfus was portrayed through

sympathy of the audience for Dreyfus
was manifested. Four Frenchmen, one
of whom is supposed to have been an
officer of the French gunboat Fulton, j
now lying in the harbor, occupied a box |
In tho first tier. All of them carried
boatswain's whistles and at every Insinu

they began to blow their whistles and
hiss the players. A scene of indescribable
tumult followed, the entire audience-ris
ing In defense of Dreyfus. The French
men were forcibly ejected and the per
formance was continued without further
interruption.
One of the Frenchmen, who was
thouffht to be an officer or the Fulton,
refused to give his name at the station
house, to which the party wae taken after
beinpr ejected from the theater, and was
locked up over night.
General Blanco has prohibited tho fu

GATHER TO CUT
THE FUSION PIE
Three Conventions at
Santa Monica.
ALL TO OPEN ON TUESDAY
FACTIONS MAY QUARREL OVER
THE DIVISION.
Movement on Foot to Place Senator
White In the Senatorial Race,
Despite His Intention
to Retire.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 18.â The Dem
ocratic, Populist and Silver Republican
County Conventions will be convened
at Santa Monica simultaneously on
Tuesday for ft naming of a fusion
county ticket. The pie has not yet
been divided among the three political
divisions, and it is certain that some
difficulty will be experienced in reach
ing a satisfactory apportionment.
The fight now is being waged as to
which party shall have the nomination
for District Attorney. The Silver Re
publicans wish it for their State chair
man, J. Noonan Phillips. The Demo
crats do not want Phillips, and in or
der to defeat him are willing that the
Populists shall name the nominee for
that office. There are two factions in
the Democratic party â the "silk stock
ing" element and the "push." It looks
as though the "push" would run the
convention.
A movement is on foot to have reso
lutions adopted which will place Ste
phen M. White In the Senatorial con
test whether he wants to be or not. The
resolution will review Senator White's
services to his constituents and will
advise the people of Southern Califor
nia to elect members of the Legislature
favorable to White. Then the state
ment will be made that if White were
given a re-election to the Senate he

NO FUSION IN LAKE.
Populists Will Support the Republi-
can Ticket.
LAKEPORT, Sept. 18.â Politics in Lake
County Is now at red heat. The Re
publicans named a ticket two weeks ago.
The Democrats and Populists both met
here with the intention of fusing, but the
scheme was a failure. The Democrats
then nominated a full county ticket, the
Populists adjourning until to-day. They
were much put out because the Demo
crats would not fuse with them. The
Populists did not put up a full ticket.
They nominated only three men on the
county ticket and the district officers.
Most of the Populists will support tho
Republican ticket.
SIMS SAYS DREYFUS
ESCAPED LONG AGO
NEW YORK, Sept. 19.â The World
prints the following under a London
date: George R. Sims, playwright and
journalist, has long maintained that
Dreyfus was rescued from Devil's Is
land two years ago through the instru
mentality of a French syndicate or
ganized to secure the liberation of pris
oners in penal settlements who can
pay heavily for their freedom. Sims
now says:
"The real difficulty the French Gov
ernment is in with regard to Dreyfus is
to find him. When he was rescued
from Devil's Island two years ago and
a substitute was left in his place, the
Government officials, terriefied at the
outcriy which would be raised in
France, accepted the substitute.
"Dreyfus himself went to South
America, where he is living under an
assumed name. His wife dares not
quit France to join him; that would
mean a plot for his arrest or assassi
nation. Dreyfus does not yet feel suf
ficient confidence In the authorities and
the French people to put his head In
the lion's den. If Dreyfus ever re
turns to take a new trial you may be
sure his acquittal will have been abso
lutely assured beforehand."
ESTERHAZY SAYS HE
WILL CONFESS ALL
NEW YORK, Sept. 18.â A ' London
cablegram to the World says: Major
Esterhazy is about to make a full con
fession of his connection with the plot
to disgrace Dreyfus. As he admits
that he cannot return to Prance, it is
evident that the part he took involves
criminal consequences. In an author
ized statement he says:
"There is no longer any justice for
me in my own country, and the time
has arrived to make a full disclosure
of the part I played In the Dreyfus af
fair. . 1 intend to make this disclosure
in the interest of truth, regardless of
itÃ result to Dreyfus personally,
"I can no longer allow myself to be
made a scapegoat. The responsibility
must be fairly distributed.
"You want to know whether my dis
closures will, clear Dreyfus. I answer
that out of a thousand documents mak
ing up the Dreyfus dossier, I kno.w that
six hundred are forged. 1 am prepared
to show by whom and under what cir
cumstances these forgeries were com-
mitted. '
"Whether Dreyfus be innocent, as his
champions suppose, remains tojje seen.
That can be safely left to the public to
Judge when they are In possession of
all the facts."
WAS DREYFUS THE
VICTIM OF THE ARMY?
LONDON, Sept. 19.â David Christie
Murray publishes in the Morning to-
day a long story regarding the Dreyfus
affair. The author vouches for the
truth of the story, but declares that
he cannot disclose the source from
which he obtained his information.
The article states in effect that Drey
fus was engaged as a spy in the em
ploy of a secret department of the
French army against those suspected
of trafficlng with Germany and other
powers. His zeal, so the story goes,
led him to become the victim of re
venge on the part of Colonel Henry,
Comte Esterhazy and Colonel Paty dv
Clam, 'who themselves were concerned
In treasonable practices.

NAVAL RESERVES
TO COME UNDER
NATIONAL CONTROL
Signal Corps Probably Will Be In
eluded Among Their Several
Organizations.
NEW YORK, Sept. 18.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: If the recommendation of Captain J. H. Bartlett, re
tired, chief of the naval auxiliary fleet and superintendent of the
coast signal system, are adopted, the naval militia of the country will
be under national control and will include a signal corps among its
organizations.
Captain Bartlett is now preparing reports and .will submit them
to the Secretary within the next ten days. I understand that he be
lieves that the militia should be trained as it has been in the past, ex
cept that it should have better facilities and opportunities to serve on
modern men of war instead of antiquated vessels. As the coast
signal system was operated to a great extent by men trained by naval
militia officers, he will urge the formation of a corps comprising sig
nal men and telegraphers, who shall be available in connection with
the coast signal system in time of emergency, the whole to be su
pervised by a chief, whose quarters should be located in Washington.
Secretary Long is deeply impressed with the advantages of the
two services and his report will have a great deal to say regarding
their value, and what should be done to Improve them.
MISS PERKINS IS
NOT CONCERNED
Regards Her Notoriety
as a Joke.
MILL POND MYSTERY GROWS
DISMEMBERED BODY NOT YET
IDENTIFIED.
Two Young Ladies Whom It Ap
peared to Resemble Are Still
in the Land of the
Living.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MIDDLEBORO, Mass., Sept. 18.âAf
ter telegraphing and telephoning, a
member of the Bridgeport police gained
possession of the woman's dismemb
ered body found in Yellow Millpond,
and brought here by Frank W. Perkins,
who had mistaken it for that of his
daughter Grace. The town was scarce
ly awake this morning when Detective
George Arnold of the Bridgewater po
lice arrived. The first -thing he did
was to call on Undertaker Williams,
who brought the remains of the un
known woman from Taunton last
night, and requested that they be de
livered to him. Mr. Williams informed
the detective that he intended to hold
them until he received definite orders
from the Coroner at Bridgeport to give
them up, supplemented by a sworn
statement from Mr. Perkins that the
fragments of the body in the box were
not those of his daughter.
At noon a telegram was received from
the Coroner, addressed to Undertaker
Williams and containing an order to
give up the body to Arnold.
Mr. Perkins was induced to sign the
statement demanded by the under
taker. With the two documents Arn
old again presented himself at the un
dertaker's and obtained the body, which
was in an advanced state of decompo
sition.
Miss Perkins appears very much un
concerned regarding the whole affair
and looks on it as more of a joke than
anything else. She kept Indoors to
day, and although the house was *wÂ«ll
surrounded by curious people, few
caught even a glimpse of her.
The Bournes are even closer mouthed
than the Perkins family, although
denying emphatically that the two arÂ«
married. The family have intimated
that at the proper time a statement
will be made aa to Charles Bourne and
Miss PeTkins.
WILKESBARRE, Pa.. Sept. 18.â Mrs.
John R. Thomas of Warrior Union, this
county, received a dispatch from the
Chief of Police at Stamford, Conn., that
her daughter Grace was alive and well
in that city. This was a great relief
to Mrs. Thomas, who had been led to
believe from the description of the
press that the woman found murdered
In a pond In Bridgeport was her
daughter.

AN ELOQUENT RECOGNITION
CBEATES THE ORDER OF ST.
ELIZABETH.
To Be Conferred Upon Women and
Girls Meriting Distinction in
the Various Avocations
of Life.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VIENNA, Sept 18.â A rescript of the
Emperor to Count yon Thunn Hohen
stein, president of the Austrian Coun
cil of Ministers, was published to-day,
expressing, in eloquent and pathetic
language, the Emperor's thanks for the
expressions of natiorial sympathy with
him in his great bereavement. In the
course of the rescript, his Majesty
says :
"The murdering hand, the instrument
of frenzied fanaticism, aiming at the
destruction of existing social order,
which was raised against the noblest
of women in blind and purposeless
hate, struck a heart which knew not
hate and beat only for good. Amid the
grief by which I and my house are
etricken and in the presence of the un
heard-of deed which has sent a shud
der through the whole civilized world,
the voice of my beloved people first
brings balm to my heart in affecting
unieon with the resound of universal
lamentation for our immeasurable loss,
like a faithful echo of all that moves
my own soul. From my deeply sorrow
ing heart, I thank all for this new
pledge of devoted sympathy. If the
festive peals which should have greet
ed this year should remain dumb
there yet remains to me the memory
of innumerable proofs of loyalty and
deep sympathy, the most precious gift
which could have been bestowed upon
me. Our common grief weaves a new
and intimate bond between the throne
and the fatherland."
Another imperial rescript founds a
new- order, and medals of St. Eliza
beth, in memory of the deceased, will
be conferred upon women and irlrls
meriting distinction in the various
avocations of life or in special religous
numantarian and philantnropic work'
The Emperor is invested with the
SO if tt ight of conferring the order
which comprises three degrees, with a
grand cross for the first and second
classes, bearing an enameled picture of
St. P:iizabeth of Thuringia.
T* 1 * first recipient of the order was
the Countess Szarpay, who has received
an autograph letter from the Emperor
conferring upon her the grand cross or
the order in recognition of her devoted
services to the dead Empress In her
last moments.

OUTLINING PLANS
FOR OCCUPATION
Disposition of Regulars
and Volunteers.
SUBJECT OF A CONFERENCE
SEVENTH AEMY CORPS WILL
BE UNBROKEN.
Probable Assignment of Troops to
Cuba, Porto Rico and the
Philippines Until Con
gress Meets.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 18.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: It is
not now expected that any more regu
lar troops will be assigned to stations
west of the Mississippi. Regulars now
east of the Mississippi will be ordered
to Alabama, Georgia and South Caro
lina, where they will be camped with
the volunteers.
This was the plan outlined to me this
afternoon by Acting Secretary of War
Meiklejohn. It is the result of a con
ference held yesterday between Presi
dent McKlnley, Secretary Meiklejohn
and General fc-Jes.
Secretary Melklejohn said the pur
pose now was for all the regiments in
the East to gro to Porto Rico and Cuba.
It Is not proposed to send more than a
few, if any, regulars to Porto Rico, but
the volunteer army to go to Cuba will
be well seasoned with them. There
will, according to the present plan, be
certainly not less than 10,000 regulars
sent to Cuba. The whole Cuban army
of occupation, however, will consist of
from 50,000 to 60,000 men. The regular*
will remain there at least from sixty to
ninety days. The programme has pro
gressed no further.
Secretary Meiklejohn said that this
was absolutely the only subject dis
cussed at the conference. The volun
teer regiments to be designated have
not yet been touched upon, yet it is
well understood that the Seventh Army
Corps will go practically without being
broken. The men are believed to be in
good physical trim and well disciplined,
and the administration is especially
gratified at the fine condition to which
General Lee has brought them.
General Miles says that the 12,000
men now in Porto Rico will be suffi
cient, and 20,000 men are the most that
Is reckoned upon for Manila. The three
additional regiments ordered in readi
ness several days ago for Honolulu will
not be soon added to.
Troops will be kept in Cuba until a
stable form of government is estab
lished. The island will be under mili
tary government until Congress assem
bles and adjusts whatever changes in
conditions there may be thought wise.
The basis on which the armies of oc
cupation will remain in Porto Rico and
Manila Is different from that of Cuba
and will be treated, therefore, from a
different view pointy
ODD FELLOWS TAKING
POSSESSION OF BOSTON
Spend a Day in Sight-Seeing Before

BOSTON, Sept. 18.â With the coming of
the morrow, the Odd Fellows of the Unit
ed States will own this city. They have
come as the representatives to the Sov
ereign Grand Lodge and incidentally to
enjoy a week of pleasure under the direc
tion of the Grand Lodge of Massa
chusetts. Practically all the Grand
Lodge representatives are preparing for
the opening sessions. To-day the visitors
spent the time chiefly in sight-seeing, al
though the Sovereign Lodge attended
divine service at the Church of the Dis
ciples, where Rev. Dr. Everett Hale
preached, and delegations attended sev
eral other churches, where the services
had a bearing on the events of the com
ing week.
To-morrow the first session of the high
bodies of the order will be held with pub
lic exercises. Then the Sovereign Grand
Lodge will meet and transact routine
business leading up to the election of
officers, which will be followed by a ban
quet. The Rebekahs will also figure in
the early ceremonies. While a programme
has been arranged for each day, that of
Wednesday Is the chief figure. The pa
rade will be held then and 15,000 are ex
pected to be In line.
FREE LUMBER FOR ALL.
Large Quantities Thrown Up on the
Beach Near Monterey.
SALINAS, Sept. 18.â Visitors to Mosa
Landing- report a large quantity of lumber
of all sizes thrown up on the coast be
tween that place and Monterey during
the past ten days. The wood, which ap
parently was cut recently from trees,
ranges in size from that of a poet stake
to large pieces aggregating twenty-eight
and thirty feet. All the pieces are square.
Already over fifty truckloads have passed
through Castroville, having been saved by
the residents. It is estimated that over
100,000 feet was secured to yesterday by
the wreckers. The quantity still on the
beach is vast and cannot be estimated.
Where the drift has come from is un
known, as no wrecks are known to have
occurred near that vicinity. It seems to
have come from a northerly direction.
The wood has not been in the water long.
It is thought it might have come from
one of the rafts being towed down from
Puget Sound, and which broke to pieces
at sea.

All Will Be Sent to Philadelphia and
Harrisburg for Treatment as
Rapidly as They Can Be
Transported.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CAMP MEADE, MIDDLETOWN,
Pa., Sept. 18.â i^fteen typhoid fever
cases were shipped from the Second
Division Hospital this evening to the
Charity Hospital, Norristown, in a spe
cal car. The patients were from the
Two Hundred and First and Two Hun
dred and Second New York, Fourth
Missouri, First Rhode Island and Sec
ond West Virginia regiments. Chief
Surgeon Oirard believes the sick will
do better In hospitals than in tents, and
has arranged to ship more away to
morrow to Harrisburg and Philadelphia
hospitals. There are 175 fever patients
in the hospitals and they will be taken
as rapidly as they can be moved.
Private Biston D. Danto, Company
X, Third New York, died In the Red
Cross Hospital to-day of typhoid fever
and his body was shipped to Wells
ville. Corporal Samuel Crager, Com
pany H, Second Tennessee, died of con
gestive chills at the regimental dispen
sary, after a brief illness.
Detailed reports have been received
by Colonel Girard from the various
regimental surgeons on the health of
their regiments. They report but very
few malarial cases, and in the regi
ments where this malady has been
greatest it is on the decrease. Most of
the cases of typhoid fever and malaria
have been brought here from the camps
in the South and Camp Black, N. Y.
Colonel Abbott of the First Rhode Isl
and is seriously ill with typhoid fever
at the home of a friend in Middletown.
The Fifteenth Michigan has moved
on the grounds vacated by the Twelfth
Pennsylvania, which starts to-morrow
afternoon for Its home State for muster
out. The Michigan regiment takes the
place of the Twelfth in General Cor
bin's brigade of the First Division.
Chief Quartermaster Howard says the
Seventh Ohio, which has received or
ders to muster out, will hardly get
away before Thursday. This will com
plete, for a while at least, the move
ment of troops from camp. There is
a strong probability that the Four
teenth Pennsylvania will be the next
regiment to receive orders to muster
out on account of the trouble among
the officers.
The following medic/ officers have
been detailed as brigv^le surgeons:
First Divisionâ First Brigade, D. A.
Rannells, Seventh Ohio; Second Brig
ade, A. M. Johnston, Fourteenth Penn
sylvania; Third Brigade, C. E. Kauss,
Eighth Pennsylvania. Second Division
âFirst Brigade, Burton S. Booth, Two
tiundred and Third New York; Second
Brigade, H. D. Kteebler, Fourth Mis
souri; Third Brigade, Lester S. Hunt,
First Rhode Island.
The camp has become scattered so
that the scores of army teams have
been forced to work eighteen hours a
day. The long hours are telling on the
health of the teamsters and Colonel
Howard has asked the War Depart
ment for seventy-flve additional teams.
He was advised to-day that fifteen
four-mule and ten two-horse teams
would be immediately forwarded. The
water system is being run into the
camp of the First Delaware and other
outlying regiments. General Graham
will wait until all the regiments have
been supplied before extending the sys
tem to corps headquarters.

SUFFERING OVER
Death Claims the Daughter of tY)e
Late PresideQt of the Soutb
ern Confederacy.
XARRAGANSETT PIER. R. L, Sept.
18.â Miss Winnie Davis, daughter of
Mrs. Jefferson Davis, died at noon to
day at the Rockingham Hotel, to which
place she came as a guest in the early i
part of the Pier's social season. She
had been ill for several weeks and a
fortnight ago her ailment was diag
nosed as malarial gastritis. At times
her condition became very serious, so
that consTiltations of physicians were \
deemed necessary, but frequent rallies
gave renewed hope that she would ulti
mately recover. During the past week
especially was her condition considered
favorable and it was thought her re
moval from the hotel would be possible
In a few days, as the hotel had closed
for the season, leaving the patient and
attendants practically alone in the
house. Last night, however, a relapse
in Miss Davis' condition was noticed
aoid throughout the night she lost
strength perceptibly. This morning
tbe physicians said that the end was
not far off and at noon death came to
end the sufferings, which at times had
been intense. Mrs. Davis had watched
unremittingly at her daughter's bed-
Bide and she is now bowed with sor
row. The physicians of Mrs. Davis re
port she is holding up with great calm
ness in her affliction and no fears are
at present entertained of her health I
yielding to the strain.
Miss Winnie Davis, the "Daughter of
the Confederacy," was born in the
Confederate Executive Mansion at |
Richmond, Va.. in 1863. She was edu
cated principally at home owing to the
troubles surrounding her father and the i
publicity which attended all movements 'â 
of the Davis family. Miss Davis at
tained her maturity at Beauvolr, Miss.
Here she assisted her mother in various â¢â 
â ways and took her place in the many
social functions of the place. She v.-as
her father's constant companion. She j
assisted him in all his work and much I
of the information which was required
by Mr. Davis in his writings was se- I
cured for him by his daughter. Her j
strong character was marked from |

COXXA.NDEB, , t OF THE FAMOUS
CAPRON BATTERY.
Grief Over the Death of His Son, an
Officer of the Rough Riders,
Paved the Way for Fatal
â¢ Sickness.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 18.â Captain
Allyn Capron, First Artillery, died at
his home near Fort Myer, Va_, to-day.
Captain Capron was one of the best
known officers ;n the regular army. He
had devoted himself particularly to the
artillery branch of the service, having
been an honor graduate of the artillery
school In 1873, and was regarded as an
authority on artillery tactics.
When General Shatter's corps went
to Santiago Capron accompanied it,
and his battery did fine work In the
battle of Santiago. During the first
days of the fighting before the city,
Captain Capron'S son. Captain Allyn
K. Capron of the Rough Riders was
killed.
The death of his son preyed upon
the father's mind, but he never swerved
for an instant from his duty during the
terrible days that followed. The seeds
of disease were sown in his system
during the Cuban campaign, and he
returned to his home at Fort Myer,
near this city, only to be stricken down
with typhoid fever. His death oc
curred about 12 o'clock to-day.
Captain Capron was born in Florida
and entered the Military Academy as a
cadet in 1863. After graduating he was
made a second lieutenant of the First
Artillery on the 17th of June. 1867, and
was an officer of that regiment until
his death. He was commissioned as
captain on the 4th of December, 1888.
It Is probable that Captain Capron
will be buried in Arlington National
Cemetery, but no definite arrangements
for his funeral have yot been made.

MANY FIRES AT SACRAMENTO.
Growing Belief That an Incendiary
Is at Work in the City.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 18.â The loss by
the fire that burned the Booth building on
Front street this morning amounts to
about $15,000 on the building nnd fmm
$15,000 to $20,000 on the contents, owned
by the W. P. Fuller Company, which car
ried heavy insurance. Seven fine horses
stabled In the rear were burned.
About 4 o'clock, while the city's three
engines were being housed, a flre started
in a small structure on L street, between
Second and Third, atyl it was burned. At
"> o'clock fire broke out in a Juputietfe
licuso in the rear of SOS L Street. Rkla
Kadido was terribly burned and may die.
Hip wife and child barely escaped with

lic explanation of the rupture was

FOOD IN SIGHT
Awful State of Affairs
at Havana.
A SERIOUS CRISIS AT HAND
SUPPLIES BEFUSED A LANDING
BY OFFICIALS.
Insurgents Have Observed the Ar
mistice, but Are New Becom
ing Threatening â Story of
an American.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
HeraW. Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Cuba, Sept. IS.â A reply
on the Comal question is expected to
morrow or Tuesday. The answer can
not come too soon. It was the food
problem that caused bad feeling be
tween the United States and Spain be
fore the war. It is. the food problem
now that is bringing nearer and nearer
a serious crisis. The insurgent Cubans
have thus far observed the suspension
of hostilities, but the insurgents, armed
as they are still, cannot be left to
starve many days longer if peace is to
be preserved in the island. To the
pangs of hunger from which they are
suffering, aggravation is added by the
knowledge that the Comal, laden with
a cargo of supplies, is not allowed to
land them.
PUEBLO, Col., Sept. 18.â A letter hag
been received here from a well-known
Pueblo citizen, who has been In Ha
vana in an official capacity and was
one of the very few Americans admit
ted for special reasons to witness the
feeding of the poor at Havana soup
houses before they were closed byÃlan
co's orders last week. Tl. i letter was
sent in four pieces to elude attention in
the malls. Among other things It says:
"Large basins were placed about on
the floor, filled with a sort of soup
made of beans, rice and sometimes a
bit of meat cooked with it. This was
dipped Into smaller pans â one pan to a
family or group. Among the notes
taken I find that the allowance of meat
is eighty poum-s per week for 500 per
sons. For the very sick and the small
children a scant portion of condensed
milk Is given. Bread is never issued.
â¢'I counted eighteen on the upper
floor, more d d thaif alive, some of
them suffering intensely. A mother
with six children occupied two cots.
Three of the smaller children were
scarcely alive, our boys, 10 to 13 years
old, lay panting for life: three young
girls were so swollen about the body
and limbs that they could not move â
all these and many more were waiting
to die. Several elderly women were
among them. Altogether the sight was
frightful."
Of a small child the writer says:
"The face was skin over the little
bones. Such eyesâ oh, that picture!
The mother was in the same condition,
while tears ran down her face. We
turned and followed them. Later I
asked her some questions through the
interpreter. Her story lÂ» beyond con
ception â too cruel to be published and
sent into homes among children."
The writer describes the refusal of
Spanish authorities to permit the land
ing of tons of food sent to Havana by
the Red Cross for these poor people,
and the soup houses are now closed.
SHEEPMEN ARHESTED
BY UTAH CAVALRY
Yosemite Valley Herders Brought in
as Prisoners and Their
Flocks Scatter jd.
"WAWONA, Sept. 18.â People in this
section are realizing that the Utah Cav
alry, commanded by Captain Came, Is
here on a good mission, which it Is cred
itably fulfilling by driving from Yosemite
National Park sheepherders found tres
passing with thousands of sheep. Lieu
tenant Klmball, in charge of a detail
patrolling the eastern section, arrested
and sent In yesterday by Sergeant Price
nine sheep men with animals and packs.
Their sheep were scattered, and unless
they are cared for by the men's confed
erates the loss to the owners will be
heavy. Another detail from the north
western boundary brought in five men
found with stock grazing in the park.
Lieutenant Kimball is still patrolling the
park, and as numerous bands are known
to be within the park limits, many ar
rests will undoubtedly follow.
One band of sheep dispersed by Lieu
tenant Klmball is said to belong to Mr.
Shubert of San Francisco.
Some of the herders captured opposed
arrest, causing trouble by refusing to
surrender when ordered to do so by Ser
geant Price.
Thoy reluctantly submitted, however,
when covered by firearms. They were
compelled to walk from the place of ar
rrst to Camp Wood, thirty miles dis
tant. To prevent their escape at night
the men were divested of most of their
clothing. A number of fires known to
have been recently started in the park
were set, it is thought, by the sheep men.
who thought the soldiers would be kept
so busy extinguishing them as to find no
time to molest their flocks In the park.
Because of the dry season there is a
scarcity of water throughout the park.
Many streams are dry, and thousands
of trout which were sent this season from
the hatchery at Wawona have died.

LAVA SPREADS IN

The EruptioQ of Vesuvius Causiog
Gloomy Â£3pprehensior)s Among
People Living Near By.
NAPLES, Sept. 18. â A state of gloomy apprehension prevails
among the population regarding the eruption of Vesuvius, which
is hourly becoming more active and menacing. Streams of lava are
spreading in every direction. The most threatening of these flows
through the Vedrino Valley, which i.= almost filled. The observatory
which originally stood at a height of 610 meters, is now only twen
ty-seven meters above the sea level, owing to the sinking of the
ground. Seven new craters have formed around the central one,
and this has not tended to diminish the fears formerly felt, which
were based upon the eruption of stones and scoria similar to that
which occurred in 1872.

SPANISH RULE
IS IMPOSSIBLE
Philippine Archbishop
Interviewed.
FAVORS AMERICAN CONTROL
RELIGIOUS ORDERS, HE SAYS,
MUST GO.
Most Vigorous Opponents of Liberty.
Spanish Soldiers Would Like
to Become American
Citizens.
MANILA, Sept. 18.â In an interview
with him by the correspondent of the
Associated Press, Archbishop Dosal of
the Philippine Islands said:
"I earnestly hope the islands will not
remain Spanish, because the rebels are
now so strong that such a course would
Inevitably cause appalling bloodshed.
The reconquest of the natives is im
possible until after years of the most
cruel warfare."
He also expressed the hope that the
Islands would not become absolutely In
dependent because it was certain that
dissensions would occur which would
result in incessant strife and a lapse
into barbarism through the natural in
dolence of the country. The only hope,
the Archbishop declared, was that a
strong Western power would intervene
now. Delay is dangerous, as the peo
ple are Intoxicated and restless.
He said it was undeniable that the
religious orders must go, but the whole
people had determined to abolish them
now that they were able to render their
retention impossible. He mid the
chief blame upon the Dominicans and
Franciscan Receletants, the richest or
ders, and next upon the Benedictines
and Capuchins, which are of lesser im
portance. The Jesuits, Archbishop
Dosal says, are comparatively docile.
He added that the rival orders are the
most vigorous opponents of liberty.
The provincials, who are approxi
mately equal to archdeacons, are
mainly responsible. They are utterly
beyond the control of the archbishop,
who denies possession of their power.
The total number of Spanish priests
In the Philippines before the war was
about 1000, but lately every departing
steamer has taken fifty or a hundred
of them away and now barely fifty are
here. He says he wishes to strengthen
himself.
Several responsible Spanish min
isters assured the correspondent that
they would refuse to remain here if
Spain was reinstated in control of the
island. Many Spanish soldiers refuse
to serve again and Spanish officers are
disgusted with the rottenness of
Spanish government and prefer to be
come American citizens. The annexa
tionists have a majority, but the dis
cussion of the subject has not been fin
ished.

Th|E TRODE SITUATION.
NOTHING could be tamer than trade at present.
There is no feature out of the common hum
drum course of business, as far as anybody can
bee. The commercial statistical authority., chronicle
the usual schedule of comparative bank clearings,
comparative failures, comparative exports, and so on.
The current year shows up well enough under this
cold-blooded comparative business, though it is de
ficient in several directions. Thus the bank clearings
of the county last week were 4 per cent behind those
of the corresponding week last year, and those of San
Francisco have been running behind for some weeks
owing to the recent dry season, as already mentioned.
The loss last week was particularly heavy in New
York, where it ran up to 32 per cent, and was due to
the falling off in speculation in Wall street and to
contraction in financial operations through fear of a
possible tight money market. These apprehensions,
however, seemed to disappear at the close of the
week, as the market strengthened considerably under
foreign and local buying, and the day of the bears
was much curtailed thereby.
Merchandise conditions remain practically un
changed. The railway earnings arc still ahead of last
year, and this indicates a larger business, but whether
this larger business is attended with the profit of
former years is a question which is doubted in some
quarters. The great staples continue dull as a rule
at unchanged prices. Some cotton mills have
stopped, while as an offset some woolen mills report
more business. Hides and leather are in fair shape,
but not active. Wheat has moved up somewhat dur
ing the week The week's failures were 174, against
204 for the same week last year.
The local markets share the commonplace as
pects of the national ones. The whole field
is barren of feature, if a certain hardening tendency
in wheat during the past few days be excepted.
Nobody seems to know exactly why wheat
should go up at the moment, but it has cer
tainly improved during the past week, and closed
firm, though very dull. Following the governing
cereal, barley was also strong at a slight advance,
and hay likewise developed more strength, closing the
week with small advances in some descriptions. In
deed, the whole list of farm products appeared in bet
ter shape than at the close of the preceding week,
though there was no especial activity.
The fruit season is drawing to a close. It has been
a profitable one to the State on the whole, with indi
vidual losses here and there, but some people are al
ready beginning to worry about next year. They
fear that the present season has been so dry that the
fruit buds for next year's crops will not develop,
hence 1899 will turn out deficient in fruit, like 1898.
This may prove true, but there is no use in trying to
cross a bridge before one gets to it. There will be
plenty of time next year to worry about next year's
fruit crop.
Jobbers and exporters of merchandise are not com
plaining about trade, so it is natural to infer that they
are doing fairly. For the rest, collections are reported
average, failures are still running small and generally j
unimportant, and the supply of money is in excess of !
the demand as a rule.
Briefly, business is in that condition where it is
impossible to find much to say about it one way or
the other. As long as it remains thus we are all
right.
By the appointment of a committeee to examine
the evidence given in the Dreyfus case and deter
mine whether a new hearing should be gTanted the
French Government has taken the first step in the
direction of justice, and the next one will be easier.
When Alford. Gould and McNab appointed that
committee of one hundred cooks to stir and skim the
Democratic broth in this city, it never occurred to
them that the cooks might run away with the pot
and swallow the whole mess.
Possibly the rumor that English stockholders in
tend to make war upon Huntington will fail to alarm
the old gentleman. In fact, were he not engaged in
a fight with somebody he would probably think life
not worth living.
Many anarchists are leaving Europe for America.
Possibly this will be pleasing information for Ma
guire, but the rest of the country will not like it
The committee of one hundred bosses will now
present the Democrats with a committed ticket and
ask "What are you going to do about it?"
The only definite and positive statement that Ma
guire has thus far made during the campaign is that
his middle name is not Gallagher.
It is not the nigger in the African woodpile that

There is a depressing outlook in the Botkin case

THE SAST FBASTCISCO CALL, MOISIPAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1898.
THE HUNDRED BOSSES.
ONCE the people of Athens, finding the rule
of the Pisistratid family intolerable, rose in
revolt, drove out the kings and established
their government in the hands of a council of thirty
members. That council became known to history as
the "Thirty Tyrants," and its exactions, oppressions
and public plunderings were far worse than any com
mitted by the royal despots.
Once the people of Rome, after expelling the Tar
quin kings, intrusted their government to a council
of ten. This council, known as the Decemvirs, stands
recorded as one of the most infamous governing
powers in the annals of nations.
Once the people of Israel gave their government
into the hands of a council of Judges, and Holy
Writ records of them that they were "the sons of
Belial and served not the Lord."
Once the people of France overthrew their mon
archy and chose to rule over them a convention
known as a constituent assembly, and the deeds of
that assembly constitute the blackest and bloodiest
page of tyranny and terror known to modern times.
History repeats itself. On a small scale and in
petty degrees the Democrats of Sam Francisco are ex
periencing the woes that befall any people or body
of men who put into power an irresponsible council,
sufficiently numerous in its membership for each man
to shift the blame for bad actions upon another, but
still so small as to be a clique rather than a true rep
resentation of the body it has been called upon to
govern.
The council of one hundred bosses of the San
Francisco Democracy has been in power but a short
time, and yet it has gone far along the path pursued
by the Thirty Tyrants, the Decemvirs, the Sons of
Belial and the makers of the Reign of Terror. It has
assumed to itself all the powers of an arbitrary and
wholly irresponsible assembly. Appointed for the
sole purpose of arbitrating the disputes between the
contending factions in the party in this city, it at
once set itself up as the permanent head of the party.
It named the delegates to the State convention
from this city, and by pledging them beforehand
named the candidate for Governor and other mem
bers of the State ticket. . Now it transforms itself
into a county convention, and on Monday night will
nominate all candidates for county and municipal
offices and for the legislative districts.
Never before in the history of American politics
has such a violent usurpation of the rights of the
members of a party been even so much as attempted.
The annals of Tammany Hall furnish no parallel to
it. What has been done in this city by Higgins,
Buckley, Mannix, Brady, Crimmins and Kelly is as
nothing in comparison with the boldness and shame
less audacity of the scheme. Other bosses have
worked their parties to the raw, but the hundred sons
of Belial have skinned Democracy.
In defense of their action the members of the coun
cil make the plea of hypocrites, "We are doing it
for the public good"; the plea of the Pharisees, "We
are more honest than other men"; the plea of con
fidence operators, "You can trust us, for we are
pious." Behind these pleas made ostentatiously to
the public there are threats and menaces to indi
viduals of the party, "We will ruin you if you op
pose us."
If the Democrats of San Francisco submit to this
dictation and support a ticket or even a single can
didate nominated by this self-constituted convention
they will have virtually abdicated the functions of
American citizenship. They will have ceased to be
members of a self-governing party and become the
blind followers of a clique more vicious than any
boss and more greedy than the henchmen that the
boss employs.
VOLUNTEERS IN MODERN WAR.
GENERAL WHEELER'S recent statement
that the United States must have a larger
force than at present of thoroughly trained
professional soldiers to do its fighting has added
new strength to the growing demand for an increase
of the regular army and for an even greater propor
tionate enlargement of the staff. The experience of
the short war with Spain seems to have been conclu
sive on the subject, and now there is very little in the
way of argument to be heard on the other side.
The authority of General Wheeler as an expert on
military matters is well established, nor can he be
justly charged with prejudice on the side of the regu
lars. It is true that he was trained at West Point
and has been educated to look upon war problems
from the standpoint of a professional soldier. On
the other hand, however, his whole military service
has been that of commanding volunteers. Both in
the Civil War and in the Santiago campaign his
troops have been of that class. He has, therefore,
close affiliations with volunteers and is not likely to
underrate their soldierly qualities or misjudge their
capacity for downright hard fighting.
As a matter of fact in what Wheeler and others
have urged as arguments for a larger regular army
there is nothing disparaging to either the courage,
the endurance or the loyalty of the volunteers. The
one point is that war in these days has become a
science which must bfc learned by study and by prac
tice. It is not the natural method of fighting which
is instinctive in the brave, but a matter of tactics and
skill which it takes time and training to acquire.
An illustration of one defect in the volunteer is
given in a criticism of the campaign around San
tiago by a British officer who was detailed by his
Government to observe it. As this officer, being a
foreigner, writes more critically than our own offi
cers would like to do, his words are worth considera
tion. He states that the losses of the Americans in
battle on the day of the hardest fighting were much
larger than they should have been, and that the cause
was the impatience of Roosevelt and his Rough
Riders to charge the enemy at once.
The critic maintains that Roosevelt should have
held his men back until the force sent to flank the
Spanish position had turned the wings and got an
enfilading fire on the center. Had that course been
followed the British observer of the fight is sanguine
the Spaniards would have been forced to retreat and
we would have captured their lines with a much
smaller loss of officers and men than we actually suf
fered.
A fearful demonstration of the evil consequences of
excessive valor in war in these days was given in the
slaughter of the daring Dervishes by the British torce
under General Kitchener in the recent battles in the
Soudan. Our brave volunteers escaped lightly in the
war with Spain, but were they confronted by a really
dangerous foe an attempt to rush things would be
terribly disastrous.
Among the defects of volunteer forces, therefore,
may be included an over"-confidence in sheer valor
and an over-eager desire on the part of officers and
men alike to distinguish themselves. This, taken to
gether with a lack of understanding of the compli
cated armaments of the age and a failure to appre
ciate the advantage of tactics, exposes volunteers to
heavy losses. It is therefore an economy of life as
well as of money to provide professional soldiers for
war purposes, and since it seems that we are to have
wars, the expediency of providing for a more thor
ough training of our National Guard and the en
largement of the regular army is not to be disputed.
BARNES ON THE SENATORSHIP.
GENERAL BARNES has rarely been more for
cible or more eloquent than in the address
with which he opened the Republican cam
paign in this city on Saturday evening. He presented
in a striking manner the importance of the issues to
be determined by the popular vote in November, and
showed not only the weakness of the opposition party
and the personal inconsistencies of the opposition
candidate, Maguire, but the genuine strength of the
Republican position â a strength which, as the orator
pointed out, is so invincible that the fused factions
of opposition dare not directly assail it in this or in
any other State in the Union.
Able and interesting as the speech was throughout,
the most notable portion was that relating to the
United States Senatorship. General Barnes clearly
announced his own candidacy, and in dealing with
that of M. H. de Young said: "I do not care who
the man is, I don't care what newspaper he owns, if
he does not come up to the standard that has been
required of the United States Senators from this State
hitherto, he cannot be elected Senator, and all the
bosses that God ever spawned upon earth cannot
make him one."
No man who has any acquaintance with the senti
ment of the people of California, or with that of
Republicans only, will question the accuracy of that
statement. California has not been always strongly
represented in the Senate, her Senators have not al
ways taken high rank among the great statesmen of
the nation, but, as General Barnes said: "It has been
a very good list. Go back to Casserley (Democrat),
Hager (Democrat), Farley (Democrat), Sargent
(Republican), Stanford (Republican), Felton (Re
publican), White (Democrat), and Perkins (Repub
lican) â they are all gentlemen."
The people of the State intend to uphold that stan
dard. Any aspirant for the Senate who does not
measure up to the requirements dares not to openly
announce his candidacy. He can hope for success
only by secrecy during the campaign and the work
of the bosses afterward.
It was altogether right and fitting that the orator
chosen to open the Republicon campaign in San
Francisco should make this subject an impressive
feature of his address. It is important to the party.
The people know it, and it is time for the bosses
themselves to take heed.
THE STATE LIBRARY.
rRANK L. COOMBS, State Librarian, in his
report just filed with the Governor for the forty
eighth and forty-ninth fiscal years, ending June
30, 1898, makes ar. excellent showing for the institu
tion generally and has the satisfaction of submitting
a financial statement which discloses that the library
has on hand the considerable balance of $8968.
In one respect, however, the report is not of a
nature to be gratifying either to the librarian or to
the public. The usefulness of the institution is not
commensurate with its value or the cost of its main
tenance. As Mr. Coombs points out, the real value
of a library lies in its utility. If the State library
was designed and is supported by taxation merely to
be a storehouse of art and literature it fulfills its pur
pose, but if it was intended to serve the requirements
of the people for books it falls far short of its object.
Several suggestions are put forth as to the best
means of making the library widely and increasingly
useful to the people. The most important of these is
the one which The Call has repeatedly presented, that
of establishing a traveling library system with the
State library as a central storehouse, from which
volumes could be sent out to all parts of the State
for general reading.
This system is not one of experiment. It has been
thoroughly tested in many Eastern States and has
been found to be of great advantage to the thousands
of intelligent men and women who live in commu
nities where no great public libraries are maintained.
So successful has it been in practice that in every
State where it has been tried it is being rapidly ex
tended, and other States are arranging to adopt it.
California should not lag behind the progressive
commonwealths of the Union in a matter of this kind.
We have one of the finest State libraries in the na
tion, and it is folly not to so administer it as to give
the people the full benefit of it.
UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS.
TvVO great educational institutions in New Eng
land, Amherst College and Brown University,
are at present engaged in a search for a presi
dent. In the New England States there are many
professors of ability and learning, but neither Am
herst nor Brown has been in a hurry to select a
presiding officer and chief executive from among
them. The trustees of each institution are well
aware that something more than fair ability and good
scholarship are needed in the head of a university in
these days, and they are looking for a strong natural
leader of men rather than an eminent scientist or
philosopher.
The University of California can offer much more
in the way of salary and opportunity for far-reaching
work than either of the two New England institu
tions. It ought, therefore, to easily win away from
them the strongest man now available for university
employment, but in order to do so the regents must
widen the field of their choice to include merit and
executive ability wherever they are found. Amherst
and Brown will not confine their search for the right
man to their States or even the New England group.
Neither should we confine ours to California.
There is no position in the world more promising
to an ambitious aspirant for fame and honor in the
upbuilding of a great university and the advancement
of learning than that which the presidency of the
University of California will offer. By reason of
causes which are inherent in the very nature of things,
California is destined to become one of the dominant
commonwealths of the Union, and San Francisco will
be one of the intellectual and artistic centers of the
world.
The university in which that intellectual life has its
source and glory will of necessity be an institution
of great potency and worldwide fame. It may well
excite the emulation of progressive scholars to be
among the leaders and directors of its career, and it
seems certain that the regents will find no difficulty
in obtaining the service of any man whom they may
esteem worthy of the honor.
One by one the obstacles between Dreyfus and a
fair deal seem to be disappearing. Some of them
commit suicide, and some adopt the more robust
method of resigning from office.
Alger is to be congratulated. The President, who
has already done him many favors, freely assents
to the proposition to have him investigated.
Why not annex England and get lomething worth
having?
A MAGDA IN THE LIFE.
Nance O'Neil's Are the Ambitions, Vicissi
. tudes and Victories of Sudermann's
Heroine.
BY ASHTON STEVENS.
During the waits In a rehearsal of
"The Jewess" at the Columbia yester
day morning Miss Nance O'Neil eat on
a box of properties and talked to me
about plays, people and critics and
things and herself. Especially about
herself and about one play â "Magda."
And In the -ife, ambitions and convic
tions of Nance O'Neil there is a tre-
Praying for Y\er F a >'ure.
mendous resemblance to those of Su
dermann's heroine.
Miss O'Neil has played the part of
Magda many times. She says that it
appeals to her more strongly than any
other character In modern literature.
She had intended to open her engage
ment with It to-night, and told me so
with her own lovely voice. But there
is a suit on about the American rights
to the piece, and so she had to change
the bill to "The Jewess."
"Anyway, there is Modjeska across
the street at the Baldwin." I said by
way of comfort; "she is something cf a
Sudermann specialist herself. We had
her Magda only last week."
"So much the better," said Miss
Belascoed by RaoK>nÂ«
O'Neil, "for then San Francisco knows
the power and depth of the play. I
have never seen Modjeska's Magda,
nor rxise's, nor Bernhordt's, and I
don't want to see any of them. Imita
tion is too easy and seductive. I avoid
other people's characters as you would
avoid illustrations in a book. They In
terfere with your own individual con
ception and Interpretation. My Magda
is my own, and,' l think, the best thing
I do; and now that I am back home
and a star with a certain amount of
reputation and all that sort of thing, I
would like to show it to my old frienda.
Well, maybe this suit about the rights
will be over next week; if so, you shall
see me in the part, sure."
I said that I would give almost any
thing for the chance â and I would. If
the life of an actress ever has anything
to do with equipping her for the emo
tions of a role, then surely Nance
O'Neil must bring a deal of personal
feeling and conviction into her persona- *
tion of Magda. Her life has been as
Magda's. She went forth Into the

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The fiftieth anniversary of thÂ© German
navy will be celebrated on November 9.
The cruiser ordered at Elblng by the
Russian admiralty is to have 17,000 horse
power and a guaranteed speed of 25 knots.
According to official reports from the
British Admiralty the Powerful made the
run from Yokohama to Hongkong last
month, averaging 20^ knots during twen
ty-four hours and consumed 540 tons of
coal.
It is only a few years ago that the Ger
man Iron-clad Kaiser of 7531 tons, built in
1574, was almost entirely rebuilt and al
tered. She Is, however, again in the hands
of mechanics at the Kiel dockyard under

she was "discovered" by that Irrepres

the subject of a column of hilarious
praise in the next day's Journal. Then
the other critics rushed over to
the Murray Hill Theater, and. according
to their styles and temperaments,

under trial conditions. The contract called
for 32 knots with 6500 horsepower.
The Komet and Meteor, torpedo gun
boats in the German navy, are laid up at
Kiel, having proved themselves failures
The Komet of 942 tons was built In 1892,
and the Meteor of 946 tons was built in
1890. They were calculated to have a speed
of 21 knots, but the latter boat never
reached it, as her horsepower fell short
of the contract, developing only 4500 in
stead of 6000.
The Terrible, sister ship to the Powerful,
has been undergoing certain overhauling
to her machinery at the Portsmouth dock
yard, with a view of overcoming the ex
cessive vibrations at high speed. She is
now believed to have overcome this
trouble, and during a thirty hours* run at
sea last month averaged 20H knots with
the tide and sea against her, the engines
developing 18,000 horsepower.
The recent theft of a signal book from
a British warship by one of tho quarter
masters has led to the issuance of strin
gent orders relative to the safe custody
of these important books. They are to
be inspected every week by captains of
the ships, and before any officer is allowed
access to them for instructional purposes
he is to Bign an undertaking for their
safekeeping. Officers of watches will also
be held responsible for handing over the
books to their successors on duty.
The new Russian cruisers are to be ex
ceptionally speedy. Six of 6000 tons will
be 400 feet in length, 53 feet beam and only
20 feet draught, with engines of 18 000
horsepower to give 23 knots speed Pour
cruisers of 3000 tons will be 385 feet in
length, 40 feet beam and 16 feet draught
and are to steam 25 knots. "Ehe battery
of the 6000-ton cruisers will consist of
twelve 6-inch, twelve 12-pounders and six
6-pounders, and that of the smaller crui
sers six 4.7-lnch and six 6-pounders be
sides six torpedo tubes. Both classes are

has completed her sixty hours' trial at
sea under three-quarter full power The
ship steamed from Spithead to Cape Fin
isterre and returned to Spithead August
27. She was down to a mean draught of
26 feet 3 inches, or one foot over the nor
mal draught. With 270 pounds of steam
and 105.4 revolutions the engines devel
oped 12,791 horsepower, and gave an aver
age speed of 19.3 knots, which was consid
ered highly satisfactory, as the coal was
of a poor quality. With the full power of
16,500 a speed of 20%_knots is calculated
It Is a noticeable fact that of the many
orders placed in France, Germany and the
United States for Russian war vessels not
a single ship has been given to any of the
yards in Great Britain, and that country
is gradually losing a very lucrative busi
ness. Twenty years ago British shin
yards turned out naval vessels for prac
tically all other European powers, as well
as for South American republics, China
and Japan. At the present time Russia
18 no longer aepenaem on wirai. "i :i ""i
for naval vessels, and Germany not felone
builds her own ships, but is a formidul^
competitor for foreign orders. Japan in
a few years, will also be entirely independ
ent of foreign builders and British ship
yards will either not be considered wl'.en
naval orders are given out or must come
down below the figures of France aad
Germany. _

Theatrical Managers Discuss a Rufe to Squefcfi the
Richfy Dressed Late-Comers,
WHETHER or not the major
ity who arrive at the thea
ter before the curtain goes
up shall be annoyed and
have their pleasure Inter
rupted by the minority who
come late Is a matter that
is attracting the attention of the the-
U managers of the city.
The discussion of the subject was
t about by the publication In
ill recently of a rule which is
fully enforced in Eastern cit
â : In one of the popular theaters
of Denver. The adopted rule Is as
follows:
"Patrons arriving after the rise of
rtaln will not be seated until
after the close of the act in progress
at the time of their arrival. Accom
modations will be provided for seat
ing late corners In the rear of the the
ater until that time. This action is
taken in justice to those who have
cultivate the commendable habit of
being punctual."
While the managers all agree as to
the justice and desirability of such
a rule and would be as glad to hall
its general advent as they were that
of the ordinance which made Captain
Hottanzi famous, and relegated for all
time the big theater hat to its proper
place, they do not think it can be
made a success in San Francisco.
â¢'The rule Is a very pruptr one and I
sincerely hope some way may be found
to bring about Its adoption in an ef
fective' manner," said J. J. Gottlob of
the firm of Friedlander, Gottlob &
Co., managers of the Baldwin, Colum
bia and California theaters. "For in
. you tuk'- such i>lays as were

utmost quiet and attention were re
quired for their proper appreciation.

who arrived promptly to have people
come stringing in all through the first
act, spoiling the scenes for others and
distracting the players.
"The women are the worst culprits
in this respect," continued Mr. Gott
lob. "In many instances this late com
ing is the result of false pride. Some
have si beautiful new gown or wrap,
and it is necessary that they should

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1898.
DR. BURNETT`S
WIFE PLAYS A
DOUBLE GAME
Now She Is Without
a Husband.
DIVORCE HAS BEEN GRANTED
SHE ADMITS THAT SHE LOVES
DR. FRANKLIN Â£. DUNCAN.
The Rival Young Medico Has Been
Very Attentive to Her Since
They First Met at a Danc
ing School.
It was in the autumn of 1891 that Dr.
Georgf* W. Burnett, a popular young
druggist whose store is on Turk street,
became acquainted with a divorced
woman named Lena W. Geantlt, who was
five years his senior. She was a rather
bright and attractive person, and the
doctor (ell hi love with her, proposed
marriage and was accepted. His father,
G. G. Burnett, who was known as a capi
talist, and who for many years conducted
a drug store at 327 Montgomery street,
strenuously opposed the marriage. The
son, nevertheless, made Lena W. Geantlt
his wife, and he h&s lived to repent it.
He probably â wishes now that his father s
objections had prevailed, although he is
now a free man, having secured a di
vorce. He charged his wife with in
fidelity, and at the trial before Judge
Trout offered the most convincing 1 tosti
mony from several witnesses. Judge
Trout decreed to Pr. r?urnett two city
lots south of Golden Gate Park, and
this coast, and through a lifetime of
experience I have evolved the Idea
that I don't want to pose as a re
former. The other fellows can do that.
I believe In conducting my theater In
the same manner that a first-class
dry-goods house is runâ keep what the
people want and give it to them with
out playing favorites. This matter of
punctual and late coming is between
the playgoers, and if the early comers,
who are the majority, cannot suppress
the objectionable late comers It is their
own fault. In this matter, notwith
standing it would be very delightful to
have such a rule accepted, I propose to
keep right in the middle of the road.
I have had enough of trying to' reg
ulate these swelled-head young bucks
who think that because they have
bought a seat or two they own the
theater. They are the fellows who
would block this game, for they have
neither manners nor sense."
"Such a rule could not be success
fully applied to a vaudeville house,"
said Manager Morriaty of th* Or
pheum, "but if I were running a legit
imate house I would expect to make
a failure if I did not protect the best
class of my patrons in that way.
These late comers don't care for the
play. They are the kind of people
who will pay $7 to hear Melba, and
not arrive until the latter part of the
first act. They don't understand the
music and don't care to, but they
know how to make themselves con
spicuous and a nuisance to those who
are there to enjoy the attraction."
The New Comedy Theater has
adopted the rule and put it in force
successfully on Monday night.
"Our theory," said Manager Klling
house, "Is to at all times- comply with
the wishes of our patrons in every
possible way, and in justice to our
early comers we are in duty bound to
carry out the policy of instructing
our ushers to seat the house to the rise
of the curtain on the first act, then
to keep in waiting until each act is
at an end for the seating of patrons
that may enter the auditorium, who
would then be seated, between acts.
This policy is being carried to a
successful issue In all the leading thea
ters In the East, and should be adopt
ed by the local theaters of this city.
We appeal to our patrons in this
cause, as our policy in the future
will be carried out as above an
nounced."
awarded to him the custody of the only
child, Lucille P. Burnett, aged six years.
To the defendant the court Rave tne
household furniture in the residence at
638 Haight street, which for some years,
has been the home of the couple.
The co-respondent is a handsome young
doctor, Franklin T. Duncan, a recent
graduate of the San Francisco College ot
Physicians and Surgeons, and who not
long ago opened a pharmacy in the Press
Club building on Ellis street. Dr. Dun
can tirst met Mrs. Burnett at a Sutter
street dancing school, where In the giddy
mazes of the whirling and entrancing
waltz he became enchanted with her, at
least so goes the story, which is wen
corroborated by the allegations set forth
in the petition for divorce and proven by
the testimony of the several witnesses
who related many events following the
dancing school friendship, dating back
about eighteen months.
Last summer, while Dr. Duncan was
an attache of the Soldiers' Home at
Yountville, he was visited by Mrs. Bur
nett, whom he Introduced to the other
resident physicians as his wifa.
Another charge was that Dr. Duncan
made his home at the Burnett residence
during the absence of Dr. Burnett In
Southern California several weeks last
fail.
Dr. Burnett, last spring, suspecting that
his wife was playing him false, separ
ated from her. It was not until quitÂ©
recently, however, that he obtained the
proof necessary to warrant a suit for di
vorce. When he started to secure the evi
dence it came thick and fast. It was
brought out in the evidence that on one
occasion Dr. Burnett returned home un
expectedly, Dr. Duncan retreated from
the house through the back door, vaulted
over a high fence with all the ease and
agility of a Kymnast, and sped away
with the swiftness of a professional
sprinter, much to the astonishment as
well as amusement of some of the neigh
bors who witnessed the incident.
Dr. Duncan and Mrs. Burnett werÂ« ac
cused of having frequently met in a
clandestine manner, of having attended
theaters and taken late dinners together,
and so on, while the husband was faith
fully compounding prescriptions In his
Turk-street drug store.
At the trial Mrs. Burnett admitted that
she loved Dr. Duncan and did not care
for her husband. Dr. Duncan and Mrs.
Burnett have been seen in each other's
company quite frequently since the di
vorce suit, and It would not be at aJI
surprising to learn of their marriage in
the near future.

DEATH OF J. ROSS
BROWNE'S WIDOW
HER HUSBAND WAS MINISTER
TO CHINA.
Was Also Widely Known as a Gifted
Author, a Traveler and an
Able Journalist.
The demise in Oakland of Mrs. Lucy
Anrie Browne on Friday last and her In
terment yesterday afternoon will recall
to the pioneers of this State and the
residents of a generation ago the memory
of her gifted husband, J. Ross Browne.
The latter, who preceded his wife to the
grave in 1875, was born in Ireland in 1822
and came to America as a mere child. He
rounded the Horn in 1849 and spent sev
eral years in this vicinity. He then went
to Europe and the Holy Land and pub
lished "Vusef, a Crusade in the East,"
an interesting account of personal ex
perience of the Old World then seldom
visited by travelers. Returning to Cali
fornia in 1855 he won high favor from the
Government in investigating Indian af
fairs. He revisited Europe in 1860 as cor
respondent far the Sacramento Union and
Harper's Magazine.
Although of a roving disposition Mr
Browne llnally settled down in the foot
hills of Oakland, and his residence known
as Pagoda Hill, attracted much attention
because of its Oriental style of architec
ture. In IS<* he succeded Burlingame as
Minister to China, and in October, 1575 he
passed away at his home across the bay.
Among hia contributions to literature
outside of his newspaper and magazine
work are "An American Family in Ger
many," "The Land of Thor," "Apache
Land" and "Crusoe's Island."
Mrs. Browne, who closely shared with
her husband his rambles in strange and
out-of-the-way places, had reached the
age of i 2 years. She was a woman of
great personal worth and leaves a large
circle of friends to mourn her loss
POLICEMAN WOUNDED.
Murderous Assault Upon C. M.
Barnes on Fifteenth and Mis
sion Streets.
As a result of a disturbance at a dance
hall on Mission and Fifteenth streets
early yesterday morning Policeman C.
M. Barnes is in St. Mary's Hospital suf
fering- from a severe lacerated wound of
the scalp, and it was by the merest
chance that his skull was not fractured.
About 3 o'clock Barnes was notifleu
that a hackman was creating; a disturb
ance in the cloak room in the dance hall.
He went there and found A. J. Morrison',
proprietor of livery stables on Mission
street, near Eighteenth, disputing with
a member of the committee. At the re
quest of the latter Barnes took posses
sion of Morrison and led him to the side
walk and told him to take his hack away.
Morrison refused and struck Barnes in
the face. A crowd had gathered and one
of them hit Barnes on the back of the
head with a blunt instrument, dazing
him. Barnes wheeled round and seeing
a man running away fired a couple of
shots in his direction to intimidate him,
but he escaped.
Policeman Connell. hearing- the shots
camps to Barnes' assistance, and Morri
son was taken to the Seventeenth street
station, where charges of battery and
resisting an officer were booked against
him. Barnes was taken to the Receiving 1
Hospital and later to St. Mary's Hos
pital.
Later a young man was arrested and
placed in "the tanks" on suspicion of
being the user of the blunt instrument,
and will be detained to w> if he can be
Identified. Barnes has been a terror to
the rowdy element on Sixteenth street
since he has been on the beat, and it is
thought that had something to do with
the murderous assault upon him.
The organization of the official Repub
lican Club will take place at Pixley Hall,
1534 Pacific avenue, on Tuesday evening,
September 20, IS9B. â¢
Stockton Too Hot to Wounds.
John Riley, who claims to have fired
the last shot on the Alabama during: her
engagement with the Kearsarge In June,
1564. made his appearance at the Receiv
ing Hospital yesterday morning to have a
gunshot wound in his left arm dressed.
Riley said he was shot by a man named
Pete Clark, owing to his religion, about
ten days ago. and as it was too hot in
Stockton he determined to come here till
his wounded arm was better. Riley lives
on an ark in McLeods Lake, Stockton.

INCOMPLETE
REPORT ON THE
CITY TAX LEVY
Will Be Presented to
the Supervisors.
THE RESULT OF A TANGLE
COMMITTEE ON FINANCE TO
SHUT RESPONSIBILITY.
It Has Disagreed on the Large Ap
propriations, but on the Small
Ones There Was a Unani
mity of Opinion.
The Supervisors will meet this morn-
Ing at 10 o'clock to consider the tax levy.
The Finance Committee will present an
Incomplete report, but will not present it
in the customary way. Certain minor
appropriations will be recommended
unanimously by Chairman Rottanzi,
Devany and Haskins, but the report will
state that the chairman disagrees with
the other two members of the committee
regarding appropriations for streets and
the Mission zoo. Rottanzi wants to cut
the street department appropriation and
drop the zoo park altogether for the pres
ent. In conclusion the committee will
state that it cannot agree on these items
and will ask the board to step In and set
tle the matters at Issue without reference
to the committee. No total levy will be
suggested.
These statements are authoritative,
being made by one member of the Fi
nance Committee. He further stated that
the meeting of the Finance Committee on
Saturday evening was the last held on the
subject of the levy, no second meeting
being called for Sunday.
There were several chance meetings
yesterday between Supervisors Britt, De
lany, Rivers, Sheehan and Haskins.
There was considerable private discussion
pro and con on the subject of the Mission
zoo. This proposed "improvemervt" is the
hardest one on which to reach an agree
ment.
The Indications are that the even split
In the board will make the morning ses
sion to-day interesting. In view of the
fact that the law compels the Super
visors to fix the levy before they adjourn
this afternoon, the probabilities are that
some form of a compromise between the
6lx favoring $1 40 as the municipal rate
and the six who advocate $1 20 will be
made. In this event $1 30 may be the final
figure.
The whole Moslem race despise and
hate the sound of bells, which they say
cause the evil spirits to assemble to
gether. In consequence they are never
used on Mohammedan mosques.

OLYMPICS WON
THE CYCLERS'
BIG ROAD RACE
First in Every Heat of
the Twenty-Mile.
SPLENDID TEAM WORK DID IT
WINGS TIME CLOSE TO THE EX
ISTING BECOBD.
Bay City Wheelmen and Acme Club
Lost Ground by an Accident
at the Start and Were
"Not in It."
The Olympic Club Wheelmen gained
fresh laurels yesterday, when their team
of five men won the annual twenty-mile
road race of the California Associated
Cycling Clubs at San Leandro, every
Olympic man being a winner in his par
ticular heat of the race.
Yesterday's event was one of the four
big road races conducted annually by the.
association, and the trophy contested for
is the most valuable of them all, being a
Wing of Olympics Sprints Home a Fast Winner.
magnificent cup donated by BaJcer A
Hamilton. In the first trial two years ago
the cup was won by the Acme Club of
Oakland. I,ast yMr the Bay Oltys cap
tured it. These two clubs were the only
ones In the race yesterday besides the
Olympics, the Bay Citys running Into sec
ond place and the Acmes third.
The Olympic team was the best organ
ized, and their men were trained to the
liour. Their pacemakers were well dis
tributed, and every condition foretold
that they would be returned victors. The
Bay Cltys, who ordinarily carry off the
palm for perfection of details, did not
put up so good a showing as usual. Peck,
the champion of the coast, rode for them,
but he was out of condition and had a
bad fall, which caused him to lose three
minutes to hlÂ« Olympic opponent.
The best performance of the day was
made by J.E. Wing of the Olympic team,
who covered the twenty-mile course In
52 minutes 'XI seconds. While this time
doea n<it equal last year's record of 52 vi.
It Is very good, considering the condition
of the roads and the strong head wind
the riders had to buck against at certain
stages of the journey.
The race was started at I'ltchburg at Jl
o'clock. Fitchburg Is about three miles
west of San L.eanoro. Taking the county
road to San Leandro the riders then tra
versed the famous triangular course
twice, making the total uistanco of twen
ty miles, the llniah beinp In San I,eandro.
One man from each team, making a group
of three riders, with single, tandem and
triplet pricing machines In the lead ad
libitum, started at the appointed time, an
other bunch five minutes later, and so
on until the Jive groups were on their
way.
There was a bad spill shortly after the
first bunch started, in which the riders
â¢were Kragness (Olympic). Peck (Bay
City) and Ferris (Acme). Peck ran into
a tandem that was riding too close and
fell, taking Ferris down with him. Krag
ness escaped and got a lead of fuiiy a
quarter of a mile before the others could
borrow new wheels, remount and get
moving again. As it was both were con
siderably used up by the fall, and Krag
reps beat them in over three minutes at
the tape.
Fuller, Xoonan and Squires kept pretty
well together in the â  second bunch. Ful
ler winning in the sprint at tne finish by
three-fifths of a second. , .
Wing made his fast time in the third. '
beating Llnd (Acme) by two minutes and
Davidson (Bay City) by nearly three,
though the latter was 111 and not at his
host.
Bozlo landed tho Olympics winners of
the fourth by the narrowest of leads over j
Black (Bay City) and Smith (Acme).
Russ rounded out the decisive Olympic
victory by a two-minute gain over the
Acme man and one and a half over the
Bay Cltyite.
Token- altogether It waa a very satis
factory contest, practically devoid of ac
cident, and the best team won. A pleas
ing feature of the day's , sport wan . evi
denced when the Bay Citys and Olympics,
who have long been sworn enemies,
cheered each otner after the finish, and
the member* of, the two clubs hobnobbed
nt lunch- and on the road coming home.
This good < feeling will probably be fur
ther cemented at the Joint run of the two
clubs to Mission San Jose next Sunday.

MURPHY IN

A BALL BAT

PACE'S OBJECTION THE CAUSE

The San Franciscos Grave a miserable
Display That Thoy Claimed
Was the Great National
â¢â  Game.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Mr. Murphy, leader and captain of that*
collection of "bandbox" ball tossers
known as the San Francisco Club, dis
tinguished himself In a moet disagree
able manner yesterday afternoon at
Recreation Park by deliberately throwing
one of the Stockton club's bats over the
grand stand.
Never in the history of the great na
tional game has such an exhibition oc
curred, and, to the eyes of those who ad
mlrÂ« the genteel player, this hasty action
of Murphy's will long be remembered
and deplored.
It happened toward the latter part of
a badly played game, in which Murphy's
cohorts gave another one of their mis
erable exhibitions. While at the plate.
Murphy conceived the singular idea that
a change of bats was necessary to se
cnre a base hit, and thereupon went to
the Stockton bench and helped himself.
There was nothing unusual about this
proceeding, as players very often do this
sort of thing. Pace, however, objected to
Murphy using the Stockton bats, and
while he was Justified in doing so. It was
nevertheless very small of him, but as
he persisted, after some debate. In which
the umpire took a hand. Murphy took the
bat and threw it clear over the grand
stand Into the street. It was an un
called for display of temper and hisses,
hoots and jeers were freely bestowed.
All through the game these hisses and
Jeers continued, ceasing only at the ex
piration of the contest. Murphy for his
stupid action was suspended for thirty
days.
The Stocktons were easy winners, the
score being- as follows:

THE " BABIES " TBIUMPH.
They Finally Defeat the Hard-
Hitting Oakland Club.
WATSONVIL.LE, Sept. 18.â The "ba
bies" succeeded to-day In winning their
I first league game. Their opponents were
the hard-hitting Oaklands. The score at
I the end of the game was 3 to 1 In favor of
! Watsonvllle, and they did not pluy the
\ last half of the ninth. The on* run made
by Oakland wan In the fourth Inning. Two
' men were out when a fair ball wm batted
along the third-base line and hit Dono
j van who, after attempting to make home,
was returning to third. Umpire Smith
declared Donovan vntr. which in clearly
:in violation of the rules. Donovan after
ward came home and made the only tally
; for Oakland. Umpire Smith's Judgment
i of balls and strikes wan very deficient,
: anfl was unjust to both Ditchers. He fa
vored neither side, but a baaeboll audience
wants to see both pitchers In a game get
a fair deal from the umpire.
The Watsonville batteryâ Hartman and
j Donlinâ put up a great gameâ one that
I suited the spectators to a dot. The local
; baseball patrons feel very Jubilant over the
victory of the home team, and think that
the "hoodoo," which has been with the
"Babies" since ther entrance into the
league, has been put to sleep for all time.

team to-day by a score of 3 to 1 in one of

BISHOP HURST'S
WORDS OF WISDOM
Eloquent Talk at the
Conference.
GENEROUS TO THE PAGANS
GIVES CBEDIT TO THOSE WHO
SEEK THE TRUTH.
Bey. F. C. Lee of Beno, Nev., Slated
for the Pastorate of the Califor
nia-Street Church in San
Francisco.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE, Sept. IS.â the con
ference of Methodist ministers draws
nearer its close Its members are growing j
the more eager to learn in what lines j
their lot is to be cast for the coming year, |
and this eagerness is the harder to re- j
press since, it has become known that I
practically; all < the appointments have
been decided upon already. No one knows
positively what these appointments are j
to be except the Bishop and the presiding j
elders, and they guard their secret with
Jealous care. It really seems that they
enjoy giving their ministerial brethren
this season of painful anxiety, for with
the . tact of trained diplomatists they
parry or evade all leading questions
arong this line. .About the only change
that is positively known to the conference
at large is that -Rev. F.C. .Lee of Reno.
New, is to have the pastorate of the Cal
ifornia street Church in San Francisco.
Dr. Lee stands very high in Methodism,
and the conference is congratulating it
self upon so valuable an acquisition to Its
membership. . '
Conference business was, of course, sus
pended for to-day, but much was done
to celebrate that day of days to Metho-
Conference Sunday. The exercises
began at 9 o'clock this morning and con
tinued with scarcely a break until after
10 o'clock to-night.
The first event was the annual confer
ence "Love Feast," so dear to the heart
of the preacher, which was led by Rev.
H. B. Heacock, D.D., of Santa Clara. This
service fittingly led up to the conference
sermon at 11 o clock, which was preached
by the Right Rev. Bishop John Fletcher
Hurst, D.D., L.L.D.. of Washington, D. C,
the presiding officer of this conference.
An audience that filled the main audito
rium of the M. E. church and its two !
large annexes and then stood in aisles j
and along the walls greeted this eminent
man when he arose to speak, Notwith
standing the immense crowd and, the dis
comfort in the position of many not a
sound was. to be heard throughout the
bundling but the resonant i voice of the
Bishop and an occasional fervent Metho
dist "Amen" from one of his hearers.
Taking Acts xvii:27. "That they should
seek the Lord. If haply they might feel
after him, and find him. though he be not
far from every one of us," as his text,
the eminent divine talked of the worlds
great search for truth and perfection,
speaking in effect as follows:
There is no more fitting illustration of the
sublime in all history than Paul on Mars Hill,
for it Is the event in which Is found the cul
minating division between Paganism and
Christianity, from which have Issued streams
that are still flowing around the world. It
had Ions: been the custom of learned men to
come to Athens, the seat of all learning of that
age. Paul had been there often before, and
wise men hod heard of him and his new
teachings. They sent for him and were fas
cinated by his subtle speech. They took him
up to the Areopagus that he might â â  there in
the presence of supreme Judges enunciate his
new doctrine that "all men are one In Christ. ...
and â  that thÂ« .world had always been , seeking;
Christ, who was truth. . _/ â¢ ...
1 As Paul stood there, surrounded by all the
glories and wonders of Athens, he was not
effected by the great events of History they
represented, but continued to declare unity
of race and unttv Of savior. All men had
sought truth. Much of the history of human
ity can be found in these wild wanderings
after truth, all of which should command our
respect, whether they be those of Paganism
and idolatry or those of later and better men,
like Mohammed. The world had been led to
regard Mohammed in better light than as an
Impostor, for with all his ethical faults, his
sins against morality, his superstitions be
queathed to heirs of his beliefs, he was the
first man to abandon Idolatry, the first to be
convinced of the existence of one God only
and to teach such conviction.
The same truth may apply to other Pagan
faiths, and there are points to be conmended
in Buddhism, the faith of Zoroaster and
others, for their founders were true, following
the bfÃt light they knew, struggling: with all
their powers after the real truth, and. Just as
a pearl diver groping in ocean depths for price
less pearl reaches and hopes for the best, and
on coming again to the surface may find his
hands Mil of wind and worth ess ;weeds . If
they have failed to fin.l the pearl of truth they
should not be blamed for what they could not
lAs we read of the search of Pagan minds for
the truth we come upon such examples as
Aristotle and Plato. Plato came very near
the truth in his remarkable doctrine that God
could come down to men and men rise up to
God. a doctrine that was a scintillation from
the cross that was to be and for which think
ers of the middle ages called him the fifth
evangelist. There is. however, no part of the
Christian Bible that does not eclipse the great
est â¢ thought of Pagan minds, for all of It I*
true. Recent archaeological and other scien
tific research has proved It so clearly that even
Infidel minds must acknowledge It, that thÂ»
Bible Is no mythological story. .
Among the most recent discoveries confirming
Bible history Is that of some of the treasure,
chambers In which Joseph stored corn against
the coming of Egypt's great famine.. There Is ,
not a single part of the New Testament bin
has been confirmed by tablets of stone or
papyrus documents.' . .\,. I
Another object of the world's great search |
la the perfect character, and reviewing all the
world's immortals we find not one without a ]
blemish until we come to the man of Naza- ,
reth lie wan a perfect character, the . first j
great answer to the world's search for truth,
in whose career there is not one word or deed
that might be other than it was. In describ
ing this wonderful character four gospels sup
plement each other. Matthew was commissioned
to paint a picture. : Mark â¢ looked ot the com- j
pleted portrait and saw; points yet unfinished ;
and he added bits of color here and there, em
phasizing Matthew's work. Luke, more minute,
filled In details, supplying action and new ef
fects: while John glorified the whole with j
something of the divine.
At 2 p. m. ordination services were con
ducted by Bishop Hurst, assisted by
Bishop "W. M. Taylor, Rev. Drs. W. S.
Urmy, W. 8. Matthew, O. P. Mains, S. G.
Gale! E. E. Dodge, A. H. Need ham. E. R.
Dille, J. A. B. Wilson and J. N. Beard.
Dr. Needham presented on behalf of the
conference Edward H. Mackay, Fay
Donaldson and Edward L. Snowdon. !
candidates for deacons 1 orders. These j
men took their solemn vows according to j
the MethodiÃt Episcopal church ritual i
and the Bishop, placing his hands on the ;
heads of each, gave them authority to j
"perform the office of deacon in the !
church of God and to read the Holy
Scriptures in the church of God and teach !
and preach the same."
Dr. Needham then presented Leslie M.
Burwell, Frank Hindson, William A.
Kennedy and William Marshall, men who
had completed four years of probation
and were now candidates for full and
final orders as elders of the Methodist I
church. These youn* men took more
solemn and more binding vows than those
taken by the deacons, and were ordained
and consecrated by the imposition of the I
hands of Bishop Hurst and seven other ,
fathers in the church and grlven authority |
to administer the sacraments of the
church.
Then In behalf of the conference and
Methodist church throughout the world
the Bishop gave them the brotherly hand.
The service was Impressive.
Two deaconesses. Misses Holbrook an<f
Harvey, were presented for consecratior.
and at the conclusion of this ceremony
the conference, kneeling, sang "Take my
life and let it be consecrated. Lord, to
thee."
At the 6 p. m. conference the Epworth
League anniversary was celebrated. Rev.
E. P. Dennett, president of the California
Epworth league, presided, introducing
aa speakers of the evening Rev. Dr.
Jesse L. Hurlbut, secretary of the Ameri
can Methodist Sunday-school Union, and
Rev. Dr. George P. Mains of New York.
To-day's programme included another
anniversary celebration, that of the Con
ference Missionary Society , its president.
Rev. Dr. F. J. Masters, presiding and an
persons participating in the evening's ex
ercises being in some way connected with
missionary work. Dr* Masters was for
many years a missionary In China; Dr.
Evans, who read the Scriptures, had
lately returned from mission work In
Mexico, and Rev. Dr. A. J. Palmer of
New York, who delivered the main ad
dress of the evening, Is secretary of the
American Methodist Missionary Society.
Mrs. Thomas Hodge of San Francisco
sang the offertory, "Jerusalem." Miss
Nellie Rodgers of College Park rendered
beautifully "O rest In the Lord."
Dr. Palmer's theme was "Mission Work
as Carried on by the Methodist Episcopal
Church." He first outlined the work from
a business or financial standpoint, show
ing how all legal and financial questions
were submitted to a committee of trained
and successful business men. Enlarging
upon this, he declared that the work of
16.000 Methodist ministers who were giv
ing their services gratuitously in collect-
Ing missionary money was the secret of
the phenomenal success of the great work
of the society which he represented.
YOUNG BLOOD TELLS

A. BREUSS APPEARS AS A NEW
CRACK SHOT.
Makes a Score of Sixty-Nine Points
and Surprises Old-Timers â An
Off Day at Shell Mound.
As time flies the older marksmen of the
various shooting organizations find that
despite their best efforts hands will trem
ble and the sight of a rifle describe trape
zolds and parabolas In the air, while the
younger men begin to emerge from the
chrysalis stage and make their presence
felt. This fact was well Illustrated at
Schuetzen Park yesterday, when A.
Breuss of the California Schuetzen Club
sont bullets into a target to a 69-polnt
tune. This is the best score made for a
long time, and Breu6s will hereafter be
reckoned among the greater lights.
T*ie Vereln Elntracht Shooting Section
held Its monthly bullseye shoot as well
as the California Schuetzen Club. O. Mul
ler, R. Stettin and Louts Schmidt made
dead centers of twenty-five points. When
measured by the instruments Muller's
shot was found to be a fraction the best.
The scores of the California Schuetzen
Club in detail were as follows:
O. Breuss 69, C. Kffing 203, J. Utschlg Sr. 259,
J. C. Wolden 288, C. J. Waller Â»6, J. F. Rob

Rifle at Shell Mound.
It was expected that Beveral of the
shooting clubs would be on the Shell
Mound rifle range yesterday, but the
markers were disappointed, and it was
decidedly an off day. A few of the mem
bers of the Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club
were at practice for the coming revolver
match with the Brooklyn Revolver Club,
but thf>y had no scores for publication.

LOUIS MOHLFELBT DEOWNED.
The Body of the Teamster Found
Washed Up on the Beach.
OAKLAND.. CaI., Sept. 18-The body of
Louis Mohlfeldt, a teamster residing in
Ban Francisco, was found washed up on
the rocks of the restraining wall, near the
narrow-gauge mole about 5 o'clock this
morning. The body was found by a boat
man named Josephs. It had been in the
water several days. Coroner Baldwin
took charge of the remains. An Inquest
â will be held to-morrow night.
Death From Diphtheria.
nERKELET, Sept. 18.â Frit* Joenlchs.
the nine-year-old son of Carl Joenlchs of
V>'<-Ht Berkeley, died early this morning
â "rioer circumstances which leave the
. uho of death uncertain. The house In
which the family lives Is on University
ie, near Ban Pablo avenue, and lies
v.ithfn the region where diphtheria has
tJton prevalent lately. Some time ago thÂ«
child contracted the disease, and Dr.
J ityne was called in. But for two weeks
hÂ»- has been considered free from all dan
ger. This morning, however, he passed
away suddenly. Dr. A.- de Marcennay. on
being called, reported the case to the Cor
oner, who has ordered an- autopsy to-be
held.
Lived in Alameda.
ALAMEDA, Sept. IS.â Oliver Young, the
baggageman who was murdered at Pen
dleton. Or., yesterday, was formerly a
resident of this city, where he lived up to
about three and a half years ago, -when
he went to Oregon to take a position on
a railroad. He was a plumber by trade,
and had many ' friends here, "being a
steady and well respected man. His
brother, Edgar Young, lives here, and la
a carpenter and builder.
Burned With Gasoline.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 18.â E. B. Owens, a
plumber doing business at 1442 Webster
street, was painfully burned about the
face yesterday afternoon by the explosion
of a heater in which gasoline was used
for fuel. The machine did not work and
Owens was examining it, when it blew
up.
ATE POISONED ICE CBEAM.
Mary McGuire the Victim â Swim
ming Contests at Sutro's
Baths.
The park police were led to believe yes
terday that they had a case on their
hands that was rivaled only by the
Delaware poisoning mystery. Miss Mary
McGuire of 513 Hayes street, whfte en
joying herself strolling though the city's
playground, was taken suddenly ill and
was removed by Home friends to the
Emergency Hospital. The young woman
was apparently suffering from the effects
of some mineral poison. Her suffering
was intense, and for a time the physi
cians who labored over her were not
over-confident that the sufferer would re
cover. Finally, however, the remedies
administered had the proper effect and
the patient rallied. She stated that she
had partaken heartily of ice-cream in a
downtown establishment and was taken
ill not long after leaving the place. She
went to the park thinking that the pain
she was suffering would soon' pass away,
but she was mistaken. The physicians
are of the opinion that the ice-cream was
allowed to stand too long in the can in
which it was made and thereby became
poisoned. As soon as the police heard the
young woman's stoTy they were greatly
relieved, as it would go hard with the
officer who unfortunately dug up another
mystery for Lees to solve at the present
time.
Thousands of pleasure-seekers spent an
enjoyable day at 1 the park and cliff.
Sutro's Baths also provided entertain
ment for a multitude of lovers of aquatjc
sports. Sid Cavill again defeated Dan
Green. The two champions ewam a race
of 440 yards. Cavill got a start of about
six feet and at the line marking the end
of the swim he had not gained a foot.
Green's feat of pressing the Australian
so closely caused considerable excitement,
and many who witnessed the match are
confident that with an even start the local
man can defeat Cavill. They are willing
to back him if another match fs arranged.
George Kroug won the 60-yard dash,
Ralph Simpson second. The under-water
swimming contest was won by A- J.
Baker, James Jackson second. R. D. Cor
nell won the obstacle race, A. J. Baker
second. Otto Schulte won the prize in the
springboard diving and Fred Green was
declared victor in the trick and fancy
trapeze diving.
WILL MUSTER IN A
NEW REGIMENT
THE GLORIOUS FIRST TO BE
REHABILITATED.
Work to Begin at Onee â The Organi
sation to Be Carefully Perfected
and Maintained Ready for
Service.
The Governor and the adjutant general
of the National Guard of California have
decided upon- the immediate jrehAbllita
tion of the First Regiment of this State.
This will be acomplished under the pro
visions of section ISSI of the military code,
and, what 1b more to the point, without
entailing expense to the taxpayers.
The section referred to provides In
substance that any persons may petition
the State authorities ior permission to
form a military company to be known as
! such a company (designating it by the
name or title selected) and asking that
I It be assigned to whatever regiment the
! board of location may direct. This
i board consists of the Governor, the ad
jutant general and the major general
commanding the division.
By reason of the decision of the ad
jutant general arrived at yesterday It is
presumed that petitions will be received
i at once, as It 1b known that in this city
j there are several officers of the First
Refrlment, men who were unable to go
I to Manila, who have more than a hundred
: names on each of their lists for the or
1 sanitation of such companies. As soon
I as these petitions are received by the ad
jutant general, that officer and the Gov.
: ernor will order the commander of the
, brigade In whlcn the signers are located
* to detail proper officers to Inspect the
! men as to their qualifications ana to have
them examined by a medical board.
1 They will then be directed to proceed
with the election of their company of-
I flcera. and the regimental staff will be
I completed In the same manner. By this
i means the new regiment will be In proper
condition to respond to a call, prepared
for any emergency, either for home or
j foreign service.
NEW BILL AT
THE ALHAMBRA.
Mile. Fassi, described as the "great
Russian electro terpslchorienne," 1b one
of the special stars who will twinkle In
the new bill at the Alhambra next week.
Mile. Fassi executes a series of Illum
inated dances that are said to have given
great delight to the nobility in St. Peters
burg:, Moscow, Paris, Berlin and London.
A startling trapeze act will be divulged
by the flying Austins, and Mr. and Mrs.
Drew will appear in a new piece entitled
"Diana on the Cnose." This latter ttcl,
says the London Era, is another variant
of the Btatue-come-to-life motive, re
minding the constant playgoer of Nlobe.
Mr. DreWs part Is to imagine that his
statue comes to life, claims him as hus
band and bids him leave his superfluous
wltfe. Drew and his dashing colleague are
said to get lots of good fun out of the
piece. There are other changes in the bill
and several of the old favorites are re
tained.

WHY INDEPENDENTS ARISE
TWO VIEWS OF JOHDAN'S CHAB
ACTEB.
Judge Magnire Uttered Some Truth.
When He Addressed His Sec
tional Audience Last
Friday.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 18.
There is more than an Indication â there
is an apparent probabilityâ that the Re
publican County convention will, to-mor
ro-w, follow the example of the ostrich,
and, hiding Its head behind the fcreen of
its desires, attempt to arguÂ© with itself
that what it refuses to see does not exist.
No county convention has ever met in
Alameda with more responsibility, with a
higher duty to perform, or surrounded by
more unpleasant environments than that
which will meet at San Leandro to-mor
row. The fate of Henry Gageâ if Ala
meda again is to be the pivotal county in
the State â depends on to-morrow's work.
The fate of George C. Pardee In his
march to the governorship, begun so aus
piciously, will also be decided by the
delegates to-morrow.
This year more than all other years
the State will watch Alameda County
critically, to note if her protestations of
party sincerity and harmony made at
Sacramento be bubbles or material. Al
ready there are indications that a few
eelflsh, unprincipled politicians are again
laying the foundation for the ruin of the
party as they have so often' done in the
past. Unless Eome definite changes be
made, men will be nominated to-morrow
whom even the party managers admit
cannot be elected.
This condition 1b being eagerly watch
ed by a great number of independent.
Democratic and fusion candidates, who
are doing their best to disrupt the Re
publican organization, and apparently
with some success. It Is realized more
clearly than ever that until there be a
capable primary law no proper represen
tation or the party's choice can be had
in the matter of electing delegates to a
county convention, and it is this knowl
edge that is yearly increasing the desire
of men to make independent campaigns.
There Is great encouragement offered by
past experience to men who, if honorable,
run independently of their party ticket,
and their ultimate careers . have proved
that the voters rather regard such actions
as worthy of- -'reward -for daring to brave
and overcome the ~,. party .'" machinery
rather than of censure for being a bolter.
Some" years ago Dr.' Pardee," realizing
that It would be folly to attempt to do
anything with the influences that com
bined to use â  the Republican party for
selfish purposes, started out Independent
ly, fought the railroad and the manipu
lators tooth 'and nail, and when he had
demonstrated '".that V.thÂ» * could "Vanquish
thfcm -at every turn the,?", acknowledged'
him as the leader and made frantic ef
forts to get Into the band-wagon. After
Dr. Pardee came Henry Dalton. : He fol
lowed the leader's cue, .â¢â  ran indepen
dently, was successful, beat the railroad,
and now politically can have anything he
wants. Another example of this same
politics was Senator EarL Six years ago
Earl braved the powers that then were
in his fight for State Senator. His war
cry was "Down with De Young for the
United States Senate." and he won in a
walkover, although the railroad Influence
was organized against him.' After a few
years each of these men became recog
nized, not as bolters, but as reformers,
and the seal of public aproval was placed
upon their acts. This idea which they
followed out is* now being debased, and
men who have been prominent in helping
to bring about party corruption are now
following' the "independent" example
with but poor chances of success.
On the eve of the primaries four years
ago exactly the same conditions pre
vailed as now. Some programmes had
been prepared, which It was the Inten
tion of the manipulators to force through
the convention. Counsel was thrown to
the wind, the obnoxious Bchemers pre
vailed, and in November this great Re
publican county was disgraced. The only
offices having any patronage were lost
to Republicans because of Belflshness and
Indecency practiced by those who pro
fessed to be faithful party leaders.
Should this fatal mistake be made to
morrow there will be lust as decided a
rejection of the unworthy portion of the
ticket next November as there was in
1894.
There Is a lesson to be learned from the
primary held yesterday in the Seventh
Ward. It was clearly demonstrated that
when a grievance is believed to exist,
either rightly or wrongly, â  the afleged
cause of it must suffer. It will probably
be found eventually that Mr. Jordan is
entirely innocent of any intention or ef
fort at the Congressional primary to
help the chances of one man more than
another, but it is very evident that at
thiÃ time his home ward is Just equally
divided on the question. This presents a
proposition which cannot fall to have an
effect on the election. One-half of the
great Seventh Ward, containing over 2000
votes plainly said yesterday that they
believed Mr. Hilborn did not have a
square deal, and this condition of mind
must be reversed before November or the
result will bo even more painfully ap
parent.
To my mind there Is not any reliable
foundation for this unreasonable opposi
tion to Mr. Jordan. It is true that the
Hilborn men have produced suspicious
certificates containing the stamp of the
Clerk's office and also an alleged signa
ture of one of his deputic-s. These signa
tures have been declared by an expert to
be forgeries, but â and it is not surpris
ingâthe people of the Seventh Ward do
not pin their faith to expert testimony.
It would perhaps have' been better had
Mr. Jordan kept his hands out of politics
since he was elected, but it is not always
possible for an official to do this. It is
true he has been in nearly every political
fight, city, county or State, since he be
came County Clerk, and even his best
friends admit that this policy, though
perhaps of use to his favorites, must of
necessity make political enemies. Mr.
Metcalf had an abundance of clever and
acute political managers without Mr.
Jordan. Dr. Pardee could have won his
great primary victory In this county with
out the help of Mr. Jordan. City At
torney Dow, whose campaign was in re
ality made by Dr. Pardee, could have
been elected City Attorney without the
help of Mr Jordan. Many other political
.victories could have been won had Mr
Jordan not left his office. In each of
these cases Mr. Jordan has- been alleged
to have done something which his politi
cal enemies declare to have been Im
politic if not positively uncalled for and
wrong. This anxiety to help hla friends
is the sum â of Frank Jordan's alleged
delinquencies.
On the other hand, for four years Mr.
Jordan hits given Alan-red a County an
administration of which no man need be
ashamed. His office would* serve as a
model for every County Clerk's office In
the State. On no occasion has business
been neglected or has It been charged
that Mr. Jordan's expenditure of county
money has been extravagant. His depu
ties have all been gentlemen and business
has always been carried on with accuracy
and expedition. The system that is in
evidence from one end of the office to the
other makes it a positive pleasure to have
business In the County Clerk's office.
Men of all political and religious, creeds
have testified that Jordan Is a manager
of the most up-to-date type. The records
of the office were never oomplete until
Mr. Jordan took them in hand anu
brought order out of tons and tons of
documentary chaos. His great registers
have been faultless and this in spite of
the fact that the last Legislature made
it impossible for him to receive any extra
appropriation to accomplish such a big
task.
Jordan is always willing to put himself
to inconvenience to serve others in his
official capacity. His conduct as clerk
of the Board of Supervisors has on more
than one occasion caused that body to
commend his work, and when the reck
lessness, carelessness and wanton ex
travagance of past administrations In the
County Clerk's office are taken into con
sideration there would seem to be no
valid argument why Frank Jordan, if
nominated to-morrow, should not be
elected. These are the two sides of Mr.
Jordan's character which are before the
voters and the result will be watched
with Interest.
Judge Maguire has been in Oakland and
gone. Two years ago he was in Oakland
and went. On the former occasion ne
attempted to- impress a vast audience
with the fact that free silver was an ai
tar and Bryan a god which innocent Oak
landers would do well to worship. Tom
Reed came later and spoke at the 1 race
track for half an hour. Each of his
minutes helped to produce a majority of
200 sound money votes. Mr. Maguire
spoke for over an hour at the Macdon
ough Theater and
General Barnes will be in Oakland be
fore many weeks, and people are wonder
ing what will be the effect of his speecn
over the egotistical tirade delivered by
the man or many political colors last
Friday evening.
Oakland has never seen such a meeting
as the one in which Mr. Maguire was the
leading figure. It was truly a remark
able meeting. Everybody was uncom
fortable on the platform and off. It is
a very hard thing to talk on definite Is
sues to which such conflicting elements
are listening as Cleveland Democrats and
rabid Populists, and preserve the peace.
Mr. Magulre's speech was a failure in
that he avoided everything that would
enlighten his audience regarding his
Ideas on the "Issues" of the Joint parties.
It was a success in that he said nothing
to hurt anybody's feelings or to causa
anybody to feel elated. The Judge talked
about himself, the railroad company and
recited a chapter from the Congressional
Record and occasionally, with perfect
safety, referred to Thomas Jefferson and
Abraham Lincoln. These two last "ideas"
and "issues" were all that could Induce
more than a fifth of the conglomerate
audience, to cheer at one time.
The paragraph in Mr. Maguire's speech
that impressed me moat with its truth
fulness was this: "There have been in
the history' of the world, the history of
civilizationâ l think it came In with civ
ilizationâPharisees; Pharisees who have
always been going about saying In one
form or another 'I am holler than thou 1 ".
Somehow or other, this particular phrase
is missing from the stenographic report
of the meeting In Mr. Maguire's organ.

WHILE HE WON
A FORTUNE HE
LOST A BRIDE
The Sad Experience of
Francois Pigon.
CUPID WAS AGAINST HIM
LOVE WAS OUTWITTED BY VERY
CRUEL FATE.
A Young Klondiker Comes to Claim
His Sweetheart and A'inds Hex
in Bridal Array, Celebrat
ing Her Wedding.
The old saw that truth Is stranger than
ficuon and that the course of true love
is a rocky road to travel has been re
markably demonstrated in two young
people of San Francisco, and the strange
imaginary pictures of life as shown on
the stage of Morosco's have been cast
in the shade by the actual occurrences in
their lives.
About five years ago Francois Pigon,
a young man of good family, fell, at first
slgnt, "heels over head" In love with Vir
ginia Reiftel, one of the handsomest and
most charming young ladies of the
French colony. His affection was recip
rocated and their future was painted In
glowing colors. However, stern parents
had something to say regarding the
mutch. Francois had not reached his ma
jority and while he had been reared in
luxury and idleness and had no concep
tion of the meaning of the word "labor,"
he was not the possessor of a self-sup
porting position or a bank account. For
this reason his parents objected to his as
suming the responsibilities of a benedict.
The sire of the young lady also constituted
himself a stumbling block to the ambition
of the young man, and declared that until
sich time as he had established
In life and showed that he was competent
to provide for a wife he should net wed
the oeautifui Virginia.
The lady could not or would not disre
gard .c wishes of her parents and there
was a tearful parting of the lovers.
However, the young man who had
known nothing l>ut the kid-glove and the
pate-de-tois-gras side of lite, was deter
mined to win the girl, and he lost no time
in preparing to go out and do the battle
01 nis lite.
He declared his intentions, asked Miss
Virginia to wait lor him, and her promise
was given. Then, in company witn an
old experienced miner, he sailed for the
inhospitable shores of Alaska.
There the soit-lianded swain went up
against the seamy side of life, and stood
the teat when the hardships of the miner
in the dreadful northlano. were much
more severe than tney are now. He was
with the advance guard of prosepctors.
and proved himselt not only strong but
fearless in t c face of the sore trials that
come to the peonle who tempt Providence
in that back-door yard of the North Pole.
Through all his eftorts and privations the
love of a lovable wo.man sustained him.
Francois was in the advance when the
discovery was made in the Klondike, and
was one of the nrst to rush to that land
of gold. Fortune favored him and when
the turmoil had subsided he was the pos
sessor of two among the best of mines on
Bonanza Creek, bor a youngster little
past his majority this was marvelous good
luck and he then felt assured that he had
won the prize he had so faithfully striven
for.
As opportunity afforded he sent letters
to his sweetheart and parents, but while
fate safely delivered the latter missives
Cupid made it his business to see that
the former miscarried. For some reason
not dirficult to explain the messages sent
to the young lady, through his parents,
v.ere not delivered and while he supposed
he was encouraging his prosective wife
with uUes of untolu wealth, she was ig
norant of 'his subcess or failure, and fin
ally concluding that her young lover had
forgot a passing fancy and would not re
turn to fuiiiii his fervid vow, she listened
to the advice of friends and parents and
wedded another, mayhap to lead a life of
unalloyed happiness.
Here is where the trusting lover comes
on the scene; comes with enthusiasm;
comes with fat sacks of nuggetsâ with
checks and drafts to burn â comes as an
other Croesusâ a king of gold from tho
Klondike.
Francois, believing that his loved one
was conversant with his successes
through the medium of his letters, and
that he would be accorded a proper wel
come and thereafter take unto himself
a wife whose love would richly recom
pense him for all the sorrows he had ex
perlenced, prepared a pleasant surprise
lor all concerned.
Fate, however, disposed matters other
wise, and thereby hangs a tale that
â¢would be hard to duplicate in fiction.
lie had "sailed the seas over" and
"crowed the wide ocean" to claim his
bride and shower his wealth upon her.
He arrived in San Francisco two weeks
ago yesterday, laden with sacks of gold
galore, and without a word to his rela
tives went to a hotel to prepare the long
intended surprise. A short seance with a
barber and bootblack, a brushing up of
his rough miner's garb, and the young
man felt confident that he was prepared
for the most enjoyable event in his life
time.
Accompanied by his business partner
he proceeded to the home of i4lss Reiffel,
prepared to take hfr to his arms and de
mand the fulfillment of the promise made
to him by the girl's father.
The hack that carried the expectant
lover could not travel fast enough to suit
him, but his haste was of no avail. While
he was dallying with the tonsorial artist
and the polisher of shoes the apple of his
eye was before the chancel in the Church
of Notre Dame dcs Victotres, taking the
vows that made her the wife of Francois.'
unknown rival.
About three minutes after the bridal
party arrived at the home of the bride's
parents the hot-footed young Klondiker
appeared on the scene. He was ushered
into the Â«ialn parlor by a sister of the
bride without being prepared for the
shook that awaited him. His former
sweetheart, then in the lower parlor be
ing congratulated as "Mrs. Marion Ma
gallon." was notified that Francois was
iiw.-iltlng her. She received the announce
ment calmly and walked up the stairway
amid a shower of rice and followed by
jpsts and laughter.
Arriving at the landing she obtained a
gllmpeo of the bronzed and weather-worn
man to whom her first love had been
pledged. Without a word she promptly
fainted and was unconscious for nearly a.
half hour.
The faithful Francois seeing that the
prize he had po bravely battled for was
lost collapsed without speaking a word,
and in a dazed condition was assisted to
a carriage by his friend.
The wedding festivities were suspended
for a time, but the pride of the bride
finally sustained her and at the feast she
was the gayest of the gathering, while
her former lover was struggling with his
disappointment at his hotel.
The wealthy young Pigon is naturally
disgusted with his reception, and sighs
no more for the joys of wedded life He
will return to his mines In February and
remain there till he has obtained all the
gold the Klondike has In store for him
So endeth a story of love's labor lost!
Knights of Tara's Outing.
The fourth annual reunion and picnic of
the Knights of Tara was held at Shell
Mound Park yesterday. There was a large
attendance of the members and their
friends. Aside from the dancing, regular
and fancy, there were a number of races
In the amphitheater, the prizes for the
winners being liberal and numerous.
Many prizes were also given out to those

TRIBUTE TO BISMARCK'S MEMORY
The Loyal Germans of the City Fittingly Honor the
Name of the Iron Chancellor. â¢
IN the city by the Golden Gate muf
fled drums rolled a requiem to the Iron
Chancellor yesterday, while thousands
of Gorman-Americansâ loyal citizens of
their adopted country, but tilled with love
for the master hand that cemented the
score of independent States into the one
great empire that to them is Fatherland
paid grateful tribute to his memory-
Metropolitan Hall was filled when Wag
ner's march from "Parsifal" announced
the opening of the Bismarck memorial
services. The hall was tastefully draped
with mourning emblems and palms, while
a heroic bust of Germany's foremost
statesman occupied the post of honor on
the rostrum. Just before the exercises
began the Krieger Verein in uniform, un
der command of Captain Robert Wieneke,
filed on to the stage with muffled drums
rolling a dirge and the American flag
draped in crape.
At the conclusion of the opening selec
tion Dr. C. M. Richter, the president of
the day, dejivered his address, during
which he said:
"We estimate the greatness of a man by the
results which his life has produced. We call
his memory great, when he has succeeded lii
glorifying his fellow men and people. All
mankind Is Interested In honoring and com
memorating the memory of such a man. Th*

great deeds of the Emperor William, the se

WILL CONVENE
THE GRAND JURY
A DELAWARE INDICTMENT FOR
MRS. BOTKIN.
Governor Budd's Decision Drives the
Eastern Authorities to Their
Law Books, and They Pro
pose to Fight.
Because Governor Budd has positively
declined to become a party to the kid
naping of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin into* the
State of Delawcire has set the Governor
and law servers of that State sadly by
the ears, and, while they have all gone
hard at work seeking out precedents and
some way out of their dilemma, they are
filling in their spare moments by saying
sarcastic things about his Excellency or
the State of California.
The first news received by the Dela
ware authorities of Governor Budd's de
cision to not further consider Governor
Tunnell's requisition until a proper com
plaint should accompany It, waa through
a characteristically unique Lees tele
gram. It amounted to a reiteration of
the Chief's ambiguous injunction of two
weeks ago: "If you have not got enough
evidence go out and get more," and was
accompanied by a suggestion to substi
tute for the faulty warrant an indictment
by the Delaware Grand Jury.
Upon reading it Governor Tunnel im
meaiately wired back for definite infor
mation. Pursuant to Chief Lees' sugges
tion that an indictment would be more
readily considered by Governor Budd
than either an information or complaint
the Delaware authorities are arranging
to call a special session of the Grand
Jury at Wilmington.
In a telegram received last evening
from Wilmington, it is said that efforts
are being made to get the jury together
to meet at some day to be set during the
next two weeks, although the regular
session does not come on until November,
and that every effort and influence will
be exerted to get Mrs. Botkin into the
Delaware jurisdiction for trial.
In an interview with The Call's Dela
ware correspondent, Secretary of State
Hughes takes occasion to criticize Gov
ernor Budd's knowledge of the law regu
lating extradition. He said: "We have
honored a great number of extnulitions
in this department within my experience,
but the most complete contained nothing
more thaji the second installment of papers
which we prepared for Governor Buda.
So far as averring that Mrs. Deane was
a human being, as required by Governor
Budd, the indictment will, of course, set
forth everything under the sun and in
exhaustive phraseology. That Mrs.
Deane, the senior of the two murdered
women, came to a horrible death by poi
soned candy sent to her through the
malls, and that she certainly was a hu
man being of this State."
Chief Lees stated yesterday that he had
discovered an opinion that Governor
Budd, nor any other Governor, could do
nothing else than grant extradition when
requested to. "Governor Budd," said
Chief Lees, "cannot refuse to grant this
warrant. If he does his action is arbi
trary and he can be compelled to act by
the Supreme Court. I will not say that
we will resort to the Supreme Court, but
I want to tell you that I have started
In on this thing and I am not going to
be bluffed out. If there Is a law in the
land to do it I am going to get this
â¢woman back to Delaware for trial."
This morning Judge Cook will hear an
application for a writ or habeas corpus
on behalf of the prisoner.
He Came From Marysville.
Frank Goss. an unsophisticated yoting
man from Marysville, got into the Dewey
saloon, 33 Third street, yesterday morning,
â¢where he met A. L. Dix, a member of the
Kansas regiment. They had several
drinks together and then they threw
dice with Arthur E. Hiett, the barten
drr, as to who would pay for breakfast
for the trio. Goss lost and paid $1 35 for
the breakfast. After leaving the restau
rant he became helpless, and when he re
covered his senses he was in a rear room
in the saloon with his pockets empty. He
claims to have lost over $20. Hiett and
Dlx were arrested and booked at the City
Prison on a charge of grand larceny.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1898.
believed that Germany was a young giant and
not a dying race. No one In the whole world
had thought it possible that behind German
sentimentality lay a "furor teutonicus." Every
country has its great men, representing the
most perfect crystallization of its national fea
tures, but Bismarck, who strove to perfect the
Individual of the nation, as it were, and com
pelled this perfection, remains an unusual
figure in the history of the world.
Following the president's address was a
mass chorus, "Unter alien Wlpfeln Ist
Ruh," by 200 male voices selected from
the various singing societies in this city,
under the direction of Herr Hermann
Holzhaucr, and then Professor Julius
Goebel of Leland Stanford Jr. University
delivered an oration in German, in which
he reviewed Bismarck's life work as sol
dler and statesman.
Frank G. Rohner rendered Beethoven's
"Kgmont" overture on the grand organ,
and was followed by Miss Elsa Prlber,
who recited a poem, "To Bismarck's
Memory." composed by Th. Kirchhoff.
Professor Bernard Moses of the Univer
sity of California delivered an eloquent
oration in English, picturing the dead
statesman's great work for his country
and for humanity. This was followed by
another chorus. "Osplan," after which
Wagner's grand march from "Tannhaus
er," filled the great hall.
The reading of a poem by C. Bundschu,
the tribute of the Krieger Verein and the
veterans of the German army, closed the
services, which were impressive through
out and a fitting tribute to the man whose
memory they honored.
SMALL YACHTS RACE
IN A STRONG BREEZE
WIND TOO STRONG FOR SOME OP
THE RACERS.
Merope and the Yawl With the Tan
Sails Again Prove Winners
in a Small but Fast
Fleet.
The Corinthian small-yacht regatta,
which had to be postponed on Sunday, the
11th, for lack of wind, was held yesterday
off El Campo. So far from there being
a lack of wind the breeze was so strong
and squally that the list of entries was
small.
In the 18-foot class there were four en
tries. C. Eastwood's yawl Kittiwake
proved an easy winner, T. L. Miller's
Idler being second.- Kittiwake set her
spinnaker quickly after starting, and,
gaining a good lead, kept and increased
it.
The course was from a starting line off
El Campo to Red Rock, round it and
thence back to the starting line. The
breeze being southwesterly, it was a run
to Red Rock and a beat back. Vice-
Commodore G. T. S. White of the San
Franciscos sailed one of the half-raters
belonging to the Pacific Yacht Club, but
her mafnsail being reefed and still hoisted
to the full height, and having no spin
naker, she did not run fast; and in the
beat to windward her lack of stability
told against her. In rounding Red Rock
the boats got under the lee of the rock
and so lost the wind for a minute or two.
Kittiwake was first round, and in the
beat home she stood up well, beating
Idler by 14 minutes and 35 seconds and
Dulce by a considerably greater time.
The Pacific half-rater did not finish.
In the 24-foot class P. W. Hamdall's
sloop Merope, which won in her class in
the Admission day regatta, again proved
a winner, defeating Brietzmann Bros.'
sloop Cupid by 5 minutes and 42 seconds.
Frank Bartlett's sloop Queen. E. R

GENERAL MILLER IN DOUBT.
Discredits the Prediction of an Early-
Movement of Troops.
Considerable excitement was caused
among the troops at the Presidio yester
day by the dispatch published in themorn
ing papers to the effect that the War De
partment contemplated the immediate
sending of the troops now here to Manila
and Honolulu. General Miller, when seen
yesterday in regard to the dispatches,
said:
"I have received no news from Washing
ton of any character whatsoever. I do
not beljeve that the War Department in
tends to send any troops away from San
Francisco until after the return of Gen
eral Merriam. We have had a number of
similar rumors from Washington and
there has been nothing in them, and I am
inclined to think that there is nothing in
this latest one."
Yesterday was an exceedingly quiet day
at the Presidio. First Brigade headquar
ters were closed early in the afternoon

ROCK ISLAND
BOY PROVES
A WONDER
Eastern Greyhound
Beats Firm Friend.
LEADS HIM MANY LENGTHS
LUXOR, A PUPPY FROM SANTA
CLABA, A WINNER.
High-Class Competition Marks tne
Sport at Union Coursing Park.
Many Fast Bogs at
Ingleside.
Rock Island Boy, a puppy recently Im
ported from the East, won the open stake
at Ingleside Coursing Park yesterday in
most impressive style. He met Firm
Friend, the imported English dog in the
final and did not permit him to score.
From the moment they left the slips
the Boy commenced to gain on his op
ponent and opened up a gap of fully ten
lengths. They coursed the hare straight
across the field, and after working him
for a few wrenches he escaped. The win
ner was favorite at two to one. He was
fortunate during the afternoon in work
ing his way into the final easily. Firm
Friend, on the contrary, had gruelling
courses throughout the day. This is the
winner's third start. The last time out
he won the puppy stake, and when on his
first appearance he won three courses.
Curtis & Son won the puppy stake with
Luxor, a most promising youngster. In
the final he met Trinket. He led up and
secured the turn and came around, let
ting Trinket in. Luxor then killed. The
detailed results follow:
Puppy stake, second round â T. J. Cronin'B
Rose of Tralee beat J. Segrgerson's Gold Hill;
T. J. Cronln's Maid of Bail beat Curtis & Son's
Highland Ball; M. C. Delano's Trinket beat

HADIWIST WINS.
The Winner of the Champion Stake
at Ingleside Yesterday Was a
Surprise to Everybody.
The Champion stake was won yesterday
at Ingleside Coursing Park by Hadiwist.
and the non-winners' stake went to St.
Gertrude, the runner-up in the non-win
ners' stake being Brlliahtine, who was
withdrawn by J. Dean, as the course pre
vious to the finals was very long, in
which Brilliantlne and Sir Wilful had all
the running taken out of them by a hare
that had extraordinary energy, who after
running the hounds all over the field for
several minutes gracefully made its exit
Into the escape. That Hadiwist should
win the champion stake was a surprise
to everybody was very evident, as in
every course, with one exception, he was
a good short-ender. False Flatterer had
an unlucky streak, being defeated in the
third round by a bad hare more than by
Mercury's fleetness. L. S. Conley, who
was not retired until the fifth round in
the non-winners' stake, furnished a world
of fun for the patrons of the park by his
great brain work, figuring out the direc
tion in which way the hare would run,
and by his excellent "lurching" qualities.
The day throughout was a short-enders'
day, a great many of the short-enders
winning at good, long odds.
The results were as follows:
Non-winners' stake, second round â Deckel

TALMAGE TALKS
TO TWO URGE
CONGREGATIONS
One Was an Overflow
in Union Square.
PLENTY OF ROOM IN HEAVEN
HOW TO PRAY THE SUBJECT OF
HTS ADDRESS.
"The Celestial Gates Are Open for All
Who Take the Right Road,"
Says the Eloquent
Preacher.
The announcement in the Sunday morn
ing papers that Rev. T. De Witt Talmage
â¢would preach in the evening at Calvary
Presbyterian Church, corner of Powell
and Geary streets, attracted an immense
crowd to that place of worship fully an
hour before the doors were opened.
At 7 o'clock there were over three thou
sand people gathered In the street, all of
whom were axlous to hear the eminent
divine, but considerably less than one
half were admitted. When the church was
filled to Its utmost capacity the doors
â¢were locked and the overflow remained
outside. In a few minutes, however; it
was announced to them that Mr. Talmage
would address them from the band stand
in Union square after the conclusion, of
thp church services.
Mr. Talmage took as a text for his dis
course in the church the thirteenth verse
of the twenty-fifth chapter of the First
Book ofSamuel, as follows: "And David
said unto his men) Gird ye on every man
his sword; and David also girded on his
sword: and there went up after David
four hundred men; and two hundred men
abode by the stuff."
The lesson drawn from this text was
that those who remained in camp or at
home arid did their duty are entitled to
as much credit as those who do their duty
at the front; that the man in humble sta- I
tion performing his duty faithfully is as
sure of his reward as the faithful man in
the highest and most important walks of
life. In this connection the â  eloquent
preacher raid a glowing and touching
tribute to Christian motherhood, and cited
many examples of the great good accom
plished by good mothers, whose conscfen
lious deeds have had a vast influence upon
the world.
At a few minutes after 9 o'clock Mr.
Talmage appeared upon the band stand in
Unlpn square, where he found a very
large congregation which had been pa
tiently waiting for him and meantime
singing some of the good old hymns, l
such as "Hold the Fort," "Sunshine,"
"Sweet Bye and Bye," "Rock of Ages,"
and "Pull for the Shore."
Mr. Talmage spoke for about twenty
minutes. He was sorry that so many
had been unable to get into the church, but
he consoled them with the declaration
that there is plenty of room in heaven,
the g;it.s of which will be open for all
who take the right road to get there.
"The next timt- we meet," said he, "may 1
be at the judgment seat. How are you
prospering? What are your prospects
for the life to comet" he asked, and then
he urged nil to make up their minds at
to como to God. He asked for the
blessing of God fltpon them and their
households, and hoped that hundreds of
the young men and women whom he saw
Dr. Talmage Addresses a Tremendous Overflow Meeting in Union=Square Park.
\tl lYont of him would enlist in the army
Â»*' the Lord. He called upon them to set
tle the matter in their minds then and
there. "Pray to God and say 'God be
merciful to me, a sinner,' " was the ap
peal of the preacher. "If that prayer te
too long say 'O Lord, save me,' or if you.
wish a shorter prayer say 'Help me,' or
If you wish to utter no prayer then
Mmply look up and live." He then pro-
I'ounced a touching benediction, after
which the assemblage slowly dispersed,
well pleased at having heard the fa
oious preacher If only for a few minutes.

Lieutenants D. H. Jarvis and E. P.

OLYMPICS
RECEIVE A
LUMP SUM
TheCollegesWillTake
the Receipts.
THE FOOTBALL SETTLEMENI
BOTH PARTIES ARE NOW THOR-
OUGHLY SATISFIED.
The Athletic Club and the Two
Colleges Make a Novel Agree
ment for the
Season.
The Olympic Club directors decided to
equip and support a football eleven* on
Friday morning. For over two months
the matter of putting a team in the field
which would wear the red and white of
the Olympic Club received the most care
ful attention from the officers of that
Institution, and for a time there was a
deadlock between the managers of the
college teams on one side and the direc
tors of the club on the other. An agree
ment, was reached last- week by Managers
Brown of the University of California and
Prichard of Stanford and the Olympic
Club directors by which the Olympic
Club is to receive $1500 from the colleges,
and out of that sum they guarantee to
furnish a team which will play six games,
three with each university.
There is an interesting story back of
this agreement which shows that the col
lege men did not dictate the terms this
year. At first the athletic clubs, the Re
liance of Oakland and the Olympic of this
city, came together and decided that if
either determined to organize a team the
other would not. This .agreement was
reached for self protection. The football
season is necessarily limited to the
months of October and November, and as
games can be played on Saturdays only
the schedule would also be necessarily
limited to six games, counting a Saturday
for the freshman game and the lopping
off the Saturday preceding Thanksgiving.
Were two athletic clubs to enter teams
the revenue would not be sufficient for
.either to support an eleven, and both
clubs were resolved not to organize a
team if the expense of conducting it
would not be met by the returns.
As the Olympic Club expressed a desire
to form an eleven the Reliance Club gra
ciously withdrew from the field. Then a
managerial contest was fought out, the
-details of which have never been pub
lished. The Olympic Clvjb made a stand
for the entire net revenue to be derived
from the six games which it woifld play
with the Stanford and California. To
this proposition the college managers
turned a frigid shoulder. They claimed
that it was preposterous; that all the
Olympics were really entitled to was a 60
per cent share of the net proceeds. The
Olympics manager refused to listen to
this offer and negotiations were cut off.
Then the college managers saw that
further concessions would have to be
made and they raised 10 per cent, but this
was not satisfactory to the Olympic Club.
The percentage share went up until the
college managers were offering 85 per cent
of the net returns of all matches to be
played. The Olympics still held out, and
then negotiations broke off again.
This was some few weeks ago. Be
tween that time and last Thursday Man-
agers Brown and Prichard conferred and
they did a lot of figuring. The returns of
the last several seasons were reviewed,
and they saw that a good pile of money
was made in the preliminary games.
Their next offer was an out and out
proposition to pay the Olympic Club $ir>oo
if it would guarantee to organize and put
a good team in the field. The necessity
of practice was felt by the college men
and something had to be done to insure it.
The athletic club considered this proposi
tion and after due deliberation accepted
It.
According to the agreement now ex
isting between the athletic club and the
colleges, the latter will have to do all the
advertising, arrange all matters in regard
to the games and bear all the expenses.
The Olympic Club will simply be forced
to have its team on the field at the ap
pointed hour and play its game.
The directors of the Olympic Club think
that with a due exercise of economy they l
may play even on the season. The ex
penses of a football season are tre
mendous, but with proper management
the club officials think that they will not
lose anything on their team this year.
This Is the first time since the begin
ning of football on the coast that any
thing of this nature has been done. It
was a division formerly. This season each
college pays $750, and the Olympics agree
to play with them eat with them and
fight with them, it the necessities of the
game demand it.

THE SAN FRAISTCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1898.
CHARLES L. PATTON FOR MAYOR
Leading Republicans Unite in Requesting Him to Head
the Municipal Ticket
ptHARLES L,. PATTON will, in all probability, be the Republican
| nominee for Mayor of San Francisco; it Is hardly necessary to add
that his nomination is practically equivalent to his election. It has
been recognized all along that It would be necessary to exercise
the greatest care In selecting a man to head the municipal ticket in or
der to Insure success this fall, and those having the welfare of the party
most at heart have been at somewhat of a loss to decide as to who
would be best fitted to make the canvass.
Charles L. Patton has been conceded by everybody to be the one
man above all others whose nomination would be certain to bring vic
tory to the Republican standard, but the one great difficulty lay In gaining
his consent to accept the nomination. Before the meeting ,of the State
convention Mr. Patton was urged by leading Republicans throughout the
State to allow his name to be presented for the gubernatorial nomination,
and after his refusal to enter that contest it was thought he would not
consent to enter the mayoralty campaign.
A number of the most prominem Republicans met yesterday to discuss
the situation, and. it was decided unanimously that Mr. Patton must be
induced to sacrifice his personal interests and inclinations for the wel
fare of his party ana of the city. Mr. Patton was not present at the
meeting. He was out of town all day yesterday, and had no knowledge
of the gathering, nor does he yet know of its result. But the decision of
those present will be presented to Mr. Patton to-day and the situation
laid before him in such a way that his friends have no doubt whatever
that he will consent to. accept the nomination.
Probably no man is better known throughout the State of California.
As one of the younger members of the legal profession, for he has but
Just entered the prime of life, he has gained a most enviable reputation,
not only among lawyers, but among all classes of business and profes
sional men. A man of wealth, a genial, polished gentleman, Mr. Patton
attracts all who come in contact with him; never repels them. Whole
souled and liberal almost to a fault, the man who is numbered among
Charles Patton's friends regards himself as fortunate indeed. Mr. Pat
ton is a prince of entertainers, as all will testify who have been included
among his guests. He is a man of marked executive ability and of un
bounded energy. Upon him, more than anybody else, rested the responsi
bility for the gigantic fair in aid of the Masonic Widows' and Orphans'
home, held in this city a few months ago, and to him alone is due the
credit for its splendid success, it having netted $35,000 for that woVthy in
stitution.

COOKSON DISPLAYS HIS OLD
SKILL WITH THE BALL.
In Yesterday's Match the Representa
tives of Alameda Were Nearly
Sixty Runs Behind.
Yesterday a match was begun on the
Alami'da grounds between elevens repre
senting the cities of Alameda and San
Francisco. The latter went to the bat
first, and, thanks largely to J. Myers'
score of 60, compiled the respectable total
of 132 runs. Seven of the Alamed^, team
were tried as bowlers, and of these Croll,
who took two wickets for six runs, and
Harbour, who took two for 14, proved
most successful. No fewer than five of
the team were caught.
When the representatives of Alameda
went to the bat Cookson showed that his
skill with the ball has not deserted him,
for he took five wickets for 25 runs. C. P.
Coles, 23, and F. J. Croll, 18, were the only
members of the team to get double fig
ures. The full results are appended:

Handball Contests.
Eleven well contested handball games
were played in Phil Ryan's court at 858
Howard street yesterday .afternoon. Li

and as a consequence Jim Nealon was
looked upon as being the champion, but
he got knocked out in one of his bouts
by Linehan and Houston, although he
had a crack partner in the person of
Kilgallon. This defeat only tended to
warm these two players up for a second
turn with the same team, in which they
came out the winners. The play and

THE POLICE TO
HAVE ANOTHER
BIG BENEFIT
Entertainment Now
Being Prepared.
THE CAPTAINS IN CHARGE
"LONG &U.OT" RATIGAN DE-
FENDS WITTMAN.
The Latter and Chief Lees to Flay
the Balcony Scene From "Borneo
and j uliet"â Extensive
Freparations.
The police intend to grive another enter
tainment for the benefit of the Widows'
ond Orphans' Aid Association. Evidently
unmindful of the scandal attached to the
last entertainment, "North Pole" Witt
man, realizing the necessity of swelling
the fund of the organization, has con
ceived the bold scheme of further hood
winking the public by having his famous
glee club appear before the footlights in
that clever skit, "How Conboy Beat the
Bank at Sausallto."
Wlttman has appointed the same men
on the committee who had charge of the
last entertainment to perfect arrange
ments, but it is not likely that they will
serve. Chief Lees wants the captain of
police to handle the affair, and as his
word is supreme the committee will in all
probability be discharged in the next few
days.
A meeting of the officers of the widows
and orphans will be held on next Wednes
day afternoon, when the several captains
will be authorized to make arrangements
for the entertainment. A feature of the
programme will be the* a~oearance of
Chief Lees and Captain Wittman on the
stage. They will do the balcony scene
from "Romeo and Juliet." "Long Shot"
Ratigan, the patrol wagon .driver, has
been selected to sing "My Mother Was a
Lady." While proud of his voice. Rati
gan does not like the idea of singing in
public.
"Me Pipes Are Frozen," he remarked
to a sympathetic crowd of policemen yes
terday, "and it will take some time for
them to thaw out."
"Caught cold from Wittman's feet, eh?"
inquired one of the policemen* looking
around to see if the Central station cap
tain was within hearing distance.
"Youse fellers give me a pain," 'Indig
nantly replied Ratigan, his face assuming
an angry expression. "Witt, is my friend
and I want yer to know it. I knew him
when he was on the street workin' as a
common policeman. Now that he is cap
tain youse guys have got yer hammer out
a-tryin' to soak him; but he's too foxy
for yer. I'm going to help him out, and
if me pipes are in condition when the en
tertainment comes off I'll be there to
speak my little piece. See! I suppose
them newspaper blokes will try to make
a monkey or me, but as I'm better edicat
ed then half of them I don't care what
they say about me. When I get on the
stage with my old pard. Captain George,
boosting me from the wings they will say
that I'm alright. After the entertain
ment me and George will have a few cold
bots and maybe a warm bird or two. I
caught a ten-spot in the Chinese lottery
yesterday, and when I get the dough I'm
goin' to buy me friend George a pair of
foot-warmers.
"Say, did I speak of George's feet? Well.
I didn't intend to. I'm shot to pieces and
don't know what I'm talkin' about. Don't
think you can jolly me, as I'm dead on to
my job. I shouldn't be drivln' the patrol
wagon, as I was Drought up better. But
wait until you see me and George do a
skirt danceâ l mean the living pictures.
Say, I guess youse fellers are right; I'm
a dead one."

Park Congregational Church De
voted to the Great Work of
Extending the Tenets of
Christianity.
The structure recently completed to
serve as the place of worship for the
Park Congregational Church was for
mally dedicated yesterday shortly after 3
o'clock. Rev. F. I. Wheat, who has ac
cepted a call to the pastorate and who
left a prominent congregation in Brooklyn
for the purpose, officiated at the cere
monies. He was assisted by Rev. J. K.
McLean, D.D., who delivered a fervid
address; by Rev. William Rader of the
Third Congregational Church, who also
talked briefly on the spread of Chris
tianity, and by Rev. F. B. Cherington,
D.D., pastor of the Plymouth Congrega
tional Cliurch .
.Rev. J. R. Krodgjl spoke of the pros
perous condition of many of the churches
in this city, and argued that this was an
evidence of the interest which people take
in religious matters. The board of direc
tors and the treasurer, F. A. Hatch, then
expressed themselves through the me
dium of the latter, showing that the
church is undergoing a rapid and sub
stantial growth.
Rev. George C. Adams. D.D., made the
announcements for the week, and the
congregation sang a hymn. This was fol
lowed by a special service in which the
deacons participated, and then the new
pastor. Rev. Mr. Wheat, offered the
dedicatory prayer. He acknowledged the
divine aid in all successful human ef
forts and asked that assistance might
always be granted us in all our undertak
ings. He concluded his prayer with an
eloquent appeal for God's mercy and
guidance, and the congregation united in
the singing of the doxology. Benediction
was then pronounced by Rev. Philip
Coombe, pastor of the Richmond Congre
gational Church, and the simple but im
pressive services were concluded.
BOTTLEMEIR'S CONCERT HALL, reopened
with the Union Ladles' Orchestra, 513 Pacific st.
Bishop Nichols at St. Peter's.
Preceding the services at St. Peter's
Episcopal Church last evening three
young ladies were admitted as members
of the Daughters of the King, and Bishop
Nichols, who addressed the congregation,
adapted his sermon to the occasion. He
took as his subject "A law of the spirit
ual kingdom," and compared and con
trasted the spiritual law with the natural
laws. The singing at the service was by
a fully vested choir of boys, young ladies
and men led by J. W. Wilkins.
