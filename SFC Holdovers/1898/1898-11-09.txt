LOS ANGELES MAKES RESPONSE
Rolls Up a Big Plurality for Her
Favorite Sonâ Counties That
Were Considered Doubtful
Fall Into Line.
The election returns show be
yond doubt that the Republicans
of California have achieved a
great victory over their fusion
opponents. The predictions fre
quently made by The Call in its
extended and exclusive reports of
Mr. Gage's tour of the State have
been verified. It was predicted
that the great surprise of the
campaign would be the magni
tude of the Republican triumph.
In the light of returns at hand it
is clear that Mr. Gage's majority
will exceed 20,000.
Another happy result is the
gain of two if not three Con
gressmen. Mr. Waters (R.) has
surely defeated his fusion oppo
nent in the Sixth Congressional
District, and Julius Kahn (R.)
has defeated James H. Barry in
the Fourth District. The wave
of Republican success may have
volume sufficient to overthrow
the fusion majority of 1500 in the
Seventh District and send to
Congress Mr. Needham (R.).
There is also hope that Frank D.
Ryan will win in the Second Dis
trict against the fusion candidate,
De Vries. At this hour the indi
cations are that California will be
represented in the next Congress
by six Republicans and one fu
sionist.
Returns from Senatorial and
Assembly districts are incom
plete, but there is no doubt that
the Republicans will have a joint
ballot majority in the next Leg
islature and be able to elect a Re
publican Senator to succeed Ste
phen M. White. The figures at
hand lead to the belief that the
Republicans will have a working
majority in each branch of the
Legislature.
A bitter and unprincipled fight
was waged against two of the
nominees on the Republican
State ticket. These two nomi
nees^Justice Van Fleet for the
Supreme Court and Charles F.
Curry for Secretary of State â ran
far behind the head of the ticket,
and one or both may be de
feated. The Republican State
Committee at an early hour this
morning did not concede the de
feat of either, and would not

claim that the incomplete returns
indicated the election of either.
The majority for Gage and
Neff in Alameda, Santa Clara and
Sacramento counties does not
surprise The Call. The results
were clearly foreshadowed by this
journal, which had the honor of
leading the battle for the success
of the Republican cause.

NOTHING DOING IN THE
WAY OF EVACUATION
HAVANA, Nov. B.â No business -what
ever was transacted to-day by the Evacu
ation CommissionerÃ. The members of
the American Commission seem much an
noyed at the unnecessary prolonged de
lay of the. United States commissions ap
pointed to select camp sites and arrange
for transportation, who seem to have ac
complished little or nothing but to post

stores and supplies. The landing place
at Playa de Marianao will be completed
this week.
Suicide at St. Helena.
ST. HELENA, Nov. B.â R. A. Hawkins
committed suicide Ui the Windsor Hotel
this morning 1 . The man came down from
the St. Helena Sanitarium and immedi
ately went to a hardware store and pur
chased a pistol and cartridges. Then he
engaged a room at the hotel, saying to
the landlord that he was sick. Shortly
after the man entered the room a shot
was heard. He was found lying on the
floor in front of a mirror, his head in a
pool of blood, with the pistol lying by
his side. On his person was found a
letter from his wife, dated at Snelling,
and $4 in cash. He was an American,
aged about 65.

may live several days. Banks was prom

DEMOCRATIC LOSSES RECORDED
Districts in This City Heretofore
the Strongholds of the Bour
bons Are Now in the
Republican Column.
Gage has swept the city, and
5000 will not cover the plurality
the first count has given him.
From the strongholds of Ma
guire he has come out with votes
to spare; from districts supposed
to be hopelessly Democratic he
has majorities to show, and in ev
ery precinct, those lost as well as
those won, his vote has more
than realized expectations.
It was a landslide, for it was
thought Maguire would make a
hard fight in San Francisco, his
native political heath. Instead
returns kept pouring in to the
anxious watchers, each adding
more to Gage's vote, until there
seemed to be no one else in the
race.
The people were not left long
in doubt as to who had won.
From the very first it was so ap
parent that cheers were heard for
"Gage, the next Governor," al
most as soon as the polls were
closed, and then it swelled louder
and longer and higher until it
ended in red fire and rockets and
bombs, and all the signs of a
great and signal victory.
The most excitement over the
news was shown in the streets
and by the cheering crowds, but
in the State Central Committee
rooms was where the vote found
most appreciation. Prominent
Republicans from all over the
State were gathered there with
returns of the last election ready
for comparison with those of this,
and the monotonous click of the
telegraph telling of Gage's gains
in the country was broken only
by news of his victory in San
Francisco. It came by wire, by
messenger, by word of mouth
and by glaring skies, and when it
was all over friends took up the
tale to fill it out with congratula
tions.
Neither Maguire nor his friends
can offer an explanation of the re
sult so far as this city is con
cerned. At Democratic head
quarters it was confidently ex
pected that he would carry the
city by a plurality of not less than
10,000, and with this he expected
to overcome any plurality his op
ponent might receive in the
State outside of San Francisco.2

MR. GAGE SAYS THE
PEOPLE REPUDIATED
ANARCHISTIC THEORIES
Attributes the Republican Landslide iQ California
to OppositioQ to Ideas That Tend
Toward Social Revolution.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. B.â "The intel
ligent and thinking people of California
have placed the stamp of c".!sapproval
upon the principle of the single tax
and all other propositions advanced by
theorists that have a tendency to lead
to social revolution. This Is what I
would say was one of the great causes
of the political avalanche In California
in 1898 in favor of the Republican State
ticket."
This was the statement made by
Henry T. Gage, the next Governor of
California, at 11 o'clock this evening,
when asked to give his idea of what
were the causes that brought about his
phenomenal victory at the polls to-day.
"I take it that voters of this
State," said Mr. Gage, explaining fur
ther, "felt that the election of my op
ponent would give aid and comfort to
the anarchistic classes, and that it was,
therefore, essential in the interests of
good government that he be defeated.
"Under the leadership of Judge Ma
guire the Democratic party of Califor

the public schools of the State, and this
the voters have resented in an unmis
takable manner. The result also dera
JUDGE MAGUIRE BOWS TO
THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY
Of course I have not analyzed the result of the election and cannot do so on the data obtainable to-night.
The issue was clearly presented between corporate monopoly and popular rights. We made a great and
earnest and clean fight. We were supported by as grand and loyal and patriotic a body of men and women as
ever glorified any cause on earth. A majority of the voters seem to have been against us and we bow to their
decision. The interests involved were theirs as much as ours, and, while we think their verdict erroneous, we
recognize their authority as rightfully supreme. Believing our principles and purposes to be right we will con
tinue to advocate and advance them, and will neither take nor permit any backward step.
JAMES G. MAGUIRE.
In addition to the above Congressman Maguire stated In general conversation that he felt relief that the
contest was over and that he was out of politics forever. He announced that he would Immediately resume the

Mr. Gage received the returns at his
ranch, eleven miles from the city. The

The election In Los Angeles County
to-day was a very quiet affair. No
disturbances occurred and a light vote
was polled. Indications are that thf>
entire Republican county ticket is
elected by a good round majority.
George L. Arnold, for member of the
State Board of Equalization, will run
behind his ticket, although he may
carry the county. In districts where
workingmen reside there was a heavy
Republican gain for Gage. Owing to
the fact that very few straight party
tickets were voted the count Is very
slow and not before noon to-morrow
can exact figures be given.

plurality in the State for Thomas for I
Governor. In 1896 Bryan's majority \
was 135,000. They claim 15.000 plurality j
in this city. Shafroth (Sil. R.^ in the I
First Congressional District and Bell j
(D.) in the Second are re-elected. The \
Legislature will be strongly anti-Re- j
ADVEBTISEMEN'J.'S.
A HARDJIGHT.
The battle of ballots is over; it was a short contest so far as this city
was concerned, but waged with unusual force and fervor. Ladies of re-
finement engaged in the canvass openly and vigorously worked from house
to house in behalf of their friends. We do not encourage this plan. It is
to be regretted that a large percentage of the voting population of the
town did not register and failed to vote and that among these are found
many citizens who are deeply interested in local and national politics. We
can always trust the voice and vote of the American people, and at this writ-
ing, without knowledge of the result, we are sure that the right will pre-
vail and all will voluntarily assent to the will of the majority.

Rumor That Trading
Was Done.
Up to 2:30 o'clock this morninc very
flttle progress had been made in count-
Ing the municipal vote. In some of the
precincts the count of the State ticket
was not yet complete.
Every indication points to the fact
that Charles L. Patton has carried the
city by a very safe majority over
Phelan. Forecasts made by the Demo
cratic managers yesterday gave the
slty to Maguire by a majority of 10.000
and to Phelan by a majority of 3600.
THE ELECTION IN
SAN FRANCISCO
Incidents and Peculiarities of the
Contest Between the Great
Parties.
Total vote cast . . . 55,180
ELECTION day has come and
gone, and now all that re
mains to be done is the fix
ing of the exact measure of
success or failure.
In San Francisco the elec-
tion as well as the campaign
that preceded it was one of peculiar
<ignifieance and was marked by condi
:ions never before presented at a gen
eral election. Strong, bitter partisan
ship rather than party lines separated
:he opposing forces, and it is safe to
<ay that more than 75 per cent of the
rotes cast were cast in accordance with
personal preference, regardless of the
politics of the voters. The straight Re
publican or Democratic tickets that
â¢nund their way into the ballot boxes
jvere few and far between.
Viewed from the standpoint of a dis
uterested spectator the election passed
Dff quietly, and there was little out-
a-arcl indication of the undercurrent of
excitement, personal feeling and pri
vate Jealousies that dominated the
popular mind and influenced the ulti
mate result. The absence of visible
â¢igns of the more than personal interest
taken by voters in the proceedings of
;he day and the final result of the day's
â¢vents was due, no doubt, to the pecu
iar nature of the campaign Just closed.
Sever before in the history of the State
lave the issues at stake been so plainly
let forth before the people, not alone by
the press of the State, but by the op
posing candidates themselves. In many
respects the manner in which the cam
paign was conducted in this city was
more like a house to house canvass
than any ever before seen here. The
candidates sought out the people and
laid their various claims for recogni
tion before them by word of mouth. If
there was a voter within the confines
of the city who did not know what each
and every candidate had to say for
himself and the principles for which
he stood it was not for lack of oppor
tunity.
As a result of this campaign of edu
cation the great mass of the voters
went to the polls yesterday with their
minds fully and finally made up as to
their choice of candidates. There was
no stopping on street corners to argue
concerning the merits of respective
candidates, and there was no button
holing by strikers paid to loiter about
the polling places to catch the man
whose vote could be influenced.
The business of voting began at the
time of the opening of the polls and
went ahead with clocklike regularity
tutU the closing hour.
In this connection It is proper to give
due credit to Registrar Biggy, who for
months past has been untiring in his
efforts to instruct voters as to their
rights and their limitations. Thou
sands of questions hÂ»ave been answered
through the medium of his office and
all complaints of whatever nature, both
before and during the day of election,
were promptly attended to and a law
ful and satisfactory adjustment made.
The effect of this was apparent yester
day in the few mistakes that v.ere
made regarding the location of propor
polling places, the rights of voters and
the details necessary to the proper
casting of ballots. At Registrar Biggy's
request, the Grand Jury remained in
session all day yesterday and last
night visited a great number of the
polling places in the city during the
progress of the count.
1 he vote cast was unusually large in
proportion to the registration, a fact
due in part to the perfect weather, but
more particularly to the conditions al
ready enumerated concerning the per
sonal interest taken by voters and the
intensity of private partisanship. With
the exception of a few insignificant
rÂ«i\vs and a few arrests for minor of
fenses against the election laws, the
day was devoid of incident. Watch
ers at the polls had very little to do
Results show that Maguire's vote did
not come up to expectations by an ap
proximate of 15,000. and it is reasonable
to sunpose that Phelan's vote will be
proportionately less.
It was asserted in certain quarters
last night that the unexpected vote
given Gage in this city was due to the
fact that Phelan's managers at the last
moment had effected a combination by
which he traded off Maguire in order to
secure votes for himself.
I and the police were out of employ
ment.
In many of the districts south of
Market street a peculiar condition of
affairs prevailed. Men who have all
their lives been known as stanch Dem
ocrats were out working openly in the
interest of Gage or Patton, or both.
Former ward bosses who have hereto
fore drilled behii.d the Democratic band
wagon, but who were not considered
sufficiently "high toned" for the new
order of things in the Democratic
camp, were out making a fight for the
Supervisorial candidates on the Repub
lican ticket who had been selected from
among the residents of the ward and
not by the Democratic plan of coloniz
ing from among the kid glove and silk
hat job chasers of other and more aris
tocratic districts of the city. What
these men did was plain to the view of
all men. What was done by the "si
lent vote" â the ballots of the men who
express their views by their ballots â
will be seen by scanning the returns.
Whatever the result, the election may
be considered one of the most satisfac
tory and successful in the history of
the city. As the vote cast was an in
telligent vote, the result will be the
will of an intelligent majority.
HOW THE DAY
PASSED AMONG THE
VOTING BOOTHS.
It was a peaceful election yesterday,
except in one or two precincts, and the
active partisan was more conspicuous
for his quiet demeanor than for his
aggressiveness. Tales of riot and al
most bloodshed came from the voting
booth of one of the downtown precincts
and rank inebriety was reported* from
another, but in the main, the day passed
quietly. It was only after the count
began that the real excitement com
menced.
The voting was heavy in the morn
ing, in some of the precincts over half
the votes being cast before 12 o'clock,
and the usual rush just before the polls
closed was not apparent. How the
hours passed at the booths follows:
The Twenty-Eighth â
The Twenty. eighth District was unusu
ally quiet yesterday. In not one of the
sixteen precincts was there as much ex
citement as there has been at any time
since the nominations. .Early In the
morning the men began to vote and by
noon fully half the ballots had been cast.
By 2 p. m. three-quarters of the voters
had visited the polls and at closing time
nearly the entire strength of the district
had been voted.
There was a strong anti-Phelan feeling
around the booths and throughout the dis
trict, but in no district was Phelan with
out a following ready to shout for him
on the slightest provocation. Very few
of the candidates visited the Twenty
eighth. Dr. O'Donnell was out in force,
but no one treated him as a serious fac
tor. Still, in many of the precincts he
polled a heavy vote and in others ran
i'r. Ed E. Hill a close race for first
honors.
The Twenty-Ninth â
Long before the polls were opened
crowds of workingmen gathered before
tlif- booths in the Twenty-ninth Assembly
District and awaited the arrival of the
election officials. For two hours after the
balloting began the voting was heavy;
then it began to full off and gradually
dwindled down to .1 few stragglers. Dur
ing the noon hour there wa.s another rush
and then the voting seemed to be over.
Judging from expressions by the voters
indications were that the Republican
ticket was receiving greater support than
two years ago. of the voters cast
their ballots and returned to work.
There were no disturbances nor arrests
In the district during the day.
The Thirtieth-
Over 50 per cent of the ballots cast yes
terday in the Thirtieth Assembly District
wre deposited in the ballot boxes before
noon. Unlike former flections there was
no rush as, the hour of closing ap
proached. The election passed off quietly
and there were no unusual incidents.
Very tew voters told hoÂ».- they had voted
and they went their way as soon us their
ballots had been cast. Republican gains
are looked for in this district. Registra
tion was much lightep than two years
ago, and there was also a decrease In the
number of votes cast.
The Thirty-Firstâ
Almost a Sabbath quiet prevailed
throughout the Thirty-first Assembly Dis
trict during the balloting yesterday, and
: but for the hurrying and scurrying of
! candidates and their friends there were
i no outward indications that a State and
municipal campaign of unusual interest
and bitterness had reached a climax.
The police officers on duty at the vari
ous precincts had nothing to do except
stand around and chat with their friends
about the probable result. About three
fourths of the usual vote was polled in
this district. Voters naturally expressed
a belief that their favorite candidates
were sure wlnnners. No accurate esti

mates on the drift of the balloting could
be obtained.
The Thirty-Secondâ
The Thirty-second District lies south of
Bryant street, and is what is commonly
known as one of the "tough" quarters of
the city; but everything was quiet up to
the time of closing the pulls. Â» oting
started in early and kept up steadily all
day, but the poll was unusually heavy in
the morning.
The Thirty-Thirdâ
The Thirty-third, which takes In a great
portion of the Mission Potrero and South
San Praacisco, also saw a quiet day. At
the Fourteenth Precinct there was a
slight delay early in the morning, owing
to the fact that through an error the bal
lots received were . for the Thirty-first
District. This was soon corrected, and
the voting- went on Steadily up to 5
o'clock. Some few voters who had re
moved from their precincts within the
lasi thirty days attempted to vote, but
were promptly challenged, and swallowed
their medicine like men.
The Thirty-Fourthâ
In the Thirty-fourth Assembly District
there was a heavy percentage of votes
lost through removal into other precincts,
but those that remained voted almost to
the full number. The balloting was
heaviest in the Second Precinct, where
215 votes were cast out of 235 resist rations.
The Eleventh followed with 213, and the
rest of the twenty-one precincts listed
from 15<1 to 200 each. Sundaylike quiet pre
vailed throughout the district. There was
no Incident of any kind. Practically all
of the ballots were < -;ist by 2 o'clock in the
afternoon, and the count* was begun at 5
o'clock to the minute.
The Thirty-Fifthâ
In the Thirty-fifth the same condition
of affairs prevailed. The voters came in
early and did not loiter around the polls
after their mission had been accom
plished. The liveliest booths were those
of the Eleventh and Twelfth precincts on
Mission street, near the earhouse. The
downtrodden railroad men, who it has
been alleged were to be forced to vote the
Republican ticket, turned out. and not
only voted but worked for the success of
the ticket with such enthusiasm that two
of them had to be "called down" by the
police for doling "tit campaign literature
inside the 100-foot limit. Butane arrest was
made in the entire district, and that upon
no more serious charge man drunk and
disorderly. An inebriated voter in tne
Tenth insisted not only upon voting his
own ticket but wanted to exercise the
same privilege for every one who came
Into the booth. He was. thrown- into a
patrol-wagon and sent down to the City
Prison.
The Thirty-Sixthâ
The Thirty-sixth Assembly District,
which covers about one-fifth of the area
of the city, lies west of Guerrero and east
of Fourteenth street, extending to the
ocean and to the county line of San Ma
teo and hounded by the Mission road
from Thirtieth and San Jose avenue to
Guerrero and Fourteenth. This district
embodies the Almshouse, the inmates of
which voted at the Eighteenth precinct,
located at Seventh avenue and X street.
A good many of the aged voters came
hobbling along on the roadway bearing
heavily on canes, while others who were
too feeble to undertake the journey on
foot were carried in on wagons from the
institution by orrler of Superintendent
Reddy, who afforded each man every
facility in hip power to go to the polls
to cast his vote. In this precinct there
were 296 voters registered, and out of this
number 113 had deposited their votes in
the box at tho noon hour. At this time
there were Quite a number from the Alms
house waiting to enter the sacred box
and mark their tickets; forty of the num
ber who had voted from the Almshouse
had to obtain the assistance of the oIR
. , is of the polling place to make out their
tickets The voting In this precinct was
constant the entitle day. as 11 required a
long time for some of the voters to mark
their tickets. The Seventeenth Precinct
i- in the Sunnyslde district where the
voting was kept up at a lively clip dur
ing the earlier hours of the day. In this
precinct EJatton and Gage had quite a
number of warm advocates. At Ingleside,
where the race course is located, every
thing was dull, as the Twenty-second Pre
cinct had but a few Stable buys regis
tered From the way the voters attended
in this district it looked as if there would
be a falling off of about 15 per cent of
the voters registered from those who did
vote Everything was conducted In a
quiet and orderly manner throughout the
district.
The Thirty-Seventh â
With the exception of a few challenges
the election in the Thirty-seventh I>is
trict was devoid of interest. The voters
appeared early, and before noon over
three-fourths of the total vote had been
polled. A contractor named O'Neil made
a determined fight against Captain
c, independent candidate for Public
Administrator. The friends of the latter
claimed that notwithstanding O'Neil's ef
forts the vote will show that Freese will
have a majority in the district.
The Thirty-Eighthâ
Immediately after the polls opened in
the Thirty-eighth a large number of citi
zens seized the opportunity to cast their
ballots for their respective candidates. In
one of the precincts nearly the total vote
was polled before noon.
Bonnet, for Sheriff, had a number of 1
friends working for him, prominent
among- whom was Colonel "Bob" Barton
and John Koopman. Louis Raitigan, the
"pride" of the district, worked indefatiga
bly to add to the majority of "William
Deane for County Clerk. It was claimed
by the friends of Deane that he had a
majority of between 800 and 1000 votes
over his opponent in the district.
The Thirty-Ninthâ
The election in the Thirty-ninth Dis
trict passed off (fÃietly. Immediately af
ter the polls were* opened a large number
of voters deposited their ballots. Before
noon nearly three-quarters of the votes
in the district had been cast. In the
First Precinct a drunken man started to
raise a disturbance, churning that he h.wl
been unlawfully deprived of his vote. As
It was shown that he was not registered
in the district he was promptly ejected
from the polling-place by a policeman.
The Fortietn and Forty-First â
Fully half the votes in the Fortieth,
Forty-first and Forty-second districts
were" cast before 10 o'clock yesterday
morning. Tho heaviest voting of the day
occurred in these districts between the
hours of S and 9 a. m., and by 2 o'clock
In the afternoon three-fourths of the en
tire register had been scratched^as voted.
When in the evening the polls were de
clared closed very few had neglected to
cast their ballots, and in consequence tho
percentage cast is even greater than that
of the last election. As far as could be
ascertained there were no disturbances,
the voting progressing steadily but quiet
ly. Friends uf all the candidates hovered
around the booths, and naturally all
claimed that their favorite was running
ahead of the ticket. In these districts,
however, from a careful canvass it ap
pears that Maguire and Gage ran about
even, while Charles L,. Patton led in the
fight for the Mayorship. Bettman for the
Senate and Rellly for the Assembly both
ran strong in tbe Fortieth and Forty-first
districts.
The Forty-Second â
In the Forty-second Ashe and Dennery
both claimed big majorities at the close
of the polls. Tho Republican ticket in
general was believed to lead in these dis
tricts, where so many business men re
side, notwithstanding the wall to the con
trary raised by Democratic candidates,
Democrats and many renegade supporters
who have changed their politics.
The Forty-Thirdâ
The hottest battle of the day was
waged in the Second Precinct of the
Forty-third District. That there was not
bloodshed was due to the vigilance of the
police.
The fight centered in the struggle for
State Senator. There were two candidates
âLeon Dennery and R. Porter Ashe. me
latter had a gang of bullies behind him,
who started to run things to .suit them
selves.
Soon after the polls opened the gang of
ruffians proceeded to intimidate voters.
One of their number ran afoul of Louis
Sternberg, and was promptly placed hors
de combat. Sternberg was arrested for
battery, but at once was released on cash
bail. There were several other disturo
ances, but further than a few black eyes
and bruised noses nobody was injured.
Thinking that serious trouble was immi
nent, an immense crowd gathered in tne
vicinity of O'Fnrrell and Stockton streets
and eagerly awaited the opening of hos
tilities Police Commissioner Gunst, fear
ing bloodshed, telephoned to Captain Witt
man to send a squad of men to the scene
at once. With drawn clubs the policemt-n
dispersed the crowd, but not until several
were made to feel the effects of the
locusts in the hands of the guardians of
tlu- police. , â _
Last night the friends of Dennery were
betting 2 to 1 that their candidate was
elected.
The Forty-Fourth â
A holiday calm pervaded the majority
of the precincts in the Forty-fourth Dis
trict. The vote was a. heavy one, being
but little less than the total registration.
It was steady throughout the morning.
I si i that by noon considerably more than
half the votes had been cast. The only
ripple on the surface was the strupirle
between M. H. Barry, Republican candi
i date for the Assembly. and Thomas O.
' Reilly, his opponent. Some of their fol
low, fs engaged in a wordy argument in j
the First Precinct, but nothing came ol I
it. In several precincts men tried to vote
who. upon being challenged, refused to
swear in their ballots. I^uke Fay. Demo
crat, was one of the hardest workers in
the Fifth Precinct.
The Forty-Fifthâ
There was a total absence of political i
workers In the Forty-fifth District. Where
once Colonel Mazuma and the "push"
were strongly in evidence there was but
little sign of life and activity. To the
casual observer there was no electioneer
ing, no handing out of cards or button
holing of voters. The utility of this
method has been removed apparently by
the Australian ballot, by which a man
becomes his own master once he steps
inside the election booth. Along the
North Beach district there were but few
loiterers about the booths. Down on the
water front the same condition prevailed.
Goat Island is included in the Sev
enth Precinct and a boatload of men
came ashore and enjoyed their right to
vote. A number of those registered are
men employed on coasting vessels. Some
of these lost their vote through being on
the high seas. There was no disturbance,
the police having a day of comparative
leisure, although standing a long watch.
SLOWNESS IN THE
MUNICIPAL COUNT
As the night wore on it became evident
to Registrar Biggy that there was no
hope of obtaining any coherent returns
of the count of the municipal vote.
From many parts of the city he received
notice that the judges and officers of elec
tion, exhausted probably by the State
count, were progressing very slowly. In
many booths the greatest confusion ex
ieted, owing to the presence of half-in
toxicated men, and In some cases to the
incredible slowness of the officers. From
the Second Precinct of the Thirty-first
District the officers appeared at the City
Hall carrying the ballot-box, and evident
ly in no condition to continue the count.
The Registrar at once caused their arrest
and made arrangements to have new offi
cers sworn in. Many warrants were
asked for other incapacitated officers, and
It was reported that several booths might
have to be closed for the night in order
that efficient men could be appointed in
the place of those apparently in charge.
In spite of the difficulties of the situation
the Registrar showed remarkable ability
to meet all exigencies, and is confident
of having things running smoothly to
day. k _
MR BIGGY SPENT
A VERY BUSY DAY
Complaints Received Prompt At
tention and Law Reigned
Supreme.
Beginning: at an early hour yesterday
morning the office of the Registrar of
Voters at the city building was besieged
by anxious inquirers seeking information.
Many of them reported that they had not
been allowed to vote by the election offi
cers in their precincts, but the fact de
veloped in nearly every case that there
had been a change of residence to some
other precinct. Mr. Biggy informed each
of these persons that they had forfeited
the right to vote. A number of them went
away protesting against the loss of their
franchises, but the majority philoso
phically accepted the inevitable, under
standing that no one except themselves
was to blame. Altogether some 600
would-be voters made election day calls
on Registrar Biggy.
The word which had gone abroad con
cerning the extraordinary precautions to
be taken to apprehend fraudulent voters
evidently had a salutatory effect, as no
attempts at illegal voting were reported
at the Registrar's office during the day.
Many persons who appeared at the polls
had 'their votes challenged for removals,
etc but the old-time repeater was notice
able for hiss absence. Such was the word
that the Registrar received, and it caused
him great satisfaction, as indicating the
thoroughness of the preparations made
under his direction.
To be sure, there were a number of in
fractions of the election rules brought to
Mr Biggy's attention throughout the
<Yiy About 7:30 a. m. word came over
the 'telephone that there was trouble In
Precincts Five and Seven of the Forty
third Assembly District. The Registrar
at once proceeded to the scene. He found
that the election officers in the Fifth Pre
cinct had thrown out a Republican judge
and had chosen a Democrat in his stead,
while in the Seventh Precinct the re
verse had happened, the judge thrown
out being a Democrat. The plea was
made in both cases that the discarded
judges had been from throe to four min
utes' late in Tt aching the booths, and that
it had therefore been necessary to swear
in substitutes from among the bystanders.
The Registrar decided against the sub
stitutes and ordered the two belated
regular judges into the booths, despite
the opposition of the precinct officers. "It
was a put up job in both cases," remarked
the Registrar, "and I do not propose to
allow such tactics. I tore up the papers
of the two substitute judges."
Another case which smacked very
strongly of a thwarted attempt at Illegal
voting "developed during the early hours
of the day. It appears that two men,
giving their names as W. J. Harrison and
W. J. "Wallace, had registered as living
at 5Vs Page street, which happened to be
the place of residence of Deputy E. T.
Russell of the Registrar's office. This
fact was discovered several days ago, but
not until after W. J. Harrison had ap
peared at the office and demanded the
cancellation of his registration. As neither
Harrison nor Wallace lived at the place
mentioned the Registrar instructed
Deputy Russell to He in wait at the pre
cinct where he was entitled to vote and
to capture Wallace if the latter appeared
and attempted to cast a ballot. The
watch proved unsuccessful, however, as
the man did not appear.
At 2 p. m. word was telephoned to the
Registrar that the entire force of elec
tion officials, with one exception, in Pre
cincts of the Twenty-eighth District and
Precinct 9 of the Forty-third District
were too drunk to attend to business.
Uiggy at once telephoned the central
committees of the various parties to de
tail new men from the reserves to go and
take charge of the voting booths.
A few minutes later H. L. Ray com
plained over the telephone that there was
crooked work going on in Precinct 1 of
the Forty-fourth District, stating that
there was connivance between the officers
appointed by the various political parties.
He asked ihat Immediate attention be
given to the matter by the Registrar, ahe
nitter dispatched a representative to the
scene, who speedily put things in good
running order.
Mayor Phelan was one of the visitors
at the office of the Registrar during the
noon hour. He entered accompanied by
his secretary, Colonel Sullivan, and ap
peared very much incensed at something.
The cause soon developed. "I war^: to
know," exclaimed he, "who appointed
Marcus "VVolf as a Democratic Inspector
in the Second Precinct of the Thirty
eighth District? He's out shouting for
Patton for Mayor. Now, isn't he a line
Democrat?"
The Registrar looked over the list in his
office, and, sure enough, there was the
name of Marcus Wolf, inspector, with the
w r ord "Democrat" next to his name. It
transpired that Ed Gallagher had ap
pointed Wolf, and the Mayor made copi
ous notes on a piece of paper and ti.en
started out on a search for the City and
County Attorney, presumably to give him
a piece of his mind for choosing Demo
cratic officers of election who could not
be depended upon to support the Demo
cratic candidates. The episode occasioned
considerable amusement among the by
standers in the Registrar's office, which
was heightened when the discovery was
noised abroad that Wolf was a pro
nounced Republican, who had been mak
ing campaign speeches for Gage and Pat
ton and who had accepted the office of
election inspector, supposing that he had
been chosen as a Republican.
Exactly at 5 p. m. Mr. Biggy began the
work of destroying the extra ballots
which were in his office, using a printing
office paper-cutter to chop them in pieces.
This work occupied over an hour, and was
conducted in the presence of a number of
witnesses summoned for the purpose.
HEAVIEST ELECTION
BETTING ON RECORD
Thousands of Dollars Wagered on
Gage at Odds of 2 to 1
and Better.
The betting on the election was the
heaviest ever known on this coast. This,
too, outside the wagers of hats and small
amounts wagered among friends to back
their opinions as to the strongest candi
dates.
Harry Corbett pronounced it the biggest
betting election within his memory. He
handled nearly $65,000, ;<nd would have
filled out the hundred thousand mark had
there been sufficient time to place the
money before the returns commenced to
be received.
When betting commenced yesterday
morning Gage had ruled favorite over
Maguire at odds of 2 to 1. As the day
wore on the odds gradually lengthened.
At nightfall the odds had gone to 4 to 1
and no Maguire money in sight.
In the struggle between Phelan and Pat
ton the former opened favorite at 2 to 1.
In the evening Phelan money went beg
ging. 3 to 1 being offered.
The only other contest upon which there
was extensive betting was that between
Julius Kahn and James H. Barry.
Throughout the day it was even money
and take your pick. Once the count be
gan Kahn was installed favorite at 10 to
4 with few followers of the short ena.
I^ater on 10 to 3 was offered, and but lit
tle money changed hands even at that
price.
William Pinkerton, the noted detective,
won a hundred each on Roosevelt of New
York and Gago.
There was but little money placed in
the big cigar stores-, which are usually
custodians of much money. In one of the
stores a man wagered $200 to $40 that
O'Donnell would not be elected Coroner.
The man who took the short end had $500
to wager the same way.
A MULTITUDE AWAITS
NEWS OF THE RESULT
Call Bulletins Telling- of the
Progress of the Count
Capture the Town.
One hundred thousand people were
downtown las. night to read the election
bulletins showing the progress of the
count both in this city and State and
throughout the Union.
The crowd paraded up and down Market
street, and the bright colors and gay hats
of the ladies gave that thoroughfare a
carnival appearance. The carnival spirit
was abroad. Everybody appeared good
natured, and if the returns were such as
to prevent some from cheering, ii would
be hard to single them out of the multi-
The followers of Maguire kept up their
hope till the very last. They found conso
lation in the fact that the returns showed
the rival candidates running closely to
gether This was small comfort, and even
this was finally swept from them when it
was announced that the Democrats con
ceded the election of Gage.
The Call's bulletins captured the town.
They were by far the most complete, and
were displayed to splendid advantage. A
crowd thatnearh- blocked Market street
gathered soon after 7 o'clock. Sergeant
Conboy found the people easy to handle,
and was congratulating himself on ins
success. An hour later he took a different
view of the situation. At that time tne
street was a seething mass of humanity.
On each side of the street a few people
filtered by, unless caught in some great
jam where they could neither advance nor
T*Â« - ' I* â¢" " L T
The Call bulletins from all over the
United States were displayed by stereop
tlcon in the rotunda of the Claus Spreck
els building. They were at a natural
height, and there was neither straining of
the eyes nor necks to read the glad tid
ings of the Republican triumph.
The first opportunity to develop the sen
timent of the people was the announce
ment of Theodore Roosevelt's election as
Governor of New York. This announce
ment was followed by a splendid picture
of the colonel in the familiar uniform
of his own troop of Rough Riders. This
brought out all the pent up patriotism of
the people, and they cheered the popular
citizen-soldier again and again.
The returns from the Interior of this
State were by this time being received,
and showed Republican majorities from
even' section. It was then announced:
"Gage's election conceded by a large ma
jority." This was followed by a portrait
of the next Governor, which was greeted
with thunders of applause.
The returns were interspersed with pic
tures of gallant Admiral Dewey, Hobson,
Schley. Sampson, Shatter. Joe "Wheeler,
Miles, President McKinley and others.
Eaoh was in turn applauded.
Notwithstanding the size of the crowd
there was no roughness of speech or of
action. For a time those nearest the car
tracks amused themselves rocking the
oars, but no damage resulted. The cars
looked liko ships at sea as they went
slowly through the crowd. There were
no accidents and the crowd slowly dis
persed, until at midnight it was but a
gbost of the throng that had gathered
early in the evening. It was, to all out
ward appearances. Republican in make
up and in sentiment, and was duly appre
ciative of the Republican triumph pre
dicted by Republican orators.
JOY AND GLOOM AT
RIVAL HEADQUARTERS
Effect of the Outcome of Election
Upon Republicans and
Democrats.
Matters will liven up around the head
quarters of the Republican County Com
mittee to-day. As there were no official
returns sent to the committee rooms last
night a condition of ennui and suppressed
excitement took possession of the few
clerks who were forced to remain within
the walls and answer the questions of
news seekers. The State Central Com
mittee was the working body last night,
and first enjoyed the news of the over
whelming victory, but to-day, when the
complete returns of the municipal count
begin to pour in, the county committee
will be the tirst to enjoy the news.
The only labor that tell to the cierks
in the county committee headquarters
was answering questions of candidates
on the anxious seat and furnishing volua
teer watchers with badges ami certni
cates of authority, xiepublicans by the
score anxious to see that no infractions
of the election laws occurred visited the
headquarters and were vested with au
thority to see that their wishes were
cted. At midnight the rooms were
closed for the night, but at sunrise th;s
morning the; will be. crowded with hu
manity waiting to know the full extent
of the Republican victory. Victory for the
greater portion of the ticket is assured,
but before the people will rest they must
know that not one candidate has been
neglected at the polls.
The headquarters of the Domocratio
County Committee were practically de
serted last evening. No returns were re
ceived by the few left in charge of the
place, and they simply sat and mused.
An air of gloom pervaded the neighbor
hood, and no one careu to break the si
lence. Crushing defeat stared the adhe
rents of Democracy in the face, and they
did not have the courage to bear it
bravely.
Outside the doors several of the defeat
ed hovered and occasionally one would
calculate: "If Gage has got in and car
ried off the Democratic strongholds,
where is Phelan'.' That's the Question!'
Then the unfortunate committee of one
hundred would receive a grilling calcu
lated to make any member of that "au
gust" aggregation of political corruption
ists desert his party.
W. P. Lawlor. chairman of the Union
Campaign Committee, said:
"I urn not yet sufficiently conversant
with the conditions of the districts from
which adverse results were received to
ascribe to any cause our defeat. "We have
had our day in court; we have had our
hearing and the people have rendered a
verdict against us. That is all. As Amer
ican citizens we submit to the will of the
people."
Doubtless the Maguire League of Clubs
wili abandon its rooms in the Parrott
building to-day or as soon as it can make
way with the fe.w effects it has placed
therein. An excited crowd of Maguire
ites occupied the rooms last evening and
made things merry on several occasions
when alarming rumors of stuffed ballots
and double counts were received. These
were readily disproved and all hope was
abandoned.
HOW THE NEWS CAME
TO THE HEADQUARTERS
Prominent Republicans Hold a
Jubilee in the Central
Committee Rooms.
The men of the Republican State Com
mittee who have been on duty at head
quarters or elsewhere since the opening
of the campaign never entertained a mo
ment's doubt as to the result of the bat
tle, yet it was obvious to spectators yes
terday that they were awaiting the re
turns with a feeling of deep interest.
Throughout the day telegrams were re
ceived from the interior counties stating
that Republicans were active and conn
dent, but these messages did not excita
enthusiasm. Returns were wanted to
make assurance doubly sure.

About the Shrewd Los An

Dr. McDonald declared in one of his
letters, the managers of the institution
had been led into the very jaws of the
lion.

B These letters remove for the first tinr 3
the terrible mask of hypocrisy that Dr. i
11. H. McDonald wore while he lived in
this city. They show that Moses H. :
Sherman is more responsible for the
ruin of the Pacific Bank than any
â¢ other man, with th exception, perhaps,
of D. S. Dorn. The part that this attor
ney played in that conspiracy is yet to
be exploited by The Call, and will be
exposed at the proper time. When the
letters that are published this morning
were written M. 11. Sherman was |
not yet trembling in dread of th action
of the Grand Jury, nor had D. S. Dorn
yet promised him to protect him from
that tribunal. ..
dr. McDonald refuses to
pledge HIS PRiVATE
FORTUNE
â  There are few letters In all the won
derful collection of the correspondence
of the Pacific Bank and the McDonalds
that are of more general public and
pathetic Interest than that of Novem
ber SO, 1892. In this letter Dr. McDon
ald writes two emphatic instructions to
his sons to burn the epistle after he has
read it. In one place he counsels Rich
ard to read the letter twice over care
fully and then burn it, and in another
â  he reiterates the injunction to consign
, the epistle to the flames. Dr. McDon
ald had Just received a letter from his
boo telling him of iL- approaching dis
solution of the Pacific Hank and the
destruction of the People's Bank, and
begging him to return and mortgage
his property for the benefit of the de
positors. Dr. McDonald had given his
solemn ~ronjise to the Bank Commis
sioners that he would do this.
He had left this city with that prom
ise on his lips. He had made it twice,
and had deluded the Bank Commission
er: as to the time when he "would re
turn and keep his promise. When his
son begged him to fulfil his word, the
old man replied that "if the bank must
go down for the- want of my money It
will not receive one dollar of my pri
vate fortune." Having made this posi
tive refusal to assist the institution of
which he was- president; Dr.. .McDonald
: then gave a piteous prophecy of the
downfall of the bank, he then turned
- upon his children and his family, and
with hin cruel lash struck them again.
The letter la as follows:
. : Sunday Night, New York, Nov. 30. 1592.

THE AGED FINANCIER DENOUNCES

failures of the Pacific Bank can be

for us in the end. You seem to have

should not nave done. He is evidently a
bright, smart fellow, who seems to'do
much of his talking in a whisper, and
1 have- always be^n suspicious of such.
He may turn upon us and do us great
damage or extort large blackmail.
You are and have beeri pending such
fellowi as he, Jenningson. Mitchell and
Toniblin from place to place, whom I
fr;ir have done far more harm than
good, ani we knuw they have done
injury In more than one instance. You
seem to have a policy way â a cunning
wayâ of doing things that I know any
thing about, and nearly always proves
a boomerang that hits the "party on
the bead that attempts to manage
business in such a way, and will be
likely to prove injurious to us in the
business now in hand.
â¢ That Jennlngson, he does not know
much, but I believe him to be one of
the biggest liars you will find any
where, and always looked upon him as
an unfit man for the trusts in his
hands. But all these situations you
took in your own hands, keeping
everythlnK from others until in the
lielii. And there is Mitchell. I have a
rfmall opinion of his ability for outside
purposes; and as for Tomblln, there is
no u?e in discussing his wisdom and

THE OLD MAN GREW BITTER
OVER THE TREACHERY OF
EMPLOYES
On December 11, 1892, the elderly Mc-
Donald wrote to Richard telling him
very calmly that if he were not very
careful he would break the Pacific
Bank. This is the first warning that
any of the conspirators cared to give
each other that the end was approach
ing. The old man suggested that if
what his son knew about A. F. Johns
was true they sooner they got rid of
that gentleman the bettftr. Some rather
caustic advice concerning the divorced
wife of Dick. Clara Belle, was given,
and the old gentleman closed wishing
his son a merry Christmas, and to con
sume the letter in the flames before his
own eyes. Dick overlooked this In
junction in the rush of holiday busi
ness and the epistle is as follows:
NEW YORK. Doc. 11, 1892
My I'far Son Richard: I have spent
considerable time tills afternoon in
trying to read your letter of the 15th
Inst in which you criticize Mr. Johns,
all of which I hope you will explain
fully to Frank, and if he is what you
think he is he should be gotten rid of
at once. This misfortune with us it
seems that we cannot secure clerks,
any of them of such ability as can be
trusted with our business. That Ma
dora bank and our vineyard there
troubles me. I think it dangerous. It
will prove a hole into which a great
deal of our money will go and be lost
if great care is not taken. That Ce
dar River coal mine must have atten
tion or there will be great waste there.
If in fact you are not careful the Pa
cific Bank will be bursted, and that
will be the end.
Sister Josephine writes me a letter
just to say that she understood that
Clara Belle was living with her father
In Carson City. Nevada. 1 cannot be-
Hf-ve it, but it may be so, and if she Is
there look out for her for she will come
upon you In one way or another, and
if you meet her again there will be a
revival of the old scandal, damaging
to you. My boy. you have not seen the
last of that designing. wk-Kert woman
yet. And she if so much smarter in
her schemes than what you are that
you are at a great disadvantage. If
you were to appear to have less anxi
ety to get your child the sooner you
wfll get it if you can get It at all. At :
one time she cared very little for the
child, but now as her last hope of re
spectability to lean upon she will prob
ably hold on to it with great tenacity,
and' if she can sell it to you she will
steal it from you again if snicfc a thing
is possible. â '..; '-'â Â» - t-ii-i ...
You will be followed up and -deviled
by that ,woman a.Â« long as you remain
as you are. If you w,ould get married f 
to me good woman it. would Be the
end of -all your troubles.: After read
ing this letter over it may be well to ,
give it to Frank to read and then con
sume it in the flames in your own
sight.
Wishing you a merry Christmas, I.
am affectionately your father, â

SHERMAN'S CRAFT WON ONE
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOL
LARS MORE
On December 13. 1892. the old man, !
bowed down by the weight of worry,
penned a letter touching sadness. He
reminded his sons that they were re
sponsible for the wrecking of the bank. â 
an institution that had been his urid-e j
and which he hoped would preserve a j
fortune and bring honer to his sons.
la his old age he saw the work of his j
life crumbling into worse than nothing,
and he cried .to God to explain to him
this mystery of misery. He reminded
his sons how he had fought Sherman i
with all the determination at his com- j
mand when the Los Angeles conspira- |
tor came to him again to demand
another loan of $1000.
The old man wanted them to let the
road go and suffer the loss as it stood.
His sons overruled him and Sherman in }
his flattery and craft obtained $100,000,
As if this were not enough the old man
begged Dick to remember that after
thy had lost $40,000 in the John Brown j
colony he wanted to draw out and j
charge the loss to experience, but th^y
would not listen to the advice and went ;
deeper into the scheme until they stood
to lose $300,000, with absolutely no pros
pect of saving themselves. Dr. McDon
ald's letter is as follows:
ASTOR HOUSE, N. V.. Dec. IS. 1Â«Â»2.
My Dear Son Richard: It does seem
if anything can be relied upon that
there will soon be an end tn these de
lays and we will get- some money, but
that bad. bad, bad. bad Los AilkeleS:
road building is indeed a severe blow
to us. and how much we will lose by it,
is not yet easy to estimate.
You will remember when Marble and
Sherman came to me at Pa?o Robles
Springs and pressed me to loan Sl'/
to help the road I' refused and was
stubborn and determined to let the
road then and there go into the hands i
of a receiver, and we take our .chances
with others as to the outcome, but you
and Frank went on over my head and
did the very thing I had determined
I would not do. Tf we had stopped
there we would have probably lost
from $25,000 to $50,WH). and now we will
not get out of it in a loss of two or
three times that amount.
When we were into the John. Brown
â¢ colony for about $40,900 I stopped and
let it go. make what loss we must
and get out of it. You and. Frank lift
ed right over my head and made a \
300,000 debt of it all told, and if we
dear up with a loss of sioo.ooo I will
feel wpII satisfied. And other mat-, !
ters have gone much the same way.
Most of them planned and the obliga
tions made in secret.- Had the facts
been known it is not likely that they
would have occurred. But. we are into
this unfortunate dilemma now. and
there is no use for us to complain or >
growl of sweet milk spoiled and lost, j
The question is how to get out of
them if such a thing be possible.
The failure of the Pacific Bank will
be a terrible blow to me in my old
age. It. has always been jny pride and
intended as the monument over my
gravp and ' a rich Inheritance to my
children as an honorable mention to
them and by the people of them. But
we know not what a dÂ«y mny bring
forth. It is said riches take for them
selves wings and fly away very often,
the truth of which we are verifying-:
While these financial matters are in
deed troublesome, they are mere mat
ters of money, and I neve.r did care
much about money in my life for the
cake of having money merely, and
therefore I could lose it without any
great strep* of mind on my part, after
I have done my humble best to. save it.
1 often ask myself in humiliation
ano prayer why has this humiliation
and distress been left for me to pass
through after T have passed the three
score and ten milestone. I know it
must be for some good purpose, and I
will bear it as well as I can, for I
â¢ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE FOR SHERMAN.
In one of the letters of Dr. R. H. McDonald is the story of another of the
. . schemes of M. H. Sherman. In this letter the old man rebukes. n{s sons
for having Â«lven Sherman one hundred tfioupand dollars more to assist the
. L.c>Â£ Angele* electric ruilway road after the road had brought the Pacific
Bank to the verj?r of bankruptcy. This letter shows what a tremendous
influence Sherman exercised over Frank McDonald, and leaves no possible
question of the fact that Sherman was using: the bank simply to float his
own personal private projects.

at work all these weeks and months,
and seem near the consummation or a
sale and it must not fall through for
a little money to put and keep it in a
salable condition. Mr. Dyer has been
of immense advantage in carrying j
forward this sale. \ It was certainly a
great great, great blunder to nave al
lowed him to have gotten into. us for
such a large amount and his affairs
entwined and mixed with ours as it
has been, but we are in for it and the .
question is how to get out and save
: something of our money and what we -
can of our family from moral. turpitude
and ruin as well."
The foregoing letter indicates what
flatten', sycophancy and craftiness
were worth to M. H. Sherman. Another
guarantee of $75,000 was certainly
worth some concession.
SANCTITY AND SHREWD BUSINESS
FORESIGHT STRANGELY AS
SOCIATED.
The elder McDonald could pose with
quite as much hypocrisy as his sons.
The following letter needs no comment;
it speaks for itself:
NEW YORK, Dec. 29. 1592.
My Dear Sons Richard and Frank: I
would rather give up every dollar I had
on this earth and pay off all my debts
and stand before the world as I have
always tried to do. an honorable and
honest man. than to live in this finan
cial condition for years longer. This
putting my name on future notes I
hope will by some means be stopped.
In the case of disaster it would be
hard for all hands. It should be
stopped by all means. Affectionately
your father, R. H. McDONALD.
"OUR HEADS ARE IN THE LION'S
JAWS."
On January' 14. 1893, Dr. McDonald
penned a letter that will be remem
bered as long as the story of the wreck
of the Pacific Bank. After two years
of fraud and failure, conspiracy and
theft the McDonald family realized
that the wreck of their fortunes and
their names was due to M. H. Sher
tnan. When this realization came to
the banker the old man wrote. "Our
head.s are in the lion's jaws and we
will b* crushed." Sherman had set a
steel trap for them and they had taken
the bait, but Sherman had fallen into
the same trap and the old man assured
his sons that the Los Angeles schemer
must fight with them or go down with
them. The letter is a. most remarkable
one and is as follows:
NORFOLK;. Va.. Jan. 14. 1593.
My Dear Son Richard: Your letter
speuK 01 accepting in': *-*'Â»â¢. '.-"M lor uui
â  Los Angeles bonds and the difference
of opinion between you and Frank on
that subject. In answer I -will say I
cannot consent to -the giving .0%. an
opinion on so important a matter aa
the one involved. .>*â¢â¢â¢,-â¢'
Frank has been giving that matter a
great' 'deal of thought and attention
mid his opinion on the subject, should
be duly considered and appreciated, I
think. We have our heads in the lion's
jaws just nqw.. Let.us.be very careful,
thoughtful and considerate in getting
it out or we will certainly* be crushed
by the animal. ... . ,
What you say about Sherman I fully
believe and appreciate, butdon,'t forget
that he is in the pen with us and ,is a
full partner that cannot be ignored at
the present time.- And we ; mus.t.make
common effort and common battle to
gether or all is lost and we must go
, down together. And it will not do to
offend or kick him just now as our
business? matters 'stand. We wiU only
the more injure ourselves in doing so,
in all probability. This whole- matter
.from the start was a. steel trap set to
catch the Pacific Bank In. We have
taken the bait and the trap was sprung
.and we are fast in it. Xhe question is
how to get out alive and if so with as
little injury as possible. - If we can get
back on a solid business basis for a
. loss of one-half of all my business in
terests in the Pacific Bank and one
half of all my personal property out
side of the bank. T will feel quite well
satisfied, taking into account the losses
by the John Brown colony. Cedar. Riv
er. Coal Company and other losses upon
us and likely, soon .to comet upon us.
The question now Is how we may
save ourselves from utter ruin and dis
graceful bankruptcy. The whole of
these matters are now in the hands of
and under the control of you , and
Frank and they will go up in safety- or

Walter 'N. Parrish Answers " His
Wife's Complaint for Divorce.
On October 22 Mrs. M. Parrish Sled with
the County Clerk a divorce complaint in
which she asked that the. bonds of matri
mony existing- between Walter N. Par
rish and herself be annulled. In support
of this she alleged-, extremest cruelty,
profanity, intoxication, destruction of
bric-a-brac and treatment so repulsive a3
to cause her the loss of twenty pounds
in weight from mental anguish.
Yesterday Walter N. Parrish filed a de
tailed and explicit denial of the allega
tions set forth by his wife, except for the
j smashing of the bric-a-brac, which, he
| says, was his own. and was demolished in
I a fit of passion when his wife sought the
company of cigarette smoking women. He
further denies . that he has .caused, her
mental anguish sufficient to reduce her
weight, "except when remonstrating with
her for her light and. giddy conduct, and
her overwhelming desire to go upon the
streets and to rush to dancing parties."
He claims not to have been seen coming
out of a saloon intoxicated, or having
ever accused his wife of uacosstiÂ£y I
He alleges against his wffcE- thku Vhlle
residing at Mitt .Valley in ' a bouse! the
front portion of which was used as a
saloon, she frequently drove and walked
with" Theodore Hanson, the landlady's
son; : that she took up a residence un
known to him on Golden Gate avenue,
"and spent most of her time at theaters,
on the streets, at Hyde-street beach, at
the park and at numerous dance halls

husband."

Result of the Canvass of the State Ticket Among the Local
Precinctsâ No Municipal Returns.

could be obtained from 13.
Incomplete as they are, however,
they show a plurality for Gage of 2657,
and all the indications point to double
this when all returns are In. Neff is
following him bravely.
Thompson leads for Secretary of
State by over 4000, and Johnson has a
slight lead over Woodman.
Conley and Van Dyke are in the lead
for the Supreme Court, Edwards is 1000
to the good for the Board of Equaliza

A VERY BAD SLUMP.
The Votes Mr. Maguire Has Cost the Democratic Party
in Four Years.
Four years ago San Francisco gave the Democratic candidate for Gov
ernor, James H. Eudd, 11,454 more votes than she did to Morris M. Estee,
the Republican standard-bearer. James G. Maguire loses this great advan
tage, over 20 per cent of the total vote cast in 1894, and 2687 votes besides.
He has cost his party 14,141 votes, nearly one-third o-f the total vote

PATTON PROBABLY
GETS A MAJORITY
Continued From Third Page.
Twenty-eighth, so the tidings that Gage
was leading Magulre in that quarter of
the city were received with enthusiasm.
While Major McLaughlin and Colonel
Burns were feeling particularly happy
over this unexpected advantage. Judge
Elijah Hart began to receive messages
from Sacramento showing immense Re
publican gains In that county. Toward
9 o'clock the messages giving assurances
of a great victory were coming in so
rapidly from all quarters of the State that
Jacob Steppacher could not get them
posted up for display as rapidly as they
came In.
The joy was Increased when news came
by wire and special messengers that Ala
meda County would give Gage 3000 ma
jority. The glad tidings was wired to
Governor-elect Henry T. Gage by many
of his personal friends and supporters.
At 12 o'clock, when 12.000 ballots in San
Francisco had been counted and the mar
gin of advantage for Gage indicated that
he would carry San Francisco by a ma
jority of nearly &000, there were shouts of
joy in the committee rooms. About the
same time Judge Hart secured additional
accounts from Sacramento indicating
that the Republican majority in that
county would exceed the estimates based
on the first returns. Better and better
came the news as the night wore on. The
euggestion that San Francisco would win
that banner which Los Angeles and Ala
meda counties had alternately won for
many years caused much merriment.
From San Diego, Los Angeles, San Ber
nardino. Placer, Nevada, Glenn, Monte
rey Riverside. Sisklyou and Fresno coun
ties' came messages reporting Republican
gains.
Assurance came by wire also that
. Waters. Republican, was a winner in the
/ Sixth Congressional District. Reports
' from the city at the same time indicated
that Julius Kahn had downed Barry for
Congress in the Fourth District. There
â was glory for the committee in the gain
of two Congressmen in California.
The committee rooms were densely
packed with leading Republicans of the
city. Police Commissioner Mose3 Gunst
brought in the cigars and Chief Lees was
privileged to smoke them. Everybody
was happy, and Major McLaugrhlin and
Colonel Burns were serenely jubilant.
SOME INCIDENTS OF
A QUIET ELECTION
Few Arrests Marked the Progress
of the Voting Throughout
( the City.
From the opening to the closing of the
polls yesterday there were fewer arrests
made than on any previous election day
in the history of the city. The first arrest
was that of Dan Sweeney, a bartender in
a saloon at Natoma and j Second streets,
for Belling liquor on election day. It was
the only arrest of the kind. He was re
leased on $50 cash ball.
Jerry Jones, a pattern-maker, raised a
disturbance In the polling booth of the
First Precinct of the Thirty-ninth District
by objecting to a voter registering his bal
lot. Some one shouted that he had a re
volver, and Policeman Rankin placed him
under arrest for carrying a concealed
weapon, which was found upon him.
Jones declared he had a permit, but could
not show- it. He was released on his own
recognizance, by Judge "Low. â¢'.. â '-â ":â ' â¢
John J. Gradj', an expressman, while

out three times, and as he persisted in re
turning he -was arrested and booked at the
prison for being drunk. Brown made
every effort to get him released, but
failed.
Shortly after the polls had closed In the
Eighth Precinct of the Forty-fifth word
was received at the Republican State
Central Committee Headquarters that the
officers in the polling booth of the Eightn
Precinct, Forty-fifth Assembly District,
situated on the east side of Sansome
street, between Pacific street and Broad
way, had neglected to destroy or cancel
the unused ballots as required by law.
Frank 11. Powers immediately went down
to the pfclling-place to investigate. When
he arrived there he found the information
i given to the committee was correct. The
! surplus ballots were lying on the table
; in full view of everybody. The officers of
! election were ignorant of the law on the
subject, and Powers began to read it, and
ordered the ballots to be canceled. In
spector Gately and the other officers did
not recognize Powers' authority in the
matter and refused to carry out the order
unless they were instructed to do so by-
Registrar Biggy. Powers then telephoned
to the latter how affairs stood in that
precinct and a deputy was at once sent
to see that the law was carried out. The
unused ballots were canceled by his or
ders and placed In an envelope, which was
properly sealed.
Inspector Gately said that nothing crim
inal was Intended by the precinct officers,
but as long as they had not been notified
by the Registrar to destroy the ballots
they did not care to assume the respon
sibility of bo doing. They did not know
Powers, and did not think he had any
right to Issue any orders.
During the night the police received
numerous callÃ to suppress supposed riots
in various sections of the city. All the
available men were kept busy, but in
most cases the calls turned out to be
false alarms.
J. M. Soldnels. a Republican watcher
in the Third Precinct of the Forty-third
District, objected to a ticket being de
stroyed, and as a result of the hot words
which followed he had a personal
encounter with Joseph Woods, one of the
election officers. Soldnels was arrested
and charged with battery and Interfering
with an election officer.
The notorious "Lefty" Bannon also got
in trouble at the Seventh Precinct of the
Thirty-fourth District and waa lodged in
the City Prison on a similar charge.
Headquarters of the various candidates
began to assume a very animated ap
pearance about midnight. The friends of
the candidates assembled In Jarge num
bers in the headquarters of their favor
ites and discussed the latest bits of news
with eager interest. Special heelers, ward
rounders and political 9ages for once were
the equals of the candidates, and the man
who rushed in with the latest returns
was pure of a warm reception. In the
various clubs in the city special arrange
ments had. In many Instances, been made
for getting the returns as rapidly as pos
sible. Early in the evening the news of
thÂ« State fight began to be received, and
each bulletin waa read and received with
cheers according to the sentiments of the
crowd. There was a large crowd at the
Press Club and the Bohemian Club. The
returns were also read to the audience at
the Orpheum.
A small disturbance developed in the
Seventh Precinct of the Thirty-fourth
District on Twelfth street, between Fol
som and Harrison, last evening. It was
cauaed by a dispute over a ballot on
which a cress was placed a little below
the nnme of P. J. McCormack, but which,
the Judges decided, was meant aÂ« a vote
for him. Exception was taken to this by
a couple of brothers named Bennnn and
a wordy xvar ensued. No blows were
struck. The police arrived after the af
fair had been settled.
The Chinese availed themselves of their
right to vote and were objectÃ of interest
in a number of booths on Stockton street.
Six men from the Orient were registered
in the Fifth of the Forty-fourth, and
ir.arked their ballots like native born
citizens. â¢ â -â 
Edward McÃlhane created a scene late
In the afternoon, in the booth on Bush
street, near Powell. He was properly â  reg
istered, but asked .that some one assist
him In marking Ills ballot. The law ex
pressly prohibits this except in cases of
physical disability. As he had ', the use of
one of his hands the election officers re
fused him assistance. He threatened them
with punishment if they did not help him,
but they â  could not be moved from * their
Bt^Uld.

TRAJAN'S ARCH.
To the student of sculpture this great
series of reliefs has come like a revela
tion. It was not supposed that Roman
art was capable of producing a work
of such breadth of conception, of such
an artistic combination of beauty and
strength. The skill and picturesqueness
of composition, the dramatic quality of
single figures, and especially what we
caÂ»i only term their life, are beyond
anything done in sculpture since the
altar at Pergamon. What we have
from the times of Augustus Claudius
and Titus Beems lifeless and monoton
ous in comparison.
With the uncertainty that reigns in
regard to the history of Roman sculp
ture, any work of assured date is wel
come.
It is amusing to see how many theo
ries are overturned by the arch. For
example, the best authorities have been
dating Roman busts from the style of
head dress, assigning a special kind of
style to the reign of Nero, another to
Tftus, another to the Antonines, etc.
There is now consternation in this
camp because all these manners of
head dress are found together on our
arch, and this convenient aid to datinsr
has vanished. While I am referring to
portraiture, let me call attention to the
superb portraits of Â«reat Romans on
the arch.
There Is, of course, a collection of
fine heads of Trajan himself, which will
at least double the number of his
known portraits; there is more than one
of Hadrian, Trajan's nephew and aide
de-camp; of Llcinlus Sura, his oldest
and most intimate friend, secretary and
chief of staff, and of other men who
were the Emperor's companions and
lieutenants in his wars. The arch Is a
mine of wealth of many kinds, and for
every one it is a beautiful work of art,
whcih may well serve as an inspiration
to modern artists as the most perfect
work of its kind that antiquity has pro
duced.âCentury.
M. DE FONTENELLiE'S BRIGHT
SPEECHES.
M. said of a young fellow who
did not see that a lady was in love
with him: "ion are very yourfg; you
can only read large print."
A preacher said: "When Pere Bour
daloue preached ajt Rouen he caused a
great deal of disorder. The workmen
left their shops, the doctors their pa
tients, etc. I preached there the fol
lowing year and set everything right."
A collection was made at the Acade
my and there was a louls-d'or short.
A member whose avarice was well
known was suspected of having with
held his contribution. The collector
said: "I did not see the gentleman
put in, but I believe he did." Fon
tenelle settled the question by Remark
ing: "I saw, but I don't believe."
A lady ninety years of age said to M.
de Fontenelle, who "was ninety-five:
"Death has forgotten us." "Hush!"
replied Fontenelle, putting his finger
on his lips.
M. de Fontenelle, then in his ninety
seventh year, having just paid Mme.
Helvetlus a thousand pretty compli
ments, passed her, on his way to the
table, without seeming to notice her.
"See," said Mme. Helvetius, "what ac
count I should take of your gallantry!
You went by without looking at me."
"Madame," said the old gentleman, "if
I had looked at you I should not have
passed by you." â Gentleman's Maga
zine.
WHY JURY TRIALS ARE TEDIOUS.
"There is a very general objection
among business men to serving on Jur
ies in civil or criminal cases," observed
a well-known business man to a Star
reporter; "not altogether because It oc
cupies time which a business man can
hardly spare, but because of the meth
ods pursued by lawyers in trying cases.
They waste too much time in words,
words, and nothing but words. An or
dinary business man will develop and
absorb all the material facts In a given
case In less than half the time it takes
a lawyer to do so. He applies business
methods, direct and positive, while the
ordinary lawyer applies legal methods,
which are covered up with time-honored
cobwebs. The lawyers don't use direct
questions or leading questions, because
it is against courthouse practices to do so,
while a business man always uses them
in preference to going about it in a
roundabout way. It is very tiresome
for a business man to have to sit in a
courtroom all day long listening to
lawyers splitting legal hairs as to how
questions should be put tq witnesses or
answered by them. I had two sieges
of that kind in the Circuit Court be
fore I got on the Jury I am now on, and
if I can help it I will never serve- on
another. It is bad enough to have to
listen for hours and hours to unneces
sary evidence, but when one's Judgment
is further Insulted by the arguments of
counsel on both sides, the theory being

WOMEN IN SMOKING CARS.
While sitting in a Long Island Rail
road train I saw a woman take out of
her pocket a cigarette case and walk
into the smoking car. A few moments
later I saw her calmly light a cigarette,
toss the match away and lean back
lazily, puffing the tobacco smoke and
watching bits of autumn landscape
framed by the window.
She waa a well groomed woman of
thlrjy perhaps, with brown hair and a
face bearing the unmistakable stamp
of refinement.
One cigarette finished she lighted an
other in the same matter-of-fact "way,
while thirty pairs of masculine eyes
looked on with interest.
The conductor told me It was not in
frequent for women passengers to in
dulge in a smoke while en route from
town to country. They did it, he said.
In the selfsame spirit that a man
does, and bo far as he could see they
had Just as good a right.
"How do the men seem to take it?"
I inquired.
"Well, they never have objected bo
far. After their first interested stare
they go right on reading their papers."
INDEPENDENCE HALL GUARDIANS.
Councils' Committee on City Property
agreed to report favorably to the Finance
Committee the ordinance to provide for
the reorganization of the staff of Inde
pendence Hall upon the following mag-
JliSS 6". 1 salary basis: Superintendent,
12000; Assistant Superintendent, $1900' spe
cial officer, $800; eight ushers, at $600 each
three cleaners at $600 each; one engineer
at $900; one fireman at $340, and three
night watchmen at $600 eachâtotal. $13,
340. By some strange freak of parsimony
the committee omitted to provide for a
custodian of the Liberty Bell, but that
neglect will doubtless be rectified later
Fifty years ago one janitor and a
watchman took care of the hall, and .they
took such good care of It during their In
cumbency that It did not need to be re
stored until the new era of prosperity set
In. Now the visitors to the hall have to
run the gauntlet of a whole phalanx of
public servants, whose new uniforms will
make the Revolutionary heroes upon the
walls po shabby by comparison that the
restoration of the dingy, patriots in buff
will probably soon be called for.âPhila

COMMENTS ON OUR "BUTCHER'S
BILL."
Lord Wolseley has a special aversion to
sanitation, which he has described In the
"Soldier's Pocketbook" as a fad laying
down at the same time that sanitary of
ficers have no business at the front The
utterly irrational nature of this doctrine
scarcely needs demonstration. If it did
one might point, to the statistics that
have Just been published of the Ameri
can losses In the.war with Spain
â¦ It -appears 'â¢ rom l if flgrures that the
total killed In both army and naw
amounted to 279. and the total wounded to
1423, while; there actually died of disease
In camp 2086, and the total number treated
in hospital was something like 40.000 In
other words, twenty men were killed or
disabled by disease for every man killed
or disabled in action; There is only one
name for the man who In the face of
figures like" these could question the Im
portance of . an efficient army medical
service. He must be . a fool.â London

THE GREAT "STAKED PLAINS."
FORT WORTH, Texas, Sept. B.â The
vast changes that have been made out
of the great "Staked Plains" the past
sixteen are phenomenal. That
large expanse of unbroken prairie de
rived its name from the Mexicans and
Indians, who called It "Llanos Esta
cades," long before the advent of the
Americans. The scarcity of water dur
ing the summer months rendered it a
dangerous matter to attempt the jour
ney across them, and it is known that
many caravans of Mexicans in early
days making their way from the Rio
Grande into New Mexico perished
among their sandy wastes.
For many years after the country on
every side had been in a measure set
tled up the plains were looked upon as
a sort of forbidden region, the epitome
of everything that was inhospitable In
nature and totally useless for supplying
any of the wants of man. Those ad
venturous individuals who ventured far
into its dangerous depths reported it a
treeless, silent waste, without a sign
of life, except the buzzards that circled
high in the heavens or the coyote that
hurried across the trail and disappeared
like a flash among the sagebrush and
tall grass that lined the banks of the
dry arroyos. Huge whirlwinds would
appear to block the way for a time, and
then hurry off, as if disturbed by the
presence of men in those grim soli
tudes. In the early morning wreaths of
dust went spinning around before the
breeze, as if some desert sands had
arisen and had just begun to envelop
the great expanse.
The last case known of any one per
ishing on the plains was in 1890, when
two Americans and one Mexican, a
sheep herder, attempted to make their
way from Pecos City to Amarillo in
midsummer, and, being poorly provis
ioned with water and losing the trail
as well, soon died of thirst, as did
their horses. A peculiar feature of this
accident was that, although the coyo
tes and buzzards had picked the benes
of the Americans clean, the body of tho
Mexican had baked and dried In the
sun and was practically intact, owing
to the fact that the diet of the Mexi
cans on the border is always composed
in great part of chile and red pepper,
substances apparently not appreciated
by either the buzzards or the coyotes.
Since that day no other fatality that
is known has occurred on the plains.
The progressive rancher and cattleman
has year by year encroached on this
vast area, sinking- wells, running wire
fences, and rearing a better breed of
stock than is to be seen to-day any
where in Texas. Water is found from
20 to 100 feet, and in abundance. The
altitude of the "Ctaked Plains" district
insures the health of the stock the
year round, ad fever, anthrax and
blackleg are seldom heard of in that
region. Such great cattle magnates as
Colonel Slaughter of Dallas, John
Scharbauer of Fort Worth, C. C. Good
night of Midland, and many others of
equal note are now heavily Interested
in' this once forbidden territory â St.
Louis Globe-Democrat.
SNAKES IN AUSTRALIA.
There are five kinds of venomous
snakes in Victoriaâ the tiger snake, the
black snake, the brown snake, the cop
perhead and the death adder.
The last-mentioned 1b very rare in
Victoria and very venomous. It is
about two feet long, very thick in pro
portion to its length, of a dull-brown
color and with a flat, wide head. The
strangest thing about it is that many
people believe its sting is contained in
the tail.
Leaving the death adder out of the
count, there are four species which are
fairly common. The tiger snake comes
first. In popular estimation if not in
reality. It is regarded as the most
venomous and the most savage. It at
tains in some districts a length of about
six feet, but the majority of specimens
are from three to four feet long. Its
coloring is variegated, black and brown
on the back, and pale brown on the
belly.
When attacked it sometimes raises Its
head to a height of a foot from the
ground; and its appearance then, as It
rests with its head seemingly widened
out, its neck contracted, its forked
tongue flickering out of its mouth, and
its eyes blazing with rage, makes the
average man rather chary of approach
ing. One good point is that the back
bone of all snakes Is easily broken by
a blow from a stick, and the power of
locomotion is thus taken away. Next
on the list is the black snake. This is
rather larger than the tiger, and the
handsomest of all Victorian snakes.
The back is jet black and shines like
a well-polished boot, and the belly is
a beautiful salmon pink. It is less com
mon than the tiger snake and is very
frequently confounded with the copper
head. The brown snake is brown on
the back, whity-brown on the belly and
about the same length as the other two.
The commonest of all, at any rate near
Melbourne, is the copperhead which is
found in most parts of Victoria. As its
name implies it has a coppery head, a
dark back and a yellowish belly. â

MARYLAND'S MODERN NOAH.
A steam launch seventy-five feet long
being built two and a half miles from
â water is the unusual sight which may be
seen on the road from Pomona to Quaker
Neck. Kent County. The boat is building
within a few feet of the public road, and
many of the original timbers have rotted
away during the tedious continuance of
the work.
About fifteen years ago Captain A. Jud
son, a man who had "gone down to the
sea In ships" for many years, came to
THE EMPORIUM.
Kent and opened a store. After mer
chandising for a short time he bought a
pretty little home near the village of Po
mona and started a sawmill. Finally
the old sailor conceived the idea of build-
Ing his yacht. The keel was laid, the
ribs elowly assumed position, and winter
and summer the work dragged on. Years
passed. The first timbers began to de
cay, and before the completion of one
part the timbers were of necessity re
placed by new, and yet the pet scheme
was not abandoned, and now the dry
land ship is nearing completion.
The yacht is to be 75 feet in length, 11
feet beam and 6 feet hold. She will be
propelled by steam, and, the captain
says, will turn off twenty miles an noun
A cabin forty-five feet in length will be
built and fitted up for a long cruise, the
Intention of the captain beinÂ°- to revisit
many scenes of his early sailor life. The
puzzling question to the casual observer
is: How is this cralt to be got to the
Chester River, more than two miles
away? The captain says that with one
horse the launch will be quickly and
easily made. The boat now has the deck
on, and it is expected that the launch
will be made next summer. The launch
ing day will be made memorable, and the
sponsor for the ncvel craft has already
been chosen. â Baltimore Sun.
AMTERICAN COMPOSERS.
I>t the American study the music of
all nations and enrich his resources from
their achievements, and then write from
his own heart; for, after all, in the arts,
individuality is absolutely necessary to
triumph, and it is far better to be one's
self than to be merely the citizen of a
little province; better to stamp one's work
with an individuality than with the dia
lect of a district. Particularly is this true
In this ago of civilization, when travel
and electricity are slowly making the
world one great unit. The American,
being the composite of many races,
should have the widest field to choose
from; he should write from the most en
larged individuality.
The peculiar resources of the citizen of
the United States can be seen from the
fact that among the best compositions
written by native composers are a sym
phony descriptive of negro emotions, writ
ten by Henry Schoenfeld before Dvorak
ever advanced his theories; an Indian suite,
written by E. A. MacDowell; a Chinese
Suite, written by Edgar Stillman Kelley
from researches made in San Francisco:
a Greek tragedy set to music by Profes
sor J. K. Paine, and equaling Mendels
sohn's best work in this line; a religious
cantata based on an old Latin hymn by
Horatio W. Parker; the fiery songs set
to German, French and English words by
Ethelbert Nevin, and the musical back
ground to Longfellow's poem "Sandal
phon," by Harvey Worthington Loomis. â

GREAT SHOOTERS IN EUROPE.
In Europer where the question of
game supply does not enter into
consideration, killing for count is
recognized as legitimate and sports
manlike. He is considered to have made
a record of honor who has bagged the
largest numbers of birds or other game.
Thus we read of one Trauttmansdorff â
Prince Carl Trauttsmansdorffâ who has
to his credit for a, single day's shoot
ing the slaughter of 862 head of game,
with the best bapr of pheasants 303, of
partridg-s 632, of hares 416, of rabbits
638, of roebuck 12, of fallow deer 20. and
of black cock 14, and a best year's count
of 10,833 head of assorted game.
Another record smasher is Farl de
Graj-, whose exploits have been duly
tabulated for a series of years, from
1867 to 1895, His pheasant score was
111.119, with partridges, 47,468
grouse, 26,747wrabbits, and as many
hares, 2735 snipe, 2077 woodcock, 1393
wild duck, 567 deer, 12 buffaloes. 11
tigers, a couple o:C rhinoceros and 9000
assorted; making a total of 316,699 for
the entire period, or about 11,000 an
nually. This is a record which the most
industrious market shooterin this coun
try would needs work hard to equal.
In very truth the noble sportsman must
have been a monomaniac in the field.
Yet for all Ms slaughter the game sup
ply where he shot has not been per
manently diminished.
AN EYE TO BUSINESS.
She was elderly, with the indisputable
appearance of the well bred. Her black
gown was unpretentious, yet it had an
air of neatness about It which would
have distinguished it among any sur
roundings.
The North Clark street man recog
nized all this, and as the woman
crossed the street his eyes followed her
with a look of vague wonderment.
The opposite pavement was wet, and
when the woman reached it she hesi
tated, made a false step and fell.
The young man was at her side in an
instant and bent nervously over her
as she lay unconscious.
The crowd gathered quickly, but
when he shouted "Stand back!" it real
ized his earnestness and obeyed. He
carried her into a neighboring drug
store and called for water.
"Quick!" he said. The clerk stood be
hind the counter excitedly twirling his
fingers.
"Bring me water!" the young man
demanded again.
The clerk gasped: "Vat you want,
sodawater?"

ROOSEVELT'S VICTORY.
5Y loyal and intelligent Americans in all parts of
the country Roosevelt's victory in New York
will be hailed as one of the most cheering re
ults of the elections. While his contest, strictly
peaking, was only a State campaign, the issues in
olved in it were broadly national. It was a question
'hether courage and honesty could win against all the
' jrces of corruption banded together in the strongest
rganization known to American politics. The re
ult is a glorious victory for the right. It is another
vidence that the American people can be relied upon
d uphold honesty, no matter how powerful may be
le foes that combat it.
Theodore Roosevelt has never been a trimmer. He
as never been a mugwump. He has never played the
of a demagogue. He has been a stalwart Repub
can, and a thoroughly independent man at every
:sge of his political career. He has held on his way
t all times fearless in the face of every form of oppo
inon that confronted him in the path of duty,
.'either the clamor of mobs nor the threats of bosses
i swerve him from the faithful performance of
ork. His record in every office in which he has
een tried attests the sterling honesty of his character,
nd the votes cast for him yesterday prove that the
eople can be trusted to support such a man whenever
r e appeals to them.
The thousand demagogues who, after trying by flat
sry of the people to coax them into sanctioning in
ompetency or demeYit, went down to defeat yester
ay can find a profitable lesson in studying the career
f Roosevelt. They can learn from his triumph, when
.ompared with their own humiliation, the old truth,
'Corruption wins not more than honesty."
In redeeming herself from the menace of Tammany
lall New York has proven the soundness of Ameri
an political life. Roosevelt's victory is a victory for
opular government everywhere. It is a triumph for
or.esty and courage won under circumstances that
ustify a general rejoicing over it throughout the na-
FAREWELL TO fILL NAVIES.
!\ T IKOLA TESLA announces that he has per
\^ fected an arrangement by which any warship
* may be blown to bits without risk to the engineer
>f the deadly mechanism. There is one glance from
â¢he eagle eye of the operator, a twist of the wrist, and
is over but the newspaper accounts of a glorious
ictory. There is not to be any chance of salvage.
The fragments are to be so minute that the ocean
â¢reeze will dissipate them in a cloud of dust. Death
;ill be painless and plenty.
Tesla evidently contributes indirectly to the support
if a lot of space-writers. Ever and anon, or even
)ftener, the world is startled by the report of some
rent invention which is destined to revolutionize this
hing or that, and while waiting to see the revolution
tegin learns with surprise that Tesla has concluded
o switch his contemplated revolution somewhere else.
ust now it happens to be the destruction of ships
, t 'hich occupies his mind. Not that there is the slight
probability he will ever get the device into work
ing order. He seems to think an invention near
enough perfection when it has reached the stage to
>c written about.
Of course Tesla knows much of electricity. He
as caused it to cut curious capers. Nevertheless his
hree-column dissertations concerning inventions
vhich fail to get beyond a theoretical stage do occa
ionally become tiresome. When Edison is in an in
entive humor, he invents. A similar humor seizes
fesla, and he announces that he is about to invent.
"his illustrates a marked difference between the pair.
There is no crying need for a scheme to blow navies
Hit of the water. We have a growing one, and it is
nore useful intact and afloat. There is really satis
action in reflecting that Tesla's bark is about 50,000

<^~* OOD for Corporal Healy. He went as
-~"Â¥ a private to Manila, having been among
*^-^ the first to enlist in the First Regi
nent. To take up arms for his country he
esigned from a good position on The Call. He
vas in the battle before Manila, and for gallant con
uct was promoted to be corporal. Notwithstanding
is attention to military duties Healy has found time to
end to this paper some of the best letters the public
as had from Manila. His writings have been marked
y vividness of description and a never-failing modesty
,-hich kept the writer's personality in the background,
nu throughout have been enriched by a quaint hu
aor. Now Corporal Healy has been made Superin
endent of Schools in Manila. There is no doubt that
n the new position he will be as attentive to duty as
ie was when earning a reputation as a good news
laper man, and later as a brave soldier in a gallant
cgiment.
It is worth remembering that under the single tax
-lan Maguire would not pay a single tax.
CALIFORNIA TO THE FRONT.
CALIFORNIA will receive the congratulations
of her sister States this morning upon the
splendid vote of yesterday. The combination
of Democrats, Populists, Silverites, single taxers,
calamity howlersâ all the foes of society and thrift
led on by their ablest, most aggressive and most dan
gerous leaders, has been met and utterly routed. It
is a victory which will add to the repute of the State
throughout the Union, strengthen hei prestige and
confirm her prosperity.
The man under whom the conservative elements of
the people have achieved this notable success, so bene
ficial to the general welfare, is well worthy of the
honor. When Mr. Gage entered the canvass he was
a comparatively unknown man to the greater portion
of the people. He had never been an office-seeker.
He had never desired notoriety. He had lived the
life of a hardworking lawyer, and only to his neigh
bors, his clients, the courts and the bar were his splen
did abilities and sterling character known.
As soon as he entered upon the canvass, however,
the force and the charm of his personality were felt.
The people soon came to know him and to recognize
in him the qualities that make up a genuine manhood.
The directness and the earnest sincerity of his
speeches won popular favor. He made friends wher
ever he appeared. His strength increased as the cam
paign progressed, and had the time for the canvass
been longer his majority would have been even larger
than it is.
Many factors have undoubtedly conduced to the
great victory over Maguire and his radical followers,
but it is beyond gainsaying that the personal strength
of Mr. Gage was one of the most potent. With a
leader of less force and capacity the ardor of the
party would not have been so fully aroused; with one
of less integrity of character the independent vote
would not have been so warmly attached to the Re
publican standard. It is, therefore, to a large extent
a Gage victory. The coming Governor has not only
won the honor, but deserved it.
For the commonwealth the victory is a most no
table one. We shall, perhaps, never fully know how
great was the danger that menaced our prosperity in
the Maguire movement We can calculate the injury
that would have been done to land-owners by pre
cipitating a single tax agitation led on by the Gov
ernor and can estimate the evil that would have been
inflicted upon all forms of industry by the election of
an avowed enemy of capital to the position of chief
executive of the State, but the indirect evils resulting
frc>m such agitations and alarms we can never under
take to compute.
Fortunately, the danger is over. The menace has
ceased. Maguireism has been utterly routed. Cali
fornia takes a front place among the great conserva
tive and progressive commonwealths of the Union.
Capital will seek her fields for investment, her labor
will be in demand. She will continue to merit the
title of the Golden State, and her wealth and pros
perity will grow with the years.
BRITISH WOR PREPARATIONS.
â  ZIJ UROPEAN war cloudsâ which, like the poor,
it seems we shall have always with vs â are at
>â * this time somewhat more threatening than
usual. The cause of the new scare is the extraordin
ary activity in the British naval and military depart
ments. This activity has been going on ever since the
announcement of the arrival of a French force of oc
cupation at Fashoda, and, from all reports, has now
reached a considerable magnitude.
If there were any immediate danger of war, how
ever, the British Government would not be the only
one engaged in mobilizing war forces. Some other
nation would also be active in preparing for a con
flict. The fact that all other powers seem to be com
paratively quiet, and are not exerting any extraor
dinary energies in equipping their armies and their
navies, justifies the conclusion that none of them re
gards the British display as a serious menace.
Another explanation than that of imminent war
may be foun4 for the activity of the British War De
partment. It is known that the British, like our
selves, have relied largely upon a force of volunteer
troops for the protection of the empire, and the diffi
culty experienced by the United States in getting
such a force promptly ready for battle last spring
made a profound impression on the British public.
By way of testing their own readiness, the British
Government mobilized an army corps last summer,
and it will be remembered the results were far from
gratifying. It is possible, therefore, that the present
activity may be no more than the performance of
the work necessary to make up the deficiencies in the
service which were shown to exist on that occasion.
It is clear, however, that sooner or later the long
threatening^var cloud must break. The expansive
forces of the great powers are bringing them nearer
and nearer together in Africa and in Asia. The
friction between opposing claims and interests be
comes yearly more pressing and more grinding. Un
less something can be done to relieve the friction, it
is only a question of time when it will cause flames to
burst forth at some point in the world, and from
there it will rapidly spread.
In the meantime the situation, if not dangerous, is
extremely interesting. We have looked for war from
the great military powers of the Czar and the Kaiser,
and not from the country known to the world as a
nation of shopkeepers. Just now, however, the Czar
is working for a conference to arrange for a general
disarmament, and the Kaiser is journeying in the
Holy Land ostensibly in the interests of the Christian
religion, while the commercial British are making a
gigantic display of naval force in every quarter of the
globe.
Whatever may be the motives of these different ac
tions, or whatever may be the results, we will have
good reason to rejoice on our Thanksgiving day that
we are not a part of the European system.
MILES ON THE WAR.
A GENTLEMAN named Miles, having, it is
affirmed, a military reputation, and connected
with the army, has sent a report to the Secre
tary of War concerning a recent misunderstanding
with Spain. Perhaps this is not a presumption on
his part.'
However, there is every reason to suppose that
Miles has compiled his statements without having
once consulted with Richard Haiding Davis. He
has not drawn upon Creelman for facts. Probably he
has failed to include the information that one of
these gentlemen was the ablest tactician in the San
tiago campaign, and that the other did most of the
fighting. Yet do they not modestly acknowledge
this themselves?
It is true that old soldiers laugh at Davis, but old
soldiers grow cynical. It is true, also, that Creelman
has been given more space for idle boasts and self
glorification, founded on fancy alone, than any other
living, lying correspondent. Nevertheless, the two
seem to be regarded as worth consideration, both by
yellow editors of dailies and lead-colored editors of
magazines.
Miles is in a delicate position. Supposing that he
run counter to Davis and Creelman, where will he be
at? Would he not better have permitted them to
write the report for him? Then they would have
been satisfied, even if the rest of the world had to
remain in doubt as to what happened in Cuba.
DANGERS OF IMPERIALISM.
AN apparently well informed writer in the Fort
nightly Review says that the tendency among
the weaker nations of Europe to get rid of
their colonies is caused by a general belief among
them that such possessions are an expensive luxury.
He declares that the real subject matter of the Dela
goa Bay negotiations between Germany and Great
Britain was the relinquishment of all the possessions
of Portugal in African territory, covering an area of
000.000 square miles. The Portuguese Government
is now practically bankrupt, and it can obtain the
money to pay the damages resulting from the Dela
goa Bay arbitration only by selling its African pos
sessions.
"Great Britain and Germany," says the writer re
ferred to, "have become joint heirs to the estates of
the Portuguese crown in Africa, and, while undertak
ing the reversion in common, they have prudently
provided against any clashing of interests when the
time arrives for entering upon their heritage." And
he adds that the Anglo-German agreement covers a
right to pre-empt the various Portuguese colonies,
with the purchase money assigned to each.
The same writer declares that the loss of the Span
ish colonies through the late war with the United
States has produced a decided sense of relief in
Spain. There is now a strong demand for cutting
down the expenses of the army and navy, and the
business men of the kingdom, to say nothing of the
privileged classes, are looking forward with hope to
the time when the country will be free from the
enormous drain which has heretofore crippled the
home government. He also notes the fact that Ital.v
is much gratified at having got out of her disastrous
African colonial venture with a clear skin, and he
doubts very much whether either of these countries
will ever again aspire to colonial empire.
All this is very interesting when considered in
connection with the acquisition by the United States
of Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines. Spain, with
a complete colonial system of government, has made
an abject failure in carrying on the affairs of those
islands. Yet the people of the United States, with
out experience or qualification, and with no idea
whaiever of the work before them, have entered gaily
upon the solution of the great problem. Nobody
seem? to entertain any other idea of the business than
that we shall make a brilliant success in governing
these subject countries, the population of which is
utterly incapable of governing itself.
It would seem that at the present moment there is
great need in this country of a political party which
will set its face strongly against the imperial or ex
pansion policy. The fact is, colonial enterprises de
pend for success upon a thorough naval and civic or
ganization. Great Britain has such an organization,
and she has therefore made a tolerable success of the
business. But in a country like the United States,
where government is conducted solely by consent of
the governed, and where flap-doodle politics and
office-seeking are leading industries, colonial ex
pansion is bound to prove a failure. According to
the writer in the Fortnightly, Spain is glad to get rid
of her colonies. Perhaps before we have had Cuba,
Porto Rico and the Philippines many years we shall
cede them with equal relief. But in the meantime a
great deal of discreditable and humiliating history will
have been made.
RUSSIA'S OLIVE BRANCH-
rROM the first there has been a suspicion that
the olive branch waved by the Czar of all the
Russias is loaded. This is confirmed by the
circumstance that the Czar has about as many sol
diers as anybody to disarm, but keeps right on drill
ing them. He talks peace and acts aggression. # The
bear is trying to coo like a dove, and somehow the
result fails to soothe.
Lately Russia has indicated a willingness to take
the part of Spain in her troubles with this country.
Now, if his game is really the promotion of brotherly
love, the Czar would be wise to have the cards cut
for a new deal. The monarch, as well as the person,
who attends to his own business does much in the
direction of acquiring esteem. If the Czar think to
scare us he has been viewing the United States
through a glass reversed. We are not impressed by
his olive branch, nor do we shudder because it pro
trudes from a rifle.
Now the suspicion concerning the Czar's insincerity
becomes certainty, for he has received the admiration
of Editor Stead of London. "I thank God for him,"
says this journalist. "If that young man is spared he
will go far." Not, we trust, too far. There does not
appear any valid reason for thanking God for the
Czar or for any other potentate. It may be reason
able to express gratitude for the goodness which has
set them at such a distance. Stead seems to be in
that condition best described as "rattled." The Rev.
Dr. Talmage once had the experience of dining at the
palace of Russian royalty, and has been gibbering
about it ever since. Stead, apparently, has been
similarly swelled. He thinks that olive branch is all
right.
An Oakland man who murdered his wife eight
months ago has been brought back from an asylum to
be tried for the offense. He professes to be unable
to recall the deed. The trial should at least be rigid
enough to refresh his memory. However con
scientiously and unknowingly a man may slay his wife
it tends to create the impression that he is not a de
sirable person to be permitted at large.
There are naturally signs of discontent in relation
to army promotions among the Philippine forces.
This is always to be expected. California is not com
plaining much, but does make bold to affirm that her
Colonel Smith of the First deserves to be a general
now.
It seems to be the plan of Spain to charge the
United States a stiff figure for the lodging of troops in
the Philippines. Probably it will next be bringing suit
for damages based on the harm done its boats.
United States war vessels are going to Samoa. Per
haps there will be some objection to this, which is
an excellent reason for sending them.
President McKinley consumed just one minute and
six seconds in voting. Evidently a straight ticket
was good enough for him.
When the Maria Teresa went down it sunk in a
depth of 2600 fathoms. Even Hobson will concede
that it has gone to stay.
Now that the. election is over the** is a chance to
look forward to the next one.

THE OLD RUSTIC BRIDGE.
'Tis just a common rustic bridge,
And spans a common stream;
Where mild-eyed cattle slake their thirst,
And shadows glint and gleam.
The jroldenrod and asters flame
Along the sedgy bank;
The grass is thick, and lush, and green,
The weeds are tall and rank.
But it Is fair, this quiet stream.
Where minnows dart and play:
Where willows droop and blackbirds call
Through all the livelong day.
The planks are old, and gray, and
warped.
The rail is broken down.
But it is dearer far to me
Than any bridge in town.

RULE IN CASINO-J. H. V. D. H.,
City. The rule in the game of casino is
that when the last hand is played it must
be played to a close before a count is
taken, and the one who holds cards is the
first 10 count, and if he has enough points
he wins. In case neither party has cards,
as in a case of tie on the number of cards,
then the one who holds spades counts
first. The order of counting is: Cards,
spades, big casino and tittle casino, aces.
If it is agreed that sweeps shall count,
then they follow aces, According to the
rule, if in a game of thirty points A has
six to go and B has four points, A makes
cards, big casino and one ace, and B
makes spades, little casino and three aces,
A is the winner, as he has the first count,
and having made cards (3), big casino (2)
and an ace (1), he has the requisite num
ber to win.
NOT A LEGAL MARRIAGEâ H. B. 8.,
City. This correspondent writes: "Brown
marries twice. By each union he has
a son. In time the son by the second
wife wishes to marry the daughter of the
flrst wife's son. Would such a marriage
be legal?" It would not be In Califor
nia. The first son born Is Brown No. 1.
the second is Brown No. 2. Those two
are brothers of the half blood. Hair
blood is the relation between persons or
the same father or mother, but not. or
the same father and mother. Brown wo.
1 marries and has a daughter; she be
comes the niece of her father's hair
brother (Brown No. 2>, and as the law
says that uncle and niece cannot marry
in California, such a marriage would De
void. In such a case, the consanguinity
is not as the correspondent suggests,
that of cousins. .He must have got half
brother confused with step-brother.
TWO PARKSâ P. M. d Angels.
Cal. The Yellowstone National Park is
in the northwest corner of Wyoming,
bounded on the north by Montana and

western slope of the Sierra Nevadas, in
Mariposa County, near the center of Cali
fornia. Its location is 155 miles south

COINAGE BY PRIVATE PERSONSâ
Subscriber, City. It was not until the
early part of 1860 that Congress passed a
law prohibiting private individuals from
coining money. The constitution provides
that no State shall coin money, but is
silent as to individuals. In the early part
of the sixties tne attention of becretao
Chase was drawn to the fact that a repu
table firm in Denver, Colo., was coining
money, and when he inquired Into the
matter he was informed by the Attorney
General of the United States that there
was no law against it and that the firm
had a right to coin such. That led to the
passage of the law Prohibiting individuals
from coining money or establishing pri
vate mints.
GLADSTONE-M. R. and others, City.
The following is given as a resume of the

COST OF LIVING ABROAD.
Those people who, from what they have
been told, have formed the impression
that living is cheaper in Europe than in
American might not so hastily jump to
this conclusion if they would follow the
advice of Robert Luce in "Going Abroad,"
and demand that when a man claims that
he has spent less in a year abroad than in
a year at home he shall go into details
as to what he got in return vfor the
money expended. "Ask him if he kept
house"," says Mr. Luce, and "did he have
a bathroom? Was there a range in his
kitchen? Was the house heated by hot
air, hot water or steam? Was it an apart
ment house? Did it have an elevator?
Were there set tubs in the laundry?"
Those questions, it is claimed, are more
than likely to force him to confess that
lie really did lack some of the conveni
ences in Europe which he cannot live
without in America. If interrogated on
the matter of food he will admit that the
European cost has not differed much
from the American. "But." continues the
writer, "ask him about clothing and at
last he will smile triumphantly and tell
you how cheap he bought a suit in Lon
don or gloves in Naples. If, however, you
demand "How did they wear?" and
'How did they fit?' he will evade the ques
tions." In conclusion: "The assertion
that living abroad is cheaper than here is
a half truth, deceptive and dangerous.
Undoubtedly, most Americans who go
abroad live cheaper than at home, but
the reason is simply that they are con
tented with less. From necessity or with
out unhappiness they dispense with many
things that in America they deem indis
pensable either for bodily comfort or to
maintain social position.'
BLACK JACKS. LEATHER BOTTLES.
Sack is ever associated in my mind with
black-jacks, perhaps from the old rhyme:
The great black-jack
Well filled with Sack, etc.
These bombards sometimes held sev
eral gallons. In the inventory of the
goods of Sir John Fastolfe, who died in
1459, are potell bottels, gallon bottels,
quartletts, four "galon pottis of lether"
three "pottelers of lether." etc. The
black-jack made a good tavern sign.
From the window of the Black Jack in
London leaped Jack Sheppard to escape
arrest.
The old festive song, "The Leather Bot
tel," is 200 years old. j\. bottle had a stop
ple; therefore the song asserts the bot
tle's superiority over a jug or black-jack
in these rhymes:
Then what do you say to those black pots
there?
If a man and his wife should not agree,
Why, they'd tug and pull till their liquor doth
spill.
With a leather bottel they may tug their fill,
And pull away till their hearts do ake.
And yet their liquor no harm can take.
So I wish in heaven his soul may dwell.
That first found out the leather bottel.
Black-jacks and leather bottles were
used for a time by the American colo
nists. Governor Winthrop had leather
bottles among his belongings, and he Â»oM
a black-jack to Governor Endicott for Is
6d. In the inventories of the Connecticut
colonists leathern jacks, bottles and cups
are named. But few, however, now are
in existence in America; their bands and
handles of silver have been taken off and
melted and the stout leather vanished.
The two Narragansett survivors are ex
ceptionally good existing examples, and
were exceptionally handsome black-jacks
even in their day and time. Few now
can be found even in England. They were
in use in Winchester College, however,
until the year 1840.â Chap Book.

are known," remarked a man who knows
something about orchard life, "are so
often misleading and out of keeping with
the characteristics and habits of the in
sects that the naturalist feels sometimes
like exclaiming that all popular opinions
are fallacies. There Is the katydid, for
instance. The katydid was named after
his song, presumably; but. as a matter of
fact, the song of the katydid has no more
resemblance to the sound of the > words
than it has to the number pf syllables la
the statement which the insect is sup
posed to iterate so determinedly.
P"lnP "In beginning his song .'or the evening,
the katydid does not say 'katy did at all
Heâ only the males are supplied with the
mSsfcal apparatus-begins the song very
low, very slow, and with a single syllable.
After a time he adds another syllable, and
raises his voice-properly speaking, he
raises his wings, because that s where tne
n Â°'p e reÂ°tty l soon Â°he* increases the volume of
sound and adds still another syllable. It
was at this time, with the accent on the
third and final note, that the or ginal and
superficial observer named the insect the
katydid But the song does not end here,
by any means. More syllables or notes
are added the volume of sound increasing
all the time, until they number seven or
eight Such a number is not alwa> â 
retched, however. The katydid's solo is
a love song. The song stops when it has
served its purpose of attracting a mate.
One may afways tell the approach of the
shy and blushing she-katy by the agita
tion in the note of the wooing male. His
orchestra stops the rhythmic and monot
onous sing-song. It breaks up into short
nervous, staccato notes. He no' longer
plays 'katy did' or whatever movement
in the upward scale he was engaged
upon. lie stops suddenly and begins
something like this: 'Kate! Oh Kate!
Katy! Katy, Katy. Katy!' If the slen
der Katherine is true to the instincts of
her sex, and for the proper period re
mains coy, the gentleman will, perhaps,
pursue her. Perhaps, on the other hand,
he will sulk. That usually has the effect
of bringing about a definite understand
ing. It may be that she rejects him ab
solutely, and, merely to prove that he
does not care a straw, he will reflect upon
the other pebbles, and once more take up
his chant. .
"The people living in the country have a
great deal of faith in the katydid as a
prophet. He begins his song, they say,
exactly six weeks before the first frost-
This Is another popular opinion gone
broke. The Katydid is an Irish prophet
he prophesies backward. His song begins
after the last frost.
"The song of the katydid is, properly
speaking, not a song at all. It is an in
strumental solo. His musical apparatus
is at the base of his wings, and it is as
curiously constructed as some of those
mysterious instruments of a Wagnerian
orchestra, about which one always won
ders what it would be like if somebody
tried to play a solo on it. The katydid's
method seems to be a cross between the
method of the bass violist and the man
with the big drum. He scrapes with his
legs and beats with his wings, and if he
corresponded in size with a human or
chestra he would be capable of rendering
life unfit to live in a place of the size of
New York State."â New York Sun.

ELECTIONS IN THE EAST
VICTORY FOR
REPUBLICANS IN
SEVERAL STATES
Successful F^ght Waged Against
Cro^erism iQ New
YorK-
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt Elected and â¢ thje
Legislature of the Empire State
Is Also Safe.
NEW YORK, Nov. 8. â To-day's elec
ire a general victory for the Re
publicans. A successful fight against
rism was wuged in New York,
: toosevelt's election is indicated by
a majority of about 20,000. Congress
will be Republican, but by a narrow
majority in the House of Representa
tives. In the Senate the Republicans
will have a majority of six.
At midnight the returns indicate that
the Republicans have carried New
York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Mas
sachusetts, New Hampshire, Michigan,
West Virginia, Illinois, Maryland,
Rhode Island, New Jersey and Cali
fornia.
The Democrats have carried Ne
braska, Virginia, Minnesota, North
:na and Texas, and the Populists
have won in Kansas.
The next New York Legislature will
Mean by about twenty on
t, thus assuring the election
of a Republican successor to United
Bitor Murphy. .
1 the country at large the Repub
a have scored many successes and
several reverses. While they
will control the United States Senate
â¢ . have probably lost control of the
House, which is very close. It will
probably be safe for sound money with
the .aid of gold Democratic votes. Ac
cording to the latest returns from Con
gressional districts throughout the
country the Republicans are certain of
a good working majority in the Senate
of the Fifty-sixth Congress, while the
House will be very close between the
Republicans and the allied opposition.
These are the figures for each House
of the new Congress as shown by the
latest returns received from all States:
Senate â Republicans 50, Democrats
vcrites 6. Populists 5, indepen
dent, 1.
Houseâ Republicans 174, Democrats
167, Populists 5, fusionists 3, Silverites 8.
In the present House of Representa
tive?; the Republican majority is fifty-
â even.
/ In to-day's election they lost In the
. t on account of the return of thou
sands of gold Democrats to the regular
organization, and they made slight
gains in the West on account of the
breaking up of the Populist forces and
of the popularity of the President's pol
:' territorial expansion in that sec
tJct of the country.
â¢id-money Democrats In the "West
also voted with the Republicans more
generally than in the East, as the
financial issue was made more promi
nent in the campaign in the West.
The Republican control of both
houses means Congressional support for
the President in dealing with the terri
tory acquired from Spain in the war.
It also means that the Republican
party will be able to carry through the
currency and bank reform measures.
At any rate, there can be no free sil
ver legislation, for even if revised re
turns should deprive the Republicans
of the control of the House, the strong
Ijlican majority in the Senate
Â«ould make the House powerless to en
act the silver law, even if the sound
money Democrats could not be depend
â¢ 1 upon to act with the Republicans in
sition to the silver forces.
All the Democrats elected ran as
r. â minces of the regular organization.
Efforts to obtain pledges from some of
them on the money question during the
' i?nj;aign were fruitless, but there are
i:a.stern States who can be depended
upon to aid in defeating proposed silver
aion, even if they will not help
the banking and currency law.
The Democratic vote in Greater New
V rk proved a disappointment to the
friends of Judge Van Wyck. In round
imbers the greater city gives Van
80,000 more votes than Colonel

! party. Governor Wolcott's plurality
I will be 70,000 to $0,000. Returns in Con
j necticut show that George E. Louns-
I bury, Republican candidate for Gov
â  ernor, has defeated the Democratic
! nominee, Daniel M. Morgan, by a ma
| jority of about half that of 1596. Re
i publicans have carried all of the four
Congressional districts in the State.
New Jersey elected Foster M. Voor
hees (R.) to the governorship for three
, a Republican Senate and Assem
bly to elect a successor to James Smith
Jr. in the United States Senate, and six
of the eight members of Congress.
Pennsylvania +ias been carried by the
Republicans by a plurality not much
short of 100,000. Returns have come
in slowly from cities in the State, but
State Chairman John P. Elkin claimed
at 1 o'clock to-night that enough
has been received to bear out his pre
diction made Sunday night that Stone
would be elected Governor by 131,000
plurality.
At Democratic State headquarters the
election of the Republican State ticket
was conceded, but no figures were given
out. The Republicans will have a large
majority in the State Legislature, and
Senator Quay will doubtless be his own
successor.
The Renublicans have elected their
entire Ohio State ticket by pluralities
ranging from 25,000 to 45,000. and get
eighteen of twenty-one Congressmen.
These figures were given out at State
headquarters at midnight, and are con
ceded practically as correct by th*
Democrats.
Indications are that the Illinois Re
publican State ticket is elected by a
plurality of 25.000 or 30.000, although
scores of districts have not reported at
all either on the State Legislature or
Congressional tickets. That Republi
cans will lose several Congressmen is
conceded, and indications are that they
will lose three and possibly four in
Cook County. The Legislature will be
Republican byb v good working majority
in both branches.
North Dakota returns indicate the
election of B. F. Spaulding. Republican,
to Congress over A. M. Creel, fusion, by
3500 plurality. The Republican State
ticket, headed by F. B. Fansher for
Governor, is probably elected.
Incomplete returns indicate the elec
tion in Kansas of the entire State ticket
I d by John W. Leedy also the
election of five out of eight Populist
Representatives.
Election returns from Minnesota are
â¢ music to Democratic ears to
night for the first time in forty years.
That John Lind is elected Governor
is quite obvious from figures already
in. He has certainly carried Minne
apolis and returns so far indicate that
he has perhaps 10,000 plurality in St.
Paul. Winona, Stillwater, St. Cloud
and Duluth have also gone for the
Democratic candidate. Republicans
elect Tawney in the First District; Mc-
Cleary in the Second; Stevens in the
Fourth and Fletcher in the Fifth by
6000. The Seventh has gone for Ring
dal (Dem.) and the Third and Sixth are
in doubt.
The probabilities are that trie Demo
crats of Wyoming have elected the
Governor and the Republicans the bal
ance of the State ticket, Congressmen
and Legislature.
Pingree is re-elected Governor of
Michigan and ten out of twelve Repub
lican Congressmen are elected.
The Silver forces of Nebraska have
carried everything they expected to
carry, and, while there have been no
positive gains as far as can be defi
nitely ascertained to-nigrht, indications
are clear that any changes are in favor
of the fusion candidates.
The result of the election in North
Carolina is such as to surprise even the
most sanguine Democrats. The Demo
cratic State Chairman said to-night:
"We have the State by not less than
25,000 majority. The indications are
that we have elected seven or eight of
the nine Congressmen. White (R.) is
elected in the Second District, and pos
sibly Linney in the Eighth. The Re
publicans and Populists at their re
spective headquarters admitted that
there was a landslide.
Maryland fiirni.shed some surprises.
It was confidently expected that the
Republicans would carry five out of the
six districts. Instead they carry four,
and barely save one of these by 72 plu
rality.
The Democrats have carried Missouri
by an old-time majority. Chairman
Cook of the State Central Committee
estimates that the plurality will be 40,
000. The Legislature will be Democratic
by a good working majority, and Sena
tor Franc-is M. Cockrell will be elected to
succeed himself. There Is no opposition
to him. Thirteen of the fifteen new
Congressmen will be Democrats.
The Republican vote has falkn off
everywhere in West Virginia, but in
some sections the Democrats have sus
tained losses. In the First District
Dovener, Republican, seems to be
elected by perhaps 1500. In the Second
Me' 'raw. Democrat, has mad*- some re
markable sairs. The Fourth is very
with Neal, Democrat, showing
small' gai'is.
The Democrats have carried all of the
ten Congressional districts in Virginia.
Chairman Treat of the Republican
State Central Committee figures that
Scofleld (R.). for Governor f Wiscon
sin will carry the State by 40,000 plu
rality and claiming the Legislature
will be largely Republican and at least
eight of the ten Representatives will be
the Republicans will carry
the State by about 50.000 and elect the
entire Congressional delegation.
The Democratic State ticket was
elected without opposition in South
Carolina. , . ,
Little interest was taken in the elec
COLONEL THEODORE ROOSEVELT, Governor-Elect of New York,
tion in Utah. Returns indicate the
election of Roberts (D.) to Congress by
1000. Silver was not so grewt an issue
as in 1896, as each of the three parties
adopted a free coinage platform. The
Democrats, .with eight hold-over Sena
tors, will probably have 45 out of 63
members of the Legislature.
Democrats swept everything before
them in Louisiana. The Republicans
were not even able to make it interest
ing. In addition to six Representatives
in Congress, three Railroad Commis
sioners, all Democrats, were elected.
NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, Nov. B.â Theodore
Roosevelt, Republican, late colonel of
the First United States Volunteer Cav
alry, has been elected Governor of this
State by a plurality anywhere from
18,000 to 20,000.
All Colonel Roosevelt's associates on
the Republican State ticket are prob
ably elected with him. The returns both
from Greater New York and from the
counties outside of this municipality
are incomplete, but enough has been
received to indicate a heavy falling off
in the vote up the State, while that in
cities was well sustained.
The consequence is a falling off in the
Republican plurality in the State from
212,000 to the approximated figures
given above. Outside of Creator New
York the vote for Van Wyck is only
about one-fifth of one per cent above
that of Porter in 1896. There appears
to be a loss of four Republican Con
gressmen in the Brooklyn district, the
Second, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth; and
Congressman Quigg who had a major
ity of about 9000 at the election last
year, has been defeated by William
Astor Chanler. In the Albany district,
the Twentieth, Glynn, Democrat, has
been elected to succeed Southwick, Re
publican.
In. addition to the foregoing there are,
seemingly, Democratic gains in the
Eighth and Thirteenth districts, both
in this city, Daniel J. Riordan bein?
elected in the one and Jefferson M.
Levy in the other. This makes a total
Democratic gp.in of seven Congressmen.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â Returns re
ceived in the Associated Press office in
this city from all over the country up
to 12:30 o'clock this morning indicate
that 85 Republicans and 109 Democrats
have certainly been elected to seats in
the national House of Representatives.
The =ame districts two years ago iv
turned to the lower House of Congress
IQJS Republicans and 89 Democrats.
â¢ id solely upon the estimates in
these districts a Republican loss of 20
and a Democratic gain of 21 Is indi
cated. These eHti mates concede to the
Democrats all of the Congressional dis
tricts in Greater New York except one,
the Fifteenth.
MASSACHUSETTS.
BOSTON, Nov. B.â The Republicans
have again carried Massachusetts and
elected Roger Wolcott Governor for the
fourth time, as well as the entire State
ticket by a safe majority.
Governor Wolcott's plurality over A.
L. Bruce, his Democratic opponent, will
be about 70,000, or 13,000 less than his
lead last election. The vote, this year
was much heavier than In 1597, and Mr.
Bruce made substantial gains over
George Fred Williams, the Democratic
candidate last year. As in the past two
years, Wolcott succeeded in carrying
Boston, which is usually a Democratic
city.
Nearly all the interest in the cam
paign was confined to the Fifth, Sev
enth, Ninth and Tenth Congressional
districts, and both parties fought; hard
on national issues, but the Republicans
lost two. if not three, of their districts.
However, with the assistance of a
strong Independent Democratic candi
date the Ninth District remained Dem
ocratic and returned John F. F'tz^er
ald fur the third time, while the Tenth
District went Democratic and the Fifth
District was in doubt for some time.
The Eighth District, which was con
sidered doubtful, remained in the He
publican ranks and elected Ernest W.
Roberts.
The Legislature will be bun little
changed from its present list, narao)?
ISI Republicans, 59 Democrats, and '.he
Governor's Council will also stand T he
same as last yearâ seven Republicans
to one Democrat.
ILLINOIS.
CHICAGO, Nov. B.â Five and prob
ably six Congressmen have been gained
in Illinois by the Democrats, and the
next Congressional delegation from
this State is likely to be evenly divided,
eleven Democrats and eleven Republi
cans. It is possible for the Republicans
to have twelve of the twonty-two Con
gressmen, for all the returns are not yet
In, but the indications are for an even
split on the delegation..
The entire Republican State ticket is
elected by over 30,000 plurality. In
Cook County the vote has been very
close, the Republicans carrying the
county and the Democrats the city of
Chicago. The Democratic plurality in
the city is about 3000, and the Republi
can plurality about the same in the
county. __ â .
Â«
MICHIGAN.
DETROIT, Nov. B.â Governor Pin
gree held his own tolerably well in to
day's election. At 10 o'clock to-night
the Republican State Committee
claimed his election by from 50,000 to
60.000 majority. The Democratic State
Committee do not yet concede defeat.
The Governor ran several hundred
ahead of his ticket in Detroit, and ran
up a plurality of 2000 in Grand Rapids.
In Saginaw he doubled on his plurality
of 1896. In Jackson, Lansing, Bay City
and other smaller cities he was cut con
siderably, but the country districts sur
rounding went uuite strongly fcr him.
The balance of the Republican State
ticket is elected.
The upper peninsula gave its usual
Republicn majority, but there was a
great amount of splitting on Governor
in the lower peninsula. The vote on
Congressmen is close in half of the
twelve districts, the others returning
Republicans with certainty.
The Legislature will have a Repub
lican majority, but whether Pingree or
anti on the equal taxation issue is as
yet undetermined.
NEW JERSEY.
TRENTON. N. J., Nov. B.â New Jer
sey has been carried by the Republi
cans, and Foster M. Voorhees, the Re
publican candidate, is elected Governor
by about 12,000 plurality. Essex Coun
ty, which wa? conceded as the fighting
r.d of both parties, has gone Re-
I publican by about 9000, and both houses
of the Legislature will be Republican.
This will insure the election of a Re
publican to succeed James Smith Jr.
(D.) in the United States Senate.
Ex-Congrossman Kean is conceded
to be the choice of the Republicans as
Senator Smith's successor. The Demo
crats have elected two of the eight Con-
I gressmen â Salmon in the Fourth and
| Daly in the Seventh. The Senate will
: stand 14 Republicans to 7 Democrats.
! The Assembly will probably stand 40
Republicans and 20 Democrats. This
is allowing to the Republicans the two
from Middlesex County, which is very
close.
MARYLAND.
BALTIMORE, Nov. B.â Full and
semi-official returns from the city of
Baltimore and partial returns from the
balance of the State make it reason
ably certain that Maryland has re
1 turned four Republicans and two Dem
| ocratic Congressmen, after an extraor
| dinarily close but entirely listless
j election. This Is a Democratic gain of
i two.
The Democrats succeeded in obtaln
: ing a majority of the popular vote in
j Baltimore city for the first time in yix
: yearo and there is but little doubt they
would have sent five Congressmen to
I the next national legislature if an ac
; tive and aggressive campaign had been
i made. The entire delegation, with the
: exception of Messrs. Mudd and Baker,
are new timber and are looked upon
as favoring a gold standard of cur
rency.
KENTUCKY.
LOUISVILLE, Nov. B.â The Demo
j crats of Kentucky to-day carried nine
! and possibly ten of the eleven Con
! gressional districts in the State â a gain
; of two or perhaps three over their last
delegation. The Republicans carried
only one district, the Eleventh, solidly,
but this was always conceded by their
! opponents, as it has been a Republican
: stronghold for years. In the Ninth
< District the race between Pugh (R.)
! and Williams (D.) is very close, both
' sides claiming it. The Republicans in
S the Fifth (Louisville) District talk of
j contesting the election of Turner (D.).
The vote throughout the State was the
lightest known in years.
NEBRASKA.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Nov. B.â Scattering
precinct returns up to midnight mdi
I cate a political surprise in Nebraska,
I inasmuch as they forecast the almost
j certain election of Hayward (R.) for
I Governor by a plurality of not less than
i 3000. This will be a reversal of the
verdict of 1896 by nearly 15,000. The
count thus far is wholly on Governor,
so far as the State ticket is concerned,
and it is the belief that Hayward is
running slightly ahead of his ticket,
which makes the results on remaining
State offices very close. The most sur
prising feature of it all is the strength
displayed by Republican legislative
candidates, the full returns received
showing them to be even ahead of Hay
ward. As these are from but one or
two counties, however, they fail to in
dicate ansuredly the complexion of the
Legislature.
At midnight, Chairman Slaughter of
the Republican State Committee said:
"We have elected the entire Republican
ticket by pluralities of not lees than
3000, and possibly to exceed 5000. We
will have a majority of the Legisla
ture on Joint ballot and will elect a
Republican United States Senator to
succeed Senator Allen. We have elected
three Congressmen and probably four
of the six."
The fusion committee made no state
ment, further than to insist that they
had carried the State and Legislature.
One hundred and thirty-two precincts
outside of Lincoln and Omaha show a
net Republican gain of 2132.
Lincoln and Lancaster counties show
a Republican gain (estimated) of 600.
Chairman Slaughter says the average
Republican gain to the precinct is 10.
A gain of 6 to the precinct would mean
Republican success.
INDIANA.
INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. B.â At mid
night only about 220 precincts out of
3259 have been heard from, no one
county having reported in full. Re
turns come in slowly, and both parties
claim the State. Chairman Martin of
the Democratic Committee, expresaes
himself as confident that the Demo
cratic State ticket is elected by about
15,000 majority, together with a major
ity of the Legislature. The Republican
chairman makes the same claim for his
side.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 9.â At 1
o'clock this morning Chairman Martin
of the Democratic State Committee
said the returns were not as yet suffi
ciently complete to determine as to
the State. The Republicans have prob
ably elected in the Sixth. Eighth,
Tenth, Eleventh and First districts,
though the last is not conceded. The
Democrats claim the Second. Third,
Fourth, Fifth. Seventh, Ninth, Twelfth
and Thirteenth districts. The Legisla
ture is still in doubt. It will be impos
sible to give reliable figures on the
State, Congress or Legislature until to
morrow. Both parties claim all three.

MINNESOTA.
ST. PAUL, Nov. B.â The result in
Minnesota is very much in doubt, but
at midnight the State is being placed in
the Democratic column, at least so far
as the Governor is concerned. Eustis,
the Republican candidate, ran behind
his ticket in most of those precincts
where the vote on all the candidates
has been given, so that the fact that
much fuller returns will be needed to
decide between the gubernatorial can
didates is looked on as presumptive
evidence that the rest of the Republi
can ticket is probably elected. The
Legislature, which will elect a suc
cessor to Senator Davis, is concededly
Republican. The Republicans have
certainly elected four Congressmen.
the other three being doubtful rather
than positively Democratic. In fact,
the Democrats have about abandoned
their claim that Heatwole is defeated
by their candidate in the Third, whin
some of the later returns from the
Sixth and Seventh districts are very
favorable to Morris and Eddy.
MISSOURI.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 9.â Up to 1 a. m. re
turns from both the city of St. Louis
and State of Missouri were far from
complete. At Democratic headquarters
incomplete returns from 40 out of 114
counties in the State seemed to indi
cate that the Democratic majority on
the State and Congressional tickets of
1896 would be equaled. The claim was
made that success in the doubtful
counties of Butler, Carroll and Scot
land and the election of five additional
Democratic Representatives in St.
Louis, with Senatorial gains else
where, insured a larger majority in the
State Legislature for the Democrats
than they had two years ago.
Richard Bartholdt (R.), Tenth Con
gressional District, is undoubtedly
elected, but the Eleventh and Twelfth
districts are in doubt and claimed by
both parties. The other thirteen Con
gressional districts are probably Dem
ocratic, but it will take complete re
turns to settle this.
WYOMING.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Nov. 9.â The fol
lowing signed statements of the politi
cal situation were handed the corres
pondents of the Associated Press at
11:45 o'clock to-night:
Returns are coming in very slowly,
twenty precincts only have been heard
from "including four in the city of Chey
enne They show heavy Republican gains
over 1896 for Mondell for Congress and
the State ticket Is running with Mondell,
excepting that Richards (R.), for Gov
ernor is running slightly behind his ticket
in this (Laramie) county, where there is
a slis'nt falling off. Indications are that
Mondial is elected by a large plurality
and that the entire State ticket is elected
by smaller Pluralities.^ ORgDELL

The Democratic party will elect the en
tire State and Congressional tickets with
majorities ranging between 700 jmd 1800.

CONNECTICUT.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. B.â The
result of the election in this State to
day was a victory for the Republican
ticket. Complete returns from
sixty-five towns of 106 in the State
give Lounsbery (R.). 75,057; Morgan
(D.), 5.H.406.
The same towns in 1896 gave Cooke
(R.). 100.999; Sargent (D.), 51,396.
The majorities of candidates on the
State ticket will average fully 15,000.
The Republican candidates appear to
have suffered most from the general de
crease in the vote, but no particular
dissatisfaction can be said to be shown
by the general result. The only real
contest was in the Second District,
where Congressman Sperry, the Re
publican nominee, and James H. Webb
were the opposing candidates. Sperry's
majority will be about 3325.
Returns indicate that the Republi
cans will have a majority of at least
fifty in the General Assembly.
WASHINGTON.
TACOMA, Nov. 9.â Returns received
by the Ledger from all over the State
indicate a great Republican landslide.
The Populist counties east of the moun
tains have turned completely over. In
dications at thisrhour (1 a. m.) are that
F W Cushman and W. L. Jones (Rep.)
are elected to Congress by at least 2500
plurality, as against about 12.000 fu
sion plurality two years ago. The
Legislature "will be Republican and
elect a Republican Senator to succeed
Senator Wilson.

Chairman Babcocl^ of the Republican National
Comn)ittee Says It May Depend
Upon California.
5 Special Dlapetch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Nov. 9.
Indications at 1:30 o'clock are that
the Republicans have lost control of
the House. Chairman Babcock of the
Republican National Committee will
not concede this, however. He says the
result is very close, and returns from
the far "West are anxiously awaited. At
this hour nothing definite has been re
ceived from California.
"The returns from California may
change the situation," said Mr. Bab
cock.
"Is the result so close that the com
plexion of the next House hinges upon
California's vote?" he was asked.
"Yes; it is Just that close. We have
not heard much definite news from In
diana yet, either, and several other
Western States are to be heard from
before we will concede any thing."
At the Democratic Congressional
Committee, Chairman Kerr claims that
186 Democrats have been elected, a gain
of thirty-nine. The present Republi
can majority Is fifty. so that twenty-six
Democratic gains would give the Dem
ocrats control of the House. Chairman
Kerr claims the following Democratic
gains: Alabama 2, Illinois a, Indiana 1,
Kentucky 3, Massachusetts 2. Missouri
2, New Jersey 2, New York 7, North
Carolina 6, Pennsylvania 4, Virginia 2,
West Virginia 1.
He asserts that Democrats have been
elected to succeed Aldrich and Howard
of Alabama; Mills, White, Boutell and
Fuss of Illinois; Henry U. Johnson of
Indiana; Evans, Davidson and Pugh
uf Kentucky; Barrows of Massachu
setts; Joy and Pearce of Missouri; Pit
nev and McEwan of New Jt-rsey; Hur
ley Howe, Mitchell, Shannon, Quigg,
Lowe and Southwick of New York:
Barber and Mclntyre of Maryland;
Skinner, White, Fowler, Strowd, Mar-
Un and Linney of North Carolina;
Kirkpatrick, Brumm, Kulp and Stone
uf Pennsylvania; Walker and Yost ot
Virginia, and Dayton of West Virginia.
While no one at Republican head
quarters is willing to concede that the
Democrats will organize the House,
some conservative members of the com
mittee admit the indications are that
the Republicans will lose control, but
claim the fusionists will hold the bal
ance of power. Neither does Demo
cratic Chairman Kerr make a positive
declaration that the Democrats will
have control of the lower house.
"The chances are altogether that
way " said he, "but in order to be on
the safe side I will say it is certain that
the Republicans have lost it. We K>e
iieve we will have about twelve ma
jority over both Republicans and Pop
ulists." . ._.
At 12 o'clock to-night one of the
White House attaches wired President
McKinley at Tyrone, Pa:
"The indications are the Republicans
have lost control of the House. The
result is very close with the probabili
ties that the Populists may hold the
balance of power in that body."

PORTALS OF TUNNEL
THIRTEEM CAVE IN
Blocking of Traffic Because of the
Fire Near Truckee Will Be Very
Serious.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. B.â Thero has been
a cave-In at both portals of tunnel 13,
near TrucÃee. where the flr^ occurred Sun
day night. Owing to the smoke and heat
arising from the burning- timbers inside,
which at one time supported the tunnel,
it is impossible for any one to enter and
ascertain how great the damage has
been. At frequent intervals there have
been heard sounds as of the falling- of
heavy masses of earth and rock.
It is therefore feared that there
have been many serious cave-ins through
out the tunnel. If this is found to be the
case the blocking of traffic will be very
serious.
To-day the yards at Reno and Truckee
; have been filling up with loaded and
| empty cars. A number of carloads of
; Government mules, the cars marked
i "Hurry Up," are sidetracked at Reno.
: These mules are intended for shipment
on the next expedition to Manila, but are
: likely to eat their heads off at the expense
j of the Southern Pacific before embarking
on th< ir voyage to the tropic seas.
A trail has been built over the mountain
; through which tunnel 13 runs, and passen
j gvrs are transferred over this trail on
To-day's morning and evening west
j bound trains have been combined, and
passengers will reach San Francisco at
an early hour to-morrow morning.
Railroad officials say that it may lie
possible that the lire, which is still smol
i dering in the tunnel, will have so far died
: down as to admit of an exploration by
i to-morrow afternoon. Until then it will
be impossible to pay when traffic will
be resumed. The damage may be so great.
as to require a week or two to repair it,
while again it may be of such a nature
that it can be repaired in a few days.
The tunnel is 900 feet long.
HEAVY SNOWSTORMS
THROUGHOUT ALASKA
Four Hundred Persons Stalled by the
"Beautiful" at Lake Linde

PORT TOWNSJJND, Nov. B.â The |
City of Topeka arrived last night from :
Alaska, bringing 124 passengers. She !
reports that heavy snowstorms have ;
visited various sections of Alaska, and t
nearly all mining operations have been j
suspended, except quartz mills located
near tidewater. On November 2 four
feet of snow fell on Chilcoot and White
passes, which completely put a stop
to travel.
Telephone messages from Lake Lin
deman to Skaguay announce that about
400 persons are snowbound there.
Another rich strike is reported from :
the head of the Salmon River, below
Quiet Lake.
According to John Olds, a pioneer I
mining and business man of |
SOOO claims have been tiled and re
corded in the Atlin mining district and
about 1000 men will winter there. He
predicts that Atlin will have a popula
tion of at least 15,000 and that the out
put of gold will nearly if not quite
equal that of Dawson.
It is stated that an English syndicate
has bought up about 4200 acres of
placer ground in the Atlin district.

WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â <\ P. Ttunting
ton was in Washington Monday and called
on President McKlnley. He said he was

ury, Secretary of the Interior and the !
Attorney General. Under the terms of the i
act of Congress, some kind of settlement
must be made within one year from the j
date of the passage of the act or the debt
must be foreclosed. This amendment was ]
adopted by Congress at Congressman
Barnam's suggestion. Six months of that

BABE STRANGLED BY

Evidence of a Horrible Crime Cast
Upon : the Beach at Crescent
%Â£i: City.
CRESCENT CITY, Nov. The atten
tion of employes on the wharf was di
rected last evening to an object on the
beach near by, where sea gulls were hov
ering. They found that the scavenger
birds had commenced to mutilate the
nude remains of a male infant that had
washed upon the sand during the night
or early morning. Coroner El well was
notified and the body was taken to the
Morgue.
A post mortem examination disclosed
the fact that the child had met its death
by strangulation prior to its being placed
In the -water. It was a remarkably large
infant, and, though disfigured to some ex
tent by the birds, its light blue eyes and
well turned features made it especially
beautiful. "
An inquest failed to elicit any informa
tion as to the identity of the mother who"
thus disposed of her offspring. The only
clew to the mystery ,-4 f indeed it may be
regarded :as a clew, is the strip of thin
curtain with which the innocent little
creature was choked to death, which was
found still intact around its neck - where
the villainous hands had placed it.

The sale of the City Hall site is now

gether too valuable for the purpose to
which it is now put. There is no need
I to have a free library, fire engine house
and a prison on ground that is worth'
nearly SISCM) a foot frontage. Thirty years
ago, when 1 sold that block of land to
j the city, there were many who said that
it would never be more valuable than it
j was then, and thought we were asking a
] fabulous price for it. Now the Mayor as-
I sures me that he has a genuine offer of
(600,000 for the lot that we sold for $17,500.
The City Hall could, with advantage, be
moved sever;:! blocks from where it now
is. and at the same time Oakland could
j acquire the Adams Point property with-
I out any bonding proposition."
Many of the most prominept people
! have expressed their views in regard to
j the sale of the City Hall site, and the
I great majority are in favor of carrying
i out the plan suggested by the Mayor.
HELD UP BY FOOTPADS.
John W. Winkler Assailed on His
Way Home and Relieved of $64.
OAKLAND, Nov. S.â John W. Winkler,
a carpenter, while on his way home at
about 6:30 o'clock to-night was held up by

According to his story, rs told to the
police, the footpads were the conventional
tall and short man. The former wore a
dark suit, while the short man was
dressed in gray. Both wore masks.
As Winkler was leisurely strolling along
the tall man accosted him, ordering him
to throw up his hands at the point of a
revolver. Winkler promptly obeyed the
order, and, after the short man had re
lieved him of his $i".4. be took to his heels.
He says he was to badly frightened he
would be unable to Identify his assail

BACHELORS BOYCOTTED.
Marriageable Misses of the Encinal
Ostracise the Members of an
Anti-Nuptial Club.
ALAMEDA. Nov. B.â The marriageable
misses of Alameda have boycotted the
members of the Bachelors' Club. This
organization was formed recently and
those connected with it entered into a
contract not to become benedicks for at
least twelve months, nor to encourage any
matrlmonial measures. There is hardly
a dozen members, and if the Intentions of
the young ladies are carried out to the
letter the bachelors will be forced to form
a set entirely their own, for the pro
gramme is to ostracise them.
The first sign of hostilities was mani
fested when the Encinal Recreation
Club, of which the bachelors are mem
bers, announced a promenade. The young
ladiefl of this city presented their ulti
matum at once. The word went forth
that unless the anti-marrying dozen were
put in a room by themselves apart from
the promenaders who have matrimonial
inclinations. the marriageble misses
would not attend the .function.
The directors agreed to put the bachel
ors in the handball court, where they will
be exhibited as curios and subjected to
the taunts and jeers of the ladies during
the progress of the concert. They will,
no doubt, be severely punished.
In addition to their other miseries the
secretary of the Bachelors' Club has re
ceived a letter signed by the young ladies
of AJameda, in which the writers pray
thnt members of the proscribed organiza
tion change their compact so that their
state of bachelorhood will be extended
from a year to life. "There are others,"
write the girls. The officers of the Bach
elors 1 Club are Dr. W. R. Hughes, presi
dent: Clyde Conkey, secretary, and 11. L.
Zimmerman, treasurer.

THAT COMMON TROUBLE. ACID DYS-
PEPSIA, OR SOUR STOMACH.
Now Recognized as a Cause of Serious
Disease.
Acid dyspepsia, commonly called
heartburn or sour stomach, is a form of
indigestion resulting from fermenta-
tion of the food. The stomach beine too
weak too promptly digest it. the food
remains until fermentation begins, fill-
ing the stomach with gas and a bitter,
sour, burning taste in the mouth is of-
ten present. This condition soon be-
comes chronic, and being an every day
occurrence is given but little attention.
Because dyspepsia is not tmmediatelv
fatal, many people do nothing for the
trouble.
Within a recent period a remedy has
been discovered prepared solely to cure
dyspepsia and stomach troubles. It is
known as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
and is now becomine rapidly used and
prescribed as a radical cure for everv
form of dyspepsia.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have been
placed before the and are sold by
druggists everywhere at 50 cents per
package. It is prepared by the Stuart
Chemical Co., Marshall, Mich., and
while it promptly and effectually re-
stores a vigorous digestion, at the same
time is perfectly harmless and will not
injure the most delicate stomach, but
on the contrary bv giving perfect diges-
tion strengthens the stomach, improves
the appetite and makes life worth liv-
ing.

Mr. Tesia's controlling device may be

than this, assuming that it were
.possible to accurately locate the posi
tion of the vessel which it is desired to
y. the torpedo boat could be di
rected to it, even if the ship lay in the
harbor of Southampton and the opera
tor was stationed at Sandy Hook.
Mr. Tesla says that some months
elapsed since he fully dev
his device, for which he has applied for
a patent. When it was learned thai Ad
miral Cervera was bottled up at Santi
:t was his intention to apply his
anism to several launches and
similar craft loaded with high explo
and to annihilate the fleet at an
chor. Admiral Cervera, however, came
out and met his fate under the guns of

arrangements could be made. Then Mr.
T>-p!a planned a raid on the Spanish

j possibilities of the device, I will now
j give you a practical example of the
workings of the model before going into
a detailed description of how 1 am able
to produce these results."
Elevated on slicks on a table in the.
j center of the laboratory stood a model
I of a screw-propelled craft, about four
j feet long and somewhat disproportion
ately wide and deep. Mr. Tesla ex
plained that it was merely a working
model which he had made in order to
exhibit it to President McKinley, and
that no attempt had been made to fol
low the usual sharp lines of a torpedo
boat. The deck was slightly arched
and surmounted by three slender
standards, the center one being con
siderably higher than the other two,
which carried small incandescent bulbs,
a third bulb being fixed at the bow.
The keel consisted of a massive cop
pel i late, the propeller and' rudder be
' ing in the usual positions. Mr. Tesla
explained that the boat contained the
â  lling machinery, consisting
electric motor actuated by a storage
battery in the hold, another motor to
actuate the rudder and the delicate
mechanism which performs the func
tion of receiving through the central
standard the electric impulses sent
i through the atmosphere from the dis
| tant operating station which set in mo-
I tion the propelling and steering mo
j tors, and ihrough them light or extin-
I guish the electric bulbs and fire the ex
ploding charge in a chamber in the bow
in response to signals sent by the ope
rator.
"Now watch," said the Inventor, and
going to a table on the other side of
the room, on which lay a little switch
board, about five inches square, he gave
the lever a sharp turn. Instantly the
little bronze propeller began to revolve
at a furious rate.
"Now I will send the boat to star
board," he said, and another quick
movement of the' lever sent the helm
sharp over, and another movement
i turned it as rapidly back again. At an
; other signal the screw stopped and re
versed.
"During the day," continued Mr.
: Tesla, his hand on the lever, "we should
j steer our course by keeping the two
I standards in line, but at night we
I should depend upon the electric iights,
which would, of course, be screened so
| as not to be visible to the enemy," and
\ at a signal both the tiny bulbs were il
| luminated.
"Now we will assume that tho boat
I has arrived withi.i striking distance of
the vessel to be destroyed and the bulb
in the bow will serve to show that the
explosion has taken place."
As he spoke he touched the lever
I again and the light flashed and was ex-
I tinguished.
"Imagine, if you can." said Mr. Tesla,
as he went back to his desk, "what an
irresistible instrument of destruction
we have in a torpedo boat thus con
tr lied, which we can operate day or
night, on the surface or below it and
from any distance that may be desired.
A ship thus assailed would have no pos
sible show of escape.
"I can apply this system of control to
any type of vessel and any one of any
size. It is not even necessary to make
a close approach to be destroyed. At
j the distance of 100 feet the explosion
; of ?00 pounds of dynamite will exert a
I shattering effect on a battleship, but
| there is no reason w>Â»~ we should not
I load a. vessel with 200 or 300 tons or
(even more of dynamite, which, explod
: ed even a mile or so way would raise
a wave that would overwhelm the big
si ship ever built."
Continuing his description, Mr. Tosla
s.i id :
"As to that part of my invention
which involves the production of .suit
able wave? or radiations and the con
veying of the same to a remote re
ceiving apparatus capable of being: op
erated or controlled by their influence,
it may be carried out in various ways
which are at the present time more or
less understood. For example, I may
pass through a conducting path, pre
ferably enclosing a lurgv area, a rapid
ly varying- current and by electro
magnetic induction of the same affect
a circuit carried by a moving body.
"In this case the action at a given
distance will be the stronger the larger
the area Inclosed by the conductor and
the greater the rate of change of the
:;t. if the latter were generated
in the ordinary ways the rate of change
and consequently the distance at which
the action would be practically avail
able for the present purpose, would be
very small, but by adopting p-ich means
as I have devisedâ that is, cither by
passing through the conducting path
currents of a specially designed high
frequency alternator, or, better still, at
those of a strongly charged condenser â
a very high rate (if charge may be ob
tained, and the effective range of the
influence thus extended over a vasl
area, and by carefully adjusting the
circuit on the moving body so as to be
in exact electro-magnetic synchronism
with the primary disturbances this in
fluence may be utilized at a great dis
tance.
"Another way to carry out my In
vention is to direct the currents <>r dis
charges of a high frequency machine or
condenser through a circuit, one termi
nal of which Is connected directly or in
ductively with thp ground and the
other with a body, preferably of large
surface and at an elevation. In this
if the circuit on the moving body
be similarly arranged or connected, dif
ces of potential on the terminals
of the circuit either by conduction or
electro-static induction are produced
and the same objects attained.
"Still another way is to pass the cur
rents simply through the ground by
connecting both tiu- terminals of the
â  of high frequency currents to
earth at different and remote points
and to utilize the currents spreading
through the ground for affecting the re
ceiving circuit properly placed and ad-
Justed.
"Finally, I may avail myself, in car
rying out my invention, of electrical
oscillations which do not follow any
particuL'tf* conducting path, but propa
gate In straight lines through space, of
rays, waves, pulses or disturbances of
any kind, capable of bringing the
mechanism of the moving body into qc
tion from a distance and at the will of
the operator by their effect upon suita
ble controlling devices."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Nov. 8.-The War Inves
tigating Commission to-day continued
I the examination of witnesses. General
Dodge, chairman of the committee,
says that he can begin to see an end
of the long investigation. After some
evidence has been heard at Detroit the
members of the committee will go to
j Washington. They have yet to visit
Camp Meade, Pa., but it is likely that
this camp will not be reached until
after the return to Washington.
According to Dr. Connor, the accu
mulation of papers and documents in
the possession of the commission would
fin a large-sized room.
Dr. <>. A. Smith of Clinton, la-, was
the first witness to-day. From Au
gust 9 to September 10 he was in
charge of the Second Division Third
Army Corps hospital at Camp Thomas.
Dr. Smith said: "When I assumed
my duties, July 14, I found a shortage
of tents and cots. The patients in the
hospital were crowded on account of
tent shortage. Some of the patients
were lying on the ground on account of
lack of cots. There* was no provision
made for feeding the sick other than
the rations issued io the soldiers in
the regular service, except for such
food as was brought in by charitable
organizations, the principal of which
were the Red Cross Society and the
National Relief.
"In the pharmacy there were at that
time no intestinal antiseptics, although
the commanding officer informed me
when I made a requisition that he had
made repeated efforts to get them. The
pharmacy at that timeâ and, indeed,
until it was ordered closed and 1
turned the stores over to the Govern
ment on the 9th of Septemberâ never
had any proper equipment for doing
pharmaceutical work. There were no
scales to measure with. The hospital
stewards used a board for a time.
There were no pill boxes or powder pa
pers. The stewards dispensed tablets
and pills in any paper they could se
cure, and they were carried to the
wards in that shape, and owing to the
prevalence of dampness at night they
would become by morning a sticky
mass not Qt for use."
The witness then went on to say that
the medical supplies did improve after
the Ist of -Autrust, but up to that time
there had been a great scarcity of suit
able supplies.
Dr. Smith said: "The water that was
furnished for the usti of the hospitals
up to August 1 was taken from the pipe
line from Chickamauga Creek, and it
was so full of sediment that it was
simply slush and not water.
"There were no floors in any of the
hospital tents at the time I reported
for duty at that hospital. The first
tent was floored soon after the middle
of July, although some were not floored
until long after that. The floors in
the tents of the Fifty-second lowa, the
First Maine and the Fifth Missouri
all laid after the troops had left
the park and were never occupied by
the soldiers and never had cots placed
in them. In fact, I might state that
the Boors were laid after orders had
received to pack goods prepara
tory to leaving for Anniston.
"In regard to nursing in that hos
pital, we had no trained nurses. All
the nursing was done by orderlies, and
many of them were densely ignorant,
and when 1 was in charge of the wards
of the Second Brigade I had two men
who could neither read nor write, and
three men who did not know the
meaning of 'Ma 1 or 'Pa,' when writ
ten."
PROBLEM OF SUPPLYING
SANTIAGO WITH WATER
General Wood Employs Three Expert
Engineers â Renegade Cubans
on the Warpath.
SANTIAGO I>K CUBA, Nov. 8. â The
main fjuestion now before General I.,eon
ard Wood, Governor of the military dis
trict of Santiago, is not pofflticaL It is
the question of water, which is a serious
problem. The rainy season is about over
and usually, after a month or so of dry
weather, water has to be brought from
the mountains and sold in the streets.
General Wood is anxious to avoid a repe
tition of such conditions, and has engaged
the services of three expert engineers to
report as to the best method of supplying
the city with water, whether with artesian
wH!s or otherwise.
Matamore, a colonel in the insurgent
army, and formerly a bandit, objecting
to the hum-drum ways of peace, recently
tn(ik to the hills with twenty men and is
now carrying on his old vocation, robbing 1
plantations and farms of cattle ana
horses, holding people up and setting in
every way a bad example. General wood
Is determined to suppress Matamore, and
a part of the gendarmerie Is now ready,
uniformed and drilled, weil mounted and
armed, to do the work. To-day twenty
men, under command of a lieutenant, left
for the locality in which Matamore and
bis companions are staying, .avith orders
to bring them all in dead or alive. The
general opinion here Is that if Matamore
la not suppressed he will soon have be
tween one and two hundred recruits, but
mow that the purpose of the authorities is
known it is not expected that many will
join him.
MERELY CLEANED UP SHIP.

There are on board about 400 persons, in
cluding a number of sick men. Captain
Hanlon was much surprised to learn that
any uneasiness had been felt for the
chip's safety. He said that shortly after
leaving Santiago he ordered the vessel
cleaned up between decks. Numerous
botea iunl other material thrown <>;â â¢ r

SAVED FROM A WRECK
AFTER A HARD STRUGGLE
Gallant Rescue of a Sailor on the Nor-

Midocean.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. B.â The German
oil tank steamer Standard, which has ar
rived here, brings Andres Anderson, a
sailor, who was rescued at sea October
19 from the wrecked Norwegian bark Sig
rid. The rescue by a boat's crew from
the Standard was a thrilling and gallant
one, and was accomplished after one boat
had been dashed to pieces against the
side of the steamer and a number oi dar
ing attempts had been made to reach the
wrecked bark. Finally Anderson was
thrown a rope, which lie fastened about
him, and then jumped into the sea. He
was drapced into the boat in an uncon
scious condition.
Anderson nays the remainder of the
crew had been taken off the bark by an
unknown vessel. He had evidently been
forgotten, for the crew failed to come
back to rescue him. The derelict was left
in latitude 66.43 north, longitude 0.43 east,
nearly submerged.

LONDON, Nov. B.â William T. Stead,
writing to the Daily News from Sebas
topol, after an interview, with the Czar
at Livadia, reiterates his conviction of
the earnestness and sincerity of the Czar's
purpose in proposing disarmament. Mr.
Stead says it is Impossible to repeat the
conversation, but he adds:
"But my opinion is summed up in a
remark which I made to a Princess of
the court, who, meeting- me as I was
leaving, asked me: 'Well, what Is your
opinion?'
"I replied simply: 'I thank God for
him. If he is spared to Russia that
young man will go far.' "
Mr. Stead adds that he found thi?
Czar possessed of exceptional rapidity of
perception, united with a remarkable
memory and a very wide grasp of an im
mense range of facts.

Negotiations.
CLAIMS OF MANY MILLIONS

State Department at
Washington.
PARIS, Nov. B.â The United States
Peace Commissioners had formulated
an answer to Spain's voluminous pre
sentment of Friday last, but the work
of typewriting this reply was too great
to be finished before 2 p. m. to-day, the
time fixed for the meeting of the joint
commissions. This fact was com
municated at noon to-day to the Span
iards, with a request that the meeting
occur at 4 o'clock to-day. This re
quest, however, was declined by the
Spaniards on the ground that they had
some other engagements for 4 o'clock
to-day. Consequently the meeting of
the joint commission was deferred until
2 o'clock to-morrow.
The Gaulois this morning, referring
to to-day's sitting of the Peace Com
mission, says it will in no way modify
the Spanish-American situation, "as
the American Commissioners have or
ders to await further instructions from
Washington."
The Gaulois says these Instructions
will depend upon the result of the elec
tions, which, the paper mentioned
thinks, will be favorable to the Repub
licans.
The Gaulois continues: "The Gov
ernment will eventually recognize
that pecuniary compensation is due
to Spain for the evacuation of
the Philippine Islands and the ne
gotiations will continue and be brought
to a satisfactory conclusion in a friend
ly spirit."
WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â The advices
that have come to hand so fax from
the commission at Paris are said to be
rather encouraging than the reverse,
and there is a disposition here to agree
to the statement, rather cautiously
made by the Spanish Cabinet yester
day, that there will be three or four
more meetings of the joint commission.
This is taken as an indication that the
Spaniards themselves are not 16oking
for a break in the negotiations, but
they rather expect a peaceful conclu^
sion in a short time.
The foreign bondholders have at last
moved formally to protect their inter
ests in Cuba and Porto Rico. The ini
tial steps have been taken through the
agency of the French Embassy, which
in this case acts no longer as the rep
resentative of the Spanish Government,
but for French subjects. Through the
Embassy a most formidable statement
has been presented to the State De
partment, being an account of the va
rious Spanish bonds owned by French
citizens chargeable against the territo
ries either seized or set free by the act
of the United States Government. The
sum total of these bonds runs up far
into the millions.
Just what it is expected shall be done
with them is not clear. The United
States Government, of course, will not
pay them, but it may be that the
French Government looks to it to cause
the independent government of Cuba
to assume liability for the redemption
of the bonds charged against that is
land when that government shall have
been duly installed by the act of the
United States Government. It is prob
able that other holders of like bonds,
German and British, will take similar
steps to have their claims brought
through their diplomatic representa
tives to the attention of the United
States Government, and it may be even
that the holders of such bonds in Spain,
though Spanish citizens, will take a
like course, which would present a
novel claim upon the generosity of the
United States Government.

TIGHTENING HER
GRIP EGYPT
England May Declare a
Protectorate.
CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE
BRITISH PUBLIC SENTIMENT
AGGRESSIVE,
Germany Friendly, Russia Absorbed
in Other Matters, and France
Alone Remains ir-
Opposition.
Special Dispatch to Tlie Call -
NEW YORK, Nov. B.â A special cable
to the Commercial Advertiser from
London says: The rumor that England
will soon declare a protectorate over
Egypt is notably persistent here and on
the continent. An influential part of
the Cabinet favors the declaration.
British newspapers are passing from
hints of it to open advocacy, and pub
lic opinion is generally encouraging.
The international situation is also fa
vorable, with Germany friendly and
Russia absorbed in other matters, leav
ing only France to oppose the plan. I
hear that the German Government is
checking obstreperous comment on the
Philippines. The German aim now is
the acquisition of any of the remaind
ers with the approval of England and
America, after the Paris negotiations
are concluded. ,â_â â¢Â«. .
PARIS, Nov. B.â The Chamber of
Ppputie*' resumed its sittings to-day
with a crowded attendance in antici
pation of a debate on the Fashoda
question. But those present were dis
appointed by M. Brunot announcing
that he withdrew his interpellation on
the subject _
ASSISTANCE REFUSED
RELEASED INSURGENTS
Plight of Sixteen Cubans Freed From
a Spanish Prison and Stranded
in New York.
NEW YORK. Nov. ?.â The sixteen Cu
ban insurgents who were recently re
leased by the Spanish Government from
the Government prison at Ceuta and who
arrived In this country last week on the
Kaiser Wilhelm 11. were to-day released
from the barge office and allowed to go,
penniless and homeless, into the streets.
They applied for help at the Cuban Junta,
but were turned away with the reply that
no funds were available for them.
The situation of these tnen is peculiar.
They were released from prison and as
they had no money for transportation and
could not secure help from the Spanish
Government they were forwarded to this
country by the United States Consul there
at the' expense of this Government. No
arrangements were made for iheir recep
tion on this side nor for their transporta
tion from this port to the island of Cuba.

A NEW ( SLANG PHRASE WANTED.
"I have been waiting for months."
he said, "for some bright idiot to come
along with something really new and
good in the way of popular slang â the
kind that is noj. offensive and furnisaes
jan unfailing although eventually a
J monotonous defense for repartee fiends.
Let's go back a few years into history
thanks. No, I'll pour it out mys;elf
please. As I was saying, let's go back
into history. My hobbby. you know, is
tracing the origin of slang. I never use
slang myself, but the study of it
amuses me. I started it several years
ago, beginning with 'There are oth- va.'
Now, there was a bit of slang that
played a star engagement and *i?ed
longer, with subsequent variation, than
anything that has been coined within
the scope of my memory. As nearly as
I can make out, 'There are others' was
used as slang for the first time in the
Umbrella, a newspaper hang-out in
i New York, and the occasion for it was
i the fact that one man in the row had
been forgotten in the round. As I re
marked. 'There are others' lived for a
long time, which was because it really
meant something and had a world of
meaning at times. It has disappeared
for good, though, in this part of the
country. I understand, however, that
it is just getting a hold in Texas.
" 'There are others' was succeeded
by 'You're not the only pebble on the
beach,' which originated in a variety
theater at Coney Island with a cheap
song-and-dance sketch. It was taken
up and popularized as slang, that is,
the first of it was. With 'You're not the
only' as a foundation the original repar
tee fiends twisted all sorts of things
out of this bit of slang, and it subse
quently degenerated into every conceiv
able form, until it became 'Oh, I don't
know, you're not the only â ' with any
thing one wanted tacked onto the end.
Now, really, since those I have men
tioned became obsolete, there has been
no clever bit of slang worth speaking

ARE SENDING FREE A TRIAL PACKAGE

Free samples of a most remarkable
remedy are being distributed by the State

cured so many men who had battled for
years against the mental and physical
suffering of lost manhood that the insti-
tute has decided to distribute free trial
packages to all who write. It is a home
treatment and all men who suffer with
any form of sexual weaknr resulting
from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak tack, varico-
cele, or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where it is needed
It cures all the ills and troubles that
come from years of misuse of the natural
functions and haÂ« been an absolute suc-

cured of sexual weakness when the
proper remedies are employed. The in-

are all looking for something new this
rail, and it's hard to find. Of course,
there have been a lot of inane coin
ages which do not aspire to the dignity
of being worth the living. 'Chesty.' is
a word that has been used up to date
for several months, but it is absolutely
meaningless. That's a funny thing
about this kind of slang. A man seems
to know what another man means when
he says 'Hello, my chesty friend,' or
'Now, don't get chesty about a little
thing like that,' and yet there is not
a man living who could, if the life of
him depended on it, define the word or
give yo-u any very accurate idea of
what it means. But, as I remarked, we

in every drug store, a man who needs them some-

although the druggist will generally get them if

Steamer Stuck on a Cat
Island Reef.
FIERCE GALE STILL BLOWING
IMPOSSIBLE TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT HER.
Should the Vessel Prove to Be the
Spanish Cruiser Every Effort
Will Be Made to Save
Her.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gor
don Bennett.
NASSAU, N. P., Nov. B.â A large
steamer with two masts and two fun
nels, which is believed to be the aban
doned Spanish cruiser Infanta Maria
Teresa, is reported to be lodeed on a
reef north of Cat Island. A second gale
is blowing, and it is impossible to learn
about her. Saturday was the last day
she was heard from. She was then
tvo miles off shore. Persons are ready
to board her when the weather moder
ates.
NORFOLK. Va., Nov. B.â The Merritt
Wrecking Com-anv has received infor
mation that the Maria Teresa is ashore
at Cat Island. Captain Chittenden will
leave with the steamer Merritt at once.
The tele ram came from I. J. Merritt,
New York, and reads as follows:
"Teresa ashore on Cat Island. Hold
Merritt with crew and apparatus; also
Captain Chittenden."
The Merritt was to have left for New
York this afternoon, but that order was
revoked, and preparations are now
making to start for Cat Island. The
Navy Department at Washington has
been notified.
WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â The Navy
Department is without advices con
cerning the Maria Teresa, but, acting
on the newspapers' reports of her
stranding on Cat Island in the Wat
ling Island group, has sent orders to
the Vulcan* at Norfolk and the Poto
mac at Santiago to leave immediately
for Cat Island, and if the vessel is
found to do everything possible to save
her. The expedition will be under con
trol of Captain McCalla, who com
manded the Marblehead in the Spanish
war, and is now in charge of the Nor
folk navy-yard. The Vulcan should
reach the scene in forty-eight hours
and the Potomac in less time.

She Joins in the Train
of Gage and Neff,
Indications Point to the Election
of the Entire Republican
State Ticket and Many of
the County Officers.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 8.
Afaneda County was entirely given over
tn To-day's election. Business was prac
tically suspended, not a city or county of
ficer could be found In any of the depart
jnents, and everybody either took advan
tage of the holiday to stay at home or
tame out on the streets to do politics.
Every hack and buggy that could be
pressed into service was chartered by the
candidates. If anybody walked to the
{â oils It was not because half a dozen con
veyances were not placed at hia disposal,
It was a good day for dealers In horse
Jflesh and the candidates were indeed gen
erous, more so than usual.
It was a good voting day, warm and
genial, and just such a day as curbstone
(politicians delight In, and yet the vote
â Vas.not a large one, even for a year not a
[Presidential year. The heaviest voting
t-ivas done â¢â ' ire noon, but in some pre
krinote. especially in the aristocratic Fifth
'^Yard. with over 200 names, less than 100
(exercised their right to vote. The day
â¢was almost devoid of excitement, except
Â»of " that suppressed kind, which la a
â¢natural accompaniment of an election.
[workers were to be found everywhere and
[toward the time for closing the polls the
tetreets and sidewalks were a mass of dis
carded tickets, circulars, badges, slips and
other campaign accessories. Certainly no
"other campaign has been characterized by
[6Uch an. enormous amount of printed and
dllustrated matter. Every candidate,
without exception, even to the Independ
ent seekers after obscure constableshtps,
Â«caivred his pictures around like hail.
I^.-=:ead 0/ voting inside the old City
Hal/, as in former years, a booth was
erected on the sidewalk and it was labeled
"New City Hall." This little pleasantry
attracted almost as much attention as the
names on the ballots. In East Oakland a
remnant of the Hilborn-Metcalf unpleas
antness was in evidence and the Hilborn
men were very anxious to let Frank Jor
dan's friends know that they were not
voting for him. But the County Clerk's
followers were more in evidence than his
opponents.
In the Fourth and Sixth wards the
great battle was between Church and
(ilascock for Supervisor. Each man put
up a good organization and fought until
tne polls closed as eagerly as any eager
candidate could. In Berkeley Charles
Spear and A. K. Grim fought each other,
and each had an army of workers sys
tematically staked out. The street rail
road boys were solid for Grim, and to
their energetic work he owes three-quar
ters of all the votes cast for him.
On the whole, the election was very or
derly and quiet.
At Emeryville the racetrack employes
voted in great numbers, and there were
over one hundred challenges in the pre
cinct. All but three, however, swore in
their votes, and although there was a lit
tle excitement there was nothing disor
derly. Throughout the county everything
â was as quiet as in the city.
Jin the Seventh Ward Dr. Carpenter of
.llameda and Councilman Pringle had a
.^ttle scrap and the doctor, who is a uep-
Ay constable, placed the Councilman
under arrest. The matter was settled
amicably.
The State Republican ticket has proba
bly received Its normal majority of from
?000 to 4000 in this county. At 2 o'clock
this morning less than half of the ballots
.had, been counted, and Gage was leading
by-< r *bout 1600. At this ratio his majority
over Maguire should be about 3500. J. H.
> T eff will probably run ahead or these fig
ures about 500.
Victor Metcalf is running very strongly
for Congress, and his majority over Jones
Is estimated at from 4000 to 6000.
At 1 o'clock this morning the figures
â¢were: Gage, 5300; Maguire, 3550;; Hutchi
son, 3440; Neff. 5,530.
Secretary of State â Curry 4620; Thorn
eon, 4565.
For Justicesâ Conley, 3890; McFarland,
4380; Van Dyke, 4086; Van Fleet, 4088.
Board or Equalizationâ Alex Brown,
Â£52*; Thomas Scott. 3581.
Railroad Commissionersâ N. Woodstock,
4911; J. H. Dryden. 3005.
Johnston will probably receive a major
ity of 2500 for State Printer, and the other
candidates on the State ticket will have
majorities varying from 1500 to 2800.
There were some surprises as the vote
progressed on the Alameda County ticket.
The candidates â  elected are probably:
Sheriff. Oscar Rogers (R.); District At
torney, J. J. Allen (R.); County Clerk. F.
C. Jordan (R.); Assessor, H. P. Dalton
(R.); Treasurer. A. Feldlcr (R. Tax
Collactor, J. Barber (R.) ; Recorder, A. K.
Grim (Ind. R.); -Superintendent of Schools,
T. O. Crawford (D.): Coroner, McManus
(D.) or Dr. Mehrmann (R.); Public Ad
ministrator, B. C. Hawes (R.); Auditor,
J. Cal Ewlng (R.); Surveyor, G. L. Nus
baumer (R.); for city Justices .of the
Peace J. w. Stetson and Mortimer Smith
are almost certainly elected.
Not until all the votes are counted can it
be decided who has been elected Supervis
ors. Church and Olascock are level In
the Third District and Talcott leads
Heyer slightly in the Second District. The
large vote given to A. K. Grim, the Inde
pendent Republican " candidate ' for Re
corder, was somewhat of a surprise. All
the street railroad men organized to help
him and the amount of campaigning 700
car men can do Is shown by Grim's votes.
-Cames McManus, the Democratic can
didate for Coroner, polled a much larger
vote than It was expected he would, and
not until the count is ended can it be cer
tain whether he or Dr. Mehrmann has
come out a winner.
ALAMEDA VOTED SHORT,
BUT VOTED WELL
From Indications Nearly All or the
Officers Will Be Be
publicans.
ALAMEDA, Nov. The vote of Ala
meda this year fair about two hundred
short of that of 1896. From indications
the Republican nominees, , with the ex- j
ception of T. â¬. Stoddard for County
Clerk, have carried this city by satisfac
tory majorities.
Gage has fully seven hundred majority.
Jones, for Congress, made no showing
â whatever agalnÃt Metcalf. E. K. Taylor j
for the Senate from the Twenty-eighth
District, < has run ahead of his ticket. ;
Tobin polling a very small vote.
J. R. Knowland for the Assembly, has ;
beaten E. A. Holman fully four to one.
The Supervisorial contests are close. J.
R. Tnlcott will go out of this city with a
majority of 100 over Heyer, the normal
Republican majority in this section being
five hundred. ,
W. H. Church and J. R. Glascock are
running neck and neck with the odds In
favor of Church leaving this city with a
small majority. George Lovegrove
(Ind.) cuts little figure in the fight.
In the Sheriff's. fight Oscar Rogers has
a walkover, 90 per cent- of the ballots be
ing in his favor. T. C. Stoddard developed
great strength all over the city and it is
generally conceded that he will beat Jordan
oy, about two hundred. J Jordan polled the
heV'ic-st vote in the section which is part
of Church's Supervisorial District.
Jflnru'B B. Barber for Tax Collector has
ruri ahead of his ticket. O. A. Lane did
not poll the strength of the Democratic
votÂ£. Spear seems to leaJ in the Record
er's fight, with Grim a good second and
McDonouirh far in the rear. .
The Call's DredJcUona qa tb,Â» township
contest were fully verified by the vote. I
i Morris defeated Hard fur Justice by fully !
, eight hundred. Gray and Clark are '
elected Constables, but the latter dropped
considerably behind his ticket. \
While intense interest was mani- t
rested in the election here to-day. '
j there was not a single instance of [
disturbance or friction of any kind re
: ported from the thirteen polling places.
The claim made by the chairman of tlpe (
county committee of the Unionists that
: there were TOO illegal voters on the Ala- :
; meda precinct registers was nut Bubstan- f
i tiated. There was no evidence of stuffing
i and but very little challenging. The elec- '
i tion laws were obeyed to the letter.
The peculiar feature of the contest was j
the fact that in no case was a concen- '
trated effort made by the partisans of the I
different parties to boost their entire
ticket. Invariably the workers had se
lected some favorite nominee and were
devoting their attention to bis success. '
At all the polling places T. C. Stoddard, !
Democratic candidate for County Clerk !
had numerous representatives, while only !
In isolated cases was anything being!
done for his opponent. Frank C. Jordan
The Republicans devoted their a
tibns to the Supervisorial contests. Act- I
Ingr on the theory that Alameda is nor
mally three to one Kepublican. they al- '
jowed the county ticket tv take care of
Itself.
In the Alameda section of the Third ,
Supervisorial District W. H. Church's i
friends were unusually active. John R '
Qlascock, Democrat, was not as well i
represented.
The partisans of J. R. Talcott. Republi
can, and Charles Heyer. Democrat, Su- i
pervisorial candidates from the S.-ccnd :
District, put up the liveliest fight of tht
day.
A QUIET DAY IN
THE COLLEGE TOWN
Students Took a Marked Interest in
the Progress of Af
fairs.
BERKELEY. Nov. B.â Nothing of im
portance marked the polling to-day In
the university town. Interest centered
chiefly at Berkeley station, in the busi
ness portion of the city, where the high
eat vote was reached. The struggle be
tween Charles Spear and A. K. Grim
candidates for County Recorder, became
acute there. The independent candi
date a supporters made this their strong
hold, and polled a heavy vote in his favor.
In the outlying precincts everything re
mained very quiet throughout the entire
day. The members of the Gage Club of
the University of California worked hard
for their party in securing a full represen
tation of students ;it tbe polls.
Many of the stuflents returned to their
own homes to cast their votes. Center
street, by Berkeley station, was tbconged
with hundreds of people till a very late
hour to-night watching the election re^
turns comein.

SENATE AND HOUSE
WILL BE REPUBLICAN
CHICAGO, Nov. B.â Returns received j
by the Inter Ocean up to midnight mdi- \
cate that In the Fifty-sixth Congress |
the Republicans will control the House j
of Representatives and increase the !
membership in the Senate by from six
to eight.
According to the official claÃsiflcationj
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1898.
of the Senate, it contains at present 44
Republicans, 34 Democrats, 5 Populists,
4 Sllverltes nd% 1 Independent. Classified
as gold and silver men, the body stands
equally divided â 45 to 45. A more fitting
classification, however, gives the sil
verltes a majority of ten on any test
question in which the financial princi
ples of the Democratic party are In
volved. It is possible that after the
4th of March, 1899, the silver men will be
in the minority.
The House of Representatives in the
present Congress has a Republican
majority of fifty-five in all. This large
majority will be reduced by the result
of to-day's voting, but Speaker Reed
will be re-elected and have a majority
of members with him.
The losses sustained in Illinois, Indi
ana and Kentucky have surprised the
Republican leaders. In this city, on
the face of the returns at 12:30 o'clock
this (Wednesday) morning, the Demo
crats have elected Johnson in the Sec
ond, Cusack in tha Fourth, Noonan in
the Fifth and Hoechster in the Seventh
districts, but by majorities so small
that the official count may be necessary
to determine the results.
USES FOR FINGER RINGS.
Rings have been made for almost all
purposes. Thus we find cramp rings,
said not only to cure cramp, but to pre
vent its return; amulet rings, infallible
protectors against the "evil eye"; as
tronomical, dial and zodiacal rings;
JUST LIKE OLD ELECTION SCENES.
Senatorial Candidates Dennery and Ashe Nearly Come to Blows in the Lively
Tenderloin.
j. "[ T looked like "doing:" old-time politics in Precinct 2of the Forty-third Assembly District, the polling place
â¢. I of which was located on Stockton street, between O'Farrell and Ellis. Sluggers, white and black, and the speedy
A male members of the tenderloin were out in full force and formed the "push" for several candidates. Fights were
>) by no means infrequent. The main contest lay between the opposing candidates for the honors of State Senator. Leon
â¢ Dennery and R. Porter Ashe. In fact, the spirit of opposition was so strong- that at one time the principals them
â¢) selves came very nearly getting- mixed up In a, personal encounter.
>) The trouble started early in the day when the rivals' supporters took exceptions to each other's methods in and
â¢) near tin- booth. These little differences resulted in scraps between John Taylor and Ed Rilcy. Both men were ar
ij rested for disturbing the peace. The spirit of war excited the others and in a short time half a dozen settos
>) took place, none of which resulted very seriously. It was a nasty tempered crowd, ;ind the animus of the work
m crts soon spread to the principals themselves.
ij The real trouble came about in this manner: Dennery and Ashe were told that the other party was getting the
j) best of affairs in the booth, the charge being that the rival push was coercing voters, oven within the sacred pre
) cincts of the voting place. Names wore called from opposite sides of the crowd and each waa anxioua to get at the
) other, well knowing that their respective friends would not permit things to go too far.
) While the principals were venting their rage upon the atmosphere their followers were working themselves
â ) into a condition that might have meant riot, had there not been so many policemen handy. At last the two
) chiefs got close together and there was a rush. For a second or two it seemed as though a lively scrimmage would
) result. However, friends and the officers got between the men and the blows intended for each other's noses
) simply fanned the air.
) A couple of mahogany-colored plug-uglies, believing that they would be serving the interests of their candidate,
) waited outside of a cigar store in order to have a go at Ashe, but they were called to their senses by some good ad
) vice and Mr. Ashe's face was saved from being injured.
) During the most of the day J. Nealon was engineering the fight in this precinct for Mr. Ashe and "Zeke" Abra
) haras conducted affairs for Mr. Dennery. While they were watching the voting a large number of the rough element
("undertook to make things very lively in the old-fashioned manner. Throughout the afternoon little personal encoun
) tors took place all the way from the booth to O'Farrell street. It was a punch on the nose or eye and a breakaway.
) When a known enemy could not be found any stranger would do to stop a straight from the shoulder and these
) affairs were begun so quietly and ended so quickly that the police found no opportunity to do anything but scat
) ter the crowd.
\ Sergeant Shea and four officers were kept busy all day driving the people from the immediate vicinity of the poll
> ing booth, and the scrappers were therefore not seriously molested in their occupation of punching noiiCiÃ.
) "It is just like the good olden times down near the What Cheer House on Sacramento street," remarked Rob
i crt Ferral, who was watching and enjoying the revived political spirit of twenty-five years ago. It was really a hot
> time.
i There were IS9 names on the precinct register and when the polls closed at sundown lE3 had voted.

A FAROE VILLAGE.
Here and there an old man sits at his
cottage door mending his rakes or fit
ting the short straight blade of his
scythe to Its long wooden handle.
The village carpenter has finished his
day's work on the boa,* which he is
building, and is carrying in what re
mains of the wood and of the woolen
yarn with which he calks the seams.
Perhaps a man may be seen in sump
corner chopping up a hard black mass
with an ax. The mass is di^ed whale's
llesh. and he will boil it down for his
cow to eat, for he has been too busy
all day in the hayfleld to take her be
yond the wnli to pasture.
Behind little walls, built half of stone
and half of whales' skulls, huge black
caldrons of fish oil, each presided over
by a woman or a child, are steaming
on fires of peat or of fresh whales'
bones. On the shore some men and
boys, who have been out to catch saith
or to shoot a few puffins for their even
ing meal are dragging up their long,
narrow boat over rollers of whales'
rib?. Round the houses, or where they
lare in the steep hayfields, the children
ire lumping-; the younger among them
dragging about the bones .from the
whales' backs like toy carts, though
mrts are things which they have never
iteen. On some patch tHat is already !
juuwu the alder ones play, at a game I
called "sheepdogs," which may have
originated from (or given origin to) the
game of cricket, although the bat is
but a plank of wood and the ball a ring
of sheeps' horns fitting into one an
other.âBlackwood's Magazine.
ABOUT GLASS EYES.
The popular Idea is that the artificial
eye Is in the form of a sphere and com
pletely fills a cavity after the removal
of the natural organ. In point of fact,
the glass eye has about the same shape
as a portion of an eggshell cut off very
close to the smaller end. The white of
the glass eye is one-fortieth of an inch
thick, while the cornea, or the colored
portion, is one-twentieth of an inch
thick. The use of the cnampl gives a
perfectly smooth surface, under which
are made, in exact reproduction of the
natural eye, the minute veins seen cov
ering the white portion. The cornea
has a very slight elevation, and in coloi
can be made to match any orb. The
edge of the glass is sometimes ground
and used without any further finish.
Ground edges are liable to produce irri
tation. The best glass eyes are those
which havp delicately enameled edges,
presenting, even under the microscope,
no roughness of surface in any part.
The most favorable condition for the
use of a glass eye is that in which the
organ still remains in the socket, al
thoupn shrunken and destroyed for all
purposes of sight. In the majority of
cases the oculist tries upon the patient j
. first an eye smaller than , the size re
! quired to mate with the sound eye.
This is especially necessary when the
parts are still tender. In a short time
this may.be removed and a larger sub
stituted until the required size is arriv
ied at. If there be a sufficient portion
I of the natural organ remaining, it is
I almost -Impossible to distinguish the
I glass eye from its mate.â Philadelphia'
j Times.

THE DIFFICULTIES OF AN ENGLISH
LETTER CARRIER.
For some reason or other in our little
fishing village the old residenter was
superseded by a new . postman. We re
sented the slight thrown upon the village.
One week convinced the man himself
that it was impossible for a strnngor to
deliver the letters. On Monday morning
he could not arrange his bundle. The so
called streets were not named, nor were
the houses numbered. He began by in
quring from door to door, but could not
get an owner for a letter. For he in
variably used the distinction instead of
the surname.
At length he discovered his mistake.
When he aaked for Mrs. James Euphemia
instead of Mrs. James Thompson (Eu
phemia), Mrs. Warrender (Janet) took
pity upon the "pair cralttur" and ex
plained the addresses to him. The expla
nation did not enlighten him much, for
we were not otherwise disposed to help
him. At length. In despair, he bought a
"pund o' sweeties" and went down to the
beach. He induced the boys and girla
with the promise of the "sweeties" to
take the letters to their mothers. But
he learned little by watching them, as
they dived out and in through the closes
and courts like rabbits in a warren, .by
the same means he delivered the letters
for three days, arid then asked to be re
moved. We thus scored against the au
thorities, and our old postman was re-
Btored to his place.â Chambers' Journal.

COMBATING THE TSETSE FLY.
All have heard of the ravages of the
terrible tsetse fly of Africa, which is so
fatal to cattle r.nd horses that none of
these animals can approach with im
punity the so-called "fly-belt" where
the dreaded insects congregate. This
belt commences about 100 miles from
the coast, and extends for about the
same distance up country, and the re
inforcements recently sent to Uganda
to quell the mutiny which broke out
among the Soudanese troops were com
pelled to cross it. In order to protect
their ponies two officers of the Royal
Welsh Fusiliers hit upon the device of
dressing the animals up in specially
constructed garments, which gave
them a most comical appearance, re
sembling the pantomimic creatures
seen on the stage at Christmne time.
First the ponies were swathed in
bands of straw, on the top of which
came coat and trousers of cloth dipped
in oil and iodoform. It was necessary
thus to rais^ the material from actual
contact fiom the hide of the animals,
for the tsetse fly can pierce ordinary
cloth. II will be interesting to learn
whether the ponies thus protected went
unscathed through the terrible 'fly
belt," for the experimental clothing, if
effectual, may lead to the introduc
tion of some material which may come
into regular employment for the same
object. â Chambers' Journal.

ADVICE TO A MOTHER!
Fullness of health, vitality and vigor make happy homes and
successful wives.
Debility, premature decay, ster ility, cause domestic misery, deser-
tion and divorce.
Don't Be a Worn-Out Woman, You Were
Intended to Be Strong.
I\O \A/OIV\ \\l Can retaln ner strength who suffers from
nvj Â»t \j|Â»lr\l> weakness and disease of the delicate and
important organs that make wifehood and motherhood possible. Do
not neglect the first indication of ill health, painful menses, pain in
the side, headache or backaciie. Vitalism will cure, drugs only irri-
tate. Take Cardine for weak heart, cerebrine for brain fag, etc.;
ovarine for amenorrhoea, hysteria, sterility; uterine for nervous ex-
haustion and premature decay. Great restoratives and vitalizers.
THE
TREATMENT
OF
1898.
Uterine wafers restore all monthly irregularities promptly, posi-
tively and permanently, when every other method fails.
Vitalism acts directly on the sensitive organs; it makes them
strong and vigorous; it prepares them to bear the burdens of mater-
nity. They are nature's own remedies.
Vitalism Makes Women New.
Those living in the city or vicinity can learn all about It by call-
ing at our office. Those living at a distance can write for full in-
formation and a free sample of Vitalism.

A WHITEWASH FOR
STANFORD'S TEAM
The Olympic Club's Football Eleven Wins
Its First Game This Season
Yesterday.
Olympic, 12; Stanford, 0.
WITH a line Blowing no more co
hesion or stability than stairs of
panel, the Stanford eleven waa
twice forced the complete length of
the gridiron for two touchdowns in the
football panic- yesterday afternoon at
Recreation Park, and it was the Olympic
team that administered the medicine. It
was the first victory for the clubmen this
season out of six games played.
Many excuses are given by the cardinal
for their defeat â an absence of the col
lege team ends, poor physical condition
and the determination to play nothing but
a defensive same. The playing of a pure
ly defensive game on the part of the col
lege men may have been due to the prose
cution of the coach's advice, but Harry
Cross certainly did not counsel the Stan
ford team to permit the Olympics to open
up holes between guards and tackles fit
for the entry of an entire livery stable.
The halves were but twenty minutes in
HARD LINES FOR WIVES.
Like in pnme other countries, the
mother-in-law in India is the bete noir of
the daughter-in-law's existence, says the
New York Press. Her duty of dealing
strictly with the young girl, who has -only
lately experienced a mother's petting, may
make her appear harsher than she reaily
is; yet when all has been said in her
favor. It must be candidly admitted t.iat
ah'- is excessively hard and unsympathetic
and that the girl's dislike of her is quite
reasonable. Every proverb which speaxs
of her gives expression to one and the
same sentimentâ she is unpopular because
she is harsh toward her suna (pronounced
"soon"), her daughter-in-law. For a few
years at least the sasu (mother-in-law)
reigns supreme, and. as another proverb
expresses it, "The daughter-in-law must
dance to the mother-in-law's music."
In some phrases and sayings t"ne sasu is
represented as attacking her suna indi
rectly; If she did it directly she knows
the girl would complain to her parents of
harsh treatment. So she grumbles at the
cooking pots, or she lectures the fowls as
to what duties are expected of a young

Secretary Wadham of the Eureka Society
Reports in Favor of the State
Foundling Asylum
SECRETARY WADHAM of the Eureka Society for the Protection of Chil
dren yesterday afternoon formally i nvestigated the complaints that were
lodged against the management of the San Francisco Lying-in Hospital and
Foundling Asylum and found nothing in the administration of the Institution
to substantiate the charges. The ladies of the Frauen Verein have had unfavor
able reports as to the condition of the Institute referred to them and Secretary
Wadhanrs investigation was the direct result, of the benevolent interest manifest
ed by those ladies. The accusations lodged against the institute were principally
charges of neglect and lack of proper nourishment. Graphic word pictures were
submitted and it was the descriptions of the emaciated foundlings that roused the
charitable ladies to action.
The Foundling Asylum is situated at 913 Golden Gate avenue and is tinder the
management of Miss Jessie Carter and a corps of seven nurses. J. W. Ellsworth
of the Hoys' and Girls' Aid Society is the superintendent of the institution. At
present there are seventeen foundlings in the asylum, for which the State pro
vides at the monthly rate of $8 per- capita. Secretary Wadham found the home
Cleanly and neat and the snnitary conditions excellent. The little ones repose in
little white enameled iron cribs in large, airy and properly hented rooms. There
is plenty of food for the natural requirements of all the inmates and the only
thing the management feels the need of is outer clothing for the litttle ones
such as dresses and coats.
The oiily foundation for the charges brought is the miserable appearance of
the children. The babies are emaciated and scrawny. The heaviest baby, a little
fellow of ". months, weighs but W% pounds, while the light weight of the institu
tion tips the scale at 5 pounds. This pitiful condition of the little ones, however,
is but the natural sequence of the miserable conditions suiwunding their birth.
The records of the little ones show that each day spent at the asylum means
physical improvement.
The San Francisco Lying-in Hospital and Foundling Institute was founded on
the 9th of April, 1898. During its seven months of existence it has cared for thirty
foundlings and has had but one deathâ a record that speaks for itself.
length: had they been the full regulation
time the Olympics would have probably
scored four * touchdowns instead of two.
As it is the Olympics are parading the
town with mouths skywardly inclined at
the ends, and the Stanford facial orifice is
pretty much on the droop.
The game opened by a kick-off by the
Olympics. The next play was a punt by
Murpby to Mcl.aine on the Olympic forty
yard line. Then the clubmen began to
shed their skins and play ball. First,
Morse, tht-n Sheehy or Wilson or Atkinson
was given the pigskin and they hammered
the unsticky line of the cardinal for
steady, regular gains until the cardinal
team was forced to their own ten-yard
line. Then something happened, which
for its unexpectedness and inconsistency
filled the l'w spectators with wonderment
and genuine surprise. The Stanford line.
wonderful to relate, actually made a stand
against the Olympics and captured the
bail on downs.
Murphy, after three successful tries
were made by the Stanford backs, punted
to the center. It was then the Olympic's
ball and Code gave the signal which
placed the ball In the hands of Eugene
wife; but It is all meant as a cap to fit
the daughter-in-law's head. Hence it is
Bald: "The words art addressed to the
fowls, but the daughter-in-law takes no
tice of them;" and again. "Talking: to the
saucepans, it affects the daughter-in
law."
If the young wife has any spirit left in
her this continual nagging ran have only
one effect. It develops a rebellious course
of behavior, and it makes her thoroughly
detest the home she is in and all the peo
ple belonging to it.
Of the two homes with which the young
â wife is connected her mother's is the one
she loves, her mother-in-law's the one
she dislikes. "Thorns prick her." it is
said, "on going to her mother-in-law's;
but she feels delight in coming to her
mother's." In the latter home she is
Bure of affection and of freedom from
drudgery, and a willing ear will he lent
to her tale of bickerings, quarrels and ill
treatment. "Happiness in a mother's
house, pain in a mother-in-law's," is an
other proverb to the same effect.
The young wife has one consolation; it
is that the sasu does not live forever. A

star of the game, finding it but very lit
tle of a trick to shatter tho Stanford line

two touchdowns, from which he kicked
goals. His playing was of the rame bril
liant character, as in the former games of
the season. . , ..
Stanford did not have possession of Ihe

did not try offensive work, and though
they attempted a defensive game, there
was little of that to be noticed. Ihe sec- i

the Stanford line and seemed to enjoy the
result very much. At the close of the
game Murphy tried a drop kick for goal
from the thirty-yard line, but missed the
mark by a few feet. ..
For the first time this season there
seemed to be among the spectators a num
ber of Olympians, who cheered the efforts
of their team. Victory begets friends and
the Olympics won the applause yesterday.

day comes when the sasu gets old and
infirm, and, although there is no little
kindness and gentleness in the average
Hindoo homes, yet the aged cues among
the people do not always receive the care
they mij. r ht. So. as the sasu gets old, or,
when her husband dies and she becomes a
widow, the daughter-in-law has a fair op
portunity of practicing "tit for tat."
As years pass by the wife finds her
self grown to middle age, with sons about
her, for one of whom a young wife is
soon brought home, and she in her turn
becomes a sasu. All the unpleasantness
she herself had to bear when first mar
ried might be expecud to awaken a iit
tle sympathy in her mind for the girl
br. >ught to her to train; but, human ga
ture being what it is, no sooner does she
i.ecome a sasu Than she begins to look
b&ck on the treatment she received as
being quite correct after all, and straight
way she begins to practice it herself.
For it Is said: "On becoming a mother
in-law the torment of being a daughter
in-law is forgotten!"
SNAKE YARNS FROM ARIZONA.
The mining: camp of Kingman was re
cently invaded by a host of rattlesnakes,
creating great consternation among the
people. Snakes were discovered^ in beds
and made desperate fights when tackled
by the owners. People sleeping outdoors
narrowly missed a violent death from the
poisonous fangs of the serpents. The
snakes wiggled through the crevices of
the tight board fences, and were caught
while endeavoring to enter the houses.
People have taken to sleeping upstairs,
and a band stand and pavilion are crowd
ed every night by sleepers who dare not
risk sleeping on the bare ground. A spell
of unusually warm weather Is thought to
be the cause of the snakes leaving their
rocky fastnesses for a cooler abode in the
settlement.
A man at Mesa City has a petGila mon
ster. He let it go about six weeks ago in
order that it might shed its skin, as is its
annual custom. The other day it returned
to its usual haunts looking thoroughly re
juvenated. Its owner gave it a bath, aft
er which it made a break for its feed box,
where it has been in the habit of eating
eggs and other luxuries.
.Toads grow to an abnormal size in
Southern Arizona, and often exhibit a
preternatural intelligence. Recently the
arc lights were started at Mesa. City, and
myriads of bugs are in consequence at
tracted at night by the glare. The toads
have discovered this new source of sup
ply, and eat the bugs that fall to the
ground as rapidly as they come within
reach. It is supposed that the new diet
has created an unnatural thirst, and in
looking around for a source from which to
quench it they discovered the troughs
that receive the drippings from the beer
faucets in the saloons. They now intrude
in the saloons and line up to the
troughs and drink until they are thor
oughly intoxicated, many falling to the
floor as though dead, 1 while others un
steadily hop to the sidewalk and resume
their feasting. . .
James Thomas, a rancher living on the
Verde River, in Yavapal County, has dis
covered a scheme. that threatens to revo
lutionize existing irrigation methods.
Wnlle walking along the canal bank the
other day he observed an enormous bull
snake stretched at length, with its head
in the water and its body pulsating like a
steam pump. Observing the reptile, still
more closely, he was amazed to â¢ see a
stream of water flowing from its tail.
It was actually pumping water. That
bullsnake Is a harmless creature, and Mr.
Thomas, seized with an idea, also seized
the snake. How to make it throw a
larger stream of water was the question,
and after considerable thought he tried
the experiment of cutting off a portion of
the tall. By this means the snake was
induced to throw a full head of; water
at a minimum exertion, and seemed to
enjoy the joke. Mr. Thomas captured
many other bullsnakes, which, by asso
ciation, with the F original â  pumper, soon
became adepts in the new i system for ir
rigating, r Then their tails were removed,
and for days : the . side â  of ; the ranch next
the river was lined with snakes engaged
in throwing up streams of water from an
inch to an inch and a half in diameter.
A mining man came along a few days ago
and was struck with" the novelty of i the
irrigating ' method adopted. He thought
that the snakes might be used in hy
draulic mining, and a number of them
were f coupled together : like :â  garden ' nose,
the experiment, however/ was not entirely
successful, several of the snakes bursting
through unevenness ; of pressure.â Denver

NO MORE TOWN AND GOWN ROWS.
The almost complete disappearance of
town and gown rows is another sign of
the times, almost as difficult to explain
as the disuse of dueling in England or
of standup fights at public schools. But
so it is, and though a slight recrudescence
of the old feud took place during a late
visit of the Prince of Wales, young towns
men now mix with undergraduates in the
streets, even on the sth of November,
without finding the slightest occasion for
an exchange of blows or insults. Only
those who have studied the history of Ox
ford from the middle ages downward,
with its long record of constitutional
struggles and sanguinary encounters be
tween the city and the university, can
duly estimate the importance of this
change, which is now so familiar that it
has ceased to be recognized.
Several causes have combined to bring
It about, besides the general diminution
of rowdyism and brutality visible In all
our great towns. One of these is the
great Improvement of the police system,
another is the spontaneous abandonment
by the university authorities of various
privileges offensive to citizens, a third is
the dispersion of so many undergrad
uates in lodging-houses kept by citizens.
Finally, under the new municipal consti
tution of Oxford, the university is offi
cially represented in the Town Council,
and some of its leading members are in
daily conference with their colleagues of
the city on municipal affairs. The rap
proachement has been powerfully aide! by
the efforts of individuals, and a sufficient
proof of its reality is furnished by the
mere fact that while the city buildings
were being reconstructed all municipal
business was conducted in the examina
tion schools, lent for the nurpose by the
university.â Nineteenth Century.
UNRULY DROP CURTAIN.
The new drop curtain which hangs
from the proscenium arch at the
Grand cut a queer caper .on the occa
sion of its lirst public appearance re
cently. It was either balky or con
cluded to go on a strike, for it re
fused to do its allotted work at the end
of the first act and spoiled a thrilling
climax.
With bated breath the gallery had
seen the heroine swing by a vine across
a yawning chasm for the purpose of
reaching the side of her wounded lover.
She had struck terra lirnia just in time
to grab a property ax, and, facing two
villains, hold them at bay, though one
was armed with a real revolver while
the other had a dirk.
"Stop!" cried the heroine. In tragic
tones*
The villains stopped. They cowered
before her blazing eyes, which flashed
tire in her righteous indignation. An
old black mammy â it was a "beauti
ful Southern comedy drama," accord
ing: to the advance agentâ rushed out
from behind a tree to reinforce her
little mistress. She, too, had an ax, of
larger caliber than tliat brandished by
the heroine, and this she held high in
the air, her good old black face wear
ing a determined do-or-die look.
Now that stop was the cue for the
stage manager to press the buttc-n. The
curtain was supposed to fall and the
gallery was expected to do the rest, j
The stage manager pressed the button
and the gallery started to do the rest,
but was unexpectedly checked in its j
demonstrations of delight at the tri- j
umph of virtue by the failure of the
new drop curtain to fall.
The drop started on its downward
path, but halfway between the prosce
nium arch and the stage it suddenly
stopped. Possibly the curtain thought j
the heroine was addressing her com
mand "stop" to it. Anyway, it stop
ped.
For an instant the audience sat still
in wonder, but only for an instant. The j
features of the heroine relaxed. Some
emotion other than indignatic-n or fear :
was moving her. The villain smiled, a i
gallery god laughed. Then the old
black mammy shifted her position.
Striking attitudes and holding them
was clearly not one c-f her accomplish
ments. The players turned their eyes j
upward toward the curtain. That beau- j
tifully decorated piece- of canvas hung j
in midair and stubbornly refused to j
move. The audience began to larch.
The new curtain had made a hit appar
ently. The stage manager :tnd his as
sistants struggled with ropes and pul
leys, but the curtain would not fall.
Finally, in desperation, the stage man
ager sent down a drop scene and hid
heroine, mammy, villains and all from
the gaze of the audience. â Atlanta
Journal.
OUTPUT OF BOURBON WHISKY.
The laws of the State of Kentucky I
are very strict against trusts. For that
reason the n:en taking the most active
part in the proposed plan to limit the
output of Kentucky whisky are pro
ceeding with caution. Without con
certed action on the part of the dis
tillers, they feel that the whisky in
dustry is doomed, and every effort will
be put forth to make the limitation
plan a success.
Attorney J. B. Thompson of Harrods
burg, who is also a distiller, Is in the
city, overseeing the printing of the du
plicate contracts which it is proposed
to have every distiller sign. The de
tails of the contract will not be made
public at present, and no distiller wiil
have a chance to know what propor
tion of the annual output of 17,500,000
rn lions is allotted to his neighbor. In
order to evade the anti-trust law, the
contract is quite elastic in this, that it
does not debar a distiller from makiner
as much whisky as he likes, but he
gives bond to deliver the surplus to
parties named at so low a figure that
he will find it unprofitable to make
more than his allotment. On his fail
ure to instantly deliver this surplus at
the low price named he must pay $10
per barrel as liquidating damages.
Colonel T. M. Gilmore of this city,
who is taking a prominent part in the
movement, is confident that the dis
tillers throughout the State are favor
able to the movement, and he thinks
they wiil all co-operate in what he be
lieves is the only plan which will
place the whisky business of Kentucky
on a paying basis.
In this connection the Cincinnati
Commercial Tribune recently said:
"Mr. John G. Roach, one of the dis
tillery kings of old Kaintuck, is at the
Gibson, and denies the fact of a meet
ing with reference to limiting the out
put of bourbon.
"I didn't expect to meet Mr. Meyer,
but will be glad to see him," said he.
"So far as the output of Kentucky is
concerned, I think I can say that the
agreement to limit it to 15,000,000 gal
lons annually will be successful. The
output has been in the neighborhood of
30,000,000, with a consumption of about
22,000,000 annually. It is believed that
with the output down to one-half the
usual figures the matter will be equal
ized, and a good demand for the prod
uct of the Kentucky distilleries will
result. There is no significance in my
being here at the same time with Mr.
Meyer. I came up to see the whole
sale men, and on private business not
connected with distilling."â Louisville

COSTLY TOBACCO 'SIGNS.
If any one will read the tobacco signs
he cannot but wonder at the weakness
of man. Now, the firms in the business i
would not go to the vast expense at
tending advertising unless it paid. And
yet it is hard for the uninitiated to un
derstand what inducements are offered
to the user of tobacco to buy a certain
kind by the advertisements they see on
every hand. For instance, if I were a
tobacco chewer, I do not think I would
be induced to purchase only that kind j
of tobacco which had for its advertise
ment a lot of monkeys sitting in a row
and their tails spelling out the name of
it. I do not think that I would only |
patronize that cigarette which had for
its advertisement a man kissing a pret
ty woman. It might be that I might
think that if I would use that kind of
cigarette I might at some time get to
kiss a pretty woman. I might be justi
fied in changing my brand of cigarette 9'
on this foolish hope, but then there i
could be no such reason in making me
change off my brand of chewing to
bacco because of the monkeys who
spelled out with their tails the name of
the tobacco which I had changed to.
Because a brand of tobacco has for its
signs a war vessel made out of a plug
of tobacco, it would not warrant me in
throwing away the kind in my pocket
to get this particular kind.
But they tell me â that is, the drum
mers doâ that these are the things that
catch the chewer and smoker. If they
do, then there must be something in
the contention of many people that to
bacco injures the brain. No one can
tell why the chewer and smoker is in
duced to buy a certain tobacco because
wholly of the advertisements? of it, but
they do. I am told by a man who
knows that one firm spent in two years
$4,000,000 or $5,000,000 in advertising one
brand of tobacco. I remember that
when Cleveland was inaugurated the
second time one of the cigarette manu
facturers placed a magnincent carriage
in the procession. In the vehicle was a
handsome woman, who bore aloft the
sign of the cigarette the manufacturer
made. The carriage was the best in
the procession, and the horses, four of
them, were the finest that could be had
in all the capital. If Cleveland had
stopped a moment on his way, I should
not have been surprised if they had
pinned a tin advertising ta~ to his
back. They tried to run this advertis
ing wagon, woman and all, out of the
procession, and the police succeeded in
doing it to the extent of getting it out
of line, but it drove into the procession
further along, and when driven from
that place it appeared in the procession
at another point. Then the constabu
lary of the capital of the country gave
up the job, and the woman rjode the trip
out, smiling over her victory as she
went along.â Calveston (Texas) News.

Short sight is more common In town

â¢Xhe Investigation Into the Beports
of the Fort Baker Scandal Will
Be Continued Again
To-Day.
The !a~Â°t of the troops of the Eighth
Army Corps, better known as the Philip
pine" Island Kxpeditionary Forces, have
!eft San Francisco. The encampment of
this army corps here, which beiran six
months ago. in now a thing of the past.
The Presidio presented a deserted appear
ance yesterday and out on the cavalry

showed whore th.Â» soldiers had lived. It
â¢will he many months before the reserva
tion will again have that immaculate
military neatness that existed before the
General Marcus P. Miller with the
Third Battailon of the Kansas regiment
and the Wyoming light Battery sailed
yesterday afternoon on the Newport.
Many people were at the wharf to bid
good-by to the general and the officers
â who sailed with him. It was after 3
o"clpck when The transport cast off her
line's and stood out into the stream. As
the Newport passed Alcatraz she was
given a salute of eleven guns in honor of
General Miller, and this was repeated
â when the vessel reached the gate by the
guns at Fort Point.
Mrs. Lowenberg, who has charge of the
Bed Cross work in the feeding of the de
parting soldiers, will to-day close the
quarters of the society, which have been
in the old Sausalito ferry building. The
Bed Cross has done a noble work in look
ing after the comfort of the soldiers in
this respect.
Two of the enlisted men of the Wyo
ming Battery missed their boat because
they left the wharf and did not get back
until the Newport had sailed. These men
â wTTTbe sent to Manila on one of the regu
lar passenger vessels.
In addition to the troops the following
men and women took passage on the
Newport:
The wife of Colonel Frederick Funston.

found by Detective Graham at a house
on Linden avenue, near Laguna street,
Wednesday afternoon and taken to police
headquarters. He made the following
statement:
I have known the dead woman, Louisa Spain,
about a couple of years. I was in the gro
cery store at Second and Minna streets.
Charles Sanderson's store, around 1 o'clock.
The shooting occurred about that time. I
went in with Louisa Spain and we had a glass
of beer and while we were in there he (Tom
Kellini) came in. He did not say a word to
me but bought a Kla?s of beer for himself,
and while he was drinking the beer he came
behind the boxes and started talking to her,
Louisa Spain. She said: "Go over to the
house and I will be there afterward." He
then said: "I will give you five minutes.
Th^n he pulled a pistol out and shot me. I
suppose he shot me because I was with the
woman. After he shot me I fell to the floor
and laid over on my side. I fell over with a
chair and then saw him shoot the woman,
Louisa Spain, and when I got up he was gone
and she was lying behind a couple of chairs.
Then I went out the side door, down Mission
street, and took a boat to Sausalito and stayed
over there a little while and came back again
to San Francisco.
Spreen was shot In the right shoulder,
the bullet passing almost through. After
making his statement he was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where the bullet was
ex tract od by Dr. Thompson. He then
went home.
Kelllni's case was called in Judge Mo
pan's court yesterday morning, but as the
Judge was sick Judge Conlan was sent for
and continued the case until to-morrow
morning. An additional charge of assault
to murder was booked against him for
shooting Spreen.

Was Not Turned Out.

weeks, says that Kenoyer left her home

told to Officer McMurray that he was

work, she says he has disregarded them
all.

Steam Whaler Thrasher Brings News
From Kotzebue Sound â The
Miners Were in Win
ter Quarters.
The officers and majority of the crew
of the Italian cruiser Etna came ashore
yesterday to see how an election was
conducted in America. They visited
the polling booths in the vicinity of the
water front in crowds during the day,
and both officers and men commented
upon the orderly manner in which things
were done. The Etna will be in port a
month or six weeks. During that time
the Italian colony will gi\'e a grand re
ception and ball in honor of the crew of.
the warship, and there will be return
functions aboard the Etna. During her
stay the cruiser will go on the drydock at
Mare Island, but as the date on which
she will go to the navy-yard has not been
fixed no time can be set for the projected
festivities.
There was a great outpouring of the
Italian colony during the day, and Peter
son's launches were kept busy carrying
visitors to the warship. No one was
taken aboard in the ship's boats, but all
the visitors who went out were permitted
to board and inspect the cruiser. The
officers of the Etna are Captain Giovanni
Giorillo; Lieutenant Commander Stanis
lois Lorecchio, executive officer; Lieuten
ant Angelo Frank, navigating officer;
Lieutenant Gionnelli, D. Loreto, Mouray,
Lechi; ensign, Coltelletti Contracano;
midshipmen, Gandolfo, ViÂ«o, Perce, Pofsi,
L>e Orentis; chief engineer, Montaldo; as
sistant engineers, Pastena, Penzo, Ver
zeginetti; surgeon, Caforio; paymaster,
Pinetti.
First Lieutenant John B. Bennett of Ihe
Seventh Infantry, aid to General Mer
riam, officially called on the commanding
officer of the Italian cruiser Etna yester
day morning for the purpose of formally
offering to the vessel and its officers the
courtesies of the harbor and neighboring
post on the part of the department com
mander. This visit will be formally le
turned by the officers of the vessel to
day.
The steam whaler Thrasher arrived
from the Arctic yesterday with 15.U00
pounds of whalebone. She brought down
two of the Kotzebue Sound gold hunters
who walked from the Kubuek River to
Point Hope in the expectation of catch
ing a whaler bound for San Francisco.
They left the other gold hunters in win
ter quarters on October 5. The rivers
were not frozen then and it looked as
though there would be a couple more
weeks of open weather. Provisions were
plentiful and four houses had been erect
ed at the mouth of the Kubuck and three
schooners were wintering there. There
was an Indian village and a missionary
in the vicinity, so the miners will not be
lonesome during the winter. There will
be a great amount of prospecting done
during the com weather. One miner
found some rich quartz, but it was only
float rock, and a party was searching for
the ledge when the camp broke up.
The river steamer John Riley, that went
on a sandbar, has been shored up for the
winter, and it is expected that she will
be got off in the spring without any dam-
age.
The returned miners bring word that
all letters for Kotzebue Sound should be
sent via St. Michael, as a dog team is to
be sent to that point at different times
during the winter.
The river steamers T. C. Walker and
Dauntless were in collision at Benicia
early yesterday morning. The Walker
was backing out when she took a sheer
and bore down on the Dauntless. The
latter had three or four of her stanchions
and a number of timbers broken. The
Walker was not injured to any extent.
The Alaska Commercial Company's
steamer St. Paul will sail again on the
17th inst. for Manila. She has been char
tered by the Government to take down
the surplus freight left behind by the
other transports.
Captain J. E. McCulloch lost his vote
yesterday. He was detailed to pilot the
transport Newport to sea, but as she was
to sail early in the day he thought he
could take her out and get back in time
to cast his ballot on his way home in the
evening. Owing to the non-arrival of
freight and one or two other matters it
was after 3 p. m. before the transport left
the wharf, and it was nearly 8 p. m. be
fore McCulloch got back to terra flrma.
And that was the way Alameda lost one
good Republican vote. ___. ,
The new ferry steamer Berkeley is not
what she was cracked up to be. Either
owing to the fact that her engines are
r.ot down to their bearings or from some
other cause, she is not nearly so fast as
she was expected to be. Then she does
not steer any better than the law allows
and her twin screws arc a sad drawback
when it comes to entering and leaving
the ferry slips. All these defects are be
ing overcome, but it will be some time
before the Berkeley is put permanently
on the run between San Francisco and
Oakland.

A FREAKY VISITOR.
He Tells Fantastic Stories to Captain
Wittman.
A. Ballinger created a sensation around
police headquarters yesterday by de
manding the protection of two detectives,
as he was afraid that he was to be mur
dered by three men who persisted in fol
lowing him around. He declared that he
was the champion feather-weight of the
world, besides being the champion swim
mer, jumper and runner.
The reason why the men wanted to
murder him was because he was engaged
to be married to a girl worth $10,000,000,
and he showed her photograph which he
had in a locket. His backers would cor
roborate his story. The freaky visitor
was sent downstairs to Captain Wittman,
where he repeated the same story. The
captain thought he had been celebrating
too freely and ordered him locked up In
the prison on a charge of "drunk." Later
he was sent to the insane ward of the Re
ceiving Hospital and will be examined by
the Insanity Commissioners this morn
ing. He was attired in training costume
and wore a big yellow chrysanthemum in
his buttonhole.
