NEW YORK, Feb. 28.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele=
graphs: A dispatch was received at the
State Department from Consul-General
Lee to=day, in which he fortifies his
previously expressed opinion that the
Maine was destroyed by an outside
explosion. The dispatch fully confirms
the Herald's dispatches announcing the
finding of unexploded ten-inch powder
tanks and of rapid=fire ammunition for
the smaller guns. These dispatches of
Consul-General Lee are being filed by the
State Department for consideration in
connection with the report of the Court
of Inquiry when that body shall have
submitted the result of its labors to the
Navy Department.
KEY WEST, Fla., Feb. 28.â it was rumored here to
day that the dynamite-gun vessel Vesuvius had been or
dered to Key West. I asked Admiral Sicard this afternoon
whether the report was true. He shook his head and re
plied that it was one of the questions he was not at liberty
to answer. Admiral Sicard was equally reticent when I
spoke to him concerning the report that he was packing his
trunks preparatory to relinquishing the command of the
squadron on account of ill-health.
" I cannot speak concerning my health," he said.
Great activity prevails here upon coast defenses. The
torpedo system of harbor defense is practically completed
now. A report, which I am unable to confirm, says two
companies of artillery are en route here and will arrive to
morrow to aid in mounting the guns and shore batteries.
Captain Merrill's artillery force now here numbers only
about one hundred men.
I can state from a most authoritative source that the
mortar batteries included in the plans of fortifications which
have been in course of construction at this point in the last
year will be ready for use to-morrow. Ido not mean that
they will be entirely completed to-morrow, but will be
ready for immediate use and for all practical purposes
within twenty-four hours in the event that any emergency
should arise.
Specifications for this work contemplate the protection
of these mortars principally with sand, the material for
which could be obtained when desired at short notice.
Work on the gun batteries is being pushed rapidly. They
are in such advanced state that the guns could be mounted
in position if they were here.

LONDON, March I.â The Daily News commenting Tltorially this
morning on the relations between the United States a j Spain says:
"Spain can expect no support, moral or otherwise, I om England
against the United States. She has ruined Cuba, as â  .ie has ruined
or lost every colony, by the grossest corruption, cruel T, and malad
ministration, and she must be left to settle the accouiÂ»i for it with
those whom it may concern, without any aid or syrofi^Uiy on our
part."
The Standard, In an editorial on the same genera .. topic, highly
praises President McKinley's statesmanlike moderation nd recognizes
that "it would be only human nature that proof of t Maine's hav
ing been blown up from the outside should engender a 'angerous war
feeling in America."
The Naval Court of Inquiry
into the Maine disaster made
good progress to-day in
taking the evidence of the
surviving officers now in Key
West
The session began prompt
ly at 10 o'clock in the morn
ing in the private room of
the United States Circuit
Judge, opening from the Fed-j
eral Court room. As Captain
Sampson, Captain Chadwick ;
and Lieutenant Commander ;
Potter, resplendent in their
full uniforms, walked over
from the Naval Stores build
ing to the Federal building,
which adjoins it, their digni- !
fied bearing was that of offi
cers who realize to the full
measure the magnitude of the
responsibility resting upon
them.
Lieutenant Commander Ma
rix, judge-advocate of the
court, joined them a moment
later, and the court prepared
to resume its sessions. The
apartments devoted to the
Naval Court are directly
above the postoffice. Many
newspaper correspondents
already thronged the corri
dors, and many Key West
citizens, thoroughly alive to
the importance of the occa
sion, had pushed their way
in from the area in front of
the postoffice.
Everybody showed a dis
position to respect the secrecy
of the court and all kept at
a respectful distance from the
doors of the Federal Court
rooms. Captain Sampson

of the fine fellows who sur
vived from the Marine Corps

West session immediately
began.
These witnesses in the or
der named were heard during
the morning session : Lieu

the explosion ; Lieutenants

The afternoon session was
brief. The board reconvened
a few minutes after 2 o'clock
and adjourned for the day
shortly after half-past 3. The
witnesses examined in the
afternoon were ; Lieutenant
Holman, who was recalled for
a few minutes to simplify
some points in his testimony ;
First Lieutenant of Marines
Catlin and three of the war
rant officers, Gunner Hill,
Boatswain Larkin and Car

disaster.

it is believed some of them
were questioned particularly
as to whether they heard and
felt two distinct explosions.
It is not thought any of the
evidence to be taken here can
add materially to the court's
knowledge as to the vital
question â the origin of the
explosion. It is quite likely
one, or at most two more
days may suffice to hear the
testimony of all the other
survivors now here whose
evidence is regarded as worth
hearing. The men of the
Maine, under orders of Ad
miral Sicard, will then prob
ably go north and await the
further pleasure of the Navy
Department, though some of
them, it is not unlikely, will
be detailed almost imme
diately for duty on other
ships.

SOME OF THE DEAD

IN AMERICAN SOIL
Public .Opinion Moves the War
Department to Make an Effort
to Ship the Bodies to
Key West.
Copyrighted, 189S, by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, Feb. 28.â Some of the
brave boys of the Maine, after all,
are to sleep in American soil and un
der the Stars and Stripes. All the
bodies hereafter taken from the
wreck are to be sealed hermetically
in metal coffins, placed aboard the
Coast Survey steamer Bache and
brought to Key West for burial. Or
ders to that effect were received from
the Navy Department in Washington
to-day by Captain Forsythe, com
mandant at Key West, and were
transmitted to Captain Sigsbee in
Havana.
In accordance with the same or
der, arrangements have been made
for a suitable lot in Key West Ceme
tery, where all the bodies of seamen
hereafter recovered are to be interred.
The disinterment and removal of the j
bodies already buried in Havana, I
understand, are not contemplated, at
least at present. Captain Sigsbee and j
Lieutenant-Commander Wainwiight
have notified the department that the
identification of the bodies yet to be
recovered will be practically impos- i
sible, except in the cases of Lieuten
ant Jenkins and Assistant Engineer
Merritt, who, it is thought, may yet
be identified by their uniform. So
strong a feeling has been manifest
throughout the country against per
mitting all thesa noble American sea
men to be buried in Spanish soil that
the department has thought it best
to bury them at Key West, even
though not identified. The seemingly
slow work of the divers hitherto on
the task of recovering the dead has
caused great disappointment among
surviving officers, especially Chap- j
lain Chadwick. Every day for nearly j
a week the floating morgue in Ha- j
vaaa harbor has swung with the j
tida, bearing its pile of metal coffins |
ready for use, and above the rest two
just a little less plain than the oth
ers. These were intended for the j
bodies of the two dead officers. But :
the recovery of bodies has proceeded ;
very slowly.
There is some disposition to find
fault with the work of the divers,
anyhow. Many souvenirs from the
wardroom, messroom and other parts
of the ship have been brought to the
surface. They are common enough j
now in Havana. Pieces of the mess
room table, I am told, are now being,
made into walking-canes for a fa
vored few.
Biordan, the diver who was ac
cused of pilfering from sea chests, is
said to have found comparatively
easy access to many parts of the
wreck, yet up to the time I lrft Ha
vana yesterday on the Herald-Call
dispatch boat, Albert F. Dewey, from
fifty to sixty dead seamen, according
to Chaplain Chadwick's estimate, re
mained in the wreck, many of them,
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
it is said, still in their hammocks
where they died.
Considerable jealousy and not a
little animosity has begun to develop
between the naval divers attached to
the squadron and those employed by
the wrecking company, which is en
gaged upon the work of salvage at
a stated price per day. The impres
sion conveyed by careless dispatches
to some New York papers that among
the divers at work above and in the
wreck are some who are Spaniards is
wholly without foundation. The de
partment's decision to conduct the in
vestigation without Spanish assist
ance has been adhered to strictly.
The only Spaniards employed about
the wreck in any capacity whatever
are sailors of the Spanish cruiser Al
fonso XIII, who still maintain most
efficiently their watchful guard
about the wreck alike by day and
night, to keep off intruders and mor
bid curiosity-seekers. How well they
do their duty I had reason to know,
when, in a small boat, half an hour
before midnight. 1 started to board
the Herald-Call dispatch boat for her
run to Key West, which began early
yesterday morning. The Dewey lay
moored near the wreck of the Maine.
Our path toward her from Machina
wharf lay near the dispatch vessel Le
Gaspi. I was challenged all along the
line from the wharf to the Dewey,
first from Le Gaspi's deck and again
by two floating patrol boats around
tne wreck of the Maine.
Just as I boarded the Herald's
fleet little tug eight bells sounded
musically, first from the cruiser Ai
fonso XIII, then Le Gaspi and then
like a silvery echo from our little
Fern. The ships' bells were playing
a midnight requiem of dead men-of
warsmen. Then from far-off Ca
banas came ringing clear, musical,
across the still waters, the cry
"Alerta" of the Spanish sentinel.
Back came the answer in sailorlike
singsong from Le Gaspi's deck, and
again "Bote alerta" from the patrol
that swung slowly at their oars
around the wreck.
Yes, they were all alert.
So was the fleet little Dewey. Her
steam was already up, and long be
fore sunrise she was off past Morro
light, past the gray wreck looking
gloomier than ever in the first dim
light of the dawn, and headed
straight for Key West like an arrow
to give the Herald readers the latest
news of Havana, despite Spanish cen
sors and despite stormy seas.

IS NOW ON
THE RAMPAGE
Navy and War Departments Deluged With
Offers of Aid While Cranks Volun

NEW YORK, Feb. 28.â A "Washington special to the Herald says:
That there is a great deal of hot blood in the United States, which
throbs with impatient determination to support the administration if
developments shall compel us to adopt a hostile attitude toward
Spain, is evidenced by the hundreds of letters received since the
Maine disaster, at the White House and the War and Navy depart
ments, offering services and suggestions. These letters come from all
sorts and conditions of men, women and children in all parts of the
country. Many are from men of standing and influence whose ser
vices would be appreciated in the event of the outbreak of hostilities.
Among those are officers of the National Guard organizations, who
pledge their willingness and that of their entire regiments to enlist as
a body in the service of the United States In case of emergency.
Many medical men have tendered their services an army and navy
Burgeons. Men and women nurses, some of them attached to hos
pitals in large cities, are begging the authorities to call them if need
ed, and scores of boys from 10 to 15 years old are clamoring for per
mission to enlist as drummer boye.
There are numerous applications for authority to recruit volun
teers. The number of former Confederate soldiers who offer their
services is especially large. As might be expected under the circum
stance? people totally ignorant of military methods and cranks, form
a large part of the overzealous patriots. One man requests the Pres
ident to send him immediately a cap, belt and uniform, that he may
open a recruiting office in Philadelphia. This man says he is able to
command any number of men, but would be content with a captain's
commission.
An old colored man of Alexandria, Va., says he is prepared to en
list more than seven hundred colored soldiers who fought in the late
war, and asks for a colonel's commission.
Many superannuated inmates of the soldiers' homes are with diffi
culty restraining themselves from marching in a body to Washington
to tender their services to the President. An enthusiastic mechanical
engineer has presented an elaborate, but impracticable, scheme for
barricading harbors and rivers with fortified pontoons. Another man,
ready for his country's call, styles himself a professional aeronaut
of ten" years' experience, "well versed in hydrogen gas and hot air
balloons." He suggests the employment of large quantities of nitro
glycerine and other high explosives to be carried up in balloons and
dropped upon decks of the enemy's ships.
The signal office of the War Department is deluged with plans of
war balloons, all of which have some fatal defect. A large number of
applications have been received from men desirous of entering the
navy in the event of war with Spain. The department has notified
its correspondents that their applications have been filed. But the
applicants for enlistment do not confine their applications to letters.
Some of them apply personally to the department. The department
does not enlist men and they are always referred to Norfolk, Philadel
phia or New York.
Captain Charles O'Neill, chief of the Bureau of Navigation, is con
vinced from crank letters he has received that there is a shell that
"<an pierce any armor afloat, an armor that can keep out any shells
tha^ have been or may be invented, that there are ships which can
no/ be destroyed by torpedoes or other means, and finally torpedoes
hsvf> been invented which will sink any vessel attempting to enter
United States harbors. Some cranks have put springs behind their
armor and declared that*the effect of a shell striking it would be to
soften the effect of a blow, to compress the springs, and finally to hurl
the projectile back upon the enemy with a force which will cause his
destruction. There is an inventor who puts a magnet in a torpedo
which lies along the shore. A steel ship passing through the channel
draws the torpedo up to its side, and an explosion follows^nd thjt ship
sinks.
lay recovered Captain Sigsbee' s Order
of the Red Eagle, given him by Em
peror William I of Germany, on ac
rount of deep sea inventions, and the
<old medal given him by the Fisheries
Commission at London in 1889. Cap
rain Sigsbee was most anxious about
:hese. They are in good condition.
The Chapman wrecking experts will
:o-morrow make an examination of the
jvreck to decide whether the vessel can
be raised by means of driving piles and
making a cofferdam. It is now thought
that such work is impossible and could
only be done at an enormous cost. It
is not believed this will be necessary
for the purpose of the Board of In
quiry.
The work to-day was done by the
divers from the tug Right Arm. Cap
tain McGee, who is in charge, seems
to lark authority from the wrecking
people or others, and is indisposed 10
work on his own judgment, except in
smaller details.
Captain Sigsbee was on board the
United States lighthouse tender Fern
uncil 2 o'clock this afternoon. He wait
ed for the Spanish divers, but fliey did
not pppear. Captain Sigsbee thinks
Spain has a moral and international
right to make an independent examina
tion and he will give the Spanish divers
snch facilities as are possible.
Captain Sigsbee hopes the survey
steamer Bache will return to the Tor
tugas to-morrow or the next day, with
all the Maine's wounded left here, and
he also hopes to send on the Bache
hereafter all the remains of the dca 1 re
covered in a condition making it possi
ble to place them in coffins.
The difficulty experienced in recov
ering the bodies 13 not understood by
any but the divers. The latter yester
day worked for three hours trying to
bring out one body intact, and one of
the divers had a bad fall and several
got their air tubes tangled. Even then
they could not extricate the remains.
The principal efforts of the divers now
are directed toward clearing the upper
wreckage, smokestacks docks, guns,
hatches, bridges, cranes and grating?.
Then, if not before, a!! the iead can
be removed.
Captain Sigsbee continues to receive
letters in great numbers. All the
queries about the men who lost their
lives when the Maine was blown up
are answered as soon as possible if there
is anything to be told. One of the sad
dest letters received by Captain Sigs
bee was from the brother of a dead
man, who wrote that when death was
claiming the victim his friends at home
were celebrating his birthday and wish
ing him many happy returns of the day.
Chaplain Chidwick has been com
mended by Captain Sigsbee as a man,
a priest and an officer. He is always
cheerful and is doing the most effective
work possible.
Senator Proctor had expected to pay
his personal respects to Captain Gen
eral Blanco to-day, in company with
his traveling companion, Colonel Par
ker, and Consul Genera! Lee, but the
Captain General has been unusually
busy in getting ready for the outgoing
mails, and has fixed 1 o'clock to-mor
row for Senator Proctor's call.
Only one body has been recovered
to-day, and it has not yet been identi
fied With any others recovered in
time, it will go with Me wouuded cm
the Bache to the Dry Tortugas and
Key West. On the next trip north the
Bache will carry to Key West the first
company of wounded taken to Dry Tor-
togas.
The Spanish divers did not make
their examination to-day. Captain Sigs
bee expected them and probably will be
advised to-day as to when they will be
gin their investigation.
Lieutenant Commander Wainwright.
the executive officer of the Maine, whc
was almost worn out with constant
work on the wreck, had a good rest
yesterday and says he feels now like a
new man. Captain Sigsbee reported
that the work of the divers to-day was
slow and must necessarily continue
slow, owing to the difficulty of mak
ing an impression on the mass ofMieavy
debris. But they are doing the best
they can.
Late to-day Captain McGee of the
tug Right Arm received orders from
the contractors to hire such lighters as
are necessary to, remove the debris
from the wreck. This will facilitate the
work of removing the dead and gen
erally hasten operations.
Senator Proctor, who passed most of
the day indoors, writing private letters
and reading, says his visit will be too
brief to make his observations of any
interest to the public and therefore he
has nothing to offer for publication.
La Lucha publishes, late this even
ing, an official dispatch giving an ac
count of a battle in the province of
Puerto Principe, in which the insur
gents are said to have lost 181 killed
and wounded.
According to the dispatch, the bat
tle took place February 18 and 10, in
and near the Santa Inez and Hinoioa
hills. The Spanish force, which was
under the command of Geneial Jimine7
Castellanos. numbered 2400 infantry and
400 cavalry. The insurgents numbered
3000. The insurgents left 87 dead on
the field. Among the killed were Colo
nel Alvaro Rodriguez, Commandant
Angol Roccio and other officers. Ac
cording to the dispatch, the Spaniards
lost one officer. Lieutenant Porajo, and
seven soldiers killed and three officers
and seventy-three soldiers wounded.
The Spanish troops are said to have
captured many weapons, a large quan
tity of ammunition and thirty-four
horses.
SENATOR HANNA BELIEVES
THE DISASTER AN ACCIDENT.
Denies That He Went to New York
to Sound Wall Street on a
War Bond Issue.
NEW YORK, Feb. 28.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Senator
Hanna denied to me very emphatically
to-night that his recent visit to New
York had any particular significance.
He pronounced as entirely groundless
the report that he went to sound the
temper of Wall street on the subject of
a bond issue for war purposes. Sena
tor Hanna said to me: "You may state
positively that the administration is j
not contemplating an issue of bonds
on any account at this time. It fails '
to see occasion for such action. My ,

The atmosphere of New York was
calm and rational among all classes of
people on Saturday, and I find a simi

Ever since the destruction of the
Maine I have been unable to reconcile
myself to any theory except that the
disaster was the result of an accident,
and I am confident that the Naval
Court of Inquiry will so report. I am
not speculating on the future attitude
of the administration in the matter. It
will depend on whether the responsi
bility for 'the accident to the battle
ship can be traced in any way to Span

disaster was the result of Spanish
negligence or an act of an Irresponsible
fanatic the administration will con

The whole matter Is in suspense, and

An officer of the Maine

" I can't tell you," he said,

the explosion was of internal

SPAIN PLEADING
FOR FURTHER TIME.
Wants Until the Ist of May to
End the Cruel Warfare in
Stricken Cuba.
NEW YORK, Feb. 28.â A dispatch
to a morning paper from Washington
Bays: The American Government
made an ultimatum to Spain some
time ago to the effect that un
less autonomy was successfully estab
lished in Cuba by March 1, the United
States Government would be compelled
to act. It Is known to a chosen few
here and to all the diplomats in Europe
that Spain is making every effort to
have an additional respite of two
months granted. She wants to put off
the day o; accounting until the Ist of
May. and negotiations to that end are
gome: on in Washington now.
Spain is doing her utmost to secure
this extension of time. It iB plain that
autonomy has been the worst kind of
a failure and March 1 is the day on
which our ultimatum expires. The de
struction of the Maine has added to the
complications. President McKinley be
ing desirous of establishing the respon
sibii' for the explosion before taking
final action on the subject of autonomy.
Nevertheless Spain has not ceased her
efforts to obtain the respite until May
1. nnn* negotiations to that end are now
actively going on.

LONDON, Feb. 28â The Carllst or
gan El Coreo of Madrid, In its issue of
February 22, just received here by mail,
says: "There is no doubt whatever
that the loss of the Maine was due to
lack of discipline." and cites the case
of a United States cruiser which was
lately at Venice, describing her crew as
being rather pirate* than .sailors of a
civilized nation. wk
Continuing, El Â£Â«?eo says: "Drunk

ers, the sailors of the United States
never set foot .ishore without creating
riots. Nightly several of them slept in
jail or were taken on board under ar
rest until the municipality was forced
to really complain to the commander
and request him not to allow his men
to land, as otherwise they could not be
answerable for the consequences. Had
these officials belonged to the Chris
tina regime the United States would
have replied by demanding an indem
nity or an apology or both, with tne
certainty of obtaining it. But the pro
test not being Spanish no attention was
paid to it. This naval convict ship
which is never free from the fumf-s of
alcohol, must be a twin sister of the
Maine. It is a marvelous thing in
such hands as these that a ship does
not blow up daily."
The Impartial of February 25 ap
proves the growing sentiment that
"concession has reached its limits, and
expresses the belief that 'the best
forces in Spain are convinced that trie
time has arrived to firmly, though with
moderation and calmness, assert the

piece of news brought by her officers

EASTEBN VIEWS EXHIBITED.
The Camera Club Entertained by
Slides From Philadelphia and
Brooklyn.
The Snn Franrtsco Camera Club was
entertained last night at the club rooms
in the Academy of Sciences building by
the exhibition of 109 views which were
produced on canvas by stereoscopic
means. This collection was contributed
by the American I,antern Slide Inter
change Society In Philadelphia with some
from Brooklyn, N. V., photographic insti
tute. The effect was everything that could
be desired, as each slide was produced
with perfect regularity and clearness that
made the scents as plain and home-like
as if a person was on the ground ana
saw the places am 1 things wtth the naked
eye. The cruiser Brooklyn was the first
to be thrown on the canvas ano so plain
did she appear that one would imagine
that he was alongside of the vessel.
Several views of Niagara Falls, Mount
Vernon. the tomb of Washington and
other well-known scenes of the Atlantic
imports, farms and farming in New
England, wiih elegant residences of some
of the Eastern millionaires, were given.
Fell From Telegraph Hill.
An unknown Chinaman, evidently a la
borer, was found in an unconscious con
dition lying at the foot of Telegraph Hil!
at the corner of Sansome and Union
streets last evening by Officers Grunwald
and Deueer. He was taken to the Harbor
Receiving Hospital, where it was found
that he had a severe scalp wound and
internal injuries. After treatment the
man revived to a certain extent, but was
in such pain that he could give no ex
planation as to how he received his In
juries, but it is believed that he either fell
or was thrown from the summit of the
hill.
EXTENDING FOLSOM STREET.
United Action of Improvement Clubs
Organized for the Purpose.
Precita Valley and Cortland-avenue
Improvement clubs have unite! their
forces on the one common objectâ that
of securing the extension of Folsom
street through Bernal Heights from Pre
cita avenue to Cortland avenue, a dis
tance of three blocks. The opening of
these blocks and the continuation of the
Folsnm-street electric cars through to
Cortland avenue would bo considered of
great advantage to the residents of that
section.
As it now Is. the people there are com
pelled to walk a mile or more to get to
the Mission-street line. This they con
sider a great hardship, and. Inasmuch as
the maiority of them are hard-working
men. wlio have to be at their work early
In the morning and kite at night, a walk
of a mile from the cars to their homes
is not considered a luxury by any means.
Jn addition to this, they are anxious to
have a chemical engine stationed some
where in the vicinity of their homes
west of Precita Valley.
The lack of sufficient water for domes
tic purposes is felt both In Precita Val
ley and In the Cortland-avenue district.
The question has been (repeatedly asked
of the Spring Valley AVnter Company,
why, with a reservoir within n few hun
dred yards of the HetUement, a sufficient
supply Is not provided for domestic use?
Buf to this inquiry no answer has been
given. The two clubs are united in the
endeavor to solicit the aid of the Super
visors in getting a sufficient supply of
water from the obstinate company, and
to this end a Joint committee has been
appointed for this purpose from both
clubs.
WELSH WILL CELEBRATE.

ble one in the history of the society and
its members.
The interior of the hall has been elabo
rately decorated with bunting, flags and
the insignia of the Cymrodorions. A fea
ture of the programme will be a number
of short addresses to be delivered by

Joseph Greenbaum's Successful Ex-
hibition of His Work.

Misfortunes Caused Pity.
The story surrounding the life and
dpÃth of M. O'l^eary. a cooper by occupa
tion, has aroused a feeling of sympathy
nmnng the members of the Coopers'
T'nion. Some time pa=t O'Leary sustained
an Injury to the right arm, which re
sulted in its a.Tnputatlon. The union was
called together, and the members pro
cured sufficient funds to build the un
fortunate man and his family a little
home on the corner of Fourth and Chan
nel streets, and in the front portion a
cigar store was fitted up and stocked.
But a few days ago O'Leary was at
tacked with pneumonia, from which he
died.
The union will continue to. aid the mem
bers of the family, as they are in
straitened circumstances.
Fair Will Contest.
Next Friday argument will be heard by
Judge Slack on a motion introduced by
Charles Fair, through his attorneys, in
his contest of the alleged last will of his
father, James G. Fair. Charles Fair asks
the court to reissue a citation to appear
to the heirs of the deceased Senator and
to the legatees under his alleged last will
so the contest may proceed. The attor
neys representing both sides of the case
appeared in court yesterday morning, but
on motion of contestant's counsel the case
was continued till Friday.
Hit With a Brick.
Joseph Lopez, saloon-keeper, 408 Pacific
street, swore to a complaint in Judge
Conlan's court yesterday for' the arrest
of Sam Brown, a colored man, on the
charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
Lopez alleges-- that Brown and 'two other
colored men have had a grudge against
him for some time and early last Tuesday
morning they entered the saloon and
raised â  disturbance. Brown threw a
brick which struck him on the head In-
Hletlng- a wound that required thirteen
stitches. Since then Lopez had been con
fined to his hod.
The Masonic Home.
Crescent Court of the Order of Amar
anth, which is connected with the Order
of the Eastern Star, will this evening
give an entertainment in Native Sons'
Hall In aid of the Masonic Widows' and
Orphans" Home, now being built in De
coto, Alameda County. A number of
first-class amateurs and several profes
sionals have volunteered to present for
the occasion "A Lesson In Whist." "That
Moloch Society" and "Angela," all of
which are the plays of George W. and
Helene Ripley Walt how.
SHE WAS CERTAINLY PREPARED.
A minister's wife, who is not so
seriously minded at all times as her
husband is tells some laughable
stories relating to marriage ceremonies
which he performed while they were
living in a small village in the Mid
lands. The minister always felt it his
duty to give each young couple a little
serious advice before he performed the
marriage ceremony, and for this pur
pose he usually took them aside one
at a time and talked very soberly to
each of them regarding the importance
of the step they were to take and the
new responsibilities they were to as
sume.
One day he talked in his most ear
nest manner for several minutes to a
young woman who had come to be
married. "And now," he said, in clos
ing. "I hope you fully realize the ex
treme importance of the step you are
taking and that you are prepared for
it?"
"Prepared," she said, innocently;
"well, if I ain't prepared I don't know
who Is. I've got four common quilts
and two nice ones, and four brand
new feather beds, ten sheets and
twelve pairs of pillow-slips, four linen
tablecloths, a dozen spoons and a good
six-quart kettle. If I ain't prepared no
girl in .the country ever was." â Euro
pean Journal.
The Royal table-linen Is of the nneat
substance, and is specially manufactur
ed. The designs woven in are very
handsome and elaborate, the Queen's
monogram predominating, with roses,
shamrocks, and thistles among armo
rial bearings. It is also made in sets,
each tablecloth having a number of
serviettes to match it in design.
MANUFACTURERS
AND CAPITALISTS
CONSIDER DEFENSE
Cities of Newport and Providence Start a
Plan for Each State in the Union to
Present Uncle Sam With
a Warship.
+ BOSTON, Feb. 28.â An informa 1 talk of much significance on naval -Â¥
+ defense took place between several of the largest cotton manufactur- -f
+ ers and capitalists on the Providence Board of Trade to-day. It is â¦
+ well known that the cities of Newport and Providence would be at the +
â¦ mercy of a foreign country in time of war, and it would be only a â¦
-f question of a few days when one of the modern ships of war would de- +
â¦ stroy "thousands of dollars' worth of property. The men who were â¦
4- present are full of patriotism and are determined to leave no stone un- â¢â¦â¢
â¦ turned In order to serve the interests of the Government, and at the â¦
â¦ same time to protect the Interests of the State of Rhode Island. Ac- â¦
â¦ cording to the opinion of a leading naval expert, a gunboat could : â¦
â¦ come up the Providence River and in an hour's time the business +
â¦ section of the city would be razed to the ground. In view of the fact â¦
â¦ that our navy is not sufficiently large to take care of the immense â¦
â¦ stretch of valuable property on the coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific >
+ oceans, the business men of this city have given the matter serious â¦
â¦ thought and they have a solution. It is for each State in the Union +
+ to present the Government a ship of war. The sentiment seemed to be +
+ that the city of Providence and its valuable property ought not to be +
+ at the mercy of any foreign country. One of the men present ad- +
+ vanced the idea of a popular subscription by the business men and +
+ citizens of the State for the purpose of purchasing a suitable ship of +
â¦ war to defend the State coast line in case of war with Spain. In sup- â¦
+ port of this argument it was said that the necessary amount could be +
â¦ raised in twenty-four hours by a popular subscription from the pat- â¦
â¦ riotic citizens. The man-of-war could be manned by the Naval Re- â¦
â¦ serves, who, with competent and experienced officers, would give a good â¦
â¦ account of themselves. Among the largest contributors would proba- â¦
â¦ bly be the Knights, Qoddards, Sayles, Perkins, Tafts, Browns and al- â¦
+ most all of the cliff dwellers at Newport. â¦

HALE AND NORCROSS CASE.
A Branch of This Suit Heard in the
Supreme Court.
A branch of the famed Hale and Nor
cross suit was up before the Justices of
the Supreme Court yesterday. It was in
the shape of an argument on the petition
of M. ML Fox. the president of the min
ing company, for a writ < >f â upwodeÂ»Â».
Some time ago G. \V. Grayson. one of
the stockholders of the company, brought
a suit against the officers of the com
pany to have set aside their action by
which they sold 20,000 share" of his stock
for delinquent assessment' Superior
Judge Daingerneld gave .. mem for
Grayson and ordered the <>m .â -â¢. â -â¢ of the
company to transfer the stock >ack to
the plaintiff. The president refused to
obey the order of the court and he was i
cited â â  for contempt of court. From this
order Fox appealed to the Supreme Court,
but before the day set for hearing this
matter he petitioned for a writ of super
sedeas and a citation was issued.
It was this branch that was argued be
fore the court yesterday and Fox con
tended that unless a restraining order j
was made he would be punished for con- i
tempt. And further that his appeal was ,
properly taken.* in other words that the ,
order of re-transfer was an appealable
matter. Grayson's contention was ; * : that
the order was not appealable, and.thnt
the appeal of the president was only for j
delay. The annual meeting of officers,
he said, will be held soon and unless some
action Is taken by the court at once to j
make Fox re-transfer the stock he (Gray- ]
son) cannot vote his stock nor can he sell ]
or transfer it. The matter was taken
under advisement.
A Prospective Convention.
Judging from a letter to the Chamber
of Commerce the Young Men's Western
Business League, headquarters at Moun
tain Grove. Mo., contemplates holding a
convention or something of the kind and
that San Francisco may be the place
selected for the gathering. The letter was
from Michael Glenn, the general manager,
who desired explicit information as to
what are the largest halls this city af
fords and the rental of the same and
similar knowledge. The information will
be given by Secretary Scott. The league
seems to be an extensive organization,
fur it has branches in Illinois. Ohio. In
diana. Nebraska, Kansas. Texas. Colo
rado. Arkansas. New Mexico. Oklahoma
and this State.
Women's Press Association.
Shasta Hall in Native Sons' building
was comfortably filled with a very ap
preciative audience yesterday afternoon
at the open meeting of the Pacific Coast
Women's Press Association. The paper
of the day was read by Miss Mary Ellis
of the faculty of Mills College, and was
entitled, "Recent Archaeological Dis
coveries in Greece." After the paper
many questions were asked from tlio au
dience and answered at length by Miss
Ellis. J.me. Guido Spitzy sang Pinsuti's
"Book of l'rayer." accompanied by Pro
fessor Ziliani, with violin obligate* by
Miss Knox, and as an encore gave "For
All Eternity," by Mascheroni. with the
same accompaniment. An hour was then
spent in social converse "over the tea
cups."

STOLE FROM LIVERYMEN.
Sam Price, a Teamster, Will Have
Several Charges of Burglary to
Answer for.
Several complaints having recently been
received at police headquarters from llv
t-ry-stable men about a thief who had
been stealing harness and feed from their
barns. Detective Cody was detailed to
make an investigation.
Yesterday afternoon he arrested Sam
Price, a teamster, and booked him at the
city I'rison on a charge of burglary. The
complaining witness is Oscar Herzog, who
had a set of harness belonging to him
stolen from the W'oodlawn stables, 62;J
Grove street, last Thursday night. Cody
ascertained that the harness had been
sold at Meyers' second-hand store on Mis
sion street, near Fourteenth, by Price and
the warrant was sworn out for his ar
rest.
P. J. Corbett. the livery-stable man on
Hayes street, will also swear out a war
rant against Price for stealing a largÂ«
quantity of feed from his barn. Price
used to hide himself among the hay till
the barn was closed up for the night and
would then slide the feed down the
manure chute and Slide down u_f*c-r ir.
It is said that other complaints will be
made against Price.
The police say that Price has about
$10,000 deposited in the Hibernia Bank and
a good deal of it has been made by steal
ing from other people. He is a com
paratively young man.

"THE PUBLIC
CAN GO TO
THE DEVIL"
Fhat Is the Fervid if Somewhat
Discourteous Observation
of Mr, Boutelle.
No Business to Know What Is Being Done
in the Way of Emergency Legislation
by the Committees of Congress,
NEW YORK, Feb. 28.â A
Washington special to the Her
ald says: According to Repre
sentative Boutelle of Maine the
people of the United States have
no right to know what prepara
tions, if any, are to be made for
the defense of the country. His
idea is that they should trust
everything to Mr. Houtelie and
not make fÂ»uy inquiries as to
whether t' committee: over
which he presides proposes .to
pay any attention to the request
of the administration for author-,
ity to enlist additional men for
the navy and make other emer
gency appropriations.
Referring to this anxiety on
the part of the public to know
what was to be done in the way
of emergency legislation, Mr.
Boutelle in conversation with me
y exclaimed with much im
patience:
"Tne puDJic can go to tne aevu.
He had not yet recovered from his
indignation over the presumption of
the Assistant Secretary of the Navy
in darins; to write him a letter request
ing legislation which the President and
the Secretary of the Navy desire. He
would not say anything as to what
course he proposed to favor in the com
mittee. He intimated that no emer
p^nry legislation whatever would be
reported, bill that the additional men
asked for by the Secretary would prob
ably be provided for in the regular ap-
When that bill will
get through < 'ongress is a matter no
one can predict and should the coun
try, in the meantime, be suddenly
plunged into war. Mr. Boutelle will not
be entirely free from responsibility for
inability of the Navy Department
to put into immediate service ships
â which are now laid up for lack of men
to form their crews.
< in* 3 reason, perhaps, why Mr. Bou
telle think? the legislation asked by
the Navy Department is of so little im
portance is that he clings tenaciously
to the theory that the Maine was de
stroyed by an accident and ridicules all
dispatches from Havana and Key
"West tending to show that evidences
have been discovered which indicate
that thf explosion was not accidental.
He eager accepts Senor DuÃosc's
statement that there are no mines in
Havana harbor as conclusive on that
point.
While Mr. Boutelle is doing all in h
power to prevent any action that wou
give the navy an immediate increa
in the number of men, Mr. Hull
lowa, chairman of the Committee o
Military Affairs, is trying in every wa
to advance the bill providing for tw
new regiments of artillery which M
Sulzer blocked in the House last Fr
day. He had hoped to get the bill b
fore the House to-day after the pa
sage of the sundry civil appropriate
bill, but so little time was left that it
was impossible to get it in to-day. To
morrow, Wednesday and Thursday are
to be devoted to the Loud postal bill,
snd Friday is private bill day. Mr.
Hull believes he can displace the pri
vate calendar for two hours on Fri
day, however, and thus get the bill .
through on that day.
He told me to-day he was confident )
he would have no difficulty in secur- i
ing the special order for which he has
asked, and he believes the order will
be adopted by the House in spite of
the objections of some men interested
in the private calendar.
The efforts of Mr. Uailey and some
of the other leading Democrats to mak^
the artillery bill a party question are '
not meeting with entire success. Many
Democrats will rebel against this and j
will vote for the bill. One of these
men said to me to-day: "If that j
course is persisted in and we should j

OPERATIONS OF THE
BOLD FILIBUSTERS.
In Response to a Resolution Secre
tary Gage Submits a Report
to Congress.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28.â The report
of the Secretary of \ the Treasury on
the Government's efforts to prevent
Cuban filibustering operations and the
results and expense, in response to a
Resolution of inquiry, was sent to the
House to -way. Â :
Secretary Gage says that nothing
has been done by the Treasury Depart
ment to prevent the conveyance, in ac
cordance with law, to the residents of
Cuba, of articles produced in the
United States, and that the department
has put forth its best efforts to prevent
the departure of vessels for Cuba in
violation of acts of Congress applicable
to such cases. The results of these en
deavors, he says, has been generally
successful. He incloses a report dated
November 30, 1897, covering the de
partment's operations concerning fili
bustering expeditions up to that date,
which was published at the time in a
supplementary statement bringing the
matter up to date, and a reply of De
cember. 14 last to a Senate resolution
1 as to violations of the neutrality laws.
Owing to the time that would be re
quired to learn the cost of this work
to the department, that information is
not transmitted at this time. The fili
bustering cases since November 30 are
given as those of the Dauntless, Tillie
and De Agramonte.
FILIBUSTER DAUNTLESS
STEAMS INTO PORT.
No Evidence Found Aboard, but the

made another bold movement at mid
night last night by creeping up St.
John River and tying up at her dock
The officers of the Vesuvius at day
light beheld alongside their ship the
well-known craft that they had been
awaiting for several days. A boat's
crew from the warship made a thor
ough search of the Dauntless.
Captain Floyd of the tug gave every
aid in the search and stated soberly
that he had been towing in Southern
waters, and that except for contrary
winds he would have been in Jack
sonville Saturday. Evidences were
found of a large supply of coal, but
otherwise the tug's hold was bare. Hei
sides and smokestack showed evidences
of rough weather and there was plenty
of signs that she had been in waters
further south. The men on board,
however, would tell no tales. It Is re
ported here to-night that the Govern
ment will order the seizure of the
Dauntless to-morrow, as the Collector
Is said to have received orders to that
effect from Washington late this aft

last few days. It needed only a spark
to kindle a great conflagration, and
the patient and dignified bearing of
the executive and legislative bodies are
all the more commendable in view of
the mischievous and intemperate ut
terances of some sensational newspa
pers.
"This nation is too brave, too strong,
too powerful and too just to engage in
an unrighteous or precipitate war. Let
us remember that the eyes of the world
are upon us, whose judgment we can
not despise, and that we will gain more
applause and credit for ourselves fey
calm deliberation and masterly inac
tivity than by recourse to arms.
"I hope and believe, for the honor of
humanity, that the destruction of the
Maine was caused by an accident, and
in that case Spain cannot be responsi
ble. But suppose some fiendish Cuban !
had occasioned this fearful loss of life â 
in order to embroil our nation in a war :
with his mother country. In that case I
Spain should not be held responsible. !
And even had some fanatical Spaniard j
perpetrated this atrocious crime, there I
would be no necessity for a recourse i
to the arbitrament of the sword.
"The only circumstance that would
warrant active hostilities would be evi
dence that the Spanish Government
connived at the placing of torpedoes
or explosives in the harbor of Havana
to destroy our vessel. But I do not be
lieve, and no sane man can believe, that
a chivalric nation would be guilty of
such inhumanity.
"An able commission has been ap
pointed by the Government to inves
tigate the cause of the disaster. Let
us calmly and dispassionately await
the result of their verdict and not an
ticipate their judgment. One thing is
certain: This country knows how, in
any emergency, to defend her honor
and protect her interests.
"These brave men did not die, indeed,
on the deck of the ship, with weapons
in their hands. Nevertheless, we must
regard them as heroes or martyrs to
this country, who died at the ppst to
which the call to duty assigned them. I
earnestly hope that the day is not far
off when a grateful nation will show
her appreciation of the services of
those brave and faithful public ser
vants by erecting to their memory a
suitable monument â a monument
which will not only commemorate the
dead, but which will be an incentive of
patriotism to the living by keeping be
fore them the sentiment so well ex
pressed by the Roman poet: 'Dulce et
decorum est pro patria morl' ("It is
sweet and glorious to die for one's
country'). 1 "
PHILADELPHIA IS
NOW PROTECTED.
Bushing Work on the Warships Now
TTrider Repairs at the League
Island Navy-Yard.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 28. â The
work of preparing the Mlantonomoh
and Katahdin for sea is progressing
with extreme rapidity at League Isl
and. All day to-day a large farce of
men calked the monitor's deck, while
laborers climbed over them in filling
the bunkers with coal.
The Katahdin and Minneapolis are ;
also being coaled. At high tide, 7
o'clock to-morrow morning, the Colum
bia will move an>und from the back
channel and nlip into the drydock,
which has been filled with water for
I that purpose. The seriousness of the
! situation may be realized from the fact
! that visitors "heretofore welcome aboard
I the ships, are now rigidly excluded, so
| as to give the hands a better chance
! to- work. A guard of marines has been
J thrown about the Miantonomoh and no
one was permitted to approach within
! seeing distance to-day.
Only six of one hundred men who
presented themselves for enlistment on
' board the receiving ship Richmond to
day were accepted. Orders have been
received to ship a number to make up
the Miantonomoh's complement.
Two cars loaded with high explosives
i arrived at Delaware City, forty miles
; down the river, to-day. They were con-
I signed from the New York arsenal to
Fort Delaware on Pea Island and Fort
Mathew at Finns Point. These ft.-rts
i command the approach to Philadelphia.
INVESTIGATORS WILL
RETURN TO HAVANA.
This Tends to Show That the Naval
Court Has Not Accepted
the Accident Theory.
WASHINGT' >N. Feb. 28.â At the
close of office hours a telegram canr 3 I
to the Navy Department from Admiral J
Sicard at Key West in the following
terms:

retary of the Na\y. V.'ashington: Court

after further work upon the wreck.
SICARD.
The important feature of this com
munication is the declaration that the
court will return to Havana. It sets j
at rest the rumors that have been cur
rent for days past that the court was
not to return to Havana. One impor- j
tant deduction to be drawn from the
message was that the report of the
Court of Inquiry can scarcely be ex
pected for several weeks t<> come. The j
court will be occupied at Key West j
for some days at least in taking the
testimony of the survivors there. Then I
upon the return to Havana it is ex- j
pected that a good deal of time must j
elapse before the divers can get !
through the mud which now encom
passes the lower part of the wreck of
the Maine, and examine the bottom.

T )NDON, Feb. 28.â Rev. Dr. Charles

United States in October last, as chair
man of the Congregational Union of
England, in an effort, it is said, to in
duce the United States Senate to con
firm the arbitration treaty and also to
advocate church union, replying to an
influential American, writes:
"My view, and I think it is gen
erally held by rational Englishmen, is
that the trouble in Tuba has gone on
long enough. It is b*>ing fomented by
men who flout the authority of Spain,
while protesting against American in
terference. This state of things is kept
up for the sake of a number of rot
ten interests. Spain is not so much
contumacious as powerless, and the
United States Government is the only
power who can restore order, and with
due regard to its own Monroe doctrine
and collateral obligations, the Wash
ington executive is Justified in insist
ing upon order, even if it becomes ne
cessary to superintend the manage

Parley's New Explosive.
CHICAGO, Feb. 28.â William S. Dar
ley of Chicago, inventor of mirex, one
of the most powerful explosives known
to naval warfare, has been invited to
visit Washington and demonstrate tho
powers of the product to Secretary Long
and his associates. Fifty pounds of
mirex is said to be as effective as five
times that amount of guncotton. Mr.
Darley first attracted the attention of
the naval experts two months ago by
his experiments in Chicago harbor. The
new explosive only serves the purpose
of its inventor when it is thrown into
the water. On land it is harmless and
cannot be exploded.
Rushing Work on Cruisers.
NEW YORK, Feb. 28.â 1t was said at

their arrival at this time. Work is
being rapidly pushed forward m the

CUBANS AND
HAWAIIAN'S
One Race Cannot Be
Taken In Without
the Other.
Present Crisis Promises to Kill
the Pacific Ibiand Annex
ation Scheme.
There Is Also a Question as to
Whether the Cubans Would
Come Under Our Flag.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington. Feb. 28.
The Cuban problem will kill the Ha
waiian annexation scheme. Hawaiian
annexation has been forgotten in the
overwhelming interest attaching to the
Cuban crisis. But while Cuba has thus
for the time being displaced Hawaii ja
! popular thought and in Congressional
discussion, the two subjects are very
closely related and to an extent inter
dependent. If Hawaii is to be annexed
I it is hard to see h"W Cuba likewise can
j long be denied admittance to the Union.
', Cuba seems lost to Spain, in fact, and
i as soon as the actual severance, how
ever brought about, becomes recognized
in treaty and in law, the question of
American annexation is bound to come
jto the front. Some element in Cuba, it
1 may be counted on, will desire attach
; ment with this country, and if such an
'â  element can once get into contml its
â  .status would be similar to that of the
j Hawaiian Government under President
Dole, now seeking annexation.
This close resemblance between the
Hawaiian situation to-day and what
seems destined to be the Cuban situa
tion at no very distant day is having
an obvious effect upon the pending an
! nexation controversy. "When a Con
! pressman is now asked if he believes In
1 annexation he will be dull, indeed, if
both annexations are not suggested to
his mind. The prospect of Cuban an
' nexation raises the interesting question
; of what might happen in case the in
surgent forces on the island, after com
; ing under the authority of the United
! States Government, should decide that
! they did not like it and rise in rebel
j lion.
There is no evidence that the fight
â  ing bands in the interior of Cuba love
' the Gove* nment at Washington for its
i own sake, but rather as a weapon
j against their present foes. It might
! happen that they would object to be
i coming a part of the United States, and
i still if a minority who chanced to be In
i power wanted annexation agreeable to
| the Hawaiian precedent, we should
! have to annex the island. It would bo
i possible that a clique of cigar-makers
â  and sugar-planters in Havana and the
â¢ other sea ports might bring about an
! nexation against the wishes of the very
! forces that are now fighting the Span
i ish.
This is one of the possibilities of the
! troubles that might afflict us in event
of annexation. It is not out of the
question that the native races of Ha
waii may at some time rise in rebel
lion, and nothing but the strongest mil
j itary authority of the United States
' Government would be sufficient to keep
them in subjection. It cannot be said
that none of the peoples we have an
' nexed in the past have not desired to
get away from us .again â the Texans,
! for instance. In the present eompll
, cated situation it is impossible to tell
i how the House would now vote on the
question of Hawaiian annexation. As
suming that the Speaker allowed the
issue to- come before the House, many
conservative Representatives are very
uncertain, and there is no telling what
influence may become operative when
the subject actually reaches the front.
i It would not be a difficult task to de
feat it, and many Congressmen seem
greatly influenced against any kind of
annexation because of the Cuban diffi
culties. ______^_____
LODGE OF SORROW
FOR MASONIC VICTIMS.
CITY OF MEXICO, Feb. 28.â The
Mexican, German and Spanish lodges
of this city have spontaneously invited
their American brethren to a special
lodge of sorrow to be held on the 3d
of March in memory of the Masons
who perished in the Maine disaster, and
as a mark of sympathy of the losses
sustained by the order and the United
States. It is a noteworthy fact that
the initiative was taken in this matter
by Grand Orator Carlos Roumagnie,
a native born Spaniard, of Madrid, who
supplemented the movement in a
speech full of feeling. There ie no ill
feeling between Amercans and the bet
ter class of Spaniards here.
TALK OF PEACE
BUT CONTINUE TO
PREPARE FOR WAR
That Is the Present Stand of
the President and His
Advisers,
Demands to Be Made Upon Spain for In
demnity to Depend Upon the Report
of the Court of Inquiry.
NEW YORK, Feb. 28.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
President McKinley and his advisers
are still taking steps to put the coun
try in as thorough a condition of de
fense as the resources put at their
command by Congress will admit; but
they are talking more hopefully of a
diplomatic settlement of the Maine af
fair than at any time since the Her
ald's dispatches convinced them that
the vessel had been destroyed by some
outside agency.
This does not imply that there is any
disposition on the part of the admin
istration to lessen in any way its de
mands upon Spain if the report of the
court of inquiry should fix any re
sponsibility upon that Government. It
is rather due to the growing belief that
Spain will comply with such demands
rather than resist them to the point of
forcing the two nations into war. In
timations have been received here that
the Sagasta Ministry Is willing to go
further in the direction of preserving
peace than had been generally ex
pected, and should the report of the
court of inquiry justify the conclusion
that the ship was destroyed by any
thing short of military appliance in the
control of the Spanish Government
there is reason to believe that there
will be little difficulty in arriving at
a diplomatic settlement. Should the
report, on the other hand, show beyond
a reasonable doubt that the %-essel was
destroyed by such an appliance a set
tlement will be more difficult. In the
latter case the administration would
demand a larger indemnity, a disa
vowal and the punishment of the guilty
person or persons.
Spain would be sure to resist such a
demand and dispute the conclusions of
the court. With such a question pend
ing and the people of both countries in
flamed against each other, a diplomatic
settlement might be very difficult. Both
the President and Secretary Long in
conversation with Senators and Repre
sentatives to-day assured them that
they were more hopeful of a peaceful
solution. Secretary Long told me to
day that the situation appeared to be
more favorable. Assistant Secretary
Roosevelt also declared that the de
partment had n<> reason to anticipate
trouble, but it had no intention to be
unprepared in the event it should come.
I understand the President and Secre
tary Long have received a letter writ
ten to an officer on duty in the Navy
Department by a naval officer In Ha
vana in which the writer speaks of the
difficulty of definitely determining the
cause of the catastrophe, and states that
on account of the muddy condition of
the water divers have to depend for the
information they get about the condi
tion of the hulk not on their sense of
sight but on their sense of touch. This
officer is most anxious that the Maine
should be raised as soon as possible.
He says she is sinking deeper in the
mud and the longer she remains the
more difficult it will be to save her.
The court of inquiry is evidently anx
ious to learn about the appearance of
the wreck. The department was in
formed by telegraph that the court of
inquiry would commence a session at
Key West to-day. They must resume
at Havana to obtain evidence of divers
after further work upon the wreck.
It is expected by the department that
the court will have to remain at Key
West until the latter part of the week
and will then return to Havana to
hear testimony to be given by divers.
The divers of the Right Arm. the
wrecking vessel, are at work and they
will be joined by a force which has Just
left New York on board the Under
writer. The progress made by the
court up to February 25 Is told in this
letter from Captain W. T. Sampson,
president of the court, dated Havana,
which was given out for publication by
Secretary Long to-day:
February 23. 189&
Sir: The oourt has taken the testimony
of all the officers of the Maine still here.
To-morrow we will take such testimony
as the divers have accumulated. The
Right Arm arrived here this morning
and reported to Captain Sigsbee, accord
ing to orders. I trust some wrecking com
pany will be given the entire job, as no
other plan will be feasible. There are
two citizens in the harbor who have sig
nified their willingness to testify, al
though they have nothing important.
After taking this evidence and that of
the divers I propose to return to Key
West and take the evidence of the officers
and men there. It may be necessary to
return here after further progress has
been made by the divers. Very respect
fully, W. T. SAMPSON.
Captain United S*ates Navy.
Evidence of much importance in en
abling the court in understanding the
details of the structure of the Maine
will be obtained from Naval Construc
tor Hoover and Carpenter Helm, who
were associates of Naval Constructor
Fernal in building the late battle
ship.
The court telegraphed to Secretary
Long, asking that the officers who su
perintended the construction of the ship
be directed to appear before it. The
orders were at once sent to Hoover and
Helm in accordance with the court's re
quest, directing them to mnneed to
Key West and there give such testl*
mony as might be desired. It is pre
sumed at the department that the court
desires to ascertain the structural ar
rangement of the interior of the ship
and the bearing it has on the cause of
the explosion.
LIKE THE DAYS OF
FIRING ON SUMTER.
Renewed Activity at the Arsenal
and Gun Factory at
Watervliet.
ALBANY. X. V., Feb. 28.â The activ
ity at the Watervliet arsenal and gun
foundry continued to-day. Since the
Maine disaster there has been a hush
of anxious suspense about the place.
Old residents in that vicinity, who re
member the rush orders that were
given when Fort Sumter was fired
upon, state that the conditions there
are now the same as at that time.
Officers will not say anything. It
was learned at the gun factory to-day
] that twelve mortars have been boxed
: and are ready for shipment as soon
' as cars arrive to con\ey them to their
destination. Sandy Hook. It is under
: stood that part of the shipment will be
made to-morrow morning.
Twenty machinists, whose names ap
pear on the eligible civil service list,
â  were notified Saturday by the secre
tary of the local civil service board to
report at the gunshop to-morrow
ready to go to work. It is the inten
tion of the authorities to put the men
! at work on parts of rifles which are
in a fair way of completion.
The master mechanic. Alfred ChrlÃ
; tiansen. an expert on the building of
â  rifles of large caliber, and who has
the manufacture of rifles
j at the arsenal for the past eight years,
will leave to-morrow, ostensibly for
Washington, at the orders nf the War
Department, but in reality for the fnrts
and coast defenses where the guns
i which have been sent from Watervliet
are located. He will make a thorough
; examination of the condition of the
i huge pieces of ordnance.

}taten Islanders Grow Most En

Make Presents to the
Bluejackets.
NEW YORK, Feb. 2*.â With gloam
ing white sides and burnished trims fore
and aft, the United States monitor Ter
ror lay at anchor to-day "ft" Tompkins
ville, within a cable-length of the spot
where the blaek-sid.d Spanish cruiser
Vizcaya was anchored last week.
Staten Islanders greeted the guardian
of the port of New York with cheers,
and so many small boats put out to the
monitor that one of her officers said
that Now Yorkers seemed to have be
come hysterical.
Ice covered the bows nnd forward
deck of the monitor this morning, and
it was plain that during her trip from
Hampton Roads waves had dashed
over her decks almost without hin
drance, owing to the low freeboard of
the vessel. The warm sun enabled the
crew to get rid of the ice early in the
day. however, and when The Call eor
ivspondent stepped aboard in the after
noon the monitor was spick and span.
Captain Nicoll Ludlow told me that
the run from Hampton Roads was a
most pleasant one. Fair weather and a
smooth sea had been experienced from
Saturday afternoon, when the monitor
got under way, until early this morn
ing, when she arrived. The captain
said his orders were to come to New
York and anchor off Tompkinsville, and
that he had no idea as to how long he
is to remain. He said he would not go
to the Brooklyn navy-yard or any other
place, but would remain off Tompkins
ville until other orders were received.
I asked the captain if he had come
prepared to protect the city of New
York and if the monitor had any un
usual supply of ammunition aboard.
The captain smiled grimly, and said:
"I have some."
Captain Ludlow is a great believer in
the efficiency of the monitor type of the
navy vesel. He served on one in the
Civil War, and has been an earnest ad
vocate of increasing the number of
monitors ever since. He told me that
he hoped to see Congress make an ap
propriation for fifteen additional ves
sels of the type of the one he com
mands. None of the sailors of the Ter
ror were given shore leave to-day. A
boat was sent off for mail, and the pay
master went to the navy-yard. An or
derly and a couple of bluejackets were
halted on their way from their boat to
the postoffice at Tompkinsville by a
crowd of enthusiastic islanders who
shook hands with the tars, presented
tobacco to them and cheered enthusias
tically.
The Terror at 1 o'clock moved from
her anchorage below Tompkinsville to
a point about half a mile north, oppo
site the lighthouse station. Passengers
on the Staten Island ferry boat crowded
the rail to have a look at the craft sent
to guard the city.
HOLLAND'S SUBMARINE
BOAT READY FOR SEA.
Naval Officers Try in Vain to Get
Aboard of the Rather Mys
terious Craft.
NEW YORK, Feb. 28.â M.-n were en
gaged all to-day aboard the Holland
submarine boat at Perth Amboy, N. J.,
making preparations for the final trips
of that craft. The boat was constantly
surrounded by a crowd of spectators.
Mr. Holland was anxious to try the
boat to-day, but there was a little
trouble with the steeringapparatus, and
when it was remedied it was too late
for the trip. The Holland lies in a
deep basin surrounded by barges Her
engines are constantly at work, but the
only indication of movement is a few
bubbles which arise to the surface. By
the end of the week the Holland will
be ready for service, and early next
week the boat will be put in shape for
its long run to Washington.
The "exclusive information given by
The Call and Herald regarding this
boat caused several naval officers to
visit Perth Amboy, but Mr. Holland
firmly refused to allow them to see the
workings of the boat.

DEMANDING BETTER

National Guardsmen of Massachu-

BOSTON, Ftb. 2S.âAdjutant-Gen
eral Dalton and Brigadier-General
Guild have been detailed by Governor
Wolcott to go to Washington to see the
Massachusetts delegation in further
ance of a bill now before Congress in
creasing the appropriations for the
equipment of the militia of the several
States of the Union. These officers
went to Washington late this evening
and will remain in the capital as long
as their services may be productive of
good.
Generals Dalton and Guild are to go
before the War Department and state
the present condition of the armament
of the field artillery of the militia of
this State, with a view to procuring, if
possible, more modern guns. The regu
lar army of the United States is at
present supplied as to its field artillery
with the :â¢; and 2 inch breechloading
rifles. The guns used by our National
Guard are the obsolete muzzle-loaders
of the Civil War period, and at least
one <>f the batteries is almost useless
on account of the difficulty experienced
in obtaining ammunition that is no
longer manufactured in the Govern
ment arsenals. Repeated appeals have
been made to the Secretary of War of
late by the artillery officers for better
guns. The Governor believes in "strik
ing when the iron is hot."

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 1, 1898.
WAR SPIRIT
OF MILITIA
Leaders of the Guardsmen
Hold an Important
Council.
Officers and Enlisted Men
Would Gladly Volunteer
for Service.
In the Event of War Ten Million Loyal
Citizens Would Shoulder
Muskets.
Major-General J. H. Dickinson, divi
sion commander of the National Guard
of California, Adjutant-General A. W.
Barrett and Brigadier-General R. H.
Warfleld, Second Brigade, held a coun
cil of war yesterday and discussed the
military situation. The sentiment of
patriotism is very active in the guard,
and should war be declared many of
the members would ask for immediate
duty at the front.
General Warfield was asked last
evening what proportion of the Na
tional Guard would volunteer for en
listment in the TJnited States service
in the event of w;ir with Spain. He
replied that he could not give an esti
mate. When asked if 50 per cent would
enlist to go out of the State and serve
In any Held selected by the Govern
ment, he replied: "I have yet to find
the first officer or enlisted man who
would not willingly go to the front
should we have war with Spain."
General Warfield seems to entertain
the idea that the troops of the National
Guard would be called for at once by
General Miles to serve for a period of
ninety days while the volunteer regi
ments were being organized. It is his
opinion that the occupation of Cuba
would be immediate, and that the or
ganized State troops would join the ex
pedition to the island.
Various opinions exist as to what the
status of the National Guard would be
in the event of hostilities with Spain.
Officers of the United States army gen
erally incline to the opinion that vol
unteer regiments would be organized
independently of the National Guard
and sworn into the service of the
United States. The Government- in
former times had so much trouble in
dealing with State troops that unquali
fied obedience to the United States is
now demanded by the terms of enlist
ment.
In a digest by the Judge Advocate
General of the United States this view
is taken: "In the exercise of its con
stitutional power 'to provide for calling
l".,rth the militia' and 'to provide for
organizing' the same, etc., Congress
has made no distinction between any
different portions of the force or recog
nized any such portions as 'National
Guard,' The Unjted States statutes
take no notice of 'National Guard" as
such. If called out it is not as 'Na
tional Guard," but as militia; and when
so called forth or included in a call it
must be governed by the existing laws
for the organization, discipline, etc., of
the militia. The act of February 28,
1595, authorizing the President to call
out the militia, is constitutional, and
the President is the final judge of the
emergency justifying such call."
The President can call on a State
Governor for troops. Should the Gov
ernor fail to obey the order the Pres
ident can call on the commander of the
State troops next lower in rank and so
on (k)wn the line until he can get the
troops in the field. An officer failing to
obey the President may be tried and
punished by court-martial.
There is no doubt that California
would supply her quota of troops im
mediately under a call from the Presi
dent, but it is a question whether the
National Guard regiments would go as
organizations or new volunteer regi
ments be raised.
Colonel Fairbanks, for example, com
mands a National Guard regiment
which is the equal of any troops of this
class In the United States, but his
regiment, the Fifth Infantry, N. G. C,
if accepted, would be sworn into the
service of the United States, and this
would involve the enlistment of each
member of the regiment. Col. James
F. Smith's First Infantry is another
excellent regiment, but if its service
was accepted the men would bo obliged
to enlist in the United States volunteer
army and be subject to the orders of
the Government. National Guards
men, having had military instruction,
might obtain preference in enlistment.
The militia as recognized by the Gov
ernment consists of every able-bodied
male citizen between the ages of 18 and
45 years. Uncle Sam has therefore
about ten millions of men able for mili
tary duty. It is not a wild estimate to
say that the President could get one
million men to voluntarily enlist. After
six months of camp instruction, active
drill and constant care and discipline
by fairly capable officers an effective
and disciplined force of six hundred
thousand men could be evolved.
"THERE WILL BE NO WAR,"
SAYS REV. DR. TALMAGE.
Would Not Give a Hundred Lives of
Americans for Cuba, Spain
and Hawaii.
BOSTON, Feb. 2S.â Rev. T. DeWitt
Talmage of Washington, D. C, lectured
at the star course at Tremont Temple
to-night. Dr. Talmage began by re
ferring to the thought uppermost in
the popular mind, the posibility of war
with" Spain. He said bluntly: "There
will be no war between the United
States and Spain. I would not give a
hundred lives of Americans for the
whole possession of Cuba, Hawaii and
Spain. We are to have peace on earth
and goodwill to men." There was great
applause.
Govin's Alleged Perfidy.
MADRID, Feb. 2S.â The Nacional re

Cuba in the Colonial Government, pub
lished in the Filibuster Journal, Patria,
and containing alleged instructions
given by Senor Govin to Acosta, who
is said to be his emissary to negotiate
with the Cuban Junta in the United
States in regard to the terms which the
Cubans should exact from Spain.
The unofficial papers comment
strongly upon this so-called perfidy of
Senor Govin, and say he is bound to

THE COAST DEFENSE 16-INCH 126-TON BREECHLOADING STEEL RIFLE.
This Gun, Designed by the Army Bureau of Ordnance, Is the Most Powerful Gun in the World. Its Projectile Weighs 2300
Pounds, Its Powder Charge Is Over 1000 Pounds, and Its Extreme Range Will Be Nearly Fifteen Miles, Thus Ex
ceeding by Three Miles the Range of the Jubilee Shot, Fired Ten Years Ago in England.
REGULAR ARMY
MEN AND THEIR
PLANS FOR WAR
While the Big Guns for Defense
Are Being Placed in Position
the Troops Are xMustered
and Inspected.
It is readily recognized by the army
that the Government is making prep
arations for war. These preparations
may be the surest guarantee of peace,
but the fact is na longer questioned
that the vigilance and activity at all
the garrisons signify a purpose on the
part of the War Department to be
ready for battle.
Yesterday all the troops In the De
partment of California were mustered
for the regular monthly inspection.
The troops of the Third Artillery,
Fourth Cavalry and First Infantry,
stationed at the Presidio, turned out
fii fine order. Owing to the moist con
dition of the ground early in the morn
ing there was no review, but every
thing pertaining to the different com
mands proved to be in good order.
The first of the two 10-inch rifles
mentioned in The Call as having re
cently arrived from the East reached
Fort Point emplacement Sunday even
ing. The contractor encountered many
obstacles in hauling the gun from the
freight yards of the Southern Pacific
to the Lombard street gate of the Pre
sidio reservation. After reaching the
reserve few difficulties were in thi
way. Ihe haul up the hill on the way
from thf garrison proper to the works
did not cause much delay. The second
gun, which also weighs thirty-four
tons, will be delivered at Fort Point in
due time.
Troops have been detailed from the
Third Artillery to mount these guns
and hasten the work on the new mor
tar battery. It was the old custom in
the army for the Ordnance Corps to
hire civilian labor to mount guns, but
of recent years the regular troops have
been called on to perform this duty.
The works are planned and construct
ed under the direction of the Engineer
Corps, and when completed are turned
over to the Ordnance Corps. When the
carriages arc put in and the guns
mounted and tested the Ordnance Corps
transfers everything to the command
er of the post.
There are many citizens of San Fran
cisco, well informed on general sub
jects, who insist that the land defenses
of this harbor consist of a few un
mounted guns and that the big mod
ern rifles are not in position for imme
diate use. The Call not long since pub
lished an article showing the number
of modern guns mounted and ready
fur instant use in each of the principal
works of the harbor. The statement as
to the number of twelve-inch guns at
Fort Point has been disputed. The fact
can be proved that five twelve-inch and
three ten-Inch modern rifles are in po
sition at Fort Point and ready for use
at any hour. These guns constitute a
formidable battery, as advanced mod
ern batteries are estimated. No battle
ship or cruiser could shell San Fran
cisco without coming within the range
of these powerful rifles.
Sixty skilled men were sent to the
Presidio yesterday morning for duty in
mounting guns at Fort Point. The de
tails were made from batteries sta
tioned at Angel Island, Lime Point and
Fort Mason. The detachments arriv
ing at the Presidio reported to Colonel
Miles, commanding the post.
Colonel Miles was a busy man yes
terday. The early muster engaged his
attention in the forenoon. He spoke
highly of the condition of the troops at
the garrison. Speaking generally of af
fairs at the Presidio he remarked:
"There is no change. The men detailed
to mount the guns have been assigned
to that duty. Yes, the usual vigilance
is observed to prevent unauthorized
persons from inspecting the works or
tampering with the guns or carriages.
Mounted men patrol the reservation,
but they have not arrested any sus
picious characters. It requires some
vigilance to keep boys from trapping
the quail on the reservation. The pa
trols came across six or eight traps and
some had quail in them. We ascer
tained that the boys were catching the
live birds for some one in the city. The
sentinel was placed on the board walk
for the protection of ladies who might
be passing along after dark."
The subject of ammunition is one
that army officers decline to discuss. It
is believed that the supply of ammuni
tion for the high-power guns is lim
ited. Yesterday it was reported that
the Santa Cruz Powder Company had.
after consultatio-n with the Ordnance
Department, decided to extend the
works at that place and put in a plant
for the special manufacture of powder
for the army on this coast. Frequent
tests of Santa Cruz powder have been
made under the direction of Lieutenant
Babbitt during the past year. Kecent
tests demonstrated the ability of the
Santa Cruz people to- meet the require
ments of the Government, hence the
proposed enlargement of the plant to
suppiy the forthcoming demand. The
Government requires that the powder
for the twelve-inch rifles, the standard
charge being fcrur hundred and fifty
pounds, shall give the one thousand
pound steel projectile an initial velocity
of two thousand feet per second, with
out exerting an undue pressure on the
gtin. The pressure can be accurately
measured in an oil cylinder, which reg
isters the recoil <rf the gun. Many tests
were made before all the conditions de
manded were fulfilled. It is said now
that a powder has been produced which
will give the desired velocity to the pro
jectile without exerting too much pres
sure on the gun. The results attained
are regarded in army circles as highly
important. Hereafter it may not be
necessary for the Pacific Coast defenses
to rely on Eastern manufacturers for
supplies of effective powder. The chief
of ordnance in Washington has been
advised of all the experiments made in
San Francisco. In fact, authority for
the tests came from the chief of the
corps.
Yesterday Lieutenant William S. Mc-
Nair, Third Artillery, reported to the
commanding officer at the Presidio for
duty in connection with the mounting
of modern guns.
General Shatter, commanding the De
partment, is at Bakersfield. Lieuten
ant John D. Miley, Fifth Artillery, aid
on the staff of General Shafter, left the
city for the south last Sunday.
Yesterday Major Robert H. White,
surgeon and president of the board ap
pointed to conduct the examination of
candidates for West Point, received a i
telegram from Washington directing
that the examination be deferred. Can
didates were also advised of the post
ponement, hence the board did not
meet at the Presidio. It is thought
that matters of more pressing import
ance than West Point cadetships are
now engaging the attention of the
army authorities at headquarters at [
Washington.
The following army officers called at
military headquarters in this city dur
ing the past week: Second Lieutenant
A. E. Saxton, Eighth Infantry, sta
tioned at Fort Meade, South Dakota;
First Lieutenant C. E. Dentler, Elev
enth Infantry, on duty at the State
Agricultural College of Oregon, Cor
vallis. Or.; Second Lieutenant J. J.
Bradley, Fourteenth Infantry, sta
tioned at Vancouver Barracks, Wash.,
who will appear before a board of of
ficers at the Presidio for examination
as to his fitness for promotion.
First Lieutenant James Franklin
Bell, Seventh Cavalry, stationed at
Fort Apache, Ariz., and who is well
known in this city, having been on
duty in San Francisco for several
years as aid to General James Forsyth,
has been detailed as acting judge ad
vocate, Department of the Columbia,
with station at Vancouver Barracks,
Wash. The detail carries with it the
pay of captain. Lieutenant Bell en
tered West Point in September. ISTi,
and was graduated in June, 1878, but
on account of the change of the law
in the promotion of army officers he
has not received his captaincy, al
though several cavalry officers who
were graduated from the United States
Military Academy four years after
Lieutenant Bell have already been
promoted to captains.
Private Hiram A. Harris, Company
B, First Infantry, now at Benicia Bar
racks, has, upon his own application,
been transferred to Light Battery F,
Third Artillery, at the Presidio.
By direction of the Acting Secretary
of War the following enlisted men have
been ordered discharged from the serv
ice of the United States: Private Isaac
T. Chambers, Hospital Corps, Angel
Island: Private William K. Withlow,
Battery L. Third Artillery, Angel Isl
and; Sergeant Charles Leidenberger,
detachment of ordnance, Benicia Ar
senal; Hospital Steward Christian
Schmidt, Presidio.
General Miles Coming West.
CHICAGO, Feb. 28.â A special to the
Tribune says: General Nelson A.
Miles of the United States Army, ac
companied by Rear Admiral Phelps of
the Pacific Coast squadron, U. S. N.,
passed through Pittsbure last night en
route to San Francisco from Washing
ton. It is reported that both are on
their way to San Francisco to look into
the preparations being made to defend
that port in case of war.
SHARPSHOOTERS
ORGANIZE TO
FIGHT SPAIN
Philo Jacoby Now Forming a Big
Company of Famous Marks
men Who Would Willingly
Battle for the Country.
Should the threatened war with I
Spain resolve itself into a stern reality ,
San Francisco will have among; its de- â 
fenders one of the most unique and
powerful organizations that the world
has ever known. It will number among
its members dozens of champion rifle
shots, men who have won world-wide
reputations before the targets, as well
as in actual warfare. Though the
company of warriors will not number
over 200, it is probable that no regiment
in the world could stand before its
fire for more than a very few moments.
Philo Jacoby, the veteran rifle shot, j
who is known throughout the length â 
and breadth of the land as one of the
greatest marksmen the world ever
produced, has been secretly organizing
the company since the complications
with Spain began to take on a belliger- j
ent tone. Jacoby chose his recruits j
from among the men whom he knew
were dead shots at anything inside of
500 yards.
His long experience before the range i
and his acquaintance with the crack
shots of the shooting organizations of
this coast told him whom to see and few
men to whom he spoke regarding the
defense of San Francisco refused to j
join.
Among those who have signed the
roll Jacoby has prepared are Colonel
Beaver of the California Bank; Colonel
H. J. Burns, who served in the Civil
War; A. Strecker, who has won the
proud title of "Shooting King"; Wil
liam Ehrenpfort, one of the veteran
ritle shots of the coast; A. Uahwyler,
the champion of one of the German
shooting oiganiza,'.iox*s; John Utsehig,
who is certain to center a man at any
distance within reach of his rille; L.
O. Babin, Otto Burmeister and a
hundred more.
The idea of the founder of the com
pany is to organize quietly and in such
a manner that the city, the State or the
Federal Government shall not be com
pelled to spend a cent In the arming
and equipping of the organization.
Each man will furnish his own ritle,
ammunition and uniform, and all are
ready to take the field on a day's no
tice. Philo Jacoby explained how he
came to form the organization last
evening.
"Since the trouble with Spain began
to look serious," he said, "1 have been
circulating among my friends finding
out their feelings regarding the mat
ter and recruiting a company, which, if
war is declared, will be the strongest
in the world. Every man in
it has a regular record as a
marksman and the foe who confronts
his rille within 500 yards must certain
ly BO down. Such men as Strecker,
who has made a world's record at the
range; Utschig, Ehrenpfort and Babin,
if formed into a company, would make
formidable opponents to enemies who
outnumbered them five to one. We
are all men of "means, or at least able
to furnish our own arms and equip
ments,* and all we ask is an oppor
tunity to take the field against Spain
or any other foreign enemy. Every
man whom I have selected has signed
an agreement to be ready on twenty
four hours' notice with his rifle and
cartridges, and though we will num
ber but 200 men it will go hard with
any full regiment that dares to op
pose us. We have decided on the name
of California Sharpshooters."
The promoter of the California Sharp
shooters was in his day one of the most
remarkable marksmen known, and dur
ing the Centennial Exposition of 1876
won the championship of the world
from the teams of a dozen countries
for the California Schuetzen Club of
this city. The performance was a
most extraordinary one under the cir
circumstances by which it was made.
Up to the last shot in the competition
; California was beaten and it took a
dead center to win the honors for the
Golden West. Jacoby, as the crack
shot of the team, was the man on
whom the great responsibility rested
Three times he picked up his trusty
rifle and three times he laid it down
because the proper "feel" was not
there. The fourth time, to use Ja-
COby'a own words, "she felt like a bar
of iron." and a dead center Wfcctrlfled
the spectators who were watching
breathlessly for the result.
That shot won for Jacoby a decora
tion that he prizes more than any
other of his earthly possessions. His
club presented him with a beautiful i
laurel wreath in gold and green #â¢
enamel, in the center of which is in
scribed a description of the wonderful
shot.
Jacoby has also a military training
and thousands of German marksmen
would follow his standard In case he
started out to organize a regiment. He
is the editor of the Hebrew.

. young man of 25,
with a strong-
looking frame, was seen the other day
who said he was a very weak man, de-.
spite the fact that he weighed 180 or
more pounds. He said he could not ac-
count for his lack of energy, nor for his
feeling of nervousness and fear of many
things. "I have almost lost my grip," he
said. When a man of that age is in
danger of losing his grip there must be
something wrong somewhere. He ought
to be in the full possession of all his
powers and fit to fulfill with satisfaction
all his duties. But this man confessed
that he could do nothing of the sort. He
sought advice and help time and again,
and he had about concluded that he would
be always weak, when a friend induced
i him to go to 5 Stockton street, in this
! city. He found an eminent physician there
who has seen and cured hundreds of such

I prescribed "Hudyan," which alone is to be

In a week the draining that was going on
in the system was stopped, and confidence
began to be restored. He now sleeps

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 28.â The City
Council to-day took a step which dem- j
onstrates its utter independence of the
City Water Company should that cor
poration fail to comply strictly with Its
contract and turn its plant over to the |
municipality for operation by the city
at the expiration of its contract on the
22d of July next. It also demonstrates
the fact that the City Council is not
going to give the water company one
dollar above the figure fixed by the City
Engineer as the value of its improve
ments to the plant, which figure was
$1,192,000. TMs is one of the direct re
sults of the exposures made by The!

sitions for supplying the city with moun

- to J our com- |
mittee that but three or four of the I
propositions submitted to this commit

â¢ proposition that includes an â 
adeq i â¢ upply of good mountain water
i concerning the right to 3000 min
of. the Piru and Alamos creeks
of Ventura County. The watt r of these
be taken out of the streams
vation of about 3000 feet. The
From the city to the place of
diversion on Piru Creek is about lifty
n miles. The San Fernando Moun
. :â  ssed at an elevation of
feet, which would give the city
.ck at a great pressure suffl
ir Sre purposes. About six miles
the point of diversion on Piru
Creek is . t site for a reservoir
ut 1000 acri-s. About six miles be-]
low ir site is another reser- '
voir site of about 50 acn a. Owing to
mtour of the canyon in the vicinity
of those two reservoir sites the dams for
. â¢ of water at each place would be
ibout 150 feet in length at an eleva- i
of about l- ( > feet. As the bedrock
â¢ or near the surface in each case,
and as good granite for constructing)
dams is within easy reach, the cost of !
these two dams would be comparatively
small, while the storage capacity of the
oirs so formed would be enor
: and fur greater than sufficient for
the needs i ; this city for many years to
Apparently reliable estimates by
Ineers place the cost of
constructing the necessary dams and
building a conduit from the lower reser
voir to Griffith Park sufficient to carry a
tual flow of 2000 inches of water" at
$1,260,000. Jt is also estimated that the
ruction of a reservoir at Griffith j
I'ark, extra siphons, right of way, etc.. I
will cost about $050,000. Allowing" 10 per!
cent extra for Incidentals would make I
the total cost of bringing the water from i
Piru Creek to this city, as above outlined i
about 52.000.000.
Connecting the Piru water supply with '
the existing pipe lines of the city at the j r
estimated value of $1,190,000 would make
the total cost about $3,190,000. These llg- |
urea include the cost of all the water ,
rights, reservoir sites and other lands of 'â¢
the Colorado and California Mineral De- '
veloping Company, .situated on Piru and
Alamos creeks.
The next proposition submitted is that
of the Lake Hornet Water Company.
Although the distance from Lake Hemet
to the city is considerable, the Lake '
Hemet dam is already constructed of solid
granite, and the water supply is very
large. The Lake Hemet dam was planned
160 feet in height, and if completed
to that height tiie reservoir would have
a capacity of about 12.0QD.000,000 gallons.
It is estimated that the cost of piping the
water of Lake Hemet to this city, in
cluding cost of dam. reservoir site, con
duit, right of way, manholes and all other
appurtenances necessary to the proper
maintenance of such system, would be
about $3430,000: length of conduit system, i
Beventy-six miles. The entire cost of such I
system, in addition to the present water
plant of the City Water Company, at the
estimate of $1,190,000, mad.- by the City
Engineer, would be about $4,320,000.
Owing to the short distance from this
city to the ilig Tejunga drainage area, |
your committee has been able to make i
a pretty thorough examination of that
tory. The Kip Tejonga watershed
<'ompri* ; ep an area of about 134 square
miles, varying in elevation from 2000 to
6000 feet above sea level. The water is of
true mountain 1 source. Storage reservoirs j
placed within that watershed would be
during the winter months with
water from melted snow, and during the
remainder of the year from springs or
rain precipitation. Sufficient water is ob
ble to nil all the reservoirs the city
might need. Including the acquisition of
the present water plant at tho Engineer's I
estimate of $1,900,000, the total estimate !
cost of the Hlg Tejunga mountain supply
and the water plant of the City Water
Company should be about $3,236,540.
While U is true that the use of one or
two of the sources herein mentioned j
would involve the u.se of a conduit sys- j
tern for many milea, it is easily shown by
engineering reports that many Other
American cities ii.se water conduits of i
equal or greater length than those herein
mentioned or proposed, and that most of
those cities are compelled to use great
precautions to secure their conduit lines i
from destruction by severe freezing, j
great Hoods and landslides, which are [
common in most parts of the 1 nited
States. - â¢ '
, In this section a good conduit system
once constructed will cost very little for
repairs or maintenance for many years
alter it is built. All these propositions
include the supplying of 'the city with
pure mountain water for all domestic
purposes, the construction of a water
system with sufficient force for fire pur
poses, with adequate power to operate an
electric lighting plant for the entire city,
and with additional power for other pur
poses that may be necessary or desirable.
As to the superiority of pure mountain
water over seepage from flat lands that
are used for pasturage for cattle, there
can be no division of opinion whatever.
Almost every acre of the drainage areas
mentioned in the three foregoing propo
sitions is within the bounds of a Govern
ment reservation, which important fact
guarantees that the water in such basins
is now free from deleterious substances
which are common in the water of all
streams bordered with cities or villages,
or used as a watering place for herds of
domestic animals.
One of the best evidences of the need
of pure water in this city Is the fact that
the people of this city spend large sums
of money for bottled water that is sold
about the streets on a simple recommen
dation for purity alone.
In the matter of fire protection, either
of the propositions herein mentioned
would insure a fall of several hundred
feet within a few miles of the city, which
would give ample protection against de
structive tires. A -saving of less than half
of the amount now annually expended in
this city for fire service (about $Sl.(Â¥>o)
would amount to about 140,000 a year, or
4 per cent on an investment of $1,000,000.
The latter sum would be nearly enough
to pay for the present water plan*, at the
value fixed by the City Engineer.
As soon as the report was read a mo
tion was made to adopt it. Council
man Toll was in favor of having the re
port referred back to the committee
with instructions that it make a spe
cific recommendation in favor of pome
one source of mountain supply. Coun
cilman Xickell placed himself squarely
on record in favor of the adoption of
the report as it came from the commit
tee, without change. The other Coun
cilmen tor k a similar stand. Mr. Nick
ell's unequivocal position gave them
<â â¢ mrage.
Bo the report was adopted without
change. This is the most severe blow
Tli. water company and the syndicated
pressâ the Times. Herald and Express â
have had. It is a victory for the people
and the San Francisco Call.
ST. JOHN TRIES
HIS AUTHORITY
The Deputy Surveyor Imprisons
Dr. Hill on the Steamer
Doric.
As a Result the State and Federal
Quarantine Services Reopen
War.
Deputy Surveyor Chauncey St.
John became extra officious yesterday
and as a consequence the State Board
of Health, Federal quarantine and
customs service are all on the verge of
a beautiful triangular row. It all hap
pened in this way:
When the O. and O. steamer Doric
passed in yesterday she flew the yel
; low flag, as there had been one bad
| case of smallpox on board which had
! resulted fatally, the victim, one of the
, Chinese comprising the crew, dying
! and being buried at sea while the ship
was still two 'lays out from this port.
Tht> first official to board the vessel
after she entered the harbor was Dr.
Edmund E. Hill, Assistant State Quar
antine Officer, who arived on her decks
a few moments ahead of Dr. Rupert
Blue of the Federal quarantine and
Mr. St. John, with six custom house
officers.
Both Dr. Hill and Dr. Blue received
the report of the ship's surgeon, and
I then Dr. Hill decided to go ashore
j and report to his superior. Dr. Chal
: mers, for further orders, while Dr.
I Blue remained aboard, though taking
no .steps to quarantine the vessel, un
til his superior, Dr. Rosenau, should
arrive and look into the matter for
! himself. Dr. Hill bade farewell to the
ship.- officers and started for the
! gangway, to descend to the State
! quarantine tug, when his way was
; barred by a minion of the all-powerful
St. John, who informed him that it
j was the will of that august personage
: that net person, not even the State
quarantine officer, should leave the
i ship. Dr. Hill explained and expostu
] lated, but to no effect, and he was
i obliged to swallow his chagrin and re
{ main, while the adamantine St. John,
not content with turning a deaf ear to
his request to turn him loose, gave or
ders that the lines of the State quaran
| tine tug be cast off and that she be
j not allowed to again make fast to the
j steamer.
Such was the state of affairs when
Dr. Rosenau put in an appearance
The matter was laid before him and he
at once gave Dr. Hill full permission
to go ashore whenever he wished, dis
claiming any indorsement of such an
arbitrary proceeding.
Dr. Hill took advantage of the op
portunity and returned to the city,
where he sought out Dr. J. M. William
son, chairman of the Quarantine Com
j mittee of the State Board of Health,
i to whom he told his troubles. Dr. Wil
j iiamson told him to make out a report
i in writing, which will be laid before
| the Board of Health to-day.
It is the intention of Dr. Williamson
â  to seek legal advice on the matter and
i see if some redress cannot be obtained.
He contends that the question of au
'â  thority in such matters is one between
! the Federal and btate. quarantine serv
: ices, and that Mr. St. John had no right
whatever to mix himself up in it.
A consultation was held on the ship
by all of the physicians in regard to
what action should be taken with the
I passengers, baegage and mail.
As there hud b<--en only one case of
smallpox and that among the Chinese
of the crew, it was thought that, as the
cabin passengers had been entirely sep
arated from the infected portion of the
vessel, a thorough fumigation of their
hand baggage and persons would, to
gether with vaccination, be sufficient
precaution.
The whole lot. fifteen in number, were
accordingly fumigated and vaccinated,
after which they were taken on the
i quarantine tug and landed at the Mall
! dock, whence most of them made their
way to the Palace.
The mails will be fumigated and
landed to-day, hut the unfortunate
steerage passengers and crew, who
i number 224 Chinese and whites, will be
detained at the quarantine station on
Ang-el Island for the next fourteen days
or until all danger of contagion has
passed.

GEORGE DOOMED
BY ASSASSINS
One of the Assailants of
Greece's King Is
Captured.
Is a Member of a Club Which
Has Sworn to Slay the
Monarch.
Says the First Attempt Failed Be
cause of the Fright of His
Accomplices.
Special Dispatch to The Call
ATHENS, Feb. IB.âO ne of the men
who attempted the life of the King of
Greece on Saturday has been arrested.
His name is Karditza and he is a
minor employe in the Mayor's office
here. He refused to give the name of
his accomplice.
Two friends of Karditza have been
arrested on suspicion of being his ac
complices. He has become greatly de
pressed.
King George has received a very af
fecting telegram of congratulation
from Mme. Carnot. The Municipal
Council has decided to erect a memo
rial chapel near the scene of the acci
dent.
Karditza. who is 35 years old, was
formerly a non-commissioned officer in
the army. He belongs to a class of
doubtful repute, locally designed as the
Koutzavantis.
The authorities obtained information
that Karditza was hiding in a house
of ill repute, which they caused to be
surrounded by the police, but in the
meantime Karditza had gone to the
Public Prosecutor's office and sur
rendered himself, declaring his inno
cense. Closely pressed, however, he
confessed to having been one of the
King's assailants. He did not express
any regret, and declared that if the j
gun had not trembled in the hands oi j
his accomplce the King would have
been killed. Karditza refused to give
any further information.
According to the Astay, it has been
decided at a secret meeting of a cer
tain club, held outside the city, to as
sassinate the King because he had ac
cepted the proposition for international
financial ontrol of the revenues in or- {
der to arrange the war loan. This de- j
cision, it further appears, was record
ed on the minutes of the club, a copy
of which was sent to the King, who
paid no attention to the threat. L.ater
Karditza said the plan was to shoot
the King's coachman and the horses i
and then to dispatch the King with j
pistols, which he and his companion ]
were carrying.
King George has identified a photo- j
graph of Karditza as that of one of
his assailants. His Majesty has re
ceived a message of congratulation >
from President McKinley.
TEACHER GAINS A
VICTORY IN COURT.
Awarded Damages for a School
Board's Repudiation of a Four-
Year Contract.
SAN BERNARDINO, Feb. 2*.â The case
of Miss May Newell vs. the City Board of
Education for $1900 damages, alleged to
have been sustained from defendants re
pudiating a four-year teaching contract,
was ended to-day, Judge Oster awarding
$300 damages, the equivalent of one year's
wages, or the time the plaintiff has been
out of employment. The decision states
that it would be illegal to pay in advance
under any circumstances. The case may
be reopened after another year has
elapsed.
CHRISTENSEN LEFT A WILL.
STOCKTON, Feb. 28.â 01 d Peter Chris
tensen. a wealthy bachelor farmer who
died a few weeks ago on his lonely ranch
near Waterloo, this county, left an es
tate valued upward of $100,000. and, so far
as known, no heir of his resides this side
of Denmark. Public Administrator Nor
ton is in charge of the estate as adminis
trator, no will having been found. It
was known the old man had a will pre
pared for him, but it was thought it had
not heen executed.
Now comes the story that he made a
will several years ago and left it with
the late Judge Baldwin. Since the death
of Baldwin the document was mailed to
Chrlstensen. and. after lying in the
Postofllce here for thirty clays, was sent
to the Dead Letter Office, and is now in
Washington. Of course, efforts are be
ing made to get the important document,
which, it is said, will give large bequests
to old friends of. the eccontric miser.
SUDDEN DEATH
OF DAVID JACOB
San Francisco Merchant
Stricken by Heart
Disease.
Passes Away at a Tacoma
Hotel After a Brief
Illness.
Recent Business Reverses Believed
to Have Induced His Fatal
Illness.
Special r>!?r > at<'ii to The Call.
TACOMA. Feb. 28.â David Jacob of
San Francisco died at the Bostwick
Hotel to-day of an attack of heart dis
ease. He became seriously ill two
weeks ago and was thought to be dying
at one time last week. Mrs. Jacob,
who came from San Francisco three
nreeka ago, will start back with hi?
body to-morrow morning. They have
three daughters and one son In San
Francisco, all unmarried.
The deceased was til years old. He
was a merchant at Sar. Pablo for near
ly twenty years, and had lived in San
Francisco since six years ago. He was
born in France, and resided for some
time in Mexico. Six or seven years ago
he supplied money with which his sec
ond cousins, Meyer and Joseph Jacob,
established the Chicago shoe store and
City of Paris dry goods house here. He
remained in San Francisco as buyer.
Last year's business was not brisk, and
in January last Meyer and Joseph Ja
cob sold their interests to him.
Early this month he gave a chattel
mortgage on both stores to Mrs. Boris
of San Francisco, his wife's mother,
thus protecting Mrs. Boris, his wife and
several San Francisco friends for $13,000
alleged to have been put into the busi
nes by them. Mrs. Boris' agent was
given possession and commenced t">
sell off the stock. These proceedings
caused the filing of numerous garnish
ment suits by unprotected creditors,
most of them San Francisco whole
salers, and a fierce war among attor
neys followed. The excitement and
worry made Mr. Jacob ill, and there is
little doubt that his death was hastened
by these troubles.
As matters now stand. Mrs. Boris' at
torney is to continue selling the stocks,
retaining all receipts until the rights
of all litigants are settled.
Meyer Jacob, cousin of David, re
turned to-night from his wedding trip
to Stockton and San Francisco.
SALINAS SUGAR PLANT
IS NEARING COMPLETION
SALINAS, Feb. 28.â The Rlsdon Iron
Works of San Francisco, which has the
contract with the Spreckels Sugar Com
pany for the erection and riveting of all
the structural iron work of the factory
buildings, has practically completed the
steel frame work of the main building
for a distance of 175 feet from the north
end. There are nine roof trusses up and
others ready. The company has twelve
gangs of riveters, or forty-eight men in
all, driving rivets, every connection being
made with hot rivets, the smallest of
which is three-quarters of an inch in di
ameter. Thirty-live crystallizers have
been placed in position on the third floor.
G. S. Field, the superintendent of con
struction, says that there are now over
2000 tons of steel erected and that should
the weather continue favorable the steel
frame work of the factory building will
be completed within sixty days. He has
ninety-three men at work at the present
time and will increase the force next
The Spreckels Sugar Company is said
to be about to engage in an irrigating
enterprise of some magnitude on the
ranch at King City recently purchased of
C. H. King. The contract will soon be let
for the work, which will comprehend the
taking from the Salinas River, by four
twelve-inch centrifugal pumps, water for
irrigating the rich bottom lands of the
ranch. The water will be lifted into the
Salinas Valley Water Company's irrigat
ing ditches, with which the land is
covered. This will be a hig thing for
King City and will demonstrate the feasi
bility of irrigation by means of lifting the
water out upon the land.
Death of a Salinas Pioneer.
SALINAS. Feb. 28.â George Abbott, one
of the earliest settlers of this county,
died yesterday at his residence here, aged
XO years. He was a native of Canada,
moving to California In 1868 and coming
directly to Monterey County, where, with
his wife, he had resided ever since. Mr.
Abbott was very prominent in the Ma
sonic fraternity. He was universally
loved and respected, and his loss will be
felt by the entire community.
THE BOSSES
TO HOLD NO
CONVENTION
San Jose's "Gang" Is
Fighting Under
Cover.
Placing Candidates in the
Field in the Guise of
Independents.
Numerous Petitions Circulated
for Men Not on the Re
form Ticket.
THE NOMINEES ARE MANY.
Have Their Canvasser* Hard at Work
Obtaining Signatures of the
Voters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Feb. 28.â This is the sea
son of petitions in San Jose. Everyone
who has ever had any ambition to serve
the people is apparently taking advant
age of the opportunity presented by
existing conditions. All nominations
for the election which is to be hÂ»-.-d six
weeks from to-day mist be filed with
the City Clerk in the form of petitions.
It requires only the signatures of. 150
properly qualified voters to make such
a petition valid, and there are few with
political aspirations who cannot mus
ter this number of friends.
Canvassers with petitions of various
candidates were encountered to-day in
the business portion of the town. This
peculiar industry promises to continue
with more or less vigor each day until
the date fixed as the limit for filing
such petitions.
Judging from the petitions that have
been already filed and from those in
circulation, it is probable that the'
"gang" will make no formal nomina
tic- by conventions. Its plan is evi
dently to have its men enter the field
as independent candidates, hoping thus
to conceal the connection of â¦ v -- Â»-Â»Â«Â» ii
with the "gang" and thus del"' the
public.
Under these circumstances there will
be ' ' one safe way to vote for all
citizens who wish to further the cause
of good government. The ticket of the
New Charter < 'lub must be voted
straight from top to bottom.
Through the papers which are not
friendly to the -ood government move
ment, for reasons best known to them
selves and the "gang." an imnression
has been sought to be created that all
was not in tune with the charter
Club nor between that organization and
kindred bodies seeking, the overthrow
of the "gang." After a careful inves
tigation it can be positively stated that
all these elements will work and vote
as one for the success of the ticket
that has been named by the New Char
ter Club.
The latest independent petitions "â¢ -â *
are those of J. D. Miner for Council
man-at-large, and H. J. Fikes and
Henry Booksin Sr., for members of the
ofnting board. Petitions are report
ed to be in circulation for the follow
ing independent candidates: William
Moir, Councilman First Ward; William
Ziegler, Councilman Fourth Ward;
William Dougherty. City Clerk: F. E.
Spencer, P. P. Austin, Rush MeComas.
Milton Campbell, A. (*. Bennett. Elmer
E. Chase, Dr. I. N. Frasse, members
appointing board.
None of the candidates of the New
Charter Club has yet filed a petition.
SERIOUS SEQUEL
TO THEIR JOKE
New Year's Eve Revelers Give
a Suisun Man Unpleas
ant Notoriety.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUISUN DEPOT, Feb. 28.â N0 little sur
prise was occasioned here to-day when
the people read in the San Francisco
Chronicle the account of the new de
velopments in the Wilson murder case.
On October 9, 1596. Daniel H. Wilson, a
Suisun Valley orchardist, was murdered
at his doorstep after nightfall. There
were peculiarly suspicious circumstances
in connection with the cowardly murder,
and a few days thereafter three or four
arrests were made, but the suspected
persons were soon released. The officers
were more baffled then than ever, but
they never gave up the case as hopeless.
Sheriff Rush and the other officers have
followed up every possible clew, and have
been confident all along of ultimately
bringing the assassin to justice. They
have pursued their investigations so
quietly and concealed their movements so
carefully that the public regarded the
case as" having been abandoned.
An incident which occurred a few weeks
ago, however, revived interest in the case,
and' led to the publication of an article
which bids fair to ruin the work done
thus far by the officers. On New Year's
eve, while the customury festivities were
being indulged in by a crowd of men and
boys, a practical joke was perpetrated on
one of the bystanders, and resulted in
giving him uncomfortable notoriety. 11.
W. McEwen is the person referred to, and
he is openly accused by the Chronicle of
bÂ«lng connected with the murder of Wil
son.
McEwen's connection with the case was
the result of the employment by him sis
housekeeper of Mrs. Dickenson, mother
in-law of the deceased. Mrs. Dickenson
was supposed to know something of the
murder, and on the night McEwen was in
town seeing the old year out and the
new year in one of the hilarious spirits
jokingly suggested t..at be be lynched for
murdering Wilson. McEwen, who is an
extremely nervous person, made frantic
efforts and succeeded in getting away
from the crowd.
This incident gave rise to considerable
talk of the murder of his neighbor. Al
though it was thought at first that he
might know something of the case, there
was no cause for suspicion being cast
upon him, and the idea that he even
knew anything about the murder has
since been dissipated. Mr. McEwen is
considerably aroused over the publication
and threatens a suit for libel.
VALLEY ROADS GENEROSITY
HANFORD. Feb. 28.â 1n procuring a site
for a cannery and a distillery to Induce
San Francisco capitalists to establish
them in this city, the citizens were helped
out by the Valley road to the extent of
SSOO. This is more than any other firm or
corporation or individual contributed.
Railroad corporation policies have been
of a different kind heretofore, and to see
such practical interest taken in the wel
fare and prosperity of this community is
highly appreciated. Contracts for the
erection of the. buildings have been let,
and two more manufacturing enterprises
axe assured.

PROCTOR OND THE BULL-FIGHT.
SENATOR PROCTOR comes from one of the
most staid and proper of the New England
States. Vermont is not only reckoned a moral
model politically, but upon its escutcheon there is no
s-tain of wooden nutmeg nor ham carved artfully from
the native tree. That a Senator from that State should
conduct himself with propriety must be regarded as
next to inevitable. That he should go about braced
up to sustain an almost visible weight of dignity
would be regarded as natural. Yet Senator Proctor
has been to a bull-fight, and on Sunday at that. What
will the elders in Rutledge, Wcybridge and Middle
bury say?
It is bad enough for a common man to go to a
bull-fight on any day. But here is a Vermont Senator
going to a bull-fight on Sunday. When Proctor shall
ieturn to the green mountains of his beloved State
can he look them in the eye and say "Not guilty?"
It doesn't seem likely. Still, if Proctor went to the
tioubled island not as a smelling committee to sniff
for signs of war. but to see the insides tossed gayly
from a decrepit horse, to cheer the matador, to thrill
at the sight of beauty enjoying itself in gazing at the
arena, perhaps the seriousness of the situation has
been unduly impressed upon us.
TriE BOYCOTT IN CHINATOWN.
OWNERS of property in Chinatown have been
forced to organize an association for the pur
pose of combating a peculiarly vexatious
form of boycotting practiced by the bold highbinders
of that locality, and the publication of their griev
ance? against the offenders adds a new and interesting
chapter to the record of ways that are dark and tricks
that are vain, for which the heathen Chinee is
peculiar.
It appears that whenever a Chinaman is evicted
from a building in Chinatown for non-payment of
rent, or other cause, and not infrequently even when
one leaves a building voluntarily, a flaming red poster
is stuck on the premises giving notice to all Chinamen
that from $50 to Sioo must be forthcoming for the
highbinder societies before a new tenant will be al
lowed to occupy them. The cinch seems to be com
plete. White people do not care to become tenants
in Chinatown. - The property-owner, therefore, must
look to the Chinese for occupants 0/ his buildings,
and. as they are more or less willing subjects of the
highbinders, the boycott stands until the fine is paid
and flaming red poster removed.
It is not going to be easy to devise a remedy for
this state of affairs. So long as the majority of the
Chinese in this country make no effort to relieve
themselves from highbinder domination, it will be
difficult for white men to free them by any laws
he may pass. In this, as in all things else, ''who
would be free, himself must strike the blow"; and
the Chinaman shows no desire to strike in this in
f-tance. As .1 matter of fact, the new tenant who de
murs to enter upon the vacant premises until the
blackmail has been paid may be himself a sharer in
the spoils.
One of the property-owners whose buildings had
been placed under ban proceeded to thrash two
who had moved out and whom he suspected
of having had the boycott established. The results,
according to his statement, were good, for the
boycott was immediately removed. Whether this
remedy would work in all cases may be doubtful, and
under no circumstances could it be generally adopted.
Our laws could never sanction the right of a landlord
to thrash a tenant simply because he moved away
from the landlord's premises and advised other people
not to rent them.
It would be a complete solution for this and a host
of similar evils if the Chinese could be induced to
boycott the United States altogether. San Francisco
would not be injured if the whole race refused to
occupy premises in any part of the city. So long as
they are here we will have to endure their highbinders
and to some extent submit to their exactions. The
property-owners of Chinatown will have public sup
port in any law they can devise for preventing the
blackmail that has been levied upon them, but few
people will have much faith in the success of their
efforts. No statute can transform the Mongolian into
a white man. nor can it rid of Mongolian vices a
country where Mongolians are permitted to live.
People who have been contending that Hawaii
would make a strong outpost in time of war can see
even now how absurd the theory is. The possession
of the islands would simply mean something more
to defend and nothing more to defend it with.
For fear that confusion may arise, it is well to ex
plain that the Corbctt who is fighting for a seat in
the Senate is another fellow.
FREE SILVER FUSION fIND CONFUSION
IN Mr. Townc's silver and fusion speech he says
that we have words in the language, from the
ancients, showing the different things that have
been used for money. Thus pecunia is from pecus, a
herd of cattle, showing that cattle were formerly used
as money and a"standard of value. In the Hebrew
tongue shekel means a lamb, showing that lambs and
sheep were money and a standard of value among the
Hebrews before the name was given to a coin. All
this is true, and, being true, one is astonished that
Mr. Towne does not apply the truth in his argument.
To be consistent he should arraign the ancients for
demonetizing, in turn, cattle and sheep. They were
money once, and a measure of value. But the cow
gave way to the sheep. In that day the sheepbug
overcame the free-coinage-of-cows party, and as cows
were disused as money did prices fall? Was there a
steady advance in the value of sheep and a deprecia
tion of the products of human industry, by reason of
the sheep standard, which the people refused to en
dure? Was there pursuit by hue and cry of the
authors of the cow-demonetizingcrimeof the year X?
Did the ancients finally return to the cow standard or
did they adopt the bi-animal standard, at a ratio of
1 6 lambs to I cow? As a matter of fact they did
neither. They learned the loss in exchange that is in
a fluctuating standard of value. They needed a
standard at all only as they emerged from the age
in which commerce consisted in direct barter of the
articles exchanged. Naturally they chose as a primi
tive medium of exchange the article they had found
in barter to have the most stable value. As they were
near to the nomadic period, cattle had been found
suitable for the purpose. But good years and plenty
of forage inflated the cow currency. Its value fluc
tuated. It was no longer a stable standard. Sheep,
by reason of their fleece which could be worn on the
pelt by men as a garment, or could be drawn into a
thread and woven into fabrics, had uses superior to
cattle, which made their value more stable, and then
the cow was demonetized, because human experience
had found a better medium of exchange. This simple
story of primitive conditions and progress as com
merce grew and the need of a common measure of
value increased is the story of every advance on the
same line, to the present time. Men have gone by
natural selection from one standard of value to an
other. When they reached the use of gold and silver
and pecus and. shekel were translated into coin terms,
the metals were subject to the same laws that had affect
ed the primitive standards which preceded them. The
ancients had witnessed the effect of these natural laws,
but were ignorant of the cause.
Before the Middle Ages were over *.hese laws were
discovered. Mr. Towne has not heard of them yet,
if one is to judge his knowledge by his speech. The
law which governs tht selection and circulation of
money is that when two kinds of money of equal
function and privilege but of unequal intrinsic value
are put in circulation, the one of less value will drive
the other out.
It is for this reason that in every country in the
world where gold and silver have free coinage and
full legal tender function gold is driven out and silver
remains as the depreciated legal standard of value.
Mr. Towne is fighting against this natural law. He
professes to advocate bimetallism, at a ratio of 16 to
i, when the actual ratio is 32 to 1 and fluctuates as
silver goes up and down. If his party prevail, there
will be no bimetallism. We will have silver mono
metallism and the single silver standard as our legal
measure of value. Then will appear the consequences
which followed the greenback issue. Men will exact
in prices enough silver to make the sold value of
what they sell, and the apparent rise in price will be
the actual fall in the purchasing power of legal
money.
In effect, then, Mr. Towne is crying in the political
wilderness for a return to the cow standard of value,
<md his attitude is against every advance in the stan
dard which natural law has caused.
POLICE COURT REPORTERS.
IT is to be hoped that something practical will be
evolved from the investigation of the fees of the
Police Court reporters, now said to have been under
taken by the Grand Jury. For a long time the stenog
raphers in these courts have enjoyed incomes en
tirely disproportionate to their value to the munici
pality. The figures of the last fiscal year show that
one of them received $7000, which is more than is
paid the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court; that
another received $5200, which is more than is paid a
Superior Judge; and that two others drew $4200
and $4900 respectively, showing that a certain uni
formity in fees prevails in all the departments of the
courts.
It is reasonably safe to say that if these four stenog
raphers were put on salaries they would not do one
quarter the business in transcripts they now carry on.
This statement may be explained by the further alle
gation that the chief qualification of a court reporter
who draws his fees from the public treasury consists
in his ability to create business. If Police Judges and
stenographers did not combine to multiply fees the
places of the latter would not be worth one-half what
the returns indicate they yield. In other words, it is
perfectly certain that the princely revenues of the
Police Court reporters are due, rot to the transaction
of legitimate business, but to writing out transcripts
that are never used, or to reporting cases that should
never be reported.
As the law stands there is no remedy for these
abuses. The Supreme Court has decided that when a
statute or the constitution creates a court it impliedly
grants the incumbent the power to provide himself
with the material necessary to exercise his powers.
Accordingly all a Judge need do when he wants a
book or a chair or a sofa or a transcript is to order
the article and send in the bill. The Auditor is for
bidden to question the account and the Treasurer
must pay it on demand. This explains the fees of the
Police Court stenographers. They are their own
auditors.
In one way only may they "be brought up by the
Grand Jury. If they have presented bills for tran
scripts never written out or have Incorrectly com
puted the folios in those actually done, they may be
indicted for a felony. It is doubtful, however, whether
offenses of this kind have been committed. The Police
Court stenographers have no occasion to rob the mu
nicipal treasury. Their incomes are ample for all
legitimate purposes. Doubtless in a Tew years they
will have worked the business up to an even more
remunerative point than at present, since it is ap
parent that each successive year yields more fees.
They are now paid better than the Governor of the
State.
What should be done is to place them on salaries.
The next Legislature ought to pass an act either to
regulate their fees or to abolish them. If something
of this .kind is not done, it cannot be long, in the
natural order of events, before the Police Court
stenographers will incorporate, and, with the Police
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 1, 1898.
Judges, take possesion of the city. This might not
be a bad thing in itself, but innovations are not al
ways pleasant, and this one should be postponed as
long as possible.
THE CRISIS AND THE PRESIDENT.
r\ CCORDING to all reports it will be some time
/ V before the result of the investigations of the
* â¢ Naval Court of Inquiry into the cause of the
destruction of the Maine will be made public. This
delay will be regarded everywhere as an evidence that
the ship was blown up by treachery and not by acci
dent, for it is clear that if the facts now known to the
members of the court tended to confirm the theory'
of an accidental explosion they would be made pub
lic at once, in order to ailay popular excitement and
put an end to all fears of a possible war.
In these days and possibly weeks of suspense, it
is fortunate that the country has a President in whose
stalwart Americanism the people have an unfailing
confidence. It is true that the final issue of peace or
war is not in his hands, but in those of Congress.
Nevertheless, it is well known that to him is intrusted
the conduct of the Government in dealing with the
crisis, and upon his management will depend the
course it will take. A President cannot declare war,
but he can so shape our foreign affairs as to make it
well nigh inevitable, and on the other hand, while he
cannot prevent Congress from declaring war, he can
so direct events as to avert the pretext for it.
On the President, therefore, rather than upon
Congress, the people rely in this emergency. It is
with gratification they note, however, that there is
no shadow of disagreement between the two. Con
gress has thus far made no effort to force the hand of
the Chief Executive. It waits with patience and with
readiness his initiative and his lead. The leaders of
both houses and of all parties will be prompt to re
spond to any call that may be made upon them,
whether it be to arrange for a peaceful solution of the
issue or for war.
The patience and confidence displayed by the
American people during the whole period of thiscrisis
has been one of the best proofs of their assured
strength and determined resolution. There has been
no sign of undue excitement in any part of the nation.
Even in Wall street, where every passing disturbance
of the peace of the world is made the occasion of a
flurry, there has been no notable break in the even
tenor of its way. All classes of people have gone
about their work, neither seeking wa/ nor showing a
desire to evade it.
In his recent address before the Union League
Club at Chicago ex-President Harrison, speaking
with the wisdom derived from his own experience as
Chief Executive of the nation, said:
'"We are not a hysterical people. We can wait, and
we will know our duty when it shall be revealed. We
csn understand that in a time like this there are grave
responsibilities devolving upon the President of the
United States, single responsibilities that he may not
divide with any man. Let us stand about him,
strengthening him in the calm assurance that this
great country desires only what is right, and can wait
until the facts are known before it issues its proclama
tion."
In that sentiment the great mass of the American
people agree and unite. The yellow journals that live
on sensations, and the noisy demagogues who are
forever seeking notoriety by making a clamorous
tumult over every sort of ciisis, may (ash themselves
into a fury during the time, that will intervene before
the issue is settled, but the nation at large will not be
disturbed. President McKinley has prayed his valor
and his patriotism on bloodier battle-fields than are
likely to be caused by any war with Spain, and in his
hands the people trust the responsibility of the time
and await with confidence whatever result may come.
AN IMPRESSIVE CHIEF-
IF Senor Trujillo, Chief of Havana's Secret Police,
has succeeded in doing anything more impressive
than get his picture in the papers the fact has been
kept concealed. The senor wears a tall hat, being
suspected of conversing through the same, and has a
pair of whiskers which to the tropic breezes must be
a source of endless joy.
Immediately after the Maine went down Trujillo
"put his men at work on the case." All Chiefs do
this. They put men at work on any case, and throw
about the whole affair a dignified and impenetrable
air of mystery. So reticent are they as to that which
the men discover as to force the duty of revelation
upon some reporter who has not been enjoined to
silence.
As a matter of fact it makes little difference what
the Havana police may say they have ascertained. If
derogatory to the position of Spain it will never
come to notice, and if tending to put Spain in a fav
orable light will never be accepted by any people but
the Spanish themselves. However, Trujillo's whis
kers are fine, and for the faithful reproduction of
them in the daily prints, the republic, even when torn
by the thought of war, is grateful.
One of the divers in the employ of the Government
ar the Maine wreck has been caught stealing. lie is
said to have robbed the chests of tfte dead seamen.
It would be interesting to know if he is the same
diver who is so freely quoted by certain New York
papers. The person who would steal from a dead
sailor might naturally expect his veracity to be called
in question if he chose to advance theories as to how
the sailor happened to be dead.
When the gold fever seizes upon a person its grip
is considerable, and nothing has been opposed equal
to the task of shaking it off. However, when we
read of a Boston party fitted for the Klondike and
waiting to learn whether their services will be needed
in fighting Spain, we learn with surprise that there
are emotions stronger than the desire for fortune.
Wade Hampton's idea that in the event of diffi
culties the North should do the fighting may be all
right so far as he is personally concerned. But there
is a younger South than General Hampton seems to
know. It would not regard immunity from the privi
lege of enlisting as in the nature of a boon.
A new explosive known as mirex is said to be far
more powerful than gun cotton. If it shall be
proved that the gun cotton on board the Maine sent
that gallant ship to the bottom, the best use for
mirex would seem to be to get the enemy to load
up with it.
Havana Royalists say President McKinley is afraid
to charge the destruction of the Maine to the Spanish.
If they can get any comfort out of this idea they are
welcome to it, and better extract from it all the joy
they can before it shall be suddenly dissfpated.
If Weyler expects his statements to receive any con
sideration he must see that they are accompanied by
affidavits and a generous exhibit of corroborative
evidence.

THE ASEPTIC BARBER SHOP.
They have a barber shop in Baltimore
run on Strictly scientific principles, ac
cording to the Baltimore Sun.
Dr. Bernard Barrow, a young graduate
of the Maryland University, conceived
the plan of the aseptic shop, and his
ideas have been carried out in its estab
lishment under his daily supervision.
Sterilization is the basis of the plan, and
the obje ct Is that none but sterile objects
shall touch the skin of customers of the
barber chairs. Thus are germs killed by
heat, and the shop becomes asepticâ free
from living germs.
When a customer is to be shaved he
reclines in the chair and is enveloped in
a "gown," as the barbers call it. The
barber then washes his hands with soap
and water, and after rinsing them, dips
them in a chemical solution to neutralize
any germs which may be lurking about
his finger tips or nails. Previously he
has trimmed his nails short and has but
toned closely around his wrists the
sleeves of his working jacket.
Sterilized towels come from the dry
heat sterilizer in bunches of ten In a
linen cloth. One of these is pulled out
from the bundle by the aseptic hands of
the barbet and deftly tucked about the
neck of the customer. Lather rubbed up
in a sterilized cup, with a sterilized
brush, is applied, nr.d a sterilized razor
is used to scrape off the growth of beard.
Sterilized brushes and combs are used,
so that nothing comes In contact with the
customer except it has previously been
through the sterilizer. All the implements
have aluminum handles, so that they are.
not affected by heat. They are furnished
in numbers, so that as fast as one thing
is used It is forwarded to the sterilizer.
Back in a corner of the shop are two
copper sterilizers, heated by electricity
and in charge of a young man clad in a
sDotles" and sterilized apron. As the
cups, brushes, razors and combs come
fn>nÂ» use they are put on a marble top
table, from which they go to the steril
izer. Each razor is stropped before it is
sterilized, so that it is then in readiness
for instant use after remaining the speci
fied time within the hot precincts of the
sterilized boiler.
THE AMERICAN FLAG.
Out of the fullness of their reverence
for Old Glory the Loyal Legion of the
United States are taking earnest and
timely action against the desecration of
the nutional ensign.
These soldiers of the legion have felt
their hearts leap within them at the sight
of the beloved bunting going on before
the serried hosts into the very teeth of
hurtling death.
They have sten the glorious oriflamme
flaunting the skies as oatteeies roared
and contending armies thing themselves
against one another in the crash and
shock of conflict.
The flag means too much to men who
have seen it under such circumstances to
have it plastered on dead walls or prt-ssi'd
into service as a soap label. The legion
would have its use as an advertisement
inhibited by statute.
The defenders of the flag are doing the
country a real service in thus emphasiz
ing the duty of deference toward the sym
bol of our national life. Respect and love
for the colors ought to be among the first
sentiments implanted in the hearts of the
youth of the land, and those of mature
years should never fail to teach a simple
but impressive lesson in patriotism by sa
luting the stars and strip--*.
In the summer camp at the national
military academy the flag is displayed on
the color line, and woe to the thoughtless
young militant who neglects to dip his
cap every time he crosses the path â¢ in
which the glorious colors are stacked.

SOME TRICKS OF THE TYPES.
"What is this?" exclaimed a com
positor who was expecting to be pro
moted to a proofreadership shortly.
" 'Sermons in stones, books in the run
ning brooks :* Impossible! He means, of
course, 'Sermons in books and stones in
the running brooks.' " And a new read
ing of Shakespeare appeared next morn
ing.
A sporting compositor thought "Cricket
on the Hearth" must be a slip of the
pen. He made It "Cricket on the
Heath."
A writer on angling had the joy of see-
Ing his sentence, "The young salmon are
beginning to run," printed "The young
salmon are beginning to swim," another
thoughtful compositor having been at
work.
Happier was the transformation of the
sentence, "Bring me my toga" into
"Bring me my togs."
There is a less subtle vein of humor in
the story of the editor who wrote during
an election, "The battle is now opened."
The compositor spelled "battle" with an
"o," and the other side said, of course,
that they had suspected it from the first.
It was by a similar mistake that the
late Baker Pasha, who might fairly be
described as a "battle-scarred vetran."
was called a "battle-scared veteran," the
libel being by no means purged when the
newspaper called the gallant officer a
"bottle-scarred veteran."
Owing to an error in printing the an
nouncement. "A sailor, going to sea. his
wife desires the prayers of the congrega
tion." became "A sailor going to see his
wife deserves the prayers of the con
gregation."
The statement, "Messrs. s pre
serves cannot be beaten," was rather
Vitiated as an advertisement by the
omission of "b" in the last word.
Innocently gay was the newspaper re
port which said that the London ex
press had knocked down a cow and cut
it into "calves."â Gesta Typographic^.
ORDER AND OUTLAWRY.
It is a little humiliating to observe that, ;
while Dawson City, which is on Cana- I
dlan territory, has been notably free from
crime and violence this winter, Dyea and
Skaguay, on our own side of the line, j
have been terrorized by desperadoes. The ;
report of Governor Brady of Alaska |
shows a condition of affairs that calls i
for prompt action by the Federal au- j
thorities unless a reign of terror is to j
exist when the influx of gold seekers be
gins in the spring. The United States
Marshal is powerless and the decrees of j
the courts are laughed at. Troops will
probably be necessary to enforce order,
but it is to be regretted that lawlessness i
has already begun to manifest itself. The j
system of mounted police which has j
proved so effective in the wilder regions j
of Canada and Australia would no doubt \
have operated as satisfactorily on our j
own territory, and the establishment of
such a system is worth the consideration
of the Federal authorities. It would do |
away with the use of troops in main
taining order and would put the police !
power where it belongsâ in the hands of !
the civil authorities. â Chicago Chronicle. 'â ,

SEARCHING FOR KIS PAL.
The 1 atter Is ;<n Ex - Convict arid
Is Well-Knowii to the
Police.
Through the efforts of Detectives Pat
Bullh in Bee and Harper one of the
desperate burglars who have been op
erating in Oakland is behind prison
bars He was arrested last night in a
saloon at Third and Market streets and
locked up In the tanks in the city
Prison. â  :â â â /: :>:â ..:
His name is Jospph King:. According
t- th" police King is one of thÂ»' most
rate burglars in th.- eo-.intry. He
has already served two terms in the
penitentiary for housebreaking. I Mir
ing th.' past few weeks a ntimb'T of
private residences and saloons, in Oak
land have been broken into and valu
able property taken. , : . \
As King his been seen making fre
quent trips to the town across the bay
the police concluded that he had a
hand in the jobs and they determined
to watch him. Despite their efforts the
rate crook plied his vocation with
alarming regularity. Several nights
ago be was seen leaving the house of
one of his victims, accompanied by his
partner in crime.
Fmm the description furnished the
Oakland police of the housebreakers
they became convinced that King was
one of the men. Chief Lees was at
once notified, and hÂ»- detailed Sullivan.
Bee and Harper to arrest him. With
only a meager description of King, Sul
livan start.-d out to find him.
Shortly after 7 o'clock last night he
found him playing poker in a Market
street saloon, and after ordering him
t'. "cash" in the chip?, placed him
under arrest. King offered no resist
ance, and announced his willingness to
tnpany thn detective to police head
quarters. He wore a red sweater, and
With the exeception of short trousers,
was made up as a bicycle rider. After
his name was registered on the "small"
book, he was taken in the tanks and
thoroughly searched. Failing to find
anything of an incriminating nature,
tli.- detective took awaj his clothes
nnd a mpelli i him to don an old suit,
â which was generously supplied by a
City Prison "trusty."
The detectives are hopeful of catch
ing King's partner in crime. They say
he is also an ex-convict, and as he is
well known to the men of the "upper"
office, they are confident of apprehend
ing him.
Captain of Detectives Bohen believes
that King and his confederate are re
sponsible for several burglaries com
mitted in this city. He is convinced
that they nre the men who broke into
:i pawnshop on Montgomery street, a
short time ago, and stole>a miscellane
ous assortment of jewelry.

HARNEY TALKS
OF CREOSOTINC
Says He Has Made a
Careful Study of Tim
ber Preserving.
Has Always Tried to Do His
Duty by the People and
the State.
Devotes Five Hours a Day to His
Office as State Harbor
Commissioner. ;
The trial of the suit brought by th-
Paraffine Paint Company against the
t State Board of Harbor Commissioners
was resumed yesterday before Judge
Belcher. Major P. J. Harney, one of
the members of the commission, whs
on the witness stand all day, and when
adjournment hour arrived his rross
examinatinn had been scarcely begun.
Harney was examined on lines similar
to those involved in the questions
asked him last Thursday, and nothing
new or interesting was brought out.
Harney testified that all the knowl
edge he had concerning the Slade
Lumber contract was hearsay, as he
was not a member of the commission
at the time the contract was let. He
said that he had, since his appoint
ment, been guided in his actions in a
j great measure by the advice of the at
torneys for the board.
"Had you any intention of evading
or disregarding the law while acting
as Harbor Commissioner?" asked At
torney Stratton.
"I had not," replied Harney. "I have
always endeavored to do my duty by
the people and the State."
Harney then said that all of the bids
received on and prior to December 14
last had been rejected on the advice of
Attorney Stratton. "He advised us,"
added Harney, 'that inasmuch as the
bids had not ben opened and acted on
at the advertised time, and because
of the injunction suit brought against
the, board, many legal complica
tions might arise. I acted on his ad- ,
vice, as I did not want to give my
sanction to what might afterward
prove to be a void contract. Attorney
Stratton also advised us that it would
probably be better if we changed the
specifications so as to avoid any pos
sible legal complications."
The cross-examination of Major Har
ney was conducted by Attorney Cope.
"Have you any business other than
that of Harbor Commissioner?" was
asked.
"I have," replied the witness. "I
act as business agent for people en
gaged in mining and other industries."
"What amount of time do you devote
to outside business?"
"About two hours a day," answered
Harney. "I put in about five hours
a day attending to the affairs of the
Harbor Commission and two hours to
my outside business."
"Have you devoted any time to the
study of the best means for preserving
piles?" asked Attorney Cope.
"Yes, sir," answered Harney. "I have |
read the reports of the Harbor Com- j
missioners and civil engineers relative
to creosoting and other means for pre
serving timber. I have made a par
ticular study of pile preserving, as I
think a knowledge of that matter is
most important for a Harbor Commis
sioner to possess."
"Have you ever gone under the
wharves to examine the piles?"
"I have not, but I have received re
ports from wharfingers and foremen."
"Whom have you talked with?"
"I received considerable information
from Wharfinger Buckley concerning
creosoted ptles."
"Is he not rein ted by marriage to P.
F. t>undon?" asked Attorney Cope.
"Not to my knowledge." answered
Harney. "I do know this much, how
ever: Dundon had nothing to do with
Buckley's appointment. I appointed
Buckley and Dundon had nothing to
do with it."
"Is It not a fact," asked Cope, "that
Mr. Irving on behalf of the Parafflne
Paint Company promised to guarantee
piles prepared by his company to last
a certain number of years?"
"I have no recollection of having had
such a conversation," replied Harney.
The rent of the session was then
devoted to an examination of Haney
concerning the length of time piles gen
erally last when treated under the dif
ferent processes. I,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TX T ESDAY, MARCH 1, 1898.
THE BARK OREGON REFUSING A TOW.
ALMOST FROZE
HIS BLOOD
Horrible Sight Presented
to the Gaze of H.
Stern, a Baker.
Thought His Friend, George
Loeffler, Had Been Mur
dered in His Bed.
The Police Found That Loeffler Had
Gone to the Klondike, and
Had Played a Joke.
H. Stern, a baker at 344 Sixth street,
will not recover for a long time from
a shock to his nerves yesterday morn
ing, and the thought of it makes him
shudder when the subject is broached
to him. :â¢'
Yesterday morning between 7 and 8
o'clock he called as usual at the bak
ery of George Loeffler, 721 Brannan
street, between Sixth and Seventh, to
deliver some bread. The front door
was open, which surprised him, and on
entering he was still more surprised
to find a lighted lamp in the bedroom
which Loeffler occupied in the rear of
the store. On casting his eyes upon
the bed he received a shock that al
most froze his blood. He rushed out
of the place and jumping Into his
wagon drove furiously to the South
ern police station and created a tre
mendous sensation by announcing that
Loeffler was lying murdered in his bed.
He told Oiiicer Judson, who was on
station duty, that he saw a towel cov
ered with blood under Loeffler's chin
and there was a bloody knife and re
volver on a table close to the bed. He
was sure that a bloody murder had
been committed. He was. so excited
that he could scarcely speak.
Policeman Heinz was hurriedly sum
moned and was instructed to go with
Stern and make a full investigation.
They drove rapidly to the place and
Stern's excited talk made the officer
feel nervous also. When they arrived
at the bakery Heinz went straight to
the bedroom and the sight staggered
him for a moment, but he examined
the supposed corpse and found to his
disgust that it was only a dummy.
A sack had been stuffed with old
clothes and put under the blankets.
Then an old pair of trousers had been
rolled up to represent as closely as
possible a man's head and over it was
a towel which appeared to be satur
ated with blood. Heinz examined the
knife and revolver, which was an old
rusty one, and on smelling the sup
posed blood he discovered that it was
the extract of root beer.
On the bedroom door were pinned
strips of black and white rags, and on
the front door was a card with the in
scription, "Gone to the Klondike."
The humor of the situation struck
Heinz at once, but not so Stern, who
could not get rid of the thought that
a murder had been committed. Heinz
made inquiry in the neighborhood and
found that Loeffler was very much in
arrears for his rent and was in debt
to a number of people who had sup
plied him with goods. He told a
friend Sunday night that he was go-
Ing to the Klondike and his creditors
could whistle for their money. Before
leaving he took a humorous way of an
nouncing his intention.
PARTNERS AT OUTS.
Robert Hill Swears Out a Warrant
for the Arrest of William
Martin.
Robert Hill swore to a complaint in
Judge Campbell's court yesterday for the
arrest of William Martin on a charge of
assault with a deadly weapon.
Hill said that he and Martin entered
into a partnership about a week .ago to
conduct the restaurant at 4ii9 tfeary
street. Hill had ready money and Martin
promised to furnish his share in a day
or two. As no money was forthcoming
from Martin, Hili told him on Sunday
night that they must dissolve partnership.
This angered Martin and he attacked Hill,
knocking him down and cutting him on
the scalp with a knife.
According to Hill. Martin not only
knocked him down and out him. but also
robbed him of about $15. He wanted a
charge of robbery preferred against Mar
tin also, but Assistant Prosecuting Attor
ney Mann thought It better to await de
velopments before issuing the robbery
warrant.

GAVIGAN WAS
KNOCKED OUT

a Very Queer Trans
action.
Compilation of the Consolida
tion Act Charged to
Counsel Fees.
Brokers, and Not the Attorney, Will
Probably Be the Sub-
: eeU
Auditor r*ro*er<rk opposed- himself
squarely to the Judiciary Committee of
the Board of Supervisors yesterday. by
refusing to audit the demand of W. J.
Gavigan for $490 for special counsel
fees. â â â¢>.. .'â¢'.â  ''' '.''â  . .... ,"-. : v.V:--
G.ivigan was appointed by the com
mittee to compile a pamphlet contain
ing the consolidation act, the amend
ments thereto and the general laws
applying to the city and county of San
Francisco. He drew his warrant against
the fund allowed to the Board of Super
visors for the purpose pi employing
legal talent in special and emergency
cases. The sectic iof the law on which
the demand is based gives the Board
of Supervisors the following power:
"To allow and order paid out of the
general fund not exceeding the sum of
$5000 in any one fiscal year for the em
ployment of special counsel."
The resolution of ihe board speci
fically authorizes the compilation of the
consolidation act and the amendatory
and supplemental acts, and under this
measure Gavigan was employed. Au
ditor Broderick points to section 3 of
the act, which reads as follows:: "To
allow and order paid out of the general
fund of 1860-61 the sum of three hun
dred dollars for compiling and publish
ing the laws and ordinances relating
to the city and county of San Fran
cisco; and for any fiscal year there
after a further sum not exceeding the
sum of $300 for the same purpose."
The Auditor believes that section 3
limits the power of the board in the
matter mentioned, and that as Gavi â¢
gan's demand was in excess of the
total amount of the appropriation and
also drawn against the wrong fund, it

ASKED TO BE LOCKED UP.
Mrs. E. C. White Was Afraid of Kill-
ing Her Daughter With a
Hatchet.
Mrs. E. C. White, who lives in tho Sun
set House, 17 Third street, was taken to
the Receiving Hospital early yesterday
morning by a young man and she asked
to be locked up as she was afraid she
would kill her daughter. She claimed that
her daughter. Pearl Rhodes, who is only
13 years of age, was beginning to load a
fast life and Sunday night because the
girl had been away for several hours with
a stableman next door she became so ner
vous that she took a hatchet and was
going to kill her.
Officer McMurray of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children made
an Investigation into the case yesterday
and was convinced that there was no
cause for the mother's wild outburst, al
though the girl is inclined to be head
strong. The girl will probably be placed
in a public institution.
Mrs. White takes periodical fits of wild
ness and it is not the first time she has
made requests to be locked up to pre
vent her from killing her son or daughter
Her husband is not living with her.

WILL RAISE
THE CORONA
Captain G. Miner Goodall
Says She Will Be Got
Off the Rocks.
After Being Patched Up She
Will Return Under Her
Own Steam.
The Klondike Club of Nantueket, R. 1.,
Has Purchased the Whaling
Bark Mermaid.
It now seems fairly certain that the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
steamer Corona, which went ashore on
Lewis Island while on her way to
Dyea and Skaguay some time ago, will
be saved. She went bow on upon a
pointed rock and the passengers were
saved with much difficulty.
Captain C. Miner Goodall was sent
from here to see what could be done
with the vessel. He secured wrecking
appliances at Victoria, B. C, and he
now reports that with several divers
and with fair weather he will have the
vessel oft' and on her way to San Fran
cisco almost as soon as his communica
tion could be received here. In his
letter to Goodall, Perkins & Co. he
states that the worst place was for
ward under the forehatches. When she
struck a hole was knocked in the
bottom and the keel was turned over
foj- about twenty feet. She overhung
from the foremast forward and most
of the repairing was done from the in
side.
"It has been blowing and snowing
ever since we came here," says Cap
tain Goodall. "It is slow work, but if
it moderates we shall have her afloat
in a week. I think it will be safe to
bring her to San Francisco by slow
stages."
It is Captain Goodall's intention to
i bring the Corona to Port Townsend,
where her cargo will be discharged. The
I coal now in the hold will be kept there
i for ballast, and then the steamer will
! go to Victoria. B. C, in order to com
i ply with the customs regulations of
' that port, as she was wrecked in Brit
i ish waters. The Corona's deck houses
i have all gone aft, but the upper deck
j is good and as there is plenty of lum
ber on board there will be no difficulty
in closing up the stairways and other
openings in order to make the Corona
perfectly seaworthy for her trip to San
Francisco. On her arrival here she
will be docked by the Union Iron
Works and the work of repairing her
will be rushed. In a month's time
she should be ready to go back on the
run between Seattle, Dyea and Ska
guay.
The demand for steamers and tugs
for the Klondike trade is not nearly
J satisfied. The Redstack Towboat Com
pany has two boats on the Sound tow
ing sailing vessels from Seattle to Dyea
and they are getting two more ready
for the trade. The Wizard and Her
cules have been laid up for nearly four
years, but they are now being put in
first-class order, and will be put in
commission in a few days. The Wizard
has had hf>r boilers made almost as
good as new and she has had a new
smokestack and a new propeller put in.
The Hercules is having her boilers and
engines thoroughly overhauled at the
Fulton Iron Works, and both tugs will
be ready for their trial trips the latter
part of this week.
The Klondike Club of Nantucket, R.
L has purchased the whaling bark
Mermaid" and are going to Kotzebue
Sound in her. A party of fifteen Nan
tucket whalemen formed the club last
winter, intending to go to the Klon
dike. They changed their minds, how
ever, and Captain Wicks and H. ami
J Borden came out here to purchase
a vessol. The Mermaid will be brought
out of Oakland Creek to-day and will
be made ready for her trip to the Arc
tic next May.
The ship Sintram, with the river
steamers and barges for the North
American Trading and Transportation
Company aboard, will not get away
for Dutch Harbor before next Satur
day or Sunday. The refrigerating
plants for use on the steamers have
not arrived from the East, hence the
delay. The steamers will also be fitted
Pozzoni's Complexion
Powder produces a soft and beautiful skint I

purity â 
with salt water condensers, electric
light plants and Admiralty search !
| lights. One of the boats will run be
tween St. Michael and the mouth of !
the Yukon, while the other three will
run up the river to Dawson.
The engineers and machinists going j
to Dutch Harbor on the Sintram to |
take charge of the boats when com
pleted are: George R. Kingsland, the
present chief engineer of the Naval Mi
litia: E. H. Mitchell, H. Coy.en, W.
Dunn and Sam Griffith. Mr. Kingsland
will be superintendent and the others ;
will be chief engineers. The assist- j
ant engineers are F. Clawson, R. E. ,
Wilkinson, Con L. Martin and W. A. ;
Keen, while the electricians are H.
Mozart and Tom Palmer.
John P. Gough was taken to the
Harbor Receiving Hospital yesterday
from the Arizona bonded warehouse
suffering from a fracture of the skull.
Drs. Deas and Diggins did everything
possible for the unfortunate man, but
he lived only a few hours. He was i
at work on some bales of hay, when
fine of them fell on him and crushed
him to the floor. The deceased was i
a married man and resided with his
family at 971 Harrison street. Gough's
father was killed in an accident and
this was the third one in which the de-*
ceased had suffered.
The Alaska Packers' Association's
steamer President, from Yaquina Bay
to San Francisco, broke her shaft off
Greenwood, Mendocino County, this
morning. The sea was calm and tht*
steamer proceeded under sail. The ;
Spreckels tugboat Vigilant left at 4 p. ;
m. to tow the President to San Fran
cisco.
Had No Property.
W. Hunt, a shoemaker living at 2659
Mission street, swore to a complaint in
Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday for
the arrest of Thomas Cree on a charge
of grand larceny. February 24 Cree wont
to Hunt and askod for a loan of $300.
Riving him a mortgage on a lot on Myrtle
street and Eighth avenue as security.
Hunt later became suspicious and em
ployed an attorney to search the records
with the result that Oreo's name was not
found as a property owner and further
that there was no Myrtle street in the
city.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 28.â Fiesta
de Los Angeles, for the year 1898, the
annual festival in which all southern
California, and more : particularly, the
citizens of Lob Angeles, have taken
great pride and pleasure in the past,
will probably be held, despite the fact
that the two great railroad companies
'entering the city have by the policy
,1,. liuve pursued endeavored to defeat
it. . â¢ . â¢â¢. :".-. " â¢ 'â :â 
â 'â¢â ; The fiesta has become a- feature in
I this Section of the State, and during the
several years it has been held in the
past it has always been a success; It
has, generally speaking, been handled
and rii&naged with business tact and
sagacity, arid has caused the city to be
advertised throughout the effete Bast
in a way which has certainly been pro
ductive or most satisfactory results to
all .who have the true Interests .of
Southern California at heart. .
; :it is a spring festival and a week is
given, Â ,1 to the entertainment and
pleasure. of thousands of guests who
came to the city for recreation arid en
joyment. Every day of the week is
.'generally" covered- in the programme
by a special feature in the way of an
â attraction. Naturally the crowds that
come to attend the fiesta are a class
of gay and blithsome merry-makers.
They come to have 0 good time, within
the bounds of order and decency. They
are neither long faced, sad appearing
nor sanctimonious. For this reason
some of the more religiously Inclined
have not looked upon the Fiesta with
favor â¢ . â â ';â¢ . 'â '.â  â¢:â '
But from a business standpoint the
j annual holding of the fiesta at the

: incalulable benefit to Los Angeles. It
has brought .the interior merchant to
the city and the wholesale dealer has
had an opportunity to extend the cour- '
tesies to his customers. The great
masses have availed themselves of the
opportunity during . the visit to the
fiesta to either renew or open up for the
first business, relations with the retail
merchant. ' : v "--â¢â¢:.' â  â  â .. â¢: â¢
The Eastern visitors, many of whom
a?-.- still here in April, have always en
joyed the fiesta and have gone East to
tell of the great.. celebration and the
generally excellent, manner In which
it was handled.
The South. Pacific and the Santa
Fe railroads?, both of which extensively \
cover Southern California, have always
profited largely by the fiestas. They
have carried hundreds of thousands of
people to and from the city and their
homes during the annual celebration, i
With the usual and customary liberal- !
ity of great corporations that are the |
, most benefited by any public movement
[both roads have In the past made. sub- i
scriptions!, in extent about one-fourth
what they ought to have done, to as
sist in advertising and making the
preliminary arrangements for the week
'of fun. .. â¢ â  â¢ :: : ; -"â¢ â â¢'..â  â â  â¢ â â ]
This year, though, the Santa Fe and
Southern Pacific companies, with that
rare public spirit for which they. are
both noted, declined to subscribe One
dollar for the fiesta, . The Santa Fe had
just passed to new . management in
Southern California and the directing
! spirit, Mr. W. G. Nevln. absolutely re
fused to consider the proposition of as
sisting in arranging for the spring fes
tival. â  ;;-.' , : s-:.:-, . :
The Southern Pacific Company, so it
is stated* stood prepared to subscribe j
jitVK) provided the Santa Fe put up a '
' like sum. and there were citizens ready
to subscribe $2600 provided the railroad j
' companies gave their usual subscrip- j
tions. The street railway companies]
; made a subscription of $1500 under like
conditions. But there wore enterpris- j
â â  ing people who signed for $6000 uncon- j
ditionally. '.-'.'
All told $16,000 was required to make
i the fiesta an assured success, but the
dog in the manger policy of the Santa
Fe road seemed to be in a fair way to
block the whole proposition, until a few
j days ago. when under the leadership of
such men as F. K. Rule, C. S. Walton
and others it was decided that an effort
should be put forth to hold a fiesta de
spite the Southern Pacific and Santa
Fe roads.
There was $t>ooo unconditionally sub
scribed. The citizens who had sub
scribed the $2500 conditionally, and the
street-railroad companies who had put
down $1500, practically waived the con
ditions surrounding their contributions.
This made SIO.OOO that had been se
cured, provided the remaining $6000
could be raised.
The work of securing it has been In
augurated with zest. M. A. Hamburger,
one of the most enterprising merchants
in this part of the State, when he
, learned of the condition matters were
in, doubled his subscription from $250
to $500. and from other sources sub
: scriptions were obtained, so that the
. deficiency is now only about $4000, with
I every prospi?et of its being raised.
It will be a great victory for the peo
| ple if a fiesta is held this year. It
will show the Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe roads that, despite their tight
| and parsimonious policy, the people can
: manage to worry along without them
and about anything they undertake.
i Of course, if the required $4000 is not
1 raised, then It will be taken as con
clusive evidence that a fiesta, is not
desired. But it now looks as though
the money would be at hand and that
i within a very short time. Fiesta de
Los Angeles will this year be the event
, for the last week of April.

Parricide's Fate,

HAN JOSE, Feb. 28. âThe work of se
lecting a jury to try Thomas W. Flan
nelly for the murder of his father, Pat
rick Flannelly, at Redwood City on Oc
tober 26. began in Judge Liorigan's
court this morning. The case, was
brought here on a change of venue
from San Mtiteo County. The fact that
Flannelly is a parricide, and also in
flicted injuries that resulted in the
death of Sheriff w. p. McEvoy. when
that Officer attempted to arrest him,
has attracted a great deal of attention.
ami at the opening of court the room

by. District Attorney Ilorrin'gton of this
city, will prosecute the case. . .:
Flannelly sat beside . his attorneys,
He was a little.^ nervous, at first and
seemed to shudder at: remarks on ..the
death penalty, but this soon wore off
arid he regained: thai stoical look that
has characterised him since his arrest.
Flannelly's pleai will 'â¢'.be Belf defense
This was a surprise to the prosecution,
as it- has been given out that tempo
rary insanity would be urged, and a
number of experts had been summoned
by the prosecution. 1 The questioning of
the venire summoned for jurymen
showed that Attorneys Straus and
Rhiel will try to prove justifiable homi
cide, v Aside from the usual questions
asked the -talesmen, each one was
asked if 7' he considered it a greater
crime for a man to kill his own father
than some other/person.
District Attorney Harrington made a
short opening statement of the case.

Sheriff Mansfield discovered the where
abouts of Willetts from the man â  himself.
A short time ago lie received a letter
from a person in Falrpark, Ariz., offering
to give information about Wllletta pro
vided the reward of $288 was Sent htm. He
also showed a knowledge of the rase, that

THE SUNDRY CIVIL
APPROPRIATION BILL
Passed in the House After Elimina
tion of Aid for the Paris
Exposition.
. WASHINGTON', Feb. 2s.â House
! passed the sundry civil appropriation bill
to-day after a four days' debate. The
most important action to-day was the
elimination of an appropriation for rep- ;
resentation at the Paris Exposition on a ]
point of order. The sudden change of i
sentiment in the House, which is often i
â witnessed when members go. on record,
was twice illustrated to-day. On Friday
last the House, in committee of the whole,
! where there is ho record of the rote,
knocked out a provision in the bill for an
appropriation to pay those who furnished
the Government with information leading
to the conviction of the violators of the
! internal revenue laws and to-day in com
mittee an extra month's pay was voted
to the employes of the House. Both these
propositions commanded a very respect
; able majority in the committee, but when
j the members voted on roll calls in the
House both of them were overwhelmingly
defeated. Several minor bills were passed
after the sundry civil bill was disposed of.

RECEPTION TO
GENERAL BOOTH
The Leader of the Salvation Army En=
thusiasticaliy Received by His
Followers.
AccompanieJ by His Staff, the Veteran Evangelist Is Con
ducting a Soul-Saving Campaign in
the West.
IT IS the victory of the red jersey; it is the triumph of the blue
bonnet.
When Paderewski came upon the California stage the first night
of his appearance here the theater was as crowded as it was yes
terday when General Booth spoke. But not all the art. not all the
genius of the musician could evoke the surge of enthusiasm that
Bwepi through that crowd facing the swaying figure of the tall, white
haired old Englishman who drops his h's and in his excitement forgets
all about syntax, while he seizes his auditor in the grasp of his earnest
ness and holds his attention riveted to the religious theme he is playing
upon.
I never saw a more remarkable scene than that at the California
yesterday; the great, rapt audience murmuring and praying and
groaning and sighing in a sort of ."Static accompaniment to the
speaker's appeal; the semi-obscurity of the body of the theater and
the light upon the stage where General Booth sat surrounded by the
officers of the Salvation Army, the speakers of the day and the band;
the beautiful self-unconsciousness of the women and the grave devo
tion of the men; the fervor of the speakers and the responsive enthu
siasm of the audience; the pleading of the saved and the marvelous
l] courage of the repentant sinner at the penitent's bench: the
skillful playing on the human heart from the stage and the contagious
.xi Itement in the eager, prayerful multitudeâ it is an amazing, a
marvelously effective picture, considered wholly apart from its reli
gious aspect.
There is a cheeriness, a surprising good humor manifest in the pro
ceedings of this most interesting revival. The voices of the speakers
breathe hope and comfort and sometimes humor, and the vast audi
ence, borrowing their tone, grow enthusiastically happy, till even their
groans are hopeful ones.
"Are you glad this sou! has been saved?" asked a speaker, stand
ing with his arms outstretched to the kneeling crowd before him.
"Yes:" It was a sigh of grateful relief.
"Are you really glad?"
"Yes!" It was an exclamation from thousands of throats, and
thousands of hearts, too.
â¢â¢Really, really glad?" he demanded again in a repetitive crescendo
of excitement and fervor.
"Yes! yes!" It was a shout of triumph.
"Clap your hands then, and say 'I'm glad.' "
And the roar of the answering voices was accompanied by the
sharp, echoing clap of boating palms.
Genera', Booth's voice is very deep, not musical, almost unpleasant
when one first hears it. He stands rocking upon his heels as he speaks.
His gestures are forcible, vehement: his voice becomes raucous as he
reiterates a phrase, emphasizing it with every faculty, with all the
strength there is in him.
One looks from the wonderful old man, the creator of it all, to the
half-breathing houseâ so beloved is he. so anxious are they to hear
every wordâ and marvels how he did it. His questions are searching.
He will not pause or turn aside if words fail him. But he'll express that
which has come to him though it tak>- every fiber of his mind and of
his body to do it. His words become almost living with the empha
sis, the repetition, the force with which he utters them. His delivery
is very inartistic, but to the power, the eloqu< nee of it worlds testify.
In Colonel Lawley one recognizes with admiration that ever-ad
mirable thingâ a being fit for his work. When at the close of General
Booth's last appeal a hesitating figure with its face turned up to the
rm walked down to the penitents' benchâ the first of the after
noon's convertsâ the father of the Salvationists yielded his place to
Colonel Lawley.
You should see, you should hear this man. For only personal expe
rience will convince you of his power. He's a perfectly commonplace
looking little man, with a heavy brown beard, and the sweetest, the
strongest of tenors. But his manner of conducting a revival is the most
delicately artistic, the most effective that one could imagine.
When the first words come from his lips you are not sure as to
whether he is singing or speaking. He half-intones the words of the
hymn, singing deliberately and enunciating with perfect clearness,
and the muffled notes of the cornet accompany him, no matter what
the vagaries he interpolates in his Bongr, which is at once a prayer and
a battle cry. The music of this man's voice and the effect of his fervid
eloquence put a new meaning into Btereotyped phrases. When he
sings a verse of an old hymn one wonders whether he ever heard it be
fore.
The quivering mass of praying people had just finished singing the
hymn Lawley had begun, accompanying it with the full, soft, rhythmic
clapping of thousands of hands. Colonel Lawley leaned over from the
Btage and looking down upon the devout lassies, their sweet, blue
bonneted faces touching the very floor; In their prayerful pleading, he
said, "Pray, lassie."
And, rising to her feet, a woman took up the thread of the speak
er's appeal, her full, strong contralto voice rising in impassioned
prayer, while she clasped her hands and turned her inspired face up
ward.
Colonel Lawley did not wait for the last word. There are no chill
ing pauses in this great revivalist's programme. Before the lassie's
voice had ceased to tremble upon the air Colonel Lawley's voice, very
soft, very sweet, infinitely persuasive, had begun:
"O the Lion of Judah!" And the "O" blended beautifully with the
last contralto note of the woman's sobbing speech.
"A minister said to me," said General Booth in the opening of his
speech, "that it was a marvelous test to see a man walk clear down
from the gallery of the theater before all that crowd and fall down be
fore the penitents' bench."
It is a marvel. It's an educating sight, too; one well worthâall
religion apartâ going to see. I stopped when I had reached the lobby
on my way out and stood looking back into the darkened theater over
the bowed heads to the stage beyond, where all the men and women
had risen now and were leaning forward, facing that harp with a
thousand strings which vibrated to every touch that swept it. A shrill
whistle sounded from the stage.
"The Seventh! The Seventh!" Colonel Lawley cried.
And down the- center aisle of the theater a Salvation lassie passed,
her head held high with pride, her eyelids lowered in sweetest humility
and her lips quivering with exquisite content. Behind her walked a
man, his eyes set rigidly before him, his feet following patiently in
the path of his captor. Never captive was dragged at more merciful
chariot wheels; never conqueror experienced a purer triumph.
"And now I am happy all the day!"
The strains of the music, and the tenor's voice above all, followone
ou* into the lobby. MIRIAM MICHELSON.
GENERAL WILLIAM BOOTH.
the founder of the Salvation
Army was given a rousing re
ceptton yesterday on his second
visit to the array corps of San
Francisco. About three years
ago the general was in this city and
a? that time the visit was made
the occasion of the grandest rally ever
held by the different corps of the bay
< -Ities For this event even greater
preparations were made, and yesterday
when the general stepped from the
icrry-boat the army officers announced
that the entry of their leader into the
. ity marked the commencement of ihe
greatest soul-saving campaign that had
ever been contemplated in San Fran
cisco.
General Booth was accompanied by
his daughter, Mrs. Booth-Tucker. Com
mander Tucker, the leader of the Sal
vation forces in America; Colonel Law
ley and Commissioner Nicol. The
founder of the great philanthropic
movement arid his companions were es- i
corted direct to the California Theater.
There the house was packed to the last
seat in the gallery.
The colors of the army were conspic
uously displayed and words of wel
come on banners adorned the walls.
As the general and his companions
stepped on. the stage the rank and file
of the army rose and gave a rous
ing greeting to the visitors with a vol
ley of hallelujahs. The general waved
his hands to the audience in response
and the meeting was in full blast.
The army band struck up the strains
of one of the popular songs of the or
ganization, and that great audience
was singing it with a will before their
leader had time to get to a seat that
was reserved for him.
Commander Booth-Tucker then led
in prayer and the general stepped to
the front and gave out the hymn,
"Cleansing for Me," remarking as he
read the lines the significance of the
words. After the hymn a collection
was taken up, and while the lassies
were passing through the audience Col
onel Lawiey sang, "He's Able to Save."
Then General Booth began his ad
dress.
"I am glad to be in California onco
more," he said. "I was here three
years ago and then the manifestations
of God's grace were so powerful that I
have been talking of it ever since
wherever I go. We have had a good
time in this State. There have been
some remarkable smashings in the
enemy's camp. We have had % good
time in Oakland. All who feel good
for being there say amen."
There was a roar ot amens from the
great audience.
"We had seventy-five join the ranks
of God. I feel that is gratifying.
Those who feel that gratification with
me say hallelujah."
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 1, 1898.
"Hallelujah! " shouted the crowd and
the general smiled his approval.
"In coming across the bay this morn
ing the sun shone down on us in a blazo
of light. There is just as much sun
shine In God's righteousness.
"Now for salvation. Is there any
body here hungry for righteousness?
St. Paul, seventh chapter and first
verse, says: 'Having therefore, dearly
beloved, these promises, let us cleanse
ourselves from all filth of the flesh and
the spirit, and be perfectly holy in the
fear of God.' In the spiritual world
there is no filth. God made a place for
filth by scooping out hell. The spirit
ual place is good and pure, and all bad
ness is in hell. When that division is
made, my friends, where shall you be?
Many a man's body is the damnation
of his soul by the filthiness of the flesh
and the awful appetites that lead to
that fllthlness of the body and the soul.
I need not remark about the vast
amount of filth in the world. I have
been asked many times if the world is
not getting better. I may not be a good
judge, but I can say the world is get
ting more civilized and more comfort
able, and perhaps there are fewer vul
gar evils, but it cannot be said that the
world is more godly, more meek and
holy, and more enthusiastically righte
c-us. Anyhow, it is bad enough.
"Millions and millmns have been
washed in the blood and sought salva
tion, but just look around. Millions and
millions of rich and poor are living in
a world of filth. They go around with
the name of God on their lips believing
in conversion, attending churches,
reading the Bible and partaking of sac
raments, yet they have a lot of filthi
ness in their hearts. , A converted man
is cleansed and he emerges from the
blackness of filth to the glorious sun
shine of God's righteousness. Even
after conversion many of the old hab
its are left in the heart. The converted
always have to fight pride, malice, an
ger and covetousness. God hates that
filth. Let us cleanse ourselves from it
all. We must not take the Bible for
what we believe of it, but we must
take it all. God will be a father to you
but you must be free from filthiness
when you come to him. Now, who will
come?"
BOOTH IN ACTION AND REPOSE
The Founder and Leader of the Salvation Armu Forces of the World Who Is
Now Conducting a Camoaign in This City.
The QeuÂ£?s.l cleared a place in front
of the stage, and pointing to it as the
mercy seat asked penitents to come for
ward. In his appeals he was assisted
by Commander Bouth-Tucker and Colo
nel Lawley. For about an hour they
exhorted with the sinners in the au
dience, and seventeen went forward
and received the consolation the gen
eral promised.
The local corps of the army assem
bled early in the afternoon at the bar
racks on Mission street, near Third,
and termed for parade under direction
of Staff Captain Dunham. About five
hundred soldiers and lassies joined in the
parade and the line of march was along
Mission street to New Montgomery,
then down to Bush and up that street
to the theater, arriving there when the
afternoon meeting opened at 3 o'clock.
The soldiers marched into the hall, and
when they were seated the general
made his appearance on the stage. He
was again greeted by a volley of "glor
ies."
The meeting commenced at once.
Commander Booth-Tucker announced a
song and after it Commissioner Nicol
led in prayer. The address of the
general was directed more particularly
to the soldiers of the army.
"O Lord, what shall I say when Is
rael turneth their backs before their
enemies?" was the text he chose. "It
was the lamentation of Joshua on the
defeat of the Israelites," he said.
"What was the cause of their de
feat? It was because of sin in the
camp. That is the reason you do not
get on in religions work. There is
sin in your camp. God has left you.
If your religious experience is one of
victory, then you know God is with
you. If you are defeated, you should
inquire the reason. Let us look for
the reasons for defeat. Do you do
anything in your business that is for
bidden? Is there any lying, cheating
or any deceit? If so. there is tho
reason. Are you earning your bread
and cheese by anything that is not
right in the sieht of God? Give it up
if you are; better to starve in this
world than to be damned for all time
to come.
"Look to your personal habits. Ob
literate all the vanities you have. Look
to your companionship. Have rela
tions with no one who is not pure in
the sight of God. Perhaps it is In the
treatment of your families. Look to
it and cleanse yourselves of all your
sins. There is no hope for you unless
you confess and make yourself right
with God."
Then followed an exhortation for sin
ners to turn to God and again the pen
itent bench was lined with converts.
The theater was crowded at the even
ing meeting. Long before the time for
commencing the exercises nearly all the
available standing-room was taken.
The general was a few minutes late in
reaching the hall, and when he entered
the stage, followed by his staff, the
band blared and he was greeted with
cheer after cheer and shouts of "halle
lujah " The meeting commenced at
once Commander Booth-Tucker an
nounced a song and it went along with
a swing with the band leading. Mrs.
Booth-Tucker led in prayer and Co-lo
nel Lawley sang. "Hark You the Sav
ior Knocking." Then General Booth ad
vanced to the center of the stage.
"This is the last salvation meeting I
will have with you this campaign. I
am sorry for it. I have enjoyed my
meetings with you. To-morrow I shall
talk erf sin in this hall. Next day I will
attend soldier meetings and then I will
be away to Portland on my campaign.
Now for to-night. So far in Oakland
and here 105 have come to the Lord.
How many will come to-night?"
He then read a passage from the 20th
chapter of Revelations that told of the
day of judgment. "There will be no
disagreement in this audience," he said,
"that then- will be a general judgment
day. What I mean by that is that God
will inquire into man's righteousness
and judge him accordingly. There is a
universal conscientiousness that those
who do wrong should be punished. As
it is however, in this world the wicked
are not always punished.
"Wicked people do not like to con
template that day. It will be a ter
rible ordeal for us all, but I am glad
such a day is to come. Then the
righteous will be awarded and the
wicked punished. The making of this
world was an important event. The re
deeming of it was an important event.
It was the greatest event In the his
tory of the world sir.c-e it was made.
The day when God saves a man's soul
is an Important day, and it will be'a
wonderful day when God winds up the
universe. I want to drive it into your
souls the Importance of this judgment
day."
The general then gave a most gra
phic description of the scenes that he
declared would take place before the
great white throne when evry man
comes to judgment. He pictured a
glorious throng on the right side of the
throne whose names were written in
letters of gold upon a great book, and
on the left another throng whose
names were written in letters of black
ness. Then he told of the journeys
of the two throngs. One passing in
tli rough pearly gates to everlasting
happiness, and the other down Into the
bottomless pit, there to suffer the end
less tortures of the damned.
"God grant that none in this house
"be in that blyck promenade," he im
plored. "We will all have to be there
to take our trial. If your name is on
the right side nothing can keep you
back. If it is on the black book no
power but God can save you. He will
save you if he can, but he will damn
you if he must. Which shall it be?"
Then commenced an exhortation to
plead for forgiveness and righteous
ness at the mercy seat, and during the
evening twenty went forward, amid

SOLDIERS ON PARADE.
The Evening Meeting Heralded
by a Procession of the
Army Corps.
The members of the different corps
of the army in the city turned out in
parade last night just before the even
ing meeting. They assembled at the
army headquarters on Market street,
and under the folds of their flag
marched down Market street and
along Kearny to Bush and to the thea
ter. There were i>ver 500 soldiers and
lassies in line, and with their bands
they made an imposing show. Some
of the lassies were dressed in the na
tional costumes of many of the prin
cipal nations where the army has its
greatest strength. Many of the lassies
were robed in white, and they made an
attractive feature of the procession.
The orphans who are protected by the
organization were driven along the line
of march in a 'bus, and they sang the
familiar songs of the army as they
passed along the street. The order of
the procession was as follows :
â  Stand of colors.

PAVILION ECHOES WITH LOYAL TRIBUTES TO MARTYRS OF THE MAINE.
IN spite of many other attractions .
and much to divert the minds of the ,
people from Indoor performances,
there was a large attendance at the
Miners' Fair for the benefit of the sur
viving relatives of the Maine disaster
H Thnse who attended the fair fell into
the spirit of the occasion, feeling that,
â¢while the programme itself was in
tensely interesting, they were giving
the tribute of their presence more to
â¢the cause of the unfortunate dead than
to the entertainment. This spirit was
evinced time and again, when the peo
ple gave vent to their feelings on such
occasions as the playing of national
airs.
In addition to many entertaining fea- â 
tores there was a general spirit of i
gcod-feliowship throughout the Pavil
lon. The vaudeville features of the en
tertainment were numerous. A com- â 
popite view of the various performances j
â¢would show a wide range of features, !
being what an old showman called
"a big show for two bits in any coun- ;
try" . ,
There are fine prospects of good re
turns from the proposed auction sale
Of goods. More than $1000 was realized
from the two performances yesterday,
and there is a prospect that the auc
tion sales will swell this sum to a figure
that will do a great deal of good to
those left in distress.
The evening's programme was
opened by the Martels in their bicycle;
act, which was loudly applauded. Each
SCENES AX THE BENEFIT TO THE FAMILIES OF THE MAINE'S DEAD
cf these clever little people did a sep
arate turn and then performed together
on one wheel. Next followed George
S. MeihJlng and Walter lln.it; <>f the
Olympic Club in their La Perch act,
-which was really the bost feature of
the entire programme. This same dif
ficult act has never beer, done any more
SHORTHAND AT
A LONG PRICE
Braunhart's Arraignment
of Court Stenog-
raphers.
SPublic Sentiment Aroused
Against a Pernicious
System,
Clause In the New Charter by
Which Belief May Be
Secured.
The exorbitant bills collected from ;
the city by the stenographers of the j
several Police Courts have aroused j
public sentiment against a system j
which permits such wholesale depletion !
of the city treasury. A desire to find ;
some means by which the evil can be
corrected is earnestly expressed.
State Senator Samuel Braunhart, j
who is thoroughly familiar with every j
detail relating to the pernicious system
by which stenographers run up such ;
enormous bills; yesterday gave his ,
views on the subject.
"I am informed." he said, "that in j
many instances the only reason for ;
holding persons to answer before the j
Grand Jury, after preliminary exarnin- j
ation before the Police Judges, is to
pile up enormous stenographic bills, the |
Grand Jury almost invariably dismiss- â 
Ing the cases on the ground that there j
was no probable cause.
"When persons charged with a felony
are not held there can be no charges
for transcribing testimony, and many j
have been held over for this reason j
only. I brand this as an outrage not
only against innocent persons, but a
technical excuse for pilfering the pub-
Jic treasury.
"At the last session of the Legisla
ture I introduced a reform police court
bill which, had it been passed, would
have corrected the evils existing, not
alone saving enormous sums to the tax- I
payers, but also protecting the inno
cent against long imprisonment while ,
awaiting trials or investigation by the j
Grand Jury. The fees collected under j
the present law allow $10 per diem for |
the taking of testimony, 15 cents per j
gracefully or with more perfect ease
and dexterity by the Daubignes of
Paris or the Zarones of Calcutta than
it was performed last night by the two
San Franciscan atheletes.
M. C. Lawrence, the great trick
bicycle rider, next gave a clever exhi
bition of what can be done upon a
wheel. Some of his feats were marvel
ous. They were accomplished with a
charming degree of grace. His style
of performing is totally different from
that of the Martels.
The Lazello Brothers, in their Span
ish ring exhibition, were the next fea
ture, and they pave their same smooth
performance. The pupils of the Frank
lin Grammar School were assembled
upon the stage and sang three selec
tions under the direction of one of the
! teachers of the school. Their voices
i were heard with excellent effect over
i the entire Pavilion. The numbers ren
dered by the school were the National
! Russian hymn, an English glee song
and numbers from Hoffman and
Brahms. .
"The Battle of Winchester" was the
culminating feature of the evening and
was a marked success. The California
Male Quartet sang the war songs,
while Company M. under command of
Captain G. F. O'Neal, furnished the
tiring of the infantry. This served to
heighten the realism of the scene, and
the musical description as furnished
by Bennett's band, under the direction
of Walter B. Rodjjers. completed the
effect of the memorable and bloody en
counter. At its conclusion the vast au
dience expressed its pleasure by loud
and prolonged applause.
With the fair in its last week of life,
the management is crowding the best
features into the last few days. To
day the "League of the Cross" and its
many friends will take possession of
the Pavilion. The ladies will be given
dainty cups and saucers. Lawrence,
the famous trick rider, will also ap

"The bill introduced by me in the
Senate provides for a salary of $150 per
month and for 10 cents per folio for
transcribing and 5 cents per folio for
copying. The bill was passed in the
Senate as early as January 27. thirty
two Senators voting In the affirmative
and none against.
"As soon as the bill had been referred
to the Assembly Judiciary Committee
it met with the opposition of Assembly
man Dibble of this city, who appeared
at the several meetings of the commit
tee when the bill was under considera
tion, invariably pleading for postpone
ment. Fearing that the measure would
die upon the file, I insisted upm its be
ing taken up at once. Mr. Dibble then
moved that it be referred to the San
Francisco delegation, evidently for the
purpose of gaining time.
"Knowing that Mr. Dibble would do
all in his power to prevent the bill be
coming active, I called upon Assembly
man Mulcreavy, chairman of the San
Francisco delegation, for assistance, in
forming him of Dibble's attitude to
ward the measure. He assured me that
I could rely upon him to checkmate
Dibble when the bill came up for final
passage. On March 12, when the bill
was again reached, Mr. Dibble moved
that it be referred to the San Francisco
delegation, and it was so ordered With
out any opposition.
"This was the death blow to the bill,
as there being but eight days interven
ing before adjournment it could not
imam be reached. I implored Mr. Mul
creavy to report it back again imme
"Assemblyman L.acey then circulated
a petition, which was signed by a ma
jority of the San Francisco delegation,
requesting Mr. Mulcreavy to report the
bill back at once so that a final vote
could be taken thereon in the Assem
bly, to which he paid no attention.

Everett Thomas was called for cross
examination, and stated that he had
heard a shot in the store of Hoffman,

evening of June 1. The witness was ex
cused, and M. M. Rice, a miner, testified
that he had passed the store at 6:30

Thomas Turnbul! testified that on the
evening of the killing he had seen Isaac
Hoffman in front of the store. on the
Battery-street side at 6:32 o'clock on the
night in question and had spoken to him
as" he passed by. He stated that he knew
Isaac Hoffman from the fact that his
daughter had worked as a nursegiri in
the home of Isaac Hoffman and that he

his place of business at 6:26 o'clock on the
evening of June 1, and that: he -had met'
Officer Ferrenbach on Front street. when
about a half block from the store of Hoff
man, Kothehild & Co. He also stated he

It was unmistakably a "Robin Hood"Â«
crowd that filled the Baldwin to the i
limit last night, and raised storms of
complimentary noises over the good old
tunes of young Mr. De Koven. Per- j
sons who habitually practice staying
away from the theater turn out when j
the Bostonians are in town and "Robin j
Hood" the bill. The seductive qualities
of this merry masterpiece are unprece- j
dented and unrepeated in the r -counts
of American comic opera. HfÂ»*. Ue Ko
ven has written many things since
"Robin Hood"â lots of lively comic op- j
eras and tons of stodgy music criticism
for the World and rise Journal; but he
has never since fondled the popular ear |
with thesweet Insistenceof his flrstsuc
cess. I can remember when nearly all
the critics had th^ir little fling at ;
"Robin Hood," when the scores of old
England and young Italy were ran- j
sacked to prove De Koven a musical :
Belasco. I remember myself, young and
positive, declaring that Mr. De Koven j
had spoiled an excellent Italian tune |
with his treacley "Promise Me." Nu\v
we let all that pass. "Robin Hood" is
sublimated beyond reach of the carping j
critic; it is serenely indestructible; its j
trans-Atlantic folk themes are the for- j
gotten Holenshed.theexclusive Boccac
cio, of a master; its jolly good cheer de- i
fles the boneful clatter of the paid \
skeleton at the feastâ and I would !
sooner praise it.
One performance of "Robin Hood" by j
the Boatonians differs very little from
another, and they are all good. I j
think the lasting popularity of the I
work is largely due to the fact that it j
and prompt response. All articles
given, unless retained in the booths as
portions of displays, were handed over
to Mr. Filcher, in the State Board of
Trade department of the fair. They
embrace many curiously interesting as
veil as decidedly valuable articles. One
firm gave a huge pair of genuine Nor
never has passed out of 'the hands of
this capable company â never gone;
through the terrible test of being man- ;
gled by third-rate people. Subsidiary !
singers, good, bad and indifferent, come ;
and go in the Bostonians, but most of
the original favorites have stayed and
the newcomers are carefully schooled
in the traditions of the parts. This sea
son the company, if not in every re- â 
spect as strong as in the old days, is
stronger than it was a couple of years :
ago. There is a good balance in the j
voices, a willing chorus that acts as
well as sings and plenty of promising ;
understudies. One of these latter, Mr.
Havvley, was called in after the first act i
to supplement the tired throat of Mac
donald, who was having a troubled
time of it with the vocal end of Little
John. Mr. Hawley sang "Brown Oc- I
tober Ale" with more valor than dis- |
cretion, for as the encores piled up
each one of them found rather less of '
him. Having done the work, Mr. Haw
ley retired, Macdonald resuming play,
and strode through the rest of the piece
with large address.
Everybody else in the cast seemed
to be feeling quite well. Barnabee
must have pushed the hands? back sev
eral hours. His Sheriff was as good
as new. Jessie Bartlejtt Davis sang
"Promise Me" as only she can, with
that surging sweetness of subterranean j
chest notes, and acted the part of
Alan-a-Dale with fine boyishness. j
Cowles, of course, was gloriously to the
front as Will Scarlet. He did some
strange thing to the "Armorer's Song" \
that made it less effective than usual, j
but in everything else he was unfail- j
ingly magnetic. Mr. Philp, the tenor, j
who had a beggarly part in "The Ser- '
enade," came out of hiÂ» obscurity with
signal fortune in the part of Robin
Hood. His voice is not colossal, but it
is of most companionable quality and '
delicately managed, even to the point
of singing falsetto, without making ab
â  solute crime of it. And Mr. Philp acts
j with telling grace and earnestness.
Frothingham got his usual fun out
of Friar Tuck, and reliable Josephine I
, Bartlett took good rare of Dame Bur- i
i den. Miss Giusti's acting. I regret to j
i say, was inadequate even to the mod- |
est demands of Annabel.
Alice Nielsen's Maid Marian was a
foregone conclusion. In point of sound it
was excellent. She sang the not often
used exhibition piece, the "Forest
Song," and shamed the flute in the
frills. But she acted with a vaudeville
sauciness that did not key with the ro
mantic side of the opera nor with the
sacred traditions of the Bostonians.
ASHTON STEVENS.
Tivbli.
"The Geisha" came back to the Tivoli
last night, with practically the same cast
and the same admirable scenic Investit
ure that marked tike production of sev
eral months ago. The only change was
that Mr. Raffael played Mr. Dunbar's
old part of Fairfax. He did well. Mr.
Stevens was copiously himself in the part
of the proud Marquis. Mr. Leary got the
usual fun from the Chinese. Miss Hall
was a very live English heroine, and Miss
wegian "skis," a peculiar kind of snow
shoes, about fifteen feet long. It is
presumed some one will bid these In
and help benefit the Maine fund. A
steam pump has also been contributed.
A lady's tailor-made suit, a case of
fruit salts, a barrel of crackers, two
boxes of macaroni, two live pigs, a
Wolcott was modest and melodious as O
Mimosa San. All the parts were played
and sung with the enthusiasm of a
premiere, and naturally with much more
familiarity and schooled co-operation.
"The Geisha" itself, as well as the Tivoli
performance of it. has been reviewed at
an earlier date than this. It is the most
internationally successful of all the mod
ern musical comedies, the best of any of
an Oriental locale mat has been written
since "The Mikado." In London. "The
Geisha" is still running; in New York It
has endured three revivals at LJy's, in
Berlin and in Paris it has been success
fully produced, and only a few days ago
it commenced a season in Moscow. The
present representation Is a credit to the
Tivoli and to the town, and while another
run of seven wee-s is hardly to be ex
pected, a fortnight at least should be
profitable both to the Tivoli and its
patrons.
Alcazar.
Marshall would have no "false shame"
should he see the play as It was we
sented last night at the Alcazar. It was
bad enough to have the lines garbled
with bad grammar, without having
Wright Huntington try to bring about a
combination of his Bowery walk with an
English accent. As a rule, the company
at the Alcazar is fairly up to the play
presented, but in the present instance,
there is either a lack of study or of com
prehension. It is possible that as the
week grows older there will be a keener
appreciation of the parts. If so. Alcazar
goers may have enjoyment for the com
edy itself is well worth seeing, even at
this end of the century.
Orpheum.
The holdovers at the Orpheum are
strong favorites this week, and last night
they received most of the applause. The
Whitney brothers, in their musical novel
ties, were well received, but when they
introduced a new feature in the form of
a colored dancer the audience forgot the
music in the pleasure of watching the
poetry of motion. Joe and Nellie Doner
do a fancy sketch which is full of sur
prises, and which, barring a little rough
ness, is good Orpheum entertainment.
Morosco's.
"Saved From the Sea," a nautical melo
drama of sensational scenery and heroic
acting, was given with enthusiastic effect
last night at Morosco's.

"Shall We Forgive Her" was attended
by a rather small audience. Primrose

WASHINGTON. Feb. 28.âRepresenta
tive Loud appeared before the Committee
on Merchant Marine and Fisheries to-day
and urged that -vmerican registry be
granted the steamship Zealandia. Mr.
Loud called attention to the fact that
$180,000 had been expended on this vessel
since her construction, and that this enti
tled her to the privileges of registry. The
committee took the matter under advise
ment, and finally decided to report tue
bill "with the recommendation that it lie
on the table." _ -is is equivalent to a
postponement.

been written to members Â«>f the committee
opposing the bill, and these emanate from

a Canvass Among Represen
tative Men for Members
of the Committee of
Fifteen.
LET CALIFORNIA SHOW HER PRODUCTS.
SAN FRANCISCO; Feb. 28, 1898. (
To the City Editor of The Call: <
Encouraged by the magnanimous action of The Call, which gen- i
erously sacrificed the space of its columns in favor of an enterprise of '
public interest, I would like to add a few remarks to my previous sug- '
g^tlons on the subject of the Semi-Centennial Exposition, for the pur- i
; of arguing the most important points treated by Mayor Phelan (
at his preliminary meeting. Though I am a fervent admirer of his I
Honor, I must contest his suggestion to postpone from 1900 to 1901 the i
â¢v. tit which has already so many adherents, and will try briefly to â¢
demonstrate that there are no reasons to fear our competitor, "Paris i
World's Fair." The American continent is fifteen times larger than i
France and has double the inhabitants. '
Its industries both differ and compete with those of all Europe. i
Small cities like Milan, Turin, Brussels, Antwerp, Havre, Toulouse, i
Marseilles, Edinburgh, Liverpool and many others have at different i
periods, each one separately and through her own efforts, held sue- '
cessful expositions, all of them respectively showing their original '
products, their typical features, characterizing their own schools of Â»
arts and industries. Why should not, let me ask. the United States, or
even California alone, be able to show the increase and progress of its
manufacturing industry? Have we no attractions whatever in this
vast continent unless they are imported from the other side of the
ocean ? '
And supposing that French products should be so badly wanted
and should their attractions be of such a great importance so that
success depended on them, by soliciting the co-operation of our im
porter? of and dealers in fine arts couldn't California make as good a
display as can be expected from' the few, very few, European firms who
might answer to our invitation? '
As I stated once before, on account of the geographical position of
our State not one in a hundred Europeans would incur the enormous
expense connected with an exhibition for the sake of exhibiting here.
Mind. I do. not count among exhibits a show of cheap French jewelry
nor an ocarina or guitar player.
<'f such can be had more than wanted. At the Midwinter Fair I
represented about forty foreign concerns, and was well acquainted with
the majority of the exhibitors, and the result of their exhibit was any
thing but encouraging, fine climate and fresh air being not enough for
them. .
The Intent of this senTi-centennial show should be to bring this
State intn prominence and to increase its exportations, and such an
intent California will never reach by sending a vessel via the Horn to
Havre;, or Marseilles and loading it with the leavings and discarded rem
nants of the Paris Exposition, buying if necessary portions of old '
buildings and abandoned pavilions, just as under different circum- '
stances was the result of our Midwinter Fair, which, considering it i
was built tip at short notice and through the efforts of one man alone, i
nt.-l ail that a man can do. - (
JSut from the efforts of all the country, and the addition of our <
Government and State financial aid, California expects much more. i
It certainly would be more suitable and more considerate to our i
country's interest to have our own architects and artists to show i
something original and attractive, in keeping with our climate and i
style of architectural conceptions. i
The Paris Exposition I know conflicts with the few Eastern visitors
who, at the same rate, will give it the preference, but, exception made '
fur agricultural products, we cannot improve our commerce from
Eastern sources, as they already supply us with more than is desir
able, v.hil^ the southern republics and neighboring States and islands
would be mere likely to open fields for future trade with California.

The '.isuggv-stlnn made by Mayor Phe
lan at the meeting held an Friday to
â change the year from 1&00 to 1001 is
meeting with some opposition. It is
argued that the year originally pro
posed is the proper one by reason of
the fact that the fifty years of State
hood will have expired ml IK"}, and for.
sentimental reasons the exposition
should be held then. While that year
has any quantity of din-rents, there
are some mire conservative support
ers of the project who assert that
there are many arguments in favor of
holding the. exposition lit 190.1. How
ever, that would come as an .after con
siderattoii and could be easily settled
: by the committee of fifteen which the
Mayor will appoint and which will de
cide the question and any others that
may arise in the 'â¢-'*::.â  frosts of the
exhibition. It is not anticipated that
: any - trouble will ensue in the adoption.
of either year, as the deTerminatlon to

I have seen a number of others, as I
wish to weigh them carefully and
choose only those who are not found
wanting, and who are competent in
every respect. This will take some
time, for the canvass must of necessity
be thorough, and I may not be in a po
sition to announce the names of the
committee for two weeks at least, and
I will not give it out until the fifteen
have been selected. I will say that all
whom I have approached on the sub

position and are a unit on its advisa

committee there will be no difficulty ex
perienced in carrying out the plans to
a successful result, if the proper men
are chosen to manage it. and that is
why I am desirous to proceed carefully
and slowly, in order that failure will
not attach to the exposition."

ter;^ â  â  â  â¢, : '- : -
"Business ts steadily on the decline in
this city," said the merchant, "and un
less something is done in the way of
building up commercial relations with
th- outside world a crisis will not be
long in coming, I, place little faith, as
a rule, in the so-called expositions, such
as have been held in the past, but I
sincerely believe that if this great fair'
which The Call proposes to place be
fore the world in 1901 is managed in
the right way it will undoubtedly be of
untold value to the city and the State.
If you want to see the depression in
business affairs, take my establishment
as an example, or, in fact, -any other
large jewelry house in the city, and
compare the business done a few years
ago with that which is being done to
day; there is hardly, If any, compari
son. It is an undeniable fact that we
must have something to bolster up
business affairs or there will be a .ca
tastrophe in the business world whicb
will shake the city to its foundation.
What I say, is to go ahead with this
contemplated exposition as tt can't <
come too soon for the relief of the
State.
' "The idea of postponing the formal
opening until 1901 is a goc-d one for
many reasons: We can't hope or ex
pect people to stay at home while the
fair at Paris in 1900 is in progress.
Their desire will not be so much to see
the fair, probably, as to see the city.
"People say that this Klondike move
ment is going to be the salvation of ,
this city; but this expected salvation
is going to be so slight I am afraid that
it will have little or no influence on the
metropolis if it ever reaches it at all.
People, in consequence, should fortify
themselves against the delusion and
prepare something that will bea lasting
benefit to their interests. If the expo-*
sition succeeds in attracting people out
here many of them, I am sure, would i
be Induced to remain. I indorse The .
Call's project, and I hope that it will
meet with the concurrence of all the
merchants and business men of the
city." .
THE SAN FBAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAECH 1, 1898.
BATEMANS GET
AN EXTENSION
Given Until October 1 to
Finish the Hall of
Justice.
Supervisors Do Not Think
Them Responsible for
Delay.
Boxing Clubs Will Now Pay a
Fee of One Hundred
Dollars.
Bateman Bros., contractors for the
Hall of Justice, have obtained an ex
tension of time until October 1, In spite
of the opposition of Kearny-street
property-owners, who desired that the
job be taken out of their hands.
J. F. Sullivan appeared before the
board and stated on behalf of Bateman
Bros, that It was not the fault of the
firm that the structure had not beÂ°n
finished, but that the responsibility lay
with the contractor who had under
taken to clear the site of the old City
Hall.
George S. Shadburne opposed such
action in a lengthy speech, in which he
| called attention to the fact that prop
j erty interests, in the vicinity of the Hall
of Justice are being injured by the de
lay. He stated that it appeared to him
I that no efforts were being made to
I hurry the work.
Supervisor Rottanzi wanted to give
! the contractors thirty days, while Su
i pervisor Britt thought that under the
! circumstances the contractors should
I be given time even beyond October 1, if
â  necessary.
It was finally decided to grant the po
j tition, Supervisors Lackmann and Smith
! being the only ones who voted against
it on the final ballot.
Supervisor Sheehan's amendment to
! the boxing ordinance proposed by Su-
I pervisor Clinton went through without
| difficulty, and in future boxing clubs
j who can get permits from the Health
and Police Committee will be able to
give their exhibitions on the payment
of a $100 license fee.
The City and County Surveyor was
] authorized and ordered to designate the
j lines of the Balboa boulevard for the
[purpose of establishing a sewerage sys
! tern on the great drive.
The report of the Street Lights Com
i mittee shutting off the street lamps ten
nights in each month was adopted.
The Western Addition funeral direc
tors were given until July 1 to bury the
indigent dead fn the City Cemetery,
and an attorney for the Italian and
French societies asked thut the sanit;
j privileges be granted these o-rganiza
! tions. No action was taken on thia
i matter.
Mayor Phelan presented a communi
cation regarding the salaries paid in
the County Clerk's office, the closing
j paragraph of which was as follows:
I therefore recommend that the City
I and County Attorney be directed to in
; stitute suitable proceedings against either
i the Auditor or the Treasurer, or both,
and their bondsmen to recover moneys
paid as salaries during th. current tiscal
year to deputies of the County Clerk, ex
cept as authorized by the act of February
IS, I v mÂ». Such a course will nerve a doable
purposeâ First, if the suit be successful, it
j will be a check upon the wasteful extrav
agance of the County Clerk, who .spends
almost twice as much annually as did his
predecessors; and, secondly, by an appeal
to the Supreme Court a decision may be
' obtained from that triounal us to whether
j San Francisco will be exposed in the
I future to legislation so manifestly special
I in its character as that contained in the
acts of April 2, 1880, and February 14, IS9I

Grace PicKett and Lena Carillo Yearned to Leave a Troublesome
World at One Plunge.
GRACE Pickett, a blonde about 22
years of ago, and Lena Carillo, a
dashing brunette, who confesses
to having seen 23 years of sunshine and
storm, sought death in the waters of
the bay yesterday afternoon.
For some time pastthe twoyounggirls
have been boon companions; together
they lived and shared the uncertainties
of a "sporting life," and when Lena
finally becann- despondent and decided
to give up the struggle, Grace stoically
decided that even dt-ath would not part
them; every thine: had been evenly
shared, and if Lena was going to die
she should not die alone.
Lena is an uuusuaily pretty /girl, with
soft, black eyes and an abundant mass
uf jet black hair, which fell in soft,
wavy curls about the round,- childish
face as she lay in the little cot at the
Harbor Receiving Hospital and told her
storyâ the sad story of a wrecked and
ruined life. Her home is in Los Ange

Seventh to Eighthâ Property owners may pave,
by private contract, as Mayor's veto was made i.
les. and a year ago, becoming wearied
of the restraints of domestic life, she
was induced to run away with a friend,
who also wished to see a little of the
world. The twain proceeded in com
pany as far as Fresno, whf>re Lena was
deserted by her companion. Alone,
friendless and almost penniless she de-
cided to come on to San Francisco, and
see what the great metropolis c-f the
West had to offer. Here she met a
man whom she had known in her child
bood days at the old home. She ap
pealed to him for assistance, and he
readily agreed to help her. Instead of
aiding her, as he promised, the man in
whom the s:irl trusted cruelly wronged
and then deserted hor. There was ap
parently but one thing left for the un
fortunate girl thus wrecked and de
serted â a life on the streets.
She si xin drifted into the lower levels,
and there met Grace, who had been a
denizen of the unsavory quarter of the
city for about two years. The two be
came fast friends.
Leu trradually became more and
more despondent. Sunday night she
told her friend she had decided to get
away from the life she was leading in
the only way which appeared open to
herâ by ending her life. A little thing
uneer v misunderstanding.

like committing suicide did not fease
Grace for a moment, she at once as
sented, and furthermore decided to
make her exit from this mundane
sphere at the same time as her
friend.
_ The two then counted up their as
sets and found a balance of about $25
cash on hand. It would not do to go
out of the world and leave this behind,
so the two linked arms and proceeded
to purchase the most luscious kind of a
jag. In this, at least, Grace succeeded
beyond her utmost expectations â the
jag was a dream, and even a salt-wa- j
ter bath has not succeeded in totally
eradicating it. The two stayed out to
gether all night, and by noon of yester- i
day the cash had given out and there
was just enough left for ferriage to
Oakland. This was all right; nothing
was better than to let old Goat Island
view another tragedy, so they em
barked on the Encinal on her 1:45 trip
from this city. The girls paraded back
and forth on the boat apparently in
good spirits until about half the dis
tance to Goat Island had been trav
ersed, then they walked .out to the
stern of the boat and Grace, throwing
her hjat down on the deck, gathered up
her skirts and exclaimed, "Here's a go,
Lena," plunged into the water.
Lena was not long in following her
example, but a touch of old' Neptune
and a few mouthfuls of brine soon sat
isfied the girls, and they began to
scream lustily for help.
A lifeboat from the ferry was at once
launched, but before they could reach
the girls a launch from the United
States steamship Patterson, which hap
pened to be in the vicinity, had come
to the rescue, and the frightened and
screaming girls were dragged aboard it
and taken to the Harbor Receiving
Hospital. It is not likely that they will
suffer any serious consequences as a
result of their escapade, but Grace
deeply mourns the fate of her clothing
as she says "the water made the dye
all run." ,
After an hour or two In bed in a
warm room the girls became talkative,
but not repentant. Grace seemed to
glory in her experience, and paints her
self a heroine, while Lena is almost
sorry the attempt was not successful,
and threatens to end her life with gas
at the first opportunity.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top flg
tirÂ»s at .-tatlon indicate maximum temperature
for the days; those underneath it, if any, thÂ«
amount of rainfall, of melted snow In Inches
and hundredths during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, nr s-olld lines, connect points of equal .
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
eure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington: coast. When
the pressure is high In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
narked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idah.T, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer .we.ath.fr may be expected
In summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

of money rates In London and a notably easier >
one in New York. Call loans were ma,<!e as low

market from the start. Opening prices In July
were about lc higher than Saturday's ; closing,
ranging from 89% to 89% c; while May was %@%c
higher at $1 oS@l 03%. A temporary dip followed.
There was a good deal of. reni'-'-.K by people
who were satisfied with the profits shown in
the opening advance, and this selling sent the
price of July to 89c and May to $1 U2%<q 1 02,-..
Then- the real strength of the â¢ market was
shown. . 'As soon as the first pressure: of sell
ing was removed prices began to advance at
once, shorts, â  big and. little, coming Into the
market to cover their lint and for two hours
prices moved upward slowly but â  steadily. At â 
the end of that time May had advanced to
$1 04% and July to 90% c. This strength was
due' mostly to news from Liverpool. That
market was exceptionally strong, showing %<g>
%d advance at 1:30 p. m., later cables record-
Ing even better prices.: After advancing to
$1 O.">& lor May and WifcC for July the demand
was satisfied. During ; the last half hour or so
profit taking was indulged in sufficient 'volume
to send prices down to $1 04% for Slay and
59%4i80%c for July by closing time... 1 i

Wool: "Market is quiet at this date, with
values at the same quotable range as ' they
have been since the first of the year. A large
portion of .the wool carried, over from 1897 is
still on hand, much of it in a scoured state,
and all is being quite steadily hel<T. As to the
quantity and quality of the coming clip, it
is too ' early, to predict, but with favorable
weather and plenty of feed, the flocks of sheep

COFFEEâ C. E. Bickford's circular gives the
receipts at this port thus far this year at
23.453 bags, against 22.730 during the â  same
time last year. The sales from first haryls
were 18,680 bags, against 15,538. The stock on
hand March 1 is li.ISS bags, against 8446 last
year. The world's visible supply February 1
was 6.031.474 bags, * against 3,882.234 February 1,
1897. The circular says: Â» .
"Our last Review was : dated 17th Inst. The
early part of the period found business rather
quiet, but during the past three days the
demand has revived, and most of the sales
given below were consummated in this time.
As to quotations a decided drop has occurred
'n Salvadors. The ordinary current quality of
unwashed has gradually sold downward, under
pressure from holders, to Be, which is the
closing figure. Washed Coffees of every de
scription ' are also quotably lower, more
markedly those grading mere!" "good" or be
low. . The fancy styles being still in request
and not over abundant, have not been affected
to the same extent, although these, too, are
slightly easier. â  The New York market remains

NOTICE TO MARINERS.
Forecast of Wind and Weather in the North
Pacific Ocean for March.
Branch Hydrographic Office, San Francisco,
Cal., February 26, IS9B.
The following forecast of wind and weather
in the North Pacific Ocean for March has Just
been received from the Hydrogmphlc Office in
Washington:
The sub chari of isobars and isotherms for
March, which appear on the Pilot Chart, shows
an almost permanent high, with its center
about midway between the Hawaiian Islands
and the coast of California, but a little further
south and east than during February. One
effect of this silent shifting of the high will be
found in the limits of the trade winds being
somewhat farther south than during the pre
vious month. The general movement of the
wind will be found around this high with the
sun. and on the south side the trade winds will
be lound blowing with a decidedly northerly
slant in that portion of the ocean east of the
Hnwaiian Islands, while to the westward of
them they may 1 p expected to be more east
erly and at times east-southeasterly. Near
the coast within the northeast trade wind
limits Instead of northeasterly winds northerly
and northwesterly winds may be expected.
Just south of the Aleutian Islands is an al
most permanent low of considerable depth
as shown on the sub chart of isobars and iso
therms for this month. Between the low and
the high will be found a general movement of
the atmosphere from Asia to America, as evi
denced by the strong westerly and southwest
erly winds, and north of the thirty-fifth paral
lel frequent gales often accompanied by heavy
hail and snow squalls north of the fortieth par
allel may be expected.
During March frequent gales may be expected
in that part of the ocean ir. the vicinity of the
Juan de Fuca straits and east coast of Japan,
and frequent squalls may be expected In the
vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands.
Occasional spiral circulations, viz.. the cy
clonic (against the sun), with low barometer
anil the antlcyclonic (with the sun), with hiÃh
barometer, will be found moving in a general
easterly direction across the ocean. Generally
in front of the cyclonic area, or the low, the
weather Is damp, with thermometer rising and
barometer falling, while in front of the anti
cyc.Sonic circulation, or the high, it ts dry,
cooler, and the barometer rises The avenci
storm track traced on the pilot nf C Vh^se low?
the average path of the centers of these^ l o ]* B -
TjThoons are usually Infrequent during
March The NE monsoon on the SE coast or
Asia may be expected to continue to blow dur
'"fecasio^al^og will be found in that part of
thY ocean north of the forty-fifth parallel, and,
along the coast of the Un U? g "jj^qhES.

Mr. Upton denied any ; knowledge of

can't fool me. I know it all. You are
the biggest hypocrite in the county
like all the rest of the church gang." v
President Pringle â¢. called Brosnahan
to order, but it was of little use.
â¢ * The riot began when the Council was
about to adjourn. Some one in the crowd
yelled "Boodler Brosnahan." Brosnahan
was on his feet in a moment. His'lan
guage cannot be put in type, but it was
a succession of volleys of oaths, curses
and vile language that would have
â done credit to the Fish gang. . : :
President Pringle called him to order,
: but it was no use. Brosnahari kept it
v up while the crowd hooted and yelled
like tigers. 'â â ,â -:â . :,-â â "â¢â 
The language was of the vilest, and
President Pringle ordered Chief L"K.y<]
to put Brbsnahan out of the hall. The
Chief paid no attention, and when at
tempting to make Brosnahan sit down
he refused to do so and ordered the
Chief to leave him alone. Chief Lloyd
did so. ici . /â â '-â¢.â :': . -'â¢â  :'â¢.â¢:â¢ :
Three times did President Pringle or
der the Chief to put- Brosnahan out,
but the irresponsible Councilman defied
him. and Sergeant Peterson.* who was
also present, seemed power) i s<s to act.
"I fine you $10. Mr. Brosnahan," said
President Pringle, in a moment of
calm. :..â¢â â â .â â - â '.- ' : â â â¢'â  â â â  ._;â

. "Oh, shut up! It takes six votes to
collect that, and you. can't get 'em!"
was the retort. ; . :.
Finally Chief Lloyd restored tempo
rary order and the Council . was ad-
Journea. . . â â '.â  _
As the vote was being taken, Brosna
han turned to the crowd, and after
some vile appellations he said, "Yer
can't intimidate me; I'm not Wood
ward, and I never was in the army.
You are a lot of " but the rest of
Brosnahan's words are not printable.
Brosnahan made a motion to get his
gun and uproar prevailed which nobody
seemed able to restrain or queil. Chief
Lloyd attempted to keep the mob out
side the rail and was partially success
ful. ' :
But the crowd had not forgotten the
vile abuse hurled at them by Brosna- j
han because they objected to being
robbed by hi 3 vote of $125,000. They
waited at the entrance to the City Hall,
and when Brosnahan appeared it was
apparent that only with the greatest
care could he be taken through the j
streets safely to his home. Chief Lloyd ;
called all the available officers to his j
aid and the Councilman was escorted
to Hanifln's! saloon, where Chief Lloyd
kept sentry at the door while his men
tried in vain to disperse the mob.
"There's a lamp post!" shouted some- '
body. "Put a halter around him.
"My name's not Woodward Bood
ler" "Thief," were some of the loud
yells that were kept up. It was a
more serious crowd than that which
chased Woodward to shelter in the
City Prison last week. They tried to
night to carry out some of their
threats, and only the big body guard
with which Brbsnahan was surrounded
prevented it.
After a stay of a few minutes in the
saloon Brosnahan and his guard came
out and proceeded toward Broadway.
The mob followed, more violently in
clined than ..â¢v.-r, and largely increased
They surrounded the Councilman and
proceeded down Broadway to Eighth
and all the distance the mob howled
like demons. They made several at
tempts to reach their man, but were
pushed back by the police. As they
passed the Oakland Water Company's
office the sight of the place incited the
mob to fresh anger and the Chief
stretched his men across the street
and forbade any one to go on the block
after Brosnahan and his friends had
passed the corner.
Then Oakland witnessed a sight. A
short distance along Eighth street from
Broadway a city Councilman was pro
tected by a handful of policemen, while
he attempted to draw his gun and fre
quently repeated that he would like to
kill a few people and "was not Wood
ward."
At the end of the street, kept back by
a row of few officers was a yelling mob
of a thousand people, but they could
not be restrained, and a moment later
they were surrounding another saloon,
into which Brosnahan had been taken
by his friends.
While in there, Judge Frick and Fred
Mvi dock, Assistant Fire Chief, became
quarrelsome and some blows were
struck, and the sight of a fight excited I
the crowd. Mr. Murdock was bundled
out and followed the crowd that was
yelling after Brosnahan,
Finally Brosnahan was landed at his
home door, but he refused to go in. He
wanted to go uptown and shoot a few
people, and was very ugly to the offi
cers, but finally he was put inside.
When the crowd was satisfied that
there was. nothing more to yell at,
Frank Valerga addressed them and in
cidentally the Chief of Police. Valerga
berated the department and wanted to
know why Brosnahan had not b<_-en ar
rested "like any other drunken man."
Valerga stated that to-morrow he I
would swear out warrants against
Brosnahan for disturbing the peace
and several other breaches of the law.
And pom- Woodward â he was forgot- i
ten. He left the City Hall with hardly
a: jeer, hardly a hiss. Several men saw
him to his home, but one would have!
done. It was not Woodward's night.
The major is a remarkable man. He
dis-. usses his actions with aparentnon
chalance, but shows clearly that he is
between Mephistopheles and a very
deep sea. To return to the path of vir
tue would be worse condemnation and j
greater proof of the origin of the ex- J
tortionate water rate resolution than
the allied companions will allow. To
continue along the present line is to
court the indignation of fellow-citizens
arid soldiers for the rest of his term of
office, and yet, this unhappy condition
does not materially fease the major.
Politics is evidently a good thing for
Councilman Woodward. His appoint
ment' as Councilman changed his luck.
Twenty-four hours after his appoint
ment Councilman Woodward was in
clover. In the parlance of the street
he was fiush. Everybody knew that for
a couple of years at least the Major had
been playing in hard luck. Little by
little his belongings fell away from
him. The last uf the Major's belong
ings were held in pawn by a money
lender named B. F. Lewis, who reside 3
on Franklin street. The goods were
stored in a warehouse on Thirteenth
street. Bright and early last Saturday
morning the Major appeared at the
store with a cancellation of the chattel
mortgage and an order from Lewis for
the release of the goods, as the secur
ities had been satisfied.
The Major also made a purchase of
some furniture for which he paid fash
and in addition was sufficiently wealthy
to pay the arrears in storage. On
Washington's birthday the Major spent
his time moving into a new house of
more pretentious appearance than the
humble rooms he had occupied before
becoming a city official.

A MEDITERRANEAN SCOURGE.
Appearance of the Dread "Olive
Knot" in an Orchard Near
Merced.
BERKELEY, Feb. 28.â "olive knot."
a ' disease which has long made â ; havoc
with the olive orchards of the Mediter
ranean, has made, its appearance in Cali
fornia in the orchard of A. R. Gurr, near
Merced, and the local horticultural com
mission will resort to stringent measures*
either by '.uprooting, the orchard or ef
fectually quarantining â¢ it, to prevent it
from spreading its ravages after the man
ner of phylloxera and the San Jose scale.
F. T. Binlotti of the agricultural depart-,
ment of the university has just returned
from the afflicted, orchard, of: which he
made. a very careful examination. â¢â â¢â  â¢â  â 
The symptoms of the 'disease are. woody
excrescences upon the sap bark of the
limbs and small knots on the leaves and
twigs. At first '.the orchard produces
heavily, but the fruit is of a poor quality
and soon spoils in.- pickling.- : The over
bearing of the trees' soon causes them to
weaken and' grow sickly and finally die.
The olive knot, is a bacterial disease;
and the .similarity of the " bacillus' ofeae,
which causes it, to the bacillus tubercu
losis, causes the disease often to be -er
roneously called plant tuberculosis.. -For
tunately the Gurr orchard' is. 1 Quite/ iso

Deliberate Suicide of a
Honolulu Man at
Livermore.
Left His Wife and Child and
Ended His Life at the
Depot.
Was Being Treated for Sickness
arid Was Considered
Cured.
Oakland Office San Francisco Gall,
908 Broadway, Feb. 28.
T. C. Porter of Honolulu jumped de
liberately before a moving freight
train at Livermore to-day. His head
and shoulders were crushed and death
was instantaneous.
About six months ago Porter came
to the coast from Honolulu with his
wife and daughter, the latter a. girl
about five years of age. For some time
he had been suffering from ner
vous troubles and it was decided that
a trip to the coast might cure him. He
tame to Livermore four months ago
and has gradually been improving since
his arrival. He lived with his wife
and family at a sanitarium and for
?ome time went out with a nurse. As
he improved he went out alone, and
Mrs. Porter and the doctor believed
him just about cured.
This morning Porter went out for a
walk. He went to the depot and
watched a freight train for some min
utes. After it started he walked with
much deliberatoin to the track and lay
across the rail a few feet ahead of the
engine. The wheels passed over him
before anything could be done to save
him. â  â  "
The deceased has been in business in
Honolulu and ie a man of some
wealth. Ff>r two years he has been a
sufferer from extreme nervousness and
despondency, but seemed to be en
tirely cured recently and In a short
time would have left Livermore. Por
ter was about CIO years of age.

Miss Bessie Ellis Is Now
Mrs. William Henry
Cornell.
She Was Nearly Killed in a Street
car Accident in Oakland
in 1894.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Fob. 2S.
The marriage of Miss Bessie ML Ellis
and William Henry Cornell to-night was
a surprise to their many friends in this
; city. Miss Kllis is a pretty, modest young
â  ladY of Fruit vale and has been before the
I public owing to several serious accidents,
[ any of which might have been fatal.
Miss Ellis was on her way into this city
!on May 24. 1X94, when an axle of the
i Havwards car, on which she was riding.
! broke and a number of the passengers
â  were seriously Injured. Miss Eliis was
thrown heavily to the ground ant' her
! limbs and back injured. A year later she
I filed a suit for $20,000 damages, which is
I still pending. . .
The first time she was able to leave
; home she accompanied the family to
i Glenwood on July 4 to a picnic. The day
1 was pleasantly spent, and several friends
left her at the narrow-Kauge depot. She
had hardly walked throe blocks when a
spent bullet from a revolver struck her
> cheek, penetraMng to her mouth. This
i happened, near the Exposition building
| about 11 o'clock.
The police never secured any clew as to
â  who it was that fired the shot. Her
i friends hope that her lucky star, which
! prevented her from being killed in these
two accidents, may prove fortunate
â  enough in the future to keep her from
; meeting any more such occurrences.

Summer in Japan.
The first stops in the preparation of
Alir- Plielsen'a now opera will be tinc
tured with tin' sea salt and the ocean air.
As soon as- tlu> season is completed and
the ; Bostonians disbanded Miss Nielsen,
With a number of iriends, theatrical ami
social, will embark for Japan, where she
will spend her summer vacation.
But the trip is not to be one of pleasure
solely. While the idle moments will be
passed among the Geisha and hurrying
across the Occidental gardens in jinriit
shas, a great portion of the time will
be spent in familiarizing herself with the
tnusic of the new opera, in which she
will be the bright, particular star of all
the firmament. With Miss Nielsen will
be Eugene Cowles, Tom Williams. Miss
Cleary, Miss Hortense Nielsen and tha
prima donna's son. V
If Xeptune does not play havoc wit hi
the digestive organs of the sea sirens the
score of the new opera w-lil first ba
opened on the ocean wave. Cowles, who
is to be Nielsen's leading support, and
the prima donnaâ according to report
have several duets in the optra which
Torn Williams will float. Thene will bo
rehearsed and studied until perfected.
After a sojourn in the Mikado's empire
for a month or more the party will re
turn to thfs city find then proceed to New
York: :; There Nielsen am] Gowles will

FAVORITES
WERE BEATEN
Lightly Backed Joe Ull
ma.n Proved the Only
Winning Choice.
Odds On, Again a Warm. Fa
vorite, Easily Downed
by Bonita.
Bftnamrla Finally Captured a Purse.
XhÂ« Cuppy Going Suited Plan,
Whicli Won at Fair Odd*.
The cuppy going, together with the
low quality" of horses starting, played
havoc with the followers of form and
fipures at InÃleside yesterday. The
downfall of five of the first choices did
not entail any very big losses, as the
fcettins was extremely light. Specula
tors do not seem to fancy the cards of
fered by the kxal track and the attend
ance continue* below the average.
The best ones were scratched for the
first event of the clay, a seven-furlong
Belling affair, which left Captain Pier
sal to go to the post a 4 to 5 favorite.
He had some speed, but was easily
beaten through the stretch by the third
Choice, Velox, piloted by Conley. Wil
liam OB died away in the run home,
finishing a poor third.
The I'orrigan entry Ach was a pro
jiounced favorite for the two-year-old
scramble, but Clayton was unable to
land him inside the money. Primavera.
a 15 to 1 shot, with Hennessy in the
saddle, was in front most of the route,
and won easily from Master Buck, the
second choice, Ocprona, left at the
post on Saturday, finished in the show.
Moringa, the 9 to 5 favorite for the
third event over sewn furlongs, was
pounds the best, but little Devin went
to pieces when the bend for the wire
â¢was reached, and the Sobranf? geld
ing once more finished third. Making
his run the last part, Clawson came
fast with Benamela, and driving hard,
downed Veragua a short head. The
winner went to the post at odds of 3
to 1.
Ed Corrigan's cripple Joe UHman
opened favorite in the mile selling run,
but did not seem to find much favor,
and drifted back in the betting from
even money to 8 tt; r>. With Clayton in
the saddle, he took the lead from
Charles A when half the distance had
been covered and won eased up.
<"harles A secured the place from Haz
ard, which horse sulked most of the
route.
It looked as though Plan, the unre
liable plater from "Butch" Fisher's
suable, finally struck the go-ing he likes.
<J"inK to the post in the mile and a six
teenth at odds of 5 to 1, with the stable
money held aloof, he made the running
almost from the start, and at the wire
led Gotobed out by half a length. The
favorite away none too well,
cliil no-t like the mud and would not ex

The big chestnut Odds On was again
made a hot favorite, opening In the bet

played in on Bonita, and Fink's filly
led from start to finish, winning in a
canter. Melvin Burnham was the only
other starter.

INTO THE STREET
Pitiful Plight of Mrs. Maria
Parente and Her Six
Helpless Babes.
Turned Out of the Home She and
Her Murdered Husband Had
Been Induced to Sign Away
Under Misapprehension.
"Mother of God, hear me' Wilt thou
permit these fiends to drive my father
less babes shelterless into the streets?
Cunst thou Bee these Innocent ones '!-â â -
Bpolled of the home that was all their
murdered father left them? Hast thou
no memory of the wanderings of thine
own son. the little Christ child thou
gayest that those who came after him
mieht be spared? Holy mother, and
thouj dear Jesus, I beseech you to give
to me and mine thy divine love; for
get. <>, mother, my harsh words, and j
remember only my sufferings; do with ;
me as you will, but cast not my help- j
]> 38 little ones into the night, with i
naught to shield them from cold and
hunger! Dear Christ, what has been my
Bin that this punishment should be j
meted out to me and mine? Is it so ,
Â£r<-'at that thou cannot forgive and save '
us from this desjfKriler?"
Like a torrent the burning words
1 from the frantic mother's lips. ;
Not for herself did she mind, but the j
nobs of her little brood drove her to
distraction, and now the end had come.
For ilays she had stiMd guaxd at the j
door of her little home driving off the
officers of the law who came to wrench
It from her, but the unequal contest
could not be waged forever; her ene
mies had triumphed, and now ci/wering
in a corner the frenzied mother, when
all else had failed, poured forth her
grief, not to the heedless ears of man,
but to the divine power she had been
taught since infancy to put her trust in.
Poor, friendless, heart-broken Maria
Parente. Left alone but little more
than a year ago to battle for herself
and six little ones with only a few, who,
like herself, had journeyed from their
loved Italia to the land of promise, with
whom she could converse, it is not to
be wondered that she looked upon all
but her own people as enemies, and
called down the wrath of heaven upon I
the heads of the pitying law officers I
who had come to do the bidding of a
court <>f justke and drive her from the
little house she believed to be her own.
Such a scene is sometimes read about !
but seldom witnessed in real life, and !
certainly the half-score of Sheriff's !
deputies, policemen, reporters and syra- â¢
pathizing friends of the hapless woman J
nÂ»-vcr want to see it re-enacted. Last \
August Mrs. Parente was told in Judge
Hebbard'a court that her home was '
given to another â to Michele Tano, who i
claimed to have purchased it from the j
:n's husband â but she had lived on
in undisturbed possession until last
Saturday, when a deputy sheriff rapped i
at the door of No. 7 Vincent Place, j
away up on the slope of Telegraph Hill,
and told the woman that she must va- â¢
cate. Instantly all the fire that courses >
through the veins of her people was j
fanned into a blaze, and seizing a
hatchet the infuriated mother vowed to
defend her home against all the min
ions of the law that could be marshaled â 
against her. Th>; deputy, being a man
of peace, discreetly retreated, leaving j
her mistress of the situation for the
time being.
But yesterday miming the assault |
on the Amazon's stronghold was . re- |
newcd with an increased force, only !
to again be driven back by the vigilant ;
mother, who. realizing that her babes !
were to be driven into the street, had
edded to the armament of her fortress;
ny resurrecting an old-fashioned re- j
v.olver and gun that had belonged to .;
her husband, and when her assailants j
again appeared she flourished her
we,apons so menacingly that they were j
grlad to draw off and formulate a new
plan of campaign.
And who shall blame this poor child '
of the South for struggling to save a
shelter for her children? Ignorant of
the ways of the people in whose land i
she had taken up her abode, she be- j
lieyed. whether rightly remains to be j
ascertained, that she was the victim ;
of a bold outrage, perpetrated under
sanction of the law, and go she did
â what seemed to her only right â fought
off the men who sought to drive herself
and babes into the street.
After the repulse of Saturday, Mrs.
Parente sought to enlist the sympa- i
thies of the Italian Consul in her be- ]
half, and again yeplerjSay she tried to j
reach him. but repeated visits failed j
to. find him at his office, and the poor
woman returned home yesterday after- â 
noon to find the Sheriff's forces prepar
ing for another attack. .: .: '
Such n stnrm of protests, mingled i
"with pleadings and denunciations, as
she poured forth. Then rushing into i
an inner room she seized her hatchet |
and placed It under the. chair she occu
pied. Next she drew frorri under the
pillow on her bed the ancient revolver
and thrust it into her dress pocket.
drping to the window she looked up and
down the street and seeing none of her
enemies began to tell of her troubles
to the two <>r three women who had
stayed at the house during her absence
and to the newspaper men. Not a tear
dimmed the great dark eyes that
glowed like living coals as the poor
woman gradually lashed herself into
a frenzy as she recounted her wrongs. !
Louder rang her voice, until her over- j
wrought feelings gave way. and with j
a half sob, half shriek, she seized the

youngest bofn from the arms of the old
crone who had been; vainly endeavor
ing to hush its wailing arid clasping it
to her breast rained a shower of
caresses upon It.
As told by herself through the me
dium "f a pretty little woman, who .
acted as interpreter. Mrs. Parente's
story is of irmre than ordinary pathos.
Scarcely thirty-five years old she is the
mother of nine children; three of whom
died in infancy, while the oldest of the;
six who are living is a girl eleven years
of age. though she looks scarce half
that, an injury to her spine received
when she was an infant having blight
ed her growth and caused a larpe

An autopsy {disclosed the fact that he
had died from the effects of sulphuric
&C?cl. and that his tongue, mouth, stom
ach and liver were.. terribly burned by
the acid. All this is substantiated by
the records of the Coroner's office, and
on the margin ;of : the record appears
this significant memorandum, written
by the Coroner: "Queer transaction of
property in this case. . See testimony."
;: Mrs. Parente. continuing her story;
said â¢ that a ; year : before her husband's
death, after filing a homestead on the
property, they . gave the : . papers to
Michele who was : to try to sell
It for them, as they wanted to go back
to .Italy; to live. â  After her husband
died Tano . and Attorney â¢; Rossi . came to
her and told her to sign another paper,
as the ; paper, she ; signed in filing the
lomesteud was not good. She could not
read English, hut : trusting the lawyer,
she made her mark where told to. Taho
was to deliver the papers to her, but
never did .â¢! so, and when : he set up a
claim to the. property she began suit to
recover possession. Tano produced a
deed; and last August Judge Helibard
gave judgment in Tano's favor. . Since
Parente died the woman has retained
possession of the premises, and has
managed to partly support herself and
children by working out, but one of the
Italian societies has frequently come to .
her aid. She has been unable to rent
the upper part of the house, and a short
time ago she invited a. country woman
and her children to take up their :
abode in the vacant rooms until, they
could provide themselves with a homo.
As the brave little woman was con
cluding her sad life story. Deputy Sher
iffs Gallar.d, Apple, Tracy, Deagen,
O'Byrne and Brow, supported by two
police officers, again approached the
house, and succeeded in gaining an en
trance into the middle room in which a
comfortable bed and a tiny crib were
about the only articles of furniture.. In
fact the fact the . furnishings of all
three rooms were the scantiest, and be
spoke dire poverty. At sight of
the officers the woman â¢ again
became intensely excited and strove
desperately to get some weapon to'de
fend her home but the watchful offi
cers disarmed her, and were " careful
that she did no harm. Deputy Galland

by Judge BelcLer last Friday must.be.
carried out, and that she could seek re
dress in the courts, but the woman was
beside herself. She attempted to plead
for her children in English, but the
words came haltingly, and . launching
into her mother tongue she first begged,
then stormed until half maddened she
rushed to the bed and tearing from the
wall a cheap print :of Mary, and
the infant Savior; she .dashed, it on

â  stationed a few blocks from the scene j

was asked about the eviction, but all I
he would say was: "The property is j

In this conviction a portion of the j
testimony given before the Coroner'? j

| Tano, Palo and Mrs. Parente will be ,

(By InterprptPr Cuneo.)
Witness (through interpreter): My hus
band said; that he' was always work

the property, for -$1900; â¢ This gentleman
(Michele Tano) stated to me that if he
heard ; anybody that -wanted to buy the
property he' would let. me know.. We had
trouble, on .' the children's â account;., and
sometimes, my husband would whip me;
but after that, everything' was all right.

A.â l don't steal nothing. Mr. Rossi,
the attorney told me that after the pa
pers wouLd be registereil he . would send
hie the papers, but he never brought
them, so I asked Mr. Rossi for the pa
pers, and he said Mr. Tano had them.
I signed that document with the inten
tion that the property should be half
mine and &%tf belonging- to my husband.
I never knew of anything else. ..
By Coroner to Juryâ This paper tp
ferred to in the testimony was recorded
on the 2ftth day of DeeeiTiber, 1595. where
it was filed as a homestead. This paper

mony> on the 2:;<] day of October, 1836. In
consideration of $1Q in sold coinâ for JlO
consideration. go\ft -coin, gives the prop

And this is the basis of Michele Tano's
claim to that poor widÂ«>w"s homestead.
Although the Coroner's jury found
that Parente carpe to his death at the
hands of Louis Palo, that individual
is still unpuriish^d. and only a short
time aso the police were summoned to
7 Vincent place to prot<-et Mrs. Parente
from Palo, who had come upon her in
the dark for n o good purpose.

[, , Straits. ' ... .'â ::.'-.
Rausch street was treated to an ex- !
hibition of the majesty of the law yes- j
terday, when deputy sheriffs took the
furniture from the house of Mrs. Ida \
Parisien and left her and her four chil- ;
dren but their clothes and the floors j
and walls. j
The furniture was mortgaged for $80 j
a year ago, and although Mrs. Parisien j
has kept the interest paid, the mort-j
gagor, .'a .man named Backor, she said, :
came to. her last Friday and demanded ;
his principal. She said she could not j
pay it and he threatened to come the
next day arid take the furniture. He
did not come Saturday, but early yes
terday morning he came with some !
deputy sheriffs and they stripped the
house clean.
Mrs. Parisien asked the men to leave
her at least one bed; but they told her
she could sleep on the floor. Then she .
asked them to leave the stove, but they
said they would for $4, and as she could
not pay it that went. too. â ;
The mortgage drew nearly 5 per cent
a month, and incidental expenses had
run it up to $120. When the $80 was
originally borrowed "expenses" finally
brought it down to $65, and noty\ after
paying nearly $fio in Interest, Mrs. Par
isien owes half again as much as she
had borrowed:. : : ; :
Mrs. Pansien's husband, who is an
ex-letter carrier, left her at the begin
ning of this month, but she says he
never did anything 1 to. help her anyway,
so his absence is no additional Joss.
Now Mrs. Parisien is looking for
work, for she has but little money, and
all she can get is earned by her two
elder children. 12 and 13 years of age.
Sh,e hopes tn secure a position some
where to sew or do housework, and
then to find another little house where
she can start again. Last night there
was r.o food in the house and $2 repre- .
sent eft &11 the money the woman pos
sessfed. The family is in; A most pov
erty-stricken condition.
THEY DISCUSSED"
POLICE MATTERS.
Charter - Framers Unable to Agree
on That Branch of the
Government.
The matter of settling on the manner
In which the Police Department is to he
managed under the proposed new charter:
is evidently not easy of accomplishment. ,
The ehjarter-framers have decided on two '
occasions that the Chief of Police should ,
be a member of the Police Commission
and then rescinded that action. They are
now as far at sea as before.
When the convent'on met last night the
subject of the Police Department was
again taken up for consideration. D. V.
Kelly appeared before the members and
argued that the Chief of Police should be
a member of the commission.
A lengthy dismission followed, and there
was a great diversity of opinion ex
pressed. It was finally decided to refer
the matter back to the Fire and Police
Committee, with instructions that should
that body decide to recommend that the
Chief of Police be one of the commission
the chapter relating to the management
of the Fire Department be so amended as
to make the chief of that organization
a member of the Fire Commission.
The convention uecided to empower the
Police Commission to appoint one police
man for every 500 inhabitants; one cap
tain of police for each 100 officers; one
lieutenant for each SO officers and all ser
geants and lieutenants deemed necessary
for the proper government of the depart
ment. The Chief of Police will be. author
ized to select twenty-five members of the
force to act as detectives, subject to re
tirement to the ranks whenever, in the
opinion of the Chief, such change shall
be deemed proper and for the best in
terests of the department.
The Freeholders will meet again to
night to discuss provisions for the man
agement of the police pension fund.

-An unusually daring robbery took
place early last night in the cigar. store
of N. L. Wandell, at 1133% Mission
street.
Mr. Wandell, who is also financial
secretary of Carpenters" â  Union No. 22.
usually keeps the funds of the union in
a canvas sack und.-r the counter. Last |
night a stranger entered the store and !
called for a cigar, laying a nickel on ;
the counter in payment. He turned
around, lit the cigrir and turned to go
out of the store. As he was about to
pass out he stopped as though he had
forgotten something, walked slowly
back, and taking a dollar-piece from
his pocket asked Mr. Wandell if he
could give him two halves foi It.
To oblige the man, Wandell took out
the canvas sack, containing about $15
which he had collected for dues from
members of the union during the even
ing, lie placed the sack on the counter,
and was about to open it when the
stranger suddenly pulled it out of his
hand and started (nit of the store with
Waiidell and a half-dozen men who had
been sitting in the back of the store in
he it pursuit.
Either carpenters are not good sprin
ters or the thief was unusually light
footed as well as light-fingered, and
the race was a. short one. The man
sped up Mission street, darted down
Eighth, and mysteriously disappeared
down one of the darker side, streets,
and was soon lost to his pursuers. The :
men returned to Wandell's store badly \
u-iwlKl, and began congratulating one |
anothe â¢ that the marauder had not
pulled a gun and finished the race for
at least one of them.
Wan dell yesterday received a check
for $105, but neglected to have it cash
ed. Had he done so, it would have
be h in the sack with the rest of the
money, and his advice to all now is to
"never do to-r T av what can be put off
until to-morrow, or you'll come out
loser every time."
The man is a complete stranger to all
who /witnessed the theft, but It is
thought he must have familiarized
himself with Wandell's methods in
some way, or he would have not known
of the existence of the money sack. It
is also suspected that he knew some
thing of the check for $100, and expect
ed to make a lare^r haul. The matter
was reported to the police, and detec
tives Will be r*ut on the case.
