VOLUME LXXXIV.-3S T O. 182.
SPAIN CONSENTS TO CEDE
COLONIAL POSSESSIONS
YIELDS TO EVERY
DEMAND BY THE
UNITED STATES
Accepts t\)e Offer of Twer>ty Mil
lions of Dollars for the
Philippines.
Also Relinquisbes Cuba, Porto Rico and Guam,
and Now the Peace Treaty Will Be
Concluded.
PARIS, Nov. 28.â Spain has
accepted the United States'
offer of $20,000,000, and at
a joint session of the peace com
missions this afternoon consent
ed without condition to relin
quish Cuba and to cede Porto
Rica, ' Guam and the Philippine
Islands.
The document presenting this
acceptance contained only 300
words. It opened with a refer
ence to the final terms of the
United States, and said that the
Spanish Commissioners, after
having taken cognizance of the
terms proposed by the Ameri
cans, replied that their Govern
ment had tried to give as equit
able an answer as possible, but
that they were not prepared to
commit their Government to the
acceptance of principles embod
ied in the argument. "Spain re
jects these principles," the note
continues, "as she has always re
jected them."
Basing her attitude upon the
justice of her cause, the note
then says, she still adheres to
these principles, "which she has
heretofore invariably formu
lated."
However, the note, adds, in
her desire for peace she has gone
so far as to propose certain com
promises, which the Americans
have always rejected. She has
also attempted, it is further as
serted, to submit to arbitration
some of the material particulars
upon which the two Govern
ments differed. These proposals
for arbitration, it isÂ« added, the
Americans had equally rejected.
These allegations in Spain's re
ply as to attempted arbitration
refer to. her proposal to arbitrate
the construction of the third ar
ticle of the protocol, and also to
submit the Spanish colonial debt
of Cuba and the Philippines to
arbitration. The last proposition
has been made in a written com
munication. Since its present.'
tion. and in return for such arbi
tration, Spain offered to cede the
territory in dispute. The Ameri
cans refused both propositions
for arbitration.
- Spain's reply to-day in sub
stance- continued by declaring
that the United States has offer
ed as a kind of compensation to
Spain something- very inadequate
to the 'sacrifices the latter conn
try makes at this moment, and
she feels that the United States'
proposals cannot be considered
just and equitable.
Spain has, however, exhausted
all the resources of diplomacy in
an attempt to justify her attitude.
Seeing that an acceptance of the
proposal made to Spain is a nec
essary condition to a continuance
of negotiations, and seeing that
the resources of Spain are not
such as to enable her to re-enter
upon war. she is prepared, in her
desire to avoid bloodshed, and
from considerations of humanity
and patriotism, to submit to the
conditions of the conquering na

tion, however harsh they may be.
She is therefore ready to accept
the proposals of the American
Commission as presented at the
last sitting.
The reading and tl.e transla
tion of the document occupied
less than five minutes. At the
conclusion of the # translation the
Commissioners empowered Sen
or Ojeda, secretary of the Span
ish Commission, and Secretary
Moore of the American Commis
sion to draw up articles which
are to embody the relinquish-
ment of Cuba by Spain and the
cession of Porto Rico and the
Philippines. These articles, which
may be considered as constitut
ing the conditions of peace, will
be ready for submission on Wed
nesday.
A great deal of interest was
taken in to-day's meeting. The
two commissions arrived at the
Foreign Office in carriages in the
rain almost simultaneously, and
repairing to the conference room
immediately opened the only
business before them. President

COMMERCIAL CONDITIONS
WILL NOT BE OVERLOOKED
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â 1t is the
impression at the State Department in
the absence of anything save press re
ports of the proceedings at Paris to-
day that the Commission's work is now
near an end and that about two weeks'
time will suffice to close It up. This
idea is hased on the belief that instead
of undertaking to arrange the several
matters yet to be settled in the treaty
of peace, a general clause will be placed
in the treaty, binding each of the par
ties to begin negotiations in the near
future upon these subjects. Such
a clause ol necessity must be very
carefully drawn In order to insure
the United States a resumption of
commercial relations with Spain on

SCORES OF SHIPS
WRECKED OFF NEW
ENGLAND'S COAST
Appalling Loss of Life in the
Gale of Sunday on the
Atlantic Seaboard.
On Every Shoal and Reef in Boston Harbor
Stranded Craft Are at the Mercy of
the Waves.
BOSTON, Nov. 28.â 1t is
known definitely to-night
that more than seventy lives
have been lost in the wrecks of
tugs, schooners and coal barges
during the storm of Saturday
night and Sunday morning, and
if the steamer Portland also is
lost, as now seems possible, the
list of casualties will rise to 140,
with over 100 vessels of all de
scriptions ashore, two score of
them total wrecks and an un
known number probably beneath
the waves of Massachusetts Bay.
There is scarcely a bay, harbor
or inlet from the Penobscot to
New London that has not on its
shores the bones of some craft,
while all along Massachusetts
Bay, and especially Boston har
bor, the beaches are piled high
with the wreckage of schooners
and coal barges. The record, al
though hourly lengthening, is
still incomplete, for that ocean
graveyard of Cape Cod is still to
be heard from.
The annoyance and inconven
ience of the railroad and street
car embargo, covering the whole
of S6uthern New England, sank
into insignificance before the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
story of destruction wrought by
wind and wave, yet it will; be
many a day before the full im
port of the disaster is known or
even realized.
The islands of Boston harbor
are, without exception, strewn
with wrecks and wreckage. No
less than twenty-nine vessels are
ashore at Gloucester. Over
twenty in the supposed safe har
bor of Vineyard Haven parted
their anchor chains yesterday
and are high and dry on the
beach. Nantasket Beach saw two
schooners and a coal bafgie dash
to pieces on its sands; the rocks
of Cohasset claimed a staunch
fisherman; Scituate, a well
known pilot boat; Manchester, a
down-east lumberman, while one
tug and three barges known to
have been between Cape Cod and
Boston are unaccounted for and
probably are lost. The' upper har
bors of Boston, Plymouth, Salem,
Portsmouth, Portland and other
,>laces where vessels were sup
posed to be comparatively safe,
were the scenes of numerous col
lisions between the ships and the
wharves.
Every life-saving crew per
formed deeds of heroism in res
cuing crews from stranded ves
sels, and tug boat captains risked
life and property in their en
deavor to save life.
Not until daylight this morning
did the awful havoc by the storm
In Boston harbor and vicinity be
come appparent. Not since 1852 has
a storm caused such destruction
of property and loss of life so near the
city. The tugs that started early to
day to explore the harbor and offer as
sistance where it was needed found a
condition almost unprecedented in the
marine history of Boston. On every
shoal and reef in the harbor was some
wrecked craft, over which a wild sea
still dashed, carrying the vessel higher
up on the shore or slowly grinding it
to fragments. Many vi recks were cov
ered with ice, and this and the fact
that a terrific sea was running made it
impossible to learn their names.
The raging waters also prevented any
attempt to recover bodies known to be
in some of the wrecks, and it is prob
able that it will be several days before
a complete list of those lost can be ob
tained.
At Hull Beach, where two barges and
two schooners went ashore, more than
a dozen bodies were visible In the surf,
but it was impossible to get at them.
At Shag Rocks, between Boston Light
and the Brewsters, where the schoon
er Calvin F. Baker was ashore, two
sailors were taken from the rigging by
the lifesavers, both nearly exhausted,
and the body of another was recovered.
Three men from this vessel were
drowned, but their bodies could not be
found.
Among the tuga which started down
the harbor as soon as daylierht came
was the police-boat Guardian, which
last night was caught in the thick
weather off Deer Island, while endeav
oring to ascertain the meaning of dis
tress signals flying from the lighthouse.
She made for the tiny beacon which
marks the inner harbor channel again
this morning, and with a tossing sea
and strong Incoming tide, tried to an
swer signals. Finally it was learned
that the lighthouse had no fresh water,
for the heavy seas had broken in the
bulkheads and spoiled the water stored
there. There were five men in the
lighthouse. The two boats which usu
ally hang from the davits had been
splintered by the force of the waves and
the sea was dashing over the lighthouse
with such force that there was little
hope of reachin- It.
Beyond Deer Island lies the big Wil
son liner Ohio, and the steamer C. A.
White of Taunton, ashore on Spec
tacle Island. It is a matter of surprise
to harbor pilots how the Ohio reached
her present berth. She stands up bold
ly, without the semblance of a list, on2
a hard, gravel bottom, in water which
at flood tide this morning hardly came
to the level of the propeller shaft. That
she should be in such shallow water is
due to the fact that the tide in which
she went ashore was fourteen feet
above the usual flood tide. With her
powerful screw churning the mud and
several powerful tugs straining at
lia-wsers over her stern at flood tide to
day there was no tremor of the vessel
toward the open water.
According to tome oÂ£ the wrecking
masters, the only way to save the liner
LÂ«. by dredging a channel from the Ohio
to deep water, but even this must be
done quickly, us another gale would
do incalculable damage.
The White evidently lies on rocks.
and- while she could be pulled into deep
writer, her cargo would scarcely keep
h< r utloat.
Leaving Spectacle Island astern, a
sorry sight is presented by the three
masted schooner Calvin F. Baker, on
Shag Rock, midway between Boston
Light and the Brewsters, where the
deep-sea surges roll in ami half bury
the craft, which is fast going to pieces.
The 'mainmast has been whipped out
and hangs dangling over the side, sup
ported by the top hamper of the other
masts.
From this wreck the two mates were
taken off by Captain James and his
crew, from across the bay at Hull. It
wa* daybreak when the Baker was
Been and the lifeboat was sent on its
mission. The pull was a Long one and
finally, when the wreck was reached,
three bodies were seen lashed aloft. Two
oi" them were secured and life was
found in them, but the other had beil
frozen stiff to his lashings. The sur
vivors and the body were taken to
Hull.
It was on the little Btretcn of beach
at Hull, just behind the Hotel Pember
ton. that the tragedies occurred. The
old salts of Hull say that in fierceness
storm equaled that of 1852, except
that while the sea did not run so high
the- wind was stronger.
In the- fury of the etorm yesterday
two hig-n.-wly built barges of the Con
solidated Coal Company â Nos. l and 4â
were dashed to bits in an instant.
On the shon s stood scores of men who
wefre ready to risk their lives to save
who were <>n many of the V
In the offing, driving to destruction.
. b of the life-saving crew
was there with his nun. He said the
wind blew so fiercely that not men
enough could find room in the boat to
row against the wind. Out of the driven
snow came the dim outlines of a barge,
with the fdnns of five men discernible
on the deckhouse. With a mighty crash
a* ft came down on a receding wave,
Barge N0...l Struck the shun-, only to
hie and then melt into fragments
which the waves in another minute cast
upon the shore.
In that instant five men escaped the
Impending death, for as the barge split
in twain the deckhouse slid off toward
the shore into the surf and at the same
tirrje men' on shore with lines about
them rushed into the water and pulled
cut the sailors. A moment later Barge
No. -4 came ashore and was ground >ip
by the waves, but nothing was seen of
its crew.
n after this other wreckage came
ashore, and this morning it was B< en
that both the Abel ('. Babeuek and the
Pamviel W, Tilden had been wrecked.
No ftfgn of the crew of either vessel was
found.'
Another terrible scene was that at
Thompsons Island, where the city's re
gchool is Bituated. Against the
wharf were. driven four down East ves
each <jf which, at the time the
storm' broke, was anchored miles away,
and each a long way from the others.
An idea of the force of the wind is
shown in this instance, for after drift
ing a<"r<>ss the bay one after another
hr"Ut:lit lip against the pier, one being
driwn -entirely out "f the water. The
craft are the Virginia, ( ,f which barely
a vestige is left; the Watchman, the
Feraphine and the Fred Emerson. The
last three are* in one great heap of tim
ber and rigging mixed with debris from
the Virginia. Two lives were lost from
the latter craft. William B. Stanley,
thÂ£ captain's son, was dashed ashore
and resuscitated.
Of the other wreckage the most sin
gular is that of the tug Tamaqua, on
Ralnsforda Island. She â  has gone
straight on against a promontory of
raeka, and there seems little chance of
getting her off. Her consort, a Heading
b&rgo, was easily floated this afternoon.
Other evidonces of the storm art- to
be found on every headland and in
nearly every cove, for numberless and
nameless wrecks, all snow and sleet
covered, are piled up there. It will be
some time before all the vessels which
fared ill on Sunday can be accounted
for, and some perhxips never will be, so
thoroughly have the wind and the
wavts dojie their work.
STEAMSHIP ASHORE

DULUTH, Minn., Nov.- 28. â The
steamer Harlem of the Western Tran
sit Line is ashore on the south side of
Isle Royale, near Menagerie Light, in
nearly the same spot where the Cen

is in *& exposed position and is- thought
to be leaking. The news was brought

CREWS OF SEVERAL
VESSELS MISSING
SCTTUATE, Mass., Nov. 28.â The big
pilot-boat Columbia of Boston is piled
up on top of t a wrecf^d cottage, broad
side on, dismasted and a total wreck
on the beach here. It is feared that all
on board were lost. One body, that of a
man apparently 30 years old, was found
in the hold, but a diligent search failed
to produce any others.
It is thought that the craft beached
about noon, though none of the beach
residents saw her strike. She was in
charge of Boatkeeper Henry Peterson,
with a crew of three men before the
mast and a steward, and had taken the
outer station early last week with sev
eral pilots on board. Peterson was re
turning to this port with the Columbia
after putting Captain Abbott aboard
the Ohio, which dragged ashore on
Spectacle Island.
Mis. Wilbur of Rainham was
drowned here on Sunday while trying
to escape from her summer cottage.
Her body was washed ashore and
picked up in the street.
The l!fe-saving crew reports the
wreck of a large baree at Ahumacock
Beach. It is thought to be the derelict
L. Tenney of Boston. No trace of the
crew has been found.
Sixty cottages at Sand Hill were to
tally destroyed.
A vessel Â« ith one mast standing was
sighted ashore at the Brant dock.
WERE LOST WITH THE
BERTHA A. GROSS
SAI^EM, Mass., Nov. 28.â Two mem
bers of the crew of the schooner Bertha
A. Gross, from Deer Isle, Maine, were
rescued from House Island, off Man
chester, to-day, nearly dead, having
been without shelter or food for thirty
hours. From them it was learned that
the schooner was lost on the rocks near
Fresh Island Saturday at midnight,
and Captain Wallace Thursuon, aged
70 years, arid his son John perished.
The schooner carried 260 tons of
stone. She encountered the gale off
Ann Saturday evening and finally
struck kii the rocks near Fresh Island,
which is some distance off Manchester.
She was soon a total wreck. The
other members of the crew, Neil Mc-
Donald and Hezekiah Robbins, man
aged to reach shore on House Island.
This is a barren place with no shelter
and the Bhipwrecked men were forced
to remain there until help reached
them this morning.
Persons on shore saw the sailors and
put off in boats. Both McDonald and
Robbins were nearly dead from ex
posure and hunger. McDonald's feet
were frozen and he is in a critical con
dition.
THREE VESSELS ARE
ASHORE NEAR QUINCY
QTIINCT. Mass., Nov. 28.â The three
master steamer Ayhich went ashore
near the National Sailors' Home here
yesterday is the John J. Hill, bound for
| Hillsbor..-, N. 8., from New York. She
was anchored in the Nantucket Roads
when the . storm struck her. She
dragged her anchors and was gradu
ally driven before the terrrific gale
until she struck the shore. The steamer
j is now high on land and ia apparentiy
i not damaged.
The John J. Hill was engaged in the
i plaster trade. She registered 947 tons
was built in 1592 at Marine City,
Mich. She hails from Port Huron,
i Mich. The crew are safe.
The two-masted BChooner Ella F.
Crowell, from Thomaston, Me., Captain
J. W. Thomas, is a total wreck on
I Veazies Rock in Quincy Bay. The
crew escaped.
The schooner Mary Rodgers went
1 ashore at Mosquito Woods and is high
j and dry.
ENTIRE FLEET OF
VESSELS DESTROYED
VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass., Nov.
28. â The fierce northeast storm which
struck this port Saturday night and
i continued all day Sunday with great
i velocity swept out of existence a large
I fleet of sailing vessels which anchored
j off this port to escape its fury. It is
known that at least four men have
perished and it is probable that as
many more lost their lives. Twenty
! one schooners, nearly all heavily laden,
i and one barkentine, are ashore, four
schooners now lying at anchor are
totally dismasted, two others were
i sunk and one bark is resting on the
bottom entirely submerged. Many
other vessels were battered and par
tially stripped of their rigging.
THE PORTLAND THOUGHT
TO HAVE GONE DOWN
BOSTON, Nov. 28.â The managers of
tin; Boston and Portland Steamship
Cumpany stated to-night that there
are grave doubts as to the safety of the
steamer Portland, which sailed from
here Saturday night. Every harbor
between here and Portland on the
north shore has been heard from and
one on the south shore and in no case
has the steamer been seen. The only
remaining harbor which she could
have reached is Provincetown on Cape
Cod, and news from that port is anx
iously awaited, as it is still Impossible
to reach that port by wire. She car
ried sixty-five passengers and a crew
of fifteen men.
CREWS SAVED FROM
THREE WRECKED VESSELS
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â Chief Kir- I
ball of the Life Saving Service has re- )
ceived a telegram stating that the j
schooner Ivey Bell, bound from Boston j
to Bristol, is stranded near Jerrys '
Point, N. H. The crew of four were j
saved by the life-saving crew. The j
vessel is said to be a total loss. An- (
other telegram states that the British !
brig Champion and the schooner C. J.
Willard are ashore in Quarry Bay, j
Maine. The Champion will be a total j
loss. The crews are safe.
PASSENGERS AND
CREW REACH SHORE
BOSTON, Nov. 28.â The steamer Fair
fax, Captain Johnson, of the Merchants'
and Miners' Company, from Baltimore,
to this city, is ashore on the Sow and
Pigs off Cuttinhun Hunk and is full of
water to her main deck. She was
spoken yesterday by Captain Hallett
of the steamer H. M. Whittley and her
passengers taken off and brought to
this city. Captain Johnson and the
crew of the steamer remained on board
and assistance will be sent to them
from Vineyard Haven as soon as pos
sible.

HOBSON REFUSES TO
LECTURE FOR RICHES
Declines to Accept a Dazzliog
Offer of Fifty ThousaQd for
One Season.
NEW'YORK, Nov. 28.â The Washington correspondent of the
Herald telegraphs: Naval Constructor Richmond Pearson Hobson
has recently refused an offer of $50,000 from a New York lecturt*
bureau for a stated number of lectures during this season.
Explaining the reason for his refusal to a friend to-day, while on
his way from Annapolis to Washington, Hobson said: "It would be
idle for me to say that I did not consider the proposition carefully. I
did. My people are all in moderate circumstances, but my reflections
led me to this conclusion: Before the sinking of the Merrimac my
lectures would have been worth probably not more than 50 cents,
and the sinking of the Merrimac seems to have made them worth
150,000. The work which so suddenly raised my stock in the literary
trade was done in the simple execution of my duty as an officer in
the American navy. I did not feel that I had a right to use the
performance of that duty for my financial betterment. I therefore
declined the offer of $50,000. I have, however, agreed to contribute
some articles to one of the magazines, but this is different, and, I
might add, carries no independent fortune with it."
Another offer of $200 was made to Hobson Saturday at Annapolis
for a twenty- minute talk at Norfolk, and in refusing this offer he
spoke of having refused the $50,000 offer.

AMERICAN COMMISSIONERS
ARE WELL SATISFIED
PARIS. Nov. 28.â The American Com
missioners are naturally well pleased
at the successful conclusion of their
mission. The questions that remain
are comparatively unimportant and ad
mit of speedy settlement. The Ameri
can Commissioners will hasten matters
with a view'of having the treaty signed
within ten days or so and of sailing for
New York by December 17.
Judge Day said this evening: "We
have done the only thing possible re
garding the Philippines. Our oppor
tunity of giving them up was lost when
Admiral Dewey did not weigh anchor
and sail away."
Whitelaw Reid entertained the
United States Commissioners at din
ner this evening, after which all went
to the opera.
Count yon Munster, the German Em
baiteador to France, was the rirst dip
lomat to call at the American head
quarters this afternoon and to congrat
ulate Mr.Reid on the commission's suc
cessful work. He said the setttlement
would meet with the approval of Ger
many.
MINOR MATTERS WILL
NOW BE CONSIDERED
PARIS, .Nov. 2S.â Having embodied
in the treaty articles all the protocol
questions, the two commissions will
now enter upon friendly negotiations
regarding the matters suggested in the
American ultimatum a week ago, mat
ters subsidiary and incidental to the
principal provisions which must form
I .art of the* peace treaty as finally
signed. These include the religious
freedom of the Caroline Islands as
agreed to twelve years ago; the re
lease of political prisoners now held by
Spain in connection with the insurrec
tions in Cuba and the Philippines, the
taking over of the Island of Kusaie, or
Ualan, of the Carolines, for a tele
graphic and naval station; cable sta
tion rights at other points in Spain's
jurisdiction and the renewal of certain
treaties previously in force between the
United States and Spain which may
have lapsed or been vitiated by war.
SIGNIFICANCE OF BARON
SPECK'S FRIENDLY CALL
WASHINGTON, Nov. I.B.â Baron
Speck yon Sternberg, Charge d'Affaires
of Germany, called at the State De
partment to-day and had a conference
with Secretary Hay on current topics,
particularly those growing out of the
late war, in the course of which Baron
Speck took occasion to express the most
friendly sentiments on the part of Ger
many concerning the present state of
affairs. The call was chiefly significant
as an evidence that German officials
desire to counteract the reports that
Germany is about to assume an atti
tude of protest and to lay claim to the
Sulu Archipelago, which is to be in
cluded in the peace negotiations at
Paris. Baron Speck's call gave rise to
sensational published reports to the ef
fect that he had presented a protest
from Germany against interference
with the Sul% Islands.
In view of these reports it was stated
to-night in an authoritative quarter
that the Sulu Islands were not men
tioned during the talk, which was of a
most friendly character. Although the
cable reports have shown that the Ger
man press is considerably wrought up
over the policy of the United States In
the Far East and is urging the Gov
ernment to make a protest, nothing ha?
developed in official quarters up to the
present time to show that there is any
purpose on the part of the German Gov
ernment to heed such belligerent sug
gestions. On the contrary, the call of
Baron Speck to-day gives assurance
that Germany accepts without question
the outcome of the peace negotiations.

BLAMED FOR
THE DISASTER
T. C. Walker Wreck
Accidental.
VERDICT OF CORONER'S JURY
INQUEST OVER THE BODIES OF
SIX VICTIMS.
Mrs. Frances Robinson, the Heroine
of the Luckless Vessel, Dan
gerously 111 â Seventh.
Death Occurs.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Nov. 28.â 50 far as the
verdict of a Coroner's Jury goes the
California Navigation Company stands
acquitted of responsibility for the
steamboat T. C. Walker disaster. Late
this afternoon the jury returned six
verdicts, one for each victim dead at
that time. In each case it was stated
that the deceased came to his death by
the accidental bursting of the steam
drum.
Manager Corcoran and Attorney Le
vinsky were on hand at the hearing to
see that the interests of the company
were protected, but found it unneces
sary to ask any questions of the wit
nesses. However, the certificate of the
United States inspector of boilers was
offered in evidence to establish the fact
that at the last inspection the machin
ery passed muster.
Another death to-night makes the
list of killed reach seven. Of the
wounded now at the County Hospital
it is said that two will probably die.
Jimmie Corcoran and G. Foppianu. The
last one to succumb to his injuries was
Louis Brizzolara of San Francisco, who
died to-night at 7:30 o'clock on the
steamer Dauntless, now on the way to
San Francisco. The sufferer was car
ried aboard the Dauntless at the pjene
of the accident on Sunday mcrning
when the opposition steamer came
along, and it was feared then that he
was seriously hurt. On arriving here
the attending physicians would not con
sent to remove him from the stateroom
on the steamer for fear he would pass
away, as he had not recovered con
sciousness.
The deceased was a coal merchant at
1015 Washington street, San Francisco,
and was on a trip to Stockton on Sun
day with his wife and his son-in-law,
Charles Maggini of the firm of Garcia
& Maggini, commission merchants, of
Washington and Drumm streets, also
Mrs. Maggini and a younger sister. The
party was standing on the forward part
of the upper deck of the Walker when
the explosion came and the old gentle
man was the only one hurt. He was
struck by some part of the woodwork
and received a stunning blow on the
right side, just above the hip, and was
frightfully scalded by the escaping
steam.
The first funeral resulting from the
Walker disaster took place this after
noon when the last rites were said
over the bodies of Engineer Henry and
his wife at their late home. Husband
and wife lay side by side in caskets, a
sad spectacle. The sermon waÃ
preached by Dr. Evans of the Central
Methodist Episcopal Church. The eld
est son of Mr. and Mrs. Henry came up
from San Francisco and took charge
of the remains, which will be shipped
to San Francisco for interment to-mor
row morning.
The body of W. A. Blunt will be
shipped to relatives in Oakland. Blunt
was formerly of Merced and both his
parents are dead. He has brothers and
sisters in this State and in Butte, Mont.
The remains of Captain Tulan were
taken to the home of his brother, Peter
Tulan, in McCloud's Addition.
So far no one has called or inquired
for the remains of Ferdinand Law, the
last one to die. He said he came
from Washington and Seattle and gave
the inference that he was coming here
on a visit.
The remains of Jerry Daily and Law
are still at the morgue.
Mrs. Robinson, the heroine of the dis
aster, is lying dangerously ill at the
! Grand Central Hotel pleuritas and
pleuro-pneumonla having developed as
the result of her working scantily at
tired in the morninÂ«r. Many prominent
people have called during the day to
inquire after the lady. Dr. Herbert,
who is attending her, hopes to check
the illness before it reaches a critical
stage.
There Is a possibility that one or two
of the unfortunates who were on the
Walker were drowned. There are
many who are positive that some eltHer
Jumped or were blown overboard, and
but one, a deckhand, was drawn from
the water. It 1b said that when the
explosion occurred some who were
sleeping in the forward rooms of the
steamer rushed out on deck and in
their friKht sprang overboard. Several
claim to have heard splashes in -the
water and cries for help. The groans
and sufferings of those on board caused
the crtes in the water to be forgotten.
It is quite probable that some were sit
ting on benches on the promenade deck
near the smokestacks, that having
been a favorite resting place for those
who did not take rooms on the vessel,
and were blown overboard. The force
of the explosion was strongest at that
place and if any one were near there
they must have been hurled over into
the water.
In spite of the Coroner's jury's verdict,
the rumor has been persistent that the
"Walker's boilers were not up to the re
quirements. A story frequently told
is that lately a man belonging in the
engine room gave up h,is position, de
claying that the boilers were danger
ous. If there was any truth in this
story it did not come out at the in
quest.
Deputy County Clerk Robert Fyfe
of San Joaqu^Q County was a
passenger on the Walker, and he
gives a graphic account of the tragic
incidents that preceded the death of
Captain Tulan. Mr. Fyfe was in his
berth when the explosion occurred.
"When it came," said he, "the noise
and shock of the concussion was some
thing terrific. It dazed me so I did
not realize what had happened for
many minutes. I dressed as hurriedly
as my excited condition would allow,
and went on deck. I went forward and
leaned over the railing above the lower
deck, and saw some men carrying the
mutilated remains of Captain Tulan.
Standing- beside me, watching the
sight, was a lady, who afterward prov
ed to be Mrs. Peter Tulan, sister-in-law
of the man they were carrying away.
" 'Oh, the poor fellow!' she said in
sympathy.
"We then went below and followed to
the room where the lody of the captain
had been carried. On the way we saw
the mangled forms of the wounded
writhing in pain. I shut my eyes, be
cause I did not have the nerve to wit
ness their suffering. Several men were
around the bed of Captain Tulan, bath
ing his wounds with oil and minis
tering to him in every way they possi
bly could to alleviate his pains. As
soon as the lady saw his face she cried
out:
" 'Oh, God! It's my brother-in-law.'
"'I am done for,' answered Tulan,
with an effort that evidently caused
him the most acute pain.
"The captain bore his sufferings
bravely. The only complaint that he
uttered was when some one closed the
door.
" 'For God's sake, don't shut the
door,' he said, 'I am suffocating as
it i?.'
"Even the slight draft that came in
through tho door seemed to be a relief
and to lessen some of his pain. He was
conscious of everything that was done
until he breathed his last, about four
hours after the explosion, and just as
we were approaching the landing at
Stockton. His wounds presented a hor
rible sight, as there was not a spot on
his body that had not been seared by
the scalding steam. The burns inter
nally were doubtless more severe than
those that showed on the surface.
COMPANY HAVING ITS
SHARE OF HARD LUCK
During the last -ear or so the Califor
nia Navigation and Improvement Com
pany has had more than its share of
hard luck. It started with the sinking
of the Leader by the J. D. Peters.
The Leader was on her way hither
from Stockton with a band of sheep on
the lower deck, and about 100 lunatics
en route to Napa from the Stockton in
stitution, on the upper deck state
rooms There were cross signals with
the result that the Leader was cut
down and sunk. The sheep were
drowned, but the passengers were all
Next a lamp exploded on the Mary
Garratt and all her upper works were
destroyed before the resulting conflag
ration was extinguished. Then came the
sinking of the J. D. Peters in a collision
with the Czarina and now the explo
sion on the T. C. Walker.
John K. Bulger. United States In
spector of Boilers, went to Stockton
last night, and Captain O. F. Bolles,
Inspector of Hulls, went this morning.
They will hold a preliminary examina
tion* this afternoon. The City of Stock
tun will take the Walker's place on the
run to-night, and on Friday night the
H. J. Corcoran will be put on. starting
from Stockton. In about three weeks
it is expected that the Walker will be
fixed up and ready for travel again.

Weekly Call, $1.50 w YearSHERMAN TOOK SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
TO BRIBE COUNCILMEN OF LOS ANGELES
How the Great Manipulator Made Profit
From the Consolidation of the
Roads.
Part the Examiner and Chronicle
Played in the War of Bankers
and Local Capitalists.
In the history r>f great events in Cali
fornia there is probably no more re
pulsive figure than that of Moses H.
Sherman. The Call has shown how
this man's personality was intimately
Involved in tho affairs of the Pacific
Bank and the People's Home Savings
Bank. For years Sherman operated in
devious ways to secure for himself out
of the vault? of the Pacific Bank and
the People's Home Savings Bank a tre
mendous fortune. Before he began his
manipulation? he had passed through
scenes and incidents that come to few
men in their live?. When he formed
his great plot to pla^e in his private
purse the enormous sum of money that
business men and poor people had en
trusted to the honor of the McDonald
family he had won for himself the title
of an unscrupulous adventurer.
In the secret history of these institu
tions Moses H. Sherman was his own
worst accuser. By his own will and in
his own handwriting he asked his con
federates and his dupes to believe him
dishonest. Through his own admis
sions h^ was a corrupter of legislatures,
a tricky, dishonest competitor in busi
ness and a briber of governmental of
ficials.
These are not the accusations of The
Pall, but the shameless admission of
a H. Sherman himself.
In his code of business ethics any dis
honorable act is legitimate. He saw
no wrong in any dishonest transaction
if the result. of that transaction finan
cially justified its performance. Neither
this man's personality nor his. methods
would be nf public interest were it not
for the lamentable fact that thousands
of people of this city suffered from his
operations. The Call has already ex
posed this manipulator from many
points of view. "Where other black
legs operated. with dollars he handled
hundreds of thousands. His career,
therefore,' is of general Interest to the
people of this State, and The Call will
show, this morning' how in one.deal'he
received from the shrewdest financiers
who ever! 7fved on this coast $60,000 for i
bribing tIK; City Council of IJos An
geles! â ;'... ' ' . :
There is absolutely no evidence to
prove that Moses H. Sherman ever gave
a dishonest dollar to the Council of Los
Angeles. There is much to indicate that
per did so, but in his horrifying
he took the names and the honor
c<f decent men to fill his own purse, and
in the concluding scheme of his great
electric road deal his word that he had
bought the honor of public officials was
adopted and he received $60,000 as the
pri^e of other men's honor.
The history of this deal is from its
very nature dramatic. The story is
that of the creation of the Los Ange
les Electric Railroad and the destruc
tion of the tremendous finnneipl inter
ests that Were involved in the cable
road of the same city. It may be said
to the credit of Mr. Sherman that he
never dealt in small things. When he
gambled with the reputations of other
men and with his own he played for
high stakes. When he schemed to win
a fortune he schemed to make a great
One, and in his operations at Los An
geles lie played for millions. He seemed
almost to bÂ»- financially mad, and
with the great treasury of one of the
greatest banks in California behind him
he bepan his corrupt manipulations
with millions of dollars. He had against
him as competitors such men as James
<;. Fair, Thomas Brown of the Bank of
California and Lovell White of the San
Francisco Savings Union. But Sherman
was eqlial.' to the task, and when the
f-wl came he was master of the situ
ation. â  ; '.;.".
The history of the transaction of the
alleged brjbe'&f tho City Council of Los
â  s icannpt be understood thor
oughly unless- it is read iri conection
v.ith ..the- entire history of Sherman's
Los Angeles Electric Railroad deal.
When Sherman entered Los Angeles as
a manipulator he found that a popu
lar ami profitable cable road was al
ready In" existence. He had already met
th<- McDonalds, Â£.h<t had induced Frank
McDonaM to indorse and support â  the
Phoenix property, .which subsequently
proved to be Bucft ;i disastrous specula
tion to th< Bank, and the Peo
ple's Home Sayings Bank. Having won
an unexpect< I measure of success in
Phoenix, Shornnin. in IRS9. went to Los
Angeles and ingratiated:- -himself Into
the confidence of the owners of the To
j.f.-ka Rapid Transit Company. This
concern possessed several franchises in
Angeles, and. operated a certain
road. When Sherman came upon the
scene the Topoka Rapid Transit Com
pany needed money. Through the ef
forts of Sherman the company receiv
ed from "the People's Home Savings
Bank a loan of $25,800. This was con
sidered, in -view of tho rendition of the
company, ; as an unsually gracious ac
commodation on the part of the bank.
When the money } 'â <-:irno due, how
ever, it. was promptly paid.
This started tho groat Los Angeles
electric deal. Certain, officers of the
People's Home Savings Bank had
strongly objected to th loan, a..d for a
time there was considerable friction;
but there was a sugj, ation that the Pa-
cific Bank would assume the loan, and
the affair was adjusted. Sherman, In
A all this deal, had actrn secretly as the
hgoni of the Topeka Rapid Transit
Company.. At 'hat time there was. a
real estate boom in' Los Angeles, and
the people of the city were caper to
support any enterprise that promised
an improvement to the town. Sher
man, of course, was far-seelÂ»g, and in
tended. If he could, to ret possession of
Uie company and the railroad which he
had supported. It was not long before
he had bought the railroad and its
franchise to operate on certain streets
of Los Angeles. In the meantime, cer
tain bankers of Los Angeles had ob
tained a franchise for another road that
was to parallel the road of the Topeka
Rapid Transit Company. These bankers
intended seriously to enter the field as
competitors to the Topeka people.
When the competing franchise was
obtained a contract was made with the
Pacific Rolling Mills of this city to
build the road. Sherman in some way
discovered this fact and then began his
great manipulations to destroy all rail
i road competition in Los Angeles and to
; control the local situation as far as
transportation facilities were concern
ed. Sherman played the rolling mill
against the bankers and succeeded In
frightening both. The franchises
which had been obtained by the bank
â  ers were turned over to Sherman, who
then obtained new franchises from the
City Council of Los Angeles. The
j manipulators always contended that he
i had been forced to bribe the Council
! for these franchises, but there is abso
lutely no evidence to show that he told
the truth. The town, as already de-
I scribed, was at that time enjoying a
boom and people residing in the outside
'â  districts were eager to give encourage
; ment to any scheme that would ad
vance the value of outside property.
; Sherman had entered the f>ld with a
\ new ideaâ that of an electric roadâ
which, he maintained, could be ope
i rated for one-third less than it cost to
I run a cable road. His argument on
this point frightened the Los Angeles
; bankers and the Pacific Rolling Mill
people. Agents were sent to Oregon
' and Washington and to other northern
places to ascertain what it cost to ope
rate an electric road. These reports
showed that Sherman was perfectly
correct in his assumptions. The fran
chises, therefore, that had been obtained
by the bankers were turned over to
< Sherman, who had thus become, even
i at this early stage, master of the situa
tion.
In the cable railroad, however, he
had a most formidable competitor,
which it was absolutely indispensable
! for him to crush. At that time Wll
j Ham Alvord, L. D. Benchley, the Pa
cific Rolling Mills, Thomas Brown and
the Bank of California were very much
'â â  interested in the cable mad of Los An
, geles. They held hundreds of thou
; sands of dollars of bonds of this road
I and necessarily for their own security
wished to see it a permanent success.
Sherman, however, succeeded in win
; ning the confidence of the managers
' and directors of the Pacific Rolling
Mills and induced them to build a com
peting electric railroad in Los Angeles
upon conditions that were most favor
! able to Moses H. Sherman.
In the agreement of the Pacific Roll
, ing Mills to construct tho road the local
corporation declared that it would ac
cept the price of construction in a cer
. tain way. The money was to be paid
1 one-third in cash and for the remain
j der the Pacific Rolling Mills agreed to
: take two-thirds of the bonds of the new
' electric railroad. Under the terms of
i the agreement the Pacific Rolling Mills
| promised not only to construct the road
1 itself and to build the cars, but to erect
the power-house. This promise was one
of the most extraordinary business
transactions ever undertaken in Cali
â  fornia. The Pacific Rolling Mills, as was
; already indicated, was vitally interested
: in the success of the cable railroad. The
rolling mills held hundreds of thou
sands of dollars of the bonds of this
; road, yet, notwithstanding this fact, it
f entered into an agreement to build a
competing road and thus become a
great factor in injuring the value of the
: bonds it already possessed.
j The managers of the cable road nat
urally became very fearful. The dom
inatinÂ£_splrit in the cable road of Los
! Angeles at that time was J. F. Crank,
i who represented and showed clearly to
his principals in this city what they
were doing. These principals were deaf
to Crank's arguments, and it was de
| cided to carry out the agreement with
Sherman. When the terms of this com
pact were made Sherman promised to
obtain his share of one-third in cash.
This cash was to be supplied by the
Pacific Bank under certain conditions
that are still of vital moment and which
will be exploited by The Call at the
proper time. Sherman, as a matter of
course, was not venturing any money
of his own, and in order to obtain the
coin from the Pacific Bank he entered
into a secret compact with that insti
tution.
As soon as he had established a busi
ness relationship with the Pacific Roll
i ing Mills. Sherman saw the tremendous
advantage of enlarging his field of op
erations and he sought new franchises
from the city government of Los Ange-
I les. These privileges to operate elec
! trie railroads were most unusually
! generous, and Sherman, after he had
! concluded, had the power, if he wished
! to exercise it, of literally cobwebbing
the town with electric roads. He
claimed that it was absolutely neces
sary for him in order to obtain these
franchises to bribe the City Council of
! Los Angeles. His assertion was never
| a public one, as a matter of course, and
I was accepted by the men with whom
Sherman dealt as the truth. It was
known by those who were interested
that Sherman had in his manipulations
obtained the very valuable assistance
of certain men very high in authority in
the Southern Pacific Company. The al
leged fact of bribery, therefore, was
accepted without question.
The situation had now become a most

curious one. The Pacific Rolling Mills,
the Bank of California, the San Fran
cisco Savings Union, James G. Fair and
other capitalists in this city and Oak
land were placed in the dubious light of
deliberately jeopardizing their own in
terests. The Pacific Rolling Mills had
nearly $200,000 in the cable railroad of
Los Angeles. The rolling mills had
a very large overdraft in the Bank
of California. James G. Fair was not
long in becoming aware of this situa
tion. He saw that the construction of
the electric railroad would cost a vast
sum of money and he determined to
take a hand in the game himself. He
demanded a thorough investigation and
asked why it was that the Pacific Roll
ing Mills, of which William Alvord was
then president, and in which James G.
Fair was deeply interested, had tried to
kill the cable bonds it owned by con
structing a competing electric line and
accepting for the cost of construction
the bonds of the new electric railroad.
There was atout that time a series of
very Important changes made in the di
rectory and management of the Pacific
Rolling Mills. William Alvord was re
tired as president and James G. Fair
succeeded him. L. D. Benchley gave up
his position as manager and Patrick
Noble took his place. Fair considered
the time opportune to demand from
Moses H. Sherman and Frank V. Mc-
Donald a strict accounting of the af
fairs of the Los Angeles electric rail
road. The Pacific Rolling Mills had al
ready expended a vast amount of mon
ey and material in the construction of
the road, and Fair demanded to know
where and how the money had been
spent.
As a matter of necessity Moses H.
Sherman had handled much of these
funds. Fair's secretary, Bresse.Â»made
the investigation and submitted his re
port. There was in the item of ex
penses a sum aggregating several thou
sands of dollars which created pome
discussion. Sherman declared then in
making his accounting that he had been
forced to expend a large sum of money
in bribing the City Council of Los An
geles to obtain necessary franchises for
the electric railroad. Fair made abso
lutely no objection to this item and
accepted it as an ordinary expense. On
incidental matters of construction,
however, he fought over items no larger
than a hundred dollars. In matters of
absolutely honest business he was con
servative even to the point of parsi
mony, but In "greasing affairs," as
Sherman termed them. Fair had no
comment to make. â¢
The Los Angeles electric railroad had
already issued $1,480,000 in bonds. This
issue was divided up among the various
interests. The Pacific Bank accepted 5R6
bonds at an average cost of 60 cents.
Several of Sherman's personal friends
had accepted the bonds and the Pacific
Rolling Mills, as already described, had
agreed to accept two-thirds of the
amount of money it expended in the
construction of the road in bonds.
After Sherman and Frank McDonald
made their accounting to James (I.
Fair the actual plot to ruin the cable
railroad of Los Angeles began. Sher
man is authority for the statement that
any dishonorable transaction was per
sonally legitimate in this scheme to ruin
the cable road. This concern at that
time had nearly $1,300,000 issued in
bonds. It had received a grace of six
months in which to pay its interest on
these bonds. When this period of grace
had expired the managers of the cable
company were unable to meet their ob
ligations. Sherman had used every ar
tifice to discover the secrets of the cable
company and he employed agent after
agent to spy into his competitor's af
fairs. J. H. Woodard, who subsequent
ly became Sherman's uncompromising
enemy, was employed to' betray the
cable company.
When the cnble railroad defaulted in
the payment of its interest, and J. F,
frank, the manager of the road, knew
that Sherman and the managers of the
Pacific Bank, and incidentally the di
rectors of the People's Home Savings
Bank, were scheming against him, he
came to this city. Shortly after his ar
rival he was in earnest conversation
with some of the heaviest holders of
the cable bonds. He went to Thomas
Brown of the Bank of California and
Lovell White of the San Francisco Sav
ings Union. 'Whatever practical re
sults came from these consultations
the public never knew.
A few days after the arrival of
Crank, however, a most extraordinary
incident startled the town. Two of
the morning papers of this city â the
Chronicle and the Examiner â published
an article on the same morning in ref
erence to the Los Angeles Electric
Railroad bonds, and particularly to the
fact that the Pacific Bank and the
People's Home Savings Bank held
large quantities of these bonds. These
articles, published on the same morning,
contained thesamefacts. They were, as
far as their statements were concerned,
absolutely identical. To a casual ob
server it might have seemed that both
articles were written by the same man.
The result of the publication of these
, articles was a run on the People's
1 Home Savings Bank. This was in
June, 1891, and was the first practical
result of the tremendous war between
the cable railroad and the electric rail
road of Lob Angeles, with Sherman and
the Pacific Bank on one side and
Crank, Tom Brown of the Bank of
California and the San Francisco Sav
ings Union on the other. The McDon
alds were in the greatest consternation
when they learned there was a run on
the People's Home Savings Bank. It
so happened that at that time there
was in the vaults of the Pacific Bank a
large sum of money. The McDonalds
and their agents hired express wagons,
loaded sacks of gold into them, and
with great spectacular effect appeared
at the doors of the People's Home Sav
ings Bank, The run was stopped and
the bank was saved.
The night before the McDonalds had
tried their utmost to prevent the Ex
aminer and the Chronicle from publish
ing their articles. It was represented
*
to the managers of these newspapers
that the attack on the bonds of the
electric railroad was the result simply
of the intense competition between the
two great street railway corporations
of Los Angeles. Every effort, however,
to prevent the publication of the article
was in vain, md when both news
papers appeared on the following
morning with the statement that the
People's Home Savings Bank had un
wisely accepted the dangerous securi
ties of the Los Angeles PJlectric Rail
road the run on the institution fol
lowed. The bank, as already describ
ed, was fortunately saved by the time
ly arrival of gold from the Pacific
Bank.
Sherman had now advanced very far
in his scheme. He had behind him the
tremendous resources of the Pacific
Bank and against him the Bank of
California and several other powerful
institutions in this city.
The war between Sherman and
Crank and the electric railroad
and the cable railroad of Los
Angeles became more bitter. Those
who had invested hundreds of thousands
of dollars in this concern recognized
that one of two alternatives must be
accepted. One or both of the roads
must be destroyed as the result of the
war or both roads would have to be
consolidated. After the run on the Peo
ple's Home Savings Bank there were a
series of negotiations between repre
sentatives of the electric railroad and
those of the cable railroad. Time after
time these men met and discussed the
situation.
John McKee, who was at that time
president of the clearing-house and
cashier of the Tallant Bank, and Lovell
White, the president of the San Fran
cisco Savings Union, sent for Frank
McDonald and Sherman. There was a
preliminary conference, each represen
tative discussing the interests he pos
sessed. White in his official capacity
as president of the San Francisco Sav
ings Union had a quarter of a million
dollars in bonds of the Los Angeles
Cable Railroad. McKee, as agent of the
Protestant Orphan Asylum of this city,
had $50,000 of these bonds. The Bank
of California in its own capacity and in
its relationship with the Pacific Rolling
Mills had nearly two hundred thousand
dollars in these bonds.
A series of conferences, as already
described, were held. There were infor
mal dinners at prominent restaurants
In this City and long consultations at
the rooms of Sherman in the Baldwin
Hotel. It was at first decided, after
the representatives had determined t-Â«
consolidate both roads, that a $1,000,000
issue of bonds would be made. This
was subsequently changed to a $3,000,
000 issue, in which $221,000 remained for
outside parties after the cable interests
and the electric interests had been
satisfied.
In arranging an equitable distribution
of the bonds between the cable railroad
and the electric railroad Sherman de
manded that the company be given
sixty bonds, representing $60,000, which
Moses H. Sherman declared was neces
sary to cover his expenses In "greas
ing" the City Council of Los Angeles.
In the negotiations there was much
discussion over this Item. Sherman in
sisted that he had paid the money in
bribes and he must become compen
sated or the deal would not be effected.
The other representatives finally accpt
ed Sherman's terms and he received the
bonds. This incident was the last in
the negotiations that culminated in the
consolidation of the two roads.
In the preliminary stages of the war
between the electric railroad and the
cabin railroad, when James G. Fnir
worked a revolution in the Pacific Roll
ing Mills and demanded an accounting
from Sherman and Frank McDonald,
there was no discussion of the tremen
dous item that Sherman claimed rep
resented bribery or. as he termed it,
with a wink, "greasing."
James (J. Fair was a thorough man
of thp world, a practical business man
who understood the efficacy of ringing
arguments when sometimes made to
public officials. When Lovell White and
John McKee were asked, however, to
audit Sherman's "greasing fund" of
sixty thousand, dollars they hesitated.
They did not possess the wide range of
knowledge that Fair displayed. Unlike
him they did not know the busy scenes
of Legislatures and the ways that are
devious and dark in the chambers of
City Councils and Supervisors. But
McKee and White had willing instruc
tors. McKee particularly had been in
troduced by Sherman's friends to the
grape-vine route that frequently leads
to official favor. He and White listened
patiently to the arguments in favor of
Sherman's "greasing fund. " Both gen
tlemen were resting in easy digestion
of a comfortable dinner and with a
shrug of the shoulders and a genial
smile they acceded to Sherman's de
mand and the compact was complete.
If things were as they were and in the
natural .course of events had to be the
only alternative was to submit. Messrs.
White and McKee had some aspirations
to be considered philosophers as well as
bankers.
The union of the two concerns was
effected in 1802, and the new corpora
tion became known as the Consolidated
Electric Railway Company of Los An
geles. Sherman, as a matter of course,
remained in control. He demanded in
the new issue of bonds that two years'
interest be sacrificed 'y the bondhold
ers. This new issue of three million of
dollars earned nothing, therefore, dur
ing the period of two years which Sher
man demanded. The manipulator had
absolute dictation of all the affairs of
the road, which, it is claimed, earned
from forty thousand to sixty thousand
dollars a month.
This enormous sum of money, as well
as the expediture of every dollar for the
operation of the road, was under the
control of Sherman for two years. This
man did not have to account to any
one. The bondholders could not expect
any return on their investment for at
least two years. Sherman was absolute
master of the situation. He had re-
ceived an enormous sum of money for
himself. He had obtained in addition
to his own share $60,000, and in all the
negotiations that led up to the final
consolidation of the roads he had met
with only one stumbling block.
After the negotiations leading toward
consolidation were under way Sherman
found no difficulty in securing the sat
isfaction of his demands. When he de
clared that he had "greased" the City
Council of Los Angeles the men with
whom he was negotiating accepted his
assertion as the truth. Antecedent to
that acceptance, however, Sherman had
to remove a stumbling block in the per-
son of John McKee. It has already
been shown that McKee in a fiduciary
capacity was deeply interested in the
cable railroad of Los Angeles. When
the scheme of consolidation was pro-
posed McKee showed a tendency to be
fractious. He was not willing to take
part in the deliberations and Sherman
as usual was equal to the emergency.
There wore some private talks with Mr.
McKee and certain very close friends of
Sherman and the president of the
Clearing-house opened another set of
negotiations.
Sherman's friends possessed a cer
tain persuasive eloquence and sub
mitted such convincing arguments that
Mr. McKee became a factor in the de
liberations that culminated in the con
solidation of the two roads. His apathy
was transformed into energy and in
consideration of certain labors that he
performed in Chicago he received
$7000, represented in seven bonds of the
Consolidated Electric Railway Com
pany. Some of those who had the
privilege of knowing the inside history
of the consolidation believed that Mr.
McKee'scompensation should have been
$12,000. Others, who certainly had a
right to know, understood that the
sum should have been $15,000.
As already described, Sherman had
absolute control of the electric railroad
for two years after the consolidation.
He hadwonagreat triumph and with his
wit had wrested a fortune from
shrewder men than himself. In win
ning his fortune he' had shamelessly
declared that he had bribed at least
two of the City Councils of Los An
geles. The facts in reference to the of
ficial grant of franchises to the Los
Angeles Electric Railroad are interest
ing. The first franchise for the Los
Angeles Consolidated Railway Com
pany was secured in October, 1890. It
was granted in .the name of an indi
vidual and was transferred for a con
sideration about eighteen months
afterward tp the electric road corpora
tion. This franchise covered a great
many of the streets of Los Angeles. It
was Sherman's habit never to ask for
anything in his own name, and on a
subsequent day a large number of new
franchises was granted to different
private persons.
There were fifteen of these franchises,
which were again transferred to the
electric railroad corporation. In all
the negotiations Sherman never ap
peared on the surface. Property-own
ers and speculators asked for the rail
road privileges and received them in
every instance by a unanimous vote of
the City Council. What it cost Sher
man to effect these deals, either
through the <'ity Councils or with the
private individuals, no one knows.
When the first franchise was granted
in October, 1890, the City Council of
Ln s Angeles consisted of the following
men: First Ward, H. Van Dusen: Sec
ond Ward, CJeorge P. McLain; Third
Ward, W. H. Bonsall; Fourth Ward,
Jacob Frankenfield: Fifth Ward. A. C.
Shafer: Sixth Ward. E. If. Hamilton;
Seventh Ward. James T. Brown;
Eighth Ward, Theofiore Summerland;
Ninth Ward, R. E. WiFhiner.
The franchises that were received by
Moses H. Sherman in IR9I were granted
to him through his agents by the fol
lowing City Council of Los Angeles:
First Ward, F. M. Nikell; Second Ward,
Daniel Innis; Third Ward. W. H. Bon*
sail; Fourth Ward, â . Rhodes; Fifth
Ward. J. Q. A. Tufts; Sixth Ward, C.
H. Alford; Seventh Ward, D. McOarry;
Eighth Ward, Theodore Summerland;
Ninth Ward, Samuel Reese.
These are the men that Mopes H.
Sherman received $fiO,ooo for bribing. !
There is nothing absolutely to indicate
that these public officers were corrupt
ed except the uncorroborated word of i
Moses H. Sherman He received, how- j
ever, $60,000 on his word that he cor- :
rupted these men. At the time the
franchises were granted there was no
scandal in connection with the trans
action. The men who occupied posi
tions In the City Council were men of
high standing. Frankonfleld was presi
dent of the California Bank of Los An
geles; McGarry was a director in the
First National Bank; Bonsall was pro
prietor/of th" Nadeau Hotel; Summer
land was County Assessor of Los An
geles; Tufts was a bank director; Nik
ell was a merchant, and Innis a cap
italist.
These are the men whom Moses H.
Sherman declared had been corrupted.
For two years after the consolidation
of the cable railroad of Los Angeles
and the electric railroad Sherman was
absolutely in command. Ihe great
manipulator was not even then satis
fied with the enormous profits that he
had obtained, and he secured another
franchise for himself for a road to
Pasadena and Santa Monica over the
very tracks of the Consolidated Elec
tric Railway Company. He holds this
franchise yet. and at any time may be
come a competitor to the Los Angeles
Electric Railroad. Aft^r two years had
expired after the consolidation Sher
man wag in duty bound, under his
contract to the bondholders, to begin
the payment of interest on the bonds.
The road defaulted on this interest,
and Sherman manipulated to get a new
bond issue. This he succeeded in do
ing. He wanted at first to obtain an
issue of $5,000,000. but he failed in this.
He succeeded, however, in getting a
new $3,000,000 issue, with a quarter of
a million dollars on the side. The Con
solidated Electric Railway Company
became the Los Angeles Railway Com
pany, and Moses H. Sherman had con
summated another tremendous deaL,*-

CORBETT SAYS
McVEY SOUGHT
TO SAVE.HIM
Statement Made by
His Second.
FEARED FOR EX-CHAMPION
ENTERED THE RING TO PRE
VENT A KNOCK-OUT.
Californian and Sailor Almost Come
to Blows "While the Lenox
Club Inquiry Is in
Progress.
, Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 28.â James J. Cor
bett declared to-day that he believed
"Connie" McVey innocent of any inten
tional or prearranged wrongdoing
when he entered the ring during the
ninth round of the Sharkey-Corbett
contest last Tuesday night, and conse
quently forfeited the contest to Shar
key.
This statement -on Corbett's part was
made at the close of the inquiry which
was instituted by the directors of the
Lenox Athletic Club to fix the respon
sibility for McVey's actions. The in
quiry, or investigation, took place in the
presence of a large number of sporting
men, the principals, with their hand
lers, and the club officials being pres
ent. The only absentee was McVey,
whose invasion of the ring caused all
the trouble. It was said that McVey
had left the city, but his whereabouts
could not be ascertained.
State Senator Timothy D. Sullivan,
representing the Lenox Athletic Club,
acted as chief inquisitor and invited
any and all of those present to ask
whatever questions they pleased of the
witnesses.
W. B. Gray, "Kid" McCoy's manager,
was the first witness. He said that six
or seven days before the fight, while
in company with McCoy, he met two
representatives of a local newspaper in
the Astor House. He told them that a
friend of his, whose name he was not
at liberty to disclose, had informed him
that the bout was to end in the ninth
round, and that Sharkey would be de
clared the winner. Senator Sullivan
asked Gray t<> produce his informer and
promised to give $500 to any charitable
organization or institution if Gray
would bring his man and have him re
peat the assertion. Gray left the build
ing, promising to try and get his
friend to reiterate the statement.
"Honest" John Kelly, the referee,
said:
"Up to the ninth round I thought it
was an even thine, and 1 firmly believe
that there was no faking on the part
of the principals, who were fighting to
the best of their ability. As to Mc-
Vey's actions, I believed then, and am
still of the opinion, that McVey was
â¢had' by some person or persons. The
reason that 1 declared all bets off
was to protect the public, as it was
clear to me that McVey's interfering
was a prearranged plan. I cannot
say who 'had' McVey. I don't believe
that he got into the ring to save. Cor
bett from defeat. Before the master
of ceremonies, < 'harles J. Harvey, an
nounced all bets off, John Considine
called on me to declare all bets off, bat
I told him that I had instructed Har
vey to anounce that fact three or four
minutes before that time."
Announcer Charles J. Harvey stated
that Kelly told him to announce that
Sharkey had won. and nfter a little de
lay he requested him to add that all
bets were off.
George Considine, Corbett's manager, j
was emphatic in his denial of any i
knowledge of a put-up job.
Charley White, Corbett's trainer,;
said he knew nothing of any deal or
job, and no man in the world could
get him to be a party to any crooked
work. He knew nothing of McVey's â 
intentions until Connie had jumped !
into the ring. He declared dramati
cally:
"I would kill any one if necessary to
prevent such an infringement of the <
rules."
Tom O'Rourke, Sharkey's manager,
thought Sharkey had undoubtedly the
best of the fight. In fact, Sharkey
was the only one in it.
"All I am sorry for," said he, "is that,
the contest ended as it did, but such a
thing cannot occur at the club again,
as a new rule has been made. In case
any man attempts to enter the ring in
the future he will be promptly ar
rested and the fight will be continued
and decided on its merits."
O'Rourke denied all knowledge of
any telegrams or documentary evi
dence which would tend to show col
lusion, and stated that the amount of
money which Sharkey received was
$16,845, while Corbett's share was 56845.
Those sums were made up of 65 and 35
per cent of a $20,000 purse and 50 per
cent of the receipts exceeding $40,000.
While O'Rourke was making his
statement Corbett and Sharkey growl
ed and snarled at each other, but they
desisted when requested by Senator
Sullivan.
Sharkey, on his own behalf, stated
that the fight was "on the level." He
went into the ring to win, and was con
vinced that he would have knocked
out Corbett in another round had the
fight gone on.
Corbett, the last witness, said:
"I won't believe McVey was bought.
He has been with me for many years.
I have supported him, and he has eaten
my bread and butter. After we re
turned to my dressing room on Tuesday
night McVey said to my brother Tom:
'I could not see the big fellow licked,
and I got into the ring. That is all
there was to it.' I had the best of
the fight from the second round."
Sharkey interrupted Corbett. saying:
"Why, you didn't have a dead man's
chance."
Corbett replied: "I never faked in
my life."
"Neither did I," retorted Sharkey.
Both men then assumed menacing at
titudes, and it looked for a moment as
if there would be a brawl: but Senator
Sullivan, who stood between them, re
quested them to keep quiet, and Cor
bet continued:
"You're too ignorant to understand
when a compliment is paid you, Shar- i
I key, but I'm 'Gentleman Jim,' and al
ways will be."
Corbett then went on to say that Me- â 
: Vey was impelled only by honest mo- j
! tives in doing what he did. and that no
1 man eould,make him beHeve otherwise.
Senator Sullivan reviewed the cvi-
I dence, and said:
"It seems that McVey thought Cor
bett was being beaten, and jumped into
the ring to save him. No evidence to
the contrary is forthcoming, and the
club directors have done all that they
i could to set the matter right in the eyes
of the public. As to the bets, we have !
' nothing further to do with them."
This ended the inquiry, so far as the
| club was concerned.
After it was over Corbett declared i
that Sharkey should give him another j
fight, and O'Rourke promised to give
I the Californian a chance. J

CONSTRUCTION
INVESTIGATED
An Admirable Witness
Is Expert Reid.
READY FACTS AND FIGURES
CONTRACTOR AND ARCHITECT
ARE IN ACTION.
The Expert Before the Senate Com
mittee Responds With Minute
Details of Measurements
and Prices.
The Senate committee charged with thÂ«
responsibility of investigating State In
stitutions held two sessions at the Har
bor Commissioner's office yest>erday. Ex
pert James W. Reid replied to aLI the in
quiries addressed to him by Senator*
Dickinson, Prisk and Boyee, and under
a certain form of cross-examination re
sponded promptly to inquiries from Con
tractors C. F. McCarthy, William Cronin.
Architect Edward R. Swain and Lawyer
E. B. Young.
The subject under consideration was
Expert Reid's report showing that the
State had been plundered of a vast sum
of money by a process of jugglery with
specifications and the introduction of ma
terials of construction in the ferry depot
other than those originally specified;
P. F. McCarthy, contractor for masonry,
said that he appeared for the sole pur
pose of defending the acts of the Harbor
Commissioners and Architect Swain. Mr.
McCarthy conducted the cross-examina
tion with skill and persistency, but ut
terly failed to weaken the case of the ex
pert. Mr. Reid was so well equipped with
facts and figures, and displayed such
masterly ability in elucidating every point,
clearing away all technicalities and pre
senting the plain truth, that the commit
tee and spectators listened with admira
tion to his ready, calm and comprehensive
replies.
He was ready at all times to go into
the most minute detail as to measure
ments, prompt to quote the price of ma
terials when the contracts were award
ed and when substitution of material and
chanpes of plans were allowed. He cal
culated the number of Roman pressed
brick and the enameled brick to. the Cubic
foot, he quoted the prices of galvanized
iron according to weight. Where, points
were in doubt he calculated that the ma
terials were supplied and the. work was
performed in good faith, thus reinforcing
his position that his report, was -fair to
the Harbor Commission, the contractor.*
and the architect. . .. . â .:"'â¢'. ' â :â¢" â¢
When Mr. McCarthy retired from the
attitude of cross-examiri-er Contractor W.
Cronan, through his attorney. El B:
Young, availed himself; of the. privilege to
ask questions concerning the methods
employed by the expert. Again Mr. Reid
replied with readiness to' a long line. of
questions. When the information as to
measurements and calculations were- not
given. in the most minute detail he segre
gated items and computed .-.the cost ac
cording to the fashion desired. by the at
torney. .â¢â  â¢: '"â â  'â â  â¢ :â¢
Mr. Reid readily admitted that there
could be an. honest difference of opinion
as to whether galvanized Iron or brick

the drawings together doubt was dis
pelled. â¢ .
Architect Swain insisted that the draw
ing clearly established the intention of
the architect that brick .should, be used.
Mr. Reid maintained that as both were
not used there should have been a re
duction to the State for one: or the other.
It was contended' by the cross-question
er that Mr. Reid's report specified a loss
to the State on both brick and iron. If
the reduction were charged against Mc-
Carthy, the brick contractor, it should

cross-questioners were congratulating
themselves that brick was indicated Mr.
Reid referred to a paragraph of the speci
fications which left no doubt that gal

make a naturally strong woman stronger
and healthier; they will make a naturally
weak, sickly woman weaker and more
eickly, and if indulged in to excess, may
result fatally. " .-v
A woman who suffers from weakness and
disease of the delicate and- important or-
gans â¢ distinctly feminine; cannot hope to
recover her general â¢ health through ath-
letics, so long as she remains locally weak.
A woman suffering in this way is unfitted
to bear the strain of .athletics just as much
as she is unfitted to bear the duties and
burdens of wifehood and motherhood.
There is a sure, safe, speedy and perma-
nent cure for all disorders of this descrip-
tion. It is Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescrip-
tion. It acts directly on the organs con-
cerned in wifehood and maternity, making
them strong and healthy and vigorous. It
soothes pain, allays inflammation, heals
ulceration and tones the nerves. It fits a
woman to indulge in, and be benefited by,
athletics. All good medicine stores sell it.
" Your valuable ' Favorite Prescription ' cured
me of female weakness and a catarrhal dis-
charge from the lining membrane of the special
parts," writes Mrs. T. H. Parker, of Brooklyn.

disease. One "Pellet" is a gentle laxa-
tive, and two a mild cathartic. Druggists â¢

STATESMEN
PLEAD FOR
PICQUART
Sensational Talk by
Deputies.
UPROAR IN FRENCH CHAMBER
SURLINDEN ACCUSED OF HAV
ING BROKEN HIS WORD.
Impassioned Speeches in Which, the
Dreyfus Scandal Is Reviewed
and Some Startling Alle
gations Made.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Nov. 28.â The Chamber of
Deputies was crowded to-day, much in
terest being taken in the announced in
tention of some of the members to in
terpellate the Government on the Pic
quart case. M. Paul Deschanel, Repub
lican, announced that he had received
a request to question the Government
regarding the proceedings, and the Pre
mier, M. Dupuy, proposed an immediate
discussion of the matter. M. Fourniere,
Socialist,; asked for an adjournment for
an hour and a half,, in order that the
Republican Deputies mi- ht be able to
consult with their colleagues in the
Senate regarding the adoption of a
common policy.
The Chamber rejected the motion to
adjourn by a vote of 252 to 244.
A Radical Deputy, M. Bps, opened the
discussion. He said that while there has
been some honesty in the Dreyfus pros
ecution, there had been nothing but
dishonesty in the Picquart affair.
These remarks caused an uproar.
Continuing, M. Bos detailed the his
tory of the Picquart "persecution," re
calling Colonel Picquart's exile to the
United Stales, and asked the Minister
of War, M. de Freycinet, why he had
permitted a court-martial to be sum
moned for December 12.
The Deputy also accused General Zur
linden, the Military Governor of Paris,
who, he said, had promised a revision
of the case, of having broken his word.
This caused another uproar.
M. Bos concluded by insisting that
the Government ought to postpone the
trial of Picquart by court-martial until
the decision of the Court of Cassation
in the revision of the Dreyfus trial is
made known.
This brought forth lively applause
from the majority of the Deputies.
M. Millerand, Radical Socialist, spoke
in a similar strain. He said it was ab
solutely necessary to postpone the Pic
quart court-martial, in order to avoid
the scandalous contradictions which
otherwise were likely to arise between
the verdicts of the court-martial and of
the Court <if Cassation.
The president of the Chamber at this
stage of the proceedings was frequent
ly obliged to intervene in order to
quiet the uproar on all sides.
M. Poincare, Republican, made an
impassioned speech, in the course of
which he said it was not necessary to
confound the army with a few impru
dent men. While the members of the
court-martial were above suspicion,
the prosecution of Picquart savored of
reprisal. (Applause.) Colonel Pic
quart's secret imprisonment, M. Poin
care further asserted, was beyond all
precedent, and there were guilty per
sons, he claimed, who were enjoying
scandalous immunity. (Applause.)
"There are other forgers besides
Picquart who ought to be prosecuted,"
exclaimed the Deputy. "These injus
tices will end by exasperating the na
tion."
M. Poincare. who was Minister of
Public Instruction in 1893-95, created a
sensation by adding:
"We were attacked for the Dreyfus
prosecution in 1894, but I learned of
the Dreyfus affair through the news
papers."
Tremendous applause and uproar fol
lowed this assertion.
M. Barthou, who was Minister of
Public Works in 1894, here interjected:
"I am ready to indorse the words of
M. Poincare, which are true."
This called forth more applause and
exclamations of "It is absurd," "It is
inconceivable."
Thereupon M. Poincare added: "The
only proof of Dreyfus' guilt in 1894
consisted of the bordereau. No Cabi
net Minister, or even the President of
the Council of Ministers, heard any
mention of the confessions Dreyfus is
alleged to have made to Captain Le
brun-Renault." (Applause.)
M. Cavaignac, the former Minister of
War, said: "General Mercier secured
those confessions."
General Mercier was Minister of
War at the time of the Dreyfus trial.
M. Poincare continued: "Captain
Lie Brun-Renault, when he was exam
ined by the President of the Council,
did not mention the Dreyfus confes
sion."
This statement caused applause to
break forth from all parts of the house,
during which M. Cavaignac tried to
speak, but was howled down, although
one Deputy shouted: "Let us hear the
hero of the forgery."
M. Poincare concluded by saying:
"Silence has weighed heavily upon me,
and I am now happy to have had the
opportunity to tell what I know of the
case." (Renewed applause.)
M. Cavaignac reasserted that Cap
tain Le Brun-Renault's evidence was
given to General Mercier. "His re
port exists," he exclaimed, amid up
roar and cries of "Date, date."
"But perhaps Captain Le Brun-
Renault has since^ retracted his admis
sions."
Shouts of surprise followed this sug
gestion. M. de Freycinetsaid: "The Gov
ernment, on assuming office, found the
proceedings pending. We have only one
anxiety, and that is to ascertain the
truth. We do not object to furnishing
the Court of Cassation with all the evi
dence availably excepting the evidence
involving the national defense. Both
the civil and the military courts are
fully equipped to deal with the re
spective cases, and, as all desire to ar
rive at the truth, it will be reached.
The Government asks tho chamber to
respect the independence of the law."
After an appeal from Millerand for
postponement of the Picquart court
martial, M. Dupuy. the Premier, de
clared that the Dreyfus affair "must
remain purely judicial, as the only
means of reaching the truth, which
may now be attained."
Referring to the statements of M.
Poincare, M. Dupuy asked why that

I Deputy had waited so long "before as- |
tonishing the chamber with his revela
tions."
"We decline to order a postponement
â  of the court-martial," said the Premier.
i "To give such an order, even if we had
the right, would be to strike a blow at
the principle of separation of the pub
i lie powers. It is not within the prov
1 ince of Parliament or (he Government
Ito adjust the connection which may
t exist between the Dreyfus and Picquart
cases. Our intervention would be cal
culated to hamper the work of the
| Court of Cassation. We will respect
the decision of the law. We are a Gov
ernment of law, and refuse to be a
Government of arbitrary measures."
(Prolonged cheers.)
The order of the day, approving the
statements of the Government respect-
I ing the principle of the separation of
the judicial and executive powers
was then adopted by a vote of 437 to
73. In the lobbies of the chamber M.
Dupuy's speech was interpreted as an
1 invitation of the Court of Cassation
i to ask for the production of the petit
| bleu and other documents in the
I Picquart case, which the Government
would immediately produce, thus in
! directly leading to a postponement of
a court-martial which the Government
I has refused to grant under duress. It
was held, also, that the Premier had
admitted the right of the Government
to intervene regarding General Zur
llnden's action, but had only refrained
from fear that intervention would be
misinterpreted.
An immense mass-meeting was held
this evening in favor of Colonel Pic
quart. Thousands of people, shouting
"Conspuez Rochefort," and "Conspuez â 
' Drument,'* marched to the Cherche- i
Midi Prison, where Picquart is confln- !
ed and cheered and demonstrated
thus on his behalf. The anti-Picquart-
I ites rallied, and there were several
j conflicts between the two bands.
The vote in the Chamber enables the
anti-Dreyfusites to sing a song of vic
tory, since the Dreyfusite demand was
for the Government to order the Pic
quart court-martial postponed. Never
theless, the whole debate served to ad- i
vance the cause of Dreyfus. M. Dupuy's !
speech is admitted in all hands to have j
been a masterpiece of statesmanship.
He did not deny that the Government
had power to intervene with General
Zurlinden, but explained that it would
be better for the Court of Cassation to
do so. He said that a fortnight ago the
Court of Cassation demanded the docu
ments concerning the Picquart affair.
At that time, for legal reasons, he
continued, only copies had been given.
Now, however, if the originals were de
manded by the court they would be
placed at Its disposal.
M. Rlbot, who was back of the de
mand for postponement, followed M.
Dupuy, and although he still contended
that the Government ought not to al
low itself to be a passive instrument In
General Zurlinden's hands, he had, per
force, to be content with M. Dupuy's
assurance.
Perhaps the most significant feature
of the debate after M. Poincare's reve
lation, which served to draw even closer
the bonds of suspicion surrounding
General Mercier, is the changing at
titude of the Chamber toward M. Ca
vaignac. The latter's speech before the
period of the Henry suicide was ac
cepted and placarded throughout the
country as proof of the guilt of Drey
fus. Now he is received with the howls
of the Deputies when he attempts to
justify his attitude.
The general belief is that the Court
of Cassation will now demand the Pic
quart dossier, thus delaying the court
martial.
Among the rumors current this even
ing is one that General Zurlinden. Mil
itary Governor of Paris, has already
resigned. There is also a report that
Colonel Rjcquart will be released on
bail.
Slight demonstrations continued in j

was nothing serious.
DREYFUS CABLES

PARIS, Nov. 28.â Mme. Dreyfus, the
wife of former Captain Alfred Dreyfus,

permission of the authorities, received
the following telegram from her hus

"I rejoice with all of you. My health
is morally and physically good."
WILLIAM INTERESTED
IN THE DREYFUS CASE
BERLIN, Nov. 28. â Is is learned from
an authoritative source that Colonel
Schwartzkopen, the former German
military attache at Paris, while sup
ping with EmpÂ»ror William at Pots
dam on Sunday, detailed the whole of
the inside history of the Dreyfus, Es
terhazy and Pioquart cases to his Ma
jesty, who contemplates taking some
action in the matter. The Imperial
Chancellor, Prince Hohenlohe, the Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, Baron yon Bue
low, and General yon Hahnke, the chief
of the Emperor's military Cabinet, will
be summoned to Potsdam this week to
discuss the advisability of an official
German pronouncement on the subject.
It is said that the Emperor, during his
recent tour, conversed with several per
sons about the Dreyfus case, and it is
added that the new points which he has
heard have prompted him to his present
action.

MORE THAN A HUNDRED
JAPS ARE DROWNED
TACOMA, Nov. 28.â A number of
Japanese fishing boats have been
wrecked along the coast of Saghalien
Island. More than a hundred lives
were lost there In October and several
other fishing vessels are missing, with
the probability in favor of their hav
ing also been wrecked. Fishing boats
along the Saghalien coast have a
capacity of about a hundred tons each
and carry crews of twenty-five to
thirty men, who make their living by
catching and salting salmon.
Eight fishing vessels left Saghalien
early in October for Yokohama. They
had scarcely left port when a terrific
storm arose. Four of them were blown
against the reefs and dashed to pieces,
only three out of 105 men being saved.
Three of these vessels were the Msyase,
Marue, Suyehiro Maru and Kotoku
Maru.
Heartrending scenes were witnessed
during the drowning of the brave
fishermen, who had toiled all summer
nearly in vain, as. this year's salmon
run was very light. Though driven
close to shore they believed themselves
safe until their boats were driven to
gether on an unknown reef. One boat
broke in two and the others were in
stantly swamped. The fishermen were
thrown into the angry waters and were
prevented from swimming ashore by
the terrific force of the breakers. The
fishing interests of Japan have suffered
a severe shock because this year and
several past have been*highly unprofit
able. . .

DIFFER ONLY ON
TWO QUESTIONS
Canadians and Ameri
cans Make Progress.
WILL END PELAGIC SEALING
CLOSE SEASON TO BE ESTAB
LISHED IN LAKE FISHERIES.
Alaskan Boundary and Reciprocity
the Propositions Upon Which
the Commissioners Are
Widely at Variance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 28.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: The Anglo-American Com
mission met for two hours to-day to
hear the report of the committee which
has been examining Canadian and
American experts relative to the value
of the Canadian sealing fleet in the
Bering Sea. Such progress has been
made in the discussion of many ques
tions under consideration that the Com
missioners expect that they will finish
negotiations by the holidays.
The Commissioners are widely at
variance over only two questions-
Alaskan boundary and reciprocity.
There is no longer any doubt that the
United States will end pelagic sealing
by buying out the Canadian sealers,
that the lake fisheries question will be
settled by the establishment of a close
season lasting during the spawning
period.
The sealing question is regarded as
good as settled and the only question
under discussion is the amount that
shall be paid to sealers to reimburse
them.
With respect to the Alaskan ques
tion, I was told that a dispute exists
as to the proper location of Hunters
Island. The Canadian Commissioners
assert that an island known by this
Government as Colemans Island is
Hunters Island, but the American
Commissioners disagree with them.
In connection with the Alaskan nego
tiations it is understood that the com
mission will define In the proposed
treaty the Portland Channel, so that
there may be no further discussion con
cerning that portion of the boundary.
With reference to reciprocity it is
practically conceded that it will be im
possible to draw up a genuine reciproc
ity clause because of Canada's refusal
to relinquish the 25 per cent differen
tial applied to American goods.
The commission has granted hearings
to former Representative Tawney re
specting lumber, and it is believed that
some agreement may be reached satis
factory to both governments.

PRECEDENTS FOR
PROPOSED POLICY
Constitutionality of the
"Open Door" Plan.
COMMERCE IN PHILIPPINES
MAY BE CONDUCTED ACCORDING
TO PRESIDENT'S VIEWS.
Past Decisions and Rulings Show
That Land Taken oy Conquest
May Be Regarded as For
eign Territory.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 28.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Presi
dent McKinley and his Cabinet have
gone very carefully into the question
of the constitutionality of the propo
sition to establish an "open door" pol-
icy of commerce in the Philippines, and
they have no doubt whatever of their
power under the constitution to do it
and of Congress to continue the system
in force.
Th'^y are supported very strongly in
their position by the decision of the Su
preme Court of the United States in the
case of Fleming et al. vs. Page. The
question at issue in this case was
whether Tampico, while in military oc
cupation of the United States in 1847,
ceased to be a foreign country within
the meaning of the revenue laws. In
the decision of the court, rendered by
Chief Justice Taney, it was first held
that territory held in military pos
session of the United States as a re
sult of conquest and not yet finally and
definitely held as United States terri
tory, must be treated as foreign terri
tory under the revenue laws. The
court then recited that after Florida
had been ceded to the. United States
and the forces of tr.e. United States had
taken possession of Pensacola, it was
decided by the Treasury Department
that goods imported from Pensacola
before an act of Congress was passed
converting it into a common district
and authorizing the appointment of a
collector, were liable to duty. That is,
that although Florida had, by cession,
actually become a part of the United
States and was in our possession, yet
under our revenue laws its ports must
be regarded as foreign until they were
established as domestic by an act of
Congress.
Undor this decision it is believed to
be clear that ports in territory held by
the United States can be considered as
foreign ports indefinitely as far as the
revenue and navigation laws of the
United States are concerned. If this
is true, it is clearly within the power
of the Government to establish for
such ports an entirely different tariff
system from that in the United States
and to enforce the United States tariff
on goods from those ports while collect
ing their tariffs on goods from the
United States. That is what will be
done under the "open door' policy as it
is proposed by the administration ta
have it ln force in the Philippines.

the matter of presenting business by
explaining the work that had been done
by the Code Commission and the neces
sity of having the new code printed be

Assemblyman Melick referred to the
that it was quite essential that re

NICHOLAS IS ARDENT
OVER DISARMAMENT
In an Interview the Czar Speaks Sadly of the
Attempt to Embitter the Relations of
England and Russia.
LONDON. Nov. 29.â The Paris correspondent of the Times says:
The Matin will publish Tuesday an interview of an English politician
with Emperor Nicholas. The interviewer, who especially remarked
the kindliness and modesty of the Czar'Â» demeanor, says he spoke
sadly and regretfully of the attempts to embitter the relations of
England and Russia. The conversation mostly turned, however, on
the disarmament of Europe, as to which the Czar spoke with the
utmost ardor, saying that he wanted a tangible result. His Majesty
suggested that the powers might bind themselves not to increase
their armaments for five years, at tho end of which they might meet
again to decide upon future action. They might also settle their at
titude in the event at menace or prospective hostilities. He sug
gested, as an example of possible action, that the recent Fashoda
incident might have been referred by England to the United States
and by France to Russia. If these failed to agree there might have
been recourse to an arbitrator. In any case delay would have made
for neace.
"The Czar protested," his interviewer says, "with great indigna
tion against the idea imputed to him of urging France and England
into conflict, characterizing it as monstrous. The Dreyfus case was
not mentioned during either of the two conversations, which the Eng
lish politician had with the Czar."
geles Times of this morning presented
the subject for the consideration of the
visiting legislators by printing a bitter
editorial asault upon the proposition to
send Colonel Dan Burns to the United
States Senate as the successor of Ste
phen M. White.
Referring to the statement that Col
onel Burns could be elected if he so de
sired, the Times says:
Of course, this is rot, pure and simple;
rot that is fantastic in its rottenness; rot
that is idiotic, inane stupid and asinine.
The people of ' alifornia will never con
sent to the election of a olitical boss
to the U. S. Senate, whose only claim
upon the office is that he has a fabulously
rich mine in Mexico, and consequently a
large "sack," and that he is a rather
clever worker of delegates to political
conventions. A man who nominates Ar
nolds to office through wicked combina
tions In conventions is not the sort of a
man to represent a great State in the
greatest body of law makers in the world.
and all this "talk about such a proposition
is simply making the situation ridiculous,
which is the undoubted purpose of the
people and the newspapers that en
gage in the conversation. When Califor
nia elects a man to the Senate he will be
one who will reflect credit upon the State
and its people, and not, on the contrary,
quite the reverse.
The editorial was the subject of con
siderable comment among the legisla
tors. They all had their Senatorial
preferences, but still they could not re
frain from discussing the situation as
viewed from parlous standpoints. Mead
and Meserve, Democrats, will vote for
White. Bulla has eight votes from this
county and Grant has six in Southern
California. Merritt of Santa Barbara
and Greenwell of Ventura have as yet
expressed no preference.
TERRIFIC POWDER
EXPLOSION IN HAVANA
Many Boys and Girls Employed in
Handling Cartridges Killed
and Injured.
HAVANA. Nov. 28.â A terrific explosion
occurred here this morning, resulting, ac
cording to such news as is at hand, in a
dreadful loss of life. The explosion oc
curred on the Avenue Infanta, between
the Santa Claxa and Reina batteries.
Many boxes of powder were stored In a
private house, which also contained five
rooms full of Mauser and other cartridges.
The careless handling of one of the boxes
of powder or of one of the boxes of car
tridges caused the explosion, which killed
or more or less seriously injured thirty
eight persons.
The presence of such a large quantity
of cartridges, known to have been brought
recently from the artillery depotâ in an
out of the way house, where they were
stored roof high â has not been explained.
Most of those employed in emptying the
cartridges, evidently their only duty on
the premises, were boys and girls under
17 years cf a^c. and they formed the
greatest proportion of the victims. The
employment of children in such a dan
gerous occupation and the existence of
such a large quantity of explosives within
the city limits are both In contravention
of th* 1 municipal regulations.
Whether there may have been some ul
terior motive In storing these explosives
there cannot be answered, but the
casualty suggests the probability that
there may have been other similar do
posits where the localities are unknown to
the authorities. Senor de f'astro, the
civil governor of Havana, has stat-ioned
a guard over the exploded powder-house
and an Investigation Into the affair has j
been ordered.
Nobody was killed outright by the ex- j
plosion, but three of the Injured died this
afternoon and the condition of most of '
the others is more or less critical. At j
least fifteen are not expected to live.
Death of Mrs. Mary Haweis.
LONDON, Nov. 28.â Mrs. Mary Haweis,
wife of Rev. Hugh Reginald Haweis, in
cumbent of St. James, Marylebone, Lon
don, and long and favorably known in
philanthropic, artistic and Journalistic
circles, is dead.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1898.
HEAVY LOSS
OF SAN LUIS
OBISPO COUNTY
Tax Collector Find
ley's Shortage.
MAY EXCEED FIFY THOUSAND
DISCOVERY MADE IN A HASTY
INVESTIGATION.
Trace -of the Fugitive Official's Move
ments Lost After His Ar
rival in San Fran
i cisco.
I Special Dispatch to The Call.
IAN LUIS OBISPO, Nov. 28.â For
ne days it has been suspected that
unty Tax Collector S. M. Findley
had lied because of shortage. He left
here on the ISth inst. saying he would
Ilect licenses in the eastern part of
county. He was not seen in that
tion and the Fidelity and Deposit
npany of Maryland, which held his
id, was notified. A special agent ar
ml Sunday evening and this morn
the safe in the office was broken
n by county officials and there was
nd missing $11,837 37. The suppo
sition is that much more is gone.
Findley stopped at Santa Margarita
I Friday and went on to San Fran
>co on Saturday, the 19th inst. He
xchased two valises in this city bo
re leaving. One was a small one,
obably intended for coin and cur
ncy. Findley since having been ap
inted to office in December, 1897, has
en drinking heavily and playing
ckel-in-the-slot machines around
wn.
The Board of Supervisors met this
ening to take action. Its examina
tion was hasty and incomplete, but it
seemed to indicate a shortage of about
$55,000. The accounts will now be aud
ited accurately and until examination
is completed the exact shortage can
not known.
Fin'flley was an old resident of the
county and hitherto has borne an ex
cellent character. He was one of the
leading men in the creation of the Pop
ulist party in this county and for the
first two years of its existence was the
.chairman of its County Committee. His
first reward in the shape of office was
his appointment by the Board of Su
pervisors as Tax Collector to fill the
unexpired term of George W. Ramage,
who died a year ago. Soon after as
suming control of the office he began
drinking heavily and gambling, and
the attention of Thomas Barrett, local
agent of his bondsmen, the Fidelity am
Deposit Company, was attracted.
Findley had expected the fusion norn
ination and re-election to his office, bu
was disappointed, and that fact doub
less precipitated his flight. He wen
away without exciting suspicion,
being his custom to take trips about th
county to serve the convenience of 1
cense taxpayers. To acquaintances a
the train on which he left on Friday h
casually stated that he was taking
trip of that nature. He stopped a
Santa Margarita, the first point north
of here, evidently to carry out this de
ception, but when he next boarded the
northbound train he went through to
San Francisco, where he disappeared.
A few days later his absence reawak
ened suspicion, and Barrett notified the
officers of the Fidelity Company. There
was mu^h telephoning and telegraph-
Ing, but nothing could be learned of his
whereabouts.
Findley leaves an estimable family,
apparently In entire ienorance of his
movements and in deer> distress over
the shame which has overtaken them
through his act. The office is in the
hands of his deputies, Messrs. Nesblt
and Scott, and the receipt of revenues
goes on without interruption, except
that occasioned by the experts of the
Board of Supervisors and the Fidelity
Company, who are laboriously engaged
in the big volumes which conceal the
defalcation.
BUFFALO'S ENGINEERS
DECLARED INCOMPETENT
Keport of the Naval Court of Inquiry
on the Damages to the

WASHINGTON, Nov. 25.-The Navy
Department to-day made public the re
port of the court of Inquiry, of which
Commander John McGowan was presi
dent, appointed to Investigate and deter
mine the responsibility for the break
down of the machinery of the cruiser J?uf
falo when only a few days out from New
York on her way to Join Admiral Dewey's

The report found that the accidents
were due to neglect and incompetency
on the part of the engineers on the ship
and recommended that Chief Engineer
Frederick C. Brigg be reprimanded and
that Assistant Engineers Frederick G.
Simondl, William H. Mackay and Thomas
Rodger, who have only temporary ap

vice. Assistant Secretary Allen modified
the findings so far as to retain the three
assistants and transferred them to other

TURQUOISE KING
OF THE JARILLAS
FOULLY SLAIN
Mexican Murders A. J.
De Mules.
QUARRELED OVER WAGES
TWO BULLETS FIRED AT THE
MINE-OWNER.
Tragic Passing of a Man Who Pos
sessed a Limitless fortune in
New au-exican Turquoise
Fields.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EL PASO, Tex.. Nov. 28.â A. J. de
Mules, known far and wide as the
"Turquoise King of the Jarillas," was
murdered in cold blood this morning at
his camp in the Jarillas, in New Mexico,
fifty miles north of this city, while
seated at his breakfast table, by a Mex
ican laborer with whom he had had a
dispute about a settlement of the lat
ter's wages. The murderer used a six
shooter. One bullet penetrated the vic
tim's neck and another his back, kill
ing him instantly. The assassin at
tempted to escape after having wreaked
his vengeance upon the mine owner,
but was pursued and surrounded by
American employes armed with Win
chesters, who forced him to surrender.
After the arrest of the murderer the
entire force of workmen employed at
the mines endeavored to lynch the pris
oner. Their intention was frustrated
by guards who threatened them with
AVinchesters. The guards were as
sisted in the protection of the prisoner
by several railroad men who hastened
to the mines from the railway station
as soon as they learned of the killing.
The prisoner was brought to El Paso
to-night and r.ow occupies a cell at the
County Jail here. He is morose and re
fuses to talk. The corpse of his victim
arrived on the same train and will be
buried at Las Cruces, New Mexico.
âº A. J. de Mules was well known in El
Paso and his sudden death and the
manner in which he was killed shocked
the entire community. His famous tur
quoise mines, five miles from Jarillas,
on the White Oaks Railway, had
brought him into prominence in all
parts of the country. When assassin
ated he was on the threshold of a reali
| zation of the dream and ambition of his
] life, which was to possess a mine of
| fabulous richness. To that end he had
; schemed and toiled for years, and un
dergone untold hardships and priva
tions. In the turquoise mines of New-
Mexico he had at last found the means
of gaining an immense fortune. Al
ready stones from these mines had been
sold which netted the owner an amount
bordering on $50,000 and the undevel
oped wealth was considered limitless.
Kut little is known of De Mules" past
history. He was born in Jefferson
County, New . York, thirty-eight years
a^o and was a resident of Santa Fe.
N. M., in 1887. It is believed he served
as an enlisted man in the United States
army in Colorado prior to that. He
was a barber by trade and located in
Las Cruces, N. M., ten years ago. He
subsequently became a prospector and
speculator in mining property, but was
not successful until a few years ago.
Three years ago he became convinced
that the turquoise claims in the JariHas
north of this city were of great value,
but he had no money to develop them.
He persuaded J. A. Baird of this city
to supply the necessary capital and the
mines subsequently proved to be a veri
table bonanza. One shipment of tur
quoise therefrom to Tiffany of New
York netted De Mules $10,000.
Recently A. H. Richards, a jeweler of
this city, had on exhibition in his win
dow a collection of stones from De
Mules' mine that attracted much atten
tion. Among them were the largest and
most beautiful turquoises ever seen in
this city. One of the stones on exhibi
tion was the largest ever cut in the
United States.
COLONEL JEWETT
MAY LOSE HIS JOB
Relieved as Judge Advocate General
at Manilaâ He Is Likely to
Be Mustered Out.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.S.â Judge Advo
cate General Charles L.. Jewett has been
importuning the War Department to be
relieved from duty at Manila, and al
though his request has been granted, as
previously stated in these dispatches, it
is doubtful whether Colonel Jewett will
remain in the service. His friends, who
have been working here in his behalf, are
fearful it is the intention of the depart
ment to muster him out altogether in
stead of assigning turn to duty elsewhere.
CALIFORNIA FRUIT SEIZED.
Condemned in Germany for Having
the San Jose Scale.
BERLIN. Nov. 28.â 1t is officially an
nounced to-day that San Jose scale was
found in five consignments of California
pears and nectarines received In Germany
during the month of November. The
fruit was seized, condemned and ordered
re-exported. It is feared this will have
the effect to check, if not stop, the im
portation of American fruits.
FATE OF WALTER ROSSER.
It Will Be Determined by the Jury
. This Morning.
The fate of Walter Rosser. who, on the !
13th of last September, shot and killed
Henry Hllderbrand in the Spreckels
Market, will be determined this morning. |
Yesterday afternoon shortly before 5
o'clock the charge to the jury was con
cluded, and it retired to deliberate on a I
verdict. As it did not agree on the first I
ballot Judge Wallace ordered It locked
up for the night.
When the case was called yesterday
morning Frank J. French, P. A McNa- ]
mara and Owen E. Heffernan were called :
in the order named. All agreed that the
prisoner appeared oblivious of his sur
roundings and the crime he had com
mitted. The examination of these wit
nesses concluded. Acting District Attor
ney Walter Hlnklc made the opening ar
gument for the prosecution. He was fol
lowed by General Barnes for the defense,
who made an eloquent plea for mercy for
his client, insisting that Rosser had been
drugged and was not accountable for his
actions when he fired the fatal shot.
Judge Wallace, in his charge to the
Jury, laid special stress on the law re
garding intoxication as an excuse for
crime. He instructed the jury that in
event it found that the prisoner was
guilty of voluntarily becoming intoxicated
he should be held for the crime of mur
der, but if it was determined that some
noxious principle had been added to the
wine which the young man drank on the
night of the murder and that it resulted
in a complete deadening of his senses then !
he should be acquitted. The court fur- j
ther instructed that even if it was found
that poison had been administered with- |
out the prisoners knowledge, and did not !
result in completely clouding his mind i
and the jury believed that he was aware
of the fact that he was taking a human
life, although suffering from the effects i
of some drug, he should be held. i
PREDICTED THE
DEFEAT OF SPAIN
Admiral Cervera Pro
tested Against War.
NO CHANCE ON THE SEAS
SHIPS OF THE DONS TOTALLY
OUTCLASSED BY OURS.
Surprise and Astonishment of the
Officers of His Doomed Squadron
Over the Orders to Sail
for Cuba,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â The Navy
Department to-day published, through
the office of Naval Intelligence, the
"views" of Admiral Cervera regarding
the Spanish navy in the late war.
Captain Clover, the chief intelligence
officer, explains that this is a reprint of
a number of letters published in La
Epoca of Madrid, on the sth of the
present month. The letters are dated
from before the war up to May 5. They
were written by Cervera in protest
against Spain rushing into, war in the
face of certain defeat, due to the naval
strength of the United States, and the
unpreparedness of the Spanish navy.
Cervera writes:
I ask myself if it is right for me to keep
silent, and thereby make myself an ac
complice id adventures which will surely
cause the total ruin of Spain. And for
what purpose? To defend an island
which was ours, but which belongs to us
no more, because even if we should not
lose it by right in the war we have lost it
In fact/and with it all wealth and
an enormous number of young men, vic
tims of the climate and bullets, in the
defense of what is now no more than a
romantic idea. Furthermore, I believe
that this opinion of mine should be known
to the Queen and by the whole Council of
Ministers. 1 have deemed it my duty to
express my opinions to the proper author
ities clearly and without beating about
the bush. Now let orders be given to me;
I will carry them out with energy and
decision; 1 am ready for the worst.
Captain Clover says Spain had ne
glected her navy, and Cervera shows
that it was imprudent for her to at- i
tempt war against a superior
naval power. Taking up some of the
vessels in detail, in a letter written in
January, he shows how the Vizcaya
carried defective guns; how the Carlos
V was a failure because of lack of
power; and how the Cataluna, begun
more than eight years before, was still
incomplete. And then he predicted
that a conflict would be disastrous to
Spain.
In a letter written in February, the
admiral speaks of the Colon having no
guns; of other vessels being defective;
of the inability of the fleet to coal at
Cadiz; of their being obliged to go with
half rations, and finally their having
no charts of the American seas. He
says that the eight principal vessels on
the Havana station are worn out and
that, taking things as they are, the
Spanish naval force, compared with
that of the United States, is in propor
tion of one to three. In such condi
tions a campaign, he writes, would be
disastrous if not an offensive one, and
all that could be done in an offensive
way would be to make some raids with
a few fast vessels.
The admiral points, to the futility of
attempting to blockade the United
States ports, and asks how the Spanish
navy would repair, even should they
win a great victory, without resources.
He said:
It would be foolish to deny that what
we may reasonably expect is defeat,
which may be glorious, but, all the same,
defeat which would cause us to lose the
islands in the worst possible manner.
â¢ â¢ â¦ Only in case we could count
on pome powerful ally could we aspire to
1 obtain a satisfactoroy result.
The admiral refers to the Spanish Pa
i cific force as not able to afford even a
shadow of resistance to the American
naval force. Further on he speaks of
the war as at last in sight and laments
the incomplete state of the Spanish ves
| sels. But, after all, he says that he is
! glad that the end is coming and is pre
pared to do his duty. He is on record
as protesting against the idea of send
ing the little torpedo-boat flotilla to
Cuba, pointing out that a naval defeat
for Spain would precipitate the loss of
Cuba. He speaks of the surprise and
| astonishment experienced by all of the
I officers of his squadron on . receiving
j orders from Spain to sail from Cape
Verde for Cuba, inasmuch as they had
| united in pointing out the condition of
! the ships. Says the admiral:
With an easy conscience Igo to the
sacrifice, but I cannot understand the
decision of the navy general officers
against my opinions.
The last letter in the series is one from
Admiral Villamil of Cervera's squad
ron, addressed directly to Sagasta,
pointing out that the sacrifice of the
Spanish naval forces "will be as cer
tain as it will be useless and fruitless
for the termination of the war."
MANY VOLUNTEERS
TO BE MUSTERED OUT
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â The War
Department, in view of the assurances
that a treaty of peace will be signed,
is arranging to muster out more troops.
It is probable that from 30,000 to 40.000
volunteers will be disbanded as soon as
selections of regiments can be made.
There has been quite a demand for the
return of volunteers from Manila, but
no troops wlil be brought from the
Philippines unless they are replaced by
others. With the acceptance of the
American terms by the Spanish Com
missioners, any further possibilities of
renewal of hostilities is past, and the
only necessity now for troops is to gar
rison the islands and preserve the peace
of our new possessions. It is probable
that the 30,000 or 40,000 men mustered
out will include a large number organ
ized for service in Cuba. The force at
Manila will be reduced when General
Otis reports affairs in a quiet state in
the Philippines.
LOUD'S POSTAL BILL
AGAIN COMING UP
Having Compromised With Publish
ers, the Author Hopes for
its Passage.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â Congressman
Loud has decided to bring up during the
coming session his bill regulating second
class mail matter. This is well known
all. over the country as the Loud bill.
It was voted down at the last session,
though not defeated outright. It was
merely "tabled"; therefore it will not be
necessary to introduce a new bill and have
it reported to the House from the Com
mittee on Postofflces and Postroads. It
will be called up again, and Mr. Loud nas
strong hopes it will be passed this time,
for the opposition to it last session came
chiefly from the publishers of periodicals,
and Mr. Loud believes he has reached an
understanding with these publishers
whereby they will offer no opposition to
the bill, which will be modified without
detracting from its merit. The bill seeks
to put the postal service on a better basis
by deriving additional revenue from mat
ter which is now transported in the mails
at a loss to the Government.

DRIVING ROD BREAKS
ON A LOCOMOTIVE
Disaster on the Southern Pacific, With
a Miraculous Absence of
Casualties. -
WOODLAND, Nov. 28.â Train 50. run
ning between Sacramento and Oroville,
met with a serious accident when nearing
the end of the trip this morning. It is mar
velous that it did not result in the loss of
life. Engine 1259, in charge of Engineer
Young and Fireman Schneldeer, was
hauling the train. While crossing the
first trestle west of Washington the big
driving rod on the right side of the en
gine broke about half way between the
two driving wheels. The forward half
of the rod in revolving stripped the
branch pipe, leaving an aperture of
about two inches through which the
steam rushed with a roar that could be
heard for more than a mile.
Engineer Young immediately applied
the emergency air brakes, and the next
moment the aft half of the broken rod
struck the footboard, reducing it to
splinters. It crashed through the right
side of the cab, throwing the engineer
from his seat to the opposite side of the
cab and pitching the box on which the
engineer was seated down the grade on
the left side.
The train ran about 200 feet before It
could be stopped. Every time one of the
ends of the broken rod struck a tie it
was shivered Into fragments. The noise
of the escaping steam and the cloud it
made about the engine left the passen
gers in doubt as to what had happened.
Conductor Irwin expressed the opinion
that the boiler had exploded, but re
lieved the anxiety of the passengers by
the announcement that both the engi
neer and fireman were safe.
Conductor Irwin hastened to the Sac
ramento yard, and in about fifteen min
utes returned with the switch engine.
In the meantime the steam had about all
escaped, the broken rod was removed, the
fragments of the wreck picked up and
the disabled engine and train were haul
ed into the Sacramento yard.
The escape of Engineer Young is con
sidered but little less than miraculous.
He was badly shaken and complains of
pains in the back, but fortunately no
bones were broken and his Injuries are
not considered serious.

THE NEW POSTOFF'CE.
S~* ONGRESSMAN LOUD struck a responsive
( chord in the breast of San Rrancisco when he
announced upon his arrival at Washington that
he intended to ascertain why work is not proceeding
more rapidly upon the Postoffice building at the cor
ner of Seventh and Mission streets. That structure is
not in Mr. Loud's district, but the people of the
Fourth Congressional will appreciate anything he may
do for them. They have long been represented in
Congress by a gentleman who does not bother about
such little things as postoffices.
Unless Mr. Loud or somebody else stirs up the
Treasury Department in the matter of this building,
probably the present generation of San Franciscans
will never live to see it constructed. Work upon the
Temple of Justice at Kearny and Washington streets
is proceeding with lightning-like speed compared with
that upon, the new Postoffice, and yet the former has
been snailish in its slowness.
The Postoffice lot was purchased by the Govern
ment in iÃg>3. Nearly four years were consumed in
"inspecting" it. A number of expeditions were sent
from Washington with instructions to ascertain
whether or not the stories of the owners of rival sites
that there wa-s a bog under the lot were true; and then
the War Department engineers tackled the proposi
tion. Several carloads of earth were sent East to be
"analyzed" and the lot was drilled full of artesian
wells with a view of unearthing the bog. Finally
work was commenced upon the foundation. After a
year of delay, during which a contractor has been
convicted of working his men more than eight hours
a day, the walls for the superstructure have been com
pleted.
It seems to us that five years is quite a long time
to consume in the preliminary work of "inspecting"
the site and building the foundation of the Postoffice.
It strikes us also that it is about time somebody
stirred, the Treasury Department up to greater activ
ity. Congressman Loud can render the people of this
city no more efficient sen-ice than in demanding to
know the causes of delay and in requesting that fur
ther procrastination be dispensed with. The Post
office ought to be finished before the end of the
century, but unless somebody takes hold of it and
makes the Government more, the twentieth century
wili expire before a letter is mailed at the new loca
tion. -.- . :
One hundred years will not suffice to settle all the
disputes that will arise over the building if the treas
ury officials are left to themselves. They have occu
pied five j'ears in disposing of a rumor about a bog
under the lot, and do not yet seem to be satisfied that
it was a. joke.
PUGILISM KNOCKED OUT.
â¢""T""* HE make-believe blows struck by Corbett and
Sharkey the other night were not designed to
harm. They were exchanged by an understand
ing as definitely arranged as the details of a horse
trade. The men knew that the purse was to be divided
equally /.between themselves after the club had secured
a share. Neither had any object in inflicting bruises
on the other.. Indeed, to have done so would have
marred their pleasant relations and jolted the honor
which prevails among thieves. The public, a collective
sucker, had been: selected as the victim. It always had
responded to the chance to be bled by the mock
fighter. â â¢â¢ â 
However, the baby blows given and taken have had
the effect of knocking pugilism out at least for a time.
The public does not like to be taken in by methods
so palpable; It wants its gold bricks artistically
gilded. This is not a lofty view. If pugilists really
fought they would flourish; but as frauds who will not
fight they arouse antagonism.
Perhaps, it is a reflection upon morals and intelli
gence, but it is true that the brutality of pugilism
would not kill it. The fact that it was breeding a class
of thugs, supporting a lot of vagrants, sustaining
gamblers and drawing youth into bad society and
reckless habit? would all be passed over. But the
pugilist has taken to open swindling and to laughing
at his dupes. There is a limit to human endurance.
Alas and alas! the pugilist may ultimately have to go
tc work or starve.
Corbett says he is crushed by the charges of con
nivance in the crookedness which netted him $15,000.
However, his talking apparatus escaped uninjured,
and the size of the purse will tend to heal his bruises.
At this price per crush Corbett may be considered. a
standing candidate for- crushing.
It may be well to state that while President Craig
has gone East he has not taken the Chamber of Com
merce with him.
WOR SPIRIT DECLINING.
! "T^HE reorganization of the National Guard by the
refilling of its regiments is reported by the
* officers to go slowly because of the decline of
military enthusiasm.
This does not imply any lack of the defensive and
offensive spirit which springs to the country's rescue in
a crisis. That spirit has been shown by our people in
the Revolution, the Mexican and Civil wars and in the
late contest with Spain. But it shows that Americans
do not care much for soldiering for its own sake. The
decline of that form of enthusiasm is also largely due
to the rigors of service in the tropics. After all is
said about official neglect and lack of sanitary equip
ment, the fact remains that no official zeal and ef
ficiency and no perfection of hospital and medical
equipment can arrest the ravages of the tropical cli
mate among troops not fitted by racial resistance for
life under a vertical sun.
Visitors to Hawaii who have briefly sojourned there
at the most favorable season have written volumes
about the Paradise of the Pacific. But our troops
quartered there under the most favorable con
ditions have found it the reverse of a para
dise. They have been subject to forms of
sickness which, while amenable to treatment in
the temperate zone, are as fatal and irresistible as
bullets in the tropics. A still sadder story comes from
Manila, and Cuba ranks in the reports as a pest island.
The worst feature of it is that a tropical climate, if it
spare life, leaves a constitution broken beyond repair.
All this information is not to be had in published re
ports nor in the news columns of the press. It comes
in the sad letters written home by the men who suffer.
The prospect of a great army needed to garrison these
tropical posts, and certainly in the Philippines to
conquest the natives, who will fight against further
colonial subjection, deters men from enlistment in the
regulars and from entering a National Guard which
may at any moment be again called to arms, not to
fight Spain but the people whom we delivered from
Spanish rule.
These signs must be wisely studied by our public
men. They are indications of the popular will and
feeling which cannot be ignored. They enforce the
lesson which The Call has kept before its readers from
the beginning.
That lesson has seemed at times to be forgotten by
commercial bodies, which seem to think that we can
compel trade by guns and the sword. It is true that
we can conquest the ten millions of Filipinos, as we
can the Cubans, for our Government has the great
power of conscription, by which it can make an army
of eight or ten millions of men. But it will be a sad
day when the republic forces its citizens into the ranks
of an army of conquest to overrun an unwilling
people.
We cannot surrender the conviction that the path
I out of the situation to true greatness lies in securing
I such coaling and naval stations as will serve our pur
' pose and the bestowal of sovereignty upon the people
i we have delivered from Spain, the payment of the
cost and retirement to our own borders. Then the
I money and energy which will be required to carry out
; an imperial military policy can be devoted to our own
â  peaceful development, and the world will fear and
â  respect us to a degree that can never be caused by any
I feat 3 of arms we may achieve as a military republic.
THE MINISTERING ONGEL.
OUT of the fearful tragedy of the wreck of the
T. C. Walker there have come several proofs of
heroism that lighten the gloom of the calamity.
The promptness with which the crew and the passen
gers recovered from the shock of the explosion and
hastened to the relief of the victims showed that the
higher instincts of humanity were not confined to one
or two but were shared by nearly all whom chance
had gathered into company for the trip.
There was a conspicuous fortitude shown by Cap
tain John Tulan, who, though imprisoned in his state
room and so badly scalded by the steam that when
rescued pieces of his flesh came off with his clothing,
bore the pain without a groan and carried his agony
heroically until death relieved him. Not less heroic
was that poor Italian who, though burned severely, re
fused to give his name, saying his wife might be
alarmed, and he wished to be the first to break the
news to her.
In this catastrophe, however, as in so many others, the
: chief praise for fortitude and for helpfulness belongs
!to woman. To the burned and scalded sufferers of
i the explosion the coming of Mrs. Frances Robinson
{ of this city, one of the passengers on the steamer,
I was that of a veritable ministering angel. Skilled in
I the care of the sick, she knew what to do for the
j victims, and she did it with a promptness that made
! it. doubly efficacious.
This brave woman, roused from her sleep by the
explosion and hearing the cries of the injured,
hastened from her stateroom into the night without
stopping to even put on her slippers. In her night
robe and in bare feet she went to the scene of the
wreck and at once took charge of the work of relief.
Under her directions flour and oil were obtained and
bandages applied to the burned flesh of the agonized
sufferers, their pains eased as much as possible and in
many cases their lives saved.
Mrs. Robinson did not work alone. She was cor
: dially and bravely assisted by other women among the
passengers. With swift hands and loving hearts of
1 gentle helpfulness they worked, binding up the fearful
burns while the cold morning winds swept around
them unheeded. It was another illustration amid the
j wreck of that awful catastrophe of the old story of
woman's service, embodied in the immortal words:
j "When pain and anguish wring the brow, a minister
ing angel thou."
AN ERA OF EXPOSITIONS.
rOR the people of the Eastern States the next
five years are to be prolific of expositions.
They are to cover every variety of industrial
activity and many of them are to be conducted on a
scale of great magnitude. Moreover, all the larger
ones expect liberal appropriations from the General
Government.
Without counting the exposition movements in
smaller cities, the projects now under way include a
Commercial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1899, a
Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1900, a Uni
versal Exposition in New York in 1001, a Cincinnati
Exposition in 1902 and a World's Fair at St. Louis
in 1903.
It will be seen that all of these projects have their
home in the Eastern section of the country. There
i i but one of them west of the Mississippi and none
west of the Missouri. The promoters will co-operate
with one another in getting appropriations from the
General Government, and there can be no doubt that
each will be munificently assisted.
While the^se expositions are going on the West will
help to pay the bills, help to make the exhibits and
help to patronize the expositions when opened. To
the people of the East, however, nearly all the bene
fits will accrue. We shall have, it is true, an oppor
tunity at each to make a display of our resources and
our industries, but beyond that our gam will be little.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, .NOVEMBER 29, 1898.
Of course, the East is not to be blamed for this
seeming unfairness to the West. It is not their fault
if we also do not get - an appropriation for an exposi
tion. The Government is as willing to help us as it
is to help New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis. If
we desire an exposition and an appropriation we have
only to follow the example of Eastern cities and ob
tain them by working for them.
It is not to the credit of the great West that her
cities and her States are so comparatively stagnant in
respect to such enterprises while the East is so active
and progressive. In the five years' cycle of exposi
tions there should be at least one great event of the
kind on the Pacific Coast. The new era of prosperity
dawns as brightly for us as for the East, and in the
glow of its radiance our light should shine as brightly
as that of the older States.
It rests with San Francisco to determine whether
the Pacific Coast shall have a great exposition or not.
No other city on the coast is large or rich enough to
undertake one of a magnitude approaching that of the
more splendid expositions to be held in the East.
Nor do we lack reasons for venturing upon such an
enterprise within the next few years. The develop
ment of Pacific Ocean commerce is in itself suf
ficiently notable to render it worth while for us to
invite the countries of Asia, of Australasia and of
South America to an exposition at a city which is
destined to be the metropolis of that commerce.
THE WRECK Of THE WALKER.
WITH the wreck of the T. C. Walker it appears
we are confronted with another of those direful
catastrophes that are set down as accidents for
which no one is to blame. From statements made by
those who are in a position to know most about the
matter, it would seem that everything was all right
with the boiler, and the explosion was either pure
cussedness on the part of the steam or the direct work
of the devil.
The average man who does not believe in special
diabolisms or in the perversity of inanimate forces will
hardly be able to rid his mind of the conviction that
the disaster was the result of human carelessness.
Either the boiler was too weak to carry the normal
pressure of steam required to propel the boat or else
the pressure was made abnormally high. We are as
sured, however, that neither of these things was a
factor in the case. The boilers, we are told, were
comparatively new, and had been recently tested and
approved by the Government Inspectors and regis
tered for a pressure of 170 pounds. We are further
told that at the time the accident occurred the gauge
registered a pressure of but 150 pounds.
The solution of the problem will have to be left to
official inquiry, but public opinion should demand
that the inquiry be careful and exhaustive. Most
accidents to modern machinery, when scientifically
investigated, are found to be the results of negligence
on the part of operatives or parsimony on the part of
proprietors. Either the machine was badly run or it
was a bad machine.
The fixing of responsibility in cases of such acci
dents tends to prevent their occurrence in future. An
important duty- is, therefore, imposed upon officials
charged with the investigation. During the early part
of the year a good many wrecks occurred among the
vessels fitted out for the Alaskan trade, but a more
rigid investigation into one or two such disasters
stopped that form of criminal recklessness. A similar
vigor of investigation into this accident might have an
equally good result on the river shipping.
THE fact has been mentioned heretofore â and pos
sibly may be mentioned again â that all-the-year
round racing is a lure and a menace to public
morals. Incidentally, it is absolutely destructive of the
integrity of a sport in which breeding and skill once
had a chance. Now it is a gambling game; nothing
more. The man who ventures money on the outcome
of a contest merely guesses as to which horse has been
slated to win.
It is the moral aspect of the question, however,
which appeals, much as we may regret to see a sport
once reputable made into the means whereby the
public is fleeced. So great is the temptation afforded
by the constant presence of the chance to bet that
many are unable to resist. They read of fabulous win
nings and are fired by the fallacious notion that for
tune may smile on them. They give their hard-earned
money to the bookmaker. He thrives. They want to
get even, and if the dollars are lacking they borrow,
beg or steal. Women become infatuated with the idle
dream of riches, and for the sake of playing neglect
their homes, waste the funds supplied by unsuspect
ing husbands and jeopardize their own reputations.
Often they become involved in open disgrace, for
sooner or later comes exposure, while more than one
domestic tragedy may be traced directly to the passion
for gaming, awakened and nurtured by the ever-pres
ent opportunity.
One of the duties of the Legislature will be to reg
ulate racing, to limit the season and to crush the pool
room, which is the iniquitous adjunct of an iniquitous
scheme for bunkoing the public.
An evening paper states gravely that it had already
exposed the crookedness of the ferry depot job and
that the present showing of experts is in the nature of
a chestnut. The important features of this declaration
are â first, that it is not true and, second, that if it were
true nobody would have known it. What facilities has
the Bulletin for exposing anything? To see it is a
calamity, to read it an accident and to believe it an
evidence of paresis.
The man Brandes. accused of the murder of his own
daughter, is said to devote much of his time to prayer;
but if his idea is to save himself discomfort he would
better direct his time to gathering funds for some
lawyer whose devotion to the high calling of defeating
the law is beyond question.
Naturally enough, the Supreme Court granted a
new trial to a convicted man upon the showing that
the trial Judge had not been present throughout the
proceedings. People are prone to think that a felon
has too many privileges, but they do not wish to see
him deprived of any rights.
Carlists declare they will rise against Spain upon
the signing of a treaty of peace with the United
States. Such a statement might have been alarming
ac one time, but as a bluff decrepit for usage It has lost
its power to strike terror.
A San Rafael man has been fined $io for an attempt
to kill his wife and daughter. At this rate he can
afford to make the effort as often as the notion may
seize him.
Sharkey's manager intimates kindly that Corbett
may have another chance at his man. But where are
the idiots who would pay the gate money?
According to one foreigit paper, the notorious
Esterhazy has sailed for this country. Let us hope
for the best. Papers sometimes err.
Aguinaldo still seems to cling to the idea that he is
a bigger man than Otis.
CHECK THE RACING.
A RAILROAD IN LAKE COUNTY.
Editor of The Call: Very much has been said and written of Lake Coun
ty. Comparisons have been made with the most attractive and extensive!*
patronized pleasure resorts in other sections of our country, as well as in Eu
rope. Her endless variety of mineral springs perpetually gushing fortn
waters laden with health-restoring properties constitute a real sanitarium.
Her balmy atmosphere, fresh from the Pacific Ocean seventy-five miles
away, rolling over the mountain forests of pine and redwood, is tempered
to the most delicate touch of tHe sensitive invalid, imparting new courage,
vigor and life. Her glorious sunshine, unobstructed by the fogs that pre
vail in many places on the Pacific Coast, is met by the continued evapo
ration of the waters of Clear Lake, supplying the atmosphere with the
needed humidity for easy and delightful inhalation, bracing up the wasting
diseased bodies of those in sanrch of health.
The beautiful landscapes spread around Clear Lake present scenes of at
traction to the eyes that admire beauties in nature, unsurpassed perhaps by
any section of our whole country.
Much more could be said without exhausting the theme or even squint
ing at exaggerationâ in fact, others have elaborated in a marked degree, and
yet the half has never been told.
In our admiration of visible objects we are liable to pass by and over
look the source or foundation whence cometh all wealth and upon
which every successful enterprise is established, viz., the rich, productive
soil that needs no irrigation.
Around Clear Lake there are thousands of acres of land fully equal and
much of it superior to the lands in other parts of the State now being Util
ized for the production of sugar beets.
The powers of production in these lands have been tested only to a limited
extent, but where preparation and proper culture have been applied the re
sults have greatly exceeded all reasonable anticipation.
All the cereals, vegetables of all kinds and alfalfa are grown to wonder
ful perfection, and yet not a tenth of the capacity of the soil is used, be
cause no market is obtainable except a local one and that exceedingly lim
ited.
Lake County has no system of irrigation: does not need any; never has
a failure of crops. This year, while many southern counties failed to raise
anything. Lake County harvested an abundant crop. In many of the val
leys artesian water is found in ample supply at depths of from eighty to
100 feet.
The fruit product even now amounts to hundreds of tons, many orchards
just beginning and others soon to come into bearing will increase the vol
ume many fold. Only those who are able to haul their products in wagons
to a market obtain anything for their surplus, ofttimes the expense overbal
ancing the profits, even with those. The inquiry may be suggested as to
why those mineral springs, the waters of which possess such wonderful cur
ative properties, are not overcrowded with health-seekers; why the rich soil,
capable of yielding such lavish products, is not taxed to its utmost capaci
ty, and, above all, why the pure, refreshing, health-giving atmosphere of
Lake County is not sought by the thousands who live and languish upon
beds of sorrow, dying by inches in the foggy, malarial sections, while relicf â
immediate relicf â and perhaps permanent cures are to be found so near by.
We answer: There is no railroad into Lake County. If railroad connec
tion should be extended to Clear Lake the patronage of the entire county In
every department of business and productive enterprise is virtually assured.
An immense passenger traffic could be worked up by a convenient and rapid
means of reaching the lake, whence only a few miles will take the visitor
to Highland Springs, Bartlett Springs, Seigler Springs or any of the pleas
ure resorts desired, and those places would be largely patronized the whole
year through.
Upon the beautiful, placid waters of Clear Lake would appear a great
variety of sail and steam craft for the amusement and pleasure of the mul
titude who would resort thither for recreation from the large cities.
The inquiry is also suggested. Is the building of a railroad into Lake
County to Clear Lake practicable? We answer upon the authority of capa
ble engineers it is. The shortest, most direct, least expensive and most
feasible route is from Hopland Station nn the line of the San Francisco
and North Pacific Railroad, via Highland Springs to Lakeport on the lake.
From Hopland to the foot of the mountains is about five miles, com
paratively level, not difficult or expensive to build a roadbed.
Through the mountains to Highland Springs Is about twelve miles; no
serious barriers to encounter; some deep cutting and filling will be neces
sary, but railroads have been built in California through much more for
midable obstructions. The distance from Highland Springs trt Lakeport is
about eight miles, over a valley as easy for constructing a roadbed as the
same distance through Sacramento Valley.
It Avill b<- noted that the entire distance is estimated at twenty-five miles
for a railroad line, whereas the present traveled road direct from Hop
land to Lakeport is estimated at eighteen miles. A number of men of large
experience and business sagacity have expressed the opinion that this pro
ject is one ot t best openings to invest idle capital to be found anywhere;
that the building of the railroad would develop the latent resources of the
county, inspire the people with increased energy and multiply the enter
prises already established so that it would in a short time pay a fine divi
dend. WILLIAM J. BIGGERSTAFF.

CANCELS THE
CONTRACT FOR
CITY GARBAGE
Crematory Gompany
Withdraws.
SUPERVISORS IN MANY DEALS
FIRE DEPARTMENT DEMANDS
BETTER WATER SERVICE.
Shea & Shea Figure the Cost of Fur
nishing the New Hall
of Justice at Some
$80,000.
Three cleverly conceived but poorly exe
cuted jobs of ample proportions stuck
their heads up at the meeting of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday, and af
ter nodding pleasantly at Captain Delany
and one or two other acquaintances on
the board disappeared again beneath the
surface to appear probably at another
time.
The garbage contract, which provided
that the city should pay the running ex
penses and a reasonable profit to the
crematory company for Incinerating the
refuse gathered from private houses, was
first on parade, but it was called down
in its first blush by a vigorous letter
from the crematory company, which
said that owing to the unkind
criticism that the newspapers had
heaped upon the proposition and the
mistaken idea of the contract that seemed
to prevail among the citizens whom it was
designed to benefit, the company could
do nothing but withdraw and, for the
present, refuse to enter into any contract
whatsoever for burning the city's gar
,bage. ; â¢
"When the matter: evetually came
â¢up. for consideration Supervisor Lack
mann moved that the advertisement of
the contract be stopped and the instru
ment be returned to the crematory com
pany. His motion found a second in Britt,
and as Mayor Phelan put the motion, the
board voted to indefinitely postpone fur
ther action.
Another gilt-edged "graft" in the shaj>e
of a resolution. to pay $17,000 for the prop
erty through which it is proposed to open
L.yoh street to the water front was on
the flla.of new business when it was
brought into the chambers, but the dis
covery was made that there were not
enough votes to push it through, and it
was taken off the file before it had got
before the board.
The property on the Lyon street exten
sion was appraised at $3000 as its present
maximum valuation. The appraisers
were Thomas Magee, A. L. Baldwin and
G. H. Umbsen, three of the foremost real
estate operators in the city. Yesterday's
resolution provided that the sum of $17,
000 be paid for it, and F. T. Duhring was
named as the agent for the property
owners.
The furnishing of the new Hall of Jus
tice bids fair to be as prolific of profit
as anything that has engaged the atten
tion, of the board during the latter half
of its existence, particularly if the esti
mate of Shea & Shea, the architects,
which was submitted yesterday, shall be
reported favorably by the Committee on
Public Buildings. .
The Shea estimate aggregates $80,000,
the expenditure of which is divided as
follows:
Furniture, $40,000: combination gas and
electric fixtures, $18,000; Bertillon system
of identification photographic appliances,
$8000; telephone system and electric light
apparatus, marble switch-board, indica
tors, etc., connecting and furnishing the
electric light system in the building, $6500;
ventilating screens to , : all windows and
transoms, throughout, $3000; kitchen
ranges, $1000; metal ventilating hoods,
$1000; metal racks and shelves, $300; pris
on sinks, drains and trays, $150; ash boxes,
wood, coal, vegetable metal' boxes, $175;
ucaacer kitchen utensils, $500; vault doors
and metallic shelving. $1000: racks, water
filters for entire building, $3000.
There was no itemized list of the furni
ture that was bid for to the extent of
$40,000 nor of the photographic appliances
designed for the experimentation of Chief
Lees that is billed at $8000. These things
the board did not take time to discuss,
but referred the estimate to the commit
tee.
Two important communications from
the Fire Commissioners were read and
referred to the Fire Committee. The first
was inspired by the Baldwin fire and the
second was brought out by the same
catastrophe. Number 1 read as follows:
The Honorable Board of Supervis
ors: The Board of Fire Commission- i
ers respectfully desire to call your
attention to the fact that during the
progress of the fire at the Baldwin
Hotel on the morning of the 23d inst.
all that portion of the city which re
ceives its water supply from the Col
lege Hill reservoir was without wa
ter. Complaints have been made at
this office from citizens in the neigh
borhood of Ellis and Hyde streets,
McAllister and Webster, Fifteenth j
and Noe and Chinatown south of
Jackson street.
These facts disclose a most serious
state of affairs that imperatively de
mands immediate attention, and
some proper remedy should be applied
without delay. Respectfully,
The Board of Fire Commissioners.
The second stated that on rainy or foggy
nights it is almost impossible for the de
partment to get its apparatus over the
slippery pavement to the scene of
any fire that may be on. and requested the
board to consider a plan to lay in the cen
ter of all streets of an 8 per cent gTade or
over a fourteen-foot strip of basalt blocks
and on streets of less than S per cent
grade a strip of bitumen. Such an im
provement, the letter stated, would pre
vent the feet of the fire horses slipping on
the wet bitumen and would greatly facili
tate the work of the department.
By a vote of seven to two the Natural
Ice Company was granted permission to
erect poles and maintain wires for an
electric system along Ninth street to Di
vision street and along that street to the
block bounded by Division, Rhode Island,
Alameda and Kansas streets.
Captain Delany"s gambling ordinance
came up again in somewhat changed at
tire. It no longer discriminated against
freeze out in favor of the slot machines,
but stopped gambling for gain altogether
It was referred to the Judiciary Commit
tee, but Chairman Smith would not stand
for it, and demanded that it be given into
the hands of the Police Committee. Mavur
Phelan finally settled the matter by stav
ing with hia original decision and the or
dinance will have to rind death at the
hands of the judiciary.

She was off the heads last Friday, but the
wind fell light and no progress could be
CZARINA AS SHE WILL APPEAR.
The work of repairing and transforming the big steam collier is rapidly progressing, and in a few
weeks the Czarina will be back in the San Francisco-Seattle trade. The hole in her port bow made by the
river steamer J. D. Peters has been nearly covered with new plates and the well deck has been built up to a
level with the bulwarks. The alteration has added greatly to the appearance of the Czarina, and she will be

made. Sunday she was sighted by the
lookout at Point Lobos, but Captain
Christiansen thought he could sail in, and
refused ft tow. The breeze died away and
the vessel and passengers remained out
side all night: Yesterday morning the
tun Reliance took her in tow and brought
her in.
The passengers by the Spreckels were
Mrs. R. Zeigler, Dr. and Mrs. J. S. Tracy
and M. fiesselberger. When the brig left
Honolulu Mrs. ZHgler was accompanied
by her husband, but when the vessel was
five days out he died. Mr. Zeigler had
been for twenty years bookkeeper of the
Pahala plantation. Some time ago his phy
sician told him he was suffering 1 from tu
berculosis of the kidneys, and advised him
to make a trip to San Francisco for his
health. Upon reaching- Honolulu he was
taken suddenly worse and Dr. Tracy told
him that the chances were against him
ever reaching the Golden Gate. â¢ He per
sisted, however, and died at sea.
When it came to a disposition of the re
friends of the happy younff couple will

There was no embalming fluid on the
brig, and Captain Christiansen was in a
quandary. Finally he decided to use same
of the sugar which made up the vessel's
cargo. All the interior organs of the body
were removed, and after the cavity had
been cleansed it w.is packed full of sugar.
The hole was then sewed up and the re
mains placed in 'a cofiln made by the
yhip'.s carpenter. The passengers and the
remains of Mr. Zeigler were landed at Pn
cifie street wharf. Later the body was re
moved to the undertaker's. The funeral
will take place from there.
The schooner Defender arrived at Port
Townsend yesterday :ifter a very fine pas
sage of fourteen fays from Kahului. This
is by far and away the best run of the
year from Hawaii to Puget Sound.
Julius Tillman and William Weiss had
a narrow escape from drowning yester
day morning. They borrowed a Whitehall
from Ju''k Morgan to visit one of the i
ships in the stream, but when off Lorn j
hard street wharf the boat capsized. They |
got on the bottom of the Whitehall and for I
an hour yelled and waved their shirts
trying to" attract the attention of the
passi ngers and crews on the Sausalito
and Tiburon ferry boats. Just when they
were about dropping off the bottom of th<>
boat from cold and exhaustion an Italian
fisherman named Gazella came along in
his boat and rescued them.
Jim Fotheringham. a lad about 14 years
old. met with a severe accident on the
ship Falls of Clyde yesterday. He stum
bled and fell down the after hatch, |
striking on his head. He was badly cut

SCOTT'S SECOND CONTEST.
Again Contends His Wife Was of Un
sound Mind.
The litigation over the estate of Anpre
lia R. Scott did not end when E. W.
Scott, husband of the deceased, met de
feat in his first contest. Mr. Scott filed
a second contest yesterday, of which the
principal characteristic is brevity.
He etates that he is the surviving hus
band of the deceased, Is of the age of Cl
man. After a bridal tour In Southern
California Mr. Postly and his bride
will sail for the Orient, where several
months are to be spent.
The bride-to-be is one of the most
popular buds of the younger set. She
is remarkably handsome, inheriting her
exquisite coloring, patrician features
and distlng-ue bearing from her noble
Greek ancestors on her mother's side.
Miss Cook was educated in this city
and after her graduation went to Eu
rope to be "finished off." While at
Geneva she met Mr. Postly and that
was the beginning of the romance that
is to close so prettily and happily to
morrow.
Mr. Postly, the happy man, is the son
of Commodore Postly of the swell
Larchmont Yacht Club of New York.
Commodore and Mrs. Postly arrived
from the Empire City Sunday evening
to be present at the wedding of their
son and the California belle.
Miss Cook has received many very
elegant bridal presents already. They
comprise all manner of costly and ele
gant articles of virtu, exquisite jewels
and rare laces. Among the many highly
prized gifts is a historic fan that once
was the property of the famous wit
and noted court beauty, Mrs. Le Vert.
The fan was presented to Mrs. Le Vert
by Henry Clay, who in turn gave it as
a charming memento of her charming
self to Mrs. Henry E. Highton, aunt
of the bride. Mrs. Highton has given
the highly prized fan to her niece.
years, and as such surviving husband is
the heir at law of said deceased.
Continuing, he states: "This contestant
denies each and all of the allegations of
the petition filed on November 14, 1593. by
Wealthy Warmell praying for the pro
bate of said alleged will, excepting the
allegations of the death, age and resi
dence of said deceased. This contestant
alleges that at the time of the alleged
signing and execution of the pretended
last will and for a long time prior there
to and up to- the date of her death the
said deceased was not of sound and dis
posing mind.
On these allegations the contestant
prays that the will be refused admittance
to probate. Judge Coffey sustained the
â contentions of the proponents in the first
contest interposed by Scott, and although
he found that Mrs. Scott was exceedingly
eccentric failed to lind that she was of
unsound mind. Scott, it seems, Is still
of opinion that the small bequest to him
in his wife's will was due to a disordered
mind, and on that ground will continue
his battle for a larger portion of her es
tate.
A jury will listen to the evidence dur
ing the trial of the second contest and for
that reason Scott expects to turn the tide
of liigaion in his favor.
THE BONBON GIRLS.
A Novel Entertainment to Be Given

The entertainment to be given to-night
In Native Sons' Hall by eighteen young
ladles of Burna Vista Parlor of the Na

the benefit of the fund of the parlor used

The entertainment, which is an extrava

titled "The. Influential Order of Choco-

a full dress rehearsal, a most amusing:
and entertaining performance. Aftor the

into the mysteriesi there will be. under
the head of "good of the order," a choice
programme of songs, instrumental music,

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Nov. 2S.â An animated buying
movement broke out in the last half hour of
to-day's stock market, which carried prices
throughout the list buoyantly above the pre
vious high level and made the closing very
strong. The demand was broad and better dis
tributed than at any other time during the
day. and the market looked healthier and
freer from manipulation and less congested in
a tew prominent stocks than at any time dur-
ing the current upward movement. Just what
the motive- was for the renewal of the buying
was not very obvious. Perhaps the sullen ob

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 28.â Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says:
All the stock markets here were cheerful to
day with rising prices, the cheapness of money
being the principal factor. Americans show no
signs of falling off, and there appears to be
a little increase In the speculative account.
Contangoes on Americans at the settlement to
day averaged about 5 per cent, but St. Paul
was carried over at 1 per cent. ''i'.Zlr'-L;'
The ' gold market was active to-day. $4a0,000
having been bought up outside for export to
Germany and the demand being yet unsatis
fied. Inquiries were received from New York
as to the price of the metal, but as it was 77s

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 2<!.â The early tendency of
! wheat was toward higher prices. Holders of
! December and May wheat who were disposed
| to continue the liquidation that made such a
weak market Saturday were deterred from sell
! ing at first by the firmness shown by Liverpool,
I where an opening %@%d decline was more than
j recovered hy the time trading commenced here.
i After a short period of steadiness, during
! which time the smaller shorts covered mod
i erately. the market weakened, and for over
! an hour the tendency was distinctly down
; ward and developing the most weakness.
I About 11:30 the market began to Improve. The
! world's shipments figures again showed a big
falling off from Russian ports. Out of a total
of 7,761.000 bushels shipped from all points
j Russia contributed but 992,000 bushels, while
( Canada and the United States sent 6,525.000
bushel 3. It was figured that Russia had not
raised so large .a crop as claimed or has re
solved to hold it for higher prices. Either ex
planation was bullish and had considerable in
fluence on the market. Liquidation gradually
ceased and the demand from shorts grew heav
ier. The market during the last hour's trading
was decidedly strong, prices advancing stead
ily under an increasing general demand, and
highest prices were reached Bhortlv before the
close. May closed at 66Â».Â«'566%c and December
] 66%<Â§66%e.
Corn developed a good deal of strength, holding
â¢ firm, even when wheat was in the dumps. Local
\ bulls Increased their lines and shorts covered
actively. The prospect of softer weather was a
bull influence. May closed %@%c higher.
Oats were strong. Quite a large business
was done. The strength was mostly In sym
pathy with wheat and corn. May closed %c
higher.
In spite that hog receipts were with one ex
ception the heaviest on record, provisions were
fairly steady. Some weakness was shown at
first and prices ultimately recovered, the mar
ket being firm at the close. January pork and
ribs are 2%c lower and lard unchanged from
Saturday.

Rather more inquiry for Prunes Is reported.
The New York Commercial says of the Prune
I market under date of November 23: : "Prunes
are moving freely. The principal feature of the
market "is the continued demand for Oregon
and Washington Italians, which hitherto have
sought almost in vain for entrance to this mar
ket. The only large Prunes procurable are
from the North-west, and the situation is so
strong that available supplies are being rapid
ly exhausted. It happens that consumers are
using Prunes as they formerly did cluster
raisins at table, which creates a strong de
mand for large sizes In certain localities, and
buyers- are taking everything they can find In
the shape of a Prune to satisfy this new re
quirement. It also happens that this demand
includes the very small sizes, 130-150" and
those are wanted. Altogether sales have been
larger the past week than any single week dur
ing the season. One large handler said fully
15,000 boxes had changed hands since last
Wednesday, and that negotiations were in
progress for sales which would aggregate as
many more. No particulars were obtainable
regarding either transaction; but it was inti
mated that about full prices were obtained.
The activity was about as great yesterday as
the day before, but it was paid ' that it was
principally deliveries on previously placed or
ders and comprised .comparatively little of the
present sales."

office, where complete sets of charts and sail-
Ing directions of the world are kept on haJW
for comparison and reference, and the latest
information cftn always be obtained regarding
lights, dangers to navigation and all matters
of interest to ocean commerce.
The time ball on the tower of the new Ferry
building, at the foot of Market street. Is hoisted

noon. 120 th meridian, by telegraphic signal re
ceived each day from the United States Signal

Lieutenant, U. S. N., in charge
NOTICE TO MARINERS.
Branch Hydrographic Office, U. S. N.. Mci
chants" Exchange, San Francisco.' Cal
Nov. 28, 1898.
The- following information of Interest to
shipmasters has just been received at this of
fice from the Hydrographic Office, Washington
D. C. : Fishing banks of the North Pacificâ
The fishing banks, which are shown In green
on the present Issue of the North Pacific Pilot
Chart, were complied from the reports of the
United States Fish Commission steamer Al
batross and from other sources, and were tabu
lated and described in several previous issues
of the Pilot Chart.
It is hoped that masters of all fishing vessels
will provide themselves with the Hydrographic
Office blanks for recording weather reports
and make the single daily observation. These
blanks may be obtained from the Branch
Hydrographic Office at Ban Francisco, Portland
or Port Townsend, and can bo forwarded free
at any port in the United States or Canada, or
through any United States Consul. Vessels
unprovided with barometers can at least record
the direction and force of the wind, which will
be of use to the Hydrographic Office.
Forecast of wind and weather In the North
Pacific Ocean for December, 180Â§-!-Tsje trade
wind limits may be exited to be found a.
little farther to the south than la?t month
During this month the northern j.art of thÂ»
North Pacific Ocean wili be subject to nercÂ°
gales. These will probably be found dv.> nrlnoi
pally to either of two classes- of â¢ barometric
I depressions, one class .originating in the west
| moving to the eastward' over the Japan Scsi
land across the Island of Hokoshu. ai
[other class forming to the south of the thirtieth
parallel and moving northward, and teruiirV la
approach the average storm track tor Â£>Â.
I cember shown upon the Pilot Chart. ThÂ» r-"^
glon of greatest frequency and Intend â ,- , â¦
these gales will probably lie north of theÂ»
ihirty-flfth parallel and reach across the en
tire ocean, but between Japan an<l longitude
160 deg. east it will extend as far south as
latitude 30 deg. north. In the vicinity of the
Philippine and Hawaiian islands frequent
squalls may be expected.
Occasional highs and lows will be found
moving In a general easterly direction
the ocean. Generally, in fr^nt of the .â¢.
area, or low, the weather is damp, with
thermometer rising and barometer falling,
while in front of the anticyclonic circulation,
or high, it is dry. cooler and the barometer
rises. Typhoons are usually Infrequent this
After crossing the line coming north, vessels
bound fnr the west coast of America may ex
pect heavy rain and wind squalls in paesi:, B
through the doldrums.
Occasional fog and heavy mist may he ex-
Dected along the American coast during this
month, though not sufficient to warrant its
being shown on the chart.

Policemen Goleman and Clarke report
ed to Chief Lees yesterday that twenty
eight out of the 29 arrests had been made
by them Saturday night before Sec
retary Kane sent for Judge Conlan. There
was, therefore, no necessity for sending
for the Judge. When the Judge was noti

that he had been imposed upon by Kane,

WORK OF CLEARING AWAY THE RUINS LAGS.
FKTENDS of Mrs. A. Gardner are fearful that beneath the blackened ruins of the Baldwin Hotel the crisped
remains of the unfortunate woman are burled. Mrs Gardner formerly lived In Oakland, where her husband
was killed two years ago by the Seventh-street local. She arrived from Panama some days ago on the City of
Sydney and last Tuesday Informed some of her a< rjuaintanees that she Intended to remain at the Baldwin
that "night. Her friends have seen nothing of her since that time and are of the opinion that she perished In the
lire
"' The work of v aring down the threatening walls Is not likely to begin In earnest for two or three days yet.
F J Baldwin scf-mw determined to delay the demolition as long as there Is a possibility of his being able to Bave
i anything from' the wreck, no matter at what risk there may be to life and limb.
i All day long a score or more of workmen delved among the debris that fills the basement or clambered
i among the rooms fronting on Powell and Ellis streets, lowering half burned and water soaked mattresses, two and
i thren legged chairs and other remnants of the furnishings of the apartments. A few men were employed by the
i merchants occupying stores on the Market-street side, in searching for their safes and wares. All these were In
Imminent danger and half a dozen times during the day they rushed wildly Into the street when portions of the
overhanging walla gaire way and fell with a crash.
new bitumen pavement on Market street seems destined to be as badly wrecked as the building itself. In
tfce removal <â <: safes and the rigging of tackle to pull down the walls large iron pegs are driven through the
bitumen and to wHch are attached the ropes and blocks. When they are withdrawn, beyond kicking a
littj.- I'-..-., dirt into them, po attempt is made to fill up the holes. Four or live of these holes were made In re
moving one .small safe yesterday.
A sign was posted on the windows of the pharmacy, yesterday, announcing that Madison & Burke, Baldwin's
agents would receive bids for tearing down the walls and removing the debris. Inquiry at the agents' office
elicited the information that bids would be opened to-day at noon, and the contract let probably to-morrow.
As it will take at (east a day or two more for the successful contractor to make his preparations for undertak
ing the work, it seems certain that the swaying walls and tottering chimneys will continue to menace life until Thurs
day or longer. The agent also said it was expected it would take sixty days at least to clear away the last of the
wreckage. ,
This is. a dreary- prospect for the friends of missing persons whose remains are believed to be somewhere In
the mass of wood, brick and iron, and the 1 odors already arising from the place, as well as the constant danger
from the walls, demands that the health authorities interfere in the matter at once. The health officer has already
notified Baldwin once to clear away the wreck without delay, but it seems to have had no effect upon that individ
ual, who. apparently, thinks more of saving a few yards of scorched carpet than he does of protecting the health
and lives of people in that vicinity.

ADMIRAL DEWEY COMMENDS
THE COMING CHARITY BAZAAR
THE above letter, received by the management of the Charity Bazaar and California Musical Contest, from Ad
miral Dewey, commending the noble and philanthropic project of holding a benefit during the month of Decem
ber for the purpose of raising sufficient money to Insure a "Merry Christmas" to the city's poor, is one of the
few that have been published since the name of Dewey became a household word. The people of San Francisco
can look with pride upon the unusual mark of recognition that the great warrior has bestowed upon them in giv
ing his signature as an indorsement of their effort.
At the request of Captain de St. Hubert; manager of the Charity Bazaar, the admiral has accepted the responsi
bility of becoming the patron of the public charity which will be fully tested at the Mechanics' Pavilion during the
month of December. Those who attend the coming benefit will have the assurance as a guarantee of Its honesty
of purpose of the sanction of one of the foremost men of the present century.
The above letter, with those already received from Commodore Schley, Admiral Sampson and other heroes of
the recent war, will be framed and placed on exhibition at the Pavilion during the progress of the bazaar.
The formal opening will be held next Thursday evening, and will continue during the entire month of December.
Preparations' for the opening night are now almost complete. Everything has been done to make the undertaking a
perfect success. If failure comes it will be through the Indifference of the public to the wants and necessities of the
poor and needy, and not the lack of effort on the part of the management.
The first night of the bazaar will be devoted to a separate benefit to the firemen of the city for their heroic work
In controlling the Baldwin fire. The musical programme for the occasion is as follows:
March, "Honor to the Brave (Riviere); overture, â¢'Festival" (Leutner): vocal solo. "Romeo and Juliet." waltz song (Gou
nod). Miss Carolyn Roper; selection, "Faust," arranged by Riviere (Gounod): vocal solo, "Oh, Hall of Song," from "Tann
hauser" IWagner), Miss Maud Fay; the Yon Meyerinck Choir, "By Babylon's Wave" (Gounod), under direction of Madame Anna
yon Meyerinck; grand patriotic march, "Greater America," composed and conducted by Miss Nina Ch. de St. Hubert; vocal
duet. â¢'Hungarian Dances" (Brahms), Miss Carolyn Roper and Miss Maud Fay; selection, "Tannhauser" (Wagner); waltz,
"Wiener Mad 'In" iZienhrer); cornet solo, "The Lost Chord" (Sullivan); galop, "Turquois" (Xuah Brandt).
the officers to serve them upon the
women, but this was refused, as all the
women on the street had already been
sted on that batch of warrants and
i some twice. The otncers were, however,
; instructed to serve the warrants upon any
! woman that had not been arrested Satur
' day night, if new warrants were ob
1 tamed by Kane they could make service
! upon the women and the court could de
j cide upon the legality of the proceeding:.
Chief I-ets denounced Kane yesterday
for making- a false charge against the
i police to Judge Conlan Saturday night,
I and said he had no confidence in Kane.
When Kane first made a proposition lo
! him about the closing- of Bacon place he
said the object was to effect a reduction
! in the value of the adjoining- property in
: view of the proposal to purchase it for
park purposes. The Chief was indignant
( at the sup.ET f 'stion. which, he said, savored
| of blackmail, and he refused to discuss
I the matter with Kane and asked him to
i send his principals to him. Mr. Chad
Many Lives Jeopardized in Order That a Few Worthless Arti
cles of Furniture May Be Saved From the Burned
Hotel.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1898.
bourne, one of the principals, came to him
and said that Kane had reported that he
declined to interfere, which was false.
Yesterday afternoon Kane swore to
eleven complaints before Judge Conlan
charging eleven women, whose names
were given, with keeping a house of ill
repute. This docs away with the illegality
of rearresting them so soon for vagrancy.
Last night new moves were made by
both the defense and the prosecution.
tary Kane changed the charge of
vagrancy which he has formerly placed
against the women to that of keeping a
disreputable house, and the attorneys for
the property owners won what they pro
nounce a victory in habeas corpus pro
ceedings brought in the case of one of the
women under arrest.
At 7 o'clock last evening Attorneys Ach
and Rothschild appeared before Judge
Cook and presented a petition of babe? 8
corpus in the case of Lude I'.runet. This
woman was arrested four times on the
charge of vagrancy and was released on
$1000 bonds for each count. The attorneys
surrendered her to the court on the last
three warrants issued and then petitioned
the Judge for her release claiming that
the bail was excessive. Without argu
ment Judge Cook decided that the $1000
bond put up when she was hrst arrested
was BUfnctent, and ordered her release
on the last three warrants, which had been
served within ten days of each other.
Mr. Ach made no issue, in the habeas
corpus proceedings of last night, of the
fact that $Hhx> was excessive bail on a
single count of vagrancy, but it is under
stood that he will probably bring this up
when the case comes to trial.
Secretary Kane had eleven warrants in
his possession last night, ten of them giv
ing the names of the women wanted an 3
one being a "Jane Doe" warrant. Five
of these were aerved, one of the women
arrested being Lucie Brunet. The other
women could nor. be found. The Inmates
of the houses hac 1 changed rooms and the
trouble Kane had In locating the parties
he wanted was. a source of great amuse
ment for those interested in the defense.
Robert C. Clapp and Joseph Michel were
also again arrested for letting tenement
houses for Immoral purposes.
DOCKERY EXONERATED.
Leipsic Withdraws Charges and the
Board Dismisses the Case.
Isaac Leipsic has thought better of it,
and has decided to .withdraw the charges
of drunkenness he made recently before
the Board of Health against Inspector
Dockery.
The board met In special session last
evening to consider the alleged transgres
sions of Dockery, and the accused in
spector was on hanu with his witnesses,
prepared to prove that Ceipsic's charges
had DO foundation other than spite.
He was not called upon to do so, how
ever, for no sooner had the special order
been announced than Attorney J. N. K.
Wilson, representing the complainant,
opened up with a volley of profuse apol
ogies for the trouble his client had caused
the board, and asked that the charges be
withdrawn. "My client," said Mr. Wilson,
"lias found a good deal of trouble in Und
ine witnesses that would come here and
testify for him. There is no legal process
by which he can command them to ap
pear, and they will not come voluntarily.
Mr. LelpÃic thinks, anyway, that he had
rather have nothing more to do with it,
and I have advised him to make the with
drawal." Dockery smiled and agreed, and
it was so ordered.
â¢A letter from Reuben H. Lloyd was
read, in which he complained that the
noxious fumes and ashes from the garb
;iK'- crematory wore making life in the
Mission unbearable, and he asked that
the board take some action looking to the
abatement of the nuisance.- The Mayor
referred the matter to a committee com
posed of Drs. Fitzgibbon, Baum and Wil
liamson.
Dr. Gallwey reported that the sanitary
inspection of Chinatown was progressing:
successfully. Instructions have been is
sued to inspectors to clean out and wtnte
wash all places found in an unsanitary
condition and to report to the board all
cases where disinfection is needed. The
Chinese fish and vegetable stalls have all
been under inspection in the last two
weeks, nnd most of them have been thor
oughly cleaned.
The board adjourned to meet again on
Thursday evening at 8:30 o'clock.
TWO HABD FIGHTS BOOKED.
Jeffries and Kennedy and Maxwell
and Denny Will Do Battle
Next Month.
The Western Athletic Club, at a meet
ing of last evening, signed Jim Jeffries
of Los Angeles to fight Joe Kennedy of
the Excelsior Athletic Club a twenty
round contest at Woodward's Pavilion on
tho evening of December 30.
Billy Delaney, who is the manager of
Jeffries, signed for the champion of the
orange groves, and "Young" Mitchell,
who is looking out for the Interests of
Kennedy, also placed his signature to the
document. The agreement states that the
men will battle for 75 and 25 per cent of
the gate receipts, and that if they cannot
agree upon a referee three days before the
mill the club will select a man from
among the available local material. It
is, however, stated that the managers
of both men have decided upon Jim Mc-
Donald, the popular umpire of the base
ball league, to act as referee.
The Excelsior Club has also matched
Sammy Maxwell and Martin Denny, lato
of Australia, to fight twenty rounds under
its auspices on the evening of December
21. It Is to be hoped the contestants will
allow for the feelings of an indulgent pub
lic and fight on the "square."
Will Punish Haywards.
TV. B. Haywards, the father of the
babe that was sent to the crematory in
a scavenger's cart, was arrested yester
day morning by Detective Dillon and
booked on a charge of violating section
297 of the Penal Code by Attempting to
bury a body outside of the regular places
of interment. When the police read in
The Call that the mother of the child
was not Mrs. Haywards. as he alleged,
they lost all sympathy for him and de
termined to punish him. The case of the
two scavengers was called In Judge Mo
gan's court yesterday and continued till
Thursday.

P. J. SHIELDS FOR SECRETARY
ASPIRANTS FOR THE ADJUTANT
GENERAL'S OFFICE.
General A. W. Barrett Has Not Ap
plied â Vacancies on the State
Board of Agricul
ture.
The aspirants for the position of adju
tant general of California are vigorously
presenting their claims for recognition.
The report that Adjutant General Bar
rett has applied for reappointment has
no foundation in fact. General Barrett
states that he has not applied to Gov
ernor-elect Gage for the position and that
his friends have not made application in
his behalf. Furthermore, he does not ex
pect to be appointed or to petition for
the appointment. He recognizes that
the adjutant general in a sense is a
member of the Governor's cabinet and
should belong to the political party to
which the executive belongs.
There are now two vacancies on the
State Board of Agriculture, and it is
expected that Governor Budd will In a
few days fill the vacancies. The direc
tors whose terms have expired are Fred
Cox and J. E. Terry. The friends of
Senator Cox claim that he will be re
annointfed. Colonel Park Henshaw of
Chico is said to be an applicant for one
of the places.
It is understood that Peter J. Shields,
private secretary of Governor Budd, will
succeed Edwin F. Smith as secretary of
the State Board of Agriculture.
governor - elect Gage returned from
Sacramento last evening and will remain
in the city until to-morrow evening. He
went to the capital to engage a house
or suitable living accommodations for at
least one winter.
THE SCRUB PUNCHERS.
Contests That Were Not So Warm as
to Excite the Least Ad
miration.
The sports who witnessed the boxing
contests given under the auspices of the
Atlas Club last evening in Turn Vereln
Hall were disappointed, because the club
did not carry out its programme accord
ing to the announcement.
The opening entertainment was an eight
round bout between Charles Vickers and
"Kid" Johnson, with Joe Reay as referee.
It was a sprinter contest all through the
event, which was characterized by many
amusing tumbling features. Johnson
scored a strong lead in the early rounds,
but in the laat rounds Vickers ran ahead
of the game, so to speak, and the referee
pleased everybody by announcing a (haw.
The second event was to have been a
six-round "go" between Jack Sullivan and
Jockey Evans, but owing to the fact that
the house was small and that coin was
rather scarce, tiie contestants determined
not to tight more than four rounds. This
announcement displeased the manage
ment, and the "feathers" were ordered out
I of the ring.
The final event was to have been an
eight-round bout between Joe Butler (col
ored) of San Jose and Fred Craig (the
Bausalito Cooler). Butler had all the beat
of the first round, bringing a liberal now
of olaret from Craig's nose, but in the
second round Butler showed the white
feather when ha received a right smash
on the nock which sent him through the
ropes. He returned in a dazed state and
the referee, rather than see "a good man
put to sleep," stopped the contest and
awarded "the heavy-weight champion
ship" to Mr. Craig.
St. Andrew's Society Banquet.
The St. Andrew's Society, one of the
oldest benevolent organizations on the
coast, will celebrate its thirtieth anniver
sary by a banquet at the Palace Hotel to
morrow evening. Toasts will be respond
ed to by J. U. Keinstoin, Robert MacKin
zie. Franklin K. Lane, John McNab and
Mayor Phclan.

son, rector of St. Peter's. San Francisco.
The annual sermon was delivered by
Bishop F. R.. -Graves of Shanghai, wh
dealt with the. subject of the Episcopal
church in relation to foreign missions. .In
his address he- explained why missionary
â work in a foreign tield Is so slow and why
results are so lons in materializing. He
referred to the very low sense of moralit
and the entire absence of higher feelin
among the heathen races; anil these dirti
culties render the work of Christianizing
very laborious and slow. .lie. has. see
much in his experience to encourage him
and he strove to. impress upon the dele
gates present .the necessity for prosecut
ing the work â  with greater vigor and o
never being discouraged. 'â  "â¢

complimented the Daughters of the King
for their active work. Rev. D. O. Kelley
missionary- of . San Francisco, referred
briefly to the work at the Presidio. He
said that the hospital received special
attention, ;.; but. that when it was full
there was ho provision made for religious
services, and the- restrictions were so
strict and unreasonable that it: was diffi
cult for a clergyman to do anything. He
recommended' that a regular "clergyman

Rev. G. Howitt of Mill Valley said that

ficult, as the pe.c>p|e of Larkspur and Mill

a broad line :. of. demarcation between
those two places. Rev. Hamilton Lee
of Martinez reported that Episcopal
â work in Contra Costa is nourishing, al
though light crops caused light collec
tions; Contra Costa '; has good Sunday
schools and rested choirs, and very ac
tive ladies* societies; Rt_-v. T. L. Ran
dolph of Lorin said that an earnest zeal
is being shown at his mission, which is
the only Episcopalian place of worship
between Berkeley and Oakland. Rev.
Mr. Radeliffe of. West. Berkeley present
ed a report somewhat discouraging. His
parish has. made some progress during

down. Ills ohqlr is jargely composed of

course, said that the. civilization of a
country could â¢ be pretty well estimated
by the conditions of : its women. Their

VI I
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 28.
Etta Brandes and her husband, William
A. Brandes, had their first experience
with the court this afternoon. They were
taken separately before Judge Cllft and
arraigned on charges of murder.
hi response to the court's inquiry
Brandes named F. W. Sawyer and John
K. Bennett as his counsel. District Attor
ney-elect John J. Allen appeared for the
people.
Brandes was the first to appear. He
maintained control of himself until Judge
; Clift reached the ominous words in the
: complaint, "to wit, murdering one Lillian
j Brandes, aged 13." Then Brandes cried.
; Tears poured freely down his cheeks, and
â , -while speaking to the court his sobs were
! audible throughout the court room. Al
1 though Brandes has been visited by At
i torney Deuprey and has said that he
| riiight engage him, no mention was made
lof that attorney to-day. Judge Clift
â  named Thursday morning, December 1,
| as the time to commence the preliminary
hearing of the alleged murderer.
As soon as Brandes was taken back to
the County Jail, his wife was taken into
court. She presented a strong contrast
to her husband in that she showed little
or no emotion, and the warrant charging
I her with murdering her stepdaughter did
not cause her to shed a tear. She was
heavily veiled, but answered the court's
questions in a. steady voice, as though
they were very ordinary queries. Her
' examination will commence on the morn
, ing of Friday, December 8. Since their
: arrest the husband and wife have not
been allowed to converse with each other.
They have told the officials different
i stories, and the District Attorney consid
ers it advisable not to permit them to
| discuss the matter until after the pre
. liminary examination.
POUNDMAN CONVICTED.
Peter Farrell Struck Down a Small
Boy to Take His Dog Away
From Him.
OAKLAND, Nov. 28.â Deputy Pound
master Pete Farrell was convicted in the
Police Court to-day on a charge of bat
tering little Charles Demousset some days
ago.
There were a number of witnesses, wtio
testified that the prisoner struck the lad,
knocking him down and taking a dog from
his possession. These facts were stoutly
denied by the dogcatcher.
When asked by District Attorney Mel
vin as to how the boy's eye was black
Â«-ned, Parrel] even denied that the lad
sustained a black eye at the time. The
dQjrcatchei" will be sentenced to-morrow.
Police- Judge Moore, in reply to the
boy's question as to how he could regain
-sioii of his canine, said: "It is
either robbery or petty larceny for a
poundman to take a dog away from its
owner when the latter has the animal in
his custody." Young Demousset, however,
will try to get an order from Mayor
Thomas restoring him his pet.
I It 1s not at all unlikely that Judge
I Moore will make an example of Farrell.

VICTIM TO
AMBITION
- J. J. Hooson, a Promising
Graduate of St. Mary's,
Dies at His Hay
wards Home.
JOSEPH J. HOOSON, who grad
uated from St. Mary's College
with honors less than a year
sgo, died yesterday a victim of
â ambition. At St. Mary's young
Hooaon was one of the most active
members of the athletic association
and also occupied a high place in the
various classes he attended. At the
graduating exercises in December
â  of last year Hooson's essay on
America and her foreign relations
was considered a most meritorious
piece of work for a youth not then
â  20 years old. After leaving St.
Mary's Joseph Hooson went to the
Hustings Law College and attempt
ed to so undertake the three years'

ORDERS FROM WASHINGTON
HAYNE TO MAKE OFFICIAL IN
VESTIGATION.
A Lieutenant From the State Uni
versity Ordered to Report Upon
the Agricultural Resources
Around Manila.
BERKELEY. Nov. 28.â Lieutenant A. P.
Hayne, an instructor in the agricultural
department of the University of Califor
nia, now stationed with one of the Cali
fornia regiments at Manila, has been de
tailed to conduct an official investigation
into the agricultural resources of the
Philippines and to make a report of the
results to Washington.
The news of Lieutenant Hayne's ap
pointment was received at the University
of California to-day from Manila. The
professors in the agricultural depart
ment look upon it as a signal honor con
ferred upon their recent associate. Lieu
tenant Hayne is an old pupil of Professor
E. W. Hilgard. He graduated some years
ago from Berkeley in the College of Nat
ural Sciences, taking special work In
agriculture. Subsequently he accepted an
instructorship in the same subject, and
later became assistant professor of viti
culture and oliveculture. At the outbreak
of the war he enlisted as a commissioned
officer, with the rank of second lieuten
ant, and went to Manila with the Philip
pines expedition.
The appointment to this new work was
made after communications between Sec- I
retary of Agriculture Wilson and General !
Merrltt. The Department of Agriculture !
requested detaileu information respecting
the resources of the islands, their cli
matic conditions, the productiveness of i
the soil, mineral wealth and agricultural j
features. General Merritt's selection fell i
at once upon Lieutenant Hayne, and the !
Berkeley instructor was asked to carry |
out the orders from Washington.
As to the plans to be pursued in execu- !
tion of the orders, no specific information
has yet been received. But it is under- i
stood that an exploration party will be
formed immediately for the purpose of
making extended excursions through tne
islands. These expeditions will be .or the
purpose of investigating the entire vege- |
table product of the country. Careful at- !
tention will be paid to collecting and pre
â erring specimens and obtaining accurate ;
decrlptions and reports. When fully com
pleted, the whole will be embodied in a
book to be issued by the Agricultural
Bureau, although partial reports may ue
put in pamphlet form and published from
time to time.
In addition to the work of exploration.
Secretary Wilson's order calls for tne
establishment of a United States agricul
tural experiment station. The selection
and procuring of a site for this work is
to be done later, after some of the more ,
general instructions have been carried j
out. The station itself will extend over i
sixty acres of land. On this a station- I
house is to be erected, which will form a
base for all experimenting, and where the i
collections of specimens will be stored.
In assuming charge of this important
undertaking. Lieutenant Hayne was
given full permission to choose the asso
ciates he wished. He writes that he has ;
made his selection almost entirely from i
the University of California boys now at |
Manila. Some of them are graduates ana :
others have finished their second or third
year In the scientific colleges, so their as- â¢
sistance is expected to be invaluable.
HAD AGREED TO
EXCHANGE SERVICES
DENTAL-MEDICO CASE FINALLY
ADJUDICATED.
Dr. McCarrjar Won in Justice's Court,
but Dr. Webster Wins on
Appeal.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 28.
The Interesting: trial of Dr. P. McCargar
against Dr. L. R. Webster, for the recov
ery of $36 60 for dental work was conclud
ed before Superior Judge Ogden this af
ternoon.
This is the case wherein Dentist Mc-
Cargar and Dr. Webster had verbally
agreed four years ago to exchange ser
vices in theii' respective professions. Dr.
McCargar agreeing to attend to the mo
lars of the Webster family, and Dr. Web
ster agreeing to sooth all fevers and ail
ments of the McCargars. There had been
plenty of dental work but no fevers. The
dentist had sued Dr. Webster in Justice
Cliffs court arid obtained a Judgment
for $36 50 and costs, but Dr. Webster ap
pealed.
Judge Ogden after hearing the testimony
held that the verbal contract was legal,
and that when Dr. McCargar on one oc
casion handed Dr. Webster s son a bill for
work performed on the son, saying' that
the contract had terminatetd, he thereby
admitted the existence of the contract.
Judgment was given in favor of defend
ant for costs.

The City Council.
OAKLAND, Nov. 28.â At the regular
meeting of the City Council to-night Cap
tain Goodall, president of the Lake Mer
ritt Sanitary Improvement Club, present
ed President Heitmann with a gavel
heavily mounted In silver. The inscrip^
tion on the gavel states that it is a
mark of the appreciation of the club for
the action of the Council in making the
necessary appropriation for the dredirin*
of Lake Merritt. *
A resolution was introduced stating that
Edson and John Adams were encroaching
upon the property of the city in the
upon the property of the city In the
structlng the City Attorney to take steps
to prevent the land being taken from the
city. After a little discussion the City
Attorney was authorized to procure an
abstract of the title before taking any
further steps. The City Clerk will notify
the water companies to prepare their an
nual statements for the year 1808, so that
rates can be fixed next February. As
this Council goes out of office in March,

teresting incident.
FRUIT TREES DYING.
Commissioner Barry Reports on Con
ditions of Orchards.
OAKLAND, Nov. 28.â Horticultural
Commissioner William Barry presented a
report to the Supervisors this morning
which shows that rain is badly needed in
this county. Unless enough moisture shall
fall within the next couple of weeks seri
ous loss will be inevitable. Mr. Barry
says in part:
The effect of the lack of rain the past season
is very noticeable In many orchards, among the
cherry trees especially, many of these having
died, but the effect on other fruit trees will
not be fully ascertained until the coming
spring. If the predictions of our weather ex
ports that this season will also be dry prove
true the losses of trees and shortage of fruit
will be seriously felt In this county and
throughout the State.
Reports from many of the routhern counties
of the loss of trees have proved a serious mat
ter to many orchardlsts, while from Castroville
down the whole length of Salinas Valley to
San I.uts Obispo. a distance of 150 miles, there
has not enough rain fallen t.ils season to lay
the dust.
County School Superintendent Crawford
appeared before the board and objected
to his being required to file a bond of
$30,000. His predecessor was required to
file a bond of only $5000.
It now appears that In 1594, when
the resolution fixing the bonds was copied
into the board's minute book, a clerical
error changed the figure from $5000 to $30.
000. This bond stands, and the District
Attorney advised the board to-day that
they could not change the figures and
that Mr. Crawford must provide the
larger bond.
COMPROMISE FOR CARFARE,
Defendants in Justice Hard's Suit
Willing to Pay.
ALAMEDA. Nov. 28.â The defendants
in the suit of Justice of the Peace D. T.
Hard against Constable George Gray and
his bondsmen will file to-morrow in the
Superior Court an offer to compromise
the action. Hard sued for $5000 damages
because the Constable attached his furni
ture and placed a padlock on the court
house door. The defendants offer to set
tle the suit for the munificent sum of 40
cents. The document they will file to
morrow tells its own story:
It appearing that the plaintiff has been a
Justice of the Peare (?) of Alameda Township
for several months, but has nnt lieen able to.
Kather any funds as such, or otherwise, and
It also further appearing that his temple of
Justice was locked from the hour of 7 o'clock
one dark and stormy night and again un
locked the morning following before 8 "'clock;
and it further appearing that times are "hard"
and the plaintiff's character as a Jurist has
been badly shattered by the aforesaid locking
up of his' said temple over night to keep out
burglars; and It further appearing that we
shall be obliged to expend the sum of 40 cents
for car fares to argue demurrers In this case.
we now offer to mnipromise as follows:
Plaintiff to dismiss suit against all defend
ants upon the payment to him of the sum of 40
cents, silver coin of the commonwealth.
R. B, TAPPAX, Attorney for Defendants.
FAVORS WHIPPING POSTS.
Police Judg-e Moore Suggests a Pun-
ishment for Brutal Husbands.
OAKLAND. Nov. 2S.â Police Judge A.
A. Moore Jr. had arraigned before him
to-day Thomas P. Craig, on a charge of
wife-beating. The wife, however, since
her husband's Imprisonment last Friday,
had come to the sad realization that so
long as Craig is in jail bread in her larder
would be scarce, and so she relented, an
nouncing in court to-day that she had
no desire to prosecute her "affectionate
spouse."
His Honor dismissed the case; but not
until he had administered a severe lec
ture, scoring Craig roundly for his un
manly actions. He warned Craig, more
over, that, should he ever again appear
before him only the fullest penalty would
be Imposed.
It was after court had adjourned that
Judge Moore, In his meditative mood, re
marked that he was in favor of the Dela
ware law, establishing a whipping post
for brutal husÃands. That law, said the
Judge, might be enacted here with ad
vantage, so that cruel husbands might be
given some of their own medicine.
Tired of Bread ana Water.
OAKLAND. Nov. 28.â James Floyd, who
is serving six months at the City Prison
for petty larceny, has concluded that it 19
better to work and eat regulation prison
fare than to be idle and have for his re
past only bread and water.
For the past month Floyd has refused
to work about the prison, hence the bread
and water fare. To-day, however, he
"threw up the sponge." and announced to
Captain Carson that he was tired of idle
ness and hunger. During the recent
Grand Jury investigations at the prison
Floyd tried in every way to gain the
jurors' sympathy by telling a tale of
cruelty and starvation, but the Investi
gators heeded him not.
Called Her "Bed Head."
OAKLAND, Nov. .28.â Because little
Johnny Jones called Kate Breys "red
head," she spanked the urchin, and will
now have to appear in the Police Court to
answer a charge of battery, preferred
against her by Johnny Jones' mother.
The defendant had forfeited $10 on the
charge, but was rearrested on complaint
of Mrs. Jones, the forfeiture being set
aside to-day. Mrs. Jones exhibited her
boy's damaged ear as evidence of the
alleged battery, and the case will be heard
on Wednesday.
Mrs. Meggee Pleads Not Guilty.
OAKLAND, Nov. 28.â Mrs. Meggee,
whose name is connected with the Oak
land divorce suit in which Sophie Schoen
felder is plaintiff and John H. Schoen
fcldf-r is defendant, claims, through her
attorney, that she did not reside with
Schoenfelder. She avers that when she
secured a divorce from her husband in
this city some time ago, it was because he
had frequently accused her of improper
conduct with this man Schoenfelder, to
which Meggee made no reply in court or
gave evidence to substantiate his charge.

"THE GUNNEB OF MANILA."
Deserter Neustadt Taken to Mare
Island.
"Gunner" George Neustadt. the desert-
Ing marine from the navy yard, who for
the last month has sailed on a course
around town more lurid than Dewey's cir
cles before the crumbling: Spanish fleet at
Manila, returned to Mare Island In irons
yesterday to meet his superior officer, the
commandant.
During Neustadt's meteoric career in
this city he sent his livery, launch, cigar,
board and lodging bills to that officer, no
tifying him to settle with bearer from the
prize money due the valiant "gunner."
The commandant has yearned to sight his
swell subordinate, to :ind him within the
Mare Island reservation.
When The Call reached the navy ynrd
yesterday morning with the story of Neu
stadt's brilliant cruisings the commands nt
read the first line and called away his
typewriter. The result was an order for
the recreant marine's appearance at the j
yard. Under this order Sergeant Rice of
the Marine Rendezvous, 20 Ellis street,
with a pair of handcuffs, took Neustadt
from the City Prison and started for Mare
Island on the 4 o'clock train. A large
number of creditors and a sprinkling of j
ladies fair â worshipers of brass buttons
are 'eft to remember the yarns of the '
heroic "gunner of Manila."

POLICE GET A
CONFESSION
FROM CREEGAN
"Squeals" on Becker
at Last.
TRYING TO SAVE HIMSELF
CHIEF LEES SAYS NO INDUCE
MENTS WERE OFFERED.
The Prosecution Is Now Confident !
That the Adept Bank Forger
Will Be Again Con
victed.
The Police Department is now more
than confident that Charles Becker, the
dangerous bank forger*, will be convicted
at hi.s thi; forging a 122,000 draft
on the Nevada, Hank. James Creegan,
who was .convicted with JiÂ«cker on the
first trial, fiiffs turned against Becker, and
yesterday; 'be told th< | ill he knew
about the rrini* 1 . The police refose to give
the detaiis of Cruan's confession, as it
would put ' â¢ ssiop of the
new evidence before it is given in court.
Creegan's testimony, added to that of
Fnirik Deane > who turned State's evi
dence when tfi,e trio were arrested, and
on w;:- â¡ pny Becker and Creegan
wrre once convicted, will undoubtedly,
send the notorious forger to prison for
life.
Creegan has bopn one of Backer's part
ners fur years and they have perpetrated
many gigantic bank forgeries.. Besides
Informing toe police of the details of the
Nevada Bank deal Greegan is believed to
have "peached" on a number of other
transactions in which he participated with
Beok.-r.
"When Deane testified against his part
ners in the nrst trial fMape Wallace laid
down the rules of evidence that an accom
plice's test-mony could not be considered
unless it was corroborated. The evidence
given by LÂ»eane. though almost unsup
ported, secured a conviction. The police
now declare that Creegan has furnished
all the necessary collateral links to make
the chain around Becker so strong that
nothing can prevent a conviction. Cree
gan is the only man who saw Becker
raise the Woodland draft from $12 to $22,
000, and he has placed the police in a po
sition to secure all the corroborative evi
dence to establish when and where the
work was done, me materials used and
â where they were outalned.
Oreegan now occupies the "parlor" cell
at the City Prison with Deane. He was
taken to court yesterday, but did not re
turn to the County Jail, where he had
been the cellmate of Becker. During the
afternoon, and again last night, the new
witness had long conferences with Chief
Lees. The Chief, however, would not
disclose the purpose of the interviews
Nevertheless he emphatically declared
that the case against Becker had been
greatly strengthened.
Becker declined to talk about Creegari's
"squealing," saying only that he had
an inkling that he would do so. The
third trial of this famous case Is set for
Thursday morning.
Mr. Ach, attorney for tHe prosecution,
wa3 seen last night, and claimed that he
did not know Creegan had turned State's
ADVEBTISEMiINTS.

My little sister (Annie Matthews, La Plata,

of large sores which he scratched constantly.

evidence. "I heard the rumor this even
ing." he said, "but whether it is true I can
not say. As far as 1 know, there has been
no inducement offered Creegan to Rive
testimony against Becker, and as far as I
am concerned I would prefer he did not
turn State's evidence. I am firmly con
vinced that with an honest jury 1 can con
vict both Becker and Creegan."
Only rumors of Creegan's determination
to turn State's evidence have reached
Messrs. Dunne & McPike, the attorneys
who have fought so long and hard to se-.
cure the acquittal of the two forgers.
IV-ter P. Dunne, the senior member of tne
firm said :
"I am as much in the dark about this
as anybody else. All I- know about it is
this: Tho trial of Becker and Cretan
was set for this morning in Judge Wal
lace's court.
"After the proceedings in court to-day
were concluded Becker was taken back
to the County Ja'J, while Creegan was
locked up In the City Prison.
"Soon after Becker reached the County
Jai! he sent for either Mr. McPike or my
self to go and see him. Mr. McPike went
to the jail and to him Becker confided his
fears, that Creegan' intended to make a
confession, his fears being based solely
on the fact that Oreegan had been taken
to the City Prison instead of being re
turned to his old quarters in the County
Jail.
"Creepran is a young man, not vet 40
years old, and believes that if he is con
victed on this trial Judge Wallace will
again sentence him to life imprisonment.
lie has now been in jail about three years
and it is reasonable to suppose he would
resort to almost any means to escape
spending the remainder of his life behind
iron bars.
"Becker Is regarded by the police as the
most dangerous man of the lot by far,
and they would make almost any conces
sion to the others in order to secure the
conviction of Becker, and if they have
promised Creegan his freedom in return
for a confession it is a great temptation
to a man in his position."
I wish to publicly thank the president
j and directors of the Hibernia Bank fur

offering my property, or any of it, for

HIGHBINDERS NOW SCARCE.
Appearance of Lieutenant of Police Price Drives
Them to Their Hovels.
THE frequent cases of murder and assault in Chinatown have at last
aroused Chief of Police Lees and the Chinese Consul to sensible action.
Both agreed that something must be done, and accordingly Lieutenant
of Police William Price has been detailed to preserve the peace and
to prevent a repetition of such murderous scenes. The squad under Ser
geant McManus will not be replaced, but will simply be reinforced by
Price and his men, as they were not capable, single handed, of controlling
the terrors of the Celestial quarter.
Since the appearance of Price, highbinders have kept under shelter, and
not one of them has shown his face in any of the alleys or the Sheets
The Mongolians have a wholesome fear of the lieutenant, as on one occa
sion several years ago he entered a den in which a number of murderers
and criminals had gathered, and routed them in such an effective fashion
that the residence of many of them in this city became a memory on the
day following. Lieutenant Price is their bogie man.
THE SAX FRANCSICO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1898.
DARING CRIME
OF A DAYLIGHT
HOUSEBREAKER
Enters a Sutter-Street
Residence.
STEALS VALUABLE JEWELRY
DISCOVERED BY A SERVANT, HE
MAKES HIS ESCAPE,
He Was Seen by a Citizen, Who Has
Given the Police a Good
Description of
Him.
An unusually daring burglary was com
mitted yesterday afternoon at the resi
dence of Alexander George, 794 Sutter
street.
Shortly after noon Mrs. George went
shopping, leaving Miss Olsen, the servant,
in charge of the house. The latter was in
the kitchen preparing dinner when she
heard a peculiar noise upstairs. Suspect
ing something wrong she went to her
room and was surprised to find the win
dow open. A subsequent examination
showed that her gold watch, a pair of
valuable earrings and a purse, contain
ing a small sum of money, were gone.
The daring burglar had climbed through
the window and at once proceeded to
search the room for valuables.
After securing the watch and earrings,
which were carelessly left on the bureau,
he broke open the drawers, but failing
to find anything of value, he proceeded to
the next room. While ransacking it he
dropped some heavy instrument on tho
floor, which attracted the attention of the
servant.
As she ran upstairs he evidently became
alarmed and hurriedly left the premises.
The servant lost no time in notifying
the policeman on the beat, who proceed
ed to make an investigation. He found
that the burglar had forced open the win
dow, presumably with a jimmy. It is
probable he saw Mrs. George leave the
house.
Last night Miss Olsen visited police
headquarters and gave a description of
the stolon property. She suspects onr> of
the pang of laborers who are employed
In repairing a hmi.se adjoining the one
occupied by George and his wife. Ac
cordmg to hor story she fastened the
window of her room immediately after
Mrs. George had left the premises. She
then went downstairs to the kitchen, and
a f< w minutes later her attention was at
tracted by a- peculiar noise in her room-
As she reached h.-r apartment she saw
the foot of a man protruding through
the open window. Going to the bureau
she at once missed her jewelry, and lustily
shouted for help. By this time the bur
glar had disappeared. A citizen who was
passing at tho time saw the housebreaker
running down the street.
The police have a description of him
and every effort will be made to run him
down.

THE TIVOLI'S
CYRANO NOT
A GAY JEST
It Is Cleverly Scened
and Directed.
STEVENS A HAPPY SURPRISE*
"SECRET SERVICE" REOPENS
AND CROWDS CALIFORNIA.
"Gay Manhattan" at the Columbia.
Comedy and Melodrama Pre
sented in the Other
Theaters.
There was a crowd In the Tivoli last
night to witness the second local pro
duction of "Cyrano de Bergerac." It
was a good-natured crowd, easy and
affable and prepared for the worst that
might happen. After the "Cyrano" ex
periences in Bush street last week only
one thing could have surprised thaÂ£
crowd â a good performance of poor
Rostand's much be-actored master
piece. And happy to relate the crowd
; was surprised; the performance was
good. It was tastefully, even beautiful
ly scened; the stage direction was sane
and artistic, and the acting was quite
good enough to give one a fair idea
of the drama in English.
After jollying the idea of a Tivoli
"Cyrano" as I have done I blush to
write these kind words. But the truth
must be told. As the Sheriff said to the
woman whose husband he had hanged
by mistake. "The joke is on me."
Really, you are given a very decent
Idea of the spring, spirit and fantastic
romance of "Cyrano de Bergerac ' by
the performance at the Tivoli. ( tf
course to know "Cyrano" at the best [
you should read the book; after that
see the Coquelin or the Mansfield pro
duction; but if you can't wait for either
of these then plunge for a half-dollor's
worth at the Tivoli. Personally, I
should have been satisfied with read-
Ing the book and waiting for Mans
field, but the local managers are less
patient. The name "Cyrano de Ber
gerac" stands for all that is gloriously
and gratuitously advertised in the mod
ern theatrical world; and the play is
to every manager in this country (ex
cept Mansfield, who chose to pay a roy
alty) as free as air. New masterpieces
that are world-wide in popularity and
free don't happen oftener than once in
a lifetime; so the little managers go In
for "Cyrano" productions with the same
amiable enterprise that inspires other
merchants to offer their patrons "Cy
rano" cigars and "Cyrano" hair re
storers.
When the Tivoli people announced a
serious production with their principal
comic onera comedian in the leading
part, I saw only the funny, mercenary
Bide of it. Hence those "joshes," which
are now on me. While I am not obliged
to say that the freeness and commercial
charm of "Cyrano" were ignored by
the Tivoli management, I can say in all
integrity that that management went
about its business in a quiet, thorough
business like way. George Lask. the
stage manager, was sent East to ob
serve the Mansfield and Daly produc
tions, to find where cuts could be made
and where they could not,, and to get
the plans of the costumes and scenery.
And if there is a man in this town who
knows his business his name is George
Lask. The management was generous,
and he got up a production that is more
than creditable in the circumstances,
and in many ways artistic. The Tivoli
Instead of hurting the popular interest
in "Cyrano" has done it good; and for
several weeks to come "Cyrano" will
quicken the popular interest in the Tiv
oli.
Now for the acting, which Is the real
surprise; anybody with time and
money and workmen can get up a well
dressed stage. Edwin Stevens plays
the long-nosed title part, and plays it
well. Ido not mean that he plays
it well for 50 cents or for a comic opera
comedian, but just plain "well." He
has given thought and study not only
to the part, but to the whole play, and
he has caught something of the de
lightfully extravagant atmosphere and
of the poetic glow. He does not give
to the character all the recklessness
and ring nor all the emotional warmth
that are in it, because there are limits
to his temperament which are easily
reached in this part. But he does read the
lines with authority and imagination
and with almost faultless enunciation,
and his impersonation is always con
sistent and always interesting.
One improvement I might suggest,
and that is that in the love scenes he
affect less of what for lack of a readier
term I may, call the "baby voice." It is
an old trick, this, and one that I have
never seen done with success, and it
was the only regrettable feature ofhis
work in the balcony scene. In the duel,
in the recitation of the "Gay Cadets,"
and in the overwhelmingly difficult
"moon" scene where the singing voice
is employed much as Ophelia's is in the
mad scene in "Hamlet," Mr. Stevens
was admirable. He played with brains
and appreciation, and bar the one
fault already mentioned his perform
ance was a success, a success qualified
only by the temperamental limitations
vi the player.
The souvenirs of the recent comic
opera season were few and confined
mainly to the highly-costumed think
ing parts and a paragraph in the pro
gramme printed in the middle of the
cast which said "the management re
spectfully announces to the audience
that a Napa soda lemonade is deli
cious." All costumed crowds are more
or less silly, even in the best regulated
romantic performances, and this one
will do better in a night or two. Elvia
Crox buries her opera-bouffe past very
effectually in Roxane, but she ingenues
the part too much. Roxane was young
and tender and may be she had the
gum-drop voice, but she was also some
thing of a blue-stocking. However,
Miss Crox is to be vigorously praised
for her acquittal of the scene with Cy
rano at the pastry cook's; the parting
especially she did with delicacy and in
genuousness. The rest of the cast is
serviceable and effective, without re
quiring individual comment.
All-in-all, this low-priced "Cyrano"
Is a glad surprise and a lovely vindica
tion for Edwin Stevens a.nd the Tivoli.
ASHTON STEVENS.
Columbia.
Koster & Bial's musical extravaganza,
"Gayest Manhattan," in three acts,
opened at the Columbia last evening. The
piece, like "In Gay New York," "A Round
of Pleasure," "The Whirl of the Town"
and many' other extravaganzas, la a pot
pourri of situationless situations inter
woven into a mass of nonsense. Thero
are enough songs, music and specialties to
give the piece life, but the quality of its
existence is not necessarily approved by
artistic merit. There is a superfluity of
songs, alleged to be topical, but there are
not more than three that one would care
to hear twice. The audience was by no
means pronounced In its approval of the
first net, hut in the second and third the
piece livens up a bit. "For Sweet Char
ity's Sake." sunp by Misses Octavie Barbe
and Jessica Duncan, in the first act, and a
musical quintet in the second entitled,
"Will Somebody Tell Me Why," came in
for several encores. On. the whole the
audience were apparently pleased â with
"Gayest Manhattan. " It is here for two
weeks.
California.
Phoenix-like, "Secret Service" has risen
from the ashes of the Baldwin Theater,
nnd in new grarb and with fresh scenery
opened its second week at the California
last evening. The audience was larsre,
fashionable and duly appreciative of Mr.
Gillette's war romance. It is but a repeti
tion to say that "Secret Service" was
ag-aln presented with perfect complete- 1
ness, and that its intense situations and
norvp-wrenching climaxes held the indi
vidual interest and attention of the audi
ence. After a week of enforced rest the
members of the company were appreci
ably enerpetic and faithful, and in con
sequence the realism of the stirring drama
was more forcible than ever. "Secret
Service" will be at the California the re
mainder of the week.
Alcazar.
The. clever stock company at the Alca
zar gave a capital presentation last night
of Roland Rood's satirical comedy, "The
Politician." The plot is simple and hinges
upon the devices adopted by General
Limber, the politician, to defeat his
enemy. Meggs, in the nomination for Con
gress. A lot of comical situations are
evolved which cause no end of fun.
Clarence Montaine, as the politician, had
to do most of the work, and he did it well.
George Osbdurne, as the simple old gen
tleman who h:id the misfortune to be se
lected as the nominee of the general, was
excellent, and Ernest Hastings had an op
portunity of displaying his versatility as
the swell member of the Coaching Club,
"just from abroad, you know." Gretchen
Lyons was an excellent type of the ad
vocate of woman's rights, and Laura
Clews and Marie Howe, as the daughter
and sister of thp general's nominee, were
pleasing. The other parts were well sus
tained.
New Comedy.
"Cyrano de Bergerac," as played by
Edward Bell and the Henderson Compa
ny, is still the attraction at the Com
edy. "Ole Olson" comes Monday. Alf
Ellinghouae has resigned from the man
agerial offices of the Comedy to devote
his Labors to a publication called "The
atricals."
Orpheum.
Between the newcomers and the hold
overs the Orpheum bill is unusually
strong this week.
Morosco's.
"The Commodore," a naval melodrama
founded on incidents of the war with
Spain, was produced for the first time
in this city last evening at Morosco's
Grand Opera House.
Olympia.
The Olympia Music Hall has a strong
attraction in Freada, the twirling Turk
ish dancer.
The Chutes.
The damp and drizzly evening was not
conducive to a large house at the Chutes
Free Theater, but the new programme
was thoroughly enjoyed from beginning
to end. J '-*â 
MOTION TO DISMISS

CONVICTION.
Acting District Attorney Hinkle ap
peared before Judge Cook yesterday and
made a motion that the various charges

ground that there was not sufficient evi
dence to convict. In support of the mo
tion the following letter from District
Attorney Barnes was read:

conviction in any of them. The death of
Isaac Hoffman has removed not only an im
portant but an essential witness for the prose
cution. The rule established by the Supreme
Court in cases of this character requires the
prosecution to establish affirmatively that the
signature of Isaac Hoffman is not his genuine
handwriting and was in fact written by Figel,
anil also that Mr. Huffman did not authorize,
empower or sanction this use of his name by
the defendant, and disproof cannot be
furnished, nor does an examination of the
evidence taken on the preliminary examination
of the defendant disclose any facts from which
the principal fact can be reasonably inferred
or which overcomes the presumptions arising 1
from them.
The game conditions of farts and law are
found In the charges of embezzlement The
trial of these cases would naturally fte pro
tracted. The preliminary examination occu
pied several months and was exceedingly ex
pensive to the Ptate. There is no reason to
believe that trials would be less costly, and
Indeed it may be assumed that they will .>o
m<">re expensive than they hitherto have been
and this without any reasonable expeotat r. n
of conviction, or affirmance of any conviction
if it should be had by the Superior Court.
In view of these facts you are directed to
move the court to dismiss these cases referred
to, and each of them. I have reason to be
lieve that this course will meet with no objec
tion from special counsel hitherto engaged to
prosecute them, but who have now withdrawn
from further connection with them. Respect
fully yours. WILLIAM S. BARNES,
District Attorney of the City and County of
San Francisco, State of California.
Judge Cook refused to decide the case
Immediately and took the matter under
advice. It is thought, however, that the
cases will be stricken from the calendar
at an early date.
A SECOND TRIAL
FOR THE FARRAGUT
IRVING M. SCOTT IS CONFIDENT
OF HER SUCCESS.
The new torpedo boat Farragut is pre
paring for another trial sprint on the bay.
Word has been received from Washington
that the Navy Department would order
the Inspection officers aboard when the
little flyer was ready for a second test.
On the first trial she fell a fraction under
the required thirty knots. She made over
that speed on parts of the Course, but
for the full hour she lost twenty seconds.
She should have made 417 propeller revo
lutions per minute for the hour's ruji, but
she averaged 147 revolutions short. As
her maximum number of revolutions is
435 it is plain to be seen that the little
craft could have easily come up to the
required 417 revolutions.
Irving Scott stated last evening that
something like 270 revolutions was the
number believed necessary to send the
boat over the run In the required time,
but the force of the wind blowing at the
time over portions of the course materi
ally retarded tho vessel. The depth of the
water also affected her moflon.
The hull of a vessel moving at a high
speed pushes a volume of water with her
not only on each side but under her keel.
If the depth be great the force of this
wave will expend itself, but when it
strikes the bottom of the bay it drags and
holds back considerably the moving hull.
Mr. Scott was asked why he did not take
the Farragut to- Santa Barbara Channel
for her trial. There the water is deep
and in every way suitable for a continu
ous run.
"That is true," he said, "but it Is un
necessary to do so. The boat is good for
those missing twenty seconds right here
in San Francisco Bay. It has been inti
mated that the boat had failed in her offi
cial trial and in all probability would be
rejected by the Government. This is in
correct, as there is no limit to the tests
nor the time of those trials. The greater
the tests of her endurance the. better boat
she will have proved herself to be. pro
viding she comes up" to her required speed.
And she will, depend on that. Only twen
ty seconds. She needs twenty fathoms of i
water under her and 147 more revolutions
per minute and the Farraput is the best
craft in the worldâ a worthy little sister
of the San Francisco, Olympia, Oregon I
and Wisconsin, and, in fact, of everything
California workmen have sent afloat. The
Farragut will be In commissfon one day
ready for any work Uncle Sam has for
her to do.
"During her first trial, with a maximum
propeller revolution of sometimes 435 over
parts of the run. she logged thirty-one
knots. This showing was, of course, made
to the Navy Department, and the request
for more tests, of course, granted. The
Farragut is all right."
