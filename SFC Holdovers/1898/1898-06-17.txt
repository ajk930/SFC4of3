VOLUME LXXXIV.-NO. 17.
CRATER BLOWN OUT OF CAYO SMITH
MAKING READY TO
INVADE PORTO RICO.
WASHINGTON. June 16.â
The War Department ex
pects to utilize approxi
mately thirty-five trans
ports in the expedition for
the invasion of Porto Rico.
This statement was made
officially at the depart
ment. It seems to indicate
that the Porto Rico army
will equal, if not exceed, trje
nun)ber which" left for San
tiago. The estimate is
made that the thirty-five
vessels will carry between
15,000 and 20,000 men witrj
their equipments and sub
sistence.
Army officials say that
the reports which, have
beer) received from reliable
sources show that the
number of Spanish soldiers
in that country is only 10,
000 men, although other
statements indicate that
there is considerably less
than that nurober. It is fair
to assume, they say, that
when the United States
arroy commences active
operations against tr)e city
of San Juan every available
mar) in that place will be
impressed into military
service and given a gun.
hjence they feel that the
army of invasion should be
of such proportions as to
leave no doubt of its abil
ity and capacity to cope
successfully with) the Span
iards.
It is stated positively tbat
the embarkation point for
tt)e troops for Porto Rico
has not beer) finally deter
mined yet, and until Secre
tary Alger and the Prssi
dent have had an oppor
tunity to confer with) Gene
ral Miles, who will return to
the city to-morrow, it will
not be determined.
for the purposes of the
Porto Rican expedition. Sec
retary MeiMejohn said to
day that the department
had now available eleven
transports, some of which
are already at Southern
ports, and these Will carry
about 6000 rr)en with their
equipments.
ON BOARD THE ASSOCI
ATED PRESS DISPATCH
BOAT DAUNTLESS (off
Santiago de Cuba), Thurs
day, Noon, June !6,via King
ston, Jamaica, June 16, 9
P. M. â Rear Admiral Samp
son's fleet bombarded the
batteries at Santiago de
Cuba for the third time at
daylight this morning. For
hours the ships pounded the
batteries at the right and
left of the entrance, only
sparing El Morro, where
Lieutenant Hobson and his
companions are in prison.
The western batteries, against
which the main assault was di
rected, were badly wrecked. One
was utterly destroyed. In others
% many guns were dismounted.
At first the Spaniards replied
furiously, but wildly and impo
tently. Then most of the guns
were deserted. Xot a ship was
struck nor a man injured on the
American side.
It is believed the enemy's loss
of life was heavy.
As a preliminary to the ham
mering given the batteries, the
dynamite cruiser Vesuvius last
night, at midnight, was given an
other chance. Three 250-pound
charges of guncotton were sent
over the fortifications at the en
trance. The design was to drop
them in the bay around the an
gle, back of the eminence on
which El Morro is situated,
where it was known the torpedo
boat destroyers were lying. Two
charges went true â as no reports
were heard â a peculiarity of the
explosion of guncotton in
water.
Whether the destroyers
were demolished is not
known, but the destructive
area of guncotton Is lerge
and it would not be surpris
ing If one or both torpedo
boats were destroyed. The
third charge exploded with
terrific force on Cayo Smith.
The San Francisco Call
TJÂ£E BATTLE NEAR CAMP MeCALLA, GUANTANAMO HILLS, ON ;
TUESDAY LAST.
Our Marines, Advancing From Three Sides at Once, Drove the Spaniards, Though in Superior Force, in Utter Confusion From Their
Camp and Water Supply.
For the Third Time Admiral Sampson's Ships
Bombard Santiago's Batteries.
From where the fleet lay the
; entrance to the harbor looked, in
the black night, like a door open
ing into the livid fire of a Titanic
furnace.
A crater big enough to
hold a church was blown out
of the side of theCayoSmith
battery and wasclearly seen
from the ships this morning.
Admiral Sampson issued the
orders for the bombardment last
night. Coffee was served to the
men at half past 3 this morning
; and with the first blush of dawn
I the men were called quietly to
quarters.
The ships steamed at a five
knot speed to a 3000-yard range,
when they closed up, broadside
on, until a distance of three cable
lengths separated them. They
were strung out in the form of a
crescent, the heavy fighting ships
in the center, the flagship on the
right and the Massachusetts on
the left flank. The' line remained
stationary throughout the bom
bardment. The Vixen and Scorp
ion took up positions .on opposite
flanks, close in shore, for the pur
pose of enfilading any infantry
that might fire upon the ships.
When the ships got into posi
tion it was still too dark for any
firing.
The admiral signaled the
ships not to fire until the
muzzles of the enemy's guns
in the embrasures could be
seen by the gun captains.
Fifteen minutes, later, at 5 125
a. m., the New York opened with
a broadside from her main bat
tery at the works on the east of
the entrance to the harbor. All
the ships followed in streaks of
flame. The fleet, enveloped in
smoke, pelted the hills and^

kicked up dirt and masonry. It
was a magnificent spectacle from
where the Dauntless lay.
Though the gun captains had
been cautioned not to waste am
munition, but to fire with delib
eration, the fire was so rapid that
there was an almost continuous
report. The measured crash of
the big 13-inch guns of the bat
tle-ships sounded above the rat
tle of the guns of the secondary
batteries like thunder claps above
the din of a hurricane. A strong
land breeze off shore carried the
smoke of the ships seaward,
while it let down a thick curtain
in front of the Spanish gunners.
The Dons responded spir
itedly at first, but their fren
zied half-crazed fire could
not match the cool nerve,
trained eyes and skilled
gunnery of the Americans.
Our fire was much more ef
fective than in preceding
bombardments.
The admiral's ordnance ex
pert had given explicit directions
to reduce the powder charges and
to elevate the guns so as to
shorten the trajectory and thus
to secure a plunging fire. As
the shells in the preceding bom
bardments dropped w r ith the al
most straight trajectories of pro
jectiles, with full charges, it was
almost impossible to plant them.
They would shoot into the air,
encircling the batteries, owing to
the high elevation, and fall far
over the fortifications. The ef
fect of the reduced charges was
marvelous.
In fifteen minutes the western
battery was completely wrecked.
The Massachusetts tore a gaping
hole in the emplacement with a
thousand-pound projectile, and
the Texas dropped a shell into
the powder magazine. The ex
plosion wrought terrible havoc.
The frame was lifted, the sides
were blown out and a shower of
debris flew in every direction.
One timber carried out of
the side of the battery went
tumbling down the hill. The
loss of life must have been
great.
The batteries on the east of
Morro were harder to get at, but
the New Orleans crossed the
bows of the New York to within
1500 yards off shore and played
a tattoo with her long 8-inch ri
fles, hitting them . repeatedly,
striking a gun squarely muzzle
on, lifting it off its trunnions and
sending it in sweeping somer
saults in the air.
Several times Admiral Samp
son signaled the ships to tempor
arily cease firing, in order to al
low the smoke to clear from the
batteries. When the order came
at 6:30 to cease firing every gun
of the enemy had been silenced
for ten minutes, but as the ships
drew off some of the Spanish
courage returned and a half
dozen shots were fired spitefully
at the Massachusetts and Ore
gon, falling in their wakes.
Throughout the bombardment
the dynamite cruiser Vesuvius
and the Porter, by direction of
the admiral, lay outside of the
right flank. The steam launch
of the flagship scurried among
the ships carrying messages.
At the close of the action a
stream of multi-colored flags
floated from the New York,
greatly complimenting the ships
and especially commending the
work of the Texas and New Or
leans. The men of the New Or
leans raised a cheer which was
passed quickly on from ship to
ship until every Jackie in the fleet
was howling himself hoarse.
The destruction and death
at the western batteries
must have been appalling.
Many of the guns had been
mounted during the last two
days. From this it is inferred
that Admiral Cervera had
given up all hope of extrica
ting himself from the trap in
which he is caught and had
removed the guns from some
of his ships to strengthen the
land defenses.
Admiral Sampson is highly
gratified at the results of the
bombardment. He thinks the
western batteries are practically
demolished. As some of the guns
on the eastern batteries did not
fire he thinks it possible the)
were only dummies.
The only regret expressed
is that Lieutenant Hobson
and his companions by their
presence in El Morro made
it sacred.
Otherwise it would now be a
pile of ruins. The number of
shots fired was not known when
this dispatch was sent. Judging
from a position near the flagship
which, during the bombardment,
with several interruptions, fired
208 shots â 35 from her 8-inch
guns, 134 from her 4-inch guns
and 39 from her 6-pounders â
probably no fewer than 5000 pro
jectiles were fired, of a total
weight of half a million pounds.
THREE BLOCKHOUSES
AT CARDENAS BOMBARDED
Shells Burst Among Spaniards, Caus
ing a Heavy Loss of
Life.
NEW YORK, June 16.â A Key West
special to the Sun says: Spaniards
have recently been at work on three
blockhouses inside the harbor of Car
denas. A gunboat arriving to-day
from the blockade reported that early
this morning the flagship approached
the forts and began bombarding them.
Several other vessels Joined in the
fight. The forts replied. The fight was
just beginning when the gunboat left
the scene to come here.
A dispatch to another morning paper
says several shells were seen to burst
among the Spaniards and It Is certain
the loss of life was heavy.

NEW YORK, June 16.â
John W. Masury, own

shared the troubles of
roany yacht owners who
were abroad when the
war started. The Brun
t)ilde is now tied up in
the harbor of Rio de Ja

Masury paid $2000 to

him to get out to sea.

among the men was terrible. Officers tried
t their companies into line, but the
army of wild horses made that impossi
ble. Many men began shooting at the ex
cited animals, but this only excited them
more.
It seems impossible to stop the stampede
to-night. The horses seemed to be at
tracted by the tents and they rushed
through the brigade of three regiments
and then back again, taking- a different
course each time. They have already de
stroyed many tents, kitchen and camping
paraphernalia.
It is not known what started the horses
on their wild rush. Taps had just sound
ed in all the camps and the bands had
played their good nights. The men were
hardly asleep when a loud cracking like
tne firing of Gatling guns, startled them.
It was the breaking down of the corral
fence, a high wooden affair. In the next
moment the infuriated and panting horse 3
rushed into the New York camp, which
was nearest the break in the fence. The
rush sounded like a thunderstorm. The

Ihe guard hurried out, but it was use
less, as the animals were now rustling
over everything in their path. In half an
hour the camp had been stampeded three
times and there seemed to be no hope of
driving the beasts away from the breach
Forty men were mounted by 11 o'clock'
and they were unable to check the rush '
CUBANS TELL OF

Immediately After War Was De

KEY WEST, Pla., June 16.âLieuten
ant Colonel Augustl Arana, Major Salo
and two privates of the Cuban army
arrived here to-day from Pinar del
Rio with dispatches for the Cuban
Junta. They repoig; that the health of
the Cubans in the field is excellent,
but their food is scarce. The Spaniards,
they say, are 16,000 strong in that prov
ince, but Spain is withdrawing her sol
diers to Havana.
Colonel Arana, who is the chief of
staff of General Pedro Diaz, says the
Cuban forces in the province of Pinar
del Rio number about 5000 men. The
Insurgents hold the north coast of the
province from Bahia Honda to Cape
Antonio. They also hold the entire
south coast, and their mounted fort
resses have never been wrested from
them. Maceo's potato farms have been
kept in cultivation and in the hills in
the southern part of the province are
herds of cattle guarded by men spe
cially assigned to this duty. He says
that immediately after war between the
United States and Spain was declared
the Spanish guerrillas in Pinar del Rio
province went through the country
butchering the paciflcns, women, chil
dren and old men. whose bodies lie in
the roads and fields unburled to this

The Mortality Among the Spaniards Behind the
Defenses Reported to Have Been Very
Great.
ON BOARD the Herald-Call
Dispatch-Boat Sommers X.
Smith off Guantanamo, June 15,
via Kingston, Jamaica, June 16.
It is evident that the Spaniards
do not intend quietly to abandon
the positions they took when the
American marines were landed
on Cuban soil six days ago. They
have been driven inland day af
ter day, but are assembling addi
tional forces every hour and are
preparing to make a fresh as
sault upon the American de
fenses.
The Spanish gunboats in the
inner harbor have been hard at
work carrying troops across the
bay to surround our men. This
work was watched from Camp
McCalla by the American offi
cers. It continued all day. As
soon as the Spanish soldiers were
landed on the eastern shore they
vanished in the woods. There is
little doubt that these troops are
being sent to a common rendez
vous for a concerted attack
against our forces, either in mass
or by night surprises.
The defenses of the camp are
being strengthened hourly. Lieu
tenant Colonel Huntington evi
dently expects fighting at close
quarters, for when I left his camp
he was sharpening his sword on
a grindstone.
The activity of the enemy led
to several engagements during
the day in Guantanamo Bay.
Early this morning a considera
ble number of Spanish soldiers
appeared on the western side of
the harbor and were about to be
ferried across to the eastern side
on the gunboats that had been
anchored in the inner harbor.
This movement was anticipated
by Admiral Sampson, who sent
the Texas to join the Marble
head and Suwanee at this point.
When the Spaniards began the
work of transferring their men
across the inner bay the Texas,
Marblehead and.suwanee steam
ed to the mouth of the inlet and
opened a lively fire with their
heaviest guns at a range of 500
yards. The first shot fired by the
Texas was answered by the
Spaniards in the fort, who put a
shot between the Texas and the
Marblehead. They then sent an
other shell across the bow of the
Marblehead, narrowly missing
the American. Four more Span
ish shots struck the water near
our warships during the next fif
teen minutes, but after that time
nothing more was heard from the
enemy's fort. The Spanish troops
and gunboats were out of range,
so the movement toward the ma
rines' camp could not be stopped
by the warships.
Shot aFter shot sent by the
American vessels hit the
Spanish Fort, however, near
the entrance to the inner
harbor, and the building
eventually was completely
demolished. The mortality
among the Spaniards must
have been very jtreak
While our vessels were
thus engaged the enemy be
gan to fire from the south
side of the bay, near the
town of Caimanera. The
gunsof the Marblehead were
trained in that direction and
the firing from the land was
silenced in short order. The
Marblehead did not cease
firing as soon as the enemy
did, but kept banging away
until heavy damage had
been done in the town.
This bombardment lasted an
hour and a half and our ships
then steamed back into the outer
bay, having silenced the forts
about Caimanera.
As the American vessels re
turned toward Camp McCalla a
submarine mine came to the sur
face close to the Marblehead.
Captain McCalla shouted to the
Smith and other boats in the vi
cinity, warning them to look out.
He sent a launch to capture the
mine.
After the mine had been re
covered and while it was being
towed by a boat from the Mar
blehead, the Americans were
again fired on from the shore.
Two hundred yards away they
saw the enemy huddled together
in some brush. The Marblehead's
launch returned the fire and the
Suwanee swung alongside and
drenched the woods where the
Spanish were with a hail of lead.
During this skirmish the
launch from the Marblehead did
fine work. Her one-pounders
threw out shells so rapidly that
one of the men and one of the
guns fell overboard. The man
was rescued.
The St. Paul, which was an
chored outside the bay during
the bombardment, became in
volved in an engagement with a
body of Spaniards who had taken
a position in the woods within
rifle fire. The St. Paul poured
out a heavy fire from her small
guns and put the Spaniards to
flight.
Marines on the outpost of
Camp McCalla this morning saw
a man in the brush waving a
handkerchief. They started to
investigate and the man ran
away. He presently plucked up
courage and returned. He was
found to be a Spanish soldier.
After he had surrendered he told
an interesting story. He said he
was one of twenty men sent
around the mountain to surprise
the men on the Marblehead. He
had been for forty-eight hours
without food or water. He be
came disgusted with his lot, he
said, and decided he could be no
worse off with the Americans
than he was with the Spaniards,
so he decided to surrender.
After eating like a wolf, he
said he was one of many vouner
Spaniards who had fought in the
war, having been drafted. Upon
reporting for army duty, he con
tinued, he found there was little
food for the soldiers^ that they.

were badly treated, and were be
ing paid no wages. Many others
were ready to surrender, but were
told by the officers that the
Americans would slaughter them
mercilessly. The prisoner also
declared the Spaniards were
massing for an attack on Camp
McCalla. and that they were try
ing to bring field artillery to bear
on the American position. As
there was no attack last night our
men suspect some surprise is be
ing prepared by the enemy. They
assert, however, they are not
afraid of any number of Span
iards who may be seTit against
them.
They placed a three-inch field
gun and a Colt's rapid fire moun
tain battery on a hill during a
temporary cessation of hostilities
and now are prepared to give the
Spaniards a warm welcome. The
Americans spent the morning
cutting and burning the under
growth about the camp to de
stroy the hiding places to which
the enemy .resorted during the
opening engagements. The Span
ish troops are not expected to
fight in the open, as they are
practically helpless if they have
nothing behind which to hide.
The funeral of Juan Suarez,
one of the Cubans killed in yes
terday's engagement, took place
this morning, and was very im
[ - essive. The body was taken to
the Dolphin and there sewed in
canvas. The Cuban compatriots
then brought the body ashore
and, wrapping an American flag
about it, proceeded up the hill,
followed by sailors and a detach
ment of marines. The body was
laid fifty yards from the trenches
and Captain McCalla read the bu
rial service. The squad then pull
ed the triggers of their guns, but
no cartridges were used in order
not to draw the Spanish fire. The
men then marched away, leaving
half a dozen behind to dig the
grave and lower the body.
NO FURTHER FEARS
FOR THE MARINES
Officials at Washington Expect Im
portant News Shortly From
General Shafter.
WASHINGTON, June 16.â The offi
cials are resting secure in the belief
that the marines at Guantanamo can
easily maintain themselves until the
troops arrive.
The officials in the War Department
do not give out any specific informa
tion as to when General Shafter will
land in Cuba, but from certain signs
of restlessness exhibited by them It is
evident that they would not be sur
prised to have some very Important
news within the next twenty-four or
thirty-six hours. The naval officials
are confident Sampson. will re-establish
cable communication within that time
so news of the American ships off San
tiago should not be longer delayed than
the time required for a dispatck-boat
to make the run of forty miles east

EVANS WILL
BE APPOINTED
Named for Collector of

IT WILL ADHERE TO INTER-
NATIONAL LAW.
Outline of the Military Law for the
Government of the Philippine
Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, June 16.
The announcement made exclusively
in The Call last week that the Presi
dent had decided to appoint a Col
lector of Customs at Manila, and that
Joseph F. Evans of San Francisco
would be the man selected for this im
portant post, was verified to-day when
the nomination of Mr. Evans to be
commissary of subsistence, with the
rank of captain, was sent to the Sen
ate. It is understood that it is the
intention of the Treasury Department
to have Mr. Evans sail with General
Merritt on the third expedition to the
islands.
A proclamation by the President, as
commander-ln-chief of the United
States army, is now being prepared,
and, unlike most documents, It will
not be attested by the Secretary of
State, but by the Secretary of War, for
Instead of being a state document It
is a military proclamation. In the
preparation of this paper the form of
international law Is followed, for since
a military government is to be estab
lished in the Philippines the laws be
tween nations must be observed. Whar
ton, the recognized authority on inter
national law, embraces in this code
of nations all laws formed for provis
ional governments. This proclamation
will follow closely general order No.
101, promulgated by Secretary Stanton
in 1863. In the collection of Philippine
duties the Spanish tariff now in vogue
will be closely adhered to, although
certain oppressive international taxes
will be abolished. The import and ex
port duties will remain much the same
as at present. It is a singular fact
that while the constitution of the
United States expressly forbids the
laying or collection of an export duty
it will be levied and collected under
the proposed Philippine regime, for un
der military government, based upon
international law, it nas always been
the custom to continue in force laws as
nearly as possible like that of the
Government which it superseded, so
that trade "amongst the family of na
tions will not be disturbed." Thus,
the export tax will be continued for a
time at least, so that no injury will re
sult to the mercantile interests of any
nation.
In transmlttine: the new tariff to the
President the Secretary makes some in
teresting observations as to the spirit
of the new code ;of customs,' and in
very frank terms gives ' his â  reasons i for
the modifications of the present Span
ish-tariff which, have been made by the
department. In acknowledging the re
ceipt of the President's request for the
drafting. of the tariff schedules the Sec
retary repeats the :- President's .' state
ment that the schedules are designed to
enable the United States to secure from
the trade of the Philippines a portion
of the funds *â  necessary ; to : ; defray ; the
jexDenaea of. tho civil niUHaur Â£sÂ»
tablishment to be maintained in the
islands, "pending their ultimate dispo
sition." The basis of the new tariff
is the draft of the present Spanish cus
toms schedules as supplied to the de
partment by the International Bureau of
Customs at Brussels, but certain im
portant departures from this code have
been made for reasons set forth by the
Secretary- The export charges levied
on certain articles produced in the Phil
ippine Islands the department has not
thought it wise to continue, and it has
also been deemed advisable to elimi
nate certain shipping charges which are
regarded as too severe a tax upon com
merce, and especially as likely to limit
or decrease the revenue to be derived
from the customs schedules. In clos
ing his letter the Secretary makes a
highly significant observation with re
gard to the exemptions provided In the
Spanish schedule which have been
eliminated from the new code. These
cover the entry free of duty of all ar
ticles imported by or for th" use of th?
Catholic church in the Philippine Isl
ands, and in diplomatic terms the Sec
retary states that this feature of the
code had been stricken out, as !t is rot
the purpose of the Government to dis
criminate in favor of "any religious so
cieties."
The latest estimate of the receipts
from the Philippine tarfff is givf-n by
the Treasury Department at $20,000,000
per annum. It is calculated that the
fact that a state of war exists in the
islands will cause a diminution in cus
toms collections which will be practi
cally offset by the more or less spec
ulative tariff directed toward the isl
ands as the result of the impression
which seems to have gained general
currency that large opportunities exist
for making money.

advanced, that is settled. The depart
ment called upon Sampson for a recom
mendation In this case, but in advance
of its arrival had about decided to ad
vance Hobson ten numbers, which
would have placed him Just below
Constructor Linnard, when a doubt
arose as to whether the young man
would not prefer a transfer to the line.
His relatives were consulted, among
them his uncle, Representative Pear
son of North Carolina, and it was de
cided to allow Hobson to make his
choice as between the line and staff.
Steps accordingly have been tak^n to
acquaint him with the department's
purpose and ask his pleasure in the
matter.

CopyrlÃhted, ISHS, hy James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, June 16. â A curious rumor
is current here regarding 1 the reserve
squadron at Cadiz. It is that not only
is its sailing delayed on account of the
ships not being 1 ready but also because
Admiral Camara, who commands it,
has been acting very strangely of late.
This news is kept officially as secret as
possible, but officers at Cadiz have
noted it and talked over the matter
quite openly.

Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, .une 16.â People here and in
London are wondering why Germany is
collerting such a strong naval force off
Manila. With the arrival there of the
battleship Kaiser she will have four
warships in those waters. There is a
complement of sixteen hundred men on
the vessels alone In addition to a force
of fourteen hundred men to be dls
patched to Cavite on the first of next
month by th.Â» North German Lloyd
transport 1 armstadt. This has at
tracted public attention. Your dis
patches from Berlin recently disclosed
a disposition on the port of Germany
to participate in sharing the cake won
by American pluck. It is felt that Ger
ir.any may try to prevent a change in
the ownership of the archipelago un
less she receives some compensation In
the shape of a naval base.
( >n the other hand England's interests
Me in seeing that Germany does not
â  without an equivalent advantage
for her. There is a decided disposition
to cry -'Hands off. Germany." England
calmly at the possibility of Amer
ica retaining the islands.
The increase in German influence in
the far east, however, will be cora
bated against energetically, and com
plications will result. Japan is said to
covet a concession in the Philippines.
This desire is not regarded favorably
either in England or Germany. The
former is said to contemplate the dis
patch of naval forces to the Philippines
to restore the balance of power of An
glo-faxon influence there.
What, however, comes out clearly, is
that Spain need not cherish the hope
of profiting by German interference.
Should there be any it will be purely
h. Spain's sovereignty there is
universally felt to be over. The only
satisfaction she is likely to get will be
to see European nations snarling at one
another, all through the American vic
tory.

CARIBOU CROSSING, FOOT OP
LAKE BENNETT, Tuesday, May 31
(via Seattle, Wash., June 16).â The flo
tilla sailed from Lake Bennett yester
day. Fully five hundred small boats
took to the water and ran before a
lively breeze to Caribou Crossing. Ths
general movement really began on Sun
day from Bennett. For several days
preceding the fleet there had been
hourly added to by arrivals from Lin
derman. On Sunday the river was
practically cleared from Bennett, and a
hundred or more boats spread sail and
went down the lake.
Yesterday the whole lake was alive
with white sails careening before the
wind. The ice had completely disap
peared from the upper lake and the
little boats ran the narrow channel di
viding the upper and lower lake suc
cessfully and without accident and
then spread away over the long and
narrow expanse to the lower end, where
Is the still narrower channel called Car
ibou Crossing. There the ice had
gorged and there the old familiar scenes
of last fall were repeatedâ the grinding
up of boats and the loss and scattering
of provisions.
The too eager, reckless or witless
pressed into the crush, and In a twink
ling the labor of months . was lost as
the cakea of ice came together upon
them. A dozen small boats were ground
up to-day - and several are reported to
"-â¢Â»Â»â¢â¢ been lost In the same way ye*

WILL NOT PERMIT
GERMAN TROOPS TO LAND
United States Embassy Reported to
Have Made Such a Declaration
at Berlin.
LONDON, June 16.â The Berlin cor
respondent of the Star telegraphs from
the German capital to-day as follows:
The United States Embassy declares to
me that the United States will not per
mit German troops to be landed in the
Philippine Islands. The Germans, the
Americans added, have as little right
to occupy any part of the islands as
they have to occupy New York. Ma
nila and the Philippine Islands, they
point out, are now United States terri
tory.
NO TRUTH IN THE
PERSISTENT RUMORS
The German Embassador Makes As-
surances to the Secretary of
State.
WASHINGTON, June 16.â Herr Yon
Hollenben, the German Embassador,
called upon the Secretary of State to
day and assured him that there was
no truth in the persistent rumors from
London to the effect that Germany in
tended to interfere with the American
Government in the Philippines. The
German Embassador stated further
that his Government was fully deter
mined to maintain an attitude of the
strictest neutrality toward both bel
ligerents during the war.
TO PREVENT DEWEY
FROM BOMBARDING
A German Admiral Said to Have
Gone to Manila on a Ticklish
Mission.
LONDON, June 17.â According to a
special dispatch from Shanghai Admi
ral yon Diedrich, it is officially stated,
left Nagasaki, Japan, for Manila on re
ceipt of instructions from Berlin to pre
vent Admiral Dewey from bombarding
the city and also because Captain Gen
eral Augusti offered the German Con
sul the Caroline Islands as a coaling
station, in case operations should be
undertaken against Manila.
Sailed for Manila.
BERLIN, June 16.â Advices received
here to-day say that the German trans
port Darmstadt has arrived at Kiao
chau Bay and that the German second
class cruiser Princess Wilhelm sailed
yesterday from Nagasaki for Manila,
terday farther down. The police here
report that no less than forty boats
have been wrecked already at White
Horse Rapids and that another case of
suicide has occurred there as a result.
The passage out of the lake is entirely
barred by the jam here. The ice in
Marsh and Mud Lake is said to be still
fixed and solid, but it must certainly
give way in a few days under the warm
sun that is shining every day. Th^n
the big fleet will move down the river.
The Upper Yukon Company's new
steamer, A. J. Goddard, made the round
trip from Bennett to the foot of the
lake, carrying the superintendent of the
company, A. J. Goddard; J. A. Calvert,
secretary; Major J. M. Steele, com
manding the Tapper Yukon post of the
Northwest Mounted Police; Captain J.
W. Raut, government agent at Lake
Bennet; Captain Z. G. Wnnj, North
west Mounted Police; Thomas MrMul
lin, assistant manager of the Canadian
Bank of commerce, Dawsnn, and
Charles King, special agent of the
North Pacific Railroad for Alaska. They
took aboard from a small boat in the
lake A. F. King of New York and J.
WiHison, Crown Timber Agent. It was
the trial tr.p of the Goddard and was
entirely successful. The boat is de-
signed to run regularly from Bennett
to Miles Canyon and return.
The company is building another boat
to run between White Horse Rapids,
the lower end of the canyon, and Daw
son City. With the railroad or tram
way now about completed around the
canyon and White Horse these boats
will make it possible for persons to
travel as mere passengers and with
out encumbering themselves with tents,
stoves and such things from Bennett
to Dawson and back again during the
season when the river is open. Not
everyone should count on this, how
ever, for the Coudard carries but about
fifty passengers. The Ooddard Is ex
pected to make the round trip to the
canyon and return in ten days. The
steamer being built here for the lower
end of the run will have no difficulty,
it is thought, in ascending Five Finger
and Rink rapids.
Many Yukon and other mining celeb
rities are here, prominent figures in the
great spring stampede, among them
"Nigger" Jim, Mr. and Mrs. I. J. Mc-
Kay, J. D. Barnes and wife and Harry
Dobson, all of whom save Mrs. Barnes
came out over the Ice during the winter.
McKay is taking down two barges with
provisions and horses. "Jim" Wardner,
for whom Wardner, Idaho, is named, is
also taking down several barges with
sixty tons of provisions. The Ice is
liable to give way anj' day and admit
of a passage of the fleet anchored here.
The Call's big war edition, comprising
a solid ton of paper, is safe and in the

THE SAX FRAKOISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 17, 1898.
EXECUTION OF
FRANK BELEW
Dixon Poisoner Hanged
at Folsom.
CALMLY ACCEPTS THE NOOSE
MAKES NO STATEMENT
SCAFJfOLD.
Brief Sketch of His Crime and the
Important Part Played by The
Call in Bringing Him to
Justice.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, June 16.â Frank Be
lew, the Dixon poisoner, was hanged at
the Folsoni prison at 10 o'clock thia
morning. He was dead In exactly
eleven and one-half minutes after the
trap was sprung.
He made no confession on the scaf
fold, but yesterday reiterated the state-
FR-A-HSTK belew,
ment he had made after his arrest, in
which he owned to the murder of his
brother and sister. He added the as
sertion, however, that his brother-in
law, J. W. Bird, of Sacramento, who
was instrumental In his arrest and con
viction, was an accomplice in the
crime. This statement, however, is not
seriously entertained by the law offi
cers.
A Bee reporter had a conversation
with Belew ten minutes before his ex
ecution. He was perfectly calm and in-
I quired after the welfare of his wife and
' children. The reporter told him that
; his brother, Arthur Belew, would come
! over from Dixon this afternoon and
' meet the train bearing his body at
j Brighton. Belew seemed to be satis
fled with this arrangement. He men
tioned the fact that his brother.
Tommy Belew, had refused to have
anything to do with him, and had ob
jected to his burial in the family plot
! at Uixon.
Belew made no remarks on the scaf
fold, except to recognize and speak to
Sheriff Rush of Solano County, whom
he questioned relative to the health of
Mrs. Belew and his children. He had
made a will in which he gave what he
owned to his children, naming hia wife
as the trustee of the estate.
Belew died without apparent suffer
ing. The body will be buried in the
Helvetia Cemetery in Sacramento.
A few hours before his death Belew
professed religion to a Methodist min
ister of Auburn, Placer County, who
visited his cell.
The history of Belew's crime is so
familiar that no necessity exists for
setting it forth in detail. The poison
ing of a brother and sister, a deed to
which he confessed, has been related
many times since suspicion first fell on
the man who yesterday yielded to the
law his forfeited life. At first hie sor
row had seemed sincere, and in a meas
ure he was able to avert the tide of
condemnation, oeing assisted in this by
a fair record for morality and by the
absence of apparent excuse for an act
abhorrent and unnatural. Yet he never
came from under the cloud, and when
arrested last February he soon saw
that his case was hopeless. After a
brief season in the Solano County jail
he proclaimed his guilt, and further
than an effort to have the court sen
tence him to life imprisonment did
nothing to escape the penalty.
The arrest of Belew was a notable
triumph for The Call. All newspaper
readers will remember that on that oc
casion no word of the affair appeared
in any other paper while The Call pre
sented a graphic narration, extensive
and complete. The achievement con
stituted one of the greatest "scoops"
ever scored in Western journalism.
There have been few murders more
shocking than that of the Belews,
brother and sister. At the hour of ar
rest the fact had not been known that
clews pointing to the guilty man were
being followed. The first intimation
was when this paper published the
story of the arrest and the evidence
which was destined to take the cruel
assassin to the gallows. It was a sur
prise to everybody, but to other Jour
nals a positive shock. Some of them
sought to assuage grief and wounded
pride by declaring the tale bogus. But
the tale has been vindicated finally by
the fall of the trap.
Belew was arrested at a ranch eight
miles from Dixon. The arresting party
was headed b y Sheriff Rush. With him
were Deputies Robinson, Fitzpatrick
and a representative of The Call. The
night was beautifully clear. The party,
leaving teams several rods from the
gate, approached the house cautiously.
It was thought that Belew might re
sist when aroused, but he calmly sub
mitted. He said repeatedly that th<3
wrong man had been taken and that
he would prove his innocence. He
trembled when the handcuffs were put
on him, and there was a quaver in his
voice. He did not know then that the
chain of evidence had been riveted
about him, and that to hope for escape
was folly. It never entered his mind
that his own fatal admissions had been
recorded, and that next day the world
would look upon him as a wretch lit
only for the scaffold.
The Call had laid the testimony be
fore the officers, and demanded action
only when the last question as to its
weight had been swept away. Two
days later Belew made to District At
torney Devlin, in the presence of wit
nesses, a declaration that himself and
no other had been implicated In the
killing of the brother and sister. He
had previously told the same story to
the newspaper man who had been pres
ent at the time of his arrest.
There was nothing more to be done
than to lot the law take Its course, and
no obstacles were placed in the way of
its doing so. The prisoner acknowl
edged that he deserved to be hanged,
and looked forward to the event with
almost the calmness which had char
acterized the commission of the crime.

ON THE
ANNEXATION IS NOW
BEFORE THE SENATE
Resolution Adopted by the House Is
Referred to the Foreign Re
lations Committee.
WASHINGTON, June 16.â After devot
ing an hour to-day to the discussion of
the bill restoring the annuities to the Sis
seton and Wahpeton bands of Sioux In
dians, the Senate resumed the considera-
tion of the bill to incorporate the Inter
national American Bank. A test vote
clearly indicated that a majority of the
Senate favors the measure. A final vote
on it Is expected to-morrow.
Five minutes after the opening of the
Senate's session to-day, the message clerk
of the House of Representatives deliv
ered to the Senate the Hawaiian annexa
tion resolution passed by the House last
evening. On the suggestion of Davis of
Minnesota the resolution was laid before
the Senate and was then referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations.
After the Senate adjourned Chairman
Davis of the committee said that he would
call it together to-morrow morning to con-
Bider the Hawaiian resolution. Davis
stated that he expected the committee to
dispose of the matter at one sitting, and
that he had no doubt the decision would
be favorable to annexation.
If he is not disappointed in his expecta
tion, he will report the resolution at the
beginning of to-morrow's Bession of thÂ»
Senate, and will ask for immediate consid
eration, resisting any movement that may
be made to secure an adjournment until
Monday,
Davis expressed the opinion that the
outlook for action by the Senate before
the final adjournment is improving. The
present intention is to consider the ques
tion in open legislative session.
Nicaragua Canal Feasible.
WASHINGTON, June 16. â Professor
Haupt of the Nicaragua Canal Commis
sion was before the Senate Committee on
the Nicaragua Canal to-day. He expressed
the Opinion that the canal as proposed was
entirely feasible and placed the cost of
construction at between $90,000,000 and
$95,000,000.

RED CROSS FAIR
WOULD RAISE
A LARGE SUM
Prominent Citizens Indorse The
Call's Plan to Aid the
Local Society.
Business Men Generally Believe a Properly
Managed Entertainment Would Prove a
Great Aid to the Work.
The Call's movement for th^ estab
lishing of a local fair in aid of Red'
Cross work is meeting with great suc
cess. -Representative citizens say It is
the most practical way that a fund
rould be raised for the worthy purposes
encompassed in the plans of the Red
ITross workers.
It is the general opinion that a fair
that would at once entertain the peonle
and give a fund to this worthy cause
would be welcomed by the public at
large. It would prove instructive as
well as popular, while the practical fea
tures would result in the realizing of a
.arp.' pum of money.
The following opinions of well knjwn
citizens, supplemental to the expres
sions of yesterday, will give a fair idea
Df the way the idea strikes the masses
Df thoughtful persons:
J. RICHARD FREUD of the Mer
rhants" Association â The generous
treatment of the soldiers from various
parts of the United States by the Red
ZYoss has won the admiration of peo
ple all over the country. Nowhere has
PRESIDENT WATKINS' IDEAS.
A. A. WATKINS, president of the Board of Tradeâ The idea sug
gested by The Call for the holding of a fair, the proceeds of which are
to be turned over to the ladies of the Red Cross Society, is a noble
one. Every member of the Board of Trade will heartily contribute to
the success of the movement. I can say for the members of the Board
of Trade that they will give all their spare time to make the fair a
success, and in addition they will generously contribute to any fund
raised for the benefit of the soldiers who are fighting under our flag
and for the ones they left behind them.
:here been a more spontaneous out
jurst of hospitality than has been ex
:ended by members of the local society.
\ny practical method of increasing the
imited funds of the society will be wel
:omed by citizens of this State. The
suggestion of a fair for this purpose is
probably the best plan for securing the
necessary funds.
L. R. ELLERTâ I cannot see a single
fault in the plans advocated by The
Sail. I think the matter should be at
:ended to at once. The thing necessary
s for some one to get at it in real
farnest. Newspaper articles alone will
3"t do it, but there must be executive
nanagement and action. Newspapers
iften urge good things^ and then drop
ihem. Some one must take the re
iponslbllity and organize the matter.
Will it be done by the Red Cross, the
people or the paper? It is a good idea,
myhow, and some one should see that
t is not dropped. By all means let the
'und be raised.
PRESIDENT CHARLES L. BAR
RINOTON of the Board of Educationâ
The School Department has aided the
Red Cross in all its efforts to raise
funds. The John Swett School real
zed a neat sum for the Red Cross
workers, and we stand ready to do

Che Call and hope to see them put into

A. CAMINETTI, ex-Congressmanâ We cannot do much for the sol

us have the fair by all means. We can easily secure many thou
sands of dollars in that way, and the Red Cross Society will see
that the meney so received will be placed where it will do the most
good.

the hearty and earnest co-nperation of

A WELL TIMED " KICK."
Army Officers Talk About Pacific
Coast Supplies for the Troops.
The "kick" of the local commercial
bodies against the discrimination of cer
tain officials in the quartermaster's de-
partment of the United States army
against the merchants of this coast seems
to have caused those officials to assume
the defensive; also to give a little "taf
fy" After a meeting of the big commer
cial bodies of this city a few weeks ago
a resolution was sent to the Pacific Coast
reprosentatives at Washington asking
them to call the injustice to the atten
tion of the proper department. The res
olution has brought out this reply, which
has just been received by the Chamber
of Commerce:
WASHINGTON. June 9.
Hon. George C. Perkins: I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the
Gtn in^t., also copy of resolutions adopted at a
joint meeting of the trades associations of San
Francisco wherein it is claimed unjust dis
crimination has been made against the Pacific
Coast.
In reply I beg to call your attention to the
letter from this office of the 26th ultimo upon
the subject, and to state that so far as shoes
are concerned this department wired San
t rancisco to know what could be had for im
mediate delivery for troops about to leave for
Manila. Reply came: "Can secure Immediate
delivery of about 6000 shoes, about standard
weight, but with brass screws." As brass
screwed shoes have proved unsatisfactory for
use of troops a sufficient supply to meet the
existing emergency was forwarded from stock
on hand at Philadelphia and Chicago.
In regard to the matter of furnishing supplies
generally. It should be stated that go far from
the Pacific Coast being discriminated against
It hae been most liberally treated. Many regi
ments raised in the East are being equipped
on the Pacific Coast. The excellent facilities
which the Coast offers for securing large
amounts of supplies are appreciated, and this
department is taking advantage of them to the
fullest extent practicable. Respectfully
M. I. LUDXNOTON,
Quartermaster Oeneral. U. S. A.
This is all right in its way, but it does
not explain why the army's purchasing
agent in the East bought the shoes from
the millionaire Wanamaker at prices
in excess of what the same goods were
offered for in this city. While the Gov
ernment objected to screws in the shoes
h<*re Its agents in the East bought Wan
amaker's shoes, screws and all, and
found no fault that said screws were of
brass. However, the action of the meet
ing mentioned and the correspondence evi
dently set the responsible officials to
thinking a little.

THE SAN FTtANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 17, 1898.
A CONTRAST IN
VESSELS' SPEED
One Made a Record, the
Other Reinsured.
PENRHYN CASTLE ARRIVES
UNDERWRITERS UNEASY AT
HER LONG VOYAGE.
Healy, Tibbitts & Co. Want the Har
bor Commissioners to Help
Them Out on Their Green
Street Contract.
The French bark Marguerite Molinas
has just completed the quickest trip of
the season between San Francisco and
; Great Britain.
She made the run to Falmouth in ninety
one days, beating in at least a dozen ves
sels that Iqft this coast before her. She
made a wonderfully quick run out here,
and at that time Captain Mahe said that
in order to show It was no fluke he would
make an equally good run home. He has
kept his word, and at the same time set
a mark for the rest of the grain fleet to
try at.
The British ship Penrhyn Castle, on
which 10 per cent reinsurance was paid,
arrived from Newcastle, N. S. AY., yes
terday. The vessel had been a long time
off the drydock, and was very foul. Be
sides that, light winds and calms were
encountered during the voyage, and these
two facts account for the long trip. Very
severe weather had prevailed along the
route usually taken by sailing vessels,
however, and this, coupled, with the long
time the Pehrnyn Castle was out, caused
the underwriters to reinsure.
The British ship Crown of India left
Newcastle, N. S. W., forty-three days ago,
and was caught in a gale and dismasted.
She was towed into Sydney, N. S. W.,
and is now being repaired.
The Ben Cruachan left Newcastle for
Antofogasta and the Lismore for San
Francisco one day after the Crown of
India, and it is feared that they were in
the storm that dismasted that vessel, so
10 per cent reinsurance is being paid on
them.
The steamer Professor Morse, which
came around here from New Orleans to go
into the Klondike trade, is to be inspected
by the Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers
i before she goes into commission. The
Morse was formerly known as the British
steamer Eline and later as the British
steamer Suffolk. She was built in 1866,
and is 250 feet long. 28.3 broad, 21.2 deep,
and was built in Port Glasgow, Scotland.
! Her boilers are said to be in poor condi
! tion, and during the run from New Or
! leans to San Francisco the engineer said
: he had to put sixteen patches on them in
; order to hold the steam and get the yes
: sel to her destination. The chances are
that the Morse's boilers will be condemned
and new ones put in before she goes into
the Klondike passenger trade.
The steamer Dirigo, which sails to-mor
row with the river steamer City of Daw
son in tow for St. Michael, will go out
minus one of her passengers. Sam Morton
came here from Globe, AriE., bought a
ticket for that vessel and made all his
arrangements for a two years' stay on the
Yukon. He was taken sick a few days
ago and was removed to St. Luke's Hos
pital, where he died from pneumonia. The
deceased, who was fairly well off in this
world's goods, leaves a widow and son in
Globe. The Dirigo has nearly all her
passenger accommodations taken, and will
1 get away promptly on time to-morrow.
There have been a number of changes
among the ship captains during the last
few days. Captain C. P. Rasmussen has
succeeded Captain Emigh in command of
the schooner Seven Sisters; Capt. li Pt
terson has taken command of tne steam
er Westport; Captain Henry Hansen of
the schooner Reliance and Captain J.
Jorgensen of the schooner Parkersburg.
Captain A. O. Andresen, who went out on
the steamer National City, turned that
vessel over to Captain C. Anderson at
-Portland and has come back here to take
command of the new steamer Bruns
wick.
The now schooner A. M. Baxter, now
building at Eureka, will be 459.61 tons net,
162.7 feet long, 37 feet broad and 12.4 feet
deep. She will be employed in the coast
lumber trade.
At a meeting of the Harbor Commis
sioners yesterday a motion to exclude all
nickel-in-the-slot machines from the fer
ry depot was introduced by President
Colnon. The only exception made was in
favor of the niekel-in-the-Hlot telephone,
which, Mr. Colnon said, was a great pub
lic convenience. The matter was dis
cussed for some time and finally went
over for a week on motion of Commis
sioner Harney, who thinks nickel-in-the
slot weighing machines should also be
permitted, as people going away on a va
cation would naturally want to know
their weight before leaving the city and
also on their return. President Colnon is
not in favor of the weighing machines,
as the last time he tried one of them the
ticket which came forth showed his
weight as 478 pounds. Somebody who was
present at the meeting said that the
weighing machines were just as g od as
the telephones, as the latter always
sprung "line's busy â call again" on a per
son as soon as the nickel was dropped.
The resolution prohibiting any of the
State employes hypothecating their sal
ary warrants was passed and notices of
the Bame will be sent to the Wharfingers
and Collectors and other servants of the
board on the water front. Any man who
is now found borrowing money on the ex
pectation of what may be coming to him
from the State will be considered to have
given sufficient cause for instant dismis
sal.
Healy, Tibbitts & Co. are trying very
hard to get the Harbor Commissioners to
take $13,257 worth of piles off their hands.
Last year the firm contracted with the
board to. tear down, rebuild and widen
Green-street wharf for the sum of $17,
832. They proceeded to get the piles and
lumbf-r here from the Sound, and while
doing so tore down half the wharf, leav
ing it of no earthly use to any one. The
specifications called for progressive pay
ments on the estimates of the chief en
gineer of the board, and for the tearing
down of the half of the wharf the firm
received the sum of $1872 36. Then the
Harbor Commissioners were prevented
from going on with the work by an in
junction suit. While the suit was pend
ing Healy, Tibbitts & Co. got all tlif.ir
piles down and ever since have had them
lying alongside the wharf ready to go on
with the work. They now ask the board
to pay them 75 per cent of the $13,257
which these piles are supposed to have
cost and $1000 additional. They also ask
that as soon as the appeal now pending
in the Supreme Court is settled they be
allowed to do the work of rebuilding
Green-street wharf. In so many words,
what they want is for their contract to
remain in force and for the board to pay
them $12,815, including the $1872 36 already
handed over on a progressive- estimate.
Needless to say the members of the
board do not see the matter in the same
light as Healy, Tibbitts & Co., aivl tho
matter has been turned over to their at
torney for his opinion.
Filing Chattel Mortgages.
A man named Wilgus in Winters gave
W. J. Connelly a chattel mortgage, which
the latter transferred to the Bank of
Winters. Six months later Wilgus went
into insolvency, but two days before he
filed his petition the chattel mortgage was
placed on record. The assignee sued the
bank and the mortgagee for a decree to
set aside the mortgage. The lower court
held that the mortgage under the circum
stances was void because it had not been
recorded as soon as it was made. This
decision was affirmed by the Supreme
Court yesterday, that body holding that
under the new iaw such a mortgage must
be filed at once and that the mortgagee
has no redress if he fails so to do.

PRESENCE
Soldiers to Drill Before
a Swell Crowd.
GEN. MERRITT WILL REVIEW
MINNESOTA'S CRACK REGIMENT
TO BE FEASTED.
A Tremendous Reception to Be Given
to thi Visitors in the Me
chanics' Pavilion To-
Night.
When Major General Wesley Merritt
takes his position in the reviewing stand
in the Mechanics' Pavilion this evening
his eyes will rest on a vast and fashion
able audience. The reception to the Min
nesota troops has taken on a swagger air,
due to the Forum Club lending its aid
in extending further hospitality to the
visiting soldiers, and it is safe to predict
that the multitude that crowds the Pa
vilion will be arrayed in its best. Dis
tinguished citizens and soldiers will be
seated in the reviewing stand, while
around the hall an open-hearted and
patriotic gathering will view the maneu
vers of the crack regiment.
Colonel C. McC. Keeve, aided by his
officers, will carry out an interesting and
strictly military programme. The high
military standard the Slinnesota. boys
have won throughout the Middle West for
drilling and soldierlike appearance will
surely be lived up to this evening, as they
intend to drill as they never did before.
The eyes of a critical master and the
pretty eyes of lovely women will be on
them.
The following programme will be carried
out in its entirety, after which the boys
in blue will be the guests of the ladles of
the Forum Club at an elegant repast:
Entrance of the regiment in heavy marching
order; setting-up exercises, Company 1, Lieu
tenant Byrnes commanding; bayonet exercise.
Company E, Captain Spear; physical exercise
with arms, Company 13. Captain Metz; com
pany drill, Company A, Captain McWade;
guard mounting, detachments from all com
panies; old officer of the day, Captain Bjorn
stad; new officer of the day. Captain Master
man; officer of the guard. Lieutenant C. A.
Clark; supernumerary. Lieutenant Melllnger;
review by General Merritt.
All the employes for the evening have
volunteered their services, and the trus
tees of the Mechanics' Institute will act
as a reception committee and ushers.
The following letter of thanks has been
received from the artists who gave the
successful exhibition at the Press Club In
aid of the Red Cross:
We, the committee, wish to express our
thanks to those who contributed toward the
success of the art students' exhibition and sale,
under the auspices of the Press Club and Red
Cross. To the members of the Press Club,
who so hospitably opened their doors; to the
artists and students whose generosity made
the benefit possible: to the professionals, musi
cians and actors, who furnished the excellent
entertainment; to the merchants who so liber
ally responded to the call for donations; to the
public for its patriotic patronage; to all who
as^ist.^d in the success of the benefit, the pro
ceeds of which will be used as an emergency
fund for our California boys, we extend our

Treasury Department Views With
Disfavor the Temporary Trans
fer of American Vessels.
Assisant Secretary Spaulding of the
Treasury Department at Washington has
issued a circular which will prove to be
more than ordinarily interesting to own
ers of vessels, particularly during the
continuance of the war between the
United States and Spain. The communi
cation begins as follows:
Sir: Replying to your letter of the 2d inst.,
in which you state: "Being the owner of
several American ships we would like to
know if, during the present trouble with Spain,
wo should put our vessels under the English
register, could we, on the return of peace,
have our American register given to the ves
sels again?" I have to say that Section 41C5,
Revised Statutes, as amend yd by section 10
of the act of March 3, 1897, reads: "A vessel
regiFtered pursuant to law which by sale has
become the property of a foreigner, shall be
entitled to a new register upon afterward be
coming American property, unless It has been
enlarged or undergone change in build outside
of the United States."
After quoting the law on the subject
the Secretary proceeds to say:
You are aware that the conditions created
by a state of war are widely different from
ordinary conditions of peace in many commer
cial transactions.
You will observe that the protection of a
neutral flag- Is conditioned on the bona fides
of the sale to n neutral, and your letter seems
to indicate that the sale of your vessel is to
be conditioned on a resale to you at the close
of the war.
According to practice the Department must
decline to make a ruling on the question you
ask until a specific rase requiring its action is
submitted. These considerations, however, and
the propriety of abandoning the flag at this
time and resorting to the protection of an
alien nation, the possibility that the right of
that protection will be denied by Spanish ves
sels or refused by the nation to which you may
apply, and the extent of danger of capture,
real or imaginary, are brought to your atten
tion as matters which may govern your action.
A GAME OF POKER.
"John Doe" Wanted for Getting
Away with a Century.
Nick Dlers of the Alcazar saloon, 114
O'Farrell street, swore to a complaint in
Judge Joachirnson's court yesterday for
the arrest of "John Doe" on a charge of
grand larceny. Detectives Bsan and T. B.
Gibson are searching for "John" and have
a good description of him.
It seems that about three weeks ago a
game of poker Was in progress in Dlers'
saloon and one of the participants got
$100 from Diers. Instead of laying it on
the game he made an excuse to" leave the
table for a mtnute, but did not return.

FROM TENNESSEE
First Regiment From the
South Arrives to Join
the Manila Army.
Significant Orders Last Night to
Hasten the Departure of the
Third Expedition.
WE left Nashville. Term.. seven
days ago, bound for San
Francisco, California, but we
don't seem to have crossed
any State line yet. and I find
it difficult to realize that we are far
from oid Tennessee and on the shores
of the Pacific"
This was the happy tribute of jovial
.old Colonel Smith, First Tennessee Vol
unteers, to the people of every city,
town and hamlet through which his
regiment passed on its way across the
continent. For the strapping Tennes
seeans have been the recipients of one
long ovation continuing through near
ly a score of States.
"It 3 though the people
had showered upon us more than the
usual courtesies," remarked the colonel,
"and 1 know now that there is no
;â¢ any North, "i- South, or East, or
West. The reception accorded my
regiment ;;i every point amply demon-
Btratea t' d lines are forever
obliterate 1."
A third of a century ago this same
gallant old colonel, then a dashing
young captain, wore the Confederate
gray; now the blue envelops his form.
r !}:â â¢ stars and bars he earned a
record for dash and daring that none
car. doubt will be completely sustained
rs and stripes. A native
of Virginia, Colonel Smith removed to
Nashville, Term., soon after finishing
his education and soon established him
self in his professionâ that of architect.
On the breaking out of the Civil War
Colonel Smith returned to his native
State and was given a commission as
captain in the army of Virginia and
BerVed throughout the war under Lee.
After the fall of the Confederacy he
returned to Nashville, which city he
Bince made his home. Colonel
Smith entered the State service three
years ago as colonel of the First Regi
. National Guard of Tennessee,
and when the first call f..r volunteers
was issued his command was one of
:.-t :â¢. respond.
Tho First Regiment went into camp
at Nashville Beven weeks ago with the
;;d Third Regiments, and
wh'-n the latter were assigned to the
Cuban forces tho men of the First felt
that they were being slighted. At last
they were given their choice of going
t.i Cuba or Manila, and every vuice
was for Manila.
The regiment, numbering 1207 officers
and men, arrived in Oakland last night
in ffur. 'ur sections, the first, with the
luarters and four companies, roll
ing into the mole depot at 4:35 o'clock
and the last section shortly before mid
night. The entire command was held
he other side of the bay all night
will be brought over on the 6:30
â¢ this morning.
At Sacramento, Ogden, Denver and
oth< r points the regiment was lavishly
1, but the fame of the Red
s ctety of San Francisco has
spread throughout the East and the
n look forward to the reception
t ':,-y : told awaits them at the
depot this mining with liveliest
anticipation. They will not be disap
pointed, for the ladies have made elab
preparations to entertain the men
fnmi Tennessee. All day yesterday the
members of the society were engaged
in preparing for the occasion. Edibles
of almost every description were pro
vided for, while the tables in the ferry
headquarters were heaped with flowers
until they resembled great banks of
bl. ssoms. Colonel Smith and his men
will look like a section of Golden Gate
Park when those ladies get through
decorating them this morning and start
them up Market street to Camp Mer
ritt.
The Fifty-first lowa band has volun
teered its services to the Red Cross So
ciety for the occasion, and with the fine
band of the First Tennessee there will
be plenty of music. The regiment Is
not fully equipped, there not being near
enough arms and uniforms belonging
to the State to supply all the volun
teers. But they were divided up among
the three regiments, leavUig about a
third of the men in each regiment un
provided for. But when the quarter
master's stores have been drawn upon
it will be found that no finer command
has been assigned to the Army of the
Philippines than the First Tennessee.

A number of severe cases of measles
have developed among the Tennessee

GENERAL MERRITT
PREPARING TO DEPART.
The Military Governor of the Phil
ippines May Go to Manila With
the Third Column.
At headquarters, Department of the
Pacific, yesterday the information was
given out that it was the purpose of the
military authorities to drive ahead as
fast as possible with the third expedi
tion. The five ships already accepted
will be dispatched as soon as they can
be made ready for the trip. There will
be no waiting for other ships in order
to send all the troops remaining in one
grand fleet. There is no disposition up
on the part of the authorities here to
criticize the \> ar Department. No com
plaint is made that the Washington
authorities are slow in providing trans
ports and the department is not urging
General Merritt to greater haste in dis
patching troops to Uaiiila. The work
in hand is going forward to the satis
faction of all parties concerned.
Major General Merritt may decide to
go. to Manila with the third expedition.
He had about made up his mind to go
with the second fleet which sailed day,
before yesterday, but after reflection
concluded to defer his departure from
this city until a larger force was em
barked for the Philippines. The Valen
cia, a steamer that was engaged yester
day, may be used as the flagship for
General Merritt and staff. There is
some talk, however, of the commanding
general going to Manila on the cruiser
Philadelphia.
General Merritt does not know when
the third expedition will san. He is
anxious to get the ships away by the
25th Inst. and will appoint an earlier
time for sailing if the vessels can be
made ready. There will be a fourth
expedition or at least many ships bear
ing troops will sail after the third
squadron departs. A plan may be
formed to send out vessels singly after
the third expedition sails. The way
may be opened for troops to rendezvous
at Honolulu and sail in squadron from
that port to Manila.
Colonel Smith of the First Tennessee,
accompanied by several field and staff
officers, came over from Oakland yes
terday evening and paid his respects
to Major General Merritt.
THE NEXT DETAIL.
lowa, Minnesota, California,
Idaho and Wyoming Ex
pect Orders.
From the trend of observations, and
such advices as the offlrcrs of Camp Mer
ritt discuss among themselves, there is
absolutely no doubt that the third ex
pedition to Manila will leave this port be
tween Monday and Saturday of next
week. The exact day of departure has not
been definitely settled upon, but In all
probability the boats will leave next
Thursday or Frlday :
Major General Otis will select the troops
that are to go, and there is no question of
their approval by Major General Merritt,
who has left the matter entirely In the
hands of General Otis. So far,
from all that can be learned, the Seventh
California, Thirteenth Minnesota, Fifty
iirst lowa Regiments, and the two Idaho
battalions and the Wyoming Battalion
will be the next body of troops sent to the
Philippines.
Yesterday afternoon Major Foote, of the
Wyoming Battalion, received orders to
furnish a detail to guard the Valencia.
Thls vessel had been added to the licet
of transports, and from this It would ap
pear that the Wyoming Battalion will
certainly go along on the next expedition.
The three companies of the Fourteenth
United States Infantry are now equipped,
and it is very likely that Major Robe's
command may also go with the third ex
pedition.
There does not seem to be the slightest
doubt that the expedition will be
commanded by Brigadier General Charles
King. He established his headquarters
yesterday just opposite to those of Major
General Otis.
Brigadier General 11. G. Otis, with hia
entire staff, also established headquar
ters yesterday next to those of General
Marcus P. Miller.
The Eighteenth United States Infantry
has now completely recruited Its ranks up
to the maximum strength. Under an or
der from the War Department Its excess
will be turned over to the Fourteenth
United States Infantry.
Colonel McC. Reeve, Thirteenth Minne
sota, expects 300 recruits on Monday from
St. Paul and Minneapolis. These men
were secured in one day for the regiment
by the recruiting detail sent East.
Lieutenant Kimball with eighteen re
cruits from Salt Lake City for the Utah
Cavalry will arrive to-day.
Colonel Berry, Seventh California., ex
pects his recruits from the southern part
of the State the first of next week. Colonel
Berry was also ordered yesterday .to send
a detail of two commissioned officers and
four sergeants to report to Captain Car
rlngton at the First Regiment Armory to
assume command of the recruits for the
First California. As soon as the required
number of men have be^n secured they
will he taken out to camp and cared for
by Colonel Berry, who will take them with
his command to Manila.
The Twentieth Kansas Regiment will be
paid to-day by Major Whipple. Colonel
Funston, who has been on detached serv
ice, is expected to assume command of
the regiment to-day.
Lieutenant B. D. Kerr, Battalion of En
liÂ±K SAN FRANCISCO tALL, rxtIDAY, JUNE 17, 1898.
ORDERS GIVEN THE THIRD EXPEDITION.
Troops Will To-Day Begin Loading the Shifts of the
Next Fleet for Manila.
Late last night Major General Otis ordered Colonel Reeve, commanding
the Thirteenth Regiment of Minnesota Volunteers, and Colonel Jones, com
manding the two battalions of Idaho Volunteers, to begin this morning
loading their camp equipment on board ship and to rapidly prepare their
commands to embark with the Third Philippine expedition.
He further announced, though not by official order, that the Seventh Cali
fornia and the two battalions of Wyoming would lie of the troops to leave.
Over 300 recruits who will soon arrive to complete the quota of the Min
nesota regiment will be divided among the four or possibly the five boats
that will constitute the fleet.
From significant orders given yesterday by General McArthur to
Colonel Frost of the First South Dakota and Colonel Loper of the Fifty
first lowa, it Is a logical conclusion that these troops also will leave If their
transportation can be arranged.
Major General Meiritt will in all probability accompany the expedition,
though Brigadier Ge^iral King will be nominally its commander.
Major General Merritt has decided that the next sailing shall be by the
25th inst., but Major General Otis is of the opinion that he can accomplish
embarkation by the 21st or 22d.
If, as is intended, the troops of South Dakota and lowa get away with
this sailing. General Merritt will have upon his arrival in Manila Bay from
11,000 to 12,000 troops, a matter of a hundred or so more than half the num
ber he has asked for.
gineers, Willets Point, New York, has
been ordered to report to Captain Lang
fitt for duty with the detachment of en
glneers now at Camp Merritt.
Private Albert Futkus, Company E,
Twentieth Kansas, dieJl at an early hour
yesterday morning at the French Hos
pital, iiis home was at Yates Center,
Kansas.
Private Orville R. Knight, Company F.
same regiment, died at the Field Hospital
yesterday of pneumonia. He was from
Fort Scott. The remains of the two sol
diers will probably be sent East to their
homes.
Private. William Defrain, Company L,
Eighteenth I'nlted* States Infantry, is
very ill at the regimental hospital with
pneumonia.
THE THIRD SQUADRON.
Five Ships Inspected and Ac
cepted â Valencia Added to
the Fleet.
Some work was done on the transports
yesterday. On the Indiana accommotla- :
tiers for about 750 passengers were put in i
at Philadelphia in anticipation of the yes- ;
sel being put in the Klondike trade. Be- j
sides these she can accommodate about
GOO more soldiers and at the same time
carry about 2000 tons of coal, but the j
question has not been settled as to wheth
er she will carry more freight and fewer
soldiers, so nothing will be done until that :
point is settled. The Indiana and the Ohio j
are both well adapted for transports, and
as the Connemaugh and Pennsylvania are
the same type of vessels they should
make welcome additions to the fleet. The
Connemaugh is now on her way to St.
Michael and will be back on the Sound
shortly, while the Pennsylvania will be
due here in a few days. Both could be
easily got ready to go out with the fourth
expedition.
It was thought that the Morgan City
would be one of the first of the present
fleet to get ready, but it has been found
necessary to overhaul her machinery and
boilers so she will not be In order any
sooner than the other vessels. The City
of Para has been on tho drydock and i
overhauled while there, and the work of
putting in berths will begin to-day. The
next fleet will consist of five vesselsâ the
Ohio. Indiana, Morgan City, City of Para
and Valencia. The last-mentioned vessel
was secured by the Government yester
day. The five ships were inspected and
accepted. The Valencia belongs to the
Pacific Steam Whaling Company and can
comfortably carry GOO men. The ship can
steam at the rate of twelve miles an hour.
There Is some talk that Major General
Merritt will sail on the Valencia, as the
ship is nearly new and possesses fine ac
commodations.
The Government is now considering the
advisability of turning the Willamette
and Progreso into troop ships. They are
both In the coal trade, but are fine roomy
vessels, splendid carriers and each can
Jog along week in and week out at the |
rate of ten knots an hour. Both of them i
were turned into passenger steamers !
when the rush to the Klondike was on !
last season, and both made very valuable j
additions to the Dyea and Skaguay fleet.
The Willamette could easily be fitted out
in a week or ten days to" accommodate
1200 men and their equipments, and at the
same time she could take 3000 tons of coal
or provisions. The Progreso could be fit
ted out in the same time to accommodate
800 or 1000 soldiers and a proportionate
quantity of freight. They can be got
ready with less trouble than the ordinary
passenger boats.' as their 'tween decks
from BU-m to stern are clear and the work
of putting in bunks could be done very
expedltiously. The loss? of the two vessels
would be a very severe one to the coal
trade, but would not be felt nearly as
much now as three months hence. With
these two vessels and the Alameda, Con
nemaugh, Pennsylvania and the vessels
that have been secured at Seattle, Uncle
Sam should have no difficulty In transfer
ring all the troops that may be required
in the Philippines.
THE MARIETTA'S RECORD.
A Remarkable Run of Twelve
Thousand Miles.
The following letter from the command
er of the U. S. S. Marietta refers to a
record equal to that achieved by the bat
tleship Oregon:
UNITED STATES STEAMER MARIETTA
KEY WEST, Fla.. June 6. IS9B '
Henry Scott. Union Iron Works. San Fran
cisco, Cal.â My Dear Sir: The achievement of
the Oregon on her recent long run was per
haps no more gratifying than that of this ves
sel, for I am of the Impression that the record
made by the Marietta In her run of 12,000 miles
from San Jose Guatemala has never been
equaled by a man-of-war of her class. I
mean as regards the continuous nature of the
trip and her condition during it and at Its
completion. In the first place our only stops
were from twenty-four to forty-eight hours for
coal. Not once had we to stop for even a slight
repair.
When accompanying the Oregon the Marietta
had no difficulty In maintaining her full con
tract horse-power. Upon our arrival here, had
occasion demanded it, we could have gone out
at once on any duty, after coaling.
The gales we experienced off Sltka, Alaska,
last December, demonstrated her miperior
character as a sea boat, as dlso the superior
quality of workmanship In her construction
as the extreme straining to which she was
subjected did not cause her to leak a drop In
any compartment. This late long trip with Its
results is equally complimentary of her motive
power.
I thought that you would like to hear of her
performance, which I consider as important
and remarkable ns that of the Oregon. We ex
pect to go on blockade duty In a day or two.
Yours respectfully, F. M. SYMONDS,
Commander, U. S. N.
FOURTH U. S. CAVALRY.
Four Troops May Form the
Third Expedition to the
Philippines.
I'nder General Orders No. 2, from the
headquarters of the Department of the
Pacific, recently published In The Call,
the Fourth United States Cavalry Regi
ment was assigned to the regular brigade,
in command of General Miller, of the
Philippine expeditionary forces. Yester
day the following order was Issued from
the headquarters of General Merriam:
Headquarters Department of California.
SAN FRANCISCO, June 15, ISOS.
6. Under authority of the Secretary of War,
Troops C, I, X and L, Fourth United States
Cavalry, are hereby relieved from duty In this
department, and will be reported by the Benlor
officer to Major General Wesley Merritt, United
States Army, now In San Francisco, Cal., for
duty In the Department of the Pacific. By
command of MAJOR GENERAL MERRIAM.
J. B. BENNET, First Lieutenant Seventh In
fantry. Aid, Acting Assistant Adjutant Gen
eral.
Troop C is commanded by Captain
George H. G. Gale; Troop I by Captain
James Lock.tt; 1 roop X by Captain Har
ry C. Benson, and Troop L by Captain
Cunliffe H. .Murray, and all are under the
command of Major Sanford T. Kellogg
\\ hile no definite orders have been offi
cially conveyed to Major Kellogg in re
gard to the time of sailing, it is regarded
as highly probable that the four troops
mentioned will be directed to Join the
next expedition for the Philippines
In all there will be six troops of the
Fourth Cavalry in the Manila expedition
ary forces. Troop G. in command of Lieu
tenant Brown, will arrive here to-day
from Walla Walla and proceed at once
to Camp Merritt. to be followed by Troop
E. under Captain McGraw, which reached
the Presidio a few days ago from the
north. Troops (.'. I, X and L expect to
move to Camp Merritt in a day or two
Troop B. In command of First' Lieuten
ant Neal, and Troop M. under First Lieu
tenant Nolan, will remain at the Presidio
not having been assigns to duty with!
the Philippine expeditionary forces.
At the Presidio last evening the news
of the assignment to Manila created
great enthusiasm among the officers and
enlisted men who had been selected for
service at the front.
First Lieutenant W. O. Haan Third
United States Artillery, adjutant of Camp
Miller at the Presidio, has been appointed
signal officer and ordnance officer of the
heavy artillery of the Independent Di
vision of the Philippine expeditionary
forces.
ARMY HEADQUARTERS.
General Merriam Goes North.
General Merritt Visits the
Big Camp.
Major General Merriam left last evening
for Fort Vancouver, Wash., to attend to
some business affairs of the Department
of the Columbia, which, as well as the
Department of California, is under his
Jurisdiction. The business of the two
departments keeps General Merriam very
busy. During his abs.nce Lieutenant
Bennett, acting assistant adjutant gen
eral of the Department of California, will
be assisted by Major Rathbone, an ex
army officer, who still takes a deep in
terest in all military affairs.
Major General Merritt paid a visit to
Camp Merritt yesterday and held quite a
long conference with Major-General Otis.
Information has been received at army
headquarters that there has been for
warded to this city from the East a large
consignment of submarine cable and tele
graph wire to be shipped on the next
transport fleet to Manila, where it is to
be used in connecting the principal islands
and make a complete system of tele
graphic communication.
Three Hotchkiss revolving cannon, cali
ber 1.45, with carriages complete, and 2IMO
rounds of ammunition, and two 3.6 mor
tars complete, with such ammunition for
the same as may be on hand, have been
ordered to be invoiced from the Presidio
to Captain C. W, Whipnle, chief ordnance
officer of the Philippine expeditionary
forces. One Gatllng gun complete, caliber
rlsi;ind will also be mm
in Whipple. These guns
r use In the Philippines,
l the next transport fleet.
VOLUNTEER ENGINEERS.
One Company to Be Enlisted in
California Under Captain
Rickon.
Tho Government recently authorized
the enrollment of three regiments of
United States Volunteer Engineers. One
regiment, to be comamnded by Colonel
Willard Young, will embrace a company
from California. Word came from Wash
ington yesterday authorizing the enlist
ment of 100 men in this State. Fred J. H.
Rickon, who has been prominently con
nected with the quartermaster's depart
ment for many years, has been appointed
captain of engineer volunteers, and as
signed to the command of a company in
Colonel Young's regiment.
Captain Rickon will recruit his regiment
at once. Application for enrollment may
be made at room 222 Phelan building.
Captain Rickon will want civil, mechani
cal, electrical, topographical and military
engineers, machinists, plumbers, carpen
ters, steam engineers, blacksmiths, tele
graphers, draughtsmen, photographers,
railroad men, riggers and boatmen. Tho
pay of the engineers is slightly in advance
of that allowed in other branches of the
service. The engineer regiments will have
opportunity for active service.
SOLDIERS' SMALL CHANGE.
Uncle Sam Breaks a Money-
Making Record for the
Boys.
The United States Mint at San Fran
cisco is breaking all sorts of records as
it is winding up another fiscal year, and
one of its recent feats Is a result of the
war. Uncle Sam's paymasters, through
whose hands millions of dollars will reach
the boys in blue, want a large amount of
small change. The revival of business
has caused such a constant demand
for subsidiary silver for months that the
United States Treasury has been kept
pretty* well drained of it, though the
mints have been keeping a large stream
of new pieces going out.
When the paymasters came along with
their huge demands it was necessary to
make money right away on the big scale
that attends the hustling for other sup
plies. So a little over two weeks ago Su
perintendent F. A. Ijeach here got orders
from the Director of the Mint to coin at
once $375,000 worth of the smaller silver
coins. The job was begun June 1 and
was completed yesterday. The value is
not so great, but nothing like it was ever
done at the Mint with small silver before.
The pieces struck numbered 1,150.000 and
were halves, quarters and dimes. The
needs of paymasters have also changed the
gold coinage. Since June 1 the $1,653,500 of
gold coir d has been mainly $5 and $10
pieces insieadof double eagles, as is the
rule.
The year just closing will be the great
est one in the history of the Mint. The
coinage to June 30 will he over $47,000,000
in gold besides several millions in silver.
The greatest preceding record was that
of 1577-78, when the coinage was over
$53,000,000, of which $40,000,000 was in gold.
This record is now exceeded with half the
working force then employed and with
but eleven months of operation during
the year. This immense gold coinage is
due to a general increase of supply from
all sources, principally to the importa
tions of gold at this port, mainly of for
eign coin. Since August last $25,000,000,
mostly in British sovereigns from Aus
tralia, have gone into Uncle Sam's melt
ing pots here. It is interesting to note
that during the last three months $1,000,
000 worth of Japanese yen have likewise
been received and melted.
The coinage for May was $6,102,000 and
if it were not for the annual settlement
and clean-up this month the total coinage
for June would be over $7,000,000. The
coinage of all that small silver gave tem
porary Jobs to about twenty deft-fingered
young ladies, but the rush has made no
other additions to the force.
THE POWDER SUPPLY.
The California Company Quad
ruples Its Plant for Uncle
Sam.
It Is appropriate that there should be a
big boom and an enormous pressure in
powder in war times. The pressure is
about every pound the California Powder
Works can stand. A few days ago two
more great hydraulic presses for brown
prismatic powder were got in operation
at the plant of the company in the Santa
Cruz Mountains, and by July 1 two more
will be ready. The capacity of the works
will then be four times what it was when
the war began. Even at that officers of
the company say that contracts now in
hand will require months to fill. The
company is now turning out 25,000 pounds
a day, of which about 500") pounds is
smokeless, but "hurry-up" orders from
Washington are coming right along. Over
at Pinole, across the bay, the company
has an acre of niter pots in constant
operation and the scale of all its opera
tions is increasing daily.
WASHINGTON INFANTRY.
One Battalion Has Been Or-
dered to the Presidio and the
Other to Angel Island.
The First Battalion of the First Regi
ment of Washington Volunteer Infantry,
under Major Weisenberger, has been or
dered to the Presidio, and the Second
Battalion, under Lieutenant-Colonel Fife
and Major Carr, will move to Angel
Island. This movement will leave Fon
tana barracks vacant. The old ware
house has proved very comfortable quar
ters and it is with regret that the men
leave the place. It was thought that
when they moved it would be to go on
board ship for the Philippines.
Soldiers on the Way.
William H. Snedaker of the Denver and
Rio Grande Railway received advices yes
terday that 108 lowa recruits will leave
Salt Lake City for San Francisco at 12 20
this afternoon by a train on that line
wl>:ch connects with tiie Oenual Pacilic
at Ogden. arriving in this city at S:ls
p. m. on Saturday. A second train, wh'ch
will leave Salt Lake at 12:20 p. m. on Sat
urday, has on board 75 more lowa re
cruits for this city. It will connect at Og
den with the train arriving In this city at
5:45 p. m. Sunday. The Astor Battery left
Pueblo, Colo., at 10 p. m. yesterday.
War Incidents.
Court Bohemia of the Ancient Order of
Foresters is a patriotic one. Out of a
membership of sixty ten have joined the
regular army and six have entered the
volunteer service. Financial Secretary
Mahar was the last man accepted to fill
the quota of the Minnesota Volunteers.
The first shot fired from the United
States at the Buena Ventura was by
John Malia, a member of Washington
Council, Young Men's Institute, of Wash
ington, D. C.
There is to be a grand concert and en
tertainment tendered to all soldiers and
their friends in the Catholic Truth So
ciety tent at Camp Merritt on Tuesday
next, at 8:30 p. m. by the League
of the Cross Cadets Band. They will be
assisted by Company A, League of the
Cross Cadets, Glee Club, Messrs. Flores
and Dougherty, banjoists, the Misses J.
and M. Mulcare, Miss M. Cavanagh and
Q. Montgomery, Messrs. J. H. O'Brien, G.
F. Kcane, G. F. Crelghton and others.
All of the soldier boys who left on Wed
nesday were supplied with comfort bags,
and, needless to say, they were gratefully
received.
Throe of the large furniture dealers of
the city have kindly loaned a large num
ber of chairs for the headquarters of the
Christian Endeavor Society at the Camp.
The socials which are given each even
ing at the headquarters of the Christian
Endeavor Society continue to be a great
success. The large rooms are crowded
with the boys in blue and hundreds are
unable to gain admittance.
The First South DakotaS will be paid
off to-day.
The force of the Field Hospital now
consists of 121 officers and men. the larg
est hospital corps ever organized in the
United States army.
First Lieutenant Colo, Company C, and
Second Lieutenant Halpin, Company K.
Sovonth California, with four non-com
missioned nflieers, were detailed yester
day to examine and drill the recruits now
being signed by Captain Carrington. Of
123 men who offered themselves yesterday
only 87 passed the usual examination.
The Third United States Artillery had
its ilrst regular drill in extended line of
battle work yesterday at the Presidio,
and the men entered into it with the
greatest enthusiasm. One of the features
is the yoll that is given in making a
charge on the enemy, whom it is intended
to terrify. It was introduced in the Civil
War by the Confederates and was known
as the rebel yell. It has since been adopt
ed by the regular army and its effect is
said to be wonderful.
The funeral of Private John A. Stevens
of Troop L of the Fourth Cavalry yester
day afternoon at the National Cemetery
was attended by the members of his regi
ment in a body.
It was reported that the men of the
Tenth Pennsylvania Regiment did not
have nny dinner the first night they were
on board the Zealandia. If such is the
case the fault lies with the regimental
commissary. The Roc] Cross Society fur
nished every officer and man with h--Â»
coffee and nn ample lunch at noon that
day and would have seen to it that din
ner was sent on board the ship after she
went into the stream had they known that
there was any trouble in getting at the
commissary stores on board.
GRADUATES BANQUETED.
The Alumni Association of the depart
mpnt of pharmacy. University of Cali
fornia, last night tendered a banquet to
the class newly graduated from the Col
lege of Pharmacy at the college building
on Fulton street.
The event was a most happy one in
every way. The old boys and young boys
met, clasped hands, feasted and sang to
gether in a most boylike manner.
The annual meeting of the alumni was
hold just before the banquet, at which
the following oftlcers were elected: Miss
J. Barbat, president; Ike Tobriner, vice
president: L. W. Bahney, second vice
president; E. P. Gates, secretary; J. S.
Warren, treasurer; Harry Schwartz, reg

A stenographer for a large law firm in Boston had a rather^
common experience : "My work," she said, "is very nervous and ex-
acting, and^ I used to leave the office utterly exhausted. At night I
would often have the most horrible dreams, and sometimes wake up in
a cold sweat. Once I found myself sitting bolt upright in bed clutch-
ing the bed clothes frantically with both hands. I became so dis-
heartened that I finally told my employer I must give up my position,
but he laughed, and said he wanted me to stay, and then suggested
that I try his remedy for such troubles. He gave me half a dozen
Ripans Tabules and told me to take one after dinner and another
before going to bed. I did so, and rested better that very night
Now, whenever I feel nervous, I take just one Tabule before retiring
and I sleep right through till morning, and get up thoroughly rested
and ready for business. For a sleep-producer and a auieter of thÂ«
nerves, these Tabules are simply wond^cjful,^

WhjOLE SOULED LOYALTY.
WJ HOLE souled loyalty is the phrase used by
the Boston Journal to express its judgment of
the action of the Chamber of Commerce of
this city in refusing to protest against the dispatch of
the Monterey and Monadnock to Manila. Nor does
i: stand alone in this opinion. Nothing done in San
Francisco of recent years has been so warmly ap
plauded throughout the country as the spirited reply
sent by our merchants to Senator Perkins on that oc
casion.
The Philadelphia Record, quoting the words of the
Chamber of Commerce, "San Francisco will hold
nothing back from the administration even to her
own jeopardy," says: '"There was more than patriot
ism in this rejoinder; there was the proud, self-reliant
California spiritâ a spirit closely akin to that pos
sessed by Dewey himself. Whatever may be said
of the Senator's suggestion, there can be nothing but
admiration lor the statesmanship of his constituency/
The Boston Journal devotes to the subject a long,
elaborate and highly laudatory editorial. It declares
"The people of San Francisco are nothing if not pa
triotic," and after giving a statement o: the occasion
which called forth the reply of the Chamber of Com
merce and a summary of the document itself, adds:
"This is whole souled loyalty which will delight Ad
miral Dewey and his men and bring cheer to the
hard worked Government at Washington."
It is gratifying to receive these encomiums from in
fluential papers in the East and to be conscious they
are not mere llatteries. As was pointed out by The
Call at the time, the action of the Chamber of Com
merce in refusing to put the interests of San Fran
cisco above those of the nation as a whole was a man
ifestation of genuine patriotism and expressed the
prevailing sentiment of the people of California. We
are glad to note that the loyalty of the city has been
recognized and acknowledged in the East, and re
turn thanks for the commendation that has been so
generoii-ly j. T iven.
THE LARGER VIEW.
SAYS the Indianapolis News: "The wine grow
ers of California are wroth at the reciprocity
treaty with France, which reduces the import
duties on French wines. They want reciprocity un
Somebody else's product. That is generally the way.
But if we arc going to expand, if we are contemplat
ing a world-wide commerce, whether or not we con
template a world-wide empire, we must have a view
large enough to see that there are other vineyards in
the world as weH as ours."
Exactly so. The people of California have a view
large enough to see that there are in this country, if
not other vineyards, at least other interests, than
ours, and would like to know why they should not
bear a due share of the burdens of reciprocity.
The treaty with France obtains from that country the
admission of United States meat products and lard
to French markets at lower duties than are imposed
on the products of other nations. It pays for this
iion by admitting French wines, brandies, ver
mouth and wine lees to American markets at a re
duced rate of duties. Indiana produces meat and
lard and gets the benefit of the treaty, but she pro
duces neither wine nor brandy, and therefore pays
nothing for the benefit. California, on the other
hand, while producing little or no meat or lard for
export, produces nearly all the table wine of the
United States. Her people, therefore, get little ben
efit from the treaty, but pay the whole cost of it.
The clause of the Dingley tariff which, authoriz
ing the President to arrange reciprocity treaties with
foreign nations, confines him to concessions on wine
lees, brandies, wines, vermouth and works of art, is
radically unfair. The whole burden of reciprocity
with countries like France, Germany, Italy and Por
tugal is, under this clause, thrown almost exclusively
upon California. Those countries are large exporters
of wine, and if their product of this kind is admitted
free of duty the pressure of competition will be heavy
upon the wine men of the United States. Now, Cal
ifornia is the only State which has an extensive wine
industry and therefore is the only one that suffers.
The people of California desire a world-wide com
merce, and are willing to pay their due share of the
cost of it. They nre most cordially willing to pro
mote the welfare of other sections of the Union.
California produces no iron. Nevertheless, her peo
ple loyally support the protective duty on iron. Ob
jection is made only when protection to v Californian
industry is stricken down in order that interests in
other sections of the ; Union may be benefited. The
Indianapolis News should have a view large enough
to see that the vineyards of California deserve as
much from the Government as the stockyards of In
diana.
The Colorado soldier who whacked a policeman
over the head with his gun seems to have done the
correct thing. However, the head must have been
unusually tough or the gun unusually frail, for it was
the gun which broke.
PARTIES AND THE WAR.
IT is said that the Bryan Democracy, in view of
the apparent e'flacement of other issues, propose
to fight the fall campaign on a platform of oppo
sition to holding as colonies the islands we take from
Spain by conquest.
This is probably true, because it is entirely char
acteristic of the men who think they are leading that
party and who think they think out its policies. Such
a grave change in the direction of our national
growth and such a portentous change in our policy
should be considered by the people without refer
ence to party passion or position. But granting
that it is to be a party question, by what rule of con
sistency can the Bryan party antagonize it?
From the beginning of Mr. Cleveland's second ad
ministration these men in the House and Senate were
the jingoes, grabbers and annexers. Led by Mor
gan, they wanted Hawaii, and confessed to a sweet
tooth for Cuba. They prolonged their .ululations
into the present administration and nagged it with
out ceasing in the same direction. Champ Clark of
Missouri recently announced in that loud voice which
is his chief claim to oratory, "this is a Democratic
war," and all the strut and swagger and posing have
been on that side.
Now there are two policies in issue as the conclu
sion of this war. One is to compel a peace; take, per
manently, as England holds Hongkong and Gibral
tar, coaling stations in the Philippines. Ladrones,
Carolines, Canaries and Porto Rico, leave the people
of the several islands to settle their own government,
pay up the score and come home. We have already
Pearl River in Hawaii and Pango-Pango in Samoa
for coaling stations, and with these we are as well
equipped in that respect as England.
Holding these coaling stations will not injure our
position as the enforcer of good order and good gov
ernment in this hemisphere, and the naval protector
of our trade in all countries, and to abstain from a
colonial scheme will make us stronger than all the
world besides, with that strength which comes of self
control and unselfishness.
Evil doers among the nations will stand in awe of
a people willing, at their own expense, to right the
wrongs of the weak.
The other policy is, to hold what we take. It
will bear discussion. If it is not adopted and if we
come out with a line of coaling stations and a war
debt of nearly a billion the same partisan demagogues
who are now opposing the colonial scheme will, in
ir,oo, be denouncing McKinley's administration for
not adopting it. It is therefore just as well to settle
what is to be done without reference to the wishes
of men who are opportunists out of power and inca
pable of governing when in power.
POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
AMONG the important acts of legislation ex
pected of Congress at this session, which have
been postponed on account of tlie war, is that
of establishing postal savings banks. At the begin
ning of the session every aspect of the situation was
promising to the measure. The Postmaster General
recommended it, eminent leaders in each house of
Congress supported it, the press and the people fa-
\ored it, a bill providing for the establishment of the
banks was promptly introduced, and the outlook for
a speedy enactment of the measure was good.
The war distracted the attention of the country from
the measure and the energies of Congress were neces
sarily directed to other affairs of greater urgency.
As a result the postal bill went over indefinitely, and
there is now little or no chance that it will be taken
up at this session, even if it should T>e dealt with at
ajl by this Congress. One result of the delay has
been to encourage opposition to the measure, and
while the friends of the bill have been more or less
silent in regard to it for some time past, the oppo
nents have been busy in putting their objections be
fore the public.
One of the most notable arguments against the
measure was recently made at the meeting of the
Saving Banks' Association of the State of New York
by Myron T. Herrick, president of the Society for
Savings, of Cleveland, Ohio. The New York Com
mercial and Financial World in reporting and com
mending his address says he put the essence of the
problem in a nutshell in the statement:
"This scheme is not consistent with the spirit of
our form of government. With nations abroad, the
tendency and policy is to make the people subservient
to the government. Our theory looks to making
the government subservient to the people. The spirit
of individual independence runs through our whole
governmental system, and should be fostered rather
than discouraged."
If the Commercial and Financial World is right in
asserting this to be the main objection to the measure
the opposition might as well abandon the field of
argument It does not appear that the establishment
of postal savings banks would render the people any
more subservient to the Government than they are
now. As a matter of fact, it would render the Gov
ernment more serviceable to the people by enlarging
the scope of its work for the general good. The
spirit of individual independence is nor going to be
weakened by a provision to encourage thrift and
saving. Such assertions are not likely to have weight
with any one who is not biased by prejudice or trade
interests against the proposed banks.
The attack made on the postal banlc scheme before
such an association as that addressed by Mr. Herrick
is a matter of interest, however, without respect to
the quality of the argument used. It shows there
will be a strong opposition to the measure. The
friends of the bill, therefore, must be on guard and
ready to make a united fight when the time comes for
Congress to deal with the subject.
Spain is alarmed at the prospects of a visit from
an American fleet. There was a time when a few
people in this country felt the same way at the
thought that a Spanish fleet might call on our coast.
This was, however, before the fact had developed
that the Spanish fleet^ is designed principally for
finding a bottle and sailing into trie neck of the
same.
The more John Sherman talks the firmer grows the
impression that among his distinguished services to
his country that of retiring from office was not the
least.
Blanco's soldiers are said to be deserting to the
enemy. In a measure this may show their wisdom,
bm it does not create the impression that they are
good soldiers.
Naturally, the hanging of Frank Belew recalls the
circumstance that on the occasion or his arrest The
Call was the only paper in the world to give the
news.
The soldiers who have thus far heen left behind
have no occasion to fret. They will go to Manila
soon enough to be homesick for San Francisco.
Professor Norton goes too far when he says Amer
icans have no honor. We object to this thing of
being called Nortons.
THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 17, 1898.
I" 11 HE political silly season is always ushered in
hereabouts with announcements that the va
rious leaders, bosses and manipulators are "out
of politics." We have been treated this year to the
usual evidences that, from the standpoint of these
worthies, the voters of all political parties are more or
less of an ass. For instance, Boss Rainey positively
declares that he has made his last appearance on any
stage and will, in the coming campaign, take no in
terest whatever in politics. Boss Buckley has re
tired to his Livermore estate with the solemn assev
eration that he is tired of the fray and will have noth
ing more to do with the "boys." Since he launched
his extraordinary Committee of One Hundred,
"Whispering" Boss McNab is "out of politics."
Gould and Alford never were in; they were simply
"trustees" of the people.
On the Republican side Colonel Dan Burns is out
for good. According to his announcement a four
horse-dray team could not drag him back into the
filthy pool, and in the coming gubernatorial cam
paign he will take only the interest of an "American
citizen." Ever since Mrs. Mahoney recovered judg
ment against Martin Kelly that apostie of pure pol
itics, a free ballot and a fair count has been "out," and
it is said nothing short of a reversal of the decree
of Justice of the Peace Cook by the Superior Court
will revive his spirits sufficiently to induce him to
again get "in." Even M. M. Estee, the time-honored
candidate of the Republicans for Governor, has re
tired, notwithstanding thousands of his fellow citi
zens are clamoring to have him again enter the race
for the highest office within the "gift of the people."
Yet all these fellows are working like beavers, not
only "in" politics, but everywhere else where a pull
may be exercised or a delegate to something may
be captured. They are every one burning midnight
oil over the new charter and asking lawyers for opin
ions as to the legal effect of this or that provision.
The Southern Pacific is also "out of politics," with
the reservation that it will get "in" the moment its
interests are threatened, which means that it could
not be driven "out" by a battalion of infantry. One
hears of all these bosses at every turn â even Estee's
gubernatorial boom is immensely in evidence, as it
always is. The overpowering question thus pro
pounds itself, that if retirement from politics consists
in spending all one's time at putting up jobs for car
rying conventions and trading nominations, what
would happen if the bosses were actually "in" poli
tics?
We trust the people will not be fooled by any such
representations. The announcements to which we
have referred are intended for the gudgeons. No
man who has ever engaged in the excitement of ma
nipulating the offices ever thoroughly recovers. Mr.
Blame once declared that he had been discharged
cured from politics. At the very next election he
dictated the Republican nomination for President and
afterward became the candidate's Secretary of State.
A politician "out of politics" very much resembles a
good Indianâ dead. Gladstone, blind, speechless
and stripped of his powers of digestion in retirement,
still continued to influence his party in Parliament.
Rismarck is "out of politics," and yet every now and
then he opens his mouth and all Germany quakes.
Mr. Huntington "out of politics" is "in" with both
hands and feet.
The people should not be misled. Everybody is
in politics, the ex-bosses up to their ears. After
election a few of them are compelled to get "out"
temporarily, but they are "in" again at the very first
opportunity. Getting "out of politics" is a merely
huge joke.
Tacoma has just had a local tragedy which, while
by no means pleasing, possessed a finish little less
than satisfactory. It seems that a man, stirred by
the demons rum and jealousy, shot another man and
the woman in the case. The first victim died with
out entering protest, but the woman was of different
stuff, and after receiving fatal wounds, she seized the
pistol of the assailant and killed him. Then she died,
thus making a clean-up and leaving no troublesome
details for the courts to bother with.
There seems no particular reason why Princeton
should have bestowed upon Dewey the title of LL.D.
Not but the admiral deserves every honor that can
be extended, but a sailor man and a tighter does not
become a repository of legal knowledge by the gift
of a dignified trio of letters. It would be as appro
priate to term "commodore" an attorney who never
smelled salt water.
That the commander of the hospital ship has been
ordered to run at sight of a Spanish warship shows
the estimate put by diplomacy on the nonor of that
nation. The opportunity to sink a load of wounded
would be a boon only less cheering than a whack at
a land hospital guarded by women.
There ought to be some way of proceeding against
the man who wrote to the Coroner of definite sui
cidal intent, but failed to abide by the terms of his
letter. As a joke, the episode had nothing to com
mend it, but as a case of false pretense it stands out
with clearness.
It can hardly be thought that Armour has "gone to
Leiter's relief," even though the telegraph does so
affirm. As a speculator, Armour is not in' the habit
of constituting himself a relief party for the purpose
of promoting the comfort of other speculators.
According to one Cabinet officer, peace will have
to be "forced down the throat of Spain." Already
there is such a grip on the Spanish throat that great
force would be necessary in promoting the process of
swallowing even so desirable a morsel.
For the gratification of calling another lawyer a
liar, an attorney has just paid $io to the court. From
the air with which he handed over the money it is
believed he did not regard the price as high.
Sausalito Trustees, in their wisdom, have decided
that two poolrooms are enough for the town. Other
people, who have not the distinction to be Trustees,
are confident that the two are two too many.
Several bunko men have promised to leave the city,
but the promise is not backed with bonds. How
ever, if it happen to be kept, neighboring cities may
send us a vote of thanks.
That the .Temerario cannot put to sea is a fortu
nate circumstance for Spain. If all her boats had
been in the same condition she would now have had
clear title to them.
United States troops still refuse to follow the
methods of the chivalrous Castilian. Not in a single
instance has the body of a Spanish soldier been mu
tilated.
Americans are accumulating enough prisoners to
be able to trade a company or two for the eight of
the Hobson party.
The Merrimac incident is said to be troubling Spain.
Possibly in so doing it is fulfilling its purpose

STRIKING ECCENTRICITIES.
Among the extraordinary eccentricities
of men occupying a conspicuous place in
the eye of the public there Is none that is
more strange than the inability cf some
of them to sleep in the house in which
they are living.
Thus Cecil Rhodes, when in South Af
rica, is In the, habit of having either a
tent, a hut, or a little shanty of some
kind put up in the grounds of his fine
houses, to which he retires to sleep at
night, being unable to secure a moment's
sound sleep in the house Itself.
It is the same with Lord Rosebery, who
is a martyr to insomnia. When at Dal
meny, his splendid country seat in Scot
land, where he is shortly to receive a visit
from the Queen, he retires each night, af
ter having taken leave of his guests, to
Barn Bougie Castle, to sleep, and when in
London at his house in Berkeley Square,
he drives down, to Epsom in order to sleep
at the Durdans, his place on the world
famed Downs, much in the same way as
any one of us would walk upstairs to bed.

QUESTIONS SETTLED BY THE
WAR.
The war is but a month old, yet, as the
Courier-Journal has before pointed out,
it has already disproved some popular
fallacies with reference to the modern
navy.
One of these is that the cumbersome
warship is more dangerous to itself than
to the enemy; that it Is easily sunk, and
that it has most to fear from its own flre.
Instead of the confirmation of these :
theories, all the experience we have yet i
nad brings confirmation of the theories j
of the scientists who constructed the I
navy. The ships so far have done just !
what they were designed to do and more I
than they were designed to do. The â¢
gigantic Oregon has made a voyage of
over 13,000 miles as cleanly as an ocean
liner; the lowa, the mightiest lighting I
machine in our navy, is here to-day and !
there to-morrow, with never an accident. i
aim fires her big guns with none of the
disastrous effects to herself that had been
predicted. The squadron of Dewev has
annihilated- the Spanish fleet in the Pa
cific with hardly a scratch to itself and
our gunners have demonstrated time and
again that big guns will do just what
they were intended to do when manned I

THE SHADOW BEFORE.
Europe is within measurable distance
of a calamity which, if it arrive, will try
the stability of every government on the
Continent. If on Bastile day, now three
weeks off, the rivers of France are. out of
their banks, some millions of human be
ings will be destined within a twelve
month to confront starvation. Already
some hundreds of thousands in Italy
other hundreds of thousands in Spain and
yet others in Russia know the pangs of
hunger, the fruits of a single crop failure
Misery has pressed hard in Bohemia and
Roumania. Only in France, Germany the
Baltic, Poland and Hungary has there
been during the past year no downright
deficiency in the supply of food needed to
sustain human life in sound condition
But should the harvest of IS9S fail there
is not a department, there is scarcely a
parish from Cape Finisterre to the Neva
from the British Channel to the Golden
Horn, but must know what it is to
go hungry. This is a strain which gov
ernments have never yet survived, and
which, therefore, we are Justified in be
lieving that they will never survive.-New

With the departure of the monitors as
signed to service in the Philippines the
Pacific Coast will be stripped of its last
\estige of naval protection. But the peo

awake nights with needless alarms nor
asking for flying squadrons to guard
them against phantom fleets from Cadiz.
The president of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, in answer to a
suggestion from Senator Perkins that the
people of California should "protest," ex
presses the popular sentiment as follows:
"We protested on the 12th of April. In
the meantime Dewey has acquired for
California a new outlet for our energies,
employment for our shipping, business
for our meVchants, and has opened a
colonizatlng future far beyond our most
ardent expectations. We of San Fran
cisco will hold nothing back which may
be of service to the administration, even
to our jeopardy."
This cheerful view of the situation in
dicates that the true American sentiment
is more accurately represented by the un
terrlfled people of San Francisco than by
certain alarmists along the New Eng

USEFUL WORK OF SCHOOLBOYS
Professor Doyle Exhibits the Clever Handiwork
of His Pupils.
On the lower Moor of Lincoln School Is an exhibition of modeling that has
received unnUr.ted praise from hundreds of visitors to the well-known place of
learning. The work is that of pupils in the different grades and comprises every
kind of "Sloyd" work. Professor Doyle, who is in charge of the department, was
busy yesterday showing the useful articles made by the lads under his charge.
There were spool-holders, salt-boxes, hairpin holders, match boxes and. In fact,
everything that could be turned out with knife and plane. Around the room
were twenty substantial benches on which the youths work. Planes, saws,
gauges, squares and knives rested In their proper places and everything bore the
appearance of neatness and discipline.
Three hundred scholars had little creations on exhibition and proud mothers
marched around hunting for articles turned out by their boys. It was surprising
to see what progress they have made during the past six months under their
teacher's Instruction and If the work exhibited yesterday is a criterion of what
they can do at the end of their three years' course many will certainly be abie
to earn a livelihood by their handcraft. But one hour a week Is given the boys
to indulge in their study owing to the large number of classes, and their anxiety
to finish their work is so ,?reat that they eagerly wait for their turn to come
round again. It is Professor Doyle's plan to place models before his pupils and
they follow them with trueness and accuracy. The seventh and eighth grade
pupils make their own drawings and then model from them. Mr. Hamilton, the
principal of the institution, is very much gratified with the work of the boys and
intends allowing them more time to follow their interesting work.
Little effort is needed on the part of the teacher to get the boys to follow his
guidance. The only trouble he finds Is their eagerness to progress. "Do not
hurryâ fine work takes time and patience, and haste makes waste" Is a motto
constantly before the pupil.
The prettiest pieces of workmanship done by the boys are two cabinets, which
for style and finish would be a credit to much older workers. Wren Westcoate
and Thomas Bastlun made these and have received many encomiums from their
teacher. James Dillon has also turned out some splendid things, and takes rank
with the former two as a leader In the class.

tenances thereunto belonging." The case
in which this question arose grew out of
a transaction In which W. C. Owen mort
gaged land to the Modesto Bank.- A firm
in Modesto furnished the seed for the
crop, hut before it was ready to harvest
the bank foreclosed on the mortgage and
the lower court placed a receiver in
charge of the crop. Later the court gave
a decree in favor of the bank and ordered
the sale of the grain to satisfy any de-
Qciency. The Supreme Court reversed this
decision, holding that the bank's mort
gage did not cover the crop but was a lien
on the land only.

Result of a Grasp for
Judicial Power.
ASSESSMENTS ARE INVALID.
STREET COMMISSIONS APPOINT
ED UNDER ILLEGAL ORDERS.
Et May Mean the Loss of All the
Present Extension Boards and
of Much Time and
Money.
In passing upon the legal status of the
assessment for the extension of Potrero
avenue, City and County Attorney Cres
well has found something which may ren
der invalid all assessments and extensions |
proceeding under a certain form of order ]
which the Supervisors were in the habit ;
of passing whenever It was necessary to j
! extend a street.
The opinion was rendered In pursuance j
of a petition to the Board of Supervisors ,
â  from the Mission league of Improvement
Clubs asking that the remainder of the
assessment due be collected as it made a
cloud on the titles of all those persons de
linquent. The assessment had been levied
by a commission holding office by virtue j
of an order of the Supervisors. After
$25,000 had been paid the collection of fur- ,
ther assessments was stopped by injunc
tion and the assessments in the cases of
forty or fifty property owners were an
nulled. It Is the remaining sums due on j
the assessments of those not included In â 
the Judgment that it was asked would be j
rectified. ,
In his opinion, Mr. Creswell declares j
that the whole proceeding was Illegal, as 1
the power of the commission was derived
from an order which had been expressly
declared unconstitutional. In the order
which the Supreme Court declared was !
unconstitutional the following words ap
pear: The propt-rty "is hereby condemned, I
appropriated, acquired, set apart and
taken for public use." In using this lan
1 tage, the court said, the Supervisors
took to themselves judicial functions,
overstepping the- limit of their legislative
functions, and therefore the order was
void. It was an order for the extension of
Market Street In the order for the exten
sion of Potrero avenue, exactly the same
language is used, so Mr. Creswell saw
nothing to (In but advise the board that
the assessment could not be collected nor
could it form a lien on any of the prop
erty as it was void from the start and
never bad been legal.
It appears that the order in question
was formulated on the same lines as all
the others, evidently a copy of some form
with the descriptions of the property filled
in to suit the case, and so there are many j
other street extension assessments which J
will have to follow the track of that of j
Market street and Potrero avenue. It is I
even possible that those who have paid
their assessments, wholly or in part, can
have the- amount they paid in returned to
them, and there are a number of street
txu-nsions now under way which may
be seriously hampered by the little joker I
that plays so important a place in the or
di-rs givinp power to the commissions.
The Supervisors have* no Judicial pow
ers: they have only legislative powers, and
they cannot "condemn," "set apart" nor
"acquire" by the mere passing of an or
der stating that they do so.
The amount Involved in the Potrero av
enue assessment la $241,202 67, and there is
over a million and a half involved in
other assessments which may be affecteu
by the defective paragraph.

for the days; those underneath It, if any, the
amount of riiinfall or of melted snow In Inches
ond hundretlths during the last twelve hours,
rs, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature, The word "high" means high
trie pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
.ly weather and rains. "Lows" usually
ppear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure, is high In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the iÃObars extend north

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET. .
NEW YORK, June There was a small
bear ' panic to-day, which caused an upward
niFh of prices in the first hour such as has not
been seen on the Stock Exchange for days.
Blocks of 1000 shares and upward of leading
stocks were snapped up with avidity. The
prominent specialties and the Grangers had the
most conspicuous advances, but the strength
was quite well distributed In the list and gains
In the railroads were nearly uniform. After
the opening rush the market fell into dullness
and drifted rather aimlessly below the high
point, but without falling to the opening level.
The later transactions were limited In volume
and the clcslne was almost Inanimate, but
firm at the top. The absence of any large gen
eral demand after the rush tO cover FhnrtS,
considered in â¢ â (â¢tii>n with yesterday's down
wi â¢â ! movement. indicated that the market is
near the point of stability. Yesterday's de
cline railed to dislodge any large offerings, in
dicating that the supply Is flrmiy and strongly
1 Â» l.l- Hut there was equally an absence ot any
effort on the part of the inside interests to
advan â <- prices to-day, except in special cases.
The demand from the shorts was very pro
nounced In Tobacco, Sugar, People's Gas and
the Grangers.
Hates for time money were quotably higher,
ranging from 2"i?2% per cent for sixty days and
8% per cent for six to eight months. New
York exchange at Chicago also fell to 10c dis
count.
Business was not large in the bond market,
but the tendency of prices was upward. Total

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. June 16â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
market here was quiet and firm to-day. Ameri
cans were good on New York prices, but closed
under the. best. Business was restricted by the
Ascot races. Brazils were good on the fund
ing scheme. The banks of Bombay and Hen
gal have each reduced their discount rates. It
is believed that the money market is being pre
pared for an Issue soon or a new rupee loan.
The Paris Bourse was steady, and the Berlin
market quiet. A rise in money rates in Her
lln restricts business. The tightness is partly
due to the gradual issue of the new Russian
loans.
The local discount market was firm at l l^.
The supply of American bills .offered "to ar
rive" ia Increasing. Rates on bills to arrive
during July are quoted at 1% per cent.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 16.â At the start advanced
quotations from Liverpool and numerous crop
damage reports, together with the belief that
Armour was likely to prove a stronger card
for the bulls than Letter, started wheat higher.
The bear element was for a time considerably j
demoralised and the buying rush was quite i
pronounced. September, which closed yester
day at 72% c, found plenty of buyers at 73% c,
an.l some few were even paid 73% c. July sold
up to S2%c. or 2%c above where it left off last
night. However, both Chicago and Liverpool
came so under the Influence of the immense
prospective supplies of wheat that Liverpool
commenced to topple and the bull contingent
here took fright and the buying came to a
sudden halt. Then there was a rush on the
part of the early buyers to unload, some to
secure profits and some to g"t rid of losses,
and the decline was more rapid than the ad
vance had been. At the close July waa %@%c
lower and September l%'ftl%c down.
There was a strong opening in corn on un
favorable weather conditions. Long corn was
for sale in apparently limitless amounts, how
ever, and the early advance was more than
lost. July closed %c lower.
At thÂ»- opening oats presented a strong front
nn unfavorable crop reports, but eased off
with wheat and corn, closing %c lower
There was a momentary firmness at the start
In provistrns under the Influence of a strong
opening grain market. Packers and pit traders
â old freely and prices broke badly. The mar
ket dragged heavily and closed heavy, with
only a moderate reaction from the bottom
prices. Pork is 12% c lower and lard and ribs
each 5c lower.

CITRUS FRUITS IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, June 16.â The Journal of Com-
merce Bays: Notwithstanding rather liberal
arrivals of lemons at New York during the
past two weeks and the poor condition of a
large part of the stock received, necessitating
careful repacking, the tendency of the market
has been decidedly upward and prices to-day
are fully $2 per box higher than those quoted
on the same grade of goods at the beginning
of the current month. While receipts at New
York have been of late relatively large, re
ceipts here point to the fact that nothing Is
being cent from primary markets to other
ports, and that the whole country, as well as
Canada, Is now entirely dependent for supplies
upon this market. The competition of Cali
fornia lemons, which for a time closed Western
markets to SIHly fruit, Is done, and the recent
activity in imported lemons has been to no
email extent the rpsult of demands from West
ern buyers who pome time since exhausted the
California supplies.
BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, June 16.â The Boston Commercial
Bulletin will say to-morrow of the wool mar
ket: Trading for the week has been limited.
A few good rales have helped owell the total,
but the week as a whole in actual business
has been, very quiet.
This week's business shows Increased sales
of flno medium Territory" and regular combing
Australian. Sales of domestic half and three
eighths blood have decreased In size, owing
partly to a lighter demand and also to the de
pletion of old stocks.
Transactions in new wool are now pending.
The sales of the week are 785.000 pounds de
mestlc and 654.000 pounds foreign, against 961,
000 pounds of domestic and 313,000 pounds of
foreign last week, and 2,941,000 pounds domes
tic and 5.990,000 pounds foreign for the same

render.
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 16.
A | illcexnan pursuing a fleeing man and
firing an occasional shot at tho ground
was the spectacle presented on lower
Washington street this evening.
Seeing ami hearing that the pursuer
meant business, the pursued gave up the
chase after a run of a hlock.
Thomas Burns objects to being confined
In the- county jail. He has a record that
grows the longer he Is In jail and he is
recognized as being the man wanted for
offenses in numerous places. A few days
ago he was arrested for robbery, and as
three stolen watches were In his pocket
when taken, the chances of his spending
i term in the penitentiary are very good.
This afternoon Burns was taken over to
Alaxneda to be examined before Justice-
Morrtss. He was being returned to the
Jail in custody of Constable Yon Kapff
and had passed through the gate. The
constable was formally handing the pris
aner to the jailer when Burns pushed his
way violently through the gate and
3!ainmed it behind him. The prisoner waa
very quick in his movements and jumpeu
li>wti the steps three at a time and started
aJong Fourth Btreet toward Washington.
Yon Kapff at once gave chase. After
turning into Washington street after the
fleeing robber the constable tired a shot
at the ground and Burns turned round
and smiled, then doubled his pace. The
constable then fired a couple more shots?.
letting" them strike the sidewalk In the
ricinity of Burns' feet. This had the de
:irÂ».-d effect and the fleeing robber stopped
uvil allowed himself to he handcuffed and
aken back to the county jail.
Burns is an old crook and it is thought
:hat he may have to answer to more seri
jus' crimes than stealing watches before
he regains his liberty. His break this
ifternoon has greatly strengthened this
jpinion.
DIPLOMAS FOR
HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS
COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES A
SUCCESS.
The Largest Class of Graduates in
trie History of the
School.
The graduating class of the Girls' High
School broke away last night from the
stereotyped form of commencement exer
cises and presented to their friends an en
teru-urinic-i.t worthy of high commenda
tlor. The charm of the exercises lay in
Uh absence of long essays. The pro
gramme waa a mixture of speech-making,
on tr..- part of the municipal educators,
aa<l roucicaJ. on the part of the graduates.
The audieace showed a 'propei 1 ' appreeia
tloii oi both with a preponderance of ap
pi.iUi-â¬ In favor of the young , ladies.
The laigt assembly hall of the Girls'
High &ehool building was crowded to
ovÂ«;rflovnnt; by the friends of the gradn
ate?.. The stage was set at the north end
oÂ£ th-Â» hall, arranged in terraces. Flags
ar;d ps-.iriotic decorations were the back-
ETCur.r". tor the 103 graduates, all dressed
in -whit*. It was a parterre of young
mT'heod with the enthusiasm and the
omen of youth. Each young lady
ie no has now passed the limiting boun
ds ry cf her school-girl days carried a
cmcii of flowers and the picture was one
of ccztipleic uniformity.
The .class marched in to the. music of
z. new march, "White and Gold," com
posed by Miss Florence Hawley, a mem
ber of the clas3 of '99. When the class
â¢Â¥.-Â«!>" BOAtcJ President Charles L. Bairi.i;^
ton- irade a few felicitoui. - remarks, hi
trKJucln? the class to the audience. Then
followed a chorus, "Whirl and Twirl,"
â under the direction of Mrs. Charles Poui
ttr. Slgrior Wanrell sang an aria from
'"Calvator Rosa, " which was so well ap
plauded that it won an encore.
Professor William Cary Jones of the
University of California delivered a short
but patriotic address, paying tribute to
the young ladies of the graduating class
for their self-sacrificing spirit and their
assistance in swelling the donations to
the Red Cross Society. The "Star-span
gled Banner," a concert paraphrase, by
C. Troyer, set the patriotism of the audi
ence on edge. "Aye Maria." a solo and
chorus by Miss Hermione Lask and the
class of '98, was the best received
number on the programme. Miss Lask,
â whose voice is a fine soprano, both strong
and sympathetic, was forced to sing an
encore, which received an equal meed of
applause.
John Swett was called upon for an ad
dreos and received a very flattering re
ception. He told of the progress made
in education in this city v during the last
half century and the great advancement
made in systematic education. A chorus
and solo, "The Star-Spangled Banner," by
Mrs. Charles Poulter, dressed as Colum
bia, with the National emblem in the
hands of soldiers on either side of the
etage, caused the patriotic fervor of the
audience to rise to a high pitch. Several
encores 'were reouired before the audi
ence would be satisfied. The presentation
of diplomas rang the curtain on the
Bcene.

VVIDBER HAS AGAIN
DELAYED HIS TRIAL
MOTION TO SET ASIDE THE
INDICTMENT MADE.
Grand Jurors Will All Be Questioned
Regarding Their Opinions.
Surety Company Pays
the Bond.
Augustus C. Widber, the defaulting
Treasurer, was again before Judge Cook
yesterday morning, but he did not plead
to the indictments -against him. His at
torney, Edgar Peixotto, was ready
with another motion to set aside the
indictments, the merits of which will not
be determined for a week, at least. Peix
otto demanded that the Grand Jury
which found the indictments against his
client be called that he might question
its various members ', regarding, their
opinion of tha case against Widber prior
to linding the true bills against him. The
law allows the challenging of gTand jur
ors, as it does talesmen called to sit dur
ing the trial of a case, who have formed
an opinion irrespective of the evidence
introduced. But three of the grand Jur
ors were questioned during the proceed
ings yesterday. M. H. Hecht, foreman of
the Grand Jury, was first called. In an
swer to Attorney Peixotto's question he
admitted that he had formed an opinion
of the case prior to the hearing before
the Grand Jury, but stated that he cast
that opinion from his mind and was
solely influenced by the evidence placed
before hitn at the hearing. He was chal
lenged by Peixotto, but owing to his
statement that -he was influenced solely
by the evidence the challenge was disal
lowed by the court. 5 George D. Graham
and L. H. Bonestell were called and ex
amined, but as neither had formed an
opinion prior to the j hearing they were
passed without comment. At this point
Hecht informed the court that important
business had to be transacted and asked
the court that the matter be put over for
further hearing. The court consented
and put the case on the calendar for next
Saturday.
The amount of ex-Treasurer Widber's
bond has been paid by the Fidelity and
Deposit Company of Maryland, which
was his surety. F. L. Gilbert, the gen
eral agent of the company, received in
structions yesterday morning to draw on
the company for the amount of the bond,
and a draft was made and was promptly
honored at the Bank of California. The
draft was for $100,816 66, the amount of
the company's liability and interest from
May 3, the date of Treasurer Reis' de
mand for the money. The rapid settle
ment of this large bond is most com
mendatory and is a practical demonstra
tion of the advantage of corporate over
Individual surety, as it is universally con
ceded that had Mr. Widber had personal
sureties the case would in all probability
have remained in the courts for years
and ultimately resulted In loss to the
city and county.

memorable success. The boats leave the

SAN JOSE TO BE

Kindergarten Superin-
tendent Elected.
MISS MACKENZIE'S SINECURE
UNWARRANTABLE ACT OF THE
SCHOOL BOARD.
Shady Proceedings at a Clandestine
Meeting Just Brought to the
Attention of the Tax
payers,
Special Pispatch to The Call.
JOSE, June 16.â Miss Bel Mac-
K'-nzie has been elected Superintend-
C the city kindergartens. This is
iteat exploit of the City Board of
Education, and saddles an additional I
unnecessary expense of $750 per year
upon the city. This action was taken
by th<- board at a clandestine meeting j
on June 30, but the secret has been so 1
carefully guarded thut nearly all the j
people and taxpayers are still un
aware of the matter. On that day the
board held an unannounced meeting,
but the election of Miss MacKensie to I
her positli n \wts not broached.
As soon aa the Bession adjourned,
however, Trustees Kenyon, O'Brien and
Graham held a meeting and passed a |
ution creating the office. The res- :
Q teas pocketed by Kenyon. It!
is not, th< refore, among the records of j
the proceedings.
No mention 01 Miss MacKenzie's elec
tion is to be found among the minutes
meeting In the office or' the City
Superintendent of Schools, although
rman Wemple of the board h;ivs it j
Bhould be on record. It is believed the
I kept the matter quiet on pur- 1
to avoid the condemnation that
is Bure to come from the people of the
city.
Miss MacKenzie is at present prin
of the Cottage Grove Kindergar
ten. She is a sister of Game Warden
John D. MacKenzie and Police Com
missioner Andrew MacKensie, both
sworn and devoted adherents of Boss
Rea,
The position is a sinecure, for there
are only seven kindergartens and
seventeen teachers. Th<- kindergartens
cost this city about $16,000 a year, and
omplaint h;is b^en made, but the;
people of San Jose object to these un- â¢
jsary adjuncts. It is said that
ssistant superintendent of kinder- [
gartens may be elected, and the public 'â 
will not be surprised to learn any day
that a corps of nal nurses had
been employed by the board to look
the children and Bee that they are i
propeny dressed and their hair combed
coming to school.
Trustee Wemple said to-day that
Miss MacKenzie's duties would be to j
order all the stationery and supplies \
of the kindergartens. These had not \
been properly looked after, and so the |
board decided to make a saving in such
things. He said the supplies amount
ed to a great deal in a year, and in
timated that the hiring of Miss Mac-
Kenzie at $75 per month would effect
considerable of a saving. In this he
ia evidently mistaken, for the records
show the supplies of the kindergarten
to cost only about $300 per year.

HUMAN SKELETON FOUND.
Grewsorce Discovery in the Moun-
tains Above Porterville.
VISALIA, June 16.--To-dny Deputy
Bhertff Harrelson brought down from the
mountains above Portervllle a part of a
(skeleton, that was found a few days ago
far up airj'>nÃ the chaparral. As a
citizen of this place named Oscar Cost
llo had suddenly disappeared In that re
gion over two years ago and was thought
to have been murdered, It was at once
supposed by his friends that the bones
belonged to him. It required two or three
hard days' travel to reach the spot where
the bones were found.
Widespread Interest haa been aroused
over the discovery, but some think the
bones are not those of a man. Only the
bones o? the left arm and hand and the
right leg have been recovered. They will
be thoroughly examined. v .~

BARRONS HAVE
COMPROMISED
Widow and Son Reach
an Agreement.
LONG CONTEST ABOUT ENDED
TRUSTEES OF GEORGE'S FUND
RESIGN.
Eva Rose to Assume Their Duties,
Pay the Young Man's Obliga
tions and Settle the Legal
Expenses.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, June 16.â George E. Bar
ron, contestant of the will of Million
aire Edward Barron, and Eva Rose
Barron, the widow, have agreed upon
the terms of a compromise and the first
steps to end the long litigation were
taken to-day in Judge Hyland's court.
Maurice O'Brien and John E. Auzer
ais, trustees of the $100,000 trust fund
created for George Barron by his fa
ther, tendered their resignations. Their
reason for doing so was that the con
testant and widow may reach a com
promise, stop the expensive litigation
and adjust their respective rights.
Judge Hyland at once made an order
accepting the resignations, no moneys
for the trust ever having come into the
trustec-s' hands.
George E. Barron then filed a petition
asking that Eva Rose Barron be ap
pointed trustee to fill the vacancy
caused by the resignations c f Messrs.
O'Brien and Auzerais. The petition re
cttes that the will of Edward Barron,
deceased, contained a trust in the sum
of $100,000 in favor of petitioner and
that Eva Rose Barron is willing to ac
cept the trusteeship. This matter will
be heard June 27.
It is understood that by the terms of
the compromise the outgoing trustees
will be paid and also their attorneys;
that Eva Rose Barron will qualify as
trustee and assume all responsibilities;
that out of the money of the trust,
amounting, with interest, to nearly
$130,000, about $70,000 will be devoted to
the payment of George E. Barron's in
debtedness in notes, expenses of litiga
tion, etc., and that the balance shall
remain as a trust, he to receive the in
terest therefrom. The compromise also
contemplates the distribution of the es
tate, which Is worth about $1,800,000, un
der the terms of the will and the ter
mination of all litigation In connection
therewith. __^^^_^______
SHE WOULD NOT GIVE
UP HER COMPANION
STRANGE ACCIDENT TO AN IN
DIGNANT HUSBAND.
C. H. Brown, Angered at His Wife,
Tears Down Their Marriage Cer
tificate and Receives a
Bad Wound.
Falling to convince his wife of the error i
of her way, C. H. Brown, a longshoreman, j
last night tore down the marriage certlfl- j
cate that made them one and In doing so j
he had his left arm badly cut. The |
Browns live at 316 Third street.
A short time ago Mrs. Brown informed 'â 
her husband that she was going away !
with a companion named Maggie Kauf- j
man, with whom she was on very inti
mate terms. Brown objected to his wife j
associating with the Kaufman woman,
for the reason, so he claimed, that she
was not a proper person. Despite his en- i
treaties Mrs. Brown packed her trunk
and went away with Mrs. Kaufman. They ;
returned a few days ago and announced
that they had been in Santa Cruz.
When Brown returned from his work
last evening he was met by his wife, who
! informed him that she and Mrs. Kaufman
had decided to take another trip to the
country. I-Irown seriously objected and
told hla better half that if she insisted on
going with Mrs. Kaufman he would
iiii-cik up house.
"You will have to give her up," he de
' clared. with emphasis, "or you and I will
henceforth meet as strangers." Mrs.
Brown refused to part with h^r friend,
and told her husband that he might do as
he pleased. Angered at the remark,
Brown tore down their marriage certifi
cate, which was hanging on the wall, and
in doing so he broke the glass frame, se-
I verely cutting his arm. His wife, think
ing that lie was seriously injured, called a
policeman and had him take her husband
to the Receiving Hospital. Drs. Torney
and Rumm-ll found that several arteries
had been severed, and after considerable
trouble they managed to stop the flow of
blood. Brown told the doctors that he
strongly suspected that Mrs. Kaufman
was endeavoring to cause trouble between
himself and wife. He is determined to
separate them, and unless his wife gives
her up he pays he will commence proceexl-
I ings looking for a separation.

THIEVING

MAY ESCAPE
The Ferry Depot and
the Grand Jury.
WEAK-KNEED INVESTIGATION
HUMORS OF A RING FORMED
FOR PROTECTION PURPOSES.
Beginning of the Inquiry Marked by
Tactics That Led to the Fall
of a Former Inquisitorial
Body.
Yesterday the Grand Jury began an
investigation of the gross frauds that
have been practiced in connection with
the construction of the new ferry de
pot building. Several witnesses were
examined, but the inquiry was con
ducted in such a manner as to lead to
the conclusion that the same influences
that were at work on the last Grand
Jury, the discovery of which led to the
summary dismissal of that body, are
again being exerted for the purpose of
Shielding the officials and contractors
who have robbed the State of more
than $100,000.
When the matter was taken up by
the last Grand Jury a number of wlt
:fl were examined and their depo
sitions were taken with sufficient show
of interest to carry out the farce and
make it appear that the inquiry was
being conducted in all seriousness. Not
withstanding this the fraud that was
g practiced was discovered before
the pretended inquiry was concluded,
and an end was put to the farce by the
summary dismissal of the jury. The
present jury seems to have dispensed
with even the pretense of a system
atic inquiry, and the witnesses that
hiive so far been examined have been
dismissed after being subjected to a
few perfunctory interrogatories.
Those who are familiar with the work
of the jury since its organization are
of the opinion that the body is dom
inated by what is known as a Grand
Jury "ring," and that this ring has
been formed for the purpose of protect
ing the interests of such persons as
may demonstrate their fitness for a
place in the ranks of those who are to
be protected.
It is well known that the men who
have profited by the frauds that have
been practiced in connection with the
construction of the ferry building have
been and are now exerting themselves
In .every possible way to avert the le
gitimate consequences of their unlaw
ful acts. It is equally well known that
a Jury of blind men would be able to
discover the frauds that have been per
ited if it were actuated by an hon
est desire to do so. Should the present
inquiry by the Grand Jury be further ;
prosecuted and concluded in the way it
haa beeii begun the officials and conrj
tractors who have robbed the State of
a sum exceeding $100,000 need be in no
fear that their acts will r-^ult in any
greater punishment than that inflicted
by the pricking of a guilty conscience.
The first witness examined yesterday
waa William H. Taylor, president of the
Risdon Iron Works. He is one of the
persons who have a partial knowledge
of the facts connected with the change
in the original plans and specifications
of the various doors in the ferry build
ing. By this change wooden doors were
substituted for the iron doors originally
provided for, a substitution that re
sulted in a loss to the State of about
$4000.
P. McG. McÃean told the jury what
it cared to hear of the manner in which
the contract for terra cotta work was
let out and afterward manipulated to
the advantage of Contractor McCarthy,
who was the successful bidder, and who
profited by the favor of President Col-
Don "f the State Board of Harbor Com
missioners.
T. J. Ford, who made an expert ex
amination of the plumbing system in
stnlled in the ferry building, was also
called as a witness. His complete

confidential clerk with the Pacific Rolling
Mills Company; is a defaulter, and the po
lice are straining every effort to find him,
but so f;ir without success.
Isaksen entered the company's service
in 1888, when a boy, and gradually rose till
he filled the responsible position of mak
ing the company's collections, for which
he drew a good salary. As the company
is closing down its business Isaksen was
notified on May 31 that his services were
no longer required.
An expert has been examining the com
pany's books and discovered certain en
tries and transpositions that puzzled him.
A note was Bent to Isaksen's residence,
1022 Washington street, asking him to call
and explain the apparent discrepancies,
and last Tuesday afternoon he telephoned
to the expert that he would call and ex
plain matters later.
Wednesday morning Patrick Noble,
manager of the company, on opening his
mail, found a notification from the South
ern Pacific Company to caii at the pay
master's office and collect $2100 due on
May bills. He went to the office and pre
sented the order, and was t or.siderably
astonished when informed that the
amount had been collected by Isaksen the
previous afternoon. He immediately
made President Neal acquainted With the
fact and Chief Lees was communicated
with. The chief gave positive instruc
tions that the affair should be kept se
cret, but it leaked out yesterday.
Several detectives have been searching
for Isaksen, but no trace of him has been
tound since last Monday morning, when
he was seen by a friend, S. O. Delamater
ot Aliller, Bcloss & Scott. There is a
suspicion that he went with one of the.
transports that sailed last Wednesday for
Manna, lie was an ex-metnlier oi the
National Guard, and as he had his uni
form it would have been an easy thing
for him to get aboard.
Isaksen is an athletic-looking young
man about 25 years of age. He is about
five feet nine inches tall, fair complexion,
with short curly fiaxen hair and a mus
tache of the same hue. For four weeks
up to May 30 he lived at Belvedere on an
ark with Humphrey Sullivan and S. O.
Delamater. His widowed mother left for
Norway early In May.
What his defalcations are besides the
$2100 collected from the Southern Pacific
is not known, as the company refuses to
discuss the matter, but it is supposed to
be considerable.
The paymaster of the Southern Pacific
said yesterday that he had been paying
money to Isaksen as representative of thj
company for the past four years, and
when he called for it on Tuesday ho paid
it without question. Isaksen did not ap
pear to be In any way excited and his
manner was cool and collected.
I.saksen's downfall is attributed to riot
ous living. lie was fond of late suppers
and spent money lavishly on women and
wine. He also indulged in the luxury of
yachting and was a frequenter of the
racecourse.
Last night there was a well-defined ru
mor that Isaksen had gone to Salt Lake,
and the wires were kept hot in anticipa
tion of his arrest. Descriptions of him
have been sent broadcast by the police,
and if he has not gone to Manila they
hope to have him cornered soon.
One Case at a Time.
The Supreme Court has decided that
certain testimony introduced at the trial
of Francisco Vidal in the Superior Court
of San Luis Obiapo County should never
have been admitted. Vidal was convicted
of grand larceny for stealing a horse. The
arresting officer was allowed to testily
that at the time of the arrest he was
hunting for Vidal for another crim."!. Tlio
accused was riding a stolen horse at the
time. At the trial the defendant offered
no evidence. The Supreme Court reversed
the verdict of the lower court, holding
that the introduction of evidence of an
other crime in the trial of the case of
horse stealing was prejudicial to the de
fendant.
Carney's Trial Under Way.
The trial of John L. Carney for the mur
der of Victor Durand was begun before
Judge Cook 'yesterday morning. After
liv. jurora had been secured a continuance
was taken until this morning.

PASSED TO FINAL REST.
Miss Sophie A. Grote, the Late Grand Presi
dent of the Young Ladies' Institute.
Miss Sophie A. Grote, grand president of the Young Ladies' Institute,
passed away from earth yesterday at the residence of her mother on Golden
Gate avenue, after an Illness of a few weeks.
Miss Grote, who was a teacher in the Golden Gate Primary School, was
a native daughter and was most popular in the order of which she was the
head, and her loss will be deeply felt by all who had the good fortune of her
friendship or acquaintance. Nearly two years ago she was chosen the head
of the charitable organization at the session of the Grand Council of the
Young Ladles' Institute, and up to within a few weeks ago she devoted
much of her time and energy in the upbuilding of the order and the diffusion
of its principles. The last official work sha did was the institution of a new
institute in San Jose, and on her return from there she contracted a cold
which brought on the illness which placed her beyond the skill of physicians
and the ministering of a devoted mother, loving sisters and brothers, and
many warm friends.
She leaves, besides a widowed mother, two sisters and two brothers.

Sunday and a diagnosis of his case ascer
tained the fact that he was suffering from
cancer of the stomach and it was decided
that the organ must be removed in or
der to save the suffering man's life.
An incision was made in the upper part
of the abdominal cavity and through this
the stomach was removed. A connection
! of the esophagus, or food passage. waÂ»
made with the duodenum, that portion of
the alimentary canal just below the stom
ach, by means of a Murphy button. This
is a silver device to which the ends of
the organs are sutured and the connection
is complete.
If Partitti survives the effects of the
operation he will suffer but little incon-
I venience and will be in better health than
| he has been for many months past.

IN NEED OF BETTER SCHOOLS.
Mission Road ard Silver Heights
Claim to Be' Neglected.
The residents of Mission mad and Sil
ver Heights are of the opinion that they
have been sadly neglected by the School
Directors in not providing that sec
tion of the city with school buildings cap
able of accommodating all the children
who are anxious to participate in the
benefit of a public school education; and
they go further and find fault with the
board for the kind of temporary buildings
provided to receive the overflow from the
Munro Primary. There are two buildings
in use, either or both of which are unfit
for the use for which they are being oc
cupied. â¢
In both the wind whistles through the
cracks and crevices of the rough boarding
put up for outer walls, while the flooring
exposes seams between the misfit boards,
placed on rickety joists.
At the present time there are over 800
children for whom there are no suitable
accommodations, even in the temporary
cowsheds. This the taxpaying citizens of
the Mission consider to be anything but
right and just to themselves* and ' their
children. The Improvement Club of this
district will try hard to prevail on the
Supervisors to make a sufficient appropri
ation in the next tax levy to build a suit
able schoolhouse.
