PEACEFUL WATERS
Joyous Welcome Given the Vic
torious Fleet on Its Return
to New York,
Battle - Scarred Fighting Craft Fire a National
Salute at the Tomb of General
Grant.
TTEW YORK, Aug. 20.â Hundreds of
thousands of people along the banks of
the Hudson, and thousands on all
styles of river craft, blended their
â shouts in a royal Welcome to the re
' turned North Atlantic squadron under
command of Rear Admiral Sampson,
and as fine an August day as could be
desired was Nature's tribute to the re
turning victors. For almost three solii
hours 6team whistles, steam sirens and
email guns along the shores shrieked
and boomed in the effort to display the
heartiest enthusiasm for the home
coming of the naval heroes with their
battle-scared ships.
Early in the morning the seven big
shipsâ the New York, lowa. Indiana,
Brooklyn, Massachusetts, Oregon and
â¢Texasâ lay In New York Bay. Just off
Tompkinsville. There was no idea with
Admiral Sampson that New York was
â¢ prepared for a rousing reception, but
the news was brought shortly by a tug
from : a navy yard, and all the ships of
the squadron were immediately put
under preparations for dress review.
By 9 o'clock the big, dull-looking
fighting ships, looming high above Uw
picturesque confusion of the smaller
craft, which had come down to get a
glimpse of the ships, were ready for
movement. Strung out along their
decks, in long, regular lines, were the
white uniformed "ackies, with here and
there a blue-coated officer, all strongly
contrasted against the somber, lead
colored armor of the ships.
When the hour for the start came.^ It
. looked as if it would be impossible for
the great ships to make their way
through the jam of river craft.. Ve*
pels of all descriptions, from the small
est Steam launch to the great ocean
liner, were banked around the squad
ron. Cheers and shouts of welcome
arose from every deck, and the boats'
' Whtetlefl all joined in the shouts.
Suddenly there was a movement on
. fhe flagship New York as the big ship
started forward with a slow, stately
glide. She was quickly followed by the
other six vessels in the following or
der: lowa, Indiana, Brooklyn, Massa
. chusetts, Oregon, Texas. It was some
time before the ships could get into re
view formation, but by the time the
New- York's prow came into line with
'â â 'â  Governors Island the other ships had
formed in regular line.
.The start was made, accompanied by
.tremendous cheering, screeching whis
ties and booming cannon. From Castle
William came the first salute. It was
merely a flash of bright red, which was
immediately smothered in a sheet of
â¢'â /â¢smoke before the detonation was heard.
Then came the roar across the waters,
â  and the ships headed right into the
â¢ r}ver on the way to General Grant's
. -tomb,
:'v\All along the line,, on piers, on sheds,
.*h/ipsoM a.nd "Â«vÂ«ry Dosslble Dolnt of

i craft, crowding the warships close,
i were jammed with passengers, sinking
I the sides of the vessels almost to their
i guard rails on one side, giving the Im
| pression that even the ships themselves
i bowed in unconscious salute to the re
'< turning naval heroes. The width of the
i Hudson River was a struggling, flut
i tering, darting mass of color and con
fusion and cheers. As the vessels
' moved further up the river the water,

j was churned by the action of the hun
! dreds of steamers, and waves dashed
over the small boats and sheets of
I spray dampened the passengers on the
lower decks of the larger steamers.
As the grim looking battleships
moved up the river the crowds became
denser and the enthusiasm was more
marked. At Riverside drive, with its
s f pop, grassy slope, the scene was like
an amphitheater. Tens of thousands
of persons covered the green slope and
as the battleships approached a mighty
cheer arose that reverberated back and
forth across the Hudson.
From the bottom of the slope an
observation train crawled lazily along,
keeping even with the ships. Above
was the vast sea of humanity crowding
General Grant's tomb, which was to
i mark the beginning of the return of the
.squadron, and where a national salute
of twenty-one guns was fired. The
tomb, standing high, white and solemn,
was far above the waters of the river
and looked as if built on a foundation
of faces.
For the first time in the parade, the
b-itleships drew together. Just at the
point of return there was a momen
tary lull, as if expecting a climax.
Suddenly from the sides and turrets of
the battleships there was a vivid flash,
loilovlng this a tremendous roar, an
nouncing the first gun of the national
salute.
The leavy smoke curled and tumbled
down toward the water and up into the
air until the ships had been almost hid
den, but the roar, coming again and
again, seemed to rock the waters them
selves. It was an imposing spectacle
as the big battleships boomed a sa
lute to the nation; as the warships
saluted the final resting place of Gen
eral Grant and the guns that sounded
the knell of .Admiral Cervera's ships at
Santiago boomed a reverent obeisance
to the dead aero.
The salute ended, the return of the
squadron alonp the line of review was
begun. It wa* a repetition of the en
thusiastic sceripp on the "way up the
river. Every vhistle that could be
brought into use played its part; every
bell, every band joined in honoring the
fleet and above ell were the resound
ing echoes of the^phouts from on water
and on land. \

thirty-five minutes.
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
REGARDING THE TERMS
War Officials Inclined to Believe the
Capitulation Involves All the
Philippine Islands.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 20.â Official an
nouncement of the terms of capitula
tion agreed on at Manila . reached the
War Department this evening in a dis
patch from Major General Merritt. It
was the first notification, officially, of
the nature of the capitulation and em
braced the complete terms in six arti
cles. There is considerable difference
of opinion as to the exact significance
of the terms of capitulation, but the
best opinion obtainable to-night con
strued the language to embrace all
Spanish possessions In the Philippines
and not Manila alone.
It is pointed out that the word "sub
urbs" is an elastic expression, and the
language of article one, stating that
the Spanish troops, both the European
and the native, capitulate, "with" the
city and defenses, goes to emphasize
this construction. This is the view, ex
j pressed by war officials, and considered
i in this light goes to confirm the press
! dispatches stating that the capitulation
involves the whole Philippines.
All the unsettled points in the terms
I of surrender will have to be finally de
i termined by the President, though
1 there Is no doubt that he will approve
whatever agreement General Merritt
makes.
The terms make no reference to the
harbor and strictly provide for land
occupations. Admiral Dewey, however,
| has made no report of the terms.
SECRECY IN MAKING
ARMY APPOINTMENTS
President Urged to Aid the Families
of Officers Killed at
Santiago.
NEW YORK, Aug. 20.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Re-
cent promotions and appointments )n
the army for some unexplained reason
have been kept a profound secret. It is
known, however, that the President has
during the last ten days made a num
ber of appointments under pressure
from different quarters. The appoint
ments have for the most part been sec
ond lieutenants. The most meritorious
class of these, however, will be sons or
relatives of officers who were killed or
wounded during the campaign at San
tiago.
About ten days ago the Secretary of
War by direction of the President, ad
dressed letters to families of these of
ficers asking if there were sons avail
able for appointments. One reply was
received from the widow of Lieutenant
Colonel J. M. Hamilton of Brooklyn,
who was killed at Santiago, saying that
there were three girls, and she regret
ted, therefore, that she was unable to
avail herself of the kind offer of the
President. '
GENERAL PANDO'S FLIGHT.
Spanish Commander Arrives Incog
nito in Mexico.
WASHINGTON, Aur. 20.â The State
Department received a telegram to-day
from Consul Thompson at Progreso,
Mexico, stating that General Pando,
the Spanish general, second in com
mand to Blanco, had arrived incognito
at Progreso yesterday on the Mexican
steamer Campeche. The Consul says
General Pando seeks to enter Havana
or Batabano, Cuba, on the British
steamer Gulllermo Lopez. When last
heard of General Pando was alleged
to be In command of the Spanish forces
at Manzanillo, Cuba.

INCENDIARISM AND
RIOTING CONTINUE
IN PORTO RICO

Over the Island Destroyed

Twenty-Nine Houses in the Town of Coto
Burned and the Business Places
Looted.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1808,
by Jimea Gordon Bennett.
PONCE, Porto Rico. Aug. 20.âTurbu
lent affairs continue, apparently
growing out of the violence connected
with the partial destruction of the vil
lage of Coto yesterday, followed by nu
merous fires last night.
Several houses of Spanish residents
were burned in Vauco during the night,
and this morning reports show that in
cendiaries have been at work destroy
ing haciendas and sugar mills all over
the island.
Evidence is accumulating showing
the existence of a plot among the na
tives to destroy the property of Span
ish residents. There is no longer any
reasonable doubt that the incendiarism
is the result of concerted action which
probably originated in Ponce, where
vengeful sufferers of the inquisition of
1888 have congregated since the Ameri
can occupation.
The country is infested by guerrillas
who dally commit outrages similar to
but less extensive than the Caiks mas
sacre. The American troops cannot
suppress these guerrillas who commit
depredations and then retreat into ter
tory held by the Spanish, whither the
spirit of armistice prevents pursuit.
These outrages have stirred the na
tives to desperation. They demand re
venge. The riotous demonstrations in
this locality are the result. Riots will
become more general unless Governor
General Macias promptly suppresses
the guerrillas.
General Miles issued an order to dis
arm the natives as a means of prevent
ing retaliation, but General Henry re
fused to deprive the natives of their
arms in the neighborhood of Utuado,
where arms are the only means of de
fense against the depredations of the
Spanish guerrillas who are infesting
the mountains.
NEW YORK, Aug. 20.â A cable to
the Sun from Ponce says: Twenty
nine houses in the town of Coto were
burned yesterday by Porto Ricans.
Two other houses were torn down, and
a bank and all of the business houses
were looted.
Coto is a small town five miles from
Ponce. Half the population are Span
ish and the stores belonged to them.
A night watchman who was on guard
was held up at 5 o'clock in the morn
ing by three Porto Ricans. who thrust
revolvers into his face and threatened
to- kill him. The watchman ran away,
and the men then lighted torches ar.d
began to destroy property. They chop
ped in doors, tore off and smashed in
blinds and finally set fire to one block
of the finest buildings in town, owned
by Spaniards And containing all the
business of the place.
The Spanish residents fled to the

woods. The mob attacked the bank
building with pickaxes and shovels and
succeeded in smashing the vault, but
they got very little cash.
After rifling the vault t>f its contents
the mob set fire to the building, the
crowd cheering as the flames rose in the
air and yelling "Death to Spain!"
'"Death to the Spanish!" etc.
When the disorder was at its height
Major ParkhiM of General Wilson's

BERLIN PRESS DISCUSS
THE PROTOCOL'S TERMS.
Copyrighted, IS9S, by the Associated PreÂ»Â«.
BERLIN, Aug. 20.â The signing of the
protocol' engrosses the attention of the
press. The more serious papers and
nearly all the periodicals appearing
this week take the view that Spain has
only herself to blame, and that the con
ditions imposed by the United States
are not excessive.
The Cologne Gazette, discussing the
situation at Manila, highly praises the
American naval officers, expressing its
confidence that their efforts will soon
restore complete order so that business
can be conducted safely. It adds: "Now
that the star-spangled banner waves
all danger to German commercial in
terests is past."
The Berliner Tageblatt congratulates
Admiral Dewey on his promotion, and
says he understands how to preserve
friendly and correct relations with the
German squadron, even during diffi
culties.
The political and economic relations
of the United States and Germany are
also much discussed. United States
Kmbassador White is highly praised
for his unceasing efforts to re-establish
them on a thoroughly friendly basis.

AMERICA'S FLAG FLOATS OVER
THE LAND OF THE KANAKAS
HONOLULU'S LAST DAY
AS CAPITAL OF THE
REPUBLIC OF HAWAII
Events on the Eve of August 12, 1898, When the
Island FlaÂ£ Was Replaced by the Emblem
of American Authority.
Gentle Natives Were Disconsolate, and From the Gardens of Ex-Queen
: Liliuokalani Came the Sound of Wailing Over a
Nation's Death.
BY ALICE RIX.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Aug. 11.â Twelve o'clock
and all is well. The whistles are sound-
Ing a last noon for the Hawaiian flag.
When the hands have gone around the
clock again to midday the Hawaiian
flag will have passed down a page
of history to take Its place among the
things that were.
Tn-morrow at 12 o'clock, noon, on
Friday, August 12, IS9B, the Stars and
Stripes of America will be raised over
her new possessions.
This naked fact, by detail unadorned,
has been given to the world. The pro
gramme of the ceremony remains a
tender confidence among officials and
cannot be begged or bully-ragged out
of them. Personally I have not had
recourse to either of these methods, but
I can certify that polite questioning
availeth nothing.
Since Admiral Miller sailed under
sealed orders into Honolulu harbor, and
was known to have sealed orders for
United States Minister Sewall in his
pocket, the seal has been distinctly
fashionable In official circles. Not a
man moving in them will tell so much
ns the time o' day. The official walk
has become a stealthy tread. The offi
cial voice has discovered a scale of
whispers; the official eye doth
darkly wink and the official
mannerâ Ai! We have no word,
dark, bodeful, mysterious enough, in
Dur free, frank tongue to paint the offi
cial manner. It should be done in Dan
ish, to Peer Gynt music.
I suppose there is somt> good and
sufficient reason for all this and an
other reason for not explaining that
one. The United States Minister is
doubtless acting under orders from
Washington, and no one else can divulge
what he refuses to tell. Mr. Sewall Is
too diplomatic to offend, too clever to
have made this mistake. The form of
government which shall succeed the
I â¢ - nt republic is a fact which belongs
to the people of Hawaii, to say nothing
of the people of the United States. It
is nut entirely impertinent curiosity
which st-eks to lift :he veil. Washing
ton evidently thinks otherwise. But in
th<Â» countenance of McKinley I wish to
remark that all this mystery savors
more of court intrigue than of the
avowedly free methods of our govern
ment of, for and by the people.
The people, as here represented, are,
largely speaking, furious. They want
to know how they arc to be governed
and by whom. They will know to-mor
n.w when the proclamation is read and
not beforeâ not if the United States
Minister can help it. In the meantime,
since the coming of the Philadelphia,
speculation has been wide. I was told
by an authority next door to being su
preme that there will be little if any
change in the internal administration
executive or judicial â either now or on
the coming of the Commissioners. The
situation will wait on Congress.
M.-antime everybody will be in office
who is in office now, except the Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, whose office,
like that of the United Statvs Minister,
ceases to exist. It is confidently sup
posed by everybody that a place will
be found or created for Mr. Sewall by
the administration, with which he is
so popular. He denies that he will be
Governor, and says there will be no
Governor at all. Very few accept the
statement as frankly as it is offered.
As I am in the habit of believing people
whose word ought to be worth some
thing, I print his statement for a
fact.
I would that I might also print his
proclamationâ for which I asked him
genially and which he as genially re
fused.
There 1b something, I think, even in
not getting what you want under
agreeable auspices.
As far as may be determined by the
unofficial mind, aided by the grudgring
Information that can be raked and
scraped together, the ceremony, so
long expected, so enthusiastically
awaited, and for which a number of
â¢ good people, including the present
scribe, have Journeyed two thousand
one hundred and something miles to
see and to record, will occupy perhaps
ten or fifteen minutes â the time con
sumed by the mere mechanical action
of lowering one flag and raising an
other. It is even possible that the
flag may be raised from the tower of
the Executive Building instead of from
the ground, when, of course, another
five minutes can be chopped off to
make the ceremony deeper still.
The Annexation Club, which held
over two tons of fireworks from the
Fourth of July stock for the purpose
: 0f bombing, rocketing and otherwise
exploding its national joy and has
planned for songs, speeches and exer
cises of the day, so dear to political
organizations of all climes, was
snubbed with the information that the
programme would be strictly official
and referred to the opera-house and
their new devices for whatever enter
tainment pleased them best. Later an
indignant delegation of the men who
had given heart, blood and bone to the
annexation movement waited on Mr.
Sewall and put the case pleadingly be
fore him, and now I believe they are
to be allowed In at the tail of the of
ficial programme.
Of course the passing of the Ha
waiian flag will receive the Ironic cour
tesy of a salute. The same that will
raise our own flag above its fallen
head. It makes no difference to the
cannon's- throat what tune it sings.
"Hawaii Ponoi" and "The Star
spangled Banner" from the band, Joy
â¢ to Americans and sorrow to Hawaiians,
are what we may presuppose without
official assistance. The natives In num
bers will shut themselvea in their
homes to-morrow. Some, including the
Princess Kaiulani, have already
left the island. The Queen will mourn
In her house in sound and sight of the
ceremoniesâ as she has been all along â
with United States troops in camp be
fore the Hawaiian Barracks, and
! her own band playing the martial n usic
of that Union of which she has become
an unwilling part. Wailing sounds
from her gardens day and night. The
sentiment of Hawalians is single â a
broad stream flowing from unnumbered
sources â grief at extinction which they
realize is the ultimate result of annex
ation, while the broadest minded
among them admit its advantages over
the present form of government.
I went the day before yesterday to
the Executive Building to look on at
what was reported to be the United
States Minister's last official visit to
President Dole to be paid in company
with Admiral Miller and a glittering,
gold-laced naval train. The last official
visit of the last United States Minister
to the last President of the Hawaiian
republic â which is the Hawaiian repub
lic no more â is history. I thought I
ought to be there if only for the grati
fication of saying to my grandchildren:
"And you should have seen the admi
ral, my dears, a most distinguished
man, in the splendid uniform they wore
in those days."
And after all it was only the visit of
courtesy the admiral himself was pay
ing to the President, although the
splendid uniforms and the distinguish
ed presence were in evidence. The navy
arrived early â too early by ten min
utes â and gave one a chance to admire
and to pity, for the day was one of the
scorching, breathless sort which come
between the sweet trade winds, and
full dress uniform is as stuffy as It is
splendid. Mr. Sewall arrived punctu
ally on time, faultlessly attired accord-
Ing to our lackluster views of what is
fit in man's attire, and, as usual, im
perturbably cool.
Mr. Sewall is always cool, or, at
least, he has the thin, dry gift of never
looking warm, which must be of in
finite use to a diplomat in this climate.
The Hawaiian Guard was on compli
mentary parade, and the Hawaiian
band discoursed the Sousa strains, and
the executive grounds were gay, any
way, with preparations for feasting the
St. Paul's troops. The tables were
spread under long arbors stretched
with some long, dried grass or leaves,
with reminiscent early Hawaiian effect.
I wish I might have seen this land
when everybody lived under a thatch.
I dare say I should not have been half
so comfortable as I find myself at the
Hawaiian Hotel, where the comforts of
life and the joys of a civilized society
are found, but the visit would have
pleased me more. Honolulu has a few
good old Southern many porticoed
houses standing knee deep in her
sweeps of moist, sweet green, but ar
chitecture is, for the most part, rigid
and characterless, except for such char
acter as you find in New England vil
lages too young for one's respect. The
Executive Building, which was the old
Palace, is pretentious, but hardly
splendid enough, one would think, to
have pleased a King.
On this particular hot morning Chi
nese and Japs are shuffling about with
baskets, layin- tables under the
long, thatched arbors, and early girls
in pale muslins and big summery hats
made pictures of themselves against
the sumptuous green.
The St. Paul's troops were marched
in before I left. They are as fit as you
please, in good health, spirits and form,
the gayest lot of men to march in and
out of Honolulu since I have been here.
They came up Hotel street in step
to a mighty whistling chorus which
they have got down â or rather vp â to
shrill perfection. I did not think "A
Hot Time" could offer further variety
to my wearied ear, but It gathers a
quite new warmth whistled 900 strong
with Jovial castanet effects in tin cups
and the tramp, tramp of 1800 feet. The
troops had excellent care, well-cooked
food and shower baths on the trip
down, and the immeasurable advantage
of change to camp here, and so will
go on to the front, armed for climatic
disadvantages and the fortunes of war.
If, as General Merrltt said to me, an
officer should consider his 'troops as his
children, their commanding officers
and Colonel Barber are among the best
fathers in the army.
Colonel Barber was still looking for
a site for the garrison when I last saw
him this morning.
"ThiP will be an expensive port, any
way," he said, "and the Government
naturally does not like expense. I
hoped to find a tract of Government
land lying about somewhere, but I
haven't found anything at all suitable
yet. There Is a lonely stretch lying out
beyond Waikiki, close against Diamond
Head, in a little gap through which the
wind always finds a way. and I shall
look into that to-morrow."
The truth is that the Hawaiian Gov
ernment has leased large stretches of
the best Government lands for periods
of from five to twenty years. Even
since the islands have been annexed
to the United States a large tract _of
fine land has been leased, which would
have furnished an ideal camping
ground for the American troops.
I spoke to Colonel Barber about the
new Military Hospital which is about
to open at the old Independence Park.
The Park Is better adapted for a rice
field than for any other purpose, for
it lies under water all through the
rainy season, and Is a spot to breed
rather than curb disease. He said he
hoped it would do at least until the
rains set in, and shook his head dis
tractedly, and I felt that I had most
unwillingly added tq his woes.
Since poor Hawaii must lose her
head, a more merciful executioner than
Admiral Miller could never have been
found.
Coming on this mission, which means
to the Hawaiians the loss of all they
hold dear â flag, country, name and
race identity â he meets the respect,

I wail. I like to think so, for I feel
â  great sympathy and liking for the Ha
waiian people. Now, this much of the
i raising of the flag. We all like to see
; our flag going up, but I think no one
can see the flag of a country come
down without sadness, certainly not
; that of a country never hostile to us
jor to our interests. I have the Ha
walians at heart in this matter. I
have saluted their flag many times. It
is forty-one years since I first sailed
into this port, and I have many friends
here. This is one reason lam strong
ly against a demonstration and gen
eral rejoicing among our people to
morrow. There will be many sad
hearts in Honolulu to-morrow, and
there are all the reasons of tact, deli
cacy and consideration against mak
ing them any heavier."

HONOLULU, Aug. 10.â There are
twenty-six United States soldiers in the

Coolie Labor Trouble Averted.
HONOLULU, Aug. 11.â Diplomacy
has averted the trouble which was
thought imminent with the Japanese
contract laborers. The Hawaiian Gov
ernment in a friendly manner called
the attention of the Japanese Legation
to the fact of current rumors In regard
to the Japanese laborers striking and
creating trouble and disturbance. Mr.
Shimamura's successor, Consul Eleve
Hirai, at once promptly took the mat
ter up and issued an authoritative cir
cular to the laborers and agencies
warning them and compelling them to
proceed with their labor and to await
the opportunity of testing their condi
tions before the law courts. Any Im
proper conduct on their part would be
attended with the displeasure of the
Japanese Government.

FAIR PASSENGER
ON A TROOPSHIP
TO THE ISLANDS
Wife of Major Nickerson Carried
to by the Transport
St. Paul.
Eight Hundred Volunteers Awed by the
Presence of a Single Woman
Aboard.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY ALICE RIX.
HONOLULU. Aug. 11.â The St. Paul
steamed Into the harbor on the even
ing of August 6 with eight hun
dred men and one woman on board.
In the sensation created by the
landing of the one woman the
eight hundred men passed compara
tively unnoticed.
She was so entirely unexpected that
for all she Is a little woman and light
of foot as thistle down, she came over
the side of the ship like a bomb.
The crowd which gathers to greet
and speed each ship that comes to port
put up its glasses and gasped politely
as petticoats were perceived to flutter
on the deck of the St. Paul. Nobody
knew whose petticoats they were. No
body knew that Major A. H. Nickerson,
who comes to Honolulu as commissary
general to the post to be established
here by Colonel Barber, had asked and
got permission from the War Depart
ment to bring his wife with him. Liv
ing as we do two thousand miles from
a lemon, the first woman who ever
traveled on a troopship had to sail into
port, her journey ended, before we got
the news of her starting.
Thoae in daily touch with telegraph
and cable cannot conceive the sweet
suspense of not perceiving what is hap
pening in the wide, wide world or the
lovely gratification of finally finding
out. Finding out about Mrs. Nicker
son was the most exciting event of the
week. The joys of speculation were
exhausted long before she landed on
Honolulu ground. Speculation was nat
urally limited to the idea that she was
a stowaway.
I met her later in the day at the Ha
waiian Hotel, and she told me how she
happened to take the trip on the troop-
I ship and also how she liked it. She Is
I a Southern woman â '"a Cyarter," as
sht saysâ with sweet, soft eyes and a
sweet, soft speech, and is related to the
arm/ through brothers, uncles and
cousins first, second and third. Major
Nickerson has been thirty yearc in the
service. Their friends are among the
powers that be and whatever influence
was needed to obtain the necessary or
der could be found, so to speak, in the
family. Major Nickerson was in Chick
amauga and his wife in Washington
at the time of his appointment to the
I Honolulu post, and Mrs. Nickerson
1 made swift preparation to meet her
husband in San Francisco.
"I had the most exciting time getting
ready," she said, "more excitement by
far than I had on the ship. I had no
time at all to begin with, and th^n it
seemed such an odd thing to be doing.
Army women get used to sudden
jumps, you know, but this was a jump
in a new direction. There are my girl
friends in Washington, who were wild
over the idea. They thought it would
be great larks to be the only woman on
board a troopship. I think there wasn't
one of them who wouldn't have gone
in my place, and of course it would have
been girly for a girl."
And Mrs. Nickerson, who is still a
good deal of a girl, herself, smiled se
renely.
"It was the first time the Govern
ment has ever issued a permit to a
woman to sail with troops, isn't it?"
"I think it is. I know no woman
ever did it before. General Merriam
wouldn't hear of it when I got to San
Francisco. He wouldn't recognize the
letter I brought. "I am sorry,' he said,
'but it will be impossible to let you go
on the ship unless I receive a formal
order from the War Department. Major
Nickerson wired to Washington at
once, but there was so little time and
I was afraid of some delay. No one
quite understood it. I was ordered
ashore with other visitors the day the
ship sailed and nearly put off when I
refused to go. And ever ao many of..â¢the soldiers spoke to me and asked me
if I. knew thai all the otrer ladies were
ioU'the ship. They were all so sort of
|-r incredulous.
" : :'le; was awfully funny. There was a
. ftiati:out on one of the tugs taking/pic
â  tures of, the ship and I was leaning
i.'v. i- the rail looking bade as we put out
â¢'toward the heads. Tie bay was so
â¢ beautiful and bo gay with all the Hags
: and the cheering and the bands play
â¢ Ins and the handkerchiefs waving, and
.. with) all l have read about how the
â â â¢. transports have left San Francisco, I
.never imagined it quite as I saw it that
day.,- and to be a part of it made it
setting. The tui was alongside the
ship, and this man who had been tak
. ing. .pictures suddenly discerned me.
..-.His-- expression was the funniest thing
- I ever saw. It darned on him that a
woman was going out on the transport
â¢ and that he hadn't known it, "and that
â¢â¢.he ought to get a picture of her and,
. oh! a lot of things occurred to him all
â¢af once. He mad? a scramble for the
hurricane deck and by this time we
wore going pretty fast and the tug was
â¢ pitching along catching the swell and
he was drenched. Of course, I stepped
-Out of range and he waved madly at me
'â ":.tp come back. We could see he was
. shouting, but we couldn't hear in that
â¢ wind, and he stood there gesticulating
â¢and dripping, and the major said,
'You'd better let him get a picture be
.fore he's drowned,' so 1 went back to
. the. rail. He looked so relieved. That
. was. the last face we saw until we
â  reached Honolulu. We did not pass a
â¢ sail.- It was a perfectly eventless trip â
â¢â except for the novelty of my position.
â  /.You know it was a strange feeling to
â¢ be out on the ocean, far from even the
sight of land, one woman among all
â¢â  those, men. I couldn't help feeling
queer and conscious. And you've no
â : idea â or at least I had not until I saw
â¢ ...them all togetherâ how many men SOO
â¢ .men are."
.â¢ Mrs. Nickerson laughed. "I mean
. they took such a lot. I used to long
. '.for a woman's face among them. They
â¢ 'seemed to be perishing of curiosity
.'concerning me, too. i kept in my cabin
'. when I wasn't on the hurricane deck
â¢ and the. men used to dawdle by with
. . one- eye turn- 1 in, and whenever I
â  passed along the deck they'd stop talk
.. ing and stare and then whisper and
" look embarrassed and worried if I hap
: peried to glance their way. I suppose
â¢ I seemed as queer to them as I felt. If
.-.there had been three or four others it
â  would have been different. I felt hor
â¢ ribfy in the way, too. I kept hearing
thinks .they said among themselves
'You. know you hear everything on !
â¢ board ship that was never intended for ,
â¢' my, ears, and I often happened inno
. cently around when I wasn't expected,
..find- brie day I created a frightful com
.. motion by coming out of my cabin just
â¢as the men were being marched along
-â  to their bath. The major warned me
â¢/back in time, but the men heard the
. door open or saw a flutter of skirts
â -. ; ,d they broke ranks and rushed for
â .cover, and there was a great flurry on
- .deck.. I had to get out of my cabin
'â '.â¢anil .the men had to get their baths, so
: they all hid behind some canvas while
...'I r:'in for the hurricane deck. It was :
â.the most absurd performance. After
..-that- their bath hour was changed to
. five o'clock in the morning, and as they
. washed decks at three you can iraag
. Ine!"
."Then it wasn't all romance and ex
â . 'citoment and gay devotion as the girls
â  In Washington thought it would be?"
-. â  "I'm an old married woman," said
.Mrs". Nickerson.
â ' "What did you do for distraction?"
.â¢:'â¢: ''Oh, the usual thing one does on
steamers â lounged, read, talked, looked
at living- fish, played with a fox ter
' .fier â oh. yes: and we had an educated
â¢ groat who f-ould tell an officer from a
private and got up on his hind legs
â¢ to salute Colonel Barber â least that's
â¢ .the soldiers' story. Then the men had
mandolins and guitars and banjos and
' -sang for us on deck nearly every night.
THe officers were all perfectly charm
ing. ".They did everything to make the
trip "'agreeable. But you know men in
â¢ their hearts think a, woman Is a sort j
of -nuisanceâ tT7at^*?_one woman in a 1
crowd of men â no matter how gallant
â¢ they, are.- They feel the restraint, I
Know'! I've had brothers and I've ,
heard their views. I put my steamer
chair off at a discreet distance, and had
; the major arrange for a little separate
.'â  table, and altogether I spared their ;
â¢ feelings as much, as I could."
' * ; I'm sure with that amount of tact
woman on a troop ship ought to be a
bl ess-ing.**;
'"She wouldn't want to be," Mrs.
"Nicki Idedly. "There 'are other
a Infinitely more comfortable that
she can bless. It was fun in a way,
yon know, to be the first woman to
have the Experience and all that,
but," â she hesitated, expressively.
"But?"
"Well," she aaW, laughing, "I've had
it â and I'm satisfied."

NO POMP ATTENDS
THE WEDDING OF
THE REPUBLICS
Ceremonies Brief and Simple,
Concluding With a Salute
to Old Glory.
Bugles Sound "Taps" Over the Symbolic
Grave of Hawaii's Defunct
Nationality.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
DEPARTMENT OF FOItEIGN AFFAIRS,
HONOLULU, H. 1., August 8, 1898.
Sir: I have the honor to inform you that the ceremony attend
ing the transfer of the sovereignty of the republic of Hawaii to the
United States will take place at noon on Friday, August 12, and
thereupon the powers of the Minister of Foreign Affairs will cease
so far as they relate to the conduct of diplomatic intercourse be
tween Hawaii and foreign states.
The existing customs relations of Hawaii with the United States
and other countries are to remain unchanged until the Congress of
the United States shall have extended the custbms laws, of the Unit
ed States to this country. For this reason Hawaiian Consuls abroad
will continue in the exercise of their official duties. I have the honor
to be, sir, your most obedient servant,
HENRY E. COOPER, Minister of Foreign Affairs.
HONOLULU, Aug. 11.â The foregoing
is the formal notification addressed to
the diplomatic and consular corps in
forming: the representatives of foreign
powers of the demise of the Republic
of Hawaii and of the absorption of its
sovereign independence by the United
States of America.
The ceremonies attending the trans
fer of the sovereignty will, so far as
theii* official character is concerned, be
brief and simple, and the day would
have passed off almost tamely and
quietly had it not been for the strenu
ous efforts of the jingo annexationists
who have practically carried their way
in regard to a grand popular demon
stration which for enthusiasm is pro
jected to be as historical as the im
portant event it will commemorate. It
is useless to speak in detail of the bit
ter words said and printed before the
people were permitted to have a voice
in the celebration, for clamor has won
a victory after a hard-fought contest
with the federal and local authorities,
and by-?ones may as well be buried
with the wails of the Hawaiian mourn
ers in the promise of the resurrection of
hopeful days. #
In brief, the ceremonies will be im
posing and picturesque. In front of the
executive building (the former palace)
will be erected substantial platforms to
accommodate distinguished guests and
Admiral Miller, Minister Harold M.
Sewall, President Dole and the officials.
The National Guard of Hawaii wili pro
ceed to the water front and thence es
cort the United States troops to the
Government building, where they will
mass right and left with the United
States forces facing the building. The
citizens' guards and mounted reserve,
sharpshooters and other organizations
will take up prominent positions around
them and the grounds will be given up
to the people.
The day has been madi a legal holi
day in order to insure a large attend
ance, but the Hawaiians and their
sympathizers have determined to reli
giously, if unwisely, remain absent, all
efforts, pecuniary or otherwise, to in
duce them to participate having igno
miniously failed.
The Hawaiian flag will be lowered to
the air of the Hawaiian national an
them, "Hawaii Ponoi," played by the
Hawaiian band, a salute will be fired
and the bugles will sound "taps" over
the symbolic grave of Hawaii's defunct
nationality. Minister Sewall will read
the authority conveyed in President
McKinley's instructions to him, the
stars and stripes will be unfurled from
the loftiest tower of the State House
with the strains of the "Star-spangled
Banner," rendered by the band of the
Philadelphia, salutes and the flag rais
ing bugle calls. The populace will then
have an opportunity to vent its enthu
siasm with cheers and patriotic speech
es and songs, in which it probably will
be led by Minister Sewall. President
Dole, Minister Cooper and others.
In the evening some tons of fireworks
will be exploded, and at 9 o'clock there
will be a grand reception, followed by
a ball in the halls of the Legislature.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the
oaths of allegiance to the United States
will be administered to all the officials
and employes, high and minor, civil
and military, by the heads of depart
ment, and notaries public holding Gov
ernment positions.
This forenoon I had the unsatisfac
tory pleasure of again seeking come
definite information in regard to our
future status from President Dole,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Cooper and
United States Minister Sewall. The
first named two were as unpleasantly
secretive as heretofore on the subject,
maintaining that they were under of
ficial and personal pledges to Mr. Se
wall of absolute secrecy, and they
could not even divulge the slightest ap
proach to information.
Mr. Harold M. Kewall was more talk
ative without transgressing the in
structions he was under to preserve si
lence inviolate until he made the of
ficial announcement he was directed to
make on the morrow by President Mc-
Kinles. He knew that the statement
he waF to make was based almost ex
clusively on the form of the Newlands
resolution of annexation and followed
it implicitly so far as the future tem
porary form of government was con
cerned. There were, of course, de
tails to be mentioned, but the purport
and effect of these it would be im
proper for him to disclose. He might
say that all the present officials of the
Hawaiian Government would remain
in office and conduct the affairs of the
Government on its present lines so far
as it was practicable, but he could not
say what the titles of Mr. Dole or the
other officials would be, or whether
their titles would officially correspond
with those of officials of the United
States transacting duties of a similar
nature, nor could he say what would
be the descriptive title of the country
in descriptive, legislative or legal doc
uments. So fur as the American le
gation was concerned, its name and
present duties would end at noon to
morrow. He himself would remain
here to carry <Mt the instructions con
fided to him iy President MeKir.ley.
The name and o*ities attaching to such
a confidential position could not at
present be discl<VHd.
As to the question of d'izenship. all
in the Government employ would have
to take the customary oath of alle
giance to the UnVted States. In re
gard to others, let that be a matter for
\
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 21, Ih9B.
future consideration: in many in
stances there would be knotty ques
tions to be solved. There were certain
fixed principles and laws governing
such transfers of sovereignty, and they
were simple, but as regards such per
sons as were neither American nor Ha
waiian citizens the question of citizen
ship would be one for further instruc
tions. The question of a man who had
been an American citizen, but who was
now a Hawaiian, was placed before
him, and the Minister's personal, not
official, impression was that no oath
was, for the present at least, required.
Knowing that Minister Cooper had
transferred the question of compensa
tion to British and other foreign resi
dents for imprisonment during the 1595
affair to Mr. Sewall. I ventured to ask
him to confirm the fact, which he read
ily did. The papers in the matter have
been forwarded to Washington, where
the representatives of the foreign pow
ers concerned will take up the matter.
The probability is that at a convenient
season the precedent of the Japanese
claims will be followed, and in view of
the amicable relations existing between
the United States and the several coun
tries interested, including Great Brit
ain, Germany, Portugal, Greece, Den
mark and Norway and Sweden, they
will be dealt with according to their
merits. The claims made by American
citizens on the same grounds have been
similarly dealt with.
I am informed by reliable authority
that the discussion of these matters
will lead to unpleasant comments of
diplomatic breach of faith on the part
of the Foreign Office of Hawaii, not a
novel charge by any means. It is also
stated by an eminent financier that the
finances of the Government, when ej
perted, will show an " indebtedness be
yond the $4,000,000 agreed to be paid by
the United States of America of up
ward of $250,000.

J.G. Blame Jr. Misbe
haves in Honolulu.
GROSSLY INSULTED A LADY
HER IRATE HUSBAND GIVES DE
SERVED PUNISHMENT.
The Disgraceful Incident Occurred
at a Swell "Hula" Given at
the Home of a
Native.
HONOLULU, Aug. 11.â The actions of
Captain James G. Blame, who accom
panied one of the recent expeditions
to Manila, while stopping at Honolulu,
have occasioned a great deal of com
ment and much regret is expressed
both by army officers and citizens that
the son of the famous statesman
should so far lose control of himself as
to create a disturbance in a house
where he was a guest.
There are many stories concerning
the riot, the difference in them being
largely due to the fact that every ef
fort was made to suppress the matter,
but it finally leaked out. and the result
is that most of the stories are so wild
as to cause more comment than if the
truth had been openly stated. Some ef
fort was made in fact to induce the
general public to believe that no row
had occurred, but Blame's spoiled face
gave the lie to any such statement.
The story as received from a good
source is as follows: Some of the na
tives In their desire to do everything
for the amusement of their guests ar
ranged for a "hula," a form of diver
sion prohibited by the law. The invi
tation was readily accepted and Blame
was one of the party. In the course of
the evening a few bottles of a native
beverage were produced and as the
bottles became empty the little party
of officers became full. Blame became
particularly hilarious and apparently
got the ida into his head that he owned
the whole of the Hawaiian Islands and
all that breathed therein. He began
casting surreptitious glances at a
buxom Hawaiian woman, and finding
himself unobserved began to display
his feelings more openly and essayed a
few soft embraces for the winning
smiles which were being showered upon
him by the daughter of the sunny isl
ands.
At this point in the proceedings the
husband of the woman became aware
of what was going on and he turned
upon the officer with the fury of a
tiger. He struck the young officer a
blow which stretched him out on the
floor and a fight followed.
The young officer's friends went to
hrs assistance, but the insult of young
Blame to the Hawaiian woman was
too gross for even the peace loving,
good natured natives to overlook, and
the young American guests in whose
honor the entertainment was being
given were thrown out of the residence
and had they not taken to flight and
hid themselves on their transport one
or more of the party might now be oc
cupying graves under the lordly palms
of America's new possessions.

ACHIEVES A VICTORY UNDER
DISADVANTAGES.
Little South-Ender Carried on Stal
wart Soldiers â Alex Pape
Takes the Senior Skiff
Race.
Bpectal Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA, Or., Aug. 20.â The second |
day of the great Astoria regatta opened
to-day with the weather clear and the
atmosphere somewhat warm. Scarce
ly a ripple was perceptible on the race
course, and outside of a strong flood |
tide the conditions were excellent for |
the aquatic contests. It is estimated
that fully 40,000 people witnessed the
different events. The course was lit
erally alive with craft and a grander
regatta scene was never before wit
nessed on this coast.
After preliminary races between In
dian canoes. Chinamen and men-of
war gigs, etc., Alex Pape of the Dol
phin Club, Dr. Dennis of the South i
Ends and Coney Ochs of the Pioneers !
lined up for the senior skiff race. Pape
had the outside position, Ochs the cen- !
ter and Dennis the inside. The latter
course was much the better, as by hug
ging the shore one could dodge the
strong tide. At the report all got away
to an even break, but Pape rowing a
38-to-the-minute stroke, soon took the j
lead, with Ochs right at his stern. Den
nis had planned to row an easy race
to the stakes and with a slow stroke j
he kept about four lengths behind the
leader. The Pioneer and Dolphin men !
were working hard in the row up and ;
at the turn they were around together,
both turning the same buoy. Ochs hit
his outrigger against the stake boat
and lost a little time by his oar flying
out the rowlock. By the time Dr.
Dennis had turned, Pape was nearly
seven lengths ahead of all, with Ochs
second and the South Ender third. The |
latter let himself out in the row home
and soon passed Ochs and cut down !
Pape's lead considerably. The former I
was too fast, however, and crossed the t
line a good four lengths ahead of the
South Ender, with Ochs badly dis
tanced. Time, 13:62.
The greatest event of the day was
the single scull race for the Portland
trophy, valued at $125 and emblematic
of the Pacific Northwest single scull
championship. The entries included
G. J. McCommon and J. Patent of the j
Portland Rowing Club, G. Alexander j
of the Vancouver Boat Club and Frank
Duplissea of the South End Rowing
Club of San Francisco. The northern ,
scullers are the fastest oarsmen in this ;
section, and J. Patent of the Portland
Rowing Club won last year's champion
ship trophy in the singles. Outside of
young McCommon, who is only a little
more than a boy, the San Francisco lad
looked a midget alongside of his large
and muscular opponents. He rowed a
paper shell, which is somewhat slower (
than the cedar boats of his opponents, ;
and sat in it for the first time in his
life during the race. This is a great
disadvantage, as a shell has to be
rigged just to suit the rower or little
speed can be got out of the boat.
Only three of the original entries
lined up, the Vancouver sculler with
drawing at the last moment. This left
Duplissea to row against the two Port
land men. The latter won the toss for
positions and took the outside and in
side course, leaving the middle station
for the California boy. The latter got
the lead, getting off before the pistol
cracked, with McCommon second and â 
Patent third, all well bunched. Half
way to the stake Duplissea and Me- i
Common gained two lengths on the f
last year's champion, and held this to
j the turn. McCommon quit here, and
I Patent made the turn and was after
j the South Ender, rowing a 36 stroke.
; Duplissea's ripht arm hurt him con
! siderably in the race, but he pluckily
! kept on rowing, and finished amid a j
hot finish and terrific uproar two
lengths ahead of the best sculler in the
Northwest. He will bring to San Fran-
Cisco an annual trophy the winning of
which is the pride of every oarsman in j
the north. Time, 13:42 2-5.
Duplissea was carried shoulder high â 
after the race through the streets to
his hotel. He is considered th<* great
est sculler that ever rowed in this sec
tion. His victory is all the more merit
ed from the fact that yesterday was j
the first time he sat in a shell for
a year, while his opponents had been
training for months for the .contest.
After this event the people of Astoria
were anxious to see the Alameda crew
pitted against the Vancouver four, who
defeated the Portland four in the regat
ta yesterday for the championship of j
the Northwest. It was simply an ex- ,
hibition race, and was scheduled to be I
barge against shell. The water was
found too rough for the shell in the af
ternoon, so both crews rowed barges,
the Vancouver four rowing the South
End boat, with George McGrill as
cockswain. The race was a three-quar- ,
ter mile straightaway. The water was j
quite choppy when the crews started, I
and both were well filled before the
finish was reached. The Vancouvers
never rowed a barge before, but were
at home in the boat when they pulled
a few strokes, as their style of rowing
is similar to the barge system. The
Alamedans kept up half a boat's length
lead from the start, and both crews
were rowing beautifully and just tear
ing through the waves, which threat
ened to swamp them at any minute.
Near the finish the South End cockswain
called for a spurt from the Vancouvers,
and quickening their stroke they fairly
led the boat out of the water. Both
\vs crossed the line in a dead heat
c. The Alameda barge swamped
t as the line was passed,
he personnel of the Vancouver four
R. Watts, stroke- T T. O. Alexander,
3; E. Wragg, No. 2; and R. Spinks,
The California oarsmen left Astoria
by to-night's train for their city, and
have nothing but congratulations to
offer the Astorians for the treatment
they received while here.
F. M. Gunn, owner of the Hotel Mur
ray, where the rowers stopped, was
presented with a souvenir by the Call
fornians for his kind treatment.
S. J. Pembroke of San Francisco was
warmly thanked by the rcpatta com
mittee of Astoria for his efforts in
bringing the Californians up here.
Among the San Franciscans at the
regatta were: Miss L. Butz, Miss J. F.
Ward, Mr. and Mrs. Finn, Mrs. Peter
son,, Fred Bailey, J. Hadenfeldt, Syd
Weinsbuok, Sydney Soule and Louis
Miller.
The Astoria regatta committee de
cided to-night that the Alameda crew
outrowed the Vancouver shell crew in
the exhibition race to-day, and have
given them medals bearing the inscrip
tion, "Champion Crew of the Pacific
Coast." Their time was faster in the
barge over a mile and a half course
with a turn than the Vancouver's fours
in a mile and a half straight-away
race.
THE FAVORITES

Long Courses Tested
Dogs of Quality.
THE BETTING WAS LIVELY
GRASSHOPPER EASILY BEAT
CHILI PEPPER.
Contests That Should Attract Large
Crowds of Leashmen to the
Coursing Parks
To-Day.
It has been some time since coursing
enthusiasts witnessed such sport as oc
curred at Union Park yesterday after
noon. With few exceptions, where the
result was never in doubt, the courses
were close and exciting and greatly en
joyed by those who had the good for
tune to be present.
The Bhort-enders did not fare very
well, as it was favorites' day; but a dif
ferent order of affairs may result to-day,
as the crackajacks will meet in the slips,
and winners will not be easy to select.
Sweet Lips did not appear in time to
meet her opponent, and Rich and Artless
had a bye in consequence.
Lissak ran well yesterday and bowled
over the favorite, Magic, rather easily.
Chartist, for some reason, has been run
ning very poorly for several weeks, and
yesterday he did not score a single point
in his race with Glenstone. He should be
granted a leave of absence from the Held
to recuperate, or traineu properly.
Seldome, formerly known as The Turk,
surprised the judges of form by giving
Commodore a good beating. The last
named dog was 2 to 1 favorite. Maud S
ran a sharp and snappy race with Glen
wood, and should give a good account
of herself to-day.
Much interest was manifested in the
race between Grasshopper and Chili Pep
per. The hot stuff dog was made a fa
vorite in the betting, but Grasshopper
was out for glory and defeated his op
ponent rather easily in a long race.
Rosette ran unaided by Rosebud, a
young bitch, who did not attempt to fol
low the hare when slipped. j
Some of the bettors played Daisy Hill, I
a 1 to 10 shot, against Firm Friend, be- j
cause she happened to beat Mialmo last I
Sunday at Intfleside. But Daisy wasn't i
in It from start to finish, still t inn
Friend ran much slower than usual, the
hare escaping. Belle of Seville neatly dis
posed of Wlklflower, although the latter
was a good favorite a>t 2Vs to 1.
Close attention was paid to suspicious i
characters by detectives employed by the
association for the purpose of uneartli
injr. if possible, any attempt that may
have been made by gambling fiends who
have been known to "doctor ' dogs. Some j
of those vandale who are marked as de
stroyers of the *port were conspicuous
by their absence.
As will be seen by a glance at the pro
gramme of to-day, there are several hot
races between high class dogs on the
tapis.
The result of yesterday's coursing is ap
pended:
Open stake, first roundâ Cavalier beat White
Lily; Rich and Artless a bye; Moonlight beat
Correct; Lissak beat Magic; Olenstune beat
Chartist; Mira Monte beat Juliet; Forget beat

Two thousand people went out to Ingle

test coursing ever put on a sward. The â¢
talent got it in the neighborhood of col- |
lars, and had to take it. The running !
â  was confined to the first round of the '
'non-winner stake. The same stake will i
open events to-day, and the champion j
contest will follow.
The work was uneventful. It was a I

SARATOGA RESULTS.
Matanzas Wins the Grand Union Ho-
Tel Stakes.
SARATOGA, N. V., Aug. 20. -The largest at
tendance of the meeting graced the races at
Saratoga to-day. The feature of the day was
the Grand Union Hotel stakes of $4000, which
brought out eight two-year-olds, of which Mat
ansas was the favorite. The start wan a good

SLAVES FROM

Chinese Women Smug
gled Into Town.
SOME WORK FOR OFFICIALS
TWENTY-ONE HUNDRED PAID
BY A SYNDICATE.
Opportunity for the Cninese Bureau
to Make Eight Important
and Well - Guarded
Captures.
The Chinese Bureau is supposed to be
engaged in hunting for nearly two hun
dred Chinese men and women who were
allowed to land at this port recently
for the purpose of proceeding to the ex
position at Omaha, where they were to
take part as '. actors and exhibitors in
the Chinese Village, owned by the Mcc
Lee Village Company. About a week
ago one of them, a chair-mender, was
arrested .in Chinatown for being illegally
in the United States.
Chinese who pretend to be well-inform
ed on the subject say that 200 of the
pretended Omaha exhibitors have left
that place and are now scattered all
over the United States, principally' in
California. They say also that the bond
given to the Secretary of the Treasury
by the Mcc Lee Village Company as a
guarantee that they will return all the
exhibitors to China will not be binding
if that company should fail and the vil
lage shouJJ be attached by the Sheriff,
as was the case with' the Chinese ex
hibit at the Columbian Exposition at
Chicago in 1894.
The same Chinese say that twenty-two
of the women have come to this city
from Omaha, and are now occupants of
disreputable nouses here. Eight of them
! are said to have been located in houses
! occupied by the following Chinese: Kirn
Qu, So Hoo Vow. Chang Won Tuck,
! Leong Sing, Chin Woy and Wong King.
I It is said that they have been offered for
! sale at $2000 each, and that the girl in
Leong Sing's house was bought by a
Chinese syndicate for $2160.
Arrests are expected to be made within
a few days. mmm

PROPOSED MEMORIAL TO THE

Irish Views as to the Benefits of the
House of Lords' Changes in
the Local Government
Bill.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
BpÂ«ciaJ Correspondence of The Call.
DUBLIN, Aug. 6.â Dublin, which has
...been thrown into excitement already
..by the project to elect a Unionist Lord
â Mayor for 1599, is about to be provided
â¢â â With an additional cause for unrest. A
â¢ committee has been formed in London
â  for the purpose of erecting a national
memorial to the late Mr. Gladstone,
'â¢â . a.nd among the suggestions made by
..that body is one for the erection of a
: statue or other monument in Dublin
in honor of the deceased English states-
man. This suggestion, like the proposal
â¢â ; .to pay Mr. Gladstone fun- ral honors,
;. has received the approval of that sec
. lion of Irish Nationalists which took
â ';-'t-he Bide of Mr. Gladstone against Mr.
Fnrnell in the crisis of 1890; whether it
will command the support of the Par
â ;.hfil.lite party, which has been hitherto
. â¢â 'â¢â  in a decided majority in Dublin, re
mains to be seen. The Corporation is
fomeet on Monday to consider the
question, and the organ of the Parnell
lie. party to-day emphatically declares
that it would be an insult to Parnell's
memory and an exaltation of political
siavishness and recreancy "to allow the
erection of a statue to any Englishman
in a place which is yet without a me

â¢morial of any kind of the greatest Irish
.man of the nineteenth century." It is
â  not denied that Mr. Gladstone has
â  some claims on Irish gratitude; but, on
â .â¢the other hand, it Is pointed out that
'â¢. .he was a coercionist before he was a
â  home ruler; that all his good deeds to
.ward Ireland were the result of Irish
'agitation working on a mind given over
..'â '.to. opportunism, and that for that rea-
â  son he is not entitled to any exceptional
../â honors at the hands of the Irish people.
.. .The topic has only been just Introduced,
â .fid. to say, so that it has not yet been
V. .much discussed; but within a few days
;.' jfis certain to become a burning one.
A question lons agitated has this
'Week been settled satisfactorily, not
â¢â¢â¢ only on paper, but in actual fact. For
â¢years past the Irish people, and es
â  peclally the people of Dublin, had been
â â â .â complaining in vain of the slow rate
" at which mails and passengers were
carried by the subsidized mail route
between Dublin and London, of the
high fares, and the inconvenient hours
of arrival and departure. The train
service has been supplied by the Lon
don and Northwestern Railway Com
pany which has a monopoly between
Chester and Holyhead, the port of de
parture for Dublin, while the sea ser
vice is that of the City of Dublin
Steam Packet Company, whose four
mail boats, named after the four prov
inces of Ireland, have been famous for
â¢'.'more than a quarter century. The Eng
lish Railway Company, having a fleet
â  of steamers of its own plying between
Holyhead and the Irish ports on the
opposite side of the channel, and being
desirous of establishing a monopoly in
the channel, too, has divided with the
Postofflce (which of course is managed
entirely in the interest of England)
the responsibility of blockading all at
tempts at reform. By dint of persever
ance, however, and largely through the
efforts of a Parnellite M. P., Patrick
â¢â¢O'Brien, the desired reforms in the
Iri.=h mail service have at length been
effected and on Monday last, the Ist of
'August, they came into a dual opera
â  .tion.
; It is scarcely an exaggeration to say
. that the journey from London to Dub
lin and back haa now been made as
â  cheap and as comfortable as is possi
.. hie at present. But decidedly the
; .. greatest improvement is in the sea
' service. The City of Dublin Company,
it may not be known, is about the old
ies! steamship packet company in the
' world, and for more than sixty years it
' :"has been the principal means of com-
' â  ' munication between England and Ire
.â  land. For at least a quarter of a cen
tury its boats have never had an acci
dent but one, and that one occasioned
â¢ no loss of life. Nov.- its old boatsâ the
Ulster, LeinÃter, Munster and Con
naughtâhave given place to four others
' with the same names, which are a
. model of speed and comfort, not to
say luxury. They perform the journey
.of sixty miles of sea between Holyhead
and Kingstown (County Dublin) in
) about two hours and three-quarters.
American visitors would do well to try
: them.
This is the season of congresses, and
is having its share of them.
: During the past week we have had here
â  the annual convention of the Irish Na
tional Foresters. The society is a mu
tual benefit organization, but it does
.-. not profess to be non-political. The
' very uniform of its membersâ the dress
â¢associated with Robert Emmet, green
double-breasted swallow-tall coat,
white knee-breeches and top boots â is
suggestive; but It Is not the only thing
about the Irish National Foresters
which smacks of Irish nationalism.
No Nationalist demonstration ever
takes place of which a considerable
contingent of that body does not form
a conspicuous element, and in Dublin
they have been largely Parnellite. This
week was the first occasion for four
teen years in which they assembled in
annual general meeting in the Irish
capital, and the fact that, whereas in
isM. when the last convention as
sembled in Dublin they were allowed to
meet and break up without, so to say,
any official public recognition, this
time they had the Lord Mayor presid
ing over their opening meeting, and
the Council Chamber in the Cltv Hall
was placed at their disposal for the
transaction of their business. The gen
eral secretary of the society is Mr.
Joseph Hutchinson, who is a member
of the Dublin Corporation, and his cus
tomary review of the past was a pleas
ant tale of progress. A few of the
figures he gave will suffice to show the
general nature of his statement. In
ISB4, when the last convention was held
in Dublin, the members numbered 35G3,
and the accumulated funds were only
Â£2-100. Now, according to Mr. Hutchin
son. the members number 21,054 and the
accumulated funds amount to Â£34,454.
The total number of benefit members
is 19,43Â»i, and the total amount paid in
benefits during the year was upward
of Â£17.000. This is not a bad record,
especially when it is remembered that
the Irish National Foresters are only
one out of several similar societies in
Ireland which are all thriving.
The local government bill has at last
virtually become law. The House of
Lords made in it only two changes of
any importance. One was the estab
lishment of double member constituen
cies for the rural district councils,
which will have to do with the admin
istration of poor law relief and the
sanitary laws: the other was the In
clusion of Oalway City among the
county boroughs. The former change
was avowedly proposed in the interest
of the disestablished minority, but
what good it will do the landlords it
has puzzled a good many persons to
discover. Among those who are per
plexed on the point is the veteran tem
perance reformer, Sir Wilfrid Lawson,
M. P., who is given to the writing of
poetical squibs while he is sitting in
his place in the House of Commons,
and who perpetrated the following
quatrain as he listened to the Irish
landlord representatives pleading for
the opportunity being given to the Irish
Nationalist electors to choose two
councilors instead of one for the new
rural boards:
I'm In a most terrible state of alarm.
And scarcely know what I'm to do.
One popular member will do me much harm;
The best plan is to let me have two!
Opinion in the Irish ranks was di
vided as to whether the change made
by the House of Lords was desirable,
but the Government used their major
â¢ ity to carry It, and so there are to be
; double membered constituencies for the
': rural councils and single membered for
the county councils which will repre
sent both rural and urban districts in
all more important matters. The pro
posal as to Galway met with a differ
ent fate. It was opposed by the Gov
ernment, and the Speaker ruled it to
be a breach of the privileges of the
House of Commons, inasmuch as it
raised a money question, which that
assembly, according to the constitu
tion, has the exclusive right to raise in
the first instance. The result was that
it was rejected. The practical result
to Galway is that, though it does not
lose pecuniarily, it does lose in position
and prestige. It ceases to be a city, to
have a separate assize and separate
Sheriff, and becomes for county pur
poses a part of the county of Galway.
It is a pity that this should be the fate
of a town which two hundred years
ago was a great emporium of com
merce, having by the way an extensive
and intimate connection with Spain.
But the real truth is that, despite the
unquestioned and unquestionable ad
vantages of its topographical position â j
It ought to be the chief port for Ameri
ca on this side of theAnlantic â it is wo- j
fully declining. Let me hope, as a
Galway man, that it has a better fu
ture in store.
An election has taken place in Eng
land this week which has had consid
erable interest for Ireland and espe
cially for Irish Nationalists. The home
rule member for the English borough
of Grimsby, George Doughty, suddenly
thought it well a few weeks ago to re

cant his opinions on the question of
i home rule, and then went back to his
' constituency for re-election as a Union
ist. It was a plain challenge to the
Liberal party in Grimsby and to the
; Liberal leaders to declare themselves
on the question of home rule for Ire-
I land, but, though the challenge was
plain, the glove was not taken up. The
Liberals, indeed, started a candidate in
opposition, but that candidate ex
pressly declared that he would not
j fight on the home rule question, and
Â« despite that tact Sir William Harcourt,
1 as leader of the party, backed him up
i and called on "all true Liberals" to
rally to his side. Under these circum
stances it would obviously have been
of no advantage whatever to the cause
of home rule if the Liberal had won.
As a matter of fact he was beaten, and
i there is great crowing in the Unionist
1 camp in consequence.
The result is unquestionably a bad
â¢ blow for the cause of home rule in
i England, but it is an equally bad blow
for the Liberal party, who ought by
this time to know that the enly earth
ly chance they have of keeping their
I merr.bers together and of getting back
j to power Is to champion home rule and
j make it once again the chief plank in
I their platform. One thing is certain,
! they never can come into power again,
at least in this generation, without the
aid of the Irish vote, and that vote
will be withheld from them as long as
they ma.ntain their present attitude,
I if the views of a good many Irish Na
tionalists are carried out by their rep
resentativesJntheHnuseof Commons.

Tf-jE DESTRUCTION OF FORESTS.
THE preser%ation of the forests of California is
of such prime importance as to demand public
expression and be formulated into a public
policy. It is customary to put foremost the needs of
mining and some other interests. While mining is
important and deserving intelligent attention, it is
safe to say that the protection of our forests and
iorest lands is the greatest economic question in sight
in this State. It is a permanent interest. The wealth
and influence of the forests are not temporary. In no
part of the world do the pines and other conifers re
produce themselves as rapidly as here. It is shown by
the catalogues of Professor Lemmon that California
has a greater variety of useful cone-bearing trees than
any other part of the world. Nature plants species
and sets her forests where the conditions for their
growth are best, and the great number of conifers
found here is proof that the conditions for their
growth are better than anywhere else. What nature
has lavishly planted man is more lavishly wasting and
destroying.
The forest fires of this dry year are appalling in
their extent and in the waste they have caused. The
timber destroyed equals in value the entire gold out
put of the State. Not only is the standing timber gone
but the young trees coming on are destroyed and the
mountain soil is baked by the flames, killing the seed
that waited for moisture to sprout and grow and re
new the forest crop.
At this moment the mountains are lurid with these
fires from Mount Wilson to Shasta. In both the
Coast Range and the Sierra Nevadas the fires are so
general that the landscape is hidden by smoke, and
its pungent effects are felt by passengers on trains in
the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys.
Timber in the Government parks and reservations
is being destroyed in vast quantities, and the unre
served forest is falling before the flames like stubble.
The State can well afford to spend a million a year to
protect these forests. Some plan should be devised
for summer police in the mountains, and everybody
who enters the forests, camping, hunting, fishing,
prospecting or to cut timber, should be identified and
located. Whoever is caught handling fire carelessly,
leaving campfires to smolder, throwing cigarettes in
the duff or in any way endangering the timber by
carelessness or design should be severely punished.
The man who will draw the statute to protect the
forests and to punish forest arson will be a public
benefactor of the first class.
Heretofore forestry has been considered a fad by
the average citizen. The mill and lumber companies
have had the general idea that forestry is intended to
prevent the use of timber for lumber. These mistakes
need correction. Forestry is as definite an art as
agriculture or horticulture. Like them it is devoted
to the planting, protection and production of a crop,

THE COMING CANDIDATE.
THE work of the fusion convention has brought
into focus a very grave and important public
duty. When such a duty appears it may lay a
peculiar burden upon a political party, but that duty
ceases to be wholly partisan in its character. A party
then, in an exceptional sense, becomes the trustee of
public interests that are not partisan. The Republi
can party is placed to-day in this position of trustee
ship. Tt stands upon ground from which it may ap
peal with confidence to all citizens, and in a cause in
which its success is less a triumph of party than a vic
tory for the wholesome people upon an issue that is
l?xger than any party contention.
The interests of locality and personality fade in the
presence of such a responsibility. Talent and fitness
arc not geographical qualifications. Wherever the
Republican party finds a man fit to lead the battle it
mutt make for the good name and prosperity of the
State he is our standard-bearer. The Call divests it
self of personal preference and even of mere party
spirit in the presence of this issue. The matters in
volved are too serious for consideration within local
lines.
Where the choice of the party falls that is our
choice, whether it wait for demonstration in the State
convention or is indicated before that body meets.
There come in the history of all commonwealths
times when "none are for a party, but all are for the
state," and it is our most solemn conviction that such

The voice of faction is now not nearly a sort of

Personal and geographical issues can wait for a
more convenient season. The welfare of all cannot
wait, but is in issue now.
A CHICAGO PRECEDENT.
A CASE recently heard in one of the Police
Courts of Chicago has attracted a good deal
of attention from the press of that city by rea
son of the novel point involved, and it is worth noting
here, as the judgment given may serve as a precedent
for the settlement of a similar controversy that has
arisen in Sacramento.
The issue is that of the rights of an uninvited guest.
According to the reports that come to us, a certain
Joseph Velsiczki took to himself a bride, and in cele
bration of the occasion gave a feast, to which he in
vited numerous friends. To the banquet uninvited
came Mr. Murphy, who not only partook freely of
the dainty viands and the hedonic swizzle, but insisted
upon kissing the bride. Roused to wrath by the un
invited inebriate the bridegroom seized a large tank
ard of wine, and, after pitching the booze into the
face of the effender, proceeded to jam the tankard
over his head.
Being thus blinded and partially muzzled, Mr. Mur
phy could neither fight nor argue the case, and was
summarily thrown out into the wide, wide world of
Chicago at midnight to save himself or perish. It is
asserted that his muffled roars sounding through the
streets frightened the police, but this was not proved
by the evidence given in court. What was made cer
tain, however, was that Mr. Murphy, after trying
vainly to remove the muzzling tankard with his hands,
did in his desperation butt his head against the curb
stones and lampposts in an effort to break the uten
sil, thereby doing himself great damage.
In the end the strange noises drew the attention of
the police and the unfortunate Mr. Murphy was taken
to the station, where, by the aid of a club, the head
of him was released from the tankard. Mr. Murphy
preferred charges against Mr. Velsiczki, but the court
dismissed them on the ground that while an unin
vited guest at a bridal feast may drink of the wedding
wine he has no right to kiss the bride, and that while
in endeavoring to do so he may get damage, he is not
entitled to damages. Mr. Velsiczki was dismissed and
Mr. Murphy was held for disturbing the peace.
The nuptials of Democracy and Populism at Sac
ramento were attended by Major Harney of this city
and certain other uninvited guests. It is not clear that
they ever showed any desire to kiss the bride, but they
did insist on sharing the swizzle. To them, as to Mr.
Murphy of Chicago, it happened that the swizzle was
thrown in their faces and the Maguire tankard
jammed down over the heads of them, and they them
selves thrown out to rip and roar about the streets
and make the nights of Sacramento hideous with
noise.
Whether Major Harney and his colleagues will suc
ceed in getting rid of the muzzling tankard in time to
make a clear statement of their cause before the cam
paign enters upon its next phase remains to be seen.
In the meantime their muffled roaring will resound
like the warble of the Examiner's siren heard afar off.
Under the judgment given in the Chicago case there
seems no remedy for their wrongs except that of
busting the tankard and setting them free. That
course we advise them to take. They should not have
gone to a wedding that was none of theirs. Having
gone and suffered, the one right thing for them to do
now is to release themselves from the Maguire muzzle
and live better lives hereafter.
0N INVESTIGATION NEEDED.
THE front page cartoon in Harper's Weekly
shows a group of American soldiers stricken
with pestilence, lying uncared for and dying,
while Uncle Sam with horror in his face looks on ap
parently helpless, and Columbia, kneeling among the
dying, lifts to him a warning hand with the stern cry,
"The Government must fix the responsibility or the
country will."
The cartoon in no way exaggerates the indignation
in the Eastern States over the terrible suffering
among the troops of the army at Santiago and the
extraordinary number of deaths that have occurred
among them from disease. On this coast we have not
been affected by these things. Our volunteers have
not been in that pestilential camp. Letters from hus
bands, brothers and sons have not come to our homes
in hundreds telling of the lack of food, medicines and
nurses. In the East it has been different. Through
their boys who marched to the front the people of all
the States beyond the Mississippi have been in close
touch with the Santiago expedition, and the tales of
distress coming from there have filled all that portion
of the Union with intense indignation.
There are differences of opinion as to the person
mainly responsible for the suffering that has prevailed
and the deaths that have occurred from a lack of suffi
cient hospital and medical supplies. It is clear, how
ever, that some one is to blame. When the soldiers
of a nation so rich as this cannot receive all requisites
for their proper care when sick, in a campaign so
near our shores as that in Cuba, something is surely
wrong. Such things cannot be the result of accident
merely.
The legend of Harper's cartoon is right. The Gov
ernment must fix the responsibility or the country
will. As a matter of fact the Eastern press is at this
time busily engaged in trying to fix it. The sub

ject at present is receiving more editorial attention
than politics itself. Up to this time opinion is divided
as to the guilty party. Some blame the War De
partment, some the medical staff and some General
Shafter. It is clearly a matter that demands investi
gation in order that the innocent may not suffer
along with the guilty.
In the face of the popular demand for a searching
inquiry into the matter it is not likely that Congress
will delay in appointing an investigating committee
as soon as it assembles. In the meantime popular
judgment against any man or set of men should be
withheld. Eastern papers which are now attempting
to fasten the blame upon some particular person be
fore an impartial investigation has been made are
pursuing methods more sensational than just. Some
of them indeed are so bitter in their attacks upon the
Secretary of War as to lead to the conclusion that
they are more eager to make campaign capital
against the administration than to find out the truth.
It is indeed regrettable that the record of the war
so glorious in every other respect has been stained by
this blot. The evil has come, however, and the best
thing we can do now is to find out the cause of it so
as to be able to guard against similar occurrences in
such wars as may happen in the future. For that rea
son an investigation is imperative. Congress must
fix the responsibility or share it.
WHEN the war between the United States and
Spain broke out Don Carlos is reported to
have declared his followers and himself would
sustain the Spanish Government in its fight; but
that if the Government consented to surrender a por
tion of the Spanish domain in any part of the world
he would at once assert his claim to the crown and
enter Spain at the head of an army for the purpose of
overthrowing the Government that had been found
incapable of maintaining the empire.
The war has been fought out and the Spanish Gov
ernment has surrendered all her islands in this hemis
phere, and virtually surrendered the Philippines. Don
Carlos, however, has not yet started on his march to
overthrow the Government. He has not even ap
peared on the Spanish frontier with a sword in one
hand and a manifesto in the other. Don Carlos, in
fact, seems to have collapsed as completely as any
other Spaniard.
It is gratifying that the Carlist insurrection which
threatened Spain has not occurred and that circum
stances tend to the conclusion that there will be no
serious civil outbreak in the kingdom of any kind.
There is no reason why there should be. All Spain
is responsible for the war. All Spaniards approved it.
Nearly all of them have suffered more or less from it.
All o! them have recognized the need of making
peace in order to avoid greater suffering that would
surely follow a continuance of hostilities. All of
them, therefore, should be willing to share the re
sponsibility of the surrender and make the best they
can of the situation.
The work of redeeming the past is not going to be
an easy task for the Spanish people, but if they will
let insurrections and civil disturbances alone they can
accomplish much, though, of course, their wide colo
nial empire is gone forever. They have, however, a
country rich in natural resources, capable of support
ing three or four times the present population and
possessed of a history whose records of accomplish
ment in art, literature and exploration are calculated
to arouse the highest faculties in the minds of the ris
ing generation. If they turn to these better things
and put away the old corruptions and tyrannies that
have degraded them, there is no reason why they
should not revive the ancient glory of their race and
become once more helpful to the world, instead of
being a cause of strife and war.
To start the Spanish people upon such an upward
course will tax the sagacity of her ablest statesmen
and the devotion of her truest patriots. She hap used
her colonies as sheep to be shorn when she needed or
wished the wealth she couM wring from them. Now
she must rely upon her own wealth. Upon her people
must rest the whole burden of taxation to maintain
the Government. There are no longer any lucrative
colonial offices to be distributed as the spoils of poli
tics. Economy must be practiced, and the practice
will come hard at first. There will be discontent,
which will prompt a Carlist insurrection. If that
should come to pass and the insurrection prove suc
cessful, perhaps the last chance for a revival of the
race would be lost and Spain would take her place ir
redeemably among what Lord Salisbury called the
"dying nations."
MORE fIBOUT THE CUBANS.
AS peace dawns the difficulties of oar situation
in regard to Cuba multiply.
This country must fall squarely back upon
the President's original ground, upon which he de
sired to receive the right of intervention to secure that
stability of government in Cuba which Spain had
failed to bring about.
Let it be repeated, often, that the yellow journals
wanted recognition of the Cuban insurgent govern
ment, which the President declined to give.
The world is in possession of evidence no r that the
insurgents were a small, lawless and disorderly ele
ment, which Spain in her decay and self-deception
and corruption was incapable of controlling. Let it
be understood that we did not make war for these de
generates, but in behalf of the civilized people of the
island who were suffering because Spain could no
longer protect their personal and property rights.
Abundant testimony has been printed to prove that
the first duty of the United States in Cuba will be to
do what Spain failed to do â protect the people against
the insurgents, and, if necessary, wipe the latter off
the face of the earth.
Major General Young, who commanded the Sec
ond Brigade in General Wheeler's division, adds his
statement to that of Fitzhugh Lee and all otherhonest
observers in Cuba. General Young is a native of
Pennsylvania and a regular army officer. He says:
"As far as my personal observation goes tlje insur
gents are a lot of degenerates, absolutely devoid of
honor or gratitude. They are no more capable of
self-government than the savages of Africa. They are
a mixture of the negro, Spanish, Italian and Indian,
and inherit only the bad qualities of each. The United
States cannot afford to turn Cuba over to them.
They would loot everything in sight and then turn in
and rob each other. Most of the leaders of the so
called Cuban army are adventurers, ready to sacrifice
everything and everybody to further their personal
ends. It is my opinion that few of them would hesi
tate to sell out to the Spaniards if fully convinced
that the United States will not deliver the island over
to them. We should never turn that beautiful and
rich island over to a lot of degenerates, who are not
capable of self-government."
If we were fighting for such a gang as is described
by General Young and others, who met the insur
gents face to face and not in the yellow journals,
Congressional speeches and pictorial magazines, we
were guilty of a farce and a folly. The only justifica
tion for the war is that we had to protect the rights
of man against these very insurgents because Spain
had failed in her daty. j
THE CRISIS IN SPAIN.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
After having attended a political con
vention lasting three days and far into
three nights it is difficult to come to
the consideration of anything else. I
have still ringing in my ears the en
comiums showered upon hopeful aspir
ants for office, who, being merely hu
man, did not deserve the praise they
got. I retain vivid recollections of
trickery exposed, of ambitions crushed,
of promises made in secret to be broken
in public. Men called each other liars
and had no trouble in establishing the
allegations. Honors thus being easy
such episodes closed at once. The con
vention did not develop one person of
extraordinary talent. Nobody rose
above the commonplace. There was
not a single masterful speech, although
that of Mayor Phelan was a good one,
the effect largely spoiled by undigni
fied action while Mr. Phelan was try
ing to help the Examiner nominate
Coffey. However excellent a jurist
Judge Coffey may be, and however
strong the faith in his integrity, the
handicap of yellow journalism's sup
port was too much for him. As though
this had not been too great a weight
the Los Angeles delegation must throw
its 81 votes to Coffey. Whatever that
delegation did was certain to excite
the antagonism of all other delega
tions. Thus its friendship was fatal.
To say a word concerning the Los
Angeles delegation fell to my lot dur
ing the week. I never saw a parcel
of men so effective in a negative way.
They came with arrogant demands for
everything; they went home beaten
and humiliated, after having richly
earned the experience. There were
two or three able men In the crowd,
but the rest were puppets, bound,
gagged and not daring to so much as
wipe the perspiration from their brows
without having solemnly caucused and
obtained the permission of Patton. I
do not understand how Patton or any
body else can dominate a free-born
American citizen in this fashion. To
me it is the strange feature of politics,
a profession into which I have dipped
only deep enough to see the corruption,
the insincerity, the open, palpable, un
blushing and generally unpunished
fraud. Men honest in their usual walk
in life leave their characters behind
them when they go into politics. I
would not take the word of a profes
sional politician on a matter relating
to politics, though he made oath to it,
swearing until black in the face by the
ashes of his grandmother. The up
right citizen, drifting casually toward
politics, finds what awaits him, and
either gets out or becomes a chronic,
living by his unholy wits. The indi
vidual who has no connection with
conventions more than to vote at a pri
mary, when the boss consents to the
holding of a primary, has no more to
say about who shall be nominated at
a. convention than he has about the
course of the planets or the tempera
ture of hades. Tha good citizen, elected
to office and remaining a good citizen,
is a happy accident. I wish he would
happen oftener.

Governor Budd seems to me an Ideal
chairman. He exercises complete con
trol, has a pleasing wit which acts as
oil on stormy billows, and while he oc
casionally violates parliamentary
usages, does it with so good a purpose
that instead of resulting in confusion
it allays tumult and dissipates chaos.
When he was succeeded by Cassin, the
contrast was painful. Cassin may
have ability in certain directions. I
think possibly he might plow corn. As
a chairman he is a complete, abject
and almost laughable failure. But a
sense of pity generally checked the hi
larious.
Of course, the convention has been
described in detail, and I only touch
now upoit some salient features of It.
The lack of enthusiasm was not
strange, but the lack of patriotism
was. The common emotion seemed to
be a concentrated greed for office. Na
tional airs excited no response until
some of us called attention to the fact
that such airs ought to be recognized,
and then the response was perfunctory
and inadequate. I have no doubt the
Republican convention this week will
take a lesson from this circumstance.
To sit under a canopy of flags and lis
ten to the "Star Spangled Banner"
without manifesting appreciation does
not seem to me either good American
ism or good Democracy.
Not enough has been said about the
gracious hospitality of Sacramento to
ward the two conventions. The man
ner in which the Pavilion had been
prepared bespoke a disregard of ex
pense, and the effect is highly artistic.
Even the weather has thus far been
kind, for while it has been warm it has
not been oppressive, although far dif
ferent from the sort prevailing in San
Francisco. One feature of the capital
city which strikes a summer visitor
from the metropolis is the beauty of
the girls as accentuated by the cos
tumes the state of the thermometer
permits them to wear. There are no
heavy wraps, no capes nor boas. (I
believe the arrangement San Fran
cisco ladies muffle their necks with in
the evening is a boa.) Instead, there
are lawns and muslins and laces
through which arms show, as beseems
the genuine summer girl. My only ex
cuse for ringing this in here is that
these summer girls constituted by far
the finest feature of the decorations
which lent charm to the Pavilion.
The convention this week will be on
a different scale. The men to receive
nominations will have a right to sup
pose that they will be elected and not
be obliged to carry on a fight with no
other reward than a consciousness that
to get licked Is sometimes a political
duty, from which the partisan patriot
must not shrink. I have a belief that
the Republicans will have no grreat
difficulty in winning as to everything
but the Governor, and that by naming
a good man from San Francisco, whose
record is clean, who is new to the ac
tivities of a campaign, they will elect
the head of the ticket. But, as I
noticed The Call saying a few days
ago, a campaign of apology would be
ruinous to the prospect of Republican
success.

One of the interesting pretenses of
the Democratic situation is fusion. I
observed that the delegates were dis
gusted at the idea and heard them roar
that they would never submit. But
they went through the form of sub
mitting. They did not do it heartily,
as those to whom sober second thought
had brought new light, but in the sul
len manner of men whipped into line.
Probably few of the delegates, when
they vote next November, will vote for
the Populist candidate for Lieutenant
Governor. They will at least go so
far as to scratch him, whether or not
they vote for some other man. They

But while there were no speeches of
note there were many which made the
sparks fly. The fights lent spirit to
an occasion which otherwise would
have been listless as stickless lemonade
and no ice. McNab was variously
called a liar, Braunhart wasn't called
much else, except to order. Dwyer,
Foote, Tarpey and Harney had war
paint on. The Los Angeles delegation
wrangled as to where they should be
stow their fatal favor. Addresses
fairly gleamed blue flame, but none of
the lot delivered was on broad lines
nor devoted to a nobler purpose than
that of throwing somebody down. It
was a greedy convention, all hungry
and few bones in sight. In the contest
between the two sets of San Francisco
patriots of course a decision was neces
sary. The one given did not accord
with my idea of justice. I would have
bounced both delegations.
The fight for Judge Coffey was pe
culiar, being a deliberate attempt to
job the country delegations. It was
instigated by the purists, of whom Mc-
Nab is a sample. It is a pity that Cof
fey's name was used, for it got among
bad associations. The Examiner made a
frantic effort on behalf of the unlucky
candidate, and so he died. But all the
world is not following, with bated
breath, the course of politics.
Another of the anonymous has sent
me a letter. I regret to note that it
was not written by a gentleman who
inadvertently neglected to sign it, but
by a foul and foolish blackguard, a
slinking ruffian, that combination of
coward and bully so irritating to the
sense of decency. I would not waste
time to answer it, yet mention the
matter to show that the document was
received.

During the recent spell of very warm
weather a member of the editorial staff
of the Railroad Gazette had an opnortu
nity to see the effect on track of the ex
pansion of rails under heat. The train
In which he was traveling was stopped
because about 60 feet of track had been
thrown some eleven Inches out of lino.
The gauge was not much disturbed, but
both rails and the ties were swung out.
\ve are told that on a neighboring rail
road somewhat similar conditions were
found in at least five different places.

Gayety and Color at the Inauguration of the Celtic Union's Irish
Fair at Mechanics' Pavilion,
In the Celtic tongue. "Cead maille
faltha,:' which being translated means
"a hundred thousand welcomes, was
the' sentiment that was upon every
tongue at the Inauguration of the
great Irish exposition at Mechanics
Pavilion last night. Seldom has so
brilliant an assemblage been gathered
within the big building.
There was light and color and gay
cty wherever the eyes wandered, and
all connected with the groat undertak
ing were being congratulated on every
side for the successful opening and the
promise it gave of greater success still
in store. The object of the promoters
of the fair i- the erection of a splendid
building under the roof of which may
be gathered ail the Celtic societies in
this city.
The spectators filled even' aisle and
all the space on the floor, making loco
motion a matter of extreme difficulty.
This, spoiled in a degrt-e the effect of
the grand march headed by Uncle Sam
and the Maid of Erin appropriately
garbed. In the march were all the
ladles Identified with the various
booths. The majority were In white or
light colors, and presented a pictur
esque appearance under the calcium
lights. The ladies of the Japanese tea
garden were clothed in the most
"Jappy. Jap. Jappy" of Oriental cos
tumes.
At the conclusion of the march the
.fair was formally opened by Uncle
Sam, Impersonated by R. E. Lynch,
who handed to ftfata of Erin the
golden key of the country. He said:
.Fair Maid of Erin: It Is my pleasant
duty to present to you In behalf pf my
seventy million subjects and of the three
new stars which I have added to my starry
banner,- the golden key of my country, em
blematic of our wealth and prosperity and
Of my favorite State, California. I place
It In your fair hands confident that no one
Will cherish it more highly.
.' Maid of Erin, in the person of Mrs.
F. E. Dunn, responded, saying:
Proudly I accept the key which you have
offered. Cheerfully would I bear It with
me across the seas, because It stands for
that freedom which every Irishman so
ardently desires. When once a*ain I land
on Ireland's shores, the knowledge that I
have held the key of Liberty in my hands;
that I was Joyfully received by a free peo

James R. Kelly, chairman of the
honorary advisory board of the fair,
spoke' in part as follows:
"It Is gratifying to the friends of
the Celtic Union to see this vast as
semblage and the interest it has man
ifested In the noble work for which
this fair was arranged. It is pleas
ing to the men who are working so un
selfishly to note this appreciation. It
shows that the people of dear old
California are ever ready to assist in
all good works."
The desire of the Celtic Union, com
posed of many Irish societies, to build
a hall is a laudable one, and will do
much to bring the Irish people of this
city into closer relationship
Mayor Phelan was the next speak
er, and his address was pitched in a
happy key. He eulogized the Irish
race and its patriots who have fought
on so many fields in this as well as in
their own distressed country. He re
minded those present that this was
the one hundredth anniversary of the
Irish Rebellion, and that It was the
duty of Irishmen to revere and honor
the memory thereof even in this re-
Senator White and Chief Justice W.
H Hatty spoke in the same strain,
and gave way to J. J. Dwyer. He
said:
This Is not the time, nor are the condi
tions suitable, to make an extended speech.
Nevertheless, It Is the time and the condi
tions demand that we of Irish blood, upon
the opening of this novel and prand exhi
bition, should give public expression to some
of the feelinps and ideas which possess us
at this glorious period of our country's his
tory. The war with Ppain Is over. The
dark clouds which enveloped our land and
broupht desolation to the hearthstone of so
many of our homes have rolled by and a
generous and pelf-reliant people once more
bask in the glorious sun of victory and
peace.
It Is Indeed a victory, unparalleled, un
stained by dishonor, unmarked by excesses
or Inhumanities. American institutions have
. come forth from the ordeal of fire stronger
than ever..

Henry R. Levy, one of San Bernar
dino's leading business men, arrived in
town yesterday on his semi-annual visit.
Superior Judge Fletcher A. Cutler of
Del Norte County, one of the lending
spirits at the last Demooraic convention.
Is a guest at the Baldwin, and yester
day n.fterrJoon, after attending 1 to consid
erable business about town, feeling a lit
tle fatigued, he decided to retire to his
room for an afternoon nap. He was
walking out Market street, and, in some
unaccountable way, he got the entrances
of the hotel and the theater mixed up,
and entering the playhouse he soon found
himsc-lf trr-ading the intricate paths of
the orchestra and dress circle, finally
reaching the stage.
It must be known that the theater,
as well as the hotel, have been turned
over to the enrpenter and the painter
for extensive alterations-, but this very
fart only added to the confusion of the
judicial mind, for Judge Cutler had al
ready been made familiar with scaffold
ings, paint pots and other paraphernalia
necessary to renovation by having often
come into contact with them in the hotel.
Therefore when he found himself on the
stage of the theater he addressed him
self to one of the workmen and said
somewhat impatiently, "Where Is that
infernal elevator in this hotel. I have
been looking for it for ten minutes, but
everything is so topsy turvy I cannot
find it. I'll be blessed If I walk up five
flights of stairs, c-ither."
By this time Manager Frledlander, who
was inspecting the improvements, notic
ing the actions of the Judge and over
hearing hIH remarks, said to him, "I beg
your pardon, my friend, but you are not
in the hotel."
"Not in the hotel," said the Judge.
"Well, where am I, then?"
'â¢You are on the stage of the Baldwin
Theater," said Frledlander.
The Judge looked aghast at his inform
ant and said in his most tragic manner:
â¢'"Well. I must say that this is my first
appearance on any stage. I can now
tell my political friends that I have
made my profeesional debut. But I see
so little enthusiasm displayed that I
think I had better make my exit," which
the Judge did forthwith.

auspicious opening of the Irish fair. The
glories of war must be rivaled by the vic
tories of peace, and in every field of human
endeavor, in art, in science. In industry
and invention, may we continue with cour
age and energy to show to the world that
despite seven centuries of tyranny and op
pression, of enforced ignorance and planned
degradation, there ts still left In the Irish
character those qualities of manhood which
nre proof alike against famine and gibbet,
atrainst ridicule and prejudice, and which
happily now are finding in this our beloved
country the opportunity to unite with our
fellow citizens in building up the prand
fabric of American civilization and the glor
ious figure of Americun citizenship.
The addresses were followed by the
grand chorus under J. W. McKenzie.
The singers rendered "The Star-Span
gled Banner," "Columbia." and Kll
larney" In a pleasing manner. The mu
sic throughout the evening, under the
direction of Bandmaster George Ben
nett, was all that could be desired.
The programme was both well chosen
and well rendered.
The American booth, which occupies
the place of honor on the main floor, is
Classic in its simplicity. It is a repro
ductlon of the Capitol dome at Wash
ington and is the design of Frank T.
Shea. To the natural attractiveness of
the booth is added the beauty of the
young ladieÃ of the Knights of St.
Tatrick. so that it Is little wonder that
it was (it all times surrounded by an
eager throng of spectators. The booth
is decorated with thousands of vari
colored electric lichts and at the top
the stars and stripes float proudly to
the breeze. The ynunp ladies of the
booth are all gowned in snowy white
duck relieved at the throat and waist
with silken American colors. Mayor
Phelan has presented a silk flap, for
which votes are being received. The
competition is open to all societies, Ir
respective of Irish affiliations.
Blarney Castle attracted universal
attention owinp to the efforts to kiss
the farfamed Blarney stone. To ac
complish this a person had to be heid
by the body and suspended head down
ward from a narrow window. The
struggles of the worshipers at the
shrine >>f Blarney amused the specta
tors immensely.
All the booths are attractive and the
fair is an assured success. It will be
closed to-day.

Tho British steamer Glenfarg. under |
charter to the Pacific Mail Steamship |
Company, arrived from Hongkong: via '.
Yokohama ami Honolulu yesterday. She j
was off the heads Friday night and an
chored inside th>' lightship until daybreak.
The Glenfarg left Honolulu on the 11th
inst. at 5:30 p. m., and the next day at
noon the stars and stripes were to be
raised. Great preparations had been made
for the event and the town was on tha
tiptoe of expectation when the steamer j
sailed. I
The Glenfarg brought up a batch of
warrants for the arrest of deserters from |
the army. It appears that a great num- j
ber of the volunteers ran away in Hono- i
lulu and are making their way back to |
the coast on sailing vessels. Every BUgar
boat now on the way is said to have one |
or more deserters aboard, and the war- j
rants will be served as soon as the the !
fleet reaches port. The barkentlne <". 1).
Bryant, which left Honolulu on the 9th j
inst., is said to have two deserters aboard
and they will be arrested as soon as the
vessel drops anchor.
Just before the Glenfarg reached Ha
waii the American schooner Brie, from
Puget Sound for China with a load of
lumber, anchored off Honolulu. Captain
Charles Roos was very sick and wa.s
landed, after which the schooner pro
ceeded on her voyage.
The Glenfarg brought the following
cabin passengers: Pierce Dumarpat, Lieu
tenant B. Cedic, W. C, Becker, George ;
Becker and M. Sarachieff. In the steer- j
age there were four soldiers, two of i
whom are "time expired men," and the i
others were invalided home-.
The Glenfarg is to be followed by the |
Glengyle and the Glenshiel. The latter is
known here, having made a voyage under
charter to the Occidental and Oriental ;
Steamship Company. The Qlenfarg is th-Â»
Unest class of "tramp" that has ever i
come to San Francisco. All the material
used In her construction is of the very i
best, so while she was only built for "a
ten-knot ship" she averaged eleven knots
all the way from Hongkong to San Fran
dSCO. Her cabin accommodation is small
but very comfortable while her carrying
capacity ts large. The <;ien line will only ,
run until the Government turns the trans
ports back to the Mail Company.
The soldiers went aboard the troopship I
Arizona yesterday afternoon, but it was !
| this morning before the steamer went into ;
! the stream. She bad to move at the top ;
!of high water because of her great 'â 
I draught, and even then she had som-* I
trouble getting away from the wharf, i
The Arizona ts thp largest transport that |
has so far tnken troops aboard, and she |
is to be taken out by the youngest pilot i
in the port. Captain Fred Mathloson is a !
native son. and besides being a clever

i ami its approaches. No better master
I could be got f<Â«r piloting the big troop
ship into deep water.
The transport Humboldt got away for
St. Michael at 3:30 p. m. yesterday. Short- j
j ly before noon the soldiers were all paid, ,
, and Sergeant Tom Mahoney had to send
! for another detail of officers In order
to keep the men on the steamer. That !
i money was burning a hole In their pock- i
ets. and they wanted to spend some of '
it in. the worst way. In spite of the vigi
lance of their guards some of the sol
i dler? got away, and inside of thirty mm- ,
uf-s were extraordinarily happy. The I

THIRD DISTRICT SOLIDLY
OPPOSITION
DID NOT
DEVELOP
The Man Who Downed
Rilborn Had Every
thing His Own
Way.
McKINLEY WAS CHEERED
The Surprise of This Congressional
ConVention Was That the Sup
posedly Dissenting Counties
Were All for Harmony.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. OAKLAND.
Aug. 20.â The Republican party of Ala
meda County and of the six other coun
ties of the Third Congressional District
are united.
There is but one sentiment and one de
termination existing at this time. This
was most conclusively proved at the con
vention held in Germania Hall to-day.
Not a' word was said and not a sugges
tion offered but what tended to
strengthen the bond of haramony and to
unite closer than ever the Republican
forces for the coming campaign. Ala
meda was a unit. Although four of the
delegates from one of her districts were
not upon the primary ticket of the man
who was nominated to represent the dis
trict in the next Congress, the vote was
unanimous. Solano, which sent a dele
gation which was mainly favorable to
the gentleman whose name was not even
whispered during to-day's proceedings,
willingly and enthusiastically joined in
the procession. Tolo, Colusa, Glenn and
Lake' forget all past dissensions and
adde<i their votes to those of the county
â ting the name of Victor H. Met
calf.
The convention was a fitting opening
to a campaign that will undoubtedly end
in complete Republican success. As an
omen of what is to follow, it could not
nt a brighter example. No one
cm me to differ; all came to further har
mony. If the remaining counties of Cali
fornia are of the sp.me mind as the seven
represented ft>-flay, the fusion ticket
must perforce die an unwilling death next
November.
During the past week many reports
have been received !n Oaklad regarding
factional differences in some of the coun
ties in the Third District. If such ever
existed they have vanished. Certainly,
regarding Alamoda. there was nothing to
indicate that for three months the follow
era of friendly rivals had been organiz
ing and campaigning- and doing every
thing possible to further the interests of
their respective candidates. Among the
men who clapped hardest and shouted
I when the name of Metcalf waa
nted to the convention were those
who four flays ago were doing everything
possible to cause the re-election of Mr.
] Hlhorn. In reality the prevailing senti
ment in favor of harmony and aggres-
Bivenesa was a more important feature
of the convention than the actual work
fur which it had been called together.
No delegate had half the convention
in his pocket, for proxies were very
Bcaraji, nearly every county being repre
.l in full by its entire delegation.
This is more unusual when it is consid
ered that the proceedings could not pos
produce a contest, as only one name
(pas to be presented, and the convention
was to be unanimous in nominating him.
Some of the delegates undoubtedly came
from their counties partly for the purpose
of sizing un Alameda's position in the gu
bernatorial contest, but undoubtedly the
main reason for such a larsp personal at
tendance is found in the fact that every
one reklifces this to be a Republican year,
and ;tll arc anxious to bp abla to say later
on that they participate in the skirmish
ing that led to victory.
Not for many years has such an Influ
ential representation of Alameda Repub
licanism been seen at a convention. Not
only among the delegates but among the
large crowd <>n the floor were solid men
who rai'ly have their names mentioned
::i oonneoUon with politics, The element
th.it generally dominates petty politics
was conspicuous mainly by its absence.
A. couple of the Fourth Ward reprobates
could' be seen in the gallery, but they
were practically ostracized by the rest
.if the crowd, and certainly had no place
in that gathering.
The spirit of the convention Is, per
haps.' best told by the nature and grad
ual progression of the cheering and en
thusiasm with which it received the va
rious allusions to people and events that
were referred to on the platform.
When Judge Nusbaumer presented the
name of Victor H. Metcalf, a genuine
svhole-souled cheer came from delegates
and lobby alike, being re-echoed by the
crowd in the rallery.
A little later some speaker, In the course
of his remarks, mentioned the name of
William McKlnley. Instantly there was
i, roar of approbation and all kinds of ap
plause from every Beat and corner In the
lonvehtion hall.
StiH later Belshawof Contj-a Costa stood
ap with 'a resolution which he presented
to the convention. He referred In his in
troductory remarks to the great Presl
3ent and his capable administration, but
It was reserved for that little resolution
to bring forth the utmost resources of
the convention in expressing Its patriot-
Fin and fervor. Bplshaw referred to those
gallant "boys in blue," whether on land
Five hundred people In Germania Hall went wild with approbation when the following resolution was presented I '* Resolved, that we, the Republicans of the Third Congressional District in convention assembled, desire to return
our heartfelt gratitude to our boys in blue, both on sea and lend, for their heroism end valor at all times and under all conditions; and to the bereaved ones of our gallant defenders who have so willingly given up their lives for our beloved
i<mntry, we extend our deepest sympathy.'*
or sea, without whom the most fearless
President and the most capable adminis
tration would be as reeds in a storm.
His words were seconded by a rising
voteâ not only did the delegates rise in
honor of the heroes of '98, but their hats,
canes, circulars, chairs, and in many in
stances their feet rose so as to add to
the intensity of the approval with which
the motion was received.
The leader of the Alameda delegation
was Hon. John \V. Ellsworth, the "honest
John" of the Alameda bench. As a dele
gate at large at the primaries he received
probably the largest individual vote ever
received at any primary in this county.
One of the shrewdest pieces of work
done by the Metcalf managers was to
head their ticket with John Ellsworth,
whose portly figure seemed to be entirely
at home surrounded by the sixty-seven
other delegates from Alameda.
"General" Veale, the Sheriff of Contra
Costa, brought down his delegation of ten
to join in the nomination of Metcalf. No
one knew Sheriff Veale to be a "General"
until a messenger boy delivered a dis
patch to Chairman Evans, who at once
called for the Contra Costa Sheriff, at
the same time announcing him as "Gen
eral."
Delegate Benjamin of Solano, who
bears some resemblance to an attenuated
Senator Earl, was much in evidence. He
averaged nearly two feet higher than the
rest of the delegation, but otherwise was
not prominent except when he had a cor
rection made in the report of the commit
tee on credentials. *
Arthur North, who expects to be the
next district attorney of Yolo County, and
who is a brother of Hart H. North of this
county, had evidently done good work for
Metcalf in his own district, for out of the
eight delegates elected last Wednesday
seven were for Metcalf and the eighth
dropped into line as soon as the result of
Alameda's primary became known.
The intervals during recesses were taken
full advantage of by all kinds of candi
dates. Frank Jordan and Cal Ewing but
ton-holed all the delegates from outside of
Alameda in the Interests of Dr. Pard.ee. If
the thirty-four delegates did not return
to their respective homes converted mis
sionaries to the cause of the doctor it was
not the fault of the Alameda men. Frank
Jordan tackled a man from .Lake County
and did everything but go on his knees
and pray to induce the visitor to go home
at once and howl himself hoarse tor
George Pardee.
Assemblyman Frank M. Leavitt, who
will probably till the seat in the next Leg
islature so honorably tilled for years by
the late Senator Eli S. Denison, was busy
making himself known to anybody who
had not met him, but this task did not
prove irksome to him and he lilled in his
spare moments booming Alameda'ts candi
date for Governor. There was a sugges
tion made that a resolution commending
the generosity and stalwart Republican
principles of the late Senator Denison be
passed by the convention, but it was de
cided that such an action belonged more
properly to the county convention, which
will be held in the middle of next month.
Court Commissioner Babcock, who an
nounced a few months ago that he also
was a candidate for Congress, should cer
tainly be satisfied with his efforts in the
convention. The colonel presented a reso
lution and afterward spoke to it in a man
ner that gained him nearly as much ap
plause as the successful ca uiidate. It
looked for a few minutes as if the colonel
were trying to steal some of the thunder
that Judge Nusbaumer had reserved f. <v
his nominating speech. But later it was
found that there was no dearth of ideas
for the Judge when he took the platform.
Another ngure that is always seen at
Republican gatherings was that of Darby
Knowles. Everybody knows Darby and
Darby never lets an opportunity pass to
put himself forward with a resolution,
a motion, or some kind of a suggestion.
At last night's meeting of the Repub
lican League Darby made the closing
speech, and to-day he was to the fore
on the floor until he had transacted a
little business with Will D. Henshaw,
when, apparently satisfied he withdrew.
Darby enjoyed the distinction of being
the only Davis man in the Young Men's
Republican League, but he bore that dis
tinction with dignity and equanimity.
Colonel W. H. H. FJussey was around
making friends in his efforts to succeed
Sheriff White; Will H. Church let no

FRANK F, DAVIS
TO PRESENT THE
NAME OF GAGE
fipeclal Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 20.â The dis
tinguished honor of placing before the
Republican State convention the name
of Henry T. Gage for Governor of Cali
fornia has fallen to the lot of Frank
F. Davis, the eloquent orator of Los
Angeles. "
Mr. Davis Is a polished speaker and
he will undoubtedly take advantage of
the opportunity afforded him to make
the effort of his life. Hje and Gage
are warm friends of long standing, they
having met at the national convention
In Chicago in 1888, at which time Mr.
Davis placed In nomination Walter Q.
Gresham for President of the United
Btates. In the same convention Henry
T. Gage seconded the nomination of
Levi P. Morton for Vice-President. The
friendship then formed has lasted to the
present time.
Mr. Davis, when seen to-day regard
ing his candidacy for Congress, said
that he would do nothing to antagonize
any other candidate. If the convention
saw fit to give to him the nomination
he would accept the honor and make
the best canvass he knew how. The
reason he did not enter the fl^ht earlier
in the campaign was his friendship for
James McLachlan, who has since with
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL,. SUNDAY, AUGUST 21, 1898.
drawn. He does not feel that he is
justified In believing that if a slate has
been made he can break it. It is inti
mated, however, that he knows his
strength in the delegation and that
there will be a sensation when the re
sult is known.
The warm friendship existing be
tween Gage and Davis ma- be an Im
portant factor in landing the nomina
tion for the latter. The nominating
speech also will give Davis an oppor
tunity to display his ability as an ora
tor, an accomplishment which his op
ponent does not possess.
Those of the delegates who have not
yet left for Sacramento will leave Sun
day morning or evening. Nearly all
left last night and to-day, many of
whom will stop in San Francisco be
fore going to the city of sizzling heat
and seething convention.
So far no one has been decided upon
for chairman of the delegation, and the
matter has been left in abeyance until
all of the delegates arrive at their des
tination. It is, however generally un
derstood that the Los Angeles delega
tion will not ask for either a perma T
nent or temporary chairmanship of the
convention. They will center their
whole fight on oage for Governor and
will do nothing that may injure his
chances for receiving the nomination.
One by one, unhonored and unher
alded, the roundheads and the push are
returning with drawn faces from the
so-called Democratic convention, which
has given the party a pinto candidate
for Governor. They went to Sacra
mento full of internal greatness and
they return beaten, battered and com
pletely done up, and there is silence in
the Democratic camp hereâ deep, omi
nous silenceâ which Maguire will at
tempt to break on August 27, when he
will address the Silver Republican
State convention, which at this time
seems to be the onh' leg left for Democ
racy to stand on in this county.

SELECTION IS UNANIMOUS
Throughout the Nominating and Second
ing Speeches the Success of the
Republican Party Was the
Watchword.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, Oakland,
Aug. 20.â The Third Congressional Dis
trict convention was called to order
promptly by Chairman W. H. Friend. In
a few remarks he paid a high compliment
to the present condition of the Republi
can party in this county. He referred to
the fact that two years ago he caned to
order a Republican convention In Vallejo
which nominated a winner, and he ex
pressed his confidence that the conven
tion present would do likewise.
Colonel Babcock took the floor and nom
inated for temporary chairman J. W.
Evans of the Seventh Ward, and the
choice was made unanimous. Frank
Storer. of Eimhurst was elected secre
tary, and C. A. Fawcett sergeant-at
arms, with Frank Severa as his assistant.
Chairman Evans named the committees
on credentials and platform, and after a
recess of a half hour they were ready to
report.
The committee on credentials consisted
of T. W. Harris, N. A. McConaughy,
George Hoguet, John Trotter, Abe P.
Leach, H. B. Carlton, from Alameda
County; J. H. Dungan of Yolo, William
Herbison of Solano, M. B. Ivory of Con
tra Costa, D, W. Jones of Colusa, A.
Hochheimer of Glenn and W. L. Maxwell
of Lake.
The commlttte on platform and resolu
tions was made up of George Babcock.
H. A. Mnyhew. Paxton Wright. C. B.
Morgan, B. McDermott Jr., of Alameda
County; R. M. Beattie of Lake, James
McGarry of Solano, C. M. Belshaw of
Contra Costa, Mark Chamberlain of Tolo,
J. E. Hathborne of Colusa and J. H. W es
ton of Glenn.
The report of the committee on creden
tials and order of business was a very
routine document, and was at once ac
cepted, with a few corrections regarding i
the delegates.
Chairman Babcock of the committee
on platform presented a report that was ,
remarkable for its brevity.
To Judge Emil Nusbaumer was award
ed the task of placing in nomination Vic
tor H. Metcalf, and in his speech he said.
"To me has been allotted the pleasant
duty and the great honor of Presenting
to you the name of one who seeks your
suffrage upon this occasion. I do soon
behalf of one of the most populous coun
ties in your district, likewise the ban
ner Republican county of the State or
California-the county of Alameda. >VÂ£h
full confidence that those great duties
which are required of one in that position
will be faithfully fulfilled and energetical
ly carried out. I present to you the name
of Victor H. Metcalf. The people of the
county of Alameda ask that you place
that name upon your ticket as your and
their representative. Mr. Metcalf ha* al
ways been found battling in the front
rank of the Republican party that party
which has made the history of this coun
try, that party which whenever the hour
of trial was at hand carried this great
country to a successful issue. Gentle
men I have not come here with any set
or prepared speech. The duties that have
devolved upon me within the last few
days have been such that what I say to
you is simply what at the moment comes
to me. I have heard some very eloquent
words pronounced here to-day by our
friend Colonel Babcock. Every word that
he has said I fully indorse and know that
every one of you here fully indorse. You
know that the Republican party should
be aided and assisted by the strongest
man that we can put upon its ticket, that
whenever that is done there is no ques
tion about the result. You know that
this country will keep going to the high
est pinnacle of fame, that it will be suc
cessful, both in peace and war, both
upon the seas and upon the land, when
ever the Republican party has the helm
of the ship of state in hand. (Applause.)
Gentlemen, I again present to you the
name of Victor H. Metcalf and ask you
in the name of Alameda County to place
hiÂ« name upon your ticket. I know, and
you all know, that it will add strength
to the ticket. His record is before you.
It is an open book, and it has been read
and approved." '
Arthur --orth of Yolo seconded the
nomination of Metcalf in a vigorous
speech, and W. M. Dimmick also second
ed on behalf of the Fiftieth Assembly
District. The speech of Mr. Dimmick
was the last link in the chain of har
mony, for Mr. Dimmick was a candidate
on the Hilborn ticket, but owing to an
agreement amicably reached over two
contested ballots Mr. Dimmick and the
other Hilborn men were declared elected.
This was the only district where there
was the slightest possibility of a contest
in favor of Mr. Hilborn, and as every
thing else was so overwhelming for Met
calf it was not difficult to maintain per
fect harmony.
When the nominations were declared
closed. Mr. Metcalf was nominated by ac
clamation. There were then loud cries
of "Metcalf. Metcalf, Metcalf," from all
parts of the hall, and Chairman Evans
appointed Will Henshaw and Judge Nus
haumer a committee to escort the candi
date to the platform. Mr. Metcalf ac
cepted the nomination in the following
language:
"I should be made of flint and not of
flesh did 1 not feel profoundly moved dv
this expression of your confidence ana
! your esteem. Indeed, I am deeply touched
iand am extremely gratified. 3c ou nave
conferred upon me this moment a distin
j guiehed honor and lam not forgetf u. ot
: the great duties and responsibilities which
i accompany that hcmor. It is no light tning
! for a man to stand before the representa
! tives of this district as a candidate for
Congress, and it was only after long ana
serious consideration that I allowed my
name to be brought forward. I said to
myself, "Surely such an ambition is a
worthy one; it is an ambition which any
man may hold without reproach. In this,
as in all other matters pertaining to our
government, *he people are the final ar
biters. It is for them to decide. If the
choice should fall on me, I shall accept it
as a signal expression of confidence and
esteem and as a declaration that I am
about to change the field of my labor and
as an Imposition of great responsibility.
| The choice has fallen on me. I accept it,
gentlemen, as I have said before, with the
most profound gratitude. You will not cx
i pect me at this time and under these cir
cumstances to speak to you upon the
promlrtent issues of this campaign. Be
fore this campaign is over I will have ad
dressed you all in your respective coun
ties. For the present, then, let it suffice
for me to say that I stand squarely upon
the platform which this convention has
adopted, and that I shall go through this
campaign and afterward to Washington
with the utmost loyalty to Republican
principles, to our national administration,
to dur great, strong leader, William Mc-
Kinley."
Jones Formally Accepts.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, OAK
LAND, Aug. 20.â John Aubrey Jones
of Fruitvale, the People's party nomi
nee for Congrress from the Third Dis

Call the following
letter 'of accept
ance:
"It Is with pro
found gratification
that I accept the
honors that have
been heaped upon
me by my fellow
citizens of the
Third Congression
al District.
"That I am the
nominee for Con
gress of the Peo
ple's party, the
Democratic party
and the Silver Re
publicans, is not due to any special
worth or merit of mine, but to the fact
that I stand as the representative and
exponent of true Democracy; that is.
rule of the people as opposed to the
dominance of corporate power crystal
lized into rule of pelf.
"While my opponent has, during
weeks and months, depended upon a
thoroughly constructed and well-oiled
system of political machinery to grind
out for him a single nomination, I
have, without any effort, and almost
wholly unsolicited, secured two nom
inations at the hands of two conven
tions. Dull, insensate and unapprecia
tive indeed would I be did I not deeply
feel a sense of obligation to my fel
low-citizens for this expression of con
fidence. Conscious am I, too, of the
great responsibility that Is imposed
upon me to so conduct my campaign as
to make it in every sense reflect honor
upon my friends and supporters, and
to be crowned with that measure of
success our righteous cause so justly
merits.
"My candidacy and that of my op
ponent epitomizes the antipodal con
dition of a latter-day political con
test. JOHN AUBREY JONES."
JACOB NEFF FOR CHAIRMAN.
It is generally understood' that "the
chairmanship of the Republican State
Convention wJll be tendered to Jacob
Neff. The choice will prove acceptable
to all delegates, as well as all Repub
licans, in the State. Judge Frank Short
of Fresno will probably be chosen as
vice chairman, and A. L. Levinsky of
Stockton will get the place of second
vice chairman.
DELEGATES HOLD A CAUCUS.
Sixteen or seventeen members of the San
Francisco delegation to the Republican
State Convention held a caucus at the
California Hotel last evening and the
delegates present decided to support At
torney General W. F. Fitzgerald for
the nomination for Governor.
The caucus was called by Martin Kelly,
who sent a . couple of his hired men
around the city to notify such members
to attend as could be induced to do so.
Mr. Fitzgerald denied late last evening
that he knew anything about the caucus
being held. , J

CALL, HEADQUARTERS. OAKLAND,
Aug. 20.â The platform adopted by the
Third District Congressional Convention
to-day is a model that might well be fol
lowed by all the iÂ»onventions that will be
held before the time for nominations ex
pires. It is as follows:
"The Republicans of the Third Con
gressional District of the State of Cali
fornia, in convention assembled, here
by renew their pledge of fealty to the
great principles of the Republican
party, as expressed in the platform of
the "National Convention of the Re
publican party held at St. Louis in
June. 1896.
"They express their continuing con
fidence in the wise judgment and mas
terly statesmanship of our great Presi
dent, William McKinley, and unhesi
tatingly intrust the decision of the
great governmental problems which
have now arisen to the wisdom of him
self and his counselors.
"We congratulate him upon the hap
py termination of the war so recently
concludedâa war in which this nation
engaged only at the call of suffering
humanityâ and we pledge the loyal aid
of our Representative from this dis
trict in upholding the policy of the
administration."
After the platform had been unanimous
ly and vigorously adopted, Colonel Bab
cock presented the following resolution:
"Resolved, That the best interests of
the country and the highest interests
of humanity demand that we should
establish our sovereignty over every
foot of territory we nave conquered
from Spain, not only as an indemnity
for the costs of war, but as a guar
anty against the oppression, bigotry
and brutalities which for centuries
have been imposed on the helpless in
habitants of the Greater Antilles and
Philippine Islands."
The colonel then delivered an Impas
sioned address in support of his resolu
tion. In the course of his remarks hÂ«
said:
"To give back the Inhabitants of thes*
islands to a power whose rule of then;
has been distinguished by bloodthirsty
rapacious violence and cruelty would be
to visit upon them the revenge Spain is
impotent to Inflict upon us. The Philip
pine Islands have fallen into our hands
as the logical and inevitable result ol
war, and we cannot, if we would, sel!
them or turn them over to any other na
tion without doing violence to the most
sacred and vital principles at the found
ation of our Government. Nor can we
withdraw our military forces without
turning them over to anarchy or the re
morseless cruelty of Spain. "We cannot
avoid or compromise ihe issues which
are upon us. if we would. We may not
desire to possess the islands^ but we can
not escape our destiny."
It was reserved for Delegate Belshaw
of Solano to introduce the resolution
that eclipsed all others. He said that
there were other people than the Presi
dent and the administration who were
entitled to credit for the successful con
duct of the late war, and they were the
men who stood so bravely behind the
guns. In their honor, he said, he would
introduce a short resolution, which waa
carried by a rising vote.
The new Congressional committee waa
appointed as follows:
At large. George W. Reed: Lake Coun
ty, R. M. Beattie; Contra Costa County,
J. L. Geary Jr.; Yolo County. Mark
Chamberlain: Glenn County, J. K. Ken
dricks: Solano County, Charles A. Dur
ner; Colusa County, J. S. Balsdon; For

Schweer; Forty-seventh, E. A. Randlett;
F<>ny-eighth. Frank Barnett; Forty
ninth. W. W. Morrison; Fiftieth. Mir
tier Smith; Fifty-first, George D. Met
calf.
After naming T. T. Dargie. George D.
Metcalf. Rod Church. H. O. TrowbrMge
and Charles T. Rudolph as a committee
in accordance with the purity of election
laws to supervise the financial part of
Mr. Metcalf' s campaign, the convention
adjourned with three cheers for every
thing Republican.
"Poudinky" Will Be There.
OAKLAND. Aug. 20.â About sixty mem
bers of the "Pondinky" and the Young
Men's Republican League have chartered
a Pullman car and will leave for Sac

PARDEE STILL CONFIDENT.
Gossip of the Men Who Are Pre
paring for the Contest
Next Week.
Early yesterday morning It was
whispered around the corridors of the
Palace Hotel that Henry T. Gage had
secured during the night the support of
prominent men connected with the San
Francisco delegation, and as the report
gained headway political strikers and
others anxious to be near the winner
tumbled over one another in their haste
to invade the headquarters of the Los
Angeles candidate. The rumor soon
reached the Pardee camp that the city
delegation had agreed to stand in for
Gage. The champions of Pardee were
toot daunted. Heeding the Bible lesson
that there Is "more corn in Egypt"
they began to reach out for country
support, and many delegates from the
interior were Introduced to the favor- i
Ite son of Alameda. The followers of I
Pardee deemed it best, however, to add !
to the strength of their cause by organ- j
izlng the friends of the doctor, other
than delegates, for service at Sacra
mento, hence an independent organiza
tion with W. H. Friend as chairman
was established. An executive commit
tee of twenty-five will make It a point
to rally at Sacramento an army of Par
dee sympathizers.
Another alarming rumor reached the
Alameda camp. This was a story that
the State Central Committee was
standing in with Gage. Little credence
was attached to this rumor by Dr. Par
dee. The relations existing between
the State Committee and all the can
didates are cordial. Gape has the ad
vantage of position, being in a fair way
T" catch the overflow from the commit
tee headquarters on one side and the
headquarters of the California National
Guard Â«n the other. Major McLaugh
lin of the State Central Committee and
Dr. l'ard<Â«e had a little conference of
their own last evening, and It must
Veen agreeable, for both emerged
smiling from the scene of the inter-
Alarneda can parade a fine phalanx
of talking talent, and should the
dreaded combination of Los Angeles
and San Francisco become Imminent In
ithe convention lonef-distance telephones
â vviil not be needed to hear the roars of
resentment from the Alameda delega
tion. Among the ready and forcible
talkers in the delegation are: Frank
K. Mntt. J. W. Tompkins. W. H.
"Waste, E. B. Thompson. J. G. Mottos
Jr., H. J. Tisdale. Frank Purcell. G. B.
Daniels, W. A. Dow, C. L. Tisdale, J.
}'.. Lanktree and G. W. Evans. Some
of the young orators have not passed
through the ordeal of speaking in a
State convention, and others may ex
perience the grievous disappointment
of failing to gain the recognition of the
presiding officer. Dr. Pardee's follow
ers, buoyant and active, are prepared
to show the people of California what
united Alameda can do.
.. Senator Perkins and M. M. Estee had
a talk aside on the situation. It was
â by no means a star-chamber proceed
ing, as it was held in sight of every
one who cared to look down the corri
dor for signs.
The San Francisco contingent was
puzzled when the story got around
that Burns and Pardee were together.
Later on the fact was revealed that
ex-Senator Byrnes of San Mateo, an
old-time stalwart of Republican faith,
called to pay his respects to Dr. Par
dee. Twenty years ago Mr. Byrnes
served In the State Senate with Dr.
Pardee, the father of the candidate for
the gubernatorial nomination. The In
cident calls to memory the fact that
Senator Pardee was one of the ablest
and most efficient men that ever served
the State of California, and as chair
man of the Senate Finance Committee
throttled every plundering appropria
tion referred to his committee. There
is a theory that genius skips a genera
tion, and if that be correct a son of
Alameda's present candidate for Gov
ernor should be a great man. In this
campaign Oakland is so full of re
sources that an illustrious grandfather
â¢of the candidate may be cited.
Alexander Brown of Calaveras came
tn town yesterday along with Judge
Dg,vis of Amador. Mr. Brown is a can
didate for the State Board of Equaliza
tion for the Second District, now repre
sented by L,. V. Morehouse. The latter
has served many years on the board
and acquired a vast fund of informa
tion concerning the values of city and
county property. He is not a candidate

convention should deem it wise in the

the field he would accept the responsi
bility.
Southern California Republicans want
i three places on the State ticket and
they expect to get them. All the local
fights south of Tehachapi have been
settled and the delegations will vote to
gether. First on the southern list, of
course, is Henry T. ,Gage fur Governor.
i Delegates from the south now in the
i city declare that he will sweep that sec
tion if nominated and come north with
an overwhelming majority over lla
ffutre.
Mr. Gage is a hard worker and has a
magnetic personality, which wins with
the delegates, and, as a delegate ex
pressed it yesterday, "He is a vote get
ter." If nominated he will make an
active campaign and give the fusion
candidate a harder battle than the fol
lowers of the "Little Giant" anticipate.
As a stump speaker Gage has few
equals and as an indefatigable hustler
he has not a peer in the State.
Alter Gage the south wants Captain
Truman Keeves of San Bernardino
nominated for State Treasurer. Captain
Keeves arrived yesterday and registered
at the Palace. He says the manage
ment of his candidacy is entirely in the
hands of his friends, and that he is
satislied with the prospects. Captain
Reeves served through the civil war in
the Army of the Potomac. He wears an
empty sleeve and a Grand Army of the
Republic badge. He is now serving a
' second term as Treasurer of San Ber
! nardino County. His friends think he is
! a sure winner.
The sunland politicians think one
1 place on the bench of the Supreme
' Court should be held by a Jurist from
i the south and they are just now ar
raneing to concentrate on one man
from "hat section. Judge W N Clark
â¢ of Los Angeles and Judge B. P. Wll
> liams of Ventura seek the nomination.
! The rumor was circulated yesterday
i that Judge Clark has all but decided
i to withdraw and leave an open field for
I Judge Williams. Both gentlemen are
; in the city, but they have nothing to
â  say of their prospects of securing the
' coveted place on ihe State ticket.
Dr. Pardee's headquarters were
j crowded all day yesterday with his
â  friends from Alameda County. In fact
I the Alamedans were so numerous and
occupied so much of their candidate's
time that he hardly had a chance to
shake hands with the few country dele
gates who called to see him. Realizing
that they were monopolizing the doc
tor's time to his great disadvantage the
workers got together last evening and
organized to work systematically. As
sessor Henry P. Dalton was made
chairman and "Billy" Friend was elect
ed secretary of what is jokingly calied
the "Oilroom Executive Committee.
After the organization was completed
the chairman detailed several squads to
visit the various hotels and round up
such stray delegates as had not already
found an open entrance into the Gage |
camp and had there been corraled. Dr.
Pardee's politicians, with a few excep
tions, are playing at a same with which
they are very unfamiliar. If the> par
ticipate in a few more campaigns they
willT perhaps, know more than they do
at present. ...
This evening the Pardee forces will
transfer their base of operations to
Sacramento. The doctor and a large
coterie of his faithful followers will de
part on the evening train. To-morrow

GAGE VINDICATED.
Stephen M. White States the Facts
Concerning Recent Charges.
The Democratic Senator Who Seconded the Nomination of Maguire
Will Stand Between the Republican Aspirant
and Slanderous Attacks.
BAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 19. IS9B
Hon. Stephen M. White, Palace Hotel, San Franciscoâ My Dear Sir: It Is natural for every Californlan to be
solicitous about the good name of his State and mindful of the effect upon It of the character of men put forward
for public positions. Mr. Henry T. Gage is a prominent candidate of a political party for the gubernatorial nomi
nation. It is publicly charged that he was found in fraud in a civil litigation in the Superior Court of Los Ange
les County, and that he was indicted on account of matters involved in the same transaction. These charges
are so serious as to disqualify him for public preferment. I ask you as a citizen of that county and one trusted
by men of all parties for a statement as to the validity of these charges. The issue involved Is higher than the
Interests of any person or party. Very truly yours.
SENATOR WHITE'S REPLY.
PALACE HOTEL, BAN FRANCISO. Aug. 20, IS9B.
E. F. Preston Esq.â Dear Sir: Yours of the 19th, regarding certain charges made against Henry T. Gage 'th
reference to litigation in Loa Angeles County received. It is needless to say tha,t I intend to support and r am
tain the interest of the Democratic candidate for Governor at the coming election, but this purpose does not to
any extent affect my duty to state facts bearing upon accusations affecting the integrity and personal character of
opposing candidates.
It is asserted that Henry T. Gage, who aspires to be elected Governor, was concerned in litigation in the courts
of Los Angeles County which affected his character, 'mere are at least two reasons Justifying me in commenting
upon this. In the first place, I was an attorney representing Mr. Gage. In the second place, I have known him
intimately for an extended period and have become entirely familiar with all of his traits and personal inclina
tions.
I do not hesitaate to say that no turpitude of any kind or In any particular was shown In the controversy
mentioned. Personally being thoroughoughly acquainted with Mr. Gage for more than twenty years, I am satisfied
that he is in all respects an honorable man. He has resided in Los Angeles County ever since he was sued, and
has become one of the most prominent and universally appreciated citizens of Southern California.
He is conceded to be a leading member of the bar, and has the confidence of the profession. His stipulation,
verbal or written, has always been considered his bond, and no man, so far as I know, whatever may be his stand
ing or prejudice, doubts Gage's honesty.
This ought to be sufficient to negative any aspersions connected with an action which was never determined,
and which was permitted to pass unacted upon as regards a final judgment.
The trial of the matter to which I am alluding was had before a Judge who was a very able man, but at
the same time not free from prejudice. He was undoubtedly a strong man, but was apt to draw conclusions
not logically, reasonably or properly deuucible from the evidence.
Mr. Gage's case was appealed to the Supreme Court. It was never examined as to its merits by that tri
bunal, because It was held that the appeal was from an t â erlocutory order, and could not be allowed. Therefore
the Supreme Court never passed upon the sufficiency of the evidence to justify the decision of the Judge below.
I am satisfied that the decision of the lower court was entirely unjustifiable. This I think must be the view of
any one who has examined the evidence as I have. But Mr. Gage's history is clear and convincing. The position
which he occupies at home, at the bar and personally, and the unsolicited support which he is there receiving for
the Governorship prove my comment to be well grounded. He has this merit at least: Thos,e who have known him
longest are his warmest adherents. The reflections which are Involved in a reference to this ancient suit, which has
been open to all investigators for a fifth of a century, cannot be considered Important. If there was anything in
these charges those who have lived in Los Angeles, where they originated, would not have the high respect for Mr.
Gage which 1b universally entertained.
No allusion would have been made to this case were it not for the political exigencies of certain individuals.
While Mr. Gage and I do not agree politically, and do not vote together, I trust that he will be defeated upon
political grounds only. As to the Indictment to which you refer, it was found by a Grand Jury without any no
tice to Mr. Gage, on the evidence only of the plaintiff in the civil suit and upon the suggestion of a District Attor
ney who was one of the counselin the civil suit. This same District Attorney afterward dismissed the indictment
sooner than meet a trial which Mr. Gage demanded. The dismissal was made upon the specified ground that there
was no evidence to sustain it.

BATTLE ROYAL AT THE
RENO SILVER PRIMARY.
Factional Feud Revived and Many
Blows Are Struck, but There Is
No Bloodshed.
RENO. Aug. 20.â Expectations that to
day's Silver party Washoe County prim
aries would pass off quietly, based upon
the orderly â almost cut-and-dried â man
ner In which Thursday night's meeting
for the selection of thirty candidates for
delegates was carried through, were up
set early In the day. No sooner were the
polls opened at 1 o'clock than trouble
commenced. All the factional dissensions
of the party, many of which had been
buried, were resuscitated and made to do
their share in the contests or quarrels of
the day.
The resurrection of the old asylum fight,
in which Superintendent Bernstein and
State Treasurer Westerfield led opposing
Bides, was first made apparent by the ar
rival on the scene of Bernstein, Francis
Robb and about all the other asylum em
ployes and their friends, while the oppos
ing side was represented by C. A. Nor
cross, AY. G. Caffrey and others. It did
not take long for these sides to resume
old-time hostilities. Robb struck Nor
cross, or somebody struck somebody else,
and then the game was open to all
comers.
Caffrey knocked Robb down. Nichols,
from the asylum, struck Caffrey and Dan
O'Keefe knocked the former down. A
general melee followed and canes, knives
and guns were just coming into play
when a few of the better and stronger
element, by sheer strength, muzzled the
combatants and forced them apart. As
far as can be ascertained no one suf
fered more serious injury than a sore
head or blackened eye.
Governor Sadler came in for his share
of compliments and it was stated he had
been offered $500 as inducement to sign
the prizefight bill. Treasurer Wester
field's vote was challenged, but after a
hot wrangle was allowed.
ihe polls closed at 7 o'clock, 358 votes
being cast.
At midnight the count is Incomplete,
but strongly Indicates the election of the
anti-Sadler-Bergstein delegates.
OVATION TO JUDGE CONLEY.
Madera Warmly Greets Its Candidate
for the Supreme Bench.
MADERA, Aug. 20.â A grand ovation
was tendered the Hon. W. M. Conley. Su
perior Judge of the County of Madera,
this evening on his return home from the
Democratic State Convention at Sacra
mento, where he had received the nomin
ation for the office of Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court.
A large crowd of the prominent citizens
and business men of Madera, headed. by
the Madera brass band, met the Judge at
the depot and escorted him to the Opera
House, where it was previously arranged
that the reception should be held. Dis
trict Attorney L,arew acted as chairman
of the meeting and in a few well-chosen
words introduced the Judge, who. al
though not in condition for speechmaking.
thanked the people for the- high appre
ciation they had shown him, after which
the audience gave a hearty three cheers
and adjourned.
The Supreme Court Clerkship.
Edward I. Sheehan, candidate for
Clerk of the Supreme Court, is a popu
lar native son and prominent business
man, and is well and favorably known
throughout the State. His many friends
who are supporting 1 his candidacy and
urging his nomination say that as the
Democrats have nominated a Silver Re
publican for this office the Republicans
should name a man who is strong and
popular not alone with his own party,
but also among the Democrats. It is
claimed in Mr. Sheehan's behalf that
he is the only candidate yet mentioned
who is strong enough to draw any large
number of Democratic votes to the Re
publican State ticket.

PLENTY OF EVIDENCE OF
FRAUD BY THE GANG
SAX JOSE, Aug. 20â The Good Govern
ment League delegates will go to the Re
publican convention backed by such proof
as they believe will clearly show them
entitled to sÂ«-ats In the convention. Since
the late R<-;x primaries the league has
had able and careful men at work se
curing evidences of fraud. They have
secured any amount of it and have it
properly prepared and certified.
While the league has not made the
character of this evidence public, it is
known that one thing to be clearly shown
is that many men voted In the primary
who were not entitled to do so. It is
stated to be a fact that proof is in hand
to show that life-long Democrats were
freely voted by the gang in their desper
ation to carry the primaries. Other things
which will be shown is that there was
fraud, and wholesale fraud In the recep
tion of the ballots. C. J. Cornell's affi
davit teliK how his ballot was skillfully
made to disappear and ont- h<- had not
voted put in the bo* in its stead.
At a meeting of the league tnis after
noon it was decided to establish a morn-
Ing daily here, a paper to be known as
the San Jose Republican. There are good
men and true, with any amount of means
b"liin<f it. One of the men in the meeting
said: "I have been paying money to that
corrupt :-hÂ»-Ht. the Mercury, to be robbed
by it. 1 have turned it down forever."
And this is the general feeling among all
decent citizens.
A committee was appointed to prepare
articles of incorporation, with instruc
tions to get them ready within the next
ten or fifteen daysâ next week if possible.
The company will be formed at once, as
large blocks of stock have already been
pledged.
A full delegation will leave here at 9:20
o'clock Monday morning for Sacramento.
Ail wiio were candidates at the late pri
mary will go. and contend that ;is they
were counted out they are the true repre
sentatives They will battle for their
rights, believing they will win. Their
looks, bturir.g and conduct, not to men
tion names, will give them a standing
anywhere. There is not a "jobber" or cor
ruptionlÃt among them. Their personnel
will impress the convention, and stands
in bold contrast to the Job lot of gang
sters â so-railed Republicans and Demo
crutsâwho make up the great bulk of the
R>-a followers.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUXDAT, AUGUST 31, 1898.
GAVE HIM THE GLASS EYE.
How a Patient Shocked Steward Fo
garty of the Receiving Hospital.
A rather poorly dressed middle-aged man walked
Into the Receiving Hospital yesterday morning and
asked that a wound over his left eye be dressed.
"How were you Injured?" inquired Night Steward
Fog-arty.
"Got Into a scrap," was the laconic reply of the
stranger.
The cut was not a serious one, and after It was
examined by the surgeon the steward applied a
simple dressing and proceeded to put a bandage
over the injury. The wound was such that the
bandage necessarily covered the eye nearest the
wound. The patient made no protest about having
the eye covered, but the other eye kept staring
blankly at the wall on the opposite side of the room.
Fogarty was particular in adjusting the bandage so
it would give as little discomfort to the patient as
possible, and when the operation was finished he,.
In a patronizing way, told the stranger he could go.
"How do you expect me to find my way?"
aske<l the patient, attempting to take the bandage
off his eye.
"Use the other eye." angrily retorted Fogarty.
"How can I?" remarked the stranger. "This
bandage shuts off my vision."
"Don't give me any work like that," testily re
plied the steward. "Tou must think I'm a dead
one."
"So is this," -emarked the patient as he removed
a glass eye from the socket that had escaped being
covered by the bandage, and handed the lump of
glass to the astonished steward.
"That's one on me, " laughingly replied Fogarty.
"Here Is 10 cents, get a drink at the nearest
saloon."
The stranger, who gave his name as Charles
McDonald, explained that about a year ago he had
his right eye shot out during a quarrel over a game
of craps.
He had a glass eye Inserted simply to "add to
his beauty," as he expressed It.
After hearing his story Fogarty rather sheepish
ly extended his hand to the strange patient and told
him to call again if he needed medical attention.

PUTRIFIED MEAT
SERVED TO MEN
ON THE ST. PAUL
After Having Been Condemned at
Honolulu It Is Taken
Back on Board.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
Special Correspondence of The Calt.
HONOLULU, Aug. 11.â An unpleasant episode has occurred In con
nection with the provisions of the transport St. Paul that certainly de
serves the closest Investigation by the American people. The following
report briefly gives the facts:
OFFICE OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.
HONOLULU. Aug. 8. 1898.
Hon. W. O. Smith, President of the Board of Healthâ Sir: The atten
tion of Dr. Mor.tsarrat and myself having been ctUled to the fact that a
large amount (several thousand pounds) of beef, pork and mutton had been
landed from the troopship St. Paul to an unfit . condition for food, to be
placed In cold storage, we to-day made thorough examination of the same
and find-
That said beef, pork and mutton when landed was unfit for food; that
It showed all the condition* Immediately preceding putrefaction In the best
pieces, and that In a majority of the quarters and sides it showed evidence
of an advanced state of decay, making it unwholesome as food and dan
gerous to health. Yours respectfully, ARTHUR JOHNSTONE.
Commissioner of Food.
But this Is not the worst. In a report read at a subsequent meeting
of the Board of Health it was shown that the meat, after having been
condemned, was taken aboard the St. Paul to be doled out to the vol
unteers during the remainder of the voyage to Manila. The Honolulu au
thorities considered themselves powerless to prevent this outrage.
H. SuzzaUo of San Jose spoke on behalf
of the San Jose committee, and said that
ample preparations have been made for
the entertainment of Native Sons and
their friends. They promised a royal re
ception on the night of the Bth. with fire
works and music. They said that the clty

DISPOSITION OF CONQTTEBED

This Country Should Not Cease to
Control Until the Natives
Are Able to Govern
Themselves.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SARATOGA. Aug. 20.â Chancellor
McCracken of the University of New
York, as chairman of the committee of
; twenty-one on resolutions, presented to
the National Conference on the Foreign
Policy of the United States a report,
which he said had been unanimously
agreed upon by the committee. The
: resolutions were unanimously adopted
; by the conference as follows:
"We. the participants in the national
conference on the foreign policy of the
'â  United States, held at Saratoga on Au
gust 19 and 20. 1898. are unanimously
agreed as follows:
"We commend the wise and patriotic
, purpose of the national administration
In lirst seeking to avoid war with Spain.
I and subsequently prosecuting the war
I with higher aims and success in bringing
â it to a speedy conclusion. It is glorious
i to our arms and gratifying to the high
I aspirations of our peuple.
"On behalf of freedom and human wel
i fare we thank the omeers and men of our
| army and navy for their skillful and ho
! roic achievements on land and sea and
I for their chivalrous conduct toward the
! defeated enemy. We believe that the res
! cued and liberated people of the surren
i dered islands are, in a sense, temporarily
! the wards of the conquering nation, and
we should treat them as such.
"With our success, with our view of
natural rtpht and of the inestimable
privileges <>f civil liberty, we should not
be Justified in returning the conquered
i islands to the misrule and oppression
i from which we have relieved them. As
I soon as the islands under our present
protection can be trusted to govern
themselves, they should be allowed to
do so. the United States retaining under
its authority only necessary naval sta
tions. Until such time as they may be
able to' govern themselves they should
continue under the protection of the Uni
ted States, and the question as to wheth
er, at some future peril >d and at the mu
tual desire of both, they should be per
manently annexed should be left to the
time when it arises.
"The United States, in behalf of each
territory in question, and so long as it
shall continue under its protection, should
adopt proper measures for securing out
of tjie revenues of these countries, the
establishment of free, elementary, unsec
tarian schools, sufficient for the instruc
tion of all persons of school age.
"We count the present an auspieous
time for the establishment by the United
States of a graded diplomatic and con
sular service.
"We heartily approve of the principle
of arbitration in the settlement of Inter
national difficulties and urge that its
largest practicable application be supplied
by treaties of arbitration.
""We cordially favor the precedent set
by President McKlnley in refusing at the
beginning of the war to grant letters of
marque and reprisal, and we recommend
that In the pence to be concluded between
the United States and Spain the practic
ing of privateering be forever prohibited;
also that provision be made, as foreshad
owed by the Government of the United
States in refusing to sign the declaration
of Paris in 1556, for the exemption from
capture of private property at sea. in ac
cordance with the enlightened sentiments
of mankind."
Chairman Henry "Wade Rogers and
Secretary Ralph W. Eastly of Chicago
and the committee of twenty-one were
instructed to present the resolutions
to President McKlnley and his Cabinet
for their consideration. The conven
tion to-night adjourned subject to the
call of Chairman Rogers.
MRS. BOTKIN INDIGNANT.
Resents Reports in Connection With
the Dunning Murder.
STOCKTON, Aur. 20.â Mrs. W. A.
Botkin showed considerable indigna
tion this evening when a report reached
her that an effort was b?ing made to
bring about her arrest in connection
with the death of Mr?*. J. P. Dunning
her sister at Dover, Del. She said
the threats of arrest did not perturb
her In the least. She answered with
evident readiness all questions concern
ing her acquaintance with Mr. Dun
ning. She said she knew Mr. Dunning
had been financially emb;uras<<.cd and
was much interested in the races. She
knew of no female friend whom Dun
ning made much over and declared she
was absolutely in the dark as to who
could have had any motive in bringing
about the death of Mrs. Dunning and
her Bister.
Beverly Botkin, her son, was an inti
mate acquaintance of Dunning. He
said he was responsible for intioducinsj
Dunning into his family, but declared
he knt w nothing that could thro>v m>
more light on Dunning's life than has
already been published.
Botkin senior was very Indignant
over the imputations cast upon his
wife by recent reports and declares
that she has been prostrated through
the notoriety which has overtaken her
through a mere acquaintance with
Dunning. The lady has kept close in
doors for the past two days and has
spent most of her time with a lady
friend.

MAY INCITE
A GREAT WAR
Russia's Aggression Is
Deemed Dangerous.
HER DIPLOMACY BUNGLING
A JAPANESE STUDENT MAKES A
FORECAST.
The Czar's Attitude in China May-
Plunge the World Into a
Great and Bloody-
Struggle.
One of the men best Informed concerning
the relationship of Japan with America
and other powers of the globe is Masu
Miyakawa of this city, who is an inter
pret* of English and a contractor of
Japanese labor in America, -with his prin
cipal office of business at 410 Kearny
street. At a gathering of a number of
American students, lawyers and local
statesmen at his apartments last even
ing, the gentleman was called upon for
- line remarks. They were considered im
portant by the company, in view of the
present complications in the Orient.
Among other things he said:
â¢â 1 believe that Japan is the natural
ally of America, not only on account of
ial position, but for other rea
vrhich have come to light since the
unprecedented progress of the empire
since we have let the light of other civil
izations Into our country. It will be the
Great Britain of Asia.
"If Japan should have trouble with
Russia we would certainly stand a show
In a physical contest with the Czar, if
not In a diplomatic war. At the termina
tion of the Ohino-Japanese war Germany
: a bailing part in the diplomatic
the i 'zar 'occupying purely an or
namental place m the stage settings. In
his sell-importance and lack of judg
ment the Czar had planted the most o.f
his. military power in Asiatic Russia, at
great expense to his people, leaving West
ern Kusr-ia weak and comparatively un
protected, while Germany was alive tp the
on, and under the guise of friendly
interposition caused the retrocession of
the Liau-Tong Peninsula, which is a pos
n purchased by the lives and blood
of Japanese. By her alleged good offices
Russia has earned nothing ~ut the dt ep
est enmity of the Japanese, and has given
signal advantages to her neighbor. Ger
many, by evacuating the important
guards of W. stern Russia. Then the
Czar sought to encroach upon the penin
sula of Corea, which he abandoned, how
ever, after the expenditure of much
money, for the evident fear of a formal
protest from Japan.
"To add to the insults heaped upon our
race and nation came the crowning act
when the autocrat of all the Russias was
crowned. Our representatives and those
of some other Governments were treated
with much discourtesy, whicn is remem
"Now it is the evident intention of Rus
sia to lay her hand upon China. Her for
mer deficient diplomacy shows that she
may make such a blundering attempt.
"If she does, then will come such a war
as the world has never known. It will
involve England, Russia. Ormnny and
China and Japan, witn possibly the T nit
ed States and France. 1 tel. you gentle
men there is a menacing outlook and ) a
.situation to try the souls of statesmen.
Mr Miyakawa was an official interpre
ter in the Chino-Japane.se war, and was In
several battles. He speaks several lan
jruaees and has been a dilierent student of
political economy all his life. Hence there
is a value attached to his opinions.

FOB AN ELECTRIC LINE.
Efforts to Have One Run Through
the Wholesale District.
The Merchants' Association has taken
up the question of an improved streetcar
service for Montgomery street and the
wholesale district between Montgomery
street and the ferries. At the present
time there is no direct connection between
this part of the city and the upper retail
districts except by means of horse cars
which are very unsatisfactory.
It has been suggested that the Sixth
street line be turned into an electric line
and run up Sixth to Market and Taylor;
up Taylor to Post; down Post to Mont
gomery; down Montgomery to Jackson;
along- Jackson to Bansome. and up San
some to Market. This line, with proper
transfers, will accommodate several parts
of the city which at present receive very
inadequate service.
To ascertain whether puch a line would

houses along Montgomery street and in
the adjacent wholesale quarter, the Mer

an electric line und whether the route
sup-bested meets with their approval.
To Preserve Smooth Streets.
Some time ago the Supervisors passed
an ordinance which prohibits draymen
and teamsters from driving their teams
with one set of wheels in the car tracks
and the other pet on the pavement, thus
wearing deep ruts in the street*. Desir
ing to secure the co-operation of. the dray
men, teamsters and drivers of various de
livery wagons, in the matter of keeping
the smooth streets in good condition, the
Merchants' Association has sent com
munlcattons to over 100 draymen and
tfumsters in the city and has also ad
dressed a letter to the Draymen and
Teamsters' Union asking it to officially
communicate with its members and to
urge them to interest themselves in the
matter of preserving the thoroughfares.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 21, 1308.
THE PAGO PAGO
COALING STATION
Naval Engineer Here to
Supervise.
LIEUT. CHAMBERS SECRETIVE
BIDS TO BE RECEIVED AT WASH
INGTON.
Former Call for Tenders Made in
1892, but the Project Was
Dropped â Revived by the
War With Spain.
It seems pretty definitely settled that
the naval authorities at Washington are
about to take steps to Improve the coal
i ing- station which the United States has
owned at Pago Pago harbor, in Samoa,
for the past twenty years. Bids have
I been called for the construction of a
i wharf and other conveniences for coaling
on the spot, though no deta. - have as
yet reached this coast.
A visible and t: gible evidence of the
President's Intentions is, however, now
staying at the Occidental. F. T. Cham
bers, who ranks as a lieutenant in the
Civil Engineering Department of the
| navy, came over frorr Mare Island a day
br two ago and is engaged upon., some
! mysterious business in connection with
| the contract. His secrecy is to be com
pared only to that of the deep sea. He
confesses, by the way, that he ivad some
thing about Apia before he left Washing
ton, but he declines to admit any knowl
edge of Pago Pago. Lieutenant Ciiam
| bers is a very young man, with a very
big trunk, which blocks up half his tiny
j bedroom at the Occidental, but he has
i had a great deal of practical experience
! in altering and reconstructing the New
j York Navy Yard. He is skilled in the
matter of docks and wharves, and knows
i all about the driving of piles and the
< construction of piers, so that he is Just
! the man to supervise the operations in
Samoa.
"1 do not know anything about the
| bids for this work," he said yesterday.
"Tney will bu caiied for and accepted in
Washington. I presume the specifications
will be placed at the disposal of intend
ing contractors, so that they may have
ample time to prepare their estimates. I
cannot say whether it is the intention of
the naval department to fortify Pago
Pago harbor or not."
John Wightman of the firm â ? Wight
man Bros, knows a good deal more about
1 the matter. "I have had a previous ex
! perience," he remarked. "In December,
1892 bids were called fur the construction
of a wharf at Pago Pago, and 1 presume
i vie work now proposed is to be carried
out on similar lines.
"The specifications caiied for the con
i Ftruction of a lons wharf, running out
; over the reef Into deep water. The piles
j were to 1" J "f Iron, with screw flanges,
! and the decking of wood. Now the
1 trouble was that these Bcrew piles, with
â  flanges three feefln diameter, were quite
unsuitable for sinking through the coral
rock, which has in reality solidified into
limestone. We proposed to get over the
difficulty by blasting out holes for the
piles, and afterward tilling up the sr^ce
with concrete. In all seven tenders were

: others ranged as high is $140,000. The low

Bponsible party, and represented about
the cost of the material on board ship
"We could have carried out the con
; tract successfully, and, in fact, we had

already paid down our deposit of $5000.
Then for some reason which Still remains
unknown, the department dropped the
project altogether, and after a delay of
about a month the deposit was returned.
Mr Wightman does not think that the
construction of such an expensive wharf
is at all necessary, and believes that a
light wooden wharf would answer all
coaling requirements. ThiÃ could be put
up for a few thousand dollars, and as
there is deep water close in to the reef
vessels could come alongside the dock
with perfect safety. "As to the question
Of fortifying Pago Pago harbor,"
tinued Mr. Wightman, "the idea 1p out
of the question, because the United States
has no more right to erect defenses there
than Phe has at Hongkong or Jamaica.
The Washington treaty of 1878, which has
been frequently quoted of late, merely
gives the United States the right to use
Pago Pago harbor as a naval base and to
erect a coaling station on the shore there
of There is nothing to prevent any other
powers establishing coaling stations at
Pago Pago if they wished to do so. The
assumption that because the United
States has purchased fifteen acres of land
on the shores of the harbor she has there
fore the right to fortify the entrance is
absurd. Any such action would be a di
rect broach of the Berlin treaty of 1889. by
which the Samoan group is placed under
the joint control of England, Germany
and the United States. If this country
wished to fortify Pago Pago harbor she
would have as a preliminary step to an
nex the island of Tutuila, and so acquire
territorial rights. Such a proceeding could
only be managed by diplomatic arrange
ments, and neither Germany nor England
would be likely to give their consent."
/HEIR RELATIONS A TTTSTERY.
An Old Man and Young Girl Aban
don a Tiny Infant.
A case In which there is a little element
of mystery has recently had the attention
of the officers of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to.Children. A few nights
ago a young girl was taken to Christ's
Rescue Mission at 948 Mission street by a
man about 50 years of â¢ age, who claimed
to be her father. That night a child was
born, and a couple of days after the old
man took the girl away and left the baby
at the mission, abandoned. The only name
that Mrs. Prescott of the society named
could get was Maggie Mosier. Since then
the police have been asked to help find
the man and the girl, but so far nothing
has been heard of them. "*.'â¢â¢ * .
The description of the couple tallies
with- that of two persons, called to the
attention of Mrs. Present* Bix months
ago. A young girl went to work . on â¢- a
ranch near Pleasanton, and. she. was often
visited' by a man of about 50 years, who
asserted "that he was her father, but the
people on the farm concluded that if such
was the relationship the officers of the
law should be Informed. The girl, upon
being questioned, became frightened and
fled with the old man on the first train
bound for this city. The *"'â¢'- ,
fleers have been hunting for the two ever
since but only learned of their presence

WEALTHY, BUT A VAGRANT.
Peter Cunningham, an Old Miser, Gathered Meat and
Bread From the Gutters.
âº Peter Cunningham, an old miser, was convicted of vagrancy by Judge
âº Conlan yesterday, although he has $."1,539 on deposit in six banks and
â  is the owner of real estate in the city and a ranch in the country. He
- was arrested last Tuesday night on Bush and Sansome streets by Pollce
- man Tom Langford, who committed suicide the following night, and Spe
â  cial Officer Rowland. Several officers testified in court yesterday that Cun
â¢ ning-ham was in the nightly habit of visiting swill barrels in the rear of
- hotels, bakeries and saloons and picking out pieces of meat and bread,
which he took tn his home at 31G Davis street. When arrested several
â¢ scraps were fo;;nd in his pockets. He and an old beggar had been seen
â  to run a race to get first to a swill barrel. Special Officer Rowland
said that on one ocasion he had given his dog a juicy leg. of mutton to
â¢ eat and Cunningham had taken it from the dog. He was also in the
â¢ habit of going along the streets in the daytime and picking up odd
things
Cunningham, in his own defense, denied that he purloined stuff from
swill barrels, but he appeared to know something about whether they
were boxes or barrels, and that some of them were locked. He produced
six bank books, showing that he had. as he said, about Jitt.OOO on deposit.
He admitted that he very frequently took some meat and bread that a
Chinese employed in a saloon on Front and California streets used to
leave nt the foot of a palm tree in front of the saloon for newsboys.
Judge Conlan said it was one of the worst cases that had come before
him. If a poor man had taken meat and bread out of swill barrels,
there would be some excuse for him but there was no excuse for the
defendant, who. although a wealthy man, was. In his opinion, "an in
veterate bum." It was not necessary that a man should be a drunkard
or an associate of known thieves to be a vagrant, and he had no hesita
tion !n saying that the acts of the defendant constituted him, in the eyes
of the law, a vagrant. He would convict him of the charge and order
him Into custody to appear for sentence to-morrow morning.
Cunningham was was up on a similar charge before the late Judge
Campbell in February last, and the case was dismissed. He was therefore
considerably taken aback by the judgment of Judge Conlan, and in
structed his attorney to appeal the case. He had given his attorney, E. S.
Comyns. his bank books, but later insisted upon their being given into
the custody of the police
"I am not a vagrant," said Cunningham when seen in the City
Prison, "and this is a job on the part of the police. I have lived here since
1856. and should be allowed to live my own way. Ido not need to work,
as I have plenty of money, which I honestly earned. I was born in the
west of Ireland and am a jeweler by trade. I worked for Tiffany in New
York before coming here, and worked for some of the leading jewelers in
this city. I speculated in stocks and was successful, and then I gave up
work. I have an elder brother living with me and'have relatives In the
country. I suppose they call me an old miser, but that is none of their
business."
THE TRUE STORY OF
THE KIEL INCIDENT
YELLOW LIES ANNOY ADMIRAL
KIRKLAND'S FAMILY.
A Story Set Afloat by Unreliable
Journals and Unfortunately
Resurrected by a Bio
grapher.
I The published biography of the late Ad
! miral Kirkland has given credence to a
i story set afloat by yellow journals, which,
i as usual, proves to be entirely untrue. ItÂ«
revival at this time has Increased the sad
i ness of Mrs. Kirkland, and at her request
the following correct story of the Kiel in
cident is forwarded to The Call by an
officer, who relates it Just as it was told
i to him by the admiral on the day he
drove the first rivet of the battle-shin
: Wisconsin. Naval regulations forbid the
â  author to sign the statement, but his po
; sition alone is sufficient guarantee of the
I authenticity of his story, ft is as follows:
When a foreign sovereign visits a ship of the
United States navy he is received with honors
sinillar with those prescribed for receiving the
rre.ldent of the -United States; all officers as
femble in social full dresa on the quarter
deck the admiral and captain meet him at
the gangway, ruffles are beaten on the drum.
the busle sounds four, flourishes, the crew
mans the rail and numerous other ceremonies
Â£cCr, all for the purpose of showing the great
est possible honor to the chief executive of a
friendly nation. Such ceremonies do not oc
cur without due official notice of the expected
i V While Admiral Kirkland was In command of
the United States fleet at Kiel during the
I naval rendezvous of 1894. his Â«***&.Â«Â« New
! York, commanded by captain Bob I^ari*.
i was visited three times by the German Em
â  peror. The first visit was purely official, and
i any rudeness or disrespect on the part of the
1 admiral at such a time was: quite impossible.
; That It did not occur is shown by the tact
1 that the second visit was semi-official, the Em
peror then coming to dine at the admiral s per
sonal Invitation. It is not possible that the lat
ter could be rude, or disrespectful when ' pre
siding at his own table and entertaining so
celebrated a guest. That this did not occur.
and that the admiral performed his duties as
a host in an entertaining and charming man
ner to the Emperor's entire gratification, is
shown by the fact that the dinner party did
not break up until after midnight. It was then
that the famous Incidents occurred of arous
in the sleeping crew without warning, to
close watertight doors and couple the forward
engines These drills were executed so prompt
ly and efficiently that the Emperor expressed
his admiration in the highest terms. -
The third visit was a conclusive proof of the
Kmperor's personal Rood will toward the ad
miral. This time It was unofficial, na his
coming was entirely unexpected. A small
steam-launch" came alongside the gangway
and several officers started to come on. board
â  the flagship. It was only .then that the Em
peror in fatigue uniform, was observed to be
among them. Naturally the admiral was at
once informed, and all necessary orders were
quickly issued to receive the distinguished
guest with the honors due him. but he quickly
' requested that all ceremonies be . omitted ;as
' his visit was merely a personal one to the ad
' miral and taking the . latter' arm moved
I toward the cabin. After some conversation
i there, "he 'â  took the admiral aside and offered
i him. as a souvenir, a magnificent .gold snuff
box containing his miniature on the cover, sur
rounded by diamonds. Upon the admiral's
paying that his country's laws did not permit

Miller yesterday afternoon and serioiisly
l>f>aU-n over the head with a club. Mil
ler, who formerly worked for Friodhof
fer visited his shop, and picking up a
long club, vainly endeavored to brain
him.

the attention of .several citizens who wÂ»nt
to Friedhoffer'a assistance. Miller, evi
dently fearing: arrest, took to UN heels
and disappeared down Third sireet.
Frlf-dhoffer was taken to iis home and
a doctor summoned. An examination dls
closed t^iat ho had sustained a severe
scalp wound and an abrasion of the face.
The lnju~fed man says that Miller recent

dence of being mentally irresponsible he
d scharged him. Since then he has been
hanging around the blacksmith shop, evi
dently awaiting an opportunity to get
even with the proprietor.

WHEAT MARKETS OF
THE WORLD ARE DULL
CONDITIONS THAT CBEATE A
FOREBODING OUTLOOK.
Bussia Is Underselling America and
an Immense Crop Is Now Being
Harvested â Barley Prices
Are Shrinking.
Wheat speculation during the past
week was more active than for several
weeks previous. The- heavy short inter
est which had crept into September, to
gether with a most urgent demand for
spot, was a potent factor in establish
ing a strong marketâ beginning on Tues
day and continuing until Thursday. Re
ceipts at primary points were very much
smaller than the same period last year.
Kansas City reported millers paying 5%
cents premium for No. 2 red, over Sep
tember prices. Detroit reported coun
i try offerings rapidly decreasing, with
millers' wants urgent. Some rain in the.
Northwest at harvest time was another
bullish factor. These conditions kept
shorts in abeyance until more disposi
tion was shown upon the part of farm
ers to part with their wheat.
On Friday foreigners withdrew offers
sent to American exporters, and replac
ed them with Russian exporters, whose
prices were from 4 to 6 cents under
America. Adrled to this came heavy
marketing of spring wheat, causing a
marked break in the Minneapolis and
Duluth markets, which was reflected in
winter wheat centers. This resulted in
starting to market a large volume of
wheat at winter wheat points.
Indications point to heavy deliveries for
some time to come. There is compara
tively DO foreign demand. Producers
must therefore depend upon home buy
ers to a greater extent this crop year than
usual. Crops abroad promise well, in
many instances exceeding those of anj
! previous year. Russia has shown much
; alertness in contracting for delivery
ahead of America. The conditions this
season are completely reversed from
those of last year. There is as much of
an overproduction as there was a sup
posed shortage last year. There is not
likely to be an "angel" in the market this
season. The wings cost Letter too much
for any one else to try the game.
A good milling demand will continue.
Elevator interests will buy when there
iis any chance of earning carrying
charges. At present the market offers
this element of support no inducements,
as spot wheat continues at a premium
over futures. It is not likely this condi
tion will continue after receipts increase
| and millers' demands are fairly satisfied.
The closing price on Saturday of Sep
tember and December wheat in the Chi
cago market was at the lowest points
reached on the present crops, with indi
cations of a further decline, unless farm
ers' deliveries are suddenly checked, in
which case a temporary rally would re
sult, lasting only until a freer move
ment of wheat begins again.
The fact is too plainly visible that there
| is plenty of wheat in the country. Sooner
or later it must find its way to market.
Wheat prices in the local market ex
perienced a heavy decline during the
week, December selling at 116 on Sat
urday. Favorable harvesting conditions
throughout Oregon and Washington and
prospects of free deliveries caused longs
' to unload. Shorts were the only support
! afforded the market. This support is
! never more than momentary. Wheat
! generally burns through a short if no
! rallying circumstances are at hand.
j Short lines bought in were repeatedly
i put out again, even at reduced prices.
1 Around 112 December wheat ought to be
| good property, temporarily at least.
Barley has been fairly active at lower
prices, the big break in corn and wheat
affecting a weakening tendency. Hold
ers of barley in Washington and Ore
gon are showing more disposition to sell.
The low price of wheat will admit of sub
stituting that cereal for barley as feed.
The demand for consumption has fallen
off to nothing. There is a great deal of
lung barley held by local commission
houses for country account. Should this
barley come into the market a bad break
would result. The tendency of prices
seenip decidedly downward. WÂ«ll inform
ed brokers believe December barley will
sÂ°ll at 95. R. E. MULCAHV.

Returned From Alaska.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 20.â Edward J. Simon
of this city has returned from St. Mich
ael, and does not bring a very encourag
ing account of the prospects in Alaska.
He was on the river steamer James Eva,
wh}ch was being towed up by the Na
tional City, and had a narrow escape
when she went to pieces. He lost all his
outfit and barely escaped with his life.
He found St. Michael crowded with dis
gusted men, and. concluded that the best
thing he could do was to come back
home, returning on the same vessel which
rescued him from the wrecked Eva.

The advertisement canvasser for a St. Louis daily paper says of
Ripans Tabules': â  " Ever since I can . remember I have been troubled
with constipation in its severest form. ; So J acute, in fact, at times, as
to produce -dreadful headaches that, notwithstanding all the outdoor :
work afforded me by my vocation, and the latitude it 'allowed me .to â¢
test my pedestrian abilities â which is supposed ;to be -a successful ;
manner of displacing constipationâ l was very often compelled to '
forego my pursuit of 'business.' Constipation with me seemed to
be â¢ hereditary rather thau due :. to accidental causes, therefore mii cfa : -,
â  harder to relieve. In my extremity I often resorted to most drastio'
measures, but found .ho cure to be permanent; In 1892, while con- ;
nected with the Times of El ; Paso, Tex., Ripans Tabules were brought '
to my notice, and I used them with marked success. Nowadays I
never suffer from such severe cases of ' constipation, and the violent ' ;
headaches I formerly experienced never worry me in the least; Some- ;
times, though," when 'I allow myself to â  lapse for a period into irreg- '

A BIG GARRISON AT HONOLULU.
All Remaining Expeditionary Forces to Be Sent
at Once to the Islandsâ General Merriam
Sails TMs Morning.
Major General Merriam, commanding the Department of California,
which now includes the Hawaiian Island-, sails for Honolulu this morning
on the steamer Arizona. His departure at this time is somewhat unex
pected, as he had not Intended to visit the islands until after the forward-
Ing of all the Philippine expeditionary forces that were to be sent to
Manila; but yesterday afternoon he received instructions from the War
Department to have all the expeditionary forces remaining in San Fran
cisco transported to Honolulu, there to await further orders. This dis
patch came as a complete surprise, and General Merriam at once concluded
to sail on the Arizona In advance of the troops, in order to prepare for
their reception and care while they are stationed there. The shipment of
these troops will leave but a mere handful of soldiers in San Francisco.
General â¢Merriam, who embarked on the Arizona last evening, said:
"This sudden and unexpected turn in affairs necessitates my Imme
diately going to Honolulu to have matters properly arranged for the expe
ditionary forces which are to be sent from San Francisco as soon as possi
ble on t,he transports City of Sydney, the Australia and the City of
Peking. The expeditionary forces remaining here after the departure of
the Scandia on Wednesday next for Manila will consist of the Seventh
California, the Fifty-first lowa, the First Tennessee, the Twentieth Kan
sas-all full regimentsâ and the California Heavy Artillery, 400 men, under
Major Rice. These are the troops that are to go to Honolulu. How long
they will remain there is something that I can't answer. Honolulu will be
a Bert of half-way station. The supplies will have to be transported from
San Francisco. The necessity of a cable to Honolulu will now be demon
strated, and I am of the opinion that this n.ove .will have considerable ef
fect In hastening cable commimication with our new territory, which, has
now teoome so important a midocean station. Should more troops be
needed for Manila it will be seen that a ditpatch-boat would have to be
sent to Honolulu, and therefore the removal of the troops to that port,
while placing them nearer the Philippines, will not get them to Manila any
sooner than If they had remained in San Francisco.
"The move.no doubt, will be appreciated by the men, who have become
restless and impatient owing to Inactivity, and the change of scene and
climate will do them good. I am under the impression that this movement
is the result of the efforts of influential friends of the various regiments
who desired to have the wishes of the men for some active service gratified.
Whether they ever will see active campaign service Is problematical. That
depends upon the course of events in the Philippines.
"The Arizona and Scandia could not carry a full complement of sol
diers, as we had to make room for extra supplies that were demanded for
Manila I had no orders except to send the troops that have been desig
nated for these two ships, which take less than 2000 soldiers, although
their combined capacity is 3300. I had designated the Seventh California
for the Scandia, but I was suddenly ordered to stop sending any more
troops to General Merritt and to wait for further instructions. I then sug
gested to the War Departmentâ in fact beggedâ that t~e trdÂ«ps needed to
fill the incomplete regiments at Manila be sent forward, together with
needed supplies. The suggestion was approved, and as a result the Ari
zona and Scandia carry the odds and ends of the various organizations,
with a large quantity of supplies. My suggestion that the Scandia be con
verted into a hospital ship upon arriving at Manila was also approved.
That order came on the 16th. ... â  â __
"I understand that great-difficulties will be encountered In finding a
suitable damping ground for the troops at Honolulu. I have received a
letter from Colonel Barber, who says as yet he has been unable to get a
camping ground fit even for a single regiment, owing to the unfavorable
nature of the country in the vicinity of Honolulu. Lieutenant Graves,
who, with Lieutenant Burnett, accompanies me, goes to Honolulu to act
as muster!ng-ln officer of the native Hawaiian troops.
"After the departure of the expeditionary forces for Honolulu there
will remain in San Francisco the First Washington Volunteers and the
Eighth California, neither of which regiments has been assigned to the
Elgnth Army Corps, and the garrison at the Presidio."

freight. Meantime the soldiers occupied
themselves stuffing straw into mattresses
which had been provided for them in ad
dition to those already in the berth:; of the
steamer. The Humboldt carried a year's
supply of provisions for the battery, as
well as an extra Quantity for destitute
men at St. Michael. Another supply of
provisions of over 200 tons will soon follow
the Humboldt on another steamer..
The battery upon reaching St. Michael
will be divided into four detachments.
One detachment will be stationed at St.

THE TENNESSEE RIOT.
Formal Charges Have Been
Preferred Against the Four
Men Under Arrest.
Privates Davis, Clarke and Anderson,
of Company L, and Scruggs of Company
E, First Tennessee Regiment, are the
soldiers who will have to appear before
a court-martial to answer to the charge
of assault upon the person and property
of Dan Thomas. Lieutenant Fowler,
who conducted the investigation, sub
mitted to General Miller yesterday,
through Colonel Smith, the charges lhat
he has preferred against these men. He
only found evidence to implicate the
men named, although more soldiers were
engaged in the riot. The men will be
ordered before a court-martial this veek,
and there is no doubt that they will
be severely punished. Private Scruggs
will have to answer to the separate
charge of assaulting Thomas when he
was in the custody of Major Cheathim.
This charge is the most serious of any
preferred.
Colonel Smith has not yet replied to the
bill of complaint of the Thomas family,
asking for $5000 damages, which was fu'>
mitted to him by General Miller. V/hen
the colonel makes his formal reply, vhich
will be this week, Gener-il Miller Â»â¢ 111

damages.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 20.â A deliberate at
tempt at double murder was made by
John Cohkati upon John Ban and An
tonio Luco this evening about sun
down. Ban will probably die. but Luco
has only a flesh wound. The only rea
son that both were not killed outright
is that the horse attached to the
wagon containing all three men jumped
and deflected the assassin's aim. All
the parties are Slavonians. They have
been at work on the fruit ranch of Dan
Wright in the Willows, not far from
Campbell.
When the men quit work this even
ing they got into a wagon to come to
town. The two men who were shot
took seats in front. The would-be
murderer got up behind. Before they
started Cohkati pulled a big pistol and
fired directly at Ban. The horse jump
ed, but not in time to save the vic
tim, who received a ball in the back be
tween the point of the left shoulder and
the spinal column. Another shot was
taken at Luco, but the jump of the
horse caused the bullet to inflict only a
flesh wound.
A crowd of employes ran up and the
infuriated man emptied his pistol at
them, but hit no one. He escaped and
came to town, where he was arrested in
a Slavonian restaurant. No cause for
the shooting is known.
To-night Ban is reported to be in an
exceedingly dangerous condition and
the physicians -doubt his recovery. He
remains at the ranch, where he was
shot, being cared for by the owner.

When Detected They Attempted to
Escape but Were Too Slow, and
Were Finally Landed in
Prison.
Tillle Fels of 137 Eureka street and
Ella Shearer of 315 Mason street were
arrested last evening by Special Officers
Allen and Green of the Emporium on
Market street and charged with shop
lifting. Two feather boas, two silk
scarfs, a bronzed bust, a bolt of ribbon,
two pairs of gloves and some ladies'
underwear, all of which had been
stolen, were found in their possession.
Both women were well dressed and
had an air of respectability.
Shortly after r o'clock they visited
the Emporium and pretended to be
anxious to purchase some dress goods.
One of the women carried a small
satchel, which could be opened by the
slightest touch of the finger. A female
attache of the store saw them place
the ribbon in the satchel and she at
once notified the floor-walker. The lat
ter started after them and as he was
about to question them they dropped
the satchel containing the stolen arti
cles and ran from the place. Green
and Allen, who are specially employed
to look out for shoplifters, gave chase
and overtaking the women placed them
under arrest.
They begged piteously to be released,
claiming they were respectable women
and had taken the articles "Just for
fun," as one of them expressed it. Not
withstanding their tearful protestations
they were taken to the City Prison in
the patrol wagon and formally charged
with petty larceny.
When asked for an explanation of
their conduct the fair prisoners as
sumed an innocent air and blushingly
demanded to know why they had been
arrested. On being confronted with
the evidence of their guilt they begged
to be released.
"We are both respectable tfrls," re
marked the Feis woman, who is only
20 years of age. "My God, what will
our parents say?"
She. however, persistently refused to
state why she and her companion had
stolen the articles.
"We did not" need them," she rather
pitifully remarked; "both Ella and I
have the same articles at home."
Subsequently the Feis woman ad
mitted that her companion had stolen
the articles, but she declared that she
knew nothing about it until they were
arrested.
FIENDISH CRIMES OF
A GEORGIA NEGRO
Brutally Murders Two Women and a
Manâ Strung Up and Biddled
With Bullets.
MACON, Ga., Aug. 20.â A special to the
Telegram from Mercurlus, Ga., says: Th*
most fiendish crime in the history of
Sumter County, or the wuole State, was
committed at Friendship, twelve miles
west of here, last night.
Mrs. James McGarray and her son,
James Byrne, were murdered by a negro
with an ax while they were in their beds.
After this double murder the fiend caught
a negro woman, tied tier to a tree in the
woods and mutilated her in a shocking
manner. She died, but not until she had
told the murderer's name.
The woods and fields for miles about
were scoured by a posse, many negroes
joining in the chase for the murderer. In
the meantime, it Is said, the negro woman
who was found tied in the woods and mal
treated made a statement as to the guilty
negro and pointed out as the culprit one
of the most diligent in the search of the
supposed criminal. After thoroughly sat
isfying themselves of his guilt, the black
brute was strung up and his body riddled
with bullets.

KILLED IN A
DANCE HULL
James Burns Shot by
William Harrison.
WAS PROBABLY AN ACCIDENT
THE MEN HAVE BEEN CLOSE
FBIENDS FOR YEARS.
Police Sergeant Duke Kept Harrison
at an Outside Sta ion Until It
Was Too Late for Burns
to Identify Him.
James Burns, a painter, was shot and
killed in the dressing-room of a dance
hall at Masonic avenue and Geary streets
by William Harrison, another painter, at
a late hour last night.
The two men were attending the regu
lar nightly dance, and, according to the
story told by Harrison, the killing was
altogether accidental. He says that he
and Burns have been friends for a long
time, and while they were talking in the
hatroom he took out a revolver belong
ing to a friend, which he had taken out
of pawn for him, when Burns grabbed it.
The gun was loaded and in the scuffle it
was discharged, the bullet striking Burns
in the abdomen. He was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, but died In about two
hours.
The police will in all probability be
compelled to take Harrison's statement,
owing to the actions of Sergeant Duke, j
who kept Harrison, whom he had arrest
ed, locked in a cell at the O'Farrell police
station instead of taking him to the hos
pital to be identified and confronted by
the dying man. Duke was told of his
mistake by Sergeant Nash, and he thrn
hurried to make amends for his blunder,
but when he reached the hospital with
his prisoner the victim of the shooting
was dead.
The two men wore alone in the room
when the shooting took place, and they
were both under the influence of liquor.
From the information that the police
could gather last night the officers are
of the opinion that the shot was the ro-
Eult of a drunken, playful scuffle, with
a dangerous weapon for a toy.
A Noted Mine-Owner Dead.
John Perschbaocker, who was taken to ,
the Harbor Hospital Wednesday after a
paralytic stroke, died yesterday evening.
Mr. Perschbaecker owned the Napoleon
group of mines in Mexico, and was the
discoverer and original owner of the fa
mous Perschbaecker mine at Magalia. in
Butte County. He was 75 years old and.
leaves a widow and daughter, residing at
760 Telegraph avenue, Oakland, and a son
who is managing the mines in Mexico.

SPECULATOR ERNEST TERAH
IIOOLEY has just completed his
meteoric career In London, and
is now in the insolvent's court
trying to explain how he made
his colossal fortune, how it was lost and
vl-ier:? his creditors had best look for
remnants.
â¢â¢.In less than three years by daring
speculations he transformed his few
thousand dollars into $50,000,000. The
m-thods of ordinary speculators are
dwarfed to those of petty per cent
sharpers when compared to the mag
nlfice-nt ways in which Hooley raked in
niiiiioiis of pounds sterling. London,

. bribery, over-capitalization and un

fkvrucket career is now at the close,

pefers and financial papers with large
sums of money. These two features

He was not consnicuous in the com
mercial life of the town. He. paid his
debts, made a reasonable profit on his
lace, minerled little in the political or
social life of the place, but dreamed.
In ordinary conversation your Amer
ican will class the French or the Span
ish as the greatest gambling nations of
Europe. This is absolutely wrong. The
greatest gambling nation of Europe,
and for that matter of the wqrld, Is
Mother England. The disease in Eng
land largely takes the form of stock
speculation. The greater the iridescent
Stock rainbow that can be projected In
England the more certain the rich re
ward for the projector. Hooley himself
knew this when in 1895 he made the
first move which brought him to where
he is to-day.
To Julian Ralph he eaid: "I have al
ways gone in for big things. If you go
halfway up the ladder you will find it
crowded with competitors. If you go
to the top you practically have the field
to yourself. There are plenty of men
ready to deal in thousands, but they
pet frightened when you talk of mil
lions."
He went to the top, and from his
dizzy eminence beckoned to the mad
throng of peers, financiers, merchants,
clerks, bookkeepers, half-crazy women
and working people beneath to follow
him. They saw him perched in the sun
light of gold and tried to climb, throw
ing* their wealth ahead of them at his
feet. But the foundation was bad; the
fatal overbalance came, and then the
tumble.
Hoc-ley's name was added to that of
Jabez Balfour, Baron Grant, Colonel
North and the late Davenport Dunn,
gentleman.
Fifty million dollars is the Interest
for one year at 5 per cent on $1,000,000,
000 In the three years of 1895, 1896
and 1897 Hooley, in one form or an
other and with a capital of leso than
$250,000 to begin with, made $50,000,000.
That sober, staid England should not
have appreciated that this sort of thing
is a human impossibility, save that one
is a born scoundrel, passes comprehen
sion. The memories of the South Sea
bubble of Law, of Louisiana and the
Mississippi venturee of Argentina and
the nitrate beds were valueless.
Hooley first tried his speculative hand
at home. He had been working at his
factory sixteen hours a day. He was
so close a business man that he would
not drink nor smoke during working
hours, which, after all, is a big loss of
decent pleasure. He always went to
bed at 10 o'clock and rose early in the
morning, "just to be in front of every
body else," as he puts it. His income
w:ip large enough to make his life a
comfortable one for all his days.
It would not do. He tried the Not
tingham stock market for a few
months and cl >ared $100,000. Then he
said au revoir to his laces and went to
London, unknown, but surcharged with
nerve. He came Into Capel court, the
Wall Ftreft of England, one morning
and engaged offices. He was ready then
10 paralyse every financier in the king
dom, and he did it.
The pneumatic tire craze is much
stronger in England than in this coun
try. One of the great tire companies
of the countr. has been the Dunlop
Pneumatic Tire Company. The finan
cial standing of the instit tion was fair
and its business good. Hooley called
upon its officers and said that he was
prepared to purchase the entire com
pany â what was the price?
The answer wasâ slo,ooo,ooo. Hooley
asked for a week's option at that price
and it was gtfven to him. In the mean
time he had secured the friendship of
ERNEST TERAH HOOLEY, WHO MADE $50,000,000 AND IS NOW BANKRUPT.
Speculator Hoolev made $50,000,000 in London in less than three years. Now he is bankrupt. He was raised in

years of age. If he is married, London journals have failed to reveal it, or whether he is of English or other ex
traction, lie was worth when he camf to London less than a quarter of a million dollars. He is of medium heip-ht,
slender, dark of complexion, quick in speech and more quick in decision. He made Londoners stare at the rapidity
with which he closed business deals. His education has been only moderate; his manners are those of a "pood
fellow." He uresses very quietly, nnd says he is more fond of the breeding of cattle and sheep than of anything
else that he knows of. He has no favorite author or musician. He smokes occasionally and drinks with moderation.
He asserts that he bribed English noMemen and London newspapers to the extent of nearly three-quarters of a mil
lion to support his stock companies.
certain newspapers and journalists and
also the acquaintance of various capi
talists. He called on them to aid him
In the purchase of the company, guar
anteeing handsome profits in return.
l"\vo days after the option had been
given him he had $10,000,000 subscribed
and purchased the company; on the
third day he sold it to his associates
for $20,r00,000, and pocketed $10,000,000
as his profit.
In the transaction, it is stated, Hoo
ley was not called upon to put his
hand in his pocket for a single shilling.
London was staggered at the ease
with which Hooley manipulated the
Dunlop deal. Everybody wanted tire
stock. The most sober-minded Eng
lishman saw all the world on bicycles
equipped with Dunlop tires. Hooley
said it must be so, and Hooley was the
new Midas come to turn all things com
monplace into gold.
The next move of the magician was
to convince investing Englishmen that
every man, woman and child in crea
tion was hungry for Bovril. The stuff
is a beef extract which had been enor
mously advertised abroad for years,
and for which there was a healthy de
mand. Hooley obtained a three-day
option on the company at $2,500,000. The
next morning he sold the company out
right to his friends and the gulls for
$5,000,000. Aladdin never did more won
derful things than this. Dunlop and
Bovril stock went sky high on the stock
exchange. Clerks, small tradesmen,
little fellows that never had a penny,
but wise enough to follow Hooley,
speculated in these stocks and became
rich in a night. Old financiers who
shook their heads and would not follow
him were ruined in a day. He was
financial master of Cape! court and
England. Reporters dogged his heels
to note every doing. Dukes and lords
hobnobbed with him. Apparently he
played with them as if they were pup
pets.
Bicycle manufacturers in England
Just about this time (1896) were at a
standstill in their work because of
lack of tubes. The manufacturers of
tubes could not keep up with the de
mand. Hooley announced that he was
prepared to float the stock of a com
pany which would furnish England and
all the world with any quantity of
tubes. He called the concern the Swe
dish Tube Company and located its
works at Coventrj'. He placed the
capital stock at $3,000,000, and in a
week's time had subscriptions for three
times that amount. The company be
gan operations and paid fair profits for
a time.
Had Hooley stopped here, already
worth $30,000,000, it is possible that his
enterprises (Dunlop, Bovril and the
Swedish works) would have gone on
decently well and that he would have
kept for himself an honored name. But
he either completely lost his head, as
did Barney Barnato, or he could not
control the yellow streak of cheap dis
play in his nature. He had English
stock buyers by the throat, but seemed
unable, now that he was on top, to
keep the grip tight.
Public curiosity could not satisfy it
self as to where he gained his power.
In business he was associated with the
Earl of Delawarr, with Winchelsea,
Lord Deerhurst, Warwick and other
famous men of the nobility. They in
troduced him right and left and their
simple recognition of him gave him a
tremendous prestige with the common
people of the land. With all the
growth of radicalism in England your
Johnny Bull still thinks the seat of all
virtue is to be fÂ«iund in that decaying
bulwark known as the House of Lords.
Englishmen still revere nobility even
if there is nothing in it but shell. Hoo
ley's adroit companionship with men
of blood and name helped him tremen
dously. But how did he do it?
He continued to float rÂ»w business
schemes, and the simple attachment of
his name to their kites made investors
far and wide believe in their security.
He was traveling the path of Barney
Barnato and the Kaffir shares, but no

He announced that he would become

the seat of llkeston Division of Derby

Sir Walter Foster. The latter Is a

be safe for that party by 900 votes.

his financial troubles had not come
upon him at this time.
Hooley has always said that he be
lieved he would yet be one of the Cab- I
met Ministers of England. To help
that belief along he sought the Parlia
mentary seat. First he gave up his
offices in Capel Court, discharged his
clerks, and took rooms at the Midland
Hotel, which cost him $1500 per week.
There three secretaries were in attend
ance on him from 8 in the morning till
10 at night. He transacted almost as
much business in bed as out of it.
He sent for the London reporters and
gave them this interview, announcing
his candidacy:
"You see. my position is a little bet
ter than it was in my early days, and
naturally I want to do everything I can
for the poor of my old home. (Not
tingham is in Derbyshire.) I should
like to represent my old friejids in Par
liament, and being a resident of Ilkes
ton, and not of Birmingham as Sir
Walter is, I have some advantage over
him. He has said that in a contest he
could beat me by 2000 votes."
Hooley's financial crash cut shor? his
political career before the election.
The court's examination into the af
fairs of Mr. Hooley commenced.^ His
assets were shown to be $1,848,815, and
his liabilities $7,745,355. Ke was made
a witness in court, and his testimony
has thrown a bombshell into London
newspaper an^. nobility circles such as
was never hurled there before. Cleve
land House scandals pale before the
testimony of this man. which if true
makes him none the less ignoble; if
false, brands him as the most gigantic
fraud of the age.
On July 27, on the stand in his own
behalf. Hooley said: "The chief reason
for my failure is that my partner
(Rucker) drew $2,500,000 out of my en-
terprises within two months."
The story in court of how the Dunlop
Tire Company yas formed and floated
is perhaps the most Interesting. Hoo
ley bought the business on April 13,
1596, for 510.000,000. and sold it Just one
month later for $20,000,000. His gross
profits by the transaction were about
$10,000,000. The public clamored for the
shares and subsciibed tho capital many
millions over. The efforts of the Regis
trar in Bankruptcy to ascertain how
he accomplished this wonderful coup
brought out some interesting replies
from Mr. Hooley.
Q.â Were you the promoter of the com
pany? A.â Yes.
Q.â As a company promoter, would you
say what your duties were? A.â Well, I
can hardly answer that.
The Official Receiverâ l hope you will,
Mr. Hooley. It |- a point upon which I
have often tried to obtain information.
I Laughter.]
The Debtorâ Well, the first thing you
have to do is to buy a business and then
you have to sell it again, and then, I
Think, the matter ends.
The Official Receiverâ You prepared the
prospectus? A.â Yes.
Q.â Are you, as the promoter, responsi
ble for the prospectus? A. â I hope not.
[Laughter.]
Q.â Are you responsible for the state
ments made In It? A.â No, I think not.
My solicitor can answer that question
better than I can.
The Registrarâ You cannot put the re
sponsibility on your solicitors. They only
act on Instructions.
The Official Receiverâ Perhaps I am
asking too much.
The Registrarâ l do not think so. I
should like you to proceed. We might get
some useful information. [Laughter.]
The Debtorâ l always think that the
most important part of the prospectus is
the front pa#e. [More laughter.]
And then Mr. Hooley explained that
the names on the front page of the
Dunlop prospectus alone cost him be
tween $450,000 and $'>00,000. Probably
there never before has been so strik
ing: testimony to the value of big
names as bait In winning money from
British investors. Lord Delawarr,
chairman of the board, received $125,000
cash for the use of his name, according
to Mr. Hooley's testimony, and Lord
Albemarle $125,000 more.
Mr. Hooley then took up the Interest
ing item of expense, best described as^
bribing the press. This expenditure in
connection with bringing out the Dun
lop Company amounted to no less than
$317,000! Not one penny of this was
for legitimate advertising, the latter ex
penditure forming a separate item. Mr.
Hooley's laconic description of the us
ual method of press bribery is very
much to the point. This is it:
Q.â ln addition to those shares you
gave what are called in the books "Press
calls on shares?" A.â Tea,

erything said !n the press, and whatever
calls he wanted he had. I do not kno-?r
the names of the papers.
Q.â What do you mean by a "press
call?" A.â lt would be for somebody con
nected with the press?.
Q. â Do you mean they were to have the
right to call upon shares at par?
A.â Yes, and get an allotment. The "press
calls" amounted in this case to Â£76,000.
Q.â Would any call be delivered at less

were given to all the papers as far as I
know. But I can obtain the names of

Mr. Hooleyâ lt was to keep the papers

Q.â There were in addition to these
large payments promotion expenses. What
was that payment of Â£12r>0 to T. Harrison
Davis? A.â l don't know. I don't know
who he is. (Laughter).
Q.â What was he when you made thi3
payment? A.â He contracted to settle all
the little evening papers and pay them to
keep quiet.
Q. â How did you become acquainted
with him? A.â Finch Hatton introduced
me.
Q.â Who is Finch Hatton? A.â Brother

Q.â On the counterfoil of the check you

Q.â What was the second payments of
Â£2000 to T. H. Davis? A.â For the same

the Financial Post i nother. I cannot
recollect any others.
Q.â What was the total amount you paid
to Davis. A.â Â£4250 to settle with all
papers.
The bribery of the financial editor of
the Pall Mall Gazette on Mr. Hooley's
behalf has been the source of great
chagrin to Mr. Astor, the owner of that
paper. - The Pall Mall Gazette won an
enviable reputation two or three years
ago as a fearless and incorruptible
enemy of financial shams and swindles.
The fact that Us financial editor (now
dead) .had been grot at by Mr. Hooley'a
agents only recently came to Mr. Aa
tor's knowledge, and he has not hesi
tated to express his views of the matter
and his opinion of Mr. Hooley and his
associates in very plain language in
the columns of the Pall Mall Gazette.
It was quite superfluous for the offi
cial receiver to ask Mr. Hooley finally
why he paid these large sume to peers
of the realm whom he made directors
of his companies, for the reply was ob
vious:
"I couldn't get them on without."
Hooley has left aristocratic and
financial London in a state bordering
on a panic. Small investors in all
parts of the kingdom are clamoring for
their money in the stock concerns,
while titled men whose sales of their
names have been revealed are scurry
ing away to the Continent for seclu
sion and rest for their shattered nerves.
LONDON. Aug. IS.â ln the Queen's

the hearing of the motion to commit
Earl Delawarr, Messrs. Broadley. Brad

in attempting to induce Ernest Terah
Hooley to falsify the evidence he had
given against them.
Hooley explained the discrepancy be
veen his own statement that he had
Â» aid Earl Delawarr $250,000 and the
j'arl's statement that he had only re
ceived $125,000 by saying that he paid

division between Earl Delawarr and

serted that Earl Delawarr, in the

c?o*nstrued as'an attempt at bribery. It
r-as understood at the same interview
fhat Hooley would be asked to correct
liis original evidence. While on the
stand Bradshaw fainted.
Earl Delawarr acknowledged receiv â¢
ing $40,000 as a gift. # He said that he
subsequently received $7500 and at a
latter date borrowed $50,000. but this
money was not paid him for joining
the directorate. Later, the Earl said,
he was released from this debt by

PRINCE BISMARCK the builder
of the German Empire, died on
July 30, in the eighty-fourth
year of his age. He was born
In Schonhausen in 1815, a few
months before the battle of
Waterloo. He studied law at the uni- .
versities of Goettingen and Berlin, and
â was subsequently elected a member of
the United Diet and became one of the
chief orators of the Junkers, or Con
servative party. His first experience
in diplomacy was in 1851, when he was
Bent to Frankfort as first Secretary of
Legation, with the title of privy coun
selor to the Prussian Embassy. It was
here that he conceived the idea that
Prussia could not fulfill its political
mission in Germany until Austria had
been expelled from the Bund. In 1859
he was sent as Embassador to St.
Petersburg, and before going he made
a visit to Paris for amusement. For
a short time in 1862 he represented
Prussia at Paris.
But Bismarck's policy was reaction
ary from the beginning, and it con
tinued to give great offense to *Â»ie Lib
erals. He had tolerance neither for
individuals nor parliaments that op
posed his. views. * In October, 1862, he
dissolved the chamber (the majority of
which voted against his measures) and
declared that the Ministry would gov
ern on their own responsibility. In 1864
Prussia, with the aid of Austria, con
quered Sleswick and Holstein rom Den
mark, and In August, 1865, signed the
treaty of Gasteln In relation to those
duchies. Bismarck wanted to annex
Sleswick and Holstein to Prussia, but
could not obtain the consent of Aus
tria. The long rivalry between these
two powers was now brought to a
crisis. A majority of the German
Bund having voted for Austria, Prus
sia seceded from the Bund and formed
an alliance with the King of Italy. In
June, 1866, war was declared. The
Prussian armies immediately occupied
Hanover and Saxony, and advancing
Into Bohemia, they encountered the
Austrian army near Sadowa on the 3d
of July and gained a victory so de
cisive that the Emperor of Austria
forthwith made overtures of peace;
and a treaty of peace was signed In
August, 1866, by which Austria was ex-**
eluded from the German Bund. Han-"*
over, Electoral Hesse, Holstein and-*
other small . states were annexed t0.4
Prussia. Bismarck then negotiated se-^
cret treaties of offensive and defensive Â»
alliance with Bavaria, Baden and Wur
temberg, which were made public in
April, 1867, and by which the King of"*
Prussia was made the commander of"*
the armies of said states. This brief-*
and momentous war, which united^
nearly all of Germany, made Prussia^
one of the great powers of Europe, .
overshadowing a great state like
France and arousing the jealousy of
Napoleon 111. X
In 1867 Count Bismarck organized the^
North German Confederation, comprise
ing some twenty-two States with a-<
population of some 29,000,000, and in the.,
same year became the foreign minister.,
of this great alliance. In the Franco-
Prussian war of 1870-71 Bismarck ac
companied King William through the*
campaign, and dictated the terms of*
peace at Paris, which were ratified by-<
the assembly then sitting at Bordeaux..,
Thus he succeeded In organizing all the
German states into one compact fed
eration, and in January, 1871, he had-<
the supreme satisfaction of seeing his^
old King crowned Emperor of Germany
In the Palace of the French Kings at" 1
Versailles. The same month his mas-H
ter appointed him Chancellor of the^
German Empire, and in the following
March he was raised to the rank of"
Prince. . ; .- -:*:v, ; *
Bismarck presided over a congress of^
the great powers at Berlin, in 1878, at,
which a treaty of peace between Rus
sia and Turkey was signed. He heldH
the Chancellorship with undiminished^
grip, running roughshod over Parlia-,
ments, and generally doing as he will
ed till 1890. when the young EmperoH
with a jealous eye for his own new-made^
shadow began to curtail the iron
giant's official prerogatives, and Bis-"]
marck stepped outside before his offlciaH
house fell in. He was succeeded by Von^
Caprivi. Occasionally he has growled,
from his eminent retirement, and the]
world has always deferentially listened.^

stone with him. Gladstone created
nothing, destroyed much and would
have broken up the United Kingdom
if England had not shaken off his rule.
He was a man of words. Bismarck a
man of deeds. Yet neither had the lat
ter his equal in diplomacy.
"He was an expert in statecraft as
well as in statesmanship. He knew
how to make a king do his will. He
knew how to inspire in the souls of a
gTeat but divided people that sentiment
of unity without which no German em
pire was possible. He crushed Particu
larism. He taught Bavaria to look to
Prussia as her natural leader. He
made Catholic and Protestant lie down
together. Not merely the German em
pire, but Germany is the creation of
this single will. Before his time she
was, like Italy, only a geographical ex
pression. To-day she is a nation, and
as a nation she mourns for him who
out of some fifty-odd powers and prin
cipalities and contending peoples
brought the German nation and a Ger
man national life into being.
"No higher eulogy than that is pos
sible, but it ie the simple verdict of
history. Yet there is still something
to add. He has been a tremendous in
fluence not in Germany only, not in
Europe only, but throughout Christen
dom. He set himself like a rock against
the advancing flood of Socialism and
of all those lawless forces which all the
world over seek to disturb the existing
order of things. 'There has grown up of
late,' eaid Bismarck at Jena, 'a notion
that the world can be governed from
below. That can not be." He found
the kingly principle In Germany the
efficient principle of government and
he strengthened it and left it so. He
found the principle of authority, of
liberty regulated by law, the basis of
modern society. His example has made
it stronger. The world owes him much
as well as Germany."

STRANGE WAT IN WHICH THE NORTH POLE Keeps Moving Around
IT IS now a settled fact that the
north pole dances at a lively rate.
Of course the earth does not twist
so as to cause this phenomenon, nor
does the axis of the earth move.
But the center line of revolution
does, so that the effect is the same.
In reality what takes place Is similar
to what would happen if a needle were
pushed through an apple so that the
fruit could spin around. The needle
would be the axis and as long as it re
mained In the one place it would cor
respond to the earth if the north pole
were fixed. But if the needle were
moved ever so little to one side of its
â position there would be a change in
.the center of rotation. This is the
.oretlcally what has been happening at
the north pole ever since the world be
gan.
' The pole is dancing around and con
stantly causing a change in lines of
latitude.
In the year 1890 the change was so
great that if people had bought their
f^ont yards according to latitude and
longitude on January 1 by June 1 they
would have been living on their neigh
bor's property. In this year the pole
shifted around over a curve of nearly
ninety feet. This, of course, made a big
change in all reckoning of latitude and
longitude, but not enough to change
the position of a large island on a map.
This movement of the north pole hus
been known for some time, but Just
how it moved and how much has only
Just been ascertained.
To find out this one fact occupied
seven years and the work of hundreds
of men and millions of dollars' worth
of astronomical instruments. The re
sults of the work have been compiled by
Theodore Albrecht of Berlin and pub
lished under the title of "Investigations
Concerning Variations of Latitude."
The report Just issued is one of the
valuable publications of the Interna
tional Geodetic Society. Dr. Albrecht
gives the results of observations made
at twenty different observatories in dif
ferent parts of the world, determines
their relative position and combines
them so as to deduce a curve showing
the motion of the north pole of the
earth's axis from January 1, 1890, to
July 1, 1897. In the accompanying
figure this curve is shown, 90.0 being

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE POSITIONS OF THE NORTH POLE
FROM JANUARY, 1890, TO JULY, 1897.
Dr. Theodore Albrecht of Berlin has just completed observations , and
calculations which show that the poles of the earth continually shift
ing their positions. This report shows that since IS9O the north pole moves
in an erratic course in an eighty-foot circle. The center of the above fig
ure is thÂ« mean position of the north pole for the seven and a half years
under consideration. In 1890 the pole made about seven-eighchs of a cir
cuit around its mean position; in 1891 but little more than three-fourths
of a circuit, while in 1892 nearly the entire revolution was effected. The
two circles drawn at 0.3 and 0.4 seconds of latitude from the mean pole
give the scale of the figure, the radii of these circles being 30.5 and 40.7
feet respectively. â¢

retained in the class to which he be
longed the utmost possible supremacy.
The ideal of the one was such growth
throughout the empire of common
rights, interests, responsibilities as
should create national unity and not
only permit but stimulate general
progress, his conception of Providence
being that its beneficence would ad
vance with the advance of freedom.
The ideal of the other was the growth
of a mighty nation, guided unquestion
ably by Providence, but by Providence
acting through the agency of the
throne, surrounded by the class of
which he himself was the leader. The
one believed himself a representative,
the other believed himself a ruler. Thus
the one sought to disarm discontent by
reforms, the other to crush it with the
mailed hand. The one labored to ex
tend British prosperity and influence
throughout the world by opening all
markets to the trade in which he trust
ed his nation to get its share. The
other planned a policy of commercial
extension by colonization and exclusive
privileges.
"It must be said, however, in making
this comparison, that Gladstone de
veloped the application of a national
policy and principle though to a limited
degree recognized, while Bismarck was
compelled to deal with novel conditions
and few will question that the genius
of the latter surpassed that of the
former or that the impress of Bis
marck's Individuality on the history of
his time was more distinct and deeper.
We may hold that the tendencies of
the human race which Gladstone rep
resented are more potent and enduring
than the forces of which Bismarck so
superbly availed himself, but we must
see that the work of Bismarck, which
we can imagine no other man doing,
was essential and was tremendous. The
German nation he called into being, the
people to whom he gave ynlty, will In
due time take their rights and achieve
the destiny for which their great quali

distrust of Prince Bismarck. 'A very

'but very unscrupulous.' It was a
homely summing up. but It expressed
with unusual simplicity the popular es

âin every way one of the biggest men
of his time. Great, Mr. Gladstone did
not call him, because greatness in his
estimation implied a moral element
chiefly conspicuous for its absence in
the politics of Prince Bismarck. But
he was as big as he was unscrupulous.

Emilio Cnstelar, the supreme rhetori

of all the antitheses of the great Ger

'the species of men to which Bismarck
belongs is fading out and becoming ex

"He was great, he was unique, a
weariless worker, who never feared the

greatness was born with him. Born

â â . â L to be proud of
Bismarck. He was so typical a Ger
man and he avoided so many of the de
fects that commonly go with the Ger
man qualities. He was under no illu
sions, sentimental or otherwise, about
the world he lived in. He knew the
levers that move men, and he knew
how to operate them. His direct, prac
tical businesslike methods were rather
English than German. Not since Fred
erick the Great has there appeared a
German In high place who showed so
perfect an adaptation of means to ends.
Nobody has thought or will think of
praising Bismarck as a friend of hu
manity. He himself would have been
the first to reject such a pretension.
The epitaph he composed for his own
tombstone shows in what light his life
appeared to himself. He was a "faith
ful German." That he was a patriotic
German, according to his lights, can
not bo doubted. His life-long desire was
that his Prussia should be aggrandized,
and the great work of his life was the
bringing of all Protestant Germany, in
cluding even some Htutes which are not
nominally Protestant. Into one power
ful confederation under the primacy of
Prussia.
Even now, looking back over a gen
eration, it is hard to see how the union
could have been brought about if Bis
marck had not been. The dreams of

the "Ideologists" could not have been
realized without this "business man."
From his own point of view his success
was unmixed. He found his country
not higher than fifth in the list of
European powers. It would be hard to
find a "good German" who would ad
mit that he has left her even the sec
ond.
This was not a success that came of
any of the modern political forces that
have come into the world. It was not
the result of free discussion or of con
stitutional government. It was a suc
cess of "blood and Iron." It was a suc
cess of diplomacy, too, in the Bis
marckian sense. No statesman ever
knew better how and when to appeal
to the Interests or even the sentiments
of others, nor, when it suited him, to
manage their susceptibilities. But in
the last analysis German unity was
achieved under Bismarck by the same
means by which the Prussian mon
archy was built up tinder Frederick, by
having not only the best-disciplined
army, but the best-disciplined nation
in Europe. The scattered principalities
were welded into one powerful empire
by the same means by which the great
empires of history were established.
It was not to be supposed that a
statesman whose method had achieved
such a success would abandon it wtten
tho success had been achieved. And.
In fact, the German c nire under Bis
marck followed the traditions of the
Prussian monarchy. He could skill
fully cajole the leaders of parliamen
tary opposition. But in the last resort
he governed by force, which it never
became necessary for him actually to
use. The knowledge that he possessed
it was enough both for him and for
those who opposed him, and opposition
was not carried beyond the danger
point. "The consent of the governed"
was of no more necessity in Bismarck's
scheme of politics than in. Julius Cae
sar's. Accordingly, paternalism took
the pla.ce of individualism, and took the
form of "state socialism." What in
more modern communities are held to
be the rights of the people came to
them in Bismarck's Germany as
"graces" from the throne. He was
anxious to allay popular discontent in
every way except the one needful way
of admitting the right of the people to
govern themselves. When it came to
that, he always let it be understood
that the army was at the door of the
hstag. Accordingly individualism
was repressed; paternalism was sub
stituted: and in respect to political civ
ilization, the last state of the German
people ia worse than th- 1 first.
It was the irony of fate that Bis
marck himself should have perished at
the hands of the monster which he ha<Â»
built up. There is a human pathos ia
his appeal to the constitution and to
public opinion against the masterful
ness of his young "master," but there
is also a political retribution. The
Kaiser treated this appeal, when it was
made by Bismarck, as Bismarck had
taught him to treat itâ as Bismarck
himself hail been accustomed to treat
it when it was made by the representa
tivt s of the German people. The world
at large is under no debt to Bismarck.
It is not better or freer or happier be
cause he has lived in it. What even
Germany owes to him it must be left
for the future to determine, but it is
already plain that against this debt
there are heavy offsets and abate
ments.
In spite of the enormous space he
tilled In his own time, and of the enor
mous force he displayed, he can scarce
ly be ranked among the great men of
the world. The "measure of the great
ness of these men was the extent of
their "co-operation with the real ten
dency of the world." The measure of
Bismarck's strength wns the exte?it to
which he succeeded in obstructing this
tendency. The most powerful chain-
pion of reaction is not a great man. He
is only a "big fellow."

it will be possible to write it. Some of

F. ROBINSON FOR HEROIC CONDUCT IN SAVING
THE LIFE OF SECRETARY SEWARD. From a Photograph.
Special to The Sunday Call.
IK these days of military and naval heroism and a pa
triotic pridt; throughout the Union comparatively few
Californiana know that living in the little city of Po
mona in Los A.ngeles County there lives one of the fore
most heroes of the Civil Warâ a man to whom Congress
gave one of the very few gold medals ever struck for
j^orsonal bravery, besides voting him a gift of $5000 and its
thanks. He Is Major George Foster Robinson. He lives
with his family in a beautiful orangt grove along San An
tonio avenue in Pomona, and so modest Is he about the ex
traordinary honors that have come to him and his connec
tion with the most tragic chapter in American history that
some of hie near neighbors do not know the following tale.
Hut for the supreme heroism of Major Robinson the life
of Secretary i f State William (EL Seward would have been
sacrificed by an assassin at almost the moment that Presi
dent Lincoln was shot down by Wllkes Booth. Bravery on
the battle-field is very often incited by the mad enthusiasm
of the struggle, but the courage which leads an unarmed
man. In a darkened room, to race aim. st certain deaih in an
endeavor to save the life of a man neces&ary to his country
5n a critical hour, is the highest pitch of heroism. Nearly
every phase of the dark conspiracy which resulted in the
death of President Lincoln has become a matter of familiar
history, but the way in which the life of Secretary Seward
â was saved on the same fatal night if r.ot generally known.
Several versions â¢ f it have been given .luring the last thirty
years, but the man whose bravery rescued the Secretary of
State from sharing the fate of his chief has the soldier's
taciturnity. This is the story of the midnight struggle from
his own lips:
The trial of the conspirators in the Lincoln assassina
tion showed that the plot was to effect on April 14. ISCS. the
simultaneous slaying of President Lincoln, Vice-President
Johnson. General Grant and Secretary Seward. It was
expected thax General Grant, the head of <ne army, would
be In the private box with President Lincoln, and his as-
Eassination might easily be accomplished with the Presi
dent's. On the- fatal night Major R- binson, then a young
private in the army, was In attendance as a nurse upon
iry Seward, who was in bed with a broken jaw.
"I have never known," said Major Robinson, "how I
cam*? to be detailed to act as guard and quasi-nurse at the
home of Secretary Seward in April, 1365. I had been con
fined to the Douglas Army Hospital in Washing-ton for sev
eral months by a gunshot wound in the leg â received in the
operatic a ab< at Petersburg in the August previous. I was
â  well and had asked t-j be detailed to some employ
ment. Thi- war was over and soldiers were a drug in the
market. April 11 I waa detailed as guard and helper in the
sickroom of Secretary Seward.
"In war times military guards were frequently stationed
about the White House and the homes of the forernoÃt men
in the Government. Fears were expressed by some of the
military authorities in Washington, early in April, IS')5,
that Mosby.'s guerrillas, who had not ceased their belliger
ency when Lee surrendered at Appoir.attox on April 9 and
â were still raiding in Virginia, would make a last concerted
and desperate raid on Washington when least expected.
Therefore some care v.-as taken to have guards stationed at
certain pieces. The very day of Lee's surrender Secretary
Seward was hurt in a runaway accident. His arm v.-as
bnftcen, his jaw fractured and his body bruised. Surgeon
General Barnes had charge of Secretary Seward's caee. He
sont to the army hospital for a guard who knew how to care
for people with broken bones, and I was sent to the Secre
tary's. â  I !-H;sil^l
"The evening: of April 14 was beautiful and clear, and
Secretary Reward was much better. Surgeon General
Barnes called and saw that the broken bones were mending.
Early on the evening of thâ¬ 14th an informal meeting of th* 1
Cabinet officers took place at the bedside of Secretary
S&wavd, Secretaries Stanton, McCulloch and "Welles were
there. The meeting lasted about half an hour.
"At a little before 10 o'clock, when the Secretary Â»waa

geward ha to her sleeping room. Frederick W.
Seward . of the Secretary, hart retired to his
room. Miss Fannie Seward, a daughter, and I sat in the
sick-chamber on the second floor, where the slightest wish
of the Secretary might be anticipated. Miss Seward was
near the bed. Her father lay in a semi-recumbent posi
tion â that is, propped up in bed. At just about 10 o'clock
the sound of a man was heard down in th* hall. It was
afterward learred thnt a parley in undertones occurred on
the steps to the house with the colored porter in charge of
the doer, it seems That the porter paw a tall young man
or. horseback dash ud to the stone curbing on the street,
md then, throwing himself to the ground, hasten across
â¢.the sidewalk to the front door of the Seward residence.
" 'I am an assistant of Dr. Verdi. said he, rapidly, 'and
T have been â  -nt by him with medicine for Mr. Seward. I've
compounded it myself, and I've orders to see him myself
â¢.and tell him how and when to take it. I'm in haste and
must see him at once.'
"The pdrter answered that he had strict orders to admit
â no one to the house that nitrht. The stranger on repeating
his demand more urgently was admitted to the vestibule.
" 'You stay here while I go and see Mr. Frederick
Seward about this business,' said the colored man. He went
inside the door and started up the dimly lighted flight of
stairs to Mr. Seward's room. The stranger followed im
petuously at his heels. The heavy door closed behind him,
.and the assassin appointed to his share in the tragedy dur
ing weeks of conspiracy was on the scene of his crime.
More boldness, a summoning of all his grim resolution to
â¢ seek his victim and strike a mortal blow, now only remained
for him to do his part in the frightful scheme to slay Presi
dent Lincoln, General Grant, Vice-President Johnson and
Secretary â¢ward in different parts of the city at the same
moment.
"The first I knew of the assassin in the Seward house
was when the front door closed. Miss Seward heard the
sound of some one coming heavily up the front stairs, and
"remarked upon the carelessness of any one who would so
noisily approach a sick-chamber. The hall was partially
lighted, as I have said, and the stairs were built in two
short flights, with landings between, so that one could not
â¢look from the head of the stairs to the bottom. At the top
.of the stairway Frederick W. Seward, who had been called
by the colored porter, met the supposed messenger from the
doctor. The door of the sickroom was a yard away.
"I did not hear the conversation, but learned later that
it was somewhat as follows:
"â¢What la it?' asked young Mr. Seward in a whisper
of the tall young stranger.
" 'Dr. Verdi has Bent me with this medicine for Secre
tary Seward. It must be taken immediately. I am the
' doctor's student, and as I compounded the prescription- 1
.must tell Mr. Seward himself how and when to take the
medicine. 1
"Frederick Reward whispered something to the effect
that he would see if his father was awake. Then he silently
opened the door of the Secretary's room, and in the dim
light from the gas flame tiptoed over to the bed where his
' father lay. He turned and went back as silent .-is a cat to
â¢tho landing at the head of the stairs, where he said in a
whisper that he would not disturb the patient at that hour.
" As he spoke he closed the door.
liA& "In a trice there came the sound of blows as if some one
had been felled by a rattan. Not a word was spoken. I
sprang from my chair and threw open the hall door in tlfne
to see a very tall, powerful, beardless young man strike
â¢ young Mr. Seward two powerful blows on the head with a
navy pistol. Mr. Seward reeled and staggered.
"Then the stranger jumped through the door at me. I
saw his knife flash in the feeble gaslight. He dealt me an
awful blow on the scalp and forehead with his knife. I
. staggered forward while blood started down my face and
beard.
: "In a fraction of a second the stranger, wearing a long,
â¢ light overcoat, a black slouch hat and wearing cavalry
boots, gave Miss Seward a punch that threw her aside. ' â 
."When I glanced at him next he had pounced upon the
bedside nearer us, but further from the recumbent patient.
The assassin had his now broken navy pistol in his left
hand and a long heavy knife in his right. He knelt on the
bedside, leaned over and across the bed. and placing his
pistol on the Secretary's chest, he struck madly and fran
tically at the head and neck. It was all done so quickly
that the telling it makes it seem slow. I remember that the
thought of felling the stranger with a chair or of bsating
â¢ him on the head with a heavy silver water pitcher near at
hand flitted through my mind, but the chairs were too
heavy and there was a big chunk of ice in the pitcher.
"I saw (a thousand times quicker than it takes to tell
it) the assassin strike at the Secretary's head and lay open a
" gash in his cheek. But for the surgeon's bandages about
the fractured lower jaw, a mortal wound In the neck would
have been made.
"I leaped upon the stranger from the rear, snatched his
â  elbow as his right hand gripped the knife for a surer and
mo-e powerful stroke, and thus diverted the blade In the
nick of time. The knife went into the; Secretary's shoulder

â¢Then began a terrific hand-to-hand grapple. The as

second later he gave me another cut there. In a twinkling

me a slash across the left shoulder. I clenched my arms
about him with my utmost strength, while he was trying
to force me away so that he could use his arms either to
thrust his bloody knife into me or beat me into Insensibility
with the blows from his pistol.
"Meanwhile Miss Seward had pushed up the window In
the sickroom and had screamed Murder! murder!' and then
had' shrinked in the hall for help for her father. Although

On the night planned for the att-m-pt Major Robinson, then lately recovered from a wound received in the war, was detailed for duty in Secretary Seward'a

at his victim several times when Major Robinson sprang upon him and. notwithstanding he was badly wounded, he forced the assassin back. A fierce

intensity. No man who has never experienced a hand-to

All I saw was my desperate big antagonist and that knife

a second his stabbing tactics and tried to throw me. Then,
summoning all my strength. I tried to throw him by using
my shoulder under his arm as a fulcrum. My wounded leg
gave way and I partially staggered. The assassin made a

off his feet. While I had him in that position I urged him

DOES THE GERMAN EMPEROR KNOW CAUSE
of the Mysterious Death of Vor Hahnke?
THE mystery surrounding the
death of Lieutenant yon Hahnke,
about which so much was heard
nearly a year back, has been re
called to mind by the recent per-
formances of the German Em
peror at Odde, where his Majesty has
been inaugurating, with a vast amount
of ceremony, a monument erected by
himself to the deceased officer. If any
thing, the proceeding at Odde serve
only to deepen the mystery- It will be
remembered that the official version of
the accident attributed Yon Hahnke's
death to his losing control of his bi
cycle at a dangerous spot on a narrow
down-hill road, and falling in conse
quence into a raging torrent beneath.
Certain persons, including one or
more brother officers of the deceased,
were Baid to have witnessed the acci
dent, but the names of these witnesses
have never been disclosed, nor, so far
as can be ascertained, was any In
quiry into the affair held by the local
authorities.
Ugly rumors have been current con
necting the disappearance of Yon
Hahnke with the subsequent appear
ance of the Emperor with a black eye â
In explanation of which another strange
and unauthenticated story was official
ly put forward. Then, nearly two
months after the erent, it was an
nounced that the lieutenant's body had
been recovered, although It had pre
viously be^n demonstrated by practical
experiments that no human body could

while we were In fierce grapple, 1 j rill the time trying to
cut or stab me, I felt some one taking hold of me at my
rear. It Hashed into my mind tiiut here was an accomplice
of the murderer. Another swerve of our bodies, and I saw
in the dim lig^t that it was Major Augustus Henry Seward.
He had heard his sister's shriek, had sprung out of bed and
had come into his father's rour.i to find, as he at first
thought, two drunken soldiers soufTling in the darkness. So
he was trying to push us out of the room.
"As soon as I saw Major Seward I called to him, 'Hold
that man's hand; get that knife!' But the major reached
around me from behind and got his hands on the assassin's
shoulders, so as to push him along through the hall door.
The assassin came against the woodwork of the door and
thereby regained a firm footing.
"As quick as lightning he freed himself from my' grasp,
and raising his right arm gave Major Seward several stabs
hold together at this spot for more than
a few hours.
The body thus discovered, after hav
ing been in the water nearly eight
weeks, was brought back to Germany
with much ceremony and received a
quasi-public funeral in which the Em
peror figured conspicuously. Inquiries
made in Germany at the time showed
that German editors had received other
versions of the story of Yon Hahnke's
death, but that they were afraid to
publish anything on the subject.
Now we have the further extraordin
ary fact that, in addition to the unpre
cedented honors paid to him last year,
the Emperor has himself erected ami
himself inaugurated a monument to
this young navil lieutenant â whose
name was hardiy known outside his
own ship and his own family at the
time of his death. We also see the Ger
man press supplied over and over again
with narratives strongly suggestive of
official inspiration, detailing all the cir
cumstances of the tragedy. All infor
mation, however, as to the evidence on
which the narratives are founded 1 is
conspicuously wanting.
In one account it is stated that a
brother officer of the Hohenzollern was
with Yon Hahnke at the time of the
accident, but, strange to say, his name
is not given. An old man, and two
children are also stated to hnve wit
nessed the accident. The question nat
urally arises, when and by whom was
their evidence taken? Was there any
official identification of the body when
It was recovered? Did the Norwegian

Mr. Hansell, a messenger in the State Department, was
fleeing down the stairs to get help, he having been roused
by Miss Seward's screams and our struggles. Ine reliow
overtook Mr. Hansell half way down and gave him a slash
across the back. Then the assassin went out or the front
door like a rocket, leaped into his saddle, and, striking his
spurs into his horse'n Hanks, was off down the avenue^
'â¢How long was the assassin Payne in the house.
"Not more than three minutes. It all came upon us so
suddenly and was over so quickly that we had confusm
idoas of it for a time. The excitement was awIUl. when
the assassin was gone I turned to find Secretary Seward on
the carpet at the further side of the bed. His daughter was
bending over him. weeping hysterically. Mrs. Seward ran
into the room from hers, naturally wild with alarm.
"We turned up the gas and gave attention first to tne
Secretary. He was bleeding profusely. The pool of blood
in which he lay, the gvping gash <n the cheek, the wound in
his shoulder and his ghastly pale face all made a mgmrui
sight I lifted the patient to his bed and found that nis
heart still beat, although he seemed pulseless. I assured
the agonized mother and daughter that the Secretary was
still alive. Frederick Seward was walking aimlessly about
the room in a dazed condition. His skull was po severely
fractured that he was ill for months, and he never fully recovered until a surgical .operation took P
ing it off to Germany? Were the old
man, the two children and the brother
officer interrogated by any official or
tribunal? If so, why had the result
not been made public?
The function at Odde and the news
paper accounts of it all have the air
of being inspired by some more Im
portant motive than that of. commem
orating the accidental death of an un
known individual of humble rank. If
that motive be to dispose of the sinis
ter stories that have been in circula
tion, it is strange that such cumbrous
means are adoi-ted, while the much
simpler one of publishing the evidence
on which the official story rests is
avoided.
"Are you invited to Washington's
Fourth-of-July dinner, George?" asked
Samson of George the Third.
"Certainly," replied the King.
"And are you going?" queried Sam
son.
"Of course. Why not?" said the
King. "George and I buried the hatchet
years ago, and now we're having a
brand new ax made that we're going
to bury."
""Where are you going to bury it?"
asked Samson.
"In the head of any jay who tries to
make further trouble between us," re
plied the King, suavely.
Samson immediately took his jaw
bone out of his locker as a measure of
self-protection in case any of his re
marks should be misunderstood.

Major Robinson was an important witness in the famous
trial of the conspirators in Washington Congress quickly
recognized his heroism. He was given a vote of thanks and
awarded a girt of $oO<Â» and to him was presented a golden
medal struck for the occasion. The medal is, of course, very
highly valued at the major's house. There never was but
one larger, and it is similar in size and somewhat similar in
execution to the ones given General Grant and Admiral
Ferragut. It is heavy, three inches in diameter and a
quarter of an inch thick. On one side is a profile of Major
Robinson in bas-relief, around which are artistically ar
ranged the following words:
Awarded by Congress of the United States to
George F. Robinson for His Heroic Conduct in
Saving the of the Hon. William H. Seward,
Secretary of Suate of the United States, April i 4,
1865.
On the reverse side is the picture in bas-relief of the
struggle of Major Robinson with the assassin Pa>ne at the
bedside of Secretary Seward. The assassin is pictured with
his knife raised on high, tht Secretary is lying semi-pros
trate and Major Robinson is stayin~ the murderous hand
in a downward stroke. The meda! contains some $225 worth
of gold. The steel die for it took weeks of artistic labor
and cost upward of $2000.
For a few years Major Robinson was a clerk in the
War Department at Washington. He was one of the or
ganizers of the Grand Army of the Republic and he has
always been devoted and enthusiastic in that order. When
the Hayes administration came in Major Robinson's friends
insisted that he have a substantial and permanent reward.
The Legislature of Maine (his native State) passed a reso
lution asking that the risk of his life and his saving of the
life of Secretary Peward on such a supreme occasion as
the 14th of April, 1865, be remembered by the President of
the United States. James A. Garfield, Senator John A.
Logan and others took the Major's case to President Hayes
and he appointed him paymaster in the United States army
with the rank of major.
In August, 1S1Â»S, Major Robinson was retired from the
army, having reached the prescribed age limit. The only
relic he has of the night when assassination and conspiracy
stalked abroad in Washington is the knife with which
Payne almost killed Secretary Seward and the major him-
Felf. The weapon waa dropped at the curbing in front of
the Seward home when Payne excitedly leaped on his horse
after committing his crime and rode away. After the trial
and conviction of the conspirators Joseph Holt, Judge Ad
vocate General of the United States, gave the knife to
Major Rob'nson. It is as formidable a weapon for cutting
and slashing the human anatomy as was ever seen. Its
blnde is thirteen inches long and one and one-half inches
wide. It is as sharp, even now, as a. razor, and in the hands
of a strong man could easily be sent through a pine board
an inch thick. If Assassin Payne had ever had a good blow
with the knife at the chest or stomach of Secretary Seward
n? he lay In bed the blade would undoubtedly have gone
through him.

"It was indeed as gory a sight as many a war veteran

"When did I hear of President Lincoln's assassination.'
When Surgeon General Barnes came (in response to a mes
sage that Miss Seward dispatched at once) he was followed
by many men high In Government authority. The surgeon
showed deep anxiety and th>ughtfulness when he came into
the sickroom. I was engaged in washing the knife wounds,
and he looked at me abstractedly.
" 'How badly is the Secretary hurt? 1 aeked he.
"'I can't tell. You had best see that for yourself,' was
my reply.
"The surgeon general came to take my place at the bed

" "Where's Stanton and Johnson?' whispered I in alarm.
"'What do you mean?' he said.
" 'Why I nwra that this looks like a scheme to kill off
the whole Government,' said I, thinking of the threatened
raid of Mosby's guerrillas.
"Surgeon General Barnes did not answer. He left the
bed -nd went into the hall, which had filled people in
a few minutes. He spoke to some one there. he came

GREATEST DISTINCTION
EVER WON ABROAD
BY AN AMERICAN WOMAN.
A Chicago Girl Wh>o Is Going to India
as Vicereine; She Will Ta^e F^anK
Next to Queer) Victoria.
AN American girl, Mrs. George N. Curzon, will shortly occupy a rank
next to Queen Victoria in the British empire, as her husband, George
i 'urzon, has just been appointed Viceroy to all India. This is the first
time the exalted rank has been conferred on a commoner since the
great Warren Hastings held it.
Four years ago Mrs. Curzon was Miss Mary Leiter of Chicago and
Washington. Her brother, Joseph Leiter, is the young man who recently
lost $5,000,000 for the family In trying to corner wheat in Chicago.
Her husband will rule over 300.000,000 subjects of the British crown in
India and will receive a salary of $100,000 a year and $200,000 at the same
time for expenses. The cost of maintaining the viceroyaJ establishment
is something enormous, and former Viceroys have sometimes found that
they had to dip into their own private purses to help pay for maintaining
the official splendor of their position. The salary and expense money re
ceived by Mr. Curzon is six times more than the President of the United
States receives.
Mr. Curzon will undoubtedly be raised to the peerage, possibly to an
earldom, before he takes office, and his wife will join in his honors. This is
the first time in history that an American woman has risen to such a high
station in the British empire. Many believe the appointment is furnished
as an augury of the much-talked-of Anglo-American alliance.
THE Right Honorable George Na
thaniel Curzon, Under Secretary
of Foreign Affairs, has been ap
pointed Viceroy and Governor
General of India and in conse
quence his wife shares in his semi
royal honors. Four years ago she was
plain Mary Letter of Chicago. Now she
holds official rank in the British empire
second only to Queen Victoria,
Mrs. Curzon is 31. She has great
beauty. $5,000,000 as dowry and a
young husband who is already one of
the great men of his nation. She is
tall, dark and majestic. Her hair and
complexion are entrancingly beautiful.
She is brilliantly accomplished and has
been gifted by nature with a ready wit.
This is reputed to take a severe turn at
times. t
Mrs. Curzon will appear as a great
sovereign before the millions of In
dia. A beautiful, brilliant and talented
American girl, she is peculiarly fitted
to teach the benighted Hindus how
great a power a woman may wield. The
Viceroy of India has splendid palaces
at Calcutta and %imla. The Calcutta
palace is known as Government House,
and is the largest official residence in
the British Empire, exceeding in size
any of Queen Victoria's palaces. The
Simla palace is a large and beautiful
place in the mountains, intended for
use in the summer months when life
in Calcutta becomes unbearable.
The court of India over which Mrs. .
Curzon will rule is far more splendid j
md ceremonious than that of England.
This is absolutely necessary in order to j
impress the natives and the semi-in- j
dependent princes, who still form a
irery Important element in the Indian
empire. When the Viceroy receives at
jovernment House he wears a uniform
Heavy with gold lace and sits upon a
throne. His wife, beside him, on an
>ther throne, wears royal robes, cov
Â»red with diamonds and priceless jew
;ls, and a crown upon her head.
Many histories of the house of Leiter
have been published, but they do not
nil much space. There are brief biog- j
raphies of the father, longer accounts i
of the social triumphs of the mother â¢
md daughters, and a vast deal about
roung Joseph Leiter and his wheat
leal which ended bo disastrously.
So fur as the biographies go the
lead of the family was Joseph Letter,
who lived in a plain, old-fashioned
Wick house in the town of Leitersburg. j
Md., where he followed the business of
i carpenter. He had three sons, George,
ivho died years ago; Freehand, who j
ives in the old homestead, and Levi Z. |
Leiter, the father of the future vicerine
jf India.
Levi Lei tor took to trade with the cer
:ainty of a man confident of his future.
He was ilrst employed as a clerk in a
little country store. Then he went to I
Columbus, 0., where he Bold calico and
ribbons. He was little more than a
peddler. From there he traveled to
Chicago.
It was in 1856 that he entered the dry
poods house of Cooley. Wads worth &
Zo. Marshall Field was a clerk there
it the time. A very excellent salesman
*as Levi Leiter and he was advanced
rapidly. He was a saving man as well.
It was not long before he stepped
>ver the counter into the office and be
came a bookkeeper, at about $20 a week.
He married early. As bookkeeper his
:alents began to show themselves. He
became an expert judge of "credits."
A.fter a time the firm was reorganized
md Marshall Field became partner. In
Tanuary, 1565, the firm of Field. Palmer
& Loiter was organized. The Palmers,
Potter and Milton T retired two years
later, and Leiter became the credit
member of the firm of Field, Leiter &
Do.
No man in the West ever made a
greater reputation as a judge of cred
its than Levi Leiter. He has a genius
tor finance. The firm prospered to a
remarkable degree. Meanwhile Levi
Leiter saw the future of Chicago. He
!>e"-an investing in real estate. He i
sought unimproved lots and gobbled up
business property.
He devoted his life to the accumula
tion of money. In those days he was
i rough, somewhat uncouth man, mak
ng a god of his integrity, unforgiving, .
3evoid of all tact, without popularity
md singularly reticent. But he had the
Midas touch. â¢
When Mr. Leiter and Marshall Field
luarreled in 18S1 and Leiter withdrew
'rom the firm he received about $3,000.
Â»00 for his Interest. This he carefully
nvested.
It isn't on record that Levi Leiter was
?ocially ambitious, but his wife was.
The microbe of the pink tea and the
;otillon entered her brain when money
>egan flowing into her husband's
K>cket_
She made assault after assault upon
he exclusive garrisons of Chicago so
iiety, and was forced to withdraw with
jonor and slight loss. In fact, her vic
.ories were Spanish ones.
Now Mrs. Leiter probably didn't care
nuch anyway, because she realized that
.he entrance to Chicago society didn't
â¢any with it a sesame to the other
â¢ircles where she wished to rule.
Mrs. Leiter decided to >o to Wash
ngton, and it was a very wise move.
There are many ways of getting into
;ociety in Washington. A combination
if wealth and politics makes a very
â¢ffective lever. And when one can
jreak into ' the diplomatic set it in
sures a certain standing abroad.
The Letters first lived in the old
31aine mansion and afterward built a
1,/, â¢-â¢â ificent house fronting on Dupont
circle.' It is one of the show places of
he capital.
Meanwhile the children were being
â ducated Miss Mary Leiter and her
lister were not projected into a board
np school and 'then polished off In a
Inishing school, where young women
\re taught how to enter and leave a
â¢ Ira wing-room, and to make small con
'ersation in a perfectly polite way. The
â¢lder daughter studied seriously. She
vas sent abroad to complete her
schooling.
Then It was said long before her mar
riage that Miss Mary Leiter was de
termined to marry a foreigner and usu
ally it was added that he must have a
title. The result has shown that she
did not want a title so much as she
wanted power. And her training has
demonstrated that she appreciated the
advantage of a well-trained mind.
The Leiters have spent much time
abroad. Miss Mary Leiter took ad
vantage of her opportunities. She be
came proficient in the continental lan
guages.
The first warm friendship which Miss
Mary Leiter made in Washington was
with Mrs. W. C. Whitney, and through
her the young woman became an inti
mate friend of Mrs. Cleveland. She
was an everyday visitor at the White
House when she was in Washington.
There isn't any doubt that the eld
est daughter is the intellectual member
of the family. Young Joseph Leiter
went to Harvard and became immense
ly popular. He spent a deal of money
and did nothing in particular.
Miss Loiter met Mr. Curzon first
abroad. They saw much of each other
in England, and Mr. Curzon frequently
came to the United States.
There is no prouder family in Eng
land than the Curzons, and never was
there a harder-working or more ambi
tious young man. It isn't said any
where that It was a love match, which
is a, very excellent reason for believing
that it was. Undoubtedly Miss Leiter
could have married a title had she
chosen. Her father was worth 525,000,
000. She is very beautiful, a tall, dark
young woman, exquisitely graceful,
I>. ss'-ssing that indefinable thing called
"style," and with fine skill in gowning
herself. Many men fell in love with
her and many more with her prospect
ive millions.
Mr. Curzon fell in love with her.
No doubt both father and daugh
ter saw that the time was com
ing when George Curzon would be
a great man. To be sure he would
succeed to the title of Lord Scarsdale
some day if he lived, but he was not
content with that. The young man pre
ferred to carve his own name. His is
one of the great historical families -in
England. The original Curzon smote
the blonde-haired Britons with a dou
ble-edged battle ax at the side of "Will
iam the Conqueror, and he was made
Lord of the Manor of Lockinge, Berks,
and Flshead. Oxon. Giraline de Curzon
was a nobleman in Normandy.
To give an idea of the ramifications of
the Curzon family would be like read
ing pages out of Burkes Peerage. There
are so many lords and earls and honor
ables who have held high places, so
many intermarriages with illustrious
families, that one's eye wearies of the
long names.
The future Viceroy of India was born
in the family home of Eedleston. Over
the door is a motto, cut there years and
years ago: "Waste not, want not."
Possibly the able Mr. Leiter heard of
this motto and it impressed him.
George Curzon distinguished himself
in Eton, carrying off nearly every prize
and honor. He went to Oxford, where
he continued his prize-taking career.
He was a rather arrogant young man,
very haughty and very studious. There
is a couplet which ho has never been
able to live down which shows how
his fellow students regarded him. It
runs:
"There's George Nathaniel Curzon,
Who's a perfectly respectable perzon."
Entering politics he was returned
from Southport and he has been in the
House of Commons ever since.
At first he was unpopular in the

House for the same reason that he waa
unpopular in Oxford. He was too im
portant a "person." But he overcame
his defects. He trained himself until
he was recognized as being the most
effective debater next to Air. Chamber
lain.
While he was at Eton he began to
travel and he has been all over the
world. The East attracted him par
ticularly. He has written many re
views and three or four books which
have given him a permanent literary
position. His "'Problems in the East"
is accepted as a volume of great value.
Miss Mary Victoria Leiter and
GeÂ«>rge Curzon were married in Wash
ington on April 22, 1895. They went
to England shortly afterward. The life
oÂ£ the American girl there has been
a triumph. She entered into her hus
band's political life with enthusiasm.
She helped him make the canvass when
he stood for election. She entertained
in London. He found her an invalua
ble aid to his ambition.
As has been said George Curzon was
looking forward to the day when he
might become Premier of England. As
he is only 39, a mere infant in politics
according to the British idea, he
would have to wait a dozen years at
least.
Now Mrs. Curzon is an American,
and she doesn't believe in long delays.
She has the audacity which is the first
American characteristic. She quickly
learned that women play an important
part in English politics. She entered
into it and became one of those power
ful unseen, unrecognized forces that
surround Parliament.
When the greatest gift of the British
Government was offered Mr. Curzon it
was not believed that he would accept.
Many pe.-ple thought that the office
had not been placed at his disposal, for
It is the first instance in which a vlce
royalty has been offered to a com
moner. But the announcement made
in the Hous-- of commons last Thurs
day by Mr. Balfour has set ail discus
sion at rest, and the Manchester
Guardian, a high authority, 'adds that
it is an open secret that Mr. Curzon
accepted the place because his wife
wanted him to.
The position is more splendid, more
important and more powerful than the
wife of the President of the United
States. Mrs. Curzon preferred real
power over millions of subjects to the
quiet honors of a great Parliamentary
career for her husband, with a Prime i
Ministership in the distance. So Mr.
Curzon takes himself out of the line of
promotion to that great place.
Of course the Secretary of State for I
india is by law the ruler, but it is the '
\ivcroy really who controls things. It I
Is not a sinecure. The Indian Viceroy
is always referred to as the busiest
man iii Asia, and generally he is con
sidered the most important. He can
do pretty much as he pleases. He con
trols the enormous civil service ma
chine. He can make the army of 200,000
men move about as h*> pleases. When
ever he appears at a post parades are
held in his honor. He is wined and
dined and made much of by soldiers,
civilians nnd natives.

2 o'clock the cabin door was kicked
open and in rushed the freezing cold air
and a gruff voice yelled. 'Turn out and
come over to breakfast.' I slipped on
my heavy coat and moccasins, grabbed
a bundle of extra footwear and then
went over to a steaming breakfast of
beans, hot cakes and coffee. Then we
put the dogs in their collars and fas
tened the belly bands. With a chirp to
the leader Windy led off at a trot and
we got safely down the bank and en
tered the river trail. The dogs were
fresh, and now and then gave plaintive
little whines.
"About 4 o'clock we came to the
Twenty-five Mile cabin. Here we in
tended to stay for a couple of hours.
Windy ordered me to get out the grub
box and get a 'bang-up square.' We
let the dogs out of their harness and
Windy started a big camp fire. Three
hours after our stop we were on the
road again. The men and dogs were
all pretty tired, so we settled down to
that last stretch of twenty-five miles
of moonlight trail.
"About midnight we began to pass
dark, gloomy looking cabins, clearly
outlined against the white, gleaming
li^ht.
"Soon we came to. the squaw-man's
cabin, where we were to stay until we
got our return load. Windy kicked and
banged on the door, and at last they let
us in and Martha, Joe's squaw, lit the
fire and got us something to eat. I
slept until 10 o'clock, and when I tried
to get up I found every muscle about
me stiffened out as though it had an
iron rod run through it. But a warm
breakfast fixed me up so I could stag
ger along.
"It wasn't every one who could get
whisky at the North Alaska Trading
Co.'s store and Bill had to use all his
eloquence to get his load, but I knetv
it was all right when I hoard old Booge
saying, 'You see it's against the law for
us to break the seals. The stuff is bond
ed through to Dawson so I can't really
sell it to you. Bill.' Then he gave Bill
a very knowing look and continued.
'You know we are going to move the
whisky out of that old warehouse. And
may be the men might leave about
eight of those ten-gallon kegs outside
to-night. But I say. Bill, you'd better
leave that $1600 sack of dust with me if
you're afraid of carrying it back to Cir
cle City.'
"Bill passed over the saok, and then
turned and gave me a long serious
wink.
"That's all there was to the transac
tion. Both men were on their honor.
"Bill and I were up at two the next
morning, and by the time the squaw,
had breakfast ready we had driven the
dog team round to the store and had
tied on the eight kegs of whisky. A
little later we were on the trail again,
but now the dogs had a heavy load
to pull and we did not travel very fast.
"In the evening we reached the cabin,
where we were to spend the night. All
night long a wind-storm raged round
the house, and in the morning when we
were ready to start there was not a
sign of the old trail left. Bill sent me
on ahead of the dogs to find the trail
and then he came along shouting and
cursing. Every once in a while I could
hear his heavy whip snap on some
shirking dog, and then the whole five

yells. But the worst experience of all
was when we hit the rough ice where
the trail went over big chunks and sid
led round others, and here Windy could
not keep the sleds right side up, no
matter how hard he tugged and strained
at the gee-pole. It took all of our unit
ed strength to set a sled on its runners,
and this we had to do a dozen times be

about fifty below zero, and we nearly
froze before we got the tent up and
boughs laid on the snow. In about two
hours we had everything comfortable,
the dogs had been fed. Windy was
cocking supper and I had just finished
cutting enough wood to last all ni^rht.
After eating we lay back on our blank
ets and talked and smoked. Bill was
telling me stories of how they had run
whisky mills in Circle, and of smug
gling in the outside whisky. He got
out his pistol and began cleaning it.
The old six-shooter had seen service
with him as a cowboy and stage driver.
" 'Officer Holmes,' he said, "has de
clared that if he ever catches me with
a load of whisky he'll send me to Sitka
sure, and he swears he'll shoot Metley
too (this was Bill's favorite dog), but
I guess he won't be any too anxious to
meet us when we get in," and Bill
squinted along the barrel of his gun,
the candle light flickering on his harsh,
strong features.
"Bill gave a low chuckle and then
with a broad smile at me, he said, 'You
see. Brownie, we'll leave here at about
noon to-morrow, and get to Circle City
about one next morning. Everything
will be quiet then and we'll land the
stuff safe and sound.'
"Next morning we were awakened
by a long dog train passing by the tent
and headed for Fort Yukon. The' team
had broken the trail for us all the way
from Circle, so the rest of our trip was

I twelve that night the first lo^ cabins of
the western end of the town began to
appear. Here Bill stopped the team
and carefully tied up all the bells on
the dogs' collars, and then he strapped
the big six-shooter to his belt. Soon
we were pulling up the road cut in the
I steep bank of the river.
"Bill had quit swearing at the dogs
now. and I had hold of the leader's col

SHIPWRECKED SAILORS
SAVED FROM CANNIBALISM
Grewsome Experience of a San Francisco
.Merchant .among Whalers on
the Jllaskan Coast.
The following story of shipwrecked whalers, whom hunger and
privation drove to actual cannibalism, is taken from the diary of
'.' Julien Liebes, a prominent merchant of San Francisco, who made the
journey of which he relates in the United States revenue cutter Bear.
Mr Liebes is a member of the great mercantile house of the same
name, and is also interested in two of the most extensive commer
cial corporations doing business in Alaska and Siberia. He went on
a four months' journey of inspection, visiting during that period
every station and every point of interest along the coast of the
Bering and Arctic seas, on both the American as well as on the
Asiatic continents, and keeping a faithful record of all he observed.
The most thrilling incident is the rescue of a crew of famished
whalers who had become cannibals before the rescuers reached
them.
WHILE at anchor in the bay
of Unalaska, June 12, a
whale boat was seen enter
ing the harbor, and our
steam launch was sent off
to meet the new comer,
which proved to be the captain and
part of the wrecked crew of the whaler
James Allen. Captain Huntley of the
party told us a harrowing tale of suf
fering and implored us to go at once
to .the rescue of the remainder of his
..crew, whom he had left in the great
est, distress on a small island. With
Captain Huntley were six of his crew.
Our machinery was being repaired,
but Captain Huntley and his men
begged so earnestly not to delay that

obliged to give up. Some of the inhabi
tants have already moved out and their
houses are being demolished to make
room for the great arsenals, docks and
fortifications the Govern:" ent proposes
to erect in their stead.
For some time past in a quiet way
the Government has steadily been mak
ing improvements in Esquimalt, but
not one of the residents suspected that
the town was to be razed.
Two or three weeks ago a couple of
men of the engineers walked throuerh
the town, and wherever directed by an
officer accompanying them, drove deep
into the ground a little iron post. Their
stroll took the trio along the Victoria-
Esquimalt road from the Canteen field.
past th<> picturesque parish church of
St. Paul and down "the one street
of the little town" to its termination
at Esquimalt wharf.
The posts are still in position, with
the letters "W. D." (the sign of the
War Department), and the significant
t>road arrow beneath, to tell the resi
dents of the place that the time is ap
proaching when the town is to be of
ficially effaced, and Queen Victoria's
army and navy secure undisputed pos
session of the entire peninsula, of
which during the past half century the
naval hamlet has been the center.
we abandoned all repairs, put the ma
chinery together as fast as possible and
steamed out of the harbor within four
hours after we heard the news of the
wrecked crew. We encountered very
strong head winds, blowing almost a
gale, and we made very little progress.
Instead of reaching Unnak Island in
the morning, as we had expected, we
did not reach there until the follow
ing day. The United States steamer
Albatross started out with us, intend
ing to help in the search and rescue,
but she was compelled to put back into
the harbor on account of the severe
storm.
On June 14, toward noon, we reached
the place and made a landing to rescue
at the time, but we landed and on get
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 21, 1898.
In a word, the War Department is
preparing to take possession of all
private property contained within the
town of Esquimalt, in order to com
plete the equipment of the naval sta
tion, and make here at the southern
corner of Vancouver Island a sup
ply depot of the British Empire as im
pregnable as was Gibraltar fifty years
ago.
History has recorded many cases of
possession-taking by the forces of
Great Britain â and razing a town is not
altogether a new thing with her Ma
jesty's soldiery. The present experi
ence is unique, however, in that the oc
cupation of Esquimalt comes in pro
foundest peace, and the only ambition
of the citizens who must pack their be
longings and depart is to make the best
possible bargain with the invading
Government.
The people are taken by surprise.
They cannot but admit the wisdom and
necessity of Esquimalt town being
passed out of existence. Their present
business is simply to press upon the
representatives of the imperial Govern
ment the full extent of the actual sen
timental and prospective value of the
several holdings. In the meantime the
relentless War Department is showing
no un-British haste, but piece by piece
the private property upon which the
Government has set its eye is being
ting to the place of the famished whal
the crew. A heavy sea was running
ers the most appalling sight met us
human eyes ever beheld. There were
the survivors of that ill-fated whaler,
huddled together in an abandoned hut,
wan, hollow-cheeked. with sunken
eyes, emaciated and reduced to mere
shadows, and too feeble to stand erect.
They attempted to utter a cheer on
perceiving the rescuers, but the cheer
was so feeble that it almost died
within their throats. When they real
ized that they had reached the end of
their almost superhuman suffering they
smiled between tears.
But an ominous silence pervaded the
entire party, casting a deeper gloom
over the surroundings than *he cer
tainty of immediate rescue warranted.
At last they could conceal "he cause
of their embarrassment no loncrer and
made a clear, breast of what some of
Oiir party had dreaded on entering the
hut and finding the crew engaged in
cooking some substance, which ap
peared to be meat. They admitted
tnat they had become cannibals anJ
were cooking part of the remains of one
of their deceased comrades.
They told us that they had been on
the point of starvation, and so feeble
tha% they could neither move nor
speak above a whisper. They had
eaten Gideon after his death. WhÂ»n
his remains had been disposed of they
dug up Pena, who had been buried two
weeks.
They made the excuse that unless
they had done that our party would
have found them all dead.
The survivors we took on board were
Daniel Logan, Frank King, John Diet
rich, William Andrews, Joseph Allr?n,
John Ricker, D. Peterson, Joseph ill
lain and Frank Burton. They were so
enfeebled that they had to be carried
on board the ship and assisted to reach
; the forecastle. They were stripped of
! their filthy, tattered garments, swarm
ing with vermin, and given clean
clothes after their bodies were thor
oughly cleaned. They were a pitiable
sight when stripped.
On the following day we sent a party
out to explore the little island, and
found an Aleutian village within six
miles of the hut where we had found
the wrecked crew. They had no idea
of the existence of any human beings
on the island, though they had gone
quietly acquired, so that even now the
purpose and result are apprehendable.
Great Britain makes no flourish of
trumpets in the perfection of her prep
arations for attack or defense. She is
a silently moving force, and while dur
ing many months past hundreds of
men have been busily employed in the
fortifications of Esquimalt, none save
the most trusted officers of army and
navy possess the details of what has
been accomplished â or ever will unless
the demands of actual war should pro
duce a demonstration.
The plan contemplates the equip
ment of a store, repair and supply sta
tion second to none in the empire; the
building and manning of forts capable
of defending this depot aerainst any
force that could be brought against
it by sea or land; the providing of
docks large enough to receive the best
and biggest examples of marine archi
tectural skill, and the establishment of
barracks, a service prison and other
necessary buildings for the use and
benefit of the numerous soldiers and
sailors who will be required to hold the
forts and man the ships of the sta
tion.
The naval history pf Esquimalt has
been from first to last one of steady
expansion and development. The sta
tion owes its existence to-day chiefly
to geographical conditions, making it
from their camp several miles in search
of some habitation, hut or trace of life.
The following day we started back
for Unalaska and made Dutch Harb.<r
early Friday, June 15. When the res
cued crew had sufficiently recovered
from the terrible experience it had un
dergone the captain wrote the follow
ing report of the wreck and the sub
sequent events on the little island, his
report being supplemented by the nar
ratives of the sailors.
The whaling bark James Allen was
wrecked off the coast of Amlia Island at
1:38 a. m.. May 11. having struck a sunken
rock, causing her to fill rapidly. A fresh
breeze was blowing at the time from the
southeast, and the weather was hazy. At
9:30 p. m. the previous night the vessel
was judged to be fifteen miles west of
Amlia Island. At 11:40 p. m. land was re
ported three points off port bow. which
the captain supposed to be Seguam Isl
and. One hour later a reef was seen right
ahead. The vessel's course was immedi
ately changed to avoid the reef, when she
struck three times in rapid succession
upon a sunken rock, and then passed over
it into deep water. The pump was
manned at once, but it soon became ap
parent that the vessel was filling very
fast, and orders were given to clear the
boats. While the boats were lowered the
captain secured a chart and chronometer,
from the cabin anu passed them into the
starboard boat, the captain following.
The boat had been badly stove in the
haste of lowering it. The first mate und
several of the crew jumped into the boat
of the second 'mate, passing the dam
aged boat, containing the captain and
three of the crew. Just as the boats
pulled away from the ship her fore and
main masts fell, and raising her head
high out of the water she was seen to go
down stern first.
The captain and his men kept bailing
their damaged boat with the one bucket
they had and tneir hat= all night, and so
managed to keep her from sinking, bail
ing and drifting until daylight, when
they drifted near the east end of Amlia
Island and made a landing in the lea of
the island. Two other boats came along
some hours later and also landed, thus
making 22 men and the captain saved
from the wreck. The other boats they did
not see, though it was learned later" that
one was sighted by natives and rescued
by the steamer Dora and taken to Una
laska by the United States steamer Pe
trie.
Hauling the boats up against a fissure
in the rocks, .nd with the remnants of
what had once been a sail, they man
aped to make some sort of shelter. The
gale continued for two days, and they
were unable to get a boat off the beach
so they were obuged to subsist on mus
sels and seaweeds. On the third day the
storm somewhat abated and a boat was
naturally a place of strategic value, yet,
surprising as it may be to many, it was
not a naval or a military officer who
mounted the first gun in Victoria's ser
vice suburb. Here, as in not a few
other places, the colors of the nation
followed the house flag of the Hud
son Bay Company, and it was one
of the outposts of this semi-national
colonization corporation who first re
cognized the advantages of the mag
nificent harbor and commanding emi
nences overlooking, that are nature's
contribution to the value of the new
stronghold.
This was in 1837. when Dr. Tolmie
made his way north from Fort Van
couver, on the Columbia River, for the
purpose of developing trade with the
natives of the then utterly unknown
wilderness of Vancouver Island. His
landing place was on the north side of
the harbor, not far from the present
station of the Island Railway, and, as
many Indians had their homes in the
vicinity, he concluded it would be an
excellent plan to remain and initiate
them in the mysteries of the white
man's commerce. At the point of his
debarkation he built his fort, calling it
Camisen, and within the rude stockade
did the first business of the new coun
try.
As the weeks rolled by and he solved
got off, and with hooks made of the han
dle of an old tin pail they caught some
codfish.
On the morning 1 of the following day
the wind came from the southeast, and
all three boats started for Unalaska, 240
miles distant. They had but one sail be
tween them, which was made out of two
sheets. The boat carrying the sail took
the other two in tow. passing Amukta
Island at about midnight. The wind be
gan to increase in fury, until it had
grown to a furious gale on the morning
of the following day. June 17. The for
ward boat began to leak badly and was
compelled to cast the others off, though
they kept together as much as possible
driving before the gale. On tne ISth they
ran toward the Four Mountain* Island
and tried to make a landing, but were
prevented by the heavy surf. They tied
their boats to some rocky shelf off shore,
and numb and stiff from the cold spent
the night without food or water. The
wind veering around again in the morn
ing from the southwest, they concluded
to abandon one boat, stow the 26 men In
the remaining two. and make one more
effort to reach port. On that day Patrick
Conbolly, one of the crew. died, having
succumbed to hunger, privation anu ex
posure.
Leaving the Four Mountains group they
went northeast toward Unnak Island.
About 3 p. m.. In jibing a sail, the cap
tain's boat capsized and before aid
could be rendered. William Fitzgerald
John White. E. Elvey and Frank Mur
phy were swept away by the sea and
drowned. To attempt righting the cap
sized boat appeared to be too hazardous
an undertaking, so she had to be aban
doned, and the nine remaining men were
taken Into the last boat, which became
dangerously overcrowded with twenty
two men.
That night a landing was effected on
Unnak Island and a frugal meal made
of mussels and seaweed. During the
night Samuel Masterson died, having
succumbed to the unnatural strain and
over exertion.
The captain realized that the crew
could be saved only by reaching Una
laska within the shortest possible time,
and he picked six of the strongest men
of the party, leaving the rest behind, and
started for Unalaska. They had been
out but a short distance, when a strong
gale sprang up, driving them back Into
camp before night. During that day
Harry Taylor and William Day had died.
Some of the men hunting around for
food found an abandoned hut, which had
probably been used by sea-ottor hunters.
The party moved into the old hut that
same night for shelter. They found In
the hut two rusty tin pails, from the wire
bails of which they made fish hooks.
From May 23 until June 5 the captain
had made four unsuccessful attempts to
reach Unalaska, being driven back each
time by stormy weather.

the problem of intercourse with the
natives, Dr. Tolmie learned from them
that there was a large and more pros
perous village only a few miles away,
to which attention might be given with
promise of profit. He was guided
across the little neck of land to what is
now known as Deadman's River,
through the Gorge, and down the
Arm to where five thousand or more
Si washes were camped on the site of
the present city of Victoria. That set
tled it with Dr. Tolmie. His mission
was with population and so he
promptly pulled stakes, literally as
well as metaphorically, and trans
ferred his headquarters to the smaller
harbor, leaving Esquimalt once again
deserted by the whites.
The present drydock at Esquimau
was commenced in 1880, and completed
some few years later, under the joint
control of the Imperial and Dominion
Governments, both of which contrib

WHY NOT USE PH ONOGRAPHS
TO TAKE COURT TESTIMONY ?
Jlttorney General Fitzgerald Thinks T^at
a Few Years .May Bee Tl^em Put
to Suel? Use,
WHY not use the phonograph
in our courts of law?
The idea is simply to use
the phonograph for taking
down evidence instead of a
stenographer. The plan was
first suggested by Attorney General
Fitzgerald the other day, when he ex
pressed himself warmly in favor of the
Instrument. I called upon the Judge
to get further particulars.
"Yes," he said, "it is quite true. I
b^ieve that in the course of a few
years we .will have the phonograph
generally In the California courts."
"Are they used anywhere else for this
purpose?"
"I don't know, but I don't see why
we shouldn't have them here. But I
have not had time to work out the de
tails of the scheme."
"But how could you be sure of the j
phonograph's veracity? Would you
swear in the machine?"
"Well, I don't see how we could in- I
duce a machine to take an oath, but I
we could put the man who turned the j
crank under bonds."
That was all the Judge would say I
about the phonograph. But there can â¢
be no doubt that his idea is destined j
to bear fruit In the future, and that \
the reform will vastly facilitate the j
working of jiistice.
Not only will the courts be able to <
get through more work than under the j
present system, but absolute, unim
peachable, mechanical accuracy will be
secured. There can be no possible dis-
breadth, and forced upon the British
admiralty for consideration a fact that
has an important bearing upon the
present operations.
Up td the building of the existing?
dock and for some little time there
after it was not anticipated that any
larger craft than the then best of Eng
land's navy would ever require to be
cared for on the Esquimalt blocks.
Never yet has a ship been detailed for
service on the North Pacific that is too
lar^e for docking here. The day has
gone by, however, when such a restric
tion can be allowed to stand, and the
question now is whether the existing
dock shall be enlarged or a new and
much larger one be constructed wholly
for the accommodation of England's
giant dogs of war.
To enlarge would, according to the
superintendent of the dock. Captain.
Devereux, mean nothing less than the
construction primarily of a cofferdam
costing $45,000 or $50,000, and then the
tearing out of one entire side of the
dock. To do this wouid be practically
as expensive as to buiid a new dock,
and hence it is anticipated that the
latter course will be pursued, the site
chosen being the little cove on the
Victoria side of the village, at the
base of Signal Kill, and at present the
rendezvous of the torpedo-boats and
torpedo-boat chasers.
I pute as to the actual words used by
i a witness: the element of human error
; will be entirely eliminated. The method,
; in short, would be as far ahead of our
; present plan as we are ahead of the
: practice followed in most European
i courts.
In the English police courts, for mi
i stance, it is still the custom to take
down the testimony of each witness in
| longhand, a painfully slow method.
j Then, when the evidence is finished, the
| whole manuscript has to be read over
j and the witness is required to sign his
name. It takes a long time to get
through a case, and it is not uncom
| mon for the examinations in an im
j portant trial to last two or three days.
In the upper courts things move some
what more rapidly, for there, as a
rule, no official record is kept of the
evidence. This often leads to much
confusion, and disputes as to the exact
nature of the evidence given are fre
quent between the contending lawyers
on either side.
The employment of a stenographer is
certainly a great advance on this. But
the most skillful shorthand writer is,
after all, only a human being, and lia
ble to err. Besides, there must neces
sarily be some delay in transcribing
the evidence before it can be made
available for use. The phonograph
would present its record at once all
ready for reference. The machine, of
course in charge of an expert, wimld
be placed on a stand close to the wit
ness, who would be required to speak
clearly and distinctly, so as to produce
a good record. Instead of signing the
evidence, as at present, the witness
would make a verbal declaration as to
its accuracy.

Ships and Some Pertirjent
Deductions Regarding New
Naval Warfare.
BY A NAVAL EXPERT.
THE gun is still the supreme sea
weapon.
It is true that the greatest
havoc in the Spanish ships driven
ashore off Santiago was caused
by fire, but this conflagration was
a secondary and not a primary cause.
Of the four ships examined and re
ported upon by the naval board three
were wrecked by the explosion of their
magazlneÃ. This also was a secondary,
not a determining, cause. No, the main
weapon was not the ram nor the tor
pedo, but the gun.
It is impossible yet to state what ef
fect the American projectiles may have
had upon the submerged parts of the
hulls, but the above-water structure
yields convincing evidence >ot gun
power. The total number of Sfcpts fired
in the action has not been made pub
lic, but we have reports of two ships,
and if these be accepted as a ratio for
the others the ammunition rained upon
the Spaniards must have been enoT
mous.
Captain Evans of the lowa states
that the following is an approximation
of the projectiles fired from his ship:
Thirty-one 12-inch semi-armor piercing
shells, with full charges; 35 8-inch com
mon shells, with full charges; 251 4-inch

Cook of the Brooklyn reports that he
fired 100 rounds of 8-inch shells, 473 s
inoh, 1200 6-pounder and 200 1-pounder
ammunition. If the other battleships
maije the same average as the lowa we
will get, after allowing: for the respec
tive differences in caliber, a total of
about 190,000 pounds of metal, or ninety
tons, discharged against the enemy.
Assuming that about 6f>oo shots in all
were fired, and this approximation is
fairly close, we find, excluding the fires
from the 6 and 1 pounders, that 1500
projectiles of the larger calibers were
discharged by the Oregon. Brooklyn.

riddled by the rapid fire of the
one and six-pounders carried by
all the American ships."
The total of forty hits ap
plied to the projectiles fired
gives about 3 per cent of suc
ccsFful shots. To the layman
this may seem a small ratio, but
it is very good, indeed, when the
smoke, distance and the diffi
culties of a running fight are
considered. The engagement
started at a range of 6000 yards
âthat is, at a distance of about
three miles. Following out an
approved sea maxim and the es
pecial instructions formulated
by Rear Admiral Sampson the
ships closed gradually, so that
both torpedo-boats and two of
the armored cruisers were de-
Btroyed when within 2500 yards.
At one time the Vizcaya and
the Brooklyn were engaged in
close order for modern fighting,
the distance estimated being
Just over 1000 yards.
In the special report made by
the board it Is stated that the
Almirante Oquendo suffered
more than any other of the
s,hips, except the torpedo-boats.
Her upper works were masses of
distorted steel and her decks were lit
tered with killed and wounded. She was
hit on the port side four times by eight-
Inch shells, three times by four-inch
Bfcells, twice by six-inch guns and for
ty-two times by six-pounders. As will
be seen in one of the illustration^, an
eight-inch shell entered the forward
turret at the gun embrasure. This ex
ploded and killed every man in the
turret, most of them instantly, for the
officer standing in the firing hood and
one man at a lever were found in these
positions when the ship was examined
by rhe board.
The Vizcaya was swept by a storm of
projectile* from the rapid-fire guns.
She was hit by the larger projectiles
fourteen times and by the B-potmdera
eleven times. The S-inch guns of tho
Brooklyn and the Oregon and the fl
inch guns of the Brooklyn completely
wrecked her structure above the armor
belt. The 6-inch shells perforated hi-r,
ar : d supplementing all this was the de
structive work of the lowa's 4-inch. In
tho Infanta Maria Teresa, thp only ves

ably fired by the Texas and one from
some other, of the battle-ships. Each
claims the shot. An 8-inch shell, cred

SAVING THE
WRECKED WARSHIPS
Special to the Sunday Call.
TIIAT friendly hand of fate which
revealed to Richmond Pearson
Hobson, naval constructer U. S.
N-, the road to undying glory by
moans of the Merrimac, had still
another meed of fame in store for him.
This young man. the personification of
naval skill and intelligence, has pitted
himself against a board of older offi
cers who decided in their wisdom that
ihe Cristobal Colon, late of Admiral
Cervera's squadron, could not be raised
from its bed on the shoals of the
Southern Cuban coast.
When ih. liobson, after a personal
Inspection of the wrecked ships, told
Admiral Sampson that, in his opinion,
both the Colon and the Maria Teresa
could be saved, he was sent norih at
once to lay his views before the au
thorities at Washington. He talked so
convincingly that it was not many
hours before he was in consultatl m
with a certain wreokisg company,
whose offices, In one of the older build
ings on Wall street, are known to gov
ernments and magnates of steamship
lines and millionaires whose whim is to
the seas in Moating palaces.
In a coiner of one of these office
rooms sits a quiet American citizen.
From his desk go forth many invisible
lines leading to all parts of the coast
At the end of these lines are pe*
tugs and floats and giant cranes, and
a small army of men to work them.
One of these lines led to an unfortu
nate battle-ship whose bones still lie
in Havana harbor. And another line
is even now leading down to a stretch
of beach on the south coast of Cuba,
where six Spanish war vessels are
groveling ana grinding and beating as
if anxious to escape from the vengeance
of an outraged people. It is to save
two of these craft that the wrecker
has marshaled his forces at Construc
tor Hobson's invitation.
That the risk will be difficult is v well
a to those who understand the
waya of the weather during these hur
ricane months around Cuba, but Hob
son by his Intelligence and bravery has
earned the confidence of the Govern
ment and he is to be given a free hand
in the matter.
There is another reason why the Gov
wnment is anxious to float these ships
â ;one outlined in a remark made by a
high official in the Navy Department
during the discussion of the question.
"We must not fail to fly Old Glory over
at least one of the ships of Cerveras
former fleet, even if it means double
the cost of the vessel." he said. "The

A better understanding of the work
necessary in raising the Colon can be
obtained from a description of the
wrecking of the Wells City, an English
steamer, of 2000 tons, which was sent to
the bottom of the North River by a
collision with the American steamer
Guyandotte. The same company now
working on the Spanish warships
raised the "Wells. City, and the same

SHE KISSED THE COLD FOREHEAD WITHOUT A TRhMOR
Copyright, ISSS. by Bret Hart.
PAKT 11.
As she entered the iron gates at the lower end of the
park, and glanced at the interwoven cipher and crest of
the Amelyns still above, she was conscious that the wind
was blowing more chill, and that a few clouds had gath
ered. As she walked on down the long, winding avenue,
the sky became overcast â and in one of these strange con
trasts of the English climate, the glory of the whole day
â¢went out with the sunshine. The woods suddenly Became
wrinkled and gray, ihe distant hills somber, the very En
glish turf beneath her feet grew brown; a mile and a half
away, through the opening of the trees, the west part of
the Priory looked k crumbling, ivy-eaten ruin. A few
drops of rain fell. She hurried on. Suddenly she remem
bered that the avenue made a. long circuit before approach
ing the house, and that its lower end, where she was
â¢walking, was but a fringe of the park. Consequently there
must be a short cut across some fields and farm buildings
to the back of the park and the Priory. She at once di
verged to the right, presently found a low fence, which
she clambered over and again found a footpath which lea
to a Stile. Crossing that, she could .see the footpath now
led directly to the Prioryâ now a grim and austere looking
pile In the suddenly dejected landscapeâ and that it was
probably only used by the servants and farmers. A gust
of wind brought some swift needles of rain to her cheek;
â he could see the -sad hills bevnnd the Priory already veil-
Ing their faces; she gathered her skirts and ran. The next
field was a long one, but beside the further stile was a
small clump of trees, the only ones between her and the
park. Hurrying on to the shelter, she saw that the stile
was already occupied by a tall but bent figure, holding a
long stick in his hand, which gave him the appearance,
against the horizon, of the figure of Time leaning on hia
scythe. As she came nearer she saw it was, indeed, an
old man. half resting on his rake. He was very rugged
and weather beaten, and, although near the shelter of the
trees, aparently unmindful of the rain that was falling on
his bald head, and the limp cap he was holding useless
In one hand. He was staring at her, yet apparently un
conscious of her presence. A sudden instinct came upon
herâ it was "Debs!"
She went directly up to him, and with that frank com
mon sense which ordinarily distinguished her. took his cap
from his hund and put it on his head, grasped his arm
firmly, and led him to the shelter of the trees. Then she
wiped the raindrops from his face with her handkerchief,
ehook out her own dress and wet parasol, and, propping
her companion against a tree, said:
"There, Mr. Debs! I've heard of people who dldn t
know enough to come in when it rained, but I never met
one before. '
The old man started, lifted his hairy, sinewy arm. bared
to the elbow, and wiped his bare throat with the dry side
of it. Then a look of Intelligenceâ albeit half aggressiveâ
came to his face. "Wheer beest tha going?" he said.
Something In his voice struck Sadie, like a vague echo.
Perhaps it was only the queer dialect â or some resem
blance to his granddaughter's voice. She looked at him a
little more closely, as sne said:
"To the Priori."
"Whaatr*
She pointed with her parasol to the gray pile in the
distance. It was possible that this demented peasant didn't
even understand English.
"The hall? Oh. ay!" Suddenly his brows knit omin
ously as ho faced her. "An' wassist tha doln' dresst oop
In this folnery? Wheer gettest thee that goawn? Thiss^n,
or thy maester? Nowt even a n'apron, fit for thy wark
as maid at serviss; an' parson a gettin 'tha place at hall!
So thou'lt be high and moity will tha? Thou'lt not walk
wi' maids, but traipse by this sen like a slut in the toon â
dang tha!"
Although it wAs plain to Sadie that the old man. in his
wandering perception, had mistaken her for his grand
daughter in service at the Priory, there was still enough
rudeness in his speech for her to have resented It. But,
strange to say. there was a kind of authority in It that
touched her with an uneasiness and repulsion that was
stronger than any other feeling. "I think you have mis
taken me for some one else." she said, hurriedly, yet won
dering why she had admitted it, and even irritated at the
admission; "I am a stranger here, a visitor at the Priory.
I called with Miss Amelyn at your cottage, and saw your
other granddaughter; that's how I knew your name."
The old man's face changed. A sad. senile smile of
hopeless bewilderment crept into his hnxd mouth; he
plucked his limi> cap from his head and let it hang sub
missively In his fingers, as If it were his sole apology.
Then he traid to straighten himself and said: "Naw of
fins. miss, naw offins! If tha knaws mea tha'll knaw I'm
grandfeyther to two galls as moight be tha owern age;
tha'll tell cc that old Debbs at haaty years 'as warked

he doy. An' 'c's put by enow to loy wi' his own feythera
in Lanksheer, an not llggln aloane In Parson's choorch
jard."
It was part of her uneasiness that, scarcely under
standing, nor. indeed, feeling any interest in these maun
dering details, she still seemed to have an odd compre
hension of his character and some reminiscent knowledge
of him. as if she were going through the repetition of some
unpleasant dream. Even his wrinkled face was becoming
familiar to her. Some weird attraction was holding her;
she \j-anted to get away from it as much as she wanted to
analyze it. She glanced ostentatiously at the sky, pre
pared to open her parasol, and began to edge cautiously
away.
"Then tha' beant from these pearts?" he said, sud
denly.
"Xo. no!" she said, quickly and emphaticallyâ "no, I'm
an American."
The old man started and moved toward her, eagerly,
his kr-on eyes breaking through the film that at times ob
scured them. "Merrikan! tha baist Merrlkan? Then tha

en cheeks, and stared in her face. The quick transition of
fascination, repulsion, shock and indefinable apprehension
made her laugh hysterically. To her terror he Joined in It,

A wild terror and undefined consternation had com
pletely overpowered her! But she made a desperate effort
to free her wrists, and burst out madly:
"Let me go! How dare you! 1 don't know you or
yours! I'm nothing to you or your kin! My namo is Des
boroughâdo you understand â do you hear me, Mr. Debs?
â DesborouffH !"
"So thou'lt call thissen â Pes-borough!â wilt tha? Let

That's what tha beast!"
With flashing eyes and burning cheeks she made one
more supreme effort, lifting her arms, freeing her wrints,
and throwing the old man staggering from her. Then she
leaped the stile, turned and fled through me rain. PÂ»it
before she reached the end of the field she stopped! Sne
had freed hereelfâ she was stronger than heâ what had
she to fear? He was crazy! Yes, he must be crazy, and
he had insulted her, but he was an old man â and God
knows what! Her heart was beating rapidly â her breath
was hurried â but she ran back to the stile.
He was not there. The field sloped away on either sidÂ«
of it. But she could distinguish nothing in the pouring
rain above the windswept meadow. He must have gone
home. Relieved for a moment, she turned and hurried on
toward the Priory.
But at every step she was followed, not by the old
man's presence, but by what he had said to her. which she
could not shake oft as she had shaken ofT his detaining
fingers. Was it the ravings of insanity, or had she stum
bled unwittingly upon some awful secretâ was It after all
a secret? Perhaps it was something they all knew, or
would know later. And she hnd come down here for this.
For, back of her indignation, back, even, of her disbelief in
his insanity, there was an awful sense of truth. The
names he had flung out of "Debs," "Debbans" and "Deb
brook" now flashed upon her as something she had seen
before, but had not understood. Until she satisfied herself
of this she felt she could not live nor breathe: She loathed
the Priory, with its austere exclusiveness as It rose before
her; she wished she had never entered it, but It contained
that which Ehe must know, and know at onoe. She en
tered the nearest door, and ran up the grand staircase.

Her flushed face and disordered appearance were easily ac
counted for by her exposure to che sudden storm. She
went to her bedroom, sent her maid to another room to
prepare a change of dress, and sinking down before her

put it away.
Yet under this surface sparkle and nervous exaltation
Sadie never lost consciousness of the gravity of the situa
tion. If her sense of humor enabled her to see one side of
its grim ironyâ if she experienced a wicked satisfaction in
accepting the admiration and easy confidence or the high
born guests, knowing that her cousin had assisted in pre
paring the dinner they were eating, sTie had never lost
sight of the practical effect of tht- discovery she had mad.-.
And she had come to a linal resolution. She should leave
the Priory at once and abandon all idea of a matrimonial
alliance with Its heir! Inconsistent as this might seem to
her selfish, worldly nature, it was nevertheless in keeping
with a certain pride and independence that was in her
blood. She did not love Lord Algernon, neither did she love
her grandfather; she was equally willing to sacrifice either
or both; she knew that neither Lord Algernon nor his
father would make her connections an objection, however
they might wish to keep the fact a secretâ or otherwise
dispose of them by pensions or emigration, but she could
not b*ar to know it herself! She never could be happy as
the Mistress of Scrooby Priory with that knowledge; she
did not. idealize it as a principle! Carefully weighing it by
her own practical common st-nse, she said to herself that
"It wouldn't pay." The highest independence Is often
nkin to the lowest selfishness; she did not dream that the
same pride which kept her grandfather rrom the work
house and support by his daughters. hÂ«d kept him from
communicating with his own son, and now kept her from
acknowledging them even, for the gift of a title and do
main. There was only one question before her: Should
she stay long enough to receive the proposal of Lord Al
gernon and then decline it? Why should she not snatch
that single feminine joy out of the ashes of her burnt-up
illusion? She knew that an opportunity would be offered
that afternoon. The party were to take tea at Broxby
Hall, and Lord Algernon was to drive her there in his

"What are you talking about?" said Sadie, pausing In

line:

The Consul glanced around him; no one had apparently
noticed the Incident. He slipped back into the house and
made his way to the library. It was a long gallery; at the
further end Miss Desborough stood cloaked, veiled and co
quettishly hatted. She was looking very beautiful and
animated. "I want you to please do me a great favor,'
she said, with an adorable smile, "as your own country

"If you do not speak to them I will!" said Miss Des

the more plausibly from you. Come! My mind is made

step forward.

There could be no doubt of the girl's sincerity, nor was

he knew that she and Lord Algernon could have had no
private Interview that evening. He must, perforce, ac

"You seemed to like the place so much last night. I

'The Priory ghost," she said quickly: "what's that?"

She turned away and entered the cottage. The grand
daughter she had already seen and her sister, the servant
at the Priory, were both chatting comfortably, but ceased
as she entered, and both rose with awKward respect.
There was little to suggest that the body of their grand
father, already in a rough oak shell, was lying upon tres
tles beside them. '
"You have carried out my orders, I see, said Miss
Desborough. laying down her parasol. :
"Aye, miss, but It was main harrd gettin it dooan so

"Never mind the cost. I've given you money enough, I

"But I understood you to say, said Miss Desborough,
with an impatient flash of eye, "that your grandfather

"Aye, miss," said the girl, apologetically, "an' naw .

"For all that you needn't tell anybody It was given by
me," said Miss Desborough. , "And you'll be sure to bo
ready to take the train this afternoonâ without delay."
There was a certain peremptoriness in her voice very un
like Miss Amelyn's, yet apparently raucn more effective
with the granddaughter. -; r \
"Aye, miss. Then, if tha'll excoose mea, I'll go streight
to 'oory oop sexton."
She' bustled away. "Now," said Miss Desborough,
turning to the other girl, "I shall take the same train, and
will probably see you on the platform at York to give my
final directions. That's all. Go and see if the gentleman
who came with me has returned from the station."
In spite of the bright and characteristic letter which
Miss Desborough left for her host â letter which mingled
her peculiar shrewd sense with her humorous extrava
gance of expression â Consul spent a somewhat uneasy
evening under the fire of questions that assailed him in
reference to the fair deserter. But he kept loyal faith with
herâ adhering even to the letter of her instructions and dnly
once was goaded into more active mendacity. The conver
sation had turned upon "Debs," and the Consul nad re
marked upon the similarity of the name. A guest from
the North observed, however, that the name wan undoubt
edly a contraction. "Possibly it might have been 'Deb
borough,' or even the same name as our fair friend." "'
"But didn't Miss Desborough tell you last night that
she had been hunting up her people with a family tree, or
something like that?" said Lord Algernon, eagerly. "I
lust caught a word here and there, "for you were both
laughing." -vi
The Consul smiled blandly. "You may well say soâ for
it was all the most delightful piece of pure invention and
utter extravagance. It would have amused her still more
if she had thought you were listening and took It seri
ously!" - v<
. "Of course â I see!" said the young fellow with a laugh
and a slight rise of color. "I knew she was taking some
kind of a rise out of youâ and that remark reminded me
of it."
Nevertheless, within a year. Lord Algernon was happi
ly married to the daughter of a South African millionaire,
whose bridal offerings alone touched the sum of half a
million. It was also said that the mother was "impossi
ble." and the father "unspeakable," and the relations "in
extinguishable." but the wedding was an "occasion." and
in the succeeding year of festivity it is presumed that the
names of "Debs" and "Desborough" were alike forgotten.
But they existed still in a little hamlet near the edge of
a bleak northern moor, where they were singularly exalt
ed on a soaring shaft of pure marble above the submerged
'and moss-grown tombstones of a simple country church
yard. So great was the contrast between the modern and
pretentious monument and the graves of the humbler fore
fathers of the village that even the Americans who
chanced to. visit were shocked at what they believed was
the ostentatious and vulgar pride of one of their own
countrywomen. For on its pedestal was inscribed:

All the way from Minnesota to California in a tiny wagon drawn by dogs. It seems an impossible
feat to accomplish. But it has been done by Mr. and Mrs. Blandy and their baby boy, who are now so
journing in the vicinity of Sweetbriar Camp, preparatory to making a tour of the State. The Blandys made
the trip for the purpose of seeing the country, and after mature consideration concluded that dogs were
better adapted to the work than horses. The success of the journey has proved that they were rightjj'n
their judgment. On the way across the little party met with many adventures. They were attacked by
wild beasts and surrounded by wandering herds of cattle. They started nearly a year ago from Brain
erd, Minn.
TIIH only way I like apple sauce! i
is with breakfast bacon," said
Mrs. Blandy, as she sat on the
ground one evening, paring |
n apples and slicing them .
into an old milk pail. "And of course ;
we'll have this to-morrow morning. I
never prepare any farther ahead than!'
that. We can't carry things, you know. \'â 
We Just get what we can of game in f
the woods or provisions at the little ,
towm we go through, and we haven't i ,
gone hungry yet. One time, though,
in the Bad Lands of Dakota, we j i
couldn't get water for a day and ft
half."
â ;â  And so our hostess chatted on, per
â jfectty at ease, and the whole Blandy
family seemed possessed with a. spirit
of hospitality; and they made a pic
turesque siszht in their camp near the
bridge at Sweetbriar, Cal. Supper was
"over, and the pans and spoons care- i
â¢fully washed, hung upon their respec
tive hooks in the cuphoard, which was
no more or less than a series of shelves
.in the rear of the wagon, arrai
with a lid or door that let down as the
back of an express wagon does, being
supported by a stick when it reached
a horizoiu.il position, thus forming a
table. This table red and a
.few scattering utensils, not yet put
away, lay on the ground near Mrs.
Blandy and her given apples. "Baby"
Blandy, a boy of five years, also sat
near the apples and made many a
fruitless attempt to steal one when his
-mother's interest in conversation led
her attention away from the task she
was performing.

applications of tb s preparation every

suffering, and the faithful creatures
seem to like the operation, for they look
at their master with gratitude and af
fection.
. Beautiful, strong dogs! They deserve
â¢all the praises that their master and
mistress lavish upon them. "They're
way ahead of any horses," Mrs. Blandy
said emphatically, wht-n some one sug
gested that Shetland ponies would be
preferable. "Why, dogs will carry you
-. through the Bnow to a safe, warm place
â¢ and horses would give out on you. And'
.didn't we travel 210 miles on the rail
road? Hones couldn't walk ties and
carry you over long trestles a mile and
three-quarters in length, as our dogs
did! I wouldn't take fifty horses
for- one of our dogs." Would
I, Bruce?" and phi' patted a
great shaggy, yellow dog on the head.
And, Indeed, they are regular Klon
dikers, these cross-bred Newfoundland
and St. Bernard dogs, and th".v would
have taken a trip to the ioy north if
the Blandys had not changed their
minds and decided to remain in Cali
fornia for a time.
â¢ .'Neither the little wagon six feet long
and two feet wide in the wagon bed,
nor- the well-kept dogs, which could
. not be bought at any price from their
â owners, nor the " cheerful faces and
manners of the Blandy family give
evidence of the long, tedious travel
they have had. It is now nearly a year
since they left their home in Brainerd,
Minn., with this unusual rig and $25
In pocket, to attempt an undertaking
BY DOG TEAM
that people declared was impossible.
No wagers were made, no time limits
were given. Mr. and Mrs. Blandy
simply started out to do what they
were confident they could accomplish;
namely, to be drawn across the conti
nent l>y dogs for the purpose of seeing
the country, earning their living as
they progressed. Ami so they pushed
along, following the Northern Pacific
Railroad, and, not being pressed for
time, they traveled at a speed that was
convenient to the character of the
country they crossed â never traveling
less than ten miles a day, reaching a
dally maximum of fifty-two miles (at
em- time covering eighty-six miles in
two days) and stopping in towns to
Bell pictures or pick up a few dollars
by painting advertisements on the can
vas of their wagon.
Perhaps the most exciting event that
occurred was the encounter with wild
cattle near Medora, North Dakota.
These untamed creatures of the Bad
Lands attack a man or a dog with
ferocity and the Blandys and
dogs would have "never lived to tell
the tale" if it had not happened that,
at the time, they were leading a pony
which they had bought for f>o cents at
Steele, Dakota. He bit at the cattle,
wh<> have great fear of ponies, and for
fifteen milesâ the nearest ranchâ kept
them from* attacking the train. At
Livingston, Mont., the pony was sold
at a gain of ?S 50.
At another time while camping in
the Cascades of Oregon a California
lion hovered about all night. He came
so close to the camp that th. Blandys
could hear the tread of his feet on the
ground. But the furious barking of
the dogs and the three shots Mr.
Blandy fired into the air frightened the
beast away, so that no harm save the
loss of sleep resulted.
The journey across the continent has
been almost entirely devoid of acci
dents. The wagon looks too frail to
Stand the travel, but it is stout and
strong, having a steel axle and wheel
that are capable of carrying a ton.
The weight of the wagon itself is only
210 pounds. It contains one seat, which
is occupied by Mrs. Blandy and her
I son, who are both slim or they would
I not fit into the space two feet wide.
In front of this seat is the roll of
; blankets and tent upon which Mr.
Blandy sits to drive his six dogs. Un
der the seat a telescope basket of
clothes is carried and odd articles of
all kinds are tucked into odd corners
and crevices.
The Blandys always leave towns
amid a roar of cheers and laughter.
When they are about to start, Mr.
Blandy walks among his dogs, and,
stooping down, adjusts all their feet so
as to prevent the entanglement of limbs
in harness, quickly steps into the low
wagon, seats himself on the bedding
j and tent, and, with lines in hand, he
I calls to the dogs, and they are off.
There is nothing slow about these
dogsâ they trot off at a good gait, rais
ing a big dust, and never walking ex
cept when climbing hills. When asked
if he ever walks, Mr. Blandy replied,
"It would take a professional runner
to keep up with my dogs,"â but per
haps he finds the speed up hill some
times convenient for his own walking
and his dog's pulling. At any rate, all
the wonder-stricken villagers give the
Blandys a screaming send-off when
they are favored with a visit. You may
hear some one in the crowd remark
that "Blandy ought to be arrested for
cruelty to animals," but a look at the
well-fed and well-groomed dogs belies
these words.
An outdoor life seems to agree with
the Blandy family. Until the night
spent near Dunsmuir, when the little
boy complained, they had had no 111-

ness at all. They always sleep under
the stars, unless compelled by the
weather to raise a tent. Mrs. Blandy
thinks that she would suffocate if she
had to sleep in a house agrain. She is
a young woman, the picture of health
and contentment, badly sunburned,
but with handsome blue eyes, an intel
ligent and interesting face, and strong
personal magnetism.
They seem brimming over with their
travels, anxious to relate their experi
ences, and proud of the success they
have met thus far. In cities they earn
as much as $5 a day, and while in some
of the Northern towns their income
was $160 a month from advertising
alone.
They made the distance from Man
hatta on the eastern side of the Rock
ies, to Butte on the western side â 86
miles â in two days. The road here is
Bteep but exceptionally broad and well
bu!U. Three stages cross in twenty
four hours and people think nothing of
going from one town to the other in a
single day. The Rockies in this sec
tion of country are not at all as people
think they are.
The plans of Mr. and Mrs. Blandy are
very extravagant. They expect to
spend a year or two in California, re
turn to the East by a new route, travel
through Massachusetts, Ohio and other
States, where their relatives live, and
in th<> ilim. dim future they look for a
voyage across the ocean, and a journey
through Europe with the dog team.

WfiTER IN THE PHILIPPINES.
To look at the map one would sup
pose every Philippine Islander would
have rather more water than he need
ed. It seems that this is not so. In
the Youth's Companion, Charles B.
Howard, a former resident of Manila,
says, speaking of â¢ domestic cares:
"The most arduous duty of the servants
(each servant gets $4 a month) was to
provide the house with water, which
was brought every morning in a hogs-
head fastened to a handcart, from the
public fountain nearly a mile away. It
had to be carried laboriously upstairs
in buckets and emptied into an enor
mous porcelain tank, shaped like half
an egg-shell, which stood In a back
room, and contained the household's
daily supply for washing, cooking and
drinkingâ that used as drinking water
being carefully boiled and filtered.
When I first went to Manila I had no
idea how precious water was, and on
the morning after my arrival I rose
quite early for a bath. Now the usual
way of taking a bath in a Manila
house is to dip the water from the
tank with a big cocoanut-shell, and
pour it over one's body, but nobody
had told me that, and being delighted
with the appearance of the great tank
filled with clear, sparkling water, I
soused into it, and was having a
splendid time, when one of the ser
vants, named Felipe, hearing suspi
cious noises, came to Investigate. At
the sight of me he threw up his hands
in horror and dismay, and chattered at
me in Spanish, of which I did not then
understand a word. Finding his pro
tests of no avail, he rushed away after
an interpreter, and soon returned with
one of my messmates, who was very
sleepy and much bewilderedâ Felipe's
disjointed exclamations having made
him fear that something dreadful had
happened. He gasped when he saw
me, and then explained the situation.
STRANGE FOLK CURE
IN KANSAS.
SOME of these cures, which were
collected in CoTfey County, were
obtained from colored people. The
majority of the superstitions, how
ever, which were collected in Doug
las County, were obtained from people
who declared they knew no supersti
tions and believed none, namely, stu
dents in attendance at the University
of Kansas. These students came from
nearly every county in the State, writes
Gertude C. Davenport to the Journal of
American Folk Lore.
Warts can be transferred from one to
another by the following methods,
among others:
Put into a red calico bag hearts"
from grains of corn; "run down the
road"; throw away the bag, not look
ing where it falls; run home again, and
if any one picks up the bag your warts
will go away.
Rub the warts with seven pebbles;
wrap the pebbles in a paper and throw
them away; if the parcel is picked up
the warts will go away.
If you see any one asleep in church
say to yourself, "When you awake take
these warts."
If you have a wart and see a man
riding on horseback in the rain, or, as
another version runs, riding on a gray
horse, say, "Take these along," rub the
wart and it will leave you.
At Delphos, Kans., lives a young man
who gallantly procured his sweetheart's
warts by purchase.
Steal a dishcloth, rub the wart with
it and then bury the cloth mider the
eaves of the house. If you tell no one
and no one finds out your theft your
wart will go away.
Write on the stove with a piece of
chalk the number of your warts. When
the number has burned off the stove
your warts will be gone.
In order to cure the toothache cut
your finger nails on Friday. Another
sure cure is to wash behind your ears
every morning.
The skin of an eel, if worn about the
leg, will cure rheumatism.
Carry a potato In one's pocket to cure
rheumatism.
The skin of a black cat worn in one's
clothing will cure rheumatism.
The negro sometimes sleeps with a
yojung dog in order to transmit rheu
matism to the dog.
Headache may be prevented by wear
ing in one's hat the rattles of a snake.
The skin of a snake worn around
one's hat crown will cure the head

WHY THE QUEEN
CANNOT ABDICATE
There are not only pecuniary and
constitutional difficulties in the way of
abdication. The Queen, however, is
not only Queen of Great Britain and
Ireland, she is also Empress of India,
reigning over more Moslems than the
Grand Turk, and more Africans and
Asiatics than any other civilized mon
arch. Abdication would be misunder
stood by some and resented by all of
them: Death they know; a living ruler
they understand. What is abdication
to the border tribes of the Hindoo-
Koosh, to the lake-dwelle: : of Nyassa
land, Uganda, or the fierce tribesmen
of the Soudan? From an imperial stand
point a scepter dropped from the hand
of the Great White Queen can be
borne aloft in her lifetime by no suc
cessor. In many parts of the world the
British raj is personified in the little
lady who, sixty years ago, said to those
who told her that she was a Queen,
"I will be good." In some partÃ of India
she is actually worshiped as a goddess.
In her lifetime the native races of the
empire will either look to their Queen
as the ruler or they will assume that
something has happened that saps and
neutralizes British power. These
imperial considerations as to the
effect on Asiatics and Africans were
also in the minds of the Min
isters when they unanimously re
fused to advise the Queen to rest
from the crushing burden of the crown.

THE MAN WHO COOKS THE GRUB
We have read In song and story
Of "the man behind the gun,"
He 1b given all the glory
Of the battles that are won;
They are tilling up the papers
With his apotheosis,
And they tell about his capers
While the shells above him hiss,
But behind the grimy gunner.
Steadfast through the wild hubbub,
Stands a greater god of battles â
'Tis the man who cooks the grub.
When the sky is rent with thunder
And the shell screams through the air.
When some fort is rent asunder
And Destruction revels there.
When the men in line go rushing
On to glory or to woe
With the maddened charges crushing
Heroes who are lying low.
There Is one but for whose labors
There could be no wild hubbub,
And the greatest god of battles
Is the man who cooks the grub.
What of ships with armor plating 1 .
What of castles on the heights?
What of anxious captains waiting
While the careful gunner sights?
What of all the long-range rifles?
What of men with valiant hearts?
These were but impotent trifles.
But Inconsequential parts
Of the whole, without the fellow I
Who must scour, scrape and scrubâ
For the greatest god of battles
la the. man who cooks the grub.

WARNS AMERICAN HEIRESSES
AGAINST THE EUROPEAN NOBILITY
In Order to Prove the Truth of What She Says the
Countess Louveau de Chavanne Teffs of Her
Own Sad Experiences in France.
THE American girl in Paris," says
the Countess Louveau de Cha
vanne with gentle authority,
"who is anxious to 'get on in the
world' and is not over scrupu
lous concerning methods is, fig
uratively speaking, a modern Little
Red Riding Hood in an immense forest
full of wolves. She becomes the inno
cent, unsuspecting, defenseless prey of
a ravenous pack of hungry creatures
from the moment she steps upon a Pa
risian pavement."
So says the golden-haired daughter
of Captain Henry John Benson, for
merly of the United States revenue ser
vice, niece of the Most Reverend Ed-
ward "White Benson, late Archbishop
of Canterbury, and widow of Count
Louveau de Chavanne, who departed
this life some six years since, after re
ducing to zero the comfortable fortune
which she brought him at marriage.
The Countess is a widow now and is
paying a visit to San Francisco.
A native of Brooklyn, New York,
Ouirda Benson went to Paris when a
child under the care of Mrs. Torrence,
Commodore Vanderbilt's daughter. She
was educated in one of the most ex
clusive schools of that city. Soon after
her graduation she was married into
the French nobility. Her experiences
as the wife of this French nobleman
with a talent for squandering money
were such as to inspire her to write a
book which is designed to be a warning
to her American sisters.
The spirit of practical philanthropy
which earned for her in France the
decoration of the Fraternal Society of
Retired "Veterans of the Legion of
Honor, bestowed upon her by President
Henrlot Berthier, Mayor of Neuilly, an
imates the American Countess still, and
nearly every day has found her in at
tendance at the hospital tents of Camp
Merritt, where the sick soldiers have
learned to look eagerly for her coming.
The visit of la Comtesse to the coast
is intended as a vacation from her lit
erary work, and it is consequently a
trifle difficult to induce her to "talk
shop." Once persuaded, however, she
gives the fortunate listener panoramic
glimpses of certain phases of Conti
nental life which are particularly in
teresting because of the fact that she
speaks not of what she thinks and sur
mises, but of what she knows.
"When 'new' Americans arrive in
Paris," says the Countess, "their
names, places of residence on this side
and their Parisian address are at once
published in the American Register, a
newspaper which has a very large local
circulation, for reasons which you can
readily see. These names and partic
ulars are easily obtained at the bank
ing houses, where new comers general
ly report themselves at once, and are
invaluable to the class of people who
make a specialty of being attentive, for
a consideration, to wealthy and social
ly, ambitious strangers.
"Interpreters and guides flock to the
recent arrivals, proffer their services
and if engaged manage to learn every
thing possible concerning their em
ployer's circumstances, home standing
and society aspirations.
"This information has a distinct
money value and is made the most of,
but some of the titled society mongers
disdain such sources of knowledge and
prefer to form their opinions and plan
their campaigns from personal observa
tion and the prudent inquiries of their
own servitors. These ladies and gen
tlemen frequent such places as the
beautiful court and approaches to the
Grand Hotel, a recognized fashionable
rendezvous, and make acquaintance
with the right kind of people for their
purpose with consummate art and skill.
"Being careful to observe the out
ward form of the most punctilious and
ceremonious courtesy, the Parisian, af
ter some delicate preliminary skirmish
ing, calls upon the Americans, who are
generally only too delighted to be
taken up' so quickly and kindly by
persons of genuine rank and social
prestige. A pleasant intimacy Is at
once established and the obliging new
acquaintance takes his or her American
friends about, secures them presenta
tions and invitations, and is extremely
useful in a very delightful way. But
all this does not. as it seems to. spring
from mere enjoyment of the charm of
American companionship.
"When Madame la Marquise intro
djuces her new American intimates to
her own modiste, or her especial trades
people,' she receives a substantial com
mission from her tradesmen for this
little act of kindness. When she deli
cately hints that for some special oc
casion toilettes of particular elegance
are necessary, the purchasing of those
toilettes adds a goodly sum to her store
of ready money.
"While the tradespeople of France
are, as a rule, fair and honest in their
dealings with their customers who
come to them direct, the pernicious sys
tem of commissions insisted upon by
many of their fashionable patrons
when recommending others to purchase
of them results in overcharges. These,
however, are smilingly paid, since the
patronage of so distinguished a person
as the introducer guarantees to the in
troducee that the establishment is the
'proper thing' in its line.
LA COMTESSE LOVEAU DE CriAVANNE.
The Countess is now visiting: relatives in California. She comes of a
wealthy and well known. American family. While very young and an heir
ess S he was married to a member of the French nobility. He squandered
her fortune before his death, and now the Countess is writing a book
warning young American heiresses against foreign marriages. She has a
great deal to say about the way in which rich American women visiting
Europe are preyed upon by vigilant sharers.
"Opera boxes are rented In Paris by
the year, and if well manaered can be
made quite paying investments. For
instance, the Marquise Ac St. Paul, aa
aristocrat to her finger tips, does not
feel like going to the opera every night;
every night Is not fashionable, so some
disinterested third person suggests to
the American acquaintance that it
would give her and hers a very de
sirable social stamp to be seen in the
box of the Marquise.
"The matter of money is easily ar
ranged; it would be a graceful ac
knowledgment of the Marquise's
courtesy in allowing them the use of
her box to contribute a certain sum to
that lady's charitable fund, and the
contribution is made most willingly.
The Marquise, however, being a firm
1 believer In the adage that 'charity be
gins at home,' profits personally and
satisfactorily by the transaction.
"Where there is a daughter ambitious
to own a title, a wider field of opera
tions is entered upon. There are crowds
of impoverished scions of noble families
who are only too willing to barter po
sition for wealth, and one of these be
ing selected as eligible he is obliged to
sign a regular contract specifying ex
actly how much of his prospective
wife's fortune he will pay to the aristo
cratic match-maker In the event of his
marriage to her 'dear young American
friend.' Sometimes, where there is a
dowry, the amount is paid down, and
agaiii it is paid so much by the month,
so that there are many American girls
who, quite unconsciously, have literally
paid for their husbands 'on the install
ment plan.'
"So legitimate is this business con
sidered that when I left France for
America certain persons coolly hinted
to me that I might enjoy a good income
would I but keep them informed au
thentically concerning the eligible heir
esses over here, their fortunes, personal
characteristics and whereabouts. They
themselves undertook to manage the
European end of the busineris, and
guaranteed that financial success would
be positively assured to such a high
class matrimonial agency.
"It is needless to say that I declined
the offer. I have seen too much misery
come from such marriages to endeavor
in any way to increase them.

LILLIAN BURKHART.
WHAT surprises me most is
the open way in which vice
is flaunted on some of the
city's principal streets.
With an escort I began the
tour of all the so-called con
cert halls. Some of them are within
the -borders of respectability, first-class
music is furnished and several of them,
in addition to their orchestra, give
quite a fair vaudeville <'how. The turns
presented, while not great, possess the
merit of cleanliness, and beer te sold,
I understand, at the same price all over
the house.
In Paris in a free theater of the same
appointments as the Olympia the price
of drinks depends entirely upon the
auditor's nearness to the stage. For
instance, at the Cafe dos Ambassa
! deurs, a concert garden, oft the Champs
i Elysses, a splendid vaudeville bill is of
j fered. Yvette Guilbert and the best
vaudeville artists on the Continent ap
pear there during the summer. Added

COMPARES THE SLUMS
OF
PARIS AND SAN FRANCISCO.
What Lillian Burkhart Saw on a
Night's Expedition in
Each City.
LAST week Lillian Burkhart, the act
ress, went slumming in San Francisco.
She had been on a like expedition
when on a visit to Paris, and conse
quently drew a comparison between
the wicKedness, poverty and crime of the two
cities. Her conclusions after her trip were
that there is nothing: she heard and saw in
Paris that has not its counterpart here, with
the exception that the Parisians have a cer
tain polish and chic even in their naughti
ness. Where the Parisian is chic, the lower
class American is vulgar; whore the Paris
ian is risque, the American is coarse. Here
is what "she has to say as the results of
her trips':
and players. The admission is free,
but if you are fortunate enough to get
a seat near the stage a glass of root
beer ur a glass of absinthe or plain
lemonade will cost you at least eight
francs, or $1 60 in our money. A seat
in the back of the garden may be had
for a franc, about 20 cents.
In the box to the right of us in the
Olympia the other evening sat a
woman of about '.:2 <>r 33 years of age.
She was dressed quietly and sat alone
with a glass of beer In front of her â
which she had forgotten to drink. I
noticed her at first because her cheeks
were not rouged; she looked tired and
rather lonely. I wondered if she was
waiting for some one. Finally a woman
dressed very loudly passed with three
men. The flashily gowned woman
called out to the lonely one in the box.
"Why, hello, Miss Smith, what's you
doing here? What time to-morrow will
you send my waist home?" The woman
hailed as Miss Smith flushed at finding
so many pairs of eyes turned upon her,
and said, "You shall have it at 3 to
morrow afternoon. I come here every
night just to hear the music. It rests
my head after listening to the sewing
machine all day."
Leaving these places one walks
straight across the borderline of re
spectability and vulgarity into vice
that is positively shameful. My cheeks
burned and my ears tingled from the
things I saw in one resort, and not far
from Market street either. Would such
a place be allowed on one of the prin
cipal thoroughfares of London or
Paris? No, Indeed!
On another main thoroughfare. Kear
ny street, there are resorts which, if
they exist in counterpart in Paris or
London, are certainly in some section
of the city not easy of access to strang
er's. What impressed me most strongly
was the large number of sold ers to be
found in one and all of these dives. In
one cellar at least twenty were present
â drinking, smoking and dancing with
the female habitues of the resort. It
made me feel ashamed and ardently
wish they were in civilian clothes. Then
again, it seems so dreadful, looking at
these young boys, many of them fresh
from the country, knowing little of
vice in any form, to be plunged In a
moment into such fearful dens of in
iquity. In Europe you do not see sol
diers in uniform frequenting such places,
for when they go they leave their uni
forms, the one mark of their nation's
love and pride, at home.
At one music hal! on Kearny street
(the dingy boxes on each side partially
screened by very dirty lace curtains)
a woman of about 40 years of age and
two hundred pounds of avoirdupois
visited us for a moment. She glanced
at me and said, "You're from New
York, aren's you. Miss?" I nodded as
sent and she said most ingratiatingly,
"I know you; I have ceen you before.'
You're Miss Russell."
I immediately smiled radiantly, think
ing she meant Lillian Russell, the well
i known prima donna. I only weigh 120
pounds and the fair Lillian would prob
, ably make three of me, still to have
I any one find even a faint resemblance
' to the beautiful singer was decidedly
\ Mattering. I began to look on my ques-
I tioner more kindly, when she said:
! "Yes, you're the dead image of Queenie
j Russell. She used to do a barefoot
; dance in Chicago â and gettin' good
j dough for. it, tooâ when she got stuck
! on a sowing machine agent and skipped
I the town. Now, what do you think of
I that for a guy?"
I refused to think at all and arose
to go, whereon she looked us all over
carefully and said: "What! You
| hain't going, are you, without treating
to wine â and youse dressed up in all
those togs, too." Running ahead of us,
sho called the apparent proprietor â a
man grown prematurely old and gray,
and who looked more like a hero in a
cheap melodrama with his white hair
and dark-ringed eyesâ and the two

THE LATEST FAD
INJECTING PERFUME
THERE is talk of a hypodermic per
fume fad. Eastern society is re
ported to have taken It up. Women
are said to be flocking by hundreds
to the place of "business where the
perfume is administered.
By the use of the surgeon's hypodermic
needle a society girl who desires to faint
ly radiate the odor of violets as she
comes into the drawing room may do so
âat least, that is the supposition.
The advantages of having one's own
delicious individual odor seem alluring,
but the hypodermic needle brings with it
numerous suggestions as to pain and pos
called after us derisively, "Cheap guys,
they travel on their shape."
I concluded after the above episode
I had all I wanted of that style of en
tertainment.
As long as I live I shall never forget
the sight I witnessed in one alley. No
drama ever written ever can or ever
will tell such a story of vice and shame;
perhaps the women are unworthy or
pity, but I cannot believe it. The taw
dry women in the music halls did not
appeal to me half as strongly as these
poor, painted, forsaken creatures.
Surely some great philanthropist, sofme
great man or woman, will awaken to
the life work awaiting them here in San
Francisco.
The quadrille dances at the Moulin
Rouge in Paris did not impress me in
the same way, though their lives are
pitiful enough, tooâ but they seem to
glory in their degradation, and after
viewing their exhibitions one only feels
disgust and nausea. Writing of the
Moulin Ro-uge reminds me of a question
I asked my dressmaker while in Paris.
I asked if it was safe for a lady, ac
companied by a gentleman, to go to the
Moulin Rouge about midnight, and she
replied: "Oh, yes, mademoiselle. It
ees aulte safe. Ze girls will not trouble
youâ it ees ze man zey are after. Oh,
you will find it what you call In Eng
lish wicked â you will ace lingerie

so far as producing the desired perfumed
result?
I determined to Investigate.
I would ask the doctors, first, as to the
fad's practicability and, second, as to its
results, good and bad.
"Well," said Dr. William G. Moore of
Vandeventer place, "if you have the gen
>ulne missionary spirit and really desire
to know all you can about this hypoder
mic perfume notion, the best thing you
can do is to try it for yourself. Then
you're in a position to defend It or to de
nounce it as a foolish and dangerous
practice. I myself incline toward the
latter view.
"But everything should be given a fair
test.
"Are you willing and anxious to be the
means of preventing a lot of women from
engaging in a harmful practice?"
I wasâ well, willing is a little too strong,
and anxious Isn't a fitting term at all.
One can't exactly approach a state of
anxiety to do a thing when by doing it
one may engage in a discussion with
blood poisoning later by the calendar.
No, I was not anxious, but I was
agreed.
"Get the best quality of perfume you
can find, of any strong scent," said Dr.
Moore.
I went out and bought two drams of
violet from the nearest druggist, after
some questions as to its purity. The
shopman could not answer positively as
to the latter, because it was an Imported
article and he didn't know all its Ingre
dients, but he felt reasonably sure that
the proportion of impurities was small.
plenty." I can only add that we did
see lingerie plenty and it was all as she
said.
A trip tc- Chinatown was the most
marvelous part of our evening's Jour
ney. Its herded population, opium
fiends, its women imported and sold as
slaves, the peculiar odor in the air,
make one marvel at the city's freedom
from pestilence, but I suppose the pure
air from fresh coast winds keeps the
place exempt from any scourge or con
tagious disease.
When we turned our faces toward the
Baldwin Hotel again at the conclusion
of our journey I was obliged to admit
with reluctance that there is nothing
I heard ur saw in Paris that has not
a counterpart in San Francisco, with
this exception â that the Parisians have
a certain polish and chic even in their
naughtiness, and this redeeming fea
ture. If it be such, is totally lacking
here. Where the Parisian is chic the
American is vulgar; where the Parisian
Is risqi c, the American is positively
coarse.
San Francisco is a gTeat and wonder
ful city. We Easterners are inclined to
think the pivot around which revolves
all that is best in literature, art and
commerce is New York, but when we
get here we are obliged to acknowledge,
in the slang parlance of the day, that
"there are others."

! Tin*, little dress was made of Scotch
â¢ Madras, which is a material with several

mains the same which is highly desirable

'always Ideal for this reason.
The little dress above referred to was

trimmed with white needlework of open
pattern. The needlework was arranged
to form a point in the front; it was full
at the shoulders and two rows^of it lay
one over the other, making a sort of
shoulder epaulet.
With the little dress went a collarette
of mull, which was to be worn when the
little girl was on dress parade. The collar
ette consisted of two mull ruffles shirred
upon a broad scarlet ribbon which was
tied at the back of the neck. When the
little girl was at play this little collarette
could be taken off, showing the neck of
the dress, finished with a very tiny band
of white insertion.
The dress had every color In it, and any
hat could be worn with it. 'I should ad

trimmed with a great bunch of cerise rib

however, lens desirable than the plaids.
Scarlet, blue and white plaids are very

Home-made stockings should be made

1 WONDER how many of my beauty
seekers, in using the various recipes
that I have given them, combine with
their use a strictly hygienic method
of living? I think that I have not
sufficiently emphasised this point.
The skin must be kept in a. state of ab
solute cleanliness in order to perform its
proper functions, which can only be ac
complished by the daily sponge bath and
a good, hard scrubbing with hot water,
r r soap and a flesh brush at least once a.
week.
The blood must be kept from getting
sluggish by plenty of exercise regularly
taken, and it must- be kept in a state of
perfect purity by strict attention to the
diet. Overeating, irregular eating and
indulgence in rich foods, pastries and hot
broads do more damage to fair, soft skins
than anything else, for they cause various
forms of Indigestion and invariably
make the complexion coarse, high col
ored and greasy, and bring blackheads,
pimples and all sorts of unsightly erup
tions. "Women never seem to understand
'that beauty food can be put into the
stomach as well as smrared upon the
face. All the beauty pomades and local
applications in the world will have no ef
fect unless these general laws of health
are religiously attended to.
Another thing that I have not before
spoken of is this: Women do not drink
enough water. At least three pints of
filtered water should be drunk each day.
Hot water is better than cold, particular
ly early in the morning. It is a good plan
to take a cup of hot water a half-hour be
fore each meal and before retiring. Take
from five to fifteen minutes to drink tne
water. It will wash from the stomach the
mucous, alcoholic and sour yeasts and
t)o not nibble sweets at odd hours. If
you must nibble between meals, then let
it be fruits, nearly all of which are nu

upon her own physical perfection,

Many women there are who are already

tuce,- watercress and all green salads are
also excellent for the complexion, and an
occasional teaspoonful of olive oil Is pood,
too. '
Last, but not leant, beauty-sreking fem
ininity must indulge In lots of sleep. With
out this natural restorative great physi
cal beauty is out of the question. Tired
nerves and brokendown tissues are cer
tainly not conducive to a high form of
beauty, and in ord^r to keep the exhaust
ed forces of the body in proper repair
sleep is absolutely necessary.
A certain amount of tissue is destroyed
and vitality exhausted each day that
must be renewed. During sleep all volun
tary movements are suspended, but the
vital functions of respiration and circu
lation are still carried on, although less
rapidly.* Consequently, a reserve force is
accumulated ready for the demands of
the next clay, and one awakes rested and
refreshed.
Some people require more sleep thnn
others, but every one should have at
least eight hours, and ten, to my mind, is
not too much. A good rule is to retire
promptly at 10 each night and rise at 8
the following morning. The hours from
10 to 12 are thought to be those in which
the most repair Is made, and hence the
sleep gained in them is called the "beauty
sleep. I knew a woman once who made
it a rule to retire regularly every night at
9 o'clock, with the exception of one night
In each week, which she kept as a recep
tion night for her friends, or in case she
cared to spend an evening out. She never
let anything interfere with this rule. And
I assure you that her complexion rivaled
in fairness, smoothness and fineness of
texture the most exquisite piece of Pa
rian marble, and she attributed most of it
to her religious regularity in this one re
spect.
Perfect ventilation is an absolute ne
cessity in the sleeping apartment, for, If
there is not sufficient oxygen to purify
the blood properly one will toss restlessly
to and fro t d sleep, if not altogether Im
possible, will be so disturbed that it will
be of little benefit. Have the pillow Upon
which you sleep just high enough to raise
the head so as to be even with the
\
itself like an echo of the far past, "How
these things do stretch and pull out of
shape!" This is the trouble
with unlined sleeves made of thin ma
terial, that pretty mode that intensifies
the beauty of curves and whiteneÃÃ of
skin beneath.
It is in the pulling on and off that tight
sleeves have been torn and spoiled. A new
method of adjustment, recently concocted
by a clever little woman who thinks, and
which has been quickly adopted by several
of the leading dressmakers' establish
ments, is designed to do away with this
wear and tear and inconvenience. The
new sleeve has but one seam, and Is made
a full inch too loose for the arm. Down
the outside of the seam is sewn a very
fine cord of silk elastic. ThlÃ is twisted at
intervals of half an inch or less into small
raised loops. The elastic must match ex
actly the color of the gown. Parallel with
the range of loops and separated by an
inch from it Is a row of tiny buttons. Is it
not simple? The sleeve, amply large, is
drawn on with ease; then the wee elastic
loops are slipped over the buttons, that
correspond with them in numbers, and the
sleeve becomes tight. In removing the
loops are first unbuttoned, and the sleeve
is saved from stretching.
It is a practical idea and one that can
be easily followed, and will be appreciated
by any one who has ever ruined fine
sleeves in the donning and doffing.

with the fingers, which have also bHen
dipped in the Chalk, pluck them out. It is
only fair to tell you that after this ih-:y

was given in the Sunday Call, August 14.
MYRTLE E.â The formula that you ask
for is: Gum tragacanth, l\i drams; proof
spirit, 3 ounces; attar of rose, 3 drops:
distilled water, 7 ounces. If It should
show on your hair a little brushing wilt
remove it. For dandruff, wash the hair
every two or three weeks, using the fol*
lowing as a shampoo: Yelk of one egg,
pint of distilled water, and one ounce
rosemary spirits. Beat the mixture thor
oughly and use It warm, rubbinr it well
into the scalp. Be sure and rlnee the

quantities denotes a disordered physical
condition. Be careful as to diet, take reg
ular exercise and keep the skin in good
condition by taking a daily tepid sponge
bath. I would also advise you to take
syrup of hypophosphates occasionally,
and to drink orange phosphates before
meals. Massaging the scalp gently with
the fingers, which have been barely damp
ened in lukewarm water, will invigorate
the hair roots. Try this tonic:
Bay rum. one pint; aldohol, one-half
pint; castor oil, one-half ounce; tincture
cantharldes, one-half ounce; carbonate of
ammonia, one-eighth ounce. Mix well and
apply to the scalp every other night, mas
saging with the finger tips.
ClTYâ Benzoin diluted in water is a
good skin tonic, but must be used with
discrimination. Its qualities form a new
epidermis, and if the old skin happens to
be in a condition to be cast you will look
as though you were shedding your com
plexion. This, of course, if you use too
much of it. Be sure and get the simple
tincture, and the proper proportions are
about a tenspoonful to a half pint of
water. The best way to use it is to have
a slight quantity of it incorporated in your
cold cream and use that every night. I
doubt if it will positively prevent wrinkles,
but it may help. The tiny hairs will re
turn and the operation will have to be re
peated, probably about once a month. The
lady about whom you ask Is interested in
the business, which is carried on under
her name only to the extent of allowing
her name to be used. The firm went into
bankruptcy a year or so ago and was sold
out. since when she has taken no active
part in the business.
W. C. GREYâ Please see advice given
to Despair, only "instead of using the
tonic prescribed for her try this for the
falling hair and dandruff:
Eau de cologne, 8 ounces; tincture
cantharides. 1 ounce; oil English laven
der, V 4 dram; oil rosemary. *fa dram.
This is particularly good for dry. harsh
hair. Apply merely to the roots once or
twice.
TROUBLESâ In setting up paper last
Sunday my letter to you became discon
nected in some way. The oatmeal lotion
which tumbled over into the next column
was what I prescribed for you.
SILVEIA DAWNâ Here is the formula
for rouge paste: Melt 2Vi parts white
wax. 50 parts spermaceti. 50 parts oil of
sweet almonds. When melted add drop
by drop 33 parts rosewater. Beat briskly
with a silver spoon or an egg beater, and
when cold beat in enough powdered car
mine to color properly. The longer this is
whipped the finer and better it will be.
In answer to Belle in issue of August 14
I gave directions for making the skin
food. No doubt you saw it. The orange
flower water must be added, drop by
drop, but quickly enough to got it all in
while the cream is hot. Be sure and
warm the jar slightly before putting it in.
If it does not mix properly you can al
ways melt It a second time and beat over
again. I did not give you formula for
Almondlne before, because I did not know
It. nor do I yet. Tell the brother to read
foregoing reply to W. C. Grey for treat
ment of dandruff.
M. A.â l confidently assert that there is
nothing that will actually restore the
color to gray hair. Tho only cure is the
temporary one of a stain or dye. Prema

plied to the roots of the hair. Rubbing
claret into the scalp will, by strengthen
ing and invigorating the hair bulbs, often
bring back the natural tints. The fol
lowing hair tonic is excellent:
Two drams tincture cantharldes. six
drams essence of rosemary, eleven ounces
elder flower water. I beg of you not to
use any of the so-called "restorers." One
of my correspondents has written to me
that she used one and it rotted her hair
to such an -extent that she had every
reason to fear that she would become
bald. I hope that you will get some
comfort ont of the treatment I have pre

you regain your, health the things that
cause you so much worry now will ad
just themselves. Cease worrying and
fretting. You will never regain your
fresh, youthful appearance until you do.
As your hair is a golden brown, I would
advise using the plain claret on
it, omitting the iron. This lat
ter has a slight darkening effect,
and as your hair is already too
dark at the roots, I would not advise It.
Please read what I have said to M. A. on
this subject. Keep the hair in a state
of perfect cleanliness, by frequent brush
ing and a shampoo whenever necessary.
Try the egg shampoo, which I ,iave sev
eral times given recipes for. It will be
particularly beneficial in your case,
can tell you of no way to lighten the
roots of your hair except by bleaching,
and I should not advise you to
commence anything of that sort,
for, of, course, as the hair grows
out. it will still be dark at the roots,
and the bleach would have to be ap
plied over and over again.
I think a little lemon juice and rosewa
ter applied to the end of your nose for
several nights will remove the discolora
tion in the pores. If It makes the skin
tender, apply cold cream. I really can
not recommend any patent dye or "re
storer." You say that I advised a cor
respondent to use a good dye on the
eyelashes. If you will read that letter
again you will find that I advised it for
the eyebrows and not the eyelashes.
I particularly said that it was not to be
used on the lashes. Massaging the throat
with the orange flower skin food should
make it firm and pretty again. Here is
the formula for a very excellent cucum
ber cream:
One ounce almond oil.
One ounce green oil.
Two ounces juice of cucumbers.
One ounce white wax.
One ounce spermaceti.
Two ounces essence of cucumber.
The rose leaf lotion will keep for some
time; the brandy, of course, preserves it.
For the brittle nails, I would suggest that
you apply, every night before going to
bed a good cold cream, rubbing it Into
the nail so that it is absorbed. Then,
when you are able to get out, go, once a
week, to a manicure who thoroughly un
derstands the treatment of nails In the
condition that yours are.
MRS. L. X.â Burning pains in the feet
are sometimes caused by Imperfect cir
culation. Indigestion also causes them at
times. If from the latter cause remedy
that and tne effect will disappear. Try
bathing the feet in a solution of boracic
acid, and if that does not relieve them
I will tell you of something else.

Skiagraph Taken on Board the United States Hospital Steamer Belief,
Showing the Course of a Bullet That Finally Lodged in the Arm.
Special to The Sunday Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â Dr. William M. Gray of the
hospital* ship Relief found time the other day to
talk of the part that surgery has played in the pres
ent "xar and the Influence of new scientific appli
ances as tested by practical experience in making
the lot of the wounded men easier. Dr. Gray is the mi
croscopist at the Medical Museum at Washington, and was
detailed by this institution for surgical work in the war
with special reference to the diagnosis of gunshot wounds
by the Roentgen rays.
"One thing this war has taught, " he said, "is that the
probe In all its forms has gone out of use. No more search
ing blindly In a man's body for the bullet, n<> more danger
of blood poisoning from the Introduction into the wound of
Instruments In search. The Auoroscope tells us instantly
where the projectile has imbedded Itself, and we have only
to out it out a* if it were there before our eyes. The in
genious electric probe and all similar devices have seen
their day. In all future battles experts in sklagraphy will
be attached of necessity to the medical corps, and the work
of the surgeons will be materially assisted by their precise
indications. We took out bullets by the pint on board the
Relief, and almost without exception they were located by
the X-rays."
The surgeon exhibited the apparatus for producing the
X-rays and the operating table where the skiagraphs are
made. These stand amidships in an open space ranged
about with hospital cots. Dr. Gray explained that, excel
lent as the results have been so far, they will be better
in the future, since the Relief starts on her new cruise
with much improved X-ray appliances. In the developing
room he showed a number of X-ray plates, such as were
prepared for the surgeon's guidance; those cannot fail to
furnish interesting data for the BUrgical history of the war.
It seemed that valuable time might be lost in making
these pictures and the doctor was asked about it.
"It Is all done in a few minutes." he said, "five seconds
for a wound in the hand, thirty seconds for one in the foot,
and not over ten or fifteen minutes for a wound through
the thick pelvis. The patient is stretched out here, the
X-ray bulb adjusted over the wound like this (see illustra
tion i. the plate put under the limb or part where the
wound \s, and the thing is done. The plates are developed
almost instantly. In many eases we save hours of vain
searching: not infrequently we save the soldier's life.'*
Then he went on to tell of a remarkable case where a
man wa.s wounded in the right shoulder by a Mauser bul-

let. which plowed Its way on around the chest walls under
the deep muscles and lodged In the left arm, shattering the
humerus.
"Here was an odd condition, a wound In the right
shoulder, but no bullet, the bone of the left arm broken,
but no wound. How long do you suppose it would have
taken to find that b-illet by probing? It did not take us
one minute to find it with the X-rays. Here It Is In this
picture, you see It there quite plainly."
He handed over a skiagraph, reproduced herewith, that

shows the fractured humerus and the imbedded bullet, as
If the arm were transparent. It was simply a matter of a
few cuts and the bullet was out.
"Did the bullet do no harm, doctor, in going through
the body?"
"Apparently not; the man made little complaint, and is
doing nicely; we have had more remarkable cases than
that of Mauser bullets passing through the body and doing
no harm. One man was shot through from side to side,
with both lungs traversed, but he had no symptoms, not
even any bleeding. There was just a small red spot where
the bullet went in and a Bmall red spot where it came out.
If his leg had not been cracked by another shot he would
not have been In the hospital. We had two cases on the
ship shot through the intestines, but showing no smyp
toms, one case of a man shot through the liver and kidneys,
with no symptoms, and one very remarkable case where
a bullet entered the left chest, passed through the body
and out of the abdomen, went through the air for a foot
or so and landed in the right thigh, about half way to the
knee. The man must have been stooping when the bullet
struck him."
Another case, which caused some discussion among the
surgeons, was that of a man shot through the breast on
the left side, the bullet entering about a quarter of an
inch below the nipple and passing out at the back, shat
tering the shoulder blade. The point of exit showed that
the bullet took an upward course, which made it certain
that it passed very close to the point of the heart; indeed,
It is an open question whether it did not actually pass
through the heart. The doctors are agreed that it passed
through the pericardium, or covering of the heart, and
Major George H. Torney, the surgeon in command of the
Relief, is inclined to believe that the heart itself was pene
trated.
"It Is conceivable." he said, "that a man may live as
this one did, even though a bullet has gonr through his
heart. We must suppose that the bullet struck the heart

WINNERS OF THE WORLD'S CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP.
Dr. Tarrasch of Germany won first prize and Mr. Pillsbury, representing America, won second prize at the
World's Championship Chess Tournament just finished in Vienna.
THE most closely contested chess tournament for the
world's championship that has ever been seen has
Just closed with great brilliancy In Vienna. America
barely missed winning first honors. One of her rep- i
resentatives, Harry S. Ptllsbury, and Dr. Slgismund
Tarrasch, Germany's great player, kept within half a point !
of each other throughout the long struggle of thirty-eight
rounds. At the close of the series they were tie.
The Judges decided that they should play a match of
four games to decide who should take first and second
prizes. Tarrasch won the first and third games, Pillsbury
the second, and the fourth was draw. Th<? final score was:
Tarrasch, 2*4 ; Pillsbury, lVfc. Tarr_sch received first prize, |
$1500; Pillsbury second, $1000.
Henry N. Pillsbury was born at Somerville. Mass., and
will be 26 years old In December. He became famous as
the winner of the first prize at the Hastings tournament,
defeating the world's champion. Since then he has de
feated Showalter twice for the championship of the United j
States, and now adds to his laurels by hla great fight with
Dr. Tarrasch.
Pillsbury's chief characteristic is his perfect sang froid.
He never slights the ability of his opponent, whom he in
variably sizes up carefully. His style is energetic and very
correct. There are few who equal him in the knowledge
of the openings, and his middle game maneuvering is
superb. His endings are scientifically exact.
Following is his tournament record:
1893â First prize, New York City Club masters' tourna
ment.
1895_First prize, Hastings.
1895â Third prize. St. Petersburg.
IR96â Tied for third place with Tarrasch at Nuremberg.
1896â Third prize at Budapest.
1898â Tied for first place with Tarrasch at Vienna,
Dr. Tarrasch Is Just ten years older than Pillsbury. and
Is a native of Breslau. When only sixteen years of age he
was a good chess player, and exhibited extraordinary in
tellectual endowments. In 18SR. being twenty-three years
of age. he took his degree In medicine. In 1884 took first
prize and secured title of master In Nuremberg. In 188?
played in the Hamburg Chess Congress, in which he showed

just as it was drawn hard together in its closest contrac
tion. It is very likely that if the same bullet had come
when the heart was on the other beat, and therefore dis
tended and softer, it would have been so badly torn that
death would have ensued."
Dr. Gray explained that most of the operations were
performed at night, as the days were crowded full receiv
ing the wounded.
â¢'Even so. we were not rushed," he said. "On the aver
age we had three or four operations each night, sometimes
as many as six. You see, the emergency work was done
on the field before we received the wounded. We had
plenty of time to work carefully."
"Did you use ether?"
"No; chloroform. It is better on shipboard, as it is
not so inflammable and takes up less space. We had no
deaths from the anesthetic."
"Did you have to operate in bad weather?"
"No, we were fortunate In having a smooth sea; it
would be impossible to operate in a storm; the patients
would have to wait."
"How many nurses had you on board?"
"About thirty â ten men and twenty women. We shall
have a larger proportion of women nurses on the next
cruise." It seemed to be the general opinion among the
doctors that the wounded can get no care like that which
women give. But the doctors are equally positive in de
claring women out of place on the field of battle. "They
can't stand the horrors of It," said Major Torney; "they
are too sensitive."
One of the surprises of this war to the surgeons has
been the failure of the Mauser bullet to do such work of
bone shattering and general destruction as had been proph
esied for it. The result of many experiments made before
the war had been to satisfy experts that this small bullet
with its velocity would do more damage to the human body
than had Â«ver been done by any other bullet. Mauser bul
lets had been fired Into bags of sand and cans of water and
cadavers with such a splashing and plowing and splinter
ing as to cause them to be looked upon as most formidable
engines of carnage. And yet in real warfare, when prac
tically tested upon the bodies of our men, these bullets
have by no means shown the viciousness expected of them.
"You know they told us," said Dr. Gray, "that the
Mauser bullets would make a small hole where they entered
the body, but would come out through a hole big enough
to put your fist in. Well, nothing of the sort has happened
in ca.ses under our observation. On the contrary the hole

berg. First prize in the Breslau Tournament, 1S89; the
Manchester Tournament, 1890, and the tournament in Dres

Dr. Tarrasch has the unique reputation of being the
greatest amateur chess player in the world, for he cannot,'
In any sense, be called a professional. As a player he ex
cels In what may be called chess knowledge. Always
analytical, never very brilliant, he plays for a position or
combination that gives safety to his gartie and at the same
time allows him to force his opponent. This short sketch
of the German doctor would be incomplete if we did not
add that he is one of the most genial and gentlemanly
players that ever sat at a board.
D. Janowski, the French champion, who took third prize,
exhibited an ability which marks him as one of the world's
great players. He defeated in successive rounds Pillsbury,
Tschlgorin. Schlffers, Tarrasch, Alapin and Walbrodt. He
Is a dashing player, always dangerous and fights as long
as there is the shade of a chance.
W. Steinitz won fourth prize, C. Schlechter fifth prize,
M. Tschigorin and A. Burn divided sixth honors and P.

The prizes were awarded as follows: Tarrasch first,
he having beaten Pillsbury in the tie match; Pillsbury
second, Janowski third, Steinitz fourth, Schlechter fifth.
Burn and Tschlgorin divided sixth and seventh. Llpke and
Maroczy divided eighth and ninth and Alapin took the
tenth. The three special prizes for having made the best
scores against the ten prize takers were awarded to Black

of exit has often been quite as small as the hole of entry.
Take that case I mentioned of the man shot through from
side to side, there was no difference in the size of the two
holes, and both were very small.
"They told us, and seemed to prove it by experiment,
that the impact of a Mauser bullet against large bones or
against the skull would cause a frightful splintering of
the bone or cranium. I remember a case where a doctor,
for sake of experiment, fired Mauser bullets into a human
leg only a few minutes after its amputation, and the bul
lets did certainly shatter the bones in a most alarming
way. But in practice, under Spanish fire, the Mauser bul
lets have shown less shattering power than our own Krag-
Jorgensen bullets. Mauser bullets fired into the skulls of
cadavers splintered them into fragments, but Mauser bul
lets fired into the skulls of live Americans in many cases
made only two clean holes."
"And did the men live, shot through the brain?"
"lit one or two cases they did, but most of them diod
from the poisoning of foreign matter brought into the brain
with the bullets. As far as the bone-shattering went they
might haÂ» r e recovered."
"Have you any theory, doctor, to account for this dif
ference between what was expected of the Mauser bullets
and what was actually done by them?"
"I can only suggest that the trouble may have been with
defective ammunition used by the Spaniards. Perhaps the
bullets were not really driven against us as hard as is sup
posed. You see, Mauser bullets are counted upon to kill
at thirty-five hundred yards, and most of our men w;r>re
wounded at distances varying between five hundred and
one thousand yards. Very few were wounded under fivf>
hundred yards, for the simple reason that when we got as
close as that the Spaniards ran. It is rather odd, but tru \
that Spaniards wounded under the same conditions as our
men usually show worse wounds. This is one of the puz
zles of the war that experts will have to work out."
Lieutenant Colonel Senn. chief of operating staff with
the army In the field, has been with the Relief, and sai's
with her again. Dr. Senn explains the fact that so larp^
a proportion of bullets as 10 per cent remained in the bodi^
of the wounded on the assumption that many of those bul
lets, before striking the bodies In which they lodged, had
been Impeded' or deflected In their course by stones, tref-s.
underbrush, etc., on the field. This would seem to be in
dicated by the bent or flattened condition of many bulle's
found embedded in soft tissues. Dr. Senn sees no reason
to doubt that the modern elongated bullet will become
encysted in the body as readily, perhaps more so. than the
old-fashioned leaden bullet. All patients treated by him
for gunshot wounds in the spine, where the spinal cord was
seriously damaged, have died or will die in the near future

to San Francisco, will be the bill begin
ning to-morruw night. It is by Brander
Matthews and George H. Jessop, authors
ot "A Gold Mine." if! which Nat Go

opposite of "Aristocracy," as the motive
is to ridicule thai class <>;' rich and idiotic
Americans who fall down and worship
any one that comes to them with a title,
whether it is inherited, purchaw
stolen. The scenes art.- laid in Paris, and
the plot centers in a group of Americans

Mr. Bilsbee, a ilirtatluus and cxci edlngly

Sarah Bernhardt's London engagement
has been extraordinarily successful, ana
her endurance is as wonderful as ever.
One of her programme consisted of Oc
tave Feuillefs three-act comedy, "Julie,
a piece full of morbid passion, and "La
Femme de Claude.' She played both
heroines without a trace of exhaustion.
At latest accounts she was to give a
series of "flying matinees" in the prin
cipal towns of England and Scotland.
Many Italians of the younger genera
tion had their first opportunity on June Id
of hearing Adelaide Ristori on the stage.
Notwithstanding her age and her infirm
ity, she made the trip to Turin, where she
recited the fifth canto of Dante's "Infer
no" at the Carignano Theater. Though
her voice was weak, the dramatic genius
which had made her world-famed still an
imated her delivery, and made the audi
ence wild with enthusiasm. The actress
made a short speech, in which she said
that she would remember this occasion to
her grave, which was not far off.
That the Chinese play fad is not dead
is evidenced by the fact that "A Celestial 0
Maiden," the work of Charles Ulrich, a
well known local newspaper man, is to
open its second season on the road at
"Woodland on September 5. The play was
produced with success at Oakland in
July, 1597, and since that time has been
presented 169 times, in all the principal
cities of the coast and Middle West. Its
reception everywhere was such that man
agers are now requesting return dates.
The play has been booked solid for twen
ty-five weeks in the leading cities of the
Pacific Coast.
Much has been heard of late of an ex
traordinary creature named Diligentl. She
used to act in barns with vagabond play
ers. She has recently drawn great crowds
in Monte Carlo. One of her roles Js Ham
let. She is said to be ugly and old and of
unwieldy dimensions, but she electrifies
her hearers. Her rendering of Hamlet
was a revelation to the oldest play-goers.
As Queen Elizabeth in an old-fashioned
melodrama, which concludes with the
death of the Queen, deserted by her cour
tiers, after her discovery that Essex had
indeed sent her the ring. La Diligent! rose
to unparalleled tragic heights. Her ef
fects of horror were bloodcurdling.
Howard Paul has compiled for thÂ«
Home Journal some facts and figures re
garding the system of subvention in
France. The total amount given annual
ly by the Government is $326,000. The
Grand Opera receives $160,00ft v the Opera
Comlque $60,000, the Comedie Francaise
$40,000 and the Odeon $20,000. In addition
the sum of $38,600 is appropriated toward
the maintenance of the Conservatoire.
After a thorough examination of the sys
tem of state-aided theaters, Mr. Paul
reaches the conclusion that it is ineffec
tive. The directors at the opera find it
hard to make both ends meet, and were
it not for foreign visitors the other sub
ventioned houses would seldom prosper.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. 20.â Wheat traders had
nothing but bearish news to begin with, but
the opening prices were a shade higher than i
were current at last night's close. The appar- j
ent strength was of short continuance. Prices j
for the active futures got to %c below the
highest notch of the opening In about 10 min
utes and %c under Friday's closing rates. The
influencing factors were of both foreign and do
mestic origin. Quotations from Liverpool were
%d down for September and %d for December.
The Italian crop was estimated at from 116.
000,000 to 120.000,000 bushels, compared with 92,
000,000 the previous season. The fliost striking j
item of news from domestic sources was that i
Minneapolis and Duluth received 435 cars I
against 145 the preceding Saturday and 243 cars
the corresponding day the year before. The
spring wheat market was very unsettled In the
car lots crowd and much of the day's receipts
being ' tough and damp. It was difficult to get
buyers to make any kind of a respectable bid
for such. The close was 1%@1%c lower for Sep
tember and %c for December.
Continued fine weather, a slow shipping de
mand and the weakness in wheat had a bear
ish Influence on corn. The general tone of the
market was easy, although December Increased
Its lead over September slightly as the result
of rather extensiveâ changing transactions,
commission houses taking December and selling
the near-by delivery- September lost %cÂ«
Oats again demonstrated' their ability to fol
low corn. Trade, however, was very light. Sep
tember lost H@Vic on the day.
An advance In , prices for live hogs at the
yards favored provisions at the commencement.
Prices soon yielded, however, under pressure
of offerings from buyers on yesterday's break,
â who were disposed to accept what profit they
could find. Pork left oft 15c lower, lard 124e
and ribs 10@12%c lower.

f.-HE excitement in the city of San
"â  . I-., .tiago de Cuba was intense. From
â : : |. '.the heights 'back of the city the
... -t, Spaniards daily watched the as
â'; sembllng of a great fleet of American
â¢....war .vessels, under â  ie command of Ad
â¢' jriiral. Sampson. Everyday the city
â -â - shook" to the sound of bombs which,
â¢flying over the doomed place, shrieked
'â  out their message of wrath. They gave
'"evidence that the Yankees were trying
â¢ the range of their Teat guns.
'.;â¢. Occasionally-, but not often, the guns
â¢ of Morro Castle, at the entrance of the
4 harbor, made sullen reply. A fleet of
: : Spanish warships, under the command
.of Admiral Cervera lay at anchor in
the .bay. The coming of these" vessels
"had been hailed by the Spanish soldiers
â¢â¢in the city with joy, for thej- had fondly
: imagined that the fleet was more than
â '.a' match for any fleet that the Amer
icans could bring against it. Now that
â¢â the" Americans were guarding the
.'. mouth of the harbor, to keep the Span
â  ifih. squadron from sailing away, the
'â¢soldiers began to murmur because Cer
. veramade no attempt to go forth to
. -fight.
â¢ In a private room in the Palace of the
"."Governor of the province of Santiago
â de Cuba we now see. General Linares
â¢and Admiral Cervera sitting in council.
LITTLE GIRL OF OAKLAND.
THE funniest little girl of them all
Is the Oakland girl. I guess.
She learns to race when she is small,
And can beat the fast express.
.â¢ â¢ â  For the first thing graven on her small brain
Is, "We must catch the ii:ii train."
And all her nights and all her days
Are haunted by some old clock,
Whose every tick too plainly says.
'"The train is on the next block."
â  .â¢ And oft she jumps, grabs her dolly's clothes,
"â¢' ' And says, '"Tis time to run, I 'spose."
An orderly sergeant announces that
â  ' -'Sen or Carvaljo wishes to speak with
â¢General Linares, the commander of the
' .Spanish army in the city. He is bid
' ":Oeri to enter and he shortly is engaged
' :in,.fonversation with the Spanish com
â  ; ina-nders.
â .'â¢;* .-'-you bring late news from the front,
â¢isf-nor?" asked Linares.
'YeS; the American soldiers are
. â  Steadily advancing. They have landed
â¢ ; JJoVOQO â ' men at Baiquiri. I hear that
â  th?re is a large fleet of transports on
the /way. bringing other thousands."
â¢: : "'Let them come," said Linares grim
jy.:: ."â¢Since the great fleet of Admiral
: O-rver'a's command is not to go forth
â to drive away the American fleet, per
haps the admiral will be able to help
.. l:^ with his big guns to hold the city
a'g-a'inst the attack by land."
'How Is that?" demanded Senor Car
: vaJJo. "Has the fleet been ordered not
â  i&'.go out?"
. ; The general's lips trembled with sub-
: du'ed. excitement, but his answer was
-sarcastic. "This is a safe place for the
fleet," he said with a sneer; "here the
admiral can rest for a time, after his
dangerous voyage across the great
:bcean^"
-,; Cfervera leaped to his feet and his
iight hand was upon the hilt of the
by his side. "Enough, brave
7?r-neral," he said; "no longer will you
'have an opportunity to hint at coward
ice :oh my part. Were the occasion dlf
â ierent you would be compelled to take
â¢ back your words. As it now is "
."'The sentence was never finished.
Admiral Cerverajpose to go. His face
!. : was flushed with anger and he con
trailed his temper only with much dif
ficulty.
. ."Gentlemen*" interposed Senor Car
valjo, "this is no time for the friends
Vbf Spain to quarrel. The King has no
' .friends that he can spare. Save the
erl-g.es of your swords and also of your
â ts for the Americans."
â¢ His words prevailed. General Lin
ares and Admiral Cervera resumed
â .â¢â¢their conference. Offl'ciaJ .secrets were
-folly considered. Senor Carvaljo had
â¢â ' the full confidence of both commanders.
...He was not a Spaniard. The com
manders of the Spanish army and navy
â  thought that he was a Mexican. lie
.had. brought from General Blanco let
.-. terÂ«- telling of a Mexican expedition
: 'vrhlch' would come to the aid of the
Spanish in Cuba. Sc-nor Carv;tl)o vras
.'-gent ahead <>f the expedition to make
arrangements for the Mexican volun
teers-. So ran the letters of General
.Blanco to General Linares, and Gen
. eral Linares believed.
'â¢ Look carefully at Senor Carvaljo as
he -passes out from the council cham
â¢ ber, after he hae learned all the plans
of the Spaniards. Have you ever seen
â¢him before? Surely there Is .somehing
â familiar in the brave eyes which now
have -.a iook of triumph in them. This
,fenor Carvaljo is no other than the
..'.ring Harry Ostend! How adroit and
'.daring he is you may not have known
â¢fully. Once his identity is known to the
Spaniards, his life is not worth a rush.
â¢Knowing all this he is playing a great
.part for the sake of his native land.
â  The smile upon his handsome face is
I
natural. In fact he feels no fear.
How he made his way to Havana;
how he gained the confidence of Gen
eral Blanco, and succeeded in learning
all the secrets of the defenses of that
city; how he managed to carry his In
formation under cover of night to the
blockading American vessels off Ha
vana; how, finally he arrived with
Blanco's valuable letter of introduction
at Santiago de Cuba and there entered
upon the work of a spy to furnish in
formation to Admiral Sampson and
General Shafter of the American in
vading force is a long story, which can
not be told here. His future movements
are of more pressing importance.
"You leave us to-night, senor?" asked
Linares as Mr. Ostend left the room.
"Yes; time is precious. My men must
have landed secretly, and I go to hurry
them forward to the defense at Santi
ago."
"Beware of the tricky Americans.
These were the last words of Linares
as Mr. Ostend mounted a fleet horse.
Mr. Ostend answered, "I think that I
know a Yankee trick or two myself."
As Mr. Ostend rode out through the
eastern approach to the city a solitary
horseman passed him. The stranger
started in his saddle with an uncon
trollable impulse. His movement was
noticed by Mr. Ostend, whose watch
ful eyes observed everything that came
within range of the vision. He. was
surprised because he could not remem
ber that he had ever seen t.is person
before; but the acts of the stranger
had betrayed clearly that he recog
nized Ostend.
"The dangers around me are thick
ening," he thought as he rode for
ward more rapidly. I must hurry or
that man may prevent me from mak
ing my expected visit to Â« Admiral
Sampson."
The stranger in turn hurried on. He
evidently knew all the roads to San
tiago and he was saluted by several
officers as he passed, indicating that
he was a person of importance. Once
he stopped to get from an officer the
word which would permit him to freely
pass all the sentries. This was given
without hesitation, and he spurred on.
He went directly to General Linares'
headquarters and asked to see the
genera] upon important business.
"Welcome, Ramirez," said the gen
eral as the new-comer entered â for the
stranger was no other than the treach
erous Cuban, who wae now acting as a
Spanish spy.
"Thanks, general, but I Save come
to tell you that a most dangerous
American spy has just left the city. I
!: â  ' him as T rode in."
"A spy â who is he â this wonderfully
THE MflD CHASE OF THE BUMPKINS BY LAND AND BY WATER IN fllD OF THEIR UNLUCKY LANDLADY.
dangerous person?"
"He is none other than Ostend, who
is the most skillful and daring; of all
Americans engared In the secret serv
ice."
"We will see."
In a few minutes a Spanish sergeant
at the head of a squad of Spanish
horsemen dnrted from tho city in hot
pursuit of Mr. Ostend. Beside the ser
geant rede Ramirez. He had again to
plan to save himself from possible
vengeance for the death of Binnie and
Ned, for he supposed them to be dead.
Ostend would learn the truth the spy
knew: but with Ostend in the hands
of the Spanish as a spy to be tried and
convicted there would be nothing for
him to fear â only the Senorita Julia.
Where was she? Seizing fresh horses
in relay as they rode on, the Span
iards had no difficulty in gaining upon
Mr. Ostend. In fact^ as they fired their

pistols to attract his attention, he
turned in his saddle. Realizing the
situation, he reined in his horse on the
crest of a hill. and waited for his pur
euers to come up.
The Spanish spy glared at him tri
umphantly as Mr. Ostend was taken
back to the city as a prisoner. As they
rode a bomb from an American ship
fell near them and exploded. The
Spaniards scattered one and all. Mr.
Ostend only smiled coolly and made no
attempt to escape. It was nierht be
fore the party were fairly in the city.
Acting under the direction of Ramirez
the Spanish s-rgeant took Mr. Ostend
to a dungeon, in which hf was to pass
the night, it being too late to disturb
the easy-going and banauet-loving
General Linares, who was then enter
taining friends at dinner.
Mr. Ostend slept as quietly and
sweetly in his dungeon cell as he might
have slept at home or upon the yacht
California. His position was truly criti
cal. In a few hours General Linares
would learn that there were no Mexi
cans coming to his rescue and that the
story Ostend had been compelled to
tell to tret his confidence was false.
Then Ostend would meet the tragic
fate of the other spiesâ he would surely
be shot â unless Binnie should come
upon the scene.
His thoughts traveled to Binnie and
his last thought before he went to sleep
was of Binnie, coupled with the wish
that the adventurous lad and his com
panion Ned might be safe; and that
they might not be brought into dan
gers which they could not escape by
following out his own instructions to
them to meet him upon the road over
which he had been traveling when he

was made a prisoner.
When the moon rose late that night
the light of the orb fell upon three per
sons who were Journeying on horseback
along the road leading to the eastern
approach to the cty of Santiago de
Cuba. One of these was a girl. The
others were dressed as Spanish sol
diers. One wore the uniform of a
Spanish captain. The other was dressed
as a private in the Spanish infantry
service.
The officer led the way into the city
and drove them to the prison in which
Mr. Ostend was a prisoner. He led thÂ«
way through the stone corridor and
the light of a lantern fell upon the face
of the girl. It was the Senorlta. Julia!
The officer took a receipt from the
jailer for the prisoner, and he th^n
disappeared in the night.
How did Julia come to be in this
perilous position? She, who was known
to be the holder of all the secrets of the
Cubans who lived in the mountains of
Eastern Cuba! She, whose services for
Cuba were considered to be no danger
ous to the Spanish arms that General
Blanco had sent out a party to take her
prisoner! She was here a captive. Who
wan the officer who had found her and
brought her here! DisguiÃe himself in
the Spanish uniform as he may he can
not deceive vs â not even when he has
fastened to his face these fierce Spanish
nuiHtuchlos. He is Binnie â and his com
rade, he who is dressed as the private
Spanish soldier? He is surely Ned.
Wonder of wonders and horror of hor
rors! Can it be that Binnie and Ned
have turned traitors to Julia and to the
cause of Cuba?
When the guard was changed in the
dungeon that night a sentinel stopped
in front of the coll where Mr. Ostend
was in durance, and looked with poor
ly disguised surprise at the prisoner.
EDITED BY
DAVID H. WALKER
Mr. Ostend awoke suddenly. He saw
the eyes of the sentry and knew him.
From his pocket he took a fragment of
paper and speedily wrote upon It these
words:
Admiral Sampson: Cervera and Lin
ares have quarreled. Cervera will seek
instructions from Spain to dash from the
harbor to escape. I am a prisoner, held
as a spy; may be shot to-morrow. %V atch
for Cervera. HARRY OSTEND.
This he passed to Ned, who was by
chance the sentine-l. He took it and
concealed It carefully. Soon after the
sentinels in the Jail were again changed.
Harry Ostend was awakened by the
sound of riile shots. These continued
some minutes. Ned had succeeded in
petting away on a log in the darkness
and had drifted down in range of an
electric searchlight on Morro Castle.
The Spanish sharpshooters who were
doing guard duty saw the log and
opened fire upon it. Ned realized that
his only chance to escape upon the tide,
which was running out. toward the
American fleet, was to keep perfectly
still. Thus he might escape notice.
Around him the water bubbled with the
bullrts, which came uncomfortably
close, singing very spitefully. Twice
the log was struck. Then a keen pain
shot through Ned's form. He knew
that he had been shot in one arm â his
right arm. Still he was motionless and
did not cry out. The tide ran quite fast
and he was soon out of range of the
searchlight. The Spanish soldiers did
not send out a boat, having been con
vinced that what they had fired at was
only driftwood.
Far, far away glimmered the lights
of the American fleet. Ned now fear
ed that he would be compelled by weak
ness to let go his hold upon the log.
The wound that he had received bled
steadily. He was not to end his career
bo. An American launch, manned by
men from the battleship Oregon, was
out scouting. The low cry that Ned
made for help was heard by the men
on the launch. He was taken on board
and carried the message that Harry
Ostend had sent to Admiral Sampson.
Ned went to the admiral's cabin and
delivered his message. Then, over
come by the loss of blood, by his exer
tions and the excitement and fatigue
of several days of work, he reeled and
fell fainting into Admiral Sampson's
arms. The admiral gave an order that
he should be well cared for, and Ned
was placed in a bunk upon the flag
ship.
It is necessary to explain here how
Blnrrie, Ned and Julia came to enter
the city of Santiago de Cuba in the
manner already narrated. Julia dis
covered that the two boys were alive
in the canyon where the Cubans and
Spanish troopers went down. She
nursed them carefully back to life.
They had no bones broken, and, re
markable to say, neither was found to
be seriously hurt. At the end of a few
days they were ready to go forward
together. They all agreed that the
most important service they could per
form for Cuba at that time was to Dre
vent Ramirez from telling all that he
knew about the Cuban mountaineers.
Having this end in view they directed
their way toward Santiago de Cuba.
To enter" the city Binnie devised the
plan of a disguise for himself and for
Ned. He still had in his possession the
letter in which General Blanco had
authorized the unfortunate Spanish
cantain to arrest tho Senorita Julia. It
was a bold venture to go into Santiago
as a Spanish officer, but the boldest
plan was undoubtedly the safest, under
all the circumstances.
Ned was now safe for the present;
but what of Julia and Mr. Ostend?
What of Binnie? Ramirez was in the
city, interested in the fate of Mr. Os
tend. Ramirez misrht know Binnie and
betray him. Binnie could not go away
until he had tried to have Ramirez pun
ished. For this purpose Julia, Binnie
and Ned had taken such great risk.
Julia was a prisoner that Binnie might
have an excuse for being in the city.
Would they all be shot? The day to
come might bring disaster to all.

DOLLY ON GUARD.
Cozy in a corner of the big lounge she
lies.
Sleeping in the shadows of her tight
closed eyes;
Dreaming of play and the long, long day.
And her dimpled little dollle, who never
runs away,
For dollie keeps so still, and eyes opened
wide,
And she couldn't go to sleep if she tried!
Oh, you know, it wouldn't do for the two
to doze.
For rats might nibble the little girl's
toes â
Right through her shoesâ or brother
might come
With the rubby-dum of his new snare

So, dollie, with pride, keeps her eyes open
wide,
And watches and waits at the little girl's
side.
THE CHIPMUNK'S STRIPE.
By MINNEHAHA.
Once upon a time the porcupine was
appointed to be a leader of all the ani
mals. Soon after his appointment he
called them all together and presented
the question, "Shall we have night all
the time and darkness or daylight with
sunshine?" This was a very impor
tant question, ajid a violent discussion
arose, some wishing for daylight and
the sun to rule and others for contin
ual night.
The chipmunk wished for night and
day, weeks and months, and night to be
separate from the days, so he began to
sing "The Light Will Come: We Must
Have Light," which he continued to re
peat. Meanwhile the bear began sing
ing, "Night Is Best; We Must Have
Darkness."
While the chipmunk was singing the
day began to dawn. Then the other
party saw that the chipmunk was pre
vailing, and was very angry, and their
leader, the bear, pursued the chip
munk, who managed to escape uninjur
ed, the huge paw of the bear simply
grazing his back as he entered his hole
in a hollow tree, leaving its black im
print, which the chipmunk has ever
since retained. But night and day have
ever continued to alternate.
LITTLE TIP'S TRICKS.
BY E. L.
WHEN papa brought Tip home
first he just didn't know any
thingâl mean Tip didn't. And
papa said to me:
"Tip is only a young pup,
Ethel, and you can easily teach him
anything you wish. He will be a well
behaved or a badly behaved doggie,
Just as you make him."
I thought it would be great fun to
teach Tip to be good, but, myâ what a
bother that dog was. He was lots worse
than takinp care of a doll. You have
to put a doll away when you have done
playing with it. for fear the baby will
get it and break its head, and you have
to remember not to leave it out on the
grass, for fear it might get rained on,
and things like that. But, dear me,
Tip was worse than a dozen dolls.
When I got tired of playing with
him I couldn't put him away, like I can
Laura Louise, for he would follow me
all over the house, whether I wanted
him to go or not. Very often I did
want him, but sometimes I didn't. He
would shake shoes or hats or anything
he could find about, and although I
whipped him for it lots of times, he
kept on doing it whenever he got a
chance.
Once he trotted after me down to
Mollie Foster's house. Mollie wanted
to show me her new wheel, and while
we were looking at it Tip pulled down
Mollies new summer hat from a chair
and before I could stop him he bit off a
big mouthful of daisies.
Mrs. Foster said: "Gracious, what a
bad dog! Don't brine: him here again,
Ethel!" I didn't blame her much, and
Tip had chewed up all the daisies be
fore we could get them away from him.
Well, that made ir.e feel very bad, of
course. I never thought Mollies hat
was very pretty, but it looked awful
after Tip eat up those daisies. Mamma
offered to buy Mollie some new flowers,
but she wouldn't take 'em. She wore
that dreadful hat for at least a month.
I couldn't help laughing every time I
saw it.
After that I tried harder to make Tip
behave. It took me six montliJ to teach
him not to tear up things he found on
the floor. And I think even now he
shakes things when I'm not looking at
him. I wonder if mothers have as much
trouble with their children as I have
with Tip? And sometimes mothers
have six children. Gracious! Suppose
I had six Tips, and had to make them
all behave. How awful it would be!
But Tip did learn to behave himself
all tie better as he got older. One use
ful thing I taught him I must tell you
about.
Tip always loved to run out in the
rain. When he came into the house
again he would walk with his muddy
feet all over the carpets and curtains.
Sometimes he's jump up on the chairs.
Mamma told me how bad it was of
Tip and how dirty he made the furni
ture. She drove him out of the parlor
lots of times, but he would come in
again.
So I thought I would teach Tip to
wipe his feet on the door mat when he
came In from out of doors. I took him
COME right here, yo' picanniny, what's de matter wif yo' now?
Shet yo' mouf an' stop dat makin' of a' everlastin' row.
What's de matter wif yo' apron? Why it's wringin' soppin' wet;
Tells yo' not to play in wata'; but yo' ebry day forget.
An' I clar befo' de Lawd, I gwine a beat yo' black an' blue;
Fo' dabblin' in de wata.' 'til yo' close is soppin' frough!
What yo' fink my time is good fo'* Jest to wash and iron yo' close?
Fse gwine a verigate yo' body, from yo' neck down to yo' toes.
Twasn't wata'! Fink I'se b!in\ chile? Wata'â melon did yo' say?
An' yo' "broder's got de odder half"; go call him right away.
Tell him bring dat here dis minnit; tell him bring it here to me,
An' I let yo' off dat whippin', jest fo' mercy, do yo' see?
out in the rain one day and Ralphâ
that's my big brotherâ saw me go and
he said:
"What are you going to do, Ethel?"
I told him I was going to educate Tip
and he said he'd come out and see me
So I let Tip get his feet awful muddy
and then I took hh.i to the door mat
on the porch and wiped his feet again
and again till I made him understand
what I wanted him to do.
Ralph stood and laughed at me while
I was doing it and every time Ralph
laughed Tip would stop wiping his feet
LITTLE GIRL OF BERKELEY.
THE Berkeley small girl knows the most,
That's what the small boys say.
The mortar board's her choicest boast,
And it makes her cute and gay.
And she knows all about when the term begins,
And who the football championship wins.
At six she gets a taste of "ology,"
At seven she knows a few small isms.
At eight she owes to none apology â
Her mental lights are clear as prisms!
Next year she ransacks Poesy's shelf;
One reason may be she's Nine herself.
and bark at Ralph. It was awful hard
work, but I did make Tip know what I
meant when I said:
â¢'Wipe your feet. Tip!"
Then when I told him to do It himself
he struggled and tried to get away and
acted just like a bad little boy that
doesn't want to learn his lesson. But
I persevered, though Ralph laughed
and Tip barked and I felt very hot and
uncomfortable all the time. I made Tip
know what I meant, and then I made
him do it when I told him.
After that, whenever Tip ran into the
house with muddy feet, if mamma or
I said to him: "Go, wipe your feet,
Tip!" he always ran out to the door
mat and wiped them. It was such fun
to see him do it!
Papa says Tip taught me ac much as
I taught him. I don't exactly know
what he meant. But I often wonder
if mamma had as much trouble teach
ing me to be good as I have teaching
Tip.
It was a very hot day, and little Hel
en having noticed her father looking at
the thermometer several times, asked
him about It. "When it's away up,"
he replied, "the weather is hot and
when it's away down it's cool." When
he went to consult it again later it had
disappeared and he asked Helen what
had become of it. "Why," she replied,
"I took zat old fermometer way down
in ze cellar, so it would det tooler."
WALKING IN
THE COUNTRY.
BY ALMA D. AHLERS.
ONE morning we got up very early,
because we were going to the
country. On the way we noticed
many beautiful birds chirping
merrily in the branches of the
trees. Some bad boys were throwing
stones at the birds. The mother bird
was afraid that she could not get the
little birds to fly away with her. After
a little while the boys went away. Then
we went on, and saw some cows.
Finally we came to a little brook,
where horses came to quench their
thirst, and we were so hungry that
we sat under a tree to eat our lunch,
because it was so cool. The flowers
were very beautiful, and the grass was
so high that Mary's little feet gpt
twisted in the grass and she tripped.
She fell, but did not pet hurt. We made
wreaths of flowers and twined them
around our hats. The orchard . was
filled with pear trees, and we went in
and got a big pear and ate it. The
grass was green, and there were little
hills around. We rolled down the
hill, and the little children found it
much fun. lfi!>3B

THE CHILDREN'S FUN.
The late Bill Nye was fond of telling
this story of his little daughter: At
the dinner table one day there was a
party of guests for whom Mr. Nye was
doing his best in the way of entertain
ment. A lady turned to the little girl.
"Your father is a very funny man."
said she.
"Yes," responded the child, "when we
have company."
It was the first time Johnny had ever
heard a guinea hen.
"Oh, ma!" he shouted, "come and
hear the chicken a-windin' itself up."

AT BABY'S BEDTIME.
By EBEN E. REXFORD.
This is baby's bedtime;
My little one comes to me
In her snowy little nightgown.
And kneels down at my knee:
And I fancy a sweet chlld-angel
Is for a time my guest.
And she says her little prayer over
With her hands upon her breast.
"Now I lay me," she whispers,
In low voice, "down to sleep;
I nray the Lord"â and the blue eye*
Half close â "my soul to keep.
If I should die"â Oh! the shiver
At my heart! â "before I wake
I pray the Lord!" â and the eyelids
Droop lowâ "my soul to take."
Then I lift up the little one, clasping
Her close to my loving heart
And give her warm good-night klssea
Till the closed lids break apart
As the leaves ao folding a flower.
And the violets of her eyes
Look up in their drowsy fashton.
And smile at me angel-wise.
"Dood-night," she whispers me softly
And sleepily, with a kiss
That lingers with me in slumber,
And stirs my heart with bliss.
As I think of the little one, dreaming,
With her head against my breast;
Till my sleep is as full of rapture
As her dreaming is of rest.
"Ma, can't I go to the show and see
the wild man?"
"No, child. I'll do the best I can for
you. I'll iron all the buttonholes out of
your father's shirts."
SHE WENT OUT TO TEA.
"My little girl, I hope you tried
Your very best to be
Quite ladylike and well behaved
When you were out at tea.
"And that you said 'Yes, if. you please,'
When things were offered you;
Or, 'No, I thank you,' quietly.
Just as I told you to."
"Well, mamma, dear, I smiled and said,
'Yes, thank you,' so polite;
And, 'If you please," and sat up straight,
And always acted right.
"I didn't say, 'No, thank you," though.
Because, mamma, you see
I wanted all they helped me to-
When I went out to tea."

TRACKS TOBN UP.
The Horse-Car Rails Removed From
Market Street Between Sixth
and Eighth.
A gang of sixty city workmen, under
direction of Superintendent Ambrose, be
gan work early yesterday morning tear
ing up the horsecar tracks on Market
street, between Sixth and Eighth, and
within an hour the work was completed
without interference from the streetcar
company.
The exclusive announcement in The Call
yesterday that the tracks would be torn
up by the city authorities attracted quite
a crowd of spectators to the scene with
the expectation that trouble might oc
cur, but they were doomed to disappoint
ment. Superintendent Lynch, of the
Btreet railway company, was present, but
made no effort to stop the work. On
Monday the old rails will be stored in the
corporation yard as a fitting finale to the
end of tho horsecar system on Market
street.
That the streetcar company proposes to
fight for damages in the courts Is evi
denced by a communication addressed
yesterday to the Board of Supervisors,
stating in substance that the Market
street corporation has an unexpired fran
chise for operating said tracks and de
clines to remove, or permit their removal.
Notice is served that suits for damages
will follow action t>y the city in remov
ing the tracks.
CHIEF LEES' ARMS .TIED.
While He Is Restrained Ferdinan
Will Bury Himself.
While the arms of Chief Lees and
hit* men are tied, and their interference
prohibited by a temporary writ of In
junction issued by Judjra Daingerfield
last week, Albert Ferdinan will bury
himself alive in a lot he has selected in
which to lie him down, on Market street,
near Larkin. The grave will close over
the â¢ daring hypnotic subject this after
noon at 3 o'clock, unless the Chief de
cides to risk the wrath of the court and
stop the performance.
Friday Judge Seawell heard argument
on behalf of the Chief to dissolve the
injunction issued by Judge Daingerfield,
but will not decide the case until Tues
day. This fact interferes with the pro
gramme of Ferdinan, and, acting under
the advice of his counsel, he has de
cided to go into the grave while Judge
Daingerfield's order is still in force. In
consequence. If Judge Seawell dissolves
the injunction next Tuesday. Lees and
his men will have to dig up the sleeper
and restore him to the bosom of his
family.
Catherine E. Gregory's Will.
The wtll of Catherine E. Gregory, who
died in this city on the 16th inst.. was
filed for probate yesterday. The exact
value of the estate is at present un
known. The testatrix bequeaths her
adopted daughter. Charlotte B. Greg-ory,
one-half the entire estate, the residue
going to Robert Ash. In her will Mrs.
(Gregory states that "in event any man
or woman should come and claim and
obtain possession of her adopted daugh
ter they must take her at; penniless as
I did. and the above bequest to her shall
go to the Catholic Orphan Asylum in Vir

Yes, to-morrow, Monday, we start on our Fall campaign: nov-
elties are coming in every day; to-morrow we display the new
creations in Fall dress goods and they are so different to what
we have seen for so many seasons that we are enthusiastic
over them ; they were bought by us direct from the manu-
facturers, and these were our orders :
"Give us better dress goods than we've ever handled before. Give us exclusively rich patterns in a wide range.
Give us dress goods that will make women stop on the street to glance at the made-up costume. Give us
honest goods. We'll pay for first pick." We're satisfied, ladies â now come and see these goods. We have
other equally good surprises in store for you â one of which will be our fall millinery opening!
