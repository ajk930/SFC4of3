sent in to him to telegraph his Government as to surrender

GENERAL SHAFTER'S HEADQUARTERS
BEFORE SANTIAGO, July 7, by Herald-Call
dispatch boat Somers N. Smith, via Port An
tonio, Jamaica, July B.â During a truce
which General Shafter effected with Gen
eral Linares, the American land and sea
forces have perfected plans to deal a crush
ing blow to the city of Santiago on Saturday.
General Shafter has succeeded
in getting his siege guns into
commanding positions at the
front, and Sergeant Hallett Al
sop P. Borrowe now has his dy
namite gun repaired and in posi
tion on San Juan Hill. Our
troops also have fortified them
selves with protected rifle pits,
from which they will be able to
do the enemy much harm, with
out themselves being especially
exposed to the enemy's fire.
In addition to these advan
tages, gained on land by General
Shafter, he has arranged with Ad
miral Sampson for the fleet to
participate in Saturday's attack
on the city. As I have shown in
previous dispatches, it has been
impracticable for the fleet to shell
Santiago from the bay, owing to
the presence of mines and the sta
tioning of 500 riflemen to protect
the mines. To get around this
difficulty, Admiral Sampson has
decided to bombard Santiago
from off Aguadores, from which
point the guns of the fleet will be
able to do great damage to the
beleaguered city.
General Shafter has been hold
ing off to give General Linares
time to think over his hopeless
situation and afford an opportun
ity for the Archbishop of Santi
ago and foreign consular repre
sentatives to exert their influence
for peace. The truce proper end
ed at 5 o'clock yesterday after
noon, but an hour later General
Shafter sent a letter to General
Linares, announcing the destruc
tion of Admiral Cervera's fleet
The San Francisco Call
and again suggesting the surren
der of the city as a matter of ur
gent military expediency.
I am not informed of the exact
contents of General Shafter's
communication, but I am told by
a reliable authority that it sug
gested that General Linares send
an officer through the lines to
consult with Admiral Cervera at
Siboncy.
In his reply to this letter, which
General Shafter received early
this morning, General Linares
declared that his sense of military
honor required him to defend
Santiago to the last, and that he
could surrender the city only
when forced or bidden to do so
by superior authority.
General Linares' pride gradu
ally is giving way under the men
tal strain he is subjected to and
the depressing influence of his
painful wound. He is be ng
strongly urged to surrender by
General Toral, the next in rank,
who is known to be anxious to
yield to General Shafter.
Tremendous pressure un
doubtedly is being brought to
bear on General Linares to in
duce him to surrender. But he
still is stubborn and wants to
shirk the responsibility.
Admiral Sampson visited the
front to-day and had a long con
sultation with the military au
thorities. Careful observations
were taken from the hills with a
view to enabling the fleet to take
a position off Aguadores and
from there join in the bombard
ment of Santiago. His gunners
SAN FIIANCISCO, SATURDAY, JULY 9, 1898.
CALL OFFICE, RIGGS HOUSE, WASHINGTON, July 9, 1898.
I received to-ni^ht from a very high source the information that Santiago will
surrender. The adjutant general will not confirm the report, but I have good rea
son to believe it is true.
Am also informed by the same person that the administration expects peace
negotiations to be made almost immediately upon the receipt of the news that
Santiago has surrendered.

army in bringing the Spanish
general to terms of surrender.
LINARES COMMUNICATING
WITH HIS SUPERIORS

MAJOR GENERAL SHAFTER'S
HEADQUARTERS, BEFOR-E SANTI
AGO DE CUBA, July 7, by the Asso
ciated Press dispatch-boat Dauntless
(vis. Port Antonio and Kingston, Ja
maica), July 8. â The armistice has been
extended to noon Saturday in order to
allow Linares to communicate with
Blanco and with Madrid.
General Linares Informed General
Shafter that he had no telegraph ope
rator, and one was sent to the city, ac
companied by the British Consul, F. R.
Ramsden, under the British flag.
The armistice Is affording a long
needed rest for our men and they are
now in good shape to resume fighting.
The Spanish cruisers are still filled
with charred bodies and the buzzards
are devouring the remains. The Cu
bans, by Rear Admiral Sampson's or
ders, have buried the bodies of over
100 Spaniards who were washed ashore.
ELEVEN LIGHTERS LOST
DURING A STORM
WASHINGTON, July B.â The War
Department was advised to-night that
during a severe storm off the coast of
Cuba eleven lighters en route to San
tiago, In tow of tugs, were swamped
and lost. So far as known no lives were
lost. The lighters were froi.i Mobile,
New Orleans and Charleston and were
intended for the use of General Shaf
ter in transferring supplies and ord
nance from the transports to shore.
The department immediately put into
operation efforts to replace the lost
lighters.
OREGON MAY NOT TAKE
PART IN THE FIGHT
NEW YORK, July B.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Santiago,
according to the latest information,
will be bombarded first from the out
side harbor. The bombardment will be
opened most - robably by the battle
ships Massachusetts. Indiana and
Texas and the armored cruisers New-
York and Brooklyn. If, as is thought
now, the battle-ships Oregon and lowa
are to go to Guantanamo to coal pre
paratory to join the Eastern squadron
they may.not be present when the bom
bardment begins.
AMERICAN GUNBOAT
SCATTERS SPANIARDS
KEY WEST, July B.â On Wednesday,
while the Maple, of the blockading fleet,
was cruising off Cardenas, she sighted
about 4000 men, supposed to be Spanish
soldiers, on t he beach. The little gunboat
ventured about 50 shots from a distance of
about 4000 yards and scattered the sup-
Dosed Spaniards.
"PEACE!"
THE CRY
IN SPAIN
MADRID, July B.â The feature to-day
was the departure of the Duchess Isa
bel, mother of the Queen Regent. With
her eyes welling with tears she turned
to the generals assembled on the plat
form and confided her daughter to their
care. It was a touching sight.
The incomprehensible mercurial
Spanish temperament is again vividly
demonstrated. Yesterday every one
was talking wildly for war. To-day,
after a night's reflection, "peace" is the
word upon almost every lip. It is curi
ous in this respect to note that impres
sion made by the conduct of American
naval men toward Spanish prisoners
has produced a feeling highly appre
ciated here, that Americans have the
innate spirit of military chivalry which
up to now it has been denied they pos
sessed. In fact, as a Spaniard sitting
next to me Justly said:
"It shows they are a race of men who
have true military instincts."
LONDON, July B.â Dispatches from the
Continental capitals still talk of Euro
pean intervention in the Hispano-
American war. France Is being rep
resented as taking the initiative and
Germany and the other powers as de
clining to interfere.
A special dispatch from Madrid, re
viewing the situation, says: All Spain
knows of her defeat, and the people are
beginning to realize the magnitude of
the disaster. Extraordinary military
precautions have been taken to quell
any Internal troubles.
The peninsula armies will show a to
tal of 220,000 men by July 15. The rail
roads are preparing war trains on all
lines, and carriages are in readiness at
all the garrison stations.
A high authority, however, expresses
the opinion that the rank and file of
the soldiers are inclined to condemn
the war, and feel they are being driven
to bloodshed for an unjust cause by
scheming politicians, and he, therefore,
doubts the army's attitude in the event
of civil troubles.
The officers, too, while anxious for
war, are divided on the question of
loyalty to the various claimants to the
throne. This question of succession is
an important factor in a terribly tense
situation. It is believed the Govern
ment is anxious to find a pretext to
arrest General Weyler, fearing the part
he might play in the event of trouble
breaking out.
ST. PETERSBURG, July B.â The
Russian officials and the general public
here are strongly in favor of speedy
peace as the only salvation for Spain,
and the newspapers recommend the in
tervention of Europe to compel a ces
sation of hostilities.
Senor Gamazo and the Minister of
Foreign Affairs had a long conference
to-day on the subject of peace. To un
derstand the significance of this meet
ing it must be understood that one rep
resents the extreme war- element and
the other the peace party. Senor Sa
gasta arranged the conference to try
to find some middle course for the Gov
ernment. A member of the Cabinet to
day expressed the opinion that if the
United States would accept the inde
pendence of Cuba under an American
protectorate a solid basis for peace
could be reached.
MADRID, July B.â According to a
dispatch received from Havana Cap
tain General Blanco openly urges the
continuation of the war. The news
papers of this city say the moment has
not arrived to sue for peace, one of
them adding:
"We find ourselves in a position from
which we are able to make our enemies
feel the consequences of the war."
WASHINGTON, July B.â There was
| a continuation of peace talk to-day and
i other evidences in this line are coming
to the surface. Such, for instance, was
the confirmation by the State Depart
! ment of the report that the Cadiz fleet
was returning to Spain, since it is
scarcely conceivable that the Spanish
Government would doom this last rem
nant of its fleet to destruction at the
hands of Watson's squadron, which in
all probability could head it off before
it reached Cadiz, its home port. There
fore, the assumption is that the Span
ish Government calculates that at least
an armistice precedent to peace will be
obtained before the ships reach Spain.
ROME, July B.â The Italia says ne
gotiations have been opened among the
European powers with a view of ar
ranging peace. The best intentions,
the paper asserts, are manifested at
Washington, but the Madrid Cabinet
strongly opposes any idea of peace.
NEW YORK, July B.â The Journal's
London correspondent sends the fol
lowing: Spain has at length sought
peace, applying to Sir Henry Drum
mond Wolff, the Briti. a Embassador at
Madrid. The British Foreign Office has
presented the communication to colonel
John Hay, our Ambassador to England.
Official denials of this have been made
and they are technically correct, but it
is a fact that overtures have been
made.
The terms suggested as acceptable to
Spain are these:
Cuba to be independent, but to pay
to Spain an indemnity for several
years.
Spain to keep a minor Cuban port
until this indemnity shall have been
paid.
The great powers to send small de
tachments of troops to certain Cuban
ports.
The Philippine Islands to be In
dependent.
The United States to occupy Porto
Rico as security for the payment of a
war Indemnity, the amount of which
shall be negotiated.
These terms are regarded as merely
a minimum of what Spain exp2cts to
be asked of her.
Bennington Leaves Mare Island.
VALLEJO, July B.â The Bennlngton
left the navy-yard for San Francisco at
2:30 this afternoon.
C. C. CARLTON.
WATSON WILL
SAIL WITH A
LARGE FLEET
NEW YORK, July B.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: In
view of the return of Admiral Camara's
fleet to Spain the authorities are con
sidering the advisability of strengthen
ing the eastern squadron. As at present
organized the squadron consists of the
battleships lowa and Oregon; the pro
tected cruiser Newark (flagship) and
the auxiliary cruisers Yankee, Yose
mite and Dixie, besides a supply ship
and six colliers. This squadron will be
expected to meet and destroy the bat
tleship Pelayo, the armored cruiser
Carlos V, the ironclads Vltoria and
Numancia, three torpedo-boat destroy
ers, eleven torpedo boats and v number
of auxiliary cruisers.
While having faith in Commodore
Watson's ability to do this it is deemed
advisable to place at his disposal a
stronger force, at the same time retain
ing enough vessels on this side of the
Atlantic to defend the coast, maintain
the Cuban blockade and aid the army
In the invasion of Porto Rico.
There has been considerable doubt as
to whether the squadron would sail for
Spain if the Madrid Government or
dered Camara's fleet to return, but I
was assured after consideration was
given to the matter to-day that the
fleet would sail without fall.
"The orders to the fleet are no longer
in the nature of a bluff," a high official
told me. "Commodore Watson will go
to Spain and he will go as promptly as
possible."
The authorities have gone so far as
to select a rendezvous where Commo
dore Watson will collect his ships. This
point is in the \-cinity of Santiago,
where the battleships, two of the aux
iliary cruisers and his flagship are
lying. Should it be determined to in
crease his squadron it is not expected
that any additional armorclads will be
assigned to his command, as it is
thought desirable to keep a strong
force on this side of the water.
It is expected that by Thursday next
the fleet will be on its way across the
Atlantic, and in the meantime the au
thorities will determine what additional
ships should be placed under Commo
dore Watson's orders.
It can be stated on authority that it
will be Commodore Watson's duty to
find Camara's fleet and destroy it.
MADRID, July B.â La Correspond
encla de Espana says there is a feeling
of alarm due to the belief that the
United States warships Oregon. Texas
and New York are now on their way
to Spain, and precautions are being
taken at all the seaports to avoid a
surprise.
PARIS, July B.â A dispatch from Is
mailia sayÃ the Spanish squadron has
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
re-entered the canal on its way back
to Spain.
SUEZ, July B.â The Spanish squadron
is preparing to return to Spain.
SPANISH TROOPS AT
GUANTANAMO STARVING
Pitiful Story Told by an Emaciated
Soldier Picked Up by Men
From the Annapolis.
PLAYA DEL, ESTE, GUANTANAMO
BAY, CUBA, July 8, 6p. m.â A Spanish
soldier, terribly emaciated and so weak
that he could hardly walk, was picked
up by men from the United States gun
boat Annapolis to-day at a point near the
entrance to the upper bay. He had no
rifle, for he was too weak to carry it.
According to his story there are many
Spanish soldiers in Gauntanamo in the
same condition of starving. He says
there is absolutely nothing to eat there,
but that the Spaniards are daily told that
if they surrender to the Americans they
will be murdered.
Over 20,000 rations for reconcentrados
have been landed across the bay by Com
mander McCalla of the Marbiehead. and
the half-starved Cubans are flocking in
from the hills for food.
GENERAL MILLS GOES

General Nelson A. Miles and his
staff arrived in the city at 6:30 p. m.
and went out to the Yale. The expe
dition numbers in all 1720 men. There

Hobson's Surrender Was
Received by Cervera
in Person.
The Merrimac Hero Given an
Ovation on His Return to
the New York.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by the Associated Press.
< iFF SANTIAGO, July 8 (by the As
sociated Press Dispatch Boat Daunt
less, via Port Antonio and Kingston,
Jamaica, July S).â The return of As
sistant Naval Constructor Hobson to
his f=hip. the l.agship New York, last
night was ma' â â¢<! by wik enthusiasm.
Behind Hobson came Colonel John Ja
cob Astor and the first thing Hobson
tried to do was to introduce him to
the officers, but Colonel Astor got lost
In the crowd which purged around, in
sisting upon shaking Hobson's hand.
The transports blew their whistles.
When Hobson sat once more among
hip mesÃmates he told the story of his
c, his marvelous escape and
his Imprisonment in Morro Castle.
"I did not miss the entrance to the
harbor," he said, "as Ensign Powell,
cm the launch, supposed. I headed east
until 1 got my bearings and then made
for it, straight in. Then came the firing.
lv was grand, flashing out first from
one side of the harbor and then the
other from those b!g guns on the hills,
the Vizcaya, lying inside the harbor,
joining in.
"Troops from Santiago had rushed
down when the news of the Merrimac's
coining w;is telegraphed, and soldiers
lined the foot of the cliffs, firing wildly
; s and killing each other with their
j-flre. The Merrimac's steering
g< ar broke as she got to Estrella Point.
only three of the torpedoes on her
led when I touched the but
ton. A huge submarine mine caught
her full amidships, hurling water high
in the air and tearing a great rent in
the Merrimac's side.
"Her stern ran upon Estrella Point.
Chiefly owing to the work done by the
mine she began to sink slowly. At that
Bhe was across the channel, bui
a she settled the tide drifted her
around. We were all aft, lying on the
deck. Shells and bullets whistled
around us. The six-inch shells from
the Vizcaya came tearing into the
.Mtrriinac, crashing into wood and iron,
and passing clear through, while the
plunging shots from the forts broke
L'h her decks.
â¢' 'Not a man must move,' I said, and
it was only owing to the splendid dis
cipline of the men that all of us were
killed as the shells sailed over us
and minutes became hours of suspense.
The men's mouths grew parched, but
we must lit- there until daylight, 1 told
them. Now and again one or the other
c men lying with his face glued
tv the deck and wondering whether the
shell would not come our way
would say. ' Hadn't we better get off
now, sir? 1 But I said: 'Wait till day
light.'
"It would have been impossible to
get the catamaran anywhere but to the
Bhore where the soldiers stood shoot
ing and I hoped that by daylight we
might be recognized and saved. The
grand old Merrimac kept sinking. 1
wanted tv go forward and see the dam
ione there where nearly all the
fire was directed, but one man said that
if 1 arose it would draw the fire on the
rest. So I lay motionless. It was
splendid the way those men behaved.
The fire of the oldiers, the batteries
and the Vizcaya was awful.
"When the water came up on the
Merrimac's decks the catamaran float
ed amid the wreckage, but was still
made fast to the boom and we caught
hold of the edge and clung on, our
heads being above water. One man
thought we were safer right there; it
was quite light, the firing had ceased,
except that on the New York launch,
and I feared Ensign Powell and his
men had been killed. A Spanish launch
came toward t' Merrimac. Sve agreed
to capture her and run. Just as she
came close the Spaniards saw us and
a half dozen marines jumped up and
pointed their rifles at our heads.
" 'Is there any officer in that boat to
receive a surrender of prisoners of
war?' I shouted.
"An old man leaned over under the
awning and waved his hand. It was
Admiral Cervera. The marines low
ered their rifles and we were helped into
the launch.
"Then we were put into cells in Morro
Castle. Afterward we were taken into
Santiago. I had the court-martial room
in the barracks. My men were kept
prisoners in the hospital. From my
window I could see the army moving
across the open and being shot down
by the Spaniards in the rifle pitu in
front of me. The Spaniards became
as polite as could be. I knew something
was coming and then I was ex
changed."
Mr. Ramsden. the British Consul at
Santiago, was tireless in his efforts to
secure comfort for Hobson and his men.
Lieutenant Hobson could not under
stand his promised exceptional promo
tion, but was overjoyed to learn the
news that his bravery had been recog
nized by the people. He is the same
simple, unaffected, enthusiastic Hob
son, more anxious to talk about the ef
fect of exploding shells and army moves
than about his own brave deed. The
men who came with him received a
ringing reception. All are doing well.
HOBSON THE IDOL
OF HIS BRAVE CREW
Special cable to The Call and the Xew York
Herald. Copyrighted, 189S, by James Gor
don Bennett.
WITH ADMIRAL SAMPSON'S
Fi-EET, OFF S...JTIAGO. July 7 (via
Call-Herald Dispatch Boat Somers N.
Smith to Port Antonio, Jamaica, July
S). â Ever- one of the seven brave men
who went with Naval Constructor
Hobson on the Merrimac Is loud in his
praise of Hobson's course during the
now historic ( ploit. I had chats with
the members of - obson's crew to-day
and they added some interesting details
to the story as I sent it to The Call and
Herald from Hobson's own lips last
night.
"No braver or cooler man than Hob
son lives," said John Kelly. "If it had
not ~een for him, matters would have
gone much harder with us."
"Yes," said John P. Phillips, chiming
in, "he is a wonderful man. It is simply
a miracle that all of us escaped without
injury. When the Merrimac ran into
the harbor Hobson stood on the bridge
smiling as he looked through his
glasses and saw how well we were pro
gressing. He kept the collier headed
straight toward the channel, and never
faltered when bullets and shells came
falling about him. And, later on, when
we were taken on board the Reina Mer
cedes dressed only in the wet under
wear which we had cut off at the knees.
Hobson, as calm as ever, walked .up to
the commander of the Spanish vessel,
saluted him, and said:
" 'I demand whisky for mv men, who
have been long exposed in the water!"
"From the Reina Mercedes," Phillips
continued, "we were sent to Morro Cas
tle and kept in a vile place. Our guards
kept making signs intimating that they
would hang us."
"During the first bombardment of
the Morro," said Randolph Clausen,
another of the heroic Land, "the Span
ish guards begged the Merrimac men
to intercede for a cessation of ihe
American fire. When the Spanish
fleet was captured I saw Spanish offi
cers beat the guards and warn them
not to chow cowardice before the
"American pigs.' "
One of the Spanish guards told Clau-
Ben that the Spanish gunners had
killed fourteen and wounded thirty-five
of their own men in firing on the Merri
mac. He added that the hospitals were
filled with wounded and sick men who
had been filled with rum and rushed to
the front.
Hobson's men tell me they lived on
rice and sardines most of the time they
were held as prisoners.
Consul Ramsden, they said, brought
them extra food at times, including
meat, which cost 75 a pound.
Admiral Cervera called on Hobson
once and his men on several occasions
brought meat and other food to the
Merrimac'a crew. The Spanish garri
son in the cit. is Baid to live entirely
on rice and salt fish and there is much
sickness including several cases of yel
low fever. The Merrimac's men assert
that the city cannot long hold out, as
every available place is filled with
wounded soldiers. So hard pressed is
Linares, they â tdd. that the men who
are only slightly wounded are being
compelled to go to the front to resist
the American advance.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, July 8, 6 p. m.
âThe British cruiser Talbot, which left
Havana on Tuesday. .Tulv 5, arrived at
Port Royal to-day with twenty-three
passengers, among them Sir Alexan
der Gollan, British Consul-General at
Havana, and Mr. Higglns of the Brit
ish Consulate there, both on leave,
which is given as the only explanation
of their departure. Mr. Jerome has
been left in charge of British affairs
in Havana.
Mr. Higgins 1: "The city of Ha
vana is quiet and there are no new
complications. The well-to-do inhabit
ants ar subsisting tolerably. but the
poor are dying of starvation in the
streets. There are many sights of ter
rible miser v. The barracks are filled
with starving womsn.
"Th>- soldiers are fairly well fed. Gen
eral Pando has been sending troops
into the interior, it is said, en route to
Santiago, but I do not see how they
will get there.
"The blockade Is maintained and ves
sels are frequently tuned back. Every
body Is anxious for the conclusion of
the war, though the soldiers wish to
fight and all the officilas are resolute.
There is no flour in Havana, and no
meat, while yams are scarce."
Sir Alexander Gollan declined to say
anything on the condition of things ,it
Havana. The other passengers of the
Talbot are for the most part female
refugees.
CIVIL OFFICIALS OF
SANTIAGO SURRENDER
NEW YORK, July B.â A cablegram
to the Journal '-om Sibonev. Cuba,
dated July 7, says: The entire civil
government of the city has already
surrendered and come over to our lines
for protection, deserting the military
and denouncing the mad persistence in
resisting at the expense of the destruc
tion of Santiago.
Yesterday evening the civil Governor,
Benor Ros; the Mayor, Senor Porrase,
and the President of the upper court of
justice came to Caney and delivered
themselves up to our forces. They had
been forbidden by General Toral to
leave town, but fearing death in the
bombardment or at the hands of the
Spanish soldiers during the outbursts
attending defeat, they sneaked away,
coming across the mountains in a
crowd of other refugees, and as soon as
possible revealed their identity to the
Americans. Orders were issued to treat
them with every possible considera
tion for their comfort.
WRETCHED PLIGHT OF
THE WOUNDED MEN
Without Shelter From the Fierce Sun
Bays and the Intermittent
Showers.

don Bennett.
SHAFTER'S HEADQUARTERS BE
FORE SANTIAGO, July 6, by Call-
Herald dispatch boat Golden Rod to
Port Antonio, Jamaica, July 7. â Shock
ing conditions prevail in the general
hospital at these headquarters. There
is no shelter for scores of our soldiers,
but every member of General Shafter's
staff is provided with an individual
tent, in which he may be seen resting
in comfort by neglected sufferers.
The general army hospital here Is "In
a miserable condition. There are only
a few tents for the accommodation of
the wounded and the two large ones
now available for sufferers are filled
with Injured Cubans. Nearly all of
these men were hurt while engaged In
aimless wandeing about the field dur
ing the lighting on Friday and Satur
day. While the Cuban troops are thus
being well cared for our own troops
are crowded into smaller tents.
But even this is true only of the more
fortunate of the American sufferers.
Many lie entirely unsheltered from the
sun and the showers which fall daily
in this region. I am appalled at the
number of wounded soldiers who are
being subjected to a scorching sunbath
during part of the day and then to a
severe drenching during the other
hours.
I have made a careful investigation
Into the condition of our wounded
troops and to-day I found one man
lying unprotected in the sun with only
a pice of rubber pouch stretched on
the ground for a covering. He told me
with piteous fortitude that he had lain
in that condition for two days. Many
others I found were in an equally un
fortunate plight.
Our wounded are being taken to Sib
oney as fast as transportation can
be provided, but these facilities are en
tirely inadequate and many wounded
soldiers are compelled to lie for hours
without shelter. In . several instances
the sufferers have been subjected to
this treatment for days. Some regi
ments have received no rations for
three days. Thus while one regiment
is plentifully supplied with rations the
men in the adjoining regiment are suf
fering severely for want of food.

WEIRD TALE OF DANGER
TO TREASURE SHIPS
Unfounded Report That a Spanish
Privateer Was Off Van
couver Island.
VANCOUVER, B. C, July B.â The
story that a Spanish privateer is lurk
ing in Queen Charlotte Sound to cap
ture the treasure ships coming down
from St. Michael has proved to be a
very cheap fake. The report was re
ceived here first from Washington, D.
C, in a private telegram to a shipping
man. This morning the Associated
Press sent in a brief dispatch from
Washington covering the startling
news. This was followed almost im
mediately afterward by a dispatch
from Victoria, as follows:
"United States Consul Smith has no
tified the Department at Washington
that Pilot Westerley, who had been en
gaged on the steamer Alj>ha for the
north, has abandoned the engagement,
having received a contract to take a
tugboat to a T-rlvateer lying hidden in
Queen Charlotte Sound and act as pilot.
The nilot has been paid $2000 in cash,
the contract idee being $3000. Consul
Smith is very reticent."
The Call correspondent found Pilot
Westerlund (not westerley) at his resi
dence, 385 Hastings street, to-night,
and he says there is absolutely no truth
in the dispatch.
Olaf Westerlund has lived here since
1882 and is one of the oldest and most
reliable pilots on the northern ports of
the Pacific. He joined the steamer
Alpha on her arrival at Victoria and
has not left her since reaching here
yesterday morning. Westerlund can
not imagine how the story became cir
culated, and is naturally very much
concerned about it. When I found him
to-night and showed him the Victoria
dispatch he hotly declared he would not
turn Spaniard for twice that sum. He
added:
"I have a bone to pick with the
United States Government just the
same for having robbed me of a seal
ing schooner some years ago, but I
would not be guilty of picking it that
way."
He regards the story of the priva
teer being in the Northern Pacific as
altogether improbable. The Alpha
leaves here for St. Michael to-morrow
night and he will be aboard. It is said
the story was originated in the East by
people who were anxious to see the
gold come down in British vessels.

Humors of a Contemplated Step by

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July B.â The Even
ing Star has a copyrighted London ca
ble which says:
Developments ct high international
import may be expected in the Philip
pines within the next few weeks. In
formation reaches me to-day from a
high London dinlomatic quarter that
the unprecedented action of Germany
in marshaling her whole Eastern
squadron at Manila is the prelude to
decisive steps.
My informant, who cannot well be
misinformed, says that the decision has
already been arrived at in Berlin to
occupy one of the Phillipplne Islands as
a coaling station in the far East, which
the Kaiser said recently was vital to
Germany's position as a great power.
A further decision as to exactly which
Island shall be occupied and the ex
act day of the occupation awaits Prince
Henry's arrival at Manila, whither he
is now h "nd, but at most it will be
only a question of weeks.
My subsequent inquiries in other
well informed quarters indicate that
Germany's creation of a coaling station
at the Philippines is confidently ex
pected in German diplomatic quarters.
NEW YORK, July B.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
The latest report from London to the
effect that Germany is preparing to
seize one of the Philippines as a coaling
station is not credited here, as it is not
believed Germany is desirous of bring
ing about a rupture with the United
States. If such action should be taken
a rupture could hardly be avoided, as
occupation of any one of the Philip
pine Islands by a third power at this
time, with or without the consent of
Spain, could not but be regarded as an
act of hostility toward the United
States. Not only would Germany by
such action be in danger of bringing
about a war with the United States but
there would be grave danger of precipi
tating a general European war.
HONGKONG, July 8.--A dispatch
from Manila under date of July 4 says
that Admiral Dewey will remain in
active until General Merritt arrives.
The rebels are practically doing noth
ing, but the Spaniards are strengthen
ing their position, destroying huts and
woods and constructing intreneh
ments. The authorities have enacted a
penalty of $1000 against anybody who
shall raise the prices of provisions'. The
Spaniards assert that, despite the loss
of the water works, there will be no
water famine during the rainy season.
CAVITE, P. 1., July 4 (via Hong
kong, July 8). â Floods in the country
districts are hindering the advance of
the American troops. Rear Admiral
Dewey has given notice that he will not
allow any more refugees to be removed
from Manila on board ship. The Ger
man cruiser Cormorant left here to-day
for Iloio, where the British gunboats
Pigay and Rattler are in the harbor.
CHICAGO, July B.â A special cable to
the Chicago Record from its corre
spondent, John T. McCutcheojn, who is
with Admiral Dewey's fleet at Manila
Bay, dated July 4 (via Hongkong),
says :
The American troops under General
Andersen, which have reached the Phil
ippines, are now comfortably quartered
in the Spanish military barracks at Ca
vite, and are busy preparing for active
service against the Spanish. Their
health continues good.
The insurgents control the city water
works and -have cut off the supply from
that source, but as this is the rainy sea
son and there is a cloudburst every day,
the Spaniards do not suffer from lack
of water. A more serious matter for
them at present is that the insurgents
have captured San Juan del Monte, a
few miles to the rear of the city, which
had been fitted up with old cannon and
a supply of ammunition and provisions
to serve as the last stronghold of the
Spanish Government after the forces
should be driven out of Manila by the
bombardment of the American war-
ships.
ROME, July B.â The Pololo Romano
says the Italian Government has or
dered the third-class cruisers Piemento
and Degali to proceed to the Philip
pine Islands.
TOOK HIM FOR A LUNATIC.
Mr. Quiller-Couch, in one of his
delightful letters "From a Cornish
Window," in the Pall Mall Magazine,
prefaces his remarks with this anec
dote: "Hicks, governor of the Cornwall
County Lunatic Asylum, had a great
many friends â extramural friends, I
mean, and among them an accom
plished landscape painter. This artist
captivated by the beauty of the little
seaport town of East Looe took lodg
ings there, chose his subject and start
ed to make some drawings of it on the
rocks at low tide. A few days later
Hicks drove over to see him. and ar
rived at West Looe to be taken across
the harbor in a boat. To his surprise
he found a boatman waiting for him.
Still more to his surprise the boatman
hailed him thus: 'Aw, Mr. Hicks, I've
a-been looking out for 'cc the last day
or two. I knowed you'd come. He's
over here now. He's been hollering and
screeching. He sits at low water down
among the weed, a-paintlng at a bit of
board, and he calls out, "Come into the
Garden, Maud." A pretty garden he've
a-got there! "I'm here by the gate,
alone." Not a gate within a mile of 'un!
You can take 'un; he's quiet.' "

Details of the Destruction of the
Cruiser by Three f?n)erican
Warships.
NEW YORK, July B.â A Key West special to the Herald sayst A
gunboat which arrived from Havana this morning, where she had been
doing blockading services, brings the details of the destruction by seve
ral American vessels of a large Spanish steamer, supposed to be the
Alfonso XIII.
The story as told to me by the officers â and they obtained it from
the flagship before sailing yesterday afternoon â is to the effect that on
Wednesday night, while the Hawk was patrolling off the north coast
of Pinar del Rio, a large Spanish steamer was observed hugging the
shore and making rapid movements in the direction of Havana. The
Hawk fired a shot across the stranger's bow and endeavored to head her
off. At the same time she signaled the other vessels for assistance.
The steamer paid no attention to the shots from the Hawk, but in
creased her speed.
The signals from the Hawk were seen by the Castine and Prairie,
which were also patrolling in that vicinity. These vessels hastened
to assist the Hawk. Meanwhile the Spaniard, which was a vessel of
more than 5000 tons with two funnels and four masts, was rapidly dis
tancing her little pursuer, when the Castine and Prairie hove into sight
ahead and opened fire with their superior batteries.
The Spaniard, seeing her further advance cut off and without any
chance of escaping, never for a moment wavered, but put her wheel
hard to the starboard and headed for the shore, where she was beached
within sight of Mariel. The three American vessels stood by and kept
up an incessant firing at close range, the Castine doing the most ef
fective work, every shot telling with destructive effect.
Three distinct explosions took place aboard the Spaniard, evidently
from her magazine, throwing mountains of debris high into the air and
leaving the vessel a complete wreck on the beach. The crew is be
lieved to have been nearly all killed, the few who escaped the hail of
shot and shell aboard by jumping into the sea being drowned while
attempting to reach the shore.

BEFORE SANTIAGO, July 7, per Asso

July B.â lt was Sergeant McKinnery of
Company B, Ninth Infantry, who shot and
disabled General Linares, the commander
of the Spanish forces in Santiago. The
Spanish general was hit about half an
hour after San Juan hill was taken, dur
ing the first day's fighting. Our men
saw a Spanish officer, evidently a gen
eral, accompanied by his staff, riding
frantically about Spanish position
rallying his men. Sergreant McKinnery
asked Lieutenant Wise's permission to
try a shot at the officer #Lcd greeny re
gretted that the request was refused. Ma
jor Bole was consulted. He acquiesced,
with the injunction that no one else
should fire.
Sergeant McKinnery went for a shell,
slid it into a rifle, adjusted the sights for
1000 yards and fired. It fell short. Then
he put in another, raised the sights for
another thousand yards, took careful aim
and let her go.
The officer on the white horse threw up
his arms and fell forward.
"That is for Corporal Joyce," said Mc-
Kinnery, as he saw that his ball had
reached the mark.
The officer on the white horse was Gen
eral Linares himself. He immediately re
linquished the command to General Toral.

EVANS' STORY
OF THE FRAY
Captain of the lowa De
scribes the Santiago
Battle.
Tried to Ram the Enemy's Ships
With His Own, but They
Were Too Fleet.
Copyrighted. IR9B, by
OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, per the I
Associated Press dispatch boat Daunt
less, via Port Antonio, Jamaica., and
Kingston, Jamaica, July B.â The battle
ship lowa was the first ship to see the
Spanish fleet coming out of the harbor.
A moment later h.r crew was at gen
eral quarters and at 33 a. m. a gun
wu tir><l -o attract the attention of
the fleet. Captain Evans' account of
the battle, as told In the cabin of the |
lowa to a co? of the Asso- !
elated Press, is intensely interesting.
He said:
"At the time 'general quarters' was
sounded the signal boll rang 'full speed
ahead,' and I put the helm to star
board and the [ova crossed the bow
of the Infanta Maria Teresa, one of the
first ships out. As the Spanish admiral
swung to the westward the 12-inch
shells from the forward turret of the
lowa seemed to strike her fairly in the
bow. and the fight was a spectacle. As
the squadron came out in column, the
ships beautifully spaced as to distance
and gradually increasing their speed to
thirteen knots, it was superb.
"The lowa from this moment kept up
a steady fire from her heavy guns,
heading all the time to keep the In
fanta Maria Teresa on her starboard
bow and hoping to ram one of the lead
ing ships.
"In the meantime the Oregon. Indi
ana. Brooklyn and Texas were doing
excellent work with their heavy guns.
"In a very Bhort space of time the
enemy's ships were all clear of the har
bor mouth and it became evidently Im
possible f<>r the lowa to ram either the
first or the second ship on account of
the speed.
"The range at this time was 2000 j
yards from the leading ship. The !
lowa's helm was immediately put hard
to starboard and the entire starboard j
broadside was pouring into the Infanta '
Maria Teresa. The helm was then I
quickly shifted to port and the ship '
wr-nt across the stern of the Teresa in j
an effort to head off the Oquendo. All
the time the engines were driving at
full speed ahead. A perfect torrent of
shells from the enemy passed over the
smokestack and superstructure of the
ship, but none struck her."
"The Cristobal Colon, being much
faster than " rest of the Spanish
ships, passed r-, idly to the front in an
effort to escape. In passing the lowa
the Colon placed two 6-inch shells fair
1'- in our starboard bow. One passed
through the â  rdam and dispensary,
wrecking the latter and bursting on
the berth deck, doing considerable
damage. The other passed through
tho side at t" water line within the
cofferdam, where it still remains.
"As it was now obviously impossible
to ram any of the Spanish ships on ac
count of their superior speed the lowa's
helm was put to the Btarboard and she
ran on a course parallel with the en
emy. Being then abreast of the Almi
rante Oquecdo, at a distance of 1100
yards, the lowa's entire battery, in
cluding the rapid-fire guns, was opened j
on the Oquendo. The punishment was j
terrific. Two 12-inch shells from the
lowa pierced the Almirante Oquendo
at the same moment, one forward and
the other aft. The Oquendo seemed to
Btop her engines for a moment and lose
headway, but she immediately resumed
her sp^ed and gradually forged ahead j
of the lowa and came under the terri- I
i â â  fire of the Oregon and Texas.
"At this moment the alarm of "tor
;â¢(!â )-boats' was sounded, and two tor
pedo-boat destroyers were discovered
on the starboard quarter at a distance I
of 4000 yards. Fire was at once opened I
on them with the after battery and a
12-inch shell cut the stern of one de
stroyer squarely off. As the shell
struck a small torpedo-boat fired back I
at the battle-ship, sending a shell with
in a fow feet of my head.
"Well up among the advancing cruis
ers, spitting shots at one and the other,
was the little Gk.-ucester, shooting first j
at a cruiser and ihen at a torpedo boat, i
and hitting a head wherever she saw it. j
The marvel Is that she was not de- I
stroyed by the rain of shells.
"In the meantime the Vizcaya was |
slowly drawing abeam of the lowa and I
for the space >->f fifteen minutes it was
jriv<-> and take between the two ships.
The Vizcaya fired rapidly, but wildly,
not one shot taking effect on the lowa, !
while the shells from the lowa were I
tearing great rents in the sides of the
VizeajnÃL As the latter passed ahead
of the lowa she came under the mur
derottfl lire of the Oregon.
"At this time the Ir.rr.nta Maria Te
resa and the Almirante Oquendo, lead
ing the enemy's volumn, were seen to
be h-ading for the beach and in flame?.
The Texas, Oregon and lowa poundc-d
them unmercifully. They ceased to re
ply to the fire and in a few moments
the Spanish cruisers were ;i mass of
fames and on the rocks with their col
ors down, the Teresa Hying a white
flag.
"The enemy's crews stripped them-
Belves and began jumping overboard,
and one of the smaller magazines be
gun to explode.
"Meantime tho Brooklyn and Cristo
bal Colon were exchanging compli
ments In lively fashion at apparently
Jong range, and the Oregon, with nor
locomotive speed, was hanging well on
to the Colon, also paying attention to
the Vizcaya. The Teresa and the

just 20 minutes after the first shot was
fired.
"Fifty minutes after the first shot
was fired the Vizeaya put her helm to
port with a great burst of flame from
the after part of the ship and headed
slowly for the rocks at Aserradero,
where she found her last resting place.
"As it was apparent that I could not
possibly catch the Cristobal Colon, and
that the Oregon and Brooklyn undoubt
edly would, and as the fast New York
was also on her trail, I decided the
calls of humanity should be heard and
attention be given to the 1200 or 1500
Spanish officers and men who had
struck their colors to the American
squadron, commanded by Admiral
Sampson. I therefore headed for the
wreck of the Vizcaya, now burning
furiously fore and aft. When I was in
as far as the depth of water would ad
mit I lowered all my boats and sent
them at once to the assistance of the
men who wore being drowned by doz
ens or roasted on the deck&. I soon dis
covered that the Insurgent Cubans from
the shore were shooting on men who
were struggling in the water, after hav
ing surrendered to us. I immediately
put a stop to this, but could not put
a stop to the mutilation of many bodies
by the sharks inside the reef.
"These creatures had become excited
by the blood from the wounded mixing
In the water. My boats' crews worked
manfully and succeeded in saving
many of the wounded from the burning
ship. One man who will be recommend
ed for promotion clambered up the side
of the Vizcaya and saved three men
from burning to death.
"The smaller magazines of the Viz
caya were exploding with magnificent
cloud effects. The boats were coming
alongside in a steady string, and will
ing hands were helping the lacerated
Spanish officers and sailors on the
lowa's quarterdeck.
"All the Spaniards werÂ° absolutely
without clothe . Some had their legs
torn off by fragments of shells. Others
were mutilated in every conceivable
way.
"The bottoms of the boats held two or
three inches of blood. In many cases
dead men were lying in the blood. Five
poor chaps died on the way to the ship.
They were afterward buried with mili
tary honors from the lowa. Some ex
amples of heroism, or more properly,
devotion to discipline and duty, could
never be surpassed. One man on the
lost Vizcaya had his left arm almost
shot off just below the shoulders.
"The fragments were hanging by a
small piece of skin. But he climbed un
assisted over the side and saluted as if
on a visit of ceremony. Immediately
after him c:me a strong-hearted sailor,
whose left leg had been shot off above
the knee. He was hoisted on board the
lowa with a tackle, but never a whim
per came from" him.
"Gradually the mangled bodies and
naked well men accumulated until it
would have been almost difficult to rec
ognize the lowa as a United Slates bat
tle-ship. Blood was all over her usu
ally white quarterdeck, and 272 naked
men were being supplied with water
and food. Finally came the boats with
Captain Eulate, commander of the Viz
caya, for whom a chair was lowered
over the side, as he was evidently
wounded.
"The captain's guard of marines were
drawn up on the quarterdeck to salute
him, and I stood waiting to welcome
him. As the chair was placed on the
deck, the marines presented arms. Cap
tain Eulate slowly raistd himself from
the chair, saluted me with grave dig
nity, unbuckled his sword belt and
holding the hilt of the sword before
him, kissrd it reverently with tears
in his eyes and then surrendered it to
me.
"Of course, I declined to receive his
sword; and, as the crev,- of the lowa
saw this they cheered like wild men.
"As I knew the crews of the first two
ships wrecked had not been visited by
any of our vessels I ran down to them.
I four.d the Gloucester with Admiral
Cervera and a nu- o* his officers
aboard and also a large number of
wounded, some in a frightfully mangled
condition. Many prisoners had been
killed on shore by the fire of the Cu
bans.
"The Harvard came off and I re
quested Captain Cotton to go in and
take off the crews of the Infanta Maria
Teresa and the Almirante Oquendo,
and by midnight the Harvard had 974
prisoners aboard, a great number of
them wounded.
"For courage and dash there Is no
parallel in history to this action of the
Spanish admiral. He came, as he
knew, to absolute destruction. There
was one single hope â that was that the
Cristobal Colon would steam faster
than the Brooklyn. The .< ctacle of
two torpedo-boat destroyers â paper
shells at bestâ steaming out in broad
daylight in the face of the fire of a
battleship can be described in one way:
It was Spanish and it was ordered by
Blanco. The same must be said of the
entire movement.
"I took Admiral Cervera aboard from
the Gloucester, which had rescued him
from the dead, and received him with
a full admiral's guard. The crew of
the lowa crowded close to the turrets,
half naked and black with powder, as
Cervera stepped over the side, bare
headed. Over his undershirt he wore
a thin suit of flannel borrowed from

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, July B.â The Plant line
steamer Halifax has arrived here, hav
ing on board 162 survivors of the
French line steamer La Bourgogne,
which was sunk in a collision with the
ship Cromartyshire, off Sable Island,
last Monday. On the passage from
Halifax La Bourgogne's passenger list
was carefully revised and it was shown
that there were 714 persons on board,
of whom 550 were lost and 164 saved.
Of the saved 12 were second class pas
sengers, 47 steerage and the remaining
105 were members of the crew.
,On arriving here the shipwrecked
men were given every necessary atten
tion. Each was provided with a ticket
for New York.
Among the remarkable escapes were
those of three stokers of La Bourgogne
â Louis le Julien, Jean Alvany and
Francoise Mello. They were in the
stokehole when the accident occurred.
Their story in substance is as follows:
"The engines were stopped after the
j collision and subsequently we started
them again in the hope of beaching the
steamer on Sahle Island. About five
minutes after the crash the water be
| gan to come into the boiler room, and
j soon it rushed in in great volume. The
pumps were tried, but to no avail. The
water put the fires out and the engines
stopped. The chief engineer gave or
ders to close the water-tight doors, but
even after they were closed the water
came in almost as fast as before. Then
all hope was abandoned, and the engi
neer blew twice on the whistle, the sig
nal for all to escape who could do so.
There was a rush, but about fifteen
men were drowned in the stokeholes
and the engine room."
The three men who succeeded in get
ting out found that all the boats had
left and they plunged into the sea. They
were picked up later and taken on
board the Cromartyshire.
From the testimony of three persons
âOtto Zeiser of New York, William
Achard of Baltimore and Charles Lie
bra, chief cock of the Stafford Hotel,
Philadelphiaâ it appears that the fourth
engineer of La Bourgogne, who was
saved, acted in the most brutal man
ner toward the passengers. The three
men agree in the statement that after
the collision, when everybody was sur
rounding the boats, the engineer said:
"Damn the passengers. Let them
save themselves; we save ourselves
first."
He said that if he had a revolver he
would shoot the passengers.
Mr. Zeispr Bpcke in great praise of
the captain.
On the voyage Llebra became ac
quainted with Yousouf, the wrestler,
who was a passenger. After the col
lision, Liebra says, he saw Yousouf
struggling in a crowd of drowning pas
sengers, beating them off with a sti
letto and shoving them aside and try
ing to reach a boat. He failed, how
ever, and went down.
L. Tarlaud ut New York and M. Lu
cas, from Northern France, the latter
being a waiter on board L.a Bourgogne,
each tells at his being driven from a
boat containing Austrians, armed with
knives.
While the Halifax was entering Bos
ton harbor this morning- eight persons
gave their names as witnesses to the
fact that the Austrians used knives to
keep people out of their boat.
NEW YORK, July B.â The survivors
of the steamship La Bourgogne arrived
here to-day from Boston and were
taken in charge by the Compagnie
Transatlantique officials. The surviv
ors of the crew of La Baurgogne, as
they passed the station, were hissed by
the crowd.
The Times prints the following:
"The alleged brutality toward the
passengers of La Bourgogne during the
struggle of life following the collision
and sinking of the vessel is the subject
of much comment throughout the city.
It is the popular opinion that the stor
ies of the surviving passengers must
lead to an investigation of unusual
thoroughness and interest."
Assistant District Attorney Unger, in
discussing the case, said that in com
mon law any company was responsi
ble for the acts of its employes. In his
opinion the surviving sailors of La
Bourgogne could be indie-ted for mur
der if the charges could be proved. It
was the first duty of the sailors, he
said, to save the passengers.
Francis Edmond Bruwaert, the
French Consul General, said that as
soon as the survivors of the wreck
reach this port a consular investiga
tion would be instituted to collect all
available evidence concerning the cas
ualty, and this would be forwarded to
the French Maritime Court.
When asked whether, if there was
evidence given by the passengers to
show that any parties or members of
La Bourgogne's crew had actually
killed a passenger from one of the
ship's boats, he would be arrested here,
the Consul said that he had not had
time to look up the law on the subject.
"I am inclined to think, however," he
said, "that I would simply forward the
evidence to the home authorities, and
if it were decided that crime had been
committed I would be instructed to
cause the arrest of the guilty parties if
they were still here, or they would be
arrested in France, where they will all
be sent."
CATS IN THE FORUM.
The Forum of Augustus is the cats'
home of Rome. There the superfluous
felines , are dropped over the ' wall to
join their numerous fellows in the
Forum below. Every day charitable
people throw scraps jof food into this
open prison, and, as seen from above,
its inhabitants seem to be plump and
happyâ so happy, indeed, that they
make no attempt to â¢â  escape. A few
years ago the Forum of Trajan was
also used as a depositing place for cats
that were rot wanted, but as it does
not present the same facilities of re
treat and hiding, as the Forum of Au
gustus street boys ' ; and others took
every opportunity of stoning the unfor
tunate animals. -Finally the authori
ties, after many complaints, refused to
allow any more cats to be thrown there,
and; in order, to get rid of those al
ready- living; in the Forum, presented
one to each sentry-box on .the walls of
the city. ; They |. all, however, speedily
disappeared from their new-homes,
some returning to the foot of Trajan's
Column, where they were either; killed
by the street boys or transferred to the
Forum of â Scientific Amer
ican.

ANTIQUITY OF HEMP.
Hemp Is of antique origin, for it was
used by the Scythians at least 500 years
before the Christian era. It grows wild
in India and many parts of our own
land and it was known to the Chinese
thousands of years ago. The Romans
were familiar with the use of hemp for
sails and cordage. India and Persia is
the native home of hemp, and it is cul
tivated In the United States in Ken
tucky, Illinois, Nebraska and Missouri.
Recently California has become inter
ested in its growth, and in this State it
often reaches a height of fifteen or
twenty feet.
Raw hemp, produced in Japan, is sold
in ribbons thin as paper and glossy as
satin, the frayed ends showing fibers of
exceeding thinness. We import $500,000
worth of hemp yearly from Italy and
Russia. A grower in California says it
costs $20 an acre to produce hemp, 2000
pounds to the acre, and he clears $60 an
acre.
Our best hemp comes from Italy, and
we pay 8 cents a pound for it. The Ital
ians take great pains, plowing twice at
intervals of fifteen days. After cutting,
the stalks are removed to a shady place
and the tops inclined over a trestle to
dry. In favorable soils from 1700 to 2000
pounds an acre are produced.
HE NEEDED PUNISHMENT.
It was evident â when the man rapped
at the door of the backwoods cabin that
he felt that he had a grievance.
"Somethin' wrong', stranger?" inquir
ed the man who came in answer to his
knock, noticing: his excited condition.
"Wrong!" exclaimed the stranger.
"Wrong! Well. I should think there
was. I met a boy about half a mile up
the road that I think belongs to you."
"Long, gawky boy with a coonskin
cap?" asked the man in the cabin.
"That's the one," returned the
stranger.
"He had a gun and was evidently out
after squirrels."
"Big, old-fashioned, muzzle-loading
gun?" suggested the native.
"Yes; a big gun about half a foot
longer than he is," answered the
stranger. "I didn't stop to see whether
it was a muzzle-loader or not, but I
guess it was. It didn't look new
enough for anything else."
"That was Ike all right enough," said
the native. "What d'ye want of him?"
"I want him thrashed," replied the
stranger with emphasis. "I want him
thrashed good and hard so that he'd
have a little sense."
"That's takln' a purty big contract,
stranger," said the native doubtfully.

Trustee Sylva, claiming that the latter
told the Western Union Telegraph
Company that the new firm showed no
desire to act fairly and get . license.
"I have been assured by the com

for using his revolver too freely, be
cause he was begging everybody that
knew of the fracas to keep quiet to
day, and even went so far as to deny
that lie had attempted to shoot Hughes
and Alexander yesterday morning,
though he admitted it freely yesterday.
It Is pretty freely prophesied that Creed
will get killed if he does not change
his tactics In the near future.
AN UNFORTUNATE PRINCESS.
We are very far from having heard
the last of the scandal in connection
with Prince Philip of Coburg and his
wife. Princess Louise of Belgium,
daughter of King Leopold. In the first
place the criminal authorities of Aus
tria have declined to hold Captain Keg
levitch on the charge brought against
him by Prince Philip of being concerned
in the forgery of promissory notes bear-
Ing the name of Princess Louise and
of her sister, Crown Princess Stephanie.
Instead, however, of being released,
the unfortunate young officer has been
transferred to- the military hospital at
Agram as a lunatic by orders received
direct from the Minister of War at
Vienna.
The latter, Baron Bauer by name, Is
the most intimate friend of Prince
Philip and acted as his second in the
duel which the prince fought with the
captain some months ago at Vienna,
There is. therefore, a very strong sus
picion that the prince has used his in
fluence with tho Minister of War to get
the captain placed under restraint as a
lunatic, although he is perfectly sane.

asserted on excellent authority, direct
from the engineering department of the
Santa Pc, that a survey has been com
pleted to the Bakersfielcl line which will
make a detour and avoid all the ex
tensive grades the Southern Pacific line
takes. The mileage of the now line
from a point on the old Atlantic and
Pacific line to Bakersfleld will be
greater than that of the Southern Pa
cific, but it will not be as difficult to
carry a train over. Better time will be
made as the grades, comparatively
speaking, will be light when the line
of the Southern Paciilc in surmounting
the- Tehachapi Mountains is considered.
It is now asserted by some of the
Sania Fe Company's officials here that
as soon as the Santa Fe has obtained
possession of the Atlantic and Pacific
road from the Needles to Mojave an
extension north to meet the Valley
Road may be expected. The breaking
out of the Spanish-American war has
delayed the initiatory steps somewhat,
but they all regard the extension as
certain to be made.

the cause of Princess Louise with such
vehemence that it would probably fare
ill with Prince Philip were he to show
his face at present in Belgium.
Letters by the score, and even affi
davits, are being published by people
of every class, some of them signed by
the grandest names of the Belgian no

and in correspondence with the prin
cess, and that she is perfectly sane and
in her right mind, and that the charges
of forgrery brought against her and
against the captain, as well as the In
terment of both one and the other as
lunatics, is solely for the purpose of in
validating the very serious charges
brought by the princess against the
prince, and on the strength of which
she had initiated divorce proceedings
at Vienna and at Pesth before ever the
prince had instituted a suit for the dis
solution of his marriage at Coburg. â

FOREIGN BAGGAGE LABELS.
The Philadelphia Ledger says that for
eign baggage labels are in great demand
just now. And a student of the Univer
sity has cornered the market in these la
bels, selling them to people who want to
show some evidence of having been
abroad. "This year," says the Record,
"the demand seems to be greater than

The prolit in this queer business must be
exceedingly large, as this particular

resources for his livelihood and school

trips and live in luxury during his sum

his principal customers, but lots of other
young men and girls are also often seen
emerging from the label merchant's

AN INDIAN PRINCESS DEAD.
Mrs. Zerriah Gould Mitchell, an In
dian princess, died in her daughter's
home at North Abington, Mass., re
cently, at the age of 91. She had lived
on the shore of Lake Assawamset,
about forty miles from Boston, for
many years. She and her children
were the only living descendants of the
Indian chieftain Massasoit, whose tribe
at one time numbered 30,000. Massasoit
always remained friendly to the colon
ists in the face of many wrongs re
ceived at their hands. Zerriah Mitchell
was descended from Massasoit through
his daughter Annie, who married Tus
paguin, known in Indian history as the
Black Sachem. She was educated, and
before her marriage, in 1824, taught in
a private school in Boston. Of her
twelve children but four are living. One
of her daughters, Melinda, whose In
dian name is Teweelema, is a familiar
figure in Boston, where she goes to sell
the fancy baskets made by herself and
her sister. They live in their mother's
old house and cultivate several acres of
land.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July B.â Peter Maher
defeated Joe Goddard to-night in eight
rounds at the Lenox Athletic Club. The
fight had been scheduled for twenty
five rounds, with five-ounce gloves.
Goddard had defeated Maher on two
previous occasions, and was the favor
ite among the sporting element previ
ous to the fight.
Goddard administered a lot of hard
punishment to his adversary, but re
ceived a terrific pounding while he was
doing so. He was out a couple of times,
but the bell saved him, and when he
quit toward the end of the eighth
round he was scarcely able to stand on
his feet. At the same time the fast
work which both had gone through
from the beginning had told on Maher,
and he was unable to land a blow
heavy enough to finish the Australian.
In the first round, in a lively ex
change, Maher hooked his right to the
head and put Joe to the floor. God
dard's nose was bleeding when the
gong sounded.
In the second Goddard's defense was
bad, and Maher got at him frequently,
but did no great damage. After some
rough infighting in the third, Goddard
went down again from a left swing on
the face. When he got up Maher sent
him down again. At the close of the
fourth Goddard got in a couple of lefts
on the head that staggered Maher.
Round five saw Goddard lying on the
floor, and he stayed down nine seconds.
Maher repeated the performance when
Joe got on his feet, and the latter again
took nine seconds' rest before rising.
The next two rounds were full of hard
hitting on both sides, but in the eighth
Maher brought his man to his knees.
The final round started lively, God
dard trying hard to reach Maher ef
fectively, but Peter landed repeatedly
on head and face. Goddard was now
unable to defend himself and held his
head down with the arms crossed in
front of his face. Maher went at him,
but could not land a knockout blow.
Goddard backed away and stretched
out his hands, saying as he did so:
"This is more than nature can
stand."
The referee then awarded the flght to
Maher. Time of round 2 minutes 55
seconds.

Is the lot of the man who is a. weak and
puny mortal. Watch for the drawn face
and the tired limbs. See those trembling
hands. Notice the uncertain look in the eye.
What brings men to this pass The thing
principally to blame is indiscretion. If you
eat too much rich food you will sooner or
later have dyspepsia. If you drink too
freely other troubles quite as serious will
face you. If you go to excess of any nature
you must pay the penalty. You stunt nature
and you become a weakling â a half-man.
Nature resents abuse of all faculties. There
is, however, relief for you if you are "down"
and "all gone" to-day. You have only to
ask for relief and you get it.
Write. That is as good. "Hudyan," which
is nature's own production, brings instanta-
neous help. It stops the drains which are
sapping your very life's fountain of vitality
in a week. Then the system responds in a
grand way. Life is again a pleasure.
Spirits rise and full strength and fire re-
appear. "Hudyan" does this for the weak
at all times and in all places. It has never
been known to failâ indeed, it cannot fail.
Circulars and testimonials are sent freely to
all inquirers. These show its wondrous
power in a manner that cannot be doubted.
A great army of men have been restored to
the full enjoyment of youthful energy by it.

I THOS. COOK & SON. Agents, 621 Market
of Bouldin Island, who runs a ferry from
Central Station to Andrews Island, dis
charged two loads from a double-bar
reled shotgun, this morning, into Steve
Gordon, agent for the California Naviga
tion and Improvement Company. The
shooting took place about 9 o'clock on
the Sacramento side of the river, and the
wounded man was brought to Stockton
this afternoon on the Clara Crow. After
the shooting of Gordon, Swanson went in
to his ark, when another shot was heard.
As Swanson has not been seen since it
is believed he has committed suicide.
The shooting was the result of a quarrel,
In which Swanson was the aggressor.
Gordon is not dangerously wounded.
It has since been learned that after
firing the two shots Swanson returned to
his ark and. locking the door, blew the
top of his head off. The quarrel was over
the fact that Gordon had carried a man
across the river in a skiff after Swanson
had refused to answer a signal to come
after him. Swanson had been drunk for
two or three days and \*as ugly.

Yesterday the Woodland men believed
their action was Indorsed by all their
townspeople. If so, many had altered
their opinion, for when the company
reached home to-night their reception
was not what the 3' had counted on. To
be sure, there was an immense crowd at
the depot, but they were mostly friends
and relatives of the men. with ;i sprink
ling of the curious. There were also a
and fifteen or twenty citizens, who
escorted Captain Ward and his men to
the Armory. There was no unusual
demonstration, and when the armory was
rÂ«ached Captain Ward briefly expl
the position of himself and his m-n and
then dismissed his company. That was
all. Many conservatism resident Â« of
Woodland, while blaming Governor Budd
for his action, feel that the men went
forth to serve their country, not Captain
Ward, and they do not consider that the
soldiers were Justified in their course.
Governor Budd has been charged In
many quarters with having allowed pol
itics to enter into the naming of officers
of the Eighth Regiment. This accusation
is not borne out by facts, of the line of

In a signed statement to The Call yes
terday Captain Ward said in effect that
there could be no good reason why he
was removed. A letter signed by the
adjutant general to a citizen of Wood

in The ("all, asserting that Captain Ward

in an evening paper, that his bond had
been pigeonholed at Sacramento for some

George B. Baldwin, who will command
the company, went to San Jose to assist
in forming it, and Major Whitton went
down on the afternoon train to lend his
aid. Reports from there indicate that
the greatest enthusiasm prevails, and
that Captain Baldwin will come into

lowing reasons: â  -,'-. â â '-* -â¢,;â¢â â â  : . , -; '
First â The regimental commanders " are too
lenient and 'careless', In ;. the hours given their

all men should 'be: In quarters unless given :
passes for â  important reasons. ,
Secondâ Regimental- surgeons are not requir
ing company cooks to : exercise proper care . of
kitchen slops and ; garbage: , It is . suggested
that they be required to burn all kitchen gar
bage possible, and : that, the filth and garbage*
collected by the morning policing parties be
also promptly burned.' -.-.-- ; ; â¢ . . â¢. â :'- â .-â .'

MOSBY AND WHITE.
Correspondence on the Topic
of Political Influence for
War Commissions.
It seems likely that Colonel John S.
Mosby's desire to serve his country will
not be gratified Wiles political influence is
Invoked in his behalf. At the llrst sign
of conflict with Spain, Colonel Mosby,
whose military record is too well known
a story to require new telling, wired to
his friend General Miles, who had desired
his services that he was ready to serve.
Much to his surprise, the gallant Mosby
received from Miles a brief response sug
gesting that he use "influence"; suggest
ing further that Colonel Mosby enlist in
his cause the Congressional representa
tives of his State.
This tho Colonel positively declined to
do and allowed matters to remain as they
were until two weeks ago when he receiv
ed word that Rev. S. F. Chapman, of Vir
ginia, an old friend, had approached Sen
ator. White on the subject. The colonel,
knowing that Mr. Daniels was acting in
a spirit of friendship, deemed it best, how
ever, :to inform Senator White that the
action of Mr' Daniels was taken without
his knowledge or consent.
In his letter to Senator "White Colonel
MoEby, speaking of General Miles' sug
gestion that political influence be secured,
wrote: "To this I replied that I had no in
fluence to rely on except my record as a
soldier, with which the President and the
Secretary of War ought to be familiar, as
they served in the Shenandoah Valley,
and especially, as the President in the
lirst interview I had with him told me
that I had kept him miserable all the
time he was â¢ there. By my answer to
General Miles I did not mean to intimate
an opinion that I had exhibited military
capacity that warranted my appointment
but that in the "big wars that made am
bition virtue' those who have the ap
pointing power had full opportunity of
judging of my fitness to command, and
nothing could be said now that ought to
have any influence on their Judgment.
The record was made up and cou'd not
now be amended. I confess that; I nad a
hope that my services would be accepted
by the Government; as General Grant
had paid me a tribute in his Memoirs, and
President Hayes, who served in the same
regiment with President McKinley, had
given me a commission to represent the
United States in a foreign country. I
hope that you and Governor Perkins will
understand this letter as a simple ex
planation due to myself, and not as a
complaint of any one."
In response to Colonel Mosby's letter
of explanation, Senator White wrote:
WASHINGTON, D. C. July 2. IS9S.
Colonel John S. Mosby. Attorney, San Fran
cisco. Col.â Dear Colonel: Yours of the 25th
ult. received. Senator Perkins and I Indorsed
you to the President and urged your appoint
ment, but I took the liberty of stating to the
Rev, S. F. Chapman that I thought It absurd
to request anybody to Indorse you. Your rec
ord must be known to every intelligent Amer
ican, and to assume that anything could be
told the President regarding . your military
qualifications would be to Insinuate a luck .if
ordirary mentality on his part. Nevertheless
It seemed to some of our delegation ' that we
ought to show â we were In favor of your inspira
tions, and the matter was therefore placed be
fore Mr. McKinley with our emphatic indorse
ment. Yours truly, STEPHEN M. WHITE

LITTLE'S ARMY CAREER.
The Lieutenant Colonel of the
Twentieth Kansas May Not
Go to the Front.
K. C. Little, erstwhile acting colonel of
the Twentieth Kansas Volunteers, lat
terly lieutenant colonel of that organiza
tion, denies that his resignation Is in the
hands of the War Department.
In view of certain facts just come to
light out of the depths of Major General
Otis' headquarters, it does not seem to
make any difference whether Lieutenant
Colonel Little has tendered his resigna
tion or not. The probabilities are that he
will bo saved that trouble.
During the three â¢weeks that Little had
command of the Kansas troops he dis
played the grossest mismanagement. He
had never had an hour's military experi
ence, did not know the "tactics" by night
and in fact, to the embarrassment of the
dozen' g-ood soldiers among his subordi
nate officers, it became painfully evident
that I,ittle coundn't drill a line of fours.
Through his many discourtesies he
gained the hearty dislike and ill-will of
the numerous regular army officers who
called, for one reason or another, at his
camp.
The incompetency of the bumptious col
onel soon was known at brigade and di
vision headquarters, and ever since the
matter of his discharge has been bandied
back and forth between the two depart
ments.
It is decided that he shall be retired,
but whether for incompetency or for the
that more charitaoie reason," "physically
disqualified," is not yet settled upon.
EIGHTH ARMY CORPS.
Signal Corps Recruits From
Kansas â A Wedding in
Camp Merritt.
Surgeons W. W. Roblee and Ira Ladd
of the Seventh California have been de
tailed on temporary duty at the Field
Hospital In place of Dr. Henry Page, who
is confined by illness at the French Hos
pital. All alarming symptoms in Dr.
Page's case have disappeared and It Is
expected that he will soon report for duty.
Fifteen recruits for the signal corps will
arrive to-day from Kansas under com
mand of Lieutenant Tilley.
William Spain, cornist of the First
South Dakota band, was presented with
a handsome cornet yesterday. It was a
gift from the people of his "town, Alces
ter, S. D.
Captain Medbury, Company M, of the
same regiment, was also assured of the
sincerity of his friends, and in much the
same manner. The men of his company
pooled finances and presented him with a
sword of exquisite workmanship and ex
cellent eteel. Colonel Frost and Chaplain
David made appropriate speeches.
Andrew Crag, Company X, Seventh
California, and Miss Annie Hollanby of
Los Angeles were married on Thursday
at Camp Merritt. Chaplain Clark read
the wedding service. Captain Sloate stood
best man, and chief surgeon, Major
Choate, gave away the bride.
An Evident Mistake.
Brigadier General Otis takes exception
to the report of the Building Trades
Council, which was published in this pa
per yesterday. The report contained this
paragraph:
During the Investigation of the army Brig
adier General Harrison Gray Otis, of effete
consistency, again sharpened his fangs, rattled
his accouterments and made another venom
ous strike at labor, when he declared that tut-
ther Investigation was unnecessary and only
resulted In unpleasant newspaper notoriety.
General Otis states that the above is
an evident mistake. Inasmuch as he has
had nothing to do, either officially or un
officially, with any contracts for the
manufacture of soldiers' uniforms, or
with the pending investigation. The, mat
ter has not come before him at all in any
form, arW he has not declared "that fur
ther investigation was unnecessary" or
made any official utterance of any kind
upon the subject. He has, however, fre
quently declared personally that army
supplies of all kinds should be of the
best, as the Government is amply able to
equip and supply its soldiers in the best
manner, and to have either the Govern
ment or its soldiers imposed upon by dis
honest contractors is nothing less than
an outrage.
Christian Endeavor Concert.
An enjoyable concert under the auspicea
of the Christian Endeavor societies was
given at Camp Merritt on Thursday even
ing. Messrs. Pellicano sent a generous
donation of roses and maidenhair fern.
The programme included selections by
Mrs. J. H. Norris, Mr. France of the
Eighth Regiment, Mrs. A. M. Grant, Miss
Elaine Duhem, Mrs. Robinson, George
West, J. Saddler, Master Raymond Walsh,
Miss Cordelia A. Tannahill, Miss Adele
Legon and Mrs. B. F. Stacey. Appro
priate remarks were made by Rev. Mr.
Woods. The features of the programme
were the singing of the qjjartet of "Re
membering the Maine," the words of
which were written by Major W. N.
Meserve, pastor of the Free Baptist
church; vocal solo, "Lost on Our Battle
ship, the Maine," sung by Mrs. A. M.
Grant, the selection having been written
and composed by Miss Cordelia A. Tanna
hill expressly for Mrs. Grant; and the
singing of the "Star Spangled Banner."
The committee in charge consisted of
Mrs. E. Howe, Mrs. B. F. Stacey, Mrs.
J. H. Norris and Miss C. A. Tannahill.

ThJE DEWEY MONUMENT.
BY far the best suggestion yet made in regard to
the proposed monument to Admiral Dewey is
that of Charles Goodall, published in The Call
yesterday. This suggestion proposes that the monu
ment be erected on the summit of Telegraph Hill. It
therefore implies a double improvement for the city.
First an addition to our heroic monuments, and sec
ond a dedication of Telegraph Hill to a fitting and
noble use.
The pioneers .of San Francisco early recognized the
commanding and picturesque beauty of Telegraph
Hill and its adaptability to public use as the site of
a park and recreation ground. By the liberality and
far-sighted civic patriotism of a number of public
spirited men the lots on the summit of the hill were
given to the city for such purposes, and a good deal
of money was expended in building a wall and making
other improvements to fit the location for the purpose
intended. The property is still owned by the muni
cipality, but of late it has been neglected, and at
the present time even the superb view to be had from
the lofty site rarely tempts any considerable number
of citizens to ascend to the spot.
Despite the public indifference, however, Telegraph
Hill, by reason of its location and natural dignity,
remains the most conspicuous feature of the city. It
is not the loftiest of our hills, but standing as it
does separate from the others, rising abruptly from
the very waters of the bay, and commanding an out
look over city and bay and Golden Gate, it is the
most distinct and impressive eminence on the penin
sula. Moreover, as a picturesque site within the limits
of an incorporated city it has not its equal in the
United States and no superior in the world.
Colton Hill, in Edinburgh, an eminence of a some
what similar character, has been taken advantage of
by the artistic Scots to add to the romantic beauty of
their capital. On the summit of Colton Scottish pa
triotism at one time designed to erect a temple of
fame to equal in magnitude and grandeur the Par
thenon at Athens. The aim has never been com
pletely carried out, but massive walls and superb
monolithic columns crown the summit of the hill and
give it an added dignity. From that height floats the
banner of the empire, there every evening the people
gather to look with delight over the wide expanse of
ocean and hills that girdle Edinburgh round, and
there at sunset the pipers of the regiment in garrison
march round and round the hiil and salute the flag
and the descending sun with strains of military music.
Telegraph Hill is by nature a nobler eminence than
Colton. It commands a broader and more pictur
esque view. It is a part of a richer and more pop
ulous city. It is to be the striking feature of the great
boulevard system designed to skirt the north shore
and provide San Francisco with the most superb
driveway in the world. As such the hill should be
preserved from further destruction by quarrying and
grading. It should be suitably adorned as the chiefest
ornament of the downtown portion of the city, and
it would be most appropriate to use it as a site for
heroic monuments. By his victory at Manila Dewey
saved San Francisco from all danger of Spanish at
tack, and it would be most appropriate that his mon
ument should stand on the natural watch height of
the city, whence the spirit of the hero would
ever seem to guard our commerce and defy our foes.
Blanco has again been cut off from cable communi
cation. He has had this experience often, the puzzle
being that he does not seem to know it and goes right
on communicating.
Tripping through the Suez canal at $160,000 a trip
would seem a little expensive as amusement for the
Spanish fleet. It would be cheaper to go ashore and
get up a bullfight.
People who wonder why the war came to a pause
have forgotten that Truthful Jeems Creelman is laid
up with a bullet through his bump of assurance. How
could it go on?
The best wish for the expert French gunners on
board the fleet of Camara is that they wear shirts
proof against thirteen-inch shells and know how to
swim-
The new ferry depot will soon be ready for use, and
the steal connected with its construction not visible
to the naked eye of a Grand Juryman.
If Aguinaldo take Manila the process of taking U
from him will be as easy as though the Spanish were
in possession, and quite as important.
Of course it has come at last, and really it was over
due. The story of the woman who jilted Cervera is
now in the hands of the printer.
In the matter of fiction Blanco evidently does not
intend that any yellow correspondent shall leave him
altogether in the shade.
Austria shows signs of no longer desiring to be im
pertinent. Evidently Austria reads the papers.
It would appear that the Spanish lack the courage
to surrender.
THE REWARD OF HOBSON.
WHATEVER may be the gratification of Hob
son over the reward the Government has pre
pared for him in the way of promotion and
increased pay, it is probable he will not find it so
pleasing and grateful to his heart as that which was
given him by the army on his release, when the
troops received him not merely with the cheering
ordinarily given to a popular hero, but with hearty
handshakes and words that express a personal friend
ship and comradeship in danger and glory.
We are told by the dispatches that the exchange of
prisoners by which Hobson was released took place
in full view of both the American and Spanish sol
diers who held the front lines at that part of the field.
When Hobson and his little band of companions who
were captured with him arrived at the first line of
the American entrenchments the troops literally fell
upon them. The heroes found every hand extended
to them, and every grasp was given with the grip of
admiration and genuine affection.
The released men found this reception too much
for their self-restraint. Heroes they are, drilled to
discipline, and trained to overcome emotion, but at
this reception from their comrades in arms they gave
way to their profound feelings of gladness and joy.
We are told that the tears rolled down their cheeks,
and that they were completely overcome by the
warmth with which they were greeted. Their re
ward for valor and daring in the service had come
to them in the voices of their fellow soldiers, and
all that the President or the people can do hereafter
will seem cold in comparison to that heartfelt recep
tion and spontaneous manifestation of honor.
It is not strange that this should be so. By no
class of Americans was Hobson's gallant deed more
admired or more truly appreciated than by the men
who, like him, are fighting the battles of the country
against the Spanish foe. No class, therefore, was
better fitted to praise him rightly, or more apt to
regard him and his comrades with genuine love for
their patriotism and valor. Moreover, the praise of
no class of people is so welcome as the praise of
one's peers. The soldier prefers above all applause
the plaudits of his comrades in arms. Hobson,
therefore, has found and enjoyed his best and sweetest
reward. The Government will do much for him,
but the day of his life which he will remember with
most pride and satisfaction is that which brought
to him release from the Spanish prison and the glo
rious reception from the boys at the front.
Cuban soldiers are too proud to do the work re
quired of American volunteers, but their haughti
ness is not so marked as to prevent them from eating
the bread of charity when they can get it. Altogether
the Cuban does not come up to the ideal formed of
him. He is far better as an abstraction than in the
lazy concrete.
While School Directors are threatening to resign
the public awaits hopefully a demonstration that the
threat is not a bluff. The Directors have not done
much for the community, but considerable to it, and a
lot of resignations would be evidence of desire to
make amends.
SOME MYSTERIES OF SPAIN.
AS the war progresses the strangeness of the
Spanish character becomes more and more
manifest. Diplomacy as exemplified in Madrid
seems madness, taking at times a form almost gro
tesque. From the beginning there has not been a
single move indicating intelligent direction. Every
act of the Ministry, leading inevitably to disaster, but
paves the way for an act more unreasonable. The
Spanish mind does not appear to grasp the situation
or to realize that each new embarrassment arises
as the definite result of a definite cau c ,e. Perhaps
Madrid expects a miracle to intervene. Such an ex
pectation would be no more out of consonance with
sanity than has been the course of the Ministry.
Neither does there stand out plainly a logical ex
cuse for the elaborate system of lying which was early
inaugurated and is adhered to faithfully. If the people
of Spain are to be long deceived by falsehoods so pal
pable they have sunk to a degree of ignorance even
more abject than had been supposed, and if the re
action at last shall not be more frightful because of
the false hopes raised and the phantom victories an
nounced, they are intellectually dense as the beasts of
the field.
When the ships of Cervera started on their last
dash they were manned by drunken sailors, and the
courage shown was in part the bogus bravery of in
ebriation. There is beginning to be reason for sus
pecting that over in old Madrid the guiding minds
must be stimulated similarly. Spain demeans itself as
though in that stage of drink-exaltation where there
is neither fear nor the ability to repel or avoid that
which a sober man would recognize as danger.
Among the emotions stirred by the terrible sea dis
aster is one of regret that the ruffians who escaped
by brutality to the women cannot yet be taken back
to the scene and beaten to death with bludgeons as
they try to escape drowning.
The Spanish can afford to encourage the planting
of the Red Cross far toward the front As they use
it as a shelter while planting guns it gives them a
safe and to them congenial method of making war.
THE SPANISH PRIVATEER.
RUMORS that a Spanish privateer is off the
coast of British Columbia awaiting the coming
of treasure ships from the north is probably as
true at least as a Hearst account of beheading as she
is enjoyed by the Cubans. However, there is the
shadow of a chance that the rumor is not wholly
baseless, and it is worth investigation.
It is not to be supposed that the Spanish have
granted letters of marque and relapsed vicariously
into their old trade of piracy. If armed vessel there
is along the northern route it is a private enterprise,
not a privateer enterprise in the common understand
ing of the term. That some set of thieves of the
moral grade of those who on land make a specialty
of looting trains may have equipped a long, low,
rakish craft, contrived a black flag out of mourning
goods and be now flying the sable emblem along the
route of the treasure ships, is within the bounds of
possibility, yet not far enough within to cause imme
diate alarm.
We trust that such fears as may have been aroused
will be speedily allayed. Nobody ever beheld the
Jobberwock, yet who shall presume to say there is
no Jobberwock? Still, the likelihood of its exist
ence is too remote to cause an active sensation of
that creepy feeling. We know that it may exist,
and we know the blood-curdling ship may be skipping
along the main with all sail set, skall and cross
bones at the fore, and the captain biting the blade
of a large knife as he peers out over the deep and the
Alaskan breezes toy with his wealth of fierce whiskers.
Editor Hearst has not yet explained why individu
ally he has out-lied his paid liars.
General Shafter says that Correspondent Hearst
has lied. We are betting that Shafter is right
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 9, 1898.
WHAT WILL THEY HAVE?
IT is instructive to bring together the issues offered
by different members and organs of the Bryan
Democracy. One is opposed to the war revenue
bill because it does not provide sufficient taxation
to pay all preparative and current expenses of the war
without issuing bonds. This apostle of the pay as you
go idea proposes to make the fall campaign against
issuing bonds and in favor of present taxation. When
he gets to the convention he will meet the other
apostle who is telling the people how they have been
betrayed by taxing them at all. He speaks of Re
publican stamp taxes, and the Republican increase of
the beer tax for war purposes sets him bleeding brine
at the eyes for the sorrows of the poor, who must
drink a smaller schooner and pay that beer tax in
unquenched thirst. He fiercely demands that all the
taxes should be put on "the rich," and as fiercely
fails to say how stamp and liquor taxes can be paid
only by one sort of people and not by another, un
less we have a law compelling the rich to guzzle beer
and the poor to refrain. The same plan might work
as to all other kinds of war taxes, and so their pay
ment could be put on one class to the relief of the
others, but in no other way.
These two manufacturers of issues will meet a third,
who is opposed to both bonds and taxation for war
purposes. He wants the seigniorage coined. If he
were asked what that is he would be in the same fix
as the British statesman who was infuriating the
House of Commons by a speech against some finan
cial legislation for India. The climax of each period
was: "This will cost the Government not pounds
merely, but lacs of rupees." Finally a member asked
him what a lac of rupees was. He stammered a mo
ment, confessed that he didn't know, and sat down.
But one man with the seigniorage issue wants it
coined, and for the rest of the war expenses he wants
issued irredeemable paper currency that shall be an
unlimited legal tender for all debts, public and pri
vate. So convinced is he that Uncle Sam can hold
himself up by the seat of his financial trousers with
his left hand while he fights with his right, that he de
sires to expel General Wheeler and the few Demo
crats who voted for either taxation or bonds and in
tends to elect a Congress that will impeach the Presi
dent for signing the war revenue bill and court-mar
tial the army and navy for fighting under it.
These three schools of opinion are coming together
to consult over the means and ways of voting a want
of confidence in the President, while he goes on
straight ahead in command of the army and navy
while they march and sail and fight from victory to
victory.
AFTER the advance of the British and French
troops upon Peking had compelled the Em
peror of China to accede to the demands of
the allies and accept peace on terms dictated by them,
the Chinese authorities, we are told, announced the
fact to their subjects in a manifesto declaring that
the "white devils," having been severely punished by
the Son of Heaven, had dispatched a large body of
suppliants, several thousand strong, to the royal resi
dence praying for peace, and that the lord of the
Celestial Empire had graciously consented not only
to pardon them for past offenses, but to permit them
to trade with his people and occupy certain ports
where they might enjoy the blessings of his goodness
and profit by the wisdom of his counsels.
Were it not for this precedent it would be a
harassing problem for the Spanish Government to
continue to give the war news in a way calculated to
satisfy Spanish pride and vainglory. To misrepresent
events at Manila and at Santiago may have been a
comparatively easy task to the liar who has been
trained by years of experience in Spanish politics and
diplomacy, but now that Watson's fleet will soon cap
ture the Canaries and then blockade the ports of
Spain itself it will not be so easy to deny that the
Americans have been victorious and maintain that
the "foreign pigs" have been slaughtered by the
champions of Spain.
When once the sound of our guns has been heard
at Cadiz and Barcelona, and the waving of our ban
ners has been seen streaming from cruisers all along
the coast, the only recourse left to the organs of the
Madrid Government will be an adoption of the
Chinese manifesto. Sagasta will have to announce to
his people that all these warships have come to
European waters as suppliants suing for peace.
How much longer the Spanish Ministry will con
tinue the war, ostensibly to preserve Spanish honor
but in reality to maintain themselves in power and
preserve the monarchy, is a question concerning
which it is almost useless to speculate. Spain has
still one fleet left. It is not strong enough, however,
to oppose any effectual resistance to Watson and will
doubtless be hurried into some port where it will
have the protection of forts and land batteries. There
it will remain until some freak of Spanish strategy,
as unexplainable perhaps as that which ordered Cer
vera out of Santiago, shall order Camara to put to
sea and deliver his men and his ships over to the in
evitable doom.
The chances are, however, that we are soon to have
peace. The Emperor of China had sense enough to
perceive that when suppliants came by thousands
with arms in their hands to ask for peace it was time
to grant it. Sagasta should have at least as much
sense as the unknown Prime Minister of the Celestial
monarch.
BY WAY OF MADRID.
IF any war news of an alarming character is re
ceived in this country the fact that it bears the
legend, "By way of Madrid," is sufficient to rob it
of terror.
According to late information by this devious and
debasing route there has been a revolution of the
Philippine insurgents against the Americans. That
there should have been a manifestation of hostility
by people who consent to be led by the easily
purchased-and-hard-to-keep-bought Aguinaldo would
not have smitten us with surprise. Many Americans
believe that the principal trouble in the islands is to
come from the natives, who have every reason to be
grateful for rescue from the clutch of Spain and ought
to be glad to accept any government offered them,
certain it would be better than they ever knew.
This particular Madrid dispatch betrayed itself un
necessarily by giving as a reason for the hostility the
presence among the American troops of a number of
negroes. There are no negroes among the troops.
Just why a people whose skins vary from lemon color
to a dirty brown should object to negroes, anyhow,
does not seem quite clear.
But there is no violation of confidence in telling
Spain that this country has some colored soldiers,
that they have won a reputation for righting nobly,
and, while their appetites are good, would rather fight
Spaniards than eat. Doubtless the Spanish would
draw the color line even more rigidly if they realized
that many of their dead in the trenches about San
tiago are there as a result of a visitation of negroes
wearing the uniform of Uncle Sam.
Let us look on the bright side of annexation. We
have Dole's whiskers now.
ON TO SPAIN.

down the flagstones of the Palace Hotel
court a few nights ago. "Yet the base

compared with which the bitterness of
quinine becomes the quintessence of
sugar-cane.
"His name is Hart, and that la enough
to identify him. We were lounging about
the clubhouse at the Blue Lakes Hotel
and discussing the philosophical problems
of life, especially on Its ethical side. The
question of personal bravery arose, and
Hart said that he was strong in the be
lief that if he should meet with an acci
dent on the lake imperiling his life not
one of us (mentioning a few of my friends
who were rusticating with me) would
come to his rescue. Now, I rarely bet, but
something impelled me to offer a wager
of $50 that if he (Hart) should be in a
dangerous position not one of the party
would falter in risking his own life to
save Hart's. I did not think further of
the matter, but the very next day one of
my friends came to me and said he had
overheard the conversation between Hart
and myself the preceding night, and
thanked me for the stand I took.
"That night it was sweltering hot, and
we were out on the lake. Hart was sail
ing with one of the party whom he had
maligned, and I was in a rowboat with
the others whose courage he had called
into question. Suddenly a cry of 'Help!
Save me!' broke out on the stillness of
the night, and we recognized the voice of
Hart. With one accord the four of us in
the boat were in the water in an instant,
swimming toward the fear-stricken sailor.
We reached him some time after he had
found the gunwale of his capsized boat,
and all we got for our pains was a con
catenation of imprecations for being a lot
of fools. You see, Hart lost his bet. He
swears that it was all preconcerted, as we
were in our bathing suits. He Is right.
He was purposely capsized, and a few
small bottles were emptied for various
reasons."

TOWlKGâ Steuart Street, City. This

from the tug to the 2500-ton ship and used

than five knots an hour?" This question

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Two Lessons.
The Klondike episode has taught two valu-
able lessons.
The first is that there is a vast difference
between the qualities of different baking
powders.
The second is the great superiority of the
Royal Baking Powder over others.
These lessons are enforced from practical
experience, and are entirely convincing.
Mr. Ladue, the famous traprter and miner,
for many years agent of the Alaska Commer-
cial Company and present owner of Dawson
City, says that no other powder gave equal
satisfaction in that climate, and the experience
of his customers was such that they always
insisted upon having the Royal.
Mr. McQuesten, who has lived and traded
in Alaska for years, says the Royal is the
only baking powder that will endure the cli-
matic changes of that region. >
The qualities which make the Royal the
only baking powder profitable to use in the
Klondike are quite as indispensable to a powder
that shall work perfectly at home. The short-
comings of other powders are quite as fatal to
their usefulness and healthfulness here as in
Alaska ; they are only made more apparent by
the peculiar conditions under which they are
used at the North. The superior qualities of
the Royal are peculiar to itself and make it
the best for use everywhere.
ROYAL BAKING POWDER CO., NEW YORK.
1 came up for discussion, 'Why is it that
a steam cylinder wears more at the ends
than in the middle?' After a great many
had expressed their opinion as to why it
was so, a quiet old Scotchman asked an
other question, 'Does a steam cylinder
wear more at the ends than it does at the
middle?' and no one seemed able to an
swer the question. The fact is that the
same power as developed by the engines
of the Fearless in towing a ship, if ap
plied directly in the ship itself, would de
velop a little more speed than she made
when being towed. Take, for instance,
the P. I. Company's steamer San Ma
teo, carrying coal between the sound and
this port, which has a registered tonnage
gross of 2927. The speed of this vessel is
just nine knots, and the power of the en
gines is practically the same as that of
the Fearless. The Fearless could not tow
this vessel as fast as her own engines
propel her. The difference would be just
the resistance of the Fearless added to
the ship she was towing. I There is a kind
of popular belief In regard to the towing
of vessels that is somewhat difficult to ac
count for the origin of, ftut it has no
foundation whatever in fact."

HOT RETORTS EXCHANGED
ATTORNEY - GENEBAL STILL
CROSS-EXAMINING CURTIS.
The Railroad Expert Tells of His Ex
tended Tour of Inspec
tion and It*
Results.
Whenever It appears that an attorney
or a spectator is on the verge of falling
p at the railroad hearing before
Commissioner Heacock he Is given a gen
tle dig in r a whispered warn
ing as a reminder that he is setting a
bad exam] le. A restful quiet hovers
abou; ibers In which the cross
. Ination of Expert Curtis is under
way, and >â  â â¢ n< vet something exciting Is
said either by witness or an attorney to
relieve the monotony of a technical ac
count i Â£ the exact number of spikes in
a mile of railroad track or the number
its in a given space, all present
Immediately straighten up and are at
attention.
This happened once yesterday, when
Judge Robert Y. Havne and W. F. Her
rln, representing the Kaiiroad Commis
sion and the Southern Pacific Company
respectively, disputed as to a poini oÂ£
law. It came about through Judge Fitz
i asking the witness what bis esti
mate on the original cost of some mate
rial used on the California and Oregon
branch of the Central Pacific system was,
and be answered that he could not say
without consulting memoranda in his of
fice. liÂ«; then drew a typewritten copy
.. paper out of his box to refresh his
ry, when Judge Hayne broke the
stillness of the proceedings by saying:
"1 object to your looking at any paper
prepared by some on>- else."
"What I am stating are statements of
fai'ts." said Curtis.
"There are certain rules of law, and one
is that you cannot look at anything you
nut prepare yourself," interrupted
Hayne. , â ,
Mr. Herrin came to the witness relief
by saying "that is not a rule of law."
"â That is what we think," retorted
Hayne.
â¢Yen can't think any Euch thing,' re
plied Herrin. Â â
"Well we object to it, said Hayne.
"We will ;-sk the Commissioner to report
It to the Judge. We don't propose that he
Bhould look at a lot of things that some
pi â  pared."
Mr. Herrin tin n stated that the witness
i:-.<l memoranda prepared by himself or
under his direction. Judge Hayne came
by saying: "I don't propose to ac
e in that if I can help it. Rather
than have that go into the record we
to have the Judge's ruling. It is a
. o on in that way."
â  i the passage of arms and cv
. quietly settled back and listened
breathing of the participants in the
debate.
Mr. Curtis defended himself by saying
: not believe any man could carry in
the matters being discussed In
mination.
Judge Fitzgerald devoted most of the
afternoon examining into the witness'
knowledge of things appertaining to the
rnia and Oregon branch of the Cen
tral Pacific. He questioned Curtis closely
if the road, how money was
about Its rolling stock, and, in
â  irthing he could think of as bear
ing on the subject. The witness answered
of thr> questions asked but evaded
many by saying he would have to refresh
In.-- ri â¢ ire being able to answer.
Tho Attorney General wound up the ses
king the expert to give an ac
he tour of Inspection by which

â¢ a twenty days' trip using a

SHAFTER'S PLANS
ARE CRITICIZED
THEY CAUSE A FIGHT BETWEEN
SHOE FACTORY MEN.
Judge Mogan Gets Them to Shake
Hands and Leave tue General
to Manage the Campaign.
General Shafter's handling of the troops
In front of Santiago provoked a fight be
tween two employes in a shoe factory at
117 Hayes street Tuesday morning, which
was rehearsed for the edification of Judge
Mogan yesterday morning.
George Tooley Is the acknowledged ora
tor among the factory employes, and his
opinions are usually listened to with re
spect. Tuesday morning at the break
fast hour the men were congregated in
front of the factory and Tooley was de
nouncing General Shafter for his manage
ment of the campaign.
"You're a traitor," said Eli Matthews,
"and if you dared to say what you have
just said on the public streets you would
be whipped by patriotic citiztns."
Tooley could not stand being called a
traitor and he lifted Matthews off his feet
by a blÂ«Â« on the chin. Matthews fell
against alx>x and his left ear was almost
severed. He was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where he said he had fallen
on a box, but as soon as his wounded ear
was dressed he swore out a warrant for
Tooley's arrest on a charge of battery.
The" Judge, after hearing both sides,
advised them to shake hands and leave
the campaign to the general. They de
murred at first, but finally shook hands
and the Judge dismissed the case.

Peru to the United States the same should also
j be reduced on wines from the I'nlted States
I to Peru. Had this Â»Â»â¢Â«â¦> done with France we
believe that country would have accepted, as
the wines produced in the T'nited States are a
mere drop in the bucket In comparison with
the wines produced and manufactured in
France still we could then have sent our sur
plus California wine to France, which could
have been blended with their wines advantage
i ously and thus they would have taken our

CLAIMS THE COURT ERRED.
Attorney Deuprey Makes a Serious
Charge Against Judge Wallace.
Attorney Eugene Deuprey made a seri
ous charge against Judge Wallace yes
terday when his client, John Craig, ap
peared for sentence on the charge of for
gery.
The attorney made a motion for a new
trial, alleging that the court had erred
in refusing an attachment for the State
Controller on the ground that the officer
was more than thirty miles from San
Francisco. Judge Wallace replied: "I do
not remember having refused an attach
ment on any such grounds and I shall
continue this case for a week and have
the shorthand reporter look over his
i notes to establish the truth of the state
; ment of the attorney."
Mr. Dfuprey then attempted to amend
I his statement, but the Judge declined to
i listen and continued the case until next
i Friday.

AT OAKLAND
Aster Ties Ethel Downs'
Mileâ 2:l2 1-2.
ANOTHERCAKEWALKFOR RECT
CLAY S RETRIEVES HIS RECENT
DEFEAT.
John C. Kirkpatrick's Azalea Wins
the Golden Gate Club
Special in Straight
Heats.
Racing at Oakland yesterday was strict
ly high-class and several ol the finishes
were of the eyelash order, to use running
turf parlance. ,
Incidentally Aster, by Dexter Prince,
one of Walter Maben's cracks, tied Ethel
Downs' 2:l2Vs of last week, which was the
trotting* record of the track. Aster weni
a beautiful mile, never offering to leave his
stride, and the quarters were put in quite
I uniformlyâ :82ft, :33* 4 (.eased away to the
turn into the stretch), :33*i, :32ft, and
while Brooks rallied him a trifle he had
the heat safe in a close finish with Gal
ette. It was the feature of the afternoon
and the talent picked the chestnut at 3 to
5 to win, so the victory was popular.
Mamie Griffin, second choice at 6 to 5,
broke going away and finished last.
Sullivan liked her, as she had a world of
speed, but was unsteady or Aster might
have had to trot below 2:12. Dick Abler
j drove Galette a. mighty heatâ she being on
I tiptoes all the way, though very handy.
] Toggles looked to have a chance at the
head of the stretch, but Clark trailed As
ter and never could have won it, being in
a pocket down the stretch. He scored
quite lame.
Pete Williams won the opening even.
with Silver King over- Little Miss in 2:IS,
going to the halt in 1:07%, BO if she stopped
on tiie stretch as she sometimes does t?ne
yet would have enough left to win. Mo
jave made a disastrous break, yet trotted
a great heat after catching. He is a won
derfully speedy horse and can step in
2:13 or thereabouts. Dick Havey had the
mount behind Iran Alto and was fourth.
It is his lirst appearance in the sulky
since breaking his leg last fall.
J. C. Kirkpatrlck'B mare Azalea easily
won the special race in 2:25, 2:24%. Chloe
had the opening call at 4 to 5, but it was
Azalea at 7 to It) thereafter. &fizner han
dled the big mare superbly and just took
enough out of her to land the money.
Cliloe had speed, but was unsteady.
Steve S was driven by Hass and cut
seemingly no figure after the half-mile
pole was reached. Azalea went wide lv
the stretch both heats, then had no trou
ble to beat her field. Mr. Kirkpatrick
was present and enjoyed her victory, it
waa evenly rated, they stepping each
heat almost alikeâ lirst heat, :303i, 1:12,
1:48, 2:2b; Becnod, :3ti, l:12-> 4 , I:4S, 234%.
Kect, of course, won his race, and trot
ted two neat miles in 2:17 and 2:17^, with
the McKinney mare, Mamie Kiley, sec
ond, alter laying way back to the half.
Favor was the contending factor early
each heat, but died away on the home
stretch like a quarter horse in a two
mile event. The little Direct gelding sim
ply toyed with them, and was at 1 to 2
opening, then 1 to 4 for the second heat.
! He has won all his races here to date
: and looks like a low-teen trotter just at
i present. Mabel McKinney was winner of
| third money, but had Favor stayed the
I route it looks like she would have been
back of the divide.
LLsterine cut a sorry figure, and was off
her stride much of the time.
The Kect party got $3 in the auc
tions against their $."> pieces, which looked
i better by far than book quotations.
Thompson threw the talent badly in the j
2:14 trot, as he was played from t> to 5 to â 
3 to 6 just prior to the start. Clay S, the
leviathan trotter, by Grover Clay, open- j
ing at 2 to 1, was steadily played, and j
landed the money by a city block, eased ;
up, in 2 : 15 V*,. Oalto placed over Mojave. !
Once again the latter showed a world of
speed, and trotted the stretch like a
whirlwind after losing breaks going away.
Donathan had the goggles on himabut he
could not be induced to trot awfiy from j
the word, where his friends know;he can
go. They stepped to the half in 1:06%,
| and had it been necessary Clay* S had
i enough in reserve to have reached 2:13
beyond a doubt. He stands about 17 i
hands, and it would be fair betting Is the :
fastest big horse on the trotting turf to- I
day. Osito's backers played him at 5 to j
7 for the lot in the auctions. In the books
he was, during the early betting, held at
4 to 5. Thompsrn seems a counterfeit,
and is not rigged right to trot a first â  â¢ ass
race. Bunch straps his head down vith
j the standing martingale, and the son of
Boodle does not appear to fancy that
mode of hangup.
There were few false scores, -uid In al- !
most every instance Starter Cohen se- |
cured perfect alignment. Galette had a !
I decided advantage In her start, but Ablor
I chose to steady her away where a more
daring drive might have secured a lead
around the turn into the pole, which, once
secured, would have carrred Aster outside
her and given her a chance to have won.
Abler, however, preferred to try to drive
her a steady first half, hoping her finish-
Ing proclivities might land the money. It
was a good, honest drive, for she hereto
fore has made losing brenks early each
heat. These rough galted trotters are
hard propositions.
There are entries enough to Insure good
racing this afternoon, with the winner In
doubt till the wire is reached. A match
race is also on the programme between
"Where Is She and Graiid Central, and it
is to be for "blond." Both are showing

WILL CELEBRATE IN
ROYAL FASHION
FALL OF THE BASTILE TO BE
COMMEMORATED.
Red Cross Society Receives a Gener
ous Donation of Coffee From
Distant Hawaii.
The celebration of the Fall of the Bas
tlle, the great day in the history of the
French struggle for liberty, is to be hon
ored this year by the local French soci
ety in royal fashion. A splendid pro
gramme of musical and literary exercises
will be rendered on next Thursday after
noon at the Chutes, and in the evening
a pyrotechnic display and a ball will con
clude the celebration. As the proceeds of
the day's pleasure are to be turned over
to the Red Cross Society, leading musi
cians throughout the coast have volun
teered.
It Is expected the day will be one long
remembered by the French residents.
The committee in charge has, during the
past few months, devoted all Its time in
preparation for the eventful day. All the
workers In the cause of the Red Cross
will attend, feeling it their duty to make
a partial return for the noble work per
formed by the French Hospital in caring
for the sick volunters.
M. Laurence de Lalande, the local
French Consul, will deliver an address in
French on the occasion and Judge Troutt
will address the gathering in English.
The lowa Regimental band will be in at
tendance and will discourse music during
the afternoon and evening.
From distant Hawaii comes the cheer
ful news that 770 pounds of coffee has
been shipped to the Red Cross Society,
which proves that the grand work per
formed by that organization Is recognized
by the people residing in the lately ac
quired territory.
Yesterday Mrs. W. B. Harrington, pres
ident of the State society, received the
following communication:
MAUNA COFFEE PLANTATION,
P. Peck. Manager.
OLAA, Hawaii. June 23, 189 S.
Mrs. W. B. Harrington, I'resident Red Cross
Society, San Francisco, Cal., U. S. A.â Dear
Madam: Herewith please find bill of lading for
seven bags containing 770 pounds of green cof
fee grown in the District of Olaa, Island of
Hawaii, and shipped per bark Annie Johnson,
to call on or about the 25th inst. In order to
save expense of consular certificate and other
charges this has been shipped to Messrs.
Mlchalitschke Isrothers & Co., 239 Kearny
street, who will deliver it to you free of all
expense.
As I read of the noble work being done by
your society I conceived the idea that our cof
fee planters would be happy to give their mite
for the cause, and I miut confess that I was
surprised at the readiness with which nearly
all responded, irrespective of nationality, in
cluding natlvt- Hawaiian.
Permit me t" explain that this was virtually
the first coffee picked in this district, and from
young trees, consequently we have had but a
Fnmll crop, most of which has been sold or
â hipped; tiniF sonic gave from what they had
retained for their own use, while others bought
or burrowed from neighbors who had yet some
coffee on hand.
Facilities for drying, etc., are yet very
primitive, and for purposes o f hulling and
cleaning the coffee snipped to you it had to be
hauled to Hilo, which, us well as the cleaning,
kjs lone gratuitously.
I also send by Captain Matson of the Annia
Johnson a little coffee in the parchment, so
the ladies of your society may see how coffee
looks before being cleaned.
Ootf bless the Red Cross Society. Respect
fully, P. PECK.
Af yet the State Society has not agreed on a
financial agent at Manila owing to a press of
other business. Numerous applications have been
made for the position, but the matter is still
In abeyance. For the present one of Hong
kong's leading bankers will handle the funds of
the society until other arrangements are made.

Merritt be incited to confer with the enter

before deciding on any date for benefit to
raise money for the soldiers, in order that any

It is a matter of regret that two benefits for

CHANGE THE AWARDS
MfIDE AT DOG SHOW
Mastiffs, CocKer Spaniels and
Others Were Entered, Al
though Not Eligible.
The entries to the Pacific Coast Field
Trials closed on the Ist inst. with a total
of twenty-nine nominations, made up of
twenty-five English setters and four
pointers. Last year brought out an entry
of only twenty-three, with sixteen point
ers, six English setters and one Irish
setter. It la noteworthy that Valiente
sires fourteen of this year's candidates,
and Dash Antonio four, leaving only
seven to be placed to the credit of other
stud dogs.
11. H. Carlton, secretary of the San
Francisco Kennel Club, has received the
following official notification from A. P.
Vredenbereg, secretary of the American
Kennel Club.
"I would advise you that I have can
celed the following winnings, as the en
tries were not eligible to the classes in
which they competed: Class 6, No. 11,
mastiffs, limit-bitches, Mrs. J. P. Nor
man's Lola, No. 37.547, said bitch having
to her credit four first winnings prior to
the closing of your entries, viz.: First
open, Stockton; first open, Oakland, 1896;
first limit; first winners', San Jose, i:>9b.
Class 109, No. 339, cocker spaniels, limit
bitches, H. A. Wegener's Tootsy W, No.
45,541, said bitch having to her credit
four first winnings prior to the closing ol
your entries, viz.: First open, San Fran
cisco, 1897; first junior, Sacramento; first
limit; first winners', San Jose, 1898.
"The rule says: 'Limit class shall be
for all dogs never having won four first
prizes at any recognized show, wins In
the puppy and novice classes excepted.'
There are two similar cases to the above,
one class 60, No. 193, E. V. Sullivan's
pointer Ashbury (formerly Bummer W),
but as these did not score wins, the en
tries may stand. An examination of the
catalogue of your late show has proven
that it is most remarkably free from er
rors, and you are to be congratulated."
The executive committee of the San
Francisco Kennel Club will meet on thÂ«
15th inst. to consider the charges brought
by Mr. Sammi, in connection with the
erroneous transfer of his bull terrier,
Scaldy Mike. Mr. Sammi proposes to
make it interesting for those who slight
ed his dog. The principal offender,
"Dave" Sinclair, has no fear of retribu
tive punishment. "Dave" Is standing
guard at Camp Barrett, awaiting transfer
to the Philippines. He is keeping a care
ful lookout for Sammi. It might be well
to mention that "Dave's" weapon is a
Krag-Jorgonsen, and he carries it loaded
and with fixed bayonet.
The celebrated St. Bernard. Champion
Alton 11, died last week. He was the
sire of more champions than any other
dog of his breed in the country.

The foregoing Is the correct standing of
the baseball clubs of the League on this
Coast up to date. The fact that the
Gilt Edges still lead in the race for the
championship pennant is no great sur
prise, as .they will no doubt win the pen
nant without even an argument. San
Jose, their nearest competitor, while a
good team in most respects, is in no
sense capable of beading them off, un
less that glorious uncertainty of the
game asserts itself, which is hardly prob
able.
The teams, as the table demonstrates,
have not struck their gait. Oakland and
Fresno should be up with the others.
This is so of Oakland especially, as it Is
a good team, despite the fact that it has
lost more games than it has won. The
standing of this team to me is a great dis
appointment. 1 really looked for them to
be near the top, for 1 consider them, as a
team, second to none, excepting 1 Sacra
mento.
Their pitchers are not as strong as they
might be when compared with other
twlrlers of the League who are winning
games. (1 refer to such pitchers as are
not in the same class with Harvey, Iberg
and Balsz. I see no reason why they
should not prove equally as effective.
Mr. Russell's great fault lies in his in
ability to properly locate the plate, and
he should practice more frequently, so as
to. overcome this weakness. I might also
suggest, Mr. Russell, that you employ a
quicker motion in delivering the ball with
men on bases. They steal off you with
provoking frequency, and it is all on ac
count of that long motion you adhere to.
Mr. Moskiman, on the other hand, pays
too much attention to base runners, and it
Interferes greatly with his control. Don't
be continually watching the bases, Mr.
Mosklman. Pay more attention to the
plate. Your Inability to locate it, at times,
is due entirely to your desire to watch
' the bases and pitch at the same instant.
I have said before it is quite unneces
sary for pitchers to do this, and I will
supplement the assertion by stating that
an occasional glance will do more to in
' timidate him than any other move a
pitcher might make.
I do not wish to give the impression,
(While commenting on the pitchers, that
they are responsible for the defeats of the
team, for such would be wrong. To be
frank, the sup' accorded them in some
i games was very eccentric, much more so
than is readily imagined. A decided im
â¢ provement, however, characterizes their
- work of late. With the pitchers giving
better service, the time intervening be
tween their present standing, and their
climb to the top should be of short dura
tion.
The Athletics and "Sand Crabs" belong
j where they are. When the Fresnos and
Oaklands strike their gait the real fun
will commence.
As to the San Franclscos. it Is difficult
â¢to size them up, principally on account
of the new faces visible every time they
play. The rumor that Mr. Raver intended
entering on the managerial role has net
been confirmed, yet there is a possibility I
that he will do so. As owner and manager j
of the San Franciscos he should make the i
thing a successâ that is. if he is capable of
running a team, which I doubt.
There is not much use in discussing pos
sibilities, so I will dwell for a few mo
ments with the tailenders.
This proverbial collection of eccentrici
ties whose unsophisticated methods would
well grace a former age. have won three
games, one of which was taken from the
leaders. [ am told that all they possessed
in this wide, weary world, baseballieally
speaking, consisted of an unrealized
chunk of ambition, with two games won
and a bat bag.
it Is said they play excellent ball when
at home: but if the exhibition they handed
down when here some few days "or weeks
ago is any criterion, 1 must exclaim,
"Terrible!" How they ever defeated the
Gilt Edges is too deep for me. and I
therefore, attribute it to that glorious un
certainty which is ever welcome with the
tailenders.
No doubt, this aggregation will honor
the tail end of the ladder with its pres- 'â 
ence all season. Let us hope so, at any \
rate, fur I would much rather see them
there than the Frisros. It Is simply im- i
possible to figure on their finishing any
where else, and unless they take a braceâ
and very soonâ will be too late to catch
up.
Ham Iberg-. one of the best if not the j
best pitcher In the State, has left the 'San j
Joses. What is this world coming to when
a man of his caliber Is permitted to roam â 
about unsigned? He left the San Joses
because the management : wanted to de- j
duct $10 from his salary to pay another
man who had been engaged to participate !
as pitcher in Saturday's game. What an
unlimited amount of cheek you have, Mr.
McGucken. I will tell you one thingâ that
if such men as Iberg are not engnged to
play ball when they are available this
league will burst, and the remnants will
never be found.
The great trouble with some of you
managers is that you have become inflat
.ed with the idea that this State contains
a superfluity of good players, and in con
sequence such men as Iberg are compelled j
to retire. Now, take my word for it, you
' are greatly mistaken.
If the league contained a few more
g-ood players (you may rest assured that
the poor are in the majority) it would be
drawing better crowds. If you are con
tent for the sake of a few dollars to let
such star . players , go the people who
do patronize the games will discontinue
doing so.
With the baseball public Mr. Iberg is
a very popular Individual. They like to
see him pitch because he pitches â  good
baseball, and the quicker some of you
managers realize this fact the better. I
never saw such a queer lot of business
men (so-called)."
Here you are endeavoring to run a com
plete baseball league without investing
a cent. Baseball is a business, and a very
profitable one, if properly handled. Base
ball, however, will not run itself. It is
exactly the same as any other, and a
man. to make it successful, must invest
his money.
Do you suppose for a moment that peo
ple would go to the Orpheum or the Em
porium and spend their money if some
thing was not given in return? Do you
suppose that if the best actors left the Co
lumbia, the play would continue to be
a howling success? Not much; and the
same holds good with baseball. If you
permit your best men to leave the people
will not go to see the games. Iberg Is a
card In himself, and if you, Mr. Mc-
Gucken, or any other manager, for that
matter, thinks it best to leave him out.
do so and suffer the consequences. He is
worth that $10 a hundred times over, and
what a fool he would be to permit it be
ing taken away from him. I would ad
vise some of these teams to grab him,
quickly, and. Mr. Iberg, if they will not
pay the money, you are Justified in re
maining idle.

IN THE FIELD OF SPORT
ECHOES OF THE
RACES
AT SACRAMENTO.
The marvelous riding of Frank G. Peck
of Tuba City at the annual State meet
at Sacramento last Monday, when he won
both the mile championship and the mile
handicap, the only two events In which
he entered, stamps him as the most prom
ising amateur on the coast. Peck, al
though little known to the racing world,
it not by any means a new rider. He has
had at least a year's experience at the
game, beginning with the Sacramento
meets in June and July a year ago, when
lie showed a remarkable burst oi speed,
but lacked in headwork.
President Kerrigan of the Bay City
Wheelmen saw In him a "comer," and he
was at once attached to the maltose
cross string of speed merchants. That he
did not judge unwisely was evidenced by
Peck's riding on the Bay City team in
the recent 100-mile relay. He had the
fifth 10-mile stretch to cover, and rode it
In 25 minutes flat, four seconds faster
than it had ever been ridden before, and
SO seconds faster than any other man in
the race on any relax-, something remark
able for a new man. considering the tal
ent that always competes in that classic
event.
.Many think Frank Peck a world boater,
but he will have to settle down and stop
all dissipations before he could stand the
campaigning the Eastern riders have to
go through. He Is phenomenally fast
now, and may have a future ahead of him
if he will only half try.
Another new man developed at the Sac
ramento meet is Ivan Treadwell, who also
showed good speed. He started his sprint

however, under the careful training of
"King" Rhys.
One thing noticeable at the Sacramento
meet was the absence of the men of the
official circle. True. President Adams of
the Associated Clubs was there, and H.
M. "Welch, chairman of the racing board.
One could not help, however, but miss

In evidence at San Jose on September 9.
Speaking of tne 9th of September meet
at San Jose, it seems that the baseball
people have control of the grounds and
want to have a ball game that day in
stead of cycle races, so that there Is a
doubt whether the track will be avail
able. As the cycle races will prove a far
better attraction and bring a much larger
gate, the Garden City Wheelmen hope to
prevail upon the managers to give them
the date. It Is a little too early yet. any
way to get out entry blanks and an
nounce a prize list. This will be done if
they secure the track the first part of
August.
C. M. ("Bunt") Smith, the crack ama
teur of San Jose, went to Paso Robles last
Monday, to ride a match at one mile,
best two in three heats single-paced,
against Paul Smith, the local champion.
It took "Bunt" Just two heats to complete
his work. There was a big crowd â â *< the
races, with several minor events to inter
est them besides the principal race, and
every one had a good time.
Hardy Downing, the San Jose profes
sional, has gone north to complete at
Wellington, â¢ Vancouver. Seattle, Tacoma
and. other points, where every track is
controlled by the California Associated
Cycling Clubs and all the racing men ride
under its colors. Downing will have to
meet F. J. Cotter, the. crack northwestern
amateur, who has but recently turned

run to-morrow to Tocaloma, in Marin
County. The members, under Captain
Harry Larkln, will take the 9 a. m.

TO RACE
ALEXANDER PAPE.
Ti.e skiff races which were postponed
I after two preliminary heats on June 26,
I at El Campo, will take place to-morrow
'at the same place. The following events
j are on the programme:
j Junior outrigger skiff, final heat â Victor Cafj
1 llerl of the Dolphins, Conrad Ochs of the Pio
neers and \Yi llium Howe of the Ariels.
Senior skiff â Special match race between
! Alex W. Pane of the Dolphin Boating and
i Swimming riub ami William McCausland of
i the Ariel Rowing Club.
Senior shell race-r-H. Wittkopf of the Ariels
i and J. \V. Lynn of the Stockton Athletic iJub.
Senior outrigger skiff â Entries: Alex W.
Pape and \V. O. Patch of the Dolphins; F.
Wilson. 11. A. Wlttki-pf and William McCaua
latld of the Ariels; Fred Ayers and Chester
j Ayers of the Alamedas.
Though Conrad Ochs of the Pioneers
I and William Howe of the Ariels met in
: the outrigger skiff race at Long Bridge
; last Sunday, it is impossible to say which
is the better man. as Howe's oarlock was
i injured and he did not finish. In rough
water the Dolphin representative would
probably have an advantage, for in the
lirst heat at El Campo on June 26, in
! which he was drawn against 11. Wilder
I of the Pioneers and J. Lyons of the South
' Ends, he alone kept his boat from
I swamping, and went over the course.
A. W. Pape hns been training from the
Triton hoathouse and William McCaus
land from the Dolphin quarters. The lat
ter has new outriggers in his boat, and
will use W. O. Patch's sculls. Pape is
In excellent trim and feels confident of
winning. He certainly pulled strongly as
stroke of the Dolphin four last Sunday.
It was hoped that some additional en
tries might have been received for the
senior shell race, but the Ariel and Stock
ton men will be the only contestants.
In the senior outrigger skiff race two
or three of the seven men entered will
probably drop out. The loser of the spe
cial match will hardly care to compete,
and H. WittKOpf, having just lost or won
the Benior shell race, will likely not ap
pear. \V. (). Patch has been working
steadily, making the Ariel uoathouse his
headquarters. He considers Frank Wil
son of the Ariels, who is both strong and
tenacious, his most dangerous competi
tor.
Except in the Pape-McCausland match,
stations will be drawn for at El Campo.
The races will be in charge of the re
gatta committee of the Pacific Athletic
Association; Al Fritz will be referee; P.
J. Enright, starter: McCailan, marshal;
Titus Brown, assistant marshal; J. Kee
nan, Al Greenleaf and J. Elliott, timers.
There will be ten Judges, two from each
of the following clubs: Ariels, Pioneers,
South Ends. Alamedas and Dolphins.
At its last meeting the Alameda Boat
Club elected the following five new mem
bers: Ed Edwards. William Nauman, D.
J. Ehrenfort, B. Guild and Leroy Pollard.
Five more applications for membership
have been received. At the semi-annual
meeting on the 12th ir.st. officers for the
ensuing term will be elected. The nomi

A GLIMPSE OF
HORSES
WHILE AT WORK.
The high class racing at Oakland, un
der the auspices of the Trotting Horse
i Breeders' Association, indicates that this
j State still maintains its former standard
| in the breeding of light harness horses.
The average time of all the heats trotted
I has been unusually fast.
The best blood is represented among
the entries, and both trotters and' pacers
show it in their conformation and style
of traveling.
Persons interested should keep well in
view Royal Sid when* Crippen gets him
right to go money hunting. He should
readily take a record of 2:15 orthereabouts
by another month.
Jimmy Sullivan Is one of the hardest
i working trainers on tho coast and sits
! a sulky almost all forenoon, then "sights'*
I a few In the afternoon's races. He doubt
| less rides fifty miles a day on a sulkyâ
not an altogether pleasant task.
The barrier is certainly a great facili
tator of starts, and since its Introduction
the racing has been far more enjoyable.
Ethel Downs, 2:10, does not seem to be
at herself of late. Doubtless the mile
In 2:12 U. the other day took the edge
off the splendid daughter of Boodle.
Webster, who teams the horses of C.
L. Griffith, is left-handed. Seldom one
sees a man carry his whip In his left
hand.
Old Mascot. 2:04, the one-time pacing
champion. Is still winning races over the
half-mile tracks and pacing miles arouna
2:10.
E. H. Harriman, who owns Stamboul.
2:O7 I t., is on a visit to California. He
reports the great son of Sultan and
Flectwlng as In splendid condition and is |
well pleased with his colts.
Both Thompson and Ethel Downs have
contracted the habit of tongue lolling. !
Beyond a doubt they would trot better |
and faster miles with this defect cor- |
rected.
Fltz Lee is one of the lightest galted
pacers on earth. If he could go fast
without the hopples he would be ready
money In almost any company.
Ten horses stepped last quarters better
than 33 seconds Wednesday during the
morning workouts. Ethel Downs moved
one in about 31 secondsâ a 2:04 clip.
Maben's green pacer by Sidney is reel
ing off quarters at a 2:08 clip. She will
beat 2:15 directly, and no one ever saw a
slicker galted one than she.
Young Durfee sits a sulky exactly like
his father. He has some strong racing
material in Oslto, Mamie Rlley, Lady
Margaret and one or two otherÃ. Surely
the McKlnneya are great this season.
Lottie seems a popular name. Several
trotters and one or two pacers have ap
peared already at this meeting under that
appellation.
Captain Hackett shifted to a trot and
worked the track close to 2:30 yesterday.
It may prove his natural gait.
The railbirds are watching Rect, 2:l6M>,
closely in all his workouts. There are
those who fancy he is a second Azote if
nothing befalls him. Certainly it takes a
rattling four-year-old to outfoot him
either away from the wire or once
straightened out on the homestretch.
Ed Geers is stepping Tommy Britton
2:llVi, repeats in stilt faster time and It
may be he will reach the Dlrectum
mark-2:0r.i4.
Elloree, 2:09*4, worked a fourth mile in
2:11 the other day at Cleveland and her
trainer George Saunders expects to mark
her 2:07 this season In a race. It is pretty
fast, however. â¢
Queen Alix, 2:03 V.. has been mated with
the ex-California sire, Sable Wilkes, 2:18.
Both were wonderful colt trotters and a
bundle of speed should result. Alix will
be shown at the down east horse shows
this fall.
Few handsomer trotters are to be seen
than Eureka by Ira, son of Piedmont. He
is a beautifully colored chestnut about the
shade of th* old-time show-ring cham
pion, Mambrino King.
Jimmy Sullivaji nas a crack-a-Jack
three-year-old in the bay colt Monte Carlo
by M"onaco and horsemen are nearly
agreed he will beat 2:20 this season. He
seldom makes a break and is perfectly
galted.
One morning this week as a filly by
Nutwood Wilkes was stepping the back
stretch the veteran writer Joseph Cairn
Simpson asked "Where is she?" as he was
timing her. Mr. Carter, her owner, at
once remarked: "Where is She. I shall
name her. She is not named as yet, Diit
that names her. That is an odd name
and not likely to have been taken."
That fast colt Who is It, by Nutwood
Wilkes. Is sick and will not start again for
a month beyond a doubt. He was rated
as good a prospect as has shown to date
in California.
McKlnney. 2:11%, gives promise of be
coming a great sire. Everything at the
track by him shows well and the green
mare Mamie Rlley can shade 2:20 a bit
when conditions obtain quite to her liking.
Arthur L., 2:15, is at the track and jog
ging to cart dally. Later he may make a
little turf history.
Myrtle Thorn traces directly to the ola
time five-mile race mare Nourmahal. It
is a line not at all bad to have in a pedi-
gree.
Few. If any. horses at the track can
pace the stretch faster than the big chest
nut gelding Bernard. Right around 31 3 Â£
seconds it is every time he Is asked to
sprint to the wire. Tuesday he stepped a
half In 1:06 so easily the railbirds began
predicting 2:10 over the Oakland track
should he start on a favorable day and
be at all closely pressed.
Mr. Carter is delighted with the young
trotters by his horse Nutwood W likes.
John A. McKerron by him Is being com
mented on enthusiastically by the Eastern
turf scribes and should return with a
mark In the teens this fall.

WHITE WINGED
YACHTS
AT NAVY YARD.
The nnnual cruise of the Pacific Inter
dub Yacht Association boats to Vallejo j
on July 2, 3 and 4 was quite successful, ;
though there were not at any one time so j
many yachts at anchor at the rendezvous '
as In previous years.
Vallejo was visited during the Inde
pendenCe day holidays by about a dozen
Corinthian yachts, half a dozen Califor- j
nia craft and four or five each from the I
Enclnals and San Franciscos. Of the San
Francisco fleet Dr. T. L. Hill's Cygnus
and Arthur D. Naylor's sloop Twilight
made >Â«.-.ejo on Saturday night. Vice
Commodore G. T. S. White's Bloo" Will i
o" the Wisp lay at McNear's landing on
Saturday night and sailed up to Vallejo !
on Sunday, returning to McNear's the
same day. The yawls Frolic and Phyllis
also took part in the cruise.
On Sunday Arthur D. Naylor's Bloop j
Twilight sailed round to Martinez, re- !
turned to Vallejo and came down to Sau- '
salito on the Fourth. Commodore Dr. T. |
L. Hill leaves to-day for a cycling trip |
through Yellowstone Park, and will be
absent till about the end of the month.
Admiral J. D. Soreckels' schooner Lur- i
line and Commodore E. A. Wlltsee's
schooner Aggie were towed out from I
Meiggs wharf at 5 o'clock last Saturday i
morning and cast off together near the
lightship. The weather was fogÃ-y and
there was scarcely any breeze. The Ag- |
gie cast anchor at Santa Cruz at 11:30 on
Sunday morning, beating the Lurline by
thirteen minutes.
The Corinthians had an ambitious pro
gramme for the holidays: To cruise from
Tlburon to Martinez on Saturday even- |
ing, thence through Montezuma Slough |
and to Vallejo on Sunday, returning on
Monday. The following boats anchored
at Martinez on Saturday: - Commodore
Carl Westerfeld's sloop Aeolus, Secretary
E. B. Lathrop's sloop Pride, ex-Commo
dore J. W. Pew's sloop Truant, "ex-Com
modore A. J. Young's sloop Clara, F. F.
Ames' sloop Elia, A. l. Lyons sloop
Freda, J. M. Mattoon's sloop Amlgo, F.
A. Bartletfs sloop Queen, J. M. Patrick's
sloop Thetis and P. W. Hurndall's sloop
Merope. Ex-Commodore T. F. Tracy's
sloop Seceret went up to Suisun.
The Corinthian fleet made an early
start on Sunday morning. In Montezuma
Slough the Elia ran upon a mud bank
and allowed the rest of the fleet to pass
her, the Clara coming out of the slough
first. The Merope ran aground, but soon
floated off; Thetis anchored at the mouth
of Montezuma Slough, near Colllnsville,
and ran upon a lee shore. The skipper
took his wife over to Black Diamond, and
did not get his boat back to her moor
ings till ti o'clock on Tuesday morning.
At about 5:45 on Sunday afternoon th >
Corinthian fleet began to come to anchor
at Vallejo. Shortly before noon on Mon
day the fleet started homeward,- Queen
and Mlgnon being ; the first to leave Val
lejo. There was a lively breeze, causing
some of. the boats to reef. The cruise was
most successful. .â â â â -.â¢ . ,
The following Enclnal yachts took part
In the Interclub cruise: â  E. K. Taylor's
yawl Emerald, W. Bates' sloop Vixen, R.
Mitchell's sloop Fawn, EL Ward's sloop
Sphinx. AH cam,* back except Fawn,
which went up the Sacramento River for
a two weeks' cruise. , â , ;r-
The yawl Spray, formerly SI wash, for
merly Guinevere, Ik now back at Tlbu
ron, and Commodore J. S.Hanley made
his up-river cruise on the yawl Emerald.
The following yachts flew the California
flag at Vallejo: R. R. THommedieu and
S. C. Delamater's sloop Phoenicia. Secre
tary G. F. Gaither's sloop V and I. L. A.
Sherman's sloop Royal, H. Soratt's yawl
Idler, A. -C. Lee's sloop . Surprise and
Prather's launch El Casador.
U and I started from Oakland Creek on
Saturday afternoon, and lay that night
at Goat Island. She was under way. at 4
o'clock on Sunday morning, and passing
to windward of Red Rock, encountered a
heavy swell in San Pablo Bay. but
reached Vallejo safely. Secretary Gaith
er's only companion having returned by
train, and no one being obtainable in his
place, V and I, was left at Vallejo in
charge of Captain W. Woods of the sloop
Angela. She will return to the creek to
morrow. â  ~
H. W. Brydges, ; on board his sloop
Hope, with Arthur Duncombe. J. J. Han
lon, J. T. Carrier and . others, had an
agreeable up-river cruise, passing through
the slough into the San Joaquin.
To-day and to-morrow are "open" days
on all the club programmes, except the
Pacifies. This club has a race of the 15
footers scheduled, but as most â¢ or all of
these , are not in Bailing trim the event
will not take place.
. W. S. Goodfellow's schooner La Poloma,
after lying for some weeks in Sessions
Basin, East Oakland, has gone south to
Santa Catallna. She was built at San
Pedro, and rigged as a sloop was the
speediest yacht in the waters of Southern
California. It -is said, however, that in
rough water she makes very heavy
weather. She is enroll* in the San

HONORS FOR THE
RIFLEMEN
OF THIS COAST.
The riflemen of this city are highly
pleased to learn that one of San Fran
cisco's best shots has taken the lead in
the contests at the Bund festival. Glen
dale Park, New York. He Is D. W. Mr-
Laughlin of the Columbia Pistol and Rifle
Club, and though his score of 46 on the
standard American target will no doubt
be beaten, still he upheld the honor of the
State by taking the lead.
F. O. Young of the same club and
Messrs. Stettin and Heise of the San
Franc4sco Schuetzen Verein are still to
be heard from. It is believed that they
will not be far from the head when the
prizes and honors are awarded the win
ners. J. E. Gorman, another of the Co
lumbia's beat shots, has gone to the East.
He did not take his rifle, not Intending
to compete In the Glendale events. He
carried only his pistol and revolver, hop
ing that he will have a chance to have a
"go" with the boys of Walnut Hill. Mass.
A prominent San Francisco rifleman now
in New York sent the folowlng message
to his friends on this coast:
Tho f'alifornians are doing remarkably well.
We expect to take a goodly share of the
prizes back to the coast. We have won several
gold and silver medals already. A. Stettin
won the first silver medal on Sunday . F. 1).
Helse also won one on that day. Young put a
sliver medal on Monday and Helye a buflseye
at the point target on the ramp day. On Tues
day Heise won n. gold medal and Young made
a center line on the ir.an tarjjit. Wednesday
Stettin won a Bold medal and Young and Mc-
Laughlln won silver medals. At the point tar
get Mcl-rfiugrhlin made a bullseye. The other
snores have been: American standard target â
P. O. Young, 43â44; D. W. McUuighlin, 44â40.
Ring- targetâ Young, 66; McLaughlln, 68â 6 S.
Last evening the following dispatch was
received from the Glendale range:
NEW YORK. July 7.â ln the National sharp
â hooterr tournament to-day William Hayes of
Newark, N. J., carried off the honors With a
score of 375 points at the point target. Joseph
Singer of Los Angeles distinguished himself
with 47 points out of a possible Efl at the stand
ard target. The score was tied by W. H. Tuy
lor of Pittsburgh and the Callfornlan duplicated
his tirst score In attempting to beat the Pitts
burger.
C W. Swain, secretary of the lone Rifle
C lub, sends sin account of some excellent
shooting by Dr. B. H. Foreman, one of
the new enthusiasts. On June 26, at the
lone range, he made on the Columbia
target ten shot scores, offhand . at 2\Â»>
yards, 61, 56, 61. 64. 70. 71. On July 3 he
made, under the same conditions, 51 57
63, 67, 72, 70, 77. On the last occasion the
doctor fired fifteen consecutive shots,
making a 47 1-3 average. This was done
with a 32-40 Winchester, 160-gram bullet,
nitro priming, bullet seated in shell. The
lone Rifle Club promises to turn out some
of the beat shots tn the Statf.
A number of riflemen in this part of the
State have been experimenting with ;l
new semi-smokeless powder that is giving
great satisfaction in the East. It is very
much "softer" than the ofil black powders
and does not "back up" with so much
vim. The "FF" grain gives better satis
faction, fouling less than the single "F."
Used with a nitro priming it shoots as
clean as the high-priced smokeless and as
evenly and strongly as the straight black.
The "FFFG" acts well in revolver shells.
There Is one thing that commends the
powder to rifle shootersâ the manufactur
ers have not yet joined t"he powder com
bine. When shot straight, the ordinary
black powder primers can be used, but
with a nitro priming a nitro primer must
be used.
The military shots have learned with
regret and sorrow that poor old Corporal
Lew Townsend Is no more. A more en
thusiastic rifleman could not be found In
the State, and so dearly did he love his
old Springfield musket that he adorned
the piece as no gun ever had the honor of
being decorated before. The barrel was of
rich bronze and the stock and handle of
the cleaning rod were Inlaid with orna
ments and brilliants. Away back a quar
ter of a century ago he snot with some
of the best marksmen of that day, and
held his own, and it was rarely that he
missed attending the monthly class medal
contests of his company on the Shell
Mound range, even when so 111 that he
could hardly hold up his gun. His affec
tion for "his boys" was almost as great
as his love for his musket. He will be
sadly missed on the range.

FISHERMEN SEEK
THE GAMEY TROUT
Boca and the Upper Sacramento
Prove the Favorite Rendezvous.
An Oregon Stream.
The majority of the well-known fisher
men are now away on their annual vaca
tions and reports of excellent sport reach
this city from many points. At Boca
are such well-known wielders of the rod
as Eugene V. Sullivan, George Walker,
Jack Sammi, Al Oummtng, H. S. Skin
ner, John Slebe, Ai Wieland and M. J.
Geary.
James Chesley returned during the
week from Boca with a fine basket of
fish. One weighed flfty-three ounces and
proved the best of his catch.
W. F. Bogart has been enjoying the
sport at Boca, which is an old stamping
ground of his. Boca and the Upper Sac
ramento are from all accounts providing
the best sport at the present time.
A. Rose caught three good bass on the
Russian River recently. They averaged
thirteen inches in length and a pound
in weight.
Charles Huycka has been fishing the
San Gregoria and had good returns al
though those caught were chiefly small
flsh.
The anglers of this city have had
opened to them a new field recently in
the Pelican Bay district. Oregon. This re
some forty miles by stage from Ashland,
and is pronounced a paradise for fisher
men. Ihe flsh which are of the silver
trout species are from one to ten pounds
in weight and provide the most exciting
of sport.
J. W. Barnes leaves for the stream to
day, while G. XV. McGrew and family
went north on Wednesday last. G. W.
Wright and E. Langerman left at the
same time, making quite a colony of San
Franciscans in quest of the gamy trout.
DOVES AND DEER
REPLACE
THE CLAY DISKS.
The gun men, who haÂ»e been such ar
dent followers of trap-shooting for some
months past, have grown careless of the
sport recently and now await the open
ing of the shooting season with impa
tience. Deer and doves may be shot on
and after nrxt Friday, the iflth inst. All
indications are to the effect that there
Is game in abundance.
In the near-by counties of Alameda.
Marin and San Mated the birds exceed
in number thosÂ« of any season in recent
years. These are said, however, not to
compare with the quantity of birds in
the district about Marysville, Wheatland
and Rio "V ista. The sportsmen of tho
metropolitan district lind their way there
annually and will be rewarded this year
with heavily laden game bags.
The small rainfall this season will, it
is < !ainu d. have a beneficial effect upon
doer hunting'- The small waterholes have
dried already and this will send the game
In droves to the larger streams. In other
years they have been scattered over a
wide area" of country and were difficult
to locate. As In the past. Mendoelno
County will be the objective point of the
majority of sportsmen. This is the home
of the "doer and is fairly teeming with
game. The majority of the shooters go
by way of the San Francisco and North
Pacific Coast Railway to I'kiah arid
thence by stage or private conveyance to
the haunts of the deer.
The favorite arm of the riflemen will
be of 30 caliber, shooting a soft pointed
bullet, and the rifles of 38-66 caliber.
Otto Frudner has just returned from a
visit to his home in Dixon. In the Putah
Creek district he saw dovea in endlesa
quantity and all plump and well grown.
Frank W. Fuller, who has for many
years made an annual pilgrimage to Men
iloclno County, may not be ablr- to go this
year owing to pressure of business.
The trap-shooting meetings scheduled
for to-morrow include the following:
Olympic Gun Club, Ingleslde. live birds;
Empire Gun Club. Alameda Point, blue
rocks: South End and Golden Gate Club
at Colma, blue rocks.
TENNIS TOURNAMENT
PROVES A FAILURE
LacK of Higb-Class Entries De-
tracts Froro the Annual Meet-
ing at San Rafael.
The championship tennis tournament
at San Rafael this year was singularly
devoid of interest. In former years there
was always a contest for the first place
in the tournament and even the prelimi
naries had a bright streak here and there
â which relieved the monotony of matches
played in desultory fashion. Sumner Har
dy Is now the champion player of the
coast in singles. George Whitney, who
held that title for the season of 1897-98,
failed to appear to contest with Hardy,
the winner of the tournament, and thus
forfeited the championship.
The one good match of the entire tour
nament was between Sam Hardy and his
brother, Sumner. The absence of Robert
,N. Whitney was a sufficient guarantee
that the championship would again re
turn to the Hardy family. After the de
feat of Sam Hardy by his brother thpre
was not a formidable opponent left for
Sumner. whose playing, during the latter
par.t of the tournament, was not a
shadow of its former self. The finals
were productive of as poor tennis as Is
usually seen in the ordinary tournament
in which the result is a foregone con
clusion. Holmes is one of the new play
ers and is as yet undeveloped. While he
give promise of becoming a first-Clasa
man he has not as yet reached that
standard. The poor quality of Sumner
Hardy's playing in the finals was due in
a great measure to the confidence which
he felt In ah easy victory. In the sec
ond set of the match Holmes won six
straight games, which was only possible
by the greatest laxity on the part of Har
dy. George Whitney was on the line
and at every stroke he regretted his In
ability to compete for the championship
honors. He had been playing: an excel
lent game up to the time he took 111. and
then he was forced to abstain from even
light practice. As it is. he surrendered
the cup and forfeited the honors that
went with it.
The tournament has done one thing in
the interest <>f thp frame. The younger
players of the Oakland and Alameda
clubs were out in force and many good
undeveloped men enjoyed the first "oppor
tunity to try their mettle in a champion
ship tournament. The two clubs from
across the bay are progressive and the
members of them ta.ko an interest in the
parno. But fVw of the California Club
players entered the tournament. This
club needs an infusion of new blood tode
stroy the sluggish circulation that now
marks its course.
Handball Players In Match Games.

handball will bo out In force to-morrow.

SHE SHOT A TEASING BOY.
Mrs, O'Connor. Wife of the Architect, Who Wounded
an 11-Year-Old Child With a Rifle.
Edgar Rheinhold, aged 11 years, was shot and seriously wounded yester
day afternoon by Mrs. P. J. O'Connor, an old woman, who lives at Green
and Lyons streets.
According: to the statement of the wounded boy he and several com
panions were standing on a hill In the rear of Mrg. O'Connor's residence
when the latter appeared and threatened to take a shot at them If they did
not disperse. As they paid no attention to her the woman suddenly dis
appeared, but returned In a few minutes armed with a 22-caliber rifle.
Raising the weapon to her shoulder, she pointed it at the boys and fired.
Young Rheinhold fell to the ground with an agonizing shriek, the bul
let having struck him in the left side of the neck and, ranging upward,
lodged in his head. His companions picked him up and by their united
efforts carried him to a place where they considered he was safe from fur
ther injury at the hands of Mrs. O'Connor.
Realizing that Rheinhold was seriously hurt, one of the boys went to
his home and procured a pillow, which he placed under the wounded lad's
head.
Failing to stop the flow of blood, his companions, becoming alarmed,
summoned Police Officer Peterson, who had the boy taken home. Dr. Laid
law was at once summoned, but on account of the dangerous nature of the
wound he considered it unwise to probe for the bullet.
Immediately after taking the unfortunate boy home Officer Peterson
returned to the scene of. the shooting and placed Mrs. O'Connor under ar
rest. She offered no resistance, and after being questioned by Captain Sey
mour she was taken to the City Prison and booked on a charge of an as
sault to commit murder.
To a reporter she said that she had not emerged from her home for
three years, having been confined to her bed by illness.
"For some time past," she tearfully remarked, "I have been greatly an
noyed by a gang of hoodlums, who Infest the neighborhood In which I live.
Last Thursday they entered my premises and created sad havoc among
the fruit trees In the rear of my home. My husband, who Is P. J. O'Con
nor, the well-known architect, gave me his riflo and told me to shoot any
member of the gang who attempted to rob our orchard again.
"When young Rheinhold and his companions started to throw stones
at our little home I first cautioned them, but as they persisted I got my
husband's rifle and, pointing it at them, threatened to shoot If they did
not desist.
"Just then another missile struck close to my head, and, becoming
angry. I raised the rifle to my shoulder and fired. I did not know that the
bullet had taken effect, as I fired at random, not Intending to injure any
of the boys. I am extremely sorry for young Rheinhold, as I did not In
tend to Injure him.
"It was not until the police officer visited my premises and 'placed me
under arrest that I realized that the shot had taken effect."
Late laÂ«t night it was reported to the police that the boy was In a se
rious condition and likely to die.
TIIE SAN FItANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 9, 1898.
OF HER GEMS
Serious Charge Against
George Reed.
MRS. GOOD HIS ACCUSER
THE "DARK MYSTERY" AGAIN
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.
Drugged His Helpless Victim and
Then Relieved Her of Her
Property.
George Reed, who Is known to the police
as the "dark, mystery," was arrested last
evening and charged with grand larceny.
Last Thursday evening, it Is claimed,
Reed and another man whoso name the
police refuse to divulge were walking
along Market streei, wh.-n they met two
women, one of whom w:us Plumas Good,
a recent arrival from Victoria. Accord
ing to the latter" s story, Reed and his
friend accosted them and :nvited them to
go to an oyster-hous<- OH .'.tarket street.
They accepted the invitation, and after
reaching the place Reed, so it is claimed,
called for a bottle of wine.
Mrs. Good was given a drink of the
wine, whereupon she became dizzy, and
subsequently fell asleep. Her companion
and Reed's friend, she alleges, at once
left the restaurant. When she awakened,
some time afterward, her diamond rings
and a purse containing a few dollars were
missing.
Realizing she had been drugged she
staggered out of the restaurant and, meet
ing a policeman, told him of her experi
ence. A search was made for Reed, but
he managed to elude arrest.
Vi sterday morning Mrs. Good visited
ponce headquarters and swore to a com
plaint, charging Reed with grand larceny.
Last evening he was located in a saloon
on Market street by detectives Dillon and
Crockett and placed under arrest. Two
diamond rin^s which he stole from his
helpless victim were found in his posses
sion.
Mrs. Good Is convinced that Reed placed
a "knock out" drop in the wine which she
drank. She claims that she noticed him
take a white powder out of his pocket, but
thinking it was quinine she paid no atten
tion to him.
"The dark mystery" is well known to
the police. Several months ago he was ar
rested for stealing a gold watch from a
stranger on the Barbary Coast, but es

Point Lobos Road Improvements.
The petition of the Richmond District
Improvement Association, requesting that
the Supervisors in the next tax levy in
clude an appropriation of $55,000 for the
bituminizing of Point Lobos avenue be
tween Central and First, was considered
yesterday by the Finance Committee of
the Supervisors. The committee favored
the. project, but inasmuch as that part of
Point Lobos road comes under the super
vision of the Park Commissioners the
matter of providing for the expenditure
remains with them.
LUTHERAN SYNOD IN SESSION.
Representatives From Several States
Attend the Conference.
The annual session of the California
and Oregon District of the Missouri Synod
is now being held at the Evangelical
Lutheran St. Paul's Church, corner Eddy
and Gough streets. It was ushered in by
a religious service Thursday evening at
which Rev. G. Runkel, the vice-president
of the district synod, whose home is in
Los Angeles, occupied the pulpit.
When yesterday's meeting was called
to order by the district president, Rev.
J. M. Buehler of this city, a number of
pastors, teachers and lay delegates from
California, Oregon, Nevada, Idaho and
Washington were reported present. The
president welcomed the members and
made his annual address.
After closing his remarks, a number of
committees were appointed, and the
president of the district laid before the
meeting four theses on "Our unshaken
faith in the eternal divinity of Christ
Jesus in opposition to the religious fickle
ness of our ago." Though these theses
could not be discussed yesterday morn
ing, they were read and in a general
way commented upon.
The afternoon session was given to the
discussion of an "Essay on Parochial
Schools," prepared by Rev. H. Bohl of
Nevada-
"WE ARE ALL FOR IT."
Attitude of California Statesmen on
the Nicaraguan Canal Matter.
The following letter from Stephen M.
White to Hugh Craig, president of the
Chamber of Commerce, dated Washing
ton, D. C., June 30, was received yester
day:
Dear Sir: Tours of the 30th inst., directed
to Senator Perkins, concerning the Nicaraguan
, Canal, has been submitted by him to the Cali
! fornla delegation. It is hardly necessary to
| urge us to active exertion in behalf of that
enterprise. V>e are all for tt. The commis
i sion appointed under the provisions of the act
lof Congress has not yet reported. The Senate
special committee, of which Senator Morgan is
I chairman, has reported in favor of the proceed-
I Ing. The evidence taken by that committee
: shnws a difference of opinion In the official
board as to the cost, extending; from $90,000,000
to $140,000,000. A number of prominent members
of both houses believe it is premature to legis
late until the report Is In. Moreover, then- are
many who think the canal should be absolutely
under Government control and it will be neces
sary to enter Into diplomatic negotiations with
the Central American States interested before
tne affair can be satisfactorily concluded. So
far us I am personally concerned I am desir
ous of forwarding the work, even though we
may not have the best proposition. I advert
to the foregoing facts to illustrate the difficul
ties of the situation. Yours truly,
STEPHEN M. WHITE.
Escaped From St. Luke's Hospital.
John W. Carrick. a clerk In the South
ern Pacilic Railroad Company's service,
was sent to St. Luke's Hospital yester
day ponding medical examination as to
his mental condition. The opinion of the
railroad authorities was that his mind
was somewhat effected from over work,
and ihat rest and medical treatment
would restore him in the course of a
few days. While in the hospital he broke
away from the nurse and left without
permission.
The police at the Seventeenth-street
station were notified of liis departure
with instructions to have him apprehend
ed and sent to the City Receiving Hos
pital when found. Carrick has red hair,
Is about five feet Bix inches in height
and is dressed In a gray suit, with a
derby hat.
THE "UNCLE IN CEYLON."
The "uncle in Ceylon" has for years
: past done yeoman service in the nar-
I ratives related by the "spielers" and
I "magsmen" of the city to their moneyed
â  dupes, but when a veritable native of
i the Indian isle fell into their clutches
! recently they hesitated to introduce
him, and accordingly trotted out his
] "understudy," the well-known Fijian
planter, who has left untold riches to
ibe divided among deserving persons
who will put Â£100, or more, into a hat
i held by two strange men in a back
â  parlor of a second-class hotel. Accord
; ing to the story â or rather one of the
stories â told by James Weerasnoha, a
Cingalese hairdresser, to the detectives,
the substitute failed to acquit himself
\ satisfactorily, so his heir and the in
; evitable other man propounded a fur
; ther scheme for the redistribution of
I the victim's wealth, and drugging the
liquor they succeeded in abstracting
Â£252 from Weerasnoha's belt and es
caping. This is the gist of the several
â  statements which the Cingalese made,
withdrew and modified during his
| cross-examination by the detectives,
! but as several of his statements have
â  been found to be incorrect they regard
; the greater part of his story with cau
1 tion. Weerasnoha has carried on a
business for some years at Mount Mor
! gan, Queensland, and arrived in Mcl
! bourne recently by the R. M. S. Orotava
ion his way to Ceylon. His loss will not
S prevent him continuing his journey. â

SOUTH CAROLINA IN CONGRESS.
That was a remarkable speech Ben
Tillman delivered on South Carolina
when he addressed the Senate in eulogy
of his late colleague, Judge Earle. It
was a glance at the past, at the time
when South Carolina was ruled by a
few powerful families. They were of
the old South, and of them Horace
Greeley said after the war: "They
would not steal themselves, nor let any
body else steal." It was an oligarchy,
but it was virtuous and honest. It gave
South Carolina a cheap and pure gov
ernment; but it was a government of
the few and the powerful. Here are
some of the men South Carolina sent
to the Continental Congress: Bee, But
ler, Gadsden, Izard, Laurens, Motte,
Pinckney. Ed Rutledge, John Rutledge.
And here are the names of some of Ben
Tillman's predecessoi-s in the United
States Senate: Pierce Butler, Ralph
Izard, Charles Pinckney, Thomas
Sumpter, John Gailard Robert Y.
Hayne, John C. Calhoun, William C.
Preston, George Me Duffle, Andrew P.
Butler, Robert W. Barnwell, Arthur P.
Butler, R. Barnwell Rhett, James
Chestnut, James H. Hammond, M. C.
Butler and Wade Hampton. For one
hundred years these men ruled South
Carolina, and few States in the Union
could boast so much of that quality
which In men we call individuality as
South Carolina.â Louisville Courier-
Journal.
SMOOTHING DOWN THE OLD MAN.
"I have come," said the young man,
"to ask for your daughter's hand."
The proud banker gazed over his
glasses at the fellow and demanded:
"Well, have you any means of Bup
portlng her?"
"Alas! I am noor. But hear my
story."
"Go on."
"When I spoke to Claudia about
coming to see you she told me it was
useless â that her mother- was the man
of the house, and that I hod better go
to her. But I said, 'no. Your father
may permit your mother to think she
is the man of ihp house, just to humor
her but I have seen enough of him to
know that when a matter of import
ance comes up his stror- will must al
aways assert itself. His strength of
character may not be brought out by
little things, still ' "
"My boy," interrupted the old gentle
man, patting him on the shoulder, "I
have known all along that you were
not one of those ordinary persons who
are Incapable of understanding what is
going on in the world around them.
Take her, and you may always be
happy."â Tit Bits.
Havana's "cabbies" have little oppor
tunity to indulge in the practice so
common to those of other cities. The
lamp-posts of the Cuban capital are
painted in various colors â red for the
central district, blue for the second cir
cle, green for the third, etc. â and thus
the "fare" knows immediately when he
has passed a legal boundary, and pays
. accordingly.
UNIFORMS TO
BE WELL MADE
Women Will Contract
for Army Work.
A BLOW AT THE CHINESE
STRONG MOVEMENT STARTED
BY THE HOME HELPERS.
Soldiers' (iarments to Be Made by
Those Who Deserve This Em
ployment the Most â No
Coolie Labor.
A strong movement is now on foot to
take all the work of making soldiers'
clothing away from the Chinese and give
it to deserving white women, most of
them wives and relatives of those who
have gone to the front to light for their
country. This step is the outgrowth of
the anti-Chinese agitation in which Major
Long figured so prominently. It was
started In the office of the Labor Com
missioner and ably seconded by dozens of
worthy women and men interested in the
welfare of the community. The proposition
is to secure a factory and power where
soldiers' garments can be made and Â«> ef
fect this an association is about to be
organized. Already a suitable factory has
been found and power without limit prom
ised. Sewing machines have also been
promised at a rental that will be within
[ the reach of the promoters.
As soon as the suggestion was made La
bor Commissioner Fitzgerald and Deputy
| Green started out and in a short time they
i had the promise of some of the best citi-
I zens of the community to help the scheme
j along. Judge Morrow, who takes an ac-
I tiye interest in the good work of the Pa
â  triotic Home Helpers, promised to do all he
i could to help and he heartily endorses the
movement. Tirey L. Ford, of the same
I organization, is also enthusiastic. He
i says that the women whom the associa
tion is trying to help are not beggars and
do not want alms. All they want is a
chance to keep the wolf from the door un
til thtir natural supporters come back
from the front. Mrs. Helen Gray of the
Emergency Committee of the Women's
California Club has taken the keenest in
terest in the matter and will lend her sup
port and that of the club. Mrs. Har'.and
of the Home Helpers and Mrs. Flint are
also enrolled in the same cause, and May
or Phelan promises to help in any way he
CJin. One of the first to suggest the move
ment was a school teacher who says shÂ«
has at least 200 women who can be relied
upon to work in this line.
While the proposition of doing the
i work in a factory seems to be pleasing
to many, there are still others who, by
force of circumstances, will not be able
to leave their homes. These can take
I the work home, and when it is done can
I return it to those who have the con
| tracts. In the matter of contracts there
will be no trouble. According to the plans
! will be no trouble. According to the plan,
; at present, the association to be formed
i will enter into competition with those
i who have been doing the contracting.
This can be done, for those who have
had the cream so far have had a wide
margin to go on. For instance: For
| white duck trousers the Government has
been paying $4 80 per dozen. The con
â  tractors have had the work done by
Chinese for $1 50 per dozen and pocketed
the difference. The projectors of the
movement now on hand say that they can
compete with both contractors and Chi
nese and still make money for the de
serving white women, who should have
this work.
On next Wednesday evening there will
ibe a meeting of the Home Helpers ut
i Metropolitan Temple, at which this move
j will be thoroughly discussed and some
j thing done to help it along. It has been
I suggested! that instead of forming an as
| sociation at present some of the leading
i women can take out the contracts and
1 give out tho garments to those who are
to do the work, returning the same to
I the commissary department when it is
i finished. From all indications it is thought
! that the day of John Chinman'a fat mo
nopoly in the manufacture of soldiers'
clothing is nearly over.
German Lutherans.
At the German Lutheran session yester
day the president of the district took up
the theses prepared for the meetings, the
suhjtct under discussion being, "Our
: Faith in the eternal Divinity of Christ
: Jesus in opposition to the religious
j fickleness of our Age." The theses which
j on the day before had been merely read
\ and in general commented upon were
! then discussed.
The afternoon session was devoted to
' the essay "Parochial Schools" which had
: engaged the attention of the Synod on the
I foregoing afternoon. A joint meeting of
I the German Lutherans of San Francisco,
j Oakland and Alameda was announced fur
i Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock in St. Paul's
! church, corner of Eddy and Gough
! streets.

THE WOOL TRADE.
The clrculnr of Jacob Wollner snys of 'Wool:
â¢'The balance of the wool? at the Uklah sale?
with the exception (if two or three lots, and
also nt th>> Cloverdale sales which w-f-re hekl
the 1st anfl 2d lnsts.. were sold at from 14c to
16c The local market is a little more animated
as there are several buyers in the market. Home
foothills and northern wools are selling at
prices from 13c to 15V*c. Other wools are neg
lected.
"From the East the report is of a still quiet
market, with the outlook summed up as fol
low;-: 'Taking both the inactivity of the
mills and the excessive firmness of the grow
ers into account, the outlook for the wool
dealers is not quite so clear as they might
wish. The trade is practically unanimous in
believing that wool will eventually go to much
higher prices, but they are far from being
agreed that this end will be reached in the
Immediate future. Many do not look for any
Improvement worth the name before fall, and
BOrne profess that they do not expect a rushing
business before the tlrst of next year. But
even if this last prediction should turn out to
be correct, the more sober-minded among the
trade would not bo surprised. The market har
experienced at least three months' dullness,
â with the chance that It may have several
months more of the same thing before it. but
that Is really just what many persons BOW
say they expected. Before the new tariff went
Into effect it was quite generally anticipated
that It would take a long time (some said
two rears) to work thn market up to the Im
porting point. Nobody dreamed thiit such pro
gress would be made in accomplishing this end
as was witnessed, say December 1. 1897. The
ndvame was too rapid. The consuming public
have n^t yet been able to meet it. but they
nre making progress In that direction, and this
Is what is keeping wool so firm despite the long
period of dullness.'
"At the I/onilon pales now In progress the
market Is firm, with prices advancing, with
no wools taken for American account."

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July B.â To-day the stock
market must still be described as dull, though
the volume of transactions somewhat exceeded
that of yepterday. There was still no marked
evidence of outside interest and the list was
by no means a broad one, although many re
cently inactive stocks were brought forward
Into the active list. There was, however, a
steady and quiet absorption of the standard
railroad stocks without ostentatious effort to
advance prices. The Vanderbilts were con
spicuous and the buying, especially of New
York Central, was large and confident. Penn
sylvania also advanced sharply. The coalers
were an exception to the strength at thÂ«
start, not only on the general depression known
to exist on the anthracite trade, but also of
deei> cuts In the selling price of coal and of
prospects of a conflict of rates. In the final
hour the bears raided the coalers for the pur
pose of unseating the advancing tendency in
th.> market. Prices in the group crumbled
away without much resistance, Reading first
preferred losing over 4 points. New Jersey Cen
tral 3 points. This had little effect in the gen
eral list, scarcely any stock losing over V 4 and
part of this was recovered before, the close,
which was remarkably firm In the face of the
Flump in coalers. Much was heard in Wall
utreet of the prospects of an early peace and
even more was made of this by the London
speculators. There was quite an urgent de
mand In the market for London account.
There was a good business done in railroad
bonds at higher prices. Total sales, $2 670 oofl
United States new 4s advanced \i in thi
bid price.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. July B.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrowy will say: Narrow trans
actions and lrregularitv have again distin
guished the week's speculation. The market
opened last Tuesday after the prolonged holi
day buoyant on the news of the destruction
of the Spanish fleet at Santiago. London sent
hipner prices and bought, but the traders here
found that the outside -Ã¼bllc was still indiffer
ent and realizing ensued which carried prices
down after the first ten minutes. On Wednes
day the tone was heavy and dragging and on
Thursday there was a revival of strength under
the lead" of the Vandexbilt trunk line shares.
Friday developing strength in the early trans
actions on peace rumors was followed by dull
ness and declines In the coal stocks.
Dealing in the stock list has been restricted
to an extent beyond what seasonable mid
summer dullness would produce. The stamp
tax on sales, while it is Impossible to say
that it has checked public trading, has cer
tainly checked the activity of manipulators
and board room traders, who have been ac
customed to make a great many contracts In
order to obtain a minimum of profits, which
latter the war tax of $2 on each 100 shares
would seriously reduce. There Is a somewhat
more settled feeling about the crops, but on
the other hand rate cutting is admitted to be
very prevalent and the railroads suffer from
the fact that the heavy movement of grain to
market is over. Consequently some prominent
roads, notably the St. Paul, have shown small
decreases In gross revenue for the past two
weeks. London bought stocks at the opening
of the week, but then showed marked indiffer
ence to this market until Friday, when peace
rumors again brought it In as a buyer.
LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, July S.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: Peace pros
pects have strengthened the markets here, more
especially Americans and Spanish bonds, but
there is very little doing.
Newa of the financial crisis In Chile caused
a sharp fall in Chilean bonds to-day, while Ar
gentines were .listinctly stronger.
There have been n-> further g. ild withdrawals
from th-- Hank of England, but Â£1600 which
arrived from Australia was bought up in the
market for export to Germany.
The coming India rupee loan will be only
Â£1,200,000 Instead of Â£3.000,000. as estimated,
and naturally a good effect has been produced
on rupee i-uper.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July B.â For some time past
wheat has had alternating days of weakness
and strength, with as much regularity as an
Intermittent fever patient. To-day was no ex
ception. Heavy rains In the Southwest and
the continued light receipts strengthened prices
at the start. The general returns from the
threshing of wheat as reported from the coun
try to Chicago commission houses was Indica
tive of a very moderate yield. Added to this
there were a good many apparently well
founded crop damage reports, which started *
shorts covering. There was not much wheat
for sale and the sharp competition advanced
prices. The movement of new wheat was still
j-mr.ll and the demand for old somewhat preps
ing. Foreign markets were easier. July clused
HÂ«c higher and September gained HlÃ\c.H l B\c.
The strength in wheat did not help the price
of corn, except in the way of assisting the
bulls to maintain It around yesterday's closing
price. The clone was unchanged.
Oats displayed moderate strength in sym
pathy with wheat, but the close was unchanged
from yesterday.
High prices for hogs at the yards, an ndvaiv>
in lard at Liverpool and a good cash demand
started provisions strong, but the market .sank
Into repose on the free selling by packers. Purk
and ribs lost 5c each and lard closed 2%c lower.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. July Bâ R. O. Dun A Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will nay to-morrow:
The usual half yearly statement of failures by
branches of business is peculiarly Interesting
because It shows that war and fears of war
have not caused Increase In commercial disas
ter. The surprisingly large and general de
crease in trading defaults would without doubt
be accompanied by corresponding returns as to
manufacturing, hut for excessive expansion in
some lines and the helpless condition reached
by a few large firms in other branches. Fail
ures during the second quarter have been
smaller than in the same quarter of the past
four years in trading and in manufacturing
smaller than in the same quarter of any year
excepting 1894.
The fiscal year has ended with fractional re
sults a hhafe beyond general expectations, and
the new war tax begins to increase revenue,
not seriously disturbing business in any line.
No reason yet appears to apprehend that thÂ»
war revenue will fall below expectations.
Criticism of crop estlmutes is the less need
ful because the best authorities all agree that
supplies for the coming year promise to great
ly exceed home requirements and a full ex
port, though for a month or two yet Europe
may require much more than usual. This will
help to sustain the market, while the earlier
receipts are coming forward, and prices will
then be determined largely by the outlook for
crops al.road, which is not as yet entirely en
couraging. Wheat has reflected but little im
proved prospect, advancing from 85c to 90c for
spot, regardless of the usual stories of Injury.
The cotton crop looks better and the pros
pect Is reflected In a decline of l-16c in the spot
price. The manufacturing works at the North
axe quite well employed, much more than usual
during the vacation season, and the demand
for goods Is somewhat improving. Abroad the
state of the manufacturer does not encourage
hopes of an extraordinary demand for the raw
material, while the stocks held by millers are
known to be unusually large. The South is In
creasing in manufactures rapidly, and not
entirely in place of Northern mills. There Is
nodisheartenment in other textile manufactures
and business Is good and growing In silks,
bagging hemp products and linens.
The manufacturer of wool hesitates, al
though a distinctly better demand has ap
i peared during the past ten days, because
i prices at which Western wool is held are too
I high for Eastern markets, and apparently too
, high for profitable manufacture. Sales for the
week at the three chief markets have been
only 3, 200, MA pounds, of which 2. 290,500 pounds
were domestic, against 14,120,500 last year, of
which C 598.000 were domestic and 6.119.350
pounds in the same week of 1892. of which 3.
651,600 pounds were domestic. The markets are
all dull, In spite of a fairly large demand for
territory and Australian wool in blocks, but
thp manufacturers are very cautious in pur
chasing, although there Is every evidence of a
great consuming demand for goods which man
ufacturers, with reasonable cheap material, can
supply. It Is for them an open question wneth
er they can meet It if they have to pay such
prices as are asked b~ Western holders.
It Is not enough to dismiss the Iron industry
with the bold statement that It is using up
more Iron even at the lowest point of the year,
than ever before. It is getting bigger domes
tic contracts for agricultural implements and
car materials, and also for structural work,
than In any previous year, but especially for
plates, the demand for which quite overruns
the capacity of all the works, and not mainly
on Government account. Nevertheless, the de
mand has not pushed prices of material up
ward, for this Is the waiting and fighting
period, and the producers of pig and of billets
have yet a problem to settle between them
selves. Meanwhile no fall In prices appears,
but a better demand for products, with every
expectation that within two weeks the pro
ducing capacity of the works will be much
more fully employed than fr six months.
Failures for the week ha^ c been 229 In thÂ«-
United States against 206 last year, and 17 In
Canada against 30 last year.
BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, July B.â Bradstreet's to-morrow
will say: While the tone of general business
partakes of the usual midsummer stock-taking
j quietness the number of favorable features
j coming to hand has not materially lessened
| and confidence In a good fall business is still
I widespread.
Business In speculative circles Is restricted
and the new war taxes have had an appreci
able effect on reducing the volume of specu
lative sales by so-called scalpers In grain and
securities. The tone of prices, particularly for
I cereals, has shown a slight Improvement for
I the week and detailed comparisons with re
| cent periods are. still quite favorable.
Developments In the Iron trade are still pa
tiently awaited, but among the favorable fea
tures might be Instanced an Improved demand
for plglron and increased Inquiry at higher j
prices for steel plates at some Eastern points, |
while the Western accounts continued favor
able. Rather more Is doing on export account
In this line of business and the demand for our
cereals abroad Is quite satisfactory. The crop
condition Is In the main very favorable, al
though the tendency now is to discard early
extreme estimates of yield of wheat, and 675,
700.000 to 700,000,000 bushels estimates are more j
popular.
Business failures for the week number 241, as
against 173 last week, 213 in this week a year
ago, 219 two years ago. 266 In 1595 and 225 In I
1R94. As for some time past, the West and
Northwest send relatively the best reports.
A rather more cheerful tone Is noticeable at i
the Southern, Eastern and Middle States. The
tone of trade is quiet, but activity in iron has I
been a feature at Philadelphia, where. no\\
ever, textile manufacturers are nnt very busy.
Pltt3burg r#i>'>rts trade seasonably dull and
Boston gives it as quiet.
The supply of raw wool adaptable to Govern
ment orders has been considerably reduce! at j
that market, while prices of this staple are
steady.
Our cereal exports continue In excess of cor
responding peril ds of previous years, wheat
shipments for the week aggregating 2.725,fi12, as
against 4.716.401 lnst week, and comparing with
2.505,606 bushc-ls thtÃ week a year ngo. 2,167,076
In 1896, 2,317,237 in 1*95 and 2.377.350 in 1594.

BUTTER, CHEESE AND EGGS.
Creamery Butter has again advanced and Is
very firm. When the Butter trade of San
Francisco gets up with the procession of mod
ern progress and has an exchange like all other
large marts of the I'nited States It will be bet
ter from a money point of view, not only for
the trade Itself, but for the people who make
the Butter. At present the sharpest knife outs
the largest throat.
Fine Eggs are steady and some dealers are
quoting an advance. >

DECIDUOUS AND CITRuS FRUITS.
There was a scramble for Peaches on the
wharf and as high as $1 25 was paid. The fact
of the matter is, most kinds of orchard fruit
are. going to be scarce from now on. Apricots
are bringing up to $65 per ton In the country.
Cling Peaches are selling at $70 and Freestones
at J35#40. Where the ; Pears have gone this

have not come to San Francisco.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been three coal deliveries from

one from Australia. 3123 tons.' Total. 9158 tons. â¢
"Business In this line has settled back Into I
its normal condition, and the only liberal buy- |
ers now are our local consumers, as the Gov
ernment transports which are to be coaled now
only number four, and the cargo of one of our
colliers from British Columbia will furnish fuel
enough for the four There are no changes in
prices. The market is firm at last week's
quotations, and there is no probability of any
decline for several months ahead,' as our coal
Importers are engaging tonnage into next year
at full figures, which evidences their faith in
future values. The labor troubles In Wales are
causing serious disturbances to the large Car
diff and Swansea consumers; in fact they are
becoming so serious that the Government Is
about to regulate the differences. â¢ Colliery
strikes are notably contagious, and the last
mails from Australia Intimate that a slight
friction is apparent there among the coal pro
ducers. . which may later develop into a general
lockout. Our large fuel consumers here would
suffer seriously If any . labor troubles should
mature there, as naturally our coast colliery
proprietors would avail themselves of the situa
tion and mark up values. They always regu
late their prices by the Importation cost here
of colonial coals, hence with no . competition
they would increase their prices immediately."

FAMILY RETAIL MARKET.
Fancy Butter is rather dearer. Common
Eggs are cheaper. Otherwise dairy products
are unchanged.
Poultry and Meats remain about the same
as last week.
Fruit is hardly as cheap as usual this year,
owing to Its comparative scarcity. Indeed, there
Is a growing dearth of good Peaches and
Apricots. Housewives will hardly he able to
put up many Apricots this year, and the late
Peaches will likewise be mere or less scarce,
owing to the frosts last spring. Grapes and
: Nectarines are added to the list.
Some kinds of Fish are dearer.

PARTLY CLEARED UP.
Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the bril
liant orator and dramatist and auda
cious manager, was what the beaks
of Scotland Yard would call a downy
cove, says an exchange. He was din
ing at a friend's house one evening and
found himself much beset by one of his
fellow diners of the giddy old maid
brand.
"Ah, my dear Mr. Sheridan," she
simpered, "I should so love to take a
walk out with you this evening."
The wily Sheridan was startled at the
prospect. "Oh, dear," he replied In a
tone of well feigned regret, "my dear
Lady Blank, it's raining cats and dogs.
I'm afraid I shall have to forego the
pleasure until it clears off."
Fifteen minutes later the alert spin
ster, who did not repose entire trust in
Sheridan's sincerity, detected him In
the act of sneaking out through a side
door.
"Oh. Mr. Sheridan!" she exclaimed,
"has It really cleared up?"
"Vâ yâ yesâ n-noâ thatâ isâ it has
cleared up enough for one. but not
enough for two."
In Costa Rica canary birds, bullfinches
and paroquets are special table dainties.

THE REMNANT
TO CONVENE
The Populists to Renew
Their Fight.
FUSIONISTS ARE IN CONTROL
A. BRETZ WILL STRUGGLE TO
SAVE HIS PARTY.
English Hau Destroyed. Much of the
Strength of Maguireâ Budd
Also Has Some
Friends.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
90S Broadway, July 8.
To-morrow morning the remnant of the j
Populists of this county will hold a con- !
vention in Grand Army Hall for the pur- j
pose of electing delegates to the State
convention. There is no doubt that a ma- i
jority of the convention will be in favor j
of fusion with the Democrats for the pur- i
pose of nominating Mr. Maguire. , There
are, however, many middle-of-the-road 1
men who will have seats in the convention
and as they are all orators a lively time
may be expected. Never before were the
Democrats and the Populists so complete
ly rent asunder as at present. Warren B.
English has already gathered unto him
self much support in his light for the
nomination for Governor la this and other
counties, and his friends declare that ow- I
Ing to the factional feeling that exists in
the Democratic leaders of the State, It
will be a year for a dark horse.
Ex-Assemblyman Bretz is the leader of
the middle-of-the-road men. He declares
that there is no such thing as fusion and
that any one who is not a Populist is a
Democrat and might as well be a Republi
can. He declares that Maguire is no more
of a Populist than McKinley and Mr.
Bretz will go to the convention to-morrow
prepared to combat every effort made to
ward fusion.
Mr. Treble, on the other hand, is the
leader of the Maguire wing. He also can
make a long speech, and the light over
the delegates to go to Sacramento for the :
State convention next Tuesday will be !
long and loud.
There is still another element among the ;
local fusionists of two years ago thai be- j
lieves Governor Hudd is not entirely out j
of the race for Governor, and who
would prefer him to either English, Phe- !
Lan or ruire. Alameda county has in
ii many men who are very close to Gov
ernor Budd and should there be any pos
sibility of his desiring a renomination he i
would bo greatly preferred to Maguire,
who is not at all strong in this county.
For the county offices there has as yet
been nothing dene by Fusionists, Popu
lists or Democrats, and whether fusion
will prevail in county and State matters,
remains to be seen. It Is probable, how- '
ever, that the Populists will consent to be j
entirely and permanently absorbed by the 1
local Democracy, as those who favor such i
a scheme are in the majority.
The delegates elected are as follows: i

A GLANCE AT
REAL ESTATE
The Local Tide Still at
a Low Ebb.
ADVENT OF THE WAR TAX
A BURDEN NOT WELCOME BUT
CHEERFULLY TOLERATED.
General Review of the Records, New
Building Contracts, Recent
Sales and Other
Notes.
The real estate market still continues
to be characterized by dullness and al
most a total lack of business progression.
Few, If any, large sales have been re
corded during the past week, and the ma
jority of these, in prosperous times, would
be narrowed down to the ordinary ran
dom note. Along with this business de
pression has come the Government war
tax, which since issuance has been a
continual source of annoyance to realty
brokers generally, as the internal revenue
collected on property will undoubtedly
have to be defrayed by them. Although
the general impression exists that in the
"long run" the property-owners will have
to pay the tax placed upon transactions
made in their favor, it will be at an In
definite period that such a reaction will,
come. The brokers, however,' ' content
themselves with the fact that the money
Is being expended, and the loss sustained,
in the Interests of the national cause, and
consequently whether the tax/ imposed
â will have a tendency to retard or stimu
late the progression- of the market they
are willing to. pay, it and await the
natural and inevitable consequences.
During thÂ« past week there,. were fifty-one
mortgages and trust deeds recorded, amount
ing to {152,513. For the same period forty re

FOUND IN A CAVE.
Carl Wilhelni and Arthur Downey
Had an Underground Betreat.
OAKLAND, July B.â Carl Wilhelm, who
ran away from his home several weeks
ago, was captured In a cave under a
house on Clay and Seventh streets last
night, by Detective Quigley and Officers
Scanlan, Haynes and Ford. With him was
a newsboy named Arthur Downey. Wil
ht-lm was sentenced to fifteen days on a
charge of sleeping out, In the Police Court
this morning:.
The boys had dug an extensive tunnel
and cave beneath the house and had been
sleeping in it for a week past. The neigh
bors notified the police and asked that
they be removed. Last evening the offi
cers named started on a hunt. When the
entrance to the tunnel was found an at
tempt to crawl in was made.- This soon
proved lmposible and an entrance was
d into the house, which was vacant.
The floor was torn up and the two young
sters captured. An examination of their
underground home showed that a vast
amount of work had been done by the
boys.
\oung Downey is not considered a bad
boy and was allowed to go by Judge Allen
in the Police Court, this morning Wilhelm
has been arrested on several occasions be
fore and will not stay at home.
Editor Vivian Assaults a Compositor.
OAKLAND, July Â§.â Sam J. Allen, a
compositor on the Niles Herald, accuses
Editor P. C. Vivian of assault and bat
tery, and declares that he will have him
arrested. Both of Allen's eyes are swol
len badly, while his features show marks
of fists. Allen asserts that the trouble
arose over the settlement of a claim for
wages. It includes $2 50 a day for thirty
seven days as compositor and $.'ls for edi
torial writing. When he presented the
claim he asserts that Vivian jumped on
him and p;;ve him an unmerciful thrash
ing. He expressed his intention of swear
ins to a complaint for a warrant at Cen
tervffie this afternoon.

OAKLAND, July S.â Mrs. Schaffer, ex
wife of Joel J. Hurt of Wyoming, is
likely to lose her reason owing to the fact

children are to be placed in the legal care
of their father that Mrs. Schaffer has lit
tle hope of retaining them after the case
is disposed of next Monday. This after
noon she became hysterical in the office
of Judge Gibson and would not be calmed

THE SAIN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 9, 1898.
OAKLAND MAY
NEED WATER
One of Its Sources of
Supply Getting Low.
BERKELEY MAY BE RELIEVED
MOUNTAIN VIEW LOSING ITS
BEAUTIFUL DECORATION.
So Far the Artesian Supply at Alva
rado Has Given No Indication
That the Wells May
Run Dry.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 8.
The continued dry weather has seri
ously affected the water supply of this
county and there is a possibility that be
fore the autumn rains set in the. experi
ence of Berkeley will be repeated in other
cities.
The beautiful Mountain View Cemetery
is partially wrecked so far as its artistic
lawn and floral work goes by the scarcity
of water. The regular supply has been
exhausted for two weeks, and much dam
age has resulted. The new water com
pany is now laying pipe from its Broad
way reservoir near Fabiola Hospital to
the cemetery grounds, and in a short
time the cemetery will be relieved. A
complete pumping tank is also being
erected on the ground. <
The same company has also made a
proposition to relieve the present water
famine in Berkeley. It has offered to
supply the town with water providing
meters are allowed to govern the supply.
Should this offer be accepted many miles
of pipe will have to be laid at once. The
wells at Alvarado are this year flowing
without cessation. Each year since they
were tapped for the purpose of supplying
Oakland there has been some defect in
the supply. This year, however, there has
as yet been no limit to the amount of wa
ter available for use, and so far there is
no indication of any.
The large reservoirs of the old company
are lower than they have ever been at
this time of year. The Temescal Lake is
very low, while the supply at LakeChabot
is also limited.
It will be impossible, however, for either
company to curtail the supply to house
holders, because in such an event the
other company would undoubtedly re
ceive the whole business of the city.
The Contra Costa company could have
averted any possible shortage of water
by additional reservoirs, because early in
the year the rainfall was so great that
many millions of gallons had to be run
off the lake at San Leandro. As these
lakes depend entirely for their supply on
the rainfall, and as the earth will be so
very dry this fall that It will be a long
while before any water gathers in the
lakes, their supply cannot be materially
replenished until the close of the year.
A civil engineer of this city who has
studied the water question very closely
says that with the growth of towns on
this side the bay the question of a perma
nent water supply is annually becoming
more serious. At the present time each
of the old water companies is supplying
about half of the city, and the new com
pany says it is able, if necessary, to sup
ply the whole town and Berkeley besides
without running any risk of its Alvarado

Special' Dispatch to The CalL
WASHINGTON, July B.â ln a man
ner so simple to be almost perfunc
tory the Senate, at 2:06 o'clock this aft
ernoon, adjourned without day. It
had been agre 1 when the Senate con
vened at noon that the House resolu
tion providing for the adjournment of
Congress at 2 o'clock to-day should be
adopted and that an executive session
should be held to confirm the nomina
tions in the military and naval estab
lishments. No other business except of
the merest routine nature was tÂ© be
transacted. The arrangement was car
ried out to the letter.
For nearly an hour previous to ad
journment President McKinley and all
the members of the Cabinet, except
Secretaries Day and Long were In the
Speaker's room adjoining the Senate
chamber. During that time the Presi
dent signed a large number of en
grossed bills, many of which would
have failed had it been necessar- to
send them to the Executive Mansion
for his signature.
Mr. Morg-" o* Alabama opposed the
proposed adjournment, maintaining
that it would be far more desirable for
Congress to take a recess until the first
Monday In September. He urged that
the war with Spain seemed to be draw
ing to a conclusion and insisted that It
was the duty of -ongress to remain in
session, as auctions of the gravest
consequence might be precipitated at
any moment. He urged, too, that a
treaty of peace with Spain might soon
demand the atU-ntion of the Senate.
After a half-dozen objections had
prevented the consideration of the bill
permitting volunteers at the front to
cast their votes for members of Con
gress Thurston secured the adoption of
a resolution for the appointment of a
committee if fifteen Senators to attend
the Transmississippi Exposition at
Omaha on a stated day. Then, at 1:05
p. m., on motion of Allison, the Senate
went into executive session. At one
minute of 2 o'clock the executive ses
sion ended and the doors were opened
for the closing legislative session.

self.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 8.
Mrs. J. D. Murphy is more than a match
for the gamblers who won all her money
from her husband, and to-night $500 that
Murphy lost at craps last night is back in
his wife's wallet.
Last night Murphy, a young drygoods
clerk, started from home with the idea
that ho could make a little money by
shooting craps. He lives with his wife,
and they have some little property inter
ests. About a year ago it became neces
sary in order to transact some business j
that Murphy should have his wife's power
of attorney. After the immediate use for
it had passed it was not revoked, and is
still in force.
When the idea came over Murphy that
he would like to make some money at
crap shooting he exercised his power of
attorney to borrow $500 from his wife's
account at a bank. He had not far to go
to rind a game, for within a few blocks
of his home he discovered that he could
be accommodated with all the crap shoot
ing he desired. The game was located on
Broadway, near Ninth street.
Murphy started out in great luck. He
won $100* in a few minutes and then noth
ing could stop him from breaking the
bank. He played on and finally found his
pockets empty and the necessity of mak
ing a confession before him. Murnhy went
home and told his wife, but she did not
propose to suffer on account of her hus
band's gambling propensities and she at
once sought an attorney to secure the re
covery of the money.
While the gamblers were congratulating
themselves pn their good luck Ex-District
Attorney George Reed appeared with Mrs.
Murphy and explained the circumstances.
There was no possibility of compromise,
for Mrs. Murphy was obdurate and de
manded her money unconditionally.
There was no need, however, of her mak
ing any threats, for the sports received
the lady with becoming respect and rather
admired her pluck. When her attorney
vouched for the truth of the story the $500
was at once handed to her and she went
home happier and wiser.

THH DAILY RATIONS.
A Letter From the City of Para Tells
of the Joy With Which the
Boys Will Sight
Hawaii.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 8.
A letter has been received by the
brother of Thomas J. Thompson, who is
in charge of the hospital corps aboard
lates its business had been turned back
five minutes in order that tne extra
time might be gained.
Spooner offered a resolution thanking
Senator Frye, president pro tempore of
the Senate, for the able and courteous
manner in which he had presided over
the deliberations, of the Senate during
the present session. It was adopted.
A similar resolution offered by Cock
rell of Missouri thanking Vice-Presi
dent Hobart was adopted with a rous
ing aye.
Vice-President Hobart then, the hour
of 2 o'clock being indicated by the Sen
ate timepiece, formally declared the
Senate adjourned without day.
In the House, when Speaker Reed
announced at 2 o'clock, "this second
session of this Congress adjourned
without day," a great cheer arose, and
then again began a scene which, while
similar to the usual closing scenes of
sessions, far surpassed in enthusiasm
and manifest good feeling any similar
episode in the memory of the oldest
member of the House. The occupants
of the packed galleries, who had risen
to go, paused as they heard several of
the members begin singing "America."
Other members hurriedly crowded
around the Speaker's stand and joined
the singers, until within a short time, it
seemed all the members present were aid
ing in swelling the volume of song.
Presently voices here and there in the
galleries joined in, and It was not long
until members and spectators were all
singing the patriotic hymn.
The scene was a marked transition from
the many partisan demonstrations which
had been witnessed such a short time be
fore. Democrats and Republicans were
now singing in accord the national an
them. When the song ceased, some mem
ber proposed three cheers for the nation's
President, and the roar of sound that
followed game from a united House.
"The North, South East and Westâ a
United Country," was proposed, and then
In turn came the heroes of the warâ
Dewey, Schley, Hobpon, Sampsonâ and
finally, the former Representative, Gen
eral Joseph Wheeler, who is now cling
ing, though ill, to his command in front
of Santiago, was named, and the hall re
sounded with cheers of thrilling strength.
Then the singing proceeded.
Meantime. Sergeant at Arms Russell
had brought in 200 small American flags
and every member was now waving one.
"The Star Spangled Banner" was sung
while flags waved and the galleries
cheered. Later followed. "Yankee Doodle"
and "Dixie." the latter, perhaps, for the
iirst time in the House by members.
Cheers for the Speaker were given, and
then, as the members began leaving,
saying farewell to colleagues, ''Home,
Sweet Home" and "Auld Lang Syne" sup
planted the patriotic airs, and Impressed
more strongly upon the hearers that an
other session was ended.
Clerk McDowell, when the singing
ceased, mounted the clerk's stand and
announced that Allen of Mississippi had
opened a recruiting office in the Ways
and Means Committee room, and a few
minutes later Allen, popularly known aa
"Private John," arose and said:
"The Congressional Rough Riders will
report to me in the committee room and
enlist for Cuba."
The announcement was suggestive of
his speech delivered a number of days
ago, in which he proposed that a com
pany of Congressmen be recruited.
THE LIE PASSED
IN THE HOUSE
WASHINGTON, July B.â The end of the
session of Congress in the House was
marked by two notable Incidents. One
was sensationally partisan, well nigh re
sulting in personal conflicts upon the floor
of the House; the other was notably pa
triotic, and swept away all signs of the
former.
The only measure of. importance was a
bill to reimburse States for expenses In
the City of Para.one of the last transports
which shows that the life on the trans
port is a long way different from that en
joyed by the men in their homes. The
letter was put aboard a passing ship in
midocean.
"Nearly all of the men wore seasick and
suffered terribly," says Thompson. "In
fact, several of the men were so entirely
overcome by pain that they became de
lirious and wanted to jump overboard.
My three companions from Oakland-
George C. Taylor, E. Pierce and J. T.
McDermottâ were among those who suf
fered least. The major has been in bed
since the time he left San Francisco, so
the boys have had things much their
own way. All of the hospital boys are
called doctors, and on the wnole we have
Â«. good time.
"The men are packed like sheep, and
â¢eally they are not fed much better. We
â¢our have a stateroom and are allowed
â¦o go all over the vessel, and as there
Â«n a good supply of whisky in the hospi
tal, it did not take us long to win the
cook over to our side. We are serving as
a hospital corps of the regular army, and
the volunteer officers show us more re
spect than they do volunteers of the
same rank."
Thompson says that one evening a com
pany of the soldiers were so annoyed
with the food that was offered them that
they went into the officers' quarters and
helped themselves to canned articles. He
says the heat is intense and the boys
will all be glad when they reach Manila,
if for no other reason than that they
will be able to take a walk without fall
ing over somebody.
The general health of all on board was
good, except for seasickness, and when
the letter was written the boys were an
ticipating a great time on their arrival
at Honolulu.

A NARROW ESCAPE.
A Toy Cannon Nearly Costs a Young
Man His Life.
ALAMEDA, July ,8.â Al Donald, a 15
year-old boy, made a cannon out of an
old bicycle pump, and was practicing
with it in a yard on Alameda avenue this
evening. He loaded it nearly to the muz
zle and touched it off. The cannon
proved a success. It went off with a
roar. It also went through a board gate
and out Into" the street. A young man
named Frank O'Brien was passing at the
time, and the ugly missile flew past his
face, tearing his left ear and bruising his
cheek. Half an inch more and it would
have killed him. The noise of the explo
sion drew a large crowd, and O'Brien was
taken to a physician for treatment, while
the young cannoneer took to hl3 heels
and at this writing has not been founa.

Court Ocean View, Foresters of Amer

curred in aiding the organization of the
volunteer army.
Handy (D.) of Delaware, by moving to
strike from the Record a part of the
speech which appeared as that of Ray
(R.) of New York, precipitated the dis
pute which brought on the closing Inci
dent of sensational nature. Handy de
clared the part in question was never
uttered upon the floor of the House, and
read from reporters' notes to corroborate
his assertion. Ray declared he had ut
tered every word. The House was be
coming excited, the packed galleries were
i intensely interested.
"Mr. Speaker," resumed Hand", "a
; question of veracity has arisen here. If
the gentleman from New York says he
uttered the words in question I declare
| upon my honor he did not, and I hold
! here the reporter's notes, which show
i that he did not, and I rely upon the mem
ory of members to substantiate what I
; say."
"Vote! Vote! Vote!" came from mem
bers all over the House, who were in
haste to have the Ray-Handy incident
closed. A vote was taken. The House
declined to strike out the speech. A
i division was called for, and the negative
vote prevailed.
Cannon was standing just across the
center aisle, his face flushed and his eyes
fixed upon the minority, growing appar
ently indignant.
"I call for tellers," said Handy, and
with that the veteran member from ll
i llnois stepped into the aisle.
I "You are deliberately obstructing public
I business in which the whole country is
I interestedâ"
The rest of his remarks were lost in
j the jeers of the minority, calls for the
(â¢ regular order and the resulting confu
sion, as Cannon charged up the aisle,
pouring out a flood of vigorous denuncia
tion. He had reached a point opposite
I Ball (D.) of Texas. Cannon had called
! for the yeas and nays, saying it was
â¢ manifest that the Democrats would call
for them. Cannon had repeated his
charge of obstruction, when Ball, ad
dressing the Republican side, as it sub
sequently developed, declared:
"Tho Rt-cord is false, and you knew
it was false when you voted against cor
recting it."
"That is a lie," cried Cannon, and in
an instant the belligerent members werÂ»
struggling to control them. The House
was upon its feet. Marsh (R.) of Illinois
seized Cannon and thrust him aside, and
when Ball asked Cannon "to come out
side," and the latter was moving to com
ply, Lewis CD.) of Washington tooK
charge of the Illinois member and re
strained him.
Meantime the Speaker had been pound
ing hard, and the sergeant at arms, Rus
sell, had seized the big silver mace
and was moving among the members
where the greatest disorder prevailed.
Order was restored slowly and the roll
call proceeded, while the galleries com
' mented upon what they had seen in thtÂ»
course of a visit to Washington.
The roll call upon Handy's motion to
strike out resulted, yeas, 50; nays, 106.
Later Ijm the session Cannon explained
that BalWiad addressed his remarks not
' to him personally, and, therefore, he de-
I sired to withdraw his offensive state-
ment.
The Speaker named Henderson, Hopkins
of Illinois knd Richardson of Tennessee
as a committee to wait upon the Presi
dent, in company with a Senate commit
tee, and announce the readiness of Con
greFS to adjourn.
"Mr. Speaker," said Henderson, after
the return and reporting- the committee

late this Congress upon its patriotic and

WILL FLY THE
AMERICAN FLAG
Hawaiian Vessels to Be
So Honored.
ANNEXATION DOES THE TRICK
O. AND 0. STEAMERS PREVENTED
CALLING AT HONOLULU.
Unknown Man Drowned at Section
3 of the Seawall in "eresence
of Captain Hansen'a
Wife.
The annexation of Hawaii has piven
fifty-throe vessels American registry. Of
these twenty-four arc steamers, four full
rlÃÃed ships, ten barks and seventeen
schooners. The China and Zealandla flew
the Hawaiian flas. hut when the Govern
ment chartered them for transports they
were at once Riven American registry.
The Pacific Mall and the Southern Pa
cific will be gainers, as their steamers,
Aztec. Barracouta ar.Â«l San Mateo, all
come in unrler the new regime. They
were built In England, and for a long time
traded for their American owners under
the British flap. When the question of
annexation came up, Collls P. Huntingdon
took occasion to send them, one after an
other, to Honolulu, where they secured a
Hawaiian registry. The Barracouta was
the last one to go down, and her owners
hai! a preat deal of trouble, as they also
had with the China, in getting her under
the Hawaiian flag.
Tin- other twenty steamers are nearly
all engaged In the inter-island trade Of
thÂ»FÂ«' the largest are the Claudine, which
brought the news of the revolution to
San Francisco; Kiuau and Mauna Loa.
The Claudine is 600 tons burden, and was
built in England in 1S90; the Kiuau is 773
tons burden and was built in Philadel
phia in ISS3, and the Mauna Loa is SJ6
tons burden and was built in l'ori
lilake.ley in 1*94. Nearly all the ot ! i'?r
steamers were built in San Francisco.
The whaling steamer Alexander r.lso
comes under the flag. She was formerly
the Russian steamer Alexander 111.
When fitted out for a sealing cruise a
number of years ago by San Francisco
parties she was placed under the Ha
waiian flag. The Alexander is now In the
Arctic.
The ships that will now fly the Stars i
and Stripes are: The Fort George, Helen ;
Brewer, John Kna and Hawaiian Isles.
The Fort George was formerly a British
ship, but was sold to Hawaiian raer- .
chants and put under the Hawaiian flag. â 
The ether three vessels were built in Eng- j
land for Hawaiian parties.
The baiks, all well known here, are: <
The Andrew Welch, Poohng Suey. lolani, ;
Diamond Head, Mauna Ala, Nuuana. Ft.
P Kithet, Rosalie, Himalaya, Roderick
Dhu and Santiago. All of them are en
gaged in the sugar trade. Ihe Roderick 'â 
Dhu was formerly the British ship of ,
that name. The Diamond Head was for- i
merly the British bark Gainsborough.
While on her way to Honolulu from Syd
ney, N. S. \\'.. with a cargo of coal, she
went on the reef near Diamond Head and '
was abandoned. The wreck was pur- j
chased by Hawaiian parties, who got the;
vessel oif and renamed her Diamond [
Head.
Of the schooners, only two are engaged ,
In the sugar trade. They are the four
masted steel vessels Americana and Hono
lulu, built in England a few years ;igo.
The other schooners are small craft, of j
from forty to 10<J tons burden, all engaged ,
in the inter-island trade.
Ine Occidental ana Oriental ;-nd the
Oceanic steamship companies will feel
the effect of annexation. None of the )
former company's vessels and the Ocean- i
lc Company's Moana will In future be !
able to stop at Honolulu and do business. |
Of course they can stop to land pas-
Bengera and freight on their way from i
China and Australia to San Francisco, j
but on the outward trip they will have
tn Fkip the islands.
Some of the sugar packets are making
long trips from the islands. The bar., j
Ceylon and schooner Spokane are out '
thfrty-four and thirty-two days rcspec
tlvely from Hllo. while the bark Hima
laya is thirty-two days out from Hono
lulu. Every steamer thnt has arrived
from <he South Pacific during the past i
fortnight has reported strong head winds, i
so the chances are that the sailing yes- |
sels are being delayed from the same .
cause.
An unknown man was drowned from i
section 3 of the sea wall last night. The
three-masted schooner Laura slay wan
lying there and the man came staggering
along and sat down on a stringer near ;
Where she was docked. The only person j
on the vessel was Mrs. Hansen, wife of
the captain, and she did all In her power i
to save him but failed. After remain- |
ing seated for a few minutes watching
the vessel the man attempted to get on
his feet, but lost his balance and feu;
between the schooner and the wharf. He '
must have struck the fender pile In h:Â» :
fall, because he was struggling feebly I
when he came to the surface. Mrs. Han
een threw a plank over to him, which he i
caught hold of. She then got ashore and
ran over to the Ocean Pearl saloon, wh<rp
she told the people there wae a mm.
drowning. One of the men returned to ;
the schooner with her, and they both 1
heard the man in the water. The rescuer
was afraid to get into the vessel' B dlngv,
however, and while he was making up I
his mind the man disappeared. It was
about 10 p. m., and Mrs. Hansen can only
give a meager description of the drowned |
man. He was a iittle over the medium j
height, well dressed in dark clothes Â«nd !
wore a soft hat. She warned him of his ;
danger when h^ went to sit down, but
he paid no attention to her.
The ferry steamer Sausalito was robbed
again last night. About a month ago,
while she was lying at Lombfird-Ftrcet
wharf, the restaurant was broken Into
and about $80 taken out of the casn |
drawer. Thursday night some one broke
Into the barroom find secured over $50 i
out of the cash register. All attempts to
trace the thief have so far failed.
The Alaska-Yukon Transportation Com
pany !b to carry on business as usual,
and its two river steamers, now at the
Fulton Iron Works, will probably start
in a few weeks for St. Michael. Josepn
M. Rothchild, as a representative of the
creditors, succeeds W. J. Scammel on
the directorate, and P. DaSSOnville will
also represent the creditors n.t St. Mich
hpl. He will have full charge of the
river business, and will handle all the
money earned by the steamers at that
end.
The Pacific Mail has chartered in Hong,
kong the British steamer Glenfarg. She
will replace ono of the steamers taken
by the Government as transports.
The visiting and local members of the
National Turn Verein had an excursion
around the bar on the steamer I'kl.m
yesterday. All the points of interest wens
visited and t'ne visitors had an enjoyable
time. __
OBJECT TO CHINESE CREWS.
Local Labor Council Making Investi-
gations â Varnishers and Pol
ishers Elect New Officers.
An effort Is being 1 made by the execu
tive committee of the San Francisco La
bor Council to affix the responsibility on
the individual or firm who employed the
Chinese crews that manned the trans
ports China and City of Para on their trip
to Manila. Up to thÂ« present their investi
gations have proved fruitless owing to
the fact that no one seems to know. In
their report last evening . to. the council
the chairman stated that Inspector of
Hulls and Boilers Bermlngham was un
able to enlighten the committee on â¢ tho
subject and that communications were re
ceived from the War and Navy Depart
ments which In effect denied . knowledge
in the matter. The investigation will con
tinue, as It is the unanimous opinion .of
the delegates that it is unhealthf ul ann
highly dangerous to send out transports
manned by such a crew.
The committee was pleased to report the
success of its Interview with Neustadter
Bros., proprietors of the Standard Shirt
Factory, In relation to the young lady
who advocated the raise of wages of
those employed on soldier uniforms. The
outspoken lady was forgiven and is now
working.
Henry Fisher, president of the Tobacco
Union of the United States, attended thÂ«
meeting and addressed the delegates. An
adjournment was taken to attend the
smoker given by the Varnishers' anu
Polishers' Union.
The latter organization, after electing
the following ofllcers and transacting
routine business, celebrated the occasion
by holding a high jinks: President, G.
Gelgerm; vice-president. G. Oakes: re

secretary, M. Schwartz: treasurer, O.
Schultz; sergeant Rt arms, T. Farrell;

been utterly unable to enforce its rights
under the coi. tract made with the
water company thirty years ago. This
fact is due to the loose manner in
which the contract was drawn and to
the further fact that the municipality
has not been properly protected in its
rights under that contract, which it
should have enforced.
The contract expires on the 22d lnst.,
and there is absolutely no possibility
of the city purchasing the water com
pany's improvements to its plant. A
deal cannot possibly be made between
the two parties owing to the complica-*
tions surrounding the case. If the con
tract expires Mayor Snyder holds that
the city cannot give another party a
franchise for more than six months
in any one period. If the city enters
into litigation with the water company
over the contract and endeavors to get
possession at a reasonable figure there
will be weary years of litigation during
which the company would retain pos
session of its plant and the city would
be at its mercy.
This afternoon Kessler & Co., through
their representative, E. Waltman, made
a proposition to the Council which is
substantially as follows: In considera
tion of a fifty-year franchise they will
agree to take the plant of the present
company and immediately Improve it
by the expenditure of 5400.000 to $500,000
to bring it 'up to date sufficient to sup
ply the wants and needs of the city.
They will furnish the city with all the
water it needs for municipal purposes,
fire, parks, streets, etc., free. This
would amount to about $75,000 per year.
They will pay taxes on their plant to
the amount of about $30,000 per year,
which under municipal ownership
would not be paid. They will give the
City Council the right to regulate water
rates, and will guarantee that they will
never be higher than they are to-day.
They will give to the city a percentage
of their gross income, commencing at a
low figure, say 2 per cent, and increas
ing thereafter. This money could be
placed in a sinking fund for ultimate
purchase of the plant. Lastly, they
will agree to clear all clouded title the
city has to the property and vest the
rights now in litigation solely in the
city.
I'nder no circumstances would the
people of this city be satisfied if the
present water company's franchise
were renewed. This is owing to the
strong prejudice in the community ex
isting toward the corporation. Recog
nizing this fact, Kessler & Co agree to
give a bond in the sum of $100,000 that
the present company has nothing to do
with the proposition they are making
to the Council.
Kessler & Co. are a firm of New York
bankers, who have been in business
since 1537. They represent largely Oer
man capital and have handled many
business deals in North and South
America, representing millions of dol
lars.
At the session of the City Council on
Monday the proposition of Kessler &
Co. will dp considered. It will be re
ported by the Water Supply Committee
and will come up for discussion.
NEW TARIFF SCHEDULES
FOR THE PHILIPPINES
President's Scheme Discussed by the
Cabinet and Referred to the
Secretary of State.
WASHINGTON. July B.â A large share
of the day's cabinet meeting 1 was con
sumed in the reading and discussion of
the new tariff schedules, to be put In
operation in the Philippine Islands as soon
as our forces shall have taken possession
of Manila. The formal announcement by
the President of his purpose to collect the
customs revenues of the Philippines as a
war measure had been prepared, and after
a discussion lasting an hour or more it
was referred to the Secretary of State, to
gether with the schedules for final exam
ination. It is probable that the Presi
dent's declaration will be Issued within the
next two or three days, and possibly to
morrow. As soon as approved the sched
ules will be given to J. F. Evans of San
Francisco, a customs expert, who will pro
ceed to Manila., and as soon as practlca
ble after our forces occupy the city put
them into effect. The general direction of
the matter, however, will be In the hands
of General Merritt, the military governor
of the islands.
ST. LOUIS VISITED BY
A VIOLENT RAINSTORM
Cellars Flooded and Great Loss Sus
tained by Storekeepers â No
Loss of Life.
ST. LOI'IS. July B.â ln St. Louis and
vicinity during the past twenty-four
hours 5.08 inches of rain, the heaviest
record for years, has fallen. In badly
drainod section? of the city the cellars
are full and the"lower stories of many
houses are wet with several feet of wa
ter. In the outlying districts, more espe
cially Cheltenham, the water rose to such
a height that it threatened the residents,
who nought safety on improvised rafts.
The stocks of stores in various sections
of St. Louis were damaged. The total
loss will amount to several thousands of
dollars.
Almost all the residents and store
keepers on Choutoau avenue for a dis
tance of six blocks suffered damage to
their buildings and stocks of goods in
sums ranging form $100 to $3000. Other
sections of the city suffered to a greater
or less extent. No lives were lost.

NO REDUCTION
OF EXPENSES
Sinecures in San Jose's
City Government.
JOHN VARCOE'S SOFT BILLET
REWARDED BY THE GANG FOR
POLITICAL WORK.
Mayor Martin's Persistency Secures
the Appointment of His Son
to a Desirable Sec
retaryship.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July B.â The promise that
San Jose would be given a "business
administration" is not being carried
out by the City Council. There is a
leakage of $100 per month in the office
of City Clerk Cook. This is the month
ly salary paid to John Varcoe, who is
supposed to be revising the city ordi
nances, when in reality he is nothing
but a deputy of that official. The em
ployment of Varcoe has been kept a
secret, and no one but the officials
about the City Hall is supposed to
know that he is employed there.
Varcoe's position Is a sinecure, and
was given him as a reward for politial
work done for the Rea gang. When
the new charter created the position of
| Secretary of the Police and Fire Com
mission Varcoe bobbed up for the place.
The gang stood by him and he was
programmed for the secretaryship.
Mayor Martin refused to have Varcoe
as his secretary and appointed his son,
Hippolyte J. Martin, one better quali
fied in every way for the duties. The
i gang were inclined to insist on Varcoe
I having the secretaryship, but the
threat of Mayor Martin to break the
entire slate arranged by Rea quieted
affairs. The Mayor told them point
blank that his son must have the place
or he would refuse to appoint Morrison
as Street Superintendent and Beasly
as City Attorney. Then the question
-of providing for Varcoe came up, and
it was decided to put him in the City
Clerk's office.
Before the recent city election the
people were promised that expenses
would be reduced, and especially in the
City Clerk's office. The collection of
the city taxes was transferred to the
County Tax Collector's office, and it
was said one and perhaps two clerks
in the Clerk's office would be dispensed
with. Instead there has been no cur
tailment. City Clerk Cook denies that
Vareoe is a deputy of his, but never
theless that worthy does part of the
Clerk's work.

SOME QUEER
WHITEWASHING
CONTRACTORS
A Carpet Beater and a Grocer
Secure the Work From
Mr- Burns.
Drucker Accused of Doing Mean Politics.
Side Lights on the Latest School
Board Scandal.
The recent explosion in the Board of
â Education which broke the friendship of
political co-workers who had long la
bored in their special vineyard most har
moniously has some features that have
not been made plain to the public, and
which have peculiar interest.
At the meeting in which Director Gal
lagher shied his castor in the ring, to
the consternation of his colleague, and
Director Drucker with unseemly haste
threw his old chum. Chairman Burns,
down with a dull political thud, some
matters came up that by reason of the
excitement were not looked into. The
most important of these was the con
tracts that had been let for the whit< â 
Ing and tinting of the walls of fourteen
schools. Each was a separate coniuu,
a fact which led to a pointed inquiry
from Director Gallagher as to why these
arrangements had not been made with
one firm to do all the work at a lump
price in the interest of conomy. To this
query Mr. Burns made no reply, but the
subsequent questioning developed th*
fact that most of the contracts were with
one "Frank Conklin." The identity of
this gentleman was not made plain at
the meeting, and an examination of the
latest directory did not disclose the name
of any such man in that line of business.
The contracts in <:uestion were made
to "Conklin & Donohue." Such a firm
being unknown, a request was made to
Storekeeper Graham, of the School De
partment, to permit an examination of
the contracts. This waf very promptly
and emphatically refused. That gentle
man was told that the contracts were
public documents and open to the in
spection of any citizen, but it made no
difference, they wore not forthcoming
from the "private receptacle" referred to
by Inspector O'Brien when undergoing an
Inquisition by the bolting members of trie
board.
However the "kalsominers" were finally
located, and it would take better guessers
than the Strategy Board at Washington
to surmise who they are. The firm is
composed of Frank Conklin of Conklin
Bros., who use steam power to beat car
pets at 333 Golden Gate avenue. His
partner in the whitewashing business is
Thomas Donohue, who purveys ham.
bread and cheer in a small grocery on the ,
corner of Grove and Laguna streets.
Thosf' who ;>.re acquainted with the
facts find it soipewhat puzzling to dis
cover why. with a long list of competing
firms, who make this class of work a '
specialty. Director Burns should find it
necessary to Belect a i arpet-beater and '
an obscure grocer to do the work of
whitening and tinting; or why. as the
law requires, he did not post the propo
sitions at the headquarters of the de- j
partment and give the kalsominers of
the city an opportunity to bid on the
work. Another aspect of the case, which,
however, calls for no explanation, is the '
fact that the men employed by the ready
made whiteners were required to go
to the grocery of Mr. Donohue to get
their pay, or that they were paid a dol
lar and a half a day when the ruling
wage for competent men is three dollars.
Of course, the fact that the contract
whitener sells all kinds of groceries and
enthusiasm was like "the flowers that
bloom in the spring." but that is said to
be another story, which is not made plain
in the elusive contracts.
As to the quality of the work, there are
taxpayers who are inclined to be sarcas
TRACEY COMEs TO
BOX M'CONNELL
The Australian Welter-Weight Will
Train at Sausalito for the
Forthcoming Battle.
Tommy Tracey, who is matched to box
Frank McConnell in the gymnasium of
the Olympic Club on August 2, arrived on
last night's overland. He was met across
the bay by Al Smith, who is in charge of
his business interests, and by other sport
ing men.
This is not Tracey's first visit to the
coast. He arrived here in December, 1892,
from Australia, where he was born, and
was accompanied by his foster-brother,
Dan Creedon. He soon found something
for his hands to do, being matched
against Billy Gallagher, whom he de
feated. He returned again in October, 1898.
meeting George Green, who secured the
decision in a ten-round bout.
He is a more aggressive fighter than
McKepver. and is expected to give Mc-
Connell, the hard-hitting San Franciscan,
the warmest kind of an argument when
they meet. Tracey will train at Sausa
lito, under the watchful eyes of Teddy
Alexander. He will take up his quarters
across the bay on Monday, and will have
three weeks in which to prepare for the
meeting.
McConnell has hardly gone out of train-
Ing since his recent fight. He will con
tinue his practice at the San Francisco
Club rooms next week, and will then put
the finishing touches on his preparation
at Blanken's Six-Mile House. He will
have the benefit of Alex Greggains' ad
vice and handling, and expects to enter
the ring fit to fight for a kingdom.
Weary of Life.
George H. Sandy, a printer, about 74
years of age, living in the Colton House
at 220 Third street, committed suicide in
his room at an early hour yesterday
morning.
He left a number of papers, telling the
story of his struggles for a livelihood
after hand composition was displaced by
the type-setting inachine. He worked for
many years on the various daily news
papers and was recently employed at
Crocker's. In one of the papers he says:
"Constrained, checked, blocked in every
effort to earn my living honestly, I have
endured insults, sneers, humiliation, hun
ger, contempt and poverty until life has
lost Its charm and now is unen
durable. Therefore, seeing no way but
one to free myself from this unjust bur
den of wrongs which has been heaped
upon me by soulless men, I avail myself
of that and so end all my troubles here,
and, as I believe, hereafter."
He had three trunks in his room, which
he leaves to William M. Hinton, one of his
former employers, with the explanation
that their contents will be of more value
to him than any one else. The body will
be burled by the local Typographical
Union.

Sale of Bonds.
Yesterday was the last day for receiving
Fiibscrlptlons for the three per cent gov
ernment loans, at the Sub-Treasury, and
the subscriptions for bonds from $500 down
amounted to about one and a quarter mil
lion dollars. As previously announced As-
Bietant Treasurer Julius Jacobs refused
to receive any bid for larger bonds than
tic and remark that it must be excellent
and worth the money, because Director
Burns conducts a fruit store, and the
contractors are engaged in linos of busi
ness not connected with whitewashing.
Director Gallagher was not of this class,
but he was disagreeable enough to say
that the work was entirely unnecessary,
a fact which caused him to be dropped
from the visiting list of Mr. Burns.
The latter gentleman was much grieved
when the subject was brought before him
yesterday, and regretted deeply that
there should have been any dissension in
the board or any questioning of his mo
tives in his conduct of the work of the
Building Committee. He unconsciously
did a little whitewashing himself in the
matter of contractors, and was greatly
surprised to learn that Mr. Donohue,
whom he "knew by sight." was not a
whitewasher. but a plain, unassuming re
tailer of groceries, etc. Tie knew that
ivir. Conklin ran a carpet-beating con
cern, but that gentleman had "done the
same kind of work for the department
last year, and everything was satisfac
tory," so it ought to have been at this
time.
Mr. Burns was not disconcerted when
asked his reason for selecting men in
such diverse lines of business when
ih<"re were so many well-known and re
llahle firms in that line of industry. He
calmly called attention to the deadly pre
cedent that had been established last
year, and supplemented the statement
with the remark that he knew he was
getting good work.
"I am sorry," said he. "that such mat
ters have come up, for they are uncalled
for. So far as some of the work I had
planned to do is concerned, the Board of
Health will have to take things in band
and have the work performed or some
of the schools will necessarily he closed.
For instance, at the Irving School the
sewer that leads from the vaults is
broken, and the seepage is flowing out in
sufficient quantity to cause an epidemic.
In the Webster School the principal told
me that there had been no whitening or
Inside painting done there for eighteen
years, and one only needs to look at it
to believe the statement. I have been
conducting the affairs of the committee
as 1 would my own business, and I have
ordered nothing that was not required.
Of course I did not know that Conklin's
partner was a grocer, but I knew that
Conklin was a carpet-beater. My reason
for giving him the work was that he did
work for the board last year and it was j
entirely satisfactory. 1 can't be expected ]
to know every member of a firm I may
deal with and I do not know Conklin's j
reasons for taking Donohue into the con- i
tracts. Just the same, my work will I
bear the closest investigation. If the
board does not want to follow my sug
gestions as to needed improvements that
is their affair and I am not responsible.
It is very unpleasant to have matters
come up in this way when I am conscious
of having done no wrong. So far as Mr.
Gallagher's motives are concerned in
causing this scandal, he can explain them
in his own way. I have nothing to say."
"How about Director Drucker's change
of heart and his charge that you were
making a tool of him?" was asked.
"Well," said Mr. Burns, smilingly, as
he involuntarily kicked a fruit box, "he
had no call to do it. but I guess he
thought that would be the best possible
way to begin doing a litue preliminary
politics on his own hook. Maybe he con
cluded I was in his way and that would
be a popular move for him to make. Pos
sibly it was. Time will tell."
$500, well knowing that anything larger
would have no chance of being accepted
at Washington. The local treasurer has
been very careful to see tnat all of the
subscribers have been genuine, that is,
that no one person has been buying up
the smaller bonds under a number of
names. In order to secure more than con
templated by the Government when mak
ing this a "popular loan." So far as he
can learn the speculators have been kept
out of the field.

ury.

OBJECTS TO RETIRING.
Lieutenant Colonel Louis T, Morris U. S. A., Whose
Heart Has Caused a Commotion in
Militaru Circles.
MAJOR WHITE
IS SUDDENLY
DISPLACED
No Longer on the Re
tiring Board.
SUCCEEDED BY ISAAC P. WARE
- â¢ - â "
HAS COLONEL MORRIS CAUSED
SOMETHING TO DROPP
Two Interesting Stories About Major
White's Connection With Gen
eral Kierritt's Staff and
the Retiring Board.
Information was received In San Fran
clso from Washington yesterday that
Major R. H. White, United States army
surgeon, had been removed from the re
tiring board and that Captain Isaac P.
Ware, assistant surgeon, had been ap
pointed in his place. This sudden and
unexpected action on the part of the War
Department no doubt will cause some
surprise as well as comment in local mili
tary circles, as the cause of this retire
ment is not generally known.
There is, however, an interesting story
quietly told in connection with this mat
ter. Major White, who was post surgeon
for some time prior to three months ago,
at the Presidio, was appointed assistant
to the chief surgeon of the Philippine ex
peditionary forces on Major General Mer
ritt'B staff, but when Lieutenant Colonel
Henry Lippincott was made chief sur
geon on the staff Major White, for some
reason, raised objection, bo the story
goes, as he did not wish to be subordinate
to Lippincott. Whether his objections
were owing to some personal reasons or
were caused by jealousy is not known to
those not fully conversant with the in
side secrets of the affair, but some few
people are inclined to ascribe his action
to the latter cause. However, the rela
tions between Major White and his su
periors became decidedly strained owing
to his conduct. __
And now. in connection with Major
White's sudden displacement from the re
tiring board, there comes another story,
equally interesting.
One day a few weeks ago Lieutenant
Colonel Louis T. Morris, commandant of
the Presidio, received a telegram from
â¢the War Department, notifying him to
appear before the retiring board. It was
as much a surprise to him as if one of
the ornamental shells along the Presidio
walks had exploded in front of him.
In due time the retiring board met, and
its sessions were decidedly warm at
times, being made so by the redhot shots
tired at Major White by Lieutenant Col
onel Morris, who believed that the sum
mons to appear for examination had been
instigated by White.
It is said that for a long time anything
but a friendly feeling has existed be
tween these two officers. It seems that
the heart of Lieutenant Colonel Morris is
not a perfect heart, although it is in the
right place, and very large. Physically
he has a defective heart, and he has
known it for years. It was probably
feared by Surgeon White that Morris
might drop dead on the field of battle.
Morris however, insisted that he might
as well fall dead there as anywhere else,
and that, in fact, he preferred to fall on
the held of battle rather than be lgno
mlnicusly pushed out of the service, so
long as he was entitled to remain. Lieu
tenant Colonel Morris did not hesitate to
boldly intimate that he was being made
the victim of some underhanded clique,
and he made pertinent inquiries of the
board, with a view of getting at the bot
tom of the mysterious affair, but without
gaining his object. His language was not
at all times clothed in the mildest terms,
but to show that he was not at all afraid
of the results he requested that all that
he said should be taken down in writing,
which was done. Colonel Morris not only
scored Major White before the board, but
has continued to do so at every oppor
tunity ever since its adjournment.
Meantime he has been acting on the de
fensive. He has laid the matter before
the proper authorities at Washington, and
has enlisted the influence of several prom
inent men in his behalf. The decision of
the board is still hanging fire. It may be
not at all improbable that Lieutenant
Colonel Morris has caused something to
drop. He is too gallant a. veteran to be
politely booted into retirement, and too
pugnacious to allow It without making a
most vigorous fight against it. He will not
reach the retiring age until 1904. He serv
ed throughout the Civil War, beginning
his active military career as a first lieu
tenant of the Nineteenth Infantry, and
rising to the rank of captain. He was
several times brevetted for gallant and
meritorious services on the field of battle
in the Atlanta campaign and during the
battle of Nashville. His highest brevet
rank was major. He was in the fipld with
the Army of the West, and participated
in the campaigns of ISG3-C4, and fought in
the battles of Hoover's Gap. McElmore's,
Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, Buzzard
Roost, Dalton, Resaca, New Hope Chuch
Peach Tree Creek, Atlanta, Columbia,
Franklin and Nashville, and after the war
he served on the frontier against the
Cheyennes and Kiowas.

REAL VALUE
MUST APPEAR
Deeds, Etc., Not Valid
Unless True.
NOT WORTH THE RECORDING
STAMPS MUST BE AFFIXED FOB
THE FULL TAX.
Consideration Paid and Received for
the Property Must Be Truth
fully Stated in the
Papers.
Deeds, conveyances and other docu
ments relating to the transfer of real
estate are not worth the paper they are
written on unless the stamps required by
the war revenue act are affixed. Such is
the opinion of competent lawyers who
have looked into the matter, and they are
advising their clients not to neglect af
fixing the stamps and to state in such pa
pers the real consideration involved in the
transaction.
The only thing like an official opinion
that has yet been given in the matter is
an informal one by United States Attor
ney Henry S. Foote. It was in reply to a
query by C. P. Owen, Recorder of Santa
Clara County. Mr. Owen wired to Judge
Foote the following: "Consideration in a
deed $10; known value of property $5000.
Parties refuse to pay tax on value, claim
ing the law says 'consideration.' What
shall 1 doâ refuse the document?"
Judge Foote replied by letter to the ef
fect that he was not authorized in his
official capacity to give opinions to other
than Federal officials, but he would say
unofficially, without hesitation, that the
amount of the stump to be afiixod on the
deed must be the real "consideration or
value" of the property conveyed, on the
basis of the law under the head of con
veyance. "As a matter of course, per
sons cannot convey property by putting
in a nominal consideration instead of the
real consideration or value," adds the
Judge. "1 cannot be your adviser as to
refusing the document or otherwise."
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch said:
"Under the war revenue act a man has no
more right to understate the value of the
property in a deed than he would have to
give a wrong statement as to proof
spirits. In all cases of violations of rev
enue the United States interprets the law
in its own favor. In other words, it gives
itself the benefit of the doubt."
A. M. Speck, real estate dealer, said that
not much complaint had been made by
clients on account of the stamp tax on
deeds, rent receipts and other documents
involving real estate. The owners of the
property furnish the stamps, except in
the case of leases, the stamps for which
are furnished half and half by the parties.
With regard to the custom of placing a
fictitious consideration in deeds. Air.
Speck said that he had been advised by
his attorney that such a proceeding ren
dered the deeds of no more account than
so much waste paper. He added that if a
litigant couW prove that the deed the
validity of which he might be contesting
was stamped at less than the tax on the
actual consideration he could have it
thrown out of court.
Section 6 of the act provides the penal
ties for a violation of the law, and is as
follows:
That if any person or persons shall make,
sign or Issue, or cause to be made, signed or
Issued, any instrument, document or paper of
any kind or description whatsoever, without
the same being dulystamped fordenotingthe tax
hereby imposed thereon, or without having there
upon "an adhesive stamp to denote said tax,
such person or persons shall be deemed guilty
of misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof
shall pay a fine of not more than JIOO. at the
discretion of the court, and such Instrument,
document or paper, as aforesaid, shall not be
competent evidence in any court.
Section 15 makes It unlawful to record
or register any document subject to the
tax without having been, properly
stamped. _ .
In schedule A It Is provided that
Conveyance, deed. Instrument or writing,
whereby any lands, tenements or other realty
gold shall be granted, assigned, transferred or
otherwise conveyed to or vested ir the pur
chaser or purchasers or any other person or
persons, by his, her or their direction, when
the consideration of value exceeds $100 and
doea not exceed $500, 50 cents, and for each
additional $500 or fractional part thereof in ex
cess of $500, 50 cents.
The Recorder said that he could find
nothing in the law to apply to him as
Recorder. The law deals with the par
ties between whom the deal is made, and
says the deed shall be rejected in court
if offered in evidence in any proceedings.
So far as the Recorder is concerned he
will record any and all deeds presented
to him. The law makes no mention of his
rejection of any document presented to
him for record.
There is no penalty attached to him
for making a record of any deed of con
veyance of real estate without a stamp
being on the document.
