APPOINTMENTS THAT WERE
A " DISGRACE AND SHAME "
Gage Hurries His Inauguration in Order to
Keep Gunst in Office.
Burns and His Police Commissioner, About Whom the New
Governor Is So Solicitous, Denounced in a Public
Meeting Four Years Ago. :-.' :
PEOPLE'S PROTEST AGAINST GUNST.
Resolved, That while we con
sider this last appointment (Gunst's)
no worse than the first (Burns'), we
do feel that such appointments of
the representatives of the immoral
elements to the control of the FÂ»o-
lice Department of this city are a
burning shame and an everlasting
disgrace to the decent and respect
able portion of the community.
Extract from resolutions unanimously
adopted at a mass-meeting of citizens
held at the Metropolitan Temple, Janu
ary 12, ie<?s.
Daniel M. Burns want? Mose Gunst
to continue in office as Police Commis
sioner.
Daniel M. Burns "has been very
kind" to Governor-elect Gage.
Thf> people "f San Francisco in .nass
meeting assembled denounced the ao
tment of Cunn as Police Commis
sloner.
The people of San Francisco rolled ur>
a hip majority for Gage on the strength
of hi? ante-election pledges.
The "peculiar" kindness of Burns has
\vr!g!it WTCT! the new executive
than the desires of the entire resoect
ahle element of the greatest city In the
commonwealth.
â .-.-â¢rnor-elect Gage is so desirous of
paying his personal obligations to
Burns that hÂ» sent the following mes
sage to Governor Budd:
"Colonel Hums has been very kind
try me. and I feel that I am under ob
ligations to him. He wants Gunst to
continue in office, and now that I am
In a position to '.-andle this matter for
him I feel that I ought to do it. I am
in no hurry to be inaugurated, and
would prefer to let matters take their
usuai course, l>ut if it becomes neces-
I can l>e inaugurated in time to
lv, idle this Unless I get
the proper assurances I feel that I
ought to take such a course as will
lit any mistakes."
Possibly Mr. Gage does not know
that the original appointment of this
man Gunst, about whose retention in
office he is so solicitous, almost brought
cbout a revival of the old vigilance
committee days.
There was probably never a more
startling announcement than that
which told th" i !â !â¢â  that liose Gunst
had been appointed Police Commission
er for San Francisco by Governor
Mark ham. The idea was so preuoster
ous that the people laughed at the
joke. But they found that it was not
Markham'p day for jokin~. and then
the wave of indignation which b
over the city an<l State was bo strong
that any man but Muse Gunst would
have been giad to hide his shame under
a cloak of resignation.
Burns had also been "kind" to Gov
ernor Markham, and Gunst was his
pay.
The general sentiment of the people
at the time of the appointment of
Gunst was fully expressed in the terse
sentence of Postmaster Frank McCop
pln: "The whole thing is an infamous
outrage and an insult to the whole peo
ple."
And Gage wants to renew the out
rage and insult, because Burns "has
been very kind" to him.
Mr. Gag* was a resident of the State
that time, and he surely has not for
â¢ n that immediately upon the an
â  vment of the appointment of
two ommittees, representing
elen ents of the city, the

ill a public meeting to protest
the "outrage of the appoint

be refreshed regarding The man about
whose appointment he is so solicitous,

significant remark: "I believe the
appointment one of the worst that
could have been made."
But the people assembled there In :
their indignation did something more !
than talk. They passed a resolution i
which would have laid bare the palpi- j
tating: flesh of anything but a
pachyderm, and then sent a committee
to wait on Gunst and ask him to re
sign.
But Gunst was not thin-skinned. He
was "insulted." -......â  ..
When 10.000 of his fellow-citizens I
unanimously passed the following reso- l
lution he was "insulted":
"Resolved, That while we consider
this last appointment (Gunst's) no ;
worse that the first (Burns'), we do i
. feel that such appointments of the rep- j
j resentatives of the immoral elements to i
! the control of the Police Department of j
this city are a burning shame and an i
\ everlasting disgrace to the decent and :
respectable portion of the community." i
What the people felt then they feel
now and while their protests were of
no avail their resentment of the dis
grace burns as strongly to-day as it
did four years ago, an<" when Mr. Gage
fo far foreets the kindness of the peo
ple of San Francisco, when they
changed a Democratic majority of 12.000
to a Republican majoriv of 4000 on the
belief in his ante-election pledges, as

are of such a peculiar nature as to

The appointment of such a man as

obligation to such a man as Burns is.
of itself, a disgrace to the State which
has honored Gage by calling him to
the gubernatorial chair, but when that j
appointment was made with a full i
knowledge of the protests of the peo- j
pie, not only of San Francisco, hut of
the whole State, insult is added to the
injury, and if the future is to be
Judged by the past Governor Gage will
have to be clothed in a hide as thick

missioner to escape the sting of the
people's contempt.
Thf-re is a moral, too, for the people
of the State in this that is beyond the
matter of the appointment of a Police
Commissioner for the city of San Fran
cisco. If the appointment of Daniel
M. Burns as Police Commissioner for ;
San Francisco was. as stated In that
resolution passed by thousands of citi
zens, "a burning shame and everlast
ing disgrace to the decent and respect
able portion of the community." what
will his election by the State Legisla
ture to the office of United States Sen
ator mean to the great commonwealth
of California?
Can the people of the State bear the
6tigma of being represented by a man
so openly denounced by the decent ele
ment of the community?

MRS. CORDELIA BOTKIN IS GUILTY
OF THE CRUEL DELAWARE MURDERS
Jury Fixes Penalty for the Heinous Crime at Imprisonment for the Term of the Inhuman
Perpetrator's Natural Life- â The Condemned Woman Receives the Verdict
With Tearless Eyes and Unnatural Composure.
Her Attorneys Affirm That the Verdict Is Not in Keeping With Either the Law or the Evidence Submitted by the
Prosecution in This Case, Which Has Attracted the Attention of the Whole World Owing to the Vicionsness
of the Methods Employed by This Modern Borgiaâ Sentence Will Be Pronounced
on the Seventh Day of January.
Â«
We find the defendant,
Cordelia Botkin. guilty of
murder in the first degree,
and fix her punishment at im
prisonment for the term of her
natural life.
WITH these words a Jury
fastened upon Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin yesterday one of the
most cruel crimes of the cen
tury â the murder of Mrs.
John P. Dunning and Mrs. Joshua
Deane at Dover, Del., on the night of
August 9. This modern Borgia sent
through the mails a box of chocolate
bonbons, the contents of which were
heavily charged with arsenic. The
prosecution weaved a remarkable web
of circumstantial evidence about the
woman upon whom suspicion was first
directed and she was convicted last
night. As a motive for the crime they
showed her infatuation for John P.
Dunning, the husband of one of the
unfortunate victims.
Her manner when the verdict was an
nounced was in keeping with her ac
tions from the start. There was no sob
â no piteous moan as of a heart and
spirit crushed by the enormity of the
crime thus brought home to her. The
leaning which she has toward the melo
dramatic was with her to the end. As
Oscar Tolle read the verdict of the jury
with all Its dreadful Import she
watched him as though transfixed and
as immovable as stone. When the jury
was being polled she bent a look of
supreme disdain upon the men who h'Â±<l
weighed the evidence against her and
had said "thou art the woman."
At fourteen minutes past nine the
courtroom bell which is connected with
the Jury-room, rang out sharp and clear.
There was a peremptory tone to its
ring and those experienced in the ways
of Juries at once said it meant a verdict
had been decided upon and that it was
not likely to be favorable to Mrs. Bot
kin. A moment before those in the
courtroom stood about In little groups
discussing the possibility of the jury
being out all night. This seemed likely
as valises full of clothes were being
brought In from time to time.
At the premonitory signal from the
bell a hush fell upon those in the room.
Mrs. Botkin fidgeted about in her chair
and apparently could find no comfort
able attitude. Her hand went to her
head and she fingered nervously at her
mouth. Attorneys Knight and Mc-
Gowan were in their accustomed places,
as were her sisters, Mrs. McClure and
Mrs. Robarts, and their husbands.
The silence was oppressive. It was
some minutes before the door opened
and the jury filed In. The relatives
and supporters of the woman accused
sat with their backs toward the door
and gave no token of their knowledge
that the men were coming in. Those
who could see the faces of the jurymen
knew at once what the verdict was at
which they had arrived. There was a
set expression which told of an un
pleasant duty performed in keeping
with the trust and responsibility re
posed in them. They were asked if
they had arrived at a verdict and Fore
man Kennedy arose and said they had.
He handed a slip of paper to Clerk
Tolle, who in turn passed it to Judsre
Cook. He read It to himself and then
ordered it read aloud.
The word 6of such terrible import
were spoken and nothing broke the
stillness save the order of the Judsre
that it be recorded. This required
some moments and no one in the court
room stirred. Attorney Knight looked
neither to the right nor the left. Mrs.
Botkin cast one long look at the jury
and then gazed at the desk before her.
Her slaters were struck dumb and
could utter no words of sympathy or
cheer to the condemned woman. The
prisoner's face was sphinx-like and be
trayed no emotion, no feeling. The
room was cleared. No one seemed
brave enough to break in uuon Mrs.
Botkin and disturb her thoughts, what
ever they may have been. She sat per
fectly unright with her hands on the
table opening and shutting as though
clutching at something unseen by hu
man eyes. She fanned herself automat
ically and suddenly went off into a
faint. But this was but momentarily,
and she was soon herself again.
Her attorneys consoled her with the
statement that the verdict was not in
keeping with the law or the evidence.
! and they hinted at groat pressure hav
i ing been brought to bear on the iury
through the public sentiment that had
been aroused by the miscarriage of
justice in the Rosser and other cases
lately.
George H. Knight was the most dis
appointed person in the courtroom (not
even excepting the prisoner herself)
when the decision was handed in. Im
mediately after the verdict he wae
asked to express his opinion about it,
and said:
"Well, all I have to say is that it is
against the law and against the evi
dence."
When asked if he expected it he re
plied emphatically that he did not, al
though later on he was heard to say,
with an assurance that was no doubt
assumed, that he rather looked for it;
but he would not give the reason for his
change of sentiment.
"There have been errors of law made
in this case." he continued, "and on
that we will base our appeal for a new
trial."
When asked for a particular instance
of th^tee errors he said: "The Judge
erred when he did not state in his
charge, as I requested him to do, that
there was absolutely and positively no
evidence that Mrs. Botkin had pur
chased any lump arsenic in the Owl
drug store."
The attorney then abused one of the
jurors. "Why, this juryman," he said,
"owes a large amount of money to
members of the police force, but I will
not say any more, and I have advised
my client to keep a discreet silence."
Knight assumed a general air of in
different levity throughout his con
versation on the subject, but it was ap
parent he did not express his real feel
ings at the verdict.
If the jury came in for criticism from
Mr. Knight he in turn was criticized by
them. As they were leaving the room
after being dismissed one of them re
marked, "This will teach George
Knight that he cannot bulldoze wit
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
nesses with impunity when trying v
case before a Jury of business men. If
it teaches him and men of his kind that
those tactics are not the proper ones to
employ, the lesson will not have i>een
wasted."
When Mrs. Botkin was ready for the
road her sisters asked as a favor that
they be allowed to accompany her on
the journey to the Branch Jail at In
glefide. This boon was readjly granted
by Sheriff Whelan. When the time
came to move Mrs. Botkin had recov
ered her wonted composure and gave no
outward sign of the emotions within
her. She gathered her skirts about her
and with the grand air which had be
come a habit with her she said. "I'm
ready." With her little escort she left
the room and made her way out of the
building by the exit near the Hall of
Records. From here they went to Mar
ket street and thence down Seventh to
the Mission-street cars. She walked
between a Deputy Sheriff, who has
been her custodian from the first, and
Brother-in-law Robarts. Some of the
loungers on the street corners recog
nized her as she passed, but to the ma
jority she was but an ordinary person
age.
The greater portion of the day was
given over to the closing argument of
Mr. Hoemer. At its conclusion a re
cess of ten minutes was taken before
Judge Cook commenced to deliver his
to the ji'ry. The hum of "r.n
versation commenced immediately and
was not hushed until the jurymen com-
menced to file back to their seats. For
the second time during the trial Mrs.
Botkin removed her veil.
The great strain to which her over
strung nerves had been subjected dur
ing the long day showed In her face,
and she looked her two-score years.
The charge, which Judge Cook read
from manuscript, required a"n hour in
Its presentation. The woman's attor
neys knew that portions of it decided
certain disputed points in the testimony
favorable to her and they were confi
dent, or affected an air of confidence,
in the outcome of the jury's delibera
tions.
Not so Mrs. Botkin. Her face as
sumed an ashen pallor and her Hds
twitched almost continuously.
She could not cry. although there was
at all times a suspicion of moisture in
her eyes. For a time she watched the
I Judge and then bent a steady gaze on
! the Jurymen, as though to learn from
j their faces what the fates had In store
' for her. The solemnity of the closing
j words of the charge did not seem to
'â  strike home to her heart. A3 the Jury
: men left the courtroom to commence
their deliberations Mrs. Botkin leaned
her head on the back of her chair and
I her Ups moved as If in prayer. The
j pallor on her features, which seemed
I swollen, increased and for a time it
1 seemed as if she would faint..
Her faithful sister came to her relief
: and in a moment she stood up and
moved about in a sprightly manner.
At the suggestion of the Sheriff she
I was taken to his office, where she and
her relatives could commune in privacy.
The charge of Judge Carroll Cook
was an important one. If there was
any leaning, the tendency was toward
I the woman on trial for her life. In
opening the Judge congratulated the
1 jurymen that their duties would soon
J^eud and thanked, them for their atten2
tlon during the trial. He said in or
der thai their verdict should be in ac
cordance with the law and the testi
mony they must understand the prin
ciples of the law. It was for the pur
pose of Instructing them in this regard
thai he addressed them at that time.
H< said any error of his would be re
viewed by the Supreme Court.
With Questions of fact and height of
testimony the court had nothing to do;
those were matters for them to deter
mine. He warned them not to con-
Bider any evidence that had been
stricken out. They must not consider
tht argument, comment or suggestion.
of counsel as evidence. He then read
the suggestions made by the defend
ant's counsel to be incorporated in the
charge.
He told thfin that if any witness hnd
sword falsely they must discard all the
testimony of thai witness as not worthy
dence. He dwelt on the fact of
the burden of proof resting on the peo
ple, and that their case must be proved
a reasonable doubt. if two
codld be placed on any
<'ne of innocence, the other
of quill they must place upon it the
itruction of innocence. It was the
duty .if the prosecution to overcome all
t innocence.
Th.- â  '.]>'.' nee of the experts should be
received with great caution. It is ad
misslble In i ertain cases and is entitled
to fie considered. He urged them to
form an opinion of ihrir own after per
sonal examination. In the considera
tion of tli> case they were not to be
: tlment, sympathy, pas
sion nor prÂ« jr..
As to th - letter post
marked In this city when Mrs. Botkin
was in Eureka, he said the presump
tion undei was that the latter
had been d< i ti d here and that such
presumption cannot be overcome unless
by evidence to the contrary. They can
not act on surmise or suspicion.
The first thing they were to ascer
tain beyond a reasonable doubt was
whether the deaths of the two women
brought about by arsenical pois
oning. This must be determined be
yond reasonable doubt, either by the
result of the autopsy or by other com
petent evidence. This must be done to
a moral certainty. If there is any
doubt as t'Â« the cause' the defendant
must be a< quitti <l.
They must not take into considera
tion her personal relations with Dun
ning, and if the motive was not shown
they must consider It In making their
verdict. If certain circumstances c*>uld
be proved either way they carried no
weight and should not be considered.
If the reasonable doubt existed it was
their duty to acquit. They must not
be guided by the preponderance of tes
timony, but must have more convinc
ing reasons.
The court dwelt at length on the mat
ter of reasonable doubt, saying if that
existed they must acquit the defend
ant. Thi; evidence presented them was
not to be weighed In an arbitrary man
ner, but tinder the carefully drawn
laws that govern evidence. The de
fendant was always entitled to the
presumption of innocence, and if the
â  able doubt existed she must be
acquitted. The moral certainty, how
ever, was all that the law reauired.
First it must be proved that a crime
had been '.. and then It must
be proved the defendant did it.
He then quoted the words of Judge
Murphy on the question of motive for
crime and devoted some time to a dis
>n of rlitt t or i sitive evidence.
. instant ial evidence was the basis
of the present trial and if proved was
just as s;ood an direct evidence, as all
ence was more or less circumstan
tial. If the circumstantial evidence
was proved they must find her guilty.
In dosing Judge Cook counseled them
that the enforcement of law was the
uard of society. That they had
a duty to perform both to the defendant
and to the public. He asked them not
to be swayed by sentiment, but t<> ba
faithful and just.
When the jury retired to deliberate
Mrs. Botkin went from the courtroom
to the otllce of Sheriff Whelan. She
was accompanied by her relatives and
seemed unconcerned over her fate. She
made herself comfortable near the fire
and after a discussion of the events of
the day asked for some coffee and.
toast. While she was disposing of this
her sisters went to a nearby restaurant
for dinner.
Long before 7:30 they were ready to
return to the court room. The crowd
gathered slowly. Apparently few knew
tlv cas>- had gone to the jury.
Mrs. Hotkin was by far the most un
concerned member of her little party.
She chatted prayly with Rmther-in-Law
Robarts, and toother they discussed
the contents of the evning napers. She
did not shield her face with the heavy
black veil that in the past had con
cealed the play of her features. The
harsh light from the huge chandelier
suspended above her head brought all
the lines of her heavy fac< out in strong
relief. The lines about the mouth have
been accentuated from the ordeal
through which she has gone, and in
truth she has passed her youth, as she
told her husband when she declined to
divorce him.
The wait semed to hang more heavily
on her sisters than on herself. They sat
somewhat apart from her and gazed in
open-mouthed wonder at this remark
able woman who gives no facial hints
that she is of their flesh and blood. The

noises of the courtroom -seemed to dis
concert them, but they had no effect on
her nerves. Later on the sisters put
their heads together and carried on
an animated talk with the Rev. Mr.
McClure, husband of one of the Brown
sisters.
The closing argument for the people
by District Attorney Hosmer was a
brilliant effort. This was not from a
rhetorical or an oratorical point of
j view, but for its masterful analysis of
the testimony presented in thiÃ case.
It was cruel, pitiless, in the scattering
1 to the four winds the defense presented
by Mrs. Botkin. It was all such cold,
'hard reasoning that there was no es
| caping the conclusions arrived at by
i this master analylst. Take the letter
admitted to have been written to Gov
ernor Budd by Mrs. Botkin requesting
the appointment as a nurse in the
army.
Mr. Knight thundered away at this
i and explained to the jury that his
I client could not possibly have written
it with Jack Dunning In her mind, as
if she secured the appointment the
only place Governor Budd could send
her to would be Manila. This all
sounded very good and reasonable until
Mr. Hosmer dissected it. He found it
\ dated early in April of this year. Boon
.after Dunning had left this city. He
then pointed out tnat the srallant
Dewey had not made Manila a place
1 open to Americans until May Ist. All
; Knight's eloquence could not contro
: vert that cold. fact.
He told some wholesome truths re
garding the bad taste displayed by the
' defense In the intimidation of wit
nesses. This he claimed was not for
t the purpose of contradicting the wit
nesses but to hold them up to
.scorn and ridicule. It showed the des
perate straits to- which the defense
was put, especially as. they were
i unable to show any witnessess un
worthy of belief. His slow, measured
dramatic words had their effect
on the followers of Mrs. Botkin. "When
he laid bare her life in this city, away
from her husband, he talked plainly.
He spoke of her life with Dunning as
.degraded, dissipated, licentious.
Mr. Hosmer was honored with the
largest attendance o-f the trial. He was
prepared for a great effort and outdid
all his previous efforts, and as some
j one remarked, proved that he was, as
; has been claimed, "the brains of the
District Attorney's office for the past
ten years." The courtroom was filled
with ladies. He held the attention of ;
his auditors from the start, as he had
a thrilling story of crime to tell them, j
He questioned the good taste of the j
attorneys for Mrs. Botkin in coming be- !
fore the jury and pleading that they j
were serving without hope of compen- {
sation. They could not urge that as a j
defense for their client. He asked that
they try her as a man. without fear,
favor or affection. He then described ,
the terrible crime by which two Inno
cent women were murdered without ad- j
monition or warning that they had an j
enemy in all the world.
He showed where counsel for the de
fendanf were at variance In their rea
soning on the case. He scoffed at the
contention that the box of candy had
never gone through the mail, claiming
that it had been proven absolutely. He
pictured the scene on the porch of the
Pennington homestead, when the candy
was brought from the postoffice, and
the little group tried to decipher from
whom had come the box and its loving
note and dainty handkerchief.
He likened the person who sent the
poisoned candy to a snake, but said
the latter gave warning when It was
about to strike. He said he expected
to prove the poisoning to have been
done to gratify the lust of a designing
woman. She stole the livery of heaven
to serve the devil. She took this moth
er out of this life not for hatred but
to satisfy a lust that could not other
wist be satisfied.
He said witnesses on the stand were
entitled to as much consideration as
: they were accorded upon the street.
They should be free from insult and
intimidation which was never used to
effect any good or wholesome ends. In
' suit and innuendo do not prove that a
man uttered a falsehood on the stand.
He cited questions asked witnesses that
were Intended to give a wrong impres
sion to the jury, and went down the
list of witnesses that Knight had baited
upon the stand. These included the
majority of the witnesses for the prose
cution.
He traced the probable development.
icf the plot to , kill this woman and
) shewed how a little. at a time would bo
I accomplished. That the person wiro
Vanned so frightful a crime would have
many struggles with her conscience,
that at times must have been over
. whelming.
For the motive he traced the rela
tions existing between Mrs. Botkin and
Dunning from the first day they met in
Golden Gate Park. From her testimony
she made Dunning appear to be a waif,
neglected by the world and taken under
her wins for protection. She told all
the good she had done, but hesitated at
the evil. When she told of the bracers
of whisky we get a glimpse of the char
acter of a woman who is not virtuous.
Dunning told of their life and showed
that it was one of degradation, dissipa
tion, licentiousness; a story of the race
track, back doors of saloons and every
thing that would make up total de
pravity.
The only conclusion we can draw
from all her testimony is that she was
not acting: the Rood Samaritan, but was
actuated by a mad infatuation for this j
man. Why should she be giving out the j
money she received frÂ«~m Botkln unless j
shf was infatuated with Dunnlne. i
Dunning tells us all these thinps which i
tend to show her feelings toward him,
and Mrs. Simpson fold of her breaking ;
down at Oakland when she finally said
good-by to this man.
Her statement^ to Mrs. Ruoff and |
Miss Livernash later on show what her
sentiments were toward this man.
Dunning has made no secret of the life j
they led while in this city. When he j
returned from the war he found his |
wife dead, and when the cover of the
box and other documents were lftid be
fore him they told with unerring ac
curacy the identity of the sender.
Mr. Hosmer asked, "Do you suppose
Dunning would come across the con- j
tinent and would open his lips and lay
bare his past life as he has done if he ;
did not consider her guilty? Remember
the obligations he uas under to Mrs. :
Botkin, and you can appreciate the fact !
that under no other conditions would
he tell than those in -which he found
himself. He knew that she was the i
actor in this diabolical plot.
"Mrs. Botkin was willing that her ,
husband should have the pleasures of
life, but was not willing to grant him a
divorce. This is reasonable because she
wants the support which he has ac
corded her. Both of them are adulter
ers and both are so knowingly. She
comes on the stand and tells you that
she has been a good and dutiful wife,
but she has imposed on you in this
respect."
Mr. Hosmer said that the anonymous j
letters tell nf all their relations arid
who would know of them but this wo

man. In the June 18 letter, which
was mailed here when Mrs. Botkin was
In Eureka, she uses such statements
"as financial difficulties," "race track
speculation," "both given to drinK,"
"forfeited all rights to you," "has left
the city and is divorced from her hus
band."
These are all facts only within the
Knowledge of Mrs. Botkin. This is
particularly so of the expression re
garding the divorce, as she told Dun
ning that her husband had secured a
divorce from her in San Joaauin Coun
ty and that Dunning was the co-re
spondent. According to her own testi
mony Botkin led her to believe she was
free, and who else ever knew this.
Mr. Hosmer said it was possible that
the letter postmarked this city when
Mrs. Botkin was in Eureka could have
been sent here under cover to be re
uiailed. At this Mrs. Botkin and her
counsel laughed heartily.
Mr. Knight broke In with: "Do you
claim it was sent under cover? It was
not proven.." He then objected to Mr.
.Hosmer using any such illustration be
fore the jury.
At the opening of the afternoon
| session both Knight and McGowan
j were late. The latter appeared some
seven minutes after 2, but it was an
hour later when Mrs. Botkin's senior
j counsel put in an appearance.
Mr. Hosmer took up his analysis of
â¢the annoymous letters. He showed that
| in another of Mrs. Botkin's letters the
â date and the post mark did not aeree.
This was the letter of July 10. and
bears the postmark of July 9. He
quoted the "quiet Bohemian life." a
sentence Mrs. Ruoff said Mrs. Botkin
often used.
Mr. Hosmer. claimed that the motive
for the crime was that her relation
i with Dunning be changed from that of
! mistress to one of wife. She sees him
! in a new light other than that of op i.
; licentiousness in this city. He had
gained fame as a war correspondent,
and she wanted to share â to go and be
; his consort In New York. She would
I even remove Mrs. Dunning from the
â face of the earth, arid by her death get
her husband. ' '
The plan to incite her to divorce had
! failed, and now she- wanted to wipe
wife and child put of existence. There
was the motive for the act, and that
was what prompted the action that ter
: minatedso fa.tefully.
He spoke of the gravity of the offense
; that caused the death of those women,
| that it was cowardly and premeditated.
! He said the gallows was the proper
| end for such a person and asked the
jurors to do their duty to themselves
[and to the community in which they
; lived.
Judge Cook will pronounce sentenre
i upon the condemned woman next Sat
i urday.
Now that. Mrs. Botkin haa suffered a
conviction at the hands of. the jury that
tried her, the petition of W. L. Har
per, recently filed to determine the ju
risdiction of the Superior Court to try
the accused, will, according to Attor
ney Louis Boardman; who represented
Harper, be taken up and the Jurisdic
tion of the court finally determined.
This being the case a formal apoeal
from the judgment of the Superior
Court will not reach, the Supreme Court
until after the matter of jurisdiction
has been determined, and if it is found
that the trial court had no jurisdiction
the, efforts of the people to punish the
condemned murderess will have gone
for naught.
BIGGY HAS CUT
ELECTION EXPENSES
COMPARISON OF COST OF THE
OFFICE FOR TWO YEARS.
Systematic Shaving of Items Which
Leaves a Surplus in the
Registrar's Hands.
Registrar Biggy has .iust issued a state
ment showing- the expenses of his office
| since the beginning of. the last fiscal year,
with an estimate of expenses until Its
close, oh June 30, 1599. He also makes
a comparison of the expenses incurred by
him and those of his predecessor, William
M. Hinton. According to the statement
the office can be run much cheaper than
Hinton succeeded in running it.
Hinton's office expenses tor 1896-97 were
$6600, the amount fixed by law. The ex
penses of the Presidential election, hold
November 3, ISW, were $195,556 7S. Adding
the $6600 for office expenses; a total is
i found of $202,156 78 for the year.
Biggy has Bhaved this down apprecia
] bly. His office expenses, ll.ke those of Mr.
Hinton, will be $6600. and he was granted
an appropriation of $149,500 for the general
election held November 8. Instead of run
ning over the appropriation, as has fre
quently been done, he got through the
election on $146,613 93. leaving a balance
of $2886 07. "With his office expenses added
to those of the election the total expanse
of Tunning th>- office for the year Will be
$153,213 93. against $202,156 78 for onÂ« year
of Hinton's administration.
The figures of the Freeholders' election
duringHlnton'sterm, compared with those
of the charter election in Biggy's, also
make an interesting comparison. It cost
Hinton $15,151 91 for the freeholders' elec
tion on December 27. 1897., while ac char
ter election on May 2fi, IS9B, was engi
neered by Blggy for $12,181 66. The differ
ence is chiefly in minor items. â¢
SAVED FROM DECAPITATION.
Three Men Rescue Arthur Simmons
From a Fearful Fate in an
Elevator.
Had it not been for the presence of
mind of Manager Gibson of the Grant
Pharmacy in the Parrott building and
Messrs, Pearce and Simms. Arthur Sim
mons, a boy of 14. would have been de
capitated by the elevator. At noon the
boy, who is employed .in the pharm.iey.
was given the afternoon off and started
for the elevator. He found the door open
and stepped in. Not finding the elevator
boy he waited for him to appear, and
just then the elevator began to descend
slowly. After it had gone four or fivj
feet he became frightened and attempted
to ge.t out. The trip of the cage caught
htm in the back and he called for help.
Gibson and. Pearce ran to his assistance
and caught hold of the elevator. tliu;Â»
holding its weight off and preventing It
from crushing him : . Dr. Simms heard the
cries and came out with a scantling,
which he used (is a lever, and held the
elevator up until the' power could be re
versed.
The boy had in the meantime worked
himself, out with the exception of his
head, and the use of the scantling 1 saved
him from decapitation. He- was removed
to the residence of his uncle, W. B. Sim
mons, and it was found that his collar
bone whs dislocated and his kneecap in
jured. The full extent of his injuries has
not yet been ascertained, but he is rest

ORPHEUM EMPLOYES DISMISSED
Ed Lewis and Moses Engle Caught
Defrauding the House.
Ed L,pwls. the ticket-seller, and Moses
Engle, the door-keeper,, of the Orpheum,
were discharged yesterday for dishonest
practices in the manipulation of their of
fices. Both combined to secure a little
extra money on the side.
The way in which they operated their
scheme, it is said, is as follows: In the
sale of matinee tickets coupons .were used
and they were torn from a roll which ran
from No. 1 to 100.009. As these tickets
were sold In advance of the show to
av.oid the rush in the box-office, the only
accounting that was made was taken
from the. tickets depositeS in the box at
the door. Lewis would hold out a number
of tickets cut off some weeks previous
sell them, and Engle. on their presenta
tion at the door, would hold them out.
Their practices were discovered at the
Wednesday matinee, when Paul. Butler,
the special policeman of. the Orpheum'
discovered Engle secreting some of the
old tickets in nls pockets. The two em
ployes were promptly discharged.

The Doings of a Bad Man From Texas
Causes the Bloodiest Tragedy in
the* History of Clatsop
County.
Special Dispatch tp The Call.
PORTLAND, Dec. 30.â The burning
of the Fulton cottage at Seaside last
Wednesday morning culminated this
afternoon in the bloodiest tragedy in
the history of Clatsop County, as a
result of which three men are cold in
death and one other is badly wounded.
The dead are:
SHERIFF J. W. WILLIAMS. '
DEPUTY SHERIFF JAMES LA
ME RS.
CHARLES WILLARD.
Deputy Sheriff A. E. Miller was shot
in the leg. It was considered certain
by every one that the burning of the
cottage was for the purpose of con
cealing a robbery, and a suspicion
pointed to Charles Willard as the guilty
person, particularly, as he was seen a
short time after the fire coming: from
the locality with a wheelbarrow load
Acting on the suspicion Sheriff Will
iams this morning secured a search
warrant and, in company with Senator
< '. W. Fulton and others, w;ent to Sea
side to search Willard's premises and
also all the cottages of which he has
charge during the winter season.
About 3 o'clock this afternoon Williams
Fulton and Deputies A. E. Miller and
James Lamera, the two latter being
residents of Seaside, went to the cot
tage of Mrs. Susie Lewiston, where
Willard was living, to search it.
Their rap at the door waÃ answered
by Willard, who on learning what was
wanted, agreed to permit a search of
all the houses. On pretense of being
on the lookout for a beach thief he
picked up hisj rifle and said he would
accompany them. They left the house
and searched the Carlson cottage, and
then Fulton asked Willard to walk
bark to the Lewiston cottage.
It was on near ing the cottage the
second time that the tragedy occurred.
Senator Fulton had identified some
shotgun cartridges in the house as be
longing to him, and began questioning
Willard as to where he got possession
of them. This nettled Willard, although
he answered that a friend had given
them to him, and he began to get ugly.
Fulton and Miller went inside the
cottage, leaving Willard, Sheriff WiU
liams and Lanners standing outside.
! They had lust proceeded to the rear
room when two shots were heard in
quick succession, and on running to the
door Sheriff Williams was seen to
throw up his hands and fall backward
over the bank.
In front of the house were Willard
and LaÂ»ners, in a desperate hand-to
hand struggle, although the latter had
been shot throÂ«gh the right groin and
w;;s fast growing faint, and his assail
ant was fighting with the desperation
of a demon. Fulton sprang at Willard's
head, and pulling him to the ground
jumped on hi-s face. Miller wrenched
the. rifle from his hand, threw it on the
ground and taking out his revolver
beat the desperado on the head.
Senator Fulton in the meantime
picked up the rifle and told Willard to
remain uiet or he would; kill her. The
latter, however, watched his opportun
ity, and jumping to his feet started to
run away, when Fulton fired, missing
him the first time, but striking him in
the face the second time and carrying
ay ay the greater part of his mouth and
Willard fell apparently dead and Ful
ton started to obtain help to care for
the injured men, leaving Miller on
guard with the rifle In hand. Miller
s.teppod back to aid Lamors, who was
lying on the ground desperately wound
ed, When Willard was noticed to be
fumbling with his belt. Quicker than a
flash ho drew a revolver and fired three
bullets, the first one hitting Miller in
th<- l>-ft leg just bolow the hip. Mil
ler returned the fire with the rifle, the
first bullet inflicting a flesh wound in
Wlllard'i shoulder and the second hit
tin? him in the left side near the groin,
killing him instÃntly.
By this time help had arrived, but
Williams and Lamers were beyond all
aid and soon m*A A Coro-ner's Jury
was summoned, and after hearing the
testimony, rendered a verdict in ac
cordance with the facts.
The bodies of the three dead men
were placed on board the train and
brought to this city, those of Sheriff
Williams and Deputy Lamers in cas
kets and that of the desperado wrap
ped in an old sail.
Just how the shooting of Sheriff Will
iams and Deputy Lamers occurred will
never be known, as there are no living
witnesses now, but it is evident thit
they were taken unawares and were
killed with bullets from a revolver, aa
six chambers of Wllldrd's revolver were
empty.
Sheriff Williams was- one of the most
popular men'in the city. He was about
40 years of age, a native of Kentucky
and had beon a resident of Astoria for
abort ten years.
James Lamers was also an unmarried
man. about 3." years of age. He was a
'.â¢arpentor, living at Seaside, and was
deputized by Mr. Williams to aid him
to-day.
Of Charles Willard. the man who
caused the trouble, very little is known.
He came to Seaside from Texas about
seven years ago and had always beer
considered n dangerous character. It
was his habit to carry a rifle and twr
revolvers with him night and day. and
he often remarked that he would novei
be taken alive. He lived by himself Ir
a tent in Grimes drove and earned a
livelihood by looking out for certair
cottages during the winter. It has
been a notable fact for years that near
ly every residence not left in his charge
was either robbed or defaced in some

FILIPINOS
Costly Proclamation Is
Cabled.
THE MILITARY OCCUPATION
IT IS SHOWN NOT TO BE FOB
WAR, BUT PROTECTION.
Major General . Otis Sends News of
the Attitude of Aguinaldo's Crowd
That Causes Uneasiness
At Washington.
Special Dispatch to _ The Call.
NEW YORK; Dec. 30.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: President McKinley's procla
mation setting forth the conditions un
der which the United States takes pos
session of the Philippines has b^en
cabled to General Utis for promulga
tion.
This was done several days ago and
it is assumed that General Otis has
already published it and taken steps
to give it the widest possible circulation
throughout the islands. The proclama
tion is a,bout 2000 words in length and
was cabied to Manila at an expense or"
$1900. It is modeled on the one issued
by General Shafter at Santiago when
this Government took possession of that
city and province, but has been much
amplified.
Home rule under the supreme direc
tion of the United States is by the
terms of the proclamation to be given
the Filipinos in the fullest sense. It
promises that they will be accorded
advice in local government and that
the Filipinos shall be eligible to official
positions. They will be given a fair
judiciary, freedom of speech and of
press.
The proclamation shows that military
occupation of the islands is not for the
purpose of making war on the inhabi- I
tants nor upon any party or faotion I
among them, but to protect them in
their homes in their employments and
in their personal and religious rights.
The manner of treatment of property
ajid the collection and administration
of revenues, in accordance with the
open-door policy set forth in the treaty,
are fully and plainly stated.
While the rule and conduct of the
American officers will be in the line
just indicated, the proclamation also
shows that it is the purpose of the
United States to adopt radical meas
ures if unfortunately the course of the
people should render such measures in
dispensable to the maintenance of law
and order. The instructions accom
panying the proclamation require Gen
eral Otis to take immediate steps to
secure the disarmament of insurgents
in order that peace may be established
and continued in the islands.
Disquieting advices weTe received to
day from Major General Otis, respecting
the attitude of Aguinaldo and his in
surgent forces io the Philippines.
General Otis has not yet been in
formed of the result of the instructions
transmitted by him to the army ex
pedition sent to Jloilo which requires it
to occupy that city notwithstanding its
surrender to the. insurgents. His cable
gram to-day, which was read by Sec
retary Alger at the Cabinet meeting,
stated he was awaiting advices and as
soon as they were received they would
be immediately sent to Washington.
He then went on to describe the atti
tude of the insurgents in Luzon and the
information he gave was not encourag
ing to the officials.
The officials are disinclined to make
public General Otis' dispatch for the
reason .that they fear It will give rise
to apprehension concerning the situa
tion in the Philippines when they feel
confident that the military and naval
arms of the Government are able to
bring the insurgents to terms.
STATEMENT OF THE
FILIPINO JUNTA
HONGKONG, Dec. 30.â The Filipino
junta has replied to the. report of Com
missioner Harden, who was sent to the
Philippines by the Government of the
United States to report on the condi
tions there prevailing. The junta asked
the Associated Press to publish the fol
lowing as revealing "the true situation
and sentiment" in the Philippines:
We deny that Aguinaldo will' be satis
fied If made a major general in the com
mand of live native regiments and that
if th ! s is done the national army could be
disarmed and disbanded.
We repeat our appeal- for ah impartial
inquiry by an able .commissioner and im
plore the American people to retrain from
a hasty decision.
The Filipino Government views with
alarm Commissioner Hardens proposal to
impose In America a high protective tariff
against Philippine products.
â  11-oilo surrendered to the national army
â which is the completion of the occupation
of the Island of Panay. There is no truth
in the reported establishment of an oppo
sition republic in the Vlsayas. All the
officials in the Visayas hold Aguinaldo
commissions.
The Filipinos are yearning for a peace
ful settlement of all questions. To their
brothers arross the sea the Filipinos send
greeting and earnest prayer that with the
new year will come the dawn of a new
era of peace,' prosperity mul gn.nl fellow
ship with the free and henonctnit people
of the United States. Though but an- In
fant among- nÃtions yet we are strong, if
assured of tho good will of the great
American' nation.
INSURGENTS AT ILOILO
INCLINED TO SURRENDER
MANILA, Dec. 30.â The British
cruiser Buena Ventura has prone to
Iloilo to protect British interests there.
The Spanish steamer Romalus. which
hns just arrived here, confirms the re
port that the insurgents, at Iloilo are in
clined to surrender that town to the
Americans if satisfied as to tho form of
government which will be accorded
them.
THE LIE WAS PASSED.
Trouble Between Justice of the Peace
Barry and Attorney Wilscn
Over Blackman's Bond.
The utterly worthless bom} accepted by
Justice of the Peace Barry for the release
of the disgraced policeman. Caseins
Blackman. who has fled, will, probably
lead to some interesting developments.
Captain Seymour is still determined
to take the matter before the next
Grand Jury, and yesterday Judge
Barry and Attorney J. N. E.
Wilson, who represented Blackraan
had a conference with htm. Barry
accused Wilson of misrepresenting things
to him when accepting the bond, and
blamed him for getting him .into trouble.
Wilson denied the charge; and the lie
direct was passed between them. Barry
intimated that he would bring Wilson's
conduct in the matter before the Bar
Association, and Wilson told him to do as
he pleased.
Meantime Blackman is a free man, and
his sureties are not worth troubling about.
It is said that "William Kennedy, one of
the sureties, was promised $25 for going
on the bond, and when he went to the
saloon where Blackman and his friends
had agreed to meet him for his money
he was kicked out.

FEMAXE PICKPOCKETS.
Dene Smith and Kittie Fitzgibbon. two
of the most notorious female pickpockets
I In the country, were arrested last night
by Policeman Regan and charged with
I vagrancy. They were in the act of rob
| bir.g a stranger in front of the Palace
Hotel wlun recognized by the officer, and
Ihe placed th^m under arrest. The Smith
woman ha:* a ohnrge of grand larceny
pending against her in Judge Conlan's
I court.
Several weeks ago she was arrested for
i holding up a bucolic stranger on Stockton
I street "and robbing him of $65. She was
caught by Police Officer Fennel, after an
exciting chase, and was formally charged
iat the City Prison. For some reason no
I effort has been made to prosecute the
| case against her.
Captain Spillane is determined to prose
cute the women on the vagrancy charge,
notwithstanding their boast that they
have a "pull" with the Police Judges.
WANTS TO VOTE FOR SENATOR.
When the case of Assemblyman-elect
Charles F. Kennealy, charged -with man
slaughter in causing the death of the old
man, William Quane. at Third and
Brannan streets, Thursday, was called in
Judge Mogan's court yesterday morning
Attorney Ach, for the defendant, asked
for a postponement.
"The Coroner's inquest." he said, "has
not yet been held, and the defendant is
about to leave for Sacramento to attend
the opening of the State Legislature as
Assemblyman from the Twenty-ninth
District. A vote for United States Sena
tor will be taken there about the middle
of January, and the defendant does not
want to be deprived of his vote. I would
therefore ask that the case be continued
till January 23."
After some discussion the request of the
defendant's attorney was granted, and
the defendant, who is out on his own re
cognizances, promised that he would be
in court when the case was called.

Medals for Firemen.
The Intention to present the two Scan

HAY WILL DISAPPROVE HAWAIIAN CABLE CONCESSION.
NEW YORK, Dec. 30. â The Herald's "Washington correspondent sends
the following: Secretary Hay has practically decided to disapprove
the Serymser concession granting exclusive rights to land cables
in Hawaii for twenty years to the Pacific Cable Company of New York.
Secretary Hay stated to his colleagues in the Cabinet meeting to-day
that the Hawaiian commissioners had sent him a formal letter declaring
that in their opinion the control of the Hawaiian cable should remain in
the hands of the United States, even if not built by it, as the commission
would recommend, and that no private company should have a monopoly
in the matter.
Practically the entire Cabinet coincided in this view and when the sub
ject was dropped it was with the understanding that Secretary Hay would
disapprove of the concession.
Two corporations are striving for permission to construct a cable be
tween San Francisco. Guam, Wake Island and the Philippines. One is the
Pacific Cable Company of New York, the other the Pacific Cable Comruny
of New Jersey. The first owns the Serymser concession.
Mr. Serymser, seeing that annexation was inevitable, went to Hawaii
last spring and procured from the Legislature a concession granting him
exclusive rights for twenty years, provided the Secretary of State of the
United States did not disapprove within six months from the date of the
concession. , These six months are up on January 2.

PRACTICES OF EARLY JEWS
NOTHING TO FOBBID PLURAL
MARRIAGES.
"Abraham, Isaac and Jacob Are in
Heaven," Says the Rabbi, "and
Did Jesus Say Anything
Against Polygamy^"
Special Dispatch .to The C*U.
KANSAS CTx i. Mo., Dec. 30.â 1n dis
cussing the election of B. H. Roberts
of Utah, confessed polygamist, to the
i National House of Representatives,
! Rabbi Schulman, pastor of the Church
i of B'Na! Jehudah, and pastor-elect of
the Temple Bethel, New York, practi
cally defended the institution of po-
I lygamy.
â Roberts cites the polygamy of the
' patriarchs in justification of the prac
i tice to-day," said an interviewer to the
I rabbi. "How does the Jewish church
', reply to that?"
"Isn't Abraham in heaven, and Isaac
and Jacob?" retorted the rabbi. "We
I don't need to answer that. The Chris
! tian preachers may take up the gaunt
â  let. What Congressman Roberts says
i about the early Jews does not worry
me. I have assurances that they are
all right, and my Bible is clear to me.
What will the Christians say In reply
'' to him is the question. Did Jesus say
i anything against polygamy? No, he
; did not. Let them explain on what pre
cepts of their testament they claim the
, practice unholy and unrighteous.
"Polygamy is very expensive. It
j could be indulged in by men who owned
â  vast herds and occupied extensive do
1 mains over which they ruled. As popu
i lation increased and wealth became
! divided and the system of government
changed it was naturally abandoned.
I People who could afford it do not care
i to return to such an expensive mode of
living and one that grew out of con
! ditions so utterly anachronistic. I do

TO BE UTILIZED WITH
MIRACULOUS EFFECT
Claimed, to Be the Most Important
and Remarkable Discovery of
Modern Times,
Will Alleviate Pain, Destroy the Bacilli of
Disease and Tend to the Prolongation
of Human Life,
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, Dec. 30.
ANEW discovery in electricity and electro therapeutics will
be announced as soon as certain papers have been filed
in the United States Patent Office. This discovery or
new application of electricity to the science of therapeutics will,
it is claimed, startle the world. It is nothing short of miracu
lous, and will prove to be the most important and beneficial
discovery of modern times, for it will alleviate pain, destroy the
bacilli of disease and tend to prolong human life.
These meager facts were obtained from a lawyer of national
reputation who is now in Washington arranging preliminaries
for filing an application for a patent. He positively refused to
explain the process by which the electricity is to be applied to
therapeutics, but promised to give a statement to the press
when all was ready.
"A layman." he said, "would find it difficult to understand;
indeed, it has puzzled electricians and medical scientists. One
explanation would not suffice. The subject will require a se
ries of technical papers, and even then what will result? Mys
tery as dense and as impenetrable as the theory of life itself.
But we will get practical results which will astound the world;
men will be ready to believe that the age of miracles has not
passed. Let me ask you a simple question any school boy
ought to answer: Is glass a conductor of electricity?"
"It is one of the best dielectrics or insulators known to
electricians." answered The Call correspondent.
"What would you say if I advanced the theory that glass
is a conductor of electricity? Would you call me a crazy man?
What would happen to you if you were to take hold of the
kicking ends of an electric arc light current?"
"1 would be boxed up and sent home to my friends," re
plied The Call correspondent.
"How many volts does it take to kill a man?" pursued
the attorney.
"It depends upon the subject," was the reply. "Say from
iooo to 2OOO."
"What would you say if I proposed that I couple you
into a circuit and turn on one million volts without hurting
you?"
"I would say to try a dog first," replied The Call repre
sentative, furtively observing his inquisitor and looking for an
easy mode of exit.
The attorney grew a little more communicative. "I can
buckle you into an electric current of one million volts and
you will not feel any physical sensation," said he. "Further
than that; 1 will guarantee to send you home feeling a hun
dred per cent better after your experience. If you are tired
and enervated I can fill your cells with fresh energy. If you
have any bacilli of disease in your system I can destroy them.
Would you believe me when I tell you that by several appli
cations of an electro-static current of tremendous potentiality I
can utterly destroy the bacilli of tuberculosis and heal the
lungs?"
"Have you succeeded in any such cases?"
"Yes, in a dozen cases. I tell you it is infallible. The
publication of this discovery will astound the medical world."
The attorney persistently refused to explain anything fur
ther about his client's invention. But from remarks carelessly
dropped it appears that the inventor proposes to take advan
tage of the fact that'glass is not an absolute resistant or non
uctor, but that a tremendous electrical current striking
against a glass case in which a human body is inclosed dif
fuses this tremendous current over the wide area of glass plates
and hence permeates all parts of the human body. :
The theory upon which electricity is employed in thera
peutics by this inventor is that repeated charges of static elec
tricity is not only certain death to various forms of bacilli with
out injury to the patient, but that each "cell" or "atom" or
"molecule" of the human body is a separate and distinct living
inism, or in other words, each is a tiny electric battery.
An ordinary current of electricity travels along certain
nerves which are the telegraph wires of the body and conveys
sensation to the brain. Electricity travels by the shortest route,
these currents, as ordinarily applied by ' physicians, are
ti circuited." In other words, the current does not perme
ate all parts of the system. But by employing a tremendous
electro static current and diffusing it over a wide area of glass
plate it can be made to permeate every cell of the body.
The attorney assured me that one charge of such a current
would vitalize the countless tiny electric batteries, and give new
energy to the body and brain. In other words, "make a tired
man feel as fresh as a daisy." And if he had any disease germs
in his system repeated charges would utterly annihilate them.
ALMAND IS KEPT IN

â¢fIJLABE, Dec. 30.â S. F. Almand â¢is

Econder to the amount of $40,000 or $50,000.
]i Is said that he was a merchant at

appeared when his defalcation became
known. He came here and secured a po
sition on the Paige ranch near town.
Some days ago a telegram was received
here for Almand, notifying him that offi
cers were on his track. Communication

who derided that he conld not be held on
telegrams from Georgia officials so was
released only to be rearrested. He is now
in the County Jail, but was taken before
a Justice to-day, who set the hearing for
Tuesday next. This will give the Georgia
officials time to reach here, one of whom

ployed, knows the Almand family of
Georgia Intimately, and feels that, there
is a mistake somewhere. Officer Carlisle,
who is the Gity Marshal of Tulare. made

JOSEPH ELLIOTT
DIES IN A CELL
The San Franciscan Is Supposed to
Have Been Crazed by the High
Altitude of. Denver.
DENVER, Dec. 30.â Joseph Elliott of
San Francisco was found dead in the City
Jail at 8 o'clock this morning. Death is
supposed to have been caused by conges
tion of the brain. Elliott had been in
jail since last Wednesday, when he was
locked up on a charge of insanity. A
railroad ticket from San Francisco and a
steamer passage ticKet identified him.
Some money was also found in his
pockets.
From appearances Elliott, while stand
ing with his back against the bars of the
ward, had fallen forward on his face and
then folded his arms about his head and
expired.. It Is thought that the high al
titude was the cause of his mental con
dition. Coroner Rollins will hold an au
topsy to ascertain the -exact cause of
death. John Elliott, a brother in San
Francisco, has been notified of the death,
but has not yet been heard from.

Kucelal Dispatch to The Call.
BURLINGTON, lowa, Dec. 30.â The
Hawkeye says that Ed Smith is rm
other than James C. Dunham, who
murdered six people near Sin Jose,
CaL, and for whom a reward of $11,000
is offered.
The prisoner was arrested here for
drunkenness a month ago and would
have been released to-day but for his
resemblance to- the description of Dun
ham, which had just been received. He
will be rearrested on the charge of
being a fugitive from justice, and will
be held pending instructions from San
Jose. He is said to be the exact ii
of the man wanted, and local officers
are positive he i.s Dunham.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 30.â There is very
little if any additional information at
this end of the line concerning the man
who is under arrest at Burlington,
lowa, on suspicion of being James C.
Dunham, the noted murderer, who has
been hunted so long and unsuccess
fully so far.
In speaking of the Burlington suspect
this morning Sheriff Lyndon says he
fears he is not the man, but as yet this
cannot be definitely determined. The
Burlington Sheriff is positive the sus
pect is really Dunham.- In his letters
the lowa officer says the man almost
perfectly fills the description of Dun
ham, and looks like the photo-graphs
which he has of the murderer.
In the description which the lowa of
ficer sent here he refers to a tooth miss-
Ing in the upper right row. A local den
tist has furnished the officers with
a statement that Dunham had one up
per tooth, nearly in front on the
left side, which was built up of gold,
though it did not show save by close
lilnation. While the dentist is posi
that it was on the left side, he has ,
ecord on his books. The Santa
i officers think the dentist might
listaken as to the location of the
I-, since, he speaks solely on memory
c work done. If it is a right upper
l, then the tooth missing in the
ect would go to form a strong link
ie chain. :
c lowa officer has sent specimens
c handwriting of the prisoner. This
at of an educated man. When cora
d with the known writing of Dun
ham, there may be some little simi
larity, but the best judges are inclined
to say that the writing- is that of differ
ent persons.

MANILA, Dec. 30.â The British schooner Esmeralda, which has
just arrived here from the Ladrone Islands, reports that after the
United States cruiser Charleston left the island of Guam, In June last,
the Spaniards refused to recognize the authority of Francis Portu
sach, who was verbally appointed by Captain Glass to continue his
former regime as Governor, and jose Sisto, a former public adminis
trator, was declared Governor. He armed part of the native guards,
collected a tax of $G a head and had secreted fifteen tons of powder
and a small stock of ammunition when the island was taken by the
Americans.
The schooner Albi reports the massacre of the Spanish garrison
by the combined native forces at Ponapi, Caroline Islands. Henry
Neoti, an educated chief, has been selected to be the ruler. He Is
said to be favorable to Americans.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30.â Secretary Long has Issued an order to
Captain Louis Kempff at Mare Island to proceed to Guam and take
possession of the island. It is understood that Captain Kempff will go
to Hawaii and to Guam on the Philadelphia or Bennlngton. Captain
Kempff is one of the highest ranking officers of the service, and has
been stationed on the Pacific Coast for a number of years. He is now
at Mare Island. He is familiar with the Ladrones, as he formerly
served with the Asiatic squadron.
Francis Portusach, whom the officers of the United States cruiser
Charleston left in charge of Guam, he being the only American
citizen there, is a native of Spain, where he was born about thirty
years ago. He took out his citizenship papers in Chicago during
the year 1888. He is said to be the son of a wealthy merchant of
Barcelona.
by the Eastern officers to establish '
identity is a scar over one eye, near the
brow. While it is not generally known.
and has not been mentioned in the cir- ;
culars sent out, it is said by the best of
authority that Dunham has a scar over j
one eye, which is not seen except at
dose scrutiny. When Dunham was a !
boy he was hit over thÂ»> eye by a buck- i
shot lir<:d from a rubber "flipper." It J
came near causing the less of an eye. j
When he recovered a scar was left, and
it is still there, or was when he was last I
set'n. The lowa Sheriff says that the |
man has what looks like a scar or
pock-mark over the left eye.
Sheriff Lyndon says the man refused
to let his photograph he taken, so he |
was wired by Sheriff Smith. When the '
warrant was sent Wednesday for his j
arrest it is presumed the lowa officer
intended t<> use fi>rre to take the photo
graph, as such is inferred from his tele
grams and letter. If so, this should ar
rive Monday or Tuesday. Until then |
nothing definite is expected.
Hattie S. Brewer has asked for let- j
ters of administration on the estate of ;
J. K. Wells, deceased, and this devel
opa a remarkable state of facts. When
Dunham slew the McGHncy family
Wells was one of the victims. He in- j
herited his mother's estate. The next
heir was Dunham's infant, Wells' |
nephew. It was the only one that es- j
caped in the entire household. The
child was adopted by M. T. Brewer, a !
great-uncle, and is now thirty months j
old. Its name is Percy Osborn Brewer.
Brewer was the administrator of the j
estate. He recently died, and now Mrs.
Brewer asks f<T letters. The estate Is
worth about $30,000, and consists of an
ideal orchard home at Campbell. Mrs.
Brewer lives in San Francisco.

HAVANA, Dec. 30.â A compromise
was to-day arranged by General
Brooke which satisfied the Cubans and
will result in all classes celebrating the
evacuation on Sunday. The Cubans
were still feeling greatly hurt this
morning over a refusal of the Ameri-
Generals Brooke and Menocal had a
conference in the Inglaterra Hotel, at
which it was agreed that full sway
should be given the Cubans for a
grand insurgent celebration to be held
in Havana on February 24, the fourth
anniversary of the uprising in Santi
ago province.
General Brooke told General Menocal
that the Insurgents might march and
feast to their heart's content at that
time.
When this became known good feel
ing revived and plans were immediate
ly begun for^ week's celebration. It
has already been decided that the for
mal disbandment of the insurgents'
force shall take place on February 24.
Active preparations for the relin
quishment of Spanish sovereignty are
being made, and by Saturday nierht it
will only require the lowering of the
flag to complete the agreement by
which the standard planted here by
Columbus is withdrawn forever from
America.
In the Governor General's palace at
Morro Castle, in all the barracks, at
the custom house, postofflce. offices of
the city government, everywhere, in
fact, the officials are closing up their
accounts, and by to-morrow night
every office will be cleared and the

who are to supplant the Spaniards.
Shippers have been notified to celar

suffer confiscation at the custom house,
and at the banks notices have been
posted that on and after Sunday Am

The plans for the actual transfer of
sovereignty are simple. There will be

IMPORTANT CLEW
TO THE CORNISH
POISONER FOUND
Consists of a Tooth
pick Holder.
IT WAS SOLD IN THIS CITY
NAME OF THE PURCHASER NOT
KNOWN AT PRESENT.
Letter From a Druggist T/uat May
Throw New Light- on
the New York
Tragedy.
.it h to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec 30 There is hope
that borders on certainty that the sil
ver-plated trinket received by Harry
Cornish through the mails may prove
a conclusive clew to the person respon
sible for the death of Mrs. Kate I.
Adams and the poisoning of Cornish.
It was not a bottle-holder, as it has
been represented to be, but a toothpiek
holder, or ash-receiver. A private
mark is stamped in the silver of this
little article, "No. 814, toothpick-holder
or match stand." It was made in New
ark. N. J., by Fi'ank A. Lebkeuchner
& Co., manufacturing silversjniths.
Mi. Lebkeuchner said that ' his New
York customers included the leading
silversmiths of the city. It was the
practice of all bu< h firms to keep track
of their wares, and "No. 814" should
be traced direct to the purchaser. .'
"A silver maU'h- holder or toothpick
holder such as No. S>l4 is rarely, if
ever, purchase <l f< 1 a. woman or by
one, unless it is intended as a present
for a gentleman. The little tray sur
rounding the cup shows in itself what it
is to be used for â cigar ashes, burned
matches or broken tooUipicks.
"There is no size of bromo-seltser
bottle made that fits that article we
made, ' said Mr. Lebkeuchner. "I tried
it myself to-day. All are either too
large* or too small. A bottle in a bot
tle-holder tits perfectly. The bromo
eeltser bottle must have rattled around
in No. 814 and showed plainly that it
did not belong there."
Captain MeCluskey of the detective
bureau said to-day that he had ascer
tained the store at which the tooth
pick-holder was bought, but he refused
to say what establishment it is. fur
ther than that it is in New York. Cap
tain McCluskey regards the clew as
the most important one that has been
developed thus tar.
This afternoon Mr. Lebke-uchner said
that only fifteen of the silver match
t=afes if the design sent to Cornish had
been made by his firm. Of these one
each had been Bold in the following
cities: New York, Brooklyn, Salem.
Mass.; Newark, N. J.; Baltimore. Syra
cuse, San Francisco and St. Louis.
Two were sold in Middletown. Coon.,
and five were disposed of ' to firms in
Ctiicago.
The names of the firms purchasing
them Mr. LeW:euchner withheld at th
request of the police.
District Attorney Mclntyre has re
ceived a letter to which he attaches a
certain amount of importance. It sug
gests that the poison that killed Mrs.
Adams may have developed from a
bromo-seltzer in the process of de
composition.
"This letter may shed light on this
mysterious affair," said he. "It may
prove that Mrs. Adams' death was an
unfortunate accident, and that there is
no crime back of it."
The letter in question was sent to Mr.
Mclntyre by 8. J. Russell, a druggist of
Jersey City. While reading the ac
count of the Adams poisoning case In
the papers, Mr. Russell's attention was
arrested by the statement that the
glass bottle containing the .. supposed
bromo-seltzer bore a label of a drug
company in Baltimore, Md. This re
called to his mind an invoice of bromo
seltzer which he had received from that
company, but which he had sent back
ns unfit for sale.
He then received from the company
a letter Baying the company had tried
granulating bromo-seltzer, but found |
that it did not keep well In that form j
and decided to abandon It.
The question raised by this letter is
whether the decomposition of the gran- '
ulated bromo-seltzer that was manu- i
factured by the Baltimore company is
likely to produce a poisonous sub
stance, and if so whether that sub
stance is the same poison which killed
Mrs. Adams.

believes that he has solved the mystery
surrounding the attempt to kill Harry
Cornish, physical instructor of the
Knickerbocker Athletic Club, by send

At 9 o'clock last; night Captain Mc-

The man under surveillance was for
merly a member of the Knickerbocker

It is well known that he from the
first associated Mr. Cornish with the

action.

With these general facts to guide
them, the police sÂ» t out to nnd evj
â  tint would connect this Derson
with the deadly parcel which was de
livered to Mr. Cornlftfe by the postman
at the Knickerbocker Athletic dub on
Saturday.
The first definite clew was the trac

Captain McCKtskey and his detectives. >
The chain of evidence is now said to
be almost complete and the arrest may
be made at any moment.
Mr. Adams, of Phelps & Adams, this
city, made the. following statement yes
terday regarding the toothpick-holder
received by Cornish: "Looking up ray
records, I found that we hare had in
Mock an article exactly answering the
description of the one sent to Mr. Cor
nish. It is on our records as a bottle
holder, and we have a bill of sale show
ing that it was sold to Bhreve & Co.,
on December 1, IS9T. I do not think
that our purchasers will be able to
trace it. as it was a small article, and
it Is improbable that they ever regis
tered it."
Mr. Bhreve, in an interview, stated
that it would be Impossible for him to
locate the purchaser of the article men
tioned. "I am not positive," he said,
"that it ever was in our store. If It
was, there sir-; two dozen men. any of
whom might have sold it. and it is un
reasonable to suppose that they would
recollect the sale. It was a small ar
ticle, one of the kind which we class an
'silver novelties,' and of which we
never talte any particular note. Ad
mitting that Mr. Adams' statement la
correct, we have hau two holiday
rushes since the artic'.e was purchased
and If any man should claim that he
sold it. I would attribute his statement
to an over-vivid imagination."
LIQUOR AND TOBACCO
AS COSILY AS BREAD
Grand Jury of Santa Clara County
Scores the Management of the
Almshouse.
| â¢ SAN JOSE, -Dec. 30.â Grand Jury,
! which was organized November 30, with
L. A. Sage chairman, reported to Judge
Lorigan this morning and was discharged.
I; makes the startling statement that thfl
amount of money expended for liquors
and tobacco at the Almshouse almost
equals that paid for bread. Acts of Board
of Supervisors 'are also crttlciiaed. " .
Referring to the Almshouse, the report
says: "Bills for tobacco and liquors al
most equal amount paid for bread, and we
fail to see th.> necessity for so much liquor
being us. d in a pla-ce of this kind. The
cost of maintaining inmates of the institu
tion is $9 14 per capita, and owing to the
great amount of produce raised the insti
tution should be conducted for ' less'
money."
The Board of Supervisors have allowed
some Irregular bills, and the Grand Jury
deals with the matter in this fashion:
"It has come to the knowledge of the
jury that claims for labor performed
have, by practices bordering on perjury
and subornation of perjury; "been paid
from funds of the county other than that,
to which they rightfully belong. We can
not condemn too severely this .reprehensi
ble, practice. It is misleading as to the
true purpose' for which county moneys
are expended and could be used to divert
the funds of the county to â¢illegitimate
purposes. We therefore recommend that
the Board of Supervisors adopt such rules
â  and regulations governing the expendit
ure, of public money; as will prevent for
J all times the unauthorized use by these
methods of the different funds of the
I county."
CHINA ACCEDES TO
THE FRENCH DEMANDS
'To Permit Extension at Shanghai,
Notwithstanding the Protest
of Great Britain.
LONDON, Dec. 31.â The Shanghai cor
respondent of the Times says: It is offi
cially asserted here that, in spite of the
j protests of Claude BCacdonald, the
! British Minister to Peking. China acceded
â  to the demands for an extension of the
| exclusive French settlement in Shanghai.
This result is due to pressure exercised
i at Peking, anil is likely to hamper the
negotiations for the extension of the cos
' mopolitfcfl settlement, in regard to which
j the Viceroy for .Nankin is disposed to
meet the views of the British, American
and German Consuls.
The Viceroy Is greatly chagrined at the
failure of Great Britain to support his
determined policy In the valley of the
i Yang-tse-Kiang at an important crisis.
â¢ Satisfactory conclusions ar>- not likely
to result from Hritish negotiations any
where in China so long as the personnel
of the Tsung H Yamen remains, as now,
â  actively hostile to Hritish interests.

THE NIPPON MARU LOADING FOR SAN FRANCISCO.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 30. â The steamship Victoria brings news that a
notable event In Yokohama four weeks ago was a reception given
aboard the Toyo Kisen Kaisha's new steamship Nippon Maru, which
is now loading for her maiden voyage to San Francisco. The elite of Tokio
and Yokohama officials and the business world were present as the com
pany's guests. The Japanese papers describe the Nippon as having finer
and more modern appointments than the Canadian Empresses. She re
sembles the Empresses in being white above and pink below her waterlino.
Her two funnels are yellow. Her trial trip speed of JT l^ knots marks her
as the fastest regular liner that crosses the Pacific. The furnishings of
her saloons, cabins and drawing-rooms are described as superb. Her pas
senger accommodations are: first-class. 92; second-class, 40; steerage, 600. A
feature of the reception was a speech by Mr. Tsukahara. vice president
of the line. He stated that the three 6teamship lines, one Japanese, one
American and one English, will each have three steamers in the Asiatic-
San Francisco trade and hoped that these three flags united in a com
bined service across the Pacific would symbolize the uniting of the same
flags in an international agreement and commercial supremacy.

at a Banquet.
SELF-RESTRAINT NECESSARY
IMPERIALISM INSPIRED BY
CUPIDITY.
One of the Speakers Denounces the
Protective Tariff as a Mere
Promoter of
Trusts.
Si>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
LINCOLN, Nepr., Dec. 30.â A compli
mentary reception and banquet to Col
on <-l William J. Bryan was tendered to
night by the Nebraska Traveling Men's
Club at the Lincoln Hotel. Invita
tions were sent to 250 admirers of Mr.
Bryan, which, with few exceptions,
were accepted. The only notable ab
sentee was Congressman Bailey of
Tt.\as, who was to have responded to
the toast "Democracy/ but who tele
graphed from Washington his inability
to be present. The dining hall was
thrown open at 9 o'clock and the
speechmaking began one hour later.
Mr. Bryan responded to the sentiment:
"America's Mission. Let not the Crime
of the East e'er Crimson Thy Name; be
Freedom and Science and Virtue Thy
Fame."
After complimenting the members of |
the club, for their fidelity to the Chi- j
casro platform, Mr. Bryan proceeded to
discuss the Philippine question.
lie insisted that, a colonial policy was
wrong in principle and unwise, and he
predicted that it would prove unprofit
able in practice. He said in part:,,
'You have labored diligently tft pre
vent foreign financiers froni disregard- j
ing the rights of the American ueoule. !
now you are called upon to use your
Innuence to prevent the American ueo- i
pie from disregarding the rights of I
others.' Self-restraint is a difficult vir- j
tue to practice. . Soiomon says that he
that' rules his own spirit is greater than
he that taketh a city. The American
people have- .shown that th^y can take |
a. city; will they be able to restrain I
the spirit of conquest?
"It has been the boast of our nation '
that right makes might. Shall we aban- ;
don the motto Of the republic and go
back a century to the monarchial motto j
which asserts that might makes right.
"Be not carried away by the excite
ment Incident to war; it will soon sub
side. Our people will turn again to the
paths ol peace; justice will resume her!
reign. Be steadfast In the faith of the ;
fathers. Four light is for yourselves as
well as your country. In the words of
the 'distinguished Georgian, Hill, -Who
saves his country saves himself, ami all
things saved, do bK-ss him, who lets
his country die lets all things die, dies â 
himself ignobly â and all thine* dying
curse him.'
"Imperialism finds the inspiration in
dollars, not in duty. It is not our duty
to burden our people with increased '
taxes in order to give a few specula- '
tors an opportunity for exploitation; it
is not our duty to sacrifice the best I
ir nation in tropical jungles \
in an atempt to stifle the very senti- [
ments which have given vitality to j
American institutions; it is not our
duty to deny the people of the Philip
pines the rights for which our forefath
. ra fought, from Bunker Hill to York
town.
"Our nation has a mission, but it 13
to liberate those who are in bondage â
not t" place shackles upon those who
are Struggling to be free.
"We rejoioce in the marvelous vic
tory won by Dewey In Manila Bay; we :
would give to him a sacred place in j
history and crown his memory with :
ingÃ. To us he is a hero; to the 1
Filipinos he can be a savior.
"Let him be known to posterity not!
as the subjugator of an alien race, but i
as the redeemer of an oppressed people !
not as Lord dive, but as a Lafayette, j
The gratitude of a people is better than j
a Jeweled sword."
The second most notable address was
that of Hon. J. G. Johnson. Democratic
national committeeman from Kansas,
who spoke to the sentiment "No
Trusts." He took the position that the
trust system of the country is the direct
outgrowth of the protective tariff sys
tem, without which to prevent foreign
competition there could be no success
ful cornering of any of the ordinary
manufactured products of the country.
He claimed that there was no present ]
financial activity except in trust-pro
tected industries, and insisted that the
system has all of the worst elements of
state socialism, without any of its ad
vantages to the public.
He dosed by exhorting his hearers
"to assist in the overthrow of the Re
publican party and thereby eliminate
both the protective tariff and the
trusts."
He thoueht there was no heaven-sent
call to carry freedom 7000 miles across
the sea when there is such a crying
need for financial, commercial and In
dustrial emancipation at home.
The other speakers were Governor
Holcomb. Governor-elect W. A. Poyn
ter, James Har.ahan. G. M. Hitchcock,
editor of the Omaha World-Herald;
Deputy Attorney General W. D. Old
ham and General G. B. Weaver of

CHOKER'S ACTION
CAUSES SURPRISE
Backing Sulzer for the
Leadership.
TAMMANY INFLUENCE NO
OTHERWISE MR. SULZER WOULD
NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.
With All the Talk, However, There
Is Little Danger of Ousting Bailey
From Minority Leadership
in the House.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 30.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Mr. Croker's action in putting
Representative Sulzer forward as a
candidate for the Democratic leader
ship in the House of Representatives
took the Democratic Representatives
here by surprise.
The general tendency in the House
has been to regard Mr. Siilzer as some
thing of a Jokeâ not so much so, per
haps, as James Hamilton Lewis, but
still a joke. But Mr. Sulzer, supported
by the powerful influence of Tammany
for party leader, is another matter and
must be taken seriously, for few Demo
crats believe that Mr. Croker has
turned humorist and put Mr. Sulzer up
as an aspirant for the leadership to
amuse himself and the House. Some
Democrats are inclined to take the mat
ter seriously enough, and indignantly
resent the idea of Tammany trying to
control the Democratic membership of i
the House of Representatives.
Strange as it may seem, Mr. Bailey,
the man whom Mr. Sulzer aspires to I
succeed, talks more favorably of his
candidacy than any other Democratic
Representative 1 have seen. When I
asked Mr. Bailey to-day what he
thought of Croker's candidate for the
party leadership in the House he said:
"Of course, .1 would naturally be
averse to discussing the candidacy of
any one of my opponents, but 1 do not
hesitate to say that Mr. Sulzer is a
man of ability and a loyal Democrat
and if New York intends to put for
ward a candidate Mr. Sulzer is en
titled to the support of Democrats
from that State, for he is certainly the
equal of any man in the delegation." â 
Mr. Bailey would not discuss the rela
tive strength of the various candidates
for leadership or the part' the New
York delegation with eighteen Demo
cratic members will play in determin
ing the choice of the caucus, but some of
his friends talk more freely. One of
them told me to-day that Mr. Bailey )
was assured of more than one hundred j
votes in the caucus. They say he can
be nominated for Speaker without a
single vote from New York, and that
if Mr. Sulzer is a candidate and re- j
ceives the entire eighteen votes of New \
Yiuk it will not hurt Mr. Bailey. â¢ i
.Mr. Bailey's supporters say that with- :
out the BUpport of the New York dele- i
gation no other candidate can hope .to ;
make much of a showing in the caucus,
and one of them went so far as to say
to me that Mr. Bankhead would not
be a candidate at rill if he could nut
get the support of the New York men,
and that Mr. Richardson would proba
bly withdraw from the race.
SAN RAFAEL'S BOY
BURGLAR IS TRAPPED
Captured in the Act of Robbing a
Safe, He Confesses Several
Daring Thefts.
SAN RAFAEL. Dec. 30 -Edward Mas
trup, the son of a car-builder In the em
ploy of the California Northwestern Rail
way Company, was caught in the very act
of "cracking" the safe of the firm of Knit
tel & Williams to-day, and afterward con
fessed that he was responsible for simi
lar breaches of the law.
Knlttel & Williams are well-known fur
niture dealers, and for over two years
Mastrup, who is only 20 years of a~e,
was in their employ as an upholsterer.
A few weeks ago he was "laid oft" on
account of a decrease in the volume of
business during the winter months.
Three times last week the safe of ihe
firm was opened and money taken out.
Suspicion fell upon young Mastrup, be
cause it was known that he had been
around the store a short time previous.
to each theft. He was also familiar with
the combination of the safe.
Deputy Constable Trainor was sum
moned to-day by Mr. Williams, and a
scheme laid to catch the thief. Trainor
hid behind a stairway and Williams stood
upon the sidewalk until Mastrup hap
pened by and dropped into conversation.
Telling Mastrup that he was going to a
lumber yard near by and requesting him
to watch the store during his absence,
Williams started away. As soon as he had
turned a corner Mastrup darted to the
safe, opened it, and grabbing a handful
of money wandered back to the front of
the store. Trainor, who had watched the
boy and saw the theft, then emerged from
his hiding-place and approached him.
j When Mastrup saw the officer he started
! to run, but a stern command to halt, ac-
I eompanied by the flash of a revolver,
; quickly stopped him. Realizing his pre
! dicament, he burst into tears.
A Bearcfa showed that Mastrup had se
cured $5 in gold and $4 05 in silver. The
; firm lost about $100 by the four thefts.
The gold coin was marked, making the
evidence of the burglary conclusive. Mas
trup was taken before' Justice Gardner
j and a charge of larceny, which will be
I changed to burglary, preferred against
i him. He was then lodged in the County
Jail. He sobblngly admitted to the au
! thnrities that he was the one who had
| committed the previous burglaries, and
might have known that he would in time
be caught His parents are nearly heart
i broken over the arrest.

NEW YORK, Deo. Jso.â The Morning
Telegraph says: The marriage of Wil
liam K. Vanderbilt Jr. and Miss Vir
ginia Fair has become the subject of
negotiations with the fathers of the
Catholic church at Rome.
From information received by friends
and relatives of the families in this
city it is evident that unexpected op
position has been encountered in the
original plan of having the wedding
ceremony take place in a Protestant
church in accordance -with the wishes
of the bridegroom and his family.-
Miss Fair is a Roman Catholic.
Young Vanderbllt is a Protestant. It
Is understood that Miss Fair has en
listed the services of her spiritual ad
viser in San Francisco Father John J.
Prendergast, vicar general of the arch
diocese, in order to secure the neces
sary dispensation from Rome for her.
Dispatches received here yesterday
are to the effect that as a result of
Father Prendergast's appeal the mat
ter was immediately laid before Car
dinal Parocchi, secretary of the Holy
Office. That functionary states that It
is impossible for a Roman Catholic
church to recognize marriage unless
the ceremony- is performed in a Roman
Catholic church by a local parish priest
or by a priest delegated by him, and in
the presence of witnesses.
Instructions have been .forwarded to
Father Prendergast requesting him to
use all his endeavors with his spiritual
child. Miss Fair, that she may seek be
fore her marriage to induce her l'uture
husband to join the Roman Catholic
church. ,

VICTORIA. B. C, Dec 30.â The
Bteamers Victoria and Yamaguchi Maru
arrived to-day with news from the
Orient to December 16. Another serious
calamity, writes the Hankow corre
spondent of the North China Daily
News, riles of which were received by
the steamers, has befallen the unfor
tunate town of Hankow. About a
month previous a terrible conflagration
destroyed a goodly portion of the town
and caused the loss of upward of 2000
lives, and now about a thousand if not
many more of the unfortunate inhabi
tants of Hankow have met death, not
by fire, but water being the agent this
time.
About noon on December 3 half a
street of houses extending from the
great Matou to the middle Matou, a
distance of about a 11 along the edge
of the river Han suddenly broke away
and tumbled into the water on the top
of all the boats there. At this par
ticular point the bank at present is
forty feet high and almost perpendicu
lar. The houses built on It, according
to the custom, extended a good deai
d the edge of the bank by the aid
of poles supporting them from under
neath. The river at this spot is very
deep and runs with a strong current.
There have been some freshets recent
ly which must have cut away the bank
below the level of the water, under
mining the banks on which the street
was buili, fur the whole gave way
without the least warning and houses
and boats with all their people in them
disappeared in a moment with a great
crash.
As usual it Is impossible to learn with
any accuracy the number of lives lost,
but the general statement Is that about
a hundred houses and the same num
ber of boats are gone and from a thous
and to one thousand five hundred peo
ple drowned. There is not much to be
seen at the place, nothing but a bare
bank, as clean cut away as If it had
been done with a huge razor and the
water covered with people busy fishing
up bodies or anything else they can
hook hold of.
The Japan Gazette says: Since the
attack on the Russian troops at Andi-
Jan bo me time bark discontent and dis-
Batiefactlon hav>> been rife throughout
the province. This feeling has assumed
such proportions that the Russian au
thorities have already strengthened
their garrisons by quintupling them.
They have moreover occupied a larger
village in force and superceded the
civil by a military administration. The
causes of this state of things are not
far to seek and in fact may be traced
to the barbarous rigor with which the
late rising has been suppressed. Not
jit to than 200 or 300 fanatics were en
gaged in the attack on the Russians,
yet, in one town it is asserted every
male adult resident was at one time
or another arrested, although it was
known that very few of the culprits
livc-d there. More than 1200 men were
arrested on suspicion and flogged in
order to extort information. Not only
were the actual malefactors punlshea,
but their relatives of all degrees were
also imprisoned. The special commis
sioner sent to investigate appears to
have imprisoned all from whom it was
thought evidence could be extracted.
In addition to this a fine of 300,000
rubles has been inflicted on the dis
trict, tho payment of which will fall
upon the respectable middle-class, who
had nothing to do with the attack.
The American, a Manila paper, says:
The revenue cutter McCulloch, after
circling Dewey's fleet while bands
played and tars cheered, has started
for home to join the Bering Sea patrol
fleet. The McCulloch left New York in
1897 to join the revenue cutter fleet in
Bering Sea, going by way of the Suez
canal and visiting all places of interest
on the Mediterranean. Upon her ar
rival at Singapore she found orders
awaiting her to join the Asiatic fleet
â with all possible haste, learning for the
first time of the difficulties between
Spain and the United States. She
made the quickest run from Singapore
to Hongkong of any steamer on this
coast, joining Admiral Dewey's fleet,
â where she took a prominent part in the
battle as a dispatch boat. She will be
several months in reaching the Bering
Sea, ar she is to visit all the principal
places on the coast of China and Japan,
going across the northern ocean by the
Aleutian Islands.

FRESH WITH
CHEMICALS

and Porto Rico.
SURGEON DALY'S REPORT
TELLS HOW FILTHY FOOD WAS
THROWN AWAY.
While the Beef Looked Well, It Had
a Sickening Odor, Like a
Human Body Bead of
Disease.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30.â The War
Investigating Committee to-day made
public a report, omitted in the state
ment given out yesterday, bearing on
the beef controversy. It is from Major
W. H. Daly, chief surgeon at army
headquarters at Tampa prior to the
sailing of the Shafter expedition, and
is as follows:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21. 1898.â T0 the
Assistant Adjutant General, Headquar
ters of the Army. Washingtonâ Sir: I
have the honor to report, in the interests
of the service, that in the several inspec
tions 1 made In the various camps and
troopships at Tampa, Jacksonville.
I'hiokamauga and Porto Rico, 1 found the
fresh beef to he apparently preserved
with secret chemicals, which destroys its
natural flavor, ami which 1 also believe to
be detrimental to the health of the troops.
While on duty at the headquarters of
the army at Tampa, at the time of the
embarkation of the Shatter expedition,
Colonel Weston, the efficient chief com
missary, showed me a quarter of beef that
had already, as a. test, been sixty hours
in the sun without being perceptibly
tainted, so far as the sense of smell could
determine. It is impossible to keep fresh
beef so long untainted in the sun in that
climate without the use of preserves, such
as boric acid or nitrate of potash, inject
ed into it in quantities likely to be
hurtful to the health of the consumer. At
Ponce much of the beef arriving on the
transports from tho Tinted States was
also of the same character, being appar
ently preserved by injecting chemicals
to aid deficient cold storage.
Where efficient cold storage is impossi
ble, transporting beef alive is the method
that should receive the fullest considera
tion by the Government, as being safest
for the health of the consumer. When
detailed to take charge of the transport
Panama for conveying convalescents to
the United States, I obtained 2000 pounds
of fresh beef from the commissary at
Ponce. It looked well, but had an odor
similar to that of a dead human body
after being injected with preservatives,
and tasted when rirst cooked like decom
posed bodies smell. After standing a day
for further inspection it became so bitter,
nauseous and unpalatable as to be quite
impossible for use. I was, therefore,
obliged, owing to the condition and the
complaints of the sick aiiout it. and the
disgustingly sickening odor it emitted
when being cooked, and its mawkish,
flat taste when served, and for the safety
of the patients, 255 convalescent sol
diers on board, to organize a board of
eurvey, condemn and throw 1500 pounds,
all we had, overboard. Consequently the
convalescents were entirely without the
much-needed fresh beef, making the duty
of bringing the men to the United States
In nn Improved condition a very difficult
In ray inspection of the Fourth United
States "Volunteer Infantry at Jacksonville
recently 1 observed the same odor and
taste upon the fresh beef, but not so
marked: and at the camp of the Sixth In
fantry at Chlckamauga I also, at several
inspections, observi d It markedly. I there
inserted a lot of beef just Issued to that
regiment and, while it looked well, it was
of a sickening odor, like a human body
dead of disease and injected with preserv
atives and when cooked It was quite un
palatable and consequently likely to prove
an efficient cause of ill health. The men
complained of its insipid and mawkish
flavor that high seasoning could not con
ceal.
Believing that the Commissary Depart
ment has been Imposed upon by the misdi
rected commercial spirit of persons fur
nishing fresh beef, I respectfully recom
mend that the matter be Investigated by
experts, making a quantitative and quali
tative chemical analysis of the several
preservatives suspected to be used by get
ting samples of beef furnished for export
to Cuba and Porto Rico.
If the -question arises that a report
should have been made by me earlier. I
beg to say that I have endeavored with
a!l my opportunities to first inform my
self by observations of the conditions, as
above noted, sufficiently to warrant my
drawing the attention of the adjutant
general at the headquarters of the army
to the matter. Very repp^ctfully.

"COMING
EDUCATION"
THE THEME
Meredith's Address to
the Teachers.
FAULTS OF PRESENT SYSTEM
IT IS TOP-HEAVY AND NEEDS
MANY INNOVATIONS.
All Matters Being Disposed Of, the
Thirty-Second Annual Session
at Santa Rosa Adjourns
Sine Die.
Special IMppatch to ThÂ« Call.
SANTA ROSA. Dec. 30.â The last
session of the 'California State Teach
ers' Association was called to order
promptly at 9 o'clock this morning by
State President George Chllds of San
Jose, in the Fifth street Methodist
Episcopal Church South. The build
ing was crowded with spectators.
Hon. Charles T. Meredith, State Su
perintendent of Public Instruction,
made his annual address. His subject
was "Coming Education," and his re
marks were heard with close atten
tion. He spoke in part as follows:
It Is no secret that there is much dis
satisfaction with the products of our
public schools. Many people are out
spoken, many merely saying nothing, but
prefer to bear the ills they have than to
fly to new ones. The mechanic complains
that we educate his children out of his
environment; the merchant that our edu
cation is not practical; the university that,
the graduates even of our high schools do
not have sufficient facility in the use of
English to admit them to the university
without examination.
Some months ago we engaged in a war
with Spain. A great army was assem
bled in a dozen camps. The young men
in this army constituted the flo^ver of
American youthâ the most nearly perfect
specimens of physical manhood t..at could
be found in all our land. No sooner, how
ever, were these young men marshaled
than with horrible fatality they were at
tacked by typhoid and malarial fevers.
They Bcemed unable to take care of them
selves; they had no officers to look after
them.
Every soldier had above him a major
general, with his division surgeon and nis
division inspector; a brigadier-general,
with a brigade surgeon and brigade in
spector; a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, a
major, a regimental surgeon, a captain
and two lieutenants, and all these offi
cers were charged with his care. JBut the
soldiers at once fell sick, and if the war
had continued for a space of two years
it would have cost us one-half of mat
magnificent army to learn what we should
have known at the outset.
Had the germs, the seeds of these
fevers, been as large as elephants, or even
as gnats, we should not have lost a man.
The fever germs are, however, a thou
sand times more deadly and just as much
an entity as the elephant.
The war. though costing us millions in
money ana thousands of lives, will prove
a blessing to the country, because it will
show us the importance of studying nature
In the infinitesimal. Disease germs lurk in
<\ Â«-ry house, in everything we use, and
we must learn to protect ourselves from
them.
The defects of our schools nre easily
to be accounted forâ we have to attempt
too much. The march of progress adds
every year new work to our course of
study: new and more Important.
To meet this demand we must make a
radical change in our whole system; it is
top-heavy.
At the conclusion of. Mr. Meredith's
address the convention went into busi
ness session. The principal business
done was the consideration of
the report of the committee on
resolutions. All of the resolutions
presented were adopted " with the
exception of that referring to the
necessity of the next Legislature mak
ing an appropriation to complete the
revision of the State series of textbooks,
which was referred to the council of
education, and the last, which was laid
upon the table.
A warm discussion was brought on by
the introduction by President-elect
Frederick L. Burke of Santa Barbara of
a resolution providing that hereafter no
member be altowed to vote at any
meeting of the association unless he
should have been a member at least
one year. Among those who spoke on
the subject were Superintendent J. W.
McClymonds of Oakland, P. M. Fisher
of Alameda, G. C. Clark of Santa Cruz
and F. L. Burke. The resolution was
finally carried by a small majority.
A resolution of sympathy was intro
duced by Richard D. Faulkner of San
Francisco and by the association or
dered telerraphed to Hon. E. W. Davis,
secretary of the State Board of Uni
versity Regents. Mr. Davis is now sick
in Riverside County.
A telegram was at this juncture re
ceived from the State Educational As
sociation of Washington, now in session
at Olympta. The greeting was re
ceived with applause and a like return
of compliments ordered forwarded at
once to the secretary of the Washing
ton association by wire.
There being no further business be
fore the association, a motion to ad
journ was declared in order. After be,
ing duh- made and seconded President
Childs. in a few well chosen remark?,
declared the thirty-second annual
session of the California State Teach
ers' Association adjourned sine die.
WROTE FAREWELL MESSAGE
BY LIGHT OF THE MOON
Before Committing Suicide by Drown
ing, S. Cereni Declared His "Wife
Sent Him to Hell.
TOMALES, Dec. 30.â The suicide of S.
: Cereni here yesterday was deliberate.
j Making- his way on foot to a bluff over
j looking the ocean, some miles from his
1 house, he took out his grocery pass-book
I and tore out all the accounts therein. On
i one of thp remaining blanks he wrote the
' following letter in Italian, the moon.
, affording him light:
"Dec. 27, '98.
"I think it is better to die all at once
than to die inch by inch. My wife to
; night told me to go to hellâ so I walked
| this far to find it. God may have mercy
on my poor, sweet innocent children.
i Good by! Happy New Year to all!
"S. CERENI."
Putting the letter and his purse in his
vest pocket he placed the garment In a
; very conspicuous place, with its white lip
i Ing outward. He then took the fatal
i plunge into Tomales Bay, and his body
was eventually washed by the waves into
a slight cavern and wedged there. It was
i considerably disfigured.

PROMOTIONS
Gold Bricks Were Scarce, but
There Was Plenty of the
Real Thing.
A Morning Meeting of the School Board
Depletes the Probationary List and
Creates New Departments.
Twenty odd teachers from the proba- i
tionary list placed by a simple resolution
in permanent positions from which all the
law and the good intentions of the in
coming Board of Education cannot shake
them, more teachers crowded on the al- j
ready well-stuffed "unassigned list," and i
a batch of day substitute pedagogues
carried in a moment through the 'proba
tionary period" and made full-fledged
teachers In the department, is the record j
of yesterday's meeting of the Board of |
Education.
The meeting was called through the mail
and for some reason or other the minority
members of the board did not receive their
notices until almost too late yesterday I
morning to be on hand. The push, how
ever, showed up promptly at 10 o'clock,
and by half-past that hour the minutes
of the four preceding meetings were ;
being read. Armer and Derham of the
minority arrived just in time to partlci- |
pate. Head did not turn up at all, and j
Superintendent Webster pursued his usual
policy by staying away.
That there was something doing became i
evident when the reading of the minutes |
was finishd. Gallagher immediately \
moved that a recess be taken, and, al
though Derham objected, the gang re
tired to the caucus room to marshal its >
vote for the forthcoming resolutions. I
Bantel was mad from the time he ar- j
rived, and had to be whipped into line. ,
He hud been handed a large and glittering
gold brick at Wednesday's meeting, ana
ne announced upon his arrival yesterday
morning that ne wouldn't vote for "a
thing the gang put up."
Even the caucus dla not bring him ]
around, and he was only coaxed out of !
his trance by the passage of his resolu- j
tion holding Miss Catherine Ball in her
position as drawing teacher. It was a pet
scheme of Bantel's, for the reason tnat
Miss Ball came out to this coast and be- j
i ame a teacher in the department Â±or
the sole purpose of introducing the Prang
system of drawing. Bantel was Instru
mental in introducing that system into
the schools and naturally was much in
terested in keeping it there, consequently
his solicitude mat Miss Ball be retained.
His resolution, which was passed only
upon reconsideration, was as follows:
Resolved, That the action of the Board
of Kuucalion in appealing from the decision
of his Honor, Judge BH'-her, in the case of
Mists Katherine Bail, teacner of drawing in
the department, be rescinded and the Judgment I
and order of the court be obeyed.
The report of the finance committee
which carried the payment of laborers'
claims to the extent of $SuO, was brought '
up and after considerable debate passed, I
though Armer and Derham put up a hard ;
tight against it on the ground that no
more money should be expended until
teachers' salaries had been paid. j
Baniel was still in the tulks when Wai- :
ler's report of the elementary committee
came up and he threw his vote against it
and aftÂ«*r its paramga moved for a recon
sideration. Waller amended by moving
for a reconsideration at once and after
other matters hud been disposed of and
Bantel quietly talked with, ho withdrew j
his motion and the report went through !
with no other opposition than that of Der- j
ham and Armer. The report effected <
numerous transfers and promoted several
day substitutes to the probationary list.
These newly created probationary teach
era were later in the meeting again pro- j
moted by a smooth resolution Introduced
by Dr. Ragan and made regular teachers
in the department.
Waller's report was as follows:
Your committee on elementary education re- |
Bpectfully recommends -â¢ follows:
That Mies K. CrookbUÃ, a regular teacher of |
tht- Hancock Grammar School, be assigned to
the eighth grade uÂ£ said Hancock Grammar I
School.

transferred to Adams School.
That Miss Agnes Thomas, of the day sub- i
stltute list, be elected a probationary teacher, i
and be assigned to a class in the Clement

S. L. WALLER, Chairman.
Dr. Ragan followed the elementary with j
the evening school report. Among the
numerous unique things It accomplisned
was the gift of two positions in two even-
Ins schools to Professor T. H. McCarthy, j
Professor McCarthy has been the uee-i
principal of the Washington Evening I
School. Dr. Ragan's report made him i
principal also of the Spring Valley School
â without losing 'vn the Washington School i
place or salary.

DR. D. F. RAGAN.
The very warmest thing of the whole
session was the shortest and most Inno
cently demeanored resolution presented.
It read as-follows:
Resolved, That the rules of the Board of
Education be suspended and that all proba
tionary teachers be and they are hereby elected
regular teachers in the department.
It was by that resolution that every
teacher of uncertain position after the
clean-up of Wednesday night was marie
â Olid in her place, and it passed the board
with only two votes against it. It was the
same resolution that made regular teach
ers of the three who were taken from the
substitute list and made probationary
teachers by the elementary report intro
duced earlier In the meeting. As a piece
of condensed smoothness it was the finest
that has yet come over the political pike.
It was shortly followed by one almost as
effective in its scone, the secondary edu
cation report, which was as follows:
Your committee on secondary education rÃc
ommends as follows:
That Miss Irene Reeves of the Polytechnic
High School be elected head of the Latin De
partment in said school.
That Miss Mary Donnely of the Mission High
School he transferred from the position of head
nf the mathematical department and be elected
head of the Kngllsh department of said school.
That Miss Ada Goldsmith of the Mission High
School be elected head of the mathematical de
partment of said HChool.
That Mins Henrietta Byrne of the secondary
substitute list be elected a regular High School
teacher and assigned to the Girl's High School.
That George Bates of the Mission High
School be elt-cted heud of the Latin department
in said school.
That Miss Lyda Carrol be assigned to the
head of the history department of the Mission
High School.
That Miss Emily P. Rhine, a regular teacher
in the Mission School, be assigned to the de
partment of natural science and German in
said prhool.
That Miss M. B. Conway, teacher in the
Polytechnic High School, be elected head of
the department of stenography.
DR. D. F. RAGAX.
Like those that had come before it, the
secondary education report was shot
through the ranks with only the ineffec
tual opposition of Derham and Armer,
and It was shortly followed by a motion
to adjourn until this morning, when work
along the same line will be resumed and
finished for the year.

j station made a neat capture of an early
J morning- burglar named Nick Strauss aa
' the latter was coming: out of the paint
shop of Edward Norman at 1665 Mission

intention of robbing the shop, and the
man to whom he made known his plans
Immediately told Norman of the purposed
robbery. Norman in turn notified Captain

Nolan to watch the store. They did so,
with the foregoing result. Strauss was
booked on a charge of burglary.

The trouble with too many country wo-
men is that they do not sufficiently realize
the supreme importance of keeping healthy
in a womanly way. A woman's general
health cannot be good if she suffers from
local weakness and disease. If she suffers
in this way, the strongest woman will soon
break down and become a weak, sickly,
nervous, complaining invalid. Dr. I'ierce's
Favorite Prescription cures all weakness
and disease of the organs distinctly femi-
nine. It acts directly on these organs,
making- them strong, healthy and vigorous.

GUILTY fIS CHARGED.
A JURY made up of representative men has de
clared Cordelia Botkin guilty of murder. The
verdict will receive approval. Justice will be
satisfied with the fixing of the penalty at imprison
ment for life. While morally on the plane with one
o: the other sex, and as a defendant, equal before
the law, there is an irrepressible tendency to show
deference to a woman even though the blood of inno
cence be on her head.' This is in token of a senti
mentality inborn, and the advocate of capital punish
ment would pause before consenting to its violation.
Therefore the community, weary of travesty, impa
tient of the immunity of the transgressor, will say to
the jury that it has done well.
Alter the preliminaries relative to possible extradi
tion, the trial from the first moved with remarkable
celerity. There was little wasted time save that de
voted to abasing witnesses for the State. The attor
neys for the prisoner must have felt that they had a
hopeless fight, or different tactics would have been
adopted. They would not have devoted hours to
points which could avail them nothing unless by con
fusing the twelve in the box, and the twelve were not
of the material to be confused.
Among assassins the Botkin woman is almost
unique. Apparently shallow, there was shown to be
hi her composition a depth of guile hard to compre
hend. With the gallows looming up before her, she
seemed to be frivolous, unconcerned, at times for
giving. She lied with a nonchalance meant to be
winning. She posed as even-thing she was not; she
was innocence, virtue, kindness. No evil thought
had entered her mind. Yet all the time she knew
the unblemished victims of her plot, a plot as dia
bolical as ever directed by the fury of thwarted lust.
lay dead in a distant State. She i r a monster, devoid
of conscience, of sympathy, of the nobler impulses.
Her egotism has crowded out the good there may
have been in her. To others it worked death, to her
it worked a ruin far worse than death.
To have permitted this social viper to escape would
have been a new shame upon the fair fame of the
State in which justice has received many a blow in
the house of its friend 1 :. There will be in the end
of this evil doer a salutary lesson. Xo crime can be
?o cunningly devised that the criminal may not be
hunted down. An idle word may lead to exposure, a
guilty conscience betray. The most despicable, de
liberate and cowardly murder possible is that in which
poison is the chosen instrument. There will be no
sane pity lavished on Mrs. Botkin. She challenged
fate and it has overtaken and overcome her.
"CANADA ON THE B*INK"
A TORONTO paper in a fit of hysterics pro
claims that the United States intends to ab
sorb Canada. It heads its shriek, "Canada on
the Brink," but could more properly have termed it,
"The Editor Takes a Drink."
Canada is in as much danger of absorption by this
country as she is of being snatched up in a chariot
of tire. Uncle Sam has his hands so full that the
f his own government have to be held in his
teeth. He has Porto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines,
Guam, and here and there some isolated speck which
formerly belonged to somebody else, and the truth
must be confessed that he does not know what to do
with them. It is not simply a case of having enough;
he lias too much. Let Canada possess her troubled
soul in peace. There is no aspiration to sever the
revered apron-string which binds her to her grand
bcr land.
It seems that General Wilson made a speech at
Macon in which he permitted the eagle to soar. He
wanted the "starry flag to float everywhere, from the
frozen north, to the sunny clime of Central America."
The Canadian editor observed the sentiment, and
straightway acquired a case of jimjams. He shouldn't
ha\e nvnded General Wilson. The General was in
dulging in a patriotic figger of speech. We don't
want Canada. We are not bent upon wiping out the
dividing line. We used to have some domestic di
viding lire-, wiped them out, and are satisfied.
Cubans seem to think that they have a right to par
ticipate in the events marking the evacuation of
Havana by the Spanish; and if this country invaded
Cuba in good faith, on behalf of the Cubans, as was
sef forth at the time, the Cuban contention is right.
In the construction of the ferry depot the State lost
only $70,000, and the feilows who caused the State to
lose it not only got the money., but escaped p^inish
ment. There seems to be an opportunity for con
gratulations all around.
It is cheering to notice that the cjuiser Buffalo
has broken a record. Heretofore it had broken noth
ing more than its own machinery-
Senator Butler of North Carolina must already be
gin to be sorry that he spoke.
EX-CONFEDERATE PENSIONS.
THE recent Southern tour of the President
brought out the hearty feeling of nationality in
that section and gave a needed sense of the ab
solute security of the Union and the passing of the
lost cause forever.
Men who have chosen to rise above the influence
of prejudice have long desired that the martial inci
dents of our civil strife should be placed in history as
the common heritage of the American people. The
soldiers of the South and of the North met and fought
and died, like men, each for a cause and an idea.
i Each proved the courage and fighting resources of the
! race, and their strife notified the world that, united
: under one flag and for one cause, the men of the two
sections could beard the embattled nations and for
ever defend their country against the joint armies of
the world.
It is pleasant now to have all this recognized, and to
have a Northern man able to say it without being
i taunted as a rebel sympathizer, and a Southern man
without being hounded as a traitor to the lost cause.
Out of this agreeable situation that has been cre
ated by the skill and address of the President has
issued the Quixotic proposition that Confederate vet
erans be admitted to the national pension roll on
j terms of equality with the Union soldiers. Senator
| Butler of North Carolina, who is not a Confederate
i or any other kind of a veteran, has introduced a bill
tc that effect.
There has long been a feeling that the pension list,
'. which now requires nearly our whole income from
customs duties to pay it, is on a scale too extrava
gant for even our great resources and tax-paying
1 power. Politicians have gone on inventing new
classes of pensioners until the immense appropriation
! for that purpose has become a menace to many other
; interests.
Twenty years ago, when General Garfield reported
the pension appropriation bill, which called for thirty
i eight millions, he said to the House that he was aware
that it would startle the country, but that he was able
to say that in that bill the pension appropriation had
j reached high water mark and from that point would
i progressively decline. Instead of declining it has ad
ivancedto one hundred and forty-eight millions a
: year, and is still increasing. Up to this time no mcm
i ber of Congress has dared propose a remedy. None
has had the courage to attempt a restoration of the
original idea and purpose of a military pension.
I Originally the system was provided to make good a
i soldier's self-supporting capacity to the extent to
i which it had been impaired by wounds or disease suf
j fered in his country's service, and to care for depen
| dent parents, widows or minor children deprived of
i their support by the loss of life or capacity caused by
I military service. There is every reason to believe that
if this idea were restored the pension appropriation
! would decline to less than fifty millions a year. When
! Garfield made his pledge to the country that idea was
! still the spirit of our pension laws. But it is now no
| longer considered.
It will easily appear, then, that instead of admitting
Confederates to our pension roll we should purge it
of thousands who are not in physical need of the
bounty.
Acts of amity and forgiveness are praiseworthy.
But expressions of that spirit should not be accom
panied by demands for money. It is unfortunate that
Senator Butler has attempted to turn a friendly and
patriotic situation to such uses.
There is, however, a modified proposition that is
deserving of support. The nation has many Soldiers'
Homes to which the decrepit and disabled Confeder
ate veterans may be properly admitted to be cared
for.
The first of these homes was founded at George
town, in the District of Columbia, by the tribute
which General Scott levied on the City of Mexico
when it surrendered to his assault. Northern and
Southern soldiers fought there side by side, and their
common valor won the endowment of that home.
The disabled veterans of the Confederacy surely may
find there a shelter to which they have a hereditary
right, and, if there, why not in any other of these
homes in which there is ample room and where their
presence would be beneficial and proper?
We note with pleasure that the G. A. R. posts are
petitioning to have this done. There is not a Union
veteran who, on the battle-field, would have refused to
share the water in his canteen with a wounded Con
federate with whom he had just been in death-dealing
conflict. To share with him also the protection of
these homes is simply an extension of that gallant
spirit of humanity, and it ought to be done.
A KANSON COMPLICATION.
KANSAS is once more bleeding, and this time
the dripping gore seems to be in the nature of
a bloody sweat. She has in her penitentiaries
fifty-nine convicts under sentence of death for murder,
while in the office of Governor she has a bland phil
anthropist who, being opposed to capital punishment,
refuses to sign death warrants. Moreover, her newly
elected Governor is of the same mild philosophy, and
Kansas sees before her another series of years during
which she will collect and store up murderers in her
prisons until she has a collection unrivaled for its
number and variety.
Kansas, however, desires no such collection. She
is not a faddist on the subject of murderers, and that
is why she bleeds. Her Legislature is now engaged
in trying to force the Governor to sign death warrants
or get out of office. A bill to that effect has been in
troduced into the Assembly, and there is reported to
be a strong probability of its passage. The bill de
prives the Governor of his option with respect to the
execution of persons sentenced to death, and makes
it mandatory upon him to sign warrants for execu
tion.
A report from the center of the disturbance at
Topeka states that the Governor has declared his will
ingness to sign the bill if it passes the Legislature,
because he will be out of office before it could go into
effect, and he, therefore, will not be called upon to
sign the warrants. That duty would devolve upon his
successor. From this it appears that the Governor
is not opposed to the execution of murderers, but
only to signing the warrants for their execution. If
he can shift that work upon some one else he is per
fectly willing to see the death penalty enforced.
Here is a curious case of casuistry. A man has
scruples of conscience against the death penalty and
will not sign warrants for that purpose, but, knowing
that his successor in office has similar scruples, he is
willing to approve a bill which will compel that suc
cessor to sign the warrants or to get out of office.
As a matter of fact, the Governor's approval of the
bill before the Legislature is virtually equivalent to
signing the death warrant of the whole collection of
murderers now in prison. He is willing to sign that,
but not willing to sign a single warrant. Clearly a
conscience so delicately adjusted as that is enough to
make Kansas bleed and howl.
With all due respect to the conscience of the pres
ent and that of the incoming Governor, fifty-nine per
sons under sentence of death at one time is too many
for a State of the size, population and general cul
ture of Kansas. To have to put them all to death at
one swoop is to require her to enact something like
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1898.
a massacre, and yet if she does not consent to the
massacre now it will have to be a holocaust later on.
The collection is increasing too fast.
TO question the verity of announcements made of
discoveries in science ill becomes the lay mind.
Some recent discoveries were only a few months
ago scoffed at as impossible. Thus when an extraor
dinary statement is made the wisdom of the un
believer is shown in the holding of his peace.
In the first place, medical research made clear that
diseases were due to the presence of germs.
Phthisis, fever, stomachache, baldness, senility and sin
are each represented in the human system by a set of
minute and malicious organisms. Cure,, of course,
consists in wooing these from their living habitat and
expelling them into an outer and uncongenial en
vironment, where they perish miserably or hunt out
a new victim.
Ever since the finding of these bacilli science, lull
armed for war, has been upon their trail. Now it
claims to have caught up with the festive destroyers
of health and happiness, and to be prepared
not simply to expel but to slay them. At the
touch of the force which is to be his undoing the
baffled bacillus will curl up and die so quickly as
never to know what struck him. It is a cheering pros
pect. Farewell to pain, to potions and to pills.
Good-by to wickedness and woe. We will live forever
and be always young. Chief Lees will renew his
youth.
The potent force, as any one may surmise, is elec
tricity. One million volts are to be turned loose in the
ailing human frame, going through it like a streak of
greased lightning and slaughtering bacteria at every
jump. Whether it is to be captured as it emerges and
utilized again as a curative agent or employed to run
the engines of the world has not been revealed. There
is also but a shady inkling as to how the human
frame, wont, as it is, to wither when accidentally re
ceiving a dose of 2000 volts, is to be fortified against
the presence of a superior quantity. If the concen
trated million volts were to fly the track while mak
ing its tour of a patient and attempt a short cut to the
exterior there would in all likelihood be mischief
wrought to that patient so marked that the bacillus
would have the laugh on him.
These speculations, however, are almost frivolous.
Science has accomplished great things, and as there
were some left to be accomplished nobody at the
present stage has the right to say she has not been
adding to the record. There may be doubt, but to
express it would be unseemly. We would go no
further than to suggest that when this million-volt re
juvenator is first turned loose it be tried on an un
v.orthy person under sentence to electrocution. Then
if the mechanism slip a cog and the bacilli and the
tissue nurturing them are snuffed out simultaneously,
no harm will be done.
AT a ioint meeting of the Committees on Health
and Police, Licenses and Streets of the Board
of Supervisors on Thursday it was decided to
amend the ordinance regulating the height ot ad
vertising billboards so as to impose a license of 5
cents pef square foot upon all of them which rise
over twenty-two feet above the sidewalk. Thus
changed, the measure will be reported to the board
with a favorable recommendation.
This is a compromise of the original proposition
and is eminently unsatisfactory. If the billboard
owners think that any such arrangement is going to
satisfy the public they will later on find themselves
mistaken. They may succeed in getting their ridicu
lous ordinance through the Board of Supervisors, but
even if Mayor Phelan signs it â which is not prob
ableâthe whole subject will be ripped up in the next
board and new legislation proposed.
The demand in this case is for shorter billboards,
the elimination of every kind from certain localities
and a license fax upon all. Nothing less than this will
satisfy anybody except the billposters. The high
billboards are a dangerous nuisance, and, sooner or
later, like the Chinese, they will have to "go." There
are portions of the city where they never should be
permitted at all. If an ordinance such as we suggest
were now upon the statute books the unsightly nui
sance which is certain to inclose the Baldwin Hotel
for months would be forbidden.
As for a license tax, that has been argued again and
again with but a single result. We agree with an
evening contemporary that justice demands the impo
sition of a license tax upon billboards. These adver
tising devices pay nothing toward the support of the
government, yet they are more profitable than many
lines of business which are heavily taxed. They give
practically no employment to anybody, and besides
bcil g dangerous in many cases, they are always a
rank arrd horrible offense to the eyes and senses.
There is not the slightest excuse for exempting them
from taxation.
Another point justifies their regulation, and taxa
tion. They compete with all forms of legitimate ad
vertising and draw their revenue from lines of busi
ness which are licensed and heavily taxed. It is an
uiiiust discrimination to pass any such ordinance as
is under discussion. Business men and taxpayers
generally have a right to protest against a system
which taxes them and exempts almost entirely from
the burdens of government a profitable industry.
The public demand for an equitable ordinance will
not be satisfied with the puny thing reported by these
committees. Therefore it is idle to pass it. The Su
pervisors will do well to throw it in the waste-basket.
The mere fact of having been a witness in the Bod
kin case was insufficient excuse for the insults heaped
upon those so unfortunate as to have been called.
To term a spectacled woman who works for a living
"a goggle-eyed pot walloper" was not a proud
achievement, nor one to be defended on any ground.
The San Luis Obispo constable who arrested three
innocent boys on a charge of horse-stealing is now
under arrest himself, but says he does not know why.
At least he can understand how the boys felt.
Perish the thought that a man whose motives are
so pure as Dennery's and whose methods so above
reproach should wickedly be deprived of a seat to
which admiring constituents elected him.
The political future of ex-Governor Merriam of

WONDERS OF SCIENCE.
(\ POOR COMPROMISE.
RANCH AND RURAL LIFE.
The experience of stock men in this State for the last year will give a
great impetus to the raising of alfalfa. The losses in live stock which come
in a dry year, and could be averted by artificial production of forage, will
have a tendency to put thousands of acres of grain land into alfalfa wher
ever that crop can be irrigated. The keeping quality of alfalfa hay is a
great recommendation. It stands in the stack for years with its nutritive
quality unimpaired. The outside will weather and turn gray, but a few
inches under this the hay is as green in color and as sound as the day it
was stacked. The extension of alfalfa acreage will check the spread of
vineyards and orchards in the irrigable valleys, and so have a conservative
effect by repressing the fear of overplanting of trees and vines.
A new domestic industry is springing up in California in the manufac
ture of chutney sauces. The peppers and spices used in these famous East
Indian sauces are produced here as well as there, and the product is making
its appearance through the Woman's Exchanges.
It is estimated that all the merchantable pine timber east of the Mis
souri River will be harvested and marketed within the next fifteen years
and that the supply on the Pacific Coast will be exhausted in forty years.
As far as California is concerned there is no need of ever exhausting tho
supply. By intelligent care the crop of forest timber can be reproduced
and grown so as to keep pace with the demand. If the people will get it
into their heads that timber should be treated as a crop, they will no
more think of abolishing that crop by wasteful harvesting than of cutting
their orange and peach orchards to harvest the fruit. The first thing to
be done here is to protect our forests from fire. If it will take forty years
to chop them down, fire can destroy them all in ten years at the present
rate of destruction.
Our ranchers who have to consider the value of a variety of field crops
for rotation should give more attention to broom corn. There is a largo
importation from the East. In lowa, Illinois and Kansas this crop is bring
ing this year $70 a ton. The seed is taken off and used for poultry feed;
for which purpose it is the equal of wheat or Egyptian corn.
The United States Weather Bureau publishes a table of the weignt of
water per acre by inches of precipitation. This table should be pr< I
for reference by every rancher in California, whether he depends on irri
gation or the clouds:
.25 inch 28 tons 2.25 inches 255 tons
.50 inch 56 tons 2.50 inches 283 tons
.75 inch 85 tons 2.75 inches 311 tuns
1.00 inches 113 tons 3.00 inches 339 tons
1.25 inches 141 tons ! 4.00 inches 452 tons
1.50 inches 170 tons j 5.00 inches 565 tons
1.75 inches 198 tons 6.00 inches 678 tons
2.00 inches 226 tons
In this reckoning 200 imperial gallons are estimated at one ton of 2009
pounds. The average rainfall tor this season for the whole State is 3
inches; the average per acre therefore is 339 tons, or 67,800 gallons. As each
inch of water is 22.600 gallons, an irrlgator can estimate the amount in 'gal
lons and tons he is putting on his land.
Mr. Roberts, an Inyo County dairyman in Round Valley, has built a sub
stantial stone silo for the storage of ensilage for green winter feed for
his herd. If equal foresight were shown by dairymen in other parts of the
State and less reliance on the varying seasons for forage the State would
need to import less dairy products than now.
The Record Union says that a considerable crop of oranges was raised
at Folsom this year and sold for $3 2S a box in San Francisco. Truly the
all-California orange is coming to the front.
"We import largely from China the cumquat preserve. It is made of a

cumquat.
Oakdale, San Joaquin County, reports a large and excellent orange crop.

The fruit canners and driers, who pit their product, have been at a
loss what use to make of the tons of pits they accumulate. There has been
a limited legitimate market at the nurseries for planting for grafting Bto< ks
and an illegitimate trade in peach, apricot and nectarine pits to the con
fectioners, who use them as a substitute for almonds. But now the Pasa
dena Star says they have come into use as fuel. Peach pits sell for that pur
pose at $6 a ton and apricots at $5. At canneries it will be found that these
pits will supply the fuel needed in operating the machinery, thus effecting a
considerable economy.
Well-Fargo shipped 1500 packages of celery as presents to its employes.
The celery, was grown in the peat lands south of Anaheim.
The citric acid factory at North Ontario has been closed. The reason
given is that the lemons carry a lower percentage of the acid that limes,
from which it is usually made. This is rather strange, because citric acid
is profitably made in the East from imported lemons that are decayed
and unsalable, and there are factories at National City and La Mirada, in
San Diego County, that are running profitably on cull lemons.
Serapian Brothers, at Fresno, have so improved the curing of California
figs as to get nearly the price of the imported article. They are Armenians
and followed the fig trade in Greece. They propose next year to operate
largely and will buy the fig crop on the trees.
W. F. Burllngame, National City, gets $250 an acre for the peas raised
between the rows of trees in his young orchard. That is the answer to the
question, "What shall I live on before my orchard bears?"
The San Diego Union says that Mr. Dixon's pineapple plantation at
Point Loma and Mr. Sheldon's fields are covered with lath sheds or thin
cloth, to equalize the temperature. The shedding costs about $500 per acre,
and an acre grows ten thousand plants. A six-pound pineapple brings
75 cents.

Its membership is limited to six, but it
can be safely paid that six moro princely
liars were never banded together for the
purpose of escaping the truth. Its mem

laws of the club provide that when the
club is in session no member shall tell
the truth without being fined, and that
every member shall to the best of his
ability vilify all other members. An
other strange law of the club is that
every member, whenever the organiza

ridiculous nickname more or less appro

permitted to bring with him to these
nightly gatherings a friend, provided that
friend is rated as a second class liar.

A POINTED LETTER.
Weather Chief Moore Writes One Re
garding Work Done by His Office.
Hugh Craig, president of the San Fran
cisco Chamber of Commerce, is in receipt
of a letter from Willis L. Moore, Chief of
Weather Bureau at Washington, D. C,
in which the latter refers to an article
which appeared in the Sacramento Rec
ord-Union, in which it is advocated that
the Legislature be urged to place at the
disposal of the Regents of the University
of California $25,000 to inaugurate a thor
ough investigation Into the great prob
lem of rainfall and water supply of the
State.
The paper strongly urged that the ap
propriation be made because it will be
folly to await slow action on the part of
the "Washington bureaus, and there is not
at Washington as yet profound interest
in the climatology of this coast.
Chief Moore in his pithy communication
takes issue with the Record-Union on its
published statements, and charges it with
being unfair In view of the fact that the
Weather Bureau has made an investiga
tion into the dependence of the Pacific
Coast's precipitation upon temperature
conditions of the Aleutian Islands; that it
has vigorously prosecuted every line of
inquiry that promises beneficent results
to the coast, and that sfeveral of its ablest
scientific men are now investigating this
very problem.
"I beg to state," continues Mr. Moore,
"that seven of the sixteen metereological

ENJOY A BANQUET
FIRST REUNION OF TRAVELERS'
PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION.
An Excellent Menu, Good Fellowship,
â  Responses to Toasts and Stories
Such as Only Commercial
Men Can Tell.
The California Division of the Travel
ers' Protective Association closed its an
nual session by a banquet in an uptown
cafe last night, the first that It has ever
given. There were present in the very
tastefully decorated dining hall and
seated around the several tables dressed
with most artistic taste about one hun
dred and twenty persons, including offi
cers of the Pacific Coast Commercial
Travelers' Association and the United
Commercial Travelers' Association, who
were the specially invited guests of the
host association. This was one of the
pleasant features of the reunion, as in the
past the spirit of unity that was noticed
last night has not always existed between
the several organizations.
In the absence of Henry M. Campe, the
president of the T. P. A., Harry E. Dig-,
gles acted as toastmaster, and while the
members and guests were discussing the
choice menu that was served, he called
upon those who had been selected to re
spond to the toasts of the evening. This
was a pleasant innovation on the old-time
custom of waiting until the menu had
been disposed of before calling for the
wisdom ami wit that usually is given on
like occasions.
E. J. Warnecke, first vice president, who
was the president of the evening, made a
brief address and then followed the fol-*
lowing toasts and responses: "The United
Commercial Travelers," O. E. Bolderman;
"The Pacific Coast Travelers," J. H. Pe
terson; "The Drummer as He Is," R. E.
Starr; "The Buckboard Traveler," D. Ed
wards; "The Travelers and the Railroad,"
Harry Bush of the Santa Fe road, also a
specially invited guest; "The Ladles, Al
tfiuWKh 'Absent, Always Thought Of," D.
V. Gelder. These were followed by ven
triloquism by Tommy Nichols, the baby
of the T. P. A., remarks by J. Frohm,
Andrew Hampell, the funny man from
Nevada, J. C. Eubanks, and stories such
as commercial men only can tell. Be
tween toasts an orchestra discoursed de
lightful music.
The officers of the California branch of
the T. P. A. are: Henry M. Campe, pres
ident; E. J. Warnecke, first vice presi
dent; D. V. Gelder, second vice president;
J. J. Baumgartener, secretary and treas
urer, and R. E. Starr. J. H. Cammetr, (J.
E. Diggles, Dwight Edwards, C. A. Janes,
F. Eggers, J. 11. Lange, George Marks
and J. C. Edwards, directors. The asso
ciation numbers two hundred and twelve
members, and It has a prospect of a con
siderable addition to its membership.
It is the purpose of the association to
give a banquet once a year for the pur
pose of having the members become bet
ter acquainted with each other and to ce
ment a friendship with kindred organiza
tions. The affair last evening was, on
that lino, a perfect success and it was
thoroughly enjoyed by all who partici
pated.
Feast of the Circumcision.
To thank God for all the benefits he
has tendered during- the past year a sol
emn thanksgiving service will be held at
7:30 o'clock this morning at St. Ignatius
Church. Rev. J. F. Frieden, S. J.. will
address the congregation, after which a
solemn Te Deum will be sung by the
ladies' and gentlemen's choirs. The serv
ices will be concluded with solemn bene
diction of the blessed sacrament. The
Feust of the Circumcision of Christ will
be celebrated to-morrow with solemn
high mass at 10:30 o'clock. The sermon,
appropriate to the occasion, will be de
livered by Rev. Henry Woods, S. J. The
same superb musical programme that
was rendered on Christmas will be re-
Eeated. In the evening at 7:30 there will
c 30lemn high vespers and a sermon by
Rev. Joseph Riordan of Santa Clara Col
lege. Solemn benediction of the blessed
sacrament will follow, and will conclude
the evening services In honor of the feast.

BOOMLET OF U. S. GRANT JR.
BULLA IS CONFIDENT OF IN
CREASED STRENGTH.
Major McLaughlin Signs No Appli
cation and Is Not Connected
With, a Patronage
Bureau.
Along in the afternoon yesterday Dan
Burns "showed up" at the Palace court.
As the "colonel" had been out of sight
many hours, the touts began to express
fear that he had transferred himself and
his Senatorial aspirations to Sacramento
without giving them notice of his depar
ture. It was said at the Palace last night
that the "colonel" had not declared his
intentions to become a candidate and that
the situation In this respect was un
changed.
Major Frank McLaughlin, chairman of
the Republican State Central Committee,
left the city yesterday afternoon for his
home at Santa Cruz. The major will go
from Santa Cruz to Sacramento, but will
usher in the new year before leaving the
seacoast. There were many callers at the
headquarters of the party In the Palace
yesterday afternoon who were anxious to
consult with the chairman of the com
mittee. Among them was Rev. Mr. Perry
of San Leandro, a stalwart Presbyterian,
who is a candidate for the position of
chaplain of the Assembly. He deeply re
f retted the major's departure and sought
udge Dibble for spiritual consolation and
a liitle political influence on the side.
A statement published a few days ago
in The Call wherein reference was made
to a patronage bureau of the Republican
State Central Clmmittee annoyed Major
McLaughlin, as it left the impression on
the minds of some people that he had in
dorsed applications for appointments to
office. In every instance where his in
fluence in this regard has been sought he
has declined to give it. He asserts that
he has not signed nor indorsed a single
application for the appointment of any
one to an office, and, moreover, he de
clares his intention to refrain from giving
indorsements.
State Senator R. N. Bulla was in the
city a few hours yesterday, but left for
Sacramento early in the evening. He does
not take a gloomy view of the Senatorial
situation, but on the contrary regards the
prospects for his own election as quite
promising. He Is confident that he will
develop strength as the balloting pro
gresses and that many members of the
Legislature who are counted as support
ers of other men will be found voting for
Bulla before the contest is finished.
U. S. Grant Jr. was at the Palace Hotel
yesterday, but was not besieged by mem
bers of the Legislature. He will soon
transfer himself and his Senatorial boom
let to the capital of the State.
It is said that Governor-elect Gage hap
decided to appoint Daniel Kavane, an old
and trusted friend, residing in Los Ange
les, to the position of Secretary of the
Board of Examiners. The office is one of
the most responsible in the gift of the
Executive.
Nothing new has developed in San Fran
cisco regarding the position of adjutant
Â«>neral. The number of applicants is le
ff on. The R-ossln goes that the Governor
elect has in mind an active National
Guardsman, but may decide in the end
to follow the example of Governors Per
kins, Markham and Budd and recognize
the Grand Army of the Republic.
A TRIBUTE OF RESPECT.
Labor Council Takes Action on the
Death of Its Late President,
S. L. Robbins.
The meeting of the San Francisco Labor
Council last night was brief. All are
apparently waiting for the influx of new
blood after the first of the year. A num
ber of unions which have hitherto been
unrepresented will then have delegates
present, and with a new set of officers
and new members it is expected that
something will be accomplished.
The council has just lost its president,
Samuel L. Robbins, and the following
resolutions were adopted, and will be
spread on the minutes:
Whereas, This Council has lost on December
IS by the death of Samuel L. Bobbins, its pre
siding officer; be it
Resolved, That the Council is deprived by
the death of Brother Robbtns not only of its
president but of a valuable member, one who
has beon a faithful and efficient worker in the
cause of organized labor, and whose loss will
be deeply regretted, not only for his qualities
as a union man, but as a personal friend; and
be It further .
Resolved. That this Council hereby extends
its .'arnest sympathy to the family and friends
of Brother Rnnhlns.
Broke. the Mint Record.
Christmas and the end of the year and
other conditions that put wings on the

THE WOOL TRADE.
A REVIEW OF THE YEAR IS9S AJv'D WHAT

The circular of Jacob Wollner says: "It Is !
safe to say t'.iat the wool trade will not be

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Dec. 30.â Bradstreefs Weekly
Review of the Stock Market to-morrow will
say: Increased participation by the public has
been the principal feature. Commission houses
have been active In the maricet, and while a
great deal of profit-taking has undoubtedly
occurred, the accession of new purchasers of
securities for speculative purposes has been
continuous. Fears that the marKet was cul
minating for the time being have found ex
pression, but on the whole the bullish temper
of the street and public Is undimlnished. The
favorable factors of the situation, such as the
volume of money In the country and the con
tinuance of increased railroad earnings, were
supplemented this week by a rise in grain
prices, due largely to increased foreign de
mands for our breadstuffs. Among the other
Incidents which tends to sustain speculative
confidence Is the fact that a general move
ment seems to be on foot among railroad com
panies to insist on the maintenance of the full
tariff rates after January 1. There are also
intimations of "deals" and coming dividends
which will have a eood effect on the position
of various properties, while above all Is ihe
idea that while the course of the market in the
last fortnight has evidently been In the nature
of a discounting of the January investment de
mand, the latter will still have sufficient force
to carry securities to a blgber level, lire

spective of what the growth and widening of
the speculative spirit may accomplish in the
same direction. The London market has been
more or less of a holiday character, but Ameri
can stocks were strong there and the foreign
participation was mainly on the bull side. In
fact, the fortnightly* settlement on the Stock
Exchange there disclosed exceptionally large
long holdings of our securities.
In our own market the activity of leading
interests in supporting and advancing their
securities has not been wanting, though to give
variety to the market some of the professionals
! showed a disposition during the week to take
the bear side for a turn. Under existing con
1 dltions and In view of the revived interest of
: the public, professional estimates of the outlook
generally point to a continuance of the rise
in prices for both stocks and bonds, tempered,
perhaps, by setbacks, an realizing temporarily
galns the ascendancy or the over-bought
state of the market invites reactions.

BRADSTREETS ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, Dec. 30.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say.
Holiday quiet In general demand, sustained
activity In Industrial lines, particularly iron
and steel, exceptionally large shipments of
goods on orders, liberal cereal exports and
specially heavy dealings in speculative mar
ket?, are features calling for notable mention
in the closing week of the year. Firmness in
price is likewise encouraging feature in most
staples. Wheat, though showing a reaction, is
higher on the week on large export clearances,
and other cereals are in sympathy. I'iglron de
mand crows, and prices for this product and
for Bteel rails, pteel billets, plates and wire
rods are all higher on the week, while the vol
ume of foreign demand for even finished metal
prjducts apparently increases as the year
draws to its conclusion.
Concisely stated, the reports received as to
the year's business in all sections of the coun
try point to an unprecedented volume ot do
mestic and export trade, whloh is. reflected in
bank clearances that break the high record of
IS;*2. The general Jevel of prices of staple se
curities at tho close of the year is at the high
est p. lint reached for five years past. Railroad
earnings exceed all previous years, and, finally,
there was a smaller number of failures and lower
liabilities than reported in any year for at least
five y&Ti past. These general results in the
country at large have been achieved, too, not
withstanding the outbreak and conclusion of a
foreign war, and in spite also of unfavorable
conditions of some industries, notably textile
manufacturing, which, combined with unfa
vorable weather early in the year and the low
est t>rice for cotton on record, exercised an
unfavorable influence. But tne close of the
year finds an improvement even in those direc
tions, and returns as to retail trade, and par
tkularly holiday business, are strikingly good
in all sections. Best reports as to distributive
trade naturally come from the grain-growing
sections of the country, whlcji were the first
to meet an improvement resulting from free
foreign demand for our cereals, but indications
are not wanting that this Improvement is
gradually percolating throughout the entire
business community, and coupled with unpre
eeuented expert trade in manufactured goods
and the fact that we are selling two dollars'
worth abroad for every dollar's worth we buy
renders possible the gains reported In distri
butive trade over 1807, ranging from 10 to 40
j.or cent, with likewise good exports from the
manufacturing centers, excepting the textile
industries already mentioned. The export trade
for the country for the year, as above inti
mated, is the heaviest ever known, and will
probably exceed $1,250,000,000 in value, thus
being nearly double the Imports. Our export
trade in manufactured goods. It must bÂ»
observed, is the heaviest ever known, and for
the first time in our country's history ex
ceeded the value of imports of similar goods.
There were 11.683 failures in the United States
In INS, involving liabilities of $141,137,117, a
decrease from 1897 in number of 11.2 per cent,
anil in liabilities 9.5 per cent. Compared with
ISM and 1895 the proportion of decrease shown
jp p.^ n larger. As compared with 1896 failures
were fewer by 23 per cent, and liabilities smaller
by 64 per cent. Decreases are also shown when
compareri with 1891. a year of large trade, but
of numerous costly failures, but compared with
1892 there is an Increase shown of 13 per cent
in number and 30 per cent in liabilities. The
tendency of failures toward the normal is illus
trated by the fact that the percentage of assets
to liabilities is the smallest reported since 1892,
and the annual death rateâ that is. the percent
| age of traders falling to those in businessâ is
likewise the smallest reported since the latter
year, being only 1.06 per cent, against 1.20 in
1897, 1.50 in 1*93. and 1.00 in 1R92. Unsatis
factory conditions in textile lines and some
large failures of banks and other financial
concerns account for the expansion in liabili
ties shown in those sections, while a larger
number of small failures in Pennsylvania and
In some of the Eastern States reflect poor trade
early In "the year ami dullness growing out of

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. Pee. 30.â R. O. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
The year has not only been one of victory, of
Important increase in territory and of incal
culable expansion of the Influence of the
! T'nited States among other nations, but has
| surpassed all other years In financial and In
, dustrlal results. The center of financial power
I has crossed the ocean. After paying debts of
j several hundred millions abroad and conduet
j ing a war to an honorable end, the country
is lending so many millions In Europe that
1 for the first time banks abroad look to New
i York to dictate the rate of exchange. Ex
i ports have been about 11,250,000,000, and the ex-
I cess over imports about $617,000,000, against
I J357.000.000 in 1K97. and in only two previous
j years has the balance risen to $300,000,000. In
no past calendar year have net imports of
| gold reach $7r>,f'nn,ooo. hut this year they have
; been about $140,000,000. November passed all
: previous months in value of produce exports
i but December has gone much beyond Novem-
I ber.
Power in the world's markets comes with a
demand for breadstuffs and other necessaries
never before equaled. Exports of cotton have
J been over 7.700.W0 bales, about 3,936,000.000
pounds, and In no previous year as much as
7,000,000 bales, or 3,500,000,000 pounds. Exports
of breadstuffs have been in value $283,918,294
In eleven months, and never have been as large
In any other year. Exports of wheat for the
year, lacking a day or two, have been 215,
694,686 bushels, flour included, slightly exceeded
only by 225,605.812 In 1892, and of corn 200,979,077
bushels, nearly approached by 189,217,570 in 1897.
The heaviest exports of both grain and flour
in any previous year were 59,000.000 bushels
smaller, only 360,220,513 In 1597. Though wheat
was raised to $1 91 in May. the highest quota
tion with the highest monthly average for
thirty years. 153.23, so that the average for
the first half year was 111.11, exceeded slightly
In 1891, but the highest since ISS3, the De
cember average has been only 72c, 25c below
that of last year, but the year's average, 93c,
the highest since ISSI.
The triumph in finance has been largely due
to Industrial progress. The output of plgiron
has been about 11,645,000 tons, the greatest yet
reached In any year by 2,000,000 tons and
greater than Great Britain ever reached by
2.800,000 tons. Yet the consumption In manu
facture has been still lareer In spite of net
exports of pig, in ten months, 183,039 tons. Ex
ports of iron manufactures in ten months were
about $87,644,538 in value, against Imports of
$13,497,817. Prices shown for the year in the
table of comparisons have been unusually
steady, varying not 5 per cent from the lowest
to the highest, and for finished products not
6 per cent. Textile Industries have been re
tarded by high prices of wool and abnormally
low prices of cotton, both deterring purchases.
In three months cotton re-acned 5.31 cents, the
lowest price for fifty years, the greatest yield
ever known being followed by receipts since
September 357,000 bales larger than last year.
Exports have increased, but not as greatly.
Toward the close recovery came with accounts
of some destruction by storms, and the price
reached 5.87 cents, giving a strong Impulse to
the manufacture, so the takings by Northern
and Southern spinners In the calendar year
have been 3,425,200 bales, a little greater than
any previous crop year. Goods were reduced
In price 5 per cent to the middle of Novem
ber, but have risen 7 >w cent and closed
at the highest point for the year. In spite
of enormous stocks held, wool was bo lifted
that buying both of wool and of goods was
checked early In the year, but a slow decline
began In February. Sales have been only
232,451,131 pounds at the thref chief markets,
so that the mills have probably used less than
a full year's supply, and the stock of goods
was also excessive a year ago.
Failures in the T'nltÂ»d States for the week
were 252, and in Canada 22. total, 274. against
289 last week. 292 the preceding week and 416
the corresponding week last year, of which
295 were in the United States and 21 in Can
ada. Of failures in the United States 74
have liabilities exceeding $5000 and 178 liabili
ties less than $5000. For four weeks of De- i
cember total liabilities of firms failing were
$11,697,605, against $10,366,586 last year.

CHICAGO GRALN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 30.â The opening- In wheat
was rather quiet, though a strong undertone 1
was shown, and this notwithstanding yester
day's weak closing. A tendency was shown
by many of the local bulls to dispose of their
lines pending the holiday recess and offer-
Ings from this source were sufficient at first
to satisfy, buyers. Diminishing country offer
ings had evidently affected outsiders, for com
mission houses were all well supplied with or
ders. May opened %@ftc higher at 70ft@7O%c. It
advanced quickly to 71VÂ»c, and by 11 o'clock
May was selling at 71% c. Around 71VsÂ« profit
taking sent the market down to 71*4 cby noon.
Hut added confidence was given buyers by
the closing Liverpool cables which showed an
advance, and in the last hour's trading May
reached 71% c, the highest point of the day.
A quick drop to 71'4c took place shortly before
the close, partly In sympatny with lake weak
ness in corn, but part of this was immediate
ly recovered, the market closing firm at 71% c
asked.
Corn was fairly active. The market was
firm at times with wheat, but in general It
snowed a tendency to lag, excellent shipping
demand also serving to susta:n . prices.
Oats were comparatively slow. There was
some- buying on the strength of wheat, but
offerings were as a rule ample and price
changes were narrow. It was mostly a
ecalper'p market. May gained VfelSVAc.
There was a large trade In provisions. The
outside demand was heavy and the market at
all times was firm and higher for lard. The
best prices were not maintained, longs taking
profits in the afternoon. At the close May
pork was 5c higher, lard 2ftc higher and rib 3
a shade higher.

Track Notes.
Jockey Johnny Woods' contract
with Burns & W.iterhouse will
expire next week. The boy will
not be re-engaged by that firm
on account of increasing avoirdupois.
However, if Johnny handles all of his
mounts in future as well as he did the
outsider Aluminum he will not be on
the ground much.
Twenty-one bookmakers weighed in

GREAT COURSING
AT
INGLESIDE PARK.
Three great days' eport will be wit
nessed at the Ingleslde Coursing Park
commencing to-day and ending on Mon
day.
The drawing, which was held on Thurs
day evening, proved beyond a doubt
the great interest that the leashmen arc
taking in the game, which shows no
signs of flagging.
At noon to-day the sport will commence
with the first round of the Sapling stake,
which has thirty entries, comprising
many of the fastest and most promising
youngsters representing the local ken
nels. Then will follow the Puppy stake
of twenty-four entries, and if time will
permit, both stakes will be finished to
day.
On Sunday, commencing at 10:30 o'clock
sharp, the great All-aged stake will .be
called. Seventy-two high-class grey
hounds, many of which have won laurels
on various coursing swards in this State,
will face the slipper, and as the royal
gamekeeper of the park Is authority for
the statement that the hares are "as fine
as silk" and anxious to enter, into a test
of speed with the dogs, the sporting peo
ple who will select Jngleside Park as the
place to see coursing at its best will cer
tainly not regret .having visited that pop
ular pleasure resort.
John ura-ce and his son James, the ex
pert slipper, are iceling splendid' after
their trip to Los Angeles, at which place
they enjoyed themselves immensely. In
speaking of his trip to the Angel City,
Judge Grace stated that in all his travels
he never enjoyed such pleasant hours as
th6se he spent among the royal sports
men of Southern California, and that
coursing was the sport which the Los
Angelas people have taken to with an
interest which surprised him.
President Shannon of Ingleside Park
will be the most disappointed man on
earth to-morrow if he should detect a
spare Inch of room in the grand stand or
betting ring.
"L know in my heart," said Mr. Man
non, ''that we will be pressed for room
to-morrow for the simple reason that ln
gieside has the greatest Now Year's cours
ing ( ard that has i vet appeared in -public
print, and if anything under the sun will
attract the lovers of tins grand old sport
to any , lie place it is an entry of first
class dogs who are evenly matched."
Captain Clarkson of the House of Correc
tion will not have the pleasure of seeing
Judge Grace mounted on his pet racing
to-day. The judge rode "Nancy
Till" last Saturday, but Nancy did not
understand the rules of coursing, and in
stead of making perfect turns*-!, c.,
when the <uiigÂ»Â» required her head
to the right or . left, as the case
may beâ Miss Nancy did not for
get her old racing days and Insisted on
going straight ahead and beating the
I i i in- escape.
Field Steward T. McHugh laughed until
ached when he saw the judge
dashing up the field in hot pursuit of the
dogs.
â¢\\"hy, man," said the Hon. Thomas. "I
hX that the race horse was
going to take the fence, and knowing
ludge to be a good old country
se rider I expected to see him,
all go flying over the timber,
but fortune favored the judge at the final
moment, as Nancy, being a native daugh
ter, suddenly changed her mind and
ed short. Mr. Grace now s.-iys that
in future be Will have nothing more to do
with fast stock, and that he will turn all
speedy racers over to his friend, Signor
Halpin."

LATEST DOINGS
IN YACHTING
CIRCLES.
Owing to the recent death of Edward B.
Lathrop, late secretary of the Corinthian
Yacht Club, the annual New Year's dinner
at the Tiburon boat house will be a quiet
affair. "Eddie" was a universal favorite
among the members, and was never ab
sent from any of the club gatherings.
Many of the Corinthian yachtsmen at
tended his funeral, and sent flowers as
tokens of their regard. His heart was in
the sport of yachting, and he was zealous
in the performance of his duties as secre
tary, which In a club so large and active
as the Corinthian often entail consider
able labor.
The nominating committee, consisting
of J. Short, ex-Commodores A. J. Young
and T. F. Tracy has nominated the fol
lowing to serve as officers o. the Corinth
ian club' during the year 1899. For com
modore, Carl Westerfeld, part owner of
the successful prize winner Aeolus; for
vice commodore, W. H. Toepke (of the
firm of Havens & Toepke, architects),
part owner of the sloop Harpoon; for port
captain, John H. Keefe; for directors. T.
L. Miller, of the yawl Spray; C. L. Bar
rett, E. F. Sager, of the sloop Edna, and
A. I. Lyons of the sloop Freeda. T. L.
Miller! will be elected secretary and C. L.
Barrett will be treasurer. These will
form a strong board of active, popular
yachtsmen, the offices of commodore,
treasurer and port captain being held by
the same men as last season fulfilled
their dutii-s to the general satisfaction.
Frank atone is working upon H. Simp
kins' new boat, which, with an over-all
measurement of 86 feet, ana a measure
ment on the water line of about 45 feet,
will be the largest yawl on the bay. Stone
& Swanson, the Tiburon boat builders,
also have under construction a yacht built
on the lines of \Y. O. Hall, who modeled
and constructed the schooner Aggie and
the swift sloops Nixie and Aeolus. She is
built of white cedar, with a keel of Ore
gon pine having two tons of lead bolted
to it. Her bow is of the spoon type, and
she is considerably cut away at the stem.
Her dimensions are as follows; Length
over all, 33 feet 4 inches; length on the
water line, 25 feet; beam. 1 feet 4 inches,
p:. Stone of Hunters Point is building a
yacht which is said to be for one of the
members uf the South Bay Yacht Club.
The South Bays will elect their new board
of officers later than the clubs around San
Francisco, Thursday, March 2, being the
day set.
One of the best known yachtsmen of
early days recently passed awayâ John L.
Eckley. "He came to this State In iwi and
was the agent of D. O. Mills and other
rich men at Saoramento. lie lived at Em
emkl Bay, Lake Tahoe, for some time,
and owned land there. He was an enthu-
Biastlc yachtsman, and often took part In
races before there were any organized
clubs or regular regattas here. In 1868 he
and J. C. Kelly built the yacht Emerald,
which won many matches and races in
regattas. He was one of the founders of
the San Francisco Yacht Club, which was
organized In 1873, and was its first vice
commodore; later he bpcame its commo
d >tp. When the Pacific Yacht Club was
founded in 1878 at Old Sausalito he became
its lirst commodore and a life member.
He owned the BChooner Pearl, which was
built from the designs of M. Turner, and
the schooner Harvest Queen. Though he
had retired from active business several
years ago he owned a half interest in the
shipyards at Benlcia and was interested
in other enterprises.

STEELHEADS ARE NOW
IN RUSSIAN RIVER
Yesterday the North Pacific Coast Rail
road Company received a dispatch from
Duncans Mills that the Russian River
bar is open and that the steelheads are
making good time up the river. If the
company will retain a sufficient force of
men near the mouth of the river In order
to keep the channel clear of drifting
sands anglers can certainly hope for gala
sport during the next week, as the large
fishes will certainly not wait on the order
of going but on the contrary they will
work their passage as high up the river
as it is possible for them to get. It is cer
tain, however, that unless a force of men
remain at the river's mouth the channel
that has just been completed will close
on the first heavy swell and keep filling
up until the blockade will be as bad as
ever. John Butler McFarland, John Gal
lagher and A. Wilson will leave for Dun
cans Mills to-morrow if reports continue
favorable.

GOLD MEDAL FOR
CHAMPION
OF CITY GOLFERS.
The men's championship match play of
the San Francisco Golf Club, which is
played for annually, reached the final
round on the day after Christmas day.
Lieutenant T. G. Roberts and H. Babcock
being the last pair left. These two will
play this afternoon, eighteen holes, and
the winner will be the San Francisco
Club's champion at match play.
On Monday the links will be the scene
of great activity. At 10 o'clock in the
forenoon the struggle for the men's cham
pionship medal play will begin on the
Presidio course. The winner will receive
the gold medal and the honor of being
the club's champion at medal play; the
second player will receive a silver medal.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the contest
will begin for the Liverpool silver medal,
which is offered each month for men,
medal play, each competitor receiving a
handicap based upon his recent play.
On Monday last, after the match be
tween the first and second teams of the
Oakland Golf Club had been played, an
informal tea was given at the clubhouse,
which had been prettily decorated in a
manner appropriate to the season. Next
day thirty-five of the caddies employed
by the club were entertained at a feast of
turkey, plum pudding, mince pies and
other good things. After dinner was
over each caddie received a present from
the Christmas trees and an all-round good
time was enjoyed.
Though no special event has been ar
ranged by the Oakland club for Monday,
many players will take advantage of the
holiday to practice.
Golf will be going on from 9 a. m. until
dark to-day on the course of the Los An
geles Country Club. The events open to
club members include a handicap for
men, 36 holes, medal play; a handicap

open competition for men, 36 holes medal
play; an open competition for women, IS
holes medal play; an open driving compe
tition for men, and also for women.
The last day of 1888 Is an appropriate
one for reviewing the g-olf of the past
year. The Rev. Price Collier, who is an
enthusiastic golfer, says that on the whole
the golf of IS9R in the TTnited States has
been better than tho golf of previous sea
sonsânot po much because there has been
any marked improvement, in the quality
of "the play, but because more people
have become golfers, and because the
same poems to be played with less wrang
ling and friction than formerly. He says
that at one time it looked a little as
though the semi-professional and the
trickster mlsrht get in and spoil tins good
irame as they have spoiled other good
sports, M^ baseball, racing, pigeon-shoot
ing and boxing, but that fortunately this
has not happened. There are moro and
better links than ever before, more pood
players, and better influences at work
to make and keep golf an honest sport.

ASSOCIATION FOOTBAuL.
Keen Game Between Oaklanders and
Vampires Next Monday at
Golden Gate.
The Vampire Association football play
era have lately been contenting themselves
with practice games, but on Monday,
January 2, they will play a match on the
Golden Gate ground, near Berkeley,
against the Oakland eleven. The Vam
pires and Oaklanders have met twice be
fore â on January 1, 1898, and on February
22. 1898. On the first occasion the Vam
pires were victorious by three goals to one;
on the second meeting the Oaklanders
won by three goals to none. The coming
game will, therefore, be the deciding one,
and both teams will do their utmost to
win. Judging by the play of both teams
against the Presidio eleven the game
should be an even and well fought con
test. The Vampires, after a very even
game, were beaten by the soldiers by one
goal to none, while the Oaklanders, with
a considerably weaker team than their
present one, were beaten by three goals
to none.
The Vampires will put their best avail
able eleven into the field and the Oakland
team, including as it dcx?s such veterans
as Percy Morse and Douglas Erskine of
the Olympic Club and Percy Chambers
of the Acme Club, is decidedly strong.
The game will begin at 2:30 p. m., and
the line-up is as follows:
Vampires. Position. Oakland.
J. M. Punnett.. Goalkeeper E. Pomeroy
McGuw Back Yon Helm
Robertson Back I,a!ng
Belwood Halfback Warren
Baugb Halfback Chambers
Croaaley Halfback Hunter

CREEDON WAS
SLOW TO HIT
AND PUNISH
Green Won in Twenty
Rounds.
A DECISION ON POINTS
CLEVER AND SCIENTIFIC BOX
ING FROM THE START.
Neither Pugilist Appeared Anxious
for a Knock-Out, Although Both
Did Some Pretty Foot
Work.
George Green won a decision from Dan
Creedon of Australia in a twenty-round
contest which took place in Woodward's
Pavilion last evening. Jack Kitchen of
the Reliance Club of Oakland acted as
referee, and under the rules of Queens
berry he considered that Green had the
better of the fistic argument. Still there
were several good judges of boxing pres
ent who thought that Kitchen would
have won a great feather in his cap if
he had ordered both of the men out of
the ring long before the twentieth round
was reached, as neither pugilist tried very
hard for a knockout.
As an exhibition of clean boxing, side
stepping, ducking, etc., the contest was
assuredly a success, but when the affair
is looked at in a .serious light it smacked
very much of the hippodrome, as Green
cannot, apparently, disguise his style of
lighting. Time and agaJn he swung his
left around the neck of his opponent
when he could have planted the glove on
Creedon's ear or jaw. Then there were
times during the game when George per
mitted excellent openings for right-hand
body punches to pass him unnoticed.
Then there were those motherly embraces
and little smiling chats between the fistic
acts which did not impress the spectators
seriously us to the genuineness of the
contest.
Creedon acted liko a man who had
grown muscle-bound from sack-lifting,
titill there is not any mention in his
record of athletic exercises where at any
time, he assisted to loud a tramp steamer
with California t-;ruin. Be that as it may,
Creedon's arms were very much tied and
slow Just evening. It may have been
that they were not out to win. At any
rate, Australian JJan is a very much over
rated pugilist or else he held back his
fire on Green, as he certainly had many
excellent chances of planting his auc
tioneer where good returns would follow.
But if Creedon had had an undi-rtÂ«andine
with some one who was on friendly terms
with his opponent prior to the game,
then it is not to be supposed that X>an - B
pile-drivers were intended to do bodily
harm.
Occasionally during the contest Creedon
planted some good swift right-hand
punches in Green's ribs, which were an
ace that the muscle-bound tactics he
employed were simply to deceive the
tators. His manner of guarding and
warding-off blows is very pretty and his
footwork is faultless, but his style of hit
ting, as shown last night, would cause a
San Francisco Athletic Club amuieur
boxer to blush for shame. Green certainly
landed the most clean blows, and the de
cision in his favor was fair, surmising
that the referee really thought that the
lighters had done their utmost to please
the audience.
Green was the first to enter the ring
âexactly at 9:3oâ accompanied by his sec
onds, Frank Foster, "Bob" McArthur and
"Patsy" Corrigan. Creedon followed di
rectly behind nim, with his seconds, Al
Smith, Tom Tracey, Frank McConneil
and "Jimmy" Riley. Green was introduced
by Announcer Billy Jordan as hailing
from San Francisco, and Creedon from
Australia. Both were greeted with an
eiiual amount of applause, and the adhe
rents of the men throughout the tight
were about equally divided.
Jack Kitchen, the popular boxer of the
Acme Club of Oakland, was chosen ref
er Â».â¢â¢-â .
Announcer Jordan also stated that Jack
Bonner of Philadelphia had telegraphed
a challenge to the winner of the Green-
Crcedon bout.
The men agreed to breakaway without
hitting in the clinches, and with one or
two accidental exceptions both kept this
agreement to the letter throughout the
tight.
When the men stood together in the
center of the ring arranging the details,
a comparison of their physiques was pos
sible, and it was apparent that Creedon
was slightly taller and somewhat heavier
than Green. But the fight afterward de
veloped the fact that Green had a much
more free use of his arms, and conse
quently a longer reach.
Throughout the tight Creedon's aim
seemed to be to corner his man and then
rush in with a left swing and right body
punch. Green showed much cleverness
in fitting out of these tight places, some
times by ducking and again by rushing
at his antagonist. The fight began ana
ended this way. In the opening round I
Creedon had Green dancing in the four j
corners of the ring at different times, but !
the wily Californian, by fiddling and duck- J
ing, managed to get away, only to be j
forced into another corner.
Both men fought with extreme care and
seldom left an opening, due as much as
anything to their cleverness. It would be
fiddle, duck, counter and clinch, repeated
time and again. Ocasionally each would
essay a rush, which was generally
blocked by the other. Green made many
a wild left swing and vicious uppercut,
but none of these blows ever landed. His
most effective punches were at close quar
ters, when he would plant his left or
right hard Into Creedon's body, and these
often made the Australian wince, but he
was game and ready for more.
It was anybody's fight up to the elev
enth round, with not much damage done,
but in that round Creedon scored a dis
tinct lead over Green, batting him about
at will. At close range the Australian
was at his best, and he swung his short
arms and chopped and planted straight
leads into Green until the Californian wa3
obliged to clinch. Of course, in such a
mix-i:p Creedon did not get off unscathed,
but another round like the eleventh would
have finished Green.
At no time did the fight border on the
sensational. Toward the end both the
fighters and the spectators were warmed
up, and the men took more chances with
each other, spurred on by the cheers of
the crowd. But even the last two rounds
did not amount to much, although Cree
don had the best of what there was to
them. He opened the nineteenth with a
â¢well-intended rush, but did not land.
Later he landed a light straight left on
the mouth, and then folowed it with an
other. Green rushed, and Creedon met
him with a right swing on the head.
(irt'en rushed again, this time getting in a
stiff left on the body and his right on
the head. Creedon ended the round by
planting his left hard in the stomach.
Green commenced the last round by
rushing at his antagonist, swinging his
left around Creedon's head. Creedon was
right there and rushed Green into sev
eral corners, from which he escaped by
clinching. Green then rushed Into a
straight left flush on the mouth. Cree
don rushed, swinging his left low into the
stomach. Green rushed Creedon across
the ring, landing his left In the body and
receiving a stiff right counter on the face.
Green missed a left swing for the head,
and tried an uppercut and missed. Cree
don landed a stiff left on the face at the
end.
Creedon nearly lost the fight on a foul
in the seventeenth. He tried a left upper
cut, and it landed way below Green's
belt, the latter yelling "Oh!" In pain. The
crowd cried "Foul!" but the referee did
not allow it, and Green was soon fighting
as fast as ever, mixing it with Creedon
as lively as cou'.d be wished for.
j The only time either man went down
was in the eighteenth, when Creedon
slipped in jumping away from one of
Green's rushes, and fell on his back.
Green did not land and it was not a
knock-down. The Australian was up in
a second.
Green Was Jubilant.
Green entered his dressing-room at the
conclusion of his fistic argument with
Creedon with delight written all over his
countenance. Not a blemish could be
neen on him, and he looked as fresh as a
daisy. He declined the attentions of his
trainers and, while receiving the congrat
ulations of his numerous following,
donned his street attire and left the
building. While dressing he said:
"Creedon is one of the strongest and
most dangerous men I have ever met. I
took no chances with him. I was there
to get the decision and not to show how
much punishment I could stand. Creedon
is not muscle-bound, and can hit good and
hard. His blows did not bother me at any
time, excepting the one he landed low
near the end of the fight.
"I would like to fight Tommy Ryan for
the middle-weight championship of the
world. Jack Quan of Vancouver is willing
to back me against him. He was my
backer when I fought Smith in New
York a few months ago. If McCoy could
get down to my weight I would be willing
to meet him. I will flight Bonner or any
other middle-weight. As to meeting
Creedon again, I need time to consider the
proposition. He is one of the hardest
men I have ever gone against, but hav
ing gained a decision over him I want to
take on some one else."
Creedon Not Complaining.
The dressing-room occupied by Cree
don seemed an unlucky one last night.
Mose La Fontlse and his trainers threw
a glamor of mourning over it with their
lamentations over the "unjust" decision
of Referee Murphy. Creedon seemed
undisturbed by their grief and prepared
for his encounter with Green as if vic
tory was already within his grasp. Even
after the twenty-round bout he seemed
undisturbed by the decision. He stated
that he was "not complaining, although
friends had informed him that like his
half brother, Tommy Tracey, he had been
"handed" one. He said that he would
like to get another show at his rival and
believed he could beat him.
"Green was a better man than I thought
he was. He is a strong and lively fellnw
and put up a good fight. I would have
done much better if I had more time to
train. Reducing my weight from 175 to
156 in so short a time weakened me. I
am sure if Green would meet me again
and I had four weeks to train. I would
defeat him In short order. My manager
is willing to deposit $1000 with your paper
to-morrow to bind a match with him.
I have nothing to say about the referee â  s
decison. Some of my friends think I was
banded one by him."
Referee Kitchen Satisfied.
Jack Kitchen, the boxing instructor of
the Reliance Athletic Club, who refereed
the fight, was well satisfied with the de
cision he rendered in Green's favor. He
stated he had kept a close tab on tha
fighters and thought hi 3 judgment
pleased right-minded persons.
"I gave Green a decision," he said, be
cause I thought he had a shade the bet
ter of the fight. It was any one's victory
up to the twentieth round, but after
weighing the work done by the contest
ants during the fight I thought Green
was entitled to it, he having delivered the
most clean blows. I seldom pay attention
to a fighter who swings wildly and does
the most rushing. The man who lands
the cleanest and greatest number of
blows is the one I favor. â,âââ
"Both men put up a good and clean
fight. I believe that Creedon, if he had
had longer to train, would haye done
much better. He Is a strong and willing
fighter and a hard one to land on. In ono
of the earlier rounds Green tried an up
percut for his body and he blocked wltli
hH right forearm. I thought George n;i. l
broken his arm. the Impact was so hard.
It must have hurt him, for he dldnot
try the same trick again. I did not g
Gf^en the fight on a foul to the seven
teenth round because I thought Creedon s
blow was accidental. Green deserved the
decision and .1 gave It to him.
Betting on the Game.
Slathers of "wise money" went up In
smoke when Referee Kitchen said "Green
wins." All day long the "men on the
know" hovered about Harry Corbett's
poolroom and gave the "low down" to
each other. All sorts of stories were set
afloat regarding the probable outcome of
the contest. Everybody was willing to
believe that there was a "nigger in the
woodpile," but just where nobody seemed
to know. The local boxer remained a
favorite in the betting throughout tho
day but along toward evening a wad of
"w*ise coin" with a mythical string to it
was dropped into the box and Green s ad
mirers got as good as even money. Just
before ring time Creedon went favorite.
Ten to eight were the prevailing odds.
Green on the short end. The sudden
switch in the betting was the result of
a "gold brick" in the shape of a strong
tip on Creedon that was passed out by
bettors who are supposed to know just
when, where and how a pugilistic en
counter is to be ended. Every "doubting
Thomas" who frequents the poolrooms
handled the gold brick, passed it to his
friends and soon Creedon was being
played heavily by every "sure thing" man
in town. Enough "wise money went on
Creedon'a chances to weight a balloon.
Tye's Plucky Battle.
Charley Tye was awarded a decision
over Mose La Fontise after ten rounds
of lunges, plunges and wild swings. Mose
was far cleverer and faster than his oppo
nent but his propensity to hit in clinches
and habit of waiting for Tye to lead lost
him a battle that he should have won. La
Fontise had every advantage over Tye.
They were scheduled to fight at 130
pounds, but La Fontise forgot to come to
weight and went into the ring weighing
in the neighborhood of 144 pounds. Tye
conceded this advantage and went in and
put up a plucky battle. He met the Mon
tana man's onslaught with straight lefts,
but was buffeted around the ring through
out the bout.
Referee Jimmy Murphy cautioned La
Fontise at various stages of the fight not
to hit his man in the clinches and the
crowd also warned him of his bad break
by hissing him. La Fontise proved him
self a clever two-handed fighter, but a
poor judge of distance. In the early
rounds he landed hard and often on Tye,
but without inflicting much damage. In
the last few rounds Tye began to show
signs of punishment. The cheers of his
friends led him to exert himself and he
began to set the pace. La Fontise met him
with wild swings that wound around hts
neck, doing little harm. The last round
was of the hurricane order. Mose rushed
and landed repeatedly on the Oakland
scrapper and had him somewhat tired.
but he lasted the round.

REPUBLICAN
COMMITTEE TO
MEET MONDAY
Opinions Differ as to
Methods.
PRIMARY MAY BE ORDERED
MUNICIPAL LEAGUE TO TRY TO
GET AHEAD.
IPhe Populists Are Discouraged,
but the Democrats Still Show
Some Signs of
Life.
I Oakland Offic? San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, l.'tv. :;o.
The Republican <ity Central Commit
tee will hold an important meeting next
Monday night. The committee has kjr
nified its Intention of at once opening
Jieaduarters and .â : Inaugurating the Re
publican campaign ahead of any other
party.
There is some difference of opinion
among prominent Republicans who are
eomewhat in favor of Municipal League
methods regarding the manner in which
the League should proceed. 11. D. Rowe,
a Councilman, whose name may be con
sidered as available for the nomination
lor Mayor, makes this statement:
"I do not think the Municipal !-â¢
should go ahead and make nomination?
until after the other parties have made
their selections. Then it may be time
for the League to a<t. There are many
good men who run be nominated by the
Reublicans and elected, 1 believe, if the
League forestalls the Republican conven
tion by nominating sunn' of the candi
dates who might be favored by Republi
cans it is more than possible thai the
convention will seek other nun. in other
â words, the nomination of a man by the
Municipal League at this lime might
shut him out of the Republican conven
tion altogether. Whereas, if the League
â waited to make indorsements, it would
very readily deride upon bne of the nom
inees of the other parties, and. if none
suited, choose some "tie else, l am al
ways in favor of maintaining Republi
can organization."
Giles H. Gray, who would not object to
being Mayor and who is one of the lead
ers of the Municipal l^eui;ue. -ays the
League would make a great mistake if it
should wait until after tli. political par
ties have made nominations. He says,
however, that if honest Republican pri
maries could be guaranteed lie would ask
for no'hing better.
A few of the Populists got together last
night and decided to hold a mass-meet
ing next week to discuss the coming city
election. The sentiment then expressed
â will determine whether the Populists
shall or shall not put a tlckei in the fleld.
Most of the party leaders have drifted
back to Republicanism, and with the posi
tive statement of the Democrats that
there will be no fusion, the Populists uiv
somewhat dlscouragi <!
The idea is growing that Warren B.
English will be late of the De
mocracy for Mayor, it is regarded as
significant that W. B. English was chair
man at the meeting of taxpayers in the
Fifth Ward a lew Mights ago that nom
inated Frank M. Parcells as a candidate
for the Council.

REFUSED TO
EXPUNGE AN
INDICTMENT
I Last of the Gold-Brick
Swindlers.
MOTION TO DISMISS DENIED
STIPULATION TO DROP GORDON'S
CASE IS BROKEN.
Yet "Big Toot Dave" Will Probably
Not Be Tried When He Is
Released From San
Quentm.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 30.
When Charles Gordon, alias "Big Foot
Dave," prince of gold brick swindling
fame, was sentenced on October 15, 18%,
to spend ten years in San Quentin on con
viction sf beating Hanker Stephen G. Lit
tle of Dixon out of $7500, it was stipulated
that the other indictment of grand lar
ceny, in swindling Farmer Jacob Hofstra
of Santa Clara out of $10.<mk). should re
main on the docket three years and then
be stricken off.
Gordon's attorneys appeared before
Judge Greene this afternoon and moved
that the indictment be dismissed in ac
cordance with the stipulation, but Judge
Greene denied the motion.
There was still another charge against
Gordon, that of swindling Banker Ritchie
of Xapa out of $6UOO, but this was knocked
out in the foliie Court long ago.
I'nder the credit system Gordon has
about thrte years more to serve, but
whether or not the Hofstra swindle be
stricken off the criminal docket will make
very little difference to Gordon, for Hof~
Btra died about a. year ago, and his testi
mony, taken secretly before the Grand
Jury, could not be used at the trial.
At the time of Gordon's trial for the
Little swindle Mrs. Gordon, in a letter,
almost convinced everybody that her hus
band at the time of the alleged crime was
in a jail in New York. She, moreover,
wrote that the men implicated in the Lit
tle swindle had all been made wealthy
through Gordon, who was the kingpin of
the most celebrated gold brick outfit ever
in this country, and thai they bad de
serted "Big Foot Dave" in the hour of
need.
Gordon's connection with the Hofstra
swindle, however, was so clear that the
defense played for time, not wishing to
reach trial on that indictment. Hence
Gordon took his sentence.
Andrew Root, Gordon's accomplice,
whose part in these swindles was that of
an assayer, and who was also arrested
at the time, was released on $~M> bonds
and he escaped to parts unknown. Ray
mond, the last of the trio, whose role in
the gigantic scheme was that of an "In
dian." whilst 1 father on his deathbed had
disclosed the location of the mine of
"gold bricks." also got away.
A bunt a year ago Raymond was cap
tured in Dcs Moines, lowa, in the com
pany of Root. There he secured bonds
men when he heard that the Oakland
authorities were still pursuing him and
again he disappeared.
Just how much the trio ever realized
from their operations here was never
learned. Their scheme was considered
very clever at the time. They worked
from rooms in the Metropole, where Gor
don made his headquarters. The alleged
gold mine was located in the mountains
back of Mountain View Cemetery, and
was in charge of "Indian" Raymond.
Their plan was to take a victim to the
hidden treasure, give him some gold til
ings and then escort him to "Assayer"
Root, whose assay would convince the
most skeptical.
SLUKAM MAY BE THE
HERO OF A ROMANCE
SPICY MORSEL STIRS GOSSIPS AT
ELMHURST.
Joe Burnham's Warm Friendship for
Mrs. Seward Lands Him
in Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 30.
Back of the arrest of old "Joe Slu
kam" on a charge of disturbing the peace
at Mrs. Lulu Seward's home at Elm
hurst last Tuesday is a spicy morsel of
romance.
Slukam turns out to be Joe Burnham,
an interesting character of Elmhurst and
Shawsville, and to-day Joe Martin, the
gardener he attacked at Mrs. Seward's
place, placed a charge of battery against
him. At the time of the arrest Burnham
presented a sorry sight as a result of an
attack with a pitchfork in the hands of
Martin. Captain Gardiner of Shawsville
hailed him out on the ilrst charge, but
now the battery charge has again caused
his incarceration.
Xow it appears that Mrs. Seward, who
some three weeks ago discharged Burn
ham as her gardener. is anxious to get
him out of the State. She has visited him
at the County Jail and takes a deep in
terest in his case. Burnham, however, is
not anxious to go beyond the State line,
and admits that a warm friendship exists
between Mrs. Seward and himself. He
says, furtnermore, that his present
trouble was caused through an , act of
kindness he did for her which aroused the
jealousy and anger of Martin, his suc
cessor.
Every effort is being made to suppress
the little romance which is believed to
be hidden behind Burnham's troubles,
and anxious ears are pricked for the trial,
which promises food for gossips of the
usually quiet town of Elmhurst, where
Mrs. Seward has resided for some time
apparently possessed of plenty of means
to conduct a very comfortable establish
ment.

MANY SISTERS
PROSTRATE AT
HYMEN'S ALTAR
Wave of Matrimony
Strikes a Corps.
SECRETARY LAND'S LAMENT
PRETTY SALVATIONISTS ABE
TAKING HUSBANDS,
Half a Dozen Bonnets Less and a
Prospect That Many Engage
ments Will Mate
rialize.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
I 908 Broadway, Dec. 30.
"Unless some more sisters join our j
! corps, we shall soon be without a bonnet i
jon the march." Thus mused Secretary j
Land of the Oakland Corps of the Salva- j
tion Army at one of its executive gather- '
ings this week. There is much foundation
to the elderly secretary's remark.
A wave of matrimony has swept over
the Oakland corps during the past few
weeks, and its tendency is to Increase
its Influence rather than to diminish it.
A year ago it was remarked that there
were more pretty faces surrounded by
hallelujah bonnets in Oakland than in
any other city in the State. This state
ment made now would be an awful un
truth.
Last Monday night Sergeant Major Eu
gene Brown, one of the oldest officers in
this city, was married to Miss May Hum
phreys of the local corps. Sergeant Major
j Brown inaugurated the work among the
! convicts at San yuentin, and has per
i haps one of the most interesting corre
spondences of any officer in the army, i
i For the past year he lias been one of the |
â  most active officials at the Fort Romie ;
colony near Soledad. Miss Humphreys
has been for some years with the army.
To-morrow night Sister Lily Melville,
who has for years been a very active
little worker in the cause, and especially
: in jail work, will become the wile of
Herbert Moseley. an ex-officer, but now '
' a private in the army at Riverside.
A few weeks ago Miss Pearl Underwood
i of Berkeley resigned from the local corps .
to marry Mr. Camp of Fresno, where they ;
now reside. A marriage license was taken :
; out yesterday by Miss Hattie M. Starr,
1 who was formerly one' of the most ener
getic of Salvationists, to wed Albert Clay
ton I'latt.
The effect of these happy examples Is
such that several engagements are on the
tapis and more weddings are daily ex
pected.
And this is why Secretary Land strokes
j his long gray beard and mourns that
I volunteers to Jill the places of the absent
ones do not come forward.
DEFENDS HER SISTER.
Mrs. A. B. Andrews Discusses the
Actions of Mary Holden.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 30.â Mrs. A. B. An
drews, who was reported in this morn
ing's Call as having received a letter re
vealing the whereabouts of her sister,
Mrs. Mary Holden, who disappeared from
here last August, consented to-day to
make a statement for publication. Airs.
Andrews said:
"My sister left California immediately
after she disappeared frnm'Alameda, and
she has been outside of the State ever
since. I am not at liberty to say where
she is at present. We have beard from
her through friends, who are looking out
for her welfare. The poor woman, dis
tracted by her financial troubles, did at
tempt to "take her life, as she said she
would in the note she left, but fortu
nately she was prevented from carrying
out her Intention by friends who discov
ered her purpose, and they have been car
ing for her ever since.
"There have been all kinds of rumors
.-'.float about the tangle in which she left
Thomas Smith's affairs. This has been
greatly overrated. She had been led tv
make "ventures in the stock market and
lost her money. She borrowed more, and
Mr. Smith indorsed some of her notes.
Besides the holders of the notes otner
creditors of mv sister have asked Mr.
Smith to pay their claims on the ground
! that they trusted her because she was
| his bookkeeper."
These other creditors made efforts to
! day to learn the present address of Mrs.
I Holden, for the purpose of resorting to
I the law to have her brought back to Ala
meda.
While Mrs. Andrews, her sister, states
', she is not in the State and that no direct
communication has been had with her,
j other members of the family tell an en
tirely different story to the effect that the
woman is in Humboldt County, and would
return to Alameda if she were not afraid
I of the action her creditors might take.

FINDS DEATH IN
REFORM WORK
George Bloom King Is
Mortally Wounded.
SHOT DOWN BY A WOMAN
HAD TRIED TO CHANGE HER
MODE OF LIFE,
The Victim Chief Deputy City En
gineer of Los Angeles and a
Well-Known Poli
tician.
Sceclal Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 30.â George
Bloom King, Chief Deputy City Engin
eer, was mortally wounded by a woman
known as Mabel Kerr, in the rotunda
of the City Hall, at 7 o'clock to-night.
King is well known in political and so
cial circles, and has been employed in
the City Engineer's office for a long
period. He is a son of Judge A. J.
King, who is a pioneer of California,
having resided in this section for thirty
years.
King took the woman from her abode
and endeavored to reform her. What
led up to the shooting is unknown, as
none of King's associates were aware
of his consorting with the woman. The
shooting is best tc/id in the words of
f. M. Hickman, the colored janitor,
who says:
"When I came on duty at 6 o'clock
this evening 1 saw a woman standing
in the hall near the head of the stairs.
She asked me if every one had left the
building. 1 said no, and gathered up
a few of my tools. When i came back
iru-m the room where my brooms were,
the woman had disappeared, but her
strange actions aroused my suspicions,
and 1 walked down the corridor on the
other side of the floor. She was in the
dark part of the hall, but the windows
across the light shaft gave her an op
portunity to look into the office of the
City Engineer. She disappeared again,
ana when 1 next saw her she was hid
behind a pillar which supports the
staircase. 1 went about my work for
twenty-nve minutes, but her actions
worried me so 1 returned to see what
became of her. She had gone to the
same window in the dark part of/ the
hall, and after peering through it re
turned to the pillar and concealed her
self. I went into the office at the head
of the short stairs, and as 1 closed the
door I heard a heavy slam. 1 listened
for sounds, but not a word was ut
tered until the pistol shot rang out. I
rushed out and saw King sinking to
the floor and the wo-man bending over
him, endeavoring to put her revolver
under her cloak. She shrieked, 'Don't
let him die. If it was only myself and
not him. I did not mean to shoot him â
the revolver went off as I tried to shoot

DISSENSION
AMONG THE
DIRECTORS
Five Members of the New
School Board Threaten
to Resign.
Stow, Holbrook, Stafford, Eells and Brand
enstein Will Not Countenance the Job- â¢
bery Which They Fear Is
on Foot.
WHILE the outgoing Board of Ed
ucation is devoting the closing:
days of its official career to such
barefaced jobbery as to cause a
member of the Superior bench to publicly
express the wish that the reign of the
Vigilance Committee might be re-estab
lished, a majority of the incoming board
has outlined a plan of procedure which,
If carried out, promises to result In a
oontlnuance of the present scandal.
, This plan, if it is persisted In, will have
the effect of driving five members out. of
the board who are opposed to debauch-
Ing the Public School Department, for
they have declared, so it is stated by
their friends, their intention of resign
ing at once unless the majority manifests
an Inclination to be honest.
This is the situation as it stands at
present. Shortly afu-r it was definitely
known who the twelve men comprising
the new board were a caucus was held,
at which it was decided that Vanderlynn
Stow should be the president. Mr. Stow
'Is a man of experience in the commercial
â¢world, but he is a novice in the art of
politics, and to his Inexperience in that
line is due the miscarriage of his plans
for the honest administration of the de
partment for the coming term. Mr. Stow
Is of unblemished reputation, and he
knew of four i.ther numbers in whom he
could place at ~ iiut<- confidence. They
â¢were H. M. Holbro<ic, Charles P. Eels, W.
G. Stafford and H. L T . Brandensteln, Ke'.ls
a^id Brandens:ein being the only two
democrats elected.
Stow, with the innocence due to his in
experience in the political arena, accepted
this informal action of the caucus as tan
tamount to hi:- election to the presidency,
and proceeded forthwith to make up his
committees. hat would have been all
â¢well enough :ad he been possessed of
sufficient political sagacity to keep the
(natter to hi self until after the board
hail formally organized; but he lacked
that qualification, and it was not long be
fore the other members knew just what
he was doing Mr. Stuw did not hesitate
to t-i. 9 actions, if he did not say
it in bo many words, that he did not
place the majority on the same plane as
r'a wife â above suspicionâ and so in
making up :is list he took pains to have
all the in;; <rtant committees in control
of the :" iv member! besides himself, in
he placed full fauh, with just
ii of the others distributed among
to fll them out. The chairmanships
of the mi.-.or committees were given to
the seven, and Stow rested secure in the
belief tha: he had so arra iged matters
â¢ here could be no possible chance of
J arising.
Mr. Stow soon learned his mistake.
The majority were not slow in letting him
into a few tricks of the profession,
among others being that an informal cau
â â¢â¢' ision was the easiest thing in the
world to reverse. Stow an"d his four con
freres were dubbed the "'club flush,"
and it was to beat that hand that the
majority bent its energies. They were so
successful that a pair of deuces would
have been top hand, for the flush was
made a bobtail by tho desertion of Hol
brook to the majority, giving them tne
requisite two-thirds majority and abso
lute control of the board.
Stow and the others were shocked be
yond measure at the duplicity of Hol
brook. at any rate they professed to be.
but later developments would indicate
that they had proven apt pupils in the
political school and had progressed even
further than the majority cared to have
thorn.
At all events Holbrook openly joined
forces with the majority and was made
an honored member of its secret councils.
But Holfcrook had not surrendered to the
allurements of the practical politicians,
even though he would have it appear bo
for the time being. It was essential that
the schemes of the majority should be
come known, so he undertook that means
of ascertaining them.
Another caucus was held on the even-
Ing of December 21, at which only tne
solid eight were present, including Mr
Holbrook, and during that one session
ithat gentleman gained a clearer insight
Into the "practical" workings of machine
politics than he -would had he delved
along with a hopeless minority for his full
term. Orders form the bosses were
taken up, discussed and agreed to with a
freedom that was startling to the
novice, while Stow and his followers were
burled under an avalanche of abuse. It
was evident before the meeting was an
hour old that the majority was pre
pared to "do business" of almost any de
scription; this became conviction by the
time of adjournment. But Mr. Hol
brook manfully filled his part, and as a
Reward for his supposed desertion he was
riven the chairmanship of the Finance
Committee because of his known ability.
Bergerot was decided upon as president
of the board in place of Stow, and all th>
committees were made up according to
the majority's ideas of the fitness of
things. Needless to say that Stow and
the other three were relegated to the
places Stow had given to the seven in his
[let.

nority in the present boardâ his enemies

and the flush lost.
The new board will be inducted into of

the present programme is carried out

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 31, IS9B.
DR. YOORSANGER PROPOSED
FOR BERKELEY'S PRESIDENT
WHILE Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger
has said nothing publicly with
reference to the proposition of
his name for the exalted posi
tion of president of the University of
California, his friends discuss the sub
ject in an interesting and logical man
ner. First as to his attitude in not
seeking the place: second, his qualifi
cations, and third, the duty he owes
to the calling he now honors. As to
his abilities, all concede that he pos
ssea all the qualities and learning that
are requisites of such an office. The
question arises as to whether, if calk 1
upon, he would abandon the career i._
which he has met with such marked
success. In speaking of the momen
tous matter last evening one of
Rabbi Yoorsanger's most intimate as
sociates, a rabbi, said:
"Of course, it is known that the uni
versity has been for some time look
HER MOTHER DID NOT
MEAN ALL SHE SAID
Young Herman Westerfeld Jr. and Zelda Ray
mond Elope at a Parent's Word, but
Are Stopped at Stockton.
HERMAN WESTERFELD JR., a
son of Herman Westerfeld, one of
the proprietors of the Potrero
Yeast and Vinegar Company, 230
Kenrny street, and Miss Zelda Raymond,
residing at 1033 Golden Gate avenue, de
cided that fate intended that their lives
and fortunes should be cast together.
This decision was arrived at about one
year ago, but as they were only 18 and 15
years old respectively the mother of the
young lady thought otherwise. The
chains of love which bound their hearts
together would not loosen, however, and
their brains were set to work weaving
out devices by which they could surmount
parental objections. According to the
young man's story he threatened elope
ment on several occasions, and the moth
er stoutly Informed him that she cared
little what course he pursued. It Is re
ported that about four days ago they
took advantage of Mrs. Raymond's In
difference and sought to leave the city
and its troubles far behind. This attempt
was frustrated by the appearance of
Westerfeld Sr., who captured his son's
valise and turned his footsteps homeward.
Thursday afternoon the trend of events
ran more in their favor, and they were
successful in taking passage to Stockton
unhindered. Their honeymoon ended
abruptly yesterday morning, notwith
standing their precautions, when a police
officer, acting under Instructions from
this city, arrested them and detained
them In the private office of Chief Gall.
]>Ast evening the father of the boy tele
graphed a request that- they be returned
to San Francisco, and Captain Kings
bury of Stockton left with them on the
afternoon train. Upon their arrival here
both were taken to the central station
and the young lady was placed In charge
ing for a successor to ex-President
Kellogg, but it must be understood
that Mr. Voorsanger was not respon
sible for the proposition of his name to
the Regents, nor is he to be regarded
as n declared candidate for the place,
As a matter of fact, it is to be ques
tioned whether or not he would accept
Jt unless he should be convinced that
it was a public duty. Then I believe

"It should be remembered that
Rabbi Yoorsanger has for the past
twenty-five years devoted all his

that he has won a proud position in
his chosen calling. At the same time

of the matron of the prison. Young Wes
terfeld made the following statement:
"1 have been going with the girl over
a year. I asked her mother's consent to
marry her some time ago, but she told
me to wait a while. I guess she wanted
to see if I meant business. I told her at
the time that if she would not let us get
married that we would run away. This
statement only caused her to reply that
she did not care what we did. I asked
her mother again on Sunday, and she
made the same response, so we took her
at her word. I met the girl at 1 o'clock
yesterday afternoon and we made some
purchases around town. I packed up my
duds and sent them to the wharf and
then took one of the river boats. When
we started we did not know where we
were going. We just wanted to get out
or the city long enough for the thing
to blow over, after which we intended to
return and settle down."
Westerfeld claimed that they were mar
ried before they left this city and regis
tered on the Dauntless Thursday night
as H. Stone and wife. They evidently
intended returning to the city, as they
had engaged the same stateroom for the
return trip of the boat last evening.

To the Secretary, Board of
Begents, IT. C, Berkeley,
Cal. â Dear Sir: As one of the
alumni of the University of
California, class of '68, I feel
that it is not presumptuous
for me to suggest a nomina
tion for the presidency, now
vacant. I will suggest the
name of Dr. Jacob Voorsanger
of San Francisco, and request
that the name may be referred
to your special committee ap
pointed to consider che sub
ject. If given an opportunity
to do so I will undertake to
explain my reasons with,
pleasure, believing as I do
that both the State and the
university would be benefited
by the election of the doctor,
if he can be prevailed upon to
accept. Yours respectfully,

to acknowledge receipt of your
letter of the 27th inst., and
will say that the same will bo
placed in the hands of the
special committee on the Be
lection of a president of the

"Wher It 1b considered that he is
the honored and beloved leader of one
of the wealthiest and most Influential
congregations In our country and has
rich promise of a wider career, it
can be realized how hard It would be
for him at this time to change radi
cally the course of his life and en
gage in a secular pursuit, no mat
ter how splendid the position
might be.
"Notwithstanding his attainments. I
believe he would be frigi.i-ened if
called upon to enter the duties of an
exacting office. Still, while realizing
the varied requirements of the presi
dency of that famous institution, I
am confident that if the burden were
placed upon him he would be found to
possess the necessary learning, execu
tive and diplomatic ability to conduct
the office with honor to the State and
himself."
FLYING FROM
AN OLD CHARGE
OF FORGERY
Police Searching for
Harry Luke.
HE IS WELL CONNECTED
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEACHED
THIS CITY.
His Whereabouts Disclosed by a
a Letter Received From Him
by One of His Cred
itors.
Chief Lees yesterday received a dis
patch from the police of Butte City,
Mont, asking him to arrest Harry Luke,
who, with his wife and child, arrived here
Beveral days ago. Luke is wanted for
forgery.
The police of Butte City are very anx
ious to get him, and have wired Chief
Lees to spare no expense in running him
down. From this the police here are sat
isfied that Luke is wanted on more than
one charge of forgery.
Last night the following dispatch con
cerning him was received from Montana:
BUTTE, Mont., Dec. 30.â Harry Luke is
wanted In Butte for forging the name of Hon.
William Owsley to a note for $75. Young Luke
belongs to a well-known and prominent family
In Helena. A few months ago he came to
Butte and shortly after his arrival he sold a
note to Abe Itkin, a pawnbroker. The note
was for only $75, ran for sixty days, and bore
the well-known name of Mr. Owsley, in addi
tion to that of Luke. When it became due
Luke had disappeared and Itkin asked Owsley
to pay It. Owsley pronounced his name on the
note a forgery, but Itkin brought suit against
him In a justice court and Mr. Owsley again
denied that he had any knowledge of the note
and did not sign it. Itkin lost the case and
then placed the matter in the hands of the au
thorities and they have been looking for young
Luke. The fact that Luke Is well connected
and comes from a prominent Helena family
has made the case of more interest than the
amount involved in the forgery would other
wise have created.
Luke had been in the Insurance business in
Butte for some time before he committed the
forgery. It appenrs that he got the best of
several other parties In Butte for various
amounts and It is said that he has been kept
out of trouble before on account of his family.
The fact that he Is In San Francisco was dis
closed yesterday by a letter received from him
by one of his creditors.
â  The Holiday Wasp.
In bright new colors the Wasp observes
the advent of the new year. Its cover de
sign is particularly artistic. The regular
contributions of jokes and sketches line
its pages, in addition to special New
Year's features, with full-page cartoons
In several colors. A musical review of the
year is made by R. A. Lucchesi, the thea
ters are commented upon in light and un
conventional strain, and Teresa Doane
contributes a few New Year's reflections
culled from the society notes of twelve
months. Announcement is made that the
Wasp for the ensuing year will be more
pretty and succinct than ever, and the
greetings of the season that it extends to
its readers will, It is to be hoped, be cor
diaJly returned. Prosper the Wasp for '99.

SHANNON WILL
HAVE TO FIGHT
FOR HIS LEGACY
Squabble for A. M.
Wickes' Property.
UNDUE INFLUENCE INTIMATED
THERE ARE TWO WILLS AND
TWO LEGATEES.
Mrs. J. G. Clark as President of the
King's Daughters Will
Contest Shannon's
Claim.
When Mrs. A. M. Wickes died at Fabio
la Hospital on November 5 of this year,
and five days later her will was filed for
probate, the reading public of Oakland
and San Francisco was surprised to find
that J. M. Shannon, her attendant physi
cian at the hospital, was made the sole
legatee of an estate that exceeded $50,000
in value. That is but a single portion of
the story, the most interesting and sen
sational incidents of which will soon be
aired in court. Before Dr. Shannon Is
vested with the title to the property be
queathed him he will be forced into a le
gal battle by Mrs. J. G. Clark, the well
known philanthropist of this city and the
president of the King's Daughters.
Mrs. Clark is also a claimant to the
same property, but under a different will.
one made and executed by A. M. Wickes,
who for four years preceding his demise,
which occurred on December 24 last, was
an inmate of the King's Daughters' Home
in this city. He bequeathed nis entire es
tate consisting of 640 acres of fertile land
in Fresno County, valued at $S5 an acre,
to Mrs. J. G. Clark as president of the
King's Daughters. Which of the two
wills the law will determine valid is a
question for judicial solution, over which
perhaps the courts of both Oakland and
San Francisco wili be obliged to labor.
A. M. Wickes, who was 62 years of age at
the time of his death, was for a long time
clerk of the Grand Hotel. He was frugal
and saving, putting aside a portion of his
earnings for real estate investment. The
f4O acres in Fresno County are valued at
$f>4,400, the management of which passed
to Mrs. Wickes when her husband bought
a life entrance to the King's Daughters'
Home four years ago. The reason of his
desire to become an inmate was that he
suffered from loeomotor ataxia and
wished constant attention. At no time
did he show any lapses of mind or indica
tions of insanity.
In September of this year Mrs. Wickes
became ill and entered Fabiola Hospital
where Dr. J. M. Shannon attended her
It appears that she was desirous of join
ing her husband at the King's Daughters'
Home and had made an application to
Mrs. Clark with that intention. Mrs
Clark wrote to the Fabiola physician
inquiring about the nature of Mrs
Wickes' illness, but received no reply, and
the wife of the old hotel clerk remained
at the hosnital.
"On October 5," said Mrs. Clark yester
day afternoon, "I visited Mrs. Wickes at
the hospital. I found her in a wretched
mental condition. She grasped me in her
arms, crying: 'He's got it all: he's got it
all now. I couldn't help myself. What

-will poor Wickes do?* It was on this date
that she signed the will which left the
property to Dr. J. M. Shannon.
"At any rate Dr. Shannon will not g-et
the money. Mr. Wickes died after his
wife and, even admitting that the proper
ty was controlled by her while he was an
inmate of the home, it reverted to him
upon her death. The property was be
queathed to me for the benefit of tho
Home and I think the courts will settle it
that way. For four years I was a devoted
friend to Mr. WicKe's, and he always
said that I was to have the estate. The
matter is now in the hanus of my attor
ney. The hearing for the probate of Mrs.
"Wiokes' will was called, but has been,
postponed three times. It was an awful
thing to do and I think that undue influ
ence was brought to bear upon the poor
woman, who was bed-ridden the time she
made the will leaving her husband's
property to Dr. Shannon."
EVICT MOTHER AND CHILDREN
Turned Out of a Cheerless Home on
Tehama Street.
Secretary Wadham of the Eureka So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children investigated tne case of the
family of Joseph Murray, at 31 Tehama
street, yesterday afternoon. The husband
has long been neglecting his wife and
five children and spending his earnings
in drink. When Secretary 1 Wadham
reached the house he found that a Dep
uty Sheriff had moved all the furnituro
of the little home out on the sidewalk
upon a writ of ejectment issued by the
court in the name of Miss F. E. Madison
and sister and sued for by Madison &
Burke. It was learned that two months
will be due on January 5, so there is real
ly but one month owing now. The chil
dren are respectively 9, 8, 5 and 3 years,
and there is a little tot of 20 months who
is seriously ill with measles, but that
did not prevent the owner of the premises
from throwing them out on the street
for rton-payment of the small sum of $S.
Secretary Parnell learned that the hus
band was working at Broadway
wharf, and he immediately went down
there and placed him under arrest for
failure to provide. He will be summarily
dealt with. For months he has never
brought anything home to eat and hi 9
family has been living on the charity of
the neighbors. Mrs. Murray is a worthy
woman, who works when she can, but
hor five children require her constant
ci re, especially the little one who Is sick.
Some friends took the six unfortunate
ones to their home, -where they will be
taken care of temporarily. Secretary
Wadham will endeaver to have the young
ones placed in some public institution
and thinks the mother will be able to
take care of herself. As for the father a.
term in jail will probably bring him to a
realizing sense of his responsibilities.
