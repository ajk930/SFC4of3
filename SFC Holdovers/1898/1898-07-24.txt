SANTIAGO, July 22 (via
Kingston, Jamaica, July 2s).
General Shafter has sent the
following letter in reply to
the communication addressed
to him by General Garcia, in
which the Cuban leader com-
plained of the treatment ac
corded to the Cubans and
announced the withdrawal of
his troops from further co
operation with the American s:
I must say that I was very
much surprised at the re
ceipt of your fetter this
morning and regret exceed
ingly that you should regard
yourself in any way slighted
or aggrieved. You will re
member the fact that 1 in
vited you to accompany me
into the town of Santiago to
witness the surrender,
which you declined.
This war, as you know, is
between the United States
and Spain, and it is out of
the question for me to take
any action in regard to your
forces in connection with
the surrender, which was
made solely to the American
army. The policy of my
Government in continuing in
power temporarily persons
occupying offices is one
which 1 am, of course, una
ble to discuss. To show you
the views held by my Gov
ernment I inclose a copy of
instructions received by me
yesterday from the Presi
dent, which appear to cover
everything thatcan possibly
arise in the government of
this territory while it is heid
by the United States.
Full credit has been given
to you and your valiant men
in my report to my Govern
ment,and ! wish to acknowl
edge to you the great and
valuable assistance you
rendered during the cam
paign. 1 regret very much
to know of your determina
tion to withdraw yourself
from this vicinity. I remain,
yours very sincerely,
SHAFTER,
Major General.

PREFER ANNEXATION

Madrid Merchants and Others
Having* Interests on the Island
Favor Rule by Uncle Sam.
LONDON. July 24. â A special dispatch from Madrid says: Mer
chants and others having Cuban interests assert that their correspon
dents write that all seem to prefer annexation to the United States to
independence, fearing thÂ« vengeance of the Separatists if the Ameri
cans do not remain to protect life and property in the islands.
Senor Dupuy de Lome says the split between the Americans and
the insurgents offers the best opportunity for peace that has occurred
since the destruction of Admirpl Cervera's fleet.
The Madrid correspondent of the Observer says the condition of
the Government is now most critical, and that the authorities are de
voting all their attention to preventing a revolution and safeguarding
the dynasty. The -Government offers the 8000 officers of the army in
Cuba employment immediately upon their return to Spain, with the
object of removing their opposition to the establishment of peace.

WARSHIPS ON- THE
WAY TO PORTO RICO
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Qonlon Bennett.
CAPE HAYTIEN, Hayti, July 23.â |
Four large American warships wore
sighted off the harbor at 6 o'clock last i
evening. They were going in the direc
tion of Porto Rico. The German bark
Carl, Captain Vols, arrived here to
day. Her commander reports that he
saw eight American, warship? lasi
nitrht at 9 o'clock off the coast of j
Hayti. He had a flashlight on his ship, j
and tried to make out the names of the i
Americans, but they were too far away. !
NO REPORT ON THE
ALLEGED TREACHERY
WASHINGTON, July 23.â Doubt Is
cast upon reports of recent exciting
events among the Cubans at or near
Santiago, owing to the failure of Gen
eral Shafter to make any report upon
them, and inasmuch arÂ» he has made
less important subjects matter of dis
patches, it Is hard to understand why
he should fall to mention an event of
such importance as the reported attacK
by Garcia upon Spanish troops on t^eir
way to surrender to Shafter. T
was no health report received t. ">m
Shafter to-day; but, so far from being
discouraging, this is believed to indi
cate the continuance of the improved
condition reported yesterday and the
day before as to the health of the
camp.
The War Department Is now, while
keeping a close watch upon General
Miles' expedition, looking with interest
for detailed reports from Genera! Shaf
ter telling of the engagement preceding
the leading up to the surrender of San
tiago. It was reported io-.lay that Col
onel J. J. Astor of Shafter'H staff was
due in Washington, bringing with him
the full capitulations signed by the
commissioners, and It wan expected
that Shafter's preceding reports would
accompany them. However, up to the
close of official hours, which to-day, to
the relief of the hard-worked clerks,
was 3 o'clock, for the first time in many
months, the officer did not appear, and
the department does not know where
he Is.
It is stated positively at the War
Department that the letter which Gen
eral Garcia is represented to ha c ad
dressed to General Shafter, announcing
his withdrawal from further co-opera
tion with the American troops, has not
yet reached the War Department. The
officials are inclined to believe th.tt if
the letter really existsâ and of that
they have litUe doubtâ it will reach
Washington only throuph the mails
from Santiago.

ARTILLERY
TO PLAY A
BIG PART
Will Sot Slaughter
Men in Porto Rico
Campaign.
Gen. Miles Does Not Intend
to Use Infantry Until Forti
fications Are Reduced.
NEW YORK, July 23.â The
Washington correspondent of
the Herald telegraphs: The
quantity of artillery taken to
Porto Rico by General Miles and
the character of the materials
called for by him strongly sug
gest the kind of campaign that
will be carried on in Porto Rico.
It is to be an artillery fight,
and the plan was to-day outlined
to me by an official high in au
thority on this basis. That offi
cial, who stands near to the Sec
retary of War, pointed out on a
birdseye view map of San Juan
and vicinity, just prepared for
the use of the War Department,
that artillery would be put on the
many hills commanding the city,
fortifications and harbor. This
will be done at leisure, and effec
tively.
Meanwhile the fleet of Admiral
Sampson will take its position
off shore. The official added
that it would not be infantry
charging up the heights before
an entrenched city, but the shell
ing of a city that would be be
low e*very point occupied by our
troops. The city of San Juan is
situated on an island, and separ
ated from the mainland by a very
narrow arm of the sea, over
which there are three bridges, re
spectively for railroad trains,
trolley cars and wagons.
It is expected that the.se three
bridges will be destroyed by the
Spaniards. After the reduction
of the city, however, by the shore
batteries and fleet pile-drivers
and piles and mechanics will be
brought into use for replacing
the bridges, and for the first time
the infantry will then take part.
It is not thought the infantry will
have any heavy work to do, as
it will be comparatively an easy
task to march into the city, which
will probably have already sur
rendered, and occupy it.
It is probable that official cable
dispatches from General Miles
will be infrequent and much de
layed. Not only have the cables
touching at Porto Rico been cut,
but the St. Thomas cables, which
are nearest, are subsidized by
Spain and will not carry United
States Government messages.
The nearest points from which
cablegrams can be sent are Mar
tinique and Porto Plata, San Do
mingo.
LESS SERIOUS THAN
MIGHT BE EXPECTED
WASHINGTON, July 23.â The War
Department authorities say the yellow
fever situation among the troops, as
shown by to-night's dispatch, is less
serious than they had expected. With
27,000 men before Santiago the officials
say that with the conditions considered
the proportion of victims and of the
pick is less than might have been ex
pected. Adjutant General Corbln said
to-night that the men were largely af
fected by exhaustion and over-expos
ure.
"There is not," he said, "one regi
ment that is not infected, and for that
reason none of the men from the com
mand at Santiago will be taken on the
Porto Rlcan expedition."2
FAMILY DINNER THAT
COST FIVE MILLION.
NEW YORK, July 23.â A dispatch to the Herald from Pittsburg
says: Pittsburg has the distinction of having had the most expensive
dinner ever given in this country, perhaps in the world. In round fig
ures that feast cost its host $5,000,000. The home of Charles Lockhart
was the scene of this dinner. Mr. Lockhart is a Standard Oil magnate
and his wealth runs into more than .any five other millionaires in this
city. Mr. Lockhart has been slightly indisposed, and one evening
about a week ago he arranged for a little family reunion. Mr. Lock
hart has five children, two sons and three daughters. The five chil
dren and other members of the family were present at the dinner in
question, and when they lifted the plates set before them the two sons
and three daughters each discovered thereunder a certified check for
$1,000,000, and as there were five checks the total was $5,000,000.

Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS9S, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, July 23.â America's diffi
culties with the insurgents in Cuba
and the Philippines are causing some
amusement here. The Debats last
night and the Matin this morning had
articles on the situation. The Gaulois
also says that the Cubans and Ameri
cans are not far from being at logger
heads. The Debats says that in the
Philippines Admiral Dewey refrains
from bombarding Manila until the
American troops arrive so as not to
leave the place to the tender mercies
of the insurgents. As Aguinaldo re
plies to this by coquetting with the
Germans, Spain appreciates the situa
tion by authorizing Augusti to treat
with the rebels and "so bring the in
surrection as quickly as possible to an
end." In the meantime Aguinaldo tries
to form the semblance of a Govern
ment, and is certain that if the United
States do no satisfy the aspirations of
the Philippines they will have to fight
the insurgents just as the Spaniards
have to.
The Debats says it is in Cuba that
the deceptions have been the greatest,
and that it is there the awakening has
been most rude. Far from the Cubans
being a sort of colonists rebelling
against the oppression of the Spanish
'King Gf-nrge, " it is found they are
people who find rebellion easier than
working. The Matin finds that the
dissensions with the Cubans supplies a
comic quality lacking hitherto. The
Americans, it says, have discovered the
Cubans are not worth a drop of their
blood.
The extraordinary thing, it adds,
dryly, is that they make this dis
covery just at the moment when the
Cubans, having helped pull the chest
nuts out of ;he fire, are timidly urging
their right to eat some of them.
"Th^y are to be pitied," says the
Matin. "AmTicans thought they were
ting in a humanitarian cause, that
they v, â¢â !â¢â  avenging oppression and
were to give Cuba hf-r independence,
while in Bpite of themselves they find
they are pimple conquerors."
As to the Gaulois, it attributes the
nsion i" the Americans' dislike of
thÂ° people of the colonies, and con
clude? that Spain and the United States
will sign peace and will unite in dis
paraging Aguinaldo and the Tagals
and Maximo Oomoz and the Cubans.

Has Served to Obliterate Any-

WASHINGTON, July 23.â Prpsldent
MrKinl'-y has sent the following let
ter to General John B. Gordon, In re
sponse to the resolutions adopted by the
Confederate Veterans' Association, In ses
sion at Atlanta, Ga.:
Executive Mansion.
WASHINGTON, July 23. 1898.
Hon. John B. Gordon, Commander-in-Chlef
Vnlt-d Confederate Veterans, Atlanta, Ga.â
Dear General Gordon: Your recent telegram
In behalf of the United Confederate Veterans
was very welcome and I would have written
before in acknowledgement except for the un
usual demands upon my time. The war lias
certainly served one very useful purpose in
mpletely obliterating the f-ectional lines
drawn in the last . one. The response to the
nation's call to arms has been equally, spon
taneous and patriotic in all parts of the coun
try. Veterans of the pray as well as of the
blue are now fighting Fide by side, winning
equal honor and renown. Their brave deeds
and the unequaled triumphs of our army and
navy have received the gratitude of the people
of the United States. To have such a hearty
commendation from yourself and your col
leagues of the work of this administration in
the cpnduct of the war and the pledge of what
ever support may be needed to help in bring
in;r It to a successful completion Is indeed most
gratifying and I thank you especially for the
frank and cordial expression of the resolu
tions passed and forwarded to me. With very
kind regards, I am, sincerely yours,
WILLIAM McKINLEY.

KAYS CHOSEN
TO ARBITRATE
Named as Los Angeles'
Representative.
WATER FIGHT'S NEW PHASE
THREE MEN TO DECIDE THE
PURCHASE PRICE.
The Appointee an ex-Treasurer of
the City and a Man of Wealth
and Unquestioned
Integrity.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 23.â At last
after much juggling and a great deal
of useless and unnecessary by-play, the
city has named its arbitrator under the
water company's contract, who is to
act with the arbitrator of the corpora
tion to fix the value of the company's
improvements to the water distributing
plant which it leased from the city
thirty years ago yesterday.
The arbitrator named by the City
Council to-day is James C. Kays, ex
city treasurer, ex-sheriff of the county
and at present a member of the Board
of Trustees of Highlands Asylum, ap
pointed by Governor Budd. Kays is a
Democrat, and, in order to secure his
appointment, four Democratic members
of the council combined with one Re
publican and Kays got five of the nine
votes in the council. A strong endeavor
was made by a certain element in the
community to have J. S. Slauson, the
retired capitalist, named, but the
scheme failed because Councilman
Blanchard refused to stay with the Re
publican majority.
The appointment of Kays was a
great surprise, but he is a citizen of
unquestioned integrity and a man of
wealth.
When the Council met with the
water company's directors this morn
ing the city made a formal tender of
$1,000,000 for the water company's plant,
which was refused. The City Attorney
then presented an ordinance which pro
vided for arbitration. The ordinance
had been shown to a number of Coun
cilmen before it was presented. These
Councilmen claim that when they saw
the measure it provided that the Coun
cil at once proceed to the appointment
of an arbitrator, but when it was read
in the Council chamber it had been
changed so as to provide for the ap
pointment of an arbitrator on Mcmday.
Councilman E. L. Hutchinson ob
jected to this and claimed that an at
tempt was being made to work in a
job. The scheme was really put up by
friends of Slauson to gain time, so that
one more vote could be secured for
him, which was essential to obtain his
appointment. It was thought th;it
Councilman Blanchard could be won
over to Slauson by Monday, but by a
vote of 5 to 4 the ordinance was
changed to provide for the appointment
of an arbitrator at once, and by the
same vote Kays was elected. Compen
sation was fixed at $25 a day. The
Council also provided that the city pay
its half of all expenses of the arbitra
tion.
The clique that heretofore has bc^en
dictating a.ll moves made in the Council
in the direction of municipal ownership
is now in the minority. What the result
will be no one seems to know, but there
is a general feeling that whatever is
done cannot be worse than the inactiv
ity of the past five months.
NO ADVANCES YET
TOWARD PEACE
And Premier Sagasta Anxious to
Have It Understood He Has
Not Been Interviewed.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. ISOS, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, July 23.â T0-night a para
graph is published in all the papers
stating that Premier Sagasta his given
no interviews to any correspondents.
This is to deny any possible interview
which may have been manufactured
out of a few words the President of
the Council spoke with a representa
tive of American journalism, which he
fears may be construed into an inter
view which he has not given.
The Government understands the
country and has stemmed the tide of
Carlism by its active measures. There
are absolutely no advances toward
peace. French and English newspapers
are wildly at sea and shipwrecked ut
terly in their prognostications.
Spanish Sloop Captured.
KEY WEST, July 23.â The torpedo
boat Cushlng, which left here yester
day with dispatches for the blockading
squadron, returned this evening, bring
ing Lieutenant Colonel Rebalcava of
Brigadier General Roja's division of
the insurgent army, now operating in
Matanzas province. Colonel Rebalcava
left here about a week ago on the tug
Uncas with a small expedition carry
ing a quantity of rifles, food and cloth
ing. A landing was effected near Car
denas without difficulty. On Thursday
last the Mangrove captured the Span
ish sloop Alguldita, off Boca de Sagua,
fifteen miles from Cruz del Padro. The
sloop carried a crew of four men, who,
at sight of the approaching gunboat,
leaped overboard and swam to the
shore. The cargo consisted of dyewood,
a small lot of food supplies and $25 in
Spanish silver. She will be brought
here by the Uncas to-morrow.
Crushed by an Elevator.
SAN DIEGO, July 23.â George Foster,
a prominent business man, met sudden
death this afternoon. He was a mem
ber of the firm of Bradley & Foster,
proprietors of the Santa Fe House.
He went into the basement of the ele
vator shaft to draw some wine from a
cask. While there the elevator came
down and struck him on the head,
breaking his neck. The elevator boy
heard no sound and knew nothing of
the accident until Foster's body was
found a half-hour after the accident.

VICTIM'S BODY BLOWN TO

Series of Explosions Wrecks His
Cabin and Fire Completes

Destruction.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, July 23.â Crazed by
drink Charles Ityde-11, a rancher near
Mountain View, blew himself to pieces
with dynamite this morning. His sui
cidal act was one of the most horrible
recorded in this county.
Rydell had been drinking heavily for
several days. Between 7 and 8 o'clock
this morning neighbors were attracted
to his cabin by a heavy explosion.
When they drew near the cabin Rydell
stuck his head out of the door and told
them not to come near. He said:
"I am just touching off a few of these
things; I've got plenty of them. If you
don't keep away you'll get hurt."
The onlookers stepped back, and just
then there was a terrific explosion that
' shook the cabin from its foundations.
' A dozen or so more explosions fol
; lowed and the cabin caught fire. The
| neighbors were afraid to go near to
1 check the flames because of the explo
sions, and the structure and its con
t- ins were destroyed.
After the whole had been reduced to
' ashes the remains of Rydell were
; found. The arms and legs had been
! burned from the trunk. The head,
! which evidently had been blown to
I pieces by the dynamite, was nowhere
i to be found.
.It. is thought that Rydell placed a
; cap in a stick of dynamite and explod
ed it with a fuse. When he spoke to
j people who were attracted to the cabin
he had the appearance of a wild man.
Scattered about on the floor was $124
in stiver.
Rydell had resided near Mountain
View about two years. He owned six
acres and was engaged in clearing off
the land. He had dynamite in the
house for splitting wood, and it was
this he used in his own destruction.
He was a native of Sweden, unmarried
and about 60 years of age.

BOSTON, July 23.â Boston is horri
fied at the grew&orae discovery of
wholesale infanticide In the heart of
the city. The bodies, of isix infants
were discovered in a vicajax lot at the
corner of 11 >gers avenue and Leon
street, Roxbury, at 5 o'clock on Friday
morning, and another was found to
day. The bodies were lying in an open
field, without any protection from the
elements. The police have been unable
to ascertain when they ' v^re placed in
the field or by whom. A searching in
vestigation is being made.
The bodies were found by Mrs. Kin
nahan. She took some ashes to sift in
a vacant lot. On entering the field she
noticed a bundle wrapped in cotton
rloth. She investigated, and found the
bundle contained a dead child.
The police at once began to investi
gate, and the bodies of five more babies
were found in close proximity to the
first. All were wrapped up in the same
way, and apparently had come from
the same place. Medical Examiner
Draper was notified, and made an ex
amination. None appear to have been
dead a great while.
A thorough search of suspicious
houses in the neighborhood is being
made by the police. The details of the
awful discovery are sickening. A gag
was tied over the mouth of one of the
murdered infants, and the other's faces
were black from strangulation. There
were also evidences of poisoning, and
the corpses had been covered with
quicklime to hasten decomposition.
An officer found the body of another
infant, apparently only !â¢ few hours
old, on a sidewalk in Tront ct 381
Northampton street this morning. It
was wrapped in a piece of black cloth.
Would Annul the Contract.
NEW YORK, July 23.â George Os
good to-day brought suit in the
Supreme Court against the Compania
Trans-Atlantlca Espanola, J. M. Ca
ballos. agent, who, in behalf of the
Spanish line, made the bid for trans
porting 25,000 defeated Dons from San
tiago to Spain at $55 for officers and
$20 for enlisted men. The suit is to
annul the contract the quartermas
ter's department made with the en
emy's steamship, company. The
ground for the suit is that the contract
is against public policy and gives aid
and comfort to the enemy of the
United States. Technically, Mr. Lord
sues for $100,000 damages, but the real
object is to effect the annulment of the
contract.

mies not to come, but -regardless of the
warning they entered the town. .
They started to return to their country
home, but were warned by friends not
to go back by the county road but
to make a detour , through tne woods, as
danger was scented. ..They insisted that
they were able to protect themselves,- as
both were heavily armed, but they had
traveled less than a mile when they were
unhorsed by a volley of bullets, both be

THREE MEN KILLED
BY CAVING EARTH
PRESCOTT, Ariz., July 24.â A cave-In
occurred at the United Verde copper
mine this morning, causing the destruc
tion of the assay office and part of the
foundry on the surface. E. W. Johnson,
civil engineer, a nephew of W. A. Clark,
the owner of the mine; C. E. Beveredge,
the assayer, and a laborer named Larson
were killed. A mining expert from New
York whose name is not known, was
seriously, probably fatally, injured. Su
perintendent Giroux, whose office is in
the assay building, had just left when

ITS STEAM LAUNCH ACTS AS
PILOT-BOAT.
Lights at Point Loma and the En
trance to the Harbor in Use for
the First Time Since
War Began.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, July 23.â 8y order of
the Lighthouse Board, the lights at
Point Loma and Ballast Point, together
with the beacon lights marking the
channel into San Diego harbor, have
been lighted, and in future will be used
as heretofore until further orders, so
that vessels bound to this port may en
ter and depart during the night as well
as by day. The mines will, however,
remain down and the electric current
turned on after 8 p. m.
Due caution must be used by the
masters of vessels drawing over five
feet of water when approaching the
mine fields so as to pass between all
the mine buoys. During the day th#
buoys are easily distinguished, but ar
night they cannot be st-t-n, as they are
not supplied with lanterns. To over
come this difficulty, the steam patroling
launch of the auxiliary cruiser Corwin
will be sent to the mine fields as here
tofore promptly at 8 p. m., and will take
up a position in the channel in close
proximity to the sunken mines. A red
light, visible all amund the horizon,
will be displayed by her during the en
tire night, BO that friendly vessels en
tering or leaving the harbor may have
some indication of the position of the
dangerous ground.
Vessels upon arriving abreast of the
red light will be piloted through the
channel by the officer in charge, who
will point out the safe cou'-Sf. by going
ahead of the vessel until the water re
served for the enemy has been passed.
This plan has bo e :n adopted in order
that our own commerce as well as that
of neutrals may no longer be menaced
by these dnn serous obstructions.
On the niprht of the 15th inst., while
at anchor off Ballast Point, the United
States steamer Corwin captured the
junk Acme of San Diego for running
over the mine fields. She was heavily
laden with guano, and was drawing six
feet of water. Her master was taken
on board the Com in and the junk sent
to the city and tied up at the Custom
house dock. The work of the Corwin in
guarding the entrance to the harbor,
together with the mines planted by the
engineers of the army, is appreciated
by the people of San Diego, who are
in constant dread of the arrival of
some Spanish gunboat or privateer
which may be lurking in some South
American port. Already eleven vessels
have been seized and laid up for viola
tion of the harbor regulations.

NIPE HARBOR
TAKEN BY FOUR
AMERICAN SHIPS
Gain Possession of the Place After
a Prolonged, Furious
Bombardment.
The Topeka, Annapolis, Wasp and Leyden
Silence Forts, Sink a Gunboat and
Scatter Spaniards.
KEY WEST, July 23.â Acting under
orders from Rear Admiral Sampson,
four American warships on Tuesday af
ternoon last entered the harbor of Nipe,
on the northeast coast of the province
of Santiago de Cuba, and after a fu
rious bombardment took possession of
the harbor. The vessels engaged were
the Topeka, Annapolis, Wasp and Ley
den. In the course of an hour they
silenced the forts, sunk the Spanish
gunboat Jorge Juan and scattered the
Spanish riflemen who had taken part
in the engagement.
On Thursday the Annapolis, Wasp
and Leydon came from Santiago, and
Captain Hunker of the Annapolis, who
was ranking officer, was surprised to
learn that Nipe had not been taken.
Admiral Sampson had understood that
this had been done, and had orders for
the monitors detailed for the PortoÃican
campaign to rendezvous there. When
the sitaation had been cleared up, Cap
tain Hunker ordered the ships to go in.
The Wasp and Leyden, being the small
est of the quartet, led the way, followed
by the Annapolis, while the Topeka,
which carried a heavier battery,
brought up the rear.
The channel leading into the harbor
was very narrow, and on a bluff to the
right, called Galory Point, were a fort
and signal station. As the American
ships entered the Spaniards were sig
naling- in a lively fashion, apparently
notifying the ships in the harbor, which
were the Jorge Juan, two smaller gun
boats and an armored launch. As the
Wasp and Leyden rounded the point
the fort fired a dozen shots, none of
which, however, fell near them, and
the Topeka returned the fire with her
three-pounders.
Almost immediately the Spaniards
deserted the fort and retired, while the
Topeka continued to send shells into
them. A body of riflemen on the beach
returned the fire with a few wild shots,
but, they, too, were quickly dispersed
by the Topeka's smaller guns. The
Topeka also discharged several torpe
does. At the same time another small
fort to the left of the channel*fired on
the American ships, but it was silenced
as easily as the other.
In the meantime the Wasp and Ley
den had taken up a position in the
northwestern portion of the harbor and
opened fire across the water at the
Jorge Juan, which lay to the southeast,
in front of the town of Mavari. Her
position was about a mile and a quar
ter from the beach, and behind her a
third fort stood on an eminence. This
fort opened on the Wasp and Leyden,
and as the Annapolis and Topeka came
up the Spanish gunboat joined in the
fight and a general batt.e followed.
The Topeka anchored in the middle of
the harbor, about 4000 yards from the
Jorge Juan, and the other three Ameri
can boats drew up on either side and
formed a semi-circle. The Americans
then closed in on the Spanish ships.
The Topeka sent four-inch Bhella
crashing- into the Jorg* 1 Juan at such a
rate that she sank ' itl.in twenty min
utes.
When the firing became heavy the
officers and crew of the Spaniard put
off in a small boat, made for th â  B
under a heavy fire and escaped into the
woods.
Two shots from the Topeka's bow
gun. fired at an elevation of 4500 yards,
dropped square into Mavari fort, the
Spanish pennants disappeared and a
white flag was run up. This ended a
phui't, but one of the most vicious, bat
tles of the war.
All of the American ships sent small
boats over to the Spanish gunboat,
that of the Topeka being under com
mand of Lieutenant Niblack, the for
ADVERTISEMENTS.
The men who lay aside the comforts of home and the pleasures of home
life and answer the call to duty on the field of battle in a far-away land are
entitled to the best the market affords. We have no criticisms to make.
The Government has done wonders in equipping so large an army in so
short a time. Mistakes have been made, but they could not be helped. We
see men from the East shivering under one or two pairs of light-weight
blankets at the approach of our July zephyrs, for which the Government
doubtless paid $6, while we are offering and are glad to sell an all-wool
Marysville (Cal.) double blanket a.t $4: real good jjnes at less money. We
have 600 pairs too many for July trade. We have no canvassers or solicit-
ors, and take this plan to apprise the shrewd buyers of this coast that we
have in store everything that a soldier needs or appreciates, and at the right
price. Come and see.

mer naval attache at Berlin, Vienna
and Rome. They found that the Jorge
| Juan's forecastle had been entirely
nipped away by the Topeka's four-inch
shells, and that her fore and mizzen
masts and flagstaff were carried off.
It is thought the Spaniards scuttled her
before abandoning the vessel.
The harbor was found to be well
mined and two of the mines exploded,
one about 100 yards off the Topeka's
bow and the other 200 yards from her
port quarter. As the ships came out
they saw a contact mine floating on the
surface of the water.
The engagement was hardly over
when the torpedo boat Dupont
came along with dispatches from
| Rear Admiral Sampson for Com
mander Remey, and Â« the Topeka
was sent with them to Key West, ar
riving this morning. She had borne
the brunt of the fight and bore her
self nobly. Her captain is William S.
< lowlea, a brother-in-law of Colonel
i Theodore Roosevelt.
The Jorge Juan was a three-masted,
j one-funnel ship of 960 tons, and 1100
i horsepower. She was 320 feet long,
j thirty-five feet wide and twelve feet
draft. She carried a crew of 146 men
and had 130 tons of coal. Her battery
was heavier than the Topeka's, be.ing
the best of the four ships, consisting
of three 4.7 Honturias, two 1.8 Krupp
' guns and two machine guns.
Xipe harbor is twenty miles? long and
I ten miles wide. It is surrounded by
mountains and Is admirably suited as
a base of an army campaign.
CRIES OF "ROBBERY!"
FROM THE LOSERS
DETROTT, July 23.â Dissatisfaction over
the judge's decision giving the last heat
of the 2:22 class trotting toDLC marred
to-day's sport at Grosse Pointe track.
Much money had been placed on True
Chimes on the auctions for this race.
Both he and D L C got two heats. In
the final heat D L C was leading in the
stretch and Anita S came with a rush and
the crowd thought she nipped the bay
horse. The judges, however, thought dif
ferently and awarded the heat to D L C.
Then a cry tvent up from the specta
tors, who thought that if Anita S had
been given the heat Geers could have the
sixth heat from D L, C.
There were cries of "robbery," but the
judges were firm, saying that D L C had
a bead the best of it. In neither the
judges' nor the timers' stand was tnero
any other opinion, so it wouM seem D L
C won the heat all right. Trrie Chimes,
with two heats to his credit, broke badly
in the fojlowlng two and was out of it.
Geers had him on his feet better in the
fifth, and the bettors thought hp could
have captured the sixth had not the
judges made their decision against

HITT TALKS OF
HAWAII'S FUTURE
Anticipated Annexation Eighteen
Years Ago and Now Predicts
Great Benefits.
Declares the United States Should Not Fear the
Chinese and Leper Elements of the
Islands.
Copyright, IS9S, by George Grantham Bain.
NEW YORK, July 18.â I asked Rob
ert K. Hitt of Illinois, the chairman of
the House Committee on Foreign Af
fairs and a member ol th Hawaiian
Commission, w hat effect the annexa
tion of Hawaii in going to have in ex
â .g opportunities for investment
and enterprise for Americans. Mr. Hitt
has never been to Hawaii, but in his
long service in the State Department
and the diplomatic corps ami as chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Af
fairs, he has gained an intimate knowl
edge of the subject. He has a better
understanding of it, perhaps, than
some men who have I spicu
ously identified with the annex
movement, because Mr. Hitt has anti
cipated the annexati in of Hawaii for
more than eighteen years. He told me
that he had discussed it with James G.
Blame when he was first Secretary of
State, and that he had said at that
time to members of the House of Re
presentatives that they would better
be thinking of some form of govern
ment for the new territory, because it
was sure to be American some day.
Mr. Hitt told me that asidt from the
political and strategic value of the isl
ands on account of their position, he
thought a fuss entirely out of proi>< r
tion to their importance had been made
about them.
"Why, think," he said, "they are no
bigger than many a Congressional dis
trict and they do not contain a popula
tion much more than half that i
average congressional district. Of
course, th ."ity will increase as
soon as the American flag is ;
over them, giving absolute assurance
y. without possibility of any
attempt to restore the ridiculous, r
.. or of foreign occupa
tion. In that respect they are go!
a better opportunity for Invest
ment under stable certain government
and ' f the men who now
live there will increase in value.

there are many perilous places where we
need the help of a pilot who has a thorough
knowledge of the special difficulties and

In those delicate physical weaknesses and
diseases peculiar to women a general prac-

Only a specialist who has given a life of

competent to treat the diseases of woniar's

Any woman suffering from these delicate

to Dr. R. V Pierce, chief consulting physi-
cian of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical In-

years' at the head of his splendid staff of
specialists, he has successfully treated many
thousands of cases of obstinate feminine

His '" Favorite Prescription " was devised
for the sole purpose of curing the diseases

. ment In the islands. There was fear of i
the Japanese. Very recently business j
men there have been uneasy at the j
consequences of the aid which the re- i
public has given to us, or rather which j
we have taken from it during our war
with Spain. Since war began an Amer
ican cruiser has been lying in Hono
lulu harbor. Our ships went to the
capital of those islands on the way to
i Manila and coaled as thougl* they had
a right there. And you must remem
ber that the law which makes a nation
responsible for damage inflicted on
another nation through aid given to its
enemy is largely of our own making.
"When the treaty of 18*1 mi.i nego
tiated at Washington it was the United'
States which proposed that a nation
giving aid to one belligerent should be
i held responsible for any damage in
flicted on the property of the other
belligerent by that means, out of
that grew the Alabama claims, for
which we received $15,000,000. England
hesitated at this provision, but we in
sisted on it as international law, and
it was agreed to and we Invited other
nations to join us in it. All that ap
prehension by business men in Hawaii
disappears with annexation.
"James G. Blame gave notice to the
world that if Hawaii was threatened it
would be Americanized. But we have
nev< r undertaken, while it remained a
distinct sovereignty, to preserve it from
claims for damages arising from its
acts. By assuming the right to use, not
Pearl harborâ which was ceded to us
a long time agoâ but the harbor of
Honolulu, we placed Hawaii in a posi
tion to be the subject of a claim for
heavy damages at the hands of Spain
when this war should be. over.
"Why did we not use Pearl harbor?
Because the mouth of that harbor is
still e!<-sed by a reef. It is one of the
most remarkable harbors in the world,
a punch miles inland, like the harbor at
Santiago, of which everybody is talk
i ing now. The approach to it is through
; a narrow, irregular channel, witn eon
! verging acclivities on each side, the
i channel opening into a broad harbor
ior lagoon of ample depth. The hilly in
tervening country protects this harbor
' from the fire of an enemy's ships wlth
; out.
"The reef which lies across the mouth
! of this channel is a coral formation,
' but the borings made by Admiral
Walker show that part of it. a rift or
fissure 500 feet wide, is coral sand,
which could be drawn out with the use
of a suction dredge. It was estimated
â¢ that a small opening of 200 feet in this
reef could be made by an expenditure
of $85,000, and a channel of 260 feet ,
\\ kle for $105,000. I once trfpd to get ;
I Congress to make an appropriation for :
this purpose so as to make the harbor '
. available, and I had th> hope that then
we should build fortifications to pro
tect it and that the American flag |
should float over it. That undoubtedly j
will be done now."
I asked Mr. Hitt If the missionaries
and their descendants would not profit
largely by the increase in property
values through annexation.
"Possibly," he said. "But the white
man has made the land what It is. If
the Kanaka had remained in sole pos-
Bession of it what would it be worth to-
I day? I have little sympathy with the
; sentimentalism which some good peo
: pie waste on the Indian. The worth ol
â  land is what man makes of it. (.live tt
an Indian to-day four city squares on
F street in Washington, some of It
property worth $40 a square foot, but
i with the provision that none but an In
dian was to be permitted to set foot or
it, what would it be worth? Let the
Indian as an Indian occupy it and what
could he do and what did he do before
white men came but shoot squirrels or
it? The land which we took from the
Indian was worth very little so long as
;it remained Indian land. So the propo
j sitlon that we have robbed the ImMur
of this great precious roperty is ab
surd. In the same way the land of Ha
j waiS would have been worth little il
! the Kanaka alone had remained in po3
session of itâ it wpii'ci require a big lot
: of it now. as was once the actual case,
to be worth an old suit of clothes."
One of the difficult problems which
the Hawaiian Commissioners will have
to solve is the Chinese problem. It ha?
! been one of the bugaboos of the Ha
waiian question from the beginning. ]
a^k.-d Mr. Hitt if he beiieved it would
be a complicating problem.
"I trust not insoluble," he said. "My
understanding is that most of tlie
1 Chinamen and Japanese are there un
j der contract, and that they will sto:* Jily
tend to go back to their hon.es when
the contract expires. They CAUiot be
come citizens, of course, because of the
I laws. They have not the rit.ru to vote.
The annexation resolution lorblds fur
th'.r Chinese immigration. Ihe statis
tics for ten years past show the de
partures of returning Chinest and Jap
; ancsc is about half as large a.5 the ar
i rivals, and now the arrivals will cease.
"The Chinaman has a great oc-^ire to
get back to his home as soon as he can
accomplish his mission of making
money enough to keep him in affluence
! for the remainder of his oa>s, nnd it
; takes very little to do that in China.
i One of the reasons Is the matt ;r of his
bones, which, according to iris supersti
tions, must be buried In Chinese soil.
Another is the desire to be an afliuo.it
personage in his native village with a
fortune of $300.
"I think the Chinese labor question
! Is not giving the people of the United
j States as much concern as formtrly.
llt was once the favorite topic for
speeches in industrial cities, for news
paper edit rials and magazine articles
and we heard about the hordes and
myriads of Chinamen who wer-_- to
overrun this country. But the exclu
sion law is really very effective. A
Chinaman squeezes in here and th*ro.
but the number who are smuggled in is
inconsiderable.
"The Chinese question gave less con
cern to the Chinese Government at the
time we were first exercised about it
than most of us thought. At the clmc
the exclusion law was under consider'
ation the Chinese Minister was at my
house one afternoon and the subjeor
! came up. I had said on the floor of
the House that while I was opposed to
the competition of Chinese labor with
our own, I was equally opposed to the
violation by this nation of its treaty
with China, and we ought to make a
new treaty and not pass a law vio
; lfiting the one in force.
"The Chinese Minister said that the
matter of excluding Chinese labor from
this country was one which did not
' interest his government save as to the
question of its dignity involved in the
! treaty, and was one about which his
, government would rather not be
i troubled. All of the coolies came from
one province, a trivial leak from a cor
ner of their vast empire, and he likened

the condition to the trickling drops of
dirty water from a lean in the
corner of an immense vat. Of
course, if the rights of an in
dividual Chlnamai. were violated,
as in the case where some China
men were burned to death at Rock
Springs from sheer wantonness, his
government would step in to protect
them. The whole power of a govern
ment will be used to protect one sub
ject of that government in his rights
In a foreign land.
"The Chinese rulers are by no means
a stupid set," continued Mr. Hitt.
"Many years ago at Paris I talked one
day with the Chinese Minister about
railroads. It was just after his gov
ernment had torn up six miles of rail- i
road which had been constructed from
Shanghai. I asked him why this ob- i
Ject lesson in the usefulness of travel j
by steam had been removed from the j
sight of the people when it might have
done so much in educating them to a '
realization of the need of other and
longer roads. Our people were inter
ested at the time in seeing an opening
for American investment and Ameri
can labor in building roads in China.
"I said to him: 'You know the value j
of the steam railroads?' He answered |
that he knew it quite as well as I. 'But,' I
he said, 'we of the governing class have
a different task from that in America.
With you the effort is continually to do
something new, to excel. Your pc >ple
are always talking about doing ho much
more in this or that direction than waa
ever dene before. Our one purpose is
to keep the j people in order, coi-tentr-d
and quiet. 'We do not want another
Tae Ping rebellion. A rebellion in China
means the loss of many million lives â
much more than your civil war cost
you.
" 'When the six miles of railroad was
laid no regard was paid to the burial
places of the dead. In China ihe dend
are not all gathered in cemeteries, but
the tombs are scattered everywhere. It
is a part of the religious feeling of my
pople to believe that the dead can be
disturbed, and that their spirits then
disturb everybody else. It has been
said in the lower classes that the dead
were disturbed by this railroad, and
that they were bringing on calamity.
That impression had gone out quickly
through a district densely populated,
until it had penetrated thirtj or forty
miles in all directions, creating fear
and discontent, missing hardiy any one
in its progress.
"The ruling class, of course, has no
belief in such things, which powerfully
influence the lower classes, but it was
necessary to quiet them and appease
them. So the matter was gravely in
vestigated, and the SoU- High Priest of
'redâ that is, the Emperorâ having cast
his eye on the railroad, decreed that
it should be torn up and sent to the
other end of the earth. As a matter
of fact, it was sold, but not to China.
The iron was sent to New York.
"This. Chinese statesman said that
there was only one way in which the
railroad could be introduced in China.
The Chinese people resented the in
troduction of foreign labor, and es
pecially of a foreign contractor who
bribed the officials and became
wealthy. The Chinese railroads, he
Bald, would have to be built by Chi
nese, and they would have to b.? intro
duced at a time when it could be said
that they were being built not to
bring the enemy Into the country, as
the Chinese people thought they were
then, but to enable the Emperor to get
at the enemy.
"That was the way in which the tele
graph was introduced. It was said
that it was intended to bring the news
to thÂ»- Emperor. "When the people un
derstood that this was the purpose,
they raised no objection to it and now
China has many telegraph wires. In
the pamp way modern weapons were
Introduced, because It was said to the
people that the Emperor had seized the
enemy's weapon to use against him â
that gunpowder was originally a Chin
ese invention. The prediction which
this Chinese Minister made has been
verified and to-day Chinese labor is
building railroads through China."
I asked Mr. Hitt if the Hawaiian
people had acquired citizenship in the
United States by the act of passing the
resolutions of annexation and if we
were hereafter responsible for the acts
of the Hawaiian government. He said
hp did not understand this condition
would fully exist until we had taken
possession of the islands formally and
raised our flag over them. Ev^n after
that, it is expressly provided in the
annexation resolution that the laws of
the island should remain in force until
nÂ» W laws are ma/le by Congress. He
said It was a recognised principle
in all countries that existing laws
continued in force until actually
superseded by others. Merely be
cause v.c had voted to annex the Isl
ands they could not be without law
until Congress should make laws to
govern them.
I asked him if he believed that there
was any danger of the introduction of
leprosy into this country from Hawaii.
".Not at all," he said. "We have a
U-j.^r colony in I^ouisiana and there is
another in Canada. I never heard of
any one catching leprosy like smallpox
or yellow fever or measles by merely
being in the place where the lepers
were or coming Into passing contact
with them. I suppose if a man lived
and associated closely with lepers and
came in contact with them for a vr--.iv
he might get leprosy in his PVStem,
especially if predisposed by scrofulous
affections or uncleanly in habits. I
saw a colony of lepers in Jerusalem
years ago, and while there went many
times to the places where they were.
No one seemed to be afraid of the con
tagion of the disease. It is a dreadful
malady and generally deemed incur
able. But the leper is not so unhappy
as most people think. He has no pain
from it. When they were taken by
charitable German ladies to a hospital
just outside of Jerusalem they would
\>-;uch to escape and return to the
others."
Mr. Hltt probably does not welcome
his new duties and responsibilties very
warmly, since they come to him at the
end of a long and very trying session of
Congress. Speaking of the adjourn
ment, he said he was glad it had come.
He thought it was well that the House
did not leave the Military Committee of
the House to sit during the recess and
to potter about investigating the con
duct of the war.
"The proposition," he said, "recalled
to many the work of the committees
of Congress during the war of the re
bfllion. You remember the history of
the army of the Potomac and its many
defeats and hard fate for a long time?
Not satisfied with one Bull Run, ad
verse fate brought another. All this
time the armies elsewhere were push
ing steadily forward. Congress thought
to remedy the trouble in the an,
the Potomac by sending committees
With stenographers to take testimony
about all sorts of things and publish it
to the world, disheartening the country
and bringing on criticism of command
ers. The recent impatience of the press
brought back vividly the old cry, "On
to Richmond!" It was the most fate
ful phrase the war brought into being.
"When the war began the people of
the country were assured that it was
to be short and decisive. Mr. ,Seward,
always sanguine, with much expendi
ture of rhetoric, assured them it h-.tp
to be a ninety days' war. The people
could not understand why April went
by and then May and June and noth
ing seemed to be r^eomplished. They
could not patiently vait and take time
for preparation. They expected to go
right down South and crush the rebel
lion at once. They learned io b fc pa
tient and the cost of incoiwMi
haste, and at last bore the long v.ar
with steadfast fortitude and unqu>
able courage. That lesson should have
taught this generation to be patient
with the administration in the short de
lays of our war with Spain."

LITTLE DANGER
OF INTERFERENCE
Representative Dingley Says Euro
pean Powers Will net Meddle
in the War.
WASHINGTON, July 23.âRepresenta
tive Dingley of Maine, who has been In
the city as one of the members of the
Canadian-American Commission, when
asked to-day, "What do you think will bo
the solving of the Philippines problem?"
replied:
"No one can tell at this time. Events
adjust themselves, and sometimes in a
sudden and unexpected manner. I feel
sure, however, that thore is no founda
tion for the talk of alleged European in
terference In whatever programme this
Government may adopt for the Philip
pines. I believe the rumoreu protests of
the powers of Europe will be found to
be merely unauthorized reports and will
not materialize into anything definite.
The conduct of the Germans at Manila is
subject to criticism, but their action, I
believe, will not go beyond bounds.
"I do not pay any attention to the al
leged attitude of Europe protesting
against the sending of Commodore Wat
son's fleet to the coast of Spain. Such a
supposition would be untenable. This
(Jnvrrnment is at war with Spain, and wo
have a right to strike her where and
when we please. It remains for us alone
to say whether we will send a fleet to
Spain. Of course, if we contemplated
seizin? ia\d holding Spanish territory on
the continent of Eurooe it might cause
disquietude among the powers for fear
that the balance of power might be dls
turbeu. They would have no right, how
ever, to object to the harassing of the
coast and commerce by a fleet."

AGNEWS ASYLUM
INQUIRY TO BEGIN
NEXT TUESDAY
Governor Budd Fixes a Date at
the Request of the Hospital
Management.
There is to be an official investigation
of the Agnews scandals. Governor
Budd is indignant over the fact that
the concluding days of his administra
tion should be besmirched by the un
savory mess that has been uncovered
in that institution, and he has deter
mined that he will thoroughly fumigate
and purify its moral atmosphere.
There was a meeting of some of the
members of the State Lunacy Commis
sion yesterday in the office of the At
torney General, at which there were
present, beside the Governor, Secre
tary Carrere, Or. Matthews of the
Board of Health, Dr. Hatch (Superin
tendent of State Hospitals) and Isaac
Upham (trustee and manager of the
Agnews Asylum).
The meeting was not open to. the
public, but from the tones of the
speakers, as heard now and again, it
was not lacking in animation, es
pecially on the part of the Governor,
whose voice indicated that he was not
pleased. The gathering was brought
to an end by the action of Isaac Up
ham, who presented the following re
quest, which was granted by a unani
mous vote:
"Gentlemen: As a manager of the
Agnews State Hospital I hereby re
quest that the Commission of Lunacy
investigate at its earliest convenience
the general management and adminis
tration of said hospital."
The Governor set next Tuesday at 11
o'clock as the time for the investiga
tion to heein. The inquiry will be held
at the asylum at Agnews. The secre
tary was directed to inform Dr. Spon
ogle of the action of the commission
and to issue subpenas for witnesses.
ATTACHES COACHED
BY THE ASYLUM RING
SAN JOSE, July 23.â John F. Carrere,
secretary of the State Lunacy Commis
sion, made a flying trip to San Jose
this afternoon and served notice upon
Trustees Hale and Curnow and Dr.
Sponogle to- be present at the investi
gation to be held at Agnews Asylum
next Tuesday morning at 11 o'clock.
The notices served request the mem
bers to be present at an investigation
of the general management and admin
istration of the hospital and to have
such witnesses present as they may
desire to appear before the coramls
sic-ji.
Carrere was in San Jose just long
enougri to see Hale and Curnow and
then drove to Agnews to serve Spon
ogle, where he caught a train for San
Francisco.
Trustee Frank H. Gould arrived at
Agnews Asylum this evening. For the
past couple of days the employes at
the institution have been preparing f^-r
an investigation, and Gould's presence
was needed to give them the final pol
ishing oft: before the fateful day. Meet
ings have been held by the employes
and there has been an attempt to get
them solidly back of Sponogle and the
administration. Those who desired to
remain neutral were greatly excited tc-
day, for if they failed to come out
for those in charge they would
be regarded a.s enemies Ol viould. To
morrow ana the next day, it is said,
the asylum employes will be given a
private examination to lind just what
they know In regard to existing affairs.
The Investigation by the Lunacy
Commission promises to be i
searching than the public expects and
th< Bession will probably last the bal
ance of the week. Gould will be at
the asylum up to the time of the mv
v estimation.
To-morrow Trustees Hale, Curnow
and Gould and Dr. Sponogle will hold
an extended conference. They will
outline their plans for the investiga
tion. The leaders of the attendants
will be given their orders and when the
investigation opens everything will be
well greased and in working order.
Trustee <;"Uld refused to talk to
night on the forthcoming Investiga
tion. He said he had nothing to say
for The Call, and with an oath brought
the interview to a close.
Chairman Curnow of the Agnews
managers In speaking of the. investiga
tion to-r.ight said:
"I havt- been summoned to an invest
igation on Tuesday morning, and as far
as I am concerned I want the whole af
fair investigated. If there is anybody
there whose morals are not of the best
1 want him dismissed. I am inclined
to think the investigation should be by
the Agnews board of managers, but a
thorough investigation by either body
will be satisfactory. The investigation
should be strictly impartial and thor
ough. I have no pets there and do not
fear any truth that will be brought out.
As long as I have the honor of being a
manager I shall do my utmost to see
that affairs are faithfully and honestly
administered. I think the investigation
will cover the whole institution, as well
as the statements made against Dr.
Spono-gle, Mr. Tourtillott, Mrs. Madigan
and anybody else concerning whom
there is any suspicion of immoral char
acter and dereliction of duty."
Trustee Hale said he had discussed
the matter with Trustee Upham in San
Francisco last Tuesday and they de
cided to bring it before the State Lun
acy Commission. Moth agreed to join
in a letter asking for an investigation.
He had expected to sit as judge in the
case at first, but now he may be one of
the witnesses. Under ordinary circum
stances, he said, he would have liked to
try the case, but with White and Up
ham probably disqualified he was
pleased with the arrangement by which
the State Lunacy Commission would
hold the investigation. The charges
against Tourtillott and Mrs. Madigan
are the only formal ones before the
local board, but other matters may be
taken up.
As to Dr. Sponogle being illegally in
office, Mr. Hale said the doctor had
never laid claim to having had three
years" experience in asylums, as the
law required. Dr. Sponogle was ap
pointed first assistant under Dr. Hatch
and when the latter accepted a place on
tho State board Sponogle succeeded as
medical director. Mr. Hale said:
" I desire the fullest, freest and
frankest investigation of the affa*rs of
the institution of which I am a man
ager. I realize some statements have
been made detrimental to the general
welfare of the institution and I would
like very much to have such investiga
tion aa will prove the truth or falsity
of the charges. We enjoyed a reputa
tion some two years ago of having the
best-managed asylum in the State of
California and received this compli
ment from the Chief Executive of the
State. I believe a majority of the
managers are anxious to see the insti
tution restored to its former prestige.
This can be accomplished only by
weeding out all undesirable and In
efficient employes, ifithere are any
such whose names decorate the
asylum payroll. The selection of cap
able and efficient employes for the va
rious positions should be considered
paramount. It may be true some man
agers have been mistaken in the per
sons recommended. Such errors may
have resulted in bringing about exist
ing conditions at Agnews, and if such
there be they will be corrected in the
future."
WATSONYILLE, July 23.â Edward
White, one of the Agnews State Hospi
tal directors, stated that the action
which Mr. Upham has taken in regard
to the matter is entirely agreeable to
him. He thinks that the lunacy com
mission, being entirely disinterested,
is the proper tribunal to investigate
the affairs of the asylum.

Name and Makes
Friends.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., July 23.â Lewis
Warner, the absconding President of
the Northampton Savings Bank and
the Hampshire Savings Bank of North
ampton, Mass., was captured by the
Louisville police this afternoon. He has
confessed his guik and is willing to
return to Massachusetts without re
quisition papers. When captured he
had only $7 in his pocket. He has been
living? in Louisville for several months.
The telegraphic account sent out
from Northampton at the time of War
ner's expose placed his shortage to the
banks mentioned at $640,000.
Warner has been in Louisville for
three months, living at a beardlng
house under the name of Frank Wil
liams. He made many acquaintances
while here and became particularly
friendly with a number of newspaper
men. In fact, he became a familiar
figure about the newspaper offices here.
He was in the habit of calling daily at
the office of the Courier-Journal for a
copy of the Springfield, Mass., Repub
lican.
After his arrest Warner admitted
cvÂ« rything, stating that he had taken
from the Hampshire County National
Bank, of which he was president, about
(240,000, and from the Hampshire Sav
ings Bank, of which he was treasurer,
fully $400,00'). Tht money he lost in
various speculations and unsuccessful
business ventures.
When captured the defaulter's valu
ables consisted of $7 in silver and a gold
ring. The local police will receive a re
ward of $10001.
SAN QUENTIN'S RECORD
FOR A FISCAL YEAR
SAN QUENTIN, July 23.â At the
monthly session of the State Board of
Prison Directors to-day Warden Hale
submitted his annual report for the fis
cal year ending June 30, 189 S. It shows
the net cost per capita vi maintaining
the prisoners to have been $9 06, a
slight increase over the cost of last
year, owing to the advanced cost of
supplies. The prison physician reports
thirty-seven deaths during the year, of
which iive were executions and one a
suicide. The chaplain has issued an
average of 2778 volumes a month from
the library.
In his report the Warden commends
the religious ministrations of Rev.
Father Lagan of San Rafael, the Vol
unteers of America and the Salvation
Army.
Twenty-five prisoners have made ap
plication for parole and sixteen of the
applications have been granted. The
terms of fifteen paroled prisoners have
expired and one violated the conditions
of the parole law and was returned.
Four paroled prisoners failed to report
and it has been learned that three of
them have joined the United States
army and gone to Manila. The fourth
is yet unheard of. The reports of the
balance on parole show that they have
been working steadily and are doing
well.
T;ie output of the jute mills for the
past year has been between 14,000 and
15,000 bags a day. The product for the
month of June exceeded the output for
the same month for the last five years,
being 4233 cuts of grain bagging, mak
ing an average of 162. M cuts* for each
of the twenty-six working days. The
number of grainbags on hand is 2,532,
000. There have been sold since Janu
ary 1, 1898, 1.677.451 bags. There is
sufficient raw jute in the warehouse to
run the mill until May 5, 1599.
L. Wadham, the expert accountant
for the board, reports the total
amount of money bloncing to the pris
oners to be $3833 63. The cash on hand
belonging to the State is $26,574 25. The
aavilable funds at the openifig of the
fiftieth fiscal year are $104,044 75.

STOCKTON'S POOR SUPPLY
NOT ADEQUATE TO THE NEEDS
OF THE CITY.
Officials Pledged to Municipal Own
ership Have Made No Move
to Carry Out Their
Promises.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, July 23.â The time when
the long suffering city of Stockton will
awn its own waterworks is drawing
near. Public sentiment is ripe for a
Jecislve move in that direction, and all
that impedes the carrying out of the
ivishes of the public is a vacillating City
Council. So strong are the people's de
mands, that it is hard to see how the
Council can longer delay granting re
ief. It may be said without exaggera
tion that there is no open champion
ship of the Stockton Water Company.
The only influence at work to coun
teract the wave of public sentiment is
that which is created by the few pe
:uliarly interested in seeing the present
company continue its grip on the con
sumers.
An actual necessity exists for the city
taking charge of its water supply. This
irises from two causes, the most press
ing of which is the inability and in
lispositlon of the company to supply
:he city with even a reasonably limited
quantity of water. The second is that
10 matter what kind of a schedule of
,vater rates is fixed by the Council, the
:ompany always manipulates it so as
o charge an exorbitant rate for a mis
jrable service.
For weeks the pressure has been so
sveak on the pipes that water could
lot be drawn from a faucet in a
second story. Worse than this, there
ire hours at a time when it seems like
in effort for a faucet on a ground
lour to give a bucket of water. For
some time the public was misled by
statements from the company to the
iffect that repairs were being made,
>ut now the time has long since passed
ivhen the company promised better
:hings.
The source of supply is artesian wells
it the east of the city, and the quality
seems to be as woefully lacking as the
juantity. The water is simply beeom
ng undrinkable. As the company )
las made no effort to increase j
he supply by sinking addi
lonal wells, it is hardly thought |
t would endanger its large dividends j
>y establishing a new plant with a view
)f improving the quality of the water.
Assessor Ortman has found it very i
lifflcult to get any facts concerning the !
irofits of the company, but enough is !
Known to show that the dividends must '
be enormous. It is conservatively es- i
tlmated that the entire plant could be
3upiicated for $175,000. But the credit;
for investing this much does not be- i
long to the company, as a few years ]
igo it obtained possession for less than
nominal consideration of a fairly good
plant belonging to the city. This, of
::ourse. has become a part of the gen
sral system. No plant can ever be op
grated on a cheaper basis than is this
one by the owners. Practically all of
the cost is in maintaining a small
pumping plant and a local office.
The managers of the company, on
their part, claim to be paying interest
on bunds which by their own state
ments equal the estimate given of the
amount invested. By their way of com
puting values these bonds should be
added to the value of the plant and
on the result the council should fix the
lawful rate to be charged. P.ut when
it comes to making assessment the
bonds Bhould lie deducted from the
value, which leaves n very insignifi
cant amount for the Tax Collector to
handle. A very just estimate of what
consumers are paying may be arrived
at by a comparison of the local sche
dule nnd that of Oakland. It will show
that for this miserably inadequate ser
vice the people of Stockton are paying
on an average 75 per cent more than
the Oaklnnders. The people down
there came near hanging their Council
men for perpetrating on them a sche
dule 75 per cent lower than that in
Stockton. Be it remembered also that
this city pays for every drop of water
used in sprinkling its streets.
Consumers were led to believe that
rates would be lower after July 1. But
where the company has lost on one
item an effort is being made to more
than make it up on others. No item
where a raise is possible has escaped
the keen manager of the company, lie
found numerous openings on restau
rants, hotels and rooming - houses.
When the keeper of a small restaurant
laid his customary $2 on the counter
the other day he was informed that his
bill hereafter would be $4 50. It w-.is
explained to him that the raise wus
lawful. Several others in the same
blr-ek have had Hlmilar experiences
The action of the company in the mat
ter of rates and the aggravations oc
c-isio-iied through the unreliability ol
the supply has given a boom to the well
borers. These firms are daily refusing
new contracts, as they have forty wells
to sink within thirty days. It would
thus neem that, the company's action
is calculated to lose it many patrons
- 1 hile the question of municipal owner
ship hnngs fire. The question has vir
tually resolved itself into one of self
preservation to the people of this city.
They must have healthful water for
necessary uses, and they must have
reasonable rates. It seems that the
company is not inclined to grant either.
The municipal platform of the Re
publicans, upon which they elected
William Inglis Mayor and a portion of
the Council, pledged the party to
municipal ownership. The city has the
option of taking charge of its own
mains and compensating the company
for such as it has put in. The present
city government has been in power a
year and no move has been made. The
local press is without exception favor
able to giving the people charge of this
most necessary service. The actual
growth and prosperity of the city de
pends on early and favorable action on
Hie people's demands. The City Coun
cil hotels the key. The voters have an
eye on their servants and very soon
each will be put on record.
SEVEN BIG MORTGAGES.
CHICAGO, July 23.â Seven mort
gages, aggregating $2,000,000 were filed
for record to-day by Levi Z. Leiter.
They run to the Northwestern Mutual
Life Insurance Company for ten years
with 4 per cent irrtÂ«rest. Th 3 proper
ties mortgaged are in the heart of the
down-town district, among them the
Grand Pacific Hotel. Revenue stamps
to the amount of $996 were on the pa
pers. This is to secure the heavy loan
just consummated by Mr. Leiter "in or
der to carry his son, Joseph <Leiter,
through his disastrous wheat specula
tions.
MEN OF DAWSON
LEAVE SHIP WITH
SACKS OF GOLD
The Garonne Arrives From the
North With Klondikers and
Their Wealth.
SEATTLE, July 23.â arrival from
Victoria this afternoon of the City of
Kingston, which connected with the
steamer Garonne from St. Michael,
caused considerable gold dust . to pour
into the assay office. One hundred and
fourteen passengers from the Yukon
.country had treasure, either in gold or
drafts, that at the lowest estimate is
placed at $300,000, while many believe
the amount to be $500,000.
The larger portion of the treasure was
held by a few old-time Yukoners. The
majority of the passengers had scarce
ly more than $1000 each. Among the
rich men were the following:
E. Alyward, Puget Sound. $40,000
Jack Brothers, Ottawa â¢ 35,000
N. Adams. Portland 30,000
G. H. Church, Juneau.. 30.000
H. N. Jacobson, Sacramento 20,000
R. B. Taylor, Yvheaton, 111 15.000
C. B. Elliott, Chicago 10,000

P. H. Young. Winnipeg â¢â¢â¢â¢ 8,000
Lewis Hfnger, Whatcom B.'iOO
A. B. McDonald. x<.ochester 5,000
The Garonne left St. Michael on July
12, just previous to the arrival of the
Seattle No. 1 from Dawson. She had
160 passengers with $500,000 in gold and
drafts. The steamer Leelanaw had ar
rived with two barges and two river
steamers. tt&Â£
3 The Alliance was expected *to leave
St. Michael for Seattle on July IS with
two-thirds of the river passengers
brought down on the Seattle No. 1.
The Yukon was still getting lower, and
many believed the low water record
would be broken this year.
The river steamers John C. Barr and
Rock Island No. 1 left for Dawson on
the r.th and 11th, respectively, laden
with passengers. It was thought that
the Reck Island drew too much water
to. get over the bar. She had the pas
sengers of the Garonne.
It is reported that the â¦ steamer
Charles Nelson had trouble with her
passengers. Some of them had been
landed and were living in boats on the
beach. Others refused to leave the
ship, as the company's river steamers
had not arrived. The Nelson was oth
erwise leady to sail south with a iot of
passengers. â,ââ
Two of the arrivals to-dayâ illiam
Buckingham and C. B. Elliott of Chi

LOST THEIR ALL IN THE
COPPER RIVER DISTRICT
TACOMA. July 23.â G. A. Kinsley
and W. L. McDonald of Stockton, Cal.,
Etre two miners just returned from Cop
per River. Their little pile has melted
away until they have barely enough to
reach home.
â  We left San Francisco last Novem
ber in a party of seven," said G. A.
Kinsley to-day. "A company was
formed, and each of us took stock.
When we left we were asured byaman
who said he had been in that country
that he would put us on good paying
ground. We landed at Orca on Decem
ber 11. From then on until we left
we had not been anywhere near paying
ground, and there is not the slightest
probability of any one ever getting on
ground in the Copper River country
that pays, or even ground that gives
color. Provisions are cheaper at Valdes
than here. Many times during the last
two months Hour has beer sola for 65
cents a sack. For over forty miles the
alleged trail is lined wit'i provisions,
left there by disappointed miners who
will never go back. If the mass of
people in there do not get out soon the
steamer lines or the Government will
have to bring them out.
"There has not been enough gold
taken out of that infernal country to
fill a small cavity in a tooth. We have
spent many years in mines in Colorado
and know what we are talking about
when we say that the Copper River
district is not a mining country. We
traveled around and prospected wher
ever there was the slightest probability
of success, but always with the same
resultâ no color. Six more disap
pointed men here from Copper River
were members of the Worcester
(.Mass.) party of forty-three that
started north three months ago with
big outfits and flattering prospects.
Several of the party are "strapped,"
and must go to work to get funds to
carry them home.
E. A. Pope of Illinois, now at Juneau,
probably had the most thrilling ex
perience of anybody who has ever ven
tured into the Copper River country.
Last April he lost a big outfit in Taza
line River while making his way from
Valdes to Copper River. He then
joined five members of a Government
expedition In an attempt to locate a
summer route to Copper River, along
an alleged Russian trail across the
Alaskan Range. Crossing the divide to
Tasmonia River, they veerel eastward
to the head waters of Low River, which
they followed down to Great Box Can
yon, through which the waters of a
large basin are drained into Prince
William Sound. This canyon is six
miles long with crooked turns and
granite walls 900 to 1500 .feet high.
The Government party built a raft
and started through the canyon on
May 22. Near its certer they suddenly
turned a bend and dashed over a 16
foot waterfall. The raft slruck a rock
below and broke into pieces. Pope
struggled to the right bank, where, wet
to the skin, he spent four cold rainy
days, without food, gazing up at the
perpendicular cliffs and hoping that his
companions, if saved, would come back
and let ropes down to rescue him.
Finally, in sheer desperation, he
made a ladder by tying alder bushes
together with strips of his clothing. By
fastening this to snags and rocks he
climbed upward 1500 feet, knowing that
a single misstep would dash him to
death. The day after reaching the
top he wandered into Valdes nearly
dead. His companions, who were ca.r
ried downstream on a piece of the raft,
believed he had been drowned.
KILLS THE MAN WHO
WRECKED HIS HOME
Pomona Bancher Slays His Cousin
and a Coroner's Jury Justi
fies the Act.
POMONA, July 23.â The culmination
of the suspicions that James Martinez,
a well-known ranchman in Pomona
Valley, has had regarding his young
and handsome wife's behavior, came at
2 o'clock this morning when he shot his
cousin, Jose Martirez to death at the
family homestead near Spadra.
James Martinez is a descendant of
the proud old Martinez family that
once owned land grants in Contra
Costa County. He is 38 years of age
and was married in 1891. His wife is 24
and is generally esteemed the hand
somest Spanish woman in Pomona Val
ley. She was formerly a belle in Span
ish society in Bakersfleld.
For a long time James Martinez de
clined to believe the reports of his
friends concerning his wife's relations
with his attractive cousin, Jose Mar
tinez, who lived with his parents and
sisters on a neighboring' ranch. A
month- ago, however, he caught Jose
in his house late one night, whereupon
Jose confessed having wronged him.
James Martinez magnanimously for
gave Jose when the latter vowed he
would immediately go to Fresno and
live there, and to have no further com
munication with the wife.
Last Tuesday James was Informed
that Jose was secretly hiding In Po
mona Valley, and that he and Mrs.
Martinez communicated with each
other. James armed himself and gave
no indication of his suspicions. He
told his wife last evening that he had
business in Pomona and would be
away from home all night. He came
to Pomona, remained about a billiard
hall all the evening, and then started
home. He reached there at midnight
Secretly approaching the house, he en
tered and went to bed.
At 2 o'clock he was roused by some
one stealing into the kitchen through
an open window. He called out and
got out of bed at once. He saw in the
moonlight Jose Martinez crossing the
floor in his stocking feet. At that mo
ment Jose started back and then he
fired twice at James. The bullets
went into the casing of the door an
inch from James. The latter snatched
up a revolver, and, running into the
dining-room, flred deliberately at Jose
The cousin groaned and fell back upon
the floor. James says he walked closer
and fired twice at the prostrate body.
Then he lighted a lamp, and, leaving
everything at home untouched, he
drove to Pomona, hunted a policeman
and gave himself up.
The Coroner's jury rendered a verdict
that Jose Martinez came to his death
by justifiable Bhooting at the hands of
James Martinez, who is now free.

he suffered. Some years ago an Italian
died and left his cane to Castro, say
ing in the cane Castro would find the
key to his wealth. Castro tried every
way to find the "key," but to no avail,
and, finally, becoming disgusted, he
sold the cane to Thomas Oliver. Oliver,
thinking to play a joke on the old man,

IN THE HOUSE
OF COMMONS
An Interesting Review
by Clancy.
STRUGGLE FOR LOWER TAXES
AN UNJUST DISCRIMINATION
AMOUNTING TO ROBBERY.
When Ireland Docs to England What
the United States Has Done to
Spain Her Rights May
Be Recognized.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
LONDON. Ju'y After an interval
devoted to English and Scottish af
fairsâduring which the most con
spicuous incident has been the blos-
Boming out of Sir William Harcourt,
the Liberal leader, into a full-blown
"2io Popery" crusader â the House of
Commons has returned to the subject
of Ireland. We have just passed
through another "Irish week" in that
assembly, and it certainly has not been
the least interesting since the session
began.
The week commenced with a discussion
of the financial grievance of Ireland, a
ord or two about which may be useful
efore I deal with the debate. When the
union of ISOO between Great Britain and
Ireland was accomplished by the act of
union of that year, it was provided, in
consequence of the great disproportion
between the debts of the two countries,
that Ireland should never be taxed on the
high British level till tv. contingencies
occurred, namely, tii! the debts of the two
countries came to bear to each other a
certain specified proportion, and till the
circumstances of the two countries be
came similar. By tixing the contribution
of Ireland to the Imperial expenditure at
an extremely high ligure the first event
was brought about in 1816, the Irish debt
having been aised in the Interval from
about twenty millions sterling to one
hundred and twelve millions. Thereupon,
without waiting for the occurrence of the
second event, the exchequers of the two
countries were amalgamated and Ireland
was declared to be sub.iect to the same
taxation as Great Britain. The act of
Parliament, however, by which this vlo
lation of the act of the union was effect
ed contained provisions for giving to Ere
land Certain "exemptions and abate
ments and down to 1553 certain articles
of consumption were actually taxed less
in Ireland than in Great Britain, while
up to that time the Income tax had never
been extended to Ireland.
But in that year Mr. Gladstone, about
whom so many Irishmen have gone into
raptures of late, commenced the process
which he himself completed in 18C3 of
making imperial taxation uniform in all
respects through Great Britain and ire
land. The results have been very strik
ing. In the ten years between 1553 and
1563 the taxation of Ireland rose 52 per
cent, while that of Great Britain rose
only IS per cent; and if the present state
of things be impared with that wntcn
prevailed Jn ISOO we find that whereas the
taxation of Great Britain per head of the
population has largely decreased while
the population has trebled, the taxation
per head In Ireland has doubled while the
population is b^low that of ISOO and Is less
than half whai it was tifty years ago.
A continual protest Llnst this system
of robbery by taxation has. of course,
been kept up by Ireland, but without ef
fect, though the late Sir Stafford North
coto C afterward Lord Iddesleigh) for
many years leader of the English Tory
party, "signed in 1864 a report of a com
mittee ot inquiry in which it was de
clared that "Ireland was one of the
heaviest and â  gland one of the lightest
taxed countries in the world." The sec
ond home rule bill of Mr. Gladstone was
Indirectly the means of fanning into a
flame the Irish agitation on this subject.
The discussion of Its financial provisions
resulted in the appointment of a royal
commission to inquire into the subject,
and that body, composed of ex-officials
of the British Treasury Itself and other
exports and representing all political par
ties, all but unanimously reported that
Ireland, taking into account its relative
taxable capacity, was over-taxed to the
extent of nearly Â£3.000,000 a year. This
report waked ip all Ireland with the ex
ceptlon of Belfast, and for the last two
years all political parties in Ireland out
side that town and all classes also have
united in an agitation for the relief of the
grievance. It is hi response to this agi
tation that the matter has been brought
up In the House of Commons, and there
I? no doubt that the last will not be heard
of it for many a day in that assembly.
Mainly through the efforts of Mr. John
Redmond, the leader of the Independent
party, the Irish members of all sections
(with five Orangi exceptions from
ITlpter) have been Induced to act together
Jn this matter in the House of Commons,
Rnd It was at the request of the united
body that Mr. Redmond became its
spokesman on Monday by opening the de
bate. The selection of Mr. Redmond was,
of course, an excellent one. No man in
Parliament can speak with greater clear
ness and directness, and on this occasion
his ha'racteristlc qualities as an orator
were admirably manifested. Among the
other speak, rs on the Irish sl<V > were Mr.
L,ecky. the distinguished historian, who
sits for the University of Dublin. Mr.
Lecky speaks like his books and with the
most extraordinary fluency, but he does
po in such a Bingsong, monotonous style
thai what he. says usually loses half Its
efrect. He, however, is listened to and
â p.-ith resnpct. and seldom fails to infl'i
ence. The leader of the Irish Unionist
party al?o, Colonel Saunderson, lent th^
aid of his rousrh-and-ready eloquence to
the cause for which Mr. Redmond plea l
ed, and he was followed on the same side
Jn the discussion which ensued by Mr.
Edward Blnke, the Canadian Irishman,
who Is not quite a success in the British
iment; Sir Edward Clarke, the
famous English lawyer, who is one the
few English advocates of Ireland in this
matter and who 1 s one of the most ef
fective pncaWTS In the HouhÂ» of Com
mons: Mr. T. M Healy. whose char
acteristics as parliamentarian T need
hardly cl^pcribp. and who on this occa
sion poured out 5 ctream of bitlncr invec
tive and sarcasm on the British op
ponents of the [rish cause, and others,
Ercrllsh nd Irish, of leaser note.
The answer was the old one. The Ch.an
cpilor of the Exchequer. iMisvmpathetic,
dull and dry as dust, denied th<> existence
of .th â  grlf>vn?iop imolalned of altogeth
er. His point was bat every - man was
taxed t/'e same In every part of the
throe kingdomsâ the very thing with
vhlch Irishmen find fault, contending
that under the. act of union they are
entitled to br. taxed at a lower rate than
either Knpliphmen or tchmen; he
would not consent as a Unionist tO treat
Ireland us a sonarnte geographical en
tity; and.' finally, h<- found n setoff for
any overtaxation which might exist in
the extravagant â  ndlture In Ireland
â setoff. I v the way, which does hot
e*lst and vhlch con only t,,. represented
as existing by counting as Irish expendi
ture enormous sums which are act
ually Bpeni i n Ireland for imperial pur
pr.pra and by counting as Imperial expen
diture other enormous sums which are
ppent in England for strictly English pur
poses. ThiÂ« lino of argument was adopt
ed also by Mr. Ralfour at the close of the
debate, and there was scarcely more com
fort to be derived by rrishmen from the
deliverance of Sir William Hnrcourt who.
speaking In behalf of the Liberals at
one and the same time Indorsed the mnin
finding in the rrnort of the. Royal Com
mission nnd denied tl at any man in Ire
innd ought to be taxed less than any
man in corresponding circumstances In
England. Yl'Y 1 '' 111 1 the pffect of thls answer
will be in Ireland I do not like to pre
dict. In other days not long gone by
name) y. when Parnell was at the head
of the Irish popular movementâlndigna
tion would soon. find vent In action. At
present Trish politics are in such a state
of eonfunlon and paralysis that even a
non-political movement embracing all
! parties is not very likely to be po con- j
ducted ob to bring trouble and Inconven- j
ience to the Government. Yet, as 1 said
myself in the debate- -with which I have
been dealing, trouble and inconvenience
are the only arguments which England
will expect when she is asked to stop
fobbing Irish money.
After I had heard the speeches of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and Sir
Wll'inm Harcourt 1 stated that if the
Irish were in a position to send an Ad
i miral Dewey or an Admiral Sampson to
d<> for London and some other British
ports what those officers had done at Ma
nila and Santiago the exact meaning of
el of union of 1800 would become
plain to the meanest British Intelligence,
but not otherwise; and l added that, if
the Irish organization tn charge of the
financial relations movement, instead of
Issuing pamphlets and leaflets, convert
ed Itself Into a committee to discover
means fur cheating the revenue, benefi
cial practical results might be attained
before long, but not otherwise. Of Course.
this expression of opinion has awakened
Indignation, but al! the same I be
lieve that I spoke only the naked truth.
As soon as the debate on tne Irish finan
cial Krlevance was over the House of
Commons entered on a consideration of
the provisions of the local government
mil, as amended in committee. In par
liamentary language this is known as the
report state, and will probably last till
the closÂ£ of next week. The matters BO
far discussed are not of much importance,
and, indeed, the same remark applies to
what remains to be discussed. One of the
new subjects brought up was in a new
clause proposed by myself, and will, per
haps, be of moment to persons Interested
In theaters and tne drama. Up to 1786
there prevailed in Ireland, contrary to the
custom in Ene-land. absolute free trade in
theaters. Any one could set up a theater
anywhere in Ireland and play anything
he liked in it. In the year referred to,
however, some insult was offered in a
Dublin theater to the Lord Lieutenant of
tne day, and in consequence an act was
passed for Dublin city and county by the
Irish Parliament prohibiting the per
formance of any stage plays except in
places licensed by patents from the
crown. Since then that law has remained
unaltered, and under it there nave always
existed In Dublin two or three theaters,
but none hi the surrounding townships,
and it is Illegal for persons to perform a
play of any kind, even for the p â ;:
of helping a Ci.arity. except in the thea
ters to which I have referred. I sought
to confer on the Dublin corporation and
the new Dublin County Council (which is
to be) merely the power to give occa
sional licenser, for the Derformani f
plays which has been possessed In
England by the local authorities for over
half a century. The Government compro
mised the matter by consenting to confer
that power on the Lord Lieutenant, and
this arrangement will, of course, effect
the purpose I had m view, which was to
enable dramatic performances to be given
in town halls and such places by ama
teurs for purposes of charity or amuse
ment. The ludicrous results of the pres
ent law may be illustrated by a slnglÂ»
c a few years ago one James
McNallv, who organized a pantomime in
the Dublin Mechanics' Institute and had
it played for about a month, was acfu
nllv sued by the Government for tb>- full
penalty he had incurred und< r the old
act of 17SR, namely, 300 pounds Bterling for
each performance, or over Â£10.000 in all!

HELD ON TO THE LOG
And Told an Impertinent Spanish
Officer That He Was Not En
titled to Consideration.

GUANTANAMO PAY. July 11.â
Admiral Cervera and the other
officers of the fleet of Spain were about
to sail on the Pt. I,ouis a.s prisoners of
war It was discovered by Flag Lieu
tenant James H. Sears that the officers
of th*- Cristobal Colon had their log
books with them. He reported the fact
to Commodore Schley, who at once or
dered them seized.
The second in command, Adolphus
Contreros, captain of the frigate, cams
aboard the Brooklyn and asked that
they be returned, as they were the
only records saved. Commodore Schley
said: "I will turn them over to my
Government for information."
Contreros stormed and pleaded, and
finally Commodore Schley lost his
temper, as much as he ever doesâ and
that is little â and said:
"I do not see that you are entitled to
ciny consideration at all. You sunk
your ships after you had surrendered.
; You ruined your guns and di I every
thing that a dishonorable enemy could
think of. I shall hold your log."
The story told by the log book is an
Interesting one. The minute details, as
translated by Lieutenant Benjamin
Wells Jr., from the daily record, con-
Ftitute a complete story of the move
ments of Admiral Cervera's fleet from
the time they left Spain to the memor
able day of destruction.

POLITICAL SUGGESTIONS.
< HE Democratic committee of one hundred,
having formally indorsed Judge Maguire for the
gubernatorial nomination, it would seem to be in
order for the party to entirely dispense with a State
convention, at least so far as the head of the ticket
is concerned. Economy is not only one of nature's
first laws, it is an immutable law of "reform politics."
If, as the committee of one hundred claims, it has
been created for the purpose of purifying the Demo
cratic atmosphere in this city, one of its chief duties
is to enforce economy in party management. How
can this be done more effectually than by dispensing
with a State convention?
Every person familiar with practical politics knows
that State conventions are expensive. Not only do
they cost a great deal for clerks' hire, stationery and
hall rent, but they entail traveling expenses upon dele-
The money spent by the delegates, indeed,
goes to enrich the railroads â a fact which ordinarily
a "reform" Democrat from center to circum
ference. All the trouble, expense and annoyance of
a convention may, as we have already said, be avoided
by the simple expedient of dispensing with that
method of nominating candidates.
According to all accounts Judge Maguire will have
no opposition. The appointed committee of one
hundred has declared for him, and is going to appoint
a delegation to the State nominating body in his in
terest. This delegation will cast at least one-third of
the vote of the convention, and even if the Judge were
opposed by a strong interior candidate lie would, with
the support of this delegation, be sure of nomination.
Why, then we ask, should the Democrats be put to
the expense of holding a State convention? Maguire
is a foregone conclusion, and as little or no interest
is being taken in the remainder of the ticket â it hav
ing already been cut and dried by the fusion confer
ence â its selection might as well 'be turned over to
the Democratic and Populist State Committees.
In fact, to make a long story short, what the Dem
ocrats sh'<r,i<! do in this campaign is to follow to a
logical conclusion the plan of operations they have
already adopted. Primaries of all kinds should be
abolished, conventions everywhere dispensed with.
and nominees by the "leaders." In this
way only can reform be enforced and the government
purified. The people are evidently unfit to rule, and
therefore pure Democrats should be put on
guard. Finally, it would be a good idea for the
committee of one hundred to i^sue a ukase forbidding
all persons to vote lor any gubernatorial candidate
except Maguire. This would at once settle the
whole business and bring "reform" in with a bound.
In order to accomplish this, it might not be a bad
idea U> order a sp<-ch! Ma^uirc election. The little
"giant" could then be chosen by acclamation,
We do not offer these suggestions in a spirit of
â what Artetnns Ward called "sarkastn," but as practi
cal hints for promoting Democratic reform. We
trust "Whispering" Gavin McNab and Iris fellow re
formers, Gotild and Alford, will receive them in the
right spirit and profit by them.
THE SPANISH LOG BOOKS.
REPORTS concerning the refusal of Commo
dore Schley to turn over to the Spaniards the
log-books of the Cristobal Colon show that,
despite the uniform courtesy of our officers to the
Spanish prisoners, they do not by any means hold
their captured foes in such high esteem as might
be supposed from their general conduct. The Span
iards did not act fully up to the standard of honor re
quired by civilized war, and, while our officers have
not taunted them with the shortcoming, they have re
membered it and on occasions make use of it.
Thus we are told that when the Spanish officer,
after persisting in his request for the captured books,
despite the courteously expressed refusal of Schley,
began to storm and rage, the commodore said:
"I do not sec that you are entitled to any considera
tion at all. You sunk your ships after you had sur
rendered. You ruined your guns and did everything
that a dishonorable enemy could think of. I shall
hold your log."
As a matter of established rule amounting to law
in naval warfare, the act of the Spanish in sinking
their ships after surrender was no better than piracy.
The moment the white &ag was raised in token of
surrender the ships were virtually ours, and the Span
iards had no further right to sink them or to injure
their guns. The snips should have been turned over
to us in the exact condition they were when the sur
render was ii\ide and our guns ceased firing.
We were extremely lenient with the Spaniards in
passing over their treachery in this respect. We might
justly have held them responsible for all the damage
they did to ships or arms after surrender. Instead of
that stern retribution, however, we treated them with
great consjderation. It is therefore surprising they
should have ventured to ask back their log-books
with a persistence that aroused Commodore Schley
to tell them the real opinion American officers have
of them.
WhjEREIN WELLS-FARGO ERRED.
IN response to inquiry, Collector Lynch has re
ceived from Washington the following definite in
formation :
The carrier company or Its agent must stamp
bills of lading.
N. B. SCOTT, Commissioner.
Good-by to the contention of the Wells-Fargo Ex
press Company that it is exempt from any war tax
and that its patrons must pay for it the tax the Gov
ernment intended the corporation to pay. The posi
tion never appeared to have standing in law or
equity, and the assurance of the president of Wells- 5
Fargo in assuming an attitude so palpably unjust was
a great surprise to the public. This particular cor
poration had been regarded as fair and liberal, and j
occupied in popular esteem a place which it delib
erately forsook when it attempted evasion, imposi
tion and unpatriotic quibbling. A sensible course
now would be for the company to yield, make an
apology and accept its share of the common burden
instead of foisting it upon those who have burdens
of their own.
President Valentine's letter to the Merchants' As
sociation puts his concern in a bad light. It asks for
delay until a decision shall be reached in a test case
at the F.ast. It discreetly avoids mention of the fact
that the big express companies have entered into an
illegal combination to defeat the purpose of Congress.
This combination is directly contrary to the statutes.
Every- individual connected with it is liable to indict
ment. The corporate influence which has been
brought to bear upon the office of the United States
District Attorney should be spurned as an affront,
and an evidence of corruption.
Of all the express companies only one, so far as
known, has consented to obey the law, and the others
have instituted against it a boycott, in itself an in
iquitous thing, and in this instance a double wrong
in that it is a punishment for having been honest and
fair. The honorable company is the Denver and Rio
Grande, with headquarters at Denver. The offend
ing companies are Adams. American. Wells-Fargo
and United States. They are trying to cheat the Gov
ernment or their patrons, and to take business away
from the only company which refuses to offend.
If Wells-Fargo people persist in the short-sighted
policy which has lost them friends there will be also
a material loss. It may be remembered that the Leg
islature has authority to exact a license, but has re
frained from exercising it. Such consideration will
be apt to be withdrawn if so wholly unappreciated.
The wisdom of casting pearls before swine has never
been demonstrated.
Meanwhile we hope District Attorney Foote will
press the matter, there being grounds for cases with
out number here, and no excuse for waiting for a
test to be made elsewhere. Every day is an ad
ditional unlawful gain to Wells-Fargo. It would be
well if the merchants were to send to the office of the
express company men to watch, to take the name and
editress of every person forced to pay for a stamp
which Congress says, and which the Commissioner
declares, must be paid for by the company itself. The
evidence would thus easily be procured. There is a
$50 fine for each offense such as Wells-Fargo per
petrates many times daily, and a rigid collection of the
same might open Mr. Valentine's eyes.
OPEN PRIMARIES VS. BOSS RULE.
ACTION taken by the Republican State Central
Committee yesterday, when contrasted with
the course pursued by the Democratic com
mittee, affords the people a striking object lesson,
showing the wide divergence between the methods
of the two organizations. The Democrats appointed
a committee of one hundred to usurp in San Fran
cisco the rights of the rank and file of the party in
the choice of delegates to represent them in the State
convention for the nomination of candidates. The
Republicans, on the other hand, have provided for
open primaries at which every Republican will have
a full and equal opportunity for the expression of his
choice.
This difference between the actions of the two State
committees will be observed throughout the whole
work done by the rival organizations in preparing for
the campaign. In the Republican camp there will be
the free play of popular opinion. In the Democratic
camp there will be boss rule. Among Republicans
all loyal members will have the privilege of voting at
primaries and determining the selection of the men for
whom they will be called upon to vote at the coming
election in sustaining their party and its principles.
Among Democrats there will be a cut and dried pro
gramme by which the favorite of the bosses and the
corporations will be nominated and the rank and file
of the party wiil have no voice whatever in any of the
proceedings from first to last.
The tone and temper of the Republican committee
was shown first by the cheering which greeted the
declaration of the chairman that the party shall be
free from the control of "bosses, corporations or cor
ruption," and second by the adoption of the rule call
ing for open primaries in all counties having more
than three Assembly Districts. There was some oppo
sition to the requirement for primaries, but it was
weak and came from a suspicious source. It is grati
fying to note that this opposition was just strong
enough to give occasion for showing the virtual
unanimity of the committee on the subject, and to
make it clear that the rule was not adopted without
due consideration.
Men who have guarded their independence in poli
tics will not fail to perceive the full significance of the
action taken by the Republican committee. It means
the elimination from the party erf all trace of boss or
corporation rule, and the exercise of the power in
the party of the people at large. No set of bosses will
assume to dictate to the Republicans of San Francisco
or of the State what men shall be nominated for
office. The appeal will be taken directly to the rank
and file of the party. The delegates to the State
convention will represent the true Republicanism of
the State, and not merely the mechanism managed
by wire-pullers.
It is not difficult to foretell the results that will fol
low the different tactics pursued by the Republican
party and the Democracy. Republicanism will pre
sent to the people this fall a ticket nominated by open
and honest means, which will stand for popular gov
ernment free from boss domination, corruption and
the degrading influences' of scheming corporations!.
Democracy, after ignoring the right of its members
to hold primaries, will present a fusion candidate
nominated by bosses to c.rry out a bargain with
Populism in the interest of office-seekers and of such
corporations as have need of pliant tools and unscru
pulous demagogues.
The outcome on election day cannot be in the least
doubtful. The action of the State Central Commit
tee has virtually assured victory for the v party ?.nd
merits the commendation of all loyal Republicans
throughout the State.
Augusti would be foolish to surrender to the in
surgents if he desires to retain his head in the place
where it has the honor to be growing at present.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 24, 1898.
McKINLEY'S CUBON POLICY.
WHEN President McKinlcy met and success
fully combatted the scheme of the Cuban sym
pathizers in Congress to accompany the declar
ation of war with Spain by a formal recognition of
the independence of the Cuban Republic, his course
was vehemently denounced not only in the House and
the Senate, but by the yellow press throughout the
country.
M;my we!! meaning citizens, moreover, who desired
to see the Cubans establish a free government of their
own, were misled by these denunciations, joined as
they were to a thousand misrepresentations and lies,
and to some extent united with the Morgans, Baileys
and their yellow kid supporters in condemning the
President. It will be remembered that the fight to
overcome the scheme of the advocates of the repub
lic was a hard one. It required an unwavering firm
ness and unwearying tact on the part of the President
to accomplish it. Fortunately for the country, how
ever, the President was equal to every demand made
upon him, and we are now reaping the benefits of
his wise foresight and statesmanlike sagacity.
At the present time hardly any man in the United
States except those who hold Cuban Donds hesitates
to approve the course taken by the President. Mr.
Bryan, who on his visit to Washington was so vo
ciferous in demanding that McKinley be forced to
acknowledge the government set up by the insur
gents, has relapsed into a silent and rapt admiration
of his red sash. Morgan talks of nothing but Hawaii,
and Bailey is dumb. Only the yellow press remains
to uphold the Junta, and there is evidence before the
public that such upholding as it gives is due mainly
to a desire to boom Cuban bonds.
This change in public sentiment has been due to
the discovery that the insurgent Cubans are not only
incapable of establishing a government of their own,
but are unfit to have one given to them at our hands.
The so-called patriots who have followed Garcia in
Santiago have performed no service to 'aid our troops
in overcoming the Spaniards. They would neither
fight nor build roads. On the other hand, they were
detected after the sea fight that destroyed Cervera's
fleet shooting from ambuscades at Spanish seamen
seeking refuge on shore from the sinking battle-ships.
The shirking of military discipline and labor, the
avoidance of battle, the waylaying of stragglers and
the killing of prisoners or disarmed foes, seem to con
stitute the tactics of the so-called CuWan army.
Doubtless some of the insurgents are brave, generous
and patriotic. It is inevitable that it must be so, for
the cause of national independence always appeals to
the better instincts of a people. In Cuba, however,
the patriotic movement has been swamped by the
mass of reckless, lazy mongrels, the spawn of the
tropics, who have joined it more for plunder and
booty than anything else. The patriots have been un
able to control this class of their followers, and, as
a result, we have had the disgraceful scenes enacted
around Santiago â scenes which effectually show the
unfitness of the Cubans to be treated as allies of our
armies.
Had we recognized Cuba, as the Democratic lead
ers and the yellow organs demanded, General Shafttr
would have had to place the Cuban insurgents, in con
trol of Santiago. He would have been compelled to
arrange his policy to conform to their programme, or
else he would have had to violate the alliance and put
Garcia down by the strong hand. It is almost im
possible, in fact, to overestimate the difficulties and
complications that would have surrounded us in deal
ing with the war in Cuba if the independence of the
island had been recognized. The people of all par
ties are now clearly convinced that the President was
right in his course. We have thus, another proof of
the statesmanship of the man whom the people elected
in 1806 as contrasted with the wild folly of the dem
agogue agitator whom they defeated.
OUR TREATIES AND ANNEXATION.
TREATIES must be kept or abrogated. As
pointed out by the Supreme Court in the queue
case, the beginning of restriction ot Chinese im
mingration had to be in the amendment of the Bur
lingame treaty, which was the supreme law of the
land.
China assented to its amendment, and thereupon is
based our right to exclude the Chinese by the several
acts of Congress, which have followed. The Chinese
now under our flag, with rights under the amended
treaty, are thereby guaranteed all privileges accorded
to citizens or subjects of the most favored nations.
It is under this favored nation clause that the
Chinese Minister at Washington has the right to in
quire into discriminations iti the employment of
tailors on contract work for the Government. The
situation illuminates the position of Chinese in
Hawaii. If annexation extends the shelter of the
constitution to those islands, the laws and treaties go
with it as the supreme law of the land. If so, our
amended treaty with China, favored nation clause and
all, goes with the flag. If so, there is no power in this
Government to prevent the Hawaiian Chinese be
coming free commoners in all parts of the United
States. '
It is apparent now, as it has been from the begin
ning, that when we annexed Hawaii we added about
30,000 to our Chinese population.
The anncxationists must answer for this. If
Hawaii is to be held under extra-constitutional gov
ernment, all our treaties witli other Governments
must fall along with that made with China, but they
will all have to be substituted by other treaties cov
ering the islands, since all nations must know their
rights in the seaports and on the soil of any nation.
If this horn of the dilemma be accepted, we will
be free to do as we please with the Chinese in Hawaii,
and the annexationists who are to make laws for the
islands must deport them, or answer to the American
people.
The whole issue turns upon whether we have raised
the flag over a land from which the constitution is ex
cluded. This is a major issue. The Supreme Court
may not review an act of the political branch of the
Government in acquiring territory, but that bench
will determine the constitutional status of such ter
ritory.
When the Examiner declares the President is dis
pleased at the brusque action of Shatter the declara
tioo may be taken "cum sali>." which, being
interpreted, means "Tell it to the marines." It is the
Examiner which does Shafter the honor to be dis
pleased. And perhaps the kicking out of a lot of
mischief-making correspondents could almost be de
fined as brusque.
If the report from Washington concerning States
which had not furnished their quotas of troop was no
nearer correct as to other parts of the country than
it was in reference to California it must be regarded
not as official, but merely a new style of fake war
bulletin.
If the Kaiser will curb his impatience he will know
all about the disposition to be made of the Philippines
in time, but there is no reason for letting him on the
ground floor.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
It seems to me the "local lyre" man
of the Visalia Delta deserves to be
more than local. He should be inter
national, universal. To all I can do
to promote this end I contribute cheer
ful effort, conscious that the laurel
wreath comes from unworthy hands.
I can do nothing better than quote
only from a recent number of tho
Delta, for one of my unhappinesses is
that I do not see the paper regularly.
In this number appeared four verses.
I cannot forbear quoting them all. The
reader can select from among them the
gem which may impress as the
brightest:
JULY IX VISALIA.
At this warm season of the year
No cooling spot Is found
Save where- the noble oak doth cast
Its shadow on the ground.
As a .matter of fact, there are other
cooling spots, but shall the poetic fancy
ibe hampered by facts? Not if I can
help it. The shade that any old tree
doth cast is just as good as oak shade.
A cellar is cooling. The bottom of a
well is actually chilling. No matter.
The poet must be unfettered.
VISALIA'S PLEASURE SEEKERS.
They're resting now amidst the shades
Of yonder mountain peaks.
And will not venture home again
For six or seven weeks.
The nicety of poetic calculation is not
to be marred by mathematical preci
sion. If he had said: "For five or
eight weeks" the effect would have
been utterly spoiled. He knows hi?,
business. I hope that when they shall
at last venture to come they will have
gained the strength to enable them to
.sit where the local lyre twangs, and
Appreciate what they are getting.
A WOMAN'S WHIM.
Why is it that a woman likes
Oftirru-s to wear a i'kirt
So long that when Hhe strolls about
It draggles in the dirt?
I have wondered at the same thing
myself, but never had the gumption to
ask in a way certain to bring an ans
wer. It is but pimple justice to the
bard that the lady explain, or else roll
up her skirts.
THERE'S NO ESCAPE.
As wo go through the world it does
Scorn very, very hard
To think that one day we must sleep
Alone in some graveyard.
The fourth may well be regarded as
the dazzling paralyzer of the collec
tion. Yet there is comfort. At least
when we are asleep in some graveyard,
with the accent on the wrong syllable,
we shall neither know about it nor
miss the strain of the "lyre.'!. There
Ms nothing earthly like this strain, but
I we have faith that the music of heaven
â  beats it. Â«
It is easy to imagine the Lord of the
local Hearstlings looking at the picture
of Shafter above the door leading to
the lair of boodle and musing: "First
he said we were liars, and then he
bounced us from Cuba. What, ho!
minion, anothr spray of laurol for the
general. He deserves something for
having sized us up."
To come into contact with such a
publication as The Pulpit and Social
Problems is a refreshing experience.
The only fault I would find with the
little magazine is that the title is too
cumbersome, and perhaps misleading.
Its treatment of all matters upon
which it touches is direct and sincere
as well as thoughtful and instructive.
I cannot agree with all its conclusions
concerning ethical points, but would
not presume to characterize the con
clusions as wrong, being open to con
viction, and receiving with the utmost
respect the opinions of *such men as
compose the editorial and contributing
force. The Pulpit and Social Prob
lems is devoid of any trace of_ sec
tarian narrowness ,or bias. It is fur
this reason especially I object to the
unwieldly title. It is a fact, regretta
ble perhaps, but not to be denied, that
pulpit discussion, as I have had the
privilege of following it, has been
marke.il by zeal rather than by broad
and lucid reasoning. Therefore the
title page is enough to create a preju
dice which might prevent a careless
observer from looking further, a course
which would be to his loss, and to the
restriction of the work the magazine
seems destined to accomplish.
To discuss any question with a man
of the caliber of the Rev. Owen Jones
would be impossible. I wonder that
his fellow ministers regard his weak
and silly mouthing as worth serious
consideration. When he charges that
the wickedness of California is due to
disregard of the Sabbath, and this dis
regard due to the preachers, he insults
tint common intelligence in which na
ture has seemed to deny him partici
pation.
In the North American Review for
February of last year there appeared
an article of much interest. It , still
possesses the element of interest, ac
centuated by recent events. It shows
that the business of prophecy'is some
times engaged in by amateurs. The
author of the article was announced as
a foreign naval official, and I assume
him to have been the navigator of the
bowl in which three wise men once
went to son. "Can the United States
afford to fight Spain?" was the ques
tion he asked, proceeding then to ans
wer in the negative. With a sweep
of his auguring eye he saw Spain clear
ing the oceans of our ships. He de
monstrated so plainly that as a na
tion warring on the seas Spain was su
perior that the observing patriot
shuddered and hoped our fleets would
stay where the Castilian bogie could
not catch them. He set forth that
this country had available for Atlantic
waters only twenty-nine ships, poorly
officered and manned, against which
the haughty don could turn loose
forty-fivfi wherewith to harass our
coasts, chase our commerce, and yet
hjive enough left for the protection of
Cuba and Porto Rico. In leading up
to this array of facts he had stated
with beautiful confidence that in the
end Spain would remain the owner of
Cuba. His faith in the torpedo-boat
led him to conclude that battle-ships
visiting Havana with hostile intent
would be sunk there. In his vision, he
discerned the American fleet divided
for assaults on two points in the West
Indies, and each section of it met and
overcome by the Spanish. I am in
clined to think that he erred. Far
be it from me to monkey with the lu
cid conclusions of a seer, but I will go
so far as to say that as to some de
tails he failed to attain that accuracy
By HENRY JAMES.
without which a prophecy sinks to the
level of a weather bureau guess.
When I first made reply to Publicola
it was not with the thought that from
the circumstance was to grow a long
discussion. Indeed, the space given
me must prevent an answer of the im
posing verbal dimensions of that by
which Publicola makes rejoinder. I
am bound to say that his second paper
evidences scholarly research, that its
arguments are. at casual reading,
plausible; its phraseology dignified and
even beautiful. But I cannot agree
with its conclusions. They impress as
being of the heart rather than of the
understanding. They are developed
arbitrarily instead of crystallizing from
fact, reason and elucidation. A pa
triot thinks certain things desirable for
the land of his birth and his affection;
he thinks certain lines will lead to
these things. Such a patriot is Pub
licola. It seems to me that while he
wants the country to grow great, all
the methods he prescribes are restric
tive. He would put it in a bottle, bid
it expand, but by no means expel the
cork.
I do not wish any reader to regard
me as posing as a constitutional law
yer. lam able to swear to not being
a lawyer of any sort, and as to famil
iarity with the constitution can claim
only such as any intelligent citizen
should possess. I hope I respect the
constitution as deeply as does Publi
cola, but I am not prepared to believe
that the intelligences conceiving and
promulgating it could by less than mi
raculous power have framed an instru
ment fitted without modification, for
all time, and applicable to conditions
of which they had never dreamed. I
do not think the world of to-day should
be governed by hands long ago turned
to dust, nor that In sudden emergen
cies we can be guided by precedent,
when the whole scope of history af
fords no precedent. Publicola says
the boast "I am a Roman" was once
as proud as that "I am an American."
True. Yet equip the American with
the knowledge he has by training and
as a birthright, the tastes he has cul
tivated, and set him down among the
glories of old Rome. He would view
the barbaric magnificence, the narrow
mental horizon, the crude mechanical
devices, the uncouth populace, with the
utmost contempt. Let us concede that
we have advanced, that Rome is not a
precedent.
Publicola asks a number of ques
tions, first: "Is It not true that the
American Government, cemented by
the Civil War, rests upon the consti
tution ?" The American Government
rests upon the constitution. It . rests
none the less securely because there
have been amendments made to the
constitution. The- question implies
more than can be sustained. That war
left cruel rifts between^seetions. It
is the war with Spain which has com
pletely restored unity, swept aside the
lingering hate - tinged prejudice,
brought us all with equal devotion, un
der a common flag.
Next, "Is it not true that the consti
tution is the supreme law of the lanr!?*'
It is, and should be. As the concrete
expression of the will of the people its
sway is only to be questioned by the
people themselves. But if the will of
people dead remain afterward to clash
with the will of the living shall the liv
ing have no voice? Publicola wants
to know where authority is found to
annex, conquer, hold or govern terri
tory which cannot be converted into
States. In section 8 of the constitu
tion, donning the powers of Congress,
there is the authority for the declar
ing of war and for making rules con
corning "captures on land and water."
The term used, as the lay mind appre
hends it. is a general one. The tak
ing of Santiago was a capture. The
taking of Manila will be a capture.
This strikes me as being authority
enough, and susceptible of exercise
without the rending of the constitution,
or the twisting awry of its intent.
Publicola admits the right to demand
indemnity and to exact temporary se
curity. At what stage shall this right
disappear? If Spain never pay would
not the right be permanent? Then
the dreaded thingâ territorial expan
sionâwould have taken place without
a jar.
The attempt of Publicola to draw a
parallel between the acts of King:
George, just before the revolution, and
those of the United States now, was
unhappy, how very unhappy I can
not take the trouble to demonstrate in
detail. We are not oppressing any
one. On the contrary, we are offering
to alien races better government than
they ever knew. Nor do I see why
Publicola should have abolished the
limitattons of treason and so broad
ened the crime as to make It embrace
all who do not think the constitution
forbids change, or who, putting such
construction upon it, are even ready to
have the constitution changed. Ac
cording to .his idea, although he does
not definitely so state, McKinley must
be rated as a traitor. In a word, my
opponent would have the Government
supported just as it is made under his
construction of the constitution, no
abuse eradicated, no wrong redressed,
no advancement possible save that
tending to promote congestion at home.
He says, "we must lift humanity up to
our ideals." How? By declining to
come In contact with humanity. By
leaving down-trodden peoples to writhe
under oppression. If we stand on a
foundation so frail that we cannot
reach beyond the shore line without
toppling into the sea, there is in us no
element of permanency. We might as
well perish in trying to broaden civil
ization as in curbing its tendency to
spread its reign afar and make the
dark places radiant. We cannot
still. If we attempt it, other nations,
refusing, will overshadow and :>t last
overwhelm us*by the weight and |
sure of their material Increase. "The
false sun of military glory" doea not
dazzle. It is a transient ill that force
must be employed it forward pur]

tion of familiarity which puts famous
men on the staff of a paper with which
they have no more to do than with
any other crime. Since the Examiner
published its fool Hobson letter, where
in the hero of the Merrimac was made
to stamp himself as various sorts of
an ass, it had in a measure refrained
from this style of indecency until the
arrival of its "special commissioner" at
Manila, when it broke out again. The
letter it presented as coming from
.- was a gross affront to a sol
dier and a gentleman. The idea of
dmiral having written to the yel
lOW thing about his "own laurels!"
who were conscious of experl
.r a shock at seeing the bogus
tent found speedy comfort in re
alizing that they were merely up
against another fake, characteristically
stupid, and formulated on the assump
tion that the circulation of the sheet
is divided between the crematory and
for the feeble minded.
* * â¢
For a time there seemed doubt as to
ther the Government intended
sending more troops to Manila, and
then the Rev. Sam Small spoke and
! the matter. He said no more
tnx r-s were to go, and straightway the
ng world knew that more were
going. By taking the allegations of
the Rev. Sam backward there is a rea
sonable chance of arriving at the truth.

BATHINGâ S.. City. A douche bath or
any form of a shower bath should not be
used when a person is tired or exhausted
from any cause, as tue reaction on, which
â¢ ads for its fal re
sults does not follow effectually when the
system is tired. The result of a shower
bath in such a case is apt to be internal
lii hi. which may be disastrous. It
does not follow, however, that a perspir
ing person should not bathe until cooled
off. As a matter of fact, if a person is
not exhausted, the fact that the pores
are opened is rather advantageous than
otherwise, as the reaction is enhanced,
and will probably follow more energetic
ally. A bath should never be taken with
in two hours after a hearty meal. The
first effect of immersion in warm, or in
cold water, is to seriously derange the
digestive process if that is going on at
the time, and by a physiological effect
that naturally follows to unbalance or
derange the whole nervous system. ThQ
result of this is extremely dangerous to
the bather.

between the United States and Ger

United States Embassador, In an inter

Mr. White, "there has been no question
at any time between this embassy and
the German Foreign Office relative to
the German desire for a coaling sta
tion In the Philippines, nor for posses
sion of any of the islands there; neither
has there been any discussion of Ger

From another source the correspond

obtain an official confirmation of this
at the German Foreign Office.
Emperor William is kept continually

There exists a marked contrast between this "SIMON-PURE" SACRIFICE SALE OF
FINE AND MOST FASHIONABLE GOODS and the Fake Sales of Chinese-Made Shoddy
Junk now running riot in ourimmediate neighborhood. This intelligent community is
getting tired of THEIR FLIMSY BAITS, thrown out in the way of odds and ends to
hoodwink the inexperienced buyer into their shop to receive a coating of fleece,
a fact made plainly visible by the crowds which flock to our store in quest
of the GREATEST CLOTHING VALUES EVER TURNED LOOSE IN THIS STATE.
upon in a rather sarcastic spirit. The
Liberal press, though, has adopted,
generally speaking, a fair and more
neutral tone. The Vossiche Zeitung
printed an editorial In which it inti
mated it wished the United States
speedy success, and referred to the
"unbroken friendship existing for so
many years between the two coun
tries."
i nher Liberal papers of importance,
like the Magdeburg Zeitung and the
Weser Zeitung, express themselves in
the same vein.
Referring to the failure of the late
I sugar conference and to the agreement
| between France and the United States
regarding tariff reductions, the Kreuts
Zeitung says: "Should America refuse
to grant those tariff reductions to Ger
many and the other European states,
in spite of the most favored nation
treaties, there will be serious compli
cations. To refuse this to Germany
would be all the more unfair, since
I America was made to share, when we
, concluded our commercial treaties of
1592, In the large reductions that were
then In force, without being asked to
grant us any equivalent."
It is a well-known fact In diplomatic
circles in P.erlin that the relations be
tween the regent officer of Lippo-Det
mold and the Emperor of Germany,
have been extremely strained since the
Emperor's brother-in-law, Prince
\ Adolphof Schaumberg-Lippo wasousted
: from the office, owing to the final deci
sion rendered against him by the court
of arbitration, presided over by the
; King of Saxony, and alleged instances
lof the Emperor's ill-will toward the
now regent of Lippo-Detmold have
i been current here for some time past.
P.ut matters have not assumed a pass
which makes the affair one of national
magnitude
Count Ernest, the present regent, has
been repeatedly slighted by the Em
peror lately, in such a way as to have
induced him to seek redress before the
i forum of the Bundesrath, before which
i the Emperor is no more than the regent
of Lippo-Detmold. The regent of Lip
po-Detmold has, therefore, brought his
sovereign's complaint formally before
the Bundesrath, begging that the Em
peror may be held to render to the re
gent of Lippo-Detriiold, the measure of
respect which the constitution of the
! Empire says is his due. The regent,
at the same time, sent strongly worded
detailed autograph letters to all the
other rulers of Germany, in which, af
ter setting forth the instances of seri
ous slight to which he claims to have
been subjected, he summons all the
| German sovereigns to see that Justice
|is done him. He also says that what
â â  has happened to him may happen to
them next and that the Emperor, by
I outraging the principle of legitimacy
i In his case, endangers the very founda
tion on which the thrones of all the
[ German sovereigns rest.
The Emperor has recalled the Prus
sian representatives at the court of
Detmold. The last straw, the one which
Induced the Regent of Lippo-Detmold i
to appeal to the Bundesrath, vu
brought about by the refusal of the
officers of the Detmold garrison to pay
to the members of the family of the
Regent the honors the latter consid
ered due, whereupon ha vainly ap
pealed to the general in command, and i
the latter referred the whole matter to
Emperor William, who sent the Regent j
the following reply: "My general has
orders to render to the Regent what
belongs to the Regent, nothing more.
As for the rest, I object to the tone in
which you have allowed yourself to
couch your letter."
A comprehensive bill, providing for a
number of Important changes in the
German army, is still being drafted by
the Ministers of War and Finance, but
Its provisions are in no way settled.
However, whatever changes in the
army the Reichstag may be asked to
sanction will be for rive years.
The Emperor and the War Ministry
are greatly elated at the recent returii3
of the French general staff, showing

The officials of the War Department

PROBLEM OF

Their Disposition Under
Consideration.
NO POLICY YET FORMED
EUROPEAN POWERS AWAIT OUR
ANNOUNCEMENT.
As There Is No Alarm Over the
Present Attitude of Germany
Dewey Will not Need
Battle-Ships.
Special Dispatch to The Call. â¢
NEW YORK, July 23.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: President McKinley and
his advisers are struggling with the
problem of final disposition of the Phil
ippines. No settled policy has yet been
determined upon except the necessity
of retaining a coaling station on the
islands. Beyond that the developments
of the future must determine what
shall be done. Reassured of Germany's
neutrality by the visit of the German
Embassador and by representations
made by the German Government to
the American Embassador in Berlin,
the authorities do not consider it so
Important to reinforce Rear Admiral
Dewey with battle-ships, as Secretary
Long said to me some days ago would
be done. Rear Admiral Dewey'a fleet
will be increased in the next ten days
by the monitor Monterey and a few
days thereafter by the Monadnock.
and with these the authorities believe
he will be able to cope with the Ger
man force should developments of the
future indicate, as does not now seem
to be the case, that the Berlin Govern
ment proposes to take a hand in the
final disposition of the islands. I talked
to-day with a prominent diplomat who
is well versed in the Eastern situation.
"At the present time," he said, "com
plications with the insurgents seem
more probable than trouble with a
third power. Aguinaldo has a very un
savory record, and Consul "Wildman.
who introduced him to Rear Admiral
Dewey, probably knew it. I suppose it
was desirable to exhaust the Spanish
by attacks from the Insurgents, but it
would have been better, the develop
ments show, had Aguinaldo nÂ»t been
returned to the Philippines.
â¢'lt seems to me that the United
States should make haste to declare its
policy with respect t<Â» the islands. If
they are to be returned to Spain, the
United States must dwlare its inten
tion to assist Spain in holding them.
Otherwise there will be a general grab
in which all the powers will partici
pate. Germany may be unable to se
cure the consent of Europe to inter
fere with the operations of the Ameri
cans because of Russia's alliance with

SMALL BIDDERS GET
ALL OF THE BONDS
Only Applicants for Lots of Less
Than Five Thousand Dollars
Will Be Successful.
NET YORK, July 23.â A Washington
special to the HeVald says: Applicants
for war bonds in lots of $5000. of v
there are thousands in New
alone, need hope no longer. They will
not get even the small percentage of
the bonds for whic!. they have sub
scribed. Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury Vanderlip told me this after
noon that while final figures as to the
not receive any bonds whatever. The
entire issue of $200,000,000 will be ab
allotment of bonds could not yet be
given out, he could now say positively
that subscribers for lots r' $5000 would
sorbed by subscribers for amounts of
less than $5000.
It is known that a considerable num
ber of bonds have been purchased for
speculative purposes, as was unavoid
able, in spite of all precautions adopted
by the department to prevent it. The
officials believe, however, that the
great majority of small subscribers
were investors, and that the amount of
the Issue that will find .its way into the
hands of financial institutions and
banks will be much smaller than would
have been the case had subscribers for
lots of $5000 and $10,000 received their
bonds.

Under another call several counties in
the ountains would stand a chance of
getting larger representation than they
were able to secure under the first and
second requisition for troops. Nothing
in a military sense could be more un

DEATH IN CAMP.
Pathetic Incident in Connection
With the Demise of a Seventh
California Soldier.
Five deaths have marked the last two
days at ('amp M'-rrltt.
On Friday James E. Stafford, Company
C, First Tennessee, died from a compli
cation of pneumonia and measles, and
Cecil Flowers, Company L, Twentieth
Kansas, died from spinal meningitis.
â¢onlay Curtis S. liollins. Company
X, and Louis W. Baker, Com
pany L, Seventh California, ex
pired after a week's suffering from pneu
monia. The same malady also caused the
death of Corpora] I>. S. Newsome, Com
pany H. Fifty-first lowa.
A pathetic incident attaches to the
death of young Rollins of the Seventh.
His father arrived yesterday from San
Bernardino to visit his boy and see how
well he stood up under a soldier's life.
He presented himself at the guard tent
of the regiment and upon asking for his
son was abruptly told by a thoughtless
guard thai the boy had just passed away.
With a heart-broken moan the old gen
tleman buried his face Jn his hands and.
fell senseless to the ground. All day yes
terday he tossed in hysterical grief and
the result of the blow Is greatly feared.
In the death of Corporal Newsome the
lowas lose one of th<>ir best soldiers
from the ranks. Although a sergeant
major of the State organization he enlist
ed as a private at the lirst call. He was
studious, v,"ii up in drill and tactics, and
had a future of promise. His death has
caused widespread grief among his com
rades.
The remains of private Stafford of Ten
nessee v/ere Interred yesterday at the
Presidio.
RIO JANEIRO SAILS.
As She Passes Along the Water
Front She Receives the Usual
Enthusiastic Send-Off.
At 0 o'clock yesterday morning Major
General Men-Jam, accompanied by Major
Rathbone, left military headquarters and
proceeded to the water front, where at
the Clay street wh.-irf he met Brigadier
on Gray Ot;. . to whom he
gave final instructions :.^ to th< voyage
of the City of Rio Janeiro to Manila by
the way of Honolulu. A few minutes
later General Otis stepped on board the
stenmer Gengral McDowell and was con
veyed to the HIo Janeiro.
At about 10:30 the anchor of the trans
port was hoisted and Btae began moving
slowly toward the Golden Gate. She pass
ed close in to the water front, and was
heartily cheered by the crowds collected
on the various wharves, and the music
of the First South Dakota band and the
cheers of the soldiers were distinctly
heard In response. The port side of the
steamer was crowded with the departing
soldiers, and on the masts and yardarms
and rigging, were boys in blue, who kept
waving their handkerchiefs in answer to
similar Pignals from the shore. The
stately craft moved majestically down
the stream, presenting a beautiful sight
on the calm bay. She was given the
usual steam whistle salutes from tho va
rious craft, and at about 11 o'clock she
passed out of the Golden Gate.
The Rio Janeiro will bo followed by the

This gallant commander did not ar

After the eh iers following Colonel

In a few appropriate remarks he
thanked the Loyal Legion for the
honor that it had done him and the
people of California generally for the
hospitality that they have extended

also alluded to the excellent condition
and soldierly bearing of the men of
the First Tenneaseee. General King
was followed by Colonel Berry of the
Seventh Regiment, who spoke of the
generosity with which his command
has been treated by the Tennessee of

anthem, and a round of toasts for
the success of the flag and the safety
of the men who are carrying It to vic

CAPTAIN HODGSON HERE
Commander of the McCulloch
Ordered to Washington.
Captain W. Hodgson, of the dispatch
boat McCulloch of Admiral Dewey's
squadron at Manila, arrived from the
Orient yesterday, by way of Victoria, and
left on the afternoon train for Washing
ton, whither he had been hurriedly sum
moned by the Navy Department.
He used every .strategy to avoid re
porters, bul he was caught at Port Costa
and surrendered at discretion. In re
sponse to a Question as to whether he
had any news from Manila, he replied:
"No, I have no particular news to give
you. All I want to say of the battle Is
that Dewey came and saw and con
quered. When 1 l p f'<- Manila on June 17
everything was quiet. With reference to
the victory ;l! Manila I will say that it
was all the result of Intelligent and good
gunnery. The MeCullocto was one of the
first American boats to be fired on by
the Spanish. We went into Manila Bay
aboul midnight, and it took just two and
a half hours for Admiral Dewey's fleet
to knock them out. Then the boys had
breakfast, taking about an hour to it.
and then we started in to finish up the
irds.
"I left Manila under orders from the
department at Washington, and when 1
arrived at Hongkong I found that I
was no steamer there under the Ameri
can flag and would not be until July 5,
so I took the Empress of India, which
was the earliest, leaving on Juno 23. I rom
Vancouver I came down on the North
ern Pacific, and I am hurrying to Wash
ington as fast as I can get there.
"The American fleet cannot be too
highly praised. There has been no sick
ness, but the rainy season has just start
ed in and I cannot tell what may hap
pen.
"So far as the Philippines are con
cerned, I think the war is over. Dewey
would have defeated the Spaniards even
if they had forty fleets. Dewey is king
down "there. I brought Agulnaldo to
Manila from Hongkong, after I had car-
ried to Hongkong the first news of the
victory at Manila. Aguinaldo is a bright
young man. about 28 years old, and. was
â ted in Paris, 1 believe. I don't
think there will be any trouble down
there."
itain Hodgson said he did not know
what significance, if any, should be at
tached to his call to Washington. He did
not know why he had been summoned,
li.- was "f the opinion that the Philip
pines would be a rather rich acquisition
for the United States, and he would ad
vise young Americans to go thither. In
mercantile pursuits in that country there
cts, but Ameri
cans did not know much about the isl
ands.
It is believed that the captain has been
summoned for a conference with Presi
dent McKinley and the Secretary of the
Navy, and that he bears important dis
patches from Admiral Dewey with refer
ence to the attitude of Aguinaldo and the
army of the insurgents.
EIGHTH CALIFORNIA.
Chaplain Oliver C. Miller Will
Assume His Duties With
Services To- Day.
CAMP BARRETT, Sather Station, July
23. â The following- order was Issued at
regimental parade this evening:
. .arters Eighth Regiment, California,
United States Volunteer Infantry, Camp
Barrett, July 23, IS'JB.
Order No. 3.
1. In compliance with Instructions contained
In telegram dated July 21, 1898, to the United
States mustering oflicer, Sather, California,
Major Albert K. Whltton, Eighth California
United States Volunteer Infantry, ta hereby
detailed as recruiting officer for the regiment.
Major 'U'hitton will report to the regimental
commander for instructions.
2. In order to equalize the distribution
among companies of the enlisted men serving
as band musicians the following transfers are
hereby made, viz.: Private Joseph Bettencourt
from Company C to Company A; Private James
W. Byrnes from Company E to Company D;
Private W. J. Blumberg from Company F to
Company L,; Private Eugene Finane from Com
pany I to Company A. By order
COU3i;EL HENSHAW.
P. A. SMITH. First Lieutenant, Eighth Regi
ment, California, United States Volunteer in
fantry, Adjutant.
The detailing of Major Whltton as a
recruiting officer is for the purpose of
having some one who can Bwear in any
musicians or others who may be wanted.
Several companies have men who, for
one reason or another, could not be
mustered In with the company, but who
have been carried right along on the
rolls. Any of these yet unmustered can
now be mustered into the volunteer
service.
Chaplain Oliver C. Miller arrived in
camp this afternoon in his new uniform,
and will hold the first religious service
as a regimental officer from 9 to 10 ta
morrow (Sunday). It is more than prob
able that there will be two services each
Sunday hereafter, but It is not likely that
more than one will be held to-morrow.
The matter of attendance on services is
left optional with the men of the regi
ment. \There are a number of earnest
Christians in the regiment, who will as
sist the chaplain in conducting the meet
ings. This evening Rev. Mr. Bovard of
the Alameda Methodist church conducted
services in the >tmy Christian Commis
sion tent. It developed to-day that while
the army regulations requireÂ»the band to
play sacred music for religious services,
there is no provision for the purchase of
any music, and to get it there must be
an appeal to the public or friends of the
regiment. The band will not play at to
morrow's services on this account.
The regiment has received all of its
equipment except shoes, and they are ex
pected early next week. In this it has
done better than any of the three which
preceded it or any which has come from
another State. All of the honor is laid
on Lieutenant Colonel Carrington's shoul
ders, as he, having been a regular army
officer, understood the methods, and bene
fiting by his experience, placed the requi
sitions so that -they were filled at once.
The first serious Illness in camp is that
of Private Yon Hootte, of Company D,
San Jose. . He was brought to the hos
pital yesterday with pneumonia, and it
was feared the case would be fatal, but
the developments of twenty-four hours
have been favorable, and if all goes well
he mny recover.
Company F, Captain L. E. "Wenk, Oak
land, was presented with a commodious
dining tent to-day by the, Oakland Red
Cross Society. The gift is greatly ap
preciated, as heretofore the men have
had to eat standing out of doors. Now
tables and benches will be arranged and
the meals enjoyed in a more homelike
manner.
The band, under the leadership of Chief
Musician Gomez, has so advanced in its
work that a public concert will be given
to-morrow (Sunday) afternoon from 2 to
3:30 o'clock In front of Colonel Henshaw's
headquarters..
The detail to-night for guard duty con
sisted of Captain 11. L. Partridge, Com
pany B, San Jose, officer of the day; Lieu
tenant J. G. Estep. Company H, Redding,
officer of the guard, and Lieutenant W.
H. Cobbledick. Company F, Oakland,
super officer of the guard. .

Adjutant-General of the State
Coming Here to Inspect
Camp Merritt.
The impression has gone abroad In the
East that General Merriam and the au

the actual condition of things at the camp
have caused an immense amount of worry
In the homes of the regiments that have
been quartered here and have precipi
tated an avalanche of influence at Wash

betterment of things.

toward the eradication of the conditions
existing, as is demonstrated by the fol

Exciting Scene on Golden Gate
Avenue Marked by the
Bravery of Two
Policemen.
Through r s of the boy driver
of a : , kgon-aod a citizen and the
bravery af two poHce officers two bold
daylight burglars were captured yester
day â  -md taken to the City
Prison. They -are Jack Smith, an ex

Shortly after noon yesterday Mrs. Ro
ele Abrams, 222 U. Grove street, left her
house to go downtown, Her daughter
remained In the house for about an hour
later and then left, after seeing that all
the doors were locked and the windows
securely fastened.
Mrs. '.Abrams returned to the house
about 3 o'clock and on opening the front
door waa surprised to see a number of.
papers strewn along the hallway. She
made straight for the kitchen and was
confronted by two men. She promptly
wheeled round and rushed for the front
door, screaming as she ran. One of the
men. whom she later identified as Smith,
followed her and threatened to kill her
If she did not. stop. She managed to
throw ppen the frori door and rushed
down the steps into the â¢ street, still
screaming.
The two burglars slipped out of t.hÂ« i
house by the rear door and ran through ;
an alley, adjoining the house, to the :
street. Several of the neighbors, hearing !
Mrs. Abrams" screams, ran out of their
houses and H. G. Benedict.a cigar man,
who was visiting a friend a few doors
away, was among the number. He asked
a boy who was driving a laundry wagon
if he had seen the two burglars and the >
boy told him they had gone down the I
street and turned into Van Xess avenue.
Benedict jumped into the wagon and
requested the boy to drive along to see '
if he could recognize them. When they
got to Polk and Grove streets they saw
the burglars emerging from a vacant lot
that runs from Birch avenue to Fulton
street. They kept the burglars in Bight
as they walked rapidly along Fulton
to Polk, up Polk to McAllister, along Mc-
Allister to Larkin and up Larkin to Gold
en Gate enue.
At the corner of McAllister and T,arkin
Benedict jumped from the laundry wagon
and telling the boy to follow the men,
ran Into the Central Police station. He '
.met Louis Rattigan, the patrol wagon
driver, and told him of the burglary. Po
liceman Hostetter happened to be in the
station at the time and he and Benedict
ran for the laundry wagon, while Po
liceman Coughlin and Rattigan made a |
Â£>reak for the; patrol wag-on.
The laundry wagon got to the burglars <
first, who had by this time reached be- i
low Leavenworth street. Hostetter and
Benedict jumped off the wagon and Hos- |
tetter made for the burglars. Thomas
drew a revolver, but Hostetter was too
quick for him and grabbed his wrist be
fore he could fire.
Benedlct made 3. rush for Smith, but
Smith presented a revolver at him and,

Coughlin just tlien arrived on the |

to Hostetter: 'Don't shoot; I will get him
al! right."
Smith bolted into the barn of the Pa
cific Coast Horse Repository and took
door. Coughlin had j
not lost sight of him. and when he saw

GRAPE-NUTS.
A New and Highly Nutritious
Food.
The odd-sounding- name is used to
designate a peculiar food, made not
exactly In the shape of nuts, but hav-
ing a pleasant, nutty flavor and crisp
brittlencM that makes them a charm-
Ing favorite with the palate.
<>f y>t more value than the taste Is
the food value of Grape-Nuts. They
are largely composed of grape-sugar
dictionary can tell you about
that), an'l those who use them will find
the morning meal has not only
pleasant, but has been quickly and
easily digested; for grape-sugar is an
article produced in the human body at
one stage of the dig) stion of food, and
Is at once ready for transformation
into good healthy blood and npurish-
ment.
It should not be understood that the
grape-sugar, of which Grape-Nuta is
made, has been produced In the hu-
man body. Hut this grape-sugar is
made by much the same process as the
body employs, and is produced by
natural treatment of grains without
any foreign BUbstance whatever. It
1? made by the Postum Co. at Battle
Creek, Mich. The result is perhaps
the* most highly nutritious food ever
produced.
Grocers keep Grape-Nute.

Stockbroker's Ticker
That Failed.
BOLD SCHEME OF BAD MEN
SUCCESSFULLY DUPED A NUM
BER OF CITIZENS.
W. D. Valentine, the Tkiain Manipula
tor, Being Sought For by the
Police â The Accomplice
Landed in Jail.
Through the efforts of Sergeant Martin
a clever scheme to fleece the unwary has
been discovered.
The principal culprits, so the police
claim, are W. D. Valentine and Murk
Burke. Valentine conducts a brokerage
business at 19 Ellis street, and Burke is
his clerk.
The latter Is under arrest for conduct
ing a broking game, and a warrant is out
for Valentine's arrest on a similar
charge. Notwithstanding that several
policemen were detailed to find him. up
to midnight he had not been arrested.
According to the police Valentine rented
a room in the Parrott building on Market
street, and had numerous wires put in,
which connected with his place on Kills
street A woman named Frankie Payne
ted the wires, and. according to the
police, sin? would telegraph him the quo
tations of the Eastern market, which
placed on a large board. The buy
unking that Valentine was receiv
ing his information from the East,
gathered around the board and ex
changed the usual good-luck greetings.
It unfortunately happened that all the
customers lost, and, becoming Buspicioua
several of them notified Sergeant Martin.
The latter summoned Policemen Chappel
and Walsh, and ordered them to make an
investigation.
Accompanied by an electrician named
William Goodman, the officers yesterday
afternoon went to the room in the Parrott
building, and. after considerable trouble,
gained an entrance. The Payne woman
was seated at an electrical table en
gaged in sending "quotations" to Valen
tine. Presumably recognizing the officers,
.she quickly "fixed" the table so thai
Coalman could not operate it. The
table, ticker, wires and other accessories
such as are used by "stock brokers" were
confiscated and subsequently removed to
h< aduuarters.
It is claimed that a number of unsus
pecting citizens wire mulcted out of va
rious Bums by the schemers.
A policeman named W. E. Rice, who
assisted in the arreÃt, is apparently de
termined to shield Valentine. When
asked last night why he had not arrested
him he grew belligerently Indignant, and
declared that he knew his own business.
Rice has been on the force for about
a year, and If what his fellow patrolmen
true, he is anxious to become a de
tective. It is possible that <'hief I -,
realizing his worth, will invoke his as
sistance in finding the brutal murderer of
Mrs. Carpenter.
FISH YARNS ARRIVING.
How Some of the Local Sports Are
Enjoying Themselves in the
Country.
Ed Briggs, the tobacconist. Is enjoying
the beautiful climate of Monterey County.
A friend of Ed wrote Jim Chesley a few
days ago of a terrible accident which be
fell Briggs while casting artificial flies
on the beautiful River Suir. The letter
goes: "We fished until our arms grew
weary whipping water, and not a fish
was caught until high noon, when one
of the boys concluded to send up smoke
by building a bonfire, on which our cof
fee and other good things agreeable to
the inner man were to be made warm and
palatable.
"Ed was fishing near the spot where
the camp fire was started, and as one
of the boys remarked: 'How lovely a
trout would taste when fried on those
hot coals,' Briggs shouted: 'I've got
'em!'
"Sure enough, Ed had a whopper on
lils hook, and after a desperate and ex
citable battle the fish was landed right
.Â«!<!>â¢ up witfi care and flung quickly into
the basket for keeps.
" 'Bring him this way, Ed, old boy,'
Shouted the r'.reman. 'I've got a redhot
Btone here ready for the reception of the
salmor.
"Briggs acquiesced quickly, and after
the broiled rock was wiped clean Angler
Ed gently placed the trout on the im
provised cooking stove.
"Scarcely had Mr. Gteelhead. or salmon
trout, more commonly called, felt the beat
of the stone than up it sprang in the air
and with a flap of its tall as a iast good
by, dropped back into the stream out of
sight, but not out of mind of the lone
fisherman, who had angled for four long
and weary hours in the hope of catching
a supply of trout sufficient for a sweet
noonday mess on the banks of the Suir.
Briggs is now homesick."

DEMOLISHED A TROLLEY CAR,
San Jose Express Train Crashed Into an Electric Car
and Sent It Spinning Twenty-Five Feet
Against a Telegraph Pole,
THE San Jose express, southbound, crashed into electric car No. 1121 of the
Solano and Sixteenth street line yesterday morning and was derailed. The
car was demolished, and the escape of the motorman, J. L. Meeks, and
Conductor Stanley was miraculous. The accident occurred at the crossing
at Sixteenth and Harrison streets, and the electric car came dashing down
the grade from Bryant street. Those who witnessed the collisionâ among
them J. H. Terrill of the John Kelso Companyâ say that Signalman A. Blake had
the guards down and was ringing his bell to warn everybody of the approaching
train, which was a double header. The motorman was grappling with his brakes,
which seemed to be unmanageable, and the car dashed through the guard and
upon the track. The car was struck fairly in the center and thrown fulh- twenty
live feet, hurled against a lamp post and telegraph pole, knocking those down and
rebounding toward the train. The conductor jumped for his life, but Motorman
Meeks stuck to his post and was found pinned beneath one of the seats.
He was extricated and removed to St. Luke's Hospital, 4 suffering from an
ugly deep gash over his left eye, besides numerous superficial scalp wounds. After
the wounds were dressed by the hospital physicians he was turned over to the
railway physicians. Fortunately there were no passengers on the car. The mo
torman claims that the brakes failed to work.
The express was going at the rate of 10 miles per hour, and tho head engine's
two leader wheels and two drivers lost their bearings. A large hole was punched
into the water tank, the cowcatcher was demolished and other damages were sus
tained by locomotive 1959, amounting to over $1000.
Meeks' attending physicians say that they *â¢Â«"Â« hoifi" of his recovery, pro
vided no "serious Internal injuries develop.

doves and dovelets in the vicinity of their

what is called the gumboot bait. How
ever, the following letter from Katzen

thusly:
Well, jresterday morning a party of five left
the hotel fully equipped and went hunting.
I shot two tleer and any quantity of doves and
cottontails with a Mauser rifle. I was the
lucky one; pretty good for me, eh? But my

Army Christian Commission
The Young People's societies of the
various churches are pouring a stream of
usefulness into the work of the Chris-
tlan Commission, co-operating in air lines.
It is expected auxiliaries of the commis
sion will be organized in many of the
larger cities of the State within the next
few days. The work is extending in all
directions, and is of such importance an
appeal is made to the public for funds
for its prosecution. The possibilities of
the work can be limited only by lack of
means for its support. Requests for
various lines of the work are constantly
coming to the notice of the commission
from the young men in the service. Evan
gelist Crlttenton will be at Camp Merritt
this week for four nights, Tuesday,
Wednesday. Thursday and Friday, and
will probably Bpeak in the lowa Regiment
and at the Mothers' Club. Many letters
are being received from various parts of
the country expressing high appreciation
of the work of the commission, especially
from the mothers. Contributions re
ceived yesterday were: Trinity Presby
terian Church, San Francisco, $13 35;
David Jacks, Monterey, $100: First Pres
byterian Church, Santa Barbara, $20 60;

DOCKED AMID
DIFFICULTIES
Transport Arizona Given
a Berth.
CENTENNIAL ALSO LAID UP
ANOTHER INSPECTION OF THE !
LATTER BOAT.
How Two Young Ladies Saw the Out
going Transport â The Bush
Goes to Mare
Island.
After a great deal of maneuvering Chief
Whariinger Root succeeded in getting a
berth for the big transport Arizona at
Folsom-street wharf. Owing to her great
length she required 475 feet of dock space
and also thirty feet of water in which to
maneuver.
The tugs Sea King and Reliance moved
her in from the stream yesterday, but as
the barkentine S. G. Wilder was on the
same side of the wharf the Arizona will
not be properly docked until to-day.
The Wilder will be moved out into the
stream and the Arizona will be moved
about twenty feet further up the dock.
As it is now her stern overhangs the
wharf about twenty feet.
The steamer Centennial also docked at
I Folsom-street wharf yesterday. She came
I down from Hunters Point drydock, where
} she had again been examined by the
United States authorities. On the sugges
tion of the Inspector of Hulls und Boilers
I new plates are to be put in the Cen
\ tennlal's boliers, und it Is then thought i
; that the Government will accept her as a
transport.
The docking of the Arizona and the
Centennial at Folsom-streei wharf will j
put the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company to a little trouble. SSpear
street wharf, where this company's ves
sels usually dock, is undergoing repairs,
I and latterly the vessels have been going !
] there to discharge their inward freight I
: and passengers and then going to
I Folsom-street wharf to load. All the coal
i and a considerable (juantity of freight for
the Columbia due to-day from Portland
Is lying on Folsom-street wharf, and at
first it was thought that the O. R. and N.
Company would have to cart It around to
Spear street. Assistant Chief Wharfinger
Scott, however, found a way out of the
difficulty. When the Columbia is ready to
go to Folsom street the Centennial will be
warped out into the dock in order to
allow the Columbia to get alongside the
wharf. The Centennial will then tie up
alongside the Columbia until the latter
has received her freight and passengers,
after which she will go to sea.
With the advent ut the State of Cali
fornia the O. R. and N. steamers' will dis
charge and receive freight at Spear
street wharf.
There was considerable enthusiam
along the water front over the departure
.of the Rio Janeiro lor Manila. Among |
I the crowds at the end of Howard-street
Wharf was an old Frenchman, who got I
very excited when he saw the transport I
| Â»et under way. H, ; waved his handiter- !
chief and hurrahed frantically for a few '
.. mmules and then he subsided and re- i
I turned the handkerchief to his pocket, j
' J )W Â» the Fr enchman had' two handker- !
; chiefs. Onv of th< m was for general usu
j and in the other he hud $2 50 done up for
I safekeeping. Unfortunately for him when
i his enthusiam again got the better of him
Ihe pulled out the handkerchief which i
contained the money, and the $2 50 scat- !
! tered among the crowd. There was a i
wild scramble and |1 50 was returned to
the old man, but a young follow named
Thomas Bheeban, who had picked up a
dollar, ran away with It. Officer George I
Lake, who had witnessed the scene, at i
once gave chase and caught Sheehan at '
iolsoin-strw't wharf. When caught the j
thief returned the dollar to the old man.
but Lake would not let him off. He was
t liken to the Harbor Police Station and
i charged with petty larceny.
Mrs. Andrews, the matron at the Har
i bor Receiving Hospital, was very much !
exercis-d over the manner In which two
young ladies whom she saw on the wharf ;
during the morning, got aboard the State !
j tug Governor Markham. The tug went!
; out with Adjutant General Barrett and a '
I number of army officers to the Rio de I
Janeiro and ten minutes after she had I
disappeared under a full head of steam i
the young ladles put in an appearance
on the wharf. The tug did not come back
to the landing again until the Rio de Jan
eiro had put to sea. Nevertheless, when!
she came back to land her passengers
the first to step off her were the two i
young ladies, who, according to Mrs. An
drews, hud missed their boat. Mrs An
drews is still wondering how they got i
on board, but the matter is easy of ex- â 
planatlon. The young ladles are friends â 
of Assistant Chief Whartlnger Scott, and I
the sight of their disappointed faces was
too much for him, so he hired a white
hall and rowed them out into the stream
There he was lucky enough to Intercept
the Markham and put them aboard.
It was awful hnrd work rowing, as Mr
Scott's hands will testify. There are three i
big blisters on each palm and Harry will i
carry this memento of his gallantry for i
several days to come.
The United States steamer Rush went
to Mare Island yesterday afternoon. Or
ders came to her captain during the
morning nnd as soon as steam was got
up the vessel ggt under way and steamed
up through Raccoon Straits. It Is be
lieved that she has gone to the navy
yard to have a battery of modern rapid
fire guns put aboard.
About three thousand women crossed
the bay on the 11 o'clock trip of the
Tiburon yesterday. They are the moth
ers, sisters, aunts and cousins of the
League of {he Crocs Cadets now en
camped at Santa Rosa. They will spend i
the day with their relatives at Camp I
Montgomery and will return with them 1
on a special train this afternoon.
A truce was declared yesterday by
Quarantine Officer Craw of the State
Board of Horticulture and the commis
sion merchants. In consequence none of
the wormy fruit that came on the Sac
ramento River steamers yesterday
morning was thrown overboard The
commission merchants ask for a delay
until to-morrow morning in order to no
tify their clients on the river, nnd they
were given the time asked for. Mr. Craw
was very willing to grant their request
when they explained that this practice
of shipping wormy and Inferior fruit to
San Franclsgo had been going on for
years nnd that It was only fair that the
farmers should be notified that the prac- I
tlce should stop. Some of the commis- i
sion merchants took a very high handed
stand with the State quarantine man nnd
at one time threatened to throw him off I
the wharf. Mr. Crnw, however, pointed
out to them that there was a fine of
|8000 or Imprisonment for five years nt
tcched to Interfering with a State of
ficer In the execution of his duty. So the
commission merchants enme to" the con
clusion that Quarantine Officer Craw was
a good man to leave alone.

A HEAVY TAX
ON NEW WINE
Scott Rules on Bottled
Goods.
LOCAL DEALERS AROUSED
DEATH BLOW TO CALIFORNIA'S
CHERISHED INDUSTRY.
War Stamps Should not Be Put on
Bottles Until the Wines Are
Beady to Go on the
Market.
Treasury Department, Office of Com
missioner of Internal Revenue, Washing
ton, D. C, July 5. 189S.â Sir: Tysen & Tot
ten, 24 Dey street. New York City, have :
written to this office under date of June :
25, stating that they have large bins in !
their cellars and it Is their custom to
have on hand thousands of bottles of
wine, which are kept to age. They also
state these are not ready for sale, as they
are simply corked and have no caps or
labefc. which cups or labels are to be af
fixed when sold and ready to be delivered.
They further state that they do not bot
tle these wines themselves. The wines
are sent to a regular bottler, and he is
paid for bottling. They ask when they
bottle wines in this way, without caps
and labels, to be placed in bins, if it is ;
necessary for them to stamp them at that
time, or if they can wait until capped and
labeled for sale.
They have been referred to you. You
will please advise thorn that this office
rules in such a case that when the wine
lias lM>en bottled It be regarded as having
been bottled for sale, and the stamps
must be affixed to such bottles at the !
time of bottling, no mutt'-r how long aft
erward they may be kept for aging pur
poses. Ripnectfully yours,
ft. B. SCOTT, Commissioner.
r l his ruling of Commissioner Scott has
set all of the wine men of California into
a frame of mind anything but pleasant.
Not that they wish in any man
ner to avoid paying their portion
of the war tax, but the terms
and conditions imposed by the
ruling power at Washington are such
that, they contend, will deal a death
blow to the wine Industry . of this and
every State if not modified. All of the
wine' men and bottlers are charitable
enough to believe that the Commissioner
is wholly ignorant of the wine business,
or he would never have made such a
rule. Some idea of the terrible burden it
fastens upon this Industry may be had
from the remarks of two of the leading
dealers of this cityâ Arpad Haraszthy, oi
the sparkling wines, and Charles E.
Bowen, of the sweet and dry wines.
Mr. Haraszthy does not believe that
this ruling should be taken seriously. He
said:
There surely must have been some mistake In
this matter. Why, if that would follow every
champagne house In the United States would
have to .r'. "in â¢>: business within twenty-four
hours. The putting of the wines In bottles In
the first plaoe la not bottling in the sense
of the act, it Is a portion of the making of the
chamiiaitne. Wo are obliged to keep thÂ«Â» stuff In
bottles for two or three years before we know
what we have. In that length of time every
bottle has to be handled about 850 times a year.
Down In the damp cellars where this work is
done the stamps would not stay on the corks
but a short time before rubbing off. and then

them to take my business, pay my dsbts and let
me get out at once. The idea of trying to
compel us to put a stamp on every bottle of
champagne before it Is ready for the market
is about as sensible as it would be to make a
rough estimate of the amount of wine In a
grape press and assess us on such an esti
mate. As I said, in this line it is not w:ne
until It is ready' for the trade, and I know that
the law did not contemplate taxing tho crude
stuff In every stage of its manufacture, for
that Is what such a ruling would be. T am
sure that when the injustice of this matter Is
called to the attention of the CommlÃsloner he
will surely modify his decision. I will willingly
pay the contemplated tax. but the business
cannot stand the stamp on every curk. propo
sition.
The position of Charles E. Bowen of the
"Wetmore-Bowen Company Is similar 10
that of the champagne man. He sa!d
that the sweet and dry wines are kept in
bottles for three and four years In order
to determine what kind of an article the
grape juice makes. It Is not Infrequent
that whole lots of hundreds of gallons
have to be drawn off and clarified again.
If this had to be done with a lot of 10.000
or 20,000 bottles, the bottler would have
to pay a double tax, a thing that the
act does not contemplate. His firm bot
tles about 1000 casea of ten and twenty
four Quart bottles to the case
erery month, and these are stored
In bins holding 20,000 bottles, to
be kept for three and four years.
While in the bins the bottles are naked -
that is. they have no labels or caps on
the corks, and while in this condition the
wines are not for sal'">. because the ar
ticle Is in process of .manufacture. Then,
too. there are leaky corks, which would
destroy stamps, and breakage, and a tax,
according to Mr. Bowen. would be most
unjust on the raw. unfinished wines. The
gentl* man is of the opinion that the Com
missioner has made a great mistake
through his ignorance of the process of
manufacture of wines; moreover, that he I
lias made a ruling that exceeds the spirit !
and intent of the act. In schedule B. tho i
tax on wines Is set forth in a very brief
and concise manner, to th-? effect that
"sparkling or other wines, when bottled I
for sale, upon each bottle containing one |
pint or less, 1 cent: upon each bottle con- |
tainlng more than one pint, 2 cnt.~."
''That is the law," said Mr. Bowen,
"and if the words 'for sale' hava any
meaning, they mean exactly what they
say. Wines in bins are l.ot for sale, and
when they are ready to go on the mar
ked, then it the time to pa/ tho (ax
theieon. ami not before. It would be as
juf-t *.o lax the grapes on the vne* at 1
cent per bottle, for we can come pretty
near tti! the amount of vine a eor
tuiii quantity of grapes will maka, a.3 to
compel us to pay by the botti^. i;r>:ii wo
kr.iHv how many bottles we wiil save in
the m:'l<l:ipr. I am sure that when tuQ
abwrdity of this rule is mi'ie apparent
to those who have the say in Buch things
It will be rrodined so as to coma within
he rnennmg of the a.ct." .
A mnnter of other wine men rtiscucs-ed
the rr.ftT.ier lr the same manner, deolar
ing that the ruling Is the "worst kind of
an injustice, and would drive many out
of business. However, they all seem to
be waiting for the case to be called to the
attention of the Commissioner in its
ri^ht light, believing that he will see the
injustice of taxing the wine men many
times, and modify his ruling.

As The Call predicted, there were some
surprises yesterday during the run-down
of the puppy stake, but out of the twenty
cours< The Call tipped n f teen winners,
which is a display of tolerably good judg
ment, considering: the unreliable running
of puppies. Belle of Seville defeated
Blacklock, a strong favorite; the winner
was a Call selection. Then Golden Rus-
Bett. another Call tip, sent the favorite.
Brandy and Soda, to his kennel after a
good drubbing. Minerva, tipped to win
against Brutus, met with signal defeat.
Brutus was a 1 to 10 shot, and to the sur
prise of first class judges he led from the
slips, scored first turn and held a good
lead until the hare was picked up In a
drive by Minerva. The loser appeared In
the slips in poor condition, and did not.
by any means, run up to her accustomed
form.
The next upset came when the speedy
bitch Lalla Rookh, the property of John
Kerrigan, was upset by Macs Melody.
The owner stated that Lalla Rookh had
taken sick on Friday evening, but had
seemingly feeling well when she was
handed over to the slipper. She certainly
ran out of form, allowing xvlacs Melody
to put several lengths between her and
the hare in the run-up to game. She sold
a 5 to 2 favorite.
Sunburst ran a short but fast race. pick-
Ing up his game on a straight run and
leaving Yosemite wondering whether the
hare had suddenly taken wings..

THEY MUST PUT ON STAMPS
COMMISSIONER SCOTT of Internal Revenue
Has Instructed Collector Lunch That
Express Companies and Other Carriers
Must Place the War Stamp on
Bills of Lading.
In order to settle the question a* to the duty of express companies find
other common carriers in relation to th.- payment of the stamp tax on bills
of lading. Ford H. Thomas, representing the John D. Spreckels & Bros.
Company, called upon Internal Revenue Collector Lynch yesterday and
submitted to htm the following- written question;
"Under the provisions of schedule A. war revenue law, Is it incumbent
upon shippers of merchandise or agents of foreign-bound vessels to affix
stamps to hills of lading?"
Mr. Lynch was of the opinion, as he had been all along, that the law
was plain on the matter im.l that there could be no mistaking its language
and intent. There could be no doubt that carriers were required to affix the
stamps mentioned in the law. But in order to be able to speak authorita
tively on th-> matter he wired the question to Commissioner Scott at the
headquarters of the Internal Revenue Department in Washington. In a
shurt time the following reply was received;
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 23.
Collector Lynch, San Francisco â The carrier company or its agent must
stamp bills of lading. N. B. SCOTT, Commissioner.
This opinion from the head of the department closes all controversy a3
to the obligation imposed upon Wells-Fargo's Express Company to affix the
war stamps on the bills of lading and at its expense. It is expected that
tin United States courts will rule in harmony with the opinion rendered by
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
In order to make a stronger and more complete case against the com
pany, the Merchants' Association yesterday requested United States Attor
ney Foote not to begin suit against Wells. Fargo & Co. next Tuesday, but
to postpone it until they notify him that they are ready to go on with the
case.

LOCHNER AGAIN
ON THE GRILL
He Makes a New and
Complete Statement.
NOTHING STARTLING ELICITED
JUSPECT STICKS TO HIS ORIG
INAL TALE.
Police Department Will Submit the
Case to the Coroner on the
Evidence Already
Gathered.
Police Captain Seymour had Joe T,och
ner, the suspected murderer of Sadie Car
penter, on the grill again yesterday fore
noon, but nothing new was elicited fn>:n
the prisoner. During the "sweating" pro
cess he was subjected to. Lochner made
a iir-w and complete Btatement of his con
nection with the tragedy and his rela
tlons to the victim prior to her death on
Sunday morning last.
His last and corrected Bt&temerit Is, in
substance, the same as the Interview
with Captain Seymour which was pub
lished in yesterday's Call. He reiterated
his statement that he saw the rag around
the dead woman's neck when he entered
her room with the night clerk by the re-
Oected light of lamps In front of the
Casino Saloon on Fourth street opposite
the Hubbard House. He also contradict
ed the statement of Darby Glynn that
he remained In the Bellevue Snloon flyÂ»
to fifteen minutes when he rushed in and
said. "Sadie hns been murdered," on the
morning of the crime.
Lochner also made several corrections
of his previous statements in regard to
his connection with the crime.
During the inquisition Joe brought in
the name of a lady he had met while he
was selling coupons for a photograph
gallery located on Market street. Cup
tain Seymour sent for her and she came
to his office immediately. On her arrival
Lochner was again brought up from his
cell and his statement read in the pres
ence of the lady and himself. During
the reading the suspect tldgeted in his
chair and seemed ill at ease. When rap
tain Seymour had finished, the lady in
dignantly denied the entire statement,
and turning to Lochner said: "You
despicable wretch, you lie, and you ought
to be hanged."
"What do you mean." said Captain
Seymour to Lochner, "by bringing the
name of a respectable woman into the
case, when you know you are 1-ing?"
"Well," replied Lochner, "maybe I was
mistaken. I cannot tell. I have known
so many women."
Captain Seymour took pains to Investi
gate the character of the lady referred
to by Lochner and found that she had
never seen the man but once, and that
she was a respectable woman.
Lochner also made many correc
tions of his previous statements, but
maintained that he was Innocent of
but maintained that he was innocent of
any harm to Badie. He sticks to his ver
sion of the Incidents of the night of the
murder and still maintains that Lizzie
Rlley said something about "choking" or
"strangling" when he was awakened by
the night clerk.
The police have not received any new
evidence in the case, which will be pre
sented to the Coroner's Jury on the tes
timony heretofore presented in The Call.

J. Schwarz, who was conducted from a
cell In the County Jail to the County
Clerk's office, where he was met by his
mother and the young 1 woman to whom
he was married according to the laws of
the State by Presiding Judge Belcher,
and who was then conveyed back to his
lonely prison cell to spend the honey
moon.
The brief history attending? this mar
riage is that on tho 2T>th of last June the
boy groom of yesterday, accompanied by
his mother, appeared before Deputy
County Clerk Danforth and obtained a
marriage license to wed Josephine Healy.
A reason for Schwrftz's mother accom
panying her son was that the boy was
only 19 years of age, while the age of the
Healy &irl was 18. But from the unwrit
ten pages of the case it would appear
that it was deemed bOHt that they should
get married. After the issuing of the li
cense and before the services of the unit
ing agent were called into requisition
Mrs. Sohwarz had reason to change her
mind as to the uniting of her son with
that of the Healy family. Hence the
buns were forbidden, but immediately
thereafter the services of a police officer
were called into the case with a warrant
for the arrest of Joseph J. Sehwarz for
deceiving Josephine Healy under the
promise of marriage. The preliminary
hearing wan had before Judge Conlan,
who held Schwarsc to answer before the
Superior Court, fixing his bond at $5000.
His continued confinement in the County
Jail and the inability to get him out on
bail so worked on the motherly feelings
that yesterday she weakened and gave
her consent to the marriage.
Now that Miss Heuly that was is Mrs.
Schwa rz in fact and in law, she cannot
Wstify against her husband, and as a
matter of course the case will be dropped,
but the joy of the honeymoon la spoiled,
and there is weeping at the house of Mrs.
Sohwarz instead of a scattering of rice
and a throwing of old slippers.

An Expert Verdict on the
Ball Came.
ATHLETICS PLAY HORRIBLY
THEY EMPLOY THREE PITCH
ERS USELESSLY.
San Jose Won Handily by Putting
Up Excellent Ball in Marked
Contrast to Their Op
ponents' Work.
BY JOE CORBETT.
As I am a most ardent admirer of our
great national game it is with great
reluctance that I allude to yesterday's
performance between the San Joses and
Athletics as a game of baseball. It was,
of course, in one sense, yet to an indi
vidual endowed with but the usual
amount of sagacity it appeared more like
a game of "checkers." That is, the San
Joses played baseball and the Athletics,
who have gained some little reputation
of late as a good ball team, played at it.
The difference in methods gave the game
to the first named aggregation without
even an argument.
To describe the contest as it really oc
curred would, I Blncerely believe, be im
possible; yet, as 1 must give some idea
of the game, and particularly dwell upon
that point which conveys how it was won
and lost, 1 will say that It was from be
ginning to end a complication of precipi
tate confusions.
The San Joses played almost perfectly;
that is, until after they were assured of
certain victory, and the Athletics, well,
they tried hard and lost. To give an
Idea of how hard they tried three pitchers
were necessary, and absolutely so, to
finish the game. Now, if that is not em
ploying every available means to emerge
victorious, 1 am sadly mistaken.
It was, after this "changing process"
became so common, that the Athletics
gave the impression that they were play
ing "checkers."
Fltzpatrlck made the first move at the
end of the fourth inning. Things weren't
going well with him, and he conceived the ;
idea that a graceful retirement, under the
pretense that he must pitch to-day
against the Sand Crabs, was preferable to ;
being compelled to retire amid an aval
anche of base hits and possible three
baggers.
Ins successor was a Mr. Fountain, who
has been taking care of the bats Bince
signing a Crowley & Kaplen contract.
He had a way of Bending men to iirst I
base that was really remarkable, no less
than three being given free transporta
tion in such rapid succession that the
crowd howled derisively for another
pitcher.
The crowds and their quarters account
for that new fence now going up, which,
by the way, began to turn yellow in the
middle of the- game, its hue being, no
doubt, the reflection of the Athletica" play
ing.
The entreaties of the assemblage, in
view of the above mentioned fact, could
not be ignored, so it became Mr. Foun
tain's next move. All pitchers, so far.
Looked alike to those Florists, and when
"Josh. Rellly undertook to ease the situ
ation, so to , say. by entering, the box
himself,' the game of checkers became
baseball history, and the whole affair
terminated in a "josh."
Reilly was no improvement over his
vanquished cohorts, yet his â¢ efforts to
make the game appear as near baseball
as possible were appreciated and
applauded. He certainly Is an earnest
worker, and "without him It Is needless to ]
conjecture what would happen to the |
Athletics. ,
The pitchers were not the "onllest
ones" mixed up In this game of confu
sion. They were admittedly very much
a la Perrine or Russell, but their work
fades into oblivion when confronted with
the miserable exhibition put up by those
players who are engaged to accept field
ing possibilities and make runs.
I know of no more appropriate manner
in describing their attempts (they were
nothing else) than to say that, on the
whole, they outclassed the famous "blue
ribbon" collection. This I realize is mak
ing use of some acrimony, but it is true.
They played as only the Friscos can
not the Friscos of the present, for tney
bave reformedâ but the Friscos of the
past.
It was confusion on confusion with
them all through the game. The "Flor
ists" made ten hits, yet scored aa many
runs. That In itself will give an idea of
how eoKtly some of the errors were, but
it does not convey a proper conception of
their color. Yellow is the hue, the same
as that now being put on the fence, and
the reflection must have been very strong
to inspire those painters, who were I un
derstand supposed to use black. They
cannot be censured, however, for It cer
tainly was awful, and a man could not
be blamed for killing another after leav
ing the grounds.
In the seventh inning Iborg took things
easy, and the crowd wan brought to its
feet by a rally, which, for a moment,
looked as though It would" last until sun
down. A continuity of base hits, clean
as could be, marked the lirst stages of
this inning. The spectators thought It
wan the turning point of the game, but
after four successive hits were made. In
termingled with an error or two, Iberg
started pitching again, and tho hopes of
all were shattered beyond recognition.
Four runs were scored In this inning,
and then confusion asserted itself, us pre
viously, and reigned supreme until the
end.
The work of the San Joses was really
good, despite the fact that they made six
SAM BENDIT'S GAME SHUT UP.
Collected Moneu From Unsuspecting Persons on
Pretense That He Had Fruit Consigned to
Them on Which Charges Were Due. .
For the past three months a clever young mnn named Sam Bendlt has
been coining money by a scheme that was successful from its simplicity.
He procured a number of shipping orders of the Southern Pacific Com
pany that ure equally in the possession of teamsters. He would fill In one
of these blanks with the name of his victim as consignee and showing that
a case of dried fruit was waiting for him or her at the freight sheds, gen
erally from Los Angeles. There were always certain charges to be collect
ed for demurrage running from $2 to $6. and he. with rare exceptions, suc
ceeded in getting the money. When the victim made inquiry for the fruit he
or she found that it was a swindle.
Complaints were made to the police and also to the Southern Pacific
offices, and for the past three weeks Detectives Kindelon and Lewtn of the
Southern Pacific and Detectives Ryan and ODea have been working on the
case. It was not till yesterday morning that they got a definite clew to the
swindler. They found aim on Capp street, near Twenty-third. He w;is in
the act of filling out one of the blanks when arrested. He tried to destroy,
the shipping orders, but was prevented.
When starched a number of the orders were found upon him, and also
several pawn tickets for articles that he had pawned. He admitted that he
had been working successfully on the scheme for the past three months,
and said that ho had obtained money from more than fifty people, mostly
women. He had at first a partner in Jim Blake, a race track tout, but Blake
parted from him about two weeks ago, and since then he htul been operat
ing alone. He has been ruined by # his passion for gambling. Ills family, he
said, lived at 715 Octavia street, but he had been living at 1 Fifth street.
Among his victims were Mrs. Cummings, dressmaker, 22Vs Geary street;
Mme. Marchand, hairdresser. 28 Geary; Mrs. Pless, 1.185 Folsoni street;
Mme. Drlvon, 500 Sutter street; Mrs. Maria Stacom, D?.l Sutter street; Grand
Secretary Cordy of the Foresters of America; Secretary Burgman of the Red
Men, and a large number of milliners and dressmakers. Hfc got altogether
about $200 within the three months he had been operating.
Detective Holland of Oakland says that Bendit has also been working
the people there, numerous complaints having been made to the police
about him.
He Is being detained in "the tanks," pending a full investigation and
the police say that charges of forgery will probably be made against him,
besides charges for obtaining money by false pretenses.

played hard, and again demonstrated that
they are second only to the leaders. Iberg
was invincible up to the seventh, when
he rested and whetted the appetites of his
opponents' supporters. He never per

work, all round, was admired extremely.

DR. PIERCES REMEDIES
VICTOR! ON SEA AID LAND,
INTENSE MOMENTS IN WARFARE.
WOW WOMEN BEAR THE BRUNT
OF W A ft.
During the few months we have been
at war with Spain there have been
many critical moments in which men
felt that they were living whole years!
The landing of the invading army up-
on the shores of the enemy's country
â¬?* *2*
is perhaps the most critical time for
the success or defeat of our arms. The
enemy can pour in a deadly fire upon
our men as they wade ashore, while
they may be in comparative safety
behind breastworks, unless they are
within the accurate range of our war
vessels. In every engagement our men
have shown the most heroic bravery
and steady-strong nerves coupled with
determination. When Farragut and
Cushlng taught the world, in the naval
engagements of our late war, of what
material our navy was made, we did
not expect so soon to see their counter-
parts in Dewey and Hobson.
For all the risks that are run by our
men and the critical moments they ex-
perience, and the times when they feel
their nerves stretched to the breaking
point, there is unfortunately another
tremendous nervous strain endured by
the loved ones at home, the women.
The wife, mother or sister at home sits
wearily waiting for news of those they
love â the men who are taking desper-
ate risks at the battle's front. With
fear and dread they scan the paper
to look over the names of those lost
or wounded in the last engagement.
The greatest calamity, the saddest pic-
ture of all war experiences is the dis-
aster that falls upon the weak and
helpless loved ones at home when their
hero is killed in action.
Who suffers most deeply and fearfully
from the shock of battle? Who feels
most poignantly the stabs of poverty
and privation and disease? Human life
everywhere gives the answer as in an
open book that all may read: Women
are ever the chief and sorriest victims;
the weight of misfortune falls heaviest
upon the mother and her child.
Look where you will in any corner of
America to-day and you find women
suffering such agonies from the weak-
nesses and diseases peculiar to their sex
as would make the bravest soldier fiinch
and almost hesitate to face them. Their
nervous systems are run down at a time
when they need the greatest fortitude,
strong will and nerves of steel to bear
their burdens of care.
"I believe that the sick and suffering
women of this country," says Doctor
Pierce of Buffalo, N. V., "whether in
times of war or peace, are entitled to
Just as much sympathy as we besicw
upon our military and naval heroes;
just as much care and attention and
solicitude; Just as high an appreciation
of their heroic fortitude and endur-
ance."
From his earliest practice as a young
physician thirty years ago Dr. Pierce
has always felt that the grandest and
worthiest work in the world for a phy-
sician is to raise up the suffering women
who labor under a constant burden of
sickness and discouragement and set
them upon a higher plane of physical
and mental capacity and healthful
vigor.
Among all the achievements of an
extraordinarily successful career in the
field of practical medicine that which
yields him the deepest gratification is
that he has been able to cope success-
fully with those delicate and compli-
cated diseases which render the lives of
so many wo-men miserable.
Of all hla remarkable contributions
to medical science his marvelous "Fa-
vorite Prescription" for women's com-
plaints stands easily foremost in the
world among remedies of Its class. It
has brought more perfect relief to suf-
fering women, and through them has
conferred greater benefit upon their
offspring than any other medicine ever
Invented, and probably more than all
other medicines combined.
The "Favorite Prescription" contains
no alcohol, opium or other narcotics;
no false or uncertain stimulus; does not
create a craving for injurius stimu-
lants; the power it gives is the power
of nature: it Imparts energy and nerve-
tone that Is real, healthy and perman-
ent.
"Liast February T became sick and
had a very lame and painful back
and side and I was entirely untit to
attend to my household duties," writes
Mrs. M. P. Woodman, of East New-
port, Penobscot County, Maine, to Dr.
Pierce. "My back was so lame I could
not lie down at night, but had to be
bolstered up against the head of the
bed. We called our family doctor.
He gave me medicine but it did me no
good. I became discouraged and lold
my husband I was going to write to
Dr. Pierce and see what he said about

my case. I did so and you wrote back
describing my case very plainly and
advising me to take your "Favorite
Prescription' and 'Golden Medical Dis-
covery.' I got two botties (one of each
kind), and by the time I had taken
them was well enough to do all my
housework aloneâ which is consider-
able, as I live on a farm, have a good
deal to see to, and have four small
children. I have remained well up to
this time (June 9th) and have not
taken any more medicine. I had taken
your 'Favorite Prescription' several
other times with great benefit, and I
think it is all that you claim. I shall
always take these medicines in the. fu-
ture and shall recommend them to my
friends. I thank you very much for
your careful attention to my case."
"I suffered for years from a very ag-
gravated case of female weakness,
backache, cold hands and feet, and waa
very weak and nervous," writes Mrs.
F. H. Prosens of Wellington, Wayne
Co., N. Y. "Had fainting spells, palpi-
tation of the heart and could hardly
drag around. My blood was also very
bad. Hail salt rheum in my hands.
Had a terrible pressure under shoulder
blades and my lungs were in very bad
condition. The doctors said I must have
help right away or I would have con-
sumption. I doctored a long time, but
did not seem to get any better, and my
husband wanted me to try Dr. Pierces
medicines. I did so. and after taking
the 'Favorite Prescription 1 and "Q
Medka! Discovery' I was cured of all
my complaints, and I have never been
better in my life than I have been since
taking these medicines. I think they
are the best medicines in the world.

his lungs in bad condition SO h I

Discovery 1 and it helped him right
away. We feel that we cannot say
enough for Dr. Pierces medicines. You
have my best wishes for your continued
success."
"I will express my gratitude to you
for the benefit I have received from
your 'Favorite Prescription,' " writes
Mrs. Cora Mann of Fairburn. fuster
Co., So. Dak. "When I began taking
it I could hardly r f< ot aft r

band with me, and I had less pain than

sixth child. When baby was five days
old I got up and washed and dressed
him, and got up the ninth day and
stayed up all day. It was all d

scription.
"I also gave two bottles of 'Golden
Medical Discovery' to my little girl for
a severe breaking out and I think she
is completely cured as she has not had
the trouble for over a year."
"I will send you a testimonial of the
effect of Dr. Pierces wonderful Fa-
vorite Prescription.' " says Mrs. Annie
F. Arkins. of Stevenson (Green Spring
Valley), Baltimore Co., Md. "I am the
mother of five children and have suf-
fered very much, mostly from female
weakness. Before my last child waa
born I saw thÂ» advertisement of Dr.
Pierces Favorite Prescription and de-
cided to try it. I bought two \
and took the medicine according to th>Â»
directions. When baby was born he.

lime, and I have not suffered one

and healthy as can be. We thank you
for such a great medicine. I do not
think I can say enoutrh in praise of Dr.
Pierces medicines. May God bless I
and may you live long to minister unto

A NERVOUSNESS IN
WHEAT IS PREDICTED
FARMERS ARE MASTERS OF
THE SITUATION.
Bankers Are Disposed to Encourage
Storing in Anticipation of More
Favorable Conditions.
Wheat speculation has been daily look

ing: the )>RFt week a flutter of expectancy
appeared, but the flame was only mo
mentary. July advanced to SO, as com
pared with 71, the low point. At the ad
vance Armour's brokers supplied the
scared shorts. After their wants were
supplied the market dropped back into a
iuict and uninteresting 1 condition. As the
:lose of July approaches the more nerv
jusness will appear.
The very small stocks of contract wheat
n Chicago elevators make manipulation
. r ery easy. There continues a strong
?ash demajid. Interior mllWs are pay
r.g more for new wheat than buyers for
shipment can afford to. While the winter
vheat crop now being harvested is much
arger than that Of last year, yet farmers'
leliveries are a great deal lens during

tvork to retard a free movement to
narket. Farmers are to a certain extent
â nasters of the situation. Bfoney is easier.
Bankers are disposed to encourage the
â toring of wheat by producers in antici
pation of more favorable conditions later !
jn for selling.
Tha general conditions over the world
Indicate a surplus of about 150,000,000
t>ushÂ«ls of wheat over requirements upon
- a favorable conditions. It
would be only reasonable to expect this
small surplus to find room in the ex
low supplies the world acknowl-
For instance, the visible BOpply
of the United States is less than lO.OOOjOOO
bushels of old and new wheat at the pres
ent time. Never in the history of the
trade were stocks fo low. The same may
be said of all Europe.
Thf great crops now argued as raised
ar<- far from being realized. England and
America have thirty days yet of trying
er. England's conditions are grow
ing worse daily. Russia and Roumania
are acknowledging new damage. As re
gards the Argentine nothing can be said
of their crop, as seeding is only about
starting. Heavy rains throughout Prus
sia and Austria have done material
damage, the potato crop suffering
most. The Hungarian estimate has
been largely reduced. Many reports
rious damage come from the
Danube. Harvesting will be late in Eng
land, Holland and Belgium. Late re
ports from Odessa say extreme heat has
caused considerable damage. Wheat on
ocean passage haw shown a marked fall-
Ing off, showing stocks in all wheat ex
porting countries exhausted or nearly so.
Considerable complaint has been report
ed from Washington during the past
week, especially from the Palouse coun
try. Many predictions are made that the
\\ ashlngton crops will be 20 per cent less
than estimated figures given by the (Jnv
ernment Agricultural Department. The
same authority gives the California crops
at G50.000 tons, which Is altogether too
high.
In summing the situation up: As condi
tions now appear there is very little rea
son to anticipate any lower price* while
values may not appreciate for awhile
to any great extent from the fact that
buyers will hold off. hoping to secure
bargains. When it becomes evident that
holders of wheat will not sell, then sup
ply and demand will exert its influence
and a higher rang* will be brought about.
There are enough war clouds in the at
mosphere to dispel the idea of extreme
low prices this year.
The most active market at present is
corn. Dry weather, coupled with late
planting and a decreased acreage, has
Started speculation with thnt corral

Barley continues dull: speculation of a

The present holders of December barley
appear to be waiting to find a hard spot
to unload on. The consumption of feed
barley has materially decreased of late.

"STRAIGHT" POPULISTS UP IN ARMS.
Denounce Democratic Fusion Manipulators, Claim the Party Name
and Call on Friends to Organize in Support of the
Straight Populist Ticket.
TO THE POPULISTS OF CALIFORNIA:
The undersigned, appointed a committee by tho straight People's party conven
tion at Sacramento on the 14th of July, IS.IS, to prepare an address, respectfully sub
mit the following facts for your consideration:
Immediately after the failure of the attempted fusion of 1596, and on November IS.
1597. leading members of the State executive committee, and of the party, met at
Sacramento and prepared an address charging the Democratic party with having de
feated their candidate for President, and calling upon all who hoped for genuine re
form to unite in the People's party, and pointing out the utter failure of fusion of
ISS6.
Again upon October 28, 1897, the State executive committee met. with both our
Congressmen present, and unanimously adopted an address against fusion. Inviting
all who desired reform to unite In the People's party. This address was widely pub
lished In the press under the heading "No More Fusion."
At a later date the State committee, when It fixed a day for our State convention,
unanimously declared that no union would be considered unless other parties called
their S-tate convention for the same time and place and first adopted a union Popu
list platform for all candidates to accept before any nomination.
The Democratic managers then began manipulation In ninny places to control the
delegates to the People's narty convention, and notoriously In San Francisco, where
the Democratic machine was In evidence, at the county convention, and where an at
tempt to vote another man's name In the convention was openly made and detected.
In the midst of such methods, and long after mldnig-ht, twenty-nine delegates
were elected there by a single vote over their opponents, and twenty-elx of the San
Francisco delegation, containing at least two persons holding office under Democratic
appointments, sat in the State convention and voted against the unanimous instruc
tion specifically glvrn by the convention which elected them "to vote. for a complete
straight Populist ticket, and against any proposal to leave any places vacant."
Not one of these delegates would have been selected if they had announced they
would violate this instruction. Upon the roll call for Governor the vote for Musuirp,
ppmocrnt, stood 154, and for Shunahan, straight Populist, 135. The whole of said
twenty-six votes from San Francisco, so voting against their Instructions, voted for
the Democrat, whereas ten of these votes, If cast for a straight Populist, would have
nominated him.
In addition to the above offense other office-holders sat In the convention, and
candidates already nominated upon fusion tickets in their counties, and many who are
looking for fusion nominations in their counties. Surrounding all this was the active
effort of the Democratic managers to destroy tln> People's party. A painful feature
was to observe several members of the State executive committee who had voted for
anti-fusion resolutions engage in a determined effort to fuse the party, contrary to
such resolutions.
The straight Populists could not, until a roll call upon the nominees for Governor,,
know whether a mujurity would abandon their trust or not. Immediately upon such
a vote the minority, treating: the nomination of a straight i- mocrat und open mem
ber of the Democratic party and the expr<-Hs purpose Of the fuslonista to divide the
tlcktt with other p3rtl?s as an abandonment of the People's puny by suoh fusionists.
Withdrew from what they considered no longer the People's party convention and or
ganized and nominated a straight-out People's party ticket in the name of the party,
and as trustees of the party In Its name repudiated those who had betrayed It; also
created a new State Central Committee, giving power to organize n<".v county com
mittees In any county where a present County Committee shall adhere to the illegal
fusion.
Later on the fusion convention adopte.l a. report of a fusion committee agreeing
to accept the Lieutenant Governor, Controller, Superintendent of Public Instruction,
a Railroad Commissioner and member of the lioard of Equall7atlon as the portion of
the ticket to be allotted to the Populist.", and giving the Clerk of the Supreme Court
and the Suprvme Judge to Silver Republican*, and allotting the rest of the ticket to
the Democratic purty, agreeing to put up dummy candidates for the places allotted
to the Democrats, who were to tender their resignations, and providing for fusion
committees to carry out this scheme. The fusion convention also seated members of
other parties who had not been elected as delegates and allowed them to place In
nomination before the convention members of other parties as candidates, who then
and there received the nomination of said fusion convention.
Spare does not admit of giving all the reasons why Populists should not fuse
with IVmnorats. It is sufficient to say that It is illogical, inconsist-nt and wholly
destructive to our party. In addition we have the fact that the I>>rnnrrntic party
In i;p nil the agreements It made with the Populists nationally In 1596. and after
ward, when It had the power in legislatures, !t refuser] to repeal the specific con
tract acts In several S-t.itos. and It Is historically a party Of broken political prom
ises. That party is broken to pieces because of an attempt to put the mildest re
form In It. and Is reuniting under the manipulation and control of the plutocratic ele
ment within it, determined to cast out what It calls the heresies of 1896. It cannot
as organized become a genuine reform force. Not a single vital demand of the Peo
ple's party will come through It, or In any other manner, than by sturdy adherence
to our principles through our own or a third party until success comes. When fu
slonlstÃ speak of success they can mean nothing except that they may succeed In get
ting some offices and the emoluments thereof. The People's party was not born for
such .'i purpose and cannot survive by such methods. Fusion simply places the
party In the hands of Democratic political opponents, and they gain complete con
tr<-i of the fusion organization. If Democratic candidates are elected In this man
ner It is but so much more power hostile to a furthc-r existence of the People's party,
and will be us<Â»d to make a fusion Populist State convention In 1900, a mere Demo
cratic annex, for the purpose of selecting pretended Populists to attend a national
convention to Indorse straight Democrats for President and Vice-President. Thus the
wh"i" question of the life or death of the People's party la now Involved. James
<i. Magulre is a Democrat. An open member of that party. He does not claim to
be a meml>er of the Populist party. He voted to strike the Income tax out of the
Wilson tariff Mil in Congress and argurd against It. He will not claim that he favors
an amendment to the Federal constitution providing for an Income tax. He Is well
known to favor a single tax on land, to the exclusion of all other taxes, and to thus
be fundamentally opposed to an Income tax. He voted and spoke against the bill
to restrict immigration. He has said, both In and out of Congress, that he Is op
posed to the operation of railroads by the Government. He Is well known to hold
that the tariff Is still a supreme Issue aud must so remain until free trade Is
adopted, â  carolnal doctrine of all single taxers. Hi- voted to prevent Tom Watson
from g'.-ttlng his seat in Congress* He Is a member of the Democratic club called
the Croker Club of New York city, wnich club is organized for the purpose of de
feating Urynn and free stiver at 16 to 1 In lt<oo.
Mr. Shanahon was the only Populist elected straight to the Assembly in 1836. He
hns been ten yenrs in the legl.ilatlve balls and cvf- strong; with the common people.
He has come through this and out of It a poor man, respected for his ability and hon
esty. He ted the contest for the Australian ballot law, and also introduced and
Passed the railroad reassessment bill, which gained about J4.000.000 to the State; also
a Ptatp Income tax bill, yet pending, and Is the author of the law passed at the
last session extending the time for the redemption of mortgages, and of many ether
excellent laws. AS to the railway refunding bills Mr. Sh.'innhan Is entitled to as
much credit fnr his work against them as any man In the State. He has repeatedly
led the contest for resolutions In the Legislature against refunding, which resolutions,
when ient to Washington, were more potent than the voice of any single Congress
man.
The Democratic managers ore also now active to Introduce Into the campaign ques
tion* growing out of the war with Spain, making issues against Hawaiian or other
unnexutlon or territory, which questions are designed to side-track the economic and
financial Issues of the People's party platform, and also to furnish a cover for the
I>em<KTatl<- party to abandon the Chicago platform in 1900. Thus this fusion now es
pecially distracts and destroys the growth of Populist principles.
The Democratic managers have attempted the final destruction of the People's
party, but If Its members will be active to prevent It this attempt will fall. We have
no doubt we are entitled to the name of the People's party, and that fuslonlats can
not UM the name of a party whose trust they have thus abandoned. We call upon
all true Populists to actively organize and to form new county and other commit
tees wherever the old committee is so far In the hands of the Democrats as to ad
here to this fusion, and with active organization to support the straight Populist
ticket and preserve the immortal principles of the People's party, which were born
to live and not to die.

He was a foreman of the street cleaning de-

of Ripans Tabules, said: "I used to have lots
of trouble with my heart, caused, my doctor
said, from an imperfect digestion. Amongst other
remedies I used Ripans Tabules, and they are the
finest thing I ever tried. They ' knocked out ' the
Indigestion, and relieved the trouble in my heart,
whatever it was. Since I began to use them, my
bowels are regular, and I feel ten per cent better.
I can't recommend them too highly."

"HEALING" In the name of Jesus 'and preach-

cis Warnon, assisted by Rev. A. Coplin (State ;
offWr of the "Christian" Alliance), Rev. J.
Virtue, etc., every evening at 7: Sabbaths at
2 and 6 p. m. Last Sabbath 9S persons had
hands laid on them cessfully; a large audi-
ence witnessed and praised "Jesus only" for
marvelous instantaneous healings of paraly-
sis, total blindness (saw at 7u feot). total ;
deafness ihf-ard at 70 feet), tumors, etc. To-
day more testimonials of great "permanent"
healings (in 1534) by Los Angeles patients, of
cancers, tumors, blindness, eczema, etc.. and
the wonderful upraising of another alleged
"dying" person. Published reports of our
meetings last week were mere "burlesques,"
utterly devoid of truth. The good work grows
daily, and our God lays bare his holy arm in
saving and healing. Come and Judge for
"yourselves." Mr. Warnon looks to God
alone for all expenses of the work, and has
never, directly or Indirectly, asked financial
help of man and God honors his faith with |
abounding success. Revs. Warnon. Coplin, I
etc.. will Ehortly hold meetings and
establish branches all over the coast. Send
for our magazine, "Healing WingÃ." Bring
up your s'.ck.

PROF. OMAR, THE occult wonder.
ALWAYS SEE THE BEST.
325â âEDDY ST. 325 â 
SEPARATE parlors for ladies and gentlemen.
Private residence. All business sacredly con-
fidential. Gives full names or" every caller.
Name of your sweetheart or husband.
The True Herald of Merit is Deeds. The
Fecret of Prof. Omar's unbounded success is
that he advertises nothing but what he can
do.
He will not consent to have his ability
measured by any other standard than his
own. for there are always partially developed
mediums and cheap pretenders found in every
city, bringing disrepute upon the profession.
It goes without paying that Prof. Omar Is
the peer of all mediums.
He must not be classed with card readers,
fortune tellers and similar humbugs.
NO EQUAL.
He gives advice on business, speculation,
investments, insurance, love, courtship, mar-
riage and divorce, settles lovers' quarrels, re-
unites the separated and causes a spt-edy and
happy marriage with the one of your Choice;
locates mines. Interprets dreams, tells ot your
friends and enemies, removes evil Influences,
gives advice pertaining to lawsuits, etc.
There Is no home so dreary and sad, no life
bo wrecked or blighted, no heart so sad and
lonely, no condition of circumstances so com-
plicated or incomprehensible that can not be
tet right and kept ri^ht after a visit to this
Inspired prophet of modern times. Call and
be convinced of his superior power. Is your
husband or wife untrue? Has the demon rum
assailed the happy quietude of your home?
Does another share the love and attention
that should belong to you? If so, come and
learn a swift and sure remedy that will dis-
pel the dark clouds and lift the load from
your aching heart. Those that are unsuccess-
ful are made prosperous and started on the
road to wealth. If you have been deceived
by the false predictions of others do not de-
spair, but call and be convinced of the
above statement.
Hours: 9 a. m. to S p. m. Satisfaction
guaranteed. All business sacred and confi-
dential. Maid in attendance.
Professor Omar is the only medium in this
city who has appeared before the London
Psychic Research Society, as well as Boston
and Detroit branches of same, and indorsed
by all three. Tentlmonials and Diplomas are
on file In his office.

LANDLORDS are disappearing. ~ ~
Out n the Heyman tract they have forgotten
that landlords ever existed; there are no rent-
ers there; every family in that prosperous
neighborhood owns Its own home; the old plan
of renting benefited the landlord only; the new
plan, of buying your home on monthly install-
mer.i3, the lame amount that you used to pay
,-in rents, benefits you directly, for each pay-
ment brings you nearer to the time w!. I you
will have lo pay no more; two new houses,
modern, cozy affairs, juÂ«t being completed in
the' Heyman tract, can be purchased on these
terms; to-s?e them take Misaion-gt. cars, trans-
fer to E2d St., to Hoffman aye., and ask for Mr
.â¢<tir.es Cotter, resident agent, who will show
you around. JACOB HBYMAN, 11 Montgomery

MICHAEL BEATS LINTON
IN THE MATCH RACE
NEW YORK, July 23.â Jimmy Mi
chael met Tom Linton of Wales at the
Manhattan Beach cycle track to-day in
a twenty-five mile pac^d race, and
beat his opponent, in the presence of
more than 15,000 spectators. His de
feat on last Saturday through the
bursting of a tire was not looked upon
as a defeat by any means by the
midgetta friends, and to-day thousands
of dollars Wf-re bet and won on the
"rare-bit." Michael was the favorite
in the betting, odds of 100 to 80 being
freely laid on his chances. There was
plenty of Llnton money, however, and
in the history of cycling there has
never been such a large amount wa
gered on a contest.
There was very little wind ,and every
thing favored an excellent race. How
ever, no records were even equaled, as
both riders indulged in a good deal of
Jockeying in the early part of the race.
Some of the individual miles were cov
ered in excellent time, the ninth mile
being run in 1:38 4-5. In the last lap
Linton's men swung out and flew past
Michael, amid deafening cheers and
frenzied cries. Linton maintained his
advantage for nearly a mile until he
lost his pacemakers. Michael, who was
then riding like a little demon, passed
his opponent ar.d rode away from him.
This set-back evidently took the heart
out of Linton. and Michael fin
ally crossed the tape a winner by about
17Q yards.
The half-mile League of American
Wheelmen national championship for
professionals was won by C). L. Stevens
of Ottumwa, lowa. He beat Arthur
Gardiner by half a wheel in the final
heat. Eddie Bald whs six inches be
hind C,ardinor, and Tom Cooper, who
finished fourth, was only a few inches
back of the HufY.i !â > rider.
The two-mile professional handicap
was captured by (lardlner, who beat
Major Taylor by a length and a half
and established a new world's record
for the distance, under handicap condi
tions, as h<* covered the two miles in
4:l^ 4-6. Riser of Dayton Ohio, with
an allowance of twenty yards, finished
third and beat Bald out. th" other
scratch man, by half a length for third
honors.

which the latter won by 136 to 121.
Bannaty's bowling for the victors
was the feature, he capturing seven
wicketfl for 42 runs, bowling 3S overs
and having IS maidens. All the Cana
dians batted well, but only Davis and
Bed Low, both Chicago men, were able
to do anything for the losers. Davis
put together 41 in ripplnz* style, and
was caught out on a long drive to long
stop. Beddow batted very carefully for
28. and was caught out by Paile at
shortstop, in a most sensational one
handed grab of a blazing hot drive.
The fielding or the losing side was a
trifle weak, but the visitors did not let
a chance escape and allowed only one
bye.

THEIR PORTION.
Barge Club's Crew Captures the
Eight-Oared Shell by a Few
Feet After a Grand
Struggle.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, July 23.â The sec
ond and last day of the annual regatta
of ihr> National Association of Amateur
Oarsmen saw what was probably the
finest series of races ever seen at a na
tional regatta. In three events only a
few feet separated the first and second
crews. The most sensational race of
the day was the eight-oared shell,
j which the Pennsylvania Barge club's
champion eight captured from the
Argonauts of Toronto by a few feet af
i ter a grand struggle.
The weather whs perfect. Between
30,000 and 40.000 persons congregated
along the river to watch the races. Two
of the championships were captured by
Philadelphia crews. Ten Eyck won the
senior single championship, while the
Western Boating Club of St. Louis car
; ried off the honors of the intermediate
four-oared shell race. The Argonauts
â  > Wired the senior international four
oarod shell event, and Amos Kubik of
Springfield, Mass., won the inter
mediate single scull race. In the inter
mediate four-oared shell race the Za
wanaka crew of New York was ruled j
out for not correctly turning the three
quarter Hag.
There were three starters in the
intermediate four-oared race. St.
Louis Ipil at the start, with Zawanaka
second and the Argonauts third. The
difference between tlie first and last !
crews at the half-mile Mag was only
a length and a half. The Western men
rowed a much better race than they
did yesterday. At the turn they were
two strokes in front of the Zawanakas,
who failed to turn their stake properly, i
The Argonauts were two lengths be- i
hind. The race from th^ mile flag to
the finish was a grand one. The New
Yorkers caught the St. Louis men j
Bhortly after the turn and held them
to the finish. The result was in doubt
until the judges announced that th.-
Westerners had won by one second.
The Zawanakas were ruled out, how
ever, for their error at the turning
stake, and second place was given to
the Argonauts.
The eight-oared shell race was th^
i most sensational that was ever rowed
lon the national course. The crews that
i faced the starter were the Worcester
i High School of Worcester, Mass., Falr
! mounts of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Barge Club of Philadelphia arid Ar
gonauts of Toronto. Not one of these
eights had ever been defeated. From
the three-quarter flag to th<-' flm
point it was a magnificent struggle be
tween the Philadelphia^ champions
and the Argonauts. By a gr?md spurt
Pennsylvania managed to cross the
line first, five feet in front of the Cana
dians. The time, 7:40;, , is thr> lv-st
ever made over this course under sim
ilar conditions. Worcester was three
lengths behind the Canadians.

He Bunkoed a Small Boy Out of a
Part of His Weekly Wage.
The police are on the trail of the mean
est man in town, and should they llnd
him he will be treated with little cere

of 16, who works in a printing esiaollau

part of his salary, which he was carrying
home to his mother.
Young Brown told Captain Spillane that
he was walking up Market street, and
when near O'FarTefi a stranger asked to
be directed to a messenger office. Seeing
a chance to earn an extra quarter he vol
unteered to deliver the message. The
stranger then asked Mm where he worked
and was told that he vas earning $3 50 a
week. He was told by the stranger that
he was sending to another boy whom he
was going to employ to drive a horse and
buggy at $6 50 a week. After interesting
the boy with a hope of more remunera

Meany and Harold Griffon, living .it 236
Minna street, were seated in a doorway
on Third street, counting their earnings,
when a sympathetic passer-by dropped an
envelope containing a $5 gold piece into
their laps.
The boys entered a saloon and changed
the coin, and as they emerged, Jingling
the lately acquired wealth, their joy
was dampened by a man named B. H.
Roberts, who said that he was nn agent
of the Tesla Coal Company and who wit
nessed the transaction, demanding and
obtaining the money from the boys.
They told their story to Policemen
Tyn 11 and Tracy, and Roberts was found,
but he declined to give up the money
until threatened with arrest. Captain
Spillane now has the money, and if not

HER BABY EXHUMED.
Coroner Baldwin Will Find Out Eow
Much Truth There Is in a
Bitter Family Quarrel.
OAKLAND, July 23.â The body of the
infant child of Mrs. Henry Hoover was
received from Livermore by the Coroner
ifternoon. The child was horn three
months ago and died a month ago. Two
weeka after its death the young mother,
who is a wayward girl of lt>. married
young Hoover, much against the wish of
her father. John . '.rnett of PLeaaanton.
Barnett made publii a statement about
his daughter and she retaliated yester
day that he had given It some medicine a
couple of hours before death, and she now
says she believes it was poison. The child
â was burled on the side or the hill. by Miss
Barnett's father.
There has been trouble between the
father and daughter for some time, jnd a
year ago he says he attempted to correct
her and advise her, but she told him to
mind his own business.
"After 1 knew that she was to give
birth to a child," Says Barnett, "I tri -d
to make her tell who the father was, but
she only gave me the same answer, f
told her if she did not inform me within
haif an hour that I would drive her ftom )
the place. She alterward blamed it or. a
certain party and we had him arrested,
but he was innocent, and she afterward
said she did not know who it was.
"Three times, I believe, she tried to
poison me with strychnine found m l.rt
tles that had been thrown out tn the road
by a neighbor. I tasted it Â«n nay -ea,
which was as bitter .' s gall, and 1 i.hrew
it out and tasted the children's tea, and
It was all right. She denied it to me. but
she afterward told one of my boyÂ« that
she had put something in my cougn
medicine, Dut guessed it could not have
been strong enough."
Mrs. Hoover has signed the following
statement:
Mv baby died June 27. It was sick but a few
hours. It was a healthy baby and had never
ailed - much. Just before It WM taken sick
my father gave it something like medicine.
It began frothing- at the mouth. I wanted to
ko for the doel but my father would not
let me. When the baby died he seemed pleased.
He would not let me go near it or touch it.
He JÂ«8 a hole In the ground near the hills
and burled the baby tn it like a dog.
On one other occasion when the baby was
a little fretful he threatened to take it by
the logs and dash its brains out against a
fruit tree in front of the house.
The neighbors declare that Barnett is
somewhat eccentric and his daughter
wayward, and do not place much cre
dence in the stories, which are a part of
a bitter family squabble.
TO REMOVE POWDLB WORKS.
Residents of Melrose, Fruitvale and
Locicwood Take Action.
Oakland OfHcc San Fruncisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 23.
The residents of Fruitvale, Melrose
and Lockwood held a meeting to
night, at which they expressed them
selves very forcibly regarding the pro
posed rebuilding of the fuse works In
their midst and the maintenance of a
powder magazine there. The general sen
timent against the management for what
they termed "the deliberate act of one
of its employes" in permitting a magazine
to be left open was severe, and the Board
of Supervisors are to be appealed to to
Btop a repetition of such a Bcene. After
preambles the following resolutions were
adopted:
Resolved by the residents of Fruitvale. Mel
rose and Lockwood, in mass-meeting assem
bled, that the powder and fuse factory of said
Western Fuse and Exploilve Company, pro
posed to be erected at Hiijh street; Melrose. to
replaco the buildings destroyed will be danger
ous to the public safety, detrimental to every
property interest,, by rendering the neighbor
hood undesirable as a place of residence and
reducing the value of Its taxable property; that
we proteÃt earnestly against the re-crectlon of
said powder works.
It is further resolved. That the Board of Su
pervisors of Alameda County will take every
possible legÃl means to have said factories re
moved and that it will make and enforce such
rules and regulations governing the location
and operation of all powder, fuse and explo
sive works within the limits of this township
and county as will be for the best interests of
the residents thereof, and that such action be
â peedy and immediate as necessary to abate
and end thj> present danger.
E.H. MAKWEDEL,,. President.
W. W. JUDSON, Secretary.
. A petition embracing the features of the
above was drawn up and signed by all
present and will be at the real estate of
fice of P. H. Blake on East Fourteenth
street, between Fruitvale and Bray ave
nues, all day Sunday, where all interested
may call and sign it. This refers the
board to section 368 of the Penal. Code,
which gives them power to enact laws
for public safety and governing powder
works and asks them so to act. It will
be presented to the board Monday morn

E. D. HoughamSpeaksof
Republican Hari-Kari.
REFERS TO RECENT HISTORY
NO ENEMY OF MANHOOD CAN
EVER BE GOVERNOR.
The Well - Known Labor Orator j
Threatens to Stump the State j
as He Did Years '
Ago.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
90S Broadway, July 23.
H. D. Hougham, the well known labor ;
orator, hr.s prepared a statement wiach
he will use under certain circumstances
during- the coming campaign.
Mr. Hougham is recognized as the fore- i
most labor leader of California. Twenty
five years ago, in conjunction with James
H. Barry, A. S. Barlow, Patrick Reddy'
and William M. Hinton, Mr. Hougham
took charge of the California anti-Chinese
Association, and these gentlemen were j
elected as its State executive committee.
Ever since then Mr. Hougham has been
Identified with the labor interests of Cali
fornia. In 1886, when grand master of the
Knights of Labor, he was the poet of the
day at the great picnic held in San Jose,
at which Judge Maguire was the orator, j
Last year he was sent for to New York to
assist in the Henry George campaign, and
â was engaged in that work when Mr.
George died.
Mr. Hougham is the man who many
years ago first called attention to the cir
cumstances attending the transfer of the
water front to Carpentier and his asso
ciates at the expense of the city of Oak
land. With Judge Glascock. Colonel Jack
Hayes, James de Fremery and others of
this city he was inted a committee to
hire attorneys and prosecute the suits
which were brought twenty years ago.
Commenting on his work in the interest
of the water front some years ago the
Enquirer paid Mr. Hougham some
marked compliments. Mr. Hough^m was
at that time the owner of the Hougham
tract near the water front, and ue it was
wh" presented to the city of Oakland
fieeds to the first four streets, including
Twenty-second and Twenty-fourth, that
were opened to the water t'rur.t.
Mr. Hougham declares that this is nat
uraily a Republican year and that if the
Republicans put up the proper candidate
for Governor there would be no difficulty
in electing him. He declares, however,
that If any man who has shown himself
to be possessed of inhuman ideas and au
tocratic bearing toward honest working
men, whether employed or temporarily
unemployed. he will go to work again as
he did twenty-live years ago and organize
â¢labor against such a candidate.
"I will stump the State from one end to
the other before such Â« man shall be
elected by any party." said Mr. Hougham
to-day, "and this is what 1 will do it
with." Mr. Hougham referred to the fol
lowing document, which he has recently
prepared:
# The only part that I will take in this *
4fr campaign is to fight any oandidate "f *
# any party that Is known to he an entmy *
# of the laboring classes, and that is the *
â H- reason why I, together with many of *
*â¢ nr co-workers in the laborers' cause in * |
7C this State mil! oppose the- election of â¦ I
Â«* any such man as George C. Pardee for #
*â¢ Governor. If there is no other way to #

ORGANIZER FOR TEMPERANCE
MISS ADA L ADOLPHUS MURCUTT, the Eloauent Aus
tralian Preacher, Now in This Citu.
AMONG the notable visitors in this city is Miss Ada LÂ» Adolphus Mur
cutt, the young and popular Australian organizer of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union. Being delicate as a child, Miss Murcutt
was for some uti'tl by tutors at home, but afterward went
to one of the leading college'fe In Melbourne and took honors in English
at the Melbourne University In IS9O. In May. 1892, she went to live in West
ern Australia, hoping that the change of climate would prove beneficial to
her hfalth. There she became interested in temperance work and for six
months labored successfully among the Coolsurdie gold mines. Early in
1894 she visited South Australia and from there went to the Triennial W. C.
T. U. Convention hi Sydney and was appointed Australasian organizer.
Miss Murcutt's gift of speech and very pleasing manner win people'n hearts
and, In addition to her powerful Gospel temperance lectures, she often
preaches In pulpits on Sundays, and likewise has lectures on Australia with
limelight views.
This evening she will occupy the pulpit of the Westminster Presbyte
rian Church, corner of Page anu Webster streets.
Midwinter Fair that had been exten
sively advertised in the East. When
they got here they found that a very
large army of hungry and destitute men
of this State had filled all the places at
the fair, and many a hungry son cf a
California mother went without work
and many a hungry mother of a Califor
nia euif went without bread. , The sons
of Eastern American mothers â¢ without
money to pay their fare back East saw
the grim specter of want and Btar
vation starinn them in the face. Then it
was that the good and generous people
of San Francisco commenced to raise
money by subscription to feed these
hungry men, who were all American
citizens. After the noble people of San
Francisco had collected thousands of
dollars to feed them, Mayor EUert told
them that they had better try and work
their way back to their Eastern homes.
He promised to pay their fares across
the bay, and told them he thought the
people of Oakland would pay their
fares to Sacramento, and that they
could work their way from town to
town, until they reached their Eastern
homes. He took them to the ferry land
ing, paid their fares, Bhook hands with:
them, and said "God bless you, boys,
I hope you will get safe back to your
families."
But what kind of a reception did they
get from Mayor Pardee, this Oakland
Czar, the autocrat of the four hundred?
After kindly Inclined people had (riven
them the use of the tabernacle and as
sisted them with food, Czar Pardee, with
his cane across his back, walked up and
down outside the tabernacle com
manding his brigade and order
ing: the fire companies to con
nect their hose to drown them out
like. rats. He was determined to drive
them down to the railroad depot, where
they could be herded und driven into
hojr and cattle cars and sent out of
town like criminals.
During this scene Dr. Pardee used
language regarding that crowd which I
shall not repeat. When they sent for
Sheriff McKillican, he came to the tab
ernacle and said, "This Is inhuman;
this Is brutal; take those engines away
or I will do nothing to help you. These
men are human beings and American
citizens and have committed no crime
but the crime of being poor."
What right had this Oakland Pasha
to attack with . fire hose at midnight
unarmed, hungTy, defenseless men on
private property that had been hired
for their use by the donations of the
generous people of this city? They had
a rlsht to stay here as long as they
pleased, provided they broke no
laws. I have known Pardee ever since
he was a curly-haired boy on the streets
of Oakland, and I never knew that he
had ever sunk a Spanish fleet or cap
tured any kind of a Morro castle, and
I would like to know why he should put
himself forward as a dictator, either of
a party or independently. I call to
mind a few years ago when three
or ur thousand people of Oakland
were begging him to let the Davie
ferryboats land at the foot of Broad
way, Vardee said no at that time, and
maybe before the primary comes off he
will tell the people of Oakland why he
played into the hands ot the Southern
Pacific. Dr. Pardee Is an oculist: I
have no doubt a good one. In that
crowd that he drove like cattle from the
tabernacle and was prepared to drench
with a firehose were watchmakers,
piano builders, carpenters and the
like, ar.l of all the tens of thousands
of laboring men whom I have during my
lifetime addressed, I have not yet met
one who could see that an oculist is
any better specimen of a man than a
pianomaker or a carpenter.
If the Republican party of California
wants to commit hara-kiri there are
now right here in Oakland hundreds of
men who can assure It that there is an
instrument available for just such a
purpose. That operation can be per
formed most completely by allowing
such a man as pr. Fanlee to head Its
ticket, and I am sure that Judge Ma
guire would "like nothing better, as it
v. uM be the easiest thing to kick out of
his way on his Journey to Bacramento.
Let me pay in conclusion that if the
bolters and kicker? should succeed in
foisting Pardee on the Republican
party there will be a shout of indigna
tion go up from the throat of labor In
this State, irrespective of party, that
will be heard from Castle Crag to the
mountains of Fan Diego, and will raise
a dust in every hamlet in California
equal to thnt raised in Melr last
Tuesday by the mad act of a Chinaman.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 24, 1898.
SWATTED THE
OAKLAND BOYS
Good Politicians Make
Poor Ball-Players.
MANAGER EWING'S CAUCUS
DECIDED THAT VOTE - MAKING
WAS OUT OF ORDER.
One of the Hosts Almost Persuaded
Will Church to Break
a Most Solemn
Pledge.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 23.
Pleasanton was gay this afternoon. The
Red Cross ladles were out in force to wel
come the Married Men of Ruby Hill and
the County Officials, who arrived at noon
to play baseball for the benefit of the
society's funds.
The occasion was very auspicious and
very opportune. There was less difficulty
in getting together a good county team
than there would be if the November
election were three months past instead
of three months away. Manager Cal
Ewing knows considerable about base
ball. He knew enough a year ago to aid
materially in breaking up a league that
was not run entirely in the interest of
pure sport. The team he took to Pleas
anton was a strong one. It consisted of
J. P. Cook, a Deputy County Clerk;
John F. Somers, courthouse engineer;
"Will Church, a Supervisor; C. Schweer,
a deputy; A. G. Harms, a deputy; Frank
Jordan, County Clerk; J. Bardellini, Dep
uty Recorder; and John Mitchell, a Su
pervisor. This team is a very formidable
one to go up against the Married Men of
Ruby Hill, where much of Alameda's
famed red wine is made and where it
is said that the air is so pure and healthy |
that to breath it is to add ten years to
anybody's life.
As the County Officials were going to
Pleasanton on the train a little caucus |
was held, at which it was mutually agreed i
that no one was to do any politics while
at Pleasanton. Everybody deprecated the \
idea that the mere fact that one or two
candidates for office were going to play i
baseball for noble charity should be i
turned into a vote-making expedition.
This was solemnly ratified and all the
members of Cal Ewing's team kept their
word.
On their arrival at Pleasanton the la
dies of the Red Cross met the players
and guided them to luncheon tent. J.
Crellin, the manager of the Ruby Hills.
wondered what had come to town. In
cidentally he said to Will Church: "Well,
how are politics in Oakland." Mr. Church
assumed a vacant look something similar
to that which he puts on when his broth
er Supervisor Roeth makes an explana
tion before the board that needs explain-
ing.
"Politics?" said Church, utusingly. "I
â¢wonder if I can find a dictionary in Pleas
anton? I don't know what politics
means." And as he spoke he looked at
Frank Jordan with one eye and at Cal
Kwing with the other, and they both
winked.
The Married Men did beautifully. They
played good ball and earned as much ap
plause from the crowd aa the men-out-of
politics that went up from Oakland. The
team consisted of J. Hello, H. Madison,
E. Harms, J. Richards, J. Heggerty, F.
McDougal, Charles Graham, Dr. w. A.
H^rrisher and Professor WÂ« Donohue.
Unfortunately the County Officials could
not carry out their sworn pledge that no
politics should be done In connection with
charity. The ladies of the Red Croats and
the spectators were so well pleased with
the attendance and the quality of the
playing that they just swarmed around
the Oakland buys and promised them that
if woman suffrage were a fapt in A!a
meda County every lady in Murray Town
ship would vote for them.
As they cannot do this they promis.d
that their brothers and sweethearts and
fathers should do so.
Some of the Populist candidates for the
county offices started a malicious story
this afternoon around the Courthouse.
They said that the boys had gone to
Pleasanton for no other purpose than to
do politics. They sustained their argu
ment by saying that if the Oakland team
lost they would lose for the purpose of
making "friends of the winners, and if
they won it would be an argument that
such capable, alert fellows would make
the best kind of county officers. This
Kiean Btory was denounced as utterly un
true by Mrs. -Hattle McDonald, the mat
ron of the Receiving Hospital, who was
one of the very few county officials to
be found around the buildings this after
noon.
The game was very evenly contested
and resulted in a victory for the Married
Men by a score of 25 to 23.
BERKELEY LOSES HER
PET TRACK CAPTAIN
DRUM TO BE A BEAL LIVE
SOLDIER.
The Crack Sprinter of the State Uni
versity Has Forsaken
Athletics.
BERKELEY, July 23.â William Drum,
the star athlete of the University of Cali
fornia, has enlisted. Next Monday morn
ing he goes to the Presidio to take the
oath for service under Uncle Sam, and
with him goes Berkeley's track captain
for next year and one of the best track
men that the university ever had. In
stead of entering the lists against Stan
ford, with every opportunity for equaling
two or three intercollegiate records, he
will be content to serve as a private in
the Engineer Corps, Company L, Second
Regiment, United States Volunteers.
Much surprise as well as disappoint
ment is felt among university men over
Drum's intention to forsake the field of
athletics, and doubtless if college were in
session every effort possible would be
made to try to dissuade him from his
course.
Drum's career as a sprinter has been
in every way a brilliant one. His fame
w:is established during his first year at
college, when he took the 100-yard dash
out of the hands of Brunton of Stanford
In the intercollegiate field day of '97. The
time was 10 1-5 seconds, and although he
fell short of that by one-fifth of a second
last field day, it was generally conceded
that with two years' more experience he
would have been with hardly a peer in
any college in the country. In the 220
yard dash his record stood at 23 seconds
flat, and for the quarter mile 51 seconds
flat. In both these latter events he gave
as much promise as in the shorter dis
tance _,
Late this evening Drum expressed his
intention of returning to college as soon
as his term of service was over, but
doubted very much whether he would be
able to resume athletics. He said he felt
perfectly confident that his absence
would make no material difference in the
next field day against Stanford, as the
university could rely upon Dixon, Wool
sey and Broughton to carry off points in
the field events.
No License Reduction.
ALAMEDA, July 23.â Last night was
the time sot by the City Trustees to hear
applications for liquor licenses, and it
was expected that the request preferred
by the saljon men some time ago for a
reduction of 50 per cent In the license
tax would also be discussed; but when
the applications of the twenty-one saloon
keepers were presented not a word was
said by any one about a reduction and
the licenses will be fssued as usual at the
old rate. It is altogether likely that this
question will be a prominent one at the
municipal election next spring. There
are two Trustees who have expressed
themselves in favor of a reduction, and if
another can be elected next spring that
will settle the matter.
COUNCIL TO
TAKE ACTION
Lake Merritt Will Be
Greatly Improved.
CEMETERY CREEK PLANS
FIRST MOVE TOWARD MANY
NEEDED REFORMS.
The Offer of the Railroad May B
Accepted and a Park Be
Filled In on a
Marsh.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July !!â¢'{.
Although Cemetery Creek and cerfain
portions of Lake Merrltt have been ac
knowledged public nuisances for over
twenty years, no energetic effort has been
made to abate them and to provide a
remedy until the formation of the Lake
Merritt Saaiitary Improvement Club a
week ago. The matter will receive at
tention at the hands of the Council next
Monday night.
It has always been the crowning Rhame
of Oakland that the beautiful body of
water right In the center of the city
should be a nuisance and a menace to
health instead of a handsome pleasure
ground. Thi3 idea has been expressed
thousands of times on platforms and in
print, but it has never gone farther. No
one or no body of citizens has decided to
take the necessary steps to produce per
manent relief. With the development of
the country to i he north and east of the
lake, the necessity is now so great that
it cannot longer be ignored, and the im
provement club has taken the initiative.
One of the objections always brought
up when the matter has been discussed
previously has been that It was a local
matter and should be confined so far as
payment fur it is concerned to the prop
erty-owners who would be immediately
benefited. As these property-owners
consider that the benefits would bo
shared by the whole city as well as by
themselves, they have contended that the
dredging; of the lake and the building of
a storm sewer down Cemetery Creek
should be paid for by direct taxation of the
whole city. Unless the present plans are
changed, "the improvements will oe paid
for by a tax up>m the entire city; a tem
porary sewer will be built along Valdea
street from Twenty-fourth to Twenty
second, while Lake Merritt is being
dredged; the lake will be dredged to a
uniform depth of four feet below mean
high tide; a street will be opened and
Bewer constructed along Cemetery Creek,
and the east Hide sewer will be projected
into the deep water of the lake. These are
the plans upon which the property
owners and the Councilmen have mu
tually agreed, and which there is every
prospect will be carried out.
In this connection attention has also
!)â¢ â  ;i called t<> the fact that this would
be a. K'Â»od time to acquire the plat cf
water-front property on the west side of
this lake between Eighth and Twelfth
streets, which was offered by the Water
Front Company recentiy to the city for
This tract consists of several acres,
and with the dredging from the lake could
without expense be converted into a ftno
level park in the same manner as the
West Oakland Park is now being de
veloped.
THE ALICE STREET
BRIDGE TO BE SAVED
URGENT APPEAL MADE BY BUS
INESS INTERESTS.
Unless Action Is Taken at Once All
Teaming Must Be Done Over
the Park. Street Bridge.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, July 23.
The following circular waa Issued tn
day and is being sent out to all llrms in
this city:
There is a strong effort being made by inter
ested parties to cause the permanent removal
of Webster street bridge and the construction
of a new one at a point about 2,000 feet oast
of Webster street or above the Adams wharf
property. Pending the construction of the new
bridge. It is proposed that all travel between
the cities of Oakland and A^iameda be by way
of Park street, .which is reached from Oakland
by way of Twenty-third avenue.
You can see that much of the traffic will be
compelled to make a detour of about seven
miles to reach that portion of Alameda known
as the West End. and all the West End people
will be compelled to reach Oakland by making
the same detour by way of Park street. The
Southern Pacific Railroad has very kindly and
generously offered the people, through the
Board of Supervisors, the free and uncondi
tional u?e of the Alice street bridge, during the
period required to construct the new bridge at
whichever point selected. We understand that
the county will, in all probabllltj', construct
the necessary roadway on the Alice street
bridge, provided that the cities of Alameda and
Oakland construct the approaches thereto.
It Is possible that the expense (about $1,400,
of which Alameda's portion will be $1,200 or
more) cannot be all borne by them, and that
public subscription must make up the dl tl
clency or have no â¢ bridge for at least hlx
months, other than Park street. This work
will, in all probability, continue through the
winter, and all teaming will be much more ex
pensive than In the dry season.
Are you willing to subscribe something to a
fund to Insure the construction of the thor
oughfare? If so, leave your name and address,
together with the amount you are willing to
subscribe, with James P. Taylor, 455 Ninth

An average of 500 teams per day cross the

An appeal is hereby made to you and to all
Interested to attend the meeting of the City
Council, Monday evening. July 25, 1898, at 8
o'clock.
The Board of Supervisors has requested the
City Council to consent to the temporary re
moval of Webster Ptreet bridge to Alice street
BJid also to construct the approach thereto.
As the War Department requires that the re
movnl of the Alice street brkiue he commenced
by August 1, 1898, It is evident that Immediate
action should be taken so that permission be
obtained from the War Department for the
temporary retention of this bridge during the
construction of the new bridge.
The Supervisors claim they cannot legally act
until the City Council authorizes them to do
so.
The cities of Oakland and Alameda will suf
fer great Inconvenience, and in some instances
heavy loss to business firms will result, should
the Alice street bridge be not utilized. It means
all must travel by Park street and Twenty
third avenue. All interested should wrie up
to the seriousness of the situation and do
something to maintain an open thoroughfare at
or near the present bridge.

CHARLES R. ALLEN,
DECLINES AN EASTERN CALL.
Dr. Coyle Will Remain on the Coast
for the Present.
OAKLAND, July 23.-Rev. R. F. Coyle,
D.D., pastor of the First Presbyterian
church, returned this morning from a
flying trip to New York, where he spent
last Sunday in investigating a call ten
dered him by the Madison-avenue Pres
byterian church. He was only in the
city two days, but jn that time he de
cided that he did not want to become the
pastor of the congregation which gave
him such a unanimous and hearty call.
"The church," said Dr. Coyle to-day,
"is called a people's church, and that fea
ture of it would render the work very
agreeable to me. Hut there are other
things not so agreeable. The building is
not attractive; it is a large stone struc
ture, and the auditorium is somewhat
gloomy and somber. The church is going
through a transitional period, and the
outcome is somewhat doubtful. I do not
care to go into details at present, but
later on I will make a fuller statement
with regard to it. I will not accept the
call."

REPUBLICAN STATE CONVENTION TO
MEET IN SACRAMENTO ON AUGUST 23
State Central Committee
Issues a Call and Adopts
Plans for Electing
Delegates.
Boss Rea Scathingly Denounced
for His Brazen Attempt to
Control the Santa Clara
Contingent.
"Jim" Rea, for years the Republican
boss and bully of â¢ mta Clara County,
known throughout the State as a politi
cal trickster of the worst possib! de-
Beription; has received his quietus at
the hands of the reputable members of
hi* party.
I):irinjj the opening meeting of Ihe
Republican State Central Committee
terday, Rea was cathingly de
nounced by Chairman Frank McLaugh-
Iln and other members of the commit
tee, and to all intents and purposes
driven forth from the ranks of the
purty he has disgraced for so many
years.
The scheme by which h â  had hoped
to fasten h'.s clutch on the party in
Santa Clara County was defeated by a
unanimou vote, and the people will be
given their first opportunity in years to
express their views at an honest prim
ary and to rid themselves of Rea and
his reprehensible methods.

CURED BY
CUTICURA
About eight years ago I got sore hands. It
commenced with a burning sensation on my
fingers. When I rubbed them you could ccc
little .bite pimples on the skin, and I felt
like twisting my fingers out of their sockets.
I had high fever and cold chills, and nights
I had to walk tho J'oor until I fell asleep. I
got the Cuticcra Resolvent and Cdticuha
Soap. The nails hardened up and peeled oir,
and I don't believe there is one of the first
nails left on my hands which are now cured.

bling with passion thundered forth such
nunciatlon erf R--a and his methods
as was probably never before heard In
a party council.
Wh'ii McLaughnn declared he would
devote the remainder of his life, if
necessary) to ridding the Republican
party of bossism and boss rule the
members fairly howled their approval,
but though the cheering was terrific,
the major never ceased his denuncia
tion. lit> was too terribly in earnest
to pay heed to the applause his words
illed forth.
Through it all Rea sat grinning im
pudently, and at the close attempted
t" challenge McLaughlin's remarks by
asking If they were directed at him.
But when the chairman, looking him
straight In the eye, replied, "You ought
to know, Mr. Rea, you have had i I
i a boss," the mast' r â if
. Clara politics hung his head, and
from That time until adjournment hud
nothing more t>> say.
Of course, his job was defeated, and
most of the committee had left
the hall Rea went among a few who
would listen to him. telling- them that
his only object was to avoid so many
primaries^ for under his motion only
i have been necessary in
Santa Clara County, while now three
would nave to be held.
Aside from the turning down of
3 were marked by the
â  nthusiasm and harmony. The
resolutions tendered
Major McLaughlin at the opening of
the session, amended to Include the
"th>-r officers of the committee, were
adopted with loud cheers. Every men
tion of President McKinley's name was
ed with applause, and when
Chairman McLaughlin spoke of the
sweeping Republican
victory next November his hearers in
dorsed the prediction with shout
approval.
Th< *' Chairman McLaughlin
was more than temporary In effect. It
took hold of his listeners I r ad
journment it was the one topic for dis
cussion. There was a feeling that the
major was entitled above all others to
such honor as the party he had served
well could bestow, i'.ut
while he appreciated this feeling
was absolute in his declination I
Lge it. Many people high In party
s called upon him u> congratulate
him upon his denunciation of boss rule,
and to say to him that If he would but
consent I the nomination for
rnor his support from the party
would be unanimous and enthusiastic
and his i lection certain.
"Gentlemen." said the major, and he
hail to reiterate the sentiment to
others, "I esteem my friends, I have
t,i my party my time and my
efforts, but I cannot accept any
however honorable As much as
I love my party, as long as I have
worked for it. as dear as its Buccesa is
to me, I would set- it defeated before I
would waver in this determination."
To all the urging of his associates he
turned a deaf ear. His resolution was
fixed and final. "If any of you know
a %vay in which I can express myself
more forcibly," he said, "I am ready to
accept the amendment."
But realizing what his devotion had
been, th" worth of his services, the
high value he set upon the success of
the party, they could think of no
amendment. So far as office is con
cerned Major McLaughlin placed him
self beyond all consideration. There
were many expressions of rgret, but
no question as to the gentleman's sin
cerity. With preferment within easy
reach he thrust it aside. He refused
reward freely tendered, and made plain
the fact that his loyalty to the party
had In it no selfish purpose. The party
is welcome to his counsel, Bure of his
support. For the filling' of its offices It
will have to look elsewhere. The posi
tion of the major is regarded* as almost
unique In polities.
It was 1:46 o'clock when the com
mltteemen took their seats in Golden
Gate Hall and Maior McLaughlin called
the meeting to order. A call of the roll
showed that there were but few ab
sentees, and the majority of those who
were unable to attend were represented
by proxies.
"Gentlemen of the committee," said
the chairman, "I congratulate, you and
tip Repul.licfin party on the interest
shown in party affairs by the large at
tendance. I thank you on< and ;ill for
the wipe find able support and counsel
from thÂ» executive officers during the
last campaign. By united action, Cali
fornia was again placed in the Republi
can line and assisted in giving us Presi
dent McKlnley. The party is to-day
in splendid working order, and there is
no doubt that in "the next campaign
we will win another great and sweep
ing: victory."
At this point Frank Coombs of Napa
arose ond introduced the following
resolutions, thanking- Major McLaugh
lin for his able administration of the
affairs of office:
Resolved, That the thanks of the Re
publlcan party of the State of California
are due, and that they are hereby given,
through its representatives in committee
moled, to Major Frank MrLaughlin,
for the able administration of the affairs
of his office aa chairman of the State Cen
tral Committee; fur his efforts In the last
campaign, bringing victory out of appa
rent defeat, and tor holding the party
together from that time to the present,
thereby keeping the Republican organi
zation intact, and insuring a united effort
for the future.
Among the many able and distinguished
gentlemen who, during the past forty
. have led the party of freedom and
progress in the various political cam
jns In this State as chairman of this
committee, it Is do disparagement to any
to say thai Maim- McLaughJln is the peer
Of any of his long and brilliant ||
predecessors in the extent and value of

erclse of all these amiable chare

of this committee, but he has personally
endeared himself to its members.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUXDAY, JTTLY 24, 1808.
CALL FOR REPUBLICAN
STATE CONVENTION.
THE Republican St<ite Ceutral Committee of California, having
met to call the party electors to 01 activity for the
coining campaign, takes this Opportunity to declare devotion
to the political principles outlined nnd advocated by the LaÂ«t
national convention of the party in the platform adopted at St..
Louis two years ago. At the same time we would express to our great
leader, the honored chief executive of Â»lu< nation, William BfcXlnley,
our heartfelt congratulations for the profound wisdom and
terly statecraft with which lie hns guided the affairs of our coun
try during the momentous period of hi* administration.
Under Republican principles and a Republican President the
United States are already reaping the b^npiits of returning pros
perity, the honor and integrity of the nation are fully vindicated,
and we are once more a thortmghly united people. Wp heartily
indorse the acts of the administration, including tin conduct of
the war with Spain, the acquisition of Hawaii and the general
management of the affairs of the country.
It is apparent to all that new and great problems of govern
ment will arise as a result of the war forced upon our country In
the cause of humanity. Questions of vast consequence, affecting
the control and management of acquired territory and our rela
tions with the other great nations of the earth, will soon require
solution. The American people may confidently look to the Repub
lican party and President McKinley so to solve those questions as
will result in the highest welfare of our own country.
California should be especially loyal to the Republican party
â the party of enterprise, progress and equal rights. Our State
government, both of our Senators and all our members of the
House of Representatives, should be in political harmony with the
national administration.
In issuing the call for the next State convention we appeal to
the good sense and patriotism of the people of this great State to
exhibit such wisdom and activity in the coming campaign, includ
ing the holding or preliminary caucuses, voting at primary elec
tions, attendance on conventions and the management of the cam
paign to the closing of the polls on election day, as will certainly
give this desired result:
1. A State convention of the Republican party of the State of
California is hereby called to meet in the city of Sacramento on
the 23d day of August, 1898, at the hour cf 1 o'clock p. m., to

election to be held in the State of California, on the Bth day of No
vember, 1898. to select a new State Central Committee, and to
transact such other business as may be brought before said con
vention.
2. The apportionment of delegates to said convention shall
be: One delegate at large from each county and one delegate for
each 200 votes cast for D. E. McKinlay, who received the highest

3. Delegates chosen to said convention shall also be dele
gates to the district convention in the respective districts from
which they were selected, for the nomination of Railroad Commis

The last State convention upon May 5, 1896, resolved as fol

lican party should be elected at primaries, or caucuses, iegularly

State Central Committee before noon of the day fixed for the meet

Those only shall be allowed to vote at the primaries and par
ticipate in the caucuses whose names are upon the register of vot
ers or who present a certificate of registration from the proper of
fice, and who, under challenge, make oath or affirmation as follows:
"I will vote at the ensuing general election for the nominees
of the Republican party"; provided that in the city and county of
San Francisco the register of voters in use at the last election shall

The resolutions were adopted amid
gxeal applause.
The following resolutions, extending
jrmpathy of the State Committee
to the family of the lat<=> Cornelius
O'Connor, were next introduced by
Paris Kilburn and unanimously
adopted :
Whereas, Tt has pleased Providence to
remove from our midai Cornelius O'Con
nor, a membfl* of the executive rommit
tee of the Republican State Central Com
mittee, and for many years actively
identified In various capacities, not only
as ji eltisen, but as a member of the
Republican party; therefore, be It
Ived, That In the death of Corne
â¢'Connor the ctty and State In which
he lived for many years have lost a rood
and loyal citizen, the party a valued
member, .'111(1 this committee hereby ex
tends to his bereaved family their sln
â¢; in their present afflic
tion.
"The next order of business," said
the ' alrmaji, "will be the reading of
the call for a State convention adopted
by the executive committee. It was
proposed," he continued, "to expedite
matters. It was drafted simply for
your convenience, and it remains with
you to either indorse ur reject it."
Secretary Eliggins then read the call,
. after a few minor amendments
had been made, was adopted.
The apportionment " f delegates was
ti. m taken up. The call provided for
732 delegates, none of whom were to be
elected a( I
Then followed th>- liveliest !noidf>nt of
the meeting. Chairman McLaughlln
;m<l advancing, gavol in hand to
the front <>f the stage, gave utterance
to wrorda that painfully dinned in the
ears of Rea ana hlsh 1 s small clique.
"For the last two years
I have devoted my time and
energies, without hope or
desire of reward, to the
success of the Republican
party. I have devoted my
time da\ and night to that
cause with no desire for re
ward past, present or to
come except the success of
the Republican party. 1
now say to you that I will
not only devote the next
two years to the same
cause, but will devote the
remainder of my years â
even my lifeâ in opposition
to boss rule, corruption in
politics and domination of
corporations, It is my de
sire that we get close to
the hearts of the people,
and I hope and trust that
you will by your action
: here to-day evidence the
fact that the Republican
party is the party of the
people, and that I repre
sent its true sentiments in
my declaration against
I boss rule, corruption in |
j every form and the insidi=
I ous inroads o? the corpo
rations upon the rights of
the people.
"The knowledge that has
come to me through the
official position that I have
held and the close atten
tion I have given to the in
terests of the party during
the last two years has en
abled the executive com
mittee to so frame a call
for a convention that boss,
and gag rule shall have no
place in our councils, but
that the will of the people
shall be supreme."
tore Major MeLaughlin had con
cluded his remarks the commit teemen
wi re <t. their feet, wildly cheering and
tossing their hats in the air. Such a
mstration lias seldom before been
sen. It was fully live minutes b<
order could be restored. Some of the
committeemen cheered until their
throats gave out.
Rea realized that he had met his
Waterloo and that thÂ«* shackles of his
political bondage over Santa Clara
tty \\vre aliou; to he broken. He
â d to speak, but th< nmittee
men were Impatient, and by an almost
unanimous vote the amendment was
lost.
Cheering again followed the an
:ement, and Rea looked thunder
struck.
"1 accept this boss rule proposition,"
he exclaimed, wheTl he had somewhat
recovered from the shock to his sensi
tive i liti;';:! nerves.
"Very good, Mr. Rea," replied Chair
man MeLaughlin, in withering tones.
"You ought to be a very good judge of
it."
The comiattteemen laughed and
cheered again, and Rea took his seat.
Alter a moment's hesitation Rea de
termined to try a new tack. He con
tended the vote indorsing the recom
utive Jir.mittee
was given in support of his amend
ment. It was the clutching of a
drowning man at a nhantom straw.
There was a chorus of "No" from all
parts of the hall.
"If there is any doubt on the score of
the vote," said Flint of Los Angeles, "I
moye that the matter be reconsidered
and another vote taken after the ques
tion has been stated."
' ""I second that motion," said Thresher
of San Joaquin.
"There is not the least doubt con
cerning the vote and the wishes of
this committee." replied the chairman.
The recommendations of the executive
committee have been adopted. That
ends the matter."
Rea .saw that it was useless to at
tempt the bulldozing tactics so often
employed by him in Santa Clara
County, and, bitter as the pill was, he
Swallowed it.
"I am willing to withdraw my mo
tion," said he, "because I never was
opposed b> primaries."
"Of course you never were," inter
rupted a eommitteeman in the rear of
the hull in ironical tones.
"That's all right," resumed Rea, "I
want it understood that I was solely
actuated by a desire to advance the
interests of the Republican party in
Santa Clara County."
"Of course you were," shouted an
other of the committepmen.
Rea took his seat and vainly attempt
ed to smile, but it wasn't "the sa 4 ne
old smile" he usually gave when he
held the lash in his hand over conven
tions in Santa Clara County.

to avoid any confusion, a special pr>
vision be made allowing the use of the
canceled registers in San Francisco in
addition to allowing those who may
have become voters here since the reg
istration two years ago to vote on the
presentation of a certificate from the
Registrar.
A motion to that effect was made
and unanimously carried.
Another discussion arose as to
whether the delegates already elected
in several interior countit 1 would be
allowed to sit in the Congressional Dis
trict conventions.
Some of the delegates said that they
were in doubt on that score, as the call
provided for delegates to Congressional
District conventions. They had fol
lowed the old course of electing dele
gates to the State convention, these
delegates to meet also in district con
ventions for the nomination of Con
gressmen, members of the Board of
State Equalization and Railroad Com
missioners. Â"-â "
It was exolained that the call would
not interfere with the work of the
counties that had already elected dele
gates, and that it was not necessary
that a different set of delegates should
be elected to the Congressional conven
tions. The delegates who will here
after be elected to the State, the Board
of Equalization and the Railroad Com
mission convention may also be
elected to the Congressional conven
tions.
The call for the convention, as
amended, was then unanimously
adopted.
The following resolution, adopted by

On the arrival of the passenger ves

wharf to hoodwink .strangers and
brin^ them to these dens. Some 'of
the places would ostensibly, be inform
ation bureaus; others were conducted
as pack train offices; and others as cut

The office for the pack train service
was the most successful, as most
every one coming here has more or less
packing to do. Soopy's rates for work
were always a little better than those

he called "The Skaguay Militta." at

SKAGUAY, July 21.-The citizens'
committee has held daily sessions since
the killing of "Soapy" Smith, and up
to the time the Farallon left had suc
<â â¢: >1 in ridding Skaguay of nearly
ail of its objectionable characters A
number of suspects are still In charge
of the committee. United States Dep
uty Marshal Taylor has been charged
with neglect of duty and attempt
exto: t money, and is und-r . ;
t0 v - Grand Jury in
Sitka next November. Nine others
have also been committed and taken to
Sitka <m the steamer.
Captain V.- ;i tman of thÂ° United
States army, with a detachment of bol
diers, is in Skaguay and was contem
plating putting- the town under mili
tnry rule, fearing that summary pun
ishment would be administered, but
finally accepted the assurance of th*
committee that all persons In their
charge would be given an imp
hearing. The town still remains in the,
control of the citizens' committee.
After the burial of "Soapy" Smith
the committee took charge of his prem-
Ises and effecta and a search of the
former resulted In the finding of the
sack of dust stolen from Stewart. The
sack was found in a trunk in a build
ing at the rear of Smith's saloon. >,'.-;ir
ly all of the $2775 stolen was reoovered.
It was rumored that other evidenc :a
of foul play and robbery were found
but the o-nimittee will not make any
thing public until it has finished its
work.
When the FaraHon left everything
was quiet. Saloons were closed day
and night. The committee has been
petitioned by saloon keepers to reopen

that their houses would be kept in
first-class order, but their request has

AS to the antecedents of Soapy
Smith, upon whose grave tho
earth of Skaguay's cemetory is
yet fresh, little is generally
known, and that little is not Im
portant. He tirst reached fame while
operating in Denver, where he com
bined With rare skill the vocations of
thief, gambler and politician. From
fho last he derived the pull whereby he
was enabled safely to pursue the
oihers.
At one time he was a power in the
Colorado city, and no crime in which
he engaged could keep him in jail for
more than a few moments. He would
irrested at midnight for a serious
offens". and after an early breakfast
' be on the street as gay as a lark super
intending a primary with a view to
purifying municipal government^ chat
ting with policemen, his air being that
ension, or showing a visitor
from the country the lnutility of guess
ins: which walnut shell had a pea un
der it. Nothing: could embarrass him.
His quality of cheek Has never been
d, and this s Ity on oc
<â¢;,;â ;, . ri>urage. His
death at Skaguay was a fitting end, but
tardy, very tardy.
To be truthful it becomes necessary
to dispel one illusion concerning Smith.
He was not an educated man. On the
contrary, he was ignorant. Far from
being a master of French and Spanish,
he never mure than half conquered
plain English. He was a plausible
talker, as many learned by an exp r
)â¢â !:â  c which cost them all the coin they
had available when his dulcet tones
wooed them to his den, but his gram
mar was hardly up to the gambling
room average. However, had h*- pos
sessed a moral nature which would
have kept his talents from going a / r y
he might have been a leader of men,
for wherever he happened to be there
red about him ruffians and scoun
drels who looked upon him as master
and faithfully brought to him the
spoil of their raids on the unwary. For
these scurvy chaps he was always
ready to fight with pistols or to put up
bail. For in his peculiar way Soapy
war; always true to his friends. His
selection of friends was bad.
There is not a trick kuown to confi
dence men in which Boapy was not ex
pert. He had practiced them all. had
won thousands, and, unless? he acquired
new habits in Alaska, frittered it all
away. Hi;-, delight In spending money
was as great as his joy in stealing it
to expend. Not only was he generous,
but having won a large stake he in
variably made straight for a faro game
and, as he expressed it, blew it all in.
Sometimes he was lucky, and then he
would say gleefully: "Boys, I win a
thousand lafit night off old Bell. Have
a drink with mo." What was not ex
hausted in treating the crowd, in loans
to others who hadn't "win out," was
â¢ get in Ball's sooner or later.
In his earlier Denver days Soapy was
not Hush. When he did not have the
means to play bank he would buy a
bar <>f laundry Boap, borrow a "few
twenty dollar bills and proceed to re
coup. It was by this he got the name
which has out-lasted him. lit- would
cut the soap into minature squares,
wrap the pieces in tissue paper, and
standing on the street corner display
the lot In an open satchel held on a
tripod. The p.iblic would be invited to
purchase "Dental soap, the finest
preparation for the teeth ever com
pounded: good also to soften the skin,
polish the nails and warranted not to
harm a child." Three pieces of this in
valuable adjunct to the toilet could be

had for half a dollar. Soapy's keen
gray eyes would scan the throng for a
buyer.
At first there would be no response.
Then he would take from his pocket
one of the borrowed twenties, unwrap
a piece of the soap, enclose it in the
money, rewrap It and throw it Into the
satchel. Sometimes he would repeat
this several times, at last inviting the
spectators to pick out the pieces they
thought contained the bills. Of course
there was no difficulty in doing this.
Then cupidity would be aroused, and
at the point where buyers were tum
bling over each other to get to the
satchel, the trick came In.
It's an old trick, but nobody ever did
it ?n well as Soapy. The packages
which should have had the money
simply didn't have it. Nobody ever
captured a single piece of money, and
yet the crowd would not stop trying as
long as the soap lasted. By this time
Soapy would have enough to keep him
amused at faro for a night.
But this scheme seemed to him petty,
and as a rulf> he held himself above it.
He much preferred quicker returns. It
was more to his tnste to work a rus
tic for a purse of money. He started
a gambling rooms with r-very robbing
device known to the craft. The games
appeared as fair as .->thpr games, but
they were all crooked. Nobody had a
chance of winning, for cards wrc

stacked and the most ingenious de
vices used for skinning patrons. If any
visitor showed a disinclination to play
he was sold a gold mine which never
existed, induced to invent in fictitious
stock. As a last resort he was quietly
"touched" and thrown without unnec
essary violence into the street.
But one day Denver had a spasm of
virtue, and concluding that Boapy had
nourished too long began to insist that
the police drive him away.- He went to
a suburb, but the city extended so as
to embrace the suburb, and Soapy had
to look for other fields. He found one,
and is buried in it.
Once the Smith gang got hold of a
miner who had boasted of being able
to write an acceptable check for" $5000.
Gathering of the Vigilance Committee at SKagway on the Day Stewart Was Robbed
and "Soapy" StTjith Was Killed at the Head of His Gang.
From a Photograph Taken for The Sunday Call. '
They ascertained that the boast was
well founded, and they kept hold of the
miner. When they had him workably
drunk they accused him of lying, de
claring a disbelief In the allegation
that he had a cent on deposit. The
min^r becoming indignant offered to
bet that his word and his paper were
good. So a wager was made and
the stakes together with a cht/pk for
$5000 placed in the safe. The miner
kept on drinking until he had reached
the stage of being paralyzed, when he
was tucked in bed. The sun was high
in the heavens before he awoke, but
it had n^t been very high before
Soapy or some of his pals were at the
bank. The first check presented wag
the one for $5000 and it was promptly
cashed. When the miner awoke he was
indignant, but he gained nothing by
this beyond a compromise. Soapy and
the gancr divided the booty.
But this man soapy was known to
be generous. He would give money to
a beggar and delighted to shower it
upon friends. One time he met a news
paper man on thÂ« streets "f Denver.
The journalist in his pursuit of his
calling had frequent occasion to call
the confidence man a thief, but Soapy
viewed this in a strictly professional
light and nov<=>r manifested the-slight
est hard feeling.
"Hello, Dick." he r"mark>d. "Come
in and have a hat with me."
They happentd to have met in front
of a hat a.nd furnishing su.r^.
"Tou 'l<m't owe me any hats." Dick
responded, but Soapy insisted. The hat
was purchased, and then Smith re
marked that the reporter was wearing
a rather shabby overcoat. As before,
he was insistent, and Dick asked an ex
planation.
â¢'lts just this way," said Soa >y. "I
win out a couple of hundred selling
soap. It's in my clothes right now. I'm
on my way to Cliff Bell's u< play bank
and tryin" to spend It before I get there,
for that old son-of-a-gun will get every
cent I don't manage to drop between
here and his game."
Soapy's personality was not attrac
tive. He was hardly up to medium size,
dressed carelessly, spoke quietly. It
was only when there was a victim in
sight that he became interesting. He
had a keen but wandering eye. He
was continually on the lookout lest one
of his numerous dupes might be in
clined to take a shot at him. But ha
had all the honor of the gambler, a
strange quality hard to define. A thief
by instinct and training, his I O U
was good for its face. If he borrowed
$100, raying he would pay it at 11
o'clock next day, at the hour he would
be at the appointed spot with the
money, even if he had to rob somebody
to "btain it. In fact, from the time
Soapy reached the years of manhood
there fa no probability that he ever
earned honestly so much as a cent.
Pictures of Smith show that at the
time of his rleath h" wore a beard.
When thÂ»' star banko artist of Denver
he had only a mustache, and the face
revealed had every appearance of
frankness. This first impression was
heightened by the smoothness of his
tongue. Nobody ever accused Soapy
of being a coward. He had shot and
been shot at ir.any times before a bul
let reached the proper spot. He did not
hesitate to face heavy odds, and with
unriffled mem. he took a gambler's
chances. Anybody who had known
him could easily imagine him as riding
agrainst the throng gathered to rebuke
him and his kind, and if he knew the
shots he himself fired had touched the
mark, no doubt he felt a gleam of joy
just as he passed over.
Then he went to Alaska, and from
the moment of his arrival there his
record was one of crime and violence.
He even went so far as to organize his
chnsen thugs into a military company
and offer their services to the country.
The Government thanked him, but did
not accept, and the company stayed in
the far north to plunder until *he
leader was killed and the subordinates
scattered before the wrath of the popu
lace.
It will be long before the world shall
see another like Soapy, one so un
scrupulous, so brazen, so despicable, yet
brave and loyal to his "friends." H. j.18
Good Stories By L eading Actors
PESSIONAL comedians are seldom or never
funny in real life, yet all of them are actors in
scenes upon the real stage of existence that are
quite as funny as any in which they ever take
part upon the mimic stage of the theater. In
response to a request that they would relate the
funniest thing that has ever come under their observa
tion, some famous stage favorites furnish the follow
ing anecdotes:
About as funny a thing as I can recall in a theatri
cal way just at this moment is a story about Tom
Keene, the tragedian, which
EDWARD HARRIGAN. no one tells better or laughs
t at more merrily than himself.
It was many years ago, when he was leading man at
Is' Museum in New York, which was managed by
the late George Woods. Louis Msstayer was the co
median of the company at Woods' Museum at the time
of which I speak. Every theater had a permanently
located stock company at that time. Both Keene and
Mestayer suffered from an irresistible tendency to guy,
which in stage parlance means to do everything pos
sible to make one's self and everybody else on the
Btage laugh, especially in the most solemn scenes. As
the company at Woods' had to play at twelve per
formances a weekâ every afternoon and every night,
and not infrequently had three or four parts a week
to study, it will be readily understood that many of
the members were not always letter perfect by any
means, and often spoke more lines of their own com
position than those of the playwright. One Saturday
afternoon "Fanchon" was put up. Keene, of course,
played Landry, while Mestayer personated Didier.
"The Governor," as the members of the company all
called Woods, sat in one of the proscenium bo^es and
attentively watched the entire play. Neither Keene
nor Mestayer knew their parts, and I have heard
Keene Bay that they did not speak half a dozen of the
lines set down for them. The spirit of^jfuy seemed to
have taken complete possession of them.
The curtain had scarcely fallen when "The Gov
ernor," as was often his custom after a first perform
ance, came behind the scenes, evidently in a very bad
humor, and began pacing up and down the stage, his
brows heavily knitted, his mouth twisted up as only
he could twist a mouth, and his toes turned in in that
peculiar way by which all who knew him knew so well
when he was displeased. Both Keene and Mestayer
longed to ask him what he thought of the performance,
but each dreaded to do so, thinking it by no means
Improbable that he might discharge them for guying.
At last, mustering all his courage and resolution,
and shaking in his shoes lest "The Governor" should
pronounce upon him that terrible anathema, "Depart
from me, ye accursed," Keene approached him and
Bald: "Well, Governor, how did you like my Landry
and Mr. Mestayer's Didier?"
â  Elegant, sir, elegant! The best I ever saw," was
Woods' rejoinder. "I always thought them a couple
of sissies, and you played them that way."
I presume that most people who visit the theater
have heard the term "fly-by-night" applied to minor
and unstable theatrical com
panies, but I believe there are
very few, if any, v ho under-

stand the term, and even among the present generation
of actors there are very few who know how the term
originated. It was in the days when old Sol Smith had
a strolling company, which played in only the smallest
and Queerest <>f all the small and queer towns in the
South and West. Smith and his company were playing
a varied repertoire, as every company had to ao at tnaw
time, of which "Macbeth," with all of Locke's original;/
music, was a prominent feature, but the public proved/
unappreciative and times were hard. Soon Old Sol andL
his company were at low water mark, and at lengths
found themselves stranded in a little Kentucky town,
from which a flinty-hearted landlord refused to permit
them to remove their baggage until they had liquidated
his claim against them for board.
Smith felt that he was equal to the emergency, hav
ing "been there" often before, and he cast about in his
mind for some means of deliverance. At length he hit
on a plan. He engaged a countryman to bring a heavy
wagon, drawn by a team of sturdy horses, under the
window of his room at the back of the tavern at a cer
tain hour on a certain night. The members of the com
pany were let into the secret, and it was arranged
that on the night in question they should throw the
landlord off his guard by assembling in the parlor
and practicing one of the witches' choruses com
posed by Locke for "Macbeth," and entitled "We Fly
by Night," in which those words are repeated over and
over again. Meanwhile Old Sol and his most trusty
henchman were to lower the trunks from the window
to the countryman, who was waiting below to receive
them.
This programme was carried out to the letter. The
company were singing "We Fly by Night" for dear
life in the parlor, while Smith and his man Friday
were letting down the trunks with as much celerity
and quietness as possible, but alas! not, as they fondly
thought, into the hands of the countryman who was
to convey them to a place of safety, but into those of
the landlord, who had somehow got wind of the
scheme.
At length the work was completed. Old Sol and his
companions, with a great load lifted from their minds,
joined the company in the parlor and united with them
in singing "We Fly by Night."
But just as they had sung those words for the third
time, the door opened, the landlord entered, and their
horror was beyond expression when he said, "Excuse
me, ladies and gentlemen, bu' you will not fly by this
night, for I have possession of your trunks."
From that time to the present all queer dramatic
and musical companies have been known as "fly-by
nights."

to this country, was also stopping. Now the dean and
the actor who played the first old man with the Palmer
company were about the same age and bore a most
striking and remarkable resemblance to each other,
especially in point of size and the general outline of
their figure. It chanced one day that as Dean Stanley
was going upstairs the comedian of the Palmer com
pany was coming up behind him, and mistaking for
his old friend and associate, the first old man of the
Palmer company, he playfully gave the dean a sharp
thrust with his thumb in a very sensitive portion of
his anatomy, which happened at that moment to be
especially prominent.
Poor Dean Stanley, bellowing with rage and anger,
turned hastily around to see who had taken the liberty,
and beheld the comedian, who was overwhelmed with
mortification and regret to find that he had been so
familiar with one of the heads of the English church.
"O, sir," he exclaimed, "I beg your pardon. I really

The dean reversed the precedent of Hamlet's Fath

sorrow for a moment, and then said in his most digni

thereby making it necessary that one or two profes

One night, while playing in a Western city, I was
called to the stage door to see a man who had inquired
for me. "What can Ido for you?" I asked.
"Do you pass the profession?" said he.
"Certainly," I replied; "what company are you play

"The Mastodon Minstrels."
"What is the line of your business?"
"Hat-lroner."

turned to MOBB and said gleefully, "We have a splendid

The next morning when the colored waiter brought

Viewed in the light of the events it
may conceivably bring forth, this trio
of changes may be described without
exaggeration a; the event of the cen
tury. There is little to say about it
that has not already been said, but as
a subject for comment it has this ad
vantage, that there is little mystery
about it. One great element of uncer
tainty of course remains â the final di
rection taken by American public opin
ion, but with that exception one may
speak as a witness and not as a
prophet.
First, then, with regard to the fu
ture army and navy of the United
States. The war has taught this coun
try a severe lesson. A few weeks be
fore the outbreak of hostilities I read
in a leading New York paper a care
fully detailed estimate, based upon re
turns from every State in the Union,
showing that an army of 10,000,000 men
could be promptly raised. This ludi
crous notion undoubtedly corresponded
to the popular view of the country's
capabilities. Anybody who remembers
certain statements made during the
Venezuelan dispute will not think this
remark extravagant. It was known
that the patriotism of the people was
equal to the supply of any number of
volunteers, the resources "of the coun
try were known to be limitlessâ the
By Henry Norman, Commissioner of the London Chronicle-
combination of innumerable men with
limitless resources is all that is required
for a vast army. Such was the reason
ing. But nobody is misled by it to-day.
The President has called out 200,000
men, and they have responded with ex
traordinary promptitude. But in a few
days two months will have elapsed and
the whole force is yet far from ready
to take the field. Fifteen thousand
men â nearly all regulars â have gone
with General Shafter to Santiago; a
few thousand are to be sent to rein
force him as quickly as possible; about
7000 have gone to Manila; 20,000 are
wanted for Porto Rico and ai;e not
available, while the main army of Cu
ban invasion will hardly be ready, I
should suppose, for another month yet.
A month ago it was commonly said
that 75,000 men were going at once to
Cuba. The United States could not dis
patch half that number of equipped sol
diers then, although she had over 100,
000 men with the colors. The state
ment remains true a month later.
Remember one thing always: The
war took everybody by surprise. It
was not desired, it was not ex
pected; it was, therefore, not prepared
for. If the Maine had not been blown
up ihere would be peace to-day. Forty
eight hours before the rupture a lead
ing New York capitalist, who had gone
to Washington to discover the exact
situation, returned and reported that
he had absolutely certain knowledge,
from official sources, that there would
be no war. Thus the Government was
called upon to create and equip an
army from foundation to coping. The
regular army was small in number,
â¢red all over the country; it had
never been collected since .the rebel
lion; officers of different companies in
the same regiment were often stran
gers to one another; brigade drill, and
even regimental drill, was unheard of.
The National Guard, of which so much
was expected, had, in many cases,
neither clothing nor arms. A few were
"ready, aye ready," but the response of
most of them has been described as a
mixture of tragedy and opera bouffe.
\\ h.n 1 visited Camp Algcr I found
one regiment of 800 men with 200 rifles,
and several had from 30 to 40 per cent
of new recruits â men who had never
fired a rifle. Then, again, the War
Department had not the aid from the
States that it had confidently expected.
A hundred thousand men, q'aickly fol
lowed by nearly 75,000 more, were de
livered to it, needing almost cvery
thlng. They have been transported
vast distances with one â only one â tri
fling accident; two weeks hence, Gen
eral Alger has assured, me every man
will be equipped, down to two suits of
uniform for the tropics; the "hard
ships" they have suffered are not such
as a soldier should talk much about;
32,000 tons of rations have been provid
ed for them; fifty transports have been
chartered and fitted out; besides all
this, the War Department has laid 1500
submarine mines, set up forty search
lights, and armed a large number of
fortsâ often building them first. After
admitting every reasonable criticism,
it is a triumph of organization. I
doubt if so much, from so little, has
ever been accomplished so expeditious
ly and so uneventfully before.
And look at the display of American
patriotism. When the volunteers were

summoned by the President they walk
ed on the scene as if they bad been
waiting in the wings. They were sub
jected to a physical examination as
searching as that <-f a life insurance
company. A man was rejected for two
or three filled teeth. They came from
all ranks of life. Young lawyers, doc
tors, bankers, well-paid clerks are
marching by thousands in the ranks.
The first surgeon to be killed at Guan
tanamo left a New fork practice of
$10,000 a year to volunteer. As 1 was

station on his way to Tampa. It was
John Jacob Aator, th.- pdssesgor of a
hundred millions of dollars. Theodore
Roosevelt's Rough Riders contain a
number of the a- rtect young men in
New York society. A Harvard class
mate of mine, a rising young lawyer,
is working like a laborer at the Brook
lyn Navy Yard, not knowing when he
may be ordered to Cuba or Manila. He
is a Naval Reserve man and sent in
his application for any post "from the
stokehole upward." The same is true
of women. When I called to say good
by to Mrs. John Addison Porter, the
wife of the secretary to the President,
whose charming hospitality I had" en
joyed, she had gone to Tampa to ship
as a nurse on the Red Cross steamer
for the coast of Cuba. And all this, be
it remembered, is for a war in which
the country is not in the remotest dan
ger, and when the ultimate summons of
patriotism is unspoken. Finally, con
sider the reference to the war loan. A
New York syndicate offered to taffi; half
of it at a premium which would have
given the Government a clear profit of
$1,000,000. But the loan was wisely of
f> red to the people, and the small in
vestor gets all he can buy before the
capitalist is even permitted to invest.
And from Canada to the Gulf, from
Long Island to Seattle, the money of
the people is pouring In. As I write, it
â¢is said the loan will be all taken up in
small amounts.
It is true that soldiers in Florida
should not be fed on pork and beans,
and that campaigners in Cuba should
not wear thick cloth uniforms. But
while these truths may be remembered,
another should not be forgottenâ that
the American people have responded to
their country's call with instant and
flawless patriotism.
The lesson they have learned is that
patriotism alone will not fight battles.
How far will that lesson carry them?
Will it build up a great army and
navy? The question requires a two
fold answer. In the United States
there is a curious antipathy to a large
standing army. The masses of the
people dread such a centralisation of
power. Nothing excites more hostility
JhsLD the employment of Federal troops
to settle State difficultiesâ witness the
outcry when President Cleveland sent
regulars to quell labor disturbances in
Chicago. It is 'feared that a large
standing army might lead to aggressive
campaigns abroad, but a hundredfold
greater is the fear that it might be
come an instrument of oppression at
home. So strong is this sentiment
that the army will assuredly not be"
increased to any great extent. Hitherto
its strength has been nominally 25,000

Thrilling Adventures of Daring Prospectors, Who Tried to Reach
the Sold Fields on the Upper Sushetna River.
SUNRISE CITY, Cooks Inlet,
June 21, 1897.
THE tide of humanity which has
been pouring into Cooks Inlet
all summer long has finally
reached the flood and already
the current has turned, and day
by day grows broader and swif
ter. The first to set the tide home
ward bound are those who have come
with scant outfits and little or no plans
for practical work.
The great majority belong to this
class. Conditions are so vastly differ
ent from what they were pictured in
the newspaper reports that nine cases
in ten those who have come here find
that they improperly provided them
selves, either for living in the country
or for prospecting it. Even the most
carefully laid and well regulated plans
have fallen through, and company af
ter company have broken up, leaving
their dredging and hydraulic machin
ery lying on the beach or selling it for
next to nothing. The great majority
have come prepared to prospect
through the summer and return home
in the fall. But when they arrived
here and began to learn some facts
about the country from' the old timers,
they find that there are only three
months in the year during which suc
cessful prospecting can be done, and
and that is from October 1 until Jan
uary 1. In the early summer they must
wait about two months for the snow
to melt away. Then another two
months for that melted snow to run
out of the creeks so they can be trav
eled.
Even if they could get into the inte

high in the creeks to allow of prospect
HUGE MODEL
OF THE EARTH
THE celebrated French geographer.
Professor Elisee Reclus, is spe
cially coming over from Paris to
lay before the Royal Geograph
ical Society particulars of his
project for a gigantic model of the
earth.
Professor Reclus' idea is to construct
a globe on a scale of eight miles to
the inch, this being the smallest sized
Bphere Â«>n which it would be possible
to show, correct to scale, the depth of
every river and the height of every hill
on the earth's surface.
This exact replica of the world would
measure roughly eighty-four feet in
diameter, or half the size of the dome
of St. Paul's. This would mean a dis
tance of thirty feet between New York
and London, and Paris and London
w<mld be about three feet apart.
The scheme is not exactly a new one.
Professor Her-lus having h;u'. It in mind
for some years, and. as a matter of fact,
the Communale Council o! Paris had
promised a large sum of money toward
the construction of such a globe for
the Paris exhibition of 1900, but unfor
60,000â a tiny force for 70,000,000 people,
according to European standards. But
as a result of the war the local regi
ments will gain vastly in popularity.
and they will probably hv kept up to
full strength with capable men and
complete equipment. Moreover, there
are signs that the famous Seventh
Regiment of New York will not have
incurred its terrible unpopularity in
vain. In future every local regiment
will probably be allowed to go to the
front as a unit and will not be depend
ent for its separate existence upon the
whim of the Governor of its State.
Therefore, the American land forces
will be largely increased in reality,
though not nominally.
With the navy, however, the case is
different. It cannot be used by the
executive for oppression at home; the
need of it for defense is universally re
cognized; it has always been the popu
lar arm; it has covered itself with
glory during the war. The fear of an
aggressive policy, it is title, has influ
enced past naval estimate; ;ilso. It
has always been easy to get money for
coast defense ships, and difficult to
get it for sea-goiag battle-ships and
cruisers. But this will be loss the case
now that America has possessions over
sea. Xlready one significant fact has
shown what may be expected. Not
only was the last naval vote by far the
largest since the rebellion, but Con
gress positively made great additions
to the shipbuilding recommended by
the Naval Construction Committee â a
course without parallel in American
history. The official recommendation
was for one battle-ship and four tor
pedo-boats; what Congress authorized
on May 4 was three battle-ships, of
11,500 tons; four monitors, of 2700 tons,
for harbor defense: sixteen torpedo
boat destroyers, of 400 tons; twelve tor
pedo-boats, of 160 tons, and one gun
boat to replace the Michigan upon the
lakes, if an arrangement with Great
Britain permitting this is reached. The
bids for all these phips are to be opened
in August and September. I have
compiled the following table, compris
ing ships afloat, building and author
ized, including those purchased for this
war. one of these not yet launched at
Armstrong's, to show that a powerful
.American navy is already an accom
plished fact:

here, or ever has been done, according
to the old-time miners' report, except
from the time the ground freezes until
the snow is too deep to work through.
But of course no one who is busy
hurrying hither and thither to get
his outfit ready and his passage
secured on some boat that is just about
to leave, and after which there will be
no earthly chance to secure passage on
any boat â such a crojtvd of busy,
hopeful prospectors hajfe no time to
stop and think of a little bit of detail
like this. They know that the sum
mers up here are fine and long and
that the gold is here waiting to be
washed out, and all they want is a
chance to get on the ground and they
will lind means to prospect, etc.
But just the same, it is the failure
to keep a close account of these little
details that has misled so many. And
great is the suffering from loss and
disappointment. I know personally of
many cases of men who have mort
gaged their homes, sold nut lucrative
businesses or made other great sacri
fices in order to outfit themselves and
get here, only to turn back and sell
their outfits for enough money to get
home tm after less than a month's
stay in the inlet.
Some have even gone back home
without even getting off the boat they
came on.
Those returning home now are called
cowards, weak hearted, etc., but are
they cowards after all? What else
can they do? They have miscalculated
and ?r^ utterly unprepared for a stay
through the coming winter, and in or
der to stay for tho short prospecting

winter.
But some are showing lesa good
sense and are staying and trying to get

The primary object of Professor Re

SHOOTING DOWN THE BIG SUSHETNA RIVER.
This party spent twelve days hauling and poling their boat loaded with supplies up the Big Sushe tna
. River. Then the boat upset and they lost everything. The current bore them back to their starting
point in seven hours.
From a^ sketch of the men as they came in sight of the starting camp.
The Big Sushetna River is the center
of excitement now. It is a great
whirling torrent, ten miles across in
places and narrowing down to rushing
rapids at other places. It leads back
from the head of Cooks Inlet into the
mountains over toward the Copper
River country, going through swampy
valleys, winding , around rolling hills
and mountain peaks, splitting into
thousands of small tributaries and
larger streams, draining the immense
water shed to the north and northeast
of Cooks Inlet. Like the Yukon River,
the Shushetna is full of islands and
shifting sandbars. At this season of
the year it is swelled to its utmost and
the banks are continually caving in,
bringing great spruce, trees crashing
into its swift current. As this drift
goes down and passes through some
narrow channel between two islands it
jams and shifts the current to another
channel. By and by it will break
loose and go tumbling down the river,
carrying everything before it.
There seems to be an underground
current at places, for at times, where
the stream is flowing along compara
tively smooth, there will suddenly burst
up from the sandy bottom a roaring
spring that sets the water to boiling
and swirling like the Niagara River.
These are the odds to be met by those
who go up the river now.
The method of ascending is for two
men to walk along 'the beach or scram
ble along the precipitous and marshy
banks, as the case may be, towing a
small boat, while a third sits in the
boat and steers.
The farthest up any party has been
this summer is eighty miles. A party
of three with eighteen months' sup
plies had gained this distance after
twelve days' work from 8 in the morn
ing until 12 midnight. The hardships
and dangers they bore are indescriba

People may be inclined to think that
such a globe as described would be of
small practical utility. But, apart from
its many and important scientific uses,
it is computed that the thousands of

such an object would probably learn

When she had finished it, he said, quite

At the end of the twelve days a float

the boat, and their complete outfit, with
the exception of a sack of flour ami a
bag of smoking tobacco, went to the
bottom.
They had been working in their un
derclothes and were left without cloth
ing to wear.
They got in their boat and the swift
current took them back to the mouth
of the river in seven hours.
The general average of progress of
outfits up the river is about two or
three miles a day.
The steam schooner L. J. Perry,
which has been the "carry-all" for
three years from point to point, in the
inlet, is preparing for an attempt to
ascend the river. Her owner, Mr. La
throp, is one of the pioneers of Conks
Inlet, and thoroughly understands the
currents of the stream. By starting
up at flood tide he expects to make the
first run of twenty miles. Then he will
anchor or ground his vessel and wait
for advantageous winds. In this way
he expects to ascend a hundred and
fifty miles. If he succeeds he will
convey miners tip as far as possible,
which will be by far the quickest and
Cheapest way for them.
No discoveries of any note have been
made this season as yet. In fact, no
prospecting has been done. But there
will be several hundred who will get
up inland and put in the fall season
of prospecting and remain hermited

that many new discoveries will be re
ported from this work early next sum

Only four or five cases of drowning

privation and suffering, Louis
Malartre and Eugene Bassot
have just completed the jour
ney from San Diego, Califor
nia, to Paris, France. As
these men walked every step of the
way that lay over solid land, and trav
eled through the wildest and most in
hospitable sections' of Mexico, each
lay passing through some adventure,
their trip must be looked upon as one
of the most thrilling 1 recently under
taken. Add to this the fact that they
traveled entirely unarmed and without
a cent of money to start with and their
: mance becomes wonderful.
Both Malartre and Bassot are well
known alon,? the coast as they are sea
men and made coastwise trips for
many years. About five years ago they
were shipwrecked with the schooner
Queen of the Bay, on the coast of
Todos Santos Island, some 50 miles be
low San Diego.
After lying around town a few days
they departed, telling their friends
they were going to Paris, via Vera
Cruz. Since then nothing was heard of
the two Frenchmen ur.til a few days
ago when letters came to Martin Lavi
gne in San Diego, telling of tht-Ir safe
arrival in Paris and incidentally recit
ing a few of the adventures passed
through on the way and also enclosing
a number of clippings from newspapers
in the Mexican towns in which they
met with extraordinary adventures.
The California friends of the two ad
venturous Frenchmen had long since
given them up as dead and are conse
quently greatly rejoiced to hear of
their safe arrival in their native land.
But when their adventures are consid
ered it would seem as if they must
have borne charmed lives. It is hard
to believe that two men could pass
through such hardships without suc
cumbing.
According to th^ letters from Malar

Bassott traveled along the coast to

unload a lot of mining machinery, af

unconquered Yaquis, and then
we shall see!
"Making their way along the
railroad through Hermosillo
and Torres, the men arrived at
Ures. They bore marks of their
gfcrat privation, but were of the
same astonishing humor.
"Through pure admiration of
their wonderful pluck, and with
a strain of envy stirring up the
wanderer that sleeps in the
breast of every man, th^se
Frenchmen were furnished with
food and clothing gratis. They
accepted such articles as were
useful, but declined dainties and
heavy apparel. With all their
wild roving, they are shrewd,
these Frenchmen. Without hes
ir.tion they resumed their jour
ney. They said their route would
lead them through the Yaqul
strongholds, but they feared no
Indians, because they carried no
weapons and convinced the na
tives they were on no mischiev
ous errand.
"From the Yaqul, if they ever
get through, the men, will cross
the Sierra Madres, going
through places where white men
have never been. Making their
way into the State of Chihua

the City of Mexico and thence
to Vera Cruz. There they will

with the an-
nouncement that
such fruit would be
excluded if the presence
of San Jose scale were
proved.
Fallowing this decree of Austria-
Hungary the Government of the Neth
erlands sent to the United States one
of the most eminent scientific men in
Holland, Dr. J. Ritzema Bos, for the
purpose of investigating- the status of
thÂ» San Jose scale. Upon his report
will probably depend the passage of
a bill, now bofore the second chamber
61 the States General, prohibiting the
entrance of fruits and living plants
from America into the Netherlands.
About the same time an employe of
the Agricultural Department of Swe
den, Dr. Yngve Sjostedt, was also sent
to the United States, partly for the
purpose of investigating this rnuch
talked-about Insect. The same matter
hns been discussed in official circles in
other European countries, including
England; but no definite action has
been taken. All this foreign legisla
tion Is having and will continue to have
a distressing effect upon American ex-.
ports of fruits and living plants; but,
if our Government is as apt as usual,
we shall learn from this experience a
lospon of value.
It was necessary, of course, in order
to protect our internal Interests, â¢ that
a hue and cry should be issued from
the National Department of Agricul
ture and from the experiment stations
of the different ' States as soon as the
extreme danger of thp spread of the
insect In the Eastern States was real
ized; and it was necessary, also. ; that
fruit-growers should be constantly In
formed of the procresÃ of the pest, as
well as of the results of the experimen
tal remedial wo'k.whlch'^ap.hflticfar
rledon by our State and National Gov
ernments. Therefore, with all this
publicity, it was only a question of
time when forelsrn Governments ehon'd
take alarm, and at least begin â â  to ln-
lantique. Well, it is possible
they will succeed. At any rate,
no man can help feeling a thrill
of admiration for their aston
ishing spirit and love of adven- â 
ture. Buen viaje."
From this point Malartre takes up the
story of his wanderings with Basstrt
and by a simple recital weaves a tale
of absorbing interest. Gifted with a
happy facility of expression, and hav
ing some education, Malartre describes
well the manifold adventures they en
countered. He describes the unex
plored fastnesses of the Sierra Madres,
separating the States of Sonora and
Chihuahua, where evidences of gold
tempted the wanderers to stay their
feet.
They were seized by the Yaquis, and
but for their utter frankness and fear
lessness would have been put to death.
Between the lines of Malartre's letter
can be discerned the spirit of the Three
Musketeers â a devil-may-care, maraud
ing and not too conscientious spirit.
Tied hand and foot in a Yaqui camp,
the men laughed and Joked with their
captors and by their recklessness soft
ened the Indians into giving them food
and drink, and through the latter ele
ment the men made their escape. They
induced the Yaquis to fill themselves
with mescal, pretending all the time to
keep pace with them. When the In
dians were so drunk they could not
walk the two guileless Frenchmen took
a canteen each of the fiery stuff and
leisurely made their way down the
mountain slopes toward Paris. Once
out of sight of the Yaquis they made
haste till dawn the next day, going
into a densely choked canyon and hid
ing in a cave. The next day they
placed eight leagues between them
selves and the Indians.
And so on all the way down the line.
They fell from a precipice in the Du
rango Mountains and Bassot was laid
up for six weeks with a broken shoul
der. Malartre meantime hunted, trap
ped and cooked the food, besides 1 nurs
ing his companion and looking out for
marauding Indians.
The men worked in the Zacatecas
vestigate
the possi
bilities ofdan
ger to their own
fruit-growing in
dustries.
That Germany was
the first Government to
gain exact information on
the subjoct, and the first to
take action, was due to the fact
that for some years she had had
a scientific man of ability and
standing attached to her embassy
at Washington. This attache, sta
tioned there for the sole purpose of
studying: everything: relating to Ameri
can agriculture, was all along as well
posted in regard to the spread of the
San Jose scale as were our own <;â¢â %
ernment officials; and through his ef
forts Germany was able to issue the
decree at what seemed to be the proper
moment.
This would oDviousiy suggest to our
Government a similar policy; and it Is
interesting to note that as early as 1892
the Secretary of Agriculture strongly
urged in his annual report to the Pres
ident that representatives of the De
partment of Agriculture should be at
tached to our legations in the principal
countries with which we have agricul
tural relations. The present Secretary,
Mr. Wilson, has repeatedly advocated
such a course since the beginning of
the existing administration.

BLACK SAND MINING MADE TO PAY AT LAST ON THE PACIFIC COAST
WORKING A PAN OF BLACK SAND FOR COLOR.
From a Photograph.
BEACH sand gold mining has
been a hobby of mining enthusi
asts in California for a number
of years, but in the majority of
cases all endeavors in that d
tlon have resulted either disastrously
or at least unsatisfactorily.
The people of Humboldt County have
done their full share of this unpn
ble speculating, and not until within a
month have their efforts been.reward

ods of gold discovery in California, a
few weeks of rich strikes, coming aa rt-:

THE FAMOUS MONADNOCK GHOST AND WHAT IT DID FOR ITS FRIENDS.
THE double-turreted monitor
.Monadnock came down from
Mar- Island a few clays ago,
looking as grim and black as a
foundry as she took her place in
warship row off Folsom-street
wharf After remaining their a few
days she departed on her voyage to
Manila, and is now somewhere near*
Honolulu.
Considering that this was practically
her "coming out" amone her sisters of
our new navy, it is difficult to imagine
that she has had "a past ' Not a
scandal 1 . Oh, no; but a mystery! A
deep. dark, unfathomable mystery that
for years caused the tongues of more
than the mere gossipeâ¢ '" wa * and
furnished food for thought to the delv
ers into occult science. For the Monad
nock was haunted almost from her
birth.
It nrai away back in the "70's (she's
not such a young thing, after all), that
Messrs. Becor, VanderbUt and Burgess
came out from the East with a Govern
ment contract to repair the old and
original Monadnock. Be it known that
the navy then contained a double
turreted monitor of that nameâ a
monitor which had successfully made
the voyage from New York to Mare
Inland in 1868, convoyed by the steamer
Vanderbilt.
It was to repair this old monitor that
Secor et al. secured the first appropria
tion, for the average Congressman in
those days had no true appreciation of
the value of a navy, th<'ir motto In ef
fect being, "Millions for patches; not a
cent for new Bhil s."
Fortunately the representatives from
California, aided by their colleagues
from the Atlantic coast States, formu
lated a plan whereby they might suc
cussfully pull the wool over the eyes
of the fresh water statesmen from land
locked States; said plan providing for
the building of a new vessel under the
fiction that (in old one was being re
paired, California's distance from the
national capital affording excellent op
portunities for such a scheme.
Under the coaching of these Con
gressmen the contractors, on their ar
rival at Mare Island, it is said, visited
the old Monadnock at her anchorage in
Rotten Row, and taking a rivet hole
out of one of her side plates proceeded
to build a new vessel around it on the
stocks which they had erected on the
Vallejo shore, all progress on such work
>eing regularly reported to Washing
v?\n under the head of "repairs."
Vn the hands of a few score of me
chanics these "repairs" progressed with
more or less speed, with occasional in
termissions of a year or two each for
lack of Congressional appropriations,
and in time the ribs of iron and plates
of steel gave shape to the hull. It was
while the vessel was in this stage that
one of the contractors, who had taken
up his residence near by, was awak
ened from his slumbers one night by
a furious pounding at his front door.
He found the night watchman of the
shipyard, an old man named Narvey,
at the door, almost in a state of col
lapse. It required the administering
of a "cordial" to restore the frightened
watchman to his senses. He ex
plained that he had been driven from
his poet by a horrible ghost.
In vain the contractor strove to re

most sanguine with th>- typical gold
fever, and then day at least a

it was to frighten Narvey into resign

job with its accompanying salary of
$90 per month.

a portion of it back to sea. Until re

One r.ight, while comforted with this

watcher meditatively munched his meal
and listened to the mournful sobbing
of the waves as they washed around
the piling and under timbers of the
wharf. Apparently in unison with the
sobbing- of the waves came the wind in
fitful gusts, causing a dismal creak
ing of chains and pulley blocks on the
derrick spars, while the occasional .
slapping of a ratline aginst the sides
of the poles and staging, with occa
sional whistling through gaping holes
in the ship's side, added to the many
sounds of the sea, familiar to all old
sailors, furnished anything but food for '
pleasant thoughts.
It was while thus i surrounded that
Narvey was suddenly aroused from his
reverie by the sight of some black sig
nal wigwagging on the wharf almost
at his feet.
With a wild cry he dashed his dinner
bucket at the phantom shadow; and
then realizing that it was but the ie
flection of something overhead quickly
turned his gaze upward, only to be hor
ror-stricken by the sight of that Ter
rible Thing, leaning out over the ves
sel's bow and jeering at him.
With an effort he grasped his gun,
discharged both barrels, striking the
horrid object full and fair, for with a
thrill and quiver it rustled for .1 mo
ment, then hung limp and still across â¢
the ledge of iron.
Now Narvey was in scarce less de-
Bpair. Would'he be justified by the law
In slaying a fellow mortal? Was it ad
visable to throw the body overboard to
be carried off by the out-rushing tide ? .
No! He would awake the town, and

Resolved on this course he started
for the gate, but had scarce taken two

sound from above, and in a, second he
was doused from head to heels with a ;
bucketful of chilling cold water! A;â 
horrid, uncanny laugh of derision rang ,
out on the still air, and then the almost
paralyzed watchman saw the awf il
thing step lightly off the bow, glide ,.
easily through the air and disappear in
space over and beyond the roof. of the
main workshop.
The next day the story of this latest
visitation' was all over Vallejo and the
navy yard, but people only tapped their
foreheads significantly and looked pity-
Ingly at Narvay. . \ V >

large surface of the planet over

this similarity the locality on Mars has
named the 'Sand Sea" by astron
omers, but there is no telling for cer
tain what the true nature of the local
ity is.
The famous astronomer, Herr Karyll
of Vienna, has given years of study to
this phenomenon and looks upon it as
more important than the canals, be
cause he thinks it "more permanent."
Herr Karyall has just published a pa
per on this subject, which is attracting
attention all over the world. It is a
most learned document, that goes
deeply into details and explains many
points that have not appeared -.If-ar
before. Referring to the Sand Sea Herr
Karyll says:
Among the changes on the surface of
Mars, whether we refer to the very slow
periodic deformations of known points on
the planet's surface or the variations in
the so-called canals and seas, which have
bwn the cause in recent .times of so many
attempts at explanation, there Is one
appearance that is particularly worthy of
note. It Is the shifting of the east coast
of the "Sea of Sand" on the surface of
JJars. which also bears the name of the
"(ireat Syrtis." This eastern coast has
â hlfted more and more from year to year,
as Is shown in the diagram, as proved by
rvatlons of the greatest reliability
made since 1577 by the most emln< i as
tronomers, such as Schiaparelll in Milan,

In order to comprehend the mow'
ment and extent of this so-called Â£nd
deluge it is only neceÃsary to Imagine
the changes as taking place in our own
country. From our knowledge of Mars
this would be equivalent to a sand
storm starting at the Rocky Mountains
M and extending from Canada to
Mexico. Imagine that it covered thickly
all the western coast from Vancouver
iwer California and you will have
an Idea of what is supposed to have
; place on Mars between 1564 and
1896.
..though the opposition of the planet
Mars does not take place until Janu
ary is, 1599, astronomers the world over
are already making preparations to
rly observe the event. On this
occasion, when the sun, earth and Mars
are in a direct line, a great deal of the
nmst valuable information about our
nearest planetary neighbor is expected
to be obtained.
The Last opposition of Mars took place
In December, 1Â«!Â«6, on which occasion
science was enriched by a number of
tlif most valuable facts. Since then,
however, there has been great Improve
ment made in equipment for taking ob
servations.
The most noticeable of these is the
great Yerkes telescope at Chicago,
Which it Is confidently expected will be
mounted and ready for work before
that time. This telescope has already
been tested in a rough manner, and it
revealed more of the details of plane
tary Bpace than ever the eye of mortal
man had previously beheld. Work on
the big new observatory is being rushed
to completion, and when the telescope is
properly mounted in its own delicate
adjusting tower there Is no telling what
wondrous secrets of the starry heavens
will be laid bare. Hut the greatest ex-
Ltion is in connection with ti.>
planet Mars, for more is known about
this celestial body than any other, and
every bit of additional information is
of the greatest importance.
There are also a number of improve
ments in the other telescopes of the
different observatories all over the
world. A great deal is expected of them
by the men in charge, but even if they
Bhould be disappointed in the perform-
Of their instruments there is no
doubt that a great deal new is sure to
â  arned anyhow, for the old
scopes are as good as they ever wi re
and the surface of Mars is constantly
changing.-
It is this phenomenon of change that
makes Mars bo Interesting:. Ever since
a telescope strong enough to reveal the
details on the planet was built a con
titant cbangre of the surface has been
noted. At first, with poor Instruments,
these changes could only be s â¢â¢â r: as a.
sort of film, but since the greal tele
: of the world have been built they
have been revealed as having consid
erable character. The great tube at our
own Mount Hamilton has even made it

DIAGRAM SHOWING HOW THE "SEA OF SAND" IS SWEEPING OVER THE PLANET.
The famous astronomer Herr Karyll of Vienna, who has given years to the study of Mars, has ins! published an
important paper on the shifting "Sea of Sand.' The document throws light on a number of points. The d

few hours -if opposition is that at that
time it is nearer to the earth than at
any other and presents the merit in
teresting fui-,-.
Mars is In what is known to earthly
astronomers as the "outer" circle. That
is. its position Is farther away from the
sun than the earth's, and It revolves
in a circle b >yond <.ur own planet. As
there Is considerable difference between
the time It takes east of the two heav
enly bodies to travel once around the
kuii it must follow that for a certain
time they gel farther and farther apari
until the limit is reached, and then
gradually draw closer and closer to
geÂ£h< r until in opposition. At this
moment th>- whole visible surface, of
the planet Is flooded with th<- light
from the sun, so that it can be studied
through the telescope to the best" ad
vantage.-. The hours for observation
are best between midnight and dawn,
as then the planet is at its brightest
and occupies the best position.
The real "opposition" of the planet
lasts only an instant in reunty. But
a few hours before this opposition and
a few hours afterward arc always fa
vorable for study. It is then that all
the telescopes of the world are turned
on our neighbor: and for all we know
their telescopes may be turnea on us.
But if such an event, .or events, were
possible the astronomers of the two
spheres would be taking observations
of two distinctly opposite phenomena.
The astronomers of Mais would be ob-
Serving us as a "transit." while we
were observing them as an "opposi
tion." They would appear to us as a
world Hooded with light, whirling
through the blackness of stellar space.
To them OUr earth would appear as b
tiny black orb, traveling across the
brilliant disk of the sun. We could
watch, them for hours until they passed
"beneath" .our horizon. They could
see us for only a few moments. First
we would appear as a circle of light,
something like the new moon, then as
a black spot in front of the sun, and
again for a few moments as a circle
of light to afterward fade away into
darkness.
Whatever the earth astronomers
may know about Mars, it is most like
ly a good deal more than the Martian
astronomers know about the earth.
The reason for this is very simple.
When we are close to them we are In
darkness on account of having the
sun on the other side of us. When it
so happens, that we do appear to
them as flooded with light, we are on
the opposite Bides of the planetary
circlesâ nearly 250,000.000 miles a way

great advantage. Unless, indeed, the
Martians have telescopes so powerful
as to make ours as mere opera glasses
when compared with them.
This, however, Is not likely as far
as we can judge from events taking

Pie was a man without fear. The
greater the danger, the greater the dif
ficulty, the more keen he was to be
in the thick of it. He bucked like a
wild steed at every obstacle that stood
in his way, thus earning the name by
which he was best known.
His real name was William Owen
O'Neill. He was born of Irish par
ents, and was graduated from the Na
tional Law School of the District of
Columbia.
The West appealed to his love of ad
venture and thither he bent his foot
steps. Then commenced a life so
strange and varied that it reads like
the yellow covered dime books that
boys devour.
For months he tracked train robbers
over the desert, through perilous
gorges and dangerous abysses, finally
capturing them single handed and
earning the reward offered by the rail

With the money obtained at such

Arizona Miner, which he sold shortly
afterward, and started the Phoenix
Herald.
Then newspaper life began to pall on
him. He thirst-. i for the thrill ot
er ami the excitement ol a<
ture. He found bold at the mines.
But the gamblers, social outcasts, des
peradoes and adventurers respected
Buckey O'Neill. His aim was steady
and his nerve was true. Men who
were not looking for trouble never tri
fled with Buckey O'Neill. He was al
ways the friend of the poor, thr weak
and the oppressed.
Luck wan against him at the mines
and he deserted them to return to
Prescott, and established Che Hoof and
Horn, a cattleman's paper.
He had as an assistant a man of
similar fiber. Quick Jackson could
shoot true, tree a robber, sot type and
do anything well that he was . â¢ailed on
to do in the West. Both men had a
passion for gambling. Every Satur
day night after accounts were made up
they Bat down In the office to a game
of poker. The boys about town had
a habit of dropping in to see how
things were fOlng. For neither Jack
son nor O'Neill would stop as long as
they had a cent to ante. When his
money gave out Buckey would put up
his coat and vest; when everything else
was gone h<- would stake the paper.
Part of the time Buckey owned and
edited the Hoof and Horn, and Jack-
Son was an assistant on salary. The
other half of the year Quick Jackson
owned and edited the Hoof and Horn
and Buckey O'Neill was an assistant on
salary. It all depended on how tho
jpoker game went.
course it all depends entirely on just
what these changes really are. But
they certainly appear to be similar to
such as could occur on the surface of
the earth. Perhaps at the next oppo
sition the great Yerkes telescope may
settle the question definitely for us.
These remarkable changes on the
surface of Mars have occupied the at
tention of the greatest astronomers
that ever lived. Of course the near
ness of the planet during the period
of opposition has acted as a stimulus
t>Â» this. Something new has been
found out ai each period.
The most important of modern
times was the discovery of the
"canals" by Schiaparelli. So startling
was this discovery, which seemed to be
a proof of the habitation of the planet
by mortals of some decree of intelli
gence, that only a few astronomers
en dited it. For a long t!m<^ the dis
er was credited with having a
splendid imagination. Rut at the next
. [tion his claims v.vn- verified and
Schiaparelli took rank at the head of
liis profession.
'I hese "canals" are markings so accu

They made It a rule of the game that
all stakes must be laid on the table.
Often Quick Jackson sat with Buckeyes
money, jewelry, hat, coat, vest and
bill of sale of the paper piled up in
front of him. As often Jackson lost
his all and Buckey went home tri
umphant.
One night, when Jackson had noth
ing mure to lose, and Buokey's passion
betting was still unsatisfied, he
v.-. >v to a saloon and played faro. He
Boon lost all his money and with the
fever still on played away Jackson's
watch, which he had won a short time
tn the poker game.
Now, Jackson particularly wanted a
chance to win back this watch in a
poker game, and so he determined to
gel eve] on Buckey for playing it
away and not giving him the first
â  tn recover it.
Jackson quietly bided his time.
The first night that luck was with
him he evened up the score. After
winning i:uekey's money, vest, coat
and overcoat, ho suddeny said he had
an appointment and gathering up his
winnings departed before "Buckey"
had a chance to realize what he was
doing.
Hitherto the losing- man had ahvays
been allowed the use of his clothes un
til he could win them back.
On this night the snow was a foot
deep and the night was bitterly cold.
Buckey, sans hat, sans coat of any
sort had to plow through the snow
ami beg a coat at one store, borrow a
hat at a second, and steal an umbrella
at a third. Buckey appreciated the
joke but he never risked a second one
by playing- Jackson's property against
faro or any other game.

that it seems impossible that they
could be the work of chance. In some
instances they were parallel and in
others perfect circles. At times some
appear very- strong and at others weak,
just as if they contained water at dif
ferent stages. They also appear to be
made on a definite plan. Just what
they are has not yet been proved to
the entire satisfaction of scientists.
It is a notable fact that the canals do
not appear in that portion of the planet
where the sand sea is.
Although the theory of the sand sea
Is generally accepted a number of other
theories equally as tenable have been
advanced and received with favor by
learned men. The most important of
these is that what appears to be sand
i? in reality a vegetable growth that
the inhabitants have induced by irri
gation. The directions taken by the
canals are pointed out as strong proof
of this. And the fact that the surface
is red is held to be no proof that it is
not vegetable. The fact that grass is
green on the earth is no proof that it
is not red on Mars, if it exists at all.
Concerning the mental powers of the
inhabitants of Mars, if they do exist,
these phenomenon are surely an indi
cation. If common red sand blown by
the wind has been allowed to cover
hundreds of thousands of square miles
it must be conceded that the people are
far behind us in brain power. If on the
other hand they have succeeded in "re
claiming" a mountainous country by a
system o'J irrigation, then surely they
are our equals, if not our superiors.
Even if it is ever shown conclusively
that they built the so-called canals
they have accomplished greater won
ders than has ever been done on the
earth. One of these canals, named the
"A'thye," is nearly 2,000 miles long and
as straight as a ruler. If one like it in
size were constructed on the earth it
would reach from San Francisco to the
Mississippi River. Should it ever be
shown that the canals are the work of
nature, then surely is Mars a wonderful
planet.
brought Buckev the office of Sheriff of
Yavapai County. His reputation as a
fearless upholder of Justice was
thoroughly lived up to. He was the
best shot in the Territory and became
the terror of lawbreakers. That he did
not lose his life in some of the desper
ate fights in which he engaged seemed
miraculous.
He held various other offices, the last
one that of Mayor of Prescott. The
only vote against him in the election
was his own. He had long since given
up drinking and gambling and had
married a gentle, sweet woman to
whom he was devoted. When the call
for "arms" sounded over the land
"Buckey" formed a company of men
ready to do and die for their country.
They were proud of their gallant
leader.
"Buckey" rode away at the head of
his rough riders, to the front. He wrote
to a friend a letter from San Antonio,
in which he said: "I am ready to take
all chances. Who would not gamble
for a- new star on the "flag"?
This time he had put up his life and
lust. But though he was cut off so
soon in the fray, he had already dis
tinguished himself. At Daiquiri, in
making the rough landing to the shore,
two privates fell from the lighter into
the sea. In a second "Buckey," who
saw their danger, jumped overboard
and swam toward them. But the light
er swung round and crushed both men
before he could reach them.
Buckey died at the head of his com
pany in the thick of the fight. He fell
tierhting for his country as had his
father before him. who was Captain

At daylight of the 16th the ships
moved in toward the batteries as di
rected, and immediately opened fire.
The batteries on shore replied prompt
ly and rapidly for perhaps half an
hour, then gradually ceased firing. The
scene during the battle was grand be
yond description. We, on the Scor
pion, fired 258 rounds. No one was
hurt on our side. The Spaniards seem
to be yery poor gunners. How much
harm we did to them could not be
ascertained, but our Bring was excel
lent and I feel sure we did considera
ble damage.
We have established a base, as you
may be aware, at Guantanamo, on the
Cuban coast, about thirty-nve miles
eastward of Santiago. This nlace was
captured by 600 marines, assisted by
â¢several of our ships. It is a beautiful
little bay, well protected from the sea.
Rome such place was absolutely neces

comfortably seated in the neat little unprotected house,
protecting from all comers the neat little widow.
"But I must be goins." he said for tne tenth time.
"It's getting late and the snow gets deeper every minute."
"Yes, Mr. Strait."
"I was thinking you must be very lonely here sinceâ
you knowâ"
The widow's eyes ceased to twinkle, and winked away
a tear or two.
"It is lonely, Mr. Strait," she answered him.
"It's not lonely up at the post," said Fin, and rubbed
the crossed brass "sabers on his hat with sudden fury.
The widow sighed.
"But I can't live at the post, Mr. Strait," she an
swered, and stood In the middle of the floor, thoughtfully
playing with her marriago ring. The farrier looked at her
timidly, tenderly.
"Sit down. Mrs. Bell," he cried, desperately. "If you
can't find a chair, sit down here-"
And he pulled the widow on his knee.
"Oh. Mr. Strait!" said Mrs. Bell, but resisted very
gently. â¢
"Will you come and live at the post as my wife?" the
farrier whispered, but the wicked widow, conscious of an
offer from the corporal now in her pocket, played with the
farrier.
"Oh, Mr. Strait," she said, "you soldiers at the post

At that there came a modest rap at the door, and the
widow jumped to open it. It is probable that she knew
who It was. for the twinkle of her eyes betrayed a love of
mischief, but she evinced great surprise at seeing Corp
Healy standing in the snow. She threw the door wide
and hospitably open.
"Why, Mr. Healy," said she.^'to think you'd come

whom lh.- folks at the post call the brethren, you're so
thick and Buch old friends, and you've never met at my
house before. How funny!"
So She chattered, while her lips were yet red with
honest Fin's kis*. and Healy' S appeal crumpled in her
pocket.

He shot the last words angrily at his old friend, ana
as quickly as the defiance reached his ear Fin took a step
forward. Healy turned to the widow and bowed with still,
soldierly formality. â .
"I'll be likely in town to-morrow, said he, on the

At once the farrier laced the widow.

trembling. Â _. .. Â
"Corporal," she stammered, "Mr. Strait.
They were swiftly gone, however, the farrier closing
the door behind him, and the widow sat down, no little
frightened at such sudden mutual wrath.
"The two silly old things," she murmured. To go and
fight when one's just as nice as the other. '
111.
The snow had ceased falling and the air was colder as
the two soldiers strode away from the llttlf house, up the
trail to the post, in grim silence for many minutes. Healy,
his chin sticking out. his thin lips rigidly tight, marched
on blindly, clenching and unclenching his great bony
hands A pacr> to the corporal's rear Fin followed, but he,
after the llrst few hundred yards, so far conquered his
passion as to attempt nonchalance. He forced himself to
whistle, and lessened the angry determination of hia
stride. They wore near the old bridge, and at the sound
of that apparently merry tuno Healy stopped in tht- deep
shadow <>f the cottonwoods and fai.-ed his old crony. Healy
threw off his coat.
"We're no recrootk-s, to want the whole troop to see
us, Fin Strait," said he. "We can trust each other fur
fair play."
Fin laughed uneasily, and did not take off his coat.
His anger was apt to cool more quickly than the other's.
â¢Wat's eatin' you, Healy?" In- asked. "We ain't re
crooties, as you say. an' before I fight I want to know
what I'm rightin' about. It's the woman, of course."
"So it is," said Healy, shortly. "Whip me, an" go fur
yer answer to-morrow. If 1 whip you, sure 'tis t'other
way."
"Choo. I've a right to court her, an' now the blood's
cooled, I'll grant you've the same. But wnafs the use
of our flghtin' about a thing's settled. She had her choice,
free and fair, an' she's choosed. What's the good of
kickin'?"
"Yls, she's choosed," said Healy, fiercely. "An' whin
I've whipped yez fur yer interfarin' to-night, to-morrow
she'll say 'yis' to me."
"Ye're late for inspection, Healy, my t>oy. he said.
" 'Twas to-night she snt on my knee and kissed me. Isn t
that as good as saying 'yes'?"
"You lie! You lie!"
"Go easy! Ye'd better take that back!"
"Ye're a dirty liar! She wuz in me arrms this very
day! Wull yez fight, ye liar?"
In a second Fin's coat was thrown on the snow.
The affair was a very vulgar one â two common
soldiers of an age to know better, of a friendship which
should have been above such folly, battering each other
brutally with fists for the hand of a woman whose late
husband had been a Government teamster. It is to be
conceived, however, that the sneering moon never looked
down upon a combat fought by young lovers with honest
wounded hearts more fiercely aflame.
In utter silence they fought until the snow was beaten
and scattered by their dancing feet. There was no need
here of seconds, no need of an arbiter of the code. Feint.
parry, smash; a moment's play for breath, a close, a
tie; up and come again. The old boys were strictly
honest, and, though none saw save that flying moon and
an occasional jackrabbit startled in its tracks, each would
have scorned to take an unfair advantage, to be guilty
of a foul. Round after round, with all memory of their
former comradeship forgotten, with no thought save the
mad ones of a Jealous rivalry, they struggled together.
There was little difference in their weights, but Healy
was the wirier, and neither man's wind was as good as in
the days of early campaigns. So it happened that, after
half an hour's fierce fighting, when both were bloody, and
both more full of wrath than ever, they fell together and
rolled in thi- trampled snow, too blown to spring up.
Healy had the upper hold, and he cried in Fin Strait s
ear:
"Tek it backâ about the kiss! Tek it back an" swear
yell lave the widdy be!"
Fin gasped a sturdy, fierce defiance, and Healy's hand
was raised over him. when there came faintly thrilling
over the snow the clear note of a bugle. Healy's hand
dropped" "harmlessly and he raised his head and pricked
his ears liko a dog at the call of his master. More loudly
rang the bugle, and suddenly the rivals were apart, sit
ting in the snow, listening Intently.
Tls boots an' saddles!" cried Fin. "An* me not at
the stables!"
With that each seized his coat, and. nil regardless of
their bruised faces and blood-stained shirts, they ran
swiftly to the post. There was rushing of men to the cor
rals, the sharp commands of officers, th<> click of revolvers
as they were hastily loaded, saddling of horses, curses of
men belated, hasty issuing of ammunition, and at last the
cool, clear voice of the captain of the troop:
"Prepare to mount! Mount! Form ranks'."
The corporal and the farrier were in their accustomed
places, breathing hard. Hushed and bloody, but ready â
ready as any lance corporal there, the pride of a first ser
geant's heart. Then a whisper passed from man to man
down the line of horsemen.
"There's an outbreak on the Snake River Reserve.
They've killed the agent, and the reds have massacred a
ranchman and his family."
But this midnight expedition, although It thrilled the
hearts of younger men, troubled the minds of the two
veterans little. They rode on as a matter of duty, just as
they would, if ordered, have gone through the maunal of
arms. The unfinished fight had left them with heated
brains too full of jealousy and disappointment and hate
to do more than brood over the fancied treachery of each.
Gone now were all memories of strirrup to stirrup
charges, of friendly frolics, of pains and pleasures shared
together. True comrades once they were bitter foes now.
They reached the place before daylight, seeing nothing
before "them, but all at once they beard the yapping of
dogs and the shrill voices of squaws, and the chant and
yells of blood-frenzied savages. In the fancied security
of the storm the reds in their tepees were celebrating
their hideous triumph to the monotonous beat of the
drum and the shrill song of the warriors and the dance
of the warpath.
The grim captain halted his column and gave his
orders, and in a minute every man was tense, revolver at
tht ready, bridle hand firm.
"Forward, march! Trot, march! Gallop, march!"
And loud and clear there followed the stirring yell,
"Charge." and the clean-cut note of the trumpet, that one
long heart-thumping note that sends a man to death as
willingly as to the dance. Down they went on the camp.
Into the blackness of the night, into the whirl of the bliz
zard, and at once it was Impossible to see one's right-hand
man or keep aligned. It was each man for himself, with
tb.e thought of a murdered woman and child to steel his
heart and nerve his hand and direct his aim. The Indians
were not all unready. Their arms were at hand, and very
Quickly they realized that the white men had braved even
the blizzard to seek revenge and were upon thm. In a
tumult of yells and hasty orders the chiefs sprang to repel
the attack. Jn a moment all was a corner of hell.
In the midst of it, right in the center of the camp,
two men came crush together, and in that instant recog
nized each other. In nelthx r*s mind was even that charge
the uppermost thing. Vith a sudden mutual curse their
rage was let loose. Healy extended his arm and fired, not
two yards from his old comrade. Old Fin. the farrier.
gave* a terrible scream, and Healy saw him drop. But
even in falling the veteran sought revenge, and his pistol
was discharged. The corporal felt a stinsc in his side; the
all suddenly ceased, and he also dropped inanimate
from his horse.
In a little separate room in the post hospital the old
campaigner came out of his fever, out of the delirium.
weeks after the fight on the Snake River. The doctor was
with him. and a stiffly upright and martial attendant.
He got well pretty quickly, for, as the doctor paid, he
had the constitution of a horse. One warm day he was
peremptorily ordered out. much against his will, to take
the air on the broad veranda which ran around the hos
pital. He got himself comfortable in a low chair In a
quiet corner and began for the hundredth time to go over
all the murdered man had done for him in those long,
active years of fun and fighting. His head drooped on his
breast and he dumbly thought of suicide. Round the
corner of the house came the unmistakable thump, thump
of a man on crutches. Healy's eyes sought the corner
vacantly. In an instant they opened wide with fear and
he *ose" to his feet, spreading out his hands to fend off
something horrible. The man on the crutches stopped.
He was pale with long- sickness when he turned the
corner, but now his face colored and his eyes lit up wTTh
sudden unspeakable relii t and joy.
"Howly mother, detind me! 1 ' cried Healy. "Aw, fur
mo sins, it's thrue I killed him. but I'm near crazy fur
the sorro' uv it. I'll confess it all, Fin. an' be hanged like
a man. Ye can have the widdy. her, if she's any good
to yea now. but go back to your grave an' lave me De, fur
the sake of ould toimes!"
"Healy! Healy!" gasped the man on crutches, hopping
toward him. "I've been feared to ask. I thought I killed
you. Healy, you old chump! Healy! Oh, Lord, I'm
thankful for this!"
"Fin." said Healy, slowly erasing to tremble. "Is it
rale fiish an' blood yez are? Me God, but I can't believe
it!"
But a touch of familiar hands reassured the veteran,
and in another minute the two sat side by side, andâ
there were no recruits to seeâ their hands were clasped
in each other's and their eyes were wet. They did not
refer, save briefly, to their nearly fatal quarrel, under
standing that each, in a moment's madness, had fired on
her, and each, when convalescent, had been afraid
to ask for news of his friend. For a long time they were
silent, until old Fin looked slyly at the corporal.
"She's married!" he said abruptly.
"Chuh!" said Healy.
"To the schoolmaster Graves." said Fin.
"The divil," said Healy, and suddenly laughed loudly.
"Healy," said the farrier, solemnly, "weemin la
frauds."
"Ye're might, so ye are, Fin," said the corporal, and
hitched up his chair more closely to Strait's, with a sigh
of content.

t\ It is an acknowledged fact that The Call

ff the Maine was blown u\< in Havana Harbor >^ . A
' last February up to the present time. To do >^ 1
this has been no light task. It has taken hun- S *
dreds of men and the constant use of several S
dispatch boats. >^
.w- -i -,^*â -^ At present the entire world is covered. /
râf-r There are Call correspondents at every port^
II mW Where there is likely to be any news. All of S
\\A\ V Cuba is covered, as well as the Hawaiian Isl- S
mm finds, the Ladrones, the Philippines and even â¢
VW the ports of the SiÂ»z Canal, as well as other /
' strategic points. Ev*Jb' city in Europe where S
there is likely to be diplomatic news there is /
a Call correspondent. The result has been /
that readers of the. Call have been given the
news and not mere floating rumors.
As soon as the signs of hostility grew oml
nous, the Call prepared for the days to come.
In Iditlon to having its regular correspond
ents all over the world,' the Call formed a
co-operative plan with the New York Herald,
by which the splendid news service of that
big daily was at its disposal.
As the uews comes to Call readers in the
morning there la nothing to indicate the
amount of work, hardship, judgment and
danger that was necessary to secure it. But
many a simple paragraph has only been ob
tained at the risk of some man's life.
When the wai began it found the Call-Her
ald with men at every station in air.. Cuba
and the United States where anything in the
events that preceded the struggle might hap
pen and where any news might come. It had
reporters in the field with the Cubans and
others â ..ith the armies of Spain. In the
north and the south of the United States its
correspondents felt the pulse of the people in
the filibustering expeditions that. preceded by
several years the open declaration of hostility.
Through all this time, while the American
Congress v. as indicating in speeches and reso
lutions that peace ould not long exist and
the Spanish iple in Madrid and Caba were
openly expressing their rage at the prospect
of American interference, the Call-Herald
had men clos^ to the whirlpools of anger.
The cable from Havana to Key West and
the lines thence to the Call's office in San
Francisco were open then and almost free.
News could be sent through with little inter
ference, save when the Spanish Censor step
ped in to prevent the publication of what
seemed to him to be reflections on the honor
of his country and his countrymen.
Then both nations drifted to the verge of
war and Havana established strict censor
ship. But the public demanded all the news,
and the Call-Herald obtained and presented
it without a break by putting into service at
once the first of a fleet of dispatch boats.
In Pensacola, Fla.. was obtained the Som
mers N. Smith, which is owned by the pilots'
association of that port, and is a craft so
stanch that in her one could make a trip
around the world. In the few months of her
existence before filibustering gave the United
States so much costly trouble the Smith had
made many a night trip into nut of the way
harbors in Cuba, and had put ashore for the
insurgents hundreds of thousands of rounds
of ammunition that had helped to prolong the
struggle of Gomez and his men until the
United States could take the burden from
them.
The crisis was fast approaching, and watch
ing it in the Cuban capital were Hamilton
Peltz, Ernest W. McCready and Walter S.
Meriwether. Day after day, when the world
was waiting, anxious for the news from the
center of interest â they sent dispatches
across by dispatch boat to Key West, graph
ic, accurate, that never would have passed
the Spanish censor, because they told the
whole truth. Correspondents of other papers
sat helpless in Havana. They could not use
the cable for the news they could gather;
they had no dispatch boats.
In Havana some of the time, in the fiMri
The first engagement of the war was over
and The Cali-Hf-rald's men, outside of officers
n the fleet, were the only ones who
knew about it. Off dashed the Summers N.
Smith fur Key West, through a storm, carry
ing the Admiral's official report, and The
Call the following day was the- only paper on
the Pacific Coast to tell the Btory.
A few day3< later, when' the other side of
the world was hear from. The Call and Herald
alone of all newspapers published In the
world, told the .full Htory of Dewey'a thence
famous victory :it Manila. Joseph L. Stick
ney performed that peerless feat. He was
himself a part of the battle he so pictur
esquely and completely described.
He la a graduate ot Annapolis and had
been a lieutenant in the navy. He was at
Hongkong when Dewey started out to do his
part In the humbling of Spain and was taken

by the Admiral on his flagship, the Olympla,
In the battle he was a volunteer aid of the
Admiral, and on the bridge of "the Olympia
he watched the progress of glorious victory
and took snapshots of the stirring scenes
around him. The Spaniards, foreseeing the
downfall of Manila, had cut the cable, and tc
get the great news to The Call and Herald
he had to go to Hongkong. He went and sent
through the finest, most complete account ol
an actual naval fight that 'ever has been
printed. In Dewey's official report he was
commended for his services in the hction.
As soon as the news of the victory at
Manila was told The Call at once dispatched
a corps of writers and artists to the Philip
pines. Among these were Sol N. Sheri
dan, one of the best writers on the Coast.
Pierre A. Boeringer, well known as an artist
and T. A. Healy, a thorough newspaper man.
At Honolulu, Alice Rix will tell Call readers
of whatever happens of interest. With this
corps Call readers will be sure to be supplied
with all the news.
As an illustration of the completeness of
The Call's war service is the location of the
fleet of Admiral Cervera at the Cape Verde
islands, and the exclusive information given
at the same time to the authorities in Wash
ington and the rest of the public that it had
Balled in tiit- direction Of Porto Kico. To ob
tain this news The Call-Herald had a ship
follow the Sn,;iiiards for twenty-four hours.
Later, when Cervera had been an unplaced
quantity for days, Call-Herald men found
him at Martinique and gave the first news to
the President.
To obtain a general idea of San Juan, the
Tyr one day put close in toward that harbor
and steamed slowly by. Suddenly out from
thing to do in the way of repairs were reliev
ing Incidents. Then came the daring feat of
\_ Hobson. Every newspaper, but The Call and
>- Herald misunderstood the brilliant feat of
v the naval constructor. Why was the Merri
\mac sunk? The others answered that the
collier was sent into the harbor of Santiago
*^v to force a passage through which Sampson
could go to reach Cervera. The Call-Her-
aid's men on its dispatch boats told the pub
'â :'- lie that Hobson's entrance to the hell of Span
>v ish fire was made for the purpose of keeping
Xthe enemy's ships inside. They were right.
Hobson, as we all know now was taken
.prisoner by Cervera himself. It was the
V>. Spanish Admiral who told that story to The
X. Call-Herald for the first time when he was
being taken as a prisoner to Portsmouth on
I the St. Louis. At that time, however, it waa '
not even known that Cervera himself was in
the bottle. Spanish ships were there, but wos
their commander? Spanish ships outside had
been reported to the administration.
The answer was sent to the navy and the
public. A cablegram was dispatched to tha
Spanish Admiral, who promptly replied, giv
ing his assurance that Hobson was being well
cared for. That settled it. Cervera was in
the bottle. He signed the message himself.
About this time came the movement of the
troops that had been whipped into shape in
the Southern camps. To Cuba with them
went Richard Harding Davis, to add to his
\ sea experience by closer work ashore. John
I C. Klein went along, too, and Alcides Betan
* court, eager to see close conflict in which his
i people, the Cubans, would be wit.i the United
States troops against the Spaniards.
â¢> The Mindora went into r.ction with Leo L..
Redding aboard, the Golden Rod with Hould-
V er L. Hudgins. A superb squadron there was
when these boats joined the others in the
news patrol between Santiago and Guanta
namo. â  â. . " ; ,
Marines had landed at the latter place,
where the Stars and Stripes now float un-
I disturbed over Fort McCalla.
All along those fortified miles of Cuban
coast between Santiago and Guantanamo the
fighting went from that time almost ceasQ
lessly on at sea and in the Cuban jungles.
In front of Shafter's camp at Siboney Call-
I Herald boats were on station July L and
they were ready to get to top speed in a few
minutes. That day the American forces
made their first grand combined rush on the
I enemy and, leaving many of their number

I That day Nicholas Biddle was with them

STRANGE CEREMONY
Attending Turmeric MaKing Among the South
The manufacture of turmeric is one of the most interesting of Samoan
customs. It resembles a religious rite and bears strong traces of Mosaic
origin. The utmost purity, both in mind and body, is demanded of the
â¢workers, all of whom are women.
LOSSA, Lossa, aren't you coming
to see the lenga made?"
I sighed. I had been urgently
hurried home through the blaz
ing sunshine, and now, after
reaching the cool, airy house, I
was calmly requested to walk out
afresh into the blaze. Of course I
wanted to see, but the lwunge, the fresh
draught and the chastened light were
very tempting, so I sighed again.
"You mustn't do that, Lossa," says a
small Samoan, with a dirty bit of sack
ing knotted around her waist.
"What mustn't I do?"
"Look cross. You can't see the lenga
if you look cross; it will go bad."
"Oh!" I was exceedingly astonished.
I had heard of s<>ur looks turning the
milk in old-fashioned dairies, but the
sensitiveness of lenga, otherwise tur
meric, was an altogether new idea.
"Cross looks and angry words burn
up the lenga in the oven," continued
my mentor. "You're laughing/ Well,
it's true; but if you laugh you may
come. Here, Kileva, Elesivi, Tualava,
Lossa's coming!"
1 passed through a native hut
into a square inclo-sure alive with busy
workers, screened with palm leaves and
shaded by the broad branches of a pua
tree, formerly the home of a god. For
a moment 1 thought 1 had stepped into
a churchyard festival. Split cocoanut
busks, outlining grave-shaped ovals, on
which lay fresh banana leaves, were
unpleasantly suggestive. But a second^
glance at the underlying orange tint
and the general surroundings set me
speculating wildly. Had I stumbled on
a new edition of the old Fete dcs Fous,
with its donkey procession? What else
could be Indicated by that enormous
pile of carrots the old ladies were so
busy Bcraplng?
Then I remembered that I was in a
land where the carrot groweth not and
the donkey is a rare visitor. So I sat
down on my mat and demanded infor
mation.
A dozen voices hurled it at me. "Had
I never seen the ango root? It was
ango now, but it would be lenga soon;
some <>[ it was becoming lenga already
In the troughs."
"Mamma" is head scraper, the
nominal "mamma" of the whole

ous to particularize. My glance wan

are busying themselves round the

have seen many washings. But above
the shoulders coquetry has had fair
play; the dark eyes and Hashing teeth,
the dark hair with gleams of gold are
set off by red hibiscus and pomegranate
flower and fragrant "nau" leaves.
They are flitting to and fro
In the sunshine, bearing buckets of
water, ladling the bright orange liquid
with cocoanut shells, arranging the
long banana leaves as carefully as
though putting some baby to sleep in
Us cradle.
A coacoanut leaf mat, stiffly
plaited, Is supported by the husk
border and lined with overlap
ping banana leaves; above this,
on a rough framework protected
by hanging banana leaves, is slung an
other mat, fresh and green, forming a
basket sieve; in it are laid broad strips
of fiber torn off the cocoanut trunk â na
ture's own weaving, finer and closer
than horsehair sieve â and in this the
grated turmeric root Is laid. Then
come the damsels, their cocoanuts
brimful of water which they cast into
the sieve, while their Stsili stirs up the
ruddy mass and a stream of vivid
orange splashes the hanging leaves and
pours into the glistening green trough.
No stinted labor or bungling work here.
When the trough is full the process be
gins afresh; again and again the muddy
orange liquid is lifted in the shells and
re-strained, till the hanging leaves turn
golden, the sieve looks like a miniature
claypit, the workers' hands and faces
assume a brassy appearance and their
dingy draperies are enlivened with daba
of yellow. At last the straining Is pro
nounced sufficient, slight laths are laid
across the trough, over them more
leaves to shelter from the sun's rays,
and the liquid lenga is left to settle.
Then my garlanded Cinderellas re
treat into the cool hut to show Lossa
their own special work at their own
very particular trough. Along the floor
lies a broken canoe, from It rise at reg
ular intervals peeled stems round
which rough sennit had been tightly
twisted, and from each stem depends a
long banana leaf. Down squat the
Cinderellas, cross-legged, each In front
of her own leaf; another leaf she care
fully lays on her lap, for when your
dress is particularly dirty it is desirable
not to splash it. T'p go the Cinderella
hands in pairs, holding closely clasped
a bit of scraped turmeric root which
they bring down the sennit-circled
stem with strong, slow motion; up and
down, up and down, the lithe brown
arms move evenly, dropping orange
flakes against the green background,
and as they grate their voices rise and
they sing, slowly and solemnly, a part

Evidently turmeric making is a func

time being family ties are broken. No

turmeric-; they sleep together, eat to
gether, work together, sing together
and ignore the existence of that disso
nant note, Man. And every alternate
night they rouse up at 12 o'clock to sit
before their' troughs, grate their roots
and sing their songs, till morning
dawns and tired heads nod on brown
shoulders.
And this is the Law of the Lenga:
Thou shalt not quarrel, lest thou gaze
upon the turmeric with an evil eye;
neither shall thy neighbor quarrel, lest
the sound thereof reach the turmeric
house; neither : hall any be at variance
In the village lest the air be polluted
with dissension. And If any in the vil
lage fight with his neighbor, or
frown upon his brother; or if any
woman fight over the lenga and gaze
upon it with an evil eye; or if any carry
evil tales, eat outside the turmeric
house, touch of food of which those out
side have partaken, or greedily conceal
food which she does not share with her
lenga sisters, then shall the gathering
be broken up and each woman return
untit her own home, lest the turmeric
be spoilt and the village win 111 fame.
For the Law of the Lenga is the Law of
Love.
Next morning T am sent for to see
the lenga oven. The inclosure is the
same scene of activity as yesterday but
the contents of some of the cradles are
altered. A pale yellow scum has risen
leaving a thick, greasy orange sedi
ment on the green leaves. This pre
cious sediment the girls are not allowed
to touch; witch-like dames crouch over
oval wooden bowls and strain it again
and again through palm fiber, till at
last consistency is pronounced perfect
and a small bowlful handed inside the
hut, where one of the Clnderellas
awaits it. She is rightfully placed
now, bending over a circular fireplace
enclosed cornerwlse with mats, while
her hand holds daintily a cocoanut
shell like an inverted acorn with the
cup struck off; a shell polished with
much use, its inside oiled and stained
with the red juice of the oa tree.
Cinderella plugs the small hole at the
tip, pours in some liquid lenga with the
help of a leaf and tenderly deposits her
brown acorn beside the glowing em
bers. When two or three cups are
thus set on end she heaps over them
several dozen leaves of the laupata,
heart-shaped leaves with red vetoing,
far too pretty to be shriveled and
smoked in this lavish fashion. Then it
is politely hinted to me that my pres
ence is no longer required, the lenga
will take some hours to bake and I can
see the results next day.
So I do. The Sisili In person comes to
call, and from the depths of a green
basket, out of manifold leaf wrappers,
she produces three of the acorns look-
Ing none the worse for their roasting.
A clean leaf Is laid on my unworthy
hand, the acorn plug is removed, the
apex held to my mouth, and I am sol
emnly requested to blow hard. I pro
duce a whistling sound, and slowly
there glides out an acorn shaped,
slimy orange substance, a lenga jaune
mange which I am asked to admire as
an artistic triumph. Isn't it smooth and
glossy and perfect in shape? Did Lossa
ever in her life see the like? Well, no,
on her honor, Lossa never did, so she
sits and admires the yellow acorn

Miss Carrie de Mar at the Orpheum this

manufactured in Paris and procured at a
cost of 'steen dollarsâ possibly more.
The rim and crown are made of flexible

for the nodding- plumes are ever in full

the l>rim and crown the trimming is
orange cftlffon, neatly shirred. A wealth
of tall ostrich plumes lend a swell effect.
The style of the hat is of what is known
in Paris us La Militaire, and a black vel

sit off to good advantage Miss de Mar's
pretty face. That this style of hat should
Bver become popular with femininity in

A very nic< trimming is made of braid

In this way. But for the woman

The tiniest lace edge is used upon
ribbon frills. Upon frills of organdie
and other thin goods there may be very
tiny, narrow ribbon edges sewed fast,
or edg>-s of light. Huffy silk trim"
or lace. The rule for a frill is that it
must look dainty. It can never have a
heavy appearance, otherwise It will
lack it tial qualification.
The ruffle around the foot <.f the
skirt, or as it Is often called, the duat
ruffle, is so fashionable this summer
that Its prea â¢:â â  â¢â  is more common than
its omission. Almost every X-ray skirt
or the skirt of almost every thin

has this ruffle around the foot. This
may be three Inches deep, headed with
a frill. It need not be very full, scarcely
more than full enough to set around
the foot.
Ruining is as popular as it was ten
3* ars ago. Then every skirt was
trimmed with ruffles around the foot.
These have come in again and have
taken up their old time popularity. The
only difference is in the way that they
are put on. Instead of setting straight
nd the skirt they take a curve, and
this gives the overskirt effect which is
si i much seen upon summer dresses.
Ruffles that are put on In curved fash
ion should be very carefully set upon
tin- skirt. The skirt should be marked
Into quarters and the ruffles should be
quartered and pinned in place. After
they are pinned the skirt should be
tried on and if a ruffle stands out in an
awkward fashion in any spot it is a
sure sign that it is not pinned on
straight. This should be corrected be
fore the skirt is stitched.
Another word of caution to the wo
man who makes her own ruffles; be
sure that they are sewed fast. Noth
ing cat (lies on objects as quickly as
the ruffle and nothing is more easily
torn off. The sight of half a yard of
ruffle hanging from a pretty mull dress
is not inspiring. If the ruffle is sewed
on the machine, care should be taken
that the tension is loose enough so that
the ruffle will not bmd upon the skirt.
In fact, hand work is to Be preferred
to sewing machine work in this mat
ter, as the stitch can be a little loose,
yet very strong.
Bicycle skirts are trimmed with
braid. Frills and lace are out of place
upon the wheel, but bicycle skirts are
trimmed just the same. T.raid is
sewed upon duck and light cloth goods,
the box plaited skirts are trimmed
with narrow rows of soutache. Tht*e
are sowed on abundantly one by one
until the back of the skirt is nicely
trimmed while the front has its narrow
rows of braid around the foot. Old
bicycle skirts can be brought up-to-
Iditlon of a few rows of
braid put on in this way.
It is really remarkable how the fash
ion runs toward skirts that are
trimmed in the back. No matter how
plain the front, the back is made <!e<-
ve with braid, ribbon and other
material?.
Velvet is also used for a skirt trim-
: ming. I saw a dress of white duck
trimmed with very narrow bands of
velvet ribbon. These were lightly
sewed on along the upper edge, and
: were to be ripped oft when the dress

Extremely clever young women have
a way of trimming these light skirts
quickly. There is a very pretty ruff
ling which comes s<> that it can be
bin toned along the upper edge. The
rulHing is made of mull and edged with
; lace. It comes in all colors. Along
' the top is a very narrow band in which

Thank fortune the small foot mania is 1
Isappearing except In China, where
it is still customary to break and turn
under the toes of the high cast women
in order to arrest their growth.
The feet, to be really beautiful, should
be in proportion fi the rest of the struct- j
ure. Amelie Rives, in "The Witness of
the Sun." describes the Incongruity of
small hands and feet on women large of j
stature in this delicious way:
The ribbon sash is tied exactly in the
back, and the long, straight lines which
it gives to the figure are highly desira
ble. The girl who wears a skirt of lawn
unrelieved except by the dust ruffle un
der the feet, and a long double sash
tied at the back of her waist, is almost
classic in the lines of her figure.
HELEN WARD.
"Her big- limbs ended In tiny hands and
feet, which arc the Ideal of beauty with
si many women. As a Uttle girl Natalie
possessed the arms of a well-stuffed chair
and the legs of a piano. As a young lady,
voluminous sleeves and draperies only
permitted one to observe hands which
corresponded to the little tassels which
usually finish off chair arms and feet not
much !ar^Â«T thai the castors In which
piano legs always terminate."
In ancient statuary the human foot Is
shown to us in its purity, but. alas! how
far removed from this model is the mod
.â rn, fashionable foot, with Its twisted
toes, points pressed out of shape and
heels hoisted high in the air. It is un
doubtedly true, as has been often assert
ed, that hiph heels are the cause of many
of the diseases that make chronic Invar
liils of women. It stands to reason that
anything which throws the body out of
its natural position and pushes the feet
forward upon the toes must strain the
back and have an 111 effect upon the gen
eral health.
Shoes that are too loose rub the foot
and induce corns as often as those which
arc too tight.
Pointed toes are an abomination and are
certain to produce corns and enlarged toe
joints.
. The sensible shoe for a woman Is the
one that is long enough and broad enough
to admit of her throwing the ful weight
of the body upon the ball of the foot
without a feeling of uncomfortable press
ure anywhere. The heel should be low
and broad, the sole thick and the instep
and ankle firmly held, so that there is no
slipping around of the foot.
Above all things, never wear a lop-sided
shoe, or one that is run down at the
heel, or a shabby shoe. A trimly fitting,
fresh looking boot is one of the little
necessities of the feminine toilet that
goes a long way in the general make-up.
And, remember, there is nothing that
will BO Quickly produce a care-worn ex
pression and those distressing lines which
pain Invariably stamps upon the human
countenance, as a shoe that hurts.
The feet should always be kept warm,
particularly at night. If corns come and
it is not possible to secure the services
of a skilled chiropodist, the following
recipe will be found helpful:
FOR CORNS.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
MISS JENNY D.â The coarse hairs can
be removed permanently only by the use
of the electric needle. And even this is
not always successful; for if the base of
the follicle Is not reached by the needle,
the hair will sprout again and another op
eration will be necessary. You were wises
not to experiment with any of the adver
tised stu'Ts. Depilatory powders are usu
ally worthless, as they -merely burn the
hair off to the surface of the skin, and
it will certainly return.
CONSTANT READER.â AppIy witch
hazel to the red nose; alsb soak the hands
and feet in hot water. If the skin is
shiny rub a little rosewator on and then
apply a pure powder. The rosewater
makes the powder stick and keeps it
from showing. Do not use soap on the
face, and for the pimples wash the face
in water In which there is a dash of ben
zoin. Apply witchhazel every other night
and cold cream in between times. Facial
eruptions usually denote a disordered di
gestion and require something more than
local treatment.

Yes, the preparation you refer to can be

they may be next year or fifty years from
now. Cod liver oil is good to fatten up
on, but it is not a pleasant dose, and is too
heavy for some stomachs. Massaging the
neck with a good skin food will fatten it.
It is next to impossible to get rid of the
fuzz on the arms, so I should just forget
that it la there.
MOL.LIE HAWN.-Tii fatten the bands,
take equal parts of cocoa butter, oil of
I almonds and refined white wax.
Melt and stir until cold. Rub well into the
hands at night. White spots can usually
be removed from the nails by a paste
made of refined pitch and myrrh mixed
together. Apply the paste at night and
in the morning rub off with olive oil.
LOTTAâ Almonds are very soothing to
the skin, and the meal made from them
is said to soften and whiten it. The meal
can be used in place of soap, or you can
make a paste of It by moistening with
water. If used as a paste apply at night
and cover with soft linen or gloves.
BIRDIE Y. Z.â Loose clothing, exercise
with the arms, plenty of tepid baths and
a diet of good fattening foods, such as
rice, butter, potatoes, cereals, eggs, milk
and game are necessary to acquire devel
opment of the bust. First of all, then,
discard all pads and be sure that the un
dergarments do not confine at all. Then
massage gently with cocoanut oil. It will
take at least tight weeks of constant
massage before any development will be
noticeable, but it will surely come if per
sisted in. Exercise with dumbbvlls or In
dian clubs will help. For the hollows in
the neck and shoulders also massage
every night with the oil and go through
the following exercises night and morn
ing: Throw th(- head backward and for
ward twenty times, not rapidly nor vio
lently, just easily, but as far back and
aa far front as it will go. Then in the
same way from side to side twenty times.
After this twist the head around in its
socket as far as it will go, first one Way
and then the other, twenty times. If you
twist it the same way ail the time you
will become dizzy and possibly nauseated.
CHARLOTTE M.-For the oily skin try
the following:
Dried rose leaves, 1 ounce.
White wine vinegar, % pint.
Rose water, V 4 pint.
Pour the vinegar uiÂ»n the rose leaves
and let it stand for ;i week; then strain
and add the rose water, throwing the rose
leaves away.
The lotion may he used either pure by
dabbing the face with a cloth which has
been dampened with it nr by putting
about a tablespnonful into a cupful of
distilled water. This lotion must not Tie
used when soap has iust been applied,
because the acid of the vinegar will de
compose the soap and injury to the skin
will result.
KITTY M.â Charlotte M. also asked fÂ«r
rocipe for oily skin. Read what I have
said to her. Never use soap upon an oily
skin. Here is the recipe for a most ex
cellent cold cream:
Pure white wax % ounce
Spermaciti 1H ounce
Sweet almond oil V 4 ounce
Rose water % ounce
Thls will make enough cream to fill a
four-ounce jar. Insist upon your drup
pist using the exact proportions called
fur. It is rather expensive and can be
made at home very much cheaper. Ap
plying a tiny bit of cold cream to the
face before powdering is excellent. It
keeps the powder from showing, prevents
it getting into the pores, and gives the
skin that smooth velvety appearance
which is so sought after.
C. B. McC.âlt is difficult to say just
what is the cause of superfluous hair. It
is natural to some, and will grow, no
matter what efforts they make to arrest
its growth. With others it is superin
duced by the use of cold creams and
ur.gents containing inferior materials.
Many of the cold creams nought in the
shops are made upon a basis of lard,
which will often bring- forth a fine crop
of whiskers. Some times the extreme
growth <>f hair where it should not be
is the result of morbid constitution; some
times it is a feak of nature, and very fre-
I quently it comes from high livingâin

I inherited from those whose blood was
i made of too rich materials. So you see,
! it would be rather difficult to remove the
I cause. It certainly is annoying, but,
'. really, unless the fuzz is something aw
j ful, not one person in twenty will ever

ing these officials. In company with Dep
uty Sachem Cole, paid a visit to Manzan-
Ita Tribe and were present at the rais
ing up of the chiefs who are to serve for
the current term.
The reports for the term, which are be
ing received, show a very satisfactory
condition as to membership and finance.
Those tribes that took advantage of the
dispensation allowing suspended members
to return under certain conditions have
added quite a number to the membership.
In many instances the suspensions were
for non-payment of dues through inabil
ity to do so. The returns will show an
increase of nearly three hundred mem
bers. The greatest gains have been by
Osceolaâ 3s (hiring the term and 57 during
the year. Montezuma gained 2s, Poca
hontas 24, Cocopah IS, Iroriuois 16. Other
tribes show gains, but none so large.

INDEPENDENT FORESTERS.
The deputies nppointed by the high
chief ranger to attend to the several
courts in San Francisco have done their
work without pay and have been thus far
obliged to foot their own expenses. This
has been quite a heavy tax upon them,
and they have made an appeal to the
local courts for a small per capita con
tribution. Some have contributed the
amount asked for, but others have de
clined, not on account of the amount
asked for but on principle, namely, that
the deputies are working for the benefit
of the order and that their expenses
should be met by the Grand Court and
not by the individual courts.
A long time ago Deputy High Chief
Ranger Peery was voted a medal of merit
fur valuable services rendered in the dis

months have passed since the award was
made the Supreme officers have withheld
it. presum%biy on the ground that the
jurisdiction of California at the last held
session of the Supreme Court did not
coincide with everything that the Su
preme body did. This order has been
growing 1 to such an extent of late In the
United States that it may at no distant
day amend that portion of the constitu
tion that provides that the supreme chief
ranger, supreme past chief ranger, su
preme secretary and supreme treasurer
must be residents of the Dominion of
Canada.

ThJE RING'S JACKAL.
By Richard Harding Davis.
Richard Harding Davis has just
"turned out" another book; but it is not
a masterpiece. Still, with all the work
that Mr. Davis has on hand these days,
"The King's Jackal" is as good or better
than might be expected. At any rate,
it is good reading for a summer day and
leaves a pleasing: impression.
With a beautiful American heiress for
his heroine and a newspaper correspond
ent for his hero and an old, exiled King
to give an air of mystery and add to the
romance, the whole set against a back
ground of the warm, rich light of Tan
gier, Mr. Davis certainly has all the ma
terial he requires. The story contains

In some ways "The King's Jackal" is
an obvious echo of Daudet's "Rois en
Exil." Not consciously so, any more than
Daudot's copy of the dolls' dressmaker
from Dickens in "Fromont Jeune" was
conscious. But the resemblance exists.
The present King of Mesina is a pale
copy of Christian d'lllyrie, who was him
self (or was not) studied from the King
of Naples. Daudet says his own King and
Queen were a royal couple of pure Inven
tion, only he had lodged them as the King
and Queen of Naples were lodged, and
their "entourage" was more or less the
same.
The Duke of Brunswick, the King of
Hanover, "Citron the Silent," at Bignoh's
on a sofa in the back room, eating a slice
of foie gras in company with a "fllle de
carrefour." Such- were some of the royal
ties who passed before Daudet's eyes at
one time or another. He admits that
Christian had at least some points of re

Buena Vista Parlor, who assembled to
witness the installation of the officers for
the current term, the work being by Mrs.
Genevieve Baker, D. D. G. P.. assisted by
Mrs. Georgie C. Ryan, acting as past
grand president. The work Mas pt!r
formed with that exactness and dramatic
style which has won a reputation for the

past grand president was in an impres

equaled. The hall in which the cere

evergreens and patriotic emblems, anil i

Mr. I 'avis' King of Messina certainly
i has more than one with the King of Na
ples and with Prince Milan of Servia.
These resemblances are of little moment
: that he choosesâ l suppose like a
good republicanâ to paint his decayed and
fallen monarch without one redeeming
' trait. A redeeming trait would have mad*
! him more interesting. But the point is
that Mr. Davis has so saturated his mind
with Daudet's book that his own cannot
but remind us of the "Rois en Exil."
The difference between "would" and
"should" perplexes Mr. Davis, as it does
some other writers; or perhaps it is only
carelessness. He says, or he makes Prince
Kaloney say to Miss Carson: "I have
been more madly happy In just knowing
; that you live than I 'would' have been

I in love, Mr. Davis might reply, is entitled
j to take liberties with the English lan
i guage. But that excuse will not serve
I him when he says: "It was his nature
â¢ â¢ * to at once become a partisan"â a
very striking example of the split infini
, tive. Nor is it quite clear what Mr. Davis
means by a "momentous silence." nor
does it become clearer he-cause the silence
is also grim. Probably these lapses are
j due to haste, and, in a way. to the pub-
Just what Mr. Davis wished to bring out
lin his story is not quite clear. It might be
; any one of two or three things. If he mi
i tended to produce a strong story like
I "Soldiers of Fortune," and in spots It ap

a failure. If he simply intended to pro

bunch of roses, to which was attached a

This was followed by a short programme

On the evening of the 15th inst. the
members of Sans Soucl Parlor were treat
ed to an agreeable surprise by Miss Mil
lie Kline, the third vice president. Un
known to the members Miss Kline had
provided an excellent banquet of home
made delicacies, and at the close of the"
meeting she invited all present to enjoy
the treat. The membership was delighted
with the hospitality of the hostess, and the
kindly fraternal spirit displayed. An en
joyable hour was pleasantly spent in the
discussion of the good things, and just
before adjournment all joined heartily
in giving three cheers and a tiger for the
third vice president. . This parlor is one
of the most sociable and enthusiastic in
the city, and by reason of that is making
splendid progress.
The officers of Las Lomas Parlor will be
installed to-morrow night by Mrs. Emma

Sans Soud Parlor has the honor of hav
ing had the first initiation under the new
ritual, but that was before the new work
had been printed. The ftrst under the
printed ritual was by Fremont Parlor
last Friday.
Last Wednesday there was a joint In

THE admirers of grand o^era as it
was produced at the Ttvoll Bev
ernl years ago will h<*ir with
il great satisfaction that the old
time vigor and enterprise is to
be shown in the coming season,
beginning a week from to-morrow. The
management further conveys the welcome
information that iveral recognized art
ists have been engaged, and that we shall
be afforded the spice of variety in the
. matter of new faces and voices. This is
Bi it should be, and if the special stars
are what they are reported to be, we have
no doubt the result will convince the
Tivoli people that it pays to look over
the Eastern field occasionally and secure
variations of this kind. It matters little
how good the company, may be, the pub
lic will eventually lose interest and grow
weary of certain Voices and kinds of com
edy. The nianager who presents good at
tractions and avoids Inflictin* this ennui
on his patrons is the one who succeeds, as
the history of this old favorite house
proves. The public want the best that
can be had for the money, and if they
got it, crowded houses are the rule.
Theatergoers may now study the menu
card of the feast of amusement that is to
be Bet before them at the Baldwin, Co
lumbia and California for tho coming sea
son. Manager Gottlob, who has just re
turned from a long trip to the East, where
lie went to book attractions, says that he
succeeded in breaking the Frohman boy-
cott,- inaugurated against San Francisco
long ago, and that he has secured the
best things under the Frohman-Hayman
management. He further states that he
was compelled to offer "extraordinary in
ducements" to get Henry Miiler, William
Gillette and Maude Adams. That was to
he expected, but if thej maintain the
.standard of their reputations here there
will be very little risk in their engage
ment. The fact is conceded that a hi^h
cla.Â«s production will fill the Baldwin at
regular prices," and as San Franciscans
are" recognized as competent judges of ex
cellence the only question of success if
any there be, is as to the quant" of "me
art and plays to be presented. It is grat
ifying to saj that the list appears very
attractive and the advent of many of the
Productions will be awaited with gTeat in

the enterprise of the management will not
only be appreciated but handsomely re

Manager T. Daniel Frawley announces
that during the remainder of his m
pany's season, of which there will be !
eight weeks, he will limit each presenta
tion to one week's time. Notwithstand
ing this fact, he has gone to very heavy
expense for the production of "A Gallant
Surrender" at the Columbia to-morrow
night. The play was written for Mr.
Frawley by Edward E. Kidder, well
known as the author of "A Poor Rela

into prominence, as well as other works.
The new drama deals with incidents i
during the last few days of the Civil War. â¢
.There are about twenty speaking parts'
and Frawley has made some special en
gagements sq as to bring out all tliat is
beÃt even in the smallest of roles. The
production. will call for the appearance of
nearly ninety people on the stage, and I
the rehearsals under the Iti ection of Fred i

give promise of a perfect production. The
scene of the play is laid. along the James J

strong one.
Jhe Orpheum.
The management of the Orpheum have
billed four new acts, including comedy
novelties and musical turns, for this
wi i",;, which they confidently expect will
prove very attractive. Much is expected
from the Macarte Sisters, who hav<
brought from Europe for this engage
ment by the Walter Orpheum Company.
They are credited with being the greatest
In their line, and as performers on tne
high wire do some work quite different
from anything yet seen at this house.
All three are on the wire at the same
time and each performs an entirely dif
ferent line of work. Another trio from
whom a pleasing turn is expected is the
Angela Sisters, whose specialties are
songs, comic and descriptive. They are
said to be of comely appearance, of pleas
ing stage presence and fine voice. An
other musical number is the Windom
Quintet, which is composed of W. H.
Windom. he of Primrose & West fame,
and a quartet of colored boys, known as
the IMackstone Quartet. Together thia
combination make a quintet that it ia
said will rival anything that has ever
been heard at the Orpheum.
It is positively announced that Wilton
and Stack, horizontal bar artists, will ap
pear. Mr. Stack having fully recovered
from his recent accidenl. Joseph Hart and
Mis.s Carrie Ue Mar will be seen in a iiew
act entitled "Dr. Chauncey's Visit." In
this act Miss de Mar makes some very
clever character changes and in one will
wear hÂ«;r famous glass hat. The act is
said to be very funny and some ludicrous
situations are brought about by the con
fusion of names of a physician, a veter
inary surgeon, a beautiful young lady,
her niece and a pet dog. Valmore, Lo
renz, Allen and Gilbert and Goldie re
main. Matinees as usual.
Jhe Olympia.
The Olympia Music Hall for this week
has Reid, the famous barytone; Gibson
and Allen, dancers and musical come
dians; Quazina. the "Male La Loie Ful
ler"; Flossie Nash, soubrette; Ordway
and Rand, bicyclists, and others. Matinea
to-day.
The Ghutes.
The Chutes Free Theater manages to
hold its own with the downtown places of
amusement, and every afternoon and
evening large crowds are attracted to
the Haight-street grounds. The Japanese
Jugglers, acrobats, top-spinners and
magicians now appearing there are the
best of their kind seen in San Francisco
for over a decade and their balancing
and posturing feats are little short of
marvelous. Next week they will be re
tained, as will also Colby and Way, the
"Ventriloquist and the Dancing Doll,"
who enter upon their fourth and last
week with an entirely new act. The rest
of the bill will be entirely changed, and
will include Marie Casassa and her school
of educated cockatoos from Australia,
Barney Reynolds, a character comedian
and singer; Eugene Couch and Lizzia
Chester, descriptive vocalists, and Tony
Ryan, an eccentric xylophonist, renowned
as "the mad musician." Henri Maurice
Cannon has been re-engaged for a short
season. â *
The Zoo has received several additions
and a "Camera Obscura" on top of th<*
Chutes' tower promises to be a great at
traction.

OUR CANNED GOODS IN ENGLAND.
The demand for salmon during the week,

very slight, and from estimates made during
the past month the deliveries have been less
than for a considerable time back. It is evi

â with supplies from the abundant shipments of
two or three months ago. There has been an
almost entire clearance of different sorts of

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW rORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 23.â The dullness of the
etock markot wai not relieved in the closing
hours of the week, though there were one or
two Incidents to the re?t of the day's trading.
One was the buying for London account. This
â¢â at not large, but it was influential and was
pretty well distributed through the Interna
tional list. Later the lo ll traders took the
market away from th- foreigners and bid up
the prices of the Pacific railroad stocks. This
movement -row out of the consultations report
ed as having taki place itween the execu
tives of the Canadian Pacific and the Great
Northern and the rumors that the long-drawn
out dispute over transcontinental passenger
loads had been adjusted. The buying by Lon
don in the face of the downward tendency of
sterling exchange, which is already with'.n
measurable distance of the gold-importing
points, was rather unexpected. Money con
tinued easy in ndon, but it showed itself
eensltlve to demands to gold. The present eaae
In exchange Is due as yet to offerings of
grain and cotton fu:>;r but rates
ere bound to jfiel further, as X" â¢'- and cot
ton c.ime rward and the ncesaur" on London
Is likely to lead to borrowing in New York or
an Import movement of gold.
TherÂ» was a fair demand for bonds to-day,
but prices were not well held. There was a
reaction oi ?Â» to 104 in the price of the new
Government threes "when Issued."
The bark statement reflected continued .per
etior^ on account of ihe Government loan, the
decreases in cash b?lng clearly due to pay
ir.ents of subscriptions into the sub-trei
The hÂ«>avy decrease in deposits and the con
traction in loans are not so easu- accounted
lor. The loan decrease was probably due to
operations In Government bonds by banks
which have held Govennr.nt deposits, a re
duction which seems clearly indicated.
The latter part of the week witnessed a
greatly Increased demand for railroad bonds at
bdvancing prices.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. July 23. -The New Tork Ftnan
;ler fays of the 'weekly bank statement: Since
fuly 2 the clearing house banks of New York
:ity have reduced their cash reserves over
HS.OOO.GOO. In the same period, which em
braces only three weeks, they have Increased
:helr I'>ans $14. 0ne <vio and their deposits have
alien off aiv.ut $3,000,000. The cash reductions
lave been due altogether to operations with
ihe Treasury, since the movement of the ln
erior still continues. The statement there
fore in its changes shows the effectH of
financing the new loan, and as the Treasury
das received In cash for small subscriptions
-i.-aiiy or quite half the amount of the entire
oan, there seems to be no cause for further
Usturbance in the money market. The rerr.aln
ng allotments of 1100,000.000 will probably bÂ«
inanced by extending payments over a short
>eriod. Treasury deficits on one and eounter
icting the receipts from the new bonds. In
he meantime the designation of certain banks
is depositories for Government funds will
prevent the locking up of n large amount of
.â¢ash In the Treasury. Of course If all the
emainlng subscriptions were paid in one sum
h? effect might temporarily tighten the
noney market, but this Is not anticipated. The
â urrent statement shows the first decrease in
oans since the first week in May. The loss
ippears to be distributed well throughout the
Ist in Email amounts and reflects probably
iquidation of mercantile account* The mar
let for call paper at present la very inactive,
iew business being less than expiring maturl

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 23.â Continued dry weather
â tnrterl corn strong;. Nearly every commission
louse on the floor had buj-lng orders from the
country to execute at the opening, which was
rufftclent to start the prices at %@\ic ad
vance over the close â â¢r:..y. Heavy oper-
Itors, who long aÂ«o made up their minds that
*orn would meet with disaster, were consplcu
jus buyers. It was Insisted that the crop wae
already seriously damaged. All believers in
;hat state of affairs pledged their fortunes as
well as their word in support of their con
rlctlona and shorts tonK alarm and added their
iemand to that of the bulls. The market held
jtrong from beginning to end. September clos
ing with a gain of IW.C on the day.
Owing to the advance in corn and orop dam
ape reports from Dakota wheat had a bullish
Bend-off. Beptember opened at f,7>c. %c above
yesterday's closing figures. It made a further
advance to 63M>c while still under the Influence
r>f the boom in corn, but parted company with
the latter at the point last referred to. The
tendency after â  that was reluctantly down
ward Indications of a much freer movement
of new wheat the coming week had most to
do with the heavier feeling that supervened-
September, after a decline to CS%?iSS%c, oneÂ«
more became firm on the Ht ill more bullish
tone of corn the last half hour of the cession.
July, however, was evidently struck with fenr
of the (Trowing movement of new wheat, for
after bringing" 7SHc early in the day It fell
to 76V-C at the clone. A Liverpool cablegram
reported the Roumanian crop damaged 20 j"r
cent but another cablegram gave an excellent
account of that crop. September gained KÂ«%e
and December advanced H@VÂ£c in trie day.
Owing to the unfavorable threshing reports
and the firmness of corn oats scored a good
advance, leaving off %Â®Vtc up.
Higher prices for hogs and the rise In corn
strengthened provisions. Pork is 12% c higher,
lard 5(0 7%c lower and ribs lower.

DRIED FRUITS. NUTS. R*IEINS. ETC.
Prunes are meeting with an improved de
mand in New York, as will be seen by the fol
lowing extract from the Commercial:
"California Prunes are exciting some Inter- j
est, owing to a larger demand for medium j
sizes for outside hotel and boarding-house 1
trade. The berry season Is passing, in some
sections is entirely over, and an increase in j
demand for Prunes always follows. As a con- 1
sequence of the slightly enlarged Inquiry there I
Is a firmer feeling among jobbers and more j
Inquiry for supplies. Just what the result may ]
be Is yet uncertain, but It is understood that |
supplies are practically exhausted, and there
bids fair to be a slight advance under pres
sure of increased demand."
In the local market buyers are steadily ad
vancing their bids fur new Prunes, but with- j
out effect, as holders and growers are not
selling. Current bids are 3V4(f3% for the four
sizes.
Peaches are showing more life and are
wanted. The largest local holding In the city
was closed out yesterday.
New Apricots are briskly Inquired after by |
buyers, but Ik Iders are not disposed to meet !
them, believing that prices will go still higher.

The circular of .Tacob Wollner says: "Our.
wool market is still In a very quiet position, |
only the very choice wools are In demand and
looked for. Prices remain about the same.
For heavy, defective or scoured wool there Is
no demand except by a few local mills. The
wool market in the principal Eastern seaboard
centers continues unchanged and prices are be
ing maintained with wonderful firmness con
sidering the very quiet demand, but this pecu
liar condition has been a feature of the trade
for a long period and Is lareely ba*Â»d upon the
future outlook and the strength displayed by
the Western owners of the new clip of wool. |
Dealers cannot replace their stock at the prices I
offered by the mills, and most lines of foreign !
Â«â '.:â  are far below the importing point. It'
promises to be a dull market until well along j
In August or September. The Bale of wool in i
the Boston markets alone 13 130,000,000 pounds ,
1-ss this year than last and 60,000.000 pounds
le?s th".n In lSStj!, which was a normal year. 1
The arrival of 13,000,000 of domestic and 000.- i
000 foreign less than last year makes the situ- I

Harrison's circular Bays: "During the week
there have been the following deliveries of
coal: from Washington five cargoes with 13,
390 tonp, two from British. Columbia 5450 tons,
one from Oregon 160 tons, two from Australia
E9S4 tons, one from Baltimore 2464 tons; total,
27,448 tons. There are yet several transport
cteamers to be coaled, which will leave here
before August 1; these will serve to reduce
our stocks-Bomcwhat,' but after that time our
calls for the Government will be compara
tively light. Contracts for over 60,000 tons for
delivery at Honolulu for the Navy Depart
ment are now being filled; none i>f this coal
Is being shipped from here, . the principal por
tion goes from Australia and British Colum
bia. â  A few cargoes from Australia have been
ordered to Manila direct for the Government.
There Is no change of values; the market is
â¢steady, as the amount of fuel being delivered
Is fully equal to the amount consumed. Coast
freights are firm, caused by the retiring of
most of our steam colliers for transports; thÂ«
latest Quoted coal freights from Australia
show a decline. The Btrlke nt the Welsh col
lieries is oecoming very serious, the more so
as a compromise appears unlikely for the mo
ment. The employers and employees met a
few days ago, from which no settlement em
anated. There are still intimations of friction
in Australia, which may develop into a gen
eral strike." -

THE AFRIDI A3 A FIGHTER.
The Times of India, in reviewing the
present situation on the frontier, deals
with the value of the Afridl as a fight
ing man. It says: 'Much has been
said about the Afridi, and we have al
ways been led to believe that he is the
finest fighting material that the fron
tier produces. Since the operations at
thp close of last year, we think that
this opinion has undergone somewhat
of a change, and most men who took
part in the campaign into Tirah have
not the same opinion with which they
started as to the worth of the Afridl
as a fighting man. That he has a won
derful eye to a country, and is a mag
nificent shot, cannot be denied,' but it
is doubtful if he has the sterling fight
ing qualities of the Sikh for instance,
even when well led; indifferently led he
certainly has not. He is wanting in
that dash and stolid indifference to
harm which makes the reliable fight
ing man. The Tirah campaign has, I
think I can safely say, found the Afridi
much more deficient in dash than the
Swati and Bajourl men, infinitely
worse armed and considered Infinitely
less warlike. Of course the argument
may be used that It is a soldierly qual
ity to do as much damage as you can
at a minimum of risk to oneself. That
is so, and in the harassing tactics the
Afridis scored heavily, but they were
absolutely wanting in that dash which
would have, if successful, had decided
results. They harassed all they knew,
but the united effect was small, where
as if they had had sufficient heart they
could have made a bid for the annihi
lation of many detached portions of the
invading force."

BINNIE AND NED IN CUBA.
rIERB was a sharp rattling of
rifles. Bullets sang shrilly as they
tore their way through the
bushes and glanced among the
rocks that studded the Cuban
mesa. A file of soldiers wearing the
Spanish uniform led by a swarthy of
ficer came forward on a brisk run, al
most before the echoes that their rifles
had caused had died away. They for
eook the dusty highway upon which
they had been Btanding when they
fired and having spread out in a thin
line began to look for the man whom
they had shot. On the twigs that had
been broken down by the object of their
marksmanship as he had turned to tlee
were red dropsâ fresh blood. So then
the riflemen had proved their reputa
tion to being dead shots for a certainty.
But where was he. their victim?
Close to the highway the w
thin. A little back the underbrush was
dense. Briars formed what would Beem
to be an impenetrable fa yond
this hedge the bank sloped steeply down
to the edge of a mountain sti
The riflemen had keen eyes and it did
not take them long to rind the place
where the fugitive had broken through
the thorny hedge. The briars were
adorned b; Mue '-loth and
er? sprinkled with blood. But. try as
hard as they could, none of the Spanish
soldiers could pass through the hole in
"Forward!" shouted their captain
fiercely. "Forward, men! Are you go
ing to stand here all day and let the
rascal escape us? You. Antone and
Quesada, stay here and watch, for th-Â±
Yankee may be still in hiding. If he
a his head be sure that there is
one Yankee less in Cuba to-night. The
if you come with me. Forward."
Antone and Quesada. two young
Spanish soldiers, at once examined their
rifles. "Have no fear of us, good cap
tain." said Quesada, as he grinned
savagely and showed a row of white
teeth of which he was particularly
proud. "The Yankee, let him show his
head here for an instant. will be a quick
traveler to that place where all the
Vankt-es will soon be if I have my full
will."
ThÂ« and his other followers
I from view, and soon the
sentries heard them crashing
through the woods on the other side of
and shouting angrily. ThÂ»n
there was the sound of a pistol shot and
then another in quick succession. Que
sada fell prone upon his face at the
rt and then Antone, when the
rang the second time, threw up
. mds, spun around in his tracks
and dropped amonÂ°- the bushes. Neither
iead, but both were badly hurt.
From a tree nearly over their heads
dropped a spare, slim figure dressed in
a blue suit. On the head of this per
son, who was the one who had fired
the shots that had laid the sentries
low, was a broad sombrero. Such a
face! The eyes were gray and fear
less, and had withal an expression of
good sense. The sombrero, thrown
partly back, showed a broad and high
forehead, which was smooth and indi
cated very young manhood. Around
the ample brow clustered a mass of
curling hair, dark brown in color. The
mouth was large and firm, but had a
queer little curl at the corners, hinting
that its daring owner possessed a share
of reckless fun, and regarded all things
from the standpoint of a laughing phil
osopher. The nose was straight and
finely molded. The ears were small.
Altogether this was a fine looking
young man, for while his figure was
spare. It was finely knit and unques
tionably athletic.
"I had to do it or be killed myself,"
said the young man. "There was no
other way to save my own life, for
these sentries would have had no more
pity for me than they would for a wild
beast had they ever happened to see
me. Not that I am looking much for
pity. Ah, what have we hei
Something that sparkled in the after
noon sun caught the glance of the
brave young fellow. He bent over and
seized the glittering object.
"Ah," said he with a sudden start
and a look of pain, "it is the lovely
Donna Julia. Let me open the locket."
From a niche under Donna Julia's pic
ture fluttered out a piece of paper
upon which something was written.
This was quickly seized. The next in
stant the two sentries were left alone.
The bushes were moved slightly and
then all was silence. But now the
Spanish captain and his followers came
once more upon the scene. The Span
iards were intent upon finding out who
had fired the shots of which they had
heard the reports. Two shots meant
to them that both sentries had fired,
and they returned, expecting that they
THE BUMPKINS SET ABOUT BUILDING THEMSELVES A SNAKE PROOF PHILIPPINE HOUSE FOR THEIR HEADQUARTERS.
would find the Yankee whom they
sought, and that he would have been
shot by both of the sentries. But when
they saw their wounded sentries their
rage was overpowering.
Ramon, the captain's lieutenant, went
to Quesada and raised his head and
then went to the prostrate form of An
"My comrades," he said, "who
can have done this?"
The Spanish captain was fierce for
the d- . of the mysterious Yan
kee. He shrewdly guessed that the
Yankee had doubled upon his tracks
and had come back through the thicket
while a search was making for him
on the other side. This was the truth,
but the captain had guessed the solu
tion of the riddle too late. The Span
ish bullets had come uncomfortably
close to the American. One had grazed
his right shoulder, and it was his blood
that had stained the pathway In the
woods. He had worked his way
through the hole in the hedge and then,
knowing all the secrets of woodcraft
anJ Indian tricks, he had kept perfect
ly still while the voices of his pursuers
died away in the distance and only tho
Bentrles, who were uttering their
boasts, remained.
Noiselessly, with skill that an Indian
might well have envied, he worked his
way backward, on his stomach, until
he came to a tree with a trunk suf
ficiently large to hide his body. A few
seconds more found him in the tree,
and in such a position that he could.
he sentries plainly, and no branch
or twig was in the way of a perfect
aim. With as much deliberation as
it" there had not been an enemy within
a hundred miles, he examined his pis
tols carefully. He replaced one pis
tol in his belt, and then, with his fn
vorite firearm, took careful aim and
fired twice. It was quite character
istic of him that he did not look to see
whether the first bullet had found an
enemy. He had never missed an aim
in his life.
Now, when so much. In fact, his life.
and a mission that he held very much
dearer than his life, were at stake, his
B were a? steady as if be hail been
made of marble. He was on the ground
almost as soon as he had pulled the
trigger the second time. Then, hav
ing done what has been already de
â  <1. he once more crawled into the
hedge and waited. As soon as the
sh captain and his posse had re
turned to the sentries he emerged from
the thicket on the other side and sped
like an antelope along what would have
seemed no trail to an eye less prac
ti< <d. But he never paused and never
was at fault. Long before the cap
tain had tried to retrieve his mistake
the American was miles distant, and
there was no human being who could
have followed his footsteps, as he took
pains to repeatedly cross and recross
his tracks. Then he broke the scent
by swinging along from limb to limb
iw, overhanging trees. Just as
the sun was setting he found himself
upon the top of a high hill, and in the
heart of a seemingly untrodden wilder
ness. But that savage place had
yielded up all its secrets to the intrepid
lad. He paused a minute and then
uttered a low cry. in imitation of a
mocking bird's whistle.
He waited a minute and listened, and
then repeated the signal. A similar
call was heard. . The next instant a
young boy, whose features marked him
unmistakably as an American, came
into view.
"Well. Binnie," said the second Amer
ican to appear in the story, "what
brings you here? I supposed that you
were already many miles upon your
way."
"I made a good start certainly," said
the one who was addressed as Binnip,
"but a file of Spanish soldiers were in
the way and they narrowly let me es
cape them. I think, from the indica
tions of this day, that it is about time
for us to move, for the Spanish soldiers
did not happen along in this unfre
quented part of Cuba merely by chance.
Home one must have made it a point to
tell the Spanish commander that possi
bly he might find something to interest
him if he would come up here."
"But you have b^en shot, Binnie,"
said the other, noticing his bloody
sleeve for the first time.
"Yes, Ned, the soldiers nearly made
me a non-combata-nt. You know what
that means in Cuba if I had fallen into
the hands of Blanco's men. But I am
not hurt badly, only a flesh wound.
And that does not trouble me much.
Just a day or two of rest while we are
planning and you are reconnoitering
and with the application of some of
your simples I will be as good aa new
once more."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JL T LY 24, 1898.
EDITED BY
DAVID H. WALKER
The two Americans, while they were
eating their simple evening: meal, not
darin"- to make a fire for fear the smoke
would reveal their hiding place to the
Spaniards, who would be sure to fol
low the trail if they had the slightest
indication to guide them, discussed the
events of the day and both were of
opinion that the chances of success in
the enterprise in which they had on
gaged would be better if they should
seek some other place of hiding for the
present.
As they sit talking we may make a
close study of them. Binnie has re
moved his hat and his extreme youth ia
made plainer than when we first saw
him in the forest. He do.-s not look now
to be older than 17, and that, in point
of fact, is his real age. His comrade
Is as young. He is more heavily built
than Binnie, but he is fully as tall,
about 5 feet and 10 inches. He has
blue eyes and light ilaxen hair. H.s
mouth, like Binnie's. marks him for a
determined spirit and for great courage.
The light of irrepressible fun dam
his eyes as FSinnie tells how cleverly he
outwitted the Spanish captain.
"The mysterious paper that you
found in the locket," said Ned, "let us
look at that."
The writing was in Spanish. That
would not have hindered the knowledge
of ite contents from dawning upon the
searchers for the key of the mystery
had it not been written in a cipher.
I^mg the lads pondered over the writ
ing, and many ways they adopted to
solve its riddle, but all in vain. Their
curiosity was increased by the signa
ture of Blanco at the bottom. Had
they in their possession a message in
trusted to a spy? The fact that thÂ»*
soldier from whom it had been taken
was dressed in the uniform of a Span
ish soldier and that he had been st-rv
ing as a private did not interfere with
this supposition.
Late at night the lad? sought slum
ber, but the cipher message troubled
the sleep of both.
"Wake up, Ned," said Binnie, "I
hay.' the key."
Ned "j't-ned his eyes and found Bin
nie with the mysterious paper in his
hands.
"It is so simple. Ned, that we must
have been stupid not to see it at once.
"And what does It say, Binnie?
"Here it is:"
To all trusty Spaniards to whom this
may come, greeting. The bearer is â¢ n
trusted with the task of seizing and
bringing to me Donna Julia Velasquez
: ughter of the Â« hiban dog, I
Velasquez, who has stored in some
â  arms and ammunition, the !â 
of which is known to Donna Julii alone
Permit the bearer freely to pass and with
out question. BLANCO.
"And so themanf-rom whom you took
this writing was to carry away Donna
Julia?"
"So it soems."
"How did he come by her locket?"
"That we will learn soon, I hope."
"To-morrow?"
"Yes, to-morrow."
The boys once more slept and were
not roused again until daylight. They
at once ate their breakfast and planned
their day of work and adventure.

MARGARET'S DOLL HOUSE.
BY ESTELLE BAKER.
MARGARET wanted a doll's
house â "a real, truly doll's
house" â with the walls all pa
pered and carpets on the floor,
just as it was in her little room.
Margaret ;s a little California girl and
she is s years dd. She has sweet brown
eyes, a. winsome face and long, brown
curls.
Her parents are not poor, but never
theless they are not rich enough to buy
her a doll's house like those they sell
in the toy stores. So her brother, Will,
told her he would make her one. Will
is just 1") and he is a real good brother,
as you will soon see.
One Friday afternoon when Will got
home from school Margaret asked him
if he would next day build hei a doll's
house and he said "Yes," if she would
find him a bis^ box. Bo Margaret went
next door to Mrs. Davis and asked for
one. Mrs. Davis had promised her one
and so she gave here a great box in
which she had packed some things
when she came from New York. It
was so big that Margaret could lie
down in it and still have plenty of
; in which to kick about.
Then she got Eddie Davis and Charlie
ards to drag the big box over to
her hous^. They put the little Davis
baby Lucille Into it and pulled her over
to Margaret's bouse. She laughed and
crowed while having her ride In the
box.
Then, the next morning, when Mar
garet awoke she found that Will had
gone into the back yard and was mak
ing the doll's house.
She slipped her clothes on just as
quick as she could and ran out to Bee
how he was getting on. He had pro
cured some wall paper from some in
cured some wall paper from the
cellar and in the farther end of
had turned the box on its side and then
nailed some redwood blocks .1
until the box was divided into three
parts, kitchen, parlor and bedroom. He
had palnrled ihe kitchen floor red, and
stretched a piece of rag tightly from
one end of the dining room to the other
â¢ and made it a carpet.
Th"?i he cut the wall paper into
pieces to fit the walls and ceiling and
pasted tlv.m on. Then he took his
saw and cut a square hole in the back
room for a window.
Margaret wondered what she wou)d
do f"r furniti^re. So he pave her oO
cents to buy some at the candy store,
where she could get paper furniture
filled with candy. The parlor set was
of paper and cost her 10 cents. The
remainder of the money was spent In
buying things for the kitchen.
When Margaret brought them home
"Will helped her cut the furniture out
and place It in the rooms. Then Will
got ?i few pieces of muslin fmm his
mother and cut them into squat
thai they were window curtains.
Then the house was finished and Mar
garet placed her dolls in it. Mamma is
soon going to get her a li tie piano for
the parlor and papa thinks the doll
house is just too cute for anything.
FAIRIES IN THE DELL
BY RUTH EMILY CROCKER.
The flowers grow in little beds
Within this mossy glade;
The violets droop their modest heads,
The rose is here arrayed.
'Tis pretty in this dainty place,
Scene of the fairies' ballâ
Tne Ladles dressed in silks and lace
And they are sweet and tall.
The men are dressed in purple velvet
Made by fairies' hands
Th..-ir huts are in the latest style
And have black ribbon bands.
Their supper Is of honey dew
And berries ripe and sweet
They eat and then they dance again
With tiny, tripping feet.
Oh, fairies, dainty, shy and young;
In s-ecret do you dance.
.Why don't you let us see you? Oh!
We long to get one glance.
The reason must be you're so shy
And much afraid of us,
But now I will be going, so
I will not stop to fuss.
The Troy Times tells of a little girl
who had been naughty. When bedtime
c;;;nc her mother said to her: "Now,
Mabel, when you your prayers, be
sure to ask God to help you not to be a
naughty little girl." Mabel promised
that ph-' would aud this petition to her
r-riyers; so when she had finished her
usual form she spoke as follows: "And
now, God, please keen Mabel from be
ing a naughty little girl." There was a
pause, then she concluded: "Never
theless, thy will, not mine, be done!"

THE IMPRISONED DOLLY.
BY CHARLES A. KEELER.
I've a deir little dolly-
Shut up in a book,
"Who's always BO jolly
Whenever I look
That mamma has told me
If r<! be bo gay
She never would scold me
Or send me away.
It must be so dreary
Between the dark leaves;
I'm sure she gets weary
And laugha in her sleeves!
Altho' ii is folly,
I'll tear out the page
And let my dear dolly
Step out of her cage.
THE CELEBRATION.
BY ALMA S. BEMENDERFER OF ANGELS CAMP.
THE Rollins farm, on which Sam
and Jake lived with their parents,
is situated in the Sacramento Val
ley, far from any large town. As
the boys had few friends they
hailed with delight their cousin, Jim
Hobson, who came from San Francisco.
He had expected to visit them on the
Fourth of July, but was sick, and so
did not arrive until some days later.
In the meantime the news had come
that the Spaniards had surrendered at
Santiago de Cuba, and so Jim brought
along his fireworks, which he had not
been able to use on the Fourth, his
purpose being to celebrate the surren
der of Santiago. The fireworks were
packed in a plain wooden box, on
which, for fun, he marked in large let
ters, "Dynamite â Please Handle With
Care," an order the trainmen obeyed
to the letter.
His trip was so pleasant he was al
most sorry when the cars stopped at
the station, where he was met by
Sam and Jake with a large farm wag
on. They were surprised when they
learned what the box contained. On
the way home Jake remarked: "I say,
Tom, what do you suppose father will
say about those fireworks? We were
forbidden to buy any, for since the
Rogers sheep range burned over he is
very careful."
"Nonsense," laughed Tom. "Why I
intend to set them off on the river
away down on the swamp. He could
not say no to that any how, for that
is a safe place; and, for my part, I
don't see the use of telling him about
it. We are old enough to manage a
little fun like that without burning any
one out. Sam, you are 15, Jake is 13
and lam 16. Just put the box in the
barn, or any place. It will not spoil
till we celebrate."
All doubts were swept away by this
argument, and on reaching home the
box was hid in the barn under the hay.
That evening, while sitting on the
porch, Sam pointed to a little cabin
a half mile away, but in plain sight
from where they were. "See that place,
fellows? Well, the queerest old chap
lives there; a regular old curio. I am
going to take you up and show him to
you some day. He has planted all
sorts of thing's, and not enough of any
one kind to make it pay. His clothes
are always patched. Ouess he does it
himself, and the way he putters around
and tries to irrigate with that old
windmill makes me laugh. He has
been here three months; bought eighty
acres of land. That plowed around
to one side of the cabin is his."
"Boys," paid Tom suddenly, "would it
not be a splendid joke as we are going
to the river to give him a taste of the
fun just on the plowed ground.
We could not hurt anything there, and
to see him poke his head out of that
window to see what is going on would
be more fun than a picnic."
They all laughed at the mere idea.
"Now," remarked Sam, "all we need
to do is to arrange the contents of that
box in a basket. Those we will need
first on top.
This was soon done, the mischievous
boys selecting giant fire crackers, as
they could be arranged on a long fuse
and set oft" with dispatch. After dark
the boys crept along by the timber,
which threw weird shadows over the
cabin and plowed ground. With care
a long line of fuse and fire crackers was
laid by the cabin.
"Hand me that punk," whispered
Tom, as he felt around the basket
hunting for the end of the fuse. But
he never found it. As Sam was about
to do as directed some sparks from the
end of the punk fell into the basket.
In an instant the whole place was lit
up. Roman candles, blue lights, sky
rockets, fire crackers, pin wheels,
bombs, etc., were discharged in all di
rections and the fields were raked over
as if there was a battle. The fire crack
ers going off every second and the blue
lights and smoke giving the scene a
weird, grotesque appearance. The boys
were taken by surprise and, very much
singed and powder-burned, they tried
to put out the small fires started in the
Stubble and short grass, running to
the pump for water and trying to beat
them out with wet sacks. They had
nearly succeeded till it got into the tall
grass and was fanned up by a steady
breeze toward the house and buildings.
The boys heard some one shout, and
looking around saw the old man run
ning toward them. In a short time by
his help the fire was extinguished, but
not before it had cleared the grass from
five acres of pasture land, and been the
means of stampeding some horses in an
adjoining field, who broke through the
fencing out into the road, where they
were soon lost to sight. When all
danger was passed the boys and the
old man went into the house dining
room to get supper and talk it over.
He proved very agreeable, and told
them something of his history, and
they wondered why they ever thought
of making sport of him. It seems he
was an old soldier, and he was making
the place a home for his daughter-in
law and grand-children, for his son
had enlisted to go to Manila.
"And this boy," he said, patting Tom
on the back, "will make a famous sol
dier. He worked like one to put out
that fire, and doesn't seem to mind
burns like some boys."
This praise made Tom feel rather
cheap. But he went on to say, as he
had been to town, he did not see the
fire till he came in sight of the boys
back firing. At this news the boys felt
more at their ease, for they argued he
did not see the celebration. But next
day, while out hunting for the stray
horses, they saw some one who did, a
woodchopper, who lived near the
swamp, but he promised not to tell
their secret.
WE SAID GOOD-BYE
BY CHARLES ELMER UPTON,
PLACERVILLE.
We said good-bye, the fleeting hour*
Have into fortnights grown,
Fair are earth and sky to-day,
Tet my heart is lone.
Yearning for the little folk
Now so far from me,
Longing for the dear old homa
I no longer see.
God grant throughout life's journeylnf
Those tender feet may know
The paths of love and innocence.
That ever upward go.
And surely, when eternal dawn
Illumes the fading sky,
Soul will answer unto soul
Where nono shall say good-bye.
BUMPKINS AND RABBITS.
ALL. the children will see this
morning how hard their good
friend Bronstrup has been work
ing during the past -week to
truthfully picture the new sur
roundings of the Bumpkins who are
on one of the Philippine islands. They
did not reach Manila, as they hoped,
but arrived at an Island which has the
jawcracking name of Tolehtfotseinnuf,
so called by a native chief who had
learned to spell backward when he was
young, and who was the jolliest canni
bal then alive. His songs were so side
splitting that the missionaries called
him Old Tickleriba. He got even with
them at dinner time and left to his chil
dren a soap box full of hymn books,
for which the missionaries had no
further use.
The failure of the Bumpkins to find
Manila explains the lack of Manila rope
to tie the Bumpkin house together with.
But, never mind, there are snakes and
Bronstrup shows how these can be
used. Three rabbits, who are tired of
war, are pictured to-day. Two of them
have fallen in love and Bonnie ia
amused at their attentions. We will
hear more from this trio.
Mamma â Never say you can't
There's no such word as can't.
Tommyâ There always seems to be
such word when I ask If I can have
more jelly.
THE BOY LEFT ALONE.
BY JEAN BLEWETT.
It's the lonesofnest house you ever
BE W,
This big gray house where I stay â
I don't call it living at all. at ail-
Since .my mother went away.
Four long weeks ago, and it seems a
ybar;
"Gone home," so the preacher said.
An' I ache in my breast with want
ing her,
An' my eyes are always red.
I stay out of doors till I'm almost
froze,
'Cause every corner and room
Seems empty enough to frighten a
boy,
And filled to the doors with gloom.
I hate them to call me to my meals.
Sometimes I think I can't bear
To swallow a mouthful of anything,
An' her not sitting up there,
A-pourin' the tea an' passin" it
An' laughin' to see me take
Two big lumps of sugar instead of
one,
An' more than my share of cake.
I'm too big to be kissed, I used to
say.
But somehow I don't feel right.
Crawling into bed as still as a
mouse â
Nobody saying good night,
An' tucking the clothes up under my
chin,
An' pushing my hair back, so;
Thingg a boy makes fun of before
his chums.
But things that he likes, you know.
Thorp's no one to go to when things
go wrong â
She was always so safe and sure;
Why. not a trouble could tackle a
boy
That she couldn't up and cure.
There are lots of women, it seems to
me.
That wouldn't be missed so much-
Women whose boys are about all
grown up.
An' old maid aunties, an' such.
I can't make it out for the life of me
Why she should have to go,
An' her boy left here in this old gray
house,
A-needing an' wanting her 30.
I tell you the very lonesomest thing
In this great big world to-day
Is a big boy of ten whose heart is
broke
'Cause his mother is gone away.

HANDLING SHIPS
BEFORE SANTIAGO.
Continued from Page Twenty-four.
boats, mostly of the "improvised" clajss.
Immediate preparations were made for
disembarking the troops. Baiquiri, a
little town with a good harbor, afout
ten miles east of Santiago, was se
lected as the landing place. The town
is defended by two or three batteries,
which it was, of course, necessary to
reduce before the army could land.
General Shafter and Admiral Sampson
decided upon the 22d instant as the day
of disembarkation, and, on the even
ing of the 21at, the admiral issued or
ders for a general bombardment of all
the batteries along the coast, from
Santiago to Baiquiri, on the following
morning.
It may seem somewhat strange to
you that these same batteries need to
be repeatedly bombarded. The reason
Is this: The enemy's guns, with the
exception of those of the Cabanas and
Morro forts, are mounted either behind
extensive earthworks, or on the crest
of a high bluff, so that they just "peep"
over the top. It is a comparatively
easy matter to drive the Spaniards
away from their guns, and thus si
lence the batteries temporarily; but in
order to permanently reduce them it
would be necessary to nit each indi
vidual gun. and this, under the circum-
M;iu<-f.-;, is exceedinglj difficult, even
with the best of marksmanship.
Th â¢ best we have boon able to do is
to drive the Spaniards away from their
batteries temporarily. occasionally
knocking out a gun with a lucky shot.
The general bombardment began
about 7 o'clock yesterday morning (the
22<i) and lasted a couple of hours.
The Scorpion, New Orleans, and four
or five other vessels engaged the ba
teries at Baiquiri, where the troops
were to land. Other vessels were as
signed to each of the batteries along
the coast from that point to Santiago.
We ran In to within LOO yards of the
shore at Baiquiri and opened such a
rapid fire that the Spaniards ceased
firing and deserted their guns inside
or half an hour. We kept up our fusil
lade, however, for a couple of hours,
meanwhile the transports came up be
hind us and prepared to land troops.
The soldiers were full of enthusiasn
eager to land, and could hardly be
kept back until we had cleared the
beach with our -uns. At everj par
ticularly g:o-.>d shot from the ships, they
cheered tis wildly.
Though they were supposed to wait
until the bombardment was over b<
fore landing, the troops came up close
behind us in their boats while the fir
Ing was at its hottest, and long before
it h:. ceased they had begun to land.
My personal station was on the bridg
of the Scorpion, and during the latte
part of the engagement, I had to give
as much attention to keeping the sol
diers out of our line of lire, as I die
to the training of our g-uriÃ.
An amusing incident occurred whil
the bombardment was still in proTPss
The Twenty-fifth Infantry (colored)
came by in their boats on their way to
the shore, and a.s they -assed us a
band on one of the ships struck up
"All Coons L<>. k Alike to Me," follow
ed by "Ther'il be a Hot Time in the Old
Town To-Night." The Bhout of laugh
ter that went up could be heard above
the roar of the guns. The darkii ap
preciated the joke, too, cheered the
ships, and called out to us "Clear th
way, boys, and we'll do the rest "
So far as I have heard the onl'v cas
ualties on our Bide occurred on the
battle-ship Texas, which hud one man
killed and eight wounded. June 85 \\>

i order before our troops, after about
liaLf an hour's firing.
The climate here is terribly hot, and
the general says he is pushing on to
ward Santiago with all possible dis
| patch, in the hope of capturing the
place and getting the troops under
shelter of the houses of the town be
fore they become debilitated by the cli
mate and sickness breaks out.
1 think by July 4, if not before. San
tiago will be ours. It is said the town
ie garrisoned by 12.000 Spanish troops.
In addition to these, the Spanish Ad
miral Cervera's squadron is In the har
bor, consisting of the armored cruisers
Vizcaya Oquendo and Colon, the
cruiser Ueina Mercedes, the torpedo
boat Terror and another torpedo ves
sel, whose name Is not known to us.
Of course, simultaneous with the land
attack, we will bombard the forts. The j
Cuban forces are co-operating with our i
army. Five hundred Cubans from
General Rabl's command at Aserra
dero, eighteed miles west of Santiago,
were transported by our vessels to a
point where they could join our forces.
These troops, together with about 500 i
more, are now with the army, acting
as guides and skirmishers. General
Garcia, the Cuban commander-in-chief
of the eastern part of Cuba with a
force of about 3000 men. is on his way
to Santiago, and should be able to
form a Junction with our troops to-day
or to-morrow.
Santiago is Bure to be ours, probably
before this reaches you; but In this
fearful climate I f^ar it will cost us
dear. â¢
Luckily the ra'.ny seopon Is over, the
most unhealthy part of the year: but
the days- are frightfully hot, and the
nights not very much better, and un
less the army can set tv their work
promptly and capture the place, sick
ness will soon break out among the
troops.
The horrors of real war were vividly
brought home to me to-day. When I
saw them carrying in the dead and
wounded BOldiers, The navy part of
this job is hard enough, calling for
â¢leas vigilance night and day: but
our work is Infinitely easier than thai
of the army. Besides, the navy is
toue;h an '. used to all kinds of climates,
and knows how to take care of itself.
Half of our men nn board ship stand
at their loaded puns throughout the
nifrtit, while the other half sleep along
side of them. We can open fire in ten
Is. Officers HTid men are all hay- !
Inp a tough time of it. Yel ouÂ» Bani
tary regulations are so perfect that!
there Is little sickness in the fleet In
spite of the terrific heat. We have a
hospital Bhir fitted up with all the
comforts possible in such a climate, to
which every man who becomes ill is
promptly Bent. The army has one also;
and besides these Clara Barton Is
