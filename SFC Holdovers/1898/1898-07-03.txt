PLAYA DEL ESTE, July 2-
Generals Lawton and Chaffee saved
the day. The artillery was cannon
ading Santiago at noon and the
chances are good for celebrating the
Fourth of July in the city. A thou
sand Spaniards were killed and 500
were taken prisoners.
Cavalry gallantly pressed forward
to the right and left. Before the
afternoon was far gone) these or
ganizations made one grand rush
all along the line, carrying the
Spaniards off their feet, captur
ing San Juan's fortifications and
sending the enemy in mad haste
off toward Santiago.
It was but 3 o'clock when these
troops were able to send word to
General Shafter they had taken
possession of the important posi
tion he had given them that clay
to capture. In this- attack the
cavalrymen were supported by
the Sixth and Sixteenth Infantry,

The advance was up the last
steep slope through the heavy
underbrush. Our men were sub
jected to a terrific fire from the
enemy's trenches and the Rough

fered severely. There was no ar
tillery to support the attack. The

charge of Sergeant Hallett Alsop

PRISONERS TAKEN
IN FRIDAY'S FIGHT
General Shafter Expected to Capture
Santiago Before Sundown on
Saturday.
SIBONEY, July l.vla Juragua, by the Associated Press pispatch Boat Cynthia, via Port Antonio and
Kingston, July 2. â At 6:30 Friday evening General Shafter- said to the Associated. Press correspondent at his
headquarters: . ... â¢â¢..." 'â¢ â 
"We have Caney in our possession and the whole crest of the plateau at Caney. We have taken some 2000
prisoners on this side of Santiago. General Lawton is moving to the. left to join the â nith General Wheel
er. The Spaniards have been driven back into the city and to-morrow we will take and enter it."
This statement was fully confirmed by what the correspondent had seen' half -an hour before from Cap
tain Grimes' artillery position, which was still the best point of vantage from which to survey the field.
At sundown, as the correspondent stood on the summit, behind the cannon that had done such gallant
execution during the day, our infantry in possession of the blockhouse opposite our original center were yet
persistently and cheerfully popping away at the Span' ards who were skulking behind the lesser intrench
ments and the refugees between them and the city. .*. . ' â¢'
It a â eared when darkness came that not ''naniard would- be found outside the city proper in that par
ticular vicinity. Most noticeable was the lack of air- responsive fire from, the Spaniards, a further evidence,
added to that of the afternoon, that their ammunition was greatly reduced.
At this time, all the firing has ceased on the rittht of our position and General Lawton's artillery ia al
ready moving past Caney. ..."
On the right General Lawton's
division, supported by Colonel
Van Home's brigade, drove the
enemy from in front of Caney,
forcing them back into the vil
lage. There the Spaniards for a
time were able to hold their own,
but early in the afternoon the
American troops stormed the vil
lage defenses, driving the enemy
out and taking possession of the
place. Gaining a direct road into
Santiago, they established their
line's within three-quarters of a
mile of the city at sunset.
While the battle was raging
about Caney, Cuban scouts

outer defenses Santiago was begun
from the. sea. and land at 7 o'clock this
morning., The forts at Caney were de
stroyed and the/ victory -won after hard
fighting at San Juan. ;. : " ..,-"; ..
We. who. were last night near the
rear, were, .ordered to .move at half- :
past ,?.. o'clock- this â¢ morning, and then
learned with keen satisfaction that the
main attack was to be begun by the
Sixth and.. Seventy-first, with the Six
teenth in reserve. -.Before the dawn
the narrow road, a foot deep in mire,
was crowded with; marching men. â¢ An
attempt had .been made to improve the
: road by .throwing branches of trees: in
it, but thatt made matters worse. The
men formed in lines on both sides, the
Seventy-first joining the general
sweeping movement toward Santiago.. '
A rtiile froth . the Seventy-first's old
camp we found a winding stream with
{ no bridge and had to ford it. The sul
â¢ try heat after the night chill made all
: eager to. bathe and drink as we waded
through/- Twenty minutes before 7
o'clock- 1 heard' the low rumble of guns
'. ahead .as if from cannon fired from a
. hill across. the. valley. Caprpn's battery,
had ; opened oh Caney. ".,.â .â¢â¢' â :.' "
\ At ten minutes to 7 the Seventy-first
.. halted, for rest â¢ and â â¢ I pushed on
through â¢ the '- 4000 " Cubans under j Gen-;
eral Castillo and by General Shatter's
-headquarters, where the general rest- c
ed on a cot, awaiting reports, under
â  the shade of the leaves of the wood.
â¢ I ran down the line. Lawton's men
were .eking -Caney.- The Cubans
â¢.turned off â¢atâ¢ El Pozo Hill, following
the main road to the right, moving into
position to the northeastward "of â¢' the
city. At El Pozo is a creek, a large
stone wall and a very steep hill up
which is a difficult path. On top of the
hill is a brick works and there, too,
fronting to the westward, was a bat
tery of three field guns in position, and
on a higher hill to the right due north
were Capron's battery and infantry.
Caney is a suburb of Santiago and
two miles from the city. In it was a
regiment of infantry and a strong
blockhouse of ornamenta. finish. It is
the most important place near the capi
tal. As I reached the summit of El
Pozo smoke belched from one of.
Capron's guns to the north of us, and
the blockhouse was hidden by a cloud
of dust and stones and seemed to tum
ble to its base.
â  The rattle of infantry fire reached us
then and the battery fired gun after
gun In quick succession aa If covering
the advance of our infantry on Caney.
No- one doubted the place would be
occupied in two hours. From El Pozo
one could not see the land lying be
tween Capron's battery and Caney on
account of the trees and underbrush,
but the volleys seemed to come from
the thickly wooded valley. I could see
clearly in Saji . van what was evidently
a part of the olr". city wall and fort
with Its high roof. Outside these are
earthworks and wire fences, but these
were screened by the! woods. There is
a hill b een El Pozo and San Juan
battery rising higher on the left and
hides the main section of Santiago to
Eotne extent, but between the royal
palms on the hill I could see a long
stretch of roofs, and the officers were
puzzled to observe white or red cross
flags floating above many of the houses.
The Cubans explained that these flags
were displayed by all the residents of
Santiago who either took no part in
the war or harbored no soldiers in the
hope that the Americans would spare
their houses when bombarding.
Two field guns on El Pozo command
ed the San Juan section of the city.
The officers in charge told me the range
was 2500 yards. At half-past 8 o'clock
the guns on El Pozo joined the music
of Capron's battery. The rifles were
making things lively north of us. The
first shell just grazed the roof. of the
central building on the San Juan wall.
Dust arose lazily from the top t>f it
and the shell passed on, bursting on
the other side. The range had been well
calculated. A roar of approval ran
along El Pozo. Then a gun was tried
it a slightly less elevation. Its mis
sile flew true to the mark, and its
twang was still in our ears when dust
c'-ouds rose from the roof and settled,
disclosing a great hole which seemed
twenty or thirty feet in diameter. The
third shot went higher, and the fourth

The men were most enthusiastic, cry
ing "On to Santiago!" There, was no
intention to rush to. the city, but. at
first to attempt to dislodge the, Spanish
from their earthworks and from behind
their barbed wire fences by our artil
lery. The enemy's hope evidently was
that the.. Americans would attempt to
capture .their earthworks at the outset
. by : .a strong '.advance^ of infantry across
the ground, that was' swept by the
deadly. fire of the men behind them:-'

approach. â¢it is said there : are six
fences and three liriÂ«s of earthworks
outside of San Juan, but these are
hidden by the hill, across:, the crest of
which the elevated forts were shelled.
Santiago newspapers brought to Gen
eral Shafter's headquarters give a
weird account of the alleged victory of
the Spanish over the Rough Riders, but
its correct information as to the names
of our regiments engaged leads me to
believe that there may have been a spy
in our lines last Friday.
Admiral Sampson sent Flag Lieuten
ant Stantori to consult General Shafter
yesterday, and . this morning as the
troops moved forward toward El Pozo
and the* other hills a mile and a half
to two miles off Santiago the flagship
ran close in shore and took up a posi
tion at the mouth of the valley three
miles east of Morro and began to shell
the Spanish infantry who were coming
out of the woods to the westward of
the position toward which Shafter was
moving his field batteries.
The New York lay in a cloud of
smoke for nearly two hours, keeping
up a terrific fire, her shells bursting
wherever glasses disclosed the move
ment of Spanish troops in the thick
cover to the west. A signal hoisted at
10 o'clock brought a converted yacht to
her assistance in the work, and at noon
the rest of the squadron moved in to
ward the batteries east and west of
Morro and began a general bombard
ment.
Seven ships were engaged on the in
ner line a few minutes past noon, and
the reply from the batteries, which had
been desultory from the first, had les
sened perceptibly.
It was said that when the army has
forced its way near enough to the city
proper â which may be Saturday â the
ships, having silenced the outer batter
ies, would â  move Into the harbor's
mouth, reduce the battery on Cayo
Smith, a small island inside, and two
of them take up positions near the Mer
rimac, where they could train guns on
Cervera's ships and the city itself. If
this is done it is believed the army will
soon succeed in entering Santiago from
the east in -He of the Spanish troops
and take possc~sion. As far as I could
learn none of our ships were damaged
up to the time the Golden Rod left.

â this dispatch is hurried away. â¢
General Lawto'n's- division bivouacked
near El Caney last night without fires.
At 7 o'clock this morning there was a
sullen "boo-m.." It was the first shot
from Capron's battery, fired to avenge
the killing of his son. . Promptly the
Spanish began to answer the challenge
from their trenches .and forts. At 7:15
.Grimes', battery opened on the Spanish
troops to the right of the San Juan
blockhouse. '
The- .common powder used by our
troops smoked . and was a fine target
for. the Spanish field battery, which
probably wasserved by Admiral Cer
v.era's marines, judging by the accur
acy of the aim.
While our smoke' gave the enemy our
range,. Grimes-could not locate the en
emy's guns; which used smokeless pow
der, .except approximately. But, satis
fied as to the Spanish position, our men
worked like mad. The Spanish fire
gradually slackend, and in less than
an hour it ceased altogether.
Battery A of the Second Artillery de
se.rve great credit for the victory, for
It was a case of blindness against sight.
The battery's losses, the officers state,
were as follows:
KILLED:
UNDERWOOD, private.
HELM, private.
WOUNDED:
GEORGE C. HEART, first
sergeant.
VEITE, sergeant.
CORNFORD, sergeant.
KEENE, corporal.
The battery was supported by the
Rour'i Riders, about 100 Cubans with a
Hotchkiss gun, a detachment of the
Tenth Cavalry and a squad from Com
pany C of the Second Cavalry. Most of
the Spanish shells flew low over the
crest of the battery's position and ex
ploded. Through them the Rough
Riders had about ten wounded, among
them being the following: S. G. Devore,
sergeant, Troop X; W. A. Armstrong,
corporal, Troop J; McSparron, corporal,
Troop G; Alvln C. Ash, private, Troop
G; W. A. Freeman, private, Troop F;
B. A. Long, private, Troop X; Mason
Mitchell, private, Troop K.
V. D. Horton. corporal, Troop I, Third
United States Cavalry, was also
wounded.
The Cuban leader, Gonzales, reports
that the Cubans lost twenty killed and
wounded.
The details of General Lawton's losses
have not arrived.
Captain Grimes and Corporal McLean
were overcome by the heat, but are re
covering.
The battery shot 100 rounds, two
thirds shells and the balance shrapnel.
The military balloon used by the sig
nal corps for the purpose of obtaining
accurate information of the location of
the enemy and the character of their
defenses proved r inestimable service
in the engagement. The balloon floated
just over the tree tops and was easily
guided along three miles of the road
toward the lines of the enemy.
Whenever it halted for the purpose of
taking a photograph of the fortifica
tions below, the Spaniards seized the
occasions for taking pot shots at the
mid-air monster. At one time the big
balloon hung over San Juan, not over
500 yards from the enemy.
In the fighting at San Juan a Span
ish shell two and a half inches in di
ameter burst in the midst of Captain
Puritier's battery in the First Artilery,
wounding several.

observation balloon used by the
army rendered good service, dis
closing the enemy's position and
gaining much valuable informa
tion. The balloon, at which the
enemy fired repeatedly, finally
was split by shrapnel.
Our hospital at Siboney is now
crowded with wounded soldiers.
The surgeons are busy bandag
ing wounds of this soldier or am
putating the fingers, arms or legs
of that soldier. In caring for the
wounded the Red Cross vessel
State of Texas is giving all the
aid it can. All the typhoid pa
tients will be transferred from the
Olivette to the Iroquois.
During yesterday's engage
ment the heat was intense, but
there were few cases of prostra
tions.

MONTEGO BAY, Island of Jamaica,
Friday, July 1 (delayed in transmis

surgents near ManzaniHo, Provinfce of
Santiago de Cuba, who landed near
here to-day from a siilboat, brought
intelligence that the Spanish troops,
numbering about 800J men", who left
Manzanillo on Jyne 24 to march to San
tiago,, were called back by General
Pando. It appears that when the army
had reached the vicinity of Bayamo,
General Pando wa? not with the troops,
as had been reported. He was and is
in Havana. The relieving army, the

fight longer against such a supe
rior enemy. . Accordingly the
Wanipatuck hastened to the res
cue of the Hornet, the Hist
meantime keeping up its sharp
est fire. : . â¢ ' .
. After the YVampatuck had suc
ceeded in getting a line on the
Hornet she steamed out to sea
with the disabled vessel in tow.
The Hist followed close after,
pouring. shot at the enemy until
out of. range.
During the engagement the
American vessels succeeded in
sinking one of the Spanish gun
boats, one sloop and one pon
toon. They also disabled the en
emy's torpedo-boat, did much
damage to several of the gun
boats in the harbor, and made a
marked impression on the Span
ish land batteries.
They also discovered the Pu
risima Concepcion and two
large transports lying in the har
bor.
As if this were not enough ex
citement for one day the small
auxiliary cruiser Hist poked her
nose into Neguira Bay and dis
covered a Spanish gunboat lying
there. She immediately opened
fire on the Spaniard, which, ta
ken completely by surprise, re
plied feebly and inaccurately. She
was sunk by the Hist in ten min
utes.
The Hist subsequently had an
other exciting experience with a
ship laden with Spanish troops
and again the little nghter came
out with new laurels. She dis
covered a troopship some dis
tance out from the shore, and
promptly challenged her.
The ship did not stop when Lhe
Hist fired a shot across her bow.
Instead, her captain, sent her to
ward the shore.
The captain of the Hist knew
that he could take his little craft
just as far in as the Spaniards
could go with the troopship, so
he started in hot pursuit aftei the
larger vessel. He could not cap
ture the ship, but he drove her
aground. Without attempting
to save their vessel the Spaniards
scrambled ashore and disap
peared in the woods.
All three vessels sent by Ad
miral Sampson to Manzanillo are
members of the auxiliary fleet.
The Hist formerly was the Thes
pia. She is 174 feet long, 23 feet
wide, and has a displacement of
472 tons.
The Hornet was formerly the
Alicia. She is 160 feet long, 24
feet wide and has a displacement
of 425 tons.
The Wampatuck was the tug
Atlas. She is 117 feet long and
25 feet wide. Her displacement
is 462 tons and she can make
thirteen knots an Jiour.
The Hornet is a lifteen-knot
boat, and the Hist makes twelve
knots an hour.

OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, with the
fleet, July 1, via Kingston, Jamaica,
July 2, 8 a. m. â Before 5 o'clock this
morning the me of the flagship were
astir, eating a hurried breakfast, and
at 6:50 "general quarters" was sounded
a; 1 the flagship headed in toward
Aguadores, about three miles east of
Morro Castle. The other ships retain
ed their blockading stations.
Along the surf-beaten shore the
smoke of an approaching train from
Altares was seen. It was composed
of open cars full General Dulfleld's
troops. At the cutting, a mile east of
Aguadores, the train stopped and the
Cuban scouts proceeded along the rail
road tracks. ' he troops got out of the
cars and soon formed in a lonp, thin
line, standing out vividly against the
yellow rocks that arose perpendicular
ly above, â¢ 'ittlng them off from the
main body of the army, which is on
the east side of the hill, several miles
north. From the quarterdeck of the
flagship there was a signal by a vigor
oub wigwagging, and a few minutes
later, from a lump of green at the
water's edge, came an answer from
the army. T 1 ' was the first co-op
eration for offensive purposes between
the army and navy. The landing of the
army at Baiquiri and Altares was
purely a naval affair. With the flag
in his hand, the soldier ashore looked
like a butterfly.
"Are you waiting for us to begin?"
was the signal made by Read-Admiral
Sampson to the army.
"General Duffleld Is ahead of the
scoutÃ," cam the answer from the
shore to the flagship.
By this time It was 7 o'clock, and the
admiral ran the flagship's bow within
three-quarters of a mile of the beach.
She remained almost as near during the
forenoon, and the daring way she was
handled by Cantain Chadwick within
Bound of the breakers made the Cuban
pilot on board stare with astonishment.
The Suwanee was In company with
the flap-hip, still closer in shore, and
the Gloucester was to the westward,
near Morro Castle. From the south
ward the Newark came on and took a
position to the westward. Her decks
were black with 1600 or more troops, as
she went alongside the flagship and
was told to disembark the men at Al
tares. Then Admiral Sampson signaled
to General DufTield:
"When do you want us to commence
firing?"
In a little while a white flag on shore
sent back the answer:
"When the rest of the command ar
rives. Then I will signal you."
It was a long and tedious wait for
the ships before the second fifty car
loads of troops came puffing along from
Altares. By 9:30 o'clock the last of the
soldiers had left the open railroad
tracks, disappearing in the thick brush
that covered the eastern side of Agua
dores Inlet. The water In the sponge
tubes under the breeches of the big
guns was growing hot In the burning
eun.
Ashore there was no sign of the en
emy. The Spaniards were believed to
be on the western bluff. Between the
bluffs runs a rocky gully leading into
Santiago City. On the extremity of the
western arm was an old fort from
which the flags were flying, and on a
parapet of the eastern hill, command
ing the gully, two stretches of red
earth could easily be seen against the
brush. These were the rifle pits.
At 10:15 the signal flag on shore wig
wagged to Admiral Sampson to com
mence firing, and a minute later the
New York blazed away at the rifle pits
and at the old fort.
The Suwanee and Gloucester Joined
in the echoes which rumbled around
and filled the gully. All the s>tored-up
thunder of the clouds seemed to have
broken loose, and smoke soon arose
over the hills, and the gully was shut
out from view. Then the firing became
more deliberate. Of our troops ashore
in the brush nothing could be seen, but
there could be heard the "ping, ping"
of the smallarms during a lull in the
firing of the big guns. These were pep
pering the rifle pits and clouds of red
earth arose around them.
An eight-inch shell from the Newark
dropped in ihe massive old fort, and
clouds of white dust and huge stones
filled the air. When the small shel.s
hit the battlements, almost hidden by
green creepers, fragments of masonry
came tumbling down. A shot from the
Suwanee hit the eastern parapet and it
crumbled away like air. Amid the
smoke and debris the flagstaff was seen
to fall from It.
"The flag has been shot down," shout
ed the ship's crew, but when the smoke
cleared away the emblem of Spain was
seen to be still flying and blazing bril
liantly in the sun, though the flagstaff
was bending toward the earth. Ap
parently the flagstaff had been caught
firmly In the wreckage of the fort. A
few more shots leveled the battlements
until the castle was a pitiful sight.
At 11:30 General Dumeld signaled that
his scouts reported that no damage had
been done to the Spanish rifle pits by
the shells from the ships and Admiral
Sampson told him they had been hit
several times, but that there was no one
in the pits. However, the Suwanee wan
ordered to fire a few more shots in
their direction.
At 12:18 p. m. the New York, \aving
discontinued firing at Aguadores, com
menced -ring 8-lnch shells clear over
the gully into Â°- - city of Santiago de
Cuba. Every five minutes the shells
went rearing over the hillside. What
d ruction tin.,- wrought it was impos
sible to tell, as the bluffs hide every
thing.
To General Puffleld's question "What
is tlie news?" Admiral Sampson re
plied:
"There is -ot a Spaniard left in the
rifle pits."
Later General Duffleld signaled that
his scouts thought re-enforcements
were marching to the battered old fort
and Admiral Sampson wigwagged to
him:
"There are no Spaniards left there.
If any come the Gloucester will take
| care of them."
A little later the Oregon joined the
New York in sending 8-inch shells into
the city of Santiago.
This was kept up until 1:40 p. m.' By
that time General Duffield hud sent a
message saying his troops could, not
cross the stream and would return to
Altares. Acting upon the report that
some Spanish troops were still in the
gully the New York and Gloucester
shelled it once more and the Newark,
which had not fired, signaled:
"Can I flre for target practice? Have
had no previous opportunity."
Permission for her to do so was sig
naled and she blazed away, shooting
well, her 6-lnch shells exploding with
remarkable force among the rocks.
At 2:40 p. m. Admiral Sampson
hoisted the signal to cease firing and
the flagship returned to the blockading
squadron.
On the railroad a train load of troops
had already left for AltarÂ°s.

GENERAL A. R. CHAFFEE.
SHIFTER
HAS LOST
HEAVILY
WASHINGTON, July 2.â Owing to the many conflict
ing reports of the losses of the American troops in yester
day's engagement, it has been thought best by the War De
partment officials to make public, the text of General Shaf
ter's last dispatch, received this morning at 4. o'clock. It is
as follows: â¢â  .' '.:.-' ''â¢â¢ 'â .â¢â¢'. ; .â ;' .>â }'"!:
"SIBONEY, July i:â Adjutant. General, Washingtbii:
I fear I have underestimated to-day's casualties.. A.large and
thoroughly equipped hospital ship should be sent here at
once to care for the wounded. The chief surgeon says he has
use for forty more medical officers. The ship must bring, a
launch and boats for conveying the wounded, '. â¢"
"SH AFTER, Major General Commanding.'- -.
The Associated Press dispatch from the field, igiving the.
casualties at about 1000, is in line with General Shafter's
later intimation, although, as stated, he has set no figures. /
WASHINGTON, July 2.â This has
been a day of almost unparalleled sus
pense and anxiety. From President
McKlnley down all through official
Washington everybody was under a
tremendous strain. Tidings from Shaf
ter have been eagerly awaited and
momentarily expected, but save a brief
word on the extent of the loss yester
day nothing came from him during the
day concerning the progress of the ac
tion at Santiago.
Just at the close of the day the first
bit of information coming directly to
the officials reached the President and
Secretary Alger. It was a private dis
patch, not primarily Intended for them,
although it came through official chan
nels. Briefly and expressively It told
the story of a day of terrific fighting.
It was direct from the field of action
as late as 4 p. m. It stated that the
engagement had been in progress
throughout to-day; that the dead and
wounded were being carried to the rear

and that the American losses wefe.
heavy. The exact wording of the dis
patch was not made known, but one
of the high officials who read it said
it conveyed to him the Idea of extreme
tension and of a battle in which all the
fiercest elements of warfare prevailed.
Until this came the officials were pos
itively without a word as to whether
the engagement begun yesterday was
continuing to-day. They could only
speculate, some taking the view that
the assault of yesterday had been fol
lowed by a Btormlng of the city itself,
others maintaining that Shafter!s
troops, spent with the terrible strain -of
yesterday, had paused to-day long
enough to clear the field of its dead, and
wounded.
It was only this, brief message, which
under ordinary circumstances : would
have received- little attention, that the
President and his advisers were made
aware that the battle was still in
progress and still without definite is-

GERMANS ARE WARNED
AGAINST INTERFERENCE
COMMANDER
OF WARSHIPS
IS NOTIFIED
Admiral Dewey Plainly
Says b\\s Programme
Must Stand.
Unless Yon Diedrichs Desires to
Precipitate a Conflict With Uncle
Sam He Will Tal^e Heed.
NEW YORK, July 2.â The Herald's Washington cor
respondent telegraphs: "Rear Admiral Dewey has warned
the commander ot the German warships at against
interference with the war programme of this Government."
This statement was made to me this afternoon by an of
ficial of the. administration, who is' thoroughly familiar with
the reports â¢ made by Rear Admiral Dewey to the Navy De
partment.
"Unless Vice Admiral yon Diedrichs .desires to precipi
tate a war between' Germany and the United States," my
informant continued, "he will heed what Rear . Admiral
Dewey has said."
"Bear Admiral Dewey, under the in
structions k'ivon him, will commence'
operations against the city of Miinila
immediately upon the arrival â of the"
American troops. I believe the first de
tachment of these troops, 2JOO strong,
'."are- now at their destination, and our
next advices from the American com
. iriamkr will announce that th-ey have
landed at Cavite and are preparing to
operate against the city In conjunction
with the insurgents. These prepara
tions ought not to occupy any great
length of time, for the reason the war-
Bh'i-ps will be able to bombard the
Spanish strongholds. Attacked from
the front and rear, the capitulation is
certain.
"On- account of the Philippines being
the. probable destination of the fleet
undf-r command of Admiral Camara, it
is desired by the official* that Manila
Bhi.i 11 be taken, guns erected and'
mounted and the harbor mined, in or
dÂ»T that the position of the American
warships, and troops may be absolutely
.impregnable.
â¢ "If.Cama.ra goes to the Philippines .at
all," paid 'the official who was discuss
ing the Philippines situation with me,
â¢ "he wi.li. ayoid Manila, but will prowl
around the islands, doing as much
damage to. the American cause as pos
sible, and show to the world by his
movements that the Philippines, with
the exception of Manila, still belong to
Bpain. Among nations friendly to Spain
her position in this matter might . be
considered tenable. It is to prevent
Admiral Camara from making such a
demonstration that Commodore Wat
son's command will be sent in pursuit
to destroy or capture the enemy's men
of-war."
Secretary Day said this evening that
he had no information confirmatory of
the report that France, Russia and
Germany had reached an agreement
to interfere in the Philippines when
hostilities cease to prevent the United
States or Great Britain gaining posses
sion of the whole of the islands. He
Indicated that he placed no credence in
the report.
Administration officials ridicule the
report that when the war is over an
international congress will be proposed
to settle all questions connected with
it, and that all the great powers, in
cluding Spain and the United States,
will be invited to join.. Officials with
whom I talked said that the war was
between the United States and Spain,
and that they alone would settle the
terms of peace.
SITUATION IS YET
MOST CRITICAL
Augusti Informs the Madrid Govern
ment of State of Affairs
at Manlia.
MADRID, July 2.â A dispatch was re
ceived here to-day from' Genc-al Au
gusti, dated Manila, June 26, via Hong
kong, in which he Eays:. .
"The situation continues as critical
as announced in my dispatch of June
15. Fifteen German, French, Japanese
and Itritish war vessels are anchored
In the bay. Through them there is
frequent communication at Hongkong.
General Monet, after fighting several
battles, has arrived at Macabore with a
thousand men, where he is intrenched.
In the event of the enemy advancing
on the capital I have ordered General
Mon.t to force his way through to my
help, tfc ugh I regard such an opera
tion as difficult."
MAY COMBINE AGAINST
THE UNITED STATES
Germany, France and Eussia Said to
Have Agreed as to the
Philippines.
BERLIN, July 2.â On the best au
thority, the correspondent here of the
Associated Press is informed that Ger
many, France and Russia have reach
ed an understanding relative to the
Philippine Islands. It is said that these
three powers do not intend to actively
Interfere until hostilities cease, after
which they will combine to prevent the
United States. or Great Britain gaining
possession of the whole of the Philip
pine Islands. When the war is over an
international congress will be proposed,
similar to the Berlin Congress of ISTB,
to settle all questions connected with
the war. All the great powers will be
Invited to join, including the United
States and Spain. It appears certain
that Germany will demand a slice of
the Philippine Islands or other com
pensation in the far East.
The same authority said that Ger
many is doing a thriving trade hi pro
visions, especially peas, beans and
canned goods, and in ammunition and
small arms, through Hamburg commis
sion merchants, who are selling to both
Spain and the United States. The lat
ter, it appears,' is buying quantities of
th.? potassium used for saltpeter from
the big German alkali works. All these
goods, it is asserted, are shipper! from
Copenhagen mainly by the Thingvalla
line. The German Government has
ordered that three cruisers be kept in
West Indian waters. In Bpite of the
war the German exports to America
are as large as ever.
NO CAUSE FOR ALARM
AT THEIR NON-ARRIVAL
First Philippine Expedition Prob
ably Delayed by the Charles
ton's Stop at Guahan.
NEW YORK, July 3.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Officials In
both the War and Navy Departments
are of the opinion that there is no cause
for alarm at the non-arrival of the first
Philippine expedition at Manila. This
expedition Failed on May 25, and If it
proceeded directly to Manila, should
have arrived there about June 25. Up
to the last advices received by the
Navy Department the expedition had
not reached its destination. Although
the officials are unable to give any rea
son for the &Â»l*y in this expedition
reaching Manila, they surmise there
may have been some delay caused by
the programme which contemplated a
stop at Gualyin in the Ladrone Islands.
Guahan is about 1500 miles from Ma
nila, and is defended by old fortifica
tions provided with old style smooth
bore guns. The object in sending the
expedition to that place was to have
the Charleston, which convoyed the ex
pedition, reduce the fortifications and
thus obtain a coaling station for the
other American vessels. No doubt that
this part of the programme, was suc
cessfully executed, but. it Is thought
not unlikely the expedition may have
been delayed at Guahan longer than
was expected.
HAS CONFIDENCE IN
*â¢ AMERICA'S FAIRNESS
Aguinaldo Expects That the Philip
pine Insurgents Will Beceive
All Their Rights.
LONDON. July 2.â The Hongkong
correspondent of the Daily Mall says:
To a friend of United States Consul
Wildman General Aguinaldo has de
clared:
"The Philipplnos have the greatest
confidence in America's fairness. We
trust the American people, confident
that, with their support, we shall be
able to obtain and hold our full rights
and shall be respected by all the Euro
pean powers. The Americans are re
dressing Cuban wrongs and will do the
same for us in the Philippines."
A dispatch to the Cologne Gazette
from Hongkong declares that General
Aguinaldo, flushed with victory, insists
upon the absolute independence of the
Philippines. Another report alleges
that then is an agreement between the
United States and Japan to prevent the
interference of Russia and Germany in
the Philippines.

THE FAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 3, 1898.
PLAN OF PORT SAID, EGYPT, AT THE MEDITERRANEAN ENTRANCE OF THE
SUEZ CANAL, WHERE THE SPANISH FLEET UNDER ADMIRAL CAMARA
NOW LIES.
TWO SHIPS
ENTER THE
SUEZ CANAL
NEW YORK, July 2.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: The Span
ish ships Colon and Covadonga entered
the Suez Canal yesterday. The rest,
with the exception of one repairing,
have left the harbor, coaling from their
transports.
This is the extent of a cablegram re
ceived this afternoon at the State De
partment from Deputy Consul Watts,
who is attached to the Cairo consulate,
but who was sent to Port Said to ob
serve the movements of the Spanish
fleet, and in conjunction with Consular
Agent Broadbent. make every effort to
prevent any violation of neutrality laws
along the canal or at Its entrances. The
departure of the fleet with the excep
tion of one vessel, the torpedo-boat de
stroyer Audaz, whose machinery was
damaged during the run from Cadiz
and which is undsrgoing repairs, shows
that Admiral Camara in deference to
the Egyptian Government, which has
been considering the protest filed by
American agents against permitting
the fleet to remain too long a time at
Port Said, has gone outside the harbor
for the purpose of coaling from trans
ports which have reached Port Said.
The Colon and Covadonga are
merely supply ships, the former carry
ing stores and the latter coal.
The officials understand that Admiral
Camara's fleet will coal from the Cova
donga in case they should pass through
the canal, the Egyptian Government
having declined to permit any of the
colliers at Port Said to proceed to the
Red Sea and then furnish coal to the
Spaniards. It is understood in naval
circles that Camara's ships are coaling
from the Isla de Luzon and San Ig
nacio, which arrived a few days ago
from Spain.
The Navy Department learned to-day
from an official source that the report
is current In Madrid it is the Intention
of the Ministry to direct Camara. to
return to Spain.
The department has also heard the
report that three torpedo-boat destroy
ers with the Spanish fleet are to be re
turned to- Cadiz, and while it is believed
to be true, nothing positive can be said
on this point. It is expected Camara's
fleet will have completed coaling by to
morrow or Monday and its movements
after that time are awaited with inter
est.
A strong belief is current in official
circles that In declaring the departure
of the squadron from Port Said Spain
is guided by a desire to learn the re
sult of the campaign against Cervera's
ships. Watson's squadron will not sail
in pursuit of Camara until after the
fall of Santiago de Cuba and the de
struction of Cervera's fleet. When this
work has been accomplished the de
partment's order requires the formation
of Commodore Watson's fleet. It will
at once start on its voyage to destroy
Admiral Camara's command.
Secretary Long stated to-night that
no change had been made In the naval
programme. Commodore Watson's
fleet, he eald, would sail for Spain in a
few days, even should Camara's squad
ron return to Spain.
CAMARA'S FLEET
REPORTED STARTED
An Ironclad Bought From China Said
to Be Waiting at the Other
End of the Canal.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, July 2.â Camara's fleet, it
Is announced officially, has started. It
Is also stated that the ironclad bought
from the Chin se Government awaits it
on the other end " the canal. The re
turn of the torpedo boat destroyers is
important.
Minister for Foreign Affairs, DukeAl
modovar de Rio. has caused it to be an
nounced that the only difficulties met
with in Egype were due to the repre
sentations of the American Consul
against the duration of the squadron's
stay and the purchase of coal. The
passage of the canal, the Minister ex
plained, could not present any diffi
culty.
GIBRALTAR, July 2.â lnfantry, cav

Five guns have been sent to Vigo for
the Cabodemar and Bula batteries.

LINARES FALLS AND
THE CAPTURE IS BUT
A FEW HOURS AWAY
Bpecial cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by J&mn Gor
don Bennett.
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY,
via Playa del Este, Cuba, July 3.â The
chances that General Shafter and the
army of Americans will celebrate the
Fourth of July in Santiago are very
bright. They have done another not
able day's work In their assault
against the Spanish forces. Their vic
torious progress, begun yesterday, has
been continued.
It has been a day of desperate fight
ing on both sides. The American and
Spanish leaders have thrown them
selves into the front line and they fig
ure largely in the list c- dead and
wounded.
General Linares, the Spanish com
mander, was shot down in the prelim
inary fighting yesterday. Several
colonels and lieutenant colonels in the
American columns were killed.
From latest reports it is believed the
Americans have sustained losses in the
two days' fighting of twelve hundred
killed and wounded. The Spanish loss
is much greater. At least one thosuand
Spaniards have been killed and- two
thousand have been taken prisoners by
our forces. â¢ â¢
The divisions of Lawton and Chaffee,
which did gallant work throughout the
day, effected a junction at noon to-day
and did most effective work against the
enemy. They went to the front in an al
most irresistible charge against the
center of the enemy's lines.
After great .effort the Americans
placed their artillery in positions from
which they effectually cannonaded the
city. At noon the telling effect of the
artillery and infantry attacks was be
coming apparent, and the fall of the
city was seen to be only a question of
hours.
Among the American dead are:
LIEUTENANT DUCAT, Twenty
fourth Infantry.
LIEUTENANT AUGUSTIN, Twenty-.
fourth Infantry.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL CAR
ROLL, Ninth Cavalry, who succeeded
Hamilton.

have reached the besieged city frcm i

that city cannot fall to affect the very
existence of the Government here, but
thus far perfect tranquility prevails.SPLENDID

Kingston,. : . Jamaica, July 2.â The battle
of Santiago -has raged "all day and at
4 o'clock this afternoon 15,000 American
troops are thundering at the outer for
tifications of the doomed city. Since
daybreak General Shatter's army has I
fought its way across two and a half
miles of bitterly- contested and strongly
fortified country and the. entire line of.
the men to the' right is within gunshot
of Santiago town.
The American loss thus far' is esti

the brush in .the valley,, meeting with

vanced along the north slope, the in

Under the musketry fire of the cay- !
alrymen the Spaniards- in the little
town oX El Paso retreated and Captain

and began rapid firing into Cariey. The !
guns of the two batteries made, the !

After the enemy had been driven

ing, batteries â¢ banged away, -Captain
Grimes sending a storm. 'of lead. down
into the outer fortifications and' the
Spaniards pounding away at. the hill
" top with, vicious "persistency. Most of
the Spanish shells went over the-hill
tops, and- fell in a ravine beyond. Here
several detachments of Cuban troops
were stationed as reserves, and before i
they could be moved seven insurgents
were seriously wounded and several
slightly hurt. At the same time two
Americans were killed and nine
wounded.
The Spaniards used smokeless pow
der and shot with much more accuracy
than during the previous engagement.
The wonder is that many more lives
were not lost, as the opposition bat
teries were less than two miles apart.
Colonel Wood's command behaved
with great bravery, firing steady and
deadly volleys, with the enemy's shells
screeching and bursting over their
heads. Twenty minutes of fearfully
hot work silenced the Spanish batte
ries. Ten shots were sent into them
after they ceased firing, but there was
Ho response, and it is "resumed that
the guns were dismounted or the gun
ners driven off.
Away to the left, General Lawton's
division, with Chaffee's men and Ca
pron's battery, was fighting fiercely
with the enemy entrenched in and
about Caney. The Spaniards contended
every Inch of ground bitterly and
fought with unexpected coolness and
courage, but the irresistible onward
movement of the Americans slowly
forced them back upon and beyond
Caney.
At about 11 o'clock the terrible fire
from Captain Capron's guns and ..ne
muskets of the men broke the Spanish
line and a retreat began toward the
line of outer fortifications. The ene
my took the trail known as the main
Santiago road, and Captain Grimes'
battery immediately began pitching
shells in ahead of the retreating men,
while a detachment of 2000 Cubans,
headed l> Garcia, was started to cut
off the retreat.
No report has yet been received from
tre in. A large detachment of General
Kent's reserves was sent to aid General
Garcia in this work, and it is probable
fierce fighting occurred.
All this time General Sumner had
commanded the center, owing to Gen
eral Wheeler's illness, but at about
11:30 General Wheeler Btarted on the
two-mile journey to the front in an am
bulance. About half way to the front
he met a number of litters bearing
wounded. The veteran, under protest
by the sureeons, immediately ordered
his horse, and, after personally assist
ing the wounded into the ambulance,
mounted and rode onward. The men
burst into frantic cheers, which followed
the general all along the line.
By noon, although still very ill, Gen
eral Wheeler had established ht-adquar
ters a* the extreme front and center of
the line, and still holds his position.
Th-- hardest fighiing of the day seems
to have been on the ri^ht ttank, and
heavy casualties are reported from
there. The advance there was more
rapid than at other points on the line,
and General Chuffee's brigade was the
first to cross the Little San Juan.Rivec
close to the line of outer fortifications.
At 2 o'clock Caney had not been en
tered by the American troops, but they
had pushed past and it was theirs at
any time they desired to march into it.
At that hour General Shafter, whose
headquarters for the day had been
three miles to the rear, went forward
to assume personal command of the
t/perations.
Some surprise is felt that he did not
wait for the siege guns before begin
ning the final attack. The siege,
are still on the beach at Baiqulri, but
he decided yesterday that th\y were
unnecessary and determined to strike
at once.
The only movement that did not meet
with sue â¢ ,-:-s was General Duffield's at
tempt to occupy the sea village of
Aguadores. The . New York, Suwanee
and Gloucester shelled the old fort and
the rifie pits during the forenoon, drove
all the Spaniards from the vicinity and
bowled over the parapet from which
(lew the Spanish flag, but owing to the
blowing up of the railroad bridge Gen
eral Duffield's troops were unable to get
across the river which separated them
from the little town and were com
pelled to go back to Jura^ua. It is
probable that an effort will be made
to-morrow to repair the bridge and a
complete movement attempted.
To-day it was reported ut Juragon
that General Duflleld had been de
feated. This is not true, ais he did not
encounter any large body of Spaniards.
Many dramatic incidents occurred
during the day, with numerous evi
dences of the splendid personal bravery
of the American officers and men in
their work of continuous and intense
physical strain, owing to the hills and
swamps and the fierce tropical sun,
which hammered down upon them the
greater part of the day.
The Cubans beh.ved with skill and
valor, and rendered valable aid. Gen
eral Garcia and the other Cuban gen
erals led the troops in person, and
showed great coolness in ti.ght places.
The Spanish fought stubbornly
throughout, and the retreat, though
steady, was slowly and coolly conduct
ed. They contested every inch of the
way and fought with unexpected skill,
their. Officers handling the troops with
bravery and good judgment. As in all
of th"ir fighting so far, however, they
did most of their work under cover,
rarely showing themselves in large
bodies in the open.
All th.> retreats worn toward Santi
ago, ar.d it is probable that by night
fall th* entire force of Spaniards in the
province of Santiago de Cuba will be
within ftp city walls, with the excep
tion of WOO men under General Pando,
whose ntt.-mpt to re-enforce Santiago Is
believed to have been frustrated.

SAMPSON MAY
ENGAGE CERVERA
THIS MORNING
NEW YORK, July 2.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Official Washington is appre
hensive that the occupation of the for
tifications defending the harbor of San
tiago is proving more difficult than has
been expected. It was of the utmost
importance that these fortifications
should be captured before the final as
sault is made on the city. The Span
ish troops in Santiago are assisted in
their work of resisting the invaders
just as the American troops would be
if fighting the enemy under the guns
of Rear Admiral Sampson's fleet.
The destruction of the defenses is
absolutely necessary in order to take
the city without enormous loss and de
stroy Cervera's ships. It can be ac
complished only by American men-of
war, which will be debarred from the
harbor as long as Spanish troops hold
Morro Castle and Estrella battery.
This represents the situation as
viewed by the war authorities. It is
reported the massing of General Duf
field's brigade near Aguadores is in
pursuance of a plan of campaign which
is being followed by General Shafter.
Evidently General Duffield's troops
have been chosen to assault Morro
Castle and carry it by storm.
The operations of this brigade are
likely to be handicapped by the action
of the Spaniards in destroying the rail
road bridge crossing Guama River,
which was ar omplished, according to
an official dispatch from Rear Admiral
Sampson, notwithstanding the hot fire
maintained by the American warships.
The stream will have to be bridged by
the engineers with the brigade, and
when troops are over it, their work
against Morro Castle will be undoubt
edly undt-j heavy fire from the bat
teries which the Sniniards have erect
ed to defend the fortress.
It is hoped b the authorities General
Duffield's brigade has carried out this
feature of the programme and that the
capture of Morro Castle has been or
will soon be effected. In this event, as
was explained this morning, Rear Ad
miral Sampson will send out small
boats to destroy or raise the mines.
It is evident to the officials to-night
that the capture of the city will not
occur before Monday at the earliest.
Rear Admiral Sampson's ships may be
able to enter the harbor Sunday morn
ing ar.d in that case he may be able in
a few hours to engage and it is hoped
sink Cervera's ships.
When this has been accomplished the
American armorc'.ads and the dynamite
cruiser Vesuvius will take a position
in front of the city and fire upon the
Spanish positions while the troops as
sault the city on land. It is understood
in official circles that General Shafter
will take advantage of the intervening
time to station his troops so as to prac
tically surround the city and thus cut
off the escape of General Linares' com
mand.

ii. .n Bennett.
PLAYA DEL ESTE, July 2.â At day
break Lawton's troops were at Villa
Guron and moving toward Santiago.
They had taken Caney at 4 o'clock yes
terday at great expense. Chaffee sur
rounded the village, which is situated
on a hill protected by a fort and block
houses. Capron's battery, at a dis
tance of 2500 yards, demolished the
fort's tower and brought the Hag down.
The enemy's sharpshooters in trees
and steeples were hard to find on ac
count of their using smokeless powder.
A charge was ordered. The Twenty
fifth and Twelfth undertook it.
They formed 400 yards from the fort
and ran cheering against a volley fire,
many falling.
When they were but fifty yards away
the enemy lied, leaving forty dead. The
ruined, blood-spattered fort and block
houses were taken.
Forty Spanish were killed and 300 sur
rendered. Their commander gave his
sword to General JLudlow, while the
women of the village wept over the
wounded.
The Americ 3 lost 100 dead and 200
wounded. They proceeded supperless
toward Santiago, but were exhausted
and rested until dawn, three thousand
Cubans preventing the retreat of Li
nares.
RETIREMENT OF REAR

Withdrawal.
WASHINGTON, July 2.â Orders have
been given for the retirement to-mor
row of Rear Admiral William A. Kirk
land, the senior officer of the navy, now
acting as commandant of the Mare Isl
and navy-yard. Notwithstanding his
retirement, Admiral Kirkland will con
tinue his present command until the
termination of the war with Spain per
mits his relief by an officer on the act
ive list. His retirement will result in
promotions in all grades of the navy,
but only a few of them will be made at
once.
The promotions already determined
upon are as follows: Commodore F. V.
McNalr, now on special duty in this

commodore, ar.l Commander Francis
W. Dickins, assistant to the chipf of the
Bureau of Navigation, Navy Depart
ment, to be captain.
Commodore McNair and Captain

BRINGS DOWN
SPAIN'S FLAG IN
THREE SHOTS
Guooer on the Suwaoee KqocKs
tf)e Yellow Emblem F rom
Aguadores' port.
WITH THE FLEET OFF SANTIAGO, July 2.â When the bom
bardment of the fort at Aguadores yesterday was ordered to cease Lieu
tenant Deiehanty of the Suwanee signaled for permission to knock down the
Spanish flag.
"Yes," replied Admiral Sampson, "if you can do it in three shots."
When the smoke of the first shot cleared away only two streamers
of the flag were left. The shell had gone through the center of the
bunting.
A delighted yell broke forth from the crew of the Suwanee.
Two or three minutes later the Suwanee fired again, and huge
clouds of debris rose from the base of the flagstaff. Then it was seen
that the shell had only added to the ruin of the fort.
The Suwanee now changed her position slightly. Then a puff of
smoke shot out from her side, and up went spouting a cloud of debris
from the parapet and down fell the banner of Spain. Such yells from
the flagship will probably never be heard again.
"Well done," signaled Admiral Sampson to Lieutenant Commander
Deiehanty.
IN GERMAN
ELECTIONS
Director of the Imperial
Navy Is Accused of
Coercing Voters
Owing to Alleged Frauds of Gov
ernment Agents the Socialists
Will Contest Many Seats.
Copyrighted, IS9S, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, July 2.â The public con
tinues to be absorbed in the-quinquen
nial elections recently held in this
country and their results. The news
papers are teeming with incidents in-
dicative of queer electioneering meth
ods observed during -the campaign, and
a mass of evidence is presented prov
ing that intimidation was resorted to
in many districts, notably in the rural
sections.
The Socialists will contest a number
of seats, including the Dantzic con
stituency, w.ere the director of the Im
perial navy yard is charged with co
ercing voters to support the Govern
ment candidate. They will also con
test the seats in Cassel, Elbing and
Dortmund, and in the Second and
Fifth districts in Berlin.
In the latter place, it is alleged,
enough illegal ballots were counted in
favor of the anti-socialist candidate
to vitiate the result.
The increased strength of the Cen
trists is now 104, and the weakening of
the Government side in the Reichstag
induced the Centrists to formulate a
list of demands for the coming session,
including the recall of the Jesuits, the
abolition of the last remnants of
Cuturkampf, the reinstatement in the
constitution of the articles granting ab
solute political equality to the Catho
lic church and the restitution of the
Catholic department in the ministry of
public worship.
The representative of the Associated
Press learns, however, from good au
thority, that although he cannot pass
new measures without the co-operation
of the Centrists, Emperor William will
not sanction the recall of the Jesuits,
which the Centrists regard as the most
important of their demand. Emperor
William recently declared that as long
as he was King of Prussia the Bundes
rath should not have a Prussian vote
in favor of the recall of the Jesuits nor
of the other demands enumerated.
It is probable, therefore, that there
will be trouble between the Centrists
and the Government during the next
session, especially as a number of those
elected on the re-ballots, who were aid
ed by Centrist votes, are pledged to
support the Centrists in themselves,
giving the Center at least nineteen
votes.
The Conservative newspapers con
tinue the campaign for the abridgment
of the Reichstag franchise, maintaining
that this is necessitated by the Immense
growth of the Socialist vote. The rep
resentative of the Associated Press
learns that Emperor William and the
King of Saxony are both in favor of
this movement. The Emperor has in
structed the chief of his private cabi
net to prepare at the earliest moment a
report giving minute details of Social
ist progress, by districts, towns and
villages, the conditions governing each
and the fluctuations previous to elec
tion. A special Cabinet meeting will
be summoned to discuss the matter as
soon as the report is completed.
The press of the country Is now com
menting upon the Spanish-American
war In a more unbiased manner and
with less venom toward the Americans,
although the military editors continue
to regard the situation as very unfav
orable for the Americans as well as for
the Spaniards. With regard to Cuba,
it is thought that .the American forces,
apart from yellow jack and; the influ
ences of the climate, are entirely ' in
adequate. All the American operations
since the' United States forces have
been landed, it is asserted, have been
ill-advls=ed and showed lack of fore
sight. The fact th?t the army of occu
pation is so insufficiently equiDped with
everything needful shows, the paper"
declare, poor .sreneralship. |
Some comment has been nroujsprl by
TiUman's speech in thÂ« United States
Pen ate regarding the Philippines. Thy
National Zeituner: reiterates, the state
ment that, Germany has not yet shown
a desire to Interfere except to protect
Gorman subjects, should the necessity
arise.' which Is?' by no means unlikely,
as neither-, Spain nor the : United; States
seems to be able to cope .with the
natives.
The paper adds: "If the United
States should conquer and retain the
Philippines or if Spain relinquishes
them to the United States, then they
would become theirs by right of war,
and it is Improbable that any power
would go to war with the United States
in order to dispute their possession.
Should Spain, however, lose the Philip
pines without the United States con
quering them, then all the countries
interested in the far East would be
concerned in their fate."
At a meeting of the Colonial Society
at Dantzlc on Tuesday, at the instance
of the president a resolution was adopt
ed which is liable to create a variety
of trouble. The resolution provides
that no German, no matter where he
may emigrate, hereafter shall loss his
nationality, except on his own initia
tive. A bill embracing the resolution,
which is indorsed by the Emperor and
by many members of the Reichstag,
will be introduced at the coming ses
sion.
Prince Hohenlohe, the Imperial
Chancellor, although nearly 80 years of
age, is learning to ride the bicycle.
The yacht race arranged recently be
tween the Empress of Germany and her
sister-in-law, Princess Henry of Prus
sia, who were on board the iduna, late
the American schooner yacht Yampa,
against Emperor William on board his
new yacht Meteor, was sailed on Tues
day. The race started from Hemmel

Prince Bismarck is regaining his
health. He is able to walk again, and

Since March the orchards throughout

SIBONEY, Province of Santiago de
Cuba, July 1, 8 p. m., via Playa del
Este July 2.â At this hour the fighting
continues. The entire reserves of the
American army have been ordered to
the front at once, apparently with the
intention of forcing our way to San
tiago de Cuba. The troops have ad

tifications are very strong. Our losses
are heavy.
An officer from the field estimates
our killed and wounded .at 1000 men.
Shells, supposedly from the Spanish
fleet, did heavy execution among our
troops.
During a lull in the fighting an im
pressive incident occurred. The
Twenty-first Infantry was out in front
and suffering loss from the Spanish
fire, but the men sang "The Star

GENERAL SUMNER'S CAMP, BE
FORE SANTIAGO, Thursday. June 30
(by Herald-Call Dispatch-boat Golden
Rod to Kingston, Jamaica, Friday,
July 1). â The attack on Santiago is to
begin in a few hours â at 4 o'clock to
morrow. From this ridge we can see
the lights of the cityâ street lamps
shining across a sea of mist two miles
wide and two miles long, which looks
in the moonlight like a great lake in
the basin of the hills.
Three columns of United States sol
diers are to descend to-morrow- morning
into this basin and attack the city, eat
ing up on their way the little villages of
El Caney and San Juan. They have
been pouring down, since early this
morning, the narrow trail that leads
from Siboney to Santiago. They came
In two single lines over the foothills on
either side of the trail, a foot deep with
water and mud.
The line seems interminable. Thou
sands of men, slipping and stumbling
in the wet grass and mud, passed slow
ly. As there seemed no end to them,
some one said they were the same men
marching in a circle around the hills
to impress the Spanish outposts.
Hours passed and still the men
moved forward in unbroken lines, the
moon rose and still they passed, great,
stalwart giants in brown, and young
volunteers in brown, and cavalry
mounted and unmounted, white and
colored, and pack trains of mules fol
lowed the leader's bell. There were
long halts while generals and colonels
fumed and swore and sent aids splash
ing between the lines to hurry up one
regiment and send another down the
side trail on the banks on either side.
The Cuban army, ragged "and starved,
rested after their tr-n?e years of effort
and laughed and cuatted as though
they said, "Now you will know how it
is yourselves." Russia's military at r .
tache looked at them and smiled. "Save
me from my friends," he said, "I can
take care of my enemies myself."
If the regiments are not los,t irr the
underbrush, which is not likely to, hap
pen, as the moon makes everything as
light as day, the three columns will
advance at reveille to-morrow, tÂ»ut they
will move under a new commander.
In the army, whereas in spite of half
rations, tropical sun and tropical
storms, the sickness is only 2 per cent,
two of the generals are "down with
fever and have relinquished their com
mands. General Joseph Wheeler's
place is taken by General Sumner and
Colonel Wood of the Rough Riders
moves up to the command of a brigade
held by General Young, who is also
down with fever. Colonel Carroll of the
Sixth Cavalry takes General Sumner's
command of the First Brigade of
cavalry.
General Ludlow of the engineers, for
seme unknown reason, is made, by or
der from Washington, to take command
of Colonel Van Home's First Brigade
of Infantry of the second division. It
is proposed to reach San Juan, a little
suburb cf Santiago, just outside of
its gates. General Chaffee, with the
Twelfth Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel
Comba; Seventh, Colonel Benham, and
the Seventeenth, Lieutenant Celonel
Haskell, is to take El Caney, a town oc
cupied, it is believed, by one regiment
of Spanish soldiers. It is on the far
right of our line.
General Chaffee's attack on El Caney
is to be under the fire of Capron's bat
tery, which is on the hjll between El
Caney and the trail along which Chaf
fee will move. General Ludlow, with
the Second Massachusetts Regiment,
Colonel Clark: Twenty-secoiid Infan
try, Colonel Wikoff, and Eighth Infan
try, Major Conrad, is to re-enforce
Chaffee if necessary. Otherwise he is
to advance to the village of Duero, be
yond Caney. which is the most conspic
uous object in the basin. This will bring
him to the right o-f San Juan.
General Miles, with the Fourth In
fantry; Lieutenant Colonel Bainbridge,

First Infantry;- Lieutenant -Colonel

Lieutenant Colpiiel Dage^tt. is to wait
in support of GeneraJ Ludlow. On the- .'
extreme left of the plain as the army
faces Santiago is General Sumner's
brigade o.f cavalry a.rid Captain Grimes',
battery of the Second Artillery: The
ba-ttery is "flanked By .Colonel Woods'
brigade, embracing the Rough Riders
t under Lieutenant Colbnej Roosevelt;
i First Cavalry. Colonel Diet, and. Tenth
Cavalry Lieutenant Colonel -Baldwin.
Colonel Carroll's Second ..Brigade,
which is lost at present in the moon.-
[ light, will support the movement* to the"'
| left of San Juan. It consists of- the
! Third Cavalry, Major WesselFa Sixth
| Cavalry, and the Ninth Cavalry, Colo
nel Hamilton. General Lawton will
probably advance with General Chaf
| fee. General Kent's division will re
â  main in the rear. General ' Shatter's
headquarters are also in the rear.
It is understood the navy will make
a demonstration in front of Agruadqres.
The plain over, which the troops will
maneuver is abo- t two miles- long and
two miles wido; quickly covered with
great bushes, vines and cacti. The
I trails through it are very narrow. It
is with difficulty that -. two men can
I walk abreast, consequently the ad
i vance on Santiago will be slow.
There is no intention to rush the
I city to-morrow, but to occupy the ob
it-, tive point, which is the town of San
| Juan, and so to threaten the city with-
I in a quarter of a mile cf its walls.
Now, near midnight. General Surriner
. and his staff are making maps in pencil,
jby the light of a candle. Troops are
I still passing in the moonlight and the
lights of Santiago have been put out.
In. the- bushes of the basin beneath us
22,000 men are sleeping, buried In the
sei of mist, waiting for the day.

value of real and personal property in San Francisco.
Inasmuch as the Assessor aims' to come within 40

as' this percentage has : been frequently indorsed by
the State equalizers', it- .would seem that' an assess

THE FLAG f?ND THE D^Y. '*
REPORTS of victory from Cuba add an in
creased ardor to the enthusiasm with which the
people will to-morrow celebrate the anniversary
of our national independence. It has long been known
that the observance of the day would be this year
one of more than ordinary fervor. All over the
Union the preparations have been made on an elab
orate scale, and now that the public heart is stirred
with the. glonous story of American valor displayed
on new battle-fields there can be no question that
the day will be the occasion of a demonstration of loy
alty and patriotism beyond all precedent.
San Francisco being at this time the mustering
point of one of the great armies of the republic, and
the. port of departure of the expedition which is to
carry our flag to victory in the far off isles of the
Orient; will naturally be the scene of one of the
most brilliant and imposing displays of the celebra
tion. The troops encamped in the city will add to the
magnitude of the grand parade, and by their presence
will make it something more than a holiday proces
sion: They will represent patriotism itself and not
merely .a symbol of it. They are to advance the flag
in battk: as well as to- cheer it along the street, and as
they march to the music of the bnnds will exemplify
the ipatriotistn of war and the valor which makes the
flag respected all around the globe.
In the presence of these young men who have vol
unteer^ to go to whatever part of* the earth the ser
vice of their country requires them, even the most in
different to patriotic feelings and sentiments will be
stirred to something of genuine emotion. No other
flag, that floats under the heavens couUl rally in so
short a time so large a number of men to volunteer
in its service abroad. Few indeed could have found
so many to respond so quickly even to repel an in
vading army that threatened the home as well as the
flag. A lofty national pride will therefore thrill the
thousands that watch the volunteers as they pass, and
the applause will ring out for them as loudly as for the
banner that floats above them.
It will not be enough, however, for the people to
show their patriotism by cheers and pafriotic songs.
All citizens should display the national colors from
their homes and places of business. The city should
be radiant with banners. The red, white and blue
should stream forth everywhere until the whole at
mosphere seems brightened by their glory. The
streets along the line of march should be a continuous
decoration, as beautiful as patriotic, and the scenic
effects of the grand stage along which the procession
moves should be worthy of the high sentiments and
lofty aspirations the parade is to represent.
. On Decoration day General Barnes, with the felicity
of a true eloquence, addressed the Grand Army and
the Volunteer Army <"s the "army of memory" and
the "army of hope." To-morrow we are to celebrate
the nation of both these armies. It is to be an old
fashioned Fourth in fervor and memory, but a new
Fourth in aspiration and hope. Never before have
wo been so united as a people. Never before has the
grandeur of the .destiny of the republic been so fully
revealed. We should to-day prepare- Tor the celebra
tion to-morrow with earnest hearts. It is to.be some
thing more than a festival to celebrate past glories.
It is. to be a new dedication of the people to the cause

MR. BLAND "HESITATES.
BY the Democrats of the Eighth Missouri Dis
trict Mr. Bland, the rioted "Silver Dick," has
just been given a fourteenth nomination for
Congress. The platform, of course, contained a
declaration, in favor of free silver, and while recog
nizing the war to be a righteous one condemned the
bond issue and the increase of the public debt. It
appears, therefore, that Bland's platform makers, if
not himself, are desirous of defraying the costs of
the war with greenbacks, and have over bag
and baggage to the camp of the fiattsts.
More significant still is a report ttiat in an inter
view Mr. Bland declared himself opposed' to any fur
ther agitation of the silver issue during the coming
campaign. He is quoted as saying that while the
sHyer cause is eternally right, and the sixteen to one
ratio is unassailably correct, nevertheless it would
be inexpedient to push it to the front as the main
â¢political question at' present. He would wait until
the war is over before making another campaign of
Bryanism.
There will be no questioning the soundness of
this view from the standpoint of practical politics.
The result of the Oregon election shows what awaits
any party that undertakes to carry the old follies of
the Chicago platform at this juncture. The people
of the United States who voted down silver in 1896
are not likely to vote to adopt it as money now and
use it in payment of the brave men who are going
to the front to fight the battles of the nation. Since
it was rejected in a year that followed a long period
of depression and small crops it will not be taken up
now at a time when prosperity is returning and Eu
rope is paying us millions for our products. Mr.
Bland clearly is a wise man in his generation. He
knows when he has enough.
One of the commencement poets at Yale has been
accused of plagiarism and seems to be guilty. His
greatest crime appears to have been stupidity. He
stole a poem so familiar that he might as well have
claimed Hamlet's soliloquy for his own.
While there is no apparent reason for sending Cal
ifornia troops to Cuba, they are ready to go there
or anywhere else. The only hardship at which they
demur h the possibility of not getting to one front
or the other.
The plan to form a squadron to watch for Watson
seems to be another exhibition of Spanish short
sightedness. The safest thing for the Spanish to do
will be to keep so far away that they can't see him.
There is not much chance to protest at the sale of
German vessels to the Spanish, since an American
line, which professes to be patriotic and worthy of
patronage, did the same thing first.
Once more the rumor that Montejo is to be court
martialed has been revived. Perhaps it would be a
good plan to provide in Spain's articles of capitulation
against such outrages as this.
Besides demonstrating thot our soldiers are fighters
the war has shown plainly that the Cubans unaided
roi'.ldnot have conquered Spain, though the struggle
had gone on indefinitely.
Spr.in is said to be organizing a flying squadron.
Of what use it will he is not clear. If it will seek some
remote bay and anchor there no occasion will arise
for it to essay flicjht.
Â«.
Spain's view of the prospective visit of a fleet to her
shores is that this country is alarmcJ. However,
this country is not .".tanned: it is merely annoyed.
Spain has a monopoly of the alarm.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 3, IS9B.
THE ASSAULT ON REED.
1-N the attempt to keep party contention alive the
Bryan Democracy are just now viewing Speaker
Reed with aversion. His offending began with
.the Congress elected in ISBB, which met the first Mon
day in December, iBBy. It had a small Republican
majority and was pledged to pass a protective tariff.
The Democratic members publicly boasted that no
party measure should go through the House if they
could prevent it by breaking a quorum.
With this plan in view the minority sat silent in
their seats and refused to answer the roll call. This
went on for some weeks of the session, until one
morning Reed, against the advice of other leaders
of his party, counted a quorum by including the si
lent members, and legislation went on. The House
and the country, were thrown into a turmoil. He
was viciously denounced from the floor. Scenes of
high violence and potent passion were of daily oc
currence. But the Speaker, declaring that the House
was elected to transact the public business, insisted
that it should be done. It was all a parliamentary nov
elty and attracted world-wide attention. In that
way the McKinley tariff became a law in October,
1890, and the next month the Republicans were over
whelmingly defeated. The Democrats elected more
' than two-thirds of the members of the House and
had fifty over a quorum. The Republicans and Pop
ulists could absent themselves entirely and there
would be no check upon the transaction of public
business. That House showed the stuff that was
ir it by turning d>.v:i Mills, iis HUrrai icaaer and
chief by all rules of party organization, and electing
the pallid and insipid Crisp to the Speakership. The
next House, elected in 1892, was as overwhelmingly
Democratic, and Crisp was re-elected. It turned out
that this overwhelming Democratic majority and in
dependent quorum had not the manhood to stand to
; its duty and attend to the public business. Crisp,
; who had denounced Reed's rule for counting a quo
j rum, was at last driven to adopt it himself, through
a committee, and the country had the impressive spe
t?cle before it of a majority in the House, every
member of which had denounced Reed's ruling while
a candidate, compelling its own Speaker to adopt the
same methods!
Reed was vindicated. Men had said that he wrecked
his party in 1800 and in 1892, but the event proved
him to have had more foresight and courage than
any other party leader who had presided over the
House, and now a return to tine practices that pre
vailed prior to January, 1800, would not be tolerated
by the country.
No wonder that Mills left the House in disgust.
and that the weak and amiable Crisp pined and died,
unable to bear the burden of the difference between
party promises in dennncintion of Reed and party
performance in imitating him. There is the record.
It was made by the Matruire*; rind Champ C'arks. who
did everything but stick to their seats and their duty.
Reed's course was at first questioned and criticized
by his party friends, but he was vindicated by his
party enemies.
RANK AND PRECEDENCE.
OUR forefathers believed they had not only
founded a nation whose government recog
nized no class distinctions and conferred no
vain dignities of mere rank, but that they had formed
a people whose sentiment would be forever indiffer
i ent to such distinctions, and averse to such dignities.
I They believed the only distinctions among Americans
I would be those of official station, involving the per
j formance of public work, and the only rank would be
: that attained by service rendered.
This expectation of the founders of the republic
has been- fulfilled in the main, but not wholly. There
! are some Americans who think more of titles and
rank than of service, and unfortunately a very large
number of these have established themselves at Wash
i ington, where they exert a pernicious influence not
I only upon society, but upon the Government.
According to some well informed correspondents
at the national capital the passage of the much de
sired navy personnel bill has been delayed solely by
the influence of this class. It has mattered nothing
to the worshipers of title and rank that the engineers
and the naval staff generally perform as much work
and as useful work for the nation as do the line of
ficers. It has mattered nothing to them that the
efficiency of the navy would be greatly increased by
the reform proposed by the personnel bill. It has mat
tered nothing that a commission of experienced officers
of the navy have recommended the bill. They know
that the adoption of the measure would confer upon
engineers titles of naval rank which arc now the exclu
sive possession of the line, and that is all they care to
know. They are opposed to the bill and are fighting
it with all the power they possess.
The same class influence which for so long a pe
riod has prevented the passage of the navy personnel
bill is now arrayed against a measure proposed by
the House Committee on Military Affairs, providing
for the appointment of a lieutenant general of the
army by the President. It was believed at one time
that the opposition to this measure was due mainly
to the belief that Major General Miles would be the
man to profit by it, but in the bill proposed the Presi
dent is not required to make the appointment from
the list of major general.;. In spite, however, of this
free field g yen for all, the opposition continues.
Moreover, t is believed it will prove sufficiently
strong to defeat the measure altogether.
Thus it appears that class jealousies over mere
questions of titles stand in the way of important re
forms in the navy and a needed reform in the army
organization. With this illustration of what can oc
cur in a republic because of such feelings in the so
ciety of a comparatively unimportant city like Wash
ington, we can well understand how difficult is the
task of European statesmen in carrying measures thrit
disturb the social pretensions of a widespread aris
tocracy. It remains to be soen how long such an
tr.gonism can actually prevent the enactment of a
measure so universally approved as trie navy per
sonnel bill. It has been predicted that the bill will
not be passed at this session, nor r.t the next. Tf so
it will be a matter of general regret that we cannot
reform Washington society at the same time we elect
a new Congress.
Women have not yet learned to keep a secret. One
of the sex. required to pass a teacher's examination
and not having full confidence in her ability to do
so, got a friend to undergo the ordeal for her. It
was a good scheme, the question of honesty waived,
but the women had to toll about it. There oucht
to be other fields for such genius. The gold-brick
business still offers opportunities.

WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
Compliments to "Brother Francis,"
now running a confidence game In Oak
land, and will he kindly take note that
he is no brother of mine? The term
is used merely for purposes of iden
tification. I regard him as an un
washed and unregenerate rascal with
j the morality of a hyena and the saving
grace of a toad. He pretends, to heal
by the laying on of his filthy hands.
I commend to him the beauty of soap
and the utility of exclusiveness. That
the man is a wretched fraud is pal
pable. He deserves the hose, tar and
feathers, a ride on a rail. A person
having the gift of magnetism, and
through it the power to impart
1 strength to the invalid, may be in some
measure a beneficent entity. Francis
avers that his power is divine, and as
he operates on the credulous prays
ungrammatically and lies like a
; drunken sailor. It is strange that he
I can secure dupes, while even to the
! mind of the worldly there is a shock
in the blasphemy of the bogus prayers
! pouring from his lips. He affects fa
miliarity with the Author of all being.
j In ribald phrase he gives counsel to
! God. The average man has for the al
mighty force which set the worlds in
motion and. keeps them in their paths
I a reverent respect beyond expression.
| He does not always formulate Into a
set creed his notions of the Supreme.
He does not necessarily believe that the
details of each petty life are directed
by the infallible intelligence, or that
this incomprehensible intelligence can
be wrought upon by a maudlin peti
tion. God knows more than Brother
Francis does. He knows why the ig
noramus, coarse, unclean, repellent,
is permitted to take His name in vain.
Human judgment is that there should
be a law against quacks. Yet the
Francis creature, prating and mouth
ing and handling, is not wholly to
blame. The way had been made easy
for him by people seemingly gov
erned by lofty impulses and on certain
lines possessing a degree of ability to
think. I would not speak with disre
spect of Carrie Judd Montgomery. Her
good works are known and cover the
sins of her babbling and irrational
faith. She has a habit of descending
to the Jaws of death and being snatch
ed therefrom miraculously, to the glory
of her Creator. I do not believe that
any miracle was over performed in her
behalf. Ido not believe that God is en
gaged in the small business of adver
tising. Side-show methods are strictly
human. The woman is simply deluded.
She mistakes hysterics for the tumul
tuous working of the Infinite. The very
allegations she makes as proving the
goodness of the Master, could- they be
established, would demonstrate exactly
the contrary. If to feel the body re
lieved from pain is to experience more
than a blessing, is, in fact, to know the
appreciable token of a miracle, what
| epithet shall be applied to the cruelty
which permits the body to become the
tenant of suffering? If Mrs. Monlgom
i cry and her sort will apply to- this ques
! tion a mojety of common sense they
will reach the conclusion that the uni
verse Is built on a large plan and that
there are phases of it not to be meas
ured on the scales like a pound of
sugar. The ridiculous Francis and Mrs.
Montgomery are two exponents of the
same theory. For . correction of the
first the police ought to. be sufficient.
The second is beyond remedy, and it is
to be as much deplored as the other.
But for a Montgomery the harvest
would not be ripe for the sickle of a
Francis, and the charlatan would earn
his bread in the sweat of his brow or
go hungry.

For an evening paper to jump upon,
buffet, hit, strike and otherwise mal
treat the Cuban letter of Hearst was
not giving the amateur correspondent
a fair trial. As a matter of fact, the
letter might have been worse, and
many of Hearst's men have demon
strated as much. The striking point of
the communication was not its subject
matter nor construction, but the un
speakable conceit inspirine it manifest
in every line and between lines. Hearst
seemed to be exalted by the belief that
the world was holding its breath for his
verdict as to the conduct of the war;
that the univerFe had paused on Its
accustomed rounds while waiting to
know whether to praise or condemn.
Hearst gravely instructed it to praise,
and the planets, distinctly relieved, re
sumed the circle of their orbits. This
phase of the letter was absolutely
funny. How Hearst ever got to Cuba
without informing civilization in ad
vance, without blaring a horn or wav
j ing a banner, must ever remain a mys
tery- But since he has arrived there the
brassy bands of HearsUings have her
alded the fact as of prime importance.
It is wholly without importance. The
opinion of the yellow yeller could not
possibly have weight with anybody.
Whether or not he uphold the adminis
tration matters nothing to the admin
istration, its friends or foes. This idea
is far beyond the Hearst grasp. The
man is lacking in appreciation of hu
mor. He regards himself a mighty fac
tor in events, and is sincere in it. Peo
ple who think he laughs up his sleeve
over the comical figure he cuts do not
know him. He takes himself with the
utmost solemnity, and never cracks a
smile. His papers have ever since the
appearance of his letter bean modestly
printing encomiums ion it and the
author, these assuming to emanate
from official sources. For the most
part, the supposed utterances are
doubtless fictitious. For the rest, the
officials are asses. Hpaiit threw no
light on the situation. He only thought
he did. and in this theory found com
fort that does no real harm. Public

While ministers were, recently â  en
gaged in discussing' the reasons/attend
ance at church was so meager the. Rev.
W. vV/ Case interjected into the situa
tion a thought worth embalming.'. He
was of the opinion that, preachers
themselves did not stand by each other;
"If one strikes firmly out," -lie declared,
"and attacks some popular science he
is not sustained in his heroic action.
We need more martyrs in the pulpit
and few are willing to be ground under

lar errors."-It seems to- me this thought
lacks clarity; hence the .occasion for
embalming it so it may be studied at
leisure. I can see no reason why â¢ a
minister should reach" boldly out and
attack a popular science. The laws of
science will be found capable of sus- â¢
taining the attack indefinitely and the
assailant will find that he could as wise
ly bang his head against a stone wall.
In the Sermon on the Mount are to be
found a number of texts which may be
chosen as the seed of discourse with '

would suggest that - study it with a

evolve into new form. Meanwhile, how

nothing toward spreading the benign
gospel of peace. Of course "popular er

THE GREAT AWAKENING.
The nation will never be the same again
after this war Is- over. Something an
cestral and grand has been stirred to life
in it. The nation has passed through one
of those illuminating epochal momenta
that change the individual or national
character. It has caught sight of a larger
world, beyond the sordid mom^y-grabbinjj
circles in which it has trod. The old thrill
of great deeds and of constructive enter
prise has returned, and revealed a charm
that cannot again be forgotten in the
petty car^s of indoor life. Something
large and healthful has come into . our
national life â come from within ourselves,
and come to stay. We have somehow
awaken-'d to a true sense of manhood, and
are at last ready to take our place as a
nation r:mong nations. It is a grand thing
to set Cuba free, but in doing it we havo
ourselves attained to a gTander freedom
of national thought, and the- change
wrought in ourselves is by far the most
momentous result of the war.â Chicago
Tribune.

ABDICATION NO SOLUTION.
Sagasta was right in advising the Span
ish Queen Regent to refrain from abdi
cation. Her thowing down of the reins of
office and her departure from Madrid
would solve none of the perplexities that
surround the nation and would undoubt
edly look like flight. To be sure, she can
do no good by remaining in control.
Events have gone beyond her power, and
she is as weak aa a mouse in the paws of
that old cat. Chance. Still, her departure
or flight might do irreparable injury to
the dynasty, and thnt. is what -the states

admitted, that the Eighth has a field and

hoped to complete their work by now.
That their examination has been most
thorough is shown by the fact that not
withstanding all the men passed the pre
liminary examination, eighty-five have
been rejected in the eight companies in
spected so far. Having plenty of appli
cants to- pick from, the examination has
been as rigid as it is In the regular army
in time or peace, a.nd the slightest de

Mr. Fitzgerald has exhibited the blue
shirts taken from the Chinese establish
ment to a number of experts on clothing
and they have stated that the material
has practically no commercial value. It
Is made of some shoddy stuff and the
selvage is pressed In instead of being
woven. One good wetting would render
the garment unfit for wear. The way the
shirt is put together is slovenly in the
extreme, and those who saw it say it
would fall to pieces with little or no wear.
The Labor Commissioner will give the
shirt a special mention in his next re

years and has made a host of friends.
Had it not been for the breaking out of
the war and his belief that he should
give his services to his country he would
no doubt before long have made his mark
in the legal profession. Lieutenant Meg
gett comes from one of the oldest South
ern families, and his friends know that
If he is called Into action he will be a
credit to his country. Several years ago
he entered the militia and by active work
and study of the rules of war and tac
tics he became one of the favorite offi
cers. He has held positions in the guard
for several years.
I-ike many another young soldier, he
was a little impatient because his com
pany was not called into active service,
but upon the formation of the new regi
ment ne was one of the first to cast aside
his citizen's clothes and put on his uni
form. L.iÂ«utenant Meggett is now sta
tioned nt Camp Barrett. Yesterday,
while visiting for a few minutes in the of
fice where he had been so long, he was
surprised by the presentation of the
sword. The presentation was made by
Assistant Attorney General Anderson in
a few appropriate remarks, which were
seconded by a little fatherly advice of
Attorney General Fitzgerald.

concerned. There are â some who think
that as the State called them out, the
State should feed them. But no attempt
has been made to do this, and as a result:
they depend for supplies upon the Red
Cross and the fund provided by the City
Trustees.

THE CLIPPER SHIP TACOMA TO BE ADDED TO THE TRANSPORT FLEET.
UNCLE SAM Is after the fast Amer- ,
lean ship Tacoma, and the chances i
are. that in a -few days she will be I
added to the list of transports. She
was examined by Major Long last
Thursday, but as- very little of her cargo
of coal had been taken out at that time
a thorough inspection could not be made.
: In a day or bo nearly all her cargo will
havi?. been discharged, and then the. ves
sel will be again examined.
It is the Intention of the Government
to send a consignment of horses and
mules to Manila on the Tacoma. In her
lower hold she will carry stores for the
army and in her 'tween decks the ani
mals will be quartered. The vessel is
splendidly adapted for the business into
which she is going, being a fine sea
boat, -well ventilated and roomy, and a
"fast sailer. She 13 the first of a lleet of
sailing â  'vessels to be put on th>;
Ve.r;.h. for Manila, and the majority of
the. seafaring men on the front sa"y that
the." wind-jammers will make as good time
to the Philippines as the steamers.

PROTEST AGAINST
ANY EXTENSION
THE CENTRAL PACIFIC DEBT
SHOULD BE PAID.
The Committee of Fifty Strongly
Urges That the Law Bb Allowed
to Take Its Course.
At a meeting of the committee of fifty,
held in the Mayor's office yesterday, the
â  matter of the refunding of the Central
Pscific and Western Pacific ' debts, now
amounting to over $51,000,000, was serious
ly discussed. After a lengthy debate It
' vras decided to send the following dis
patches to the California representatives
at Washington:
SAN FRANCISCO. July 2, 1898.
At a meeting to-day of the committee of :lfty
at the Mayor's office we were lnati*U(*te4 to
protect against any legislation extending the
payirent of the Central Pacific debt: to urge
'on you to let the law take its coarse, which
means foreclosure If the debt )>i not forth
with paid." - -

Hon. James G. Ma^rulre and delegation,
Washington, D. C. : Please present the pre
test of the committee of fifty to the House
and conferees. We earnestly protest against
â any extension of time to the Central Pacific
r for the payment of the debt. San Francis -o
i has been successfully deprived by this corpo
1 ration and Its allies of a competing roa 1. and
we should Improve this opportunity to give
the city and State the benefit of independent
service, and at the Fame time break the mc
nopoly;." . JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.
A letter from John T. Doyle, protest
ing against any extension of time, was
re.^d and will be forwarded to Washing
ton. It is as follows:
!â â  The press' reports having announced the
] passage by the Senate of the House deficiency
-.bill with an amendment authorizing a com-
J mission of executive oftlcers to settle Lhe in
i-debtedneSH to the Government growing' out of
] the issue of bonds In aid of the construction of
1 the Central Pacific and Western Paclllc rail
â¢ mads, upon terms to be agreed upon with the
owners of Bald roads, we earnestly protest
' against said legislation as a distinct discrim
ination in favor of dishonest debtors, who, an
. shown Xxy the report of a Congressional com
mission, have already defrauded the public out
of millions and cruelly oppressed the people of
this Coast for a quarter of a century, and now
shrink from a determination of the sum due
by them by the courts of the country in the
ordinary cource of justice. We condemn it as
â  unjust, impolitic and a premium on dishonesty.
I Recognizing, however, in the condition of Con
! gresslonal business at the end of the long ses
sion and in the presence of a foreign war. the
Imminent danger of its passage as part of the
deficiency bill, wo earnestly entreat the friends
of Justice in the House of Representatives, and
.especially our own Representatives in Congress,
to at least secure tlw amendment of the follow
ing gross defects in the measure as It stands:
Firstâ lnsert a provision requiring the can
cellation or forbidding the confirmation of the
â  existing or any similar lease of the road to the
Southern Pacific Company, and requiring it to
be operated independently ns a competing road.
Secondâ Limit the time within which the com
mission must exercise its powers to the "first
Monday of December next.
Advance* made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan, 1017-1023 Mission.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 3, 1898.
Packers' Association and was only re
cently withdrawn from the Atlantic trade.
A year ago she was carrying wheat to
Europe, and then went to Puget Sound
with a general cargo. While lying at Ta
coma experts sent north by the Packers'
Association examined the vessel and ge
cided to purchase her. When the nego
tiations were completed Captain Davis
was sent north and brought the vessel
to San Francisco. Since then she has
made a couple of trips to the Sound un
der the association's flag.
When the Tacoma came here in 18S5
she was the finest American ship afloat,
and even now there are very few her
equal. She cost in the neighborhood of
$175,000 to build, and her equipment is of
the best. She is fitted out like a yacht
and her cabin is furnished more luxuri
ously than that of any other American
sailing vessel afloat.
The Tacoma is a three-masted skysall
clipper ship and was built at Bath, Me.,
by the Sewalls in 18S1. She is 173S tons
gross burden, 222 feet long, 41 feet broad,
29 feet deep, and as sound as a dollar.
DRIVERS COMPLAIN
OF BAD PAVEMENTS
SEBIOUS INJUBIES TO HOUSES
OF DAILY OCCURRENCE.
Sutter Street, Between Stcckton and
Grant Avenue, the Scene of
Many Accidents.
Vigorous complaint is being made by
persons who find it necessary to drive
either east or west on Sutter street, be
tween Stockton and Grant avenue.
Between the tracks of the Sutt&r street
railroad the basalt block pavement has
been worn smooth until it has acquired
the polish and slipperyness of glass.
Outside the rails the street Is paved with
the old style cobblestone, sharp as to
point and presenting the worst possible
footing for horses. ', St
The smooth pavement between the rails
is the cause dally of serious accidents to
horses. On Wednesday a well-known
physician was driving over the street, on
his daily round of visits. One of hla
horses fell and pulled his mate down with
him. A let of one of the horses waÂ»
broken, necessitating his being destroyed.
Owing to the steep grade In this block
and the great amount of traffic over it,
it is one of the most dangerous
places in the city.
It is not the only one with which fault
has been found. There, are many sucn
places on the Market-street system. The
horsemen are not the only ones who are
raising their voices in protests. The
wheelmen have also entered- their com
plaints. There are places ; where the
pavement has been laid, improperly, on
an incline. When the unsuspecting wheel
man rides upon these unawares a fall
is inevitable. This is especially % true if
the roadbed is damp from either fog 01
the recent passage of the sprinkling cart.
Efforts will be made to correct these
abuses, especially where they are flagrant
and imperil the lives of persons using:
them.
ALONG THE WATEB FRONT.
The Troubles of the City of Dawson
Transferred to the Courts.
The trouble between Birch & Co. and
the owners of the steamer City of* Dawson
has been transferred to the courts. Every
thing was quiet around the vessel yester
day and the unfortunate shareholders
who have their money tied up in the ven
ture have gone back to their homes to
wait until the matter is settled.
The handsome Now York pilot schooner
Thomas S. Negus is to make an excursion
around the bay and out to the heads to
morrow. She came here with gold hunt
ers and is a safe and speedy vessel.
Fire alarm box 15 has been put In at the
ferries and until after the Fourth one of
the fire tugs will be stationed in the ferry
Blips to answer an alarm of fire.
Bonds "Under Investigation.
The bonds of Elsie Williams and Grace
Loose, now under arrest for extorting
money from Captain Nevills, were under
investigation yesterday morning by Judge
Carroll Cook. Several affidavits were
filed by residents of Fresno County re
specting property belonging to the bonds
men of the defendants. Judge Cook will
take the matter up again on July 5. I
I The chances are that she will not be seen
in San Francisco again for some time.
| After discharging her cargo at Manila she
1 -will probably be turned into an hospital
i ship, for which purpose she is partlcu
i larly well fitted. "The Tacoma is just
the ship the Government wants," said an
old sea captain yesterday. "She will
make a fine transport and a first-class
i hospital ship. What they ought to do is
I to send her to the Straits of San Bernar
dino, between the islands of Luzon and
I Samar. There either the Brutus or Nero
j could pick her up and tow her to Manila.
! In that way the voyage would probably
| not take longer than forty days. If a tow
! boat is not used, however. Bhe will hayÂ«
to go by the way of the Rullingtangchan
! nel, and then she will probably take two
j months getting to Manila. The southwest
monsoons will blow from now to next
September, and In. the Ballingtang chan
nel she will meet with head winds air'
a very strong current. There she will
meet the nastiest kind of squally weath
er, and one minute will have a fine sail
ing breeze and the next a dead calm. If

the Government wants to make time I
think the Tacoma should be sent via the
Straits of San Bernardino."
The chances are that the big collier Tl
tania Will be added to the fleet of trans
ports in a few days. She brought down
from Nanaimo, B. C. a few days ago
over 6000 tons of coal and is now discharg
ing: at Port Costa. Yesterday Major Ruh
len, chief quartermaster; Captain H. Z.
Howard and F. C. Mills went to Port
Costa on the tug Reliance to inspect the
vessel. Captain Howard is the Govern
ment's superintendent of transports, and
Mr. Mills represented John Rosenfeld's
Sons, the owners of the boat. The big
Bteamer was found to be eminently fitted
for a transport. She will carry 4300 tons
of storos and coal in her lower hold and
room can be easily made for 1300 troops
in her 'tween decks. She can be got
ready almost as Quickly as a passenger
steamer and would be ready to leave for
Manila in a fortnight.
The Titania flies the Norwegian flag,
and if chartered by the Government she
will, of course, receive an American reg-
Istry. Captain Howard says she ig In
perfect condition and will be able to keep
up with â  the other transports Â«asi!y.
The Centennial is to be again inspected
by the Government, and the prospeets^are
that she also will carry troops to Manila.
She will probably go on the drydock next
Tuesday, and when she comes off it
would not take long to get her ready for
the expedition. The inspectors of hulls
and boilers have allowed her boilers a
pressure of sixty pounds to the square
Inch and that will give her far more
speed than the Government requires.
The Pennsylvania is now out eighty-five
days from Philadelphia and should have
been in several daya ago. On May IT she
was in Montevideo with her machinery
damaged, but on June T she was at Coro
nel. Directly she arrives she will be
docked and discharged. Then she will be
got ready as quickly as possible for the
Manila trip.
The â¢ work of getting the Puebia and
Peru ready has progressed rapidly and
now the workmen are to*ake a rest-un
til after the Fourth. There is no hurry
in getting them ready, as the date of the
departure of the next fleet of transports
is problematical.

was the game. After this brief Interval,
however, steady playing characterized the
work of both teams, save for an occa
sional wild throw, which in every instance
proved costly. Mr. Hammond's mistakes
of this nature should not be too severely
criticized, for he had an injured finger,
which should have been reposing in
Borne hospital. The one bright, particular
Ftar of- the game was Mr. Ice Cream Soda
Murphy. This individual played a per
fectly charming game at first; in fact, the
best that has been witnessed in many
moons. Jlis great catch of a foul fly was
tremendously applauded, and I dare say
will never be duplicated. His stopping of
poorly thrown balls was also greatly ad
mired. Keep up the good work. me

OTTS DEFEATED
BY M'MAHON
SPIRITED CONTEST AT THE MER
CHANTS ATHLETIC CLUB.
Meyer Knocks Out Hayes in the
Fourth Bound of an Extremely
Lively Bout.
The Merchants' Athletic Association
showed some first rate sport at Its rooms,
corner of Washington and Davis streets,
liist night.
The entertainment opened with three
round friendly bouts between Dahl and
â Cornell of the California Swimming and
Athletic Club, Manning and Lemon of the
Olympic Club, Mehner of San Francisco
ami Kickers of Los Angeles, the latter
being particularly, lively.
This was followed by a six-round con
test with decision between Meyer of the
California Swimming and Athletic Club
and Hayes of the Jefferson Club. Almost
from the beginning Meyer had the best of
it, as Hayes' wind gave out after the
first round. At the beginning of the
fourth round Hayes came up very weak,
Me < ding from the nose and gasping for
breath. In the middle of the round his
seconds threw the towel into the ring,
and the decision was given to Meyer.
' " The event of the evening was an eight
round contest with decision between Mc-
Mahon of the Merchants" Club and Otts
of the Excelsiors. Otts had a slight ad
vantage, being ten pounds heavier than
hits opponent. The two men seemed
evenly matched, however, and for the
first three rounds exchanged almost blow
for blow. Otts seeming to have whatever
:nh antago there was, as McManon's
wind was oor. In the fourth round Mc-
Mahon began playing almost wholly on
the defensive, and got in some heavy
body blows on Otts. He Is the more agile
of the two and cleverly kept away from
Otts 1 heavy blows. The hard, aggres
sive wurk told on Otts. and his move
ments finally became so slow that Mc-
Mahon could dÂ«rt in, deliver a blow, and
duck awa-- before it could ue returned.
At the end of the eiirhth round the deci
sion was given to MoMahnn. much to the
delight of his fellow clubmen, who car
ried him triumphantly from the ring on
their shoulders. Racy of the Olympic
Club acted as referee.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 3, 1898.
FOR FREEDOM
WON EASILY
The Great English Dog Is
Very Polite.
RAN AGAINST A LADY
ALLOWED MISS GAY TO SCORE
JUST ONE TURN AND A KILL.
The Winners at Union and Ingleside
Parks Will Meet To-lÂ»ay ;
and Great Sport Is
Assured.
Nothing very sensational occurred yes
terday at the big meeting which com
menced yesterday at Union Coursing
Park and will continue until Monday.
The talent retrieved the losses it sus
tained last Sunday, as the favorites, with
few exceptions, won the colors.
Many strange faces were seen in the
grand stand, attracted, no doubt, by the
announcement that For Freedom, the
great imported dog, would again appear
on the coursing sward.
The lungthy strider put in an appear
ance for the twenty-third course, and his
mate in the slips was Lady Gay, quite a
tolerably fast hound, but, of course. In no
wise to be compared with the dog of large
i bone and symmetrical appearance. Fifty
to 1 was offered on the invader, but al
; though tempting odds, only one sports
'â  man had the pluck to back Lady Gay,
[ and he received a holiday smile from the
! crowd, who, in chorus, sang, "One Moro
| Dollar Flung to the Windsâ One- More
I Dollar to Burn."
The pool-sellers, seeing that betting was
! out of the question, hit upon a scheme
â  by which they managed to reap a fairly
good harvest of golden eagles. They
asked if there were an'- sports who de
, sired to take a chance on Lady Gay scor
ing a point in the course, and on this
1 proposition several dollars were wagered
that the Lady would score and vice versa.
Even money was offered and accepted,
and those who backed the Lady cashed
their tickets, as she got in for a turn and
j the kill.
For Freedom ran a good race, but he
did not appear to be running with the
same dash that has characterized some of
: his past races. It is thought that Firm
Friend or False Flatterer may give the
champion a grueler to-day.
It was in the seventh course when the
first surprise to the knowing ones arrived.
Mira Monte, a small shortender, sent Lord
! Byron to his kennel/without a flag. Ben
dlgo disposed of St. Carlo after a no
course. Camila polished off Beauty in
nice order, and Lightning won a good
I race from Sarcastic. Dr. Norman gave
I poor old Waratah a bad beating, and, as
' a matter of fact, his owner. It. Scott,
opened wine. Since the doctor has been
engaged in scratching up grass and sand
at Union Park he has managed to win two
i courses, and he may be in the money yet.
' The fog rolled in during the afternoon,
j obscuring some of the courses that were
held just before train time. The following
is the order of the running yesterday:
Open ptake, first round, seventy-two entries-
Laurel wood beat Wildflower. Magnet bea

At Ingleside.
One of the larpest crowds ever at cours
ing- on a Saturday witnessed the sport at
Ingleside yesterday. It was the opening
of the firecracker work, to endure through
three days, and it was fully up to ex
pectations.
In the puppy stake mines exploded all
along the route. For some reason the
talent thought that Mac's Melody should
down Minerva in the first course. Mac's
Melody was never in the game. Lady
Jane threw the knowing ones down hard
in the open stake by losing to Clifton Lays
at 5 to i. Lass o' Gowrie also followed
it up by a loss to Leonora at 2 to 1.
The hares were remarkably strong, and
led the hounds a merry chase. In the
last course of the day Montana and
Benlcta Boy ran three "undecldeds" before
a decision could be reached. Montana
The running in detail was as follows:

Army Christian Commission.
The two great commissions during: the
Civil War werfi the Sanitary Commission
and the Christinn Commission. In the
present war the Red Cross Society takes
the place of the Sanitary Commission, and
the Christian Commission Is continued
and operated under the same auspices as
during the War of the Rebellion. During
the late war the Christian Commission
raised and expended over $5,000,000. and
5000 people were engaged constantly In
its work. The commission does not under
take to do everything, consequently no
medicines are kept In its tents at Camp
Merrltt. This is the work c. the Red
Cross, which is being most successfully
attended to by that society. The Red
Cross Society and the Christian Commis
sion are organizations within the army,
and consequently nearly all of their tents
are within the lines of the regiments. The
Christian Commission now has several
large tents at Camp Merritt. Through
the Inlluence of Major Hooper, who is a
member of the Christian Commislon. Col
onel Henth: r readily gave his consent
for a tent to be erected at Camp Bar
rett, Oakland, and the clergymen on that
side of the bay have already united in a
special effort to carry forward the work
at this tent. The Christian Endeavorers
and all other Young People's societies of
Oakland and Alameda have most unani
mously decided to co-operate with the
Christian Commission.
The large tent of the Christian Com
mission in the Montana Regiment will ac
commodate 1000 men. Students from the
t>cate University will conduct a service
there this evening. Evangelist Crittenton
will have charge Tuesday and Wednesday
evenings; Dr. E. E. Kelly will give a
lecture on Thursday evening; Chaplain
Stu!l will have charge Friday evening,
and Rev. O. C. Miller will speak on Sat
uruay evening. Services will also be held
In the other tents of the commission.
Sunday, July 17, has been set apart by
all the churches of the State as a special
day to present the work and take up a
collection -or the benefit of the Army
Christian Commission.
The next meeting of the commission will
be held at the Occidental Hotel next Tues
day afternoon, July 5. at 2 o'clock, at
which time very important business will
be transacted, and an official button
adopted. It is still hoped that General
Howard and D. L. Moody may be induced
to come to the city within the next few
weeks.
The new tent of the Christian Commis
sion for the Tennessee Regiment was put
in place yesterday afternoon, and the
drill which this regiment is to give for
the benefit of the work of the commis
sion will probably take place at Mechan
ics' Pavilion early next week.
DOCTORS DIFFER.
Two Boys Rejected by the Vol
unteer Examining Board En
list With the Regulars.
Alameda boys who are anxious to en
list in the volunteers are expressing much
dissatisfaction at the treatment rendered
them by Dr. Yost, the medical examiner.
They cialm he is turning away applicants
as physically incapable, who are in per
fect health.
Yesterday A. P. Heise and Corporal
Green of Company G, National Guard, ap
peared before him for examination. He
told Heise that he was afflicted with con
sumption, and claimed that Green was
suffering from tobacco heart; it is also
said that he turned away eight other
members of Company G, who have ap
parently been in good health. Heise and
Green were dissatisfied with the verdict
of the young doctor, and accordingly took
the iirst boat to the city. They success
fully passed an examination by an army
doctor at the headquarters in the Phelan
building and have enlisted in the regular
army. Green being assigned to the heavy
artillery.
The young men feel their position very
koenly, as both had counted on going to
war in company with their friends. As
it stands now it will be Impossible for
them to get into Company G, which 13
composed of the boys who have been
their neighbors, schoolmates and friends
fur year*, and they must either stay at
home or go out with strangers.
MERELY FOR PLEASURE.
The Officials of the Union Pacific
Are Simply Taking a Day
Off in California.
A special train, consisting of one bag
gage car and three private cars, having
on board a party of Union Pacific offi
cials, arrived here yesterday from Port
land and proceeded at once to Monterey,
where the tourists will spend the day, re
turning to-morrow morning.
The party consists of E. 11. Herriman
of New York, chairman of the Union Pa
cific executive committee, accompanied
by two daughters; Dr. E. L. Truedoau
of New York; Horace G. Burt, president;
Edward Dickinson, general manager, ac
companied by his son, Alfred Dickinson,
and Clifford Sadler; J. A. Munroe, freight
traffic manager; and E. L. Lomax, gener
al passenger agent, all of Omaha-
Messrs. Munroe and Lomax stopped off
in San Francisco and registered at the
Palace Hotel. "Our visit to California at
this time," said Mr. Lomax last evening,
"has no business significance whatever.
The officials came as far as Ogden on an
inspection trip, and the trip from ()K<lon
vi;t Portland to California and return
eastward is only a pleasure tour. Wo
shall go East on Tuesday evening. The
accident to our train near Delta, where
it was derailed, amounted to nothing be
yond a delay for a few hours."

A TOUCHING SCENE IN
A BRIGADE HOSPITAL
GRIEF AND REMORSE CAUSE A
VOLUNTEER'S DEATH.
Did Not vVish His Body Sent Back
to Utah and Cared for No Head
stone to Mark His
Grave.
A few days ago a soldier lay dying in
the brigade hospital at Camp Merritt.
He knew that death was near at hand
and was happy in the thought of it. His
story is a sad one. '
Back in a little town in Utah W. H.
Holcomb married, and the girl he won
was all the world to him. Happy in his
love and prosperous in his business he
became a well-to-do and' quite prominent
citizen.
One day there suddenly appeared upon
the horizon of his life a dark cloud. He
had learned that a well-known man of
unsavory reputation as to his behavior
toward the fair sex was paying undue
attention to his wife in a clandestine
manner. This information was as start
ling to him as a thunderbolt from a clear
sky. Not for one moment could he be
lieve that his wife was at fault. In the
shock he did not stop to investigate the
affair as he would probably have done
had he calmed down and coolly consid
ered the situation, but seizing a revolver
he sought the intruder of his domeatic
domain and killed him.
The murderer was acquitted, but his
acquittal did not restore his peace of
mind, and his cup of bitterness was soon
full to overflowing as the loved wife,
whom he had forgiven for any faults that
she mlftht have indiscreetly committed,
sicken*! and died.
Grlef-s 1 . r!cken at the loss of her whom
he had no fondly loved, and his mind
burdened with remorse at having stained
his hands with human blood, he was on
the verge of suicide, when the breaking
out of the war opened up an avenue of
meeting an honorable- death on the Yield
of battle in his country's cause. Going
to Cheyenne he enlisted with the Wyom
ing Volunteers, and coming with them to
San Francisco, his mental troubles be
came so worrisome that the result was a
fever of a typhoid character, which
brought on tuberculosis.
"Tea, Governor. I am going to die, and
I am dying rapidly, as you can see," said
the unfortunate volunteer to Governor
Richards of Wyoming, who had called
upon him, "and I rejoice that the end is
so near. I care to live no longer. You
know the reasons."
"Shall I send your body back to Utah?"
inquired the Governor.
"No; bury me here." said the living
man, his voice growing weaker. "I want
no one to know what has become of me.
I care not even for a headstone to mark
my grave."
"Is there no message you want sent to
your home?"
"No: I have no home.
"Is there nothing I can do for you?"
"Yes; take this picture andâ"
"What?"
The man did not answer. He was. dead.
The picture was that of his wife.

WINE MEN ARE NOT
JOYFUL THESE DAYS
THE RUMORED PASSAGE OF THE
NEW TREATY REGRETTED.
It Will Prove a Hardship to This
State â Fruit Men Partiall/
Favored by the Move.
Information has been received from
Washington to the effect that the Gov
ernment has practically concluded nego
tiations with the Governments of Onr
muny nnd Italy and will si^n reciprocity
treaties with these nations on the same
lines. as'the one concluded with France
a COUple of weeks ago.
The Italian reciprocity will have no par
ticular effect on the California wine In
terests, as there is not a great deal of
Italian wine consumed In this country,
notwithstanding the fact that that Gov
ernment has for a number of years main
tained a commissioner In New York
whose duties were to use every possible
means to Dromote the introduction of
the wine products of Italy In the markets
'of the United States.
â  On the other hand California will feel
the go'-'d and bad effects of the German
treaty, its this reciprocal arrangement
t&kes away one of the stumbling blocks
from the California fruit men in a num
ber of ways. It will permit the wide in
troduction of the fruit products of the
State into German markets under the
clause of the most favored nation.
Tlie products to be feared from Ger
many are of the kir.it known as German
"sweets." Manufacturers there will be
enabled to produce sophisticated wines,
which are mostly composed of potato and
beet alcohol, and get them Into this mar
ket at less cost than the pure products of
California can be sold for.
The protest of the producers of sweet
wines in this State is based on the fact
that notwithstanding they art- allowed by
Die Government to fortify their sweet
spirits duty free, and that they make an
excellent quality of such wines, their in
dustry is struggling for existence. They
(eel that if they had had an opportunity
to place the facts before the proper com
mittee at Washington their products
would not have been Included in the re
ciprocal treaty with Germany at leas'.
Whether or not anything can be done to
modify the agreement for the benefit of
that branch of the industry remains to
I c seen.
The importance of sweet wine making
In this State can be realized by the state
ment that last year's production amount
ed t,, about tM";'>.tÂ»oo gallons.
Charles Bundschu, a member of tho
firm of Gundlach & Co., and one of th-3
best posted wine men in this State in an
article written for the Merchants' Asso
ciation Review for this month Bays:
The- national policy of reciprocity as first
proclaimed by James O. Waine never contem
plated the uplifting of one Industry through
the destruction of another. The true Intent of
tho establishment of reciprocal relations with
foreign countries was to create a larger mar
ket for our products, without crushing- any of
our own struggling Industries. a reciprocity
treaty that would admit r>r.Â«ik-n goods bo low
as to close our factories, simply to find an In
creased market for American beef or pork,
would prove a suicidal policy.
Our Internal revenue tax amounts to $1 10 on
ever}" proof gallon of liquor r ntiiinlnft DO per
cent of alcohol; 24 per cent, therefore, pays
53 cents, while under the French reciprocity
treaty It Is now decreed that an Imported arti
cle at 24 per cent can reach the American con
sumer nt 35 cents, or IS cents per Rallon lesn
than the Internal revenue tax amounts to for
our own people. The absurdity of such a. con
cession to n. f orelcn country at a time when
war taxes are levied and Introduced on almost
any necessity of ordinary life 's simply beyond
conception.

FIFTEEN WORLD'S
RECORDS BROKEN
Remarkable Performance of Cyclist
McDuffle in His Race With
Michael.
BOSTON, June 2.â A1l world's records
from one to fifteen miles inclusive took
a sudden drop at Charles River Park
this afternoon, when Eddie McDuffle
of Boston defeated Jimmy Michael, the
tiny cyclist who has long: held the title
of champion of the world.
It is possible the race might have had
a different ending but for an accident
which befell Michael early In the race
while in the lead. His handle bars be
came loose and he waa forced to leave
the track for another machine, which
proved to be in little better condition
than the first. McDuffle had rained a
full lap during the transfer and as
Michael could do nothing with his new
machine he left the track, coming on
again after the machine had been re
paired, but not In any sense a com
petitor. He rode in all six and two
thirds miles.
McDuffle continued to reel off the
miles during all this time, cutting
record after record, until at the end of
the fifteenth mile and the race he was
20 3-5 seconds better than the world's
reoord, held by himself.
The men took their positions and at
the word were off like a Mash. Michael
caught his team first and opened up a
gap of forty yards before McDuffle was
well started. The pace was terrific,
and at the end of the first mile the
watches recorded 1:4(5 2-5 against 1:48
3-5, the former world's record, made
by Elkes in his race with Martin a
week ago. The two miles were ridden
in 3:24 3-u, a gain of 4 3-5 on the pre
vious two mile record. Michael had
added two more records to his credit
when his machine went down and he
was out of the race.
McDuffie here took the lead and the
killing pace did not abate. He con
tinually urged his pacemakers on,
and every mile clipped a second or two
from the previous record. The bell an
nounced the last mile of the race, and
his pacemakers exerted themselves to
the utmost as they swung Into the
stretch on the last lap. McDuffle pulled
out for a spurt and headed the team
across the tape in 26:30 3-5.

Any one who

Burr will under
stand !n a mo
ment why a re
cital of hie many
good qualities in
a prefatory way
Is unnecessaryâthe name tells the tale.
Amos is always ready to wish another
man joy whenever pood fortune smiles
upon him, whether it be a boy or a raise
of salary. When he heard of Carleton C.
Crane's elevation to the position of Pa
cific Coast agent for the Warner Palace
Car Company he simply let the reins go
and made it his business to inform the
community about this new honor thrust
upon Crane. About 2 in the afternoon
Amos rushed into the Palace lobby, and
there discovered a new lot to astonish.
He did so, and in no hackneyed way. Ac
cording to Burr, the first block on Mont
gomery street was flowing with wine. The
popping and fizzing of the molten amber
liquid, with Kb fascinating effervescence,
could be heard for blocks. Ills only sur
prise, was that the group of men to whom
he was pair, ng this word picture had not
heard the noise attendnnt upon the open
ing of fo many small "bots." He advised
them all to rush over to Crane and as
s-ist in the consumption of the supply.
One of the men, with tendencies anything
but bibulous, thought he would like to
experience something of Crane's hospital
ity, bo he went at finee. Darting Into
Crane's office he shouted: "Hello, Crane.
T hear that you are giving away small
bottles on the strength of your new job.
Well, cough up; am I in It?"
SMALL BOTTLES
FOR
EVERYBODY.
"Of course," said Crane; "everybody
get 3 a small bottle. Do you want yours
now or wia you wait?*'
"I'll take mine now." said the young
man. determined to drink it if he had to.
"All right," Crane replied; "here it is."
nnd suiting the action to the word he
dug down In his pockets and fished up a
small bottle of ink. There will be no ink
bought on Montgomery street for some
time. That was the twentieth that Crane
had distributed. And now everybody is
asking who is the jokerâ Crane or Burr?

PROPOSED PAVING
OF MARKET STREET
MAYOR PHELAN OPPOSES IT
FOR SEVERAL REASONS.
He Considers It Would Be a Waste of
Money Unless Certain Car
Tracks Were Removed.
Mayor Phelan yesterday forwarded to
the Board of Supervisors a lengthy com
munication bearing on the paving of Mar
ket street, between Second an Fifth, with
bituminous rock. He is of the opinion
that unless the Market-street Railway
Company abandon and remove the rails
on which horsecars are now run it would
be futile- to pave the street. The commu
nication of the Mayor is as follows:
,. ThÃ ,. Honorable the Board of Supervisors of
me City and County of San Franciscoâ Gentle
men: On May 11, 1898, the board let a con
tract for the paving Ât Market street, from
second to Fifth, work to be begun within fif
teen days. The pavement was to consist of
nine lnchea of concrete and a surface of bitu
minous rock, which was to cover Market street
mm the curb line to a point two feet dis
tant from the outer rails of the Market-street
Kallway Company's tracks. When the contract
came to me for approval I endeavored by per
?? n *l negotiation wllh the railroad company,
the Merchants 1 Association co-operating, to
na\e the said company agree to abandon the
outside tracks, over which horse cars run. The
rdin-oad officials conceded that they could, first.
i abandon the outside trucks without prejudi
cially affecting their monopoly of the street;
second that the horse cars exclusively using
tv? < \B/\ 8 /t d outÃlde tracks did not pay, and third,
that they would abandon the same in considera
tion of a franchise to usa overhead electricity
'>n Market street. This beint opposed, the
company refused to abandon its tracks, and
would not even consent to voluntarily pay the
part of the rua<lway chargeable to It by law.
viz., between its tracks and rails and for two
rc-et beyond the outer rails In the same man
ner as the balance of the street is paved.
Failing to set any agreement from the Mar
ket-etreet Railway Company 1 let the contract
become effective without my signature, desir
ing thereby to Indicate my disapproval of the
pavement of the street unless the unnecessary
outer tracks were removed and the whole pave
mentbetween thecable tracks and the curbdone
In a thorough and satisfactory manner. I am
satisfied that If the str.-t-t is paved as called
for by the contract now that It will look like
a patch upon our great thoroughfare, and that
it will wear as budly as the pavement on Fol
aom street, on account of the presence of the
outer tracks, which will afford teamsters a
groove in which to run In. Identically in the
same manner as is common on the narrower
streets, whereas If the outer tracks were re
moved and the wtreet paved to the cable tracks
a sufficiently large surface of roadway would
be made for teams to use, and, not being con
fined in a narrow space, they would travel over
the street in such a manner as would not be
destructive of the pavement, which would wear
evenly. Hence I conclude that unless the outer
rails of the Market-street Railway Company be
removed It would be futile to pave that street
with bituminous rock. You have extended the
time for the completion of the work under the
contract above mentioned to September 8 next.
If It is still the Intention of the board to pave
Market street with bituminous rock I would
respectfully recommend that you carefully con
sider the right of the Marki.t-street Railway to
maintain these objectionable tracks, and. If
satisfied that no such right exists, to order the
Superintendent of Streets to remove them as
a nuisance. A contract should â¦;nÂ»n be lft
for the paving of the balance of the roadway.
I herewith submit an exposition of the law on
the subject, which I believe to be sound, and
which clearly Indicates that the Market-street
Railway Company Is to-day illegally maintain
ing Its outside tracks. In my Judgment the
paving of Market street with bituminous rock,
unless these tracks arc 1 removed, will be a
waste of money, and the only opportunity this
material will have to show its merits. If It poe-
Fessses any on such a busy thoroughfare, would
be by the uniform pavement of the entire sur
face, leaving but the double cable tracks In the
center of the street. Respectfully nubmltted
JAMES D. PHKLAN. Mayor.
Mayor Phelan forwarded with the com
munication several excerpts taken from
the laws bearing on the rights and priv
ileges of street railway companies.

AMERICAN FOLKLORR-J. 8., City.
There is an organization known as the

FISHâ N., City. Science has demon
strated that fish are not cold-blooded, as
Is generally supposed. The normal tem
perature is 77, which is 21 lower than the
normal temperature of man.
A SHIP'S NAME-A. H., City. One of
the troopships that left with the first ex
pedition for Manila was the City of Pe
king:, not Pekin. The ship was so named
for the capital of the Chinese Empire, be
ing engaged in the China trade.
THE MONITOR AND VIRGINIAâ 3.,
City. A fine account of the naval fight
between the Monitor ar.d the Virginia,
commonly called the Merrimae, during
the Civil War is to be found in "Naval
History of the War," by Admiral D. S.
Porter.
ANGLO-SAXONâ S. C. Watsonvllle,
Cal. The use of Anglo-Saxon as applied
to the personnel of the army and navy of
the T T nlted States Is not 'incorrect, ' for
"in Its widest sense It is used In relation
to all English speaking or English ap
pearing people." That, ia one definition
given in the Century dictionary.
EXTRADITION TREATY-"Eureka,"
Mendocino County. The crimes that are
embraced in the extradition treaty be
tween tho United States and Great Brit
ain, in which is embraced Canada, were
published In the department of Answers
to Correspondents In The Call April 21,
IS9S. in answer to a query by Lucius.
BRONZEâ "Eureka." Mendocino Coun
ty. Cal. Bronze is apt to be affected by
a green rust. The hardness of and re
sistance of bronze to oxidation lit it ad
mirably for coins, and many ancient
bronze coins have come to us but little
deteriorated, though burled for ages In
damp soil or immersed in water. Bronze
does not rust in the sense that iron
rusts.
NEITHER MISS NOR MRSâ O. S.,
Oakland, Cal. A woman who has ob
tained a divorce and has been allowed to
resume her maiden name has no right to
use either Miss or Mrs., because not be
ing a marriecl woman nor a widow she Is
rot entitled to the prefix Mrs., and not
being a maid cannot be called Miss. If
the woman's name before divorce was
Mrs. Jennie Brown and the court allows
her to resume her maiden name, which
was Smith, she becomes Jennie Smith.
PROPORTIONS OF THE FLAliâ Mrs.
R. 8., City. A ten-foot American flag
should be five feet wide. The blue field
should be one-third the length of the flag
and cover the width of seven stripes. The
width of five feet should be divided Into
thirteen stripes of equal width. There Is
no rule for the size of the stars; that rests
with the fancy of tho maker. They must,
however, not be so large as to crowd the
forty-five, one against the other, nor
must they be too small so as to leave too
much space between. Any dealer in bunt-
Ing: will tell you how many yards of ma
terial you will require to make a ten-foot
flag.
A MATTER OF CONTRACTâ J. 1...
City. If a man rents a house, the manner
In which he pays the rent Is a matter of
contract, written or verbal, between him
self and the owner or agent. If the un
derstanding Is that the rent shall be paid
In advance, the owner or agent would
have a right to commence an action in
ejectment in case the tenant did not pay
as he agreed to. A tenant cannot claim
that because he paid the first month's
rent in advance ttie contract being rent
in advance, that he Is entitled to con
tinue occupying the house and pay In
the middle or latter part of the succeed
ing month.
MURDER NEAR BAKERSFIELDâ J.

ELECTIONâ "Eureka," Mendocino. Cal.
The name of a candidate and the office
for which he runs must be plainly set
forth on the ticket. The law of Califor
nia defines a ticket as "a paper upon
which is written or printed the names of
the persons he intends to vote for, with
a designation of the office to which each
person so named 1b intended by him to ac
chosen." If there should be an election
for three trustees and the law should de
clare that one shall hold for one year, an
other for two years and the third for
three years, the specified term should ap
pear opposite the name of the candidate
chosen for that term. If that were not so
it would be impossible to determine whi-ch
of the three candidates trie voter desired
should receive his vote for the iong or
the short term. A ballot that did not
contain the specified term could not le
gally be counted.

RIGI RAILWAY-P. A., Martinez, Cal.
The Vitznau-Rigi-Kuhn Railway in
Switzerland is operated by what is known
as the rack and pinion system. In ma
chinery this is a straight or very slightly
curved metallic bar, with teeth on one
of its edges, adapted, to work into the
teeth of a wheel, pinion or endless screw,
for the purpose of converting a circular
into a rectilinear motion or vice versa.
The Rigi road was built in IS7I by Riggen
back, Naeff & Zschokke. The road is
three and three-quarter miles long, rising
3P37 feet, the gradient being at first 1 in
14.9. .<*fter getting clear of the town it
varies from 1 in 5.56 to as steep as 1 in
4, the average gradient being 1 in 1.45. The
curves are all of the radius of 590 M: feet.
i The central track into which the toothed
wheels of the locomotive or carriage gear
is formed of two channel irons, each 4%
Inches deep by 2% inches wide, the ver
tical web being one-half inch and the
flange two-fifths of an inch wide. The
speed of four miles an hour can be at
tained.
THE CONFEDERATE IRONCLAD
MERRIMAC RENAMED VIRGINIAâ
I J. R., Nicasio. Cal. During the Civil War
the United States frigate Merrlmac was
at the Gosport navy-yard undergoing re^
pairs in April, 1861, when, it becoming ap
parent to the Federals that the place
could not be held, therefore it was aban
doned and set on fire, as was also the
Merrimac and other vessels, to destroy
them and prevent them from falling into
the hands of the Confederates. Subse-'
quently the vessel was rained, cut down
to the old berth deck, both ends for sev- â¢
enty feet ware covered over and when in !
fighting trim the decks were just awash:
On the midship section, 170 feet in length,
was built at an angle or 45 degrees a.'roof
of pitch pine and oak 24 inches thic-k;
extending from the water line to a'height
over the gun deck of 7 feet. Both ends
of the shields were rounded so that the
pivot guns could be used as bow or stern
ehafters or quartering. She was also-pro
vided with an iron prow 4 feet long for
ramming an enemy's ship. She . was
christened the Virginia and belonged to
no particular class, being a class pecul
iarly her own. After the fight with the
Monitor she was at anchor off Sewell
Point and the Confederates, fearing that
she would fall into the hands of the Fed
erals, destroyed her by blowing her up.

of a tablet in the front of the house
151 Thomas street, in which Lord Ed
ward, as he is familiarly known, was
arrested in May, 1795, and the chief
speaker on the occasion was the famous
Fenian leader, John O'Leary, who is
still hale ai.d hearty and the same un
repentant rebel to British rule that he
was in his youth, though he has not
been in agreement with all the methods
of the Nationalist party during the last
twenty years. Lord EdwarJ Fitzgerald,
it need hardly be said, is one of the
favorite heroes of the Irish people. "Of
the first family in Ireland, with easy
fortune, a beautiful wife and family,
two lovely children, the certainty of a
splendid appointment under the govern
ment if he would condescend to sup
port their measure" (the proposal for
the Union), to quote the words of Wolfe
Tone, "I ord Edward, instead of taking
the side of the English, took the side
of Ireland and, as the event happened,
gave up his life for it. Surprised on
May 19 in the house Just mentioned by
a party of soKiers headed by the no
torious Major Sirr, he desperately re
sisted arrest and in the encounter with
his captors received a wound which a
few days arterward proved fatal in
prison. It was no doubt better for him
to have died thus, for otherwise he
would have been hanged. The English
executive in Ireland at that time had
mercy on no one, and hesitated at no
means of bagging his game, and the
son of the Duke of Leinster would have
been treated, if he were even only sus
pected of being what was called a rebel,
in precisely the same way as any com
moner."
It may be interesting to note here
an incident which has occurred within
the last few days, and which illustrate
in a rather striking way the fate of
the descendants of one. at least, of the
chief Irish figures On the English side
in the great tragedy of 1798. Some of
the ablest, if not the very ablest, of
the agents of English rule in Ireland
at all times have been Irishmen, and
among the very ablest of those men
at the period of the insurrection and
of the union which followed was John
Fitzgibbon, Earl of Clare. He was a
lawyer who, by sheer force of talent,
went to the head of his profession, and,
then enlisting in the government ser
vice, obtained the highest offices in the
land by the unscrupulous sacrifice of
every principle of honor. He was more
merciless toward his own countrymen
who fell into the meshes of the-Govern
ment than a stranger would have been
under the same circumstances, and. in
addition to all this, he was one of the
prime agents in accomplishing the
Union which extinguished the Irish
Parliament and entailed a century of
suffering for Ireland and of trouble for
England. He destroyed his own coun
try for the time, but he apparently es
tablished the fortunes of his family for
ever. Not so, however, for in 1534 the
title of Earl of Clare became extinct,
and a few days ago there died in the
person of Lady Louisa Isabella Georg
ina, Marchese Delia Rocella, the great
granddaughter nnd last lineal descend
ant of the haughty Irish Chancellor of
a hundred years ago. while the family
mansion and estate of Mount Shannon",
near Limerick, passed some years ago
Into the hands of strangers. Sic tran
sit gloria mundi. The deceased lady,
I may add,- derived her foreign title
from having married General Carmelo
Ascenso â  Spadafora. Marchese Delia
Rncella, a distinguished Italian.
The movement for obtaining relief
from the burden of over-taxation to
which; Ireland is at present and for
many' years has been subject was
marked a few days' ago by a rather
notable meeting held in London imder
the, auspices of the London branch of
the' Irish Financial Reform Association.
The 'chairman on the occasion was Lon!
< â 'â a'stletown, and among the other prin
cipal persons at the gathering were
Lord; Mayo and Horace Plunkett. M. P.
I Tnent'i'n these names because they are
the -names of Irishmen who are not Na
tionalists, but, on' the contrary, are de
termined Unionists, as the opponents of
the Irish national demand for legisla
tive independence call themse'.ves. and
because their language was particular
ly outspoken in support of the Irish
claim for redress for financial wrong.
Lord Castletown, who is a member of
an ancient Anglo-Irish family and the
son of a- former representative of the
sma : ll borough of Portarlington in Par
liament,, is rapidly coming to the front
as a Jeader of public opinion in Ireland.
He. .created somewhat of a sensation a
couple. of years ago," at the commence
ment of th.c- financial grievance agita
tion, reminding the English Govern
rnent .and' the English people of what
had happened in Boston in the last
century when a question of taxation led
to the throwing of certain tea into Bos
ton harber.
"'â¢The. Boston speech" of Lord Castle
town, as: it has been called, has nat
urally excited, a good deal of comment
in England since its delivery, and it
waÂ« thought by some that the speaker
would. by this time have been intimi
dated .by the society in which he moves
both in England and in Ireland into
repudiating it. But he has done noth
ing of the kind, and in his speech at
the meeting with which I am dealing
he not only said that he had never re
tracted and would never retract a word
of what he had uttered at Cork, but
h^ urged the formation of "a Pan-
Celtic League" to fight out the finan
cial question. It is not too much to
say that if the Irish aristocracy ln gen
eral only took the line of Lords Castle
town and Mayo they would soon re
gain a considerable share of the influ
ence they have unquestionably lost. As
It is, I should not be surprised if both
these gentlemen obtained prominent
positions in the County Councils under
the new local government scheme in
their respective counties.
one of the most galling of Irish
grievances is about to be remedied. Up
to the present, if an Irish-born person
found it necessary to call for relief in
a. workhouse in Scotland he was Im
mediately sent over to his nativ^ place
in Ireland, to be there a burden cm the
local rates for his life, although he
might have spent all the rest of his ex
istence in Scotland. Or. the other hand,
a Scotch pauper ln Ireland could not,
under the same circumstances, be Bent
.back to Scotland from Ireland. For
years and years efforts have been made
to remedy this state of things, but it is
only now that they have resulted in
success. The present government has
Just carried a bill through the House
of Commons by which; for the future.
Scotland will be obliged to support
Irish-Taorn persons who. having labored
and spent their earnings there for the
greater part of their lives, may be
obliged ln their old age or in their mis
fortune to look for public relief, Just as
Ireland is compelled to do now in the
case of destitute Scotchmen landed on
h^r shores. It is to be honed that Scot
land will not feel herself to be out
raged.

TORTURE OF
TWO CUBANS

THE OTHER "DEGOLLADOED"
SPITTED UPON A SPANISH
BAYONET.
News of a Recent Insurgent Victory-
Brought to This Country by
an Envoy From the
Islanders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 2.â Captain
Nicholas Perez Stable, aid de camp of
the Secretary of War of Cuba, Colonel
Fonsterllng, has arrived here and was
in conference with Major General Miles
and the officers of his staff. Captain
Stable comes directly from the seat of
the Cuban Government, now at La Es
peranza, where President Masso and his
entire Cabinet, except the Secretary of
State, is located. The Secretary of
State, Colonel Moreno de la Torre, has
come on to Tampa, where he is stay
ing for a time with a sick relative. Cap
tain Stable wears the gray duck uni
form similar to that worn by the United
States officers. Coming directly from
the Cuban Secretary of War, he brings
much information as to the situation
throughout the island, and his visit is
intended to promote further co-opera
tion between the entire Cuban forces
and the United States troops.
Captain Stable says President Masso
and his Cabinet are strongly located at
La Esperanza, which is on high land.
They have temporary quarters and
have maintained themselves success
fully against frequent attacks by Span
ish troops.
Captain Stable reports for the first
time the details nf a hot engagement
which occurred recently. The Spaniards
numbered 4000, while the Cubans' de
fense was maintained by only 800. Not
withstanding this discrepancy, the Cu
ban loss was only forty-seven killed
and wounded, while the Spaniards left
thirty killed on the field, indicating that
their entire loss In killed and wounded
warn much greiter.
The Spaniards captured two Cuban
officers, a first and second lieutenant,
and Captain Stable says these officers
were subjected to the most cruel and
inhuman indignities. One of them was
placed by the Spanish commander in
front of a cannon and at a given sig
nal was blown to atoms. The Spanish
commander then called for a volunteer
to "degollado" the remaining officer,
this consists of thrusting a bayonet
through the neck of the prisoner from
one side to the other, penetrating the
windpipe. A Spnnish volunteer stepped
forward, and the Cuban officer was
thus subjected to the torture of a slow
death. Captain Stable states also that
two small boys not over 14 years old,
non-combatants, who were driving
cattle, were also killed by the Span
iards.
Except for these brutal atrocities the
Spanish raid on El Esperanza was fu
tile and the Spanish force finally re-,
tired, leaving President Masso and his
Cabinet still maintaining their seat of
government.
Captain Stable was accompanied on
his visits to the department by Senor
Quesada, secretary of the Cuban Lega
tion. It is probable that these confer
ences will result in a fuller under
standing as to co-operation when the
American army begins to make its way
west to the central part of the island.
TAMPERED T^ITH A WITNESS.
James Smith, a Printer, Has Got
Himself Into Serious Trouble.
James Smith, n printer, hns got himself j
into serious trouble, and yesterday Judge
Mogan ipsued a bench warrant for his
arrest, with instructions that no bail be
accepted for his release.
Last Sunday night he and a woman
j named Annie Bassett went to the room of |
! W. H. Harrison, a printer, in the Palmer ;
! House. Smith struck the woman and \
Harrison interfered. A fight followed. |
Smith was armed with a razor and Har- j
rison with a knife. During the fight Har- !
: rison cut Smith.and the woman was ar- j
rested on two charges of assault to mur
der.
The cases wore called in Judge Mo- i
gan's court yesterday, but Smith failed to
appear as a witness. The woman tenti- I
fled that Smith was the aggressor, and j
Friday he had told her to swear that ho j
did not have a razor, and they oould get j
money out of Harrison's friends.
The Judge at once Issued the bench i
warrant for Smith's arrest, and on Tues- |
day he will, in all probability, be charged ;
with a felony for inducing a witness to J
swear falsely.
FROM BAY TO OCEAN.
Market Street Railroad Company Has
Opened a New Through Line.
The Market-Ftreet Railroad Company
has added one more line to its already
extensive network of street railroads
through the city. The last addition tabu
lated on the company's chart is that of
the "Market Street and Ocean Electric
Line." This new line of street car travel
will be in complete working- order in a
few days. Since the old steam cars have
been discontinued on the south side of
Golden Gate Park, the roadbed on H
street has been transformed into an elec
tric line. This portion of the company's
work has been finished, and yesterday
for the first time a car was run ever the
road from Stanyan street to th^ ocean.
The Ocean Bench cars will start at the
ferries, and follow the Mission street
track to Fourth: thence to ElHs, to Tay
lor, to Eddy, and along that street to
Devisadero, Oak. Stanyan, Frederick and
II street to the Pacific Ocean. Returning,
the course will be down Turk street from
Devisadero to Taylor, then along Ellis,
Fourth and Mission to the ferries.

COLLEGE BOAT
CREWS RACE
Pennsylvania Wins the
Varsity.
CORNELL IN SECOND PLACE
REMARKABLE SPEED OF THE
WISCONSIN MEN.
Freshman Contest Won by Cornell,
With Columbia Second and
the Pennsylvania Crew
Third.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SARATOGA, N. V., July 2.â The
Freshmen and Varsity races of the In
tercollegiate Rowing Association were
rowed on two and three mile courses
respectively. The Cornell freshmen
won the first contest in 10:51 3-5, three
and a half lengths ahead of Colum
bia, who finished second, through a
splendid spurt in the stretch which put
her boat slightly more than a quarter
of a length ahead of the Quakers' boat.
Pennsylvania, pulling the only shell
used In the contest, won the Varsity
by two and a half lengths ln the re
markable time of 15:51r2. Cornell got
into second place after a lively sprint
with Wisconsin, leading the Western
ers nearly a length. Columbia passed
across the line four and a half
lengths behind Wisconsin.
The quadrangular race developed sur
prises, namely, Pennsylvania's victory
over Cornell and Wisconsin's heading
of the others all through the first mile
and her remarkably good work from
the standpoint of the disadvantages un
der which her members suffered by rea
son of a long journey so near the time
for the race. Columbia's place in the
Varsity had been so uncertain all along
that the finish was a surprise.
The freshmen rowed in almost glassy
water, but the Varsity crews had a
rapidly increasing south wind at their
backs, which accounted in part for the
fast time. The freshmen finished in
fairly good shape, but Pennsylvania
gave out perceptibly at the last in the
fight with Columbia. The Cornell boys
showed their condition by footing back
to their quarters, a distance of four
miles. The Wisconsin Varsity crew
had to row two miles to the starting
point for the lack of a launch.
At the finish of the Varsity raoe two
men in the Cornell boat required a dash
of water to enable them to keep their
seats. The Pennsylvania and Wiscon
sin crews finished strong, and the Co
lumbia eight evinced considerable ex
haustion.
The Varsity crews were at their re
spective stakeboats and ready for the
word as soon as the referee's boat
reached the starting place at 10:35
o'clock. At the pistol shot Columbia
took th? water first with a 36 stroke,
Pennsylvania second with a 40, Wis
consin third with a 38, and Cornell last
with a 34. Before half a dozen lengths
had been rowed the Wisconsin boys,
"with their "Yarda" stroke, had forged
to the front, and at the half-mile they
had a lead of half a length. Cornell,
which was trailing in the rear, put on a
spurt and was almost on equal terms
with Columbia, which was second. In
this way they reached the flag, which
they passed with Wisconsin a length in
the lead, rowing a stroke that was
pushing the boat through the water at
a terrific rate of speed. Wisconsin,
Cornell and Columbia were rowing a
34 stroke and Pennsylvania a 38.
As the crews approached the second
mile Pennsylvania went up with a
rush, rowing a 38 stroke, and before the
two-mile flag had been reached took
the lead from Wisconsin. The Wiscon
sin boys pluckllv held on to second
place, rowing a 34 stroke.
It was at this Juncture that the Cor
nell men were seen to "shoot their
bolt." Colson called on the men to go
after Pennsylvania. The men re
sponded with a will, but their reserve
force, which was so apparent in the
New London contest, did not show it
self, and while they got upon even
terms with the Wisconsin boys, it was
seen that the Quakers were bej'ond
their reach.
In the last mile Pennsylvania
skimmed over the water like a swal
low, crossing three and a half lengths
ln the lead. Cornell and the Wiscon
sin boys had a desperate fight over ev
ery Inch of the last mile for second
place, the difference being less than a
length.
Just before the start of the Varsity
race two or three Wisconsin men
sought bets that Wisconsin would fin
ish ahead of either Pennsylvania or
Columbia. Several such bets were
made, th? greater portion of the money
being wagered with Pennsylvania. One
bet was made that Cornell would beat
Wisconsin by five lengths.
Whipping Recommended.
Charles Schrieber. a boy 13 years of age,
was yesterday fined $50 by Judge Mogan
for battery upon John McEnerney, a boy
10 years of age. A few days ago, because
McEnerney refuse-! to dance at his com
mand. Schrieber fired a shot at him from
a toy pistol, and the bullet lodged ln his
cheek. Schrelber had terrorized other
boys in the Mission by threatening to
shoot them unless they did what he told
them. The Judge recommended his par
ents to give him systematic doses of the
whip for the next three months.

SALTING THE
MOUNTAIN MINE
Wreck of a Dazzling
Deal.
A SIERRA COUNTY TALE
THE JOB TOO HAW FOR THE
ASJAtfEB.
Why the Canadian Minister of Rail
ways Has Left a Famous Cal
ifornia. Mine to Fate
and Bats.
The famous Mountain mlna of Sierra
County and Its romantic history have just
provided another mining sensation.
A great Canadian company, with the
Canadian Minister of Railways at its
head, was Boon to burst on the world
with 600,000 shares and this great and
idle property, but the bursting has been
done by the promoters and their dazzling
BCh me. The end has come, because some
J4 ore samples were salted one night about
two weeks ago, up there in the moun
tains, and a well-known California min
ing engineer and his assayer were not
deceived, as some London people were,
with salteJ samples from the same mine
a few years ajju.
This is the property, once belonging to
the late Senator Mahoney, on which the
Bonanza Gold Mining Company (limited;
of London spent about #00,000 four or
five years ago, and then went to smash
without receiving a dollar, after the line
new 40-stamp mill had been running two
months. The property reverted, somehow,
mainly to George M. Pinney, now of Bus
ton, and the magnificent plant has been
idie ever since. The latest attempt to
sell and resuscitate the propery provlles
tae present story.
Pinney, it appears, recently associated
with him a mining tnginei-r and promoter
of New York, mimed Vun Blooten. For
mer manager Wild wrote a conservative
report describing the property and stat
ing that the ore would average $4 a ton
and could be mined and milled for about
$1 2j a ton. Armed with this and an ar
ray of other documentary evidence. Van
Slooten interested recently Hon. A. (J.
Blair of Ottawa, Canadian Minister of
Railways and Canals. It in said that the
scheme as finally worked out involved tne
organizing ol a company with 500,000
share*, ol which the promoters, vendors
and organizers should retain IMa.OOO shares.
Pinney wouici receive his share of this in
part payment for the mino, and besides
JtiO.yOO in cash was to be paid. But JK',OOO
1:1 cash was to be put up on the suirt.
With this working capital operations
could be resumed, and when the mine was
in full blast and the profits ur inonstrated,
the 2jl,iAiu shares would be issued and
1 on the market. Minister Khiir in
terested some other Canadian capitalists,
but was the principal Investor. The prop-
D appeared inviting and legitimate
to the Canadians and so far there appears
nothing to be greatly criticiz d.
Everything w_a.s agreed to, and about
three weeks ago there arrived here with
Messrs. Pinney, Van Slooten and Wild,
the Hon. P. P, Thompson, M. P., of Fred
erickton, New Brunswick, who came as
the financial agent of Minister Blair with
the money which was to be paid if repre
sentationa were true. Mr. Thompson se
lected as a mining engineer to represent
the Investors, H. E. Tibbitts, the well
known Californian, now of Sa.n Francisco
and Redding, and for many years of Ama
dor County. The rest or the story Mr.
Tibbitts tells as follows:
"I went to Sierra County with Mr.
Thompson about twu weeks ago. I select
â¢ â¢'1 as my assayer Mr. Hudson of Grass
Valley, an honest and competent man,
and placed him in the company's assay
oflice. 1 selected three men there to work
with me in the mine taking samples. Two
weeks ago Monday I had twenty-six sam
ples sacked and sealed and left them In
the assay office over night, Instructing my
assayer to use extreme care and report
to none but me. On Wednesday evening
he had five samples pulverized and ready
for a lire test, but as It was late, said
he would not start the fire. I told him
not to let it occur again, and to leave
the samples fn that he would know if
they were tampered with.
"Each sample was pilf-d rone-Phased In
a pan. and one of my tags was buried In
the middle. Next morning he tod me the
samples had been tampered with. The
shape was changed and the tags mis
pi ced. I took one sample and simply
panned it out. It went $250 to the tori.
Two others I panned with a similar re
sult. I found In them coarse gold, fine
gold and smooth gold, much of which was
too h\g to go through the seventy-mesh
screen Mr. Hudson had used. I sealed up
the other two samples, and when my
partner, Mr. Carson, assayed them at
Redding one went $28fi and 'the other $103
Jo the ton. All around, it was as 'raw' a
Job of salting as I ever heard of.
"I reported to Mr. Thompson, and a lot
of telegraphing to Ottawa was done. I
wouldn't have anything to do with the
twenty-one unpulverized samples, and
proposed bringing there men or my own
and taking new samples. I proposed a
two weeks' washing test with ten stamps,
but there seemed to be objections to these
propositions. We telegrp.phed tr> Price in
San Francisco about assaying 100 samples,
but while all this and more was going on
a t< !<-pram from Ottawa said that things
looked too suspicious and directed us to
drop the whole thing, It was dropped
right there.
"i wrote a report of what 7 had loarned
of the mine and T regret that I could not
have made reliable tests. I did not con
demn the property, but my report was
rather unfavorable as far as it went.
Then' ar^ nearly 101.000 tons of ore blocked
out, and I think it can be mined and
milled for from 81 75 to $2 a ton. I don't
know anything about who did the salt
ing and have made no charges."
That Krcat Canadian company will never
be floated. The watchman at the Moun
tain mitK- will resume his vigils. Another
mine salting story has been told and an
other chapter ol Mountain mine history
written. The midnight job in the assay
office up in the mountains wrecked an
other chance that that splendid mill would
cease its rusting.
DUFFIELD'S FORCE
CHECKED BY THE
SWOLLEN RIVER
Copyrighted, 189S, by the Associated Press.
WITH THE ADVANCE OF THE
THIRTY-THIRD MICHIGAN, in front
of Aguadorcs, Friday, July 1, noon (by
the Associated Press dispatch boat
Dandy, via Port Antonio and Kingston,
Jamaica, July 2, delayed in transmis
sion). â The American fleet has been
shelling the fort and rifle pits of
Aguadores all the morning. The
Thirty-third Michigan Volunteers took
a train at Juragua in two divisions, the
first at 5 a. m.. and the second at 7:15
a, m. The rickety engine ran the six
miles in about an hour and stopped a
mile and a half from the fort, out of
sight.
General Duffleld, commanding the
land forces, signaled to the New York
to begin firing at 8:30. The New York
anil the Suwanee advanced to about
2000 yards distant from th? fort. The
Suwanee, with three successive "^ots,
knocked the Spanish flag off the fort,
wrecked cmc corner of the structure and
shot away the staff.
The Cubans and the Thirty-third
threw out skirmishers on the hill and
shots were exchanged all the morning
with the rifle pits. The fort and the
blockhouse were both silenced biÂ» the

niea marched up the railroad track and
another force went around the beach
out of sight of the Spanish forts. Six
small eheUo were thrown over the
heads cf the men too close for comfort
and the troops were sent to cover un
der the e:nbankment in the ru.lhoad
cut.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon the engine
was forced to return for watbr. On
the first trip half the command were
brought tuck and the train returned
for the others. It develops that this
attack was merely a diversion in favor
of Genera) Lawton's movement around
the right (lank. It Is Impossible to take
Aguadorea as the river Is unCurdablcs
arid the Spaniards have blown up the
far end of the railroad bridge. Only
Companies i>, D and H took part in
the action, owing to the limited spaca
where the men could be deployed.
The killed thus far were all the vic
tims of the first shells fired by the
Spaniards, who had the line of range
of the railroad, though the firing was
high. The men had just thrown off
their packs when a shell from a three
inch cannon exploded in the ranks of
Company L. The killed were:
John Franklin of Diamondale, Mich.
Ferdinand Seabright.
The wounded were:
Frank Lawson of Lawson, Mich., left
arm fractured.
D. A. Stark, Ann Arbor, Mich., right
arm fractured.
Clifford H. Curtis of Land Lake.
All the killed and wounded were
members of Company L, which was
made up of Sons of Veterans.
As the train left a second shell ex
ploded on the track wounding a num
ber of others.
LAST MOMENTS OF
THE HEROIC GRIDLEY
"The Battle of Manila Killed Me, but
I Would Do It Again if
Necessary."
ERIE, Pa., July 2.â The first authen
tic details surrounding 1 the last mo
ments on earth of Captain Charles V.
Gridley have been received here in a
letter from Paymaster Gait, who had
been assigned to care for the invalid
and to bring him home. The letter
states that Captain Gridley had been
ill for several weeks before the fight
and arose from a sick bed to assume
his duties on that glorious day. He
remained on duty continuously, though
suffering from a rupture, which was so
aggravated that frequent hemorrhages
occurred.
After the battle he was ordered home.
The band of the Olympla played "Auld
Lang Syne" as the commander left his
ship, never again to return.
Cm the Coptic, en route to "okohama,
the ship s surgeon informed him that
the hemorrhages would result in death.
The captain, with unshaken fortitude,
replied:
"The battle of Manila killed me, but
I would do it again if necessary."
Twenty-four hours before death en
sued he iapsed into unconsciousness,
aftf-r sending loving messages to his
wife and children.
ARTILLERY SHAFTER
ASKED FOR HAS NOT
STARTED EVEN YET
NEW YORK, July 2.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Al
though it was thought by officials in
the War Department that six trans
ports loaded with artillery, infantry
and horses for the cavalry left Tampa
on June 30 information has been re
ceived here to the contrary.
Shortly after Major-General Shafter
arrived in Cuba he wired to the Gov
ernment for additional batteries of ar
tillery. These he considered were nec
essary in the campaign before Santi
ago. The artillery force at Tampa, un
der command' of Brigadier General
Randolph, was supposed to have left
for Santiago on June 30. but now It is
known it will not leave until some
time to-morrow. Only one regiment,
the Illinois, h:.s as yet left Tampa to
re-enforce General Shafter.
The delay In get l - the artillery force
off to Santiago seems to the army offi
cers in Washington to be most unac
countable. Tt spoms, according to a
dispatch received from Tampa, that the
delay is partly due to the English
crews on the trar sports.
It will now be impossible for this ar
tillery force to reach Santiago before
Tuesday of next week. By that time,
it is hoped, Santiago will have fallen.

LEARY OF THE TIVOLI IN "FORT FRAYNE."
The Popular Comedian Will Play the Irish
Corporal-Other Changes.
Beginning with the matinee performance on Monday afternoon at the
Columbia Theater, there will be a decided change In the cast of "Fort

the role of the Irish corporal, and it is expected that he will make a big suc
cess in the part. Frawley has also arranged to have Theodore Roberts ap

played by John T. Burke. Roberts will have an opportunity in his new role
to portray a character not unlike the one in which he won special favor in
"The Heart of Maryland." Some of the scenes of the play have been gone
over and quicker action in various places is expected to result. The man
agement's object in making these and other changes, although the produc
tion haw been drawing good houses, Is Frawley's proposition to send the new
play to New York. He is making every possible test in the Interpretation of
the various roies and scenes, so as to get the truest value out of them to
guide himself when he selects his metropolitan cast.
but, instead of heaving to, the sloop
scudded ahead into shoal water, where
the little gunboat could not follow.
Ensign Ellis and six sailors gave
chase in a small boat, armed as the
exigencies ol the situation would per
mit, and ran her down after a pur
suit "of six miles, pulling against the
wind and a strong tide. A couple of
shots at close range brought the sloop
to terms and she was boarded.
The pilot dove overboard and swam
ashore.
The sloop, which was flying both the
Haytien and British flag, carried a
crew of twelve men and was laden to
her full capacity with provisions, con
sistlngly largely of flour.
CHICAGOANS DEPRIVED
OF DAILY NEWSPAPERS
Proprietors Confident That They Will
Triumph Over the Striking
Stereotypers.
CHICAGO, July 2.â None of the English
papers were published in Chicago to-day,
owing to the strikÂ« among the stereotyp
ers. The latter demanded a reduction in
the hours of labor and an Increase In
wages. It was refused, find as a result,
at 8 o'clock last night the stereotypers re
fused to X" to work.
The following newspapers have entirely
suspended publication, pending a settle
ment of the issue: Times-Herald, Rec
ord, Tribune, Chronicle, Inter Ocean,
E" :-ning Post, Daily News, Evening Jour
nal and Dispatch.
A n.-;etine of the publishers was held
at 11 o'clock this morning to arrange a
plan of campaign, and to provide for the
resuming of publication at the earliest
moment, and it was announced that no
paper could be published to-morrow
morning. The publishers are acting to
gether and will do so. Already they have
rreeived a lHrge number <>. applications
from stfreotypers in other cities, and It
is the gt neral belief that e l nco only about
200 employes are directly involved, the
suspension will not be for long. An im
mediate influx of stereotypers from other
cities Is expected, and has in sornt; meas
ure begun. The Intense interest in the
battle at Santiago renders the situation
a peculiar one. and this fact was undoubt
edly seized upon by the operatives. There
is no little public feeling aroused against
the operatives because of this phase of
the case.
MAY REACH VOTE
DURING COMING WEEK
When the Senate Figures Upon Dis-
posing of Hawaiian Annexa-
tion Resolution.
WASHINGTON, July 2.â There is a
prevailing opinion in the Senate that
a vote win be reached on the Hawaiian
annexation resolutions some time dur
ing the coming week. The opponents
of the resolution state that a vote is
impossible next week, and say that at
the inside limit the debate will run a
week from next Wednesday.
The contest seems to have settled to
this situation: If the friends of annex
ation are able to maintain a quorum
until the end of the week it is probable
that the opponents will consider fur
ther opposition of a filibustering na
ture useless, and some arrangements
for a vote will be reached. The first
admission of any kind by the opposi
tion that the end was in sight was a
partial assent to the suggestion that a
vote might be taken after ten days'
more debate. It has been believed by
the opposition that after the appro
priation bills were passed a quorum
could not be maintained. These bills
are practically out of the way now, as
the deficiency bill will probably pass
Tuesday.
Next week will determine the staying
powers of the annexationists. When it
is demonstrated that a quorum will
stay, then it is expected the opposition
will yield and a vote be taken.
HAWAIIAN DEBATE
IN THE SENATE
Pettigrew Declares the Sugar Trust's
Interest Is With Annexa
tion.
WASHINGTON, July 2.â To-day's ses
sion of the Senate was devoted chiefly to
the Hawaiian debate, Senator Pettigrew
of South Dakota occupying five hours.
An effort was made to secure an agree
ment to adjourn until Wednesday, but
Davis, in charge of the resolutions, de
clined to listen to the proposition unless
an agreement to vote next week upon the
resolutions could be entered.
This White, to whom Davis addressed
himself, said he considered impossible.
Turning to the Republican members
constituting the major part of the an
nexation support, Pettigrew criticized
them for their silence and charged them
with being "bulldozed" In keeping their
lips closed when a great question was
before the Senate. The administration, he
asserted, had demanded that annexation
be accomplished, and Senators were so !
under its control that they dared not open
their mouths for ftar they would cause
delay and incur thj President's displeas
ure. He said the sugar trust's interest
was with annexation.
"We all know what Senators on this
floor have been in the past," he declared,
"friends of the sugar trust, and now
every one of them is in favor of annexa
tion. That in itself is sufficient answer
to their miserable contention."
Hale of Maine presented a partial report
of the conferees upon the general de
ficiency bill, which was adopted without
debate.
At 5:23 p. m. the Senato adjourned to
Monday.
FOREST FIRES RAGING
NEAR MICHIGAN BAR
Damage From the Flames Will Reach
Weil Into the Thousands
of Dollars.
SACRAMENTO, July 2.â One jf the
most serious forest fires that was ever
known in that locality swept through
the vi-inity of Michigan Bar yesterday
afternoon.
The loss ran up in the neighborhood
of $10,000, while no one can estimate
the damage done to the grazing ranges
which abound in the territory covered
by the conflagration. Thousands of
cords of wood were destroyed and
miles of fence were reduced to" ashes.
Cattle and horses perished in the
flames. Birds and animals in the forest
came in droves to the open and many
of them could not survive the stifling
fumes which sattled over the locality of
the fire in clouds so dense that the rays
of the sun were completel obscured.
The fire is still raging and at last ac
counts had passed into the chaparral
of Amador Count - and was making its
wa toward Plymouth.
BRAKEMAN KILLED
IN A FREIGHT WRECK
REDDING, July2.~ As the regular north
bound freight train was speeding along
near Morley to-day the engine Jumped the
track and the cars were piled upon it.
Gus Edwards, a brakeman, was killed,
and the engineer, the fireman and another
brakeman injured, although not seriously.
The wrecking train from Dunsmuir and
a special from Redding left immediately
for the scene to clear away the wreck
age. It is thought that traffic will be
delayed at least seven hours.
This wreck was the second in two days
on the same section of the road. In both
cases the engine loft the rails.
GENERAL DEFICIENCY BILL.
WASHINGTON. July 2.-The conferees
on the general deficiency bill reached an
agreement to-day on everything except
the Pacific railroads amendment. Chair
man Cannon had promised a vote in the
House on this matter before an agree
ment was made. The principal Items of
amendment which remain in the bill are:
The Canadian Commission: relating to the
compensation of gangers of spirits; re
lating to the government of soldiers'
homes; to pay forest inspectors $100,000;
payment of boards of townsite entries in
Oklahoma.
All Senate amendments for the war and
navy are retained in the bill; also all
certified claims. The Senate amendment
appropriating $145,000 for the purchase of
land adjacent to and dredging the entrance
of Pearl Harbor was eliminated. The im
pression is that the Pacific railroads
amendment will bo agreed to in the
House which, with the adoption of the
conference report, would pass the bill.
NORMAL SCHOOL CHANGES.
SAN JOSE, July 2.â The trustees of the
State Normal School, at the quarterly
meeting to-day, decided*to add a kinder
garten department to the institution, and
elected Miss Meredyth Woodward of the
Chicago Kindergarten College as director
of the department.
Miss Kate Cozzens and H. H. Howe,
teachers of mathematics, were not re
elected to the faculty. The resignation of
Miss Sarah E. Miller as preceptress was
accepted, and Miss Elizabeth McKlnnon
was elected to the position.
A resolution was adopted thanking Mrs.
M. P. O'Connor for the magnificent art
collection given to the city and school on
condition that the latter care for it.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Koonan. 1017-1023 Mission.

BIG DEALS iN PROSPECT.
MEANING OF THE COMING OF
OFFICIALS.
Belief That the Oregon Short Line
and Navigation Company

Absorbed.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
DEL MONTE, July 2.â The Union
Pacific Railroad is destined to become
one of the greatest in the West in the
very near future. The board of man
agement that took control after the
termination of the series of receiver
ships through which the road passed
last year is a virile one, and a policy
of aggression will be pursued until the
company is its former self, with^even
an accretion of additional strength in
the way of new properties.
The visit of the Union Pacific officials
to this coast is full of import. Start
ing from Omaha the party, -which comp
rised E. H. Harriman, chairman of
the executive committee; E. Dickin
son, general manager; J. B. Berry,
chief engineer; President H. G. Burt,
General Passenger Agent Lomax and
Freight Traffic Manager Munroe, pro
ceeded along the Union Pacific and
Oregon Short Line to Portland and
thence to Del Monte. Messrs. Lomax
and Munroe left the party at Oakland
and went to San Francisco to transact
business with the Southern Pacific
concerning their departments.
The trip from Omaha to Portland
j was fraught with business of great
railroad importance. A very minute
I inspection of the Oregon Short Line
i and the Oregon Railroad and Naviga
| tion Company line was made.
The presence of E. H. Harriman in
the party is significant. Mr. Harriman
is a man of wealth and represents
large New York interests. To him falls
the formation of combinations among
the various lines which are contiguous
to or connected with the Union Pacific
In any way.
President Burt, though strong in the
asseveration that the Union Pacific has
not formulated any definite plan to con
trol the Oregon Navigation Railroad
and the Oregon Short Line, admits that
arrangements have been perfeccci
tending to a strong alliance between
the Union Pacific and those lines. The
present tour of the Union Pacific mag
nates has been productive of this alli
ance, which in fact is of more conse
quence than the mere formation of an
alliance. It foreshadows the resump
tion of old conditions. The Union Pa
cific is moving outward for other prop
erties, and everything that can be ac
complished In the way of railroad ag
grandizement by the officials now in
charge will be done.
From the present outlook the Mon
tana Union line will soon be a branch
of the Union Pacific, and it is expected
that by November of this year the lat
ter line will have in its control the most
two desirable properties of the North
west, the Oregon Short Line and the
Oregon Navigation and Railway Com-
The railroad magnates at Del Monte
assert that the business of the trip was
consummated when Portland was
reached. Fror.. that place the journey
through California was one solely of
pleasure. They will return to San
Francisco on Monday morning. E. H.
Harriman, chairman of the executive
committee of the Union Pacific, said
to-night:
"Our trip to San Francisco is one of
pleasure, with an undercurrent of busi
ness. The Union Pacific owns one-half
the stock of the Occidental and Oriental
Steamship Company, and while in San
Francisco we will look into the affairs
of the Occidental and Oriental."
The Southern Pacific and the I T nioh
Pacific divide the stock of the Occiden
tal and Oriental Sceamship lines between
them, and thus the two big railroad
companies of the West will be brought
together in a conference. Mr. Harri
man continued:
"Of course we will lock out for all
our interests with connecting lines. As
the Union Pacific has, large coast Inter
ests it is probable that an annual trip
will be made to San Francisco on a tour
of inspection."
It is rumored the Union Pacific will
combine the freight and passenger
agencies in one of the cities on the
coapt in order to retrench. This is in
consonance with the spirit of retrench
ment concerning unnecessary expenses
that the Union Pacific intends to follow
out in the future.

ST. PAUL'S HOME AT FRUITVALE
An Elaborate Entertainment to Be Given at the
Residence of Mr. and Mrs. Menge for
Charity's Cause.
OAKLAND, July 2.â Very, elaborate arrangements have been made for
the musicale and garden party at the beautiful grounds and home of Mr.
and Mrs. Menge at 1450 Fruitvale avenue next Monday. This party is for
the benefit of the Sisters of St. Joseph and other charities. The lovely
grounds have been specially decorated and will be brilliantly illuminated in
the evening.
St. Paul's Home, as the place is called, is one of the most picturesque re
sorts in Alameda County, and is so situated as to be an ideal place for a
social garnering. On Monday, from 2to 10 p. m., the home and gardens will
be thrown open to guests and refreshments will be served by a corps of
young ladies. At the afternoon entertainment Miss F. Bechtell, Misses K.
and E. Barsell. Miss Emma Menge and Miss Dora Schlaghain will supply
the programme.
For the evening entertainment a fine programme has been prepared, one
of the features being a selection of vocal music by members of the St. Boni
face Society. A large attendance is expected, as the many attractions that
St. Paul's Home affords are of a very high order. Mr. and Mrs. Menge have
been very lavish in their efforts to beautify the grounds, and charity should
reap a rich benefit on the Fourth.

To Prevent Irrigation.
t, B ,? R:I ) EI u Elt '* , Jllly 2-Superintendent
Ha 1 of the Alameda Water Company
finds that the notice recently issued for
bidding irrigation of any kind is openly
disregarded by a number of Berkeley resi
dents. The company has no means of en
forcing its notice except by shutting off
the water altogether from the residences
where no heed is paid to thp order and
such a measure as this. Superintendent
HhII says, he is not yet prepared to take

of Trustees, and the board has expressed

NO GARBAGE CREMATORY.
A Committee of the Board of Health
Reports Against the Establish
ment of the Institution.
ALAMEDA, July 2.â At the regular
monthly meeting of the Board of Health
last evening the committee on sewers, â 
garbage, etc.. to whom had been referred '
the proposition of Oakland parties to es
tablish a garbage crematory on the
marshes near the Webster street bridge,
made an adverse report, recommending
that such establishment be not permitted.
This report will be transmitted to tho
Board of City Trustees at its next meet
ing.
The annual reports of the health offi
cials were read, showing among other
things that the death rate for the city for
the past year had been only 12 to every
1000 of population.
Second Lieutenant of Company O.
ALAMEDA, July 2.â An odd tangle has
been discovered with regard to the sec
ond lieutenancy of Company G. Some
months ago there was a vacancy In the
position, and Sergeant McDonnell was
unanimously elected to the office. In ac
cordance with law he went before an ex-
I aminlng board, successfully passed the
required tests, and was so Informed. He
thereupon assumed the duties of the po- ;
sition. But It now transpires that through j
neglect no commission was ever sent to
him. Colonel Smith of ..ie First Regi
ment, now in Manila, was the president
i of the examining board, and should have
I attended to the matter. But he did not,
! and it is supposed took all the papers
, witn him when he left the country. The
technical vacancy has been discovered by
those who are on the lookout for appoint
ments to office, and a determined onset
i has been made at the Governor for an
appointment to the position. McDon
: nells friends, however, are active, and
believe that the technicality should not
be allowed to stand in the way of his re
ceiving the commission which he has
earned. They are working hard for him,
I and hope to convince the Governor that
i the right thing to do Is to appoint him
! to the coveted position.
Fourth of July.
ALAMEDA, July 2.â As customary in
this city there will be no celebration of
the national holiday. Those who desire
will attend the celebrations in Oakland
and San Francisco and this city will be
practically deserted. At 9 o'clock there
will be a formal flag raising at the First
Congregational Cnurch, with appropriate
exercises, but that is all there will be in
commemoration of the day. To-morrow
several of the pastors will deliver patri
otic sermons and special musical services
will be held.
Assessment Rolls Ready.
OAKLAND, July 2.â Assessor Dalton
has almost completed the assessment
rolls of the county and will turn them
over to the Supervisors next Tuesday.
The figures are nearly the same as those
of last year.
The dust of charcoal is gathered up
and mixed with the chaff from wheat,
barley and other grains, and with
chopped straw In Japan. It is then
moistened into a paste, rolled into balls
as big as billiards balls and makes ex

Ten Days of Married Life Was

She Could Enjoy Life

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, July 2.
Mnrrled St. Patrick's Day, March 17. 1398.
Separated April Fool's Day, April 1.
Applied for divorce June 15.
Diiiree granted July 2.
Thus, In a trifle over a hundred days,
Miss Jessie Henderson became Mrs. Jessie
DeLancy and legally returned to Miss
Jessie Henderson.
t Judge Ellsworth to-day granted a decree
of divorce to Jessie Henderson, wife of
John DeLancy. The young couple eloped
to San Jose last St. Patrick's day, and on
their return DeLancv "s father refused to
receive him unless he stnt his wife back
to her mother. Mrs. Henderson was more
thoughtful. She took them both in, and
they resided without any open fighting for
ten days, after which the mother-in-law
decided that young Mr. DeLancy was not
a son-in-law to her liking, and he was
politely told to go.
Young Mrs. DeLancy and her mother
assert that during the brief ten days in
which the young people lived together
DeLanoy beat his wife and showed such
evidence of a cruel nature that she de
cided to get rid of him. DeLancy was
only too willing, and did not take the
trouble to answer her suit for divorce.
DeLancy was prevented by his yuung
wife from carrying an Idea of his own to
have the marriage annulled on the ground
of duress, fraud and similar things. He
declares that he was inveigled into the
home of the Hendersons and detained
there under threats for three days and
that the price of his liberty was his mar
riage to pretty Jessie. TlTis action of his,
however, will now be unnecessary. The
testimony in the case was only taken yes
terday, and only referred to the Court
Commissioner the day before, and the
young lady was given her decree at 10
O'clock this morning. She was IS years of
age two weeks after her marriage.

Fileher the State Board of Trade has de

CHERRY CROP
WAS GOOD
Local Canneries Report
a Large Output.
WHITE LABOR A SUCCESS
SAN LEANDRO IS ANXIOUS TO
BUILD AT ONCE.
Owing to the Partial Failure of the
Fruit Crop the Bonus Cannot
Be Put to Any Use Till
Next Year.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 2.
The cherry season has closed, and de
spite all early prognostications of poor
crops the output has been very satisfac
tory and the amount handled by the can
neries larger than any previous year.
The Haywards cannery, which has just
closed its season of cherry packing, has
handled 90,00u cases this year, which is 50
per cent more than last year and more
than twice as much as the year before.
The value of a cannery in stimulating
local trade is well shown by the new in
dustry located at Haywards two years
ago. There are at present 300 people em
ployed, and in a month, when apricots
and peaches are being picked, this number
will be increased to 500. A large amount
of this fruit comes from the Sacramento
and Feather rivers, and its shipments
have done much to advertise Haywards
abroad.
This cannery was the first to adopt the
plan of employing none but white labor,
and it has been free from the riots which
have been common at Milpitas owing to
the employment of Chinese help. This
year thirty new cottages were built for
the accommodation of employes alone,
and during the busy season $10,000 a
month is paid for assistance.
Realizing the great benefit of a local
cannery, San Leandro has during the past [
year made great efforts to induce some
one to locate at that town. They have
subscribed a cash bonus of $5000, and were
promised early in the year that a cannery |
should be built ready for this season. The \
small crop of many fruits delayed this
project and San Leandro will have to wait
till next year before it reaps the benefits
of a huge cannery.
Several lots of apricots have been sold
during the past week at prices averaging \
$40 a ton. Returns from Eastern markets
for cherries s^uld in carload lots in New
York show t;iat very good prices have
been realized.
The Red Men's Jubilee.
The final meeting of the general com
mittee on Jubilee celebration of the Im
proved Order of Red Men prior to the
event was held last night at Red Men's
Hail, more than seventy representatives
being present. The various committees
reported arrangements completed. The |
marshal presented the order in which the j
tribes and councils will marchâ which will :
be in the order of their seniority, headed j
l>y the marshal, his aids and the mounted '
divisions. The floats will be interspersed
throughout the line. The great chief and
past great sachem will be in carriages.
Also the members of the Degree of Poca
ls. The tribes were again urged to j
be prompt in their attendance.
Berkeley Man Missing.
Walter 1.,. Thomas of West Berkeley,
reported at police headquarters yester
day the strange disappearance of his
friend, R. D. Vansicker. Last Monday
morning Vansicker left the acid works,
West Berkeley, where he was employed,
to get his teeth fixed by a dentist, and
he has not been seen or heard of since.
He is 43 years of age, 5 feet 0% inches,
clean shaven, bald, and of slim build.

public a letter bearing the sign:! ire of
: Henry H." Markham. In this kt:?r the
'-;' people of the Irish race/were referred to
(" in a slighting manner. " The intention of
making It public was to injure Markham's
candidacy. Although given the widest
publicity, it failed in Its purpose and
Markham was elected.
,- Irwln C. Stump, chairman of -the Re
. publican State Central Committee, pro
nounced the letter- a forger; and offered
a reward of $10iX) for the letter, with proof
â¢ of Its genuineness. The letter and the
proof were at once forthcoming. Mr.
Jlarkham refused to pass upon the au
thenticity of the document. Suit was im
mediately commenced against Mr. Stump
to cover the proffered reward.
Judgment was rendered in favor of the
plaintiff by the Superior Court, and upon
appeal' Co the Supreme -Court the judg

DEATH IN FALLING WALLS.
CHARLES GASKILL Killed and Other Laborers In
jured While at Work on a Building.
Charles Gasklll, an aged laboring man, was killed instanty shortly before noon yesterday. Decedent was !
one of a force of men engaged in the demolition of the building on the northeast corner of Powell and Bush streets. J
Shortly before noon the men were tearing down eorae woodwork, preliminary to removing the north wall. Da- J
vld Boger sudenly saw the wall crumblinr and shouting a warning to the other men, rnn toward the street, away J
from the falling bricks. Boger. as he ran, picked up his 11-year-old boy, who was playing about the building, in- ?
tending to take him to a place of safety. ?
Followed by Gaskill he ran out through what was once a doorway. All that remained to mark its location )
waa two stout pillars, about eight Ceet high and two feet thick. As the men ran toward this opening one of the J
pillars commenced to tumble, and as they passed in front of it the pile of masonry fÂ«ll with a crash. The con- J
cussion of the falling wall had shaken it from its foundation. â¢ ?
Boger, with his boy In his arms, was knocked down and sustained injuries, which, it is thought, will prove fa- J
tal. A compound fracture of both bor,< s of the left 1* g, an ordinary fracture of both bones of the right leg and ?
bruises all over the body are supplemented by internal injuries. The extent of the latter could not be determined j
yesterday. t
The boy's Injuries were not serious, being only sprains of the right leg and foot. Both father and son were at- J
fended by Dr. Bunnell and Dr. Rinne at the City Receiving Hospital. J
Gaski!l was not so fortunate as his fellow-laborer. He was slightly deaf and, not heeding the shouts of T. 11. j
Wagner and others, stood for an instant. This proved his undoing, as the mass of brickwork toppled over on him. j
He was killed instantly, being crushed in a terrible manner. j
Decedent was a native of Maine, 76 years of age. lie was originally a seafaring man, and a sturdy, hard- j
working man. He leaves a daughter, who is married, in this city. j
The third man of the party, an Italian named Michael Ratto, did not follow his companions through tho door- J
way. He reached the sidewalk from the opposite side of the pillar to the others, and to this fact he owes his es- }
cape from injury and, possibly, death, j
When the excitement which the accident created had subsided it was found that tho men had left a place of }
Bafety when the alarm was given, and thus imperiled their lives*. From the place where the bricks lay to the J
edge of the sidewalk was a space of thirty feet, in any portion of which the men were safe. )
The house in course '>f demolition was the property of Fletcher F. Ryor, son of the late Dr. Washington J
Ryer. It was ;in ancient structure, and was giving way to a four-story building, in keeping with the times. The J
walls, though thick, were not strong, the plaster crumbling and not holding the bricks together. j
Contractor V. F. Connolly, who was removing the old building, was prostrated when he learned of the death )
of one of his men. "I left them working here this morning, and at that timo> warned them of danger from the rear j
wall. I '.eft orders for them to put a couple of braces against It. Had I been here I would have seen to it that the J
work was properly done. I did not think of danger from the small pillar in front, as it was so thick and short. \
The Jarring given by the falling wall was too much for it and it fell over on the men." j
J. \Y. Flinn, agent for the Ryer estate, was a block away when the accident occurred. He heard the crash and ;
saw the great cloud of dust that was thrown up. When he found that the men had been Injured he did his best to J
relieve their suffering. }
Immediately after the accident District Engineer Shaughnessy of the Fire Department was summoned. With a \
force of men he pulled down the Powell-street wall and a section of the north wall that remained standing. Before J
doing so, be ordered all people out of the adjoini-- house, the foundation of which might be disturbed by the con- J
cushion. j

"UNCLE TOM'S CABIN."
The Good Old Drama Is Presented at

Competent Company.
The nrver-failing attraction, "Uncle
Tom's Cabin." ranked as one of the
American stage classics, was put on at
the California Theater last evening for a
run of nine nights. That the drawing
Qualities of thiÃ dramatic chestnutâ which
seems ever fresh to the amusement public
ant' lias fo often come to the rescue of
the box officeâ havi- not in the least been
diminished by afre was attested by a full
house.
Tlie play was presented by a competent
and well-b:ilfineed company, nutde up
mostly of well-known professionals. The
character of St. Clair, however, was por
trayed by an amateur. Dr. Frank B. Rob
inson, arid the audience manifested great
interest in Ills performance of the role.
Dr Robinson acted the part with all the
Brace and ease of a professional, speaking
his lines In a very natural manner, and
appearing perfectly at home on the stage.
Uncle Tom was admirably played by
Khvs Thomas, whose songs wen- sweetly
surig Miss Edith Hall, from the Tivoli,
proved an ideal Topsy. Uttle Rosie Ben
nett as. Eva was remarkably clever. All

Local Liquor Dealers
Disappointed.
MEAGER RED CROSS FUND
WELL KNOWN RETAILEBS DE
CLINED TO CONTRIBUTE.
Committeemen Discuss Their Griev
ances r.nd Speak Harshly of
These Who Did Not
Help the Cause.
The funds of the Red Cross Society were
increased yesterday by a liberal contribu
tion from the Ketuil Liquor Dealers' As
sociation of this city.
The amount is not so large as the gen
tlemen who collected the money desired
and had reason to believe would be forth
coming. There are 4500 retail dealers in
this city, and the promoters of the move
ment estimated that the average would
be considerably over $1 for each dealer.
They expected to secure fully $15,000.
After three weeks of the most energetic
canvass throughout the city, the volun
teer committee secured $1168 7J. This was
secured only by the expenditure of much
time and of practically dollar for dollar
of the amount collected. The committee
of which the members labored so zealous
ly in the humanitarian cause was made
up of nine of the best-known dealers in
the city. The roll of honor reads:
Henry Adler, president.
Jesse Marks, vice
T. M. Ferguson, treasurer.
J. E. Krumb, secretary.
William Koeder.
Joseph Parker.
E. W. Osborn.
Charles Green.
Kudy Fishbeck.
Now that the incident Is closed and the
labors of the committee have ended, the
members are discussing thoir experiences
In their unselfish labors. What they have
to say is not complimentary to some men
whose prosperity, it was supposed, would
prompt them to do something for the
men who are at the front lighting for
their country.
"Pop" Sullivan, of the Hoffman Cafe,
is one of the men who was handled with
out gloves at the last meeting of the com
mittee. A subscription blank was left with
him for three weeks. At the end of that
time a well-known number of the com
mittee called for it. lie was struck dumb
when he found that there was not an
entry on it. Mr. Sullivan, who is credited
with a yearly profit of some $25,000, had
not subscribed a cent!
The committeeman turned away more in
sorrow than in wrath, fearing to voico
his feelings in the frame of mind in which
he found himself.
Down at Frank Garcia's, on Montgom
ery street, opposite the Occidental Hotel,
the Red Cross cause received the same
chilling reception.
Matt Storn, the widely known horseman,
was at the bar when the committeeman
called. He was about to drink a social
glass, but the reception accorded the Red
Cross representative stayed his hand.
The refusi..! to aid the cause was couched
in such s'.rong language that Storn and
his friends would not taste the liquor.
They paid for their drinks, left them
standing on the bar and vowed openly,
that they would never again seek enter
tainment there.
The representatives of the committee
received a similar reception at Obermey
er's, opposite the Palace Hotel, and we're
practically ordered out of Mangels
Brothers' store, Franklin and Hayes
streets.
J. Bogan of the Louvre, with his army
of employes, could only collect $5. while
the Baldwin Grotto contributed just $1 50.
Among the liberal contributors, in addi
tion to the splendid workers of the com
mittee, were M. E. Hornleln of the Cafe
Royal, J. P. Dunne and Charles Ascher
of the Baldwin Hotel.
The movement was Inaugurated in an
unostentatious manner by Harry Adler,
proprietor of Frank's Billiard Parlor.
With big-hearted T. M. Ferguson, he, in
common with the remaining members,
Bpent their time and their money in the
cause. With the support they had reason
to expect from the men who did not con
tribute, they would have made a showing
in keeping with their expectations.
BURGLARS FIRED UPON.
Three of Them Meet With a Warn
Reception From Charles A.
Carr, Gunsmith.
Three men broke into the store of
Charles A. Carr, gunsmith, 350% Third
street, shortly before 1 o'clock yesterday
morning by forcing open the front door.
% Carr sleeps in the store and was awak
ened by the noise. He waited till they en
tered, and seizing his revolver fired at one
of the burglars as he struck a match. The
three promptly fled from the store and
Carr fired another shot at their retreating
figures. He does not know whether either
of the shots took effect, but all yesterday
the police in the southern dfstrict were on
the lookout for a wounded burglar.
The burglars were seen by Carr to run
along Harrison street toward Fourth, and
that was the last seen of them. Carr no
tified policeman J. J. Reilly, who at once
communicated with the Southern station
office. The attaches at the Receiving Hos
pital were instructed to hold any man
taken in for treatment for a gunshot
wound, but no such man appeared. An ex
iiminution showed that nothing had been
taken from the store.
Played With a Fire Alarm.
Henry Krey was arrested by Officer
Flinn last evening for turning in a false
alarm for fire. Krey asserts that he had
no intention of calling out the fire depart
ment, but wished to secure the services of
a policeman. He was coming along Kear
ny street about 6 o'clock and saw a
drunken man lying in the gutter at the
corner of Clay. The fire box on the cor
ner he took for a police telephone and pro
curing tjie key from a neighboring drug
store turned In an alarm from box 21. To
his great surprise the fire department re
sponded instead of the police patrol, but
the latter soon made its appearance, and
in company with his drunken protege Mr.
Krey was taken to the California street
station.
. Â«. .
Wanted for Pilfering Onions.
Two men, believed to be E. C. Ander
son and Andrew Jackson, and said to be
employed on a morning paper, nre being
sought by the police. Early yesterday
morning thoy were observed near the City
Hall with their arms full of young onions,
which they claimed they had "found."
The police say the men are old offenders
and nad evidently taken the vegetables
from in front of Homo dealer's store,
where they had been left by a market
gardener.
Patriotic Policemen.
A hundred yards of red. white and blue
bunting tastefully draped in front of the
California-street station attest the pa
triotism of the police officers on the down
town beats. Over the door is a picture of
Commodore Sohley. and on each side good
lithographs of Admirals Sampson and
Dewey. These decorations, set off by
the large flag recently purchased by the
officers, give the station quite a Fourth of
July appearance.
Nearly Asphyxiated.
Mrs. Beaby. residing 1 at 5 Birch avenue,
narrowly escaped, death by asphyxiation
by ; gas last evening. She was found lying
on the floor of her room In an unconscious
condition by her sister. Mrs. Johns.; and
was taken to the .Receiving Hospital,
where Dr. "Wetmore soon had her out of

SUPPLY OF WHEAT
.iEMARK'.BLY LOW
BABELY ENOUGH TO CAKRY
OVER TO THE NEW CROFS.
Believed to Have Touched Bottom and
Will Show an Upward Ten
dency for Some Time.
Owing to the Fourth of July, all wheat
and cotton exchanges will be closed from
Friday, July 1, at 1:35 p. m., until Tuesday,
July 5. The week just closed has seen
quite a reversal in the sentiment control
ling wheat prices. Early in the week the
market was devoid of support. The very
thought that wheat prices had favored
prospects ahead met with ridicule.
The argument was heralded about that
England and France were heavily short
on wheat In American markets. This
weight alone would keep the market from
advancing. People who were so inclined
overlooked the fact that foreigners were
selling what they could not deliver. They
were hedging spot wheat held in foreign
elevators. While this sentiment of bear
ishness was accumulating. Armour and
other wise operators were quietly buying.
Letter's wheat has been gathered into
camp by Armour around 80 cents for spot
and 73 cents for July. The condition has
improved materially. Wheat has gone
from weak into strong hands. The mar
ket is in a congested condition. Outsiders
are heavily short. They have followed
Dame Fashion, and have to face losses
at the present time.
Conditions do not warrant wheat selling
under 70 cents. Many States are reporting
disappointing threshing returns, Illinois
showing the yield at ten bushels, against
the Government report of fifteen bushels
per acre. Indiana, Ohio, Missouri and
Kansas continue to report severe damage
to the crops, too much moisture and cold
weather being the causes. If reports re
garding the crop are true, and there seems
no good grounds to believe them other
wise, the wheat crop of IX9B will not be
more than an average one, and In this
connection must come the. basis upon
which prices must stand this year. Every
wheat-growing country on the globe has
small reserves to carry Into a new crop.
The holes to be tilled up will require an
immense amount from the coming crop.
While there is no definite Information |
regarding Russia s crop prospects, yet i
enough is known to say they are very dis
couraging, and must exert an influence of
no little Importance in the near future.
The receipts of wheat at primary points
during the past week have never been bo
small, showing the very small reserves in
farmers' hands. The high prices pfevail
ing during Letter's period brought out
every available bushel of wheat that could
be scratched up from bins. Never in the
history of the United States has there
been so little wheat to carry over from
an old to a new crop. The liquida:ion by
July longs is over. This pressure uidud
the bears, who seized the opportunity and
pressed their influence. Snortlrg wheat
has become very fashionable. Armour,
who is now In full control of tliÂ« market.
Is not always disposed to shape his ac
tions upon the lines of speculative society.
The spring wheat factor from. now on will
play an important role. Conditions are
claimed as brilliant. July and the tlrst
part of August are trying tim<?s for spring
wheat. Should any accident overtake It,
foielgners would not be slow in accepting
changed conditions.
It was pointed out in last week's review,
qs well as the previous week, that Sep
tember wheat might sell at or near 6fi
cents in the Chicago market and around
$1 20 for December in t\e local market.
The prices reached wore w^i cents in Chi
cago and $1 21% in the lotiftl market.
Basing calculations u?on conditions as
they appear at the present time, it looks
as If wheat had touched bottom and will
continue to show an upward tendency for
some time, or at leas'- until farmers' de
liveries grow into large proportions, which
seems unlikely. They have been educated
up to dollar wheat, *nd will not be anx
ious to sell at what appear unreasonably
low prices. Farmers aro. financially able
to hold their grain for suitable returns.
This Item will sho* its effect in a manner
not to be mistake:'- Barley, while some
what higher, nan not the element of
strength Its friends claim ffcr It. Un
doubtedly a drawing V"t active market
will characterize the trade for some tfme.
Wheat in Chicago market closed at 70^
cents for September and in local at $1 30? 4
for December, and barley |l 19%.

At that moment Cervera at Santiago
and General Blanco at Havana were
the most deeply concerned Spaniards in
all Cuba. The fate of Spain was being
decided. The chief factor in the coun
cil of war, so far as the Cuban cause
was concerned, was General Garcia. A
great change had come to him since
he Â« ;is a hunted fugitive in the dark
days of the revolution. Those who
know him best ackno%vledge his lofty
courage and commanding ability.
Richard Harding Davis described him
as bidding good-by to the American
generals, "looking, with his beard and
mustache of the Third Empire, like a
marshal of France."
What is the life history of this de
voted patriotâ this intrepid hero of
Cuba's war for liberty?
General Calixto Garcia, by birth a
Cuban, formerly a resident of New
fork, is about 59 years old, decidedly
fected, and ?o the three battleships
were armored with Harveyized steel.
There are no ships afloat having the
defensive strength of these three bat
tleships with their eighteen inches of
Harveyized armor.
We were much exercised over the
question of the freeboard of the new
ships. After the design had been ac
cepted, the department received a pho
tograph of an English ship with only
two feet less of freeboard, which was
submerged like a monitor when at sea.
We were very anxious until the first
battleship had had her trial as to
whether they would be "dry ships" or
so wet as to greatly mar their useful
ness at sea. They proved to be dry and
excellent sea-going ahips. Before the
character of the Oregon class had been
determined the lowa was designed, and
she was called a sea-going battleship
with a much lighter freeboard. Stand
ing as far out at the water as she does,
she is a much larger target, and the
necessity of building the turrets for her
big guns so much higher Increased her
weight greatly.
Ship for ship our navy is the equal of
any navy in the world, although in
some respects we have not kept pace
with the rest of the world in recent
years. We originated the armorel

He was one of the organizers of that
first Cuban revolution of 18t>8. He met
with his friends nightly at a farm
owned by Donato Marmol, near the
town of Holguln. The Cubans were al
ready in revolt under Cespedes, and
within two days Marmol and Garcia
took up arms with 150 resolute follow
ers. Extraordinary success attended
them. Town after town surrendered,
first Santa Rita, then Juguanl, after
hard fighting, with its 20,000 population.
For his bravery Garcia was promoted

moreJ cruiser? A protected cruiser has
a protective deck beginning below the
water line and arching over the ma
cliinÂ«iy. With a bulkhead at each enC
it forms v steel box around the machin
ery. A shell striking this deck on either
side would likely be deflected. But a
shell might strike the arch perpendic
ularly and pass through.
The armored cruiser has the protec
tive deck and has also a belt of armor
on the outside of the ship beginning be
low the water line and extending up to
the level of the protective deck, so that
a shell which would strike either a di
rect blow would strike the other at an
angle and so be deflected. The New
York Is of that type and I believe she
is the first armored cruiser ever built.
Other nations have coDied the typo and
improved on it. We ourselves made a
better ship when we built the Brooklyn.
Since that time other nations have beon
going ahead and we have been stand
ing still. To-f.ay Spain has six armored
cruisers which are stronger than ours.
Spain's cruisers carry two 11-inch guns,
while the New York carries six and the
Brooklyn eight 8-inch guns.
And yet I don't know that I should
be afraid to have the Brooklyn meet
any of the Spanish ships. There is the
difference in -he men, of course; and
our ships would have eight large guns
against the Span. aid's two, thus hav
ing four chances to one to make a hit,
and several hits with the 8-lnch gun
would be likely to settle the business
for the Spanish vesse' The power of
Later, when the provisional govern
ment for some reason not clearly ex
plained, removed Gomez, Garcia suc
ceeded him. Finding that Juguant had,
meanwhile, been retaken by the Span
iards, he proceeded to capture It again.
He next took Holguin, the town where
the revolution was originally organ
ized. Other victories rapidly followed.
At the obstinate all day battle of
Santa Maria, in 18G9, he followed Yon
Moltke's tactics at Sedan â surrounded
the enemy's urmy and forced the sur

They were well treated and given free

So grateful were they for the unex

generosity of Garcia. But victory did

the big guns has beeen greatly In
creased since I was Secretary of the
Navy.
I believe the 10-inch gun to-day is as
effective as the 13-inch gun was when
we built the Oregon in all but one par
ticular, and that is in the explosive
force of the shell. But either shell, if it
exploded in a ship, would be terribly
destructive and no ship could stand
many such explosions.
I look for a large increase of the navy

lieve the war has given the people of
the country an object lesson in the
value of the navy which will create
public sentiment in favor of large na

Our navy must be greatly increased.
The present Congress should not ad
journ without appropriating $100,000, 0U0
to the construction of the new navy.
We need strong and faster battle-ships,
and we need many more fast and
strong armored cruisers. Indeed, I
think the distinction between the ar
mored cruiser and the battle-ship will
practically disappear in the near fu
ture. The crying need of our navy to
day is faster battle-ships. The advance
in construction since the Oregon and
her sister ships were designed has prac
t! ally rendered the 16-knot battle
ship obsolete, except for two purposes â
to defend home ports when attacked or
to attack the land fortifications of an
enemy. But for service upon the open
ocean the faster ships of other nations
have rendered them practically use
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JULY 3, 1898.
Garcia with his guard oÂ£ twenty men
was surrounded by 500 Spaniards and,
when at the last moment capture was
inevitable, rather than surrender and
die of torture, Garcia fired his pistol
into his m >uth, and fell among his dead
comrades. The Spaniards carried him
to Manzanillo in triumph, also thinking
him dead. To the amazement of Span
ish doctors and geiierals, Garcia re
vived, although the bul'.et had pene
trated his palate, following the line of
his nose and emerging from his fore
head.
It seemed a miracle that the general
lived. Then it was equally surprising
that, recovering, he escaped execution.
But he was spared and imprisoned at
Valencia and Santona, in Spain.
Fortunately for Garcia, General Cam
pos, Governor General of Havana, was
not vindictive, for when peace was de
clared in 1577, Premier Canovas freed
him at the cabled request of Campos.
less.
It Is folly to send a slxteen-knot ship
to cruise in the open sea in search of a
twenty-knot ship. All other nations
are. now builuing eighteen and twenty
knot battle-ships. And yet I regret to
observe that It Is proposed that we
shall continue to build the slxteen-knot
battle-ship. In building the Indiana
and Oregon class we built the strong
est battle-ships known to the world.
Other nations changed the strategy
by building battle-ships strong In of
fensive and defensive power, but which
could outrun them. We go on building
the same old ship.
The need of the hour is a new type of
battle-ship â one which In Its combi
nation of speed with offensive and de
fensive power will surpass anything
yet designed. It is not enough that we
have strong ships or fast ships. We
must have a ship which is both fa^t
and strong. This other nations have
and we have not. Of course if we build
a battle-ship with twenty-one knots of
speed we must sacrifice something of
armor and armament. But still such
a vessel, as an all-around righting ma
chine, would be greatly superior to any
thing we have in our navy to-day.
The new ship should be of 12,000 or
13,000 tons. It shoi'M have not over
twelve inches of armor. Few ships of
other nations have heavier armor than
this now. It should have large coal ca
pacity to give it a wide radius of ac
tion. It should be able to steam twen
ty-one knots an hour, and it should be
armed with eight 10-inch gruns. Not
This explains why Martinez Oampos
has always been respected and admired
by the insurgents.
Notwithstanding he was free, Garcia
did not fully believe in the sincerity of
the peace treaty, and he came to New
York to await further developments. It
soon transpired that the Spaniards,
were not keeping their promises in good
faith, and bitter dissatisfaction pre
vailed. Hostilities continued, and Gen
eral Maceo continued to hold his
ground against great odds. The cour
age and patriotism of the heroic mu
latto general fired Garcia's heart anew,
and again he appeared in the field dur
ing what was known as the "Little
War." until he was defeated and again
taken prisoner.
For the second time his life was
spared. He was sent to Madrid, how
ever, where he was allowed lfmited

only is the 10-inch gun sufficiently ef
fective against any armor, but it can
be operated in case of necessity by
hand. We have yet to- learn whether a
heavy shot striking the turret of the
13-inch gun would not put the mechan
ism by which it is operated out of or
der and disable the ship to that extent.
If this happened to the 10-inch gun, as
I said, it could be worked by hand; the
18-inch gun could not.
The recent act of Congress authoriz
ing the construction of monitors of 14
knots speed, not to exceed $2,500,000 in
cost, is greatly to be regretted. To
build these ships having 14 knots of
speed will compel the department to
build single turreted monitors. As a
monitor is designed for harbor defense,
the qu?stion of speed ts of secondary
consideration. Eight knots is just as
effective in a harbor as 14. And yet the
extra cost of the machinery to give this
I extra 6 knots of unnecessary speed
compels the construction of a single
turreted monitor when at 8 knots of
speed there could be constructed a
double-turreted monitor which would
be just twice as effective. These mon- !
itors are not worth $1,250,000 and their j
construction le a waste of money.

adopt a naval policy like Great Brit

how the happiness I felt at being extravagantly re
warded, served but to edge my despondency at Gettya
buFg on this Fourth of Fourths.
Frevious to this time I had been off scouting; but
on the third day's battle I took command on the left:
of Little Round Top. By the heroic charge of Mc-
Candless's brigade and the Eleventh Pennsylvania

to our discomfiture and intensified oui groom.
To cap the climax word was brought in camp that
Lee had escaped across the Potomac and had made

THE bitterest disappointment of my youth I as
sociate with Independence Day. When a young
man in my teens I was very much in love with
a young Virginia bud who attended a seminary
not far distant. It was my very rirst love affair
and I was dreadfully serious and puzzled to know the
extent of her regard for me. I never could get her to
tell. She was my ideal of
beauty and grace, with Just
enough tact to ward off the
conversation that most filled

my mind by changing the subject. Just how to make
her listen and answer me became my study. At last
my opportunity arrived.
There was to be an oratorical contest In my col
lege and by passing a creditable examination I was
chosen orator of this occas.on. I was in luck, for fol
lowing upon the heels of this honor came the invita
tion to deliver the Fourth of July oration. I pinned
my faith in her love upon my success at this college
contest.
Now I must distinguish myself. She was not there
on that all eventful night, but the newspaper notices
made her proud of my friendship. But as a test of
her love I must excel myself on the Fourth of July
oration and if she were pleased with my efforts she
would then give me her answer.
Then. I began to burn midnight oil.
On the night of the 3d I had learned it by heart

The grove where the oration was to be delivered

thing was in readiness for the programme. The next
morning I was awakened early by my responsibility
and a big clap of thunder that rumbled through the
heavens and rattled the windows of my sleeping apart

My wife gave me a most useful needle case with
scissors, thimble, etc., and early In the morning on
this Fourth of July I took the shelter-tent for the
material out of which to make my new trousers. This
was my first trial at tailoring and by noon I had
worked up a perspiration that can only be equaled by
an Hammam bath. My needle-pricked fingers were
bleeding and my canvas pants were polKa dotted with
gore. I worked at those pants all that day and when
night came I was actually sick with weariness. But
when I put them on I was a sight to behold. Just
where they should have been large they were too small
and vice versa. They were as full of corners and
lumps as a horned toad and I found that I couldn't sit
down in them comfortably unless I turned them rear
side before.
Everybody laughed at me for I looked so utterly
wretched, whether walking or star ling. When Gen
eral Otis came into camp the next day he gave me
the undignified sobriquet of Colonel Breeches. Any
way it \v;is the most nerve wrecking and 1 may add
most profane Fourth of my life.
MY unfortunate Fourth of July experience dates
back to the year 1857. At this lime I was
drummer boy in the First Regiment of the
Wisconsin State Militia and my friend, who

We had been betting on hit or miss and putting
our clothes up for security, each one donning the ar
ticle as soon as the bet was won, so that when my
mother Joined us I was to all appearances more lika
Mac Arthur than myself in matters of flress.
The pistol we used had a saw handle and a steel
projection that came back over the wrist to give ad
ditional strength and was extremely heavy. I coaxed
and finally persuaded my mother to try her hand at
the target and gave her the loaded pistol. She fired
and the recoil was so great that the weapon flew back
and struck her in the forehead with the sharp end of
the steel projection. I don't think any boy ever felt
remorse more keenly than I, for she was so good and
patient, not wishing to hurt my feelings or spoil my
holiday with thoughts of her suffering.
But the delights of the Fourth were over for me
and I went to field practice the next morning with a
heavy heart.

THE most unfortunate Fourth of July for some
of my friends occurred the day I was born. It
was so long ago, however, that I have forgotten
how I felt about !t. At any rate there was one
pleasure in boyhood for me in having my birth
day fall on our nation's birthday because my parents
always gave me a present of money in addition to my
Independence Day fund, and
as money is king I ruled my
-playmates with a high hand,
for I spent it all for fireworks.

On the night before this all eventful day I counted
my money over and over again. ifty cents was all
that I realized out of my three weeks* hard work.
Even this amount made me happy and I was up bright
and early the next morning to map out my campaign
for that day of days.
To begin with I spent 20 cents of the 50 for torpedoes
an.l took them out of their sawdust box and put them
Into the Bjacious pocket of my new linen duster that
my mother had just finished. Prior to this time it
had not been considered necessary for boys to wear
coats at this season of the year and before the day
was over I was a living testimonial to the fact that
this article of clothing was a foolish piece of extrava
gance.
xhe torpedoes were safe enough until in the wild

exuberance of my joy I gave vent to my feelings by
slapnlng my sides and â the torpedoes did the rest. My
clothing on one side was utterly wrecked. I hadn't the
least desire to go home to mother either. Somehow I
was always careful about alarming mother wnen any
thing serious happened to my apparel. Past experi
ences taught me that these surprises were a shock to
her nerves and in the end most disastrous to me.
One of the boys had a home-made cannon which he
sold me for 10 cents. I bought 10 cents worth of
powder and together we proceeded to the edge of the
lake where we found an old stump or a tree â just the
thing to hold our toy cannon. We filled it full and
rammed it tightly with powder for we wanted a big
report because some Sunday-school picnickers were
listening for it. We got the report all right, but the
recoil knocked the cannon into the bottom of the lake.
I dived for it all unmindful of my clothes and mother,
but of no avail. It couldn't be raised.
I still had 10 cents left and I think I got more real
pleasure out of my last dime which I spent for ginger
bread and peanuts than I did out of the whole day's
celebration.
I went home late that night hoping to find my
parents asleep â but I didn't.

FOURTH of July, 1863, brings to my mind more
disagreeable recollections than any other within
my memory. On that day, during the progress
of the war, I was with my old regiment, the
Twelfth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, on board of
a little stern-wheel steamer puffing her way labori
ously down the Kanawha River in West Virginia.
We were on an expedition

in pursuit of the famous
rebel raider, John Morgan,
who was then on a rapid
march through Indiana and Ohio. Morgan had
marched through the flank of the Union forces in
tachments devastated the country on his way. The
infantry forces of which I (then a. lieutenant) was
serving had orders to co-operate with trie Union cav
alry in the pursuit. To that end in order to make
time we were transported on steamboats down the
Kanawha River and up the Ohio as far as the famous
Blennerhassett Island. Here an engagement took
place and a portion of Morgan's command continued
its flight badly demoralized. The only disagreeable
feature of this campaign was confined to the steam
boat voyage which included the Fourth of July and in
volved the crowding of the troops of my command
onto a small river ship not built or equipped for such
emergencies.
Imagine, if you can, a pleasurable Fourth spent on
board a boat with barely standing room for its men
and with the sun of the South beating down upon the
water.

IN- the days of my boyhood the celebration of In

casion to me. The booming of cannon, the parade
of citizen soldiers and the most attractive feature

things were sold. My! how I used to hang around

those venders and wish and wish that I hadn't lost
that dime. For that was my
earliest recollection of an un
happy Fourth.
In those days boys were
not given an Astor purse to burn in powder and I
thought I was faring well indeed on this Fourth when
my father gave me a 10-cent piece. I was so happy at
the thought of this wealth that I stopped to play leap
frog with some companions who were less fortunate
than I and I did this to my undoing. I remember dis
tinctly that I had quite a crowd of little boys follow
ing in my wake â for they knew full well that what
ever I bought I would willingly share it with them.
At last an old Rip Van Winkle looking Italian
vender cried out, "Here's your flna cakie. I sella two
for una centsa, with a pluma right in tne midaia."
This was my opportunity to shine. I walked up to
him proudly conscious that I had that dime, and while
the vender was counting the cakes out I was fumbling
in my pocket for that coin. I never will forget my
confusion. The blood rushed to my face and I stam
mered out, "It's gone." WÂ«a did not get the cakes and
the vender said something in Italian as we hurried
away on a fruitless search for that holiday prize.

Fourth of July in the Swiss city of Zurich.
The old tavern known as "The Raven of

the occasional tourist brought down upon it
the anathema of Longfellow, "Beware of the raven of
Zurich," was the scene of the celebration.
Several Americans, who

of their national poet, found
themselves in this city on the way to the Swiss lakes,
and after visiting a fair, which was then in progress,
dropped into the tavern, after the manner of the
country, to quaff a foaming beaker to their native land.
The proprietor and some of his guests evidently
were not aware that there was such a thing as a
declaration of American independence until some of
the more obstreperous of the party reminded him and
his other guests of it. Nor did it mend matters when
the demonstration of noise and the apportion of brag
gadocio were excused on the ground of Fourth of July
license.
The oratorical fireworks of the group. I am afraid,
shed more heat than light, and, unlike such entertain
ments under ordinary circumstances, gave no pleasure
whatever to the spectators. In fact I may say that
the host was ruda; that he had neither knowledge nor
appreciation of American history and looked as though
he would say that a successful rebellion in the wilds
of the new world is no warrant for a demonstration
in Europe, classic and civilized.

But in half an hour what a change!
The spirit of the thing pervades one's
veins like wine. One realizes that it is
not the flowers, that it is not the arches
nor the display that brings forth that
dense Parisian crowd, but that the
whole thing is simply an excuse for an
afternoon of mad, French abandon
ment. A flower there is not ,1 thing to
be 1 oke<3 at and loved and admired; it
is simply something to be torn to pieces

dunned her swellest gown and did not
disdain to compete for admiring glanr-os

I chariotâ with her who wore a bouquet
in the top of her satin boot and left it
carefully exposed to view. And Cleb
Mirode was there looking like a flower
herself in a pale pink gown and a gor
geous hefdgear of La France roses.
She was very demure, this madonna
like Cleo and quite properly chaperoned.
! They made me think of Juliet and the
I nurse, she and her chaperon. Surely
Cleo must eventually be like Juliet, a
victim of love, for no other death %vould
ibe at all fitting for one so rare. A
j wrinkle in her face would mean as
i great a trageuy though hardly so ar
tistic as the dagger of Romeo.
Yes, all the world was thereâ the rich
and prosperous in the carriages, the
middle class gaping on the sidewalks,
: and underneath the horse's feet gather
! ing up the flowers that fell between

! at your purses, snatching the flowers

detestable French rabble that no o.e

hend. Beside it an American rabble Is
tit for the Queen's drawing-room. In
j an American crowd you tremble lest
i you lose your purse, but here it is lest
your oyes he scratched and your hair
be pulled. The Parisian rabble is some
thing to be feared as wild beasts are
feared.
At present In spite of assertions to the
contrary there is a decided feeling
against the Americans. The well-bred
French people do not express them
selves that way to Americans, but it is
in the air. fur the rabble has caught it.
And it knows us unmiKtakably, this
keen-scented rabble â it is not at all
necessary tha.* tV Ftars and stripes be
painted upon one's brow. We experi
enced several evidences of this anti-
American spirit on the afternoon of the
I fete; 'tis true that the tnunts came
from under the horse's hoofs and yet
the voice of the street is surely not a
very uncertain straw to show the di
rection of French prejudice.
But one does not philosophize for
many continuous peconds at the fete;
! the spirit of thÂ° thins is to forget, to
! abandon oneself to the enchantment
jof the hour. It is really an experience
lin one's life, this Parisian feteâ it is re
| eeiving a smile and a flower from the
man or the woman whom you have
never seen before and will never see
again; it is once in your life when it is
quite conime il faut to neglect the lit
tle proprieties on -which you have been
reared. It is a grand frolic in which
there is no choice but participation
after one is there.
I think this thing could not exist in
any other place in the world, for it is
most essentially Parisianâ it is the
spirit of Paris unfettered.
Among the Americans whom I no
ticed at the fete were Senator McAl
lister and wife and Mrs. Woodward
and daughter of San Francisco; also
Mr. and Mrs. William Hunt and Miss
Helen Lindley of Sacramento.
On Pentecost Sunday the students of
the Latin quarter celebrated the Feast
of Fools, and the Ass, a revival of a
medieval custom. Naturally the cele
bration was unique in the extreme. The
idea was to reproduce exactly the pro
cession of the fools and the ass as con
ducted in the fifteenth century. The
procession, which consisted of the theo
logians, the woman on the ass, the
prophets, the- vagrants, etc., finally
made a triumphant entry at the ker
messe, which had been installed on the
Place dv Pantheon. Here was repro
duced the drama of the "Mystery of
Adam," comprising the expulsion of
Adam and Eve from Paradise, the
death of Abel, and finally a procession
of prophets predicting the coming of
Christ. Numerous devils and angels
made the thing complete.
CURIOUS STUDIES
OF BRAIN PROCESSES
<NotÂ£blÃ ; Instances* Whepe .Men Went
. Though the World Jill Right With Onlj
Papt of Their , Brains in Working Order.
WITHOUT the connecting struc
ture there can be no exact co
operative action of the double
brain. Now, there is ample
evidence to show that defi
ciency of the corpus callosum has not
necessarily been attended with the ef
fects which, on the theory of the sin
gle nature of the brain, we should have
expected. In instances in which it was
discovered after death that the con
necting bridge between the hemispheres
was entirely wanting, neither derange
ment in intellect was observed, nor any
other abnormality of life in the way
of movement or sensation.
Thus, in the notable case of Bichat,
one of the foremost anatomists of his
day, one lobe of his brain was found
markedly smaller than the other. He
was, in fact, deficient in one-half of his
brain, and yet his mental and physical
life was in its way notably of a high
order. In another case, reported by
Cruveilhier, a man died in the hospital
at the age of 42 years from heart dis- j
ease. H> exhibited no lack of intelli
gence, yet after his death it was dis
covered that his left brain was practi
cally destroyed and replaced by a wat
ery substance. Another case, reported
by Andral, was of a man who died at
the age of 2S. He had suffered from
a fall when three years old, and as a
result waa paralyzed on his left side.
The right half of his brain had practi
cally disappear. d. so that the parts be
low this half constituted the floor for
an empty space. Andral says of this
man that he "had received a good edu
cation, and had profited by it; he had
;a good. memory; his speech was free
! and easy; his intelligence was such as
Â we should expect to find in an ordinary
] man."
In the ordinary working of the brain
one half is more active than the other,
and exercises a superiority on its neigh
bor lobe. This lobe â in ordinary per
sons the left, of course â is the cere
bral master. Heredity, education or
what we willâ all the combined influ
ences, in short, which mold human Ufa
â have tended, by some process of.phys
iological selection, to place . one lobe
over the other in point of importance.
The other (right) lobe is the servant
of the left in a measure. Ita educa
tion has been neglected, and it re
quires the control of its better cultured
neighbor in order that life may be con
ducted in a sensible and sane fashion.
: The most hopeless cases of insanity,
j TVigan would have held, would be thosa
in which both hemispheres were af
fected. If one was alone ailing, the
other might exert more or less control
over it, and the extent of the control
would depend on which lobe exhibited
the liseased action. All degrees of
insanity or menta.l derangement could
thus be accounted for on this suppo
| sition of the relative .control of one
| hemisphere by the other.. The perfect
life is that in which the better and
higher half controls the weaker and
less responsible. * * * In our courts

was that no one should smoke be
tween decks. This was ordered not
from any precedent in the navy,
but for the very "nod reason that our
cargo was largely made up of hay
bales, which were on the same deck
as the sleeping quarters of a large por
tion of the men.
During the whole of this trip I did
not hear o-f a single man being drunk,
nor did I hear of any complaints on ac
count of the necessarily hard life they
Were compelled to lead.
. Not a single man had - bunk or a
hammock during the entire trip. There
was room for very few down below.
Host of th<; two companies had to
sleep on the two upper decks, which
in this particular craft were open to
the weather. Thus when it ra'ned â
and it did rain very hard off the Cuban
coast â the men clee-ing on the decks
had to get up and stand huddled to
gether through the nightâ at least un
til the rain was past. Most of them
were drenched through several times.
However, all of them were so glad
to get away from Tampa and sue some
thing of actual service that they had
no fault to find.
The same men had traveled some
three or four thousand miles by rail
before reaching Tampa, and had been
twelve days on the journey, during
which they had been treated worse
than cattle. This I mention here only
in parenthesis to Illustrate how men of
so much intelligence and familiarity
with good living are able to submit to
treatment which would be regarded as
barbarous by officers in the Russian
army.

o'clock, ihese two companies of United

ashore we must understand just how
rmioh danger there was in the under
taking.from their own point of view.
Presumably the Spanish garrisons
from Havana all the way to Cabanas
knew of our presence. If they did not
4t was their fault, for we coasted near
to shore the whole day on a very con
spicuous paddle steamer painted red.
We anchored within half a mile of
shore and disembarked a dozen reyu
lprf on a beach of which we knew
nothing excepting that it was about a
mile from Cabanas, in which, accord
ing to our Cuban guides, there was or
had been a garrison of 2000 Spaniards.
According. to all the probabilities, a
Spanish force would be on hand to dis
pute our landing. Those flFst few men
who landed through the surf went as
coolly. as though by special invitation
of friends on shore. There was no pa
rade of fine sentiment, no handshak
ing, no address from the commanding
officer, no serving out of stimulating
drink, which sometimes makes men
careless of danger.
Thick tropical bushes lined the beach,
and behind these we felt confident that
Spanish sharpshooters must be lying

of artillery that would open upon our
crazy transport so soon as we should
have got the bulk of our landing party
under way for the shore.
Every private who went on this trip
knew the situation as well as his offi
cers. There was an ominous silence on
shore, and no unnecessary talk on
board.
We had no bluejackets on board and
i had, therefore, to make use of the civ
j Ulan crew of the transport, four men,
with a cockswain named John Dono
van. This same John Donovan knew
well that if he were caught ashore he
would be treated as an insurgent or
pirate along v h the rest of the crew
of ununiformed filibusters. But John
Donovan never bothered his head about
International law more than to remem
ber that he was a thoroughbred Irish
man, with a coating of citizenship, and
a profound contempt for the "dago"
and all others not of his own skin and
kidney.
John Donovan was a splendid pic
ture of manhood as he stood up in the
stern of the whaleboat, steering with
his long sweep, and guiding his crew
to where he thought the surf the least
dangerous. That was not saying much,
for the transport was anchored off a
coral reef, extending as far as the eye
could reach in each direction. The
waves broke high on this reef, and the
j men had to spring out of the boats and
I drag thorn for a distance of perhaps
a hundred yards. Some of the
boats capsized c-utrlght, and in each
case there were many minutes when
th<- different crews were up to their
! necks in the breakers, holding aloft
i their rilics and wondering why the
; Spaniards did not seize this opportuni
| ty of shooting them to pieces.
Ah there were not enough deck-hands
on the transport to row more than one
Bma.U boat at a time, the commander
I called for volunteers. There was no
lack of them from the privates. One
was my German friend, Buerger, who
had served in the Franco- German war,
had then served in the United States
navy, hud then been transferred to
the army, und had already served Un
cle Sam eighteen years. I had many
a ohat with him during the trip and
found hin; one of the few happy men
I have ever met. He loved the service,
had no idea of bring anythingelse than
a regular soldier, spoke English with
a Ftrong native accent, was proud of
the German Emperor, but thought. Ger
many was going to the devil from too
much government.
Uue-ger stepped into his seat, picked
up his sweep und pulled for the Cuban
shore with mt'chanical ease and ain
phibiousness. There were iOG soldiers
altogether on board and about half of
them went ashore, while the other
half lin^d the bulwarks of the trans
portâtheir rilles ready.
It was hard to say wl. h was the
most dangerous, to remain on the
transport or go ashore. Both were bad
enough as picnic grounds. One shot
from shore could send the rotten old
paddleboat to the bottom In five fath
oms of water, witl- no means of saving
life except by swimming amid sharks
and break*
There was a moment when about a
dozen regulars stood alone upon the
Cuban beach while the small boats
were struggling through the surf to
take off more men. But never was
there among these or any of those who
followed the s. ghtest hesitation to fol
low the orders given by the officers.
The woods had not been reeonnoltered
previous to lanaing. They had not even
been fired into by way of precaution.
Nevertheless, this handful of s ddiers
at once commenced skirmishing into
the unknown, and Boon enough the bul
lets commenced to sing about our ears.
These were not picked m . They
were taken as they happened to come.
The commander did not ask _for volun
teers to start from Tampa or even for
the first landing party. He had to se
lect men to puli tho sweeps not because
any were more brave than the rest, but
Kply for knowledge of rowing. Ev
man who was In that fight on that
was intelligent enough to know
t his chances of seein o home again
c hopel'sely small. The mere Idea
landing fifty men on an unknown
beach In the neighborhood oi a strong
Â£ -rrloon was enough to stamp the en-
I prise as equal in danger to that of
lutenant H< bson, who corked the
â¢bor of Santiago by sinking the Mer
iac Jn the channel undor fire from
Spanish forts.
Ty secret of this peculiarly Ameri
1 attitude toward danger is in the
Dit our men have of acting Individ
ually. The American hatituai.v takes
care of himself where the Euro-- in is
Ie apt to invoke the aid of a police
i. The American of the T'estern
t of this country is not pr.ne to risk
rights to the slow and iickle justice
he law courts, especially where the
ge is suspc "ed of political ambition,

abstract but carries a sixshooter in
case of accident.
This forlorn hope of flf:y men was
attacked from in ambush by a .orce
estimated at several hundred. It might
have been several thousand for aught
these men cared. They hr.d a splendid
opportunlt for running away in a pan
ic. They were In a thick forest, where
they could see but little of the enemy
ana still less of their fellows. They
had reason to think they might be cut
off from their boats, and they knew
that if they reach the beach alive
the boats on ;and were not .nough to
hold them all. They were not fighting
elbow to elbow, and the rattle of the
enemy's bullets was painfully sharp
and continuous.
If I heard It once I heard it . dozen
times amon the regulars in and about
Tampa, "What is this war about, any
way?" The idea of liberating Cubans
or negroes did not to them seem to be
a very good one.
There was not, so far as I could dis
cover, any particular enthusiasm for
the cause in which they were nominally
enlisted. But it was grand sport and
they went at it with the same gusto
that they woijJ have exhibited if or
dered to exterminate Apaches or grizzly
bears. And he c lies the essential dif
ference between the professional and
the volunteer in this war. The regu
lar is invincibly brave from sheer force
of habit. He is incapable of panic, as
he is incapab!^ of vulgar pacsions. lie
kills his Spaniards as his surgeon am
putates a lep, but he does not neces
sarily hate the man he kills. He loves
the Spaniard who shoots straight. On
the contrary he despises only the
enemy who gives him an easy job. He
fights for the sheer iove of fighting.
i'he regular West Point officer is at
the bottom of this holy joy of warfare.
He is a man who soldiers adore. They
know that he knows lots of mysterious
things about theodolites, transit ma
chinory, sextants and cube ro.'ts. He
looks like a dandy when he arrives
fresh from the "Point," but for all that
he cannot be humbugged. The same
men who shirk their work under old
political coKmels sudd nly straighten
up when they have to do with a young
West Point lieutenant. That landing
near Cabanas could not have been
made had the leaders been other than
West Pointers. This does not mean
that other men may not have exhibited
equal courage under other conditions.
Here, however, panic an 1 massacre
were averted solely because each sol
dier knew that his offices was to be
trusted, and each officer knew that he
had complete moral ascendency over
the men under him.
Now, "West Point does not graduate
either cowards or fools, and soldiers
have consequently conceived a groat
respect for officers from tbat school.
It is a very unpopular school with pro
fessional politicians, for there is no
room there for the exercise of political
favoritism. We notice that there is
just now a disposition to weaken the
regular regiments by drawing away
from them the younger officers to serve
on the staff of volunteer organizations.
This is a cruel injustice to the regular
army, and it is done in order to weaken
it and to make it appear as though the
volunteers could accomplish Just as
much as the old seasoned regulars.
The regular army needs all its West
Pointers in this hour of national strain,
for the courage of the re.ular private
is the confluence he feels in the 6fncer
who leads him In battle. Take the
same men who behaved so nobly in the
fight I have just referred to and place
them under political captains and lieu
tenants and I doubt if they would have
stood their ground. They might have
shot their officers in the back, and I,
for one, could not have blamed them
very seriously. We are doing a very
dangerous thing In tampering for po
litical purpos with the organization
of the regular army. We are forgetting
that the efnoL-.icy of troops is based
upon the respect of men for their offi
cers and the corresponding confidence
of officers in their men. Once weaken
this bond and you produce a state of
things t' at can be compared only with
a ship whose crew has lost confidence
in the men on the bridge.

WILL STARTLE THE BIRDS
ON LONELY
CLIPPERTON ISLAND,
LIVING as we do In the midst of
daily din of battles, both by
war's alarms many things now
adays get overlooked which at
a more peaceful time would ex
cite great public interest. The
land and sea, leaves the newspapers
little room to chronicle the minor
| events of business life. So while thou-
I Bands crowded the sea wall and the
! docks to cheer the third expedition on
: its way to Manila, but few noticed an
I innocent, little steam schooner, which
j lay, as if to escape observation, at the
i furthest end of the Vallejo-street
j wharf.
She is not a pretty boat, this Alice
Blanchard; her round heavy stern sits
low in the water, her -white painted
spar deck gives her a top-heavy ap
pearance, her battered sides and chafed
planking show that she has been noth
ing but a marine drudge, a humble un
obtrusive cargo boat. But probabaly
she is good enough to make Clipperton
Island and load guano, as that is all
she is required for. There are many
signs of her mission to be seen about.
The upper deck is being fitted with
bunks, exactly after the not too luxu
rious fashion of a United States trans
port. The wharf is crowded with mis
cellaneous stores, boxes and barrels of
all kinds are scattered about, and two
huge flat-bottomed surf boats, heavily
planked and built to stand hammering
on a coral reef, have just been deliv
ered by a local builder. But most prom
ient of all is a couple of huge iron
mooring buoys, looking exactly like the
boilers of a large steamer. There are
enormous rings round the buoys, car
rying heavy shackles to 'hich a vessel
may make fast, and the mooring cable
stretched alongside is of the heaviest
make and best quality.
All these things mean the expendi
ture of much money, but the enterprise
has been taken in hand by men of mil
lions, accustomed to dealing in large
sums. Clipperton Island, in the next
few years, will have more money spent
' upon it than during the whole of its
I barren existence. Its fortune has
i turned, the rock hitherto deemed val
! ueless is to be a busy place, and will
; doubtless put much gold into the pock
1 ets of its English owners.
During the past year a good many
! peo-ple have heard of Clipperton, be
: cause of the curious dispute as to the
1 island's ownership. In fact, the mat
| ter la still shrouded in the mists of
: doubt, though as far as the guano seek
: ers are concerned, nationality is a sub
ject of indifference. The island was
discovered by an Englishman, Captain
Clipperton. therefore some say it should
| be English.
It is believed that the United States
i Government does not intend to contest
i the Mexican claim, at any rate all the
I negotiations for the present enterprise
! have been carried on with Mexico. The
; Pacific Islands Company, which has ac-
I quired the right to strip Clipperton of
I its rich guano deposits, is a very
| wealthy London corporation. Titled
! men are on Its board of directors, as
well as members of some of the wealth
; lest shipping firms in the citj\ Its af
; fairs here have been managed by a
I well known traveler of the South Seas,
; Mr. J. T. Arundel, who has spent the
i last few months going to and fro on the
| Pacific, looking after the vast interests
I which his company holds in all parts
iof the ocean. Naturally, the Clipper
ton enterprise concerns San Francisco
chiefly, as the nearest commercial cen
ter, though some of the guano may be
shipped to Honolulu, and some even
j sent to Europe in sailing vessels.
The water front, which is always cu
rious in matters of this kind, has seen
nothing of the men who are to do the
; hard work of this expedition. Eighty
1 Japanese laborers were Imported from
'â  Honolulu. They came up in the Peru,
; and as soon as the steamer arrived,
! were hurried off to quarantine at Angel
j Island. It is risky work bringing these
men here, because under tho United
: States law their contracts are worth
i less. The company, even though it paid
I the passages, hart no legal claim on the
services of its laborers, and if the men
had been landed in San Francisco no
; one could have preseventcd their walk
! ing away at their own sweet will.
Fortunately the action of the medical
l officers In placing the Japs in quaran
1 tine relieved the company from this
| difficulty, and when the Alice Blanch
1 aid moved out into the stream the la
j borers were quietly put on board with

NEWSPAPER LIFE
AT THE SEAT OF WAR
Lively Experiences of the Correspondents
With the Spaniards, the Rations and That
Terrible Creature, the Press Censor.
From The Call Special War Correspondence.
CERTAINLY as far as numbers
go, we war correspondents at- :
tached to the headquarters of |
the American army for the in
vasion of Cuba are an uncom
monly strong lot. There are over
seventy of us here already, and it is
said that passes have been issued by
the War Department to as mt-y mure
who are still to come. Even . all of us
do not go to Cubaâ and as things look
now it is possible that senile decay may
thin our ranks somewhat before the ex
pedition finally sailsâ still there may j
survive a hundred or so of us; and a
solid phalanx of a hundred war corre
spondents ought to be enough to
achieve all tha^ any general can rea
sonably desire in th 2 way of flowing
celebration of his exploits.
There can be no doubt that there will j
be quite enough of us for the work.
The only fear is t. at when the fighting
begins it will be impossible to see the |
battle for the war correspondents. As
to our many great talents, they re
main to be proved, but it has already
been clearly established that nothing
in the way of facts will pass unre
corded. We shall clear the battle
ground of facts as clearly as a patent
carpet sweeper.
Here, while we are waiting to begin,
nothing â not the smallest incident â es
capes us, however secret it may be.
The other day one of the series of little
expeditions for the carriage of stores
and ammunition to the Cuban insur- |
gents left here on a steamer called the
Gussie. It was, of course, most secret
ly despatched. The first essential to its
success was that Its going shn"M be
known only to those on board and to
the insurgents who were to meet it.
But, close secret as it was, it did not
escape us.
Sixty odd war correspondents scooped
it up, and on the morning of the day
upon which the Gussie sailed every i
newspaper in America contained a dou- j
ble column headline account of it, de-
Bcribing the purpose of the undertak
ing, the time at which it would prob
ably start, the spot on the Cuban coast
at which the stores were to be landed,
with complete particulars as to the ar
mament of the ship and the strength of
the force she carried.
The Spaniards may not be able to
I shoot very well, but some of them can
; read. And when the Gussie reached
the Cuban coast and prepared to land
her cargo she was surprised to find
that a considerable force of Spanish
j soldiers had been posted there to wait
i for her. She had a very narrow escape
i from a very tight place.
It Is quite clear that whatever may he
| our competence \,>r dealing with them,
! the facts will w 1 escape us. When after
! the crestfallen â¢ -.turn of the expedition
, we were reproached with having caused
Its failure we replied with great dignity
that since the le ader of the expedition
! had been guilty of the unwarrantable
! favoritism of giving permission to two
j only of our number to accompany him
I it was the manifest duty of the rest of
! us to knock the stuffing out of the out
' fit. When in reply to that it was? urged
| that this did not justify our disclosing
1 secret movements of the army to the
I the enemy we contemptuously inquired
| whether any one thought that we were
out here for our healths.
The outcome of this was the estab
i lishment of a censorship. All news dis-
I patches have now to be aprrÂ°ved and
j Initialed before they will be accepted
lat the telegraph office. The censor has
jmy sincere sympathy. Tliere is only
one of him. With sixty edd ravenous
newspatherers on the spot five censors
â would have been no morÂ«J than a fair
allowance. But only one has been ap
pointed. He is Lieutenant Mylie, a
ant and courteous young officer, who
acts as one of General Shafter's aids.
Since he began to carefully read line
by line sixty odd dispatches a day a
look of gloomy despondency has been
fettling on his oountenance, the bright
glow of soldierly enthusiasm which ne ;..
wore a week ago has disappeared,. : ahd
he pathetically' murmurs that this' is-,
magnificent, but it is- not war.. ;
I do not know whether tr> he sorry,
most for the censor or for the trans
port officer. Every one of the author
ized correspondents is entitled to trans-,
port for himself, his baggage and his.,
horse, and with regard to baggage
every one of us is a complete little,
military expedition in â¢ himself- There
are only about a dozen transport yes- . .
dels waiting down at the portl After.,
we have been accommodated' 'l really
cannot imagine how the army : Is .going
to manage. We should not have-been
so heavily equipped, if It; had. not been .
for the time, we have had in -which to
think of things we could, not Jjc^sibly â 
do without. ' â¢ . : . â 
You see, we have Just been sitting.;
here day after day for three- ...weeks: .
among the palm trees with nothing- in ;
the world to do except to wait for- meal
times and to-morrow's n;ivai .engage.-/
ment which never comes off. : In fact,
we have been leading, ladies' .11 ves,.:.and â¢â 'â 
naturally enough. we have sought tha;.;
feminine solace of shopping. â 'â 'â ."'.â â 
It is a pity that some great.philoso
pher has not been here to observe us.
We should have supplied him with ma
terials for a convincing chapter, oft. the
enervating influences of Idleness.
When we first came here, alii in dusty
eagerness, from the North, -we Vied
with one another in a severe Spartan
simplicity. The O'Shaughnesgy, from
Chicago, took us up to his room and
proudly exhibited his kitâ another .pair
of socks, another shirt, two handker
chiefs, a cake of soap and a blanket,
all wrapped up in a water-proof sheet;
tied with rope; that, in addition to
what he stood up in and what he car
ried in his pocket, constituted his outfit.
The waterproof sheet, h-e explained, .
not only served as a wrapping for his
kit but in combination with a heap of
brushwood which he would cut with
his jackknife would constitute his bed .
and his canopy when the rainy, season
in Cuba should set in. He rather apolo
gized for the soap; it would be handy,
he explained, for washing his clothes,
in case such a proceeding should be
come desirable; moreover, he confessed
shamefacedly that on the day upon .
which we made our triumphal entry
into Havana he had a dandified notfon
of washing himself. But he put himself
right with us on this point when Some
one tauntingly said:
"Anyway, what's the good of soap
unless you carry a towel along?"
"Towels!" said the vVShaughnessy,
contemptuously â "towels! Did ever
any one hear of a man needing a towel
when he'd got another shirt?"
I was secretly conscious of the. pos
session of a kitbag with all Borts of
wildly absurd things in it, such as a
comb and brush, and a patent safety
razor, andâ shall I admit It?â a folding
shaving mirror; so next morning I
severely edited my outfit and packed a
big parcel back to New York.
But Sparta was not the starting point .
of the Gulf Stream, and I doubt
whether the Spartan warriors had their
headquarters in a pleasure : resort
hotel, with table d'hote three times- a
day and nothing to do for long, lang
uorous ..eeks. One morning Rathom
of San Francisco, who had been
stretched out in a rocking chair, wear
ily fanning himself with his hat,,
jumped up suddenly and said, With de
termination:
"Say, boys, I can't stand this any
longer. I am going out somewhere to
do something." .
He strode out fiercely,, and in an hour
or two came back looking very hot and
dusty and said, "I've been for a ride."
"On the trolley car?" we asked jeer
"Trolley car be hanged," he sa,ld.
"I've bought a horse.
A horse. We pricked up our ears.
Rathom has bought a horse. That
was an Incidentâ an adventure,, if you
like. And, after all, a horse was a very
suitable thing for a war correspondent
to possess. The cavalry had horses,
and most of the officers, too, and to
keep pace with the officers or to prop
erly observe the conduct of a cavalry
charge a horse was desirable, and in
fact necessary.
Some of us thought a well acclimated
Cuban mule would be more reliable, es
pecially for mountain fighting, but the
balance of opinion was that the horse
was the nobler animal and much more
useful when it became a question of
getting down to the coast with the first
news of a victory.
So we rose with resolution and went
out buying horses.
That afternoon there was a grand
collection of horses standing- in charge
of long-faced horsecopers under
the chade of the grove of palm trees
in front of the hotel and market prices
went up with a bound. It was not long
before the horse dealers began to be
ashamed of their earlier moderation.
They grew very independent, and the
appearance of some of the horses they
brought al>ng was nothing less than an
insolence. At first so long as the local
stock held out the favorite description
of a horse was that he wag "accli
mated."
"Say, mistuh." said the dealers, with
their languid Southern drawl, "yo doen
wawnt er hawse as is suah ter pull
himself ter pieces In er week; yo
wawnt er hawse er is acclimated.
Heahs one raised right heah suah, and
es good es he waws Cuby bawn."
The word "acclimated 1 ' captured us
all. and we Jed our prizes to the livery
stable, where rates Jumped up fifty per
cent in two hours.
After the surplus supply had been
exhausted they began to fetch horses
out of milk carts â gentle, contempla
tive chargers, which, when you were
riding them, would stop from force of
haMt whenever they came to a house.
Then they began to import horses from
gradually ascending Northern lati
tudes, first from Jacksonville, then
from Middle Georgia and Tennespee
and Kentucky â "the blue graws coun
try, mlstuh," they explained, "where
de racehawses i* raised."
THE DEFENSE OF HONGKONG.
!Lord Charles Beresford, speaking at
York at the beginning of last month,
very appropriately drew attention to
the unsatisfactory condition of Hong
kong from a military point of view.
There Is no subject on which her Maj
esty's Ministers, to whichever party
they belong, speak more freely than on
the defense of our coaling stations, and
year after year large sums have been
voted for the Improvement of our mili
tary works at Hongkong. Year after
year the same statement is made, too,
that owing to some unexpected Inter
vention the works had not been com
pleted as Intended, but the Government
now had them in hand, etc. Still, little
or nothing has come of this and Hong
kong Is practically dependent on the
fleet for its defense. This Is becoming
a more serious matter than ever, now
that Russia has been put In poasgasion
of Port Arthur, and Is there in her own
Interest taking similar precautionsUnique case of a clergyman who lost his mine
through an accident and lived in double con
sciousness for a long time.
"Mr. Hanna regards the history of his life before the
accident as an experience that has occurred within the life of
quite another person. The accident may be considered as the
boundary, line separating- two distinct lives of the same in
dividual. What happened before the accident is unknown to
the personality formed after the accident. Two different selves
seem to dwell within Mr. Hanna. It seems to be a case of
double consciousness, and the patient is now in the secondary
Btate." â Extract from the report of Dr. Boris Sidis.
THIS is the. strange story of a man
of good faculties who lost his
mental self through an accident,
I with a double consciousness
for weeks and was Orally led back
to his original mental self by love and
science.
The strange case of Rev. Mr. Hanna
Is really a triumph for scienceâprob
ably the greatest triumph ever
achieved in medico-psychology : and
aside from an achievement in restoring
the mental faculties of a man whose
mind had become a blank is the added
Interest which cannot be dissociated
from the study of a case so strange, so
puzzling and so absolutely without a
In brief, it is a case not alone involv
ing loss of memory as the result of an
injury to the headâ that in itself is not
of unusual occurrence. In this instance
a double consciousness ensued, which
really amounted to a dual personality.
The Rev. Mr. Hanna did not suffer
from â â . Something merely
snapped in his head, and his memory
was gone. He became as a new born
babe. He remembered nothing, of what
had occurred previous to the accident
that had robbf 1 him of his reasoning
faculties. His parents, his friends, even
his fiancee, all were as strangers to
him. The windows of his soul were
clouded. He had to begin life anew.
And last Tuesday he was married to
the girl he loved since boyhood, the girl
who had passed out of his life as com
pletely as though the grave had claim
ed her, but whose tender solicitation
and great love had at last conquered.
At the time he met with the acci
dent that made, his mind a blank he
was preaching in the Plantsville Bap
tist Church. That was April 15, 1897.
Mr. Hanna was . driving with his
brother on that afternoon when a
â wheel struck a stone. Mr. Hanna was
thrown from th-\ wagon. He struck
with considerable force pn his head. He
was unconscious when his brother
picked him : up. NOt far distant .was

remained urn onseious for two
hours. Then he opened his eyes. As
he sat. talking in- the wagon. he was a
man of ripe learning for his years,
versed in classics, in philosophy, in
theology. When" he opened his eyes in
Miss Cook's home he was as lacking in
knowledge- as when he first came into
the world,' â  'â¢ â¢
He looked at those, about him won
deringly. His eyes had the steadfast,
wise stare of a baby. The rise and fall
of his chest, caught his gaze. It sur
prised and then fascinated, him. To
his new-born intelligence it was a won

the Declaration of Independence,

demonstrations 'of joy upoff the una

On' July 9 Washington himself di
rected- th=e celebration which was held
in New York. The declaration was read
in the presence -of the army, and the
assembled people indulged in displays
very like those of. the preceding day in
Philadelphia, although the New York
celebration went, a -step farther, for in
their enthusiasm the people tore down,
beheaded and rpelted the statue of
George 111 in Bowling Green, "the
troopa.-long having had an inclination
bo' to. do." â¢-
The newÃ was hurried forward to
Boston, and the. messengers made such
derstand. The voices were to him a
jumble of noi<. a.
A great awe came over Miss Cook
and the others about the afflicted man.
There had arisen before them a condi
tion that stunned them. His sweet
heart spoke to the young man in tones
that a few hours before would have
thrilled him, but which then conveyed
nothing to him.
He was motionless save for the in
voluntary muscles. He was in the full
jHissession of his strength, but he could
not move. He did not know how.
For hours Mr. Hanna lay motionless.
He watched the doctors. One of them
moved his hand in gesturing. The imi
tative faculty, the first characteristic
in the human mind, was aroused. Mr.
Hanna tried to move his arm. It
waved up and down. It delighted him.
He moved it faster and faster. One of
the doctors was struck by it with con
siderable force. The doctor imagined
he was being attacked and grasped the
arm.
Mr. Hanna logan moving the other
one. He could not understand why
they should try to hold him. It was
fine to wave his arms. He exerted all
his great strength and then he was
bound hand and f< ><>t.
Mr. Hanna showed no resentment.
He realized that he was being treated
roughly, and it showed in his face.
}'r ssently th*Â» bonds were removed.
Again he began moving his arms.
Miss Cook offered him a glass of
water. He made no sign. She drank
herself, and he imitated her, at first
with much difficulty.
Food was offered him. It meant
nothing to his mind. And he craved
foodâ the specialists who afterward at
tended him said so.
Mr. Hanna could not eat the delicious
food about him because he did not
know how to eat. Again his fiancee be
came his teacher.
She took an apple and bit into it.
Ph<? hir.d<=>d him the apple and he ate
it. carefully watching her the while.
Soap and water were placed beside
him while his face was being bathed.
He picked up the piece of soap and bit
into that, but spat it out quickly
enough.
The young man was in bed two days.
He did not know enough to got up. and
they did not understand his malady.
At the end of that time he was dressed
and raised from his bed. A man stood
on either side and tried to walk him
alone.
He did not know how to control his
loirs and sank to the floor. Speedily
he began to imitate his attendants.
Within a few minutes he found that he
could stand. The floor troubled him.
He could not tell where it was. It
seemed directly against his eyes. He
felt his way as a man does in the dark.
When he looked up he started back
affrighted. He thought he was running
into the wall twenty feet away.
That night he saw a star. He renched
for it a hundred times. He could not
understand why he could not grasp it.
In the day he reached for distant trees.
At the end of two days Miss Cook
realised that her fiancee must be
tausht as a child without knowledge,
without experience. Her quick wit
made her appreciate that the first ne
incredibly fast time that they arrived
on the 18th of July. The people were
dressed in their â¢'holiday suits" and
with the soldiers thronged the streets.
Exactly at 1 o'clock Thomas Crafts
arose In the Town House and readaloud
the declaration, and the men stood up
and repeated the words of their offi
cers and swore to uphold the rights <>f
their country. The Town Clerk read the
â declaration from a balcony to the
crowd, "at the close of which a shout,
begun in the hall, passed to the streets,
which rang with loud huzzas, the slow
and measured boom of cannon and the
rattle of musketry." Then there was a
â banquet in the Council chamber, "to
which nl! the richer citizens were in
vited," while great quantities of liquor
were distributed among the people, and
In the evening there was a general
illumination of the entire town. There
wna no statue of Kirer George to be
broken, but the people did the next best
thing, for they tore down the lion and
the unicorn from the east wing of the
State House.
â¢ One of the unpublished letters of
John Adams jrives the following, de
scription: The thought of taking any
notice of this day was not conceived
until the second 6f th<* month and was
not mentioned until the third. It was
too late to have a sermon, as every
one wished, so this must he de'^rred
to another year. Congress determined
to adjourn over that day and to dine
together. The general officers and oth
ers in town were invited, after the
President and Council and Board of

cesslty was to instruct him so that he
could make known his needs. She gave
him a drink of water.
"This is water," she said slowly.
"Water," repeated Mr. Hanna,
thickly.
He did not forget. He never forgot
anything that was told him. It dawned
upon those about him that while he was
wholly lacking in knowledge, while his
mind was clear of all impressions, like
that of a babe, he possessed the intelli-
gence of a man of 25 of unusual capa
city.
Then Miss Cook began a systematic
course of instruction. T*ie local doc
tors said that Mr. Hanna could not re
cover, and that he must learn every
thing over again. But the young
woman did not believe that fate could
be so cruel.
She gave up her whole life to him.
She spent hours in teaching him to
talk, instructing him in the things that
any child knows and of which he was
totally ignorant.
She taught him to write. She would
write a sentence and he would copy it,
using either hand with the same awk
wardness. In his normal state he had
never been ambidexterous.
He had to learn to interpret every
thing. He was in a world new and
strange to him. He was like a man
transferred to another planet where
the manner of communication, the peo
ple, the objects and the whole environ
ment were unlike anything he had seen
or dreamed of in his former existence.
There was no external change in him.
He looked as he always did. But he
had lost his old mannerisms, although
his tastes wen 1 not dissimilar. He
talked in the s^me way, although there
were strange gaps in his conversation
where his knowledge was incomplete.
He learned to read in three weeks,
but his lack of collateral knowledge
made much that he read a blank.
HAIL! THE ERA OF GOOD FEELING
By Congressman Cannon, Chairman House Coromlttee on Appropriations.
IN answer to an Inquiry on the floor of the House I said
the other clay that the war would cost in neighborhood
of $600,000,000 if it should last one year. If it lasts three
times as long and costs ten times as much it will be
worth it all in the new feeling of unity and amity
with which it has permeated the whole country and the
new vista which it opens before the American people. From
present indications I believe that this war may be succeeded
by another "era of good-feeling" such as that which fol
lowed the war of 1812, in Monroe's time, continued Mr.
Cannon. I do not mean necessarily that the exact condi
tions are to be repeated or that party lines will b wiped
out. But it looks as though there would be a renewal of
unity and good fee'.i^~ such as has not been witnessed in
American politics since the slavery question came into
prominence.
The first requisite for an "era of good feeling" is general
prosperity. Our agricultural interest:, seem to be entering
upon a period of general improvement and revival, and the
close of the war will give a great impetus to American com
merce, especially in the direction of foreign trade.
Unless some unexpected catastr he intervenes to change
the present trend of events this means prosperity, good
times and consequent good-feeling. For another thing, we
shall have at the close of the war new interests. Our at
tention will be drawn from ourselves outside our present
borders, and we shall therefore be more ready to forget our
present differences. Whatever may te the true solution of
the problems which will confront the country when the
present war lias come to a close, their final disposition will
require the united wisdom of the people's leaders. I be
lieve that when the time for such action comes the United
War of this State. In the morning the
Delaware frigate, several lar^-o "'alleys
and other continental armed vessels.
the Pennsylvania ship and row galleys
and guard boats were all hauled off
into the river and several of them were
dressed in the colors of all nations, dis
played above the masts, yards and rig
ging. At 1 o'clock the ships were all
manned; that is the men were all or
dered aloft and arranged urÂ»on the top
yards and shrouds. makin~ a striking
appearance of men drawn up in order
in the air. Then I went on board the
Delaware with the President and sev
eral gentlemen of the marine commit
tee, soon after which we were saluted
with a discharge of thirteen guns,
which was followed by thirteen others
from each of the armed vessels in the
river, then the galleys followed the
fire and after them the gunboats. Then
He possessed the power of inductive
and deductive reasoning within the
compass of his knowledge. But his
lark of experience and of precedents
placed him at a loss. Tet he thirsted
for knowledge.
"While Mr. Hanna was In this state
he had no realization of God. There
was no innate religious feeling, as it
is ordinarily understood. But the soul
of the man was pure. He turned from
the ugly, the deformed, the evil with
distrust. His sense of the beautiful was
developed acutely.
As the days passed, those about Mr.
Hanna lost hope of his recovery, all
but the devoted woman who had
promised to be his bride. No one can
knew the misery she suffered during 1
those days of constant attendance upon
the man who had asked her to marry
him, who had loved her with all the
force of a strong nature, and who now
looked upon her with gentle indiffer
ence.
But she kept on. instructing hi- day
by day, doing her best to arouse the
sleeping memory. He learned to play
the piano with considerable skill. He
learned to play the banjo excellently
well, although formerly he had never
attempted to master the instrument.
His education moved swiftly, but un
less he could be broueht back to his
normal self it would take years to
make him as he was before the fall.
When his father and mother came to
him Mr. Hanna waited to be intro
duced. Then he greeted them politely.
Their tears and caresses meant noth
ing to him. He did not know who they
were. They, too, gave up hope after a
week.
Mr. Hanna has an uncle in New York
whose name is familiar through his
church on South Washington Square,
the Rev. A. P. Judson. Through him a
physician was consulted.
States (and by that I mean the people of the United States)
will have a policy definite and decisive in dealing with the
situation.
But I would not base my prediction of an era of good
feeling merely on the prospect of material prosperity. It is
my :-elief that the present universal manifestation of pa
triotism and good will witnessed throughout the country
is not merely a sudd-n outburst destined to lie v thin a
few week or months, but a deep-seated and lasting feeling.
It is the growth of years at last finding Its expression and
recognition in the necessities of resistance to a foreign foe.
The men and women of the younger generation who have
grown up since the close of the civil war cannot appreciate
what a really wonderful thing it is. Only those of us whose
memories extend back beyond that dire conflict which
strained the national fabric almost to the breaking point can
fully realize how deep were the wounds that have been
healed and how fierce the passions that have been calmed.
I believe that the United SU-tes stands absolutely alone as
a nation, which, after its people hay engaged in a death
grapple which shook the national structure to its founda
tion, has been able to forgive and forget all the animosities
engendered by that conflict within the life-time of the men
who participated in it.
This, it Beems to me, is tl ? ihlr.g which we should cele
brate and over which we should rejoice on the Fourth of
July, 1898. I thank God that I have lived to see this day.
I congratulate the North and the South and the whole coun
try upon it. The spectacle of the veterans of Blue and Gray
marching shoulder to shoulder, of Fitzhugh Lee and Joe
Wheeler and Miles and Merrltt fighting under the same flag
and for their common country is to my mind the best Fourth
of July procession we have had for fifty years.

Love and science grapple with the problem
and after patient work restore the injured
mind to its normal condition.
Dr. S. P. Goodhart, the attending
physician in the department of nervous
diseases in Bellevue College, who had
supplemented his studies in America by
a long course In Berlin, Vienna and
Heidelberg, was asked to make an ex
amination. Dr. Boris Sidis, associate
in psychology in the Pathological In
stitute of the New York State hospi
tals, was afterward summoned as an
expert. They went to Plantsvllle fiva
weeks after Mr. Hanna's fall. _Â
They made a careful investigation.
Dr. Goodhart's clinical examination
disclosed that there was no sign of
fracture of skull or of lesion of any
kind.
They said the patient was suffering
from amnesia. That is the technical
term for loss of memory, and those
about Mr. Hanna knew that this was
his trouble. But with the scientists it
meant much more. They had a certain
definite grasp of the cause of the
trouble, and they believed that the
young clergyman could be cured.
They made no promises. They knew
they were entering upon strange fields.
Here is an extract from Dr. Sidis's
notes taken at the time:
"Mr. Hanna regards the history of hi 3
life before the accident as an experi
ence that has occurred within the life
of quite another person. The accident
may be considered as the boundary line
separating two distinct lives of the
same individual. What happened be
fore the accident is unknown to the
personality formed after the accident.
Two different selves seem to dwell
within Hanna. It seems to be a case
of double consciousness, and the patient
is now in a secondary state."
It is difficult for the lay mind to un
derstand exactly what happened to Mr.
Hanna. The scientists explain swiftly
enough, but the ordinary mind cannot
penetrate these psychological mazes. It

The anniversaries had been cele
brated in the army by the discharge of
guns, the setting free of prisoners, and
festivities in which the wives of the
generals had been very active, Mrs.
Knox and Mrs. Greene being especially
interested. The year when peace was
declared witnessed the introduction of
the oration. Guns and bells, of course,
continued to be much in evidence, and
toasts were drunk and responded to at
the dinners, which were provided on
every village green or city common.

Unprecedented in medical science is the remarkable case
of the llev. Thomas C. Hanna, who developed a double person
ality as the result of a fall, living two separate and distinct
lives, and finally being restored to his normal condition. No
similar cure has ever before been effected. Aside from the
scientific aspect of the case is a strange romance which ended
last Tuesday in the merry peal of wedding bells.
should be borne in mind that there was
no functional injury to Mr. Hanna's
brain. The trouble may be explained
thus:
"The trouble was caused by the cleav
age of the association cells of the brain.
These cells are connected with each
other and with the brain centers by
prolongations, or little arms. The as
sociation cells are the channels of com
munication. Mr. Hanna's fall detached
these arm?. Thus everything relating
to past events that brought them into
relation with the upper consciousness,
the ego of the man, was suddenly cut
off. These memories sank into the sub
conscious regions."
It is like breaking an electric current,
this snapping of the little arms con
necting these millions of microscopic
cells.
At the instant the diagnosis was
made the doctors had determined upon
the treatment. They realized that it
was necessary to connect the arms of
the cells, to make the circuit complete.
They knew that the memory, that is to
say the association ceils, were not dead
but dormant. As they express it they
were in the sub-conscious regions.
And what think you was the question
they asked most eagerly and listened
to with the keenest attention?
They directed Mr. Hanna to tell them
of his dream.
They did not ask him if he had
dreamed, they were sure of that. He
told them he had two kinds of dreams,
"clear picture dreams," "visions," as
Mr. Hanna characterized them, and the
ordinary dreams to which most people
are subject. The "visions" were pic
tures of Mr. Hanna's former life.
These visions were of the deepest in
terest to the doctors. They knew that
the sub-consciousness was asserting it
self while the afflicted man was asleep
and the upper consciousness was ior
mant.
The physicians directed Mr. Hanna to
come to New York. Dr. Goodhart took
him to his house at 133 East Sixty-first
street. There he was kept under con
stant observation night and day. From
the moment the scientists first saw him
until they pronounced him cured one
or the other was constantly with him.
At the end of the first week in New
York a great change came over Mr.
Hanna, and he furnished the most per
fect illustration of alternating con
sciousness that is recorded by science.
So skillfully did the physicians develop
the sub-consciousness that it began to
assert itself at different times. It was
about noon one day in Dr. Goodhart's
office that Mr. Hanna fell into a sleep.
Half an hour later he awoke and his
primary self was in control. He was
the Rev. Mr. Hanna, the Baptist clergy
man, the university man, familiar with
Hebrew and Greek, with his mind per
fectly clear and conscious of all that
had happened up to the time of his
accident. He *.vanted to know about
his fiancee, about his friends, about a
thousand things. For half an hour he
was his old self.
CELEBRATIONS
SINCE 1776.
corn and vegetables of the season"
were piled upon the tables and were
free to all, while firewater as well as
fireworks abounded. The introduction
of the "oration," however, chiefly dis
tinguishes the celebration of 1783, and
dates from that time.
This was the "Jubilee." and was the
most elaborate of all celebrations up to
that time. Three of the signers of the
Declaration were still living, although
the weakness of old age prevented
them from taking an active part in the
festivities. The struggle of the South
American countries to throw off the
yoke of Spain and the popular sym
pathy with Greece helped to inspire the
American people. Bands, bells, can
non and processions abounded, and the
oration held a conspicuous part. Jo
siah Quincy was the orator in Boston,
Edward Everett in Cambridge, while in
Washington an "honorable number"
delivered a great speech before a
greater crowd from the steps of the
Capitol. New York had not yet made
so much of the oration as had some of
the other cities, but did not lack in en
thusiasm. A long procession marched
from the Battery to Washington square
and was there reviewed .by De Witt
Clinton, the Governor of the State.
Ten thousand people were in the as
sembly and aided in disposing of the
"ox feast" which had been provided.
The enthusiasm throughout the land
was intense. The "Monroe doctrine,"
the "liberty of man," "the oppression of
effete monarchies" were expressions
used not only by the orator-* but by
all men. Doubtless the "jubilee ' pro
There was joy in the house in Berling
street, Southington, when Miss Clark
received that good news.
But the primary condition lasted not
more than twenty minutes. Mr. Hanna
fell into a short sleep, and again he
was another being â the man whose ex
istence dated from April 17, 1597.
From that time on until he returned
home first one consciousness and then
the other asserted itself. Neither ego
was conscious of the other. In one
state he had no realization of the other.
But the periods of primary conscious
ness grew longer and longer, due to the
psychological and chemical stimuli that
were given him. Surely no scientists
ever watched a more interesting strug
gle than the clash of these two person
alities in one man. They were bending
their energies, their skill, their knowl
edge to weld the two, watching each
breath of the patient, each flutter of an
eyelid. For three or four days Mr.
Hanna never passed from one state to
another without sleep intervening, a
hypnoleptic state as it is called, a
period when he was wholly unconscious.
The day came when the two con-
sciousnesses met on common ground.
The young man had a realization of his
former life and of what had occurred
since the accident. Everything came
back to him. The flood of memories
stunned him for a time. The whote
world was strange and confused. The
billions of tiny brain cells were work
ing with tremendous activity.
Then the doctors knew that their
work was done. They had brought
about the cure in exactly two weeks.
Mr. Hanna was directed to return to
Southington. No man may know what
Jtook . place when he saw his fiancee
again, but every woman who feared
she had lost the man whom she loves
better than her life may appreciate
something of the Joy of Anna Clark
Cook when her sweetheart took her in
his arms.
But Mr. Hanna was not wholly re
covered. He was like a man who had
passed months in total darkness and
suddenly came into dazzling light He
was dazed and confused. No human
being could pass through so terrible
an experience and come forth unaffect
ed by it. Each day it became clearer
and sweeter to him.
For a time he lived in fear that the
cure was not permanent, but as the
months passed he gained complete con
fidence. He accepted a call in Union
City, where he is now the pastor of the
Baptist Church.
And as for Miss Cook, surely no
â¢woman was ever more deserving of her
great joy than she. whose trust and
confidence were so steadfast when they
passed through the shadows darker
than death.
There was a wedding in Plantsville
last Monday, and all the countryside
crowded into the church to see Mr.
Hanna and Miss Cook made man and
wife. They rejoiced with them. The
.bridegroom's father performed the
ceremony, and one of the ushers was

For the first thirteen centuries of the Christian era

East, says the Freeman's Journal. Toward the middle
of the fourteenth century it was brought from Cyprus
to the West by Godfrey, Count of Charny. in Bour
gogne, who deposited it in his castle of Sirey, near
Trove, and founded a canonical chapter to guard it.
At Blrey it remained until 1418, when Champagne being
harassed by war and the precious relic in danger of
profanation, the canons requested Humbert della

to take it into his custody in his castle of Monfort, in
Bourgogne, together with some other relics.

This he proceeded to do. "When he

excited Imagination, it seemed that the
bungalow would be washed away.
Ing that I could not stop or ar
rest his movements, he passed through
me as though I did not exist. I drew
my sword and lay in wait for him.

In order to thoroughly understand
the necessities for and the Importance
of this system some facts must be
borne in mind. If telegraph stations
were located at all points along our
coast there would be no need for wig
wagging. As it happens, though, there
are miles and miles of coast that are
miles a -..ay from a telegraph wire: and
in so*r:o instances there is not a house

it would be an fa.sy matter for a hos
tile fleet to land an army on our shore
Without anybody being the wiser until
after ihe damage was done.
It is to overcome thlÂ« difficulty that
Uncle Sam has established his signal
corps.
Of course the wig-wagging can only
be done between two stations that can
be seer, from one another. But it fre
quently happens th.it two stations are
established which are invisible to one
another, and 'connected" by a third
station that is visible from both. The

A good illustration of this was per

California. It was desired to inform a
certain official in Stockton of what was
going on in a little cove just south of
Bolinas Bay. Of course the cove could
not bo seen from Stockton. But certain
other points could, and this is how the
message was sent. A certain point that
commanded a view of the cove in one '
direction and of Mount Tamalpats in j
the other was selected. From the top i

be plainly ppen, and from the top of j

Among the Jewish rites for the dead it was cus- '

them with strips of cloth, to comb the hair, wash the
body, anoint it with unguents and wrap it in a sheet.
This sheet does not correspond exactly with what we
call a winding sheet, being a rather narrow piece of

the extremities meeting at the feet, in such a manner
that a double Impression of the figure would be left

BOILIM WJITER WITHOUT FIRE.
It is possible to make a pail of water I
boil without putting it on the fire and
without applying external ' heat to it
in any way. In fact, you can make
a pail of water boil by simply stirring :
it with a wooden paddle. The feat was !
recently performed in the physical labr
oratory of Johns Hopkins University,
In Baltimore, Md., and any one may do |
it with a little trouble and persever
ance. All you have to do is to place
your water in a pail â it may be ice
water if necessary â and stir it with a j
wooden paddle. If you keep at it long :
enough it will certainly boil. Five i
hours of constant and rapid stirring '
are sufficient to perform the feat suc
cessfully. The water will, after a time,
grow warm, and then it will grow hot j

Every movement counts from the first
position, which is the holding rf the
flag upi'ight in front of the operator.
It is either a movement to the right
or left or an up and down movement,
a rapid movement or a slow movement.
The heliograph is simply a mirror
swung so as to be able to catch the
sun's rays at a cert*>ir> angle. By mov
ing the mirror one way or another these
rays are flashed or cut off entirely. Bjf
combining the flashes the letters of the
alphabet are formed. This instrument
is fitted with the finest ki:d of sights,
so that it can be accurately aimed at
the station it is desired to communicate
with. Should the messagt be for a sta
tion still further along it Is sent ahead
before it is all received. Where sta
tions are very far apart lookouts are
constantly peering through telescopes
to catch a flash as "soon as the operators
make it. At long distances the flash
cannot be plainly seen by the naked
eye. When the message _is to go on

Professor Ames of Johns Hopkins an

ena of heat by having one of his stu
dents perform the trick in front of his
class. It is a tiresome job, but it Is
perfectly feasible.
The point which Professor Ames
wishes to illustrate is what is known
as the mechanical equivalent of heat.
It requires just so many foot pounds of
work to develop a given quantity of
heat. By turning- the paddle In the
water at a regular speed it Is possible
to find out just how much work is re
quired to raise the temperature of
water one degree. The best measure

ROUND-UP OF THE WORST BAND OF OUTLAWS
IN THE
SOUTHWEST
day ho met the wife of a Mexican rail
road laborer and together they started
on broncos across the country for Colo
radp. The husband, Felipe Aguilar,
came home the next day and Btarted
â  haste after the elopers. What
took place was never fully known, but
Silva and his new wife reached Las
Vegas, worn out and ragged, after
weeks of horseback travel, and a month
later the news followed after them
.that an American farmer in Southern
Wyoming, near Cheyenne, had found
the decomposed remains of a man, who
resembled Felipe Aguilar beneath a
str.iwstack. The head was nearly cut
off, and there were mortal cuts through
the chest. No one ever doubted that
Ffelipe had come upon Sllva and the
el-oping wife, and that the husband had
been stabbed to death and his body
concealed In the strawstack. But those
were rude days.
By. a lucky rind of a small silver mine
in Southern Colorado Silva had somo
capital. Ho opened a saloon on the old
plaza in Las Vegas, and did a good
business from the first day. His win
ning ways, his big mahogany bar and
his gorgeous gambling rooms upstairs
made this place a center of attraction.
The cattle and sheep herders and silver
miners made money fast in those days,
and his place became the most fre
quented in San Miguel County. There
was always a crowd of cowboys, sheep
herders and wool and cattle buyers at
Silva's, and the old-timers say that
some of the most exciting moments
they have ever known in the Territo
ries were those in Vicente Silva's sa
loon-of an evening, when the Mexicans
from the ranges had become drunk and
ugly. The cattle and wool business
rapidly declined in 18S7 and 1888, and
custom at Silva's b3r fell away fast.
Hard times and an extravagant taste
quickly bred in Silva the old-time taste
for outlawry as an easy means of live
lihood, and, while he laughed and joked
with patrons at his bar, and gave os
tentatiously and generously to charity,
he was secretly and at night organizing
the most thorough band of marauders
yet known in that region. He had been
in Colorado and he saw how cattle and
horses might be driven there through
the unfrequented passes in the Rockies,
and how they might be sold in small
bunches for large prices per head at the
numerous mining camps in Colorado
â without exciting comment and investi
gation. Then, too, his long association
with tho Mexican vaqueros in Northern
New Mexico â especially in San Miguel,
Santa Fe and San Barnalillo counties â
made him familiar with- the men most
suitable for an organization for rob
bery and plunder, and he made few er
rors in his choice of followers.
The meeting place of the new band
was the Silva saloon, at night, after
the lights had bec-n put out and the
business closed. No band of Molly Ma
gulres were ever bound by such secrecy
and oaths as were the men who joined
thr Silva gang. Robbery of cattiÂ»,
horses and sheep from the numerous
lonely ranches in Northern Now Mex
ico, with occasional burglary, and a
â murder if it brrame necessary In the
course of operations, was the purpose
of the band. Silva bought for a mere
song a ranch thirty-two miles from
Las Vegas (near San Pedro), among
the Raton Mountains, as the base of
operations for his secret band of rob
bers. A more isolated and uninviting
spot could hardly have been found in
all that region. Scarcely a dozen poo
ple went that way in the course of a
year. The route there twisted among
towering cliffs and pinnacles of gran
ite. Patricio Macs and Manuel Ma
lonado were appointed to look. after the
ranch, and to tell possible inquirers
for the German student-convict goes
to prison on the flrpt suitable day after
conviction and sentence. If Thursday
is not convenient he tells the officer
sent to hale him to jail that he will
come on Friday or Saturday or Sun
day, as the case may be. The officer
never doubts his word, and it is never
broken.
The prison is up three flights of stairs
and is approached by a passage as
richly decorated with the art work of
convicts as the ceD Itself. That apart
ment is not roomy, but bigger than an
ordinary prison cell. It has an iron
grated window, a sma.ll stove, two
wooden chairs, tw> old oak tables and
a narrow wooden bedstead. The fur
niture Is profusely ornamented with
carving, the work of languishing cap
tives, who have placed on record their
names, armorial bearings, their crimes
and the dates of their imprisonment,
together with quaint warnings and de
nunciations. Walls and ceilings are
covered with portraits and legends ex

that it was Silva's property.
It was smooth sailing for the band
for several years. Silva laughed and
played the agreeable host at his sa
loon and gave money to the church and
for the orphans' Home and poor old
people about town. But almost every
day he had reports from the members
of his band, and once a week or fort
night there was a secret meeting at
night among the dark, heavy old adobe
buildings in Las Vegas. Periodically
there was a division of the proceeds
from recent sales of cattle, mules and
sheep from Silva's mountain ranch to
the buyers for the Eastern stockyards.
The ranchmen were continually com
plaining of thefts of cattle and horses
from their herds. The several Sheriffs
and their deputies scoured the coun
try over for the thieves, and the ranch
men banded themselves together to
protect their property. Still the thefts
went on.
In July. ISM. over seventy cattle
were reported Btolen, and three small
postoffices were robbed. There were
mysterious disappearances, also, of
miners and cowboys, who carried
money about their persons, and had no
interested relatives in the Territory.
For instance, Pedro Vejar was seen go
ing to Las Vegas one evening in May,
1890, after he had sold his wool for
$200. He was never seen alive again.
Then there was Antonio Vasquez, who
drew two months' pay from the Santa
Fe Railroad Company one afternoon,
and was seen last at Silva's saloon a
few hours later, partially drunk. His
cousin and sister searched diligently
for him, but not a clew could ever be
had to his fate. Ramon Oberro dis
appeared in the winter of 1891-92 along
with $300 from his sale of mules. The
Indians were given a good deal of
(T , dlt for the crimes, but no evidence
could ever be found against any of
them.
The people were shocked when the
news came in the summer of 1891 that
the ranch home of George E. Payson
(in San Barnalillo County), a young
man just out from Cairo, 111., had been
fmjnd broken into and the remains lay
badly decomposed on the floor, where
the young man had fallen in a desper
ate encounter with unknown murderers.
The house had been robbed of the
money Payson was believed to have
had there, besides its valuables. A
bunch of cattle had been killed and
skinned on the ranch. There was never
even the faintest clew to the mur
derers and robbers, except that several
skins bearing Payson's brand were
found a year later after Silva had been
killed, among several hundred skins
secreted at the Silva ranch near San
Pedro.
"There Is no doubt that the earth
under Silva's old saloon over there
across the plaza holds a number of
bodies of men who have mysteriously
"disappeared from this locality," said a
merchant at Las Vegas recently to the
writer as he talked of the crimes that
the arrested members of the Silva gang
had confessed in court and the findings
of the detectives. "But the men who
disappeared were persons without
friends and relatives here and no one
wants to pull up the floor and dig. Be
sides, what good would it do now, any
way? Seven people quite well known
in San Miguel County dropped out of
sight from 18K8 to 1892. The Sheriffs of
Santa Fe and San Miguel counties had
a constant ilow of reports of robberies
of cattle and horses and burglaries of
ranch houses and isolated stores, and
they and their deputies were ceaseless
ly vigilant. There was not a clew to be

as they could. Silva himself joined an
organization and contributed money
toward detecting the robbers and for
finding what had become of the men
who had so strangely disappeared."
The gang grew bolder and the secret
of the frequent crimes came suddenly
at last. Refugio Esquibel, the wealth
iest ranchman in San Miguel County,
found four of his best bred horses
missing from the range. With his
ranchmen he went hunting over the
mountains for the animals. He came
upon them in the little rock corral at
Siiva's lonely ranch and forthwith he
went and notified the Sheriff that at
last a clew had been had to the thieves
who had so long been robbing the
ranches for miles around. Patricio
Macs, who was at the corral, was ar
rested and fearful of lynching he se
cretly offered to tell all about the rob
bers. He was accordingly let go for a
week, in which time he was to get more
accurate information for the police of
ficers. That was in October. 1892.
A secret report was made to Silva at
his saloon that Macs was about to tell
all. An order that the gang only knew
went forth for a business meeting at
midnight at the saloon. It was believed
another dividend was pending, and
every one of the band was there. Then
the gang assembled, coming one at a
time, and being admitted by a sign at
the rear door. Silva presided. Macs
sat there, unmindful of the purpose of
the meeting. A member rose and
charged Macs with perfidy to the gang,
and told what he knew about Macs'
agreement to reveal the gang to the
officers. A brief trial was held. Ma.es
denied and other members of the band
told what they knew about Macs' per
fidy. Silva called for a vote on the
guilt or innocence of the accused.
Every one voted "guilty." Death had
been agreed upon as the punishment
for perfidy when the gang had been or
ganized. Silva had prepared for the
decision of guilty, and he had a rope
and noose hidden behind his saloon.
In the partial darkness Macs was
bound and gagged by his companions.
He begged and wept that his life be
HOW THE PEOPLE ARE PAYING THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE WAR FUND
IT costs money to sink fleets, cork up
harbors and provide places for sons
of their fathers. If the average citi
zen has been too busy enthusing to
think of this he will be rudely awak-
ened soon. He is going to be taxed
to a finish. The stamp act will be in
vogue again, and life will be subject to
an internal revenue grind.
The war taxes on tobacco, snuff, cigar
ettes and beer are now in effect. The re
sult is most noticeable In the case of
beer. Saloon-keepers are massing their
strength for a death blow at the growler.
The old tin palladium that has been
rushed so often is being rushed off the
earth. The can and the saloon-keeper
are old-time enemies, and It appears that
spared. He began to shout, but he was
choked by the noose about his throat.
Half dead with fear the wretch was
quietly dragged along the narrow
streets of Las Vegas an hour before
dawn to the bridge over Gallinas Creek.
There amid a blinding snowstorm he
was hanged from a stringer. When
October 22, 1592, dawned the body of
Patrick* Macs, stiff, cold and covered
with snow, swayed to and fro in the
wind that was blowing over Raton
Mountains. The Coroner's jury decided
that he had been lynched for an un
known crime.
Events moved swiftly with the Silva
gang after that. Silva knew that he
was suspected. He fled on October 26
to a secret hiding place in the moun
tains near Los Alamos. He was in
dicted for horse and cattle stealing on
November 7, 1892, and became a refu
gee from justice. The Governor of the
Territory and the Sheriffs in Northern
New Mexico together offered $1000 for
his capture.
Suspecting that his wife and her
youthful brother, Gabriel Sandoval,
were giving information to the Sheriff
and the secret organization of citizens
that were slowly uncovering the crimes
of his band, Silva determined to get
rid of his family. So he set about plan
ning how to expeditiously and with no
suspicion of guilt on himself kill his
wife and her younger brother. The
plans were finished by January 23, 1893,
and on the evening of that day Silva
and Guadalupe Caballero rode stealth
ily into LasVegas. Two policemen in the
town, Julian Trugelio and Jose Chavez
Chavez, who had been partially in
league with the robbers and murderers
from the first, were sought out. They
agreed to go with Silva to his own
adobe home and stand guard at the
door while Silva and Caballero went in
side to deliberately stab Mrs. Silva and
her brother to death. Jose Chavez
Chavez was sent ahead to spy out the
situation at the Silva home before Silva
and Caballero went there. Chavez
came back and reported that Mrs.
Silva had company, and that he had
reconsidered and would not be a party
the drink dealer is using the war tax as
an excuse to fire a broadside into his
tin-clad opponent. Whereas the tax on
beer has been increased only $X a barrel,
the price of beer in the can has been
doubled.
It takes a dime to buy what a nickel
would pay for a few days ago. The sa
loon-keeper isn't getting the worst of it
on the deal. He pays, at the outside. $7
for a barrel of beer. Each barrel con
tains 480 glasses, which he sells at 5
cents each. He thus sells his barrel for
$24, making a clear profit of $17 a barrel.
Can sales may reduce these profits some
what, but the tax cannot possibly reduce
the saloonists' comfortable margin more
than $1.

to killing a woman who had been
friendly to him.
The deed must be done that night.
anyhow, so the plan of procedure was
quickly altered. Young Gabriel San
doval was to be lured frcm his sister's
home and then quietly slain. When that
was over Silva was to go home to his
wife, as if he had just come in se
cretly and hurriedly from his refuge in
the mountains, and force her to flee
with him back to the mountains,
where her murder might be accom
plished more at leisure and with no
witnesses to the crime.
That plan suited Policeman Jose
Chavez, who, as an officer of the law,
did not wish quite such a wholesale
murder as was first proposed. Trug
elio was sent to tell young Sandoval
that he was wanted at the home of a
sick friend in another part of Las
Vegas. The young man responded to
the call. Just as he was hurriedly
passing along a narrow dark street,
lined with one-story adobe houses,
Silva leaped from a dark retreat and
stabbed him. Sandoval uttered a
shriek and Jose Chavez, fearing the
noise would rouse the neighbors, struck
the youth upon the head with a re
volver until the skull was fractured.
All the party fled but Silva and Ca
ballero, who carried the body to a
cesspool near by. It was dug out two
years later, when the details of the
crime were confessed.
After washing his hands at Police
man Chavez's house, after the mur
der of Sandoval, Vicente Silva has
tened to his wife. He protested his
love and devotion to her. and told how
he had risked his very life to come to
see her again. He soon induced her
to leave at once with him for his hid
ing: place among the mountains. No
one knows what occurred on that ride
along the lonely trail from Las Vegas
to the Raton Mountains that cold Jan
uary night. When Silva returned to
his half dozen marauding followers the
next day he said he had finished the
job, and there would be no more
The seductive little paper rolls can no

I jumped out of my berth and having turned in "all
standing I was ready to rush up on deck.
â¢Rain was falling in torrents, the darkness was so
dense it could be almost felt and was rendered blacker
by the occasional flashes of lightning. The wind was
howling and whistling through the rigging and the white
waves, la"shed into fury by the sudden storm, were hurling
their crests on the deck, and the sailors were trying in
vain 'to clew up the fluttering fragments of the torn sails
before their violent flapping should carry away a mast.
â  i Even then with death staring them in the face, not one
of them flinched from doing his duty or hesitated to obey
â  his officer's orders. It was a time when prompt action

necessary to haul thÂ« ship to the wind as soon as possible.

only for a minute.
Crash! A violent shock was heard and felt all over the
ship.
Crash! rang out the thunder, followed immediately by
a blinding flash that revealed to us the foretopmast
hanging over the lee-rail.
It was the work of a few minutes to cut away the
backstays and release the wreckage which drifted away
to leeward. When this wan done some of the stoutest

At last day broke, and with its appearance the fury of

us partially wrecked to the mercy of the conflicting cur
rents that hold high carnival around the shores of
Lornbok. -â¢â¢;

the captain that we were drifting fast toward the shore.
Soundings were taken but showed no bottom at 100
fathoms, bo it was useless to think of anchoring. Yet we
could plainly see that we were rapidly approaching those
almost perpendicular cliffs. We were not more than half
a mile off and were nearlng the edge of the seething over
falls caused by the meeting of several approaching cur
rents. Â« .

standing near the boats ready to leave the ill-fated bark
as soon as they were certain they could be of no more
use to the ship. It would all be settled in a few
. seconds â now a biscuit could be thrown on shore. The
main yard arm grazes the cliffs. Crash! Crash' Crash!
The Excelsior's stern was hurled against the rocks, which
at that place disappeared under water perpendicularly for
more than a hundred fathoms, .Â»â¢ .
The force of the collision caused the timber to splinter
like matchboard. \ i ;%.s*glHigÃÃjSF t pi â¢ : â 
Would the. vessel sink? Was she damaged under wa

cause the mast to go by the board? As any one of these
disasters would inevitably have destroyed the boats and
robbed us of our last means of " escape,- the captain or
dered the men into the gig and lifeboat and told them to
row off a little distance and stand by. Barely had they
left the vessel when one of the currents swung: her off .
the rocks and she was free from another danger. When
â  the pumps were sounded the rod was pulled out of the well
almost as dry as when it went in.

The committee went directly into executive L session and
laid all necessary plans to gather the largest crowd of men
ever collected in Pot Luck and march in a body down to
the Gap on the morning of the Fourth, now ten dajs

Less than a week before the Fourth, that the Gapers
might not have time to discover the trap set for .them.
Pot Luck sent this reply to their invitation, an epistle upon
which 'Ceptin' Johnson and the whole committee expended
much time and ingenuity: - -- /t,i,,
"To the Chairman and Members of the Fourth of July
Committee of Dutch Bill's Gap: Gentlemen and Feller
Citizensâ ln acceptin' the invitation so cordially extended
us to participate in the good time you intend havin on tne
Fourth, allow us. on behalf of the citizens of Pot Luck, to
thank the good people of the Gap for a courtesy which is
doubly appreciated on account or our present boom havin
upset our own preparations fer celebratin'. We assure you
that every Pot Lucker who can afford to knock off work
will be down to see you on our Nation's glorious birthday.
(Signed) The Fourth of July Committee of Pot Luck. - __
This reply had the precise effect intended, namely. It
assured the Gapers that the Pot Luckers were as good as
themselves at bluffing, and big Jake Tohmer's fat sides
shook with laughter, when, as their chairman, he read it
'to the committee. Some one suggested that perhaps rot >
Luck had accepted the invitation in good faith.
Jake roared again. "Good faith nothin'! said he.
"They want us to think so and go ahead and prepare for
'em, and then not a Pot Lucker come near our celebration.
That's their game. We wasn't born yesterday; -not.au (or
us. The idee of a boom at Pot Luck! That's too good!
And so things went on, the Gapers making prepara
tions for their usual crowd only, while Pot Luck strained
itself to add men enough to its population to "eat the Gap
out Of house and home." as Ike Bledsoe put it. â  â¢ -
Two days before the Fourth. Jake Tohmer's boys,
Fritz and Jake Jr.. went fishing far up the creek toward
Pot Luck, 'and came home almost, bursting- with excite
111 till t
"Dad." said the breathless Fritz, dashing into hi 3
father's grocery, "the Pot Luckers are goin' to bust our
Fourth wide open!" m , . â , .
"Go long, you young rascal! said his father: what
you tryin' to play on your old dad now? They ain't goin
to celebrate at all up there."
"That's just it. dad, and say! the woods is plumb full
of men up that way; I never saw such droves of 'em. an
me an 1 Jakey heard 'em talkln', an' they're every one of
'em goin' to march down on us Fourth of July mornin an
eat an' drink up everything in sight, run all the Gapers off
the dancln' floor an' off , the groun's, and just < par'lyze us
gen'rally; them's the very words they said, ain't they,
Jakey?"
A' great light suddenly flashed upon the mind of Jake
Sr. Not waiting to hear Fritz's news confirmed ne spread
a big sheet of -wrapping paper on his counter, hastily pen
ciled a call for a meeting that night, not only of the
Fourth of July Committee, but all good citizens of the
Gap, and tacked it up outside his door.
Jake's s grooery store wouldn't begin to hold- the Gapers
who answered the call, and the public pulse ran co high
that it seemed nothing but bloodshed could result. Some
of the more impetuous Gapers were for arming every man
and going to meet the Pot Luckers half way. This was
given up as too hazardous. Pot Luckers were known to
' be fighters to a man. and would doubtless greatly out
number the Gapers. 'Others suggested moving to. a grove
a dozen miles down the river early in the day and thus es
caping the ravaging horde from Pot Luck. But this
smacked of cowardice and could not be considered for a
moment.
The chagrined Gapers blamed their committee for get
ting them into such a dilemma, while accusations of bun
gling and stupidity passed freely between the committee
mombers themselves. Big Jake Tohmer was almost the
only man present who did not lose his temper, and when
the meeting seemed about to break up in a free fight he
banged loudly upon his grocery counter with a sugar scoop
and ps chairman of the meeting commanded order.
What 'Ceptin' Johnson was to Pot Luck, Jake Tohmer
was to the Gap, and the noisy crowd was hushed to silence
when he rose to speak. ,:
"Feller citizens!" said big Jake. "I own I'm as much to
blame in this matter as any one; perhaps more. I don't
believe any of you will call me a coward, and you all
know I ain't at man to set my. Judgment up against the will
of the majority. What goes with the crowd goes with me;
but if you'll allow me to say so, it's lust struck me all of
a heap that we ain't been trcatin' the Pot Luckers Just
right rer some years back. While they've been goin'.back

dlin' away, we've /been progressln' right along; our or
chards and vineyards multiplyln' and yieldln' bigger, and
cur population- growin' year after year. Another thing:
We've got homes and families here at the Gap with our
fair share of women folks to make homes worth havin',
while up there they're only a crowd of mmm' men batchin*
together. And with all our prosperity and happiness, in
stead of Bympatbizin' with 'em and extendln'. a helptn
hand, we've been flghtin 1 'em at every turn and tryin to
take away what little they've got left, just because they,
used to be big enough to crow over ua In years-gone by.
Now about this celebration: We wasn't satisfied to beat
'em bo bad that they didn't have the heart, to .try -to cele
brate at all, knowin' our attractions â wotiid.dra'.w' all the. : .
crowd from the country round about; not' satisfied with- â¢
this as I Bay. we must taunt them by sendin' that sham
Invitation. That, of itself, was a challenge, and -they're,
only takln' It up as they have" a right to. -Now. 11l tell
you, friends, to my notion there's Jus.t one v.ay.fer- us- to
get out of this scrape like men. That. 1b fer. us- to pervlde
the best there la in the land, and enough. of- It fer. every
Pot Luckcr that comes, and treat 'em so- white that -ev>-fy

I don't pertend to dictate what course. .we. ought- to. take,
but If there's any one present with a better -p3an out at
the difficulty I should be pleased to hear from him.'; â¢ â  ' â 
Dead silence prevailed for some moments after Jake.-'
ceased speaking. Then ihe leaven .of brotherly. -lf>ve im
parted by his speech seemed all at once to lea ve-n thfe whole
lump. His plan, put in the form of a motion,. .was carried

The Jews of every country, every na
tionality and every clime arc- ranged
upon one si > of the presert conflict,
but not on the ,â :<'.â¢â â¢ of Spain.- Their
hearts, their swords, their wealth, their
sympathies and prayers are with the
Un ted States. The flower of Judah has
enlisted among the lirsit volunteers un
der the Stars and Stripes.
From San Francisco aior.e 109 stal
wart Jewish youths went to the front
with the First Regiment, a number far
in excess of their proportion to the
general population. A similar quota
may be found in he other arms of the
service. The daughters of Esrael are
among the most feager workers under
the Red Cross, le<: by their ra.bbis. The
aged orthodox Israelites, those "f the
Old School, who hail f- m Russia, Rou
mania and Eastern and Southeastern
Europe, are too old and feeble to take
up arms, but they offer up their con
tributions, whatever little they can
â pare, U-r the comfort of those who
have gone to the front, and their
prayers morning and evening for the
success of our arms and our victory
over Spain. They still have faith in
the . I prayer and believe that
theso United States have been chosen
by the Lord as his especial instrument
to avenge the wrongs of his chosen peo
ple v >on Spain. : .
When Spain found that the United
States would no longer tolerate her in
human acts at our very door, and the
Yankees might fight, her fin;
agents approached the Rothschilds and
Bassoons, the money kings, to negotiate
terms for a loan. The financiers
not be induced to float a loan foi
upon any term?. -No. security Spain of
fered would they a< <â¢. pt, neither her
mines, lands nor future revenues suf
ficed as pledges. The monarchs of
finance simply shrugged their shoul
ders, but remained obdurate, while
Spanish securities went lower and low
er on 'change.
Quite a different scene was enacted
this side of the Atlantic. When Presi
dent McKinley saw that war was in
evitable his trusted friend, Senator
lianna. went to New York to see the
Seligmans, the great financiers. The
Seligmans had lots of money for Uncle
Bam, which he could have as long as
he wanted it, upon his own terms; no
security required, except his evidence
of indebtedness. And, in case their re
sources should become exhausted, to
provide for possible contingencies, the
Seligmans cabled to their banking
bouses In London, Paris, Frankfort and
other money centers, and the reply
from each source was that all the
money the United States should need
would be furnished on call at an inter
est to be named by the Government.
Thus the United States was enabled to
equip an army, buy battle-ships, move
Its troops, procure everything needed
or desired, and send millions with every
expedition, knowing that as many more
millions were in reserve, while Spain
could not raise enough money to repair
her old ships and make them at least
Beaworthy.
Th^Â» Jewish youth of NÂ»w York form
ed one reg'ment and fully equipped it;
Chicago furnished another regiment of
bright, intelligent, patriotic young
Jews, most of whom abandoned lucra
tive business or positions to take up
arms for the country. Six hundred
young Russians from New Jersey, who
had seen service under the Czar of Rus
sia formed a cavalry regiment, and
were mustered in. The National Coun
cil of Jewish women held meetings In
1 Philadelphia and Baltimore and effect
j ed an organization to give practical aid
to the Government.
The American Patriotic League of
Russian Jews organized in Cincinnati
on May 15, elected Rev. Dr. Isaac Wise,
the jrrea* Jewish savant, its president,
Issued an appeal to all Israelites, urg
ing them to organize in every city and
community, raise funds, equip sol
diers, buy a battle-ship, present it to
the Government, and aid the Govern
ment in every way in its present strug
gle for human rights and human lib
erty.
"We have left the country of our
birth," the appeal says, "because we
hate tyranny, have come to this coun
try because we love liberty. Let us give
lasting testimony to this country how
her adopted children value the privilege
of living under the protection of the
stars and stripes."
The best' example of the intense
i hatred against Spain harbored by the
1 old and orthodox Jew can be daily seen
in the city of New York, in front of the
offices of the four Jewish newspapers,
where crowds of these people congre
gate, eagerly scanning the bulletins

and giving expression to their feelings
of joy over any ad\*antage reported in
favor of this country by their violent
gesticulations, shaking of their bodies
and the curses they utter against Spain,
the "accursed," as they designate it.
The intensity of that feeling can be un
derstood om.. by those who have
learned through tradition and had im
planted in their youthful hearts a re
cital of the atrocities inflicted upon
their kin by the cruel, inhuman Span
iard.
After the destruction of the second
temple, the fall of the Jewish empire,
the children of Israel became dismem
bered, lost their nationality and went
forth homeless wanderers among the
savage tribes of Asia Minor, the north
coast of Africa and wherever they
found a foothold or temporary abiding
place. Their natural trend was toward
Spain, where many thousands of their
brethren had settled many years be
fore the destruction of the temple,
founded colonies and prospered in all
their pursuits. Many thousands of the
nomads, in course of time, reached the
shores of Spain, where they found rest
from their years of wandering. They
brought some civilization with them,
had laws and maintained order. A
thrifty, industrial, peace-loving people,
they prospered and gained in influence
until they controlled the principal in
dustries of the land inhabited by an in
dolent race. The sanitary and marriage
laws which the Jews held sacred as
God-given, divine institutions, were
conducive of making theirs a healthy,
sturdy race. In the knowledge of ag
ricultural pursuits they w\?re in ad
vance of the Spanish primitive peasant,
whom they naturally outstripped.
To fully appreciate the intense hatred
of Jews against Spain, which has been
nursed and has surviv d centuries, it
is necessary to know the history of the
Jews in Spain, as it has been handed
down through books and tradition from
one generation to the other among the
children of Israel The chapter opens
in a halo of glory, made more radiant
by the sunshine of peace and pros
perity, but closes with the recital of
perfidy, tyranny, wholesale murder, pil
lage and rapine at the hands of in
furiated mobs.
The fancied security of the Jews in
Spain was of short duration. Just as
they had reached the very zenith of
influence and prosperity the storm of
spoliation and persecution, whioh had
devastated the Jewish quarters of
France and Germany, broke over Spain,
the stronghold of Jews of all Europe.
That persecution changed the history
of the Jews and turned the fortunes
of Spain. Until that period Spain had
been mistress of the world, on land
and sea. The Mediterranean was to
her as an inland" lake, her fleet cover
ing and traversing it from end to end.
All other countries were more or less
dependent upon Spain in their foreign
trade relations. While thus intoxi
cated by her own glory and power,
slowly but surely she encompassed her
own downfall. It was near the close
of the fourteenth century that fanat
icism, bigotry, hatred and religious
frenzy got the better of toleration and
judgment.
It arose in Seville. The new mon
arch, Henry 111, a feeble boy of 11,
treated the matter with indifference,
until it became too late to stem the
wild current. On March 15, 1391. Mar
tinez deliberately incited the mob to
riot and violence against the Jews. The
passion of the multitude had become
Inflamed and broke out in a wild up
roar. The Jewish quarter was pillaged
and many of its inhabitants met in
stant death. The Governor, unable to
restrain the m b, sent messengers to
the King for assistance. \Y hen the mil
itary arrived the knights, nobles and
the better classes of Christians took
sides with the Jews in an effort to sup
press mob violence. By their com
bined efforts they succeeded in quelling
the riots, but not until many Jews had
been killed and much property looted
or destroyed.
Three months later, June 6, 1391, the
rabble again attacked and set fire to
the Jewish quarter, resuming its "holy"
massacre with increased fury. Of a
community of 7000 families, estimated
at about 30,000 souls, 4000 were killed
outright, women and children were sold
into Mohammeian slavery and the rest
permitted themselves to be baptized to
escape death or a worse fate. The syn
agogues were converted into churches,
and the once wealthy and important
Jewish community of Seville was a
thing of the past.
The horrible scenes enacted at Seville
were the beginning of the period of
carnage which spread to all cities of
Spain and over the entire peninsula,
growing in fury as it progressed, until
every Jew had been either murdered,
baptized or banished, and Spain was at
the mercy of the lawless, bloodthirsty
mob. The craving for plunder and the
worst animal passions drew to the
rioters' ranks the very worst elements
from all classes, who masqueraded un
der religious fervor, while the persecu
tion swept like a raging torrent over
Spain, leaving death and devastation
in its path. Riot and rebellion were
rampant throughout the kingdom.
Armed mobs patrolled the streets, defy
ing the authorities. Men took to arms
for the lust of spoils, murder and ra
pine. They lost all human feelings
and turned to vultures.
The rioters, steadily augmented In
number, and crazed from excesses, at
tacked Cordova, the parent community
of the peninsula, murdering all Jews
who refused baptism. Toledo, the cap
ital, contained the largest community.
Here the mob rose on June 20, a Jewish
fast day, and slaughtered the steadfast
adherents to the ancient faith. At the
approach of the merciless mob, when
escape seemed impossible, many of the
most prominent Jews put to death
mothers, wives, daughters and sisters
to save them from the worse fate of
falling into the hands of the inhuman
rioters, and killed themselves. Seventy
communities were made the victims of
that terrible violence, which traveled
like the black scourge. At Ascalona
not a single Jew remained alive. Three
weeks after the outbreak at Toledo the
inhabitants of Valencia ros? agafcist
the Jews. Of the 5000 Jews in that city
not one remained. About 250 were mur
dered at the first attack, some fled
and all the rest embraced Christianity.
Throughout the kingdom the Jews were
attacked with fire and sword.
On August 5, the massacre of the
Jews began in Barcelona, the proudest
home of Jewish intelligence and wealth.
The great fortunes which the Jews of
that place had acquired by their ex
tensive maritime commerce excited the
envy of the rabble. In the first on
slaught nearly 2500 victims fell. A
large portion of the Jewish .commun
ity found shelter in the citadel, where
they were defended by the Governor
of the town and the nobility. The rab
ble attacked the stronghold in superior
numbers and' set fire to the building.
The Jews saw that there was no chance
for escape and that their presence en
dangered the lives of their protectors.
The braver ones went forth to meet
their persecutors In the open and they
fell in honorable combat. The remain
der either put an end to their misera
ble existence, or were put to death, as
soon as the rabble laid hands upon
them. Eleven thousand Jews were
baptized in Barcelona on that occa
sion; few escaped, but not one Jew re
mained in Barcelona. In Catalonia
and in Aragon the wealthy Jews were
spared, having secured protection in
exchange for their fortunes.
The closing scene in this dreadful
drama, marking a dark page in the his
tory of civilization, came in 1492, when
the sovereigns of Spain issued an edict
expelling all Jews from CasUie. Ara
gon, Sicily and Sardinia, and that if
one were found within the proscribed
territory after four months from that
day he should be put to death without
trial. They were not allowed to take
with them any gold, silver, money, or
forbidden articles of export, which
was equal to sending them forth desti
tute and penniless from the land in
which their forefathers had dwelt for
fifteen centuries, toward whose great
ness, wealth and culture they had so
largely contributed.
An immense sum wc.s offered the
crown to recall the cruel edict, and the
King was about to yield, when Tor
quemada again interfered, threatened
and cajoled, until he carried his point,
against the earnest advice of the
King's councilors. The Jews could not
realize on their lands, houses, goods
and chattels. They could not take any
with them, owing to the restrictions,
nor could they obtain any bills of ex
change, as all the commerce was in the
hands of Marranos, who would not
risk being seen peaking to a Jew or
having any business with him.
A palatial residence was bartered
away for an ass and a magnificent
country seat was exchanged for a bolt
of cloth or linen. Torquemada forbade
all Christians to have intercourse with
the Jews under penalty of excommun
ication. The Jews made ready to go,
knowing that to linger meant certain
death. Over 300.000 Jews, who had re
fused baptism, left Spain one day to
become homeless wanderers of the
globe, not knowing whither they were
going, nor *Lat fate awaited them,
carrying with them memories of grief
and misery, torture and persecution.
Professor Graetz, the eminent histor
ian, writes of the expulsion of the Jews
from Spain and its consequence in the
following words: "The expulsion of the
Jews from the Pyrenean Peninsula, un
wise as it was inhuman, forms in.vari
ous ways a well marked turning point

may say, the most' striking of bathing

man who is bright and clever should not

bathing suits.
Truth is. the artistic eye never cares for

more desirable, especially, in bathing suits.
â  Jus; now'; the "summer girl has a great
Hieing for' those fashions that suggest the

have more sailor blouses this season than
we have seen for many moons. The more
nautical your bathing suit the more fash
ionable will you be.
AH skirts end just above the knees this
year and if you are wise you will not
let your patriotic feeling keep you from
wearing the French skirt, which consists
of a narrow front width, two narrow side
widths and the back in two pieces with
a bias seam.
If you choose you may call It by some
other name, because it is really Ameri
can made, but I assure you that you caw
find nothing prettier or more serviceable
for a bathing skirt.
Striped bathing suits will be stylish this
summer, whether in silk or flannel; ana
these are inexpensive, while braided or
naments are being utilized for the mosv
expensive suits. Sometimes the braid iÂ»
used on piain silk, but the latest suits
are of unusually elaborate materials.
Embroidered effects are more in favor
than ever and they are of the most ex
pensive and intricate kind.
Certainly the gown without a yoke is aj<
exception, and revers are almost If not
quite a.s popular. They are cut in every
conceivable shape. Most small revers
fold back on eitner side of the yoke ovei
the Shoulder. The most popular suit com
;he yoke, blouse and revers.
*i a, the bathing suits are more at
tra< tlve than ever. They are designed in
blue and white and embroidered in ari
ei,ors ;n.,l swords ami other things whicn
suggest campaigns on land and sea. JuÂ«i
now nothing is more appropriate than a
aea blue .suit with white cropped swords
embroidered over the skirt and collar. It

there is the indestructible black siik. It
is quite expensive, but with a narrow
stiffening of haircloth which has been
shrunken around the edge antl a light per
caline or silk lining one has a suit which
wnl be worth more than its weight in
'â  one "I' its greatest virtues is its
.js. .Much lias been said about the
unnygicnic qualities of heavy bathing
suits, and experiments show that a light
suit is the stcret of healthful results
from bathing.
The new costumes, some black, some
navy and not a few red, proclaim them
â¢ eminently suited to the graceful
ai.u slei.ci. ;â  woman.
I shouid like you to see a charming
haml-embroldered flannel suit, *ligh-tly
:te, with short puffs over the shoul
der-,. The collar extends over the sleeves
in two points. It is slightly bloused, with
a pleat down the front laced in white
conl. The collar is finished in plain blue
flannel. Another made In black uncrush
able siik shows the possibilities of smart
ness in a high-necked yoke of pale blue.
Thft entire skirt is prettily trimmed in
black silk braid. The lapels of this cult
an- covered with braided decoration, so
that the original material is only slightly
visible. From Fashion's standpoint this is
a very desirable suit.
Briliiantlne and alpaca are used more
tian any other materials for the best
Â£ -turr.es. Silk is used not only for the
t. minings, but for entire suits, and the
i i -time favorites, serge anil flannel, are
> ill in evidence. A tailor finish is given
/ the higher-priced, garments shown In
'â  shops, and relltting makes them quite
satisfactory as if they were made to
â¢ -r.
$ silk alpaca is a decided novelty, not
fy in material, but design. Of royal
:.â¢ !t i.s pretty trimmed with white silk
â  rpentlne braid. The braid is applied on
"he skirt in pointed design. The bolero
4h<ws several rows, which are again seen
on the sleeves and belt. The bolero is
eery jaunty and curves away from a full
vest, which falls Into a slight blouse.
This style Is particularly becoming to
Blender figures. Another blue is also of
bright shade, but the material is brillian
tine trimmed with bands of white, feath
er-stitched with blue silk floss. The skirt
is short and full and is made separate,
being fastened on a white feather
stitched belt. The full sailor blouse and
bloomers are together. The blouse has a
large white sailor collar, feather-stitched
in blue, which opens into a low V-shape
In the front. This can be filled in with an
adjustable plastron, which matches the
collur in color and decoration. The
sleeves are short and puffed.
Poth of the styles are duplicated In
white. One trimmed with bands of pale
blue is especially pretty. Red enters in
to the combination of another white suit,
and the brilliant touch of color is charm
ing. Still another white suit has a touch
of black to relieve it. Quite as pretty as
any of the others, even if it is not so
pay. is the costume of all white, made of
white brilliantlne. The material has a
creamy tint and is trimmed with a braid
of silk cord. Dark blue or black silk
stockings are in better taste than the
white ones originally intended for this
costume.
A striking bathing suit is of red and
black alpaca. The red is barred on in

"He who beholds her hand, forgets hei
face."
A WHITE shapely hand is a great
attraction, and, more than any
other member perhaps, pro
claims gentility and rellnoment.
Many a woman, plain and unprepossess
ing of feature has held the destiny of
men in her soft, pretty hands.
In all ages courtiers and lovers hays
bent the knee and bowed the head to kiss
tho hands of ladies fair, for there is n-Â»
greater mark of homage and respect than
this kiss upon the hand.
In olden times there was a common su
perstition, and it Is shured by ma-ny m
thn present day and generation, that the
character and destiny of the individual
can be read In the lines of the hand by
those who are familiar with their signifi
cation.
The hand Is also one of the greatest
vehicles of expression, for the whole ga
mut of human emotion can be expressed
through its agency.
Qtfintilian says, "Other parts of the
body assist the speaker, but these speaic
themselves. By them we ask, we prom
ise, we invoke, we dismiss, we threaten,
we entreat, we deprecate, we express
fear, joy, grief, our doubts, our assent,
our penitence; we show moderation, pro
fusion; we mark number and time."
With patience the hand may be educated
to almost any art or grace. So whatever
time and consideration we give to this
most useful axid Important member will
not be wasted.
First of all, learn to control your hands.
Overcome the restless and unmeaning
habit of fingering chains and ornaments,
of twisting the fingers, and of playinj,
with a handkerchief, when talking.
Cultivute repose.
All hands are not equally symmetrical,
and very few pc-rsons are born with ex
quisitely graceful and refined hands.
Much can be done, however, to enhance
and preserve their comelilness.and the la-
seen in a band on the skirt. A black
serge is made elaborate by numberless
rows of fine white braid. In a suit of
white serge the colors are reversed though
the style is duplicated.
A crimson brilliantlne is quite up to the
fashionable standard of bright colors.
White silk braid relieves the red and
makes a pretty combination. Maroon
serge is another relief to the all-pervad
ing blues. Black or white braid in nar
row lines is used for the trimming.
Many of the blue bathing suits have
the national colors blended into harmo
nious trimmings. Sometlmer, the colors
are the braids, and again silk floss em
broiders in the guy tones. These cos
tumes enable the summer girl to carry
her patriotism to the seashore.
The silk costumes are very Frenchy.
The skirts are short and full and the
bloomers rather scant. They are fitted in
to be worn with a corset. Wonderfully
chic, they will be prettier for the beach
promenade than for actual contact with
the breakers. The brilliantlnes and fine
alpacas are not only pretty, but stand
the test of the salt water a-lmirably. Be
ing a trifle wiry, they do not cling to the
figure so closely as the silk garments do,
and, again, they shed the water.
The American women are better dressed
on the beach than the; women of other
nationalities. They combine a touch of
the chlcness of their French sisters with
their own more conservative Ideas.
By Mme. Hygeia.
dot Is well worth every woman s while.
First in Importance is a good soap, and
a pure white castile Is about the best.
Wash the hands in soft, tepiu soapsuds.
Be sure and wipe them thoroughly and,
at least once a day after washing gen
tly locsen and push back the skin at the
base of the nail, which, if not attended
to daily, will attach itself to the nail and
grow up with it. After some time it will
crack and become sore, leaving the nail
weak and unsightly.
Frequent cutting of the skin at the root
of the nail will make it tough and hard.
When through neglect this skin has
grown up on the nail so aH to entirely
cover the "half moon," secure if possible
the services of an experienced manicure.
After the nails have been once thor
oughly doctored It is quite an easy mat
ter for each woman to become a physi
cian to her own nails and to prevent this
skin from adhering again to the growing
nail.
Do not cut the nail, but file it from side
to side, rounding it to exactly the shape
of tho tip of the finger and not letting
it extend beyond thr- tip further than is
necessary as an actual protection to the
tiriKer itself.
If you desire the nails to present a deli
cate pink surface, like the inner polish of
an exquisitely tinted seashell, see that
the articles of your manicure set contain
a box of pink nail powder and another of
nail cosmetic. Apply a little of this lat
ter to the nail and rub vigorously with
your chamois polisher, which has been
dipped in the pink nail powder. Wash
this off carefully and polish again, with
another polisher, and the result will be
what you desire.
Wash the hands always in soft water,
If possible. A very nice powder with
which to soften the water when too
hard, and which is also whitening in its
effects, can be made by mixing together
three ounces of fine ground oatmeal, three
ounces of fine almond meal and half an
ounce of borax. Put a tablespoonful in
the basin of water before using.
For hands that are rough and red this
cream will be found delightful: Cocor\
butter, oil of sweet almonds and -refined
white waxâ equal parts,
out even so much as one little speck of
IRVING DEFIED STAGE SUPERSTITION.
OF all superstitious folks the men
and women of the stage take
more cognizance of omens, good
or bad, than any other class. The
latest and most talked of in-
stance of ill luck following an
actor touches the eminent Irving, first
of the sock and buskin to be knighted in
two centuries.
After occupying a seemingly Impregna
ble position at the head or" the London
dramatic world for a score of years he is
now said to be succumbing to his ambi
tious rivals. His last season has been a
succession of magnificent failures. On
the heels of this comes word that Miss
Ellen Terry, whose name has been in
separably connected with Irving's suc
cesses, is about to go over to the enemy.
Still, other influences are said to be at
work to dim the future of the man who
has done more than any other living
actor, perhaps, to lift the drama to the
high position It holds among the arts.
The enemy in this case seems to be
Beerbohrn Tree. For years he has been
the adroit manager of the London Hay
market and later of Her Majesty's Thea
ter. He is an actor who is a master of
the art of make up and character im
personation, although he has never
equaled Sir Henry in the genii 1 j of the
atrical production.
Now here enters the Irving bogeyman.
Irving was christened John Broadrib. On
the stage he nas ever been known as
Henry Irving. A few years ago he de
ciued to have his name legally changed
to .Henry Irving. Soon the attendance
at the London Lyceum, which had been
the most brilliant in the EngHsh capi
tal, dwindled to a scattered few. Then
stage folks said: "Well, he ought to
have known that he'd hoodoo himself *f
he changed his name."
But Irving defied the superstition. Then
in recognition of his genius Queen Vic
toria accorded him the high honor of
knighthood, and made him Sir Henry Ir
ving. During the two years that have
elapsed since then a series of misfortunes,
not great when reckoned' separately, but
formidable in the aggregate, have bi-failen
him. He alienated the corps of Englisn
critics, whose praise had been- his stand
by. The press became apathetic. An ac
cident which he suffered during the re
hearsals of "Peter the Great" necessitated
the postponement of that production for
weeks.
One after the other "Cymbeline," "Mme.
Sana Gene" and "Peter the Great" all but
failed before London audiences. The hoo
doo was beginning to lay its fell spell, but
more was to come. A "disastrous fire to
tally ruined the elaborate scenery and
properties of the few' repertoire plays
which had been successful. Meanwhile
Beerbohm Tree's production of "Julius
Caesar" at Her Majesty's Theater became
the reigning sensation In London. Then
came the secession of names for the sake
of euphony when they went on the stage,
but that is quite different from changing
it :>fterward. Thus Maurice Kline deemed.
"Barrymore" more euphonious and adopt
ed it.
Clara Morrison dropped the two last
letters of her name when she went on
the Stage. Jennie Griffiths became Jennie
Yeamans. Joseph Arthur, who wrote
"Blue Jeans," was christened Arthur F.
Smith. Kate Cone became Kate Clax
ton. Laura Joyce Boil was a Miss Mas
kell. Mme. Janauachek js otherwise Mrs.
Fred Pillot. Mary Alice Hogan became
Alice Atherton. Mr. Kendal's name was
originally W. H. Grimstone, and Mrs.
Kendal was known as Madge Robertson.
Louis Alurich was Louis Moses. Marie
Jansen was Mary Johnstone. Marion Ma
nola was a Miss Stevens before she be
came Jack Mason's wife.. Sadie Marti
not's patronymic is Egins. Minnie Mad
dern was a Miss Davy. Pauline Hall
dropped her family name of Schmittgall.
Clara Poole became Mme. Polink' Lily
Langtry and Lillian Leonard-Solomon
Perugini et al. have had divers applica
tions.
Perhaps the most widely known and
deeply respected superstitions are those
about the bad luck consequent upon rais
ing an umbrella in the theater, and on
the stage actors and stage managt.-rs in
variably thwart the author's purpose It
there is any such "business" in a play.
Peacock feathers are a fierce and dead
ly hoodoo. Indeed, the fire in the Firth
avenue Theater a few years ago was di
rectly attributed to the use of peacock
feather fans in Fanny Davenport's pro
duction of "Cleopatra."
Light blue scenery, costumes, uphol
dirt to mar their immaculat&nes*, or tbÂ«
hand, however white and beautiful, will
lose all its charm.
Keep the nails scrupulously clean', with-
stery, etc., used to be tabooed, and if the
first person who enters a new theater is
a deadhead the place is under a spell at
once. If a leading man wcounters a
cross-eyed Individual at the stage door
he has hard work- to square himself with
his fellows who heap of it. For genera
tions it has been forbidden to hum or
whistle Locke's Incidental music to
Macbeth" behind the scenes at any time
IN" actor is permitted to bring a yellow
trunk into a theater. Yellow cats bring
hard luck. Black cats are hospitably re
ceived in "front of the ' house." When
Harry Miner opened his last theater a
cat ran out and some one scared it fur
ther away. Hatless and coatless Miner
dashed out of the lobby and pursued the
cat till he caught her. Then he stormed
at the ignoramus who would drive a
black cat out o/f a new playhouse.
It is. "bad luck" to say the "tag" at a
rehearsal; to pass a blind beggar and not
throw him a coin; to* fall to touch a
hunchback when within range; to sleep
in room 13 at any hotel; to sleep 'head to
the engine' on sleeping cars; and dozens
of other more or less trivial things. â 
The worst, however, is to change one's
name, as Irving did.

ELECTRIC FANS IN Cr|UÃCrl-
We observe that the members of a
church in Baltimore have determined to
put in electric fans. This is an innova
tion which will be shocking to many very
devout people, but It seeing to us that it
is a most sensible thing to do. People in
olden times had an idea that any sort of
an old barn with all sorts of discomforts
wo/rtd do for a place of worship. Indeed,
there were tnose who contended that the
building Itself ought to be as little at
trnctive as possible, because men and
womvn should go to church for spiritual
edification only, and that that was to be
obtained regardless of surroundings; that
it was a confession of weakness of the
spirit to say that physical appurtenances
were necessary to religious edification.
But men have become more sensible In
this age. The body and the mind and the
spirit are so closely woven together, and
the body itself is so strong and assertive
that it has been found that complacency
of the physical man is quite necessary to
complacency of mind, and spirit Reli
gion is- largely sentimental, and that
â which appeals to the esthetic nature
helps along the religious feeling. There
can be no doubt of the fact that attrac
tive surroundings and comforts do help
one to enjoy religious exercises. It is im
possible for one to be filled with the
warmth of spirit when his physical self
is -shivering in a cold churcl\ and it is
equally Impossible for one to awake his
soul to all righteousness when in an at
mosphere of drowsiness.
"We are but dust, and our piety needs
all the help possible. It seems to us that
electric fans are as sensible in summer
as a furnace in winter. â Richmond

TAFfY- FOR 'OUR WHIST EDITOR.
â  The Nashville Banner says: "Our cousins
over the border have paid American whist
players a frre.it compliment by deferring the
annual congress of the Canadian Whist League
until the- month of July, in the hope that
Americans may feel disposed to favorably con
sider an Invitation that haÂ« Juet been sent by
W. A. Hunter, secretary of the Canadian
â WTiiat League, to all members of the American I
flowing energies to the pursuit of more I
prey or the satisfaction of some, pressing
want. Insi â  energies manifest
themselves In the way of Imitation or >
tion of all those efforts and exer
which are essential to the mainten
of life. Now. this imitation, or repe- ;
titlon. Is what we call play.
Professor Groos acknowledges that this
conception of play is a plausible one. :
But he believes that its inadequacy can
easily be demonstrated.
He denies that play should be univer- i
sally considered as tie imitation of seri
ous activities, for which there may be In
clinations but no opportunity. He admits
that imitation is of the greatest import- '
ance in much play. Nevertheless, he j
holds that the conception of imitation j
here set forthâ namely, as the repetition j
nous activities to which the in
dividual has himself become accustomed I
âcannot i c applied directly to the prim
ary phenomena of playâ that is, to its
Brsi elementary manifestations, to the
play of young animals n:id of children, i
For such plays, which must be explained
at the very outset in order to get a sat
tory conception of the subject, are
very often not imitations, but rathei
premonitions of thu serious occupations
of the indivi lual.
This, then, is the professor's view. Ho
holds that play is an instinct developed
by nai ection, which works for
anything that is serviceable for the pres
ervation of the species. A condition of
superabundant nervous force is undoubt
edly a favorable one fur play, but it ia
not its motive cause, nor a necessary
condition of its existence.
The instincts operative in play, like so
many phenomena of heredity, "first ap
;â â  ar when the animal really needs them
that Is. In youth. Without these instincts
the adult animal would be but poorly
equipped for the tasks of his life. He
would have far less than the requisite
: i f practice in running and leaping,
in springing on his prey, in seizing and
strangling th< victim, in fleeing from his
enemies, in fight ng his opponent, eta
The muscular system would not be suffi
ciently developed and trained for all thesis

ducements and frankly admits that the com

and the games will be played in the beautiful
and well appointed rooms of the Toronto Ath

at an early date, and that a band of crack

OUR WHIST EDITOR OFF FOR THE
EIGHTH CONGRESS.
On the 6 o'clock overland train last evening,
In a through car to Chicago, our whist editor
settled himself down for a long, hot ride over
the alkali plains and through the page brush
country, to attend the eighth congress of the
American Whist League, to be held at Boston
beginning Monday, July 11, and ending Satur
day, July 16.
It has always been the aim of The C.ill to
I â¢â  up to date on all whist matters, and for
that reason our whist editor will be on the
ground when the battle opens.
Vhat is forced finesse.
Judge George L. Eunn of St. Paul, Minn.,
who without doubt Is one of the greatest
whist players living, tells us what is called the
forced finesse Is, strictly speaking, not a
finesse, for no chances are takenâ play
cannot lose; a common example Is this: North
leads a small spade from queen, ten and two
others; South plays king and wins the trick;
he returns a small one. West plays small, and
North plays the ten, not the queen, for the ace
must be with East; If East has the' Jack also,
! the play of the ten will do no harm: but If West
has jack. North's ten forces the ace, and he
is left with the best card of the suit. Even
when third hand cannot cover the card played
by second hand without playing the second best
card of the suit, the forced finesse must be
made; for example: North leads fourth best
from queen, nine and three small; South wins
with king and returns the eight, which West
covers with the ten; North knows that South
' has neither jack nor ace; that Bast has acÂ»
and that jack Is with West or with East- North
must not cover with queen, for ace may nÂ»
alone In East's hand, in which case It must
fall and North's suit is established, while if he
played queen, the jack, if with West would
have been made good. The forced finesse play
er must, however, watch the fall of the cards
and be careful that he does not allow himself
to be underplayed; for example, suppose South
played the ten on North's lead of a low card
, from queen, nine and three . small, and that
West won with king; South gets In and returns
, the eight; In this case the jack Is placed. In
Easts hand: the ace may be thrre falso but
there is â  chance that West is holding it up-
North therefore plays queen, for If he does not
Jack will surely win the trick; this situation
j arises most frequently in trumps, where sec
ond hand will rarely play the best on the sec
ond round if he has a smaller one. Situations
Similar to the are constantly arising In many
different forms, and the best rule | a to note
I reason of the cards and use common sense and

! tatlon during the life of each Individual,
even in the period of growth. It is thÂ«
iron hand of natural selection that brings
I into bold relief without too compelling in
: slstence and apparently â without serious
motive â namely, by means of playâ what
will later be so necessary. There neect
â  not be any particular superfluity of ener
; gy; so long as only a small remnant oi
unemployed force is present the animal
: will follow the law that heredity haÂ»
i stamped upon him.
Instinct, therefore, Is the real founda
i tion of play.
"Foundation, T say, because all play Is
I not purely Instinctive activity. On the
contrary, the higher -we ascend in the scale
of existence the richer and finer become
th.Â« psychological phenomena that supple
| ment the mere natural impulse, ennobling
it. elevating it and tending to conceal it
i under added detail."
Play not only enables the young animal
to exercise itself beforehand in the stren
uous and necessary functions of Its life,
co as to be ready for their onset, but It
enables the animal by a general instinct ,
to do many things in a playful way, and
so to learn for iteelf much that would
otherwise have to be inherited In the form
special Instincts. When the Inherited j
instinct is thus supplemented by individual
experience It need not be so carefully
elaborated by selection, which according
ly favors the evolution of individual in
telligence as a substitute for blind in
stinct. At the moment when the intelli
gence roaches a point *f development
where it Is more useful than the most per
fect instinct natural selection will favor
individuals in whom instinct appears only
in an imperfect form, manifesting itself
In early youth in activity purely for ex
ercise and practice â that is to say. in ani
mals which play. Indeed, the conclusion
seetne admissible, in summing up the hlo
loglcal significance of play, that perhaps
the very existence of youth Is due in part
to the necessity for play. The animal does
not play because hf Is young; he has a
period of youth because he must play.
His third and fourth chapters Professor
Groos devotes to anecdotic illustrations.

with a wealth of detail, an opulence of

THE BOOK OF THE WEEK.
The Play of Animals.
Mark Baldwin says in the illuminating
preface which he supplies to his daugh
ter* translation, it should be a matter or
congratulation to all workers in biology
and in psychology that the first book on
this subject is at the same time one of
such unusual value, both as science and
as theory.
The term "experimentation" is used to
denote such movements of young ani
mals as enable them first to win the mas
tery over their own organs and then over
external objects. It includes stretching
and straining the limbs; tasting, seizing
and clawing; gnawing and scratching, ex
ercising the voice and making other
Bounds; rending, pulling, tearing, tugging,
kicking, lifting and dropping objects, etc.
Such experimental movements are of
fundamental importance for all the life
tasks of animals, for on them depend the j
proper control of the body, muscular co- i
ordination, etc, and, physically, they pro- |
mote the development of the perceptive'
faculties, such as space perception, at- |
t< ntion, will power, memory, etc. They
form the common foundation on which
the specialized plays are built up.
"With the stretching of his limbs," say
the Bfullers, "the young dog begins the j
first stage of his baby play." Puppies :
also i egin very early to gnaw any wood
en object, as well as their own extremi
ties, with their little sharp teeth. Even
the play with their tails is largely experi- ]
mental. Afterward the chase instinct
comes in, when the end seems to vanish
as mysteriously us they whirl. A kit
ten, too, will play with its tail and exer
cise the claw armed paws in seizing and
holding. Scheitlin observed a young pan
ther playing with its own tall, and Brehm
relates how pumas, at the age of from
five to six weeks, play with Ihelr moth
er's tail, as do all the cat tribe. Little
nestlings make fluttering efforts before
they can fly, and young sparrows chirp
so lustily in the nest as to suggest genu
ine voice practice.
The case of animals is much like our
own. The impulse to experiment con
tinues into advanced age, and constant
ly tends to rise above its instinctive
origin to freer, more individual ac vity,
so that the fully developed animal prob
ably also feels something of the pleasure
in exercising power, in being a cause.
By the term movement plays Professor
Groos designates sports that involve
change of place for its own sake. Hunt-
Ing and fighting. Indeed, .also produce
change of place to a considerable extent,
but with them the movement has a spe
cific aim. Here I refer only to such plays
as are concerned with practice In locomo
tion as such, where the walking, running,
leaping, climbing, flying, swimming of the
animal finds its object In itself.
Birds can no more fly of themselves
than babies c:m walk. The Infant's kick
ing corresponds to the fluttering of little
birds in the nest and h!s first .step to their
first attempt at flight.
The parents of sparrows shy of flight
urge them on by holding food before them
and flying on with the dainty morsel, ut
tering encouraging calls.
Among aquatic birds, also, the parents
assist instinct in teaching the young how
to swim, and so hasten their preparation
for life's tasks. Old swimming birds tak<?
their young on their backs and then Bllde
them off into the waterâ a very simple
method by which many a boy has been
taught to swim.
Such movements can, of course, be con
sidered as play only so long a.s they are
simply exercise. As soon as the bird is
far enough on to turn his flying or swim
ming to account in the search for food
play changes to serious activity. This
transition takes place very quickly in
birds, but their sh<<rt time for practice Is
just as really a playtime as is the longer
period of beasts of prey.

and Decatur In 1812, and as a captain he
was with Farragut at Mobile Bay. His
recollections amount to a history of our
naval service in war and peace. Long as
signments on foreign stations have made
his life full of incident, and his recollec
tions of notable men, places and events,
both at home and abroad, are numerous
and varied. The volume was prepared
without referring to notes or journals,
and this has imparted an informally con
versational tone to the pages of the book.
There Is a strong flavor of Marryatt in
the opening chapters, which tell of the
author's rollicking midshipman days off
the coasts of South America and Califor
nia. From the primitive naval academy
of those times he went to Washington in
1848 and engaged in coast survey work
until ordered to the Mediterranean squad
ron. His reminiscences of society in the
American capital fifty years ago are fol
lowed by recollections of foreign service,
naturally interesting, because a naval of
ficer's duties, social and official, necessar
ily bring him in contact with a great
variety of prominent and interesting char
acters. Returning to America in time to.
distinguish himself in the Civil War, Ad
miral Franklin saw the navy change from
wood to iron, from sail to steam, and he
was on the Roanoko in Hampton Roads
when the little Monitor saved the Union
fleet from destruction by the Merrimac.
In charge of the dispatch-boat Dacotah
he witnessed and took part in many
stirring scenes, and many chapters are de
voted to his anecdotes of historical per
sons and events of the war. His promo
tion to the rank of rear admiral In 1885
was a fitting culmination to his long and
honorable service of the country.

their work with pride.
The warm weather came and the fam
ilies moved in, each occupying half of the
premises. It was a fine arrangementâ
for a time. Mrs. Lyke and Mrs. Maypole
borrowed sugar and raisins of each other
and the husbands traded cigars, which
they smoked on the veranda in the warm
evenings. The cottage was the first to
be built on that side of the lake, and they
had no neighbors to encroach on their

Cuba," by Italo Emlllo Canlnl, is the title
of a new book that ought to prove of per

we find this: " 'History.' said a great
writer, 'is a mixture of good and of evil,
with here and there a glorious page.'
But he who would undertake the study of
the methods which Spain adopted in con
quering Cuba, and in retaining its pos
session for 400 years, with the expecta
tion of finding such a page, would com- |
mit a grave error, for he will meet with i
the story of no deed on which he may I

The book contains some forty illustra- I

being portraits of famous Cubans, pict

and Sabbath calm, while the Maypoles
liked dancing and games and all joined
voices in singing the popular songs of the
day, did not mar the happiness of the
flock. The relations were cordial and the
exchange of cigars and raisins and laun
dry soap continued.
In time, however, the likes and dislikes
of the families began to jar. Sometimes
Mr. Lyke and his family would be tired
and retire early, only to have their nerves
jump in tune to "There'll Be a Hot Time
in the Old Town To-Night" or "My Gal is
a High-Bo'n Lady." And in time, too,
there came gentle suggestions that early
hours and much quiet were beet for city
dwellers who were seeking rest and
health in the country. On the other hand j
there were as covert suggestions that i
there was no need for persons to be j
mummies simply because they were in >
the rural districts.
The rag-time melodies continued to
make the shore of Fox Lake echo, and â 
the Lykes continued to retire early and !
court elusive Morpheus or seek thY sub- i
stance of Fox's martyrs at a distunce of j
fifteen feet from a rousing chorus, ac
companied by a piano that was working |
overtime.
The thread broke at last and the atmos- ;
phere about the Maypole-Lyke cottage j
became such that the icehouse tvent into â¢
disuse. If either side wished to have ice- \
cream or sherbert for Sunday dinner it
simply set the mixed ingredients on the
front porch and in five minutes the stuff
was ready for the table.
Last season Mr. Maypole nnd his fam
ily left the cottage for the sole use of the
Lykes. They spent the hot months else
where. The Alderman thought long over
the proposition, and as a srxewd business
man, came to the conclusion that it was
poor policy to have vacant property nn
his hands. Under this train of thought a
result was soon reached and the next day
a local carpentering firm sent a force of
men to Fox Lake with a full kit of tools.
The carpenters waited- until the gray
dawn appeared, and t!ien they mounted
upon the roof of the mutual cottage.
They began to saw. Hip. rip, went the
blades, and they did not stop until they
had made halves of the structure from
roof peak to basement. Then they began
on the barn. That was divided, and the
icehouse and chicked coop suffered a like

ter of the building did the carpenters di

The opening article of McClure's Maga

official life of President McKlnley from
the first dawn of the war crisis down al
most to the present moment. Only four
of our Presidents have had to conduct a
war, and how President McKinley con
ducts one is here related with a most in
teresting wealth of detail. The Illustra
tions of the article consist of typical war
time scenes in the White House and de
partments, drawn from life, and a num
ber of excellent portraits from recent
special photographs.
Stephen Bonsai, who was himself a
participant in it, tells .the story of "The
First Fight on Cuban Soil" in our war
with Spain, and his article is interestingly
illustrated from photographs taken by
himself. Cleveland Moffett's account of
"The Fastest Vessel Afloatâ the Tur

and unique experience as well as the de

The Century for this month Is fully up
to its usual high standard. Of course it
is apropos of the principal events in the
public mind. Stephen Bonsai, late of the
American legation at Madrid, has written
an article for the July Century on "Holy
Week in Seville." The paper is illus
trated with sketches by Joseph Pennell.
Poultney Bigelow contributes to the July
number of the Century a paper entitled
"Ten Years of Kaiser Wilhelm." Mr.
Bigelow is a personal friend of the mon

ten years ago that the Emperor has a
"Yankee head on his shoulders." The ar

by Emperor William of "The Ironclad

role he finds full scope in which to dis
play his wide versatility as an actor of

the author has created for the minor
characters much important business
which calls for capable people to handle
it. Mr. Morrison is given excellent sup
port by Miss Florence Roberts, who has
won a goodly share of the praise during

able and intelligent interpretation of
its historic roles. The handsome pro

' "ii lik â  'ion to the tTnited
B, I was told that they regard-.
c.l it as the most p> tical solution, of'
their difficulties They are not and '
have not been content with Spanish
rule for some years, but ajs the island is
small, all revolts have been promptly â¢â 
put down by Sp;<in. The Cuban rebel
i lion has been f Mowed with the. utmost
j Interest at Pr rto Rico, ns its success
has been looked on as a possible means â '.â¢
of accomplishing the independence- of
the smaller island, either as. a republic â¢
or a part of the Cuban republic. â  ' .-.â¢' â 'â¢
Public opinion, however, since the,
commencement of the war, has. leaned. V
to the hope that the island will fall into..:
hands of *he Americans, as not only â¢
would it have the protection 'of a tried .
and stable government, but American â 
capital would develop the marvelous '
resources of the country. '. 'â¢' â  â¢ '. â  '
With this end in view the President '.
of the Porto Rican Junta, which,- -lUte
that of Cuba, has its headquarters in v
New York, has had several interviews
with President McKinley, . and ' has
probably given the American Govern^,,
ment some valuable information. : â¢ â¢."'"":
Autonomy in Porto Rico does, .'no.t'."
seem to have brought the blessings that:,
were predicted for it. The Porto Ric.ans '*:
are good business men, energetic arid i
progressive in their various industries;
but as they have never had any experU .
ence in self-governing they are. inclined ,'â¢
to ask of autonomy what a British-sub
ject did when the king knighted, him. .
"What shall I do with it?" .The only '
benefit they seem to derive from' lt is.
that, instead of being robbed, by offi
cials sent from Spain and having the .
money thus obtained taken out of" the:
country, they are plundered by officiate
of their own choice, and the- money re
mains at home.
The interpretation of autonomy by.
some of the lawer classes is extremely.'
amusing. They consider that law and
order is at an end and that they are at
liberty to do practically as they like.
The vigilance of the police has had to
be increased in consequence. The peo
ple are not, on the whole, anxious for
self-government, and if justice â a thing
unknown in Spanish courts â reduction
of taxation and import duties can be
assured them, they would willingly
leave the government to others.
The island is self-supporting, not in
: debt, and last year a surplus of $1,000,-
I 000 was taken out of the treasury by
; Spain and added to the Cuban war
fund. The exports of the five chief
products of the island for one year are
as follows: Coffee. $14,500,000; tobacco,
$5,000,000; sugar. $4,000,000; molasses,
$500,000â total, $24,000,000.
Besides these a large business Is car
! rled on with the neighboring islands in
; cattle and hides. All these products are
i capable of being greatly increased.
Eatables, lumber and machinery are
imported from the United States, hard
; ware mostly from England, and textiles
from England and Spain, owing to
I strong protection.
As there are heavy duties on Porto
Rlcan goods entering Spain, the United
States are found to be a better market
for the island's products, while Spain
protects its own goods in Porto Rico
with a duty that, on some articles,
reaches 90 per cent.
Porto Rico was settled by Juan Ponce
de Leon, whose connection with Florida
is well known, and who founded Ponce,
the town being named after him. The
island is about 100 miles long and forty
miles wide. The population is nearly
1,000,000, 25 per cent of which is black.
The capital is San Juan, which was re
cently bombarded, situated on a small
island, and connected with the larger
one by a bridge. The only fortifications
are at San Juan and consist of two
forts â Morro and San Cristobal â which
are 200 years old. The battery consists
of about sixteen breech-loading 1 guns of
Spanish make, and the Spaniards
boast that they make the finest guns
in the world. Recent events have
proved the contrary and my informant
seemed to think that some exceptions
might be taken to the sweeping asser
tion among the European nations as
well. The garrison at Porto Rico num
bers about 7000 men, who are armed
with Mauser rifles and are stationed
along the coast.
The highroads are kept in excellent
condition and compare most favorably
with the English roads, which to the
American cyclist seem little short of
Paradise. There are also several lines
of railroads between the most impor
tant towns, but they are more remark
able for the eccentricity of their time
tables than anything else.
San Juan is a town of about 35,000 In
habitants and is well cared for by the
authorities. The paving of the streets
is particularly excellent, being superior
to that of either London or Paris. The
people of the island are strong and
healthy, the climate being far better
than that of Cuba. Yellow fever is not
very prevalent and could probably be
almost suppressed if more attention
were given to the sanitary conditions.

THE LUMBER TRADE.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron gives the fol
lowing review and statistics of. the Lumber
trade at this port:
"And still the lumber trade continues dull
and buyers are scarce. I Several mills In Men
docino County are shut down entirely and oth
ers are running on part time, and with the
present prospects others will soon stop. Hum
boldt Is very dull. The receipts of Puget
Sound lumber are quite large, but the lum
ber goes Into the yards and sales are slow.
When the change will come no one dare pre
dict. -;..->. â â¢;â 
"The present conditions of the lumber market
in the Eastern, Northern and Middle Western
States is â on the other balance from that of
the Pacific Coast. The war has had a some
what depressing â¢ influence, but. as was the
situation last year, the conditions are Im
proving-. Demands are increasing and the
amount of lumber necessary to satisfy them
will be enormous. The Southwest is the first
section of the country to be affected, but the
movement promises to be general and steady."
The exports of lumber from San Francisco
by sea for the month of May were as follows:

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. July 2.â The Financier says:
An .xpansion of $12,536,800 in deposits, neces
sitating an extra reserve requirement of $3,
131.700, against which the gain in cash was
only $2,939,000, accounts for a decrease of
$192,700 In the -surplus reserve of the New York
Clearing-house banks for the week ending 1 July
2. The unusual expansion In deposits is due
mainly to the fact that the Government funds
received from bond subscriptions are being
placed in special depository banks. Thus the
National City and Hanover National, two of
the i>rincipal institutions holding this money,
reported to them a gain of over $5,000,000 In
deposits or 75 per cent of the total increase for
the week. The gain in loans, however, runs
well throughout the entire list of banks, and
is one of the most favorable developments of
the week. In the last ninety days the loan
expansion has been $2f.,000,000 and the total is
now about the same amount under the ex
traordinary' high point attained February 19.
Deposits, however, surpass all previous rec
ords by $12,000,000, and In view of the special
operations of the treasury, will probably at
tain within the next month a total far above
anything yet recorded. The current stateraent
is confusing, and does not balance, but the
operations which are bringing about the
changes are well defined, and will continue to
rhnw for some wteks to come. The Important
point Is that th" surplus seems to have at
tained Its higher average. As heavy as the
treasury expenses are, In view of the war,
they will hardly equal the receipts on bond
subscription account, and while a large part
of the extra money will go into specially des
ignated banks, the operation will tie up more
or lesn money. In the meantime there is no
cessation of the demand for funds on the part
of mercantile and crop borrowers here and
elsewhere, and these requirements will have
to be met. After July 14 the allotments of the
large bid"? will call into use a great deal of
money now lying idle. All these circum
stances will have a tendency to keep money
employed, and while no one looks for any
thing approaching a stringency, money will
not be a drug on the market, despite the fact
that the country' possesses something like $176,
000,000 of specie and other currency which it
did not have at this time last year.

A GREAT SLED
RACE IN ALASKA
XERGTrriC Andy
White was seated in
a cozy room, looking
out on a long street
hat extended from Main strr-ot away
p hill to the foot of Silver Bow Basin,
ack of Jur.eau, Alaska. The sidewalk
ml roadway were covered with snow,
.h: h was packed hard, and was very
lippery. Hoys with sledfl of all sizes
nd shapes were engaged in coasting on
he walk and roadway and every now
GIRL WHO IS ALMOST 'FRAID.
I'VE told my Dolly Dimple that to-morrow's Fourf July.
She says she'll try he good and brave and hardly ever cry.
But brother's got some orful things; he says they'll shake the house.
P'raps when they bani? I'll go and hide as sly as any mouse!
But when the firecrackers are gone and cannons all are still,
I'll bring my Dolly Dimple out, and she shall have her fill
Just watching brother's famous py-ro-teck-ni-cal display!
And then you'll hear us both. We'll shout Hip, hip! Hip, hip! Hooray!
and then boys would come sliding by
the window and repass on their way
up hill, ready to begin the trip all over.
Their re red, their mittens cov
ered with snow, and their boots and
Bhoea glistening.
"I don't believe I am going to like
Juneau," said Andy to his cousin, Tom
Anderson', who sat by the fireplace op
posite him. "Why, I don't believe there
is a single level spot in the whole
town."
â 'Well, if there is it is very small," an
swered Tom. â¢ "But then we boys man
age to have fun enough, though it is
not like the town I lived in while In
California. There we could play base
ball and football to our hearts' con
tent, which we don't attempt here. But
we do have real fun coasting winters.
Most ail the fellows own sleds, and we
often race with one another. There is
one boy here â an Indian â who has
:i every boy he -raced with but
Paul Kendel. Kendel is the son of that
man -who struck it rich last summer.
He owns the nicest sled here, and has
offered to give five dollars to any boy
who can beat him coasting. Indian
Charlie, the mission school boy, has of
fered to race with him to-day. I urn
sure lie will win, although nearly ail
the boys think differently."
"His sled is the best, then," said
Anday.
"There is where you are mistaken,"
returned Tom. "He has n~> sled, at
least not what you and I vvjuid call
one."
"Why, do you think I am silly enough
to believe that?" laughed Andy. "Or
perhaps the chap uses snowshoes?"
"Wait till the race comes off and see,"
Bald Tom mysteriously. "These Indian
chaps are queer fellows. You can never
tell what they are going to do."
After dinner Tom and Andy walked
down to the foot of the street to see the
contest, where a large crowd of boys
and men were gathered.
"Hello, Anderson!" shouted some of
the boys when they saw Tom. "Where
did you get that new boy you are tow
ing around?"
â¢Soon Tom was busy introducing
â¢Andy to his friends, a very cosmopoli
tan set of boys, who seemed glad when
tIK-y learned that Andy was to live
among them and go to school. He was
introduced to Paul Kendel, who was ]
seated on his much admired sled.
"So you are Anderson's cousin?" he II
said, surveying Andy's new suit. "Came !
up on the last boat, did you? Guess i
you can feel the motion yet in your

legs. Most newcomers do for a while."
Andy admitted he did.
"There isn't a boy in this town who
has won so many races as I have," con
tinued Kendel arrogantly, "and I will
beat that Indian, too. I wouldn't race
with the Stwash if it wasn't he hi;s
beaten every other white boy here. Tfn
to one he will back out, when the time
comes. He ought to be here now. It's
2 o'clock."
"Here he comes " shouted Romo
youngsters seated on a log pile "but he
hasn't got his sled."
"There," said Kendel, "I knew just
how it would be. He is afraid and will
have some excuse to offer. You can't
depend on that crowd from the mission.
If you take my advice you will not
play with them, Andy."
The Indian boy. who was about 13
y ars old â Kendel's own age â came
running up to the srroup of buys.
"So you have backed out," laughed
Kendel. "I thought you would."
"Me no back out. I all ready," said
the Indian.
"Then Where's your old sled?"
"Here," said the Indian, as he reach
ed Hi' under the back of bis coat and
Withdraw a thin. Kmooth board the Blze
of a large shake, with one broad cleat
on top n^ar the lower end to brace his
feet against in coming down hill. The
UM.I.-r side was covered with smooth
strips of whalebone fastened length
"There," said To~ laughing as Andy
waa examining it, "what do you think
of that for a sled?"
"It is queer looking. I have never
seen one like it. I fear you will not
win," he said kindly to the Indian boy
who only smiled broadly.
"Well, well, boys." said th<* umpire, a
fat man with a red beard, who, though
60 years old. always claimed he was as
much of a boy as ever. "Now just
scamper up that hill as quickly as pos
sible with this man, who will* s*"" you
start fair."
At once Kendel and Indian Charlie
began the climb, followed by such of
the boys as did not wish to lose any of
the sport. Tom and Andy remained at
the foot of the hill, and stood by the
mark the winner would pass over.
When the crowd reached the top of the
hill Indian Charlie, Kendel and the
starter walked out to the center of the
road and in a few seconds the signal
for them to start was given, and away
they sped, going faster and faster very
second on tho down trip, fairly flying
by the buildings. It was seen as they
came nearer that Kendel had thÂ«- ad
vantage by at least three feet, and as
he lay on his sled it swayed from side
to side as he bent forward and back
ward with excitement. Indies Charlie
sat on his queer sled as if part of it,
and came over the little rough places
and hummurks as if sliding on ice.
"Hurrah for Kendel! Go it! You'll
win!' was heard shouted on all sides.
Hut just as the boyg neared the mark
in the snow Indian Charlie came swift
ly over a rise, and passed over the line
with wonderful speed, ending ahead
of Kendel by the length of his queer
sled, amid thÂ« cheering and shouts of
thf onlookers. He was pronounced the
fair winner by all but Kendel.
"For," he said, "his sled was not like
mine, and he wouldn't have beaten if it
had not been for that rise and the down
grade below it. You bet, next time I
race it will be with a fellow who has a
sled likd mine."

A SEAGULL TAMED,
BY CHARLIE GETCHLLL.
I HAVE often watched and have
often fed the Beaguils while cross
ing San Francisco Hay on the
ferryboat Piedmont Finally my
little sister Flora, who is an in
valid, beard bo much about the kulls
that she Bald si - would like to se<
Poor little Flora! Qi able to get out of
doors :;s she is I made up my mind that
Bhe Bhould have a seagull for a pet
How should 1 catch it? Willie Nichols
told â  lay we hired a l-nt In
Oakland ("reek and pulled nut to the
head of the sea wall. There we baited
some hooks with apple and waited for
the narrow-gauge boat, the Bay City,
to come along.
Pretty soon we heard the wheels of
the steamer and saw her coming toward
us. There were seagulls flying over the
boat. We paddled up as near to the
Bay City's course as we dared to and
threw our lines overboard. The lines
were not leaded and so the bait floated
on top of the water, some distance from
us. One of the seagulls saw the prize (?)
and darted down to it. The next mo
ment we had the bird In our boat and
we put it in a covered basket just as
soon as we could. The other seagulls
looked as if they were astonished at
the whole performance and flew rapidly
away, screaming or talking perhaps,
about the happening.
Flo was the happiest girl in Alameda
County that night. We had a wire cage
in which we used to keep a parrot and
into that the gull went. Flo was
greatly delighted to see that it would
take food from her hands the next day.
In a week she let it out of the cage.
Now it flies all around in the nursery
and makes no sign that it wants to get
away. It is regularly fed and has a
nest in the cage. It moves its head so
seriously and looks so comical that Flo
often laughs as she looks it it. So you
ccc that a seagull can be tamed.

hOW UNCLE BEN
MADE HIS ESCAPE
VENING found us
around the fire in
Uncle Ben's cabin
among the Sierras.
coaxing Ben to tell
us all about his Fourth of July escape
from the Mandan Indians. The pipes
were lighted, the fire was crackling
merrily in the fireplace and the wind
among the pine trees was piping a
fierce but merry tune. The cabin
shook in the gusts, but it was securely
anchored. We were all anxious for
Uncle Ben to begin his story, which.
he soon did, although he truly protested
that he would much prefer to listen to
"the youngstt-rs," as he called the
young hunters of the party. We would
not take "no" from Uncle Ben, and ha
saw that to be the fact.
"It waa this way," said Uncle Ben.
"The Mandans had lost a horse. I
came into their camp riding that very
:i. i could not make them believe
that 1 had found the horse off In the
mountains. They said the horse never
would have wandered off. They were
very angry and determined that they
would put me to death after the fashion
of some savagesâ that is, they meant
to burn me at a stake.
"That was not pleasant, but there
â would have been no gain in crying
about the matter. In fact that would
have made the braves call me an old
squaw. 1 did not sleep very well the
night after 1 came to camp. 1 knew
enough of the Indian dialect to under
stand what the rascals were saying as
they sai around their camptire. Two
of them, White Bird and Thunderbolt,
quarreled about who should have my
revolver and my other fixings after
they had burned me. That was a queer
conversation for me to listen to, but I
let them know that I understood it all,
and shouted at them that they were
two cowards and old women, and that
I was equal to them both.
"How the Indians laughed! The
chief, Nompetuck, was not such a bad
fellow. I heard him tell White Bird
and Thunderbolt that he believed that
I was as strong as I had boasted. Noth
ing would do the two Indiana then ex
cept to have me brought out of the
tepee where I was a prisoner. The In
dians threw a lot uf pine logs on the
fire, which flared up so that the woods
were as light as they are at noon.
Guards were stationed to prevent me
from getting away; then the deerskin
thongs that held my feet and hands
were cut by Nompetuck. The old chief
grunted and said: 'White thief talks
big. Let's see what he can do.'
"I never let any one call me a thief.
Almost before I thought I knocked the
chief down. The braves came to his
rescue and I was punched and kicked
considerably before the chief inter
fered. Then he grinned and said that
I struck him very hard, and that there
'would be heap fun' when White Bird
and Thunderbolt were ready. There is
nothing that Indians like so much as
daring. I believed that they would
surely burn mo unless I could get away
that night. When I was a student in
the University of California I was the
best nifeh jumper there, and a life of
roughing it in the woods had not made
ma any ltss active.
"Like a Hash I made a high jump,
running, and cleared the head of Lhe
chief, who stood in front of me. White
Bird ana Thunderbolt did not under
stand this game. As I touched ground
I had a short limb of a tree in my
hands, and with this I swept a path
clear. It would have amused you to
see ho-v the old chief laughed
" 'How!' said the chief, and he came
forward and shook my hand. 'White
man no coward; only coward who steals
horse. White man all right.'
"Of course the Indians could not say
anything against the chief. He was
my friend many daj's. We hunted to
gether, and I was able to show him
Eome tricks of hunting and fishing that
he did not know. Finally I told him
that I knew where the thief was who
had stolen horses from the tribe, and if
he would send fc.-ur Indians with me
I would capture him. My reward would
be my own freedom. He thought this
over a while and said 'yes.'
"We set off together, I and the four
Indians. I led them into the mountains
until we came to a cliff, the secret of
which was known alone to me. This
was a blind cave, where I had once
wintered. I rolled away a big ?t<me
from the opening and showed them a
dark passageway into the cave. They
made me go ahead, which was just
what I wanted. The passage wound
around big columns of stone that held
THE BOY WHO LIKES A RACKET

the roof up, and when we came to onÂ»
place I gave them the slip. I had the
only torch. That I dropped purposely.
A minute later I was out of the cave
by another rassageway and had the big
Btcne t;'ck in its place, and there wore
the four Indians bottled up and howling
like wolves. A hard hour of work en
abled me to cover the place so with
one thing or another that even an In
dian's eyes would not have found it..
"Boldly playing my game, I went
back to the chief and told him what I
had done. He was furious and wanted
to shoot me then and there, but his
old squaw had a wise head and asked
me what I had done this for.
"My answer was that if they would
give me a horse and six hours" start I
would tell them the secret. Only I
would not do anything unless the chief
would let me take his only son with me
to the Little Muddy River as a proof of
their good faith. They threatened and
even tied me to a stake at last and
heaped up faggots about me and set
fire to them.
They saw that I was determined to
have my way. Then the men and
women grumbled so at the chief that
he kicked the blazing- twiga away be
fore I had been badly scorched But
I was nearly suffocated and the fire
was more than middling hot about me.
"The next day I rode away on the
chief's horse, holding the chief's young
son upon the saddle with a grip of
iron. The Indians dared not shoot
then. When we canu- to the cavt I
commanded that all the Indians who
were following should put down their
guns and knives and hatchets at a cer
tain place. This was really a trap that
I had contrived. I struck the guns with
my heavy boot before they could stop
me. The guns and knives sank out of
sight and rattled down the sides of a
deep mountain hole that I had covered
up.
"Before they recovered from their
surprise I was on horseback and go
ing at a breakneck gait over a fearfully
rough country, taking many chances of
a fall. An hcrur later the Indians were
on my trail, having rescued their com
rades and being angry at the trick I
had played them. 1 lost no time get
ting out of the country and I have
never been there since."

Berkeley a soldier company and Red '
Cross legion, and the children compQs-.

some time to-morrow. The Red Cross
followers are little girls, who have been .
