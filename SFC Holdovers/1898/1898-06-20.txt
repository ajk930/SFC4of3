Troops Will Lose No Time
taring Santiago.
MADRID, June 19.-Private dispatches received
here from New York say General Shafter's expedition
has landed near Santiago de Cuba and will attack the
town immediately.
NEW YORK, June 19.â The
Washington correspondent of the
Herald telegraphs: Secretary
Long believes that under the pro
tection of the guns of Rear Ad
miral Sampson's men-of-war
American troops are being land
ed from transports in the vicin
ity of Buiquiri, preparatory to an
attack on the city of Santiago de
Cuba. Long said this evening
that he was momentarily expect
ing a cable message from Admiral
Sampson announcing the arrival
of the troops and that debarka
tion was in progress. lie said it
was possible the troops might
have reached the vicinity of San
tiago de Cuba at midnight last
night, in which event the <:<
kation would have continued
steadily during the entire day.
It is understood in official cir
cles here that the point of landing
of the troops will be swept clear
of Spaniards by the shell and
shrapnel of the American vessels,
after which the Cubans will take
station at some distance in the in
terior to prevent the Spaniards
from attacking the troops as they
go ashore. In this manner it is
confidently expected that a body
of troops can be debarked which
ONE BIG SHELL
FROM THE OREGON
HIT GUANTANAMO
GUANTANAMO, Cuba. June 18 (via Pert Antonio, Jamaica, June 19). â It is with fury that the Spaniards
learn that they must leave the American ships in undisturbed possession of this harbor and the marines in peace at
Fort McCalla. The lesson has been so umvercifully hammered into them within the last few days that they are
beginning to comprehend that their ambition to drive the marines into the sea is hopeless. The warning was
given to them some days ago. and the shells which were huried yesterday from the Texas, Marblehead and Suw
anee have had a salutary effect, and this morning the Marblehead, St. Paul, Dolphin and Suwanee went at them
again.
Cuban scouts had reported that a number of Spanish soldiers were massed at a point of land lying between
the fleet and the town. The Marblehead and Suwanee steamed in and took a position within easy range of them
and the St. Paul and Dolphin opened from their anchorages. The firing began at 9 o'clock and continued for an
hour, during which the strip of raised land was mowed almost level with the sea.
This was the beginning of the day's work. It was carried on by the Oregon, which came in from the block
ading fleet. When the had finished coaling she went close in shore and sent four 13-inch and six 8-inch shells in
search of a Spanish gunboat which is hiding up the bay. One 1.3-inch shell struck a building in the town and
threw debris a hundred feet in the air. It was a cascade of stone and mortar. Soon afterward the Cuban scout;,
reported that hundreds of Spanish troops in Guantana'.no, aroused by reason of this shot, were massing for an at
tack on Fort McCalla. A company oi fifty bluejackets and one field piece was immediately sent from the colliers
and the Panther to rc-enforcc the marines. The expected attack did not take place.
The San Francisco Call
'will be able to re-enforce the in
; surgents and keep the enemy en
ed, if they should attack, un
til additional troops can be got
; to their assistance.
With the troops disembarked
on Cuban soil there will be no
delay in the prosecution of the
| business which has called them to
S^tiago. Secretary Long said
to me the present would be the
most important week of the war
\ up to this time, and it is evident
' from ibis remark he anticipates
| an attack on Santiago is to follow
the landing of the troops. In
I army circles it is said that at least
I two or perhaps three days will be
necessary to get the troops and
: all necessary traps ashore.
The wharf at Buiquiri will be
useful in permitting transports to
get alongside of it and discharge
their men and guns and artillery
caissons which they have in their
holds.
The point of landing deter
mined upon is connected by road
with Santiago, which will make
easier the task of the engineers
of preparing the way over wffich
the troops are to march in their
offensive operations against the
Spaniards. It is expected that

SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, JUNE 20, 1898.
Admiral Sampson will destroy
the shore defenses with the ut
most dispatch and the batteries
protecting the harbor of Santiago
de Cuba as far as his guns can
reach. When this is done tor-
I pedo boats and converted tor
i pedo boat destroyers will be sent
in the harbor to torpedo if pos
sible the Spanish men-of-war.
Aside from this and the protec
\ tion of troops during the landing
j the navy will not play an impor
tant part in the operations against
I the city.
The siege guns which General
Shafter has with him are to be
mounted on the hills overlooking
the city and harbor, and this fact
would seem to indicate the au
thorities have no intention of
permitting troops to take the oity
by storm. Of 'course, however,
the campaign cannot be directed
from \Vashington,.and if General
Shafter should deem it important
that the troops should attempt to
take the city his judgment would
be regarded as satisfactory by the
Washington officials. What is
wanted, however, is the surrender
of the city, in order that Cervera's
squadron may be taken as
promptly as possible.

and among some of them it is believed
to be a straw indicating the Philippines

is pointed out that Admiral Camara, an

Porto Rican harbors by the Americans,
may have coal aboard in order that his

made a dash upon the American coast,
as threatened by Lieutenant Caranza hi

are still at Carthagena.
Consul Sprague, the representative of
this Government at Gibraltar, cabled the
State Department to-day that he had re
liable information of its continued pres
ence at that port. If bound for the
Philippines more than a month will be
consumed in making the voyage. An
official with whom I talked to-night said
that the President firmly believes that
the interests of this Government will be
better subserved by the dispatch of a

than by attempting to take the city of
Havana with raw troops against the well
trained men which Blanco is able to put
in the field.

ON BOARD THE.HERALD
CALL DISPATCH-BOAT SOM
MERS N. SMITH, OFF SANTI
AGO SATURDAY NIGHT (via
Port Antonio, Jamaica, Sunday,
June 19 â ncM.-n. â By the time this
dispatch reaches you Morro Cas
tle, the principal fortification re
maining at the entrance of the
harbor of Santiago, probably will
be a mass of ruins. The work
of completing the destruction of
Santiago's outer defenses will be
undertaken either by the dyna
mite cruiser Vedtavlus or by the
guns of the warships in the
American fleet.
I As I have explained in previous dis
i patches to the Herald and The Call,
the only thing that has prevented the
destruction of Morro Castle long ago
was the fact that Lieutenant Richmond
Pearson Hobson and other members of
the Merrimac's crew were imprisoned
in that fortillcation, and the Americans
took every precaution to spare them
from danger during the recent bom
bardments. Admiral Sampson has been
convinced from the first that Admiral
Cervera and General Linares had Hob
son and his fellow-heroes placed in
Morro Castle solely to prevent the
Americans from shelling that fort.
This chance opportunity furnished the
last hope the Spaniards had of long
avoiding the surrender of the city of
Santiago and Admiral Cervera's fleet
to- Admiral Sampson.
As long as they held the Merrimac's
men there as a shield the American
Admiral made his instructions against
firing on Morro Castle most explicit.
In the several bombardments that have
taken place in the vicinity our gunners
have been at a disadvantage because
of this necessary order. They were
most careful in aiming the guns not
to allow a single shot even to threaten
Morro with destruction.
Adm^al Sampson to-day learned
positively that two of the Merrimac's
men had been taken by the Spaniards
to the Marine Hospital, and that all
the others had been removed back to
the city. Upon receiving this informa
tion the admiral immediately rescinded
his order not to fire on Morro Castle.
"One dynamite shell will destroy the
fort," the admiral said, as he dlsc-ussed
with thc>3e on board the flagship the
latest action of the enemy in dealing 1
with Lieutenant Kcbson and his men.
From the first the action of the Span
iards in confining: those prisoners in
Morro under the flre of our guns has
been bitterly condemned by the officers
and men in the fleet.
Another brilliant exploit has beeu
PRICE -FIVE CENTS.
I added to the enviable record which the
; auxiliary cruiser St. Louis is making
â in the operations about Cuba. This
i vessel on Friday night risked being
\ blown to pieces by Spanish guns in a
I final frantic effort to find the cable
: which connects Santiago with King
ston. Orders were issued to the St.
Louis to pick up this cable and cut it.
The former efforts had convinced Ad
miral Sampson it would be impossible

to locate this important cable from any
point beyond the range of Spanish
guns, so the St. Louis boldly steamed
right to the mouth o-f the harbor. She
was discovered by the Spaniards and
searchlights on Morro Castle played
about the fearless American vessel for
a long time.
In making this desperate attempt to
pick up the Kingston cable the St.
Louis advanced to within 300 yards of
Morro's guns, and the men with the
fleet outside momentarily expected to
hear the enemy open fire on the cruiser.
It would have boon a simple matter to
have sunk the St. Louis at such close
range, but for some reason the Span
lards did not fire a single gun. This
led Commodore Schley to express the
opinion that the work done by the dy
namite cruiser Vesuvius in its recent
night attack had so territled the Span
iards that they since have deserted the
batteries at night. After a long search
the St. Louis returned to the fleet and
reported that she had been unable to
find the cable.
One of the most important operations
thus far undertaken by the insurgents
is the effort to capture General Pando
and his men, in which the Cubans are
now engaged. General Pando is on his
way from Havana to give relief to the
Spaniards in Santiago. This relief
party is proceeding by way of Man
zanillo. Generals parcia, Castillo and
Perez, with other Cuban leaders, have
sent out a scouting party to intercept
the Spanish general.
Strong proof that Admiral Cervera
has abandoned the hope of escape with
his fleet from Santiago Harbor was
furnished by his failure to make the
attempt to-day. This seems to have
been his most promising opportunity
to come out and fight if he ever intend
ed to. Cervera would have found about
the harbor only the Brooklyn, Massa
chusetts and Texas of all the American
fighting ships. The New York was off
to Guantanamo, while the Oregon and
lowa were taking coal. Despite this
great weakening of the strength of the
American fleet the Spanish admiral did
not appear to accept a battle on even
terms.
Heliographic communication between
Santiago and Guantanamo by the
Spaniards has finally been Interrupted.
This system has been used to advan
tage by the enemy for several days,
but the Cubans have captured several
intermediate signal posts and thus
have put a stop to It.
There is no sign of the arrival of the
American troops up to 10 o'clock, the
hour at which I close this dispatch.
Their arrival Is awaited with great
eagerness throughout the fleet.
FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN
TO DEFEND SANTIAGO.
Cuban Pilot Supplies Information as
to the Strength of the
Eneniy.
KEY WEST, June 19.â Juan Santos, a
Cuban pilot, who arrived here this
morning on board an American war
ship, reports that he entered Santiago
de Cuba and found there a Spanish gar
rlaon of 15,000 men. He adds the ves
sels of Admiral Cervera's ileet lying at
that port are the armored cruisers Cris
tobal Colon, Vizcaya and Almirante
Oquendo, two small cruisers, two tor
pedo boats and the Reina Mercedes,
which has been stripped of her guns,
which are used to re-enforce the land
batteries. The masts of the sunken col
lier Merrimac were visible above the
water.
The pilot says the Spanish war ves
sels were fully manned, but the crews
were discouraged and disappointed. He
thinks Morro Castle is the only fort not
silenced by Rear Admiral Sampson,
Who, he says, keeps a steady watch and
opens fire as soon as work is attempted
by the Spanish on shore. Morro Castle,
where Lieutenant Hobson and the other
brave men of the Merrimac are now
confined, was not fired upon, the dyna
mite cruiser Vesuvius sending her pro
jectiles over the bluff into the channel.
The land approaches to Santiago de
Cuba are heavily guarded, but the ar
tlllery is innignficant.
Other Information piv^n by the pilot
Is that one Spanish colonel and seven
teen other men who were tak^n prison
ers by the Cubans at Santiago are on
board the collier Abarrando and have
been offered in exchange for Lieuten
ant Hnbson and his companions. The
hospital ship Solace has twenty wound
ed Cubans aboard.
The health of the marines who have
landed in Cuba Is excellent and good
health also prevails on board the ves
sels of the American fleet. The Amer
ican officers speak highly of the effi
ciency and bravery of the Cuban sol
diers.

Private Telegrams Tell of the
Enemy's Shells Doing Great
Damage to Our Warships.
MADRID, June 19, 3 p. m.â Private
telegrams received here from Cuba say
that during the last attack by the
American ships upon Santiago de Cuba
a Spanish shell struck upon the deck
of one of the attacking ships, sweeping
off all the men there. Another shell,
according to the same authority, struck
the funnel of a cruiser, doing much
damage.
The Havana government is display
ing great energy. Fourteen university
professors, who Hod for fear of the re
sults of the war. have bfen dismissed.
The blockading vessels, the telegrams
say, continue inactive.
Captain Aunon, Minister of Marine,
refuses to give any information regard-
Ing the destination of Admiral Ca

declare that the statements that the
bodies of American marines killed at
Guantanamo were mutilated by the
Spanish troops and similar sentiments
regarding the loss of the Maine are
made with the object of inflaming the
American populace.

One Hundred and Ninety-Five Men
to Fill Vacancies Created by
the Reorganization
Bill.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 19.â At a late
hour to-night Adjutant General Corbin
made public the names of the 195 young
men who have been selected for ap
pointment as second lieutenants in the
regular army to fill the vacancies cre
ated by the act of Congress adapting
the three battalion organizations of in
fantry and the addition of one second
lieutenant to all batteries when filled to
war strength. Each of the 195 men se
lected will be obliged to undergo an
examination that will be a thorough
test of his mental and physical qualifi
cations for the army service. Those

named by the President to the Senate.
To the selection of the men both the
President and Secretary of War have
devoted time and consideration. Out of
the 195 appointed eighty-nine are

all representing sixty-seven different |
istitutions. Forty-eight are now in the i
volunteer or militia service and thir
teen are enlisted men in the regular
army.
Never before has there been such
vitality and new blood injected into the
military service. Army officers view
with satisfaction, and West Point men
more than all others, that sixty-seven
different college notions and methods
are going to be put on trial alongside
of West Point and army methods. More
than 7000 applications for appoint
ments were filed at the War Depart
ment.

fore the battle was over was at his
country villa beyond the city. He had
not even allowed his captains to know
where the Cavite anchorage was
mined, and tl s is given as a reason
why some of the mines were exploded
before the American ships approached
them. They were exploded in order to
give Sranish vessels a chance to cross
the line.
Colonel San Miguel of the Jjattery
committed suicide when he found the
supply of ammunition was not what
had been represented. Frauds had been
committed which had disposed of the
stock.
The Archbishop of Manila has issued
a pastoral in which he declares:
"Very soon the country will see an
insurmountable barrier placed between
you and -your masters; there will be
then for you no situation nor repre
sentation, nor can you even participate
in the government of the towns. You
will be reduced to a separate civil state,
villified and degraded like those of the
lowest caste, and like miserable labor
ers reduced to the condition of coolies,
and further to that of beasts or ma
chines, supplied or fed by a handful of
rice thrown in your faces as a daily al
lowance, simply to secure the fruits of
your labor. This is not all. The worst
is that you will see the . ruin of your
temples or that they will be turned into
Protestant chapels, where there is no
altar. Oh, this is hard! God, the Vir
gin and all are gone and the cross will
have disappeared from your ceme
teries, the crucifix from your schools
and the ministers of the true God who
made you Christians through baptism."
He urges the Spanish to resist with
all their power the Americans.
There is a strong anti-British feel
ing among the Spanish in Manila, who
are of the opinion that the English peo
ple have shown their sympathy with
the United States too openly. It is
claimed by the Spanish that the Brit
ish Government even supplied a pilot
to take the fleet into Manila harbor.
Captain Cobban of the collier Zanro
was accused of being the pilot.
A dispatch from Canton tells of a pi
ratical raid sixty miles above the city.
Pirates boarded the Chinese steamer
Wingsal at Canton as passengers, and.
reaching a favorable point, attacked
the crew, which resisted, and after sev
eral hours fighting drove them from the
boat. The steamer drifted ashore dur
ing the struggle and had not been
floated several days later.
Serious rioting is reported from
Shashi, in China. The customs sta
tion was burned and the Commissioner
of Customs made away with. The Brit
ish consulate was attacked and the
flagstaff torn down and the flag torn to
shreds. The building was then burned
to the ground.
RepoTts from Canton state that the
grave diggers are not able to keep up
with the death list from the plague.
There are reports of serious diffi
culty between the Chinese and French
Governments, arising from the fact
that French experts were employed to
take charge of the Foo Chow arsenal.
The French assumed too much author
ity and their contract w-as annulled
and pay withheld. The hitch was re
ported to the French Minister at Pek
ing, and resulted in sending two war
ships to Foo Chow, taking p. position
where the arsenal would be at the
mercy of the French guns. The Chi
nese directors were prevented from flee

would be a signal to seize the ar

SPARRING FOR
ANNEXATION
Friends of the Scheme
Harassed.
CHANGE THE PLAN OF ACTION
JOINT RESOLUTION INSTEAD
OF A TREATY.
Great Activity of the Opposition In
dicates That the Senate Win
Take No Action This
Session.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON,' 'June 19.â The Ha
waiian question will again come to the
front in the Senate during the present
week, but under somewhat different
circumstances from those which at
tended its presentation at the beginning
of the session. The purpose was then,
as It is now, to secure the annexation
of the islands for the United States, but
the effort at that time was to secure
this result by means of a treaty,
whereas the present course was through
the instrumentaJity of ajolntresolutlon.
On the first occasion the matter was
considered in executive session with the
public excluded, while now the doors
are to be thrown open and the world
invited.
What the outcome of the question
may lie, or when the vote may be
reached, no one will undertake to say
positively. The leaders on both sides
are full of prophecy, but there Is so
much discrepancy between their opin
ions as to render it necessary to discard
one in order to accept the other. The
friends of annexation assert there is
no possible doubt of their ability to
pass the resolution, and say they have
forty-six Senators, or one more than a
quorum, pledged to remain in the Sen
ate until the question can be decided,
while the opposing leaders declare that
forty-eight Senators huve assured
them they will vote to adjourn in pref
erence to remaining in session indefi
nitely for the consideration of the Ha
waiian question.
The supporters of the proposition ex
press confidence that action will be se
cured within ten days, while the op
position contend that it will be found
to be impossit.l% to secure a vote dur
ing the present session of Congress.
The advocates of annexation declare
that they will not make any speeches,
leaving the opponents to occupy all the
time to be consumed by this means.
The opposition say they are willing to
make the speeches if compelled to do
so, but that if forced to do this they
will insist that the friends of the meas
ure shall maintain a constant quorum
in the chamber. They also predict that
the annexationists will find themselves
compelled to participate in the proceed
ings, as they expect to advance points
which will demand refutation, or at
least reply.
In view of this generally contradic
tory condition one can only base a pre
diction upon general conditions. There
is no doubt, In the first place, that the
annexationists have a majority in the
Senate if a vote can be reached. If a
vote could be gotten now the result
would be about 54 for^annexation to 35
against in a full Senate. Of these fifty
four Senators there are, however, quite
a number who are not zealous and in
whose minds all doubt as to the polioy
of acquisition of outside territory has
not been overcome. These Senators, as
a rule, are indisposed to remain in ses
sion for any length of time during the
hot summer months to consider Hawa
iian annexation. Most of the Senators
of this class are Republicans, and there
are probably a sufficient number of
them under normal circumstances to
join with the Democrats to force an ad
journment. They find themselves con
fronted, however, with the request of
the administration to remain and pass
the resolution as a war measure, and
some of them are disposed to sink their
own preferences in obedience to the
Presidential wish.
The gossip as to the probability of a
postponement until a fixed day in the
next session increases and many per
sons are predicting that this will be the
outcome of the contest. A test vote
probably will be secured Monday on
the taking up of the resolution, as It
will be necessary in order to get It up
to displace other measures on the cal
endar. _______ _______

BUSINESS SECTION BURNED
THREE BLOCKS OF BUILDINGS
IN ASHES.
Having No Fire-Fighting Facilities,
the Citizens Strive Vainly to
Save the Town From De
struction.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TRACY, June 19.â Three blocks of
buildingsâ the entire business portion
of Tracyâ are in ruins. Fire started at
12:45 o'clock in a restaurant on Front
street occupied by Mrs. Mary Mann.
It was caused by the explosion of a
gasoline stove. The wind was blowing
a gale and the efforts of the citizens
to stay the flames were of no avail.
The conflagration died out only when
there was nothing more for it to con
sume.
There was some hope o-f intercepting
the fire when it reached the Odd Fel
lows' Hail, a new three-story brick
building, but it burned as if it were a
bundle of shavings. Some people lost
their effects after they had been moved
into the street.
The residence portion of the town was
saved by the hard work of the citizens.
C. E. Rosin suffered the fracture of a
leg by jumping from the seccmd-story
of Odd Fellows' Hall. Two switch en
gines of the Southern Pacific Company
were brought into requisition, but were
of no avail. The whole city front is
now one mass of blackened ruins.
The first two blocks which were
burned faced the main street in a sort
of half circle, the third block being
built on a different line. After devour
ing the frame building where the fire
started, the flames destroyed the Com
mercial Hotel, Maroon's saloon, G.
Buschke's building, occupied as a gen
eral merchandise store, the Arlington
Hotel and Fabian & Co.'s general mer
chandise store. The flames then jumped
the street, leveling the Tracy Hotel, the
San Joaquin Hotel, Buddworth's mer
ohandise store, Ludwig's saloon and
residence, the Odd Fellows' building,
Canale Bros.' store, two unoccupied
buildings and the residence of Mrs.
Byrnes.
Again the flames leaped a street and
destroyed the residence of Mrs. Gaf
fery, a bakery, the residences of C. O.
Hill, John Hess, of E. Gieseke and
Gieseke's livery stable. The horses
were saved before the fire reached the
stable. Eight windmills and tank
houses in the three blocks were de
stroyed.

PARK CITY SWEPT
BY A CONFLAGRATION
Flames Destroy Property Valued
at About One Million
Dollars.
SALT LAKE, Utah, June 19.â A spe
cial to the Tribune from Park City,
Utah, says: To-night the ideal mining
camp of Park City is a mass of un
sightly ruins. The fire to which it suc
cumbed began at 4 o'clock this morning
and continued -with awful fury for
nearly eight hours. Main street, from
the point at which the fire originated
to the Union Pacific Depot, is ruined.
Park avenue has sustained losses that
cannot be computed with any degree
of accuracy. The Chinese quarter is
completely wiped out and not a dwell
ing remains on Rossie Hill.
The fire originated in the Freeman
House or American Hotel. Twenty min
utes later great crowds of people filled
the streets. The flames spread from
the original structure and sped north
ward. The John Funk barber shop,
Thompson & Jorgensen's butcher shop
and the Ives & Keith STables were en
veloped. The wind swept on, urging
the flames, that were now whipped
across the street, where they attacked
Dahlgreen's residence, a weak but
pretty structure, that succumbed like
chaff. Then the grocery store con
ducted by W. H. Roy was consumed.
Business blocks and dwellings were
swept away alike. Through the busi
ness houses the fire gnawed its way
and reached the residences on Park
avenue. Here reside the aristocratic
portion of Park City's population. One
by one on the east side of this avenue
the dwellings fell. No less than sev
enty-five residences, valued at from
$500 to $3000 each, were reduced.
Along Main street one business block
after another fell, the entire Fire De
partment, re-enforced by thousands of
willing hands, together with all ap
paratus, including three hose carts and
a hook-and-ladder truck, was engaged
in the struggle.
Appeals for help were addressed to
Salt Lake and Ogden, and at 10:15
o'clock a squad of Salt Lake's Fire
Department arrived. Following it
was a troop from the Ogden Fire De
partment. The fire at the time had
reached the Crescent concentrator, the
northern extremity of its course, which
fell with a deafening crash. The aux
iliary department turned its streams to
play around the Marsac Mill, making a
desperate fight to save that historical
structure. Three streams, fed by a
reservoir above, were played upon it
from 4:15 to 9:30 a. m.
The estimated loss is about $1,000,000,
with light insurance, which is distrib
uted among a large number of compa
nies. The actual figures cannot be ob
tained to-night.

CHICKAMAUGA, CHATTANOOGA
NATIONAL PARK, Ga,. June 19.âTo
day was an exceptionally beautiful one
at Camp Thomas and a cool breeze con
tinuously astir made park life a de
light It was significantly a day of rest
among 1 the soldiers. All drills were
omitted and the Sabbath was generally
observed. In this respect the day was
somewhat in contrast with many of its
predecessors. The chaplains of the va
rious regiments held services and the
Y. M. C. A. and evangelistic cohorts
were actively at work. The reverence
with which these services were listened
to and the general good order which
prevailed among the camps were sig
nificant of the high moral tone which
pervades the entire army. The soldiers
were forbidden to congregate at points
of amusement and practically all re
mained in camp with the exception of
some who had permission to spend the
day on Lookout Mountain.
The efforts of General Boynton and
the Georgia authorities to restore order
at Lytle and rid the outskirts of gamb
ling houses have been productive of
good results. At Lytle to-day all sa
loons and gambling houses were her
metically closed.
Six hundred recruits for various regi
ments arrived during the day, making
a total for three days of nearly 1800,
and the daily arrivals promise to in
crease rapidly. Prominent among to- 1
day's arrivals were the following: Brig
adier General Peter C. Hayes, Third
Division, First Army Corps; Brigadier
General J. P. Sanger, Sixth Army
Corps, under General "Wilson; Major
Clayton Parkhill, Surgeon United
States, First Division, First Army

signed as surgeon in Merritt's camp
and was to have gone to Manila ac
cording to first orders.
PORTLAND, Ore., June 19.â Early
this morning a special train over the
Northern Pacific arrived from St. Paul
with 312 men and three commissioned
officers to recruit the Thirteenth Min

imum. They left shortly after for San
Francisco in a special train over the
Southern Pacific. In every seat of the
train boxes of lunch and a pail#of
strawberries had been placed early In
the evening by women of the Oregon
Emergency Corps. The seats and walls
of the cars were brightened with flow
ers in profusion.
Twenty-seven recruits left here for
San Francisco to-night to join the Sec
ond Oregon Volunteer Regiment in
Manila.
WASHINGTON, June 19.â 1f practi
cable, the commissary branch of the
War Department will make arrange
ments for the supply 01 the troops
which go to the Philippines with fresh
beef and fresh vegetables In reason
able quantities. Those soldiers who
have started already to Manila have a
supply of canned beef, but the prefer
ence of the men naturally is for the
fresh or refrigerated article, and It is
probable if adequate room aboard the
steamers can be secured the depart
ment will send a "arge quantity to the
i<=land3. Onions, potatoes and canned
tomatoes constitute the principal arti
cles of the soldiers' diet, and an effort
will be made to s^nd an ample supply
with eacn ship thr-t goes to the islands
that can accomodate them.

THROUGH A DANGEROUS
SURGICAL OPERATION
Senator Hanna's Brother Gets a New
Lease of Life After Great
Suffering.
BOSTON, June 19.â H. Melville Hanna,
brother of Senator Mark Hanna, has re
cently undergone a serious surgical opera
tion in Boston, from the effects of which
he is now slowly recovering. The oper
ation was performed at St. Margaret's
Hospital, and was a most delicate one,
successful results having been attained
In only eight instances in the history of
surgery. The operation was for an af
fliction of the throat, caused by the for
mation of a small sack behind the aeso
phagus, which made the swallowing of
food practically impossible. In order to
reach the seat of the disease an opening
was made on the side of the neck, extend
ing around the larynx and aesophagus,
through a multiple of small blood ves
sels. Although attended with great dan
ger, the sac was successfully removed
and the opening closed by Dr. Maurice A
Richardson, Boston's foremost surgeon'
and an old-time Harvard athlete, who was
the operating physician.

QUICK MOVE
ON PORTO RICO
Expedition Is to Leave
Early in July.
PREPARATIONS ARE RUSHED
GENERAL MILES ATTENDING TO
THE DETAILS.
It Is Expected Santiago Will Have
Fallen Before the Army
Is Ready to
Start.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 19.â A "Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Offi
cials in the "War Department ar* of the
opinion that the Porto Rico expedition
will leave the United States early in
July. Most active preparations are be
ing made under the direct supervision
of Major General Miles to hurry this
expedition as rapidly as possible-. Or
ders have been issued to the chiefs vt
Ihe various bureaus connected with
the fitting out of an army to rush sup
plies with all speed to Femandinn.
It is hoped by the officials of the ad
ministration that by the time the ex
pedition is in readiness to leave the
United States the city of bantiago and
Admiral Cervera's fleet will have sur
rendered to the joint land and navel
forces of the United States. If such is
the case the larger part of the fleet can
be withdrawn fn i Santi 30 and sent
to San Juan to shell the forts at that
place and incidentally protect the land
ing army.
Most extensive preparations for the
embarking of troops are being made at
Fernandina. Major General Miles,
having himself seen the departure ..f
the Santiago expedition, knows exactly
the cause of the delay experienced in
getting off that army and does not in
tend that there shall be any repetition
of the trouble in sending his command
away. The army that will constitute
the Porto Rican expedition will be se- A
lected from the ; rmy at all points of*
encampment. he object of General
Miles is to take with him the very best
equipped and organized troops now In
the United States, regardless of the
present situation.
CORBETTS NEW PLAY,
"A KENTUCKY HERO.''
Written by a California Friend of the
Ex-Champion and Praised by
the Critics.
NEW YORK, June 19.â "A Kentucky
Hero" is the title of a military comedy
drama which may .be produced by James
J. Corbett next season, says a local pa
per. The piece is by Robert Jefferson Fer
ral, son of ex-Judge Ferral of California,
an old-time friend of the former cham
pion. Corbett has just finished a careful
reading of the play and thinks very well
of it.
"Before considering the play I read
some criticisms on it, written by the wisa
gentlemen who try to mold the opinion,
of theater-goers on the coast." said Cor
bett. "Most of the opinions were partic
ularly strong in favor of the piece, and I
don't think undue praise has been be
stowed. If Mr. Brady likes the piece as
well as I do we shall certainly produce it
next season. I am inclined to think, how
ever, that we might select a better title
for it."
The play is on the order of "The Heart
of Maryland."
M'KINLEY'S WARNING
DISPLEASES SPANIARDS
MADRID, June 19. 9 p. m.â The state
ment that President McKinley has
sent to Admiral Cervera and General
Pando messages saying that he would
hold them personally responsible for
the lives of Lieutenant Hobson and his
men has produced a disagreeable im
pression here in military circles, as
showing that President McKinley dis
trusts the military honor of the Span
iards, who, on their part, despise all
threats. Such messages, it is declared,
render the future exchange of the pris
oners most unlikely.

IS (via Kingston, Jamaica, June

that the Inhabitants of Caima
nera have strewn the streets with
straw and oil with the intention
of destroying the city and fleeing
to the hills. Caimanera lies four
miles up the bay from Camp Mc-
Calla, under the guns of the
American ships and the situation
is desperate. Strsrvir.pr and fam
ine-stricken, convinced of the ul
â  triumph of the American
arms and without faith in the
protection of the Spanish sol

have determined to leave their
bouses in ashes behind them and
seek safety in the hills of the
north. The scouts declare that
building of the town is be

an American prize.
The scouts also say that the Spanish

state of panic as are the civilians and
that they could easily be induced to

they were on their way to Guantanamo

on the sloop proved that they had been
Bent to obtain information relative to

Spanish commander of the Cape Maysi

There was a brief bombardment of a
' blockhouse up the bay by the battle
; ship Oregon yesterday and it is believed
that at least a score of Spaniards were
i killed. Scouting parties report that the
blockhouse was completely destroyed,
but that they were unable to discover
any bodies, the remais of the soldiers
i who had been killed probably having
been carried off by their comrades.
Late this afternoon the flagship New
York returned to the fleet off Santiago
de Cuba,
The marines are growing very rest
less, owing to the delay in the arrival
of the reinforcements of troops, but it
is generally believed here to-day that
the transports will reach Santiago not
later than Monday.
A rumor to the effect that Lieutenant
Hobson and his fellow heroes have been
seen on the walls of Morro Castle under
a Spanish guard caused much excite
ment among the fleet off Santiago to
day, but the story is discredited on
Commodore Schley's flagship. The offi
| cers say that the Spanish sentries were
mistaken as to the American prisoners.
SAN JUAN EXPECTS
AN EARLY ATTACK
Fortifications Strengthened and
Mines Laid at the Harbor
Entrance.
NEW YORK, June 19.â The Herald
correspondent at San Juan, Porto Rico,
sends the following under date of June
'.<: Since the bombardment of the city
on May 12 there has been a general
feeling of unrest, uneasiness and un
â¢ iii. tint;,' as to what is to come next,
as it is too clearly evident that matters
will not rest long in statu quo. None
of the Spanish fleet have arrived in
port yet except the torpedo-boat Ter
ror, which is thought to be a grand
acquisition to the defenses. Her sis
ter vessel, the Furor, lies at Martinique,
ling to latest advices. The other
warships in port are the usual ones â
the Isabella 11, Ponce de Leon and
the Concha. The armed transatlantic
steamship Alfonso XIII lies laden with
provisions f<">r Santiago or Borne othfr
Cuban port, but does not seem inclined
to move out. She made a quick run a
few days ago to Mayaguez and Ponce
to carry provisions to the small garri
sons there.
l'ro\ Isions are very scarce and prices
have been Increased 75 per ci ia above
the normal. In the interior of the
island the conditions are titill worse.
No work is being done on the estates.
Thousands of men are unemployed and
misery and hunger are rife. Prisoners
are working briskly on earthworks and
are repairing and strengthening batter
ies.
The mines at the harbor entrance
h;ivÂ«' li">-n laid further seaward, cov
ering all the lines the United States
took during the bombardment,
which was too close in to have effect
on Morro, which lies on the flat top of
the cliff.
The island has now a population of
1,000,000. The purely Spanish element
may be counted as only one-tenth of
the whole.
OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
TO ARMY OFFICERS.
Secretary Alger Renders a Decision
Sustaining the Paymaster
General.
WASHINGTON, June 19.â Secretary i
Ah r hns*rendered a decision of great'
importance to army officers, in which
he holds that men serving within the 'â 
Hi;, Us of the United States at a tii.it- j
I when theve Is no foreign army within j
paid limits are not "operating against
an enemy," notwithstanding the exist- j
ence of war conditions. The case upon |
which the decision was based arose in j
connection with the claim of some offl- j
cers who had exercised a higher com- j
mand than their gTade, and who con
tended they were entitled to the pay
of the higher grade. The paymaster- j
general maintained that the troops I
were not operating against the enemy j
until they had actually left the shores â 
of the United States, ar.d in this he j
is upheld by the Secretary. The Sec- j
rotary has decided also that for the i
purpose of restricting assignments to
command under Section 'i o-f the volun- !
teer army to "competent authority,"
such authority can be exercised only
by the Secretary of War or by the
commanding general of an army "oper
ating against an enemy."

ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS DISPATCH BOAT DAUNT
LESS, OFF SA-.TIAGO De' CUBA,
June 18 (via Kingston Jamafca, June
19).â A careful inspection of : the for
tifications along the crest qf the hills
defending Santiago Harbor^since the
bombardment Thursday morning shows
the American gunners spread wreck
and ruin everywhere. Some of the bat
teries were demolished beyond re
pair. The vultures which circled over
the hills as thi^k as swallows around
a chimney for hours after the firing
ceased furnished grewsoroe evidence of
thi fatality among the Spanish soldiers.
Hundreds of troops could be seen from
the ships digging in mounds of earth
piled by the explosions of the projec
tiles from the heavy guns for bodies,
while their heads were fanned by the
wluks of tho black scavengers of the
lield.
There wi re two spots, one on the east
and the other en the west of the harbor
entrance, which wpre denuded of foli
age. The hill tops soemed literary
blown away. These marked the piaces
where the two hundred pound eh
Of guncotton blown by the Vesuvius
landed.
Itut thf most ominous token of death
flew from MOITO Castle. The saffron
flag of Spain was half-masted for sev
eral hours. The significance of this is
j not known. It is not customary to half
â  mast Hags, but possibly some Spanish
j leader was killed by the heavy tire of
! the guns, though some officers of the
j squadron believe the flag was half
i masted as a notification to the Ameri
i cans that Lieutenant Ilobson and his
' brave men were dead. If such is the
case they must have been wantonly
| murdered. The Spanish might seek to
i lay their death to the bombardment,
| but not a shot from the Americans
| struck the fortress.
Neither Admiral Sampson nor Cotn
i modore Schley believe that Lieutenant
Hobson and his party have been killed.
We have seventeen prisoners taken at
i Guantanatno, including a lieutenant,
besides a number in the United States,
for reprisals <>r exchange.
There was evident demoralization
i among the Spanish troops during the
! bombardment. Officers could be seen,
; with drawn swords, driving the men to
| the guns, but even then they could not
j be forced to stay so long as our flre
j was directed at them. Fifteen minutes'
night work of the Vesuvius had shat
tered their nerves.
It is believed by some that the 13-
I inch projectile fired from the Texas,
which was reported to have exploded
the powder magazine in one of the
western batteries, did not fall in the
battery, but went beyond and blew up
one of the ships in the harbor.
A dramatic incident of thÂ» bombard
ment was the act of a Spanish officer,
who bravely ran along the parapet un
der a heavy fire, encouraging his men
to stand their ground. Shot and shell
rained about him, and, after one terrific
explosion, he was scon no more and the
parapet had disappeared. He could not
have escaped death.
From the foretop of the Brooklyn,
2900 yards distant, the men in the
grounds could be noticed, but a min
ute later dust and flying debris would
take their places, and when the smoke
raised only a spot of red earth could
be seen â guns and gunners had been
swept away. It was thÂ» most deadly
and destructive bombardment of the
war this far. Scarcely a shot from the
big guns of the squadron v.ent astray.
The aim of our gunners was superb,
and not only were the cr.-ast forts anni
hilated, but the batteries on Cayo '
Smith, up the harbor, were destroyed.
Had ail the ships used smokeless pow
der, as did the New Orleans, there
would remain no signs of guns or forti
fications to Indicate that there had ever
been any defenses there.
There were no casualties on our fleet,
tho-ugh our Bhips held a fixed position.
The half-stripped ships' gunners never
worked with more enthusiasm. The
words of Rear- Admiral Sampson were:
"First silence the batteries on the
shore and then continue firing until the
fortifications are reduced."
This order was stri-tly obeyed. It
was the first time such instructions
had been given and the men responded
with a will. In thirty-eight minutes
the order was given to cease firing and
the message went to each ship from
the admiral:
' Well done."
The officers and men turned in for
breakfast. Every detail of the engage
ment had been executed to the letter,
from the opening of iire by the New
i'ork to the last shot from the lowa.
The Spaniards evidently were sur
prised while strengthening their forti
flcat ions.
Thp first shot from the New York
landed full and fair on the top of the
hills to the east, where the gunners
were already at work erecting new
pieces. The earth 'seemed to rise in
a cloud, and when the 12-inch shells of
the lowa and the 12-inch beauties of
the Oregon landed, squarely and fairly
a great cheer went up from the ships.
The Western squadron got into line
and began firing before the eastern one
did, and the effect of the shots could
be plainly seen. The Spanish gunners
at the batteries could be noted and a
quick fire was returned, but only for
a brief time did they withstand the
terrible assault of the fleet.
HAVANA BLOCKADE
TO BE REENFORCED
Vessels Which Convoyed the Fleet of
Transports Will Return to
Their Posts.
NEW YORK, June ID.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald gays: In ac
cordance with instructions given him
Rear Admiral Sampson will immediate
ly take measures to re-enforce the block
ade squadron on the safe arrival of
troops at Santiago. With the excep
tion of the battlosMp Indiana and the
torpedo boats which accompanied the
troops, the convoy squadron will be
ordered to proceed with all dispatch
back to the western end of Cuba to re
sume its station at the points where it
was located before It was attached to
the convoying fleet. As a result of the
return of these vessels, about fourteen
in number, the authorities say there
will be no further danger of blockade
runners getting through to Cuban
ports.
To Repair the Cable.
MOLE ST. NICHOLAS, June 19.â For
several days the French cable com
pany has been trying to re-establish
its broken cable between here and
Guantanamo and Santiago. Its repair
steamer Mancel finally sailed yesterday
from here to make the repairs, so that
commercial business, which has been
interrupted for the past ten days, can
again be accepted by the French cable
lines. It is understood that the United
States authorities -will permit this
cable to be worked commercially un
der the supervision of its censor, as is
the case with the cable between Ha
vana and Key West.

Are Warmly Praised by
Sampson,
OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, June 18
(via Kingston, Jamasca, June 19). â
Several attempts to find landing places
for the United States troops within a
distance of two miles west of Santiago
have determined, with previous inquir
ies to the eastward, that the shore for
fifteen miles is lined with Spaniards.
While this will not prevent a landing
close to Santiago it may entail con
siderable delay, as the surrounding
country must be thoroughly shelled and
cleared before the troops can land In
safety.
When Rear-Admiral Sampson yester
day received advices that upward of
thirty transports would be here to-day
(Saturday) he sent word that they
should stand to the south ten miles and
lie there until a landing place had been
secured.
Yesterday at daylight the launches
of the New York and Massachusetts
reconnoitered the shore between Ca
banas, two miles westward of the en
trance to Santiago harbor, and Guaya
cano, two miles further west, both of
which points lie east of the range of
mountains surrounding Santiago Bay.
The launches pushed their noses into
a hornets' nest. The brush was fairly
alive with Spanish troops, infantry and
cavalry, and the fire opened upon tha
launches was so fierce that their re
treat had to be covered by the Vixen
and Texas.
When the Texas asked permission of
Commodore Schley to take a hand the
commodore seized the megaphone and
shouted to Captain Philips: "Yes, go in
and give 'em , Jack!"
The Texas landed several 4-inch
shells on the battery at Cabanas, com
pletely demolishing it. Lieutenant
Sharpe of the Vixen and Lieutenant
Harlow, in command of the launches,
were both complimented by Admiral
Sampson for gallantry.
It is believed the insurgents, who are
In force and under the command of
General Garcia, about fifteen miles
west, will render effective aid in driv
ing the Spanish skirmishers off the
shore.

MOLE ST. NICHOLAS, Hayti, June
19.â The big collier Alexander arrived
at 7 o'clock this morning with a cargo
for the fleet. She is commanded by
Captain W. L Burrcll and Is direct
from Hampton Roads. On board the
Alexander is the youngest "man" In
the United States navy. He is William

15 years old. He was appointed by Sec
retary Long . before the Alexander
sailed. Willie acts as flag lieutenant
and is eager to fight Spain.
The Alexander on her way hore over
hauled a Norwegian bark that looked
like a Spanish ship. A high sea was
running at the time. From one boat in
which were men sent to board the bark
two were thrown into the water near
the steamer's side. Willie superin
tended the lowering of the other, .boat
and saved their lives. When his*Â»ther
complimented him for his gallantry he
said simply:
"I am sorry, papa, she was not a
Spanish warship."
The Alexander's entire armament
consists of two 3-inch guns.
FRESNO VOLUNTEER
COMMITS SUICIDE.
His Mind Probably Unbalanced by a
Blow Received While Resist-
ing Arrest.
BENICIA, June 19.â Private Joseph
E. Phelps of Company C, Sixth Cali
fornia Volunteer Infantry, located at
Benicia Barracks, shot himself through
the heart with his own rifle this after
noon, dying instantly. He obtained
some notoriety a few weeks ago In San
Francisco by resisting arrest. During
the scuffle he received a severe blow on
the head from a musket, since which
time he has been apparently of unsound
mind To-day his companions noticed
him working his rifle with his foot, with
the muzzle pressed against the body.
Evidently he was testing his intended
method of ending his life.
The officers say that Phelps was a
very good soldier, always obeying or
ders promptly, but he acted as though
he felt keenly disgraced since the affair
in the city.
Phelps was 34 years old. He waa born
in Philadelphia and resided for some
time in Pittsburg. He was in Califor
nia but a few months. He Joined his
company in Fresno. Very little is
known of his private affairs. The offi
cers of the company believe his mother
and sister live somewhere near Fresno.
He will be buried to-morrow.

ant Harlow's report to the commander
of the Vixen, dated June 18:
"The expedition consisted of a steam
launch from the Massachusetts in
charge of Cadet Hart and a launch
from the New York in charge of Cadet
Powell. I took passage on the Massa
chusetts' launch, leading the way.
Soundings were taken on entering the
bay close under tho old fort, and we
were preparing to circumnavigate the
bay at full speod when fire was opened
from the fort and rocks on shore. The
Massachusetts' launch was some dis
tance ahead and about forty yards off
the fort. There was no room to turn,
and our one-pounder could not be
brought to bear. We backed and turned
under a heavy fire.
"Cadet Hart operated the gun as soon
as it could be brought to bear, sitting
exposed in the bow and working the
gun as coolly and as carefully as if at
target practice. Cadet Powell harl been
firing since the Spaniards opened. He
also was perfectly cool. Both launches
ran out under a heavy fire. The num
ber of Spaniards along the shore was
largo. The launches, as soon as was
practicable, sheered to give the Vixen
the range of the fort. The Vixen and
Texas silenced the shore fire promptly.
"I strongly commend Cadet Hart and
Cadet Powell for their cool management
of the launches. One launch was struck
several times, but nobody on either
was hurt. A bullet struck a shell at
Cadet Hart's foot between the pro
jectile and the powder, but failed to
explode the latter.
"Cockswain O'Donnell and Seaman
Bloom are commended, as is also the
coolness with which the marines and
sailors worked under the Spanish fire.
"Nothing was learned at Cabanas
Bay, but at Guayagance it is evident
a landing is practicable for ships' boats.
The same is true of Ranco Cruz, a
small bay at the eastward. Both would
be valuable with Cabanas, but useless
without it. I am informed that to the
north and westward of Cabanas Bay
there is a large clearing with plenty of
ground, grass and water. I think a
simultaneous landing within the three
places named would be practicable if
the ships shell the adjacent woods. A
junction would naturally follow at the
clearing."

At 2 o'clock on the morning of June
15 the Yuen Sans passed the steamer

that although the rebels hold the town
at their mercy, Admiral Devvey re

Manila has now surrendered.

([ FLATTERING TRADE EXHIBIT.
THERE were three distinctive features to trade
last weekâ the collapse of the Leiter wheat deal
at Chicago, the passage of the war tax bill by
Congress and the opening of the subscriptions to the
new war bonds. The success of the latter is already
practically assured The idea of dividing the bonds
into small amounts, as low as $20, proved to be a
â wise one, for the public are taking hold of them so
freely that no syndicate, from present indications,
will be found necessary to float the whole loan. In
deed offers from investors already amount to three
times the amount wanted, and it will probably prove
the most successful loan ever invited by the United
States. An especially gratifying feature is that these
bonds will be almost exclusively held by the Ameri
can people, and thus both principal and interest will
be kept at home. This is the French plan and works
to a charm in that country. It is the second of its
kind in the United States.
The business situation is showing steady improve
ment. The export movement of the country is enor
mous, the excess of exports over imports in May
being about $57,000,000, making a balance in favor
of the United States for the first eleven months of
the current fiscal year of $571,889,000, an unprece
dented exhibit. The imports of gold during this
period -were $102,027,000, the best previous record
being $97,466,000 in 18S2. These flattering figures
are the direct result of an immense foreign demand
for our breadsruffs, provisions, manufactured prod
nets, cotton and general merchandise, very large rail
road earnings and a fine and continuous distributive
trade throughout the whole country. In fact, busi
ness during the past year has been away ahead of
anything eTer before known, and has been really a
commercial boom, without any assistance from specu
lation.
"While the East and South axe far from dull, the
West and Northwest are the scenes of the greatest
activity, and have been for 'months. Owing to their
geographical position they are most readily affected
by the brilliant crop prospects and the advance in
provisions and livestock. Their cities show the
largest gains in the bank clearings, which, for the
country as a whole, exhibited a gain last week of
f\ j per cent over the same week in 1897. The coun
try's failures were Temarkably small, being only 207,
against 234 for the corresponding week last year.
The cotton and wool markets are both showing con
tinued improvement, though there is room for still
greater activity in both of these important staples.
The iron trade holds its own, the West showing the
greatest animation.
As showing that the fine business of the country
is substantial and not speculative it may be pointed
out that the public still holds aloof from Wall street,
where the professional manipulators remain monarchs
of all they survey. During the early part of the
week there was a decline in most stocks, but toward
the close there was a reaction and prices again
showed a recovering tendency.
The leading trade features in this city during the
week were a stagnant and declining grain market,
a better trade in fruit and continued activity in hides,
leather and provisions at firm prices. The dry win
ter is beginning to show its effects in an advancing
market for sheep and hogs, and incidentally their
products, as both are getting more or less scarce.
Beef is less affected, as there is no scarcity in cattle
thus far, though that may come later on. The war
has thus far been profitable to San Francisco, as the
quartering of large bodies of troops and the fitting
out of the Philippine expeditions have created an
extra demand for supplies of all sorts, but particularly
provisions and clothing. The shipping interest, al
most exclusively controlled in this city, has also
come in for its share in this extra demand. So San
Francisco has no cause to lament the war from a
commercial standpoint.
Prospects for the farmer continue exceptionally
bright Good prices are almost sure to rule for the
major part of his products. Already certain va
rieties of fruit, notably peaches and apricots, are get
ting scarce, and quotations are advancing daily in
consequence. The canners are out in the country
bidding $3S@4P per ton for small-sized apricots
which they would not buy in ordinary years, and it is
reported on good authority that the enormous price
of $70 per ton is being bid for cling peaches. Jack
Frost did his work pretty thoroughly last spring,
though the reports of damage were scoffed at as
usual. Beans will be scarce, owing to the dry, win
ter, and hay will sell at advanced prices for the same
reason. All grains, too, bid fair to bring unusually
good figures, if California had had the ordinary
rains the State would have fairly boomed. As it is
the farmers as a class will do much better than for
a number of years, though in two or three sections
the crop will be too short to benefit the agriculturist.
It is strange that everybody but the police can walk
along Kearny' street in the evening and sec a lot of
hoodlums who ought to be in jail and whose ultimate
destination is undoubtedly the gallows.
THE WOR OUTLOOK.
OUR preparations for aggressive war have now
jeen well nigh completed. We have driven the
Spanish from the sea, and our troops are on
the way to complete the conquest of the Philippines
and Spain's colonies in the West Indies. We are
virtually ready to make a descent upon Spain herself
if it should be necessary, and from this time forward
it may be assumed we shall force the fighting and
bring the war, if possible, to a swift conclusion.
Despite the clamor of yellow journals to the con
trary, this work of preparation has been done with
remarkable efficiency and dispatch. The declaration
of war was issued during the last week in April, and
before another week passed our fleets were in the
West Indies, Mantanzas had been bombarded and a
blockade established at Havana, while Dewey had
made his attack upon Manila and destroyed the Span
ish fleet in the Orient. The volunteer army was being
rapidly enrolled and the regular force massed at
points from which it could make a descerfr*rfpon the
enemy at the first opportunity.
This record has not been surpassed in modern
wars even by European nations, which are at all
times prepared for war. In the contest between
France and Germany the declaration of war was is
sued July 15, 1870, but, near as the combatants were
to each other and already armed as both of them
were, the first battle did not occur until August, and
peace was not made until May, 1871. The war be
tween Turkey and Russia began in April, 1877, but
it was near the end of July before the Russians
crossed the Danube. The British hostilities against
Egypt in 1882 began in June, but it was not until
July that her fleet bombarded Alexandria, and not
until the middle of September that her army of oc
cupation advanced to give battle to the enemy.
Since the great nations of Europe, whose armies
and navies are supposed to be at all time ready for
immediate battle, have required so much time to
make the attack after the declaration of war, it is
clear that our achievements have been remarkable for
promptness rather than for delay. The work already
done is, therefore, a sure promise of vigorous ac
tion from this time on. We are moving upon the
Spanish lines on both sides of the globe, and the de
mand is for unconditional surrender.
The Spanish authorities evidently intend to pro
long the war as much as possible. Neither their
troops nor their fleets are taking any risks. They
have hidden themselves as securely as possible be
hind fortifications and are leaving us to take the
initiative and do the fighting. Even by continuing
in these tactics, however, it is doubtful if they can
hold out much longer. It is significant that many of
their troops in Cuba instead of fighting desperately
against the small American forces landed near their
entrenchments have either run away or deserted. The
heart of the Spaniard is not in this fight. He will
quit as soon as he can, and perhaps his Goevrnment
will imitate the example.
At any rate the war. whether long or short, will
not seriously disturb our business, though it will en
tail heavy taxation and add to the public debt. The
great masses of our people will go on with trade
and industry as if there were no war. Spain is vir
tually whipped already, and we have provided the
means to defray the cost of the whipping, so whether
she yields to the inevitable this summer or next fall
makes but little difference.
THE PEKING SPY.
THAT there has come a report of a spy on
board the Peking having tried to blow up the
ship carrying a thousand men does not, hap
pily, indicate that any such approach to tragedy has
taken place. It does, however, suggest a dire pos
sibility.
The Spanish are brave even when bravery is
folly; spectacular, but useless. They make much of
a quality they term "honor." Just what elements
enter into the composition of this quality people not
of the Latin race do not fully grasp. But from what
can be learned of it it might include the operation
of enlisting for the purpose of wreaking destruction
upon the army whose cause oath had been taken to
defend. From the standpoint of the stickler for
honor of the Castilian brand, the traitor who would
sink a shipload of soldiers at the risk of going down
with it would cover his name with glory.
That some Spaniard shall yet make the attempt
is not beyond easy belief. It would mean nothing
worse than death, and this soldiers face in many
forms. When Hobson went into Santiago harbor
his chance of escape seemed as slender as that of
one of a regiment on board a scuttled and riven
transport on the high seas. Ragley on the deck of
the Winslow faced certain death, and, coming, it
found him smiling at his place. We regard Hobson
as a hero. To Bagley we give the tribute clue a
martyr, and on his grave the hands of the nation
would strew flowers. These men acted in accord
with the American notion of honor. The Spanish
notion is so different that for it to lead to some hor
ror such as the perpetration of an act like that said
to have been essayed on the Peking is far within the
botnds of credibility.
THE ESSENCE OF TREASON.
PROFESSOR NORTON, lately of Harvard, in
his recent speech was guilty of the double crime
of foolishness and an unpatriotism near to trea
son. In a country in which there was not permitted
full freedom of speech he would have been deemed
worthy a place in a dungeon.
This country has enemies. Some of the powers of
Europe would be glad to see it crushed. Spain is
open in expression of dislike. Such foes can be met.
But a deadlier enemy than any from without is the
Norton, mouthing his dispraise of American man
hood, of American methods, declaring us to be en
gaged in an unholy and barbaric war, and urging the
young men who come under his influence not to
enlist, but to reserve themselves "for the patriotic
labors of peace." It is nothing to him that the peace
must be won by the blood of valor, that the flag must
be upheld. He would have those who bask within
the light of his intelligence calmly wait until the end
had been accomplished and then come forward to
share the fruits springing from the battle-field.
Norton has not yet been charged with lunacy, but
if friends he has they should advance the plea of in
sanity in his behalf. Either the man is crazy or he
is a monster of selfishness. For a teacher to take the
stand that the administration has dragged the coun
try into a war for which there is no excuse and against
which all the better elements of society protested, is
for him to stamp himself not only as unfit to be a
guide and mentor, but unfit to mingle with men to
whom the honor of the country seems a thing to be
cherished. Norton would have a limited aristocracy,
composed of the superior, he being a sample of the
superior. God save any country which shall come
under the domination of such egregious poltroons.
Spanish soldiers who have to fight hungry may
console themselves that when a bullet strikes a full
stomach the owner of the stomach has no chance.
THE SAjST FRANCISCO CALL, IVIOWDAr, J:u'iwjri'-^zv,./jLbÂ»o.;;.
MISREPRESENTING THE RECORD.
AMONG the misrepresentations of fact by which
the Chronicle and the Record-Union evidently
believe they can deceive the people on the
Hawaiian annexation question is that of reiterating
the charge that Senator White was instructed by the
California Legislature to vote for annexation, and
that he is violating his duty to his constituency in
not doing so.
Even as stated by the annexation organs the charge
is not an effective one. It has long been established
by the precedents of many of the ablest statesmen
who have served in the Senate that the duty of a
Senator is not due primarily to his State, but to the
whole Union, and that this duty is to be performed
in accordance with conscience and the eternal prin
ciples of right rather than of the resolutions of legis
latures. That point, however, may be waived in this
instance. Even if we concede that a Senator is
bound by the declarations of the Legislature of his
State and that he must change his policy in the Sen
ate whenever the political majority in the Legislature
changes, there would still remain a full justification
for the course pursued by Senator White. That jus
tification lies in the fact that while one Legislature
adopted resolutions favoring annexation a later Leg
islature defeated such resolutions.
The Chronicle and the Record-Union falsify the
record and distort a half-truth into a whole lie by
ignoring the fact that the last utterance of a Califor
nia Legislature on the subject of annexation was a
defeat of a resolution in its favor. By the Legisla
ture of 1893 a resolution was hurriedly passed favor
ing the scheme. At that time the subject was not
fully understood. The Legislature of 1895, when the
issue was better comprehended, rejected a similar
resolution. The vote on the issue in the State Sen
ate stood twenty-two against and but nine in its
favor. A majority so overwhelming showed the
genuine sentiment of the people of California.
If a Senator is to be bound by the Legislature of
his State he must of course follow the latest dictates
of the Legislature upon any particular issue. What
may have been done by a bygone set of legislators
is of course overruled by an adverse action taken by
a later Legislature on the same subject. The charge
of the annexation organs in this instance, therefore,
is one of gross misrepresentation and has been so
often repeated as to lead to the conclusion that the
organs regard it as a lie cunning enough to do damage
to others besides themselves if they stick to it.
THE EXAMINER'S FOOL PICTURES.
A CORRESPONDENT whose discriminating
taste does not prevent him from amusing him
self with the absurdities of yellow journalism
when he has nothing else to do, sends us a critical
dissertation on the pictures printed in the Examiner
yesterday, and some of his comments are worth pub
lishing in order that the general public may share in
the amusement caused by the ridiculous feats of the
yellow artists.
Referring to the illustrations on page 3 he says:
"In one blue flaring picture we see a gunner wearing
trousers and with a pouch strapped to his waist hard
at work firing a gun in one direction while an officer
fully clothed is pointing in another. A companion
picture on the same page, and equally blue, shows a
number of sailors hoisting ammunition. These sail
ors, like the gunners in the first picture, are all duly
trousered; one of them has a sword and a revolver
strapped to his waist, while another has a sword in
his hand."
The pictures were designed to illustrate a story of
the battle of Manila purporting to be told by Gunner
Evans of the Boston. Now the writer, in describing
the maner in which the fleet prepared for action, says:
"Hatches were removed from the magazines and the
men stripped to the skin, wearing only their shoes.
The only way you could distinguish an officer was
from the shoes he wore." Our correspondent very
justly says, "The marine artist should have read the
story before he drew the pictures."
Continuing his dissertation the critic says: "Further
on there is a tragic story of battle by Ambrose
Bierce. The field artist now gets in his deadly work,
for there is the usual corporal's guard fighting in all
postures, and of course the usual officer pointing out
the enemy with a sword as if the men could not see
them well enough."
In this case it is probable our correspondent is
unjust to the field artist, for it is well known that
Mr. Bierce is himself a critic of pictures and no doubt
directs how his stories shall be illustrated. The art
ists of the yellow journal must not be held respon
sible for every silly thing in art which appears in the
paper.
GERMANY'S ASSUMPTION.
SO persistent are the reports of Germany's in
tent to settle the future of the Philippines as to
rather outnumber the denir.'-. While there
exists no probability that there is to be an attempt at
actual interference, the rumors are definite enough to
show that Germany would interfere did it but dare.
There can be no harm in being frank about this
matter. What the future of the islands is to be is
hidden in the book of fate, yet sealed to mortal ken.
But whether the territory wrested from the bloody
hands of the Spaniards be retained, given indepen
dence, turned over to another power or revert to a
chastened and contrite Spain, the verdict will be
given by the United States Government; none other.
Germany's wishes will not even be considered. Her
expression of desire to have them considered is a
distinct impertinence.
The fact may have been noticed that the blood of
this nation is up. The soldiers of the republic by
land and sea uphold the flag, offer their lives to the
sustaining of its honor, and while no selfish motive
impelled them to hasten to answer the call of the
President, they are not fighting and dying and suffer
ing that the result of their victory shall go to fatten
the ribs of an alien people. On this point the Amer
icans are a unit. Here and there arises a Love or a
Norton to bray dissent, but these creatures do not
count. They are not Americans; they are without
a country.
An Illinois volunteer went 1500 miles for the pur
pose of killing a woman, sh6t her three times and
beyond making her hysterical did no particular harm.
The country does not need such fellows for soldiers.
The offender should be turned over to the military
authorities. They would probably send him to prison
for a longer term than the civil courts would im
pose.
There would appear to be danger that this insur
gent chap at Manila may get into his $25,000 head an
idea that he is a bigger man than our Dewey.
Writers of anonymous letters might as well grasp
the fact that there is positively no limit to the capacity
and willingness of a waste-basket.
Spanish torpedoes are so uniformly worthless that
a suspicion may ultimately arise that somebody else
blew up the Maine.
COMET OBSERVERS AND THEIR DISCOVERIES.
BY PROFESSOR JAMES G. KEELER.
The last week has been an active one
for comet observers, particularly for
those on Mount Hamilton. On the night
of June 11, Mr. E. F. Coddington, fellow at
the observatory, discovered a comet by
photography. It made a short trail on a
plate which he had exposed In the Crocker
telescope, to the nebulous region sur
rounding the bright star Antares, In thÂ«
constellation Scorpio, and this trail at
tracted his attention when the plate was
developed. A larger telescope, turned to
the same part of the sky, showed that
the object which had left the trail was a
comet, moving slowly toward the south
west. It has since been observed every
night.
On the same evening Mr. John Tebbutt.
an able amateur observer in Australia,
discovered the periodic comet of Encke on
its return toward the sun. This Is a very
famous comet In the history of astronomy,
although it is always faint and insignifi
cant in appearance.
Mr. Perrine of the Lick Observatory
added another to his long list of cometary
discoveries on the night of June 14. The
comet which he found is about as bright
as a tenth magnitude star. No tall is yei
visible. It is at present constantly above
the horizon, but is too low to be well seen,
except for a short time before sunrise.
The "elements" of this comet have al
ready been computed by Mr. Perrine ana
Mr. Aitken from the Mount Hamilton
observations, but they would mean little
to most readers. They show that the least
distance of the comet from the sun, on
August 17, will be about three-quarters
that of the earth. Its path is east and
south, through the constellation Camelo
pardalis and the northern portion of Au
riga.
The orbit of this comet resembles some
what that of Perrine's comet of March
20, which is still visible, and both hayÂ»
some resemblance to the orbits of the
comets of lfiS4 and 1755.
The comet of March 20, referred to
above, is now known to be periodic. The
preliminary computations show that It
will return in about 305 years, but tho
final computations may change these fig
ures considerably.
At about 3 o'clock on the morning of
June 17 Professor Hussey discovered

EDITORIAL VIEWS OF THE WAR,
THE war has lasted long enough to prove that the President, in spite
of his reputation for amiability, is a man of strong purpose, con
servative by nature, yet one who acts with decision when convinced
that the right moment has arrived. He follows a higher law than
that based on the arts of popularity and demonstrative jingoism. In
refusing to recognize the Cuban insurgents as an independent government
he displayed a wisdom that is no longer questioned. He has taken bold
measures to preserve the fruits of Dewey's victory, though it opens up new
questions of national policy. He is a firm advocate of the annexation of
Hawaii, and reveals in that the high American spirit looking to the future
for the commercial security and development of the country. In Cuba,
where every reconnotsance is heralded as a repulse by the Spanish Cabinet,
care has been taken not to bring about a real repulse by precipitate orders.
The United States in this crisis is fortunate in its President. McKinley is
a man of solidity, of character, of principle, of prudence, and he is a true
representative of American progress. Under his earnest, thoughtful, single
minded leadership and pure patriotism no serious mistake will be made by
the United States in its conflict with Spain.â St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
COMMERCE TO RESULT.
There will be many trans-Pacific lines from this continent to Manila
lines of steam vessels and lines of sailing shipsâ when American control
and influence are fully established In the Philippine Islands. "We doubt
whether it is generally known, however, that there was an American line
to Manila long ago, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in the days
of the great Spanish galleons, when Mexico was New Spain, and much of
the wealth of the East Indies found its way to Europe through the Mexican
port of Acapulco on the Pacific. In the history of the Philippine group
there is no more interesting chapter than that relating to the infamous voy
ages of the richly laden galleons of Spain between Manila and Acapulco.
The voyages of the galleons ceased in ISIS with the departure of the last
one from Acapulco. A commerce equal to theirs in their best days, and far
surpassing it, may yet arise between the Philippine Islands and America,
when vessels bound eastward from Manila will not turn to the south upon
sighting the coast of California, but will steam straight in through the
Golden Gate.â New York Sun.
EUROPE WILL LEARN MUCH.
The fact that English, German and French papers have sent corre
spondents, or at least representatives, into the field with the American
troops, and that most of these are fair-minded, is encouraging. They will
inform Europe as to a good many points that have hitherto received very
little attention. The genuine army correspondent will write of men and
events much as the great war correspondents wrote of the battles of our
Civil War and of the Franco-Prussian War. There will be in the field
hundreds who never will become war correspondents, with comprehension
of military movements or appreciation of fighting qualities and courage.
But the people will soon learn which correspondents have a capacity
rightly to describe strategic or other movements in the field. Ihe corre
spondents from Europe are men who have been in the habit of writing
about English or German or French armies, and we may expect some little
show of^rejudice, but in the end the Instincts of the war correspondent
will compel recognition of generalship and soldierly quality.â Chicago Inter
Ocean.
RECORDS AND PENSIONS.
Costly experience gained by the War and Navy departments during the
Civil War has led to the cusation at Washington of what is probably the
most elaborate system of records of military and naval service ever estab
lished by any nation in the world. Although the current war will unques
tionably add largely to the pension list, it will be impossible to renew at
any future time the multiform and scandalous devices by which persons
not entitled to Government bounty have been borne upon the pension roll.
Our enormously exaggerated list of pensioners of the Civil War, which
shows no signs of decreasing from year to year, denotes and embodies an
error into which the Government could not fan a second time. There is not
the slightest apprehension at this time in the Record and Pension Division
of the War Dei artment that any improper or unjust claims will get
through the Pension Office on account of military operations in the war
with Spain. As to the navy, the system of hospital records there is so
thorough that they practically constitute a complete history of every case
of illness or of injury to men while afloat. These are preserved in the Sur
geon General's office, and may be referred to there at any time.âPhiladel
phia Record.
THE SPANISH NIGHTMARE.
The act of Cuban invasion is an accomplished fact. Into the crevice cre
ated by a wedge of iron driven by the navy batteries, Sampson has pushed
a party of marines. Old Glory floats above Caimanera, on the bay of Guan
tanamo. Santiago, near-by, is closely invested, and all is in readiness for
the prompt landing of the army now en route by transport steamers from
Key West to Cuba. In other words, the contemplated junction of the army
with the navy is about to be accomplished, to complete upon land a work
so well begun by the water batteries, the thunder of the warships. Cuba
will now almost immediately be occupied by the soldiers of the Union, and
Spain's supremacy over the Queen of the Antilles â now but a drÂ«am will
become a nightmare.â Cincinnati Commercial Tribune.
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DESIRES.
The good people of this country may be sure that the President Is as
anxious as any man in the United States can be to make short and credit
able work. He has been a soldier, and knows better than most men of his
age what is necessary and possible, and infinitely better than the men who
had not opportunity to learn from experience thirty years or more ago.
Perfect characters are not as frequent in real life as in novels, but the
country has not yet found occasion to doubt the President's ability, even
in the handling of difficult and complicated questions, while no one has
doubted his sincerity and devoted patriotism. He means to do the best
thing possible for his country, all may be sure, and he has the benefit of
daily counsel with men of the largest experience and the highest ability in
the work to be done. In view of these facts, a great deal of patience is in
order. It lacks ten days of two months since war was declared. A great
deal has been accomplished for so short a time, and it is not yet alto
gether clear that more haste might not have made less speed. The President
does not need to be told that people are intensely anxious to see the great
powers and resources of the Nation developed and used with the least pos
sible delay, and he well knows how apt his countrymen are to grow impa
tient. But the management which sacrifices nothing and risks as little as
possible, and makes every step safe, sufficient and irrevocable, will In the
end command the confidence and approval of the Nation and the honor of
mankind.â New York Tribune.
'THE NEW NAVAL ACADEMY.
The complete rehabilitation of the Naval Academy at Annapolis being
assured by the Congressional appropriation of $1,000,000 to start operations*
âthe estimated expenditure is $6,ooo,oooâ work is to begun on the dredging
and the seawalls. The first structures to be undertaken are the armory, the
boathouse, and the power house. The scheme of rehabilitation Is compre
hensive. It alms at having all the academy buildings at such convenient
points that the prompt and efficient autonomy of the school for naval aspi
rants may be assured. Just now, with the naval arm of the nation first in
the public eye, and with its movements and fortunes the subject of Intense
public interest, the future of the American navy will be a matter of solicitude
for at least the next decade. With its increase and adaptation to the re
quirements of modern sea defense and aggressiveness comes the necessity
for the best equipped and best arranged school for those who in time will
in a greater or lesser degree be responsible for the doings of the United
States fleet. The naval school opened at Fort Severn in the fall of 1845
under the auspices of Secretary Bancroft and grew into an agglomeration of
buildings which are now out of date and iadequate, if they do not tend to
militate In not a, few ways against the success of the modern course of In
struction.âNew York Time*.

the popular idea of astronomcal work
than P do P any other of the 'operations of an
observatory. The comet seeker uses a
short telescope (known by the same name)
and he searches the sky until his Patience
is rewarded by discovery. His search is
not, however, made at random, but is con
ducted according to a system. He sweeps
his telescope over a part of the sky, cov
ering a narrow strip. If no "suspicious
object is found, he slightly changes the
direction of his telescope and makes an
other sweep, covering a strip of sky ad
joining the first, and so on until he has
covered the whole region he wishes to ex
amine. On the next night he chooses a
different region. The sky in the east be
fore sunrise is one of the likeliest Places
for new comets, partly because at that
hour the less enthusiastic observers are
apt to be in bed. , â _,
A comet when discovered is usually very
faint, for any strange bright object would
not easily have escaped the sharp eyes of
the comet hunters. Keenness of vision Is
not, however, a sufficient equipment^ for
this class of work. The sky is full of
small nebulae, which closely resemble
comets, and the observer must know
where these are situated and be able to
identify them with the nebulae recorded
in the catalogues. If an unrecorded ob
ject of this kind is found to be in motion
it is certain to be a comet.
The comet seeker, no matter how skill
ful he may be, is not rewarded by a dis
covery every night, and among the most
necessary qualifications for his pursuit
are patience and perseverance.

TO BE MADE A COLONEL
O OLONEL. PARK HENSHAW will
command the new regiment Cali-
VÂ»> fornia will give to the nation, and
Curtain Frank BeL. Carrington
will be lieutenant colonel.
That was the virtual decision of Gov
ernor Budd and Adjutant General Bar
rett last evening, though the matter
will not be definitely settled until Colo
nel Henshaw haa been consulted.
<U>vernor Budd came down from
Stockton yesterday and had a con
ference with General Barrett regarding
the formation of the new regiment. No
definite decision was reached, but it
was thought best to tender the colonel
cy to. ark Henshaw of Chico, and that
gentleman was telegraphed for. He
will arrive to-night or to-morrow morn-
Ing and if he accepts the commission
Captain Carrington will be second in
command; if lie should decline, which
is hardly probable, Carrington will be
Kiven the position.
Colonel Fred Burgin of the Gov
ernor's staff will in all probability be
appointed major of one of the battal
ions of the new organization. Colonel
Burgin expressed a desire some time
ago to command a battalion, and as he
is a clo^o friend of the Governor his
wi.Â«h is likely to be gratified
As to the makeup of the regiment,
that is to be decided upon to-morrow,
after the Governor has conferred with
â el Hensh.iw. But it is certain
that most if not all of the coin;-.
will be drawn from the Second and
Fifth Regiments of the National

other hand there arc more than enough
- In the two regiments named

â¢v. r, they are all clamoring for
active Bervice, and assert, with truth,
that if the Governor did not see lit to
\ ich any raw organization into
ther commands, he should give
company in the National Guard
ace to 'enlist before yielding to a
aspirants for military glory who
in time <>f peace did not consider it
Worth whHe to help keep up the guard.
Another and a weighty reason that
inclines the Governor and his advisers
to the selection .if none but National
Guard companies is the matter of
equipment. Plenty of time will be
given for the formation of the new regi
ment, and by selecting six companies
from each of the two State commands
and distributing the uniforms and arms
among them, a perfectly equipped regi
ment can be turned over to the Govern
ment. This would reflect great credit
to the State, in view of the fact that
California has already placed three
fairly equipped regiments in the field,
while so-me States have sent their vol
unteers out without one man in four
kjjelng provided with so much as a cam
: hat.
The two regiments have recently been
{.-sued nev- vinl/orms, which, with the
of the old, will provide every mem
.ith a better outnt than the Gov
< rnment contractors are turning out
these days.
There are many minor details to be
arranged yet, which Governor Budd
will thoroughly canvass before deciding
upon.. After he selects the favored
companies it will be determined
whether to rendezvous them in this
city for- examination or send the sur
geons to the different localities.
Captain Carrington reported last
night that he had about concluded his
. of mustering in. recruits for the
aad Beventh Regiments. Only
fifty men are required to bring the for
mer up to its maximum strength, and
the captain expects to finish with them
to-day. He says that some of the men
who signed the roll are slow in report
ing for examination, aitho-ugh they

do not report at the Page-street armory
by 9 o'clock this morning Captain Cam

ASTOR ARTILLERY
AT OAKLAND MOLE
The New York Millionaire's
Light Battery Eager for
the Fray.
mAKLAXD, June 19. â The Astor
l.iKht Artillery arrived to-night, six
days out from New York city, with all
veil and eager to sail for Manila.
Peyton C. March, late of the Fifth
.Artillery, is captain. Captain March
is a warm personal friend of Mr. Astor,
and it was at his solicitation March
was put in command. Second Lieuten
ant Koehler and Second Lieutenant
Williams, late of the Sixth Artillery,
are first and second lieutenants re
spectively. Among the non-commie
t-ioned officers are Sergeant Crimmins,
late of the Fifth Artillery, U. S. A.;
ant Burton Holmes, who has seen
c service in the British army in
India and Africa; Sergeant Young, a
member of the famous Young family of
Halt Lake city and identified with the
Mormon settlement of Utah; Sergeant
Sillmun, of late a commander of a bat
; stationed at Detroit, Mich.
All commissioned and non-commis
sioned officers are mo-unted.
Among the vocations and professions
represented are eight lawyers, several
doctors, the late superintendent of the
Presbyterian Hospital, New York city,
a United States marshal from Texas,
a barber from the West and over half
a dozen boys whose fathers rank high
on the list of United States million
aires. Private Dan Prybis is worth
$1,000,000 In his own name.
Mr. Astor has been most generous in
giving orders for the personal equip
ment of the men. ILacn man received
two uniforms, one the blue cloth
of light weight of the regular ar
tllleiy, a brown campaign hat, brown
canvas leggins and gauntlsts. The
other uniform Is brown canvas stuff,
known as Kakl cloth, trimmed in scar
let, pockets and shoulder straps in
cluded. The outfit further includes
three suits of under clothing, three
blue woolen shirts, six pairs of Â«ocks,
three pairs of canvas leggins, two
pairs of tramping shoes, six handker
chiefs and a pajr of buckskin gauntlet
gloves. The men enter for three years'
service and receive (15 60 a mouth. A,
rumor has it that the day the battery
moved each man received $100 in gold.
The field equipment includes twenty
horses and one hundred mules and six
Hotchklss rapid-firing guns. The guns
are known as three-Inch mountain
guns, throwing a twelve-pound shell.
These guns are a very powerful little
weapon, especially designed for moun
tain service.
The horses and mules, which were
purchased at St. Louis and were at
tached to the train, were cut off and
left when word came that General Mer
ritt would not transport them. In case
they are allowed to take them they
will be hurried on West.
SUNDAY AT THE CAMP.
Attorney General and Mrs.
Fitzgerald Dined by Brig
adier General Otis.
Yesterday was beyond doubt one of the
most disagreeable days that the soldiers
at Camp Merritt have been subjected to.
A strong wind, that in its velocity
amounted almost to a hurricane, blew
clouds of dust and sand over everybody
and everything. Despite this discomfort
the usual Sunday crowd visited thrf 1
camp, saw the same sights, asked the
same questions, and appeared to find the
same pleasure they experienced on for
mer visits.
The Seventh California has borne its
disappointment over not going on the
;â â¢ xt expedition In true soldierly fashion,
and. while the officers and men feel blue
matter, they are not complain
ing. It ia an ill wind that blows nobody
good, and the men wore made happy yes
terday by an order received from bri
gade "headquarters announcing that the
regiment will be paid at lv o'clock this
morning. _

CHAPMAN WILL RECOVER.
Lieutenant Conrad's Conduct
Will Be Thoroughly In
vestigated by a Board.
Private Harry Chapman of Company
H of the South Dakota Volun
teers, who on Saturday suffered
severe injuries at the hands of Lieutenant
Conrad of the First Montana*, Is on the
high road to recovery. His injuries proved
to be not so serious as at first reported
by the surgeons.
Nevertheless there is being made by
Captain Englesby ol Chapman's regiment
a thorough investigation of the trouble
that led up to the disastrous assault and
of Lieutenant Conrad's conduct.
Conrad was formerly an officer of Com
pany M, but It is said he made himself
highly unpopular with every man of his
company and was transferred to Com
pany H, his present command.
Conrad, beside* being a man of high
temper, is considered by his men a mili
tary martinet of the most offensive type;
he is no better loved by his present com
pany than by his last.
The consensus of opinion among the
men of the Montanas is that the order
of things In the recent row should have
been reversed.
If the investigation now pending uncov
ers sufficient evidence to Warrant it, an
official hearing will undoubtedly result.
TROOPS DISSATISFIED.
Washington Volunteers Want
a Fair Show, Even if a New-
Colonel Is Necessary.
The Washington Volunteers have been
at a loss to know why they have been
overlooked in the assignment of troops
for Manila, and are considerably worked
up over an alleged explanation given In
a Seattle dispatch, which states that no
opportunity will be given them to do bat
tle with the Spaniards. The dispatch
states that "Colonel WJiolley's elevation
from a second lieutenancy in a colored
company to the command of the Wash
ington troops has so embittered the men
who formerly served with him at Van
couver in the Fourteenth Infantry that
they have leagued themselves against the
Washington volunteers and have sufficient
influence to prevent them from going to
the Philippines."
Colonel Wholley was appointed from the
regulars by Governor Rogers. Some or
the Washington officers at Fontana bar
racks are much agitated over the situa
tion and think it unfair to punish a whole
reeiment on account of Colonel W holley.
â¢J..t them call Wholley off and give us
a chance under some one else, said a
prominent officer last evening. "\\ c had
nothing to do with Wholley s appoint
ment."
WITH MILITARY HONORS.
Private Frazer of South Dakota
Buried in the Cemetery
at the Presidio.
Samuel Frazer, a private of Company L,
First South Dakota, died early yesterday
morning from spinal meningitis. The

honor to their dead comrade.

ILLEGAL FISHING PLEASES THE SOLDIERS.
Over Two Tons of Striped Bass Seized and Sent to Camp Merritt,
fluch to the Fishermen's Disgust.
The following posted in a conspicuous place on Fisherman's Wharf attracted quite a crowd of people
yesterday morning. All who read it enjoyed the joke, but some of the fishermen, who failed to see where
the fun came in, tore the notice down during the afternoon:
Whereas, Certain Italian, Greek or Slavonian fishermen caught in the waters of the Sacramento River a large
quantity of striped bass, a most delectable article of food; ar.d
Whereas, The fish were less than th-ee pounds each in weight, the minimum prescribed by law (in fact they each
weighed less than a pound), and were in consequence seized by a Deputy Fish Commissioner; and
Whereas, The ladies of the Red Cross Society (may their shadows never grow less), hearing that this large con
signment of the King of Fish waa going begging for want of an owner, did secure the same by paying the express
charges; and
Whereas, The said ladies of the Red Cross Society cent the said large consignment of striped bass to Camp
Merritt to serve as an appetizing breakfast for the soldiers. Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the thanks of the entire camp are extended to the ladles of the Red Cross Society, andâ also
to the men who caught the fish.
Do it again fishermen. THE BOYS IN BLUE.
The event which brought forth the above effusion from "The Boys in Blue," and which brought joy into
Camp Merritt, caused weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth in the fishermen's camp on the banks of the
Sacramento. Last Saturday one of the liver steamers brought down from some point cm the river twenty-six
boxes of- fish. The tag showed that one Antone Petrick was the shipper, and that the goods were consigned
to A. Paladini, the Union Fish Company and others.
Fish Warden "Joe" Mogan has been on the watch for consignments of striped bass weighing less than
three pounds, so he overhauled Petrick's shipment. The twenty-six boxes contained five thousand two hun
dred pounds of young striped bass, not one of which weighed a pound. Mogan said nothing and sat down to
watch the boxes. They were taken away by Wells-Fargo's Express wagons, but when the driver asked
Paladini and the Union Fish Company to receive the goods and pay the charges they refused, on the
ground that it was illegal to have in their possession striped bass weighing less than three 'pounds.
The fish were accordingly taken back to the water front, and at one time it looked as though they
would have to be destroyed, and that the carriers would be out their charges. The ladies o-f the Red Cross,
who are attending to the wants of the soldier boys when they arrive at the ferries, heard of the fish and of
fered to pay the charges if they might have them. Wells, Fargo & Co. were only too glad to close with the
offer, so the money was paid and the fish sent out to Camp Merritt.

Camp Merritt Notes.
Dr. Titus of this city has been added to
the corps of surgeons on duty at the field
hospital.
The First Battalion of the First North
Dakota was at the rifle butts yesterday
morning In a body. Notwithstanding the
heavy wind blowing some excellent scores
were made.
Vaccination seems to be going hard with
a great number of ths boys. Yesterday
nine out of sixteen buglers were too ill to
turn out. Nearly every man in camp is
milking things just as easy as he can for
that arm and is hoping that the word to
go aboard ship will not come until his
troubles are over.

Communion service was held yesterday
morning and was largely attended. There
is a large percentage of church-going men
among the South Dakotas and the regi
mental chaplain never lacks a congrega

General Merritt at the Orpheum.
While the large audience was more than
willing to admit that there was general
merit in the Orpheum representation last
night, its verdict was conclusively proved
by the appearance in a front seat of the
Chief of the Expeditionary Forces to Ma
nila. When General Wesley Merritt en
tered the band struck up a patriotic strain
ar.d the people arose and cheered the com
mander to the echo. The major general
gracefully acknowledged the tribute.

CHRIS LARSEN'S BATH.
A Picnicker Who Liked to Swim in
the Cold Bay Waters.
The thirty-ninth annual picnic of the
Scandinavian Society was held yesterday
at Shell Mound Park, and the attendance
was fair. The time was passed pleasantly
dancing and indulging in the games pre
pared by the committee. In tne pro
gramme of times, races, etc.. there were
fourteen events and prizes by the dozen
for the winners. The following had
charge of the outing:
Committee of arrangement â Charles A.
Anderson f chairman), Ellas Ruud (sec
retary), Charles J. E. Spillum (treasurer),
Charles Johnson, Charles Olsen. Flooi
manager, Charles Johnson.
Chris Larsen, one of the picnickers on
the trip home across the bay, and while
hilarious through the influence of stimu
lants, informed his friends that he was
about to take a bath, and before they
could stop him he sprang on the rail of
the steamer and plunged into the water.
A boat was lowered and the man was
taken from the water without much diffi
culty. He had hardly regained his lib
erty on the deck of the ferry when he
rushed again to the rail and a second
time he was floundering in the water.
He could swim like a fish, and when the
rescuing boat reached him the second
time he was paddling about in the waves
and singing a patriotic Scandinavian
song. After the second bath Larsen was
tied and nailed down to the deck of me
ferry-boat until land was reached.
STRECKER'S KEEN EYE.
The Expert Rifleman Makes an Ex
ceptional Score at Schuetzen
Park.
A. Strecker of the California Schuetzen
Club stands crowned to-day as not only
the king of that club's monthly bullseye
cash prize shoot, but in a friendly contest
with E. TV. McLaughlin he was the victor
by 18 points, though laboring under a han
dicap of 20 points. Andrew, Charles Ander
son's youngster, proved too powerful a
mascot for the forces of shootwide to con
quer.
In this shoot only one bullseye waa
counted, and the one making the smallest
score proved the happiest rifleman. A
large number shot, the principal scores
being as follows: <
A. Strecker, score, 177; F. E. Mason, 179;
A. Gehret, 228; Philo Jaioby, 304; C. J.

L. Reubold Jr., 2ft75.
In his competitive shoot with McLaugh
lin, Strecker's score was 457, and his op
ponent's 476.
The stand of the San Francisco Turner
Schuetzen waa also filled during the day
by a number of riflemen. Captain Fred
Attinger carried off the medal with a
score of 312 points. In order came the
following contestants: John Utschig Sr.,
C. Eging, L. Brunne, Joe Straub, A.
Utschig, Joe Gossner, L. Langer, Otto
Burmeister, Charles Sagehorn.
In the Verein Eintracht shooting con
test H. Gumbel proved the winner, with
F. Vinner a good second. A windy day
prevented as good scores being made as
would probably have been made other-
MRS. SEYMOUR'S DENIAL.
Didn't Threaten to Kill Her Husband
and Never Had a Quarrel With.
Him.
"Did I threaten to kill my husband?
No, neve.r!"
Bo said Mrs, S. H. Seymour last evening
In her apartments at the Baldwin Hotel
when asked if she had any statement to
make In regard to the published an
nouncement that Mr. Seymour had de
cided to institute divorce proceedings.
"I was very much surprised upon read
ing the article in The Call," said she.
However, she did not seem very much dis
turbed over the publication, and had evi
dently recovered from the effects of the
shock. "I have been holding a levee all
day," she continued, "answering the ques
tions of sympathizing callers. There is no
truth In the publication. I don't believe
Seymour ever said what he is credited
with saying in that Los Angeles dispatch.
He will be here Monday evening, and then
I'll rind out. I got a letter from him on
the 15th. We never had a quarrel since
we were married nineteen years ago. I
have no grounds for divorce and I know
he hasn't. People have been trying to
separate us for years. About four years
ago they had us separated in a weekly
paper. We are still together, and there
is no more truth in the present story than
there was in the other one. It may be
possible that this rumor started from a
divorce case brought by another man of
the same name as that of my husband. It
may be a case of mistaken identity."
SCIENTISTS ARE IGNORED.
Professor Winston Sets Aside the
Theories of the Masters.
Professor William Windsor lectured at
Metropolitan Temple last night on "The
Sun." He had a good audience, and hia
address was illustrated copiously with,
photo-opticon views.
The professor is quite dogmatic In his
views. He set forth that all scientists are
wrong in their theories of the sun's heat.
"It is not caused by gases or by heat on
the sun," said the lecturer, "but by elec
tricity, which generates no heat until It
strikes the atmosphere of the plajiets.
Beyond our atmosphere there is neither
heat nor light, which shows that my
theory is true. Let me tell you, also, that
all the scientists are wrong regarding tho
cause of meteors and the danger from
comets. There never was a comet that
has struck this earth and there will nevei
be such a thing happen, for the reason
that the magnetism of the earth will re
pel all such dangers."
In a like way the professor differed from
the views of all astronomers, mental phil
osophers and physicist in the realm of
chemistry, physics and general science.
To Serve Life Sentence.
Theodore Park Haynes, the murderer of
Lieutenant Burke, and Joseph Theron,
convicted of burglary, were transferred to
Folsom Prison yesterday afternoon. Both
men are to serve life sentences. They
were taken to the prison by Deputy Sher
iffs Degan and Appel.

A LARGE FLEET OF SUGAR
BOATS FROM HAWAII.
All of Them Made Long Voyages Ow
ing to Being Carried to the
Westward in Light Winds
and Calnis.
There was not much work done on the
transports yesterday. The Morgan City
received her complement of coal from the
Centennial and was moved to Paciilc
street wharf, where she now keeps the
Indiana company. The latter vessel was
being couied from lighters yesterday, as
was also the Ohio. The City of Para haa
had her bulkheads torn out and the work
of putting in the bunks has begun. On
the Valencia little has been done as yet,
but tht; chances are that she will begin
coaling to-day. Carpenters will be at
work on the entire fleet to-day, and an
effort will be made to have them all
ready to sail the latter part of the week.
The work of coaling the steamer Nero
from the R.ihnne went on yesterday. The
big collier will take all the ship hns In
her hold and about 1000 tons more out of
one vi the vessels that pot in yesterday.
Two of the coal cargoes have be<->n bought
by the Government, and the vessels will
go to Mare Island to discharge.
The navy -yard tug Cnadllla came down
yesterday and towed the Iroquois (ex-
Fearless) from the I'nion Iron Works up
to the island. The Iroquois' armament
has arrived from the East, and as soon
:â¢:- it baa been placed in position the ves
sel will go into commission. It has been
rumored that the Iroquois will go to Ma
nila to relieve the Mei'ullough as a dis
patch boat.
There is a chance that the next fleet
to get away with troops may consist of
six vessels. The Mail Company's steam
er Newport, which arrived from Panama
and way ports last Saturday, will be re
leased from quarantine to-day. If Uncle
Sam presses her Into service she could
be discharged in quick time, as she has
a small cargo aboard. It would not take
long to fit her out, and she would thus
be able to sail with the others the latter
part of tha week.
The next lleet to get away will prob
ably consist of the City of Puebla, due
lure on the ZLst mat. from Puget Sound:
the Peru, due on the 24th inst. from
Hongkong; the Alameda, due here from
Australia, and the Acapulco, now on the
way from Panama and due on the 29th
inst. They will be pressed into the str
vice if necessary. To those may be added
the Northrn Pacific Company's steamers
Victoria and Olympia, now at Seattle.
Both these vessels have been granted an
American registry, and are therefore
available as troop-ships. Combined, this
fleet will accommodate all the troops that
will be left at the camp, so thai ships
will only then be required for further
drafts of soldiers.
An unusually large fleet of sugar boats
got in from Hawaii yesterday. All of
them wr-re caried to the westward, in fact
Captain Williams of the brig \V. G. Irwin
said he had never been so far west be
fore in any trip he has made from Hon
olulu.
The schooner King Cyrus brought up
21,483 sacks sugar from Honolulu in 23
days; the schooner Metha Nelson. 11,500
Backs of sugar from Kahului in 2S days;
the bark Santiago, 26,700 sacks. in IS days
from Hilo; the brie: W G Irwln, 8754 sacks
of sugar and 99 barrels of molasses from
Honolulu in 17V, days; the schooner Car
rier Dove. 22,401 sacks, from Honolulu in
29 days. The other vessels made runs as
follows: The bark Mauna Ala, 22 days
from Honolulu, the barkentine Irmgard,
18 days from Honolulu; the schooner Es
ther Buhne. 24 days from Honolulu, and
the schooners Albert Meyer, 20 days, and
Olga, 19 days, from Kahului.
Beside the sugar fleet a number of deep
â water vessels came in. The British ship
Belford arrived from Newcastle, N. S. W.,
with 2050 tons of coal after a passage of
M days. The Lucipara made the run
from the same port in 77 days, while the
Drumblalr made it in 72 days. The
schooler LÂ»izzie Vance was 89 days com
ing from Newcastle, N. S. W., being ob
liged on the way to put into Honolulu for
provisions. After leaving Newcastle one
of the chronometers of the schooner got
out of time, and Captain Hardwick had
to guess at which one it was. Then dur
ing a gale the mainsail was blown away,
and these accidents coupled with the
shortness of provisions made the Vance's
run a memorable one.
Another arrival yesterday was the Brit
ish bark Aukigirth, et> days from Pisagua,
with nitrate for the California Powder
"Works.
A BULLET ENDS A
WRECKED LIFE
W. THIEDEMANN'S BODY FOUND
ON THE OCEAN BEACH.
An Uncontrollable Love for Drink
Brings Behrand Joost's Son-in-
Law to a Suicide's Grave.
The body of \.illiam Thiedemann was !
found by F. Sunkel, an employe of the j
Olympic Salt Water Company, on the
ocean beach early yesterday morning
near the Seal Rock House. The body lay
on the side of a sloping cliff with a bullet
hole in the right temple and a white
handled revolver lying beside it with two
empty shells in the cylinders. One of the
bullets had entered the man's brain, caus
ing instant death.
The reason given for Thiedemann tak
ing his life is that of family trouble, pro
duced by drink and dissipation. He was
married to the daughter of Behrand
Joost, the former owner of the San Ma
teo and San Francisco electric street ''ar
line. One child is lfft of the union, who,
with its mother, is residing in Martinez.
The deceased had been an inmate of the
German Hospital until last Wednesday.
When he JÂ«ef t that institution he safd hÂ«>
was about to secure employment at 519
Front street.
Previous to the breaking up of the fam
ily Thiedemann resided at 1724 Page
street and was at one time engaged in
the mercantile business with fair pros
pects of success until his dissipated hab
its brought him to ruin.
SEA CAPTAIN ROBBED.
Michael Barry and Another Man
Could Not Resist the Sight of
Gold.
Captain I>. Dower of the schooner Sa
rah through an injudicious display of his
coin was robbed by two men on Second
and Harrison streets yesterday morning.
One of the footpads was captured. Dower
had changed a $20 g-old piece in a barber's
shop, where he had been shaved, and af
ter leaving the shop he met Michael Bar
ry, a laborer, and another man. Barry
asked him for ten cents to got a "bracer,
and he pulled the change out of his pock
et. The sight of the gold was too much
lor Barry and he grabbed a $5 gold 4 piece
and ran. The other man also made a
grab and got about $9 60. Dower pursued
Barry and was joined by a crowd of small
Vnys. Policeman O'Connor saw the crowd
tad at Hryant street captured Barry.
O'Connor took Barry to the patrol box
after putting the handcuffs on one of his
wrists, and while they were standing
there waiting for the wagon Barry hit
Dower a terrific blow on the nose with his
disengaged fist. At the City Prison Bar
ry was booked on charges of robbery and
battery. The police know the other rob
ber and expect to soon have him under
arrest.
Beautiful and Impressive Ceremonies
A very beautiful service was held at 4
o'clock yesterday ufternoon a: the
Church of the Star of the Sea, when Arch
bishop Riordan confirmed forty little chil
dren of the parish. Father P. J. Coyle rf
the parish assisted in the ceremonies,
which were simple yet beautiful.' The
bishop preached a Bpeclal sermon for the
children and at its conclusion invoked di
vino benediction upon the little, ones
There were also present Fathers McGln
ty. Mulligan. O'Ryan. Oottle and Clancy.
IT WAS TENNESSEE'S DAY.
Hundreds of Her Soldiers Enjoy a
Day at the Park, Cliff and
Baths.
O^-inff to the fierce wind that mnaned
yesterday through the trees ami fniiage
at the park and lashed the billows of the
sea into chilling spray at the Cliff House,
soldiers and citizens had considerable
trouble and experienced some disappoint
ment in the pursuit of pleasure. Not
withstanding the fact, however, that
many got more exorcise than was neces
sary to health chasing their headgear,
none complained. The programme at the
park was prepared for the purpose of re
kindling a spirit of patriotism in the
breasts of those in which it had died and
enthusing these In whose breasts its
light never goes out. Uncle Sam's boys
in blue were much In evidence, but Ten
nessee put more soldiers out skirmishing
for fun and recreation than almost all

Lady. I gave a handful of Ripans Tabules to an old gentleman of
Brooklyn, and he said their effect upon him has bees
most remarkable.
Friend. What was the matter with him, anyway ?
L. He is a weigher, and works about the wharves ;.â¢â ;(] ware-
houses. He said that always after eating he would be
troubled with gases, and there would be a sÂ»vsntion as
of a load on the pit of his stomach which : â â .!:? him
very uncomfortable.
F. Well, what good did the Ripans do him ?
L. I don't know how they did it, but he says they were effect-
ive from the start, and he was surprised to see how
quickly one would give him relief. I think it is quite
remarkable, for he is a confirmed dyspeptic and hÂ«
positively sneered when I gave him the Ripans. Ha
didn't seem to think anything could reach bis case.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 20, IS9B.

district. They were everywhere. When I
the band struck up "Dixie" at the Cliff
House a regular old-time Southern war
cry from the throats of a host of Ten
nessee's boys rent the air, but the cry ;
was drowned when "Marching Through
Georgia" sounded above the ocean's
beating on the shore. A hundred or two j
of the same regiment visited the Chutes
and enjoyed its various attractions.
Out at Sutro's Baths a great crowd |
gathered to witness the various features j
Ot the programme, and particularly the i
high diving. Volunteers from lowa, |
Washington and California contested for j
the prize. The soldiers climbed higher
anil higher, but finally all quit but
Winkler of Washington. He climbed
until the glass roof would admit of a no i
greater ascent, then soared out into the
air and completed a beautiful dive. Amid ;
great applause he was awarded the prize.

Changes That Have Been Made in the
Commissioned Officers of the

Quartermaster.
Another week has passed and there is*
no advancement In regard to re-estab
lishing the guard. The conference thai
Ice place between the
index-in -cbi eland the division com
mander did not result in anything defi
nite, as at the meeting it was announced
that Judge A<i\ , > -,- r of the divis
ion staff was preparing an opinion to
show that it became the duty of the au
thorities to discharge from the service of
t. State, honorably, all those members
cf the National Guard who, having vol
unteered, were mustered into the ser
viie of the United States.
A time for another conference was set.
but before that date Major General John
H. Dickinson received information of the
death in Oregon of his mother, and he
at once left the city to attend to the last
sad dutfe? which devolved upon him.
The decision of the Judge Advocate ha 3
not yet been made public, but it is un
derstood that it takes the stand that the
guard should be reorganized in order that
the State may not be without military
protectlon.
In General Orders No. 3 Governor Budd.
the commander-ln-chief, under date of
June 6, lias the following:
"General Dickinson will at once take
such steps as the preservation and pro-
Btate property of the regiments
I (First and Seventh Infantry) as
In his judgment may be necessary.
'"Ho is further directed as soon as these
regiments are accepted by the United
to immediately take suuh steps as
in hi< Judgment may be necessary to nil
up the maximum number of companies
of the National Guard, as there may be
nd call for volunteers."
This was approved May 3. So far noth
is beÂ«?n done to "till up the maxi
;:un:ber of companies," and in fact
â¢ S has been done further than to
c the applications of those who
be willing to serve as National
â¢Ju.iiusmen from colonel down.

Officers Killed at Their First
Trial.
ON BOARD THE DISPATCH BOAT !
DAUNTLESS, OFF SANTIAGO DE
CUBA, Saturday, June 18 (via King- 1
ston, Jamaica, June 19).â The horizon |
Is eagerly and Impatiently scanned for
a glimpse of the long-expected trans
ports. The delay in their arrival is in- j
explicable, as much favorable weather
is being lost and the hurricane season 1
is due in less than thirty days. Mean- !
while, from Kingston and Port Anto
nio come reports that large quantities j
of supplies are being smuggled into
Cuba.
Admiral Sampson is in daily commu
nication with the Cubans under Colonel
Cebraro, who are investing Santiago
on the land side and are continuously j
skirmishing with the Spanish outposts. |
General Linares now commands the j
military forces in the town, where there |
are 8000 regulars concentrated. The ;
civilians are ma starving condition, and |
their deplorable state will be more j
and more aggravated from day to day.
Spies report to Admiral Sampson that I
the Spanish general Joral and several j
officers were killed by the guncotten
explosion at the first trial of the bat
teries of the Vesuvius.

HONOR THE MEMORY
OF A DEAD FRIEND.
FIVE HUNDRED LADIES IN
MOURNFUL PROCESSION.
Impressive Services at the Funeral
of the Late Miss Grote of the
Young Ladies' Institute.
More than 800 young ladies, representing
the several branches of the Young Ladies'
Institute and one parlor of the Native
Daughters, marching in procession before
the hearse that conveyed the mortal re
mains of the late Miss Sophie A. Grote
to the home of the dead, was a novel sight
in this city, and it was the manner in
which those who were in the procession
manifested their respect and sympathy
for .her who in life had been their dearly
cherished friend and kindly advisor that
made the occasion memorable. Not only
were there these sincere mourners, but
there were hundreds from all classes who
called at the mortuary residence and at
tended the service in the Church of the
Holy Cross to pay their last tribute to the
memory of one who wl\\ be truly missed
from the wide circle in which she moved.
The funeral of Miss Grote took place
yesterday forenoon at half -past 10 o'clock
from the family residence at the corner
of Golden Gate avenue and Devisadero
street, and in the parlors of the house
there rested in a magnificent casket of
white embossed velvet, shrouded in white
and covered with hundreds of fragrant
rosebuds, white and pink, all that was
mortal of the beautiful young woman,
whose kindly nature, charitable disposi
tion and faculty for endearing herself to
all who knew her, won for her countless
numbers of true friends. At the foot of
the casket was a sheaf of wheat tied with
lilac ribbon, symbolizing that the grim
reaper, death, had again done nis work.
Around the face even. Deautiful after
weeks of illness, there was a peaceful ex
pression indicative of easy transit from
natural sleep to the rest tliat shall know
no Waking till the day of final judgment.
In her hair twined a single La France
rosebud, which was her favorite flower.
Around the parlors there was a large
number of most elegant works of floral
art, the unstinted evidence of love and af
fection for the one who had passed away.
The organization of which she was the
president contributed a large cross rep
resenting the emblem of the order, and at
its base was worked in violets "Our Grand
President." The Grand Council of the
Young Men's Institute offered two im
mense bunches of La France roses held
together with a tie of white silk; there
was a large heart and cross from S. L.
Waller and other members if the Board
of Education, a crescent and star from
Buena Vista Parlor, N. D. G. W., a large
cross of ivy from the council in Napa. a
dozen bunches of roses from the Durant
School," a contribution of most exquisite
flowers from the pupils Miss Grote taught
in the Golden Gate School, a vacant chair
from Truck Company No. 6, a broken
wheel from Branch No. 20, a floral chair
from the institute at Livermore. Others
Who sent flowers and floral pieces were;
The principal and teachers of Golden Gate
School, Edith Hund. J. D. and F. Sit-in.-,
Mr. ami Mrs. Wreden. John O. O'Donnell,
Mrs. M. M. Ryan, the Board of Education
and teachers of the public schools, W.

â iÃting of J. Hamilton of the Lincoln
School, J. Simmons of the Girls' High
School. Miss M. Nolan of the office of the
Board of Education, and Reginald Web
st.-r, superintendent of Schools. In addi
tion to flowers, Harriet M. Skklmore,
"Marie," sent a touching letter of sym
pathy, and a poem to the memory of "her
deceased friend, together with a floral of
fering.
There were In the parlors telegrams of
condolence from all parts of the State
and a message of sympathy from Madi
s>>n S. Babcock expressing his regret at
inability to attend, as the news of the
young lady's death had completely un
nerved him.
During the forenoon hundreds entered
the mortuary parlor to look at the face
of the dead, and there was .scarcely a
dozen of her sex who did not imprint a
farewell kiss upon her brow and then
kneel by the casket and offer up a silent
prayer. On the previous evening the
funeral service of the Young Ladies' In
stitute was read, and yesterday, just be
fore the time came for closing the casket
lid, the service for the dead of the Na
tive Daughters was given by Past Presi
dent Mrs. Genevieve Baker of Buena Vis
ta Parlor.
Tho pall-bearers â Samuel Hasklns,
grand president of the Y. M. 1., George
A. Stanley, the grand secretary, and D.
E. Hayden, grand director, representing 1
the Grand Council; E. J. O'Rourke. P.
L.awler and John A. Dunlevy, represent
ing the board of management and the
San Francisco councils of the Y. M. 1.,
and E. B. Thomas and Harry Pinkham,
grand directors, representing the ushers
at the churchâ tenderly lifted the casket
on which was laid the pale blue regalia
that was the emblem of Miss Grote's of
fice and transferred it to the hearse.
The funeral cortege, preceded by the la
dies of both organizations, wended its
way to Holy Cross Church, where solemn
h\ga mass was celebrated by Rev.
Father McGinty, assisted by Rev.
Fathers Coyle and Cummlngs. During
the impressive service in the presence
of more than Hght hundred people the
choir, composed of Mrs. Coursen Camp
bell, Miss Elena Roeckel, Paul Girard
and Arthur Boyle rendered Schmidt's
"Requiem" and Mrs. Coursen Campbell
sang Chopin's "Paradise." Mrs. E. (V.ur
sen Roeckel was the musical director.
Father McGinty preached the funeral
sermon, and in touching language told
the congregation of the beautiful life of
the young lady who had been honored
with positions of trust, and spoke of the
good work she had done, after which he
drew a pathetic lesson from the cutting
off of one so* young, who had every pros
pect of a bright and useful future.
At the close of the service the funeral
procession was formed again, with all
the grand officers of the Young Ladies'
Institute at the head, and proceeded to
Calvary Cemetery, where were spoken
the last words of the service of the
church.
Next Tuesday there will be a high
mass in St. Mary's Cathedral at 9 a. m.
for the repose of the soul of Miss Grote.
REWARDS AWAITING
SHAFTER'S OFFICERS
Major-Generalships That May Be
Won by Deeds or Valor at
Santiago.
NEW YORK, June 19.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Prompt and substantial recognition is
in store for officers in General Shafter's
army who may distinguish themselves
In battle at Santiago. President Me-
Kinley, I understand, is holding back
his most important army patronage as
an incentive for deeds of valor for offi
cers who have now gone to the field.
He still has eighteen major-gf>"rr a |.
ships at his disposal. Now that young
second lieutenants have been appointed
this is about all the patronage in the
way of army commissions he has left.
In appointing the remaining eighteen
major-generals the President will stick
very closely to the regular army.
There has been a great deal of
pressure brought to bear on be
half of veterans of the late war with
distinguished military- records, but the
President has concluded that genuine
efficiency and not sentiment must gov
ern in future selections; hence his de
cision to wait for results from the San
tiago expedition.
The President had Â« list of brigadier
generals in the regular army which he
expected to send in this week, but has
concluded to hold it oack for the rea
sons stated.
Major-General Miles, now that he has
decided to go to Porto Rico and subse
quently to Cuba in command of the In
vasion, is likely to eet the much-cov
eted lieutenant-generalcy.
I understand that the House Military-
Committee has decided unanimously to
report in favor of the immediate pass
age of the bill introduced b" Chairman
Hull, making Adjutant-General Corbin
a major-general. This Is to* be done
in order to give the head of the most
important staff corps of the army a
rank commensurate with the important
duties pertaining to it.

j into Netarts Bay on the Oregon coast

i citing story of mutiny is learned.
Monday, May fi, A. Fradgely, the freight
j clerk, presented a revolver to the cap
tain's head and threatened to blow his
! brains out if he put the ship under sail
; for sea Instead of making for the nearest
' port. The next day the purser, J. Talbot
Watson, and the boatswain joined Fradge-
I ly in the attt-mpt to make him put to

crew forced to obey orders. Captain
Moore put to sea, but was compelled by
I the crew to sail for the Columbia. Af
ter a dangerous voyage, in which the
j crew repeatedly threatened mutiny, the

IBERG WAS
INVINCIBLE
His Superb Pitching
Hard to Beat.
FITZPATRICK WAS VERY EASY.
SO WEBE THE HARD-HITTING
ATHLETICS.
Ban Joses Play Beautifully, While
Their Opponents Play Miser
ably, Both at Bat and
in the Field.
BY JOE CORBETT.
The San Jose "Florists," through ex
cellent playing-, combined with hard and
opportune hitting, assisted by the superb
pitching of Mr. Iberg, completely defeat
ed the Athletics yesterday by the score
of 11 to 0. The largest and by far the
most enthusiastic crowd of the season
was present-
Many of the old stand-bys who In days
gone by have time and again wended
their way in the direction of. the now de
funct Haight street grounds to give their
lungs a little exercise, were conspicuous
by their cries of "Kill the umpire" and
such other remarks of that nature which
emanate only from the faithful and con
sistent rooter.
They had occasion to show their dis
pleasure on a couple of Mr. Sweeney's
decisions, and did so nobly, but with poor
results. Mr. Reilly, the premier second
baseman of the league, also strenuously
objected to Mr. Sweeney's way of engin
eering things, and there Is no doubt In
the world but what Charley will have to
study up a bit. He is competent enough
to render decisions in most instances, yet
there are a few points on which he is ig
norant, and these few should be mas
tered immediately. There is only one
thing to do in such a pinch and that is to
stop the game a few moments and glance
over the rule book. In this manner order
may be preserved and a possible riot pre
vented. It is very poor policy to render
a decision when not positively sure that
it is correct. Mr. Sweeney's mistakes,
however, in no manner interferred with
the results of the game. The Athletics
were beaten beyond the shadow of a
doubt, as the score proves, and their
playing was miserable compared to what
it has been in the past. It was a bril
liant yellow (tuch as the Frisco's*) J and
what made it appear ten times j worse
was the cruel, unclub-like methods em
ployed by those "Florists" when facing
Sir Foghorn Fitzpatrick. Eleven hits all
told were made off his straight balls (I
say straight balls because he displayed
nothing else), and they were of the kind
that are not soon forgotten. Fitzpatrick,
however, has been doing more than his
share of good work so far this season,
and pitchers have off days, as do entire
teams, so it would hardly be in order to
censure him.
The same can be said of the team that '
I him up. They have done all that
rpected of them by both public and
igement, and their poor playing yes
y, in view of this fact, must not be
too severely condemned. Even if they had
played a better game in the field, the re-
BUlt must be the same. Iberg, with his
Blow, tantalizing caroms, was simply in
vincible. Only once during the game did
it look as if his opponents wou
He was equal to the occasion, however,
as he Invariably is when in form, and the
hopes of Messrs. Crowley and ivapliu
were shattered to smithereens when the
cessaxy to replace one of those
â¢ Kgs disappeared Into the hands of
Brockhoff. Mr. Iberg. like Mr. Darlcn,
was given almost perfect Bupport. His
team played a beautiful game, and its i
work of Saturday and yesterday stamps
It as one of the most dangerous clubs in i
the league. It would be almost impossible
lor them to play better ball, and may
tli-'ir goid work continue, for it is appre
ciated. Mr. McGueken and the managers
of the team are to be congratulated. They
gone to no little expense In securing
the services of most of the players, and
s apparently is crowning their ef-
Tho players, every one of them, go
their task in a business like man
ner, In yesterday's game not an oppor
tunity was overlooked, save in the case
of Brockhoff when caught between third
and home, when he should have dashed
lor the plate instead of watching what
was going to bappi n to Hanley. Tne mis
take can be easily overlooked, but, mind
you, Brock, don't let it happen again.
The only thing that saves you in this case
:r earnest work in t&e past. Be
now, as Westan is authority forthe
?>ient that your salary is to be raised.

THE SAIS" FRANCISCO fcALL, MONDAY, JTJjSTE 20, 1898.
FOR FREEDOM
A FAST HOUND
Imported Dog Showed
Bursts of Speed.
LIGHTNING FAST HARES
MYBTLE PROVED A SURPRISE
TO THE TALENT.
Blackette and Glen Roy Make a
Long and Sensational Course
After an Intelligent
Hare.
Five thousand followers of the fasci
nating pastime, coursing, were treated
to the finest kind of soort at Union Park
yesterday. Xot only did they witness the
longest course seen in this city in years
between Blackette and Glen Roy, but
they saw For Freedom. J. H. Rosseter's
magnificent lightning fast importation
from England pass his rivals as if they
were standing still and land the Cham
pion stake.
An exceptional fast lot of hares were
turned loose during the day and the
manner in which they led the fleet hounds
over the course created wonder and en
thusiasm among those present.
Larkoy & Rooks' Myrtle won the maid
en stake to the surprise of every one.
Wayfarer and Commodore were picked
by the talent to lnnd the purse, but to
their chagrin, Commodore was put out of
the struggle early in the game, and al
though Wayfarer was In the final, he was
unable to beat the winner owing to the
hard courses he had experienced pre
viously.
The principal event of the day was the i
championship stake offered by the Inter- ]
state Coursing Clubs in which eight dogs j
competed. For Freedom was made fa
vorite by the talent and he did not dis- !
appoint them. He met for the first time ;
the heretofore invincible Santa Clara]
bitch Rosette and ran away from her. 1
When he klljed the hare there was over
four lengths difference between them.
Short ends had the best of the stake,
however, as False Flatterer with odds
of two to one against her beat Metallic,
and Rusty Gold, another favorite, lost to
Skylall at the same odds.
The feature of the maiden stake event
waa the course between B'.ackette and
U'.en Roy. An exceptionally fine hare
was released and set a heartrending pace
for its pursuers. Twice it crossed the
field and by rjuick turns and bewildering
dodging covered over four miles. The |
pace proved too much for the hounds and j
they faltered, neither being able to close \
in on the tired hare, as it crawled to a i
place of safety. Blackette was given a
decision, but was withdrawn on the .n^xt
round owing to fatigue. It was (eared
that she would die and mipht have done
bo but for the energetic work of her
trainers.
Lady Campbell defeated Tod Sloan In
another long course in which both took
bad falls in trying to grab their prey.
The former was withdrawn by her hu
mane owner. Jesse Moore beat Flashlight,
who was selling favorite at 3 to 1 and
shortenders reaped a harvest.
In the final for the champion stak'?
False Flatterer and For Freedom com
peted. The former showed improved form
and many banked on him to win at odds
of 8 to 1. Their hopes were nearly real
ized during the first half minute of the
race, as the English dog ran unsighted.
The shortender began to close In on the :
hare, but For Freedom caught sight of \
the fleeing bunnie and with tremendous
bounds caught up with his rival and in a
lightning drive passed her and caught the
hare.
The winner bas won four events, two
open and two championship stakes, since
coming to this co*ast. As a pup he divided
the great Altcar cup with his sister
Flushed Face, in which 128 dogj com
peted. He was purchased by Mr. Rosse
ter, who also owns Firm Friend and
other well known animals. Jim Edmonds,
one of the oldest and best known cours
ing men, threatens to sell all his property
and import a dog from England within
the next six months to beat the Invinci
ble hound. It will have to be done as the
local dogs now running only exercise him.

THE THREE
TAILORS OF
TOOLEY STREET
They Have Come to Life and Have
Constituted Themselves the
Democratic Party.
The Trio Live Again as "Whispering" Gavin Mc-
Nab, Frank "Hood" Gould and William
"Hallucination" Alford.
The Three Tailors rÂ»f Tooley Street,
who once upon a time constituted
themselves the people of England,
have come to life again and have now
constituted themselves the Democratic
party of San Francisco.
The joke Is on the party, of course,
but the Tooley street tailors are real
ghosts who take themselves so seri
ously that they have convinced them
selves that they own the earth, besides
having a chattel mortgage on Mayor
Phelan. â  When these three tailors first
blossomed In Tooley street and de
clared themselves to be the English
people and the whole prehistoric
cheese, they were sat upon so hard
that they at once ceased to be any-
thing other than a comic grease spot
on the face of history. With the fleet
irig cenruries has come wipdom, and
now that they have again walked out
of tlio pages of the past they propose
to take charge of th<- earth on the in
stallment plan. As a moderate and
modest beginning they have declared
ownership of the local Democracy.
In order that ordinary mortals, who
â¢appreciate greatness in any form, may
not make any mistake as to th*- Iden
tity of these three great men who have
deserted, the needle for the pc^pter, a
description of them will not be out of
place.
"WTiisppring-" Gavin McNab i? easily
the sreateFt of th<--sÂ» three great tail
ors. He is descended from "Smooth"
John McNab, who flourished during
the reign of JarriPÃ V. It is said that
this original McNab "was a wonder in
his way. and that he bo conducted
himreif during his lifetime that when
he died his neighbors gave birth to the
Scottish proverb: "While there are
trees In the wood there will be deceit
in a McNab."
"Whispering" Gavin first came into
promin^n^e .'h^n he attached himself
to the person find the patronage of the
late Republican boss, William Higgins.
When Higgins lost his power Gavin
changed his politics and crept beneath
the protecting wintr of Bom Buckley.
In 1890 he became a reformer, but not
until he had proven himself to be a
champion of scab labor and had been
finned down by Buckley. In 1892 he
v.'.-.s expelled from the executive com
mittee of the general committee of the
Democratic party for treason and dis
loyalty to the party. But like Rob Roy
he is long of reach and is known to be
tha best procurer of proxies In the
town.
Another of the famous Tooley-street
trio is Frank "Hood" Gould. He is an
Indirect descendant of that great Eng
lish philanthropist, Robin Hood, who
used to make things lively In Sher
wood forest by the judicious use of a
long bow and a sand bag. Frank, like
Robin, is a good provider, and he, as
well as numerous relatives, are feeding
at the public crib.
The remaining tailor Is William
"Hallucination" Alford, otherwise
known as the "Single-tax Curio of Tu
lare." He is the heavy weight of the
outfit, and is said to be troubled with
dreams that he oueht to be Governor
of the State. When he Is only half
asleep he dreams that he Is destined to
be attorney for the State P ard of Har
bor Commissioners. He is proud, but
not entirely; unhappy, and has often
been likened to Clitus Marcus Brutus
Barbour, that flower of the sandlots,
of whom Jt has been said that he Is a
"statesman without guile, a barrister
without briefs and an Adonis without
beauty." He is known to have but one
regret in life, and that is that he was
not born in Scotland, the land of the
thistle and the McNabs.
In order to carry out their scheme of
universal domination these three i sfit
tailors have appointed a .ommittee of
one hundred, thirty-four members of
which are lawyers, who at the tame
time are patriots on a still hunt for
office. By a strange coincidence there
are Just enough offices to go around.
All of the lawyers do not live in the
city, but the tailors say they do, and
that Is as good as an oath of registra
tion.
The Tooley street gentlemen have
prepared a slate, and in this work they
have been assist d by their chairman,
the Hon. John Placehunter Dunn, who
was selected to fill the responsible posi
tion of presiding officer because he is
the fairest blossom in the bouquet of
aandlot flowers, a present Federal of
fice holder, a jobchaser of twenty years'
experience and the man who first in
troduced the popular plan of importing
relatives from the old country to fill
fat positions in this land of the free and
the home of the McXabs, the Goulds
and the Alfords.
The slate, after being prepared and
put in a filter, has leaked out. It is as

THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 20, 1898.
HER SMILE MADE HIM DESPERATE.
Louis Mohlfeldt Fires Two Shots at Himself, Dut Fails
to Puncture His Skin.
Domestic troubles, coupled with business reverses, impelled Louis Mohl
feldt. a cigar peddler, to commit suicide last evening.
Armed with a 32-caliber imitation Colt's revolver Mohlfeldt visited a
vacant lot at Eighth and Howard streets and proceeded to end his ex
istence. He first placed the weapon against his right temple and pulled the
tripper. The bullet grazed the flesh and tore away a portion of his eyebrow.
Angered at his, failure to kill himself Mohlfeldt pointed the pistol at his
heart and blazed away. Again his aim was bad, the bullet doing no more
damage than to cut through the flesh. At this juncture Police Officer
Richard McGrayan of the Southern Station, who had been attracted to the
scene by the report of the pistol shots, entered the lot and prevented Mohl
feldt from taking another shot at himself. He was then taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where his wounds were dressed by Dr. Frank Fitzgibbon.
Mohlfeldt was In an extremely nervous state when taken to the hospital.
His right wrist was bandaged, the result, he claimed, of a former attempt
to commit puioide.
According to his story he has not spoken to his wife for over ten years.
"We had a dispute over family matters," he remarked, with a faint sem
blance of a smile, "and it was mutually agree that we should cease
speaking to each other. Last Friday, despondent and sick at heart, I bor
rowed a chisel from a neighbor and went to Sutro Heights intending to kill
myself. Selecting a quiet nook, free from the possibility of interference,
I jabbed the chisel into my wrist, cutting an artery. After watching the
flow of blood for some time, and becoming faint, I concluded to see my
wife before I died. I tied a handkerchief around my wrist so as to tempo
rarily stop the flow of blood and boarding a street car rode to my home.
My wife was standing at the gate and when she saw me she first smiled
and then in a rather sarcastic tone asked me why I had not made a good
job of it. As these were the first words she had spoken to me in ten long
years I wanted to embrace her, but as she seemed cold and distant I con
cluded to make another attempt on my life. Finding an old revolver in my
drawer I placed it In my pocket, determined to make the second and fatal
attempt as I thought. I told my oldest boy to prepare his mother for the
news of my supposed tragic deed, but she did not seem affected in the
least
"Shortly after 7 o'clock I left my home, after casting a farewell look
at my wife. Going to the lot on Eighth street I vainly endeavored to kill
myself. I was nervous, and this alone was responsible for my failure to
eend a bullet through my heart. Had the officer not appeared I believe I
would have succeeded in doing myself up."
Mohlfeldt, notwithstanding that he has not spoken to his wife for so
many years, lived under the same roof with her. They communicated
through their children, of which they have three.
After his wounds were dressed Mohlfeldt was locked up in a padded
cell to prevent him from making another attempt to take his life.
NEW CHURCH
FOR ITALIANS
Corpus Christi Dedicated
by the Archbishop.
MASS FOLLOWS CEREMONY.
MANY PEJESTS WERE IN AT
TENDANCE.
A Banquet Is Tendered the Arch
bishop by the New Pastor.
Vespers in the
Evening.
The Church of Corpus Christ!, the new
Catholic church recently completed on
Alemany and Croke streets in the Ocean
View district, was dedicated to divine
worship yesterday morning with impres
sive solemnity by Archbishop Riordan.
The ceremony of dedication which was
THE NEW CHURCH OF CORPUS CHRIST!
held at 10 o'clock was preceded by a pro
cession of little children robed in white;
Company O of the League of the Cross in
full uniform, who with a number of
priests escorted the Archbishop and his
assistants to the new church. It was an
impressive spectacle to see the little pro
cession slowly wending its way down the
street leading to the new church headed
by the acolytes, robed in the garments of
the altar, and bearing the brazen and
glistening cross above the black-robed
priests.
Upon arriving at the church the proces
sion baited and the Archbishop, following
the sacred crucifix borne by the acolytes,
entered the new edifice. The interior,
which is modeled somewhat after the ar
chitecture of St. Ignatius Cathedral, was
aglow with myriads of candles and beau
; tifiiily decorated with Bermuda lilies and
I other rare flowers and exotic growths.
Immediately to the left of the main al
tar was the Archbishop's throne, elabor
ately decorated and adorned with white
and pink tapestries. It was Â«ent express
ly for the occasion by the Sllesian Com
munity of Sts. Peter and Paul's Church
| on Filbert and Dupont streets, of which
the Church of Corpus Chrlstl Is a branch.
The dedication service consisted of the
consecration of the edifice, together with
I the altars, statues and various appur-
I tenances. The deacons of honor to the
Archbifhop in the ceremony were Fathers
Connelly and Mulligan.
Immediately after the dedication cere
i mony solemn high mass was celebrated
| by the superior of the Franciscan order,
assisted by Father Butler of the Jesuit
College as deacon and Father Casslni, the
i pastor of the new church, aa sub-deacon
The sermon, which was delivered by
Archbishop Rlorrian in Knglish, was on
the subject of the dedication of the new
church.
An exhortation beseeching the Italians
i in the neighboring gardens to cease work
i for the day and attend mass in their new
church was printed in the form of a plac
ard and distributed freely among them.
As a consequence the little edinco was
filled to overflowing with a congregation
of hard-working and industrious men and
women.
One of the features of the dedication
was the rendition of Mercadante's mass
by a choir under the direction of Miss
Mary Rogers. The following were the
principal singers: Sopranos, Miss May
â  Reilly. Miss Oliva L. Vautlin and Miss
| Lulu Curtaz; tenor George Oliva; con
traltos, Miss Kate Danari and M!Â«s A.
O'Sulllvan: ba.ssos. Tl. "W. Swords, Ed
ward Loughery and Joseph Broycr.

ADVOCATE
A COAST
GUN PLANT
Leading Citizens Want
One in Benicia.
BOTH HOUSES PETITIONED
CONGRESSMEN WILL LEND
THEIR ASSISTANCE.
The Desirability of Establishing Such
a Works in This State Approved
by Public - Spirited
Persons.
Effort is being made by a number of
well-known citizens of this State to have
the Government establish a gun assem
bling plant at Benicia, and so far the
movers of the project have met with
much success.
The representatives of this State in Con
gress are working energetically to have
the plan carried out and leading members
of the House from other States, appre
ciating the need of such a works in this
portion of the country, have notified the
committee that they will lend their co
operation when the matter comes up for
hearing.
The citizens who are advocating the es
tablishment of the plant are James W.
Kerry-. W.i Li. Crooks, A. Robinson, Wake
field Baker, D. M. Hart, Robert W. Lamb
ley and Herbert Kullman, residents of
this city and Benicia. A neatly gotten
up petition setting forth the reasons for
the need of such a plant and suggesting
Benicia as the best place has been for
warded to the Senate and Congress.
An excellent" map showing the desira
bility of the location is appended, and the
petition is signed by leading firms and cit
izens of the State. It is in these words:
We, your petitioners, residents of the State
of California, respectfully and earnestly re
quest your support and aid in our endeavors
looking to the establishment and equipment by
the United States Government of a gun as
sembling plant for the Pacific Coast. The "
necessity of such a gun assembling plant for
this coast Is manifest, and it is respectfully
urged by your petitioners, that of all Bites on
the Pacific Coast, the site at Benicia. Cali
fornia, is the one that is most suitable and
best adapted to the establishment of a Gov
ernmental gun plant for ordnance.
In order that error may be avoided in the
selection of a suitable site, and your petition
ers believing that Benicia, Cal., should be se
lected by the United States as a site for the
(â¢establishment of such gun plant, we beg to
submit the following: -.
First â At Benicia the Government already
owns a large reservation consisting of about
&-.0 acres of land, all bordering on the waters
of Carqulnez Straits, and upon this reservation
are situated an arsenal and barracks, where
a garrison of troops is stationed. Upon the
arsenal reservation there are several large and
substantial structures of brick and stone, all
in good condition. Among these buildings are
a well-equipped machine shop of two floorsâ
260 feet in length and 80 feet in widthâ a black
smith shop sufficiently large to run ten fires,
being ir.O feet in length by 60 feet in width,
and a carpenter shop. 150 feet In length and
300 in width. ,
Secondâ The Carquinez Straits are of suffi
cient depth at the lowest tide to afford ample
facilities for the dockage and anchorage of tha
largest war vessel. The proposed site for the
gun assembling plant is of easy access for the
largest war vessels from San Francisco and
from Mare Island.
Thirdâ The proposed site is situated within
five miles by water from the United States navy
yard at Mare Island, and is upon the main line
of California's principal railroad. .
Fourthâ The climate of Benicia Is healthful
and â  unsurpassed. The fresh water supply is
good and abundant.
Fifthâ Adjacent to the proposed site 'excel
lent stone suitable for the construction of the
buildings of the gun plant can be procured in
large quantities and at small cost.
Sixthâ lmmediately surrounding the proposed
site are proving grounds and miles of range
affording the best facilities for the testing of
the largest gun*. The topography of the pro
posed Bite Is such as is well adapted to the
mounting of large guns on high ground for the
purpose of testing them.
, Seventhâ Carquinez Straits are deep and suffi
ciently narrow to afford ample facilities for
protecting the approach to the proposed Rite in
such manner that it would be absolutely safe
from attack by a foreign enemy.
Eighth â In 1890 there was appointed by the
United States Government a commission con
sisting of three very eminent army officers.
Major Bufflngton, United States Ordnance
Corps; Major Craighlll, United States Engineer
Corps, and Major Dutton,' United States Artil
lery, whose duty It was to examine and report
upon the best site for a gun plant upon the
Pacific Coast. This commission made a thor
ough examination of the various points on the
Pacific Coast, and after such examination the
commission made a unanimous report to the
Department of War advising that Benlcta be
selected as the' site upon which a gun plant
should be established. The report of this com
mission is now on file in the War Department
at Washington. ; ..;
In view of the fact that the Government . of
the United States already i possesses a site at
Benicia suitable for a gun plant, and In view
of the fact that the proposed site possesses the
many great advantages above set forth, and
sincerely believing that It is an absolute neces
sity that a gun plant should be established on
the Pacific Coast to perfect the military plans
of â¢; the Government of the United States, we,
your, petitioners, again urgently request that
Buch action be taken as will in the near future
Insure the establishment at Benicia by the
Government of the United States of a gun plant
for the assembling, finishing., and testing of
ordnance. __^__^^_______
FAMOUS NEWSPAPER
MAN IN THIS CITY
A JOURNALIST'S CRITICISMS OF
OTJR BAD STREETS.
Editor Costello Says Our Pavements
Blight San Francisco's Many
Beauties â New York as a
Shining Example.
Augiistlne E. Costello, better known as
"Gus," one of the best known newspaper
men of New York City and for many
years a member of the staff of the Her
ald, is on a visit to San Francisco for his
health. lie has had a very active career
dating from his arrival in the United
States about thirty years ago in com
pany with many other Irish patriots who
had perforce for a long time been enjoy
ing the hospitality of the British Govern
ment in Dublin Castle, charged with be
ing Fenians. Mr. Costello laughs at this
period of his life and refers to It as "an
Incident of youth." Tie has experienced j
all the stormy journalistic times in New
York, from the days of the Tweed ring
scandals and exposures to the latter-day
efforts and successes of Rev. Mr. Park
hurst in connection with the reform of
the police department of the big city.
"It was my intention," said Mr. Cos
tello, "to make a trip to the old country,
but I concluded there was enough to be
seen in the United States, and I am very
glad I came this way. I must say that I
am very agreeably surprised at what I
nave seen. Of course in this country we
drew comparisons of metropolitan cities
from New York, and I must say that of
;ill the cities I have visited, next to the
metropolis, Ban Francisco impresses me
the most. When I take a walk on Mar
ket street I can easily imagine myself on
Broadway, not alone by reason o the
crowds, but because of the energy and
activity of your people. Tin's is a beau

improvements are costly to begin with,
but the economy in nerves alone is suffi
cient to pay for them in a short time.
Well-paved streets constitute one of the
best advertisements a city can have and
when San Francisco realizes this fact
and takes advantage of its opportunities
it will take Its place In the front rank
of the most beautiful cities of the world."

"The Ships That Go."
"The ships that go," taken from the one
hundred and twenty-sixth Psalm, fourth
verse, was the text of Rev. E. Nelander,
at the First English Lutberaa Church on
Geary street last evening, the subject of
his discourse being the departure of the
second Philippine expedition. "This
event " said he, "marks an important
epoch' in the world's history. We are al
ways too near great events to appreciate
them The nations of the earth are look
ins to the United States and are wonder
ing what will be the outcome. They have
been watching us since the close of the
Civil War. which established the princi
ples of liberty and made the constitution
no longer a hollow mockery. Our progress
has been unparalleled !n the history of the
world. We were the only nation that had
the courage to step in and intervene in
behalf of the down-troarten people of
Cuba Our flag now stands for more than
our own liberty. This movement means
the spread of human freedom and the
propagation of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
and God is directing this war for the pro
motion of civilization and true religion."
