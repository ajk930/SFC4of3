QUEEN REGENT
SEEKING NOW
TO MAKE PEACE
Working as Only a Woman Can
to Avoid Plunging the Land
She Loves Into War.
Copyrlrhted, 189S, by James Gordon Bennett.
MADBID, April 6.â Of all the
great surprises in the extraordinary
diplomatic struggle between the
United States and Spain, during
â which we have been on the verge of
war twice during the last few days,
the greatest is yet to come. At the
present time there is on foot a great
end final attempt for peace which
has every prospect of being success
ful.
And I state this when all around
are talking war, wnen men of peace
have become jingoes, when troops
ere being hurried to Spanish ports,
when hot haste is being 1 made in dis
patching ships from various ports to
Unite at Cadiz, when, unless this plan
X speak of succeeds, Spain will send
forth the best fleet she can muster
end it will be one that will have to
be reckoned with.
It is impossible for me to tele
graph you what I know. I might
frustrate one of the most noble at
tempts at peace ever made in the his
tory of the world, and peace may yet
be written in large letters of gold
where those spelling war in letters
of blood might have been.
I can merely say, as an indication,
that if it comes, it will be from the
hands of a good and pious woman,
Bpeaking in the name of all that is
jnost holy upon earth, the beautiful
message of peace to Cuba.
Yesterday's optimism is replaced
by an equal amount of pessimism,
end this was reflected on the Bourse,
where the fall was from 2 to 3
points. But, as every one is crying
war, and pessimism is at its height,
let me tell, on unquestionable au
thority, that the situation is far from
lost and that, although diplomacy
may appear paralyzed, there are ex
traordinary means, which are born
in times such as these, have risen
into existence in tne face of the
threatened storm and by which cisver
heads and devoted hearts may yet
nicceed in proclaiming peace.
This may seem enigmatical, but
take my word there is a vast deal
behind it. I will ro further and tell
you emphatically, in the fÂ«ce of all
pessimists, jingoes and alarmists,
that peace has not only one string
to its bow, out two. Further, be it
stated, that none of the theories or
rumors so far advanced has any
r-'fernjioe to these po6sible means
which are at present inviolable se
crets.
The preparations for war continue.

PROSPECT FOR PEACE.Â£
MADRID. April 6.â The family
of United States Minister Wood
ford started this afternoon for
Biarritz, France.
The staff of the United States
legation has left Madrid and will
probably remain in Paris for the
present.
The hope of reaching a peace
ful settlement with the United
States Is growing stronger. It Is
reported that the basis of an ar
mistice in Cuba has been ar
ranged. If this be true a royal
decree will appear in the gazette
to-morrow or Friday announcing
the conclusion of an armistice.
Mr. McCalmont's famous yacht, the
Giralda, is being fitted out with
rapid-fire guns, and will be used for
a dispatch boat. The torpedo boat
destroyer, after a perilous voyageâ
for the tempests have been terrible
lately â has arrived at Cadiz, where
she finds her traveling companions,
which she lost en route.
The Infanta Maria Teresa, Cristo
bal Colon and Carlos V are expected
to-day from Havre at Ferrol. The
warships are undergoing the final
fittings of their armament, which
was made on the journey in order to
make good speed to Cadiz. The tor
pedo fleet at Cadiz has, by order of
the Minister of Marine, been rein
forced by the Habana, the Barcelona,
the Retamosa and the Orion. The
first three will be attached to the
second torpedo squadron, should it
start. The Audaz and Osado, torpedo
boat destroyers, are still waiting to
make up the second squadron.
The Vizcaya and Oquendo, which
started out from Havana to meet
the torpedo squadron, have been sig
naled bacK, and have gone to Porto
Rico. The torpedo squadron, it is un
derstood, is at the Cape Verde Isl
ands.
It is now decided that the Cris
tobal Colon and the Infanta Maria
Teresa would go, in case of need, to
Havana, and the Carlos V and the
Pelayo would remain about the Span
ish coast. The Cardinal Cisneros has
left her dock and is at Ferrol. The
Osadft has left Queenstown for Feirol
and the Audaz, which is in dock
there, is being repaired.
From all parts of the country re
ports come in of patriotic subscrip
tions, patriotic bull fights and pa
triotic theatrical performances.

GRAVE DANGER
OF A RIOT IN
CUBA'S CAPITAL
Lee Making Every Effort to Get
Americans Out of the City Be
fore the Storm Breaks.
Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Cuba (via Herald-Call dispatch
boat Sommers N. Smith to Key West,
Fla.), April 6. â Havana is in grave peril
from within and without. Any fool can
start a riot the consequence of which will
be remembered for a century, and Morro's
walls may crumble to pay the price of his
folly.
Soon after the Smith dropped anchor
alongside the Fern yesterday the Bache and
Mangrove steamed into Havana harbor and
the stars and stripes stood out stoutly in
the breeze from the staffs of four vessels â a
welcome sight, truly, to the eyes of the
Americans ashore, who may have grave need
at any time of ships of refuge. Americans
with whom I talked, while the gravity of the
situation lay full upon th?m, did not forget
to speak in high terms of the forbearance
of Havana's people up to the present time
and to add that, while the Prado was filled
with drilling boys and while raw recruits
and veterans alike have the breath of war
in their nostrils, no foreign citizen had yet
been molested. This was all the more note
worthy in view of the fact that the Havana
press had not hesitated from day to day to
inflame the rabble by reference to "Yankee
pigs," while the lowest element had been fed
on inflammatory circulars calling on the
more bloodthirsty of the patriots to resist
and avenge Spain at the expense of the
strangers within their gates.
Consul-General Lee told me a man who
saw him within the hour was heavy with
anxiety for Americans, who looked to him for
guidance, especially the women and chil
dren. It was felt that the Palace would
do its utmost in the emergency to protect
foreigners. As the Smith left Havana I
learned that Dr. Pea had been suspended or
removed because he was said to have facili
tated the movements of American steamers.
I could not learn the exact nature of the
charge made against him.
The positions of the Fern, Bache and
Mangrove in the harbor of course made it
impossible to leave without the consent of
the authorities, but no one in Havana be
lieved Americans would be in much danger
if once on board these vessels, as the street
mob seemed the chief peril with which for
eigners were confronted. That reminds me
that the Spanish Consul in Key West is said
to have agreed with the British Consul there
to take charge in his stead, fearing trouble
himself in case Consul-General Lee should
meet with harm in Havana or news to that
effect should reach Key West.
Havana has at last awakened to the stern
reality that it is threatened with war which
will be no opera bouffe affair.
The war fever has been increasing since
Friday last but. contrary to expectation, t! â¢
streets have ceased to clamor for blood and
the rabble has taken a quiet turn. On Mon
day night the Parque Centre and the Prado
were crowded with a gesticulating mob
filed with excitement yet refraining from
any attempt at a demonstration. On both
sides of the Prado uniformed volunteers
were drilling, surrounded by interested
friends. One company, organized Monday
night, is composed entirely of boys, the
oldest of whom is not out of his fifteenth
year. In the hands of these infants have
been placed rifles and to them cartridges
will be dealt out. They present the most
dangerous phase of the situation in the city.
An attempt has been made by the local
papers, under instructions from the Pa/ace,
to convince the city that the Pope's media
tion has been accepted by the United States,
which means, diplomatically, a victory for
Spain. For once, however, the public has
refused to be hoodwinked, and the announce
ment that the American Government has
sent the Bache and the Mangrove here to
take away its citizens, native-born and
naturalized, is looked upon as the last step
before the storm. In Obispo street I saw
four small boys, whose combined ages
would not exceed twenty years, parading,
each carrying a toy gun and a tin sword.
Their operations were directed by an offi
cer of the regular army, while not less than
200 spectators gravely watched and com
mented upon their maneuvers.
The Spanish officials in the pa/ace are now
convinced that war is inevitable, hostilities
being postponed simply for (he convenience
of both governments. One whose intelli
gence and understanding are of high grade
talked with me yesterday on the situation.
â¢â¢War," he said, "is unavoidable. It is a
shame it is so, for the Americans and the
Spanish people have no reason for being
enemies. Our interests do not conflict. We
have always admired you, and certainly
Americans have something for which they
should thank Spain. Well, it is now too late
to discuss the right and wrong of the mat
ter. War is at hand. By it right is to be
determined. I recognize that the Cuban
affair has been exasperating to America, but
I do not believe it should have brought about
war. You are a brave people. Some
Spaniards think otherwise, but I
know it is so. You overestimate
your strength because you do not
recognize your lack of military
organization. The Spaniards are brave.
The opposite impress/on prevails in
America because of our iack of success in
Cuba.
"ft is with a keen sense of shame that
Spain realizes that her defeat is due to the
corruption of her officers. Our soldiers are

TO BUY A PRIVATEER
TO SWEEP THE PACIFIC.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
VALPARAISO. Chile, April 6.â
Spaniards In Chile have responded
liberally to the plan recently pro
posed of buying a vessel for the
use of Spain in the event of war
with the United States. I am told
on the best authority that $1,000,000 has been subscribed within a few
weeks for this purpose. Practically all of this money came from the
Spanish colonies in this and other important Chilean cities.
Instead of buying or building a man-of-war, however, as was first
tntended, the sum raised will be devoted to the purchase and equip
ment of a fast steamship for use as a privateer on the Pacific Coast
of the United States.
Up to a late hour to-night the United States grunboat Marietta, en
route here from Callao, has not teen sighted. The port authorities
here will let her commander :hoose his ancher^pe when he enters.
The United States Minister. Mr. Henry L,. Wilson, has taken tem
porary headquarters here and will remain until the Marietta and Ore
gon arrive. The talk of war between Argentina and Chile has subsid
ed, and now all attention Is centered on the pending conflict between
Spain and the United States.

Powelson, who is attached to the

on the wreck of the Maine yes

Spanish prunboat Le Uazpe, who
took the position that Mr. P.>w

scribing a riotous condition of affairs in
Havana, and urging that the message
be withheld for three or four days so as
to give him time for getting all Ameri
cans out of the island. When this cable
gram was received official announce
ment was made that the President's
message would not go to Congress be
fore Monday next.
These kaleidoscope changes in policy
are puzzling. When the Cabinet left the
White House last night the definite
statement was made that the message
would be sent to Congress at noon to
day. When Congress assembled word
came from the White House that there
would be two or three hours' delay.
Later there were hurried conferences
between the President and the leading
members of the two houses, and then
word came that the anxiously awaited
document would not come to Congress
before Monday.
The Senators and Representatives
who conferred with the President
brought word back to their colleagues
that the Chief Executive was justified
in holding this message in the light oi
the present condition of affairs in Ha
vana reported by General Lee.
There is no reason to doubt the
sincerity of the statement of the
President and his official advisers
that the safety of two thousand
Americans under the protecting wing
of General Lee was the immediate
cause for keeping back the msssag'e.
Yet there is no denying that the ad
ministration authorities consider that
the delay may not only be the means of
protecting these Americans, but that
conditions may so change between now
and Monday as to possibly avert war.
In any event they argue that from the
military standpoint there will be gain
rather than loss by the delay.

Washington, April 6.
The d^lay in the settlement of the Cuban question, involved in the
announcement made to-day that the President's message would prob
aMy not be -sent to Congress before next Monday, was received in the
Benate with varying degrees of favor or disfavor, depending largely
i the predictions and personal political associations of Senators. All
in Ited in the necessity for protecting the safety of General Lee and the
other American citizens in Cuba. Many, however, were inclined to criti

"It is a humiliating spectacle," said Senator Quay of Pennsylvania,
it with our fleet within ninety miles of Havana we are not able

"The request." said Senator Proctor, "merely illustrates the char

probability of an armistice in Cuba was made known they found in

I was a-sured by three members of his

com: pliance with his last de
pain, which were rejected
by the Sagasta Ministry, will prevent
the President carrying out the policy
outlined in the vigorous message which
he now has upon his desk.
So I ly convinced is the Pres
ident that the time has come for action,
and so earnest is his desire to work in
harmony with Congress, that he made a
few changes in his message this morn
ing to meet the view- or some of the re
calcitrant member.-; of J.he Committee on
Foreign Affairs. He changed it so as
to make a >pecific recommendation for
immediate intervention. His message
was alread tj on that point, but
he mad.- it stronger.
He showed the message and the tele
gram from Consul-General Lee to his
â  Congressional advisers, and asked their
advice as to what he should do about
withholding the document. They all
agreed with him that in the light of Gen
eral Lee's advices it was prudent to
withhold the mcv-age, and assured him
that Congress will wait until Monday.
Since conferring with the Con
gressional members this afternoon
the President has received a lengthy
cablegram from Minister Woodford
containing a new proposition from
the Madrid Government.
Tt is now under consideration. Xo
information will be officially given out
about this latest dispatch from Minis
ter Woodiord, but it i< believed to be
confirmatory of the afternoon press dis
patches stating that the Queen Regent
had taken the matter in her own hands
and decided to r-,:npiy with the original
demands of President McKinley for an
armistice, which contemplates the with
drawal of the Spanish troops and the
establishment of a form of government
which will be satisfactory to the Cubans.
I have positive knowledge that
France, Italy and Austria, with the co
opration of the Pope, have been exert
ing r.!l the influence at their command
to induce the Queen Regent to take
this course.
The further information cabled from
Madrid this aftcrnon to the effect that
a Cabinet crisis in Madrid is imminent
is what was expected here in case the
Queen yielded to the pressure brought
to bear upon her. The three powers
named, 1 understand from absolutely
reliable source*, assured the Queen they
would guarantee the safety of the dyn
asty in os<- she would issue a proclama
tion j>r< \i<'i:iK r for an armistice which
would end the war and with the ulti
mate end of giving the Cubans their in
dependence.
The diplomat who gave me this in
formation says he expects to see a proc
lamation promulgated by the Queen to
morrow declaring in favor of an armis
tice with conditions which would be ac
ceptable to the insurgents and to the
United States.
It remains to be seen what view the
President will take of the new proposi
tion. It is known that the dispatch from
Minister Woodford has again encour
aged the authorities to believe there may
be yet a peaceful solution of the great
problem. As was states in the Herald
this morning, Minister Woodford cabled
the President last night that he expected
to have important information to report
to-day. A lengthy message from him
this afternoon, I am positively assured.
refers to the Queen's new proposition
for peace, and contemplates the reopen
ing of negotiations with the President.
There will be a Cabinet meetins on the
subject to-morrow.
The day at the White House has been
momentous to one of its occupants.
This morning he was steeled to meet
the emergency of the hour, and was
awaiting the verdict which the American
people would render when they had
heard the summing up of the case of the
United States against Spain. He was
calmer than he had been for many days.
The tumult in his breast had been
quelled, and the sea of indecision, whose
waves had tossed him hither and thither,
had subsided.
Men not entirely great are relieved
when serious responsibility is shifted
to some one else.
The President is one of these, and
he felt that his wretchedness and misery
were but memories. But there were to
transpire, in the swift hours, events that
were destined to involve him again in
considerations complicated and exact
ing, and ere they had passed he had pre
pared himself for another ordeal no less
oppressive, perhaps, than its predeces
sor.
The message had been comoleted. but
early in the day Attorney General
Griggs came and some changes were
made in the important document. The
Cabinet officers,, once so loquacious,
have grown secret, since dealing with
the Spaniards, whose subtlest ally is
secrecy, regarding their intentions. It
was hinted, however, that the President
and Griggs made the message stronger,
and that the intervention it would call
for would not be of a character that
would look like an invitation for fur
ther delay in bringing the present com
plications to a crisis.
Following the Jersey man, came
Adams, Representative, and Frye. Spoon
er and Fairbanks, Senators, representing
the Foreign Relations Committee of
both houses.
It was arranged that the resolu
tions calling for intervention to be
reported in two Houses should be
identical.
Frye looked, when he came outside.
as if the resolution pleased him. This
surmise is correct. There will be no
criticism on the measure from the peo
ple at large.
Then the real events of the day began
to pile up. A decision was reached on
the subject of following the passage of
the intervention resolution with an im
posing demonstration of the military
and naval strength of the United States
so as to say to the Spanish, in the idio
matic language of the little boy, "Some
body'll lam you if you don't look out."
This was reached in a conference with
Griggs, Long, of the Navy, and Alger,
Secretary of War.
Suddenly the dense, dull air at the
White House became surcharged
with excitement. The forced calm of
the past few days was dissipated.
Assistant Secretary of State Day had
received a telegram from General Lee
announcing a serious state of affairs
at Havana; that the volunteers were
arming; that the Mangrove and
Bache had not been able to accommo
date Americans desiring to leave the
country, and requesting that the
message to Congress be delayed in
order to save further sacrifice to
Spanish hate.
There was no hesitancy about ac
quiescing at once with the request. Just
as this conclusion was reached. Senators
Frye, Davis and Lodge, of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, suggest
ed that the Democrats be called into
conference, and a telephone message to
the House brought Representatives
Hopkins, Dinsmore, Savers and Berry.
Democrats, and Newlands, Silver Re
publican, members of the House For
eign Affairs Committee, to the exec
utive mansion.
Congress had already been informed
of the decision before these arrivals, but
they, of course, approved this action.
Later in the afternoon the President au
thorized the announcement that the
message would go in on Monday.
After these stirring moments came an
other matter of importance. A cable
cipher from Minister Woodford indi
cated an intention on the part of the
Queen Regent of Spain to relieve the
Ministers of responsibility for settling
the difficulty with the United States,
and to undertaking the management of
it herself. Hope bubbled up in the
bosom of the President that perhaps a
woman's hand would lead the way from
chaos, and her soothing touch allay the
fierce, impetuous anger of two nations,
but bubbles break.
To-night McKinley is watching
Havana with heavy, anxious eyes.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THUKSDAT, APRIL 7, lÂ»yÂ».
He knows a riot there and the injury
of one American means war. He
knows that if a hair of Lee's head is
touched it means the kind of war
that Sherman said was "hell."
I am able to state authoritatively that
the messages from Consul General Lee
and Lieutenant Commander Cowles are
in substance:
On account of lack of steamer ac
commodations Consul General Lee
has been unable to remove the Amer
icans from Havana at the time (be
fore noon to-day) specified by the
President. There are now two thou
sand Americans, native-born and
naturalized, who are being fed by the
Consul General and more are arriving
in Havana hourly. The situation has
taken a critical phase by reason of
the action of the volunteers, who, ex
cited by recent events and anticipat
ing a warlike message from Presi
dent McKinley, are parading the
streets, and there is danger of riots
with the massacre of Americans as a
result. This condition will be greatly
aggravated when information re
garding the contents of the message
reaches Havana.
General Lee, therefore, urges that the
President delay transmitting his mes
sage to Congress, and states that if it
is made public, he will not be re
sponsible for the safety of Americans.
He believes he will be able to get all
Americans away from Cuba next Sun
day. The steamer Mascotte left this af
ternoon for Key West with ninety-six
passengers, all returning Americans.
The Olivette will leave Key West to
morrow, together with the Bache and
Mangrove.
The supply ship Fern will remain at
Havana and will be the refuge of Gen
eral Lee and the other consular officers
and such Americans as the other ships
may be unable to bring to the United
States.
Immediately after the receipt of Lee's
telegram, the decision was reached to
postpone the transmission of the mes
sage, and a dispatch was sent to General
Lee, informing him oMhe acquiescence
of the President in his request, and urg
ing him to go to any expense he
thought necessary to get Americans
away from Cuba. He was directed to
inform the President the moment the
last American had departed, in order
that the message might at once be laid
before Congress.
In addition to the advices from Gen
eral Lee and Lieutenant Commander
Cowles, it was reported to-day, appar
ently on good authority, that a represen
tative of the Plant Line called on the
President and informed him that his
firm feared an outbreak in Havana, and
that unless he agreed not to send his
message to Congress, his company
would not fel justified in sending its ves
sels to that port. This report was de
nied at the White House in the even-
ing.
Secretary Long advised Captain
Sampson of the serious condition of af
fairs existing in Havana, and directed
him to keep in constant communication
with General Lee, and, if that officer
thought it necessary that warships come
to his aid, to send them with all possible
dispatch. Captain Sampson will also
watch the cable, and should it be found
that it is cut. he will order his vessels
to go to Cuba's capital.
It was rumored to-night that another
man-of-war had been ordered to Havana,
but this rumor could not be verified.
It was reported to-night that General
Lee had left Havana, but denied by
high officials, who pointed out that Gen
e-al Lee would hardly leave his post
when Americans are in grave danger.
Congress was greatly disappointed at
not receiving the message to-day. It
has been difficult for some time past to
restrain a majority of the members of
both houses. Some men were inclined
to jump at conclusions this afternoon,
and when they were first informed that
the mesrage would not be sent in, said
the President was simply playing for
delay and was using Consul General
Lee's cablegram as a pretext. When it
was learned, however, that the Senators
and Representatives who have been
called to the White House had them
selves advised holding the message back
until every American was out of Cuba,
there was general acquiescence.
There are men in both houses who
sincerely hope that in the meantime the
President may be able to effect some
peaceful settlement of the general Cuban
question.
On the other hand the majority in
both Houses as sincerely regard the
destruction of the Maine as casus
belli.
They believe the United States should
sweep the western hemisphere to
avenge the loss of that vessel and of her
officers and men. and they do not want
the case of United States versus Spain
weakened by the adjustment of any
feature of it before its final settlement by
the war which they consider inevitable.
COMING CHANGES IN
THE STATE LIBRARY.
SACRAMENTO, April 6.â Hon. Frank
L. Coombs, the recently appointed State
Librarian, is arranging to take full
charge of the library on the 15th inst. The
persons appointed at the last meeting of
the Board of Trustees in San Francisco
are all here, and through the courtesy
of Miss Genevieve Green, the former
Assistant librarian, are being made fa
miliar with the duties exacted in the
various departments.
Miss Green's resignation was contem
plated by her, to take place on the first
of April, but at the earnest solicitation
of the present Board of Trustees she
consented to remain until the 15th, about
which time she will depart for Europe,
where for a period of three years she
will devote herself to study. J. L. Gillls
having resigned his position as assistant,
to take a position of keeper of archives
for the State, made it necessary for Mr.
Dana Perkins to remain in the Law De
partment for the same time, in order that
the incoming Law Librarian might be
made familiar with the duties there.
The students of the High School, who
reap a great profit from their access to
the library, are particularly earnest in
their words of praise and appreciation
of the assistance that has always been
given them in their literary researches.
The incoming Librarian and assistant also
appreciate the kindness and attention
paid them by their predecessors. Speak
ing of their reception, Librarian Coomb*
said:
"It is very gratifying to me and those
who will be associated with me to find
so enthusiastic a willingness on the part
of all of the retiring employes in the State
Library to aid us in acquiring famil
iarity with the situation. We have been
received most kindly and courteously,
and I dwire to acknowledge my appre
ciation and gratitude."

our soldiers would fight as they well know

MAY REJECT
INTERVENTION
Cubans Demand Rec
ognition of Their In
dependence.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 6.â The Cuban
Junta, through its counsel, Horatio S.
Rubens, made an important statement
to-day. It declares in the most un
equivocal language that the Cuban
Provisional Government and the Cuban
army would reject absolutely interven
tion by the United States unless it
should be preceded by a recognition of
the independence oi the Cuban repub
lic; that if the United States persisted
in intervening without recognizing Cu
ban independence the Cuban Govern
ment and military forces would refuse
to co-operate; and that, if the United
States troops should be sent to Cuba
upon the basis of intervention without
independence, the Cuban army would,
in the last resort, turn its arms against
the United States.
The statement made by Mr. Rubens
was preceded by the following:
"The declaration I am about to make
is official, fur I am the legal represent
ative of the Junta, and I know
unalterable convictions and position. It
is in line with the utterances of the
delegate of the Cuban Provisional Gov
ernment to the United States, Tomas
Estrada Palma, when the suggestion
was made that this Government should
counsel the Cubans, and, if necessary,
coerce them to an acceptance of auton
omy.
"It was 1 v;ho yettorday, from the
most trustworthy sources of informa
tion, conveyed to the newspaper re
porters the forecast of the burden of
the President's message â intervention
without recognition of independence.
The forecast has been confirmed by
subsequent public events, and the accu
racy of any information in this par
ticular should give authority to the in
formation, even more important, which
I am now to divulge. It has been in
my possession for many hours, and I
have hesitated between my duty as an
American citizen, on the one hand, and,
on the other, as the legal representa
tive of the Cuban Junta, but I regard
the time as now arrived when I must
make these facts known. I have it
from a Spanish authority high in finan
cial circles that the whole course now
proposed by the President is in pursu
ance of an understanding between
Washington and Madrid, the object of
which is to secure peace in Cuba."
After quoting from the address to the
people of the United States, issued by
Mr. Palma, on March 17, Mr. Rubens
says: "In thp face of the present pro
posal of intervention without previous
recognition, it is necessary for us to go
a step further and say that we must
and will regard such intervention as
nothing less than a declaration of war
by the United States against the Cu
ban revolutionists."
EVERY ONE IS
DISAPPOINTED
Statesmen and Spectators
Wait in Vain for the
Message.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington. April 6.
After waiting -atiently in the gal
leries and corridors of the House for
hours, many of them from 8 o'clock
until shortly before 3 o'clock this after
noon, the thousands who had come to
hear the President's message turned
away weary and disgusted at the de
lay. Never was there such disappoint
ment at the Capitol. The members felt
it even more keenly than the specta
tors, and for two hours afterward they
stood about the lobbies discussing the
latest phase of the situation.
The news of the proposed armistice
which came on the heels of the an
nouncement that General Lee had ca
bled for delay received quite as much
attention as the request of Lee. The
debate in progress in the House over
the army reorganization bill attracted
little or no attention. It was complete
ly overshadowed by the more absorb
ing question. Considerable opposition
to the bill developed on the ground that
its provision for an extension of the
regular army in time of war to 104,000
men would be inimical to the National
Guard and the volunteer forces, upon
which the country had heretofore relied
in time of stress. There will be a strong
effort to recommit the bill to-morrow.
When the Senate convened to-day in
tense expectancy, amounting to excite
ment, prevailed both on the flooor and
in the galleries. The President's mes
sage had been positively promised, and
its coming was awaited with genuine
anxiety. Ten minutes after the Sen
ate convened consideration of the sun
dry civil bill was resumed and with the
exception of eight minutes consumed
by executive session, in which Senator
Davis announced that no message
would be sent in to-day, almost the en
tire session was consumed by the ap
propriation bill. it was practically
completed when laid aside for the day
HOUSE RADICALS
TALK OF REVOLT
Members Who Consider Blocking
Legislator) May Be Put in
Position of Bolters.
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington. April 6.
Notwithstanding the impatience and disappointment caused among
Republican members of the House by the withholding of the Presi
dent's message to-day, the frank statement of the President to the
leaders and to several prominent Democrats that such a course was
deemed absolutely necessary by Consul-General Lee to insure the safe
departure of the Americans still In Cuba, has caused them to accept the
situation in good faith. Some of the most radical, after hearing the
statements of those who saw the President, appeared satisfied. Those
with whom the President talked came away with a very strong Im
pression that the message would mean war unless Spain backed down
squarely. Pending the transmittal of the message in view of the situ
ation presented by the President, all plans looking to action in the
House will be abandoned.
But those who have been taking part in the radical movement,
and who always admit the possibility that the time may come when
they will have to part company with the President, are, according to
the leaders of the movement, more determined than ever to ultimately
obtain what they desire. They, however, are at present satisfied with
the assurance they have received as to the character of the message.
But this has not prevented them lrom organizing for possible contin
gencies. The conference which was to have been held to-night was
abandoned, but fifty of those who originally inaugurated the movement
met immediately after the House adjourned to discuss the situation.
All who were not heartily in sympathy with the movement were in
vited to leave. Those at the meeting unanimously agreed to wait
upon the message, but the movement for a caucus started by the Pres
ident's supporters, which was also abandoned during the afternoon, ex
posed them to a danger of which they had not reckoned, namely: That
a caucus of Republicans mieht be called to bind them by the party ac
tion and place them in the position of bolters if the occasion arose
for them to adopt an independent plan of action. A committee of eight
was therefore appointed to count noses, to watch the situation and to
devise ways and means to meet any tactics of the opposition.
The committee is as follows: Hopkins of Illinois, Lorrimer of Illi
nois, Tawney of Minnesota, Cooper of Wisconsin, Hepburn of lowa,
Brownell of Ohio, Joy of Missouri and Knox of Massachusetts.
Several rather vigorous speeches in denunciation of any policy or
delay were made in the course of the meeting, one by Smith of Illi
nois. In order to emphasize this position, a proposition was made to
unite with the Democrats and block all legislation, adjourning from
day to day until the message appeared and the House had acted on the
Cuban resolution. But Hull of lowa, who is pushing the army reor
ganization bill, made such an ardent plea to allow the bill to come to
a vote that the proposition was temporarily abandoned. Whether it
will be revived depends largely upon the course of events. It can be
stated, however, that it is thoroughly contemplated.
One of the other chief developments of the day was the probability,
In the event of a split on the Republican side, that the Democrats
would unite with the radicals and ullow the latter to force the issue.
If the Democrats should assume the aggressive the chances are that
they would solidify the Republicans against them.

HAVANA, April 6.â Panic reigned in
Havana to-night. The cable this morn
ing brought many alarming private
messages, and the result is the city is
in a tumult. Americans are rushing to
get away. Spaniards are scanning the
horizon beyond Morro Castle for the
coming of "the white squadron, whose
presence in Cuban waters is hourly ex
pected. Lawton & Childs, American
bankers and usrents of the Plant line
steamships, received early a message
that the Mascotte should not on any
account be held beyond the sailing
hour of 1 o'clock this afternoon, and
ihat the Olivette would not make the
extra trip that had been promised. This
message also announced that Consul-
General Lee would be ordered to with
draw from Havana to-day. The result
of this message was that Lawton &
Childs did not open their doors for gen
eral business this morning, though
American customers were cared for.
Their action was followed by all other
American houses, and Indeed by most
of the French and German firms, as
well as some Spanish. The shops along
Orellly and Obispo streets wtre desert
ed, while people gathered in excited
knots to discuss the situation.
I went early to the palace to pay re
spects to General Blanco. I found the
doorway to the palace almost choked
with excited officers talking and gestic
ulating. The sentinels at the gate were
not at their posts, but had stepped out
side to talk over the latest news with
half a dozen fello-w soldiers. In the
passage upstairs I found the same con
dition of affairs, save in General Blan
co's room. There a council of war was
being held. Besides Blanco there were
present members of the Colonial Gov
ernment, military and half a dozen
others whose offices I did not know. I
was told that they were Governor Aro
las, Admiral Manterola, General Par
rado and Dr. Congosto. They were dis
cussing the "bando" recalled last night,
and which will be probably reissued to
night, calling upon all able-bodied men
in the island between the ages of nine
teen and fifty to at once enroll them
selves in the army.
This was not a peremptory order, but
so worded that it can be plainly seen
that to refuse it is to be considered dis
loyal to Spain. Of course it was impos
sible under the circumstances for me to
see Blanco or Secretary Congosto, pa
lite regrets with a request to call later
being sent out in reply to my card. Dr.
Mendez, censor, was seen for a mo
ment, but he was too busy to talk. He
is one of the few officials within the
palace who refuses to get excited. Dr.
Mendez has for several weeks believed
war inevitable, but sees northing re
markable in that and has awaited the
end with a smile of confidence. He does
not expect a short war, either, and de
clares that final victory is not assured
to either country.
Nearly every foreign family which ex
pects to remain in Havana has been
prepared for at least ninety days of
siege. My informant said that unles3
robbed by a mob his family has sup
plies sufficient to last ninety days. This
morning not less than 5000 volunteers
were in the Prado in parade, which was
lined with spectators from one end to
the other. Great enthusiasm was dis
played, but absolute order was ob
served. The Hotel Inglaterra is guarded
by fifty mounted orden publicoa and as
, many more on foot.

Reassuring to Seekers
of Peace.
It Is Believed That the Pro
posed Papal Mediation Will
Not Be Accepted.
Ons Correspondent Declares That
Concessions Could Be Secured
if Spain Is Granted Time.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 6.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Times says there is
no definite news, but the situation be
comes more stable in its gravity. The
telegrams from Rome indicate that the
Pope's mediation was indefinite and un
developed and that the assent of all
parties concerned is as yet not accord
ed. It is said, furthermore, that His
Holiness will ask the QueÂ«n Regent to
grant an armistice in Cuba. Her
Majesty may do so, but, as no armistice
is reported to have been asked for from
â the rebel camp, the granting of it will
not be easy. A ministerial crisis is
talked of. ISo crisis of this nature is in
immediate prospect, but the shades of
ministerial opinion are known to con
trast with some sharpness. The Cuban
ministry's message to the insurgents is
thought here to be sailing as close to
the wind as is safe.
El Heraldo of Madrid attacks it with
tooth and nail, and the Ejercito Espa
nole, an organ representing the army,
brings a violent charge against the
colonial minister, Senor Moret, although
adduciner no proof.
With these exceptions the press in
laudably sober and the country sajs
little, but pulls itself together for at
tack and defense. Diplomacy or inter
cession may still, of course, be trumps
and peace may ensue. If it does there
will be much warlike preparations to
unmake, and Spain's estimate of
America, her parliament and President
will have been an error.
The Madrid corespondent of the
Daily Telegraph says: I am able to
â¢assert that, in the opinion of more than
one European Government, a peaceful
settlement on the basis of Spanish con
cessions could be secured if a little time
were allowed for reflection and discus
sion: but the rapidity of events at
Washington is the most dangerous ele
ment of the situation. It is question
able whether the Cubans an? npe for
independence and whether such a
measure could possible be executed in
a hurry.
ARCHBISHOP IRELAND
CABLES INFORMATION.
Tells the Pope That Mediation Is Al
most Impossible Because of the
Resistance of Public Opinion.
LONDON, April 7.â The Rome cor
respondent of the Daily Chronicle says:
Archbishop Ireland has cabled to the
Pope that mediation is almost impos
sible in consequence of the resistance
of public opinion. His Holiness is much
grieved by this check to his good in
tentions.
The Cuban insurgents, it is said, have
cabled to the European committee that
they will not agree to an armistice or
disarmament unless Cuban independ
ence is declared.

Over two hundred reconcentrados who

The details, which have arrived only a

Several officials of the administration
called informally at the White House
to-night and had conferences with the
President. Secretaries Long. Bliss, Al
ger and Attorney-General Grlggs were
among those who saw the President,
but all left the executive mansion early
and the President retired before 11
o'clock. None of them would discusa
the situation in any of its phases.
Early in the evening the President
had a long conference by appointment
with John A. McCall of New York.
Mr. McCall is said to have assured the
President that the Government would
be put to no embarrassment by a lack
of money with which to prosecute a
war. While he deprecated war and
hoped that it might be averted, if it
could not be the whole people of the
country would stand by the President
in maintaining a just contest.
It is said upon excellent authority
that Mr. McCall represented to tha
President the belief that within forty
eight hours he could raise among thÂ»
financial institutions of New York
alone $300,000,000, which the Government
could have upon its own terms and that
if a popular subscription %vere called
for $500,000,000 could be obtained in a
few days.
Late to-night Mr. McCall said he dii
not care to discuss his interview with
the President.
"As to a war loan," said he, "we will
not cross that bridge until we get to
it. Everybody ought to deplore war,
but when the President B&ys war is
inevitable the people will stand solidly
with him. He can have ail the money

PRESIDENT
McKINLEY
Jt Includes Prompt Work
by the Warships Now
in Readiness.
Immediately After Congress
Declares for Intervention the
Fleets Will Commence
Operations.
NEW YORK, April 6.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: President
McKlnley's Intervention programme
contemplates the execution of plans to
bring Spain to compliance with his de
mands before the United States resorts
to the last expedient of war. This plan j
Is nothing more or less than a naval
demonstration to be made Immediately
after Congress passes the resolution au
thorlxlng the Intervention of the United
States to end the war in Cuba. It has
been the subject of serious considera
tlon by the President and his advisers.
The plan has been practically perfected
and when approved will be forwarded
to Commodore Schley, commander-in
chief of the flying squadron, and Cap
tain W. T. Sampson, commander-in
chief of the fleet at Key West, to be :
put Into execution at a word from
Washington.
Of course the plan may be abandoned
by reason of unforeseen events, but
ng at the future with a knowledge
of the situation as it is to day the au- ,
thtirities feel confident that it may j
prove to be the BOluti n of the danger- j
ous Cuban problem, and that by its
â¢ion war may be averted. Spain's
course in case a demand Is made Is
a subject of keen speculation,
but it is evident that the President and
â -â¢his advisers believe that the Madrid
rnment will come . > terms; other
wise they would hardly consider such
a desperate undertaking. With the
American fleet oft Havana harbor and
thÂ« flying squadron at Porto Rico it is
but a step to the discharge of a shot
which will inflame the two countries to
war. But the officials hope that there
will be no first Ehot and that appre
ciating that this Government has the
military situation well in hand Spain
will lose no time in entering into an
armistice with the Insurgents with their
endence to follow.
m ' rer the feeling of Spain
and the Spaniards is well known it is
declared that the United States will
find that Spain will call the President's
..bluff and that war will inevitably fol
low the demonstration. It is an open
.secret that Spain does not propose to
take the initiative in declaring war; it
Is- lier desire that the United States
shall be the offender in that she may
turn to. Europe and represent that the
American Government forced hostilities
upon her because of its desire to re
move European domination from the
western hemisphere.
The President has been extremely
cautious in his diplomatic negotiations,
and now he occupies a position which
the whole world will approve when he
describes it in the message which he
will lay before Congress on Monday
next or as soon as Consul -General Lee
cables that Americans have been re
moved from Cuba, The flying squadron
and the Key West fleet are ready for
Immediate service. The Texas is ex
pected to reach Hampton Roads to
morrow, and with her the flying squad
ron will be complete and ready for
business. Should the squadron be re
tained at Hampton Roads until next
Week it will be joined by the cruisers
San Francisco and New Orleans.
The first step was taken by the au
thorities to-day to put the New Or
leans in commission immediately upon
her arrival at New York by the assign
ment of Lieutenant-Commander A. P.
psborn as her executive officer. Cap
tain W. M. Folger has been ordered to
command this vessel by direction of the
Secretary. A crew for the new cruiser
was forrred at the Brooklyn Navy
Yard and win be placed on board the
vessel at the earliest possible moment.
It is the expectation of officials that the
Newark, which is approaching com
pletion at the Norfolk Navy Yard, will
aJso be attached to the flying squadron,
as it is said that Captain Sampson now
has a sufficiently formidable fleet at
Key West to carry out the programme
which the President has in view. Of
course Captain Sampson's fleet will be
Increased by an auxiliary cruiser,
picket boats, etc., but the line-of-bat
tle ships, vessels which will bJar the
bruni nf action, are all ready for busi
ness. Captain Sampson now has at
Key West the monitors Terror and
Puritan. The Amphitrlte left Charles
ton to-day for Key West, and the Mi
antonomoh will leave League Island to
morrow for the same destination. The
monitors Will be used to bombard the
fortifications of Havana, leaving the
battle-ships and cruisers to operate
the naval force, to follow up
n.iy advantage that may be gained, and
transports loaded with

ban soil.

STRIKE OF GOLD
AT THE HEAD OF
THE DYEA RIVER
Rich Pay-Dirt Has Been Found in the Vicinity
of Canyon City â A Suicide at
Dyea.
SEATTLE, April 6. â The steam schooner Navarro reached here this
morning from Dyea. The officers report that an interesting passenger
left the boat at Fort Wracgei . H- was a full-blooded Indian named
John Johnson, and he had just returned from Dawson with a quantity
of gold dust and several drafts for considerable money.
Johnson is a graduate of the Carlisle Indian School, and afterwari
lived four years in Philadelphia. He came from the East a year ago
and went into Alaska, where he procured an interest in four good
claims. Ho left Dawson early in March, coming down the river alone
with a single train of docs.
Johnson brings the report of a gold strike near the head of the Dyea
River, which promises to be of considerable importance. Purser Wel
chum of the Navarro says that as hip' 1 as 90 cents to the pan has been
taken out a few feet below the surface. Bedrock has not been reached
yet. The strike is near Canyon City, and every foot of ground that
seems at all likely to bear has been staked out.
The news came down to-day from Dyea of the suicide of J. J. Mc-
Greal. He first made an attempt on March 2S to end his life by taking
poison, but he told of what he had done, and a physician applied a
stomach pum- and saved his life. The next day he went out on the trail
and shot himself dead.
McGreal established the messenger service between Skaguay and
Dyea and was doing well. Lately he had been drinki;.? and playing
roulette, gambling with varying success. He got about $300 ahead and
then lost as much of his own money. Finally he put up $150 which be
longed to one of his customers and lost that. His watch and chain fol
lowed.
Crazed by his losses and ashamed to face his friends, he took a
dose of morphine to end his life. He went to his room in the Palace
Hotel and wrote a letter to the proprietor, telling him where he could
secure some valuables belonging to him to reimburse the man he had
betrayed. A hint as to his intention had been dropped, and friends
hunted him up and saved his life. Determined to finish himself, he went
out on the trail and put a ball through his head, from which he almost
instantly died.
A shootin^ affray Is reported from Skaguay. A victim of gamblers
was taunted by them over his losses, with the result that several
knockdowns occurred, followed by a lively exchange of shots. Two men
were injured, but not seriously.

FROM MADRID

Papal Action in Pressing Spain
to Accept the Conditions
of the United States.
Question Whether All the Powers of
Europe Can Induce the Done to
Withdraw From Cuba.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONDON, April 7.â The Rome corre
spondent of the Daily News describ
ing the origin of the statement that
America sought the Pope's mediation
says: This "lie from Madrid," as they
openly call it in the Vatican, has up
set the calculations of the Pope and
may cause the entire ruin of the good
offices of the Pontiff because of the dis
like among Americans of intervention
by the Pope, not only as the head of
the Catholics, but as a European
Prince, as he wishes to be considered,
his actions thus being opposed to the
Monroe doctrine.
It is supposed that Madrid gave this
version to make it appear that the
United States was backing down be
cause unprepared for war. Papal ac
tion now continues in pressing Spain
to accept the conditions of the United
States, and is working Indirectly for
the spread of the peace spirit in Amer
ica, Even at the Vatican, the inde
pendence of Cuba now seems inevita
ble, with or without war.
Can the Pope and the powers which
join him induce Spain to withdraw
peacefully instead of being driven out?
The possibility or not of concluding an
armistice will be the first step toward
the one or the other solution. The Italia
says that Monslgnor Martlnelll, the
Apostolic delegate at Washington, has
cabled to the Vatican that President
McKinley expressed his best wishes for
the success of the Pope In obtaining an
armistice in Cuba, but the President
considers the question, "one between

TESTING NEW
APPARATUS
Cruiser Brooklyn Cleared
for Action During the
Firing.
Commodore Schley and Cap
tain Cook Are Satisfied
With the Results.
Eight-Inch Gun* Do Moat Excellent
Work With the Latest Ele
vating Appliances.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
FORT MONROE, Va., April 7.â The
Brooklyn, flagship of the flying spuad
j ron, tried her 8-lnch guns to-day in
| order to test the new elevating appa- ;
ratus. The test was not made solely |
i to demonstrate the utility of the appa- j
! ratus, but also to see if the turrets, !
. after being so materially changed, ;
j would stand the shock to which they I
! are subjected. The test, which was un- ;
i der the direction of Commodore Schley i
and Captain Cook, was of a most satis- â 
, factory nature and Commodore Schley
i said that the Brooklyn was in the best '
! fighting trim.
At 1 o'clock p. m. the order, "Clear
i ship for action" was given and in thir
\ ty-flve minutes every railing, rope, cap
i stan, anchor, small boat and loose ham
1 per of every kind had been removed,
and the big cruiser stood out grim and
defiant in the sunlight. The guns used
were the forward 8-inch pair and the
firing was under the direction of Lieu-
tenant-Commander Maeon, with Lieu
tenant Rush in command of the turrets.
i Commodore Schley and Captain Cook
stood on the quarter deck to notice the
vibration of the turret, which after
ward was declared to be minimum.
The first shot was sant out with a
service charge of eighty-five pounds of
powder, the gun being elevated only
five degrees. The 200 pound shell left
the muzzle of the gun with a velocity
of 2000 feet a second. It struck the
water two and three-quarter miles
from the ship, sending up a vast col
umn of water. The second shot was
with the full powder charge of 110
pounds and sent the projectile very
nearly four miles putting it in the
water at a speed of 1000 feet a second.
There was no perceptible jarring from
the shot.
Commodore Schley said to-night that
he had not yet received any orders
from Washington.
The New Orleans and the San Fran
cisco have not been assigned to him,
and the dynamite cruiser Vesuvius was
not ordered to his squadron.

LEE TO BE THE
LAST TO LEAVE
Will See That All Ameri
cans Depart From
Havana.
His Cablegram Delaying Inter
vention Approved by Lead
ing Statesmen.
Rumors of Disturbances at the Cuban
Capital Not Confirmed, but Out
breaks Are Threatened.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 6.
The Washington Post's summary of
the situation to be printed to-morrow
morning is as follows:
"The temporary withholding of Pres
ident McKinley's message from Con
gress was due to the receipt of cable
grams from General Fitzhugh Lee, our
Consul-General at Havana, advising
that if the message contemplated arm
ed intervention it be deferred until all
Americans in Cuba could leave the is
land. He stated that the exodus could
be completed by the 10th inst. Mem
bers of the Foreign Affairs committees
of the Senate and House upon being
shown this dispatch promptly concurred
in the opinion of the President and the
Cabinet that the message should be de
layed until next Monday. The utmost
confidence is felt by the administra
tion and Congress in the wisdom and
good Judgment of General Lee in any
emergency. The rumors of disturb
ances in Havana are not confirmed, but
the situation there is extremely threat
ening. Consul-General Lee is still at
his post and will remain there until all
other Americans are safe.
"The President's message has only
been changed in that it will ask Con
gress to authorize and direct Immediate
intervention. Otherwise the message
will stand as heretofore outlined, and
as the Post stated on Tuesday morning
it will be of such vigorous, ringing
character as to meet the full expecta
tions of Congress and the country. It
will 'inevitably mean war.' Hostilities
can only be averted by Spain herself
declaring the independence of Cuba and
yielding her sovereign power over the
island.
"Negotiations with Spain have not
been reopened by the United States and
will not be. The Queen Regent has not
sent a personal message to the Presi
dent, making a new proposal for peace.
With the influence now at work
through foreign diplomatic channels to
bring about a settlement of the diffi
culties between Spain and her rebel
lious subjects in Cuba this Government
has absolutely nothing to do. The ad
ministration and Congress stand
pledged to the freedom of Cuba and
will accept no solution that does not
involve the withdrawal of Spanish
troops from the island and the hauling
down of the Spanish flag.
"The five great powers have not sent
a note jointly to the United States,
counseling against war. Mediation of
any sort has not been offered to this
Government and will not be accepted."
NATIVE SONS ARE
DEEP IN POLITICS
Who Gets the Plums of the
Celebration Committee and
the Grand Parlor.
Two Men Out for tho Committee
ChÂ«irmnr>Â»hlp â The Grand
Ora:or Fight.
Next Saturday evening delegates from
the twenty-one parlors of Native Sons
in this city, three from each, will meet
in the Native Sons' building to prepare
for the celebration of Admission day.
The duty of the joint committee is to
arrange for the transportation and ac
commodation of the members of the lo
cal organizations, and its labors are
purely local. There is one important fea
ture, however, the information which its
committee on transportation will get in
regard to rates to and from the probable
location of the celebration of the order.
Thfl favored city will be chosen by the
Grand Parlor, which will meet in Ne
vada City on the 25th inst., and the work
of the joint committee will have a ma
terial bearing on the selection.
Who will be chairman of the commit
tee is a question already arousing con
siderable interest. So far there are two
men in the fieldâ Charles E. Mosher of
Presidio Parlor and W. J. McCreary of
National Parlor. Both men are popular,
and both claim winning strength. Bob
Martland has been secretary of that
committee for several successive years
and he will get it again this year. The
other offices have brought out no candi
dates up to this time. The appointment
of the sub-committees will rest with the
chairman, and so no one can foretell who
will get the plums. From his position as
superintendent of the hall, Martland will
probably be on the press committee, but
who will get the transportation and par
ade committee chairmanships is an open
question.
Politics of the Grand Parlor meeting is
also rife among the parlors, and the rela
tive merits of about fifty candidates are
being argued pro and con. Judge Conley
of Madera, the first vice, will be made
grand presidentâ custom has made that a
certainty. Custom has also made It a rule
that the grand orator shall come from
the ranks of the trustees, but custom will
receive a setback, for David E. Morgan
of Nevada is going to enter the race
against Frank L. Coombs. Coombs is
considered a winner. Frank Sabichl of
Los Angeles is also out for the place,
but he shows but little strength here in
the city, as yet.
There is also said to be a fight on for
outside sentinel, four aspiring sons having
placed themselves in the office-seekers'
row, but the big fight will be over the
oratorship. There are candidates for
trustee galore, but the fight there will
be general.
LINCOLN'S MONUMENT.
Next Memorial Day May Be Made a
Collection Day for the Fund.
There was a meeting of the general
committee of the Lincoln Monument
League held In the Union League Club
room last evening, at which an interest
ing statement of how the league has
;rown was read.
The statement was a report which will
be read at the department encampment of
the Grand Army of the Republic, to be
held in Nevada City this month. It stat
ed that ia thirteen months the league has
secured WOOO subscribers, and it has $24,
i)9B 6S in cash on hand. â¢ Lincoln Day is
celebrated in* the schools of seventeen
States, and there have been three big
mass meetings held under the league aus-
Dices.
Colonel George Stone was appointed
chairman of a committee to present a res
olution to the encampment, asking that
next Memorial Day be set aside for the
aking of collections in all the posts of
this department, for the benefit of the
monument fund.
TROOPS
NOT FOR
DISPLAY
When Ordered Out It Will
Be to Fight, Says
General Miles.
Plans Arranged by the Navy
and War Departments for
the Landing of Men and
Occupation of Cuba.
NEW YORK, April 6.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: "Orders to
concentrate the military forces of the
United States at Chickamauga and
other points in the South will not be
held many days longer. Detached com
mands of the army are ready to move
on receipt of telegraphic orders and
when orders are given it will be for
immediate and decisive operations."
Major General Miles commanding the
army made this reply to-night to ques
tions of mine regarding the status of
military preparations in anticipation of
a declaration of war. I called General
Miles' attention to reports that the
National Guards of various States are
to be called this week for the purpose
of testing their efficiency and making
a display with the regular army for the
benefit of Spain â a military demonstra
tion of the power of the country to
quickly put an immense armed force
in the field.
General Miles declared that such re
ports are absolutely without founda
tion. He said to me: "When the army
moves and the National Guard is called
out it will be for serious business, not
for experiment and display. The idea
of our exploiting our armed strength as
a man puts on a hideous mask thinking
somebody will run away in fear is pre
posterous. The situation is most seri
ous. Both Spain and the United States
are making heroic preparations for war.
There is nothing in the situation to lead
one to think war can be avoided. It is
expected and prepared for, for war is
probably near at hand. The next orders
to troops will be for a general move
ment for active service in the South and
on the coast. They may not be issued
until the effect of the President's mes
sage to Congress on Monday has de
cided our position. Of course if the
situation in the meantime should take
a more serious turn troops would move
immediately."
As previously stated In the Herald,
all the troops east of Denver are fully
prepared to move in any direction at
an hour's notice. The general plans of
the War Department contemplate a
concentration of the greater part of
the regular military force and of Na
tional Guards which may be called out
at Chickamauga Park, Term.
Detachments of t th infantry and
cavalry will be distributed at the prin
cipal sea coast points to support the ar
tillery against hostile landing parties.
Troops at the general rendezvous will
undergo a constant and thorough drill
in tactics, and from the concentrated
force will be selected regiments con
sidered the best adapted to do effective
work in Cuba, All regular troops are
fitted for this service barring only
their liability to become incapacitated
by the climate and disease of Cuba.
National Guards will be subjected to
thorough inspections to determine their
varying degrees of efficiency. As many
trained colored troops as possible, both
regulars and militia, 'will be utilized on
account of the immunity from evil ef
fects of the Cuban climate.
When the picked troops have been
finally selected and drilled as a homo
geneous organization the plans for the
reduction of Havana will be quickly
carried into effect. From fifty thousand
to sixty thousand troops, in transports
that will be ready to receive them at
gulf ports selected for points of em
barkation, will cross the gulf under
convoy of battleships and cruisers now
in the vicinity c f Key West. It will rest
with the military and naval authorities
to select a port of embarkation accord
ing to conditions existing at the time
the expedition is ready. The choice will
He between Tampa. Pensacola and Mo
bile. A comprehensive plan of cam
paign against Ha .ana has been pre
pared. Its details are necessarily
guarded with the greatest secrecy. In
general it contemplates a naval block
ade of Havana and land siege by
United States troops which will take
station In the rear of the city. Several
batteries of field artillery will be en
trenched in a commanding position,
supported by infantry and cavalry.
Provisions ample to support the troops
for many weeks will have been trans
ported and communication with Key-
West and Tampa will be established
with dispatch boats. Should the Span
ish fortifications and military force at
Matanzas be sufficient to be a menace
to the conduct of the siege of Havana
the former city will be taken care of
in the general plan in advance of the
main movement upon Havana, Co
operation by Cuban insurgents is an
ticipated, but is not relied upon as a
necessary element in the situation.

HAS SAVED THE WHALERS
Third Officer of the Belvidere the
Bearer of Reassuring
News.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, April 6.â G. F. Tilton, J
third officer of the whaler ship Belve- j
dere, now frozen in northern waters
rear Point Barrow, arrived in Portland
to-day on the steamship Albion. He ]
Bays he has eighteen typewritten pages
of h!s ship's log, which were copied for j
him by a friend at St. Michael, but he j
Is imbued with the idea that his story
is worth a fortune and will say very j
little about his trip. However, he de- |
nies the report that he knows anything
about Andree. His story merely re
lates to the Bufferings of his fellow
seamen and the condition of the fleet \
â when he left it. He came down from
the ship with dogs, and, when asked
what became of them, two big tears
sprang to his eyes as he said:
"They froze to death. "
W'nh Tilton were K. Klotchoff. guide
of the expedition under Lieutenant Jar- j
vis that was sent on the revenue cutter j
Bear last fall to rescue the whalers, and
two natives, a man and a woman, who
came from Northwestern Alaska with â 
Tilton and Klotchoff. The men could
not keep their mouths wholly closed
on their voyage down, which occupied
ten days, and to the officers of the j
Fhip and to passengers they dropped j
remarks that gave some indication of j
their mission.
It whs about the middle of October
that Tilton left his ship with the best
equipment he could get and started
alone to travel nut overland from the
Icebound whaling fleet in the Arctic
Ocean. His object was to reach St.
Michael, about GOO miles southwesterly.
He picked up the native couple to assist
him on the trip, and very important
service was rendered by them.
After being out several weeks they
happened to run across the party s^nt
by the Government to rescue thewhal
ers. That meeting is understood to
have been much nearer Cape Hope
than Point Barrow, which indicated
that the routo traversed was governed
5n some degree by the coast line rather
than being across the country. The re
lief party gave Tilton what "he needed

SETTLERS FLEE
FROM THE BASE
OF ST. HELENS
Smoke and Sulphurous Gases
Pouring From the Crater
in Greater Volume.
TACOMA, April 6.â Smoke and sulphurous gases are pouring from one
crater and the great crack on the north side of Mount St. Helens, sit
uated eighty miles southeast of this city. They were observed yes
terday morning by ranchers living on the north and west sides of the
mountain. For four hours before clouds obscured their vision dark
smoke was seen rising in great volumes, bearing evidence of probably
greater eruptions to follow. A southwest wind blew the smoke to the
northeast toward Mount Tacoma.
Yesterday afternoon settlers began arriving at Castle Rock, bring
ing reports of the eruption. Some of them came within fifteen
miles of the mountain's base, where smoke was seen as plainly as
though coming from some great chimney near by. The odor of sul
phurous fumes was in the atmosphere. At noon yesterday clouds
came up and the smoke could be seen no longer.
Reports from Castle Rock this evening state that it has been cloudy
all day. More settlers have reached there and others are going to To
ledo, on Cowlitz River. They will remain in these towns for a few days
at least, being fearful of violent seismic disturbances or showers of
ashes which would cover their farms. Castle Rock is thirty miles
west of Mount St. Helens.
St. Helens has long been known as the most violent of the sup
posedly extinct volcanoes in the Cascade Range. Its Indian name is
"Lah-Me-Lat-Cla," meaning "Fire Mountain." Indians are living who
have seen fire and lava issuing from its craters. All Northwestern
Indians are afraid of it, and, excepting Chief George Leschl, who as
cended it five years ago, they cannot be persuaded to go within fif
teen miles of it. Indians on the south side of the mountain who saw
yesterday's smoke are reputed to be moving down into Klickitat
County.
In 1543 and 1854 St. Helens threw clouds of ashes to The Dalles, fifty
miles away. It broke into eruption on November 23. 1843, burning until
February 16, 1544. Dense masses of smoke rose from the craters and
at night the mountain's top was brilliantly illuminated. This pro
gramme was repeated for several days early in 1854. In August, IS3I,
ash clouds thrown out made the day as dark as night for forty miles
around, except for a slightly lurid appearance. The atmosphere was
filled with ashes for days after, and fires out of doors burned with a
bluish flame, as though mixed with sulphur. When the ash clouds
cleared away the snow on the mountain sides was found to be brown
with ashes. At that time lava was emitted.
St. Helens is 9750 feet high. Its two craters are on the north side,
2000 feet below the summit. Near them Is a huge fissure, through which
came part of the smoke of yesterday.
ATTACKED HIM
WITH AN AX
Sensational Allegations in
a San Rafael Divorce
Suit.
George W. McMillan Tells of
Alleged Cruelties of His
Wife.
An Unhappy Husband, Who Dodged
a Clock Sent Flying Toward
H:s Head.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL, April 6.â ln a com
plaint for divorce filed to-day in County
Clerk Thomas S. Bonneau's office by
George W, McMillan against Annie J.
McMillan, a story of domestic troubles
of a strange character is revealed. The
plaintiff, George W. McMillan, was, un
til a few days ago, the proprietor of a
San Rafael photographic gallery. Mi 3.
McMiiian Is connected with one of San
Francisco's best families.
The couple were married in Oregon
about twelve years ago and have two
children. Their wedded bliss was brief.
As weeks grew into months and months
into years a change came and Mr. and
Mrs. McMillan frequently quarreled.
The husband accused the wife of being
unfaithful. She, the complaint alleges,
would display an uncontrollable temper
and proceed to demolish everything
within sight. Furniture, crockery,
glass and even the clocks were use-1
as weapons and after the scene was
over the wreckage would lie about in
heaps upon the floor.
One scene is described by McMillan
to support his allegations of cruelty.
He alleges that while engaged in taking
a flash-light picture at one time he ro
ceived severe burns and when his wife
saw him in his suffering condition she
added to his woes by throwing a clock
at his head and threatening to kill him.
Not satisfied with this display she at
tempted to pour coal oil over his bod
and apply a match for the purpose o"
burning him.
From bad to worse the domestic
troubles of the photographer and his
wife went until in March, 1597, the wife
started in to wreck his place of busi
ness, and when he interfered she
turned about and assaulted him. In
February of the present year, so the
complaint alleges, Mrs. McMillan made
another attempt to wreck the photo
graph gallery, and succeeded in smash
ing a huge glass picture frame.
On March 15. 189S, Mrs. McMillan
changed her tactics, and instead of her
fists as a weapon she procured an ax
and made threats to use it upon her
husband. On the following day she
carried out her threats by wielding the
ax in an artistic manner, wrecking
everything in reach. The blade of the
ax made inroads upon the furniture,
and she proceeded to chop the bedstead
into splinters, finally ending up by
making an assault upon the mattress
with the ax.
Upon this showing the photographer
has applied to the Superior Court for
a decree of divorce. The summons in
the case was served and filed to-day,
insuring a prompt trial.
FORCED TO THE WALL.
The praln firm of Jonas Erlanger & Co..
doing business at 308 Davis street, has
failed through speculation In various
forms. The direct cause of the failure
was the sale and purchase of several
grain contracts by the caller yesterday,
under the rules of the Produce Exchange
Call Board Association. Erlanger, who,
despite the "C 0.." is the only member of
the firm, happened to be on the wrong
side of the deal and was forced to the
wall.
Mr. Erlanger stated last evening that
his indebtedness is only to two men, who
have perfect confidence In him and would
be willing to cancel the indebtednesss if
the debtor were willing.
"I have been In the business for six
years." said Erlanger, "and my lntegrity
is well known. This is the first time I
have been embarrassed financially. I may
find to-morrow that I shall be able to
pay all I owe. and I may find that I
shall be able to pay only a part. J shall
do the best I can. It just happened that
I was on the wrong side of the specula
tive deal and happened to get 'cinched.'
I do not care to say until to-morrow how
much 1 owe or wbo axe my creditors."

REVIV ES CROPS
Welcome Showers Fall
Throughout Central
California.
San Joaquin Valley Spared
From a Total Grain
Failure.
Beet Fields Around Suisun Greatly
Benefitea by the Down
pour,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SUISUX, April 6.-The long-looked
j for rain came last night and up to 10
i o'clock this morning .40 of an inch had
i fallen at Suisun. Ordinarily this would
: not be considered of much consequence,
I but at this time it was sufficient to
cause the fears of farmers to be allayed.
; With occasional showers from this time
I on fair crops of grain will be assured
| in most sections of Solano County. On
I some ranches, however, the rain came
! too late to be of any benefit. This is
particularly the case along the southern
portions of the Montezuma hills, where
a failure of grain crops has heretofore
been almost unknown. In the central
portion of this farming district the
prospects indicate that there will be a
fair crop if occasional showers occur
during the remainder of this month.
The rainfall there last night was .34 of
an inch.
Rain came in the right time for sugar
beets, about 500 acres having been
planted in this vicinity during the past
two weeks. The showers of last Satur
day caused the seed to sprout and, the
rains of the past twenty-four hours will
give the beets a good start.
Fruit prospects in Suisun Valley are
much better than was anticipated just
after the recent severe frosts. While
It is true that great damage resulted
to both the apricot and almond
crops, it was not as bad as was at first
feared. A careful Inspection of the val
ley shows that instead of apricots be
inp- a total failure, there will be about
a sixth of the crop on an average,
while in orchards in the elevated parts
of the valley present indications point
to full crops. While some damage re
sulted to other varieties of fruit it is
thought the yield this year will be up
to the average of former years. Tak
ing It as a -whole, with the exception of
those whose entire orchards are de
voted almost entirely to apricots and
almonds (and these are decidedly few)
the prospects for remunerative returns
are excedingly goou at the present
time.
MARYSVILLE, April 6.â The un
easinpss resulting from the long dry
spell and the inroad upon crops by hot
north winds was relieved last night
when there was a precipitation of .34
of an inch. To-day nearly as much
more fell in showers. Owners of pas
ture land, where Southern California
stock has been placed, are jubilant
SANTA BARBARA, April 6â Owing
to the want of pasturage in this coun
ty, due to lack of rainfall, stockmen
are sending their stock to other sec
tions for pasturage. J. C. Wilson will
send 200 horses to Inyo- County. Su
pervisor de la Cuesta of Santa Ynez in
tends transporting his stock to San
Bernardino County, where he has se
cured 500 acres of irrigated pasture
land.
STOCKTON. April 6.â The rainfall
here early this morning was .25 of an
inch, making the total for the season
6.03 inches, against 12.71 inches at this
time last year. The shower was very
beneficial to all sections of this county
and in the northern end of the county
the fall was much heavier. There the
crops are in fine condition and will
yield well. San Joaquln County will
have considerable grain from the east
ern section, and along the Mokelumne
River there will be large cr^s. Some
of the reclaimed lands also will pro
duce good crops.
AUBURN. April 6.â Half an inch of
rain fell last night, with occasional
showers throughout the day. It proved
a blessing to farmers, as grain was be
ginning to turn yellow from the north
ern winds and the continued dryness.
SANTA CRUZ, April 6.â There was a
heavy shower of rain here last night.

SAN QUENTIN PRISON, April 6.â
Wearing pinned to the lapel of his coat
a tiny sprig of geranium taken from a
bunch of flowers sent to him yesterday
by his boy, Benjamin L. Hill, the cool
est and bravest man who has ever suf
fered death upon the San Quentin gal
lows, was executed this morning at
10:33 o'clock, in the presence of a small
party, compose^ for the most part of
newspaper men and prison officials.
Ten minutes after the trap door was
sprung and Hill shot into eternity the
doctors pronounced life extinct and the
corpse was cut down, lowered into a
coffin and sent to his relatives.
Hill's neck was broken immediately
and but three respirations were re
corded. His pulse after five minutes
became too faint to be perceptible and
exactly ten minutes after the drop his
heart ceased to beat.
Hill's last hours were in no way out I
of the ordinary. He retired at about 11 j
o'clock last night and slept five hours.
Arising at an early hour he sat at the
table in the death chamber and wrote
a number of letters to frier Is and rela
tives. Not once id he exhibit a trace
of fear. During the morning he was
visited by Chapiain Drahms and Staff
Captain George Keid of the Salvation
Army. The ministers were with the
condemned man when Warden Hale en
tered the death chamber to read the i
death warrant. Hill waived this for- (
mality and after bidding him good-by I
Warden Hale withdrew from the cham- '
ber and the prisoner was prepared for j
the gallows.
His arms were strapped to his sides
and at 10:30 the procession started for .
the execution chamber. Chaplain â 
Drahms led the way, closely followed
by Captain Keid. Hill walked behind
them, between Amos Lunt, the hang- I
man, and Guard Jvjnes of the deith
watch. Guard Abrogast brought up the j
rear. There was not a sign of timidity I
on the part of Hill. His face was kindly j
and almost smiling.
Warden Hale announced that Hill i
had a few words to say and the con- j
demned man stepped forward and fac- i
ing the spectators spoke in a low tone.
Said he:
"I testify to-day to the great saving !
and healing power of Jesus Christ. I :
have been a great sinner, but, praise j
the Lord. I have a great Savior. I
am about to suffer for my crime just
ly. 1 am guilty. This has caused me
great sorrow, but I have placed my
dependence in Jesus' hands and I am j
satisfied. He helps us in all circum- j
stances. For a year and a half I have
been in almost solitary confinement and j
he has kept me. I recommend you all
to Jesus. I am this minute satisfied.
As soon as I leave this body I will be
with Jesus. He is a great Savior."
As he finished, a smile overspread
his features and he stepped back onto â 
the trap. Amos Lunt placed the rope j
around his neck and Hill leaned over,
and before the blackcap was drawn
over his head kissed the cheek of Chap
lain Drahms. The chaplain held one
of Hill's hands while Captain Reid held
the other. The rope was drawn tight
and the signal given.
Through the trap the body shot and
Hill had paid the penalty. Not a move
ment was perceptible.
Hill's crime was committed on a
street of Oakland on January 11, 1596,
when he shot his wife in cold blood
after she had confessed infidelity. He
was tried and convicted and sentenced
to be hanged. Appeals were taken and
the Governor was asked to interfere,
but while delays owing to legal pro
ceedings were obtained, Hill has fin
ally died upon the scaffold and satis
fled the demands of the law.
Born in Wisconsin, he was 37 years
old, strong, healthy and stout, weigh
ing about 200 pounds. After his con
finement in Murderer's Row he evinced
a great interest in religion and among
the murderers condemned to die he
organized a Bible class, probably the
strangest one of its kind that ever ex
isted. When Hill was brought to trial
he set up the plea of insanity, but was
duly convicted of murder.
His friends waged a gallant fight for
his life and great influence was brought
to bear on the Governor to commute
his sentence to life imprisonment.
TO AID PBINTERS.
Carpenters' District Council Offers a
Helping Hand to the Strikers.
At a meeting of the Carpenters 1 Dis
trict Council last night it was unani
mously decided that the heartiest sympa
thy be extended the printers in their
struggle for a nine-hour day, and that
the Council would aid the cause in any
and every way within its power. The
District Council is a central body in
which all the Carpenters' Unions in the
city are represented, and its support will
undoubtedly be of great assistance to the
strikers.
An effort will be made to increase the
membership of the Carpenters' Unions
and increase enthusiasm as much as pos
sible. To further this the District Coun
cil is planning to hold a series of weekly
meetings open to all carpenters, where
trade matters will be freely discussed
and the value of a working card from the
Building Trades Council particularly em
phasized. While there has been no no
ticeable falling off, the unions have not
grown as rapidly as has been desired, and
it will be the object of these meetings
not only to bring in outsiders, but to
awaken members to a fuller realization
of their duty.

dock. The leak is thpught to be due to
some defective pipe in her boiler-room.

Boss Rea of San Jose Hits
Upon a New Form
of Slander.
Tries to Injure a Candidate by
Accusing Him of Remarks
Which Were Never
Uttered.
SAN JOSE, April 6.â "Jim" Rea made use of the City Board of Educa
tion to-day in an attempt to injure one of the candidates on the New Char
ter Club ticket. Pie first caused a f^lse report to be spread that W. E.
Crossman, the Charter Club candidate for Councilman in the First Ward,
had stated at one of the tent meetings held by the Charter Club in the Sec
ond Ward that the school teachers, as well as other employes of the city,
were compelled to pay an assessment of $12 50 a month each for political
purposes. Utilizing this report, Rea caused a special meeting of the Board of
Education to be held. Instead of undertaking to make an investigation of
this startling report, and without even an attempt to examine Mr. Cross
man, the Board of Education proceeded to adopt the following remarkable
resolution:
Whereas, It has come to the Board of Trustees of the public

ticket supported by such politicians, or else lose their positions, and that
euch rumors are spread over the city and openly asserted by W. E. Cross

ticket, and such rumors, whether true or false, tending to the injury of the
public schools of this city; now, therefore, be it

E. H. WEMPLE, President. M. J. GRAHAM.
J. R. O'BRIEi.. CHARLES KENYON.
In an interview published in the News, the afternoon "gang" organ,
Charles Kenyon, a member of the Board of Education, had this to say of the
affair:
'â¢I don't think it was necessary for the Board of Education to take any
action upon a mere campaign romance, but I have had a score of messages
by telephone this morning from the teachers in the various grades of the
schools, who are anxious that the statement should be either substantiated
or denied; they declare that they are all under a cloud until the matter is
cleared. It is for this reason that the board decided to hold a meeting this
afternoon and take up the matter."
W. E. Crussman, when his attention was called to the article in the
News and the action of the board, made the following statement:
"There is not one word of truth in the entire article. I never made any
statement either at the meeting held in the Second Ward, or at any other
time, that any fund was being raised by teachers in this city. What I did
say was that a friend of mine, a business man whom I had every reason to
believe, said to me that a lady teacher came to him and asked him to vote
for eight men of the appointing board as a personal favor to her. As an
argument she stated to him that in case the Charter Club nominees of the
appointing board were elected she would lose her position.
"I then continued my speech by saying that at no time, In a meeting of
the Charter Club, or of the members of the Charter Club, or of gentlemen
who had been selected as candiates for the apnointing board by the
Charter Club, had any Euch proposition been spoken of â that is the
dropping of any teacher or any employe of the city who was compe
tent to fulfill his or her duties to the city. Further than that, it has been
the expressed wish of every candidate of the New Charter Club that every
faithful employe of the city be retained in his position, no matter how that
position was obtained, or through whom.
"I stated further at that meeting that if the citizens oi this city would
elect the candidates of the New Charter Club no employe of the city would
in future be held up and be obliged to do homage to any human being.
"The Evening News, which published the false statement this afternoon,
did not even take the trouble to send to me to inquire whether it was
truthful or not, and has thus shown by its attack upon me its entire sub
serviency to the 'gang' and to the disreputable policy pursued by those peo
ple in their efforts to again secure control of the city government of San
Jose."
On being asked if he could name the men whom the school teacher
wished his friend to vote for as members of the appointing board Mr.
Grossman replied that he could, and ga\'e the following as the names of
those whom the teacher had evidently been instructed by the "gang" to
work for: P. P. Austin, A. G. Bennett, H. Booksin Sr., Rush McComas, J.
K. Secord, Francis E. Spencer, Frank Stock and C. D. Wright. It will be
noted that this confirms the statement published in The Call on Tuesday
to the effect that the "gang" has decided to sacrifice six of its candidates
nominated for the appointing board. Those who are to get the knife In their
back at the hands of the "gang" are Milton Campbell, E. ,E. Chase, A. G.
Col, H. J. Fikes, D. Hatman and John Leffler.
It is such dastardly methods as that described in the foregoing that have
brought the "gang" into general detestation and the city of San Jose into
disrepute. There is but one way to eradicate these men and with them
their methods; it is by the election of the Charter Club ticket from Mayor
to the last member of the appointing board.
In the present contest for good government the people of San Jose are
making a final and decisive test of the momentous question: Shall San
Jose be governed by the "gang" and permeated with corruption, or shall
it be governed by the people honestly and economically?
This is no campaign merely for office and for spoils. It is a war be
tween corrupt forces and those that stand for honesty, decency, progress and
prosperity.
Never before have the anti-gang people been so thoroughly united, so
amply equipped with the ammunition of political warfare, so completely
organized, so enthusiastic and so energetic. In no previous campaign has
the outlook for success been so promising. The period of education during
this campaign has been a long one &nd every salient fact showing where
corruption lies, who is responsible for it and what the effect of its exist
ence has been on San Jose, its people and its interests have been fully stat
ed in the columns of The Call. Whoever has desired to become posted on
the actual conditions has been given every facility to do so.
No attempt has been made on the part of the "gang," either through
its local organ or by means of its adherents, to deny these important facts:
That the city government of San Jose is infested by a horde of corrupt
taxeaters; that these vampires on the body politic hold their positions
through the influence and efforts oof Boss Kea and his gang; that they
are absolutely under control of the boss; that they have fattened their
purses at the expense of the taxpayer; that this has caused a high tax
rate and an unfairly high valuation of assessable property; that by reason
of these last mentioned facts capital and population have been deterred
from coming to this city, and that in consequence stagnation, if not retro
gression, has resulted.
In the face of these undeniable and undenied facts the boss and his
"gang," who alone are responsible for all the evils in public affairs of which
the people complain, have had the temerity to. concoct in star-chamber and
offer to the people a complete ticket o2 candidates for city offices. This
ticket they have masked with the name of "People's Municipal Ticket." On
that ticket, it is true, are the names of several men who stand high in this
community as men of ability and integrity. But their selection is but the
result of tactics adopted by all corrupt political bosses when the people
have been aroused to action. The political hook is concealed with the most
tempting bait obtainable. Despite the individual standing of some of the
men on the "gang" ticket, it is a fact, nevertheless, that every candidate on
that ticket can be shown to be under obligation, either directly or indirect
ly, to the political boss of this city and of this county, and to be, therefore,
under his control. No man on that ticket, if elected, but will be amenable
to the orders or influence of "Jim" Rea.
As has been before stated, this is not a campaign of candidates. The
issue is in no sense a personal one. It is a campaign of principle to decide
whether the "gang" shall be allowed to remain in power or whether it shall
be defeated and San Jose released from the thralldom of bossism.
If the people desire to achieve victory â to obtain honest government,
economical administration, low taxes, enhancement of property values, in
creased capital, population and prosperity â they must vote for the entire
Charter Club ticket, at whose head stands the name of Sanford E. Smith.
Among the charter provisions is one that fixes the tax rate at $1 on the
$100. The present tax rate is $1 25 on the $100. It is claimed by the "gang"
that this limitation on the tax rate will prevent the imposition of past ex
tortion in the collection of taxes and extravagance in their disbursement
They are using the fact of this limitation to further their cause. Such a
thing as a tax-rate limit has never yet been known to prevent a "gang" of
corruptionists from bleeding the tax-payers. They usually find it an easy
matter to adhere to the tax limit and equally easy to raise the assessed
valuation of the property to be taxed. Should the "gang" by any possible
misfortune or accident again secure control of the city government the peo
ple will be cinched just as cruelly as they have been in the past twenty
years.

On December 15 Lee revealed to the

-that it was desirable to k^ep the secret
as closely as possible. They charged
achlne with those ingredients, put

being quite ready, It was agreed
that they should go back next morning
Ight up. On presenting themselves
the following morning It was reported
that snme of the charge had leaked, and
it the generator had been taken away
to be repaired. In order that there
should be no suspicion It was decided
to exhaust that charge, and begin de

the place on fire.
The machine was repaired, more
chemicals were purchased and another
trial given. It was then fully demon
strated that the machine would not do
what Lee and Elliott claimed for it
with the Ingredients used, but that the
addition of a very expensive oil gave
the desired result. It was then decided
to put detectives on the trail of the
swindlers, but the birds had flown.
With their wives they went to Auck
land, New Zealand, on the steamer
Ellngamite. From there they went to
Wellington, New Zealand, and joined
the steamer A. .angi, under the names
of Mr. and Mrs. Edmonds, Mr. and Mrs.
Waterfield and Mr. Williams. The
police at Victoria, 13. C, were waiting
for the swindlers - hen the Aorangi

on the lookout when the Moana reached
San Francisco last month, but the quin
tet were safe from pursuit in Hono

"It was one of the cleverest swindles
ever perpetrated in Austrc.ia," said one
of the officers of the Alameda yester
day. "People were breaking their necks
to get shares in the concern and the
directors gobbled up 48 shares of
the unallotted stock before the other
shareholders could get a chance. The
swindled stockholders a^ked the New
South Wales Government to extradite
the swindlers, but the premier replied
something: like this: 'Gentlemen, it
cost us $25,000 to extradite Butler and
he was guilty of murder and was with
out money and without friends. Now
we know these men have $15,000 at least
and plenty of friends in the States, so
how much do you think It will cost us
to extradite them? A great leal more
than the Governmen' will spend. Gen
tlemen, we can do nothing for you.'
That was the last heard of extraditing.
"The last hoard from the swindlers
was that on their arrival in California
they were going to strike out for the
Klondike with a gold-savin? apparatus
which is going to revolutionize gold
mining. If it is anything like their at
mospheric gas it must be a great inven
tion." ___________^^^^
OFFICERS UNDER
EXAMINATION.
Gave Their Testimony in the
Haynes Murder Case
Yesterday.
The Prosecution Has Submitted and
the Delense Will Have an
Inning Saturday.
The police investigation In the Haynes
case was resumed yesterday morning be
fore Judge Conla,n, and after testimony
has been given by many witnesses the
prosecution submitted the case, and at
the request of Attorneys Wilson and
Sweeney for the defense an adjournment
was taken until Saturday morning. Dur
ing the afternoon session the various of
ficers who were on the scene at the time
of the shooting explained the movements
on the fatal morning.
William Cole, a young boy, was the first
witness called, and he was followed by
Ktnil Ott, another lad, who proved to be
the best witness yet called from the
standpoint that he nad seen the whole
affair, and in a straightforward manner
told all the circumstances surrounding
the case. The principal point elicited
from the witness waa the statement that
Officer Merchant had fired a shot before
Lieutenant Burke had fallen to the
ground fatally wounded at the feet of
Merchant, who then fired at Haynes.
i'Mer Duffy was the last witness called
prior to the testimony given by Officers
Kennedy, Merchant, Marlowe and Wil
kinson, who in turn explained the shoot
ing, but the testimony given by each of
the officers was at variance with that
previously given. It was stated by Borne
that Burke had fired three shots before
he fell and then emptied his pistol at
Haynes, hut the others were not certain
as to the shooting, but thought no more
than three shots had been lired by the
injured man.
The sensation of the day was when Pa
trol Driver Cashel went upon the stand,
but nothing new was elicited from his
testimony and no questions were askod In
cross-examination. Sergeant Colby iden
tified the revolvers and cartridges as the
ones taken from the cabin on the day of
the tragedy, and the case was submitted
by the prosecution.
During the examination Chief Lees
from time to time prompted Prosecuting
Attorney Mogan as to the points which
he wished to have brought to the atten
tion of the Judgn. After Officer Kennedy
had been examined the prosecuting attor
ney stated that he was unable to see
where any cowardice had been shown,
and thought the witness should be com
mended for his bravery, but Attorney J.
N. E. Wilson said that he understood
Haynes was being tried for murder and
that he was not aware the case was for
the trial of the officers for cowardice.
While Wilkinson was being examined
the attorney for the State clapped his
hands sharply for the purpose of illus
trating the rapidity with which the
shots were fired, and as he did so the
large curtain on the window came down
with a thud, which caused Chief Lees,
the attorneys and the witness to dodge
with one accord, as the illustration was
realistic, aided by the inanimate curtain.
The case will be resumed Saturday morn
ing at 11 o'clock.

i The steamer Alameda reached port yes
terday from Sydney and Auckland via
Honolulu, making her first trip under the
new mail schedule, which requires the
run to bo made from Auckland here in
nineteen days. The steamer took twenty
throe days coming from Sydney and six
days seven hours from Honolulu. North
of the equator, especially according to
Purser Thomas Smith, the vessel en
countered fierce northwest trade winds
for eight days, accompanied by heavy
seas, but the voyage after that was very
pleasant. Ninety-five boxes of gold bul
lion, amounting to about $2,345,000, were
brought up from the Colonies, the bullion
being mostly consigned to the Anglo-
Califoriiian and the London, Parts and
American bonks.

cabin and % steerage passengers. Many
of them were without staterooms, so
large was the list, and thlrty-flvo pros
pective passengers at Honolulu had to be
turned away for lack of accommodation.
Fifty of those on board are bound for
the Klondike.
The purser says he never saw so many
celebrities take passage on the steamer
at one time before. Among them were
T. B. Cusack-Smith, late British Consul-
General at Apia, Samoa, who has been
promoted to the same i*>sition at Val

Mohican, who took passage at Honolulu;
W. <J. L. Spowers, editor of the Mel

known Honolulan planter; Mr. Kennedy
of the firm of Kennedy & Fitch, who own
a line Of ships plying between there and
Tahiti; Dr. Vondersteinan, the celebrated
scientist, and William Signal, president
of the Marine Engineers' Association of
Australia. Mr. Signal was mot at the
wharf by a delegation from the Marine
Engineers' Association of San Francisco.
He is going to England on a visit and
departed for the East last night on the
overland.
Monday evening the starboard side of
the vessel was covered with a canvas
awning and Captain Van Oterendorp gave
the cabin, passengers a grand ball. In
testimonial of their courtesy during the
voyage the passengers gave Chief Officer
Rennie and Purser Smith a testimonial
and a purse. The testimonial wad signed
by all the cabin passengers.
The Alanieda brought advices to the
effect that the steamer Cape Otway ar
rived at Honolulu March 2'j with 203 pas-
Bengers. all bound for the Klondike. The
vessel docked for one day and was sup
posed to Ball on the 30th for Victoria, but
the officers Of the Alameda do not be
lieve she got away so soon. Several
ladies were on board. It is believed that
the passengers will all be landed In Dyea
in nl.uut two weeks.
The steamer Mary Bldwell also sailed
for Alaska yesterday with seventeen
passengers on board, all shareholders.
They have secured certain special privi
leges for traveling on the Yukon and
other concessions enjoyed by few whose
bourne is the Alaskan gold lields. Among
the number was ex-Lieutenant George
W. Bennett, who resigned from the police
force last Monday In order to make the
trip as a representative of Judge- Camp
bell, one of the shareholders. The vessel
departed early In the afternoon.
The steamer Umatilla took over 800
passengers north yesterday, many of
whom will go to the Klondike. The little
schooner Thomas S. Negus, which re
turned to port last Sunday on account of
forgotten supplies, sailed also for Alaska
yesterday with the party she brought
here from New Haven.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Zeal
andia sailed for Honolulu yesterday at 2
p. m. from Pacific-street wharf. There
were forty-one cabin passengers who un
dertook the trip. In leaving her dock the
vessel scraped too close to the piling and
tore about four feet off the top of one
of the piles, splintered the face of others
and lost two deadlights on Ihe port side.
If great preeer.ee of mind had not been
manifested by her officers greater dam
age would have been done, both to the
steamer and to the wharf. Dr. Milan
Soule, the ship's surgeon, took sick early
in the morning and was unable to leave
on the steamer, Dr. C. H. Lowell, the
'â¢long, slim doctor" of the Harbor Hos
pital force taking his place.
"Swittwater Bill's" Alaskan company
did not get away on the steamer Hum
boldt yesterday, according to schedule
All day the steamer lay at Washington
etreet wharf taking on freight, of which
there will be about 300 tons. Bill's party
of thirty-seven will take along about
ninety tons of provisions, eleven head of
mules and horses and sixty dogs. About
twenty of these were tethered In various
spots around the wharf and made tlio day
hideous with their howling, to the evi
dent discomfort of the female contingent
who will take passage. There will be
about 150 passengers in all on the steamer
Departure was delayed by the fact that
not all of Swlftwater's provisions could
be got aboard In time. It is expected
that the steamer will 6ail to-day at 1 p
m. William himself is looked for to join
the expedition at Victoria.
The British tramp steamer Mount Ta
bor arrived yesterday morning from Hak
odate with a cargo of sulphur, consigned
to the Pacific Stoam Whaling Company.
She has been running between Portland
and Yokohama and will soon return to
the land of the Mikado. This Is her first
trip to San Francisco.
About fifteen or twenty cows managed
to create a deal of excitement along the
water front yesterday afternoon. They
â¢were brought down in the steamer Gold
from Petaluma and were to be sent to
Oakland by the creek route. As there is
a municipal law forbidding the driving of
cattle in certain districts of the city be
tween specified hours the ones handling
the consignment hired water front
"bums" at the rate of a dime apiece
to lead the cows. When they got mixed
up with the cars and heavy traffic on
East street there was a stampede and a
"hot time." The cows ran upon the side
walks and into pedestrians, causing
everybody to tal-re leg bail and the ladies
to scream with fright. One horseman
took after an especially vicious cow that
ran up East street toward the seawall
and was thrown from his steed at the foot
of Jackson street, but luckily escaped
serious injury. The cows were finally
corralled and got out of the center of
trade, after Sergeant Mahoney and all
the police along the front" had perspired
for a half hour in assisting the "drivers,"
who all earned their dimes by the sweat
of their brows.
Captain Dunlevy of the harbor police
and James Orndorf were nearly run down
by William Taylor, a driver for the West
ern Transfer Company, at the foot of
Clay street about 2p. m. yesterday The
captain expostulated with the man and
was replied to in an extremely vulgar
manner, whereupon he arrested Tavlor
and booked him at the harbor police sta
tion on a charge of using vulgar lan
guage. The arrested man was bailed out
by E. T. Brown.
The bar was reported smooth yester
day until 10 a. m., when It suddenly grew
pretty rough and continued so for several
hours.
EXTENSION IS
TO CONTINUE
The Second Session of the
Ancient Order of United
Workmen.
Fixing Salaries and Authorizing Ex
pendituresâPer Capita Tax
Ayain $2 SO
The time of the representatives to the
Grand Lodge of the Ancient Order of
United Workmen was taken up yesterday
in the consideration of reports and reso
lutions.
The report of the grand master work
man was adopted as printed.
The report of the finance committee was
also adopted. This shows that th>j volume
of business during; the year was: General
fund, $iJ4 ,625 31; beneliciary fund, $701,
000 t<s; relief fund, $46,;fTG U9; Lowry fund,
$511 31. The disbursements were: General
fund, $G3,550 0-i; benetlclary fund, $701,000;
relief fund, $32 ,085 OS; Lowry fund, tjllt jll 31.
The following recommendation of ex
penditures for the current year was
adopted;
Grand recorder, $2500; deputy grand recorder,
$'JWj; i-hlet Clerk, $Â«X>; three clerks, $1280; grand
receiver, |C 00; surety bonds, $100; recorder' a of
fice, contingent, $j00; stationery, $15u; rent,
|7SO; supplies. $1500; Grand Lodge, $3000; Grand
.Lodge hail rent, $lUO, printing, $12uO; Supreme
LiHlge, per capita, $2500; finance committee,
$3bu; grand medical examiner, $1500; badge and
photograph, $65; official orsan, $4260; insurance,
$27 50; grand master, $1000; arbitration, contin
gent, $ltnl; corporate directors, contingent, $100;
Interest on loan, $20,000, $Uou; extension work,
$14,401); total, $42,252 50.
The per capita tax, payable in five in
stallments, was fixed at $2 50.
A motion to abolish the $3 premium for
members was defeated.
The grand body refused to amend the
Grand .Lodge constitution so as to strike
out the authority vested in the grand re
corder to omit, except from the grand
master workman, any matter he may
deem not proper for publication; refused
to strike from the constitution the sec
tion authorizing the publishing of assess
ment notices in the official organ; refused
to increase the compensation of the grand
medical examiner from 25 to 50 cents per
certificate; refused to provide for a de
crease in the maximum assessment of
members after 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and
60 years' membership; refused to enlarge
the class of beneficiaries; refused to in
crease the duties and compensation of
deputies; a proposition to abolish the
official organ was tabled.
So much time was taken up in discus
sion that the nomination and election of
grand officers was not reached. This
event, which has occupied the attention
of the politicians of the order for months,
will take place to-day.
Among the recommendations adopted
by the Grand Lodge is one by the grand
medical examiner, which suggests that
the lodge examiners should have a better
understanding of the duties required of
them, and he sets forth several reminders
to such examiners, namely, that they
should closely scan applicants to deter
mine if there is anything that will vitiate
tho full expectancy of life; that they
ghoul-- remember that the relation be
tween the applicant and examiner is dif
ferent from that which exists between

competitive drill and exemplification of
the work by teams from Pacific Lodge
of Oakland, Mount Hamilton Lodge of
San Jose and Prosperity Lodge of this
city
Tho judges were J. Michaels and D.

ton and Percy J. King on floor work.
Each team made a line appearance,
Pacific tram appearing in the initiatory
work in dress suits.
The best work of a Master Workman
was that by the one of Mount Hamilton,
for it was almost perfect. The most dra
matic work was that of Prosperity team,
but there was some fault in the memor
ized work. The floor work in the drills
w : as well executed.
The Judges awarded the first prize to
Mount Hamilton Lodge and divided the
second prlzo between the other two
During the evening Deputy Grand
Master Workman F. S. Poland, who is

THE LAGGING MESSAGE.
H^ VEX when the war spirit of this people is
aroused the public is not deaf to reason. That
JJ â * the rirst message of the President was a dis
appointment was freely stated at the time of its ap
pearance. That the second one will be a disappoint
ment there is no cause to believe. So far as may be
judged by the inevitable leakage of executive Cabinet
sessions, by the utterances of the President himself, it
will be virile, decisive, and, instead of bidding for
peace, lay down the only grounds on which peace may
be secured. That these grounds will involve the
holding up of American honor there can be no ques
tion. The sentiment of the country is so manifest
that an executive orricer could not ignore it, even if
he so desired, and President McKinlcy is believed to
be in full accord with the people. Therefore there
will be no protest at the withholding of the message
now, and information that this is done for "good and
sutricient" reasons will be unmurmuringly accepted.
The conditions upon which this line of conduct is
based constitute a strange reflection upon the charac
ter of the people whom we may soon oppose in arms.
There is fear that a message presaging war woul-.i
precipitate a massacre of Americans in Havana. What
manner of people are these civilized savages? There
is no talk in Xew York about killing the resident
Spanish. In San Francisco nobody breathes a threat
against any native of Spain. They are more secure
than if back in their own troubled realm of Castile.
The record of the Spanish nation must be borne in
mind. A feeling which found expression in jubilation
when the Maine was blown up, or in sneers at the
bodies of her dead, must belong to a people unworthy
of trust. The same riff-raff who gloried in one whole
sale murder would not hesitate to cut the throats cf
defenseless aliens.
The message can wait.
AN IMPERTINENT JUNTfI.
THE statement is made that the Cuban Junta will
decline to accept any solution of the Spanish
question which shall not involve the immediate
independence of the island they love so well and so
faithfully stay away from. If this is true the imper
tinence of the Junta is something as entirely without
precedent as the blowing up of the Maine. The
threat to fight against American troops sent to Cuba
unless they be sent to carry out the orders of the
Junta is as bad as treason.
The peculiar intelligence entering into the com
position of the Junta has an entire misconception of
the position of this Government. This country is
rot inspired with the spirit of war because of Cuba's
wrongs. It has not been stirred to a frenzy be
cause of a lot of agitators it has tolerated. This
country, on the other hand, is acting for itself and
not for any swart clique ungrateful for an asylum it
has afforded. In the harbor of Havana is the rusting
wreck of an American battle-ship. Had the Junta
heard of this? Had it heard that the ship was sent by
treachery most foul to the bottom of a "friendly" port
whither it had gone on a mission of peace? Has
the information percolated through its gray matter
that 266 American seamen were murdered when that
ship went down?
People of the United States decline to accept the
notion that the stars and stripes are no protection to
the men serving in the shadow of the flag. They re
member a long list of indignities and indecencies
heaped upon them by Spain and not properly re
sented. They recall that the history of that nation is
a history of shame, that its presence in the West is
a blight and a menace. Who breaks bread with you
and cuts your throat is no desirable neighbor. There
fore Spain must pack up and go.
It is true that there is sympathy for the Cubans,
particularly for those who have fought and suffered.
But the impending fight with Spain will be on strictly
American account. The lines to govern it will not be
laid down by the Junta. If that body persist in its
absurd and insufferable insolence it should be sup
pressed as dangerous to the public welfare.
Spanish Minister Bernabe's talk of a hope of peace
has a pleasing sound, but it is based upon the mis
understanding of facts. For instance, he says his
country is enlightened, self-respecting, and his people
governed by high aspirations and noble instincts.
Where are his proofs?
It is a strange circumstance that when two convicts
at San Quentin desire to fight there seems to be no
obstacle placed in their way. No system of prison
reform of which there is common knowledge includes
rough and tumble fighting among approved forms of
amusement.
No wonder fhe afternoon papers objected to the

NOW FOR THE PENALTY.
THAT rascality has marked the progress of the
fern- depot since the structure rose above the
foundation level has been amply demonstrated.
That the money of the people voted for the erection
of the building has been wasted, that it has gone to
favored contractors for inferior work or has stuck to
the fingers of somebody who had the handling of it,
has been shown with such clearness there can be no
denial. The facts have been laid bare, the figures il
lustrating the shamelessness with which the State has
been robbed published in detail. In the court of pub
lic opinion the conviction of the robbers has already
been accomplished. They were openly accused, and
they had no defense to offer.
Anything like a complete review of the facts hereto
fore set forth would require much space, the original
exploitation having consumed columns. It may,
however, be said in a general way that every con
tractor whose work was of sufficient importance to be
investigated seems to have attempted deliberately to
defraud, and, with the connivance of the Harbor
Commissioners and the supervising architect, to have
succeeded. The very walls represent a cheat, while
inside the depot is honeycombed with visible traces of
jobbery' and crookedness.
C. F. McCarthy had the masonry contract. How he
was permitted to put in Colusa stone and was paid at
the rate asked for Oregon stone has been repeatedly
stated. It was to him a clear and unmerited gain of
$11,000. How he was allowed to substitute brick
worth $6 per thousand for the specified article worth
$75 has been told. It is known also that he discarded
white glazed tile for marble, eliminated the arched
tiling, substituting expanded metal, left out terra
cotta, at a saving of thousands to himself, and instead
of making a reduction such as the State could justly
have demanded, was actually paid extra for having
done cheap work after having signed a contract to do
good work. The loss of the commonwealth on ac
count of this one contractor has been $45,241.
Throughout the list there runs a similar record of
broken trust, of trickery and double dealing. The
Batemans, for instance, were paid extra for their con
sideration in using Oregon pine for the interior finish
after they had agreed to use oak, pine selling in open
market then at $20 per thousand and oak at $120 per
thousand. True, they claim to have used more of the
pine than they had intended to use of the oak, but
there is reason to question even this statement. The
Batemans were paid extortionate prices for certain
extras, getting in instances four times the price
at which any outside contractor would have been glad
of a chance to do the work. The plumbing, the gal
vanized iron, the steam heating, have all been char
acterized by a similar disregard for honesty and of
the terms of the several contracts. This grows to be
an old story; it becomes as a tale that is told.
The purpose in making this series of exposures was
not merely to entertain readers, to harass unfaith
ful officials or bring the community into disrepute for
its toleration of such palpable crime. It was to open
to the proper investigating body the way to check
the rascals, to pave for the offenders, if not a way to
the penitentiary, at least one to private life. The pre
liminary work is done. The facts are common prop
erty. Upon the Grand Jury must rest the burden of
treating the officials as they deserve to be treated. A
paper may hold up to condemnation, perhaps to
scorn. It can do nothing more. The machinery of
the law is not at its command.
CALIFORNIA READY.
AMONG the first and foremost commonwealths
in the Union to make ready for the possibility
of war is California. A few States have pre
ceded us in voting money for war purposes, but this
is due to the fact that their Legislatures are in ses
sion, while ours is not. Moreover, such precedence
is one of foi;m rather than of fact, for our laws pro
vide for war emergencies by authorizing the Gov
ernor, with the consent of one member of the State
Board of Examiners, to at any time raise money
needed for pubiic defense, and thus in the matter of
appropriating funds for the threatened war we have
been ready and prepared all along.
More impressive, however, than the mere voting of
appropriations contingent on the outbreak of war has
been the action of Governor Budd in notifying the
Government at Washington that California will fur
nish the necessary number pf competent officers and
men from her naval militia to man the Monadnock
or Monterey complete should occasion arise. That
this offer was regarded as of the highest value in the
emergency is made evident by the fact that the Navy
Department, through Assistant Secretary Roosevelt,
at once telegraphed to the Governor asking him to
proceed immediately to put the naval militia of the
State in a condition to meet any sudden call for their
services by the President.
If war comes with Spain it will be in the main a
war upon the sea. There will be of course a descent
upon Cuba, but as the great mass of the inhabitants
of the island will welcome our troops as liberators,
the struggle for supremacy there will not be of long
duration. It will be by navies that the contest will
be fought out, and the seaman rather than the soldier
will have to face its dangers and accomplish the vic
tory. It is for that reason that the offer of
California to furnish competent officers and men to
man the Monadnock or the Monterey was so accept
able at Washington. There were not in the navy
enough men to man the ships we had before we pur
chased the new vessels from abroad with the emer
gency defense fund, and accordingly every addition
to our naval force is doubly welcome to the Gov
ernment.
With all our loyalty to the Union, which since the
Civil War has become almost a religion in the coun
try, there still remains among our people an intense
State pride and patriotism. We are glad at all times
to see the flag of the republic borne with honor
through dangerous duties, but the gladness has an
added intenseness when it is borne by the hands of
men who represent our State. It is therefore with
more than ordinary gratification that we see Califor
nia taking a foremost place in offering to the Govern
ment men who will serve the nation in the post of
greatest danger if war comes, as now seems inevit
able. Governor Budd has done his duty well, and the
naval militia that has so promptly responded for duty
has added another to many reasons why Califomians
are almost as proud of their State as of the republic
itself.
If the people of this country had their way they
would send a polite note to the powers setting forth
the advantage which may accrue to a nation by the
simple process of attending to its own business. This
little affair with Spain can be attended to strictly by
home talent.
A father who shot five times at a man who had
grossly insulted his daughter was promptly released
by the Police Judge, which was well. However,
there is a feeling that any father under such circum
stances ought to do a little better shooting.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 7, 1898.
THE SUPPRESSION OF POOLROOMS.
â^ FFORTS made by the Merchants' Association
to bring about the suppression of poolrooms in
* â * the city are in themselves commendable, and it
is gratifying to law abiding people to have the asso
ciation actively assisting in a work of the kind. The
fact that such efforts on the part of such an organ
ization are necessary is, however, a matter to be de
plored. Why should an association of private citizens
be called on to perform a work which the law imposes
upon the police?
Any enforcement of law by private citizens is a
species of lynch law; it is an evidence that the police
have not performed their duty. Had the Chief of
Police and the force under his command exerted any
thing like a proper vigilance and energy it would not
have been necessary for the merchants of the city to
combine to put an end to the illicit traffic of pool
selling. The situation, therefore, is by no means
creditable to the community, for the very approval
given to the Merchants' Association carries with it
a condemnation of the officers of the law.
There is no excuse for the inaction of the police in
the matter. A short time ago The Call thoroughly
exposed the extent to which illicit pool-selling is car
ried on. It gave elaborate descriptions of rooms in
which pools are sold exclusively to women and speci
fied the locations of each of them. All the informa
tion which the police could have required to find
the rooms and suppress them was made public In
formation was also given of the sale of pools to
minors. With all these facts before them the police
did nothing, or next to nothing, and pool-selling
went along as openly as if it were legal and honest
business instead of an illegal and nefarious trade.
Downtown poolrooms are unlawful and it is the
duty of the police to suppress them. That suppres
sion can be brought about if the Chief of Police sees
fit to order it. If the officers will raid the poolrooms
and arrest all who are found there and carry away all
the paraphernalia of the dens, it will not be long be
fore illicit pool-selling in San Francis o will cease
to be a public scandal and an open temptation to
young men and foolish women. The continuance of
the evil is due to the negligence of the police, and the
necessity for interference on the part of the Mer
chants' Association is a proof of the necessity for a
change in police methods and police management.
REPAYING MARKET STREET.
A MORNING contemporary, commenting upon
the project of repaying Market street prior to
the construction of a main sewer and a final
settlement with the digging corporations, says that
damage to the surface from building a sewer and lay
ing gas and water pipes need not be considered.
"Under good management," this eminent reasoner
declares, "it is as easy to relay a section of pavement
properly as to lay it well in the first place." It is
impossible to controvert this self-evident truth. But
what about the fact that during forty years of muni
cipal life not a section of pavement in San Francisco
has been "properly" laid in the second place?
It is not incredible that our esteemed Market street
improver may be induced to perceive the error of its
arguments by applying them to its own business. An
engine in its basement is necessary to run its presses.
But suppose the architect who designed its tall struc
ture, upon submitting the plans, had said, "Oh, yes, I
an engine must go in, but I have not yet decided
upon the best make. We will put that in afterward.
True, we may have to tear down the building to do it. !
but it is easy to reconstruct, you know. Men and
money will do anything." Will our contemporary
please inform an expectant public what would have '
happened to that architect soon after making this
speech?
Nor does the additional statement that where pav
ing is not done aright the fault lies with the Super
intendent of Streets help out the argument. It is not
impossible that when it becomes necessary to over
haul the city's sewers we may have a Superintendent
with a "sense of responsibility," but the contingency
is so remote as to be scarcely worth considering. We
have had no Superintendent with a "sense of respon
sibility" since the consolidation of the cityâ that is,
if we are to judge from the fact that 150 miles of
streets have been accepted in which no permanent
sewers have been laid or gas and water pipes ar
ranged. Consequently it is safe to assume that we
never will have one.
The truth of the matter is â and we say it without
desjring to interfere with the plans of our contempor
ary or those of the contractors who hope to make a
few dollars out of the workâ that repaying Market
street prior to the. construction of a main sewer and
conduits for water and gas pipes and telegraph wires
is a scheme so wild as to actually surpass even the
genius of a Board of Supervisors. Boards of Super
visors are famous for beginning at the wrong ends of
things. Were it physically possible we could imagine
them building the roofs of houses before the founda
tions. But in repaying Market street according to the
plans proposed the present board has gained a niche
in the temple of fame to which no "solid nine" or
"shifty eight" will ever be likely to aspire. Th> work
will cost $150,000. Half this money will be thrown
away if the street is repaved without first building
a sewer and spiking the guns of the burrowing cor
porations.
But, as the hod carrier said when he lost a dollar
in the lottery, "Aisy comes, aisy goes." Taxes come
easy: make them fly.
JAIL TriE PLfICE FOR THEM.
THERE is seldom reason for surprise when men
are allowed to qualify on bonds which they
have no property to make good. This form of
crime is common, and it is most inexcusable, be
cause it is impossible unless through the connivance
or the carelessness of a Judge. But it is surprising
when an offender is detected that he should be per
mitted to escape punishment. He is guilty of per
jury, committed under such circumstances as may
work great wrong to the community. Jail is the
place for him.
Two men went on the bond of one Cervantes, so
as to permit him to administer the estate of his wife,
it having come into his possession by the sudden
and suspicious death of the woman after she had
been married a week. They swore they had prop
erty worth $2000 each, and were accepted by Judge
Coffey. Yet tiie first's property is assessed Â°at
$1100. it being incumbered by a mortgage for $1600
Besides, the man. as he confessed to the Judge, is
not a citizen. The second only has property assessed
at $750. The Judge refused to retain them on the
bond. He did not cause their arrest for perjury
The public would like to know why.
The fact that an~uTs^ance company is anxious to
lend the Government $10,000,000 shows that it recog
nizes a good investment when it sees it.
By a little more ingenuity the lawyers for Haynes
may establish the fact that brave Lieutenant Burke
killed himself.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
At the Opera Comlque, the other day,
the first performance was given of "L'lle
dv Reve" (The Dream Island), described
as a "Polynesian Idyl." The opera is
based on Pierre Lotl's successful novel,
"Le Mariage de Loti." and Reynaldo
Hahn contributed the music. Loti, who
is the youngest member of the French
Academy, is a naval officer with a singu
lar capacity for falling In love and get
ting married to the ladies he meets in
different ports. It Is saiu that . he has
contracted no less than six different mat
rimonial alliances, not to speak of a
legitimate marriage in France. As the
French law takes no rojrniznnoÂ«Â» of wed
dings with little Japanese and Polynesian
maidens, Loti has sailed away scot free
when the hymeneal chains have begun to
chafe. The six marriages have never
been officially authenticated, but it is a
fact that Loti has written so picturesque
ly about some of his spurious weddingsâ
the alliance with sweet "Mme. Chrysan
themum," for instanceâ all the world
PIERRE LOTI, on Whose Successful Novel, "Le Mariage de Loti," Hahn's Opera, "L'lle
dv Reve" (The Dre^n Island), Is Based.
The picture represents the famous novelist V character costume aa an Arab Sheik.
has read, and a large part If it has sym-
pathized with the omnivorous lover. The
opera "L'lle dv Reve" tells of one of
these weddings. Most of the male char
acters in the work wear French naval
uniforms. Monsieur Clement sang the
role of the glittering but delusive Loti.
It is certainly a new departure for a man
to go to an opera house and see a singer,
wearing his uniform and bearing his
name, go through a love-making and
marriage which he himself has actually
experienced.
The aeed Verdi is still to the front,
this time, however, not in connection with
opera. He has gone to Paris to person
ally superintend the production of some
new sacred music suitable for Holy
Thursday and Good Friday. The peren
nial old man of music will conduct his
compositions to-day and to-morrow at
the concerts of the Societe dv Conserva
toire. Strange to say there are no solo
parts for men's voices in the latest work
of the master, most of the score consist
ing of solo and quartet work for female
voices. The vocalists chosen to interpret
the music are Miles. Ackte and Louise
Grandjean, sopranos, and Mile. Delna and
Mme. Heglon, contraltos. Mile. Ackte is
a young girl who only graduated a few
months ago from the Paris Conservatoire,
where she won the grand prize for sing
ing. She stepped straight from her music
school, to the boards of the Opera Com
ique, where she made her appearance as
Marguerite, in "Faust," with such suc
cess that she became a popular Parisian
Idol at once. She is said to recall Chris
tine Nllspon, both in her beauty and her
voice, and the fact that Verdi has select
ed her to render his new music speaks
volumes for her future success.
By royal decree, Ovlde Musin has been
made a professor of the violin at the
Liege Conservatory, in place o.
Thompson. This will be like coming homo
for the wandering Musin, for he was a
student and a "wonner child" at the same
conservatory, and in 1868 at the a^e of 14
he took two gold medals. After complet
ing his studies with Leonard he went to
Paris with his professor, and about
twenty years ago played with flattering
success in England, Holland and Switzer
land. The passion for travel then seized
â¢ .â ... ami liv. - . uiiULl'iuxk a SerisJuiOl iÂ«...
forgotten for years together In the
world's musical centers.. Musln has twice
made the tour of the world, and in the
course of his journeys has wandered over
both the Americas. He has also exten
sively explored Japan, Java and Siberiaand
has visited Australia, New Zealand and
many parts of Africa. Either owing to
his wandering life or to other causes,
Musin ! lost some of his skill as a virtu
oso, and could never be relied upon to
play with his former brilliancy. '; It is to
be. hoped that now he has settled down
in the home of his childhood he will de
vote himself more seriously to music
again. Musin has not completely for
sworn traveling, however, for he has only
undertaken to teach in Liege for six
months in the year. On his last appear
ance In San Francisco he played during
most of his concerts to empty houses.
The English play censor Is evidently of
one mind with the local tenors who suf
fers from qualms of conscience when the
San Francisco Oratorio Society rehearses
Snlnt-Sacns' "Samson et Dalila." Grau
had this fine opera among the list of
works to be produced during the coming
season at Covent Garden Opera-house,
London. The censor has positively pro
hibited its representation. This is not
on account of any intrinsic levity, for as
an oratorio it would pass muster in the
British Isles without question, but operas
based on Scriptural subjects are never
allowed in operatic form In England.
When Rossini's "Moses" was creating a
furor in a number of European cities its
production was prohibited in England till
the music had been adapted to a new
libretto entitled "Peter the Hermit."
When the actions of Moses were attribut
ed to the preacher of the First Crusade
the work was produced without question.
Later, when the public wanted "Moses"
in its integrity, it was produced in ora
torio form. Great disgust is expressed in
France at the fact that "Samson" will
not be heard in London this season.
An opera by Emilio Ferrari is soon to
be produced in Milan, written to the
verses of the "Cantico di Cantici." a
drama by the late Cavalloti. Special in
terest will attach to this work on ac
count of the tragic death of Cavalloti a
few weeks ago. He was one of the most
distinguished politicians in Italy, and was
a brilliant orator and journalist. Caval
loti considered himself Insulted by some
remarks in a newspaper article written
by a political rival, and a duel was the
consequence. The politician's friends
thought iittle of t ...5. as ho had already
fought thirty-two ,iels without serious
consequences. It was also his adversary's
sixteenth duel. On the field Cavalloti,
who was very near-sighted, received a
sword thrust In 1 .c lip. He signaled that
the wound was only slight, when sud
denly he put his hand to his mouth and
fell forward, dead. The sword thrust had
cleft his eloquent tongue In two and had
mortally wounded his throat. Cavallotl
was a popular idol, and the opera "Can
tlco di Cantici" ("Sor.g of Songs"), found
ed on his drama, will be regarded as a
sort of swan song.
Next June an effort will be made to
transport Bayreuth to the banks of the
Thames. There are a great many Lon
doners who want to see Wagner opera
in all its glory, but who cannot spend the
time reqiÂ«slte to travel to the temple of
art presided over by Frau Cosima Wag
ner. For their delectation an effort is
being made to give a series of Wagner
operas in exact imitation of the enter
tainment provided at Bayreuth. Herr
Schulz-Curtius has charge of the enter
prise and poor Seidl was to have been
the conductor. Efforts are now being
made to secure Mottl or Nisksch. Among
the artists are to be Nordica, Brema,
Ternina and Ella Russel, Jean and
Edouard de Reszke, Van Dyck Lieban,
Van Rooy and Wittekopf. The entire
cycle of the "Nibelung" will be given and
the cost of an orchestra chair for the en
tire series will be $26 50. If the enterprise
prcves successful, and other cities follow
the example of London, Frau Cosima
Wagner may perchance find her temple
deserted.
Statistics have been gathered concern
ing the new symphonic works produced
in London last year. It seems that there
were sixty-five symphonies which were
due to forty different composers. It goes
without saying that on their native heath,
so to speak, the British composers out
number the others. Eighteen Britishers
are responsible for twenty-one of the
compositions. Then follow nine Russians
with seventeen compositions. Ten Ger
mans produced thirteen, nine Frenchmen
are responsible for twelve of the sym
phonic works, and finally a Bohemian
and a Scandinavian each contributed one
symphony to make up the total sixty
live. Not a single American or Italian
figures on the list.
The Saint-Cecilia Society of Copen
hagen is reviving old Italian church
music with a success which ought to lead
choral societies in other countries to fol
low its example. "Jephtha," an oratorio
by Carissimi, has been found as interest
ing as any modern work and several of
Palcstrina's works have delighted the
audiences.

A TRAVELING LIBRARY.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: On Mon
day last I read your article on "A Travel
ing Library." I believe you have broached
a long felt want in all rural districts. By
all means place books in our hands if It
can possibly be done. Tour readers, I
think, would like to have you unfold, in
all its details, the plan by which books
in the State Library can be made use of
by those who are distant from the cap
ital, and especially as to the defraying
of the increased expense incurred.
The people know they are taxed to pay
for the books; they know therefore that
they are entitled to read them: they
know it would be a great boon to them if
they could have them to read, and there
fore it is to be hoped that The Call will
continue, what It has so well begun, an
agitation for a measure of justice to a
large number of citizens whose Isolation
has caused them to suffer from neglect
and non-appreciation.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April C.
An Interesting suit which has been In
litigation for fourteen years and which
has at different times proved of great in- I
terest to Alameda and Contra Costacoun- j
tics was decided by the Supreme Court I
yesterday. It is the famous suit of Kelly |
vs. Owens, which involves the 3e~rets of '
the discovery of making the celebrated ;
Damascus steel, the manufacture of
which is generally considered to be a lost
art.
Sixteen years ago Dr. Lee, one of the :
best known physicians of this city, a rel- '
Etive of the Lees of Virginia, a man of
great scientific attainments and of an ex- '
perimontal nature, started a series of
Iments having for their object the
discovery of the process of making that
quality of steel known as Damascus steel.
At great expense and with much labor
he succeeded in producing a small quan
. steel at his experimental works at
Melrose. The metal ho produced was
by scientists and experts and was
ted to be the best quality of steel
then known. He made a tew bars of it
ui-a gave them to dentists and instrument
makers, and they an agreed that it made
â¢ tit Instruments mat could possibly
;. ana that no such steei had
ever been brought to their notice.
Among those who used instruments
made from the metal was Dr. Christen
: San Francisco, another doctor in. j
Martinez and others, who still adhere to
the declaration that Dr. Lee had indeed
valuable discovery.
Having expended nearly all of his money
on his experiments, Dr. Lee was unable
to proceed further without financial as- j
fusiance. j.ue success of his work was so 'â¢
well attested that a Mr. Owens of San
Leandro put up the necessary funds and
1 Lee at once built at Martinez a
plant for the manufacture of the steel.
. .ought the land on which their plant
rei led and incorporated, after which
ound no diflicuity In disposing of
their stock for cash on the market.
A little later Mrs. Kelly, the plaintiff in
it just decided, took an interest in
the plant, and became so imbued with
the spirit of speculation that she did not
give i'r. Lee any peace until she had se
cured a very large block of the stock. In
order to do this she exchanged with the
corporation a parcel of land consisting of
res, located in Glenn County, and
worth $15, w.i. for her stock. Mrs. Kelly
was very eager to obtain the stock, which
Owens could then have sold at its cash
value in the open market.
After the exchange, Mrs. Kelly took a
personal interest in the manufacture of
the steel, and was continually at theplant
In Martinez. Dr Lee stated to his friends
that Mrs. Kelly was altogether too im- '
and that her presence at the
works worried and annoyed him con- j
ibly. Finally, in desperation, Dr. j
Leo stated that he needed a rest. He left !
the works at Martinez and went to San
Francisco. He paid a few bills, made a
few calls, attended to much important
ness, and absolutely dropped out of ;
sight. He was last seen about fourteen
years ago taking the train to Santa Cruz, i
and from that time to this nothing what
ever has been heard of him.
l i is mysterious disappearance with the !
secret of the process for making the steel
upset the work at Martinez, and Mrs.
Kelly, realizing that her stock was not
likely to produce anything, brought suit
to have her contract of exchange set
eside. She commenced her action over
thirteen years ago and the original cÂ«m- j
plaint was written by Judge Catlinof Sac
ramento. Some time later D. M. Delmas
and Messrs. deary and Franklin P. Bull :
represented the plaintiff and the case was
tried a: Martinez before a Napa County
Judge, since dead. Judge Dwindle
cf the old District Court of San Fran-
Cisco, and David McClure, both of whom
are nov dead, were the attorneys for
Owi as and the case was bitterly fought \
and created much interest more because !
of the legal talent engaged than the mer
its of the suit.
During the litigation Owens died and
bis widow became the defendant. The
: trial resulted in a verdict for the
rilaintin. but this was reversed by the
Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial,
llefore the argument was made in the
Bupreme Court, the attorneys, Dwinelle
S.nd McClure were dead and the case was
argued by Garrett McEnerney.
Judge Gibson of this city and Welles '
Whitmore then entered the case, which
Va.s retried at Martinez before judge
Jones. It was again decided against the
defendant, Owens, and was once more !
taken to the Supreme Court. That tri- j
tunal in an opinion written by Judge Me- i
Karland reversed the judgment and
granted defendant a new trial. A motion
was made for a rehearing by Attorney |
l'elmas, which was granted, and the case i
was again argued before the Supreme j
Â«'ourt in bank. Yesterday they affirmed'
the department decision, giving defendant I
it new trial, and this virtually decides
the case in favor of the defendant, be
cause the decision touches on a point
v.!:ieh prevents a new trial. It states
that inasmuch as the suit was an action
for a rescinding of a contract, there
Ihould have been an offÂ»*r to rescind made
c any action was commenced. As
..us not done, the attorneys for the
defendant claim they have won their case

At intervals regular searches have been
made to discover the presence or fate of
Dr. Lee, but so far nothing has .been

â  seen on the Santa Cruz train over
thirteen years ago.

HE CLAIMS A
BIG FORTUNE
William F. Barker Needs but
Two Certificates of
Proof.
Inherits Through â  Brother Who
Has Just Died in
Missouri.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
908 Broadway, April 6.
A certificate of his mother's marriage
and one of his own birth are all that
stand between "William F. Barker of this j
city and an English estate of large pro- j
portions. This is the story told by that
gentleman to-day, and he gave the par- j
ticulars in the most minute detail.
This good fortune comes to him through
the death of his cousin, George T. Barker,
at Jefferson City, Mo., three weeks ago.
Tha deceased was the heir to the for- j
tune, and his cousin in this city asserts j
that he had made all proofs to the satis- j ,
faction of the Court of Chancery in Eng- j
land, and the case had been settled in
his favor. The London barrister. Sir Wil
liam Humphreys, attended to the legal |
work for the Missourian, and assured him j
before his death that he could step into
possession of his estate whenever he saw
fit to come to that country. But he never
visited the domain which is now claimed
under the English law of succession by I
W. F. Barker. I,
Mr. Barker starts away back in 1613
to trace his relationship to the estate.
In that year a son of Sir John Barker, of
Ireland, committed suicide, leaving the
Barker estate. By a series of marriages
which are fully set forth by Sir William
Humphrey, the Davidson estate of Scot
land and the Essex estate of England
have been consolidated and are now one.
The Countess of Melrose married into
the family, and should Barker and hia i
oldest son die, the Melrose Tobacco Com- I
pany would be the next heir, through that \
marriage. But this is not likely to hap
pen as Mr. Barker is pushing everything
to secure control of the estate. He says
he will have an attorney of San Fran
cisco attend to the legal points, but he
Is already in correspondence with Sir
William Humphrey. The papers upon
which it is claimed that George Barker !
made his proofs are in Los Angeles now, I
and will be turned over to his attorney
on their arrival here.
"The British Court of Chancery meets
in July," said Mr. Barker, this afternoon, ;
"and then we will know whether we can !
secure the estate without litigation. I j
was in England in 18S7 and saw the do- |
main, and was told by Sir Humphrey that
it was a very large one as well as valu- !
able. The matter had then just been
taken out of the courts. We- hope to I
avoid going into chancery, which would j
ruin our chances of ever getting it in
my lifetime.
"Until July I shall contain myself in
patience, but when the whole matter is
settled I expect to go at once to take
charge of the estate. I want it under
stood that I have received nothing from
the estate, nor will unless I get the
whole."
Mr. Barker is a hard-working mechanic,
living in North Oakland, with his wife
and family. Should his hopes be realized,
the windfall will come at a most oppor
tune time, as he is nearing the age where
making a living for his family Is some
what of a hardship.

M. Foster, has filed a demurrer to the

that the complaint does not state suf

of the action or person of defendant, and
tnat the complaint is ambiguous, uncer
tain and uninte.iifc.o.e, in that it is not

WILL LET HIS
WIFE BE FREE
Young Mrs. Ainsworth
Had to Flee at Night to
Her Mother.
Very Anxious for a Piano That
She Says the Captain Gave
to Her.
The Aged Husband's Story Puts tha
Girl Wife in a Very Peculiar
Position.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. April 6.
It was decided to-day that the divorce
suit of the Ainsworths should not be con
tested. The young lady will be permitted
to obtain her divorce and the aged hus
band, old enough to be her grandfather,
with a decade of years to spare, will not
make any effort to prevent her from car
rying out plans which her correspond
ence shows she has already laid for the
future.
Captain George R. R. Alnsworth was
many years ago a wealthy New York
banker. Some of his speculations went
wrong and .he gradually lost most of his
possessions. With what little remained
to him he came to the coast and has lived
on Market street in this city many
years. He has long been a widower and
has two sons now In business in Oakland.
About eighteen months ago Captain
Ainsworth surprised his friends and rela
tives by taking to his house a young
girl then little over 17 years of age named
Ida Murphy and proclaiming that she
was his wife. An investigation was nec
essary to satisfy his family that their
father had committed any such peculiar
act, but proof was forthcoming and they
accepted the situation.
According to the young lady's com
plaint for divorce they lived in moderate
Gomestic happiness for about six months,
after which they began to quarrel. Grad
ually, according to the allegations, the
aged husband Decame more and more
cruel, ana on two occasions the girl wife
says she was forced to flee to her mother,
who lived close by the Ainsworths, for
protection. In each instance she returned
to her husband. She also says she was
induced to marry him because he repre
sented to her that he was well situated
financially, and that he was in a posi
tion to educate her and bring her up in
such a manner as bents the wife of a
wealthy man.
These promises have not been fulfilled,
but it is stated that on one occasion Cap
tain Ainsworth gave his young wife a
very good piano, and she is very anxious
that the court award her this gift. The
piano and the decree of divorce will ap
parently satisfy the young lady.
There is, however, another side to this
equinoctial romance. The captain has in
his possession some very interesting let
ters, certainly such letters as a dutiful
young wife is not supposed to write. They
are to young men, and in one of them
there is more than a suggestion that a
trip to Portland, Or., would be a pleas
ant diversion from young Mrs. Ains
worth's routine life. These letters were
corralled by the captain owing to the
thoughtlessness of young Mrs. Ainsworth
when she left for the last time her hus
band's roof-tree. The captain says that
he does not consider It advisable to try
and hold such a giddy young girl to her
marriage vows w-hen she shows such a
strong desire to have them severed, and
consequently in his answer he merely de
nies in a perfunctory way each and all of
the allegations and will not be sorry
when he is again free to commit matri
mony. â¢
The captain Is a dignified, well-edu
cated, reticent man, and it has always
been a surprise to his many friends how
he was led into this hasty marriage with
Miss Murplry.
A HOUSE BOBBED.
Oakland's Fake Gas Inspector Trans
fers the Scene of His Opera
tions to Alameda.
ALAMEDA, April 6.â For some time a
rascal pretending to be a gas Inspector
has been operating in Oakland. His meth
od was to gain admission to a residence
by pretending that he had been sent to
inspect the gas burners In the house,
and once inside he was usually not
watched and had time to ransack the
rooms wherein he carried on his pretend
ed inspection.
Complaints to the police became so nu
merous that the fellow apparently de
cided to transfer the scene of his opera
tions to Alameda, which he did this morn
ing, and succeeded in robbing a house of
a purse containing $3G 75, and also a gold
watch. The residence in Question was
that of W. B. Wellman at ICI7 Central
avenue. The bogus inspector called there
early this forenoon and was admitted
to the basement by a Chinaman. With
out saying anything to the Celestial he
walked directly upstairs and remained
for some time, finally leaving by the front
door. Mrs. Wellman was in the house,
but did not see or hear the intruder.
About noon she had occasion to go to
her room, when she found that her gold
watch and a purse with $36 75 in it were
gone. The police were at once notified.
The Chinaman could not give a very ac
curate description of the thief, but from
what he said it is apparent that he is
the same fake "inspector" who has been
working Oakland. The same fellow also
called at several other places to-day but
so far as heard from stole nothing more
HARBOURNE'S ACCOUNTS.
Expert Davis Will Not Make His Re
port to the Board Until
Saturday.
ALAMEDA. April 6.-It was expected
that Expert Davis, who has been at work
on the library accounts for some time in
order to ascertain the facts with regard
to the Harbourne matter, would have hia
report ready at last night's meetine of
the library trustees. He was not ready,
however, but It was stated that he would
probably hand in his report to Librarian
Weller on Saturday next, and accordingly
a special meeting of the library board
was called for Tuesday evening next, in
or-ier to consider the report.
The delay is said to have been due to
the fact that so far the expert and Treas
urer Wheeler have not been able to get
together and compare the warrants with
the treasurer's accounts. The warrants
that are said to have been manipulated
were somehow sidetracked while the
Grand Jury had the affair under consid
eration and never reached the expert
until yesterday.

ALAMEDA, April 6.â At a meeting of
the Board of Education last evening a
committee of ladies was In attendance
and urged upon the board the project of
establishing classes in the schools for the
purpose of teaching the girl pupils how
to sew. t was pointed out that this was
a very necessary accomplishment, and
that many pupils did not receive instruc
tion at home, while having no time to
attend a regular sewing school. The
committee offered to stand all the ex
pense necessary for establishing the
class, and upon this showing the board
voted to allow the instruction to be given
It is proposed to have two lessons each
week, of half an hour duration in the
higher grades and twenty minutes in the

Donald was playing near a coal oil stove
when its clothes caught fire. Mrs. Mc-
Donald screamed for help and several
neighbors rushed in. They quickly ex
tinguished the fire on the child's clothes,
and it was not badly burned. The tank
of the oil stove in some way also caught
fire, and one of the men who came to the
rescue threw it out of the window. In
the meantime an alarm was given and the
department turned out, but there was
nothing for it to do. No damage was
done and the child was not seriously in
jured.

WRANGLE AMONG REFORMERS.
Professor Plehn and Local Single
Taxers Wage Wordy War.
BERKELEY, April 6.â Professor C. C.
Plehn of the State University and local
single taxers are engaged in a spirited
controversy. The dispute grew out of a
statement recently made by Professor
Plehn, in a lecture at the university, to
the effect that it was the purpose of the
single tax to destroy, to a certain extent,
at least, the receipts of the landowner.
Ralph Hoyt, a prominent single taxer,
took exception to the statement in tha
following sarcastic rejoinder:
â¢ "It seems strange that a high-salaried
professor of political economy in a great
State institution of learning cannot dis
tinguish between destroying ground rent
and taking it for public purposes; or, see-
Ing the difference, that he will not admit
it. If he cannot or will not do that much
toward making the institution useful, the
question naturally arises: What Is he
there for?"
Professor Plehn retorts that it Is useless
to argue with the single tax men, as
"they invariably follow the advice given
to young lawyers: 'When you have no
case abuse your opponents,' " and. In
conclusion, characterizes the proposal of
the single taxers as follows:
"The single tax is not a practical pro
posal for tax reform, unless we first ad
mit the desirability of the social and eco
nomic revolution which these people de
sire to accomplish. I have therefore al
ways confined my study of taxation to
the sufficiently difficult question of what
is the best mode of taxation under the
present economic organization, with prop
erty as it now is. How taxation should
be under another system !s a question as
remote as would be the question of tax
ation in the planet Mars."
MERCHANTS ASK A
GENERAL HOLIDAY
"Tunnel Day " at the RaceTrack
to Be Made an Event of
Importance.
The Exchange Has Outlined a Plan
That Should Insure Big Re
ceipts.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 6.
If the tunnel road which is planned to
connect Alameda and Contra Costa coun
ties be not soon built it will not be the
fault of the Merchants' Exchange or of
President Williams of the race track.
The "Tunnel Road Day" at the race
track has not yet been set, but will be
agreed upon this week.
The committee u f the Merchants' Ex
change has made the following report:
There Is no time to be lost. Preparations
should be made at once. As soon as the day is
announced by Mr. Williams, tickets should be
ready for sale. Then the Mayor should be
asked to declare it a legal holiday. Proprietors
of stores, factories, mills and shops should be
asked to close their places of business. The
ladies of the Ebell Society and all other ladies'
organizations should be asked to participate.
The Labor Exchange and all other organiza
tions, the Acme, Reliance, Turners, Young
Men's Institute, Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation ami Good Roads Association, and all
other societies which have not been heretofore
mentioned should consider themselves invited
from Berkeley, Alameda, San Leandro and the
rest of the county, as well as Oakland.
San Francisco can also afford to donate
handsomely, for it will open a pleasure drive
for her people and the many tourists stopping
at her hotels. A four-in-hand drive with an
easy grade that will bring: thi>m to the top of
Mount Diablo is pronounced by those
â who have been witnesses that a sunset or a
sunrise at that particular Â§pot is worth half
of a person's life. This certainly ought to be
a ereat inducement for San Francisco to
assist.
If this plan, as pictured, is carried out, there
can be little doubt that the amount re
quired for building- the tunnel can be raised in
a day, and no one will be any poorer, and the
$1 Invested will bring interest at the rate of 100
per cent. Last, but not least, the press must
be asked to assist, for it lies In their powr to
make success perfect. Your committee knows
that the press has been in the lead for years,
pointing out the benefits which would be de
rived in both counties by closer communication
and better roads. All of our local and also the
San Francisco papers have furnished editorials
time and again and your committee asks the
gentlemen kindly to Keep it up.

GARDNER HAS
TOLD TWO
ROMANCES
The Ex-Police Clerk
Is in a Very Tight
Box.
Inspector Maloon Relates
His Experience of a
Year Ago.
To Several People Gardner
Has Denied His Latest
Testimony.
WAS THOMAS' DEFENDER.
A Development of the City Hall
Scandals That Savor of Con
spiracy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 6.
The Grand Jury now has to deal with
many suggestions of perjury and unless
appearances are very deceptive Harry
Thomas will soon have company in so
far as being indicted is concerned.
The latest story, which was partly
told to the Grand Jury before it ad
journed and which will be completed
to-morrow, is that of License Inspector
Maloon, whose testimony flatly contra
dicts some of the stories credited to
Charles E. Gardner, ex-clerk of the
Chief of Police. he matter concerns
the loans and subscriptions said to have
been engineered in the interest of
Mayor Thomas by Gardner.
In an interview published Sunday
Gardner said:
The next morning I went to the
Major's office and told him of my
conversation with Wilds. He said
that it was true that he was very
hard up, and that if the boys were
willing to put up something for him
he could not stop them. I asked
the Mayor what he thought would
be a fair subscription. He replied
that the men could subscribe ac
cording to their salaries. Then
the Mayor said: "I think you are
just the one to take this subscrip
tion in hand; a man can put his
name down for what he pleases."
The Mayor then wrote the pre
amble to the subscription list, as
near as I can remember, as fol
lows:
"We, the undersigned, in view of
the contest filed by John L. Davie
over the recent election, the cost
of which contest will fall on
Mayor Thomas, coming, as it does,
on top of a long spell of sickness,
with doctors' bills to pay, and
with the full knowledge and con
sent of said Mayor Thomas, do
hereby subscribe the amounts set
opposite to our names."
The Mayor handed me the pre
amble and I reduced it to type
writing and presented it to Chief
of Police Lloyd. He put his name
down for $10U and 1 signed for $50.
I then took it to Henry Maloon,
License Collector, who was ap
pointed by Thomas, but he re
fused to subscribe. I spoke to Cap
tain of Police Sam Mitchell about
it, and he said the thing was an
outrage and he would not sub
scribe. Finally Chief Lloyd came
to me and said the thing was in
judicious, and told me to stop cir
culating the petition.
The next day the Mayor came to
me and asked me what I had done.
I told him what oraers the chief
had given me, and he said he
guessed it was right. I then gave
the Mayor $50 in cash as my share
of the subscription Shortly after
Dr. Fall came into my office and
read the subscription list, as it lay
on my desk. At the time I pledged
him to secrecy. Subsequently
Chief Lloyd destroyed the sub
scription list.
In August, 1897, Mayor Thomas
again came to me and asked for a
loan of $200. I told him that I did
not have the money and he asked
me to dig it up among the boys.
He said he held a block of mining
stock he was about to lose and he
could not get the money at the
bank. He wante- me to go to
Chief Lloyd to get the loan. I de
clined. He wanted to know if I
"knew any police officers who had
money. I told him Police Officer
Woods had money. The Mayor
said: "You borrow $200 from
Woods and give him your note
for ninety days at 10 per cent.
Then I will make out a note to
you and Harry and myself will
sign it. You get Lloyd to sign
your note." I began to talk loud
in the hallway, saying Woods
would not give me the money,
when the Mayor replied: tr Hushâ
somebody will hear you; I will get
the money elsewhere."
A few days later the Mayor came
to me and wanted me to give up
$10, but I did not have the money.
In October, 1897. the Mayor rushed
into my office, just after I had col
lected my salary. He said he was
very hard up and wanted $25 for
a day or two. I said: "Mayor, I
atn hard up and can't let you have
it unless you promise to pay me
back." He promised, and I gave
him the money, and then he rushed
out of the office. He has not paid
me back, and I propose to sue
him next week. In the meantime
Harry Thomas borrowed $50 from
Police Officer Phillips, and the lat
ter chased him for the money for
weeks. I believe he got it in the
end.
When this story was first told some
weeks ago Gardner was interviewed by
the Oakland Tribune and on March 25
the following appeared in that paper:
Rumors of other requested loans
have been in circulation on the
streets to-day, one of the principal
ones being that Charts Gardner,
clerk of Chief of Police Lloyd, had
gone around with a subscription list
in the interests of the Mayor.
Gardner was indignant when
spoken to in regard to the matter,
and made an emphatic denial.
"I have paid the Mayor ndthing,';
he said, "and I have loaned him
nothing. He has never spoken to me
of money matters, and I know of no
one to whom he has. I know abso
lutely nothing of any money trans
actions in which the Mayor is inter
ested. I have never bought shares in
a mine from the Mayor or any agent
of his, and I did not know that he
had anything to do with a mine. This
is the first I have heard of any sub
scription list, and I am just as un
familiar with the business affairs of
Harry Thomas as I am with those of
his father."
Before the Grand Jury Gardner, It Is
said, substantiated the story told by
him to the newspapers.
"Gardner has prevaricated hugely,"
said License Inspector Henry Maloan
to-night, "and I am going to ; prove it
He ; came Ito me â¢ one morning â  after I
was ; appointed and said, 'Maloon, I
have a subscription I want you to
sign.' "We ; went into the office and
Gardner showed me a typewritten copy
of a subscription list that he had pre
pared, and it â  was signed by Chief
Lloyd and Gardner for $25. I asked
him : 'Gardner, does the Mayor know
anything about this business? ,'No, he
does not,' was the reply, 'but that is all
right.' 'Did he suggest -this?' I next
asked. 'No, Chief Lloyd and I decided
that as we owed our positions to a him
that it was but fair that we should help
sustain the contested election against
ex-Mayor Davie.' 'Well.' I replied,
'don't you have anything, more to do
with it until r: have seen the captain
(Thomas). I am as , near him as any
one, and I know that if he wanted any
help he would let his Republican
friends know it. You are a Populist
holding office under a Republican ad
ministration. To do this will put you
in a bad light.' 'Oh, well if you don't
think it is right,' he said, 'we will drop
the whole thing.' I went to see the
Mayor, but he was out. That afternoon
I did see him and told him what was
being done. He said: 'Who authorized
any such work?' I never did. When
ever I want any help I am able to ask
for it. I did not even know that such
a thing was contemplated.'
"I then tried . to see Gardner, â¢ but id
not find him until I was going into the
police station the next morning. I said,
'Charley, the Mayor does not want that
subscription list to go any further.'
.." 'Oh, I dropped that at once when
you spoke about it,' he said.SSgSS
"That is the story I told the Grand
Jury yesterday and to-morrow I will
go back and present this statement of
the reporter who quoted Gardner on
the 25th of March. â . He will swear to
the truthfulness of that. - This matter
is not nearly so one-sided as the pa
pers have made it appear."
â â  A few days prior to the publication
referred to by Mr. Maloon, John "Wilds
was asked about the matter by another
reporter and said he had never, heard
of the subscription list and that all the
talk about It was ridiculous. ' ;

TO EXTEND STREETS SOUTH.
Mission League Improvement Club
Determined to Better Its
0 Condition.
A meeting of the delegates from the
Mission and Potrero, Preclta Valley, Cort
land avenue, James Lick and "Wilmerding,
Southern Heights and Holly Park Clubs
took place at Maennerbund Hall. Potrero
avenue and Twenty-fourth street on
Tuesday for the purpose of taking decisive
action on the extending of Potrero ave
nue, Hampshire, York and Florida streets
and also Bryant avenue from their pres
ent terminus at Twenty-sixth street to
Army street; and also to urge *he build
ing of the new County Hospital and the
turning of the present site into a park.
These were the principal questions dis
cussed, while at the same time other
matters intending to better the condi
tion of that section of the city came in
for a portion of the league's considera
tion.
The matter of the creeping gait of the
Mission-street cars as brought about by
tho interference of Mayor Phelan in his
communication to Manager Vining on
this subject, and which has proven to be
so objectionable to the Mission residents,
â was acted on by a motion made by
Stephen A. Byrn, president of the Precita
Valley Club, requesting that the former
schedule of eight miles an hour be re
stored to all cars running Into the Mis
sion.
Tho all important matter of having an
outlet from the center of the city to San
Mateo County via Potrero avenue came
in for the major portion of the evening's
discussion. The law and the policy of
having this done brought out all the
eloquence of the speakers.
Chairman T. B. Slevin and Secretary J.
B. Vizzurd managed, however, to keep
the run of things pretty well and
strengthened the league by adding the
following delegates to the role: From the
James Lick and Wilmerding Club, J. W.
Felt, G. E. Merrill, J. W. Kerr, F. Hielms,
J. E. Kipp. John Haskins, M. Welsh. R.
Obert and J. M. Toner; from Precita Val
ley Club, J. J. Guilfoyle, W. McCaul and
Frank Powers.
One member from each club was ap
pointed as a committee to consider the
proposed charter and report at the next
meeting as to its worth as an organic law
for this city.
The proposition of making Potrero
avenue a boulevard was hooted down as
being a railroad job to prevent a compet
ing railroad from running in that direc
tion. It was suggested that either the
Suttcr-street or the San Mateo Company
would eventually extend its lines toward
the south to San Mateo County.

DEATH NOT DUE
TO ACCIDENT
Identification of a Body
Found on the Ferry-
Boat Solano.
Is That of Ephraim Fairchild,
an Aged Resident of
Sacramento.
Belief That HÂ« Committed Suicide by
Throwing Himself BeTor* thÂ«
Moving Cars.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARTINEZ April 6.â The mystery of
the Morgue has been solved and
through the efforts of Coroner Curry a
corpse which for several days has oc
cupied a marble slab has been identified
as that of Ephraim Fairchild of Sacra
mento. Last Thursday the remains of
the old man were found on the ferry
boat Solano at Port Costa. They had
been there all night and d?ath, it was
thought, had been caused by his being
run over by the cars. On the body was
$t> 65 In money and a check which in
dicated that Fairchi.v. i destination was
San Francisco. In his pockets were
two street-car transfers also.
An Inquest was held and a verdict
rendered that death was accidental, but
by many It Is believed to have been a
case of deliberate suicide, as his body
was lying across the track, the head
crushed and one leg almost cut off.
Coroner Curry did not feel like bury
ing the body in a rauper's trrave, as the
appearance of the deceased indicated i
that he had at one tl.ae been a man of :
means. He sent cards bearing a de-
BCriptlon of the dead man in every di- |
rection. but no responses were received
until yesterday when Oakland's Chief
of Police telephoned that he thought
the deceased had been in Jail there a
week ago and that in a talk with the
night captain he said he had a son in
Bakersfield. The Coroner followed up
the clew. He sent a telegram to C. H. i
Fairchild, station agent at Bakersfleld. ,
Fairchild came to Martinez to-day and :
immediately identified the remains as
those of his father.
Ephraim Fairchild was born in Brad
ford County, Pennsylvania, in 1802. He
was well-to-do. For the last forty
years he res\ded in Sacramento. He :
had not been in his right mind for some
time and persisted in roving around de
spite the protests of his son and wife.
Some time ago his wife was appointed
as his guardian.
Fairchild owned all of Chinatown at
Sacramento and had money in dif- j
ferent banks. His widow now resides
with Mr?. Judge Cross at Sacramento. ,
The remains will be shipped to the cap
ital to-morrow for interment

SLAUGHTER OF SQUIRRELS.
jaionterey County Pay 3 Bounty on
Thousands of Toils.
MONTEREY. April 6.â Since the Board
of Supervisors of Monterey County of
fered a bounty of 2 cents each on squir
rel tails there has been such a wholesale
slaughter of the pests that the Supervis
ors have decided to cease paying the
bounty at the end of the present month.
Since August 30, 1897, 43,481 tails have been
brought in. It is estimated that only
one-fourth of the squirrels killed could
be secured, the rest having died In their
burrows or In other inaccessible places.
According to this reckoning 173,924 squir
rels have been killed in this county in
seven months, and the County Super
visors think the pestâ which to Monterey
County farmers Is as great an annoyance
us the jack rabbit is to the ranchmen of
the San Joaquin Valley â has been reduced
to harmless proportions.

bled to-day a continuance of the Belew
case to Saturday was granted, at the
request of Belew's attorneys, who were

Hundreds of Devout Catholics
Perform Their Easter
Duty.
St Ignatius Church Crowded With
Penitents Yesterday Afternoon
and Evening.
The last and morft sacred uays in the
calendar of the Christian church are now
being solemnized in the various churches
throughout the city.
This Is the time when the Catholics
throughout the entire world are brought
in closer communion than at any other
time of the year with God by fasting,
praying and receiving the sacrament of
penance. The churches of this city are
crowded from morning until late at night
with worshipers, whose only thougnt is
that of God and their future happiness
with him on the shores of the great un
known. One has but to look in the large
Catholic edifices, such as St. Mary's Ca
thedral and St. Ignatius Church to prove
the truth of such assertions.
Here they will find hundreds and hun
dreds of penitents kneeling before the
altars or communicating with the Al
mighty in the narrow precincts of the
confessional. Fully uOO persons attended
St. Ignatius during yesteiuay afternoon
and evening, and as many more passed the
sacred portals of St. Mary's Cathedral.
Special services at the churches in honor
and commemoration of Holy Thursday
will be held this morning and evening.
The solemn high mass at the Cathedral
will be celebrated by Archbishop Riordan,
assisted by members of the clergy. A
procession of the blessed sacrament will
be held immediately after the offertory,
and will be participated in by the priests
of the church, the Christian Brothers of
Sacred Heart College and a number of ac
olytes. At the conclusion of the proces
sion the sacred host will be placed in the
tabernacle on St. Joseph"s altar, where
it will remain until after Good Friday.
During the celebration of mass the sacred
oils used in administering the sacraments
of confirmation, extreme unction and bap
tism will be consecrated by the Arch
bishop.
The services on Holy Thursday and
Good Friday at St. Ignatius Church will
be held at 8 o'clock in the mornin-. ilev.
Father Woods will deliver a sermon on
the blessed Sacrament this evening, fol
lowing which oenediction will be held.
From noon until 3 o'clock to-morrow af
ternoon there w... be the devotion of the
three hours of agony, at which Rev.
Father Neri, S. J., will deliver a sermon
un the "Last Seven Words Uttered by
Christ."

FOUR PURSES
TO FAVORITES
E. Come Ran Away With
Piggott and Sevens
Won Handily.
Eddie Jones Defeated His Com
pany in Commanding
Fashion.
MiÃÂ» Rowena Failed to Connect
ThÂ» Going Just Suited
Caspar.
The downpour of rain left the track at
Oakland In bad shape. The talent, from
.long experience, have grown wise, how
ever, and In the nix events decided yes
terday horses with short odds about
them crossed the wire first in four in
stances. â¢
Miss Rowena opened favorite for the
first event at five furlongs, receded in the
betting and was easily beaten by Blar
ney Stone, the second choice. The first
choice developed a bad streak of "dog"
In the stretch.
The ring laid I *â¢Â» 1 against Caspar iff
the opening betting on the eight siartoMj
in the mile and ;t sixteenth. He was n <^fl
mered down to 9 to Â£>, and, afu-r making^
all the running, won without much In fsjt
serve from Paul Pry. Thelma was &
close third. 4*
H. L. Frank's Montajia-bred co'.t, JSR
Come, was sent to the post an ewf
chance to win the four-furlong scramble
for 2-year-olds, and in a false breakaway
at the post ran away with Plggott. Seven
waa then rubbed to 9 to 10, and at the
â wire won bands down from La Pares
eeupe. Gold Scratch was third.
It is quite evident that Eddie Jones, the
brown Morello colt, is at home in heavy
going. He held sway in the betting on
the mile-and-a-furlong run for 3-year
olds, and, waiting on San Veuado and
l?orgia to the stretch, assumed the front
Eosltion and led Torsida past the judges
y four open lengths In 1:58*2-
Again the wise ones landed on the right
one in the mile-and-a-sixteenth selling
affair. Alvarudo, with H. Martin in the
p.'uldle, made an end-to-end affair of it,
winning eased up from Flashlight. Kews
gatherer, the second choice, was a poor
third.
A big plunge was made on Aima to take
th->. final six-furlong spin for mares, but
Thorp<- was unable to iar.d her inside the
money. Silver State was in front most
of the way. and ridden out, downed the
second choice. Lost Girl, a length. Show
honors went to Florimel.
Track Notes.
Satsuma was sent the Burn 3 Handicap rout*,
one mile and a quarter, yesterday, covering
the distance In 2:12... Buck Slassle was also
given on airing and looks fit to give somebody's
hnrse an argument. Candelaria went the dis
tance In 2:13. Some of the trainers think the
latter carried much rr.ore than his weight In
the handicap raJis for. Jimmy McCormlck,
though, di'i-lares the colt hasn't a chance.
Despite all the talk about weights, the fleid
in Saturdays big stake will he a larrre (.no,
*nd the betting will be a perplexing problem.
Handlcapper Brooks has shown in the past that
when he takes the time lie can handle welght-
B/jjustlnK to a nicety, and it really seems as
though h* should make the 110,000 stake his
master effort.
Caatake i ame out in the first after a pro
tracted vacation, and way well played to finish
in the attic. The gliding was evidently a bit
Ihort, ar.d should be worth a bet next time out
X not outclassed.
There was much adverse criticism over the
ride Charley Macklln put up on Santello. It
leems a strange fact that Macklln Invariably
r.eets with hard luck of swme sort when riding
i rt-prlced hor>e. He should reverse things,
tnd then people would not be given to gossip.
. the manner in which one or two bones
R'-re ridden in the second race, Caspar could
nave broken all four leffs and then rolled In
ft-ithout danger of being defeated.
The wise ones all sot aboard Alma in the
;ast race. When the barrier was released
Thorpe was unable to take the lead and was
nit oft at the far turn, ruining all chances.
Pedro Enos on Lost Girl evidently thought
;hat for the one special occasion the wire had
seen moved about 100 yards further away. Had
je ridden the mare vigorously from the head of
.he stretch, instead of reserving himself lor a
p-and stand tinish, the outsider, Silver State,
vould have been second instead of first.
Borgia made a lovely showing after his
luperli exhibition In the Derby. He galloped
!or about seven furlongs and then faded away
la though race tracks were not his game. It
Mold hardly be said the going did not suit
Jim. for during the early stages of the run
)lng the bay colt traveled as though right at
tome.

Chronic Eczema spread all over my head.
I had two doctors and tried lotions, but re-
ceived little benefit. Tho dreadful itching
became almost intolerable, and when I was
heated, the Eczema became painful, and
ilmost distracted me. Tried CrTicuÃA Rem-
edies, the Eczema rapidly disappeared, and I
tm well with no trace of any cutaneous disease. â 
J. EMMETT REEVES,
Feb. 22, 98. Box 125, Thorntown, Ind.
"Was afflicted with an itching rash all over
my body. I could not sleep, but was com-
pelled to Ho awake and scratch all the time.
My father and two brothers were afflicted with
the same thine We all suffered terribly for
% year and a half. Three cakes of Cuticutia
Boap and three boxes of Cdticcra (ointment)
Sitred the four of us completely.
Feb. 22, 1895. RICHARD ANDERSON,
Geneva, Box Elder Co., Utah.
My hands vere completely covered with
Eczema, and between my fingers ibo skin was
perfectly raw. I could get no ease. night or
day. I was in a raga of itching. Sly husband
had to dress and undress rue like a baby.
The test physicians' medicines gavo me no
relief, and drove roe almost crazy. I used
the COTICCRA (ointment), and fire minutes
after the first application I teat perfectly easy,

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 7, 1898.
was a myptlc maze composed of barb wire
just outside of Hornitos. He found the
center of the maze one evening at about
7 o'clock and it was about an hour after
midnight when he found the way out.
He is still taking up the rents in his
clothing. The following morning Jordan
and a cow became aware of each other's
presence at about the same time. The
cow was wearing a brindle hide, a dewlap
and a tail, while Jordan was attired in
a bright red sweater. The ensuing race
was one of the most exciting in the his
tory of mountain sport, and was won by
Jordan, who beat the cow to a five-barred
hurdle by about a length, though ho
failed to clear the ditch on the other side.
The afternoon of the same day this won
derful discoverer became possessed of a
piece of information that will linger in
his memory when many another fact
shall have faded away and been for
gotten, namely, the surprising force with
which a man can fall from a horse whose
back looks, to the observer standing in
the road, to be not over three feet from
the ground.
Mr. Jordan wanted a horse and. after
some trouble, a small beast of buckskin
tendencies and uncertain temperament
was procured. The animal was led up
to where that gentleman was standing
telling an admiring crowd of fellow re
porters of how he used to break his own
string when he worked at cow punching,
and stood quietly enough waiting for Joe
to finish; but as soon as that gentleman
had concluded and started to mount him
a cha-nge came over the beast's demeanor.
He sidled this way and that, and it was
only with the help of half a dozen by
standers that his temporary rider was
at length enabled to mount into the sad
dle, where he remained for exactly
thirteen seconds, and then hit the road
with such force that, when his friends
came to his assistance, he said: "Don't
touch me, boys; the top of my head is
cracked clear around, and if you joggle
me it will fall off like the top of a split
cocoanut Just tell my wife my last
thoughts were of her, and leave me to
die in peaces"
It was found, however, that things were
not as bad as he imagined. He had, for
tunately, fallen on his face, so no partic
ular harm waa done.

eye. but still retains his penchant for gaining
his base on balls.
Sullivan of Sacramento is one of the clever
est catchers In the California Leacue. He is
a hard sticker, too.
Unhappy Mc.Guckln Is playing better ball this
year man he dH last. He Is splitting the
seams of the ball. too.
It is a pity that the Olympics cannot keep
Pompadour Jim on their team, as they are
much in need of a hard hitter.
Infant Hardie has his lamps trimmed In the
right focus. All he needs now is a pair of
roller-skates for use on the paths.
"Smiling" Mike Stetffanl still retains his
cleverness as a pitcher, but Captain McGucken
should try and retrain his wildness.
Henry Krug has Jumped from the California
to the Pacific States League. Yesterday he
pitched for Oakland against Santa Cruz.
Charlie Pelno has Joined the =Â»irkton Cali
fornia League team. A new outfielder named
Egan, fri>m the south, has also been secured.
Manager Young nf the Sacramento Giants
has signed Marshall of Spokane to play second.
He Is said to be a hard striker and fast fielder.
Who ever accused "Truck" Eagen of being
a pitcher? "Truck" should be given his old
position at second, a position he fills to a
nicety.
"Blookers" Hanley catches in oli-tlme style,
and us soon as the old man Eets In form that
left swing of his will send the sphere for a

Kube Levy was a little too lenient yesterday
in giving Corbett thf credit of two double

results. He Iras a strong team that will be

Phil Knell, McHale, Newbert and the others
are playing tne same of their lives.
There is a great curiosity to see the Stock
tons at Recreation Park. Several old-time fa

League. Hughie used to play with the old
Pioneers, but is row a special officer.
Pyne, who was released from the San Fran
cisco California League team, has signed with
the Oakland T '- "-â¢ Ptntes team. He Is a
terrific batter, but an indifferent fielder.
The Jog In cenfr-field" fence at Recreation
Park has been set bork sixteen feet, and 1b
to be placed still further back. This will give
ample room for long drives Into that region.
Most of the Sa^.i-mpnto giants are left
handed batters, and while able to give right
handed pitchers that feeling of languor so
often spoken of, are at the mercy of port-side
twirlers.
If handsome Mr. Keegan played under his
risht name he would receive credit for any
good play, but as It is to say anything nice
about him seems like giving space on false
pretenses.
Nick Young lias ordered Umpire Jim McDon
ald not to referee any more boxing matches,
an unwarranted Interference on Young's part.
He has always been regarded as a false alarm
by Callforalans.
If the managers of the Pacific States League
would give "Br-ther" Joe Corbett a chance in
the box he would have an opportunity to re
deem himself, for if there is one thing Joe
can do it Is pitch.
Joo Corbett Bhould take a few lessons from
his brother Jim In batting and he -vill then
prove a valuable man. Joe did great work
with the Baltimore* last season. What's the
matter, Joeâ stage fright? Smoke up!
The running of free cars from Eighth and
Mark-t streets to Recreation Park last Satur
day ami Sunday had a most beneficial effect on
the attendance at the sanies there. The rail
road Will continue to ran free cars every day
games are played until the road is changed to
an electric lir.>*.
The npw Fresro grounds were formally
opened yesterday, although the grand stand Is
nut quite completed. They are one of the
linest ball grounds In the State. The Fresno
Tigers will make their first appearance at
Recreation Park next Sunday, when they will
meet the San Franeiscos.
Some time Â«co it was announced that the
left fleUI at Central Park was to be moved
back, but nothing hats been done yet toword
this much-needed Improvement, and fielders
continue to bump up against the boards and
watch the ball sail over for two-base hits that
would be easy outa if there was room enough
to field the ball.
There will bo no California League game at
Recrr-ation Park next Saturday, as the grounds

Kastern battery will make their bow before
the San Francisco cranks, when they will go
against the San Franctscos.
Joe Corbett Is considering the advisability of
Jumping his contract with Baltimore and re
maining on the coast this season. Joe has
under advisement an offer or J2OOO to pitch for
the Oakland Pacific States League team for the
ppas.,n, and he may accept the offer. Rumor
has it that If Joe decides to go East he will
leave his heart behind him, and rather than
separate himself fn.m that vital organ he will
forfeit his contract.
Iherg is reported to have signed with the
Pan Jose Pacific States League Club. Iberg is
one of the best Itchera In the State, and his
acquisition will strengthen the team where It
Is most needed, U it has been lamentably
wealc In the delivery department. The young
ster has fnllen heir to a good thing, if reports
are true, for he is credited with having been
given the position of bookkeeper In the blit
brewery there at a salary of $ir.o a month, with
permission to absent himself whenever he
chooses to practice or play with the team.
George Borchera ha-s been heard from. The
old timer writes fr mi Sacramento to a friend
In tills city thru ho has been tnkinÃ excellent
enre of himself of lute, and that he can pitch
better ball than ever before. He would like
to be plven a trial by some or trie teams here.
Jim Corbet t must be makinp money by the
hat full, judslnjr from the manner in which
he rejects an opportunity to pick up a few hun
dred dollars In a couple of hours. Jim was
pnld a handsnrnp FU ni for his appearance at
Central Park Inst Sunday, and the Oakland
team offered him the same amount to play
with them next Sunday, hut Jim replied that
It would be his last Sunday at home for a lons
time and he preferred to remain with his
family.
Christian Association Meetings.

LEGISLATION
FOR HAWAII
Defeat of the Plan to
Increase the House
Members.
Representatives Will Also Vote
Down the Bill to Raise the
Salary of Ministers.
During the Floods at the Islands
There Have Been Four Deaths and
Many Acts of Heroism.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, X roh 30.â The bark S.
C. Allen, having sped down from the
coast in a few hours less than ten
days, arrived in port some six hours
ahead of the China with the news in
regard to the annexation contest, but
the bulk of the mail arrived by the
Moana this morning.
It appears stranTe to contemplate,
but as usual the "private advices" re-
ceived by the Government and also by
its opponents are equally hopeful and
flattering.
Practically the only Hem of general
interest from i le Legislature is the fact
that the House of Representatives has
defeated the amendment to the consti
tution to increase the number of rep
resentatives from fifteen to twenty
three. The vote was a tie of 7 to 7,
but the Speaker, John Lota Kaulukow,
after a long speech, cast his vote
against the bill. It may be interesting
to know that the Speaker was elected
by 175% votes at the last election, and
that he was selected as Speaker of the
House on account of his oratorical pow
ers, and as past legislative experience
has proved, a flow of words to which
the simile of a mountain torrent fed
by a cloud-burst would be tame. Mr.
Kaulukou has held high office, having
been Postmaster-General, Tax Asses
sor in Chief and Marshal. He is a law
yer by profession and a handsome,
portly man, bearing somewhat of a re
semblance to the late King Kalakaua.
A judgeship will probably be the ad
ministration's douceur to him for his
political services.
It is difficult to ascertain the true
motive of its action, but it is under
stood that the House intends to cruelly
slaughter the bill to increase the sal
aries of ministers to $6000 a year, on
the grounds that the ministers have not
themselves asked for an increase and
do not desire it, and the people know
ingly smile at their innocence and pa
triotism. The fact probably is that it
is not deemed desirable to make the
perquisites of a portfolio sufficiently
tempting to attract political competi
tors, the patronage in itself being suf
ficiently valuable from a politician's
standpoint.
In spite of the urging of the press, for
once combined on the issue, and popu
lar clamor, the proposed amendments
to, or repeal of, the penal contract la
bor laws appear to sullenly hang fire.
It is felt in higher circles that such leg
islation would be disastrously "inoppor
tune." Eventually the measure, toned
down, will probably pass the House and
be safely "dosed" in the Senate.
The policy of the Government now is
to go in heavily for public improve
ments, especially in the line of develop
ing our internal means of communica
tion. The roads contemplated will fur
nish employment to a vast number of
men now unemployed. It is felt that
some such policy must be seriously pur
sued to prevent labor troubles, more
especially as the improvements con
templated will add materially to the
resources and revenue of the country.
The proposed adoption of the income
tax law will have to be abandoned for
this session, for it is understood that
the executive and the Cabinet have
joined the opposition forces. The op
position is not based against the prin
ciples of the system, but against the
methods and the present "inopportune
ness" of disturbing the revenue sys
tem.
We are now in the sixty-sixth day of
rain and stormy weather, and floods
have been prevalent all over the is
lands, washing away a number of
bridges and causing disastrous dam
age. In Honolulu, on the 24th, a freshet
caused the Minanu stream to burst its
bounds and flood a considerable district.
One life was lost, that of a Japanese,
after a really heroic endeavor at res
cue at the imminent peril of his Ufa
by William Wells, a sailor on the R. P.
Rithet. Wells has been rewarded by
the Japanese Minister and residents
with a testimonial and a watch, and
the townspeople wili present him with
a gold medal and a purse.
Another gallant roscu^ from the swol
len stream was that of a pupil of St.
I.,ouis College, Buto, by his schoolmate,
Morris. Considering the juvenile ago
of the boys it was almost marvelous.
So far as reports have arrived from
the other islands about four lives, As
iatics,, were lost.
Japanese Yellow Journalism.
â Ruzzo Washlzo. editor of the Azohi
zushl, a weekly newspaper published in
this city, was Indicted by the United
States Grand Jury last Tuesday on a
charge of publishing obscene matter. The
complainant is another Jap, the editor
of the Chrysanthemum, a rival publi
cation. The alleged obscenity consists of
a play upon words In an article criticizing
the editor of the Chrysanthemum, the
words used having two meanings, one
Innocent and the other vulgar.
He Failed to Appear.
W. H. sellings, the San Pablo rancher,
charged with threatening to kill his wife
failed tro appear in Judge Campbell's court
yesterday, and a bench warrant was is
sued for his arrest. His bonds were fixed
at $1000. The case was continued till to
morrow.

THE SAME BOARD
WAS APPOINTED
Southern Pacific Stockholders
Make No Change in
Their Directors.
The Bnlanoe of Power Still Swings
Toward C. P. Huntington, Who
Will BÂ« Re-elected.
The regular annual meeting: ofthestock
holders of the Southern Pacific Company,
which was held yesterday, resulted in
the following board of directors being
elected: George Crocker, C. E. Green,
Thomas H. Hubbard, C. P. Huntington,
H. E. Huntington, J. Kruttschnitt,
Charles G. Lathrop, N. T. Smith, T. E.
Stillman, J. C. Stubbs and Russell J.
Wilson.
The new board Is the same as the old j
one, with the exception of C. E. Green, I
who is simply there to represent Will ;
Crocker, now absent in Europe, and who
will resign to allow his place to be filled
by Mr. Crocker upon that gentleman's
return from his trip.
The board, it will be seen, still gives the
controlling interest to the Huntingtun
faction, which is represented by five of
the directors, not including Hubbard and
Stillman, who represent the Searle stock,
and who may be considered as Hunting
ton men. George Crocker and Green rep
resent the Crocker interests, while the
only votes that the Stanford people can
control in the present board are those of
Charles G. Lathrop and R. J. Wilson.
It could not be ascertained the amount
of stock that was voted, but a fair esti
mate would place it between 1,300 ,uu0 ana
1 ,r>'.Â»o,ooo shares.
To-day the directors will meet and elect
the officers for the ensuing year. While
nothing definite can be stated as to what
man has been marked out for any partic
ular position, it is a foregone conclusion,
with the composition of the board as
it is, that C. P. Huntington will have
himself re-elected president, and the men
who will fill the less important positions
will be those whom he wishes there.
As there has been no rumor of any par
ticular dissatisfaction, on the part of
Huntington. with the men who have
filled the different offices for the past year,
it is more than probable that the same
gentlemen will be re-elected to fill tho
same positions for the ensuing twelve
months.
Government Dove Cotes.
A. Carlisle, one of the most enthusiastic
fanciers of homing pigeons in the State,
has prepared a lon â¢ petition to be pre
sented to the large commercial bodies of
this city for their indorsement. When
signed it will be forwarded to Secretary
of the Navy John Long, and will recite
that the memorialists are engaged in busi
ness concerning the sea, and asking that
the cote of homing pigeons now main
tained by the Government at Mare Island
be removed to Goat Island, in the bay of
San Francisco, and albO that a cote be
established on the South Farallon Island.
The reasons for this request are that
Goat Island is situated midway between
Oakland and San Francisco and can be
reached in half an hour, while it will take
at least two hours to reach the Mare
Island cote in case the birds shouid be
wanted, i hese birds could be used for
the benefit of the vast snipping that goes
and comes to this harbor. A cote on the

FIGHT WITH
A THIEF
Mrs. Lena Marcus Ar
rests a Man Who
Robbed Her.
Detecting Him in the Act
She Promptly Seizes
Him.
After an Exciting Encounter
She Turns Him Over to
the Police.
HIS PAL ALSO CAPTURED.
Eoth Men Taken to thÂ« City Prison
and Charged With Petty
Larceny.
Mrs. Lena Marcus, who conducts a
second-hand store at 1028 Howard
street, had an exciting encounter with
a thief last night-
Shortly after 7 o'clock a well-dressed
young man entered her place of busi
ness and pretended to be anxious to
purchase a suit of clothes. While she
was engaged in looking over the stock
of clothes, intending to pick out a suit
which would meet with his approbation,
the stranger stole a hat which he con
cealed under his coat. Mrs. Marucs de
tected h'm in the act and ordered him
to replace it.
With an oath the stranger started
after her, evidently intending to "do
her up," as she expressed it. Realizing
that the man meant business the brave
w.'inan determined to make a tight in
the hope erf recovering the stolen prop
erty.
As the thief aimed a vicious blow at
her she cleverly evaded it and, seizing
him by the arm, lustily shouted for the
police. His confederate, who was stand
ing in the doorway, shouted to him to
"break away " just as Police Officer
Bmith appeared on the scene. Smith
grabbed the "look-out," and after a
Short struggle succeeded in haxidc. fling
him.
In the meantime Mrs. Marcus had se
cured a sort of half Nelson hold on
the nrst visitor, and as the officer en
she turned him over to him. The
Stolen hat was discovered under the
a coat and they were both taken
to the City Prison and charged with
petty larceny.
The individual who purloined the
headgear gave his name as Michael
Norton, and his occupation as that of
a blacksmith. His accomplice gave
his name as T. W. Smith.
In telling her story last night Mrs.
Marcus said that Norton entered her
Btore and said he was anxious to pur-
Chase a pair of pants.
"Thinking be was in earnest," she re
marked, "1 started to pick out a suit
able garment and when my back was
turned he stole the hat, which was on
the counter. lat once seized him and
ordered him to put the hat back. For
a reply he attempted to strike me and
I then caught hold of him. He vainly
endeavored to get away, but I was de
termined to hold him until a police of
ficer arrived. Just as my strength was
failing me Policeman Smith appeared
in response to my cries and he placed
him and his pal under arrest."
Mrs. Marcus Is a rather frail woman
and her pluck in enpturing the thief
was the topic of conversation at police
headquarters last night.
KNOCKED OUT
IN TWO ROUNDS
Billy Dierks, a Featherweight,
Easily Defeated by Jack
Terit.
A Good Entertilnment Furnished by
tho San FrÂ«ncleoo Athletio
Club.
George Bates and Ous Korater fought
six rounds last night to decide the light
weight championship of the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club. The decision was
given to Korster by Jack Stelzner. who
acted as referee. Had Stelzner called it
a draw the decision would have proved
more acceptable to the spectators. Kors
ter forced the fighting from start to lln
lsh, and for that reason he was given
the decision. Both men were badly wind
ed at the end of the contest, for It was
a give-and-take match throughout. Bates
)s quick and shifty, but last night had an
overstock of confidence on hand. In the
first round he acted as If he believed he
could "drop" Korster Just when he
pleased. A few stiff Jolts on the jaw
Foon convinced him that he did not have
a picnic on hand. He Kept off after that,
allowing Korster to do the leading, ex
pecting to get In a right-hand swing. The
expected opening did not come, however.
When the gong sounded the end of the
Bixih round both men were distressed.
It was a clever and game fight, however,
and had it been to a finish It would be
difficult to say who would have corao
out victor.
Jack Granfield was given a decision
over Charles Dixon in a six-round bout
preliminary to the "main event." Dixon
had the advantage of reach and height,
but did not show to advantage. He start
ed In to cut the pace In the first round,
but a couple of punches caused h'm to
change his programme. GranlieM had him
going several times, but lacked the steam
to land the finishing blow.
BUI} Dierks and Jack Terit were booked
for a four-round bout to settle the feath
er-weight championship of the club. Terit
Fettled the question In the second round
by a right-hand swing, sending Dierks
through the ropes and out. Dicrks should
not be given another match until he has
been taught a few lessons In decency. All
during the contest he indulged In profan
ity, and kepi applying vile epithets to
Terit. When his mouth v.as closed by the
Knockout blow every one felt that he had
July received what he properly deserved.
The other number on the programme
jvas a friendly .three-round bout between
Gene Mulligan and Tom Devine.

The assignment of General Sehofield to
the duty of commanding the armies of
the United States in the event of war
With Spain would not cause surprise in
military circles. General Schofield is on
the retired list, but holds the rank of
lieutenant general. Should he be called
into active service by the President his
rank would be preserved. Army officers
on the retired list are not out of the ser
vice by any moans, but are expected to
perform any military duty to which they
may be assigned. Schofield is a leader of
courage, discretion and enterprise. His
\v;ii- record gives ample proof of his hero-
Ism and coolness under fire. He fought in
the civil war from the start to the tinish,
and pained his advancement by the excel
lence of his service. At the battle of
Wilson's Cret?k, where General Nathaniel
i.y<.:i fell at the head of the column,
Schofield gained renown for the masterly
manner in which he handled a battery of
regular artillery. During the famous At
lanta campaign Schofield commanded the
Army of the Ohio, and actively partici-
pated in many engagements. He planned
and fought the battle of Franklin, suc
cessfully resisting the most desperate
charge made during the war by the Con
federates. In point of numbers slain the
charge of Pickett's division at Gettys
burg was a small affair compared with
Hood's assault at Franklin.
Although on the retired list. General
Schofield is an active and vigorous man.
With Sehofield in command of all the land
forces and the director of the campaign,
Miles would have free rein for his ac
tivity as a tield marshal. General Gran
ville M. Dodge, an able engineer officer,
who commanued a department under
Grant and fcherman during the war, and
gained great distinction as the command
er of the Sixteenth Army Corps, in cne
battle of Atlanta, is very close to General
Schofield. Grant':; book and Sherman's
memoirs bear testimony to the value of
General Douge's services during the civil
war. '
Generals Howard, Stanley. McCook, the
Forsythes, Huttertield, McMahon, Lew
Wallace, King and many other uflicers of
distinction stand read}' to respond to the
call oi' duty.
No doubt an important command will be
tendered to General Fitzhugh Lee. He is
a letider of men and a soldier of superior
attainments. A campaign in Cuba would
probably present opportunities for cav
alry leaders to gain special prestige. Gen
eral Merritt is a rider of renown, and has
probably lust none of his dash since the
war. Troopers now in the service be
lieve that Colonel David S. Gordon,
U. S. A. (retired), would come to the front
at once. Gordon is a rider and a raiuer
among ten thousand.
It is common talk at the Presidio that
the regular troops stationed at that gar
rison will not be disturbed; -yet if the
policy of sending regulars to Cuba and
calling out the National Guard to garri
son home posts be adopted, the First In
fantry and the four companies of the
Fourth Cavalry at the Presidio might be
hustled off to the front on short notice.
It is regarded as pretty well settled that
the Government cannot safely detach any
of the artillery from this station. In fact,
more artillerymen are needed to man the
guns already in position.
Lieutenant-Colonel Louis T. Morris,
commanding the squadron of cavalry at
the Presidio, has a record for gallant and
effective service as a leader of mounted
men. Should the Fourth Cavalry be or
dered to the front the command might de
volve upon Colonel Morris. Colonel S. B.
M. Young, formerly of the Fourth Cav
alry, is a rider of recognized ability and
vigor. The only time the Presidio reser
vation ever seemed small was when Gen
eral Graham and Coionel Young we're
stationed there. General Graham now
commands the largest and most important
of the military departments, ihe enlisted
men say there is no better soldier alive
than "Billy" Graham.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 7, 1898.
A LIFE'S ROMANCE.
A Beautiful Singer and His Intended Bride.
Ricardo Juan Jose and Miss Esther Therese Schrieve.
The engagement of Ricardo Juan Jose,
the famous counter tenor, who a few
weeks ago electrified the public of this
city with his phenomenal voice, to Miss
Esther Therese Schrieve. the beautiful
niece of Mrs. Theresa F. Parrott. has
been announced, and comes as a genuine
surprise to the friends oosf s the young
couple.
Although it had been the intention of
keeping the engagement a secret until
Mr. Jose fulfilled his contracts in the
East, the attempt, owing to the popular
ity of Miss Schreive, and the fame of her
intended husband, proved fruitless and
the news was finally divulged.
The announcement is the outcome of a
long existing mutual attachment between
the young people, dating as far back as
early childhood and forming a love ro
mance of many years. It was in Vir
ginia City, Nov., that Cupid first began
his pranks, and the dual target at which
he aimed his fatal darts proved of a re
ceptive and easily impressionable nature.
Since 1595 they have had an understand
ing as to the probable outcome of their
affections, but it was not until a month
ago that they began their formal engage
ment. At this time Jose, who came to
the coast simply to visit his sweetheart,
and arrange for the celebration of their
a staging provided by the defendant cor
poration was insecure, and that in conse
quence Woodhead. who was In the employ
of the company, fell a distance of thirty
five feet and was killed.
STRIKE CONDITION UNCHANGED
Printers and Employers Alike Claim
to Be Gaining Ground.
There were practically no new develop- j
ments in the printers' strike yesterday, !
and the fight seems to be about neck and |
neck. Both sides can tell how the others
are losing ground, and each offers to
back up its assertions with equally good
proof. The printers say that the men se
cured by the Typothetae are for the most
part incompetents and that many were
discharged after a day's trial; while the
Typothetae claims that its members can
secure all the help needed, and offer as a
proof that they are filling all orders on
time and the work is up to the usual
standard.
The union claims that the members of
the Typothetae have bonded themselves
to hold together, and that these bonds
have about expired; while the Typothetae
admits the existence of the bonds, but
claims that they are issued for an in
definite time.
This is the way it was going all day.
Whatever statement one side would make
the other was just as ready to deny, and |
there has been litfle or no advantage i
gained on either side. All look to next j
week as the time for the. final settlement I
of the difficulties in the most important
places. The strikers are maintaining the
usual quiet demeanor which has marked
the strike from the start, and what little
disturbances have taken place have been
caused by feeder-boys or totally irrespon
sible parties.
Printing Pressmen lUeet.
A meeting of the Printing Pressmen
was held last evening, the chief feature
of which was the annual election of olfi
cers and the voting of a 10 per cent
assessment on working members to aid
the strikers. Out of courtesy only the
working members were allowed to vote
on the proposition, but It was carried
unanimously. It was reported that one
of the new pressmen at Crocker's estab
lishment had succeeded in running his
hand through one of the largest presses.
Both the man and press are now badly
disabled. The officers elected were as fol
lows: S. P. Kane, president; D. Doggett,
vice-president; E. Breiling, treasurer; W.
S. Everleth, recording secretary; F. E.
Caler, financial secretary. S. E. Kane
was elected delegate to the International
Convention.
CAPTAIN MOORE'S SWORD.
It Is Presented by Its Owner to Com
panies C and G of the N. Q. C.
Last Monday night at the meeting of
Companies C and G (the Nationals), N.
G. C, Colonel J. B. Moore, retired, who
was first lieutenant of Company C in ISOS,
when it was organized, and was captain
from 1557 to ISCI. when he severed his
connection with the company to serve in
the war of the rebellion, presented the
Nationals the sword he carried during
the war.
The sword was received by Captain
Sutliffe of Company G, who in so doing
mn.de a patriotic speech that created
much enthusiasm.
Colonel Moore served in the Mexican
war from the beginning to the close" as
a private and in 1861 organized a com
pany of volunteers that was mustered
in the Third regiment of California vol
unteers. Colonel Moore, who was then
a member of the police force, was com
missioned as captain of company B, and
the sword he placed in the keeping of the
Nationals was presented to him in Octo
ber, IS6I, by the San Francisco Police
Department.

marriage the last part of this or the
commencement of next year, was induced
by the managers of a local theater to
give a number of recitals in the city.
Although known all over the world for
his gifted voice, he came to this city
practically unknown, but like all other
large cities where he had visited, he left
it with additional jewels in his cap of
fame.
The young singer comes from an old
English family and was born in Cornwall,
England, twenty-eight years ago. He is
the son of Richard Jose, who before his
death was the greatest tenor in Europe.
At the age of 12 years he left his native
land and, without money or friends,
worked his way to America to seek his
fortune in the new world.
Upon arriving in this country he settled
in Philadelphia for a short time, but be
coming discontented with his lot he made
his way to this coast and settled in Ne
vada, making his permanent residence
there for many years.
It was while working in a blaeksmlth
ing shop in Virginia City that his mar
velous voice was iirst discovered, and a
short while afterward he first touched
the ladder of fame by giving an exhibi
tion of his vocal ability in one of the
theaters in the "Mining City." His suc

Supposed Eastern Crocks, Will Be
Charged With the Rubbery.
George Marsh nnd Maurice Hicks are
In "the tanks" at the City Prison and to
day v/ill have a charge of robbery booked
against them.
Tuesday An tone Hartman, a miner at
the coal mines at Corral Hollow, Alameda
County, arrived in the city and about 5
o'clock in the afternoon he was in the
White Cruiser saloon on East street. He
had been drinking a little and was in the
condition to make himself generally
agreeable. He did not like to drink by
himself and asked two men who were
standing at the bar to join him. They
had a few drinks together and Hartman
then said he womd nave to go home.
The two men, who were Marsh and
Hicks, objected to parting with such a
good friend, and suggested that they
should walk a bit of the way with him.
The three left the saloon together and
when they reached Drumm street, be
tween Merchant and Washington, Marsh
asked Hartman to tell him the time.
Hartman pulled out his watch and Marsh
took hold of the chain. Hartman told
him to let go and Marsh, jerking, the
watch out of his pocket, struck him a
blow on the jaw with his fist that
knocked him down. The two robbed him
of his watch, and were going through his
pockets when they got scared from his
cries for help and ran away.
Hartman. as soon as he regained his
feet, chased Marsh, who run in the direc
tion of the water front, but lost sight of
him after running two or three blocks.
Hartman met Policeman Dower and told
him the story of the robbery. Together
they went to the Clay-street wharf, where
the Stockton boat, Captain Weber, was
making preparations to sail, and Hartman
pointed out Marsh and Hicks as the men
who had robbed him.
Dower placed the two men under arrest
and took them to the City Prison, wnere
they were loc..ed up in the "tanks." Yes
terday morning Ilartman, who had been
detained as a witness, positively identitied
Marsh as the man who had taken his
watch and hit him on the jaw, knocking
him down. He was not so sure about
Hirky, and Dower got Kelly, 'the pro
prietor of the Sciloon, to go to the prison
to see if he could identity them, x^eny
looked at the two men. but would not
BWear positively that either of n.em was
in his saloon, as it was generally crowded
about 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
Hartman was prepared to swear to a
complaint yesterday afternoon charging
the two men with robbery, but as no war
rant clerk was at hand he was detained
in the prison until this morning, when he
will swear to the complaints. A sailor on
the Captain Weber was drinking in the
saloon with Hartman and the two prison
ers at the time they left, and when the
stramer arrives this morning: he will be
taken to the prison --> identify them.
Marsh and K. us are strangers here,
having recently come from the East, and
Chief I>es vill make inquiries as to their
past recordt.

Second Street Residents Protest
Against the Delayed Obsequies
of a Well-Done Canine.
An indignant citizen writes to the Board
of Health that the unloved remains of a {
large dog that had escaped shanghaing i
to the Klondike only to fall a victim to
the more rapid fate of a metropolitan
career had been denied proper interment !
for a week or more, and is still lying i
in an overripe condition about four feet !
from the sidewalk en Second street, near i
Harrison. The canine is protesting ]
against the neglect of the city scavenger
to the full extent of his powers, consider
ing his defunct state, and residents of the
neighborhood, who hourly scent this pro
test, are unanimous in their consent to ;
have the obseauies take place without
delay; in fact the letter is addressed to
the board in the hope that they may be j
hurried along some. The departed's un- j
Intentional offense is aggravated by the !
neglect on the part of the authorities to |
have the remains properly embalmed. ;
The letter is accompanied by a photo
graph of the unclaimed sausage stulling
I as proof that the petition is no josh. The.
: health officers sympathize with the ;
â  mourners, but as the Supervisors are the ;
| proper authorities to direct the last rites, j

Charles E. Trower, as assignee of the
estate of D. M. Boolman, an Insolvent
debtor, has begun suit In the Justice's
Court to recover $149 from the" Labor Ex

Great Benevolences.
In the large cities of the United States the
condition of the metropolitan poor Is constantly
being ameliorated by the grand benevolences of
wealthy people. Sanitary reforms are fre
quently suggested and carried out with earnest
ness and intelligence. Among sanitary reforms
those produced by Hostetter's Stomach Bitters

An Official From Nicaragua
Talks on the Canal and
Other Matters.
Merry Not Persona Non Orata, but
His Official Residence Remains
In Costa Rica.
At the Palace Hotel Is staying a promi
nent resident of Nicaragua, who occu
pies, under his own Government, a posi
tion corresponding to an American col
lector of customs, only, instead of hav
ing authority over one port, his jurisdic
tion extends throughout the whole State.
When seen In his apartments last night
this gentleman said: "This talk of a war
between Nicaragua and Costa Rica is all
bosh. True, there are some disappointed
and disaffected people who, for political
and other reasons, have been obliged to
flee the country, and who hang around
the Costa Rican border and try to stir
up revolutions. But they are compara
tively few in number and could, even if
in the territory of the State they are try-
Ing to embroil, do no harm. The people
of Nicaragua are too well satisfied with
the President and his administration to
attempt to overthrow it, and while there
may be a little jealousy over the canal
question between the two countries, it
does not nor will it ever ajnount to any
thing more than a strong business rivalr>
or mercantile war. President Zelaya is
the most popular man who has been at
the head of the Government for a long
time and is liked and respected by not
only the wealthy and influential people
of the country, but by the masses as
well. He is a man of broad mind am
liberal views and has an education tha
fits him to meet and impress the most
highly polished and best-educated of the
foreign representatives that are sent to
his capital.
â¢'Of course, the one topic o-. continual
interest in my part of the world is the
probable completion of the great canal.
When the commission under Admiral
Walker arrived on the Charleston the
entire country turned out to do it honor,
and there was no reasonable concession
it could not have nad for the asking. We
Central Americans realize that our future
and mat of the United States are so in
terwoven that it behooves us to give as
much as we can to the Americans in or
der that we ourselves may profit thereby.
Consequently, while the American com
mission got everything they wanted and
the utmost deference was paid to it, the
representatives of English capital re
ceived but little encouragement. The
Walker commission went into the matter
to its smallest detail, and when it had
finished its Investigations it came to the
conclusion that instead of $180,000,000
being needed, the canal could be easily
finished in four years and at a cost that
would not exceed $50.000.000 at the outside
"How does Captain Merry get along 0
First rate, i'ou see, at the time of his
appointment there was some difficult>
that but very few people up here under
stood. The Greater Republic of Centra
America consists of a union of the three
States of Nicaragua. Salvador and Hon
duras. They have agreed to leave all in
ternational questions to a diet forme<
from delegates accredited from each of
the three States. Captain Merry was ap
pointed Consul at this port from Nica
ragua, and when it was decided to official
ly decapitate him it was done by the
diet and not by any one particular State.
Consequently, while he was a persona non ,
grata to the diet as a whole, he was a
persona grata to the State of Nicaragua j
individually. The official residence of the |
American Minister has always been in i
Nicaragua, but Captain Merry, since his
appointment, has resided in Costa Rica,
where he will continue until the little
'unpleasantness attending his appointment
has been definitely settled.
"As to the sentiment of the Central
American people in the matter of a prob
able war with Spain. Well, our interest
certainly lies with the cause of the United
States. In a war between Spain and
Cuba we are certainly for the Cubans.
But war between Spain and the United
States Is a different matter. Blood Is
thicker than water. Spaniards and Cen
tral Americans are all Latin and of one

GRAND JURY
FINDS FRAUD
Found Worthless Con
crete in a Lombard
Street Crossing.
A Section Made In Accordance
With the Speci
fications.
Comparison Instituted With thÂ« Ma
terial Taken From tiiÂ»
Crossing.
Some Interesting: and Important ex*
periments in > ncrete have been mada
by the Grand Jury. Yesterday posi
tive proof was obtained that only a
small quantity of cement was used for
the concrete bed of a cr< sslns- on Lom
bard street which was paved with
bituminous rock by the City Street Im
provement Company. The cement was
lacking both in quality and quantity.
In order to ascertain whether thd
specifications as provided by the con
tract were complied with, the enter
prising Grand Jury had a quantity of
concrete made according to the letter of
the specification, and this sample waa
compared with a section of the concrete
taken from the Lombard street cross-,
ing.
The physical test of the concrete
taken from the street crossing show*
that the mater 'al is deficient in every
requirement. The interstices are not
filled, and the material is so flimsy and
sandy that one i.iay run a lead pencil
through the substance. The section
constructed by the Grand Jury accord
ing to the letter of the specifications i 3
firmer and more enduring: than the ma
terial taken from the crossing, yet the
interstices are not filled as they should
be, which indicates that the specifica
tions were somewhat faulty.
The contractor for the Lombard
street work cli.ims that the test i,s not
a fair one as the concrete was laid on
a clay foundation. The Grand Jury will
proceed further and make tests of con
crete laid on sand foundation. Several
sections of accepted pavement in vari
ous parts of tie city will be subjected
to the comparative tests.
The proof, however, is already pro
duced that the concrete or. the Lom
bard street crossing in nuestion wag
not mixed as the specifications direct
ed. Only a small quantity of cement
was used, - " what was used did not
come up to the "rade of third-class ce
ment.
THEATRICAL NOTES.
The "Bohemian Girl" lias but two more
nights at the Tivnli. the new Easter piece.
"Sinbad the Sailor," taking the stage on
Saturday night. "Sinbad" has been in
preparation for several months, and it is
said that the scenery, costumes and other
fittings have been selected with the idea
of a long run for the new burlesque. The
cast will include Helen Merrill, "Bob"
Mitchell, Carrie Roma, Edwin Stevens,
Thomas Leary and a large number of
subsidiary people.
"Shore Acres" is still a strong popular
attraction at the Columbia, where It will
ren-.aJn for another week.
Anna Held's engagement at the Bald
win concludes with the Sunday night per
formance. Monday's new attraction is
"A Stranger in New York," the latest of
Hoyt's farces.
"Jane" retires from the Alcazar at the
end of the week in favor of "The Strange
Adventures of Miss Brown."
Morosco's actors are giving an unusual
ly good performance this week in "Hands
Across the Soa," a fine specimen of olil
type Adelphi melodrama.
"A Jay in New York" continues p.t the
California until Sunday, when Edward
Harrigran opons in his original success,
"Old Lavender."
Mandola, tho equilibrist, is the best of
the new turns at the Orpheum. and Mont
gomery and Stone, coon impersonators,
are the best of all, new or old.
Caniac's performing Jaguar and leopard
are one among many interesting animal
acts at the Chutes.

ARTICLE XIL
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
I City and County that its public utilities
i shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION L Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
I go into effect, and at least every two
' years thereafter until the object cx
i pressed in this provision shall have
: been fully attained, the Supervisors
i must procure through the City Engi
i neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
I works, steam, water or electric power
. works, telephone lines, street railroads
! and such other public utilities as tha
i Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
I of water works by the City and County,
j the Supervisors must procure and place
' on file plans and estimates of the cost
|of obtaining from all of the several
j available sources a sufficient and per
j manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
' interests of the City and County, enter
I into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
I and County, at a special election, prop
i ositlons for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
: lnal construction or condemnation, of
j public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the salo"
! to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible coat thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
| eented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, as
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
j the acquisition of such utility, it shall
; be the duty of the Board to immediate
i ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. Ths
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors &
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named In said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but In
case the votes cast in favor of both.propositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected.
Nothing in this section shall be bo
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same ai
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same in the manner herein
after provided.
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the City
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
upon such terms.
In case however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of, as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded Indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon, and whether such bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At
least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to bepaid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks In the official
nt-wspaper.
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting of
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
mination as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
â weeks after the electors by vote shall
have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. No question other
than the acquisition of such utility and
the Incurring of the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec. 8. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the proposed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City
and County shall issue for the payment
of the cost of the same, as in such or
dinance set forth (if the proposition be
accepted by the electors), and shall fix
a day on which such special election
shall be held, the manner of holding
such election, and the manner of voting
for or against incurring such Indebted
ness. Such election shall be held as
provided by law for holding elections
in the City and County.
Sec. 9. Such ordinance shall be pub
lished dally for at least ten days in the
official newspaper. At the expiration
of said ten days the Supervisors shall
cause to be published daily for not less
than two weeks in the official newspa
per a notice of such special election.
Such notice shall specify the purpose
for which the Indebtedness is to be in
curred, the number and character of
the bonds to be issued, the rate of in
terest to be paid, and the amount of
tax levy to be made for the payment
thereof.
Sec. 10. No indebtedness shall be in
curred for the acquisition of any public
utility under the provisions of this Ar
ticle, which, together with the existing
bonded indebtedness of the City and

of all real and personal property in the

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 6.â There Is a strong con
viction In Wall street that delay in the send
ing in of the President's message Is favorable
to the avoidance of war. This was clearly
manifested In the response of the market to the
early rumor from abroad that the President's
message would not go In to-day, and to the
later authorized announcement from Washing
ton that it would be withheld until Monday.
The disposition of the message was the cen
tral point about which the whole market turned
aJI day. The assortloiia of the newspapers this
morning that it would without question go in
to-day, ajid that it would declare for forcible
Intervention caused the decline at the open
ing opening prices In almost all cases being
the' lowest of the day. The resistance to the
decline and the quick recovery wcru a surprise
to outside observers, who wore prepared for
something like a panic on the exchange. The
recovery was due to cabled reports of a rumor
in London that the messne<- would not come
in until next Thursday. This rumor was
quickly discredited by statements from Wash
ington and the market drifted to a lower
i,li>ne again, but not to the lowest. The stag
nation of the trading during this period of
waiting was almost absolute and the sudden
outbreak of activity when the later authentic
reports came from Washington that the mes
<nKf would be delayed until Monday was In
strong contrast. It was evident that the con
tusion was leaped to that the withholding of
the message was due to a reception of further
proposals from Spain or to movemeuts for

mediation by European powers giving promise
that the countries might emerge peacefully
from their entanglement. The â¢â  violent ad- i
vance was checked and reaction set in when '
it was stated that the delay waa due to ad- I
vices from Consul-General Lee that he would j
not be able to secure the departure in safety i
of Americans from Cuba, before next Monday. j
Prices stiffened again, however, before the !
close on the strength of the general sentiment j
that delay favored peace. The money market i
maintained a waiting attitude. Time money ;
was firm at C per cent for all dates, but the |
exchange market showed a hardening tend
ency. Gold continues to come, however, from
abroad.

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK, April 6.â The -Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were waiting for President Mc-
Kinley's message to-day. The tone was awful
dull and feverish.
Americans opened fairly steady and then
Brave way on a sharp fall in Spanish 4Â«. The
latter subsequently rallied on Paris buying,
accompanied by reports that the Emperor of
Austria wan endeavoring to induce Spain to
come to terms.
Americans recovered with Spanish 4s, but In
the street became dull, notably consols) on
rumors that Â£75,000 in gold had been
ordered for New York from the Bank of
England to-morrow. New York sent tellinir
orders for Americans the first thing but at
the same time gave a lot of option money for
put and call later. New York also took stock
on balance.
Brazils were better on the rise in exchange
Gold to the amount of Â£155,000 was with
drawn from the Bank of England to-day for
New York, of which Â£100,000 was in sover
eigns. It is believed that this indicates
I an expectancy of. their probable return here
; soon.
The bank's selling price of eagles is 7Ga Bd.
but the buying price is probably 3 pence less!
Hence to bring- them back means considerable
; loss.
No withdrawal of Saturday's holiday has yet
: been announced. It is believed that nothing
but a war declaration will stop it. The city
opinion still favors a probable aversion of war
at the present time.
The prevalent rate for money here to-day Is
i2 7 per cent, contracts being made subject
however, to a possible rise in the Bank of
England's rate to-morrow.
The stock exchange will be closed Friday
Saturday and Monday.
Spanish 4s closed on the stock exchange at
48%, a net loss of % from yesterday's closing
price. _______ h

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April ."â  6.â The ; highest â  . prices
reached ; on yesterday's curb, .were quoted for ,
July wheat at the opening to-day, July start
ing all the way from hie to 86*4 c, against
Monday's closing price of 85*4<585%c.
For the first fifteen or twenty minutes' trad
ing- it was difficult to fill the short covering
orders which poured In from locai and outside
sources. Most of this was in small lots, but
St. Louis was a heavy buyer In covering im
portant short lines. The strength at the start
was apparently mostly due to the : foreign
news, Liverpool being about %d higher, ; while
Odessa reported Russian wheat advancing on
the wax prospects. Continental markets also
showed strength and London reported the Con
tinent as a buyer of fourteen of the seven
teen cargoes' off coast. The Northwest move
ment was rather light, Minneapolis and Du
luth reporting receipts of 253 cars, , compared
with 33S last week and 263 a year ago. Chi
cago receipts were 161 cars for two days.
Additions to contract stocks were more mod
erate, 56 cars from regular sources and 29 cars
from mixing houses, a total of about 55.000
bushels. â¢ The advance which marked the
opening soon brought large quantities of long
wheat onto the market, several Important lines
being offered by prominent professionals, and
after the more pressing wants of the shorts
had been satisfied, the market began to de
cline, slowly but surely. The recession move
ment continued for nearly two hours, during
which time July was hammered down to S4%e,
without any reaction of note. The firmness
of the closing Liverpool and Continental ca
bles and heavy purchases by commission
houses stopped the decline at that point and
caused a rally before noon to 85c, when an
other spell of weakness, due partially to I the
comparatively low prices paid for cargoes at
London, resulting in a drop to 84%@54%c. The |
decline was accompanied by a renewal of the I
Iniluentifl.l liquidation which marked the early I
weakness and the market up to within half j
an hour of the close showed considerable i
weakness News that the President's mes- j
sage would not be sent â¢â â  to Congress before |
Monday relieved the pressure toward the
close and a steadier feeling gradually mani
fested itself, liquidation dropping off to a great
extent Better support was given and the mar
ket recovered to 85V*c. The close was steady
a The action of corn was governed chiefly by
wheat Firm cables . were an early influence.
The market beoame very dull late In the day.
May ranged from 29;ic to 23V4C, and closed un
changed at 2'S**'-
Oats were fairly active In a general way,
with prices influenced mainly by the action
of wheat and corn. May ranged from 25 ' c to
25^c and closed steady at 25tt@25%c.
Provisions were irregular. Starting weak
and lower on account of lower hog prices, the
market quickly rallied on liberal purchases, but j
grew dull later in the session, the only in
fluence apparently being the drop in grain

LEES SAYS
THE CORONER
Death of Videl Cer
vantez Should Be
Investigated.
Detectives Now Waiting
for the Officers of the
Morgue.
Judge Coffey Dissatisfied With
the Bondsmen ot the
Administrator.
THE HUSBAND'S AVARICE.
TriÂ«Â» to Got Hold of the EstÂ»tÂ© Before
HiÂ« Bride's DÂ«Â»d Body Is
Cold.
The Coroner waited all yesterday for
some word from the Police Department
to begin Ar\ investigation into the
death of Mrs. Videl Cervantez, a Span
ish woman, who a week ago died un
der drcumstani es that her friends con-
Bider extremely suspicious. The wo
man was possessed of considerable
property and her body was hardly cold
when her husband of only a week be
gan to take possession of it all. The
body of the dead woman was rushed to
the grave and it was in the ground be
fore much more than twelve hours had
elapsed after death. No word, how
ever, reached the Coroner yesterday,
though three days before one of the
detectives detailed to investigate the
death of the woman had notified him
it would be necessary to have the body
of the woman exhunv?d and an analysis
of the stomach made to determine if
possible the presence of poison. The
Coroner, however, thought the police
would take some action to-day and no
tify him that there was reason to be
lieve a crime had been committed and
ask that the body be exhumed for the
purpose of an investigation.
Chief Lees last night said it was
clearly the province of the Coroner now ;
to take up the inquiry. '"It is his place
to act in such cases and not mine," !
Kaid the Chief. "The Call has given
him reason to believe that a crime has \
been committed and he should investi
gate it. I have do right to order him
to exhume the body. He should do that
un his own authority and if he should
find anything to warrant suspicions
that a crime has been done, then I shall
continue the Investigation."
The Probate Court took a hand in the
Investigation yesterday. The last clod
had hardly been turned on the newly
made grave of the dead wife wnen the j
husband applied for papers for ,-pecial
administration of the estate of the de
ceased. Upon his appointment, his
attorney, Alexander Campbell, procured j
two bondsmen, who qualified in the sum i
Of (2000 >;ic.h. They were accepted, but
when the Judge read the article in The
Call of yesterday, giving the reasons |
of the friends of the dead woman for
believing that the deceased had met
death foully he instituted inquiries re
garding the bondsmen. Both were be
fore the court yesterday. They were
Thomas King and Philip Reichert. The.
Judge had made Borne inquiries as to !
their property qualifications, and in re- 'â 
ply to questions Reichert said he had
property on Folsom worth $2000. lie
looked dazed when the court informed
him that his property was assessed for
only (1100 and that it was mortgaged !
for (1600. He admitted that it was tho
truth and In reply to further questions
lie said he was not a citizen of the
United States and that he was a: tho !
present time out of employment.
King gazed at tho floor in a stupid
manner, when the court told him that
his property on which he had qualified
as a bondsman was assessed at only
$7r>o, and he appeared very uneasy
when the court forced an admission â¢
from him that he had been paid $o for :
going on the bond.
It was shown to the court that the
dead woman had left property on
Pinckney alley that produced a revenue
of $10 a night, besides she had at the
time of her death $90G in coin and $500
worth of jewelry.
"I will set aside the former bond,"
Bald the Judge, "and raise the figure
to $6000. I will, however, not accept !
King and Reichert as bondsmen."
Detective Anthony has been working â 
on the case for several days, and he
cays the circumstances surrounding the j
death <>f the woman are at the least i
very suspicious. He is anxious to have
the body exhumed and an analysis of
the contents <>f the stomach made, as '
In his opinion poison was the means ;
used in producing her death.
Chief Lees yesterday declared h<*
knew nothing about the case and said
none of his detectives were working on ;
It as far as he knew. Some of the
Mends of the dead woman, however,
Btate that they have h*Â»ld consultations :
with the veteran Chief of Police In re
gard to the death of the woman on sev- j
eral occa.sions, and that the Chief Is \
well informed a.s to all the circum- !
stances surrounding the case.
Florentine Cervantez. the husband of
the dead woman, says that three
months ago he met his wife and on
MarÂ«-h 21 they were married by Judge'
Kerrigan. lie said: "I knew my wife \
was a sufferer from asthma. From the |
day of our marriage she suffered from
the disease until her death. On the day
before she died she asked me to get her i
some medicine. She said she wanted !
a patented articleâ a cherry prctoral. I
got the medicine for her. That was on
the night before she died."
It was not more than twelve hours
after the medicine was procured that '
the woman was dead. The bottle of,
pectoral had been emptied in that time. I
The medicine is known to contain large i
quantities of opium and the directions
that accompany the bottle caution the
users to be careful about overdosing, j
The maximum dose is given as fifty i
drops, but a woman who assisted in I
nursing the sl^k woman admits of hay- j
Ing administered as much as two nun- >
drf-d drops at one time. The opium ad- i
ministered in that way might have
caused death. The husband, however, :
claims that the woman was conscious :
Up to the time of her death and if that
ll so some other reason must be looked '
for.
Alexander Campbell Jr., who up to
yesterday was the attorney for Cer-
Kantes, .said:
"Cervantes has been my client since
the 21st of February. He was a part- !
ncr in the Pan Francisco Novelty Com- !
pany at 218 Montgomery avenue. Be- \
coming dissatisfied with the way the ;
b'uslness was being conducted became!
to me and I advised bringing suit lo
establish his rights. Within five days !
a satisfactory agreement wan conclud-
M between his partner and himself, by j
which he was to get one-fifth of the [
A BRIDE OF THE SEA.
Without a Mishap the St. Paul Slips From Land
Into Her Native Element.
THE St. Paul's was a most success
ful launching, so every one said, and
there was a good many people at the
Union Iron Works yesterday morning
to say it. She took her first plunge as
if she knew she was destined for the
sea, and although she hesitated a mo
ment before she started on her flying
trip down the greasy ways, once she
moved there was no trouble. She
slipped into the bay as easily and as
noiselessly as a gust of wind, and so
infatuated was she with her new
found liberty she went out to the end
of her checking line and snapping that
like a piece of cord she floated on to
ward the mud banks beyond until her
anchor was let go.
The launch was set for 11 o'clock, and
it came off promptly, but before that
time It was very evidont that some
thing was in the wind, for the slip
where she lay was full of busy work
men and the sound of heavy hammers
was on every side. Up to the last mo
ment she rested on heavy shores and
keel blocks, which In turn lay on the
solid foundation of the slip. F"or an,
hour before the launch the men were
knocking these away so as to let the
vessel settle down on the launching
cradle, and by the time set they had
all been moved but two big ones under
the bow. These were allowed to re
rcÂ»*iiptÃ. He did not visit my office
until the latter part of March, when he
complained that he was not being fair
ly treated under the prjjtnt arrange
ment, and wanted something done. Af
ter consulting with his partner it was
arranged that he was to receive $25 a
week for his services. Cervantes is one
i of the finest fancy leather workers in
the State and his services have always
! been in demand; that is why a settle
ment was so easily brought about.
"Two days Inter he called at my res
| Jdence on Greenwich street. I was at
! dinner and told him to return at 7 if he
I wanted to consult me. Promptly at
that hour he called again and told me
that he wanted to get married imme
, diately, and wanted to know whether
;it could be done that night. Cervantes
surprised me by telling me that his
i bride was to be Vidal Messa. I con
; gratulated him on winning the lady, be
; cause I knew of many who had tried
to win her regard, but failed. We got
the license and then went to Mrs.
: Messa'a rooms at 636 Vallejo street.
We found the bride to be in a frisky
| mood despite her age and condition.
I No one would ever have accused her of
! being handsome. She had been a suf

I seemed to be infatuated with her mi

' dressed as was fitting the occasion.
i Diamonds glittered from her lingers,

a remarkable appearance. The bride

the street for three bottles of cham

main so the ship would not take things
into her own hands too soon, and when
everything was ready these, too, were
knocked away and the dog shores
alone remained.
These peculiarly named devices are
what frees the ship so she can take to
the water, and it is only when these
are knocked away that she can start.
The lower ways are covered with
grease; the sliding ways rest on these
and the ship is cradled on the sliding
ways. Up near the bow there is a
heavy beam bolted to the side of the
sliding way, and a similar beam is
bolted to the lower way, both laid par
allel to the sliding surfaces and their
ends about three feet apart; between
these two ends a loose beam is placed,
and it is supported from falling by a
loose upright reaching up from one of
the blocks. The sliding way cannot
move until this loose beam falls, which
happens just as soon as the upright is
knocked away.
A platform had been built around the
bow of the St. Paul and at the hour of
launching the officers of the Alaska
Commercial Company, their friends
and little Miss Louise Bertha Sloss,
who was to do the christening,
took their places upon it. A man was
at each dog shore, a bottle of cham
pagne hung down from a blue ribbon
fixed at the bow, and everything was
ready. "All right," sung out Mr. Dickie,
the foreman.
There was a crash of axes as the dog
shores fell; the bottle at the bow
claims. We appeared before Judge
Coffey and upon his qualifying he was
.appointed to the office. The next day
we went to the safe deposit and I think
his jaw dropped many inches when he
viewed the contents of the safe. He cer
tainly expected to find many thousands
of dollars there, but was sadly disap
pointed to find only $906 in gold and
some jewelry worth about $500.
"Although Cervantes was worth soms
money I cannot imagine why he mar
ried Vidal unless it was for gain. ShÂ«
had none of those charms that would
lead a man to love her. In fact, sha
was repulsive. She was not reflne<l,
but was extremely ugly, and certainly
below his grade of intelligence.

popped and threw Its foaming con
tents over the vessel's side, and then
there was a silence which could almost
have been felt. She did not know she
was free, and the ship hesitated, but
not for long. Slowly she started as if
feeling her way, and then gathering
confidence she sprang forward into the
water, throwing a long curling wave
before her as she went, but without
making a sound; and it was only when
a bustling tug that could wait no
longer whistled shrilly that the spell
was broken. Then every one applaud
ed and some cheered as the breeze blew
out the ensign at the stern and the red
flag bearing the initials of the company
at the bow.
The St. Paul was built for the Alaska
Commercial Company and will be
placed on th" route between this port
and St. Michael, at which point s?ie
will connect with the fleet of stern
wheel steamers that run up the Yukon
to Dawson City.

She will have a speed of thirteen knots

She has accommodations for 257 cabin
and 300 second-class passengers.
Captain Hayes, late of the Bertha,
will be In command of her.
