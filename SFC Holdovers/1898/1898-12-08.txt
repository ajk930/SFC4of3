VOLUME LXXXV.- NO. 8.
MORGAN ASSAILS
THE NICARAGUAN
GOVERNMENT
Says It Violated Pledges in Let
ting a Canal praQcJjise to
Speculators.
Senate Committee Subnets a Report Upholding
tbe Maritime Company's
Rights.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.â As a
result of the meeting of the
Senate Committee on the Ni
caraguan canal to-day. Sena
tor Morgan gave notice of an
amendment of the Nicaragua canal
bill, authorizing the immediate is
suance, with a guarantee by this
Government, of $5,000,000 worth of
bonds for the redemption of all
obligations. He submitted at the same
time a report upon the situation with
reference to the canal, dealing exclu
sively with the fact that the Govern
ment of Nicaragua granted a conces
sion to construct a canal to a company
other than the M - itime Canal Com
pany.
Senator Morgan denounced this trans
action in severe terms, upholding the
rights of the Maritime Company for the
present and for an extension of its con
e. .^sion for ten years more. The report
arraigns the conduct of the republic of
Nicaragua as well as that of the
American citizens procuring the new
concession in most severe terms, at
tributing the course of Nicaragua to
jealousy of Costa Rica, and that of the
concessionaires to "obstruct a great na
tional policy in seiling out to a trans
continental railroad company for the
defeat of a supposed competitor."
"It would be well for the reputation of

KINGSTON, JAMAICA, VIEWED FROM THE HARBOR.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Dec. 7.â As part
of the scheme to convert Kingston
harbor into a great naval depot and
extensive dockyard, and in view of the con
struction of the Nicaraguan Canal in the
near future, the Admiralty authorities
have just completed negotiations for the
purchase of Greek Pond, at the western ex
treme of the city, where the proposed dock
yard will be constructed. It is said that the
work will be commenced immediately. The

those concerned." he says, "In thus dis
honoring governments for their per
sonal advantage and using their powers
to create jealousies between States, if
it should appear that their conduct is
not also corrupt."
The committee adduces aa a justifica
tion of the new report the seriousness
of the situation, saying on this point:
"The serious consequences likely to
result to the United State? from the un
precedented and. unwarranted action of
the late Government of Nicaragua, and
the evident purpose to force our Gov
ernment into payment of a large sum
as compensation for the future consent
of the republic of the United States of
Central America to the creation of a
maritime canal through the San Juan
River and Lak Nicaragua, require the
committee to present the grounds on
which it insists that this proceeding is
without any support in law, justice of
equity and that It violates the hitherto
cordial relations of the United States
with Nicaragua."
The report t -.kes issue with the con
tention of Nicaragua that th country
owns both banks of the San Juan River,
calling attention to the fact at Costa
Rica has equal rights, since f Â« arbitra
tion of President Cleveland, as the
owner of one bank of the stream. At
tention is called to the fact that In

making the concession of right of way
granted by Nicaragua, no mention was
made of Nicaragua's claim, rendering
It incumbent upon Nicaragua to put
the canal company into possession of
the channel of the river.
"Here," the committee Bays, "was a
breach of the agreement for which the
canal company had paid $150,000 and
that entitled th*> company to the return
of the money and to other damages.
It also imposed on the United States the
duty of compelling the redress due them
if redress had been sought."
It iÂ«* asserted V t in view of the fact
that Nicaragua had made the conces
sion it was her duty to obtain a conces
sion from the Costa Rica Government
when the claims of that country are
established, but instead of that it is
pointed out that Nicaragua made a
formal threat to renounce its concession
if any concession were obtained from
Costa Rica.
"Thus," the committee concludes, "by
conduct equivalent to mal force, Nica
ragua prevented progress in the work
on the canal and put a cloud upon the
credit of the company of execution that
could not be otherwise than disastrous."
The committee contends that the cir
cumstances of the concession point to
the fact tht the concession provides for
a charter to be granted to the United
States.
"In this attitude," the committee con
tinues, "the dutl s and responsibilities
of Nicaragua are very high if they do
not even rise to the dignity of solemn
pledges and consequent and sovereign
responsibilities, to the United States,
whose intervention is sought In the
chartering of the corporation."
It is then Bet forth that Costa Rica's
Interests in the canal are aa great as
those of Nicaragua, "and It follows that
the action of both republics is essential
to the assertion of the right of either
to claim a forfeiture of the concession.
If Nicaragua claims that the conces
sion it has granted is forfeited, Costa
Rica has the equal right to assert that
It is not forfeited."
It is then sts t forth that the United
States is a party to the measure of
building the canr' at the instance of
both Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and it
is claimed that the consent of this
country is necessary to any proceeding
on the part of Costa Rica looking to
the forfeiture of the concession.

"cannot repeal an act of Congress

dockyard, it is said, is to be the largest and
best equipped in the British dominions.
A naval authority who has been inter
viewed on the subject says the intention is
to make Jamaica another "Gibraltar to
command the canal and be a rallying point
for the naval and military forces of the
Anglo-American alliance, when, by domi
nating both oceans, it holds the political
and commercial balances of power in the
hollow of its hand."
HENRY T. GAGE
SCORES GRANT
OF SAN DIEGO
Plain Talk by the Gov
ernor-Elect.
ACCUSATION OF TREACHERY
BELIEVES THE STATE TICKET
WAS "KNIFED."
Senatorial Aspirant or His Intimate
Friends Traded Votes at the
Expense of Their
Party.
Spectat Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7. â Governor
Gage believes Ulysses S. Grant be
trayed the State ticket during: the re
cent campaign. Judging from the re
marks the Governor made to-day Mr.
Grant will find in Mr. Gage a foe who
does not know the meaning of the
word "compromise."
"L am not friendly to Grant." said
Mr. Gage to-day, "for I believe that he
or some of his intimate friends in San
Diego County acted the part of traitor
to the State ticket during the recent
campaign. A few days ago Mr. Grant
met me at the Palace Hotel and asked
me to state my position. I told him
that considering what had taken place
in San Diego County I did not think I
was under any obligation to him. If
Mr. Grant had reflected for one moment
he would not have interviewed me.
"I did not object to the editorial that
he published last summer in the Wave.
The editorial denounced me. but as It
was published before the State con
vention, its publication was to a cer
tain extent excusable. For the same
reason I did not object to the postal
card campaign that Mr. Grant con
ducted~throughout Southern California
After the convention, however, I ex
pected loyalty for the whole State
ticket.
"As far as the Senatorship is con
cerned, I am equally friendly to M. H.
de Young, John D. Spreckels, Dan
Burns, General Barnes, George Knight
and Mr. Bulla.
"The Governor does not appoint the
Senator, and I have troubles enough of
my own without seeking those that do
not concern me. I wish to say. how
ever, that I shall be unalterably op
posed to any candidate who is not jpen
ly and above board in favor of San
Pedro harbor. Every candidate will
have to proclaim himself in advance."
Although Governor Gage absolutely
refuses to say whether he leans to any
one of the foregoing candidates, some
of the best posted politicians in the
south say he is not averse to the can
didacy of Bulla. In the fight for the
gubernatorial nomination Bulla was
originally a rival of Gage. When Gage
won, however, Bulla took off his coat
and worked for the success of the Re
publican ticket. Gage is not unmind
ful of the generosity of his rival.
The Governor will leave Los Angeles
on Friday for a trip to his mine at Ac
ton. When he returns he will turn his
law business over to George Dennis,
formerly United States District Attor
ney. The Governor will then go north,
and until Christmas will divide his time
between San Francisco and Sacra
mento. He has not yet selected a resi
dence, and has not even thought of his
Inaugural address.
As far as patronage is concerned. Mr.
Gage has made only two selectionsâ
his private secretary and the executive
secretary. It Is understood that the
Governor will appoint Colonel Stone
adjutant general. As soon as he takes
office he will name a secretary to the
Board of Examiners. He has not yet
selected a man for the position.
A well-known actor who died Tuesday and
was quietly buried yesterday, and the
woman who was both wife and pupil.
ENGLAND WILL BE
ASKED TO CO-OPERATE
LONDON, Dec. B.â The Washington
correspondent of the Daily Chronicle
says: "I have ascertained from the
highest source that President McKinlcy
has no thought of ignoring or violating
British rights under the Clayton-Bul
wer treaty. On the contrary, when the
proper time arrives, England will be
invited to co-operate regarding the
Nicaraguan canal."
The Washington correspondent of the
Times mokes a similar statement.
The Daily Chronicle says, editorially:
"The assurance given by our Washing
ton correspondent cannot but cause
great satisfaction here. Yet there prob
ably will be some division of opinion in
England on the question of making the
canal with public money. There is no
reason why the work should not be
done by private enterprise under a gov
ernmental guarantee by both nations.
Our interest In the matter Is only that
the canal should be free, neutral and
open to all the world on equal terms."
The Madrid correspondent of the
Standard, who contrasts the indiffer
ence of the majority of Spaniards to
the President's message with the same
anxiety regarding his declarations fore
shadowing war, says:
"The press does not hide its satisfac
tion at the indications in the message
and elsewhere that American colonizing
will be fraught with difficulties and ex
penditures. The prediction is mude
that the Nicaraguan canal will lead to
troutfe between the United States and
Europe."
LIFE'S CURTAIN
RUNG DOWN ON
HEREWARD HOYTE
The Idol of Matinee Girls of Two
Continents Passes Away
in This City.
Widely Known Owing to His Marriage With Mrs.
Lucy Williams-Auzerais Three Years Ago
and His Meteoric Career Since.
Hereward Hoyte, the actor, Is dead.
With the name Lucy, that of his wife,
on his lips the man who in *'â Â» day was
the idol of the theater-goers of two con
tinents simply fell into the sleep which
knows no awakening in this world. The
curtain was rung down on a life that
had not entered upon its most serious
duties. The end was hastened by the
attempt of the brilliant young actor to
burn the candle at both ends.
Hoyte's career during the past three
years has been meteoric, not to say
tempestuous. Born in Australia thirty
five years ago, he first came to this
country in 1890 and at once assumed a
prominent place on the American stage,
playing leading Juvenile comedian roles
with Rose Coghlan and other stars. J
After appearing in all the big cities he
returned to the Colonies. He was a man
of splendid presence and with his nat
ural ability it was predicted that he
had a brilliant future before him. After
a fhort stay in Australia he again re
turned to this city, where he soon met
Lucy Williams-Auzerais. a woman of
great beauty and independent means.
She had both talent of a kind. and an
Inclination for the stage and the fates
sent them across each other's path,
whether for good or for evil let no un
kindly one say.
In a lttle vine-covered cottage on Oc
tavla street a brown-eyed, brown
haired widow mourns for the dead actor
whose passing away ends the one ro
mance of her ilte. The sorrow shown
by Mrs. Hoyte is too deep and too
poignant to be affected for the moment.
Dressed in somber black and with a
black bordered handkerchief to stem
the tide of tears that will not dry she
is a pathetic little figure of distress.
"He died with my name on his lips.
Oh, he was so good and so kind to me.
It seems hard for one like him to die.
He was only 35 and such a splendid
man. He was as big-hearted and kind
ly as any one could be and I idolized
him."
Her mood changed as her thoughts
reverted to his plans. "We were going
to act again and the future seemed so
bright for us. He had planned it all,
and now to think he is gone from me.
It was not my wish that the funeral
should be so quiet, but my friends
thought It best. He waa so well known

to all theatrical people that I felt In
my heart they should be allowed to
pay him some tribute.
"You won't speak harshly of a dead
man," she pleaded between sobs.
"Newspaper men have a wa^ of saying
sharp things, but there was so much
of goodness in my husband's life that
you can mention without seeking un
pleasant things that are not all truth.
He was always kind to me and I feel
alone In the world without him. The
end came all so suddenly that It is
hard for me to realize it. He should
have lived to a good old age, as hla
mother is 78 and his father died at; 82.
"He grew so stout recently that I
feared for his health. While In London
he had liver troubles from drinking,
perhaps a little too much, and his
physician denied him all strong drink.
He had cirrhosis of the liver. He did
not die of this, but of pulmonary con
gestion.
"I have hardly left his bedside for a
moment during the past fortnight.
Monday night he seemed to be improv
ing and was quite cheerful. After a
time he asked me for a drink of water
and repeated my name several times.
Finally he looked at me and, saying
'Lucy,', softly dropped off to sleep.
He did not awaken.
"My boy, who was devotedly attached,
to him, has not been told the news of his
stepfather's death. He is attending Dr.
Spalding's school and will be told so
that it will not shock him. He is such
a manly, honest-faced boy, and he
thought so much of poor Harry! Here
is his photograph. Isn't he a boy of
whom any mother could be proud?"
Tears, the solace of the afflicted in all
lands, then came to the relief of the
bereaved widow.
Out in St. Luke's Hospital an aged
woman whose once active brain has
been dulled by the years that have
passed over her head calls piteously for
her boy. This is Mrs. McDonald, moth
er of Hereward Hoyte McDonald, who
was buried yesterday in Masonic Ceme
tery. Mrs. McDonald's condition is so
I serious that her physician dreads the
j result when she is told her youngest
j son, always her pride, is dead. He
I brought her proudly from Australia
and installed her in his home here.
j There came a time when she required
\ the continuous attention of trained
nurses and then her son and his wife
! provided for her at St. Luke's, where
| all that modern science can do for her
lis applied to lessening her sufferings
I for the short time left her on earth.
The romance which was ended by
death on Tuesday had its origin some
three years since. Mrs. Auzerais had
just divorced her husband, whom she
found caused too heavy a drain upon
j even her splendid income. The craving
j for the stage was strong within her at
i the time, and she placed herself under
; Mr. Hoyte's tuition preparatory tomak
i ing her debut as an amateur. This
event, which was one of the great func
tions of 1895, was a most impressive
affair at the Palace Hotel. Admission
was by invitation, and the maple room
never held a more brilliant gathering.
Mrs. Auzerais' gowns were marvelous
creations of the modiste's art and cast
; into the background any ever worn on
the local stage before. At the time her
i greatest talent was in the wearing of
j these gowns gracefully, as though to
! the manner born, her acting being ama
teurish.
The apparent success of her debut
made her stage mad, and she at once
organized a company for the road.
Here the troubles, which have beset her
path, commenced. The tour proved a
Junketing trip. The company went
north into inhospitable Alaska, and the
traveling expenses made heavy inroads
upon Mrs. Auzerais' purse. However,
it had Its compensations, as the leading2
lady went away an amateur and re
turned a professional.
While the company of which Mr.
Hoyte wae a member was in the north,
Hpyte'a wife obtained a divorce from
him. Shortly after he wedded Mrs.
Auzerais. He had been her devoted
teacher for some time, and the mar
riage caused but little surprise among
their intimates. The coaching went on
withoUt interruption, and then came
Ikt first appearance on a metropolitan
stage. With her husband she ap
peared with her own company at the
Alcaiar Theater, April 20. 18%. For a
â¢urtain-raieer there was a tidbit, "The
Betting of the Sun," and also a comedy,
"Everybody's Friend."
Both productions were kindly re
ceived by the critics, but financial
trouble soon showed the manager
actress that her path was not to be be
strew n with roses. Bills for printing
and music and for .the gorgeous gowns
worn by her were presented, and, re
maining unpaid, suits were brought to
compel settlement. The expectations of
great histrionic and financial success
were dissipated in thin air.
It's an did adage "Troubles never
come singly." With the failure of her
theatrical venture came a whisper of
a rift within the lute as to her home
life. There was a story of a stormy in
terview between husband and wife and
of her seeking protection from friends.
All parties denied that any such thing
happened, and husband and wife have
to all outward appearances lived hap
3'tly together until death put them
apart.
After the disastrous experiment a
the Alcazar they left the stage and
neither of them have appeared before
the footlights since. They rented Crit
tenden Thornton's mansion on Pacific
avenue and settled down to a Bohemian
existence. As the outcome of this they
were mulcted in the sum of $500 for
damage done the walls, carpets and
uther furnishings of the lawyer's home
The restless young couple then de
cided upon a European trip and spent
nearly two years on the Continent. I
seemed impossible for them to keep out
of the public eye and they were soon
objects of international correspondence
While at Cannes, France, they were
imprisoned fur debt, as is the custom in
that country. They cabled Governor
Budd and also Secretary Olney at
Washington urging them to have Mrs
Hoyte's financial agent to remit $1000
The unhappy couple safely weathered
this storm and left inhospitable France
Â«s- soon as possible. Since then the>

last March and returned to this city
a month ago.

APPOINTMENT
OF SENATORS
Hoar Speaks About
Commissions.
OTHERS DIFFER FROM HIM
MORGAN AND PL ATT THINK THE
PRESIDENT'S PLAN BIGHT.
After Two and a Half Hours of De
bate the Question Is Referred
to the Judiciary Commit
tee to Investigate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.â No business
was transacted by the Senate to-day in
open session. A few minutes after the
Senate convened it went into executive
; session. At 2:15 o'clock business in open
session was resumed, the death of Rep
resentatives Northway of Ohio and
Love of Mississippi was announced and
; the Senate adjourned as a mark of
respect to their memories.
At the opening of the Senate's session
j Hawley of Connecticut, chairman of the
Military Affairs Committee, introduced a
i bill for the reorganization of the regular
; army.
At 12:16 p. m., on motion of Lodge, the
i Senate went into executive session.
A long debate was had in executive
,; session upon the subject of the confirma
i tion of the Hawaiian Commissioners.
! The debate was started by Senator
| Hoar, who made a vigorous protest
| against the practice of appointing Sena
j tors upon such a commission. Fie said
the Senators, when appointed, acted
under the direction and became the
duly authorized agents of the President
to carry out his ideas and wishes. What
became of their functions as Senators,
i he asked, when the report they make,
as in the case of the Hawaiian Com
: mission, came before the Senate, a co-
I ordinate branch of the Government?
In the case of the Joint High Commis
sion, now negotiating a treaty with
Great Britain, and the Peace Com- I
mission, now in Paris, there were the i
same objections, but they applied with j
greater force. Senators should hold j
aloof from such positions because their
| acts as Commissioners were to be passed !
j upon by themselves as Senatorsâ a very
| reprehensible practice, in the opinion o*f I
Hoar. He intimated that Senators act- â 
I ing for the President as a commission i
which, in dealing with a foreign country, 'â¢
; had to act as a body, might be placed 1
j in the position of supporting a cause i
i which they as Senators would reject.
The method of appointing Senators on !
commissions was defended by Senator
Morgan and Senator Platt of Connecticut.
Other speakers in the controversy
! were Senators Chandler and Bacon,
1 who were in opposition to the free exer
j cisc by the President of the power to
appoint Senators to other positions.
j Senator Aldrich made the point that ;
! the position of the commissioners in 'â 
i such duties as those of the Hawaiian >
| Commission and the Paris Peace Com- !
! mission was not inconsistent with the i
I performance of Senatorial duties. These !
j positions were, he said, not offices in the i
I usual interpretation of the word, and to i
' prevent the Presidents calling for their |
I service for such work was often to de- i
i prive him of the best assistance avail- |
j able in special cases like those in which j
I Senators Morgan. Cullom, Davis, Frye I
! and others were engaged.
After two and a half hours of discus- I
i sion the question was referred to the
Judiciary Committee with instructions to '
investigate and report upon the nomina- i
tion of the commissioners.
At 2:15 p. m. the Senate resumed busi
ness in open session. Communications
were received from the House of Repre
sentatives announcing the death during
the recess of Representative Stephen A.
Northway of Ohio and Representative
William F. Love of Mississippi. On mo
tion of Foraker of Ohio, as a mark of re
spect to the memory of the deceased the
Senate at 2:20 p. m. adjourned.
HOUSE PASSES THE
ANTI-SCALPING BILL
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.â The House to
day, passed the anti-ticket scalping bill
by a vote of 119 to 101. This action is the
culmination of a ten-year struggle on the
I>art of the railroads to put an end to the
business of ticket scalping:. The Inter
state Commerce Commission first called
attention to the subject In Its report of
1888, and it has been before Congress ever
since, in one form or another. During the
last session extensive hearings were given
both to the representatives of the rail
roads and the scalpers, and Sherman of
New York secured 174 pledges for the
measure. It was, however, deemed inad
visable to bring the matter forward until
the present session. The debate to-day
lasted four hours, and was spirited upon
both sides. None of the amendments of
fered were .adopted, and the bill was
passed as reported by the committee.
.The bill requires the carriers subject to
the interstate commerce act to provide
each agent authorized to sell tickets with
a certificate, and makes it unlawful for
an officer of such carrier to supply tick
ets to any but authorized agents. It
malces violations of these provisions a
misdemeanor, and provides for the re
demption of unused or partially used
tickets and also provides penalties for
forging or altering tickets. Mr. Sherman
said this legislation had been repeatedly
recommended by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, that it had the support of
newspapers and commercial bodies and
that over 3000 petitions in its favor had
been presented to the House during the
present Congress. The business commu
nities had come to look upon ticket brok
erage business as illegal. The amount of
fraud practiced, if known, would startle
any one familiar with the facts.
VICTORY CELEBRATED.
First Annual Meeting of Santa
Good Government League.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 7.â The first annual
meeting of the Republican Good Govern
ment League was held at Rutherford Hall
yesterday afternoon. It was a large and
enthusiastic gathering and was in the

TO INCREASE OUR
SHIPPING TRADE
Merchant Marine Needs
Enlarging.
SEVERAL PLANS SUGGESTED
COMMISSIONER CHAMBERLAIN'S
REPORT.
Advocates Extending Direct Govern
ment Aid to Vessels Built
in the United
{States.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.â The annual
report of Navigation Commissioner
Chamberlain is devoted mainly to sta
! tistics and facts in support of the
1 project for the creation of the American
; merchant marine, recommended by
j Secretary Gage. Following are ex-
tracts:
Excluding the great lakes, practically
shut off by Niagara Falls from foreign
competition, the tonnage of vessels en
tered and cleared at seaports of the
United States in foreign trade for 1897
comprised 7,248,625 tons American and
32,632,419 tons foreign shipping. In over
sea navigation to foreign ports more than
1500 miles distant. American shipping
amounted to only 2.065.656 tans, compared
with 27,418,026 tons foreign.
Only three practical courses, at the
present time, are open to the United
States:
Firstâ We may retain our laws un
changed, ignore national navigation and
continue to rely on vessels under foreign
flags for the transportation o- our ex
ports and imports.
Secondâ We may permit foreign-built
vessels to register under the American
flag, ship crews abroad and increase na
tional navigation.
Thirdâ We may extend direct Gov
ernment aid to vessels built in the United
States and thus increase both national
navigation and national ship-building.
-The last named of these three courses
re suggested to a very great extent by
our new relations to the rest of the
world, which expects the United States
to become a maritime power. For the
first time we now hold and shall doubt
less permanently hold inhabited terri
tory beyond the limit of the North
American continent.
Largely through indifference we have
lost the share in trans-Atlantic naviga
tion which was once ours. The grow
ing trade of the Pacific is rabidly slip
ping away from us. Excluding Hawaii,
entries and clearances from Asia and
Oceanlca at ports of the United States
during 1890 amounted to 235.950 tons Amer
ican shipping, and in I^7 to only 221 .438
tons, while foreign shipping increased
from 431,242 tons to 924,720 tons.
Foreign nations are skillfully following
the policy of government aid to develop
their navigation in the Pacific. Toward
steamship lines to the east coast of Asia
alone Great Britain last year contribu
ted $1,250.0*10: France. $1,217,000.: Germa
ny. $480,000; Spain (1596). $416,000; Russia,
$406,000; Austria. $306,000, and Italy. $277.
000. The United States paid only $40,000 to
American lines to Asia at regular mall
rates. We have deluded ourselves into
the belief that the Pacific trade will be
come ours without taking ordinary pre
cautions to meet competition.
We must take steps for the qualified ad
mission of foreign ships to American reg
ister in order to enter immediately into
active competition for Asiatic trade.
It will require at least eighteen months
to build the vessels of over 5000 tons and
sixteen knots, now needed to meet new
conditions in the Pacific.
A relaxation of the registry law was
necessary to establish our trans-Atlantic
line, and a similar relaxation is now nec
essary to meet conditions on the Pacific.
The restriction of trade between the
United States and Hawaii to American
vessels is even more important. Of that
trade 30 per cent is already carried on by
American vessels and over 10 per cent of
the remainder by Hawaiian vessels which
will doubtless be admitted to American
registry by Congress. American vessels
now leaving in ballast are sufficient to
supply the transportation requirements of
the islands if foreign vessels are with
drawn. Almost the entire value of the
annexation of Hawaii to the development
of American navigation in the Pacific is
involved in treating the islands as an ex
tension of our boundaries, bringing us
from IJOO to 2000 miles nearer the markets
of Asia and Australia. The opposition of
British and German interests to the prop
osition is anticipated in the line of their
consistent policy of subsidies to develop
their shipping on the Pacific. The re
strictions proposed, however, are in strict
accord with our national policy and with
our treaties and do not interfere with
the existing trade relations.
A revision of the tonnage tax laws is
proposed and the report also considers
legislation for the improvement of
American seamen, pilotage charges,
seaworthiness of vessels, allotment of
wages and other matters.

UNION OF HEBREW
CONGREGATIONS
Interesting Report on the
Zionistic Movement.
NOT POLITICAL ORGANIZATION
JEWS A RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY,
NOT A NATION.
"America Is Our. Zion, and Washing
ton Our Jerusalem," the Senti
ment Expressed at the
. Convention.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
RICHMOND, Va., Dec. 7.â The union
of Hebrew congregations, in convention
here, devoted the time of to-day's ses
sion to consideration of reports of the
committees on the Hebrew Union Col
lege and the Zionistic movement. The
former committee, after recognizing the
labors of the board of governors of the
college and of Dr. Wise and his asso
ciates of the faculty, and making an
appeal for more financial support for
the institution, recommended that the
age of admission to the college be raised
to sixteen years and also announced
that the college cannot undertake to
pay for the secular instruction at the
high school and university.
The first recommendation -was re
ferred to the boar"d of governors. The
second recommendation was amended
so as to say simply "secular instruc
tion," leaving out the names of the
schools. The report, as a whole, was
then adopted.
The report on the Zionistic move
ment was submitted as follows:
The union of American Hebrew Congre
gations in convention assembled, in view
of the active propaganda being made at
present for the so-called Zionistic move
ment, deems it proper and necessary to
put itself on record as follows:
We are unalterably opposed to political
Zionism. The Jews are not a nation, but
a religious community. Zion was a pre
cious possession of the pastâ the early
home of our faithâ where our prophets ut
tered their world-subduing thoughts and
our psalmists sang their world-enchanting
hymns. As such, it is a holy memory
but it is not a hope of the future.
America is our Zion, and Washington
our Jerusalem. Here, In the home of re
ligious liberty, we have aided In founding
this new Zion, the fruition of the begin
ning laid in the old. The mission of Juda
ism is spiritual, not political. Its aim is
not to create a state, but to spread the
truth of religion and humanity throughout
the world.
The report precipitated a heated dis
cussion, in which nearly all the dele
gates took part. Finally Dr. David
Philipson said that the report had
aroused so much interest and so many
requests had been made that the com
mittee had determined to make the fol
lowing addition and change:
"While we are aware of and deplore
the abject condition to which many of
our brethren are subjected in foreign
lands, and that have naturally but un
fortunately aroused in some of them a
yearning for a re-establishment of Zion,
yet we delegates of the Union," etc.
Then follows the original resolution
w r ith the words, "and Washington, our
Jerusalem," stricken out.
The report was further discussed and
then adopted.
The report of the committee on ac
counts showed that at present ninety
one congregations constitute the Union.
RETRENCHMENT POLICY
WAS SHORT-LIVED
San Jose's Board of Education Get-
ting Back Into the Same
Old But.
SAN JOSE. Dec. 7.â The streak of econ
omy which possessed the City Board of
Education a week ago is proving a sham.
Last night the board elected Misses Fan
nie Stockton and Kate Curley teachers for
the grammar schools. Five teachers were
re-employed a few days ago. making an
addition of seven since the trustees mas
queraded as economists. It is understood
petitions asking that the kindergarten be
opened and the teachers put back in their
places are being circulated at the instance
of the trustees.
The re-election of Miss Fannie Stockton
is due, it Is reported, to an ante-election
pledge. Last June the Classification Com
mittee, consisting of Trustees Graham
and Kenyon. reported on her dismissal be
cause she refused to use her influence for
"Boss" Rea's ticket. She threatened to
bring suit to test the right of the Trustees
to discharge her without cause, and these
Trustees promised her that if she did
not bring suit and kept quiet until after
election she would be reinstated. She
was also promised that her salary,
amounting to $234 for the months she was
out of school, would be given her.
Last night Miss Stockton was re-elect
ed, but the bill for her salary was laid on
the table.. In all probability she will
bring suit for the money.

INCREASES THE
REGULAR ARMY
The Bill Introduced by
Mr. Hull.,
MILES' PLANS ARE IGNORED
ENLISTING TROOPS IN NEW
POSSESSIONS.
Miles Wanted a General and Two
Lieutenant Generals, but the
Measure Provides for Only-
One Lieutenant General.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.âRepresenta
tive Hull, chairman of the House Com
mittee on Military Affairs, to-day in
troduced a bill increasing the regular
army to approximately 100,000 men. The
bill was framed at the "War Depart
ment and has the approval of the Sec
retary of War. It is not the bill
framed by General Miles, as this meas
ure has not the high rank proposed by
the Miles bill, and some of the appoint
ments are open to officers of the volun
teers from civil life. It provides for a
lieutenant general, and what is con
sidered a sufficient increase of major
generals and brigadier generals to com
mand an army of 100,000 men, scattered
from Porto Rico to Manila. The artil
lery arm is reorganized, separating it
into coast and field artillery, but pro-,
motion to be by seniority of the whole
arm. A decrease of the enlisted men is
made, so that the army can be increas
ed by recruits in case of war to full
strength. The cavalry is increased
two regiments, the infantry five. The
enlisted strength of an infantry com
pany is not to exceed 145, so that in
case of war new regiments would have
to be formed, probably all of which
would be volunteer, but the regular
army would make a substantial first
line. The bill provides for the three
battalion formation.
The staff corps are increased about 40
per cent, and with the exception of the
adjutant general, inspector general and
ordnance, are open to appointments
from the volunteers or civil life. The
most noticeable change is in that of the
medical department, in which provision
is made for a hospital corps of 3000 pri
vates, with the necessary non-commis
sioned officers, with a largely increased
number of surgeons and assistant sur
geons. All officers and men serving in
the sub-tropical countries are to have
an increase of 25 per cent in pay. Un
der the immediate control of the Presi
dent, inhabitants of the new countries
may be enlisted in the organizations
there serving.
The bill gives a total of fourteen regi
ments of artillery, twelve of cavalry
and thirty of infantry.
Chairman Hull's bill is cast on entire
ly different lines from General Miles'
bill, so that detailed comparison is dif
ficult. The Miles bill is based on the
theory of one soldier for one thousand
population, while the Hull bill is based
on the idea of a total force of 100,000,
the organization being constructed so
as to reach that total. General Miles
provides for a general and for two
lieutenant generals, while the Hull bill
makes no provision for a general, and
has but one lieutenant general. Other
important differences are:
Hull bill, thirty regiments of in
fantry; Miles bill, fifty regiments of in
fantry.
Hull bill, twelve regiments of cavalry;
Miles bill, fifteeen regiments of cavalry.
Hull bill, a cor^s of artillery; Miles
bill, fourteen regiments of seacoast
artillery and two regiments of field
The Hull bill in its first section sums
up for the reorganized army as follows:
One lieutenant general, six major
generals, twelve brigadier generals,
twelve regiments of cavalry, a corps of
artillery, thirty regiments of infantry,
an adjutant general's departm nt, an
inspector general's department. a
judge advocate general's department, a
quartermaster's department, a sub
sistence department, a medical depart
ment, pay department, a corps of en
gineers, an ordnance department, a
signal corps, thirty post chaplains, the
chief of the record and pension office,
the officers of the army on the retired
list, the professors, corps of cadets, an
army service detachment and band at
the United States Military Academy
and such other officers and enlisted
men as may hereinafter be provided for.
The regimental organization of the
artillery arm is discontinued and that
member is designated as the corps of
artillery. The distinction between
coast and field artillery is similar to
the Miles bill, but more elaborate in
, detail. The Atlantic division of the
! coast is defined to include the
Atlantic and the Gulf seaboards and the
coast of the great lakes, "and shall
ultimately include the -oast line of the
j West Indian possessions of the United
I States."
The Pacific division is defined to in
clude the Pacific seaboard "and shall
ultimately Include the coast line of the

are to be open to the public and some interesting athletic events are
promised.
Anderson Island precinct has six candidates tied for Justice and
six for Constable, all having an equal number of votes.
various possessions of the United
States in the Pacific Ocean."
The corps of artillery embraces 144
batteries of coast artillery and twenty
four field batteries.
Each regiment of infantry consists
of twelve companies, organized into
three battalions of four companies each.
The company strength, in addition to
commissioned and non-commissioned
officers, is 112 men. In various staff
corps express provision is made that
persons who have served as officers in
the volunteer army in the war with
Spain and persons in civil life may be
appointed to various specified grades.
Section 16 is as follows: "Organiza
tions serving in Cuba, Porto Rico and
the islands of the Pacific may, in the
discretion of the President, be re
cruited in whole or in part from the in
habitants thereof, to whom the legal
restrictions upon enlistments in the
army as regards terms of service, age,
citizenship and educational qualifica
tions shall not apply, and who shall be
entitled to such pay and allowances, not
exceeding those now authorized, as the
President may direct."

NARROW ESCAPE FROM
DEATH IN FLAMES
Santa Cruz Rancher's Wife Slides
Down a Post From the Roof of
a Burning Building.
SANTA CRUZ. Dec. 7.â F. R. Dann's
re?i 1 ice at the Mountain View farm
near this city was destroyed by fire last
night. Mrs. Dann went to her room to
save her jewelry and when she started
down stairs, found the way blocked by
flames, so she climbed to the roof and
slid down a post, with fire trailing so
closely behind her that her hair was sing
ed.
With much difficulty several cottages
and an amusement hall were saved. The
loss is about $5000, with insurance of
$2700. The fire was caused, presumably,
by hot ashes which had been left in a
grate.

STEWART COMPLAINS
OF F. G. NEWLANDS
â  But Political Sharps Think There Is
a Secret Understanding Between
the Sagebrush Statesmen.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.â Senator Stew
art of Nevada evidently realizes he will
be defeated for re-election, for in an in
terview to-night, prepared by himself, he
complains bitterly that Congressman
Francis G. Newlands gave him his word
that he would not be a candidate for the
Senate.
In Washington, where both gentlemen
are well known, it is, to say the least,
considered strange that there should be
any political differences between them.
They have for several years been asso
ciated in real eÃtate transactions together
and were supposed to be close friends. It
is suspected by some of the political
sharps that there is some secret deal be
tween them and that the apparent mis
understanding is for political effect. It
is believed here 'that in case Stewart fails
Newlands will be his political legatee.

Valuables Are

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7.â The ware
house of the Standard Oil Company and
nine tanks of oil were destroyed this
afternoon by fire. The nine tanks were
Bmail sized. Four of them contained
gasoline, one benzine and four linseed
oil. Fortunately four l:\rge tanks con
taining hundreds of thousands <Jf gallons
of Oil <li<3 not burst. If the flames had
reached the oil in these tanks?, one of
which contained gasoline, the fire would
have one of the most disastrous this
city has ever known. Although E. S.
Sullivan, the local manager, places the
damage at only $25,000, experts say that
$100,000 will not cover the loss. Little
or no insurance was carried.
Shortly after 3 o'clock this afternoon
J. Peterson, an employe of the Stand
il Company, was assisting a ped
i named Stevens to fill his wagon
tank with benzine. Peterson was hand
ing the benzine to Stevens, who was
in the v on. Suddenly Peterson heard
a noise and saw that the bucket, into
which be was pouring the oil from the
faucet, was on fire. Peterson tried to
quench t..-> flames, but they spread
quickly to the benzine tank, which con
tained' 7000 gallons of oil. Stevens
whipped up his horse and tried to es
from the names, but as he left
tli" yard it was noticed that his wagon
was ablaze. The lire was probably due
to the i arelessness of Stevens, who had
either lighted a match or had mis
i a pipe.
Manager Sullivan saw the burning
wagon, realized the danger to the ware
and rushed to close the fireproof
After turning in an alarm he
his attaches did their utmost to
:â¢ the books ai.d valuables. The
fire spread so rapidly that only a por
tion was saved before the flames
reached th<- warehouse.
The benzine tank had been burning
for fully fifteen minutes. As soon as
the names beran to lick up that build
ing there was a series of explosions
which caused the flames to spread
quickly all around the warehouse. The
smaller tanks began to melt away and
the thousands of people that had been
attracted by the fire were driven back
by fear of an explosion of the gasoline
tank.
At first the flames shot brightly from
>n the top of the tanks. Then
â  < <1 the dull, heavy black cloud of
the oil fire. At a distance the sky
s- emed to be darkened. On coming
nearer, however, curving flames could
be seen. Beneath the dark cloud over-
head a series of fire areas seemed to
a â form and tn trace spiral curves.
The warehouse was Bituated on the
rfver bank between the Downey avenue
Buena Vista street bridges, and
between the Santa Fe and South
ern Pacific tracks. The Santa Fo runs
in a northeasterly direction; the South
ern Pacific runs north and south.
Seven Santa Fe cars w*Â»re burned.
Four cars were laden with hay, one
box car contained coal, two tank cars
contained crude oil. The Soutnern Pa
cific lost no cars.
Later the flames reached the four bie
tanks, which fortunately did not burst.
The largest tank holds 400,000 gallons,
hut had only 125,000 gallons in it to
day. The second t;mk holds 200.000 sal
lons of oil. but to-day it hold only 40.
000 gallons of gasoline. Had the flames
reached the gasoline the loss to life and
property would have been awful. The
remaining two tanks which hold 100.000
gallons each, are practically intact.
At 4:16 o'clock the fire was fairly well
tinder control, but somo of the firemen
â will be left at work all night. No dam
age was done to the cottag-es in the
neighborhood.

TOLD BY CAPTAIN WHITING
WONDERFUL ENDURANCE OF
THE CREW IN THE TROPICS.
Successful Voyage on a Monitor, Lit
tle Better Than a Raft, From
San Francisco to
1 Manila. i
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.â The Navy
'â  Department has just made public a re
! port from Captain Whitiner. who com
j manded the Monadnock on the voyage
| from San Francisco to Manila, in
1 which, after tellinV of some of the
; hardships endured during the trip, pays
i a well deserved compliment to the ener
\ gy and ability of the officers and crew
! which made possible what was without
, doubt the most remarkable voyage ever
; made by an ironclad vessel In an emer
j gency.
Captain Whiting's report. which
; reached the Navy Department through
Admiral Dewey, contains the follow
ing:
U. S. S. MONADNOCK, SECOND RATE.
MARIVEL.ES. P. 1., Oct. 22, 189 S.
Sir: Notwithstanding the fortuitous
consequence to myself attendant upon
the cruise of this vessel to the
relief of the Asiatic fleet at Ma
nila, I should consider myself as
derelict to my duty as commanding offi
cer, now that the war is over, if I failed
to call the attention of yourself and the
department to the highly neritorious
services rendered by this ship's com
pany of officers and men under the most
trying and difficult circumstances.
The ability, couraee. zeal and endurance I
shown by them in crossing the Pacific
Ocean in a vessel of this typo, practically
a raft with only sixteen inches freeboard
in her overloaded condition, certainly de- I
serves some recognition. A cruise of
over 7000 miles in the tropics, in the ex
cesstve temperatures, with what small i
deck room there is in the ship packed I
with coal, so that sleeping places and ;
sleep were almost unattainable luxuries
for the forty days spent at seaâ all hands â¢
upon a limited amount of fresh water, ,
struggling with appurtenances and en- !
glnes never designed for such overloaded
service, continually breaking down and as
continually being repaired, no war duty
has been more onerous or more disheart->
oning.
Anticipating a fight to the death with !
the enemy's heaviest force, afloat, the voy- '
ape has been for all a forlorn hope from i
the beginning, recognized as such by all ;
who participated, heartily joined in with
out flinching, happily ending without an
incident, yet only needing disaster to em
phasize what I write.
Continuing, Captain Whiting es- !
pecially commends the alertness of the :
,' Monadnock's executive officer. Lieu- ;
! tenant Commander C. P. Perkins; Chief :
; Engineer T. F. Burgdorff, who "stub- j
bornly fought the inherent weakness of i
engines designed for harbor use and j
successfully forced them through such '
! a prolonged voyage at sea," and Sur- i
; geon J. M. Steele. who carried the j
i ship's company through the trying or- !
i deal without a single fatality, though
j men were continually falling from heat I
1 and exhaustion.
Speaking of the zealous responses ol j
\ the officers and men to unusual calls :
fnr duty, Captain Whiting says:
They volunteered by delegation to coal '
ship by day and night at Guapn, although
i nearly prostrated by the heajrand confino
ment to which they were subjected, both
there and while en route. Too much i
j praise cannot be given the engineer's !
j force below, who were incessantly occu- '
'â  pied at all times, day and night, under the
' most arduous circumstances that can be ;
, imagined on board ship in the tropics, do- j
ing their utmost to keep the machinery in i
< running order.
That I have succeeded in safely bringing !
: this monitor so far from her intended field !
j of action in such a comparatively short ]
: time, with the Nero for a consort, is !
wholly and entirely due to the mast patri
otic and energetic support of this ship's 'â 
company of officers and men. There is
no better ship's company afloat and all
who can show upon their records that j
they took part in the cruise of the
Monadnock from San Francisco to Manila
during the war with Spain deserve all the !
; favors that the Navy Department and a I
grateful country can bestow upon them j
either now or in the future
NORTHERN PACIFIC
FXECUTES A COUP
Beats the Oregon Line Into Lewiston
by Laying a Track at
Night.
TACOMA, Dec. ".âAt Lewiston, Idaho,
yesterday the Northern Pacific beat the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
pany at the latter's own game. The Ore
| gon Railway and Navigation Company
had been piling up material for a week,
; but did little construction work. Yester
day morning Lewiston found that the
Northern Pacific had landed men ties
and rails during the night and was rap
idly laying track around the city's water
front.
Thfcs coup gives the Northern Pacific
; possession of the best part of the frontage
on both Snako anu Clearwater rivers and
puts the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company at a disadvantage in securing
adequate terminals. To get into Lewision
; the Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
, pany will have to build up the north side
of Clearwater River, cross it below the
Northern Pacific bridge and then build
back on the opposite shore into town.
MANY RELIGIOUS MANIACS.
Four Followers of "The Wife of
Christ" Now in the Insane
Asylum.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 7.-The State Lu
nacy Commission has on flle papers to
show that within the past few days there
have been four commitments from South
ern California. In each of these cases
the cause of insanity is given as religion
and each of the patients is known to have
been a disciple of an alleged "healer"
who is known by her followers as Mum
my Williams.
This aged colored woman claims to be
the wife of Christ and has created a
great deal of excitement among the ne
frces in the southern part of California
t Js reported that one of her disciples
starved himself to death.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1898.
ACCUSED OF HAVING
ACCEPTED A BRIBE
Supervisor Charles W. Garrett of Fresno
County Indicted by a Grand
Jury.
FRESNO, Dec. 7.â Supervisor Charles W. Garrett was Indicted by the
Grand Jury this morning on a charge of having received a bribe of
$150 in connection with the purchase last August of a road sprinkler
at a cost of $900. The true bill returned by the Grand Jury was present
ed to Judge Rlsley at 10 o'clock. Then the jury returned to make fur
ther Investigation into the same affair. At 4 o'clock a bench warrant was
Issued on the indictment and placed In the hands of Deputy Sheriff Peck,
who served it on the Supervisor shortly after the board had adjourned.
Garrett was not taken by surprise; in fact, he had been informed that
he had been indicted and was looking after bondsmen. His bond was fixed
in the sum of $5000 by Judge Risley and he gave bail with Jeff Ames, Adolph
Shields, John Kerr and Frank "Wickersham as sureties.
According to the findings of the Grand Jury, Garrett received $150 as a
bribe to vote for a road sprinkler for his district, which was bought for
$900. It was purchased from the Hopkins Agricultural Works, of which
James K. Hopkins is president.
Garrett was summoned before the Grand Jury and admitted having re
ceived $150 from Hopkins about a week after the purchase of the sprinkler,
but claimed that he merely borrowed it and had paid $40 of the amount
back.
Supervisor Ward bought a sprinkler from the same firm and also bor
rowed money from Mr. Hopkins; It Is understood that two more indictments
on the same transaction will be returned to-morrow.
The arrest of Garrett caused a big sensation in political circles and the
further action of the Grand Jury is awaited with the greatest interest.
ROMANCE OF AN
ARMY HARDTACK
Begins Beautifully, but
Ends Sadly.
LOUISA DUGAN'S GRIEF
BECOMES ENGAGED TO PRIVATE
ROBERT J. BROWN.
Upon His Return From Cuba He Be
comes an Embezzler and Flees
on the Eve of His
Wedding.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEDALIA, Mo., Dec. 7. â An army
hardtack brought a season of happi
ness and then one of grief to pretty
Louise Dugan of East Sedalia, and
started a romance which had a most
unhappy ending last nifeht. When the
war with Spain broke out, Robert J.
Brown was doing well as an insurance
agent in San Francisco, but he was
anxious for a brush with the Dons,
and joined the regular army. When his
regiment passed through Sedalia last
May, hundreds of pretty maidens were
at the depot to wave tiny flags and
cheer the boys in blue. Brown saw
Miss Dugan and handed her a hardtack
upon which was written his name,
number of his company and regiment,
with the request, "Write to me." A
correspondence commenced and re
sulted in an engagement.
Brown was among the soldiers who
; faced shot and shell at San Juan Hill,
: where he was wounded while charging
' the Spanish trenches. When he recov
; ered from his wounds he Avas honor-
I ably discharged for physical disability
i and then came direct to Sedalia, mak
i ing his home at the Dugan residence.
1 While in the army he became a slave
!to drink. He succeeded in hiding his
failing from his bride to be, but it led
him into using his employer's money.
Knowing that his shortage with the in
surance company was liable to be dis
covered at any moment he fled the city
at the hour his bride expected to be
married to him and the wedding party
waited for him in vain. It was almost
midnight before Miss Dugan would be
lieve that she had been deserted. Then
she fainted and the guests departed.

CASSIAR COUNTRY
IS RICH IN GOLD
Reports of Discoveries
Confirmed.
STAMPEDE NEXT YEAR LIKELY
REMARKABLE FINDS MADE BY
PROSPECTORS,
Locations Kept Secret Until the For
tunate Argonauts Can Provide
for Themselves and
Friends.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Dec. 7.â Authentic news
has been received at Wrangel. con
firming the recent reports of new placer
discoveries in the Cassiar mining
country and also to the westward of
Teslin, between Teslin Lake and the
Atlin district. J. H. Rose of Fargo,
manager of the Alaska Mining and
Commercial Company, predicts at
Wrangel that there will be a great
stampede to the Cassiar placers next
summer. Rose's company sent several
men into that country this year under
his direction. One of these found a
stream from which in four days he
alone washed nineteen ounces of gold.
These diggings are reached by way
of the Stickeen River and the road to
Teslin Lake. Their exact location will
not be made public until locations are
made by the party of men whom Rose
will pilot in next spring. Rose is of
the opinion that a railroad will yet be
built from Glf-nora to Teslin. result
ing, he says, in the immediate opera
tion of a number of quartz claims, upon
which assessment work has been done.
Just before Rose left Clenora pros
pectors arrived with new/ of rich
placer discoveries to the northwest of
Teslin, in the direction of Lake Atlin.
Several creeks yielded 10 cents and
upward per pun, and gold was found
from the grass roots down.
Their description shows that these
diggings, and the general characteris
tics of the country, are similar to the
Atlin district. At Glenora. in fact,
there is little doubt that they are on
the eastern edge of the Atlin gold belt.
Several of the lucky prospectors mak
ing these finds are in the employ of
Frank Calbreath, a storekeeper at
Glenora, and John Wright, who keeps
a store at Teslin. Wright attached so
much importance to the find that, de
spite the lateness of the season, he
abandoned his business and has gone
to verify the reports. It is probable
the new diggings will be best reached
via Atlin Lake, in which event the in
tervening country will also be explored.
Rose and his mon will takp into the
Cassiar district next spring modern ap
pliances for developing both placer
and quartz propositions.
CALIFORNIA FRUIT
GROWERS PROTEST
Petition Against Reciprocal Agree
ment With Greece Laid Before
the President.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.â Each member
of the California delegation received to
day from the California Fruit Growers'
Association a protest against the pro
posed agreement with Greece concerning
fruit importations. Greece has been en
deavoring for some time to reach a re
ciprocal agreement which would give her
currants nnd raisins certain advantages.
The Zante. currant people of California
are therefore protesting against the
conclusion of any reciprocal agreement
which would admit the raisins of Greece
by the payment of a minimum duty.
Senator Perkins called on tile Presi
dent and Secretary of State and presented
the remonstrance to-day.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7.â At the regular
meeting of the directors of the Chamber
of Commerce to-day a resolution was
adopted earnestly protesting against the
negotiation of any treaty or the making
of any agreement involving any change
in the tariff with reference to currants or
other fruits. This action was taken be
cause of the reference made by President
McKinley in his message, to the complaint
of the Government of Greece that the
duty imposed on currants of that country
was unjust, the product not coming into
competition with any domestic product.
CALIFORNIA TROOPS

"It is proposed to send regular regi
ments to relieve the volunteers in Manila
just as soon as transportation can be se
cured. The volunteers will be returned to

LYNCH LAW
IN PROSPECT
AT DEL MAR
Reign of Terror in the
Town.
DRINKING WATER POISONED
CRIMES OF INCENDIARIES AND
VANDALS.
Citizen Ordered to Leave the Place
Arms Himself and Issues
a Defiance to the f
Vigilantes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 7.â Del Mar,
twenty miles north of this city, is
aroused over a series of depredations
committed by some unknown person,
and it is not improbable that a lynch
ing will take place if the identity of
the culprit becomes known. A vigilance
committee has been organized, and
Uri Bennett, prom-'-' - of the hotel
that burned there yesterday morning,
has been ordered to leave town within
forty-eight hours. Mr. Bennett refuses
to do so and defies any one to lay a
hand on him. He goes about the streets
armed with a Winchester, and to-day
posted a notice on the postofflce door
that if any one desired to serve papers
on him he could do so through the post
office.
The excitement runs high In the
town. Trouble has been brewing for
months between cor*"'" factions there,
and on Thanksgiving night the big
tank and windmill which supplied the
town with water was burned. There
was no doubt that the work was that
of an incendiary, and as the calamity
was a public one there was talk imme
diately of organizing a vigilance com
mittee and driving the incendiary ouj
of the town. G. W. Bennett, who
owned the property, made no apparent
move to learn who had done him the in
jury.
A night or two later the office of the
Justice of the Peace was wrecked, and
two days afterward a bag of strychnine
was found in a barrel of water used
for drinking purposes by the section
men.
Affairs came to a climax early yester
day morning when the hotel burned
with all its contents. The building
was erected during the "boom" at a
cost of $5000 or more, and stood in the
name of Mrs. Uri Bennett, the wife of
the manager and sister-in-law of
George W. Bennett.
The next surprise in the list of sensa
tions was the notice of a committee of
citizens which was served on Uri Ben
nett, ordering him to leave the town
within forty-eight hours. For his part
Mr. Bennett procured a rifle and a belt
of ammunition, and at last accounts
was marching the streets of the little
town defying the constables, vigilance
committee and citizens generally to lay
a finger on him, and declaring that he
would *not leave the town until he got
ready to do so.
Inquiry fails to show exactly why Mr.
Bennett has been selected as the un
desirable citizen. He certainly did not
burn the hotel, as he was in San Diego
on Monday night.

cessionary incidents to a corporation
chartered for such great purpose."
Attention is then called to the fact
that the concession provides for the
submission of any dispute to arbitra
tion, and it is claimed that this provi
sion operates to prevent any arbitrary
action on the part of Nicaragua.
Dwelling upon Nicaragua's course in
the matter, the committee says:
"How this unexampled condition is
to be dealt with otherwise than by an
express and determined attitude on the
part of the United States is a question
that carries with it the danger of seri
ous embroilment in the near future.
If Nicaragua is not held to the per
formance of her agreement, years will
elapse and many dangers will be en
countered before even a start can be
made toward the construction of a
canal."

PANAMA, Colombia, Dec. 7.â 1 am In
a position to state by the very highest
authority that the statement from
Washington to the effect that an ex
tension of time has been refused to the
new canal company in which to con
struct the canal is absolutely false.
I have just seen a dispatch from Bo
gota which says the bill had passed its
second reading, but Congress having
been called in extraordinary session for
o?ily twenty days, which time has al
ready expired, the measure was laid
over.
Another dispatch states that in view
of the paramount importance of the
question the President will again con
voke Congress to deal with the canal
bill, when it is almost certain an ex
tension of time will be granted.
HOUSE MAY DEFEAT
THE MORGAN BILL
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Everything is ready for the
big fight over the Nicaraguan canal
bill. At a special meeting of the Nica
raguan Canal Committee this morning
it was decided to report the Morgan
bill to the Senate at once and to press
it for immediate consideration. Not
discouraged by the gloomy outlook in
the House the friends of the mea3;:ro
are combining their forces for a prompi
and vigorous campaign in the Senate.
They believe they will succeed, but with
Speaker Reed arrayed in the opposition
in the House they have almost de
spaired of securing action by that body
during the present session. Interviews
I have had with leading members dur
ing the last few days indicate that the
fight for favorable action in the Hous<
is hopeless.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, Dec. 7.â The native press
continues to advocate independence and
reimbursement to the United States of
the amount to be paid Spain for the
Philippines. The Independencia thinks
this course the only Just one. It in
sists that the Filipinos have aided the
Americans solely because they believed
they were fighting for independence.
The paper quotes liberally from Presi
dent McKinley's last speech in Chicago
to support its contention that the
Americans are pledged jto give the
Filipinos independence.
Aguinaldo and his principal advisers
fully recognize the importance of a
strong protectorate in some form. One
of the advisers has even ventured the
assertion that if the Filipinos were
granted independence in accordance
with the demand of the leaders the
United States would be asked to estab
lish a protectorate, as otherwise the
Philippines must sooner or later become
the prey of a less liberal-minded coun
try.
This statement Is borne out by the at
titude of the better class of Filipinos
In the vicinity of Manila. The numer
ous stories as to hostility felt and dis
played on their part toward the Ameri-
cans are without foundation. The
United States authorities expect on the
part of the natives a peaceful accept
ance of the inevitable.
The United States transport New
port, bearing General Miller and staff
and the First Battalion of the Twen
tieth Kansas Regiment, with the
Wyoming Light Battery, which left
San Francisco on November 8, arrived
to-day, closely following the City of
Puebla, which arrived yesterday with
Lieutenant Colonel Childers, twenty
five officers and COO men, including five
companies of the First Tennessee,
Troop A of the Nevada Volunteer Cav
alry, a detachment of recruits for the
Twenty-third Infantry and a detach
ment for the California Heavy Artil
lery.
To provide for the accommodation of
these newcomers will necessitate the
transfer of a number of United States
troops outside the limits of the city
proper.
SHERMAN OPPOSES
COLONIAL POLICY
Ex-Senator's Letter to the Anti

Boston.
BOSTON, Dec. 7.â At a meeting of
the Anti-Imperialist League executive
committee to-day, a letter was read
from John Sherman, saying:
My hope is that the Senate of the United
States will reject the treaty and leave
the people of the Islands free from the
shackles of Spain and the distant domina
tion of the United States. I sympathize
with Aguinaldo in his ambition to found
a republic in the China Sea near the
equator, and hope he may become the
v ashington of a new nation, absolutely
free from European and American in
fluence.
Bishop Potter of New York and

WRITES LETTERS
SAYING HE WILL
KILL HIMSELF
Eugene Hoffman May
Be a Corpse.
A WATER FRONT ROMANCE
EDUCATED GERMAN TIKES OF
STRUGGLE WITH POVERTY.
Said to Be Connected With the Aris
tocracy of Germany, With
Wealthy Relatives in
New York.
Eugene Hoffman, said to be connected
with the aristocracy of Germany and with
wealthy relatives in New York, but who
for some time past has been eking out a
precarious existence doing odd jobs along
the water front, is believed to have com
mitted suicide some time last night.
"Ere this letter reaches its destination
my weary head and aching heart will be
at rest forever," he wrote to his friend,
Joseph Plante, yesterday. "I intend to
take poison to-night and then to make
the wretched affair certain fasten weights
to my neck and slip off an isolated wharf
into the bay."
When Piante, who is a longshoreman, re
turned to his home at the Zunkaiser Hoff,
816 Sansome street, at the end of his
day's work, he found the letter tucked un
der his door. In it was enclosed a simi
lar epistle, addressed to Frank Johnston,
another friend of Hoffman. Plante hast
ened to the California street police sta
tion with the letters and Lieutenant
Esola detailed Officer Garrison to investi
gate the case. The officer learned enough
to satisfy him that the despondent Ger
man had not made the threat in a spirit
of bravado, but was in deadly earnest
when he announced his intention to end
his life. H. Love, foreman for Charles
W. Haseltine, the stevedore, who lives at
11 Green street, where Hoffman also had
a room, says the latter borrowed 25 cents
of him yesterday .and that later he saw
a bottle of strychnine on a table in Hoff
man's room. Early in the afternoon Hoff
man locked his door with a padlock and
went away. He has not been seen since,
and It is believed that his dead body will
be found floating in the bay if it is not
held at the bottom by weights.
Love had frequently given the man em
ployment, but he did not take kindly to
the rough work and would not stick to it
more than a few clays at a time. He be
came so unreliable that even this method
of earning sufficient to keep body and soul
together was at last, closed to him. Then
he began to intimate to those with whom
he was more or less intimate that he
would put an end to worry by committing
suicide.
Hoffman had resided at the Green-street
house for about a year. He is described
as a fine-looking man. about 40 years old,
standing about 5 feet 10 inches and weigh
ing ISO pounds: with black hair and a
heavy black mustache. He was well edu
cated, as the chirography and grammati
cal construction of his letters show. YVhila
he seldom spoke of his personal affairs or
the reasons for his becoming an outcast,
from remarks he dropped from time to
time it is believed his fall from grace was
primarily due to domestic troubles. He
kept a large number of papers In his
room, and they may aid in throwing some
light on his previous existence, provided
he did not destroy them previous to car
rying out his threat.
Travelers at the Play.
Members of the California Commercial
Travelers' Association will lay aside the
cares of business to-night and attend the
performance of "Cyrano de Bergerac" at
the Tivoli. The men who compose tha
â¢well-known organization have looked for
ward to their annual theater party and
to-night they will rill the opera house.
Representatives of the large wholesale
houses of this city and hundreds of re
tailers compose the association. Presi
dent Alex McDonald. Vice-President Har
ry Stokes, Harry Roessler and Secretary
Charles H. McLane have exerted them
selves to make the annual affair a suc
cess, and judging by the number of tick
ets already disposed of, it cannot be other
wise.

MORE OF THE
METHODS OF
MAJOR MOORE
His Secret Deal With
Wong Sam.
TOLD OF CONTEMPLATED RAID
MANY INSTANCES OF TREASURY
AGENT'S DUPLICITY.
Exposure of His Escapades Drives
Him Into a Cider Debauch.
Sequel to a Famous
Luncheon.
Major Horace A. Moore, Sppclal Aprent
of the Treasury, has taken to dissipation
Fince The Call's exposure of his detestable
conduct toward a defenseless woman.
Major Moore has long: made it his boast
that he was strictly temperate In his
habits, that no intoxicants ever passed his
lips, and his abhorrence of those who did
tipple was expressed in the most violent
terms.
Cut last Monday, after his hidden life
had been given to the world, the major
grew desperate, and, summoning a mes
senger, he dispatched him for two gallons
of the juice of the apple. i*he messenger
soon returned wiih a huge demijohn, and
the major proceeded to Inaugurate a
wild, to-hades-with-my-enemies cider de
bauch that must astonish those who have
looked upon the major as a model man.
But while Moore has been reveling In
tys cider jag others have been busy dig
ging Into his record, with the result that
fresh charges have been forwarded to the
Treasury Department, one of which may
cost him much more than his position.
This charge, which is fully substantiated,
accuses the Treasury Agent of having
'tipped off" to Wong Sam, a Chinese
broker at 81S Washington sireet, the time
Bet for the famous "Omaha raid." Brieily,
the Omaha raid was a round-up of the
Chinese men and women who were landed
on special certificates for the purpose of
participating in the Omaha Fair. They
were obliged to return to China within
three months after the close of the expo
sition, but many of them escaped and
made their way to San Francisco.
The raid was planned by Moore and
Collector of Customs Jackson, those two
being the only ones to know of it. Some
lime before the raid The Call gave a list
nf the women thus unlawfully remaining
in this country, the houses in Chinatown
where they were held as chattels and the
prices paid" for them by their owners. The
i.ay of the publication of this list a Call
reporter called on Major Moore, who at
demanded to know the source of
The Call's information. The reporter de
clined to tell, and the major continued:
"1 know well enough you got it from
Wong Sam. He's trying to blackmail
those people." .
That statement was a practical admis
sion that Moore and the Chinaman were
'â¢doing: business" with one another. Wong
Fa.ni may have endeavored to blackmail
those people, but if so the question natur
ally arises how Major Moore knew he
had any knowledge of them or what his
object was, unless the major waa in part
nership with Sam.
After the raid Moore, in company with
Miss. Cameron of the Presbyterian Mls
k'iii, wi nt to District Attorney Foote's
t ili.Â«'. Moore told Foote that two of the
raptured women claimed to have been
born in Ran Francisco and had never been
but of the State. Moore admitted that he
had no evidence against them. Foote re
plled that under the circumstances all he
could do would be to enter a nolle pros
In their cases, to which Moore answered
that anything Foote did would be satis
factory to them. This was done and
Moore then told the reporters that FootÂ©
had turned two of the women loose and
Insinuated that there was something
{rooked in the affair. When A. H. Yordl,
counsel for the women, saw that he took
the District Attorney to task for dismiss
ing the cases without consulting him.
Foote was wroth over the imputation and
told the reporters all about Muore's du
plicity.
Something like a year and a half ago
DeWltt C. Jackson, now a resident of
Brooklyn, N. V., was a special deputy
under Moore. Somebody preferred charges
of dereliction of duty against Jackson.
Moore wrote to the Secretary of the
Treasury stating that there was no truth
whatever In the charges. He showed the
letter to Jackson and then sent it to
Washington. A day or two later Moore
Wrote another letter stating that he was
i"iivinced the charges were true and se
cretly mailed it to the Secretary. Both
letters were on file in the department
und will be used at Moore's trial as fur
ther proof of his duplicity.
There is also on file in the Treasury De
partment a communication from B. E.
Meredith, chief of the Chinese Bureau,
charging that he accused Major Moore
with having secretly given certain Infor
mation to the press and that Moore re
plied that the reporters "had him in a
corner" and he was forced to tell them
what he knew.
One of the major's love affairs that
promises to be fully ventilated with the
others is that In which the putative wife
nf Foss, the smuggler, was the recipient
of his attentions for a long time after
FosÃ was sent to San Quentln. It is al
leged that Moore, who was active In the
prosecution of the Foss-Ciprico gang
was possessed of considerable evidence
against the woman, but Instead of having
her placed on trial, he lavished his at
tentions upon her to such an extent that
the oouple became the subject of com
tnon gossip around the Federal building
It is certain that there was much truth
In the rumors that the major's love affair
was only prevented from being given to
the world by Major Moore purchasing
the exclusive privilege of reading the
story.
There is a sequel to the famous lunch
eon in which Moore and Sam Ruddell
Indulged. Moore invited Ruddell to
lunch one day when Rnddell was deputy
rollcctor under W. T>. Knclish, and after
enjoying a juicy duck, with accessories
walked out of the restaurant, leaving

FIRED BEHIND HIS EAR.
The Marital Troubles of William J. Martin, a
Bartender, and His Wife, Eva, End in Her
Attempting to Murder Him.
DRIVEN* to desperation by thÂ«
cruel treatment and threats of her
husband, Mrs. Eva Martin tired
three shots from a revolver at
him yesterday morning, but only one
took effect.
The husband Is William J. Martin,
a barkeeper, at present out of employ
ment, lie and his Wife separated
about two weeks ago, and she engag
ed a room at 119 Ninth street. Mar
tin had been writing her urging her
to return to him, but she paid no at
tention to his letters. On Tuesday she
received a note from him to meet him
in a room In the St. David's House,
and she went, determined that It would
be the last interview she would have
with him.
The interview was not a pleasant
one, and she put an end to It as soon
as possible, telling him to go his way
and she would go hers. Martin refused
to allow her to go out of his sight.
and followed her home. He threat
ened that if *he persisted in not liv
ing with him he would kill her. She
was afraid of him, and temporarily
gave In to his demands. Yesterday
morning she wanted him to get up
and provide breakfast for her. He used
an offensive term, and turned his back
to her. pretending that he was going
to sleep again. She was seized with a
desire to teach him a lesson, and, pro
curing a revolver, placed the muzzle
behind his left ear and fired three
shots In rapid succession.
Alarmed at what she had done, she
rushed out of the room and went to
the grocery underneath the lodging
house. A telephone message was sent
to the Southern police statfon, ana
Ruddell to pay the bill. The following
day Mr. English sent for Ruddell and
gravely informed him that serious
charges had been preferred against him
by Special Agent Moore. Mr. English
proceeded to read the charges, which
alleged that on the preceding day Ruddell
had occupied an hour and a half at
luncheon; that on the way to his meal he
had drunk a cocktail; that at lunch he
had eaten an underdone duck, which was
altogether too rich food to be taken into
the stomach; that he also consumed one
bottle of wine, all of which was preju
dicial to the good of the service. Ruddell
admitted the truth of the charges and
was subjected to his superior's reproaches
for not having been made a party to the
feast. It was at first thought that the
charges were in the nature of a joke on
Moore's part, but later events proved
that It was but another Instance of his
despicable methods of getting others into
trouble.
ESCAPED WITH A WETTING.
Attorney General Fitzgerald's Daugh
ter, While Walking on the Beach,
Falls Into the Surf.
Miss Helen K. Fitzgerald, the only
daughter of Attorney General W. F. Fitz
gerald, while walking on the beach near
Fort Point yesterday, fell into the surf.
She was quickly pulled out by one of the
many people in the vicinity, and was tak
en to a near-by boat house to await her
father's arrival.
An evening paper devoted much space
and black type to a recital of her allo^d
narrow escape, and the Attorney General
is much pained thereat. When seen yes
terday he said his daughter had gone
out to witness a game of golf, and. tiring
of the scene, had walkea. as was her
usual custom, along the beach, which la
level and perfectly safe. "Being interest
ed in drawing," he said, "3Tlss Helen was
in search of a subject when, overcome
by exhaustion, she fell into the water.
She was not in a particle of danger, and
the man who pulled her out was only wet
to the knees. As soon as I was apprised
of my daughter's accident I hurried to
her and tooK her home in a carriage. She
is now entirely recovered from her dip.
I regret exceedingly the undue notoriety
given to the incident."
The srtarbuck's Crew.
The burned ship W. IT. Starbuck, -with
lumber from Port Blakeley for South

names of which were sent from Port

for sea this crew deserted, which caused
delay In sailing, on account of the scarcity
of men.

Primary Law Discussed.
A meeting of the sub-committee on
primary law was held last evening in the
Crocker building. Many suggestions were
advanced and fully discussed. After con
siderable debate it was decided to refer
the whole matter to Senator Stratton and
T. Carl Spelling for full consideration.
They will report the progress of their
work at the next meeting of the whole
committee, to be held next Monday even
ing in the office of M. M. Estee.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER S, 1898.
Policemen McQuade and Klnch were
sent to Investigate. They found Mrs.
Martin in the grocery, and she admit
ted that she had fired the shots at her
husband. She asked them to allow
her to go upstairs for her coat and
hat, and they went up with her. Mar
tin opened the door to admit them,
and when the officers saw blood oozing
from a wound behind his left ear they
rang for the patrol wagon and had him
conveyed to the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Kinne found that only one bullet
had taken effect, and it had entered
the mastoid process of the temporal
bone and inflicted a painful but not
dangerous wound. Martin was so nerv
ous that no attempt was made to ex
tract the bullet. His ear and hair were
powder marked.
Mrs. Martin was taken to the City
Prison and a charge nf assault to mur
der was booked agninst her. She is a
pleasant-faced woman about 27 jrettl
of age. Her first Inquiry was as to the
nature of her husband's wound, and
when told that it was not dangerous
she said: "I am so glad, as I only did
it to scare him. After six years of
married life I was forced to leave him
owing to his cruel treatment. When
he got intoxicated, which was very
often, he would abuse me shamefull".
I have been a good wife to him and I
love him now better than any other
man in the world. He threatened to
kill me last night and I was afraid
he would carry out his threat. It was
therefore his life or mine." She would
not admit that jealousy had anything
to do with the shooting.
Martin did everything he could to
shield his wife. He said he was asleep
CATHOLICS OBSERVE
A SACRED FEAST
IMMACULATE CONCEPTION TO BE
SOLEMNLY COMMEMORATED.
Services in All the Catholic Churches
Throughout the Cityâ History
of the Devotion.
The annual feast of the Immaculate
Conception will be solemnly commemorat
ed to-day In the Catholic churches
throughout the city. Masses will be cele
brated as on Sundays and the day will be
one of strict obligation. At St. Mary's
Cathedral the first mass will be said at 6
o'clock in the morning and the last at
10:30 o'clock, which will be solemn high
in form. In the evening benediction and
the rosary will constitute the religious
service and conclude the solemnities of
the day.
At St. Ignatius Church, in addition to
the regular service by the congregation,
special exercise* in honor of the feast will
be held l>y the members of the Gentle
men's Sodality and other organizations of
the church in their respective assembly
halls in the basement of the church build
ing on Hayes street.
The annual celebration of this divine
prerogative granted the Virgin has be
come general throughout the entire world
where the principles of Christianity exist.
The history of the devotion is both inter
esting and instructive. It is taught in the
church that in order to bring forth the
Redeemer the Virgin must have had a
prerogative superior to humanity. It is
contended that the Sovereign Judge must
have suspended the general effect of his
severe law in favor of her who came Into
the world for no other purpose than to
contribute to the accomplishment of the
most secret, most incomprehensible of
the works of Godâ the incarnation of the
Messiah. Notwithstanding the silence of
the gospel, it has been generally believed
that the Virgin, with a view to her divine
maternity, was held back, as it were, on
the brink of the abyss which the fatal
disobedience of our first parents opened
under our feet, und that her conception
was as immaculate as her life.
This belief, which the Greeks borrowed
from Palestine, and adopted with enthusi
asm, led to the institution of the Feast of
the Immaculate Conception, which was
celebrated at Constantinople as early as
the sixth century. William the Conqueror
established the feast in Normanay as
early as 1074. From Normandy its observ
ance passed over to the English. The first
council of Oxford, held by Stephen Lang
ton, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the
year 1222. places It in the number of holi
days of obligation.
In France in the year 1288 a Bishop of
Paris, Renoul do Hombiere, left a consid
erable sum to found the office of this Feast
of the Virgin, which was introduced at
the same time in the territory of Lyons.
A manuscript of martyrology of the thir
teenth century, found in the library of the
Dominicans of Dijon, marks the feast of
the conception qn the Bth of December,
which shows conclusively that in the time
of St. Dominic it was almost universally
celebrated in the church.
Devotion to the Immaculate Conception
of the Virgin was popular in Western Eu
rope from the middle ages, but It is main
tained that Spain has shown the greatest
zi j al and ardor in the propagation of this
doctrine. The Spanish nation professes to
have celebrated it in the early part of the
seventh century. In 1394 Don John I of
Aragon instituted it. He claims, however,
that his predecessors had celebrated the
feast long before him.
In England and France the Feast of
in the room when some one shot him.
He saw a retreating figure, but could
not say whether it was that of a man
or woman. The wound in his head
caused him to fall to the floor and he
was unable to follow the figure.
In his pockets was found a pair of
brass knuckles, but he would not say
why he carried such a murderous
weapon. A letter was also found from
his wife, dated November 30, in whN'h
she referred to their separation and
his intention to leave the city. She
reiterated her love for him and chiried
him for vilifying her to her friends and
for his cruel treatment of her. She
accused him on more fhan one occa
sion of compelling her to place her life
In jeopardy.
Friends of Martin say that he will
not prosecute his wife and she will es
cape punishment.
Mary was called the Feast of the Nor
mans. As early as the year 1525 the Span
lards in Mexico erected the splendid
( athedral of Puebla de Los Angeles under
the invocation of the Immaculate Virgin.
JOY IN SUNSET VALLEY.
The Favored Section to Be Provided
With Water and Fire Pro
tection.
The determination of the Sunset Valley
Improvement Club to obtain from the
Supervisors both a water supply for do
mestic use and also protection against
fire has at last been rewarded. The
board on last Monday Instructed Clerk
Russell to advertise for bids for the erec
tion of an engine house on Tenth avenue,
between I and J streets. As soon as the
house is built a combination chemical en
gine and hose cart will ;be housed there.
This is precisely what the members of
the improvement club had been contend
ing for during the past two years and
now, having obtained It, they, with the
residents and property owners of the Sun
set Valley, are filled with joy.
â  Added to this much-needed tire protec
tion and with the view of rendering every
safeguard for the protection of the dwell
ings fifty-six hydrants will be distributed
throughout the valley. To meet all re
quirements in this direction the Spring
Valley Water Company has been notified
to run mains through all of the graded
streets In the Sunset section of the city
The. improvements here mentioned have
all been secured for the section south of
Golden Gate Park through the indomit
able persistency and pluck of such men
as President Keller and Edward Ewald
Jr., chairman of the executive committee
who labored consistently and â  con"ci
tiously with the object of getting Sunset
Valey improved from its share , of the
PU tV C f ,f' ls Paid by its property owners.
It is thought that before the winter is
over an attempt will be made to continue
Dewey boulevard from its southern end
to the park, along Seventh avenue to X
street, where it has been extended on its
northern side. With the completion of
this boulevard one of the most pictur
esque drives in the city would be thrown
open, leading from the .Golden Gate Park
Into San Mateo County and the southern
portion of our own city.
The grading of Nineteenth avenue from
the park southward has been knocked in
the head, so to speak, for the present.
tiut it is. the intention of the promoters
of the scheme to again rally public
opinion and the Interest of some of the
property owners who have been opposed
to its grading as soon as the new board
of Supervisors is in office. ;' â 
â  The Market-street Railroad Company
has started on the branch line of Its elec

A Slight Shock.
OAKLAND, Dec. 7. - From several

A Race Against Fire.
After a ten-days' fight to avoid death, the
crew of a steamer from Spain recently arrived
in Baltimore. In mldocean it was discovered
that flames were raging in the vessel's hold
For ten long days the crew bravely fought the
flames. If men would fight as persistently
against disorders of the stomach and diges
tive organs, there would be fewer premature
deaths. The best weapon for such a fight is
Hrmtetter's Stomach Bitters. It is the greatest
of tonics, and the bÂ»i>t of r^med'es fcr Kidney,
liver, bladder and blood disorders.

COLNON'S FRANK TESTIMONY
EACH COMMISSIONER WAS GIV
EN A SLICE.
President of the Board I>espairs of
Civil Service and Yields
to the Pressure of
Politics.
The sessions of the Senate Investigat
ing Committee were enlivened yesterday
by the president of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners, who was called to
the witness stand to give his opinion re
garding water front administration and
his views on the construction of the Unioa
ferry depot.
The versatile Mr. Colnon, who Is soon
to retire from public service, expressed
the opinion that the eastern gallery of
the depot as designed and constructed
was of no use whatever. The impression.
In the mind of the witness that architect
ure was not an exact science was stamped
again at every sight of the unoccupied
gallery.
Inquiry was directed by General Dick
inson regarding Mr. Robinson, who was
the superintendent of construction.
Commissioner Colnon said that Robin
son came to the board highly commended
as a capable man, who had built the
Stockton Insane Asylum under the direc
tion of Architect Percy. According to
the testimony Robinson was then a Re
publican and no evidence was adduced to
show that he had since changed his polit
ical faith.
When the attention of Mr. Colnon was
directed incidentally to the fact that the
mezzanine story of the depot is still un
finished the witness remarked that there
was no demand upon the part of the State
officers for offices in the building, hence
the decision was reached to cut out the
partitions. The State Mining Bureau and
State Board of Trade will occupy space
on that floor.
On the subject of wharves Mr. Colnon
said the biggest wharf in San Francisco
was a mere toy compared with the South
ern Pacific wharf at Santa Monica. Big
and enduring wharves of Puget Sound
were described. The piles in the substan
tial Spreckels wharf at San Diego cost
$50 apiece, so the witness had heard.
On the topic of special counsel fees the
president of the board testified that au
thority for employment of extra counsel
was derived from the Attorney General.
General Dickinson obtained a statement
from the secretary of amounts paid out
for extra counsel during the last two fis
cal years. F. S. Stratton received fees
as follows: $250, $500. $300, $300. $300, $750.
J. C. Campbell received $100 for an opin
ion. Meanwhile the regular attorney
Tirey L. Ford, received $4800. The amount
disbursed in four years ior legal services
VU ? 14. 050.
CpmmlmlOfiar Colnon, becoming genial
and ingenuous as the inquiry progressed,
took the committee into his confidence
ami gave his own Impression of the spoils
system as applied to the administration
of water front affairs. He spoke of the
purchasing bureau as a department of
great value, but to be useful it should be
divorced from politics. Adjoining the
quarters of the Doard's storekeeper he
remarked, is the office of the Southern
Pacific storekeeper. One man at a salary
of $12a serves the railroad company. He
supplies eighteen steamers, attends to the
laundry work and looks after many other
things. The board's storekeeper gets $175
a month and has an assistant receiving
$75. The witness said the board's store
keeper was appointed to act as a check
on the disbursement of supplies and a sav
ing of an amount equal to the salaries of
the Commissioners had been broueht
about.
Recurring again to politics on the water
front, Commissioner Colnon testified that
the number of employes could be cut
down. He called the water front the
â¢â¢dumping ground of the halt from all
sections of the State."
"We have no more use for special police
than we have for soldiers," said Mr. Col
non. "I plead guilty to appointment of
two. One was appointed from Sierra
County on the demand of the Democrats
of that county. I had to appoint him or
get out myself."
Commissioner Harney suggested that
watchmen were employed years ago, and
that the special police took the place of
the watchmen; but the president of the
board insisted that the Harbor police
never made an arrest.
General L-ickinson asked Commissioner
Colnon to express his views regarding the
extension of the seawall south. Mr. Col
non remarked that a bill providing for the
prolongation of the wall passed the Legis
lature two years ago, but was vetoed by
Governor Budd because it allowed the ex
penditure of a very large amount of pub
lic money for advertising for proposals.
The Legislature, he thought, ought to
pass some kind of a measure for seawall
extension.
Assembling after the noon recess, Sen
ators Dickinson, Prisk and Boyce found
Commissioner Colnon reminiscent in fancy
and communicative as ever, in fact.
"Blessings brighten as they take their

. The doctor wants each sufferer from
Asthma,; Hay ;â  Fever or Bronchitis in this
city to call and get one. When asked re-
garding his reasons for giving his remedy
away in this manner, he said: "People
are naturally skeptical about an astHma

ber of so-called 'cures' on the market you
can hardly blame them. Now. I claim
that my Cure cures. It will Instantly re-

flight," and as the Commissioner is about
; to take his flight back to Stockton he was
brighter than common when he told of
his efforts in the cause of civil service on
the water front. In all the vast popula
tion of enlightened and progressive people
in California he found but one sympa
thetic soul to join him in the good cause
; or civil service, and that was the soul of
bam Moffett. A letter was produced to
show that Sam promised to let his edi
torial work slide for a day and go down
to the board's office and mingle his aspi
rations with those of Commissioner Col- j
non for water front reform. Letters were
received from Hugh Craig, president of i
the Chamber of Commerce, and Theodore |
Roosevelt, president of the Civil Service !
Commission, but neither Craig nor Roose
velt agreed, like Sam Moffett, to go right
down to the brink of the water and battle
for the cause of civil service. Things
might have been different if Mr. Colnon
had not lost faith in his own ability. Ac
cording to his testimony yesterday, he
gave up the fight for reform and joined
the ranks of the spoilsmen.
General Dickinson, who was never
known to shy at a programme, asked:
"What is the system now, Mr. Colnon?"
Promptly the president of the board an- '
swered: "The plan is to cut the patron
age into three pieces as you would cut a
pie, and give each of the three commis
sioners his piece."
Commissioner Harney blushed a little
water front blushlet. and Rudolph Herold,
the new member, paled a trifle.
"Upon my word," continued the com
municative Mr. Colnon, "I did not know
that a certain man was an employe of the
board until It came out in the newspapers
that he had figured as a principal in a
prize-fight. Then I learned that he was
the chief of the sweeper?."
Genera.l Dickinson asked: "Is any. one
required to see that the employes perform :
their duty?"
Mr. Colnon replied: "The president of:
the board is supposed to see that em- i
ployes are attentive to their duties: but '
I have found it utterly futile to attempt |
alone to reform the spoils system. I could
not hold out against the internal pressure I
for places without being considered a I
crank."
Some questions were asked by Henry '
J. Smith, painter and polisher, and mem- '
ber of the firm- of H. Smith & Son, to I
ascertain if Contractor William Cronan
paid anything to the firm for painting j
work done on the roof. The witness knew !
that his firm received $12,900 for painting :
according to the contract, but did not I
know whether anything was received >.
from Mr. Cronan. The books of the
painting firm may be called for. Mr.
Cronan took a contract to paint the con
cealed portions of the corrugated iron,
and under that contract painted the en
tire surface, or got Smith to paint it.
G. LEGALLET A BENEDICT.
Son of the Well-Known Liquor Mer
chant Weds Miss Celina Chabot.
George Legallet, son of the well known
wine merchant, and Miss Celina Chabot
were married last evening at the French
Church on Bush street. The ceremony
was performed by the Rev. A. A. Loude,
pastor of the church, assisted by aco
lytes and one of the associate priests of
the community. During the service the
"Voni Creator" and "Aye Maria" were
sung by a specially augmented choir un
der the direction of Organist S. Martinez.
At the conclusion of the marriage service
the couple repaired to the brides f(irmn
home, on Taylor street, where the mar
riage supper was spread before a large
circle of friends and relative.

SURPRISES AT OAKLAND
CROSSMOLINA NICELY RIDDEN
BY NASH TURNER.
TJlm Finished Behind Dunpraise.
Novia a Fast One â Our Climate
in Great Form â Five
Choices Downed.
It was a disastrous day for favorites
at Oakland yesterday, Our Climate, which
showed extremely good form, being the
only our- to wear a pair of brackets. The
most notable outsider to win a purse was
Alicia. The Oregon-bred mare was a
starter in the last event of the day, and
so lightly were her chances considered
that 20 to 1 was obtainable. Her previous
race was a jrood one. and the calculators
backed at odds down to 10. She was rid
den to the be=t advantage by Eddie Jones,
and l^d Myth, the 7 to 10 favorite, past
the judges by three lengths. New Moon,
looking B winner at the head of the
stretch, finished third.
BoQkmaker Caesar Young-'s filly Clar
ar.rio appeared to good advantage in the
opening- scramble for two-year-olds. With
Eddfe .I'-ines in the saddle, the ling laid
6 to I about her. and she won easily from
Correct. The latter was Plow to begin
work, but made a brilliant run through
â¢â â¢'tch.
In the seven-furlong run that followed
Durpraise, after many attempts., finally
won a purse. Better than 4 to 1 was laid
Bt him, and he won all the way.
The favorite, Ulm, apparently could not
keep up the first part, but managed to
take the place from Pat Murphy.
Had Spencer, who rode the favorite,
ilen^s. in the third number, followed
orders, the fast filly would undoubtedly
have had her number exhibited on top.
Striking the stretch with a commanding
lead, he attempted to rate her, and when
challenged by Turner on Crnssmollna was
passed and bf-aten a length. Hemera.
under Alike Hennessy's clever piloting,
ran third. Rio Chico was away poorly,
and was unable to get to the front, though
showing a good sample of speed.
Dan HÂ«nig's gelding. Our Climate, was
in remarkably tine fettle yesterday. He
was installed a 9 to 10 favorite for the
mile and a sixteenth run, and stepping off
the first mile In 1:40 flat, won in rollicking
fashion from Vc-loz, the second choice.
McFarlane ran consistently, taking the
â how.
It is quite evident that Novia is a
Bprinter of the improving sort. Starting:
second choice to Chihuahua in the six-fur
long spin, fifth on the card, she made all
the pace and won hands down in 1:13%.
Imperious ran into the show.
Track Notes.
E<ldfe Jones carried off the riding honors
by piloting tv.-o winners.
Charley Thorpe, who rode Anchored in
the third race, was jammed against the
rail and had one of his ankles badly
bruised. A physician was called to at
tend him.
'Kid" Weller, the extensive turf opera
tor, will arrive here on Saturday next.
Willie Dean, who rode Pat Murphy, is a
very competent lad In the saddle, hut as
yet has had little opportunity to distin
himself.

Room, but the Attempt Fails.
Rosie Ricks, a girl not yet 20 years of
' ! age. hired a room in the Lexington House,
i Eddy and Taylor streets, Tuesday night
and retired about midnight, after turning
: on the gap, as she was tired of life and
â wanted to die. Three hours later the door

, found unconscious in bed. She was sent
: to the Receiving Hospital in the ambu-
I lance, and was brought back to conscious
â  ness after two hours' hard work.
She returned from Jackson. Amador

out funds or friends got disgusted with
the life she was leading and came to the
| conclusion to end it all. She is a pro
: nounoed blonde and rather pretty. She
i declared she would not renew the attempt.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1898.
STRANGLING IN HIS CELL.
Gas Strand, a Powerfully Built Man,
Attempts Twice to Commit Sui
cide in the City Prison â Is Put
in a Padded OIL
GUS STRAND, a powerfully built man, walked into the City Prison
yesterday morning about 11 o'clock, saying he wanted to surrender
himself, as he understood a warrant was out for his arrest for obtain
ing money by false pretenses. He was loud and boisterous in his
manner and talk, and it was evident that he had been on a debauch. Ser
geant Wolfe made inquiry, and ascertained there was no such warrant.
Strand became so violent that he wns locked up in the "drunk" cell.
About an hour later Sergeant Wolfe was passing the "drunk" cell, and
was surprised to see Strand hanging by the neck and slowly strangling.
He had tied one end of his suspenders to a wooden post, and, making a
noose with the other end, slipped it around his neck. He was on his feet,
but leaning backward and throwing his whole weight upon the suspenders.
The cell was quickly opened and the suspenders cut in two. Strand ap
peared to be in a faint, and he was sent to the Receiving Hospital In
the patrol wagon. Dr. Eunnnell soon brought him aroun< and he was sent
back to the prison.
As he entered the cell he said to Wolfe: "You've cheated me this
time, but you can't cheat me again,"' and, lowering his head, he made a
rush at the brick wall. He was tripped up, and as he became very
violent his hands were handcuffed behind him and he was sent to the in
sane ward in the hospital, where he was strapped down in a padded cell,
and two "trusties" were placed in the cell beside him, for fear he might
break loose from his bonds and injure himself.
Strand is an ex-cavalryman, and for a time kept a saloon at 646 Fol
som street. He has been several times arrested by the police for minor
offenses, and as a rule managed to escape punishment.

MILITARY HONORS AT LIEUTEN
ANT NOLAN'S FUNERAL.
The Remains of the Beloved Soldier
Were Interred in the National
Cemetery at the Presidio.
The remains of the late First Lieutenant
James E. Nolan. Fourth United States
Cavalry, were laid to rest yesterday af
ternoon in the beautiful national ceme
tery at the Presidio. The funeral took
place at 2 o'clock, and all the military
honors of the post were accorded the
greatly beloved soldier. At least a thou
sand civilians attended the funeral.
The ceremonies were extremely im
pressive, and the wealth of floral tributes
were the handsomest ever seen at the
Presidio. Two troops of the Fourth Cav
alry, two batteries of the Thiru Artil
lery and three companies of the Eighth
California Regiment participated in the
ceremonies. The cortege was headed by
the Fourth Cavalry band, which rendered
Chopin's funeral march and the "Dead
March From Saul." Trumpeter Hardy of
the Fourth Cavalry, formerly chief trum
peter of the Seventh, who blew taps over
General Sherman, performed the same
service yesterday.
Nearly all the officers in and around
the city were present ana the funeral
procession was nearly half a mile in
length The sen-"- were read by Father
Prenato, the Catholic chaplain at the
Presidio. The remains were conveyed
from Lieutenant Nolan's lome to the
cemetery on a caisson draped with the
national colors, and directly behind this
was led Satan, the favorite charger of the
officer with his sword and boots reversed.
In the history of the fresldlo there has
never bÂ«en such a general outpouring of
civilians and soldiers as there was yester
day, or such manifestation of genuine sor
row.
MIDWEEK NOTES
OF THE PLAY
The Comedy Theater Is making out a
good week with "Ole Olson," a Swedish
comedy, well known to local theater
goers "South Before the War" is an
nounced as the "senstion show" for the
new week.
"The Private Secretary" and Miss Vell
ler's clever curtain-raiser, "Keeping Up
Appearances," make a strong bill at the
Alcazar. There is lots of fun left in Gil
lette's famous adaptation and the cur
tain-raiser is duplicating the success it
enjoyed at the Baldwin some years ago,
when the Palmer company produced It.
"Gayest Manhattan" finishes this week
at the Columbia, giving way to the re
vival of Evans and Hoey's "A Parlor
Match."
"A Boy Wanted" still draws the crowd
to the California. Daniel Sully comes
Sunday night with a new piece, "Uncle
Bob."
"Cyrano" finishes its fortnight at the
Tivoii with Sunday night's performance.
Then come? a week of "The Mascot" and
then the big holiday spectacle, "The Yel
low Dwarf."
Two very successful and very different
special attractions of the Orpheum bill
are Camillo Urso, the vloliniste, and Paul
Batty's acrobatic bears.
"Blacklisted," a sensational melodrama,
relieved by several specialties, is the
week's bill at Morosco's.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan. 1017-1023 Mission.
ROSSEiI'S SECOND TRIAL.
The Filling of the Jury Box Was
Accomplished Without Difficulty.
The second trial of Walter Rosser, a
private in the Tennessee Regiment,
charged with the murder of Henry Hll
debrand, opened before Judge Wallace
yesterday morning. Acting District At
torney Walter Hinkle represented the
prosecution and as in the first trial W.
H. L.. Barnes appeared as counsel for the
defendant. Relatives of young Hilde
brand were present and evinced the deep
est Interest in the proceedings.
From the questions put to talesmen it
was readily deducted that General Barnes
will make the tight for the young sol
nier s life on the contention that when
the crime was committed Rosser waa
morally Irresponsible by reason of having
been drugged. By noon twelve men were
selected to try the case and this morn
ing the taking of testimony will begin

CHARLES G. LEE
S AID TO BE IN
SAN FRANCISCO
Missing Chicago Man
Reported Found.
CASE IS FULL OF MYSTERY
CHIEF LEES DENIES KNOWLEDGE
OF THE AFFAIR.
Repudiates a Telegram Crediting Him
With Claiming to Have Located
the Man in the Palace
Hotel.
According 1 to information received from
Chicago, Charles G. Lee. who mysterious
ly disappeared from the Hotel del Prado
in that city two months ago, has been
located in San Francisco by Chief of Po
lice Lees. According to Chief Lees, tne
missing man has not been located by him
or any onÂ© else connected with his de
partment. The Chief 6ays he never
heard of the missing: man, and advances
the opinion that the author of the report
of his being located in this city is ro
mancing.
If the Chief is not trying to conceal the
I facts in the case for reasons of his own,
the report sent out from Chicago acids
another peculiar feature to an unusually
j peculiar affair. Lee -was a prosperous
! cigar merchant, having a stand in the Del
i Prado Hotel and another a short dis
tance from that hostelry. His affairs were
1 in excellent shape, and there was no con
: ceivable reason why he should drop out
lof sight. But drop out of sight he did,
I and in such a sudden and mysterious
manner that his friends feared he had
I met with foul play. He left the hotel one
â¢ evening last fall to go to his place about
two blocks distant, and has not been seen
from that day to the present time.
When two days passed and he did not
I return his friends notified the police and
| a systematic search was begun, but with- \
\ out result. Photographs ana circulars |
I describing the missing merchant were
\ sent to the police of all tfie leading cities
j in the country, and it is this fact that
I throws the shadow of doubt on the as-
I sertion of Chief Lees that he never heard
of the man. The doubt as to the Chief's
I sincerity is further increased by the
; positive assertion of George Reisihg of j
Chicago, one of Lee's most intimate i
friends, that he had received a letter from i
the San Francisco Chief to the effect that
he had recognized Lee among the em
ployes of the Palace Hotel from phofo
graphs sent out at the time of his disap
pearance, and that a letter containing
more detailed information was on its way
to Chicago. All this is as positively de
nied by Chief Lees; but as Mr. Reising
is a man of some standing in the Windy
City it seems strange that ne should make
such an assertion without reason or foun
dation.
At the Palace nothing la known of Lee
or any man answering to "Rls description; !
but as he would in all probability have !
assumed another name and changed his
appearance this is not surprising.
When Lee disappeared he is believed to '
have had quite a sum of money on his ;
person, as he was accustomed to go about !
j well supplied with funds, and tor this ,
j reason it was feared he had been foully I
dealt with. He always dressed well, but
was not inclined to dissipate, and, as he i
was a single man, without financial or
domestic troubles of any kind, the only
theory to account for his disappearance,
aside from possible murder, was that he
had become suddenly insane and wander
ed away from the city If he is in San
Francisco Chief. Lees is the only man
able to tell, and if the Cnief knows he
is apparently inclined to keep the infor- I
mation for tne present
It has been unkindly intimated that the
Chief really though he recognized one of
the Palace employes as the missing man,
and sent the telegram to Reising. and
then, learning that he had made a blun
der, concluded to save himself from rid
icule by denying all knowledge of the
case.
Died of His Injuries.
John Longfleld, an advertising can
vasser, died last Tuesday morning in the
City and County Hospital from injuries
received a few days ago by being thrown
from his wagon.

EVADING CIVIC DUTY.
WHENEVER a trial results in miscarriage of
justice â and that such results are frequent will
not be denied â there is an outcry against the
inefficiency of the courts. The men who make it first
and loudest are themselves to blame. They refuse to
perform jury duty.
Because a citizen has large business interests is no
reason he should be able to whisper an excuse into
the ear of the Judge and then permitted to go his
way. He is as able to endure the tedium of a trial
as another man. He can far better afford the loss of
time than can his neighbor who toils for wages.
The opening of every notable case is marked by a
pitiful exhibition of lack of regard for the public wel
fare. Talesmen will plead all manner of pretexts for
being allowed immunity from the jury-box. They
have even been known to lie about it, in which in
stance, instead of being fined for contempt of court,
they have been given permission to go. Later it is
their privilege to read of the trial and express dis
approbation of the verdict, to rail against the jury
system, opining loudly that it is a failure. So, to a
certain extent, thanks largely to them, it is.
In minor cases it is rare that representative citizens
are selected as jurymen. Apparently they are not so
much as expected to serve, for they are not sum
moned, and the panel is made up of the courtroom
loafer, the professional juror, the ragtag and bobtail
of the city, lacking in intelligence, principle and
standing. If the method of trial by jury is to con
tinue, the time has come for a decided reform. Re
spectable citizens should be chosen, and. having been
chosen, forced to act. The service rendered by an
honest juryman is honorable, far more honorable than
his efforts to sneak out of it.
DISSATISFIED SCHOOL DIRECTORS.
DIRECTORS Gallagher and Waller of the
Board of Education are said to be not satisfied
with the report of the Grand Jury. Possibly
the object of formulating a report is not the satisfy
ing of every rascal whom the report may adversely
criticize. That the management of the board has
been shameful there is no denying. That some of the
members belong behind the bars is the common be
lief. They have wasted the funds placed at their dis
posal, have unbiushingly defied the public to do any
thing about it, and now have the unspeakable assur
ance to resent the mention of their dereliction by a
body organized for the avowed purpose of bringing
lawbreakers to justice.
There could not well be better recommendation for
the Grand Jury than the displeasure of Gallagher and
Waller. This might be strengthened by a yelp from
Ragan, and Drucker could add to its weight by ex
pressing disregard for the attitude of the jury. The
fact stands out that the course of the Board of Edu
cation has been from the first against all decency,
and that if it has not been wantonly dishonest it em
braces a number of fools. At least, it has been a re
proach and a disgrace to the community. The more
its leading spirits protest, the more they emphasize
the certainty that the people were led into electing to
important office a lot of incompetent and conscience
less knaves.
MURDER fiND INCENDIARISM.
THERE is one method by which the crime of
arson can be checked, and this is the simple one
of punishing it. There is no misdeed in the
whole list more unpardonable, because it must of ne
cessity be deliberate.
When the setting fire to a building results in finan
cial loss to innocent parties, the guilty wretch should
be held responsible, and if unable to pay, be kept in
confinement until the sum had been worked out at
a credit of perhaps a dollar a day. This might mean
a life sentence, and so much the better. If the crime
involves the destruction of life, it should be treated
is murder of the first degree.
The people of one California town are now search
ing for an incendiary, and. catching him, he will be
hanged. He ought to be. It is a pity the law does
not prescribe this course, and the way to educate the
law-maker is to give him a few object lessons.
Surely the man who applies the torch to a structure
in which people are sleeping is deserving of no more
consideration than the one who wrecks a train, and,
according to the code, the wrecker is a murderer, fit
for the gallows.
For refusal to give alms to an impertinent beggar a
citizen of Los Angeles was recently stabbed. The
problem of what to do with our beggars has long
been a puzzle, but about the disposition of this par
ticular one there should be no difficulty while there
is jail-room.
Figel may congratulate himself, so far as the courts
are concerned, but as to his conscience there is per
haps a different aspect.
THE PRESIDENT OND FINANCE.
THE friends of the single standard and sup
porters of financial and currency reform have
occasion to be pleased by the President's atti
tude toward these most necessary policies.
In the message he says: "The importance of ade
quate provision which will insure to our future a
money standard related as our money standard now
is to that of our commercial rivals is generally recog
nized.
"The companion proposition that our domestic
paper currency shall be kept safe and yet be so related
to the needs of our industries and internal com
merce as to be adequate and responsive to such needs
is a proposition scarcely less important."
These declarations cover the conclusions reached
by the Indianapolis money conference, as formulated
in the bills which are already referred to the House
Committee on Banking and Currency.
Of course it is known that those bills cannot pass
the Senate, as at present constituted, for in that body
the sound money men are in a minority. But the
next Senate, which goes into power on the 4th of
March, 1899, will have a good working majority of
sound money men, as will the House which begins
at the same date.
If there be any change the need of this financial re
form is more pressing than ever. The country is ad
monished by the result of the recent elections. The
Republican party made its losses east of the Missis
sippi River, and its gains west of that line. Cali
fornia contributes two to the gains in the Senate
and six to the total majority in the House, or within
a fraction of one-half thereof.
The party has been renewed in its power for specific
reasons and well defined purposes, chief among which
are those related to the standard of value and the
currency reform, to which the President refers.
As it is not expedient to attempt anything with the
present Senate, it is highly expedient and necessary
to bring the next Senate into action in co-ordination
with the friendly majority in the House at the earliest
possible day after the life of the next Congress begins.
Then will be the first opportunity presented, since the
financial agitation began, of a President and House
and Senate in accord upon the measures and method
of reform. An extra session should be held next
spring to dispose finally of this subject. Then, if by
some unforeseen accident the President and House
chosen in 1000 should desire to disturb that adjust
ment, the Senate would stand in the way and could
not be overridden.
It may be said, we believe, with confidence, that
the surest safeguard against such an accident will be
found in the enactment of financial and currency re
form next spring, thus demonstrating the fidelity and
good faith of the party in power and proving its right
to further confidence by having merited it.
ANOTHER WAR STAMP DECISION.
A DISPATCH from Lansing, Mich., brings the
intelligence that' the State Supreme Court of
that commonwealth has handed down a de
cision declaring that the express companies must pay
for the war stamps affixed to receipts issued to ship
pers. No particulars are given, but since the Ameri
can Express Company is mentioned as one of the
litigants, we may presume that the case is an appeal
from the decision of one of the Michigan Circuit
Courts, wherein it was held that a writ of mandate
would issue compelling the express companies to
stamp their receipts.
Up to the present time the express corporations, in
their selfish and unpatriotic contention with reference
to war taxation, have said that until some court of
last resort had decided against them they would con
tinue to believe their construction of the law to be
correct. Here, at last, is an opinion from a court of
final resort in a great State. What are these contu
macious tax-shirkers going to do now? Half a dozen
nisi prius courts have ruled against them to the one
for them, and the latter was an ill-considered "rush"
decision rendered for the purpose of furthering an
appeal. At last a Supreme Court has upheld the
former line of decisions and reaffirmed the opinions
of the United States Attorney General, Commissioner
of Internal Revenue and other officials who have ruled
on the question. We repeat, what are the express
companies, and especially Wells, Fargo & Co., going
to do?
If they do not now submit and pay their war taxes
we have a right to consider them in rebellion against
the Government and the law. They have refused to
support the nation in time of war, its greatest peril;
they have set the courts at defiance and openly
flaunted their arrogance; they have stamped the re
ceipts of their big patrons and robbed their small and
helpless ones; in short, they have been guilty of con
duct which, were it proved against an individual,
would render him liable to punishment as a traitor
and a criminal. Are these express monopolies going
to be allowed to continue in this manner until the
end?
The attention of Congress ought to be called to the
matter by the Boards of Trade and Chambers of Com
merce of the country. Something more than a clari
fication of the law should be undertaken. The ex
press companies should be brought under Govern
ment supervision and made to feel that they owe at
least obedience to the law. There is but one way to
reach the hearts of the selfish and unpatriotic con
cerns, and that is through their pockets. If the law
i? amended it should enact that intercommercial ex
press rates shall not be increased beyond the figures
now prevailing, and that the war stamp tax shall be
quadrupled. This might make the traitorous cor
porations sing a different tune.
It is pleasing to learn that the Examiner's national
policy is the guide of the administration. The enter
prising Hearst not only made the war, but has dic
tated the terms of settlement with Spain. However,
the administration has been too busy to set forth
these facts, and the Examiner has modestly saved it
the trouble.
Miss Ball is to be congratulated upon having de
feated the Board of Education. The merits of her
contention are not widely known, but anybody en
gaged in controversy with the board is certain to be
right.
Baldwin is not particularly beloved now, but if he
cover his property with a two-story row of cheap
stores, he will be pained and surprised to realize that
he has not reached the zenith of unpopularity.
The tugboat style of marriage seems to have been
revived. Nevertheless, an opinion prevails that a
wedding which would be illegal ashore is nothing to
brag of when performed at sea.
Chinese exclusion laws are said to be in effect in
Hawaii. By way of preventing the Chinese any un
necessary distress, it may be added that the same laws
arc said to be in effect here.
When a day passes without fresh revelation of
crookedness somewhere in the City Hall, that day is
apt to be Sunday.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1898.
OX two continents Karl Becker is known as
"The Prince of Forgers." Well he earned the
title. His adroitness and his facile pen have
for years been the terror of bankers. Becker is in
jail in this city, his latest crime confessed. What
next?
On his first trial Becker, together with an associate,
was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for
life. The trial took place before Judge Wallace, a
jurist noted for unswerving severity. Many a footpad
has Wallace sent across the bay to end his years in
stripes. Many a man, impelled by want to some deed
of violence, has trembled before Wallace at the words
dooming him to confinement for twenty, thirty or
forty years. So it was not surprising that Becker was
sentenced for life.
Neither was it surprising that the prisoner should
have been given a new trial. Such is the way that
justice is expedited. On the second trial there was
still no shadow of doubt as to the guilt of Becker,
but there was a disagreement. It is not to the pur
pose now to discuss the status of the jury. Before a
third trial could be brought about the associate of
Becker, a man equally culpable with him, deserted
the forger and agreed to testify against his old pal.
To this despicable treachery he was purchased by the
offer of leniency. Who had a right to offer it?
Becker saw that his case was hopeless. For three
years he had been in the County Jail. While there
was no prospect that he would be again convicted,
there stretched out ahead the possibility of a long
series of trials, more years of waiting, an intermin
able fight against justice. He determined to sur
render. At this point came the revelation of the utter
inadequacy of Chief Lees. In his anxiety to be able
to say that he had the Prince of Forgers behind the
bars, Lees promised him immunity, as he had prom
ised it to the thieving accomplices. To be sore,
Becker was to be punished, but he was to dictate the
terms. He was willing to accept a sentence of seven
years, with credit for the time he had kept the baffled
courts and the helpless police struggling to give him
his dues. He pleaded guilty, his plea being accom
panied by a statement from his own lawyers, the
State's lawyers and the Bankers' Association, that
this would be satisfactory. Or, in other words, Lees
tried the man, passed the sentence, got the bankers
to approve, and then asked Judge Wallace to enact
the formality of legalizing the findings. Such unex
ampled impudence deserves the full weight of any re
buke Judge Wallace can administer. Is he to permit
a Chief of Police, anxious for a scalp, and a lot of
bankers, to override him and pre-empt his preroga
tives? We do not believe the Judge so weak a man.
We think he esteems the dignity of his position too
highly to have it thus made an adjunct to a stupid
and unlawful police scheme. He has heard Becker's
confession of guilt. He is in no manner bound to
weigh extraneous conditions imposed by Lees. If
Becker deserved a life sentence before â and this no
body questions â he deserves it now.
The bankers agree that after the expiration of the
trifling term they have decided upon for Becker they
will give the old man a pension, not as a reward of
merit, but as an inducement to be honest. They want
the law to touch him lightly, so they may buy him to
be honest.
The entire scheme is rotten. It shows above all
things the incompetency of Lees. He may make a
bargain with crime, but when he calls upon a court
to ratify it he insults not alone the court, but the peo
ple. Becker says that he is guilty, as charged. In at
tempting to shield him Lees is derelict to his duty.
He has met the more astute Becker and the stronger
intelligence won. Society wants protection against
Beckers. It does not even desire that when caught
they shall instruct the courts what to do with them.
We hope and believe that Judge Wallace will over
rule the firm of Lees & Becker.
rOR a long time the American people have
looked in vain to Congress for protective legis
lation favorable to the upbuilding of the mer
chant marine needed to carry on our commerce. The
Republican party, so faithful in the performance of its
general pledges, has been strangely neglectful of its
pledge in this regard. Our ship-builders and ship
owners are still struggling in vain to compete with
the subsidized shipping of Europe, and our imports
and exports are still mainly carried in foreign vessels,
at the expense to us of a heavy annual tribute to the
foreign owners.
Now, at last, there is a fair prospect that justice will
be done, and that speedily. The expansion of our
merchant marine has become urgent. The events and
the results of the war have combined to make clear
the imperative necessity of legislation that will stimu-
Inte the building of American ships to be manned by
American sailors to carry American produce to all
parts of the world and to bring back to our shores the
goods we import in exchange for them.
The President set forth the urgency of the matter
very clearly in his message. "The annexation of Ha
waii," he said, "and the changed relations of the
United States to Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philip
pines, resulting from the war, compel the prompt
adoption of a maritime policy by frequent steamship
communication encouraged by the United States un
der the American flag with the newly acquired islands.
Spain furnished to its colonies, at an annual cost of
about two million dollars, steamship lines communi
cating with a portion of the world's markets, as well
as with trade centers of the home Government. The
United States will not undertake to do less. It is our
duty to furnish the people of Hawaii with facilities
under national control for their export and import
trade. It will be conceded that the present situation
calls for legislation which shall be prompt, durable
and liberal."
Furthermore, the President added: "The part which
the American merchant vessels and their seamen per
formed in the war with Spain demonstrates that this
service, furnishing both pickets and the second line
of defense, is a national necessity and should be en
couraged in every constitutional way."
Short as the present session will be, the country
has a right to expect of Congress a good and effec
tive shipping law before it closes. The issue is
broader than that of supplying the Philippines and
the West Indian Islands with merchant lines. It is
one of supplying the United States with such lines.
Our commerce is expanding in every direction. Our
tribute to foreign ship-owners is increasing annually.
Every argument which can be justly drawn from the
conditions of the present or the prospects of the fu
ture tends to strengthen the demand that the Govern
ment adopt at once a policy of fair play toward the
American merchant marine.
Mrs. Mentel is -said to have suffered a considerable
shock upon discovering that she was a murderess.
Precisely what effect she thought the impulsion of
two bullets into the body of her husband would pro
duce is a matter thus thrown into the field of specu
lation.
It may truly be said of the Earl who has wedded the

Laughter, Fleers and Jeers.
BURNS A POLITICAL JOKE.
(Los Angeles Herald).
Colonel Burns is only a political joke when considered as a Senator, and
the anti-poolroom and racetrack influence is enough to prevent a sport
from getting the place. The men who are even indirectly responsible for
the Widbers and McGlades are not the men who can go to the Federal Sen
ate. Mr. Grant has been lost in Washington or any old place in the East,
where he thought he could get the influence of a friend of his father's on the
California Legislature, which, he naively imagined, could be made to vote
as some Eastern Senator wished. General Barnes is still a possibility, and
so are two or three others, but to-day the only man who even approaches
probability of success is Mr. Bulla. To-morrow it may all be different, for if
new material of the right sort springs up a new arrangement of the votes
can be figured on.
WILL DAMN THEMSELVES.
(Los Angeles Times).
If there is any legislator in this State who wish*"- '* forever damn him
self politically, socially and morally let him go to Sacramento next month
and vote to send D. M. Burns to the United States Senate, and the job will
be done with neatness and dispatch. According to the San Francisco cor
respondence of the Oakland Tribune "A thorough canvass of the State is
being made in his (Burns') behalf, and if he is satisfied that he has enough
. votes to secure him the victory there is no doubt he will go out for it."
Sure! He would certainly be several kinds of an ass if he did not go for the
Senatorship were he certain o f success. But there's the rub. Dan Burns
has no more show to get the votes of the reputable and honest Assembly
men and Senators from the interior than he has to have his character as
an ex-official of the State restored to him by that same Legislature which
Is to elect a United States Senator.
A GOOD WAY TO KILL HIM.
(Treka Journal.)
Dan Burns is mentioned as a possible candidate for United States Sena
tor, but we don't believe he will be "in it." The Republicans have plenty of
better timber to pick from in getting a first-class man for that important
position. Possibly Burns' name has been mentioned as a good way to kill
him politically as a leader or boss. The Republican voters are not favorable
to him by any means, a fact that members of the Legislature can easily dis
cover by asking the question.
AN OBJECTIONABLE CREATURE.
(The Californian.)
The report has obtained currency that Colonel Dan M. Burns Is in the
fight for Federal Senator as the candidate of the Southern Pacific of Ken
tucky. To little purpose had the Republican party captured the Legislature
if it were to be dedicated to purposes so vile as the election to the United
State Senate of thU man Burns, a creature not only objectionable because
of his own past record but additionally offensive because the protege of the
railroad. The brazen impudence of the railroad in California
politics should no longer be tolerated and any man known
to be its candidate should always be overwhelmingly beaten,
whether the office of his aspirations be great or small. In the degradation of
politics and corruption of men in high place no other agency in California
has wielded an influence so potent and malign. To gain its ends it has hesi
tated, apparently, at nothing. It has dominated California politics with the
insolence of a czar and in total disregard of the rights of the people has
kept its transportation rates at a Doint so high that it might not inap
propriately be designated the limit of human forbearance. Time was when
California, bound hand and foot and completely at the mercy of the Octopus,
had its president in the United States Senate; but we have got beyond that.
We entertain slight fear that Burns, even with the great power of the
Southern Pacific behind him. will come dangerously near to election. Even De
Young would prove less obpectionable than he. But there are in the Sen
atorial contest, truth to say. too many men able to call their souls their
own to permit to become formidable the candidacy of either of the two
named. California needs in the United States Senate a mart of character and
standing and ability, a statesman and a speaker. Does Dan Burns possess
character or standing or ability? Is he an orator or a statesman? Is not
his record as a State official such as to render the mere suggestion of his
candidacy an Insult? While the people of California do not hold their
Legislatures to so strict an account as they should, nevertheless the man
who at Sacramento would vote for Dan Burns for United States Senator
must be a creature from the slums of San Francisco.

MICROBES IN MILK.
It will be readily granted that the In
spection of milk and its sources of supply
Is of even more importance from a public
health point of view than the inspection
of meat, since milk is so largely used as
the food of Infants.
Milk, immediately it is taken from the
healthy cow, contains no microbes.
Hardly has the milk settled in the pail
than they abound, so many as 10,000 in
one-quarter cubic inch having been de
tected. The question which naturally
presents itself is, "Where do they come
from?" From the silled teats, from the
soiled hands of the workers, from the at
mosphere of the milking shed and from
the palls themselves. They possess the
property of propagating very rapidly.
Monsieur de Freudeurich of the Berne
Laboratory asserts that milk Just drawn
containing in one-quarter cubic inch 9000
microbes, seven hours later was found to
contain 60,000. After a period of twenty
five hours had elapsed 5,000,000 microbes
were present in the same quantity of
milk; and if the temperature be raised to
95 degrees Fahrenheit the microbic popu
lation of the same milk, during the same
time, would reach the enormous total of
812.500,000!
Children appear particularly prone to
contract consumption through the agency
of milk containing tubercle bacilli.â

STBEAK OF BAD LUCK.
His Salary Was Cut Down and
He May Be Obliged to

Living.
Colonel "Billy" Hamilton Is In a streak
of bad luck. The star of Dan Burns
seems to have cast a hoodoo upon him,
even the proximity of a "cullud pusson"
has not been able to save him.
It was only a few days ago that the col
onel sent on to Washington a memorial
recommending Burns for the position of
Naval Officer which he hoped that Colo
nel John P. Irish would vacate by the 15th
of the present month. But the petition
ran up against a waste basket in the
White House and, Colonel Irish, a gold
Democrat, will vacate nothing. Then
came the announcement from Washing
ton that President McKinley intended to
keep Colonel Irish in office until after the
inauguration of the next President at
least. This was quite enough, but the
cruel blow was followed by another a few
days later when Colonel Jackson notified
him that on the first of the present
month his mascot, A. D. Jones, the col
ored gent who hefts Custom House cash
for Colonel Hamilton, would be relieved
from duty, because the appropriation of
$30,000 allowed Colonel Jackson for emer
gencies in his capacity of Collector could
no longer stand the strain. As Colonel
Hamilton was pretty busy in the Dan
Burns fight for the Senatorshlp he could
not afford to be confined to his office in
the Custom House, and he embraced the
alternative of paying the salary of Mr.
Jones out of his own pocket for the pres
ent month and possibly until after the
conclusion of the Senatorial contest in the
coming session of the Legislature.
That is why there is a streak of sadness
in the perennial smile of the cashier, and
that Is why there is such a wistful look
in his eye.
When he took the office the annual sal
ary was $3000. but on the recommendation
of Major Moore, an inferior in military
rank, the salary was cut to $2500, the
major hefting the value of his services at
that amount.
Another story of the reduction
has been going the rounds, but
it is without doubt unfounded in
fact, Collector Jackson being too good
a friend of Colonel Hamilton to do any
thing of the kind. The story is that the
Collector backed the cashier for the po
sition of Naval Officer in order that a
vacancy might thus be created in the
cashiership which the Collector could fill
with one of the many patriots who are
making him walk the floor at night study
ing and worrying because he can't give
them all a job. Then when the jig was up
that he took away the cashier's darkey
so as to compel the cashier to work
and thus disgust him with the position
and make him resign, and create a va
cancy anyhow. But the proof that this
story is not true lies in the fact that the
prunnlng knife has been applied to other
departments as well. For instance, his
good friend. Internal Revenue Collector
John C. Lynch, who is not a colonel and
never rose higher than fifth sergeant, was
obliged to discharge three of his clerks
in order that his emergency expenses
might not exceed his pro rata of the $30.
000 appropriation. The clerks discharged
on the Ist of the month were P. T. M.
Waite and D. D. Sohindler. who have
been working for several months on an
index to the duplicate Chinese registra
tion in his office. W. W. Colm was the
third victim of the economical change.
Auditor Cope mourns a recent cut from
$3500 to $3000. while the salary t>f the ad
juster was increased from $2500 to $3000.
That is why "Billy" Hamilton does not
smile so profusely as before, and why the
air of the Custom House is so chilly
notwithstanding the hot time in Major
Moore's office.

The steam whaler Alexander, the last
of the fleet, got in from the Arctic yes
terday. She left here on March 31 last,
and comes back clean, so the crew will
have no money to buy Christmas presents
this year. Captain Tilton reports that on
October 30 the Norwegian steamer Bow
tiead salted from Plover Bay, Siberia, for
Yokohama. One of her crew fell from
aloft, but was not killed, and another
broke his leg while cutting up a whale.
IMPRISONED IN FIFTY MILES OF ICE,
The steam-whaler Alexander had. a hard luck season this year.
Just when the very best whaling was going on she was caught in an ice
field and held prisoner from May 1 to June 20. She was again caught in
the ice in Plover Bay, on the Siberian coast, and very nearly had to
spend the winter there. As it was, she lost two anchors while making
her escape.
The Alexander put into Dutch Harbor
after leaving Plover Bay, and sailed from
there on November 8 for San Francisco.
A heavy gale was encountered, so the
bnrk returned to her anchorage and dirt
rot make another start until November 23.
At Dutch Harbor the Alaska Commercial
Company was extending its wharf when
the Alexander left. The schooner Pearl
was fitting out for San Francisco and was
to sail via I'nga about December 1.
Ah sorts of stories came from the Arctic
about the Alexander. She was reported
with Fix whales, ashore at Cape Nava
rine, wrecked, and, last of all, with four
whales. The facts of the case are that
she was caught in the ice at Cape Nava
rine, and the only whalebone secured by
the crew was what they got from the
natives in trade. The Alexander was in
the ice off Capo Navarine from May 1 to
June 2<j. She was making her way
through an ice field, when it closed in on
her, and there she had to stay. The field
extended for fifty miles, and every day
tb'_> crew could see the Ice curl up in dif
f rent directions when a jam came.
Luckily, no jam came in the vicinity of
the Alexander, so she escaped being badly
nipped. After getting out of the ice there
â u.i.s not a whale to be found, so Captain
Tilton went tradng on the Siberian coast.
there hard luck and the ice followed
her, and she was nearly frozen in in
Plover Hay. At Dutch Harbor John
Blai k of the crew deserted.

were more songs and short addresses by

all wound up with ice cream and cake.

TRANSGRESSED LAWS.
Billy Berg Appeals to the Officers of
the Tamalpais Sportsmen's
Club for Damages.
A special meeting of the directors of
the Tamalpals Sportsmen's Club will be
held on Sunday next to hear certain
charges which have been entered by Billy
Berg against John Bergez and Werner
Stalif. The complaint reads:
To the Honorable Otto Muser. President
Tamalpais Sportsmen's Clubâ Dear Sir: In ac
cordance with the laws which govern our club
I consider that I am entitled to damages
.imountinÃ to a dinner for five persons or its
equivalent, viz., JICO. By a reference to our
by-laws you will see on page 5 of the big game
book that Metlon 8 reads thusly; "Any member
who designedly or otherwise disappoints a
brother member when an engagement is made
â¢ â¢ .ii'P^ar at headquarters on a certain day
or time for any particular purpose, thereby
;;u:-ing the disappointed member a monetary
loss or a loss* of appetite occasioned by de
â¢i feelings, etc., will be fined In accord
ance with the facts eiiclted the sum of $100
which money in accordance with the president's
wishes ehall be expended in a dinner for five
club members to be selected by the president "
etc.
The story goes that last Sunday Billy
. 5 t^ fter navin c a verbal understanding
with Messrs Berges and Stauf that they
shoul'i nn-et him at the game lodge near
Manzanita at 2 p. m., hastened in the ear
ly hours of morning from Sausalito to
the happy hunting grounds. He engaged
a spanking fine team in Sausalito, and in
the conveyance there were stowed safely
away several bottles of choice wines and
edibles of a kind which only those in afflu
ent circumstances can afford to taste.
Arriving at the lodge, Mr. Berg informed
the gamekeepers and the royal chef tnat
two of his most intimate friends would
be over in good season for an afternoon
dinner. Consequently a few brace of
mountain ritiespants, blackcock and wood
cock, fresh from the bush, were
brought into camp by the head gillie.
Time flew by fast as the most entertain
ing narratives of the chase were related
by the keepers much to the enjoyment of
Mr. Berg and his rapidly accumulating
appetite.
When the clock in the royal shack
struck 2 and not a single representative
of the high class shooting squad was in
sight, Mr. Berg waxed angry; but he
hoped for better results. At 3 o'clock he
mounted a keeper's charger and rode to
the highest peak, and there scanned over
miles of unbroken sod, but no Bergez and
no Stauf could be discernedâ not even
through the club's powerful telescope,
which is guaranteed to land an object of
any reasonable size at from fifty to a
hundred miles distant on a clear day.
When the clock struck 4 Mr. Berg de
parted for home, leaving a magnificent
appetite and the delicacies of the season
The keepers enjoyed the feast of their
live? as the champion deer slayer nf the
club gave all to them. Ever since Sunday
Mr Berg has been using divers kinds of
language, but he prays for damages in
plain English, and doubtless the meeting
of club officers and legal advisers, winch
la to be held on Sunday, will be the
warmest that has ever taken place on the
grandest inland game preserve west of
the Rocky Mountains.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1898.
CHESTNUT AND
HIS TORPEDOES
They Wreak Havoc in a Natoma-Street
Lodging House â Mrs. Hansen
Badly Injured.
A LITTLE, ricketty, two-story lodging house at 255 Natoma street was
the scene of an explosion yesterday afternoon, which completely
wrecked the building and for a time created the wildest excitement
in the neighborhood. As yet It is unexplained, but the Fire Mar
shal will make a rigid Investigation.
The room in which the explosion occurred was occupied by J. N.
Chestnut, an erratic, misplaced genius of the Colonel Mulberry Sellers'
type, who is always on the verge of making a discovery "with millions In
It," and he is the only immediate sufferer from the explosion. He took
the room about three weeks ago and immediately began manufacturing
toy torpodoes, which he supplied to the small boys in the neighborhood.
The torpedoes were successful to such a degree that the police finally or
dered him to quit making them and he started to find a market for them
outside the city. At about half-past 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon the
neighborhood was Btartled by a deafening explosion which shook every
building in the block. Plaster came rattling down to the accompaniment
of the clink of breaking glass and the creaking of timbers. Women and
children rushed screaming Into the narrow street, and a dense cloud of
smoke was seen to arise from the rear of 255. Mrs. Hanson, who was ly
ing sick in her room at 257, was thrown out of bed and the shock to her
nervous system is so great that it is probable she will not recover. An
alarm of fire was at once turned in, but when the firemen arrived they
found that there was no blazeâ nothing but smoke and wreckage and an
old man washing blood from his face and hands.
It would be hard to inrngine a room more completely demolished than
the one in which the explosion took place. There was not a whole stick
of furniture nor an unbroken pane of glass in the room- Chestnut, cov
ered with blood and trembling with fright, was taken to a free clinic in
the neighborhood. The skin was torn from his face and hands and one
eye was missing. He went away after his wounds were dressed and has
not been seen since.
The owner of the house tried to throw an air of mystery about the
whole thing. He declined to make any statement or any explanation.
Judging from appearances the explosion took place in the bureau in
Chestnuts room, but he claims that he had prepared a box for shipment,
but thinking it unsafe, started to open it with a hammer and chisel. As
a natural result the first blow of the hammer caused sufficient concussion
to explode the contents.

awarded to the V'al. Blatz Brewing Com
pany on its products by the Trans-Missis
sippi and International Exposition at Oma
ha, which has recently been brought to a
successful conclusion. The gold medals
were awarded to the Val. Blatz export
beer and to the Val. Blatz Malt-Vivine
for quality, in competition with the world,
and the silver medal was awarded on the
general display of products made by the
company at the exposition. The managers
of the brewing company are much elated
over the awards, as they have a right to
be for their products were not only
brought into direct competition with the
leading brewing companies of this, but
with those of many of the countries of
the old world.
The Blatz Brewing Company has passed
the half-century line since it was organ
ized and is now one of the leading brew
ing plants of the United States. Arrange
ments are being made at the present time
to enlarge the plant materially next sum

MABEL TREADWELL'S FUNDS.
Now the Subject of Litigation in
Judge Troutt's vourt.
The action of Calvin P. Summers
against the California Savings and Loan
Society to recover a judgment of $14,000
was opened before Judge Troutt and a
jury yesterday morning. The plaintiff al
leges' that in 1592 Mrs. Mabel Treadwell
deposited the money in the bank and sub
sequently assigned it to him. The bank
denies that Mrs. Treadwell ever assigned
the -money, on information and belief,
while H. C. Summers. Joseph Nolan and
Maud Nolan, who are joined as defend
ants aver that they have an interest in
the deposit, and pray that the plaintiff
take nothing by his action.

ningham Gehrlcke deciding an important
point in that case. Defendant entered into a
contract to purchase certain shares of the
plaintiff corporation for the sum of Â£750
a share. On October 1, 1897, the defendant
was caJled upon to pay the money,
amounting to $11,381 50. He refused to
pay and attachment proceedings were in
stituted. On the motion to dissolve the
injunction it was contended by the â de
fendant that the value of a pound ster
ling had been fixed by Congress at $4 86,
and upon that estimate he owed less than
was demanded. Judge Belcher refused to
sustain the contention, holding that the
valuation established by act of Congress
applies only to customs revenues of the
I nited State? and has no bearing on com
mercial transactions, which must be sub
ject to the ordinary fluctuations of or
dinary commercial exchange.
ALICE BEACH McCOMAS.
The Gifted Musician to Be Heard in
This City.
The piano recital to be given by Miss
Alice Beach McComas next Monday even
ing at the Century Hall on Sutter street
promises the music-loving public of the
city at least one more individual exhibi
tion of genius before the close of the
present year. During the past year mu
sical prodigies innumerable have been in
troduced for judgment before the critics,
but most of these have been found to
simplj^ possess a partially developed tal
ent. In Miss McComas, however, will be
found a true perfection in her art which
comes from long and indefatigable study,
aided by natural genius.
Her repertoire has almost no limit. She
can interpret the intricate and complex
compositions of Mendelssohn, Schubert
Mozart, and, in short, all the great com
posers with the greatest facility, accent
ing fully and perfectly with an inimitable
ease the compositions rendered.
Among her patrons in this city are-
Mayor Phelan. Irving Scott, Marco Hell
man, David Lubln, Henry N. Clement.
Mrs. William H. Mills, Mrs. Lovell
x- I , t , e \Â« Mrs - Fran * Sullivan. Mrs. James
Neall Mrs. Marrlner Campbell, and a host
01 t other prominent men and women
Â«. p^ sl J, ile on the ev enln& of the recital
Miss McComas will introduce before the
public one of her most promising pupils,
iharles A. Rossler, a deaf musician, well
known in Chicago and. in fact, generally
throughout the Eastern States, but more
particularly | n this city. This marvel of
musical ability sprang into prominence
more from his absolute deafness which
prevents him from distinguishing the
slightest sound, than through his other
wise extraordinary cleverness. Mr. Ros
sier was at one time a prominent figure
in both business and social circles of this
city. He was a member of many of the
most prominent glee clubs where, not
withstanding his affliction, he particular
ly shone aa a musician, wit and what the
world calls a "good josher "
The coming recital by Miss McComas
promises to be both an interesting and
enjoyable entertainment.

BRODERICK
PULLS THE LAW
ON DIRECTORS
Has Taken Up the
Fight of Teachers.
MORE CLAIMS HELD UP
PEDAGOGUES MUST GET NOVEM
BER PAY.
Until Salary Bills Are Adjudicated
Favored Merchants Must
Wait for Their
Money.
In Auditor Broderlck the teachers have
found a strong armed champion, and he
has taken Up the fight for their rights
against the School Directors with a wea
pon furnished him by the School Board
itself.
When the board cut off the November
pay of the teachers at its meeting a week
ago it expected no more opposition than
a general kick. There were claims from
local merchants aggregating nearly
$75,000 for necessary and unnecessary sup
plies decorating every pigeon-hole in Sec
retary Welch's office. The merchants
not only had votes, but recourse for their
claims to the bondsmen of the Directors.
The teachers had neither. Of a conse
quence the teachers suffered, and $15,000
of supply claims were audited and sent
downstairs to Auditor Broderick. At the
same time the salaries of office and shop
employes, amounting to $1450. were
signed and sent to the same official.
The teachers held the expected indigna
tion meeting, passed fitting resolutions,
waxed warm in the neckwear and de
cided to resort to mandamus proceedings
to compel the payment of their Christ-
mas money.
The litigation threatened by the teach
ers gave the Auditor his opportunity and
he has held up and refused to audit the
$15,000 in supply claims and the $1450 of
office and shop salaries until such time as
the teachers' claims snail have been ad
judicated.
Though Auditor Broderick has been con
fined to a sick bed for several weeks past
he has kept in close touch with affairs at
the hall, and has been well represented
at his office by his chief deputy, Dan
Leary- Both are convinced that they
have the law with them in their present
action, and they propose to hold tha
claims of the favored ones of the Direct
ors until the board has been forced to
acknowledge the rights of the pedagogues
or the courts have brought to bear some
force stronger than moral suasion.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW York, Dec 7.â The stock market was
strong throughout, except for the slight easing
off about midday, but toward the close de
veloped ajrjrres.Â«i.-e strength and lert off at gen
erally higher prices. At the opening there
wbf sympathetic strength â with London, where
American? were the feature, notably Norfolk
and Western preferred, which was largely
purchased on intimations that the dividend
rate might be increased.
Norfolk and Western preferred was conspicu
ous also In the local dealings both in activity
and strength on the company's supposed divi
dend prospect. There seemed to be but little
floating supply of this stock for the time be-
InK. and prices advanced 2%. On moderate pur
chases by London and commission houses,
standard stocks and the internationals were
firm the greater part of the day and advanced
with the rest of the list toward the close.
The high-priced specialties, including Tobacco,
Sugar and People's Gas, showed a decided up
ward tendency. Metropolitan Street Railway
was erratic but gained fractionally. The Paci
fies were less prominent than of late. Cleve
land, Columbus, Cincinnati aud Bt. Louis, re
flecting Increased earnings, advanced moder
ately.
The bond market presented many new feat
ures of interest to-day. Norfolk and Western
consols fours loomed to the front with an Im-
Jirovement of 2 points on exceptionally heavy
trading. Speculation generally was quite

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7â Wheat opened weak at a
decline of N,c for May and December, the
former starting at K%9Vttc and the latter at
645 ! 564'4c. Liverpool was the factor. That i
market reported declines that were entirely i
unlooked for by local traders, prices being -"SÂ® j
Id oft at about the time business commenced j
here. There was a little buying against puts !
immediately after the opening which caused a |
temporary reaction in May, but selling soon |
became too heavy and the price again declined.
The feature of the morning's trading was the
liquidation in December, which was much more
general than yesterday and which resulted in
a widening of the discount from l@l%c under
May. Commission houses were active sellers.
It is expected that after the close of naviga
tion, now at hand, December deliveries will be
freer and this undoubtedly influenced the
traders. About 11 o'clock the market became
steadier on reports of heavy clearances and a
good cash and export demand and prices slowly
recovered. Late in the session the market was
really strong, advances in coarse grains help
ing. Shorts covered quite freely and liquida
tion of December stopped. May closed 65% c
and December 64%@64Uc.
Corn was relatively much stronger than
wheat. The market opened lower, but soon re
covered and late in the day was very firm.
Leading bulls were good buyers. May closed
%& I >ic lower at 34Hc.
Oats were weak early in sympathy with corn,
but remained firm when corn advanced. Prom
inent bulls who wÂ«"-o liquidating yesterday were
buyers to-day. May gained hi r a\r.
Considering the heavy hog receipts, provisions
were remarkably steady. There was some
weakness at first, but good general buying
caused prices to advance, and the market was
well supported for most of the session. Under
the weight of the hog receipts, however, prices
declined sharply. At the close May pork was
7%c lower. May lard a shade lower and May
ribs 2%c lower.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Dec. 7.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the wool
market:
The sales of the past week Indicate the vol
ume of business In progress is fully up to
the average of this market in normal periods.
An encouraging feature Is that it Is not made
up of a few large purchases by the prominent
mills. The buying has become more genecal
and the smaller markets have been more of
a factor, and the business of the week has
been more evenly distributed.
This being the closing month of the year,
when manufacturers and others will be busily
occupied in taking account of stock, the vol
ume of business In progress is fully up to ex
f>ectations. If the heavyweight season startÃ
n well, a greater demand for wool is looked
for, which it is expected will at least keep
the market steady at current.
The sales of the week In Ooston amount to
2.R06.000 pounds domestic and 731,900 pounds for
eign, making a tntal of 8.357,000. against a total
of 3,349.500 for the previous week, and a total
of 2,660.000 for the week last year.
Sales since January 1. IS9B, amount to 125,490,
510 pounds, against 353,354,600 pounds last year
at this time.

would have done to the gems would have

Thirty riggers, who were employed by
E. J. Baldwin to tear down the ruins of
the Baldwin Hotel, refused to perform
any more of the dangerous work because
Baldwin reduced their wages to $1 50 a
He )-,,ul been paying them $3 and
$2 r." since they have been working on the
tottering walls, and the men went on a
t-trike when he expressed his determina

quence will be that the unsightly struc
ture, or what is 1.-ft of it, will continue
to be an eyesore for some time to come,
altuOUgh Baldwin said he could get any
mimbei to do the work for $1 a
day. This . . rs say is not so. He
might got unskilled men, but from the
dangerous nature of the work it is highly
probable thai some of them would be
killed in its performance, as it requires
experienced riggers to <lo it properly. He
succeeded in getting a half dozen men at
$1 50 a day. but very little progress was
made, and the donkey engine used to pull
the wa..s down was stopped all the after
noon. The strike does not Include the
men who are digging in the ruins and re
moving the debris, as they are paid $2 a
day by storekeepers in the burned build
"The riggers who went out were very
much exercised at Baldwin's course and
Fay now that they will not return to work
even at the old wages unless the un
pkilled men are discharged. They have
all done rigging on the water front and
they do not care to take chances with in
experienced men. The foreman himself
the job is the toughest one he ever
undertook.

gained from the fact that one day last

Baldwin has at last come to a definite
conclusion as to what to do with the
property upon which the Baldwin Hotel
stood. He declares he has decided to
erect a two-story building on the site,
paying particular attention to the stores
along Market street and making them as
good and commodious as anything in the
city. The stores when finished will let
for the highest rent on Market street,
while the ones on Powell and Ellis streets
will bring in a great deal more than the
old hotel.
With modern built stores along the
: three fronts he thinks the income will be
sufficient to meet present obligations and
leave a handsome margin besides. The
second floor will be occupied just as soon
as built. In that way no portion of the
ground will be permitted to remain non
productive, except that small piece where
the theater building stood, and even this
will later be turned into rent-producing
property.
The expense of putting up the new
building will be very small, as everything
that can be utilized out of the hotel will
be made to aid in the construction of the
smaller building. A brick and iron front
with plate glass windows will be buiu,
while the old bricks from the ruins will
be made to serve as a rear wall.
Every door and window saved from the
conflagration will be used in fitting up
the second story of the new building, as
also all of thu posts, pillars, girders, etc.,
both of iron and wood, that can be util
ized.
With this building "Lucky" will con
tent himself until some purchaser comes
, along and offers him a price for the entire
lot Then he will sell; but in no case,
Baldwin, will he ever build another
hotel and theater on the lot.
En this l.< is positively determined, as
he said: "1 am now too far advanced In
years to undertake the erection of a build
ing such as I would like to see stand on
the old site that I loved so dearly. By
the erection of the Baldwin Hotel twenty
1 three years ago Marker str. â¢â¢â¢ assumed
; its present commercial importance. Were
it not for the erection of the hotel and
. theater on this block that (pointing to the
Parrott buiMing) would never have been
built. I consider the property on Mar
ket street where the hotel stood worth
fully $10,000 a front foot, and it will bring
these figures inside of a very short
period."
When Baldwin sells the Market street
property ho will at the same time dis
of all of his San Francisco holdings
and retire to one of his country resi
dences to enjoy the balance of his days
in peace. He is thoroughly disgusted with
his San Francisco notoriety, where, he
says he has been held up as one of the
blackest men on earth, while at the same
time he tried in every way to advance the
interests of the city by spending thou
sands of dollars in improving property.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1898.
IS MRS. MARCEAU
REALLY INSANE?
Fears Some One Is Trying to Gain Pos
session of Her Property.
FOR the past few days there have been whisperings that Mrs. Fen
nellâformerly the wife of the dashing photographer and tin eoldier,
Colonel iuarceauâ had completely lost her mind and would shortly be
removed to a sanitarium, where it was hoped she might woo back
health and reason.
Mrs. Fiske-Marceau-Fennell has been living at the Lick, and the wild
mutterings and shrieks that cleft the usual stillness of her rooms made
the guests at the Lick surmise all sorts of terrible things.
Then there was also the many daily visits of the doctor that lent
color to the story, until all suppositions became certainties, and it was
given out that the wealthy and beautiful widow of the Fresno million
aire and twice divorcee was about to be committed to a madhouse.
Dr. E. O. Jellinek, Mrs. Fennell's physician, is authority for the state
ment that the so-called mental aberration is nothing more nor less than
delirium, the direct result of high temperature brought on by disease.
"Mrs. Fennell has been suffering with an acute attack of appendicitis,"
paid the doctor, "and the resulting high temperature caused violent de
lirium. The noises that disturbed the guests at the hotel were the mutter
ings of delirium. Mrs. Fennell is now convalescent, and I hope that af
ter a short stay in the country she will be completely restored to health."
Dr. Jellinek admitted that he had heard the reported rumors of the
lady's insanity, and that even the reports had been brought to the lady
herself "The other day," sttA the doctor, "when I called on Mrs. Fen
nell I found her in tears and in a highly nervous state. She begged me
to tell her if she really was insane, and said some of her friends had
told her that there was the report a man closely associated with her in
business matters had circulated. After she was quieted she said there
was a plot afoot to railroad her to an asylum so the man in question might
legally take charge of the management of her estate."
Acting according to the advice of her physician, who claims that abso
lute quiet is necessary for the patient's recovery, Mrs. Fennell denies
herself to all visitors. She goes out driving, seeks distraction at the the
ater but absolutely refuses to see any visitors.
Mr Munson, an old and tried retainer of the Marceau household, came
in answer to the reporter's card and said his mistress, whom he still
calls Mrs Marceau, could not receive any one. Munson denied emphatically
that his mistress was suffering with temporary aberration, and referred
the scribe to the attending physician. *
In the office of the Lick the clerk in charge said he knew nothing
and had heard nothing of Mrs. Marceau's being insane, although the bell
boy confessed to the fact that the lady was certainly "cranky."
Dr Jellinek, Mrs. Fennell's physician, is, according to his own testi
mony an expert on insanity. "She is perfectly sane," the doctor Baid,
"but I can't say what may develop. She comes from an extremely ner
vous family, and is herself highly excitable."

ever, refuse to believe that he has made
away with himself. His business affairs
were in a satisiactory condition and the
only motive for his suicide was his un
happy domestic relations.
Kammer lived with his wife on Bay
Farm Island. With them was a man
named Frederick A. Sutten, who claimed
at times to be Rammer's partner,, and
who, Mrs. Kammer has stated, was her
brother. Both assertions have been
denied. As soon as Rammer's probable '
suicide was reported to-day Sutten and
the woman called at police headquarters
and inquired how they should proceed to ;
collect Kammor's life insurance. Being |
unable to secure the desired information
they hastened to San Francisco, and dur
ing the day were absent from their home.
Kammer frequently spoke of suicide to
his friends, but as he was of. a jocular
disposition little attention was given his
remarks. He did not go home last night.
He visited the Hotel Encinal. on High
street, early in the evening, and as he wag
somewhat under the Inlluence of liquor
he was put to bed. He arose this mom
ing about 6:30 o'clock, told the barkeeper

JOSH REILLY
AND HIS MOST
SUPERB CATCH
The Newspapers Did
Not Praise It.
MISTAKE A DANGEROUS ONE
BEN CLASH EXPATIATES ON
COBNEE CUTTING.
He Says, and Truthfully So, That
Pitching for Corners Is an
Art Yet to Be Accom
plished.
By Joe Corbett.
"Josh" Reilly made what might with
propriety be termed a phenomenal cau j.
In last Sunday's game at Recreation Park.
Strange as it certainly is, the newspapers
said but little of the great catch, I my
self overlooking it entirely. In view of
this fact I take advantage of the
present opportunity to compliment "Josh"
on his clever play. At the time It oc
curred the bases were full, which adds
additional glory to the occasion. Some
folks might consider it a waste of time,
with a little energy cast in, to touch on so
significant a point. But folks should bear
in mind that when a player succeeds in
doing something out of the ordinary his
first act the following a. m. is to secure
the morning dailies and see what the
"roasting" reporters have to say. Should
they neglect, as in this case of Reilly's,
to make any mention of the fact, such
a mistake is considered sufficient cause
with some players to refrain from doing
such extraordinary things in the future.
It is to guard against this dreaded re
sult, intermingled, of course, with a de
sire not to ostracize Mr. Reilly from pub
lic notice, that I speak of this gentle
man's wonderful catch of Sunday last.
We are all sadly aware of the fact that
wonderful plays and catches are as
scarce in the vicinity of Recreation Park
as good games were but a few months
ago. In justice to those who do not pos
sess a season pass I Item it expedient to
encourage such playing. Very often it is
the only return they receive for their
money, and why spoil this outside Issue
for the sake of a few words? Not at all.
Reilly made one of the greatest catches
I ever saw, and if he performs the feat
again I'll pay him that $150 the Pacific
Coast League failed to make good as yet,
providing, of course, I am not disturbed
from these pleasant reveries, which, tor
some reason or other, I uave to indulge
in while expatiating on the ups and
downs of the national game. In conjunc
tion with the above little speech, 1 wish
to state that the patrons of ball games
the world over like to see such catches
as Mr. Reilly made last Sunday. This is
so particularly of our Paciiie Coast, fanat
ics and therefore it would ill become the
players to dispense with the best and in
Some caffs the only thing they do. Make
Kreat catcher, and then go into politics;
but get into politics just as soon as pos
sible after making the catch. You know
in baseball a man's popularity dies out
rather rapidly. Verily, I have seen a
player a hero on one evening, and a
"lobster"â if 1 may make use of the ex
pression â on the next.
Ben Clark, one of the catchers of the
Baltimore Club, has this to say of pitch
ers" "This talk about pitchers working
the' in and out side corners of the plate
makes very interesting reading for tho
baseball fans, but there Is more romance
than fact about it. If a batsman is weak
on a high ball the average pitcher has
enough control of the ball not to serve
a low one. But when it comes to the
hair-splitting skill that is required to
serve the sphere over the corners of the
plate there are few-precious fewâpitch
ers who can work such a scientific bit of
control. Clark Griffith of the Chicagos;
Bert Cunningham, Al Maul and Charley
Nichols may be successful in working the
corners occasionally, for their control of
the ball is simply phenomenal The
Ditcher who takes the mask and the pad
of a backstop for a guide and succeeds in
sending the ball so that it will round up
opposite the wind pad is doing good work,
especially if he can ram his curves over.
It is impossible for a pitcher to work the
corners of the plate when he cannot see
the home rubber half the time Ihe home
plate is often lost to a pitcher's view dur
ing the game, as It is covered with dust^
and the umpire has no time to brush it off
till sides are changed. Charley Nichols
of the champions never experimented In
those puzzling slants, quick shots and
drop balls that you hear so much about.
He simply drives the ball up to the plate
-with plenty of speed to back it and good
control. Corner working and meteoric
curves never appeal to him. There is a
slight bend to his speedy ball, but control
iS Mr S C?lrk speaks with great intelligence
on this corner working, as he terms it. I
have heard pitchers talk of how they
worked the corners, yet I firmly believe
that the line is being drawn too fine.
When pitching myself I have depended
as do other twirlers, on my ability to put
the ball on the in or outside of the plate
if I thought the situation demanded it.
But in doing this I never considered my
self pitching for "corners, for, as Mr.
Clark says "the plate most of the time
is covered with dust and is therefore in
visible " I have batted against every
Ditcher in the National League, and can
recall but one of the many whom I
should consider a pitcher capable of lo
cating the "corners" of the plate, if. in
deed, such a feat be possible. He is Mr.
Dwver of the Cincinnati Club. As for
speed and curves, to my knowledge he
possesses neither, yet is a first-class
uitcher The secret of his success must,
therefore, lie in some other branch of
pitching, and that branch is control of the
ball I have been at bat with him in the
box! and his ability to put the ball out
side when I was away from the plate
and inside when I came closer, baffled me
completely. I stood in the box one day In
Cincinnati, after vainly endeavoring to
tear the cover off shoots, wondering
how it was that I could not hit such
easy pitching. After my third trip to
bat I began to watch and study his style.
I noticed that he hardly ever put a ball
straight over the plate unless he was
compelled. It was either outside or in
side according to what he deemed ad
visable, and the majority of times he was
correct. However, his balls did not cut
the outside or inside corner of the plate.
They were generally seven or eight inches
either way, and I do not consider this
cutting the corners, as some pitchers, I
believe delight in terming it. It is cer
tainly a case Of great control, but there
it rests. I have yet to see the pitcher
who can go through a game of ball cut
ting the corners, inning after inning.
Some of them might consider such pitch
ing as I have described in the case of
Dwyer as "cutting the corners," but I
must disagree with them on this 6core.
He comes about as near being the "ideal"
in this respect as I know of, but even he
is far from being the pitcher who can
"cut the corners." He, however, can
come nearer performing the difficult feat
than any pitcher I have seen In the
major league.
RELIANCE ATHLETICS.
An Evening's Entertainment in the
Oakland Club.
OAKLAND. Dec. 7.â The Reliance
Athletic Club gave its regular monthly
smoker and boxing entertainment this
evening. There were several very good
preliminaries and then came the two prin
cipal events of the evening. The first
bout was supposed to be an eight-round
go between Jack McMahon and Jimmy
Higgins, both of San Francisco. The first
two rounds were about even, but in the
third Higgins began to resort to foul tac
tics and back-heeled McMahon, throwing
him to the floor. Referee Fox stopped
the bout and gave the decision to Mc-
Mahan.
The next event was between Emll Dahl
of Alameda and Frank Schuler of San
Francisco. Both weighed 128^ pounds.
Dahl 1b a very strong,, determined fighter,
but Schuler was much too clever for him.
He hit Dahl whenever and wherever he
pleased. The bout went the route, and
the referee gave Schuler the decision,
which met with general approval, except
ing Dahl, who said he thought he had won
the fight. He was lucky he was not put
out. Only his pluck saved him.
FIRST OF THE CONTESTANTS.
Band of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum
Plays at the Charity .Bazaar.
The Anspacher band of the Hebrew Or
phan Asylum opened the musical contest
at the Charity Bazar last night. As this
is their first engagement of any conse
quence they were suffering a little from
nervousness, but at the signal from Con
ductor Mauser's baton all, from the tiny
chap who played the bass drum to the
cornetist, who is raising a mustache,
played away with a hearty good wili
which made up for some slight deficien
cies in smoothness. The method of judg
ing these contests is a new departure. All
selections will be taken on a graphophone
and the judges will render their decision
at their leisure. The San Francisco Am

Angry words followed, and the unknown
drew a knife and slashed Walls across

without effect, for the man took to his

90S Broadway, Dec. 7.
Another surprise was sprung to-day at
the hearing of William A. I'.randes, j
charged with beating to death his thir
teen-year-old daughter, Lillian, In the
way of a witness named Ramon Anan, a
cousin of the murdered girl, who resides j
at Santa Cruz.
Anan will be put on the witness stand j
to-morrow, and by his testimony the
prosecution hopes to prove that during a |
visit to Santa Cruz, before Lillian went to \
live at Berkeley, Brand* had said that i
If she did not behave herself when with j
him he would kill her.
Mrs. Mary Arrellams Br.indes, former
wife of the accused, and mother of the
murdered girl, who resides in San Fran
cisco, lias also been subpenaed and will
be called to-morrow provided there are
no more delays by protracted cross-ex
aminations.
Witness J. S. Harvey was further cross
examined to-tia\. lie continued his dam
aging narrative against Brandes. This
afternoon Harvey testified that Gillian
had asked him for a dollar and an old
bottle that had once contained poison.
She told Harvey that she had been ac
cused of stealing both, but protested her
innocence. Witness had told her that he
would tell the father that she hadn't
taken either, and he did so.
Witness <vi redirect examination said
his tiist Impression was that Lillian had
committed suicide, but he had now chang
ed and believt-d her death was due to mur
der.
Witness J. MiKi'nwn was next called
ami his testimony was mainly corrobora
tive uf that given by Mrs. Kobinson, Mrs.
Godfrey and Louis Long. He admitted
that he had remarked "he wished
Brandes, too, was dead." This remark.
hf Bald, was casual, and had been made
because "he had been compelled to come
clear from Sun Rafael."

WEST OAKLAND IS
NOT TO BE CAJOLED
WANTS A -AIR SHARE OF THE
MONEY RAISED FOR PARKS.
A Committee to Set Forth in Plain
Terms Just What That Sec
tion Demands.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
'."is Broadway, Dec. 7.
The West Oakland Improvement club
Is now at work considering how much
money will be necessary to provide a
proper park in that portion of the city.
A committee was appointed by the club
at its hist meeting to formulate a proposi
tion regarding the needs of West Oakland.
It is now generally admitted that this j
city needs some places for the public i
pleasure and as natural ornaments. ..a
election providing bonds for ' these ' Im
provements cannot be carried unless all
sections of the city are practically har- |
monious. With the park proposition as it â¢
now stands. West Oakland is not at all '
satisfied. Hut many of its prominent res- \
idents have expressed the opinion that :
If that portion of town be given a fair !
proportion of any money that may oe 'â 
raised it will not oppose improvements in
other parts of the city. The views of res- ;
idents in that part of town were thus set
forth by Colonel Irish at last night's
meeting:
I have listened to the speeches made to-night, j
end there are some arguments that seem to me
to be quite remarkable. Some say we will give
you this, or we will give you that. Now, I |
don't know of any committee in Oakland
that has the power to make terms with i
the people of this section of the city. We are I
to demonstrate to their satisfaction our acreage j
and what it, will cost to improve it and every
thing else. Nothing in favor of West Oakland
or North Oakland can be taken for granted.
Nothing is asked about the Adams tract,
whether the price Is a fair me. If the land
la available or the site a suitable one, but we
are to submit our proposition as children com- j
Ing to a parent. You cannot carry the bonds
on any proposition that does not Include the!
Interests â >; every part of the city.- We ought \
to have a waterway, a boulevard and a park
to beautify our. city. West Oakland doe* not
want a little postage stamp park here
and a revenue s-tam|i pork some other
place. We want enough money to secure
a decent park. Have a waterway at
.Adams Point, but have a park In West
Oakland. You talk about giving us something,
â¢when we are the givers now. You cannot carry
the bonds without us. and we are to say how
much wo desire of the appropriation. It has ,
been stated by people from other parts of the '
â  city that the marsh Is the proper place to
dump garbage. 1 tell you that this place Is
where the level park belongs. There you will
have a front door to the city that the city may
be proud of. Until you give us enough money
to do away with this eyesore andnosesore, you
will never ft the bonds, and It Is useless to
pubmlt .1 patchwork proposition to the people.

FOUND DEAD ON THE
FIRST STREET TRACK
FLAGMAN BLETHEN MAY HAVE
COMMITTED SUICIDE.
While Laijl Off Because of Sickness
an Aged Man Meets Death
Under Mysterious Cir
cumstances.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Dec. 7.
Charles A. Blethen. an aged flagman and
brother of Ex-Mayor Blethen, was struck
by the Alameda local on First street,
between Washington and- Broadway,
about 6:ir> o'clock to-night, and died at
the Receiving Hospital Just an hour and
three-quarters later.
So far as could be learned there were
no eye witnesses, and the -first intima
tion of the affair was the finding of the.
body lying near the track, after the train
had pulled out for Alameda,
The manner In which he was killed sug
gests that his death was not accidental.
The suicide theory has been advanced and
finds most believers. Bletheu had been
flagman at Seventh and Franklin streets
for many years. Of late his health had
been faiung and about a week ago he se
cured a leave of absence for a few weeks.
During the past few days he appeared to
be particularly discouraged and so ex
pressed himself to people about the Over
hind House, where he had been rooming
for the past twenty-five years. He was
an inveterate dealer in stocks and so far
as known had not been very successful.
At about 3 o'clock this afternoon Blethen
was seen loitering about on First street
by Flagman McKenzie. who was on watch
at the Broadway crossing. At thai lime
he seemed very despondent and It is sup
posed that hedeliberately threw himself
under the train, after it had fairly started.
The theory that Blethen might have
fallen off the train, after realizing that be
bad passed his station is exploded by the
fact as given by Conductor Robert Owens,
who says that the gates on the south
hide of'hlti train were closed when he
pulled out. and passengers arriving at
Broadway always alight from the north
side of the train.
Blethen demonstrated a remarkable
constitution and vitality, for when he ar
ris i-d at the Receiving Hospital his injury
was Immediately pronounced as fatal by
Dr. Stratton. There was a compound
comminuted fracture of the skull, expos
ing the brain over a circular area of
about three and one-half inches in di
ameter; the brain was lacerated; the left
,ye w.is torn from its socket, and his
collar bone was broken. Yet he lived until
8 o'clock. Deceased was a Dative of
Maine. ag-d 69 years.

The Murderess Will Have Her First
Experience in the Jus
tices' Court Next
Friday.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Dec. 7.
Did Mrs. Anna Mentel induce her youngr
husband to come to Alameda, knowing
that In the event of the worst happening
she would be more leniently dealt with
on this side of the bay than elsewhere?
Lawyers and those whose business takes
them around the courts are freely dis
cussing the circumstances surrounding
and leading up to the murder of William
F. Mentel a week ago. The story pub
lished in The Call to-day from Dr. Con
nor of San Francisco has caused many to
think that it was not accidental that the
murder occurred in Alameda. Dr. Con
nor says that a week after the marriage
Anna Mentel paced up and down in front
of his office till nearly midnight while her
husband was secreted inside, knowing her
to be on the lookout for him with a load
ed pistol, which she had threatened to
use. Now that these facts are gradually
being brought to light they dispel some
what the halo built around the murderess
by her parents, who declare that their
daughter was never out alter dark un
less in their company. Other testimony
has come to light proving that the girl
has frequently passed under different
names and that she Is of a romantic turn
of mind.
The opinion is expressed that if Clara
Fallmrr had been convicted William Men
tel would now be alive. There is some
ground for this opinion. Within the past
year Mrs. Gregory shot a man in her Ala
meda home and was acquitted. Clara Fall
m?r, who, like Mrs. Mentel, was a hair
dresser, once threatened to shoot her
lover in San Francisco. But she discreet
ly waited till they were in this county
before she carried out her threat.
The sympathy shown for little Durie
; Heithier is also recalled as possibly hav
ing had some influence on Anna Mentel,
but the latter, unwilling to make a saeri
; lice of herself to gain notoriety, shot her
husband. It is true that Mrs. Mentel shot
at herself, but the wound was only super
â¢ ficial. and It is recalled that there were
still one or two bullets left in the revol
; ver.
The date for the arraignment of Mrs.
Anna Mentel has been set for next Fri
day in Judge Morris' court in Alameda.
TWENTY-F./E YEARS
FOF, WILLIAM WEBER
INSANITY DODGE DID NOT WORK
THIS TIME.
Fiend Who Assaulted Little Girls
Will Spend His Last Days in
Folsom Prison.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. T.
At least one fiend has been given his
Just deserts for the commission of an
outrageous and heinous crime in Ala
meda County.
William Weber, who last Friday -was
convicted of a criminal assault upon
I,aura Johnson, aged 11 years, was this
j afternoon sentenced to *wenty-five years'
I imprisonment In Folsom prison.
There were several similar charges
against the prisoner, and in some cases
! the innocent little victims were but 9
years old. The crime on which the con-
I vietion was had was committed on June 2^
I of this year.
Weber appeared in court to-day, stoop
shouldered, pale and sickly. By his side
pat his attorney, Judge Frick, who argued
immediately on a motion for a new trial,
on the ground of insufficiency of evidence.
Then, too, the jury had recommended
mercy.
Judge Ellsworth, however, in denying
the motion, spoke briefly. He remarked
that he was well satisfied with the verdict
of the jury. He then commanded the pris
oner to stand Â»ip.
"You have been convicted by a jury,
and I believe justly, too," said his Honor.
"It is hereby ordered, decreed and ad
judged that you be confined in the State
prison at Foisom for a period of twenty
five years."
Weber uttered a peculiar and unearthly
exclamation of surprise and horrible real
ization, and fell back in his chair and
sobbed loud and long when he heard bis
sentence pronounced. He broke down
completely, and it was almost necessary
for the Deputy Sheriff to carry him from
the courtroom.
Weber is said to have rich relatives In
Germany, whence he came only a f>w
years ago. He showed by letters tfcat he
had been treated on two occasions for In
sanity, but for once the plea of insanity
was relegated to oblivion. He is a suf
ferer from asthma in its most aggravated
form, and by physicians pronounced ab
normal, and will beyond question pass his
last days behind prison walls, for though
but 2.. years old he has but few years
longer to live.
SWIFTWATER BILL
TO LOSE HIS HOME
GATES W-uLL tfOT SHINE IN OAK
LAND SOCIETY.
The Henshaw Mansion V. as Paid For
Largely in Promises lnat Are
delinquent.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 7.
Mr. "William Gates, otherwise "Swift
*vater Bill." has lost his last feather. His
East Oakland mansion, which he boughtâ
but only partly paid forâ is to be sold, and
the man who caused Oakland society
much discomfiture will either have to
settle very promptly or else give up his
possession in this city.
About a year ago Mr. Gates, accom
panied by the young dancer, who was
then his wife, decided to make Oakland
his home, and with much publicity he in
dulged her one day by buying for $25,000â
n more trifle, as he expressed it thenâ
the beautiful Henshaw home in East Oak
land. At that time Mr. Gates was
-quoted" at $1,800,000.
About the same time that he purchased
the house Mr. Gates organized a com
pany to make fortunes In th<> Klondike.
It was whispered that the purchase of
thÂ«> house was somewhat of a bait to
boom the "Swiftwater" stock on the
market, and that William had not put up
his $25,000. Developments to-day prove
this to have been true. Although he
contracted to pay $25,000, Gates only put
'. up $10,000 in cash and gave a deed of trust
I as security for the balance of the money.
In this deed it was agreed that the inter
est should be paid regularly and that In
case of his default the property should
be placed on the market for sale. His
phantom fortune quickly left him and
Mr. Gates has not been able to attend to
the payment of interest. He is now in
Seattle and has been served with notice
of his delinquency, but he has paid no
attention to it. and unless he sends some
of his "dust" to Oakland very quickly he
will lose the $10,000 he paid on deposit.
Proceedings have been leeun to sell the
property.
COMPANY B WINS.
Closing Exercises of the Military De-
partment of the State University.
BERKELEY, 7.â The final exer
cises of the present term for the military
department of the University of Califor
nia were held upon the campus this morn
ing. The two recitation periods, from
10:20 to 12:15, were devoted to a competi
tive drill of the companies In the two
battalions. The. work covered chiefly the
school of the company and the manual of
arms. Each company was marched out
from Its place upon the parade grounds
and was examined by Professor Frank
Soule. commandant of the corps, and
Colonel Melville S. Dozier. At the con
clusion of the drill the Judges decided in
favor of Company B, which was ac
cordingly awarded "the honor of carrying
the university colors for the coming
term.
The officers of the winning company
are: Captain, William H. Houston; first
lieutenant. Ralph C. Daniels; second lieu
tenant. Edward G. Kuster.
As soon as the competition was de
clared over, the two battalions were
formed in close order by the flagstaff to
listen to an address by President Martin
J. Kellogg. As the bugle sounded for dis
missal the colors on the flagstaff were
dipped, while the band played a patriotic
air, and the entire corps saluted. This
ceremony finished the work of the term,
nil further drill being susDended until
next January.
DEATH PREFERRED TO
PERSISTENT DUNNING
ARTIST SHRADER* SLASHES HIS
THROAT WITH A RAZOR.
After Going Through Insolvency He
Tries to Pay His Debts and,
Failing, Tries to Die.
AL.AMEDA, Dec. 7.â Weary of an un
equal struggle against multiplying finan
cial misfortunes and inability to endure
the persistent howling of unreasonable
creditors, Frederick Charles Shrader, a
lithographic artist of considerable repu
tation and a prominent citizen of this
city, attempted at an early hour this
morning to end his earthly troubles by
drawing the keen edge of a razor across
his throat. Fortunately his hand was not
steady and the steel did not cut deep.
Two superficial wounds are the only re
sult of the man's rashness.
Shrader reached his home, 339 Central
avenue, about midnight. He made prepa
rations to retire, but instead of going to
bed locked himself in the bath room and
made the attempt at decapitation. Mrs.
Rhrader thought her husband wa.Â« acting
strangely and made an investigation.
When she found the bath room door
locked and got no response from within
she called the neighbors to her assist
ance and sent for Officer Lawrenoe. The
policeman broke in the door and found
Shrader covered with blood, standing in
the middle of the room, brandishing the
razor and threatening to carve the first
man who approached him.
Lawrence succeeded in overpowering
him. although he fought like a demon.
It was found necessary to handcuff him
before be would allow a physician to
dress his wounds.
ShracW was taken to the Receiving
Hospital in Oakland this forenoon. To
morrow he will be examined by the Lu
nacy Commissioners. Shrader lost a com
fortable little fortune in a Kern County
land transaction. With the financial crash
went his homestead in Alameda. Being
forced to the wall he filed a petition in
insolvency and was granted his final dis
charge about a year ago. Later his cred
itors prevailed upon him to give notes for
the amounts the court had relieved him
from paying. The notes are now falling
due and the holders have been press
ing him for payment.
"I was driven to this by being hounded
by my creditors," said the injured man
at .the Receiving Hospital this afternoon,
"but 1 am sorry now for what 1 did and
realize that my death would not have
helped matters. 1 was doing my best to
pay these men and 1 hope they will appre
ciate it some day."'
Shrader refused to give the names of his
creditors. He has a wife and four little
children.
Nearly Crushed in an Elevator.
ALAMEDA, Dec. ".â Otto Morgan, who
resides on Buena Vista avenue. Alameda,
had a miraculous escape Tuesday from
being crushed to death in an Oakland
freight elevator. Morgan was going up in
the rlevator of the establishment where
he is employed and was between the sec
ond and third story, when he leaned
against the guard rail. It gave way un
der his weight and he fell between the
elevator and the wall. Fortunately, there
was a window at the point and the eleva
tor squeeed him through the panes. As
soon as the elevator passed him he threw
himself across the elevator shaft and fell
on the second floor of the building. Mr.
Morgan was severely bruised, besides be
ing cut with glass on the head and arms.

Mrs. Cordelia Botkirr has won what
nay prove to be her first technical ad
vantage in her fight for life. Twelve
men were chosen and sworn yesterday
to try her for murder, and now one of
the dozen citizen judges that were se
lected is not in the Jury box. After the
twelve men had been accepted and had
taken the oath, one of them pleaded
that his conscience was more exacting
than the scrutiny of either the prosecu
tion or the defense. He declared his
belief that he could not try the woman
falrl v and he was excused. .
It is argued that when this Juror was
released the trial had actually begun.
It is claimed that when the last of the
twelve chosen men swore to be fair, the
case was actually in progress, and that
if one juror was excused all should
have been. There may be much or little
in the contention. A preponderence of

given the defense Its first slippery
foothold on the ground of technicality.
The trial of Mrs. Botkin promises to
rival that of Durrant in sensational in
terest. When omirt was about to open
yesterday morniner the corridors of the
second floor of the City Hall were
black with a surging, jostling, eager
crowd, greedy for the morbid satisfac
tion of a glimpse of the accused woman.
Men and wnn"- strutrslod for positions
near the entrance to Judge Cook's court.
They swayed, and moved, and muttered
coarse words of discontent at each others'
Incivility.
When the doors of the courtroom were
oprned these men and women rushed pell
mell for seats as animals might havt
done for a bone. Women scrambled
over the backs of benches, perched them
selves on seats and made their hasty, of
fensive way to places of. advantage. Men
almost fought their progress Into the
court of Justice to positions where they
could feast their morbid eyes upon the
leading actors in the case. The spectacle
was not pleasant.
The trial has already assumed a tinge
of the theatrical. The lawyers for the
defense and for the prosecution are al
reaofy posing. They seom to feel and
seek the value of notoriety that asso
ciation with a sensational case inevita
bly brings. Thus far neither side has
made even casual references to the vital
issue of the trial. Mrs. Botkin's attor
neys appear to be in no way concerned
over 'the terrible chain of circumstantial
evidence around her. They have indica
ted nothing of her claim of innocence ex
cept a general plea of not guilty. They
have created the impression that the wo
man will escape punishment for a crime
for the simple reason that under certain
conditions the laws of this State and ol
others are powerless to punish even mur
derers.
There is In the attitude of the attorneys
for the defense an air of defiance and of
almost careless confidence. The horrify
ing story of the cruel murder of two
women has been forgotten in the new in
terest created by an effort to prove the
laws of the nation inadequate for the pur
poses for which they were made. Every
endeavor has been made to give promi
nence to the idea that a woman accused
of murder will not seek to combat the
testimony against her but will try only
to show that the guilty cannot always be
punished.
This fact resulted yesterday In an ex
ceptionally dramatic scene. Twelve jurors
had been sworn and chosen. They were
acceptable both to the prosecution and
the defense. Even the stock questions
of the legal examiner had not been asked.
When a talesman was rejected it was
because he was palpably disqualified to
try any one for murder. Jurors were in
consequence accepted quicklyâ almost un
precedently so In a case where circum
stantial evidence will be the major part
of the testimony.
After the twelfth Juror had been swori
the clerk of the court arose to read tht
Indictment against Mrs. Botkin. The read
ing was suddenly and most unexpectedly
Interrupted by one of the jurors who had
been sworn to try the case. Colonel J. S.
Young arose in the jurybox and declared
that he could not conscientiously act as a
juror. He had satisfactorily answered
the questions of the defense and the
prosecution. He had been accepted under
the conditions of the loose examination
of both sides, but he assured the court
that not enough questions had been asked
of him.
Neither the defense nor the prosecution
had taken the pains to inquire if he knew
any of the witnesses in the case. He Is
lessee of the Russ House, where Detect
ive McVey, the State detective of Dela
ware, has resided since his arrival in the
city. Mr. Young has frequently con
versed with MeVey in reference to the
Botkin case. Opinions were naturally
created by these conversations, but
neither the prosecutors nor the defenders
of Mrs. Botkin saw fit to ask the ordinary
questions that would elicit the informa
tion. As Mr. Young understood legal pro-,
cedure he did not feel at liberty to vol
unteer. When he was finally presented
with the Issue, however, he declared that
he did not believe conscientiously that he
could serve as a Juror.
Young was at once excused by consent
and the jury, which had already been
completed, lacked one member. It is now
claimed that the release of Young was
made after the trial of Mrs. Botkin bad
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1898.
technically commenced and that If one
juryman was excused all the others
6hould have been. The defense is not yet
ready to Indorse this contention, but Mrs.
Botkin has been given her first advan
tage.
Young supplied yesterday practically
the only interesting incident or the day.
The questioning of talesmen has been de
scribed. It suggested nothing beyond the
simplest legal forms. The crowd watched
in close interest and the lawyers posed. A
titter swept the room when such men as
J. C. Stubbs and William H. Mills were
called as talesmen and everybody knew
they would not respond. One juror more
must be obtained and will probably be
chosen this morning, when the prosecu
tion will open its case and present its
witnesses. One of the interesting inci
dents of the case will be the appearance
of Mrs. Botkin on the witness stand. She
will make a general denial of the charge
against her.
Hours before Bailiff Wheeler opened the
door of Judge Cook's courtroom yester
day morning a curious crowd, made up
of all classes and conditions of people,
began to gather in the upper corridors of
the City Hall. Several women, intent
upon getting a glimpse of the famous
prisoner, struggled toward the entrance
to the tribunal, dragging or carrying a
child. These heedless mothers paid no
attention to the cries of the child as it
was squeezed and bruised by the surging
mob. When the door was unbolted at
9:50 o'clock the eager, waiting throng
rushed, stumbling and pushing to gain a
seat as near as possible to the table
where Mrs. Botkin and her attorneys sat.
Several deputy sheriffs, who had been de
tailed to reserve seats for talesmen, who
had been summoned, were compelled to
use harsh words and much strength in
preventing every inch of space in the
room from being taken. Women, disre
garding modesty, clambered over the
railing, which runs under the gallery,
dividing the courtroom, and women more
agik\ but equally indecent, rushed pell
mell for the chairs reserved for witneses.
In the gallery the flght for choice posi
tion to view the courtroom was equal to
a football game. The attache, who un
locked the door from the outside*, was
carried into the gallery and almost
thrown over the seats by the crowd back
of him. No deputy sheriff had been de
tailed to the gallery and for several min
utes it seemed as though a knockdown
and dragout scrap was In progress. A
couple or young women, who had waited
over an hour for the gallery to be opened,
failed to secure a seat and their plead
ings and protestations were made to deaf
pars. Their dresses were torn and their
hair disheveled in the melee and their
hats were ruined. Their dilapidated ap
pearance did not concern them at the
moment; they had come early, hoping to
get a plimpae of Mrs. Botkin and Dun
ning, and their desire being thwarted, they
were on the verge of hysteria. Clerk Tollo
and Bailiff Wheeler stood in front of the
Judge's desk, calling. "Sit down," "Sit
down." "Keep quiet," "Order in the
court," but their'voices were drowned for
a moment or two. Officers forced their
way into the noisy mob and separated
men who were about to fight over seats.
Finally a semblance or order was secured
and as the door to Judge Cook's chambers
opened, the bailiff rapped three times with
his gavel and In a moment the room was
fairly quiet.
During all this turbulence Mrs. Botkin
sat, indifferent and unmoved, in her usual
seat. Her sister, Dora, equally unper
turbed, gazed out of the window. While
the crowd was waiting the prisoner's
coming at the courtroom entrance Deputy
Sheriff Boyle had succeeded in smuggling
her into the room through the Judge's
chambers.
As soon as the ten jurors who were
sworn in the day before yesterday had
answered the rollcall, Judge Cook asked
for the Sheriff's return on the special
venire of twenty-five talesmen who were
ordered to appear for jury duty. The
clerk made a list of the names returned
and then called the roll. While this for
mality was in progress George Knight
and Assistant District Attorney Hosmer
were holdng an informal but very ani
mated discussion. The chief counsel for
the defense had learned over night that
Juror Samuel H. Daniels, the bank teller
was a warm personal friend of Chief of
Police Lees, and he objected to his pres
ence in the jurybox. Hosmer and Chief
I^ees resented the request of the defense
and Knight then declared in his emphatic
explosive manner: "Well, Hosmer, if you
won't consent to excusing Daniels I shall
exercise the right of peremptory chal
lenge ana give my reasons to the court
why the Juror should not remain in this
trial."
"You may do as you please," retorted
Hosmer. "I suppose you want a sensa
tion by this time?"
"Sensation or no sensation, Daniels
shall not remain on that jury," Knight
angrily declared, as he* took his seat be
side his associate, Mr. Wheeler.
Just as this little side show, which had
been an interesting pantomime to the
spectators, ended, John P. Dunning and
Joshua D. Deane, whose wives were
murdered, -elbowed through the crowd to
the table where the prosecuting officers
sat. Dunning took a seat with the news
paper .reporters, his back to the audience,
and Mr. Deane held a brief whispered con
versation with Attorney General White
Detective McVey and Chief Lees. Learn
ing that his presence would not be re
quired until to-day, he left and did not
return. Miss Josephine Bateman, another
Delaware witness, remained during the
morning session.
About 10:20 the clerk had completed the
roll call of the special venire of twenty
five, about eighteen of whom responded
to their names, and his Honor ordered the
attorneys to proceed with the examination
of talesmen. Mr. Hosmer gave a syn
opsis of the indictment of Mrs. Botkln,
and F. L. Hunter and I. W. Hellman Jr.
were called to the two vacant seats In
the jury box. Mr. Hunter was examined
and passed by the prosecution, and was
turned over to Mr. Knight, whose anger
over the Daniels incident waa una
bated. The talesman admitted that ne
had formed an opinion that the defendant
was guilty, and that evidence would De
required to remove it.
"Now. if you were the District Attorney
there and accused of murder, would you
like to be tried by twelve men in your
frame of mind?" shouted Mr. Knight.
Mr. Hosmer exploded violent objection.
MRS. BOTKIN WILL TAKE THE STAND.
MRS CORDELIA BOTKIN expresses the greatest satisfaction at the (
quick progress made toward securing a Jury which will she believes.
of thes^entlemen Ido hope the jury will be immediately completed, so
! the Si of the^se can actually commence, and that it will ~on be termi
nated. I would have been satisfied with any twelve honorable citizens .who
i. were not prejudiced against me as a consequence of the malicious false
hoods which have been published in the daily press since my name became
â  connected with this unhappy tragedy. Ever since the moment the first
i mention of suspicion reached me that I knew aught of the poisoning of the
i poor woman my consciousness of Innocence has sustained me during my
i incarceration, and in confronting the curious crowds of morbid persons
i who are so persistent in seeking a glance at me. (
i "I am thankful that my physical strength has been concomitant with (
i my good spirits. Despite the lack of fresh air and the coarse fare of the (
i prison my health is excellent, and as I knew this ordeal would not con- <
i tinue to any length of time, I have not worried more than any natural <
woman would worry under similar unpleasant circumstances. Added to my I
' knowledge of my own innocence the assurances of Messrs. Knight, Me- I
' Gowan & Wheeler, that my trial will be quickly over, and I shall go free, I
are most gratifying, and I feel an unalterable conviction within me that I (
will be exonerated of any blame." '
Mrs. Botkin would not discuss the evidence which was submitted <
against her during the extradition proceedings, nor would she utter a single i
word about Dunning or any other witness for the prosecution or the de- (
fense. In concluding the interview she said: <
"My attorneys have decided to give me an opportunity to refute the (
slanders against me, by placing me on the witness-stand, when the proper <
time arrives. This decision is very pleasing to me and I shall seize the (
chance without fear or hesitation. When this trial is over the world will <
know that I am free of guilt." <
c
which was sustained by the court and
then sought to argue the point.
"Question withdrawn, stt down, Hos
mer," thundered Mr. Knight.
"I won't sit down," retorted Hosmer,
and Knight endeavored to mollify his op
ponent by saying:
"We've got along very nicely until
now; don't get mad."
"You started it." said Hosmer. and then
began addressing the court. His Honor
ended the first bit of friction so far in
the trial by peremptorily ordering coun
sel to proceed. Mr. Hunter was then chal
lenged by the defense and excused.
Mr. Hellman would not inict a death
penalty on a woman, and he was excused
under the statute. James V. Coleman
pleaded exemption from Jury duty be
cause he is an attorney. George D. Clark
was challenged by the defense, and de
parted, pleased to escape an unpleasant
duty. O. D. Baldwin also had an opinion,
which secured his dismissal. F. P. Sher
man was unsatisfactory to Mr. Knight,
and Alexander Hamilton would not give
a verdict which imposed a death sentence
on a woman, and both left the box. Tales
man after talesman, taking a cue from
these gentlemen, made similar replies
when examined, and the names in the
jurybox were soon exhausted. Judge Cook
ordered another special venire of twenty
flve citizens and adjourned court until 2
p. m.
Spectators, who had been unable to se
cure a glimpse of Mrs. Botkln, waited
outside the courtroom to see her as she
left for the Sheriff's private office, where
her lunch is served during the noon re
cess. The defendant and her sister re
mained in their seats for over an hour
and then tried to escape the crowd by
going out through the Judge's chamber.
She passed out quickly and hurried down
the long hall. But before they reached the
turn the mob was chasing after them.
Women lifted their skirts and ran as fast
as they could to overtake the hurrying
prisoner and before the haven of refuge
was reached, a hundred gaping individ
uals surrounded her.
During the recess Attorneys Knight and
Hosmer apain consulted the case of Juror
Daniels and after explanations were made
by Chief Lees, the defendant's attorney
withdrew his obiection and Mr. Daniels
will be one of the twelve arbiters of Mrs.
Botkin's fate.
At 2 o'clock the crowd awaiting admis
sion to the trial was double that of the
morning and was more eager and impa
tient to see the prisoner. Profiting by the
experience of the first session the bailiffs
were prepared to hold the crowd in check,
and very little disturbance occurred.
The examination of talesmen was re
sumed immediately after court recon
vened and continued uninterruptedly until
the jurybox was again almost exhausted.
Attorney Knight tried to facilitate mat
ters by declining to examine talesmen
passed by the prosecution and using
peremptory challenges when he was
dissatisfied with the juror. When
the names were almost exhausted
Colonel J. S. Young, proprietor of the
Russ House, and E. A. Keil of Gold
berg. Bowen & Co. were called. Both
gentlemen were satisfactory to all par
ties and they were sworn In to their ap
parent displeasure and annoyance. Then
occurred the most remarkable Incident of
this or any other murder case in the his
tory of California juries. As the lawyers
were preparing for the actual beginning
of the trial Colonel Young arose and ad
dressed the court, saying ho had not been
asked the required questions under the
law and he felt his conscience would not
permit him to act as a Juror where a hu
man life was at stake. He had read the
case and discussed it with witnesses and
begged to be excused. He was again ex
amined as to the state of his mind and
excused by consent. Mr. Keil remained in
the box, making the eleventh juror.
Several more talesmen were examined,
but none qualified and the venire was
again exhausted. Ten more citizens will
be drawn this morning, and without
doubt the jury will be completed and the
opening statement of the prosecution
made before noon.
All the witnesses are ordered to be
present at 10 a. m. to-day.
During the day the following citizens
were excused or challenged and thereby
escaped serving on the jury: George Net
well, challenged by Knight; Isaac Baer,
challenger by Hosmer; Fred Bowman, not
on the assessment roll; B. P. Flint, chal
lenged by Knight; C. T. Spader, chal
lenged by Knight; Thomas S. Williams,
deafness; H. H. Young, opposed to cir
cumstantial evidence; l*. L. Dodge, chal
lenged by Knight; George B. Warren,
opposed to death penalty on a woman;
Luman Waunam, bias; Samuel Bernstein,
opposed to death penalty in all cases;
George Lederer, the same reason;- Peter
Schlego, infirmity; L. .tx. Haas, disquali
fied. Among those eaUed, who did not
answer were: W. H. Mills and J. C

Pennsylvania Makes Changes.
A. S. Holt of Cincinnati will on the first
of the year take charge of the general
freight and passenger departments of the
Pennsylvania Railroad In this city, re
lieving William de Bell, who has been in
charge of the company's offices here for
the past ten years. The fact was made
known yesterday, when Mr. de Bell was

would be made on the first of the year.
It is said that the Pennsylvania Company
in the future will pay more attention to
the building up of its freight traffic. Mr.
de Bell is one of the best-known railroad
men in the city and one of the most ef

REFUSED HIS
OFFER TO FIX
A FELONY CASE
Attempted Bribery in
the Police Court.
PETER VERRE THE ACCUSER
SAYS HE WA6 APPROACHED BY
A CORPULENT MAN.
Sensational Developments Expected
in the Case of Alice Flynn,
Who Is Charged Witn r
Larceny.
The police are looking for a "stout
man," who attempted to bribe Peter
Verre, the complaining witness in the
case of Alice Flynn, charged with grand
larceny. On the night of November 30
Verre, who is employed as a cook at St.
Mary's College, was In a salmon on Mc-
Allister street, opposite the City Hall,
when he was introduced to the Flynn
woman. She claimed that one of the
deputies in the Registrar's office owed
her considerable money, and that he had
sent for her, intending to liquidate the in
debtedness. Verre had about $120 in his
pockets, and after buying several rounds
of drinks, he suggested that the woman
"take a walk" with him. She readily
acquiesced, and after visiting several
other saloons they finally brought up in
a lodging house on Turk street. Verre
fell asleep, and when he awoke, several
hours later, his well-filled wallet was
gone, as well as the woman. Convinced
that she had taken It, he hastily dressed
himself and went in search of a police
man. The latter notified Detectives Gib
son and Wren, who, after considerable
trouble, located the woman, and charged
her with grand larceny.
Last Tuesday the case was called in De
partment Two of the Police Court. After
listening to the statement of Verre, Judge
Conlan held the woman to answer In
$2000 bonds.
Rumors of an attempt being made to
"square" the complaining witness were
rife, but for want of corroborative evi
dence the matter was allowed to drop.
Last night Verre visited police head
quarters and confirmed the report that
he had been approached by a "stout man"
Just before he entered Judge Conlan's
court, who pretended to know him.
He asked him not to take the stand
against Mrs. Flvnn, after promising to
see that he obtained at least half of xhe
money he lost.
"As it stands, now," he remarked, ' your
money is not worth 50 cents on the dollar.
Have the case dismissed and I'll see that
you get a part dT your money back."
Verre refused his offer and testified
against the woman, with the result that
she was held for trial before the Superior
'After thinking the matter over Verre
concluded to notify the police of the at
tempt to bribe him. To-day an effort will
be made to ascertain the identity of the
"atout man" who approacnea him.
