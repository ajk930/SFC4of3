DISASTROUS FLOOD
SWEEPS THROUGH
NEW YORK STREETS
Collapse of the Largest Gas Tank
in the World Causes a Great
Tidal Wave.
People Canght in the Swirling Water Carried
Away Like Straws and Several Are
Drowned.
Special Dispatch to The Calt
NEW YORK, Dec. 13.â The great
steel gas tank of the Consoli
dated Gas Company at Avenue
A and Twentieth street, the
largest of its kind In the world,
collapsed at 5:30 o'clock this afternoon.
It went down with a crash and roar like
a great explosion.
Masonry of granite blocks and bricks
to the height of fifty feet fell like a
child's toy house of blocks and loosened
from bondage 8,000,000 gallons of water,
deluged the streets and in a ten-foot
tidal wave carried death and destruc
tion through the surrounding neighbor
hood. It Is not known how many were
killed and injured.
The dead so far recovered are:
ANDREW WENDT, workman.
JOHN GRAY, 75 years old.
PIUS BAUM, engineer in adjacent
factory.
The seriously injured are:
Catherine O'Connell, 4 years old, leg
fractured.
Peter Walker, dislocated shoulder.
About fifteen others, so far as has
been learned, were injured more or less
severely or almost drowned.
Missing:
George Brewer, timekeeper.
George Winkie. 15 years old, son of
Foreman Winkie.
James O'Connor, foreman In Fuld
ner's factory, adjoining, and believed
to have been in the basement â with En
gineer Baum, who was killed, is miss
ing.
The steel tank was ITS feet in diam
<ter and 160 feet high. Rising out of
the ground to a height of fifty feet was
a great circular wall of granite and
brick, many feet in thickness. This was
filled with 8,000,000 gallons of water. A
gang of men were at work under a
foreman filling the pit with water to
make the first "water test."
Suddenly came an awful crash. The
men below had scarcely time to flee
from beneath the falling walls ere they
were picked up by the mass of rolling:
water and hurled hundreds of feet
away. Into the basement, the first and
second floors of factories and tene
ments rushed the flood.
Workmen were shot out of the fac
tory windows and carried a block or
more as if mere straws. Women were
washed out of the flats and almost
drow-ned.
Mary Ann O'Connell and her little
four-year-old sister, Catherine, were
seated at the front window of the sec
ond floor of 33 Avenue A. Before they
could turn to flee a rush of water
struck them both, smashing them
through the door and carrying them
half a block distant. Both were terri
bly injured, the little one perhaps fat
ally.
Henry Fuldner was taken up bodily
and carried almost to Twenty-first
street. His son was also carried o\it
of his office by the water, but was
caught in the debris and but for the
timely arrival of some workmen with
â xxqb he would have been drowned.
Andrew "Wendt, one of the killed, was
near the base of the tank when it col
lapsed. He was caught by the rush
ing waters and borne I'most an incred
ible distance. His mangled and al
most naked body was found against an
elevated railroad pillar at Twenty-first
street and First avenue, more than a
block away.
W. J. Logan, of the Logan Iron
Works, of Green Point. L. 1., the con
tractor who was building the tank, ar
rived on the scene within a few min
utes after the collapse and was placed
under arrest.
W. H. Bradley, chief engineer of the
Consolidated Gas Company, and said
to be jointly responsible for the work
with Contractor Logan, was also
placed under arrest. They were
charged with homicide and their bail
was fixed at $10,000 each.
Aftpr the masonry of the tank col
lapsed the tank proper careened and
fell in a battered heap to one side. The
loss of the tank is said to be complete,
$300,000.
The collapse of the tank caused
the rupture of some of the
great water mains which were
constructed to feed it, and for
some time these poured their contents
into the streets. Eventually they were
closed
The San Francisco Call
The downtown district suffered
greatly on account of the accident, for
all the gas supplied by the Consolidated
Company in that part of the city was
shut off.

CHURCH IN AMERICA
Bishop Tikhou Arrives at New York
En Route to the Pacific
Coast.
NEW YORK, Dec. 13.â Among the
passengers arriving yesterday on the
French line steamship Champagne was
Bishop Tikhou, the newly appointed
head of the Russian church in America,
although nominally he is bishop of the
Aleutian Islands and Alaska. He was
met at the pier by the Russian Consul
General and members of the Russian
colony in this city and escorted at once
to the Russian church at 323 Second
avenue, where in accordance with the
custom of his church he conducted a
service of thanksgiving for his safe
arrival.
Bishop Tikhou will start for San
Francisco on Thursday, but intends to
visit New York and other orthodox
parishes in the East again before leav
ing. His new diocese is said to be the
largest in the world, as it includes the
whole of North America, and com
prises about thirty parishes, with as
many churches and seventy chapels.

PLOT TO PREVENT
DREYFUS REACHING PARIS
Action of the French League of Pa

Vigorous Measures.
LONDON. Dec. 13.â The Daily News
i publishes this morning a startling story
of an alleged plot of the French League
of Patriots, numbering 300,000, under the
notorious anti-revisionist, M. Paul de
Roulede, to prevent Dreyfus reaching
Paris.
According to the story of the correspon-

ABATEMENT OF THE SMELTER
SMOKE NUISANCE DEMANDED
Citizens of Butte, Montana, Cause Reduction Works
to Close Pending an Investigation' as
to Deaths.
T~\ UTTE, Mont., Dec. 13. â For nearly a week the smoke from the smelters here has been quite heavy, more
h< so than usual, and resulted in a public meeting of citizens to-night at which the managers of the smel-
J I ters were present to discuss and suggest means to abate the nuisance. The Butte Reduction Works, in
response to a general request to all companies, shut down twenty-four hours ago, but the smoke is as
thick as ever. It Is possible the other smelters will have to follow the example of the Butte Reduction
Works.
Several deaths that have occurred since the smoke became bad are attributed to that cause. While it is
doubtless a fact that the deaths from pneumonia were hastened by the smoke-charged air, it is also a fact that
on all occasions of this kind every death is attributed to the one cause.
The prevailing conditions have called for some very wild stories. The average death rate for this
month so far as can be learned is very little larger than for the corresponding period of the three preced
ing months, when there was no smoke whatever. The present visitation has been heavier and longer con
tinued than for many years past.
At the meeting of citizens and smelter men to-night a committee was appointed to look into the smoke
matter and report in ten days on some plan to abate the nuisance.

TRAGEDY IN THE
HILLS OF SOUTH
SAN FRANCISCO
Mrs. Selinger Found Horribly Mur=
dered in the Kitchen of Her
Home.
Suspicion Falls on Her Husband, Who Is Badly
Injured and Will Make No
Explanation.
Mrs. Selinger was found lying dead
on a lounge in the kitchen of her home,
38 Waterville street, South San Fran
cisco, with the back of her head blown
off by a charee of buckshot. On the
back stoop of the house, but a few feet
from the lounge on which Mrs. Selin
ger lay, sat her husband, Raimond,
bleeding from a great wound in his
forehead.
This briefly tells the story of one of
the most mysterious tragedies which
the police have been called upon to
deal with for a long time. It is mys
terious not because of dark, hidden
plots and secret whisperings, but from
the utter contradiction of things visi
ble and evident. The husband, faint,
weak and apparently wounded unto
death, tells a story which all the visible
evidences of the case seem to conspire
to contradict â a wild, almost impossible
story, and then comes the usual gossip
of the neighbors.
Waterville street is one of the ob
scure little thoroughfares in the lone
some hills of South San Francisco,
hardly marked even by a wagon track.
There are few houses in the neighbor-
hood. The numerous hollows among
the hills form the feeding place for
hundreds of wild duck and the crack of
the hunter's rifle is heard so often that
little or no attention is paid to the
sound.
No. 38 is a brown, one-story cottage
am 1 , in it lived until yesterday Raimond
Selinger and his wife. The husband is
a brewer by occupation, but for some
time past has been out of employment,
and according to the neighbors has
been drunk a great deal. The couple
were said to be very quarrelsome and
passers by often heard voices pitched
high in quarrel.
The last person known to have seen
Mrs. Selinger alive was a brewer named
Miller. He called on the couple Mon
day afternoon, took dinner with them
and left at about 7 o'clock in the even
ing. All seemed to be well at that
time.
The next story comes from a boy
named Russi, who delivers milk in the
neighborhood, and it tends to throw
some light on the mystery. He says
that he was passing the house Monday
evening between 7 and 8 o'clock and
heard the couple quarreling. This was
nothing unusual, but he stopped a mo
ment out of boyish curiosity. What
he heard startled him so much that he
hurried away without waiting for any
PRICE FIVE CE^TS.
thing further. It was the loud angry
voice of the man Selinger making the
threat, "if you don't shut up I'll kill
you." Then the defiant retort from the
woman, "I don't care if you do." This
was all he waited to hear. It is an
eerie locality at best and such words
are not likt'ly to encourage any loiter
ing propensities in a boy's bosom. He
did just what was to be expected â took
to his heels and ran.
In the morning neighbors noticed
that there were no signs of life about
the place and became curious. Three
or four women collected in front of the
house, but none cared to venture in.
H. M. Nutter, a miller living at 202 El
mira street, was attracted by the group
and stepped over and asked what was
the matter. "I think there's something 1
wrong in the house," said one of the
women. "Nobody's been around all
morning." Nutter went up and knocked
at the door. Selinger answered from
inside and in reply to a query stated
that everything was all right.
Later in the day, Carl Dickman came
to take the usual order for meat, but
could get no response to repeated
knocks and summoned the neighbors.
A ladder was obtained and he climbed
in the kitchen window. The sight in
side froze his blood with horror.
On a lounge in one corner of the room
lay Mrs. Selinger, cold and stiff in
death. The hands were thrown out
ward, the head and body covered with
clotted blood from a gaping wound in
the back of the head. An empty shot
gun lay on the floor. There was a
pool of blood at the foot of the lounge
and another â¢ near the door leading
from the kitchen to the hall. The wall
just over her head was perforated with
shot and the upper jamb of the door
was also blown to pieces from another
charge. The room was in the great
est confusion. Everything breakable
was broken and it was evident at a
glance that there had been a hot bat
tle in the kitchen of the lonely little
home.
Just as the trembling boy emerged
from the house Officer Ennis of the
Fourteenth-street station arrived. He
tells the story as follows:
"At about 1:30 o'clock I was patrol
ling my district and noticed a crowd in
front of the Selinger house. I went up
and inquired, and in a few words the
people informed me of the tragedy. I
climbed 'in through the window and
found the body lying on the lounge. It
was stiff and cold; blood had ceased to
flow from the wound and death had
evidently taken place some hours be
fore. The woman was partially dress
ed. I should judge she had been pre
paring to retire for the night when the
fatal shot was fired. I noticed a man's
hat lying in a pool of blood under the
door leading into the hall and the up
per part of the doorway was riddled
with shot. It looked .as though some
person had stood under the door, shot
himself and fallen on the floor.
"I then passed into the hall and from
there to the bedroom. The bed was
disturbed on one side only, and it was
evident that but one person slept in
it. The pillow was covered with clotted
blood.
"I passed into the parlor, which had
not been disturbed. It is a small room,
scantily furnished. I then went around
the house and found Selinger sitting on
the back stoop, and such a sight I hope
never to see again. He was clad only
in his underclothing, and sat double*
up with his head resting on his handfc.
There was a great wound in his head,
from which blood was slowly oozing,
and he was covered from head to foot
with clotted blood. I asked him about
his wife, and he denied that she was
dead, but admitted that he knew she
was hurt. "I don't know who hit her
or who hit me, but I'm hurt bad," he
said, and declined to talk any more.
I wrapped him up in a blanket and
took him to the hospital in my cart.
"It looks to me as though the two had
had a quarrel and Selinger shot the
woman and then himself, but how he
could murder his wife and then crawl
into bed in the next room and stay
there all night is a mystery to me. I
am satisfied, however, that the deed
was done early Monday evening, prob
ably about 8 o'clock. There must have
been two shots fired, as one empty car
tridge was lying on the table, and there
was another empty one in the barrel of
the gun. I do not believe there
was any third party in the case."
Sellnger, when seen at the City and
County Hospital, denied all knowledge
of his wife's death, and pretended to
scoff at the idea that there was any
thing wrong with her. He said:
"I went home about half-past 5 last
evening. I had drunk during the day
seven or eight beers and two glasses of
whisky. My wife had cooked pork
chops for dinner and I quarreled with
her for not cooking something else. We
had our dinner and drank some wine,
and our quarrel was continued. Finally
she took the key of the front door and
said she was going to leave me and go2
to her aunt, Mrs. Schwart, on Seven
teenth street. I took the key from her,
locked the door and put the key in
my pocket. She had a piece of blue
stone in her hand, which she had used
for washing:, and I took it also and
threw it into the garden.
"I went to bed about 8 o'clock and
â vvnkr up about 5 o'clock this morn'.ng.
I told my wife to get up and feed the
chicken? and she got up slowly. Sho
made my breakfast about 7 o'clock.
"When I woke up I discovered the
wound on my forehead and wondered
how I pot ir. but said nothing to her
about it. About 9 o'clock I went to
nn Italian barber at the Golden City

how I pot the vound in my head, and

came and took me away. I did not

: ngrer stuck to his story, admit
however, that no om was in the
house exc.pt him and his wife. He had

HONORS OF WAR
FOR DEAD GARCIA
Funeral Services Over
the Patriot.
NOTABLEGATHERING PRESENT
MILITARY GUARD ESCORTS THE
PROCESSION.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â The solemn
high mass of the Catholic Church was
performed over the remains of General
Calixto Garcia at St. Patrick's Church
to-day before the body of the distin
guished Cuban leader was committed
to the vault in the National Cemetery
at Arlington. The service -was not
able for the distinguished gathering
present. All the honors of war that
could be meted out to a national hero
were bestowed by this Government on
the lion-hearted old Cuban. Havana
itself would scarcely have poured forth
a larger crowd than gathered in and
about the church, and the most radical
of the Cuban independents could not
have picked a flaw in the official marks
of consideration bestowed upon the re
mains of their venerable leader.
The church was filled to the doors
long before the funeral procession from
the Hotel Raleigh arrived. Escorted
by two batteries of United States ar
tillery, the procession halted before the
door, and the military guard grounded
arms with a ring of metal on the hard,
cold pavement while at the same mo
ment the church bell aloft tolled slow
ly and solemnly in the crisp winter air.
Inside the church the great crowd
was hushed to perfect stillness,
through which the first notes of the
organ thrilled with a strange tense
ness, and rising slowly, swelled into a
tender harmony that seemed to be
more like a lullaby than a dirge. The
altar was draped in the emblems of
mourning and the candles stood in
black sconces, except at the foot of the
catafalque, where the golden can
delabra, with their many branches,
flared in the gusts from behind the
chancel.
The solemn procession moved down
the aisle from the door, the casket
borne by a detail of artillerymen.
The Cuban flag was draped over the
silver-mounted coffin. To the left, in
pews reserved for them, sat the honor
ary pallbearers â General Nelson A.
Miles, commanding the United States
army; General Lawton and General
"Wheeler, who were among the first to
greet General Garcia in Cuba; Gen
eral Shafter, commander of the Amer
ican Army of Liberation; Senator
Thurston, whose devoted wife lost her
life less than a year ago in visiting the
unhappy island In behalf of the Cuban
people: G*Â»*r^ r^'fi'TTi and Senators
Proctor, Mason and Money. % â¢::.,
.The coffin was deposited before the
altar and the solemn high mass was
begun. Those who officiated were:
Rev. Joseph Magee, deacon; Rev.
Charles Warren Currier of Baltimore,
sub-deacon, and Rev. Clarence E.
Woodman. The sermon was by â  the
Most Rev. Archbishop John Ireland,
the absolution after the mass by Rev.
George Dougherty, master' of cere
monies at St. Augustine's, Washington,
and there were present in the sanctu
ary Right Rev. Sbarrettl of the "apos
tolic delegation, Monsignor Stephan of
the Catholic Indian Bureau, Rev. Dr.
Rooker, secretary of the apostolic dele
gation, and other priests.
A preliminary service was held at the
hotel by Rev. Joseph Magee. At the
conclusion of the mass the body was
transferred to Arlington with military
honors, where it .was deposited in a
vault to await shipment to Cuba.'

SECRETARY BLISS
WILL SOON RETIRE
This May Cause Several Trans
fers to Be Made ir} the
CabiQet.
CORNELIUS N. BLISS, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â 1t is probable that Secretary Bliss will ten
der his resignation within a short time to the President. He has had
the step under cunsii.hrrat.ioM for some time, deeming it nece.-sary
that he should be tree to devote more attention to his large busi-
ness interests. The resignation, it can be stated, will not be due
in the leaet to any difference with the President or his other advisers, but to
Mr. Bliss' reluctance for purely private personal reasons to continue lcmger in
office as Secretary of the Interior.
The retirement of Mr. Bliss in the near future will give President Me-
Kinley a much-coveted opportunity to disengage 'himself from the political
tangle in which he is at this time involved. The United States Embassy
to Great Britain has been vacant since the retirement from that post of
John Hay, now Secretary of State. President McKinley has been anxious
to appoint Whitelaw Reid, one of the Paris Commissioners, but Senator T.
C. Platt of New York, being opposed to him, threatened to oppose his con
firmation in the Senate. The President has promised the appointment to
Keid, but does not want to offend Mr. Platt, for he needs every vote he can
get in the Senate to carry nut his policy of expansion.
It was suggested to-night that Joseph H. Choate might be offered a
Cabinet portfolio, or that the President might placate Mr. Platt by offering
it to another New Yorker to be named by the Senator. It is not believed
that either Choate or Reid would want the Secretaryship of the Interior, but
it is said that in consequence of Bliss' retirement several Cabinet transfers
may result, so as to make a place available which either Choate or Reid
might accept.

tain James Nelson, of the halibut slood
Caroline, and Barney Phale. a fisher- j
man, went ashore on Kupriauoff !
Island, in Portage Bay, to hunt for j
deer. Phale never came back, and the I
captain tells that he was deliberately
shot by Indians. This explanation Is
accepted by the halibut fleet that fishes
in Frederick Sound.
Captain Nelson say* Phale was only
a few hundred yards from him. but he
not see him on account of the
underbrush. He heard a shot. and.
going in that direction, found Phale al
ready dead. Phale's gun was loaded
and he could not have shot himself.
The tribe did not want the fishermen
to hunt in their country and kill their
game. The killing will be investigated
by the authorities here.
The feeling against the white men is \
increasing among the Indians, owing \
to the encroachment of the whites.
This is only one of several instances
in which this animosity has recently
Bhowa itself.

Tournament to Be Held

CRACK RIDERS WILL MEET
DOWNING AND STEVENS IN A
MATCH RACE.
Two Open Events Down for a Deci
sion Undoubtedly Will Have
a Large Number of
Starters.
Special Dlsi>ateh to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 13.â The Garden City
Wheelmen are jubilant over the out
look, for the big race meet to be
given at Cyclers' Park in this city on
Monday, January 2.
The match race between Hardy
Downing, the crack professional of the
Garden Citys, and Orlund L. Stevens,
who is reported to be the fastest sprint
er in this country, is attracting a great
deal of attention. Downing went a
quarter of a mile in something like
:24 flat at the track while training last
Sunday, and is riding in better form
every day. What he will do on the
day of the meet is, of course, a matter
of speculation; but his friends are
sure that he has a good chance to win
the $250 for which the two men com
pete. Stevens, of course, already has
a world-wide reputation, and if it were
a mere matter of sprinting he wc/uld
undoubtedly win. Downing depends on
hard riding all the way and this may
win the race for him.
The two open events will undoubtedly
be well tilled. 'From San Francisco
comes word that McNess, Walter J.
Davidson and Arthur Davidson are
training hard for January 2. Russ Ful
ler and Bozio of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen will most likely be induced
to enter. "Jack" Wing, who has been
doing so much record breaking of late,
may enter either one or both of the
amateur events, and in that event
would give Fuller a hard rub. There
are a number of local riders who may
make a showing that will surprise
their friends.
Negotiations for the race between
"Bunt" Smith, now a member of the
Bay City Wheelmen, and J. E. Wing,
a resident of San Jose, have practically
fallen through. There has been much
correspondence between the two, but
nothing has come of it. On Sunday
Smith had a personal conference with
"Jack" Win? at the club rooms of the
wheelmen. Wing was eager to ar
range a match race, and even offered
to ride for nothing. Smith would not

AGNEWS BOARD
MAY HEED THE
PUBLIC VOICE
Inquiry Into Bessie
Bailey's Death.
MANAGERS NOT YET DECIDED
WILL REACH A DETERMINATION
TO-DAY.
Should It Be Decided to Investigate
the Mystery, It is Declared
There Will Be No White
washing-.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 13.â The board of
managers of Agnews Asylum held an
adjourned meeting in Secretary Mont
gomery's office this evening and dis
cussed the mystery surrounding the
death of Bessie Bailey. After consid
ering a few biils the board went into
executive session. The question of
holding an investigation was brought
up. but no definite action was taken.
When the board adjourned it was with
the understanding that the question of
investigating the girl's death would be
determined at to-morrow's meeting.
The full board was present.
From what took place this evening, it
appears that some of the managers
have been looking into the mystery in
dividually. The doctor who saw the
girl on the train, and Conductor Roach,
on whose train the girl left the asylum,
have been communicated with, and
their accounts were related to the man
agers. The majority of the board is
inclined to think that death resulted
from natural causes, but the members
deem it wise to investigate because of
public opinion. Then rumor has It
that Dr. Sponogle and his assistants,
Drs. Stocking and Christal, are not
Batsified with the outcome and may de
mand that the managers clear their
names of any insinuations that may
have been made.
Before the meeting to-morrow the of- j
flcials at the asylum will be consulted. ''
If an investigation be decided on it will
be a searching one and no whitewash
ing will be done. This was the declara
tion of White and Upham this evening.
Dr. Hood of Elko and Dr. Ware of Col
fax may be called as witnesses and spn- ;
sational developments may occur.
The Santa Clara County legislative
delegation will be present to-morrow !
and inspect the asylum. It wil be asked
t" work for a $15,000 appropriation to;
sink an oil well. Good oil indications
have bee n found on the grounds, and i
as fuel is an important item of ex- j
pense a strike of oil would materially
reduce the cost of operating the asy
lum.
HE TREATED BESSIE
BAILEY ON THE TRAIN
COLFAX. Tier. 13â Pr. Ware has
ni.-xle nn affidavit relative to his care
and treatment of Bessie Bailey on the
train between this city and Truckee. It
is understood that this affidavit is to be
used In an investigation to be held by
the trustees of the Agnews Asylum or
by the State Lunacy Commission.
The affidavit c- 'ains certain infor
mation not suitable for publication,
which indicates that Miss Bailey did
not have that moral protection that is
expect til to surround charges of the
State. The remainder of the affidavit
follows:
On November 17. 1898. I received a tele
gram requesting me to meet the east
bound overland train No. 1 to prescribe
for a sick passenger. On the arrival of
said train, shortly after 3 p. m., I boarded
the tourist car and was taken to a young
woman . who was moaning and apparently
in great pain. She at once begged for a
hypodermic of morphine, which I declined
to give her.
After relieving her from pain by other
means, I gave her a small dose of mor
phine, not to exceed twenty drops of tinc
ture of hyoseyamus. This was followed
by a sleep of from an hour arid a quarter
to an hour and a half in duration, from
which she awoke much refreshed and ate
well of a lunch she had with her.
Abmit 8 p. m. she was restless, moan
ing, hysterical and making some noise,
and at this time I counted her pulse and
found it 78, the temperature was normal.
She still asked for a hypodermic of mor
phia occasionally.
At this time the manager of the tourist
party consulted me about the advisability
of Miss Bailey's continuing the trip.
After considering all the circumstances.
I concluded that it was best for her to
continue the trip. .
Before leaving the train I procured half
an ounce of bromide of potassium and told
the manager to dissolve it in a teacup (8
ounces) of water, and if Miss Bailey con
tinued nervous to give her a teaspoonful
every hour or, in case of necessity, a tea-
Bpoonful every half hour, but if she was
not soon relieved or did not do well, not
to rely on the medicine, but to call a phy-
S When I left the train at Truckee Miss
Bailey was quiet and appeared comfort-
In 'a physical examination of the chest
made under very adverse circumstances
I found evidences of bronchial catarrh,
but no evidence of heart trouble could
trip to Truckee she was hy
sterical; cried and laughed by turns,
begged loudly for morphine, and was rest
leiS: After her sleep she was much more
q She told me that an operation had been
performed upon her at the hospital for
?he relief of a bladder difficulty, bin that
it was not entirely successful. She re
ferred distinctly to this operation as hav
ing been for the relief of bladder trouble,
and made no reference to any other ope
ra ShÂ°e n made some reference to a love affair
between herself and a young man. but
dated the affair several years back and
had nothing to say about any undue inti
macy with any one. There was no refer
ence to any recent love affair.
She told me where she was traveling,
said that she did not want to live and
spoke of suicide several times, but did
not seem very earnest about it and I was
not strongly impressed with the belief
that she would destroy herself, though I
warned the manager to look out for her.
She was sad and gay by turns, quickly
changeable. .
She had in her satchel some medicines,
some glycerine, anti-kamnia tablets and
laxative pill*. The pills she said con
tained strychnine, and I took them away
from her 'and placed them in charge of
one of the passengers.
I do not know whether she had taken
f,ny of her own medicine. She showed no
evidence of being under the influence of
morphine or any other narcotic or seda
tive.
At the time I left her I did not consider
her condition dangerous, though it might
become so from a recurrence of her blad
der trouble..
If her death was from natural causes it
is my belief from what I saw of her that
it was probably due either to uremlc poi
poninsr or acute pulmonary congestion.
The young woman gave me her name as
Miss IJessie Walght but I ascertained
from the passengers and the manager
thnt she was a Miss Bessie Bailey.
Following the affidavit is this state
ment in Dr. "Ware's own handwriting:
COLFAX. Cal., Dec. 12.â She gave me a
tenndotlfr gold piece in payment for my
attendance. She said she did not have
a great deal of money, but could spare $5.
I had no change and presented the ten
dollar gold piece to Mr. Boyd, the excur
sion .conductor, and he gave me the
change â five dollars in paper and five dol
lars in gold. She also had with her some
powders of sulphonal, perhaps a half
dozen, containing at least five grains or
possibly more. C. D. WARE, M.D.
CARRIES A NEW FAITH
AROUND THE WORLD
Mission of Rev. H. N. Harriman, the
Disciple of the "Four-Fold
Doctrine."
TACOMA, Dec. 13.â Rev. H. N. Har
riman, formerly pastor of the First
Baptist Church of Tacoma, who quit
his flock at a time when a split was
the outcome of his new doctrine, is like
ly to be heard from at no late day. He
is now on a tour of the world â as yet
in America, but expecting to make the
round of the globe eventually. He is
preaching what is known as the "Four
fold doctrine."
Two years ago this doctrine, particu
larly its sanctiiication feature, led to
the formation of Eccelsia Mission here
by Key. Mr. Harriman and his follow
ers, who left the Baptist church be
cause its officers would not permit their
radical teachings in that church. Ec
celsia Mission has prospered, having
now several hundred regular attend
ants, several dozens of 'whom hoid
nightly prayer meetings on the princi
pal streets, besides conducting a down
town mission.
Rev. Mr. Harriman has remained the
mission's leader, working without sal
ary and supporting himself and a fam
ily of seven children by such volun
tary contributions as came to hand.
Several times he has had long spells of
fasting, when he believed, he received
divine inspiration.
Last fall he felt a distinct "call" to
preach the gospel in foreign lands, as
did Christ's disciples of old. About
two weeks ago he started East, and
preached in Chicago last Sunday. He
writes back that ho will go around the
world, trusting to the Lord to provide
the moans of his going. He will visit
Palestine, and will endeavor especially
to establish missions in the Philippine
Islands. His family is left without
any income, but they sanction his go
ing and believe the Lord will provide
for them also.
So far they are getting along com
fortably, one or two of his sons being
old enough to contribute to their sup
port.
DIAMOND MERCHANT'S
SON KILLS HIMSEL*
Walter S. Goodlett Commits Suicide
Because His "Remittance Was
Delayed.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 13.â Walter S.
Goodlett of Brichen, Scotland, son of a
wealthy diamond merchant, committed
suicide at Lakeside this morning by
shooting himself in the head with a
charge of shot.
(Joodlett left word last night to be
called at 6:30, saying he might decide
to take the early morning train for San
Diego. On arising he took his shotgun
and went out as if for a stroll. It was
noticed that he had on a new suit of
clothes not adapted to hunting, but it
was thought he was to go only for a
short walk. When he failed to return
for luncheon search was made and his
body was found under the trees at the
east end of the lake with the top of
his head blown off by a double charge
of birdshot.
Young Goodlett was 23 years of age,
but was of powerful build and appeared
much older. He had had all the ad
vantages of education, travel and
wealth. For some years he was en
gaged in mining and in army life in
South Africa. He had been several
times around the world. Two or three
years ago he visited Hotel del Coron
ado and last April he arrived again for
a longer visit. He remained at
Coronado until a few weeks ago, when
he went to Lakeside Hotel for a few
days' shooting.
It was learned that Goodlett was
quite depressed before leaving Coronado
over the fact that his remittance from
home did not arrive. He was put to
sore straits for money and was as
sisted by an intimate friend, a coun
tryman, so far as known.
The body was brought to th!s city
to-night and an inquest will be held to
morrow morning.
STATUS OF MORTGAGES
AND MECHANICS' LIENS
Peculiar Case Decided by Superior
Judge Buckles of Solano
County.
SUISUN, Dec. 13.â Judge Buckles of the
Solano County Superior Court to-day de
cided a case involving a peculiar legal
point. Suit had been brought to foreclose
two mortgages and certain mechanics'
liens upon the same property. Mrs. G.
Hutton owned a certain lot on which the
Continental Building and Loan Company
held a mortgage. Later she purchased an
adjoining lot from Mrs. Mary McLain,
giving a mortgage upon the lot in part
payment. Prior to the execution of the
mortgages the construction of a building
was begun upon the lot mortgaged to the
building and loan company. Eventually
this building was extended over upon the
other lot. Judge Buckles decides that the
mechanics' liens acquired by the con
tractors who constructed the building
hold only upon the main structure cover
ing the first lot, having priority over the
mortgage held by the building and loan
company. The mortgage on the second
lot, however, which was executed before
the building was extended over upon this
lot, has priority over the mechanics' liens.
He further decided that the portion of the
building erected on the lot purchased from
Mrs. McLain, being separable, is subject
to the mortgage claim of Mrs. McLain be
fore ajiy mechanics' lien can attach
thereto.

ALDERMEN NOW
HOLD SESSIONS
IN SECRET
Sub-Committee Is Yet
at Work.
PREPARE SHORT EXTENSIONS
CHICAGO RAILWAYS YET HOPE
FOR THE FRANCHISES.
Mayor Harriron, However, Is Deter
mined That Action Will Not
Be Taken Until i.ne Allen
Law Is Repealed.
Special Dispatch to Tne Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. 13.â A new tack has
been taken by the street railway peo
ple, as represented by the joint com
mittee of the Council to which the Ly
man franchise ordinance was submitted
by the Council. The sub-committee of
the joint committee, appointed to con
sider the ordinance or frame another,
as it chose, resumed its work to-day,
claiming the action of the Council last
night merely took from it the Lyman
ordinance, leaving the Hermann and
several minor ordinances in the' sub
committee's hands. The authority of
this sub-committee now depends on the
construction of Alderman Walsh's res
olution adopted last night and the in
tent of the Council in passing it. The
sub-committee was in secret session
this evening in the private office of
Alderman Kimball.
Mayor Harrison says nothing was
won or lost at the Council meeting last
night and that the people now know
where some of the Aldermen stand In
the fight, but that the traction com
panies are beaten so far as long term
franchises are concerned.
It is the intention of this sub-com
mittee, and this intention is not con
cealed, to "put the Mayor in a hole," if
it can, and to this end it will proceed to
formulate an ordinance granting street
railways franchises to extend for
twenty years, fixing the rate of com
pensation to the city at 10 per cent of
the yearly gross earnings of the com
panies, establishing a system of trans
fers, etc. In fact, they will embody
all the ideas of the Mayor as to the
sort of an ordinance that will be pleas
ing to the people, and then dare him to
veto it.
This plan Is to be forwarded for the
dual purpose of embarrassing Mayor
Harrison in his position of refusing to
treat with the companies and of divid
ing public sentiment long enough to
permit the gang to rally its forces and
put through the Council such ordi
nances as the companies are willing to
ask for.
The joint committee still has in Its
possession, according to the arguments
of Francis, Cuilerton. Kimball and Mp-
Inerney, the dominant spirits in the
sub-committee, the Hermann ordinance,
the Math ordinance and the Kimball
ordinance, and with these for authority
most of that body believe they can go
ahead and listen fo the arguments of
the traction companies in search for
facts to form conclusions and build an
ordinance for recommendation to the
Council.
Mayor Harrison still stands upon his
declaration that nothing shall be done
until the Allen law is repealed and
when asked about the attitude of the
joint committee, replied: "They still
have the Hermann ordinance before
thorn, but the intention of the Council
last night was to recall from the joint
committee authority to consider the
franchise question. There is no doubt
of that, and it is a question whether
the sub-committee has any powers."
Samuel W. Allerton, the millionaire
packer and large holder of Chicago
City Railway stock, said to-day if the
city did not want to grant fifty year
franchises the railway companies
would not be badly hurt.
"We have franchises," said he. "on
our trunk lines for fifty years, anyhow,
and nobody can touch them. There is
not anybody that would want our
cross town lines without trunk lines,
because they would not pay. The city
would let us go ahead."
Further than that, he said the pres
ent agitation was hurting Chicago
greatly and that moneyed men in New
York absolutely refused to lend money
here because of the contest now going
on here and the opposition manifested
toward corporations and capital.
McKinley Cheered in the South.
SALISBURY, N. C, Dec. 13.â The Presi
dential train arrived here just before mid

was without incident. At Lynchburg hun
dreds of Virginians were gathered at the

the weather was very cold. The train
stopped there only about three minutes.

UNCLE SAM CALLS A HALT
GENERAL WADE INSTRUCTED T2
CHECK THE DEAL.
If Necessary the Principals in thy
Enterprise Will Be Promptly
Arrested and Im
prisoned.
Special DiFrntrh to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â From in
formation received here it appears that
the autonomist government of Cuba,
established a year ago, is making stren
uous effort to dispose of a number of
very valuable franchises and conces
sions before the advent of the military
government of the United Statfs.
These franchises and concessions in
clude tht right to construct and operate
the Central Railroad line of the island.
including eleven branches, and also a
network of electric tramways for Ha
vana. The authorities first secured an
agreement with General Wade at Ha
vana by which Spanish sovereignty
over the' island was to cease and for
mal occupation by the United States
begin on January 1, 1899. Advertise
ments were subsequently prepared and
inserted in a Havana newspaper, ask
ing for bids for these concessions and
franchises, the same to be opened and
presumably the award made on De
cember 29 of the present year, two days
before the government is formally
turned over to the United States.
The President, however, has seen fit
to put a quietus upon the enterprise of
the Spaniards, and has issued instruc
tions to General Wade, the chairman of
our evacuation commission at Ha
vana, immediately to inform the offi-
cials of the Spanish autonomist gov
ernment that the United States
strongly disapproves of the proposed
disposition of the concessions and fran
chises described, and to ask that all
negotiations for the same be discon
tinued. It seems probable that this
hint will be sufficient, but in case It is
not. General Wade's instructions are
sufficient to meet every . contingency.
He is ordered .to put a stop to these
proceedings without any limitations on
his authority. If necessary there is no
doubt that the principals in the scheme
will be promptly arrested and impris
oned.
According to the terms of the adver
tisement in the case of the Central
Railroad, the concession is to run
ninety-nine years, and under it "the
government," it is stipulated, "will aid
the concessionaire by guaranteeing an
annual interest of 4 per cent on the
capital invested in the lines mentioned,
besides all advantages granted to rail
road companies under the laws of 1R77
and 18S0." The roads are also "gTanted
exemption from import duties on ma
terial necessary' for the construction
and operation of the lines." and also
"free cession of such lands belonging
to the state or to towns as may be
necessary for the construction and ope
ration."
Bidders were required to deposit be
fore bidding the sum of 200.000 pesos in
gold in the Spanish bank in Cuba and
a further sum of 1,000,000 pesos in gold
as a guarantee."
"The treasury of the island of Cuba,"
it is declared, "will pay in gold to the
concessionaire every month the
amounts due on the sections of line in
operation at the rate of interest guar
anteed."

HARCOURT GIVES UP
THE LEADERSHIP
J.'o Longer Willing to Guide the Lib-
eral .Party in the House of
Commons.
LONDON, Dec. 13.â Right Hon. Wil
liam Vernon Harco'urt, Member of Par
liament for West Monmouthshire, and
cinte the resignation of Gladstone the
official leader of the Liberal party in
th" House of Commons, has addressed
a k-tter to John Morley, Liberal mem
ber for Morttroseburgh, announcing his
rpsignation of the leadership. He says:
"The Libpral party, rent by sectional
disputes and personal interests, is one
which no man can consent to lead,
either with credit to himself or advan
taec to the country."
Mr. Morley, in his reply, expresses
Bympathy with Sir William Vernon
Harcourt, and says he is not surprised
at the tatter's decision. Mr. Morley's
reply is a very long and sympathetic
justification of Harcourt's action and
an eulogy of his financial work, public
spirit and zeal for the welfare of his
party.
It is understood that Harcourt will
retain his seat in the House of Com
mons. Lord Rosebery will be inevi
tably Indicated as the. leader of the en
tire Liberal party. His brilliant speech
on the Fashoda incident has settled
that.
As for tho Liberal leadership in the
House of Commons everything points
to Herbert Henry Asqulth, Member for
East Fife and Secretary of ritate for
the Home Department in the Glad-
Btone-Rosebery government, which be
gan with Mr. Gladstone's Premiership
in 1592 and ended under Lord Rose
bery's in lsor>. The affair lends unusual
interest to the conference of the Na
tional Liberal Federation at Birming
ham next Friday. A final decision as
to future leaders will be taken at a
meeting of the Liberal members prior
to the reassembling: of Parliament:

WAR VESSELS ARE
ORDERED TO HAVANA
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â The Brooklyn, Texas, Castine and Res
olute have been ordered to Havana.
While there is not the faintest desire to convey a threat in the
dispatch of these warships to Havana, it may be noted that when
they lie within the harbor they will hold the town In perfect subjec
tion. It is surmised that the suggestion came from Admiral Samp
son, who is now in one of the suburbs of Havana, as a result of the
unfortunate eruption Sunday night at the ' Hotel Ingleterra. At any
event the affray brought the authorities to a sudden realization of the
exact state of affairs in Havana and the imminent danger of another,
such outbreak, which perhaps might run into the proportions of a riot
and cost many innocent lives. With only a small force of American
soldiers in Havana province and those removed at such a distance
from the city as to make it difficult of access in time to be of ser
vice to the American element in the city, now swollen to large pro
portions by the advent of many hundred commercial men and others
seeking opportunities for employment, the necessity for some protec
tion was apparent. To increase the number of soldiers materially is
not easy, in view of the difficulty of transporting them, as well as
providing for them when they reach Cuba, but the navy's motto now
is "Always ready," and it was decided to hasten the ships named to
Havana to form a formidable bulwark aprainst any anarchistic out
breaks that might occur before the completion of the American occu
pation of the city.
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES MEET.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â At the semi-annual meeting of the trustees
of the American University, held here to-day, Hon. William Connell
of Scranton, Pa., presided at the forenoon session and ex-Governor
Pattison at the afternoon. Among those present were Bishop John F. Hurst,
chancellor; Bishop C. C. McCabe. Rev. W. H. Milburn, chaplain of the
United States Senate; Rev. Dr. Payne, corresponding secretary of the Board
of Education of the M. E. Church, and M. G. Emery, treasurer.
The board adopted plans proposed by Bishop McCabe for the organiza
tion of a ministerial alliance, to consist of 1000 preachers, each to secure
$1000 ($1,000,000 in all) for an endowment fund, and also for a woman's guild,
to raise the same amount, making $2,000,000 for the endowment. â¢
The initial steps toward the organization of the alliance were taken by
the election of Bishop Charles H. Fowler of Buffalo, N. V., as president, and
Bishop McCabe as secretary. Mr. C. C. Grover pledged $1000 for the al
liance, payable January 1. Subscriptions to the alliance already have been
made for $25,000.
For the erection of the Pennsylvania Hall of Administration $50,000 also
has been pledged. Dr. W. L. Davidson was elected field secretary, to have
in charge the raising of funds for the erection of the Ohio College of Govern
ment building.
An explanation was made by Henry Ives Cobb of a water-colored
sketch of the grounds and proposed buildings, and also of his elevations of
the Ohio College of Government and the Pennsylvania Hall of Administra
tion buildings.
Thomas W. Smith of Washington; Mrs. E. S. Tome of Fort Deposit,
Md. ; Rev. Dr. Parks Cadman of New York; John E. Duboise of Duboise,
Pa., and Rev. Dr. J. Wesley Hill, were elected trustees.
DEADLY AFFRAY BETWEEN MEMBERS OF A FUNERAL PARTY.
HAVANA, Dec. 13.â About 9 o'clock this morning when a funeral pro
cession, which was escorting the hearse containing the remains of
Jesus Sotolongo, who was killed Sunday night, reached the corner of
Infanta and San Jose streets, a violent affray took place between the
members of the funeral party and some employes of the military hospital.
The following were wounded: Dr. Betancourt, Cuban Deputy for Santiago;
Rafael Portuondo, Cuban Deputy: the Cuban General Vidal; the Cuban
Colonel Rivas. Francisco L,ucas Blanco, a Spaniard; Ramon Garcia, a Span
iard; three women and two children. Garcia, who was stabbed, may die,
and Portuondo was badly hurt.
One version of the affair is that the military hospital employes and a
number of Spanish privates, who were standing in the hospital portico, re
fused to remove their hats when requested to do so by persons in the pro
cession. Thereupon the Cubans, it is alleged, tried to knock off the hats,
and a fight ensued.
The privates fired upon the procession, the windows of the hearse being
broken and bullets striking the coffin. Knives and pistols were freely used.
The procession, which consisted of ISO carriages, continued to the Cuban
camp near Marianao. where military honors were rendered. There were
more than fifty wreaths of flowers from the friends of the dead man and
the procession and ceremonial were virtually a demonstration against the
Hotel Inglaterra outrage.
NINE MEN KILLED BY A FAST EXPRESS TRAIN.
BUFFALO, N. V., Dec. 13.â Nine men were killed and three injured at
Winspure bridge, near Corfu, on the New York Central Railroad, to
day. They were Poles, with the exception of John Warner, their fore
man, who is among the killed. The men were engaged in shoveling snow.
All were frightfully mutilated. The men stepped from the track to avoid an
approaching train right in front of a fast express train running in the same
direction as the first, and were literally ground to pieces.
Engineer Smith of the express, in an interview, said:
"I could see nothing ahead of me, but I thought the place looked bad
and blew my whistle. I had let up on the whistle when I heard my fireman
give a yell. He did not call for brakes, but I slapped on the air the minute
I heard him. He "had seen a man beside the track, though he had not seen
any one struck. A moment after I applied the brakes I saw a man shoot up
into the air on my side of the cab. He was as high as the smokestack when
I saw him. He came down on the freight train, which was running
along on that side, and was carried a mile before he fell off. My
train stopped in about two train lengths, and the sight that I saw
when I got out was the most horrible I have ever witnessed. The
dead and mangled were lying on both sides of the track just
as they had been thrown. I did not see them until after we had struck them.
I did not see them come on the track, and until my fireman yelled I did
not know they were there."
BAILEY OPPOSIS WHEELER'S RIGHT IN THE HOUSE.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â Representative Bailey of Texas has decided
to raise the question of the right of Major General Wheeler to par
ticipate in the proceedings of the House should he attempt to ex
ercise the privilege of a member. He will also raise the question as
against either of three other members of the House who entered the ser
vice in the United States army during the war with Spain â Robbins (R.) of
Pennsylvania, Colson (R.) of Kentucky and Campbell (D.) of Illinois. None
of these members of the House who entered the military service has partici
pated in the proceedings since the session convened, either to introduce
biils or vote upon roll call, but last Saturday General Wheeler attended
the Democratic caucus. As none but Democratic members of Congress are
members of th<* Democratic caucus. Barley says this raises the presumption
that General Wheeler contemplates resuming his seat in the House.
FRENCH DEPUTIES FIGHT A HARMLESS "DUEL"
PARIS, Dec. 13.â M. Antide Boyer, the Radical Socialist Deputy, and M.
Deroulede, the Revisionist Deputy, fought a harmless duel with pis
tols to-day at Tour de Villebon, near Meudon, as an outcome of yes
terday's debate, during which M. Deroulede and M. Gauthie, another Re
visionist Deputy, challenged by M. Boyer, referred to M. Boyer as a "white
washed Panamaist."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1898.
ARGUMENT OE
NICARAGUAN
CANAL PLANS
Senators Are Not in
Accord.
VARIED VIEWS PRESENTED
TTJRPIE STYLES MABITIMIi COM
PANY A FBAUD.
Morgan Opposes a Motion to Delay
Consideration of the Bill and
Scores the Grace Syn
dicate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. lJâ To-day's
session of the Senate was largely con
sumed in discussing the Nicaragua
canal bill. Turpie made the principal
speech in opposition to the bill, at
tacking it on the ground that it is in
the interest of the Maritime Canal
Company, which he characterized as a
fraud and bankrupt. He moved a post
ponement of the matter until after the
holiday recess. Morgan defended the
bill and the Maritime Company and
opposed the motion to postpone. Berry
and Rawlins both offered amendments
materially aff.cting the bill.
Previous to the proceedings upon the
canal bill, Morrill made an address in
support of the bill authorizing the pur
chase of a site for a Supreme Court
building, and this and several other
bills were passed.
Berry gave notice of an amendment that
he will offer to the Nicaragua canal bill
providing for the direct appropriation of
money for the construction of the canal
and limiting the cost to $115,000,000. The
amendment provides for the construction
of the canal by the Maritime Company
and gives the Government a lien upon the
property to be foreclosed under circum
stances" fully enumerated. Berry stated
the object of the amendment to be to eli
minate the bond feature of the bill. An
other amendment was intended to deprive
the Maritime Canal Company of any
shares of the stock, leaving the United
States, Nicaragua and Costa Rica the
only stockholders.
Rawlins also gave notice of an amend
ment to the Nicaragua bill, providing that
the act should not go into effect until the
Government should secure by treaty the
right to fortify and garrison the canal, to
send armed vessels and munitions of war
through it in time of war, and to close
it against any other nation with which
the I'nited States may be at war.
Turpie CD.) of Indiana then addressed
the Senate on the Nicaragua canal bill,
saying that no one could excel him in zeal
in advocating the Isthmian canal, but
while he saw the vast advantage of the
proposed waterway, he was also fully
aware of the difficulties in the way of
putting the plan for a canal into execu
tion. iVhile not opposed to the canal as
such, he was opposed to the scheme of
the Maritime Canal Company and he de
nounced that company as the moat ven
omous and effective opponent of a real
canal enterprise. lie did not believe it
possible for +hat company, with its bad
odor, to construct the canal, and he held
that the Maritime Company should get
out of the way of the genuine canal en
terprise. He developed this line of attack
at length, denouncing it as a scheme of
confiscation, the object of the Maritime
Company being, he declared, not to cut a
canal, but to "cut a channel of communi
cation at the least possible cost between
the Treasury of the United States and
the empty coffers of that beggarly corpo
ration."
Turpie asserted that the Government
could not lawfully guarantee the Marl
time Company's bonds us proposed. The
case was not parallel to the Pacific rail
road companies, as in those cases the
bonds were made directly payable to the
companies. As to the possibility of for
eign jealousy operating to prevent the
construction of the canal by this Govern
ment. Turpie declared that there was no
civi.ized nation that would not be pleased
to see the canal constructed. The Mari
time Company had been guilty of innum
erable frauds, but even if it had not, he
would not support the pending- bill, be
cause of the failure to provide for the
ownership of the canal by the United
States. All obstacles would disappear
before a movement on the part of the
United States to construct the canal. The
opposition of Nicaragua and other coun
tries was made to the Maritime Corn
pan and to it only, of whose "vapid, I
empty and thoroughly groundless preten- I
sions the Government of Nicaragua had
evidently become tired."
Turpie renewed his plea for a postpone
ment of the question until the Nicaragua
Canal Commission should report. He
said he had favored the appointment of
this commission because he knew that no
commission could report in favor of the
Maritime Company as he did not believe
the present commission had. Information
was wanted on the three points of feasi
bility, time and expense, and che Senalv.
had a right to this information before
acting upon the bill. Turpie closed for
the day with a motion for postponement
of further consideration of the bill until I
January 10, by which time the report of
the commission would be received.
Morgan antagonized the motion, plead
ing for the continuation of the debate,
saying there were many points connected I
with the enterprise upon which light could '
not possibly be thrown by the Walker re- i
port. He denied that the Maritime Com- |
pany had ever applied to the United
States for assistance, but, on the otner i
hand, the application had been made to
them because they owned the only con
cession. He declared in answer to a sug
gestion from Turpie that it would never I
be possible to get an agreement binding
the United States, Nicaragua and Costa
Rica because of Costa Rica's suspicion
of Nicaragua. Costa Rica knew perfectly j
well that Nicaragua was desirous of <
nothing so much as the downfall of Costa
Rica. He spoke of Costa Rica's "bar
gain counter" in the matter of granting ;
concessions, and when Turpie interrupted
him with the statement that this was not
an expression of amity toward Nicaragua I
ho retorted that Turpie was growing sen
timental on the subject. He declared mat
Grace's purpose in getting a new con
tract was not to build a canal, but to i
own itâ to hold up the Government. He I
denounced this concession as a "rascally j
contract." Grace had called on him
twice in one day without being Invited I
and had urged the abandonment of Gov
ernment aid. In reply to a question from
him Grace had said he expected to Â°ret
his money to build the canal from Lon- i
don. This fact showed where we were j
drifting, and was there a Senator who
would be willing to see the canal placed
under the control of foreigners?
The Senate at 5 o'clock went into ex
ecutive session, and at 5:15 p. m. ad
journed.
PITHY CORRESPONDENCE
RELATING TO THE CANAL
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â At the
opening of the debate on the Nicaragua
canal bill in the Senate to-day Senator
Morgan had read a letter from the Sec
retary of State, transmitting Minister
Merry's statement of his representa
tions to President Zelaya of Nicaragua
concerning the canal concessions and
also a communication made by Hon. W.
R. Grace in behalf of the syndicate
which has recently obtained a conces
sion from Nicaragua in antagonism to
the Maritime Company. The letter of
Minister Merry to Secretary Hay says:

the canal speculators had beÂ«n signed,
but fully one day before the Nicaraguan
Congress, that was specially called to
confirm it. passed upon it favorably. I
am informed that it is an option of one
year only, but hope soon to Bend you more
precise information In reference thereto.
In a letter dated San Jose, Costa
Rica, October 28, 1898, to General Ze
laya, President of Nicaragua, Minister
Merry said:
I have the honor to advise that I have
this <luy received the following cable
from the Government of the United
States: "You will recognize the great ex
pediency of continuing the present status
of the Nicaraguan canal question until
Congress shall have had opportunity to
act and remonstrate against any arrange
ments which may substitute new condi
tions for those now existing." Under
these instructions I have to-day tele
graphed the United States Consul at
Managua, requesting him to present the
remonstrance of the United Stutes Gov
ernment against any change of the con
ditions connected with the Nicaragua
canal concession. I trust that your ex
cellency will decide, in the interests of
the country which entrusts its destinies
to your able and patriotic guidance to
accede to the policy herein suggested, so
important to the future development and
prosperity of Nicaragua and as due to
the friendly relations between your excel
lency's government and that of the Uni
ted States, which it has been my special
endeavor to promote. I may be permitted
to add my personal assurances of a sin
cere desire to use every honorable in
fluence to assure your excellency of the
proud record of important and patriotic
aid in opening the ocean highway for the
world's commerce through beautiful Nic
aragua.
The letter of William R. Grace is
dated December 2, 1898, and after as
serting that the Cardenas-Menocal con
cession had been forfeited and that the
concession granted Eyre and Cragin
would be effective in October, says:
The syndicate is satisfied that it will be
able to secure money to complete the
canal. It holds that the canal is an en
terprise from which private capital should
not be eliminated, but respecting the
opinion of those who fear having such a
highway in private hands, the syndicate
Is willing to arrange a basis on which
the United States Government would con
trol the tariffs, and participate in the
management of the canal.
Grace submits the following terms:
The Inter-Oceanic Canal Company to
be organized under a State charter,
capital to be $100,000,000, with the right
to issue mortgage bonds to the amount
of $150,000,000 at 4 per cent, and a sink
ing fund of one-half of 1 per cent after
twenty years; the United States Gov
ernment to guarantee interest at 3 per
cent on $50,000,000 of the mortgage in
debtedness, taking a second, mortgage
as security, the guarantee not to be
given until the company has invested
$1,000,000 in the enterprise; the Govern
ment can appoint five directors of a
board of fifteen; the syndicate will con
sent to the disbursement of the money
raised upon the Government guarantee,
to be subject to audit by the Govern
ment.
In conclusion Grace says the syndi
cate is desirous of meeti-ng the wishes
of the President in every possible way
and to allay the. fears of people who
think the great work should not be left
to uncontrolled private management.

ARE LEGALLY TRACED TO THIS CITY
The Prosecution of Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin Has Reached a Criti=
cal Stage.
Physicians Tell a Dramatic Story of
the Murder of the Two
Women.
The prosecutors of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin
are proceeding slowly, cleverly and delib
erately in the presentation of the facts
that they believe will prove the accused
MEN OF THE LEGAL AND OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WHO PLAYED PROMINENT PARTS IN THE DOVER TRAGEDY.
The prosecution in the case of Mrs. Botkin has not as yet mentioned the name of the accused woman, It has confined
its efforts to a demonstration of the fact that a double murder was committed at Dover, Delaware, and that the instru
ments of death were brought to this city by Delaware authorities. The officers of State will now begin their attempt and
seek to prove that Mrs. Botkin is guilty of the crime.
woman the author of the horrifying
crimes that were committed at the little
town of Dover, Delaware. On the liryt
day that evidence was presented the offi
cers of State submitted testimony to show
that a terrible murder had been commit
ted at Dover. Every incident that was
associated with the presentation and the
use of the box of poisoned candy by the
murdered women was exploited before
the jury. The saddened relatives and
friends of the dead women told their
ftory, and when court convened yesterday
morning the grief-stricken, v-engeance
â¢eeklng father of the victims was on the
witne^-Mand to conclude his recital.
He finished his story rind then the pub
lic prosecutors took up the thread of their
proof. They produced the physicians who
attended the stricken women, and drew
from them a new story of {he cruel
crime. The story of death and desolation
waÃ told with such dramatic effect that

sides.
I hundreds of men and women inevitably
turned toward the little dark-eyed, dark
â  skinned woman who is accused of the
crime. Mrs. Botkin endured the ordeal
quietly, almost insolently. She looked in
dolently, languidly at the crowd and then
at the officers of the law who were lead
ing her to the point of defense. She
seemed forcibly composed, and there were
few in the courtroom of Judge Cook who
wondered why.
The physicians traced in painful detail
the death agony of the murdered women.
Every act and movement of the victims
of the poisoner were recounted with calm
deliberation. The torture and suspense
of days, with the culminating horror of
death, were pictured as one might repre
sent the horrors of a mental dissecting
room. And when the recital was 'over
hundreds of eyes were turned upon the
woman who is accused of having caused
the suffering and death that came to a
household. Mrs. Botkin never flinched.
Her eyes were as languid as if she were
listening to some uninteresting tale that
did not affect her.
The story of the physicians was, after
all, practically incidental. They had
much that was material to offer, but their
proof that a crime had been committed at
Dover was largely corroborative of what
had been eaid before. The proceedings
had already shown that two women had
been murdered. The critical issue for the
officers of State was to show that the au
thor of the crime sent the instruments of
death from this city, and that the accused
woman is the person' who should pay the
legal penalty for the crime.
The logical theory ef the prosecution
was then continued. The fact of a mur
der at Dover had been proven so far as i
the evidence of the State could prove it.
The prosecutors then sought to trace th^
inception of that crime to this city. Be
fore the proceedings were over yesterday
the officers of the State had shown that i
the box of poisoned candy and all it con-i

taUied was sent from this city to Dover.
After the victims of the murderer were
dead the instruments of death were col
i lected and given into the custody of the
State officers of Delaware. Witnesses
j rebued on the stand how this process was
I accomplished. The Attorney General of
Delaware told h<3w he received the box of
poisoned candy, the handkerchief, the
note and the letters. The State detective
of Delaware related how he received the
dreadful exhibits and carried them across
the continent to this city. Chief of Po
lice Lees testified how he received the
grewÃome records of a monstrous crime.
The prosecutors had shown the commis
sion of a terrible offense and had asked
the jury to follow them from Delaware to
this city. It is now their purpose to pre
sent their evidence againsi Mrs. Botkin
and to show as far as their evidence will
permit that It was she who prepared tne
box of poisoned candy and pent it from
this city through the mails.
The first witness on the stand yesterday
was John B. Fennington, the father of
the murdered women. He was called for
cross-examination, which resulted In
nothing- material. T'nder re-direct exami
nation, however, the prosecution elicited
an important assertion. Mr Pennington
d dared that he never had. so far a
recalled, a quarrel with a servant In his
household. This met the insinuation of
the defense that Mrs. Dunning and Mrs.
Deane may have been killed by a servant.
l'ennlngton was followed on the witness
stand by Dr. R. A. H. Bishop, the family
physician who attended Mrs. Deane and
Mrs. Dunning until consultation became a
necessity. Dr. Bishop related, as already
i: dicated, the dreadful story of the Buf
fering and death of his two patients. The j
recital was painfully dramatic. Dr. Bish
op was sharp, precise, incisive. But when
it came to the cross-examination of At
torney Knight the physician fell by the
I wayside. He admitted that in the final
analysis his great proof that the women
or Dover died from arsenic was given to
him by the State Analyist of Delaware
Dr. T. R. Wolf. This was a great point
for the defense, but Dr. P. 8. Downs, the
consulting physician at the buskin of
Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane shook it.
He declared that at no time was\tnei-e a
doubt 1 in his mind that the murdered
men . were poisoned by arsenic. This as
sertion'could not be disturbed. The de
on,se, , ad L sought to raise a doubt and
had failed. Knight had brought Bishop
knn^ po n l ?h? h Â£ T * the Physician did not
know what ha had signed in his certificate
of death. He* had gone even farther and
old not know whether or not he had
signed a death certificate
ÂP, r - t< Downs had helped to save the
situation and when he concluded Knight
remarked that every Incident that had
been described had happened in Dover,
Delaware. The remark raised the shadow
of that doubt of State jurisdiction which

Dr. T. R. .Wolf, the State Chemist of
Delaware, related the incidents of his
chemical examination of the candy sent
from this city. His story was thorough
and. critical enough to frighten Knight
into silence. The exposition of the physi
cian might have been a lecture on quali
tative and quantitative analysis before a
class of college students. Knight breathed
a sigh of relief ..when the discussion re
turned to candy. He then asked Dr Wolf
if he could tell whether or not the poison
had, been placed in the candies before or
after the chocolate coating was put on
Dr. Wolf could not tell and the courtroom
knew that another victory, however
small, had been won for the defense.
The witnesses who traced the candy and
its accompaniments back to this city were
then placed on the stand and. the trial was
suspended until this morning.
- When court opened in v the morning
Judge Cook; explained that the official
stenographer was ill -, and that -he had
sworn in J. C. Mulligan, who would act in !
his stead. John B. Pennington was called
â  to the stand and his cross-examination
: was continued by Attorney Knight for the
. defense. The witness was on the stand
i but a few minutes, the questions asked
, him relating to his disposal of the box
of candy containing the. deadly poison. He
j testified that he had never examined the
! bonbons closely, in fact had never touched
i them. The only apparent change in their
appearance was that they now appeared
! mure dried up than they were when he
looked at them in Delaware. The box was
in his custody all the time, except when
i the Coroner had it during the progress of
I the inquest.
In reply to Mr. Hosmer of the prosecu
tion the witness said the Coroner had the
box but an hour. He also testified that
Mr. lVnnington was not ill and that he
had never had any trouble with his em
; ployes. Mr. Hosmer tried to trace the
i third anonymous letter. The witness only
kn.w what his daughter had told him
about it, y and upon Mr. Knight's objec
tion this was ruled out. Mr. Hosmer
Btated that he believed the information
j material to tfie cafii , and he reserved the
' right to recall the witness later. Upon
' this he was excused, being: granted per
mission to Remain in the courtroom.
Dr. K. A. H. Bishop, the physician who
attended the two murdered women during
their illness, next took the stand. He
testified that he was a graduate of Penn
sylvania College, and had been practicing
since 1875 in Dover. lie had been called
on the morning of August 10 to attend
Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane at the
home of the Penningtons. He saw Mrs.
Deane lirst as she was suffering more
than her sister. Mr. Knight "biected to
testimony regarding Mrs. Deane, saying
they were charged witli the murder
(if Mrs. Dunning. The objection was over
ruled and the question was continued.
The doctor described the symptoms of his
patients as being severe pains accom
panied with an intense thirst. He stayed
at the house throughout the day, but
couM not allay the vomiting which was
the chief symptom of their - .ness. He
also prescribed for the boy and girl, who
! were suffering from the same causes ap
parently, but in a lesser de-ree. He gave
morphine to allay pain and fed his pa
tients on mucilaginous drinks. The fol- '
lowing morning (Thursday) he returned
to the house, and found that they had
taken eppnog and had breakfasted on
crackers and coffee. With the exception
of Airs. Deane they showed improvement,
one had a feeble pulse, cold extremities
and occasional nausea, finding it difficult
to retain anything on her stomach. Later
in the afternoon he was summoned hur
riedly, and found her in a state of total
collapse, of which she had all the char
acteristic symptoms. Her expression was I
anxious and worried and she complained
of pains in her head.
Her pulse grew gradually weaker. The j
anxious look became intensified. The
coldness Jn her extremities crept gradu
ally on. Her lifts grew purple, showing
all the symptoms of arsenical poisoning. !
In reply to a question the witness said i
he believed that to be the causr of death.
He knew from the condition of his pa- I
tient that the end was not far off, and he 'â 
| stayed at her side until she died. Mrs.
Dunning entered her sister's room shortly
before she died, but was compelled to lie
down. Late that ni^ht he was called,
and dressing hurriedly went to the Pen- i
nington house. Mrs. Dunning was asleep,
but all her symptoms were against her.
She woke up and seeing the doctor
asked: "Why are you here? lam all i
right."
The doctor told her he was passing and
dropped in. At that time hor feet and i
hands and nose were cold and her pulse I
was weak. In the morning these symp- '
toms were more marked. The heart ac
tion was much weaker, the pulse could '
be counted, but it was vpry weak. Early !
in the uprning Mr. Pennington asked if ;
Dr. Bishop would like another physician i
summoned in consultation, and upon his !
answering in the affirmative Dr. Downs i
was called. The doctors consulted and I
JURISDICTION OF THE SUPERIOR
COURT REMAINS UNDECIDED
IRREGULARITIES inherent in the mode of procedure have resulted in the denial by the Supreme Court
of the application made by W. L. Harper for a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Cook continuing with
the trial of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin. The petition was presented for the consideration of the Supreme
Court several days ago, but, through some misunderstanding, it could not be orderly considered by that
'tribunal immediately upon its presentment. Monday, notwithstanding the fact the file mark did not ap
pear on the document, the petition was taken up and considered by the entire court in consultation.
At that time it was decided to deny the application of Mr. Harper, but the final order to this effect was
not made until the stamp had been affixed. This was done yesterday, and the order denying the petition en
tered upon the records.
By reason of the denial of this petition a question of vital importance in the trial of Mrs. Botkin, and
one of consuming interest to the bar and hosts of laymen, remains undecided â the question of the jurisdic
tion of the Superior Court to try Mrs. Botkin, and the validity and scope of section 27 of the Penal Code, un
der which the trial of the alleged poisoner is being had.
"No written opinion was handed down in the denial of the petition presented by W. L.. Harper," said
Justice Van Fleet last evening, "by reason that the matter was not one requiring an opinion, a simple denial
of the petition sufficing. The denial of the petition in no way determines, decides or affects the jurisdiction
of the court before which Mrs. Botkin is now being tried. Neither does it determine the scope of section 27
of the Penal Code, under which the trial is being had.
"The petition was denied by reason of irregularities inherent in the mode of procedure pursued by the pe
titioner to determine the jurisdiction of the court in the premises. Mr. Harper's application for a writ of pro
hibition could not properly be considered by the court, as it was not and could not be considered a part or
portion of the subject-matter of the case. For these reasons the points on which a decision was sought still
remain undecided, and will not be decided until properly placed before the Supreme Court for consideration."
prescribed for her, but despite their ef
forts she died that evening. All her
symptoms were the same as those of Mrs
Deane. Replying to Mr. Hosmer, the wit
ness said he believed it was arsenical
poisoning; he had no doubt about it, as

all the symptoms indicated it.
Dr. Bishop did not see the box of candy
until the Monday on which the women
Were buried. He then called upon Mr.
P< nning ton to ask that an inquest be
held. Mr. Pennington agreed and then
gave the doctor five pieces of candy
which he said he would take to Dr. Wolf,
the chemist, to have analyzed.
The doctor then detailed at length his
trip to Newark, the home of the chemist.
He saw him and stated the circum
stances of the poisoning, which Dr. Wolf
said he knew of through the papers. He
said it would take several days to make
the necessary tests, but was told that if
he looked for arsenic he would find it at
once. Dr. Wolf made his tests and re
turned with Dr. Bishop that night to
Dover, where the Inquest was held. When
they met on the train Dr. Wolf said:
"Here's your analysis; it shows any
quantity of arsenic." The witness testi
fied that the particles of arsenic he ex
amined that night were hard like por
celain and would not dissolve like the
powdered arsenic; in fact, would be dif
ficult to dissolve. Dr. Bishop was then
turned over to Attorney Knight, who sub
jected him to the most severe cross ex
amination of any witness yet on the
stand.
In reply to questions he said he was
not familiar with the use of the micro
scope, its use was not taught extensively
when he went to school. He did not re
member to what cause he attributed the
death of the women in the death certifi
cates nor did he remember signing such
instruments at all. He said the analy
sis of the candy confirmed his suspicions
that the women had died of arsenical
poisoning. At first he thought it might be
! ptomaine poisoning and that the germs
1 were generated by the heat of the mail
; bags. After some further questioning on
'. the germ theory he said he had never
1 studied microscopy and preferred not to
igo into a discussion of the subject. He
i said the distinction between crystal ar
j senic and powdered arsenic was marked.
'It was porcelain arsenic in the candy.
When asked as to the first symptoms of
arsenical poisoning he said they varied
according to the kind of arsenic used. ,
Fowler's solution would act in twenty j
minutes and would show all the symp- ;
toras of arsenical poisoning. Powdered \
arsenic would take longer, while the lump |
arsenic would take possibly two days.
The question whether life would have
been saved if the stomach pump had been
used was objected to. The candy was j
taken in the evening and gradually i
worked Its way into the intestinal canal. |
None remained on the stomach. j
The symptoms of the patients differed ,
from those present in cholera morbus,
and the physician abandoned that theory
early on the first day he was called to
attend the women. He administered mor
phine not as an antidote but to allay the
pain. He first learned of the arsenic poi
soning on his second visit to Mrs. 'Deane,
too late to save her life. On being asked
as to its being good practice to give
whisky and ammonia he replied In the
affirmative, as he wanted to tide them
over the dangerous period, knowing he '
could not neutralize the poison. On
Wednesday Mrs. Deane said to him:
"There is no cholera morbus here. We
had candy last night; chocolate cara
mels." That was the beginning of his
search for poison. Notwithstanding this
he did not see the box with the candy un
til the following Tuesday. He did not
learn, definitely that arsenic was the poi
sonous agent until the report of the chem
ist that the candy contained arsenic. On
being asked If he testified before the Cor
oner's jury that he leaned toward the ac
cident theory and did not believe it was
arsenic, he replied he did not remember.
Although he knew the family all his life
he did not remember what he put in the
death certificate. He was a busy man
and could not recall how many certificates
were made out or when or where they
were made out. It was at his suggestion
that the Coroner's inquest was held.
Mr. Pennington objected at first, as his
wife was ill. It was shown him. there
would be no repulsive features. The
bodies hiid been embalmed, so no autopsy
could be held with satisfaction to any
body. He suggested an Inquest to deter
mine absolutely the cause of death. On
being asked if he would swear to the
cause without the analysis he replied in
the affirmative. He thought it a myste
rious case and he wanted a public in
quiry.
He was sure there was arsenic In the
candy after Mrs. Deane died. When the
women died he could not reconcile the
deaths with anything but arsenical poi
soning. He did not know why a post mor
tem examination had not been made. It
was the Coroner's duty, and would have
been the absolute test as to the cause of
death. To Mr. Hosmer he said the bodies
were embalmed in arsenic. Although it
would leave the body in a different condi
tion to that if the subject had died of
poisoning, "the ingenuity of an opposing
attorney could break down the expert
testimony." Mr. Knight thought witness
was criticizing him. and entered a vigor
ous objection to his remarks. Witness
apologized, saying he did not have Mr
Knight in mind when he spoko. He left
the stand glad to escape further trouble

em portions the rainfp.ll was heavy. Cool
weather accompanied the rain and in the
higher valleys the rain changed to snow,
which covered the ground. The snow
melted gradually and left the soil in tine
condition for cultivation. The rain was
of great benefit to the farming Interests
and will permit the resumption of gen
eral farm work in those sections where
the precipitation was generous. Consid
erable dry Beedlng had been done previous
to the rain and the probability is that a
large acreage will now be put into culti

AND HALF VASSAL.
The Very Foundation on Which It
Rests If. Assaulted When It Is

Social Dispatch to The Call.
SAVANNAH, Dec. 13.â Colonel Wil
liam J. Bryan, upon leaving his com
mand to-day, the Third Nebraska,
gave jut the following interview:
My leason for leaving the army was set i
forth in my letter to the adjutant general j
tendering my resignation. Now that the i
treaty of peace has been concluded I be- j
lieve that 1 can be more useful to my
country as a civilian than as a soldier.
Colonel Bryan then proceeded to the
discussion of public questions, saying:
The people of the United States, having I
rescued Cuba from foreign control, may I
now resume the discussion of the domes
tic problems which confront this nation |
and to the consideration of the new ques
tions arising out of the wax.
I may be in error, but in my judgment
our nation is In greater danger Just now |
than Cuba. Our people defended Cuba I
against foreign arms; nnw they must de- (
fend themselves and their country against I
a foreign ideaâ the colonial idea of Euro
pean nations. Heretofore greed has per- j
verted the Government and used its in- I
strumental interference for private gain; I
but now the very inundation principles of ;
our Government are assailed.
The imperialistic idea is directly antag
onistic to the idea and ideals which have
been cherished by the American people
since the signing of the Declaration of ,
Independence. Our nation must give up
any intention of entering upon a colonial :
policy (such as is now pursued by Euro
pean countries), or it must abandon the |
doctrine that governments derive their
Just powers from the consent of the gov
erned.
We may believe that governments come
up from the people, or we may believe j
that governments come down to the peo- |
pie from those who possess the heaviest i
cannons and the largest ships, but we
cannot advocate both doctrines.
To borrow a Bible quotation, "A house
divided against itself cannot stand"; j
paraphrasing Lincoln's declaration. I may j
add that this nation cannot endure half
republic and half colonyâ half free and |
half vassal. Our form of government.
even traditions, our present interests and
our future welfare, all forbid our enter
ing upon a career of conquest.
Jefferson has bien quoted in support of
imperialism, but our opponents must dip- ]
tinguish between expansion in the West
ern Hemisphere and an expansion that !
involves us in the quarrel of Europe and
the Orient. They must still further dis
tinguish between expansion which secures
contiguous territory for future settlement {
and expansion which secures us alien
races for future subjugation.
Jefferson favored the annexation of ne- i
cessary contiguous territory on the North j
American continent, but he was opposed
to wars of conquest and expressly con
demned the acquiring of remote terri
tory.
When asked how the colonial policy
could be prevented. Colonel Bryan said:
R'-'me think that the fight should be
made against ratification of the treaty,
but I would prefer another plan. If the
treaty is rejected negotiations must be
renewed and instead of settling the ques
tion according to our ideas, we must set
tle It by diplomacy, with the possibility
of international complications. It will be
easier. I think, to end the war at once
by ratifying the treaty, and then deal
with the subject In our own way. The
issue can be presented directly by "a reso
lution of Congress declaring the policy of
the nation upon this subject. The Presi
dent in his message says that our only
purpose in taking possession of Cuba is
to establish a stable government and then
turn that government 0%-er to the people
of Cuha. Congress could reaffirm this pur
pose in regard to Cuba and assert the
same purpose in regard to the Philippines
and Porto Rico. Such a resolution would
make a clearcut issue between the doc
trine of self-government and the doctrine
of imperialism. We should reserve a har
bor and coaling station in Porto nico and
the Philippines in return for services ren
dered, ana I think we would be justified
in asking the same concession from Cuba.
In the case of Porto Rico, where the
people have as yet expressed no desire
for an independent government, we might
with propriety declare our willingness to
annex the island if the citizens desire an
nexation: but the Philippine islands are
too far away and their people too differ
ent from ours to be annexed to the United
States, even if they desired it.
Colonel Bryan leaves Savannah to
night for Washington, and will arrive
there Wednesday evening. He Intends
to enter actively into the fight against
the colonial policy.

Social Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 13.â Edward Smith
and William McCarthy, two ex-convicts.
who have been confined in the County
Jail on a charge of misdemeanor in hav
ing endeavored to smuggle opium into
San Quentin Prison, made a break for
liberty while being taken to Judge Rod
den's court for trial this morning. After
an exciting chase they were recaptured
by Constable Louis Hughes.
Constable Hughes had started with
them for Judge Rodden's court. On the
way he saw his Honor on the other side
of the street and hailed him. Judge Rod
den halted and the officer walked across
the street to speak with him. This was
the opportunity for which the two prison
ers had been waiting, and they started to
run, Smith heading up C street and Mc-
Carthy down.
Hughes first gave chase to the former
and overhauled him on Fifth avenue.
Leaving him in the custody of Constable
Gannon he went after McCarthy, who
was found hiding near the narrow gauge
depot. The two were then brought before
the court and pleaded guilty to the
charges preferred against them. They
were lined $150 each, with the alternative
of five months in jail. Not possessing the
coin they had to return to durance vile.
Smith, who is only 23 years old, made a
pitiful plea for leniency. With tears run
ning down his cheeks he begged the court
to remember his youth and give him an
uther chance. He also took advantage of
the opportunity to "roast" Warden Hale.
"If the Warden paid half as much at
tention to the young men on the inside of
the prison as he does those on the out
side," Smith declared. "I would not be
placed in the disgraceful position in which
you see* me, and many another young fel
low would not be sent away from San
Quentin Prison a moral and a physical
wreck. When I went into prison I was in
the best of health, but acquired the habit
of v.-ing opium, and now see what I am.
I hey can say all they want to about the
small quantity of opium inside the walls
of that awful hole, but I know what I
am talking about when I declare that
there is enough of the drug there now
tor every one that uses it to have all he
wants if he knows how to get it, and
there always has been so long as I was
in coniinement."
Smith s stricture on the Warden does
not exactly meet with the approval of
those who claim to know the facts. War
den Hale has done all in his power to
prevent opium getting into the prison.
bu * il: , is suspected that there are other
officials in whom the Warden places trust
?&n* C tÂ°i! lId * *Â«' l m a &ood deal more

AGED WOMAN PERISHES IN FIRE
Burned to Ireath in Seeking to Rescue
a Child Already Saved.
FRESNO, Dec. 13.-Rebecoa Gillespie,
an old colored woman, was burned to
death at midnight In a fire beyond the
city limits. She had entered the blazing
house to save a grandchild, but was over
come by the heat and smoke, and, falling
across the baby's empty bod. perished Of
Jilt remains nothing was found this morn
ing except the charred trunk. She was a
native of Tennessee, about 50 years of
age. The child had been rescued before
the old lady entered the building.
INSTRUMENTS OF THE
POISONER'S MALICE
Continued From Fourth Page.
Mr. Knight asked him upon cross-ex
amination if he hart seen whether the
candies had been opened and pasted to
gether again to permit of the insertion
of the arsenic. This was objected to, as
the witness was not a candy maker. The
objection was withdrawn, and the witness
said he did not know how it got there
He did not find crystallized arsenic, but
found porcelaineoua arsenic. This is the
pulverized or amorphous arsenic, so
called because it is without crystals. On
being asked as to the size of the" lumps he
had seen he said to Mr. Knight that some
were as big as his head. "Oh! but you
don"t know how big my head is at times "
was the rejoinder. The witness was ex
cused after some questions by Mr. Hos
mer.
At this time Judge. Cook made the fol
lowing statement to Attorney Hosmer:
Mr. Hosmer, in addition to the
reasons I gave you in sustaining the
objection to the question asked as to
the law of tae State of Delaware re
lating to murder, I call your atten
tion to the case of the People versus
Tibbits (Ninety-FirsL California), in
which the Supreme Court of this State
held that when, a crime was commit
ted partly in one State and partly in
another it is not necessary to prove
the laws of the other State.
Attorney General R. C. White was the
next witness. Attorney Hosmer found
it difficult to frame a question to intro
duce the murder that waa acceptable to
Mr. Knight. He finally succeeded and
asked briefly about the candy. Witness
was turned over to Mr. Knight for cross
examination. Tie asked, "You're feeling
pretty well to-day, General?" The latter
replied "Yes, sir." "That is all," was the
rr-jolnder.
Detective McVey and Chief Lees were
the last witnesses. They traced the candy
and the handkerchief from the time the
inquest was over until they were pro
duced in the courtroom. The. trial will
go on this morning.
MAY PAY NOVEMBER SALARIES
A Possibilty That Warrants Will Be
Signed at To-Day's Meeting
of the Board.
If the plan that was yesterday consid
ered by the School Directors carries the
teachers will after all pet their Novem
ber salaries. Despite thp fact that the
Directors are Inclined to feel bitter over
what they term the hasty action of the
teachers in going to law before they fully
understood the intentions of the board; a
majority of them were yesterday in favor
of signing the November demands and
putting them in such shape that they
may be paid out of the funds that wiil
be credited to the December account of
the department.
If the board sticks to this proposition
the November warrants will need only Su
perintendent Webster's signature to make
them payable at the treasury. Auditor
Broderiok will audit them to the extent
of the funds to the credit of the board at
the end of the present month. Express
ing himself upon the present state of af
fairs a day or so ago, he said: "It is
not optional with mo whether I shall sign
the warrants of teachers or of the mer
chants. Whichever accounts Mr. Web
ster signs it is my duty to audit, so long
as they are within the provisions of the
one-twelfth act. I cannot discriminate
in favor of either class of creditors. The
whole problem is In the hands of Super
intendent Webster. If he wants to save
the teachers by auditing their bills in
preference to those of the merchants he
can do so, and when they come down to
me I will be obliged to audit ttuun, so
long as tney are legal."

REOPENS THE CONTEST
FOR PARKER'S FORTUNE
Lizzie Sykes Files a Will Similar to
That Which Has Just Been
Set Aside.
SAN JOSE. Dec. 13.â The long and bitter
contest over the $300,000 estate left by
George H. Parker, the eccentric old capi
talist, who died in this city in 1893, was
given a fresh start to-day by the filing
of another will. This was an unexpected
move and came just at the time when
Mrs. Emma L. Parker, the contestant
and widow of Edward L. Parker, thought
she had her case won.
The will filed to-day Is accompanied by
a petition from Lizzie Sykes asking for
its probate. The instrument is dated Oc
tober 15. 1892. It is very similar to the
will set aside yesterday by Judge Hyland
on the ground that G. H. Parker had
been unduly Influenced in its making.

This was executed on July 6, 1893, nearly
a year later than the one just filed.
The â¢will filed to-day makes exactly
the same provision for Edward L. Parker,
the son who died a few weeks after his
father, as the other one. The Parker
block, at 1122 Market -street, San Fran
cisco, was held in trust for him. The
son was to receive the income from the
property during- the life of his wife, but
should she die he was to receive the prop
erty in fee. In case Edward Parker died
flrst, one half of the entire estate of G. H.
Parker at his death should go to Jane
Pomeroy, a sister; of the remainder $5000
was given to the First I'nitarian Church
of San Jose and $5000 to the Home of Ben
evolence. All the remainder was given
in fee to Marshall Pomeroy.
Under these provisions Mrs. Parker re
ceived nothing from her father-in-law's
estate and consequently began a contest.
V. D. Moody. C. E. Wilson and J. R.
Patton are named as trustees.

DR. DODGE'S BILLBOARD.
BY a vote of II to I the Board of Supervisors on
Monday overruled Mayor Phelan's veto of a
resolution granting an advertising firm permis
sion to erect a high fence at the intersection of Va
lencia and Market streets for bill-sticking purposes.
Supervisor Dodge. Assessor-elect, championed the
fence and apologized to the Mayor for using the moral
force of his prospective patronage against him in the
board. The effect of Dodge's influence was seen in
the fact that but one Supervisor stood by the Mayor
in his attempt to prevent the establishment of a dan
gerous and unsightly nuisance.
It will not do to expect much from defeated Super
in the last days of their term, but the public
had a right to assume that the present board, not
withstanding its character, would decline to extend the
area of the bill board nuisance. Especially will it be
disappointed to learn that Dr. Dodge, reform Super
visor and Assessor-elect, is engaged in furthering the
interests of an advertising firm, which is one of a
number that disfigure the city and render pedestrian
ism dangerous.
Some weeks ago the board showed signs of a dis
position to regulate the bill boards. An ordinance
was introduced limiting the height of the signs and
imposing a license upon them. At present they are
recognized as dangerous, and it is well known that,
though competing with all forms of legitimate adver
tising, they pay no taxes whatever. But nothing has
been heard from this ordinance since the bill board
men called on the committee and "explained" person
ally why it would not be a good thing to license and
regulate them.
The sentiment of the Supervisors toward the nui
sance is now made conspicuous by their action upon
Dr. Dodge's enterprise. They overruled a veto by
an almost unanimous vote â Rottanzi alone voting to
sustain the Mayor. Evidently the public may antici
pate no legislation from this board upon the subject.
If anything is done with the tall and unsightly signs
it will have to be done by the Supervisors who will on
January 2 take the places of the present aggregation
of solons.
Beyond question something should be done with
these advertising fences. Their height ought to be
regulated and their owners should be made to pay a
license. In some localities they should be prohibited
altogether, being dangerous on windy days and a foul
ruisance during rainstorms. We bespeak for the mat
ter consideration from the new Supervisors. They
will be free from the blandishments of the Assessor
elect, and with Mayor Phelan's assistance may legis
late intelligently. The public has some rights which
the fence advertisers should be compelled to respect,
and one of them is a proper regard for its personal
safety.
VOLUNTEERS TO BE RELIEVED.
REPORTS from Washington arc to the effect
that the War Department has begun in earnest
the tatk of dispatching regular troops to Manila
to relieve the volunteers now serving there. Six regi
. roents are to be sent as speedily as possible, and it is
believed they will get away by January i. The volun
teers will be relieved in the order in which they were
aligned to duty, and as a consequence the First Cali
fornia will be the first to be relieved. It is added
there is a fair prospect the Californians will be home
within three months.
This gratifying news will add to the joy of the holi
days in many a home. So long as war continued
and the flag had need of defenders on the battle-field
Californians were eager to serve wherever duty called
them. With the restoration of peace, however, there
came a natural desire to return to their homes and
their usual vocations. Most of the volunteers arc
young men who can ill afford to leave their business,
and a considerable number have families dependent
npon them. Such men could not be expected to will
ingly undertake earriÂ«^- Â£Â£- me o f peace, and
the Gcrâ mment has acted rightly in arranging to re
lieve them without further delay.
It goes without saying that when the boys come
home they will receive as grand a welcome as Califor
nia ever gave to the most distinguished guest that has
visited her shores, and in the welcome there will be a
feeling of love and pride that the coming of no guest
could excite. Our boys were the first to respond to
the call of the nation. They nobly upheld the glory
of the State as well as the cause of the republic. They
descive every honor that can be shown them, and
'â vill receive honors in an abundant measure.
Three months will soon pass away. With the com
ing of spring the heroes will come, and then San
Francisco will have one of the most jubilant days in
her history.
One of the queer features of the Nautilus, published
in Portland, is that it is published anywhere.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1898.
THE SENATORSHIP.
IT would be a pitiful, if not cdntemptible, outcome
of a great battle gallantly won if the Republican
party of California should fail to honor itself and
the State by securing the election of a Senator who i*
up to the level of our genius and reputation in the
Union.
In his address as Lord Rector of Edinburgh Uni
versity. Gladstone, in search of a figure that should
stand for the best accomplishments of man and a
metaphor of his concentrated genius, chose Califor
nia, and presented this commonwealth with a bril
liant figure, that should be carved on the lintels of
our libraries and institutions of learning.
Standing in the two hemispheres and the New
World and Old in this dignified attitude, is it possible
that the party representing a majority of our people
is limited in its choice for Senator to Grant and
Burns!
In the case of Mr. Grant, it is admitted in his pub
lished interviews and the statements of his "push"
that his candidacy originated in Eastern influences,
which have no sympathy with our people, and, in
deed, represent interests which directly antagonize
our progress and prosperity. It is also in like man
ner admitted that his candidacy is not based upon
identification with California, nor personal merit, nor
party service, nor duty well done for our people in
any emergency, but upon money properly placed
where it would do the most good to individuals before
the election, regularly receipted for, and the receipts
held as a first lien upon the votes of members of the
Legislature.
Let it not be forgotten that a Republican Senator
must succeed Senator White, who sought the place
saying that he proposed to make it possible for a poor
man to aspire to that office and win it on his merits,
and not on his money. Do we expect any more Re
publican victories here if we make it plain that the
party proposes to prevent any aspiration to the Sen
atorship that is not accompanied by a certified check,
like a bid for supplying pork to the penitentiary?
Mr. Grant's candidacy consists of a name and a
check, incumbered by an uninteresting personality,
unacquaintance with the State and incapacity for the
office he seeks.
It has been said that the first-class Senatorial ma
terial in the party has not come to the front, has not
offered itself. If this be true, is it not because unfit
ness and un worth aspiring to the office claim to have
recorded a mortgage on votes in every county that has
a Republican representation in the Legislature, which
is to be foreclosed unless some one else offers to pur
chase it as a negotiable instrument? The members of
the coming Legislature should resent the representa
tion by Mr. Grant or his agents that they are held
like wheat or prunes under a crop mortgage, given to
pay the expense of planting and harvesting them as
legislators. The broadcasting of this claim of owner
ship is being used to influence men who cannot be
mortgaged, but who very naturally wish to go with
the winner.
Mr. Grant is new to California, and newer still to
California politics. He has never been known as a
sound adviser in party councils, as a faithful worker
for party principles, as having a knowledge of the
State's needs and aspiration. To elect him is to re
duce California to company with the rotten borough
States, which are used as a convenience by distant,
rival nnd outside interests, without regard to the pride
and self-respect and self-interest of our own people.
c VANISHED ILLUSION.
COLOXEL BRYAN has sent in his resignation
to the War Department, and it has been ac
cepted. He lays aside ihc sword, the shoulder
straps and the red sash. His dream of military glory,
his hope of a war record that would brighten the tar
nished silver of his past, have gone. There re
mains to him, of all his aspirations and all his per
spirations under the Floridian sun, nothing but the
empty title of an ex-colonel.
The colonel's career as a soldier has been an epi
sode farcical from first to last, and yet there is some
thing of pathos in it. The vanishing of an illusion
always leave a sense of disappointment, even in the
minds of those who knew from the first.it was an il
lusion and could not last. We shall miss the colonel,
not from the fields of war, for he was never there, but
from the stump, where he has been appearing so pic
turesquely for the last four months, laying his hand
upon his uniformed bosom and vowing he could not
talk to his countrymen because military discipline re
strained his tongue.
The prospects are that as a national figure we arc
going to lose Bryan altogether. His coming was
noisy with the beating of bands and the shouting of
throngs; his going will be quiet as that of the
Arabs who fold up their tents and silently steal away.
This is a world of vanishing illusions. The rain
bow fades from the sky, the aurora borealis dies from
out the northern night, the rose withers in the gardens
of the south, and even a circus does not long remain
to gladden any particular town. Humanity is so used
to these things that it will not mourn over the pass
ing of Colonel Bryan. He came with aggressiveness,
and he has went with resignation. His followers of
the siher camp will soon be themselves resigned.
The dewdrop sinks into the shining sea, and Colonel
Bryan is lost in the multitude of the colonels who
have been.
By the death of Garcia the Examiner lost a valued
member of its staff. This was probably the hardest
blow it had received since its Bismarck was called so
close to the calling of its Gladstone. Happily, the
Pope still lives, the Queen Regent is well, and Mrs.
McKinley will doubtless continue to be as cheerful a
contributor as ever.
That some of the essential witnesses in the investi
gation of the T. C. Walker refuse to permit them
selves to be found does- not speak well for the condi
tion of the T. C. Walker at the time it had the misad
venture of being blown up.
In the French Chamber Monday one Deputy
shouted to another, "Come off the tribune." A
translation less marked by the veneer of politeness
'would doubtless have made this "Come off the
perch." '
Doubtless Dewey has a dread of coming hoirx*.
There can be too much of a good thing, and even the
prospect of being lionized to death can hardly be
alluring.
Perhaps the gentlemen who tried to stop the Bot
kin trial have achieved all the success they antici
pated. Their names have appeared in print several
times.
By the enthusiasm with which American troops are
greeted in Cuba, it may fairly be judged that the bit

Spain does not seem to appreciate the beauties of

evidences of being happy.
ANTI-IMPERIALIST GRANGERS.
AT the meeting of the National Grange, in Con
cord, N. H., last month, Mr. Myrick, editor of
â¢the Orange Judd Company's publications, de
livered an address on the proposed imperial policy of
the United States. He said that we entered upon a
j war solely to set Cuba free, and are emerging from it
with Porto Rico and the Philippines in our hands, and
with vexatious problems in Cuba, due to arrant mis-
representations of the situation in that island, made
prior to our taking up arms. Out of this condition
comes the demand for interstate free trade with these
islands, made by wealthy Spaniards with great inter
ests there, and powerful combinations in this coun
try which lust for the profits of tropical production by
cheap labor. After discussing the effect of this policy
upon agricultural interests at home, Mr. Myrick
uttered these significant words: "Shall our greatest
industry be sacrificed to a few manufacturing special
ties? Shall we rob the farmer of $200,000,000 a year?
Not if he knows "it. If Congress overthrew the
farmers' protection by admitting free sugar, tobacco,
fruits, vegetables, rice, etc., besides adding to his di
rect taxes, and at the same time continue protection
to the manufacturer, let no one be surprised if the
farmers and working people vote in 1900 to pitch the
custom-houses into the sea."
These are words of truth and soberness, and were
applauded and unanimously indorsed by the represen
tatives of ten millions of American farmers.
Since they were uttered the National Convention of
the Federated Trades has spoken to the same purpose,
so that it must be evident to the politicians who have
been sprinkling the path of glory and taking a clair
voyant view of manifest destiny, that their jocund
salute of problems abroad will cause far worse prob
lems at home. It required a course of education, ex
tending from the date of Clay's compromise tariff of
1832 to the Dingley bill of 1897, to make the farmer
of this country comprehend his interest in protection
and convince him that he shares its profits. The la
borer's mind on the same points has never been clear,
and the extension of the Australian ballot has left him
free to vote his doubts. With a normal demand for an
annual addition of fresh hands in all departments of
labor, skilled and unskilled, which calls for half a mil
lion new workers every year, and every immigrant
port open to their importation from the overcrowded
Old World at a steerage rate of about ten dollars per
head, American labor has remained skeptical on pro
tection. It has seen the natural vacancies in its ranks
filled from abroad, and its own children, born in this
country, crowded out by aliens, until it stands ready
to join the farmer in a crusade against a system from
the benefits of both classes will consider them
selves excluded.
If the politicians think the interests of the country
can stand another tariff agitation, and such an agita
tion as will go far beyond any that has preceded it,
let them persist in an imperial policy.
Already the measured march of a great standing army
jars the ground, and armed fleets whiten the waters of
the near future; while our present annual pension list
absorbs all but one million dollars of our total customs
receipts, and our brief Spanish war will furnish ap
plicants to take up that small balance. For the last
fiscal year our national revenue per capita of popula
tion was $4 56, our net expenses $5 96.
The tax paid per head by our people to the Federal
Government, by articles, from 1878 to 1897, both years
inclusive, was: On liquors and tobacco, average per
annum, $2,476 (two dollars forty-seven cents and six
mills); on sugar and molasses .606; miscellaneous,
â¢457; other internal taxes, .116; general tariff, besides
liquors and tobacco, $2,160. or a total average annual
taxation of $5,815 (five dollars eighty-one cents and
five mills).
The total sum realized from this taxation for the
whole period was $6,936,2 iS, 134 97. Of this $1,004.
713-389 was paid on the national debt, and current
expenses absorbed the balance. It is doubtful whether,
at the end of two decades of such taxation, our peo
ple will bear patiently the prospect of its increase dur
ing the next twenty years for the purposes of barren
conquest, the pursuit of glory or a Quixotic sentiment
of manifest destiny.
Large as this burden of taxation seems, it is less than
halt the per capita taxation of England and the mili
tary nations of Europe. Yet we are, in a politicians'
craze, to imitate, them and double our taxes, to be
spent in the pomp and circumstance of imperialism.
If this policy implied a corresponding increase in
our resources and capacity to pay taxes, it would be
contemplated with greater patience. But as it will in
evitably work to a decrease of that capacity, the revolt
of the farmer and laborer is its most certain result.
SMOTHERED BY SMOKE.
TO live in Buttc. Mont., under conditions im
posed by the smelters one needs lungs of leather
and a throat of brass. The noxious fumes thrown
off from the great chimneys, belching night and day
the deadly taint of arsenic and bearing it to every
quarter, is slaughtering the citizens. In smothered
tones, the survivors are crying for relief, and they are
told that the managers of the fatal output want time
to think about it. There are prospects that some of
them may have eternity to devote to reflection on the
subject, as they themselves have breathed the con
tagion turned loose by their own greed.
There is no reason why Butte smelters should be
allowed to indulge in chronic murder. There are ways
known to science by which the smoke may be robbed
of its power to harm. Situated in Omaha and Den
ver are the works of the Omaha and Grant Company,
the largest smelters in the world, yet the residents of
neither of these cities have suffered, nor has the vege
tation, no blade nor leaf of which can grow in Butte,
been in any degree damaged. At Denver are also the
Argo works of ex-Senator Hill, devoted to the treat
ment of refractory ores, and necessarily releasing
more arsenic than is the case with the simple leads
and coppers of Montana. All around the Argo works
are clustered the pleasant homes of workmen, and the
children playing in the streets are pictures of happi
ness and health.
These simple facts are cited to show that the Butte
smelters can stop killing people if they care to take
the trouble and go to the expense. Moreover, as they
are all multi-millionaires, and getting more so, there
is no better excuse for them than cold-blooded self
ishness. It is strange if there is no law to govern
them, or, in the known absence of such a statute, that
one should not have been long ago prescribed.
Banker Marsh, the Philadelphia wrecker who was a

of it by this time.

DAN BURNS FOR SENATOR?*
- â  ;â  ~ â , _ . . i*
Ever since W. F. Herrin unlimbered the Samson's weapon which
he carries in his head and declared himself in favor of Dan Burns for
Senator he has been hearing from the people. From one end of the
State to the other he and his scheme have been denounced by men of
every shade of political belief, and with a fewâ a contemptible few
exceptions the. newspapers of the State have emptied the vials of their
wrath upon his head. Here are a few pungent expressions of opinion
on the subject from recent exchanges:
A CAUSE FOR BITTERNESS.
The United States Senator fight is engaging the attention of all the news
papers In tho State. There is much bitterness shown toward the candidacy
of Dan Burns, and not without cause. It will be an impossibility, by any
means, to foist such a man into such an important office.â Contra Costa
Gazette.
WILL FORFEIT ESTEEM.
The Californlan, whatever his station In public or private life, who shall
make an effort toward the election of the racing sharp and delinquent ex
aecretary of State, Dan Burns, will forever forfeit the esteem, confidence and
respect of his fellow citizens.-Los Angeles Times
HERRIN'S OVERDONE SMILE.
The railroad seems to be strictly In politics. The intervention of Mr. Her
rin n the Senatorial struggle and the subsequent discovery that he was re
ceiving all comers with the same old smile indicates that he is doing many
Kinds ol politics, devious and otherwise.â Eureka Journal.
SMALL SARDINE HERRI N.
Herrin, the pitiful little corporation attorney, is in very mean business
when he drags through the political mire the name of as good a woman as
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford. The woman who sacrifices her own property in order
to maintain such an institution as the college at Palo Alto is beyond the
reach of such contemptible detractors. Ichthyotomlsts who examine that Her
rin will be apt to pronounce him the smallest sardine in the box.â Los Angeles
Times.
"WHY ESTEE WAS DEFEATED.
l, VV 1 * Marin Journal joins the leading papers of tho State in sitting down
hard on Mr. Herrln's nominee for Senator. It says: "We can conceive of
no possible contingency that would justify the Legislature In seriously con
sidering the name of Dan M. Burns for United States Senator." And it re
tl f r f \L a trUth often s PÂ° ken *Â»' indignant Republicans when it further says
mat that very worthy statesman and veteran Republican, M. M. Estee
was sacrificed in 1894. simply because It became known that Burns pulled
the wires that gave him the nomination for Governor."-Napa Register
A COOKED HERRIN.
rÂ« J }J S * **Â£ c Wa * Gr that W * F - Herrln will lose his position as chief counsel
for the Southern Pacific Railway Company before twelve months have gone.
He has made the worst diplomatic mistake possible. Before he played his
famous Senatorial gold-brk-k game on Mr. Spreckels and Mr. de Young only
one ban Francisco paper was an avowed enemy of his company, and now he
has all three of the mornfng dailies. This hostility means the loss of many
times even Mr. Herrin's large salary, and will not be endured with equa
nimity by Mr. Huntlngton. The only happy man In the Yellow Knockery
is air. Mills, who found himself deposed when Mr. Herrin came into power
but who now is likely to be reinstated as chief of the bureau of politics and
literature. "Millsy" has been sidetracked for Herrin and even made to do
the latter's bidding In his editorial columns of the Post and Record-Union
while before the advent of the attorney he was supreme and took a hand
in making Senators and Governors himself. "Millsy" Is not much of a
fighter, but he can do a heap of waiting for the other fellow to die or make
a mistake such as Herrin did, of wiggling out of the frying-pan into the
live coals of The Call and the Chronicle's roasts.â Los Angeles Herald
MERELY A POLITICAL BOSS.
The question as to who will be the next United States Senator from Cali
fornia is agitating the minds of the different aspirants for that office, and the
time will soon arrive when the people will decide at least whom they do not
want. Boss Burns has been mentioned a? a candidate, but it does not seem
possible that there Is a member of the coming Legislature who would care to
see this State disgraced by such a representative in the upper house of Con
gress. It is not to be believed that any Republican cares to damn his party
by selecting a man for Senator who possesses no other qualifications save
those of a political bops, and this fact will probably prevent the selection of
Mr. Burns.â Madera Mercury*
MAYBE DAN HAS A CONTRACT.
The San Francisco Examiner appears to be favorable to the election of
Dan Burns to the United States Senate, which gives us another chance to
witness birds of a feather flocking together.â Los Angeles Times.
ON HERRIN'S WHITE PASSES.
Colonel Dan Burns wants to ride into the United States Senate on one of
"Herrin's white passes."â Los Angeles Express.
Our esteemed Republican contemporaries of San Francisco continue to
pour hot shot into the yellow knockery, where the lair of William F. Herrin
Js located, and incidentally they rake an occasional strip of tough old hide
from the carcass of that pestiferous boss and thimble-rigging politician Dan
Burns. An extraordinary feature of the present situation is the fact that a
number of politicians in San Francisco who were presumed to he reputable
citizens, are apparently in the Burns camp. This exhibition on their part is
as surprising as it is painful, for no man can support D. M. Burns for the high
office of United States Senator and continue to retain tho confidence and re
spect of his fellow-citizens. And as for the man in the Legislature who shall
vote for that fellow Burns at the forthcoming session of the Legislature!
Well, he might just as well decorate himself with a tag showing the price he
got for his vote, for certainly no man would be found simple and silly enough
to do such a thing unless he got paid for it.â Los Angeles Times.
IT TURNS THE STOMACH.
This "mentioning" of Dan Burns as the possible successor of Senator
White is enough to turn the stomach of a dead Republican, not to mention
the painful nausea it is now causing the respectable men who comprise 09 ncr
cent of the party. Burns is offensive enough as a delegation boss without
parading him in front of decent people as worthy of the Senatorial toeaâ r nÂ«
Angeles Western Graphic. s^ os
HIS ELECTION A DISGRACE.
Dan Burns was repudiated by the Republican party four years ago when
M. M. Estee was defeated for Governor and the balance of the ticket was
elected by large majorities.
Burns represents the corrupt boss element of politics and has a small fol
lowing in San Francisco which he absolutely controls. He is a shrewd man"
ipulator of conventions, and at the last State convention had 38 of the IGO
votes from San Francisco in his vest pocket. It would be a lasting disgrace
to California to elect Boss Burns as United States Senator.â Red Bluff Yews

For several weeks there have been

there is ample water at all times to admit

been proposed. While Goat Island has

ravor, because it is already owned by the
government, and sites on the Alariieda,
Aiarin and Contra Costa shores of the
nay nave been vigorously boomed as the
best for the new dock. Bur none of these
places will get it. The Washington cor

and Mr. Hilborn replied that the new dock
must of necessity be located^ at; Mare Isl

Congress expressly designated that place

Funeral of RÂ«v. Frank Percival
Smedley of Stanford University.
The passing of the Rev. Frank Percival
Smedley, Unitarian minister and theo
logical graduate of Stanford University,
whose funeral was held Monday morn
ing at the Mission Masonic Temple, is
fraught with pathetic interest to his many
friends. Born in Eng!and, # his early days
were spent near the village of Hawarden,
where he became a chorister In the church
attended by "William Ewart Gladstone. A
boy of many mental and physical attrac
tions, the promise of which was amply
fulfilled in later years, his strong per
sonality brought him to the notice of the
great statesman, who became his friend
and patron. Many happy days were spent
by young Smedley at Hawarden Castle,
where he grew to know Mr. Gladstone
intimately. Destined for the Church of
England, the time came when irreconcil
able doubts entered his mind, and he Lie
came a Unitarian, much atr;iinst tne
wishes of his family and friends. His
health becoming impaired, he left &ng
land four years ago for California, and
took a theological course at Stanford,
where he found a friend in Professor
Griggs. After his graduation he was or
dained a year ago last May at the con
ference in Portland. Placed in charge of
a church In Santa Maria, his health failed
and he returned to San Francisco. Ho
wont to a charge in Visalia, but was un
able to carry on the work. lie then re
solved to go" to England by a palling ves
sel, and ten .lays ago engaged his passage
on a ship at Port Costa. The captain on
seeing him recognized the sad condition
of the young clergyman's health and re
fused to take him as a passenger. In
utter despair he returned to his lodging
house on Shotwell street and resigned
himself to the inevitable, losing, a few
hours later, all consciousness-of the sights
and sounds around him, and within a
week passed away.
At the conclusion of the funeral serv
ices, at whicn the Rev. Dr. Stebbins and

750 Mission St.BURNS' CANDIDACY IS
NOW UNDER A CLOUD
Humors of the Situation as Viewed by Young
Mr. Grant of the Extreme
South.
Circumstantial Evidence to Prove That He Knifed the State
Ticket in Order to Secure the Election of
His Southern Legislative
Candidates,
A blight seems to have struck the
Senatorial boom of Colonel Dan Burns
of Mexico, and there is a very apparent
air of depression about his headquar
ters at the Palace Hotel. His hatchet
men are still pursuing the rumors that
come up from the sunny southland,
and his strikers are still chasing bash
ful legislators who hail from the in
terior, but they have lost the vim and
vigor that marked their efforts imme
diately after the untruthful Herrin let
the cat out of the bag concerning the
colonel's candidacy.
To be sure, the daily bulletins given
the expectant public by Burns' lieu
tenants are still to the effect that sixty
one votes are pledged to their chief and
that the landslide has only just begun.
It is also a fact that the colonel him
self has announced to close personal
friends that he is in the fight to stay
to the end. Added to this announce
ment is another that comes from
Schoolboy Herrin, who declares that he
â will "shove his programme through, no
matter what it costs." In spite of
these things, however, the steady driz
zle of gloom that has shut down on and
blotted out the glad smile and high
hopes of the Burns following grows
thicker as the days go by. One after
another the legislators whom Colonel
Burns and Baby Herrin have hereto
fore considered as their private chattels
have dropped into town and publicly
unced that they will not vote for
Burns. Some say they are pledged to
â  candidates, others declare their
belief that Burns' election would be a
i- athbloWi to the party, and not a few
ss that they would not dare go
b;ick to their constituents after voting
i ir the gentleman from Mexico. What
ever the excuse given, the result is the
same, and with the passing of the days
the Btock of Burns, Herrin & Hunting
tun drops lower and lower in the politi
cal market.
While depression marks the mien of
the Burns cohorts about the corridors
of the Palace the temperature con
tinues to fall in the vicinity of the yel
low building at the corner of Mont
â¢y and Market streets. Icicles
the cornices when Blunderer
Herrin and Editor Mills meet by chance
. â¢ hallways, and the messenger
boys who carry necessary correspond

truthful One to the chiefs of other de
partments in Uncle Collis' knockery,

amusing feature of Burns' down
fall is the manner in which it affects
the political hacks w 1 - are spending
the money belonging to the Eastern
friends of U. S. Grant. While the
T oung-man-with-a-name is at home
trying to memorize the names of the
tiea of the State his hired boomers
are stationed at various points
throughout the State studying up plans
for the further increase of their bank
rolls. As soon as a legislator from the
interior declares himself n-qinst Burns
and Bungler Herrin a telegram is dis
patched to Grant, couched in terms
something like this:
United States Senator U. S. Grant, San
Diego, Cal.: Easy mark out against
Burns. Think he Is ours. Two hun. will
make the thing a cinch. Don't delay.
Yours, till death. E. Z. GRAFTER.
So the game progresses. Grant now
has 201 votes out of a possible 120
pledged to himself. How can he lose?

[of two hours during the day. His
i evenings are employed in looking up
the Zante currant question, studying
the tariff needs of California and writ
ing telegrams to his Eastern friends for
j "more dough." He has progressed so
j rapidly in his lessons that he "knows

j ated in California and that it is chief
â ly noted for its tules, which are made
i into life preservers for export trade,
i and quaint reminiscences of Colonel
Burns, the latter being particularly
for campaign purposes.
To be serious, it is now evident that
: young Mr. Grant and his friends are
1 aware of the fact that the charge that
the Grant forces in San Diego County
stabbed the Republican State ticket in
the back in order to gain votes for
| their county candidates for the Legis
l lature had had some considerable
I weight with California Republicans
j generally, and more particularly with
! members of the Senate and Apse,mbly
! elect. As early as the middle of last
| October the charge was made in San
Diego County that friends of U. S.
I Grant Jr. were trading votes for Henry
i T. Gage for Governor for votes for A.
!E. Nutt for Senator and for L. R.
i Works for Assemlyman. Rumors of
I this alleged treachery to the Repub
lican State ticket on the part of Grant
and his friends reached the Southern
California headquarters full two weeks
before the State campaign closed. It
; was well verified and was to this ef
jfect: That Charles Hard: one of the
Republican leaders in San Diego
County, and .Grant's local manager,
i had made a combination with J. Har
vey McCarthy, editor of the Gallagher-
Maguire organ in San Diego, whereby
it was understood that the Gallagher-
Maguire cohorts there were to support
the Republican legislative candidates
in the interest of Grant's Senatorial
i candidacy, in consideration of which
I Hardy and his Republican friends were
to support Maguire and the Demo
cratic State ticket.
H. Z. Osborne, Frank P. Flint and W.
F. Parker, members of the executive
committee of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee, called the attention of
Grant and his friends to this allega
tion, and both Hardy and Grant de
' nied it and said returns? from San
! Diego County would bear them out in
their denial. But they evidently fig
ured wrong. Returns from San Diego
County went to show that the Grant
j legislative ticket was about 1000 votes
ahead of the Republican candidate for
Governor, and that in the city of San
Diego the greater portion of treacher
ous work had been done.
Ever since the count was completed
j in San Diego County Grant's friends
have been busy trying to disprove the
charge of having knifed the Republican
i State ticket in Grant's personal inter-
S est.
J. Harvey McCarthy, editor of the
San Diego Gallagher-Maguire organ,
and Charles Hardy, the party with
whom the combination was made, are
now en route to this city for a con
ference with Milton Green, Grant's
northern manager. The object of this
meeting is to agree upon some kind of
a story that will offset tlie absolute
proof that the McCarthy-Harvey syn
dicate was formed to knife Henry T.
Gage in order to make .a few votes for
Grant's candidates for the Senate and
Assembly in San Diego County.
FIGHT BETWEEN "FAKE"
AND OTHER MEDIUMS
IT MAY BE SOON VENTILATED IN
THE POLICE COURT.
Bishop Garrison and Mrs. Fish-Schles
inger Apply for Warrants for
an Alleged Libel Upon
Them.
The division amonp; the ranks of the
spiritualists caused by the exposures of
Bishop Garrison and others of what they
term "fake" mediums has reached an
acute stage, and may be ventilated in the
Police Court.
Yesterday Garrison, accompanied by
Mr?. Fish-Schleslnger, applied in Judge
Joachimsen's. court for a warrant for the
arrest of the members of the State
Board of Spiritualists and the editor of
the Philosophical Journal on a charge of
libel. Garrison produced a copy of the
Journal of December 8, which
a report of the last meeting of The State
board, embodying resolutions passed re
flecting upon him and Mrs. I> lsh-Schles
inger in language that was far from
compjlmentary, and blaming them for all
the disturbance that has arisen in the
ranks of the organization. The resolu
tions also provided that all indorsements
issued by the board should be revoked
and new ones Issued, so that Garrison
and Mrs. Fish-Schlesinger would be left
out in the cold.
The warrant was not issued, as it was
a question whether the proceedings of a
State board and t.ie publication of the
same could be considered llbelous. They
were told to return this morning, when
an answer would be given.
Every Sunday afternoon for weeks Gar
rison has ueen telling audiences in Scot
tish Hall about the devices of "fake" me
diums, and has brought down upon his
head the wrath of President Norton and
other members of the State board. Gar
rison has a. large following, and the fight
will in all probabilHv.be a bitter one.

THE LIEUTENANT
GOVERNOR WILL
NOT ACCEPT
Declines to Be a Bank
Commissioner.
THAT VACANT JUDGESHIP
JUDGE WALLACE'S ATTITUDE
CAUSER CRITICISM.
Ex-State Senator Per?y Henderson
Will Probably Be Appointed Chief
Wharfinger â Some Politi-
cal Gossip.
Lieutenant Governor Jeter arrived in
the city yesterday from his home in
i Santa Cruz. In the afternoon he called
; upon Governor Budd at the Palace Ho
| tel and officially notified him that he
j would be unable to accept the appoint
| ment of Bank Commissioner, which was
j tendered him by the Governor some
i days ago. The Governor expressed his
! disappointment, but he was unable to
overcome the decision of the Lieutenant
Governor, who urged the fact that his
private business affairs would not per
mit him to give his time and attention
to the duties of a public office, parti
cularly one the duties of which are so
onerous and important as that of Bank
Commissioner.
The Lieutenant Governor's declina
tion will aiso prove a disappointment
to his many friends in both political
parties to whom he has endeared him
i self during his term of office. The Gov
ernor has as yet given no intimation
of whom he intends to appoint to the
position which he had tendered to the
Lieutenant Governor. The appointee
I will, as a matter of course, be a resident
! of the northern section of the Slate, and
as there are many who are seeking the
appointment the Governor will have no
j lack of material to choose from.
Governor Budd has not yet announced
whom he will appoint to ill I the judge
ship left vacant by the death of the
late Judge Rhodes Borden. It is gen
erally conceded that the place will
i probably be given to W. P. Lawlor,
! whose services to his party during the
j last campaign were invaluable and who
I has always been identified with the best
! interests of the party in the city and
State. Much comment has been in
| dulged in among Democrats and others
I concerning the manner in which Super
i ior Judge Wallace has sought to secure
i the appointment for himself. It is as
i sertod that inasmuch as he submitted
his cause to the people at the last elec
tion and was defeated, though three
of the four Superior Judges elected
were Democrats, It is a display of bad
! taste for him now to seek to ignore the
wishes of a majority of the electors by
asking for the appointment. In this re-
J spect his action has been contrasted
> with that of Justice Van Fleet, who re
fused the appointment of Supreme
Court Commissioner after having been
j defeated for re-election as Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court. It is not
; considered probable that Wallace's
j claims will be seriously considered by
i the Governor, though the fact that he
j has solicited the appointment is creat
| ing much adverse comment.
M. H. Smith, not he of the silken
' beard, who is an apostle of the Harbor
* 'ommissioners, but a gentleman well
I known in both municipal and State pol
itics, has been prominently mentioned
for Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate.
Mr. Smith has many supporters, among
them being Secretary of State-elect
Charles F. Curry. Leslie Blackburn,
j who sought the support of the Alameda
i delegation for the position, failed to
| secure the indorsement of that body at
a recent caucus, but instead the Ala
1 meda legislators declared themselves in
favor of Lou Martin, who is well known
in Oakland politics.
It is generally understood that the
i position of Chief Wharfinger on the
j water front, which will become vacant
i January 1, will be given to ex-State
| Senator Percy Henderson. The an
; nouncement is received with general
satisfaction. Harbor Commissioner Col
non'a efforts to secure the appointment
I far his nephew, Harry Scott, have met
j with no response by the other members
of the board.
TO BETTER THE STATE.
Manufacturers Discuss Pure Foods
and Merchant Marine Service.
The directors of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association met yesterday and
discussed several matters of more than
passing Interest. The pure foods commit
tee submitted the outline of a proposed
bill creating a bureau, the officers of
which are charged with the duties of pun
ishing all violators of the pure foods laws.
It is to consist of three commissioners to
be appointed by the Governorâ one from
the northern part of the State, one from
the south and the third from San Fran
cisco. The permanent employes are to
consist of a manager, an attorney, a chief
inspector and an official chemist. The
commissioners are to serve without pay.
The proposed act calls for a yearly appro
priation of $r,0.(X)0. It calls for the inspec
tion of all foods, drinks and drugs. Also
for the prosecution of violators of the
laws relating to pure foods and to the
laws governing the branding and labeling
of goods, and provides that all pence offi
cers. District Attorneys and State and
county officials shall assist and co-operate
with the commission. It was indorsed
by the directors.
*A resolution was passed requesting the
California delegation to vote for the Sen
ate hill appropriating $3. r .0.000 to aid "an
exhibit of American made goods suitable
for exports" to be displayed next year un
der the auspices of the Philadelphia Mv-
Beum. Another matter acted upon was
favorable to sending a petition to Con
gress to enact new laws with a view of
increasing our merchant marine. This
includes the river and harbor bill now be
fore Congress.

WAR TAX CASES
SUBMITTED TO
JUDGE MORROW
Should the Express
Company Pay?
A CLEAN-CUT ISSUE MADE
LIST OF AUTHORITIES PRESENT
ED TO THE COURT.
Lawyer Squires Objects to Any Com
plication or Befogging of
the Issues In
volved.
The Wells-Fargo stamp tax cases were
tried yesterday before Judge Morrow in
the United States Circuit Court and sub
mitted. There were two suitsâ one
brought against the corporation by G. B.
Benham and the other by B. Johnson.
They were originally brought in the
Justices' Court, but on motion of "Wells,
Fargo & Co. on the gTound that the ques
tion involved was a Federal one they
were removed to the Circuit Court.
There was no jury, the facts of the case
being admitted, and the court being asked
to pass upon the law, the Issue being,
"Should the company pay the war tax
stamp on packages entrusted to It for
transportation or should the senders of
the packages pay for the stamp?"
George D. Squires appeared for the
plaintiffs and Alfred Sutro for the express
company. The points made by the attor
neys were the same as were decided by
Justice of the Peace Barry and Superior
Judge Troutt Fame weeks ago. In both
cases the plaintiff demanded $50 damages
for the refusal of Wells. Fargo & Co. to
take packages of merchandise unless the
purchaser paid for the war tax stamp.
The express company contended that the
law does not require the corporation to
pay for the stamp.
Judge Morrow said that he would give
a decision in the case before the next
term of the Circuit Court of Appeals,
which opens on the first Monday in Feb
ruary, so that cither party could have an
opportunity of an early hearing in that
j tribunal should nn appeal be hud.
After the matter had been submitted to
i the court Mr. Sutro said that Attorney
! General Fitzgerald had brought suit for a
1 writ of mandate in a similar matter and
I that it would be transferred to the Fed
! oral courts at the January term. He sug
! gested that Judge Morrow should con
sider the present cases and the Attorney
General's suit at the same time.
Mr. Squirts expressed the opinion that
I such would not be a wise or a safe mode
<of procedure. The suit of the Attorney
General being for a writ of mandate,
there might be some jurlsdictional facts
involved which would bring In an issue
! foreign to the one just submitted to the
court.
I Judge Morrow asked Mr. Sutro whether
he was not aware that the United States
Circuit Court issues mandates only on be
half of its own processes. The court was
I Inclined to the opinion that the suit of the
Attorney General would involve a Juris
1 dictional question.
Mr. Squires said that the issues in the
' two cases just submitted were fair and
; square and clean rut. What his clients
: wanted to know was what was meant by
I the war revenue act. Did it mean that
1 the private citizen should pay the war tax
', on packages sent by express or that the
express companies should pay it? The
j case of the Attorney General would cloud
I the issue and bring in a matter not at all
! pertinent. _
The authorities quoted by Mr. Squires
In his argument were the following:
' Judge Tuley of the Circuit Court, the
: Michigan Circuit Court, the Michigan Su
i perior Court, Judge Troutt of San Fran
cisco, Justice of the Peace Barry, the At
! torney General of the United States, the
! Assistant Attorney General of the United
1 States and Internal Revenue Commission
i er Scott. All these have decidede that the
1 express companies must pay the tax.

TOO ANXIOUS
TO BUILD UP
A SOCIETY
Queer Procedure of
Rev. Henderson.
HE SEIZED TWO CHILDREN
WANTED THEM FOX OAKLAND
HOME FINDING SOCIETY.
Sacramento People Will Contest
His Bight to the Posses
sion of tne Little
Ones.
The officers of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children are
much incensed over the action of Rev.
J. E. Henderson of Oakland, who, it is
alleged, took two abandoned children
from Sacramento and placed them in
a home in Oakland without warrant or
order of court.
It has been learned that Henderson
is superintendent of a society in Oak
land known as the Home Finding So
ciety of Oakland, which is now under
going the process of incorporation.
Miss Mary Brandau, assistant superin
tendent of that society, is now in Sac
ramento. She found that the two chil
dren in question had been brought from
Nevada by their mother and abandoned
in Sacramento, and at once sent for
Henderson and turned the children over
to him, although she acknowledges he
had no legal authority whatever to
take them. Rabbi A. Simon, secretary
of the Sacramento society, heard of the
matter and at once entered a protest.
He began inquiring about Henderson,
and was informed that the reverend
gentleman had been expelled from a
ministerial society and is at the present
time under a cloud.
An Interview with J. W. Daniels, as
sistant superintendent of the local
Home Finding Society, brings out some
interesting statements regarding Hen
derson's career. It is as follows:
"Rev. J. E. Henderson was once a
parson at Angels Camp, and the Meth
odist minister who succeeded him there
says that his proper place is in the
State prison.
"He is jealous of the Children's Home
Finding Society of California, and by
way of discrediting it spread reports
that the society sells children. Desir
ing to entrap me he wrote a letter from
Tehama under the name of H. W. Bar
tram, saying that he wanted a child.
In a second he asked how much he
would have to pay for a healthy child,
and in a third he offered $100. I have
copies of the letters to prove all my
statements."
The Sacramento societies will prob
ably make an effort to regain control
of the children taken by Henderson,
but they are at a loss to understand
why he should carry them away when
he must have known he had no legal
right to do so.
CONTRACTS LET.
The Valley Railway Awards Two
Large Grading Contracts.
The directors of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valiey Railway held their

transacting the usual routine business the
directors let two ir^-rtant contracts for

piece of grading beginning at Point Rich
mond and extending 3000 feet east. This
contract was let to Foley Brothers and
Mulr of Minnesota, which is the same
firm that did the work on the long tun
nel at Martinez. The second was for a
piece of grading beginning where the first
contract ended and running nine miles to
Pinole. This was let to Grant Brothers of
this city.
Third Vice-President J. C. Stubbs of the
Southern Pacific, who has been in the
East ever since November 17. returned

Mr. Stubbs declares that his visit to New
York has no special significance. He
merely went on for a general consultation
with his people. On the way back he stop
ped off at St. Louis to attend a meeting
of the Southwestern Freight Bureau. Mr.
Stubbs says that the meeting developed
nothing startling beyond a general dis
cussion of the subjects of freight rates.
Mr. Stubbs is much improved by his trip
and declares that he is in better health

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW FORK BTOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Dec. 13.â The stock market was
irrcsular to-day during the process of digesting
larpe realizing sales .ring the current move
ment, prominent railways closing at about the
lowest. The market encountered efforts on the
part of sold-out bulls to depress values and
was largely affected by the demoralization In
ported and gained a point subsequently de
cltned five points en reported demoralization
in the sugar trade. In the early dealings the
moderate fractional advice here followed th?
improvement in London, where the public were
buyers of Americans. Subsequently stocks be
came quite reactive, but sales, particularly in
the standard stocks, were well taken on ;%ctual
Investment and semi-Investment purchases and
covering of short contracts.
Rallies ensued, particularly among the earlier
sufferers, and around delivery hour gains were
considerable. The Atchison issues recently
brought to the front by prominent interests
were a sustaining factor. The vulnerability of
Sugar was largely responsible for the extreme
irregularity of the market. The traders ham
mered this specialty Industriously and uncov
ered round amounts of stop-loss orders. Con
siderable support was extended to the general
market throughout and pool buying was in
strumental in lifting into prominence some of
the low priced stocks which had not as yet
moved in proportion to the rest of the list.
Missouri Pacific was the only laggard in this
category of shares, profit taking conspiring to
keep the price well below yesterday's level.
The Federal Steel stocks, which had been
left somewhat neglected, were taken in hand
late In the day and advanced materially.
Speculation finally betrayed a very good under
tone, considering the heavy blocks of realizing
orders which came out after every rally. Later
operations were quite extensive, arbitrage deal
ings being for both accounts, but heavily In
favor of the bulls. Omaha took the initiative In
the final rise in prices and gained three points.
Northwest moved up sympathetically, but the
advance in the other grangers was not signifi
cant. Speculation left off heavy in tone with
net changes anally either way.
The bond market gave a better illustration of
Ftrcntrth than the stock list, although realizing
orders were In force In the speculative is
sues, final prices recording substantial gains
In many rase?. Total sales, $$,710,000.
United States 3s, the old 4s coupon and the 2s
registered advanced % in the bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 910.400

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 13.â Opening prices in wheat
were practically unchanged from "esterday.
Northwest receipts were comparatively small,
but this was offset by a decline of %d in fu
tures and Id for spot at Liverpool. For a few
minutes prices were at a standstill with very
narrow trading. Shorts were good buyers
and many longs, acting on the belief that prices
were in for a good advance. Increased their
holdings. Apparently the rapid decline in
farmers' deliveries in the Northwest overshad
owed everything else in its Influence on trad
ers. Argentine news was favorable, and early
reports from the seaboard did not indicate very
bright prospects for a continued good foreign
demand for American wheat, one cable from
Germany refusing offerings ÂÂ» the ground that
Russia was offering- wheat under American
parity. Nevertheless the local sentiment was
bullish, and even at the good advance wheat
did not come out in very great quantities.
Near the end of the session reports of heavy
shipping orders here for St. Louis and the
seaboard proved an additional stimulus to buy-
Ing, and May, which up to that time had. been
steady, closed firm, at an advance of about
%c
Corn was active and higher. Local bull
traders bought aggressively. The wheat
strength had considerable influence. May
closed %c higher.
Oats, though rather dull, were firm Offer
ings were not large. May closed %<f?'%c higher
Provisions were rather wobbly. The demand
was very good, but hog receipts were heavy,
and packers offered freely of all products
Liquidation became lighter late In the day
and the market firmed up somewhat. May
pork closed 5c lower and lard and ribs 2%c
lower.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

DRIED FRUIT IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, Dec. 13.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The situation In dried fruits is
rather unusual for this time of the year. In
pplte of reported small stocks, based on the
fhort crops of the past season, prices in many
lines are barely steady and buyers seem to be
indifferent as to the future. The latter are
miking no purchases for future delivery and
are buying spot goods only In accordance witn
ac tual needs of the present. In many of the
leading lines this apathy of buyers is having a
depressing effect and whereas at this season
the market is usually strong If not tending up
ward the feeling generally appears to be easy.
The purchase by interior buyers of a consider
able quantity of peaches, apricots and prunes,
chiefly the first named, has relieved this mar
ket of a weight that has been depressing it
for some time past, but hag. not as yet re
sulted in any reaction, which might be ex
pected to follow the lifting of such a load.
There Is, however, much more confidence felt
In the future of apricots and peaches and less
disposition is shown to sell. As to prunes the
scarcity of larger sizes restricts business, as
the demand is chiefly for this kind, but there
Is no Improvement in prices to be Doted. In
California raisins the situation is styi uncer
tain, though the statement of the president of
the California Raisin Growers' Association is
calculated to have a reassuring effect upon
those who have believed that the organization
C 4 ntemplated making a revolution in the busi
ness. The larger handlers In the East, how
ever, express great dissatisfaction with the
proposed cut in the commission of 2Â£ per cent,
and some of them say the growers will make
more enemies than friends if they put that plan
Into cperation next year. Most of the dis
tributors at this end, on the other hand, ex
t.nss an indifference as to what the growers
may do, the inference being that supply and
demand will regulate the market in the future
as in the p;ist.
LONDON WOOL SALES.
LONDON. Dp<\ 13.â The atltcion !>ales of woo!
for the year closed to-day. The closing tone
was firm and the prices realized to-day were
practically the best of the series. The num
ber of bales carried over was 21.000: 57,000 wer*
sold to home buyers and 80,000 to the Continent.
At the opening of the sales competition was
active and merinos firm. Fine crossbreds were
well maintained, while low coarse Btock ruled
Irregular at a fall of 5 per cent under the
October figures. The demnnd ror merinos in
creased, the Continent being especially eager
buyer?. After the first sale of the week me
dium scoured and greasies and scoured locks
and pieces advanced 5 per cent and finer (Trader
of wool wore better supported. Yorkshire
wools sold at full value and at an unapproach
able advance over the prices obtained at the
October s:ales. Crofsbreds were wen sought
for slr.ee the opening, and especially medium
and coarse. Heavy Continental stocks were
low, owing to the Buenos Ayres gold premium
being against them and the fact that French
1 uv. rs ha.i turned their attention here at the
same time. Yorkshire wools increased In de
mand. Riverina new clip wools turned out

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS AND RAISINS.
The New York Commercial says of that mar
ket: "The prune situation is unchanged.
Large sizes are wanted, and wanted badly, but
are practically unobtainable, excepting in.
small quantities. Spot supplies are limited,
and there are few In first hands on the coast.
The bulk of large sizes have been taken in
Washington and Oregon, very few being left
in first hands in either State. All stocks are
firmly held and prices are likely to advance as
they move into consumption.
"The raisin outlook shows no particular
change. Holders have few loose Muscatels in
Ftock, but consuming demand is net large, and
prices remain only steady. Foreign stocks are
quiet, though there has been considerable In
quiry regarding supplies to be obtained, pro
vided they were wanted. There is almost no
call for Malagas, nor has there been through
the season.
"Peaches continue firm. Offerings are small,
but demand is smaller. high prices serving to
restrict trade. Exporters show some interest
but purchases are small, because present quo
tations prevent profitable pales. HoldeVs are
firm in their views, preferring to wait before
conceding anything to buyers, even to secure
business. _â¢ â¢*.>
"Apricots remain steady at high range. High
quotations do not call out additional supplies,
and the inference Is that there are few more
to come forward, even under thÂ« most favor
able price conditions. There is -no export de
mand worth mentioning-, and spot dealing is
restricted by price conditions."
The local market continues dull and de
pressed and Prunes are especially so.

A local circular says of Wool: "There has
, been some local trade the past week, but It
l is not of a large magnitude and chiefly em
â¢ braces the better types of Northern Humboldt
) and Mendocino spring and fall stock, as well
as some short good foothill wool. This trade
I has been confined to two buyers, one of whom
; has filled up, while the other is yet in the
â¢ market for considerable wool If he can agree
, as to value. The present weather, which is
â  reported to be Intensely cold in the East and
I Northwest, will have a tendency to make more
active trade in wool, and all dealers are hope
1 ful that after January 1 the clothing trade
, will be so brisk as to justify them in placing
larger orders for heavyweight goods than has
, been the rule for the past two winters."

BUDD ALLUDES TO THE FERRY
THANKING THE BURGOMEIST
ERS OF ANTWERP.
"The State University Shall Not Pay
for Any State Legislation," Says
Regent James J3L
Budd.
Governor Budd. as presiding officer of
the University Regents' meeting, placed
his official foot down yesterday on paying
fees for legislation in the Interest of that
Institution. This expression did not come
from a motion along that lino nor from
an attempt of some vandal lobbyist to
break into thÂ« university's now somewhat
empty strong-box, ijut from a lonely
thought struggling up to light through
the convolutions of the gubernatorial
thinker.
"I don't see why one department of the
State should buy anything from another,
or in other terms, why the University of
California should pay a cent for legisla
tion from the Legislature of California.
Hereafter bills in the interest of the great
State school must go to the Capitol un
accompanied by a fee."
Regent Chester Kowell, who is a Sen
ator-elect from Fresno, does not see what
part in the culture of the football giants
of Berkeley a mammoth Gallapagos turtle
1b bound to play. The question came up
on the motion to pay $100 for a number
of natural historical subjects from those
South Pacific islands, among which speci
mens, was the big amphibia. Whether
Senator Rowell had harkened to Regent
Ilallidle's plaints of rainless hard times
and a depleted university fund, or wheth
er he thought that the student could get
moro instruction in reptilia on sea-turtle-
Boup days during a restaurant dinner for
two-bits with other gastronimic studies
on the side, he did not mention, he vot
ed a lone "no," 'and the university will
have Gallapagos turtle on its mental bill
of-fare.
On the matter of raising the salary of
Superintendent of Buildings McKillican
from $50 to $100 per month during the
j r. ipress of repairs now under way, the
board voted in the affirmative. Mr. Halli
dle objected on economical grounds, but
Governor Budd stated that he understood
McKillican was a careful and an able
man and from the building troubles con
nected with the new ferry structure on
the water front he thought a good care
ful, able superintendent was worthy of
his hire.
The favorable recommendation of the \
committee on the purchase of the prop
erty at the corner of First and Market \
streets, now occupied by the Fulton Iron j
Company and others for $210,000, was re- !
ceived. It was shown to be a good in- {
vestment of university money and the
purchase was ordered.
In the consideration of the Horticul
tural College communication relative to
plant and animal parasites and the meas
that should be taken In the prom
â¢c. Ptiu Budd said the State had been
handicapped from taking the proper ac
: y tlie absence of all bearing on the
matter.
Mr. Dcnieke asked if the State did not
have a veterinary surgeon, and Regent
Ji>hn Budd wanted, to know if ho was
alive.
"1 think fo," answered the Governor,
"I signt-d a $160 warrant for him the
other d;ty."
It was moved that an instructor and ln
vfstitrator should be sent among the
dairies and cattle ranches and search for
cattle diseases, also instruct stock rais
era how to prevent and cure such epi
demic among their herds.
Regents WaJlace, Foote, Denicke, Phelps
and Rodgers were appointed a committee
in the matter of a statue to James Lick
in Golden Gate Park. The unveiling of
the proposed statute and other ceremonies
of the occasion are to take plac# Septem
ber 9, 1900, the fiftieth anniversary of tha
admission of California to the Union.
The Regents officially thanked the
Buxgomeistera of Antwerp for the crm-
Fideratlon and courtesy shown Mrs.
Thebe R. Hearst and the Jury of Inter
national Competition for the Phebe
Hearst architectural plan for the univer-
sity.
In the matter of finding a successor to
President Kellogg, who pome time ago
tendered his resignation, a committee con-
Flsting of the Governor, Mrs. Hearst, Hal
lldle. Rodgers, President Kellogg and
BpeaJier of Assembly was appointed to
name the new head of the University of
California.
Coroner's Powers Limited.
The powers of a Coroner to impose pun
ishment for contempt have been more im
aginary than real, according to a decision
of the Supreme Court yesterday. The case
in which this decision was made was that
of Dr. Charles G. Kuhlman against the
Superior Court, or more particularly
against Judge Dalngerfield. The position
is taken that the Coroner has no right to
find a witness guilty of contempt. The
proper course is to have a witness who
refuses to answer taken before the Su
perior Court, where the matter of con
tempt shall be judicially heard. It is then
duly In th~e power of that court to dispose?
of the witness and the alleged contempt.
In the case In question the judgment of
contempt was passed by the Coroner and
the Superior Court imposed the penalty
without, trying the cause.
POSTUM CEREAL.
COFFEE CAUSED IT.
A Simple Way to Locate tho Cause
of Disease.
I was troubled for years with my
Btognach, and took all sorts of remedies,
without being able to get well. I did
not know all this time what was the
cause of the trouble, but since I quit
drinking coffee I found out that was
the enemy that cost me so many days
and nights of suffering.
Within an hour after breakfast where
I would drink a cup of coffee I would
Fpit up the meal, and if I drank coffee
for supper I would go to bed and my
nerves twitched and jerked so badly
that I was afraid to lie down.
Sometimes my stomach would flutter
terribly.
I was afraid I would have paralysis,
and I firmly believe I would if I had
kept on using coffee.
I believe so much coffee drinking is
the whole cause of so many dying with
paralysis and heart trouble.
All I can say is all this nervousness
and stomach trouble has left me since
I have been using Postum Food Coffee
according to directions on the package
aod I know of quite a number that
have been helped by Postum.
If people would use Postum Cereal
Pood Coffee they would save hundreds
of dollars in doctors' bills, and chil-
dren would be stronger and brighter if
their parents would use it Instead of
coffee. Of course it has to be made
ri^ht, but that is easy. Just let it boil
fifteen or twenty minutes after it real-
ly starts to boiling, and you have a
splendid drink. Mrs. Annie Van Bus-
kirk, 2632 Santa. Fe avenue, Ft. Madi-

A POOR START CAUSED IT
MISS ROWENA ONCE MORE DE
FEATS MARY BLACK.

Flying Colors â Daisy F a Handy
Winner â Four Favorites
Were First.
There are no "cinches" In horse racing
any longer. Mamie O, the black mare
owned by bookmaker Caesar Young, a
starter in the last race at Ingleside yes
terday, came as near being one as is pos
sible. The distance was one mile, and
the smartest people on the track accepted
the 5 to 2 laid about her with a smile.
When Mr. Caldwell released the barrier
she was facing the reverse way of the
track. Jones, who had the mount, took
after the field, and, gradually creeping to
the front, was beaten out but a neck at
the wire by Libertine, a 5 to 1 chance.
â With an even break she could not have
lost, but so goes the game.
This was not the only ragged start Mr.
Caldwell made. Still the weather was
very raw and cold and on this point alone
can the veteran flag wielder's wretched
work be excused. Many fractious horses
are sent to the post these days, and a re
call flag, if used with discretion, would
prevent many a bonfire in which gold and
currency furnish the fuel.
The card Itself was a big improvement
over the one furnished on the opening
i day, and with more protection furnished
: them at the post speculators would have
invested much more heavily. Four favor
i ites again succeeded in winning purses.
Miss Rowena regained her tarnished
laurels in the five-furlong scramble, in
which she hooked up with Mary Black.
It was even money and take your pick,
and the local celebrity led the Eastern
! mare all the way, covering the distance in
I 1:00 flat, now the track record. Mary
j Black had Johnny Reiff on her back, and
'â â  the diminutive race rider was about as
I much of a success as a Chinese cook
would be making a parachute jump.
The opening live-furlong number for
maiden two-year-olds was prolific of
many warm things. Ballista, the Montana
bred colt, carrying the colors of Billy
Randall, made all the running and won
hands down. He opened in the betting at
;>, to 1, and closed at 2. Judge Wofford
finished three lengths ahead of Fermo for
the place. A poor start ruined the
chances of the others.
A big plunge was made on Pat Mor
rtesey to win the mile selling run, at post
time G to 5 being the best obtainable.
Frank McMahon'a gelding raced along
out in front with Imperious, and the clip
they set killed them both off. At the
end McNickels brought Daisy F up and
won at leisure in 1:41 Vi. Morrissey was
downed four lengths for the place by Im
perious.
Joe Ullman. now racing in the colors of
Duke & Wishard, made his inltiau ap
pearance this meeting in the five and one
half furlong spin, third on the card. He
went to the post a 7 to 10 choice, and after
parting company with Ferrier passed the
judÃcti first eased up. Ferrier waa hard
ridden to get tho place from Kamsin.
Ed Purser's gelding Buckwa was the
popular selection for the mile selling run
that followed. The bay horse was backed
to 7 to 10 favoritism, and led the rank
outsider Our Climate out by a couple of
lengths in I:4lft. Paul Grlges sulked both

"W. H. Cheppu, one of the oldest book

After the Buckwa raco the judges cau
tioned Bullman about being too anxious
to take inside nosltion.
The occupants of a Mission street elec
tric line car had a very unpleasant expe
rience shortly before 2 o'clock yesterday
afternoon. It was loaded with racegoers,
and at the point where the car crosses the
Southern Pacific Railroad track, west of
the Branch County Jail, the motive power
gave out. Not many rods away the last
race train came thundering along, and a
wild scramble was made by the street
car passengers to escape death. Fortu
nately the car was backed down the grade
only a minute or so before the train made
the crossing. In the scrimmage hats were
broken, ladles had their toilets disar
ranged and, most horrible of all, several
"dope" books with valuable notes about
future winners were irreparably damag-ed.

A WOMAN OF COURAGE.
Miss Agnes Meehan Weds Police Of

Sixteen Children.
Police Officer Denny Hayden, the pride
of the Southern station, who has adorned
the uniform of the force for the past twen
ty years, and who la the proud father of six
teen living and grown-up children, led
the blushing Agnes Meehan to the altar
before Mission Dolores Church on laft
Wednesday evening, and acoruing to the
rites of that church they were made man
and wife. The marriage license which au
thorized the good father to join them was
kept a profound secret by Cupid Dan
forth, fearing the public might know that
Miss Mechan waa about to assume charge
of Hayden and his sixteen young Hay
dens. The secret, however, leaked out,
and since then the courageous woman has
been flooded with congratulatory missives
from every officer on the force, besides
from all of her acquaintances in the city,
and they are numbered by the score.
The sprightly groom has turned his fif
ty-fifth birthday, while the bride has seen
forty-three summers. Both are hale and
hearty and enjoy their honeymoon with
all the novelty of a pair in their teens.
The Hayden household is delighted with
the novelty of having a young mother to
keep its members in subjection and to
care for the sixteen young ones, somÂ© of
whom are parents themselves.

COUNTING THE
COST OF THE
BIG NORTHER
The Chief Wharfinger
Tells What It Did.
MUCH REPAIRING NECESSARY
CHIEF OFFICER LAWLESS OF
THE AUSTRALIA HURT.
During Her Brief Career the Berke
ley Has Knocked Out 34 Piles
and Done Damage to the
Extent of ?2200.
The" Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday and considered the re
port of the chief -wharfinger and engineer
on the damage done by the recent norther.
At section 1 of the seawall the wharfinger's
office was slightly damaged and the fenc
ing knocked out of place. At section 2
the ship Miltonburn was lying, "and,"
says Chief "Wharfinger Boot in his report,
"for a distance of over 2r>o feet the fender
piles and stringers are broken and plank
ing supports driven inshore, caps removed
from bearings, supports of shed knocked
uut of place and shingles blown off the
shed, leaving this part of the seawall in a
very badly demoralized condition.
"At section 3 the ships Feleus and Ste
fano Razeto wore lyinpr, and about GOO
feet of the wharf is in a badly damaged
condition and unserviceable. The rock
bulkhead was washed away in some
places. Â
"At section 4 the damage was slight,
consisting of the loss of a few stringers
where the bark Amy Turner was lying.
"The incline at Fishermen's wharf,
which was in a bad condition prior to the
storm, was destroyed, a number of piles
carried away and ladder and railing bro
ken, leaving- the wharf In a very dilapi
dated condition. tt-Â«â
"The storm swayed the end of Lnlon
street wharf and it is now unsafe for the
class of work done on it.
"The float at Clay street wharf was
damaged, planking torn up and end of
gangplank badly broken.
"The dolphin between slips 5 and 6 at
the ferries was badly damaged.
"The damage at Mission 1 was confined
to the paving of the bulkhead and in
Spear street wharr the shed for a
space of 450x30 feet was carried away and
a number of skylights broken."
Superintendent of Urgent Repairs L-ong
has a force of carpenters at work at
Spear street wharf and it will be roofed
in again before the rain comes. The other
! wharves will be fixed up as quickly as
The transports Mohawk and Mobile that ;
are coming out here to carry the regu
lars to Manila and the volunteers home
are classed by Secretary Meiklejohn as-!
"model troopships" and as "specially
fitted for carrying troops to Manila." ;
This should be a feather in the cap of T.
Turner of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company, who went back East and fitted ;
them out. Turnrr put his patent bunks
in the Arizona, Scandia, Australia, Zea
landla, China, City of Peking and in all
the vessels that carried troops from here |
to Manila. Then he was cabled back East 'â¢
by the Government and fitted out the Mo
hawk and Mobile.
The record of the new ferry steamer
Berkeley on the water front is not an en
viable one. Since she has been in com
mission she has knocked thirty-four piles
out of the dolphins on this side and dam
aged the State property to the extent of ,
$2200. What she has done on the other
side of the bay the railroad company re- I
fuses to state.
The Mall steamer Australia sails for
Honolulu this afternoon with a light pas
senger list, caused by thf holiday season.
Among her cargo are a number of Christ
mas trees and a large consignment of or- '
anges and apples. Chief Officer Lawless
had a narrow escape Monday morning. He
lives in Aiameda, and was running to
catch a train, when the overhanging
bough of a tree caught him on the head.
i It pierced his hard hat, cut a scalp wound
i four inches long and knocked him sense
j less. He was taken home and a doctor
sent for. His head was bound up, and he
will be able to go out on the ship.
The British tramp steamer Ningchow,
from Astoria for Yokohama and Hong
kong, arrived at Yokohama yesterday
with her bulwarks smashed, two boats
carried away and cargo damaged.
Andrew Johnson is fond of peppermint
drops. Yesterday by accident a tabule of
bichloride of mercury got among his
drops and he swallowed it. He was
pumped out at the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital and Bent on his way rejoicing.
The following changes have taken place
among: captains: The steamer Alcatraz
Is now commanded by Captain G. M. Fa- '
gerlund and Captain T. Sunderson has
taken the steamer Alcazar. Captain An
| derson has taken command of the bark- i
I entine John Smith, now loading lumber
j at Chemaniuf, and Captain Kustel, who !
was taken sick at Port Townsend, will
return to San Francisco and take com- '-
mand of the barkentine Ruth. Captain
Calhoun, now on the bark Ceylon at Ta- '
coma, will come to San Francisco to re- '
lleve his son George on the barkentine I
Archer. George goes to the bark R. P
Rithet and Captain Edwards goes to Port
Blakeley to take command of the bark
Harvester.
Mrs. Barrios' Diamonds.
Mrs. Barrios spent an hour in the Ap
praiser's store yesterday afternoon select
ing some chang-es of lingerie from her
trunks. After having extracted several |
articles of lingerie of silk with Snjinish i
lace trimmings she took her diamond
Jewelry out and claimed that, it being for '
her personal adornment and being too 1
valuable for the use of a person in her
station in life, she was entitled to free !
entry of the articles. The diamonds are I
valued at about $100,000. The Appraiser i
has taken the matter \inder advisement.

NOTHING BUT
THE WOUNDS
CAUSED DEATH
Dr. Buteau's Strong
Testimony.
TWO DAYS OF QUESTIONING
XILLIANWAS BEATEN NOT LONG
BEFORE DEATH.
Brandes' Attorney Fails to Change
the Damaging Opinion Formed
at the Autopsy by en
Expert.
" Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 13.
Dr. S. H. Buteau answered questions for i
five hours to-day put to him by Attorney
J. E. Bennett, who is defending W. F.
Brandes on the charge of murdering his
daughter.
Attorney Bennett sought to prove that
rot any one of the bruises on Lilian's
body or head especially could have caused
death, also that they might have been in
flicted at a period before death longer
than that between the time of death and
ATTORNEY BENNETTâ With what kind of an instrument, in
your opinion, were these injuries inflicted on the head?
DR. S. H. BUTEAUâ A smooth, yielding instrument. They could
not have been inflicted by a fall down stairs or in any other way.
ATTORNEY BENNETTâ From the injuries apparent on the head
and body, do you think they were the cause of death?
BUTEAUâ I do. At the post mortem examination there was
nothing to indicate anything else.
BENNETTâ Did you examine the spinal cord? If not. why not?
BUTEAUâ I was looking for the cause of death and found a good
cause for it.
BENNETT â If this instrument (holding up the loaded billy with
â¢which Brandes is supposed to have murdered his daughter), in the
hands of this muscular man (telling Brandes to arise, which he did),
while in a condition of rage, were brought down on the head of a
13-year-old child, would death not, in your opinion, be instantaneous?
BUTEAU â I don't think that he could have killed her instantane
ously if he had hit her on the head with an ax. It would not have
been instantaneous death. â From the CrflM-ezas^naCton of the Expert in
the Brandes Munler Tria .
the last time Brandos beat her. The at
torney showed considerable knov ledge of
surgery, and he and the expert Wil
conversed for five hours on the appear
ance of wounds, the formation of the
tables of the skull at different ages, of ex
terior and interior wounds and of the
cause of certain pathological conditions
which were found in the skull of the
murdered girl.
Dr. Buteau testified that he found two
wounds on the skull of which there was
no exterior indication. The attorney tried
to make the doctor say that such wounds
were the result of shock and not of blows,
hut Dr. Buti-au said that this theory could
not possibly account for the condition of
Lillian's head. "Either of the wounds
said the witness, "if they were neglected
might produce death. But neituer of
them would be considered fatal by a
physician who was called in to attend
them as soon as they were Inflicted."
The whole day vas taken up with the
cross-examination of Dr. Buteau. He
â was a very courteous and obliging wit
ness never seeming to be annoyed by the
almost Interminableness of questions, but
rather seaming to enter Into the interest
of the BUbject as though he were a witness
having B personal Interest in the case and
not merely an expert.
The testimony of Dr. Buteau will close
the prosecution, which has now con
pumed .i S ht days. The defense has not
vet indicated what witnesses it will bring
forward but from to-day's proceedings
It Is very evident that it Intends to rely
largely o*n argument for which the foun
dation has been laid In the cross-ex
amination of Dr. Buteau. Attorney Ben
nett's line of questioning showed that he
Js striving to make it appear that Lillian
Brandes may have fallen downstairs and
sustained a concussion that produced
death, and that the wounds found on her
are merely superficial, of uncertain, age.
and cannot be traced to the brutality of
her father.
BABY ENOS DRINKS
CARBOLIC ACID
DIED AFTER AN HOUR OF FEAR
FUL AGONY.
JThe Poison Found by the Little Fel

Play.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Dec. 13.
Little Baby Enos. two years of age.
drank carbolic acid this morning and an
hour later was a corpse.
The Enos family lives at 1658 Sixteenth
Btreet and the mother, according to her
Statement, always keeps a small supply
of family medicines in the house. They
are stored in a trunk, but it was not lock
ed, nobobdy anticipating that the child
â¢would discover it.
After breakfast the little boy was play
ing In the house and unnoticed he opened
the medicine box. Tie played for a while
with the bottles nnd finally took out a
vial of carbolic acid, the contents of
â which he drank. His scream^ attracted
the attention of his mother who at once
Â«aw what had been done and secured the
attendance of Dr. Huntington. The little
fellow's mouth nnd throat were severely
burned and much of the fluid had gone
into the stomach, the injuries belne so
virile that none of the remedies afforded
any relief and the little one died after an
hour of frightful suffering.
BIG BLAZE AT STJNOL.
Buildings Destroyed and Mrs. Ram
baud Has a Narrow Escape.
OAKLAND. Dec. 13.â At 5:30 o'clock this
morning Suno! was visited by a damaging
fire, which destroyed several buildings in
the center of town and almost resulted in
the loss of one life. . ;_
The blaze was lirst discovered in the
two-story frame building owned by A..
Rambaud. The lower portion of tlie build
ing is used as a saloon and the upper por
tion as a lodging house. Mrs. Rambaud's
rocm was on the second floor, and the
flames cut off every means of escape from
her room and she appeared at a window
screaming for help. Finally several men
secured a ladder and rescued the woman,
who was about overcome with smoke.
The building was a total loss, as were
also several houses adjoining. The origin
of the fire is unknown. An effort was
made to fight the flames, but no water
could be secured.

ALL PARTIES
ARE LOADING
THEIR GUNS
Oakland Again in a
Sea of Politics.
POPULISTS GONE ASTRAY
MUNICIPAL LEAGUE ON A
BROADER BASIS.
Republicans to Decide Whether the
Convention Delegates Shall Be
Appointed or Elected at
Primaries.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, I
90S Broadway. Dec 13.
The opening of the city campaign by !
the Municipal League has stimulated
other parties to action, and on Thursday
evening the Republican City Central j
Committee will meet and discuss the ;
method of calling a convention.
George R. Williams, the chairman, has ,
called a meeting for Thursday evening.
Mr. Williams represents the Seventh ;
Ward, and he has been asked by the Sev- j
enth Ward Republican Club to use his in-
fluence toward having the delegates ap
pointed by a committee and not elected at
primaries.
"Both systems have their drawbacks
and can be abused," said Chairman Wil
liams. In holding primaries the principal
objection is that a great many people not
Republicans vote. In the system of ap
pointing delegates there is also much
room for abuse. The committee having
the power to appoint can name delegates
whom they know to be favorable to cer
tain candidates, and this abuse cannot be
avoided. It might be obviated to some
extent if the committee was chosen by
lot. Nothing has yet been done regarding
our city campaign, but we will get down
to business on Thursday. Personally, 1
am In favor of retaining good men In of
fice, regardless of their politics, so far as
municipal affairs go."
The Republican City Central Commit
tee is composed of George R. Williams,
president; M. D. Merritt, chairman;
George S. Meredith, C. 1.,. Wagner. E. N.
Lake, H. D. Carlton and Dan W. Doody.
The Municipal League has already in
dicated what its platform will be. It will
not only include a demand for honesty in
the city government but will advocate
permanent improvements and the acquisi
tion of parks. This Is a radical departure
from the principles of the league in the
past. Six years ago It was instrumental
in defeating park and boulevard bonds.
Two years ago it all but declared against
the policy of buying land for public parks.
Now It Is in favor of procuring public
parks provided this can De done without
a suspicion of a job by real estate men.
The People's party is without a head.
C. T. Johns is chairman of the City Cen
tral Committee, but he voted the Republi
can ticket at the last election, and when
asked to-day what part the party would
take next spring he said: "As tar as I
can see, the People's party is on the
wane. It has not lived up to its princi
ples. There are too many people in it as
In other parties who are looking for the
loaves and fishes and who take very little
interest in the party. 1 think now that
it will be the Republican party that will
work out the salvation of the country.
At first I thought it was to be the prov
ince of the People's party, because they
put up the best platform. But they have
not lived up to it. and I have renounced
it. I have not yet handed In my resigna
tion as chairman of the city committee,
but I voted for the Republicans at the
last election and I cannot tell what are
the prospects of the People's party."
A. T. Macdonough, chairman of the
Democratic City Central Committee, hatÂ»
one conviction firmly enthroned in his
mind. There will be no fusion with the
Populists.
In discusÃlng the matter this morning
Chairman Macdonough said, "We shall
probably meet early in January. We have
not yet "mapped out any particular line of
campaign, but I hardly think it neces
sary to say that there will be no fusion
and consequently less confusion. Al
though admitting that the State election
was rather disastrous from a Democratic
point of view, I consider it only one of
those upheavals which occur periodically
and which have the effect of stimulating
greater efforts in the future. The Demo
i cratic party proposes to put men on the
ticket in whom the people have con
fidence. Several names have already been
mentioned as possible candidates for
Mayor. Among these are Dr. A. Fine,
Seth Mann, chalrmaun of the State Cen
tral Committee; Ex-Mayor C. D. Piercfl
j and F. P. McFeely."
It is probable that the Municipal league
will nominate five of the present Council
men, vt*: Cuvellier. Girard, Rowe, Upton
and Pringle, and their candidate for May
or will either be John F. Towle. Giles H.
Gray. Arthur H. Breed or J. W. Nelson,
while Frank Mott may also be considered
in the race. As all these men are well
known Republicans, it is very evident that
the league intends to anticipate some of
the Republican nominations. Auditor
Snow would probably be nominated by
the league for Mayor if he would consent,
but it Is more than likely that when he
is nominated for Mayor he would prefer it
at the hsinds of a straight Republican
convention. John F. Towle was placed In
nomination for Mayor at the last Republi
can city convention and beaten by Mayoi
Thomas, and as he is an active member
of the league, it is apparent that he would
prefer the league to a party nomination.
"It was hoped that we could keep poll
tics out of our minds until after Christ
mas." said a politician to-day, "but it
was impossible and Oakland is again Ir
her element."

A WOMAN SPRINGS
FROft/l THE FERRY DECK
Mystery of the Steamer Garden City
During a Night Trip to
Alameda.
Shortly after the ferry-boat Garden
City left the dock on her 10:15 o-'clock
trip to Alameda. a gentleman standing
in the forward part of the boat noticed
a woman acting rather strangely in the
saloon. He turned toward her. but as
he did so she ran out hurriedly past
him. He heard a splash and a cry,
and, looking out, saw an arm stretched
out above the water, and the cry, this
time muffled, was repeated. He at
once gave the alarm, the engines were
stopped, boats lowered' and a thorough
search made, but no trace of the woman
could be found. The only clew to her
identity is an umbrella left in the sa
loon. It is an ordinary black umbrella,
with a handle shaped like a shepherd's
crook.

Dockery Again on a Raid.
Dockery, the terrible, accompanied by
his sturdy henchman, Ben Davis, was on
the warpath again last night. During the
early part of the evening he stopped for
ty-three milk wagons and took samples.
At North Beach he encountered two loads
which contained milk so badly adulter
ated that he dumped the contents in the
gutters and arrested the drivers of the
wagons. The men were locked up at the

THE THEATER WALL FALLING
LUCKY Baldwin is keeping pood his promise, and the smoke be
grimed monument of his former glory, the shrine of his early
pride, as It were, is beginning to totter in earnest. The walls that
he reared and which since the fire have been a menace to the public
safety are being rapidly leveled to the ground. Yesterday at 1:25 o'clock
the large middle wall that separated the hotel proper from the theater
was pulled down. During- the leveling of this wall all traffic on Market and
Powell streets was stopped for fear that some one might be injured by the
falling debris. Sergeant Donovan with a squad of police kept the streets
cleared and prevented the curious public from approaching too near to the
building. For a while the cars were not allowed to pass the ruins of the
hotel, and all vehicles were turned back or else held in check by the police.
It was generally known that an attempt would be made at 1 o'clock to
tear down this middle wall, and the streets Â»vere crowded with people.
Nearly every window in the Emporium was filled with occupants, while
the tops of the buildings along Powell and Ellis streets were black with
people who were anxious to see the monument of brick and mortar
brought to terra firma.
The wall in question was about ninety feet in height. It intersected
the main wall of the hotel that ran parallel to Powell street at a point
about midway of the hotel. At the point and top of where tlie two walls
intersected was the huge 100,000 gallon water tank. A steel cable was
passed through one of the top windows in the wall and this was connected
with a windlass on the top of the annex of the hotel. The cable was got
through the window by the means of a life-saving gun. First a small rope
w;is fired through the window, and this was attached to the cable, which
was thus pulled through. It took very little power to start the wall, and
when it began to fall it broke in the middle and came down with a crash.
A blinding cloud of brick and mortar dust followed the collapse of the wall,
which was successfully thrown without hurting any one. Baldwin hopes
to have all of the walls down by the end of the week.
THE DEATH OF
H, C, SUKEFORTH
YET A MYSTERY
Must Remain a Matter
of Conjecture.
NO TRACE OF POISON FOUND
PHYSICIANS PUT FORWARD AN
EXPLANATION.
But. Nothing Positive Shown As to
How the Young University
Student's Life Was
Ended.
BERKELEY, Dec. 13.â There is still a
cloud of mystery hanging over the death
of Harold C. Sukeforth, the youngr uni
versity student who was found lifeless in
his room at 1404 Henry Btreet yesterday
morning. Although the Coroner's Inquest
Is over, and all legal Inquiry thereby at
an end, there is still much about the case
that Is unsatisfactory and for which no
adequate explanation can be given.
The conclusion reached to-day by Drs.
Woolsey, Hoagland and Kelsey, the phy
sicians conducting the autopsy, was to
the effect that the young man's death was
not due to poison. No traces of any deadly
drug could be found In the contents of
the stomach, which had been subjected to
a rigid chemical test. No trace, more
over, of any poisonous substance could b
found in any part of the body. All theo
ries of suicide connected with poisoning
were therefore set aside, and no furthe
attempt will be made to exploit the cas
in that direction. It was completely dls
carded at the Inquest held to-night*
A second autopsy this afternoon cover
Ing practically the ground gone over yes
terday, conlirmed the report that the or
gans of the body were in no abnorma
condition. The suggestion at first offerer
that Sukeforth was addicted to an exces
sive use of tobacco finds but littl
substantiation in the post mortem con
elusions of the physicians. While th
heart was found to be rather large and in
a somewhat flabby state, this condition, i
California-street station, where they pave
their names as J. Brennan and Zeno
Gworder. Samples of milk have been
I taken from eighty hotels, saloons, gro
; cerie-s and restaurants, and it was found
! that the milk was below the standard in
forty-two out of the eighty.
Contracts Awarded.
Th t e Fire and Police Committee of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday accepted
the Goodyear Rubber Company's bid of
$1990 for a combination chemical engine
and hose wagon.
The Orpheum Company was granted
permission to swing an electric sign from
the front of the Orpheum building on
U'Farrell streer.
W. T. Garratt & Co. were awarded the
contract to furnish two monitor batteries
at a cost of $1790.
The contract to build a fire engine house
at the corner of Tenth avenue and J
street was let to J. Sheibley, who bid
$5700.
The committee reported favorably a
petition of the Fire Department to have
forty new fire plugs placed in the district
bounded by Larkin, Suiter, Market and
Powell.
W. B. Hayward's Baby.
When the cases of "W. B. Hay ward, the
father of the dead baby that was dis
covered among the refuse at the Crem
atory, and Antone Brignolo and G. Rosso,
the two scavengers who took the baby to
the Crematory, were called in Judge Mo
gan s court yesterday, their attorneys
raised the point that there was no at
tempt to intpr the body outside a ceme
tery as required by the Penal Code It
was argued that a crematory was not a
cemetery within the nu'anio'g of the law.
The Judge said he would consider the
point and give his derision to-day.
Bankrupt Mechanics.
Ray C. Hopkins, a mechanic working
In the railroad shops in Sacramento, filed
a petition yesterday in insolvency In the
United States Court. His liabilities are
$967 85 and his assets $138 50. J. F. Love
land, a mechanic working in the railroad
shops in Oakland, tiled a petition also.
His liabilities are $615 50 and his assets
$145, wages due him from the company,
and which he claims Is exempt because
necessary for the maintenance of his
family.
Fell Dead at His Doorstep.
William A. Nichols, a carpenter, 4S
years of age, residing at 1515% Mission
street, died at his home last evening, pre
sumably from heart disease. His brother,
with whom he lived, says that Nichols
was going up the steps to the house when
he seemed to be taken with a fainting fit.
He fell down the stairs, and when picked
up was dead. He had been troubled with
his heart for some time.
More' Cigars on the Curacao.
Customs inspectors made another
seizure on the Curacao yesterday morn-
Ing: of 1425 cigars. On the day pre
vious 4500 cigars were seized. It has
been the practice for the Curacao on her
way up from Mexico to stop at San Diego
and Redondo. On the present trip the
Curacao did not stop at these ports, and
thereiore there was no opportunity to
land the smuggled cigars. .
Railroad Men Deny a Report.
Third Vice-President J. C. Stubhs of the
Southern Pacific, when seen yesterday
afternoon and asked if there was any
truth in the report that the Southern Pa
cific was trying: to purchase the Virginia
and Truckeo and Carson and Colorado
Railroads, replied that there was not.
The rumor Is also denied by D. O. Mills,
who practically controls the" roads.
Is said, need not necessarily have resulted
from the effects of smoking, but was
probably due to other causes. Many of
the young man's friends now deny that he
smoked excessively, although there are
several who still maintain to the contrary.
It was agreed by all the doctors that to
bacco alone could not have caused his
death.
It was also brought out by the testi
mony of witnesses that Sukeforth was
never In the habit of using drugs, that
nothing Is known of his having gone to a
drug store to purchase them, nor have
any of his friends given him any at
any time. It was further shown that no
bottles or traces of a drug of any kind
could be found in the room or about the
young man's clothes. Thus, while this
theory will be generally accepted, the na
ture of the drug and the manner of ob
taining it can only be matters of conjec
ture. And the mystery of the young
student's early death can never, there-
Jectu anvtnln & more than mere con
â¦ u The Coroner's jury, after listening to
the evidence offered, returned a verdict
that death was due to some cause or
causes unknown.
The junior class of the university, of
which Sukeforth was a member, passed
resolutions of respect and esteem.
\\. H. Sukeforth, the boy's father ar
rived in Berkeley at a late hour last
night. He left with the remains this
evening for his home in Nevada City
where the Interment will take place
FOUND A SCORE
OF SKELETONS
STRANGE DISCOVERY OF OFFI-
CER KAMP.
Unearthed the Bones of Ancient In
dian Warriors While Hunting
in Contra Costa Marshes.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 13.â Police Officer Al-
I bert Kamp of this city unearthed a num
j her of Indian relics and a score of skele
tons of ancient warriors while on a hunt
ing trip yesterday near Brentwood. Con
tra Costa County. In traveling through
the tules he came across a sand mound
about three feet high and six feet square
at the base. Noticing several human
bones protruding from the mound he
scraped away the sand and unearthed a
pile of skeletons. They were placed one
on the other without any pretext to ar
rangement.
"There must have been at least twenty
i skeletons,' said Mr. Kamp, to-day, "and
the bones were all in a perfect statÂ« nt
preservation. One peculiarity about the
nkulls was that nearly all of them bore
I evidence of having been crushed with a
I tomahawk or some other sharp lnstru
' merit."
In his investigations Mr. Kamp found
I several tools, used by the aborigines,
; which they made from elk horns. He
j learned that there is a tradition around
Brentwood that the Indians who once
dwelt there fought a bloody battle in the
vicinity years before the white men set
tled in the country. The mound discov-
I ered by Mr. Kamp is supposed to be the
I burial place of the sialn, although its ex
| istence was not known to the oldest in
| habitant of that section of Contra Costa
I county. Mr. Kamp brought home a per
: feet skull and cro.ssbones and several elk
; horn bodkins, which the Indians used in
sewing. The re! lea will be presented to
Senator E. K. Taylor.
Arson to Hide Another Crime.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 13.â A barn at 3014 En
cinal avenue, belonging to Senator E. K.
Taylor, was burned to the- ground yes
terday and there is now a strong sus
i nicion that some one committed arson to
i hide a crime. Lord Alfred Scott, a mem
ber of the British nobility who has been
residing in this city, stored a valuable
carriage and harness in the building.
Just before the fire Sunday a young man
was seen running away from the stable
carrying the harnrss. A few moments
later the structure burst into flames.
Lord Scott stated to a Call reporter to
day that he has evidence that the barn
was robbed of Its contents and then fired
to conceal the crime.

Performs Ceremony.
"I pronounce you man and wife."
As the fateful words that made young
Birhard C. Stoddard and pretty 16-year
old Irma E. Wilson one- fell from the lips
of Justice of the Peace J. E. Barry yes
terday afternoon in his chambers the cur
tain fell on a little domestic drama that
threatened to develop into a tragedy. The
brief marriage ceremony was the finale to
a series of exciting incidents in the lives
of the two young people during the last
ten days, in which the furious father,
threatening vengeance on the author of
his daughter's supposed wrongs and a
mother's love for her offspring and her
confidence in the honor of the youth
whom she had known from childhood,
were promlent figures. But now all is
per<=ne. The heartache of the mother has
been eased, the young people are appa
rently happy and the anger of the father,
if not already dissipated, will gradually
pass away after he becomes reconciled to
the humiliation of having been totally
ignored in the final consummation of the
matrimonial intentions of his daughter
and her well-meaning but imprudent
lover.
For the past two weeks J. P. Wilson,
whose residence is in Applegate, Placer
County, has been raging around town like
n. mad bull, swearing that he would per
forate the dandy looking railway mail
clerk unless the latter should forthwith
make his promise to marry Wilson's
daughter, whom the Applegate capitalist
claimed he had ruined. Stoddard was
kept on the run, dodging the irate parent,
and the girl became so frightened at the
turn affairs were taking that she tele
graphed for her mother, Mrs. Overly of
Reno. Nev. Mrs. Overly hastened to San
Francisco, arriving here a week .ago, and
had an Interview with Stodd"ard, her
daughter being present. The young man
pleaded for a little time in which to put
his affairs in shape. The mother accepted
his assurances and he departed on his
"run" to Ogden last Friday. When the
girl's father heard of the conference to
which ho had not been invited and found
that the object of his wrath had left the
city his anger knew no bounds. But he
tijj heipless to do any damage until
lard Fhoi:id return to the city, as the
mother was the legal guardian of the
child, and she alone coula invoke the aid
of the iaw. -which she declined to do. Con
sequently Mr. Wilson put his artillery In
orcer and waited.
Stoddard was due to arrive in San

Mrs. Overly also announced that she
would be at the depot when the train

possible murder.
Ip to this time the affair had been kept
from the public, but the whole story was
published exclusively in Tie Call yester
day morning, and its publication caused
consternation among all parties con

former wife being on hand to "welcome"
young Stoddard. an army of reporters
were gathered under the railway compa
ny's sheds to greet the Bmooth-faced
youth whose name is carried on the pay
rolls of Uncle Sam's postal department.
But The Call, with the story of what had
been done and what was proposed, was
ahead of them, and as the train pulled
into the depot Stoddard slipped off on
the other side of the cars and made his
escape, while his fellow-clerks pulled tne
wool over the eyes of the reporters.
As soon as Stoddard could make him
self presentable he hastened to the Hotel
Ramona to consult with his sweetheart
and her mother. The result of the con
ference was the trip to the marriage
license clerk at the City Hall and the
subsequent ceremony that put an end to
his troubles, including any danger of be
ing wiped off the face of the earth, tem
porarily at least. The bridal party con
sisted of the bride and groom, Mrs.
Overly, the bride's mother, and a fellow
clerk of Stoddard, who acted as best man.
Stoddard certainly did not act like a man
who was taking upon himself the serious
responsibilities that married life entails.
He even neglected to kiss the bride when
Judge Barry pronounced the final words
that bound them together for better or
for worse, and as soon as he could con
veniently do so he excused himself, prom
ising to rejoin his bride at the Ramona
later in the evening.
He hurried to a telegraph office and
sent a message to his father at Reno, say-
Ing he had been compelled to marry the
girl. Then he proceeded to celebrate the
"joyful" event in a manner that proba
bly caused him to forget all about his
engagement with his newly made wife.
His friends say positively He will not live
with his bride, and that he told her so at
Mrs. Overly is greatly distressed over
the publicity which has been given to the
affair and the allegation that the mar
i riage was forced upon Stoddard.
"It is all Wilson's fault." she said. "Ho
has been going around town threatening'
Dick's life and acting in such a manner
as to create the Impression that there
i was something wrong in their relations,
I when there was really no good ground for
| such suspicion. Matters finally reached
such a stage that I came on here to see
what I could do. I had a talk with Dick,
and ho told me frankly that he could not
afford to marry just now and I agreed
with him. Dick and Irma have been en-
I paged for several months, but they did
not Intend to get married until Irma's
seventeenth birthday, which will be on
May 2. 3899. After Dick left for Ogden on
his run last Friday. Wilson came tearing
to me, swearing terribly and making all
kinds of threats, until I was thoroughly
frlghtened. He declared he would moet
Dick at the train with a gun and force
him to marry Irma, I determined to be
there too and prevent trouble if possible,
but I changed my mind. Dick Is a noble
young man and has actf-d throughout In a
most honorable manner. He came to me
yesterday after he arrived in the city and
asked what was to de done, now that the
public had been made aware of what was
going on through Wilson's actions. We
talked it over and decided that they had
better get married at once. There was no
threats of force about It. It was a
voluntary marriage, and I believe they
will be happy together. Of course, as
Dick is In debt, mey will not live to
gether for the present. I shall take Irma
nome to Reno with me to-morrow, and
when Dick Is in a position to provide for
a wife they will make their home In this
city. I wish you would say that there Is
not a word of truth in the story that
Irma had been wronged. That was only
a suspicion caused by Wilson's reckless
talk. Irma had been living with me until
about a month ago. when I sent her to
her father at his ureent request. Sh* has
been stopping for several wwks with her
father and sister. Myrtle, at the home of
her aunt, Mrs. McDonald, at 610 Jones
street. Mr. Stoddard has known her
since childhood and he took her out a
great deal. In going afcout together at
night as much as they did they were un
doubtedly indiscreet, but there was noth
ing wrong and Wilson simply made a fool
of himself."
Mr. Wilson has been apparently lost in
the shuffle. He was not at the depot with
his gun and he was not at the wedding
he was so determined to brin* about. He
may still be hunting for Stoddard and he
may have betaken himself and his gun to

the hills of Placer county. At all events
the work he cut out for himself has been
accomplished without his aid, and he will
have to content himself with that fact.
Stoddard gave his age to the marriage
license clerk as 22 years, and his residence
532 Gough street. He formerly resided at
I that address, but has not lived there for
nearly three months.
"I met her as I would have met any
other woman." was the only explanation
the bridegroom gave. "She was a friend
of Mrs. Coffin, and Mrs. Coffin was a
schoolmate of mine. Last May I met Mrs.
Coffin in this city and with her was a
young woman. The young woman was
irma Wilson. I met her two or three
times in the company of Mrs. Coffin and
a man named Clancy, a jockey at the
race track. I became friendly with her,
and got to know her quite well.
"I have never seen Mr. Wilson. I ex
pected to see him in the crowd at the
mole thl? morning, but as I did not know
him I suppose I passed him by.
"When I came off the train I knew the
story had got out. There was a big
crowd waiting on our side of the train
and I got out on the other, and I went
right on to the boat.
"When I had reported off at the office
I went to my room, and after changing
my clothes I walked ,down to the Lang
ham Hotel. As I crossed the corner of
Mason street I saw Miss Wilson and her
mother at the windows of the Ramona on
Ellis street. Miss Wilson beckoned me
to come up. I had to meet them some
time, so I went up and had a talk with
the girl and her mother.
"Mrs. Overly told me that the old man
would surely kill me. She told me he had
been carrying a revolver for me for a
week and she said I had better fix things
up, as ho was laying for me and would
make trouble if I did not make things
"I had a long conference with Miss Wil-
son and her mother and finally I agTeed
to go to the County Clerk's office and get
out a license. 1 thought it was the best
thing I could do under the circumstances.
"I met the girl as I would have met any
one else on the street. I did not know her
in Reno. I met her occasionally at Mrs.
Coffin's rooms on O'Farrell street. One
evening when I wffK there Clancy came in
and then he and Mrs. Coffin left and we
(Miss Wilson and I) were alone.
"She was down here on a visit, I under
stood, and when I asked her how long she
would stay she said as long as she want
ed. I went up to the Royal Eagle with her
one night and there I registered as Rich
ard Stoddard and wife.
"Last Thursday I saw Mrs. Overly. She
said she would stand by me if I would do
the right thing by the girl. I said I
would. Friday morning she came to me
and said the only thing T could do was to
marry her daughter. I was going out on
the road Friday and so I asked her to
wait and I would tell her. Just before I
went away 1 received a note signed J. P.
Wilson, paying, 'You had better not go
out until you see me.' I went out without
seeing any one.
"On the way dgwn this morning I was
going to get off at Sixteenth street, Oak
land, to avoid trouble, but then I decided
to go to the mole for I did not think there
would be anything out of the way. When
we got to the mole the boys on the Oregon
< ppres hailed us and yelled out 'There has
been an expose,' and then I know there
was something in the wind.
"When the train stopped I got off on the
side opposite to that on which the crowd
had gathered, and I got on the boat with
out any trouble.
"So far as Irma Wilson Is concerned T
never knew her until I met her In this
city. I did not think she was only 16
years old. I would not have had any
thing to do with her if I thought she was
so young. She told me she was 18 and
I believed her. I never promised to marry
her. I had no thoughts of marying her
until her mother met me yesterday and
asked me to do so. I never saw the old
man, Mr. Wilson, but Mrs. Overly told
me he would surely kill me If I did not
marry the girl. I was sick of the whole
thing. I was not willing to raise a scan
dal and soâ well, you know how It isâ l
didn't think I was to blame but there
was only one way out of itâ andâ l mar
ried her."

GOOD RECORD
MADE BY THE
CUSTOM ROUSE
Cargoes Rapidly Han
dled Here.
WORK DONE DAY AND NIGHT
BLUNDER MADE BY TWO DIS
GRUNTLED BROKERS.
Outside Examinations Are Held for
the Purpose of Expediting the
Landing oi. Holiday
Goods.
Two Custom-house brokers are com
plaining against what they term unneces
sary delays in getting imported merchan
dise through the Appraiser's department.
The allegation is made that the cargo,
consisting of silks, of the British ship
Shangtung, which vessel arrived on No
vember 14, was not taken out of the Ap
praiser's store until a day or two ago.
They also affirm that the cargo of the
Duchess Annie, which vessel arrived Oc
tober 28, is still in the basement of the
Appraiser's building.
The fact that the Coptic arrived on No
vember 21 and work was not begun on her
before last Saturday has been set forth
also as a cause of complaint by the dis
satisfied brokers.
The manner in which the Overland
Transfer Company is carrying out its con
tract is another item in the complaint,
and the statement is made that the com
pany makes the Custom-house business
play second violin to its other business. In
other words, that it hauls goods to the
Appraiser's store whenever there is noth
ing else for It to do. As a result of this
discrimination it is said that there are big
piles of merchandise lying on the wharves
awaiting the pleasure of the company to
be transported to the Appraiser's build
ing for examination and release. All these
incidents and conditions have worried the
two brokers, and they are complaining
loudly because of the delay.
John T. Dare, the Appraiser, his assist
ant. Jacob Shaen, and Mr. Stevens ex
pressed surprise that the complaints
should have b< >'ii made. Mr. Shaen said
that he had recently visited the custom
houses in New Yen:, Boston and .Phila
delphia and had carefully examined their
workings. The result of that examination
was his conviction thai in the San Fran
cisco Custom-house goods were rushed
through more expeditiously and with less
trouble to importers than was the case
with the Eastern custom-houses.
"In order to accommodate the mer
chants." continued Mr. Shaen, "I have
been going- outside appraising goods be
fore they reach the < ustom-housa in or
der to hurry along the holiday stock. I
have been doing this for the past two
months. Of course everybody wants the
holiday wares taken out at this time, and
the importers are willing to wait for the
other claÂ«Â«es <>f merchandise. We are
working until late at night and even on
Sunday to oblige Importers."
With reference to the complaint against
the Duchess Annie. Mr. Stevens said that
the rule has been from time immemorial
to wait until a sailing vessel Is finally dis
charged before her cargo is passed. She
is loaded with rice, birds' nests, Chinese
gin and preserved ginger, not designed for
the Christmas holiday trade. Owing to
the present crippled state of the boilers
only half the elevators in the Appraiser's
bnildlnp are running, and there is some
delay on account of that fact. The boilers
were shut down for repairs for ten days
recently and that Is why there was some
delay in passing upon the cargo of the
Shangtung vessel.
From other sources it was learned that
the complaints originated with two bro
kers, one of whom is known as a
grumbler. Barring the defective eleva
tor service, with which Appraiser Dare
has nothing to do. the business of the Ap
praiser is in ship shape condition, and

Tie.
At Recreation Tnrk this afternoon the
representative teams of Belmont and of
Lowell High schools will test their re
spective ability in a gridiron battle to set
tle the championship of the Amateur
Academic League. A week ago last Sat
urday the teams met for the same pur
pose, but so evenly did they play that the
game resulted in a tic, the score read-
Ing 5 to 5.
Since, that time the Lowell eleven and
the Belmonts have been grinding out the
hours on the field trying to improve them
selves for the battle of to-day. Coaches
from Berkeley and Palo Alto have been
visiting both places and giving the
youngsters the benefit of their caching.
Belmont's team will not appear on the
field In the best physical condition. Some
of its best material has suffered Injuries
of a weakening character, especially in
the case of Roberts, whose skull was
crushed in the last game. Lowell is in
fine shape and ready to fight for the
palms of championship glory.

McGLADE IS
INDICTED FOR
RANK FORGERIES
Grand Jury Finds Two
Charges.
AMBROSE TELLS HIS STORY
SCHOOL BOARD INVESTIGATION
FINALLY DROPPED.
Adjournment Will Probably Be
Taken on Next Friday After
noon â Attorney Dunne Files
His Report.
Peter McGlade, defaulting deputy of
the Street Department, the man who
betrayed the implicit trust of hi 3 friend
and employer, Superintendent of
Streets Ambrose, and robbed the city
of hundreds of dollars by means of
fraudulent and forced warrants, was
last night Indicted by the Grand Jury
upon a charge of forgery. The indict
ment included two counts; one for
forging the name of T. B. McGlnnis, a
deputy In the office of the clerk of the
Board of Supervisors, the other for
forging a warrant upon the City and
County of San Francisco, After bring
ing the indictment the jury wound up
its evening's session by deciding to
meet on Friday afternoon for the pur
pose of requesting Judge Belcher to
declare it adjourned.
The jury's investigation into the case
of McGladp was neither a matter of
difficulty nor of_ much time. Detective
Thomas B. Gibson, who has had charge
of tf?e case, had his testimony so ar
ranged and his witnesses so well
rounded up that all the evidence to be
taken was in hand within an hour,
and hall of the twenty-six witnesses
who had turned up in answer to sub
penas were dismissed without being
heard. Supervisors Haskins, Rivers
and Rottanzi of the Finance Commit
tee were the first heard, but their evi
dence was of no importance. They
were followed by Superintendent of
Streets Ambrose.
Mr. Ambrose made a frank, open
statement of every phase of the case
of which he was cognizant. It was
the first time that he had consented to
speak fully of what he knew of Mc-
Glade and his transactions, and his
plain statement convinced the -Jury,
were it not already convinced, that the
Superintendent and his office is not in
any way blamable, no matter what
unwarranted insinuations have appear
ed to the contrary.
Mr. Ambrose did not spare McGlade.
He told the jury that the former
deputy's position in the office was not
a political appointment, that he had
always been one of his warmest friends
and had always trusted him in the full
est and that the position had been
given him on the basis of that friend
ship. He explained how it had been
possible for McGlade to take blank
warrants from the office, but he stated
that he had never given him authority
to use his name. Mr. Ambrose also
exonerated any of the employes of his
office from complicity in his deputy's
crimes, and with that statement he was
dismissed.
Auditor Broderick and Thomas B.
McGinnls were also examined, as was
Expert Kytka, who testified that all
of the names, save those of McGlade
and the members of the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors had
been forged. McGlade's signature was
genuine, and the bod of the bogus
warrants was written in his handwrit
ing. Kytka said he had discovered
seventy-five forgeries in all, and that
he deems McGlade guilty of them.
The investigation into School Board
crookedness has been finally dropped.
The jury decided to have nothing more
to do with it, upon the advice of Dis
trict Attorney Dunne, who reported
that any indictment brought for an in
fringement against the one-twelfth act
would be dropped through lack of both
evidence and sufficient law. The jury
will be probably finally adjourned on
Friday afternoon.

A MERCHANT
WAS INVISIBLE
TO OFFICERS
He Long Escaped De
tection by Them.
Henry A. Boyd, alias Hanson Boyakin,
alias Henderson A. Boyakin, as he is vari
ously mentioned in the court papers in
the big Federal building, has earned the
added title of "the invisible Boyakin,"
and his name was stricken from the
criminal records ot the United States Dis
trict Court yesterday by a nolle pros, en
tered by United States Attorne- Foote.
Mr. Foote stated that his action had
been advised by the Commissioner of
Pensions, and the charge against the in
visible, defendant was accordingly dis
missed and his bail bond of $2500 ex
onerated.
Boyakin's court history is an amusing
illustration of the manner in which a
lucky man may evade the officers of the
law, simply by remaining at home and
carrying on his business as usual.
Boyakin was indicted by the Ignited
States Grand Jury on April 2, IS&S, as
Henry Boyd, alias Henson Boyakin, for
procuring false affidavits concerning his
claim for a pension. A bench warrant
was issued on the same day, and it was
placed in the hands of the "United States
Marshal. He could not find Boyd, and
on January 7. lKPrt. the warrant was re
turned as unserved.
Late in September, 1597, his mother, who
had been a witness before the Grand
Jury in the case, called at the clerk's
office of the United States District Court
for her fees, and in. answer to questions
put by Deputy Clerk John Pottira replied
that her son was keeping a coal yard at
3612 Nineteenth street. She was surprised
to hear that he was wanted by the
authorities and could not be foun^., for n:
name was in the City Directory and his
address was there also, he having kept
a coal yard at that place for seven y' e ;"" F
The next morning Boyakin walked into
the clerk's office and said that he had
learned through the issue of The Call or
the day before that he had been indicted
two or three years before, and he wanted
to know something about it. He iur
nished bonds and went home.
Then he became invisible again. It was
not until six months later that ne was
arraigned, and from that time until yes
terday the case slept on the ca.endar. In
the meantime the principal for
the prosecution had died, and the Govern
ment, realizing that no con% ; lct }Â°Ji a c '^
