THE GIGANTIC CONSPIRACY THAT
WRECKED THE McDONALD BANKS
Startling Revelations
in the Secret Records
of the Institutions
Falsification of the
Books to Conceal
Robbery,
Documents That Tell a
New Story of a
Great Crime.
The Call is In a. position this morning
to begin an expose of most startling
importance to this city and State.
For over five years the secret history j
of the events that culminated in the de
struction of the Pacific Bank and the
People's Home Savings Bank has been
hidden from public view. The docu- I
merits and correspondence that would |
have revealed the gigantic conspiracy
of a coterie of scheming gamblers an i
unprincipled thieves were stolen before
the authorities could secure them. !
This correspondence will now be given
to the public, that the conspirators may
receive their deserts and the robbed de
positors of both banks may recover j
some of their property that was stolen j
from them by the dishonest bankers I
and the'-.- parasitic scl tmers.
This new history of the ruin of these j
banks is In every respect a revelation
and the story will divide itself natur
ally into three great departments. It
â¢will first be the province of The Call to
expose the men and the measures that
ruined the institution; to describe the
wild ventures into which the McDon
alds thrust themselves and were encour
aged by financial manipulators. When
hundreds of thousands of dollars of the
funds of the Pacific Bank had been
squandered and almost a million of dol
lars had flowed in a golden stream from
the People's Isank to give life to the de
cayed body of the Pacific, the wreck
ers turned in frantic endeavor in
every direction to prevent the crash
that was impending. Every effort
was in vain. All attempts to float
â worthless securities upon the financial
world were without purpose. Dis
honest companies were organized to
gull the public, but they were in vain,
and then to save themselves the con
spirators resorted to deliberate rob
bery that they might retain something
of their private fortunes out of the
ruin of the public's money. This re
markable correspondence which The
Call will publish will prove the dis
honesty of at least one public official,
the blackmail of a score of crkfty
schemers and the shameless dishonesty
of men who accepted a sacred trust to
abuse it.
In the long but intensely interesting'
recital the public will read the crimina
tion and recrimination of sharpers who
feared each other while seeking the
favor of the McDonalds. There will
be a story of wild and absurd am
bitions, petty love entanglements, gross
and persistent flattery and political
ambitions that were never to be real
ized.
The Call intends to show that the
conspiracy that ruined the Pacific
Bank and the People's Home Bank
was the most gigantic that was ever
plotted and carried to a successful con
clusion in the history of financial in
stitutions in this country. It will show
what never before to-day was made
public, proof that the McDonalds were
not the only wreckers of the two banks.
In the tremendous scheme to filch mil
lions of money from the public of San
Francisco The Call will prove that D.
8. D'orn, M. H. Sherman, A. F. Johns,
W. H. Eastland, O. T. Dyer and many
others were interested to the degree of
encouraging, inducing, cajoling and
threatening the McDonalds and their
bank on to financial ruin and personal
dishonor.
SHERMAN'S GIGANTIC SCHEME AND
ITS RESULTS. '
While the sons of Dr. McDonald had
Involved tl. great banks in crazy finan
cial schemes and wild ventures it was
not until m. H. Sherman became a di
rector of the Pacific Bank, in January.
1891, that the real conspiracy to ruin
began. From that moment M. H. Sher
man, speculator, manipulator and
schemer, led the McDonalds on until
the money of the Pacific Bank was dis
sipated and the funds of the People's
Home Savings Bank were stolen undftr
the thin guise of financial technicali
ties. Sherman concocted the scheme of
building an electric road in Los Ange
les. He had nothing but his wit to as-
Bist him and the credulity and foolish
financial notions of the McDonalds to
Bpur him on. Frank McDonald par
ticularly proved easy game. Sherman's
craft was equal to the task of flatter-

ing the young banker and the brilliant
idea of having the Pacific Bank organ
ize, build and control a great street
railroad in Los Angeles became a seri
ous fact. The Call intends to prove,
over the signature of M. H. Sherman
himself, that the McDonalds were in
veigled into giving up over $600,000 for
the building of that road. From that
moment the Pacific Bank had started
on its road to ruin. In this plot Sher
man had the absolute co-operation of
D. S. Dorn, who was the attorney for
the Pacific Bank and the People's Bank
and the confidential and bad adviser
of the McDonalds.
As soon ac Sherman had accom
plished his purpose to make the Pa

footing also In the People's Home Sav
ing Bank. This institution had been
established by the McDonald family
purely ap a feeder for the Pacific Bank.
The Call will prove by the secret cor
respondence of the conspirators that
the People's Bank was used simply for
purposes of deliberate robbery. The \
money that thirteen thousand poor de
positors placed in the vaults of the Peo- â¢
pie's Bank was carted away into the
Pacific Bank and 1 there dissipated by
the men who first flattered and cajoled
the McDonalds and then took them by
the throat.
Sherman had no sooner become a di
rector of the Pacific B^nk than he de
termined, as already indicated, to se
cure control in the People's Home Sav
ings Bank. Through his influence with
Dr. R. H. McDonald, exercised by wy-

cophancy and flattery, Sherman made J.
E. Farnum manager of the People's
Home Savings Bank. Farnum was
Sherman's cousin and a son-in-law of
Knight, who was at that time one of
the Bank Commissioners and an inti
mate friend of the Los Angeles
schemer. The Call will show in the
handwriting of M. H. Sherman hJmself
that this man with his electric road
scheme profesged to control absolutely
the official acts of this Bank Commis
sioner." Sherman dined at Knight's
house, and on more than one occasion
Farnum was expected to warn the
managers of both banks and prepare
them for the investigations of the Com
missioners. The Call will show that
M. H. Sherman for over two years and
a half played upon the credulity and
the dishonesty of the McDonalds, flood
ing them with his almost worthless
bonds, dragging from them the money
of the banks and seduced them into
new ventures that subsequently
brought disaster to the two institutions.
When this manipulator, who until
now has escaped criticism and expo
sure, found that he had won the con
fidence of financial dolts, he sprung
new schemes. The Call makes no as
sertion that is not based upon the very
signatures of the man himself. He or
ganized a phantom electric railway In
Phoenix and the McDonalds, in ex
change for the money of their deposi
tors, took the worthless bonds. One
of tho conspirators with almost exact
truth declared that the railroad had no
beginning and no end. Stimulated by
his tremendous success in flattering the
absurd managers and ownera of the Pa-

ciflc and People's banks. Sherman led
the McDonalds into another scheme,
the Phoenix Water Works. Dr. Mc-
Donald was tickled by the flatterer Into
accepting $142,000 in bonds of this con
cern and both his sons had to commit
a crime to relieve him of the debt. The
Call has in Its possession the records
to prove the origin, the development
and the conclusion of thfs affair even
to the crime of the three McDonalds,
father and sons.
But Sherman was not satisfied to hold
the favor of the McDonalds; he be
came their confidential agent. He was
at their beck and call, flattering, ca
joling and seducing into new chimeri
cal projects. His brain conceived &
rnagnilioent scheme of floating $5,000,
000 in bonds, while at the very same
moment he knew that the bonds al
ready out and in the vaults of the Pa
cific and People's banks were utterly
unavailable, and not worth one-fourth
their face value. But this brilliant t
dream of the Los Angeles manipulator i
cost the depositors of the two wretched
banks many more thousands of dollars,
and then Sherman saw that his flat
tery and his sycophancy had raised hire
from his knees and he could take the
McDonalds by the throat.
The banks were almost ruined. TtoO.
dull eyes of the McDonalds began tc
see. Disaster to their institutions wai
impending, and they placed on the"
shoulders of M. H. Sherman the re
sponsibility of the wreck that soon fol
lowed. This phase of the story which
The Call intends to publish will cer
tainly not be uninteresting to the many
thousands of people who will have the
proofs now that their money was carieJ
out of the back doors of the People's
Bank into the vaults of the Pacific,
and M. H. Sherman, J. E. Farnum and
their coconspirators then filched it into
their own coffers, leaving behind the
worthless records of chimerical pro
jects and valueless bonds of wild
schemes.
d. s. dorn's iron clutch upon
the McDonald banks.
But M. H. Sherman was not the only
favorite of the McDonalds. They had
many of them. One of them was D.
S. Dorn, the attorney of this city. Dorn
was the attorney for the Pacific and
the People's banks. He was a director
and an owner of stock in the Los An
geles Electric Railroad. He was one
of the moving: spirits of the John
Brown colony. He was interested in
the affairs of the Pacific Bank and the
Riverside Motor Railroad. He was
president of the Mohawk Canal and
Improvement Company. He was a di
rector and manipulator in the People's
Home Savings Bank. Wherever there
was a dollar controlled by the McDon
alds or a wild scheme suggested by
their diseased financial brain D. S.
Dorn was involved.
When Frank McDonald wished to
float some new chimerical scheme D. S.
Dorn drafted the r~->ers. When the
elder McDonald wished to place his
property beyond the reach of his credi
tors and to evade the consequences of
his own foolishness and the dishonesty
of himself and sons, D. S. Dorn pre
pared the legal documents. When the
egotistic brain of Richard McDonald
Jr. conceived the idea that its posses
sor should be Governor of California,
D. S. Dorn attempted to manipulate
the machinery of one of the great par
ties of this State. The Call makes
these assertions with a full under
standing of what they mean. This pa
per has the proof in its possession.
Throughout the long period of wild
speculation, disastrous investment and
culminating ruin, D. S. Dorn was the
confidential adviser and friend of the
McDonalds. He deluded them into thÂ«
belief that the School Department of
this city could be captured and that
upon the shoulders of the instructor*
In the public schools Dick McDonald
could leap Into the Governor's chair.
The conspiracy of the lawyer and the
flattered banker went so far as to make
nominees out of two of the other con
spirators who, in 1892, asked the suf
frages of the people of this city. Tha
Call will show that flattery was, vim-2
ply the vehicle through which D. S.
Dorn helped to fill his purse.
SECRET TRAGEDY OF DR. R. H. Me*
DONALD'S LIFE.
In this expose, which The Call feels
In duty bound to make, there Is nothing
sadder to record than the dishonor
which falls upon Dr. R. H. McDonald.
After the collapse of the Pacific Bank i
and the People's Home Savings Bank, j
I>r. McDonald, who had held an hon
ored position in this community, was
sincerely pitied even by the thousands
who had lost their hard-earned money
in the wreck of the banks. It was be
lieved that the old man had been duped |
by his dishonest sons, that the insti-i
tutlon of which he was president had.;
been led by knaves into dishonest
projects and that he, who had passed
70 years of age, was to bear the
odium of his sons' thievery. All of j
this was one of the gigantic delusions i
which the conspirators created. The 1
Tali feels it a duty to declare that Dr.
McDonald was as dishonest as his sons
and has now in his possession property
that belongs to the depositors of the
Pacific and the People's Home Savings
Hanks. The old man not only knew of
his sons' robbery, but was party to
it and in certain instances an instiga
tor of it. The Call will prove over his
own signature, the signatures of "his j
sons and the records of the Pacific j
Bank that hundreds of thousands of
dollars belonging to these banks was
stolen by R. H. McDonald Sr. This pa- .
per will prove that Dr. McDonald was
dishonest a year and a half before the .
Pacific Bank failed and fled from this'
city to evade the process of law. It
will show that one of his debts,
amounting to $142,000, was swept from
existence by the criminal touch of the '
pen commanded by R. H. McDonald Jr.: (
As the remarkabie story of deceit, de
ception, knavery and crime proceeds
The Call will show that Dr. McDonald
commanded from his sons, and through
them from the depositors of his banks,
more money for his daily needs. And
when the end was approaching the
old man, having deceived the Bank
Commissioners, and declined to keep
his solemn promise to pledge his pri
vate fortune, commanded his son Rich
ard to steal ten thousand dollars more
out of the wreck. In this dramatic
story The Call will produce for pub
lic consideration the records of the
crime. In the recital there will be an
element of the deepest pathos. The
elder McDonald had reached an age
when he felt that the shadow of death
was upon him. He counseled his sons
to cherish their early lessons of mor
ality and of religion and of the Chris
tian spirit of fairness to man. He
mned his children for what he
considered their base ingratitude to him
;nid he mourned over what he believed
to be the inevitable, closing dishonor to
an upright life.
He entered into a discussion deeply
in detail of his domestic affairs and of
those of his family. He warned his
son Richard against new love entangle
ments and reminded him that it had
cost $100,000 to get rid of one bad wo
man and to beware of another. With
a feeling of remarkable sincerity he
urged his sons to throw off the schem
ers v.ho were surrounding him and with
almost an avenging spirit he declared
that Sherman had ruined them and it
would break his heart to see the in
stitutions with which his name had
been so long connected go down in a
shameful wreck.
FRANK WAS CONFESSEDLY A PRINCE
OF THIEVES.
In this strange story of financial and
personal tragedy there Is no more |
prominent figure than that of Frank \
V. McDonald. The Call will prove to
| the public of San Francisco that Frank
I McDonald, by the authority of his own
I Ficnature, was one of the most princely j
thieves that ever preyed upon this !
L Ptate. Through the credulity of Frank
Â»M< Donald the Pacific Bank was in
tm -<1 into the disastrous Riverside
Rank affair. Through his lack of com-
Jmon sense and the flattering tongue of i
|>M. H. Sherman the Pacific Bank spent |
its -'normous sum of money In the Los I
Anpeles electric railway. The Phoenix ,
project, the Mohawk Canal and Im
provement affair, the Alaska Coal Com
pany, the Colton Marble Works and a j
dozen othor schemes were organized to j
take the money of business men /rom j
the Pacific Bank and the earnings of
working men from the People's Home
Savings Bank. One of the mort start
ling exposes that The Call will find Its
duty to make is Frank McDonald's gi
gantic plot to steal $600,000 deliberately
and almost without technical manipu
lation from the Pacific Bank.
The facts will prove that Frank Mc-
Donald, surrounded by his parasites
and flatterers, led the bank into losing
ventures and sank money in an effort to
become a thief. The story will not be
uninteresting and better than any other
phase r.f the terrible recital will prove
how the People's Home Savings Bank
was robbed. It will be shown that
Frank McDonald had the money in the
vaults of the People's Home bavings
Bank carried, almost as quickly as it
came in, to the vaults of the Pacific
Bank. J. E. Farnum will be exposed ;
as a willing agent In these transactions
and the fact will be demonstrated over
his own signature. Further than this'
and not satisfied with filching nearly
one million dollars from the People's
Bank Frank McDonald, at the frantic .
appeal of his brother, Richard McDon
ald Jr.. tried to steal more until both
saw the banks of the East at their
throats and their willing tool, W. H. H.
Hart, ex-Attorney General, no longer
able to help them. And then the doors !
of their thieves" den were closed. With '
cruel deliberation Frank McDonald j
schemed to seize the benefits cf his
father's property and to do so planned
what should be and what should not be
done in the event of his father's death.
The character of such speculation at
that time, six years ago, may be better
understood when it is known that the
elder McDonald is still alive and Frank
McDonald, a confessed thief, was a fu
gitive from justice at the time of his
death in London four months ago.
In his letters, which possess a terri
ble meaning, The Call will reveal one
of the elements of its proof that Wfl
liam H. H. Hart was dishonestly in
collusion with the thieving bankers.
DICK'S WILD AMBITIONS LED TO
THE BANK RUIN,
In ail the criminal Idiocy and syste
matic thievery that characterized the
wreck of the banks there is no more
picturesque figure than that of R. H,
McDonald Jr. This man was a pris
oner in the County Jail for over a year
after the destruction of the banks. He
was tried for several offenses alleged
to have been committed in connection
with the ruin of the institutions, but
the absolute proof of guilt was lack
ing and the man was acquitted. The
Call now has in its possession the ab
solute proof that R. H. McDonald Jr.
was not only an absurd financier and
a flatter^!, ambitious fool, but a thief.
He has recently come before public no
tice as a successful' applicant for ad
mission .to the bar. " Understanding top
fully the influence .exercised for evil by
lawyers in- the affairs of men, and j
' knowing what part attorneys - 'hived in |
! his downfall, he undoubtedly sought to
place himself on the right side of the
scale and. become a lawyer.
Early in 1891, while Frank McDonald
was planning: wild schemes for his
financial .undoing. Dick McDonald was
plotting to make "himself a greater fig
j.ure in finance than his brother and a
; more powerful influence in public af
fairs than any one else in the State.
Dick was 1 party and sympathizer in all
the schemes of Frank, but he had am
j bitions. of his own and sought to re
! alize the:m with the money that had
I been intrusted to the care of his father i
and the honor of his sons. To fully |
understand the criminal part that R.
H. McDonald played in the destruction
of the. two banks, the character of the
two Institutions and the relation exist
ing between them should be clearly un
derstood.
Both' banks were absolutely con
trolled-by the Mcbona 1 family. Dr.
'< McDonald held; 55 per cent in the Pa
i cific and; '65 -per cent in the People's.
The latteF .institution was organized by j
Dr. R. H! .McDonald simply for the pur- j
pose of making it a' feeder for the Pa- ;
cific Bank: "Every possible method of ]
advertisement was employed to bring â¢;
I money T to. the- People's Bank and The \
Call w.ili'.:prove that the McDonalds and j
the conspirators .'that surrounded them 1
ado'pteji ".two courses, by which they
could steal this money. One of these!
courses was :to. mate the Pacific Bank i
the. treasurer of the People's Bank and
to deposit as much money as the offi
cers dared take from the vaults of the
sayings institution. Hundreds of thou
sands of .dollars were thus carted away
from .the People's Bank into the vaults i
of the Pacific, but enormous as was ,
the sum it was by no means adequate j
to satisfy the rapacity of the mana- j
eers and their parasites.
The managers of the People's Bank
were necessarily tools In the hands
of the McDonalds. So clearly was this
understood that Dr. McDonald In one
of his letters declared that J. E. Far- 1
num had been employed as a servant i
and not as a dictator. Through the
servile obedience of the officers and
managers of the People's Bank every
worthless security and rotten indorse
ment that the Pacific Bank and its
agents cared to thrust upon the Peo
ple's Bank in exchange for gold was
accepted by the officers n r the savings
institution. The Call intends to pre
sent the proof of this startling fact and
even to show that a deliberate robbery
was committed in the acceptance of
checks that the management knew
were worthless.
When this condition of affairs is un
derstood it can readily be seen how
the wreck of the two banks was accom
plished. The letters of the conspira
tors demonstrate the fact that both
banks were made the victims of the
wld schemes of the McDonalds. Every
security that the Pacific Bank chose to
present the People's Bank was forced
to take. In this way the 13,000 deposi
tors of the People's Bank were doubly
robbed. The conspirators shamelessly
discussed how they might reduce the
enormous. Indebtedness of the Pacific
Bank to the People's Bank by thrust
ing upon the latter what were known
to be valueless bonds and stocks. In
August. 1891, eight months after M. H.
Sherman forced an entry into the Pa
cific Bank and J. E. Farnum was
tlii own into the People's Bank, the Pa
cific Bank was insolvent.
The criminal work of R. H. McDonald
Jr. then began in earnest. He was
wildly extravagant in a score of dif
ferent ways. To flatter hi? own vanity
and to gather around himself coteries
of sycophant men and women he In
augurated a variety of enterprises. The
Panorama was established and Dick
McDonald became the bogus hero of a
dozen women and as many men. The
Californian Illustrated Magazine was
aunched into the literary world and
Dick swelled on the cheap flattery of
its editors, canvassers and attaches.
The San Francisco Printing Company
was organized and Dick paid more
money for more adulation. . Anything
that would tickle his monumental
egotism became an object of his good
will. Thousands upon thousands of
dollars were squandered until it be
came inevitable that the banks must go
under. It was then that Dick McDon
ald began his fight against State
Prison. He employed all the parasites
around himâ D. S. Dorn of the legal
bureau; If! H. Sherman, of ready wit
and seductive tongue; W. H. Eastland,
the clown of the conspiracy; O. T.
Dyer, the Riverside manipulator; A. L.
Jenkins, cheapest of followers; Dr. W.
Jenning?on, crafty and far-seeing, and
A. F". Johns, shrewder perhaps than all.
Each of these men was employed to
spy upon the thers, to bear tales of
lying confidences and watchfulness, and
all of them to cheat the men by whom
they were employed. Thousands more
dollars were expended by ; R. H. Mc-
Donald jr. in sending these men at
cross purposes all over this State, to
the Eastern States, to London, Liver
pool and Paris to float stocks and bonds
that had no value which shreVd and
honest financiers cared to appreciate.
For over a year these men lived on the
credulity of th^ McDonalds and then
they thrived on their dishonesty. Tfce
story of the remarkable correspondence
of which R. H. McDonald Jr. .was the
fountain head will be published for the
first time by The Call and will reveal
the criminal conspiracy in which so
many men were involved. When the
time came R. H. McDonald Jr. did not
scruple to be dishonest. At his direc
tion the books of the Pacific Bank were
falsified and The Call has the proof.
At his command the People's Bank was
robbed and The Call has the man's
own dispatches to establish the fact.
"When the end was approaching Dick
McDonald begged one single further
chance to save himself from what he
believed to be .c inevitable conclusion
of his crimes. Even his judgment told
him that the officers of the law would
be upon him and in frantic command
he ordered his brother, Frank McDon
ald, to give him time enough to steal
the money with which to defend himself
If arrested. The Call will prove also
that with the cunning born of dishon
esty he bought the silence or at least
one newspaper of this city.
HART CRIMINALLY IN COLLUSION
WITH THE CONSPIRATORS.
The secret history of the wreck of the
Pacific Bank reveals no more startling
fact than the criminal part that W. H.
H. Hart, ex-Attorney General, played
in the affair. The Call will prove that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1898.
Hart bled the Pacific Bank until even
the McDonalds rebelled and refused to
allow him any more money because
they said he would never repay it. Over
the signature of Hart himself The Call
intends to show that long after the two
banks had been wrecked and the Bank
Commissioners time and again had
begged the Attorney General to perform
his duty and save thousands and thous
ands of poor people their hard-earned
savings, Hart refused to perform his
duty and was even then in consulta
tion with the McDonalds and thf> other
conspirators in an effort to devise some
new scheme by which the awful rob
bery of depositors might be made to
continue.
Even when the demand of the Bank
Commissioners upon the Attorney Gen
eral to perform his duty was made
Hart commanded his deputies to take
no action, while he assured the Mc-
Donalds that he would afford them am
ple time in which to remedy any dere
liction before he would act. The Call
intends to show in this vitally impor
tant correspondence that Hart gave his
assistance and advanced his suggestion
for the organization of the gigantic
scheme, one part of which was to rob
the Pacific Bank of $600,000. In this
gigantic conspiracy Hart promised to
place the Blythe estate at the command
of the McDonalds.
The official acts of W. H. H. Hart
will constitute one of the most dra
matic features of the entire story. In
New York, Los Angeles, Sacramento
and this city the man who was then
Attorney General of the State was in
intimate relationship with the McDon
alds and far more intimately ac
cjuainted with their dishonest schemes
than the Bank Commissioners ever
were. The Call makes these assertions
with the purpose and the power to
prove them.
A. F. JOHNS, THE CRAFTIEST OF Me-
DONALD'S SYCOPHANTS.
Of all the men that attached them
selves to the McDonalds and then ruled
them none was craftier, none cleverer,
none more consciencelessly deceiving
than A. F. Johns. Johns was the con
fidential agent of the Pacific Bank. He
was concerned primarily in the John
Brown colony and the Madera enter
prise, the two disastrous speculations
into which the Pacific Bank had been
drawn by W. F. Baird and John
Brown. Baird, it will be remembered,
had charge of the Madera Bank, and
Brown manipulated the colony that
bore his name. These men cajoled the
McDonalds Jr.to a support of their
1 scheme. Great sums of money were
expended fruitlessly, and day after day
the complications grew greater. Final
j ly the situation became apparent, and
j one day R. H. McDonald Jr. sent D. M.
| Tomblin to Madera to investigate.
i Tornblin was presumed to be a conserv
ative and accomplished banker. As he
I was about to begin his inquiry. Baird
' quietly informed him that the task
. would be labor lost. Baird frankly con
j fessing that the bank over which he
! had control was hopelessly ruined. In
! stead of drawing out of this disastrous
' speculation, the McDonalds plunged
deeper in, and A. F. Johns was given
his first opportunity to play his star
' engagement.
He was placed in charge of the John
â¢ Brown colony and before his steward
; ship ended the John Brown colony rep
: resented to the Pacific Bank a total
i loss of $300,000. The correspondence in
which John? figures conta-ins prob
j ably the most degrading of all the ful
' siime flattery and systematic deceit
I that was poured into the ears of Dick
McDonald. The letters of this manip
i ulator continue up to the time when
' he resigned from the service of the Mc
j Donalds and was stamped by them as
' a traitor and worse. His actions in
! connection with the John Brown colony
will prove a revelation to the deluded
| people who became colonists and were
j defratided of their rights. His corre
' spondenc", it is not unlikely, may serve
as a lever through which the colonists
â  may recover some of the property
wrested from them by conspirators.
A. F. Johns professed to look upon R.
H. McDonald Jr. as a financial and an
; intellectual pod. The explanation of
I this peculiar vision of the man rests in
! the fact that he had an interesting son,
| who is now a more or less successful
'< prizefighter. This son was made su
j perintendent of the John Brown colony
j and before his superintendency closed
1 both he and his father were accused of
! offenses that do not look well in print.
; Young Johns, D. S. Dorn and a young
I gentleman not unknown to fame as
! "Spider" Kelly were boon companions,
' and the record of their companionship
i at the John Brown colony, at Madera
| and Fresno constitutes a minor
; element of comedy to the main
i theme of tragedy that runs through
i the whole drama of the wreck â¢

DYER HELD THE BANKERS BY THE
THROAT TO THE END.
In the recital of the ruin of the Pa
cific Bank and Its feeder, the People's
Bank, one of the most prominent char
acters that appear is that of O. T. Dyer,
manager and the controlling spirit of
the Riverside Banking Company. At
one time Dyer owed the Pacific Bank
and the People's Bank 5400.000. Before
the end came this enormous sum was
reduced until it was $155,000. This rep
resented O. T. Dyer's part in the ruin
of the Pacific Bank. There was not
one man in the employ of the McDon
alds that did not systematically and
persistently condemn Dyer and pre
sent him in the shadiest of colors to the
McDonalds. Dyer said in Justification
of himself that he had been led into
wild schemes by Frank McDonald, who
thua became responsible for the ruin
of the Riverside Bank and the jeopardy
of the Pacific Bank. Dyer pretended,
however, that he had negotiable certifi
cates and he was pent East to dispose
of them as best he could.
In the correspondence that The Call
! intends to publish there are thousands
of references to O. T. Dyer and every
one of them la condemnation. O. T.
j Dyer, however, was proof against that
s<>rt of abuse. HÂ»> saw that the Mc-
Donalds and the hanks they controlled
were at. his mercy, and although agent
after agent wtia pent to Riverside to
watch his sister, Mjsr R. C. Dyer, and
epy after spy was hastened to New
; York to follow his movements, he knew
that the ruin of his bank meant dis
aster to the Pacific. Wher R. H. Mc-
Donald Jr., left in this city to brave the
financial storm and guard himself
against the penitentiary, was crying
out in ebject distress for money, O.- T,
Dyer kept increasing his terrible over'
drafts until Dick became almost
frantic. In the exuberance of rage M.
H. Sherman wrote that he would like
to kill Dyer. Dick said he would like
to torture the manager of the Riverside
Bank. The elder McDonald said that
Dyer was treacherous, unreliable and
dishonest. Frank declared that it was
a terrible day w-hen he met the gentle
man from Riverside. Dorn confined
his personalities to those remarks that
are usually considered unfit for publi
cation, and Tomblin, assigned to the
important duty of negotiating with
Miss Dyer, announced solemnly to Dick
McDonald that the lady really had the
worst disposition of any woman he had
ever met. The Dyers knew their posi
tion. They realized that the McDon
alds were utterly helpless and must
support the awful burden of the River
side Bank, as well as the crushing
weight of the Pacific, and so this trag
edy of finance continued to the end un
til collapse came to both institutions.
DICK'S SPIES FOUGHT FOR FAVOR
LIKE WOLVES.
Among a dozen men who enjoyed the
confidence of the McDonalds and used
it to advantage was, as already indi
cated, D. M. Tomblin. He also at
tempted to bring the Dyers to terms.
He worried Miss Dyer almost into hys
terics, but the lady never became hys
terical enough to lose her financial
i presence of mind and the overdrafts
continued with alarming regularity.
Tomblin's letters, which The Call will
publish, have a most significant bearing
I on the secret history of the McDonald
j banks. Tomblin, like all the rest, was
j a flatterer and a close, and keen ob-
I server of his competitors for the favors
\of Dick. Tomblin's revelations will
j give many startling facts to the public.
His caustic comments created in A. F.
Johns a thirst for blood and a very
emphatic determination at one stage of
the proceeding to plug Mr. Tomblin full
of holes. "While Tomblin criticized
Johns and Johns criticized Tomblin
both metaphorically tore the hide off
W. H. Eastland, and all confidentially
confided to the young financial Napo
leon of Pine and Sansome streets that
Dr. W. Jenningson - as no earthly good
to himself or anybody else. Jenning
son, with a franknees seldom to be
found, declared that as Dick's profes
sional spy he had discovered much to
make him fear the machinations of
Johns, Tomblin and Mitchell.
Two men in the history of the affair j
seem to have rendered honest reports to |
R. H. McDonald Jr. One of these was j
Colonel J. Woodard, otherwise known j
as "Jayhawker," the very mention of i
whose name had a tendency to throw !
Sherman into a fit. Two men gave their j
solemn word that they would send j
Woodard to a better world. One of i
these men was Johns and the other i
Frank McDonald. Woodarct, however, |
prepared a document that shows be- :
yond any question the criminal con- |
spiracy through which the Los Angeles j
electric railway was created, developed ;
and maintained. But with the blind
ness that inevitably attaches itself to |
idiocy R. H. McDonald Jr. failed to
heed the warning although he was
solemnly counseled unless he divorced
himself from M. H. Sherman and more
honestly protected, the sacred trust that j
over thirteen thousand people of this
city confided to his care his bank would
end where Ralston closed the Califor
nia Bank. This prophecy was made
nearly two years before the Pacific
Bank failed anÂ«J it wan made by Colenfrl
Woodard, the ex-newspaper man, law- j
yer and Sherman's implacable Nem
esis. The other honest criticism of the
schemes of Sherman and of the Dyers
and of Johns was given by George
Mitchell, who received for his pains the
ill will of the foolish banker and the
undying hatred of his parasites.
There are a few men that will lose
more through the expose of the secret
correspondence of the Pacific Bank
than Professor C. F. Holder, who was
made editor of the Californian Illus
trated Magazine. At the time of the
wreck of the banks Professor Holder
escaped unscathed. Thousands of men
believed him to be upright, conscien
tious and just; and at that time there
! was nothing to justify a contrary opin
! ion, although Professor Holder knew
! that while his praises were being
I sounded and he was looked upon as an
inexperienced dupe of the McDonalds,
i his own letters removing this mask were
in the Pacific Bank. No one at the timt
of the crash could understand why it
was or how that Professor Holder had
! given his unsecured note for $135,000.
j The professor's letter will show that the
! editor was not as inexperienced as he
I posed. He was engaged in more than
editorial duty with Dick McDonald and
became the young banker's go between
on many a mission that had nothing
to do with the Californian Magazine.
In the secret correspondence The Call
I will prove to the public that Professor
j Holder played a dubious double part.
THE PART PLAYED BY WOtiEN IN
LEADING DICK TO RUIN.
Not the least interesting part of the
secret correspondence is on perfumed
and dainty paper and in the charac
teristic handwriting of women. These
ladles, with a fearlessness that few men
command, carried their reputations on
the points of their pens. There is more
than one epistle in this correspondence
from women high in the esteem of the
community, women enjoying the con
fidence of thousands as educators of
little children in the public schools of
San Francisco. But there are plots
and schemes and counter plots and
counter schemes in the School Depart
ment pf this city and the letters of at
least one of these women will show
how directors are made and unmade in
the offices of thieving bankers and com
placent attorneys.
These interesting epistles will show
how It sometimes happens that school
directors are the creatures of school j
teachers, and not always the contrary, ;
as is generally supposed. The corre- j
spondence in this phase, it would seem, i
would be incomplete if the rather i
coarse love affairs of R. H. McDonald
Jr. were not exploited, and more than
one woman who sent her perfumed
notes to the Pacific Bank thinks now j
perhaps that there was some Ink that j
might better never have been spilled.
And this terrible correspondence re
flecting all, perhaps, of the worst mo
tives and most dubious actions that
carry men forward in their luat for
money The Call has In its possession
and will publish with a purpose that
some of the stolen thousands belong*
ing to the people of this city may be
recovered and the men who conspired
to rob the poor people who intrusted to
their honor may be punished as they
deserve for their crimes.

OPENS WELL
I N ALAMEDA
State Ticket Will Be
Well Supported.
BENEFITS OF DISSENSION
LEGISLATIVE TICKET IS PER
FECTLY SAFE.
Some of the County Officers Have a
Hard Fight, but Their
Prospects Are Very-
Bright.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 31.
The last week of the campaign in Ala
meda County opens most auspiciously for
the Republican ticket. There are so many
evidences of factionalism among all the
parties or ex-parties that it now looks as
though the Republican nominees will reap
the full benefit of such dissension.
The Democrats are hopelessly rent
asunder. The Fitzgerald wing, which was
proved at the convention to be in the mi
nority, will vote the fusion ticket, while
the opposition, which is much larger in
number and which includes many of the
most prominent of Democrats, will vote
as it pleases, which practically means
that they will not make their fingers ache
placing red crosses opposite fusion nomi
nees.
A comparison of the ordinary vote in :
years other than Presidential shows t~at j
a fair Republican majority for this county |
next week would be about 2750 votes, and i
this number, it is believedâ and possibly
more, will be returned. This is not a Ma
guire Democratic county, and never was.
The Populist party has disappeared. It j
Is true that a certain section interested in
fusion ' held the convention and were
patted on the back by the Democrats and |
given two or three of the nominations, to
prevent them putting up a ticket of their
own. Since this little farce was enacted
there has been so much repudiation of the
actions of the f Unionists that out very
little of the Populist-fuslonlsts are in cvi- I
dence. The middle-of-the road men will
almost to a man vote the Republican i
State ticket. Many of them have openly
announced their intention of voting for |
Gage, and the sanctum of Editor Bretz
is full of communications from all parts
of the State, showing that this sentiment
is very general.
The Sliver Republicans have headquar
ters in the Blake & Molfitt building. There |
is a sign on the door, but no one is in ;
charge, and the name has no significance I
whatever in politics In this county, It :
certainly cannot control fifty votes. It is
true that at the fusion convention they I
were accorded the privilege of making one \
nomination, and, to the surprise of their
alleged political confederates, they sim
ply indorsed the popular and safe candi
date. Henry P. Dal ton, who Is a pro
" The Cc in dependent movement, being com- j
posed almost exclusively of Republicans, ;
will vote the State ticket nearly straight,
and If the usual vote be cast in this
county there should be no difficulty about
giving Mr. Gage his expected majority.
The Republican county ticket will of ne- I
cessity reap a large share of the benefits j
that will accrue to the State ticket from j
the dissensions already mentioned. The
Democratic vote being divided ana the
Independent ticket being largely com
posed of candidates who -will draw 'from
the same elements of the voters as the
fusion ticket makes the chances for the
Republican ticket much greater. A. X.
Grim and A. T. Macdonough will split the
opposition against Charles Spear T tor . Re "
corder Louis Schaffer and 1. C. Landre
gan will greatly improve the chances of
Oscar Rogers for Sheriff. Judge Allen
will have no difficulty in being elected
District Attorney. T. C. Stoddard has not
gained any strength since his nomination,
and Frank Jordan should not have much
difficulty in being re-elected County
Clerk. Everybody knows who the next i
Assessor will be. Cal Ewing Is looked i
upon as a sure winner for Auditor, and |
there is nothing that can prevent honest
John Talcott From being re-e ected Su
pervisor. John R. Glascock is making
a â  lively campaign against Supervisor
Church, but the Republicans in the lat
ter's- district are confident that their man
will win. The balance of the Republican
ticket- may be. considered as safe. â¢
The' legislative candidates in this Re
publican county will not have much to
fear. In all the Assembly districts, ex
cept the Forty-ninth, the Republican
nominee will win. In the Forty-ninth W.
J Schmidt, a Berkeley contractor and a
politician of original ideas, is making an
independent Republican campaign against
the regular nominee. A. A. McKeen.
Schmidt will get a bunch of votes, but they
will be drawn as much from one party as
another, and as this district is always j
close, McKeen,' while he may win, has j
less of a sure thing than any other As
sembly nominee. /
'Hon. Frank W. Leavitt will certainly
occupy ex-Senator Denison's seat in the
next Legislature. He has made a winning
campaign from the- start, and with him
it is only a question of -the size .of his
majority. City Attorney E. K. Taylor of
Ala'meda, also Republican candidate for ,
Senator, has really no opposition. His
opponent, Colonel J. Tobin of Alameda,
thought so little of the nomination when
first offered him that he declined it. It
was left open for some time, no Democrat
apparently being willing to be slaugh
tered, and finally Coldnel Tobin r was in
duced to go on the. ticket.

MAGUIRE TALKS
TO VOTERS IN
NINE HALLS
Tries to Save Craig in
the Fifth.
THE JUDGE A WARLIKE EAGLE
"BLOOD ON HIS TALONS AND
FIRE IN HIS EYE."
â 
He Thinks There Are No Honest Men
but Democrats, and a Dire Curse
Will Follow Repuolican.
Victory.
That there is a condition of cold extrem
ities in the Demoeratic-Popoeratic Cen
tral Committee is evidenced by the fact {
that Judge Maguire, the Little Giant of ;
the tireless jaw, was required by those j
managers to deliver nine speeches last j
night in the southwestern part of the â¢
city which Is embraced in the Fifth Con- |
gressional District.
The tour was to some extent organized
to boost the candidacy of William Crais
against Eugene F. Loud for Congress. It i
was furthermore a monotonous series of j
occasions in which the people were treat- j
ed to the music of the beating of anti- j
railroad tomtoms, and informed that the
only salvation for California lay in the j
election of Maguire and a straight Demo- i
cratic ticket. If this were not done tne .
wreck and ruin of this commonwealth was t
assured.
To those who heard Mr. Maguire in his
several speeches he was quite amusing. ;
He invariably called the attention of his :
hearers to the fact that they elected him |
to the Assembly twenty-three years ago, :
he had been in some office ever since and
deserved now to be promoted to the high
office to which he had been nominated. \
At each hall Mr. Maguire expressed re- ]
gret that he could "not discuss the issues
of the campaign" and then proceeded to |
tell his hearers that there is nothing in i
this campaign except the Southern Pa- ;
cine and James G. Maguire; that every
Republican who is taking an active inter- J
est in the suicc-fs of his party is a hired |
tool of the railroad. Somehow the gen- i
tleman did not win much applause on this
score, nor when he referred to what he !
had done to the great and bad corpora
tton while in Congress. Every gathering '
was solemnly promised that if elected hv?
would endeavor to conduct his office In
the Fame manner as he had done pre- ,
viously and officially.
Without any known cause or provoca- ,
tion Mr. Craig referred to the "Little >
Giant" as "the Democratic eagle, with
blood on his talons and fire in his eye."
Whose particular gore Mr. Maguire was
exhibiting on his ta!ons was not stated
by Mr. Craig, but he told nine different
audiences about the proposition.
During Mr. Maguire's long and hard
night's work he found occasion to men- â 
tion the fact that James H. Barry was
running for Congress in the Fourth Dis- :
trict, and suggested that the Democrats ;
vote for him. Julius Kahn, Mr. Barry's
opponent, was not mentioned. Mr. Ma- \
quire assured the public that the election
of the Republicans means an administra
tion "of the people, for the monopoly and
by the monopoly." The only way, there
fore, to avoid disaster was to elect Ma
guire, Hinton and Dunn. The single tax
question was coldly ignored, but â¢ the !
Judge found it expedient to tell how â 
-ordially he despised the poll tax and
HOW thoroughly he wpuid abrogate the
same If he worn only Governor. fte alsn
told how he admifceel the public schools
and what a bad man Mr. Gage was for.)
saying that the abolition of the poll taxi
was a blow at the public school system..
The Judge begged the people to get out
and defeat Congressman Loud and "re
deem the district." He said that Loud's i
first election was an accident and both '
his subsequent successes mistakes due to :
the acts of Democrats. The future of the I
district depended upon the election of j
Craig.
Mr. Maguire had poorly attended meet
ings in the sections nearest the center of
the city, but in the other districts the at
tendance was good and his reception cor- ;
dial. He begun his evening campaign at
Sixth and Market streets and spoke in
nearly every hall between that point and
the Almshouse.
There was a howl from the boys who ;
arranged the Manhattan Holl meeting, j
They were wholly ignored and were com- I
pelled to content themselves with beer \
and cheese instead of Maguire and
Craig. ' . '
The hot time closed at Eintracht Hall, i
Twelfth and Folsom streets, at midnight. ;
HAWAII'S CHINESE.
They Will Not Be Allowed to Come
to the United States as
Laborers.
Joshua K. Brown, one of the Chinese In
spectors detailed from Washington for
duty on this coast, has received orders to
proceed to Hawaii and take charge of
Chinese immigration there. The exclu
sion laws of the United States are now in
force In the inlands, and the Chinese resi
dents of Hawaii are not entitled to visit
the United States. They must come in,
if .it all, under the same restrictions as
are imposed upon Chinese from China.
Another inspector will be sent hither to
take the place designed for Mr. Brown.
The Becker-Cre -an Case.
The evidence for the prosecution In the
Becker-Creegan case is slowly being
placed before the Jury. The morning ses
sion was taken up in hearing testimony of
witnesses who knew of Becker's presence
In Oakland at the time of the commis
sion of the crime. McCJosky, an alleged
confederate, was on the stand in the
afternoon, but his testimony incriminated
Deane to a greater extent than it did the
defendants. When the witness left the
stand the case went over until this morn
ing.
Husband Against Wife.
Lawrence McMahon has sued his wife,
Anna McMahon, to recover possession of
property on Tennessee and Solano streets.
The plaintiff alleges that while he was ill
and mentally unbalanced the defendant
caused him to convey, the property to her.
She now refuses, notwithstanding the fact
that plaintiff has recovered, to reconvey
the property, and holds it for her own use,
to the exclusion of the plaintiff. Hence
the suit.

to marry him, promised Judge Conlan
yesterday that he would never seek to

BOLD AND SUCCESSFUL
ROBBERY AT SPOKANE
Masked Men Loot the Safe in the

Freight Office.
SPOKANE, Oct. 31.â One of the bold
est and most successful robberies In
the history of this city took place at
6:36 o'clock this evening, when two.
masked men held up the occupants of
the Union Depot Company's freight of
fice on "Washington street. The rob
bers obtained between $500 and $700
from the safe and the cashier's money
drawer and /made their escape.
Four men were in the freight office
working when two masked men entered
by a rear door.
They lined the four occupants of the
office up in one corner with their hands
in the air. While one of the robbers
covered the four with his revolver the
other proceeded to the money drawer,
which he had already compelled Cashier
H. M. Reed to open, and poured its
contents into his â  coat pocket. He
made a similar disposition of the
money in the safe, which had stood
open when the robbers entered. After
securing- the money the two robbers
backed to the door and disappeared in
the darkness.

HISTORY - MAKING MESSAGE
COMMUNICATED TO THE DONS
AT THE PARIS CONFERENCE.
America Will Only Assume Such Por
tion of the Debt as Has Been
Spent for the Benefit of
the Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 31.â The American Peace
Commissioners, each carrying a port
folio containing records and personal
memoranda, left their headquarters in
the Continental Hotel for the meeting
("with the Spanish Commissioners at the
Foreign Office shortly before 2 o'clock
this afternoon. The president of the
Spanish Commission, Senor Montero
Rios, whose health at one time was
bo precarious as to threaten an indefi
nite adjournment of the sessions of the
commissions, had improved to the ex
tent of enabling him to attend to-day's
meeting. He arrived at the Foreign
Office in a closed carriage with his col
leagues shortly after the Americans
reached the meeting place. Soon after
2 o'clock the commissioners confronted
each other across the table on which,
in 1778, Benjamin Franklin and his col
leagues signed the treaty of independ
ence of the United States.
The Americans were removing their
â wraps when the Spaniards entered the
anteroom, and polite and cordial greet
ings were exchanged as the two groups,
commingling, passed through the grand
galon, where a buffet was spread, and
entered the conference chamber, in
which, before leaving, the Spaniards
would learn the attitude of the United
States toward the Philippines.
The Spanish Commissioners took their
accustomed places at the historic table,
the afternoon light full in their faces,
while the Americans ranged themselves
opposite, with their backs to the light,
and with the interpreter standing at the
end of the table, on the right of Judge
Day and the left of Senor Montero
Kios, and between the two secretaries,
Mr. Moore and Senor Ojeda.
Secretary Moore, upon the request of
Judge Day, passed to Mr. Ferguson, the
interpreter, the formulated demands of
the United States regarding the Philip
pines, which were read to the Spaniards
In their own tongue by a. rapid render
ing from the English, in which they
were written. Although the Spanish
Commissioners did not betray anxiety
their attention to the reading was keen.
They had anticipated that the United
States would take over the islands, but
the terms and details of the transfer
had all along been a subject of specula
tion.
The reading disclosed the fact that j
the United States Oovernmen: had de
termined to possess for itself certain
territory and parts of land bounded by
and lying within such parallels of lat
itude and longitude as mark the limits
of the Philippine archipelago. The
XJt: ted States do not propose assuming
the Philippine debt of $40,000,000, but
they are willing to be responsible to
Spain for a sum of money equal to the
actual expenditures by Spain in the
Philippines for the advantage of the
islands and for the good of their peo
ple, for permanent betterments and for
improvements, both physical and men
tal.
The reading of the presentment spe
cifies that the United States will reim
burse Spain to the extent of her "pa
cific expenditures" made in the archi
pelago. This phrase "pacific expedi
tures" is employed to differentiate the
expenditures by Spain in combating
insurrections in the Philippines.
The one is felt by the Commissioners
to be a fair burden on the acquiring
power, while the other and latter class
01 expenditures is held to have been log
ically assumed by Spain in the inevit
able hazard to a nation resorting to
arms to enforce order in its own terri
tory.
Such is the vital portion of the pre
sentment made by the American Com
missioners to-day, and it is to be ob
served that while the main proposition
as to possession and financial responsi
bility is clear and definite, many details
have been left to the developments of
the discussions between the two com
missions. Thus, while the Spaniards
are to-night quite certain that the
United States intends to reimburse!
them for "pacific expenditures," they
remark that they are not enlightened
as to whether the Americans expect to
indorse the Spanish obligations to the
extent of "pacific expenditures" in the
archipelago or whether they will hand
Spain a lump sum of gold large enough
to cover Spanish outlay so designated.
Possibly the American Commissioners
themselves are not at this moment
fully determined on this point. It is
â unlikely, however, that the Americans
will care to become identified in the
slightest degree with Spain in her re
sponsibility to her creditors. The
clearer method seems to be to hand
to Spain f-pot cash, or something as
good, and to bid her apply it on her
debts 1 y whatever name known, or to
put it in her wallet for whatever use
she may elect.
While he United States have desig
nated "pacific expenditures" as those
they will reimburse to Spain, the pre
sentment of the American Commis
sioners to-day did not demand either a
schedule or an inventory of the same
from the Spaniards. But the sugges
tion naturally raises an inquiry as to
the kind and quantity of Spain's "pa
cific expenditures" in the Philippines,
and some light may be given on that
matter now.
There is considerable traffic between
the islands and some time ago a sys
tfm of lighthouses horame necessary.
Fpain set out to supply this and pro-
Wted forty-eight light stations. Of
these Fhe has already constructed sev
fntcf-n of the first class and sixteen of
the second class. What they cost is not
yet known here, but in American wa
ters those of the first class cost from
*2F,.00n to $250,000 each, so that, on an
average basis of the minimum cost in
the T-nitorl States, Spain's thirty-three
lighthouses may represent an outlay of
$825,000.
Spain has constructed breakwaters
at Manila at an expense not yet known
here, and wharves of small value along
the Paslg Rivpr. She has recently
built barracks for 24.000 men now occu
pied by American troops, the cost of
which is not yet ascertained.
At Cavite Spain had built a naval
station, which, before it was sacked hv
the natives, was said to he equal to the
Mare Island station and may be worth
52.R00.000. Whether or not the last two
items can be strictly designated "pa
cific expenditures" must be determined
in conference, but the lighthouse, water
Improvements, barracks and naval sta

Great Divide separating the Nile and Congo basins, beyond which the Brit
ish insist the French shall not come, with the several places held by
Egyptian garrisons at the time of the Mahdi uprising.
The Bahr-el-Ghazal country has an area five times as large as England
and a population of from five to seven millions, most of whom are cattle
owning and iron working negroes. The region passed under the control of
Egypt in 1878, when Gessi Pashi, Gordon's able lieutenant, defeated Zuhbier
Pasha, the great slave dealer, at his stronghold, Dun Sulieman, which
was made the seat of government until the surrender to the Mahdi in 1884,
since which time no Europeans or Egyptians have been in the country un
til Major Marchand's advent.

! deemed worth a fair price. Spain has
I also built some schoolhouses, which the
Americans are willing to take over at
cost.
The Spanish Commissioners listened
attentively, though not without some
evidences of impatience and surprise at
the financial suggestions in the Ameri
can presentment, and finally asked
until Friday to consult the Madrid
Government and make reply.
Adjournment was then taken to that
day.
After the conference was dissolved
the Spanish Commissioners expressed
the opinion that the American demands
would oreate in Spain, as they had
upon her Commissioners, an exceeding
ly grave impression.
"Were the Spanish Commissioners
pushed to final determination to-night
they would reject the American de
mands, but the changing tone of the
Spanish press recently urges the con
summation of a treaty of peace, how
ever rigorous, the argument being that,
although the Spaniards bow to the
American demands, the Commissioners
do not acknowledge the justice or ad
mit the legality of them.
To-night the Snanish Commissioners
feel that the United States to all in
tents and purposes have not offered
any financial inducement to Spain to
cede by treaty any part of the Philip
pines. Had the American Commission
ers even offered to take over the entire
Philippine debt of about $40,000,000 the
Spaniards affect to feel that it would
have been as nothing and they regard
to-day's position so meager as not to
warrant even a schedule of Spain's
"pacific expenditures" in the archipel
ago.
DELAY WILL BE VERY
? DEAR FOR SPAIN
NEW YORK, Oct. 31.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
President McKinley's supplemental in
structions to the American Peace Com
missioners on the subject of* the Phil
ippines leave open the matter of com
pensation to be given Spain, and are
only explicit in directing them to in
form the Spanish Commissioners that it
is the purpose of the United States to
retain possession of all the islands.
The Spanish Commissioners have
been given to understand that the
United States will consider the subject
of compensation, but no instructions
whatever regarding this have been sent
to Paris. The amount and character
of the compensation are left open for
negotiation between representatives of
the two nations.
It is confidently believed here that
the Spanish Commissioners will ulti
mately agree to give uÂ»* the islands,
though they may prolong negotiations
considerably before yielding. Should
they refuse to entertain the proposition
and break off negotiations the two
countries would be brought to the verge
of a resumption of hostilities. Spain
now has an opportunity to plve up the
Philippines and receive some compen
sation for them. Should her Govern
ment, however, compel the United
States to resume hostilities or go to the
extent of preparing for such resump
tion she would forfeit all rights to com
pensation, and would not only be
stripped of the Philippines, but mighi
lose still more of her island possessions.
President McKinley regards the Phil
ippines as conquered territory, which
the United States has a right to dispose
of under the laws of war.
UNCLE SAM BACKED
BY GREAT BRITAIN
WASHINGTON, Oct. 31.â The Paris
dispatch stating it to be the purpose
of the commissioners on the part of
America to insist upon the retention of
the entire Philippine archipelago and
that this purpose had been stated In
writing created no surprise here, for on
Sunday night the President sent to
Chairman Davis of the commission a
cipher cablegram instructing the com
missioners to make a firm stand on this
line. This, as intimated by the Eastern
newspapers of Democratic faith, is not
intended as a mere piece of "bun
combe," Intended to influence voters at
the forthcoming election, for those who
have been nearest the President have
known tor months that it was in his
mind to retain the whole Philippine
group. Indeed, it has been his intention
to acquire the islands ever since the
naval battle of Manila. The annexation
of the Hawaiian Islands was but a part
of the policy he outlined for his ad
ministration soon after his inaugura
tion. A close friend of the President
related to The Call correspondent a
conversation had at the White House
when the Dlngley tariff bill was pend
ing. Allusion was made to the old
"McKlnlay bill" passed in 1890, and to
James G. Elaine's emphatic denuncia
tion of that measure, when one night
ha appeared before the Ways and

NEW YORK. Oct. 31.â The
Herald's Washington corre
spondent says: Some hitch has
been encountered in connection
with the movement of troops to
Southern camps. I am inform
ed that the railroads have band
ed together for a new deal with
the Government. Since points
of destination have been defi
nitely established pooling ar
rangements, I am told, have sud
denly taken shape which puts
the Government at the mercy
of the transportation companies.
In order to effect some rate that
is reasonable the Government has
invited railroad representatives
to a conference to-morrow,
when the whole subject will be
canvassed.
Means Committee at the Capitol and
dramatically declared it was a measure
that would impose a burdensome taxa
tion on the people which they would
resent at the polls, while the bill would
not open the doors of foreign markets
for the sale of "a single barrel of pork."
During an interview with Presiden
McKinley at the White House recentl
Mr. Blame's prophecy was alluded t
and the President remarked: "Not
withstanding the direful prediction o
Mr. Blame, who was carried off his fee
by an excess of passion, the time i
near at hand when the United State
will find a market for her product
abroad, not only in South America anc
European countries, but in the Orient.
Dewey's success at Manila open'ec
the way for the realization of Presi
dent McKinley's long cherished plan of
extending our trade in the far East.
There are indications, too, that acting
hand in hand with Great Britain he
will seek to extend our commeice even
beyond the Chinese walls. The recall
of Embassador John Hay from the
Court of St. James and^iis appointment
as Secretary of State was a part of this
plan, for while Mr. Hay was in London
he acted under instructions from Wash
ington and through conferences with
Lord Salisbury and Mr. Chamberlain
reached an agreement wJiereby the two
great English-speaking countries were
to join hands in the far East in order
to compete with Germany for the trade
of the Orient which she is so rapidly
acquiring, as well as to resist the ag
gression of Russia in the Chinese em-
This compact is what gave rise to ru
mors of an "alliance" between the two
na'. ; ons at that time. But this is as
fa: he so-called alliance went. The
Unite J States did not bind itself to aid
Great Britain with armed force to re
sist Russian aggression in Manchuria,
but It was understood even then we
would retain the Philippines and this
was and is greatly desired by Great
Britain.
This information was given The Ca
correspondent by one who has been ii
rlose touch with the President an
there is no reason to doubt its correct
ness.
When two or three weeks ago it wa
decided to strengthen our garrison 1

by the President to make a firm stanc

AMERICA'S DEMAND
SURPRISES THE DONS
MADRID, Oct. 31.â The news that the
Spanish Peace Commissioners at Paris
had referred to the Government the for
mal demand of the American Commis
sioners for the absolute cession of the
entire Philippine group caused the
greatest surprise in Madrid. The
strongest feeling prevails that the Gov
ernment should protest energetically
against what is regarded as a violation
of the spirit of the protocol.

SAVANNAH, Ga., Oct. 31.â 1t is official

AN EMERGENCY SQUADRON
GATHERING AT DEVONPORT
WITH ALL SPEED.
France May Yield All Except as to
the Question of Her Right to
the Bfl.hr-eI-Gh.a2al
District.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
LONDON, Oct. 31.â There was an un
! expectedly gloomy feeling this morn
i ing on the Stock Exchange and the
! Paris Bourse, both of these markets
j being influenced, it is inferred, by the
aggressive tone of some of the French
i papers. Besides this, something extra
! ordinary seems to have happened, and
it looks as if a crisis were approach
ing. The British naval preparations
are being pushed with great activity.
The British emergency squadron Is
gathering at Devonport with all pos
sible speed. Seven battleships and one
cruiser have thus far been designated
to join the squadron-
Officers and sailors have been hur
riedly recalled from leave of absence,
several battleships and cruisers at
Portsmouth are taking their 1 full crews
on board and other warlike prepara
tions are being made. A number of
signalmen, now on duty with the Brit
ish Channel Squadron, which arrived at
Gibraltar this morning, have been or
dered home for service, it is presumed,
on British auxiliary cruisers, if the lat
ter should be desired for active ser
vice.
A sensation has been caused by the
arrest of a supposed Russian spy at a
fort near Harwich. The man was al
ready under surveillance and went to a
redoubt where he tried to obtain some
information from a sentry regarding
the fortifications. He was promptly
arrested and inquiries are being made
regarding his antecedents.
It is also asserted to-day that the
commanding officers of the London vol
unteer regiments had received orders
to prepare for immediate mobilization,
and it was asserted that the different
artillery corps have been Informed as
to the forts on the southern and east
ern coasts to which they have been al
lotted.
The Pall Mall Gazette this afternoon
says: "England has been and even now
is so near war that the Government has
carried its preparations to the farthest
limit of the preparatory stage. It has
been arranged to call out the reserves
and militia, to mobilize the volunteers
simultaneously, and to form large
camps at various important railroad
junctions, where rolling stock and lo
comotives will be concentrated."
FRANCE CLINGS TO THE
BAHR-EL-GHAZAL DISTRICT
PARIS, Oct. 31.â The Eclair* to-day
says it learns on reliable authority that
the Fashoda question will be settled fa
vorably to Great Britain by the recall
of Major Marchand. France, the pa
per adds, yields all, reserving only the
question of the right of the Bahr-el-
Ghazal district, which she does not
consider as belonging to Egypt.
Continuing, the Eclaire remarks: "M.
del Casse, however, has now decided to
raise the whole Egyptian question,
which should have been done from the
first, and thus to avoid the humiliation
of yielding to the British ultimatum.
When the question is thus enlarged
France will not be alone in its discus
sion with the Marquis of Salisbury.
Egypt interests all the powers. Rus
sia has promised M. del Casse its most
effective assistance and Germany has
the greatest interests, in view of her
African possessions and trade in the far
East, that the Suez canal should not
be too exclusively British, and is dis
posed to support French-Russian argu
ments for a definite settlement of the
Egyptian question."
ENGLAND MAY WANT
THREE PACIFIC LINERS
VANCOUVER, Oct. 31.â An uncon
firmed report says the Canadian Pacific
Railroad has received notification from
the British Admiralty that three big
Empress liners may be required at any
moment to be transformed into auxil
iary cruisers. Guns and other equip
ments lie at Hongkong and Esquimalt.
One- vessel is now in Vancouver harbor,
one at Hongkong and the other en route
to Yokohama, If trouble with France
assumes its worst aspect the Empresses
will be ready immediately.
BRITISH ACTIVITY
AT HALIFAX YARDS
HALIFAX, N. S., Oct. 31.â Every
available shipwright in this city has
been engaged by the naval authorities
here, and orders have been given to
prepare battle ships and other vessels
for sea as soon as possible. Saturday
the men worked all day, something un
precedented in the dock yard here.
The great activity displayed is the
result of messages from the home au
thorities.
The battle ship P^nown, cruisers Pel
ican and Cordelia, gunboat Columbine
and two torpedo-boats are now here
and are being fitted out as ouickly as
possible. So far they have not been
ordered away, but instructions are
hourly expected.
EGYPTIAN BATTALION

LONDON, Nov. I.â The Daily Mail

The Daily Mail confirms the reports
of unexampled activity at the French
dock yards, notably at Toulon, where
the coast forts have been experimenting
with melinite shells against an old gun
boat.
MOBILIZATION OF
DEFENSE FORCES
LONEJON, Nov. I.â Most of the papers
here are full of alleged war prepara
tions, despite the undoubted fact that
the authorities are doing their best to
discourage publication and are even
denying statements that have already
appeared.
Yesterday (Monday) a sudden order
was received at Dover for an experi
mental mobilization of the defense
forces. All the heights and forts were
smartly occupied in a manner giving
full satisfaction.
The arsenal at Woolwich is working
until 11 o'clock every night, the Gov
ernment having given large orders for
guns, searchlights and other naval
equipment. The British Channel squad
ron has cast anchor off Gibraltar.
The advice from Paris in the special
dispatches this morning add little to
what was already known regarding the
situation at Fashoda. It is believed
that Captain Baratier is taking only
verbal instructions for Major Mar
chand.
The idea prevails at the French capi
tal that Count Muravieff, the Russian
Foreign Minister, while there on his
recent visit, promised Russian support

HALIFAX, N. S., Oct. 31.â The naval
train wrecked near Hat Portaee on the
Canadian Pacific Railway left Halifax
Thursday night on the arrival of the
steamer Carthaginian, from Liverpool,
with drafts for the British squadron.
The train consisted of six colonist cars
and baggage cars and carried 133 sail
ors and eleven officers. Two sailors
had suffered so severely from seasick
ness they remained over at Halifax in
the military hospital. The train was
made up under Imperial Government
officers' inspection and was being

Tompkinsville, making an exceptionally
smooth and rapid run down. The coiner
Barenda, now at Bahla, consumed thirty
one days in making the same trip. Be
cause o"f her lack of speed, she will prob
ably be allowed to return to the United

as was intended.
The battle-ships will stop at Bahia for
a few days, replenishing their coal bunk

CHARLESTON W. Va., Oct. 31.â A
serious clash between Federal and State
judicial authorities is expected here.
Manard Stiles, attorney for Henry C.
King of New York, obtained from the
United States Circuit Court here an in
junction to ...nibit the Sheriff of Logan
County from selling land of his client
for taxes. Judge Doolittle of the Cir
cuit Court of Logan County issued a
rule against Stiles for contempt. After
hearing Stiles' answer to the rule Judge
Doolittle committed Stiles to jail to re
main there until the injunction pro
ceedings in the Federal court were dis
missed.
Stiles was placed in the County Jail
and an application was made to Judge
Jackson for a writ of habeas corpus,
which Judge Jackson issued and a
Deputy Marshal was sent to bring
Stiles before the Federal court. The
Sheriff and jailer refused, under in
structions from Judge Doolittle, to de
liver the prisoner to the United States
officer, and the officer, having reported
to the District Attorney, Jackson was
asked to issue a writ of attachment
against the Sheriff and jailer, the effect
of which was to bring these officers
with their prisoner before the court.
Attorney General Rucker of this State
requested Judge Jackson to delay the
Issuing of the writ till he can communi
cate with Judge Doolittle, which Judge
Jackson agreed to do. If Judge Doo
little refuses to give up the prisoner
an attachment will be issued, and If the
United States officers are resisted the
United States troops may be called on
to suppress the rebellion.

DESIRE A RECALL
Willing to Remain at Manila if There

DENVER, Oct. 31.â The following
cablegram was received to-day from the
regiment of Colorado Volunteers In serv
ice at Manila:
To Governor Adams. Congressional Delegates
and the Press of Colorado: Providing peace is
declared, regiment earnestly desires recall.
Rations insufficient; 1"> per cent sick. Cheer

TEERS.
NAPOLEON GUYOT, Chairman.
Governor Adams immediately tele
graphed the cablegram to the War De
partment, but from previous communica
tions on the same subject does not ex
pect any action will be taken. He said:
"I do not think the situation is quite as
bad as the cablegram would indicate. Fif
teen per cent is not a very large number."
"I think Ripans Tabules about the best thing
there is," said the Colonel; "I guess they are THE
best ! I was sitting the other evening smoking and drink-
ing a little whisky and water ; there were four of us there
and one complained of being very uncomfortable. When
he had told us about it I said to him, ' all that ails you is
indigestion,' and I gave him a Ripans Tabule from a little
vial I had in my pocket We each of us took one, and
since then I have learned that every one of the three has
bought the TABULES and thinks them the greatest
things there- are^ going."

PRESIDENT MASO'S
ADDRESS TO DELEGATES
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Oct. 31.âSe
nor Bartolomew Maso, president of the
Cuban Provisional Administrative
Council, has issued an address to the
delegates now in attendance at the
military assembly at Santa Cruz del
Â£ur, in which he reviews the consider
ations upon which the Cubans solicited
the help of the United States and indi
cates their wishes of the future policy.
The addivps in part is as follows:
The Cubans accepted the assistance of
America, although not knowing exactly
what wene the AÂ°nterlcan alms, just as
they would have accepted help from any
country in their fight against Spain. As
the contest progressed the Cubans in the
Held were gratified to hear of a solemn
declaration by the United States Con'
gress regarding the intentions of the
American Government and the path It
would follow in the Spanish-American
War.
The Americans came to our hejp to
compel Spain to relinquish her sov
ereignty over Cuba, in order that the
Cubans themselves might bÂ« placed as
promptly as possible in possession of the
Island, might assume the administration
of its affairs and have a government of
its own.
Therefore, the Cubans agreed to co
o^-rate with the Americans, to obey the
orders issued by American generals and
to help in all possible ways to establish
a Cuban Government when the Americans
took possession. Though America did not
recognize the Government ot the Cubans
It was well understood that the Cubans
would not on that account abandon their
organization, but that, on the contrary,
the time would come when ruch recogni
tion would Ye granted. Indeed, it was as-
I to our Cuban representatives by
one of the most distinguished menib"rs
of the United States Government, and
also by tho members of the United States
Senate, that in order to do away with any
u'le that might hinder the I'nitod
States in going into the fight for' the
cause of Cuban independence, recognition
of a Cuban Government must come later.
Nevertheless, it has not been possible to
establish direct relations between the
Cuban and American governments for
the transaction of the public business, al
though the general character of our rela
tions throughout the war was friendly.
But we have now reached a time when,
even more than in the days of fighting,
it is incumbent upon all Cubans to show
true patriotism, and while making every
expression of gratitude to America for
having given Cuba freedom and inde
pendence, to make prompt arrangements
for paying off the Cubans now in arms
and forgetting the country into working
order.
AMALGAMATION OF CIVIL
AND MILITARY DEPARTMENTS
SANTIAGO X>K CUBA, Oct. 31.âGen
eral Leonard Wood, commander of the
Military Department of Santiago, re
turned to-day on board the United
States gunboat Hist from Manzanlllo,
where he had been to consult with Col
onel Pettit, Military Governor r.f Man
zanillo, regarding the administration of
the district under the latter's control.
The Hist was eight hours late, owing
to the West Indian hurricane, and the
Joseflta, a much faster vessel, which
left Manzanillo twelve hours before the
Hist, is now ten hours overdue. Fears
are entertained for her safety.
The amalgamation â¢of the military
and civil departments under one ad
ministration, particularly such a man
as General Wood, who is thoroughly
posted, tactful and popular with all ele
ments, greatly facilitates the dispatch
of public business. I General Wood In
tends so far as possible to maintain
the original military , department lines
in the province, sending a regiment to
each district as the Spaniards evacu
ate. si" .".' â  sJ> . . - â¢â¢ ; â

REDHOTCAMPAIGN IN
THE <EYS T ONE STATE
Sensational Charges Made Against
the Democratic State Commit
tee's Chairman.
WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.. Oct. Sl.â More
fuel was added to the flames of Pennsyl
vania's furious campaign to-night when
Dr. Silas C. Swallow, the "honest govern
ment" candidate for Governor, boldly
charged that the Democratic chairman,
John M. Qarman, had made a proposition
to United States Senator Quay to "sell
out" the State Democracy. In support of
his accusations Dr. Swallow produced an
affidavit sworn to by E. C. Miller, a
traveling man. of this city. Miller swears
that on September 8 last he met on a
train between Williamsport and Philadel
phia, Charles E. Keck, a WHkeabarre
lawyer, who told him he was on his way
to Bee Quay with a message from Gar
inan. Keck, b.-ing a Republican, ex
plained his s.'!<M.-tion thus:
"German told me that he had lots of
men in the Democratic party, but nona
that he could trust with a mission of that
kind; that if certain legislation and fa
vors in certain counties were given to
Oarman be would insure those counties
- me (Republican candidate for Gov
ernor) and would offer positive evidence
that he could deliver the goods."
Miller aueges that they went tog-ether
to the Republican State Committee head
quarters, but Quay was in Atlantic City
ami Keck went there after him. When
the men met In Philadelnhia next day
Keck told Milier. the latter swears, that
he "laid the proposition before the old
man and he thought well of it." and he
was then arranging a meeting between
Quay and Carman.
Dr. Swallow said that Mr. Miner's state
ment was corroborated on many import
ant points by documentary evidence, hotel
registers, etc.. and that Mr. Miller volun
tarily related the .story.
The doctor said he made it public at this
time in response to the recent denuncia
tion of him by Chairman Garman In his
denial of the charge made by Dr. Swal
low that the leaders of the Democratic
party had sold out to the Quay machine.
NAVAL PROMOTIONS
AND RETIREMENTS
Dewey Likely to Be Made an Admiral
When Bunce Reaches the
Age Limit.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 31.â Rear Admiral
Miller will be place* on the retired list
on November 22. and the vacancy thus
created in the grade of rear admiral will
be tilled by the promotion of Commodore
H. L. Howison, commandant of the Bos
ton navy yard. On account of the promo
tion of Rear Admirals Sampson and
Schley as additional officers of the grade
they hold, no promotions could be made
at the time of the retirements of Rear
Admirals Sicard and Matthews.
Captain H. F. Picking will become a
commodore upon the retirement of Rear
Admiral Miller and â tfl'.l therefore have
to be relieved of his present duty in com
mnnd of the receiving ship Wabash. As
he has not been at sea since 1594 and will
not retire until 1902 he will probably be a
candidate for the squadron command
when the reorganization is begun upon
the ratification of the treaty of peace with
Spain.
Rear Admiral Bunce's retirement on
Decemher 25 will make Rear Admiral
Dewey the senior officer of the navy and
if Congress revives the grade of admiral,
as desired by Secretary Long, his ap
pointment to that rank will follow with
out any further Jumping.

KNOXVILLE. Term.. Oct. 31.â The
members of the War Investigating
Committee started early to-day upon
the investigation of the tamp at this
place with the hope of completing the
entire work here so as to enable them
to Btart for Washington to-night. They

The work in most cases was dis
patched rapidly, as it was made evi

would be comparatively little to do, the
camp being new and well located. More
time was spent at the hospital than
elsewhere. There are 250 patients here,
many of them showing typhoid fever
cases in all stages of development or
convalescence, but it is claimed the
fever was imported.
The commiFsioners manifested much
Interest in the report of an occurrence
on Saturday. There were three deaths
on that day among the colored patients
of the North Carolina Regiment. Two
of them were entirely unexpected by
the surgeon in charge, as the men were
not considered seriously ill. They,
therefore, seemed of the opinion that
these two had died from fright at see
ing their companions expire. There
were complaints among the troops of
the absence of stoves, and some of the
soldiers confessed a desire to get home,
but otherswise they were quite well
satisfied.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct. 31.â General

ARMY CONTRACT?
TO BE INVESTIGATED
NEW YORK, Oct. 31. â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: There will be some diffi
cult but important work awaiting
the investigation commission on its
return on a thorough ventilation of all
army contracts of the war.
If there are no specific charges of fraud
it is not because the feeling is one of sat
isfaction as to some of the colossal con
tracts that have been undertaken. In
some cases when bids were to be opened
well-known public men, some of them
United States Senators, have been- seen
busying themselves suspiciously about
matters, their connection with which the
public would like to understand. Others
insist upon asking just what called other
prominent men so often to the department
during the flood time of money-spending.
It is a rumor that persistently thrusts
itself forward that excessive sums have
been paid for vessels where favoritism
was at work. In one case a vessel, para
lyzed with age and infirmity, was bought
at a high figure. When the price and par
ticulars were asked the public press was
answered with insults.
There has never been a clear under
standing as to the contract by which
Spaniards were transported to Spain.
That the contract was broken there
seems to be little doubt, and that strong
influences were at work about the mak
ing of that contract was apparent to
those who were, intelligently observant of
the situation. If the charges are true
there will be a rich field for the investi
gation commission In the history of the
relations with the great transportation
companies. Probably the projected sec
ond Porto Rlcan expedition exploded by
the round robin may open up possibilities.
There was a mystery in the negotia
tions with transportation agents at which
even representatives of the press stood
baffled. The circuitous route taken for
the troops has provoked suspicious criti
cism. All may be cleared up before the
commission, but both these things, as well
as the charges of Inferior clothing issued
to the army, must have light thrown upon
them.
Already one story has been circulated
about uniforms and methods of purchase,
a Mr.' Bunburg being represented as
charging that it was through the services
of Abner McKinley that Blerman. Heidel
berg & Co. had obtained important con
tracts. This was denied to-day by
officials in the office of the quartermaster
gen ral.
M'ADOO CRITICIZFS THE
WAR MANAGEMENT
TRENTON. N. J., Oct. 31.â 1n the
course of a speech at a Democratic
mass meeting here to-night former As
sistant Secretary of the Navy McAdoo
criticised the administration on the
I management of the war with Spain. He
! said that the administration started off
! with the department lumbered with a
! lot of bureaucrats, and followed this
I by the appointment of sons of some
body and sons of nobody, without any
military experience, to positions of the
j greatest / responsibility. Camps were
I selected in out-of-the-way olaces and
! in spots where proper sanitation could
! not be had, and all because the men
I who made the selections knew nothing
i about the needs or were playing into
I the hands of the railroads. The lives
| and health of the men were intrusted
I to incompetents and the President and
! the Secretary of War did nothing to
i remedy this evil that in some respects
â  rivaled the Black Hole in Calcutta.
I All this, the speaker said, was because
! the War Department was controlled by
! politics.
He complimented the management of
\ the Navy Department. Referring to his
successor, Colonel Roosevelt, he said
he would deem it a privilege, if he were
in Colonel Roosevelt's place, to be able
to tell the American people of the mis
management of the Santiago cam
paign.

INDIAN WARDS
ARE VAGABONDS
Reservation Agent Ar
raigns Them.
SAYS WHITES ARE TO BLAME
OFFICIALS TOO LENIENT WITH
THE REDSKINS.
Permit Them to Live a Shiftless Life
and to Indulge In Gambling
and Barbaric Prac
tices.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 31.â The major
ity of the annual reports of the Indian
agents to the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs are of an encouraging nature
and indicate a progress generally along
civilized lines. Some of them, however,
are not so gratifying apd make sur
prising statements. Unusual In an an
nual report Is the following arraign
ment in that of E. M. Yearian, in
charge of the Lemhi Agency, in Idaho:
These Indians, as a tribe, are honest
and peaceable and kindly disposed, but
are about as degraded and ungrateful a
set as one finds. They have been humor
ed, and, like spoiled children, want thing*
their own way, and their condition, mode
of living and barbaric practices would in
dicate that undue concessions have been
made on the part of the agents. While
some avail themselves of the opportunity
of earning their living by civilised pur
suits, others lead a lazy, vagabond life.
They are addicted to gambling, horse
racing and dancing, and the influence of
the so-called "medicine man" operates to
the disadvantage of the tribe.
Their real advancement has not been
what it should, or what it was; possible to
have been under the circumstances. In
the agent's annual report for JRS2 on the
Lemhl Reservation, 1 nnd that twenty
nine Indlnn families were engaged in
farming. Fifteen years afterward I can
report but forty-one following the agri
cultural pursuits, an increase of twelveâ
not one convert a year. What wonderful
progress !
Morally, these Indians are practically
the same as they were twenty years ago;
financially, they are but little better off.
Aside from a few small farms, wagons
and farming implements, held by some of
the more energetic and industrious, they
have comparatively nothing except a
great number of worthless ponies, if they
did not own which they would not be any
worse off. No horned stock is owned by
them at all.
It would be unjust not to state that a
few have farms and keep constantly at
work trying to establish for themselves
comfortable homes. A majority, how
ever, seem to content themselves with
their present condition and continue in
the old channel, leading a life of Idle
ness and degradation.
Agent Fuller r' the Blackfoot Agen
cy, Montana, referring to the opening
of the ceded portion under the mineral
land laws last April, says prospecting
has been practically fruitless and pre
dicts the abandonment of the so-called
mineral strip before the Ist of Novem
ber.
J. R. Jewell, in charge of the New
York Agency, in his report, alleges
that, after careful Investigation he finds
that the funds of the Seneca nation are
almost wholly absorbed by the officers,
and that the latter are In collusion
with white men for such purposes.
Agent Jewell says:
The officers notoriously use the funds
of the nation to purchase trie votes of the
ignorant and illiterate Indians, who, on
election day, are always anxious for a
small sum of money. The better class of
Indians arc not numerous enough to over
come the power of these corrupt Indians,
who have the funds of the nation with
which to corrupt the masses and perpetu
ate their corrupt dynasty.

THE CENTRAL PACIFIC
Agents in Washington With a Plan
to Settle the Obligations of
the Boa a.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 31.â James Speyer
of Messrs. Speyer & Co. of New York
came to Washington to-day on matters
connected with the Central Pacific Rail
road. He had an interview with Secre

unable to see the Attorney General.
These three Cabinet officers form a com
mittee charged with investigation of tnc

port on the. same to Congress. The active
work of putting data into shape is being
done by Assistant Secretary of the Treas

of the city to-day. Speyer & Co. repre
sent the interest of Collis P. Huntington
in the Central Pacific, and have on hand
a plan of reorganization by which they
hope to relieve the Central Pacific of its
obligations to the Government and place
it on a sound financial footing. In this
th^y are opposed by a number of stock
holders, particularly those residing abroad
and in San Francisco.

CHASED ACROSS
TWO CONTINENTS
Bohemian Bank Official
Run Down.
EMBEZZLER OF A LARGE SUM
WAS ENJOYING A PROTRACTED
HONEYMOON.
Pounced Upon by a Chicago Sleuth at
St. Louis â Whereabouts
Made Known by a
Message.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 31.â After a chase
across two continents Lambert Wilt,
chief comptroller of the Bunglau Bank
at Bungbunzula, Bohemia, with his
wife and her aunt, was arrested at the
Hotel Roseacre to-day on the charge
of his having absconded with 109,000
guldens, equivalent to $41,420. The ar
rest was made by a Chicago detective
at the instigation of V. Zsmeskie, a
piano dealer at 624 Blue Island avenue,
Chicago, who is a stockholder and the
western agent of the Bunglau Bank,
and who had been instructed to search
for Wilt
Wilt has been married one year and
is 38 years old. His father is a pros
perous merchant at Bungbunzula. On
August 6 Wilt and his wife, accompa
nied by her aunt, Blaja Mullei, left
home on a vacation for his health.
They traveled through Austria and
came to America, landing at Hoboken
on October 3, where he wired his
mother of their arrival. Meanwhile
the bank officials had discovered a
shortage of 109,000 guldens and were
searching for Wilt. His message home
gave them a clew that he was in
America, and they notified their west
ern agent.
Wilt traveled through the East and
finally went to Chicago, whence he
came here last Thursday evening. A
detective was behind him two days
throughout his sojournings. The de
tective arrived here Sunday and ar*
rested the party of three to-day. Wilt
had $100 in United States money and
he and his wife both had a large
amount of Bohemian money concealed
in their clothing. Wilt admitted that
he took 12,000 guldens, but said he did
not take the balance of the amount ac
credited to him. He said friends at
Hoboken had advised him upon land
ing that he was being hunted. The
detective took the three back to Chi
cago at 9 o'clock to-night.

SANTA CRUZ, Oct. 31.â Henry T.
Gage, Republican nominee for Gover
nor, accompanied by the effective cam
paign orator, D. E. McKinlay, boarded
the 2:15 p. m. train to-day at San Fran
cisco for this place. Mr. Gage arose
from a sick bed to keep the appoint
ments made for him by the Republican
State Central Committee. The trip
along the bay and over the Santa Cruz
Mountains was delightful, in fact Mr.
Gage hp.d an opportunity to rest on the
road and arrived here refreshed by the
Journey. At many stations enthusias
tic Republicans were assembled' to
greet him. Mr. Gage alighted from the
train at Los Gatos and Boulder Creek
and had the pleasure of exchanging a
few wcrds with many of his ardent
supporters. At other stations he re
ceived delegations in the car and shook
hands through the open window with
those who failed to get inside. The
greetiiic, extended to him was cordial
in the extreme.
The train stopped for a few minutes
at San Jose, where the next Governor
and Mr. McKinlay were joined by Sen
ator H. V. Morehouse, O. A. Hale, Mel
ville Tenney and J. E. Mayes. These
gentleman of. Santa Clara County came
on to Santa Cruz and will return to
San Jose to-morrow with .Mr. Gage.
When the truin arrived at Santa Cruz
Mr. Gage was welcomed at the depot
by Chairman Ed Martin and Secretary
Benjamin A. Plant of the Republican
County Committee, H. S. Wanzer and
Henry Kron. Samuel Rucker, repre
senting Major Frank McLaughlin.
chairman of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee, also was at the rail
road station to prc-sent the major's
good wishes. Red fire on the grounds
of the major's seaside home signaled
the arrival of the next Governor.
To-night Santa Cruz was alive with
enthusiasm for Gage and Neff. A spe
cial train with 100 Republicans from
Boulder Creek arrived shortly before 8
o'clock. Hastings' band went to the
depot to escort the Boulder Republicans
to the Pacific Ocean House, where Mr.
Gage and Mr. McKinlay were waiting
for the procession to organize. Dele
gations came irom Sequel, Aptos and
Capitola and from the farms, orchards
and vineyards of the surrounding couri- j
try.
The meeting- at 2Vaval Reserve >
ArnJory was one of the largest
demonstrations of a political char
acter ever held in Santa Cruz.
The assemblage was called to order j
by Ed Martin, chairman of the j
county committee, who introduced K. ;
C. Kirby as the presiding officer. Among
itne prominent Republicans on the plat- j
form were \. . H. Galbraith, Mayor j
Lamb. James McNeil, Foster Young, C. j
E. Lindsay, O. J. Lincoln, H. F. Kron, :
W. A. Maguire, Duncan McPherson, H.
E. Cox, Henry Willey and F. W. Bald- |
win.
When the chairman uttered the words
calling the attention of the vast audi
ence to the objects of the meeting all j
the seats of the main floor and galleries I
of the spacious armory were occupied j
and the crowd seeking to gain admis
sion extended to the street in front of i
the building. It is estimated 3000 peo
ple sought to see and hear the next i
Governor of California.
The introduction *of Henry T. Gage j
was the signal for great applause long j
continued. The demonstration of wel- i
come reminded the. standard-bearer of
the great ovations which were recently
extended in Napa and Sonoma valleys j
and throughout the upper Sacramento ]
region. The enthusiasm signified that j
the masses recognized in Mr. Gage a
man of the plain people who had been j
called to bear their standard in this ;
campaign for good government and
prolonged prosperity.
Here in Santa Cruz, as elsewhere, Mr.
Gage gained friends by his modest and
manly bearing and instantly won the
confidence of the vast audience. Hie
voice was in fine condition. He spoke
for very nearly an hour without show
ing signs of fatigue. He did 2iot accept
the great demonstration as a personal,
tribute, but recognized in the outpour
ing of the masses an expression of re
newed devotion to the cause of which
he was the humble representative in
this campaign. The Maguire assaults
on the integrity of the Republican State
Convention were repelled, in a manner
that evoked an appreciative response
from the assemblage. He dwelt upon
his own career in California, reminding
his hearers that his attitude toward
railroad corporations had not changed
since he delivered a speech in Los An
geles more than twenty years ago,
when he took the position that a rail
road corporation had no right to inter
fere In the political affairs of the peo
ple. The railroad settlement question
in Congress was reviewed. Again the
inside facts were presented to the au
dience and the proof contained in the
pages of the Congressional Record
produced to show that Maguire as
sented to the amendment which was
now declared infamous by the fusion
leader. Reference was made to the
fact that Senators John T. Morgan,
Stephen M. White and in fact all the
Senators in Congress, Republicans,
Democrats and Populists, voted for an
amendment which Maguire denounces
as infamous.
The â¢"Little Giant's" effort to obscure
the vital issue of single tax by shout-
Ing "railroad" was clearly explained to i
thf audience.
Mr. Gage promised, if elected Gover
nor, to give the people of this State an
honest, clean, pure and business-like
administration. When he announced
that he would be elected Governor the !
applause was great and prolonged. He
spoke of the magnificent ovations of !
the campaign, the great popular up- ]
risings in support of the principles j
which he represented, and predicted |
that the Republicans on the Bth of No- I
vember would achieve the grandest vie- I
tory ever gained in California. This
prediction of party success evoked a
storm of applause from the enthusiastic
and patriotic audience.
Mr. Gage did not remain in the ar- |
mory long after he finished his address,
as he did not dare to take the risk of
petting cold. The vast audience, how
ever, remained to hear D. E. McKinlay,
the logical exponent of Republican doc
trine. Mr. McKinlay got a cordial greet
ing from the assemblage and proceeded
In masterly fashion to classify the lead
ing questions of the hour. He sub
mitted a proposition :to the judgment
of his hearers. He asked if the promises
made by the Republican; party in the
last campaign had not been fulfilled.
He asked further If ; the predictions
of disaster and adversity which the op
position made in the campaign of 1896
had been fulfilled. He asked the au
dience if the administration of Presi
dent William McKinley had not been
beneficial to the American people, and
if it was not deserving of the support
and commendation of the people of
California. A shout of applause testi
fied to the feeling that the national ad
ministration was -worthy of admiration
and continued support. V â¢ â¢
Mr. McKinlay in a lucid style ex
plained the meaning of the balance of
trade and submitted figures showing
that a low tariff had always cast, the
balance against this country and at the
same time deprived American workmen
of employment. The protective tariff
turned the balance in favor .of, the
United States and gave employment to
the people of this country. The eras
of prosperity and depression since 1832
were cited and the proposition ad
vanced that low tariffs had caused the
industrial distress in every period of
national depression.
A tribute- was paid to the patriotism
and wisdom of the administration, ex
emplified in the war with Spain. The
people were asked to consider if loy
alty to American principles and devo
tion to the country did not demand
that a vote of confidence in William
McKinley's administration should be
given at this time. The way to give ex
pression to this feeling: in California
was to support' the Republican cause
and give Ga^e and Neff an overwhelm
ing majority. * . '_ ...
The audience" responded to the senti
ment with rounds of applause. ; â _
: Senator H. V. Morehouse. one of the
ablest and "most eloquent orators in the
State; entertained the audience with a
brief address which elicited rin-ing re
sponses of approval. The hour was too
late for anything more than an appeal
to the Republicans and all other good
citiUis to protect; California .from the
reproach, of a fusion triumph. He pre
dicted" a Republican victory the mag
nitude of which would surpass all past
triumphs of the grand ââ¢ old party .in
The great demonstration at the ar
mory -oneof the greatest ever held in
â¢anta Cruz, has inspired the Republi
cans of this re-don with renewed zeal
in A^^e O mSin^nigM Mr. Gage
paid a visit to Major Frank McLa^h-
Un at the Hitter's resident. The ma
jor is in bed and under the care of a

morning for San Jose, where two meet
ings will be held to-morrow afternoon.
SAN JOSE'S PREPARATIONS
FOR GAGE'S RECEPTION
SAN JOSE, Oct. 31.â The reception to
be accorded Henry T. Gage, the next
Governor of California, in this city to
morrow will be the greatest political
event ever held In Santa Clara County
and a direct result of the good work
accomplished during the pre*nt cam
paign under the auspices of the Re
publican Good Government League.
The Santa Clara County Republican
Club, which has charge of the affair,
has recognized the importance of the
league, and given it the principal chair
manship. The greatest harmony pre
vails among the various factions of the
Republican party, so far as the State
ticket is concerned, and the demonstra
tion to-morrow will attest the united
support that the State and Congres
sional candidates will receive.
Messrs. E. A. Hayes, Rev. H. M. Ten
ney- and D. H- Bryant of the Good
Government League and O. A. Hale
and Senator H- V. Morehouse of the
Santa Clara County Republican Club
went to Santa Cruz this evening to
meet Gage and escort him to this city.
With Gage are Colonel E. F. Preston
and T. B. Hutchison. The party will
arrive here at 8:50 to-morrow morning
by the narrow gauge. It will be met
at the depot by a committee of promi
nent citizens and Army and Navy
League and escorted to Hale's Hall,
where from 9:30 to 11 a reception will
be tendered to old soldiers and their
families. At 11 o'clock Mr. Gage will
be taken to the St. James Hotel, and
there a public reception will be held
tilt 1:30.
At 3 o'clock mass meetings will be
opened simultaneously in the Audito
rium and Turn Verein Hall. J. R.
Patton, vice president of the Good Gov
ernment League, will preside at the
meeting in the Auditorium and Senator
H. V. Morehouse will be chairman at
Turn Verein Hall. Mr. Gage will open
the meeting at Turn Verein Hall and
Colonel Preston at the Auditorium.
Hutchison will follow Gage at the for
mer and Gage follow Preston at the
Auditorium. In this manner of rota
tion all three speakers will address both
audiences. Half-fare rates have been
obtained from near by points and it is
estimated 15,000 people will be present
to welcome Gage.
Unless the utmost harmony prevailed
it would be impossible to get up such
a jollification and reception in honor of
Gage. The Good Government League,
while opposed to Rea's county ticket,
is solid for Gage and the State and Con*
gresslonal tickets. In the systematic
canvass it has carried on the past
month at no time has it failed to urge
upon the voters the election of Gage
and the entire State ticket. The same
winning fight has been made for Loud,
and it is safe to say that the 2500 and
more votes of the Good Government.
League will be cast solidly for Gaga
and Loud. The league has done all
the actual work for the State and Con
gressional tickets in Panta Clara CounÂ»
ty this year, and the lethargy and idle
ness of Rea's County Central Commit
tee is drawing forth much adverse com
ment.
Under the banner bearing the pic
tures of Gage and Neff in front of the
Good Government League headquar
ters another banner, with the words
"Welcome Governor Gage," has been
strung. The Republican County Cen
tra' Committee has made no effort to
advertise the State ticket, while the
Good Government League has distrib
uted 5000 large cards with pictures of
Gage, Neff, Loud and their county
ticket broadcast in the city and su
burban districts.
MR. GAGE PRAISED
BY SENATOR WHITE
REDDING, Oct. 31.â One of the largest
crowds of the campaign filled Armory
Hall to-night to listen to an address by
Senator Stephen M. White. The speaker
was introduced by L. S. Barnes, and pro
ceeded at once to a logical and dispassion
ate discussion of the merits of the two
gubernatorial candidates. He spoke in the
highest terms of Henry T. Gage as a man,
and stated that this very evening he had
received a telegram from Los Angeles
asking his permission for use in the cam
paign of an indorsement of Gage for Code
Commissioner, made by himself several
years ago. The permission was granted.
' The distinguished speaker said that he
had known Henry T. Gage for more than
twenty yearsâ knew him to be a man of
great abilityâ and that he had no charges
to prefer. . Â ,
Touching upon the candidacy . of
Maguire, he reviewed the Democratic can
didate's career from boyhood to the pres
ent day He carried his audience from
the blacksmith's forge to the House of
Representatives, and declared that there
was not a blemish in Maguire s whole
private or political career. The Senator
held the attention of his audience
throughout a speech that was distin
guished for fairness and freedom from
personalities. He wae enthusiastically
applauded.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 31.âCongress
man Charles A. Barlow has in his cam
paign speeches of the last few days
denied that he ever attempted to se
cure 25 per cent out of a certain land
deal he was to push through at Wash
ington, involving $40,000.
The following letter from J. V. Web
ster, under date of Creston, and writ
ten a few days ago, shows Barlow in
his true light. Mr. Webster was the
Populist candidate for Governor four
years ago, and the letter is now printed
with his consent:
CRESTON, Oct. 23, 1898.
J. E. Cliff, Paso Roblesâ Dear Sir:
Your favor of the 20th inst., making in
quiry relative to the assistance offered by
C. A. Barlow to pass a claim through
Congress, amounting to $40,000, in favor
of John C. Fremont's hoirs, for a consid
eration of JIO.IKM). if before me. In reply I
have to say that during our State Alli
ance session, held in Man Miguel last
October, 1 had a conversation with Mr.
Barlow relative to the matter to which
you refer. ,
1 had previously received a clipping
from a L.os Angeles paper relating to
some incidents* in the Brooks vs. Barlow
lawsuit before the Superior Court of thai
city, which took place some time after
the last general election. In the clipping
referred to the statement was made that
Mr. Barlow testified under oath that he
had agreed to use his best endeavors to
secure a patent for some land claim in
Southern California valued at $40,000 for
the consideration of 25 per cent of its
estimated value. Seriously doubting the
truthfulness of this statement and wish
ing to do Mr. Barlow exact justice in the
premises, I handed him the clipping and
asked for an explanation. After care
fully reading the extract he replied in
substance as follows:
"This statement is not true. My testi
mony before the court related to an old
claim of John C. Fremont, contracted
against the Government when he was in
the State fifty years ago. The claim
amounts to $40,000, and I agreed to put it
i through Congress for 25 per cent of the
amount."
This conversation took place in my
room in the Levlnger Hotel, and there
wore present, if I remember correctly,
the following named gentlemen: S. O.
Pugh of Gonzales, Robert Shetterly of
Spencerville, Mark L. Landrum of Peach
Tree, P. W. Brewer of Creston, Mr. Bar
lo%v and myself.
This seemed to me a serious matter,
but, considering this agreement to com
mit a crime and the testimony relating
thereto largely due to his unsophisticated
status, I still felt kindly toward Mr. Bar
low, and upon subsequently receiving a
letter from him, in which he gave me the
chief credit for his election. I answered
that I had acted conscientiously in his
support, and that, under the circum
stances, would do so again. But as
matters stand now, like circumstances
can never exist this side of the River Jor
dan, and since then the report reached
me from Omaha, through Donnelly's
paper, "The Representative," that Bar
low and Castle, conjoined with other men,
holding proxies, and drawing in the
aggregate public salaries amounting to
J61.000 annually, came all the way irom
Washington and otht>r equally distant
places, with an eye single to sustaining
and abetting Marion Butler as chairman
of the National Committee of the Popu
list party, when, in fact, Marion Butler
had done everything in his power to fuse
our party out of existence for small bits
of pie and pottages skimmings for himself
ana the clique subject to his ruling.
These unpleasant remembrances,
coupled with Mr. Barlow's manifest
manipulation of our PopulUt conven
tion at Sacramento, and the conse
quent destruction of the Populist party
in this State, have caused our passing be
yond the "parting of the ways" to which
there can be no return. Yours truly,
J. V. WEBSTER.

on the matter to-day, said that despite
the claims of the young braves, who
threaten to take steps themselves unless
the Secretary orders the change, there is
nothing on file at the department that is
averse to Agent Clapp. He also states
that the agent is an army officer, who is
executing his duties satisfactorily, and
that the question of transfer is not to be
entertained.

POMONA, Oct. 31. â Until to-day the
Republicans In Pomona Valley hardly
believed they could so soon duplicate
their great mass-meeting of ten days
ago, but they succeeded beyond all ex
pectation. Henry T. Gage is far and
I away the most popular man in Pomona
| Valley whe ever ran for a State office.
He is known and loved here by hun
dreds of old-time residents, and it is
easy to get up big meetings in this
campaign for him for Governor. The
meeting: addressed here to-night by
Senator George C. Perkins and by ex-
Governor Beveridge of Illinois was one
of the largest known here in this cam
paign. The Pomona Opera-house has
proved too small for the audiences that
attend the Republican meetings, so a
large circus tent was hired for Repub
lican uses in the campaign. It was
crowded to-night and hundreds of peo
ple stood without within hearing of the
speakers' voices. People came into the
town fromrfill parts of the valley to at
tend the meeting and long before Sena
tor Perkins and ex-Governor Beveridge
arrived at the tent with the reception
committee every seat there was occu
pied.
Tremendous applause greeted the
first mention of Gage's name and when
the splendid administration of William
MeKinley was touched upon the audi
ence arose en masse and cheered and
yelled and waved hats and handker
chiefs.
Senator Perkins dwelt upon the Im
portance of this campaign to the suc
cess of the policy adopted by the Presi
dent. He toid what the war meant for
America and showed that unless Ameri
cans stand by the national administra
tion the war will have been useless.
Senator Perkins praised the Repub
lican State and Congressional tickets.
He showed how notwithstanding dis
couraging climatic conditions in South
ern California for two successive years
prosperity had come into this region
and was yet coming more and more.
Ex-Governor Beveridge spoke upon
State isrues and dealt with Republican
promises to build the Nicaragua canal.

the Democratic Nominee for

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 31.â At a meeting
of the Sacramento Trades Council to
night thÂ© following resolutions were
adopted:
Whereas. While the Sacramento Federated
Trades Council Is strictly non-partisan In Hh
character and has persistently decl.ned to con
sider matters of a political nature, yet It
deems it to be its duty to protest against, con
dern^ and repel unjust and malicious assaults
upon the character and integrity of Hon. A. J.
Johnston, an honored member of one of the al
lied branches of this federation; and to con
demn and censure the action of another mem
ber of this organ! zatlon-E. I "W oodman-in
lending himself to the circulation of anonj
mous literature in which such unjust and ma
licious assaults are made; and
Whereas This council knows eucn assaults
to be founded In malice and untruth and deems
the participation therein entirely beneath ar.a
unbecoming a member of this federation; and
Whereas The promise has been made by nail
Woodman that, in case of his election to the
office of Superintendent of State Printing, he
will effect a saving to the State of JICO.OOO, a
year in the administration of that office, know
ing full well that In order to even attempt to
fulfill said promise It would be absolutely nec
essary to reduce the wages of labor therein
and thereby work a direct injury to every mem
be" of a labor union finding employment In
that Institutionâ an institution which, under Its
present management, gives employment to
union labor exclusively; and
Whereas. Another anonymous circular has
been pat into circulation by the .agents or
friends of said E. I. Woodman, making an
outrageous, indecent and dastardly assault
upon the character and virtue of the poor
working-women, who, by reason of adverse
circumstances, have been forced to support
themselves and those dependent upon them by
the labor of their hands; therefore
Resolved, That this council recognizes In
Hon. A. J. Johnston a good citizen, a faithful
public servant and a zealous friend of or
ganized labor, and repels and condemns the
anonymous assaults made upon his integrity
as false and malicious.
Resorved. That this council hereby censures
and condemns the action of E. I. Woodman,
a member of an allied branch of this organiza
tion, in his personal distribution of such anony
mous literature, and denounces It as conduct
unbecoming one member of a labor union to
wan) another.
Resolved, That this cminrll condemns any
and every proposition tending to reduce the
scale of wages In the State Printing Office,
as is evidently contemplated If the promises
made by E. I. Woodman, as referred to above,
are attempted to be fulfilled.
Resolved, That we scorn and denounce as un
fit to associate with decent men and women
the man or set of men who will wantonly and
llbelously endeavor to besmirch the honor and
virtue of honent, hard-wnrking. respectable
women In an effort to make a point against a
political opponent. Such men deserve the ut
ter contempt of the whole community.
Resolved, That these resolutions be spread
upon the minutes of this council and copies
thereof furnished, under seal, to Hon. A. J.
Johnston and to E. I. Woodman and to thÂ«
press.
REA'S COUNSEL FILES
NOTICE OF APPEAL
Convicted Slanderer Will Carry His
Case to the State Supreme
â¢ Court.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 31.â "Jim" Rea's attor
neys have filed a notice of a motion for a
new trial of the slander suit brought by
J. P. Jarman which a few days ago re
sulted in the boss' conviction and a ver
dict for $1600 damages. This move on
Rea's part Is regarded as only a bluff, in
tended to put off the case until after
election. Everybody believes Rea will
pay the amount of the verdict, as that
would be cheaper than appealing the
case, and the boss might not care to have
all his testimony and nis record as a poli
tician aired again ar.d go before the Su
preme Court in a transcript.
â¢ The grounds <Â»n which a new trial is
asked are: Irregularities in proceedings
of court by which defendant was pre
vented having a fair trial; insufficiency of
evidence to justify the verdict; that ver
dict is against law, and that the court
erred in Its rulings and the instructions
to the jury. An order was made staying
proceedings until the motion for a new
trial be heard.
Tulare Register Reopened.
VISALIA. Oct. I.â The case of William
Simmons and forty-five other persons

been filed fifteen days before election, was
heard in the Superior Court to-day by-
Judge M'nor of Stanislaus County. Judge
Minor decided that the names should be
placed on the Register. This decision will

SUPERVISORS
GET AFTER THE
TAX COLLECTOR
Will Investigate Block
To- Day.
CALL'S CHARGES QUOTED
ABE MADE THE BASIS FOB PRO
CEEDINGS.
Judiciary Committee Will Ascertain
How He Gouged the City on.
Military Service
Lists.
The Democratic majority In the Board
of Supervisors were treated to a surprise
yesterday, when a resolution was intro
duced by Supervisor Smith providing for
an official investigation of The Call's
charges made last week against Tax Col
lector Block. It will he recollected that
this paper exposed gross irregularities in
Block's office, showing how he had se
cured a large sum of money wrongfully
from the city by enumerating among the
residents liable under the laws to mili
tary service large numbers of persons who
are legally exempt therefrom, taking pay
forÂ» these fraudulent lists at 5 cents per
name.
Since the expose it appears that several
of the Supervisors, including Smith, have
been busily at work securing evidence in
the case, all of which tended to corrobor
ate The Call's charges. Having found
such a bad state of affairs in Block's of
fice, it became the duty of the Supervis
ors to make an official examination; hence
the resolution by Smith. It reads as fol
lows:
Whereas. Grave charges have been freely cir
culated in the public press during the past
week, seriously calling into question the repu
tation of the present Tax Collector of the City
and County for official probity; and, whereas.
It has been related in a morning; journal of
large circulation that the said Tax Collector,
In the discharge of the duty imposed upon him
by sections 1595 to 1898 respectively, of the Po
litical Code of the State of California, haa en
rolled large numbers of citizens for military
duty who are declared to be exempt from such
duty by the provisions of the code heretofore
quoted, to wit:
State officers. Federal officers, Mongolians,
persons in excess of the uge described In the
statute, pi rsons exempt by reason of physical
disqualifications and persons who have Joined
the silent majority; be It
Resolved, By the Board of Supervisors of the
City and Count- of San Francisco .hat the Ju
diciary Committee be, and the same is, hereby
directed to immediately inquire whether these
charges have any foundation in fact, and to re
port to this board as soon as practicable the
result of Its findings, and what action, if any,
may be necessary In the premises.
Resolved, That the committee have authority
to send for persons and papers, and to employ
such assistance as may be deemed necessary to
present a proper statement of facts.
When the clerk closed the reading 1 of tne
resolution there was a dead silence.
"Are there any objections to it?" asked
Mayor Phelan.
None of the Supervisors made reply,
and, according to the usual custom, tne
Mayor announced the resolution passed
by unanimous vote.
A few moments later it was arranged
that the Judiciary Committee, of which
Smith is chairman, should hear the case
within twenty-four hours, and notice was
sent to Bock and witnesses against him
to appear at 10 o'clock this morning in
the Supervisors' committee-room for tne
Investigation. Sensational developments
are promised.
The Mayor's vetoes of gas and electric
bills were laid ov\r until after election.
The Hartford Athletic Club was granted
permission to give a boxing exhibition at
13 Hartford street, between November 1
and 15.
Alexander Wright, expert for the Grand
Jury in the investigation of ferry-depot
frauds, wafe allowed $585 for his services.
Considerable discussion arose over the
disposition of the architects' plans for the
proposed city and county hospital. As
the board had been advised that it could
not build the hospital, a motion prevailed
that a committee of three, consisting of
Dodge, Lackmann and Sheehan, should
meet the architects and ascertain just
what can be done toward returning the
plans. There are some persons who claim
that the members of the board will be
personally liable to the architects for the
plans. Inasmuch as the board had no au
thority to call for plans.
A special insurance fund was created to
be sustained by the contributions of the
foreign insurance companies, which have,
already placed $14,000 at the disposal of
the city. Some animated remarks arose
over the proposition to create the fund,
and Mr. Britt alleged that the $14,000 al
ready paid in was not available for use"
unless the special fund was created.
"That Is not correct!" exclaimed Mayor
Phelan. "The money is In the possession
of the City Treasurer and It haa been
counted!"
A laugh went the rounds of the room,
and the Mayor looked surprised.
Supervisor Devany presented two reso
lutions, one asking for an official request
to be made by the City on California
Congressmen, urging that they interest
themselves in securing a government
plant for San Francisco for the manu
facture of cannon, steel plates and other
war material. The other resolution ro
oupsted the Mayor to confer with the
State authorities so as to arrange, if pos
sible, for sending the eighteen lepers at
the Pesthouse to the Hawaiian Islands.
The full Board of Supervisors is now in
the city. Morton having returned from his
prolonged Eastern trip.
HIGHBINDER BULLETS
FOR DR. GARDNER
ADVISED TO KEEP AWAY FROM
THE MONGOLIAN QUARTER.
The life of Dr. Gardner, Interpreter for
the Chinese Bureau, has been threatened
again by the Mongolian highbinders en
gaged In Importing slave girls. The doc
tor has been a thorn In the side of the
coolie brokers by .his vigilance and fidelity
to his trust. In the midst of a seething
sea of corruption, with covert obstruc
tions placed in his path, he has preserved
himself free from even the taint of sus
picion. Hence he is the focus for the
bitter hatred of the highbinder element,
which thinks as little of killing a man as
smoking a cigar.
Yesterday morning a respectable China
man approached Dr. Gardner in the upper
corridor of the Appraiser's buildnig and
advised him to go armed, especially
when visiting Chinatown in the pursuit of
hi 3 official duties. He said the highbind
ers had been informed that Dr. Gardner
had been quoted in certain Washington
(DC) newspapers as having given the
Secretary of the Treasury certain im
portant information concerning the high
binders of San Francisco and their meth
ods and that they were very wroth in
consequence. The doctor's friends said
the highbinders had issued their usual
warning to a selected victim and that he
would do well to keep his eyes open when
traveling in the Chinese quarter.
The doctor yesterday laid the facts be
fore the Federal officials. He refuses to
carry arms, and the threat of assassina
tion will not force him to swerve from the
path of duty or to avoid the Chinese

Sunday night at the rooms on the corner
of Jackson and Dupont streets. It was
decided to raise the price on the heads of
two of the men who have been marked
for the assassin's bullets. D. Wing and
Chen Noon have had a price of $500 each
placed on their heads, and this was
ralÃed to $600. This price has been on the
heads of the two men for several months
and was put there at the same time the
$400 was placed on the head of Mock Foo,
who was murdered last week.

ered.
The police are searching for a Chinese
crook who ha# systematically entered a
number of houses during the past few
weeks and stolen various articles of jew
elry and wearing apparel. Mrs. Parker,
who lives at 1414 California street, is the
latest victim.
A Bhort time ago the thieving China
man visited her residence and represented
that he had been sent to get the washing
of a woman who rooms in her house. Mrs.
Parker went to the woman's room, and
while she was temporarily absent the
Chinaman entered the house and stole
three diamond rings valued at $200. The
ringa belonged to Mrs. Parker, but she
did not miss them until several hours
after the Chinaman had left.
Suspecting that he had taken them
Mrs. Parker notified Chief Lees, who sent
Detectives Gibson and Wren to make an
investigation. _
After obtaining a description of the
thief the detectives visited Chinatown in
the hope of locating him. While they
were searching for the culprit they ran
across the stolen rings in a pawnshop on
Clay street, near Stockton.
The proprietor Informed them that tne
jewelry had been pawned by a China
man, who claimed he had Just arrived
from Fresno, and that the rings had been
given to him by a friend.
Since then the thieving Mongolian has
robbed a number of housewives in a sim
ilar manner. His scheme is to learn the
name of a woman who lives in the house
he is about to rob. and, approaching the
landlady, he represents that she instruct
ed him 'to call for her washing. He car
ries on his shoulder a basket similar to
the ones used by Chinese laundrymen, and
when the mistress of the house leaves
him to call the woman for whom ne asks,
he enters the place and steals whatever
he can lay his hands on. In the last few
weeks it 'is said, he has managed to get
away with at least $500 worth of property
by these means.
As he is known to Gibson and Wren
they confidently expect to arrest him in
the next few days.
Sending Dead Chinamen Homo.
"Within the last ten days the Health
Office has issued eighty uennits for the
removal of the remains of deceased
Chinamen from the Chinese burying
ground In San Francisco to Peking. This
extraordinary number of removals has
brought $SOO extra revenue to the Health
Department, a charge of $10 being exacted
for each removal permit.

\A AYOR PHELAN has never made ;a : formal;
/ \ announcement of his ; ideas concerning the. re
* * iation oi wages to work, : but he has on several
ocaibions made statements on. specific cases â  which
show that in his judgment .the average wage-earner in
San Francisco'iis overpaid.: He: :has stated- that -the'
city lampiighters and the City: Hall janitors should be
paid less than they now.receiye. .-;' "â¢ â  ,;.â  , / . 'â  ./ ; \
These two instances show how the ..Mayor would
lighten the burdens of corporations and the .expenses
of the city.- lie would make a reduction in the wages
of the gas company's lamplighters and .iin the wages
of. the men -who are charged with the duty, of taki.ng
care of the City Hall. It matters little; to him; that
the lamplighters; and the; janitors; eyen.- at present:
wages : hardly earn enough to support their fafnilies.;
that their' earnings for a year will hardly equal his
expenses for a week. It is ; enough: for'.him. that he be
lieves lie could get men to do the'.w.ork for less pay. :
cn-.rse Mayor Phelan Iha.s. riot nia.de such, state
ments during the campaign. : He is now. bidding. 'for.
the votes of the workingmen :and talks loftily of .good
wages, just as he talks .to independent. Republicans
of his virtuous opposition to Rainey. While he was
dealing with the city lighting .problem, however^ and
with the expenses of maintaining the .City : ?Hall, -and
while the election was yet a. long way. off. he: was..
frank and open in his declaration :, that the lamp-,

The hypocrite has now been' -exposed.' .The. work
ingmen see him as an advocate, of lower wages, .and
Republicans see him as : a secret .â¢conspirator with
Rainey for a division of municipal, patronage. . He
will, if elected, bow to Rainey in the- distribution of
the spoils of office, and then try to make a record for:
economy by reducing the wages; of, every working

LET THE FLAG fLY. S-
A CO RR ESPO N D ENT writes to ask if: it is. cus
tomary to fly the. flag : on : Thariksgi.ving iday,
and to suggest that if it is not. now : is a; good
time to begin. He adds /that there. . never ; .has
been a time when so many people had flags, so that
a display of them would be a simple: matter." .;â¢.."'
It seems to us the idea, is an one. There
cannot be too free a showing of the national colors.
That they should be on view Thanksgiving is appro
priate always, and this year there is more reason than
ever for it. The nation has. reason Mo be grateful.
The flag has been borne to victory wherever it has
met a fee. The .flag is the visible sign of our unity.
It carries with it the thought .of loyalty. .: When it
waves patriots are under its shadow. A sight of it
stirs the emotions. It means more to the younger
generation than it meant before they had seen brave
boys go forth to fight for it and had heard of the valor
with which these boys faced deadly fire. â  ' *' \
Every year there is a national Thanksgiving proc
lamation. Sometimes it is perfunctory. This year it
has in it the ring of sincerity. There are things for
which this great people may fittingly offer words of
gratitude. Armed for the cause of humanity, the re
public went to a war which victory and honor have
crowded. When bur troops rushed up the hills of
San Juan, when before Manila they braved a storm
of lead, there was the flag to lead them. Every heart
felt a thrill at the presence of the stars and stripes. As
the colors were planted above territory wrested from
the enemy a thrill of pride and satisfaction was felt
throughout the land. So in recent history, as in le
gend, the flag is associated with triumph, with honor,
achievements and love of country.
Let it wave on the day of thanksgiving. We will
offer up praise for the valor of our arms, and the flag
stands for that patriotism which is ready to yield life
and fortune when the country calls. Fling the flag
to the breeze and then offer a pean that it may be per
mitted to wave with no spot nor blemish upon it, the
token of a perfect brotherhood, the emblem for
whose unsullied honor millions are ready to die.

man's naturalization papers. There is a grave sus
picion that Henley owes fealty to Mexico.
Those Vienna doctors will never trifle with the

The Examiner devotes much space to a recital of
the virtues of Phelan. Really, that sheet is running
too much to fiction.
Nobody who heard Phelan's speech at Sacramento
ever expected to see the little Mayor on his knees be
fore Harney.
Just as a matter of political foresight Barry and
Henley ought to have paid their taxes.
PHELAN'S POLITICAL MORALS.
LET no one think it is any pleasure to a news
paper to find a public man false where he should
be true, faithless where he should be faithful,
pretending where he should be sincere.
It is not with any pleasure that we have exposed
Air. Phelan's appalling hypocrisy in reaching out for
the support of reformers and purists and Non-Parti
sans with one hand, and with the other for that of the
classes and bosses whom he has denounced.
Moore, in his "Veiled Prophet," has drawn a pic
ture of false pretense that will live through the ages.
Since it was written men have often seen Mokanna
in the midst of them, commanding the purest faith,
the most unbounded enthusiasm, the highest sacrifice,
only to abuse them all, and when his veil was lifted to
expose the repellent features of greed and selfish
ness. . .
Phelan has played this part with great address. If
Moore had taken him as the suggestion of his story
of Khorassan he could hardly have drawn it closer to
the model. Â
V The fancy of this State will never let go the picture
of some. men, who in high place have justified the
hope invested in them. Governor Irwin was such a
man. He sought office frankly and administered it
laboriously and with instant attention to all of its
duties. He was reckless of present popular applause,
disregarded the dress parade of his official station and
seemed thoughtful only of faithful discharge of his
duty, leaving that to perpetuate his memory.
Sargent was such a character. in : the Senate. No one
recalls him either as a poseur or as holding office as. a : .
gratificatioh. of persohai vanity.. Such, men have an
ideal which: forbids that they barter, prmeipres or talk
with two mouths for the sake of honors -md power.
,T6" them public office .is. simply a change of. work,
from the private to the public station. But Mr. Phe
lan's. ideals : a.re different. :He wants the exhilaration
of public elevation^ the .gratification of vanity, the
sense of being. .better, than his fellows, without ac
quiring the moral qualities or exhibiting the practi
cal genius which would, justify the claim.
â To. him ambition is a feather,, an ornament, a stripe
on i his- trousers, ,a ;. -brass belly band and sword, a
sp.ontqon, a cockade, rather. than a sober desire to
abide .by. fixed principles and follow their lead to the
: goodof. others V.. ..: â¢â¢/ .. â¢ ' .â¢ "â¢ â -. .â¢ â 
'.' It is- natural, therefore, that he should -fall- as ; he ha?:

' : His treaty. With the Harney-Rainey. combination is
the; complete revelation of his' character,. It is the lift

professions fall. -Nothing is left of him except an am
bition .that is now. exposed as a public danger, be

nals worse, than he. has. alleged them to .be become

Let every one watch the result of the meeting of
Harney*s committee 'and see whether it will manfully
reject the public patronage which Phelan has so un
manfully. offered as a bribe for supporting him.
; WHfIT WILL THEY DO ?
â  I fNLESS. Deacon. Fitch's Non-Partisans desire to
I forfeit the respect of every voter who in past
â¢â¢V-r years has supported their principles and candi
dates they.; will take immediate measures to investi
gate and act upon the charge that Mayor Phelan has
offered the Harney faction a portion of his patronage
in return for their votes. The Non- Partisans have
indorsed substantially the entire Phelan ticket. It the
bargain referred to had been concluded the Mayor
would have sold the Deacon's party bodily to Rainey
and the politicians under his command. The at
tempted trade, therefore, was an attempt to sell the
Non-Partisdis to the bosses. \
It is true that Phelan's offer was not accepted and
that the fight between the Democratic factions will
go on as before; but the interest of Deacon Fitch's
Non-Partisans in the matter is none the less vital for
that. The Deacon is a reformy. He fights bosses
and corruptionists wherever he finds them. He is a
Republican, but that fact does not deter him in his
pursuit of rascals in his own party. He has united his
fortunes with Phelan because he says he believes the
Mayor is out for pure politics and an honest admin
istration of the law. How/ Phelan ever managed to
convince the Deacon that he is politically honest may
continue to be a mystery, but for present purposes
we are assuming that the Non-Partisan boss wourd
never have combined with him unless he had reason
to believe that a Fitch government would follow.
The attempt of Phelan to purchase the votes of the
Harney faction of the Democracy must knock the
scales off the Deacon's eyes. That attempt was a
move worthy the most corrupt political boss who
ever existed. The Mayor acknowledged his boss
ship when he assumed that he could keep his part of
the agreement, and he proclaimed the "purity" of his
sentiments when he proposed to sell "good govern
ment" for votes. If the Harney factionists are fit to
hold office under Phelan they are fit to participate in
primaries and sit in conventions with his dummies.
We have been telling Deacon Fitch all along that
the Phelan candidates have promised their patronage
to the "organization" formed by the hefting boss.
We have warned him that in delivering the votes of
the Republicans who have in the past followed his
leadership to Phelan's ticket he was committing an
offense against fair and decent politics which would
cause a Croker or a Buckley to hesitate. Yet he has
persisted in his mad desire to assist Phelan to place
and power. . .. : . :.
Now that the whole plan of the Phelan-McNab con
spiracy for capturing the offices has been exposed, it
is pertinent to inquire what are Deacon Fitch's Non-
Partisans going to do? Do they approve of the
Mayor's offer to Harney? . Are they willing that one
third of the patronage of the city shall be given to the
t "scoundrels" and "rascals" who for many months
THE SAT* FKAJN CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, 1, 1898.
have been resisting Phelan's amazing usurpations in
the local Democratic party? In short, are the Repub
licans, who comprise 90 per cent of the Deacon's fol
lowing, going to indorse the kind of politics prac
ticed by the Mayor and upon which he depends for
capturing the city?
These are pertinent questions, and large numbers
of respectable citizens are anxiously looking to Dea
con Fitch and his followers for an answer.
MAGUIRE OND LAND CONFISCATION.
AS has been shown, every single tax organ and
advocate in the United States and Canada
points to Maguire's candidacy here as a battle
for land confiscation. The Boston Herald, an organ
of that policy, says: "Monopoly on the part oi the
land-owners who have held real estate for the un
earned increment has been one of the heaviest bur
dens the State of California has had to bear. Judge
Maguire makes his professions of tax reform without
qualification whatsoever, and he hopes to have elected
with him at the same time a sufficient number of
Senators and Representatives to control the State
Legislature, and in this way make practical the re
forms he is advocating."
This declaration, by one of his outside organs, of
what Maguire is hoping to do, makes very necessary
a constant examination of his intentions as so cop
iously expressed in his speeches and writings. On
December is, 1897, he said, in the National Single
Taxer, No. 46, vol. 6:
"We propose to raise all public revenue on land
values.": ' ':â¢
"We propose to exempt all personal property from
taxation." ' '.'â¢â ?.-â  â¢'â¢..
"We propose to abolish poll tax."
"We propose to exempt from license all business
enterprises."
"WE PROPOSE TO DO AWAY WITH ALL
VESTED RIGHTS AND TITLES AND OWN
ERSHIP IN LAND AND RAISE THE PUBLIC
REVENUE FROM LAND RENTAL."
Of this "rental value," which figures so largely in
the technology of the land confiscators, Henry George
says: "I think it necessary to raise the rate of taxa
tion high enough to take as near as may be the whole
of that value. Unless you go on you will leave a mar
gin for the owners of the land."
If a man own land that yields him a profit of $1000
a year over and above his living, that profit, which is
the rental value, is 5 per cent on $20,000, and he may
estimate that as the value of his land. But Henry
George says in his speech in St. Louis, published in
the National Single Taxer of December 15, 1897: 'As
you increase the tax on that land the selling value
will diminish. If you tax it $1000 per year the selling
value will be gone. It would be worth nothing to
own, but would be worth just as much to use as be
fore. That is to say, the man who wants to use that
land to-day would give a thousand dollars for the use
of it under the present conditions, but the owner puts
that in his pocket and will not sell the privilege of ap
propriating that thousand dollars per year except for
$20,000. Now, if you are to take that thousand per
year for the use of the community the selling value of
the land would disappear, the owner would get noth
ing, the community would get the thousand dollars."
That is probably as clear an explanation of the pro
cess of destroying landed property in the hands of its
owners as has been made.
Judge Maguire applies the confiscation to the
miner and the mines. In a speech made in Congress
January 31, 1894, he said: "The great natural de
posits, such as coal, iron, gold, silver, copper, lead,
petroleum, quicksilver and the like, under the earth;
and forests over the earth, were prepared and stored
by the Creator for the general use of all mankind.
IT IS RIGHT THAT THEIR VALUE SHOULD
BE GIVEN TO THE WHOLE PEOPLE
WHENEVER PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS EX
TRACT THEM FROM THE EARTH."
We think there is no misunderstanding these utter
ances. Every land-owner in the State and every
miner can figure out for himself what will happen to
his property if Maguire's influence to promote its
confiscation is increased by electing him Governor.
THE SUPREME COURT TICKET.
q BITTERLY abusive and thoroughly vicious
l\ light has been made by the iusionists ever since
â¢ â¢ the opening of the campaign against the Re
publican nominees for the Supreme Court. The at
tack led by the Examiner and followed in the degree
of their depravity by other spokesmen of the factious
of discontent has carried bitterness to the verge of
malignancy, and abuse to the extent of downright
lying persisted in after repeated exposures and refu
tations and after the openly expressed scorn of the
better class of Democrats themselves.
Nothing more clearly evinces the anarchistic ten
dencies of the Maguire factions than this attack upon
two Justices of the Supreme Court, and indirectly
upon the court itself. It is in the courts that law is
most visibly embodied under our form of govern
ment, and accordingly it is against courts that the
growing lawlessness of the demagogues most forcibly
shows itself. Every nascent anarchist sees in these
tribunals the symbol of constituted authority, the in
violate temple where justice protects life and prop
erty; therefore he hates the court and is never so
vicious as when assailing and slandering the Judges
who preside there.
The Supreme Court of California holds a high and
honored place among the great tribunals established
by the American people. Its dignity was never
higher than at present, its decisions were never more
noted for justice, learning and equity. Among the
jurists who have thus ably upheld the best traditions
of the court are Justices Van Fleet and McFarland,
who are now candidates for re-election. No man of
repute or moral responsibility speaks of them in other
words than those of praise and commendation. Yet
it is against these men the Examiner has concocted'
its worst slanders and repeated its attacks with the
most vicious iteration.
It counts for nothing to a man of anarchistic ten
dencies that his slanders are lies and that the people
know them to be such. It does not affect him in any
way to refute his falsehoods and to expose his malig
nancy. Anarchy is a species of monomania. It is as
careless of human opinion as of human life. It ap
proves of a lie as it approves of a murder. It is as
reckless of popular scorn as it is of the truth itself.
When it has once invented a lie the votaries of
anarchy will go on babbling it as long as liberty al
lows them to live with unwhipped backs and unslit
tongues.
Fortunately the common sense of the American
people can be relied upon to save the courts from any
danger that may be threatened by such slanderers as
these. Justices Van Fleet and McFarland will not
suffer on election day from the attacks made upon
them. They have shown themselves to be just and
upright in maintaining law and doing equity upon the
Supreme bench, and with honor the people will re
elect them.
Maguire might have with consistency secured
Louise Michel to do some stumping for him.
THE ARTFUL DODGER.
NUMBER TEN.
The plain citizen wants good government. You and I are especially
concerned in that result of good government known as low taxes. The
plain citizen pays the taxes, and he is drawn to any party that promises to
lighten his burdens.
THEREFORE THE CRY OF LOW TAXES IS A POPULAR CRY
In political campaigns. But the plain citizen has had a long experience of
campaign cries. He knows that they are merely dodges to catch votes. The
politicians who promise so much before election are careful to perform as
little as possible after election.
The reason is that most of those promises cannot be fulfilled. We
must give the devil his due, and the politician is willing enough to do all he
can after election without hurting his own interests. The trouble is, how
ever, that before election they promise great results by inadequate means.
When they are in office they see the truth, even if they did not see it when
they were candidates.
They find their promises cannot be' kept, and the plain citizen chalks
down another bad mark against the politician. Hence it is the duty of
the plain citizen not to be carried away by mere campaign cries. He must
use his intelligence. He must not only listen to the promise, but he must
inspect the means which are offered for its fulfillment. If his common
sense tells him that these means are not suited for the object in view, the
plain citizen is justified in
SUSPECTING THE SINCERITY OR THE BRAINS OF THE CAN
DIDATE.
If a man comes to you or me and promises to haul a load of rock
from the park to the ferries we do not take him merely at his word. If he
tells us that he intends to perform the feat in half an hour by hitching two
of the playground goats to a wagon that two horses move witn difficulty
when empty we suspect his sanity. If he demands his pay in advance and
asks us to trust to his honor for the performance of the contract we begin to
look around for the police.
This is precisely the position in which Mr. Phelan stands before the
people. He promises us low taxes, he promises us that if he is elected Mayor
and Mr. Dodge Assessor low taxes will surely come. We do not believe
him. We doubt his sincerity. The plain citizen, that, is, you and I, knows
by experience that the sole result of his promised performance W 9" l(^ ?e? c
the shifting of the burden from the rich to the poor. We are justified in
treating those who come to us with a hypocritical cry as hypocrites.
BUT LET US SUPPOSE
For a moment that Mr. Phelan's contention is true and that the Assessor
can by changing assessments relieve the plain citizen of some of his bur
dens. In the first place we must have taxes. If we are to have a beautiful
city we must pay for it. We have always kept the system of paving as you
go, and thus we have no debt on the municipality. Mr. Phelan is so anx
ious that we should have low taxes that he advocates the issue of bonds and
the creation of a debt so that we may not only have the pleasure of paying
the running expenses of the city as now, but that we may have the additional
honor of paying interest on bonds besides. Of course this is a portion of
Mr. Phelan's policy that he discreetly hides behind Dr. Dodge's charts when
he addresses the horny-handed sons of toil of whom he is one. . â ;
HENCE AS WE MUST MEET OUR EXPENSES; f:
The tax levy can never be materially reduced. For political .purposes it is
quite possible to keep down the rate for a year or two, but the floating
debt steadily increases, and if we are honest it must: be paid. .' v
Mr. Phelan claims to have forced the Supervisors to cut down the tax
levy a year ago. He says nothing of the yawning deficits which face every
department and cripple them all. The deficits must be met: next year or the .
year after. It is a very small saving for the plain citizen to boast that he has:
run his house for $1000 a year, when he knows that there is $5000 out
standing against him in honest bills. :.
Again the plain citizen does not object to a low tax levy; but he does object
to the manner in which Mr. Phelan proposes to accomplish it. Mr. Phelah
allows as much water as ever to come in through the leak in the ship. and.
he thinks that he can fool the people into believing that the danger is past
by using only one pump. If the plain citizen wishes to get a low tax levy
let him not pay his officials so much, nor spend so much money on parks,
police, Fire Department and schools. But it is the rankest absurdity for Mr.
Phelan to demand that these be kept in their present state and then economize,
by paying them in promises and not in coin. Of course the day of reckoning
is staved offâ perhaps until Mr. James D. Phelan is safely housed, in the
United States Senate; but the plain citizen, like you .and I, will some day : ;
have to face the inevitable in the shape of a tax levy that will haimt our
waking and our sleeping hours. : . . .; . ;â â â 
For these reasons we may take it for granted that the expenses of the
city will keep on increasing in about the same rate as in the past. Now,
Mr. Phelan and Mr. Dodge say that in meeting these expenses corporations
do not contribute their fair share. They say that these corporations make,
their money by supplying public needs. Their value comes from the people.
Therefore the people should be the chief beneficiaries by their profits.
WE HAVE THEN IN THIS CITY THREE CLASSES
Of property. First, real estate with the buildings thereon. Secondly,
money. Thirdly, the intangible something known as rights and franchises;
as, for example, the right to use a street for water pipes or electric
wires, and the franchises given to street car companies.
Now, Mr. Phelan and Mr. Dodge are saying that the first class of prop
erty, real estate, is bearing too much of the burden, and the third class; or
corporations, too little. They say: "Assess these latter justly and real estate
will be relieved. The poor man's lot is now overloaded; shift the burden
to the street cars and the water pipes and the plain citizen will have relief.''
THE PLAIN CITIZEN IS AN OBSERVANT MAN. â¢
He notices that Mr. Phelan speaks as if there were only two classes of tax
able property in the cityâ real estate and franchises. He forgets or passes
over the far' more important item of money. The town is full of banks. If
the railroad and the water company are making illegitimate profits the
banks are making illegitimate profits also. The proof is that the stock of
the banks is selling for just as good a price as the stock of the railroad com
panies. If the franchises should Day more in taxrs the banks should pay
more in taxes. The plain citizen, like you and I, Joes not make distinc
tions between corporations. A corporation that runs a bank is precisely the
same to us as a corporation that runs a street car. Why does Mr. Phelan
shout so loudly about the street franchises and say nothing about bank
charters? Can it be that the pure and disinterested exponent of good gov
ernment has none of his money in street cars, but has much of it in banking
corporations? Of course it may be a mere oversight that Mr. Phelan is not
clamoring for an Assessor to raise the taxes on a certain savings bank; but
the plain citizen "thinks a power" when he sees James D. Phelan's name
heading the list of directors.
BUT MR. PHELAN AND HIS ASSESSOR
May object that private corporations like banks are not to be put on the
same level as the great quasi-public corporations like street railroads.
The railroad exists because of the people. It is a public utility. Its
value is given to it by the people, therefore a very large share of its profits
should go to the people. But Mr. Phelan is very careful to hide away the
fact that a certain class of real estate is. also a public utility. He lumps all
real estate together, and, pleading for lower taxes on the plain citizen's lot
in the sandhills, he is also pleading for lower taxes on his own holdings on
Market street. But the plain citizen's lot on the sandhills is not at all in
the same class as Mr. Phelan's lots on Market street. The plain citizen's
lot has value solely as the plain citizen's home. Mr. Phelan's lot has vnlue
as a business block. Now. what srives a business block value? Location.
The Phelan building in Cow Hollow would be worth nothing; it is worth
millions at the corner of O'Farrell and Market streets. Why does location
give it value? Because of the number of people who are gathered around it.
who pass it, who are brought close to it. Business location depends en
tirely on facility of access. The more people that pass a store the more
sales will the storekeeper make. But everybody knows that you can meet
a thousand people in two ways; you can either stand on the corner of Mar
ket and O'Farrell streets, and the thousand people will pass you in a few
minutes; or you can take a street car in a less frequented district, and you
will pass a thousand people in the same space of time. If the street car
is a public utility so is the location of the Phelan block. Both draw their
value from the people and both therefore should be treated by the people
with the same measure.
BUT MR. PHELAN HAS NO DESIRE
To see his building taxed as a public utility. He puts it on the same basis
as the poor man's lot and strives to shirk taxation by dodging behind the
poor man's back.
Mr. Phelan is not in politics simply for his health. He is not in politics
simply for ambition's sake. He is in politics for the good solid reasons
that every other boss is in politicsâ self-interest. He wishes to protect his
own holdings from just taxation. Like the sneak thief in "Oliver Twist."
he points the accusing finger at the other fellow while his own pockets are
bulging with the spoils. The plain citizenâ -that is, you and I, must not be
ghosted by a campaign cry. Let us keep our eyes open and our heads clear
and we shall see that Mr. Phelan and his Assessor are a pair of artful dodgers,
who believe that the people love to be fooled, and are out to fool them in the
name of good government. PLAIN CITIZEN.
GENEEAL MILLER REU.EVED.
Major Kinzie Assigned to the Tern- j
porary Command of the Presidio.
Orders were issued yesterday from de
partment headquarters 'relieving General
Marcus P. Miller from command of the
Presidio. This was done because General
Miller will leave shortly for the Philip
pines. Major Kinzie of the Third United
States Artillery, stationed at Alcatraz
Island, has been temporarily assigned to
the command of the Presidio, pending the
arrival of Lieutenant Colonel Wagner.
Fourth Cavalry, who should have report
ed here last week. It is not known when
Colonel Wagner will arrive. He was
granted a sick leave by fhe War Depart
ment, and this has on several occasions
been extended.
At department headquarters yesterday
it is expected that the Pennsylvania will
?et away to-morrow or Thursday and the
Newport and the City of Puebla the last

who has been stationed in Florida, re
turned to the Presidio on Sunday night.
Captain Brandt is in baa health? and it L
is reported that he will shortly appear !
before an examining board with a view to
being retired on account of physical dis
ability.
There was a report in circulation yester- '
day that Major General Shatter had ar
rived in the city on Sunday night; but it i
proved to be utterly unfounded, as Lieu- !
tenant Colonel Greene yesterday received i
a dispatch from General Shafter, which
was sent from Governors Island, New
York-
Navigator Butt Departs.
Lieutenant Butt, the warlike navigator
of the revenue tug Golden Gate, the terror
of timM mates of tanbark schooners, has
been reiU ved from duty on this coast and
ha*! be- assigned to protect the harbor
of New fork. He will take his 32-caliber
revolver with him, and it is expected that
the Battery will quiver with the terror of
his name. Lieutenant Buhrer of New
York, who has done excellent service on
the revenue cutter Bear, will take his
place in this port.

THE FIRST SCHOOLâ O. G., City. The
first American school in San Francisco
was opened on the block west of Dupont
street, between Pacific and Broadway, by
a Mr. Ma^ton, in April, 1847. It was a
private enterprise. On the 21st of Febru
ary, IS4B, a Board of School Trustees was
elected, and on the 3d of April following it
opened a school on the plaza, with
Thomas Douglass as principal, but a
tariff of tuition was fixed. On December
26, 1849, John C. Pelton opened a school
in the Old Baptist Church on Washington
street, near Stockton, without cost to
pupils, depending- on contributions and
voluntary subscriptions. In 1850 he ap
plied to the City Council for relief. -I/he
Council allowed him and ffls wife $500 per
month. As it was supports by public
funds It was called a public school, the
first In the city.
CARRYING A PARLOR RIFLEâ*!. M>
C, City. It is to be presumed by thÂ«
question asked in relation to the right tÂ»
carry a small parlor rifle farther than the
Cliff Hou3e that you have reference to
being on the great highway. That thor
oughfare Is under the jurisdiction of the
Board of Park Commissioners, and an or
dinance of that board says that it is un
lawful to carry a firearm or discharge the
same on any street, highway or avenue
under the control of the Commissioners.
If you mean on the hills east of the Cuff
House or north thereof, you will come in
conflict with the city ordinance that pro
hibits the discharge of firearms within 300
yards of any street or dwelling. If you
are very anxious "to practice with a small
parlor rifle at seagulls," ride as far as
Ocean View, take the road to the ocean
beach and you will find yoursek outside
of the limits of the city and county, and
there you may practice to your heart's
content providing that you are careful
not to interfere with the rights of others
who may be on the beach.

BY HON. WEBSTER DAVIS
Assistant Secretary of the Interior Prophesies
a Great Yietory for Qage
and Neff.
He â  Discusses lie Past Record tf the Democratic! Party
and Shows That Prosperity Has Only Beeii
Had Under Republican Admin
istrations.
I <-.n. Webster Davis, Assistant Sftcre
j.j of the Interior, addressed a larare
enthusiastic gathering of citizens at
:>dwazd>. Pavilion last, night. ;â¢â  E"6r
nearly: one -an^Va ;halt hours .he discussed
the principles of the .Republican party as
opposed to thc>s.Â» pt '-the; Democratic. His
remarks were f orcit)l-e, terse and logical,
and evoked the greatest enthusiasm.
Ex-Justice Van R. Paterson, the chair
man, of the evening, was introduced to
the meeting by Colonel George Stone, and
â while the crowd Was ' waiting for Mr.
Davis he spoke briefly on the issuee at
stake in this; campaign, of the principles
Involved and of the necessity of every
man doing his best to Becure \he triumph
of the Republican party. Prior to the in
troduction of Sir. Paterson, .thÂ«* Knicker-
bocker quartet enlivened the occasion.
. singing, a number of campaign songs- > â ;â .
: .".The arrival of Mr. Davis -was announced'
.. by loud and; prolonged cheering from the
street. : : He : : was â  escorted to. .the Pavilion ;
;. by the: Oakland, Phoenix and Union
]>. ; League : Republican . clubs. ; [These organ
izations : came . into the Pavilion headed; by:
their respective bands,, and each of them
; gave v cheers . for the ticket, Gaga and
â  Davis, in which the crowd lustily joined. :
: The entrance of Mr. Davis was the signal
: ;V for the wildest outburst of â  enthusiasm. .
When this had quieted, Mr. : Paterson,
â .'. arose and said j that he had the pleasure
;. of introducing to those present a distin
. guished member of the President's house
â /. hold,: a man who was bold and true Re
% publican as well as a gifted orator. He .
then besought those present who indorsed
â the- administration of President McKin- .
.: ley. to.give Mr. Davis .an attentive hear
.: irigV; The speaker of the evening ; then rose :
; .and stepped to the front of the piatform.
As he : did. so the crowd broke forth. Into
; ..an:b.utbiirst of cheers and applause that
"lasted for fully five minutes. When it had
'. subsided, Mr. Davis thanked those present
for his kind reception arid said: "â  .y '. :-â â¢ :

"â¢ "all. â â â  The Republicans will gain at ; least.
three members of Congress in this . State.
.They will also gain a Republican United
â 'â  States Senator in California. And when
â â¢- California has don* this, as she certainly
will do, she is entitled to take a seat: at

of â¢politics, believe in upholding the Presi
dent "or the United States, who has stood
by. them-. so loyally by day and by night,

tefesf.of this great republic and the glory
of the flag. . â¢â¢-..- â¢ . â 'â¢>â¢;"â¢
"During the last few months the war
with a foreign land has come and gone.
The guns of American vessels have been
heard on foreign seas, and the guns of
American free men have been heard In
foreign lands., and in places where. people
â¢were once ground under the heel of â  tyr
anny and oppression. To-day freedom
reigns supreme, and the flag of the. stars
and stripes waves in glory there, and it
stirs the breasts of liberty-loving people
like the morning stars of God, and . Its
' stripes are " beams of morning lightâ
this administration placed it there. (Ap
plause.) ''.....
'â â  "During the last few months the isl
ands known â as the Hawaiian Islands
â  have become a part and parcel of this
great republic, and the possession of
these Islands â even the possession of a
coaling station thereâ will be a greater
defense to this country than all the forti
fications you may erect or construct or
build upon the Pacific Coast. If any for
eign power owned .these islands, or owned
. a coaling station there, it would be a
â¢constant., menace to the peace of this
country and American commerce. To
uphold the ownership of these islands
and uphold the new possessions in the
.Pacific Ocean will later on enable us to
control absolutely the commerce of the
â  Pacific Ocean, which is destined to. be
the greatest commerce in â¢ the world.
Great problems lie outstretched before
: us and it will require a united country, a
united patriotism, united . courage and
united Intelligence on the part of the
American people to solve these great
â  problems as they must be solved in the
Interests of this country and in the inter
ests of our people. Now, my friends, the
only way to bring that about is to send
to Congress of the United States â to the
, Senate and to the House of Representa
tivesâmen who will not obstruct things,
â  who will not throw, obstacles in the way
of advancement, men . who will not tie
the hands of the President, but
who will on the contrary support
the President, v/ho will uphold â  him
In his efforts to carry on to a
solution these great problems; men who
will stand by him and stand by this great
country, men. who will stand by the flag
and by the people of this great nation.
The way to do this is- to send to Congress
such men as Mr. Loud and Sir. Kahn."
(Applause.), ' â¢ ' '-
Mr. Davis next scored the Democratic
and Populisjic members of Congress, who,
by their filibustering tactics, had at
tempted-.to oppose- every method advocat
ed by the President, and in this particular
he showed that the Democratic members
from this State were no exception. Upon
this portion of his subject he spoke as fol
lows: â  . /â¢ . â .
"My friends, the majority of the Demo
cratic and Populist . members of con
gress during the last year have not stood
i y the ndnUnstration; they, have not stood
by the President. of the United States. On
â¢ the contrary,- they have become obstruc
tionists and filibusters; they have opposed
almost every measure advocated by the
* President except the first one. They all
voted the 150,000,000 to . the President
â with which to carry on the war with
Spain. ' The patriotic Democrats and
the patriotic Populists would have comp
elled them -to do that; but after that
.measure had been' passed they became
obstructionists. They opposed almost
every single, solitary measure known as
a war measure that was advocated by
the PreKident oÂ£ the United States. Now.
I don't ask you.-to take my word for this,
my friends; all you have got to do is to
search the Congressional â search
- the Record and you- will find my state
ment Is absolutely trueâ they were
obstructionist's and filibusters, your
members of California; with but few ex
ceptions, were- among the obstructionists
and filibusters. . v Â
"When the time came to provide funds
wherewith to carry on the war, , and a
war revenue bill was under considera
tion, the Democratic party In the House
of .Representatives, with the exception of

HARMONY MUST

The Boss Denounced

LEES AND GUNST ROASTED
POLICE DEPABTMBNT IN THE
MUD OF POLITICS.
Spicy Meeting in Metropolitan Tem
ple â Legislative Candidates
Discuss the Issues of the
;â ..'â  Campaign.
The Democrats who assembled at
Metropolitan Temple last evening were
made aware, from the lips of their can
didates, that there is lack of harmony
in the ranks of their party. Eloquent
-speakers also made plain the fact that
such a condition is regretted; also that
an. effort is now being made to join to
gether in one fold the warring factions,
if such can be done over the head and
without recognizine the power that
rests. in the hands of Samuel Rainey.
Porter Ashe, Democratic candidate
for Senator from the Twenty-fourth
District* laid bare his wishes and it was
Whispered that to the v.orld he voiced
'the- sentiments of his colleagues. "I
understand that there are reports of
coalition between the warring factions
of -the Democratic party," said Mr.
Ashe, "and the news I welcome. I be
lieve all Democrats should stand to
gether In the Interest of our common
cause, that we may be better able to
cope with our opponents, but if in any
way or form Samuel Judas Rainey is
j acknowledged by those he has wronge-d
! I say here that they can't buy me, and
1 further announce that when I go to
the' Legislature I will be foremost
among those to advocate the forming
of.si.Lexow committee, the object of
which will be to see if that fat scoun
drel cannot be choked off in the body
polftic."
This denunciation of the great
Rainey was received with a howl of
approval, and a dog bearing a sign on
its back heraldin- the candidacy of the
speaker set up a bark and howl th;it
made the welkin ring. But Ashe had
others on his list of whom he wished to
/speakt so the crowd was stilled, the
! dog taken into the o--n and the speak
er continued. .. : .
"I find-that I am opposed by all that
is; bad and evil in the Republican party
and by the police department of this
j city, my servants. The corrupt in
> flu'en-ce of the police department is di
rected against me by one whose posi
tion is a disgrace .to the people of this
city, although it. was forced upon them
by' Governor M.arkham during the last
'.few hours of his reign. I am going to
! speak of Gunst and if he has a friend
j here I am glad, as I want him to go to
Gunst and tell him how high I esteem
him. When Gunst was appointed the
people were paralyzed. We all remem
ber the indignation meetings held in
this very hall and how the papers, Ir
respective of party, joined in demand
ing his resignation. His friends on
their knees begged a suspension of pub-
I lie opinion, begged the people to give
j him a chance to redeem himself, but
f what has he done? Thrown the police
i department into the mud and mire of
! politics, a thing to which Crowley, God
i bless him, would never have stooped. I
am opposed by Gunst. Why? He knows
when I go to the Senate it will be to
support the charter which will tear out
his political life from the roots. Then
that old fool Lees can be cast out
where he belongs."
M. F. Tarpey was chairman of the
â  meeting. He was presented by^ the
i temporary chairman and said: "The
Issues of this campaign, which Is rap
idly drawing to a close, have been gen
t erally discussed throughout the State,
! and it is now proposed to make San
Francisco the arena of battle until the
election is over." The speaker then
explained the object of the meeting,
I that of presenting the candidates for
legislative office to the people.
Frank J. Heany, John A. Wright and
James G. Booth followed in the order
named. Mr. Booth's address was short
and pointed. He said that he was go
ing to the Legislature for several pur
poses. He was going for the civic
: health of the city, not his own, to see
that the new charter was adopted, to
i see a good primary law enacted, to see
. that the poor children have free text
books in the public schools. Mr. Booth
was roundly cheered and retired.

'PATTdN WAS ABDUCTED.
Students Found Him and Demanded
â¢ â  ... a Half Hour's Speech.
: Cha-rles L. Patton got a reception arid
made a campaign speech last evening that
he had not : figured on,
.He was on his way to "another meet
ing" and was hurrying to catch a Third
street car, when he was taken by each
arm by a couple of strangers, who were
evidently much pleased at their capture.
The genial nominee for Mayor was in
the middle of an explanation: that he
wouldn't buy a gold brick if it was the
pure quill, when his escorts pushed him
through a door Into the presence of two
score of the students of the Students' Re
publican Club at 29 Hunt street.
It took him half an hour to tell his
new-found friends that if elected Mayor
he would try to do the right thing and
they sent him on his way with a rousing
assurance that they believed him.
Magnlre Talks to Veterans.
About ono hundred people attended a
meeting of the Democratic veterans of the
Civil War at Grand Central Hall last
evening. James G. Maguire. William A.
Craig and Joseph Leggett made the- cam
paign talk, assuring their hearers that
their hearts were full. of love for the old
soldiers. Mr. Craig promised if elected to
Congress from the Fifth District to vote
for liberal pension appropriations and to
always look after the interests and wel
fare of old soldiers. E. M. Galvin also ad
dressed the meeting, urging the voters to
cast' "their ballots for Judge Troutt for
Judge of the Superior Court and A. B.
TreadweU for Police Judge, both Repub

A Lively Meeting in
Odd Fellows' Hall.
AFFIRMATIONS AND DENIALS
PRESIDENT REYNOLDS SCORES
PHELAN'S JOB-CHASERS.
Attempt Made to Howl Down Ex-
Judge Murphy by Some Row
dies, but It Was Not
Successful.
Odd Fellows' Hall was crowded to the
doors last night at the meeting: of the In
dependent Municipal Club.
There was an unruly' element In the
meeting whose sympathies were with the
Democratic speakers. It broke out In
force when, after Dr. Clinton had vicious
ly attacked Assessor Siebe, Judge Mur
phy defended the Assessor. The Judge
was howled at, but he stood his ground
and, aided by the determined attitude of
the president, the rioters were subdued.
The president, Charles A. Reynolds, in
his Introductory remarks, said: "This is
not a piece club nor is it looking for any
political office. The Examiner has ad
mirably put before the citizens a piece
club known a3 the United Labor party,
and now an attempt is being made to put
in the position of a. piece club the com
mittee of 450, which has been offered by
the convention of one hundred one-third
of the patronage of this city and county.
Whether or not this committee of 450 is
for salÂ© will be determined to-morrow
night.
"I am not here to make a speech. Just
let me say that oar idea is that the peo
ple of this city and county are looking
for honest men because they have been
disappointed in party organizations and
conventions and mean to simply look In
the faces of the candidates to determine
whether there can be discerned honesty
or deceit. The club has taken upon itself
after due deliberation to recommend to
the people for the Judiciary men who are
known to be honest, have been tried and
found worthy. We recommend the elec
tion of Frank J. Murasky, Rhodes Bor
den, J. M. Seawell and J. M. Troutt."
President Reynolds in turn introduced
F. J Murasky and Rhodes Borden, who
briefly referred to their candidacy and
returned their thanks. The president
then read a letter from Judge Troutt re
gretting his inability to be present.;
Police Judge Low, Thomas F. Graham
and A- B. Treadwell, candidates for Po
lice Judge, were received with great ap
plause and delivered brief addresses.
Dr. Washington Dodge, aided by a long
pole and elaborate drawings, discussed
the assessment department and endeav
ored to show what a blessing to the citi
zens would result if he were elected As
sessor.
As the president introduced Frank H.
Kerrigan, candidate for Justice of the
Peaoe, he remarked that every Demo
crat in the city, himself among the num
ber, should vote for him. The candidate
blushingly stepped forward and expressed
his thanks.
Dr. C. A. Clinton, candidate for Super
visor, commenced by attacking Assessor
Siebe. He attempted to show that during
his term as Supervisor he had been in
strumental in carrying through all good
measures. In vehement language he said
that the remarks of the president to the
effect that Mayor Phelan had made a
dicker with a boss to give one-third of
the patronage of the city was absolutely
and unequivocally untrue.
Ex-Judge Murphy denounced Dr. Clin
ton's attack upon Assessor Siebe, whom
he characterized as an honest and capable
man.
Before Mayor Phelan spoke President
Reynolds read a letter from Charles L.
Patton that his other engagements would
not permit him to be present, which he
regretted as he desired to meet Mayor
Phelan on the same platform and ex
pected to have done so when he addressed
the club at Its last meeting. Three rous
ing cheers were given for Patton.
Mayor Phelan's friends cheered him as
he stepped forward. He denied that he
had mack or offered any compromise with
a boss.
The other speakers were Dr. Leland,
Joseph E. Barry. Judge Joachimsen,
Judge Conlan, Edwin Head. William Can
non, Benjamin Armer, Isidore Gutte and
John Lackmann. There were several
other candidates on the platform, but at
11 o'clock the president declared the meet-
Ing adjourned.
POTRERO HEARS PHELAN.
Scant Audience Turns Out to Greet
Democratic Nominees.
The usual audience did not greet the
Democratic nominees who last evening
addressed the voters of the Potrero.
Those who did turn out, however, were
enthusiastic and listened attentively to
the speakers.
Mayor Phelan was first to speak, and
upon a suggestion from the audience,
opened his speech with a strong, though
not fpecillc, denial of the charge that
he hau solicited the aid of Rainey and
the disaffected Democrats. He also denied
Bucklev and roasted both the bosses with
all the power of his excellent English. He
and his fellow Democrats, he said, would
go It alone in their fight for principle and
the people.
Recognizing that his audience was one
of hard working people he took occasion
to deny that he had recommended the
reduction of lamp lighters' salaries- from
$40. to $25, but he failed to reiterate his
statement that City Hall janitors were
paid too much for their work when they
were allowed to draw warrants for $75
a -month. ' . â¢ â¢â¢*â¢ '.' - '
He concluded his speech with an appeal
for a solid Democratic vote, that the
bosses and the corporations might be
tossed out of power for. all time to. come.
Following Mr. Phelan came F. K. Lane,
Washington Dodge, Frank J. Murasky,
W. G. Burke, James Denman and half a
dozen of the minor nominees, who made
nothing longer than the usual bow of first
acquaintance and plea for a solid vote.

SPOKE THEIR PIECES.
Voters of the Thirty-First Hear the
Democratic Candidates on
Local Issues.
An audience of 250 of the voters of the
Thirty-first District assembled last even-
Ing at the Grand Central Hotel. 530 Third
Street to hear the candidates on the Dem
ocratic State and municipal tickets. Not
many of the speakers turned up, John F.
Twigg tor the Senate, and William O.
Burke and T. F. Bonnet, representing the
local ticket, being the only ones to arrive.
Mr. Bonnet referred to his past record
as License Collector and promised an
equally honest administration of the af
fairs of the Sheriff's office should he be
elected. â¢
William G. Burke, Democratic candi
date for Police Judge, followed in a
eulogy of "Jimmy the Hefter." Mr.
Burko told the audience that his personal
election expenses would not go one cent
over $400, because he was a believer In
municipal purity and didn't beJieve in
handing: out cash to the boys to secure his
election. This statement was received
with a discouraging silence and several
audible gToans of dissatisfaction.
John F. Twigg, who aspires to the Sen
ate, dealt at some length with his inten
tions in case of his election.
Mr. Twlgg pledged his abilities to the
beÃt Interests of his constituents and
promised an honest sixty days in Sacra
mento. He was well received.
The Mayor and a number oi other local
nominees were expected, but to the disap
pointment of the audience did not arrive.
With Silken Banners.
The O. C. E. Club gave an entertain
ment and snow party in Union Square
Hall last night, at which there were a
number of handsome ladies and gallant
gentlemen and not a few candidates.
The feature of the evening was a grand
march led by twenty young ladies, all at
tired in white, and twenty gentlemen act-
Ing as their escorts, each carrying a
snow-white silken banner, each banner
bearing the name of a Republican candi
date. The banenr in the lend was the one
bearing on its face the name of Charles
L. Patton. The idea was something new
and was appreciated by the audience, as
was shown by the loud and frequent ap
plause. During the march the partici
pants were covered with imitation snow
showered upon them from the gallery
i ne affair was under the management of
William Ralph Elliot, president: Mrs.

GRACE IS ON THE SHELF.
I Supreme Court Declared the United
Labor Party Illegal.
The voters of this county will have dif
ficulty voting the United Labor party
ticket. This difficulty will arise from the
fact that there will be no United Labor
party named on the official ballot this
year, at least. Yesterday the Supreme
Court grave out this determination. The
Justices did not 'hand down any formal
findings, but Immediately after the argu
ment authorized Chief Justice Beatty to
state that the writ presented by W. P.
Grace through his attorney, W. H. Hart,
was denied, and that.- they would give, ex
planations later.. ; â¢â¢â¢â 
The members of the court, on account
of the voluminous character of the re
corded evidence, allowed the attorneys
to. argue from it without having cone
over it themselves. This was satisfactory,
as it had been compiled by Commissioner
Chipihan, and he had heard the testimony
of all parties concerned. Hart argued that
Registrar Biggy should have examined
: the entire registered list of- voters to as
certain if the names of the parties ap-.
pearing an the petitions were those of le
gal voters, whereas he had only consult
ed the registered lists of .the precinct
which corresponded to the addreaes
given on the petition.
â¢Garret McEnerney argued that the
United Labor party should be declared
a â  pretense oh any one of four grounds.
Principal among these were that it was
simply ah extortion scheme and not a
f>olltlcal party, and that it existed in vio
ation of the law of 1878, the purpose of
which was to suppress "piece" clubs and
prohibit the extortion of money from can
didates. The attorney declared that the
spurious organization had obtained
money under false pretei ;es, was con
trary to good morals and that the court
should suppress it regardless of techni
calities. The principal argument against
its existence perhaps was the evidence of
Biggy that there were not sufficient le
gal signatures to place it before the vot
ers. Commissioner Chlpman allowed
Grace to assume that nearly 50 per cent
of the names pronounced forgeries by
Biggy were correct and even with this
large margin the chief Btandard-bearer of
the "United Labor party" had to submit
to fate and have his party name stricken
from the official ballot.
Street Car Men Organize.
A permanent Republican club, com
posed exclusively of employes of the
Powell, Jackson and Sacramento
cable lines and Cliff motor line
was organized last evening at
1206 Mason street. Two hundred and
thirty members were enrolled. The indi
cations are that this will be the most
active political club that has been or
ganized by the street railway men of this
city. By a unanimous vote the club
agreed to stand by the Republican ticket
from top to bottom. The -pllowlng of
ficers were elected:
Harry L.. Wilson, Sacramento-street

them behind us in this fight we are

: M. F. Tarpey is a man of different
icaliber; If he does not want to answer
a question he says so and what he-says
may be relied on as the truth.
"You see," said he, "I was at that

' CHICAGO, "Obi.. 31.â A ' renewal 'of the recent '
war scare, together with an improved export '
demand, caused an advance in . wheat. After
an early "decline " December closed ; %c higher. â¢
The early information from foreign sources was
quite bearish and domestic receipts, co far as
known up to the time of the opening of the
wheat market, were sufficiently liberal , to be
a" good second to the foreign lead. . Under these
"conditions trading in December commenced
very weak and considerably below put price.
the market became exceedingly dull after the.
â¢ellmÂ£ary drop and kept sluggishly around
the opening price for over an hour. At the
end of that time a report was circulated that
English consols- had declined % per cent, and
that set the war feVer raging again for about
twenty - minutes, during which trade became
active and even somewhat excited. â¢ while the
price forged ahead until December showed a
gain of 1%'61 r >ic over the opening decline. The
advance did not hold, however,- as the amount
of the decline In consols was soon â¢ discovered
to have been exaggerated. The day's statistical
information was fairly well divided between
bullish and bearish. . Liverpool recovered nearly
all of Its early decline and New , York reported
five- boatloads taken for export, while 60,000
bushels were sold here for all-rail shipment to
the seaboard. " Thle resulted in renewed. buying
by shorts, . and . the market wound â¢up within
a- fraction of the high .point for the day. â¢â¢ â¢ â¢â 
â¢â  ' A decline at -. Liverpool ' and .good weather,
with the "weakness .in wheat, -started corn under
â  put-price",- -There- was. considerable buying
against those privileges,, which gave "the mar- ;

would â  have been lifeless,: -and ?i8 "it '.was- the â¢
fight over the 'termination of the rib deal af
fected so 'few 1 , people, that If dl.d not â¢â¢ produce
the usual excitement that attends a corner on
the-:' day of its climax. ' The longs in the â¢ rib
deal were houses- with English connection,
â  while' the shorts were said to be a' couple ot
Chicago's most prominent packers. The â¢result
of the 1 matter -was that ' October ribs', which 1
closed Saturday at $5 30, made the very sub- 1
stantial â¢ rise of tl 45 : and closed with a net
j gain of 95c. Private settlements on the deal
i during the session were said â to have . Â« been
made on 5,000.000 pounds. The rest of the mar
ket ruled dull throughout. Pork, and lard ad
vanced 2V4c on the day. â¢ .' .â¢ *'..â¢â¢â¢..

M. W. Dixon, a member -of. the Grand;
Jury that was recently discharged aiid
which presented a report notable for its
many references ;./ to incorrect claims
apainst the county, has played a joke on
liimself.. ' . '.' ' â¢ .
The Supervisors were surprised this
morning to receive m -letter .from Mr.
:>ixon, which said: "I hereby respect
fully request that you da not allow my
claim for $80 assigned to tha. Central
Bank and filed by me on July 25, 1? Q -
By its cashier, the Central Bank assent
ed to this agreement. It appears that air.
Dixon duplicated his bills for Grand Jury
services. On July 25 Mr. Dlxoh put in a.
bill against the county for $<n for' Grand;
Jury services during the manths of De
cember, .February, March., Aprii, May.
June and July. He assigned:. the claim -to
the Central Bank, after swearing to: it.
Kis signature Is attached, to the claim.
The bill against the county, was. O ivfd
by the county expert and is on record. .
Mr. Dfxon to-uay filed .a : second, bill,
dated October '3l, for services as -j-uryma-n
from December of last year tp Octpoer -i;
unoti 22.1 ft. It was also. assigned:
to the Central Bank. It iniclu.des ;â¢ the
f..rnv-r btil of |80, and t'.Tis faoti.v.as
brought before the Sup*rvisors this after-;
noon. The second bill beurs th> attesta
tior; of .^.rrectriess of . Foreman. .J.-E.
< n rooks. Mr. Dixon asked the board to.
,v the first bill, but thi-y have no..
%, wer to do this, and It/is prse n
l the second bill will be paid In fuji
incident has aroused mueh.eomm.-ent.. bey
cause the grand jurors expressed
pelves fully regarding the many errors;
made by those filing claims: against the
county. :; - . '.;-â 
The Board of Supervisors this morning
received; a communication from the Tail.-,
road company stating that the. rails .oil'
Alice-street bridjge. had been removed and.
that the t'ounty could use the bridge upon
condition that* it provided the ' neces-s-ary
bridge tenders and that ..the/- bridge.'; be
surrendercl to the company for removal .
within th-e time fi^ed by the Secretary of
War. The proposition was accepted-
POTRERO'S GREAT IMPOBTAIJCE.

Necessity.
The Potrero, or .tliat : portiori;bf the city \
Bouth of the >iiss.lQn Channei,' wfte're so .;
many branchfts of industry -are being/car- j
ried on, is about to be provided with- a ,

of late been found to be -atiything l>ut, "ax\-{
equate to -/accommodate ;the trafiftc that.
Is going bn ; between the two ends of the,
m-Jnicipality. In addition/to the increased j
travel over 1 the KeatuckyrStreet lme, the.,
I disadvantage of having a drawbridge
I through which vessels engaged in. the hay: :
>and lumber trade are compelled to .pass-;
and repass at the busiest hours .of â  the ,
day has caused the city authorities .to
provide other and better facilities for. the
Thousands of teams that go to and from
% : 'jtrero and South Sa.n Francisco
The heavy teaming done between the
Union Iron" Works, the' Western Sugar
Refinery the barrel works (wnere almost
all the barrels used Ln the iluur and sugar
business are made), the rope works, the
vinegar works and the bone works, all
eituated in the Potrero. and added to this
the traffic from Butchertown, has all to
be hauled along Kentucky street and
over the Fourth-street bridge. To avoid
B, portion of this crowded condition, a con
tract boa been let to the Potrero Land ana
Improvement Company to extend baxfn
street across the channel until tt connects
with Kentucky street at the railroad
crqsalng, near" the oil company's store-
ThVs road will be completed in about six
moiiths. The new roadway is more than
half finished, and when ready for use will
be one of the best streets in the city for
teaming, as the rock that is being dumped

END OF A WHALING CRUISE.
-.. The bjark Horatio arrived from the Okhotsk Sea yesterday. She left here in the early part of last No
vember and has had a very good season. Besides a cargo of sperm and whale oil she brought 4300 pounds of
bone, which in the present state of the market should bring $20,000. The Horatio will discharge at Howard

..Mrs. Hollocher. is suing on *v>Â« .â¢- ->unds
of cruelty, alleging that her husband has
threatened her life and on one occasion had
threatened to burn down the cleg-ant two
story Residence at 536 Eighteenth street.
That the defendant did not move for a
nonsuit In the face of the evidence ad
duced at to-day's trial was a surprise to
nearly every one in the courtroom. In
stead, the defense will proceed to Â«stab- I
lish its side to-morrow. The husband,
who was at one time a thrifty grocer
here, will probably testify in his own be
half.
"I think the world of my wife," said Mr.
Hfcllocher, "and I love her as affectionate
ly as the best huÂ»band could love a wile,
but I cannot stand the presence almost
constantly of a lot of gossiping women.
There are almxist always seven or eight
women at the house, and they get fed by
my wife, and I eimply refuse to pay. for
it. Some are spiritualists, some Presby
terians and others M-ethodfsts, and what
they do not get from Mrs. Hollocher she
gives to the church. Why, they would
arjve a man wild. and. of course, I would
swear; but could you blame me?
"That I ever struck my wife is not true,
and it's all of thefcr doing, this uivoree
business. We are interested in a $100,000
estate back :in Missouri . and rrcentlv I
put $300 in my wife's name. I s.aid: 'Now,
Hve. we>ll leave that in the hank and
when we get our share of the estate I
can go into business again.' But no; .in
just two weeks the t30() had vanished, ,and
some -church, no doubt, g it it.
"Why, one morning I cooTted my own
breakfast, and when at Yiight I returned
and there waa no supper I got out a half
loaf of bread, set it on the table and was
about to eat it for my meal when one of
these women came in and took it away
from" me. We have been married twenty
two years and have no children, and I
hope the Judge will not grant the divorce.
It's all these spiritualists' and religionists'
fault."

Trouble on the Steam Schooner Jewel
Over a Report That Her Boilers
Were Not. in Good
Condition.
"Bob" Spear, the boatman, had a nar
row escape last Sunday night. He had
been out to the cruiser Philadelphia, and
while sailing back to Clay-street wharf
his boat capsized. Luckily he managed to
get on the bottom of the overturned ooat,
and clung to It for over four hours. The
wind and tide carried him over toward
Goat Inland, and twice he was nearly run
down by ferry steamers. He yelled to tne
passing boats, but the noise of the paddle
wheels drowned his cries. Finally his
Whitehall drifted ashore on the south end
of Goat Island and as the bay was as
smooth as a mill pond he had no difficulty
irf righting her. After a rest, Bob secured
a warm drink from the lighthouse station,
borrowed a pair of oars from the keeper
and rowed bao"k to the city. He went J
home and changed his clothes, and at 6 j
a. m. was on his way out to the Philadel
phia again with a supply of meat and
bread for the sailors' mess.
The big steam collier Willamette is to
go into commission again this week. She
has been overhauled and has had new
boilers and engines put 'in, at a cost of
$105,000, and she will now be able to carry
nea*rly twice as much coal as before the
alterations were made. The engines of
the British tramp steamer Linlithgow,
that was wrecked on Coronado Island, '
have been put in the Willamette, and they
are expected to drive her ten knots an >
hour easily.
The owners of the Willamette are going
to overhaul and remodel either the City j
of Puebla or the State of California. The i
sum of $100,000 is to be expended, and me j
chances are that it wiil be spent on the
Puebla. That vessel is under charter to
the Government, and is now being got
ready for a voyage to Manila, On her
return she will go to the ' Union Iron
Works to be turned into a modern first
class passenger ship.
Another of the Okhotsk Sea whaling
fleet arrived yesterday. The old Horatio
brought in 4300 pounds of bone. 840 barrels
of sperm and 300 barrels of whale oil. She
left here last November, and has made a
good catch. It is estimated that the
whaling fleet .will put over a million and
a half of" money in circulation in San
Francisco this winter, which is a
showing for vessels that were given up
for lost nine months ago.
The old waiting rooms of the Sausalito
ferry are to be utilized by the ladies of
the Red Cross Society. The new ferry
depot was not a convenient place at
which to supply the soldiers with lunch,
so the ladies appealed to Assistant Chief
Wharfinger Scott for another location, i
They were shown the quarters vacated J
I
by the Sausallto ferry people, when the
new ferry depot was completed, and they
accepted them. The building at the foot
of Clay street will therefore be the head
quarters of the Red Cross when trans
ports are going away.
There was trouble on the steam schoon
er Jewel before she got away for Caspar.
and in consequence a new force <}f en
gineers sailed on her. The boilers of the
steam schooner are npt in the very best
condition, and the chief engineer so re
ported to the Inspectors of Hulls and
toilers.
This he is compelled to do by law, for
should anything happen every engineer
would lose his license. The Jewel was ex
amined and her steam 'pressure was cut
down to ninety pounds. The owners heard
that the reduction In steam power was
due to the engineers on the vessel and
they at once gave all those gentlemen
their walking tickets and put new men in
their places. The owners of the Jewel
know that their vessel wants new boilers
and a set has been completed and la
ready to be put in, but the time cannot be
spared to -do the work. It is probable
that the wssel will be laid up in a month
or so and overhauled.
The steamer Roanoke, which has been
running in the- Klondike trade, has gone,
to Oakland Creek to lay up.
W. Henderson, a ship carpenter, was
nearly killed on the bark Albert yester
ciav. He fell down the hold and dislocat
ed' three flnsrers of the left hand, broke
one of his ribs, dislocated his left knee
and tore lite scalp badly. He was treated
at the Harbor Receiving Hospital.
Dominic Roberts, the poultryman, had
a picnic yesterday. One of the bay schoon
ers brought him a consignment of three
bears from San Pablo. Two of them
weigh fully 400 pounds each, and the third
one a hundred pounds. The little one is
only a cub and is as playful as a kitten,
but the big fellows made an awful rum
pus when they -were being taken ashore.
One of them got his paw through the
bars of the cage and hit Dominic a crack
that sent him Into the hay. He was
nothing the worse for his dueling, but
took good care to fight shy of the bears'
cage after that.

amount to the. bank's assessment... .'.
The statement made in ?the Demo
cratic organ that there "was a detailed,
: statement on file with the Bank Com
: missioners at the time Assessor; Siebe
I asked ..for the. statements of. the various
! banks is absolutely untrue..: ; The sec ;
â¢ i retary.-of the Bank Commissioners can-
: not and will Dot deny this: ...Nor : 'will
he deny that in 1896 or any subsequent
. year, when application was ..-made- â  for
'- the statement filed with . the Commis
sioners by the German Savings'- and
â¢ Loan Society, that such statement dis
â  closed the possession of any other prop
:erty than that heretofore detailed. '. â¢ -
. - In the year 1897 this same bank made
; a statement to the Assessor, claiming
1 but $508,650 taxable property. On the
showing made by the bank's statement
â  filed with the Bank Commissioners. that
â  year their.- assessment was raised $775,
:: .000,' the amount they had loaned rout on
'â -'. stocks, bonds and warrants.': This same
: year (1897) the bank ' disclaimed the
: ownership of any ; municipal- bonds. In
â  1898 this same bank's assessment was
I raised fr0m: 5565,959. to $Â£$&ss% th.e .~dl.fr'

â¢: . â¢ The- '. conditions . and circumstances
connected ..with the assessment of the
- German Savings find Lpan : Society are
: of :. a similar character, to ..those
Â£ nected with ; : the assessment of -all â¢ the
. ' banks, Including -the: Humboldt iSavihgs
' arid Loan Society. ; 'i 'â '_â  " .'o -".'.". ;;â  . â â ; . â¢
.'- In every instance where : the = sworn
' statement of the bank showed ahy disf
crepancies between that and -the stater
.. ment filed with the Bank Commission
" ers, the bank's statement to the As
' sessor has been entirely disregarded
and the assessments have been raadeon
the statements made to the Bank Com
â ' missioners. In pursuing this course in
1896 the - assessments of the *, banks
'were ' â¢ increased â  $12,000,000 ' over , '-. the
amounts returned by the banks. in their
sworn statements made to the Assessor.
The increases in 1897 and 1898. were of
' nearly as large proportions.
â¢ It should be borne; in mind that the
short time allowed by law in ; mak
ing up the assessment roll does not al
low the Assessor to go into all the of
fices of banks, . corporation G or in
"; dividuals and expert their.books and
.ascertain if returns o of personal prop
erty have been correctly made. He
is compelled to rely : on irtdividnal
â statements. In the case of banks,
however, he realizes that as the Bank
Commissioners are charged with the
special duty of investigating these in
stitutions, they are the best source of
information necessary to make a just
assessment. In , every : Instance >. Mr.
Siebe has .taken advantage of every
particle .of Information that o these
Commissioners ' : have been ; able to fur
nish him at the date he was . compelled
by law to make the, assessments. - ;i
Whan the acts. of .the. Assessor are
. ' brought under criticism due considera
'â . tion is not given to 3 - the enormous task
â¢which the assessment of the property
of the city involves. The assessment
roll must, according to law, be made up
during the mon'hs of March, April,
May and June.
There is in round numbers $350,000,000
taxable property in the city and this is
divided among 100,0<>0 taxpayers. In
vestigations are made as thoroughly as
it Is possible to make them within the
appropriations made for that purpose
by the Hoard of Supervisors, and re
liance must be placed in a great meas
ure upon the statements of each indi
vidual taxpayer.
Where it is possible to discover dis
crepancies, as in the case of the banks,
Mr ' Siebe has availed himself of all
outside information obtainable, and
that such information has not been
! specific, detailed and complete was no
i fault of his. All unprejudiced and
fa.ir-mlnded people must admit that in
View of the foregoing statement of the
real facts in the case, the so-caned
'.'weighty .charges" are like other
charirea'that have been made against
Mr, Piebp from- the same sourceâ notn-
I ing but bubbles, and they will have no
Uyeisrht in influencing votes against that
1 m'Vdei; upright, honest and reliable of
frcial, Hnn. John D. Siebe.

Eastern Physicians Tear That the

Dr. M. H. Logan returned op- Saturday
-from the grand conclave of the Knights
Templar recently held in Pittsburg. He
highly commends the Pittsburg people
for their hospitality, and* says a number
of the members of the different com
manderies from California are making ex
tensive trips throughout the country and
Europe. The doctor himself visited
Mexico in the interest of the New York
Eclectic Society, and was commissioned
to select a location for a sanitarium 'in
which consumption could be treated. -A
spot in Northern Mexico is looked upon
with considerable favor by him, but he
will make another trip to the southern
country before submitting any report. The
treatment to be adopted, as soon as the
society gets" matters into shape. Is one de
duced from the views of leading physj
cians of the world, to which Dr. Logan
has contributed a large stock of informa
tion.
Physicians who have recently traveled
in Europe are apprehensive lest the black
plague should reach the United State*.
There is a grave possibility that it might
enter some of the Atlantic ports, and they
are alarmed tor the vast havoc it would
reap before it could be brought in check.'
The quarantine in Texas against yellow
fever is still maintained .in a rigid manner
by the officials, and several people were
taken from the train on which Dr. Logan
traveled. ' . ,

THE REV. FATHER YORKE DENOUNCES
CANDIDATES PHELAN AND MAGUIRE
Aims Ilie "Hefting" Major
Stands in the Forefront of
Bigotry and Intolerance.
80th Men Pronounced Moral Cow
ards, Afraid to Fight for Great
Principles for Fear of Los-
Ing a Few Votes,
The Rev. Peter C. Torke, chancellor of
the archdloc^pe of San Francisco, lec
tured last night for the last time In Cali
fornia prior to his departure for Europe
In quest of health. The eloquent priest
spoke In the great Exposition building in
Oakland for the benefit of the Church of
the Immaculate Conception, of which the
venerable Father King is pastor.
The lecturer was introduced by John
Lynch, who spoke of him as one dear to
the heart of every loyal Catholic and of
every lover of liberty. He prayed "thai
he might return Bafely, fortified to battle
for years to come among the people who
lovo him so dearly. The applause which
greeted Father Yorke was continued for
some time after he stepped forward.
He created a decided sensation among
his auditors by his arraignment of James
G. Magulre, Democratic candidate for
Governor, and of Mayor James IX Phelan,
candidate for re-election in this city.
In opening he reviewed the fight against
bigotry which had been carried oh during
the past five years. This, he said, was
not at an end, as bo long as men are men
the fight muÃt be maintained. He alluded
to the bonfires and promises of candidates
and satirized their promising everything
before election and forgetting after ; elec
tion. ''' : '.l'\ : : ' y â 
He laid down the principles on which
the fight was made: "First, we were hot
seeking privileges, only seeking equal
rights; second, never to trust any political
party, he had never favored any party
or candidate except as they stood for the
principle for which he is contending;
third, although this religious fight was
made against us rot to make religious
fight in return, and, lastly, we do not
respect persons. "We do not respect . rich
men more than poor. These are our
principles." :
Father Torke then went exhaustively
into his controversy with Dr. C. A. Clin
tin, the Supervisor, over the management
of the" Sailors' Home, which he said had
been a sectarian institution for forty
years. Regarding the part Mayor Phe
lan played In keeping it sectarian, ho
said: â  -;â ...;. ...'-. â 'â : .'â 'â > ..-â â 'â  â 'â . :
"He stands to-day before the people of :
San Francisco as approving the -acti'-tri
of the men who say that public moneys
shall go to sectarian uses. He stands
as the representative of the men who bay
that Catholics have no equal rights in
our puDiic institutions. He stands as the
apologist or me men who broke every
pledge, and the most sacrea pledge of
all, that of â  religious liberty; arid he
stands as their apologist, because; he is
a moral coward who is afraid of losing
votes."/.!: -.;:..;. "â â¢â .';! : ; ; \;. 'â¢â .â ;.â  ','';â â¢- '..;!: ':.'W-y.
"An effort was made to change the sec
tarian-character of the home. When
this matter was brought to. the, attention
of the Mayor, Mr. Phelan, he returned
the ordinance to.- the Supervisors, telling
them the laws should be : fulfilled; It was
passed again when they had fulfilled the
law by giving the proper, number ...of .' 'ad-:
vertlsements, : and again it caihe befpre
Mr. Phelan. Hij stated then that : th> ;
board had enough votes to â  pass- ft; pyer â 
his veto, and that, therefore, it would be â 
little use. for him to veto it. : -He stated
that he thought he could get some; con
cessions from this sectarian Board -if he :
signed the ordinance. I thought, then:. .'.as'
I think now, that half a loaf ia better,
than no bread, and when . Mr. Phelari
promised that the society would repeal its
by-laws regarding Protestant services
and that it would invite Catholic clergy
to come to the house on the same terms:
a.s the clergy of the other denominations/
I thought that such terms should be ac^
cepted, because there Was a chance that
Instead of getting even this meager con^
cession we might get nothing at all. So,
though the Mayor of the city signed the
ordinance, I have never thought it my
duty to call him to account fj>r It
"The friends of Dr. Clinton and the
other Supervisors have said that Mr.
Phelan was as guilty as they were, and
that I did not dare mention him because
he was a rich man. I did not mention his
name because I thought then he did the
best he could, and even IT iifte-rward he
has done wrong, and grievous and shame
ful wrong. I did not think that we, who
are flghtlnp In the cause of liberality,
should deny him the credit when he did
right. After the passing of the ordinance
and the signing thereof the. matter rested
until it chanced that I became ill and was
compelled to go under meclTcal treatment.

â  Our little daughter, now teen.months old,
was troubled from her birth with Eczema.
Her face, arms, hands, and neck would break
out with red pimples, the parts afflicted
would swell and become terribly inflamed,
water would ooze out like great beads of per-
spiration, finally this would. dry up and the
skin would crack and peel off. She suffered
terribly. Had to wear soft mittens on her
bands to keep her from scratching. We gave
two of our leading physicians a good trial,
but neither of them helped her in the least.
I purchased Cuticura Soap, CcnccxA(oint-
" ment), and Ccticura Resolvent, and com-
menced using them as follows: After bath-
ing I wiped her with a soft linen cloth, applied
Ccticura (ointment) freely, and gave her the .
Kebolvext regularly. She improved at once
and is now never troubled, although we hare
used less than one bottle of Resolvent, three
boxes of Salve," and of course Ccticura
Soap. The statements I have made are abso-

The REV. PETER C. YORKE, Valiant and
Eloquent Deferfder of the Catholic
Faith.
Then the chivalrous and brave 'Doctor
Politician' comes to the Board of Super
visors behind the petticoats of the women
who compose the society for the govern
ment of the Sailors' Home and in their
: name delivers an attack upon me and
upon my motives. Fortunately he kicked
me before I was dead. Fortunately other
people answered him in the papers, and
again and again I went over the ground,
showing the wrong he had done and chal
lenging him to explain his vote or to give
: any reason in the wide world that might
justify him; and though he wrote page
: after page and filled column after column,
all he could say was that I was a liar
and that he was perfectly right.
"Thus things went on until the time
came when the Democratic party of San.
Francisco, or that portion of it which is
composed of the Committee of One Hun
dred, began the task of nominating men
for office. I received- many messages from
Mr. Phelan in regard to these men who
had voted for turning over the Sailors'
Home to the sectarian institution, and
who besides had done more. It has al
w-ays been our principle in this fight not
only to oppose those who have taken the
oath of bigotry, but also to oppose those
who have been indorsed by the A. P. A.
This seems a hard and a stringent policy,
but it is a policy which was absolutely
necessary, because so long as a politician
could profit by A. P. A. votes so long
would there be an A. P> A. society to sell
its votes. Yet this Board of Supervisors
went so far when the city Treasurership
of San Francisco became Vacant to elect
thereto a man who took the A. P. A. in
dorsement when the A. P. A. had plenty
,bf votesâ one Christian Reis. who went j
before the people of San Francisco as
the nominee of that society that had
sworn to deprive Catholics .of their daily
bread. , V . : . '..-'Â»â '
"When the time came: that the com
mittee of one hundred was. to nominate
men for office, Mr. Phelan sent-, id. me
and; asked me what was my position cdri
'cernihg- these men.. : I Bald -to himâre
iniember I am doing a thing that : poli-
U-clanÃ hate; I am telling, you the- truth
4hd the whole truthâ l said; to him that
an attempt had; be>n made, to represent
this trouble: as. a personal quarre-1 be
tween Dr. Clinton and myself ;t)iat .Dr.
Clintoh's : friends had been .^circulating the
statement that I had no objection.; tp. him
: whatsoever, except that 'he had insulted
rrie. ... Ladies. â '"â¢ and gentlemen,;. Ivdo not
â think I. need tp\ answer the charge, that
there.- .is.an y politician of. the caliber of
Dr. ". Clinton â¢. f rojn whom' I. could receive
ah insult. (Applause,)' Yet,' Â£t the same
time,: as the effort was iiiade. to niake it
appear a personal quarrel; I was extreme
ly fearful, lest any one. should think, it
so ;â â  and .having laid It down among our,;
â flTst. principles that w-e. were not respec
ters of persons, I -would- consider myself
a betrayer of the sacred cause of liberty
if I should allow my personal feeliugs- to,
draw me into a quarrel with any man' a.nd
urge you to turn from any man simply
because of my personal sentiments.
'â '. "TJiis cause is too sacred for personality,
â¢and may my hand be withered and jny
â¢tongue -.cleave tor the -roof of my' mouth
if 1 would drag personality into a' -cause
where, are at stake : .the equal, rights of
my Catholic brethren. â  ("Great applause.)
I told him that so anifious was I tha-t this
thing should not be considered as a., per
sonal question- that if Dr. Clinton, as the
leader of these men, could give any kind
of an explanation why he voted for that
Sailors' Home management so- that I â 
might be Able to say that, if it was an
error of judgment it was not a betrayal
of our principles; if Dr. . Clinton Would
write any kind of an explanation at.a ll
that I could lay before the people and',

"I had to leave the city during the' time
the convention was going on] l>ut I left
word at the Monitor office that any kind I
of a letter at all that he might, send
should be printed and .put before the peo
ple â so anxious was I- to' end- this coh.tFO
versv, and to set him right with his own
people.. Dr. Clinton refused to give any
explanation of his Vote. .Dr.- Clinton' dl.d
not- dare to tell the reason -why he had
voted to turn 'over- municipal "property to
a, sectarian institution. -.. â¢ â¢ . â¢
"In! regard to' his protestations of in
dependen-ce, Dr. Clinton bears the sajne
relation to J. F. English that Delany, for
instance, bears to . Hainey. J. .F. English
made Dr. Clinton 'and put him in politics,
ana Dr. Clinton worships .his maker:- J.-
F. English is in' the commission business
and sells potatoes and onions and such
things. Vp to a few months ago-^-thla
voting that I have spoken of took' place '
in the summertime â and on ihe Ist .of
September I learned from Larzalere &â¢
Co. of 320 Davis street that up to a few
months before that time they had- sup
plied potatoes and onions .to the Sailors'
Home. At that date the superintendent
of the Sailors' Home began to drive up to
the warehouse of Dr. â Clintori'-s friend and
get his onions and his potatoes for. the
institution. (Laughter and applause.).
"Of course, one good turn deserves an
other, and it is an instructive and edifying
fact- that the vote of Dr. Clinton should
be rewarded by patronage for Dr. Clin
ton's friend. And so the honorable 'Po
tato' Clinton (laughter) was not able to
give a reason why he had voted to turn
over the Sailors' Home to a sectarian
society, but preferred to remain silent in
the absence of any reason."
"It was- stated to the Committee of One
Hundred and to Mr. Phelan, who was the
mainspring of the committee and nomi
nated the members thereof, with the ex
ception of one or two, that in the absence
of a satisfactory explanation the members
whom they were honoring were in pre
cisely the same position as the A. P. A.
They had by their votes taken the stand
that Catholics in San Francisco did not
have equal rights with non-Catholics. |
They had taken the stand that public
property should be turned 'over to sec
tarian uses, and they had taken that
stand with such a vigorous and such de
termination that they would not conde
scend to ever Inform the people why they
had taken it. It was told him then that |
by nominating these men he was approv
ing of their action in the matter of the
Sailors' Home, and that he was taking
the side of "the bigots who had fought him j
two years ago and that he was betraying
the men and the women who had made
many a sacrifice to put him in the chair
where he then sat. What was Mr. Phe
lan's answer?
"What was the answer of the man who j
was rich enough not to fear any poli
tician?
"What was the answer of the man who
had gone into office on the flood tide of
liberality?
"What was the answer of the mSLO. Â©t
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1898.
whom we might have expected, from his
name and race, he would stand for every
thing that was good ana liberal and
noble?
"His answer was that he could not af
ford to turn down these men for having
voted against this principle, for fear he
might lose votes, and so he put them on
his ticket. So, to seal his infamy, he went
down to the city front to take up an in
dorsee of the A. P. A., one Stewart
Menzies, In defiance of the liberal
sentiment of San Francisco, in
defiance of the people who had
stood by him and who had elected him.
Mr. Phelan stands to-day in the fore
front of the ranks of bigotry and in
tolerance.
"Mr. James G. Maguire (applause).
Just wait! (Laughter.; Mr. James G. Ma.
gulre holds a peculiar position before the
people of San Francisco and before tho peo
ple of California. He is engaged now in
a canvass for the position or Governor of
this State. Some years ago Mr. Magulre,
when he was a Judge on the Superior
bench, bo far forgot his Judicial Impar
tiality as to descend into Uie arena of re
ligious controversy. He wrote a book
entitled 'The Pope and Ireland,' In which
If he did not show knowledge of the sub
ject, he showed at least a virulence that
is popularly credited to those who are
renegades from their mother's faith and
turncoats to their father's principles and
S^ople. Still, ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
laeuire's opinions are his own; and if he j
wishes to write a book, no' matter on
What subject, in a country In which we
are guaranteed liberty of speech and free
dom of rellgton, he has full liberty to
do so. ..â â â¢'â¢:
"I have, never spoken against the A. P.
A.'s because they were Protestants or be
cause they were opposed to the Pope. I
have spoken against them, because they
deny eoual rights to me and mine; -.There
fore, when the cry went but in 1894 that
Mr. Maguire was an A. P. ' A. I did not
think : that the mere fact that he dif
fered-.from me In. my: opinion about our
Holy ; Fa-ther was sufficient for me to con
demn h-lrn. â¢ I investigated the matter
and- found-that it was a campaign lie and
took action publicly arid authoritatively, to
contradict it. On the eve of the election ]
day of 1894 I remained up all night, per- |
sonajly sending out circulars contradict- i
ing this report, because' l d4d not believe ',
that liberality demands injustice in a
â¢champion;- 1' do not think that because' a j
man differs from me In belief therefore. j
â I should oppose him In politics. : : For-this,;
ladies and gentlemen, 'I. asked.-no- thanks
arid I expected no gratitude; But one
:,thlng I did expect, â  one thing'- I had a
right- to look fo-r,and that was that, after
pledging my wordier -him, Mr. James G.-
Magufre would not make a liar of me by
going- over and doing the very thing for
which the A. P. A.!s were opposed.
"When he began to run for Governor
this y*ar it became necessary for him to
appoint his campaign committee. That
campaign committee is his .cabinet. They
are appointed personally by him. With
them he consults,, and they manage his
fight. Mr. James G. Maguire, in looking
among the citizens of San- Francisco for
good Democrats to help in his campaign
thought he could not choose any one-bet
ter than this same Dr. C. A. Clinton,
â who had by hts vote declared that Catho
lics were, not entitled to equal rights In
their own city. After he put him on his
campaign committee he began to see the
consequences of what he had done, and
to realize that his aotion was an approval
of a most bigoted vote and course.
'.'Nor at my request, but of his own
'.volition, accompanied by .my friend, Mr.
James H. : Barry of the Star, t a Democrat,
â¢*.n(l Mr. EdwaTd Donnelly of San Fran
ciscd, : a Republican, he came to my office
to explain his action. He told me that
when Dr. Clinton was put on the cam
paign committee he knew nothing of his
action in the matter of which j have
.spoken. He acknowledged himself, when
I tiad placed tho facts and figures 'before
him, that he o.wed it to himself to re
pudiate the suggestion which Kis action
in putting him on- the campaign commit
tee conveyed â tha.t he was " 'Indorsing
bigotry. He saw as clearly as you see,
â and as clearly as I see, that putting him
in that position was an approval of his
vote.- â¢. , .
. "After" the matter had. been called in
question in .this way, and without any
request from me â because I ask- nothing
â ot a politician (applause), Mr. James G.
Maguire said: 'I must take him' off this
list,' and he pledged his word = to do so.
He left that roem with that pledge.
James G. Maguire, who speaks bo much
of American liberty and liberality, found
or fearea that he would lose votes If he
took Dr. Clinton's name off, and, being
affaid of losing- votes, Clinton's name to
this moment r.emalns upon his campaign
committee, as a testimony that James G.
Maguire dare no.t live up to his principles.
(Applause.) - ' .
â  ".Ladles and" gentlemen, I anr afccused
now, when 'l speak of these things,, of
interfering in politics and of clerical dic
tation. When the committee of one hun
dred waa told of the action of these three
men the political purists, like Gavin Mc-
Nab and Sammy Braunhart and Max
Popper and the rest of them declared that
they would not be ridden by any priest.
They declared that priests had no busi
ness interfering in politics. I should like
td know if my citizenship is not as broad
and as high and as deep as the citizen
ship of Gavin McNab or Sammy Braun
hart or Max Popper. (Great applause.)
. "I should like to know who gave that
committee Mayor Phelan and Gavin Mc-
Nab and Max Popper and Sammy Braun
hart and the collection of little saloon
keepers, with the beer dripping from their
beards, that they have gathered together
âwho gave them the right to prejudice
by one jot or tittle the citizenship thar the
State of California had given to me?
(Renewed applause.) Ladies and gentle
men, I have not interfered in politics. I
have asked them for nothing. I have de
manded no nominations from them. I
am not a cent richer for all of them that
are in politics.
"A few days ago, when it became neces
sary for me to go away, I had made so
much out of politics that a few of my
friends had to subscribe money so that I
may be able to seek health and rest in I
foreign parts. lam not interfering in
politics, but I have the right, given to !
me by my citizenship, and by the fight
you have made, to demand that that fight
be kept on to the end, and that not for
the convenience of Mr. Phelan or the
committee of one hundred shall bigots be
placed in office unopposed. (Applause.)
"80, In the iamo way* Z have never
taken up the cry against James G. Ma
! quire because he wrote a book upon Ire
land : and the â  Pope. Mr. "James G. Ma-
I quire is :at perfect <â  liberty "in * his book , to
; express i his , preference " for the Vicar of
[ Hell over Vicar of Christ. Mr. James
1 G.Alagui re knows his own friends best.
i (Laughter and applause.) . Mr. James G.
I Maguire ' may have ;so far forgotten . the
Judicial. impartiality that belonged to his
| station ;as ,to step down from the bench
and gather up all the calumnies of the
I supers and the jumpers and the libel
mongers against Ireland and the Pope.
He may have forgotten that neither he
! nor. any. man of his name or race could
haVe sat in the position which he occu
i pied were it not for the self-sacrifice of
irish Catholics. * S& . -.
"Mr. James G. Maguire may have been
forgetful of the very nand that helped
' him in his time of need. He was â¢ fed
by the Jesuits when as yet he \ was a
stranger in San Francisco and knew not
how profitable gratitude might be-*
come. He betrayed the party that first
gave him preferment; turned his light
affections to another faction, again
changed his coat the third time and the
fourth time came back to a party for the
sake of office. These matters are beyond
my comprehension..
"But one thing I will speak about, and I
have a right to speak about, and that is,
when religious liberty was imperiled Â«-in
this community Mr. James G. Maguire
was dumb. When bigotry was rampant in
the halls of 'Congress in Washington Mr.
James G. . : Maguire's' voice : was ; never
raised in opposition to it. . When your Dr.
Dille was able about the 3d of July, 1899,
to claim; Mr. Maguire as the Catholic
champion of A. P. A. -ism on this coast
Mr. James G. Maguire never thought it*
worth his while to put in a disclaimer.
Is ever once, by word or deed, would he
put himself on the same side as the people
from whom he sprung, and who since he
was able to walk have put' the bread in
his able to and have put the bread in
stomach and the clothes upon his
back. (Applause.)
"Mr. Maguire Is now lifting up his voice
against his opponent on the Republican
ticket as a man who is tied down to cor
porations and who dared not call his soul
his own. Would you who remember my
course consider that I am a friend of cor
porations or that I am afraid of them?
When in 1894 and .1896 Mr. James G. ma
guire was shouting as loudly as now that
corporations were fighting him on the
railroad* issue and on the religious issue
I came out In his favor and t6ok part in
the contest in his behalf.
"When, two years ago, a great trust
was behind the A. P. A.'s in San Fran
cisco, I was able; to fight them, and the
people of San Francisco were able to beat
them. I believe that when a corpora
tion is an opponent of religious liberty
that â we should fight the corporation. I
do not believe, and you do not believe,
and no man of liberal tendencies believes
that we should betray religious liberty
for the sake of beating a corporation.
There are things higher than politics-
There are things higher than mere suc
cess, and one of these things Is religious
freedom.
"I do not care if Gage were tied down
to ten thousand corporations. I know
this: Four years ago in Los Angeles he
stood on the floor of the Republican con
vention when that convention was con
trolled by A. P. A.'s, and when a bigot
resolution was brought in there he stood
Up like a man and opposed it. ' (Great
applause). He was hooted off the floor by
the beetle-browed and left their com
pany a man and a hero. (Great applause).
â¢'"When- the same question came before
Mr. James G. Maguire he shuffled and he
evaded it, and he stood on one foot, and
stood on the other foot (laughter) and
tried to dodge, and he tried to shift* At
the end, when it was put to him so clearly
that he could not any longer do either, he
responded by taking his stand with Dr.
Clinton, who is the exnonent of the idea,
by his vote, that Catholics are not entitled
to equal rights. (Great applause). ' ; . â¢â¢ â¢â â¢
â  "I do not ' believe in bringing religion
into any political fight. I do not believe
in fighting a man because he wrote a book
.in which he expressed his opinions and
they happened to differ from mine. But
I do believe in fighting every man and in
fighting every party that Bays that I and
my fellow-Catholics 1 have not as much
right in this country as men any other
.denomination. , (Great . applause.)
Â,"I-Â°r eflect upon the fact' that Jailbird
Price, who since his liberation -.from San
Queritin has been running an official A. P.
A. paper, is hot for Maguire; I reflect
upon the fact that every A.. P. A.- from
Sisklyou to â¢ San Diego, "who .recalls his
denunciation agajnstthem is' out against
Gage. I reflect 'upon .these ' facts, ; and I
cannot and will , not believe' that the
people of California who two years "ago
fought and won. the battle for religious
freedom will forget that when' this is
sue was â¢ put â  before ; James G. Maguire
James G. Maguire took the; side of the
man who said that Catholics had not as
much rights as other men. Ah! James G.
Maguire, '-- false to your mother's' creed;
false to your father's people, . you needed
but this crowning- Infamy that you should
be false to your own plighted word! ,
â  "Now, ladies and - gentlemen, I have
tried- to do that of -which politicians, are
greatly, afraid, and. that is to tell you' the
truth; the whole truth and nothing b.ut
the truth. * I would not change' a syllable
of what' I have said, because. I believe
that you, who fought and w.ho sacrificed for
religious liberty, -should not be fooled. by a

may avoid being fooled is by 'your know-

You are the people who will-gain or Who

KANE SEEKS
TO DRIVE OUT
THE INMATES
Determined to Close
Bacon Place.
FORMAL NOTICE SERVED
THE WOMEN GIVEN FOBTT
EIGHT HOURS TO VACATE.
An Effort to Be Made to Have the
Board of Supervisors Declare
the Alley a Nuis
ance.
Secretary Kane of the Society for the
Suppression of Vice last night served no
tices on the inmates of the disreputable
houses on Bacon place, as well as the
owners of the premises, ordering them to
vacate within forty-eight hours. Kane
personally served the notices. He was
accompanied by several of his deputies,
who were prepared to defend him against
a possible attack.
The greatest consternation reigned when
Kane and his deputies walked through
the alley and proceeded to serve tne
women with the formal notice to vacate.
They lost no time in notifying the owners,
of the numerous houses, who quickly re
paired to the scene.
They held a sort of an lndigatlon meet
ing and resolved to face Kane with a view
to ascertaining the cause of his action.
Kane explained that he considered Ba
con place a menace to public morals and
decided to close it. Notwithstanding the
protests of the owners, Kane continued
serving the women inmates with the no
tices to vacate. !â 
Evidently thinking that Kane intended
to arrest them after he had served them
with the written notice, -many of the
women left the houses without waiting to
pack their effects.
The notice is written on the printed
blanks of the "Pacific Coast Society for
the Suppression of Vice." and is signed
by Kane. After declaring that the street
is a "menace to public morals," the in
mates are warned to vacate under pen
alty of being arrested and sent to prison.
The owners of the houses on the street
are seriously considering the advisability
of appealing to the courts to prevent
Kane from further interfering. To a re
porter one. of them said: "It seems that
Kane is still sore over the roasting he
received from Chief L,ees, and in order to
get even with him he boldly usurps the
power of the Police Department and at- 1
tempts to drive the women out of Bacon :
place, ...,.:
"Since he was denounced by the head of
the Police Department it was whispered
that he would attempt to close the alley,
I concluded that he was talking to his
hat, so to speak, and paid no attention i
to his alleged threat. To my surprise I
learned that he meant business,, and was ;
determined to compel the women to va
cate. â¢ ./. .--â¢.'â¢ â 'â 
"Just why Kane, should attempt to in
jure the. property-owners on Bacon place'
because he had a dispute with the Chief of
Police seems strange,, to say the least.
Prior to the trouble between them Kane
offered no objections, to the presence of.
the women. â¢'â â¢..
"In order, to shut put their shame we
went- to the expense of erecting gatesi'.sd
that .there would be no objection.- Af
ter we have- done everything to avoid pub
lic interference, Kane, evidently to .make
a record for himself, and incidentally to
throw discredit on the police -department, '
appears on. the scene and. orders the
houses closed:- â "' â¢-.-â  â¢' -.- : - ' ;...â¢â¢'â¢. â¢ '-.'
"THe police' have succeeded In closing :
Morton and Berry streets'.. but I. seriously
doubt whether Kane has: the: powers to
compel the -Inmates' of Bacon -pikce' to'
vacate. However, :~we 3d riot intend to;
abandon hope until the highest courts in
the land have, decided- against us.'* . :

will appear before the Supervisors -and

A Girl's Neckties. ' : \
A little while ago the only way a girl
could get a pretty tie was to buy ribbon
and make It or borrow her brother's.
That's changed now. She goes to a
men's furnishing goods store, selects
her scarf or golf stock, collars, cuffs
and dress-suit case just as a man does.
The modern haherdasher caters to my
ladies' wants as he does to those of the
sterner sex.
The demand for furnishing goods for
both sexes has compelled Messrs. Roos
Bros, to annex the stare adjoining on
the south, No. 25 Kearny. They have
fitted it in oak, plate glass, nickel and
wrought iron an*' filled it with all the
foibles of the day in haberdashery for
man and woman.
An arched way leads into the' former
furnishing goods store and another into
the main store, where ladies" hats are
sold as well ac men's.
