October 14. Owing to the clOFe of

fifty buildings, were burned. Fear, |

piled his bow across a violin, but when
the wind was highest and the fire
fiercest there were reeling orators and
drunken perorations to the flames. A

Police bugle calls sounded a fire
alarm on the frosty air at Dawson at
5:20 o'clock on the morning of October
14. Half-dressed mounted police, -sol
diers of artillery and infantry and cit
izens rushed to the Green Tree Hotel
and saloon on Front street, next to the
postoffice, from the upper story win
dows of which flames were leaping
forth and licking the eves. A llprht
wind, steadily Increasing in volume,
was blowing down the river to the
north. Densely built Front street
poured its population out of doors and
windows In various degrees of dress. In
twenty minutes the postofflce building
The San Francisco Call
was afire. Willing hands tumbled let
ters Into sacks and carried them away.
Ten minutes from the moment it took
fire the postofnee was falling in pieces.
So rapidly did the fire spread that it
then became apparent . that Dawson
was doomed unless a miracle intervened
to save it. However, citizens and sol
diers set their teeth and went to work
to do what they could. The crowd
seemed panic-stricken and rooted to the
spot
Second-hand dealers and other store
keepers who had buckets feared to loan
them. Desperate methods were re
sorted to. The determined few drew
revolvers on the nearest merchant and
forced him to give up the buckets he
had. After that there were no more re
fusals, tfhree lines of men were formed
to the river and soon all descriptions
of vessels that would hold water were
passing swiftly up one line full and
down the other empty.
Men mounted roofs and poured water
on the fire till their smoking clothes
scorched the flesh and their faces were
blistered. There were some deeds of
heroism. One man remained at his
post till his eyebrows were singed; an
other fled only when his hair was
ablaze.
Urged by the wind the roaring flames
reached out their arms and encircled
the fine new Worden Hotel building.
All this happened so quickly that only
a few armfuls of valuables had been
carried out. From this building the
fire spread up the street and down the
street and leaped across Paradise alley
toward Second street, upon the numer
ous cabins occupied by women of the
j town In leas than an hour over forty
buildings in four blocks were burning
at the same time. The whole block be
tween First and Second streets and
First and (Second avenues was a seeth
ing furnace, the flames being sucked
inward. "Wagons and carts rushed
hither and thither taking goods to safe
places. The thousands of buckets of
water passed rapidly along the lines
made no more holes in the flre than a
handful of shot cast iixto a river. There
was a sputter and the holes disap
peared.
Across Front street Jumped the flre
and almost at the same instant the
shacks. and shell-like buildings on the
water front joined the general com
bustion. This Is a part of the long
section of water front which Alexander
McDonald leases from the Government
officials for $12,000 a month. McDonald
is generally credited with making a
monthly clean-up of from $12,000 to
$1,5.000 in rents. The rent roll of the
Klondike king will not now be so large
for a while.
Meanwhile a number of water pass
ers in the lines up from the river fell
exhausted where they stood. Others
immediately stepped up to take their
places. Many men on the wide fringe
of ice down at the river were frozen
to their tracks by the water splashed
and dropped on their feet from the
buckets. The situation became some
what ludicrous when they had to be
chopped out of the ice. Whisky was
finely passed along the line to revive
th^ drooping spirits of the workers, for
sti'l the flames rolled on higher and
higher, and wider and wider grew the
blat kened track. Casks of liquor were
roll> d into the street and the heads
knocked In. Others beside the flre
workers got hold of the tin cups and
so guzzled themselves that the number
of dr inken men and a few of the low
est class of women could be counted
by twos and threes. In addition to
these were the usual large number of
males and females, who, routed out at
the eaily hour, had not slept off the
night's debauch. Some, still drunk,
had not gone to bed at all. These peo
ple got in the way of the flre fighters,
in the way of those who were trying
to save their property, laughed and
joked at the flames and made a most
shameles.' spectacle in the full glare of
the calamity which was sweeping over
the city.
It became evident by this time to the
flre fighters that the only way Daw
son mirht be saved was by tearing
down and blowing up buildings In the

RICH PLACER DEPOSIT
FOUND BY PROSPECTORS
ON PORCUPINE CREEK
Fortunate Discoverers of tJ)e Pay Dirt Exhibit in
Juneau PicKJe Bottles pilled With Coarse
Gold ar)d Small Nuggets.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Nov. 10 (by steamship Cottage Cit- to Seattle, Nov. 14).â Verily, the-c don't know yet
what they've got In Alaska. Another placer deposit has been found, richer than the wildest dreams of the
humble prospector vho staked the Discovery. It is on Porcupine Creek, about thirty-five miles up the Chil
kat trail from Haines Mission. The mission, as it is called, in these parts, is on Lynn canal, between Juneau
and Skaguay. Reports of strikes have been eomin~ out o* that section all summer, but they proved unfound
ed upon investigation. The last one received as little credence as its predecessors until yesterday, when S.
W. Mix and Ed Finley came down to Juneau on a small steamer and exhibited in pickle bottles of large size
an amount of coarse gold and small nuggets ranging in size from small shot to lima beans, t v ' astonished
the town. Atlin was for the time being forgotten and the new strike is the talk of all Juneau.
Mr. Mix is a man of <-nir!dle age, and an old California miner. He lived at Shasta, and his parents and
wife now are there, or at Walla Walla, Wash., he does not know which. He has been in the interior prospect
ing for five m "is and unable to communicate with them all that time. He and Finley are partners and the
discoverers of the diggings. Mix is at the Circle City Hotel. He said:
"We went into that country last June and have since been prospecting in the mountains and among the
creeks back of the mission. Ido not know how long a stream Porcupine is, for we did not po to its head.
When we found the gold we stayed right there. This was about three weeks ago. When we had staked out
claims for ourselves we sent word back to the mission and Pyramid Harbor and let our friends in on it.
"We have taken out about $2000 in dust. The last day we worked we cleaned up $165 out of a twelve
foot sluice box. Finley and myself and another man have pooled out thvee claims and will work them to
gether next summer. lam satisfied that I have a '-nod thing and don't want to sell. We were driven out
by the snow. It has fallen there to a depth of over four feet a week and we could not work. One man re
mains on our claims during the winter."
Mr. Mix said they would not take $200,000 for their three claims. The dust is the cleanest and purest yet
found in Alaska or the British Northwest Territory. It outranks Dawson gold in that respect. Forty claims
in all have been staked and recorded in the Porcupine district. The records are in Juneau.
A small creek which has been named McKinley, a tributary of Porcupine, has been found almost as rich
In gold. Edward Haeckley, a miner, formerly of Mendocino, Cal., is its discoverer. He took out a $13 25 nug
get, the largest one yet found in the district. Lewis of Los Angeles, Cal., got in on the find early. He went
south about ten days ago from Skaguay with about $1000 he had taken out of his ground, Â«nd is now said to be
in Los Angeles. In fact, the discoverers seem to be almost entirely a California aggregation.
Porcupine Creek empties into ihe Klahena River, which in turn flows into the Chilkat River, which dis
charges its waters into Pyramid Harbor. The trail to the diggings is the Dalton trail to the mouth of the
Klahena. It is a mile and a half across the peninsula from the mission to Pyramid Harbor. The Chilkats,
the gamest, finest looking and most Intelligent Indians in Alaska, have several villages on Pyramid Harbor and
up the river a short distance. It was a Chilkat who shot at "Jack" Dalton last summer and nearly killed him.
About all the ground on Porcupine and McKinley creeks has been taken up, but Mix says there are other
creeks in that section which he intended to prospect if he had not struck it on Porcupine. He went to bed
rock for the gold he took out. Another creek was explored near McKinley. Nothing but galena rock, car
rying silver, was found on it, and for this reason it was named Bryan Creek. The miners give it the go-by.
These new diggings are on American soil, the first of any consequence that have been discovered in Ameri
can territory since Gold Creek, back of Juneau, was worked out some years ago. The claims are, therefor. 1 ,
ISONsby 600 feet in dimensions, instead of 250 and 100 in British Northwest Territory and British Columbia, in
whicJYi Dawson and Atlin are, respectively, located. It has been freely predicted for a year or more that placer
mines would be found in American territory that might rival the Klondike creeks, and apparently here they
are, though, as a mntter of fact, it is yet too soon for any one to say Just how rich they are. A better idea
of the amount of gold will be had at the end of next summer. Cabins will be built this winter at Porcupine
by people intending to open stores and saloons next spring. Sixty days after the water begins to run there will
without dosjbt be a lively and good sized camp at or in the Immediate vicinity of Porcupine.
The Cdttage City to-night brought down over $30,000 in gold, about $2000 of which belongs to A. S. Smith
of Kent, Wa*h., who made that sum by taking in a large band of cattle to Dawson. Prominent and well
known Dawsonites on the ship are William McPhee, William Thompson, George Zoe and a man named Sonny,
a miner who has a grip heavy with gold dust.

men were at this came of checkmate.
Many, at first reluctant to purpose

with so much labor and expense, stood
by without showing any disposition to
engage in the work. The police made
a bluff.
"Lend a hand there or I'll take you
in."
"Fall into line there, you."
There was a scramble to obey. Ropes
were made fast to cornices, corners and
roofs, and with a long pull, a strong
pull, a pull altogether buildings came
down like houses of cards.
Dynamite and giant powder made
quick work of those which could not be
easily razed with rope or axes. Caches
were overturned and crushed, frame

to splinters. Buildings on all sides
were charred or scorched, where not

together, steaming, not in the sun, but
in the heat of a red catastrophe.
Fire apparatus, comprising one Ah
rens and two chemical engines, had
arrived in Dawson some weeks before.
It remained unpaid for and undelivered,
lying on the ground in front of the
North American Trading and Trans
portation Company's store. The chemi
cals were packed so that they could be
quickly put together, but they had lit
tle or no effect on the raging flames. It

and powerful machine. The boxing was

setting them up appeared as by magic.
They, were soon hard at work getting
the Ahrens into commission. This work
was done by Charles Bush, for ten
years a fireman and assistant chief of
the Victoria Fire Department; "Jack"
Sears, formerly a member of the Seattle
Fire Department; T. J. Lane, formerly
of San Francisco: William Kerr and
Lon Griffin, all old firemen.
At about 9 o'clock, or four hours after
the flre started, the engine was set up,
showing 120 pounds of steam. What a
sight for sore eyes, half blinded by heat
and smoke, for trembling property
owners, for the assembled multitudes,
vaa that engine as It came rushing;
down the street toward the river.
What a cheer went up. How hearts
were gladdened, as one coming: upon
a cool brook in the desert is made glad.
The lines of water passers dropped
their buckets and cheered, too. It was
salvation for Dawson, salvation on
wheels. Long lines of hose were quickly
stretched. Cheer after cheer greeted
the appearance of the first stream of
water aa it shot from the nozzle, curv
ing as a rainbow of promise and fell
like a punishing flail on the fire. Where
that saving stream touched it left a
trail of black ashes behind.
Just then, too, wonderful to relate,
the breath of heaven changed. Carth
age was destroyed, but the gods showed
favor to the new city of the land of
gold. The wind wheeled around and
blew off shore toward the river, con
fining the fire to the original four
blocks and fifty buildings. The fire
giant was beaten back just as he was
about to devour the Victoria Hotel and
Alex. McDonald's new $75,000 three
story building at the corner of First
avenue and Second street. More of Mc-
Donald's luck! He lost $10,000 in the
Postoffice building, but saved $75,000.
In that block are the Alaska Commer
cial Company's store, the North Ameri
can Trading and Transportation Com
pany's store, other big supply stores,
nearly all the big variety theaters,
gambling houses and sporting resorts,
untouched by the fire though directly
in its path. Thus is a large section of
Dawson in ashes, under an ashen sky;
thus was the remainder saved.
When the giant fire showed signs of
subjugation other fires broke out in
different parts of the city. Incendiar
ists secretly set fire to several places.
They were assisted by that class of
people to whom the opportunity for
pilfering was. too good to be lost â and
Dawson has her full share of them
from all parts of the earth. When it
was seen that attempts were being
made to burn down the entire town the
Indignation of the people was without
bounds. Hanging would have been a
death full of sunshine and redolent of
roses compared to the punishment in
flicted had the incendiaries been caught,
for the crowd cried: "Pitch 'em into the
fire!" "Burn 'em at the stake!" and
indulged in other expressions indicative
of a kindred, pleasant shuffling off of
this mortal coil.
The Aurora Hotel, First avenue and
Second street, was entered, a pile of
shavings dumped into a corner of an
upstairs room, kerosene poured over it
and the mass ignited. Nellie Dudley,
a chambermaid, discovered the fire and
it was extinguished before there was
more serious damage than a hole in the
carpet.
About 9:30 o'clock another fire was
discovered in the new police hospital, as
yet unoccupied. A hole was burned in
the roof and a part of the interior
badly charred. At about 3 o'clock in
the afternoon fire broke out in the
Juliette, a place in the rear of the
Northern Soloon. This was in the cen
ter of the block north of the burned dis
trict, toward which the wind was blow
ing directly in the path of the big fire
and adjacent to the block occupied by
tha Alaska Commercial* Company. The
flames were breaking through the roof
when the Ahrens engine swooped down
and drowned them out.
A second time was the food supply of
Dawson Bayed. With the big ware
house destroyed there would not be
sufficient provisions for the winter.
Widespread suffering from hunger and
actual death would have been inevit
able, as It is not possible to take in
food enough over the ice to feed so
large a population. Hundreds would
have started for the coast and died on
the way.
For two days the engine poured water
on the extensive ruins, and. on ac
count of danger from incendiaries,
steam was kept up for a week. The
most favorable time for robbery was
when the fire and excitement w^re at
their heights, and a great deal of it
was done. It is now impossible to tell

Bsedal Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Nov. 14.
President McKinley is extremely de
sirous that some understanding be
reached at Paris so that he may treat
the subject conclusively in his annual
message. He does not attempt to con
ceal his impatience, which amounts to
irritation, when conversing with Cabi
net officers. One of the latter said to
The Call correspondent to-day that the
President was resolved to have no more
dilly-dallying. He insists upon retain
ing all of the islands of the Philippine
archipelago. The report to the con
trary published in New York papers is
incorrect. He said:
"We do not look for a rupture of the
negotiations at Paris, but will be pre
pared for any contingency."
This official did not say what these
preparations are, but it is pretty well
understood in "Washington that the
Navy Department's order for our war
vessels to rendezvous in Hampton
Roads was made in anticipation of a
rupture of the peaceful negotiations
with Spain and a possible naval dem
onstration to be made on the coast of
Spain or the Canary Jlslanda.
AN ULTIMATUM TO
SPAIN IN PROSPECT
NEW YORK, Nov. 14.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: Chairman Day
and his colleagues will present a note
to the Spanish Commissioners on Wed
nesday, peremptorily demanding the
relinquishment by Spain of the soverÂ«
eignty over the Philippines.
This note will not be in the form of
an ultimatum, nor is it intended to be
such, but the administration is tired
of Spanish procrastination and intends
the matter shall be settled promptly.
It was learned definitely to-day that
the instructions which were sent to the
Peace Commissioners on Saturday last
were very emphatic in declaring that
there should be no further discussion
of the question of the right of the
United States to take the Philippine Is
lands, but Snain should finally an
nounce whether or not she would agree
to the â¢American demand to cede the
archipelago.
These instructions are intended to
strengthen the hand of the American
Commissioners in pressing their de
mand upon Senor Rios and his asso
ciates.
It is expected the Spaniards will
withdraw on the plea that they con
eider it necessary to consult their Gov
ernment and an adjournment for a few
days will be permitted, but at the next
sitting of the commission, if the Span
iards continue to press the discussion
of the question, an ultimatum will be
submitted, which will finally determine
whether this Government shall peace
fully or forcibly possess itself of thÂ«
Philippines. -. Â
TIME GIVEN SPAIN
FOR MAKING ANSWER
PARIS, Nov. 14.â 1t has been decided
that there will be no joint session of
the Peace Commissions to-day. Secre
tary Moore of the United States Com
mission received from Secretary OJedÂ»
of the Spanish Commission this morn^
Ing a note saying that the Spanish
Commissioners had found It Impossible
to prepare their memorandum for pre
sentation to-day and asking If thÂ»
United States Commissioners would be
inconvenienced if, owing to the late ar
rival from Madrid of expected data,
the Spaniards should request that the
next meeting be deferred until Wednes
day. Secretary Moore replied that the
A nerican Commissioners were quite
r .ady to accommodate the Spaniards iÂ»"
this matter, and the joint session was
practically deferred until Wednesday
next.
Importance is attached to this delay,
it being regarded as Indicating that tha
Spanish Commissioners are preparing
for a final stand in these negotiations,
and It may now be definitely stated
that they will not sign a treaty of peace
which yields to Spain no more from the
Philippine Islands than has thus far
been offered or indicated by the Ameri
cans. Should the latter announce that
the United States is only willing to re
imburse Spain for her pacific expendi
tures in the Philippine Islands the
Spanish Commissioners wwiltl t reply tnat
their mission is finished. Should this
occur It is possible that the Spaniards
will also suggest a suspension of the
negotiations -through the commission
and a resumption of negotiations be
tween Madrid and Washington.
The attitude of the Spaniards is ex
plained by the fact that the member*
of the Spanish Commission have po
litical alliance personal responsi
bilities to constituencies and the na
tional creditors of Spain restricting
them to certain lines which are as far
as the Ministry at Madrid cares to saw2
It is pointed out that if the five Span
ish Con.missioners here signed a treaty
yielding the Philippine Islands to the
United States without lessening Spain's
debt in an appreciable degree they
could not return home vith the pros
pect of any political future before
them, and possibly would be In danger
of violence at the hands of mobe.
At the next meeting of the C >mmis
sions the Americans will learn the defi
nite attitude of Spain on every propo
sition thus far made. The Spaniards,
however, in this presentation will not
declare all negotiations closed. They
â¢will insist that the sovereignty of Spain
over the Philippine Islands is beyond
pv estion, but will announce Spain's
readiness to yield that sovereignty for
an adequate equivalent, and will then
invite negotiations under the Spanish
construction of the protocol. The
American Commissioners may then
communicate their final attitude to the
Spaniards, but the Americans are ex
pected at a future meeting to present
carefully prepared conclusions of thoir
conte-tion and -nnditions. Should they
be no different from those already pre
sented the time will then have arrived
when Spai:. will declare herself help
less though steadfast and will await
the next step of the United States,
whatever it will be. Thus Spain will
be able to say to her creditors that she
has done her 'most and that the issue
must rest between them and the United
Statos.
A dispatch to the Temps from Ma
drid says the officials there do not be
lieve the peace negotiations will be
broken off. It adds:
"If the United States persist in their
present claims, Spain will accept the
conditions after formally announcing
at ;i session of the commission and in a
circular to the powers that she yields
â¢to force and owing to the impossibility
of renewing the war without unobtain
able assistance in defense of her
rights.

FOh ACTIVE WARFARE
NORFOLK, Va., Nov' 14.â Twenty
thousand six-pound shells will be
shipped to the Mare Island yard Mon
day. Three freight cars will be re
quired to convey the ammunition
across the continent.^ Orders have been
received at the yard to work night and
day on the gunboat Princeton, in or
der that she may, as soon as possible,
join the squadron which is to assemble
in Hampton Roads, of which the
cruiser New York is the flagship.
The order also stated that work must
be pushed nn. the monitors Puritan and
Terror, so that they will be available
for service on short notice.
The activity indicated by the ship
ment of ammunition from the Atlantic
to the Pacific and the ordering of night
work, for the first time since the auxil
iary fleet was being equipped for ser
vice at the beginning of hostilities, is
significant, say naval men. The am
munition shipment to Mare Island is,
in all probability, going to Manila, for
the American squadron has shot away
much of its rapid fire ammunition.
SENATOR STEWART SAYS
HE WILL BE RETURNED
Late Returns From Nevada Indicate
That the Silverites Have
Carried the State.
.CHICAGO,- Nov. 14.â United States Sen
ator Stewart of Nevada to-day telegraph
ed the following to the Associated Press
from Carson, New:
The Nevada Legislature Is composed of forty
five members on joint ballot. The Sliver party
has elected thirty. The Pllver Democrats have
elected two, who will undoubtedly act with
th(? Silver party. The Republicans have elected
thirteen, but two of their seats are seriously
contested. The Silver party In its convention

Fhall undoubtedly haVe two-thirds majority In
the Legislature. It 14 not known now tbe Re
publicans will vote. SNo Silver party man is
running axalnSt me and no straight-out Re
publican Is seeking the Republican vote. In
1592 I received the unanimous vote of the Silver
men and RejjubllcaiiF.
"WILLIAM M. STEWART.
CARSON CITY, Nov. 14.-Reinhold Sad
ler will be the next Governor of Nevada.
The vote between the Republican nom
inee, William McMillan, and the choice
of the Silver Party has been very close,
with McMillan in the lead, but returns
from outlying districts have placed Sad
ler in the lead by only seventeen vote 6. j
There are some sixty votes to hear from,
but as they will be for the Democratic or i
Silver candidates, the result cannot be ;
changed.
An interesting feature of the vote has j
presented itself. Ballots were forwarded
to the First Nevada Cavalry, now aboard
a transport on the way to Manila, and
its vote, if declared valid, may determine
the election of Governor. The vote for
Controller and Attorney General has
been close, but Sam Davis and W. D.
Jones, the Silver nominees for the re
spective offices, are now in the lead and
cannot be overtaken. This will leave
only one office to be filled by a. Repub
lican.
Senator W. M. Stewart has 35 votes In
the Legislature on joint ballot, which is
more than enough to re-elect him.
Three more complaints were made out
and sworn to against Edmund James this

CURRY WILL PROBABLY
BE SECRETARY OF STATE
This Is the Tale Told by the
Latest Revised Figures Re=
ceived Up to Date.
According to the latest revised figures on the vote for Secretary
of State it appears that C. F. Curry is elected to that office
In the table of figures furnished by the Western Union Telegraph
Company to the three San Francisco morning papers on the night of
Thursday. November 10, the totals given for the two loading candi
dates for Secretary of State were as follows:
C. F. Curry 104,366
R. A. Thompson 109,025
This table gave the canvass, as far as it had progressed at that
time, by counties. A careful and undoubtedly correct addition of
the returns for Thompson show that his total should have been
100.025 instead of 109,025, an error of 9000 in favor of the Democratic
candidate.
Accepting the figures by counties as given by the Western Union
Telegraph Company as correct, Curry had a net plurality of 4341.
Since then complete returns have been received from Amador,
Del Norte, Glenn, Lake, Riverside, San Benito. San Joaquin. Sierra.
Stanislaus and Yolo counties. These increase Curry's plurality by 72,
making his net plurality at this time 4413.
SMITH BARELY
ESCAPES DEFEAT
West Too Clever for the
"Mysterious."
TWENTY ROUNDS TO A DRAW
LIVELY MATCH FOUGHT AT
CATCH-WEIGHTS.
Decision Rendered According to
Agreement Against a Ruling
Based on Points
Scqred.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BRIDGEPORT. Conn.. Nov. 14.â"Mys
terious Billy" Smith and Tommy Wesc
sparred a twenty-round draw at the
Horizon Athletic Club at catch weights
to-night. West outpointed his oppon
ent, but the decision was according to
the agreement. West outweighed
Smith fully ten pounds, though the lat
ter had the advantage in heigh* and
reach. Smith put up a goad strong
fight, but was wild in his swings, while
on the other hand West was cool and
confident throughout the entire bout.
Notwithstanding that Smith had been
clearly outpointed the first half of the
bout there was money offered on him
after the tenth round. 100 to 80. though
West was a slight favorite when the
bout opened.
Smith's work was not as clean in the
breaks as his opponent's, and his con
tinually hitting in the clinches called
forth frequent hisses from the specta
tors.
West drew first blood in the second
round, and in tbe sixth narrowly miss
ed putting Smith out by a bang on the
jaw. Again in the fifteenth round he
closed Smith's eye with a left hook and
followed it up by landing thrice in
quick succession on the injured eye.
Throughout the bout Smith did most of
the rushing, but he was invariably
blocked. In the nineteenth round West
landed on the jaw so effectively that
Smith was forced to the ropes, and a
corking left and some strong body
blows were expected to settle the event,
but the gong interposed. There was a
mix-up in the final round, and again
West landed just as the bell rang.

TROOPS AT MANILA
TO BE RELIEVED
General Corbin's Letter to Colorado's
Governorâ General Merriam Is
Rather Doubtful.
DENVER, Nov. 14. â Govern ar Adams has received a tmesram
from Adjutant General Corbin to the effect that the volunteer regi
ments now doing duty in the Philippines are to be ordered home as
soon as the troops now en route for the islands reach there to take
their places. The Governor had written the adjutant general request
ing the discharge of a young son of a prominent Denver family. In his
reply General Corbin said:
"In reply I have the honor to inform you that it Is the purpose
of the War Department to return to the United States within a few
months the volunteer regiments now serving in Manila, other volun
teer regiments now being on th.?ir way to replace them. It is oe
lieved this will have been accomplished and the soldier for whom
you write will return to you about as soon as though his discharge
were ordered immediately."
Governor Adams is of the opinion that the troops will be at
home some time in January.
General Merriam, when shown the dispatch from the adjutant
general, said that he had not heard of the coming of any troops to
this city to be sent to the Philippines to relieve those already there.
He thought that when the Government began the liquidation of the
immense transport expense that has been incurred in sending troops
to Manila no more would be sent.
The Call last week published an exclusive article that it was ru
mored that several regiments were to be sent here, but General Mer
riam knew nothing of the report. He, however, admitted that he
had never been Informed of the arrival of any of the other troops
until they had arrived here.

HOOLEY'S DICKER
FOR A BARONETCY
Claims to Have Put Up
Â£50,000.
SCENE IN THE COURTROOM
SIR WILLIAM MARRIOTT IN A
RAGE.
Declares the Charge Is an Abom
inable Lie â Promoter Threatens
to Throw Him Out of
the Box.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Nov. 14.â The examination
in bankruptcy proceedings of Ernest
Terah Hooley, the company promoter,
was resumed to-<_.ay.
Sir William Marriott took the stand !
and declared that Mr. Hooley's state- i
mcnt that ho had paid the witness
Â£1000 for introducing him (Hooley) to
the Carlton Club was a "pure inven
tion and an abominable lie." Sir Wil
liam added that he know nothing at the
time about Mr. Hooley's alleged dona
tion of Â£10,000 to the Conservative
party funds throurh the Marquis of [
A her .ivonny, though Mr. Hooley told !
him afterward that he had given the
Marquis Â£10,000 for the "fighting fund"
of the party, which Sir William Marri
ott explained had nothing to do with
the Carlton Club. Tbe witness also
said he had helped Mr. Hooley in po
litical and financial matters, but had
always declined remuneration for his
services.
Later Sir William said Mr. Hooley
tc-ld him in December, 1896. that he
was going to raise an enormous loan
for Cuba and said he (the witness) had
been appointed counsel to the compa
ny's commission, which was to visit
Cuba, and that his fee was to be Â£10,
000, in view of which Mr. Hooley paid
him Â£1000 on account.
On cross-examination Sir William ad- j
mitted that he had received a check I
for Â£50,000 from Mr. Hooley, which he â 
handed representatives of the Con- ;
servative party. Mr. Hooley believed ;
this would secure him a baronetcy at
thf> jubilee, but he was informed he
could not have it and the check was
returned to him.
During Sir William Marriott's ex
amination Mr. Hooley made a scene
and threatened to pitch the witness out
of the box.
While Sir George Lewis, Q. C, was
cross-examining Sir William the wit
ness several times got angry and re
fused to answer questions put to him. [
Mr. Hooley on cross-examination flatly \
, contradicted the evidence of Sir Wil- |
1 Ham Marriott. He reiterated his state- j
i ment that he had promised and had ,
I raid to Sir William Â£1000 for an intro
| duction to the Carlton Club. Sir Wril
i Ham, Mr. Hoolf added, told him that
he did "all the dirty work" for the j
I Conservative party. Sir William sug- ;
! gested the sriving of Â£50,000 by Mr.
i Hooley for a baronetcy, and he was to
Â«ret Â£10,000 if Mr. Hoole*- was made a
baronet.
ARCHBISHOP OF
OREGON DIES OF
HEART DISEASE
BALTIMORE, Nov. 14.â William Hinckley Gross, Archbishop of
Oregon in the Roman Catholic church, died at St. Joseph's Hospital,
this city, to-day of heart disease. Archbishop Gross came here to
attend a celebration at St. Charles College, Elliott City, Md., and
was taken sick November 6, since which time he has been confined
to his bed in St. Joseph's Hospital. It was thought until this morn
ing that his condition was Improved and that he would recover, but
a sudden change for the worse resulted in his death.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 14.â The Most Rev. William H. Gross. D.
D., third Archbishop of Oregon, was born in the city of Baltimore on
June 12. 1837. The Gross family came originally from Alsace, and its
American founder, Jacob Gross, and his son, John J. Gross, took part
in the defense of Baltimore in 1812. The Archbishop's father, Jacob
Gross, the second, was engaged in mercantile business in Baltimore
and he also held office as one of the officials of the port of Balti
more. The Archbishop's mother, Rachel was a descendant of an
Irish exile of 1798.
The Archbishop often referred, both in private and public, to the
saintly and devoted mother who with tender care and loving solicitude
watched over his early years. When she died his sister, Mary Cor
delia Gross, then but sixteen years of age, took her place and for
twenty years performed all the duties of a mother toward her six
younger brothers.
The Archbishop received his early education at the parochial
school attached to St. Vincent's Church, Baltimore. In this church
he also made his first communion. In 1857 he was invested with the
religious habit and formally began his career as a redemptorlst
novice.
In March, 1563, the deceased prelate was ordained a prelate at
Annapolis, Md., by Archbishop Kendrick of Baltimore. He remained
a part of the time as army chaplain at Annapolis. His experiences
during the civil war were of a trying order.
In July, 1871. he was sent to Boston for mission work, in which he
was pre-eminently successful. While engaged in this work the Holy
See appointed. him successor to Bishop Persici of Savannah, Ga.
When Archbishop Seghers of Oregon resigned, in 1884, in order to
devote his life more particularly to the Indian missions of the* extreme
Northwest, the Holy See selected Bishop Gross to succeed him.

MAY BAR AMERICANS
FROM THE KLONDIKE
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
VICTORIA, Nov. 14.â The "o-ere crit
icism by Americans, both at Dawson
and in the States, of the official* at
Dawgon and the stupendous "K.cK
against the royalty exacted on the out
put of Klondike has had an unexpected
effect. Canadian and British Colum
bia authorities are now considering tho
question of shutting American gold
seekers and miners out of their terri
tory altogether. There has always ex
isted not a iittle feeling in favor of
such action among Canadians every
where, caused by the fact that the
American miners have obtained the
most and the best ground in Dawson
and other camps nearer the United
States boundary line. A decision to
this effect would apply to the new dig
gings at Lake Atlin, as well as the
Klondike creeks. Before it is put into
effect a formal demand will be made
on the United States authorities for an
extension of the same privileges to Ca
nadians in mining camps in American
territory as are given to Americans in
their territory.
Discrimination of this kind against
American claim holders of the Klondike
would doubtless embarrass them in
many ways and result in financial dis
advantage to them. One way to do it
would be to compel aliens to pay a
heavy royalty, while requiring of Ca
nadians only a comparatively small per
cent of the output of their ground. The
authority for the statement that such
action is imminent is an official of the
customs office here.

NEGOTIATIONS IN PROGRESS
TO SETTLE THE DEBTS
OF THE CENTRAL PACIFIC.
NEW YORK, >ov. 14.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald says: NegotM-tions between the commission for the settlement of
the Central PÂ»elflc Railway debt and the officials of the railway
are now in progress.
Under the act of July 7, 1898, the Secretary of the Treasury, the
Secretary of the Interior and the Attorney General were made a com
mission to arrange the terms of settlement with the road, subject to
the approval of the President. The law provides that the commis
sion shall not accept less than the amount due the United States
for principal and Interest, the deferred payments to bear interest
at not less than 3 per cent, and the final payment not to be post
poned more than ten years. The basis of settlement is to be ar
ranged within one year from the passage of the act.
The report that the Indebtedness is to be settled in full on July 8,
next year, is at least premature.
Attorney General Grigjo* said to-day that while several proposi
tions had been under consideration informally, the representatives of
the road had not yet made a definite proposition of settlement.
The net indebtedness of the Central Pacific to the Government on
the Ist of November amounted to $53,523,772 75.

OVERDUE PAY

MOB CALLS AT THE PALACE

PROMISES.

Proceed to Neuvitas to Compel
the Malcontents to
JSmbark.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, Fla., Nov. 14.â Private
report* from Puerto Principe and Neu
vitas, Cuba, say that 7000 regular sol
diers mulined and demanded their pay j
before embarking for Spain. About |
4000 armed men, the report adds, pre
sented themselves in front of the pal
ace, calling on the Military Governor, j
Emilio March, for their overdue pay-
Thereupon General March drew his '
sword and ordered them to disband, j
The soldiers refused to obey, and so .-lie j
of them, armed with loaded rifles,
threatened the life of General March, \
who returned his sword to its scab
bard, crying out:
"Do you wish to kill me? Well, kill
me."
The soldiers in reply shouted: "No,
no; we only want our pay before em
barking for Spain."
General March promised them that
they would be paid, and the soldiers re
turned to their quarters peaceably.
The steamer Alva left Havana four
days ago with $150,000 with which to
pay these soldiers who were to embark
immediately for Spain.
The cruiser Alfonso XIII and the
gunboats Conde de Venadito and In
fanta Isabel, have proceeded for Neu
vitas to compel the soldiers to embark,
after which they will proceed to Gi
bara for a like purpose and will then
go to Spain, unless new orders are re
ceived.
HAVANA, Nov. 13 (via Key West,
Fla., Nov. 14.â The mutiny of the Orden
Publico forces, which for two days
threatened the peace of this city, has
resulted in the dissolution of that body
to-day, when, after the payment of
some arrears and the promise ot a full
liquidation, the revolting troops laid
down their arms. Captain General
Blanco then ordered all the foot and
mounted regiments of the Orden Pub
lico to be disbanded, that organization
ceasing to exist from this date.
As originally planned, it was intend
ed that the mutiny should have ex
tended to the Guardia Civile and the
artillery regulars, and it would in that
event have assumed much graver im
portance and might perhaps have in
augurated a reign of terror and blood
shed in the island.
For some time past the uprising of
the troops in consequence of the non
receipt of their pay has been feared.
Not only is their money owing for
months, and in some cases for years,
but the reÃerve pay of the soldiers,
their savings since the date of their en
listment, which were looked upon by
them as sacred, have been appropri
ated or stolen, as the men say, by the
Government, which now turns a deaf
ear to their protests.
What amount this reserve nay
reaches it is impossible to estimate
but it is known that it aggregates mil
i lions. This is what has been precipi
tating riots, causing mutiny here, /fm
pelling the men to insubordination at
Neuvitas, and which may yet give rise
to further widespread disturbances in
the island.
The Havana mutiny, which was
started yesterday, was precipitated by
j General Arclas, the Military Governor
! of the city, whose fiery temper and bru
j tal treatment of officers is the source of
daily spreading discontent.
The city to-day continues to be pa
trolled by regulars who are quartered
in the principal thoroughfares, parks
j and squares of the city. This upris
' ing, which has been settled on the only
; possible basis, that of cash, affords a
! palpable illustration of the condition of
\ affairs here, and of the utter demorali
| zation of even the army, where the of-
I fleers have lost control of the troops.
Although the possibility of further
uprisings is scouted among the miliÂ«
tary authorities, there is reason to bo
; lieve that trouble is anticipated among
1 the Guardia Civile, artillery and even
other regular forces, as proved by thÂ«
i fact that the troops continue to be con
fined to their quarters, and that the city
of Havana is practically in a state of

WELL ON THE
OPENING DAY
The Talent Often in
Line at Ingleside.
THREE FAVORITES IN FRONT
MORKLLITO CAPTTTBED THE
UNIVERSITY STAKE
P iggxjtt Was in Great Form, Piloting
Four Winners â Miss Ravrena
Defeated a Fashionable
Set in Fast Time.
Ingleside track is now out for its share
of the racing plum, and threw open the
gates to a comfortable crowd yesterday.
The card was only a fairish one, eliciting
no great amount of favorable comment.
Nineteen bookmakers posted odds, and in
the hustle and bustle to create business
such a shrewd judge of prices as Elie
Perles could probably have discovered a
"Dutch."
It was Pigg-ott's day In the saddle. The
California youth piloted four of the five
winners, his cleverness alone getting two
of themâ First Tenor and Mistral llâ to
the wire first. Cromwell and Bernardillo
:he beaten choices.
James F. Caldwell was seen to good ad
vantage "With the starting gate. He used
no recall 1W&. and the different fields were
diHpatcheo," almost perfectly aligned.
By way^of embellishment, the Univer
sity stak? over a mile, valued at $1000,
was served up to racegoers. It was a
dreadfully dismal, tame affair. Morelllto
was a 1 to 8 choice over four common
platers, and then had to be kicked along
for six furlongs by Piggott before taking
the lÂ«ad. The brown colt won handily
enough from Cyril, a visitor from the
otherlside of the hills, racing In' the colors
of P. Ryan. Rosormonde, the second
choice, was third.
By far the best performance of the day

was that of Miss Rowena in '-he conclud
ing six furlong sprint. She was meeting
such fast ones as Mary Black and Fleur
do Us but reports of her superb condi
tion sent the chestnut m^re to the post
a 6 to E favorite. She picked up 30i>
pounds, and leading f:om the jump, head
ed Mary Black past the judges four
lengths "in 1:14 flat. Fleur de Lis, evident
ly short, finished in ;he show.
The Burns & TVat.Thouse entry, tirst
Tenor, was a prime favorite for the two
vear-old soramMe at six furlongs, and
narrowly escaped defeat. Los Medanos,
with Ruttor '.:p. and 15 to 1 in the ring,
fought every foot of the journey and in
a great du>. i through the stretch was
beat, n out but a nose by the first choice.
Anchored led during the early stages of
the running, eventually ending up third.
Mistrial 11, the game imported horse,
took the mile and a sixteenth selling af
fair. Figgott had the leg up, and Btrlk
the stretch third, to Bliss Rucker and
Cromwell, gradually passed these two
hordes, and hard ridden, won by a couple
of lengths. Personne came fast the last
part, being beaten but a head for the
]\a â¢'<â¢ by Bliss Rucker. Cromwell, which
da 1 to 2 chance and receded to
even money, died on Beauchamp's hands
In the sail home.
Dr. Rowell's gelding Whitcomb downed
a big field in the seven furlong run, de
cided under selling conditions. He was
backed from 6 down to 4, and with little
Reiff in the saddle led the 60 to 1 shot
McFarlane over the line a length. Ber
nardillo. the favorite, ran out with Wood
at the head of the stretch, finishing last.
Turf Notes.
The Chase 6aJe of yearlings will take
place to-night at the Occidental Horse
Exchange. Some superbly bred young
sters will pass under the hammer.
William Dozier, quite an extensive Chi
cago speculator, was present at the races
yesterday. This is not Mr. Dozier's first
trip to the coast.
No "dope" student should be without a
copy of the Daily Racing News form
book. It Is invaluable in picking winners,

Plan is certainly a greatly improved j
horse and somebody overlooked a bargain, I
as last spring he could have been pur- i
chased for a song. "Butch" Fisher later
had the gelding verved and now he seems j
to stand the racket.
Frank Rutter had but three mounts j
yesterday. He was twice second and once

NOTORIOUS DISDE BAR
WEDS A FOURTH TIME
Captures Frank Dutton Jackson, a
Young but Eccentric
Californian.
NEW YORK, Nov. 14.â A New Orleans
special to the Herald says: Editha Lo
litha, Countess Landsfeldt and Baroness
Rosenthal, a native of Florence, Italy,
daughter of Ludwig-, King of Bavaria, and
Lola Monteza, married for the fourth
time yesterday. Stripped of all her titles,
Editha Lolitha. the self-styled Princess,
is Mrs. Dis de Bar, the woman who man
aged to impress Judge Luther R. Marsh
of New York with her occult powers and
make him part with many thousands of
his wealth.
The man who led Mrs. Dis de Bar to the
altar for the fourth time is Frank Dutton
Jackson. He is 33 years of age. Mrs.
Jackson's ilrst husband was Paul Noel
Massant of New York. He died in 1872,
Seven years followed, which the woman,
says she spent in the Kast studying the
black arts. Then she came back to New
York and married General Dis de Bar.
While the generaTs wife she fleeced Juripp
Marsh under the cover of spiritualism and
wan smt to prison. Dis de Bar got a di
vorce. When she got out of prison sne

after a few years, leaving all his property
to his widow.

visit a few months ago. Jackson is a son
of the superintendent of the McNeer es
tate in California. He was educated in a
Presbyterian college, latfr studying for
the Congregational ministry, but aban
doned this to become a fruitarianâ kind of
first cousin to a vegetarian. It is the in
tention of the newly married couple to es
tablish a colony in Florida, where Jack
son owns 7000 acres of land In Lee Coun
ty. adjoining the property of Inomas A.
Edison Those who are admitted to the

FOR GIVING
TESTIMONY
Why Chung Yet Den
Lost His Life.
MARKED HEADS ARE UNEASY
THE CHINESE MURDER CAUSES
TEAR OF MORE TROUBLE.
Ng Gock, a Leader of the Tsuey
Sings, Arrested for Vagrancy,
but Held Without Bail
for Trial.
Investigation on the part of the police
and some of the Chinamen most vitally
interested leads to the belief that the mur
der of Chung Yet Den Sunday night was
not on account of the tailor war, but was
due entirely to the fact that he had tes
tified against Man Non, who shot Lum
Sler and Officer Tracer- This fact, how
ever, has not set at rest the minds of the
men on whose heads the highbinders have
placed prices, and numerous meetings of
the various tongs last evening did not
tend to soothe them.
Detectives Gibson and Wren and Officer
McMahon yesterday afternoon arrested
Kg Gock and charged him with keeping
a disreputable house and being a vagrant.
A significant fact of the arrest is that he
is held without bonds. Ng Gock is a
prominent member of the Tsuey Sing
Tong, to which Man Non belonged, anu
the one which is supposed to have desired
the death of Chung Yet Den. The latter
was president of the Tsuey Sings, of
which Lum Sier was a member. "Whim the
police are reticent in regard to the arrest,
it is not believed that they think Ng Gock
the murderer, but it is tnought he is be
ing held in order to attempt to gain from
him some information in regard to the
shooting.
D. "Wing, the overall manufacturer,
whose head is worth JtiOO to some ven
turesome highbinder, said last night that
he had learned the Tsuey Sings had of
fered $250 for the death of Chung Yet Den,
but he also believes the shooting, though
not directly traceable to the tailors' war,
was in the nature of a blow at himseif.
Wing announced that he would leave this
morning for a vacation of several weeks,
but the sly look in his eye meant he was
leaving to save himself from the high
binder's bullet.
Several tongs held meetings at their
various rooms, but what actions were
taken could not be learned, for. those who
attended didn't "sabe."

PRICE OF SUGAR ADVANCED.
First General Advance Since the
Cutting War Began.
NEW YORK. Nov. 14.â The Tribune will
say to-morrow: The American Sugar
Refining Company yesterday (Monday)
advanced the price of all grades or do
mestic refined sugars one-eighth of a
cent a pound, this move being promptly
followed by the independent refineries.
The increase makes the price of granu
lated 5% cents a pound, or 4.54 cents net,
inclusive of trade discounts, and is the
first general advance since the beginning
of the cutting of prices between the
American Sugar Refining Company and
the outside companies.
BOXCAR IN FI/AMES.
Narrow Escape of a Freight Train at
Redding. *
REDDING, Nov. 14.â An extra through
freight train, north bound, came flying
into the Redding yards this forenoon with
a portion of the train on fire. Smoke
was pouring out of a sealed boxcar and
as the heavy train slowed up in the city
limits flames were just breaking through
the roof of the car. The burning car
was halted in front of a standpipe con
nected with the city mains, and In a
moment the full pressure of a six-inch
main was flooding the flaming boxcar, ex
tinguishing the nre before much damage
was done. The standpipe was put in not
more than a week ago, and had it not
bÂ«en for its presence a large portion of
the train would doubtless have been con
sumed. The origin of the fire is a mys
tery.

SUBMIT EVIDENCE
OF DREYFUS' GUILT
Important Testimony Believed to
Have Been Given by Zurlinden
and Chanoine.
PARIS. Nov. 14.â The Court of Cassa
tion to-day examined General Zurlinden
and General Chanoine, who recently re
signed successively the portfolio of Minis
ter of War, and it is believed that their evi
dence was highly important in upholding
the attitude they have taken throughout
that Dreyfus is guilty and that a com
munication of the secret dossier would
compromise the safety of the state and
the good relations of France with foreign
nations. _
General Zurlinden, now Military Gover
nor of Paris, has decided to send Lieuten
ant Colonel Picquart before a court-mar
tial on the charge of having communicat
ed to his counsel, M. Le Blois, a chapter
of the Dreyfus dossier containing the let
ter about ' "That canaille D ," since
known to be a forgery, through the con
fession of the late Lieutenant Colonel
Henry.
NO TARIFF TINKERING
AT THE WINTER SESSION
Congressman Dingley Declares There
Is No Cause for Any Bevenue
Legislation.
NEW YORK, Nov. 14.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
"There will be no tariff revision nor any
revenue legislation of any kind during
the session of Congress this winter," was
the declaration made to me with much
emphasis this evening by Representative
Dingley, chairman of the House Commit
tee on Ways and Means. "There^is no
reason for any revenue legislation," con
tinued Mr. Dingley, "and you can say
definitely that there will be none. It
may be possible that some slight amend
ments of administrative features of the
war revenue bill may be desirable and
some such amendments may be enacted,
but there will bo no general legislation
in the way of removing taxes or chang
ing rates."

CLEVEB MONTEREY ARCHITECT
Young Emory Frazier's Important
Mission to England.
MONTEREY. Nov. 14.â Word has been
received here that Emory Frazier, son of
D. K. Frazier of this place, who has been
studying architecture at the Drexel Insti
tute of Technology at Philadelphia for
the past two years, has just received a
commission of extraordinary importance
and honor for so young an architect. He
has been selected to go to London to
make drawings and plans from the build
ing itself of one of that city's most fa
mous churches, and from his drawings
the church is to be reproduced in Phila
delphia.
Young Frazier is a Monterey boy, a na
tive son. and is about 23 years of age. He
took the course in architecture at Stan
ford University in 1595 and was told by his
instructors that Stanford did not have the
high course requisite for one who showed
such marked ability in that particular
line.
He sailed for London a week ago to re
main about ten months. On his return
he will enter the office of a celebrated
New York architect.

Outrageous Conduct
of Three Soldiers.
BROKE INTO A HOUSE
THE FAMILY FORCED TO FLEE
FOR THEIR LIVES.
With Drawn Revolvers the Men
Enter the Besidence of Michael
â¢ Dugan and Hurl Defiance
at Him.
With drawn revolvers three soldiers |
Sunday night entered the residence of i
Michael Dugan, at 133 Russ street, and
after threatening to kill him if he in- j
terfered with them, proceeded to search
the house.
Mrs. Dugan and her two children were
gittlrg in the kitchen, and seeing the sol
diers entor they lost no time in vacating j
the premises.
After searching the house one of the
men turned to Djigun and informed him
that he was Sergeant Wilson. Without
attempting to explain the objects of his
visit he and his men left the place.
festerday Dugan visited police head
quarters and asked if he was not legally
justified in having the soldiers arrested.
In telling the story of the seemingly out
rageous conduct of "Sergeant Wilson"
and his men. he said:
"I was sitting in the kitchen of my
home with my wife and two children,
when we were startled by loud knocking i
on the front door. 1 quickly responded, ;
and as 1 opened the door the man who :
called hlmsnlt Sergeant Wilson thrust a
revolver in my face, after threatening
to riddle me with bullets if I did not re
main quiet. Not knowing what they i
were after 1 started to protest, when one
of the soldiers brushed me to one Bide
after poking me in the ribs with his re
volver.
"1 ran into the kitchen and told my
Wife t-> pick up the children and flee for
their lives. Alter searching through the)
and under the beds the men left
the house. I have no idea what they
fter. It Is possible that they were
soldiers who nad de
but why they should have e:r
my house and acted in such an outrage
ous manner Is beyond my comprehension.
I do not Intend in let the incident drop.
To-day I will employ an attorney, and
II we â  anno) have the men arrested and
[will d with the au- :
thoritives at Washington with a view of
having them dismissed from the army."
A WHOLE FAMILY
TAKEN TO PRISON
THE CTBItIENS ENGAGE IN" A
GENERAL MELEE.
Father and jaother and a Married
Daughter Are Charged With
Cruelty to Children.
The O'Brien family at 23 Brady street
rushed the "growÂ«r" so frequently Sun
day night that by 11 o'clock they were all
lighting (hunk. Policemen Calnan and
Blackmail happened to be passing- along
the street about that hour, when they
beard cries of -Murder: Police!" coming
from the bouse.
â¢ The otiu- entered the house and every
member of the family, and a neighbor,
Patrick Foley, were engaged in a general
melee. .Mrs. O'Brien was on the floor an i
three if her sons were beating her, while
she clawed at them. Chairs and tabloa
â¢vvtrre broken and the place looked as ft it
had been itruck by a cyclone.
All were placed under arrest, and while
B!ackman went to ring for the pati
wagon two of the younger members of the
family and the goat made their escape.
Seven were , taken to the Citj Prison-
John O'Brien., the father; Mary O'Brien,
the mother: May Grimes, a married
daughter, who had a baby in her arms;
Kichard, Thomas and William, sons, and
Patrick Foley. All were charged with
disturbing the peace, and the father and
mother and Mrs. Grimes were further
charged with cruelty to children.
The cases were called before Acting
Judge Kerrigan yesterday and after repri
manding the defendants the charge of dis
turbing the peace was dismissed. The
charge of cruelty to children against the
father and mother and Mrs. Grimes was
continued till to-morrow and they were
locked up in the prison. *>*; v*

WILL PT7BLLSH THE CATALOGUE
Librarian Taggart of the Mechanics'
Institute Will Make Some
Changes.
Frederick J. Taggart, the new librarian
at the Mechanics' Institute has now taken
charge and proposes to make many small
changes for the benefit and convenience
of its patrons.
There will be little variation In the
general system, as the late Mr. Jelllson
kept It In perfect order and no alteration
sr-f ms necessary. The chief change will
I* in making the catalogue public. Mr.
Taggart tea a plan for doing this which
li" considers perfectly feasible, and the
directors are favorable to such a move.
Heretofore only members have had ac
cess to the general catalogue, but it is
conceded that if the public were kept in
formed regarding the arrivals of new
publications the result would be an im
mediate Increase in the membership.
Mr. Taggart' 8 ability as a librarian is
well known throughout the country. As
assistant librarian at Stanford he had al
most entire charge of the great railroad
library at that place, and bis system of
cataloguing it lias been widely copied.
On assuming charge he found every
thing in perfect order, but objects to the
location of his office, which Is In a dark,
draughty corner. This will be remedied
as Boon as possible, and Mr. Taggart will
be ready to receive ;<nd act upon sug
gestions for the betterment of the ser
vice.

POWER OF THE
LUMBER TRUST
IS APPARENT
The Prices Take an
Upward Turn.
ADVANCE OF $1 A THOUSAND
EXPORT CARGOES WILL SOON
FEED THE EFFECTS.
Scarcity of Logs on Puget Sound
Is Given as the Cause of
the Increase in
Prices.
The lumber trust that was formed sev
eral weeks ago under the name of the
Pine Manufacturers' Association is rapid
ly accomplishing the purposes for which
It was created, and the price of lumber
Is steadily advancing.
The parties to the trust are -.enton.
Holmes & Co.; Pope & Talbot, Taciima
Mill Company, Simpson Lumber Com
pany, S. E. Slade Lumber Company, E.
K. Wood Lumber Company, D. H. Bibb
Lumber Company, Pacilic Pine Lumber
Company, Wilson Bros. & Co., J. W. Van
Schoulton, Grays Harbor Commercial
Company, Stimson Mill Company, St.
Paul and Tacoma Lumber Company, and
the Bellingham Bay Land and Improve
ment Company. Frank W. Warren is the
secretary of the trust, with offices at 29
Steuart street.
The first move of the new combine was
made on November 4, when a meeting was
held, at which it was decided to advance
cargo prices, both San Francisco and
coastwise, from 511 to $12 per thousand.
On November 10. another meeting was
held, when Jobbing prices were increased
from $14 to Sls per thousand, a uniform
increase of $1 per thousand all around.
And this does not seem to be the end,
for a still further advance is looked for
in the course of a few weeks, on cargo
and jobbing rates, while it is certain tnat
export rates will be pushed up at the next
meeting.
The members of the combine have -"Tac
tically absolute control of the pine lumber
trade and are in a position now to fix
prices to suit themselves. Moreover, they
stand a good prospect of being' able to dic
tate prices for redwood lumber in the near
future, and when they have this branch of
the trade also in their hands, there will
be nothing to check them from running
both pine and redwood up to any figure
that may suit their fancy.
The reason given for the recent advance
in prices is the scar city of logs on Puget
Sound. It is claimed the mills have found
it difficult to get anywhere near enough
to k>cp them busy. The rush .o the
Klondike and the war, it is asserted, have
drawn away so many men that it has
been impossible to secure enough hands
during the past season to get out logs to
meet the demands of the mills. Lumber
men profess to see small prospect for Im
provement during the coming season, con
sequently there is little likelihood of lum
ber dropping to the old rates for a long
time to come. ": ,. \
TO TAKE THE POUND
OUT OF POLITICS
EFFORTS JF THE MEMBERS OF
THE HUMANE SOCIETY.
Nearly All of the Board of Supervis
ors-Elect Have Promised to
Help in the Good Work.
The officers and members of the Society j
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals I
have been working like beavers since, i
and before election for that mattpr. to !
e-f-t the manag' rn^nt of the Public Pound |
out of politics and back under the direc
tion of the society again. In this move
they have the support and assistance of
the best men of the community, and from
present appearances they -will meet with
success. Thf-se efforts are not made for
the purpose of giving friends a few small
jobs as dog catchers, but to make the
pound a clean institution again. Several
years ago. when Chris Buckley was run
ning Democratic politics to suit himself,
he had for P.oundmaster Jake lAndo, and
so many complaints were made of the
manner* in which he conducted the office
that the Republican Board of Supervis
ors of eight years ago took the institu
tion out of politics and gave it over to
the care of the society named.
Modern and humane methods of Im
pounding stray and homeless animals j
were adopted and a scientific and pain- j
less manner of destroying these animal
Waifs was effected. The animals' home
and its furnishings cost many thousands
of dollars. For seven years the Public
Pound was conducted in a manner satis
factory to the people, and Beyer a com
plaint was made. Nearly a year ago this
institution was thrown back Into politics
through a disagreement between the so
ciety's poundmaster, F. A. Osborne, and
the "management of th;; society. This was
the excuse the solid eight of the present
Board of Supervisors wanted, and since
then the manner in which the pound has
been conducted has not pleased the pub
lic at all. The deputies have impounded
licensed animals and assaulted the clti
â ens of the city without warrant time
and again, and the Police Judges have
scored them for their outrages, in addi
tion to imposing heavy punishments for
violating the lews.
Before the recent election nearly all of
the Republican candidates were inter
viewed by members of the animals' so
ciety, and the assurance was given that
if ejected the pound would bo given bark
into the care of the organization. Since
the election, which returned almost an
entire Republican Ronrd of Supervisors,
nearly all of the Sunervisors-doct have
renewed their promises to take the care
of the city's animals out of the hands of
the unworthy and place It again where t
was seven years ago.

BOTH ELEVENS
ARE FEARFUL
OF A DEFEAT
Reinforcements for
Blue and Gold.
DESPERATION AT PALO ALTO
NO SECRET PRACTICE PLAYS AT
BERKELEY.
The Rooters of Both Universities Are
Preparing for Terrific Noise
Making at the Thanks
giving Day Game.
Yesterday was an eventful day for the
two college football teams, as it ushered
1 In the last week of training before the
| Thanksgiving Day game.
The members of the Stanford eleven
i who were very attentive spectators of the
! match between the Olympics and Callfor
j nia on Saturday returned to Palo Alto
' with mingled emotions of hope and gloom;
| the blue and gold went back to their n*
\ tive heath none too elated.
Perhaps the nardest practice ever
known in the history of the game on this
! coast will mark the work of the college
I elevens until they quit and rest on their
i past efforts for the annual encounter.
The practice games on the California
campus will bo of a better order than
most match games. To strengthen the
"scrub" eleven Cochran, Cadwallader and
Plunkett will be enrolled and will play
against the big team every night. The
1 graduate players who have been coaching
I the team this year will also find them
selves In the lino fighting the prize eleven
, for touchdowns.
With this opposition the fiercest and
I most grilling work will be forced upon the
! team which will represent the University
of California on the 24th.
The game on Saturday did not please
Cochran, California's coach. He antici
pated a blue and gold victory and disap
1 pointment was his store when the Olym
pics scored. For this reason he will keep
the team at harder work. It is his inten
, tion to have open practice, during which
i the team will be put through all the evo
| lotions to be used in the Big game. Se
, cret practice will not be a part of the reg
ular schedule at California.
At Palo Alto conditions are the reverse.
Toward the end of the week the team
will leave for Congress Springs, at which
i place secret practice will bo most rigidly
pursued. Not even the students of the
university will be allowed on the prac
! tice grounds at the .springs. For the last
i two years the cardinal eleven has fol
i lowed' the plan of isolated practice during
> the last few days before the final strug
gle.
A report from Palo Alto, which is sup
posed to come from a good source, is to
the effect that Parker, the cardinal's best
, end, is out of the play this year. He is
! anything but well, suffering severely from
malarial fever and is generally in a de
bilitated condition. Bad ankles, sprains
i and other ailments are running an epi
demic in the Santa Clara County institu
i tlon, if the alarming reports have any
foundation in fact.
Already preparations for processions,
systematized vociferation and sonorous
gymnastics are being made by the enthu
siasts at each university. California will
have a cosps of two hundred choice
shouters, well drilled in rhythmic noise
! making and topped with blue hats orna
mented with gold ribbons. This corps will
parade the streets and follow the college
band augmented to forty pieces, to the
grounds. Stanford is contemplating like
features, all for the sake of the god of
howls.

CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
A GaiWass of the Recently Elected School
Directors Indicates He Is JKeir
GKoice for Leader.
THE friends of Vanderlynn Stow are quite jubilant over the fact that
every indication points to his being chosen as the next presiding of
ficer of the recently elected Board of Education. The sentiment of
the new directors has been ascertained by friends of Mr. Stow and
they are assured of his selection.
Mr. Stow is admirably fitted for the duties which would thus de
volve upon him. He would bring to the office every requisite for lta
proper handling. A graduate of Harvard, he would appreciate the grave
responsibilities Imposed upon a man intq whose care is given the educa
tion of the boys and girls, the turure business men and women of the
great metropolis. Mr. Stow would also bring to the position the knowl
edge and training of a man of affairs, which is a guarantee that the
duties of the board would be administered in a businesslike manner.

READY FOR DISTRIBUTION
Meeting of the Stockholders of the
Hale & Norcross Company to
Be Held To-Day.
A meeting of the stockholders of the
Hale & Norcross Mining Company will be
held at 1 o'clock this afternoon to dis
cuss the affairs of the company and the
distribution of the money recently re
ceived by judgment of the court, but
when all the expenses have been pnid
there will not be much left for the stock
holders.
The amount paid to the Union Trust
Company by Hayward & Bogart to satisfy
the judgment was $297,000. Ol this amount,
when attorney's fees amounting to $75,000
and other expenses have boen deducted,
there will only be about $17,000 left, and
this divided among 112,000 shareholders
will mean a Very low value for the shares.
It is expected that there will be a warm
time at the meeting, and an effort will
be made to find some means of reducing
the expenses.
STRANGE STORY TOLD
BY A CHINESE SLAVE
SHE SAYS THAT HARRY HTJFF IS
ONE OF HER OWNERS.
Huff Is a Favorite Employe of Chief
Meredith of the Chinese
Bureau.
How Took, a Chinese slave girl who es
caped from a disreputable house last
Monday and took refuge in the Methodist
Chinese Mission Home on Washington
street, has told the matron a strange
story to the effect that Harry Huff , who is
at times employed by Chief Meredith as
interpreter in the Chinese Bureau, was
the owner of a Chinatown house of disre
pute and of an Interest in more than one
slave girl.
She says that two years ago she was
stolen by a gang of men near Canton and
shipped to San Francisco. She was in
structed by her captors to swear that she
was the daughter of Chan Jook, ami that
she was a native of San Francisco. The
highbinders, on her arrival here, furnish
ed the necessary witnesses, and she was
landed without any trouble. She was told
by Wong Jue, her keeper, that Harry
Huff, known by the inmates of the house
as Qui Koon, "the Master," had a half
Interest in her and another girl. Just be
fore the raid was made by the Federal
officials last September, she says, Huff
came to the house and told the inmates
of the contemplated raid. He secreted
her and another girl in a family house on
Commercial street, where they remained
until the end of the search.
It will be remembered that Huff was
employed by Chief Meredith to accom
pany the raiders as interpreter.
Huff Is frequently employed by
Meredith with the knowledge of
the Collector to act as inter
preter. After the escape of Fung Suey
Wan it was a common report in China
town that Harry Huff had dressed her in
the clothing of a white woman and, plac
ing her between two white women, put
her on board the China bound steamer.
It is expected that the special agent of
the Treasury will investigate the story of
the slave girl, the matter being within
his domain, for the reason that Huff is an
employe of the Government and is on the
rolls as a "laborer."
Huff makes a general denial of the
charge.
CHANGES AT THE GRAND.
The Old Theater "Will Once A-gain Be
a First-Class Opera House.
The management of the Grand Opera
House has completed the Hans for the
remodeling of that nopular place of
amusement and promises that by March
6 It will shine forth in all the beauty of
its new clothes. All the old seats which
have done duty so many years will be
relegated to the rubbish heap, complete
new scenery will be introduced and the
walls will be newly painted and frescoed.
The old-fashioned boxes must al9o go and
will he replaced by new and modern ones
and a row of loge boxes will be placed
around the first balcony.
The house will close in February and
the grand opening will be on March 6
with Melba and a company of 160. The
prices will be so arranged as to place the
attractions within the reach or all. al
though there will be some high-priced
seats.
"SUZETTE" IS
RICH WITH
FUN AND TUNE
Performance Needs
Better D c ; ion.
CRANE PLAY AT THE ALCAZAR
BALDWIN AND COLTJMBIA OF
FER THE SAME BILLS.
Many New Turns at the Orpheam.
Melodrama at the Comedy,
California and Mo
rosco's.
By to-night or to-morrow night the
Tivoli company will be giving a better
performance of Oscar Weil's "Suzette"
than was given last night. This ia not
to say that some hits, individual and
ensemble, were not made last night,
nor that the charm of the piece was
ever completely dlÃguised, but the per
formance was not at all representative
of the Tivoli company, which with its
present personnel is one of the clever
est comic opera organizations in Amer
ica. There were hitches galore last
night: mangled lines, long stage waits
and cues that never came; and the
stage management was loose and
scrambling. One didn't need to see
George Lask out In front sitting with
the laity to know that he had been
away to gay New York and had had no
hand in the staging. Mr. L-ask has
been a good and faithful master at the
Tivoli, and no doubt he needed a va
cation as much as the Tivoli needed
him to go East and look up the season's
novelties; but after what he and I and
a thousand other good persons saw last
night I hope that he will take off his
coat early this morning and call the
company to discipline, because "Su
zette" is worth the best that can be
given it.
"Suzette" la a comic opera of the
good old type, with a book full of trust
ful fun a heroine that wears male
clothing and music that is good enough
to be taken seriously, and is yet so easy
and amiable that it fits any mood you
may bring to bear on it. "Suzette"
was, I understand, sung here by the
Bostonians some nine or ten years ago.
My nurse didn't take me to hear it
then, so last night's show was entirely
new to me. Any comic opera ten years
of age that can be entirely new to you
and pleasing and full of fun and color
and tinkling with the tonic of spon
taneous melody is worth praising. You
would even praise a new piece that of
fered the same qualities. "Suzette"
was to me a lovely bottle that never
before had been uncorked. It was full of
fizz and bouquet and elation and tran
quillityâalthough as I hinted before the
cork might have been removed with
more elegance and certainty.
I shall not attempt to revise the "ar
gument," which you will find printed
in your programme and boiled down in
last Sunday's Call. The young woman's
change of raiment is accounted for
quite satisfactorily; it Is really a relief
to know that she did not do it of her
own accord. And you can't help but
applaud the ingenious way in which she
works the old tricks so as to get the
facetions marquis into her cast-off
gown. And when finally she sells him
his own trousers the revenge is comic
and complete.
So far as the book goes the first act
is a bit scrappy. In it are any number
of songs and very little action to ac
count for them. But the other two are
more in unity, the music pointing the
situation with fine effect.
If Mr. Weil had not written other
operatic work and some of the best of
our American songs the score of "Su
zette" alone would stamp him a musi
cian of culture and individual expres- !
sion. It is clean, lithe and symmetri
cal, polished in every detail, and never
banal, and yet so simple and free in
melody and treatment that a child
might listen and enjoy. I think I
could have had a good time with "Su
zette" ten years ago. HoweVer, as we
didn't meet in childhood's happy hour
I am denied the privilege of comparing .
the Tivoli and the Bostonian produc
tions. But the Tivoli will hold its own
in a night ot two, I am sure.
It was the movement and the spoken
text that went awry last night more
than the singing. Miss Lichter was one
who both acted and sang with
comfort. Mr. Pruette was almost
another. She was Suzette and
he the Marquis. The rest were not cer
tain enough for Tuesday morning com
pliments. ASHTON STEVENS.
Alcazar.
It was a goodly house in point of num
bers that looked upon the story of "A
Fool of Fortune"; it was a sympathetic
liouse that wept at the downfall of that
Impossibly honest Wall street firm, Cun
ningham & Lloyd; it was a merry house
tfiat laughed at the love making of 'he
impossible Count de Cluny, and it was
a very, very kind house that bore in i a
tience the too frequent, but, alas, too nec
essary, sibiiant suggestions of the over
worked prompter. It grieves the critic
to Â»ay that some of the best seems in
a splendid play were marred by rep< atÂ«'<i
prompting in the most Intense passages,
but that dereliction was amply aton.-d for
by the excellent and well balanced act
ing of the company. ,
Wallace Shaw as the Elisha cunning
ham of the piece added new laiwels to his
reputation as a careful and painstaking
actor. He did better than even the most
sanguine of his friends had expected. He
was supported right ioynWV by Clarence
Montalne as his partner, Moyd. The Xdir
jorie Cunningham of Greyhen Lyons was
a womanly character P'a/ea Â«Â» a wo
manly way. The fount of Mr. Hastings
was a little spotted in his French dia
lect, but otherwise was blameless. George
Osbourne was excrtlent. It will pay to
see "A Fool of Fortune."
New Comedy.
The New Comedy Theater was crowd
ed last night when Lincoln J. Carter's
comedy drama, "Under the Dome," was
presented. The scenery is magnificent
and the scene depleting the results of
the awful hurricane at Apia Harbor, Sa
moa in 1889, when three Oeriften and
three American battleships wore wrecked,
aroused the wildest enthusiasm in the au
dience. The company is evenly balanced.
Bert Morrison, in the part of the hero,
Ned Langmuir. a sailor, did remarkably
well, considering the fact that he had
only one rehearsal, and scored a distinct
success. He made his debut in this city
about eighteen months ago, and since
then has made rapid progress in his pro
fession. Nelson Cornpston, the bluff
bos'n of the flagship Trenton, wag in his
element. Jessie Cunnlngton as Nora Con
sldine, the heroine, ' was charming and
showed that she is possessed of strong
dramatic force. Harry B. Sutherland
and Madeline Hunt not only played their
parts well, but in their specialties won
the well merited applause of the audlÂ»
ence. The play should have crowded
houses during trie week.
Morose 3's.
"A Midnight Trust," a strong piece in
the line of melodrama, is on this week
at Morosco's. The play is splendidly
mounted and many sensations are woven
in the plot. Marie Winson, the new sou
brette, is a success. She is pretty, en
gaging and clever. Her song. "My Ho
nolulu Queen," in which two boy vo
calists in the gallery joined in the chorus,
was encored several times. James M.
Brophy, as the hero, was the admired ot
the audience. Lorena Atwood, as Clare
Dudley, and Harry Alysham gained
approval by their clever acting, while
hinders Stephens, the villain, played hia
part well. Little Venie Wells of "First
Horn" fame distingunshed herself in the
dual role of Mary and Bertie. The drama
was generously Interspersed with special
ties which were well received.
Orpheum.
There was almost an entire change of
bill at the Orpheum last nightâ six new
turns â all of which was well received. A
special hit was scored by Harry Lacy and
Miss Van Siclin in a sketch by the sensa
tional title of "Bob Racket's Pajamas."
Flo Irwin and Walter Hawley did well,
too, in "The Gay Miss Con," and the
Flood brothers pave a remarkable exhi
bition of acrobatic skill. Herbert's troupe
of twenty-two trained dogs is one of the
bÂ«st animal attractions ever offered at
tht Orpheum.
The Baldwin.
"Mistakes Will Happen " will run all
week tt the Baldwin, giving way to "Se
cret Service." an American play of inter
national success.
Columbia.
Kellar entered his second week last
night before an interested and mystified
audience. He exploited several new
tricks.
California.
"Northern Lights," the melodramatic
attraction at the California, drew a good
second night attendance.
Bush-Street "Cyrano."
The Comedy Theater management an
nounces "Cyrano de Bergerac" for next
week. The Henderson company will ap
pear in it.
A number of extra people have been en
gaged and there will be on the stage six
ty-five players in all. A large draught
of scenic artists and costumers are at
work to complete the pictorial part of the
production by Monday.
The Chutes.
"Congo, the gorilla-man," "Joe Storms
Jr., orang outang," and "Sally, chimpan
zee"âthe "lowest order of man and th<*
two highest orders of apes"â are creating
an immense sensation at the Chutes. In
the Free Theater, Durno, magician, Emily
Scheidler, the Australian trapezist, and
many others contribute to a good bill.
GREAT STEAMSHIP OWNER.
A. Raggio Will Establish a Line to
South America.
A. Raggio, agent and one of the prin
cipal owners of the Italian Commercial
Steamship Company of Genoa, arrived
here yesterday and registered at the
Grand.
He is one of three brothers and four
cousins of the same name, controlling the
Steamship Company. Tneir many steam"
t-rs and sailing vessels bear the family
name. They have seven large steam
ers, all told, many large sailing vessels
and numerous smaller ones, and carry
freight exclusively all over the world.
"My object in coming here," said Mr.
Raggio last evening, "is to arrange for
business between South America and the
United States. My idea is to take wine
from here to South American ports,
Buenos Ayres or Valparaiso; load corn
there for Europe, and return with a gen
eral cargo to this port. My first at
tempt of the kind will be made with ves
sels chartered here â not our own â and I
expect to arrange for one inside of a
week. I have 3 us t come from the Italian-
Swiss colony and was much pleased with
it and Its wines. I have visited Bor
deaux and many large vineyards in Italy,
but have never seen finer vineyards, nor
better facilities for wine making."
The title of Count was conferred on
Mr. Raggio'B uncle, Edilio Raggio, for his
services as president of the Italian
i American Exposition In 1593.
INSULTED HIS SISTER.
Ernest Roemer Arrested for Striking
Otto Jung on the Face.
Ernest Roemer, a teamster, was arrest- !
ed yesterday on a warrant charging him
with . battery. He was released on. $100
cash bail. The complaining witness is
Otto Jung. â â 
About three weeks ago Jung was arrest- j
ed for threatening to kill Roemer's sister, ;
Marguerite. They had been engaged, but
the girl broke the engagement. Jung went |
around telling her friends that he had a j
revolver and a bottle of poison in his
pockets and he meant to kill her and him- i
self. When the case was called before j
Judge Conlan Jung promised not to annoy '
Miss Roemer again and the case was dis- i
missed.
Ernest Roemer and Jung met on Market
street Sunday afternoon and Roemer ac- j I
cused Jung of persisting in. insulting hi 3 I
sister. Hot words followed and Roemer
struck Jung on the face. Jung swore to \
the warrant for Roemer's arrest yester- ! i
day morning.

" She comes from the past and re- visits
my room ;
She looks as she did then, all beauty
and bloom,
So smiling and tender, so fresh and
so fair.
And yonder she sits in my cane-
bottomed chair."
Many a man sits silent and alone in a
home of mourning' and conjures up before
his eyes the face and form of the woman
who was once a loving wife and a faithful
helpmate. In thousands of such cases the
wife might still be alive and well and
happy, had the man been not only a good
husband, but a wise adviser. Women
shrink from the ordeal of consulting a
physician. They shudder at the thought
of submitting to the obnoxious examina-
tions insisted upon by most physicians.
In the majority of cases they have none
of this hesitancy about consulting their
husbands. A. wise man vrill understand at
once that troubles of this description will
soon break down a woman's general health.
He will understand that a specialist of emi-
nence and world wide reputation should be
frankly consulted at once. Dr. R. V. Pierce,
for thirty years chief consulting physician
to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Insti-
tute, at Buffalo, N. V., is one of the most
eminent and widely-known specialists in
the world. With the assistance of a staff
of able physicians, he has prescribed for
many thousands of ailing women. He has
discovered a wonderful medicine for wo-
men, that may be used in the privacy of
their homes. It is known as Dr. Pierce s
Favorite Prescription. It cur^s surely,
speedily and permanently, all weakness and
disease of the distinctly feminine organism.
It allays inflammation, heals ulceration,
soothes pain, gives rest to the tortured
nerves, and checks debilitating drains.

Father Dead, Mother Gone.
On October 23 Secretary W<idham of the
Eureka Society for the Protection of Chil
dren was granted letters of guardianship
over the three small children of William
Yoeman, a seafaring man whose wife ran
away with a longshoreman, i'neman was
afflicted with heart disease, and his loss
was more than the woman- for the latter,
according to his story, took with her all
of the money he had saved in many years,
amounting to $300. Yoeman was sent to
the City and County Hospital, where ha
died on Sunday. On account of the chil
dren Mr. Wadham ha* decided to stand
the expense of the old man's funeral, as
there was nothing leftafter the wife got
at the family sack. There is a warrant
out for her arrest for deserting the littlÂ«

Professional Beggar Sentenced.
William Walsh, a professional beggar,
was sent to the County Jail yesterday by
Judge Mogan for six months. He has
been in the habit of going to the secre

LIABILITY TO PAY HIS PHÅNIX BONDS
Important Documents Found Among the Records
of the Pacitic and People's Home
Banks,
History of the Methods by Which the Los Angeles
Manipulator Secured His Clutch on the
Institutions.
One of the most Interesting chapters
Jn the history of the destruction of the
Pacific Bank and the People's Home
Savings Bank Is that which relates the
introduction of M. H. Sherman to the
McDonalds and which describes the
methods employed by the crafty ma
pipulator of Phoenix and Los Angeles
in getting the coin of the banks in ex
change for his worthless securities.
Long before Sherman became a direct
or in the Pacific Bank and before he
had projected his gigantic scheme of
the Los Angeles Electric Railroad he
had induced Frank McDonald to accept
the bonds of the Phoenix Electric Rail
road in exchange for thousands and
thousands of dollars of the Pacific
Bank and the People's Bank.
In securing this money M. H. Sher
man resorted to deliberate misrepre
eentation, the most fulsome flattery
and financial trickery. These asser
tions are proved by the letters of Mr.
Sherman himself and are made only
in an incidental way to the main and
very important fact that Sherman
over his own signature became person
ally liable and responsible for the pay
tnent of the principal and interest of
these worthless bonds. This liability,
it is believed, still exists. The cocu
rnents by which Sherman made himself
personally liable are reproduced in fac
simile this morning. They may give
the depositors of the defunct banks a
lever with which to recover some of the
money that was dissipated in Sher-
Xnan's financial nightmare.
The letters that are published this
morning were written long before Sher
rnan secured in the. Pacific Bank and in
the People's Bank the tremendous pow
er he subsequently enjoyed. In the ear
lier stages of his great scheme he work
ed with the utmost deliberation, and
with the methods that have been very
thoroughly exploited before the public
secured his first thousands of dollars
from the McDonald banks. In one of
his deals he obtained $40,000 from the
Pacific Bank and gave his valueless
Phoenix railroad bonds, to which he as
signed a purely fictitious reality. When
he obtained this money, however, he
made himself personally liable for the
payment of not only the bonds but of
the interest on them to maturity. This
liability, it is claimed, still exists. A
similar responsibility and a similar con
tract exists in reference to the People's
Home Savings Bank.
EOW SHERMAN PLANNED HIS CAMPAIGN
FOR THE GOLD OF THE BANKS.
When Sherman laid his plot to get
Into the vaults of the Pacific Bank he
worked slowly, carefully and craftily
upon Frank V. McDonald, beginning
â¢with small demands and gross misrep
resentations in reference to the Phoe
nix Street Railroad. This railroad, as
Sherman himself said, was his pet
Bcheme. When he foisted upon Frank
y. McDonald the bonds of the railroad
THE GUARANTEE WHICH GAVE BOGUS PROTECTION.
Hoses H. Sherman was not satisfied with foisting his worthless Phoenix Railroad bonds upon the P*ejfie Banlc He
made a raid also upon the People's Homo Savings Bank and induced that institution to accept his valueless se
curities. In consideration of thia acceptance Sherman promised not only to guarantee the principal and interest
of Valley Street Railroad Company bonds which had already been bought by the People's Bank, but to be per
sonally liable for the payment of any of these bonds that might be bought by the bank at any time. This
agreement, part of which is given In facsimile above, was made in 1890. and is now of extreme importance to
the robbed depositors of the People's Bank.
the concern was worthless. As one of
the schemers in the bank declared, the
road began nowhere and ended no
where. Sherman was artfal, however,
in presenting in an altogether false
light the character of the road. The
following letter, which is somewhat
long will illustrate how Sherman
twisted his insidious way Into the Pa
cific Bank:
PHOENIX, Ariz., June 22, ISB9.
F V. McDonald, Cashier Pacific
Bank, San Francisco. Cal.â Dear Sir:
By to-day's expresÃ I send you ten
first mortgage bonds of the Valley
Street RailrÂ«a<l Company. This com
pany now owns all the street railway
franchises in this city, being four in
number. These franchises are for
horse cable and electric railways with
either riouble or single track, and ex
tend for fifty years. As it has been
less than one month since the consoli
dation of the different lines now com
posing this railway I cannot make a
detailed statement of receipts and ex
penses, other than to say the present
rate of earnings will produce an in
come sufficient to cover expenses of
running the line, pay interest on .
bonds and accumulate a surplus to
ward providing for that payment.
We are now operating five miles of
road with an equipment of three cars,
and have other cars paid for that will
be here soon. Everything connected
with the road and the equipment is
new and in first class order. The com
pany is out of debt and has upward of
$1000 in the treasury. This road is one
of my pet schmes, to which I am de
voting much time and energy. Our
city is growing rapidly, and this prop
erty is in consequence increasing, in
value every day. I have en route here
material for three additional miles of
track, which will soon be laid. The
company now owns twenty-one horses
and mules, all good stock, and others
will be added as needed. I write you
thus fully in accordance with your re
quest when I was in San Francisco
and sold you these bonds. With best
respects I am truly,
M. H. SHERMAN.
the McDonalds accept the worth
less BONDS OF THE PHffiNIX ROAD.
Sherman soon wrote another letter
after the foregoing had been penned.
In this second epistle he shows again
how he imposed on Frank McDonald
and the Pacific Bank with the worth
less securities of his wildcat Phoenix
property. It was through these prop
erties that Sherman wormed himself
into the confidence of the McDonalds
and slowly but surely secured his de
stroying clutch upon the banks. The
letter in part is as follows:
PHOENIX, Ariz., July 9, 1889.
â¢F. "V. McDonald Esq., cashier. Pa
cific Bank, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear
Sir: Your kind letter stating that the
$5000 had been placed to my credit in
payment for that amount of Valley
Street Railroad bonds at par is duly at
hand. At the time I sent you the
bonds I explained to you that it was
my intention to place the rest of the
issue among certain relatives and
friends of mine. To-day I have a let
ter from one of them stating that he
had $20,000 to invest and will put it in
any bonds or stock here that I will
recommend, providing that I will guar
antee that it will pay him 8 per cent
interest net. For some time we have
had a project In view here of starting
a bank at Florence, the county seat of
Pinal County.
This will be the only bank in Pinal
County, one of the richest counties in
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1898.
SHERMAN'S BAIT TO THE PACIFIC BANK.
When M H Sherman formed his great plot to secure the Pacific Bank as the backer of his worthless schemes he naturally
found thrM^DonaldTeomewhat suspicious of the value of his Phoenix projects. Frank McDonald was, however, an
easy and susceptible Bunjecr for flattery, and accepted the bonds of Sherman's Phoenix road, which was known as the
Va?l eJ Street^ RaUroad [company. In one transaction Frank McDonald gave MH. Sherman >40 000 for forty of these
Phoenix railroad bonds Frank McDonald demanded, however, that Sherman give some sort of a guarantee. The
PhS* specular d"d; 0 , but this fact was kept a profound secret until now. Sherman in his guarantee a fa* siniile
oTwhichfs given above promised to be liable for the principal and, interest of the forty bonds he had sold to the Pa
cmcÃank This liability is a personal one against M. H. Sherman, whose contract may be now of very great value in
any effort that' may be made to recover the dissipated funds of the Pacific Bank.
the Territory, and I think a very hand
some business could be worked up
there. Of course if we start this bank
you will be our San Francisco corre
spondents. You have always been
very kind and true to ub and we never
"change horses/ At one time when
I was in San Francisco you, your
brother, or your father, l forget which
told me something of your relations to
some of the savings banks in your
city. I happen to know that of late
some of the savings banks there In
your city have loaned money at ver>
low rates on security that I do ] not
believe is equal to these street railway
bonds. As I wrote you before, this is
my pet scheme. I laid out a large por
tion of what is now Phoen x and its
additions into city lots. In laying out
the streets and alleys dedicating them
to public use I reserved the exclusive
right to myself of laying down main
taining and operating all street.rail
roads whether propelled by horse,
cable or electricity. These exclusUe
rights I have deeded to the \ alley
Street â  Railway Company, and as I
wrote you before have bought up and
consolidated all the franchises.
The reason I tell you all this Is.it has
occurred to me that perhaps you
would take this ;20,000 bonds at par
and let my relatives whom I nave
mentioned as having $20,000 put it in
the Florence Bank stocK. It seems
to me that such an eight per cent
security ought to bring a handsome
premium to you when you place it. I
mall you a map of the new portion of
Phoenix (160 acres) that I own. Ii the
center of it the capital commission has
located the territorial capital. The
Valley Street Railroad owns the ex
clusive right of operating street rail

TIE PACIFIC BANK RECEIVES AN IM
PORTANT GUARANTEE FROM
SHERMAN.
The scheme of Moses H. Sherman in
reference to this worthless Valley
Street Railroad project worked far bet
ter than the crafty manipulator dared
to hope. Frank McDonald not only
bit at the bait, but swallowed Its hook
and all. While Sherman had planned
to foist $20,000 of his worthless securi
ties upon the young banker, Frank Mc-
Donald took $40,000 worth. He was
not altogether a fool, however, and he
secured from M. H. Sherman a guar
antee that may be of the greatest im
portance to the robbed depositors of the
Pacific Bank and the People's Bank.
Investigation may prove that M. H.
Sherman may be compelled to refund
$40,000 that he secured from the banks
through his wiles. When Frank Mc-
Donald took $40,000 of the first mort
gage bonds of the Valley Street Rail
road of Phoenix, Arizona, he demand
ed from M. H. Sherman and received
a guarantee that Sherman promised to
fulfill until the maturity of the bond.
Sherman promised to guarantee both
the principal and the interest of those
bonds and in this way protect the Pa
cific Bank. This guarantee is still In
existence and is in the possession or
The Call. It was made upon a letter-,
head of the Pacific Bank and is in full
as follows:
In consideration of the Pacific Bank
taking $40,000 of the first mortgage
bonds of the Valley Street Railroad of
Phoenix, Ariz.. I hereby guarantee un
til maturity of said bonds both the
principal and inter^f said bonds.
Witness: F. V. McDONALD.
PROTECTION PROMISED IN EXCHANGE
FOR DANGEROUS SPECULATION.
Sherman not only foisted his Valley
Street Railroad bonds on the Pacific
Bank, but he succeeded âso in palm
ing off a large quantity upon the Peo
ple's Home Savings Bank. The Mc-
Donalds were as careful in this in
stance, however, as they had been in
the case of the Pacific Bank. They
exacted from Sherman a promise which
is a legal agreement that he would per
sonally guarantee the principal and in
terest of the Valley Street Railroad
bonds to the People's Home Savings
Bank. This guarantee may be of vital
importance to the creditors of the de
funct institution and may be the means
of recovering some of the money thai
was sent out of the bank into Sher
man's Phoenix speculation, i'he docu
ment is in the possession of The Call.
The importance of the paper warrants
its publication In full as follows:

ThlÂ», la my Judgment, makes it very.
valuable property and I have great
faith in its future. Mr. Sherman, the
president of the company and the
owner of a majority of the stock, is,
as you know, a personal friend of mine
and a gentleman of wonderful energy
and a very successful business man.
While I am not in a position to know
from personal observation anything of
the earnings or expenses of the road,
yet I am informed by Mr. Sherman
that the profits of the Valley Street
Railroad are at a rate sufficient to
pay the operating expenses, interest on
bonds, and that the business is grow
ing in volume from week to week. This
city, as you are aware, is in 4ts infan
cy, and we are quite sanguine that it
is destined to be the San Francisco of
Arizona. If so the value of street rail
roads in this cfty can hardly be over
estimated. From what I know of the
enterprise and of the strong growth of
our city and valley I feel confident in
recommending these bonds as a safe
and profitable investment for investors.
Yours truly, W. J. MURPHY.
SHERMAN'S GUILTY SECRETS MADE HTM
TREMBLE AT THREATENED
BLACKMAIL.
As already indicated Sherman ingra
tiated himself into the confidence of
the McDonalds through the most abject
and most nauseating sycophancy. There
was no flattery too coarse nor too
cringing nor too base that he did not
employ while he was trying to blind
Dick McDonald's eyes and open his
money bags. Sherman was one of the
first who was shrewd enough to see
that Dick McDonald's predominating
weakness was egotism. The coarser
the flattery, the balder the compliment
the better Dick liked it. It was one
of the young banker's demands that
every one of his agents and sycophants
should write him a letter every day.
Most of them did so and Sherman cer
tainly did not overlook so important a
point in his campaign to get into the
vaults of the Pacific Bank over the
eilly head of Dick McDonald. Sherman
very frequently neglected to date his
letters.
The only way in which the time
of their composition can be approxi
mately estimated is to see whether
Sherman metaphorically is crawling at
Dick's feet or showing his teeth to the
young banker. If he was in the crawl
ing attitude the letter was written
when he wanted money. If he was
showing his teeth the letter was penned
after he had obtained money and
wanted to get rid of Dick. The follow
ing letter, in which "Jayhawker" again
appears as a bitter enemy of Sherman,
may be placed in the flattery period of
the correspondence:
Monday, a. m.
My Dear Friend: I am just writing
Christy to please deposit a lot of coin
â¢with your New York correspondent.
It will make me so happy if this goes
and he deposits this money with you.
You have been so true and kindâfor
give my annoying you from day to day
with so many lettersâ only I wanted
you to know all. This nasty stuff of
''Jayhawkers" amounts to nothing as
all know him. Since Colonel Otis fired
him out of Times office he is powerless.
All the San Francisco papers know
this so they will publish either. Colon
nel Otis and others have figured it
out that this man has blackmailed
people out of (through his connection
with the Times) over $6000. His stock
in trade is lost now that the Times
has fired him. You see he could use
the Associated Press and had power
then. Still I suppose he will try and
keep it up (his persecution) until he
finds that he cannot get coin out of
us and then he will try some one else,
eh? whom he finds more gullible. He
tried to Bcare me by trying to make
me think that you and Mr. Johns had
told things. Said he had a list of
all I owed you and etc. What he wants
is to try and get us quarreling among
ourselves, eh? He has caught on to
Mr. Mitchell and Is trying to pump
him. I do hope Mr. Mitchell will be
ware of him and not talk with him.
It is almost impossible to talk with
him and not have him guess some
thing of one's business. The way I
do is to not affirm and not deny any
thing. Let him do the talking. You
are so much wiser and know so much
better what is what than I. Still I
want t6 tell you all I learn In these
matters and all my hopes and fears,
and it is my duty to let you know.
Isn't it? All that comes up if it is good
or bad, eh? Any time you want me to
stop boring you with these long let
ters Just tell me and I will quit. Hop
ing you will be so careful of your
health and not work too hard and
please don't worry over this fellow's
nasty lies. Sincerely, M. H.
P. S.â Mr. Johns writes me that "Jay
hawker" tried to make him and you
think I had leaked things. I write Mr.
Johns that that is just what "Jay
hawker" told me of himself and of
you. Funny stuff. I never leak.
Every day I try to be more careful.
ANOTHER FORTUNE TO BE SUNK IN THE
PHffiNIX WATER WORKS.
The following letter will illustrate
Sherman's method of getting more
money out of Dick. The schemer of
Los Angeles wanted $75,000 more for the
Phoenix Water Company, which proved
subsequently to be such a disastrous
undertaking to the Pacific Bank:
Monday, a. m.
My Dear Friend: I went out yester
day to meet the train from Phoenix
and Mr. Fabyan. He seemed to think
well of our proposition for him to buy
the works at Phoenix. He did not say
sure. Now, If Mr. Fabyan and his
friends put this stock in their name,
and he takes the presidency and puts
his man in charge there (he thinks
the thing to do is to use 250 of the new
6 per cent bonds to pay oft the pres
ent issues and $10,000 for excess and
175.000 to add to and improve the plant,
and leave the rest In the treasury for
future improvements, I. c. the rest of
the 500 boniis). His family is so rich
and powerful and stands so high.
Don't you think if he pays you this
$94,000 In cash you can do as I indicat
ed in my letter of last Thursday and
sign that option? He thinks he can
have you your $94,000 in ninety days'
time. It seems a rare chance to get a
powerful man in charge and responsi
ble to pay all. If this goes O. K. he
thinks he will take hold of the Phoe
nix street railroad. It would make me
bo happy to get you all the money.
Please wire or write me. Train time.
On run. M. H.
The Call will continue to-morrow
morning the publication of the Interest-
Ing letters of M. H. Sherman. It will
show that Mr. Sherman pictured him
self as a lobbyist at Sacramento- and a
corrupter of State officials, one of
whom, he jubilantly remarked, was ex-
Attorney General W. H. H. Hart. In
the gigantic scheme to maintain the
tottering banks on their unsafe founda
tion M. H. Sherman resorted to any
measure, honest or dishonest, that was
necessary for success. There is some
thing more than a passing diversion in
his reference to the Southern Pacific
Company and to certain newspapers In
this city.
IMAGINARY WRONGS
DROVE TO DEATH
JOHN GASKIN PUTS A BULLET
IN HIS HEART.
In Letters He Accuses Wealthy Men
of Defrauding Him of Con
siderable Money.
John B. Gaskin. formerly In the employ
of the Metropolitan Match Company,
committed suicide at the corner of San
some and Clay street about fifteen min
utes past 10 o'clock last evening by shoot
ing himself through the heart. Despon
dency over his penniless condition and the
loss of money of which he believed he had
been robbed by his former employers,
Henry W. Newbauer and C. F. Leige, evi
dently caused a derangement of the man's
mind and his self-destruction was the re
sult.
In the pockets of Gaskin's clothing were
found a number of letters bearing dates,
ranging from October 6 to yesterday, ad
dressed to Newbauer, Leige, M. C. Has
sett, an attorney in the Phelan building,
and Thomas O'Connor of Alameda, In
the letters to Newbauer and Leige he
pleaded with them to "make amends for
the wrong they did him back in 1885 and
pay him the $1200 which they owed him."
O'Connor he claimed had defrauded Jiim
of $100, and HasÃett he asked to re
store the estate which was due him.
Mr. Newbauer, who was formerly the
president of the Metropolitan Match Com
pany and at present owns stock in the
corporation, was seen last night and de
nies that Gaskin has any claim on the
company. "Gaskin worked for us on a
commission several years ago," said Mr.
Newbauer, "and when he left our employ
claimed that we were indebted to him.
The case was taken to court and a deci
sion was given in our favor. Since that
time we have received a number of letters
from him demanding the money and these
we have ignored. Mr. Leige, I believe,
has had letters from the man recently,
but I have received none. Gaskin was a
bad character and has figured Â»in the
courts several times on criminal charges,
and has I believe served a jail sentence.
At different times he had trouble with his
wife and once fired a pistol at her."
An incoherent letter to the Coroner was
in a memorandum book in {he man's pock
et. The first portion of it was dated last
Wednesday, but additions were made to
it nearly every hour from that day up to
10 o'clock last night. He recounted the
wrongs he believed had been done him,
and decared the deed which he was about
to commit would fully revenge him for
the evil done him by his enemies. In this
letter he stated that papers substantiating
his claims would be found in his trunk at
1169 Mission street, and he begged the
Coroner to see that he got justice after
death, even if it had been denied him dur
ing his life.
According to this diary Gaskin left his
room at 10 o'clock last night penniless
and with no possessions but two revol
vers. Fifteen minutes after this last entry
Police Officers Connors and Silver heard
a shot and found his dead body lying on
the jiJewalk.

tor Perkins upheld the negative side and
closed the debate. ,
On being introduced to the audience Mr.
Shortridge stated that his main reasons
for advocating the retention of the Is
lands was because of their commercial
value, and secondly, because he believed
it was the duty of this country to civil
ize them. He began by showing how the
United States had grown to greatness
from a small beginning and cited the fact
that our most valuable pessessions to
day were those that we had purchased,
such as Louisiana from France, Califor
nia from Mexico and Alaska from Rus-
Along this line he said that some day
we would see that Hawaii, recently an
nexed, would prove one of the Govern
ment's most valuable possessions. Mr.
Shortridge stated .that there were four
points of view from which the United
States would be benefited by keeping the
Philippines. They were, first, San Fran
cisco; secondly, this coast; third, the
other States, and fourthly, the Govern
ment at large. He cited the fact that
no nation can be Â«rreat without wealth,
and that greatness was only to be ac
quired by material possession. The keep
ing of these islands he thought would in
crease our revenues. Aside from a com
mercial point of view this nation had
taken a stand and could not afford to
turn back now. He declared that we
owned something to humanity and that
it was our duty to advance the cause <'f
liberty. Mr. Shortridge stated that If
these islands were at the disposal of any
other nation, as they are now at ours,
there was no nation that would not keep
them.
Senator Perkins began his argument by
saying that the question of keeping the
Philippines was a judicial one, and one
that had to be carefully considered, as it
was possible for this Government to do
a great wrong in annexing the Islands.
He then dived for a time into statistics,
showing that the islands were 7000 miles
from this coast, fourteen hundred in
number and that only nine of them are
inhabitable, the remainder being barren
and volcanic. The main and strongest
reason brought out by the Senator
against the keeping of the Philippines
was that it was impossible for the Anglo-
Saxon race to live there. Nature, he said,
had declared against it. The humidity of
the atmosphere is such that for six hours
In each day the white man can not go
out of doors, while th^ effect is that of
taking a Russian bath.
The speaker showed the low and de
graded state of the natives, and said that
it we annexed the Philippines thtse peo
ple would become natives on an equal
with our best citizens here. He spoke of
the ravages of yellow fever and cholera,
the typhoon* and earthquakes and the
many other disadvantages that have to
be encountered. Senator Perkins said that
it was not a question of our bravery that
deterred the nation, but that It was a
question of right. We did not go into
this war for territorial acquisition, but
In behalf of liberty, and that having done
what we set out to do, it was our duty
as soon as the people had established
their government to withdraw our flag.
If we took the Islands we would have
to subdue the natives.
These and many more difficult questions
will be continually rising and calling for
careful consideration. As for the reve
nue, he said it would cost more to col
lect than it amounted to. and that there
would also be the additional expense of
the navy that would have to be kept
there.
HENRY MARTxN CANED.
Beautiful Presentation to the Popular
Sheriff-Elect by His Friends.
At a banquet held in the apartments of
Mr. and Mrs. Jerome Deasy last night
Henry Martin, the popular and ponderous
Sheriff-elect, was the guest of honor and

behalf of the Native Sons and Daughters'
booth of the late Holy Cross Church fair
It was won by the redoubtable Henry in
a contest for the most popular candidate
for Sheriff by 138 votes over his next high
est opponent, and was but a precursor of
his later brilliant victory at the polls. Mr,
M-artln responded feelingly to the tribute
and his health was drunk in many bump
ers of sparkling wine.
Those present to do him honor were
Mrs. Frank Dunne. Mrs. Charles Capp.
Mrs. Lizzie Batturs, Mr. and Mrs. Jerome
Deasy, Grattan Phillips. D. C. Martin. J.

There ie relief from periodical
backaches, headaches and nervous-

for you In my simple method. Don't
take any more drugs. They only
stimulate for a day. You must re-

can cure you. Medicines are good
for some troubles, but they do not
restore strength. Electricity does,
and the best means of using it is my
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
I have found that my now famous

LET US HAVE RAIN.
CALIFORNIA has been through one dry sea
son, and only a State so well equipped with
varied industries and so vast in extent could
so well have borne the calamity. Yet there is a limit
even to the endurance of California. People. are hop
ing and praying there will not be this year a continu
ation of the drought. They want the baked fields
flooded, the lean kine given grass wherewith to lay
fat on their protuberant ribs. They yearn for the
orchards to bloom again and bear fruit, the dust of
the vineyard to be laid. They desire to get soaked,
saturated and half-drowned. It is not a shower they
ask for, but a procession of showers with such short
iitervals between as shall barely give them oppor
tunity to wring themselves out.
So far as can be learned, the only ones who would j
not hail rain as a blessing are the beautiful but per- ]
haps thoughtless ladies who have provided themselves j
with the prevalent picture hat whereon waves a
wealth of plumes, the glory of which is impaired by a ;
good fog and utterly departs in the presence of a |
downpour.* But the ladies would join in the general |
petition and graciously joy in having the plumes be
draggled could they but realize how the man who
paid for the millinery pines for rain, and the chances \
that unless the rain come next year they may have to j
wear gingham sunbonnets and sell the feathers to
buy shoes for the baby.
In other words. California must have rain. The
weather is lovely now. Within the human breast it
arouses a spirit of poesy. The little birds are satisfied
with it. The person who does not think deeply nor
see beyond the end of his nose believes it is all right.
On the contrary, it is all wrong. Lowering clouds
might drive the comeliness from the landscape and
interfere with Sunday picnics, but they would tickle
the soil, and later in the deal render glad the heart
of man, which cannot forever be made buoyant by a
ray of sunshine and a gentle breeze.
THE SILVER DEMOCRATS.
HARD indeed-have been the times for the Silver
Democrats, and harder still are going to be the
times that awjait them. Even fortune, which
is proverbially said to favor fools, seems to have for
saken them. They have gained nothing from the last
campaign, not even the wholesome benefit of a sound
thrashing, for their pet issue was not permitted to
have a place in the game.
The free silver craze will take rank hereafter as one :
of the most extraordinary forms of political lunacy '
that ever affected the mind of any considerable num- ;
ber of the American people. It was the madness of I
an hour and has so far spent its force that even its I
stanchest advocates never dared to defend it or hardly
eten to refer to it on any stump in the United States.
It was ignored like a poor relation, hushed up like an
indiscretion and kept out of sight like a skeleton in
a closet.
The few Republicans who were carried away by it
are not so badly off, for they did not contaminate the
fold. They have only to repent, come back, be for- I
given, and they will find once more a secure shelter. ,
The Populists have only to return to the middle of the ;
road, and they also will have a future for themselves.
The free silver Democrat, however, has no resource
left. He has despoiled the house of his fathers. He !
has no longer a place of refuge even should he re- !
pent; neither has he a road to which to betake him- j
self. There is nothing left for him but the woods or |
the grave.
Fortune as well as fate, caprice as well as reason,
have taken part in reducing the Silver Democrat to
utter* nothingness. Every event of the time, every
prospect of the future militates against him. Logic ;
has refuted his arguments, prosperity has destroyed
the discontent which was his strength, and popular
favor has deserted him. Even in the social swim the ;
girls mock at him. He is out of date. There may i
be some sort of future for the Silver Democrat, but
never for that cause nor under that name will Ameri
can politics ever know him again.
Roosevelt is said to have an eye on the White
House. There is no particular harm in this. Many
another gentleman has focused his optics in the same
direction without getting beyond the stage of doing
all his gazing from the outside of the structure.
Colonel Smith of the First California will be
pleased to learn that the President has praised the
troops of his command. Other colonels have found
ir a more substantial way that their services were ap
preciated.
Li Hung Chang bobs up and down like a cork in
the surf, but whether he is up or down the people of
this country are just as much concerned as about the
fate of the cork.
THE RfICE RIOTS.
THERE are ten millions of negroes in the
United States. The amended constitution gives
them equality of civil rights and the franchise.
Whether this gift to a long-subject race were wise or
unwise need not be discussed now. The act if a fact
and must be reckoned with as a fact.
It is a fact, too, that is full of present and future
j portent. The result of our war with Spain is to give
Cuba a negro government, ii she is to be self-govern
irg at all. After the Spaniards have withdrawn three
fourths of the people left will be negroes and their
congeners. We have sent negro regiments of our
regular army as a significant part of our invading
force to expel Spain from the island. These black
regulars have risen in the Ecale of intelligence by the
drill, discipline and esprit de corps of the army. They
return with their commands to their own country to
find their race denied here the independence and equal
ity which thej- fought to gain for it in Cuba. They find
a stubborn rejection of the negro as a voter and an
office-holder, while he is called on as a soldier to
bleed and die for these very rights of his people
abroad. The situation is startling." It cannot be met
by shutting our eyes to it. Children afraid of the
dark shut their eyes, but that does not end the dark
ness.
The leaders of the Cuban insurgents have been ne
groes. Maceo was of that race, and Gomez is a San
Domingo negro. Seen through the lens of our own
situation the insurrection in Cuba appears every day
more clearly as a race war.
Are we on the verge of such a war at home? If
a Maceo or a Gomez arise in the South, at the head of
an armed force, proclaiming to the world that they
are ready to wade through slaughter to get the full
rights guaranteed to them by the constitution of the
United States, what answer can we make to them
and to the world?
We do not say that white men. when they are in sr
minority in any State, must submit patiently to the
rule of a black majority. We do not say that States
can progress and prosper in this country under such
rule. But we do say that the Federal constitution
gives to a negro majority, everywhere in the republic,
the right to cast its vote, have it fairly counted and
take and exercise the power and authority which that
vote gives.
Armed intervention to establish a black govern
i ment in Cuba has been like a sun glass focused on
! tinder throughout the South. The whites have met
i the issue with a relentless firmness. Any of them
| who have not aligned with their race have been for
| cibly exiled from their homes and are driven out of
i any community in which they seek refuge. These
j events are indicative of the desperate nature of the
j conflict. What are we going to do about it? Having
i gone abroad to enfranchise the inferior races, are we
going to disfranchise an inferior race at home, and
leave standing in the constitution the great guarantee
of its civil and political equality? The issue concerns
the whites and blacks in thirteen States, but in the
broader view it affects our national attitude before
the world and the soundness of our own fundamental
law. The Spanish war has afforded only one point
upon which to impinge hope of a reasonable solution.
The former sectional feeling and prejudice between
North and South have been destroyed. There is no
longer standing room for it in the fear that, touching
the great purposes of the Union, the South and North
are in discord.
The race problem is separated entirely from the
former sectional i*sue. As related to that it is a new
problem entirely. The white leaders of the North ana
South must face each other calmly, without passion,
and discuss that problem and settle it.
The progressive consolidation of the Government,
the prospective completion of that process as a re
sult of our brief war. may point the way. Under a
consolidated Federal Government will disappear the
effect of a local black majority in Alabama, Missis
sippi, Louisiana and South Carolina. The question
in this new aspect will be between a white majority of
70,000,000 and a black minority of 10,000,000 in a con
solidated nation, under a highly centralized Govern
ment.
This implies the surrender by the South, and by
our people everywhere, of the last vestige of State
rights as founded in the Virginia and Kentucky reso
lutions of 1798 and 1799. This surrender is likely to
bt the crux of the whole question. If the centralizing
revolution is turned back by aversion to that change
the further Question arises as to the extent to which
Congress can go under its constitutional grant of
power to guarantee to each State a republican form
of government. That form is well settled, under our
system, to mean a government in which the majority
rules by lawful expression of its will at the ballot
box.
These are the alternatives. They must be consid
ered. The issue must be met. It must be settled. If
it is not we will run into the deepest difficulties that
have /.yet beset the republic, and their burden will be
greater because of the sentiment and principle upon
which we made war upon Spain and the results
which have followed our victory.
THE PRESIDENT AND IMPERIALISM.
WITH a persistent iteration the expansionists
and imperialists of the yellow press assert and
reassert that the President is determined upon
the annexation of the Philippines and will exert all
the powers of his great office to accomplish it. It
has been even said that he will organize the admin
istration Republicans of the House into an opposition
to the election of Reed as Speaker during the next
Congress, because Mr. Reed is not in favor of im
perialism. In short, the yellow organs claim to b
spokesmen for the President. They proclaim wit!
so much impudence what he is going to do that
considerable number of people are no doubt misle<
by their statements.
So widespread have been these reports that Senato
Hoar found it necessary' in a recent speech at Worces
ter to remind his hearers that there is no authority
under the constitution of the United States to ac
quire any foreign territory save by treaty approved
by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, or by an act of
legislation in which the President, the Senate and
the House of Representatives must unite. He added:
"It is just as well to bear this fact in mind when
reading some of the remarkable dispatches in which
wiseacres in Paris (as correspondents for American
newspapers) profess to be able to outline the policy
of the United States."
President McKinley has had a large experience i
politics, and is a statesman of known conservatism
and sagacity. He is not at all likely to attempt t
domineer over Congress nor to try to dictate th
choice of Speaker of the House. His policy will b
announced in due time. He is not using the yellow
journals as his organs nor even as his confidants.
Whether the Senate will approve of the annexation
of the Philippines remains to be seen. The more the
subject is studied and understood the less inclined
are the people to undertake the venture. As the Bos
ton Transcript says:
"Whatever may have been public sentiment at the
time of the first news of Dewey's great victory, it may
THE SAN FRAM CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1898.
seriously be doubted to-day whether the American
people want to engage in a tropical campaign of four
or five years' duration, carried on solely with a view
to the conquest of 9,000,000 Malays who are now
roaming in savagery in an archipelago which includes
about 2000 islands, over which the taint of disease
hangs constantly, a menace of death to any invading
force of white men."
THE LATEST SCHOOL SCfiNDfIL.
THE light and airy manner in which certain
members of the Board of Education have re
ceived the charges of John P. Reynolds, who
has sworn that they were bribed to award a lease of
the Lincoln School lots to the San Francisco Real
Estate Investment Company, indicates that they do
not understand the gravity^of the situation in which
they are placed. Reynolds has commenced a suit to
recover the amount Snook and Williams agreed to
pay him for his services in negotiating the business.
In that action the particulars of the entire affair may
become legal evidence. In other words, a defense will
have to be made and established or Reynolds will re
cover judgment.
Under these circumstances it will not do for the
accused parties to declare that Reynolds drinks, bor
rows money and is generally a disreputable character.
Some evidence will have to be produced to offset his
sworn statement, that: (1) Sam Waller received
$5000 for "fixing" the Board of Education; that (2)
somebody "jumbled" the advertisement for tenders;
that (3) the insurance on the buildings covering the
lots was reduced by trickery; that (4) bad tenants
were ejected for the benefit of the lessees; that (5)
a sewer was put in under Phil Crimmins' saloon be
fore the award was made; and (6) that the bond of the
Real Estate Investment Company was scaled.
All these things are matters of record. On fheir
face they look bad, though we do not say they cannot
be explained. Certainly, in the teeth of such charges
and such a record it will not do for Waller, Snook,
Williams and their associates to aver that Reynolds
drinks and borrows money. If Mr. Waller and his
alleged "business" colleagues in the Board of Edu
cation are guilty of having sold the lease of the Lin
coln School lots in this way they have committed a
crime which has attached to it a State prison penalty.
Moreover, the lease itself is void and may be an
nulled.
Nor is this a Grand Jury case. The suit brought
by Reynolds is a civil action, and the suit to annul
the lease, if one be commenced, will be a civil action.
Evidence may be taken in both which it will.be im
possible hereafter to refute or obliterate.
Mr. Snook was secretary of the Grand Jury when
he is alleged to have conceived the idea of organiz
ing the San Francisco Real Estate Investment Com
pany, and he probably knows how futile prosecu
tions of official rascals are before that body; hence
his experienced judgment will tell him at once that
the investigation which now confronts Director Wai- j
ler's associates is not to be compared with a Grand ;
Jury comedy.
If the accused School Directors desire to clear j
themselves they should explain why the advertisement i
for leasing the school lots was "jumbled." why the
insurance on the buildings was reduced, why the j
lessee's bond was scaled and why Snook's company \
paid Jake Samuels a $5000 fee for services which 1
should not have cost over $500. AH these matters j
will have to be explained before the people will be
justified in acquitting the School Board ring.
REPUBLICAN COUNTY COMMITTEE.
BEFORE the events of the recent election are
forgotten in the approach of Thanksgiving and
the rush of holiday trade, it is but just that due
credit should be given by the victorious Republicans
to the masterly work accomplished in the local cam
paign by the County Central Committee. This work
is too important to be overlooked even in the rejoic
ing over the larger victories in the State and in the
nation. It merits general recognition.
The local campaign opened under threatening cir
cumstances. The Democrats were in power, and had
at their head a Mayor entrenched in office and with
an autocratic control of all the machinery of his
party. He was also supported by a Non-Partisan
organization, which at the beginning of the canvass
was supposed to represent a considerable voting
strength. . Against such odds the Central Committee
had to make headway without any of the adventitious
aids which favored the Phelanites.
The county convention nominated a strong ticket,
and with that one factor in their favor the committee
went to work. The task of organizing the party and
rousing the ardor of the rank and file was undertaken
with vigor and energy. In a comparatively short
time a new aspect was given to the situation. Repub
licanism was united and Democracy divided. The
work of the committee began to tell. Activity took
the place of despondency, and the hopes of "the party
became sanguine.
The results of the contest speak for themselves and
attest the excellence of the tactics adopted by the
party managers. The victory of the Republicans in
the city and county was almost a clean sweep. In
stead of giving a majority of 10,000 for Maguire, as
the Democrats had predicted, the city gave a hand
some majority for Gage. The Board of Supervisors,
the Board of Education and almost all the important
offices of the county were won for the Republican
candidates.
The members of the County Committee can well
be satisfied with the proof thus given of the sagacity
and energy of their conduct of the canvass. They
achieved a sweeping success where defeat /was threat
ened, and have a right to a large share of the honors
of the splendid campaign which resulted so bril
liantly for San Francisco Republicanism:'
If President Valentine of the Wells-Fargo Express
Company can induce California courts, as has been
done in the East, to hold that when Congress said ex
press companies should pay a share of the \var tax,
it did not know what it was talking about, ht will
have been recompensed for all the trouble he has had
ir. writing tracts on the subject.
Residents of a city not blessed with a morally and
physically reeking Chinatown cannot appreciate the
difficulty of apprehending a Chinese murderer. This
is about as hard a job as to enter a sewer full of rats
and catch the rodent guilty of nibbling a particular
cheese.
All this talk about the Spanish making renewed
resistance is a waste of patience, time, breath and
space. They may feel in the mood, but have nothing
to make it with.
There should be a rigid investigation of the rumors
concerning the cruiser Buffalo. The people of this
country do not want any "hell ships" in the navy.
New York soldiers are to be called back from
Honolulu. They have not found military life a pic
ric, and a picnic was what they were looking for.
The campaign is over, but the hospital is still full
of political cripples.

WHEN PAPA'S SICK.
When papa's sick, my goodness sakes!
Biich awful, awful times ft makes,
lie speaks in oh: such lonesome tones,
And gives such ghas'ly kind of groans,
And rolls his eyes and holds his head,
And makes ma help him up to bed;
While Sis and Bridget run to heat
Hot water bag's to warm his feot.
And I must get the doctor quick â
We have to jump when papa's sick.
When papa's sick ma has to stand
Right side the bed and hold his hand,
V'hile Sis she has to fan an' fan.
For he says he's "a dyln' man."
And wants the children round him to
Be there when "sufferin' pa gets
through";
He says he wants to say good-by
And kiss us all and then ho'll die;
Then moans and says his "breathln's
thick"â
It's awful sad when papa's sick.
When papa's sick he acts that way
Until he hears the doctor say.
"You've only got a cold, you know,
You'll be all right 'n a day or so."
And thenâ well, say! you ought to see,
He's different as he can be.
And growls and swears from noon to
night
Just 'cause his dinner ain't cooked right.
And all he does is fuss and kick â
We're al! used un when papa's sick.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
PETITION TO PROBATE-M. E. P..
City. Any interested party, devisee or
lfgatee or executor, may, in the State of
California, petition to have a will pro
bated.
NATIONAL GUARDâ T. H., Placerville.
Cai. The State of California does not, in
time of peace, allow the members of the
National Guard any money except the
monthly allowance for armory rent, etc.
They are only given pay when called into
service.
BETTING ON ELECTIONâ The Ad
mirer, City. The section of the Code that
prohibits betting on elections is still a
part of the Penai Code of the State of
California. This department not being
the custodian of the minds of those
whose duty it Is to enforce the law cannot
inform you why that law is not enforced.
A YOUNG WRITERâ B. M. S., City.
A young writer who wishes to have his
articles criticized should form the ac
quaintance of some well known literary
man who has the time and inclination and
submit his articles to him. Nov.spapefs
all over the United States accept well
written, newsy items.
DRAUGHT OF A VESSEI^N.. City,
'"his department has not been able to
find a record of a vessel drawing thirty
six feet of water. There are some war
vessels that have great draught, for in
stance the Italia and the I^epanto of the
Italian navy draw thirty-one feet of
â water.
A FIVE-CENT PIECEâ J. 11 C, City.
A copper nickel five-cent piece of 1869 hav
ing on the reverse the figure 5 In a circle
of alternate stars and rays, with the
words cents underneath, and the legend
United States of America above, sells at
from twenty-five to forty cents, accord-
Ing to condition.
POLL TAXâ N. N.. City. The States in
which women are allowed full suffrage
are Colorado. Utah and Wyoming.
Women pay poll tax only in Wyoming.
The law of Utah and Colorado says that

ing the law is that "every person shall
pay poll tax." In each of these States
there is a limit to age when poll tax shall
ceaee.
TRESPASS BY ANIMALSâ L. H., Oat
Hill, Cal. The art of March 27, 1897. In
relation to taking up estrays says that
an individual may take up estrays on his
property or on the highway adjacent
thereto, and makes no mention of fences.
From this it is to be inferred that ani
mals that stray upon the property of any
one in this State, whether the same is
fenced or not, ran be taken up and held
according: to law.. There is a law that
deals with animals tha\ enter upon lands
that are fenced.
PROBATING A WILLâ V. J. T., Jamul,
Cal. If the party was a resident of Jamul
at the time of his death, though he died
in San Francisco, the will should be pro
bated in San Diego County, in which
Jamul is located; but if he was a resident
of San Francisco at the time of death,
the will must be "probated in S.'vn Francis
co. A resident of Jamul can have the will
presented in San Francisco through an
attorney, but when it comes to proving
the will it would require the presence of
the party offering the will for probate, if
the party is an interested one.
PROVING UP A HOMESTEAD-M.,
Carson City, Nev. The letter of Inquiry
is not sufficiently definite to warrant a
positive answer, as it does not appear
what steps were taken to prove the home
stead, but the rule is, where a homestead
pettier dies before the completion of hia
dafm the widow or in case of her death
the heirs may continue settlement or cul
tivation and obtain title upon proper
proof at the right time. If the widow
proves up, the title passea to hej. If she
dies before proving up, and the heirs
make the proof, t}tle will vest in them.
The facts stated in the letter of Inquiry
are not sufficiently set forth .to show if
there was any fraud practiced in the
proving up.
WILL PAY FOR
GAS OVER THE
MAYOR'S VETO
Supervisors Stand by
the Corporation.
VOTE FOR A FREE MARKET
A LIVELY SESSION IN WHICH
THE BOARD GOES IT ALONE.
Permits Granted for Two Boxing
Contests â People's Mutual Tel
ephone Company Gets
an Extension.
By a vote of seven to three yesterday
the Board of Supervisors overruled the
veto of the Mayor and allowed the Au
gust and September bills of the Gas and
Electric Company amounting in the ag
gregate to $48,842 86. The bills came up
in the regular order of business, and Su
pervisor Rottanzi got up to say that he
had looked into the law upon which
Mayor Phelan had based his veto of Oc
tober 7 and he found no reason for beat
ing the gas company out of what was
justly due it. The company had fur
nished the goods, he said, and there was
no reason why payment should longer be
delayed, the Mayor to the contrary not
withstanding.
Supervisor Rottanzi was the principal
object of attack in Mayor Phelan's veto.
HiÃ two objections to allowing the com
pany's claims were that the contract with
the gas and electric people had been en
tered into in spite of his veto, and that
the man who cast the deciding vote was
Supervisor Rottanzi, who at that time
was not only drawing salary as a Su
pervisor but was holding a lucrative posi
tion under the Government as a surgeon
of volunteers. This, the Mayor contended,
was contrary to the law, and his veto is
sued accordingly. Supervisor Rottanzi's
championship of the motion to pass was
decidedly aggressive in tone, but he suc
ceeded in eliciting no reply from the
Mayor, who quietly put the vote. The
only noes were Supervisors Dodge, Clin
ton and Lackmann, and the bills passed.
Another step was taken toward the es
tablishing of the free market on the water
front in a resolution granting to the Har
bor Commissioners the right to use the
one and three-quarter blocks bounded by
East, Davis and Pacific streets as a site
for tf\e sheds, railroad terminals and
other conveniences needed for the re
ceiving and display of all produce shipped
from the country for marketing. The res
olution passed without objection.
The petition to close, by the erection of
a building, the cul de sac known as Ash
burton place, between Post and Sutter
streets, again occupied the attention of
the board, and Supervisor Rottanzi
strongly objected to permission being
granted as the city was to receive no in
demnity. He was seconded in his objec
tions by Supervisor Clinton, and when the
matter came to a vote it stood at five to
five. Supervisor Britt changed his vote
from aye to no and gave notice that at
the next meeting he would move to recon
sider the vote.
An amendment to section 50 of the or
dinance regulating offensive advertising
was referred, upon motion of Supervisor
Hasklns, to the Police Committee, 'me
amendment prohibits the pasting of cir
culars or advertising matter of any de
scription upon electric light and telephone
poles. It has- the unanimous sanction of
the boaru.
Observant of the fact that the Hall of
Justice is finally nearing completion, the
board also adopted a resolution directing
the Committee on Public Buildings to
gather necessary information relative -to
furnishing the new building. No time was
set for the hearing of the committee's re
port.
James L. Crittenton of the People's Mu
tual Telephone Company appeared before
the board to urge the request made at a
previous meeting for another extension of
one year in the time granted the company
under its franchise to complete its sys
tem. T'pon the promise that all of the ca
bles and wires in the business center of
the city would be laid underground, the
extension was granted.
By the unanimous vote of the board, a
resolution was adopted directing the City
and County Attorney to represent the city
In the suit brought by H. Julius Conradt
for an injunction restraining the Board of
Supervisors from entering into a contract
with the Sanitary Reduction Company lor
the incineration of garbage gathered on
the city's streets.
Permits were granted to the National
Athletic Club for a boxing contest, to
occur between December 20 and 31, and
to the Atlas Amateur Athletic Club for
a contest at B'nai B'rlth Hall, to take
place on the 28th inst. In the case of the
Atlas Club the license for fistic exhibi
tions was suspended, as the contest is to
be an amateur performance and not for
the purpose of raising revenue.
Another batch of claims for the paving
of Market street was brought up and the
bills were passed to be printed. Among
thorn were those of City Improvement
Company for paving Market street, oe
tween Second and Sixth, for $13,716 tÂ»;
Fourth street, between Market and Mis
sion, $1148 55; Bryant street, between
Twenty-second and Twenty-thiru. $786 85;
for repairs during September, $1718 04;
Fllnn & Treacy, paving Market street,
$7304 6").
After establishing a half dozen street
lights on south of Market street corners,
the board adjourned to Monday next.

The wnrk of raising the sunken steam
er J. D. Peters is progressing favorably.
She has been got up on the beach as
far as the wreckers require and yesterday
the bulkheads were completed. An at
tempt was to be made to pump her out at
low water, but the chances are that more
â work will have to be done before the yes-
Bel will float. It is safe to say, however,
that in a day or so she will be on her way

On the return trip she will bring back 500

up the soldiers the Australia will have to
leave behind her banana cargo, so there
is likely to be a shortage of that fruit
next month.

The steam schooner Albion has gone to j
Oakland Creek to lie up while new boilers
J are being built for her. The Inspectors of j
Hulls and Boilers have cut her steam

not sufficient to take her up the coast.
The quarantine steamer Governor Per- \

HE IS WORSHIPED BY
AN UNKNOWN BEAUTY
Actor Hastings Anxious to Discover the Sender of
Tender Missives and Valuable Gifts,
ERNEST HASTINGS, the jeunne premier of the Alcazar, is striving to
lead a better, nobler life. Ho no longer smokes, wears the blue badge of
temperance pinned to the lapel of his new Tuxedo and eschews with a
touching persistency the jolly companionship of his erstwhile friends. Only
the man or woman who might pose with a perfect consistency as the hero
or heroine of a Sunday school tale now receives the nod of recognition
from the handsome leading man.
There is method in Hastings' apparent madness. The thespian is boldly
aiming for a prize, and, of course, it is a woman. "I love you with my
whole heart and soul and will reveal myself to you ere longâ if you prove
worthy," she wrote, and ever since Hastings has been leading this very
much better life. The actor's admirer possesses all the charm of mys
tery. She first courted his attention by leaving for him at the box office a
magnificent water-color presentment of his prepossessing self. "From an ad
mirpr," rend the accompanying card, and Bob White, the treasurer of the
theater, who received the gift, swears that the "admirer" was young and
fair and stylish, and, naturally, a woman. Since the picture episode nu
merous other valuable gifts have found their way to the box office for the
reformed actor. Like the presents at a fashionable wedding, they are alto
gether too numerous to mention. They comprise all sorts of appro
priate and costly offerings, and of such little things as neckties,
gloves and "hankys" in quantities sufficient to 'last a twelve
month. The present^ properly classified tell the tale of the fair
one's unswerving devotion. A handsomely bound copy of Tennyson, with
all the "tender" passages marked, brought with it the message that caused
the immediate reformation. "From one who loves you with all her heart
and all her soul and will reveal herself to yoju ere longâ -if you prove
worthy," made the Tennyson volume one of untold value. After Tennyson
came Owen Meredith, with all the love passages deeply penciled, and a
card which read: "Fear not, my beloved: Continue as you are and we
shall be happy soon. I have enough for more than two."
Thus the gifts went on accumulating, each present bearing a dainty
note that revealed more and more of the fair giver. "My glass tells me I
am fair." said one perfumed message, while in another she gave her im
agination full swing and wrote; "With my mind's eye I see you, saying
your prayers each night before you retire." Yesterday's gift, however,
capped the climax and, has left Hastings In a precarious condition border
ing on a complete collapse. It is an Episcopal prayer book, bound In white
vellum, and a dainty white satin ribbon marker all embroidered in orange
blossoms and true lovers' knots, calls attention to the impressive marriage
service.
Since that eventful day when the picture of Hastings made its first ap
pearance no one has ever laid eyes upon the "beautiful unknown." Belasco
says he has seen a handsome woman, answering White's description, fre
quently pass by the theater, and other theater attaches tell the same tale;
but no one is in a position to positively state she Is Hastings' adorer.
Mark Thall, manager of the theater, adds a peculiar circumstance to the
mysterious story. It appears, so Thall states, that during the past few
weeks several people have approached him and inquired closely into the
character of the actor. One wished to know whether he drank or smoked,
another If he had any pernicious habits, and still another whether he was
married or about to be so. "I gave him a send-off that any angel would en
vy." said Tha.ll, "and managed by a neat bit of detective work to find out
that they were making these inquiries for a rich, young and lovely lady."
up at the theater there is naturally much Interest manifested in Hastings'
unknown love. The knowing ones declare it is all on account of those
presents that Thall is forced to take a benefit on the 22d. Gretchen Lyons

that her name is Pauline.

The barkentine Ruth starts the first week in next month on an excursion to the southern seas. She will
call at Kusaie, Ponape and Ruk in the Carolines and at Guam in the Ladrones. The vessel will be gone about
five months, and as she is stanch, a splendid sea boat and a fast sailer, those who go south on her should have

THE SAN FEAJS' CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1898,
PILOT McNEIL
VIOLATED THE
ROAD RULES
Says the Peters Was
Steered Wrong.
COLLISION WAS AVOIDABLE
SOME POINTED QUESTIONS BY
INSPECTORS.
Investigation Into the Peters â Czar
ina Disaster Brings Out Inter
esting Testimony â Case
Goes On To-Day.
Charles McNeil, pilot of the J. D. Pet
ers, spent a very uncomfortable three
quarters of an hour yesterday morning in
the office of the United States Local In
spectors of Steam Vessels. He was on
the stand to tell what he knew about the
collision with the Czarina, and he became
badly tangled when pressed to the wall by
the questions put by Inspectors Bolles and
Bulger. He was obliged to admit that
he had violated the pilot rules for avoid
ing collisions, and his excuse was that if
he had obeyed the rule he would have
gone ashore.
Pagp & Eells appeared as attorneys for
; the California Navigation & Improvement
i Company, owner of the J. D. Peters, and
I Andross & Frank for the John D. Spreck
els & Bros. Company, owner of the
Czarina. Hugh J. Corcoran, manager of
the improvement company, and John D.
Spreckels, for the owner of the Czarina,
were present.
Pilot McNeil testified that the Peters
left San Francisco at twelve minutes after
6 o'clock on the evening of the day of
the accident and arrived at Point Blunt
about IS minutes later. He changed his
course along shore and saw a red and a
green light ahead. He could not see the
approaching vessel and thought it was a
scow or a schooner. At that time Cap
tain Holdsworth and the wheelman were
in the pilot house with him. On Captain
Holdsworth remarking that the vessel
was either a schooner or a scow, the wit
ness passed the glasses to the wheelman.
That was before he blew the whistle. The
wheelman said that it was a steamer.
Pilot McNeil blew the whistle about two
minutes after he had handed the glasses
to the wheelman.
Pilot McNeil in answer to a question
by Captain Bolles. said the pilot rules re
quired that vessels approaching each oth
er head to head, should blow one whistle
and pass each other port and port. He
was unable to obey the rule because he
would have had to turn on an angle of
forty-five degrees If he had blown one
whistle. . . ,
"Why didn't you stop when you found
that you could not give the right signal?"
i asked Inspector Bolles.
"I blew two whistles," was th% reply.
"Couldn't you stop and blow the danger
S "I^idn't think it was necessary," was
the remarkable answer of the witness.
"The vessel had swung about twenty-five
feet, or fully three points, when she
struck the Czarina."
"You must have been heading consid
erably off your original course when you
came together," wa3 suggested by In
spector Bolles. "â 
"I was headed in shore," replied Mc-
Neil.
"If you had put your helm aport when
you saw the vessel on your starboad bow
you would have passed her without strik
ing her," said Inspector Bolles.
McNeil explained that the Czarina was
not coming in a straight line. She was
on the starboard bow, and the Peters
swung around and struck her on the port
! bow. , â, _
In answer to a query by Mr. Corcoran
the witness said that it required consider
! able time to blow the whistle of the Pet
ers. It was necessary to let go of the
i wheel with one hand and reach at arm's
! length to work the whistle. He thought
I that if he had stopped to blow four whis
tles Instead of stopping and backing the
Peters would have gone farther forward
and increased the danger.
Captain W. Seaman of the Czarina tes
tified that when he caught sight of the
red and green lights of the Pet-
I ers he blew one whistle, which was
| answered. Then he blew two whistles,
which the Peters answered with one. A
few seconds later the Peters blew two
and he replied with one. He could not
give the Peters any assistance because his
own boat was injured by the collision. As
soon as he saw the lights of the Peters
he put the helm to port. Just before the
collision he saw the green light of the
Peters on the starboard.
The afternoon session began with the
examination of Thomas Holdsworth, cap
tain of the J. D. Peters. In his testimony
he showed the positions of the two collid
ing vessels at the time they struck, and
said that if the Czarina had laid
alongside afterward the Peters could
have been held up !f lines could have
been got out. There were no passen
gers injured, but several Chinamen
were drowned. In his opinion the six
Chinamen would have saved themselves if
they had not been stupefied by opium, as
they were warned by the chief .engineer
and had ample time to escape. He did not
know whether the Czarina would have
cleared the Peters had the captain of the
former passed to starboard. It was the
custom if the tide was at ebb for a vessel
going against the tide to hug the shore of
the island and the other vessel to keep out
In the fairway.
At this point Inspector Bulger asked if
custom took predominance over the Unit
ed States law, but Holdsworth was unable
to answer the question and evaded it by
laying that the rules and regulations
were followed as much as possible. In re-
to a question by Attorney Frank,
[oldsworth conceived the right of a
steamer going up the bay against the ebb
tide to take the port side on meeting an
other vessel, although the rule is when
two vessels meet head on they shall pass
port to port. Holdsworth claimed had
they followed the rule the Peters would
have been cut in two. He further testified
that as the Czarina was sighted the Peters
blew two whistles, which were answered
by one from the Czarina after a lapse of
five or six seconds. This was repeated
and then the crash came.
Witnesses were called to substantiate the
latter statement and the first one, Vincent
Lasuvilla, testified to the same effect.
William Bulson, a passenger, and Dan
Kennedy, bow watchman of the Peters,
also gave testimony in regard 10 the
blowing of the two whistles by that vessel
and the response of one by the Czarina.
A. M. Hay, wheelman of the Peters,
thought that If either vessel had stopped
and backed and blew four whistles the
collision would not have occurred.
The investigation will be resumed this
morning in the rooms of the Inspectors of
Hulls and Boilers in the Appraisers build
ing at ? o'clock.
EMPOR-UM DOLL FETE,
Large Crowds of Children Visit It
Each Day.
The gTeat doll family is having: its day
at the Emporium. A grand fete is the oc
casion, and dolls of all descriptions, from
the little, black woolly headed baby to
the rich child's "darling," participate in
the silent proceedings. The scene of the
fete is a gorgeous one, and hundreds ol
people view it each day. The room which
has been allotted to the dolls is fitted up
as an Immense fairy grotto. To the left
are a number of booths representing
scene from "Cinderella," "The Old Wo
man Who Lived In a Shoe," "Red Riding
Hood" and "Noah's Ark." There is also
a theater in which the dolls compose the
audience and talent. In the center of the
room is a miniature village, through
which electric and steam cars rush and
where mechanical soldiers and fire de
partments guard the dolls' lives and prop
erty.
The scenes in all the booths are novel
and unique, and have been arranged with
great taste and at considerable cost.

A Fiendish Revenge.
A case of shocking cruelty to a horse
was reported to the officers of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
yesterday. James C. Christiansrn of 209
Ellis street had been working for .'Jdward
Gartland, a coal dealer of 632 Post street,
and he became angry because his employ
er refused to let him use the telephone.
In order to get revenge Christiansen went
to Gartland's stable and began to stab
one pf the horses with a pitchfork until
the blood ran in streams. The brutal act
was witnessed by a Mr. Wilkie, who says
that he will swear to a warrant for the
man's arrest.

THE TALLANTS
HAVE RETIRED
PROM BANKING
Bought Out by Crock
er-Woolworth.
A MILLION THE- FIGURE
THE NEW CONCERN TAKES ALL
CURRENT ACCOUNTS.
Successful Close of a Half Century of
Unfailing Prosperity â Cashier
McKee to Go With the
Business.
As a bulwark of San Francisco's flnan
cal fortress the Tallant Banking Company
has ceased to exist. Its extinction began
on Saturday last, when one of the big
gest banking deals in the city's history
wa3 closed, and as a result of It the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank assumed all of
the liabilities of the retiring concern and
accepted something like $1,000,000 of its
assets as a balance against the debts.
The deal is in no wise an amalgamation.
The stockholders of the j. allant concern
retain the greater portion of the bank's
property, and as soon as the many mat
ters in connection with the transfer of
current accounts to the Crocker-Wool
worth people are disposed of a dividend
will be declared and the many valuable
properties and holdings accumulated by
the Tallants during nearly fifty years of
successful business will be divided pro
rata among them.
: There is no hint given out that the
transfer to the Crocker-Woolworth people
was forced by financial reverses or in
ternal dissensions of any kind. According
to the statements of President Austin C.
Stubbs, Vice President Frederick W. Tal
lant and Cashier J. Dempster McKee, the
reason for dissolution is that in the past
few years the interests of the owners
have become so great and so widely ai
versifled and scattered that the time and
attention the business warranted could
not be given It. so it will be closed out,
that more consideration can be given by
the individual stockholders to their sepa
rate interests. l-iJ'l^C'' ,
The Tallant Banking Company, incor
porated, was the outgrowth of the nrivate
banking business organized by John D.
Tallant in 1850. It was a successful insti
tution from the beginning, and prosperity
was augmented in 1856, when John McKee
became a partner and brought with him
the business of a large clientage.
It flourished as a private banKlng insti
tution until 1891. when It incorporated
with a capital of $1,000,000. of which $500,
000 was paid up. The incorporators were
John D. Tallant. 500 shares; F. W.. Tallant.
500 shares; John Dempster McKee, son of
D. J. Tallanfs first partner, 490 shares,
and kirkham Wright.
John D. Tallant acted as president of
the new company until January of 9i.
when he was obliged to retire from act
ive business on account of an unfortu
nate mental affliction that overtook_him
while on a business trip to New York
Austin C. Tubbs took his place In the
business and the other officers were Fred
erick W. Tallant. vice president; J. Demp
ster. McKee. cashier, and Kirkham
Wright, secretary.
These' officers negotiated the deal that
was consummated in the assumption by
thf Crocker-Woolworth Bank of all of the
Tallant- Company's current accounts. _
William H. Crocker, senior partner in
the Crocker institution, was seen yester
day evening Just before he left for Bur
lingame. In reference to the deal Mr.
C^We cr fo und : the affairs of the Tallant
Bank in splendid condition and were really
surprised at the magnitude of its busi
ness. Its management, ever since its or
ganization, nearly half a century ago, has
been able and conservative, and its stand
ing has always been of the highest. This
was due to the management of Mr. Mc-
Kee, who was so long president of the
bank, and to the ability of his son. John
Dempster McKee, who, as cashier, has
been in charge of the bank for some time.
Mr. McKee now comes to the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank, where he will hold a
position of responsibilty. We were really
surprised at the magnificent condition of
the bank and its business.
"The transefer of the accounts was be
gun on Saturday and completed only yes
terday, and we are ready now to receive
the hundreds of solid business men who
have for so long carried accounts with
the old company. We find that a large
portion of the Tallant ' Company's busi
ness was among the commission men.
wholesalers and those doing business with
the shipping, and this'fact, coupled with
the profitable condition of the company's
affairs. Is a source of much gratification
to us." ___^^_______ ; f'^r^-'i
STTMMEBBERG ALLEGES FRAUD
Seeks to Prevent Payment of Bills
on Street Lighting Contracts.
"William R. Summerberg. who sets forth
that he is a taxpayer of this city and
county, has sued Auditor Broderick and
Treasurer Reis to prevent the former
from auditing and the latter from paying
certain demands, aggregating about ?00,
000, of the San Francisco Gas and Elec
tric Company, alleged to be due for street
lighting contracts. The plaintiff alleges
that the Board of Supervisors so ar
ranged the manner of advertising for bids
that there was no chance for competition.
In consequence the proposals were fraud
ulent, and he asks that the wrong be ad-
Justed.
ACTION POSTPONED.
Harbor Commissioners Will Adopt
Rules for the Free Market
The Harbor Commissioners failed to for
mally meet yesterday for the considera
tion of the rules and regulations for the
government of the free market. The hour
set for the meeting was 2:30 o'clock, but
at that time only P. J. Harney and Ru
dolph Herold Jr., wore present. Edward
F. Adams, representing the Producers'
Association, was present by invitation of
the Commissioners, and considerable time
was spent by the three gentlemen in dis
cussing the free market generally, but no
definite action was taken.
President E. L. Colnon came Into the
meeting about 4 o'clock. On his sugges
tion the matter of adopting the rules for
the market were postponed until the regu
lar meeting of the Commissioners to-day,
when the matter will be formally taken
up and acted on by, the Commissioners.
WILL FIGHT THE CONTRACT.
Sanitary Reduction Works Agaiu the
Cause of Litigation.
H. Julius Conradt filed a petition In the
Superior Court yesterday, asking: that the
Board of Supervisors be enjoined from
awarding a contract to the Sanitary Re
duction Works of San Francisco for incin
erating the garbage of the city. The
plaintiff states that the contract provides
for the payment by the city and county
of 20 cents a cubic yard for all matter
cremated, no matter whether it be gar
bage accumulated by private individuals
or in public buildings. This the plaintiff
seeks to declare illegal.
Another of the Chinese Ring.
M. A. Brown, formerly a clerk in the
law office of M. M. Foote, an attorney
largely interested In Chinese Immigrant
cases, was arrested by the United States
Marshal yesterday on a charge of aid-
Ing and abetting the illegal landing of a
Chinese passenger. Brown was released
on furnishing a bond in the sum of $500.
His case will be called after United States
District Judge de Haven shall have ren
dered an opinion in the case of Shew Hon,
a Chinaman, held for trial on a similar
charge. In both cases the Chinese immi
grants were refused a landing, and the
issue has been raised by the attorney for
Shew Hon that when there is no landing
there can be no aiding and abetting the
same.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 14.â The stock market has
recently emancipated Itself in a large degree
from the influence of Sugar, Tobacco and like
uncertain quantities, but the violent gyrations
of Sugar in to-day's market could not but have
a rather unsettling effect. Quotations were al
most lost at the sugar post at the opening, and
were recorded all the way from 125 down to 124.
Before noon the price was quoted at 119 and
again before the close it went back to 124. The
early decline was based on the fall in the loan
ing rate, which was taken to indicate the con
clusion of the squeeze against the shorts and
the subsequent recovery came with the an-
nouncement of the advance in the price of the
product by the companies alleged to be en- I
gaged in a trade war of extermination. The
enormous volume of the transactions in this I
specialty gave it necessarily some sympathetic
Influence on the ganerkl list. The opening quo- !
totlon for Atchison preferred also ran all the i
way from 41 to 42 on the simultaneous sales cf ;
8500 shares. The high price proved too much
to sustain, and It ran off in the first hour, car- '
rying the whole railroad list with it. Atchlson !
preferred more than recovered later in the day
and sold as high as 42U. The adjustment
bonds were also in heavy demand and rose at
one time 1%. But the railroad list generally i
Bhowed a tendency to drag and recent leaders
were sustained at a level above Saturday's
mark with difficulty in spite of the additional j
advantage of some very striking gains in
usually inactive stocks. Finding the difficulty !
of moving the recent leaders, speculation show- ;
ed a tendency to turn in the lower priced ]
etocks.
The grangers and the Pacifies and the iron
and steel stocks showed an Increasing heavi
ness as the day progressed and some fell below
Saturday's close, while none of them show net
gains of more than a fraction. The money
market was active and rather firmer to-day,
and some apprehension is felt of a future rise
In rates, the more so as London sold stocks in
New Yor.. freely to-day as a safeguard against
a gold movement to New York. Atchison ad
justment? continued to lead the bond market,
and there was notable activity in Wisconsin
Central firsts, which declined 1%, and in Texas
and Pacific seconds Incomes and some other i
middle grade and low grade Issues at advanc- j
Ing prices. But some of the high-grade 4 per
cent bonds which have recently been conspicu
ous for strength, including Atchison. North
era Pacific, Union Pacific, Erie, Reading and
Norfolk and Western, â were disposed to reac
tion. Total sales, $7,685,000.
United States new fours registered and" the
fives registered declined % and the fives coupon
advanced H in the bid price.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Nov. 14.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were generally good to-day, ex
cept foreigner* and mines, which were dull
in sympathy with Paris.
Americans and Grand Trunk were strong,
both closing at about the best. The specula
tive Interest In Americans undoubtedly in
creased, reports from the United States as to
favorable trade prospects being fully believed
here. There were also further buying orders
for Americana from Germany.
The monetary position of Germany still re
quires careful watching. The next fortnight
promises to be a test of the financial situa
tion In Germany as an unusually large amount
of German bonds will mature here within that
period. The failure of a small banking firm
was announced from Bremen to-day.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 14.â Opening trades In
Wheat showed an advance of about %c for
both December and May. December, which
closed Saturday at 65% c, started to-day at 66%
@66% c, while May opened at 66%@68%c. These
prices prevailed for some little time. Nearly
200,000 bushels of Wheat . was taken here for
export late Saturday, and as an additional 40,
000 bushels was reported sold early to-day for
the same purpose, the v fact that contract stocks
here were less than 700,000 bushels made local
shorts, especially In December, rather anxious,
and trading, which for some time has been ex
ceedingly dull, became very active in conse
quence. To add to the uneasiness â  there was
continued talk to the effect that December had
been considerably oversold at the seaboard,
with. rumors of a possible squeeze. Liverpool
was strong and up %@l%d, and this had some
effect on trading, but not so much as it would
had it not been that Liverpool was almost
alone in the foreign strength.
The visible increase was 2,184,000 bushels, and
this was a factor .In the reaction that â  took
rjlace after the first hour's trading. There was
a good deal of realizing on Wheat owlngto the
profits, and holders of calls sold against them.
This relieved the pressure, May easing off to
66V4c and December to the same price. The
latter month was too much in demand for any
permanent downward movement, however. Re
newed buying by anxious shorts soon started
the price toward a higher level and for a time
December sold at %@%c premium over May.
The market became very strong toward the
close. December gained %@lc and May rose

Corn was slow with a narrow range of prices
and closed with but little -change. The market
was barely steady considering the high cables,

mand.

fipurct. The market was quite dull most of
the time, though there was some influential
selling which was well taken of .' Cash demand
was good. The strength of -Wheat .was ..the
main factor.
Provisions were dull and heavy. Both cash
and speculative demands were limited, and |as

TROUBLE OVER
A PHYSICIAN'S
LIFE INSURANCE
Sequel to Dr. Slater's
Death.
CLAIM AGAINST THE ESTATE
PHILIP SIEBEN'S DEMAND FOR
$250 FROM THE WIDOW.
Sudden Discovery That the Doctor
Was in Arrears to His Lodge
When the Demand War
Rejected.
AI.AMEDA. Nov. 14.â There are several i
features in connection with the payment
of a $2000 death benefit to the widow of
the late Dr. Thomas Slater of Alameda.
by the local A. O. U. W. lodge, which the
Grand Lodge of the order has undertaken
to investigate.
Dr. Slater, who was a prominent physi
cian of Alameda, died in June last, leav
ing a benefit certificate for $2000 to his
widow. Out of this has Town a tangle
That bids fair to necessitate the services
of a judge and jury, as well as the Grand
Lodge of Workmen, to straighten out.
According to the statement of William
Rigby, attorney for Mrs. Slater, Philip
Sieben, an officer in Alameda lodge, A.
O. V. W., attempted to take advantage
of the widow's grief to collect a real or
imaginary debt of $250, alleged to be
owing him by Dr. Slater at the time
of his death, and failing in that has
sought to stop the payment of the certifi
cate, by claiming that Dr. Slater was In
arrears for dues.
From the lawyer's statement it appears
MRS. DR. THOMAS SLATER.
that Dr. Slater's monthly assessment for
May became due on the 28th of the month.
but for some reason was not paid until
the following day. The doctor was grlven
a receipt, however, signed by Oscar Mey-
Bel, and dated May 28. -which receipt is
now in the lawyer's possession.
Dr. Slater died on June 16, and the day
of his funeral, according to Mr. Rigby,
Sieben called on the widow and told her
he held the doctor's note for $250 for bor
rowed money. Sieben told Mrs. Slater
that if she wouid agree to have the
Grand Lodge make out a draft to him for
that amount he would see that she re
ceived the balance of $1750 without any
trouble. Mrs. Slater replied that if her hus
band had borrowed the money she would
certainly pay it out of the death ben
â¢^lit, and asked Sieben to produce the note
given by her husband. He promised to do
no, but kept putting it off on one pretext
and another and has failed to show It to
her or hei lawyer up to the present time.
Hieben did manage to get the woman to
acknowledge a document before a no
tary giving him the right to collect $250
of tho $2DOi) certificate in consideration of
money. The lady acknowledged the pa-
This document is also in possession of
Lawyer Rlgbv and clearly Bets forth that
Mrs. Slater herself had ' borrowed the
money. The lady acknoowledged the pa
per without reading it. as the transaction
took place in the midst of her domestic
sorrows, and she was incapable of prop
erly transacting business.
After her husband's death, Mrs. Slater
was called upon to pay his lodge assess
ments for the months of June and July,
which she did. although he died In June,
and the attorney holds the receipt signed
by-Meysel. Why she should pay dues after
her husband's death is .something Mr.
Rigby cannot understand.
Dr. Slater's death was duly reported to
the Grand Lodge, and of necessity the of
ficer* of the subordinate lodge. must have
indorsed h!m as a member in good stand
ing, for in due time two drafts were re
turned, one for $1750. payable to Mra.
Slater, and the other for |250, payable to
Sieben.
In the meantime Mrs. Slater had con
puitfd with her attorney regarding Sie
ben/s claim and he advised' her that the
certificate was taken out for her benefit
and therefore her husband's debts could
not be collected from it. Consequently, he
advised her not to accept the draft for
$1750, but to demand the full amount.
When he was shown the document Mrs.
Slater had signed at Sieben's instance, the
lawyer was more determined than ever
that she should secure the full amount
and threatened to begin legal proceedings
against Sieben unless he surrendered the
draft he held.
Then, it Is claimed, the discovery was
suddenly made that Dr. Slater had been
in arrears In his obligations to the Ala
mÂ«la lodge, and consequently the certlfi- i
CBte was void. The Grand Lodge was
notified, payment of the two drafts was.
stopped, and an investigation started
which will concluded next Saturday, <
It 1b asserted among the members of the
Alameda lodge that they knew nothing
whatever of. Dr, Slater having: been in ar
rears until after the widow refused to ai-,
i
! low Sieben the $250 claimed by him. It Is
i also stated that Sieben and Meysel are the
i ones who notified the Grand Lodge of this
delinquency on the part of Dr. Slater.
Neither Sieben nor Meysel are in town to
night, so their statement cannot be ob
tained.
AN INDUSTRIOUS BUxtQLAR.
Looted a House Four Times in Two
Days.
OAKLAND. Nov. 14.â Detectives Hodg
ktns and Shorey made another clever cap
ture to-night when they tended in jell a
sailor named Richard Meade, who had
four times robbed the handsomely
furnished residence of J. W. Swift, corner
of Thirteenth and Jackson streets. The
Swift mansion is in charge of a hired
man during the absence of the family for
the winter.
Last Friday the place was entered three
times. Seven fine rich rugs were stolen
on the first entry. On the second trip val
uable coverlets were stolen and in the
evening: a clock, hall rack, bedspreads
and heavy blankets disappeared. But
the boldest play of Meade was when, on
Saturday, he entered again and ripped
up a fine velvet carpet, which he sold to
a second-hand store on San Pablo ave
nue for $3 50.
The disappearance of the carpet was
noted by the hired man, and he was about
to report this to the police when Meade
attempted to make another entrance tms
afternoon: and was caupht by Hodgkins
and Shorey, who hud already been work
ing on the case and who had previously
located all places where Meade disposed
of his booty. Of these, one place is on
Sixth Btreet, and two on San Pablo ave
nue, all second-hand dealers.
At the City Prison Meade frankly ad
mitted his guilt and was booked for the
oharses of burglary. Meade resides in
San Francisco He held some position
on one of the transports and only about
five weeks ago appeared before Justice
n Bast Oakland with a strange
young lady and was married.
CHOKED HIS WIFE.
Quarrel Between the Eagemanns
That MJght Have Ended
OAKLAND, Nov. 14.â There was a lively
family quarrel at the home of Eduard F.
Hagemann. 616 East Twenty-second
street, this forenoon, and according: to
some accounts Mr. Hagemann. who has
been suffering from consumption the past
few years, brutally assaulted his young
wife."
It appears that a dispute arose over
some trivial affair concerning the house

K-rribWd his wife by the throat and began
choking her, because she differed with
him. It is also said that he exhibited a
knife in a threatening manner.

A TRADE OF SERVICES.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, 908 Broadway. Nov. 14.
An interesting case was partially tried before Superior Judge Ogden to
day, wherein a dentist, Dr. P. McCargar. Is plaintiff and Dr. L. R. Webster,
a practicing physician, is defendant. The suit is brought for the recovery
of $36 claimed to be due for dental services rendered, and the case was up
on a.i appeal from one of the Justice's courts. The parties are well
known In their respective professional circles, and at to-day's trial there
was a most amusing development. An agreement was produced whereby
the parties had contracted for an interchange of services to be extended
to the families of each. In other words Dr. McCargar was to attend to the
teeth of Dr. Webster and his family, while Dr. Webster was to relieve Dr.
McCargar and his family of all physical Ills and soothe all fevers.
But, unfortunate as it may seem to the party of the second part, the
party of the first part and his family have managed to remain in their noted
healthy condition, and while there were no McCargar fevers to soothe,
it appears there were plenty of Webster molars that required attention
and fillings of gold, all of which could not be bought with fevers or other,
ailments that flesh is heir to. "
The trial was not concluded to-day, but defendant asked leave to.
amend his answer. The court took the matter under advisement for one
week, during which time Dr. Webster may still be called on to soothe any
Ills of the McCargars. In the meantime Attorney Hart H. North Is taking
care of Dr. Webster's Interests, and he Insists that unless the plaintiff sees
fit to contract some kind of sickness he can get no compensation.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1898.
DR. LAW HAS
BEEN TAKEN TO
A SANITARIUM
His Case a Mystery to
Physicians.
SPEECHLESS FOR A WEEK
NO PERMANENT SUBSTITUTE
YET APPOINTED.
Action Will Not Be Taken Till the
Return of the Senior Warden
of the Church, J. o
Valentine.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 14.
Rev. Marshall Law, D.D., Is completely
broken down In health and has been
taken to a sanitarium at St. Helena. Dr.
Law's sickness is one of the most pe
culiar with which his doctors have ever
had to deal.
About two months ago Dr. Law was
suddenly seized with a fit on the steps of
his church, as he was about to attend a
meeting of the Ladles' Aid Society. He
was carried to his home and for a week
he was unable to speak a word. Nothing
but an unintelligible moan escaped his
lips, and the doctors were completely
puzzled.
The physicians finally came to the con
clusion that the rector had taken some
thing in his stomach which had resulted
in very acute dyspepsia. The symptoms
baffled' Drs. Larue and Wilcox. and after
some weeks it was recommended that he
be taken to a sanitarium, which was
done. .
Dr. Law is said to be too generous, and
his finances have frequently suffered
thereby. Not long ago a creditor Became
Importunate, and the doctor, being of a
very sensitive disposition, was consider
ably perturbed. Through a friend he ad
dressed a letter to the Ladies' Aid Society
asking that it assist him in his difficulty.
It was while the meeting at which this
letter was being discussed was in ses
sion that the rector was found on the
church steps unconscious. Since that time
Dr. Law has been totally unable to
preach, and it is said that he will require
a long rest to again fit him for pastoral
duties.
John J. Valentine is the senior warden
of the church, and he is now in the East.
A temporary substitute has been obtained
for the pulpit, but nothing definite will
be done until Mr. Valentine returns.
JUDGE ALLEN HAS
RESIGNED HIS OFFICE
A. A. MOOJAE JR. IS APPOINTED
TO THE VACANCY.
Principal Crawford Will Change
Places With the County School
Superintendent.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 14.
Police Judge Allen created some sur
prise to-day by sending his resignation
to the Board of Supervisors. The Judge
has been elected District Attorney and
will assume his new duties on January 1.
He is anxious to have a holiday and to
become acquainted with his new office,
and, therefore, resigned.
A. A. Moore Jr., who has been a deputy
in the office of District Attorney Snook,
was at once appointed Justice of the
Peace, and he will probably be appointed
to act as Police Judge by Mayor Thomas.
He will hold office only until the new
officials qualify on January 1.
County Superintendent of Schools Gar
lick will give way to Principal Crawford,
and it is stated that the vacant princi
palship will be filled by Mr. Garlick.
In an article concerning politics pub
lished in this paper an error placed Prin
cipal S. D. Waterman of Berkeley in a
wrong light. It stated that in the recent
election, at which Mr. Waterman was the
Republican nominee for County Superin
tendent of Schools, he did not carry his
own district. This is Incorrect, for Prin
cipal Waterman carried Berkeley by a
vote of nearly 4 to 1, and in Alameda
he ran 2 to 1. It wan in Oakland, where
his opponent lived, that Mr. Waterman
met his Waterloo.

brought on the ground of extreme cruelty,
was tried before Superior Judge Hall this
afternoon, and when all the testimony
was In Judge Hall stated he could hardly
see his way clear to granting the desired
decree.
"There is not very muchcorroboratlon,"
said his Honor, addressing Hugh Aldrlch,
attorney for plaintiff, "and the decree
cannot be granted. While the defendant
may be an honest, well meaning fellow,
he is certainly a kind of an erratic genius
from his actions."
At least two dozen witnesses for eithe*
side had testified, and the elite of colored
society was present, for the parties are
"high* horn" in their circles, and as a
wielder of the razor plaintiff charged de
fendant with being "highly superior."
Attorney .-Idrich asked that the case be
continued one week that he might secure
the attendance of one other important
witness and the court so ordered. Judge
Hall, however, remarked that he could
"hardly see what good It would do, since
no one had testified to being an eye-wit
ness to any of the trouble between the
parties."
Judge Ogden to-day granted a divorce
to Parepa Rose Hennessey from Michael
J. Hennessey on the ground of failure to
provide, and she was granted leave to re
sume her maiden name, Parepa Rose
Miller.

RETURN OF A~ MISSING SON.
Rudolph Willweber, Given Up for
Dead Six Years Ago, Reappears
at His Old Home.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 14.â Rudolph W. Will
weber, brother of Mrs. George Morris of
this city, made his appearance here to
day after being given up as dead by his
relatives six years ago.
On Thanksgiving day, 1892, he left his
home in a fit of anger, and did not an
prise his folks of his movements until the
war broke out. Then his sister received a
brief note from him, stating he was still
in the land of the living and had gone to
fight the Spaniards. No further word was
received from the young man until he
presented himself to-day at the home of
Mrs. Morris. He had gone to San Fran
cisco to endeavor to locate his father, but,
failing in that, had come to Alameda to
find his sister. The father happened to
come over to Visit his daughter the same
day. He did not recognize his son, and it
was necessary for Mrs. Morris to give
them a formal introduction.
Willweber had been in Texas since he
left home, and was on his way to Cali
fornia to affect a reconciliation with his
family when the war broke out. He en
listed in the Third Missouri Regiment.
His company was mustered out last Mon
day, and he took the lirst train for his
old home.
Came Home to Die.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 14.â John R. Green
nell died this morning at the home of his
stepfather. 914 Eagle avenue. He was 25
years of age and a. native of Alameda
County. Greennell disappeared about six
weeks* ago, and for about a month his
Alameda relatives were at a loss to ac
count for his absence from home. His
mother was almost distracted over the
matter. Recently word was received that
he was with an uncle at Big Trees. Then
came a letter from the young man to his
mother stating he was sick, and, feeling
that his end was near, he was coming
home to die. He returned to Alameda al
most a week ago. His condition was such
that he took to his bed at once, lie grew
rapidly worse, and for several days there
has been no hope of his recovery.

PHIL WAND WILL
REFEREE THE BOUT
TO BE IN THE RING WHEN MUL
LER AND KELLY BOX.
Western Boxing Club Will Open the
Winter Season of Pugilism To-
Night at Woodward's
The Western Boxing Club, of which
Martin Murphy and C. H. Long are man
agers, will open the winter season of the
popular indoor game to-night at Wood
ward's Pavilion. The ring within the
ropes of which the cleverest of modern
boxers have fought has been placed in
first-class condition. The seating has
been remodeled for the comfort of those
In attendance.
A meeting of representatives of the box
ers was held last night for the purpose
of selecting a referee. Both sides named
several men who would be satisfactory
to them. Among the names suggested
were Danny Needham, Billy Delaney and
Johnny Crowley. An agreement could not
be reached on any of the names submit
ted, so Martin Murphy gave Phil Wand,
the well known Olympian, as the man se
lected by the club. Mr. Wand was ac
cepted without further discussion.
There are three bouts carded as the
evening's sport. Spider Kelly will box
Fred Muller twenty rounds. Kid May
nard and Kid McFadden are billed for
twelve rounds and Jimmy Rellly and P.
McGee 10 rounds.
The betting at Harry Corbett's last
night was 10 to 9 on the main bout, Kelly
being installed favorite. McFadden was
favorite over Maynard at odds of 10 to 8.
In the Paris mutuels more tickets were
sold on Muller than on Kelly. This is
where the small bettors play their money.
They favor Muller to win In from seven
to twelve rounds.
The three braces of boxers are well
matched and should provide excellent
sport. Muller has been strongly touted
on the showing he made against Tommy
Tracey at Sacramento. It is some time
since "The Spider" has been seen in a
local ring as a principal and much cu
riosity has been expressed to see him per
form.
Popular prices will prevail as in past
tournaments managed by this club.
STANDING OF
SCHMIDT'S NEW
CORPORATION
Bids Low to Build a
Big Bridge.
SUPERVISORS INQUISITIVE.
SCHMIDT'S ATTORNEY SAYS A
RIVAL IS FAVOREE.
Engineer Campbell Gets Tangled
Somewhat in His Allotment
of the Stock of the
Company.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 14.
The Supervisors spent some hours to
day trying to ascertain the status of the
Schmidt Construction Company. "Billy"
Schmidt, who made a freak campaign for
the Assembly recently, is fne president of
the company, which has put in a bid to :
construct the new steel county draw
bridge at Webster street.
The bid of the Schmidt Construction
Company is the lowest of those offered,
but the Supervisors are not satisfied as
to the standing of the corporation.
President Schmidt, in answer to ques
tions by the District Attorney, stated that
his company was regularly organized and
had adopted by-laws. He was vested with
authority to sign bids or contracts, and
had recently built several bridges.
Attorney W. K. Davis subjected -Â«Ir.
Schmidt to a searching cross-examina
tion. Mr. Schmidt could not tell who the
stockholders were, but was not sure
whether they held one share each or more, j
The company had no regular place of
meeting for doing business, and the pres
ident did not remember the cost of some
bridges which he said he had built. His
firm had never constructed an iron or
steel bridge or adrawbridge. The witness :
stated that he knew it required a plant
costing about $10,000 to build the briage, ;
and acknowledged that at present he did
not have such a plant.
Engineer Marston Campbell was ques
tioned regarding the building of bridges
and also concerning the stock in the con
struction company. Mr. Campbell said
there were five hundred shares, but he
allotted six hundred and seventy-two to
various parties, and on cross-examination
admitted he must have made a mistake.
Mr Campbell said he had figured on
every bridge advertised for in the State
Blnce the company was organized. They
had built one bridge, he said, costing $t>oo,
and another one costing $TSOO. Attorney
Chapman, who appeared for bcnmidt,
said that It was no adverse argument
that the Construction Company had never
yet built a drawbridge.
Cotton Bros., whose bid seemed to be
more acceptable to the Supervisors had
to build their first bridge, and he did not
pee why the latter firm should have a mo
nopoly, because they had been longer in
' The Ãbrldge'U brldge' to be constructed is a mam
moth affair and will cost about $80 OyO.
The Supervisors decided to defer the
whole matter till next Monday, when
more testimony will be talcen. It is be
lieved that the board will readvertise
for bids. _
Firemen Called Out.
BERKELEY. Nov M.-Flames were
discovered about midnight last night in
the blacksmith shopat 2167 Shattuek ave
nue, belonging to D. H. Frye. The fire
utarted in the vicinfty of the forge, and
was rapidly spreading- to other parts or
the building. By good chance. Fire
Chief Kenney happened to be in the vi
clnity and turned in the alarm at once.
! The Columblas responded promptly, ex
â¢ tinjruishing the blaze without much dlffl
1 culty. The loss is over $100, which is coy-
I ered by insurance.
THE CRIPPLE WOULD
NOT BE OUSTED
GRASPING LANDLORD WHO DID
NOT GRASP.
Two Justices and Many People Get
Tangled Up in a Conflict
Over Seven Dollars.
When John Erickson entered the court
of Justice Groezinger yesterday and tried
to replevin a man's house in order to sat
isfy a debt of $7 he simply smashed the
record. He did more than that. He got
himself so badly disliked by the Justice
that the latter threw him out of court.
It was a queer story. Henry Behnker, a
poor cripple, owed Erickson rent. It was
only a matter of $7, but Behnker could not
pay it. He did not have the money, and
he moved out of Erickson's house on
Sixth avenue, near I street, and sought
other quarters. The landlord did not be-
I lieve in forgiving debts of tenants. He
' went into court and secured a judgment
! for triple rent, as the law allows. Then
i he put the $21 claim down in the book of
his recollection and waited. Many
months slipped by, and the landlord's op
i portunlty came. The cripple had secured
a house. It was a small one, and stood
on ground leased for a few dollars from
' the Alaska Commercial Company out
near where Point Lobos avenue and the
sand waves mingle. It is said that the
cripple and his friends built the struc
ture, using contributed boards. When
I finished it was worth about $300, counting
the labor of dragging boards over the
sandhills as worth something.
Behnker and his wife went to house
keeping, and Landlord Erickson found it
out. Not one minute waited he, but hied
himself to the Sheriff and demanded that
the cripple's house be sold to satisfy the
' ancient debt. And it was sold. "When the
day came for the red flag to wave from
Behnker's doorstep the landlord was there
to bid. He was the only bidder, and he
bid $45 and got the property; or at least
!he thought he got it. But Behnker sued
I the Sheriff.
The landlord had to come back to the
â¢ courts once more to collect that $7, and
' Incidentally to gather in the house for in
! terest To Judge Groezinger fell the job
'< of sitting on the merits of the case. There
; wa's a long array of witnesses, both for
i the landlord and for the cripple. The bill
I was excessive for the landlord. He failed
to eet any $7 or a house, but he gathered
In a whole bunch of costs. The Judge held
that as the land was leased upon which
! the house was built, therefore the im
1 nrovements. under California law, went
with the ground; did not belong to the
cripple but to the owners of the land, the
Alaska' Commercial Company. Therefore
the complaining Mr. Ertckson had no
DroDer lien upon the house, the Sheriffs
; sale was void and Behnker and his wue
! could go back in peace and contentment
! tC> In conclusion the Judge stated that the
1 house was worth, from the testimony of
1 the witnesses, about $300, which sum was
i over and above the limitations of value
i which may be considered in a Justice's
Erickson'a $7 claim has cost him some
where in the neighborhood of $100 up to
date and the cripple is still alive and
happy- ' .

SUES FOB HER LEGACY.
Alice Edith- Waters Seeks to Recover
the Property of Her Adopted
Father.
The suit in which Alice Edith Waters
seeks to remove William G. Waters from
the position of trustee of a $5000 estate
bequeathed her by her adopted mother,
Mrs. Marantha Waters, is now on trial
in Judge Seawell's court. The plaintiff
alleges that over twenty years ago she
was adopted by Mrs. Waters, wife of the
defendant, William G. Waters. At the
time of her death Mrs. Waters bequeathed
an estate valued at $10,000 to her husband
and placed the daughter's estate In his
hands as trustee.
The plaintiff alleges that she has not
as yet received any money from the trust
estate, and she asks the court to remove
Waters as trustee and declares that
claims held against the estate by the San
Francisco Savings Union, H. C. Campbell
and T. B. Kent are subordinate to her
right to subject the assets of the estate
to the amount due her.

FILIPINO JUNTA
ISSUES AN APPEAL
Address to President
McKinley.
SCORES AMERICAN OFFICERS
OBJECTS TO THEIR TREATMENT
OF NATIVE CHIEFS.
Captors of Manila Accused of Lack
of Gratitude for the Services
Rendered by Aguinaldo's
Forces.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONGKONG, Nov. 14.â The Filipino
Junta, representatives of General Agui
naldo and the Filipino Government
here, has drawn up what it designates
"an appeal to President McKlnley and ,
the American people," but what Is in
reality rather in the nature of an ar- !â 
raignment of American actions In the ,
Philippines.
John Barrett, formerly United States j
Minister to Siam, was asked by the I
junta to present the memorial to the :
United States Government and people.
Mr. Barrett replied that while he could
have no official inliuence regarding the
Btatus of the matter he was satisfied {
that a document which represented the j
Bentiments of the Filipinos would re
ceive at the hands of Americans all the \
consideration it merited. The memo- j
rial says:
We, the Hongkonog representativese of
our countrymen, appeal to the great and
jjood judgment of President McKlnley and
tne spirit of fairness and Justness of the
American people as it is always shown in
their regard for the petitions from the i
weak ami oppressed.
While the f;ite uf the islands is still un
decided and we are doing all in our power
to prevent a conflict between the Ameri
cans ami Filipinosâ awaiting patiently the
conclusion of the Paris conferenceâ we
implore the intervention of the President, |
supported by the will of the people, to end
the slights shown our leaders, soldiers
and people by some of the .American mili
tary iiiid naval officers, although we do
not wish to wrong Admiral Dewey or
General Otis.
The memorial then avers that "false
reports are spread broadcast alleging
that the Filipinos are responsible f->r
the friction, points out that the tension
is greater every day and any moment),
a shot may be tired by an irresponsible
American or Filipino soldier, leading to
great bloodshed, and beseeches the
United States "'to help the junta to
control our own people by directing ;
American officials at Manila to temper
their actions with friendship, justice
uiid fairness." It continues:
From the commencement of the hostil
ities the Filipinos acceded to all American
ads, but after bottling up the Span
iards in Manila the Filipinos were com
pletely ignored when the Americans ad
vanced and thus deprived of the fruits of
victory. Now, after months of campaign
ing, the Filipino troops have been or-
I beyond the suburbs, where they
have no quarters and where suplpies are
difficult to obtain. All our launches have
seized because of foolish rumors that
we would attack the Americans, and
when we asked explanations we were not
even answered. The Spaniards, of late
the enemies of the Americans, have been
shown every consideration, while the Fil
ipinos, their friends and allies, are often
treated as enemies.
After asserting that Filipinos uni
formly acted upon the advice of the
Americans and were informally recog
nized by them until Manila was cap
tured, the memorial goes on to say:
We can onlj* attribute this sudden
change to orders from Washington to
American officials at Manila to avoid com
promising the American Government by a
recognition of the Filipinos or their Gov
ernment. The Americans are carrying
out these instructions literally, losing
siKht of the former friendly intercourse
and our assistance, and of the assurances
the American officials gave Agulnaldo,
which he communicated to his followers.
After emphasizing the junta's "ab
solute confidence in President McKin
ley and the people of the great repub
lic," stating that "our protests are not
prompted by animosity, but are direct
ed against conditions existing at Ma
nila and not against the American
Government and people," acknowledg
ing "our gratitude to American arms
for destroying the Spanish power in the
Philippines." and expressing a "hope
that the islands are not to be returned
to Spain," the memorial concludes
thus:
We wait the arbitrament of the Peace
Commission with even greater Interest
than the Americans, because it concerns
our land, our happiness and our freedom.
In the meantime we shall pray for peace
and a perfect understanding with the
Americans.
CABLE AND CANAL ARE
URGENT NECESSITIES
Senator Cullom of the Hawaiian Com-
mission Gives His Views
Plainly.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 14.-Senator Cul
lom, chairman of the Hawaiian commlt
tee, has arrived in Washington and will
at once begin Ac preparation of the re
port which he expects to have completed '
!n time for presentation to Congress.
"I do not believe," said the Senator,
"there will be any caviling about the Ha- '
waiian Islands, as we acquired them by
the process of annexation and not as an
incident o* war. There may be, however,
a dlfferennce of opinion with respect to
our other possessions, but these differ
ences will in time be wiped out. Our in
terests demand that a cable to Honolulu
should be built. With the Philippines in
our possession we -night to extend this
cable to Japan and from there to Manila
The treaty of peace will hardly reach the
Senate much before the expiration of the
nt Congress, but the new body will!
be guilded by the wishes of the President
and will accept the conclusions of the
treaty of P;iris.
"The march of events has pqinted out I
once more the imperative necessity for !
Closer means of transportation between
the Atlantic and Pacific. Arguments fa
voring the construction of a Nicaragua
canal are more forcible than ever before
"In my opinion, this canal ought to be
built under Government control, and I
Bee no reason why the proper kind of an
arrangement cannot be made with the
two Governments through whose terri
tory the canal will pass."
TO BE MADE EMBASSIES.
Austria's Compliment to Tnis Coun-
try Reciprocated.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.-The State
Department has received formal notifica
tion that Austria-Hungary Is about to
raise ils legation in Washington to the
rank of an embassy. This Government is
invited t') co-operate in the good \will
thus displayed by Emperor Francis Jo
peph by elevating the United States lega
tion at Vienna to a similar rank. The
State Department will immediately take
steps to comply with the courteous invi
tation of the Austrian Government.

GEN. BRECKINRIDGE TALKS
TESTIFIES BEFORE THE WAR
COMMISSION.
Attributes the Remissness of the
Quartermaster's Department
Wholly to Lack of
Experience.
Special Disi>atch to ThÂ» Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.â General
Breckinridge, Dr. Haidekoper and
Major Knox were before the War In
vestigation Commission to-day. Gen
eral Breckinridge's testimony dealt
with conditions at Camp Thomas, of
'which he was for a time in command,
and he took occasion to say that but
for the change that was made previous
to the war requiring" inspectors gen
eral in the field to report to the adju
tant general instead of the inspector
general the condition of the camps now
being developed by the commission
would have been developed three
months ago.
General said that when
he assumed charge the camp was at
the beginning of an epidemic of fever,
and that this condition gradually grew
worse. He found much that needed
remedying from a sanitary point of
view when he assumed command, but
the conditions varied in the numerous
regimental camps. He was under the
impression that all ordinary efforts had
been made by the officers in command
to instruct regimental officers Jn the
manner of sanitation and he thought
this instruction had borne fruit.
General Breckinridge said that the j
condition of all the hospitals at Camp ;
Thomas, except Sternberg, was bad. i
! They were crowded and there was a |
lack of skill on the part of the attend
ants. He thought the quartermaster's
department had been remiss in some of
its duties, but he attributed all the
trouble to want of experience. There
had been a lack of tentage at the hos
pitals and he knew of no reason why
the tents should not have been sup
plied, as he was informed that the
tents were in the quartermaster's de
pot.
Dr. Conner made an effort to get
General Breckinridge to say where the
responsibility rested for the poor con
ditions in the camp, but the latter said i
he had never attempted to locate the i
responsibility, devoting himself partic- ;
ularly to remedying the evil.
General Breckinridge had not con- i
eluded his testimony when the commis
sion adjourned for the day.
MATTHEWS SWEARS HE
SHOT TO SCARE THE BOY
Slayer of Young Hopken Takes the
Witness Stand in His Own
Defense.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 14.â John Matthews,
who while constable at Milpitas shot and
killed Henry Hopken, a 19-year-old boy,
in cold blood, told the story of his crime
|in Judge Lorigan's court to-day. The
I trial is attracting great " attention, and
"the court room was filled. During the
: election the Matthews case cut an im
portant figure. It was continued no less
than four times, in order to postpone it
â¢ until after election, at the instigation of
i influential friends of the defendant, who
I promised their support to District Attor
| ney Herrington and G. Y. Bollinger, a
gang candidate for Sheriff.
The prosecution finished their case with
â¢J. P. Thompson. He proved an immate
. rial witness, and gave testimony along
j the lines of that of last Friday.
D. C. Vestal was the first "witness for
the defense. Witness said defendant was
sober on the day of the killing. Mrs.
Alice Matthews, wife of the prisoner,
; gave similar testimony. A large number
. of witnesses testified to Matthews' good
j character.
Matthews took the stand In his own
j behalf. He testified that on June 28 last
j George Jones, proprietor of the Willow
I Fountain saloon, told him nls chicken
i house had been robbed and asked him to
I look for the thief. He was looking up the
: matter when he stopped at Pancera's sa
| loon, about four miles from this city. He j
was playing cards there when* some one
came in and reported that a tramp had
stolen a whip and coat from his < Mat
thews' i buggy. It was about dark and!
he started down the road looking- for the
' man. After going about a mile he came 'â¢
1 upon Hopken, walking along the road, i
Matthews got out and ordered Hopken to '<
stop. He asked him where, the whip and
coat was and Hopken denied taking them.
Matthews said he attempted to place his !
man under arrest, when Hopken started :
to run. Defendant then shot, as he
; thought, over Hopken's head to scare
him, but the bullet took effect in his â¢
' head.
This was the substance of his story, but
under cross-examination he became'a lit
tle rattled. He reiterated that the killing
was accidental and he shot merely to
fritrhten the fleeing boy.
The, case will be concluded to-morrow [
and go to the jury about Thursday.

BELIEVES SPAIN HAS
HOPES OF ASSISTANCE
Major General Merriam Thinks Germany May
Be Behind the Dons, With France Willing
to Help if Necessary.
MAJOR GENERAL MERRIAM has some very pertinent ideas of
his own regarding the outcome of the Peace Commission now
sitting at Paris. When he was informed that the press dis
patches reported that a crisis was at hand and that 1$ was feared
that nothing would be accomplished by the cor.-mission he said:
"It would not surprise me to see that the negotiations between the
United States and Spain had been broken off. If the work of the
commission proves fruitless it means a renewal of the war. If Spain
refuses to accede to our demands it will show that she has secured
substantial hope of assistance or European intervention. Should
Germany take a hand in this matter England will follow suit and
then I look for France to put her finger In the pie."
While General Merriam did not say so he intimated that he was
of the opinion that if any hope of assistance had been extended to
Spain it had come from Germany, with Frence conniving in the
background.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CAI/L, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1898.
NAVAL OFFICER
ENDS HIS LIFE
Fought in the Late
With Spain.
LIEUTENANT DRESSEL'S ACT
SHOOTS HIMSELF IN A HOTEL
AT BALTIMORE.
Had Been Ordered to Join the Zafiro
in the Philippines and Was to
Have Departed
Soon,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BALTIMORE. Nov. 14.â Lieutenant
Herman G. Dressel of the United States
navy committed suicide in the Car
rolton Hotel to-day by shooting himself
In the head.
Dressel, soon after reaching this city,
went to the Carrolton toilet-room and
locked the door behind him. Almost
immediately thereafter a pistol shot
alarmed the employes of the house, and
a. search showed that Dressel was dead.
In one of hi s pockets was found an
order from Secretary Long, detaching
Dressel from the Essex and ordering
him to Manila to Join the Zaflro. A tel
egram, directed to Lieutenant C. M.
Fahrs, in Washington, and signed by
Dressel, which was found on the dead
man, requested *ales to exchange or
ders with the writer, and it was evi
dently the intention of Dressel to have
sent this.
Lieutenant Dressel was well known
In the pay office and custom house here.
No one could assign any cause except
his unwillingness to go to Manila. He
is described as a pieasant, cheerful
man, with no kno vn troubles.
Dressel was about 40 years old. He
entered the navy on September 22, 1876,
at Annapolis, having been appointed
from Ohio. On May 4. 1896, he was
made a lieutenant. During the Span
ish-American war he served on board
the Puritan. Following the war he
was transferred to the Essex, and it
is said the transfer to Manila was made
on account of his value as an officer
which marked him out for continued
active duty. He had no family so far
as is known here.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 14.â Lieu
tenant Herman G. Dressel was born
and raised in Columbus, being 40 years
of age. He graduated from the Co
lumbus High School in 1874, and was
appointed to Annapolis as a cadet
from this district. He was married
to Mips Alice Jones, and had two chil
dren, a boy and a girl, now 7 and 2
years of age, respectively. His widow
at present is living in Boston with Mr,
Dressel's mother and sisters. The
Dressels were very prominent in Co
lumbus social affairs during their resi
dence here, but some years ago they
removed to Boston.
Mr. Dressel's father committed sui
cide in this city in 1881 by shooting
himself.
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Nov. 14.âLieuten
ant Dresel was well known here, hav
ing been stationed here before the war
with Spain. He was under treatment
several times for mental derangement.
He imagined that he was in a state of
physical and mental co-llapse and unfit
for further duty. Rest restored him.
Mrs. Dresel and her two children
boarded at the Maryland Hotel and left
this morning for Washington, where,
according to her statement, she was to
have met her husband.
BELEW ESTATE RAISES
A FINE LEGAL POINT
I Can a Man Acquire Property by His
Own Crime? â Attorney Rob
bins' Contention.
STISUN, Nov. 14.â When the petition for
I the final distribution of the estates of
Ix>uis and Susie Belew, deceased, came
| before Judge Buckles to-day Attorney
j Lloyd M. Robbins filed an objection on
behalf of the remaining heirs, Thomas
; and Arthur Belew. objecting to one-third
of said estnte being allowed to the estate
iof Franklin Belew, deceased, as per
terms set forth in the petition for final
I distribution.
Attorney Robbins in his objection stat
; ed that Louis and Susie Belew were mur
| dered by Franklin Belew, who pleaded
! guilty to the charge and was executed for
â  the crime in Folsom last June. Thomas
! and Arthur Belew ask that the estate of
! Franklin Belew take nothing, and that
; the whole of the estates of the murdered
] brother and sister be distributed equally
i between them.
The point of law Involved is whether
â  a man can acquire property by his own
crime. No case of this kind has ever
been tried in California, and much inter
; est will be taken in- the case, which comes
'â  before Judge Buckles next week. It is
also stated that only three cases of a,
similar nature have ever been trlea in
i the United States.

Nick Berg, Victim of Last Chispa
Tragedy, Refuses to Talk of
the Crime.
Dying Man Again Indirectly Connected
With the Brutal Murder of Captain
Brooks by a Most Remarkable
Coincidence.
Commodore Gutte's beautiful yacht, the
Chispa, a cup winner and the pride of the
Pacific Coast yachtsmen, seems destined
to have tragedies interwoven with the his
tory of her victories and the many pleas
ures enjoyed by the friends of her hos
pitable owner. Two months ago her cap

was atained with the blood of a man who
was at one time suspected of committing
the first crime aboard the yacht.
The pistol shots which rang- out Sunday
night and startled the people of 3ausa
lito seem but an echo of the first tragedy
In the Chispa's career, and before the echo
dies away it may develop that the same j
actors were connected with both crimes.
With a full knowledge that his death
Is only a few hours off, Nick Berg, who
was shot on the deck of the Chispa Sun
day night, refuses to make any state
ment regarding the tragedy of which he
Is the victim. And he steadfastly denies
having any knowledge of the murder of
Captain Brooks, who was brutally beaten
to death in the Chispa's cabin two months
ago.
Ike Elk, who fired the fatal bullet which
Is now lodged in Berg's lung, is in the
San Rafael jail awaiting the result of

"When my nephew was two weeks old he had

looked like raw beef. Sometimes blood would
come and sometimes matter. - He was awfully
bad. Why, we had never beard or read of
such a case. My sister had to tie his hands to
the hammock to keep him from scratching
bimself, he itched so. He often rubbed his
neck and face against his shoulders. The

the wounded man's injuries. Both men
have told the story of the affray Sunday
night. They agree in detail. Neither will
Btate whether there was a sinister motive
underlying the visit of one to the yacht
after the keeper had retired or the quick
ness with which the fatal shot was sent
on Its deadly errand after Berg reached
the deck of the vessel.
Two facts were discovered yesterday
which may give the authorities a new
clew on which to again attempt the solu
tion of the mystery surrounding 1 the mur
der of Captain Brooks.
Since the case was dropped Berg-, who,
it will be remembered, was 6uspected of
complicity in the first bloody crime on
the Chispa, has told several conflicting
Btories regarding his whereabouts on
that night. The alibi which he claimed
and which was accepted by the Marin of
ficials, was that he came to this city;
called on Mrs. Elk at 558 Natoma street;
then went down town and read the prize
fight bulletins, after which he went to
the Model lodging house on Mission street
and remained all night.
Since that time he has told Captain
Roberta, his employer, two contradictory
tales. First he said he was asleep on
board the yaght Azalea, which was an
chored near the Chispa when Brooks was
killed. He was not awakened by the
three pistol shots which Nelson said were
fired at him from the Chlspa's deck by
the murderers. When Captain Roberts
subsequently taxed him with telling an
untruth, he at first reiterated his original
tale and then admitted he had lied. His
second explanation to his employer was
that he. was in San Francisco when
Brooks was slain and took a room on
Market street, contradicting the story he
had told to the police.
The pistol with which Elk Bhot Berg
may possibly be the key to the Brooks
mystery. The weapon formerly belonged
to Berg, and a few days ago he gave it
to Elk. It is a six-chambered 38-caliber
revolver, badly rusted. One bullet and
two empty shells are all the cylinder
contains. Elk fired two shots at Berg.
Three shots were heard the night Captain
Brooks was murdered â perhaps they were
fired from this identical pistol.
When Elk was being brought ashore
after the shooting Sunday night, one of
the men In the boat with him examined
the pistol and, recalling this strange co
incidence, he asked Elk what had become
of the other three shells. Elk looked
startled and hesitatingly replied he dirt
not know; that Nick had given him the
pistol and he kept it hidden in his bunk
on the Chispa. After shooting Berk, Elk
went back to the cabin and secreted the
weapon in a hole Â«ear his bunk. When
the Constable came out he told where tho
gun was located.
The relations between Berg and Elk for
a year past have alternated between
friendship and bitter enmity. Berg was
known to have been warmly attached to
Mrs. Elk, and the husband would periodi
cally raise a row because his wÂ»i.e re
ceived too much attention from Berg. The
latter would get drunk and start out to
kill Elk. All this time Berg was living
with the Elks and was the principal sup
port of the family. These peculiar do
mestic conditions are believed by ac
quaintances to be the real cause of the
tragedy Sunday night.
Not long ago Berg was on a spree, and,
after driving Elk from his home, he start
ed out to find Mrs. Elk. Hearing that she
was over at Mrs. Koehler's house, on the
road to Bakers Beach, he went over there
and kicked in the door, but did not find
the object of his search. She had fled to
the hills back of the house, fearing Berg
would kill her. This he had frequently
threatened to do.
On a previous occasion the wounded
man attempted to shoot the husband, and
afterward expressed regret for his rash
ness. And at another time Elk stabbed
Berg in the back. These quarrels were
so numerous that the people of Sausalito
paid no attention to them except to re
mark that a murder would undoubtedly
be the final outcome.
The details of the shooting Sunday
night, which are gathered from Berg,
Elk and others, are: Berg left the yacht
Azalea at Tiburon, where he Is em
ployed ac watchman, about 9 o'clock and
rowed over to the Chispa at Sausalito.
Going on board the latter yacht he called
"Ike, Ike," and, receiving no answer,
started to open the hatch. As he shoved
the hatch back Elk fired two Bhots, one
i>r which penetrated Berg's breast at tbe

apex of the left lung. The wounded man
fell when the bullet struck him, but did
not lose consciousness. He regained his
feet immediately and upbraided Elk and
his wife. The shots awakened Herman
Johnson, watchman on the Ripple, who
heard Berg say:
"So you've shot me; now I suppose you
are satisfied. Oh, I wish I had a gun."
And to the woman: "Well, he shot me
and I guess you are satisfied, too."
Immediately following the reports of
the pistol, Mrs. Elk's cries for help were
heard ashore, and Constable Garrlty and
two citizens went out to the Chispa.
They brought all who were on board
ashore. While they were pulling back to
the landing, Mrs. Elk asked her husband
why he had killed Berg, and receiving no
reply, she said: . ._. ,
"If I had known you had that pistol
aboard the boat, Borne one else would
have been shot, or I would have thrown
it overboard."
When the boat reached shore Berg
walked up to Dr. Mays' office and from
there t" the Tamalpais Hotel. At first
he denied he had been shot, but at the
hotel permitted the doctor to make an
examination. The wound was of cucn a
nature tuat probing would only hasten
death, so the doctor administered mor
phine and instructed the nurses to keep
the patient absolutely quiet.
While dressing the wound Dr. Mays
asked Berg why he went to the Chispa,
and he replied that he had gone there
to call on his friends. He would say noth-
Yesterday morning Dr. Mays told Berg
that he would probably die, and if he had
any statement to make to do so before he
became too weak.
"I have no statement to make," an
swered Berg, and since that time he has
positively refused to talk about the shoot
ing or the murder of Captain Brooks.
Berg's great vitality gives him a remote
chance for recovery, but the attending
physician is not hopeful. He thinks Berg
will die within the next twenty-four hours.
Elk has repeatedly stated around Sausa
lito that he would shoot any one who at
tempted to board the Chispa at night,
and he still maintains that he did not
recognize Berg before he fired through
the hatch.
Commodore Gutte, owner of the Chispa,
says:
"It is plain this man Berg visited the
vessel for no good purpose, and Elk, as
watchman, had a perfect right to shoot
him. Had I been in his place I would
have done the same thing myself. I
visited the yacht this morning and, after
an investigation, feel perfectly satisfied
that Berg had attempted to break into
! the vessel. Klk!s story is that he was be
low and heard somebody climb aboard
j and attempt to raise the skylight. He
| drew his pistol and fired twice. My in
vestigation showed that the skylight was
! tied down with a rope, the other end of
which was tied to a hard wood bar. The
fact that this bar was broken Is the
strongest evidence in support of Elk's
story.
"I know that there was bad blood be
tween the two men on account of Berg's
infatuation for Elk's wife, but I am cer
tain that Elk did not know who the in
truder was when he fired. I do not know
what Berg's motive was in visiting the
vessel, but I think he came there to see
Elk's wife. I have known of the illicit
attachment for a long time, and was
afraid It might lead to trouble, but I do
not blame Elk in the least, as he simply
j shot down an intruder. Berg's attach
ment for Mrs. Elk is an old story and
I as far as Elk is concerned it has nothing
1 t?n do wlth T th Â£ c^ 8e - The woman deserted
Elk once, I think about three years ago
I for this same man, so I don't think she
i amounts to much. Berg was a marauder
and got his Just deserts.
"The anchorage of the Chispa at Sausa
lito seems to be hoodooed, and I am se
riously thinking of having her moved up
the river somewhere."
Mrs. Annie Elk is quite an intelligent
vvornan, of medium height, and is about
28 years of age. She has been married
eight years, and is the mother of two
boys, aged 3 and 6 years respectively In
an interview she denied ever bein* Im
properly intimate with Berg, and Itates
that his relations with her family were
only that of a friend.
In Sausalito several months ago he
lived in the same house with the Elks,
and he paid Mrs Elk to wash his clothes
and do his mending. Since that he has
contantly annoyed her with his atten
tions, professing to be profoundly In love
with her, and when under the Influence of
liquor he even threatened her life if she
sought to shun him.
Several times, according to her state
ment, he asked her to get rid of her hus
band, even to poison him, as he was no
good and unable *o support her. When
in one of his furious moods he would
flourish his revolverâ the one he after
ward gave Elk, and with which the latter
shot him, and vow that the matter would
end in a tragedy.
"Nick not only Bald he would kill me
but he said he would kill my husband
also," said Mrs. Elk. "On the 27th of last
month he flourished his revolver in mv
husband's face in the cabin of the Chispa
and the weapon was fired, *he bullet gointr
into the floor. Then he was sorry and
gave Elk the gun.
"On the night of the shooting I was
sound asleep on board the yacht. My two
children were also in the bunk. 1 was
awakened by the first shot my husband
fired, up through the skylight at Nick
Then I heard my husband shout, 'Who is
that?' several times and fire again. A
bucket was thrown violently down
through the skylight, which struck me in
the arm. Then we went on deck and found
Nick standing by the hatcn. He said, 'I
am shot, Annie.' and, looking on his
breast, I saw he was bleeding freely.
"My husband and I took him down In
the boat and pulled him ashore. He was
not angry then, but gentle and kind, as
he always was when he was sober, anil
said, 'You walk on my sore side, Annie,
because I know you will be careful and
not hurt me.'
"Oh, dear, It has all ended Just as Nick
said it would end â by a shooting, with
somebody getting hurt. They are now try
ing to connect this with the other trouble
on the Chispa, but there is no connection
between them. My husband and Bere
were both here In San Francisco the night
Captain Brooks was murdered. This Is
another matter altogether."

SENSATION IN THE BOARD
ATTEMPT TO INDUCE THE IN
VESTIGATORS TO RESIGN.
Additional Disclosures in the Matter
of the Leasing of ...inc^oln
School Property â "Uneasiness
Among the Directors.
Men have been employed by the Grand
Jury to expert the books of the Board
of Education. E. C. Kilpatrick and
John W. Atherton, who were once con
nected with the department, were the men
selected. Their first appearance in the
office of Secretary Welch of the board
yesterday caused a fluttering in the dove
cotes where so much rascality has been
charged during the past two years.
Mr. Stanton, an ex-teacher now under
indictment, has intimated a desire to re
turn here and bear witness to what he al
leges he knows of the inner workings of
the Board of Education. Altogether, as
the term of office of the Directors draws
to a close the indications are favorable
for the laying bare of their actions In
many schemes. The pressing of the suit
brought by John P. Reynolds will add its
mite to the burden of woes resting upon
the shoulders of the ring in the board.
The sensation yesterday was the ap
pearance of the Grand Jury experts in
the office of the board to go over the ac
counts.
Recently Mr. Kilpatrick has been un
employed, owing to the action . of the
School Board in persistently refusing to
recognize him as principal after the Su
perior Court had affirmed his right to the
position, of which the board had at
tempted to deprive him, and had further
more held that he was entitled to arrears
;of salary. In view of the fact that he
j had time at hi 3 disposal, Mr. Kilpatrick
; was asked by the Grand Jury to expert
| the books of the School Board, thus ob
| taining .for the jury a long wanted and
heretofore unobtainable report on the
j financial condition of the School Depart
; ment and the many suspicious bills for
supplier Which have been allowed and
paid. TbÂ» grand jurors believed that Kil
patrick was well versed in school mat
ters and would be able to detect dla
| crepancles which might easily escape the
eye of an ordinary accountant.
Principal Kiipatrick waa authorized to
choose an assistant for the work of in
vestigation and selected Mr. Atherton.
Armed with a letter of authority from
Samuel C. Irving, of the Grand Jury, Kil
patrick, with his assistant, appeared at
the office of the clerk of the Board of
Education and demanded access to the
books.
Secretary WeLch raised a vigorous ob
jection. "You're a bum :" he exclaimed,
addressing his remarks to Atherton, "and
I won t let you In behind the counter. I've
no use for you here. Before I consent
; to let my books go into youi* hands I will
protest to the presiding Judge and to the
Grand Jury. If they say you are to come
in I 11 station a clerk at your side to Bee
what you do. I won't trust you with my
i books If I can help It. As Tor Kilpatrick,
: you may come behind the counter, I sup
i pose. What do you want to do?"
"Investigate the finances of the board "
replied Kilpatrick.
After making a few preliminary in
quiries Kilpatrick and Atherton left the
! building and hunted up Mr. Irving of the
; Grand Jury. The latter gave Atherton
* credentials to Secretary Welch, stating
: that the assistant expert was employed by
the Grand Jury.
It Is known that Kilpatrick has been
: quietly at work several days In a down
town office preparing a schedule of
charges against members of the School
Board, on which he expects to gather cu
mulative evidence. That he Is on a warm
scent is shown by the fact that yesterday
afternoon there was a hurried caucus held
by three members of the School Board in
the office of tne clerk. As a result Kil
patrick received a direct intimation that
the School Board would immediately rec
ognize him as principal of the Business
Evening School and vote him his .jack
salary If he would drop the role of expert
for the Grand Jury. Kilpatrick at once
j went to a certain member of the jury and
j laid bare the proposal. "You cannot af
i ford to entertain it," said the Juryman,
j emphatically. "It Is merely an attempt
; to buy you off, and the public would so re
| card it. You must continue the work that
has been begun." Kilpatrick declared he
would proceed with the job.
The names of the Directors who made
this proposal to Kilpatrick are now in
the possession of the member of the
Grand Jury who gives out the Informa
tion, but declines at this time to name
the men. They are known, however, to be
three of the men accused by John P.
Reynolds of complicity in the $5000 job
j bery in connection with the lease of the
! school property at Fifth and Market
streets he tells of in his suit.
"We are sure of putting several of
those School Board men In San Quentin, '
was a significant remark of the juryman.
"We are accumulating evidence of the
most convincing character. In addition
to the jobs put through In connection with !
the leasing of property and the purchase
of supplies, we have found that school
teachers' positions were offered for sale
by certain members of the board. Stan
ton, who was indicted at the instance of
Dr. Ragan. as the result of a story which
Stanton told that school teachers' posi
tions were sold, is a fugitive. Word has
been received from him that he Is willing
to return and make a sweeping exposure
of the rascality of the School Board,
provided he is assured that the indict
ment secured by Dr. Ragan will be
quashed.
"The latest thing that has come to my
attention as a member of the Grand Jury
Is a Job In connection with the purchase
of the site for the Noe Valley school.
Quite recently the Board of Education,
knowing that It was already In debt more
than enough to cover Its entire approprl
! atlon. deliberately proceeded to purchase
the vacant property at Twenty-tnlrd and
Douglass* streets. 165x134 feet, for the ex
cessive sum of $12,600, which was subse
quently scaled down, for some unknown
reason, to $11,920. Right near there on
Hoffman avenue was another lot, In
every way more desirable, 250x133 feet,
which Ed Marks, the owner, offered to
the School Board for $14,000. This lot had
a large building upon It which could
easily have been used for school pur
poses until the board was able to erect a
new building. But the board would not
take it. Now, Marks comes to me and
states that he received notice on the quiet
that his lot would be "selected by the
Board of Education, provided that there
was a $5000 rake-off for certain directors.
Marks would not consider the proposal,
and so the lot at Twenty-third and Doug
lass was selected. Marks Is feeling sore
and Is ready to tell all that transpired.
There will be some sensational develop
ments In this business."
From the following story regarding the
Lincoln School property lease, It will be
seen that the present manipulators have
had their scheme In preparation for sev
eral years. Edward McGrath was one of
the original lessees of a portion of the
property and traces the history of the
lots during the past twenty-three years.
"The story of the Lincoln School prop
erty commenced some twenty-three years
ago, ' said Mr. McGrath yesterday. "At
that time the property was vacant and
unproductive. The Board of Education
could not lease It without legislative ac
tion, so the matter was taken to the State
Legislature. A bill was prepared in wilfch
was incorporated the amount of rent per
lot. This was fixed at $100 a month for
the first five years; $150 for the second
period; $200 for the next, and $260 for the
last period of time for which the lease
was to run. The bill was passed and bids
were" advertised for.
"I secured the lot on which Marston's
restaurant stands. W. H. McCormlck
took another, while John Grant secured
the corner lot, Fifth and Market streets,
./where Phil Crizamina 1 saloon is located.
"Under the measure passed at that time
the matter of taxes was not specified, as
It was school property, which is nontax
able, we went on for two years without
paying any taxes. About that time J. p-
Prior organized the 'Taxpayers' Associa
tion,' the object of which was the un
earthing of property the owners of which
were not contributing to the revenues of
the city. Among others they found our
lots and a suit was filed to compel us to
pay. The court decided the improvements
were owned by the lessees of the lots and
were in consequence taxable. "We have
paid taxes upon the buildings ever since
and In view of the decision of the court
presumed we owned them at the expira
tion of our lease on the property. To
strengthen our position in the matter the
advertisement which called for the origi
nal bids said the buildings would revert
to their owners. This clause did not ap
pear in the lease, but we thought it being
in the advertisement made It legal and
binding. ,
"At the expiration of our twenty years
! lease we notified the School Department
| that we would remove our buildings. The
board commenced suit and Judge Seawell
decided the buildings belonged to us. An
appeal was taken to the Supreme Court.
The case was advanced on the calendar
and came to trial a year before cases that
had been set before it. The court re
versed Judge Seawell's decision and thus
took from us our property.
"The School Board then assumed owner
ship and notified us that our possession
ceased. They seemed exceedingly anxious
to get us out. Mr. Grant, Mr. McCormick
and myself called on Director T. F. Burns
regarding the matter. He greeted us
suavely and cordially and said there was
no desire to disturb us; we could continue
on in possession from month to month
without the lease.
"He seemed so plausible that we be
lieved all he told us. Before we left him
he induced us to send a communication
to the board, to the effect that we would
resign all claims on the buildings if we
were permitted to remain as lessees. He
said this simple communication would
please the board and make easy our own
way. He assured us there was no prps
pect of bids for a new lease being called
for for Some time and that we could con
tinue In possession undisturbed.
"We sent this communication, not
thinking of the trap into which we vtere
being led. Immediately upon receipt of
our letter, in which we had unconsciously
signed away all our rights In the prem
ises, the board assumed an aggressive at
titude. Notice was served on all tenants,
paying the board had assumed ownership
of the buildings and all rents would be
collected by them. We had been bunkoed
out of our property and had no recourse
in law. We threw away our rights by
trusting in the integrity of that plausible
fellow Burns. We thought his word was
good.
"As soon as we were deposed A. J. Rich
of the present Grand Jury was placed in
control of the property. Through some
unseen force the property seems to at
tract grand jurors.
"Director Waller in his first statement
to The Call dwelt on the saving to the
city when the Real Estate Investment
Company assumed the expenses of insur
ance and repairs formerly paid by the
city. These expenses were always paid
by the lessees and never by the Board of
Education, so there was no such saving to
the city as he claims. Just before the
lease was granted to the syndicate the
board ordered all repairs required on the
buildingÃ made at once. From my knowl
edge Mr. Snook and his friends were plan
ning for several years to secure the prop
erty. This too, while Mr. Snook was
secretary of the Grand Jury.
"I was told before the last Grand Jury
was drawn that my name was on the list,
but that I would never be drawn to serve.
I knew too much for some people."
PREPARATIONS TO
LAUNCH A WARSHIP
MONSTER WISCONSIN BEADY
FOB HEB BAPTISM.
A Great Crowd Will Attendâ to
" Keep the Union Iron Works
Busy Two Years.
/
Irving M. Scott, the man who built the
Oregon and the other great American sea
fighters, spent the greater portion of yes
terday at the Union Iron Works in the
Jotrero making the final arrangements
for the launching of the monster battle
ship Wisconsin. Saturday morning, No
vember 26, at 9:30 o'clock the big fighter
will be slid off the ways into the muddy
waters of the bay.
In order that her Majesty Miss Wiscon
sin shall not dip into the slimy mud of the
Potrero making the final arrangements
dredged in front of the ways to a depth
of twenty-five feet. This precaution was
not absolutely necessary, as there is a
sufficient depth of water In front of the
yards to float this, the largest vessel ever
built on the Pacific Coast, but to guard
against any possible mishap to the ves
sel Mr. Scott preferred to go to the ad
ditional expense of making plenty of room
for the big ship to swing around after her
hull kisses the waters of the bay.
The honor of christening the ship has
been conferred upon Miss Lucy Gage, the
daughter of Henry T. Gage, Governor
elect of the State of California. The hour
of 9:30 a. m. has been fixed because of the
high tide at that time. Several hundred
invitations will be sent to prominent citi
zens, to all of the Federal. State and mu
nicipal officials, not forgetting those new
ly elected. So far as the Invitations are
concerned, if one-half of all that have
been asked for were Issued the yards
would not hold half the spectators. Con
sequently several thousands have been re
fused. Yet, from the position of the slip
and the wide open space fronting the bay
where the Wisconsin will glide into the
water a splendid view can be had from
along the line of Kentucky street, where
no tickets are necessary.
For the accommodation of the invited
guests Mr. Scott will have one of the bay
steamers In readiness with which the fa
vored ones will be taken from one of the
water front wharves direct to the Union
Iron Works.
As soon as the Wisconsin is out of the
way work will be commenced on the ves
sels for the building of which the Scotts
recently secured the contracts. On these
contracts the mechanics and laborers em
ployed at the Union Iron Works will be
kept constantly at work for the next two
years at least.
