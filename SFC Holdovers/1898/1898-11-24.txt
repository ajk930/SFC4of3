ENCLOSED within the crumbliner
skeleton of the Baldwin Hotel is
a heap of debris, underneath
which there may be buried the
charred remains of five to ten
unfortunates.
The swaying, spire-like chimneyÃ sur
mounting the walls, and the smoke
blackened buildings on Market. Powell
and Ellis streets mutely tell the story of
the hardest fought battle in which San
Francisco's fire department has ever
been c imaged.
The , are, which originated in the
hotel (kitchen shortly after 3 o'clock
yesterday morning, quickly shot up the
air Bhfeft in the center of the building
and inra few seconds the huge building
was a -feeethlngr, roaring, blast furnace.
Tales -f the affrighted guests who ran
for th*ir lives and the horrifying de
tails o'' scenes in and about the burning
hostelify were told in full in yesterday
i.g"s Call, and to-day the addi
l! incidents are given.
Next to the number of lives lost in
teresi renters in the origin of the fire.
Its prbgress and the twelve-hour
Ftrugul' cif brave fire laddies to subdue
the d< stroyer before more lives were
sacrificed and a greater property loss
re? ilted.
Captains Comstock and Gillespie
stated yesterday that they had definite
ly learned that the blaze started In
the kitchen on th,e second floor, but
they cannot establish the cause. For
fifteen minutes before an alarm was
turned in the kitchen employes foueht
the flame.*, but were unable to sul>due
them. When they realized the futilftv
of tbelr efforts a. warning: cry was given
and quickly carried down stairs and to
the Streets. The first comers, who ran
tÂ«. assist '.lie hotel employts in rousing
the Bleeping guests, saw the fire shoot
ing, unobstructed, up the well inane
ly in the rear of the stairway and
south of the kitchen. In less than five
minutes the four walls of the well were
burned through, and the fire ran like a
race horse through the corridors in
every direction. By the time the fire
department arrived the whole interior
of the hotel was ablaze.
But a moment elapsed after the first
alarm was sent in when a second and
a general were rung. Two fires, one
on North Beach and a larger one at
Fourth and Folsom, were in progress,
and several engines, a water tower and
a battery, which should have responded
to the second call, were delayed in go
ing to the Baldwin.
In the -neantime the fire had been
gaining rapidly, and the engineers
knew no human power could save the
Baldwin Hotel. Every effort was im
mediately concentrated on saving the
adjoining buildings from destruction.
In a few moments all the available fire
apparatus of the Fire Department was
in use, and by 4 o'clock twenty-four
engines were sending tons of water
each minute into the doomed structure.
A lack of hydrants hampered the work
of the Fire Department. There is not
a hydrant on the south curb of Market
street from Fourth to Fifth, and sev
eral engines were stationed directly be
neath the bulging walls of the Baldwin.
Many engines were too for from the fire
to do effective -work. Forcing the water
through 200 to 300 yards of hose taxed
the utmost capacity of the pumps, and
some of the streams only reached the
first and second stories.
When the battery arrived from the
Folsom-street fire the first effective
work on the Market-street side was
done. Six streams from the nearest en
gines were combined into one and s^nt
high over the side walls into the center
of the roofless furnace. â¢
When the walls became weak and
â¢were apparently about to fall Chief En
gineer Sullivan ordered the nozzle men
to "keep it black in the vicinity where
engines were located." This order was
obeyed, leaving the fire full sway in the
crater of the volcano. Two hours of
unremitting work on the part of the
firemen brought its own reward. The
fire was under control. All that re
mained was to keen the flames from
again increasing. There was no ces
sation of water throwing until 9 a. m.
yesterday, when the battle was over
and some of the exhausted firemen
were sent home. Several engines con
tinued to pour water into the ruins all
day.
Long before daylight the big crowd
of fascinated spectators who watched
the fiery panorama from the first was
increased by thousands of men, women
and children, who came from all sec
tions of the city. The rumble of the !
fire wagons, the rataplan of horses' j
hoofs on the pavements, awakened the ;
people from South San Francisco to j
North Beach. The illumined heavens ,
told thorn a great conflagration was on
in the center of town. Telephones were
F<>ught, and the hello girls, before a
question could be asked, informed the
eager citizen that the "Baldwin Hotel
was all afire." Then came the rattle
and noise of hundreds of coupes and
carriages, drivers of milk wagons urged
their swift horses to greater speed, and j
before long the entire population seem
ed to be awake and on the way to the j
flre. Vaqueros at Butchertown by thej
The San Francisco Call
score came galloping to the scene on
their tireless mustangs. A few stopped
to saddle, but the majority of them
came bareback, and many came with
out saddle or bridle.
Cordons of police were stationed at
all corners a block away from the flre,
ropes were stretched and the surging
mob prevented from running en masse
into the Jaws of death under the falling
cornices.
During the forenoon, after the
I sounder sleepers had seen the morning
[ papers, the crowd grew still greater,
i All day long thousands stood upon the
j cold, hard pavements gazing at the
ruin. With repressed anxiety and ex
pectant horror each one asked the
nearest person how many lives were
] lost and all are now waiting with sup
pressed feelings for the story which is
sure to come from beneath the debris.
Dangling from a window ki the prin
j cipal cupola was a small piece of rope.
This was the attraction for all eyes.
When the story of the little string was
passed from lip to lip tears moistened
thousands of eyelashes and words of
sympathy and praise were spoken for
heroic J. L. White. With that rope he
saved the lives of three terrified ser
vant girls and then, when his brave
deed was done, it broke under his
weight and he fell to death.
Yesterday afternoon when the heat
had sufficiently subsided, many guests
who thought a portion of their prop- j
erty might still be recovered employed
firemen and bystanders to search their
rooms. A few got some of their be
longings, but the property recovered
was badly damaged.
Curious individuals and newly-clad
guests of the hotel harassed the police
almost beyond endurance. All sorts of
excuses were given when a demand to
get through the lines was peremptorily
refused. Pickpockets infested the
crowd plying their vocation, messenger
boys sought persons to whom messages
were addressed, and the day was not
one of unalloyed content for the police
men.
Drs. Morrison and Fitzgibbon of the
Central and Harbor Receiving hospitals
were on the scene all the morning.
Ambulances were held in readiness to
carry woundeci persons to the hospitals,
and the surgeons were well equipped
with emergency supplies for instant \
use.
About 4 p. m. yesterday a large piece j
of cornice, which had been dangling
over the heads of firemen all day, fell
with a crash, striking Assistant Fore
man Madison of engine 4; Ike Shan
naughsy of the same company- and
Tom Titus, a water tower man. All
three started to run when the warning
cry was given, but they did not get out
of the way. They were knocked fiat
and the spectators thought they were
killed or badly injured. Fortunately
they escaped even slight injury.
The total loss by all parties is esti
mated at $2,000,000 to $2,500,00t); only
partially insured.
Mr. Baldwin has as yet no plans for
rebuilding the hotel. Gottlob & Marx,
lepsees of the Baldwin Theater, are al
ready at work seeking to have a mag
nificent opera house constructed on the
site of the burned hostelry. They have
received such encouragement that they
are hopeful the scheme will be carried
to a successful termination.
THE HARVEST OF THE FIRE FIEND.
ALL THAT IS LEFT TO THE PRIDE OF LUG^Y BALDWIN.
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1898.
IT WAS A FEARFUL CONFLAGRATION.
The number of lives lost in the Baldwin Hotel fire will not be definitely known until
the debris has been cleared away. So far the death list contains only two names, but at least
six people who were known to have been asleep when the fire broke out are missing. Anxi
ous friends and relatives have searched unceasingly since yesterday morning, but no traces of
the missing ones have been found. It seems almost certain that they perished. Every effort
within human power was made to awaken all the 600 people who slept over the awful cre
matory, and every one hoped no further fatalities would be reported. To-day or to-morrow
a search of the debris will begin. Until this work is completed the families and friends of the
missing must suffer the untold agony of doubt. All those seen in the corridors and windows
of the burning hostelry escaped a terrible death, either by the fire escapes or down the blazing
stairway.
The lack of adequate fire escapes, ropes and ladders has brought severe criticism upon
the hotel management and the fire wardens. Had the iron ladder on Market street ex
tended to the top of the building the sad death of J. L. White would not have occurred, and
a shuddering crowd would not have stood for half an hour with the frantic cries of three im
periled women filling their hearts with horror.
While the panic-stricken, partially clad inmates of the hotel were running for their
lives thieves entered the hastily vacated rooms and carried off jewels and other property.
Trunks which were left intact by the fleeing guests, and which were not destroyed in the
flames, were broken open and rifled, it is charged, after the fire had been extinguished. This
is being investigated by- the police.
The heroic work of civilians, policemen and fire laddies in saving fear-crazed men and
women from incineration is praised by the rescued ones. Nerve-racking experiences and mi
raculous escapes are told by those who passed through the terrible ordeal.
Estimates place the aggregate loss by the fire at $2,000,000 to $2,500,000, with light in-
surance.
E. J. Baldwin is the heaviest loser, and the severity of the blow may be greater than
he can bear. It is believed that his old-time friends, men whom he assisted in the trying
days of the California Bank crisis, will come to his assistance. One of the probabilities men
tioned is that a company will be organized to rebuild on the Baldwin site.
Fire marshals have learned that the flames originated in the kitchen and were discov
ered fifteen minutes before an alarm was sent in. Employes attempted to extinguish the fire
before the guests were warned of danger.
Several minor casualties occurred among the brave firemen who fought valiantly for
twelve hours to prevent further destruction of property.
REGISTERED AMONG
THE MISSING ONES
Absent Persons Who Are
Being Eagerly Searched
For.
Relatives and friends .of persons sup
posed to be among the missing made
strenuouÃ efforts yesterday to locate them
in the flesh or to trace them to the fiery
tomb within the charred walls of the
Baldwin Hotel.
Persons who made their escape from the
burning building affirm that many guests
must have lost their lives in the dark
ened corridors while trying to make
their escape. At the moment when they
were most needed the electric lights went
out, leaving firemen and others to grope
about in the awful smoke-laden corridors,
lightened occasionally by the glare from
the seething caldron of flre in the cen-
I ter of the hotel's ruins. Many men and
! women are supposed to have lost their
i way and In a delirium of fear overlooked
'â  the avenues of escape and thus met
| death.

, made until the wooden walls on Market,
I Powell and Ellis streets have been raxed.
! It would be hazardous to send men into
j the ruins in their present condition. If
j bodes are thought to be in any particular
place an attempt will be made, however,
i to bring them out.
John J. Carter, associate judge at Oak
land race track, is among the missing,
i With George Carroll he occunied room
' 454 on the fifth or top floor. Mr. Carroll
made his way down the fire escape on the
; Market, street side. The last he saw of
; his companion the latter had thrown a
| sheet over his head and had made a dash
j for the stairway. Harry Frolich, a book-
I maker, saw him on the third floor, which
was the last trace of him discovered. He
was a Tennesseean by birth, about 50
years of age, and was well known
throughout the country.
The Pacific Mail suamship people have
practically given up their search for
Janus M. Leithead. purser Oi. the steamer
City of Sydney, who occupied room 406 on
the fourth floor of the Baldwin. General
Manager Alexander Center said last even
ing that no doubt remained in his mind
that somewhere among- the smoking ruin.s
Leithead's body would eventually be
found.
First Officer J. TV. O'Connor of the same
boat and a chum of Leithead is convinced
that it was the dead body of his friend
that shortly after the fire began he car
ried from his room through the fire and
smoke to the hallway, where he was
obliged to abandon it to save himself.
Leithead's movements have been traced
from the time he left his boat at 3 o'clock
Tuesday afternoon to half-past 2 yester
day morning, w .en he dismissed his hack
at the door of the Baldwin and went up to
his room on the fourth floor, not quite an
hour before the first alarm of fire was
turned in.
At 3 o'clock Tuesday afternoon Leit
head left the Sydney and with O'Connor
went up to his rooms* at the hotel. Tne
men remained tog-ether until after dinner,
when O'Connor went to the Orpheum
and Leithead dressed for a dinner party
to which he had been invited by friends
in the Western Addition.
He left the home of his friends shortly
after 2 o'clock, remarking that he was
tired and was going directly to the hotel
and to bed. That he carried out his in
tention is verified by his haekman, who
left him at the hotel door at halfpast 2 or
a little before. Since then no word or
trace of him has been had, though it was
his duty to report at the boat yesterday
morning, and, according to Mr. Center,
dereliction to duty was a failing unknown
to the missing purser.
His companion. First Officer O'Connor,
is convinced that his friend is lost. It was
a frightful story of the fire that he had to
relate yesterday, and he had an experi
ence and an escape that would have
silvered the hair of a man of ordinary
courage.
"Something or other awoke me,' said J
O'Connor, "and I rang the bell for a bell- i
boy. I got no answer and rang again,
with the same result, and I opened the
door to look down the hall, but was nearly
blinded by a cloud of smoke. I made my
way to the bathroom of my suite and
looked up through the glass light shaft
just in time to see blinding flames shoot
through it. There was a crash of glass,
and almost at my feet fell the body of a
man, and I am certain that it was that
of Leithead.
"With the assistance of a man who had
come into my room to wake me I car
ried the body into the hall, hut it was
so dark we could not make out his fea
tures, but I felt of his face and tried to
identify him- in other ways and am sat's
fied that the body was Jim's. The smoVo
came down on us then and we had K^
leave the dead and take care of the living
women who were rushing frantically up
and down the hall, shrieking, praying and
utterly panic-stricken.
"We rounded up a lot of them and led
them down stairs. We then went back to
get the others, but were shut off from
them by the smoke and flames and so we
went to work on the lower floors."
There is general sorrow^at the Pacific
Mail office. Leithead had neen in the em
ploy of the company for nearly five years,
and was immensely popular with the offi
cials as well as the employes. He w?s
about thirty years of age and. If deau

A MARTYR TO HIS
SELF-SACRIFICE
J. L. White Met His Death in
a Noble Endeavor to
Save Lives*
J. L. White, who was killed in the ter
rible calamity, died tne de.^th of a hero.
He was a man of noble character and bril
liant qualities of mind. He had everything
to live for, but he did not hesitate to do
all in his power to save three women at
**he imminent danger of his own life, and
in the carrying out of his heroic Impulse
an unfortunate accident pu< an end to a
happy career. Monuments are erected for
less brave deeds than his, i-ut the mem
ory of his generous action will live long
in the memory of San Franciscans.
Miss Kate Richardson, Â«vho with her
friend had lowered themselves by a rope
which they had attached T â  a bedpost in
their room on the top floo 1 , had reached
the fifth story while the cupola was burn
ing fiercely. They were oil the ledge of
the window facing the apartment of J. L.
White. Miss Richardson ad displayed
remarkable courage in the â â â¢irrible ordeal,
and it was she who conceived the plan to
lower herself and Miss Joh'.son by means
of the rope. There were Several gentle-
men and a lady with Mr. "White in the
room, and the lady, whose name could not
be ascertained, made pitiful entreaties to
be saved. It was then that White's hero
ism was evinced. With no thought of
himself he helped the ladies to slide down
the rope one by one to the ladder below,
the strange lady being the first one to so
down. Then Miss Johnson was lowered,
and the last was Miss Richardaon. The
window ledge was very hot by that time
and every minute the danger increased.
Finally, when White saw that the ladies
had been landed safely, he started to go
down the rope, but it burned through
when he reached the third story, and
when he was picked up he was dead, a
martyr to his self-sacrifice. â¢
Due credit must also be given to Miss
Kate Richardson. She lowered three la
dies who came to her room in the top
floor while she was arranging the rope.
With a heroism eriual to that of White
she helped them to reach the first ledge
on the side of the house where the fire
men rescued them. Miss Richardson, in
speaking of the affair, said : "Too much
praise cannot be given to Mr. White, who
met such an awful death. When I reached
his room I said to him: 'You had better
go down.' The smoke by that time had
become more intolerable than it was in
my room when I left it.
" 'No,' he said 'you go down first, and
then he assisted us three ladies to make
the perilous attempt which resulted so
disastrously to him. Poor fellow, had he
waited a moment he would have beea
saved with the other gentlemen who were
with him, as I am told they were brought
safely down. I cannot express my feel
ings when I realized our peril. Above us,
on the top floor, was the burning cupola,
and below an appalling death. Neverthe
less I felt that coolness would alone save
me. The crowd on the ground was more
excited than I was, as they kept crying
out frantically, 'Don't jump. You're all
right where you are. There's no dan
ger.' I had no intention of jumping. My
sole desire was to reach the ground in
safety and I bethought myself of the rope
which I have had in my room some years
for just such an emergency. It saved
several lives and I regret that it failed in
the case of poor Mr. White."
GOT SAFELY OUT
AND THEN EXPIRED
Suspicion That the Body of
Lewis Mayer Was Robbed
of Jewelry.
Lewis Mayer, a member of the firm of
Bernard Stahl & Co., cigar manufacturers.
New York, had rooms on the fourth floor,
and was among the first to get out. He
was partially dressed, but brought his
overcoats and satchels with him. He got
to the corner of Eddy and Powell streets
and sat down on a box. Some bystanders
saw him sway and fall. The patrol wagon
was summoned and he was hurried to the
Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Tormoy
discovered that he was dead. It is sup
posed he was suffering- from heart disease
and the fright killed him. The body was
removed to the Morgue. He was about 60
years of age and a widower. Hla daugh
ter is a student at Vassar and she was
to meet him in a day or two at Seattle
to spend her Christmas holidays with him.
He was president of the Latuya Bay Gold
Placer Mining Company of Alaska, and
was going there with his daughter.
Mayer's friends claim that the body was
robbed of over $4000 worth of diamonds
and considerable money. Last night O,2
H. Savajre, vice president of the eom
pai y, visited the Receiving Hospital and
endeavored to ascertain what had become
of his jewelry and money.

The income <>f the Baldwin Hotel
property, including stores, basement,
theater, cafe, and everything else rent
able about the establishment, was fig
ured at $112,000 per annum. The rev
was considerably increased by the
â¢ repairs and remodeling of the
Btructure.
The fire is a serious loss to Mr. Bald
win as it deprives him of the revenue
upon which he relied to pay interest
on the great sum of $1.688,(foO. There is
a good deal of conjecture concerning
his ability to rally again and begin
anew the struggle. It is very well
known - that he has been badsrered.

years, yet those familiar -with his af

regain -what he had lost, and re-estab

The disastrous fire came just at the
time when he was beginning to realize
something from recent heavy outlays
in improvements. The insurance
which he receives cuts a small figure
in the matter, as it amounts to only
$50,000 on buildings assessed for $327,000.

When the Bank of California went
down in a terrible crash twenty-three
years ago Lucky Baldwin was a multi
millionaire. He was one of the rich
men of California who stood in with
Sharon, Reese and others to regenerate
the bank and place it on a more endur
ing basis than ever. Millionaires may
now come to his rescue and enable
him to erect on the ground now occu
pied by the ruins of the hotel a modern
buildbjg. from which an income may
be derived vastly greater than that
which the old building under the most
favorable auspices could earn.
The real estate is ample to secure the
Hibernia Bank's loan. The great value
of the ground offers to Baldwin his one
bright chance of getting on again in
tht world. He was lucky in getting the
land for $700,000. He was lucky in
court in establishing the fact that
Hewston had agreed to take $700,000.
An incident in the trial of the case is
recalled now as interesting. Hewston,
who made money in Sacramento selling
clothes, came to San Francisco
and made more money. He made BO
much that he could easily afford to
spend some in fine living abroad. While
in Europe he was advised to come home
and ratify an agreement of his agent
to sell to Baldwin the property on Mar
ket, Powell and Ellis streets for $700,
000. He came back at once, and among
the first "forty-niners" that he met was
D. J. Staples. They talked of old times
and incidentally the proposed sale of
the land for $700,000 was mentioned.
Speaking of his future movements
Hewston referred to a chateau in Eu
rope and his purpose to spend some
money to embellish it.
At this suggestion Staples fired up
and read a lesson to his old friend. The
lesson was that money earned in Bell-
Ing clothing to Californians should be
invested in California and not squan
dered in Europe. A few days after this
conversation took place Hewston as
certained that the land which his agent
had agreed to sell to Baldwin for $700,
000 was for a fact worth a million in the
market, hence he declined to sell at the
r figure. A lawsuit followed, and
Staples being called as a witness had to
relate under oath all the talk with
Hewston about the villa which was to
be embellished and adorned with some
of the $700,000. The case went against
Hewston in the lower court, and pend
ing the appeal he died. His widow
thereupon settled the case on a com
promise basis, and the villa no doubt
was embellished according to Mr. Hew
ston's design.
FELL BACK INTO
A TOMB OF FIRF.
One Woman at Least Re
ported to Have
Perished.
At least one woman is reported to have
met a frightful death in the flames.
Martin Finberg. a clerk in the grocery
department of the Emporium, was an eye
witness to the tragedy, and told his story
to a Call reporter yesterday.
"I was standing at the corner of Powell
and Eddy streets," he said, "when I saw
a woman appear at a window in the
cupola soon after Captain White had met
death. She was clad only in her night
garments, and her hair hung loose around
her shoulders. Suddenly the girl threw
up her arms in affright and fell back into
the fiery tomb. I saY her no more, and
am certain she must have perished."
INSURANCE MEN
WERE VERY SHY
Risks All Low and Much Scat
tered â A Total of
$146,000.
Insurance men were shy of Baldwin
Hotel risks. In 1X75, when the hotel
building was erected on ground leased
from Hewston, the clothing merchant,
E. J. Baldwin sought to get a low rate
of insurance. The premises were sur
veyed by D. J. Staples, Mr. Forbes and
others, who had kept a sharp eye on the
1 ulidlng U th<> construction progressed.
The underwriter! reported fixing the rate
at 5 per cent. Mr. Baldwin protested
against the rate, as he considered it ex
cessive and prohibitory. D. J. Staples,
however, refused to recede, and even
counseled the Firemen's Fund to take
no risks even at the 5 per cent figure.
The advice was followed and the Fire
men's Fund is not to-day in the list of
losers.
Lucky Baldwin determined to allow his
property to go uninsured rather that pay

$1250 and the Agricultural had $1500 also
on the hotel fittings. Fourteen paintingÃ
on the first floor of th" hotel were in

pictures. Mr. Baldwin and other con
noisseurs placed a high value on the rare
works of art which adorned the barroom
and office of the hotel. Patrons of. the
turf and summer boarders at Lake Tahoe
will regard the loss of these paintings as
a lamentable event, and, next to the loss
of human life, the most serious result or
the fire. â ,
J. J. Groom's stock of hats was entirely
destroyed. Among his insurance policies
was one in the Royal for $3000.
The Hartford carried $1500 on the stock
in the Baldwin Pharmacy. The Baldwin
Jewelry Company was insured for $2500 in
the Hamburg-Bremen, $2500 in the Na
tional Hartford, $2500 in the Springfield
and $2500 in the Aachen and Munich.
Of the total Insurance the loss is esti
mated at $130,000.
The estimated losses were as follows:
Moses M. Gunst, cigar ' store on the
southeast corner of Powell . and Ellis
streets, about $21,000 worth of stock in
store. Until an examination of the stock
is had it would be impossible to say if
any of the goods have been saved.
A S. Levin, jeweler, 938 Market street,
between $5000 and $6000 in stock. It is
probable that nothing has escaped de
struction between fire and water. Jewelry
valued at about $6000, a considerable quan
moval during the fire.
J. J. Groom, hat store, 942 Market
street. $9000 worth of hats and material.
Nothing saved.
Mrs S. R. â  Hall, millinery store, 946
Market street. $4000 in stock; Total loss.
J. Edlin, merchant tailor, material on
hand and goods on order, $2500. All de-
The Baldwin Jewelry Company, 94S Mar
ket street, goods, about $4000. The es
timated loss in this place cannot be es
timated, as considerable of the goods may
be saved when the debris is moved.
The Edison Phonograph Company, 950
Market street, managed by Peter Baciga
lupi stock of instruments and material
valued at about $6000. a considerable quan
tity of which can be used at little ex
pense. Total loss may not exceed $4000.
Baldwin Clothing store, 924 to 930 Market
street, running through to Ellis street,
stock estimated at about $20,000. The Mar
ket street portion of the store escaped
without any damageâ not even a broken
! pane of glass. This store is under the
annex and was known in former years
as the Arcade. It was built by a man
' named Green before the Baldwin had been
i erected and as a consequence was a sep
arate building, protected by its own wa.lls
and roof, and therefore received no in
jury from either fire or water, except a
i "portion on th<. Ellis street side, but at
that i-nd of the store all the tailoring was
conducted; hence it Is considered that
the loss is merely nominal.
Grant's pharmacy, or, as it was gener
ally known as Baldwin's drug store, was
conducted by Isaac Grant; value of
j stock about $15,000. The damage will
â  probably be equal to the entire amount,
1 as the store received a severe drenching
at the hands of Chief Sullivan, who kept
a stream of water constantly directed on
} the front, in order to prevent explosions
from the chemicals.
i The Powell street front having been used
: as sitting room, billiard mom, grill and
i lunch rooms until recently, the only stores
i or places where business was conducted
i were the barber shop kept by John Brod
erick, whoso stock might be valued at
$500, and the loss probably $150. In one
| of the grill rooms recently vacated a
florist had just taken the place,
and called it the "Flower Basket." About
$160 was destroyed in this place in the
traction of the furniture.
The Baldwin Grotto, or Cafe, as it was
more recently known by, became what it
was forty years ago â a pond. The enor
mous quantity of water pumped into the
building found lodgment in the cellar, and
' sent beer barrels, whisky casks and other
1 stimulating fluids bobbing about on a
j bubbling and very much disturbed sur
| face of. dirty water; limburger cheese,
bologna sausage, boxes of sardines, ham
shanks, sauerkraut, pickles, mixed and
single, with empty and half empty beer
j bottles, glasses, boxes of cigars and case
l goods met and re-me.t in their peregrina
tion about, the enstly tiled floor that a
few brief hours previously had been trod
upon by well-shod feet. What the loss
| in this cellar may amount to cannot be
even guessed at until the water gets
pumped out. It is said that there was
about $7000 worth of stock and furniture
in the place.
On the Powell-street front, in a por
tion of thÂ«> old billiard room, M. A. Ja
cobs had but recently occupied a portion
of the store as a tailor"s establishment.
His stock, whirh was of good quality, may
be valued at $3000. It was all destroyed.
MAID MILLER HAD
A STRANGE WARNING
Why the Actress Left Her
Apartments at the
Baldwin.
Owing to an attack of nervousness,
caused by the sense of an lmDendine
something, one guest of the Baldwin
missed the terrible experience of
Wednesday morning, an escape which
possibly saved her life. She is Miss
Maud Miller, daughter of Joaauin
Miller, who is now playing ingenue
parts at Morosco's Grand Opera-house.
After the performance she went home
to her room on the fifth floor of the
hotel and soon after retired. She was
unable to get to sleep and lay awake
for some time.
"I did everything possible," said
Miss Miller, "to get into dreamland.
MISS MAUD MILLER, Daughtei
of Joaquin Miller.
but I stayed right here. I counted
sheep, said the multiplication table
and thought of all the tiresome things
I could call to mind. I even recited
my stage parts and went through auite
a long rehearsal, but for all that re
mained wide awake.
"Well, I grew more and more sleep
less and nervous and concluded to get
up. Something seemed to be in the
air and I positively got afraid to stay
there any longer. I dressed myself,
wrapped up and left the room. In the
hall I fortunately met an acquaintance
and persuaded him to escort me down
to the residence of Mrs. St. Mary, at
the corner of Sixth and Folsom streets.
There I passed the night and only
knew of the dreadful burning of the
Baldwin when I awoke this mornintr.
My room in the hotel was situated far
from the staircase and I tremble when
I think what would have been my ex
perience had I remained there. As it
Is, I have lost everything I had except
the clothing I stand in. I am not gen
erally nervous and I am not at all su
perstitious, but I shall always feel that
something strange Impelled me to leave
the Baldwin that night."
Miss Miller's story does not end with
her narrative.
Soon after the flames burst out. Hair
Wagner, knowing that she was a guest
at the hotel, hurried through the dark,
smoky corridors to her door. He
knocked and called in vain. Finally
the llames broke out near him and he
waÃ forced away. Almost suffocated
by the smoke and heat he was driven
out In the â  main corridor. It was co
dark that he could not see and it waa
with great difficulty that he found his
way down the ioug flights of stairs.
The building was apparently deserted
and he hurried into the street to at
tempt to reach Miss Miller's window by
the fire escape, when he was told by an
acquaintance that she had left the hotel
earlier jn the evening.
At 11 o'clock in the forenoon the peo
ple assembled at their regular rehearsal
at the theater and waited in suspense
for Miss Miller's appearance or definite
j news of her fate. Promptly she came
and the story of her lucky spell of ner
vousness was told.
THEATRICAL FOLKS
SUFFER HEAVY LOSS
Managers Gottlob and Marx
Have Experienced Three
[Fires in One Year.
A strange fatality seems to hover about
the theaters controlled by Messrs. Gottlob
<Sc Marx, for they have experienced three
fires within a year at their places of
amusement. In January last the Colum
bia was burned out, and. strange to say,
the same company now playing there was
the attraction at that time. Then the Cal
ifornia Theater took fire one night in
March, when Melba was filling a popular
engagement. Now comes the third visita
tion at the Baldwin Theater, an<3 yet the
two gentlemen are cheerful under their
losses, which have been very heavy. Mr.
Marx looks upon the third calamity as a
charm and hopes it will prove so.
They had lately completed over $5000
worth of improvements in the Baldwin,
and now all that has gone up in smoke.
They carried $2500 insurance on their car
pets and furniture in the burned theater,
but that will by no means cover their
loss.
William Gillette, who was playing an
engagement that promised to I"- most BUC
cessful, suffered a In** "f JSOOO worth of
scenery and costumes, and carried no in
surance. Messrs. Gottlob it Marx, with
the energy which has at all times charac
terized them, immediately began arrange
ments to transfer the attraction to the
California Theater on next Monday night
It is probable that the engagement will
be for two weeks'. In the meantime they
have put their force of men from the threa
theaters at work painting scenery, manu
facturing properties and constructing the
carpenter work neressary for the produc
tion of "Secret Service." Gillette himself
is gating bids from three firms for cos
tumes, and the production will be given
with as elaborate accessories as the old
one.
Arrangements will be concluded by the
first of the year to play the Baldwin
bookings at the Columbia and those of the
Columbia at the California. It is ex
pected that a magnificent theater will be
constructed on the site of the old theater,
and one with a view to playing extra
ordinary attractions.
Several of the performers in "Secret
j Service" lost considerable property in the
| tire. Their theater trunks, which were in
I their dressing rooms, were entirely con-
I sumed. Miss Hope Ross calculate that
she has lost $2000 in costumes and jewelry.
Stage Manager Joseph Francoeur, at 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon, placed a lad
der on the Ellis-street side of the hotel
and secured his wife's trunk and some
clothes. His own trunk fell through with
the burning floor of the closet and is
probably now in the debris. He also saved
the manuscript and plans of the play.
A. J. Spencer, who represents Jacob Litt
Jn "Mistakes "Will Happen," lost every
thing he possessed. He had $1000 in his
trunk, of which he cannot find a trace.
He was obliged to borrow an overcoat for
himself and several articles for his wife.
He, with a number of others, who were
Euesta at the hotel, took shelter at the
angharn. on Kills street. Manager Gal
lagher of that hostelry said he had loaned
out three pairs of suspenders, a half
dozen shirts, several pairs of socks and
collars innumerable to thespians who had
lost their all. Among those who took ref
uge with him were James Campbell. "Doc
Freeman" of "(Jay Coney Island" and
Mrs. Perry of the "Secret Service" Com-
Mr." Marx is inclined to think the fire
started in the kitchen of the hotel, which
is immediately behind the stage. Man
ager Alfred Bouvier, who was connected
with the theater several years ago, says
he has repeatedly cautioned the hotel
management about their ovens and con
necting pipes. Everything was all right
on the stage when the last man left alter
the performance Tuesday night, and the
watchman made his rounds at 12. 1 and 2
o'clock and did not notice anything wrong.
Mr. Marx emphatically declares that the
fire did not originate on the stage, as has
been rumored.
WHITE'S REMAINS
AT THE MORGUE
Friends Pay Tributes of
Respect to the Dead
Hero.
Scores of friends of Jonathan Lloyd
White visitgd 'the Morgue yesterday
for the purpose of viewing the remains.
More than half the number were ladies.
In the afternoon Deputy Coroner Mc-
Cormick handed over to the I'ublic Ad-
ministrator the property found on the
person of the dead man. The gold
watch showed the effects of the fearful
fall that -killed its owner. The dial
was broken and the works were
stopped by the shock. It was made in
Geneva, Switzerland, and is said to
have cost the deceased $1000. On the
case was the initial "W," composed of
thirty-five small diamonds. On the
other case was the engraving- of a
Knight Templar on horseback, sur
mounted by the legend, "In Hoc Signo
WHAT OLD DAVE
SCANNELL THOUGHT.
OLD Dave Scannell, so long chief of the Fire Department, had his
own opinion of the Baldwin Hotel as fuel for a big fire, and he
used to express it in that forcible diction so peculiar to the old fire
fighter. He said on one occasion:
"That building is a menace to Market street. If a fire ever
breaks out in it all h won't be able to stop it. While I have charge
of the department, if a fire breaks out in it I will not allow one of my men
to enter it. I will fight it from the outside; that's what I'll do. What I
want in case of a fire there is to confine the fire to that building."
Scannell had a standing rule that if an alarm should come- in from
box 47, the "Baldwin box," if .the fire was in the hotel a second alarm was
to be turned in immediately.
Vinces." There was also a $500 solitaire
diamond ring, a gold mat,ch box, bent
from the fall, and the setting of a shirt
stud, from which the diamond had been
lost, the setting having been spread by
contact with the sidewalk and having
dropped out. Judging from the size of
I the setting the stone must have been
! worth $200 at least. It is probably
| lying in the debris near the sidewalk.
The deceased has a mother in New
York, State and was one of a family of
twelve children. The inquest will be
held on Saturday morning. A Coroner's
jur"y was impaneled yesterday after
noon.
Public Administrator Freese applied
for letters of administration upon the
estate of Captain White yesterday af
ternoon. The petition states that the
estate of the deceased consists of real
and personal property of unknown
value. It is reported, however, that
the unfortunate capitalist left property
i valued at $250,000.
ELEVATOR CAME NEAR
BEING A DEATH CAGE
Electric Current Stopped as
a Load of Passengers
Reached the Ground.
Frank Hanna, his wife, Mrs. Ray
Fromberg, the milliner, and her sisters,
Mrs. Susie Lichtig and Mrs. Ettling,
occupied adjoining rooms on the fatal
fifth floor at the Baldwin. Their escape
from incineration was miraculous.
They went down in the electric elevator
and just the instant the car reached
the office floor the current ceased and
the lights went out throughout the
burning building. The passengers on
the last trip escaped being caught be
tween floors by only a fraction of a sec
ond. Mr. Hanna told of the thrilling
incident last night. He said:
"My wife and I were sound asleep in
our chamber when the fire broke out.
Mrs. Ettling, my wife's sister, rapped
violently on our door and told us the
hotel was burning. I opened the door
and saw we had no time to spare.
Seizing the baby, I jumped into the
hall, telling my wife to stick closely to
me.' Then I got all the ladies together
and we ran to the elevator. I knew it
was a dangerous proceeding to go down
FOUND DEATH IN SAFETY.

in the elevator, as it might get caught
between floors and we would all be lost.
But I decided on an impulse and told
the ladies to get into the car. A num
ber of other guests also entered and the
boy started on the downward trip.
"I shall never forget my sensations
as we were descending. I heard
women's screams from all parts of the
hotel. These cries mingled with the
hoarse shouts of the men who were as
sisting guests to escape, and the awful
roar and crackling of the flames nearly
paralyzed my power of thought. Then
the fear that the elevator would not
reach the ground floor came upon me
and I felt we were all doomed. The few
seconds required to make the descent
seemed like eternity, and I thought the
distance was thousands of miles.
"An instant before the car stopped at
the office landing eve*y light went out,
and a sudden jerk on the cable told us
the electric current had been severed.
Then I realized what a miraculous es
cape we had. I don't know whether
the other passengers went through the
same experience. I hope they did not."
WORK OF THIEVES
AND PICKPOCKETS
A Number of Arrests Were
Made by the Police
Department.
Thieves and pickpockets made the
most of the opportunities afforded them
to ply their vocations. Policeman
Harry Hook saw three men carrying
away a trunk that contained valuable
Jewelry belonging to a traveling sales
man for an Eastern firm. When ther
saw the officer following them they
dropped the trunk and ran. Hook
fired three shots after them and it is
believed one of the men was hit.
Policeman Stanton and Special Of
ficer H. Smith about 4 o'clock in the
morning saw a man carrying away a
large picture. He was overhauled and
said that "Jake," one of the bartenders
in the saloon had asked htm to foilow
two men \. "~o stole the picture and ar
rest them. He told the same story to
Judge Mogan yesterday morning and
added that the two men had just got
away when the officers arrested him.
He said his name was James B. Brown
and he was a bartender in Folev's
saloon, 19 Steuart street. The charge
against him is petty larceny and the
Judge continued the case till to-mor
row. The heavy oil painting, repre
senting a flock of sheep, is booked as
evidence against him.
Three pickpockets were captured yes
terday afternoon. William King was
working the crowd in front of the Em
porium and was arrested by Detectives
Silve- and Reynolds. When searched
at the City Prison a diamond ring:,
diamond stud and gold watch were
found in his pockets. He is detained
in "the tanks" for further investiga
tion. C. J. O'Brien also made his scene
of operations in front of the Emporium.
He extracted a purse containing: *1 40
from the pocket of a lad-- who had a
baby in her arms. She sot h"M of
him and detained him till Detectives
Reynolds, Silvey and Crockett appear
ed.* He was charged with errand lar
ceny. Thomas Norton is in "the
tanks." He had his hand in the pocket
of a lady whin caught. The police
want the lady to call at headquarters.
She was a small woman dressed la
black.
PRICELESS ART
TREASURES GOME
Mr. and Mrs. Charles L. Ack
erman Suffer an Irrepara
ble Loss.
Probably the heaviest loss suffered
by any individual guest of the Baldwin
falls upon Charles L. Ackerman, whose
priceless art collection and matchless
library were badly damaged. Mrs.
Ackerman lost all her beautiful dia
monds and other Jewelry, the value of
which exceeded $15,000. But both Mr.
and Mrs. Ackerman are thankful they
escaped a horrible death. They occu
pied a corner suite at the Market-Pow
ell-street junction. Soon after they es
caped dense volumes of smoke poured
into all the rooms on the fourth floor,
and any attempt to save Mx. Acker
man's treasures would have been futile
and resulted in loss of life.
Mr Ackerman's books alone were
valued at $10,000. For years he has
been collecting the works of all the
recognized authors, ancient and mod
ern, and the library was a source of in
finite pleasure to himself and lovers of
rare books who had the good fortune to
secure access to these vohimes. Mr.
Ackerman's rare and antique statuary
and paintings, for the size of the col
lection, were in point of artistic ex
cellence superior to anything on this
coast. Yesterday afternoon several
men were employed in recovering these
treasures from the debris. Exquisite
bits of sculptors' skill were lowered to
the ground in baskets, and even In their
cracked and smc-ke-blackened condi
tion excited the admiration of all who
secured a glimpse as they were carried
through the crowd.
Mr. Ackerman is unable to correctly
estimate his financial loss, which is
nothing compared to the destruction of

The accounts of the guests differ little

shouts and heavy blows on the doors be- I
hind which they lay sleeping; then the j
struggle, clad in nightrobes, through the |
smoke-filled and stifling corridors in a i
blind search for the stairway; flames that
burst from the roof and upper windows.
It is a remarkable fact that absolutely !
nothing was saved by the fleeing and I
terrified guests. Most of them were peo- j
pie whose apartments contained valuable
personal property, all of which is a total |
loss. Money and jewelry, as well as cost- j
ly furniture, were left in that sudden run [
for life. After the fire had been extin
guished, however, a number of rooms were j

other imperishable articles were found on

A short time after the flre broke out Captain Wittman appeared on the
scene with a squad of officers. He ordered them to keep a sharp lookout for
thieves as well as keep the immense crowd of sightseers from interfering
with the heroic efforts of the firemen.
"My idea was first to protect the gursts against being robbed and to
save as much property as possible," remarkfd ihe captain of the Central
station last night. "Immediately after I reached the scene I ordered my
men to throw out the flre rope, thus hoping to prevent the crowd from in
terfering with the firemen. I Mso detailed several men to keep a strict
lookout for pickpockets and thieves, as I feared that they would attempt
to ply their vocation. Sergeant Martin and Police Officer Sylvester imme
diately aft^r the flre was discovered, entered the building and assisted a
number of guests in getting out of the place. Had it rtot been for their
efforts I am convinced that more lives would have been sacrificed. Some
of the officers even risked their lives to save the heliless guests who were
not aware of their danger. There wtre several Instances of the police car

A RELIC OF THE
OLD BONANZA DAYS
Of Handsome Appearance but
Always Regarded as a
Fire-Trap.
The Baldwin Hotel, like the Palace, was
one of the many projects that was car
ried out by those who made fortunes
during the great bonanza days of tne
early seventies. The building: of the Bald
win was contemporaneous with the erec
tion of the Palace, the latter going up to
its massive dimensions under the direction
of the late William C. Ralston and the
former under the eye of E. J. Baldwin.
It was in the early part of 1872 that
"Lucky" Baldwin, with a view to placing
on Market street what he declared woultl,
from an architectural point of view, be
one of the finest buildings of the times,
set about to find a site upon which to
erect the building, which, after being
opened as a hotel, became worlu re
nowned. After a long survey of what he
thought would be a suitable site, he se
lected a part of what at one time in the
history of San Francisco was known as
St Ann's Valley. In fact, it was the
eastern boundary of the valley, and for
many years on the opposite side, on which
stands the St. Ann's building, there was a
nursery from which thousands of bou
quets were furnished to the fasnlonable
people of the city. He selected the
ground on the east side of Powell street,
running eastward to where now stands
the Baldwin Annex, taking in the entire
frontage on Powell and on Market and
Ellis streets. The site was covered with
several frame structures of fair preten
sions and a number of old structures that
were hurriedly erected when the people,
afte? the breaking out of the War of the
Rebellion, commenced to desert Kearny
and Montgomery streets north of Cali
fornia and also the cross streets.
Mr Baldwin, with that luck which was
proverbial with him, and which won for
him the sobriquet by which he is known
al l over the land, purchased piece after
piece and secured much of the property
at what was then considered reasonable
figures for. at that time there were but
few who even dreamed that Market street
would become the great thoroughfare it
In since become. notices on all the ten-
In 1573 he served notices on all the ten
ants to vacate and then one by one the old
structures came down. The only ones
saved were the more pretentious buildings
and they were moved westward by the
owner, who located them on other prop
erties 'owned by him. Then commenced
the work of clearing the ground for the
foundation, and in the removal of the
sandy soil there was encountered a spring
which was one of the many that were the i
result of seepage of the rains of winter,
and which flowed from the west into ,
Hayes Valley, percolating '.lie sand In that
direction and also in the direction of Mar- ,
ket and Seventh streets, at present the ;
site of the Odd Fellows' building. This
spring was the source of considerable
trouble In the work of laying the founda
tion, but the annoyance caused was over
come' and the building progressed.
While it was in process of erection there
were many who expressed the opinion ;
that it was "only a fire trap." Still it I

mansard roof and then came the plaster
and the paint, which hid from view the
really flimsy material of which the build
ing was constructed.
ft was finished and presented a fine ap
pearance, and "Lucky's" fondest hope
was realized. He had one of the hand
somest buildings on Market street.
There was one man in San Francisco
who did not have a good opinion of the
hotel, and that was the late David Scan
nel, Chief Engineer of the Fire Depart
ment. Standing one. day in front o^the
hotel after it was in full operation j.e
said to a friend: "That building is a
menace to Market street. If a fire ever
breaks out in it all hâ won't be able to
stop it. While [ have charge of the de
partment and a fire breaks out in" it I will
not allow one of my men to enter It. I
will fight it from the outside; that's
what I'll do, sir."
He also had a standing rule .while he
was in charge that if an alarm came in
from box 47. which was known as "the
Baldwin box," and it should i happen that
the fire was in the hotel, that a second
alarm should be sent in immediately so
as to bring the entire department to the
spot. "What I want to do in ca.se of a
fire there," he paid, "is to confine the fire
to that building."
Dave Scannel did not live to see a fire
in the hotel, but when it did occur the re
sult shows how prophetic was his words.
The hotel was opened with great eclat
in 1575, and about the same time the
Academy of Music was { opened by Tom
Maguire. the Napoleon of San Francisco
stage managers. Subsequently the name
of the place was changed to the Baldwin
Theater. :
Yesterday E. J. Baldwin stood In the
doorway of the Annex looking sad as he
realized the loss which had befallen him.
When a word of condolence; was "spoken
.to him he replied in a sad voice. "It is
one of the events that one must expect in
the course of a lifetime."
THEY TOOK NO
TIME TO ARGUE
The police did meritoriously at the fire.
Immediately after the first alarm was
sounded Sergeant Martin, with a posse of
officers, was on the scene, assisting the

tin, accompanied by Policeman Sylvester
and Special Huey Smith, went through
the burning structure awakening the in
mates and assisting them in getting out.
On account of the electric current being
shut off the place was in total darkness.
The officers were supplied with candles,
and with this dim light they went to each
room and aroused the sleeping inmates.
One woman, who had not felt tne ex
plosion, was peacefully sleeping in her
room when the officers rapped on her
door. After informing her of her danger,
as she did nut show any inclination to
leave the hotel. Martin and his men
broke down the dour. She seemed to be
in a stupor, and without waiting to let her
dress herself the officers picked her tip
and carried her downstairs. A citizen,
noticing her preuicament. took off his
coat and wrapped It around her. Subse
quently she was tnken In charge by a
friend, who escorted her to a lodging
house on Ellis street.
INCIDENTAL TO
THE CONFLAGRATION
Remarkable Fortitude of
Women in the Burning
Building.
J. C. Walker, thf- Fresno capitalist,
â with his wife and daughter, Miss Lottie
Ruth Walker, occupied rooms on the fifth
floor. Mrs. Walker, thoughful of the ad
vanced age of her husband, urged him to
hurry on before her and their daughter.
Mrs. Walker, with unusu.il fortitude,
stopped to dress, and Miss Walker not
only got her clothes on, but managed to
save her sealskin sack. Mr. and Mrs.
Walker were carried down to the land
ing on tho elevator.
The Walkers were on their way to Hon
olulu and lost property worth $2000.
Miss Minnie Sullivan and Miss Emily
yon Blomberg. both chambermaids In the
hotel, occupied adjoining apartments in
the cunola at the Powell and Ellis street
end of the hotel. Miss Sullivan mourns
the loss of all her personal effects and a
trunk containing $500. the accumulated
I earnings of many years of service.
Mies Katie Hart, Miss Kate Richardson
and Miss Gussie Johnson, the three
young women who owe their lives to the
bravery of J. L,. White, escaped without
a scratch.
The first stuff removed from the burned
building were the trunks and valuables
of Mrs. T. C Black and Mrs Jones, who
occupied room 102. About $2000 worth of
jewelry was recovered, and a sack con
taining nuggets and gold coin to the
I value of $IiUO was found in a locker.
Starter JamesCaldwell wasa heavy loser
by the fire. He escaped with nothing but
an old suit, leaving behind $70 in coin and
a small fortune In jewelry.
! John Morrieey, manager of the Orpheu...i
i Theater, occupied a room on the Powell
i and Market street corner of the i_aldwin
i Hotel, and when the tire broke out had
I an experience which he docs not care to
! have .repeated. At first Jje did not re

' man to stand at the door or. his room and
see that he was safely out of the building.
i As he assisted bis wife along the corridor
the flames broke through tne walls, and
for a moment it seemed as if every avenue
of escape had been closed. Piloted by a
messenger boy he finally made i.is way
to the entrance.
"My losst-s will amount to more than
$10 000," he said. "There were articles
destroyed which had been the result of
i years of search and travel. We saved
I practically nothing." 9

To the t'mely arrival of Police Officer
F G Howard of the Central station the
roomers on the third floor owe their lives.
Howard was on his beat on Webgigr.
Ftreet when the ft re bell attracted his at
tention and on looking eastward he saw
the sky light up with trie, reflection of tne
burning building. On arriving at the hotel
he at once dashed into the building, and
finding no person giving the alarm on the
third floor ran along the hallway and
kicked on every door.
During the afternoon and while the men
from tho fire patrol were searching the
burnt building for such property as had
not been destroyed Fire Marshal To we
found In one of the rooms a hand satchel
such as might be carried by a physician.
Among its contents, in which there was a
small sum of money, was a card with the
name of "Dr. J. Stow Ballarci, ClO Hyde
telephone number, E 30(8." Dr. Mallard
said the satchel was not his, nor did he
know to whom it did belong; he had not
been staying at the Baldwin Hotel.
One of the fortunate Individuals who re
covered his property before the lire
reached his room was Jack Quinn, the
horseman. When aroused from sleep he
rushed to the street without stopping to
dress or secure his valuables. When he
reached the office he remembered a large
sum of money he had left In his trunk and
offered $100 reward for its recovery. The
night porter of the hotel rushed up the
stairs through the smoke to Mr. Quinn's
room. He got the trunk containing the
money and started back. While the porter 3
was in the room the fire had gained great I
headway in the corridor and he barely i
escaped with his life. He reached the top j
of the stairs on the second floor and sank <
exhausted to the floor. Several men who
heard his cries for help dashed to his res- ]
cue and succeeded in dragging him down i
to safety just In the nick of time.
Barmy Schrelber. the well-known horse- r
man, occupied a room on the third floor <
of the Baldwin, fronting on Powell street. \
His experience was similar to that of the 1
other guests, except that he was one of t
the later ones to get out and was almost 1
overcome by smoke before he reached the ]
stairway. Mr. Schreiber was only scant- <
lly attired when he reached the street. <
Yesterday afternoon two men climbed up J <
the flre escape to Mr. Schreiber's room
and recovered his trunks and valises.
Everything in thf> apartmÂ°nt was ruined
by water and smoke. Barney says his loss
does not amount to much.

morning. When the fire was discovered
he saw it was useless to attempt to extin
guish the flames. Buckley ran to the up
permost floor, where the attaches of the
hotel were quartered, and his herculean
efforts to arouse the sleeping inmates
saved scores of lives. He remained on the
top floor until his own life was in danger
and then went to the floor below. He ran
through the corridors knocking at each
door and calling loudly to any one who
might not have already escaped. WhÂ°n
the electric lights went out he stood at
the heart of the stairs and continued to
call "This way. Stairway is here. Come
this way." This he repeated from floor
to floor, only descending toward the
ground when the flames almost enveloped
him.

Captain Hock's Theory of the
Origin of the Baldwin fire,
"We are convinced that the fire started In the kitchen on the
Ellis-street side." said Fire Marshal Cnmstnpk last evening. "When
we turned out ttl New Montgomery street the flames were already
bursting through the roof. They were sucked up by the elevator
shafts and the building was fired on every floor.
"It is the biggest and costliest fire this city has had in year*, and
it was one of the hardest to fight that has come within my experi
ence ' AH the fire wagons in America would have made no more im
nresrion on it than we did. We had plenty of watar, the men of the
department worked splendidly, there was no mishap to the apparatus .
and there was no wind, and yet all we could accomplish was to keep
the fire confined in its original limits. _ "{., _

evidently came from the theater, and the

MISS PERRY LOST
ALL HER CLOTHES
She and Her Mother Had
a Lucky Escape From
Danger.
Mis<^ Perry, leading lady of the "Se
cret Service" Company, was one of the
victims of the Baldwin ftre. With her
mother she had apartments on the fourth
floor. Both had retired after the theater
and slept peacefully until frantic blows
upon the door brought them out on the
floor.
They did not know who warned them.
! but from Misa Perry's account of the
] occurrence, he was "a gentleman," and
after he had helped them down through
the smoke and cinders he disappeared
without giving his name.
"We were frightened, of course," said
, Miss Perry, "but I was not so badly
, frightened as 1 supposed I would be under
such circumstances. It was not so bad
as a tornado. I don't know what would
have become of us if that man had not
warned us of the danger. We had no
! time to dressâ we just threw on old skirts,
and then we had to run.
"We came down here to the Palace at
once and we wul have to stay here until
we get more clothes. We lost every stitch
wh hadâ several hundred dollars' worth â
but otherwise we escaped. I took my
money but nothing else, f will have some
more stage clothes by Monday and will be
ready to go on again then. Beyond the
loss of our clothes neither my mother nor
myself suffered at all by the fire. It was
a narrow escape for us."'

Then he emptied the contents or a

Telegram Sent From
New York.
CAME TO WESTERN BETTORS
MEANT THAT THEY SHOULD
BACK SHARKEY.
Evidence That the Fiasco of Tuesday
Night Was Planned With Intent
to Defraud the
Public
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. ' Nov. 23.â the rage
'vented to-day by lovers of sport there
, were few pleasant words and these
! were all far "Hoaiest John" Kelly, who,
I voicing the pubffic belief that James J.
; Corbett lost ito Thomas Sharkey by a
; prearranged foill. prevented further
swindling by declaring ail bets off.
. But Kelly, could , not make 1 the com
plete reparation due to thousands who
j paid willingly to see what they, were
'led "to believe wocld be a battle royal
; at the Lenox Athletic Club last night.
He could net give back nor order re
stored the ; $47, that was paid Into
â  the pockets of the men who managed
: this, one of the most flagrant pugilistic
â¢ outrages ever perpetrated on a sport
' loving community. That money is in
the pockets of somebody and to the
knowledge of that fact is added the be
lief growing stronger every hour that
thousands of dollars more were spent
by somebody before "Connie" McVey
jumped into the ring and made Corbett
an instant loser by his action. For
proof the public looks in many places, i
but in none can it find stronger evi
dence than that found to-day. Men
who were betting their money on Cor
bett sent three telegrams westward.
One went to Seattle, another to San
Francisco and another to Portland, j
Or. The telegram was to a supporter
of Corbett and read:
â¢ + â¦â¦>â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â â¦â â â¦â â¢:
â¦ â¦
-f "Arrangements changed; -f
â¢4- hedge your money." +
Was there conspiracy? From dozens
of sources evidence pours in to prove
that there was. Who was in it? The
public asks 'â¢Connie" McVey to give it
evidence as to that, but it is not de
pendent on any statements or confes
sion he may make ttf turn what was
its suspicion into what now is its firm
belief. Only physical proof can make
those who were witnesses of the fiasco
believe that McVey, the trained fighter
of many years' experience, the cool
headed handler and adviser of pugilists
in action, quick-witted and self-con
tained, jumped into the ring without
being perfectly aware of the fact that
he was about to cost Corbett the de
cision.
McVey says he lost his head. There
are those who pay that $5000 would
represent the total value of the loss.
For this last statement Western book
makers are largely responsible, and
their statements throw more light on
the peculiar ending of the fight than
those of the angry men .>f New York.
Thousands and thousands of dollars
were sent to Western cities to be placed
on Sharkey. In San Francisco the
amount wagered on thÂ£ result was at
least $150,000. In Chicago $200,000 was
put up and half as much again was dis
tributed among other cities far removed
from the scene of the bogus battle.
In all these places the confidence of
Fhrewd men in Sharkey was so wonder
ful that suspicion was the natural out
come. They could not be risking their
money using the "form" of the fighters
as a base of judgment. They could not
be favoring Sharkey because of his
wonderful science. They did not turn
against Corbett because he had fallen
off in skill so tremendously that they
could hazard fortunes against him.
Thr-y had their reasons, however, and
there was no limit to the money that
was offered to those who still kept
faith in Corbett.
These men received their tip direct i
from New York. They were agents of
Western bookmakers who were in this
city, and who, feeling around carefully,
beard whisper after whisper that Cor
bett's corner would be the losing one
on Tuesday night in some way or an
other. McVey showed the way it could !
be done. The crookedness was seen in I
the West before it was discovered by i
those whom the discovery cost $47,876.
Corbett was seen at his elegant and
luxuriously furnished house at 117 West
Nineteenth street.
"Really, I hardly know what to say
about the affair," he remarked. "No

WILLIAM E. ARTHUR
DIES AT PASADENA
Paralysis Ends tf)e Life of the
BrilliaQt Youog Lawyer and
Politician.
WILLIAM E. ARTHUR.
PASADENA, Nov. 23.â William E. Arthur died at his home on
South Orange Grove avenue at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon. About
a week ago he was stricken with paralysis, and from that time he
never regained consciousness. At times he would raise his left
hand to his head as if in pain, but that was the only sign of life
he gave. His right side was wholly paralyzed.
Since 1890 Mr. Arthur had been City Attorney of Pasadena, and
he was recognized as one of the best municipal attorneys in Southern
California. He came to Pasadena from Indiana in ISBB. In the last
campaign he managed the fight of Congressman-elect R. J. Waters
with his usual ability. He leaves a widow and a two-year-old child.
Mr. Arthur was a recognized leader in Republican politics, espe
cially since he presided at the State convention at Sacramento in 1896.
He was only 33 years of age. The entire community is saddened by
the passing of the brilliant young man.
one is so depressed as I am at the
action of McVey, which lost me the
fight."
"Jim, many think you yourself were
one of those in the job and bet on
Sharkey."
"Never in my life have I been ac
i cused of utter Ignorance. People gen
j erally, I believe, have given me some
credit for possessing some intelligence.
Now, with a spark of intelligence in
my brain, do you think I would have
so bungled affairs In such a way? I
think the mere fact that the actions of
â  McVey appeared so palpable is cvi-
I dence that I was not at the bottom
of it."
"Do you think McVey sold you out?"
"I cannot believe that he did. W T e
have been too close in our relations.
If there had been any funny business
on his part I would certainly have seen
some change in him while we were
training. I don't say that he didn't
sell me out. but I can't bring myself
to think that h<> did, for I have been
most liberal with him."
ROBBERS RAID A
MISSOURI BANK
i A Night Watchman Bound and
Gagged and May Die From
Exposure.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 23.â At Elsberry,
| Mo., sixty-eight miles north of here, on
the St. Louis, Keokuk and Northwest
â¢ crn Railroad, robbers made a desperate
i attempt to rob the Lincoln County
: Bank. It is not known how much, if
1 anything, they obtained. As a result of
rough treatment received from the rob
bers, John Wiseman Waters, the night
i watchman of the town, who is 60 years
!of age, may die. He was found at an
i early hour to-day, bound and gagged,
' lying in the open air, where he had
been left by the robbers. He was badly
| frozen.
When President F. H. Harvey arrived
at the bank this morning he found the
vault doors wide open. The safe inside,
containing $10,000, was closed and he
' was unable to open it. An expert safe
i opener was sent from here at the re
â  quest qf the bank officials. The St.
j Louis expert worked all afternoon on
'< the safe, but could not open it. He is
; emphatic- in the statement that the rob
! bers failed to open the safe. Another
expert was taken from St. Louis to
i night and is now at work on the safe.
Watchman Waters is still in a pre
carious condition, but may recover. The
bank was obliged to close for the day,
but will reopen Friday.
MORIARITY MAY NOT
BE THE RIGHT MAN
SAN BERNARDINO. Nov. 23.â Wells-
Fargo Detective J. B. Hume of San Fran
cisco has been here a couple of days en
gaged on the Daggett train robbery case.
He left this morning to personally work
over the scene of the hold-up. The im
pression is gaining with the authorities
that Moriarity may not be the right man.
Engineer Bunnell in his testimony at the
Coroner's inquest asserted that the rob
ber with the rifle tired a supposed signal
when the train stopped the second time.
The examination of Moriaritys gun shows
It was not used recently. Still there is
strong evidence against him. His prelim
inary examination will be held after
Hume's investigation.
No doubt the accomplice went to Dag
gett after the hofd-up, for the Sheriff
searched the country and found no tracks
leading from the place of the hold-up.
The second robber could have been cap
tured had some one remained behind when
the train pulled out, as the tracks Bhow
that the man returned, looked at his dead
comrade amd then started afoot for Dag
gett.
The authorities have been unable to
trace Eisler's past. It is known he did not
come from Los Angeles. The belief is
that he might have been connected with
the New Mexico hold-up at Grants, and,
after the gang broke up, wandered this
way. It is certain he was no workingman,
but an athletic, finely muscled man.

Claude Mac Donald, the British Minis
ter at Peking, will probably make the
following representations to the Chi
nese Government on the subjoined
points at an early date: â¢
1. The treaty powers will not recognize
the restoration of the regency on bo flimsy
a pretext as the ill health of the Emperor,
which Is not sufficient to justify a change
in the sovereignty.
2. The work of reform Btarted by the
ESmperor must not be suspended, not only
in the interests of peaed in the East, but
for the sake also of th% maintenance of
the Chinese empire.
3. It is contrary to the principles of hu
manity to visit capital punishment upon
political antagonists, and this practice
must be discontinued In future.
4. The Chinese Qovernment must take
greater precautions to prevent assaults by
natives on foreign residents in Peking in
broad daylight.
The British Minister is now conduct
ing negotiations with the Ministers of
the other powers on the subject, but no
decision has as yet been arrived at.
According to a telegram received by

BLANCO'S RESIGNATION
ACCEPTED AT MADRID
Captain General Spared the Duty of
Surrendering Cuba to the
United States.
MADRID, Nov. 23.â After the meeting
of the Council of Ministers last night It
was said nothing definite had been de
cided in relation to the subject of the
peace negotiations.
The Official Gazette publishes a decree
accepting the resignation of General Blan
co as Governor General of Cuba.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 23.â N0 surprise
is expressed in Government circles at the
news of General Blanco's resignation. It
is known that some time ago the general
sought to resign the office of Captain Gen
eral of Cuba, and he was induced to re
tain that post only by appeals to his pa
triotism. It is supposed that his pur
pose is to avoid what he may regard as
the dishonor of surrendering the Gem of
the Antilles to the United States. The
Captain General of the Philippines took
the same course. General Arolas, the sec
ond in command, is likely to have the un
pleasant duty of surrendering Spanish
sovereignty over Cuba. It is believed that
Blanco's action will not in any way af
fect the evacuation, save in the possibil
ity it contains of inciting trouble among
the Spanish troops.

TO RELINQUISH PHILIPPINES

Bios Continues to Play to the Gal

Commissioners Are Will

Special Dispatch to ThÂ» CalL
PARIS, Nov. 23.â At the request of
the Spanish Peace Commissioners there
was no joint session to-day, pending
instructions from Madrid. The date of
the next meeting is not fixed. ,
The postponement of to-day is re
garded as a hopeful indication that the
treaty will be signed. Although the
Madrid Government had not yet re
ceived the text of the American ulti
matum the Spanish obtained quite
enough by telegraph on Monday night
to enable them to instruct their com
missioners to retire, were such their in
tentions.
The belief was confidently expressed
by several of the American Commis
sioners, in conversation with the cor
respondent of the Associated Press to
day, that before the time expired for
the answer, namely, Monday next, the
Spaniards will acquiesce in the United
States' Philippine offer, and that ulti
mately the treaty will be signed by all
the Spanish Commissioners. It is true
that the course which Senor Montero
Kius, president of the Spanish Commis
sion, will follow is still uncertain, aa
he continues to "play to the gallery,"
but a leading member of the American j
Commission says he will sign with the
other Spaniards. In any case his place
on the commission will be speedily
filled by Senor Leon Castillo, the Span
ish Kmbassador here.
Senor Montero Kios sent a communi
cation to the American Commissioners j
last evening asking a number of ques- j
tions. The most important of them, j
and to get an answer to which the let- ;
ter was undoubtedly written, was |
tucked away in the middle of the let- j
ter. It asked, in effect, if the Ameri
cans really meant that the ultimatum
must be answered by Monday.
The Spaniards were assured that
such was the intention, and the an
swer has cleared the air.
A member of the Spanish Commis
sion to-day assured the correspondent
of the Associated Press that the next |
meeting of the commissioners will take j
place on Friday or Saturday, and that
Spain's answer then will be the last
she will make, and that it wilj be a
definite conclusion of the matter in
hand.
The utterance Is looked upon as in
[ dlcating that Spain will sign the treaty
I of peace.
.MADRID, Nov. 23.â A semi-ofilcial
note issued to-day contains an appeal
to the Spaniards to furnish assistance
to save the national credit "if they do
not wish foreign capital to be with
drawn from Spain." The note adds:
"Some people believe Cuba ounht to
assume her own debt, no matter In
whose hands is her sovereignty, be
cause she herself possesses the security
therefor in the form of the customs. If.
however, nobody will assume the debt.
Spain must pay what Cuba cannot, be
cause Spain made herself respon
sible."
Continuing the note reads: "With re
spect to the debt of the Philippine Isl
ands. Rpain must await a definite
treaty of peace in order to know what
conditions America will Impose upon
Spain through the Paris Peace Com
missioners."
NEW YORK, Nov. 23.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: In
view of Spain's financial condition it is
expected she will make an earnest ef
fort to have the United States increase
the SUm offered for the. archipelago and
for Ualan, and It may be that the Com
missioners of the United States will
slightly increase the sum fixed.
CLAIMS OF AMERICANS
CERTAIN OF PAYMENT
Those Against Spain for Damage
Done in Cuba Assumed by
the United States.
NEW YORK, Nov. 23.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Ameri
can citizens having claims against the
Spanish .Government are much grati
fied to learn that under the terms of
the ultimatum submitted by the Ameri
can Peace Commissioners the Govern
ment of the United States is to assume
responsibility for their payment. It is
impossible to give an accurate estimate
of the total amount of claims of Ameri
cans against Spain, but a Senate report
of April 12 shows that there were then
pending In the State Department claims
amounting to $24,000,000 for the destruc
tion of property of American citizens in
Cuba. Since that time many more
claims have been filed. Many of these
claims, of course, will be disallowed or
scaled down before they are paid, but
whatever the total amount of claims
finally allowed may be. It must be
add*d to the $20,000 000 offered for the
Philippines in estimating the real In
demnity given by the United States for
those islands.
IGLESIAS AT WASHINGTON.
Costa Rica's President and Mr. Mc-
Kinley Exchange Calls.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23. â President
Iglesias of Costa Rica arrived hero this
afternoon, and although traveling incog
nit" he was accorded a!l the honors be
fitting the visit of the President of a sis
ter republic. Colonel Carter of the adju
tant-general's office had met the Presi

to Washington. On their arrival here
they were met at the station by Colonel
Binpham as the personal representative
of the President, who escorted the party

Bourbons Have No Use for the Na

the Faker's New York
Journal.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DALLAS, Tex., Nov. 23.âCongress
man J. W. Bailey to-day gave a cor
respondent the following typewritten
statement embodying what he is will
ing to publish at this time on the issue
of the Democratic leadership in the
House of Representatives of the Fifty
sixth Congress:
"I do not entertain the slightest fear
about the result. The next House will
contain 101 Democrats, who are also
members of the present House, and out
of that number no man who may be
put forward as a candidate against me
can command over thirty-one votes. I
will receive at least seventy votes from
old members, which will leave me only
twelve short of the nomination, and 1
have already received voluntary assur
ance of support from more than that
number of new jpembers.
"The opposition to me comes mainly
from the New York Journal, and aside
from personal reasons, proceeds largely
from the fact that the editor and owner
of that newspaper is ambitious to be
come a maker and unmaker of Demo
cratic policies and leaders. He has re
cently promulgated what he calls the
Journal's national platform, which is
imperialism run mad, and knowing I
would not support its propositions he
desires to defeat me.
"For my part I am not ready to
recognize the right of the New York
Journal, or any man connected with it,
to make a platform for the Democratic
party, and am absolutely certain when
our party comes to adopt a platform
for itself it will be entirely different
from the one which Mr. Hearst is seek
ing to force upon it."

A Cleveland Lawyer's
Daring.
APPLAUDED BY THE BAR
SENSATION IN THE BURKE DIS
BAEMENT CASE.
Counsel for the Prosecution Makes a
Bitter Attack Upon the
Cuyahoga County
Judiciary.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CLEVELAND, Nov. 23.â After the
testimony of several unimportant wit
nesses In the disbarment proceedings
against State Senator Burke to-day the
attorneys of both sides announced that
all their witnesses had been examined,
and that they were ready to begin their
arguments.
Attorney Foran spoke for the de
fense.
Judge Blandin, one of the three pros
ecutors of the charge against Senator
Burke, arose to speak, as every one
supposed, in support of the charges and
in defense of Judge Dellenbaugh. In
stead of doing that the Judge made a
bitter and sensational attack upon the
whcrle bench of Cuyahoga County. He
said he knew the risk he was taking,
but he did not care. For some time the
ex-Judges and old and tried members
of the bar who listened to Blandin's
passionate utterances stood amazed at
his daring. Then they broke into
cheers. When Judge Blandin finished
they cheered and clapped their hands.
Judge Blandin declared it was the
bench which needed reforming from the
first; the elimination of rottenness
should commence with the bench. He
went into details and did not hesitate
to say he was talking about Judge \\ al
ter C. Ong and Judge T. K. Dissette.
He said it was a comparatively insig
nificant thins whether Judge Dellen
baugh were impeached and driven from
the bench or whether Vernon H. Burke
were disbarred. It was more impor
tant, he declared, to cleanse the benches
of the county so that property, liberty
and life might be safe in the hands or
the seven men constituting the ccurt.
It was one of the most sensational
speeches ever made by a lawyer in
Cuyahoga County. A decision may not
be reached for several days.
TWO LAKE SUPERIOR
STEAMSHIPS ASHORE
DULUTH. Minn., Nov. 23. â The
steamers Tampa and Arthur Orr are
wrecked on the north shure of Lake Su
perior. The two vessels represent
about $450,000 with their cargoes, and
they lie within nine miles of each other.
The Tampa, Duluth-bound, with coal
from Buffalo, is a complete wreck on
the rocks at Beaver Bay. sixty miles
east of Duluth. She went ashore about
2 o'clock Tuesday morning in the fear
ful pale that swept Lake Superior all
of Monday and Tuesday. Her crew is
safe at Beaver Bay. The Tampa was
owned by David Whitney of Detroit.
She is a total loss and was Insured for
$100,000. Her cargo was insured for
JBOOO.
The tug "W. P. Castle returned to
nisrht from the scene and brought news
of the wreck of the Arthur Orr at Bap
tism River, nine miles east of the
Tampa. She went on at about the
same time the Tampa was wrecked. She
is not in as bad shape as the Tampa,
although she is broken in two. The
Orr left Duluth on Monday morning
just before the storm broke. She had
a cargo of flour and copper bound for
Buffalo.
The Orr is owned by C. "W. Elphlcke
of Chicago, and is valued at $150,000. A
wrecking expedition- will leave Thurs
day morning to rescue her if possible.

Miners Celebrate a Marriage.
RANDSBFRG. Cal.. Nov. 23.â One of the
happiest marriages that has ever hap
pened In Randshurg took place last even
ing at the Episcopal Church. The prin
cipals were William Maher, the president
of Miners' Tnion No. 44. and Caroline
Leo. The church was crowded with their
friends. After the ceremony the happy
pair were driven to .the Rand Band
Hall, where an elegant banquet was
spread. Hon. Frank P. Goodbody made
an address and in conclusion called for
three cheers, which were given with vim.
Hundreds of miners came in from all

TERRORIZE HAVANA
Aq Infamous BaQd of Desperadoes
Boldly Rob aod Murder in
ttye Streets.
HAVANA, Nov. 23.â Outside of the principal business streets in
Havana a veritable reign of terror has begun with the return of 400
desperadoes, members of the infamous band of Manogos sent to
Ceuta three years ago. The robbers do not await darkness to pursue
their profession, though by far the greater number of crimes are com
mitted at night These men work in gangs, which makes success of
opposition to their plans almost impossible. Indeed, the police have
found it cheaper to refuse to see their depredations. Yesterday two
members of the new force of civil police made an attempt to frus
trate the plans of four footpads. The only result of their temerity
was that the bodies of both policemen were in the morgue this
morning.
The alarming increase in vice and
crime renders it unsafe to walk the j
streets unarmed or unprotected after
nightfall. The police reports show
scores of "'hold-ups," murders, burglar- ,
ies and highway robberies, which never |
get into the local papers, thanks to the j
watchful censor.
Corruption, bribery -and wholesale;
stealing in the military and civil ad- I
ministration co-ntlnue unchecked. Some
insight Into the condition of municipal j
affairs can be gained from the report of j
a secret session held at the Mayor's of
flee on Monday. The regulation hours
for killing at the slaughter-house are :
during the afternoon, but a special per
mit entitles certain contractors to
slaughter one head each morning, for
which those who have the privilege
pay a prescribed fee. As a matter of
faot over a hundred head are killed
every day before noon, the fees for :
which, exceeding $250. never find their
way into the city treasury.
These beeves are distributed by the
contractors for the military hospitals ,
In the city at 55 cents per kilogram, j
while the public pays only the market |
price of about 38 cents. The difference
pei kilogram, together with the
amount of unpaid abattoir fees, is i
presumably divided among the select j
few, who silently defraud the city of j
a much-needed source of income.
At the secret Bession where this glar
ing abuse was under discussion a com

TREACHERY DISABLED
THE CRUISER BUFFALO
Machinists Ruined the Engines Be
cause They Did Not Wish to Be
Ssnt to Manila.
CHICAGO, 1 Nov. 2Z.~ A special to the
Tribune from WnshinÃton says: Chief of
Engineers Melville has received the re
port of the Board of Inquiry which has
been Investigating the circumstances sur
rounding the breaking down of the ma
chinery of the cruiser Buffalo, which was
â -rrned for Manila with about 300 sail
ors to relieve the men of Admiral Dew
ey'e fleet whoso terms of service had
expired.
ft is found that some of the machinists
on board of the ship have been guilty of
the basest kind of treachery and deliber
ately disabled the machinery of the ship
because they did not wish to be sent to a
statiun so far away from home.
The chief engineer of the Buffalo is ex
onerated because it is found he was not
in league with those who performed the
treacherous work. Further proceedings
will be had against the men who have
been found guilty of such an unpatriotic
practice, and they stand an excellent
chance of being sentenced to a long term
In the penitentiary.
CHILDREN'S MILITARY DRILLS.
Will Be Advocated at a Convention to
Reorganize the National Guard.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23. â Governor

to suggest and formulate plans for reor

favorable support from State Executive*.
mission was appointed to inform Cap
tain General Blanco of the fact, re- |
questing that the contractors be com- j
pelled to pay the arrears of fees since
July 24.
As already cabled, the Mayor of Ha
vana on his own responsibility, with
out the sanction of the City Council
and Board of Aldermen, increased the
city budget for the salaries of muni
cipal officers and employes from $34,000
to $54,000. The Board of Aldermen at
their last session resolved not to con
firm the Mayor's action, thus compell
ing him to pay the difference out of his
own pocket.
Street cars and omnibuses have paid
no taxes for several years. Although ]
strictly forbidden by law, more than
2000 wooden houses exist within the city
limits. Such cases of bribery, corrup
tion and maladministration could be
multiplied indefinitely. Nothing is done
to check them.
Gambling houses, which, after the
signing of the protocol, the Spanish au
thorities made a great show of sup- j
pressing, now flourish unmolested. At*j
this late day everybody admits the use- |
lessness of attempting to infuse moral
ity into the Soanish administration.
On November 18 the partially dis
banded guerrillas of Sagua la Chicha
took the field, burning tnd destroying
property. They did great damage on
the sugar plantation of John Harris, a
British subject. The British Consul,
Mr. Jerome, two days later filed a j
claim for damages, an acknowledgment i
of which has been made by Captain j
General Blanco.
The object of the convention will be to aid
the Government in placing the National
Guard on the most possible effective foot
ing. The Florida State Superintendent of
Education has extended invitations to Su
perintendents of Education In all States,
inviting them to this convention to con
sider the introduction of a military drill
system for public schools of the United
States in the interest of patriotism, sub
ordination and physical development.
The school board of Toronto, Canada,
will be invited to send a company of their
military trained schoolboys to the conven
tion. Chancellor McC'racken of the New
York University will address the State
Superintendents in advocacy of military
drills for pupils of the public schools.
PROSPECTING AT ATLIN
SUSPENDED TILL JUNE
Proclamation to This Effect Said to
Have Been Issued by
Officials.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 23.â There
is serious trouble in the new gold fields
known as the Atlin Lake District. E.
A. Dixon of the Northwest police ar
rived here to-day from Atlin with a
story that a proclamation had been is
sued by the Canadian officials suspend
ing: prospecting throughout the entire
territory till next June. The cause of
this is very apparent.
With the first stampede to the new
fields the boy recorder of the district
got "rattled " and matters are in a very
complicated state as a result. In fact
many miners holding the richest claims
on Pine and Wright creeks are in doubt
as to whether they will be able to hold
them under exciting conditions.
The confusion in the Recorder's office.
Dixon says, is terrible. Some thinking
that the Atlin district was in the
Northwest Territory took up claims in |
accordance with the mining regulations
of that region, while others recorded j
accordin*- to the mining laws of Brit
ish Columbia. There was no one there
to instruct them, and a most compli
cated condition of affairs has resulted.
The proclamation was issued to eive
the officials a chance to get matters
cleared up. Dixon thinks the country
will get a black eye for a while and
says the proclamation will result In
many throwing up everything and leav
in- the country.
Next spring and summer, however, he
predicts a tremendous rush to the dis
trict as it is known now to be very
rich. Atlin town, he says, will have
10,000 neo^le next summer.
Much Indignation is expressed here
at the tangled condition of affairs in
a district which coast cities look for
ward to as a second Klondike and con
sequently a big purchaser of supplies.

TO LABOR'S CAUSE
President Gompers of the American
Federation Calls Upon the
President.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 23.â Samuel Com- J
pers, president of the American Federa- i
tion of Labor, accompanied by the secre
tary of the Federation, had an hour's con
ference with the President to-day in re
gard to legislation in the interest of labor I
now pending in Congress. Mr. Gompers'
purpose was to obtain, if possible, the in
dnrst ment of those measures in the Presi
dent's forthcoming message to Congress.
The President was deeply interested in
Mr. Gompers' remarks and, without indi
cating what, if any, specific recommenda
tions would be made in his message on
these subjects, said that he regarded it as
the duty of every man, whether in public
or private life, to use every effort In his
power to improve the condition of the
workingman and to bridpe the chasm be
tween him and his employer.
Mr. Gompers favored the eight-hour la
bor law, which limits a day's work to
eight hours, whether the work is being
done directly by tho Government or by i
contractors, and the bill having for Us oo- I
ject the improvement in the condition of
American seamen. This bill gives to sea
men the right to leave a vessel when she
Is in safe harbor and abolishes corporal
punishment. He also urged the Lodge im
migrntion bill, which limits Immigration
to persons who can read and write, and
the convict labor bill, v.hieh prohibits the
transportation of the product of convict
labor from one State to another

del Rio, the capital of the province of
the same name, which is about 120
miles west of Havana, and is to be the
headquarters of the American army of

GOVERNMENT
FOR HAWAII
It Will Be Territorial in
Form.
BILL HAS BEEN COMPLETED
COMMISSIONERS CONSIDER SOME
OF THE MINOR DETAILS.
Franchises Will Not Be Extended to
Chinese or Japanese, and the
Contract Labor System Is
to Be Abolished.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â The com
; mission appointed by the President to
recommend a form of government for
the Hawaiian Islands as a part of the
United States met in Senator Culloms
committee room at the Capitol to-day
J for the first time since leaving Honolu
| lv, Senators Cullom and Morgan, Rep-
I resentative Hitt and Judge Frear being
present.
The meeting was devoted to discuss
ing details of the bill and the report
which the commission will present to
Congress, which had not been fully de
cided upon at the last meeting. The
legislation which will be recommended
by the commission will be included in
a bill, which to all intents and purposes
will be an enabling act and very much
like the bills providing for the admis
sion of new States into the Union, ex
cept in the one important detail that it
provides for the admission of a Terri
tory and not a State.
The bill has been completed, but
probably will be amended somewhat in
detail. The report has not been com
pleted, but the commission has decided
upon its important features. One of
these is a recommendation that the sys
tem of importing laborers under con
tract shall be discontinued. The com
missioners have concluded that as the
system is contrary to the laws applying
to this country as a whole, it would not
be wise to continue it even temporarily
in Hawaii. It is understood that a ma
jority at least of the members of the
commission do not accept the theory
that Americans and Europeans cannot
do manual labor in the islands.
The commission will recommend a
regular territorial form of government,
with a Governor, a delegate in Con
gress and a Legislature. The Legisla
ture will be elected by the qualified vot
ers of the islands, but there will be
property and educational qualifications
imposed upon those who vote for mem
bers of the upper house of the Legisla
ture. The franchise will not be extend
ed to the Japanese or Chinese in the
islands, but the Portuguese who be
come citizens will not be excluded under
tho restrictions imposed.
Judge Frear, one of the Hawaiian
Commissioners, and also a member of
the Supreme Court of Hawaii, said this
afternoon in answer to a question as to
the solution of the coolie labor problem
in Hawaii:
"Under the present law coolie labor
can be imported. Our people, If left to
their own choice, would prefer to con
tinue this system, but we will not hesi
tate to give It up if required. We real
ize that the stability of the Govern
ment will be so largely increased under
annexation that we could afford to
amend our labor laws and sacrifice
cheap labor. As a matter of fact, our
planters are now starting in to make a
serious attempt to introduce white la
borers. Some have already been
brought in from California, and it is
believed the experiment will succeed.
The notion seems to prevail in some
quarters that white men cannot work
in the tropics. It must be remembered,
however, that there are differences in
tropical countries. Hawaii really is on
the edge of the tropics. Furthermore,
the islands are tempered by a cool
ocean current, which reduces the tem
perature 10 degrees below that of other
countries in the same latitude. A great
proportion of the best coffee lands are
located in a very temperate zone."

Cannon Talks of Future
Work of Congress.
MONEY NEEDED FOR THE ARMY

ULARS ARE REQUIRED.
The Nicaraguan Canal Will Be Built
and It Will Be Dominated by
Uncle Sam's Gov
ernment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â "We will
begin work on the deficiency appropria
; tions at once, and have the measure
ready to report to Congress after it
| meets," said Representative Cannon
j upon his arrival in this city.
""The last session 'of Congress made
appropriations for six months for an
army of 250,000, and it will be neces
: sary to begin at once to provide for
money for the maintenance of that
I army.
"We will legislate on the basis of the
regular army, which will be necessary
for the future to maintain garrisons in
the territory which has been acquired
by us. We cannot expect the volun
teers to remain in the service on garri
son duty, and we will have to provide a
regular army of at least 100,000 men.
"The appropriations for the coming
session will approximate $500,000,000,
and as those for the last session were
about $800,000,000, the total appropria
tions for the session will easily exceed
a billion dollars.
"The Nicaraguan canal will be built,
and it will be dominated by this Gov
ernment, but as the negotiations ap
pear to be silently mixed I do not pro
pose to discuss the merits of each of
the syndicates and am not prepared to
say what will be done, but recent
events have demonstrated that the
construction of such a waterway will
be begun in the near future.
"We will have more work than can
be done at this session of Congress, but
I do not believe there will be an extra
session. Porto Rico and Cuba will re
main under military control for at
least a year, until we can find out what
kind of a government is required and
determine if the people of those islands
are capable of governing themselves."

Colonel Roosevelt Piomises to En-
force New York Statutes.
NEW YORK, Nov. 23.-- Oovernor-elect
Roosevelt has held a conference with sev
eral labor officials and other men inter
ested in social And economic problems
There were present Henry White general
secretary ot the United Garment Workers
of America; William P. IVrflinper of
Typographical Union No. 6; Henry' Weiss
man, ex-secretary of the International
Bakers Union; James Reynolds general
secretary of the University Settlement-
George Gunton, editor of a periodical de
voted to economic questions, and others
Colonel Roosevelt expressed the opinion
that it will he best to enforce the exist
ing statutes affecting the labor problem
rather than to make new statutes He
agreed with his visitors that the factory
inspection department should be the chief
means of improving the workshop con
ditions in the matter of sanitation and
child labor.
The Governor-elect's attention wns
called to the fact that the ten-hour law
for surface street railways Is almost
totally ignored. Colonel Roosevelt ox
pressed himself forcibly on this subject,
and favorably received the suggestion
that this law should be enforced by tne
State factory inspection department.
Colonel Roosevelt assured the labor offi
cials that he would enforce every statute
bearing on the labor question.

SALINAS, Nov. 23.â Information of a
definite character has been received
that the underwriters of the Monterey
and Fresno Railroad bonds in the East
have signed, sealed, approved and de- |
livered the contract for the construe- |
tion of that road from Monterey to Hol
lister.
E. C. Darrow, superintendent for the
contractors, the California Construc
tion Company of San Francisco, has
been in this vicinity since last Thurs
day and has purchased all the piles ob
tainable, whioh had been saved from
the great rafts which broke up at sea
recently. At Moss Landing, East Santa
Cruz and Monterey 200 piles were pur
chased. The old Washington Hall at
Monterey has been rented and is being
fitted up for men's quarters and sta
bles. It is semi-ofneially given out that
work on the wharf at Monterey will
commence on December 1.
Surveyors have been passing over the
line frequently of late and active oper
ations are looked for all along the line
just after the new year opens. All the
necessary right of way through San
Benito County has been secured, and
steps have been taken toward getting
the right of way through the Salinas
Valley and this city. No difficulty is
looked for, as the consummation of the
enterprise would be of the greatest
benefit to this section.
EXPANSION OF MARKETS.
Charles S. Adams on Trade and New
Colonial Possessions.
BOSTOX, Nov. 23.â At the annual meet-
Ins of the Massachusetts State Board of
Trade President Charles S. Adams said:
"The war being practically ended labor
and capital have a right to demand that
their interests shall not be jeopardized or
prosperity further delayed by any doubt
ful territorial expansion. Trade will fol
low the flag only as we are able to meet
competition of other nations and we can
not deny them commercial rights to our
colonial possessions without expecting to
receive the same treatment in return.
What this country needs is market ex
pansion for our products and the best way
to secure that result is by making known
to all markets that we manufacture and
can furnish the most desirable and best
g-oods for the money that are produced
in any industrial center."
President Adams referred to the loss
suffered by the United States in having
freight and passengers carried to foreign
countries in foreign vessels and said that
our statesmen ought to find the remedy
and speedily apply it to the expensive
cvii. He also recommended that the Mas
sachusetts State Board of Trade continue
its efforts to bring about the establish
ment of the National Department of In
dustry and commerce.

THUGS OF THE RING.
THE prize-ring is a disgrace to the country. Tol
eration of it has bred a race of muscled
vagrants, petty confidence men; has lowered the
general moral tone of more than one community;
has been productive of no good- The pugilist is a
public burden, too lazy to work, too uncultured for
professional life and lacking in courage to become
a highwayman. 'When not in training for some event,
which when it does come ofl is a fiasco, he naturally
drifts to association with criminals and outcasts.
There should be an abatement of the professional
pugilist < Hher nuisances far less obnoxious are
abated. Garbage goes to the crematory; thieves to
jr.il. Why this exception in favor of the pugilist, who
is more of a menace to humanity than the inert offal
oi the rogue who gets caught?
Theoretically there may be some excuse for prize
fighting. In reality there is not. It does not stimu
late decent people to healthful exercise, but it opens
to a lot of pluguglies an easy way in which to make
a living. There are laws against prize-fighting, but
they are so constructed that locally the Supervisors
can override them; and the Supervisors do. They
have on more than one occasion been bought for a
seat close to the ringside.
Upon the Legislature will rest the duty of so chang
ing the statute t that it cannot be defied by lawless
Supervisors and other "promoters." Every person
encouraging one of these illegal affairs by his presence
should be arrested and heavily fined. Every principal
should be sent to the jail or the chain gang. Every
official conniving at it should be deprived of office.
Prize-fighting, so far at least as California is con
cerned, must stop. It has been borne with too long.
It has brought odium enough upon the common
wealth.
A general discussion of the prize-fight in the ab
stract is not here necessary. We even pass over
inquiry as to why anybody should care which of two
ruffians can whip the other. It is enough to say now
that the "sport." brutal and useless as it would be
if conducted honestly, has degenerated into a swindle
and an outrage. Let it be stopped. Any fistic contest
more than a friendly bout at an athletic club, no
admission being charged and no prize offered, should
be regarded as an offense and rigidly punished. The
duty of the Legislature on this subject is clear, but
from time to time an effort may be made in these
columns to illuminate the clarity. It is time for the
Corbetts and Sharktys to actually earn a living by
some method of toil to which their limited intelli
gences adapt them. Yet they are not wholly to be
blamed. The burden of guilt rests with those who
have the power to stop the disgusting fakes and fail
tc do so.
QUICK WORK WELL DONE.
THE work accomplished by The Call in reporting
the Baldwin Hotel fire merits notice as a strik
ing illustration of what a modern newspaper can
accomplish when directed by energetic men and
equipped with up-to-date machinery.
The first alarm was turned in at 3:10 a. m. Tlirr
Call obtained a report of the fire and published it in
the Oakland edition, which was sent out at 4:25 a. m.
Thus the news was gathered, written out, printed and
published in seventy-five minutes. The Call was the
only paper in the city that gave the news in its regular
Oakland edition.
At 5:59 the city edition was issued with a full page
account of the fire, and at 7:03 an edition containing
a complete report up to the time the fire was extin
guished was published.
The record, it is to be noted, was made for quality
and accuracy of the report as well as for speed. It is
one of the many proofs The Call has given that it
has the men and the machinery to meet and master
every emergency that arises.
The Anglicized Astor denounces as a lie the story
that he made a wager concerning the size of the
section of redwood procured from California. He has
need to get excited. Nobody ever believed it was
anything else.
Somehow the police reporter fails to state whether
these fellows who attempt suicide on "account of de
spondency" feel any payer after a stomach-pump has
wooed them back to the discomfort of living.
Uncle Sam, with Aguinaldo across his knee, a
shingle in his hand and an expression of determina
tion on his face, would form a fitting picture illustra
tive of the situation in the Philippines.
A wealthy man has been arrested for the theft of a
can of lard worth 50 cents. He ought to be ashamed.
There are cans of lard worth a dollar.
The Call will admit to being a little proud of the
way in which its young men handled the story of the
Baldwin fire.
Jacob Neff is one of the men who must submit with
what patience they can to having honors thrust upon
them.
THE LESSONS OF THE FIRE.
r^x ISASTROUS as was the fire that destroyed the
) Baldwin Hotel, the results would have been
* â far worse had not the brave and energetic
labors of the Fire Department been assisted by a
species of good fortune. Had the night been windy
there is no telling how far the flames would have
spread, or had a panic ensued among the startled
guests it is probable the victims would have been
numbered by the scores.
Full credit will be given to the arduous work of the
firemen and to the skill with which that work was
directed. Nevertheless, when the nature of the huge
building, the time of night when the alarm was given,
the number of persons sleeping in the structure and
the rapidity with which the flames spread are con
sidered, it will be seen that good reasons exist for
accounting ourselves fortunate that the damage to
property and the destruction of life were not appall
ingly great.
San Francisco cannot always count upon good
fortune to save her from the most direful conse
quences of such disasters as this. It behooves those in
authority, therefore, to study well the lessons of the
fire and profit by their teaching. They point an
emphatic warning against the toleration of fire traps
among the great structures in the crowded center of
the city.
A careful watch should be kept upon the construc
tion of buildings within the fire limits, and every
where upon all tall structures designed for habitation.
When the Baldwin was built it was outside the center
of the city, and fireproof construction was unknown
to us. No particular blame, therefore, can be placed
upon its construction; but the type which it repre
sented should not be permitted again in the business
portions of the community.
The lesson, moreover, should be acted upon at
once. There are reasons for believing the super
vision of buildings within the fire limits has been
carelessly done, and that buildings are now in process
of construction which are not even as good as was the
Baldwin Hotel. An examination should be made of
all these structures, and fire-proofing arrangements be
required before it is permitted to complete them and
ooen them for use.
It will be further worth while to give consideration
to the extent of the area within the fire limits. Since
the boundaries were adopted the city has grown, and
a considerable district left at that time outside the
limits should now be included within them. It would
be easy to point out structures now in process of erec
tion which are dangerous in their liability to fire, and
a menace to the property around them; and many of
these are in localities which if outside the fire limits
ought not to be so.
It is not likely that these lessons of the fire will be
overlooked. They were made too clear in the blaze
of the burning hotel and too impressive by the loss
of property and life. The only danger is that they
may be neglected by the city officials and permitted
to pass without profit. To avoid that danger, the
work of inspection of new buildings should begin at

see to it that the fire limits are made commensurate
with the danger area of the city and that all new
structures within that area are fireproof.
OUR NATIONAL THANKSGIVING.
IN accordance with a custom which has now become
firmly established, the American people will to
day turn from the toils and cares of their lives and
with joyous minds celebrate the annual festival of
Thanksgiving.
The institution is peculiar to ourselves. No other
people have such a festival on their list of public
holidays. In this land alone of all lands on earth
have all classes of people so large a share in the
profits of their labor and so fruitful a return for the
work of their hands that a yearly celebration of the
common bounty and prosperity is felt as a necessity
of their lives.
With each returning season the people find suf
ficient reasons for the celebration of the festival. We
have had droughts, industrial depressions, financial
panics, wars and many other forms of hard times;
but never yet has a year come without bringing to
us between seedtime and harvest such a bountiful in
come of good that the hearts of all could rejoice with
a genuine sincerity when the time came for the
Thanksgiving to be celebrated.
So steadfast has been our prosperity and so con
tinuous our blessings that it has become a common
place on each recurrence of the festival to find in that
particular year strong reasons why the celebration
should be more exultant than at any previous time.
This year will not be an exception to the rule. The
swift triumphs of our arms in a war for humanity,
the many illustrations of the heroism of our citizen
soldiery, the increased prestige which our republic
enjoys among the powers of the earth, the revival of
industry and the proof given by the elections of the
stability of popular sentiment â all these things can
be cited as causes for special rejoicings, and in each
case the citation will be just.
(ireat as are the causes for these special rejoicings,
however, it must not be overlooked that the pro
founder reasons for our Thanksgiving are to be found
ii- blessings which change not from year to year, but
are permanent in their nature, or at least are so in
herent in our social organization that they will remain
the heritage of the American people so long as the
people have the virtue to sustain the fabric of a
free government and a society in which the highest
rank is accorded to intelligent industry, intellectual
honesty and moral worth.
In the upbuilding of the republic our fathers have
accomplished more than the making of a great na
tion â they have made a great people. Among the
characteristics of our manhood displayed during the
war magnanimity and generosity in the time of victory
were not less notable than valor and strength in the
hour of battle. So also in the battle of life among us
the victors whose successes bring them millions fail
not to show a generous helpfulness to those against
whom the fortunes of battle have turned. Between
all classes of our citizens there exists the bond of true
humanity â a humanity which recognizes the right of
all and does justice to each, granting every one that
which his merit deserves.
While these republican virtues prevail among us
we shall not be without cause for rejoicing at each
returning Thanksgiving, whether there be peace or
war, good times or bad.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1898.
TO condemn racing as it is now carried on in this
city is not to condemn it when properly con
ducted. To maintain racing all the year round
is simply to kill the sport so far as every legitimate
feature of it is concerned.
Racing, ideally, leads to the breeding of good
horses, a healthful and pleasing exhilaration on the
part of spectators who love horseflesh, and a fair re
turn to the breeder. But, like some other sports,
racing has reached a low level. It has little left to
commend it. Morally it is on a plane with the wheel
of fortune or the shell game. Once it was an aid to
county fairs. Now it does much to ruin such events.
Once there was a possibility of judging by the known
merits of a horse his prospect of winning. That chance
has gone, so that racing, by inducing men to bet,
becomes a swindling operation.
One phase of the damage wrought by the con
tinuous performance on local racetracks may be ad
verted to here. It has ruined men without number.
It has sent â¢'trusted" employes to San Quentin or to
exile. Women have been caught by the fever of folly
and brought sorrow to their families and disgrace to
themselves. By frequenting the racetrack girls and
boys have beclouded their own characters. His pas
sion for gambling, aroused by the constant oppor
tunity afforded by the races, placed Theodore Figel
under the suspicion of murder and theft, and his old
father suffered pain and financial reverse. Welburn
sought the track, and somewhere in a foreign land, a
reward posted for his capture, Welburn is a fugitive.
Unable to flee, his cashier, ruined by the same means,
found such peace as the grave of a suicide affords.
Widber gambled on the races, and he will for seven
years be a felon in stripes, his reputation gone, his
future blasted.
Such are a few sample specimens of the work that
the racetracks have done for San Francisco. Yet,
as intimated in the beginning, there are methods and
limitations by which racing can be made a desirable
attraction. To define these methods and fix these
limitations is one of the tasks which will fall to the
Legislature. It is a task too important to be lightly
considered and one which must by no means be neg
lected. So rotten has the system in vogue become
that it will in the end, unless corrected, mean the
abolition of the speed contest. The racer better be
hitched to a dray than be used merely as a part of a
plan for duping the public and leading the inexperi
enced into temptation.
r FREDERICK TREVOR, who has been an
nounced with a flourish of trumpets as an "emi
nent London sargeon," has recently declared
that the human stomach has undergone no change
whatever since the earliest age to which man's exist
ence can be traced.
In the processes of development carried on by
evolution through long periods of time, the brain, the
muscles and even the bones of men have undergone
considerable transformation. The skull is larger, the
toes are shorter and arms and legs and lungs have
! all changed. The stomach, however, stands im
mutable. It is in the daintiest darling of to-day even
as it was in the troglodyte of the palaeolithic age.
Mr. Trevor considers that this stomach, which has
come down to us as a survival of the time when men
i lived on raw mastodons, is too large for our enlight
ened needs, and is a fruitful source of ills, because it
is abnormal to our civilization. He favors "the re
moval of a considerable portion of it," and says "ex
perience has shown that such an operation would
ensure greater comfort to everybody."
To the unreflecting man this topic may seem un
i timely to the occasion of Thanksgiving; but he who
i reflects for a moment will perceive that it is most
i pertinent and opportune. What greater joy and com
fort can we give to any American citizen as he sits
down to dinner to-day than this assurance on high
authority that the stomach with which he confronts
the turkey and the pie is the same vast, capacious,
devouring organ with which the cavernicolous giants
cf the time of earth's primitive vigor digested and
absorbed the rich juices and massive fibers of the flesh
' of the megatherium and the plesiosaurus, and after a
dream of Eden awoke in the morning to slaughter an
ichthyosaurus and have another feast?
Whether or not it may be better for us all to have
surgeons considerably reduce our stomachs at some
future time is another question. For to-day it is
sufficient to know they have not yet been reduced. In j
j the stomach we are yet equal to the primal demigods
who were strong enough to subdue the earth and its
beasts with their bare fists without the aid of imple- i
ments or weapons, and whose mighty appetites en
abled them to eat anything from a pterodactyl to a j
sea-serpent without the aid of cooks.
In this assurance let every American >to to his feast
to-day. Let him eat his turkey with joy and drink
his wine with a merry heart. And "may good diges-
I tion wait on appetite."
All honor to J. L. White. He died the death of a
hero. With every opportunity to save himself, he
chose to save others, and he fell a victim to his own
generous bravery. There is no greater heroism.
"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
down his life for his friend." And yet there seems
to be a greater love â the humane impulse to lay down
life for- a stranger speaks of a broader and more un
selfish humanity. Mr. White perished at the fire.
He went to death conscious that he had saved others,
an<* those who witnessed his acts will remember him
as a valiant and noble man.
A woman in New York committed suicide because
her husband objected to her riding a bicycle at night.
j The excuse appears insufficient. Still, her request
j that he take tender care of the pet dog, which she
could not take with her, ought to be heeded, and in
attending to the "purp" he may in a measure forget
his woes.
For once the whole town can say, "I told you so."

THE UNCHANGED STOMACH-
MILITARY RECORD
TO BE PROUD OF
THOUGH but 23 years of
age. Lieutenant Thomas M.
Anderson Jr., U. S. A., now
a guest at the Occidental,
has a military record of which
any war-scarred veteran might
well be proud. He entered the
Fourth Cavalry in August, 1894,
and, after successive promotions,
received his commission as lieu
tenant in June, 1597.
It was in the Thirteenth United
States Infantry, however, that he
won his laurelsâ leading the
charge up San Juan hillâper
haps the most notable as well as
fatal engagement of American
troops on Cuban soil. Of the 420
men in his regiment that took
the field, 109 were killedâ a larger
percentage of field loss than that
suffered by any other regiment
during the campaign.
"The road we traversed," he
said, yesterday, "was very nar
row, with high, dense and almost
impenetrable underbrush on either
side. The enemy, knowing that it
was the only road we could take,
had trained their guns upon it,
and were doing terrible execution.
Ahead of us were the Sixth and
Sixteenth regulars, and the Sev
enty-first New York Volunteers
all comprised in the Second Bri

WORTHY CASE
FOR CHARITY
Â® : Â®
fÂ». * Â©
Â® A PARTICULARLY sad case of destitution is that of a family by the Â®
~ /\ name of Strong at 1623 A Eddy street, in this city. It is a tale of an Â®
z: A-A unfortunate accident followed by absolute want and misery. It af- Â®
Â® / Â» fords an opportunity for the good offices of the charitably inclined. (5)
Â® and in these days of thanksgiving a small portion of the good Â©
Â® cheer which is bo widely disseminated would be well placed in this family Â®
Â® who have been so sadly afflicted. The case is all the more pitiful from the Â®
Â® fact that there Is a little babe of thirteen months, who, with the father Â®
Â® and mother, has often wanted for the barest necessities of life. Â©
Â® Last April A. L. Strong was almost killed by a premature discharge Â®
Â® of a dynamite blast in a mine at Chinese Camp, in Tuolumne County. He Â®
Â® escaped with his life, but at a terrible cost, for he suffered the loss of his Â®
Â® eyesight and hearing, the right eye being completely destroyed. His left Â®
Â® arm had to be amputated at the elbow and two fingers of the right hand Â®
Â® were carried away. He sustained other injuries, and is now utterly in- (â¢)
Â® capacitated from earning a living for his little family. The doctor will (5
Â® perform an operation next April on the left eye, but the most he can hope Â®
Â® for is that his patient will be able to see about four feet away. Â®
Â® The Strongs came to this city and have been living in two scantily Â®
Â® furnished rooms since the first of the month. A Mrs. Glbeau paid a Â®
Â® month's rent, amounting to $8, and it will be due again on the Ist of De- Â®
Â® cember. Mrs. Strong, who is well-nigh distracted with the terrible calam- Â®
Â® lty that has befallen her, says that had it not been for the kindness of Â®
Â® some neighbors she does not know what would have become of them. She Â®
Â® is anxious to get work by the day to help support her afflicted husband Â®
Â® and Mrs. Gibeau has kindly consented to take care of the baby during Â®
Â® her absence, as the father is utterly helpless and hardly knows how to 9)
Â® take care of himself. /=*
Â® It Is a worthy case for charity, and in these prosperous times, when Â®

WEBSTER DAVIS
AND TliE FIGHT
It Is pleasant to turn aside for a mo
ment from the boastfulness and jeal-
o usy, the arrogance and self-esteem of
I certain public men, and contemplate
j the achievements of modest worth and
I unassuming merit. The Hon. Webster
Davis, Assistant Secretary of the Inte
j rior, has just illustrated for our en
lightenment and reassurance the possi
' bllities that are open to a man of real
I ability and worth who goes forth with
| out the meretricious aid of clamorous
announcement.
Mr. Davis has no clacque. He is en
veloped in no nimbus of manufactured
notoriety, nor aided by any accessories
of artificial reputation. Yet Mr. Davis
i has just concluded a tour of the coun
j try extending from Pennsylvania to the
Pacific Coast, and the harvest of his
oratory is Republican triumph all along
the route. In Pennsylvania, Ohio, In
diana, Kansas, Nebraska, California
j and Washington he has strengthened
the party by his eloquent and patriotic
appeals. Quay owes him for much of
his hard-won success against the most
powerful opposition he has ever yet
encountered. In Ohio Mr. Davis fought
a valiant fight with burning words
and sumptuous periods that carried
conviction to every doubting heart. In
Indiana he helped to perpetuate a Re
publican ascendancy, which, to say the
least of it, is abnormal and depends
upon most extraordinary and unusual
circumstances. In Kansas, where Mr.
Davis was especially active, the Popu
lists have been driven out of power for
the first time in many years, even Jerry
Simpson, the pow-wow of Medicine
Lodge, having gone down before the
storm of popular enthusiasm. In Ne
braska Mr. Davis was a most conspic
uous agent of the political revolution
which recovered t~e State tn Republi
canism by a remarkable majority. In
California Mr. Davis* party has swept
everything before it and in Washing
ton the tremendous majority which
sent Hon. J. Hamilton Lewis to Con
gress two years ngo has been extin
guished and that picturesque and most
attractive statesman has been retired
to private life.
No doubt it will be said by persons of
a certain mental h: :f that these are
mere coincidences. We shall neither
deny nor argue that ungracious point.
It is worthy of remark, however, that a
still more noticeable coincidence is dis
cernible in the situation â the coinci
dence of Democratic gains in almost
every State which Hon. Webster Davis
did not visit, and among nearly all the
communities which were denrived of
the stimulus of his oratory. Enough to
point out the facts and leave the coun
try to form its own conclusions. We
shall not say in so mrny words that Mr.
Davis is the only political apostle in
the land. We content ourselves with a
simple statement of the fact that his
itinerary has been converted into a trail
of Republican victory and leave to oth
ers the task of expl ining it upon any
hypothesis save that of his personal
magnetism, his contagious fervor and
his brilliant flow of language. â Wash

"Of the officers, two were killed

WELLS-FARGO
STILL EVADES
REVENUE LAWS
Test Case Filed by the
Attorney General.
A FINAL DECISION WANTED
CASE WILL BE CARRIED TO THE
HIGHEST COURT.
Notwithstanding Several Adverse
Decisions the Corporation Still
Forces the Burden on
the People.
Whether the people or Wells, Fargo A
Co. must bear the war revenue tax im
posed upon bilis of lading, receipts, mani
fests, etc., that pass through the offices
of the corporation named will be decided
in the near future in a suit filed yesterday
by Attorney General W. F. Fitzgerald for
a preliminary writ of mandate, to compel
the company to bear its share of the Gov
ernment's burdens. An alternative writ
of mandate was issued upon the filing of
the complaint, directing the defendant
corporation to make appearance before
Judge Troutt on December 9 and show
cause why the writ should not be made
permanent.
W. H. Anderson, Assistant Attorney
General, made the affidavit upon which
the proceedings are brought. He alleges
that under the provisions of the act of
I Congress providing for the raising of rev
' enue with which to carry on the late war
|it is the legal obligation of ail express
I companies to pay the tax. He further
avers that Wells, Fargo & Co. refuses to
comply with this obligation, and for this
1 reason the writ is asked.
Anderson, in building up his case, pre
! sented at Wells, Fargu's local office a
| package on October 19 last for transpor
; tation and the company refused to for
ward it unless a stamp was affixed by the
owner. This treatment on the part of the
corporation, the affiant avers, is accorded
all who present packages for shipment.
This amounts, he contends, to a violation
of the franchise of the corporation and a
breach of its duty to the public. It is
further seeking, by unlawful and evasive
acts, he avers, to escape bearing its share
of the internal revenue tax and to force
the burden upon the public.
The petition is similar to the one pre
sented to the State Supreme Court, which
that tribunal dismissed without prejudice,
holding that the case should be. entered
in the Superior Court. A new and impor
tant clause in yesteday's petition sets
forth that:
Affiant is Informed and believes . . .
etc., that defendant threatens and intends to
and Will continue its aforesaid unlawful, ex
tortionate and coercive acts, and threatens and
intends to and will continue to force the peo
ple of this State to hear the burden of defer. l
ant'a share of said internal revenue tax in the
manner and by the means aforesaid until di
rected ami ordered by this court to cease and
ntinue it? said practices, and to Issue its
Bald bills of lading, manifests and other evi
dences of receipt and forwarding, and to affix
thereto the internal revenue stamps required by
law at Its own r-r.*t and without any cost what
ever to the shipper as provided by law.
Attorney General Fitzgerald explains
that the suit is brought to make a test
case and secure a final ruling, which will
necessitate carrying the matter before the
United States Supreme Court. In a suit
tried in the Justices' Court Judge Harry
ordered judgment entered aj?alnst Wells,
Fargo & Co. The case was carried to tho
Superior Court and Judge Troutt sus
tained Judge Barry. Without doubt, in
asmuch as Judge Troutt is conversant
with the points of law involved, he will
hand down an opinion in the case shortly.
Then the line of appeals will be run unUl
ultimately the court of last resort is
reached and an opinion handed down for
ever determining whether or not a corpo
ration has a right to enjoy the privileges
and protection afforded by the Govern
ment and then refuse to support it when
it is in need of financial support. *

the McDonalds at the suggestion of W.
H. Eastland and others.
should be remembered that the
Mi Donalds used all of their con- I
â is and parasites as j
dummies. It made little difference |
to the deluded bankers how often!
or in what way these parasites j
For example, one of the j
M< Donairi .1 gents might be the mana- |
-â¢lent or controlling execu
f hall' a dozen different schemes.
In this way the McDonalds kept the j
â heir own affairs within a !
â  rie of dependent flatterers.
.ill explain the fact that certain
â  ji who were in the employ of the Me
lds wrote a series of most in
criminating letters bearing upon the
affairs of a dozen corporations.
The Alaska Company, as already
Indicated. was kept in its dan
grerou ace by the money
of the Pacific Bank. It, like every
thing: else the McDonalds touched,
turned to ashes. The letters of East
land and others demonstrate this fact.
The < !edar River Coal Company was
another wild venture, in which the
McDonalds sank tens of thousands of
dollars. The International Electric
Supply and Construction Company
was another vehicle in which to
drain the vaults of the bank.
The Madera Improvement Company has
a history of its own which The Call,
in proving its main accusations of con
spiracy, fraud and dishonesty, has not
found yet the necessity lo exploit at
length. The John Brown colony and its
affairs have been described at iength
without introducing minor letters that
are of Importance, but no of public in-
Many of the incidental trans
it tmns in the bank of Madera are de
scribed in occasional betters covering a
porind Âf over four years. The incep
tion, progress :inal c lapse of the
California Raisin Company have also
only been touched in outline.
The great transactions in real es
;n Madera and the manipu
lations of the men concerned in
lotions are also of im
portance, but not absolutely neces
sary to tho purpose of The Call in
demoi the allegations of theft.
The I Bank. +" Riverside
â â  \\'<.rks, the Riv-^rsido motor road
and the Colton Marble Works might
escribed with absolute thorough
. s far as the Pacific Bank is con
erned, hut the description would add
nothing to the prooof alrealy estab
;ished that deception, financial jugglery
bsolute deliberate theft mark the
â¢ nof the Riverside people, the
nalds and their agents.
A volume might be written with the
â  : Late to the Los Angeles
lc and cable railroad, but this vol
ume would not be necessary to em
phasize the proof that The Call has al
submltted that Moses H. Sher
man was a dishonest schemer, engaged
!n the business of bribing City Coun
cil?, corrupting Hank Commissioners
and cheating his own confederates,
Th.is volume would not make clearer
the fact that ex-Hank Commissioners
W. H. Kniprht and Charles Dunsmore
were in collusion with Moses 7 Sher
man and his thieving associates.
The record needs to be no more com
plete than it is to demonstrate that John
E. Farnum, who is now the manager of
iho Pacific Bank, was the abject tool
of his cousin, M. H. Sherman, and with
him used the Bank Commission as a
Hub with which to threaten the Mc-
Dmialds into the acceptance of abso
lutely worthless securities, stocks and
bonds. U is not necessary to go into
more than an outline of the connection
nf the Pacific Bankers with the San Di
ego cahl^ road and the National Bank
of that town. Sherman's crazy schemes
and absolutely dishonest manipulation
of the Phoenix street railroads known
'as the Valley Street Railroad Company
have already been described sufficiently
lin detail. The Mohawk Canal and Im
i provement Company, the Mohawk Val
ley orange Grove and Fruit Company,
the Californian Illustrated 'Magazine,
I the San Francisco Printing Company
and the Panorama Company were all
1 financial fakes, in which the McDon
â  aids, blinded by llat'ery and lured by
cupidity, squandered tlT 1 money of
; their depositors and stockholders.
In reference to each of these dishonest
! enterprises hundreds of letters were
written. From these letters the fact
becomes apparent that the managers of
the Pacific Bank were most dishonest
â  in their manipulations of the books of
their institution. Whenever a new en
terprise was launched and thousands
ilars were lost in it the McDonalds
would command their bookkeeper to
(hare.' the loss to some notoriously los
ing venture, such as the John Brown
j colony or the Californian Magazine or
! one of a dozen other schemes in which
i money had been dropped as if into a
bottomless sack. To illustrate these
'â  facts in detail is not necessary.
The public of this city already knows
, through the expose in The Call that
tliM McDonalds were ready at any time
and for any purpose to falsify their
, books and conceal from their creditors
and the Bank Commissioners the de
tails of their own dishonesty and the
corruption of their confederates. As al
ready indicated, there is among this
vast, occasional correspondence some
letters that are of timely interest.
There are some, there are many, that
; indicate very clearly how school boards
! are chosen, even if they cannot be
[ elected. There are many letters from
schoolteachers in this city, showing how
certain women in the department con
sume not a little of their time in poli
tics. The personality of these women
is not of general public interest, and
for that reason is not given by The
I Call. These women had nothing to do
with the wrecking of the Pacific Bank
or the People's Home Savings Bank,
and The Call declared that its purpose j
in this expose was to confine itself to
the main facts that give the story of
the destruction of these banks.
The interestingfact remains, however,
that in the latter part of 1892, preceding
the general municipal election of that
year, Dick McDonald and oneof his most
trusted agents possessed local political
power sufficient to secure the nomina
tions of a majority of the members of
the School Board from one of the great j
political organizations. It happened, j
therefore, that several prominent j
schoolteachers in the department who I
were on terms of close friendship with j
Dick McDonald induced him to name
some of their frjend3 as nominees for
School Directors.
There are scores of letters from j
lawyers, ministers, McDonald rela- j
tlves, newspaper men, merchants and j
others not dignified by professions, j
each asking for small accomma- j
dations, which invariably were given
and as invariably never repaid. There |
are letters from men and women in all
grades of society asking to have their j
names placed upon the payroll of the j
Pacific Bank or upon that of any crazy j
scheme in which the McDonalds were i
interested. There are letters from men !
begging Dick to get them out of jail, j
but that was before Dick got there him- !
self. There are epistles showing what j
I>ii k's agents did not do in their ef- I
forts to float worthless electric bonds i
and other securities in London, Liver- 'â¢
pool and Paris. In this miscellaneous
correspondence there is something of
pathos and humor, appeal and denun- |
ciation, satire and blackguardism, but I
they are essentially of a private nature, !
and for that reason are not published
by The Call.
Another of the parasites who fed |
upon the McDonalds was E. E. Par- j
sous, who secured an overdraft of j
many thousands of dollars from the I
bank and did what Dick commanded I
him to do in order to save himself from
the satisfaction of his obligations. I
Parsons as a matter of course was an j
abject, disgusting flatterer. The Me- !
Donalds would have no other persons !
around them except those that were
willing to stoop to the most humiliating:
servility. Parsons was involved in 1
many schemes with Dick McDonald. I
The young banker used this man for I
general utility purposes, sending him
all over the Pacific Coast and into the
Middle States on wild chases that cost j
B great deal of money and resulted in !
nothing.
Parsons outlined to Dick a gorge
ous scheme of supplying tremen
dous water power to Carson City and
li hting the town with electricity.
The International Electric Supply and
Construction Company was organized
and Dick McDonald squandered thou
sands of the funds of the bank in the
scheme. Parsons spent a good deal of
time at Carson City attempting to float
this scheme. Elaborate negotiations
were begun and continued with promi
nent electric firms, but nothing was
done. A great amount of material was
purchased and Parsons spent a very
enjoyable f'^v for which the depositors
of the Pacific Bank paid. The electric
scheme having proved a failure, as so
many had done before, Parsons started
around the country as solicitor in chief
for the Californian Illustrated Maga
zine.
He went from town to town, from State
to State, attempting to introduce the
magazine among the booksellers and
newsdealers. Expensive posters were
circulated and a great deal of money
was squandered, but nothing more ma

terlal than the satisfaction of Dick
McDonald'3 silly ambition resulted.
Parsons kept this absurd camnaign
going until after the failure of the
bank. He was in Chicago when the
collapse came on June 22, 1593, and from
there he telegraphed to his wife to give
absolutely no information, as he would
start for home at once. For a short
time after that Parsons lived upon the
bounty of Dick McDonald, and then,
like the other parasites, deserted him
for new fields.

IS NOW RAGING
AT HONOLULU
There Are 111 Cases in
the Hospital.

The First Detachment of the New
York Regiment Will Leave
Honolulu Next Week for
This City.
Major General Merrlam yesterday com
pleted his report of the administration of
the Department of Hawaii. This he will
forward to the adjutant general at Wash
ington this week. The report contains
some very interesting statistics as well a3
some pertinent suggestions made loy Gen
eral Merriam.
The latest report from Honolulu to this ;
department shows that there are 312 pa- j
tients in the general hospital at that j
place, and of this number there are 111 !
cases of malignant typhoid fever. The re- ;
port is from General King. He sailed for
Manila on the 10th of this month, leaving ;
I at Honolulu of his command of expedi
i tionary forces 160 in the general hospital.
This number is of course included in the
entire number now In the hospital.
General Merrlam in his report gives it
as his opinion that the city of Honolulu i 3
thoroughly Infected with typhoid fever.
He thinks that in a measure this is possi
bly due to the men that were sent from
here with the disease, who were taken oft
the transports at Honolulu and put in his
pitals there. While he does not so state.
General Merriam gives the inference that ,
in his opinion Honolulu is a thoroughly :
unhealthy place and not fit for the en- '
campment of troops.
General King's departure abandons
Camp Otis, and General Merriam says it
will not be again occupied by troops.
Camp McKinley has also been moved to
new ground and every possible sanitary j
precaution taken to insure the good health
of the. men.
The first detachment of the First New-
York Regiment will leave Honolulu inext
i week on the Australia, and the second de
i tachment will follow a week later on the
Alameda. If the last-named transport
i cannot bring all the members of the re-
I maining detachment, those that are left
wili f-ome on the Scandia. When the first
; detachment arrives here it will go into
i cam}) at the Presidio for about a week
until transportation to Now York can be '
i arranged for. The second detachment ]
' will also go into camp at the same place j
for a few days. General Merriam thinks
that the entire regiment will be forwarded
from Run Francisco in time to get home
I to eat their Christmas dinner.
The case of Private Aubrey D. Howard,
I Battery A. Third Artillery, who deserted ;
: from Fort St. Michael, Alaska, will come !
up for trial before a general court-martial
some time next week. The Roldler Is now
confined in the guard-house at the Pre
sidio and is new to the service. He was :
i recently arrested !n Woodland by the
Town Marshal, where he had returned to !
I his home. He was wearing his uniform at !
i the time. According to Howard's state
i ment. when he arrived In Alaska he began
to suffer with rheumatism, and he says j
the doctor told him that if he staid there
be would die. He claims that he thought !
that if he returned he could report to the
Presidio for duty. One day he took French I
leave and came home, but forgot to report i
to the Presidio at all, ro that at present
he is sojourning there in the guard-house
waiting for his trial.
Private Tuthill of the engineer corps,
who was judged to be insane, was taken

SUPEBVISOBS' COMMITTEE AR
RANGES THE DEAL.
The Southern Pacific Is Notified
to Erect Shops in This City as
per Its Agree
ment.
The architects who presented plans to
the Supervisors for a new City and
County Hospital are to be partially com
pensated if the recommendation of tne
special committ-ee of the board is adopted.
Yesterday this committee, consisting of
Lackmann, Dodge and Sheehan, met and
heard a delegation of the architects upon
the subject of compensation. It was
stated by the architects that in cases
where plans are called for and buildings
are not erected, the rule is to compensate
the architects at the rate of 2Vfc per cent
of the estimated cost of the structure.
In this particular instance the cost was to
have been $300,000, therefore the archi
tects' percentage would be $7500.
The committee of Supervisors finally
stated that they would recommend the
payment to the twenty architects for
equal division the sum of $9750, which in
cluded the 2' 2 per cent mentioned and the
aggregate amount of three '"emiums
which were to have been awarded to the
second, third and fourth best set of
plans.
The architects dirt not state that they
would accept this basis of compensation,
but gave out the impression that they
would conclude to accept.
The Street Committee of the Supervi
sors met at the same time and directed
â  the Cferk of the board to notify the
! Southern Pacific Railroad to proceed
I with the erection of shops in San Fran
cisco in accordance with an agreement
made at the time when the city ceded
ci v-;tin water front street rights to the
company. Â»* v , _ . _ _
The omnilttee also received from h . T .
Imhring a deed for certain property in
the Miranda grant out near the Presidio,
the consideration paid therefor being ,
117,500. The City was obliÃed to acquire
this property in order to carry out a com- |
pact with the I'nitert States Government
to extend certain streets to the Presidio |
reservation.
Chief Clerk Russell of the Supervisors,
who had been absent in Europe for four
months, returned to his place in the office
yesterday and was closeted fnr some
hours with the Street Committee, giving,
the latter some pointers on how to con- I
duct financial affairs during the dosing
months of the year bo as to make ends
meet. Russell is considered to be the best
posted man about the city building
where municipal affairs are concerned
and upon his statements made to the i
Finance Committee tin's wpek will de
pend the final apportionment of the sur
plus funds of the city provided for by the
recent tux levy. _____

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 23.â There was a dispo
sition manifest to curtail operations on the
Ptock Exchange in the early hours of to-day's
â easii n on account of to-morrow'B holiday, for
one thing and on account of one or two de
pressing influences in the market, which of
fered obstacles to the successful prosecution of
the bull campaign. The snowstorm in the
A\>Ft, with its obstruction to traffic and re
ports of damace to livestock, was a discour
agement to advancing prices. The market felt
also that the Northern Pacific-Oregon Naviga-
Imbrogllo was to be patched up. and
Northern Pacific stocks and others concerned
downward. Weakness in a number of
the specialties, notably Tobacco, on reports of
the character of the opposition in the cigarette
branch, accentuated the prevailing tendency.
a Gas dropped off at une time 14 and]
1 r-.-.o] continued to drop. There was a.
marked falling off in the Atchlson preferred,
probably by reason of the depressing lnflu
1 ks. There was a bullish
Bplrlt latent In the market an.J It turned from ,
these centers of depression and from the re- j
glon of the snowstorm to other specialties and !
the Eastern railroads. The movement was ;
narked in the coalers and had its lncep- |
tlon in the Reading issues.
There was larpe activity at several points '
In the bond market, notably In the Reading '
1 over ami Gulf firsts and the
Colorado Southern fours "when asked." The
Ftr>n>;th of those tended to counteract weak
ness at other points. Total sales. $5,160,000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, ' Nov. 23.â Considering the light
receipts here and in the Northwest wheat had
an easier start than might have been expected.
December opened unchanged at 6S@6S%c, and
May %c lower at 67@67%c. Covering by shorts
and buying to increase long lines started, and
though not at all heavy, the demand was larger
than the offerings and an advance took place
in both options, December selling to 6S%c and
May to 67%@67%c.
The advance brought out considerable long
wheat. There was also increased liquidation,
as the lateness of the New York market and
reports regarding the export demand were con
flicting. For some time after the market was
a narrow one. with frequent moderate changes.
At about 12:30 o'clock the market firmed up
again. Seaboard receipts claim moderate
acceptances of cabled offers proved correct.
Sales here for export amounted to 180,000 bush
els.
The near report of the close or navigation
appeared to.be in the minds of general buy- j
ers. Liverpool quotations came at the close
showing a small advance. Late In the session
the weekkneed holders were not willing to re
main long over the holidays. There not being
any special demand, prices were forced off
rather easily and closing prices were about the
lowest of the day. December closed %c to %c
lower and May Is from %c to %c lower.
In a general way corn followed wheat, al
though there were Independent features influ
encing the market. May closed %C'^Â»c lower.
Oats were weak and lower, 1 May closing %
@%c lower.
At the close January pork was 7%c lower.
January lard 5c lower and January ribs 2%@ j

The custom of wearing: orange blossom
in the hair originated in Spain and not in

or bonnets of any kind, preferring to
adorn their heads with a covering of
flowers instead.

PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES
INCORPORATION OF THE TOWN
TO BE ACCOMPLISHED.

BY SAM W. WALL.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
DAWSON, Oct. 20 (via Seattle, Nov. j
23.â The work of rebuilding Dawson \
began with the extinction of the lire
tober 14. A citizens' fire patrol
was also established, not suggested j
merely by the spirit of incendiarism ,
made apparent, but by the threat that
' irked in the uncertain stovepipes of i
every house in town. The pa- I
trol was formed' by the commander of j
mounted police with pistols and :
carbines, and it has been on duty ever ;
A great number of defective I
have been reconstructed under its
rs, and rules for the safer running i
i t pipes and the setting of fireplaces j
have been printed, posted and ordered
complied with. The long-talked-of fire
department is now in course of organ- j
ization, and the equally long-talked-of
incorporation of the town has been
given an impetus that will no doubt j
land the consummation speedily, for in
ratlon seems essential to a prop
er organization of the fire department.
An ordinance, adopted at a public
meeting of citizens, has been laid be
fore Commissioner Ogilvie and awaits
his approval. It provides that to fill the
office of Mayor or of the board of j
twelve Aldermen the candidate must
be a British subject. These officers are j
chosen by the people, the franchise be
ing given at the first election to all
citizens of whatever nationality who
have resided in Dawson thirty days
Ling election and who have reach- i
> age of 21 years. At subsequent
us the same conditions remain,
but a property qualification of $200 or .
an income of $400 is added. A proposi- .
0 allow women to vote was voted j
The limits of the city are made j
race Klondike City, on the south I
t the Klondike River, and the
hill back of the flats, and these are to j
tute four wards. "With the near
ct of incorporation politicians j
already gone to whispering ami !
â : -holing up and down the streets
to sitting with the idle crouds ;
HLMiut the stoves of all the saloons, j
fur the offices are cropping
ry hand.
The weather continues open, to the |
: the oldest timer. There has j
coid weather, the mercury j
low zero, but it was for but
:. s. Ice has been running In
the river for ten days, but to-day it j
far cleared that the little steam- j
-.lay starts once more with a;
1 pass nsers and the mail pouches j
anett The Klondike and other ,
small streams are frozen, to be sure,
and this, together with a mild turn to
the weather, accounts for the clearing
of the big river of floating ice. This, i
however, must certainly be the chance j
to "get out" before the river closes and
only the lung trail over the ice and j
snow will offer itself for six months.
The price for this last trip of the j
steamer has been raised from $120 to i
$2 with meals on board at $- each \
In addition. Neither is any guarantee j
given that the passenger will be car
ried to Bennett, but only so far as the
steamer may be able or permitted by j
existing conditions to go.
Very extensive preparations are being :
made for working the placers this win
ter. Great quantities of wood are al
ready piled up along the creeks for :
burning the holes on the ground; cab
ins have been constructed until the dis- |
tance between Dawson and Lower Do
minion and Sulphur creeks, nearly
forty miles, is almost like a continu
ation of the streets of the city. An j
army of men are moving early and late, J
back and forth, over the trails leading i
to the several creeks and hay&
been doing so for weeks, al
though the real transportation of I
goods and provisions for the
winter's work does not begin until the
ice on the river is solid and the trail ;
may be laid there. It still, for the most
part, follows along the hillside as in
rammer, although the crossing of the
river is made on the ice. The general
prediction is for a very large output or
K r '!d next year. In town the number
of cabins has increased very rapidly j
during the past month, but still a great !
number of people are living in tents.
The situation as to food is peculiar.
There ar p a dozen largo dealers, all of j
thf-m .with well- stocked warehouses,!
whereas at this time last year there
wre but two dealers, and neither had
much in his wan-house. There ia
undoubtedly plenty of all the necessi

many luxuries. And yet it is next* to
impossible to buy a pound of butter or
of sugar or a can of milk. The man
agers of the big stores confess broadly
that they have these things in abun
dance and for sale, but will part with
them only to persons who will buy a
full outfit. Butter, sugar and milk have
been "cornered" in this way, not by one
Individual or one company, but by them
all, the small dealers having been
bought out or left to sell out until only
the big dealers have any of these things
on hand, and they have all taken the
same course with regard to them. But
ter when on sale in the open market
costs $2 50 a pound, sugar 35 cents and
milk 75 cents' a can. Notwithstanding
the great scarcity and high price last
year, which might have been expected
to flood the market this year, glass ha 3
been a very scarce article until within
the past ten days, when a scowload
arrived. Brooms sell at $1 50 each, a
common door lock at $3. These are all
! articles that were scarce and hign
priced last year. Flour is plentiful at
$S per sack. Immediately prior to the
starvation scare of last fall, which fol
lowed at once upon the report that the
expected steamer could not get up the
river, the price of flour was but 56 a
sack. Fresh meat, beef especially, la
on sale in abundance at 75 cents to
$1 50 a pound. Firewood costs ?o0 per
cord.
The Government has granted conces
sions to individuals in the matter of
timber until t:.e miner and citizen of
Dawson alike are almost entirely at
their mercy. Frank Slavin, the prize
fighter, has the exclusive right, for in
stance to cut the timber for five mnes
up the Klondike River, beginning at its
mouth. Any ofier man cutting in these
preserves must pay tribute to Mr. bla
vin. He is granting all comers that
I risht at the rate of $5 a cord paid to
! him. This is only one of the thousand
irritating handicaps and hardships that
are laid upon the miner and prospector,
! the one individual upon which the
1 country depends for its development
1 and wealth. The fostofflce nuisance
! Commissioner Ogilvie promises to abate
las speedily as may be. The Postoffice
! building by the ay, was destroyed in
i the fire and only some very hard work
by a good mai y hands saved the mail
! and fixtures. New quarters are being
| rapidly fitted up with a seemingly in
' telligent arrangement of boxes for the
speedy distribution of the mail.
A petition has been forwarded to Ot
! tawa asking that the new Yukon ter
ritory be allowed a representative
there. Commissioner Ogilvie and his
counsel have provided for the recog
nition of American and other foreign
physicians. The applicants will be ex
amined by a regularly constituted
board of physicians, and, passing the
examination, wia be allowed to register
and subsequently practice.

STAGE COACH WRECKED,
THE DRIVER MISSING
Mysterious Disaster Overtakes a
Young Mexican on the Desert
Near Dale City.
SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 23.â " W. E.
Vanslyke and Fred Cox, reputable mining
men, arrived from Dale City this morn
ing- with a story of the mysterious wreck
ing of the Dale City stage. It left Dale
City on time last Thursday morning at 7
o'clock with the mail and about $800 in
bullion. The Mexican driver, young
Miguel Corona, offered a free ride to
Palm Springs to any one who would ac
company him, as he was afraid to go
alone with so much bullion. There was
no one to go, so he started alone.
The stage was due to arrive at Palm
Springs at about noon on Friday. "When
it failed to put in an appearance Ora
â¢â¢, the manager, became worried on
Friday morning and hitched up a team
and started for Dale City. At Warrens
Wells, twenty-seven miles away, he
found the four stage horses. No vestige
of the harness remained on them. He
pushed on toward Dale City, forty-three
miles further. Finally, at a place
called Dog Wash, he came upon the stage.
It appeared in perfect order, except that
the tongue was broken. He was startled,
however, to find half a pailful of bloody
water standing beside the stage, as
though some one had washed his bloody
hands in it. On the top of the stage and
on the seat and right wheel were clots of
Pierce thought he saw evidences of a
struggle; in fact, he found one of the
Mexican- a shoes near the stage, but the
driver was nowhere to be seen. It was
a case of robbery and murder to all ap
pearances, but Pierce was filled with won
derment to find the mall and treasure in
- It had lain under the driver's seat
almost forty-three hours unmolested. He
took the valuables into his own rig and
drove the remaining eight miles to Dale
On the way he met Postmaster
Goodwin Dale and J. J. Arbois coming
out to look for the stage. They had
heard of the wreck from a passing team
ster. The mail and bullion was taken on
to Whitewater and reached this city to
day. No trace of the driver has been
found. Five days have elapsed since the
accident, and the man is probably dead
upon the desert. The general belief is
that there was a runaway and he was
thrown out and seriously hurt. After
binding his wounds he must have lost his
mind and wandered out over the sandy
waste.
AN ATTEMPT UPON
CZAR NICHOLAS' LIFE
Heroic Effort of a Switchman Pre
vents a Disaster on a Ball
road Bridge.
BKRLIN, Nov. 23.â A dispatch from
Elbing, the sea port of West Prussia, says
that an attempt was made upon the life
of the Czar while his Majesty was re
turning from Copenhagen.
Just before the Czar's special train
d the bridge between Bohemenfer
and Lagern a switchman discovered that
the bridge had been barricaded. By an j
almost superhuman effort, as a result of
which he Is now in the hospital, the
switchman, it appeared, succeeded in re- J
moving the obstacles sufficiently to per
mit of the passage of the imperial train.

The Chief of the Bureau of Naviga
tion of the Navy Department
Tells of the Splendid Work
of American Gunners.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â Far out of
the lines of the ordinary annual report
of the bureau officers is that of Captain
Crownlnahield, chief of the Bureau of
Navigation, Navy Department, just
made public. Not only was he a mem
ber of the war or strategy board but he
was responsible for the execution of the
plans formed by that board and for the
movement of every ship and the as
signment of every crew. Consequently
no bureau officer had equal opportunity
to know the history of the war. The
report is absolutely free from personal
ities, being confined to the statement of
hard facts, with a few important rec
ommendations for the betterment of
the naval service.
The war history begins with the sim
ple statement of certain precautionary
orders that were issued, but even In
the absence of comment attention can
not fail to be attracted to the remark
able foresight exhibited. To begin
with, an order dated ' Jaunary 11 last
directed the commander of the Euro
pean station to retain in service men
whose enlistments were about to ex
pire and those following providing for
the successful operation of the Euro
pean squadron from the dangers
which surrounded it; shows how the
South Atlantic squadron was brought
; up to reinforce Sampson; how the Ore
j gon started on her famous race around
i South America; how stores and ammu
! nition were forwarded to the squad
rons, and finally they wind up with the
famous laconic order to Dewey of
April 24:
"War has commenced between the
United States and Spain. Proceed at
once to the Philippine Islands. Com
mence operations at one particularly
! against Spanish fleet. You must cap
j ture vessels or destroy. Use utmost
endeavors."
Four months before Cervera's fleet
reached this side our whole Nc.th At
lantic fleet was ready fcr any emer-
I gency within striking distance of one
of the two points from which attack
might come. Trained gunners to the
number of forty-five, who had just
graduated from the ->urse on the Am
phitrite, were placed on the vessels of
the fleet and rendered a good account
of themselves. As exhibiting the qual
ity of these men. Captain Crownin
shield cites the destruction of three
gunboats by the little Scorpion in Man
zanillo harbor July 18, of which the
commanding officer reports: "The or
ders were given to obtain the range
with two of the six-pounders, after
which the first shell from the five-inch
guns blew her up, apparently having
struck her boilers."
Captain Crowninshield says:
The completeness of our naval victory
during the war and the almost absolute
Immunity from injury which our ships
and crews enjoyed naturally led to a gen
eral conclusion that our gunnery had
much to do with the matter. A3 a mat
ter of fact all reports bear out this con
clusion. The percentage of hitsâ smaller,
it is said, than has been obtained at tar
pet practiceâ was modified by three con
ditions. In the first place the demolition
of the enemy's ships was so complete that
it is certain that the marks of shells
were obliterated by subsequent explo
sion; in the second place the ranges at
which the combats have taken place have
been so much greater than those used In
target practice that' this difference will
account for a reduction of from 30 to 60
per cent in the percentage of hits; and,
finally, the rate of fire was much higher
in the battles than at target practice.
The bureau had been endeavoring before
the war to increase the rate of target fire
and when all this is considered it will be
found that the hits per gun per minute
have been remarkably high. In fact it
appears that the experience of each com
bat was that our marksmanship fact it
jars that the experience of each com
was that our marksmanship was so
far superior that at a range at which the
Spanish guns and gunners were ineffect
ive our guns and runners were found so
effective that before the range was or
could be reduced the Spanish ships were
either seriously crippled or their .crews
demoralized.
Captain Crowninshield declares that
the experience of the war has been one
of the greatest importance to the that
erience of the war has been one
greatest importance to the na
tion. The one defect of the war was
found in the carrying of troops and the
handling of supplies of campaign.
The Navigation Bureau recommends
that Congress must increase the naval
force to 20,000 men for general service
and 2000 apprentices, and more arma
ment is necessary.
The report recommends the passage
"he report recommends the passage
of House Bill No. 10,431, which also car
ries with it an increase of ninety-nine
in the number of line and engineer of
ficers and 100 machinists, all very much
needed.
The report does not enlarge upon the
necessities of service engineer of
â rs and 100 machinists, all very much
'he report does not enlarge upon the
â¢esslties of the service in regard to
the personnel, Captain. Crowninshield
believing that the department and
Congress are both so well acauainted
with the requirements of this detail of
naval organization, that the statement
of the bureaus will be all that it needed
to secure the action of Congress. /
A tribute is paid to the general work
of the naval militia, in manning: the
coast defense ships and the vessels of
the auxiliary naval force and furnish-
In" material for crews for the auxiliary
vessels serving with the regular fleet.
But for crews aboard ship in actual
service, these fu'nlshed nothing more
than material and in the ordinary
course most of them would have been
enlisted as landsmen and nothine
higher. All had to be thoroughly
drilled, and even the officer?, with ex
ceptions,: were found to be unqualified
to act as instructors.- The bureau rec
ommends the passage of the Cummings
bill, which provides in substance for
appropriation? for the naval militia on
an entirely different, basis. This would
provide for the creation of a national
naval reserve 1 entirely under the control
of the department, recruiting seafar
ing classes, who would be compelled to
the department, recruiting seafar-
Happps, who would ha compello-d to
serve in war times under penalty of de
sertion. The men would be required
to report once a year and drill, for
which they would receive one month's
pay.
Another recommendation Is that the
system of rewards by promotion be
abolished arid that medals of honor be
substituted so that officers may be re
warded without detriment to â¢ others.
Finally the sueerestion of the superin
tendent of the coast signal service, that
this should be made a permanent insti
tution, is appro ved; qHsil
HYDRAULIC MINING
CAUSING SHOALS
Anti-Debris Association
Protests.
URGES CONGRESS TO ACT
MARE ISLAND CHANNEL AN IN
STANCE.
It Is Declared Warships Cannot Get
to the Naval Station Be
cause the Law Is
Violated-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 23.â At a meet
ing of the executive committee of the
State Anti-Debris Association to-day
resolutions were adopted calling the at
tention of Congress to the recent report
of Chief Endicott of the bureau of
yards and docks of the navy with ref
erence to the Mare Island channel and
other portions of the bay, and ascrib
ing the conditions therein described to
hydraulic mining carried on in the
mountains contrary to law.
In the report referred to Chief Endi
cott stated that it was absolutely es
sential to deepen the channel of Mare
Island so as to create a depth of twen
ty-eight feet at mean low water from
the navy yard to the Straits of Car-
QUinez, and, further, that there was a
shoal in San Pablo Bay, on a portion of
which, between the Straits of Carqui
nez and Golden Gate, off Point Pinole,
Point Wilson and Lone Tree Point, the
depth of water was less than thirty
feet, and was at one point only twenty
one feet, enabling a battleship to pa3s
over it only at high tide. The report
also stated that in order to obtain
thirty feet of water at low tide through
this section a shoal would have to be
removed at a cost of $300,000 and it
i was important that this shoal be re
moved in order that Mare Island Navy
Yard may be accessible to all vessels
of the navy at all stages of the tide.
The State Anti-Debris Association re
solved to-day that the report was the
! mosf cogent evidence that could be pre
i sented of the injuries done by hydraulic
mining, not only to the rivers of Cali
fornia and adjacent lands, but also to
i the bays of San Pablo and San Fran-
I Cisco. The resolutions direct the atten
! tion 'of the California Senators and
i Congressmen to the fact that previous
surveys showed years ago that the tide
waters around San Francisco Bay were
affected, and were in danger of perma
nent destruction for commercial pur
poses by reason of the filling caused
by the deposit of debris from hydraulic
1 mines, but this report shows not only
i that this filling is taking place to the
detriment of commerce, but also to the
injury of Mare Island Navy Yard so as
to prevent it fulfilling its objects f-ir
i the repair and docking of the ships of
; our navy. .^______________

NO TRUST AMONG
SHIPBUILDERS
Henry T. Scott Explains
His Washington Visit.
CONSTRUCTION OF MONITORS
ALTERATIONS THAT MADE
TROUBLE FOR CONTRACTORS.
However, an Agreement Has Been
Made Whereby the New Vessels
Will Have a Greater Coal
Capacity.
6peclal Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlg-gs House,
Washington, Nov. 23.
Henry T. Scott of the Union Iron
Works, San Francisco, denies that any
ship building trust has been organized
or is in prospect.
"The sole object of my visit to Wash
ington," said he to The Call corre
spondent to-day, "was to confer with
the Navy Department people concern
ing the new monitors authorized by
Congress, one of which is to be con
structed by our company. The original
plans were for four monitors of 2700
tons each, coal capacity of 200 tons, 12
knots, and each vessel was to have a
single turret containing two 12-inch
rifles. Five millions was appropriated
by Congress for the four vessels
5i,250,000 each. Various ship builders
submitted bids, which were opened Oc
tober 1, but later the department
changed the specifications by providing
for 4000 tons and 400 tons coaling capa
city, and two turrets Instead of one,
the two turrets to contain four 10-inch
rifles. The vessels were to have extra
thick protective decks and two feet
deeper draught, but when the ship
builders discussed the matter with the
officers of the Bureau of Construction
it appeared obvious to all that this type
of vessel could not be built for $1,250,
000. We finally reached an agreement
and the construction of the vessels will
proceed without awaiting for additional
appropriations from Congress."
Although Mr. Scott could not with
propriety divulge the agreement ar
rived at, The Call correspondent ascer
tained at the Navy Department that
these four new monitors, the Wyoming,
Florida, Connecticut and Arkansas,
will be built for the most part accord
ing to the original designs, one turret
i and two guns each, though the ton
nage will be increased to 3500 tons, the
coal carrying capacity to be increased
from 200 to 500 tons and in addition
thirty feet in length of vessel.
The ship builders argued that single
turret vessels armed with two 12-inch
guns were superior to any war vessels
except the battleships, while presenting
I a smaller target to the enemy. The
added coal capacity would also enable
the monitors to make long cruises
without replenishing the supply. The
builders convinced the Naval Board
also that this type of vessel could nav
igate shallow waters inaccessible to
battleships.
Mr. Scott left for home to-night.

time he had been contemplating a call
for a meeting, when Alvin J. Bruner,
chairman of the Republican County
Central Committee, got in ahead of
him and circulated letters for the meet
ing which was held last night at the
Golden Eagle Hotel. He satd he was
not informed of last night's meeting
until the last moment, and that his offi
cial position had been so far ignored
as to put him in the attitude of a rank
outsider.
Public opinion seemed to be in large
part with the Mayor, for when he called
his meeting to order in the Council
chamber to-night the place was packed
with Republicans and no end of en
thusiasm prevailed. There was an ex
pression of sentiment in certain qua^
ters that the committee named by S.
T. Devlin should be given the complete
overlook, but such old-time Republi
cans as Frank D. Ryan and Charles T.
Jones counseled conciliatory measures,
and their advice prevailed. Mayor
Land was authorized to appoint a com
mittee, the suggestion being made that
he include residents of San Francisco,
Oakland, Los Angeles and other places
and not confine his choice to residents
of Sacramento.
The meeting adjourned until Tuesday
night, when the names will be submit
ted to the assemblage for approval.
Meanwhile nobody appears to know
which faction is going to give Gov
ernor-elect Gage his inaugural ball, al
though the suggestion has been made
that two be held, one in the Assembly
chamber and the other in the Senate
chamber, between which the Governor
elect may distribute his attendance.

WOULD LIKE TO
HOLD ANOTHER
BOND ELECTION
Park Committee Is
Again at Work.
ADAMS POINT FAVORED
MEETING CALLED FOR NEXT
WEDNESDAY.
Private Citizens Would Provide
Funds for Another Election
Should the Council
Order It.
Oakland Office Pnn Francisco Call,
90s Broadway , Not. 2::.
The Citizens' Park Committee is n<
isfled with the result of the bond election
recently held, and its members believe
that if the question were resubmitted at
an early date the necessary two-thirds
vote can be- obtained.
The committee has called a meeting for
next Wednesday at the Hoard of Trade
rooms for the purposi of considering the
matter. The committee consists ot 110
members, and they are almost a unit In
asserting that if another election be
called Adams Point would be purchased
and the other Improvements provided for
in the general scheme be carried out.
This scheme calls tor a bond i^ue of
. ot which $240,000 is for Adams
$50,000 for improving it and th'>
balance for improving West Oakland
Park and independence square.
Conferences are to be held in the part*
of town where tho necessary rwo-tmrda
was noi ol r the purpose "f
finding out if there is sufficient change of
sentiment to warrant attempting the
scheme again. It would I" 1 necessay for
the council to call another election, which
would be a very expensive proposition
This matter, however, is partly obviated
by the promises of interested citizen- to
help defray the expj nses of the election
if it be called. W. J. Dingee has already
notified the committee thut he will con
tribr. this purpose.
Principal McOhesney of the High
School, a constant advocate of parks,
â¢ s that the workingmen who casl
their votes against bonds would require a
â¢ argument to change their minds.
Although T'r.vorincr a park, he do
vocate putting the matter I c peo
ple again In a spirit of overconfidence.
A suggestion made that the
over i" the general election
â¢â \ spring, when the matter could be
Bubmitted and a more general expression
of sentiment could be obtained than at a
special election.
Mayor Thomas believes that West Oak
land might be induced to favor the bonds
if a little additional sop were thrown at
them, and he suggests that $50,000 ii 111 11 ss t o ; <. . l
of $20,000 !><â¢ included for the park at that
end of t' â  v\ â ..
X. Xt Friday evening a meeting of the
Council committee appointed to report on
the proposed sale of the City ilall site
will be held, and as th*-so two schemes
are closely related members of the park
committee will attend the council of the

HE RAN FOR OFFICE
WITHOUT KNOWING IT
WHY J. W. PHILLIPS FAILED TO
SPEND A CENT.
His Candidacy for Assemblyman ]
Dawned on Him When He
Read the Returns.
Oakland Office San Francisco Tall,
908 Broadway, Nov. 23.
JuÂ«t now the bills of election expendit
ures of successful as well as unsu
ful candidates at the recent election are
piling up in the pigeonholes of County
Clerk Jordan's documentary desk, and
rare bits of humor are found in some of
the? -. Perhaps the one liled by J. W.
Phillip?, the Prohibition candidate for As
semblyman from the Forty-ninth District,
is at once the trui-st. most correct, brief
est, most s. rlous and yet most humorous
of the lot. It reads simply:
"My name w;is placed on the official bal
lot without my knowledge' or consent;
therefore there was no committee ap
pointed nor any money expended either by
myself or by any one else in my behalf
to* my knowledge."
In expressing his surprise over his can
didacy Mr. Phillips said, as he filed his
statement: "I had no intimation of it at all
until I read the returns of the election in
the papers and found that 1 had received j
votes for Assemblyman. To say I was !
surprised is a mild way to put it, and not ]
having any knowledge of the same I made
no effort and jÂ»pent not one cent."

PLANNED QUICK DIVORCE.
Mrs. Taylor Served Summons on Her
Husband and Then Married
J. H. .Eckley.
OAKLAND, Nov. 23.â There is a bit of
romance connected with the Eekley-Tay
lor matrimonial affair that has so recent
ly been exploited in the local courts.
It appears that since the time of Eck
ley s legal release from his former wife,
Mrs. Frankie J. Taylor has secured a di
vorce from her husband as well, and she
was receiving Eckley at her home at the
Bame time. She was so exceedingly anx
ious to secure a decree that she served
the summons upon him personally, as he
was boarding a steamer for Honolulu. Her
husband had important business on the
islands and she knew that he would have
to lose his case on default or lose consid
erable time and money if he stayed and
fought it.
As has already been published Judge
Hall yesterday held Eckley in contempt
of court in not having paid his ex-wife
alimony and an order for his arrest lias
been J;-\sue<i Uit he is still in Reno, Nev
wit-b v^f newly acquired bride.
FORGOT HIS MARRIAGE.
Lowell J. Hardy Is Declared Incom- i
petent by the Court.
OAKLAND, Nov. 23.â Judge Ellsworth
to-day appointed Attorney Lowell J.
Hardy Jr. as guardian of the person and
estate of his father, Lowell J. Hardy, the
capitalist, and his bond was fixed at
$33,000. s ' ::. r
According to the peittion of the son, the
elder Hardy, aged over 82 years, is in
competent mentally and physically by
reason of his age, sickness and weakness
of mind to properly manage or take care
of himself or his vast estate or enter into
any contracts. Of late the senior Hardy,
though, twice a widower, showed strong
symptoms of a desire to wed for the
third time a young bride, and in order to
bring; about- such a union he was about
to deed away a considerable portion of his
property, when, in the nick of time, the
son interfered, and now that he is, under
the guardianship of the son. all matri
monial anticipations have been nipped in
the bud.
At the hearing to-day Dr. J. S. Adams
testified that the aged Hardy had evi
dently forgotten entirely that he was ever
married to a second wife, who died last
April. Captain A. S. Grant also test tied
to Hardy's eccentricities and Pf
and Judge Ellsworth forthwith dwjared
the aged man incompetent and granted
t heron's petition.

Significant Change in the Realty

OAKLAND. Nov. 23.â Ira Bishop gen
eral superintendent of the Realty Syndi
cate's system of street railroads, has re
stened This act on his part was a great
surprise to the city officials and the hun
dreds of employes of the syndicate, as
Superintendent Bishop has just Inaugu

of franchises and transfers, which will
Xa .?, l HMÂ» t r?!rs.!n ?Â£' Mr! Bishop's sud
den resignation is not known and he de
clines to discuss the subject In a definite
way It is said, however, that all is not
harmonious in the board of directors and
that the public Is not altogether pleased
with the manner in which matters have
been conducted since the many smaller
systems were consolidated In the powerful
corporation. â ... . ,
' Mr Bishop admitted that he had handed
in his resignation, but denied there was
any friction in the board. V- : V "
He was appointed to control the vast
system of street railroads In Oakland,
Alameda. Berkeley and Fruitvale when
the Syndicate absorbed the Piedmont line.
For some years Mr. Bishop had been at
the head of that line and owned a consid
erable interest in it. On assuming charge
of the Syndicate's many lines he found
many routes paralleled and power houses
scattered all over the city. He at once
commenced a policy of strict economy.
It is believed there is friction in the
board of directors.
FEARS HER SON
WEDDED FOR CASH
FLOftENT HOFFER LEFT PRESI
DIO TO GET MARRIED.
Was Court-Martialed, and Now the
Bride Seeks Her Mother-in-Law
for Support.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 23.
If the surmises of George Hart go for
anything, Florent Hoffor. a private at the
Presidio, who applied for a marriage li
cense at County Clerk Jordan's office a
few days ago. has taken a bride to secure
cash.
According to Hart, who called at the
County Clerk's office to-day, Hoffer well
knew that he was breaking the military
law but this did not interfere with his
conscience in view of the prize he had set
his heart uponâ in the person ot Miss
Clara Duncliff.
"When Hoffer returned to camp after his
marriage he was court-martialed and was
thrown into prison, while his bride, who is
without subsistence, called on the mother
in-law in the hope of receiving a blessing
and being taken under quasi-parental
w i ii g.
Mrs. Hoffor. the aged mother-in-law, is
quite well-to-do, and enjoys a fair month
ly income from her property in S.in Fran
cisco. Some time ago. and prior to her
enlistment, she pave him Beveral
hundred dollars to invest in a mine up the
country. tht " son having brought home
some specimens that looked promising.
According t'> the young man's story the
mine â¢'diiin't pan out," and he was bun
koecL
Now, according to the statement of
Hart, who is Hofrer's cousin, the lattcr's
mother fears that her soldier boy has
married the Duncliff young lÂ»dy to throw
her upon the mother's good graces for sup
port, in order to secure more money from
her. as he has done heretofore.
Hart wished to ascertain from the Coun
ty <"lÂ»rk whether the issuance of the mar
riage license had been free from flaws,
and was assured that under present ex
isting conditions no way could be found
whereby the couple's scheme could be
thwarted.
They Agreed to Separate..
OAKLAND. Nov. 23.â Several years ago
Mary E. Slater and William W. Slater

THE SAX FRAKCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1893.
INTEREST HAS
NOW CENTERED
IN THE LEAGUE
Municipal Politics to
Be Very Lively.
GILES H. GRAY FOR MAYOR
JOHN L. DAVIE MIGHT ALSO BE
A CANDIDATE.
The Municipal League May Decide to
Enter the Campaignâ The Ques
tion Now Being Con
sidered.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 23.
Interest in city politics centers largely
in the Municipal League. Six years ago
the Municipal League won at the polls.
Four years ngo it partly won, and two
year? ago it cut no figure at all. Its ex
ecutive committee has almost decided to
take an active part in this campaign.
This means that Giles H. Gray will prob
ably receive the league's nomination for
Mayor, and his name has already been
put forward.
Should the league again enter politics
actively it is more than likely that the
tactics of four years ago will be repeated
and that John L. Davie will receive the
support of all the other parties. In 1894
the league and the regular parties had
an interesting fight. J. \V. Nelson, the
league candidate, was indorsed by every
body but the Topulists. The latter put
up Davie and Nelson"? indorsements were
all that hr got outside the league, for
the votes went to Davie.
Conditions are much the same as
they were when Davie was elected, and it
is reasonable to suppose that the same
tactics would be employed in the city
campaign. Ex-Mayor Davie has a strong
campaign argument, which increases each
year in strength. It is the recital of the
fact that he fought the Southern Pacific
to reduce ferry fares materially and thus
saved the people of Oakland tens of thou
sands annually. As Davie is understood
to be back again in the Republican ranks
he will be a formidable- candidate against
any one who may be nominated.
Already there are nigjis that the fami
ly relations at th<> City Hall may be dis
turbed next spring. Treasurer (lilpin haa
succeeded hiinnelf for many terms, but
now there is an opposition to him devel
oping in certain quarters. At the last
meeting of the Council Gilpln was cen-
Bured by several <>f the members for not
being able to pay the warrants of the
city's employes, .although there is a
large amount of money in the city treas
ury. These warrants have to be discount
ed* at banks and Councilmen Girard and
Earl stated that such a condition reflects
no credit on the city or the Tax Collector.
Mr. Gilpin has explained that there must
be certain apportionment of funds and
certain methods followed In allotting the
city's money that make it impossible for
him to expedite payment on filed war
rants. The incident, however, possesses
its chief significance from the fact that
it is an evidence of opposition to his re
election.
LILLIAN BRANDES
LAID TO REST
SIMPLE SERVICES HELD AT
BERKELEY.
In Separate Cells in the Oakland
Prison Her Parents Maintain
Moody, Sullen Silence.
BERKELEY, Nov. 23.â Lillian Brandos
was buried in Mountain View Cemetery
this afternoon.
Simple services were held at the small
Morgue in the university town where the
girl's body has been kept since the day
of the tragedy. A large number of peo
ple attracted by the sympathy every
where felt on her behalf gathered around
the white casket. The last words were i
spoken. The casket was the gift of the |
people of Berkeley, purchased by funds
obtained by public subscription. The con
gregation sang "Jesus, Lover of My
Soul," after which the Rev. J. M. Pierce
read selections from the scriptures. A
prayer was offered by Rev. John Coyle, !
and" the Rev. J. M. Pierce followed with
a. short address. No reference was made
to the distressing circumstances respon
sible for the young girl's untimely end.
The service closed with a hymn sung by
Mrs. Coyle and Mrs. Pierce.
Henry C. Barrows, foreman of the Coro
ner's jury, Thomas Harm. C. H. Town
â¢â¢â 11(1 and Richard Lloyd served as pall
bearers. The last rites were held at the
grave.
\\ . A. Brandes and his wife spent some
hours to-day talking to their attorneys,
J. E. Bennett and Judge Sawyer. Brandes i
is continually complaining that there Is
no foundation for the tales of cruelty that
are being circulated. He is very moody
and declines to discuss the details of his
alleged crime on the ground that his at
torneys had advised him not to talk.
Mrs. Brandfs was not told of the ver
dict of the jury until thtÂ« morning, and
when she learned she was charged as be
ing accessory to the crime of murder she
expressed great surprise. She has not
been permitted to see her hsuband since
he was taken to jail. They frequently ask
to see each other and say they would like
to arrange some business matters. As
Brandes has not a dollar in the world the
plea on behalf of business interests does
not have any effect on the Sheriff.
To-day Brandes said he would like to
employ Attorney Deupny to defend him,
but as he has already sold his watch to
raise a little money, it is evident he is en
tirely out of funds. He is very much de
jected and solaces himself by telling
about the legal talent he will employ to
clear him of the charge of murder.
Union Services in Alameda.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 23.â The churches of

Golden West Stake a

GAUNTLET IS A REALGOODONE
REDDINGTON WAd UNPLACED
IN THE HTJRDI E EVENT.
A Long Price Was Laid Against Ben
amela â Pongo Downed a "Bad
Lot â Four of the Favor
ites Won Purses.
The Golden "West stake, over a mile and
a half, valued at $1000, the classic feature
of Ingleslde's racing card yesterday,
might just as well have been decided In
Sleepy Hollow or some other sea port
town for all the interest It evoked. The
entries were ground down to two, Buck
wa and Marplot. There was little to
choose between them in the betting, the
general quotations being 9 to 10 and take
your pick. The suspicious underpinning
of Marplot apparently troubled him, and
Ed Purser's aged gelding won all the way
In hollow fashion.
The card throughout had a gaunt, care
worn look and things in the betting ring
wore as calm and peaceful as at a camp
meeting. Perhaps the thought of those
who may have perished in the great fire
caused this depressed feeling. When a
favorite won â and four of them did earn
bracketsâ it aroused no sign of enthusi-
asm.
Burns tk "Waterhouse started Gauntlet
for the first time in the opening sprint,
fnr two-year-olds, and backed down to 4
to 5 favoritism the son of imp. Cavalier
never left the result In doubt. Shaking off
Lob Medanos in the stretch, he won with
pounds to spare. In a hard drive "Skeets"
Martin, on Rainer, took the show from
Limewater.
When Pongo closed in the betting an
even money chance over a bunch of
maidens it Is needless to remark they
were a cheap lot. The chestnut horse
was nearly left at the post In the second
event and then passed the judges at
leisure two lengths In front of Sokombeo.
Durward was third.
The mile selling run was the one event
of the day that caused any reaA specula
tion. Nearly every starter was*aocorded
support. Away poorly, the two-year-old
JfiiKlo Jinglo ran around her field, lead
ing to the stretch, where she gave it up.
Rutter, on Benamela, then took the lead
and at the end won handily from Bonnie
lone. â¢ __,
ESd Corrigan's jumper Rpndington was
sent to the post a 4 to 5 chance, but had
mine of his old time speed and was un
placed. Viking, the second choice, with
Mattier up, held his field safe, leading
Granger out by two lengths. The wretch
edly ridden P F was third
In the final five and a half furlong spin
Formella had her speed and won all the
way. Fleming, a 9 to 1 shot, took the
place from Aluminum.
Track Notes.
The finish for the show between Rainier
and Llmewater was very eloso, and many
thought the latter should have had the
verdict.
Rabieca of the Duke & Wlshard string
was suffering from an Incurable disease
of the hoof, and on Tuesday was de
stroyed.
On account of the death of his sheet
writer, Nate Pryor, who perished In the
Baldwin Hotel fire. "Virginia" Carroll did
nol book yesterday.
\V. B. Sink Jr. reports a loss of nearly
$3000 in Government greenbacks.
The fire helped Barney Schreiber in one
respect. In his room were $30,000 worth of
markers, and it saved him the trouble of
burning them.

AMERICAN FRUIT
WAS CONDEMNED
MALICIOUSLY
Inspectors Said it Was
Infected.
THE SAN JOSE SCALE AGAIN
SAMPLE OF THE CONSIGNMENT
BROUGHT BACK HERE.
Not a Trace of the Pest Was Found
on It jÂ».fter a Careful Exam
ination by an Expert
Entomologist.
Germany has of late been making a
gTeat outcry over California fruit, and In
consequence thousands of tons of apples, J
oranges and pears have been condemned j
because the- Kaiser's Inspectors asserted
th.y were affected with the San Jose
scale and other pests. Now It turns out
that the Germans do not know anything
about such things, or it' they do will not
take the trouble to find out whether the
fruit is infected or not, but simply con
demn it because It came from the United
States. Here is a case in point.
Some time ago a German firm ordered
from parties In this city forty carloads
of dried pears. When the consignment
reached Hamburg it was condemned by
the German authorities on the ground
that it was infected with the San Jose
Ecak-. The owners of the fruit were satis- j
fied that there was a mistake somewhere, j
and cabled for a sample to be sent back â 
at their expense.
This sample reached San Francisco a
few days ago, and the original package as
it was received through the mails was
turned over to Alexander Craw, quaran
tine officer for the State Board of Horti- !
culture. Mr. Craw went carefully over j
every piece of fruit in the sample and j
could not rind a trace of Kan Jose or any i
other scale on it. He went over the fruit ;
a second time, and failed to lind even an
Indication that there ever had been any
scale on it.
The wholesale house that handled the j
fruit here immediately cabled the result
of Mr. Craw's investigation to Hamburg, ]
With the result that the fruit was immt
diately released from quarantine and the j
linn to whom it was consigned cabled for i
a further loi of two carload's. The ex- !
cuse given by the German inspectors was
that they did not have microscopes power
ful enough to tell whether the scale was
dead or not.
"There Is positively no danger of dried
fruit carrying scale disease into any
country/ Bald Mr. (.'raw yesterday. "It
seems to me the German authorities
should have known that. As to San Jose
there i* practically none of it In
California, it is an imported pest, and
eot the name it is most generally known
by because it first made its appearance at
Ban Jose. California is wonderfully free
from all kinci.s of pests and the San Jose j
Is only found in neglected orchards
or ..ii trees in lack yards of city houses.
The dried pears that were sent to Ger- i
many and a sample of which was re- j
turned here for examination had not ai
:â¢ f any kind of pest whatever on it. I
'*< a! the subject of those pests I have !
written a letter for J. A. Filcher of the I
State Board of Trade. I have gone very !
fully into the merits of the scale question
an>! have proved, I think, that no foreign
ry need fear the introduction of;
rnia fruit. The letter, I believe, is
for circulation in Germany."

COMMEMORATION
OF THE DAY OF
THANKSGIVING
Where and How It
Will Be Celebrated.
A GLANCE AT ATTRACTIONS
TURKEY AND GOOD CHEER GA
LORE FOR THE POOR.
Services to Be Held in the Churches
of the Different Denominations
Throughout the
City.
A black pall of sorrow will be thrown i
i over the festivities to be held through- i
| out the city to-day In honor and com- |
memoration of Thanksgiving day. The
memory and heroism of those who suf
fered in the crumbling walls of the old j
Baldwin Hotel will be the sad topic Â«-.s
cussed around the festal board in hun
dreds of homes.
The attention of the public, however, |
will be diverted from the contemplation |
of the awful disaster by many of the j
amusements and events of interest which
will be given through the course of the ;
day.
The great football game at Central i
Park between Berkeley and Stanford i
will be the center of enthusiasm and at
traction. Already the city has donned
the crimson and the blue ar.'l gold and
now awaits with impatience the result of j
the exciting contest on the gridiron.
The game â¢ will begin promptly at 2
o'clock. The gates to the park, however, j
will be opened to the public at 11:30 I
o'clock in the morning to accommodate
the thousands who are in possession of |
tickets with seats before the commence
ment of the game.
The theatricals this year, which are to
be held at Odd Fellows' Hall, will be un- j
usually interesting.
Nearly a score of student actors have
been in training for some time under the â¢
coaching of George Hermance. A farce !
"The Football Commissioner From i
France." will be presented under the
management of BirneyDonnell. There will !
be specialties from some of Berkeley's j
cleverest monologists, the glee, mandolin |
and guitar clubs of the university will
render college selections, and there will i
be a big orchestra of college musicians.
The farce is a very clever adapta- ;
tion by a playwright graduate, and is
brimful of laughable situations. It tells
the story of a Berkeley professor who
takes lodgers and unexpectedly becomes
the host of the football commissioner ;
from France, who has come from the
universities of his native country to learn
the gridiron sport and introduce it to
French students. .Â»â,.--
Amusing complications arise from an
army major's pursuit of his wife, who he ,
believes has run away with the young
Frenchman; the latter, however, being
in love with Ucle. the Berkeley beauty,
daughter of the professor. Following is
the cast of characters of the farce:

olic churches. In the Protestant and
other houses of worship there will be a j
sacred observance of the day.
At St Marys Cathedral high mass will .
be celebrated promptly at 9 o'clock and a

Extensive preparations are being made
by the Mothers' Club of the Young Men's
Christian Association to entertain young j
men away from home. The guests of the
institution will gather in the parlors of |
the building at 4:30 o'clock. Dinner will be !
served at 5 o'clock, and will be presided
over by Mrs. B. C. Wright. Grace will be

able memory.
All the former pupils of the Youths' Di
rectory are invited to attend a turkey
dinner at the old home on Howard street.
They will be addressed on the occasion by
Rev. Father Crowley, who will briefly out

ance of the day. Immediately after the |
dinner the boys will write to former asso
ciates now in the Philippine Islands. Many
of those who were here last year to enjoy
the hospitality of the home are now serv

CAPTAIN HALL READY FOR
A BARD, FIERCE GAME
In speaking for my team I will
say that there is hope and confi
dence in every one of the eleven. I
know that we will have to play
a hard, fierce game to win out. We
are not overconfident and do not
underrate the ability of our oppo
nents. I know that Stanford will
place a team in the field that will
be strong and courageous. If we
should win I think the score will be
a small one. Victory Is our end and
not a stone will be left unturned
in the struggle for it. The rest has
put us In fine shape with not a sick
man on the team. This is the cul
mination of over two months' train
ing and everything has a bright
hue for the blue and gold eleven.
At any rate I think we have an
even chance.

COACH CROSS' MEN ARE
IN SPLENDID CONDITION
The season is over and the two
teams are ready to go on the field.
The trip to Congress Springs has
certainly done the boys a great
amount of good, and they are in
splendid condition. The improve
ment in the play is noticeable and
everything looks well for the
cardinal. I cannot form any esti
mate of the comparative, strength
of the two elevens, and consequent
ly cannot say which team will
prove the conqueror to-morrow.
If determination will win for us,
then the Stanford eleven will have
another victory to add to its list.
The line is ordinarily strong and
the backs are good, average men,
playing together in much better
style than a few days agn. There Is
really nothing more to say before
the battl? to-morrow, the result of
which will prove the superiority of
one of the college teams over the

prognostications announce fair weather
for the day. In isometric thermals the
prejudgment is northwesterly winds, with
sky occasionally overclouded. Translated
this means fair weather, and the enthu
siasts are happy.
The last conference of coaches and
managers took place at the Palace Hotel
last night, the object belnÂ£ to come to
some conclusion in regard to the interpre
tation of the rules. All matters were de
cided satisfactorily. Harvey is to be um
pire and Goodwin Is to be referee through
out the game.
In a few hours the two elevens that
have been in training for three months
will meet on the Recreation Park grid
iron in the final struggle of the football
season. California pronounces herself in
fine shape, and Stanford gives an echo to
her voice. All that remains now is the
signal for the clash of arms and the bat
tle of IS9B will be ushered in.
Packing their tents quietly and secretly
the Stanford team, with its retinue of
enthusiasts, sidled out of Congress
Springs yesterday morning and started for
San Francisco. They traveled by stage
to Mountain View and then boarded the
flyer, which arrived here at 4 o'clock.
The eleven is now quartered at the Pleas
anton, where it will remain until the
game to-day. As its arrival was not ex
pected until this morning the cardinal
did not receive much of a welcome upon
entering the city. This as just what the
managers desired, however, as they did
not wish any rally or peace-disturbing,
thinking it would be to the team's advan
tage to remain quiet and unseen.
The Stanford eleven looks to be in the
best of health, and in the full vigor of its
physical strength. Not a man Is injured,
with perhaps the single exception of Free
man, but his injuries are not severe
enough to prevent his playing. All the
others are anxious for the fray, and all
that troubles their equanimity is a desire
to be in the midst of things.
California's team will not leave Berke
ley until this morning. The men will come
over on the tug Reliance and go at once
to the St. Nicholas, where they will re
main until the nour of the game. No re
ception, welcome or rally will mark their
arrival at the hotel for the same reasons
that induced the Stanford directors to
conduct the team to this city under the
cover of a surprise.
There is, of course, no way of telling
just how the cat is going to jump, but In
all athletic events the betting generally
indicates the direction in which the ma
jority of people think the cat may make
up her mind to move. If the odds given
rule the predictions of the wise, or to be
more correct. If the knowing ones give
odds as a result of their predictions, then
California will certainly go on the field
to-day a favorite over Stanford. The
boys from across the bay sent $1700 over
to the city early this week. Charley New
man wa.s" commissioned to get it on. but
up to last night had only placed $300 of
the amount and that at It) to 8. with
Stanford on the short end. When the un
dergraduate body from Palo Alto arrives
this morning th<> botting may liven up un
der the excitement usually attendant on
a big game. The men from Stanford will
have no difficulty in getting their gold
covered whenever they show its color.
The public has made California the fa
vorite and the public controls the bet
ting. Coach Cochrane said last night that
it was a foolish wager for any man to
offer more than even money on any team.
ROSSER ON TRIAL
FOR HIS LIFE
FOTJB WITNESSES TELL OF HIL
DEBRAND'S MUEDER.
The Prisoner Was Smiling When He
Seized Young Walsh by the
Shoulder and Fired the
Fatal Shot.
Private Walter Rosser of the Tennessee
Volunteer Regiment, who on September
13 last murdered Henry Hildebrand in the
Spreckels Market, was placed on :rial foi
his life before Judge Wallace yesterday.
The youthful prisoner appeared in court
accompanied by his aged father and coun
sel, W. H. L. Barnes.
During the morning session of the trial
a Jury was secured to determine the fate
of the young defendant.
Four ' witnesses were examined during
the afternoon sessionâ C. W. Foster, Wil
lie Walsh, John F. Baxter and George
Bayford. All saw the shooting, but the
most interesting testimony was given by
Baxter. He saw the murderer enter the
market, pass along among the people ani
accost young Walsh. He was smiling
when he grasped Walsh by the shr.ulder,
said the witness, and was apparently
looking for anything but a human life.
He heard no conversation between "he
murderer and his victim, but saw Rosser
suddenly reach into his pocket, draw his
revolver and, still holding Walsh by the
shoulder, lean over the counter and fire
the fatal shot. He then started toward
the door in the rear of the market, but
turned and sent another bullet crashing
through the wall on the other side of the
building. He then fled, fell down the rear
steps of the market, got up again anr!
continued his flight until apprehended at
the corner of Stevenson and Third streets.
All the witnesses gave testimony to the
same effect. None were able to throw the
least light on the possible motive for the
crime. The prosecution contends there
was none; that Rosser went out to kill
THE BABY MYSTERY SOLVED
W. B. Hayward, the Father, Owing to Poverty,
Cave the Two Scavengers a Dollar
to Bury It Decently.
THE mystery of the newly born babe
that was discovered on Monday
among a heap of garbage at the
crematory has been solved and the
labors of Detective Dillon and Policeman
Bakulich are at an end. Yesterday after
noon W. B. Hayward, a waiter living at
oil Franklin street, accosted Policeman
Baxter and told him that he was the
father of the baby. Hayward was ac
companied by Dr. V. '. Knorp, 121S Mis
sion street.
Baxter took them to police head
quarters, where Hayward told his story.
He said his wife gave birth to the Âaby
last Monday morning about 1 o'clock, Dr.
Knorp attending her. The baby was
stillborn, and as he was poor and had not
enough money to pay an undertaker,
when the two scavengers came around
about noon he gave them the body and
CAPTAIN FISHER EXPECTS
STANFORD WILL WIN
The Stanford eleven is in fine fet
tle and will give a goood account
of itself in the big game. We have
improved in team play during the
last week and the team has got to
gether for united play. We will
play football that is full of deter
mination and the California eleven
will know that it has been in a
game when the Whistle blows at
the end of the second half. I think
we have a fair chance to win the
game and I know that the tea.m
will do all in Its power to effect
the desired resultâ another Stan
ford victory. It is the intention of
the Stanford eleven to play clean
football and I feel sure that Cali
fornia will do the same. When we
line up to-morrow the public will
Bee a game of ball which will be
full of spirit and determination.
That Cochrane has won the affections of
the California team is without dispute.
Never has a coach received such evidences
of the good will of students at the L ni
versity of California. Last Sunday he was
presented with a pipe handsomely deco
rated and now comes a further memento
of California's appreciation. Cochrane re
ceived a split-second watch, open face,
with gold case, from the student body last
night and he is the happiest man in four
counties. Still with all his exuberance of
feeling and kindliness toward the men
of the blue and gold, with whom he has
been associating during the past months,

COACH GARRET COCHRANE
PROUD OF HIS TEAM
Tt may appear strange, but I have
never called a football game in my
life, and I fear to venture a pre
judgment of the intercollegiate con
test to-morrow between the Uni
versity of California and Stanford.
I can say this much, however: The
California eleven is In splendid
physical condition and is capable of
playing good football. I have given
my most earnest efforts to the
building of a team, and unless
something unexpected happens I
feel satisfied that the blue and gold
athletes will give a good account
of themselves on the field. The
condition is certainly there. In order
to win the team will be forced to
play fierce, spirited football and not
slow up for a single minute. The
morrow will tell the taleâ whether
the blue and gold flag or the car
dinal will wave triumphant.
and accomplished his purpose the first
time a suitable opportunity presented it
self. The case will go on again this morn
