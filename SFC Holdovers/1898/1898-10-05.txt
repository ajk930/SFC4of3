VOLUME LXXXIV.-NO. 127.
SAMPSON TO
BE MADE THE
SCAPEGOAT
Blame for the Campaign Scandals
to Be Foisted on the
Admiral,
General Corbin Said to Have Prepared an Elab
orate Report for the Commission With
This Object in View.
SpÂ«clal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: There is a merry row
between the army and navy over the
evidence that will soon be forthcoming
before the Army Investigation Commit
tee. In this evidence, both the haste
in starting off the troops for Santiago
and the delay later is blamed directly
or indirectly upon Admiral Sampson.
The blame is not placed in the report
in direct terms, but it is so inserted in
the paper as to give it that force.
The document referred to is the an
swer of Adjutant General Corbin to the
communication addressed to him by the
Commission. General Corbin estimated
that it will be about one thousand
pages or three million words. It in
cludes the correspondence sent and re
ceived relative to the campaigns in Ma
nila, Porto Rico and Cuba in chrono
logical order. His answer was this
morning sent to the Commission.
Part of the dispatch from Admiral
Sampson at Santiago, under date of
June 7, is in these words:
"If ten thousand men were here the
city of Santiago would be ours in forty
eight hours."
â¢ This dispatch also -was sent by Ad
miral Sampson on June 7:
"Only await arrival of troops to re
duce Santiago."
Thereupon General Shafter replied on
June S:
"I will come to-morrow morning."
Then came the advice that a "spook"
Spanish fleet was in sight and the
starting of the transports was delayed
until June 14.
These two facts will be relied on by
the War Department to show that Gen
eral Shafter could not have waited
longer than he did and that the packing
together of men in the transports for I
flve days mure pending the dels."/ was
from no fault of Shafter's.
The War Department officials have j
for the first time from weariness j
stopped blaming one another, and since
the exhaustive statement of General j
Miles, after his return from Porto Rico
he has been looked upon with whole- j
some fear, if not with affection. It was .
seen that he had become too strong to j
be made a scapegoat and so Sampson
will now be experimented upon.
"It is a dangerous experiment," said
a naval officer to-day, "but it is to be
tried."
GENERAL WHEELER
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE
His Testimony Tends to Defend Shaf
ter and Make Light of
Scandals.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 4.â The War In
vestigating Commission began its ex
amination of witnesses to-day by plac
ing General Joseph Wheeler on the
stand.
Speaking of the proceedings after the
first battles in Cuba he explained that
he had been reported sick and that â 
there were some movements just prior
to the battle at El Caney with which
he was not familiar.
"I was not sick." he said, "but I had
been so on the 29th and 30th. Still, I
had not gone on the sick list. 1 had a
f-ver, but I appreciated the situation,
took medicine and came out all right."
He was in the battle of El Caney and
expressed the opinion that more men
had been killed in the formation of the
line than afterward. He told of the I
necessity for wading the San Juan
River, saying that the water was about
â waist deep.
â¢I ought to say," said the general, in
the course of his testimony, "that it was
magnificent to see officers of high rank
go ashore with their packs oij their
backs, accepting all the fortunes of war
with their men. They slept on the
ground with the soldiers. None of us
were mounted, and we were without
tents for seven days."
The supplies he considered sufficient
except in v few Instances, and In those
the deficiency was only temporary.
"General BhtÂ».fter," he said, "deserves
gTeat credit for the zeal he displayed in
this respect, lie devoted himself to this â 
task, and I think there is no doubt that
he succeeded. We used pack trains and
there was comparatively little suffering
because of the shortness of quarter
master's supplies."
Discussing the plan of campaign, he
said he doubted whether any more ef
fective could h lye been adopted. Speak
ing of the medical department, be said
at times there were complaints, but
that they were not serious. On ac
casionfl there was shortage of surgeons,
some of the medical men being sick or
â¢wounded. Aocording to General Wheel
er's belief the wounded in battle were
promptly cared for by the surgeons.
After the fteht of July 1 all the wound
ed were carried from the field that
night. The witness had heard that
there was more complaint of the short
age of medicine among the infantry
than in the cavalry service.
Going back to Tampa he said there
â was at tin >s some shortage of sup
plies at the camp, "but nothing," he
added, "that a soldier should complain
of." They had comfortable tents and
the commissary supplies were suffi
cient. The water supply also was good.
Returning to the Santiago campaign,
he said that only two regiments had re
ported a shortage of rations, and he
had Immediately telephoned to the rear
and the shortage, which was due to ac
cident, had been adjusted. There was
Buffering when the men were compelled
to lie in the breastworks. The meat
was poor and they had no bread but
hardtack. They were forced to live in
The San Francisco Call
I the sun and water alternately and
j necessarily there was much sickness.
While they had the full quota of doc
- he thought that ;r more
! had been furnished the men would
i have been better cared for. As for ra
i tions, three days' supply was generally
1. Whenever the troops went into
n they would throw their food
i away as well as their packs, and they
n did no ; recover them.
In reply to questions he stated that
j he never had heard of any shortage of
; commissary or ordinance supplies at
tgo, but he had been told that the
medical supplies were short, yet he
; had no personal knowledge on this
point. He had seen some wounded men
crawling to the rear in the engage
; ments, but, as a rule, as soon as a man
fell in battle he was carried to the hos
pital by the medical corps. He said
'â¢ that, as a rule, the quality of the hard
i tack was good. Where there was de
'â  terioration it was due to local rains
j and not to the fact of original in
| ferlority.
The spirit of the army was such, he
| said, that there was no disposition to
j complain.
"The men were all proud to be there
and willing to ndergo hardships."
Replying to a question from Colonel
Denby, Gener; - Wheeler said the regu-
I lars had shown greater ability to take
i care of themsel'-es than the volunteers.
Captain Howell asked to what he at
tributed the development of disease af
j ter the capitulation of Santiago. Gen
eral Wheeler . plied that it was due to
I the climate and to the necessary ex
! posure. All the men seemed to be more
!or less affected by the conditions. He
I had, he said, known of no instance of a
; sick or wounded man dying from want
'of care from the physicians. So far as
I he knew there wlj general commenda
i tion of the medical corps, except that
jon one or two ccasions there had been
i some grumbling in regard to the gen
! eral conditions. He thought there was
a deficiency in the number of ambu
lances, but this deficiency was dv*> to
the exigencies of the campaign.
General Wheeler also said, in reply
to Captain Howell, that he knew of no
confusion in the securing of supplies
from Tampa.
After recess General Wheeler devoted
his testimony chiefly to his experience
at Camp Wikoff, Montauk Point.
The general location and the trans
portation facilities of the camp, he said,
were poor. There was but one line of
railroad and that a single track and
without adequate terminal facilities.
The camp could have been supplied by
water, but unfortunately there was a
contract with the railroad company
owning the land which gave it the con
trol of all transportation except that
on Government transports. This con
tract had been made, he understood, in
return for the use of the land. He did
not know who had made the contract.
There were good hospitals erected,
but there was a scarcity of nurses.
General Wheeler considered the hos
pital facilities ample after the erection
of the division hospitals. There were
times when they were crowded for a
day or two. but on the other hand there
were many times when the buildings
were not filled.
Taking up the charges made by the
New York World and by Dr. Jenkins
in its columns. General Wheeler said
that if the soldiers had not been landed
at some isolated place such as Mon
tauk Point the fear of yellow fever
would have caused a general outcry.
Montauk Point, he thought in briefi
was a necessity for quarantine pur
posesâto prevent the spread of fever,
if for no other purpose.
Replying to other allegations made
by the World General Wheeler said he
did not think the hospitals were crowd
ed; that if the sick were without blank
ets or adequate shelter he had not
known the fact, and if he had known
such a want he would have supplied it
"There were," he said, "undoubtedly
individual cases of suffering and neg
lect, but they were the exception." He
had investigated the charge that the
hospitals were overcrowded and he was
satisfied that such was not the case.
At 4 o'clock the commission ad
journed until to-morrow when General
Wheeler will resmue his testimony.
General Fitzhugh Lee has notified the
commisÃton that he will not be able to
appear before Thursday.
HARD WORDS FROM
THE DEMOCRATS
Charge the Military Authorities
With Full Responsibilities
for Army Scandals.
WORCESTER, Mass., Oct. 4.âln
cluded in the platform adopted to-day
by the Democratic State Convention
was the following attack on the admin
istration at Washington:
The military administration during the
recent war has been a stigma on the his
tory of the republic and a disgrace to
civilization. The army which sprang Into
existence has been made the prey of in
competent* and favorites, who have fat
tened on the sorrows of American sol
diers. The brave men who fought our
battles In the West Indies were left with
out ndoquate food, medicine or surgical
assistance.
They were put under incompetent com
manders and were left to nuffer and die
witli undressed wounds and burning?
fevers. And hundreds of their comrades
who have returned alive have come back
emnclnted and ghastly, to stagger
through the streets as living witnesses
against those who were responsible for
their sufferlngra. We demand that a thor
ough Investigation by Congress, not by
an administrative committee organized to
acquit, shall expose the guilty and drive
them mercilessly from the office which
they have disgraced.

* MA"\ANZAS, Cuba, Oct. 4. â Matanzas reconcentrados are, having â¦
* their hunger satisfied with American provisions from the Comal. The *
* thanks of the people find vent in outbursts of "Viva Americanos," *
# whenever Major Wiskern or Captain Niles appears on the street. â¦
# Yet the very men who are loudest in their protestations of grati- *

# of the M--tanzas section of the Cuban national party, a document *
# which goes further in its demands for absolute independence as op- *
â¦ posed to annexation than any other that has yet appeared. The *
â¢ manifesto is addressed to "Hon. William McKinley, President of the *
â¢X- United States," and says in part: â¦
â * "Now is the moment to define the situation in Cuba in regard to *
* its future government. The honest policy of the American Govern- *

make the following declaration to the Government of the United
States:
"That Cuba ought to be free and form an independent nation ruled
by republican institutions, because the efforts of Its children give the
right to liberty.
"That we recognize said government or any other that legitimate
ly may succeed it as our real representative, and believe it is one
called upon to accomplish restoration of order and especially to gov

SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY
COUNTIES FOR GAGE
Leading Democrat of Visalia Declares the Single-
Tax Views of Maguire Will Kill Him
With the Farmers.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 4. â Great boasts have been made by Demo
crats as to the enormous vote Judge Maguire is going to receive in
thÂ«? San Joaquin Valley. From reports received from that section these
claims of Maguire are but idle phantasies. One of the best-known
Democrats in the San Joaquin Valley is E. A. Miller of Visalia,
where he is a prominent attorney. He is now on a visit to this
city. In 18S6, when Washington Bartlett was elected Governor, Mr.
Miller was a candidate on the Democratic ticket for Surveyor Gen
eraL He it Is that asserts with great emphasis that Gage will
carry the majority of the San Joaquin Valley counties. He is him
self a strong Gage man. and in giving his reasons for supporting the
RepubHcan leader he says:
"I have been a Democrat all my life, but this year I shall vote
for Henry T. Gage and against James G. Maguire. I know many
Democratic farmers," said Mr. Miller, "who will not support the
ticket this year. They are opposed to Judge Maguire because of
his views on the single tax. Take my county. Tulare. It gave Bryan
two years ago a majority of nearly 1500. This year the figures will
be cut to about 600. Yolo and other agricultural counties will do
the same. The grand old Democratic party is being fused to
death."

DEMOCRATIC
CANDIDATES
ARE FAVORED
Their Friends Control
the Non-Partisans.
MEMBERS ARE DISSATISFIED
MANY LIVELY TILTS AT THE
CONVENTION.
Judges Wallace, Seawell, Borden Rnd
Troutt Were Indorsed Last
Night for the Superior
Bench.
The Non-Partisan convention met In
Pioneer Hall last night and resumed the
work of indorsing a majority of the nom
inees of Boss Phelan's convention of one
hundred job chasers. In order to prove
their non-partisanship they kindly con
sented to give the Republicans one of the
four Superior Judges, and much against
{heir will they Indorsed R. H. Webster
for Superintendent of Puolic Schools.
Boss Phelan wanted the place to go to
James Dsnman, who has been holding
public positions and offices since 1851, btit
Brother-in-law Sullivan was unable to
hold the forces in hand.
The greatest dissatisfaction exists
among many of the members, owing to
the controlling Influence that has thus
far secured the Indorsement of nearly
every one of Boss Phelan's pet candidates.
The Republican candidates have been
turned down on every possible occasion,
and as one of the p-ectators remarked
last night, the convention would be more
properly named If called "The Demo
cratic Annex." With but few exceptions
the Democrats have carried off all the
prizes, and Boss Phelan and his lleuteD
ants are greatly pleased.
"When the convention was called to or
der last nltrht by Chairman Fitch there
were but few absentees. It was rumored
during the afternoon that there was a
strong possibility of an open revolt among
some of the delegates, and Boss Phelan
had all his men on hand.
When Secretary Milliken proceeded to
read the minutes of the preceding indors
ing meeting, Charles Bundschu moved
that the reading be dispensed with, as no
one was listening to him.
Some one suggested that they be read
anyhow, as a matter of form, and Secre
tary Milliken proceeded.
On motion of C. B. Perkins, the com
mittee on hall was authorized to secure
headquarters, -where the campaign com
mittee will hold forth and "direct a vig
orous campaign."
E. J. Le Breton next touched upon the
matter of finances. He believed that the
nominees of the convention should be
called together in order that the cam
paign committee might "suggest" to them
that contributions would be acceptable.
He desired it understood that contribu-
tions would not be "demanded." but that
only a suggestion would be made that
they give the committee about 20 per cent
of the sum they are allowed by law to
spend in making- a canvass.
Ex-Mayor Ellert objected to any such
procedure. "It is getting back to the
principles of the old parties." said he.
"and the 'suggestion' of contributions wo
all know is practically a demand for the
same. We are supposed to be here in a
reform movement. If the public doesn't
want to sustain us by furnishing the
needed funds to carry on the campaign,
we might just as well give up the reform
idea."
C. B. Perkins thought that it would be
better to call the candidates together and
have it "intimated" to them thr. t they
contribute. Perkins' idoa met with fa
vor, so it will only be "intimated" instead
of "suggested" to the candidates thnt
they "contribute" to the campaign fund.
"I have a communication here from M.
C. Haley," said Secretary Milliken. "but
I don't suppose that you care to hear it."
The Phelan delegates didn't care to
hear It, so they had it placed on file in
the archives of the convention. The com
munication was as follows:
To the members of the Citizens' Non-
Partisan Convention â Gentlemen: At the ses
sion of your convention last evening in the
discussion growing out of my candidacy before
you for the nomination for County Clerk. I
feel that a grievous wrong was unintentionally
done me by one of *he speakers, the chairman
of the committee on municipal nominations.
I feel that a serious reflection was cast upon
me, both as to the honesty of my candidacy
and the character of my support. *f at any
time In my life in my appearances befor*
nominating conventions or before the people
as a candidate for office, I have ever received
any support from rler- nts in our community
other than the good citizenship 'thereof. I am
not aware of the fact. I do, however, know
that I have never solicited any support for
which I owe any apology or explanation, even
to myself.
My position in this respect, I believe, has
always been too well defined to require any
defense, and too well known, I hope, to be
seriously effected by any attack that may be
made upon me.
As to the good faith of my candidacy. I can
only refer to the gentleman to whose remarks
I find myself compelled to take exception-
Mr. Le Ureton. He certainly knows that from
the day of my first interview with ivan upon his
own invitation, nearly a month ago, I relied
upon being able to make a successful canvass
for the office of County Clerk upon your nomi
nation. My judgment may be attacked, but not
my good faith. I cheerfully accept the result
of your good action last night.
I can afford to lose your nomination and
rnnM :ifT. H to ].->Â«.<> the election, if nominated,
b-jt I cannot afford to have my motives Im
pugned and have all I possess in the worldâ
my good r.ame â destroyed. M. C. HALKT.
E. J. Le Breton then rose to a question
of personal privilege and asked what ac
tion the convention intended taking on
the resolution Introduced at a previous
meeting requesting Assessor Siebe to ap
pear before that body and explain the
charge made that lie had shown partiality
in the levying of two assessments.
"I do not desire." said he. in conclusion,
"to in any way Injure the candidacy of
Mr. Siebe. but I think that some definite
action should be taken on the resolution."
After Le Breton had spoken his mind on.
the proposition, L. R. Ellert arose to a
point of order and said with his eye on
Le Breton: "All the harm that is being
done to Mr. Siebe Is being done now. Mr.
I>Â» Breton has belittled him all that he
could on the floor this evening. Mr. Siebe
is my friend. I believe that this resolu
tion introduced last night is in very bad
taste and that It should be rescinded. I
don't do it to defend Mr. Siebe for any
thing that he has done wrong, for I don't
bellwe that he has done it. I therefore
move that the resolution be withdrawn."
George L. Center, the author of the
resolution, explained that the honesty of2
Mr. Siebe was not in question. The sub
ject was a case of alleged partiality.
"We have indorsed this man on our
ticket." said he. "We are before the peo
ple and we ought to give him a chance
to explain this thing, and I don't know
of any better way to have him do it
than by means of the resolution which I
introduced. Mr. Ellert here has made a
counter attack on Mr. Le Bretonâ"
"I made no attack on Mr. Le Breton,"
interrupted Ellert.
"Mr. Le Breton is a banker," said Mr.
Center, "and your remarks the other
night about the bankersâ"
"Mr. Le Breton is able to take care of
himself," returned Ellert dryly.
E. A. Denicke indorsed Mr. Ellert's mo
tion. "I think it is not only in very bad
taste." he said, "after a committee has
reported favorably on a candidate and
after his name has been put on the
ticket by a two-thirds majority that he
should be brought before another com
tee. It is not only in very bad taste, but
It is a very bad precedent as well.
"I suspect the intention of the question
and I am somewhat disgruntled, not that
J am afraid that Mr. Siebe cannot show
the people a clear history, but because it
shows a baii light on our convention for
wire-working, and we should not lower
ourselves to it. Parties come up before
this convention, and in a roundabout
way try to besmirch him. It is wrong and
not dignified."
Charles Bundschu approved of the re
marks of Denicke and said that only a
few minutes previously a letter written
NON-PARTISANS IN ACTION AND REPOSE.
by a defeated candidate was laid upon the |
table. It was not honorable to reopen the !
question after Mr. Siebe had been placed |
on the ticket. Mr. Ellert's motion was !
put and carried by a viva voce vote.
Chairman Fitch then announced that it
wa.s next in order to nominate a candi
date fur Superintendent of Streets.
The municipal committee reported in fa
vor of R. P. Doolan, the Phelan nominee.
"I hope that we will get a few Repub
licans on our ticket." said L. R. Ellert,
on placing the name of Martin Fragley,
the Republican nominee, before the con
vention. "It is getting monotonous sit
ting here indorsing Democrats," he add
ed, "and Martin Fragley is entitled to
every consideration at the hands of the
convention. He is honest and capable,
and he made one of the best Superintend
ents we ever had in charge of the House
of Correction."
The roll was called, and as Doolan was
"slate" he received 28 votes to Fragley's
17. There was no choice and a second bal
lot was ordered.
"I withdraw the name of Martin Frag
ley." said Ellert. "for I see. he doesn't
stand a show here."
The secretary was then instructed to
cast the ballot for Doolan, and Brother
in-law Sullivan smiled contentedly.
Franklin K. Lane was the choice of the
investigating committee for City and
County Attorney.
Ellert presented the name of William
F. Fitzgerald, the Republican nominee.
"We have nominated a Democrat for Su
perintendent of Streets and a Democrat
for Sheriff, a Democrat for Tax Collector,
a Democrat for County Clerk. I don't
see any use of sitting here as non-parti
sans and nominating none but Democrats.
If there is any reason why William F.
Fitzgerald should not receive this nomi
nation, I would like some one to Inform
"It is high time," said Le Breton, rather
angrily, when Ellert sat down; "that this
practice of reminding us every few min
utes that we are only nominating Dem
ocrats was stopped. I question very
much if the delegate who does so has
any place in a Non-Partisan convention. "
"I want to state right here," exclaimed
BUert, "that I am not bogs ridden or
hidebound to any boss. When it comes
to non-partisanship I might remind the
convention that I was the first man nom
inated by the Non-Partisans when the
organization came into existence. What
I say about nominating too many Demo
crats is true. If we continue on in this
way the public will have no confidence
In us, and the party will lose prestige.
I don't see why I should be singled out
and vilified for expressing my views. I
think the attack is in very bad taste."
The roll was called and Lane was nom
inated on the third ballot. The first bal
lot stood: Lane 26, Fitzgerald 19; second,
Lane 28, Fitzgerald lti; third, Lane 35,
Fitzgerald 9. _
R. H. Webster and James Denman
were placed in nomination for Superin
tendent of Schools.
C. A. Murdock, E. A. Denicke and
George Cumming advocated the candi
dacy of Webster, while D. I. Mahoney and
Charles Bundschu favored the cause of
Denman, who was Phelan's candidate.
Their oratory was of no avail, however,
for Webster was nominated on the first
ballot by a vote of 29 to 14.
who 1 was Phelan's candidate. Their ora
tory was of no avail, however, for Web
ster was nominated on the first ballot by
a vote of 29 to 14.
On recommendation of the educational
committee, the secretary was instrscted
tc cast the ballot for the following can
didates for school directors, there being
no opposition:
Armer, C. P. Eells, T. J. Ly
ons, A. Eichler, H. N. Brandenstein, W.
M. Cannon, Vanderlynn Stow, H. M. Hol
brook, W. G. Stafford, E. L. Head, P. A.
Bergerot, J. M. Thomas.
The last work of the night was the nom
ination of four Superior Judges. The com
mittee reported in favor of Rhodes Bor
den, J. M. Seawcll, William T. Wallace,
Democrats, and James M. Troutt, Repub
lican. The committee feeling sure in the
"slate" going through had ballots printed
with only the four names on them, not
withstanding the fact that the names of
Davis Louderback, Frank J. Murasky,
John B. Carson, F. W. Van Reynegom,
W. T. Schell, H. W. Philbrook and H. M.
Clement had also been presented.
D. I. Mahoney then formally placed
Davis Louderback in nomination. The
first ballot resulted in the nomination of
Wallace, Borden and Seawell, the vote
standing: Borden 31, Wallace 34, Seawell
37, Troutt 26, Louderback 29, Murasky 3,
Philbrook 4, Clement 10.
A second ballot to fill the fourth place
followed, but there was no choice, Troutt
receiving 19, Louderback 22 and Clement
2 votes. The third ballot stood Troutt 22,
Lourterback 21, and on the fourth ballot
Troutt received 25 and Louderback 19
votes. Troutt was thereupon declared the
choice of the convention.
An adjournment was then taken until
to-night. __

REMEMBERS VETERANS' SCARS. \
Army and Navy League Pleads That â 
the Old Soldiers Retain Their
Franchise Privileges.
The Army and Navy League have !
adopted resolutions denouncing the ac- |
tion of Abbott Klnney of Los Angeles In :
bringing suit to disfranchise 2000 old army i
veterans now wards of the old Soldiers' i
Home at Santa Monica. A portion of the j
resolutions reads as follows:
A Democrat of Los Angeles, aspiring to be
United States Senator, has brought suit to dls- i
franchise our comrades in the National Home
at Santa Monica, and to rob them of their clti- i
zenship and place them upon the plane of j
"paupers." When men who have been tried
in the furnace of war, stood shoulder to shoul
der with us, fought the battles of our country,
endured the horrors of prison pens, suffered !
from wounds and disease, sacrificed their
health and strength to save the nation, and '
now in their old age and decrepitude given asy- \
lum by a grateful Government, are thus as
sailed and a mean attempt is made by a
"Popo" Democrat to rob them of their right
to vote, the time has come, we say, for us to |
get right out on guard, do hard political work '
and vote the straight Republican ticket from its !
top to its bottomâ not even casting a vote for a â 
"Popo" Democratic Coroner, as he might "rob I
the dead."
The circular to which these resolutions j
will be appended Is signed by J. Murray
Bailey, adjutant general, and W. H. Sea
mans, eommander-in-chief. These gentle- \
men intend to circulate at least ten thou
sand copies within the next few days.
Between forty and fifty new cumps will
be established at an early date. The !
league will hold a meeting next Friday
at 2 p. m. for the purpose of appointing i
sub-committees who will keep tab on mv- ;
niclpal and local affairs.
ARCHITECTURAL JURY
FINISHES ITS LABORS
I
Besult of Competition for the Phebe
Hearst Plan for the Univer
sity of California.
NEW YORK, Oct. 4.â A Journal special
from Antwerp says: The jury in the in
ternational competition for the Phebe
Hearst architectural plan for the Univer
sity of California concluded its labors to
day. Plans to the number of 100 were sub
mitted and examined. Eleven were found
to possess such merits as to entitle their
authors to rewards of $12W) each and the
right to enter into the ttnal competition.
Negotiations are in progress for the pur
chase of several plans, outside of those
selected for final competition, which were
considered by the jury to be useful to the
university.
The members of the jury, together with
the successful architects, will be taken
to California and there enteftained by
Mrs. Hearst, and in June, 1899, the jury
will there select a plan, which must be
approved by the Regents of the Univer
sity of California.
At the banquet given last evening by
Mrs. Hearst to the authorities of Antwerp
and the jury, Mr. Pascal, president of the
lury, in responding to a toast, said that
Mrs. Hearst had every right to hope that
the buildings of the University of Cali
fornia would excel any structures exist
ing for a similar purpose.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1898.
DISTRICT REPUBLICANS
, GREET THEIR LEADERS
Henry T. Gage, Patton, Loud and Others Speak
to Two Great Throngs of
Voters.
The Fallacy of Many Democratic Doctrines as Expounded
by Magnire Exposed by the Standard Bearers
of the Good Old Party.
Bonfires on Laguna street at Hayes and
Fulton, and a band at Laguna and
Grove streets, called out a multitude of
men, women and children last evening.
The occasion was a grand Republican
rally at Mowry's Hall under the auspices
of the clubs of the Thirty-seventh and
Thirty-eighth Assembly districts.
Mowry's Hall was packed when ex-Sen
ator Wentworth called the meeting to or
der and introduced James E. Field as
chairman. The presiding officer made a
few appropriate remarks, saying: "We
are here for the purpose of instilling en
thusiasm among the Republicans of the
Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth Assem
bly districts. We are here to indorse
Henry T. Gage for Governorâ (loud ap
plause)â Eugene F. Loud for Congress
and Charles L. Patton for Mayor. (Vo-
ciferous applause.) We want It to be
known that the Republicans are alive to
the importance of the campaign."
The first regular speaker introduced,
Hon. Eugene F. Loud, received a round of
hearty cheers. Mr. Loud recalled some
incidents of his first contest for Congres
sional honors, and observed that the Re
publican party, when it boldly advances
and adheres with courage to its prin
ciples, always succeeds.
The name of President McKinley was
mentioned, and the mention elicited
shouts of applause from the audience. Mr.
Loud referred to the peculiar condition
confronting the Republican party in this
campaign. The fusion nominee says there
is but one issue before the people to-day,
and that is the funding bill. All ratioi.al
people know that that question is settled.
Mr. Maguire refers, I presume, to the
amendment to the deficiency bill.
At some length the history of the legis
lation on this measure was reviewed, and
the position of Senators Morgan and
White defined. On this point Mr. Loud
said, with emphasis: "The understanding
of myself and others was that Mr. Ma
guire assented."
Mr. Loud spoke so earnestly and frankly
on the subjpet that the audience was not
left in doubt as to the fact that Mr. Ma
guire did assent to the settlement of the
railroad question.
Speaking for himself, Mr. Loud declar
ed: "I am prepared to defend tne amend
ment securing the settlement of the fund
ing question from this day to the day of
election. This amendment was adopted
in the Senate without objection."
The Democrats were asked if there
were not other questions confronting the
people. He did not assert that the war
was a Republican war, and could not
imagine how any one could be so preju
diced by party feeling as to advance such
a claim. The war, he said, was a nup
rising of patriotic Republicans, Demo
crats and Populists to uphold the honor
and integrity of the nation. It was an
American war, in which the splendid pa
triotism of the American people was ex
hibited.
Mr. Loud dwelt at len~*h on the oppo
sition of certain Democrats to the war
revenue bill, and remarked that the tak
ing of $200,000,000 of bonds by the Ameri
can people was worth more than an army
of 500.000 armed men. In closing he asked
that California should send this message
to President McKinley: "We have elect
ed the wnole Republican 'fket by 20.000
majority." (Long continued applause.)
The California Glee Club safcg a song
entitled "Gage Is the Man." The singing
called forth plaudits.
Henry T. Gage, the nominee for Gover
nor, accompanied by Colonel George
Stone and J. Alva Watt, entered the hall
while Mr. Loud was speaking. The de
monstrations of applause and the ringing
cheers given for the next Governor did
not disturb the speaker. He waited un
til the tumult of enthusiasm subsided and
then closed his speech as stated.
When Mr. Gage was presented to the
audience the applause was renewed and
prolonged. He was introduced by the
chairman as the nominee of one of the
largest and grandest conventions that
ever assembled in California. After ac
knowledgment of the greeting, Mr. Gage
said:
"The chairman speaks truly when he
says that the Republican convention
which recently assembled in Sacramento
was one of the grandest conventions ever
held in California, yet my distinguished
opponent in this campaign nightly asserts
on his speaking tour that this grand body
of intelligent and independent citizens
was dominated by corruption. He as
sails the integrity and honor of that vast
assemblage of men in which every coun
ty of this State was represented. I repel
the calumny here. I say it is an out
rage that he should denounce these men
as railroad hirelings. I would not so
speak of a Democratic convention. I
would regard it as dishonorable to cast
such an imputation on a body of my fel
low citizens. lam built on different
lines. I believe in the integrity of men
and the virtue of women." (Tremen
dous applause.)
Mr. Gage styled the opposition the
"Confusion party," and quoted from the
party indorsements to prove that the
"Confusion" convention indorsed the
single tax doctrine. He remarked that the
Democrats, alarmed and dismayed over
the situation, were declaring that single
tax was not an issue.
"My opponent." aid Mr. Gage, "has de
clared in Congress in favor of single tax.
The convention of Democrats and Popu
lists Indorsed him. Now tell me, have
they not made his acts .an issue in the
campaign?" \
"If the single tax system of placing all
tax on land should prevail the railroads
would pay no taxes. The farmer who
owned a farm and the mechanic who had
saved a little money to buy a home would
be compelled to bear ail the burdens."
Mr. Gage pronounced the doctrine in
famous and revolutionary. In closing, the
standard bearer predicted Republican suc
cess and promised, if elected to the office
of Governor, to discharge his duties
faithfully.
A recess was taken to give the people
an opportunity to grasp the hand of
their n^xt Governor.
The arrival of Charles L. Patton, Re
publican nominee for Mayor, was the sig
nal for a great demonstration of ap
plause. Mr. Patton maue a frank and
manly speech which won him the instant
favor of the audience. He expressed ab
solute confidence in the new charter. In
dorsed the dollar limit, declared that cor
porations must pay taxes, and promised
if elected Mayor to give the people of
San Francisco a clean, honest and fair
deal.
Speeches were made by A. J. Morgen
stern and Frank McGowan, which enter
tained the large audience and aroused
great enthusiasm. The meeting ad
journed with three cheers for Gage, three
for Loud, three for Patton, three for
Curry, and three for the whole ticket.
This evening Henry T. Gage will speak
at Drew's Hall, 121 New Montgomery
street, and at Cambrian Hall, 1143 Mis
sion street.

GREETING TO GAGE.
The Thirty-Sixth Assembly Dis-
trict Club Holds an Enthu
siastic Meeting.
Mission residents, attracted by a huge
bonfire and the sound of music, were
drawn to Rolander Hall, Twenty-eighth
and Church streets, last evening, the oc
casion being a Republican mats meeting
held under the nuspices of the Thirty
sixth Assembly District Club, in honor
of the standard bearer, who was invited
to address the voters of the district. Be
fore any of the speakers arrived, stand-
Ing and breathing room was at a pre
mium. The stairway leading to the hall
was jammed with men, who. unable to ob
tain admittance, tried to catch at long
range the sentiments expressed by those
who spoke.
The arrival of Henry T. Gage was made
manifest to the more fortunate ones with
in by the enthusiastic shouts of those
on the stairs. As he pushed his way
through the dense crowd he was hailed
with cheers and his hand was shaken by
hundreds before he could reach the plat
form. The moment he stepped inside the
building he was greeted with cheering
that drowned the blare of the brass in
struments that were playing a patriotic
melody.
The shouts and hand shakes were re
peated when Hchj. Charles L. Patton, at
tended by other candidates, entered the
hall. The Republican candidate for Mayor
must have been gladdened with his recep
tion. As his large form loomed up among
the crowd cheers were given in his honor.
President Frank French of the club, un
der whose auspices the meetinK was held,
acted as chairman and Introduced the
many candidates who addressed the meet-
Ing.
Introduced as the next Governor of
California, Mr. Gage stepped forward and
In a short speech told those present In no
uncertain terms that he was going to be
elected. Thirf 1 expression, so confidently
given, seemed to forcibly impress the
gathering, and his .hearers shouted and
stamped approbation. Mr. Gage said he
did not know the people of this city, but
was trying to become acquainted with
them rapidly by making a personal can
vass of the different districts of the city.
He emphatically said that he was not
controlled by boss or corporation. He de
nied that the convention that nominated
him for the important office of Governor
was controlled by a corporation, and add
ed that it was very dishonorable in Mr.
Maguire to say that it was dominated by
corporate influence.
A rousing greeting was accorded Mr. Pat
ton when he was introduced by the chair
man. His voice, though a little hoarse,
due to his constant speech-making, was
heard by those in the outer entrance, tie
endeared himself to the Mission people by
informing them that he had gained his
first education in the Mission schools and
finished it in St. Mary's College, which
was then located on Mission road. He
said he was a native of California and
was always striving for the advancement
of the State.
Mr. Patton said he was in favor of the
Legislature ratifying the charter and in
favor of the city owning the gas works.
If elected to the position of Mayor he
would do all in his power to give the
city a decent and honest government.
He eulogized Mr. Gage as the ideal can
didate, and expressed a hope that the
voters of thÂ« district would help swell
ti?e majority which he prophesied would
be rolled up for him next month. He
then excused himself, stating that he had
to speak at another meeting, and. like
the previous speaker, was enthusiasti
cally received on his way out.
Jabez Swan entertained the audience
with a few songs, and then Judge D. J.
Murphy, candidate for District Attorney
on the Republican ticket, was introduced.
"Those principles, if carried out," he
said, "will be to your detriment, to my
detriment and to the detriment of your
children and my children. Therefore it
is outside of being a Republican that I
oppose his election. While I admire the
man personally I hate his principles. (Ap
plause.) I would not if I could, and I
could not if I would, say one word
against Mr. Maguire personally, and let
no one of his friends understand that I
am referring to him as a man, but sole
ly to his principles, which I believe to
be in deadly conflict with the prosperity
of our country. (Applause.) And I tell
you, my friends, the prosperity of my
country and the good feeling of my
neighbors are far above anything like
holding any office that the public may
give me. . _.
"The other day I got word the Exam
iner was going to begin roasting me in the
next few days. Let me tell you that if
they do, before I get through with this
campaign some one else will get roasted,
and roasted badly."
Judge Murphy told his listeners that if
he were elected the rich man would not
be received in his court with any more
kindness than the laboring man. Deafen
ing applause greeted the close of hi 3
speech.
The Waterman Sisters followed in songs
and received as warm a reception as those^
who preceded them. Their campaign
songs were roundly applauded and they
had to respond to many encores.
Arthur Attridge, candidate for Super
visor from the Eleventh Ward, followed
and said that he was not in the habit of
speaking to such large Republican audi
ences. "This is the largest meeting held
in this district in twenty years, and I
hope other districts will take notice of
our gathering. I thank you all." Chair
man French completed Mr. Attridge's re
/marks by saying that there was not a
political mud-slinging factory in the
United States that could concoct one
sling at him.
A. H. Merrill, candidate for the Assem
bly from the district, also spoke. A. P.
Van Duzer filled in the gap caused by the
wait for Congressman Loud by saying
some harsh things against the doctrines
of Mr. Maguire, the Democratic platform
and the many platforms he has taken
unto himself.
Hon. E. F. Loud was given an ovation
when introduced, and he made a short
but pointed speech on the good deeds
performed by the Republican party dur
ing the past four years.
Coroner W. J. Hawkins followed in a
short speech. E. H. Falvey also ad
dressed the meeting.
The following named gentlemen acted as
vice presidents of the meeting:

Democratic party of San Francisco.
Though he was great he did not abuse
his greatness, for out of the goodness
of his heart he permitted Mayor Phe
lan to live and even went so far as to
permit Andy Lawrence, the political
Pooh-Bah of the Examiner, to say nice
things about him in return for an oc
casional smile or a brief word of greet
ing. It was this kindly trait in his na
ture that finally brought about his
ruin. Had he condemned Phelan and
Lawrence to death he would not now
be skulking in the political back-yani
craving an occasional crust from the
hand of the haughty Sammy Braunhart
or ruining his eyesight gazing at the
dizzy height upon which are perched
the two conspirators wlft brought about
his undoing.
was during the late lamented Dem
ocratic convention at Sacramento that
McNab's hold on the throat of the uni
verse began to slip. He was quick to
notice the first symptoms of w r aning
power and in order to delay the fatal
moment for the longest possible time he
sold his political birthright to Lawrence
and Phelan and trusted to the truth of
the old adage about there being "honor
among thieves" to pull him through to
the end.
It was a fatal error. There is no
honor among political thieves of the
stripe that stole the organization of the
local Democracy. The Whispering Boss,
who had planned and carried out the
hold up, now found himself at the
mercy of his accomplices and in grave
danger of being overlooked when it
came time to make a division of the
spoils. And this is exactly what did
occur.
After the McNab-Phelan job-chasers
who comprise the Committee of One
Hundred had resolved themselves into
a nominating convention for the pur
pose of making themselves candidates
for office, McNab produced a list of the
men whom he wished to ' have nomi
nated for places on the Board of Super
visors. - A hurried consultation was
held and Phelan and Lawrence decided
to take such action as would finally
convince the Whispering Boss: that he
had outlived the period of his political
usefulness. McNab was accordingly
told that under no circumstances would
he hp permittprTtn hnve * hi-i in nam
ing the supervisorial nominees.
Particular reference was made to the
names oi John ii. Hansen and Charles
Wesley Reed which appeared on Mc-
Nab's list of would-be Supervisors. The
first is an attorney who shares offices
with McNab, and the other' is a re
former of much experience and small
success. McNab also wished to have
Eugene Deuprey, who rendered him val
uable assistance in the work of stealing
the control of the local Democracy, re
ceive the nomination for District At
torney, and also to have Thomas Pin
der placed on the ticket as the nominee
for Recorder.
To all of these names and some others
Phelan and Lawrence would not listen-.
Then followed a scene that for a time
promised to end in a personal encoun
ter between the honorable Mayor and
the redoubtable Lawrence on the one
side and the Whispering Boss on the
other. McJlab turned loose a batch of
his choicest epigrams and in return
Lawrence threatened to cartoon, lam
poon and spittoon the erstwhile boss
until all the world would laugh him to
scorn.
As a matter of fact, acting under in
structions from Lawrence, the art de
partment of the Examiner did prepare
a cartoon of McNab dressed in kilts
and posing in an attitude not exactly
complimentary to a simon pure re
former. The literary department of
the same paper was also instructed to
prepare an article describing in detail
all of MeNab's political deformities, as
well as giving prominence to the pur
ity of the motives of the men who had
been his pals in the hold-up whereby
the Democratic voters of San Francisco
were robbed of the right to have a voice
in conducting the affairs of their
party.
Before the cartoon and the accom
panying article could reach the public
McNab weakened and signified his re
luctant consent to take his medicine
and say nothing. And that is why the
cartoon and article did not appear in
the columns of the Examiner. And
that is why the names of Thomas Pin
der, Eugene Deuprey, John H. Hansen
and Charles Weslev "rd do not ap
pear on the Democratic ticket. And
that is why Gavin McNab. the Whis
pering Boss, is sulking in his tent.

PASSING JOKE.
The Republican Ticket Will Benefit

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
&08 Broadway, Oct. 4.
Uneasy lies the head of the Alameda
County candidate for office, for it is just
dawning upon him that one-half of the
mushroom ticket and independent candi
dates have merely been encouraged to
run for office by the voracious "push,"
who see starvation ahead unless some
one "puts up."
The almost limitless list of candidates
has had its effect, and every roisterer
and heeler in the county is in clover. The
breaking up 01: party lines has materially
assisted the plans of the "push" and the
same "worker" now feels at liberty to
approach a Republican or a Populist with
as much confidence as he would a Prohi
bitionist or a Gold Democrat.
Many of the county officials who were
intending to go duck hunting have post
poned their trips, fearing that the enemy
may spread tares among their wheat
while they are banging away at canvas
backs. There are some very warm con
tests to be made before winners can de
clare themselves. John J. jillen, in addi
tion to Harry Dalton, is about the only
man who could go to sleep till November
9 and be confident that he would wake up
to find himself elected to office. In some
of the other contests two or more candi
dates are already claiming the victory,
but the knowing politicians are chewing
an enormous amount of hay in silence and
sawing large sacks of wood. Charley
Spear would feel safer if the car men
talked less about "old man Grim"; W. H.
Church realizes that he has no picnic on
his hands in running for Supervisor,
while County Clerk Jordan does not ex
pect more than 200 majority over the mis
cellaneous man, Tom Stoddard.
It is probable that all the independent
candidates and the dissatisfied fusionists,
non-fusionists, Populists, Democrats, Sil
ver Republicans and Gold Democrats will
so split the stray vote in all directions
and among so raanv. candidates that the
Republican ticket will be elected from
top to bottom. The so-called Independent
Republicans, who nominated a lot of
Democrats. Populists and Prohibitionists,
ere not taken very seriously. The legis
lative portion of their ticket is regarded
somewhat in the light of a joke, and it is
even said that some of the nominees do
not care two straws whether their names
go upon the ballot or not.
This evening there were several genu
ine Republican rallies at different points
of the city, and the enthusiasm and con
fidence of the party were shown to be in
creasing.
The Fruitvale Republican Club was ad
dressed this evening by Victor H. Met

ABATTLESHIP ILLINOIS LAUNCHED
aT THE NEWPORT NEWS YARD
NEWPORT NEWS, Va., Oct. 4.â
Newport News was thronged
with visitors to-day from far and
near, who came to witness the
launching of the battleship Illi
nois. Chicago was represented by del
egations of prominent men and women,
â while the near-by cities and villages
practically emptied themselves of their
population in order to assist the Slate
of Illinois in honoring the baptism of
the great ship which is to bear the
name of the Prairie State.
A conservative estimate placed the
crowd of visitors at fully 20.000, and it
Is believed th:u fully .30,000 persons wit
nessed the ceremonies attendant upon
the launching. The weather was ideal.
Among the prominent persons from j
the national capital was Assistant Sec

The reply is expected on Friday and
the adjournment of the commission for

Mr. Day is empowered, however, to

the great vessel moved down the ways
cheer after cheer went up from the
multitude of spectators, whose enthu
siastic shouts almost drowned the
noisy welcome to the newcomer sound-
missioners his personal views and those
of Rear Admiral Dewey regarding the
physical, geographical, moral and po
litical conditions prevailing in the
Philippine Islands.
General Merritt's exposition of his
personal views and judgment of the
Philippine Islands was not finished to
day and he will meet the commission
again to-morrow when he will continue
to discharge his errand here.
The Spanish commissioners were re
ceived this afternoon at 4 o'clock by
President Faure at the Elysee Palace.
Immediately following- the reception
of the Spaniards the members of the
American Peace Commission were re
ceived by President Faure at the Elysee
Palace.
General Porter presented Judge Day
â¢ and the other members of the commis- ;
sion in turn, after which Judge Day ;
1 presented to President Faure a cable
message from President McKinley. It
read as follows:
On this occasion, when the commissions
of the United States and Spain arc about
to assemble at the capital of France to
I negotiate peace, and when the repre- i
sf-ntatives of this Government are receiv- i
; Ing i!ie hospitality and the good will of!
; t'n>' republic. I tender to you my mnst
friendly personal greeting and the assur- ;
| ances of my grateful appreciation of your
! kind courtesies to the American Commis
j sior.'
President Faure, in replying, cour
teously expressed his appreciation of
the cordial sentiments uttered and
heartily reciprocated thorn. President
Faure said that everything possible
would be done for the comfort of the
commissioners and added that he would
Immediately transmit directly to Presi
dent McKinley his reply to the latter's
cordial message.
The following is the text of Presi
dent Faure's cable message to President
McKinley:
I have had great pleasure in recei%'ing
the American plenipotentiaries to the Tlis
lano-Amcrican Peac <'ommission. Dur
iiiK the course of an audience Mr. Day
read the telegram which you so gra
ciously sent to me. I am very much
touched by the sentiments which your
excellency has been kind enough to ex
press, and I heartily tliank you for them.
I hope the American Commissioners will
have kind recollections of their sojourn
hi Paris, which I shall try to render
agreeable to them, and I sincerely hope
for a happy termination of the pacific
work of the commission.
La Patrie this evening prints an in
terview said to have been had with
General Rafael Correrro y Saenz, of
the Spanish Peace Commission, in
which be is represented as saying:
"Peace between Spain and the United
States will complicate all the Eastern
questions. The day upon which the
preliminaries are signed the first chap
ter in the new history of L'urope will
be commenced, as the United States
henceforth will play a preponderant
role in the events of which different
parts of the world will be a theater.
"The North Americans will be com
pelled to create all the naval forces de
manded by the situation brought about
by events. The stronger the United
States are, the more their friendship
will be sought after, and also the more
rivalry will there be among the Euro
pean nations.
â¢'Look at the extreme Orient, where
France, Russia, Germany and England
are powerful rivals. If the Americans
install themselves In the Philippines the
situation will be greatly mixed, and
they will not hesitate to seek the
friendship of Japan and England to the
detriment of all other nations. This
will bo for America a truly privileged
situation but the diplomatic role will
bo rendered proportionately moro diffi
cult."

LAWS TO GOVERN
HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
Report Drafted by the
Commission.
BILL TO BE RECOMMENDED
, 1
WILL HAVE A FULL-FLEDGED
CONGRESSMAN.
Coolie Question to Be Met With Iron-
Clad Rules in Conformity With
the Chinese Restric
tion Act.
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
HONOLULU, Sept. 24.â The com
mission having finished its sittings in
â¢ Hawaii and left for home it will now
be in order to state what has been ac
complished. At the outset it may be
said that the work is complete - 1 all but
the finishing touches ' n the main re
port and one bill, on which President
McKinley's wishes have to be con
sulted.
While it is to be called the Territory
of Hawaii, the Government will be an
enlarged territorial one, something
half way between a Territory and a
State. Government by a commission
or on the* lines of the District of Co
lumbia ha' 1 never been seriously con
sidered. . some matters Hawaii will
be confine * to the privileges of a Ter
ritory, while in others it will have
those of a State.
The Territory of Hawaii will have
a Legislature and will make its own
laws, subject to approval or rejection
by Congress. There will be no change
from the present form of the Legis
lature, and its numerical strength and
apportionment of districts, etc., re
main untoiiched.
The new Territory of Hawaii will
have one representative in Congress at
present, but he will be a full fledged
one, not an ordinary Delegate with no
vote, who can only be heard on ques
tions concerning his own Territory.
The Congressman from Hawaii will
have the same. rights as one from Ohio,
a concession made to the growing
importance of Hawaii from a geo
graphical, naval and military stand
point.
The property qualification of $1500 in
real or $3000 in personal estate to make
an elector eligible to vote for the Sen
ate is done away with. To vote for a
Senator in the Territory of Hawaii an
elector must possess an annual income
from some source of $600. In every
thing else the franch ! ~^ is free and un
restricted by any qualification, educa
tional or otherwise.
The indorsement of the Washington
members of the commission has been
eagerly sought by friends of Minister
Sewall and President Dole early and
often, but the subject being a delicate
one no reference to it will be made
in the Commissioners' report. Being
a Democrat, Senator Morgan will have
nothing to do with' the question, be
lieving that President McKinley's
choice should be unhampered. It may
be said that personally Senator Cul
lom's sympathies are with Minister Se
wall, while those of Congressman Hitt
are for President Dole.
It has been decided that the Gover
norship of Hawaii !s to be a much more
important office than that of other new
Territories, consequently the salary will
be commensurate with the office. It
will be either $6000 a year, or $5000, with
an extra thousand for expenses, pracÂ»
tically the same thing. The salary
and .status of the office having been
raised above the usual run of Terri
torial Governorships, there will be n&
other candidates than those mentioned
above, particularly in view of the pos
sibilities of a United States Senator
ship to be evolved in the future. it is
for this reason the Star learns that one
machinery.
Immediately after the launching sev
eral hundred guests of the Newport
News Shipbuilding and Drydock Com
pany boarded the steamer Newport
News for Old Point, where they were
entertained at a luncheon and banquet
at the Chamberlain Hotel. Toasts
of the foremost of Ohio's politicians,
a gentleman high in the councils of
President McKinloy and the Republican
party, a man who has only to ask for
the position to obtain the appointment,
is only awaiting the report of the com
mission to ma'-e known his candidacy,
and of course there will be any number
of other applicants as soon as the
amount of the salary becomes known.
The present judiciary system of Ha
waii will remain undisturbed. The Su
preme Court will probably be ffiven
Federal jurisdiction in United States
cases and the Judges will be appointed
for four years instead of life.
Much has been said and written as
to the position of the Cabinet before
the commission. Certain questions in
writingr were drawn up by the commis
sion and referred to the Cabinet for
answer. They were answered in writ
ing and the members of the Cabinet
alpu gave such information to the com
mission, as was required of their seve
ral departments. In this connection it
may be stated that the commission
takes back to Washington the most
complete and exhaustive data concern
ing every detail of the different de
partments. Senator Cullom has a com
plete inventory of everything trans
ferred to the United States under the
Newlands resolution, even down to
chairs and tables. Minister Damon
has had to furnish elaborate statistics
from the Customs and Postal bureaus,
as well as complete statements of the
present financial status of the Govern
ment, the currency and coin in circu
lation, while the other Ministers have
had to furnish similar data from their
departments. When the commission
deposits its record in Washington the
officials there will be able to put their
ringers on any data concerning Hawaii
at a moment's notice.
There have been rumors on the
street for several days that there was
a division in the commission, and that
its sittings here have not been as har
monious as might be. This is not so.
While there have been differences of
opinion there has been no dissension or
acrimonious feeling. For instance, on
the question of suffrage, there was a
division. Senators Cullom and Mor
gan were opposed to any restriction,
while the two Hawaiian members
wanted the present restrictions main
tained. Congressman Hitt took the
middle view, favoring a small income
qualification, and thus an agreement
was finally reached.
It may be stated on this head that
all memorials and petitions have been
of no avail. The terms of. the New
lands resolution and the Chinese re
striction act are so strong as to leave
the commission no choice but to submit
to the ironclad rules laid down.
Contrary to the impression which has
heretofore prevailed, the several bills,
with one exception, which are to be pre
sented with the report, are already pre
pared, and will go at once to the Con
gressional printing office. The com
mission being empowered to present a
report and such bills as may be requi
site it will not be necessary for the bills
to be presented and by a vote passed
to print, as Is usual with new bills.
The main report will he in manuscript
for the President'" use only, but It Is
considered likely that It will be incor
porated In a special message to Con
gress and thus be made public.
It is understood that the question of
citizenship will be referred to the State
Department at Washington for final
decision. This being settled, the com
mission has only to meet in Washing
ton on November 14. incorporate the
decision In their report and final bill
and their labors will he nt an end.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Oct. 4.â The
United States transport Obdam, which
left here on Sunday, has returned with
her bunkers on fire. The presence of
fire was discovered yesterday morning
at 10 o'clock in the main hold, which
was at once flooded with tons of water
and a pang of men was put at work re
moving the ammunition, of which the
ship carried a large supply. All the offi
cers and soldiers who were well enough
to do so worked hard to extinguish the
flames. Every means available is now
being employed to extinguish the fire,
ami it is hoped she will be able to leave
here again in three days.

were responded to by Governor Tanner
of Illinois, Governor Tyler of Virginia
and other prominent guests. A launch
ing hop was given at the Chamberlain
Hotel this evening.
The Illinois will be the biggest and
most powerful and probably the most
effective battleshin in the United States
navy. Larger than the lowa and
heavier than the Oregon, the Illinois is
still so designed that Â»he will be able
to enter any harbor open to the smaller
battleships, while, in the matter of
speed, she will rank with any of them.
The most striking difference between
the Illinois and the battleships now in
service is the high freeboard of the for
mer, enabling her to fight her guns
from their great elevation above the
water in seas so heavy that the guns
of the lower vessel would be sub
merged and useless. Splendid sea
going powers are also expected to re
sult from this increased freeboard, by
which is 'meant the height of the hull
above the water line.
The dimensions â¢>* the Illinois are as
follows: length on load water line,
368 feet; beam, extreme, 7? feet 2^
inches; draft on normal displacement
of 111,525 tons, 23 feet 6 inches: maxi
mum displacement, all ammunition and
stores on board, 12,325 tons; maximum
indicated horsepower (estimated), 10,
000; probable speed. 16V2 knots; normal
coal supple 800 tuns; coal supply, loose
storage, 1200 tons; full bunker capacity,
1400 to 1500 tons.
Complement of officers, 40; seamen,
marines, etc., 449.
The main battery will consist of four
13-lnch breech-loading rittes in Hich
born balanced turrets oval in shape,
and placed in the center line of the
vessel, and fourteen 6-inch rapid fire
guns. The secondary battery will con
sist of sixteen 6-pounder rapid fire
guns four 1-pounder rapid fire guns,
two Colt guns and two field guns. She
will carry four torpedo tubes.
There will be two sets of triple ex
pansion, twin-screw engines, each in
its own separate water-tight compart
ment The collective indicated horse
power will be about 10.000. with 120 rev
olutions per minute, stroke four feet.
The first keel plate of the vessel was
laid February 10, 1897, not quite twenty
months ago, and the percentage of
work completed to this date, based
upon the vessel fitted out and ready
for sea, is now reported as between 53
and 54 per cent. The contract price
was $2,595,000, and the date of comple
tion is stated to be October 5, 1599.
CUBAN BOARDS IN
JOINT CONFERENCE
First Session Held at
Havana.
DISAGREEMENT IS PROBABLE
SPANIARDS WILL WORK TO OB
TAIN DELAY.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS9S, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 4.â There was a
joint session of the commissions this
morning, as arranged by General Clous,
Captain Hart, Colonel Giranta and Ma
jor Benetez. Even the Commissioners
themselves were in the dark before the
meeting as to the method of procedure
and the extent of the programme.
One thing was considered certain:
that the date of evacuation would be
the first matter discussed. Other topics
which it was expected would be taken
up were the order in which the Spanish
troops should move, the opening of
ports to admit relief supplies, the clear
ing of the districts of Spanish soldiers,
the abrogating or modifying of the
orders of concentration so that the Cu
bans can go to work and defining the
property to be relinquished and to be
taken to Spain by the Spanish troops.
The session has every prospect of be
ing a lengthy one, progress being slow
on account of the necessity of employ
ing interpreters. The probability is that
each side will want separate confer
ences on various points brought up.
The Americans intend to insist on
prompt action, while the Spaniards will
urge the great difficulties in the way of
a movement earlier than on the dates
they named. A disagreement will prob
ably result and the Spaniards may ap
peal to Madrid, similar action being
taken by Americans, who will appeal to
Washington.

NATIONAL ISSUES
ARE PARAMOUNT
Thus Declares Colonel
Roosevelt.
ACCEPTS THE NOMINATION
PLEDGES SUPPORT TO SARA
TOGA PLATFORM.
Believes the American Army and
Navy Should Be Strengthened
to Meet All Demands
Upon It.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 4.â The committee
appointed to notify the candidates
nominated by the State Republican
Convention at Saratoga went to the
home of Colonel Roosevelt, the nomi
nee for Governor, at Oyster Boy, L. L,
to-day. Senator Platt was unable to
attend through illness. Dr. Chauncey
M. Depew made the noti f ation address
to Colonel Roosevelt, t. omplimenting
him on the unanimity of his choice by
the convention. Colonel Roosevelt re
plied as follows:
I herewith accept the nomination ten
dered by the Republican party in con
vention assembled. J deeply feel the re
sponsibilities which attach to the chief
executive of a commonwealth larger and
more populous than many an Oid World
kingdom. In accepting this nomination
at the hands of the authorized committee
of the Republican State Convention I take
this opportunity of extending through you
to the Republicans of the Empire State
my heartfelt thanks for the distinguished
honor conferred upon me. If elected I
shall strive to administer the duties of
this high office in the interests of the peo
?le of the State as a whole, knowing that
owe my position to the people, and to
them I shall hold myself accountable. I
take it that the promises made in the
platform adopted at Sarataga are as bind
ing as any others, and to the fulfillment
of the pledges made therein I promise my
best efforts. The party's past has been
f:lorious, and, while this does not atone
or failure to perform present duty, it
does give adequate reason for believing
we shall meet each duty right, so that
the party in the future may give as great
a cause for thankfulness and pride as do
the achievements of the past.
National issues are paramount this
year. It is not more possible to conduct
a State election now without regard to
national Issues than it was possible so
to conduct one in 1861 or 1563. As it then
was, so it now is the interest of the
nation as a whole which is of vital and
absorbing interest to every citizen. Then,
as now, the Republican party was forced
to find new issues, to confront new prob
lems. Then, as now, it was forced to
make precedents. In ISSI we had to pre
serve the republic for its great destiny;
in 189S we have to take a long stride
toward the accomplishment of lat des
tiny. The Republican party, therefore, in
its State platform, does well to reiterate
the promise under which it was possible
to elect a Republican President, pledges
which made it possible to restore prosper
ity to our country, and to put the nation
where it is possible to work out the glo
rious future which is now before a united
nation.
The issues for honest morfey, for protec
tion to American industry, for the up
building of a merchant marine adequate
to carry the commerce of the world, and
to form a naval militia in times of war,
are as vital this year as they were In the
great contest which was so successfully
fought In 1596. We must further strength
en our navy and build up our army, so
that they may be equal to meet every
demand made upon them, as we. work out
our destiny. Hawaii and Porto Rico are
ours and in the East and West Indies the
Interests of the nation shall be safe
guarded.
Nor is it alone on national Issues that
the Republican party has its duties to per
form. Its record made by the Republican
administration of the State of New York
Is a guarantee that upon all questions af
fecting the property rights and interests
and liberty of all citizens the Republican
party can be safely trusted. As we pledge
ourselves to uphold the national honor
abroad, we pledg* ourselves to enforce
strict honesty at home.
The National Guard must be raised to
and kept at the highest standard of effi
ciency. It has amply proved its courage
and patriotism and we are bound to see
that soldiers so brave and so willing are
properly armed and are handled on the
best possible system.
I heartily concur In the doctrines enun
ciated at Saratoga, and if elected. I shall
earnestly strive to discharge the duties of
the chief executive that at the time of the
end of my term the people shall find that
their interests have been safe In my
hands.
SALINAS' NEW BRIDGE OPEN.
Fine Structure Built by the Spreckels
Sugar Company.
SALINAS, CaL, Oct. 4.â The new pier
bridge over the Salinas River near the
sugar factory was reported completed
and ready for use this afternoon. The
bridge, which is undoubtedly the finest
in the county, was built for the Spreckels
Sugar Company. It has six spans, each
sixty feet long, with two approaches of
forty feet each, and tracks for
both narrow and broad gauge cars.
There is also a wagon road on
either side of the track and passenger
walks. Underneath the bridge pipes have
been laid = connecting the large 1,300.000
gallon reservoir on the hill with the fac
tory buildings. The piers are sold and
built to resist the onslaughts of debris
and water during floods. Ninety days
were consumed in building the structure,
which cost the company over $20,000.

BLEACHING BONES
TELL THE FATE OF
JACKSON'S MEN
How the First Attempt to Carry
Mail Into the Yukon in
Winter Failed.
Harrowing Tale of Starvation, of Insanity From
Want and of Possible Murder and
Cannibalism.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of The CaJl.
JT'NEAU, Alaska, Sept. 2.").â The dis
covery last week near Lake Atiin, the
central location of the now placer dig
gings, of parts man skeletons
picked clean of iiesh by wild beasts,
hay brought to light a peculiar story
of insanity and death from Btar\
in that rugged region, the creeks of
which were recently found speckled
with gold. Near the first was a jumper
and a pair of overalls rotted on the
ground; at the otht-r, only bones.
In 1595 the first attempt was made to
take mail into the Yukon in winter.
The previous summer John J. Healey,
manager for the Northwestern Trad-
Ing and Transportation Company, sent
out a request to C. S. Johnson, a Ja
neau attorney, to contract with some
body to bring the mail in over the ice.
The headquarters of the company was
then at Cudahy, a post about a mile
and a half below Forty Mile. John.
son has since been appointed United
States District Attorney for Alaska by
President McKir.iey. He was con
firmed by th^ Senate last summer,
about a year later a fight having been
made on him. In 1595 Forty Mile and
Circle were the only settlements of
note on the T.'pper Yukon, for it was
not till the summer of 1536 that â¢'ln
dian George" Cormac stumbled upon
the gold of the Klondike and Dawson
began to be builded. The pay being
good, Johnson had no difficulty in find
ing men to undertake the Job. Old
timers strongly advised against the at
tempt as a reckless risk of life. Some
actually opposed it.
Two ambitious parties were made up.
In one were a printer named Hodges,
Neil, a young Scotchman; "Jimmy"
Jackson, an Indian and the leader, and
three other Indians. Hodges
along about 100 pou -wspapers
and magazines, on which he expected
to make a neat clean-up. Being a
printer, he knew everything. He
thought he was as well posted on what
to wear and what to do as the oldest
Yukoner. Nobody could pass a "gal
ley" to him on Yukon information, for
there were no errors under his "slug," ;
he said.
Poor Hodges! He was even thinly
clad as he sat in the canoe on the sack
containing part of the mail.
Jackson had four dogs and a heavy !
Bled. The dogs weighed no more than j
twenty-five or thirty pounds each. Yu- j
koners wintering In Juneau went down
to the float to see th~m off. They told j
the boys they did not have enough !
grub, and put in a last, but Unheeded,
protest. It was between December 16 :
and 20 that they set out in rough
water and a raw wind. Judge John- :
son kindly Bent along a doz^n cans'
of fresh oysters for Healey ar.-.l other
friends.
The other party was joined by Tom \
Healey, a son of John J. Healey, who !
was then in Juneau. He persuaded
Dan Stewart, an aged prospector who ;
had spent many a season on the other
side of the divide, to go along. The !
old man had some money deposited for j
security in a hotel safe In care of Col- |
onel John Olds. He demanded the !
money. Olds begged him to stay at j
home, urged that he would never get j
to Forty Mile and finally refused to j
deliver over the money. Healey got j
together a lot of cigars and fancy gro
ceries in addition to the necessary sup
plies. That was ail he knew about a
Yukon winter then; he knows more
now. Away they, too. went over the
water, heading for Dyea Inlet and the !
Chilkoot Pass.
Few men in Alaska, or anywhere
else, ever went through the awful ex
perience of "Jimmy" Jackson and his
companions. The following February
some Yukoners, camped for the Win
ter, found Jackson and one of the other
Indians wandering aimlessly around
near Taku arm, close to Lake Atlin,
half dead from starvation and cold.
They had devoured the four dogs, ex
cept half of one animal, which Jack-
Bon carried In the mall sack. Judge
Johnson's oysters had disappeared from
the commissary. Nobody has ever
been able to learn just what the party
went through owing to the inability of
the two natives to express themselves
fluently in English, and also, very
probably, for graver reasons. The dif
ficulties of their undertaking were in
sreased by the fact that they adven
turously set out to reach the Lewis
and then the Yukon River over a new
and little known country lying north of
the head of the Taku River, expecting
to come out Â«n Lake Atlin. High
winds and heavy, drifting snowstorms
were met with almost from the start.
After leaving the canoe it. was r.eces
snry to relay their supplies from one
rache to another. The snow fell so
iwiftly and was so whirled by the
Bowling 1 storms that the trail was lost
md the caches buried out of sight. In
t, few days all the provisions left were
:he few pounds of bacon and flour each
nan packed on his back. It was im

ing. Pears' Soap es-
tablished over ioo

possible to keep up a fire, both on ac
count of the scarcity of wood, the fu
rious winds and the impossibility of
finding or making a well-protected
camp. They huddled close together
for warmth, like shsep in a field. The
bacon was eaten raw and the flour
swallowed by moistening it in their
mouths with snow. The dismal day
came when they ate the last mouthful
ur paste, the bacon having been
consumed lirst. The thin and famish
ing dogs added their howls to the la
mentations of the situation. Gaunt
specters of starvation danced around
them on the snow and shrieked in
laughter with the wind.
Hedges became crazed and wandered
away alone, clasping to his breast a
letter that had been intrusted to his
especial care.
Next marning Neil, also, was miss
ing. He, too, had shown signs of in
sanity from weakness. What became
of the two other Indians is likely to
remain a riddle forever. Jackson said,
"He lost," and that was all he ever
would say about it. There are those
who suspect they were made unwilling
sacrifices by Jackson and his friend.
Among Alaska Indians in case of life
or death there are said to have been
instances of "dog eat dog," but only in
such extremity. But it is more prob
able that the other two natives, if
killed, were sent to the happy hunting
grounds in order to decrease the de
mand on the diet of real dog.
When all were huddled together in a
hole in the snow the mail was aban
doned. The Indians selected a few
letters which, from th^ sign and ap- i
mcc of the envelopes, appeared tt, i
be the most important, and which they j
placed inside the lining of their clothes, j
Faithful so far as possible to their j
trust, Jackson and the other man still
had a few letters when found. Th^y j
were helped down the Lewis River j
to the mouth of 'He Hootalinqua, !
where some \\^hite men had a little grub !
to spare, and they eventually reached j
Forty Mile in the spring.
The Healey- Stewart party got a good
start, but that -- -s all, except cold
feet. They succeeded in getting their
goods packed to the summit of the
Chilkoot and cached, when a snow
storm fell from heaven and buried the
cache out of sight. The mail was still
at Dyea. Dan Stewart tried to find
the cache by prodding a long iron rod
down Into the snow, but failed. He
froze his feet as solid as twin lasts of
a shoemaker. Old Dan went to bed
in Dyea and never got up till the next
June.
In May another party spied the top
of the cache sticking out of the snow,
the stuff, including the cigars, into
the Yukon and sold it at about $1000
profit. That mail sack was the first
one in in the snring.
A hairpin was found in a pocket of
the jumper rotting with the bones near
the foot of Lake Atlin. It is not de
coro*rs, especially in the presence of the
remains of brave men, to inquire how
a white man caroe by a hairpin, but in
this connection a clew to identification
may be furnished by the query. What
would a native of Alaska be doing with
one? Those bones were all that were
left of brave Hodees or Neil. The skull
among the other scattered bones found
near the head of one of the creeks
emptying into Surprise Lake is not the
skull of an Indian but of a white man.
Old timers assert that there has not
been a real Yukon winter in two years,
and for this reason so many men were
able to get up the river from Dawson
last winter. The thermometer then
ranged from 30 to 60 below. The old
timer says: "Wait till the mercury
hangs around 70 -or 80, with a wind
howling down from the top of the earth
so cold that it stings like a hot iron
that is the customary winter over the
divide." They predict more experi
ences of the kind that went with the
first winter attempt to get mall into
the Yukon if the season approaching is
of the real sort.
PLENTY OF SUPPLIES
FOR THE DAWSONITES
SEATTLE, Oct. 4.â An estimate of
the amount of provisions on the Yukon
River indicates that there will be no

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBEH 5, 1898.
JUDGE MAGUIRE
TALKS AT MERCED
Greeted by an Immense
Audience.
MAKES ANGRY REPLY TO GAGE
CALLS BARNES HIS POLITICAL
CHAPERON.
Denies Republican Claims of Credit
for Success of the War and
Says the Single Tax Is
Not an Issue.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MERCED, Oct. 4.â One of the largest
political demonstrations ever seen in
Merced was that which occurred here
to-night in honor of James G. Maguire.
Judge Maguire, accompanied by E. L.
Hutchison, the fusion candidate for
Lieutenant Governor, arrived in Merced
at 4 o'clock this afternoon over the Val
ley road from Madera. They were met
at the depot by a committee and es
corted to the hotel, where the "Little
Giant" held an impromptu reception.
This evening a mass meeting was held
in the pavilion, which marked the open
ing of the campaign in Merced and
which was attended by an immense
crowd. Great enthusiasm prevailed.
S. C. Cornell, chairman of the Demo
cratic County Committee, called the
meeting to order, and after announcing
the names of the vice presidents intro
duced James F. Peck, the eloquent at
torney, as chairman. After a brief talk
Mr. Peck presented Judge Maguire. who
was received with vigorous applause
and cheers.
Mr. Maguire spoke about two hours,
devoting the major portion of his ad
dress to a reply to his "distinguished
opr-onent." He handled Mr. Gage with
out gloves, subjecting the Republican
candidate to an unmerciful grilling. He
went after General Barnes roughshod
and said that the method pursued by
the opposition was indeed unique â that
of sending a political chaperon around
with their candidate for Governor.
Judge Maguire defended his vote in
Congress on the war revenue hi!!,
sharply criticized the Republican claim
that the recent war was a Republi
can war, and explained his action.re
garding the funding bill.
"The Republicans ciaim the credit
for the successful prosecution of the
war," said Maguire. "Will they as
sume the responsibility for the mis
management of it which resulted in
the great mortality of our troops with
in our own borders? I say it was an
American war, and I am content to let
the mistakes rest as a common sorrow
and the success and glory as a com
mon heritage of the American people."
The speaker's reference to the war
provoked great applause.
Maguire charged that the Republican
State campaign was controlled by
Southern Pacific influence and refused
to discuss the single tax, which, he
said, did not appear as an issue. He
made a masterly address and received
the close attention of his hearers. Mr.
Hutchison followed Mr. Magutre with
a brief speech and the meeting closed
with cheers for Maguire and Hutchi
son and music by the band.

DIFFERENCE 0F OPINION
CAUSES A REMOVAL
Grand Master of the United Work
men Deposes a Committee
Chairman.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 4.â As the result of a
difference of opinion Grand Master Work
man W. H. Miller of the Ancient Order
of United Workmen has removed from of
fice Walter F. McEntire, chairman of the
committee on finance. The matter will
most likely be taken before the Grand
Lodge for final adjudication. Members of
the order question the right of the grand
master to remove McEntire. It is as
serted that the proper course would have
been to prefer charges against McEntire.
CROOK ARRESTED AT SALINAS.
Obtained Money and Food by Imper
sonating a Lodi Handier.
SALINAS, Cal.. Oct. 4.â A man claim
ing to be Hiram Beckman, a prominent
rancher near Lodi. was arrested this af
ternoon for obtaining money and food
under false pretenses. He stated that he
was robbed a short time ago at Paso
Robles Hot Springs of money, a watch
and clothing while a guest at the h<nel
for the benefit of his health, and had
telegraphed his wife at the time, but
owing to her absence north had not re
ceived money. Telegrams sent to Lodi
proved the man, who sticks to his story,
to be a fraud, as Beckman is at Lodi in
good health and has not been away from
home, nor has his wife.
Captain Hansen's Body Recovered.
CAHTO. Cal.. Oct. 4.â The body of Cap
tain Hansen, drowned at Rockport on Sep

WOMEN LOST Oi
MOUNT VESUVIUS
Adventure of a Party of
Americans.
MISLED BY BOGUS GUIDES
WANDER ALL NIGHT THOUGH
BEDS OF ASHES.
With Clothing Scorched and Peet
Blistered They Reach Their
Hotel Almost Dead
2Trom Exhaustion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 4.â A special to the
Herald frpm Chicago says: Five Amer
ican women had a thrilling experience
on the side of Mount Vesuvius early
last week and narrowly escaped with
their lives. They were Miss Elizabeth
Stephenson daughter of former Con
gressman Stephenson of Marietta, Wis.,
who has been selected to christen the
battleship Wisconsin upon the occasion
of her launching at San Francisco on
November 26; Miss Harriet Stephenson,
her sister; Mrs. F. C. Austin and Miss
Marion Austin of Chicago and Miss
Charlotte Holmes of Menominee, Mich.
These women wandered about all
night on the side of the mountain with
scorched clothing and feet blistered
from walking In the hot ashes, every
moment fearing thai waves of lava
might overtake them and bury them
under their fiery masses. They were
also burned and blistered and suffered
greatly from the nervous shock, but
none of them '..ill die. After hours of
uncertainty and fear they finally got
upon one of the by-ways leading down
the sides of the volcano and succeeded
in returning to Naples, where they were
attended by physicians.
The party of women left their hotel
in the evening at about 5 o'clock and
took carriages to the base of the moun
tain, which they decided to ascend as
far as possible in order to get the best
view of the eruption. Before attempt
ing tv ascend they picked up three
Italian guides, being led to believe they
were official guides, but before long
they found the fellows were merely
worthless street characters who were
willing to earn a few dollars but knew
practically nothing about taking care
of those who desired to get to the
crater.
In a short time the women became
aware they were lost, but could get no
help from the guides, who were as
helpless and frightened as themselves.
They were almost asphyxiated by nox
ious gases and soon became almost too
weak to stand up. In this condition
they wandered around, stumbling in
the darkness and frequently falling,
their situation becoming more horrify
ing every moment.
They had practically given up all
hope of escape when they came to a
point from where they got a view of
the lights of Naples. After this the
guides were of some use to them, as
they were able to pilot them to the foot
of the mountain, where the women ob
tained carriages and reached their
hotel completely exhausted and on the
verge of hysteria.
When they had somewhat recovered
they were told women seldom or never
attempted an ascent of the mountain at
night and their journey was exceeding
ly venturesome and foolhardy. They
arrived in Paris to-day and will sail
for the United States on Thursday.

BOTCH WORK ON
THE HIGH SCHOOL
Defects in the San Jose
Building.
HEATING SYSTEM A FAILURE
NO VENTILATORS PLACED IN
THE ROOF.
Two Thousand Dollars Required to
Remedy the Blunders and
There Is No Money to
Foot the Bill. Â£
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 4.â Blunders have
been made in erecting San Jose's new
$75,0^0 high school, and plans and
specifications wantonly disregarded.
The first serious mistake discovered
was reported at to-night's meeting of
the City Board of Education, and from
expressions of members this is but the
forerunner of a series of defects that
will come to light.
When the plans of the school were
first adopted a complete heating and
ventilation system was purchased of
G. H. Tay & Co. of San Francisco for
J5996. The building was accepted by
the City Council about a month ago,
and the bill of Tay & Co. paid in full.
When the heating plant was started
to-day it was found it would not work,
because no ventilators had been left
in the roof. Because of this faulty con
struction the company refused to guar
antee their system, and it will be nec
essary to erect two ventilators in the
roof of 100 square feet each. These
changes will cost several hundred dol
lars.
Another defect is in the ventilating
system. Fans are fixtd to the studding
of the floor of the study hall, and these
shake the room so as to make it im
posible for pupils to use it. This will
also have to be remedied. The chemi
cal and physical laboratories are also
uncompleted. Altogether about $2000
will be needed to place the building in
a satisfactory condition. The high
school finances are short, and it will
be necessary to run in debt for the im
provements.
The salaries of the high school fac
ulty have been reduced about 25 per
cent. There is just about enough
money in the fund to nay them three
fourths of their salaries for the com
ing year, and the teachers have agreed
to take this as payment in full, as the
new charter prohibits incurring indebt
edness for which there is no money on
hand.

MAKES A TRACK RECORD
OPENING DAY'S SURPRISE AT
LOS ANGELES.
Fall Race Meeting of the Sixth Dis
trict Agricultural Society
Begins Under Favorable
Circumstances.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 4.â The Sixth
Agricultural Society's race meet opened
here to-day under favorable circum-
Btances. Balmy weather, a lightning fast
track and a crowd in the grand stand that
made lounging room hard to find gave
ample assurance that the earnest efforts
and hard work of Secretary Thorne will
be crowned with success. Like on all op
ening days many prospective spectators
have not as yet unpacked and dusttu v.ff
their betting clothes. This caused some
little complaint from the betting ring. All
prophesy that the morrow will bring bet
ter things and a rush of larger coin.
In the judg< h stand .1. \V. Rrooks of the
California Jockey Club presided, with L.
M. Thorne ar,d \Y. A. Covarrubias as as
sociates. The starting gate did not arrive
in time to be put into place, and James F.
well, known to the turf as the
"Prince of Starters," swished the flag in
the old-fashioned way. His send-offs gave
perfect satisfaction.
In the betting ring the layers of odds
v.t re arrayed in full war paint. Nathan,
the old-time warrior, chalked prices with
the name of th<> Turf Club; Humphreys
laid against the favorites as usual; Phil
Archibald grew hoarse toward nightfall;
but sure, wri.eheil all
ii his coin; Hughey Jones looked as smil
r, even though the money was
Bcarce; Hurlick lidgeted as ever and Har
lan & k ,v- Co., a local firm,
were t':< re to aci â â mmodate bettors. There I
were also two iU!d books, one with popu
lar Paul Ridley at the helm to handle the
more subdued plungers. A combination
gathered in the shekels of the for
tune tellers and stable lads.
The track was so hard that the patter
ing of the horses' hoofs sounded like hail :
Btonea on a tin roof. The favorites ate â 
the crumbs at that. Amasa being the only |
successful one. The hardest fall experi- j
enced by the crowd was when, in the final I
mile and a furlong run, the hooded Mar
with Piggott up, outfooted from
defeated the 1- :
.vorite Grady, stepping oft the route
in 1:53%, a track record.
The day's sport opened wuh a harness
the 2:16. pace, and Henry Edelman,
was there with a party
-nds in a four-horse tally-ho to see i
: win. The McKinney gelding !
right there, delivering the goods In!
three straight heats, taking the second
For the first heat the books
laid 5 and 6to 1 against him. He was :

. was favorite for the race, but
never had the pleasure of being among
the rirst three at the wire. D.ctatress,
the rare good daughter of the cranky
tvs, was a good second in each j
The first running affair, a flve-furlong
. scramble, drew out a snappy bunch of
selling platers. Piggott's mount. Cas- j
telar. was touted as a good thing- and
did Nad to the stretch; then he faded
away. Petrarch, with Henry Shields up,
0 1 shot, then came along and wn
under restraint from Queen Xubia. ,
Saocy Eyes, the false favorite, was third, i
!â¢'â¢ ;r started in the slx-furlong selling :
sprint for two-year-olds. Gold Fin ruling !
a pronounced 4to 5 choice. The bay colt
off Sir Urian, but when challenged '
st furlong by Ruiz on San Augus- '
tine was not there and lost the verdict :
by a neck in 1:15 1-2. Reina de Cuba!
should run better next time.
Amasa f.'und nothing much to do when :
in the llvi-furlong run for all ages, and,
at odds on, won all the way, deveny rid
den by Mike Hennessey. Celoso is in
better form than for some time, taking
the place from Losette by a head.

PECULIAR POISONS.
GENERATED IN THE HUMAN BODY.
The Result of Imperfect Digestion
of Food.
Every living thing, plant or animal
contains within itself the germs of cer-
tain decay and death.
In the human body these germs of
disease and death (called by scientists
Ptomaines), are usually the result of
imperfect digestion of food; the result
of indigestion or dyspepsia.
The stomach, from abuse, weakness,
does not promptly and thoroughly
digest the food. The result is a heavy,
sodden mass which ferments (the first
process of decay), poisoning the blood,
making it thin, weak, and lacking in
red corpuscles, poisoning the brain
causing headaches and pain in the eyes
Bad digestion irritates the heart
causing palpitation and finally bring-
ing on disease of this very important
organ.
Poor digestion poisons the kidneys,
causing Bright's disease and diabetes.
And this is so because every organ,
every nerve, depends upon the stomach
for nourishment and renewal,
weak digestion shows Itself not
only in loss of appetite and flesh, but in
nerves and muddy complexion.
great English scientist, Huxiey,
the best start in life is a sound
i' h. Weak stomachs fall to digesi
ij'iperl" because they lack th-?
;â¢ quantity of digestive acids
; nd hydrochloric) and pepto-
products; the mosi sensible
ly in all cases of indigestion is to
take after each meal one or two of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, because
the,y supply in a pleasant, harmless
form all the elements that weak stom-
achs lack.
ThÂ« regular use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will cure every form of stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach.
They lncr< ise flesh, insure pure blood,
strong nerves, a bright eye and clear
complexion, because all these result
only from wholesome food well
digested.
Nearly all druggists sell Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets at 50 cents full-sized
package or by mail by inclosing price
to Stuart Company, Marshall. Mich,,
but ask your druggist first.

M Jâ¢S U " 5 Days' Treatment
jL :>^^llL v . By Sealed Mail.
- ; >^^i|W NO C, 0. D. OR DEPOSIT SCHEME.
Every person who Is a sufferer from nervous
diseases should write the Yon Mohl Co., Cin-
cinnati, Ohio, at once, and accept their offer
of a five days' trial treatment free of charge.
This Is no C. O. D. or DEPOSIT scheme, but a
liberal proposition made to unfortunate suf-
ferers by this long-established concern, which
is the largest importer of specifics for nervous
and sexual diseases in the world.
The Yon Mohl Co. has the sole American
rights for Prof. Laborde's French preparation
of "Calthos." the only remedy known to ad-
vanced medical science that will positively
cure nervous debility. This remedy has for
years been used as a specific in the French
and German armies, and since its introduction
into the United States hat; cured many thous-
ands of sufferers, and the remarkable success of
the remedy in Europe has been repeated in this
country.
In order to place this wonderful treatment
in the hands of every person who suffers the
mental and physical anguish of sexual weak-
ness, the Yon Mohl Co. has decided to send a
free trial treatment to all Who write at once.
The remedy is sent by mall in a plain pack- I
age, and there is no publicity in receiving It or
taking it. Accompanying the medicine there
is a full treatise in plain language for you to
read. Take the medicine privately with per- ,
feet safety, and a sure cure is guaranteed.
Lost vitality creeps upon men unawares. Do i
not deceive yourself or remain In ignorance
while you are being dragged down by this in-
â idiotu disease. No matter what the cause may
be. whether early abuses, excesses or overwork :
and business cares, the results are the same â !
TO SHUT OFF
SINECURES IN
SANTA CLARA
Suits Aimed at the
Mackenzies.
HOW THE COUNTY IS FLEECED
TWO SOFT SNAPS OBTAINED BY
POLITICAL PULLS.
Validity of the Offices of County
Game Warden and Supervisor
of City Kindergartens
to Be Tested.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 4.â Suits will soon
be commenced in the Superior Court
to shut off part of the income which
members of the Mackenzie family de
rive from the county and city, and also
to retire two of their number to priv
ate life. The cases in question will
test the validity of the offices of Coun
ty Game Warden and Supervisor of
City Kindergartens. The former is
filled by John D. Mackenzie, Rea's lieu
tenant, who is trying to undermine his
"boss" that he himself may wield the
scepter and direct Santa Clara County
politics. Miss Belle Mackenzie looks af
ter the kindergartens. These are not
the only two of the Mackenzies who
are fattening at the public crib, for
Brother Andy Mackenzie is Police Com
missioner, and a sister is in the school
department.
The Game Wardenship costs the
county $1200 per year. The people of
late have been inquiring into the ben
efits they derive from such an office.
Mackenzie uses his office for political
purposes, and the county is benefited
in no way, as he devotes no time to
looking after the proper preservation of
game. Santa Clara is the only county
that has this extravagant office, which
has been declared unconstitutional in
half a dozen counties of the State.
Papers asking for an injunction, stop
ping the Auditor from allowing Mac
kenzie's claims, have been prepared
and will, it is said, be filed in a few
days. Mackenzie has enjoyed the
fruits of his office for about two years
and has about another year to serve.
His salary is $75 per month, and he
also has an allowance of $25 per month
for expenses.
Mackenzie has appointed about 100
Deputy Wardens in various parts of
the county, and these, with the Game
Warden, act as organizers for the Cal
ifornia Club. This latter organization
is where all the political schemes of
the gang are hatched, and from this
place Kea and Mackenzie direct their
heelers to do the dirty politics that has
characterized all elections held in the
county during past years.
There is no doubt as to the illegality
of the position of Supervisor of Kin
dergartens filled by Miss Mackenzie,
and in creating the same the Board of
Education was guilty of an unlawful
act. No such power is conferred upon
the Trustees, and, besides, the charter
makes no provision for the office. The
same question was decided several
years ago by the Supreme Court of
California in the case of James H.
Barry vs. W. S. Goad, on appeal from
San Francisco County.
Miss Mackenzie receives $75 salary
per month, and the place is considered
the greatest "snap" in the city. The
legality of the office will also be tested
shortly.

Uncertain What to Do With the Dere-
lict at Santa Cruz.
SANTA CRT'Z. Oct. 4.â D. H. Bibb, one
of the owners of the derelict raft, arrived
to-day. He says his company still owns
the raft and any person who purchases it
of others who claim it will be sued. Bibb
is undecided whether to tow the raft to
San Francisoo or land it nn the beach. It
is feared that if landed here the lumber
will be thrown on the market and a big
cut in prices made.

D'Aubigny to Become French Minis

PARIS, Oct. 4.â The Figaro states that
Count D'Aubigny, now French charge
d affaires at Munich, will replace M. Cam
bon as Minister to the United States, and
that M. Cambon will go to Madrid. These
changes, the paper says, were decided
upon at yesterday's cabinet council.
premature loss of strength and memory, emis-
sions impoteney. varicocple and shrunken
parts. This specific remedy will cure you at
any stage before epilepsy results, with ensuing
consumption ami insanity. "Calthos" goes di-
rectly to the seat of the trouble, no matter of
how long standing, and the patient feels the
benefit of the first day's treatment. In five
days the medicines sent free will make you
U-A like a new man.
The Yon Mohl Co. often receives the most
astonishing testimonials from persons who
have taken only five days' treatment. They
have thousands of testimonials from those who
have been permanently cured after having been
given up by doctors, misled and ruined in
health by disreputable medical schemers, and
when they had given up their last hope for
health and happiness. No sensible person will
permit his name to be used for a testimonial
as an admission that he had any of the dis-
eases for which the. preparation of "Calthos" is
a specific cure. Some irresponsible advertisers
are using "made-up" testimonials, but the Yon
Mohl Co. invariably declines to make public the
Dames or correspondence of any patients who
have been cured by "Calthos."
Five days' treatment will be placed in your
hands free of cost, and you are earnestly
urged for your own sake to send for it with-
out delay. Write to-day and send your ad-
dress. It is not necessary to give embarrass-
ing details of your symptoms. The book ac-
companying the five days' treatment will en-
able you to take the medicine in private and
treat yourself successfully at home. It costs
nothing to try this remedy. It may cost you a
great deal more to lPt this offer go by. Write

There was a clergyman in a Long Island village who suf- '
fered from dyspepsia to such an extent that it positively seemed
sometimes as though his doctrine was not sound. It was, however,
only a stomach trouble, and had nothing to do with the mind.
Being convinced of this, one of his parishioners, a lady, presented
him with a small quantity of Ripans Tabules and the relief he ex-
perienced was such that all the congregation 'noticed an improve- -
ment, and now, although his salary small, this clergyman and

there are many cases where what has been thought heresy was in
fact nothing more nor less than dyspepsia, and Ripans Tabules euro
dyspepsia. One gives relief.

"A MATTER OF BUSINESS."
EVIDENTLY the Bulletin is devoid of prin
ciple. Professing to be a Republican paper, it
is supporting the Democratic nominee lor
Mayor. This is done as a "matter of business."
There is reason for believing that a price was paid,
the surprising circumstance being not that the paper
would accept a price for its untrammeled opinion, but
that anybody should have been cajoled into paying
the price.
To emphasize its Republicanism, the Bulletin now
comes out in favor of Barclay Henley for District At
torney. Henley is on the Democratic ticket, the se
lection of the Mayor. The Canadian editor professes
to believe that Henley would be alert in bringing of
fenders to justice. Such an expression of belief can
rot be taken as sincere. The editor of the Bulletin
has himself been a gross offender. He deliberately
engineered a bunko scheme of which the business
men of this community were the victims. People who
do such things do not want an able prosecutor in
authority. Supposing Crothers had been ably prose
cuted. He would now have been wearing stripes, for
as to his guilt there was no question. He would not
row have been at liberty to sell himself, or even to of
fer himself for sale. Hence we may be pardoned for
doubting that his recommendation of Henley as a
man who would corral the rascals comes from the
heart. Crothers does not want to be corraled.
Two years apo the Bulletin asked $5000 for sup
porting the Republican ticket, which show? the brand
of its Republicanism. There is no reason to suppose
it has reformed. Indeed there is every rer.son for
thinking that it has once more been in the market.
and this time found a purchaser. With Crothers it is
ail a "matter of busiiv
Th|E FIRST BOOA\ERANG.
I"""" HE first boomerang of the campaign has made
its appearance. It was launched from the fusion
camp, traversed an irregular curve in the empty
air and returned promptly back upon the head of the
party that hurled it. It was of portentous form, and,
while the forward stroke was slight, there is reason
to believe the back action has had something of the
force of a knock-out blow.
The extraordinary document purported to be a cir
cular letter from the Republican campaign committee
giving instructions to the editors of the interior press
to make the fight against Maguire on the single tax
exclusively. "We suggest," says this artful circular,
"that you enter into no discussion of the single tax
itself, as the doctrine is not well understood, and its
advocates, having long studied it, are apt to have you
at a disadvantage. Besides, the fallacious theory is
very captivating to certain classes. Simply state all
the time that the single taxers* mean to put all the
taxes on the farmer?, and stay with that proposition.'
When the document was called to the attention of
Chairman McLatjghHn of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee he said: "It is as shameful n lie as has
yet been uttered by the Popo-Democratic party in
this campaign."' The language was no stronger than
the occasion justified, and yet it was hardly needed.
The document carries the marks of falseness on its
face.
So far from desiring to restrict' the campaign to the
single tax issue, the Republican orators and press
have repeatedly urged the importance of national is
sues in the campaign, and hays challenged Maguire
and his supporters again and again to revive their old
clamor for free silver and fiat money, free trade and
Bryanism, if they dared.
The boomerang is the invention of the Australian
savage, one of the lowest of the races of men, and it
is attractive to '/ersons of like intellectual caliber. I;
has frequently been adopted by men of low cunning
in American politics, but has never proved effective
against those whom they wished to injure. In al
most even' case the weapon has returned to strike
the men who threw it. Sometimes the return blow
has been long in coming, but in this instance it has
btcn prompt. The effect of the faked circular upon
the tricky schemers of the fusion camp will be noted
by the squeals that will go up for days to come.
There is a suspicion that Chaplain Mclntyre of the
Oregon is being court-martialed for having told the
truth. His pica that he was so full of quinine when
he spoke that he did not know what he was saying
ought to be sufficient to exculpate hi::- > satisfy
those who hnve been aggrieved.
While the Grand Jury is investigating school affairs i
it should not be forgotten that the members of the
School Board were chosen by Mr. Phelan. and that ;
Mr. Phelan is sensitive.
The Rev. Mr. Briggs mnst he in a state of <loubt
as to whether or not to indulge in self-congratula
tion. It is true that he was acquitted, but the effect I
w?s not to supply him with a halo.
THE "NON-PARTISAN" FfIRCE.
ALL the respectable Republican citizens who, as
members of Deacon Fitch's Non-Partisan
convention, are being used to further the
schemes of the Democratic politicians who are now
running that so-called "'party," should withdraw im
mediately and save their reputations. The Non-
Partisan convention is nothing more or less than a
Democratic sideshow. Mayor Phelan's brother-in
law, assisted by Deacon Fitch (who ought to be in
better business), have united to secure practically all
the indorsements for the former's job-chasers.
There is no question about this. The record already
made up proves it.
The Non-Partisans nominated Phelan for Mayor
befo.e any other candidate had been named. They
have indorsed Phelan's candidates for Sheriff, County
Clerk, Tax Collector, District Attorney and Re
corder, thus giving him in the ev^nt of success the
patronage of the municipal government and control
of the Board of Election Commissioners for next
year's campaign. Dr. Dodge was slated for Asses
sor, but by some strange circumstance this part of
the bargain between the Non-Partisans and Phelan
has fallen through. The newspaper organ of the con
spiracy, however, has been attacking Siebe ever
since he received the indorsement of the convention,
and the Phelanites are working hard to have him
taken down. They may yet succeed in doing so.
All this makes it plain that the Non-Partisans are a
Democratic sideshow. As a moral reform party
their indorsement is. therefore, valueless. We advise
Republican candidates to shun them. They have
united with Phelan in an attempt to capture the city
offices, and the legs of the Republican members of
the convention are being pulled by the job-chasing
Democrats who controlled the Committee of One
Hundred.
On the whole the spectacle is decidedly humiliating.
Heretofore an indorsement by Deacon Fitch's party
has constituted a sort of certificate of character. Of
itself it did not bring many votes, but it strength
ened a candidate with his party and helped his cam
paign among respectable people. But in its present
aspect non-partisanism is a farce. As a Democratic
sideshowâ the instrument of ' Sullivan, McNab and
Phetan for getting the officesâ it is a howling fraud.
It can neither bring votes to a candidate nor
strengthen him morally with the people. All its in
dorsement can do is to prove that an aspirant for
office enjoys the favor of Boss Phelan and his ring
of patronage grubbers.
Probably it is useless to advise Mr. Fitch to with
draw from the Non-Partisan convention, since he ap
pears to have enli-ted for the war with Boss Phelan;
but, nevertheless, we feel constrained to offer him 1
word of advice.
Mr. Fitch's avowed purpose in practicing politics
is to purify the government. Like Brutus, his as
pirations are elevated and elevating, and however
base the motives of his lieutenants, he is not believed
to share in them. He thinks Phelan is sincere and
McNab honest. But how will it be, when, like
Brutus, he is finally compelled to run upon his own
sword? Pie ought to know that his leg is being pulled
by the Democratic patronage brokers, and that as
soon as they get their men in office they will throw
him and his moral reform ideas overboard. If Dea
con Fitch cares anything for the reputation he has
heretofore enjoyed as a sincere and intelligent man.
he should adjourn the Non-Partisan convention
without delay. If he keep on much longer the town
will have to provide him with a fool's cap and a stool.
AMERICAN ART COLLECTIONS.
ALBERT A. MUNGER, a citizen of Chicago,
has recently presented to the Art Institute of
that city a collection of sixty-three paintings
valued at about $300,000. The collection includes
works by such masters as Corot, Gerome, Meisso
nier, Munkacsy and Bougereau. It is a gift with
which Chicago is justly delighted, and of which other
cities in that section of the Union are more or less
envious.
The Cleveland Leader maintains that the reason
Chicago has been so fortunate of late in receiving
gifts of art treasures is because she has erected a
stately and beautiful building in which to house them.
There is much reason to support the conclusion. A
magnificent edifice never fails to impress the minds of
those who live near it, and to awaken an interest in
the object to which the building is devoted. Out of
that interest there invariably proceeds a desire to aid
in the attainment of the object, and the structure thus
serves not only as a storehouse of art, or science, or
learning, but as an incentive toward contributions to
ifs treasures.
In every part of the United States where massive
and durable art galleries have been erected the ac
cumulation of artistic masterpieces has gone forward
at a rapid rate. Our advance in all lines of develop
ment has been so great that we have hardly noted
the extent to which we have progressed in that par
ticular branch of culture. The advance has been ob
served in Europe, however, for American buyers
have now become sharp competitors in the art mar
kets of the Old World, and it has been forcibly im
pressed upon European collectors that the United
States is the greatest picture purchasing nation on the
globe.
A writer in the Nineteenth Century, in discussing
the growth of American art galleries, says "the
United States is on the way to becorfie the Louvre
of the nations," and adds: "From year to year its
public galleries have been enriched with masterpieces
of ;ill tl-c modern schools; and by purchase, bequest
or gift, many valuable and some great pictures by the
older Italian, Flemish and Spanish master? have been
added to the already imposing store of national art
wealth. In New York pre-eminently, but also in Bos
ton, Washington, Philadelphia, and in other large
cities, from New Orleans in the South to Chicago in
the North, and from Baltimore in the East to San
Frnnciseo in the West, there is now so numerous
and, in the main, so distinguished a congregation of
pictures, of all schools and periods, that the day is
not only at hand, but has arrived, when the native
student of art no longer needs to go abroad in order
to lenrn the tidal reach and high-water mark in this
or that nation's achievement, in this or that school's
accomplishment, in this or that individual painter's
work."
Along with this increase in our stores of art treas
ures there comes of course an increased development
of native artistic talent. If our attainments in art are
now notable mainly for what we draw from Europe.
it will not be long before they will be renowned for
what is produced at home. Every art gallery is an
incentive to art culture and a school for artists.
America is destined to become something more than
"the Louvre of the nations." She is to be a fruitful
mother of master artiÂ«tr-. and her art schools are to
be as renowned as her galleries.
Senator Pfeffcr of Kansas has been accused of
abandoning ' Populism, but his whiskers are # still in
evidence. Still, it is hard to cling to .1 thing which
has disappeared. The most Pfcffer can reasonably be
expected to do is to cherish the memory of the de
parted.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1898.
STAMPING OUT THE YELLOW LIES.
GENERAL SHAFTER is the latest official who
has been moved by a just indignation to de
nounce the falsehoods circulated by the yellow
press and a considerable number of fusion dema
gogues against the administration for an alleged in
efficiency in the conduct of the war. These attacks
the General characterizes as "simply outrageous," and
a. c lies.
There has been comparatively little of that kind of
campaign abuse in circulation on this coast, the yel
low Hearst organ being the only serious offender,
but in the Eastern States it appeared at one time as
if the whole Democratic campaign was going to be
made out of that material.
So numerous were the scandals, and so serious had
the lying become, that Attorney General Griggs, in
an address before the Republican convention of New
Jersey, devoted no little attention to it. After re
ferring to the authors of the falsehoods as "hovering
like buzzards over the battle-fields and hospitals and
graveyards, looking only for the misery and suffer
ing and death which are inevitable in war," he said:
"Surely the Democratic party has not been reduced
so low in its supply of proper subjects for political
discussion as to need to rely upon yellow fever and
yellow literature."
The action of the President in appointing a com
mittee of men of national repute for fairness and in
tegrity to investigate the charges of the yellow jour
nals has had the effect of silencing a great many of
them. The announcement that the committee would
summon the authors of the charges to give evidence
put them in an embarrassing position. Having no
proofs of their assertions to offer, they found it ad
visable to hush up before the summons came.
The whole course of the yellow journals and yellow
campaigners on this matter has, however, been too
disgraceful for the public to overlook and forget it,
even though the slanderers are for the time reduced
to silence. The people know that gross wrongs have
been inflicted upon the administration and the officers
of the army, and a day of reckoning \till come when
they will settle with the authors.
For the present, however, the country will turn
willingly from that vile record of falsehood and spite
to the consideration of the great issues awaiting so
lution. The voters will take the advice given by Gen
eral Griggs in closing his address: "Lift up your
eyes to the heights where glory is crowned. The
genius of American liberty points to a future preg
nant with prodigious good to all mankind; to fresh
fields for the extension of American trade and com
merce: new openings for the investment of Ameri
can capital; wider scope for the active energies of
American young men; to more frequent glimpses of
the American flag for voyager? over the ocep.ns: mer
chant shipping multiplied manifold in the harbors of
the world; with a navy large enough and. strong
enough to enforce our just demands and the rights of
American citizens as promptly and as efficiently
ar, Devvey enforced the views of the Government in
Manila Bay."
REPORTS from China concerning the death of
the Emperor are conflicting, but out of the very
conflict conies proof that the crisis in the em
pire has reached an acute stage and is likely to result
in disturbances that will endanger the property and
the lives of all foreigners residing there. It is there
fore gratifying that the President has promptly or
dered Admiral Dewey to dispatch the Baltimore to
the Chinese coast at once for the protection of Amer
ican interests.
The riots in the larger cities of the empire and the
rumor that the death of the Emperor was caused by
assassination reveal something of the real conditions
of the Chinese situation, and aid in an understanding
of the difficulties that have confronted the Dowager
Empress, Li Hung Chang and other officials in deal
ing with the issues arising from the conflict of Jap
anese and European aggression on the one side and
Chinese stagnation and superstition on the other.
The young Emperor appears to have been a liberal
minded youth with aspirations to accomplish among
his people reforms on the broadest scale. It was his
desire to enlighten the ignorance of the Chinese by
the introduction of European sciences as well as in
dustrial arts among them, and in the pursuit of this
ambition he went so far as to require aspirants for
official positions to pass examinations and write
papers on chemistry instead of on the Chinese classics
as of old.
Had the empire been victorious in the war with
Japan, had it been free from European aggression,
such radical measures as these would even under such
circumstances have aroused antagonism. Coming as
they did at a time when the people were exasperated
by defeat and roused to rage by the encroachments of
France, Germany, Great Britain and Russia, they
naturally appeared to the populace and the upholders
of the old faith as a betrayal of the nation- by its ruler.
It is therefore not to be wondered at that in their
barbarism they have resorted to riots and to assassin
ation.
With such a seething mass of discontent around
them the Dowager Empress and her advisers from Li
Hung Chang down have had a harder task to per
form than any other rulers of the time. It is clear
rhat an extensive civil disturbance in China will hasten
the disruption of the empire. It is essential to the
preservation of peace that the superstitions of the
people shall not be too much disturbed, that re
forms shall go slowly. It is at the same time neces
sary to appease the greed of Europe for trade. Con
cessions have had to be made in turn to each of the
great commercial powers. Thus the administration at
Peking has found itself in a dilemma to escape from
which would have taxed the brains of the greatest
statesmen that ever lived even in the most enlight
ened nations.
The end seems at hand. The young Emperor, even
if the reports of his death be unfounded, is politically
dead. The Dowager Empress and Chang are grow
ing old. The menace of civil war is perceived in
every province of the empire. The fleets of the great
nations are hastening from the seven seas and gath
ering around the Chinese coast awaiting the inevit
able coming of the time when each will seize what it
can. It will be something very like a mirr.cle that
will keep old China intact until the close of the cen
tury.
For several years a number of intelligent nations
have bent their energies to the extinction of the seal
herd. Pcrsevcrence wili accomplish much, and suc
cess seems near at hand.
T. Carl Spelling announces that he i; still in the
fight for Congress. Aside from the word of the gen
tleman there is scant evidence pointing to this con
clusion.
General Garcia is getting better pay from Uncle
Sam than he ever got from Cuba, and perhaps the
experience will tend to soothe his savage breast.
It may be said for the football season that it has
been opened this year V'ith a gratifyingly small num
ber of funerals.
THE CRISIS IN CHINA.
IN DEFENSE
OF MAGUIRE.
Editor Call: In your editorial head
ed "What Maguire Stands For," in The
Call of Sunday, September 18, you say,
among other things, that he "stood up
for anarchy and anarchists in Con
gress, declaring them to be the dem
ocrats of Europe and worthy to be wel
comed as immigrants to the United
States," and that he "is for the confis
cation of land by the single tax."
Presuming that space in ihe Call,
and not space in the circumambient at
mosphere, is what is- meant by the last
paragraph but one of the article re
ferred to, I ask, as one of those who
regard Judge Maguire not alone as my
friend but the friend of all just men.
that you give space to the opinion that
both the above quoted propositions are
not strictly within the pale of truth.
It is, of course, well known that in
his speech in Congress on the immi
gration bill Judge Maguire opposed its
passage. He did so on broadly liberal
grounds of American principle, and
during his speech used the following
language:
"Who are the Nihlists? They are
the democrats of Russia who are strug
gling against almost hopeless odds to
establish the natural and inalienable
rights of m^n in that country. * *
"Who are the anarchists of Sapin?
They are the republicans of that coun
try, seeking to establish the principle
of popular sovereignty as against the
unnatural privilege of governing now
enjoyed by a single family.
"Who are the socialists of Germany?
They are the opponents of monarchical
government and special privilegeâ the
advocates of the equal rights of man.
I believe their schemes of social re
generation to be impracticable and mid
taken, but their purpose is right and
their cause should be sacred to every
lover of liberty and justice.
"I trust the time will never come
when men who struggle for liberty and
justice against tyranny and oppression
will be denied asylum in the 'land of
the free heart's hope and home.'
"The anarchists and socialists who
are dangerous to the free institutions
of this country are not those who are
contending against monarchical tyran
ny in Europe, but, rather, those of our
own citizenship, who, by powerful com
binations of wealth and special privi
lege, are overriding and evading our
laws and corrupting those who make
and administer them. These are the
classes against whose serious menace
to free institutions our legislation
should be directed."
Every syllable of that speech must
be indorsed by enlightened citizens who
believe in the great democratic princi
ple of political equality and freedom,
whose minds are not biased by race or
class prejudice.
Since beginning this letter, by the
merest chance, there has come to my
hand a small pamphlet, entitled "Law
and Authority." by Pierre Krapotkine,
which, I Judge, after a hasty perusal
of its pages, is an anarchist tract in
tended to propagate ideas antagonistic
to established notions of delegated or
usurped human authority to enforce
laws enacted by delegated representa
tives, and the substitution therefor of
natural, divine law without the inter
mediary of human legislative enact
ment. Judicial decree or penalty. This,
I take it, would be anarchyâ the repeal
of man's laws and the acceptance of
Ood's laws. A very pretty speculative
theory, but as impossible of execution,
as humanity is constituted, as is the
d-irtrine of universal Christianity. Th.c
author is evidently a man of more than
average intellectual ability, of an ana
lytical and philosophical turn of mind,
for the easay contains much close, log
ical reasoning and a great deal of
truth, and is written in faultless Eng
lish. There is nothing positively dan
gerous in its pages, it teaches no viol
ence, no murder, no blood-letting, no
revolution, in the ordinary meaning of
the term, and no liberal-minded, intel
ligent person would advocate the death
or banishment of its author, although
he teaches contempt for existing
forms of law and authority and shows,
or attempts to show, wherein they are
contemptible.
It is to such men Judge Maguire had
reference in his speech, and not to the
poverty-crazed wretches like the slayer
of the late Empress of Austria. I
myself haye â all who are mentally
qualified to formulate optnions doubt
less haye â a contempt for certain laws
and customs which ignorance, tradition
and superstition have fastened upon
us, which we would overthrow If possi
ble, and which, through political par
ties, we are attempting to repeal, to
overthrow, to abolish. We may be
said, then, to be anarchists to that ex
tent, and dangerous to human institu
tions because we want to abolish the
established order.
No?
Well, then, anarchismâ and I am not
defending it or pleading its cause â
merely stating the truth about It as I
see it â anarchism is no more a menace
to civilization than anj r other line of
philosophical reasoning, and believers
in its theories ar% no more dangerous
than believers in other schools of
thought until brooding over real or fan
cied wrongs their minds give way and
succumb to the strain which their in
herent weakness la powerless to resist.
Then they become identical with the
crazy Republican, Democrat or Popu
list who runs amuck and in a fit of
jealous rage or fanatical frenz^ mur
ders an unfaithful mistress or wife, a
Lincoln or a Garfleld.
As Judge Maguire has pointed out on
innumerable occasions, it is industrial
oppression, inequality and special priv
ilege which is at the root and founda
ton of all political discontent among
the poorer classes, and it is tliat which
is the underlying cause of crack
brained anarchistic and nihilistic at
tempts at murder and destruction.
This brings me down to th<? consider
ation of the other proposition, viÂ«:
That Judge Maguire is for "the confis
cation of land by the sintrle tax." To
this charge it is only necessary to re
ply that the single tax will have no
greater tendency to confiscate land
than has the present system. It will
confiscate the monopoly value of land
and compensate society fur the service
which it renders to land users by giving
value to land wlirse exclusive pn<;?r-s
sion and use is a spec!*] privilege en
joyed only by the user, and without
the presence of which (society) the
value of the Fp^cial privilege dimin
ishes in direct ratio as the population
diminishes, and increases in like ratio
with the increase of population.
Tt is a proposition that must be ad
mitted by all fair-minded men that the
enrth was created not for the exclusive
use of a few favored individuals, but
for the whole human race. This being
the case, the exclusive possession of
any given location which, by reason of
itr site Is more valuable than another,
is a special privilege? and should be
paid for as such by him v.ho enjoys it.
Since society plvea to land all the
value that attaches to it. those who
enjoy the'privllege of its exclusive use
or monopoly shov.ld. in common Justice
and equity. corop rt r>r-itr> society for the
monopoly value Which Us prosencp con
fers upon the land. Thjs In its es
sence is the single tax. and there Is
j nowhere in the proposition anything
but equity involved. "Webster defines
confiscation as "The act of condemning
as forfeited, and adjudging to the pub
lic treasury." Since society would take
away nothine: but what it gives there
; can be no confiscation of land under
: the single tax. hut tenure would be as
secure and undisturbed ns it is at pres
ent.
"What Judge Mapuire stands for Is
i broad-minded- liberalism, freedom of
â  thought and action, the reward of ser
| vice and abolition of â  ; privilege â the
j highest ideals of the most exalted â¢ hu
i man prerogativesâ all thr.t Paine, and
Jefferson, and Franklin, and Lincoln
and Henry George stood for In the on
ward march of human progress.
A keen appreciation of the spirit or
fairness exhibited by The Call in ac
cording both sides of a controversy a
hearing: in its columns prompts me to
thank it in advance for the considera
tion which I am sure it will show by
giving: space to these remarks. Re

And the roar of t c cloven dykeâ
Only the arm of the Lord upheaved, and
The sword of the Lord to strike.
Said the Sea, "O Nederland! alone.
You battle against the stars.
For Brill's hoarse cry and Alkmaar s
groan
I storm at your stubborn bars.
In Heiliger Lee your Rachels weep,
In Leyden your children die;â
Death unto Life, Deep unto Deep!
And my tides leap at the cry.
Set wide your to my hosts, and
aound yeur pealing trumpets high!'
"Oranje Boven!"â Fate is mute,
And the Silent soul is lord.
"Oranje Boven!" â Trump and lute
Wait on the grim, dumb sword.
When the brand is cold, and the blade Is
rust,
And the gyve and the rack are shows.
When the bones of the Brave enrich th*
dust
Where a Leyden garden grows â
Then the organ swell 0/ the Sea shall tell
how Nederland uprose.
On Yssel's flanks, with thrifty sails,
The windmills churn the air,
Where erst a Viking's galley rails
Their bossed shields laid bare
I dream that the high-beaked triremes
sweep
A path for the hordes of Rome,
As I rock in a fisher's boat, asleep,
In the lee of a hedger's horne â
While the bells are chiming a psalm of
Rest from storied tower and dome.
And Thou, O fairest flower of Peace,
Child of a happy star!
Glories, and guerdons of increase
Wreathe thy ancestral Lar.
White Righteousness In thine array,
And on thy shield Renown,
Honor shall celebrate thy day,
And Law salute thy crown,
While grass shall grow and water flow,
and the ships sail up and down.

COD FISHâ C. T. M., Centerville. Placer
County, Cal. Cod fish is the name by
which the Gadus Morrhua is commonly
known. Cod is the name given to the
fish that live on a rocky bottom. Rock
cod and red cod are names given to the
common cod. The name rock cod applied
along the Pacific Coast to chiroidS and to
sebastichlhys and then even transferred
to serranus comes from an affiliation of
their affinity to ophiodon and not from
any supposed resemblance to the true cod
fish. Rock cod is misapplied in San Fran
cisco to a sebastine fish (Sebastichlhya
flavidus), and about Puget Sound to a
chiroid fish (Hexagrammus decgrammus).
The Gadhus Morrhua belongs to the im
portant family of malaccopterous fishes
known as Gadidae. To this family belong
the cod, ling, hakedorse. haddock, whit
ing, coalfish. burbot and others. As to
the matter in controversy, the fish served
up was cod, but not codfish as that term
is applied to the Gadhus 7>Torrhua.

SANTA ROSA, Oct. 4.â The fiend who
made such a desperate attempt to
wreck . icific train a week
lay near Glen Ellen has
been arrested and now secure
behind prison bars. Ever since the ac
cident the authorities have been en
gaged in an active search for the crim
inal, but their efforts were nut success
ful untii to-night, when he was located
in Vallejo and soon after placed under
arrest. The prisoner made a full con-
fession and told without reserve the
story of his attempt to derail the train
and hurl the passengers and crew to
destruction. He gives his name as Hugh
Griffin and says hid mother resides near
Sebastopol. lie was arrested at Vullejo
this afternoon by Constable Blesslng
â : that piace.
When charged with the crime the
prisoner broke down completely and
Bald the motive which prompted him to
the desperate deed was one of revengp.
On the U p trip Conductor Jeff Gage had
put him off, as he was attempting to
Bteal his passage to El Verano, and to
get even h<_- broke open the switch,
placed a stone between '1> 'â  rails to pre
vent its springing backlto correct po
sition and then forced the indicator
around In such, a way as to show every
thing was all right.
The train on its return trip, coming
around a curve, at the rate of twenty
five miles an hour, dashed into the open

ing there, derailing two passenger
coaches and overturning the engine,

wreck, watching the result of his fiend
ish work.
The prisoner is only a little over 21
years of age. Since Last Wednesday h â 
has been confined in th" Vallejo Jail
on a charge of vagrancy and it was
through confiding his story to a fellow
prisoner, who informed the officers of
what had been told him, that the loca
tion of the criminal and his arrest upon
the last charge was accomplished.

THE VERDICT ON THE
MYSTERY WAS SUICIDE
CORONER'S JURY INVESTIGATES
BERLIN'S DEATH.
Police Are Working on the Theory
of Murder â Trying to Find the
Woman in the Case.
The detective force has not as yet suc
ceeded in finding any clew that will help
in the unraveling of the mystery that sur
rounds the death of Gus Berlin, whose
dead body was found on Sunday night
hanging to the cioset door of his bed
room at US Eleventh street.
Although the Coroner's Jury yesterday
rendered a verdict of suicide, Detective
SiLvey, who was detailed upon the case,
has been unable to discover any motive
for such an act.
The condition of the body when found
indicated that he came to his death some
time on Saturday evening. Ke was seen
by his landlady on that evening and dur
ing the day had spent some time with
srouÃ friends who had worked with
In Alaska for the Alaska Packing
elation. All of these people say posi
tively that he* was in his usual good
La and In no degree in liquor.
The allegation that Berlin took his lire
i ecause or the refusal by Miss Hannah
Nf.-s. of 16<M Mission, of his offer of mar
. is exploded by that lady's statc
tnent.
She said yesterday: "I have known Gus
!:< rlin for seven or eight years and In that
time he has made me many presents, but
he has never once made me a direct offer
of marriage. We were good friends al
ways: i did his sewing for him and little
things like that, but he never asked rm;
to marry him. He did not come to visit
-me so often as the neighbors say. The
last time I saw him was on Monday, a
week before he met his death."
No clear story is to be had from Mrs.
Hart, Berlin's landlady. The statements
that she makes of the affair are contra
dicted by her daughter, and vice versa.
They unite, however, in saying that Ber
.in never came in under the influence of
Minor and was seldom in low spirits
'.bey also say that though they were in
'.â¢ ir room, which is separated from that
â occupied by Berlin, all of Saturday even
ing 1 , they heard, no noise such as would
necessarily been made by tho dead
wore he dying from strangulation
Detective Silvey will continue his In
vestigation to-day; he hopes to discover
the woman to whom Berlin administered
o Bevere a beating on the night of Sep
tember 17.

THE SA^T FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1898.
POPULISTS
NOMINATE
REPUBLICANS
Go Over to the Enemy
for Candidates.
ANGRY AT PHELAN'S METHODS
EXFECTED RECOGNITION AT
THE HANDS OF THE BOSS.
Were Not Accorded a Place on the
Municipal Ticket by the Dem
ocratic Committee of
One Hundred.
The 3elegat.es to tho Populist Pnrty Mv- i
nicipal Convention, representing the Gil- j
-Klnne-Grlswold fusion ring: of the
party, met last night in Scottish Hall, j
L.arkin street, to continue the nomina- j
tlon of men for various municipal of- i
fiees.
At the Sacramento convention these
people fused with the Democrats and Sll
ver Republicans and there was a sub- j
division of offices, the Democrats carry
ing: off the major portion. The fusion
Populists thought that it was not fusion
alone on the State ticket, but that they
would also be recognized in the city. The
opposite was the case. They were not
consulted by Boss Phelan and "Whisper-
ing" Gavin McNab, the manipulators cf
the committee of one hundred i>>li chas
ers. The Populists had no place on the
Democratic ticket. The fusionists raised
a storm of disapproval which assumed
form last night In the nomination of two
Republicans on their ticket.
The men selected for preferment were
Martin P. Fragley, Republican candidate
for Superintendent of Streets, an.l T. J.
Graham, candidate for Police Judg3. The
total number of their nominations dur
ing the evening were six. the remÂ«ininr
ones being: James D. Pheiar. Demo
cratic candidate for Mayor; i 2. L. Fitz
gerald, Democratic candidate for Public
Administrator; E. P. Moga-i, Democratic j
candidate for Police Judge, and Horace
\V. Philbrook. The latter Is a candidate
for Superior Judge and has received no
other nomination.
After these names had been 'balloted
upon the following wore placed before
the convention to be voted jposi at a sub
sequent meeting: For Po!iC9 Judge, C.
A. Low; for Justice of Peace, Juhn A.
Carroll: Supervisor Sixth Ward, John
Lackmann; Seventh Ward, Dr. Kearney;
Tenth "Ward. Jeremiah Deasy; Eleventh
Wa~d, Dr. C. A. Clinton; Twelfth Ward,
Edwarc Aigeltinger; for Sur/ovir, Bcr
nar.l Blenfield; for Ooran^r, Dr. C\ C.
O'Don ell. The nominariorn for none of
th<. Â« offices were closed, as many can
didates tre expected to enter tl'.o usis
The meeting was called to order by tho
chairman. Dr. J. H. Miller. After the
minutes of the previous meeting were
read the report of the committee on in
vestigation of candidates was presented
by Chairman A. B. Kinne. The remain
der of tiic- committee is made up of
George D. Gillesple, J. W. Reay, Henry
Hupport and P. J. Pye. The report waÃ
to the effect that some thirty candidates
for office, representing both the Republi
can and the Democratic parties, had ap
peared before the committee and re
quested that their names be submitted to
the convention for nomination. The com
mittee reported that a notice had been
mailed to every candidate for office, noti
fying them that the Populists were ready
to hear their claims for the various of
fices. Many have already qualified, while
oihers visited the committee without do
ing so. Some had not received their no
tices.
Nominations were then declared in or
der, and Delegate Gillespie named J. D.
Phelan for Mayor. This was made unani
mous.
They were not prepared to nominate for
a number of offices, so they at once
jumped to the office of Superintendent of
Streets. The names of M. F. Fragley and
R. I. Doolan were both placed before the
convention. Fragley (Republican) received
122 votes, Doolan (Democrat) 22.
For Public Administrator K. L. Fitx
gerald received 138 votes and J. A. Drink
house 6.
H. W. Philbrook was nominated for
Superior Judge by acclamation on the
ground that he was a straight out Popu
list.
E. P. Mogan and T. J. Graham were
nominated for Police Judges by acclama
tion. Both were present and were escort
ed to the platform. Mr. Mopran said he
was in sympathy with the Populists. He
was glad of the coalition of Populists and
Democrats and predicted success for the
combination.
A number of candidates mentioned in
the foregoing were then placed before the
convention for future nomination. The
delegates will hold their meeting to-night
in Washington Hall, 35 Eddy street.
Those in control of the convention had
it in excellent work.ng order. Gillespie
and Kinne were on tneir feet continually
to head oft any effort at upsetting the
programme. The delegates fmm the
Thirty-seventh District were the only re
fractory ones in evidence. The trouble
commenced when a Mr. Mortality took
the floor. The question was raised that
he was not a delegate and had no voice
in the proceedings. His associates said
he took Delegate Morten's place. After a
short dispute the question of seating him
was referred to the committee on cre
bater on a delegate claimed that they
were railroading the work t .. rough, that
they were not acting aa a deliberative

NATIVE DAUGHTERS' HOME.
It Will Be Established by the Board
of Relief to Help Beyond What
Subordinate Parlors Can.
At the last held session of tho Grand
Parlor of the Native Daughters of the
Golden West it was resolved to estab
lish a Native Daughters' Home, to be
conducted by a board of relief to be com
posed of fifteen past grand presidents
and prominent members of the order.
The board Is to have for its object the
caring for the sick and destitute of the
order beyond what is done by the sub
ordinate parlors. The proposition at this
time Is to secure a suitable place in this
city In which a home can be established,
but as yet the matter Is in the prelimin
ary stages, as the committees of the
board are looking for a sufficient amount
of funds to warant thtm in opening
such a home and maintaining it for one
year. Already a number of physicians,
gentlemen and ladies of both schools,
have offered their services free to the
horn" and Alta Parlor, as a starter, on
motion of Grand Trustee Miss E. D.
Keith donated $100 to the board, and
Oro Fino Parlor No. 0 will to-morrow
night give a ball in Native Sons' Hall
for the benefit of the board. It is expect
it all the parlors will either make a
n â : 'â¢ v contribution or devise some enter
tainment to raise money for the new ad
junct of ihe order, and that It will not
be long before the board will open its

A GOLD WATCH INCIDENT
ORATORS WHO REFERRED TO
MAGUIRE'S POPULARITY.
After Disposing of the Railroad, War
and Bosses, They Fall Back
on the "Little Giant's"
Personality.
Democrats and adherents of other par
ties met in Metropolitan Temple last
evening seeking enlightenment on politi
cal tÃÃuea of the day. They didn't find
that they sought, but were impressed
with the fact that during the period of
his public life James G. Maguire has been
antagonistic to railroad interests, also
that the "Little Giant" was presented,
several years ago, with a gold watch and
chain, evidence of the gratitude of certain
litigants who had profited by a decision
rendered by the Democratic stanuanl
bearer when he was on the bench. In
consequence of the nature of the enlight
enmt lit received the "adherents of other
parties" went away unconvinced of the
merits of Democracy, and as the Demo
crats were convinced before they sought
enlightenment mutters stood about even
at the close of the meetine.
The lirst speaker of the evening was
Charles Wesley Reed. Although he failed
to electrify the audience, his address had
the effect of stimulating the anticipation
of the gathering, which had hopes of bel
ter things to come, in part he said:
"We are here to-night to advocate the
principles of Democracy. The Demo
cratic party is pledged to an economic
administration, which is an important i
feature of this campaign. The rank and |
file are compelled to pay the taxes to j
support the Government. The difficulty I
is that this responsibility does not rest at j
the present time equally on the shoulders J
of the rich and the poor. As the puor are
la the majority we should in consequence !
have an economic administration. When
we investigate the extravagance at pres- .
ent existing we cannot but help view the i
debased influence of bossism, and we now I
find the Democratic party wrestling with '
this problem. Any one can see the Re
publican party fathering tins institution '
i which is directed toward crushing the !
j greater institutions of our country. The :
i watchword of Democracy for this year ,
: is in consequence of this abuse 'economy
: and freedom from bossism.' The greatest
form of this evil is the rahroad. If the
; railroad wants Gage or Maguire it is said
i that it can have either one it wants. I ;
1 ask you. dops it want Maguire? The nom
i ination of Gage was not the work of the
. Republican convention, but the work of
its rulers, ar.d who are they? It must be
conceded that there are some leaders in
the Democratic party, but their influence i
is directed solely toward the furtherance
of honest principles and the nomination
of an honest ticket. They have the in
terests of the people at heart."
Reed then pave wav to J. J. Barrett.
Mr. Karrett euli.gized the standard-bearer
of the Democrats at length and won the
applause of the Democrats by character
izing Maguire as "the acknowledged !
chief of the anti-railroad forces." From
the railroad issue Mr. Barrett then drift
ed tn the great popularity of the Demo
cratic nominee for Governor, and in sub
stantiation of this statement referred to
the gold watch and chain presentation,
the gift of the jubilant litigants. Then
the war was touched upon by the
speaker.
"The Republican party has taken upon
itself all the glory of thp war." ho said,
"but that great strife for human liberty
was sustained and won by the valor of
the whole American people. Its purpose
appealed to no party prejudice and no
party prejudice was appealed to. In thr
deliberations preceding thf war the Dem
ocratic party contributed statesmen as
capable as those of the Republican party.
Wnon the issues passed from the halls
of the statesmen and on to the fields of
battle were thore no Democrats follow
ing the flag to victory? Call the roll.
When the gallant First returns thorp will
dp one Democratic hero we can name
without the roll, Colonel James F.
Smith."
The speakpr disposed of the war. rail
road and MagUire s personality, and RtP
phen B. Howard, a Silver Republican of
Minnpsota, was introduced. Mr. How
ard Is an ardont follower of Bryanism
and, although thp issues of the local cam
paign are at variance with the last na
tional fight, he opened his address by
stating that it was his belief that if the
Democratic party adhprod to the Chi
cago platform, under the leadership of
the great commander of Nebraska, the
people will rally to its sunport as they
did to tho doctrines of Thomas Jefferson
and Andre.w Jackson.
"Jefferson throttled thp bank monop
oly." he said. "We all know thp doc
trfnre of Andrew Jnr-kson. Lincoln
throttled the monopoly of human slavery
and this platform will throttle the gold
standard, the stock in trade of the vul
tures of Wall strppt. The silver ques
tion I will not refer to. It la unneces

that even the Republican party admits
is an issue. It is one to which we can
not too often refer. We have just con
cluded a foreign war. The victories we I
have gained upon the field of battle
quicken the blood of a., true Americans.
In this campaign the Republican party
holds that it is the only patriotic party
and alone sustained the war. They con
tend uiat to cast a vote for the Demo
cratic party was to cast a vote in con- '
demnation of the policy pursued during
the war. There were no political issues
in the war. When upon the field of bat
tle the Republican toucheu with his el
bow on the right a Democrat, on the left I
i a Populist. Ihey say we refused to vote
for revenue to sustain the war. It is
false, but we did refuse to vote for reve
nue to sustain the bondholders. A par
allel can easily be drawn between the
wny we would have handled the war and
the way it was handled by the present
administration. The Republican plan was
to obtain revenue through levying a tax
on the small business community. In
this way part was to be raised and the
rest by selling bonds to the bond syndi
1 cate. What was our plan? The Demo
crats voted against t,..s plan. They
agreed that part should be raised by
taxing the producing masses, but they
i demanded that the corporations of the
j country should contribute to the glorious
cause. \\ as there anything wrong in
tin's? We vcted for an income tax to
sustain the war. The treasury has $42,
000,000 worth of silver lying idle in the
vaults. We a.-k. â¢<! that it be coined and
were branded as anarchists. Why? Be
cause, when it was in circulation the
banks reaped no revenue from it. Then
we advocated the issuance of $150,000,000
in greenbacks. This; was worse than
anarchism. Why? Because greenbacks '
draw no interest for bunkers, and, fur
thermore, they cannot lie controlled. As
the matter stands to-day the American
people have sudd led upon them $200,000 000
in bonds, on which they must pay the in-
I terest and redeem. What are we going !
Ito do? But one thing. Put the banks
out of the governing business. As such
has not been done we now have instead
of the party of Lincoln the party of
Rothschilds."
Reel B. Terry was next called upon to
speak, and as his effort deviated from the
w< arisome course pursued by other speak
ers, he gained the friendship of his au
dience, which demanded that he continue
when he was about to conclude his ad
dress. Air. Terry coniined himself to a
criticism of candidates and speakers of the
i Repu. xiran party, and naturally gained '
: the sympathy of the Democratic au
dience, which had tired of listening to the
praise heaped on Democratic candidates,
liut once did he deviate from the path, '
I and then he again referred to that watch
! and chain incident, which seems to be a
â  large feather in IVlaguire's boa of popular
ity. It is an incident in the life of Maguire
| Democrats do rot want the public to for

1 of a watch and chain he did not purchase
j strikes the Democrats forcibly and they .
| are using the fact for all it is worth.
"I heard Gape and several of his fol
lowers say that he i* not the railroad can- j
didate," said the sneaker. "Of course you '
know it is true! Nit! Barnes and Gage ;
want us to Lhink it is true, but as Mr.
Gage insists on traveling around the j
country with railroad attorneys and i
agents we must at least accept this as '
evidence that he is not at swords' points
Wi>h the giant -monopoly. I have known
Mr. Gage for ten years and I know he en-
Joys the respect of all who live in the
southern part of the State, but who I
knows him in this part of the country? |
Many others thought they were candi
dates for Governor, but as they stood
around waiting for lightning to strike I
them up bobbed Gage and he was nomln- I
ated by men many of whom never saw
him before." Terry continued on this
i strain much to the amusement of the
i crowd for some time, and then Introduced
I James H. Barry, Democratic nominee for
; Congress. Mr. Barry made a brief ad
; dres on the issues _of the campaign and
then retired. This marked the close of
the meeting, and with three cheers for
Democracy the crowd filed out to discuss
the issues around the dying embers of
! bonfires, built to attract and draw within
I the passing voter.
AT HIS OPPONENT'S HOME.
'. Tirey L. Ford Makes a Stirring Ad
dress at Bed Bluff.
RED BLUFF, Oct. 4.â A large and en
thusiastic meeting was addressed to-night
by Hon. Tlrey L. Ford, who made a most
favorable impression in the home of his
opponent by his eloquence, fairness and
I forceful argument. He urged that Call
j fornia should indorse the wise administrS
â  tion of President McKinley by defeating
the man who, as a member of Congress,
continually and persistently voted against
every measure the President wanted to
be passed. He spoke of the danger of the
6ingle tax being engrafted on the laws of
California, with the powerful influence of
Maguire as Governor upon the Legisla
ture.
Hon. D. E. McKinlay of Santa Rosa re
viewed the success of the protective is
sue in the last campaign, and declared
that if Maguire was not satisfied that the
railroad question is settled he would have
gone back to Congress from the Fourth
District. He made a strong plea for a
solid Republican delegation to Congress
from California and a Republican Legisla
ture, and showed the disastrous results
of Magulre's single-tax doctrine.
The meeting then adjourned with rous
ing cheers for the Republican candidates.

city yesterday. The following officers
were elected for the coming year: Henry
T. Oxnard, Nebraska, president; J. Ross
Clark, Montana, vice president: James

urer. A resolution was passed asking
the Republican party to keep the pledgee
in its platform as passed at St. Louis In
which home sugar was promised ade
quate protection. Annexation of foreign
islands with their pauper labor and trop
ical climate cannot go hand in hand with
the avowed protective policy on which
the Republican party came into power.

their just share of protection and expect
to receive it.

NEW YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
The New York Commercial under date of
September 27, says: "There Is no change in
the raisin situation, as compared with last
reports. Handlers are uncertain what to do
until the association announces its course as
to future prices. There Is still considerable in
quiry for good for September shipment, but
none are obtainable. All supplies are exhaust
ed up to October 8, when the change in price
Is liable to occur. The trade grumbles, but Is
powerless, and business must be done as the
association dictates. Unquestionably the asso
ciation will suffer in consequence, but that
doesn't hinder the fact that eventually all
raisins will move Into consumption, regardless
of the price, because people will have them.
There is some call for last year's crop, but
not sufficient to exert much influence. For
eign poods are meeting lair demand at un
changed prices.
"Prunes are perhaps the chief center of In
terest In dried fruits, bo far as trade is con
cerned. It appears that the output will bs
much smaller than has been anticipated, and
there is a probable increase in price ahead.
No Important sales ware announced yesterday,
either of spot or to arrive; but additional in
quiry seems to be developing, and the prospect
for Improvement is encouraging.
"Apricots are meeting considerably increased
domestic, as well as export demand, but trade
Is restricted b â  small offerings. Prices are
above buyers' views, but holders insist upon
present figures, believeing that they will be
able to get whatever they ask later. Peaches
are in much the same position. Supplies are
small, but spot and future prices are so high
that trade Is restricted. Demand appears to
be enlarged, however, and prospects tor better
trade Is Improving."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 4.â Considerable Irregular
ity marked to-day's operations In the stock
market, but the net result was In favor of the
bulls, final prices showing sharp gains in many
cases. Elements of strength included the St.
Paul statement for the fourth week of Septem
ber, gold engagements presaging further ease
in the monetary situpatlon and more general
commission houae buying. St. Paul was taken
In hand at the outset and lifted eharply, but
improvement In the general list was arrested
by Irregularity in the specialties. The market
generally speaking did not take on a decisive j
tone until the late session, when heavy buying :
orders were executed all around, which ad- I
vanced prices materially. Evidence that lead- \
Ing interests were supporting their favorites I
created uneasiness among the shorts and large ;
lotÃ were taken in. This likewise influenced
outside demand which had been eliminated from
the market during the demoralization of the
specialties. The bears attempted to make capi
tal out of the closing of the Tradesmen's Na- I
tlona! Bank, but it was not an effective card, !
as after a period of dullness, following the !
announcement, prices worked up slowly until
the movement assumed large proportions in the
late afternoon. The futile efforts to bring about â¢
b. substantial reaction, combined with the ready
absorption of all offerings, infused a more hope- |
ful feeling which became Intensified as addi
tional encouraging traffic statements came to
hand. Some lines reported a falling off In
earnings, but this showing, It was felt, would !
boob be counterbalanced by the elimination of i
certain unfavorable influences current at the j
present time. Tobacco pursued its usual wild
course, and no variations occurred In other I
members of the industrial group. Brooklyn
Transit made a conspicuous show of strength, â 
the stock being taken on expected benefits to '
accrue from the absorption of the Nassau road
and effective economies In operating expenses.
A concerted drive against Sugar late in the
day depressed the stock over three points and
halted the general market when the rise was in
full swing. Keallzation occurred all around,
but a better tone prevailed at the close, the
market ending steady.
The bond market to-day developed consider
able activity and heavy purchases were made
Jn the current active issues. The general tone
â¢was strong and a brisk Inquiry prevailed for
lome mortgages which usually do not figure
to any extent In the trading, notably St. Louis
and San Francisco liens. Total sales. $2,R50,000.
Considerable activity developed In United
States threee to-day, a gain being made of %.
per cent to 105%. Bid quotations of all other
issues were unchanged.

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK, Oct. 4â The Evening Post's j 1
London financial cablegram says: The stock ' 1
markets here continue'! stagnant to-day, but j f
the tone was fairly good. Gran.l Trunk was j i
good on traffic reports. More attention wai ; !
given to Americans in the belief that New I I
York liquidation of the unwieldy Industrials !
Is virtually complete and that Wall street Is
consequently healthier.
The Continent again bought American*.
Operators also lent some support. The advance
was led by St. Paul on the bull talk of Presi- j
dent Miller. It was also reported that leading ; '
Wall street operators were buying St. Paul | I
here, where the position can more easily be ;
carried. New York again sold this evening, j.l
but the reaction was not material. J
To-day's advance of 'Â» In the discount market I
here is due to anticipation of a possible rise â¢
In the German bank.
American bills are coming forward more 1
freely.

CHICAGO, Oct. 4.â Wheat started weak. A
report received before the opening , that Minne
apolis and Duluth receipts footed up 1927 cars,
1437 of which were credited to , Duluth, was a
body blow to bulls and started the. market on
a decline, December opening at 61%@61T4c com
1 pared with yesterday's close of 62'-i@62^ic. De
' cember sold at C1%@61%c shortly after the
opening.
Shortly after the opening, however, Northwest
receipts were corrected to 1203 cars. Instead of
1927. The price under the Improved demand
slowly advanced to C2Vic. This was the highest
point of the day. After 11 o'clock the market
began to sag again, but under news as bearish
as that received yesterday. Bradstreet's figures
on the world's visible showed 2,965,000 bushels
increase in this country and 4.200,000 bushels in
crease In and afloat for Europe, a total of 7.165.
000 bushels and more' than double the Increase
last year. It was far more than looked for, and
effectually settled the hope of the bulls for a
turn in the market. A more Influential factor
still was the total disappearance . during the
day of the October premium over December.
The primary receipts were again enormous and
helped to undermine the slightest bullish feel
ing that had struggled to find expression during
the early trading. The total for the day -was
1,968,000 bushele. Atlantic port clearances were
fairly good. 4.*8,000 bushels, but not sufficient
to counteract the effect of the primary receipts.
During the last hour's trading the selling pres
sure let up somewhat, and December, which
had declined to 61HÂ®<51%c, recovered to 61%@
61% c and closed at 61% c.

wheat. December ranged from 29% to 29% c and
closed %c higher at 29%@25%c.
There was a fair trade In Oats. The mar
ket was helped by Corn and advanced slightly,
holding Its strength to the close. May ranged
from 22% cto 22%@22%c and closed J /Â»&Wc
higher. â¢
Provisions were heavy. Continued prevalence
of yellow fever In the South, disappointment
over the small decrease in world's lard stocks ;
and liberal hog receipts were all bear influences.
At the close January Pork was 10c lower,
Lard 10c lower and Ribs 5c 16wer.

THE CURRANT MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 4.â The Journal of Com- i
merce cays: Repeated reports of an advancing
market for currants In Greece seem to have lit
tle Influence upon the demand from consumers
on this side. The consuming demand Is not
urgent and In spite of strong cables from pri
mary markets no speculative Interest has so
far been shown. Intimations have reached here
that a considerable part of the crop has been
l rain damaged and even if the output Is 160 000
tons, as has been asserted, there will be a com
paratively small percentage of desirable fruit
to supply the trade outside of the winemakers.
One thing that is expected to help the sale of
currants in American markets this year, not- ;
withstanding the comparatively high prices. Is ;
the scarcity and high cost of California seed- |
less raisins,, which for several years past have
been In active competition with them. let i
there seems a good deal of uncertainty as to
the future of Greek currants and much de-:
pends upon whether the Russians will admit
them for wine making purposes as heretofore or
exact the proposed increased duty.

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS, RAISINS, ETC.
The dullness of thin market for fruits Is due
to the arrival of large lines of contracted goods
which dealers want to dispose of before work-
Ing on the new arrivals. Peaches are weak.
Apples are steady and Aprlcote firm. Prunes
are selling moderately at the established quo
tations. The EaÃt Is not taking hold of Prunes
at all, being skeptical as to the short crop.
Raisins sbow no chance, but an advance Is
expected on the Bth. Honey continues very I
firm. '

NOTICE TO MARINERS.
Branch Hydrographlc Office. U. S. N., Mer
chants' Exchange, San Francisco, Cal, Oc
tober 4, 1898.
Forecast of wind and weather in the North
Pacific Ocean for October, 1898:
The sub-chart of Isobars and Isotherms for
this month, which appears elaawhere on the
chart, shows an almost permanent high with
its center near latitude 33 degrees north iÂ«ml
longitude 142 degrees west, consi'Jerablj south
and east of its position for September In 1 con
sequence of this southerly shifting of Pillion
of the high area, the trade wind limits ma> be
expected somewhat farther south than during
the preceding month, and probably not so
Cl ln r tt she5 he m zo r ne between 35 degrees north and 50
degrees north gales, accompanied with rain
may be expected with greater than
during September. Out of 21*2 observations in
that part of the ocean included between lati
tude 35 degrees north and SO degrees north and
longitude 125 desrees west and 145 degrees east
24 per cent give a force of wind above o ana I
per cent above 6 (Beaufort scale), as against
18 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, tor tne
month of September. In the China Sea and tne
vicinity of the Philippine Islands rain squalls
and thunder storms may be expected. Squally
weather maybe expected in the vicinity ot tno
Hawaiian Islands and on the coasts of Mexico
and Central America.
Occasional hlehs and lows will be found
mnvirs In a general easterly direction across
the ocean. Generally, in front of the cyclonic
arpa. or low, the weather is damp, with ther
mometer rising and barometer falling: while in
front of the anti-cyclonic circulation, or high,
it is dry. cooler, and the ban>m"ter rises. The
"average storm track" traced on the chart
shows the average path of the centers of these
lows. .
The avernge low over Asia will have movel
off the coast to the southeast, with its center
this month probably over the Philippine
Islands, while the hiph which has been inrminK
to the northward will he found well established
and of considerable area. The northeast mon
soon will probably be found blowing steadily
and the weather dryer and cooler.
Typhoons are not usually so frequent in Oc
tober as in September. The paths of a lew
typical typhoons that have occurred during Oc
tober in previous years are shown on the
chart. :
After crossing the line coming, north vessels
bound for the west coast of America may ex
pect heavy rain squalls, thunder storms and
frequent wind squalls.
Fog and heavy mist will be found along *a%
American coast, less frequently, however, thnn
last month. Occasionnl fog may also be ex
pected north of tho forty-fifth parallel from
the American coast to th^ Kuril Islands.

The worthy master appointed the usual
committees and this afternoon present- j
ed his annual report. In his remarks hft
said:
The Grange Is not a political organisation
and our declaration of purposes says that par
tisan or sectarian questions cannot be dis
cussed In it. nor can we call political conven
tions or nominate candidates. But a Patron of
HuHbandry does not give up that Inalienable
right and duty which belongs to every Ameri
can cltixen. the right of taking a proper In
terest in the politics of the country. Our na
t: rial organization has taken action In favor
of postal savings banks, pure food laws, rural
mall delivery, additional powers to the Inter
state Commerce Commission, speedy construc
tion of the Nicaragua Canal, etc.
The condition of the order In California in
some sections ie very satisfactory: In others it
will stand Improvement. In the whole we can
report progress. The conditions this spring
vrert such that It was deemed bt*st not to push
the work of organization, although we started
out with good success, but to await a more
favorable opportunity. Our finances are safe
and sound and our funds have been husbanded.
Our expenses are curtailed and we are pleased
to report that the receipts from October I, 1597,
to October 1, 1898, have exceeded our expendi
tures.
For forty-eight years agriculture has not
suffered in this State as it did this year. The
winter was long and cold, untimely frosts
caused loss and extreme drought, while hot, dry
winds caused a total failure of crops In some
sections and a shrinkage In nearly all. Prices
have not advanced In the same ratio and there
have been no corresponding reduction in the
fixed charges that the farmer must meet. Agri
cultural produce from as far east as the Mis
souri River has been placed fn our market and
*!nce times are hard for the farmer every
other Industry in the State has responded to
the setback agriculture has received.
To our subordinate granges we must look
for our success or failure as on order. Upon
thpir prosperity depends our existence. Our
problem Is how to improve, strengthen, enlarge
them and how to make active and earnest
workers.' A successful subordinate grange
should be supplied with regalia and parapher
nalia necessary to carry on Its work. The offi
cers should familiarize themselves with the
ritual and laws of the order. The members
rhould be educated in regard to the organiza
tion. Work must be planned and members kept
busy.
This evening there was a public recep
tion to the delegates. Judge E. M. Gib
fon presided, and speeches were made
by Mayor Thomas, Secretary Sharpe of
the Board of Trade and President Arper
of the Merchants' Exchange.
To-morrow the delegates will go to
the agricultural station at Berkeley.

HIS TROUBLES
THEN BEGAN
Peculiar Features of a
Divorce Suit.
A LOTTERY TICKET DISPUTE
AFTER FIVE YEARS MRS. M.
FARRELL OBTAINS A DECREE.
The Aged Husband Failed to Provide
and Was Cruel, but the Son
Came to Their Resue and
Suffered.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
008 Broadway, Oct. 4.
Superior Judge Greene this afternoon
granted Margaret Farrell a divorce from
John Farrell on the grounds of cruelty
and failure to provide. The parties are
past 60 years of age, and the suit was
brought originally live years-ago, within
which time the aged plaintiff has changed
her attorneys something like a dozen
times.
The suit was a peculiar one, for In her
endeavor to have certain alleged commun
ity property divided, plaintiff made her
stepson, John Joseph Farrell, a joint de
fendant.
Eight years ago John Joseph Farrell
helped his father pegging shoes in a lit
tle cobbler's sho on Eighth street, near
Washington. One night on his way home
he purchased a lottery ticket which won
$15,000. Just prior thereto his father had
married the plaintiff, who Is his second
wife. She lived unhappily in a nice lit
tle cottage at t>2l Twenty-seventh street.
There was a $2500 mortgage on this place,
and when John Joseph suddenly oetame
possessed of the small fortune he came
to the rescue of his. parents like a good
Christian son and had the mortgage as
signed to him. Subsequently he was com
pelled to foreclose in order to clear the
title, and, there being no bidders, he uid
the property in himself. The stepmother
was soon thereafter ousted.
Mr?. Farrell claimed that the lottery
ticket was purchased jointly by her hus
band and stepson, and that she was inere
fore entitled to her share in the divi-
slon.
At the trial to-day Judge Greene held
that there had been absolutely no proof
to show that the elder Farrell had a
cent or any interest In the property. He
granted the divorce, and, by way of re
minding the defendant husband that ac
had been married at one time to plaintiff,
the alimony was fixed at $10 per month.
"I was happy before I won that $15,0v0,"
said young Farrell to-day, "but I had that
| mortgage assigned to me, and devil a bit
,o' rest I've had ever since. I paid the
: mortgage, paid for sewer and street im
provements and all, and my stepmother
| has been trying to get half of it ever
j since I got it. I'm blasted if I don't get
: rid of that property just as quick as I
j can, for it's a hoodoo to me."
During the trial W. Maguire testified
I that he heard John Farrell had struck his
sister, the plaintiff, "but," said lie, "if

"NO PEDDLERS" NOT A
SIGN TO LAUGH AT
ANNOYED AT BEING ASKED TO
BUY SCENTED SOAP.
A Police Court Jury Has Already
Shown That It Is in Sym
pathy With the
Measure.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Oct. 4.
City Attorney Dow has reported that the
ordinance making it a misdemeanor for
! peddlers to annoy residents who have a
â  sign prohibiting them from attempting to
j sell their goods is legal and can be en-
I forced as a police regulation.
This ordinance has been under conslder
j ation for some months and by a strange
; series of circumstances nearly every
Councilman was led to favor it because of
personal inconvenience. When Mr. Wood- j
; ward announced that he favored I
I the ordinance and had a sign
ion his steps, "Peddlers are forbidden i
j here," several of his brother Councilmen
laughed at him. But a week later Mr
: Heltman and Mr. Girard had both been
i disturbed while taking an afternoon cigar
and they were won over to the ordinance
I StHl>, later Councilmen Earl and Cuvelller
: were annoyed by peddlers and still an
â  other Councilman threw one down his
â  steps because he persisted in attempting
; to sell him some scfjited soup.
Eight out of the twelve Councilmen i
i have been thus converted to the necessity j
, of such an ordinance and now the Council
; has ordered it to be printed preparatory i
;to Its final passage. There is an idea at !
, large that the annoyance to which the 'â 
Councilmen were subjected was not aito- ;
gether accidental, but was a preconceived â¢
; plan of two or three citizens who were !
determined to secure relief from the i
; hordes of peddlers that work in the resi
dence portions of the city. Another theory
is that some storekeeper having a lot of
; peddler signs on hand thought this would I
Ibe a good way to get rid of them, but I
President Heitman declares that no such I
ruse was worked off on the unsuspecting â 
About two months ago a police officer
in East Oakland was aroused from
his slumbers after being out all
night by two peddlers, who ig
nored the sign on his gatepost. He
took summary vengeance on the disturb
er and later had him arrested for dis
turbing his peace. A jury in the Police
Court convicted the peddier and declared
that the officer had behaved very prop
erly. The ordinance will become a law in
about two weeks.
Located a Chinese Leper.
OAKLAND, Oct. 4.â A Chinese who has
been camping under the old band stand at
Badger's Park, near a shed roof which
some boys had constructed for him, has
attracted the attention of the health au
thorities, and a careful examination of
the man by Health Officer Dunn and Dr.
Kitchings disclosed the startling revela
tion that he is suffering from leprosy. Mrs.
Bam Cloxton, who lives near Badger's,
says the Chinese came there last Monday.
I A guard has been placed over him.
The Sentence Staggered Hodges.
OAKLAND, Oct. 4.â Bert Hodges, orig
inally charged with assaulting little Ger
! trude Will, which charge was subsequent
! ly reduced to simple battery, to which ho
i had pleaded not guilty and demanded a
jury trial yesterday, changed his mind to
day and pleaded gulltj in Police Judge
Allen's court, evidently expecting to get
the minimum sentence. He was stag
gered â¢ when Judge Allen pronounced a
sentence of six months.
Lady Yarde-Buller Objects.
OAKLAND, Oct. 4.â Lady Yarde-Buller
has written to Mayor Thomas declaring
that she "has not dedicated one foot of her
property to the city of Oakland." The
letter presumably refers to the opening
of Fallon street, which street runs
through the property of the late General
Kirkham, pf whom the protestant Is a
daughter.
The Water Front Trial.
OAKLAND, Oct. 4.â The trial of the
water front case was resumed before
Judge Ogden to-day. About one hundred
exhibits were Introduced in evidence, and
the attorneys for the city rested their
case Barring further delays the case will
be submitted within two weeks.
THE SA]N FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBEB 5. 189 S.
TAX LEVY IS
DEPENDENT ON
THE MAYOR
Reading Rooms Are
Ordered Closed.
WOODWARD IS ELOQUENT
GIRARD SAYS THE MEASURE IS
A GREAT OUTRAGE.
Pringle Declares That the City Gov
ernment Cannot Be Run if
Money Is Sunk in Lake
Merritt.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 4.
The first effect of the tax levy passed
by the Council last night is already felt.
The Board of Free Library Trustees has
sent orders to Librarian Peterson to
close all the reading rooms and to run
the free library only from 1 to 6 p. m.,
and to reduce the salaries of all the em
ployes 25 per cent. This action is de
clared to be necessary on account of the
small allowance in the tax levy for the
free library. i
The ordinance was signed this morning
by President Heitman, and is now in the
i hands of the Mayor, on whom it depends
to become a law or to be vetoed. Public
opinion has been very freely expressed
i that the tax levy as constituted is op
i posed to the city's best interests. It pro
| vides enormous sums of money for im
j provements on Lake Merritt and vicinity
i and cuts down about 25 per cent the
| amounts for the various departments of
' the city government.
Councilman (Jirard declares that the
High School will have to close four
months in the year, and that the streets
cannot be cleaned or the city lighted if
i the ordinance be signed by the Mayor.
' Councilman Pringle declares it to be im
i possible to run the city on the proposed
I levy.
Councilman Woodward, who once fur
nished a long typewritten report in de
fense of his vote on the water-rate or
[ dinance, which, by the way, has never
: yet been adopted, treated the Council to
another type-written speech in which he
makes all kinds of defenses for the ordi
nance. Mr. Woodward even assumed the
role of dictator to the newspapers, and
i one of his typewritten paragcaphs read:
"If the newspapers should make an at
tack upon these gentlemen (the Lake
â¢ Merritt Improvement Club) and call
; them schemers to rake the city treas
! ury when they apply to the city author
: ities for relief from the outrageous state
of affairs which exists in and around Lake
: Merrittâ the city's water parkâ such
I newspapers would be silenced forever."
Just how the "silencing" would be done
or just what Woodward meant is not ap
! parent in his speech.
"If the Mayor signs that ordinance,"
! said Mr. Girard to-day, "it will be an
outrage. The people of Temescal have
as much right to expect the city to build
their sewers as have the millionaires re
siding around Lake Merritt. It is said
that the men who compose the Lake Mer
ritt Club own one-third of all the wealth
of this city. If this be so, they can well
afford to pay for building their own
sewers. Show me a case in which the
Council has spent in ten years $38,500
or as many cents for building sewers fur
poor taxpayers. LakÂ« Merritt is in need j
of attention, but it is absurd to provide
$80,000 for dredging it and $38,500 for build
ing sewers "as a sanitary measure." The
work should be spread over at least two !
years and the sewers should be paid for
by those who will benefit by them.
"The taxpayers of this city do not fully
realize what this means, or if they did j
they would at once take such steps as
will prevent such a waste of public mon
ey If these millionaires who live around
the lake want their property improved
let them pay for it. I can call to mind
that twenty years were consumed in try
ine to influence the Oakland Council to
spend $6000 in West Oakland, eradicating
a nuisance that pent many of our chil
dren into their graves. No one will con
tend that Lake Merritt in fifty years
time will be as foul as was the West
Oakland marsh, but men poor people live
in West Oakland.
CIGARETTES CANNOT BE
BOUGHT IN OAKLAND
: TOBACCO AND RICE PAPER NO
DETRIMENT TO MORALS.
A Puzzle That Is Causing Many to
Wonder What Purpose Is
Served by the New
Law.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 4.
The law prohibiting the sale of cigar
i ettes is in force, and Oakland is now set- ;
| ting the same example to the State that
Alameda has held up for. several months.
< For four days it has been impossible to
! purchase cigarettes in this city, but there
: are as many of the seductive little things
! being puffed away as heretofore, and deal
â  ers are wondering what inspired Mr. Hen-
I neberry's ordinance.
The new law makes it a misdemeanor to
buy cigarettes to smoke them in public
I places, or to give them away, but It says
'< nothing whatever about the sale of cigar
! ette papers or the sale of cigarette to
i bacco. Consequently everybody is becom
! ing expert at rolling the cigarettes, at the
> same time wondering why it is more sin
i ful to smoke a home made cigarette than
one purchased at a store.
However, the cigar dealers have no de
i sire to disobey the new law, for a careful
! canvass of the leading cigar merchants In
j the center of the city failed to produce
j one who -would sell a package of cigar
ettes. This is something unusual, but no
i "one has yet been able to see wherein mor
ality has been served by the Henneberry
ordinance.
The Prohibition county convention paid
Mr. Honneberry a high compliment for his
I efforts to abolish the deadly cigarette, and
I there are those cruel enough to say that
' Mr. Henneberry had some such indorse-
J ment in view when he framed the ordin-
ance.
There are some cigar dealers who be
lieve that they see a way of getting
around the law. Some time ago it was
declared that the nickel-in-the-slot ma
chines were legal and not gambling de
vices if the person who put the nickel
in the slot received a cigar that was fairly
worth 5 cents. Now it is argued that if
the machine pays its debts to the specu
lator in packages of cigarettes the law's
spirit is not violated while cigarettes are
disposed of. This question will sooner or
later have to be decided in the police
courts.
CENTRAL BAPTIST CONFERENCE

OAKLAND, Oct. 4.â The eighteenth an

ALAMEDA TAX LEVY.
It Is Fixed at SI 05 on the $100.
One of the Trustees Talks
Plainly.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 4.â At the session of
the Board of City Trustees last evening
the tax rate for the coming year was
fixed at $1 05 on the $100 of assessed valu
ation. The various departments of . c
city government had submitted estimates
based on careful and economical manage
ment, as claimed by them, which would
have made a rate of $1 10 necessary.
When the matter came up at last
night's meeting Trustee Fletter moved
that the rate be made $1 10. Trustee Brick
moved that it be made $1 05. In support
of his motion to make the rate $1 10 Mr.
Fletter said that he would be glad if the
rate could be made 75 cents, but he did
not Bee how the city government could be
run on the $1 05 basis without creating a
deficiency. He believed that the city
would run $6000 behind by the end of the
year with the rate proposed. He did not
want to see the library forced to be closed
all but two hours a day, as was the case
in Oakland owing to the reduction In the
estimates for carrying on cily government.
Brick favored the $1 05 rate in a speech
that was applauded by the lobby, and
when the motion was put it was carried
by a vote of four to one, Trustee i letter
In the negative.
Last year the tax rate w.as $1 12. while
this year there are over $10,000 more of
bonds to be paid off.
The Crematory Wreckers.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 4.-Blodgett and Dil
larocco, two of the youths charged with
wrecking the garbage crematory on the
marshes were examined to-day before
Justice Morris. The latter, who is the son
of an Oakland scavenger, was held to an
swer a charge of burglary-, with bonds
set at $500. Blodgett will have his case
â  further considered on Friday. Nothing
was elicited which tended to confirm the
suspicion that the scavengers were be
j hind the matter and were desirous cf
crippling the crematory so as to protect
their own business.

ALAMEDA, Oct. 4.â A. H. Cohen, the
ivi li known attorney, has been charged
with a felony by Ivy L. Borden, Superin
tendent of the Artesian Water Works.
The charge is that Cohen committed an
assault upon the person of Borden by
means and force calculated to produce
great bodily injury. The charge grows
out of the occurrence qf last summer
when Cohen drove into Borden's cart, up
setting it, throwing Borden out and
breaking his leg.

OAKLAND, Oct. Iâ Ch&rlefl Reisenwe

suicide.

when 1 heard our boy crying," Mid Mr.
Reisenweber to Captain Wilson. "I went
in and told my wife that she ought not
to strike the boy. as he is very sensitive
She became very angry, and finally struck |
me in the face. I lost my temper for a
moment and slapped her. Then she tried
to get the bottle of carbolic acid, and I
had a hard struggle to prevent her from
drinking it. Next she locked herself in a
room, and I had to break the door in
and held her until she promised not to do
away with herself.
"After this she changod her clothes ami
put on her hat. She kissed our boy good
by and told him he would never set- his

useless for me to try to stop her. as she
would have scratched and bitten me and
would have raised a big disturbance.
When she gets very an&ry she seems to
become insane. She has gone off before in
this way. but what frightened me this
time was her kissing the boy and saying
that he would not see her again.

into quarantine by the United States
quarantine officer. It did not take long
to fumigate and overhaul the troopship,
so during the afternoon she was clocked
at I'u.eiflc street wharf.
The Senator was nearly ten days com
ing up from Honolulu, where she stopped
to have her boilers cleaned and some
minor damage received in a typhoon re
paired. She has not been docked

waters has not improved her any. She
sailed from Manila the day after the city
was taken by the American troops. Cap
tain Patterson had his ship anchored
about five miles away from the fortiflca
and watched the whole proceedings.
He saw the Olympia. Raleigh, Petrel and
D lire on the town to th<

light draught, stood close In shore and

of the marching soldiers. Soon after this
the Raleigh and Olympia drew off, but
the two gunboats kept up their tire until
tiny could be of no further use to the
soldiers.

It will take about a week to get the

will probably go on the drydock to-day,
and ;ts she has been cleaned and painted

idy for the troops as quickly as
The Newport, which sailed from

will sail in company.

will be the 24th or 25th inÃt. before the
second lot of soldiers will get away.
There will not be near as much crowd-
Ing on the transports on this occasion.
Many of the bunks are to be taken out so
that' there will be more breathing space
for the troops. The provisioning of the
is is also to be carefully looked after
the men will be as well fed as they
are In camp.

FOX WINS HIS
CASE AGAINST
HAYWARD ET AL
Decision Adverse to
Hale & Norcross.
! SUPREME COURT'S ORDERS
OVERCHARGES FOR MILLING
MUST BE MADE GOOD.
Damages That Resulted From Fraud
ulent Loss of Precious Metal
Remitted by Request a*
the Plaintiff.
The Supreme Court has rendered a final
decision in the case known as M. \V. Fox
vs. the Hale it Norcross Silver Mining
Company et at., and I â¢â¢ the decision Fox
and his colleagues are the winners by
many thousand dollars, which muat be
paid to them on judgment.
The case has been dragging along for
i years, ami it has had more legal
shuffling about than a ball in a tennis
court. Fox and his associates sued the
management of the company for some
thing like a million and a half dollars,
and among the allegations was that of
fraud in improper milling by allowing
large quantities of valuable metal to go
out with the tailings. The important fea
tures of this case are thus set forth In the
decision:
Under the complaint a recovery was
sought from the defendants In behalf of
the corporation upon two distinc; claims
or causes of actionâ one for the difter
between the amount paid by the cor
poration for the milling of the ores and
the actual cost thereof and the other for
damages sustained by reason of imper
fect and fraudulent milling of the ores.
At the former trial of the case the bu
perior Court found that upon the lirst or
claims the corporation had paid
7 50 for milling the ores in excess of
the actual cost, ana that for->the.r cause of
action It had sustained damage to the
amount of $789.1 LB, and rendered judg
ment against the defendants for these
amounts Upon the appeal the Supreme
c.am affirmed the decision of the supe
rior Court upon the first issue, but
reversed its decision upon the sec
ond, and remanded the. cause, with direc
tions to the Superior Court to enter a
judgment against the defendants as of the
date of its former judgment lor the
amount of $210.197 50, with interest from
that date Upon the issue presented by
ihe claim for damages sustained by rea-
C the imperf-ct and fraudulent mul
the ores, the order denying a new
trial wns set out. and the Superior court
was directed to retry that issue and make
its findings of fact in accordance with the
views expressed in the opinion of the su
preme Court.
The Superior Court found that the cor
poration had sustained damage in the sum
of $417,688 from the fraudulent and imper
fect milling of the ores; and thereupon
ed Judgment againt the defendants
that the plaintiff have and recover from
them for the use and benefit of the cor
poration the sum of $210,197 60, with inter
est thereon from the Uth day of June,
1592 Lit the legal rate, upon the issue pre
sented by the claim for having paid an
excessive price for milling the ores, and
the further sum of $417.6*3, with interest
thereon from the nth day of June, 1892.
upon the issue presented by the claim for
damages sustained by reason of the im
perfect and fraudulent milling of said
From the judgment the last appeal was
taken. After the hearing of the appeal.
Fox filed in the Supreme Court a release
of all claims for damages, by reason of
the imperfect and fraudulent milling of
the ores, and has made a motion that the
judgment appealed from be modified by
striking out that portion which authorized
a recovery of any portion of the damages
thus sustained; and that upon such notifi
cation the judgment appealed from be
affirmed. In reply it is urged by the de
fendants that, instead of granting the mo
tion, the. cause should be remanded to the
Superior Court and the action made there.
The court held that Fox's motion was in
accordance with the practice of the court
and says:
Whether respondent (Fox) makes such con
sent for the reason that he is convinced that
he cannot prevail in the action, or, as was
suggested in Carpentier vs. Gardiner, supra,
because he prefers to remit the whole of the
damages upon this cause of action rather
than submit to the delay and in
convenience consequent upon a new trial,
his motion for a modification of the Judgment
should be granted. The release by the re
spondent of all claim for the damages thus
sustained, and his consent that the Judgment
be modified by striking out that portion there
of which authorizes a recovery upon this is
sue, has the effect to withdraw from considera
tion upon this appeal all matters involved in
the rendition of this portion of the judgment,
and to leave for determination only the judg
ment rendered upon the other issue presented
by the complaint. The judgment of this court
upon the former appeal denying the appel
lants' motion for a new trial upon the issue
presented by the claim for excessive charges
paid for milling the ores, and directing that
judgment be entered against them for the
amount found by the court to the amount of
that excess, was a final determination of the
rights of the parties upon that issue, and the
action of the Superior Court in entering such
judgment was a compliance with the mandate
of this court, and. as its judgment upon this
issue is in strict accordance therewith, there
Is no ground for an appeal therefrom, and this
portion of the judgment must be affirmed.
The proposition of the defendants that
if the second cause of action is withdrawn
they are entitled to tho costs of the second
trial, the court holds is contrary to law
;inil In conclusion Justice Harrison, who
â wrote thf- opinion, says:
The cause is remanded to th<Â» Superior <"Ymrt.
and that court is directed to modify its Judg
ment herein by striking out those portions
thereof which authorize a recovery from the
appellant? of "the further sum of $417. G53, with
Interest thereon at the legal rate from the 11th
day of June, lSft2, upon the tsaue presented by
the claim for damages sustained by reason of
the imperfect and fraudulent milling of said
ores, together with plaintiff's costs disbursed
at the former trial, amounting to the sum of
$840 40, and the further costs given upon the
second trial amounting to $1564 W ; and also
that portion thereof which dlrectH that the
plaintiff have execution for the said "further
mm of 1417,681, with Interest thereon at the
legal rate, from June 11, 1592." As so modi
fled, the Judgment Is affirmed. The coots of this
appeal are to be borne by the respondent.
DEATH BY THE ACID ROUTE.
Albert Trambley, a Junk Dealer, Dies
by His Own Hand.
Albert Trambley, a junk dealer residing
at the corner of Sixth and Folsom streets,
committed suicide last evening by taking
two ounces of carbolic add.
Trambley called early in the evening on
friends at 805 Howard street, and while
at the dinner table poured the deadly acid
Into a teacup and tossed it off without
being noticed by his friends. He sud
denly arose from the table, asked forgive
ness for what he had done, and chowed
them the empty bottle.
He was at once taken to Ladd's drug
store at Fourth and Howard streets, and
from there was removed to the Receiving
Hospital, where he died shortly after ar
rival.
The dead man has been despondent over
the loss of his wife, who died a week ago
at the County Hospital, and this and his
penniless condition are assigned as the
causes for his self-murder. The body
was removed to the Morgue.
Gave Himself Up.
Henry Boacom, who with Mrs. Mar
garet Shields was recently arrested upon
a charÂ«e Of arson, gave himself up last
night at the City Prison in answer to a
bench warrant issued by Judge Mogan on
Monday.
The original bail bond for $3000, upon
which Beacon vaa released, was discov
ered to be worthless and the warrant was
l&sued upon that finding.
Bail has been Increased to $WX>O.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1898.
HAS JUMPED UP

OF FIVE YEARS
Expense of Sweeping
the Streets.
IT NOW COSTS $175,000
STREET DEPARTMENT FUNDS
ARE APPORTIONED.
The Sewers Will Not Receive Proper
Attention, According to
Auditor Broderick's
Opinion.
The Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors, in conjunction with Su
perintendent of Streets Ambrose, has de
cided upon the segregation of the Street
Department fund for the ensuing fiscal
year as folllows:
For air.* to county roads, $10, 000; sweep
ing, $175,000; cleaning and repairing sewers,
$75,000; repairing and repaying accepted streets,
$59,724; airing streets with bitumen (con
tract), 119,000; Improvements in front of city
property, $5000; Improvements and maintenance
of parka ana squares, $35,000; engineering and
surveys, $5000; total. $383,724.
For culvert. Canal and Mission streets, $6500;
tunnel, Bosworth street, $12,500; Market street,
$9776; Sunset sewer, $16,000; grading Yon Ness
avenue, $1500; Market street, from Sixth to
Van Ness avenue, $40,000; sewer, Brannan and
Army streets, $2S,000; gates, Brannan street,
$2000; total for special objects, $116,276. Total
appropriation, $600,000.
It had been the Intention of the Finance j
Committee to submit the entire schedule j
of the segregated funds of the various
departments at the last meeting of the
Supervisors, but owing to the illness of
Supervisor Delany the presentation wns
I postponed until the next meeting.
It is predicted that the segregation of
; the funds of the Street Department, as
arranged, will meet with active opposi
tion from several Supervisors who have
certain schemes in view for which no
adequate provision is made. The oppesi
tion may develop sufficient strength to
j effect some changes in the schedule as
: presented. The "political necessities" of
the Street Department, in the way of
1 giving employment to camp followers, are
i generally recognized as extraordinary by
the Democratic Supervisors, but this year :
i they seem to be strangely callous to the !
urgent demands of Superintendent Am- j
brose. Instead of allowing him the whole
half million dollars to spend on wages j
: to the said camp followers they have cut I
. down his allotment for this laudable pur
i pose to $383. 724. and have decided to
"waste" a cool $116 ,27ff On contracts for
I street improvements.
Auditor Broderick, when shown the
I schedule of the segregated fund yester
â¢ day. remarked: "Whew! They are put
j ting it strong for street sweeping. JlT.'i.
000. Why, five years ago the sweeping j
only cost $100,000. They have not allowed
enough for cleaning sewers, however. The
sum of $75,000 will be utterly insufficient."
The Auditor's annual report, handed
i in to the Board of Supervisors Monday,
was not completed owing to the delay
of the Finance Committee in reporting
the segregation of funds fur the coming
year, but me blanks will be filled alter I
1 the report is made.

LAVIGNE AND TRACEY.
The Saginaw Kid Will Arrive To-
Morrow and Will Sign Arti
cles for a Fight.
"Kid" Lavfgne is expected here from
! the East on Thursday and will go to some
: training station near this city Immediate
ly after his arrival, where he will con
; dltion himself for his contest with Tom
Tracey. The National Club has .set no
i date tor the light as yet, but in all prob
i ability it will Be held in Woodward I.*1 .* Pa
vilion some evening in the latter part of
this month. Tracey is stationed at Ala
meda and according to his manager, Al
i King, he is now ready to enter the ring.
i The Australian will have the best of the
weight by about four or five pounds, but
as Lavlgne has been handicapped in giv
ing weight away in almost every battle
he has had in the past, his friends exped
Ito see him polish off Tracey in good
style.
If Corbett has patched up his differences
with McCoy, which seems probable ac
cording to "late dispatches, the proposed
; Jeffries and Corbett contest will not take
place for some time, If at all.
The National Club is not very anxious
i to capture the Corbett-Jeffries match, as
' its managers are of the opinion that Jef
fries is altogether too slow for Corbett
land that the contest, on that account,
i â¢would be lacking in Interest. But if Cor
bett will sign articles to aieet Tom Shar
kej in a twenty-round bout the National
CJub will willingly "hang up" a $15,000
j puree, which is, by several thousands of
' dollars, a better stake than any of the
heavyweights can get in the East.
It can be safely said that a return
: match between George Green and Myste
i rious Hilly Smith will he consummated
â  within the next two months.
Smith has sent word to a friend in this
J city that ho will fight Green at any time
1 but} place, consequently the match is as
good as made, as Green is very anxious
to settle up old scores with Smith.

NOTARY COONEY
HAS SECURED
A DISMISSAL
The Law Favored the
Accused Man.
HE COULD NOT BE HELD
SUPREME COURT DECISION ENDS
THE CASE.
A Perjury Charge Based on a Deposi
tion Cannot Be Prosecuted Un
less the Deposition Is
Delivered.
The prosecution of ex-Notary J. J.
Cooney for alleged perjury in connection
with the Craven-Fair deeds came to a
halt with a jolt yesterday and the case
was dismissed.
George A. Knight's statement of Mon
day that the prosecution was a farce was
well founded, and the law backed up his
statement. When the case was called yes
terday the jury was completed, and then
Cooney'a attorneys moved for a dismissal.
It was shown as a matter of law that the
prosecution could not continue and Judge
Wallace instructed the jury to bring in a
verdict of acquittal.
After the motion for dismissal had been
made District Attorney Hinkle was re-
I fused an opportunity to present a state
! ment of the allegations the prosecution
; expected to prove. The point of the mo
tion to dismiss was based on the fact that
Cooney's alleged crime was committed in
his giving a deposition to support the Cra
ven-Fair deeds. The statute concerning
perjury provides that if a witness declares
that which he knows to be false then he
is guilty of perjury. In the, case of B
the Supreme Court held that in event per- I
jury was committed, not in open court, i
but in a deposition, the perjurer could not j
be convicted of the offense unless ho baa
delivered the deposition. The information j
against Cooney failed to state that he had
delivered the deposition and wan, there
fore, insufficient to justify further prose- |
cution.
Judge Wallace agreed that the court
was bound by the decision of the Supreme
Court. Had the deposition made by Coo
ney been admitted in the Craven case the j
i information would have been valid and j
the prosecution would have been allowed
I to Introduce testimony for the purpose of
establishing the truth of UÂ»3 perjury
charge.
After the jury, in obedience to Judge
Wallace's Instruction, found a verdict of,
! acquittal, the prisoner was discharged and j
his sureties exonerated from further lia
bility on his bond.

PECULIAR POLICE METHODS
CHIEF LEES AND HIS INIQUI
TOUS "SMALL BOOK."
An Old Man Thrown in the "Tanks"
and His Son Refused the
Right to See
Him.
The Iniquitous system of the Pollco De
partment in 'â small booking" a prisoner
is likely to receive a well merited rebuke
in the next few days.
About 10 o % clock Monday night Timothy
Flynn, ag.-d 70 years, was arrested by
Detective O"Dea on suspicion of having
injured a man named Frai k Foy. In-
Btead of giving him a chance to secure his
freedom on bonds the police threw him in
the "tanks" and denied him the right to
b friends. His son James, who Is a
well known contractor, visited the prison,
but was not allowed to see his I
One of the officials, with matchless ef
frontery, even denied that the old man
was in' durance vile. After sati
:â¢â¢ that his father was locked up in
nks Flynn Jr. summoned Attorney
Long, who also vainly endea
rendant. Angered beyond
measure at not being allowed to sec his
father Flynn Jr. called at Chief Lees' res
e and demanded to know why he
could not speak to his aped parent. Lees
attempted to explain tin- "small book'
system, but as Flvnn was obdurate the
gave him a note to the prison
sergeant, telling him to allow him I
This was several hours after
Fiynn Sr. had been arrested.
It is the intention of Attorney Long to
vigorously criticize the "small book' sys
tem when â¢ â â - heard in the Police
Court. He will Incidentally pay his re
i to the Police Department ;iJid its
uncharitable practle. the least,
of drasrtrinp an old man away from his
hom>- and throwing him in a dungeon to
nnot consult with his friends.
Evidently anticipating the threatened
â¢ es yesterday morning cr-
Detective ODea to place a charge
of battery against Flynn. Tie was at once
sod on bonds. Shortly afterward a
Mrs. Nellie MeFarland appeared i
Judge Low and swore to a complaint
charging: Flynn with assault to murder.
She is the sister-in-law of Foy. his al
leged victim. According- to her sworn
Fti'toment she saw Flynn strike Foy,
knocking him down. Foy and Flynn had
trouble about eighteen months ago. Since
then they have not been on speaking

walked away as if fearing arrest. Foy's
skull is fractured in two places, and the
attending physician has few hopes of his
recovery.
Flynn declares that he was in bed when
the alleged assault occurred, and that he
can prove it by several witnesses. Foy's
Ftory of being robbed of $20 is not believed
by the police;
DEFENSE OUTLINED
IN WIDBER'S CASE
ASKS FOB A VEBDICT OF AC
QUITTAL.
Counsel for the Accused Contends
That the Prosecution Has Failed
to Establish Its
Case.
The prosecution closed and the defense
In the Widber case yesterday.
During the morning session the prosecu
tion occupied the time In putting a fln- j
lshing touch on the case. Mayor Phelan j
was recalled and identified sixteen sacks ,
â which had been tampered with. Deputy ]
County Clerk V. F. Northrup then iden- | <
tified papers showing amounts of money i
that had been placed in the treasury and '
subsequently removed. Deputy Treasurer
de la Montanya then testified that the
amount of money in the treasury during :
the month of November was very low ]
and that It greatly increased during the I
following month.
The <-a.se of the prosecution then closed
and Attorney Pelxotto outlinfd the de
fense He asserted that it had not been
phown that Wldber had stolen the miss-
Ing funds. None of the witnesses exam
ined had so testitted. he said, but had
merely stated that Widber had accused
himself of the crime. And when Widbe-r
accused himself of the crime he was un
d'-r the influence of liquor, was suffering \
fmm the effects of a protracted debauch j
and was not mentally competent to make
a lucid statement regarding the matter.
"The accused never made a statement
that he had stolen the money, but ac
knowledged that he was civilly respon
sible " continued the attorney, "and we
acknowledge that he is civilly responsible
but deny that he is so criminally. The
accused always had a good reputation for
truth, honesty and integrity, and it waa
the thought that he might be accused of
criminal connection with the disappear
ance of the funds and the knowledge that
he would be held civilly responsible that
caused him to go on a debauch and place
his mind in a condition to be easily in
fluenced. He did not fire nor try to con
ceal the shortage. When he left the city
he did so at the bidding of his friends.
Considering these facts the attorney
Stated that he expected an acquittal.
Many witnesses, among whom were
Charles D. Holmes. Thomas J. Barbour,
J. O. Reis, Henry Sachs, A. C. McFarland
and Frank Zacharias, were called to tes
tify relative to the character of the ac
cused. All admitted that previous to the
present difficulty the prisoner had always
borne a good reputation. The defense
then offered documents in evidence show-
Jng that Widber was the owner of prop
erties prior to the period when the pecu
lations commenced and in consequence
could not. as charged, have spent the
city's funds In their purchase. The jury
then visited the Treasurer's office to get
an idea of the position of the various
vaults and money drawers. Then the
case went over till to-day.

The latest movement of the society for
the importation and Bale of Chinese wo
men developed yesterday when Judge Â».
C Denson appear.-. 1 before United States
District Judge de Haven and moved that
the women captured in the recent raid in
Chinatown and now confined in the Pres
byterian and Methodist missions be trans
ferred to the Alameda County jail. When
Judge de Haven in surprise asked why
the transfer was urged. Judge Denson re
plied that the people at the missions were
trying to force religion upon the women
and that the women had complained of it.
Deputy United States Attorney Schlesin
ger opposed the motion and s;iid that the
object of the transfer was to allow the
highbinders an opportunity to visit the
women and post them as to what they
should say in court and thus endeavor to
defeat the ends of Justice. Judge de
Haven took the matter under advisement.
Miss Cameron of the Presbyterian Mis
sion was indignant when she beard that
Judge Denson had made such a charge
against her. Six- said she could hardly
believe he had done so. He had vi.-ii'-d
the mission the day before with another
lawyer named A. 11. Yordi and two China
men, whom he introduced as lnterpr-
The Judge presented an order from United
States Marshal Shine, per Chief <'lerk
Farish, to allow the party to talk with the
prisoners.
"I did not hear all that they paid,"
acided Miss Cameron, "for several reasons.
First, I am not an export in the Chinese
language, then 1 was not present all of
the time, and besides, there was consid
erable whispering. The women .seemed to
bÂ© acquainted with the Chinamen whom
Judge Denson brought with him. Judge
Denson expressed his approval of the ar
rangements here for the women and made
no complaint whatever as to the religious
proposition. We never force the women to
attend services. They are free to attend
or remain up stairs; many of them do not
attend."
I LEAGUE FOB IMPBOVEMENTS.
A New City and County Hospital
Still in Demand by Missionites.
The Mission League of Improvement
Clubs at its meeting last night In Man
nerhund Hall on Bryant avenue dls
eussed th<? building of a new City and
County Hospital, according to the plans
formulated by the present Board of Super
visors. The action of the board in neg
lecting to avail itself of the provisions
of the act of tho Legislature in author
izing the necessary expenditure for that
purpose was censured by the members of
the league.
The executive committee of the league
was Instructed to arrange for a mass
meeting in the near future at which all
the nominees for Supervisors and Street
Superintendent will be invited to attend
and give their views on the subject of
a new hospital and subjects pertaining
to the needed improvements of that por
tion of the Mission district. Such of the
nominees as may impress the league
members with their intention to carry
out these views are morally certain of
getting the support of the league.
President T. B. Slevin desires it to be
understood that In no way will the
league become a political machine for
the furtherance of the nominees of any
one party. These views were coincided
In by those present as being proper, as
the league is not political in any sense
of the word.
Suit of Tailor-Made Clothes.
M. Rothchild, 211 Sutter street, swore
to a complaint in Judge Conlan's court
yesterday for the arrest of Maud An

by false pretenses. He alleges that on
September 15 she procured irom him â¢ a
tailor-made suit valued at 565 on an order
from T. Brilliant, another tailor, and he
later found that the suit was for the
girl's mother and that she had abscond.. l.
She has returned to the city and he now
wants her arrested.

THE SAiNT FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1898.
UNDER THE CURSE OF
PERPETUAL SILENCE
A Case in Court Where All Concerned Are Deaf
and Dumb.
AS queer an aggregation as ever
sought Justice will line up before
Judge Low when the charge of
assault against John F. Howard
comes to trial. The complaining wit
is Mrs. Shermanâ a deaf muteâ
the wife of a deaf mute and the
mother of five children, all born under
the curse of perpetual silence. Her
principal witness is a deaf mute and
the defendant is a deaf mute, and the
trial will have to proceed like a hide
ous lesson in calisthenics, for they all
must speak with their fingers and hear
with their eyes. Judge and clerk and
baliff must practice with dumb-bells
before they can take a hand in the tes
timony, and the court reporter may as
well go home, for his art reaches not
to their eloquent but muscular silence.
The assault was made on Mrs. Sher
man in a house on Howard street on
July 3 last. She and a friend, a Mrs.
Colby, and her two children were to
gether in a room when Howard en
tered, and in the presence of those who
were there he seized Mrs. Sherman and
tried to drag her from her chair. Mrs.
Colby ran to her assistance and the
two little ones stood, deprived of the
childish privilege of crying out and
able only to utter the inarticulate gut
tural which is the sole relief of the
dumb. Luckily it was heard, how
ever, and people in an adjoining room
came to the woman's assistance. How
ard escaped.
No one knew where Howard worked
and so it was not until a few days ago
that it was possible to swear to a com
plaint against him. He works In a
lumber yard near the city front.
The Shermans live at 1126 Folsom
Street. It is not a prepossessing place,
but Sherman is a peddler and his in
come even under ordinary circumstan
ces cannot be expected to be very
S. HOMER HENLEY
SEEKS A DIVORCE
POPULAR VOCALIST DESERTED
BY HIS WIFE.
Humors of an Unhappy Union Have
Long Been Going the Rounds
and Occupying the Gossips.
S. Homer Henley, known throughout
the State as the possessor of a rich, effect
ive voice which he has used for years to
advantage, has appeared in court as the
plaintiff In an action at law, with his
wife as defendant.
Mr. Henley wants a divorce. He de
clares he was des.rted and abandoned
by his wife in January of 1897, and on
this fact he bases his right to be again
a single man. It has been rumored for
some time that the popular vocalist and
his wife were not happily mated. Rumor,
however, failed to assume tangible pro
portions until yesterday when the suit
for divorce was tiled.
In the complaint Mr. Henley alleges
that on August 24, 1597, his wife deserted
him. Since then she has lived apart
from him, with the intention of ever so
doing. She had no cause or reason to
desert him, declares Mr. Henley, and did
so against his will and without his con
sent. In consequence he prays that the
bonds of matrimony between himself and
wife be dissolved and that he have such
other relief at the hands of the court as
the circumstances of the case may re
quire.
Got Six Months Each.
W. M. Hooper, who was arrested for so
liciting subscriptions for monthly maga
zines without authority, pleaded guilty
In Judge Mogan's court yesterday and
was sent to the County Jail for six
months. He was convicted in Stockton
about eight years ago on a similar charge.
Alfred Johnston, a young man who is
blossoming out as a pickpocket, was
also sent to the County Jail for six
months by Judge Mogan. He Btole a
purse from the pocket of Mrs. J. A. Mont
gomery of Santa Rosa at Powell and
Market streets Monday night and waa ar
rested by Special Officer Hussey. He
pleaded that it was his first offense, and
the Judge reduced the charge to petty
larceny.
"Anakesis" is an infallible cure for piles.

â¢muchâ and then there are the five
afflicted children. They are bright and
not unhappy looking, but their eyes
follow every movement around them
with a quickness that is uncanny, and
their continued silence makes one wish
they could at least cry. Even the baby
tries to motion with hi* hands, but he
has already found that an attempt to
speak is useless.
Sergeant John Green, the only officer
on the police force who can understand
the sign language of the mutes, visited
the woman yesterday and to him she
deftly spelled out her story. Her
friend Mrs. Colby stood beside her
and added digital corroboratlon.
and the children gazed with wide
open eyes and more open mouths just
as if they were listening. Then the
whole family went down to the Harbor
Police Station with the' officer to iden
tify Howard or to point him out to
the arresting officer. He could not be

The warrant was issued on a com

HE LIVED AND DIED
IN THE TENDERLOIN
THE STRAW THAT IMPELLED
DR. HUBER TO END HIS LIFE.
Believed His Mother Intended to De
prive Him of His Father's
Fortune.
Dr. Charles A. Huber went the pace
that kills, but there was a .Â«had< w upon
the young man out of the ordinary that
impelled him to swallow the contents of
a bottle of carbolic acid about midnight
yesterday. Now, the Coroner having iin
ished his duty, the remains lie in an un
dertaking establishment on Eddy street
awaiting a mother's wishes as to their
disposal.
Huber spent all his leisure in the ten
derloin, a leader in all its excesses. Even
his office and lodgings at 42^ Turk street
were within the limits of the gilded cir
cle, so that day or night, sleeping or
waking-, Huber was seldom without its
pale. Skilled in his profession and enjoy
ing a lucrative practice, still he often
found it necessary to call upon his mother
for funds, so extravagant was his life.
Did Huber enjoy himself to the full?
Friendsâ companions in some of his wild
est carousalsâ say that frequently he
would express his abhorrence of his wast
ed opportunities, and that at least twice
before he attempted self-destruction, but
his nerve failed him at tlie critioal mo
ment. These friends repeat statements
made by Huber at times when he grew
confidential. Their statements touched
upon his home and kindred. His birth
place was Los Angeles, and there his
father amassed a fortune of several hun
dred thousand dollars, leaving It all to
his widow when he died a few years ago.
Huber was given a thorough education
and was well supplied with money by his
mother until recently, when she married
for the second time. Huber bitterly op
posed this marriage, and to his friends he
said that another was to spend the money
his father had accumulated and which
he had intended for his son.
A week ago the young man received a
letter from his mother advising him to be
careful in the selection of his friends and
to lead a righteous iife and place his
trust in the Savior. She mentioned her
poor health, saying she feared her days
on earth were numbered, .and closed with
the statement that he would have to de
pend on his own exertions hereafter, for
she would not be able to send him any
more money. __
After receiving that letter Huber be
came more reckless than ever. Monday
he drank heavily all day. but performed
some dental work for his landlady toward
evening. He seemed cheerful then, and
told of the hard day's work before him
on the morrow. A few hours later he died
â a suicide.
TO WALK THE CARPET.
Policeman Reardon to Appear Before
the Police Commissioners
To-Night.
The case of Robert Smith, charged with
robbing Chin Suey of a purse containing
$13 80 on June 18 last, was concluded in
Judge Low's court yesterday and the
Judge reserved his decision until Satur
day. Meantime the Police Commission
era will have investigated the charge
against Policeman Nell Reardon, the ar
re Captain Gilien of the Mission district
has preferred charges before the Com
missioners against Reardon for unofflcer
like conduct. Last Friday Reardon in
open court stated that Smith on being
arrested told him that Prosecuting At
torney Graham of Judge Joachlmsen's
court and Detectives Fitzgerald and Gra
ham of the Mission had destroyed the
complaint in his case and the case had
been "fixed." It is on account of these
statements that Reardon is to be brought
bffore the Commissioners, as the persons
referred to by Reardon indignantly repu
diate the truth of his assertions, which
Is backed up by the fact that the com
plaint was found.

VOUCHES FOR
NEAD'S GOOD
REPUTATION
lowa Soldier Comes
to the Rescue.
KNEW HIM IN SIOUX CITY
HEARD THE EXHORTEB AT THE
VOLUNTEER MISSION.
Police of That City Are Satisfied the
Unfortunate Couple Are
What They Claim
to Be.
i
There Is a rift In the clouds hanging
ominously over Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Nead,
and through the break there streams a
ray of sunshine, the first that has shown
upon them for many days. There were
developments in the sensational case yes
terday that gave strong confirmation to
their statements and promise to event
ually clear away the terrible charges un
der which they lie, leaving only the scars
and the humiliation of being shamefully
paraded before the public as outcasts or
the lowest type.
The following dispatches from Sioux
City to The Call fully establishes the
identity of Nead and his brother, the
notorious "Billy," and bears out the
suspect's story to the letter:
SIOUX CITY lowa. Oct. 4.â Since the news
, a received here of J. M. Nead's arrest in
San Francisco, the local police have been In
vestigating the records of himself and brother
and have practically concluded that the Call
furnian is. aa he claims, a brother o : the : no
torious -Billy." The two were engaged in
many transactions together, and .? on t f i^iÂ° ,ived
tween them frequently artse while they lived
'â¢â¢Billy" was a short, thick set man with a
dark complexion, and his wife a tall and portly
blonde. Both were middle-aged. Both fam
ilies were old residents here, but whew they
came from before locating in Sioux City one
living here now professes to know. r herein
no divorced Mr.. Nead in town nor can Albert
Worth be found, though he haÃ . t bet . , clt^
until recently at 511 Water street, this city.
He was formerly a letter carrier.
Rev G. W. L- Brown was in Sioux City until
two weeks ago. when he was transferred to the
Prospect-avenue Methodist Episcopal Church at
Concerning J. M. Nead's record in i the city
there la some difference of opinion His ere dl
tors say he deliberately defrauded them of
money due them, and the police regard him
with suspicion, but local members of the sal
vation army say he was unjustly Â«Â»Â«PÂ«Â«"Â£
If he is a clergyman, however, he must na\e
been ordained after leaving Sioux City.
Nead has not claimed to be a clergy
man, merely a licensed, exhorter. Rev. Mr.
Brown, according to Nead, was pastor of
the First Methodist Episcopal Church of
Sioux City up to the time he left there,
the two being firm friends. _Â...
Albert Worth was Mrs. Nnads father,
but Is dead now. Her mother, though,
still resides In Sioux City.
The description of "Billy isead and his
wife, given in the foregoing dispatch, does
not tally in the least with the couple here.
Nead is slender and not yet SO in appear
ance while a blind man could not mis
take Mrs. Nead for the large, blonde,
middle-aged woman "Billy's" wife Is said
to be. Mrs. Nead is slight and very young,
little more than a girl In -appearance, with
clear, delicate features and brown hair.
But the above dispatch was not the only
ray of comfort that came to the Neads
yesterday. During the day Sergeant
Smith of the Fifty-first lowa Regiment,
who was formerly a photographer In
Sioux City, called voluntarily on the cou
ple at their rooms, 125 Turk street. Smith
asked Nead if he remembered him and
being told that he could not, Smith said
he distinctly remembers the Neads when
they were holding volunteer missions in
Sioux City. One Sunday night the ex
photographer heard Mr. Nead speak and
the address made a deep impression upon
him. It was shortly before the departure
of the Neads from Sioux City. Being a
careful observer of people, due to long
experience as a photographer, Smith was
positive the man who stood before him
was the orator he had listened to months
before. He expressed his entire willing
ness to testify In court on their behalf and
to aid them in whatever way he could.
Mr. Nead also received a letter from a
Mr. Day and a telegram from Pierce Rat
lin*, president of the Rescue Mission in
Sioux City. The telegram read:
You may say that you and your wife were
regular attendants ami members of the Metho
dist Episcopal Church here, and were in ex
cellent standing. "Will write.
Mrs. Nead has an aunt living in Santa
Rosa who has been written to, and a reply
is expected which will be used as evidence
of the lady's good reputation. Mr. Nead
Is confident of receiving a statement from.
many people in Sioux City signifying their
willingness to make deposition as to his
good character and work there.
WHISPERING POLICEMEN.
Prosecuting Attorney Reynolds Ut
ters a Timely Protest Against
the Nuisance.
Prosecuting Attorney Reynolds of
Judge Low's court had occasion yester
day to call down a policeman for whis
pering in the ear of the Judge while the
case In which he was Interested was on
the calendar.
The case was that of William Nesbitt
and Julia Nicholas, charged with gTand
larceny in stealing three suits of clothes
and other articles from Berg & Co.
The defendants were arrested by Po
licemen Peshon and Cavanaugh, and just
before the case was called in court yes
terday morning Peshon got the Judge's
ear and began to whisper in it. Reynolds
promptly objected, and said that If
Peshon had anything to say in connec
tion with the case he should do so in open
court.
"This practice," said Reynolds, "of po
licemen whispering in the ear of the
Judge is too common, and it is time It
should be stopped. How would it look
if a prisoner was to be taken out of the
dock and allowed to whisper in the ear
of the Judge? I see no difference bi
tween the arresting officer and the de
fendant in that respect."
After the Prosecuting Attorney had fin
ished his remarks Peshon was glad to
take a back seat.
FLORENCE WILSON ARRIVES.
The Daughter of the Secretary of
Agriculture Is a Visitor in
This City.
Miss Florence Wilson, the daughter of
the Secretary of Agriculture, a member
of the Cabinet, arrived in this city last
night and is at present a guest of her
cousin. Mr. Morehouse. at the Savoy.
Miss Wilson will not remain in this city
for any length of time, but will shortly
leave for Chicago and then to Omaha,
where she will .loin the Presidential
party at the exposition.
Stabbed in a Saloon Row.
Free Meyers, a barkeeper at 52 Ellis
street, was treated at the Receiving Hos
pital last night for a nasty knife wound
in the right shoulder.
He became involved in a quarrel with
D. D. Hartson. a dentist, and William
Willis over a nickel-in-the-slot machine,
and in the mix-up that followed was cut
by Hartson.
Hartson and Willis were arrested by
Officer C. E. Fennell and were booked
upon charges of assault with a deadly
weapon and disturbing the peace, respec
