CONGRESS IN OPEN REVOLT
AGAINST THE PEACE POLICY
CONGRESS HAS
WON ITS FIRST
GREAT VICTORY
That Is the Result of the Day's
Skirmish Between the Legis
lative and the Executive,
NEW YORK, March 28.â Far more
serious than any one anticipated has
the Cuban-Spanish situation grown to
day. Far more threatening beneath
the surface than on the surface is the
aspect of aiiairs in Washington, Mad
rid and Havana, though on the surface
it is bad enough to make men gravely
apprehensive of the developments of the
next twenty-four hours.
This change has come since noon to
day, when President McKinley sent to
Congress his message on the destruc
tion of the Maine. The plan of the
President to have the Maine question
laid away in committee while diplomacy
dealt with the disaster succeeded be
yond the expectations of the adminis
tration. Not a dissenting voice was
raised. Men of all shades of opinion
and political faith acquiesced.
But there the success of the Presi
dent's plan for easing the Cuban fric
tion, so far as he has any plan, halted.
The reception given the President's
message was, perhaps, ominous. In
perfect silence it was received by the
crowded galleries in both houses. Not
a hand was clapped, not a handkerchief
was fluttered. In absolute silence wa>
it accepted by the members of the Sen
ate.
The applause on the floor of the
House seemed to be limited to about
one man in every ten.
It was when the message came to be
discussed that /he popular verdict was
rendered.' Only the staunch and confi
dential friends of the administration
gave it unstinted praise. Compared with
the men who gave outspoken opinions
against it, these were few. Instead of
going forth, as they did when the $*>.
000,000 bill was passed, and calling Mc-
Kinley blessed, the Washington popu
lace in and out of Congress gave vent
to dissatisfaction.
Not far advanced was the afternoon
when it became apparent that Congress
was disappointed in the message and
that immediate and aggressive opposi
tion to his plan for peacefully feeding
the reconcentrados had sprung into
life. The jingoes became rampant.
The war spirit burst forth. The feel
ings of the men who voted money for
relief as well as for war preparations,
so lontf restrained, took the slant in
the direction of blood and gunpowder,
jingo Sentators and jingo Representa
tives declared that the President had
had his say on the Maine matter, and
Congress had restrained from declaring
.war, but it was now time for him to

SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, MARCH 29, 1898 - TWENTY PAGES.
REPORT OF THE
SPANISH COURT
IS MADE PUBLIC
In Direct Contradiction to the
Findings of the American Na
val Officers on the Maine,
WASHINGTON, March 28.â A
full synopsis of the report of the
Spanish naval commission which in
vestigated the destruction of the
battleship Maine is here given by
the Associated Press. It is taken
from a copy of the original report,
which is now on its way here from
Havana, the synopsis being cabled
in the meantime, and to-day placed
in the hands of this Government.
The conclusions are directly opposite
to those in the report of the Court of
Inquiry submitted to Congress to
day. The synopsis is as follows:
"The report contains declarations
made by ocular witnesses and ex
perts. From these statements it de
duces and proves the absence of all
those attendant circumstances which
are invariably present on the occa
sion of the explosion of a torpedo.
"The evidence of witnesses com
paratively close to the Maine at the
moment is to the effect that only
one explosion occurred; that no col
umn of water was thrown into the
air; that no shock to the side of the
nearest vessel was felt, nor on land
was any vibration noticed, and that
no dead fish were found.
"The evidence of the senior pilot
of the harbor states that there is
abundance of fish in the harbor, and
this is corroborated by other wit
nesses. The assistant engineer of
works states that after explosions
made during the execution of works
in the harbor he has always found
dead fish.
"The divers were unable to ex
amine the bottom of the ' Maine,
which was buried in the mud, but a
careful examination of the sides of
the vessel, the rents and breaks,
which all point outward, shows with
out a doubt that the explosion was
from the inside.
"A minute examination of the
bottom of the harbor around the ves
sel shows absolutely no sign of the
action of a torpedo and the fiscal
(judge-advocate) of the commission
can find no precedent for the explo
sion of the storage magazine of the
vessel by a torpedo.
"The report makes clear that ow
ing to the special nature of the pro
ceedings followed and the absolute
respect shown for the extraterritor
ialidad of the Maine, the commission
has been prevented from making such
an examination of the inside of the
vessel as would determine even the
LONDON, March 28.â The Ma
drid correspondent of the Daily
Mail gives a version of the ne
gotiations between United States
Minister Woodford and the Span
ish Cabinet last week differing
somewhat from that siven yes
terday by the Standard's Ma
drid correspondent. He says:
"The, note which General
Woodford presented on Wednes
day was of a comminatory na
ture. It demanded that Spain
put an end to the war in Cuba
immediately, recapitulating the
damage to American interests
and further hinting that the war
was a danger to the public health
of the United States, the contin
ual smuggling between the
coasts of Cuba and Florida be
ing the means of conveying the
yellow fever.
"Spain's reply was energetic.
It declares that the war would
have ended long ago but for the
material and moral help and
support the rebels were contin
ually receiving from the United
States. The Spanish note com
plains of the policy followed by
the United States in demanding
from Spain the termination of
a war which the United
States were virtually maintain
ing by the presence of a squad
ron in the neighborhood of Cuba
and by organizing succor for the
reconcentrados in a manner that
would be offensive to any nation,
as well as by keeping in Havana
a consul who is publicly the
agent and representative of the
rebels.
hypothesis of the internal origin of
the accident. This is to be attribut
ed to the regretable refusal to per
mit necessary co-operation of the
Spanish commission, both with the
commander and crew of the Maine,
and the different American officials
commissioned to investigate the
cause of the accident, and later on
with those employed on salvage
work
"The report finishes by stating
that an examination of the inside
and outside of the Maine as soon as
such examination may be possible,
as also of the bottom where the ves
sel rests, will prove that, supposing
that the remains (of the wreck) be
not totally or partially altered in
the process of extrication the explo
sion was undoubtedly due to some in
terior cause."
THE PRESIDENT IS
CALLED TO CONFRONT
A GRAVE SITUATION
Report of the Maine Court of Inquiry
Made Public With a Message Too
Pleasing to Premier Sagasta.
THE FULL REPORT OF
THE NAVAL COURT
OF INQUIRY.
WASHINGTON, March 28.â The following is the full text of
I the report of the Court of Inquiry:
TJnited States Steamship lowa, First-rate.
KEY WEST, Florida, Monday, March 21, 1898.
* After a full and mature consideration of all the testimony
* before it, the court finds as follows:
* Firstâ That the United States battleship Maine arrived in the
* Harbor of Havana, Cuba, on the 21st day of January, 1898, and
* was taken to buoy No. 4, in from five and a half to six fathoms of
* water, by the regular Government pilot.
* The United States Consul-General had notified the authorities
* at that place the previous evening of the intended arrival of the
* Maine.
Secondâ The state of discipline on board the Maine was excel
lent, and all orders and regulations in regard to the care and safe
ty of the ship were strictly carried out. All ammunition was stowed
away in accordance with instructions, and proper care was taken
whenever ammunition was handled. Nothing was stored in any
* one of the magazines or shell rooms which was not permitted to
* be stowed there. The magazines and shell rooms were always
* locked after having been open; and after the destruction of the
* Maine the keys were found in their proper place in the captain's
* cabin, everything having been reported secure that evening at 8
* o'clock. The temperatures of the magazines and shell rooms were
* taken daily and reported. The only magazine which had an undue
* amount of heat was the after ten-inch magazine, and that did not
* explode at the time the Maine was destroyed. The torpedo war
* heads were all stowed in the after part of the ship under the ward
* room, and neither caused nor participated in the destruction of the
* Maine. The dry gun cotton primers and detonators were stowed
* in the cabin aft and remote from the scene of the explosion.
The waste was carefully looked after on board the Maine to
* obviate danger. Special orders in regard to this had been
given by the commanding ofiicer. Varnishes, dryers, alcohol and
other combustibles of this nature were stowed on or above the main
Â£ deck, and could not have had anything to do with the destruction
* of the Maine.
* The medical stores were stowed aft under the ward room and
* remote from the scene of the explosion. No dangerous stores of
* any kind were stowed below in any of the other store rooms.
* The coal bunkers were inspected. Of those bunkers adioin
ing the forward magazines and shell rooms, four were empty,
* namely: 83, 84, 85, 86. Als had been used that date, and Al6
* was full of New Biver coal. This coal had been carefully inspected
* before receiving it on board. The bunker in which it was stored
* was accessible on three sides at all times, and the fourth side at
* this time on account of bunkers B4 and B6 being empty. This
* bunker, Al6, had been inspected that day by the engineer officer
* on duty. The fire alarms in the bunkers were in working order,
* and there had never been a case of spontaneous combustion of coal
on board the Maine.
The two after boilers of the ship were in use at the time of
* the disaster, but for auxiliary purposes only, with a comparatively
* low pressure of steam, and being tended by a reliable watch. These
* boilers could not have caused the explosion of the ship. The for
* ward boilers of the ship have since been found by the divers, and
* are in a fair condition.
* On the night of the destruction of the Maine, everything had
* been reported secure for the night at 8 o'clock by reliable persons,
* through proper authorities, to the commanding ofi&cer. At the time
* the Maine was destroyed, the ship was quiet, and, therefore, the
* least liable to accident caused by movements from those on board.
EXPLOSIONS.
Thirdâ The destruction of the Maine occurred at 9:40 p. m.,
on the 15th day of February, 1898, in the harbor of Havana, Cuba,
being at the time moored on the very same buoy to which she had
been taken upon her arrival.
There were two explosions of a distinctly different character,
with a very short, but distinct, interval between them, and the for
ward part of the ship was lifted to a marked degree at the time of
the first explosion. The first explosion was more in the nature of
a report, like that of a gun, while the second explosion was more
open, prolonged and of a greater volume. The second explosion
was, in the opinion of the court, caused by the partial explosion of
two' or more of the forward magazines of the Maine.
CONDITION OF THE WRECK.
Fourthâ The evidence bearing on this, being principally ob
tained from divers, did not enable the court to form a definite con
clusion as to the condition of the wreck, although it was estab
lished that the after part of the ship was practically intact, and
sank in that condition a very few minutes after the destruction of
the forward part.
The following facts in regard to the forward part of the ship
are however, established by the testimony. That portion of the
protective deck which extends from about frame thirty to about
frame forty-one, was blown up aft and over to port. The main deck,
from about irame thirty to about frame forty-one, was blown up
aft and slightly over to starboard, folding the forward part of the
middle superstructure over and on top of the floor part. This was
in the opinion of the court, caused by the partial explosion of two or
more of the forward magazines of the Maine.
Fifthâ At frame fifteen, the outer shell of the ship, from a
point eleven and one-half feet from the middle line of the ship and
six feet above the keel when in its normal position, has been forced
up so as to be about four feet above the surface of the water; there
fore about thirty-four feet above where it would be had the ship
sunk uninjured. The outside bottom plating is bent into a reversed
"V" shape, the after wing of which, about fifteen feet broad and thir

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, D. C, March 28.
The Republicans of the House
are in open revolt and the indica
tions are that when the resolution
appropriating $500,000 for the re
lief of the Cubans is reported the
recalcitrants will seek to amend it
by tacking on a rider recognizing
the belligerent rights of the
Cubans. They may even go so
far as to attempt recognition of the
independence of Cuba.
It is the general expectation that
the resolution will not be consid
ered until Wednesday, although
Representative Hopkins of Illinois,
leader of the rebellious Repub
licans in the House, said to the
Call correspondent to-night that
the explosion might take place to
morrow. ,
Hopkins was at one time prom
inently mentioned as a candidate
to oppose Reed for the Speaker
ship, and has since then been re
garded as the leader of those Re
publicans who are inclined to rebel
against Reed's dictatorial and auto
cratic rulings. Therefore the in
terview with Mr. Hopkins to-night,
after his talk with a number of
leading Republicans, is significant.
"There's a 'mine' under the
House chamber," said he, "and
as I view the situation all we
have to do is to touch the button
and Czar Reed's arbitrary policy
will be blown to atoms. The ex
pectation is that on to-morrow or
Wednesday the Committee on
Rules will bring in a resolution for

FAKE JOURNALS
THROW BROKERS
INTO A PANIC
false Stories of Peace Cause th>e
Bears of Wall Street to
Hunt Wildly for Cover.
NEW YORK, March 28.â Following the publication of an article
in the Evening Sun to-day to the effect that the President has a
plan for a settlement of the controversy with Spain by a declaration
of six months' armistice between Spain and Cuba, this announcement
being followed a moment later by the glaring announcement in the
Evening Journal which used the Evening Sun's dispatches that Spain
had actually acceded to the President's plan, that armistice would be
declared and that peace was at hand, there was one of the biggest bear
panics that have ever been witnessed in the history of the Stock Ex
change, with dealings on a colossal scale and running up to figures
that have been exceeded only on one or two occasions.
The stories published by the two newspapers appear to have been
absolutely false, and if half of what has come to the ears of well-in
formed men in Wall street is true the original story was concerted
with a view to bringing about a great coup In the stock market.
According to the sources from which the details of the supposed plot
emanated, the newspapers that printed the fake to-day possibly did
not know that it was created for stock-jobbing purposes, but that
these newspapers, in their zeal to get ahead of their contemporaries,
published this story without taking pains to verify it seems to be be
yond doubt. From all that can be ascertained, the armistice story
was concocted right here in New York and its originators intended that
it should be used in connection with a raid on the shorts.
Some well-known brokers said to-day that they knew as long ago
as Friday that there was to be a great demonstration of some kind on
the Stock Exchange to-day. There had been a considerable rise in
prices during the early morning session, a continuation of the raid on
the shorts that was begun on Saturday and apparently with no other
design than a desire of the stronger interests to make the small fry
cover their contracts.
But when the so-called news about the armistice between Spain
and the insurgents came out, and it was boldly announced by the
Evening Journal and one of Wall street's news agencies that peace was
at hand, the bears climbed over one another in their terror to make
good their contracts, and prices jumped up from four to six points,
while some of the specialties recorded sains of as much as eleven
points.
After gains of 11% points had been recorded in Metropolitan street
railway, 9 in sugar, 6*4 in St. Paul, 6% in Burlington, 5% in Rock Is
land, T^j. in Manhattan, 6^ in Union Pacific, preferred, and correspond
ing advances in many other stocks, and after the exchange closed with
a recession of a quarter from the highest prices of the day, the street
was still in the dark as to the exact state of the Cuban situation, al
though it was known that the President had reached no understand
ing with Spain and no armistice had been agreed to.
It was only late in the day that it dawned upon the financial
community that it had been humbugged in one of the worst ways on
record. Glancing at the actual course of the market to-day, out of
total transactions of 855.006 shares, four stocks made up one-half of
the total. These were sugar, 180,000 shares; St. Paul, 109,000; Burling
ton, 90,000. and Union Pacific, 50,000. This is one of the biggest day's
dealings that ever occurred in any of these stocks. As thousands of
shares were not recorded, it is probable that the total reached a mil
lion.
consideration of the bill making
the relief appropriation asked for
by the President. A motion will
then be made for the previous
question and this will be opposed.
The opposition will, 1 think, be
successful in this, for many Re
\ publicans will join the Democrats.
If the motion for the previous ques
tion is defeated it will be then in
order to submit amendments, and
one of them will be for the recog
nition of the Cubans as belliger
ents, or perhaps a recognition of
the independence cf Cuba. A
point of order will likely be made
that this is not germain and it is
expected that Speaker Reed will
sustain this point. An appeal will
then be taken from his rul
ing, and if Speaker Reed
recognizes this right of appeal
(as he should) the House will vote
by a big majority not to sustain
him. My opinion is that unless
the Speaker arbitrarily refuses to
recognize the right of appeal the
House will succeed in attaching a
rider to the appropriation bill
recognizing Cuban independence.
If such action is taken the Senate
will follow suit."
"What would be the effect of
such action?" Mr. Hopkins was
asked.
"War," he replied, "and if the
President is wise he will accept
the inevitable and dispatch our
war vessels to head off the torpedo
fleet before it can reach Havana
harbor."
But, notwithstanding the op
timistic Congressman Hopkins,
there is another side to the ques
tion. The President is fully aware
of the temper of Congress and
realizes the danger. For this
reason he may delay sending his
message until the Congressmen
have cooled off. The President
held a conference to-night with
several Cabinet members and in
timate friends, and the situation
was discussed. What conclusion
was reached could not be ascer
tained, although it is believed that
the President will withhold his
message until Wednesday, at any
rate; and perhaps it may be in
definitely postponed.
There is an additional reason
for that. The Call correspondent
learns that at 4 o'clock this after
noon a cablegram was received
from United States Minister Wood
ford at Madrid conveying to this
Government the satisfaction with
which President McKinley's mod
erate message to Congress to-day
was regarded by the Spanish
Ministry. The President and his
Cabinet are apprehensive that
the publication of this felicitous
cablegram may add fuel to the flames.
Therefore, as stated above, the proba
bilities are that he will thwart the
plans of thÂ« rebels in the House by
I withholding his message until its ter
n pei - has cooled. If he does not do so,
the House is almost certain to- take
radical action. The button will be
pressed and there will be nothing left
of President McKinley's policy of
"peaceful intervention."
Mr. Quigg (R.) of New York, a mem
ber of the Foreign Affairs Committee,
said to-night: "The facts disclosed in
the message are those and only those
which have been anticipated and their
effect upon the public feeling is natur
ally discounted. The President states
them clearly and defines a course which
j becomes the Chief Magistrate of a so
ber, right-Intending and self-confident
people. He is acting with good judg
ment and I, as a Representative, pro
pose to sustain him. War is hideous and
should be resorted to only when no
other course is possible in justice and
self-respect."
Mr. Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio said he
had no comment to make on the mes
sage.
Mr. Livingston (D.) of Georgia: "The
message reads like an apology."
Mr. McMillin (D.) of Tennessee: "The !
message is thoroughly non-committal
and does not acquaint Congress with the
policy of the administration. From the
fact that the President simply trans- !
mits the findings of the board and no
tifies us that these have been laid be
fore the Spanish Government I Judge !
that we are expected to do nothing j
until Spain is heard from."
Representative Cummings of New j
York, a member of the Naval Commit
tee â In my opinion the blowing up of
the Maine ought to be considered one
of the main factors in the case. The |
j Spaniards are proverbial for their
trickery. Their policy is one of delay.
By shunning the issue made by the
I blowing up of the Maine they concen
trate evidence on the issue of feeding
their own starving people. If I under
stand the President the Spaniards are
unwilling that we should take it upon
ourselves to feed these people, and if
they finally agree to allow us to do so
it will be as a special favor to us and re
move all pretext for interference. I
have no comment to make. The Ameri
can people will make their own com
ment and make it so loud that even the
deaf will hear them.
Charles A. Russell of Connecticut, a
member of the Ways and Means Com-
I mlttee â The President's message trans- j
mitting the report and evidence of
the Maine board of inquiry was calm
and dispassionate, befitting the gravity
of the subject. Congress and the coun
try ought to receive this message and
the report as a forerunner of some ac
tion for two reasons: First, exhaust
every effort to preserve peace with
honor to ourselves and justice to Cuba;
I and second, to prepare most effectively
i for war.
Representative Babcock (R.) of Wis
consin, chairman of the Republican
Congressional Committee â The Presi
dent has treated the matter with great
forbearance and has been very con
servative in his action.
Representative Warner (R.) of 1111
! nois â The report settles the question
beyond cavil that the Maine was blown
up by a mine in Spanish waters. The
time for talking on our part has passed.
We should now act.
Representative Foos (R.) of Illinois,
a member of the Naval Affairs Com
i mittee: "The report fails to fix the
j responsibility, but It will be difficult
Ito make the Americans believe that
] Spain did not have something to do
I with It. If armed intervention is to
: take place it should be done on the
! broad ground of humanity."
Representative Dockery (D.): "I have
i not read the findings of the Court of
i Inquiry or the accompanying evidence
I and, therefore, my opinion is based
: solely upon the President's message. I
I confess to a deep disappointment at
I its tenor. Doubtless the language of
i diplomacy calls for respectful phrases,
; but the facts already known to the
i country in relation to the Maine do not,
; it seems to me, admit of any depart
; ure from a strict and simple recital,
! devoid of coloring either way. I do
not know the contemplated policy of
I the administration, but it may as well
be understood now as later that the
people of the United States win dis
I approve of any attempted settlement

! payment or guarantee of bonds or leav

island, or any action resulting in the

Frame eighty, the vertical keel, is broken in two, and the flat
keel bent into an angle similar to the angle formed by outside bot
tom plating. This break is now about six feet below the surface of
the water and about thirty feet above its normal position. In the
opinion of the court this effect could have been produced only by
the explosion of a mine situated under the bottom of the ship at
about frame eighteen, and somewhat on the port side of the ship.
6. The court finds that the loss of the Maine on the
occasion named was not In any respect due to fault or
negligence on the part of any of the officers or members
of the crew of said vessel.
7. In the opinion of the court the Maine was destroyed
by the explosion of a submarine mine, which caused the
partial explosion of two or more of her forward magazines.
8. The court has been unable to obtain evidence fixing
the responsibility of the destruction of the Maine upon
any person or persons.

COMMENT OF
THE PRESS
Abroad President Mc-
Kinley Is Applauded
as a Statesman.
London Newspapers Say Eng
land Needs Uncle Sam's
Support in the Far East.
Leading Journals in This Country
Are Not Unanimous in Criticiz
ing the Message.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 29.â The Times says:
â¢ President McKinley's message is tem
perate and contains nothing that ought
to wound the feelings of the most sus
ceptible Spaniard. It has in no way ver
ified the anticipation that he would throw
down the gauntlet. This is a distinct
gain. It must be admitted, with every
desire to excuse Spain's reluctance to in
creased pressure, that we cannot refuse
our sympathy to the American people. If
such an incident as the Maine's destruc
tion had happened to us, it would have
been difficult even for Englishmen to
preserve their boasted calm. We share
the grief at the loss of the noble vessel
and her crew and we admire the pati
ence and reserve of a democratic govern
ment under provocation and public ex
citement. The sentiments of England for
America, which we hope are reciprocated,
are expressed in the laureate's cordial
verses."
The Standard says: "With a report so
inconclusive and a Presidential message
so cordial toward Spain, the latter should
be able to make suitable amends. There
fore war on that issue need not be ap
prehended. Still, the situation is exceed
ingly grave. The danger is not passed.
Let the United States continue in their
patient mood. Their interests in Cuba are
not great enough to make it worth their
while to break t-e peace of the world."
BERLIN, March 28.â The Vossische Zei
tung says: "The most dangerous is the
second demand, namely, under the cloak
of humanltarianism to aim at direct in
terference in Cuba. The Washington
Government in that goes beyond limits.
Spain can make no concessions without
humiliation and loss of dignity, but if
America insists upon these demands
swords will be brought out of their scab
bards."
The Tageblatt remarks: "The American
jingoes underrate the injuries which a
war will bring upon America."
The Boersen Courier says; "With an
earnest desire that an understanding may
be reached, even without mediation, dip
lomatic circles still count on this as being
the best solution so long as neither one
nor the other has taken the irredeemable
step."
The Berliner Post in its comments says:
"President McKinley will doubtless do
everything to avert war, but popular sen
timent may decide to the contrary."
SENTIMENT IN
THIS COUNTRY.
What the Leading Papers of the East
Have to Say About the
Message.
NEW YORK, March 2S.â The morning
press will comment as follows on the
President's message to-morrow:
The Herald says: Spain must under
stand from diplomatic and other develop
ments of the last few days that she
stands at the parting of the ways. So far
Christian people are concerned there is no
wish for war. Peace was never more
requisite. The situation in Cuba is no
longer war or insurrection, nor even an
outbreak. It has degenerated into mas-
sacre and starvation. There must be
humane intervention. Humanity Imposes
the mandate and will applaud the mis
sion. From this policy there will be
neither departure nor appeal. Spain
must decide."
The World says: "The President's mes
sage is inadequate, a disappointing and
chilling document. This trust in Spanish
'Justice' and 'honor' cannot have been
drawn from the history of Spain nor
from any manifestation of Spanish
character in Cuba. But what has the
President to say as to the 'course of ac
tion' required by our Government and
reparation demanded by our sense of
honor and justice? Why is the initiative
left to Spain? Is this the way that Eng
land proceeded at Alexandria or Germany
at Hayti? Is this what any first-class
European power would do in like circum
stances? There is a time to stop delib
erating and proceed to action. This time
has come in the Spanish-Cuban crisis."
The Tribune says: "It is the voice of
patriotism and of statesmanship. The
President sees that the case is one to be
dealt with diplomatically until either it
is satisfactorily settled or the resources
of diplomacy are exhausted. Those who
are in the vast majority believe that the
destruction of one ship and of hundreds
of lives can be atoned for In some better
way than the destruction of other ships
and hundreds or thousands of other
lives."
The Journal says: That is absolutely all
the comment the President has to make
upon an act of murderous treachery that
stands alone in modern history. He has
less to say about the destruction of an
American battle-ship and the murder of
266 American sailors than he would say
about a proposition to fill Potomac flats.
He humbly holds out his hat at Spain
and trusts that she will drop into it some
thing satisfactory to us or at least to her
self. And this is what we have been arm
ing for so ostentatiously in the sight of an
admiring world. It is for this we have
been scouring the military markets of
Europe and painting our warships a
greenish gray.

HAVANA, March 28.â The Bache left
Havana for Key est at 4 p. m. with
Captain Chadwick and Captain Cowles,
who, with Lieutenant-Commander
Wainwright, were named to decide
whether it was desirable to proceed
further with the work of wrecking the
Maine. The committee has secured the
necessary information, and while work
on the wreck is going on and will be
continued, the plan first decided upon,
which included the raising of every
portion of tliA phip possible, has been
Abandoned. W> sh^t the wreckers and
divers will continue work for the pres
ent and recover such guns and material
as are still valuable enough to pay the
heavy cost of getting them up. The
Fern remains, but work will proceed
slowly in the absence of permission to
use dynamite. It is the opinion of both
naval officers and wreckers that the
commission's decision will mean little
more work to b> done, the ten-inch
guns may be raised, but even those
may be abandoned because of the dif
ficulty of reaching and raising them.
The task of the divers is perilous in
the extreme, and as the top hamper
cannot be cut away by dynamite lives
might be sacrificed, and are How hourly
endangered by submarine caves. The
tug Underwriter is expected to-night
with a barge to carry off some of the
material recovered and not taken by
the Mangrove and Bache. The wreck
ers are not at ai anxious to continue
work. They feel anxiety regarding the
continued stay in these waters and say
the wreck will long resist th&ir efforts
as dynamite is barred.
Deep interest is felt here in the news
received to-day from the United States.
La Lucha, in an editorial, says: "The
United States note to Spain demanding
that a date be fixed to end hostilities
is simply a dec -ration of war. It was
not issued until after the finding of the
United States Court of Inquiry had
been received which finding is without
scientific basis ar. 1 is open to question
even upon the part of the most pre
judiced. President McKinley has been
forced by jingo opinion and the sensa
tional press to close the debate on the
question and to shield Captain Sigsbee,
who is one of the most popular officers
in the navy. It was needless to send
the Maine to Havana, as American in
terests were amply protected by Gen
eral Lee and also by the Cuban Govern
ment, the latter often acting to its dis
advantage and in favor of American
interests."
Continuing, La Lucha remarks: "It
is well for Spain to know at last the
real purpose of money-loving Ameri
cans. Spain now knows what to ex
pect and how to act."
La Lucha then warns the United
States that if she expects to have all
her own way In Cuba "she can only do
so with cannon." In conclusion La
Lucha says: "The United States is
rich and Spain Is poor, but the Yankees
may find Spain with a good portion of
American money."
La Lucha also quotes General Lee as
denying the report published in Mad
rid to the effect that he was connected
with an alleged syndicate whose pur
pose is said to be the purchase of
Cuba. The Consul-General says, ac
cording to La Lucha, that he attends
only to the Interests of Americans,
never mixes wth outside matters and
never had any communications with
the insurgents, except when he tried
to save the life of the late Lieutenant-
Colonel Ruiz, which step was taken
with the consent of Captain-General
Blanco. In conclusion General Lee is
quoted as expressing the hope that
peace will prevail and that all ques
tions in dispute will be arranged In the
interests of both nations. About 700
troops have arrived here to-day from
Spain. â¢_â

about 60.000 pounds. She was offered

NEW YORK, March 28.â A New Ha

THE PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE TALKS
ONLY OF PEACE
Submits the Report of the Court
of Inquiry and Leaves the .
Rest to Spain's Honor.
WASHINGTON, March 28.â The
President to-day sent the following mes
sage to Congress:
To the Congress of the United States:
For some time prior to the visit of the
Maine to Havana harbor our Consular
representatives pointed out the advan
tages to follow a visit of national ships
to the Cuban waters, in accustomingthe
residents to the presence of our flag as
the symbol of good will and of our
ships in the fulfillment of the mission
of protection to American interests,
even though no immediate need there
for might exist.
Accordingly, on the 25th of January
last, after a conference with the Span
ish Minister, in which the renewal of
visits of our war vessels to Spanish
waters was discussed and accepted, the
peninsula authorities at Havana were
advised of the purpose of this Govern
ment to resume friendly visits at Cuban
ports, and with that view the Maine
would forthwith call at the port of Hay-
ana. This announcement was received
by the Spanish Government with ap
preciation of the friendly character of
the visit of the Maine and with notifi
cation of the intention to return the
courtesy by sending Spanish ships to
the principal ports of the United States.
Meanwhile the Maine entered the port
of Havana on the 25th of January, her
arrival being marked with no special
incident besides the exchange of cus
tomary salutes and ceremonial visits.
The Maine continued in the harbor
of Havana during the three weeks fol
lowing her arrival. No appreciable ex
citement attended her stay; on the
contrary, a feeling of relief and con
fidence followed the resumption of the
long interrupted friendly intercourse.
So noticeable was this immediate effect
of her visit that the Consul-General
strongly urged that the presence of our
ships in Cuban waters should be kept
up by retaining the Maine at Havana:
or, in the event of her recall, by send
ing another vessel there to take her
place.
At forty minutes past 9 o'clock in the
evening of the 15th of February, the
Maine was destroyed by an explosion,
by which the entire forward part of the
ship was utterly wreckt.l. In this catas
trophe two oucers and 260 of her crew
perished, those who were not killed
outright by her explosion being penned
between decks by the tangle of wreck
age and drowned by the immediate
sinking of the hull. Prompt assistance
was rendered by the neighboring: ves
sels anchored in the harbor, aid beine
especially given by the boats of the
Spanish cruiser Alfonso XII and the
Ward line steamer City of Washing
ton, which lay not far distant. The
wounded were generously cared for by
the authorities of Havana, the hospitals
being freely opened to them, while the
earliest recovered bodies of the dead
were interred by the municipality in the
public cemetery of the city. Tributes
of grief and sympathy were offered
from all official quarter of the island.
The appalling calamity fell upon the
oeople of our country with crushing
force, and for a brief tirre an intense
excitement prevailed, which in a com
munity less just and self-controlled
than ours must have led to hasty acts
of blind resentment. This spirit, how
ever, soon gave way to the calmer pro
cesses of reason and to the resolve to
investigate the facts and await the ma
terial proof before forming a judgment
as to the cause, the resoonsibility, and.
if the facts waranted, the remedy due.
This course necessarily recommended
itself from the outset to the executive,
for only in the light of a dispassionately
ascertained certainty could it determine
the nature and measure of its full duty
in the matter.
The usual procedure was followed,
as in all cases of casualty or disaster
to national vessels of any r aritime
state. A Naval Court of Inquiry was
at once organized, composed of officers
well qualified by rank and practical ex
perience to discharge the onerous duty
imposed upon them: and by a strong
force of wreckers and divers the court
proceeded to make a thorough investi
gation on the spot, employing every
available means for the impartial and
exact determination of the causes of the
explosion. Its operations have been
conducted with the utmost deliberation
and judgment, and, while independently
pursued, no source of information was
neglected, and the fullest opoortunitv
was allowed for a simultaneous inves
tigation by the Spanish authorities.
The finding of the Court of Inquiry
was reached, after twenty-three days of
continuous labor, on the 2ist of March,
and. having been approved on the 226.
by the commander-in-chief of the Unit
ed States naval force on the North At
lantic station, was transmitted to the
executive. It is herewith laid before
the Congress, together with the volum
inous testimony taken before the court.
Its purport in brief is as follows:
When the Maine arrived at Havana
she was conducted by the regular Gov
ernment pilot to buoy No. 4, to which
she was moored in from five and a half
to six fathoms of water.
The state of discipline on board and
the condition of her magazines, coal
bunkers and storage compartments are
passed in review, with the conclusion
that excellent order prevailed and that
no indication of any cause for an in
ternal explosion existed in any quarter.
The facsimile â  -Yiy^ y/^TT^ST* to on every wrapper
Â«ignaturÂ« of <J***ffi&cZM <* CASTOKIA.
At 8 o'clock in the evening on Feb
ruary 15 everything had been reported
secure and all about was quiet. At
forty minutes past 9 o'clock the vessel
was suddenly destroyed.
There were two distinct explosions,
with a brief interval between them. The
first lifted the forward part of the ship
very perceptibly; the second, which was
more prolonged, is attributed by the
court to the partial explosion of two or
more of the forward magazines.
The evidence of the divers estab
lishes that the after part of the ship
was practically intact and sank in that
condition within a very few minutes
of the explosion. The forward part was
completely demolished. Upon the evi
dence of concurrent external cause the
finding of the court is as follows:
At frame 17, the outer shell of the
ship, from a roint eleven and one half
feet from the middle line of the ship
and six feet above the keel when in its
normal position, had been forced up so
as to be about four feet above the sur
face of the water; therefore, about
about fifteen feet broad and thirty-two
be had she sunk uninjured. The out
side bottom plating is bent into a re
versed V shape, the after wing ofwhich,
about fifteen feet broad and thirty-two
feet in length (from frame 17 to frame
25), is doubled back upon itself against
the continuation of the same plating
extending forward. At frame 18 the
vertical keel is broken in two and keel
bent into an angle similar to the angle
formed for the outside plates. This
break is about six feet below the sur
face of the water and about thirty feet
above its normal position. In the opin
ion of the court this effect could have
been produced only by the explosion of
a mine situated under the bottom of
the ship, at about frame 18 and some
what on the port side of the ship.
The conclusions of the court are:
That the loss of the Maine was not in
any way due to the fault or negligence
on the part of any of the officers or
members of her crew.
That the ship was destroyed by the
explosion of a submarine mine, which
caused the partial explosion of two or
more of her forward magazines; and
that ro evidence has been obtainable
fixing the responsibility for the destruc
tion of the Maine upon any person or
persons.
I have directed that the finding of the
Court of I-nquiry and the views of this
Government thereon be communicated
to the Government of her Majesty the
â Queen, and I do not permit myself to
doubt that the sense of justice of the
Spanish nation will dictate a course of
action suggested by honor and the
friendly relations of the two Govern
ments.
It is the duty of the executive to ad
vise Congress of the result, and in the
meantime deliberate consideration 15
invoked.

WON ITS FIRST
GREAT VICTORY
Continued from First Page.
as to provoke Spain to armed resist
ance.
Not very much time was required to
make it clear that a serious change had
come over the situation. The Presi
dent's desire has been to have a united
Congress at his back in all the nego
tiations. Here was a break. It is plain
that the jingoes had brought on serious
complications. Quickly the news trav
eled to the White House, and it had
the effect of disturbing the President
seriously. Unless the attitude of Con
gress could be changed the whole fab
ric of the President's aspirations would
come tumbling down. The President's
dream of a united Congress was surely
dispelled. He had not been anticipat
ing opposition to the sending of relief
without warlike conditions, and a prop
osition had been laid before him by the
peaceful financiers of New York. Bos
ton and Philadelphia, looking to the
raising of the money by private sub
scription. This would accomplish the
President's humanitarian desires, but
what effect would it have on the coun
try, and what effect would it have on
Spain?
The President to-night is consulting
with members of Congress seeking to
smooth out the tangle. He has been
in conference with Allison, Gorman,
Hanna and Aldrich. Representatives
have called. It is thought that Reed
can fight the appropriation through the
House without a warlike order being
put in. The Speaker was evidently pre
paring for the fray to-day when to at
tend the late Representative Simpkins'
funeral he appointed four members of
the Foreign Affairs Committee. Berry
of Kentucky, Elliott of Massachusetts.
Cousins of lowa and Newlands of Ne
vada. This will take them away from
the House for a few days.
The State Department's instructions
to Minister Woodford were to say that
the United States would gladly encour
age any plan which would end the Cu
ban war. General Wpodford was in
structed to get tl^ best offer the Span
ish Government iould make, and it
would be considered.
There are indications here that the
Republic of Franc, in pursuance of
the policy outlined^ the speech of M.
Hanotaux. Minister of Foreign Affairs,
in the Chamber of Deputies last Satur
day, is soon to apptir with an offer of
mediation on the whole general sub
ject of Cuba and the ilainc.
A movement in ths direction is ex
pected daily. I find a sentiment in the
Cabinet is not entirel) favorable to the
mediation of any Euupean power.
There are hints, too, of other moves
on the international cfcss board. The
eyes of the diplomats d the world are
watching Austria as wll as France.
Some significance was aso attached to
a call of Sir Julian Pauiceiote on the
Secretary of State to-day I must add
here that Senators Gormai and Allison
were sent for by the President because
they are the chairmen respectively of
the Democratic and Repubican caucus
committees. The President wanted to
know of the Senators whether Congress
could not be induced to grant an ap
propriation without conditions which
might bring on trouble. He wis frank
ly told that Congress had passed be
yond control of any one who wanted
to act on Cuba in any way short of ac
tual intervention. The Presidert said
Spain had suggested an armistice unt:Â«
October.
The Senators told him that ererv
body must see that would be d1"?*1?d 1 "?* 1 ?
against the interests of the United
States. An armistice would not be ac
cepted by the Cubans. When October
comes, the need of intervention might
be more urgent than now, and by that
time Spain would have a cordon of war
ships around the island to keep the
United States out.
The President visibly weakened when
this was said to him. When the Sena
tors told him that he roust also insist
that the reconcentrados be released and
returned to their homes, he said he
would be in favor of that
Thus at midnight it looks aÂ» though
Congress had won in the first engage
ment with the President.

POWER.
The feeling of power is as splendid a one
as there is in the world. When you know
that you are equal to any task that may be
placed before you, you cannot but feel proud.
But how few men there are in the different
stations of life who are full of it. Much
fewer than you would imagine. Loss of
strength is caused in men from causes too
numerous to mention. Over-exertion is one
of the commonest. An individual, instead of
exercising all of his functions in equal pro-
portion, uses some to excess. And as a mat-
ter of consequence he begins to get weak.
But there is at least one way in which he
may recover his strength. It is by using the
"Hudyan" treatment. If he does he will
pass through the following stages :
V : The power is Coins! fast. ' â  v*
X Prematureness always. . *â *
O ' Loss stopped. w
V Confidence returns. w
''â '. Health and full vigor again. -Â«-'
But beware. "Hudyan" can be had on\\
from Hudsonian doctors, and it is the one
thing that will restore to you your full and
perfect health. If you have abused your
rights granted you by Nature do not be dis-
couraged. "Hudyan" will give you your
power back. Send for free circulars and
testimonials showing what it has done for
20,000 other sufferers. You can have medi-
cal advice free, too, if you will but ask for it.
And then, again, if there is any blood taint in
your body ask for "30-Day Blood Cure" cir-
culars. They are free, too. That remark-
able cure expels all traces of the poison from
your system and makes you as clean as a
new-born babe. It is as certain to cure all
such cases as "Hudyan" is to restore
power:

The Disaster to the Maine
Shown to Be Solely
Due to Treachery.
Brave Men Who Escaped Death
on the Battle=Ship and Other
Witnesses Prove an Ex=

WASHINGTON, March 28.â The im
rr ;nse mass of testimony taken by tin?
J'aine Court of Inquiry was sent to the
â¢ c to-day, and with the President's
ige and findings of the court re
ferred to the Committee on Foreign Re
lations. The testimony Was taken on
eighteen different days, the fourteenth
day and over being devoted to viewing
the wreck. Every witness who was
known to have any information that
could throw light upon the great dis
aster was called to give his testimony.
The story of the destruction of the ves
sel is to-day not graphically given, but
In a manner which gives all the ob-
tamable facts. No technical detail is
omitted. Every movement and mci
dent connected wi%h the Maine from
the time she teft Key West until the
last diver examined the wreck slowly
sinking in the mud of Havana harbor
is Btated.
It is a story' intensely interesting to
the people. Those who read it could
have litt'r rioutit as to whether there
was an internal <>r external explosion.
Perhaps the most significant testimony

A nia.s.; of testimony is sub

board the ship by Captain Sigsbee and
his officers, and th<- apparent impos
sibility of accident occurring by an in
ternal cause, such as the heating of
bunkers, spontaneous combustion or
other causes upon which so many the
ories w â  re !>;'.s<-i].
The testimony of Captain Sigsbee Is
of the greatest importance and per
haps is of more general interest than
that of any other man called. "With ;
nd minuteness ne gives
an account of the management of the
ship, how she was handled, how she

what he knew about it and, in fact, 'â 
every point upon which the Govern-:

md In Importance of the testimo- !
â¢ Oaptaii Sigsbee Is that of Knsign
Powelson, who had charge of the divers
and knew from day to day what th" di
vers found. This officer was minutely
informed as to the construction of the
Maine and everything about her. If is
aony was to a certain extent tech
nical, bearing upon the construction of
ship, her plates, etc., but it was
from these plates and this technical
knowledge that he was able to declare
that the explosion took place from the
ie. The divers, Morgan. Olsen and
Smith, all contributed important evi
dence. They testified that the plates
were bent inward on the bottom port
side and outward on the starboard side.
Nothing in the testimony fixes re-
Bibility, but although conspiracy is 'â 
apparent, no knowledge ot the planting
of a mine is shown. Captain Sigsbee
states that a somewhat bitter feeling
existed against the American ship and I
Americans generally, and a witness j
whose name is suppressed tells of over- j
hearing a conversation among Spanish
Officers and a citizen indicating a fore
knowledge of the destruction of the
Maine by intention to blow her up. An
official of the American Consulate tells
tf information received anonymously
sending to show that a conspiracy ex
isted. But nothing was definitely stat
ed which fixes any responsibility upon
Spain or her Rubjects.

It was too late, however, the Maine having
already sailed. She arrived next day and re
: her .arrival at the State Department.
CAPTAIN Sir.SBKE in testifying before the
f'mirt of Inquiry said that he assumed r.im

remarks since the explosion, using Cap-
Ki ln Stevens, temporarily in command of the

thority for the statement, that he had never
in ail his experience, which covered
visits to Havana for five or six years, a man

in describing the surroundings when first
this buoy, Captain Sigsbee stated
that the Spanish man-of-war Alfonso XII was

MADRID. March 29.âAl
though the American Minister,
General Woodford, sturdily re
fuses to be interviewed, it has
come to my knowledge that he
saw this morning a prominent
gentleman in Madrid to whom
he stated that he was entirely
confident an early and effective
peace would soon be assured be
tween Spain and the United
States, a peace that would be
consistent with the honor of the
Spanish people and that would
secure justice to Cuba and ef
fective protection to the great
American interests in that is
land.
regulations and when Inflammables were in
excess of cheat capacity they were allowed to
. >pt in the Dathroom ol the Admiral's
cabin.
Regarding the electric plant of the Maine.
lin Sigsbee stated that there was no se
rious grounding nor sudden tlaring up Of the
lights before the explosion, but a sudden and
ti tal >â â  lipse. As for regulations aftv 'ting the
taking or the temperature of the magazines,
et . Captain Sigsbee stated there were no spe
clal regulations other than the usual reguia
tli ns required by the department. He exam-
Ined the temperature himself and conversed
with the ordnance officer as to the various
temperatures and the contents of the maga.
?.::..â .- and according to th>* opinion of this of
ficer, as well as Sigstx>e, the temperatures
w.-n- never at a dangerous point.
"I do not think there was any laxity in this
direction," said the captain, replying to a
tjuestion of Judge-Advocate Marix. He had
do recollection of any work going on In the
magazine or shellrooms on the day of the ex
plosion. The keys were called for in the usual
way on the day In question and were properly
returned. At the time of the disaster the two
after berths in the after flreroom were in use
because the hydraulic system was somewhat
leaking.
Shaking generally of the relations with the
Spanish authorities. Captain Sigsbee stated
that with the officials they were outwardly
cordial. The. members of th^ autonomistlc
council of the Government, however, .seem to
have !>routht to the attention of the Navy
Department the fact that he did not visit them,
at:.! that fact brought embarrassment tÂ« the
Government at Washington. He took the
ground to the department that it wa_s unknown
etiquette to call on the civil members of tike
colonial Government other than the Governors.
Without waiting for such an order. Captain
â  made B visit afterwards, and, as he
states, was pleasantly received, and his visit
was promptly returned by certain members of
the council. A party of ladies a.n<l gentlemen
called ni'.il the President of the council made
a speech which Captain Sigsbee could not un
derstand, but which was interpreted to him
briefly, to whom he replied.
"My reply," said Captain Sigsbee, "was
afterwards printed in at least two papers in
Havana, but the terms marie me favor auton
omlsttc Government in the island. I am In
formed that the autonomistie government In
Havana Is unpopular among a large class of
Spanish and Cul>an residents. I have no means
of knowing whether my apparent interference
In the political concerns of th<Â» island had any
relation to the destruction of the Maine.'
When asked whether there was any demon
stration of animosity by people afloat, Captain
Slgrabee said that there was never on shore
as he was Informed, but there was afloat. He
related that on the first Sunday after the
Maine's arrival a ferry boat, crowded densely
with people civil and military, returning from
a bull fight at . Reg-la, passed the Maine, and
about forty people on board indulged In yell
ins, whistling' and derisive calls. During the
stay in Havana Captain Sigsbee took more than
ordinary precautions for the protection of the
Maine by placing sentries on the forecastle and
poop, quarantine and signal boys on the bridge
and on the poop.
A corpr^al of the guard was especially in
structed to look out for the port gangway,
and the officer of the deck and quartermaster
were especially Instructed to look out. for the
starboard gangway; a quarter watch was kept
on deck all night; sentries' Cartridge boxes
were filled, their arms kept loaded, a number
of rapid-fire ammunition kept In the, pilot
room and In the spare captain's room and un
der the after . superstructure were kept addi
tional supplies of shells, close at hand for the
second battery; steam was kept up in two boil
ers instead of one and positive instructions
were given to watch carefully all the hy
draulic guns and report defects.
He said he had given orders to the master
at-arms and the order to keep a careful eye
i m everybody that came on board and to care
fully observe any packages that might bo held,
on the supposition that dynamite or other high
explosive might be employed, and afterward to
inspect the routes these people hail taken and
not to lose sight of the order. He states that
very few people visited the ship, IJcutenant-
Conunander Walnwrlght being rather severe
on visitors. There were only two or three of
the Spanish military officers who came on
board, but, according to the captain, they
were constrained and not desirous of accept
ing much courtesy. This visit was during the
absence of the captain. He said he made
every effort to have the Spanish officers visit
the ship to show good will, according to the
spirit of the Maine's visit to Havana, but
with the exceptions stated no military officers
of Spain visited the ship socially.
Captain Pigsbee then went Into details re
garding the precautions In force, and espe
cially In relation to quarter watches, which,
he said, had never been rescinded. One of
the cutters was in the water at the time of
the accident and' one of the steam launohes
was riding at the starboard boom. The cap
tain said that the night was quiet and warm,
.ml that he remembered hearing distinctly the
echoes of the bugle at tattoo, which was very
pleasant. Stars were out. the sky, however,
being overcast. The Maine at the time of
the explosion was heading approximately
northwest, pointing toward the shears. He
was writing at his i.ort cabin table at the
time of the explosion and was dressed.
He then went Into a description of the m
plosion when he felt the crash. He character
ized It :is a bursting, rending- and crashing
sound or roar of immense volume, largely me
tallic in Its character. It was succeeded by
a metallic sound, probably of falling debris.
a trembling and lurching motion of the ves
sel, then an Impression of subsidence, at
tended by an eclipse of electric lights and In
tense darkness within his cabin. He thought
Immediately that the Maine had I n blown
up and she was sinking. He hurried to the
starboard cabin, but changed his course to
the passage leading to the superstructure. Then
he detailed the manner of meeting: Private
Anthony, which is much the same as has been
published.
Lieutenant-Commander Wainwrig-ht was on
deck when Captain Sigsbeo emerged from the
passageway, and turning: to. the orderly he
asked for the time, which was given at 9:40
p. m. Sentries were ordered placed nhout the
ship and the forward magazine flooded. He
called for perfect silence. The surviving offi
cers were about him at the time on the poop,
f T > â¢ was informed that both forward nnd after
magazines were under water. Then came faint
cries and white floating bodies in thÂ» water.
Boats were at once ordered lowered, but only
two were found available, the gig and whfile
boat. They wer" lowered and manned by offi
cers and men, and by the captain's directions
they left the shin and helped to save the
wounded jointly with other boats that had ar
rived on the scene. Fire amidships by this
time was burning fiercely and the spare am
munition in the pit of the house was explod-
Ing-.
At this time lieutenant-Commander Waln
wright said he thought the 10-inch magazine
forward had been thrown up Into' the burning
mass and might explode. Everybody wan then
directed to ,get Into the boats over the stern,
which was done, the captain getting lntÂ« the
els and then proceeding to the City of Wash

ington, where he found the wounded in the
dining salon being carefully attended by the
officers and crew. He then went on deck and
observed the wreck for a few minutes and
gave directions to have a muster taken on
board the City of Washington and other ves
sels and sat down in the captain's cabin and
dictated a telegram to the Navy Department.
Various Spanish officials came on board and
expressed sympathy and sorrow for the acci
dent. The representatives of General. Blanco
and of the admiral of the station were among
the Spanish officials who tendered their sym
pathies. About four or five men were found
that night who survived.
By the time Captain Sigsbee reached the
quarter deck it was his impression that an
overwhelming explosion had occurred. When
he came from the cabin he was practically
blinded for a few seconds. His only thought
was for the vessel , and he took no note of the
phenomenon of the explosion. In reply to the
direct question of whether any of the maga
zines or shell rooms were blown up the Cap
tain said It was extremely difficult to come to
any conclusion. The center of the explosion
was beneath and a little forward of the con
ning tower on the port side. In the region of
the center or axis of the explosion was the
six-inch reserve magazine, which contained
very little powder, about 300 pounds. The ten-
Inch magazine was in the same general region,
but on the starboard side. Over the ten-inch
magazine In the loading room of the turret
and in the adjoining passage a number of ten-
Inch shells were loaded. According to Cap
tain Sigsbee it would be difficult to conceive
the explosion Involved the ten-Inch magazine
because of the location of the explosion and
that no reports show that any ten-Inch shells
were hurled Into the air because of the ex
plosion.- The captain went Into details as to
the location of the small ammunition. He said
that he did not beleive that the forward
magazine blew v- The location of the gun
cotton was aft. under the cabin. The gun
cotton primers and the detonators were always
kept in the cabin. ' Ho stated that he had ex
amined the wreck himself, conversed with
other officers and men, but as the Spanish
authorities were very much averse, to an In
vestigation except officially on the grounds,
as stated by th- Spanish Admiralty, that the
honor of Spain was involved, he forbore to
examine the submarine portion of the wreck
for the cause of the explosion until the day
the court convened. He Bald the discipline of
the ship was excellent. The marine guard
was in excellent condition. The report of the
medical department shows that about one man
and a quarter per day were on the sick list
during the past year. In the engineer's de
partment the vessel was always ready and al
ways responsive. lie paid a tribute to the
crew and said that a quieter, better natured
lot of men he had never known on board any
vessel in which he had served. He had no
fault to find with the behavior of any man
at the time of the disaster and considered their
conduct admirable.
â  On his ' examination by the court Captain
Sigsbee said that the highest temperature
that he could observe was 112, but hat was In
the after magazine, the temperature In the
forward magazines being considerably lower.
There was no loose powder kept in the mag
azine. All the coal bunkers were ventilated
through air tubes examined weekly by the
chief engineer, and were connected electri
cally to the annunciator near his cabin door.
The forward coal bunker on the port side was
full. Th" forward coal bunker on the star
hoard side was half full, and was being used
at the time of the explosion.
Captain Sigsbee being recalled stated' that he
had detailed Lieutenant-Commander Waln
wright. Lieutenant Hnlman and Chief Engi
neer Holman, all of the Maine, to obtain In
formation In relation to any outsiders who
might have seen the explosion. Captain Sigsbee
also gave as his opinion that If coal bunkers
A-16 had been so hot as to be dangerous to the
Fix-Inch reserve magazine, this condition
would have been shown on three sides where
the bunker was exposed, and that men con
stantly passing to and fro by It would have
necessarily noticed any undue heat.
Captain Sigsbee was recalled and examined
as to the ammunition on board the Maine. He
stated that there were no high explosive gun
cotton, detonators or other material in maga
zines or shell rooms which the regulations pro
hibited. He testified that no war heads had
been placed on torpedos nince he had ccKsanand
of the ship.
ENSIGN W. V. X. POWELLSON was called
the third of the court. He testified that he
had been present on the Maine every day from
the arrival of the boat Fern and during a
great deal of the diving.
In reply to a question to tell the court all
about the conditions of the wreck he said the
forward part of the ship forward of the after
smokestock had been to all appearances com
pletely destroyed. The conning tower lay in
a position opposite the door leading to the
superstructure aft and to starboard, Inclined
at about 110 degrees to the vertical, with the
top of the conning tower in board. Continu
ing, he described with close detail the condi
tion under the main deck on the port side.
The fixtures were completely wrecked, while
fixtures In thÂ«> same position on the star
board side were in some cases almost Intact.
The port bulkhead between the main and
borth deck at the conning tower support had
been blown aft on both sides, but a great deal
more on the pert than on the starboard side.
* The fire room batch. Immediately abaft of
the conning tower bad beep blown In three di
rections, aft, to starboard and to port. The
protective decks and the conning tower sup
ports were bent In two directions, the plates on
the -.<'â !.:",! side being bent up and on the
port side bent down.
In ii'i'ly to an inquiry whether he meant
with reference to their original positions. En
sign Powellson replied nfflmatlvely. The beams
supporting the protective deck, a few inches
abaft of the armored tube, to port of midship
line, was bent up to starboard of the midship
line. Just forward of the conning tower, un
derneath the main deck two beams met at
right angles: one beam was broken and push
ed from port to starboard. A grating was
found on the poop awning just forward of the
after searchlight.
The piece 01 side plating just abaft of the
starboard turret was visible. This plate was
bent outward and then the forward end bent
upward and folded backward upon ltseir. This
plate was severed from the rest of the plating
below the water- line. This plating below th â¢
water line had been pushed out to starboard.
The gratings of the engine room hatch were
blown off. A composition strainer was picked
up from the bottom, on the starboard quar
ter, at a point about opposite the poop capstan
and about thirty feet from It. The chief en
gineer thought the trainer was from the fire
men's washroom. There was not a strainer
In the ship's side. Near the piece of outide
plating which was referred to above, he said
there were pieces of red shellacked
planks. On these planks was bolted a com
position track two inches wide and an. inch
thick.
Ensign Powellson asked If the court meant for
him to say anything about what the divers
reported, or Just what he saw.
The Judge-advocate replied that he would like
to have him state any important discoveries
which might lead the court to draw some con
clusion as to the cause, and if a diver gave
such information, to state the diver's name.
Before doing so the Judge-ad.vocate asked
witness to state If the forward and after part
of the ship were in line. Ensign Powellson
replied that as far as he could Judge, they
were not. The end where the explosion oc
curred seemed to be pushed from port to star
board from five to ten degress. he should
Judge, with the apex to the starboard. â¢ The
divers reported to witness .that at a point where
the ten-Inch shell room should he they dis
covered the ten-inch shells regularly arranged,
but the ship Rank down so low that some of. the
shells were in the mud.
Gunner Morgan reported that In walking
on the bottom he fell into a hole on the port
side and went down In the mud. He also re
ported, as far as he could Judge, everything
seemed to be bent upward In the vicinity of
this hole. He also reported that the plates
seemed to have been pushed over to the star
board and then bent down.
Ensign Powellson then said that a powder
tank that he saw appeared to be an empty
tank, broken by the explosion, as .It was not
badly dented and merely ripped" the length of
the seam. The ten-Inch tank was badly bat
tered out of any conceivable shape.
Continuing, the witness said the divers, up
to the night before he was then on the stand,
hail not been on the outside of the ship. The
mud was too deep for them to walk on the
bottom. . â 'â *: ':â 
"What is the condition of the starboard tur
ret witness was asked.
"To my knowledge, it has not been found
sir," was the reply.
He understood something had been found
under the place where the turret formerly
was, but Its exact character had not been de
termined.
"About what impression Is produced lpon
your mind?" Ensign Powellson was askel.
"From the ship alone, or of the appearance
of the wreck?"
"Either from such reports or the condition
which you believe to exist."
"The Impression produced upon me," replied
the 'witness, "is that an explosion tjok pl.i"e
well to port of midship line and at a point
in the length ' about â¢ opposite the conning
tower."
Witness then replied to further questions
that bis opinion was based upon the observa
tion of things above water. He gave no weight
to Morgan's statement about falling into a
hole â  ii the port side, because Morgan might
have been mistaken all the time, Referring to
his notes made of things on the Maine, Knsifrn
Powellson said that the arch of the engine
room, telegraph and the shaft r.f the. steering
gesr coming down through the armored tube
(turret) was bent from port to starboard. Tht
port side of the protected dec-K was covered
with a greasy deposit, the stirboar-1 side be
in" comparatively free from !t.
The forward smoke pipe between the main
and superstructure decks did not show any
Sikhs Of the Internal pressure of gases. . On the
main deck forward of the conning: tower, where
the foie and aft. angle bulb was located, the
planking was blown off on the only remaining
plate of the main deck on thp port side, while
the wood was still attached to that part of the
starboard side between the conning tower
base and the turrets. What witness saw would
Indicate that the pressure lifted the protec
tive deck on the port side and the protec
tive deck on the starboard FidÂ« held fnst and
bont that deck downward. "Witness here ex
hibited two sketches to the court showing a
diagram of various parts of the .sunken ship
and explained them to the court.
The witness' â  evidence about the strip on the
starboard side of the outside t plating of the
ship, which was folded and rolled backward
was recalled to him. Powellson said he could
see the plate bent outward as if It was only
two â¢ feet under water where the breaK oc
curred. Witness had taken soundings and had
found five fathoms of , water on both sides of
the Mnine down to the mud. Taking a four
teen pound lead line, and dragging with a
wherry for obtructlons on the port â¢ side, â¢ drag

In answer to puestlons Powellson said there
FEARS OF RIOT AT HAVANA
NEW YORK, March 28.â A
Washington special to the Her
ald says: Havana's quiet is in
danger of being disturbed by an
other outbreak such as occurred
in the Cuban city just before the
late second-class battleship
Maine dropped anchpr in its har
bor.
Consul-General Lee cabled to
the State Department to-day
that the situation was critical.
There is danger of further riots
growing out of the intense anti-
American feeling among the
Weylerites.
In the light of General Lee's
dispatches the administration
authorities are now quite as
much concerned about the situa
tion in Havana as they are over
the fear that Congress will at
tempt to force the hand of the
President. It is now regarded as
one of the danger points of the
situation. The Navy Depart
ment is keenly on the alert. The
State Department transmitted
Consul-General Lee's message
to Secretary Long and he at once
informed Captain W. T. Samp
son, commander-in-chief of the
fleet at Key West, of the char
acter of its contents.
Captain Sampson is in direct
communication with Consul-
General Lee and at the slightest
sign of trouble a message from
the Consul-General to the naval
officer will result in the arrival
of a man-of-war in Havana har
bor within four hours.
was rothlng left of the port plating at all. He
dragged along the outside to see If anything had
fallen out, ani found nothing. Witness thought
the ship on the port side was entirely gone
opposite a point indicated in a diagram hand
ed to the court It was entirely blown up.
This concluded Ensign Powellson's testimony
on the third day. Knslgn fowellson was re
called on the sixth day, when he said since his
last testimony he had read a book of specifi
cations from the Maine. Refreshing his mem
ory from these records he said the plate on the
protective deck were only one inch thick,
weighing forty pounds per square foot.
Knslsn PowelUon, wishing to give some tes
timony rejtaidink the condition of the wreck.
Gunner's Mate Olsen, the diver, was admitted
In ord-jr that he might correct any erroneous
statement, the two having worked together.
Povver.-on said that on February 23 Diver Wil
sjn reported to him that on coning up from
b^low he had followed the forward ana aft
winjr* of Uk V-sha:>e, made by .he bottom
plating at frame 15. and said the forward
win? of th? V the plates ran down on a very
steep clan' and then turned under and out
under the starboard side; that just above where
the plates turned to go under the starboard
side he fi.und two dents as if the plating had
teen bulged lr between the frames from out
side in. The court asked the size of these two
dents.
Powellson replied that they were about two
and a half feet long and bulged in about six
inches. He further testified that Olsen again
went down and again came to the surface at
11 o'clock, saying he thought he had found the
flat keel. Olset. had reported that > the keel
was eloping downward about 45 degrees and to
port, with the after part of the keel upper
most. He said h< had explored the after wing
of the V and had found a semicircular hole
about two feet below the rivet holes all around
IC He f-aid tret a semicircular hole was about
twenty feet in m the top from the V made by
the bottom lifting. He said the plate pre
sented a jagged appearance, as if It had been
torn, and that a crack had extended from
the bottom edge o.' the semicircular hole In
a distance of about eight Inches, and that the
rlates about the hole were bent away from
the green fide of the plating, Powellson con
tinued, Oioen tdd him he had found a hole
cut vi a flute twenty-five feet from the H.xtk'9
ill the V, and exhibited a sketch showing that
the Iced line wna found by him sloping down
about Gm ut'Kree* below the horizontal and to
port. .. i <
Th* point TÂ«)>ere he had found the keel was
alout twenty fie* under water. He had not
followed the k*ej at that point, as the plating
between was wee'eed and . .'.ened out so thÂ«.t
>v bad nothing 'â â¢ suÂ»6ort him. .~ "â  : '" " 'J
s Powellson said Olsen testified that about
twenty feet from the sluice valve he found an
opening in the ship's side. He had found
boarding near the sea suction in apartment
AiO. about 21 feet from the .sluice valve, in an
almost vertical position, although it was orig
inally horizontal.
"If you consider the section of the shin be
tween frame 18 and 33." continued Powellson,
"and consider that part of the bottom Homing
between irame 18 and frame 13 is bent out a
right angle, and then that the whole section
is turned forward M degree?, you will â¢â¢ieture
the position in which the plates a,"" now
found. This plating could either have been
shoved out from the after side or it could have
been pushed in from the forward side. The
only indication as to how this was dpne is the
wooden boarding. If the after part of the
plating had been pushed out trom the inside
the boarding would have been broken at the
angle which the plate* make. If the forward
part of the plating had been pushed in. the
boards would have bt-^n pulled away from the
after plating as Is the case with the plates
now."
The Judge Advocate asked .wells.in how he
looked upon Olsen's testimony In view of his
knowledge of the Maine and the- drawings of
the vessel. He replied that he regarded it as
extremely accurate.
The Judge Advocate asked Powelison what
he deduced from all this testimony received
from the diver that forenoon, together with
what information as he had had before Pow
ellson replied that he thought the explosion
occurred on the port side where about
frame 18, center of Impact. The ship yielded
at 17 and also at 15, but it was pretty' hard
to say exactly where the impact came. Frame
15 was blown in.
"How do you account for the Immense dam
age done abreast ' the reserve magazine
where there is nothing left, whereas between
frames 16 and 18 you have found damaged
plates?" Powellson was asked.
â My idea." he replied, "la that after the
ship was raised up at frame Is. the magazines
one or all of them, after that were exploded'
for some powder tanks that I have seen I
â¢think were exploded, while others I have seen
were not exploded. I saw a r.>ff e e can tnat
was brought up this morning which was as
badly battered as most of the powder cases
that came ui>. It looked in very much the
same condition."
"When you say some of the powder tanks
in your opinion, exploded, ami some had not!
do you refer to 6-lnch tanks only, or 2-Inch
tanks also?"
"I refer to both, as I have sÂ«>en a 6-inch tank
that was very little ripped open, and I saw
one this morning that had been first opened
and flattened out, with evidences of burnt
powder in It. 1 saw one 10-inoli tank that was
scarcely battered at all, and only the head of
it gone. I also saw 10-inch tanks with the
packing which looked like |w>wder unburnt, so
that in my opinion some, but not all, of the
10-inch and 6-inch charges were exploded."
Powellson said four or five tanks had be*i
brought 'up that morning, but he did not see
all of them. The only one he remembered
seeing was exploded and burned out so that
the case formed almost a plain surface. The
10-inch tank had its head removed, but it had
preserved its approximate shitpe.
When questioned further as to what he re
garded as the cause of the Injuries, Powellson
said: "On the bottom, where the frame was
thrown up. it would seem to me that force
was communicated some distance through the
water, "because it was llfed up instead of be
ing battered in.' It was a force that was
cushioned in some way, because the diver tells
me there was a bulge in the plates between the
two frames, and such a force as that would be
a cushion pressure. So the plates In thnt
part of the ship having been broken in the
explosion may have occurred aft. and the
frames forward of the transverse armor being
weaker than they are aft. the ship might have
been lifted up there by this cushion pressure
from further, aft.
"It struck me." continued Powellson. speak
ing of the same part of the vessel, "that the
mine there could not have been very close to
those plates that were lifted up. because, as
I say, the plates are not fo much damaged or
bent in the form of a V and raised ui> a ver
tical distance. It srems to me that the mine
was somewhat removed and the pressure came
through the waters which produced that cush
ion-sort of pressure."
Ensign Powellson was recalled on February
2Ti and showed the plans of the Maine frnrii
which he had identified the bottom plates that
were blown up through the upper deck. The
finding of these plates on top of the wreck,
clear above water, was among the first and
most Important point* Â°' evidence clearly dis
proving the possibility of an internal explo
sion. After minutely describing the bottom
plates, with their green ceiling of paint and
other marks by which they wore identified.
I'owellson stated that they must have been
blown up 38 or 39 feet to reach their present
position.
Heside.s the bottom plates. Powellson found
some peeves from the bottom compartment
lodged in the angle of the bottom plates that
protruded above the water. The berth deck
over this bottom compartment was also on top
of the wreck and 20 feet forwnrd of tlv i| a tes
while this section of the main deck has dis
appeared. The diver who had beea working
for Powellfion on this investigation informed
him that he had found the ammunition for the
six-inch macazine pushed over to the star
board side.
Ensign Powelson was recalled on the eleventh
day and described the reports made to him
by' the divers, which were afterward directly
testified to before the bonrd.
"March 5." testified Powellson, "I sent Olsen
down the piece of keel, the vertical keel, to
make further explorations of the ten
inch magazine. He went down to where the
keel became horizontal at frame 23, walked aft
about twenty-five feet and climbed over a lot
of wreckage consisting of plates and bulkheads
Mandir-K upright. These upper ends were rag
ged and he crawled over them to what li 3
thought was a part of a boiler. He could not
| Rive definite details, but he thought It was a
j boiler. A little after this he walked out to
port clear of the ship in the mud. He was
at this time forward of the break of the sh:\.
at frame 41. Returning about ten feet, he found
wreckage. He examined tins plate and {pund
it curved, as if It was a part of the ship. It
pointed toward the starboard bow, but it was
so dark .he could not distinguish the color. All
the edspg of the plating were rough. The <*om
: partment seemed to be three and a half or
i four feet wide. Forward from this point he
found a Fix-inch tank. It was intact It
proved to bo a full tank. He found a lot of
broken tanks split on the seams. In one tank
at the cover, which has holes in it. he found
a lot of mud, which was brouslit up and
which looked like dissolved powder. There
was' any quantity of similar mud in the same
place. The mud around the tanks was black,
thfit of the harbor gray.
Powellson was recalled on March 15, and ex
; plained how he got the data for his sketches,
; which played such an important part In the
I work of the court. He said he sent divers
! down at various points along the line of the
keel as !t lay broken and twisted on the harbor
! bed. Then he got in a boat and located the
points on the keel by a lead line. In the wreck
; he established stations at the mainmast, the
I port crane, the smokestack and so forth, and
i from these bases he would get the bearings
I by angles of his lead line as It rested on the
! Ueel and othi-r points of the wreckage under
water. Thus he was able to plat a ma,) of the
; wreck both above and below water that was
mathematically correct. By comparing th.s
with the original plans of the ves=el it was
| possible to tell just how much and In what
i direction any part of the Maine had been dis
: torteil by the explosion without relying on un
; der water' estimates by the divers.
PRIVATE WILLIAM ANTHONY of the
United States Marine Corps, whose coolness at
the time of the explosion in reporting to Cap
tain Sigsbee has become the theme of admira
tion throughout the world, was the next wit
ness.
He testified that he had the first watch from
8 to 12 o'clock on the night of the explosion.
There was drill that day, and it was not
necessary to open the magazines. In response
to questions. Private Anthony told his story:
"I was standing on the main deck just out
' side the door on the larboard side. I first
noticed a trembling and buckling of the decks
and this prolonged roarâ not a short report,
but a prolonged roar. The awningrs were
' spread and where the wing awning and the
i quarterdeck awning Should Join there was a
| space of at least eighteen inches. I looked
I out and saw an Immense sheet of flames, and
j then I started toward the captain."
"Did you notice any perceptible list to the
ship at the first shock?"
"At the first shock the ship Instantlyâ that
in, the quarterdeck, where I was standingâ
: dipped forward and to port Just like that (In
dicating it). It apparently broke in the middle
i like that (Indicating) and surged forward and
i then over to port."
Witness said the upshoot of the flames he
saw was well forward. "It must have been
i forward of the superstructure. I could see the
debris going up with it. I do not know what
it was, but I saw firebrands going up."
"Was it on the port or starboard side?"
"It looked more to port than it did to star
1 board. It looked like it covered the whole
I ship. It was an Immense glare that illumined
i the whole heavens for the moment, as much
as I could see for the awnings."
"Did you see any water with it?"
"I did not notice that, sir. I started for the
cabin at once.'
1 This closed the brave marine's testimony.
CHAPLAIN JOHN CHIDWICK was In his
i room on board the night of the occurrence.
He said: "I heard a loud report and every
thing became dark. The electric light? wert
out. and there was a crashing sound of things
falling. I rushed on deck and got to the cir
tain's poop, where I saw thp captain giving
his orders. After trying to cheer up the men
who wore crying out in the water for help I
w.is ordered by Lieutenant Jungen to go into a
boat, which I did. He rowed around ihe ship
and picked up one man. Then at the cap
tain's instance we pulled for the ship City of
Washington."
Asked how many shocks he felt, witness said
j he remembered only one.
; PIGMUNP M. ROTHSCHILD, one of the
passengers on the City of Washington, was an
pyf> witness to the explosion. In company with
his friend, Louis Wertheimer. who was aboard
â¢ the City of Washington on- the night of Feb
ruary 15. as she sailed into Havana harbor,
i he wÂ«s on the stern of the Washington,
which lay astern and on th^ port side of th<Â»
Maine. The vessels were about a huniirM
yards apart. Rothschild said he was naturally
Interested In the Main*- and had taken a po
sition where he ODUiu get a good look at her.
Just as he had takf-n his eyes off her to move
, his chair, there was a sound like a cannon
shot In the darkness. Hi' Immediately looked
; toward the Maine. He saw the forward end
of the vessel rise, he thought, a couple of feet
! out of the water. An instant later came a sec
; ond distinct explosion. '
' This seemed to burst from the interior of the
vessel forward in a dull .flame, and the nir
i was instantly filled with flvlng debris. The
vessel lurched back In the water after the force
i of the first detonation that had lifted her bow
and quickly bep-an to sink forward. In l^ss
I than a minute her bow had disappeared. The
wreck took fire and burned for two hours.
. There were single reports that kept up
throurrh all that time, and the fixed ammuni
tion was reached by the flames, but these were
I not to b" confused with the two big explosions
\ that had destroyed the Maine.
There â  was no doubt about the separation of
; the first two explosions, an Interval of two
; seconds at least separating them. The much
I discussed section of cement that fell on the
â  deck of the Washington was two Inches thick
and weighed thlrtv pounds. The engineer of
! the Washington showed it to me. Pieces of
I iron stove In some of the Washington's boats
: and delayed the work of rescue. Other wreck
1 age was hurled clear over the Washington.
The boats of the Spanish warship Alfonso
\ XII. he said, were prompt to go to the rescue,
j and were aided by the searchlights.
CHIEF GUNNER'S- MATE OLSEN of the
I United States steamship lowa told how he had
j been sent to Havana for the purpose of doing
i diving duty on the wreck. He had de
j scended four time*, making about eight or
! nine hours .of total examination. Olseri told
how on his first descent he went over the* for
ward part of the ship. To use his own ex
j pression, he said: "I found the wreck all
i blowed up. I found a lot of grate bars down
! there."
Asked If he imagined himself looking for
! ward, he stated that he did. Going over the
' plates he struck Into a lot of . 6-inch shells
i with the slings on them. Going to the right,
I witness stated he found a lot of wreckage. It
seemed to have been blown over the starboaru.
Olsen stated that he put his hands into the
cracks and brought out several 6-pounder
shells.
The next time he went down Olsen testified
he went outside the ship, forward of the crane
on the port side. He followed the bottom along
and found that the ship's side waa blown out
i board, and alongside the crane it could be
j walked on.
"At the part where she was blown up com-
I pletely,' witness said, "part of her bottom
plates are turned up. Then you follow the bot
tom from there up and the plates are blown
! outboard. At the top and underneath the bot
j tom they are blown Inboard and bent in. About
1 three feet forward of that spot there was a
I piece of iron lying along the bulkhead. The
skin of the inside of the double bottoms is
' curled like a sheet of paper Inboard from stem
I to stern. Amidships on the same place there
! is an armor plate, one plate complete, the -top
of the plate standing up. The plate is in
' clined over the starboard completely. It stands
up with the thick part of the plate down. It
is Inclined forward and over the starboard.
â  LOUIS WERTHEIMER, a tobacco dealer of
New York, who was a passenger on the
steamer City of Washington. In Havana har
bor the night of the blowing up of the Maine,
the moment of the explosion was in the stern
of the Washington and was looking directly at
the battleship when the explosion occurred.
"I beard a report," said Werthelmer, "and
at an Interval of anywhere from five to fifteen
seconds following the first report came a great
explosion. In the hurst of flame which fol
lowed I clearly and plainly saw the vessel
rise In the water, apparently about three yards
out then settle down before the light of the
â  explosion went out. The whole thing was over
' so quickly that I cannot hazard a guess as to
the length of the time."
CAPTAIN FRANK STEVENS, of the City
of Washington, testified that he â  was stand-
Ing amidships of his ship where he could look
I toward the Maine when she was blown up.
He heard a dull, muffled explosion and com
motion as though it was under the water, fol
lowed instantly by a terrific explosion, light
ing up the sky with a dull red blaze and fill
ing the air with missiles which fell around
him He felt a trembling- of the ship at the
last of the explosions on the Maine. There was
a decided Interval between the first and second
noise of the explosions. He was not stand
ing where he could see the Maine lift.
LIEUTENANT - COMMANDER RICHARD
W VINWRIGHT testified that the regulations
In regard to the paints and inflammables and
other precautions were strictly carried out on
hoard ship. Every possible care was taken
to avoid incident. All visitors were r.ci>itmi,:-;<!

There was fine discipline, obedient crew,

CONGRESS
HEARS MR.
McKINLEY
Message of the President
Presented to Senate
and House.
Among the Representatives and
People Assembled There
Was Most Significant
Silence.
NEW YORK, March 28.â A Washington special to the Telegram
says: Senator Morgan has prepared a declaration of war which he pro
poses to introduce at the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Relations
next week. When the Senator was invited to the White House last week
he informed the President that he would not hesitate to declare war
against Spain without regard to the Maine incident. Now Senator Mor
gan intends to make good his suggestion by offering a resolution declar
ing war against Spain, in committee Wednesday, and let the cpmmittee
consider the subject. He says he believes the majority of the commit
tee will favor such a proposition.
Senator Frye of Maine, who is one of the most vigorous members
of the committee, says he is in favor of calling the committee to
gether at once, and holding it in session until it submits a report to the
Senate in favor of Cuban independence.
WASHINGTON, March 28.â A scene
of intense interest was presented in the
Senate to-day when the President's
message transmitting the findings of
the Maine Court of Inquiry was re
ceived. The galleries were packed to
the doors and the attendance of Sena
tors was quite as large as it has been
at any time during the present session.
Eager to ascertain the full findings of
the court, scores of members o-f the
House after the adjournment of that
body, had hurried to the Senate cham
ber and the floor was crowded with
them.
When the reading of the President's
message was begun, silence was so
marked all over the chamber that one
might have heard a pin fall. Through
out the reading of the message and the
findings of the court there was not the
slightest demonstration.
At 12:01 Executive Clerk Pruden car
ried to the Senate the President's mes
sage transmitting the long and much
desired report of tM Court of Inquiry.
As Major Pruden was recognized by
the Vice- President there was a hush in
the chamber, a majority i-f the spec
tators expecting that the message and
report would be read to the Senate im
mediately.
Routine business, however, was taken
up for a time.
At 12:17 Morgan of Alabama demand
ed the reading of the President's mes-
sage.
Instantly there was a hush in the
chamber. V ice-President Hobart at
once laid the message before the Sen>
ate, and its reading was begun The
closest attention was given by every
person within hearing.
At the conclusion of the reading of
the message Davis of Minnesota, chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Re
lations, amid a buzz of whispered con
versation, rose and requested that
the findings of the Court of Inquiry be
read.
At the conclusion of the reading Da
vis moved that the message of the
President, the findings of the Court of
Inquiry and the testimony taken before
the court be referred to the Commit
tee on Foreign Relations and ordered
printed. It was so ordered.
Lodge of Massachusetts introduced a
resolution that 2000 additional copies
of the message, findings and testimony
be printed for Use of the Senate. The
resolution was agreed to.
Senator Money then spoke of the Cu
ban situation. He said that the task
he had set himself was perhaps one
of supererogation, as Senators Procter,
Gallinger and Thurston had already
presented to the Senate the conditions
in Cuba as they had seen them. Their
statement*? were concise, brilliant and
eloquent, and while he did not hope
to add much to the information they
had furnished, he felt it his duty to
speak, and to speak now.
Money said he was willing to go to
any extent to feed the starving, clothe
the naked and relieve the sick upon
that unhappy island, but he was satis
fied no definite results could be ob
tained by the employment of such
means alone. He said he was certain
that while Weyler was a willing in
strument he was in fact only an in
strument in the hands of a higher
power â a power that had deliberately
determined upon a plan of starvation
and extermination. The frightful and
inhuman scheme had originated in the
brain of Canovas, the all-powerful
Prime Minister of Spain, who preceded
Sagasta.
"That plan of reconcentration and
starvation and death declared Money,
"was deliberately planned, with the
definite and distinct purpose in view of

NEW YORK, March 28.â A
Washington special to the Her
ald says: Senator Foraker of
Ohio has determined not to wait
for executive action in regard to
the Cuban question any longer.
Unless he can be persuaded by
other Senators not to do so, he
will to-morrow introduce in the
Senate a jt?int resolution recog
nizing the independence of Cuba.
He has been very impatient for
many months and has only re
frained from trying to secure
infmediate Congressional action
looking to the termination of
war in Cuba by the conviction
that it would be impossible to
get anything of the kind through
the House, which had refused to
consider Senator Morgan's bel
ligerency resolution.

Bead in the House.
WASHINGTON. March 28. â The
reading of the President's message in
the House to-day was listened to with
breathless interest by the members and
the spectators in the galleries, which
were crowded In like sardines in a box.
On the floor there was almost as
much excitement as in the galleries, al
though the full synopsis of the report,
which was printed Tby the Associated
Press, had taken the keen edge off the
anxiety with which the members
awaited the reading of the official find
ing of the board. Upon the desk of the
late Representative Simpkins of Massa
chusetts, who died suddenly on Satur
day night, a wreath of Easter lilies, in
terwo-ven with tulip, crocus and lilies
of the valley, cast an air of sadness
over the vast assemblage.
At exactly 12 o'clock the Speaker
called the House to order. Amid the
impressive silence that followed the
blind chaplain delivered a solemn pray
er which rang through the hall like a
warning. He referred to the storm
clouds that hung above the country,
threatening to break at any time. He
prayed to God to interpose his power;
that these clouds might pass away*
leaving us in peace and tranqufllity.
"And yet, if war must come," he
prayed, "in vindication of truth and
justice, mercy and right, help us to be
prepared with brain and heart and
brawn to meet it. To this end be with,
the President and his Cabinet and all
officially connected with the affairs of
state."
Speaker Reed himself broke the large
red sal of the envelope and handed it
to the clerk, at the same time announc
ing in a clear, distinct voice:
"A message from the President of the
United States."
No Presidential message was ever
listened to with such breathless Inter
est. Members sat with intense faces
straining to catch every- word.
The Speaker immediately announced
the reference of the message to the
Committee on Foreign Relations, under
the rules.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 28.â 1n the House of
Commons to-day A. J. Balfour, Acting
Minister for. Foreign Affairs, replying
to Sir William Vernon Harcourt, the j
Liberal leuder, promised a Ministerial ;
statement on the situation in the Far
East before Easter.
The Globe (Conservative) says this
afternoon: The disappointment of the
Government supporters at the progress
of affairs in the Far East is becoming
more acute. Unless it is found that the
Government has secured some tangible
advantage, riot will set in among its
supporters. It is rumored, however,
from the best quarters that the appar
ent diplomatic defeat of Great Britain
masks a move of greatest importance,
which will give Great Britain a favor
able position.
A statement has been obtained In a
competent quarter respecting British
intentions in China in regard to the na
val movements in the East. It is ad
mitted that the British policy of main
taining the integrity of China, and com
jnerciaj status of all nations has been
abandoned, owing to the concessions ]
made to Russia and Germany. It is ]
added* The only course left Great Brit- |
am is to follow suit, obtain advantages
with the other powers and secure ade- j
quate compensation in her own inter- \
ests. This explains the British naval :
activity at Hongkong and elsewhere. ;
Therefore a movement upon the part of
Great Britain may be anticipated in the :
near future. It is deemed improbable !
that Japan, single-handed, or still less
in conjunction with China, will combat
thr- policy of the European powers. She j
will probably rest content with a com- I
promise satisfactory to her pride and
securing the position due her as the
fruit of her victories over China.
There la reason to believe, according
to a special dispatch from Shanghai,
that the American squadron at Hong
kong, instead of waiting', as was at first
supposed, in proximity to Manila, prep
aratory to a Hiepano-American war, is
really intended as a practical display of
American sympathy with Great Brit
ain's Chinese policy. The American
and British admirals, the dispatchadds,
have had frequent interviews.
Prince Henry of Prussia will leave
Hongkong forthwith in consequence of
the accentuation of the crisis.

LONDON. March 28.â The Herald's
European edition publishes the follow
ing poem from the pen of Alfred Aus
tin, the British poet laureate:
What is the voice I hear
On the wind of the Western sea?
Sentinel, listen from out Cape Cl"6ar,
And say what the voice may be.
'Tis a proud, free people calling loud to a
people proud and free.
And It cays to them: Kinsmen, hall!
Wo severed have been too long;'
Now let us have done with a worn-out
talc.
The tale of an ancient wrong.
And our friendship last long as love doth
last and be stronger than death is
strong.
Answer them, sons of the self-same race,
And blood of the self-same clan.
Let us speak with each other, face to
face,
And answer as man to man,
And loyally love and trust each other as
none but free men can.
Now fling them out to the breeze,
Shamrock, thistle and rose.
And the Star-spangled Banner unfurl
with these.
A message to friends and foes,
WhoreviT the sails of peace are seen and
wherever the war wind blows.
A message to bond and thrall to wake,
For wherever, we come, we twain.
The throne of the tyrant shall rock and
quake.
And his menace be void and vain.
For you are lords of a strong young land
and we are lords of the main.
Yes. this Is tho voice on the bluff March
Rale:
We severed have been too long;
But now we have done with a worn-out
talo.
The tale of an ancient wrong.
And our friendship last lons as love doth
laÂ«t and be stronger than death Is
strong.

Court.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA. March 28.-At 10 o'clock this
morning, the hour fixed for pass |
â¢tence upon George W. Clark for the i
murder of his brother, the south court
room was crowded with spectators, and
Judge Ham for the first time In this
county pronounced the judgment of .
death on a human being. In the per- ,
formance of this solemn duty the Judge
said to the prisoner:
"Stand up, Mr. Clark."
The command was obeyed and the
convicted man was told that he had
been informed against by the District
Attorney on a charge of murder-had
been brought to trial and found gu ty
of murder in the first degree, and that
it now became the duty of the court to
pass judgment. j
â¢â¢Have you any reason to state why j
judgment should not be passed upon
"SZS3& wL J dÂ£Â£ted to sit down
by his counsel and Attorney Webber
made a motion for a new trial on the
-round* first, that the court erred in
Us "decisions 'relating to the drawing
of the jury; second, that the court
erred in its nstructions to the jury;
third that the verdict was contrary to
[aw on circumstantial evidence, and
fourth that the verdict was contrary
tS the evidence in the case. The mo
tion was overruled and the defense took
M jsÂ£ Pt H2n again ordered Clark to
stand up. With a troubled look the
prisoner arose to his feet.
â¢Is there any further cause why
judgment should not be pronounced in
accordance with the verdict of the jury
in this case?" asked the Judge.
Clark made no reply, and Judge Ham
Pr^lt e now becomes the duty of the court
to award against you the judgment
which the law affixes to the crime of
which you have been convicted. In the
brief and simple language of our Penal
Code it is enacted. 'That every per
son guilty of murder in the first degree
shall suffer death or confinement in the
State Prison for life, at the discretion
of the jury trying the same.' In. your
case the jury failed to exercise any dis
cretion by returning a verdict, 'Guilty
of murder in the first degree'; hence,
there can be no other judgment pro
nounced by the court than that of
death.
"The contemplation of the enormity
of your guilt, although it cannot save
you from the penalty of your crime,
may nevertheless serve as a means to
arouse your conscience and enable you
to seek repentance and forgiveness
from a God of mercy, who. I believe, is
now your only refuge and hope."
Clark was then sentenced to be
hanged at San Quentin on June 3
After being taken to his cell the con
demned man cried like a child. He said
to the Sheriff that he would like to see
Mrs. Clark and her children.

Washington, March 28.
The sundry civil appropriation bill, as
agreed upon by the Senate Committee
on Appropriations, has been completed
and will probably be reported to the
Senate to-morrow. The appropriation
of $400,000 for commencing the con
struction of the San Pedro commerce
and refuge deep-water harbor is re
tained. This is a defeat for the Southern

War is authorized to- enter into an l
agreement that the contractor shall
look solely to the State of California :
for one-half of such expenditure to be ;
paid out of said State appropriation,
and the United States shall in no man
ner oe liable for said one-half.

REA AND HIS
MEN AT SEA
In Its Desperation the
"Gang" Makes Itself
Ridiculous.
Mistake of the Boss In Ap
pointing a "Campaign
Committee."
Names Members Without Consulting
Them and Many ReluaÂ©
to Sorvo.
Special Discatch to The Call.
SAN JOÂ£.i:, March 2S.â Every day
sees added strength given to the cause
of Â°-ood and economical government as
represented In the candidacy of tho
New Charter Club ticket, and added
desperation given to the efforts of the
"gang" and its members in behalf of
the people's municipal ticket.
The latest indulgence of the "gang'
in "ways that are dark" is the an
nouncement in the "gang" organ to
day of what is termed a "general cam
paign committee." In the list of names
published are those of a few who are
known to be notoriously under the con
trol of the boss, but also many who
have hitherto not shown any traces of
his collar. No facts are given to show
by whom, when or where this commit
tee was selected or appointed. A can
vass among a number of the men men
tioned as comprising the committee
elicited the information that they had
never even been consulted in the mat
ter'and had absolutely no knowledge of
their selection other than the publica
tion in the Mercury this morning.
Quite a number of them stated that
they would certainly decline to serve or
support the "gang" ticket, dubbed the
People's Municipal Ticket, or any of
the candidates thereon.
There was also published in the
"gang" organ what is alleged to be the
platform of the "gang" ticket. The
tirst plank in this reads as follows:
"Having given our undivided support
to the adoption of the new Charter
from its inception, we now pledge our
selves, if elected, to faithfully carry out
its provisions in spirit and letter."
There is also a significant failure to
inform the public where this platform
was created and who created it. It is a
fact, however, that many, if not most,
of the candidates on the so-called Peo
ple's municipal ticket were most stren
uous in their opposition to the adoption
of the new Charter.
Not the least important circumstance
connected with, the present campaign
are the worse than star-^.namber pro
ceedings that have characterized the
placing of the "gang" ticket before the
people. The only definite fact known is
that secret meetings have been held in
the office of C. D. Wright and a pro
gramme adopted that has been pre
scribed by "Jim" Rea. These facts have
not been given publicity, for reasons
that can easily be appreciated, through
the columns of the Mercury. But that
Rea and Johnnie MacKenzie compiled
the People's municipal ticket and gave
it to the public as a list of candidates
selected at an alleged meeting of busi
ness men is too generally known to be
discussed. Not one of the candidates
named in that ticket even attempts to
deny that his candidacy is supported by
Rea, MacKenzie and the men who fol
low the dictates of these bosses.
While the boss is calling into play
all kinds of devious political tricks to
delude and gain support for the candi
dates whom he now controls, and whom
he will more thoroughly control if they
are elected, the New Charter Club is
putting forth strenuous, open and manly
efforts In behalf of its ticket. In ac
cordance with the frank and coura
geous methods thcTt have marked its
course heretofore it Is holding a series
of tent meetings at which the public, is
welcomed and at which the club's can
didates, its plan of campaign and its
objects are fully and freely discussed.
One of these meetings was held' at the
corner of Fifth and Empire streets to
night. The tent was filled to overflow,
ing. AddrossÂ»s were delivered by J.
W. Allen. W. E, Crossman, M. O'Brien,
Adam Riehl. W. G. Alexander, Dr. H.
J. B. Wright, Colonel Hardy and C. L.
Wit ten.
In anticipation of a promised sensa
tional statement by Councilman George
B. Dittus, the Council chamber was fill
ed to-night to the standing-room point.
At the last session of the Council, in
the course of charges and counter
charges between Councilmen Dittus
and Nolting of responsibility for ex
travagant expenditureSj Dittus threat
ened to make a statement to-night;
taken from the official records, that
would show where the responsibility
rested for the nresent depleted condi
tion of the city treasury.
Nolting defied Dittus to make such a
statement and significantly remarked
that, if it were forthcoming he would
have something to say on the same
subject.
Dittus and Noitlnsr. since the last ses
sion, evidently thought it better to sot
tie their differences in private, for no
statement was forthcoming- to-night,
much to the disappointment and dis
gust of the large number of citizens
present.
When Dittus was asked why 'he had
not made srond his threat he said that
he preferred to wait until after the elec
tion. Dittus Is in the field as an inde
pendent candidate for Councilman
from the ward which he now repre
sents.

Differentials.
Decision Will Not Be Reached

To- Day.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 28.â The Transcon
tinental Freight Bureau, which was in
session at Monterey last week, opened
its sessions at the Hotel Vendome to
day. Chairman Countiss presided. In
the afternoon a large amount of. un
important routine business was con
sidered, but no definite action was
taken upon any vital question.
The chief topic before the bureau is
still the matter of the difference in
rates on fractional or whole carload
lots. There is much variance of inter
ests among the lines represented upon
this point, and the decision will be
reached with difficulty. In this matter,
as in all others, the various roads rep
resented will be bound by the decision
of the bureau.
There was some further discussion on
the subject of west-bound rates and
east-bound were also considered. It is
expected that west-bound tariff rates
will re readjusted at the session to
morrow.

METHODS OF
REA'S ORGAN
San Jose Mercury's Vain
Attempt to Besmirch
The Call.
Rails at a Dispatch Sent by the
Associated Press, of Which
Its City Editor Is
Agent.
SAN JOSE, March 28.â Some indig
nation and some amusement has been
caused here by an attack the Mercury
contained this morning, directed at The
CalL It begins in this fashion:
.-LANDERED BY THE CALL.
A jng the dastardly attempts to Injure
8a:. ta Clara Valley and San Jose that
have been perpetrated by the San Fran
cisco Call during the past few months,
not one is calculated to do more real In
lury than the following, which appeared
â in that paper yesterday;
Next there Is a copy of the dispatch,
â which, for the purpose of making clear
the ground of the Mercury's screed, Is
here produced:
"A cold wave struck Santa Clara Coun
ty last night, and after the soaking rain
r>{ yesterday morning a heavy frost re
sulted. Great damage was done to
cereals. The entire almond, peach, apricot
and prune crop of the valley was de
stroyed, as well as the grain. Vegetables
suffered to a great degree. The fanners
pay it is the worst frost that ever struck
this section at this time of the year, and
the damage is greater than ever before
known."
And having set up this man of straw
the Mercury proceeds to flail the chaff
from it, finding in the operation much
apparent Joy. As a matter of fact, the
people of San Jose understand the ani
mus of the outbreak. They have wit
nessed with satisfaction the exposure
The Call has meted out to "Jim" Rea,
as unconscionable a boss as assists in
degrading the politics of the State.
They knew he would seek some way in
which to try to get even and recognize
the fact that through his daily organ
he has sought it and failed.
The item to which the Mercury
takes such violent exception, and for
which it blames the San Francisco
publication, was sent out by the As
sociated Press, of which the repre
sentative in San Jose is city editor
of the Mercury. The item was used
in the Chronicle and Examiner as
well as in The Call, and in no in
stance did anybody here ascribe the
circumstance to malice until the edi
torial genius, inspired by Rea, reared
upon his hind legs and desolated his
environment with an expression that
a plot was afoot to ruin Santa Clara
Valley.
People who think are not misled by
bo evident a pretense of indignation.
They understand that the item was
sent from here and that as to its ac
curacy the papers in the city had no
way to judge. The Associated Press
JUSTICE BEGGS
WAS IN ERROR

From Santa Clara

SAN JOSE, March 28. â Santa Clara
County was given judgment to-day
against Justice of the Peace Beggs of Los
Gatos for $297, illegally collected for fees
In criminal cases in Redwood Township.
Beggs was called in to sit in place of Jus
tice Dwyer of this city and Justice Her

tices Herring-ton and Dwyer also charged
the same amount. Suit was brought
against Beggs for $510 thus illegally col-
Judge Hyland to-day gave judgment for
the county for $279. He said the evidence
showed that Justice Beggs had unlaw
fully collected $3 in twenty cases in Jus
tice Herrlngrton's court and in seventy
nine cases in Justice Dwyer's court. The
decision says:

Death at Mountain View.
BAN JOSE. March 28.â John Francis, a
mining expert, whose home was at Moun
tain View, died yesterday after a linger
ing illness. He "was a native of Devon
shire, England, and 47 years old. He had
large mining interests in British Columuia
and California.
Sausalito Depot Robbery.
SAUSALITO, March 28.â The ticket of
fice of the North Pacific Coast Railroad
was entered at an early hour this morn-
Ing and jsi 50 in money and about 500
a tickets stolen. Most of the tickets have
been recovered. The burglars gained an
entrance to the ticket office by forcing the
door open with a jimmy.
Nonagenarian Passes Away
SAN JOSE. March 28.â Louis Callisch
Br., a pioneer of 1849 and an old resident of
this city, died this morning. He was a
nati*"Â» .Â°* Germany and &0 years ' of "a*Â©. "
correspondent had to be relied upon,
and to the extent he erred responsibil
ity must be placed at this end of the
line. If the damage was less serious
than at first reported, and so it seems
to have been, the friends of The Call
here are sure that paper, assiduously
as it has worked for the interests of
Santa Clara, will be gratified to know it
and to spread the news abroad.
"It is not easy to conceive," con
tinues this editorial freak, "what The
Call has against San Jose."
So a number of citizens seen here to
day freely admit.
"The Mercury must have gone daft,"
said one of these. â¦'If 'Jim' Rea thinks
he can delude anybody by such stuff
he's a chump. I had always given him
credit for sense. We all understand
what is the matter. Your paper has
been fighting him and beating him at
every turn. Job after job of his has
been laid bare. He is losing his gTip.
The Mercury also is on the downgrade,
and The Call is gaining here every day.
That's what ails â¢Jim.' I was not par
ticularly pleased at the item myself,
but seeing it in all the city papers
recognized that it must have been
Associated Press matter. Of course if
the frost had been as bad as reported
the fact would have been of grave im
portance, and no editor with any sense
would have suppressed It. There was
no reason for any of them to suppose
that it was not authentic. And Santa
Clara is not to be injured by any frost.
This is a great and productive section,
and has no excuse for being super
sensitive."
This gentleman expressed the con
sensus of opinion as gathered by talks
with a large number of citizens. The
charge of "a deliberately premeditated
plan to discredit Santa Clara" tvas re
cognized as so ridiculous as to rob the
Mercury's vituperation of all weight
and dignity. That odd and unpleas
ant print seems to have a set of edi
torial fangs yet, but its poison sacks
have been removed. It has the im
pulses of the snake, but not the power.
This precious ebullition closes with
the assertion that "the attack and
the slander is one of the meanest ever
published against Santa Clara Coun
ty." As there has been no attack,
and as the "slander" came from a res
ident of Santa Clara, people here are
naturally inclined to smile. They arÂ«
serene in the confidence that an effort
to prove this valley anything but a de
sirable place of residence would be as
useless as to get out an injunction
against the rising of the sun, and their
faith in the friendship of The Call is
not to be shaken by the whine of a
boss on whom it has been necessary to
shed a light revealing him as a trick
ster unworthy of trust.
ABILA RANCH
IS FREEMAN'S
His Title Affirmed by
Judge Allen of Los
Angeles.
Attempt to Dispossess Him of
the Large Tract
Fails.
Decision in a Suit Involving the
Towns of Redondo and
Ingle wood.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 28.â Superior
Judge Allen to-day rendered a decision
affirming the title of Daniel Freeman
to twenty-three hundred acres of val
uable land including the cities of Re
do-ndo and Inglewood. The ranch orig
inally belonged to Ignacio Ablla, who
died in 1850. Prior to his death he made
a will giving the ranch to his daughter,
Ascencion Sanchez. Her putative heirs
in 1865 sold the ranch to a man named
Burnett. The sale was approved by
the Probate Court and Burnett ob
tained quit-claim deeds from all the
supposed heirs of Ascencion Sanchez,
then alive. In 1885 Burnett sold the
ranch to Its present owner, Daniel
Freeman, and ita present value Is
$1,000,000.
In the meantime a company was
formed, known as the Abila Estate
Company, to contest the title of Free
man to the ranch. The claim to the
property was based upon the allegation
that Ascencion Sanchez had two chil
dren by Don Pio Pico, and that their
Interest in the ranch as heirs of Ascen
cion Sanchez had never been quieted or
satisfied.
After hearing all the testimony to
day Judge Allen decided that the evi
dence was in no particular Instance
sufficient to cloud Freeman's title to
the ranch. He held that it had not been
proved beyond doubt that the two al
leped heirs of Ascencion Sanchez "were
her heirs, as the only testimr.-ny upon
which any such allepation could be
based was that of Don Pio Pico, the
last Mexican ("Hvernor of California.
who had claimed that he was the
father of two children of whom Ascen
cion Sanchez was the mother. This
Judee Allen did not consider good evi
dence an"d he. therefore, grave a deci
sion in favor of the defendant.
Requisition for Dr. Forrest.
SACRAMENTO. March 28.â Governor
Budd to-day granted the request of Gov
ernor Black of New York. through that
State's agent, James Price, for a requisi
tion for the return of Dr. 'William B. For
rest, who is now under arrest in Los An
geles, having been taken into custody for
fleecing numerous residents of New York
on bogus Investments. The specific charge
upon which the requisition was â¢ granted
was that of fleecing a man named Robert
.T. Freeman out of $5000. Price left for Los
Ansreles this afternoon for hi 3 prisoner.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 29, 1898.
THE INTERIOR
LINE OF WORKS
Rifled Artillery for Angel
Island and Alcatraz
Batteries.
The Position at Lime Point to
Be Re-enforced by Eight-
Inch Guns.
Preparations to Destroy Any Hostile
Ship That Might Pass the Outer
Line of Defense.
In order to be prepared for any emer
gency, General Shafter, commanding the
Department of California, has decided to
strengthen the fortifications of Lime
Point and Angel Island. In a big engage
ment at the heads one Ironclad of an en
emy might, by some one of the many
chances of war, run by the batteries of
Fort Point and get Inside. In that event
the batteries of Angel Island, Alcatraz
and Lime Point might be able to render
great service.
It is proposed now to place on Alcatraz
and Angel islands eight-inch .converted
j rifles. These guns do not have a long
I range, as modern rifles are estimated, but
the rifles shoot with remarkable precision
and are highly effective at short dis
tances. They will be kept in readiness for
active service until the new modern high
power guns are received to supplant them.
It is said that General Shafter will also
re-enforce the battery of twelve-inch
breech-loading guns at Lime Point with
a new battery of eight-inch converted
rifles. Old artillerymen have the greatest
faith in these eight-inch guns. They re
fer to the records of target practice to
prove the accuracy of the shooting.
The usual monthly muster and review
of the troops at the Presidio will take
place next Thursday. If the weather is
fair and agreeable all the troops of the
garrison will be reviewed on the parade
plain. At the Presidio and other garri
sons of San Francisco harbor the war
! preparations have been carried forward
jas far as the emergency demands. The
j signs of peace now reported from the
East will not cause a cessation of work
lon the fortifications. New guns will be
1 mounted as fast as they arrive and work
i will be continued throughout on the main
plan df harbor defense as mapped out by
I the engineer corps.
i A quantity of ammunition, 40,000 pounds,
j has been sent to San Diego to supply the
i 10-lnch breech-loading rifles at Ballast
j Point. Colonel Moore, the chief quarter
' master of this department, is at San
I Diego arranging some matters of trans
: portation in connection with the works
defending that harbor.
The funeral of Miss Anna Morris,
| daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Morris,
I Fourth Cavalry, took place at the Pre
1 sldio yesterday. Miss Morris had been a
sufferer for many years and her death,
, la^t Saturday, came as a release. She
; was an accomplished young lady, who
1 was highly esteemed by her associates.
' The interment took place at the National
i Cemetery at the Presidio. The pall
j bearers were chosen from the second
! lieutenants of the garrison. The men of
I the Fourth Cavalry followed the funeral
procession on foot.
IT WILL BE A
GRAND FETE
Enthusiastic Committees Pre
paring for the Masonic
Festival.
Assurances Given That the Widows
and Orphans' Home Will Be
Completed.
The Masonic festival that is to be given
lat the Mechanics' Pavilion, beginning on
May 9 and lasting for six days, is now an
assured success. The affair is to be given
for the benefit of the proposed home for
the widows and orphans of deceased
members of the organization. Commit
tees are daily hard at work, and yester
day the headquarters of the officers in
charge of the entertainment were crowded
with enthusiastic workers for the benefit
of the fete. Among the callers was In
spector-General \V. Frank Pierce, one of
the foremost Masons of the State, and he
was much pleased with the progress al
ready made in the arrangements for the
entertainment. He prophesied that the
fair would realize all the money that
would be needed to complete the home
and put it in a condition for occupancy.
He said there would be several thousand
Masons in attendance at the fete from
the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys,
and they would also donate many beauti
ful articles to place in the booths for sale.
The different city lodges have taken a
wonderful interest in the proposed enter
tainment. The Oakland Masons have al
ready given over a hundred handsome ar
ticles to h^lp stock the booths. The wives
of the members of California Lodge will
meet on Wednesday afternoon to arrange
for taking an active part in the festival
and on Thursday the ladies of Fidelity
Lodge will meet to prepare for their part
in the fete. Both meetings will be held at
the Masonic Temple. Charles L. Patton,
the chairman of the committee in charge
of the festival, says he expects to sell at
least 20,Cw0 season tickets, and he ex
presses the belief that the affair will be
one of the greatest Masonic successes
ever held in this State.
Holding the Fort.
The contempt of court proceedings in
the suit of the Pokegame Lumber Com
pany vs. The Klamath Lumber Company
were continued yesterday by United
States Circuit Judge Morrow. The Kla
math people still hold the mill and other
improvements in spite of the restraining
order issued by the court, and have ten
men now guarding the works with Win
chester rifles.
To Commemorate the Passion.
A service in commemoration of the Pas
sion of the Redeemer will be given at St.
Stephen's Church this evening at 8
o'clock. An elaborate order of seryices
has been arranged.

SLOW SPEED
IS AN EVIL
Complaint That Mission
Property Is Hurt by-
Creeping Cars.
Petition Circulated Asking for
Faster Electric Car
Service.
Real Estate Men Say Tenants Make
Loud Complaints of the
Service.
There is a concerted movement of resi
dents of the Mission to induce the Mar
ket-street Railroad Company to Increase
the speed of caxs running to the Mission.
It is said by real estate dealers that
there has been a marked depreciation of
rental values since the cars began to run
bo slowly and that a great many work
ingmeu have signified a desire to move
nearer the center of the city.
Speaking of the matter yesterday, John
Hoesch said: "There is a general com
plaint about the slow way that the cars
are run, and a petition is being prepared
by residents asking that the company in
crease the speed of the electric cars. I
have not yet seen the document, though
I know it is being prepared. The cars
creep along nowadays, and this is hard
to bear, following rapid speed, as it
does. The real estate men say that there
is a slack in the Inquiries for Mission
property and that business out that way
has been greatly damaged oy the old
fogy policy that has bo suddenly lallea.
like a pail over the Mission."
George W. H. Patterson, real estate
dealer said: "There is a general com
plaint that the service is bad. We have
less inquiry than formerly for the prop
erty. Mechanics and others complain
that they have to get up too early to
catch cars. In the winter when it is dark
the complaint will grow worse instead of
better. I think there Is no need of the
slow run, and that there has been alto
gether too much emphasis laid on the
fact that lives have been lost by reason
of rapid running. L<?t the company adopt
the best fender it can get and leave the
rest to care and good judgment, and all
will be well." a ..
L A. Souc had l.e^rd the general com
plaint, but did not look for much en
couragement from the company. They
said there was much complaint among
patrons of the road, many of whom are
compelled to be up very early in the
morning. . ... ,
It is probable that there will soon be a
demonstration in favor of restoring some
Buch schedule as the one recently aban
doned, with the suggestion that the cars
run at a slower rate from Eighth street
in, and that ail conductor* be requested
to slow uy at crossings.
- LOVE LED TO SUICIDE.
Affection for His Divorced "Wife
Drove John Hohs to Self-
Murder.
Despondent over the lovo he bore for
hi 3 divorced wife, John F. Hohs com
mitted suicide yesterday by taking mor
phine. His landlady, Mrs. Katie Rinks,
went to vis room to make the bed at 4
o'clock in the afternoon, and found him
in an unconscious condition. She notified
a policeman, who i.ad the man taken to
the Receiving Hospital, where he died at
S o'clock. He told Dr. Thompson, who
attended -im. tuat ho had not taken
P< Among a number of letters which Hohs
left addressed to different people was one
to the Coroner, stating that he was tired
of life and had taken morphine. On the
back of two pictures of his 3-three-old
son appeared the following, written in
German: "Fredchen, my dear little boy,
what did your father do to harm your
mother? God bless you and take care of
you. Rememuer your father and avenge
his blood." To h.s wife he wivte: "Clara,
Clara, I have been good to j ou. I love
you even unto death, but you were false
to your husband, and you will rue it."
Hohs kept a small delicatessen-store- on
Howard street until about six weeks ago,
when he became a barkeeper at a saloon
on the corner of Seventh and Brannan.
Since then he has been rooming at 554 A
Natoma street, where he took the poison.
He and his wife had considerable trouble,
and about two weeks ago she was grant
ed a divorce on the grounds of extreme
cruelty. Hohs did not contest the case,
and friends think he has been grieving
over the separation until he became half
crazed.
The deceased was a German, 37 years of
age, and was a member of the Nord

NEARLY ENDED
IN BLOODSHED
Exciting Scene at the
Union Mission Army
Headquarters.
Commander Moore Threatens
to Kill W. J. Davis With
a Hatchet.
Troubles of the Army Will Be Again
Aired in Court, as Warrants Ara
Out for Moore's Arrest.
As a result of the disruption in the
Union Mission army there was a violent
Bcene at the headquarters. 114 Hayes
Btreet, Saturday night, nearly ending in
bloodshed.
The dismissal of the case against W.
J. Davis and his wife, charged by A. "W.
Moore, the self-styled commander, with
disturbing the peace, by Judge Low on
Saturday was celebrated with joyous ac
claims at the headquarters Saturday
night, much to the un-Christian rage and
mortification of Moore. In his anger
Moore wrote out notices that he was the
only commander of the army and warn
ing all and sundry not to have any deal
ings with the apostate Davis. He pro
ceeded to post the notices on the walls
of the headquarters, when Davis was no
tified by a friend and promptly tore the
notices down.
Moore had used a hatchet in posting up
the notices, and while Davis was pulling
them down he rushed at him and grasp
ing him by the throat with his left hand
raised the hatchet aloft as if to drive it
into Davis' skull. A bystander rushed be
tween them and forced the enraged
Moore to release his hold of Davis. Moore
then sullenly retired to his shack in the
rear of the headquarters.
Yesterday morning Davis appeared in
Judge Joachimsen's court and wanted a
warrant for the arrest of Moore on a
charge of assault to murder, but after
talking over the matter it was decided to
make the charge "threats to kill." Moore
had on previous occasions threatened to
strangle Davis if he did not give him ab
solute possession of the headquarters and
recognize him as the commander.
Attorneys Rose and Harrington, who
represent Davis, may also swear out a
warrant for Moore's arrest to-day on the
charge of obtaining money by false pre
tenses. They assert that Moore is going
around the city selling meal tickets and
appropriating the money to his own uses
and purposes. These meal tickets are made
good at the headquarters, and Davis and
the other members have to bear the ex-
Eense. They all bear the seal of the army,
ut Moore has his own seal as command
er, which the others allege is not guar
anteed or recognized by the army.
Davis' attorneys are also looking up
Moore's record, and they propose to show
Just what sort of a man he is when the
case comes up in court, including his do
ings in Portland, when he was expelled

A. "W. Moore was arrested in the even
ing on a warrant sworn to by. Major Da
vis, for threats to kill. The arrest, ac
cording to Moore, is a piece of spite work,
and the outcome of a misunderstanding.
Moore charged Davis with throwing a flag
and drum belonging to the mission into
the street and had him arrested for the
act. Moore denied that he had threatened
Davis, but says he only ordered him to
leave the mission.
ASKS FOB HEAVY DAMAGES.
Trial of Another Railroad Suit Com-
menced Before Judge Dainger
field and a Jury.
The trial of the suit brought by Margie
Nagle to recover $50,000 from the Market
street Railway Company was begun yes
terday before a Jury in Judge Dainger
field's court. She claims that she was
badly bruiseu and jarred by the sudden
stopping of a car of the Folsom-street
electric line on which she was a passenger
on February 7 last. The railroad com
pany denies that the plaintiff received
any injury, and, further, claims that the
car was stopped by the motorman in the
hope of preventing a collision with a
buggy crossing the track. The car and
buggy came together, however, and the
glass in the forward part of the dummy
was shattered.
Dr. Hall Again on Trial.

operation, was commenced yesterday in
Judge Dunne's court. Seven jurors were
secured yesterday, and it is expected that
the other five will be impaneled to-day.
On the former trial of the case the jury
was unable to agree.

A miner in Scranton, Perm., who has resided there all his life, and worked
in the coal mines ever since he waa a boy of fifteen, and consequently is pretty
1 well known to hundreds, says that the foul atmosphere he breathed tor so
many years in the mines, the gases, the damp and the cramped position in which
he had to work, caused his entire system to run down. "My etomach suffered
most," said he. "I wu induced to make trial of Ripans Tabules. and m a
month I was very much benefited. I mads a practicd of carrying a few of the
magic Tabules or Tablets in my pocket regularly, bo as to be able to ewallow one
on She first sign of approaching trouble ; but now. and for some time past. I
am, and have been, a perfectly well man. Many of my fellow miners are
familiar with my case, and not a few of them have learned to follow my example
and always keep two or three of the Tabules in an accessible pocket, and to take
one at the first sign of an internal disturbance or anything like a headache.'

SAN MATEO HIGHWAYS.
AN address, prepared by Commissioner John R.
Price, has just been issued by the Department
of Highways to the people of San Mateo
County on the condition of their roads and the pro
posed issue of bonds for the purpose of raising money
to improve them. The address is excellent in every
respect, and will undoubtedly have good effect in con
vincing the voters of the ad%isability of supporting a
movement of such importance to their welfare.
The argument of the address does not deal with the
advantages of good roads generally. It is directed
to the people of San Mateo, and confines itself closely
to the conditions of the roads there. Nevertheless it
ought to have a wide circulation throughout the
State, for the lessons taught in San Mateo are worth
learning elsewhere. In many other counties the con
ditions of the highways are essentially the same as in
the one to which the address is specifically directed,
and the reasons why San Mateo should vote bonds
for road improvements would be just as valid with
slight changes of statistics and names of localities if
applied to them.
One of the features of the address of general in
terest is the explanation of the necessity of bond is
sues for extensive road improvements. The law per
mits Supervisors to levy a tax not exceeding 40 cents
on the $100 for road purposes, and an act passed at
the last session of the Legislature authorizes a levy
of a special tax of 20 cents on the $100 for the im
provement of main public highways within each dis
trict. None of this can be expended in any district
other than the one in which the property tax was
levied. Under this system a rich district may improve
its highways, but a poor district is entirely helpless
and its road work is confined to small proportions by
reason of a lack of money.
As the address points out, it is this system that
prevents the connection of important points by good
roads. A poor and thinly settled district cannot afford
to pay the cost of constructing a grand highway
through its territory, however advantageous such
connection with richer districts might prove in the
long run. There is no method now provided by law
to overcome the difficulty except it be by a bond is
sue, and it is for that reason the work of road and
highway improvement in San Mateo is so largely de
pendent upon the result of the vote which is to be
taken on the proposed i^sue.
It is not to be denied that all sections of San Mateo
will be benefited by the construction of the grand
thoroughfare to connect the main high road system
of San Francisco with that of Santa Clara, and also
by the opening of a good wagon road from the San
Francisco line to that of Santa Cruz. These benefits
being certain and the fact being clear that the only
way to obtain them is by bond issue, it can hardly
need further argument to convince the voters of San
Mnteo that good business sense is on the side of the
bond proposition. At any rate, the address by reason
of its comprehensive study of road work and highway
conditions in San Mateo is a valuable contribution to
the statistical literature of the State, and the Highway
Commissioners deserve commendation for the work
of preparing and publishing it.
Thomas H. Kerr, in a communication to this paper,
printed yesterday morning, takes the position that if
the Cubans do not like the way they are treated they
have only to demonstrate that they are loyal to Spain.
Mr. Kerr's philosophy is so convincing it is a wonder
it had not been sooner advanced. If the martyrs -of
old found the process of being burned unpleasant
they could have avoided it and died raw, of old age.
by casting aside the faith for which they were willing
to die. Furthermore, Mr. Kerr overlooks the really
important truth that the people being starved in Cuba
are not insurgents nor the families of insurgents, but
"pacificos," who have no desire to fight, and have
been driven from their little farms to the towns lest
something they raised might go to the sustenance of
the native troops.
There does not seem to be any occasion for the
services of a mediator between this country and
Spain so far as the Maine is concerned. The matter
has been left to the honor of Spain, and as Spain has
filled a history while demonstrating that she has no
honor, it may be considered as laid on the table.
Perhaps it is a mere superstition to look upon the
battle-ship Texas as a hoodoo, and yet a country with
the interests of its navy at heart can but hope that
sooner or later the Texas would conquer its inclina
tion to cut across lots.
When the Duke of Veragua termed McKinley "an
ignorant sutler" he breathed that sweet spirit of fra
ternity which seems about to result in peace with a
whole lot of honor.
SOME ALASKAN PROBLEMS.
THERE arc two features of the Alaskan situation
which require the immediate attention of the
authorities at Washington. The first of these is
the settlement of the dispute over the boundary line
between Alaska and the Canadian territory, and the
second is the establishment of a postal route to the
Klondike country.
The Canadian officials have not waited for the
boundary line to be settled before fixing their cus
toms depots on the outermost line of their claims.
Reports came from Juneau some time ago that Cana
dian customs officers had established themselves on
the summit of the passes over the mountains behind
Dyea, and these reports have now been amply con
firmed. Canada has taken an advanced position, and
will hold it until the final settlement of the boundary
dispute.
Governor Brady of Alaska and Collector Ivey re
cently went over the trail from Dyea for the purpose
of making an official investigation of the position
taken by the Canadians, and found them located as
had been reported. Ivey's instructions from Wash
ington were to post two sub-collectors of the United
States customs service at Lake Bennett, but Captain
Belcher, who was in charge of the Canadian mounted
police on the summit, informed them that they could
not do so. He had assumed his station on the moun
tains by instructions from his superiors, and therefore
could not consent to the establishment of an Ameri
can customs depot within the lines claimed by hi 3
Government.
The point of controversy is one of growing import
ance by reason of the rapidly increasing trade and
business of the Klondike country. It was announced
a short time ago that arrangements for fixing the
boundary had been agreed upon by the two nations,
but this was afterward denied. In view of the action
of the Canadian Government it is clear that further
delay in determining the boundary is likely to lead
to a conflict that may make a burning issue
out of something which could now be settled with
ease. This, therefore, is the time to deal with the
matter and put an end to the dispute.
The establishment of an adequate postal service is
hardly less imperative than the settlement of the
boundary. According to the latest reports no mail
has been received at Dawson since last September.
Complaints have been made that even at Dyea the
postomce officials have exacted a fee for delivering
mails, and that the service has been used as a means
of extorting money from the public.
This condition of affairs is something of a Gov
ernmental disgrace. The trade of Alaska and the
Klondike country demands mail facilities, and it will

THE VALUE OF FORESTS.
A WRITER connected with the Department of
Agriculture says that at the present rate of
destruction there will be hardly a forest tree
left in this country in fifty years.
We have already called attention to this subject in
noticing the summer session of the Forestry Con
gress to be held in this State next July. The Presi
dent has just proclaimed another great timber reser
vation in the San Bernardino mountains in Southern
California.
The reservations in this State are now so extensive
as to demand the application to them, most actively,
of the principles of forestry. We hope this will be
discussed by the coming congress. It will not do to
reserve immense forest tracts and then let nature take
her course. The exclusion of stock increases the
amount of combustible material on the forest floor,
while it is made necessary to preserve the sprouting
timber which is to make the future crop. This
crop, however, is equally sure of devastation by fire
in the accumulation of duff and dried grasses.
These reservations cannot be effectively protected
against fire by mere exclusion of shepherds, herds
men and campers. It is known that forest fires occur
in our mountains from lightning in the not infrequent
thunderstorms that occur in the dry season. It will
prove to be necessary that measures be taken to re
move the dead and fallen timber, the fallen leaves
and resinous cones which drop after they have opened
and spilled their seeds, and to penetrate and surround
especially valuable timber tracts with wide roads,
than which there is no better preventive of the spread
of fire.
In Europe all of these things are done by trained
foresters, who graduate in special schools and con
stitute a branch of the regular civil service of the
State. When we have advanced sufficiently in forestry
and the open timber is so destroyed as to make
necessary the commercial use of timber within the
reservations, its harvest under preservative regula
tions may be leased to mill men, who will pay stump
age for the privilege, and thus provide an income to
meet the expense of preserving the timber and pro
moting its growth on these reservations.
The manufacture of wood pulp is reaching im
mense proportions in the United States. A thousand
plants are now engaged in this business. The very
paper on which this article is printed was but recently
a green tree. The wood used for pulp is generally
of the sorts not favored for lumber or dimension
timber. In securing pulping trees the same destruc
tive methods are followed as in lumbering. The pulp
woods arc being rapidly exhausted, while the demand
for pulp is as rapidly increasing. Under these con
ditions forestry must be resorted to for information
as to the propagation and preservation of the pulp
woods. If properly treated the forests which furnish
it can be kept producing, and soon the product will
become a very valuable and important article of ex
port.
The trees now used are spruce, poplar, pine, hem
lock, bass wood, balsam, cypress, birch, maple, beech,
buckeye and gum. We have the most of them here.
The buckeye especially abounds and has not here
tofore attracted attention for its economic possibili
ties. It is a rapid grower, thrives in rocky and
unpromising situations, has high resistance to
aridity, bears nuts abundantly, and its propa
gation may become very interesting and profit
able. The spruce forests of the State are
considerable, and, by reason of their winged
seeds, are persistent and capable of spreading, pro
vided they are protected from fire. From this source,
aso, revenue may be derived to maintain a system of
forestry. The adaptation of such system to our laws,
form of government and popular habits is a subject
of the keenest interest, and its immediate discussion
by foresters and lawyers is very necessary.
There appears to be reason for the statement sent
by telegraph that the President will not waver. Spain
seems to be in a mood to do all the wavering neces
sary. â  #
It was a fine little war cloud, but it seemed to lack
the element of stability.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 29, IS9B.
PROTECT THE UNWARY.
OBSERVING persons cannot have failed to
notice that there is a tinge of medievalism in
the religious zealotry with which the police
of many American cities is now occasionally com
pelled to deal. That this zeal is largely commercial
no longer admits of doubt. The success of the Salva
tion Army, with its uniforms and military organiza
tion, its tambourine bands and marching women, has
revived among a certain impressionable class oi
Americans some of the spirit which animated the
Crusaders and which, even in the enlightened days,
may yet send armed men out to fight a less formid
able individual than the Turk.
The basis of the Salvation Army is sound finance.
Its officers are mostly paid and its credit is well recog
nized throughout the United States and Great Brit
ain. The contest for control which lately took place
at New York between members of the Booth family
resembled a dispute among Roman Bishops in the
early days of Christianity. The American wing of the
army rebelled against the fiscal management of the
British wing. The foreign Booths wanted to handle
all the money. This was deemed to be un-American,
and, in order to save the organization on this side of
the water, the elder Booth was obliged to concede
the establishment here of a Salvation Army military
chest.
It is not at all surprising that the success of the
Salvationists should have given life to other religious
"armies." But it Is a somewhat striking circum
stance that many of the imitators of the Salvation
Army possess a fraudulent character. In this city it
is of record that crime has actually been committed
in the name of an organization called the "Army of
Jesus Christ." That the men who were unearthed by
the police in this case were animated by religious fer
vor is impossible. They were like the Roman wolves
who adopted the hooded cloak and learned the secrets
of the Christians, only to betray them to the bloody
Cesars.
There may be and probably are sincere people in
all the semi-military societies now being organized
throughout the country in imitation of the Salvation
Army. But that many of them, like the "Army of
Jesus Christ," are being launched for purposes of
plunder is extremely probable. One of these societies
is called the "Army of Heaven at Hand." Its leaders
promise immediate paradise at reduced rates; that is,
where it costs a couple of dollars a month to belong
to other "armies," and secure future salvation, bliss
on the spot is guaranteed for four bits.
Of course this is absurd. But proof that it is not
too absurd to secure followers is not wanting. Under
the constitution religious freedom is guaranteed.
Every man may seek happiness and salvation by
whatever means he pleases. But it cannot be denied
that the efforts of designing men to prey upon the
zealotry of the people ought to be regulated by some
body. No one believed that such an institution as the
Salvation Army could grow powerful in America un
til the physical fact became apparent. Now that the
presence among us of large numbers of people who
should have lived in the middle ages is established
measures should be taken to protect them from irre
sponsible and insincere religionists.
PUT DOWN BY PL^IN FACTS.
AS may be noted by a glance at the telegraphic
columns this morning a San Jose paper in a
fit of malign hysteria has been accusing The
Call of an attempt to injure the material interests of
Santa Clara Valley. While under ordinary circum
stances a charge so foolish would not be worth notic
ing, coming as it does from a paper about which
there yet lingers a vanishing remnant of decency and
which still remembers the day when it had a measure
of respectability and influence, it might tend to give
a false impression.
The Mercury is the puilty sheet. It is run by a
discreditable political boss named Rea. The Call has
been active in laying bare the corruption of which
Rea is the source and the center, and is pleased to
have stirred up much indignation among his follow
ers. It has even caused an impulse of anger t ruffle
the brow of Rea, and, as the truth wa the only weap
on used against him, naturally he turned to falsehood
as his available instrument. While never very effec
tive, it was the one with which he was familiar.
The paper which is the medium between Rea and a
limited portion of the public also has grievances. It
has noted with pain that The Call has become a
force in its territory. It has observed the pretenses
of the Rea gang held up to the light, and its own
power waning, as the true character of the forces be
hind it came to be understood. Hence the wild and
silly attack upon The Call; an attack founded osten
sibly upon a dispatch sent out by the Associated
Press, of which the agent in San Jose is city editor
of the Mercury, but really founded on a malevolent
hatred born of iniquity exposed. It Was the wail of
the enmeshed rascal, the expression of disregard
made by the rogue who has begun to feel the halter
draw.
THE CATTLE QUARANTINE.
IT is gratifying to learn by a dispatch from Sacra
mento that the restrictions of the national quaran
tine which have been so prejudicial to the cattle
industry of the southern part of the State have, in a
iarge measure, been set aside, and that it will now be
possible for cattlemen to remove their stock from the
districts where the drought prevails to points north
of the quarantine line, where there is good pasture for
them.
The removal of the southern cattle northward will
not in any way injure the northern industry, for the
cattle from that section can be removed if desired
across the State line. Thus the way is open to obtain
abundant rood fo- all, and the menace of loss which
confronied the cattlemen is overcome. The relief is
timely and will result in an immense saving to one
of the great interests of the commonwealth.
The Call directed attention to the importance of
some sucn relief as this a few days ago, and at that
time pointed out the need of a thorough revision of
the whole quarantine system. What has been accom
plished flow by the energies of Governor Budd and
the Sece.ary of the State Board of Health in pressing
the subjtct upon the consideration of the Secretary
of Agriculture provides relief which seems ample foi
the present emergency, but it is likely that even more
could be 'ittaineii by a persistent demand fof a reform
in the law as a whole.
The drought of the season has brought the evil
effects of the law as it stands clearly before the people,
md. while the airo-nt of relief granted h most grati
fying, the issue should not be allowed to pass from
public attention until all the arguments of the cattle
men have had a full hearing at Washington and all
their rightful claims satisfied.
The public would be glad to learn that Zola was
to have a new trial. It is speaking mildly indeed to
say that the one he had was a farce.

THE BRITISH NAVAL ESTIMATES
Great Â±>ritait, in its efforts to create
and maintain a navy equal at least to
the combined navies of two of the C<m
tinental powers is put to such an ex
pense as to maie It doubtful if the limit
of expen, urea .n that direction has not
been reached. The naval, estimates are
now nearly 80 per cent larger than they
were ten years ago, and the personnel
has been Increased over 70 per cent since
ISSS-S9. The statement of the First Lord
of the Admiralty explaining- the navy
estimates for IS9S-99 was 'presented to
Parliament on MaTch 3, and contains in
the briefest possible language the opera
tions for the past year and the pro
gramme for the ensuing fiscal year. Tak
ing the estimates now submitted, and
those of ten years ago it should be re
membered that while the votes for 1895-96
were 50 per cent hijrnor than in 1888-89,
the total has now riser, to $20.357,000 above
that of 1595-96.

in the dockyards from 20,858, receiving
$6,906,446 ten years since, to 26,340 with a
pay of $9,265,220, indicates that the dock
yards are being utilized batter than a de
cade ago.
The most notable part of the First
Lord's statement Is that relating to new
construction. It is proposed to com
mence three battleships, four armored
cruisers and four sloops, all three of the
battleships and two of the sloops to
be built in the dockyards. Including these
new orders the following vessels will be
under construction or completion during
1898-99: namely: Twelve battleships, six
teen first-class cruisers, six seciind-clasa '
cruisers, ten third-class cruisers, si*
sloops, four twin-screw gunboats, forty
one torpedo boat destroyers and one royal
yacht, making ninety-six vessels In all,
or nearly as many as there are in the
United States navy, with a large pre
ponderance of tonnage for Great Britain.
T.he labor troubles from July, 1597, up to
February last were a great drawback to
contractors and dockyards, and the naval
programme of last year was greatly re
duced in its actuality. In the coming
year all of the torpedo boat destroyers
will be completed, and at least three bat
tleships and eight first-class cruisers will
be placed In commission.
Steady progress is being made In naval
ordnance, improved quick-firing guns of
six inches are under contract, and all tha
breech-loaders of that caliber will have
been converted Into quick-firers six
months hence. Corvite Is gradually re
placing ordinary gunpowder, and new
small arms have been provided, while
earlier types of torpedoes have been with
drawn and replaced with modern ones.
The British navy in Its material and per
sonnel has undergone a complete trans
formation in the past ten years at a vast
expense, but it has yet to prove its sup
posed superiority; perhaps even Its utility.

Sergeant "Tom" Mahoney of the Har

seems to be a regular Lothario. It is
only a few weeks ago that he ran away
with a married woman from Petaluma,
but her husband caught them at the fer
ries when they went back after their
trunks. He then went to Santa Rosa, and
has run away with a 17-year-old girl
named Sadie Williams. As the couple did
not come down on the San Francisco and
North Pacific train the chances are they
traveled by tne Southern Pacific route.

What appeared to bÂ© a pretty job to
give a contracting firm an easy proposi
tion was nipped in the bud at the meeting
of the Board of Supervisors yesterday.
In the report of the Street Committee it
was recommended that the repavlng of
Third street, between Mission and How
ard be let to the firm of Fllnn & Treacy
for the sum of J2IOO. Before a vote could
be taken on the report Mayor Phelan dis
covered that John J. Dowling had made a
bid of $900 for the same work.
" He called attention to this fact, and Su
pervisor Britt at once took the floor In
! defense of the contract. He stated that
i Contractor Dowling had represented to
him that he had made a serious mistake
i in figuring on the work; uiat fie desired
j his bid withdrawn, and it would work a
grievous injustice on him if he were com
pelled to carry out the contract.
It was finally decided to give Dowling a
chance to appear before the Street Com
mittee on Thursday next and explain his
position in the matter and to defer action
on the subject until the committee can
make a report.
Supervisor Smitn Introduced a resolu
tion regarding the giving out of public
printing which he said was intended to
fix the responsibility in the matter. The
law requires that outside of the notices
that must be published In the official pa
per a certain amount of printing must be
given to other daily publications. Super
visor Sheehan made a motion that the
surplus public printing be distributed
among all the other daily papers except
1 Such* a course was opposed by Super
visor Sritt. who said that he had been
well treated by the business office of the
Examiner and did not propose to see the
paper suffer becaues there was a crooked
individual in charge of the editorial de
! partment â¢ ,
A motion to place the disposal of public
printing in the hands of the clerk of the
board was defeated and it was finally de
cided to let the matter go over two weeks
in order to give the members a chance to
investigate.
Mr. Britt has the contract for the
plumbinig in the new Examiner building.
Police Commissioner M. A. Gunst was
given a leave of absence for six months,
with permission to leave the State. It la
understood that he will return to Carls-
Lad to continue medical treatment that
was begun some months ago.
Mayor Phelan presented a veto of reso
lution 815 empowering the City Engineer
to prepare plans and specifications for the
completion of the main sewer south of
Golden Gate Pack. He stated that the
charges proposed for the work were cx
i cessive and that the members of the Cali-
I fornia Association of Civil Engineers had
proposed to do the work for less than
half of the charge that it was Intended to
i make.

HOFF APPEARS
HALF-HEARTED
Will Attempt to Prove an
Alibi to Establish His
Innocence.
The Testimony Thus Far Given
In His Behalf Is Far From
Strong.
Will To- Day Tell the Jury of His
Movement! on .the Day of the
Murder.
The trial of Albert Hcff, accused of the
murder of Mrs. Mary Clute in her home
at 803 Guerrero street, will be concluded
this week, as the defense has but few
witnesses to call. Hoff took the witness
stand late yesterday afternoon, but had
not conclulded his direct examination
when the hour of adjournment arrived.
He proved a very garrulous witness and
notwithstanding the instructions and in
junctions of his counsel insisted on going
into the minutest details concerning mat
ters that have no direct bearing on the
case.
When the trial was resumed yesterday
morning Attorney W. H. Schooler made
the opening statement for the defense.
He said that he expected to prove that
Hoff had led an ordinary life during his
residence here and had never given any
evidence of being possessed of a brutal
instinct, such as must have governed the
acts of the murderer of Mrs. Clute. He
said that he also expected to show that
Hoft left the house about 4:30 o'clock on
the afternoon of the murder and that
Foley and Jackson were laying carpets
in a front room at the time. Hoff was to
return the following day to assist Mr*.
Clute in hanging the pictures and tapes
try after the carpets were laid. The
wound on Hoff's hand, which the police
claim was caused by a Jagged end of the
coupling pin used by the murderer, he
said was caused by a tack in a piece of
carpet Hoff had unrolled for Mrs. Clute
to ascertain if it would fit the hallway.
The first two witnesses called were Mrs.
Masterson and Mrs. Wagner, who had at
times employed Hoff. The testimony
given by them was of a negative charac
ter. They simply testified that they had
never seen a coupling pin in the posses
sion of Hoff. Mrs. Wagner testified that
she had twice opened Hoff's tool bag,
once to get some screws and another
time to get some tacks. Had there been
a coupling pin in it she would have seen
it.
The next two witnesses were very ma
terial in support of the alibi Attorney
Schooler expects to prove.
Robert Goepel, a shoemaker living in
the Western Addition, testified that Hoff
was in his store at 5:15 o'clock on the
evening 1 of the murder. Just about the
time Mrs. Clute met her death.
Goepel on cross-examination admitted
that he had been questioned by tho po
lice just after the murder.
"E>id you tell the police about that
meeting?" asked Assistant District At
torney Hosmer.
"I did not." replied Goepel. "This is
the first time I ever told it." he added.
Goepel had no explanation for so long
remaining silent on that vital point in
Hoff's defense.
The next material witness was Henry
Neimeyer, a clerk in the'Lindell House.
He testified to having seen Hoff about 6
o'clock on the evening of the murder and
giving him some mall.
Hoff took the stand and told of his ac
quaintance with Mrs. Clute. He said that
he had worked for her on several occa
sions and that she had sent for him to as
sist her in moving from 320 Page street
to 803 Guerrero, where she was murdered.
He detailed at length how he had taken
down pictures and draperies for her- and
had been engaged by her to assist in put
ting them up in her new home. He had
just reached the point in his narrative of
getting to the Guerrero street house at
about 1 o'clock on the afternoon of the
murder when Judge Cook declared a re
cess until this morning.
BOILEB-MAKEBS UNEASY.
A Strike at the Union Iron Works
for an Advance of Wages
Seriously Contemplated.
The boiler-makers at the Union Iron
Works are anything but satisfied at the
rate of wages paid by that Institution,
and as a consequence a strike is in con
templation. ,
The tip went out that the strike would
take place yesterday morning, and as a
safeguard the management had a force
of police near at hand to quell any dis
turbance that might take place. But
their 6er%'ices were not required as the
strike did not come gff. Nevertheless
there Is an uneasiness about the big
works, and It is thought that by the first
of the month something may drop that
will have the effect of suspending work
in the boiler-makers' department until the
difference is adjusted. \
The boiler-makers at the Union Iron
Works are being paid at the rate of $3 25
a day, whereas the union rate of wages
is established at $3 50 a day. The manage
ment at the Union Iron Works consider
that as their shops run the entire year
round the men are better off at a slight
reduction when they are assured work
the entire year than to take .he chance*
of being laid off several months in the
year, as is customary In other institu
tions in the city.
BEFUSED A LANDING.
Fifteen More "Farmer Students'
Must Go Back to the Bice Fields

John Lynch, D. J. O"Leary and E. A. .
Holmes, constituting the special board of

yesterday with United States Immigra
tion Commissioner North their report re
fusing a landing to. fifteen Japanese la
borers who arrived on the steamer Belgic
on February 23. None of the immigrants
had more than $40 50, and they told the
old story of being "farmer students" de
siring to study farming in California by
walking from ranch to ranch, depending i
for support u^on remittances which they ,
expected to receive from poor relatives in
Japan.

WASTED ALL
HER FORTUNE
Mrs. W. B. Hellings Tells
of Her Marital Un
happinees.
Why She Was Compelled to
Separate From Her Hus
band.
Justice of the Peace Barry Laughs at
the Idea of Alienating the
Lady's Affections.
There was an expectant crowd in Judge
Campbell's court yesterday morning in
anticipation of hearing the evidence-in me
case of W. B. Hellings, the San Pablo
rancher, charged with threatening to kill
his wife. They were disappointed.
Justice of the Peace Groezinger, in the
absence of Judge Campbell, occupied the
bench, and by consent of Prosecuting At
torney Spinetti and Keel J3. Terry for the
prosecution and Frank Shea for the de
fendant the case was continued for a
week.
Mrs. Hellings, wno Is a daughter of the
late Judge Solomon O. Heydenfeidt, has
been induced to give her version of her
marital unhapplness. "I married," she
said, "ten years ago. I had heard that
my husband was wealthy, but I do not
know as i have never seen any of his
money. I had my own income then, and X
applied it from time to time to the sup
port of our family. From the day 1 mar
ried him, I did nothing but raise money to
pay off the fast accumulating liabilities
on the ranch. I borrowed and spent at j
my husband's request until about two ]
years ago, when I found that I had noth- j
ing left. I often begged and implored, mv i
husband not to force me to spend all my
fortune, but he would not listen to me.
Money ha would have and I must get it
for him. At last when my property was
all mortgaged up to the limit and I could
not get more he wanted me to go and ob
tain money from my brothers.
"Two years ago we separated by mutual
consent. Since then I have been depen- )
dent for the support of myself and family
upon my brothers, who have cheerfully j
aided me. My husband has been In the
habit of coming over to visit me Saturday i
and I have always been at home to re- I
ceive him, but it has been a life of con- i
tinual threats and abuse. More than once !
he has threatened my lire.
"As to the Barrys, they are old friends.
My father and Mr. Barry Sr. came to this
country together, and when Mrs. Barry
lay dying a few months ago, she sent for
me and asked me to see as much of the
family as possible. Since then Mr. Barry
Sr. and hia two sons have lived to
gether, with their aunt, Mrs. Williams, to
keep house for them. I have visited them i
constantly, often stopping for dinner. On '
such occasion the eldest son, Justice of ;
the Peace Barry, would see me home, and !
sometimes I would ask him to step In and
rest a while.
"A servant I once had carried tales of |
my visits to my husband. She told him
colored versions of my actions and he be
lieved them. Once, by Mrs. "Williams' re
quest. I remained at the house all night, i
and the woman told ray husband that I j
had been out all night with some one. !
That is how the whole trouble arose. He j
began to threaten and abuse me and I of- j
fered to do anything to prove my inno- .
cence, but he would not listen, and it has j
come to such a pass now that I must be
protected from his violence."
Justice of the Peace Barry corroborates â 
Mrs. Hellinps' story and says that the j
idea of Hellinsrs charging him with alien
ating his wife's affections is preposterous.
Unable to Meet Their Bills.
Cora Graham, living at 111 Mason street,
yesterday filed a petition in Insolvency.
She owes $1763 60. and has no assets.
William Wedgewood , a manufacturing 1
machinist, has failed for $6320 60.

HINTS TO ATHLETES.
Suggestions About Training and
Keeping the Body in Good
Condition.
Never continue exercise long 1 enough to
produce fatigue. Stop when you feel tired.
Don't over-exert yourself to gain mus
cle. Remember that every muscle has its
limits beyond which It cannot be devel
oped.
Indian clubs arÂ» the most effective for
giving one grace, ease and accuracy of
movement, features which every athlete
should strive to cultivate.
Bicycling has become a popular exercise
and undoubtedly furnishes, in addition to
muscular development, great exhilaration.
Dumb bells, if properly used, strengthen
the muscles of the arms and incidentally
those of the body and legs. They also ex
pand the chest and broaden the shoulders.
After exercise a cool shower spray or
bath should be taken, not to last more
than one qr two minutes and should be
followed by a brisk rub to tone up the
system and encourage the circulation of
the blood. Some pure stimulant should
also be used. Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey
is used by prominent athletes for this
purpose and is highly recommended.
It should be noted, however, that only a
pure and medicinal malt like Duffy's will
be of service. Ordinary whiskey will not
answer the purpose and you Bhould be.
certain to secure the genuine.

NEXT TO
THE LOWEST
BIDDER
A Rank Deal in the
Repair of Third
Street.
Facts and Figures Show
That the City Is Being
Plundered.
New Work Throughout Can
Be Done for Less Than Cost
of Repairing.
THE BIDS WERE JUGGLED
How the Schema "Was Planned by
the Contraotors and the Street
Committee.
The universal desire of the people of
San Francisco for smooth and sub
stantial pavements to replace the old
blocks and worn-out macadam causes
general approval of new street work.
Tax-payers are inclined to accept any
thing new as 1 -tter than the old, and
have not been very particular in mak-
ing inquiries to ascertain facts concern-
Ing cost of new work or compliance
with specifications.
The disclosures recently made In The
Call show that the Supervisors and the
Street Department are letting out im
portant Jobs without regard to the pro
visions of the law on the subject. The
Superintendent of Streets takes it upon
himself, at the suggestion perhaps of
gome one of th<_ board, to enter into a
private arrangement for important
work in front of city property. The
favored contractor goes to the property
owners against whom one-half of the
cost of the improvement should be as
sessed and says: # ;Sign for this im
provement and we will make the price
low to you. What we lose on your half
we will make up in assessment against
the city's half." Objection being out of
the way the Street Superintendent and
favored contractor proceed to make a
private arrangement. When the law
is invoked against payment for work
so conducted and engineered the Super
visors step in and authorize the im
provement by regular resolution of in
tention, but this regular authority is
not given until the work has been per
formed. The proposed public competi
tion is therefore a sham. The favored
contractor who has already done the
work puts in a public bid at the private
figures and the other contractors who
have been posted stay off. This viola
tion uf the law is known to the Mayor
and Auditor, but they do not seem to
have the power to prevent the payment
for work contracted or bargained for in
this loose and unlawful manner.
On other contracts let in an appar
ently regular manner the city frequent
ly gets the rough end of the deal. A
recent job on Third street, between
Mission and Howard, is a case in point.
The accepted bituminous pavement of
this block needed repairs. It was pro
posed, therefore, that the bitumen
should be removed and the concrete
foundation repaired. The Board of Su
pervisors proceeded in the regular fash
lon, as the law requires, to invite
bids. There were five bidders, to wit:
city Street Improvement Company,
Flinn & Treacy, Union Paving and Con
tracting Company, San Francisco Pav
ing Company and J. J. Dowling.
The lowest bid. $950, was that of J. J.
PoMling. He also agreed to pay $75
/or Â«fee old bitumen. The next lowest
bid was that of Flinn & Treacy, $2100
id $1 for the old material. The Board
vi Supervisors on the recommendation
cf the Street Committee rejected all
thÂ« bids. Dowling told the Supervis
ors that he was mistaken on the prop
osition and hence put in a bid lower
than he Intended. Whatever the in-
Blde arrangement was, the fact stands
that the Street Committee rescinded the
resolution rejecting all the bids and
adopted a resolution rejecting Dow
ling's bid and then recommended the
award of contract to Flinn & Treacy
for $2100. Dowling was perfectly will
ing to have his bid rejected.
Now, as a matter of fact, Dowling's
bid of $950 and $76 for the old material
was a pretty fair estimate of the work
required. The repairs to the concrete
â will not cost over $50, which would
leave him 7 cents a square foot for re
placing the bitumen. Counting one in
tersection and deducting the street rail
road company's space there remains
to be repaved 15,760 square feet. Flinn
& Treacy's bid is at the rate of 15 cents !
a square foot, counting on the old ma
terial to be worth $2 a ton or $300 for
the bulk.
The Call Is prepared to chow that
new work, including the whole of the I
concrete bed, can be done at a profit j
for 15 cents a square foot. The Call has
expert figures to show that the Super
visors proposed to allow for the
work $1200 more than it Is
worth according to the ruling
figures for laying down concrete and
bituminous pavement. The Superin
tendent of Streets and the expert of
the Street Committee must have known
that the bid of Flinn & Treacy was ex
cessive and that Dowling's original bid
was about the riÂ°ht figure.
The Call is convinced that there is a
Bteal somewhere in this particular job.
The conclusion is borne out by actual
measurements of the street and a most !
careful examination of the existing con- !
crete bed. The concrete is in excellent
form and needs but very little repair-

It is suspected that other bidders had
knowledge in advance that Dowling
would bid low, so as to stand off any
one outside of the combine who might
try to get in. When the bids were
opened it was found that Dowling was
the only low bidder, hence the simple
task of disposing of Dowling wa^ all
that remained to be done in order to
give the work to the combine at an ex

consulted at this stage of the proceed

called for to ,>set the calculations.
ACCUSED OF LYING.
Serious Charge Made Against Law
yer Alexander Campbell Jr. by
Curveson's Bondsmen.
A. W. Robinson and W. A. Dawes,
bondsmen for James Curveson to the
amount of $2500, filed their answer yes
terday to the suit brought against them
in the United States District Court by the
United States Attorney on behalf of the
Government to recover upon the bonds.
Curveson was indicted by the United
States Grand Jury for passing counter
feit money in Humboldt County and has
disappeared, leaving his bondsmen in that
unpleasant condition known as the
lurch."
The answer, drawn up by Attorney A.
P. Sweeney, makes grave charges against
Alexander Campbell Jr., attorney for
Curveson.
Mr. Campbell is accused In the answer
of having told of that which is not and
which never was, and gravely charges
in effect that he induced the bondsmen by
false representations to go on Curveson 9
bonds. . .
The following !s the language of the ac
cusing part of the answer: Said defend
ants aver that they did execute a bond
similar to the one set out in said com
plaint, and that prior to, and at the time
of the execution thereof they were in
formed by one A. Campbell, attorney for
said James Curveson, that said James
Curveson was a resident of Humboldt,
Cal and a man of large means who
would hold himself in perfect readiness
to comply with the orders of this court.
That whereas, in truth and in fact, said
James Curveson is not a man of large or
any means, and has no property of any
SUGGESTION FOR AN ART=GLASS WINDOW IN TBE GRAND (K)NAVE OF THE FERRY DEPOT.
kind or character in Humboldt County or
elsewhere in this State. That but for
the statement that said James Curveson
was a man of large means and would
hold himself in readiness to comply with
the orders of this court said defendants
would not have signed or executed said
bond in behalf of said James Curveson.
Then comes the most serious part of
the accusation of dishonesty against At
torney Campbell. It is as follows:
That said A. Campbell, attorney for
said James Curveson, well knew .said
statements were false and untrue at the
time he made the same, and made them
for the sole and only purpose of enticing
said defenndants to sign said bond. That
said defendants believed said statements,
and relying upon the same signed said
bond, otherwise they would not have
done so.
Deputy United States Attorney Schles
inger moved u> strike out that portion of
the answer quoted in the foregoing, on
the ground that even were the allegations
true it would not constitute any part of a
defense. The motion will be acted upon
next Monday by Judge de Haven.
BUSINESS MEN KEEP LENT.
Services Are Held Daily in the
Rooms of the Chamber of
Commerce.
A series of Lenten exercises was inaug
urated under the direction of the Brother
hood of St. Andrew in the rooms of tf .â¢
Chamber of Commerce yesterday ami
will be continued until next Sunday morn
ing. They are being devoted entirely to
the instruction of business men, and are
held daily between the hours of 12 and
12:30 o'clock, being called "thirty-minute
Lenten services for business men." The
noon hour was selected so as to give all
an opportunity of attending the exercises
without interference to business affairs.
h The hymn "Jesus Call Us." which opens
the service, and an address constitute the
religious programme. "A Man's Respon
sibility in Business Life" was the text of
the sermon yesterday, and was delivered
by Bishop Leonard of the diocese u'i
Utah, Nevada and Western Colorado.
"During the time of Lent," he claimed,
we should practice a spirit of self-denial
and should attempt to bring our souls
nearer to God b- attempting to learn
more about his doctrines and by keeping
the commandments."
The large attendance that characterized
the services last year was not diminished
yesterday, and, if anything, was aug
mented, as there were few seats to be had
anfl less standing room to be secured.
The title of the address to be delivered
to-day by the Rev. E. J. Lion is "A Man's
Responsibility in Domestic Life."
An Opium Victim's Death.
A. C. Morpan, a man about 40 years old,
was found by Policeman Gaynor shortly
before 3 o'clock yesterday morning in an
unconscious condition, and was taken to
the Receiving Hospital, where he died
shortly afterward. The deceased had evi
dently been a victim of the morphine
habit and death resulted from natvra. 1
causes. The body is at the Morgue.
THE SA^T FRAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, 31 ARCH 29, 1898.
WORK THAT
WILL STAND
CRITICISM
Expert's Report on
the Ferry Depot
Foundation.
A Condition Not Due to
the Acts of Commis
sioner Coinon.
Engineer Holmes Credited With
This Apparent Exception to
the List of Frauds.
PILING HAS NOT SETTLED.
...
Result of a Thorough Examination
Made at the Request of
The Call.
From time to time during the past
month The Call has received sugges
tions from more or less responsible per
sons concerning alleged frauds and de-
fects In connection with the construc
tion of the new union depot and ferry
house at the foot of Market street. Be
lieving that the people of the city and
State were entitled to a full knowledge
of the facts as they exist, these sugges
tions were taken up in their proper
order and placed in the hands of com
petent experts who were instructed to
inquire into the matter and report their
findings without prejudice.
With the substance of the reports so
far made the readers of this paper are
already familiar. They show, in brief,
that the construction of the building
from cap to corner stone has been
marked by the grossest frauds and that
the State has, by and with the consent
of the members of the Board of Har
bor Commissioners and their supervis
ing architect, Edward R. Swain, been
robbed of sums aggregating more than
$100,000. They show, moreover, that
while the immense appropriation has
already been exhausted the building is
still far from being completed and that,
as it stands, it is, inside and out, a
mass of inferior materials thrown to
gether in a crude and slipshod manner.
These things have been set forth in de
tail in these columns and will, no doubt,
be taken up at the proper moment by
the gentlemen who compose the pres
ent Grand Jury and whose duty it is to
inquire into the acts of public officials
whose greed of personal gain is greater
than their desire to serve the public.
In the midst of this mass of fraud
and official corruption it is a pleasure
to learn that there appears to be at
least one item of construction for which
the State's coffers have been emptied
which has not been made the subject
of the greed that has made the partly
finished structure a sham and a pre
tense. This is the foundation upon
which the building rests. Recently it
was asserted that the foundation had
been poorly constructed and that it had
sunk several inches on the bay side.
To ascertain the truth or falsity of this
assertion The Call secured the services
of a competent civil engineer and in
structed him to proceed with whatever
measures were necessary to determine
the facts of the matter. As has already
been intimated his report shows that
the assertions concerning the alleged
instability of the foundation are without
truth. The report is presented here
with in the same spirit of fairness that
has marked eve/y step in the work of
Investigating the condition of the build
in*.
That the foundation appears to be
sufficiently stable to pass a critical ex
amination is a matter for congratula
tion. If any credit is due it should ba
given to Chief Engineer Holmes, un.
der whose personal supervision and di
rection the work was done. It may
also be stated in passing that Commis
sioner Colnori opposed Mr. Holmes la
every possible way except by actually
vetoing his orders, and it is in no man
ner to the credit of Mr. Coinon that
the finished and tested work has proved
to be acceptable. The report follows:
-To W. S. Leake, Manager San Francis
co Callâ Dear Sir: I beg to submit here
with report on the Investigation made by
me of the foundation of the new Union
Depot and Ferry House.
All available plans and data were care
fully examined and studied. They show
the designs for the foundation to be com
prehensive and in accordance with the
best current practice. Whether they were
faithfully carried out under water and
places now closed to observation I am
unable to say.
Lines of levels were taken both longitu
dinally of the structure and transverse.
They failed to show any signs of sinking.
The masonry of the superstructure was
subjected to the most critical examina
tion, and deductions from this source
verify what was shown by the levels.
The sea wall upon which the front ar
cade of the building rests is frdm a frac
tion of an inch to an inch lower than the
outer line of the piers. This fact, per se,
is not conclusive evidence that a general
settlement has occurred.
It has been suggested that the piling of
the outer piers was not cut below mud
line. Comparing results of soundings
with plans, it Is shown that the piling is
protected with from two to six feet of
harbor mud. To any suspicion
which might be entertained as to what
faithfulness was observed In carrying out
plans and specifications a diver must be
employed to make a submarine examina
tion. Respectfully submitted,
J. H. WOLF. Engineer.

BIGGY RESIGNS
AS SUPERVISOR
Prompt Action Heads Off All
Complications That May
Arise.
Also Gives Up Hia Position in thÂ©
Democratic County Com
mittee.
William J. Blggy, recently appointed
Registrar of Voters for San Francisco
County by Governor Budd, has passed ln
two resignations to the proper authorities
since he was notiiied of his elevation to
office, in order to head off any possible
complications.
A question was raised as to whether his
claims to holding the office of Supervisor,
now pending before the Supreme Court,
would not render him ineligible to offici
ate as Registrar.
To obviate any such chance Mr. Biggy
wrote his resignation to Governor Budd
and Mayor Phelan, by both of whom he
had been appointed, and received permis
sion to withdraw from the fight for Su
pervisor.
Mr. Biggy's next move was to get him
self out of political complications. With
this end in view he handed Colonel Sulli
van, Mayor Phelan's secretary, his resig
nation as vice-chairman of the Demo
cratic County Committee, who in turn
handed it to the chairman with the un
derstanding that it should be immediately
accepted.
Mr. Biggy was Introduced to the mem
bers of the Election Commission, after
having filed his bond with the Auditor,
and took possessslon of his new office. He
stated that there would be no changes in
the office at present, though it might be
possible that some new appointments
would be made later on. There is con
siderable speculation in the City Hall re
garding who will be the next Chief Dep
uty in the office.

REGAN STIRRED
MATTERS UP

lern Out of Races.
Walter Jennlng's Sombre Again
Turns Up a Stake
Winner.
Ostler JoÂ« Won In a Gallop â Tod
Sloan First on ThroÂ©
Choices.
Sim Regan, the owner of Lone Princess
and two or three other equally poor bread
winners, formerly a jockey of some note.
Is picking up a stable prior to crossing
the hills. He got himself a couple of very
fair ones through the claiming clause yes
terday In Hermoso and Hohenzollern, and
unless his bank roll gives out he Is likely
to claim the earth. In the second event
Regan started Lone Princess, and her
showing of speed fully Justifled the high
price of hay. The high turn of speed ex
hibited by Hermoso caught Mr. Regan's
fancy, so ho filed a claim for the fast Sir
Modred colt, entered to be sold for $SOO.
J. A. Grey felt sorry to lose him, but with
first money, $275 added, it looks a good
price.
In the mile and a sixteenth selling affair
Regan sent Outgo, a 300 to 1 chance, to
the barrier. Elmwood stock farm had
Hohenzollern, which ran fourth, in for
$600, and the claiming clause sent the
Brutus colt over to Regan's barn. The
latter is a very useful horse, and no doubt
will hit the wire first on several occasions
in the future.
These two happenings were about the
only incidents varying from the usual mo
notonous routine. Outsiders grabbed the
first three purses, and then three favor
ites cakewalked in, making a stand-off.
Sombre, the daughter of Midlothian and
Miss Woodford, is considered undersized,
but she has a fascinating way of captur
ing stakes that is catching the fancy of
the talent. The books laid 5 to 1 against
her annexing the Olympic stake for two
year-olds, at four and a half furlongs,
but she packed Lonnie Clayton and US
pounds and won rather easily from Sev
ens in :54%, after getting away from the
post seventh. Frank Ireland and Milt
Young, the Corrigan duo, had first call In
the ring, and the former just did manage
to get the small end In a drive.
"Skeets" Martin found no difficulty in
taking the first race with La Mascota, the
second choice, beating the favorite,
Lucky Star, to the wire by a head.
Walter Jennings thought his mare Miss
Lynah more than good enough to beat
her company in the second event, at six
furlongs, but she was stood on her head
early in the game and failed to show, af
ter closing a 3 to 2 favorite. Valencienne.
at odds of 20 to 1. whistled through the
stretch, winning eased up in 1:13%. Good
Friend, another despised one, was second.

The mile and a sixteenth was replete
with incidents. At the first turn Gotobed
was nearly thrown. Turning into the back
stretch Cromwell was pulled up bleeding.
As the bend for the wire was reached
Duke of York fell, giving McNichols a
nasty fall. Hennessy on Hohenzollern
was twisted about by a bump, and then
after being nearly left at the post. Sloan
got up with the favorite Satyr, winning
in a drive from Marplot.
In the last event, Linstock outclassed
his field, winning easily from San Venado
and covering the mile in 1:41%.
TRACK ITEMS.
Ed Tiptoe manager of the Montana circuit,
was s> visitor at the track yesterday. Mr. Tip
ton was kept busy telling of the tempting In
ducements his State held out to horsemen.
The g-ame appears to hold out better than
ever this season. Twenty bookmakers cut In
yesterday. Joe Roee was aguln on the block,
but took time to play Valenclenne on the out
side, beating the race to the extent of $2000.
It looks very much as though Cromwell will
have to be shelved. He bled In a race run last
Friday, and was again pulled up yesterday.
Lucky Star was plainly best In the first race,
but McDonald Is a very weak finisher at times,
and allowed "Skeets" Martin on La Mascota
to smother him.
There was a good Intelligent play on Mount
Roy to win the opening scramble, tha down
town barber shops even having the tip. Ous
Wilson, though, was more than the old gelding
could stand for, and he stood at the post await
ing the result by telephone. If Wilson would
only ride up to his work he would be quite a
rider.
The owners of Valenclenne ought to send a
painting on to the Paris salon, for their Im
maculate gall would entitle them to al
most any old sort of a thing. Throw the filly's
last two races out and she looked to have a
royal chance. What her aliments were in those
two events was not given out from the stand.
Yet there were "suckers" In plenty who backed
her yesterday.
Linstock now bobs up as a most likely can
didate for the Derby, to be decided on Saturday
next. After winning yesterday's mile run he
was worked on an additional quarter, and ac
cording to one well known trainer's watch
covered the distance in 2:OS flat.
Bowling Is quite a prominent pastime to turf
habitues, and on Saturday night, April 7, there
will be a big match game bowled at a down
town resort between the Ingleside and Echo
Clubs. The members of the former comprise
the following well known horsemen: George
Rose, W. Vreeland, W. Henderson, Horace Eg
bart. Jtm Norvell and Marc Davis. The en
semble of the Echoes is a strong one, and they
agree to put the track folks out of business.
They are: Messrs. Lux, Blondln, Harris,
Belan, Hllbert and Ehrenpfort. "Strike" Nor
vell is considered a "phenom," and Is one of
the mainstays of the Inglesldes.

MTle. Held sang her little songs last
night, danced and capered, smiled and
kissed, flirted her wee skirt, swooned
and revived her large humid eyes,
wriggled and Joked her pectoral em
bonpoint with amazing facility and
made a gratuitous little speech. In
which she linked in her love the dears
Paree and San Francisco and hoped to
be with us a long, long time. But the
town â and quite a good deal of It was
there â did not singe and flame. It was
amiable enough, and, to a slight ex
tent, helped out the Illusion of each
new song being an encore. But it did
not smoke and melt and sizzle. Mile.
Held's visit need not increase the In
surance rates on the Baldwin Theater.
The accomplishments of Mile. Held
are almost entirely physical. She has
the little roly-poly figure in Its roundest
perfection and her face Is brightly beauti
ful after the conventional French mode,
and â would be perfect of its type, too, but
for a too emphatic nose. And of course
she Is chic â that Is part of her conven
tionality and nationality, for this Polish
blood of this Paris-bred vaudeville singer
makes no outward manifestations. But
her art 1b mediocre. By this I make no
reference to her voice, which is neither
more nor less than the jolly chirp you
would expect; but her manner of doing
the songs is too obviousâ you feel
all the while the one effect she Is
striving for, and which is palpably to
m.iko herself physically, lasciviously
pleasing. Naturally she sings French
sonffa with cleverer Insinuation than the
English and American women give to
them, and her "Play wiz me" is quite an
experience for even a hardened music
hall fancier. But Mile. Held does noth
ing bo cleverly that you can forget that
her talents are all centered below the
brow.
"A Gay Deceiver," the farce by Paul
Wilstach and Joseph Grismer, which in
troduces Anna Held at the close of its
third act, is one calculated to prepare you
for the limit of riskiness. In a way it is
quite the limit itself, and so literal that
misinterpretation would be impossible.
First I would rather say that it is clever,
the construction quite good to sustain the
suspense in so slim a fabric and some of
the lines adroitly witty for all their
cheap slang. But the whole scheme is
rankly vulgar; it reeks of the tenderloin.
The story deals in a Boston man with il
licit love affairs and his wife, with the
same. He leaves home, returns suddenly
and pretends he is his own twin brother,
while a senile gentleman of sinful ambi
tion openly fondles the wife. The acting
of the farce is heavy and characterless,
with the one exception of M. A. Ken
nedy, who Is scandalously real as the
aged rake.
Mr. Fernald's "The Cat and the Cher
ub," which finished the evening at a late
hour, seems superfluous to me, after see
ing Powers' "First Born." It has a cer
tain literary quality that Powers' China
town piece lacked in places, but it is prac
tically the same play without as intense
an atmosphere and with more of the usual
melodrama in the working out of the plot.
The ending, where the victim is strangled
with his own queue and propped up in a
sitting posture so as to deceive the pass-
Ing policeman, could be made even more
dramatic than that of "The First Born,"
but It is marred by the delay in reaching
ft. Half the audience saw it over their
shoulders as they left the theater. In
point of actual time "The Cat and the
Cherub" is much shorter than "The First
Born," but it seemed hours longer last
night. The acting is something less than
we are used to In Chinatown drama.
ASHTON STEVENS.
Alcazar.
Frederick Paulding makes a pood gal
vanized mummy. There is no doubt about
that. His rendition of the title role in
"The Mummy." which is on the boards
at the Alcazar this week indicates that
he is discovered. With the assistance of
the kindergarten element of the stock
company the play was carried to a finish
without an outbreak. The audience was
tolerant of infant prodigies. Miss Gert
rude Foster and Mrs. Bates worked hard
and largely redeemed the performance.

FLOWERS AND CHEERS.
The Audience at the Columbia Went
Wild in Their Testimonials
of Admiration.
If "The Naval Cadet" had opened In an
Eastern city, the audience, as It filed out,
would have said it was a melodrama of
the good old-fashioned sort, with plenty
of love, heroism, blood and villainy
thrown around the conventional orphan
with a heritage who loves the hero but
who a designing villain determines shall
marry his son and thus relieve hlm^from
the pecuniary embarrassment he has been
foolish enough to get into. True, a French
adventuress with a husband In a lunatic
asylum who links her fortune with a ras-Â«
cally fellow countryman in his endeavor
to defraud the hero out of the fruits of
his inventive genius, coupled with a few
incidental crimes and hints of dark pasts,
together with the quick transition from a
scene of quiet domesticity on Long Island
to murder in a Parisian cellar, might
somewhat complicate matters and con
fuse the casual spectator, but still the
verdict on the whole would have been
that the play was full of life and action,
that the situations were well arranged,
the climaxes, of which there were about a
dozen, well worked up, and that James J.
Corbett was more than a fairly good ac
tor, notwithstanding the fun that has
been poked at him during his career on
the stage.
This is what an Eastern audience would
have saidâ not what the audience that
packed the Columbia to the doors last
night did say. They were there not to
sco the play but to welcome "Jim" to his
home, and when he came on the stage
orchestra and dress circle clapped until
Its palms tingled, while the galleries rose
up and fairly howled. It was lully ten
minutes before quiet enough was restored
to allow Corbett to go ahead with his
lines, which, notwithstanding the severe
cold with which he is suffering, he ren
dered remarkably well, fully earning
the comment of the Hayes Valley contin
gent, who were unanimous In declaring
that "Jim done fine."
Corbett is supported by a fairly good
company, among whom lr. Lillian Lam
son, a San Francisco girl, who, in the
character of Hortense Reynolds, a French
adventuress, does some clever work,
which, however, she could Improve by a
little less force and a little more accent.
Millie James, the daughter of Louis
James, who does the ingenue, is about the
cutest little thing that has happened
since Gladys Wallace was here, and won
her way into favor at once.
The third act was the one which was
most eagerly watched for, as it is then
that "Jim" spars three rounds with Mc-
Vey and every man in the house was
watching to see if he has lost any of his
old-time speed and cleverness. That he is
as agile as ever was apparent before he
had been a minute at it, and when the
wind-up came it took three ushers and a
couple of boys to haul all the flowers over
the footlights, while the audience went
wild and would not be satisfied until Cor
bett delivered a speech, in which he apolo
gized for his cold and assured his ad
mirers that the one thing in this world he
lived for was to again meet Fitzslmmons
and win back the laurels he had lost at
Carson. . ,
When seen In his dressing-room between
the acts of the performance Corbett
looked, barring a slight cold, the very
picture of health, and, as he stood strip
ped waiting to don his ring costume for
his go with big McVey, it was evident
that it would need but little training to
make him fit to battle for a kingdom. He
seems to have taken care of himself for
the past year, with the result that the
vim so noticeably lacking just before his
departure for Nevada, has returned, and
he is once again the happy-go-lucky sky
larking Jim of Olympic Club aays, full of
a nervous energy that will not allow him
to remain quiet for a minute.
"I would give my entire receipts for the,
week if I did not have this cold," he said,
as he laughingly shook hands and asked
after the boys. "I have brought out a
good company and I want every one to
see what I can do. But this hoarseness
makes it impossible for me to appear at
my best, and I am afraid I will be a dis
appointment.
"Who do I think Is the coming: man?
Jeffries, by all odds. He is young and
clever, and as strong as a bull, and in my
opinion able to give a good account of
himself with the best of them. As to Mc-
Coy, he is a good man, but I don't see on
what he bases his claims to championship
honors. He never fought a heavy-weight
in his life that I ever heard of, so I don't
see how he can consider himself in the
topnotcher class. A go between him and
Choynski would be a hot one and worth
going miles to see. I am -sorry to hear of
poor Joe's illness. He is a good fellow,
and I am going to see him. I would like
to have him as a sparring partner if I go
on the road and he would take the place.
Sharkey is a hard game, but he has the
reputation of never fighting on the square.
He is strong and can stand any amount of
punishment, and if he would only let the
referee decide one of his contests instead
of the police he would be much better off
and have much more reason to consider
himself in line for the championship in
the future.
"Well, you fellows will have to excuse
me. I must go on now, but don't leave
until you have seen my rough and tumble
with McVey in the last act; it is the hot
test thing on the stage."
The visitors stayed, saw and agreed it
was about as near the real thing as could
be put up.
Corbett's family occupied the two staee
boxes on one side, and the old peonle
must have felt proud of their son for
in spite of the fact that the diary scene
between Corbett and Miss James which
is one of his best, had to be cut owins to
Jim's cold, he acquitted himself nobly and
helped to make the entire performance
what It is, a well presented and entertain
ing play.
Orpheum.
Of the five out of the six new Orpheum
turns seen by the writer at the opening
performance four are signal successes
and the other one not at all bad in its
kind. It is of a rather poor kind, how
ever, this "Dramatic Apent" sketch pre
sented by Harry Watson and Alice
Hutchings, with the trampy assistance
of Ed Edwards, and culminates in tne
worm-eaten business of attempting to
carve a rubber fowl. But the other four
are unique and clever, and they put the
show on something like its old level of
excellence. Montgomery and Stone do
coon songs, buck and wing dances and
flash nigger repartee in a way that beats
the record here for a white team In a
colored act. The Five Arabian Whirl
winds are remarkable tumblers. Their
turn is quick, short and exciting. An odd
feature is that the heavy Arabian who
does the feats of strength is also the
llthest and most expert of the tumblers
The Glisandos clown very musically and
very entertainingly.
On the whole, the Orpheum bill this
week would seem especially calculated to
please persons who iiave not been pleased
by most of the bills of the last several
months.
Morosco's.
"Ten Nights in a Barroom" was re
vived at Morosco's last night, with Harry
Mainhall as the touching drunkard, La
Petite Lund as his daughter, and Landers
Stevens as the principal villain. The old
sermon against intemperance still finds
the sympathies of a South Side audience,
and last night the entr'acte bar business
suffered acutely through the moral of the
Play.

A Resolution Calling for Cer

Committee.
FIGHTING TO SAVE TIME.
Smith mnO. Britt Lead the Fight to
Delay Action Until the Last
Minute.
The first move toward securing com
peting bids for lighting the streets and
public buildings was made by Super
visor Dodge at the meeting of the
board, and was promptly met by Smith
and Britt, who adopted the only course
left open to the monopoly and fought
for delay. As the Smith-Britt forces
numbered seven, they succeeded in
having the matter referred to a Joint
committee consisting of the Streets and
and Street Lights committees.
The subject was brought up in the
form of the following resolution, pre
sented by Supervisor Dodge:
WHEEEAS, The Mutual Electric
Light Company proposes to furnish
the city with electric light for streets
and public buildings at a saving to
the city of at least $40,000 per an
num under the present cost, which is
about $120,000 per annum, provided
they be now given the same facilities
that are enjoyed by the present con
tractors; and whereas, said company
will give a bond if necessary for
$100,000 to guarantee such saving,
signed by such responsible citizens
as Alvinza Hayward, D. O. Mills and
P. B. Cornwall; and whereas, three
months' time is required by said
company to erect necessary poles,
etc.,
.Resolved, That *aid company be
invited to make a specific request for
the privilege of erecting poles, desig
nating their number and location,
and that the Street Lights Committee
be instructed to invite proposals in
such language that no company shall
be excluded from competing; and
that bids bo invited forthwith for
supplying artificial light for streets
and public buildings for two years
from and after August 1, 1898.
Resolved, That the Gas Inspector
be instructed to forthwith furnish
this board with a map showing the
location of every gas and electric
street lamp for which the city pays,
designating them respectively as gas
or electric.
Dodge moved the adoption of the res
olution at once. He called attention to
the fact that the Mutual Electric Light
Company had guaranteed to save the
city at least $40,000 a year under the
present cost, and spoke of the annual
deficit which necessitated cutting off
a portion of the lights each year and
leaving some parts of the city in dark
ness for weeks. He believed that pri
vate individuals could get thf> same ser
vice that the city gets at a much less
cost.
There was a rush between Smith and
Britt to get the floor first, both hav
ing the same object in viewâ opposition
to the resolution in some form, they
hardly knew what, for it had been
sprung on them so suddenly there was
no opportunity to form a plan of de
fense. Smith was recognized and, un
able to pick any flaw in the terms of
the resolution, demanded that it be
referred to committee â any committee
suited him, so that it could be held
up until some plan could be formed to
defeat it.
Britt wanted it referred to the Street
Committee. He launched forth into an
incoherent statement about giving
away a franchise that would be worth
more to the company than it agreed to
save the city and that it could well
afford to make the offer it did.
Mayor Phelan called Brill's attention
to the fact that the resolution did not
give anything away, but merely in
vited the company to make a specific
request for the privilege of erecting
poles, designating their number and lo
cation. This seemed to disconcert Brltt
for a moment and he called for another
reading of the resolution, which was
done.
Dodge opposed any delay. He said
it was a matter that should be con
sidered by the full board and at once.
Here was a company that offered to
save the city thousands of dollars if
granted the same privileges at present
enjoyed by another, and without which
the city was absolutely at the mercy
of a monopoly. It would require three
months for the opposition to place itself
in readiness to carry out the provisions
of the contract and there was no time
to be lost. The resolution was plain and
he could see no necessity for referring
it to a committee.
Britt again talked in favor of send
ing the resolution to the joint commit
tee, it would be necessary, he said, to
have the interested parties appear and
explain what they wanted and the joint
committee could then make an intel
ligent report to the board. Mr. Britt,
had he really desired a personal ex
planatioii of what was wanted, could
have called upon the representatives of
the opposition comp ny who were in
attendance at the meeting fir that very
purpose, and he ignored the i.iain fea
ture of the resolution, which provided
that the company should give that very
information. What Mr. Britt wanted
was time, but whether he wanted time
in which to hear from the company
that is charging the city 11 cents per
thousand volts for light, measured on
meters that, a BO per cent fast, while
it only charges some of its private con
sumers 5% and 6 cents, he did not make
known.
Lackmann urged that immediate ac
tion be taken in view of the shortness
of time. If there was any chance to
save the city such a sum the Super
visors were in duty bound to do so.
Smith made another fight for delay
by ignoring the terms of the resolution,
as Britt had done, and claiming that
the granting of permission to erect
poles was a valuable privilege and
should be taxed by the city. Dodge
knocked this argument out by showing
JUDGE RHODES BORDEN.
(From a Photograph by Taber.)
Appointed by Governor Budd to Succeed Judge
Crjarles W. SlacK-
Rhodes Borden, who was yesterday appointed to the superior bench by
Governor Budd to fill the place made vacant by the resignation of Judge
Charles W. Slack, is at present chief deputy in the office of City and
County Attorney Harry T. Creswell, which position he has held since 1592.
In 1596, at the earnest solicitations of the members of the local bar, he
accepted the nomination of Superior Judge, running- on both the regular
Democratic and non-partisan tickets, but failed of election.
Judge Borden is comparatively a young man. He was born in Alabama
in 1858, and is therefore but 40 years old. He received his rudimentary
education at the University of Kentucky, coming to California with his
parents, before graduating, in 1869, and located in Fresno County. He re
moved to this city in 18S1. Immediately after arrivi-ng here he took up the
study of law in the office of Judge John Garber, arid graduated from the
Hastings Law College in 1883. For a number of years he was engaged by
Garber, Boalt & Bishop, attending to much of their outside business.
The Borden family is one of the oldest in the United States. Leaving
England they arrived in Rhode Island in 1035. The branch to which the
new appointee belongs settled in Virginia in 1711, removing to Alabama in
1836, and can therefore be numbered among the oldest families of the
South.
The appointment is indeed a great compliment to the successful aspi
rant, as Frank Murasky, his chief opponent, is a very popular and equally
as well qualified man. Either of them is eminently fitted for the place.
Powerful influence must have been brought to bear to overcome the influ
ence of the friends of Murasky.
It is rumored among attorneys that upon Judge Borden taking his seat
the criminal cases heretofore assigned to Judge Dunne's department will
be assigned to Judge Borden's court.
that the passage of the resolution
would in no way affect the right to tax
the privilege, which could be done if
the city saw fit to do so. He referred
to the former attempt to stop the Mu
tual Company from erecting poles in
the city, and the city's.defeat in the Su
preme Court, and asked if the Supervi
sors cared to undertake any more such
litigation.
By this time Britt and Smith had
matters well in hand and the resolu
tion was referred to the joint commit
tee, with instructions to report at the
next meeting.
Dodge and Laekmann were the only
ones to oppose it, while 1 askins, Dela
ny, Sheehan. Morton, Britt. Smith and
Rivers voted in the affirmative.
In view of that part of the resolu
tion instructing the Street Lights Com
mittee to invite proposals in such lan
guage that no company shall be ex
cluded from biddir" It is an Interest
ing fact that Mr. Rivers, the chairman
of that committee, has in his possession
now a proposal approved by the com
mittee, which does just what it is in
tened shall not be done; namely, the
cutting off of all but the San Francisco
company from bidding, owing to the
terms imposed. If that proposal takes
the same course it has in the past, it
will be held back until about ten days
before the expiration of the present
contract and then rushed through,
thus effectually choking all opposition.
Marion Crawford on the Pope.
Marlon Crawford's style of oratory is
very much on a par with his literary
style. There Is the same fluent, easy de
livery, the same absolute perfection of
manner. It Is clean cut. polished work,
yet somehow he never rises to the higher
flights of eloquence; he never wakes his
audience to an outburst of enthusiasm.
He is a good talker, in short, rather than
a great speaker, and that is really all one
can demand of a popular lecturer of the
day.
Naturally the large audience which
filled the California Theater last night
was extremely sympathetic. The lecturer
is himself an ardent Roman Catholic, the
lecture dealt with Pope Leo XIII, and
his life in the Vatican, and was given un- p
der the auspices of the Y. M. I. Mayor
Phelan, in a speech of somewhat unnec
essary length, undertook the introductory
part of the business, as If Crawford re
quires any Introduction to an audience of
cultured, novel reading Californlans. The
lecturer, who bears himself with all the
ease of a polished gentleman of the world,

Or JOHNSON-LOCKE MERCANTILE GO* Mutual lite Building, Seattle,
commanded the attention of his audience
from the lirst. He began with a short
historical introduction, explaining the po
litical causes which led to the downfall
of the temporal power of the papacy, and
contrasting very strongly the gentle fee
bleness of Pius IX's administration with
that of his successor, Leo XIII. Under
I'ius the political power of the Vatican
sank to zero, but under the vigorous rule
of Leo it has won the respect of all na
tions.
Marion Crawford regards the Pope as
among the greatest .statesmen of the
century, and in one of the most forcible
passages of his lecture compared him
with Lincoln and Gladstone, bracketing
the three great statesmen together. All
throe, he pointed out, were men who pos
sessed remarkable physical qualifications
in their youth. All three could bo elo
quent on occasion, and all three had a
certain element of melancholy sadness in
their composition.
Leo is now nearly 90 years of age, yet
Crawford drew a wonderful picture of
his pnysical vigor. With almost a super
fluity of detail he told of the hours the
Pope keeps, of the scanty meals he eats;
all the little peculiarities of his character
were set orth with photographic accur
acy. The Pope has great conversational
power. Rarely does a distinguished per
sonage pass through Rome without being
summoned to an audience. *j. his dicta
torial way, Leo will sometimes taiK for a
couple of hours, and the visitor feels
through it all that he is listening to a
man of real power, who unites the
three great essentials of strength â those
of head, heart and hand. The Pope, as
Mr. Crawford sums him up, is evenly bal
anced as a statesman, a scholar and a
man. No such personage has appeared
at the head of the church fo>- centuries.
He has turned tiie feeling of the nations
of Europe from hostility to friendliness.
He has achievou greater results than
Mazzini and Garibaldi, Bismarck or
Napoleon 111. Act, despite all this ex
treme praise, Mr. Crawford had to admit
that Leo is practically a prisoner in his
own Vatican. Political reasons are often,
given for his voluntary seclusion; but the
real cause is the disturbed condition of
Rome. A volcano of anarchical senti
ment rages beneath the surface, and the
Pope's life, should he venture beyond his
own grounds, would not be safe for a
day. Some fanatical revolutionist, af
flicted with the "sour indigestion of free
thought," would cut his career short, and,
therefore, the rulers of modern Italy, who
have the highest respect for Loo's char
acter and ability, are glad to have him
remain at home. The lecture to-night
will describe the "Original Mr. Isaacs'
Early Newspaper Experience in India."

the construction of such railway, and
continuously thereafter, in each and ev
ery month until the completion thereof,

The failure to comply with any of i
said conditions shall work an immedi- !
ate forfeiture of such franchise and the
road or track constructed thereunder. I

or from any of said conditions. On or

ther condition that the Board shall at i
all times have the right to regulate the

inexpedient by the Board to use any of i
the property reverting to it by reason |
of such expiration in the operation of ;
a street railroad, then the Board shall j
have power to lease such property to
any person, company or corporation af- !
ter the notice, on the terms, and in the j
manner above provided as to the grant- i
ing of street railroad franchises, as far
as the same may be applicable. But no j

ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It la hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that itÃ public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION L Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until tha object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam", water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as tha
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the salo
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting tha
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, aa
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such step 3or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission,
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
i of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. ThÂ©
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors a
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but In
case the votes cast In favor of both
shall or-
1718
propositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected. .<-.
Nothing In this section shall be bo
construed 'as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same "
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same in the manner herein
after provided. c the cost of any -public
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the city
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there

ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
â the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
upon such terms.
In case, however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded Indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon, and whether such bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At
least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed -without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to bepaid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
newspaper.
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting of
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
mination as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four

have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall* call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. No question other
than the acquisition of such utility arid
the incurring of the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec. 8. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the proposed public
â utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City

rally will be held. Dr. Chapman will de
liver the address of the morning, and
others beside the clergy will be present.
The paper read before the Methodist

president; Rev. J. Stephens, vice-presi
dent; \V. M. Woodward, secretary; H W.
Peck. W. S. Urmy and A. H. W eedham,

OUR SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.
The exports of domestic merchandise from
the United States to Africa during the year
ending June 30. ISSS. -were valued at $3,090,737,
while In the year ending with the same month,
1897, the total ran up to J16.923.545. The busi
ness with South Africa has steadily increased
for ten years. The recent Increase is attrib
utable principally to the fact that that coun
try has bought largely of our cereals during
the two years that Australia has r">?n unable
to supply her.

the pressure is high In the Interior and low

but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 28.â The familiar spec
tacle was presented on the Stock Exchange to
day of a violent reaction upon the culmination
of an event which has long been anticipated
and discounted. The facts were that the find
ings of the Maine Court of Inquiry were pre
sented to Congress and were proved to be ex
actly as foreshadowed. That is ;to say, the
Maine is found to have been blown up by a
submarine mine. Ever since the morning after
the explosion the stock market has been de
pressed by the constant dread that this report
would be formulated by constituted officials of
the United States. The speculative public as
sumed that such an allegation would necessi
tate a rupture between the United States and
Spain and consequent damage to values of all
securities, which It was attempted to measure
by a constant decline in prices since the date
of the explosion almost to the present time.
Yet the actual publication to-day of the report
resulted in a rebound in prices, which at the
high point of the day had wiped out a large
proportion of the losses which have occurred
since the explosion In Havana harbor. This
was brought about through the movement of
the bear traders to take their profits. Having
been Industriously selling stocks for weeks in
anticipation of the harm to values to be done
by the .Maine report, they were warned by the
Imminence of the actual publication that the
owest prices to be looked for on that account
had been reached, and they therefore set about
to buy stocks to till their contracts. The
w-oEress of the . settlement quietly developed j
the fact that the short interest was large and
unwieldy beyond all expectation. Besides this,
they nad to meet the skillful^ and- -well[organ
ized efforts of a powerful bull combination
which had quietly possessed itself of as much
ns possible of .the floating supply of stocks in
thÂ» market at the low level. The liquidation
of the "alt few weeks had left the supply of
stacks very small. When the shorts began to
bid" they found bull operators in full competi
tion with. them, bidding up prices. The result
was a scramble by the ; shorts, when reached
the proportions of a bear panic during the day
and sent prices skyward. The bulls resorted
fo all the usual devices to assist their cam
nlien for squeezing the shorts. The "news"
that was circulated In Wall street during the
day was much of It as frantic on the side of
peaceful probabilities as was that on the side
Â£r war used by bears In their recent operations
for a decline The apprehensions of the bears
'"" fed by a printed report from Washington
that * Spam had completely acceded to all Presi
dent McKinley's requests. Including an armls
,," between Cubans and Spaniards for six
month* The passage of the Spanish elections,
with their assurance of legislative support to
Premier Sagasta and the conservative course
niirfMjed by Congress toward the Maine report
eaveswne assurance that President McKlnley's
well known desire for a peaceful adjustment
with Spain might find a successful outcome.
This pave color to the reports which wore
placed in circulation And magnified the fears !
at the hard pressed bear*. Without this and
?vL tinder-lying strength of financial and bust

'; CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
1 CHICAGO, March 28.â The question of peace
; or war overshadowed all else on 'change to-day.
Assumptions of a possible solution of the Cu
' ban question resulted In sharp recoveries from
; early declines and with the exception of oats
â  everything closed strong and higher. Wheat
advanced %c for July and l%c for May. Corn
closed *()(g>*2C higher; oats a shade lower and
1 provisions 2V;<& 2%c higher.
Wheat started with an appearance of flrm
1 ness that gave way almost immediately to one
' of weakness. There was a mild disposition
shown at first to cover short lines on account
â¢ of the low temperatures prevailing in the
1 Northwest. Heavy rains were reported over
' the winter wheat country and reports of other
i I damage by the cold, coupled with .unexpected
1 j strength at Liverpool, where some futures were
; I %d higher, started the market, aa far as July
. ! and the more distant futures were concerned,
1 ! at prices a shade better than Saturday's clos
: ing. Smaller receipts in the Northwest also of
i fered encouragement to the .bulls. But the
I market turned weak at once. What little de
â¢ | mand there was for the shorts had been soon
; satisfied and as no other support of conse-
q uence materialized, the decline for a few
i moments was rapid, July selling- off at 83*4@
! 83*Â»c, its opening price, to S3Hc. Some liqui
dation by the large world's wheat sh'lpmenX.
, which amounted to 8,773,000 bushels. Another
source of weakness was the large addition to
the contract stocks. Besides the 27 cars re
ceived from regular sources, 140 cars and 36,
; i 400 bushels No. 1 Northern were received from
mixing houses, a total of about 203.000 bush
1 els in all. After the decline to 82Â»4c in July
â  there was a rally to 82% c under covering by
; scalpers, but prices sagged again In a short
time to 82% c and held around that until about
' 11 o'clock. Then the market began to improve.
I The decrease in the visible supply, 1,330.000
bushels, was much greater than looked for.
But everything else was lost sight of In the
â  consideration of the news relating to the crisis
1 between the United States and -Spain. Reports
1 that Spain had accepted the suggestions of this
i Government In â  regard â¢to Cuba started
; a. buying demand that increased in volume as
the season wore on and did not cease until the
, closing bell sounded. Shorts of every descrip
tions were driven to cover and investment buy
1 Ing, which has been almost totally lacking for
I some time, was In â  evidence. . .
Half an hour from the close July had ad
' vanced to 84% c. Realizing was quite heavy at
this point and the price reacted to 83T4c. but
rebounded again shortly. The close ,- was
1 i strong at S4c bid. May was traded in very lit
! tie. ' It opened %c lower at $1 03%, but ad
; vanced- at once to $1 04, and during the activ
, ity in July sold .up as high ,as $ I 05%. It
i closed, at Isl 05%. â - â  '-
Corn was fairly active and firm with the ex
ception' of -a' short time after the opening,
! when some â¢ decline took â¢ place In sympathy
with wheat. May ranged from 29'4c t0.28%@
25%0 and. closed %@%c higher at 29*40. . ,
Oats were heavily â¢ raided during < the morn-
Ing by all classes of longs. .. Liquidation was
general and prices broke sharply. The market
reacted -when â¢ the turn came â¢In wheat and
corn, but the recovery was only to . previous
prices. â  Shipping demand was slow. May
ranged from 25*026-& Cto j 24% c and j closed a
shade lower at 2oV*Â®2s%c.^ ;-Â ... -. - â¢ :
Provisions, like everything else, were weak
during the first part of the season. At the
close May pork was 12% c higher at $9 50: May
lard 2%c higher at $4 93 and May ribs 5c higher

WHEATâ More pacific reports regarding the
Spanish crisis hardened the market at Eastern

On this coast this improved feeling was ac

COFFEEâ C. E. â¢ Blckford's circular says: â  i
"Market continues quiet, with a downward
tendency for all descriptions of .washed
Coffees, especially Guatemalan, which buyers
still continue to avoid. Costa Rlcas have been
taken in a sparing way and with even these
small Bales a further reduction has been es
tablished in quotations as given below. :-Un
washed Salvadors about hold their ground, and
the sentiment in their favor noted in our last
review has been supported in a practical â  way
by liberal engagements for forward delivery on
the basis of existing spot prices. The New
York , market .for Brazilians Is again lower
compared with last week's figures. - To-day's
stock consists of 4335 Costa Rice, 171 Nicaragua,
71"7 Salvador," 14,356 Guatemala and 906 Mexi
can; In all, 26,803 bags, as against 16.566 bags

Joaquin Eslaba Calmly
Confesses the Brutal
Crime.
Choked the Tamale Vender
Before Beating In His
Skull.
THE VICTIM A CRIPPLE.
Murderer Arrested While Trying to
Make His Escape Across
the Bay.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, March 28.
The killing of Charles Gates, the crip
pled tamale maker, by Joaquin Eslaba
was a brutal example of what a bru
tal instinct is capable of. There does
not appear to be a single suggestion
of intelligence in the crime. It was
planned coarsely, was carried out
The Tamale Parlor in the Basement Where a Brutal Young: Mexican Beat the
Crippled Proprietor to Death.
coarsely and the murderer's attempts
to hide the traces of crime were equally
Coarse.
The crime was a horrible butchery â
murder is too dignified a name for It.
Never has such evidence of an insane
desire to kill a fellow man been ex
posed in the Oakland Morgue ap is
presented by Gates. One-tenth of the
blows showered on the old man's head
by the piece of gas pipe would have
been sufficient to cause death, but Es
laba wanted blood.
As soon as Eslaba was arrested he
began to confess and he has been con
fessing all day. His official-confes
sion was made to Prosecuting Attor
ney Malvin and is as follows:
"I live at 807 Market street, San
Francisco."
"What is your occupation?"
"I was in the tamale business
there."
"Did you ever work for the man
that was munlered last night?"
"No, 1 never did. We worked to
gether in San Francisco."
"How did you come to go to the
murdered man's place of busi
ness?"
"To get a job."
"What took place after you got
there?"
"We sat talking about the tamale
business, and about S o'clock a man
and woman came. I think the
woman's name is Grace Galindo.
The man. I . .ink, works in tne
Macdonough building. We were all
drinking. About 1:15 or 1:30 o'clock
the man and woman left. Gates
and I continued talking, and I
asked him to lena me some money.
He said business was poor and
that he could not let me have any
money. He asked me why I did
not go to the next corner and sell
tamales. The:- he said, 'Why don't
you go back to your wife?' I said
I left her once and I would not go
back. He then asked me about
some money tha- I once owed him.
I said I did not think it was right
for him to send a bill for $3 50 to
my boÃs, when I only owed, hint
$1 75. My boss paid the bill."
'What did he say about your
wife?"
"He Baid she had been in the
business. He did not say what
business, but I knew that he meant
that she had been a bad woman. I
said, 'Keep yo.r mouth shut, and
hit him in the face. He called
â¢Murder!" and I thought I would
finish him, so I hit him with a club
that I found in a box that I had
been sitting on."
"Did you ga - or tie him before
hitting him with the club?"
"After 'hitting him with the club
he commenced haJlooing. so I tied
a cord around his nock and hit him
with a piece of gaspipe and finished
him."
"Had you been good friends with
the murdered man previous to last
night?"
"We always had been good
friends."
"Did you quarrel about the bill?
"Yes. a little. In July the bill was
paid. This is the lirst time we had
had any words about it."
"Why did you go to Gates' place
last night?"
"Because I had known him so
long when I worked In this city."
"Did you conclude to ...lil him
when you struck him with the
club?"
"1 thought I might as well kill
him and fmis'i him. The ilrst time I
hit him with my list; then I hit
him with i..c club."
"Did you intend to get the money
back that you had paid him?"
"No, I i. -i not. I said ihe bill
was all right, as I couldn't read,
and I did not know what it said."
"What made you hit him in the
first place? '
"He spoke abMit my wife. I said:
'If you don't keep your mouth shut
I will punch you.' When I knocked
him down he began to bleed in the
left side of the face. Then I hit
him with the pipe."
"Did you take anything from the
murdered man?"
"I only took his watch. I did not
go through the rest of his pockets.
Then I went to the money drawer
and took what money there was in
it."
Detective Holland here stated
that there was about $1 75 and a
suck of money in the drawer.
The prisoner said: "1 thought
that as the man was dead he
would not ne<?d the money, so I
took it. I did not count the money
in the sack."
"Where did you go after you had
killed the murdered man?"
"I went across the street to San
Pablo avenue. I was going to San
Francisco."
â¢â¢Would you have denied commit
ting the murder if any one had
asked you about it after you had
done it?"
"No. I would not. The bill was
for tamales that I had bought from
him seven or eight years ago. when
I sold tamales here. Before I left
the place 1 blew out all the lights
and shut the door, which had one
of those locks that locks itself.
I then went to the sink and washed
my hands, and t.en went Into ..ie
bedroom and dried my hands with
a towel I found there."
"How old are you?"
"I am 29 years old, and was born
In California,"
"Were you ever in trouble be
fore?"
"Yes. In San Diego I stole a
horse with another fellow, and got
six months in San Quentin. After
getting: out of ja*i I went to Santa
Rosa and worked on a ranch."
"Were you going to San Fran
cisco after you committed the mur
der?"
"I went to the narrow-gauge
depot."
Detective Holland said that he
recalled him to memory when he
was in <-a.kiand before, and asked
him if he had not grown stouter.
The prisoner said yes, that he was
stouter.
"Where is your wife now?"
"She is living on Market street,
in this city. When I came bac.
from Santa Rosa I found tuat my
wife had been going around in sa
loons with men."
"Where did you go after going to
the narrow-gauge depot?"
"I went to Bruadwav, from there
to Eighth, then to Eighth and
Washington and then to Seventh
street, to the Oakland House,
which is opposite the broad-gauge
depot. I slept there until 5:30 this
rr.orning; then I got on the first
train to go to the city. At the
pier. I was arrested by the officers.
I knew Kyte when I was in Oak
land before, but I did not see him
until he was too close.
Grace Galindo and John Metz, who
were arrested early this morning be
cause they had been seen late at the ta
male kitchen, were released this after
noon, as they are not in any way con
cerned in the murder.
There is no doubt that Eslaba's mo
tive was robbery and that the story
of being annoyed at the mention of his
wife's name is merely an excuse. Es
laba is an ex-convict, but since he has
been known in Oakland he appears to
have behaved himself. His arrest was
very cleverly effected, and was the re
sult of the plans of Captain Fletcher.
When the police searched the kitchen
they found a woman's hat, which was
identified as belonging to a girl named
Grace Galindo. The girl was soon
found in a lodging-house and from her
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, 3IAKCH 29, 1898.
1 It was learned that Joaquin Eslaba was
lln the kitchen when she left. It was
; concluded that he would know some
i thins about the murder, and that he
! would attemnt to get over to San Fran
i Cisco by the early trains. The de
i pots were watched and Detective Hol
land landed the prisoner, as he was
: about to board a train.
Eslaba had made great efforts to
: hide the traces of his crime. There
was much blood on his clothes and he
took a room at the Oakland House,
near the depot. He says he could not
get the blood off his shirt, so he turned
it inside out. and it was in this condi
tion when he was arrested. He says
] he slept soundly and did not wake till
: the trains began running this morn-
ing. :'"â¢â _
The murderer Is about 29 , years old
I and is not at all attractive. He dis
cusses his crime, almost' with satisfac
! tion, and says if he had not been drink
i ing he would never have killed Gates.
The Coroner ordered an autopsy this
: afternoon which showed that the tem
poral and facial arteries were severed.
The jury to-night returned the fallow
ing verdict after taking the testimony
of six persons:
We, the jury, do find that the name of
the deceased was Charles E. Gates, a na
tive of Massachusetts, aged about 43
i years, and that he came to his death at
Thirteenth and Broadway. Oakland. Ala
meda County, Cal.. at about 11:30 o'clock
p. m.. March 27, 1898. and that death was
caused by concussion of the brain, hem

ALAMEDA. March 2S.â A meeting of
1 citizens interested in the public schools
has been called for to-morrow evening at
the City Hall to hear the report of the
committee on the best means for relieving
the overcrowded condition of the nubile
schools, and especially the high school.
The committee, will recommend the hold
ing of a bond election for the issuance of
i a moderate amount of bonds, sufheient to
construct a grammar school in one of the
i crowded districts, probably the Haight,
! which will relieve the pressure on the
building at present occupied by some of
the grammar classes and the high school
i as well. It is not at ah certain that even
; a small amount of bonds will carry, as
i people are very averse to increase the
i present amount of taxation.

A MISER BOUND
AND ROBBED
Henry Hayland's Gold
Taken Before His
Eyes.
Three Men Enter His Hut at
Midnight and Carry Away
His Savings.
Ho Rejoices in the Fact That They
Only Procured a Portion of
His Coin.
OAKLAND, March 28.â Henry Hayland,
who for the past twenty years or more
has lived In a little shanty Just outside
the town limits of Oakland, was to-night
robbed of about $65 in coin and a gold
watch under peculiar circumstances.
Hayland is an old man, owning about
two hundred acres of land, and has the
reputation of being a miser. He has lived
in a little wreck of a shanty on the out
skirts of the cÂ»ty and carefully hidden
away his savings where they would be
easy of access in case of need, or for the
common purpose of the miserâ to gloat
over them in the stilly hours of the night.
At about midnight" to-night three men
entered the lonely cabin on the hillside,
bound its sole occupant, and, at the point
of the pistol, compelled him to tell where !
his treasure of a lifetime was buried. |
Before his very eyes they took It, and
left him bound alone and gloating over
the fact that he never revealed the
whereabouts of his largest store.
Later in the night a casual passer-by
was startled by the groans and cries of
the miserable man, and paused long
enough to make an investigation. En
tering the wretched hovel, he found its
occupant bewailing the gold he had lost
and struggling frantically to break forth
from his bonds. Hayland was at once re
leased and told his story, wailing over
what he had lost and rejoicing because
he had deceived the robbers In not noti
fying thorn where the balance of his
money lay safely hidden.
The police were at once notified, and
although Hayland has no idea who the
robbers were. Sergeant Morrison has
hopes of capturing them from his descrip
tion. _______________

Benjamin Smith, who worked as clerk
for Pension Agent P. F. Walsh, came to
his death yesterday morning by inhaling
the fumes of illuminating gas at his resi
dence, 207 Fillmore street.
His wife occupied another room with
Mrs. Haines of 1309 Steiner street, and
was awakened shortly after 2 o'clock in
the morning by the odor of escaping gas.
She traced the odor to her husband's
room and found him lying *n bed uncon
scious. She and Mrs. Haines at once
dragged him Into the parlor and threw
open the windows so that the uncon
scious man might get fresh air. But the
deadly gas had taken too firm a hold on
him, and he died before assistance could
be summoned.
An examination of the gas fixtures in
Smith's room by Deputy Coroner Tyrrel
indicated that the deceased met his death
accidentally. Smith had been reading
in bed by the aid of a gas lamp on a
small table near the head of the bed and
within reach of his hand. Gas was sup
plied to the lamp by a rubber hose con
necting the lamp with the gas fixtures.
Before going to sleep he had turned off
the gas at the lamp, but there being a
leak In the hose between the gas fixtures
and the lamp, the gas escaped and killed
him.
The body was taken to the Morgue. The
deceased was a native of England, 40
years old. Ho had beeen in a sickly con
dition for somr> time previous.

PREPARATIONS
FOR TROUBLE
Extended so Far as to
Lay Hold of the
Camanche.
Talk of Fitting Up the Old Mon
itor With Her Antique
Smooth- Bores.
Now There Is More Talk of Peace
Than War at Mare Island, but
Work Goes Steadily On.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO. March 28.â Preparations
for trouble have extended so far as to
lay a hold on the old monitor Caman
che. She was towed to the quay wall
this morning, and five tons of coal were
put in her bunkers. To-morrow the
fires will be started under her boilers
and they will be thoroughly tested. She
was for two years the trainir.j ship of
the naval reserves of San Francisco,
and before that had long lain in the
stream off the island, so it is hard to
say just what repairs are needed. Cap
tain Glass, commandant of the yard,
will have ascertained just what is
needed to put the old craft into fighting
order and may have a chance to bring
her old smooth-bores into action. They
are good guns yet, says Captain Glass.
A 15-inch shot when propelled by a full
charge of fif* pounds of powder has a
smashing effect which is very great.
Such a shot has very little penetrating
power, but it will deal a crushing blow
of tremendous force. To put modern
guns on the old Camanche would re
quire a practical remodeling of the
mechanism of the boat, so she will be
brought out, iZ she should be needed,
with her prehistoric smooth-bores.
Vhe construction department is on
the lookout for black paint and lamp
black. The department has orders to
purchase all of this to be found here on
the Pacific Coast.
There was a well-dpfined rumor about
Vallejo to-day which stated that dis
charges were being refused to men who
had served out their time. This is em
phatically denied. It is one of the
strictest rules of the navy ttiat when a
man's time expires he must be allowed
to go. There was a sudden change of
sentiment at the Island to-day and
from a firm conviction that war was
certain there were many prophecies
that there would be no hostilities. This
was before the dispatches announcing 1
the attitude of the President had been
received, and it was generally believed
that the commandant had been notified
of the intended course of the Govern
ment.
QUARANTINE DIFFICULTY
HAS BEEN ADJUSTED.
Cattle May Now Be Moved From.
Point to Point Within the State
Limits.
SACRAMENTO. March 2S.â The United
States quarantine difficulties have now
been satisfactorily adjusted by the Sec
retary of Agriculture, upon application of
Governor Budd and the Secretary of the
State Board of Health. The line across
the central part of the State has been
abandoned, and cattle nay now be moved
from point to point within the State
without inspection. This will permit the
cattle in the southern part of the 9tate
to be moved north, where feed can be
had, which will greatly relieve the stock
men of that section.
While the sou.iern cattle-owners are
thus benefited, the stock-breeders north
of the abandoned line and in the pre
viously exempted portion of the State
â will not be injured, as their herds will be
permitted by the faecretary of Agriculture
(upon application" to t>e moved across ihe
State line into adjoining States. Owners
of cattle in the southern portion of me
State and southern transportation com
panies which send or ship them north
should report their destination to the
secretary of the State Board of health
at Sacramento.
Pioneer Charles Lewis Dead.
SALINAS, March 2S.â Charles Lewis,
one of the oldest and best-known of this
valley's pioneers, died near Prunedale Â»ast
evening of paralysis. He was born in
Switzerland sixty-nine years ago, and
came to California in 1854. After wander
ing all over the State, he settled in San
JosÂ© in 1864, coming to Salinas Valley in
I&U9. After opening the first restaurant
here he bought land in Prunedale.

SALINAS, March 28. â The Spreckels
Sugar Company . 3terday closed a con
tract with G. R. Field, superintendent of
construction at the sugar factory, on oe

pleted in ninety days.
11l Luck of a Convict.
PORTLAND, Or., March 28.â A convict
escaped from the State penitentiary to

through twenty-four feet of brick, but
when the time to escape came the larger
man could not force his body through the
hole and could not get away.

IN MEMORY OF BURKE.
Out of respect to the memory of Lieu
tenant Burke, the Police Commissioners
adjourned their weekly meeting at an
early hour last evening. President Tobin
was unable to attend, owing- to illness,
and Commissioner Alvord occupied the
chair. After the minutes ha<i been read
Secretary Wright was instructed to
spread the name of the brave officer on
his minutes and to draw up resolutions in
remembrance of his sad death.
It is understood that at tH^eir next
meeting 1 the Commissioners will thor
oughly investigate the conduct of the po
lioemen who were behind the dead officer
while he was in the performance of his
duty. Chief Lees ha.s had his men out
collecting evidence on the affair and many
witnesses will be subpoenaed.
Captain Dillon of the Seventeenth-street
station was present last evening ready to
assist the Commissioners in their Inquiry

SAVED THE COIN
FOR THE CITY
A Job That Failed to Get
Through the Super
visors.
Rotten Sidewalks About Alamo
Square That Were Not
Paid For.
The solid combination in the Board of
Supervisors tried to shove through a job
yesterday that has been an eyesore to the
taxpayers of this city for more than a
year. A resolution was introduced to pay
$950 for work on sidewalks on Fulton
street, between Scott and Steiner, the
block being one of those that bound the
notorious Alamo square.
Supervisor Britt made a speech in favor
of allowing the payment of the demand,
stating that the contractor had been kept
out of his money for more than a year,
and that it was time the contract was
paid for.
Supervisor Rottanzi wanted to know
whether this was not the Job that had
been condemned because it had been
found that the sidewalk was so rotten
that a cane could be pushed through the
concrete.
It was admitted that the work was
originally bad, but the claim was also
made that repairs had been made that
placed the sidewalk in perfect condition.
The resolution to pay the money was
finally defeated. Supervisor Britt giving
notice of reconsideration at the next
meeting.
Back of the effort to get the money is
another story. When me original con
tractor, James O'Brien, was at work, lie
sold his warrant to Henry Wiener, cashier
for Nathan Dohrmann, who discounted
the paper. When Mayor Phelan vetoed
the authorization because the job was bad
Wiener lookeo the matter over, auu. tiiiii
ing that it would cost more to repair the
sidewalk properly than he would get out
of his warrant, threw the matter* up.
Since then O'Brien has had men patch
ing up the rotten sidewalk, and now seeks
to get payment from the city.

and that the one passing through tho de
