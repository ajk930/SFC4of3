PARIS, Oct. 10.â Paris is slowly tak
ing on the appearance of a huge camp,
and troops are to be seen everywhere.
Detachments of infantry or cavalry are
on guard :it every spot where a build-
Ing; is being constructed or demolished.
Yesterday about 7000 soldiers of differ
ent arms of the service were brought
In from various points to reinforce the
military garrison of the city.
There was no disorder, it is true, but
the Government does not intend to be
taken by surprise. There is a grow
ing spirit of opposition among the
strikers. They resent as an attack
upon their chief strength the absten
tion of any department of the build-
Ing trade from their strike. Where per
suasion has failed to induce the hesi
tating workmen to Join them a mild
Bort of violence has been tried.
Some stone cutters working upon
some sculpture that will make the
Champs Elysees Hotel a remarkably
fine structure were disagreeably sur
prised the other day to find a group of
strikers calmly sawing through the tall
polos supporting the scaffolding on
which they were working. Naturally
enough they hastened to get down to
Bolid earth as quickly as possible,
where they were coolly informed they
must put on their coats and Join the
strikers In the name of solidarity of
labor.
This Is a kind of coercion the Gov
ernment has determined to stop, and
this is why so many troops are now
quartered in Paris. Every heap of
stones hides a sentry and miniature
*apÂ»pa, formed r-f half r. dozen soldiers :
with stacked rifles, add a picturesque
touch of color to the streets.
It, is indisputable that the matter has
grown to its present dimensions
through the numerical weakness of the
police and their consequent inability to
cope with large bodies of men whose
only work juat now is going about try-
Ing t<> prevent others from earning
their bread. With the presence of so j
many armed troops in Paris this state
of things should be changed; but will
It? Nkv\ -:. -a" refuse to begin work
until the trades that have formulated
grievances have also won their cause.;
This, then, is the situation; more than
40,000 workmen are idle and their ranks I
are eonsstaiuiy increasing. To control j
them there is an army which not only j
empathy for the people, but :
has a secret grievance, namely, the at- j
â  It by the Dreyfusites. What
wiil be the result if the people and
army should come in conflict?) Paris;
â in fact, France â seems on the edge of j
a axto.
Thi bricklayers and woodcarvers have
decided to go on strike.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG, Oct. 10.â Within the
brilliance of incandescence emanating
from nearly half a million electric
liphts the conclave of the Knights
Templar has now fairly started, and to
night close upon 50,000 pilgrims are
reveling in each other's hospitality.
The brilliancy of the city's street dec
orations marks an epoch in the history
of electric illumination. Within a radius
of four blocks from the heart of the city
400,000 incandescent lamps burn every
night. Huge electric crosses and em
blems of Templarism are suspended on
the sides of the city's tallest buildings,
and there is hardly a store or shop in
the downtown district which has not an
illuminated design of some Masonic sig
nificance in its windows. The result at
night is that Pittsburg presents a per
fect blaze of electric glory, with an ef
fect that has probably never been
equaled.
The day was chiefly spent by the dif
ferent commanderies in arranging their
headquarters and getting ready to re
ceive their guests and visitors. In this
respect the various delegations vied
v. ith each other in the matter of put
ting up the most inviting refreshments,
ranging from the glass of ice water up
to Kentucky bourbon, California wines
and even champagne. Souvenirs of all
shapes, sizes and designs are in abund-
ant evidence, and most of the Knights
i are bedecked with decorations not un
like a major general and veteran of at
I least twenty wars.
Although the business meeting! of
the gathering have not yet commenced
electioneering far the hom,r of holding,
; the next conclave Is in active progress.
i In this respect the Louisville people are
! apparently in the lead. Â£
Ihif afternoon the members from the
'. Minnesota commanderies virtually gave
up the contest they had expected to
make in favor of St. Paul.
Northern New York delegations are
; "plugging" for all they are worth to
l have the next conclave at Niagara
j Falls in 1901.
The foremost event of to-day's pro
gramme undoubtedly has been the re
ception and ball of Tancred Command- j
cry No. 48 of this city at their head
quarters in the Courthouse, which com
| menced at 2 o'clock this afternoon, and
It is expected that the dancing and en
tertaining, with unabated musical ac
companiment, is to continue until 12
o'clock to-night.
The sights on the streets have never
been equaled in this city, as far as the
crowds are concerned. Street car traf
fic is at a standstill and vehicles of all
kinds are banished from downtown
thoroughfares, while every inch of
ground is monopolized by tens of thou
sands of pedestrians, who move along
like an Immense wave of humanity.
Then there are those on the sidewalks,
shouting and applauding the parading
Knights as they pass in an appar
ently never-ending column through the
streets. ,
The five local commanderies opened
thf-ir headquarters and started the ball
rolling. The day was largely taken up
with receptions and in welcoming the
Influx of visitors, also with a reception
In honor of Grand Master Thomas and
Governor Hastings of Pennsylvania.
j The real work of the conclave will

FEVER SITUATION GROWS
SERIOUS IN THE SOUTH
JACKSON, Miss., Oct. 10.â The fever six .atlon here is more serious to-day, with the appearance of the
disease in North Jackson. There is now no section of the city free of infection and new cases are multiply
ing rapidly.
The official report for to-day is nine new cases. One of the new cases is Rev. L. S. Foster, superintend
ent of the Baptist Orphanage, where the fever appeared two or three days ago. Dr. J. H. Purnell, State
Health Officer, In charge here, issued a proclamation to-day urging that all parties who can possibly do so
leave at once for northern or other points that will receive refugees.
Dr. Hunter, secretary of the State Board of Health, officially reports as follows: Dr. Purnrll reports a
case of genuine yellow fever at Canton. Waveland has three new cases to-day. Harriston has fourteen new
cases, fifty-five under treatment. Madison has fifteen new cases. Oxford reports one new case. Edwards
reports two new cases, one death. Four suspicious cases are reported south of Crystal Springs. Taylors re
ports one new case. Orrwood reports six new cases and one death.
NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 10.â Dr. Souchon reports the following for Louisiana's yellow fever record for Sun
day, October 9: New Orleans, four cases, five deaths; Wilson, four casea. no deaths; Houma, ten cases, no
deaths; Franklin, fourteen cases, one death. Record for Monday, October 10: New Orleans, no cases, no deaths;
Clinton, three cases, no deaths; Wilson, four cases, no deaths; one case of fever Is reported at Lake Chartres.
The New Orleans Board of Health has declared all danger of epidemic past and has asked the State
board to permit the city to open Its doors to all points.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10. â The appeal made to President McKlnley by the State Board of Health authori
ties at Jackson, Miss., for aid In the way of subsistence and medical help to meet the conditions arising from
the yellow fever situation has been referred to the Marine Hospital Service. Dr. Wyman, the surgeon general,
feels that the situation is not at all alarming, and says that, while the fever may spread slightly, it is only
a question of time when with the appearance of cold weather it will be checked.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 10.â The suspicious death which occurred to-day on board the Norwegian steamer
Banan at Reedy Island, In Delaware Bay, has been diagnosed by the quarantine station as yellow fever.
the California commandery for its open
reception. Not wishing to miss a view
of one of the great industries for which
Pittsburg is noted the visitors from
San Francisco started about 9 o'clock
In the morning. Homestead is about
seven miles from Pittsburg, and the
delegation composing the majority of
-the commandery and their ladies was
taken up the beautiful Monongahela
Valley on the trolley cars, which landed
them near the steel works entrance In
a half hour. Here the visitors were met
by President C. M. Schwab of the Car
negie Company and the superintendents
of the various departments of the mills.
The works occupy an immense area
and every inch was of interest. The
armor plate mill was most interesting.
The process of turning thÂ£ red hot bars
of steel into heavy plate drew praise from
the visitors. Those who had already
seen the Union Iron Works still re
tained their admiration for their native
firm, but the size of this one depart
ment, a part of the whole Carnegie
Company, impressed them. The manu
facture of steel rails and the process in
the blast furnaces was prominent in the
praise of the Callfornians.
Many of the visitors asked about the
fight between the Pinkerton detectives
and the steel works strikers on July 6,
1892, and went over the bloody battle
ground. They were shown the heavy
iron work behind which the strikers
stood with suns and repelled the land
ing of the Plnkertons, who came up the
Monongahela River.
About 1 o'clock the sightseers took
passage on a train and returned to the
city. Another special Invitation had
been extended them to pass a pleasant
afternoon and it was accepted. Tho
hosts for the afternoon were the mem
bers of Pittsburg Commandery No. 1,
whose headquarters are in the building I
of the Pittsburg Central High School i
on Fifth avenue. These quarters had
been magnificently decorated and [
adorned and were only exceeded by the
hospitality of the Pittsburg Sir Knights
and their ladies, who showed the Cali
fornians every attention. The after
noon was exclusively for the people of
the Golden Gate city. There was music
furnished by the orchestra of the enter
taining commandery and the quartet
of the California Commandery. com
j posed of C. T. Wejidell, Dr. R. W.
i Smith, L. A. Larsen and E. G. Macbain.
The grand parade is scheduled for to
| morrow and California Knights will be
prominent. The magnificent silver- ;
trimmed uniforms of the members have
already attracted universal attention,
and their appearance in the parade fifty
strong on fine black chargers, decorated
with the private trappings, will be
eagerly watched for ay the Pittsburg
people who have all heard of California
No. 1.
MaÂ»ny of the *old Sir Knjghts and
friends of the commandery remember
ing the conclave of 1883 have been sug
gesting to the California Knights that
another trip to San Francisco in 1901
would not be unpleasant. Several of
the San Franciscans have been eager
to get the next encampment, but they
do not care to state definitely whether
an official attempt is being or will be
made to secure It.
REMARKABLE
DISCLOSURES
SHOCK SOCIETY
Charles 'A, Williams, Mine-
Owner, Proves a Fugitive
From Justice.
Identified in San Francisco on the Eve
of His Marriage With a Prominent
Social Leader.
Society people of this city were aston
ished when the engagement was an
nounced recently of Charles A. Williams,
a mine owner from South Africa, to one
of the most beautiful belles of this city â
a reigning favorite with all. Society
stood aghast yesterday when it was dis-
I closed that Mr. Williams, millionaire
clubman and society beau, was passing
under an assumed name, being known in
other cities as Charles A. White; that he
was a fugit.'vc from Justice cjic a :vife
beater.
When the first rumors of Mr. Williams'
past career reached the family of his be
trothed, the members of It were loth to
believe them. When proof of his mis
deeds accumulated they were forced to take
I cognizance of them. Mr. Wttliams paved
I the way for his own destruction by pos
ing before his fiancee as a martyred hero,
telling a fanciful tale in which he ad
mitted having changed his name to escape
the calumny heaped upon it by the mis
doings of a former' wife.
The following information was received j
j from New York by a friend of the family,
j and was the first intimation of tfre true
state of affairs:
Charles A. White was arrested in New
York on October 15, 1892, upon a requisi
tion from Wyoming for larceny of money
and securities aggregating about $100,000.
'. White was tall, good looking, business
i like and about 35 years of age. He had
I won the affections of Mrs. Elma J.
: Nagle of Cheyenne. She was SE years o*d
j and the widow of Erasmus Nagle of
Cheyenne, Wyo., who had \&t\. her an es
tate of more than half a million dollars.
White, it was charged, had backed up
his attractive personality by saying he
was the manager of the American edition
of the London Illustrated News at a sal
ary of $1000 a month. He was, in fact,
only a canvasser at a much smaller sal
ary- Mrs. White, previous to the mar
riage, moved in the best of society. Af
ter she wedded White she was cut by her
old friends, most of whom believed that
White was an adventurer. When Mrs.
White sued for a divorce, the whole truth
came out. The petition told of continu
ous abuse from the first week of their
union. White living entirely on the bounty
of the woman, abusing her servants and
beating them. The last thing he did be
fore leaving for New York, it is alleged,
was to blacken his wife's eyes and beat
her into insensibility. The case was
brought to the attention of the New "fcork
police by the receipt of this telegram to
Superintendent Byrnes on September 17,
1892:
CHEYENNE, Wyo.
To Byrnes, Superintendent of Police, New
York: Get boy named George Nagle. light hair
and complexion, heavy build, blue eyes, short
stature, 16 years old, round face. In care of C.
A. White. Is supposed to be staying at St.
James Hotel. He is wanted here by his mother
at once. Boy has large estate. White Is
scheming to get control of It by secreting boy.
White has about $150,000 worth of stocks, bonds
and mortgages belonging to boy's mother. These
stocks were obtained by violence and fraud.
Case against him Just commenced In court here.
Papers will be prepared charging White with
embezzlement and kidnaping, and requisition
asked ' for. If boy cannot be found or White
refuses to give him up, arrest White at once
and hold him for requisition. W. R. STOLL.,
Attorney for George Nagle and Nagle Estate.
A second and confirmatory dispatch,
received by Superintendent Byrnes later
in the day, read:
Obtain possession of George H. Nagle at St.
James Hotel, described In telegram by George
R. Stoll. Deliver him to R. Tenbroeck, general
agent Union Pacific Railway, and make every
effort. This Is Important.
W. R. SCHNITGER, Chief of Police.
Two detectives were at once sent to the
St. James Hotel and found White had left
that morning, accompanied by young
Nagle. Sheriff Kelly of Cheyenne arrived
with requisition papers on October 5.
White was located and arrested during
the afternoon. In the meantime he
learned that the Cheyenne police had
complained to Superintendent Byrnes
about his detention of young Nagle and
he promptly put the boy on a westbound
train and sent him to Rock Island, Illi
nois., where the boy's grandmother lived.
When taken into custody he said his mar
riage was a purely business proposition,
that he sold himself to the widow for
$100,000. As ready money was short, he
took $25,000 cash and a ' mortgage of
$75,000. Mrs. White insisted that so
far as she was concerned it was
a love match and that the mortgage
which White finally obtained was extort
ed under a threat of violence. After a
few weeks of marriage the bride said she
found her dashing, young husband setting
up a stable, running a pack of hounds
and absenting himself for long trips to
Chicago. White left Cheyenne on Septem
ber 6, taking with him $IW.OOO of Mrs.
White's property. He came direct to New
York and at one* assigned his $75,000
mortgage to the Central Trust Company,
it is said, without a consideration. A charge
of grand larceny was preferred against
White in Wyoming and a requisition for
him was obtained from Acting Governor
Barber.
It was alleged that White had stolen
from his wife the property he carried off,
consisting of bonds worth $61,850 and
about $40,000 in cash. White scouted the
Idea that he would steal anything, and
while he admitted he could never love
his "elderly" wife, he would fulfill his
part of the contract and manage* her
business and her money if given a
chance. He said he would be perfectly
willing to return to Wyoming If he could
be assured of a fair trial, but public
opinion had been prejudiced against him.
He was sure that repeated threats of
tar and feathers it he ever appeared in
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the country again would be put Into ex
ecution.
As soon as Governor Flower aa^d that
i White must go back to Wyoming. White's
j attorneys procured a writ of habeas cor
pus In the United States Circuit Court.
Upon a hearing October 28 the writ
was dismissed and WhÂ£e was remanded.
j Appeal was at once ta/ken to the United
, States Circuit Court of Appeals. Mean
| while things were moving on both sides
in Wyoming. White's attorneys appealed
to the new Governor, Osborne, to recall
the requisition. This request he refused.
Mrsx White at the same time sued for di
vorce and obtained it. Suits were also
commenced in New York and Cheyenne
against the holders of securities to whom
White had made transfers, and Injunc
tions were Issued restraining their trans
fer. Pending the decision, on appeal.
White was admitted to bail In the sum
of $10,000. On March 24. 1893. White failed
to appear when his name was called in
the United States Circuit Court, and an
order was Issued forfeiting his ball in the
sum of $10,000. White had not been Seen
at his attorneys' office for about two
months prior to that time, and all efforts
to find him by his prosecutors subse
quently proved unavailing. A charge of
embezzlement was made and a reward of
$500 was offered by the Sheriff of Lara
mie. Wyoming, for White'? .apprehension
and return to him, but the fugitive's
whereabouts were never ascertained. Re
ports reached Wyoming and New York
authorities from time to time that he had
been seen In China, England and South
Africa, but no trace of him was ever
found.
From Wyoming came the following:
CHEYENNE. Wyo., Oct. 10.â In the Kummer
of 1892 Mm. Emma Nagle, a wealthy widow of
this city, met Charles White at Arkansas Hot
Springs. White was a handsome fellow of
about 30. about six feet one inch tall, and at
that time had a light mustache. He repre
sented himself to be one of the owners of
the London Illustrated News, with an office In
New York. Mrs. Nagle fell in love with White
and they became engaged. He Induced her to
execute an ante-nuptial contract, agreeing to
pay him $100,000 during the first year of their
married life. The marriage took place here in
September, 1892. Before six months passed
White had In his control the greater part of his
j wlfe'.s estate, amounting to several hundred
thousand dollars. Before the close of the year
his wife brought an action for divorce for
alleged extreme cruelty, charging that White
knocked hfir down and beat her. He was also
charged with embezzlement of the funds of bis
wife and with larceny.
He left here when these suits were com
menced and requisition was made on the State
authorities of New York for him. He fought
the requisition In the courts and, pending a
decision, forfeited his ball, which was $10,000
cash, and fled to South America.
' Subsequently his wife was granted a divorce
and recovered about $50,000 in securities which
White had carried away but could not dis
pose of.
The indictment for embezzlement and iarceny
stood against White )n the courts here until
about a year ago, when they were nolle prossed.
During White's residence here he posed as a
literary man, claiming to be a writer for the
New York World, author of several books and
part owner of the London Illustrated News.
Later it was learned he had been employed as
advertising solicitor for the latter publication.
He was plausible In speech, rather engaging In
manner and fastidious in dress.
Mr. Williams arrived here early last
spring and soon had an entree to the best
society. He became a popular beau at
the watering places and elsewhere, enter
taining lavishly. He had a magnetic per
sonality, pleasing all with whom he came
in contact. Tales of his great wealth and
of his lavish entertainment soon gave him
a following. Although his entertaining
was lavish it was not ostentatious, thua
tending to allay any suspicion that society
might have had of a newcomer.
The announcement of his engagement
to a popular belle excited comment. The
romantic situation surrounding the case,
however, explained away many of the
unusual circumstances surrounding the
betrothal. Preparations for the wedding
were hurried. The bridal finery was to
be purchased abroad; part of the honey
moon was to be spent in the rich diamond
fields of Johannesburg, South Africa.
The cause of the hurried nuptials appear
ed plausible when it was announced that
the fiance's vast African Interests de
manded his immediate attention and that
a lengthy separation of the lovers was out
of the question.
Although the attachement of the young
couple Is said to be a matter of over a
year's standing, rumor linked the name of
the African mine owner with those of a
trio of beautiful buds. When society had
calmed down, after its first shock of sur
prise, the engagement of the young couple
was voted as a most natural thing. The
beauty of the young bride to be; her
grace, her charm, her wit and her many
accomplishments were such as would at
tract any traveled man of the world. Mr.
Williams was a most devoted fiance. He â¢
showered the lady of his choice with rare
jewels. It was understood these many
costly gifts would rank as trifles when
compared with the gifts which awaited
her when she became his wife.
The limited period between the engage
ment and the time set for the nuptials
did not permit of the young lady's pre
senting him to all her acquaintances.
Duty calls were paid to the nearest and
most Intimate friends of the fiancee, and
with these Mr. Williams made a favor
able impression.
The weddinsr was set for to-morrow at
4vO'clock. On account of a recent be
reavement in the .bride's family only the
nearest relatives were to be present at
the ceremony. It had been arranged that
the happy couple would leave Immedi
ately after the ceremony, and after a
brief visit to London and Paris would
proceed to South Africa, where Mr. Wil
liams was to give six months' time tQ
his business Interests.2
FRANCE UNWILLING
TO SHOW FIGHT
So England May Retain
Fashoda.
SALISBURY'S POLICY UPHELD
PARIS GOVERNMENT WILL NOT
PRESS ITS CLAIM.
Will Find a Way Out in Causing
Major Marthand to Report
That His Position Is
Untenable.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 10.â The comments iv
the newspapÂ«ra show that the Marquis
of Salisbury's determined stand on the
qui'stion of the occupation of Fashoda
has, come as a most agreeable relief,
and as disposing of all theories of com
promise. No whisper <>f dissert is heard
anywhere. Both friends and opponents
of the Premier are rejoicing in the fact
that in publishing the blue book on
the Fashoda question he has burned
his bridges behind him.
While it is recognized that the situa
tion, by this publication, has become
more difficult for France, there is almost
entire absence of disposition anywhere
to believe that France proposes to press
her claims to the point of danger, and
this confidence was demonstrated by
the capital tone of the Stock Exchange
after a momentary eeare, and such com
ment as comes from Paris also tends
to abate alarm.
The Matin, which is directly inspired
by the French officials, v ices to-day
the more pacific mood which Is ap
parently obtaining in Paris, savins:
"We shall probably not risk a war with
<;r<';u Britain for nominal sovereignty
over territory at an immense distance
from our possessions on the Atlantic.
They are as inaccessible from our coast
as the mountains in the moon. We can
retain our honor without retaining Fa
shoda. Prudence should prevent us
from overloading ourselves with too
much territory. We must be colonial,
but In moderation."
Th<- newspapers of Paris this evening
take a calm view of the situation/and
. for moderation. They express a
re desire for a friendly settlement
of the question when Major Marchand's
report arrives.
But th- prevailing view of political
men i.s that the French Cabinet may
find a way out of the difficulty in the
expei ted from Major Marchand,
who, it is expected, In response to a
hint from i he French Foreign Office,
will declare that his position at Fa
i is untenable. The publication of
such a report, it is held, will fully
justify the French Government in re
calllng him.
A prominent member of the French
Embassy In London expressed these
views on the situation this evening:
"The advent of the French and Brit
ish on the upper Nile ought not to be
rded as the meeting of opposing
tea, which necessarily ekclttde one
another, hut as the clash of commercial
Interests which should be carefully de
fined and embodied in a permanent
meat; The war, which has no;
been provoked by the question of
Egypt, will cert "i inly not break out over
th>- upper Nile question. The issue at
Fashcda will be settled in a friendly
manner, to the general satisfaction, but
an agreement will be much more easily
reached when the newspapers of the
two countries cease exciting public
opinion."
The nvrnine: papers all renew their
comments on the Pashoda situation,
but on neither side of the channel is any
idea given that the affair is likaJy to
lead to war.
The worst that can happen is the res- |
fgrnati.n of M. del Casse, the French !
n Minister, or perhaps the whole
Ministry, but were it not for the deli
cate internal situation in Franco arts-
Ui of the Dreyfus affair and the
strike the Fashoda affair would involve
no danger whati â¢
DECIDEDLY OPPOSED TO
ANGLO-AMERICAN ALLIANCE
Stand Taken by the Parnell Conven
tion, at Which John E. Red
mond Presided.
DUBLIN, Oct. 10.â The Parnell conven
tion w;i; opened lure to-day. John E.
Redmond, presiding, said that it was in
credible that a statesman with Mr.
Chamberlain's experience ami astuteness
should declare that the passing
of the Irish local government bill
satisfied trie aspirations of Irishmen. The
Parnellites would not be satisfied until
they secured hum?- rule.
Resolutions were passed in favor of
home rule, approving the- local govern
ment act, <l<-n<!uncing the project of an
Anglo-American alliance, and urging the
release of political prisoners.
The following Is the text of the reso
lution denouncing the proposal of an An
glo-American alliance:
"This convention denounces the pro
jf-et of an alliance between Great Britain
HOd the United States as a selfish at
tempt on the part of England to drag
the American people to its aid in Its
struggles with the powers of Europe,
among which it now stands, by reason
of its bad faith, absolutely isolated. Con
sequently, as friends of America, we, the
members of this convention, hope that
the republic will not allow itself to be
embroiled in European squabbles from
which, however, these may result. It
cannot derive any corresponding advan
tag for American interests."
FOR THE GLADSTONIAN

John Dillon Makes a Practical Bid
for the Reunion of the Sections

GLASGOW. Oct. 10.â John Dillon, anti-
Parnolllte member of Parliament for
East Mayo, at a banquet given here this
evening in his honor, made a practical bid
for the reunion of the sections of the
Irish party. IT*- Bald he wished ihnt a con
ference of ten representative. Irishmen
half nominated by John Redmond, and
the other half by himself, could meet and
draft a scheme to reconcile the differences
among the Irish Nationalists, the scheme
to be submitted. to the leading 1 Irishmen
of the country* at a convention. >
Mr. Dillon' said ho would be willing to
enter such a conference on the basis of
absolute independence of all the English
parties, and declared himself convinced
that there was no real, substantial cliff
ence to prevent the co-operation of all Na
tional members of Parliament In support
of the Gladstonian policy of home rue.

ALL CLASSES.
Particularly Will the Pacific States
Increase Its Commerce to
China and the
Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Oct. 10.â The annual Chi
cago day celebration of the Hamilton
Club was held to-day in the Auditorium
Theater. Chauncey M. Depew, as guest
of the club, was the principal speaker
and the great hall was packed to suf
focation long before the hour set for
his appearance. Just previous to the
introduction by President Cody of
Judge Peter S. Grosscup, who spoke
briefly, battle songs and national an
thems were given by a chorus of 200
voices, assisted by the United States
Marine Band and the Auditorium or
gan.
At the conclusion of Judge Gross
cup's speech Mr. Depew was introduced
amid wild applause. He spoke in part
as follows:
"For over fifty years American
statesmen have grappled with, but
failed to solve, the problems of Cuba, j
Hawaii and a canal through the Nica
raguan isthmus. Hawaii seemed essen
tial for the protection of our Pacific
Coast, and Cuba, by its frightful mis
government under Spanish rule, en
listed our sympathy and aroused our
indignation. The irreconcilable division
in Democratic Cabinets made action on
the part of our Government either for
the acquisition of Hawaii or for peace
and humanity in Cuba absolutely im
possible. The responsibility of govern
ing these countries and the Philippines
is great, but the policy of governing
them by recognizing the manhood of i
their peoples has never been tried. The I
inhabitants of these islands will re
spond to the effort of a great, generous
and free people to teach and help them
to govern themselves. In the meantime
their increasing productiveness and the
varying industries which will be intro
duced make these distant possessions
self-sustaining and sources of revenue.
Not only that, but they will be the
growing markets for our goods. Every
one who is familiar with the Pacific .
coast appreciates the limitations which
are placed upon its opportunities."
"The mountains of Oregon and
Washington are full of cÂ»al and iron,
but they cannot compete with the coal
and iron east of the Rocky Mountains.
California raises 20,000,000 bushels of
wheat a year, but its market is too dis
tant for profit. We become masters of
the Philippines and have the harbor for
our men-of-war, and our merchant ves
seli at Manila will ht- in striking dia- !
tance of -China at the moment when j
that old empire is crumbling to pieces, j
"The open market of Japan and the
opening of China will absorb not only
all the wheat now grown upon the Pa
cific Coast, but all it can possibly pro
duce. Its markets will be so great for
our steel rails, our machinery and elec
trical appliances and our agricultural j
implements that, with a merchant ma
rine on the Pacific, Oregnn, Washing
ton and California will in a few years
be among the richest and most produc
tive States of the Union.
"There is in the trade the opening of
a new field for labor and new oppor
tunities for capital. The congestion <>f
our market will be revived, causes of
panics will be lessened, the farmers of j
the West and the Middle West and of
the Northwest will find themselves bet
ter able to compete in the markets of
Europe, with Argentina, Russia,
Egypt and India. The wheat of the I
Pacific Coast will go to the Orient in- j
stead of Liverpool. Civilization and
Christianity and orderly liberty follow-
Ing the flag will bestov.- inestimable j
benefits upon distant somi-barbarous I
and alien races. There will be to our (
own people reciprocal benefits which
conic from a thousand millions instead
of seventy millions of people wanting
the products of our soil, the results of
our agriculture, the output of our
mines and the surplus of our mills, our
factories and our furnaces."

to minister to the sufferings of the
wounded. It was in this capacity she
met the Belgian nobleman. v

Which the Cfyppewa Chiefs
Evidently Approve.
WALKER. Minn., Oct. 10.â The Indian council was held at the
agency this afternoon and was attended by Flat Mouth and repre
sentative delegations. General Bacon aj>d Inspector Tinker told the
Bear Islanders that if they would give up the men for whom war/
rants have been Issued and come in themselves they could go home.
If they resisted the Government would not rest till the recalcitrants
had been captured, and the Bear Islanders were not then to be
allowed to occupy the islands again. The message was read to the
hostiles by runners to-day. General Bacon's terms werS~Teceived by
the chiefs with signs of evident pleasure, and they all signified their
approval of them. It is believed the Pillagers will accept them.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 10.â The following telegram has just been

listed.
Special Plspatch to The Call.
SAUSALITO, Oct. 10.â Private Ed
ward Downs of Battery B, Heavy Ar
tillery, stationed at Fort Baker, after
forty-three days' confinement in the
guard house at Fort Baker, made his
escape last Friday evening, successfully
passing six armed guards.
On the 25th of last August, Downs,
while in an intoxicated condition, tied
his blankets into a roll and left the
camp at night. He was discovered at
Bausallto and brought back by armed
guards. He was then placed in the
guard house and papers were sent to
Washington preparatory to a court
martial. He was charged with deser
tion, and his court martial was to have
taken place to-day at the Presidio.
At about 2 o'clock Saturday morning
Downs slipped from under the back
of his tent and made his way over the
hills to Sausallto, and not until thÂ©
corporal of the guard made his early
round was his absence detected. As
Boon as Captain Hay was apprised of
the escape he gave orders and soon the
camp was in an uproar. Armed squads
were sent to search the hills, while
guards were stationed at the ferries in
San Francisco, Tlburon and Sausalito.
The search was futile. Downs remains
at large.
There seems to be a big story behind
the escape of this man which the offi
cers are trying to conceal. Lieutenant
Hughey was reluctant to speak of the
matter to-night and would not give the
escape's name. From certain of the
privates it was learned that the men
are poorly fed, and all of them are
sorry that they enlisted. Downs, like
the rest of them, came from San Fran
cisco. About two jveeke ago- a large
batch of beef seat to the men was so
tainted that it had to be thrown into
the baj* Several of the privates feel
so bitter on account of their treatment
that they assert that they would not
tell where Downs is even if they knew.
INVESTIGATION OF
THE WAR SCANDALS
Three Witnesses Before the Commis

WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.â The War In
vestigation Commission had three wit
nesses before It to-day. Captain Culver
of Grigsby's Rough Riders, Dr. Hysell.
chief surgeon of the Second Division, lo
cated at Camp Thomas, and Major Gal
lagher, who was in charge of various
commissary depots in the Santiago cam
paign. Dr. Hysell's testimony dealt with
thÂ« sanitary and hospital conditions at
Camp Thomas. He saJd that there was
leps typhoid fever in the troops of the
Second Division than in the otker divis
ions, and stated that upon his advice,
this division had secured its water from
outside springs instead of from the
Chiekamauga Riveiv as he conÃide;ed the
river wafr liable to be impure.
Major Gallagher detailed the process of
supplying rations to the troops in tho
(Leva. ' H^ said that at one time there was
a deficiency In coffee and sugar for two
days, and expressed the opinion that this
shortage would have proven serious If it
had continued for any length of time. He
said the supply of lighters was not suffi
cient to permit of the accumulation of
any considerable quantity of food at one
time.

LYNCHING THREATENED
IN A WASHINGTON TOWN
Citizens May Avenge the Shooting
of an Everett Merchant by an
Editor.
SEATTLE, Oct. 10.â Feeling runs
high to-night at the neighboring city of
Everett over a probably fatal shooting
affray. John McConnella, editor of the
News, shot O. L. Nelson, a fuel merchant,
in the right side of the lower part of the
stomach. The wounded man is at the
point of -death. MeConnella was placed
under arrest late to-night and a strong
guard surrounds the Jail. Numerous
threats of lynching are heard. It is feared
that an attempt to wreak vengeance on
McConnella may be made before morn
ing.
The editor is a vindictive writer and
about two weeks ago published an article
in which Nelson was referred to as a fooT
and a knave. The victim of this alleged
slanderous attack expressed his opinion
of the writer in equally forcible terms.
This evening both men met in a personal
encounter and McConnela made three at
tempts to strike Nelson. The latter is a
large man, aiid, after pushing his assail
ant away, finally threw him down. Mc-
Connella then drew a revolver and fired a
shot that will likely prove fatal.
DEAFNESS AND RHEUMATISM.
Not Disregarded by the Commis

WASHINGTON, Oct. iv.â There has

originating at the recent annual encamp
ment of the G. A. R. at Cincinnati that
"the Commissioner of Pensions had called
his chiefs together and instructed them
to disregard totally every application
based on deafness ami rheumatism In the
adjudication of claims for pensions."
The Commissioner has authorized a
statement that no such Instructions were
given; that there has probably not been
a single working- day passed since April
1. 1897, that there has not been certifi
cates issued for both deafness and rheu
matism, and that there has been no
change in the laws, therefore no change

ESPOUSE THE
SPANISH CAUSE
Paris Newspapers Plead
for Generosity.
TAFFY FOR UNCLE SAM
PEACE COMMISSIONEBS AND
THE PHILIPPINE QUESTION.
Meanwhile the Dona Are Carrying
Out the Agreement to Evacuate
. Cuba and Porto
Rico.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 10.â It is believed the
questions now being discussed by the
'Peace Commission relate to Cuba and
the adjustment of the debt of that
island.
The Paris newspapers show evidence
of anxiety in behalf of the Spanish
cause.
The Matin, on Sunday, alleged that an
understanding regarding Cuba' and
Porto Rico was possible, as the United
States claims everything and Spain re
fuses nothing; but the difficulty arises
on the question of the Philippine Is
lands.
The Matin closed its remarks on the
subject by expressing the belief that
"we shall sea the republic, which has
just shown herself to be so brave and
strong, show herself also generous."
As the joint commissions have not
yet considered the Philippine question
the Paris papers appear to Americans
as making the statement that the Phil
ippines are under consideration in order
to be in a position to abjure the Ameri
can commission to treat Spain gener
ously.
The Gaulois this morning reviews the
political situation and declares its con
clusions that "between the alleged re
ported purpose of expansion and the
Democratic opposition thereto President
McKinley and the United States com
mission will be inspired after all with
the sentiments of generosity which are
the honor of victorious *nations."
The keynote of these expressions
seems to have been sounded by a Span
ish diplomat to an American here last
week, thqjdiplomat saying that the
United States shouldf be generous to
Spain.
A dispatch from Madrid this morn
ing says the cost of the Cuban and the
Philippine campaigns will exceed 3,000,
000,000 pesetas.
M. Jules Cambon, the former French
Embassador at Washington, arrived in
Paris to-day. He will remain here for
two months.

PARIS, Oct. 11.â The Figaro in an ar
ticle this morning confirms the state
ment that the Philippine question is
the stumbling block of the Peace Com
mission, and says that the reply of the
Spanish Government should arrive in
time for to-day's sitting.
EVACUATION OF CUBA
AND PORTO RICO
MADRID, Oct. 10.â It is said here
that the evacuation of Porto Rico will
be completed next week and that of
Cuba by the end of November. The
Government is employing twenty-one
vessels in the repatriatton of tho
troops. The soldiers have received
their pay for June, and on landing in
Spain they will receive two months'
pay, be given civilian clothing and be
mustered out of the service.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.â Advices re
ceived at the War Department indicate
that the evacuation dt Cuba by the
Spanish forces is proceeding satisfac
torily and smoothly. The threatened
trouble at Manzanillo has blown over
and the Spaniards have yielded control
to the American forces. The following
dispatch was received to-night at the
War Department:
"HAVANA, Oct. 10.â Adjutant Gen

will soon be opened and manufacturing commenced in this city, especially
if the elections in November confirm the judgment of the people two years
ago.

SPANISH DIATRIBE
AGAINST MERRITT
Manila Editor's Abuse
of the General.
BITTERLY ASSAILS AMERICANS
PRESS CENSOR OVERLOOKS THE
INSULTS.
Permits Foreign Papers to Say What
They Please, but Carefully Re
vises the Correspondents'
Cablegrams.
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
MANILA, Sept. I.â The Spanish
newspapers in Manila are reveling in
an unprecedented atmosphere of free
dom and criticise the American author
ities as they never would have dared
criticise their own Government, for the
Spanish censor has now joined the
great army of unemployed and the
United States army censor confines his
attention to cablegrams going abroad.
He will not, he says, permit a word to
be said In any way derogatory to the
United States army or authorities, but
he takes no notice of violent, inflam
matory diatribes daily exciting the
people of the Philippines against the
Americans. He lets Spaniards say
what they like to their readers, while
he refuses to trust the American peo
ple and loyal American Journalists.
The Oceania Espanola of August 31
contains a fierce article entitled
"Chaos," pointing out that no other
word can describe the condition of Ma
nila under Its new rulers. The article
complains that the American authori
ties have removed public officials and
have failed to appoint their successors,
thereby creating great confusion and
hardship to the population of the Phil
ippines. The editorial says:
Thousands of poor tradespeople, labor
ers, contractors and others, have been
doing business for the municipal au
thorities of the different wards, and now
everything is stopped and the poor peo
ple cannot even get the money due them
for work dono or goods supplied prior to
the surrender. To thousands 1 in this city
one small silver dollar makes all the dif
ference betwfen starvation and content
ment, yet all the dollars In the treasury
have been seized by the Americans. Per
haps some day all debts will be paid, but
the artisan, the street sweeper, the small
storekeeper, who does not know where to
morrow's dinner will come from, cannot
feed his family on the song of "Some
Day."
The Government pawnshop and savings
bnnk is an American volunteer headquar
ters. How many thousands of people
therefore c.ur.^e the Americans; people
who have been ready to bless them,
ready to welcome them as liberators, un
til they find themselves nt liberty to
starve "pending negotiations."
There is no blame to the Americans for
not being ready all in a minute to run
a complicated organization entirely
strange to them, but in the name of rea
son and humanity there is severe blame
for stopping one machine before the other
is ready. It has caused and is causing
an indescribable amount of misery among
the many thousands of poor people in
Manila.
General Merritt was quick enough to
grab the customs and get his staff work
ing there, because the customs may be
milkej,! as richly as a good Swiss cow.
But attending to the public wants of a
poor populace is not remunerative, and
he not only neglects it himself, but pre
vents others going on with it as of old.
SOLDIER MOB FORMED
TO LYNC-I KITCHEN
Attempt to Avenge the Killing of a
Deserter by the Provost
Guard.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct. 19.â As a result
of the killing of a private in the Twelfth
New York Regiment by Provost Guard
Kitchen last night, three or four hundred
members of that regiment formed a mob
to-night and seized a train at Camp
Hamilton with the intention of coming to
town on It and raiding the County Jail
for the purpose of taking Kitchen out and
lynching him. General Wiley and Colonel
Wood were quickly notified of the up
rising and suppressed the mob by prompt
action. The outbreak was not unexpected
and the Jail was heavily guarded. The
provost guard in the city was doubled and
things are quiet at midnight. It is be
lieved that the prompt measures that
were taken have prevented what prom
ised to be a very serious affair.
Fighting for a Trademark.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 10.â Judge Wel
born in the United States District Court
to-day granted a decree of perpetual in
junction against William Davison of
Fresno, which prohibits him from using
the bottles and labels of the Hennessy
Bros. Company of France. Hennessy
Bros, brought sutt against Davison, who
is a wine merchant of Fresno, and about
a dozen others, alleging that they were
infringing on their trademark. This is the
first case decided.
Admiral Sampson Better.
HAVANA, Oct. 10.â Rear Admiral
Sampson is feeling much better. He has
been at the Hotel Trocha to-day. The
other members of the commission are in
excellent health.

One Lively Incident on the Klondike Caused
by an Attempt to Make a Consul
Lower Old Glory.
MWSON CITY. Aug. 21.â Three der
elict steamers, with which the river be
low is reported to be strewn for its en
tire long length, have arrived since my
last letter. They are the Yukoner of
the Canadian Pa<ific Navigation Com
pany, the James Domville, belonging to
Colonel James Donvllle, M. P., and the
Columbian of the Canadian Develop
; -nt Company. They are all Cana
dian boats. The X. A. T. Company's
fi.-amer Barr, another new one, is ex
ito arrive to-morrow. The Rock
Islam! Xi'. 1 is laid up between Forty
Mile and Circle City with a bursted
boiler. The Rock Island No. 2is with
her, as is also the Linda, of what is
known its the Litbes Company, that
landed some freight here a week ago
and returned to the flats to recover a
barge. She lÂ«-ft there and is fast on the
bar near Circle City.
The steamer Rock Island has been
stranded in the flats for nearly a
month. The Columbian pulled her off
and in doing so got stuck herself and
suffered a few days' delay.
The N. A. T. Company's new steamer
T. G. Power arrived on the 16th. She
sailed yesterday for St. Michael.
The Columbian will run hereafter to
White Horse Kapids, connecting with
steamers and transportation lines for
Lake Bennett and the outside. fche
[a a modern steamer and will be the
-: of the upper river fleet and the
supplying meals on board and
â¢â¢rths. Whether she can get ;
Qk and Five Finger rapids is
yet v be tested. The little steamer j
Anglian, now plying on the upper river, ,
belongs to the same company. Both
Intended for the Stickeen j
r route, but have given that up for
.- a poor job.
The Alaska Commercial Company s
new steamer Louise, in charge of Cap- j
tain Dlxon, one of the oldest and best:
of the river captains, arrived on Mon
day with two barges and 900 tons of
it. She had no through passen
and departing on Wednesday took
out but half a dozen, among them
Maguire, who goes out to Ot
tawa, having resigned his position.
The little Bteamer Willie Irving that
! up the river on Tuesday re
turned yesterday, disabled by a break
In her boiler. Among her passengers
bound out was Prosecuting Attorney
Wade, also going to report to Ottawa.
The Irving was repaired and sails to
day for the White Horse.
Reports come here of a big strike of
- at Lake At: n that ar-' attracting
a number up the river. I only j
know of the vaguest rumor and vouch
not at all.
Two incidents of more than momen
tary Interest have given variety to the
gossip of ihe mines within a few days.
The first was an altercation between
United Siat.- Consul General McCook,
who recently arrived here, and Cana
dian Customs Inspector Davis. Mr.
Davis has long had his oflice in the
i story of the Alaska Commercial
pany's building. General McCook
Line with letters to the Commercial
Company's agents and accepted the
's offer to make his office in the
m with Davis, a railing only
separating the d>eks of the two offi
cials. All went well for several days,
although General McCook's quarters
were visited continually by American
citizens who congratulated themselves
ihe arrival here of an official rep
resentative of their Government in
- that probably offended the ears
of the Canadian official. A high Hag
reaches up from the gable of the
building and on this Inspector Davis
was accustomed to raise a Hag upon
the arrival of a steamer. It is, of
course, an English Hag. General Me
Cook, without knowledge of this habit
and according to the custom of Con
the world over, raised on this staff
the American flag in token of his office
established there. Upon the arrival
of the steamer Linda a few days ago
both officials went aboard of her in
their official capacity. They met and
Inspector Davis said to General Mc
by way of a somewhat brusque
greeting, "Mr. McCook, you will have
to take down that flag."
' I am the American Consul," said
M<i\,,,k. "Why should I take down
the Hag?"
"Because I am the Customs Inspector
for this Government, and I am not go
ing to do business in a building where
that flag is flying. I never did do that
and I never will. That flag must come
down, unless the Union Jack flies above
it."
"The Consul's office is American ter
ritory," answered McCook. "An English
flag never yet floated above the stars
strip s on American territory and
it never will if I can prevent It."
"I will report the matter to my GovÂ»
eminent," said Davis, hotly, "and I
will have you removed from office."
"Your Government or that of Great
Britain cannot havt me removed. No
b idy can do that but the President of
the United States," sMd McCook. "The
flag will remain wherever I have my
office. Inasmuch, ho vever, as you
have some prior rights there, I will en
deavor to find another location for my
office a? soon as possible"
General McCook moved ihe next day
and now has independent offices in an
equally central location on Front street,
and with that and a report of it to
hington the incident ended, al
gh Prosecuting Attorney Wade
and other Canadian officials hfcve since
taken occasion to assure McCcok that
t>p.vlÂ« "did not mean what he said."
Tho other incident was tho ar.-est of
one Arthur Perry by Canadian officials
in American territory. Arthur jerry
had charge of what Is known as the
claim on French El Dorado.
At the end of the clean-up instead of
turning the $14,000 that resulted o\er
to Alex. McDonald, owner of the mire,
Perry took passage with it on board
the littlf steamer Governor Stoneman
for St. Michael. Perry's wife was a.\
the time on her way to Dawson up the
river. They me t and she returned
down stream with him, but one of her
trunks came on to Dawson. This gave
the Canadian police a clew as to Per
ry's whereabouts and an officer took
passage on the Columbia Navigation
Company's Bteamer Monarch, which
overhauled the Stoneman below the
Koyukuk. They found Perry and wife
and the polo 1 . Some protest Mas made
by the passengers against the arrest
being made in American territory with
out requisition papers, but Captain
Sprague of the Monarch declared that
he would support the officers â if Perry
was a thief he ought to be arrested.
â  He had been assured that a reciprocal
arrangement had been effected cover
ing such matters between Captain Ray,
representing the United States, when
that officer passed through Dawson in
: the spring and Captain Constantine, in
; command of the Northwest mounted
: police. When the Monarch met the
Columbia, the latter going up stream,
i the prisoner and officer transferred to
, her. The prisoner was not only
! shackled, but chained to his bed and
; was not allowed to see any one but his
wife and she but a few moments during
: the day. This treatment made it easy
'â  for the wife to quicken sympathy
! among the passengers. The Columbian
: found the steamer Rock Island No. 1
i on a sand bar in the Yukon flats and
undertook to help her off. The story
of the prisoner was communicated to
the passengers on that boat in the
I meanwhile. Among them was United
States Custom Collector Ivey, located
at Eagle City. The Rock Island got off
the bar and the Columbian got on and
remained on for one day, the Rock
Island proceeding on her way with
Ivey and Perry's wife on board. When
the* Columbian touched at Eagle City
Ivey went aboard and, supported by
il other men, demanded the re
1< ase of the prisoner, declaring that
unless released he would take him by
force and a threat was made that the
boat would not be cleared with the
prisoner on board. At the end of it
all the shackles were not only removed
and Perry allowed to go free, but the
big sack of gold which had been taken
away from him was returned, Ivey
giving a receipt for it. The officer came
on to Dawson and goes back to-morrow
on the Columbian, taking with him
papers secured from Consul General
McCook, under which he expects to
not only rearrest Perry, but bring Ivey
to Dawson also and the gold. Prosecut
ing Attorney Wade goes down with
him. The outcome of the matter can
scarcely be guessed at. Captain Foster
of the Columbian says that Perry was
disposed to send the money back with
the officer, the consideration being that
he himself be allowed to go and that
the officer would have consented to this,
but that Perry was influenced finally
not to do so.
To get requisition papers from Sitka
is a matter of months that may rur.
into years. It is so clearly impractica
ble to attempt it that it has long been
the custom for officers of the two gov.
ernments to run over the line either
way in chasing criminals, but old cus-.
Toms are rapidly passing on the Yukon.
Joe Pickup, a discouraged minei,
r-amping with A. A. Turnbarge and J.
Leigh ton on the water front, blew out
3is brains in his tent on the 17th.
The little steamer Joseph Clossett.
tvhich was wrecked two weeks ago in
Miles Canyon, arrived yesterday.
The rush "out" is now gathering
Kreat momentum. The rate for third
class on the down-river steamers of the
old lines to Puge-t Sound points is $100,
and the great majority are taking ad
vantage of that rate. The rate up
river is Jl2O to Lake Bennett, which
means about $200 to Puget Sound. O n
most of the boats going that way pas
sengers must find their own provis
ions. Brg barges preparing to float
down the river are taking passengers
at $10 each, they finding their own
blankets and provisions. A mosquito
boat, the Vivian, will start down the
river in a few days with two barges in
tow, the passenger fare upon which
will be $30. These doubtful enterprises
will be well patronized. All boats leav
ing here for both up and down the river
carry a full quota of passengers and
still the crowd upon the streets seems
to remain the same. Building both of
cabins and business places, the latter
being now made of such substantial
stuff as is required by the winter, con
tinues at a tremendous pace. The sum
mer conditions are all being rapidly
changed to meet the ice. But still the
great number of tents that whiten the
whole margin of the city is fixed as In
early July.
NAVIGATION NOW CLOSED.
So Klondikers Will Have to Take the
Overland Trail.
VANCOUVER., B. C. Oct. 10.âRepre
sentative Mason, who has just arrived
from Dawson, reports that navigation on
the Yukon is now closed. The last steam
er to leave for St. Michael was the Sarah.
The steamer James Domvllle went
aground near Rink Rapids and the steam
er Clara is aground in a slough close to
Indian River. Both steamers were com
ing up the Yukon.

ANTHRAX APPEARS
IN VIRULENT FORM
Depleting Herds in the
Vicinity of Gait.
BROUGHT BY MAVERICK COWS
VETERINARY SURGEON MAKES
AN INVESTIGATION.
Finds Cattle Dropping Dead From the
Malady Whose Nature Their
Owners I?id Not
Suspect,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 10.â Dr. D. P.
Fox, the official county veterinary sur
geon, this afternoon brought the alarm
ing intelligence that within three or four
miles of Gait, at the southeastern cor
ner of the county, anthrax has ap
peared in the most virulent form among
dairy cows.
A couple of weeks ago two strange
cows wandered to that section from
some locality not yet ascertained. They
remained a few days and died. Im
mediately thereafter Sol Kreeger began
losing one cow after another, the ani
mals taking sick and dying despite his
efforts to check the malady, whose true
nature he did not suspect. When the
people of the vicinity read about the
appearance of anthrax elsewhere they
decided to notify the county veterinar
ian. Dr. Fox immediately repaired to
the scene, returning this afternoon. To
The Call correspondent he said:
"I found the conditions very bad in
deed. During the past ten days twelve
of Kreeger's cows have dropped at dif
ferent points on his ranch, and when I
reached there I located them by the
buzzards that were circling about their
still unburied carcasses.
"A cursory examination sufficed to
convince me that the cattle had died
from anthrax. I found a milch cow
which had symptoms of the disease
and immediately killed it. Holding an
autopsical examination while the body
was still warm, I found the spleen,
liver and kidneys covered with the
characteristic lesions of anthrax in its
worst form. Before I could burn all
the bodies I found some hogs which had
strayed in, attacking the remains of
one of the dead cows. I immediately
quarantined those hogs and all of
Kreeger's cattle.
"The disease can easily be communi
cated to human beings through contact

ANTHRAX NOT EPIDEMIC
IN MARIN COUNTY
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 10.â There is
great indignation in Marin County
over the report that the dis
ease known as anthrax was
prevalent among the cattle of
the county. The dairy interests of
Marin are among the most extensive In
the State and such misrepresentation
cannot fail to inflict great injury. The
whole of this afternoon's session of the
Board of Supervisors was given over to
an investigation. The evidence shows
conclusively that the anthrax exists
wholly in the imagination of a yellow
journal correspondent.
Dr. W. F. Jones, the County Health
Officer, stated that he had examined
the cattle at Larkspur and Reeds Sta
tion, where anthrax was claimed to
have prevailed and found not a trace
of it. Dr. Neif, the County Veterinary-
Surgeon, made a similar statement. As
regards the two men examined by Dr.
Bazet in San Francisco, one of them
told a local physician he was stung by
an insect and the other had blood poi
soning consequent upon foreign matter
Retting into a cut on the hand.
The unjust statement that in the last
year herds of infected cattle had been
herds of infected cattle had been
brought into the county was strongly
denied by R. T. Hatch of Novato.
"Only 110 head of cattle have been
brought into the county since last
May," said Hatch. "They were all ex
amined by a competent veterinary sur
geon, and, without a single exception,
found to be healthy."
It is believed that the five cattle that
died at Reeds Station were afflicted
with pulmonary tuberculosis. In order
to prevent the introduction and spread
of any disease in the future, the board
adopted an ordinance providing that
before any milch cows or other horned
stock be Imported a certificate of
health must be presented to the County
Health Officer, signed by a regular
graduate of a veterinary college, who
shall have practiced his profession not
less than two years. The District At
torney was called upon by resolution
to enforce the provisions of the ordi
nance, and its violation will be a mis
demeanor offense.
SOLANO SUPERVISORS
ADOPT PRECAUTIONS
SUISUN, Oct. 10.â At a special meet
ing of the Board of Supervisors to-day
the sum of $400 was allowed to provide
for the collection of expert testimony
regarding the fatalities among cattle
in Solano County and to provide for
expert examination of all cattle in the
county. Stockmen intended to submit
an ordinance before the board for the
protection of their interests. It was de
< idÂ«'d, however, to defer this to obtain
all possible information. When this
shall have been accomplished an or
dinance will be presented for the Su
pervisors' consideration.
Killed by an Ore Car.
REDDING, Oct. 10.â Martin Price, a
miner employed at the Iron Mountain,
mine, was run over and instantly killnl
by a trolley ore %ar this morning. He
was in tunnel No. 2, and, considering
himself on the safe track, paid no at
tention to the approaching car until too
late.
Passing of an Argonaut.
SALINAS, Oct. 10.â B. F. Reynolds, a
pioneer, died at the County Hospital this
afternoon, in his seventy-eighth year. He
came to the State in the early fifties, and
engaged in mining. He removed to
Salinas in ISG6, and was engaged in busi
ness until a few years aj,'o, when, becom
ing an invalid, he entered the County
Hospital.
Train-Wrecker's Peculiar Plea.
SANTA ROSA, Oct. 10.â II. C. Griffin,

when arrested at Vallejo, and repeated
the confession here. This plea to-day
caused surprise. He will be tried on No

WRECKING SAN
JOSE'S SCHOOLS
Boss Rule Stirs Up New
Difficulties.
TROUBLE IN THE LOWELL
AUTOCRATIC MISS PECKHAM
THE DISTURBER.
Principal Causes the Transfer of
Teachers Whose Advance
ment Arouses Her
Envy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 10.â There is another
revolt in the San Jose School Depart
ment. This time the scene of trouble
is the Lowell Grammar School, and the
chief actor about whom the storm of
fury centers is Miss Lois Peckham, the
principal. For some time her tyran
nical and czarlike rulings have aroused
ill feeling among the teachers, and
some have even left the school rather
than suffer abuse. It has been neces
sary to transfer teachers from the
school in order to have harmony, and
those to whom the principal took a dis
like and who had no political pull have
either resigned their position or been
"classified out" by the classification
committee. Miss Peckham has the
support of Rea, and what she says in
school affairs goes, and even the mem
bers of the Board of Education have to
respect her wishes.
This was clearly shown the first of
last week. At that time there was se
rious trouble in the school and for a
while it looked as though the dozen
teachers there would go on a strike for
the removal of Miss Peckham rrom the
principalship. These sentiments were
freely expressed by the schoolmarms
and it was necessary to call in mem
bers of the School Board to pacify
them. As it was Miss Peckham and
Miss Charlotte Brower of the seventh
grade nearly got into a hair-pulling
contest and only the manly form of the
janitor prevented a physical encounter.
The outcome of this was that Miss
Peckham told the Trustees that they
must transfer Miss Brower to another
school or she would Ignore their au
thority and go straight to Rea. The
Trustees took her orders as if they
came direct from the "boss," and Miss
Brower was transferred 10 the Lincoln
Grammar School.
The story of last week's trouble is
this: Miss Ida M. Love, vice princi
pal of the school and teacher of the
eighth grade, was removed with her
class to the new High School. The
classes of this grade from the different
schools have been located in the High
School to help fill the vacancy made by
the striking High School pupils who
have gone to the Santa Clara High
School. The removal of this class
from the Lowell made Miss Brower of
the seventh grade vice principal. Miss
Peckham objected and started in to
drive Miss Brower from the school by
making It unpleasant for her. The
other teachers took Miss Hrower's part
and then trouble was on in earnest.
In order to restore quiet the classifi
cation committee â composed of Trus
tees Graham and Kenyon â transferred
Miss Brower to the Lincoln School and
gave Miss Nellie O'Brien of the Lowell
the vice principalship. Miss Eliza
Higgins of the Lincoln was put in Miss
O'Brien's place in the sixth grade. This
has patched up the matter for a while,
but it is .said the trouble is not ended.
San Jose's School Department is
gaining an unenviable reputation. Dif
ficulty after difficulty has arisen and
the people are beginning to ask where
all this quarreling will end. Politics
is the cause of it all, and unless checked
the methods of Rea and the Macken
zies will lÂ»e the ruination of the schools.
The new High School has been almost
wrecked and now the grammar schools
are threatened.
The City Board of Education is really
to blame. Instead of conducting the
schools for the best interests of the tax
payers they are using the positions In
the department to strengthen their
"gang" politically.
Trustees O'Neill and Wemple are In
clined to do what is right, but they
are powerless to act with Langford,
Graham and Kenyon opposed to them.
When Langford was appointed a Trus
tee by Mayor Martin people believed
he would act for the best interests of
the city; Instead he sold out to Rea
for the nomination for Sheriff. His
record for the few months he has been
on the School Board shows how thor
oughly "gang" he is, and if placed In
the Sheriff's office he would be even
more neglectful of the people's inter
ests. His vote was needed on the
School Board, and as he wanted to be
Sheriff the "gang" made the bargain
with him. It was his decisive vote that
removed Professor Smith from the
High School and Mrs. A. ---. Clement
from the City Superintendent's office.
He also was instrumental in creating
the office of Supervisor of Kindergar
tens for Miss Belle Mackenzie.
KNIGHT OF THE ROAD
HALTS TWO TRAVELERS
Lone Highwayman Collects Toll in
the Northern Part of Marin
County.
SAN RAFAEL. Oct. 10.â For the ppo
ond time within a month comes the news
of a daring hold-up in the northern part
of Marin County. At about 4 o'clock
yesterday afternoon a Portuguese named
Manuel Homen and a companion were
stood up by a lone highwayman by a
point nine miles from Point Reyes sta
tion. The robber presented a revolver
and ordered the men to turn their pock
etS Inside out. They did as ordered, and
were permitted to drive on, without hav
ing to dismount from the wagon in which
they rode. The knight of the road ob
tained only a small sum in cash, and did
not seem to care for the jewelry the men
The victims describe the highwayman
as being about 5 feet 8 Inches in height.
He had a light mustache and wore a
hunting coat, with a light striped sweat
er and dark pantaloons. His features
wore concealed by a black mask and the
shadow cast by a dark slouch hat. The
robber was last seen east of Point Reyes,
whore the road strikes 1 omalos Bay. Sev
eral other persons were passed by him,
but he made no attempt to rob anybody
Sheriff Harrison was notified of the
hold-up to-night, and will leave for the
scene, early in the morning. It is be
lieved that the robber is the same person
who robbed a dairyman near Point Reyes
about a monthjago.
Death of a Sonoma Pioneer.
SONOMA. Oct. 10.â Caleb C. Carreger,
a pioneer of this valley, died of cancer
at his home last night. Mr. Carriger
came to Sonoma in 1846 and settled on a
farm on the west side of the valley. He
owned one of the finest orange and lemon
groves in this part of the county, from
which he shipped large consignments to
the San Francisco market. Mr. Carrlger
was born in Carter County Tennessee, in
1532. He leaves a widow and four chil
dren. The funeral will take place to
morrow.
COLONEL HALE
NOILS A YELLOW
JOURNAL FAKE
First Colorado's Commarjder
Denounces Articles Reflecting
Upon His Subordinates.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST REGIMENT COLORADO INFANTRY.
UNITED STATES VOLUNTEERS,
SAN SEBASTIAN, Manila, August 31.
I have just been shown clippings from the San Francisco Exam
iner of July 8 and 17, containing articles concerning behavior of troops
of second expedition at Honolulu and alleged selling of Red Cross
supplies and donated tobacco, which are so absolutely faJse as to re
quire positive contradiction, even at this late date.
The fictitious nature of the article of July 17 is perhaps sufficiently
Indicated by the fact that It quotes numerous letters said to have
been written by our soldiers from Manila, whereas we did not ar
rive in Manila Bay until July 16. These letters must have been sent
by the process of thought transference, as the cable was cut.
There was some trouble about rations and messing arrangements
due to the loading of some of the company rations in the hold, where
they were Inaccessible, the insufficient capacity of the steam pipe to
the new range installed for use of the Colorado Regiment, the unfa
miliarity of the cooks with their new surroundings, etc.; but these
difficulties were promtply and thoroughly investigated and remedied as
rapidly as possible.
There is absolutely no foundation for the rumor that supplies do
nated by the Red Cross Society or others were sold. It may have
originated from similar articles being sold by the commissary, ship's
crew or others. All donated articles were distributed with the great
est care and fairness.
The statement about objectionable conduct of the troops of the
second expedition at Honolulu is a malicious slander. Their behavior
was remarkably good, so much so as to evoke the unanimous and
unstinted praise of the people of Honolulu, who said that while the
first expedition behaved well, the second was even better.
The enviable reputation which the Colorado Regiment earned in
San Francisco for discipline and general good conduct was more than
sustained In Honolulu, and we decidedly object to having it
smirched by any irresponsible and mendacious correspondent. This
feeling Is doubtless shared by the other organizations comprising
the second expedition, all of which conducted themselves in a most
praiseworthy manner. IRVING HALE,
Colonel First Regiment Colorado Infantry, U. S. V.
EXTENDING THE SCOPE OF
THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH
Memorial From the Japanese Diocese
Urging the Creation of a New
Jurisdiction.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.â At to-day s
session of the Triennial Conference of the
Episcopal Church, the expanding In
fluence of the church was indicated by
the memorial from the Japanese diocese,
urging the greation of a southern juris
diction in that country and from the
Anglican church in Honolulu, heretofore
fostered by the English church, asking
that, in view of the annexation of Hawaii
to the United States, the church of
Hawaii be amalgamated with that In this
country, becoming a missionary jurisdic
tion. The propositions were referred.
A resolution was adopted for the ap
pointment of a committee of five deputies
to meet with a committee of bishops to
select the city for the next place of meet-
Ing The chair named as the committee
of deputies Messrs. Morgan of New York,
Spalding of California, Mann of Missouri,
Lindsay of Massachusetts and Waters of
Louisiana.
The main discussion of the day was
on the amendment to the constitution.
The article governing the formation of
new dioceses was amended so as to per
mit the diocese of New York and Brook
lyn to be divided.
"The Bishops appointed the following
members of the joint committee on selec
tion of a city in which to hold the conven
tion of 1901: Messrs. Potter of New York.
Randolph of Virginia. "Worthlngton of
Nebraska. Lawrence of Massachusetts
and Morrison of Duluth.
An invitation was received from San
Francisco to hold the next convention
there.
It was decided to create a new mission
ary district In Japan to be known as the
Kyoto district, which is co-terminus with
the Japanese diocese. The missionary will
be selected by the Bishops.
The chairman on behalf of the presiding
Bishops announced the appointment of
twenty commissioners of the American
Church Building Fund, including the fol
lowing: Rev. Morgan Dix. New York;
Rev. Douglass O. Kelly, California and
Hon. N. L. Bradford Prince, New Mexico.
The Bishops considered the proposed
now canon relating to the question of
marriage and divorce for the balance of
the day. Secretary Hart announced that
considerable progress had been made, but
no decision was reached.

MRS. GEORGE ARRAIGNED
IN A CANTON COURT
Pleads Not Guilty to the Charge of
Having Murdered George D.
Saxton.
CANTON. Ohio, Oct. 10.â Anna E.
George, charged with the murder of
George E. Saxton. was taken into Jus
tice Reigner's courtroom to-day to enter
her plea to the affidavit charging her with
murder. Long before the hour the court
room was filled with men and women, all
anxious to see Mrs. George. She looked
unconcerned and seemingly did not realize
the momentous question which she was
to make answer to in court. The eyes of
everybody in the courtroom were upon
her aa she gazed about the room.
Justice Reigner asked Mrs. George if
she was guilty or not guilty to the charge
made against her in the affidavit. Mrs.
George, seemingly not disturbed in the
least but in a very weak and srarcely
audible voice, answered, "Not guilty."
Tuesday afternoon at 1 o"clock was set
for the hearing. Mrs. George was then
taken back to the County Jail.
The funeral services over the remains
of George D. Saxton, held at the M. C.
Barber residence this afternoon, were very
short and simple. When the services were
over the members of the family took th>>ir
places in the carriages. In the first were
President and Mrs. MoKinley and Mr. and
Mrs. M. C. Barber. Other relatives and
near friends, including Webb C. Hayes,
following, in other carriages.
Many people gathered about the Bar
ber residence and all along the route
which was taken by the funeral cortege

mains were consigned to their last rest

SANTIAGO DE CITTSA, Oct. 10.âGen
eral Lawtpn, whose illness has lasted
more than ten days, came to town this
afternoon for the first time. He will sail
on Tuesday on the transport Michigan,
accompanied by his personal staff. His
leave of absence is nominally three

By special order from the War Depart

assigned to the command of the Depart

an acting appointment at present, but
there is every reason to believe it will
be permanent. He will probably be
raised to the rank of major-general and
continue in command of Santiago dis

CLOSE FINISHES
AT LOS ANGELES
Only One Favorite Meets
Defeat.
WILLIAM OB BEATS NAPIAN
LADY ASHLEY NOSED OUT BY
ROADWARMER.
Bullman Attempts to Draw a Garri
son Finish and Is Caught Nap
ping at the Post by
Tommy Butler.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
I;OS ANGELES. Oct. 10.â The opening
day of the week saw only a small crowd
In attendance to view the racing at the
park, ani there was a tk-arth of coin in
the ring, making It difficult for the book
makers on the dead line to round up. The
racinp wae characterized by nothing of
a startling nature. The 2:12 trot was
red in by Prince Gift after three
tame heats had been stepped. In the re
maining events William 08, Reina de
Los Angeles and Roadwarmer, all
staunchly supported choices, came home
in front, but in third dash for two-year
olds Obsidian, the Burns & Waterhouse
disappointment, upset the calculations of
the talent by winning all the way, start
ing at odds of 7 to 2.
For the 2:12 trot five scored up for the ,
word, with the field, consisting of Silver '
Ring, Galetta, Osito and Our Jack, bring- i
Ing 9 against 10 for Prince Gift. The *atter '
never left the result in doubt, winning in I
three straight heats. Time 2:12%, 2:14*4 |
and 2:13. Galena did not trot up to ex- i
pectations, but managed to finish second j
in two heats, taking second money.
Tho seven-furlong purse affair proved
quite a betting race. Napian, the two- i
year-old, with Devin in the saddle, opened j
a strong favorite, but the educated coin '
was dropped in at the last minute by the
left-hand bettors on William 08, and it
was even money and take your pick at ;
post time. Devln was carried wide at j
the head of tho stretch by Shields on 'â 
Petrarch, and Frawley, saving a good !
deal of ground by making a short cut on
William 08, led the Burns & Water
house candidate out by the shortest sort
of a head.
The Baldwin entry, Reina de Los An
geles, led the maiden class in the flve
furlong scramble following. She ruled fa
vorite in the ring at the short price of 6
to 5, and at the wire, excellently ridden
by young Devin, defeated Castelar, the
second choice, with apparent ease. The
other starters were a misfit lot.
It looks as though Ocorona has lost her
winning form. The filly was sent out a !
9 to 10 favorite for the fourth number on
the card and Shields was unable to land
her among the first three. Obsidian,
piloted by Jos Piggott, made all the run
ning and won handily from Los Mndanos,
the Baldwin entry. San Augustine fin
ished in the show.
Through a stupid piece of saddle work
on the part of Bullman, the speedy Road
warmer was able to win the final purse.
In a four and a half furlong run Bullman
eat perfectly still on Lady Ashley and in
the finest drawn finish of the meeting was
beaten by a no^e. Roodwarmer was han
dled with raro skill by Tommy Butler
and closed an odds-on favorite In the bet
ting. When riders of Bullman's caliber
attempt to draw Garrison finishes they
should be given a vacation. Summary:

MATRIMONIAL AGENCY
DUPE DIES IN WANT
ALEXANDER S. SAMPSON THE
LUCKLESS VICTIM.
He Became Destitute and Was Sent
by the Police to the City
and County Hos
pital.
Alexander S. Sampson, one of the vic
tims of Bain's matrimonial agency, died
at the City and County â¢Hospital yester
day afternoon and his death 13 attributed
in a large measure to the worry and feel
ing of shame at his failure to marry the
"rich widow."
Bampson was a man about 63 years of
ago and lived in West Duxbury. Muss.
He saw the advertisement of the "rich
widow" wanting a husband in Bain's pa
per and started a correspondence with
.Mrs. Grace Allison. She lnducf-d him to
come to the city and he arrived about
two months ago. He borrowed $100 on a
small niece of property he owned and had
?25 left on his arrival here. He called
upon Mrs. Allison, but when Bhe learned
that he was a poor man she would have
nothing to do with him.
His money was soon ppent and he tried
to obtain employment but was not suc
cessful. He disliked to write home to hln
friends for assistance and in his despera
tion called at police headquarters -and
was turned over to Sergeant Moffltt. The
sergeant took him to the City Prison,
where Mrs. Allison was at that time de
tained, and he at once Identified her as
the woman who had allured him here.
She denied ever seeing him before and
flippantly remarked to other women who
were In the cell: "Girls, what would I
want with an old guy like that?" Samp
son had sent her $5 to get her photograph
taken but he had never received one, and
his case was one of the strongest against
her and Ealn for using the mails for ille
gal purposes.
Sergeant Moffltt learned last week that
the old man was destitute and he pro
cured a room for him and bought him a
number of meal tickets so that he would
not starve. He became so weak Saturday
that he was removed to the City and
County Hospital, where he died yesterday
afternoon. â¢
He had evidently swallowed his pride
and written to his friends, for money in
a registered letter from "Mrs. Eleanor Ma
goun. Myrtle street, East Pembroke,
Mass.," reached the general postoffice for
him yesterday morning. Chief Lees noti
fied the postal authorities to hold the lat
ter till he communicated with the old
man's friends as to It and the disposition
ot the body.

Magnitude of the Demonstration Evidence That
Kern County Is Lost to the Single-
Tax Apostle.
BAKERSFIELD, Oct. 10.â Henry T. |
Gage, Republican nominee for Gover- ;
nor, to-day bepran his tour of the great
Ban Joaquin Valley, invading the field
which the Magruireites claim as their j
Btrong-hold. The standard bearer of the
Republican legions, accompanied by
Hon. E. F. Preston, arrived in Bakers-
field at T o'clock this morning. The I
party was received at the railroad sta
tion by Chairman A. C. Maude and
Secretary S. N. Reed of the Republican
County Central Committee and es
corted to tho Southern Hotel.
An informal reception to afford the j
people an opportunity to grasp the
hand of Mr. Gage was held at the
Southern Hotel this afternoon. This
event was announced by an artillery sa
lute. While the people were coming
and going Professor Alvord's band
played patriotic airs. Populists and
Democrats Joined the Republicans in
greeting the popular leader.
During the past two weeks there has
been a marked change of public senti
ment in Kern County and the change is
in favor of Henry T. Gage. This fact
Is readily admitted by Democrats and
Populists. Republicans may be over
confident when they assert that Kern
County, which gave Bryan 400, will next
November return a majority for Gage
and Neff, but they base their estimates
on oral and written declarations of
Democrats and middle-of-the-road
Populists.
A leading Populist of Tehachapl,
writing to "W. R. Crawford, regular
Populist nominee for Assemblyman,
says the Kern County district is greatly
Incensed over the decision of the court
which excludes the regular Populists
from a place on the ticket. He ad
vises his party friends to shun Ma
guire and support Gage. Old-time
Democrats, and particularly the ex-
Confederates, of whom there are many
In Kern County, scorn Maguire for his
unpatriotic attitude In Congress to
ward the American soldiers.
By 7 o'clock an assemblage numbering
more than 3000 people surrounded the
beautifully decorated rostrum on Ches
ter avenue. The managers of the meet
ing, judging by the demand of the Ma
guire turnout, had provided seats for
1000. When the multitude gathered to
hear Gage and Preston grew to 3000 or
more all doubt as to the position of
Kern County in this battle vanquished.
It was noted as a significant fact that
the vast audience remained until the
close of the speeches.
The people were called to order by A.
C. Maude, chairman of the County
Central Committee. He introduced as
president of the meeting Hon. W. H.
Scribner. The president simply ac
knowledged the compliment bestowed,
and announced the following vice
presidents:
Sol. Jewett, Wellington Canfield, Rich
ard Hudnut, F. A. Tracey, John Barker,
D. G. McLean, X W. Craig, Wilmot
Lowell, Charles Ankrum, L. P. St. Clalr,
James L. Depauli, P. W. Bennett, C. H.
Emery, Walter James, Andrew Brown,
John M. Keith, D. M. Pyle, J. S. Ellis,
J. W. Wiley, J. R. Withrow, Max Nunez,
E. Dinkelspiel, C. E. Arnold, R. Fris
selle, C. Wirth, C. J. E. Taylor, D. S.
Cioverdale, C. L. Conner, Dave HJrah
fleld, Andre Valenzule.
J. C. Needham was the fh^st speaker
introduced. He delivered an excellent
address, full of good points, and gained
the favor of the throng.
The introduction of Henry T. Gage as
"the next Governor of California by
10,000 majority" was the signal for a
mighty shout and prolonged demon
strations of welcome. Mr. Gage spoke
for one hour and twenty minutes, and
maintained the undivided attention of
the audience throughout the discourse.
.The throng to a man remained until
the finish of his speech. His voice did
not fail him for an instant, and he
could be heard distinctly by the people
who were crowded on the balcony of
the Arlington Hotel, and others who
stood a half block distant from the
speaker's stand.
His speech to-night was In many re
spects his best effort of the campaign.
It was a masterly review of the vital
Issues of the day. He demonstrated to
the Jeffersonian Democrats that they
had no ticket to vote except one on the
line of the Republican principles. He
submitted to the Populists that they
had been betrayed by the party of con
fusion. He contended that a vote for
the Maeuire confusionists was a vote
for dishonest money, free trade, finan
cial ruin and single tax.
Mr. Gage fully elucidated the single
tax proposition as applied to the mines
and scored a great success in this line.
In closing the standard-bearer promised
that if elected Governor he would give
the people of the State a clean, honest
and businesslike administration. The
effective pointsâ and there were manyâ
in Mr. Gage's address were applauded.
Frank Short of Fresno was intro
duced, but it was obvious that the cam
paign had so used up his voice that he
could not speak without great effort. He
excused himself, therefore, from say-
Ing more than a word of thanks for the
honor of being presented to the mag
nificent audience.
The Introduction of Hon. E. F. Pres
ton was the signal for another great
demonstration. He recalled some inci
dents of an address delivered here in
honor of the extension of the Valley
road to this city. He remarked that the
Valley road was not in politics, and in
cidentally referred to the absurd ru
mor that the road had sold . out to the
monopoly. He called the attention of
his hearers to the circulation of this
rumor at a time when the surveyors
â were in Tejon Pass and when men were
speeding across the Atlantic to estab

EATON FOR MAYOR
OF LOS ANGELES
Republicans Name Him
by Acclamation.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
LOS ANGELES.Oct. 10.â The Repub
licans of Los Angeles City to-day gave
evidence of their enthusiasm for Gage
and the Republican State ticket. The
convention with its 417 delegates was
convened at Hazard's Pavilion at 11
o'clock in the forenoon. The commit
tee on platform made an extended re
port, commending the Seventh Regi
ment for its heroic self sacrifice in the
cause of humanity. On the water ques
tion the platform reads as follows:
Resolved, That we are in favor of mu
nicipal ownership of a complete domes
tic water system which will supply to
every inhabitant and every interest with
in the limits of the city an ample
and cheap supply of pure water without
the annoyance of petty regulations and
exactions prescribed by the existing com
panies.
And we further declare that we are un
alterably opposed to a renewal of the
lease of the Los Angeles Water Company,
or to granting said corporation, or any
other corporation, firm or person whatso
ever, any privilege of franchise for the
sale or distribution of water in and for
said city of Los Angeles.
We pledge the nominees of the Repub
lican party, in this convention named, to
proceed at once to provide an adequate
nigh-level gravity supply of water from
Los Angeles River; to construct necessary
conduits and reservoirs for the convey
ance and storage of the same; to lay the
necesary mains and supply pipes of ade
quate capacity for the distribution of a
liberal supply of water where no service
now exists and to lay mains of suffi
cient size throughout the present distrib
uting system of the city where under
sized mains are now made to perform
very unsatisfactory service.
William J. Hunsacker made his Ini
tial appearance before the Republican
convention by placing Fred Eaton in
nomination for Mayor. Mr. Hunsacker
Is a gold Democrat. Eaton^s nomina
tion was made by acclamation amid
tremendous applause.

and among the vice-presidents were many
Stanford professors. The Stanford Uni

marched to the hall headed by the Uni
versity band.
Professor Brun in a forcible speech ex
plained why he was a Republican and his
manner of conducting the meeting proved
that he is thoroughly alive to the Issues
of the campaign. The professor intro
duced Congressman Loud, who was re
ceived with enthusiastic applause. Mr.
Loud Bpoke in his usual forcible manner
for an hour and the closest attention was
given him by the audience, whose fre
quent applause demonstrated that his ar
guments were well received.
Mr Bailey, president of the Gage Re
publican Club of Stanford, was then
called for and introduced. In his remarks
he took occasion to refer to the state
ment published In the Examiner to the

JOSEPH KELLY
DENOUNCES
JIM BARRY
Charged With Polit
ical Chicanery.
PAST RECORD OF BAD FAITH
AN OLD GRUDGE THAT NOW
SEEKS SATISFACTION.
A Warm. Opening Speech Delivered
by the IVian Who Is Running
as an Independent Can
didate.
Joseph P. Kelly, Independent Demo
cratic candidate for Congress from the
Fourth District, made his initial cam
paign address last night before the In
dependent Democratic Club in Harmony-
Hall on Jackson street, near East. Near
ly 500 sailors and residents of the district
listened to Mr. Kelly and cheered his
efforts. He was Introduced by Chair
man John Maloney and spoke for nearly
an hour.
Mr. Kelly explained his reason for en
tering the present campaign as an inde
pendent candidate against James H.
Barry and Julius Kahn, the Republican
nominee, in the following words: "I have
been a candidate in the Fifth Congres
sional District as the regular Democratic
nominee and would not have been a can
didate in the Fourth District had it not
been for the fact that Mr. Barry, the so
called regular Democratic nominee, was
an aspirant for the office in that district.
"The reason why I speak of Mr. Barry
as being the so-called regular Demo
cratic nominee in the Fourth District is
because he has never been a Democrat
and never was entitled to Democratic
support. He twice defeated ex-Judge
Ferral for Congress by putting in the
field and supporting an independent can
didate, with the result that Hon. W. W.
Morrow was elected once, and John T.
Cutting at another time. Another rea
son why he does not deserve his party's
support is that when the late Hon. Frank
McCoppin, ex-Mayor and ex-postmaster
of this city, was nominated for Congress
in the Fourth District Mr. Barry brought
Charles A. Sumner from Stockton and
placed him in the right as an Independent
candidate. Had Mr. Sumner not been a
candidate Mr. McCoppin would have been
elected by a plurality of 800 votes.
"Four years ago Mr. Barry spoiled
things in the Fifth Congressional District |
by supporting the candidacy of James
Denman, one of the committee of one
hundred job chasers, which showed that
Mr. Barry was again a tool in behalf of
the railroad and the Republican party by
advocating Denman and electing Eugene
F Loud. Again, two years ago, at Ked
wood City, on the 20th day of July, Mr.
Barry Mr. Clunie and myself were can
didates for the nomination of Congress
man from the *ifth Congressional Dis.
trict After we were placed in nomina
tion we were called before the conven
tion to express our views. Each of us
pledged himself to support the nominee
of the convention, whoever he might be.
The nomination was awarded to me, but i
Mr. Barry proved false to his promise. |
He' endeavored to secure the nomination I
at the hands of the so-called fusion com
mittee, but was beaten by one vote. The
fusion convention gave the nomination to
a man who never denied and under his
own signature admitted that he was a j
member of the American Protective As-
sociation. ,
"In violation of his promise which he
made before the convention he espoused
the cause of this A. P. A., Kinney, as
against the nominee he previously prom
ised to support.
"Mr. Barry has made repeated asser
tions in his paper that he was opposed
to the American Protective Association.
I regret that that issue was ever brought
into the fight, notwithstanding that I
respect a man who has regard for prin
ciple, but I do not respect a hypocrite.
1 have been reliably informed and will
prove that in ISB6, or thereabouts, an or
der was formed here called the Patriotic
Sons of America, the object of which wa*
to prevent Catholics becoming members
of the Board of Education, and at that
time Mr. Barry was a member of one of
the councils thereof."
Mr. Kelly then discussed national la
sues. He said the railroad was an issue
in the present campaign. He dwelt at
some length on the funding bill and told
why true and tried public servants J
should be elected to fill the high office j
to combat Its passage. He said he was j
in favor of territorial expansion and the I
Nicaragua canal. Mr. Kelly won the
sailors by assuring them, if elected, he
would do all In his power to ameliorate
their condition. At the conclusion of hia
speech he was greeted with hearty ap
plause.
THE SLATE NOT READY.
Boss Phelan Will To-Day Name His
Campaign Committee.
The Phelan Committee of One Hun- i
dred Job Chasers, who have taken upon i
themselves the management of the local
Democracy, met last night In Native
Sons' building, but owing to the neglect
of the boss to arrange a programme no j
business could be transacted. Chairman
McDonald was absent, and Secretary
Walsh called the few members present
to order. He announced that it would
be first In order to elect a temporary
chairman.
Max Popper nominated P. H. McCarthy
and he was elected. Inasmuch as there
was not a quoruro present the secretary ;
did not call the roll.
"We are now ready for business," said
Chairman McCarthy.
"I move that the chair be instructed to j
appoint a campaign committee to con- !
slst of one member from each of the \
eighteen Assembly districts," chirruped ;
Charlie Fay, who handles Boss Phelans i
programme.
"Are the members to be chosen from
this body or selected at large?" inquired
Clitus Barbour.
"From this General Committee," an
swered Fay.
"I understand," ventured Barbour,
"that we can't find any one not a candi
date."
"Bosh!" exclaimed M. C. Hassett
Chairman McCarthy announced that it
would require time to make the select
tlons, so Dr. Beverly Cole kindly moved
that he be given all the time he required
to pick out a good committee.
As there was nothing else to do, the
Job chasers adjourned.
Chairman McCarthy will announce the
committee to-day, and to-mornow night
it will meet In the headquarters at 850
Market street.
FREESE ON THE WARPATH.
Captain A. C. Freese. who was "turned
down" for the nomination for Public
Administrator by Boss Phelan's Conven
tion of Job Chasers, and was afterward
defeated before the Democratic annex,
sometimes called the Non-Partisan con
vention, will make a fight to succeed
himself. He will go on the ticket by
petition. A petition was circulated
throughout the downtown mercantile
houses yesterday and received many sig
natures. Captain Frepse would not have
thought of running independently had it
not been for the attack made on his of
fice at the Democratic annex sideshow.
"I have lived here the better part of
my life," said he to a friend yesterday,
"and-- 1 cannot afford to allow the un
just attack on my administration go
without rebuke. I will run as an inde
pendent candidate, and when the ballots
are counted, after election,. it will be seen
whether my detractors have more friends
that I have."
Golden Gate Republican Club.
The Golden Gate Republican Club met
last night at Metropolitan Hall, M. H.
Morgan in the chair. J. J. Cronan acted
as secretary.
Speeches were made by T. Gunnler, R.
C. McComber and A. B. O'Brien, in which
the Republican party was eulogized and
declared to be a sure winner in the pres
ent campaign.
P. B. Gallagher was indorsed by the
club by a standing vote for the position
of Superintendent of Public Instruction.
The meeting adjourned until next Thurs
day night.
Students' Club Meeting.
The Students' Club of the Twenty
eighth Assembly District held a large and
enthusiastic meeting at 29 Hunt sfreet,
near Third, last evening. T. S. Cotter,
president, opened the meeting with a neat
speech and "thanked the members for the
large attendance. The club indorsed A.
B. Treadwell for Police Judge and W. A.
Deane for County Clerk. The next meet-
Ing of the club will be held an Thursday
evening, October 13. Candidates are in
vited to attend and address the meeting.
Nominated for the Assembly.
James H. Kelly, a plumber, living at
282S Pine street, has been nominated by
the Phelan Democracy for the Assembly
from the Fortieth District. The district
Is about 600 Republican, but Kelly hopes
to make a winning fight.
Julius Kahn Club.
The Julius Kahn Republican Club of
the Thirty-first District met last night
at Tierney's Hall. There was a large at
tendance. Edward Sheahan, M. Pragley,
Thomas Graham and M. K. Tierney ad
dressed the meeting. The club decided
to attend the meeting to be addressed by
Julius Kahn at Metropolitan Hall Wed
nesday evening In a body.

WINNING FIGHT

MANY DEMOCRATS REVOLT
THEY OBJECT TO THE METHODS
OF BOSS PHELAN.
Arranging for Republican Mass
Meetings to Be Held in Every
Assembly District Before
the Campaign Closes.
The campaign committee of the Repub
lican County Committee will meet within
the next few days to map out a plan of
campaign. The committee will meet in
conference with the local candidates
and discuss the municipal situation. The
most encouraging reports are being re
ceived daily and there Is every indication
of a glorious victory on November 8. Be
fore the campaign closes the candidates
will make a tour of every Assembly dis
trict In the city and become personally
acquainted with the voters. While no
plan has yet been arranged, it is very
probable that mass meetings will be held
In every Assembly district.
The Republican party is now in better
condition than it has been in many years.
The party is not alone united, but it is
thoroughly organized in every district.
The distrtct clubs organized a few wet-Ks
ago have large membership rolls and the
campaign work is steadily going on.
The candidates will not confine their ef
forts to these meetings alone. They have
been for the past week canvassing the
city from one end to another and much
food work has been accomplished. Ihe
istrict meetings held by Henry T. Gage,
the gubernatorial candidate, and Charles
L. Patton, the leader of the local ti'-'-.-t.
resulted in arousing the interest pi all
Republicans. Wherever Gage and Patton
spoke they made man'- friends for both
the State and local tickets.
Patton is making an energetic cam
paign and is steadily drawing to him
many of Mayor Phelan's former ardent
admirers. Pnelan is fast losing ground,
and many old-time Democrats who never
voted anything but the straight ticket
are openly announcing their intention of
standing by the Republican nominees this
time ThÂ«" "slate" work of Boss Phelan s
Mutual admiration Society of One Hun
dred Job Chasers and the Democratic-
Annex that posed as a Non-Partisap
convention thoroughly disgusted the lo
cal Democracy. That there Is an open re
volt against Phelan and his nominees
cannot be denied, and it is steadily grow
ine in strength. Each succeeding day
diminishes the chances of the Democrats
and makes more certain a Republican
victory.
Acting Without Authority.
The following communication has been
received at this office:

A morning paper made a grievous error
to-day. It published an article laudatory
of Thomas Scott of Livermore. who is a

LAYING OF c GHOST.
BELIEF in ghosts is not universal. Mysterious
noises of the night do not always impress. The
hearer, if not constitutionally timid, is apt to
Bay "rats" and to be literally correct. But over in the
jail at San Rafael there has been a ghost which had
almost attained to the dignity of years. Season after
season it has been in the habit of scaring innocent
men to confession and guilty men to death. It was no
foolish ghost, wasting us time and clanking its chains
for the mere fun of hearing them rattle. 4
However, even this ghost has been dissipated,
scattered, erased. It has become a memory. No
more as the graveyards yawn will it bask in the moon
light, and with hollow groan adjure the sinner to re
pent. For this particular ghost the jig is up. It has
been caught and found to be real meat. It wears
clothes and has a footfall such as can only be pro
duced by a material brogan.
The latest man on whom the ghost tried its dis
piriting tricks was not of a nature. When
he heard the wraith moaning in agony he remarked:
"Go chase yourself." As it shook its fetters, sighed,
wept, supplicated, he added: "Go on, you make me
tired." Then the ghost retreated. It was a sensitive
ghost, and did not fancy being monkeyed with.
Perhaps it is all right for a Sheriff to play bogie
when anxious to drive a prisoner to make a clean
breast of crime, but there are other methods which
commend themselves more strongly to the humane.
To the average transgressor the thumbscrew would
be a moderate instrument of torturv compared with
the gibbering goblin. If the Sheriff is not satisfied
with the ordinary methods of securing the truth let
him try the thumbscrew or adopt the hot and
effective pincers.
THEATER MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.
AANAGER FRAWLEY, in dismissing with a
Call reporter the nuisance caused by persons
who rush out of a theater just before the close
of the performance to the great annoyance of
all who wish to catch the closing words and note the
perfect finish of a well-acted play, made a subtle and
clever distinction between that form of offense and
those which are given by ordinary ill breeding. He
said the nuisance was the result rather of custom than
of manners. To show the correctness of this distinc
tion he pointed out that the boys in the gallery never
offend in that way, while in the highest society of
Boston, where manners are almost as sacred as acts
of religion, the offense is common.
Doubtless the rafrble that hastens to rush from a
theater will be much pleased with this distinction. It
will please them to learn that they are not guilty of
bad manners, but only of a social custom. None the
less they are a rabble, and their custom is just as crude,
coarse and disorderly as if it were bad manners.
That the gallery does not offend is not surprising.
It is well known that in every English-speaking coun
try at any rate the habitues of the gallery constitute
the best authority on dramatic matters that we have.
They are the best judges of what is true in nature and
in art, and also of what is due from an audience to
the actors and what is due to itself. If, according to
Mr. Frawley's distinction of words, it may be said
they have no manners, they have at least good cus
toms, and on that score arc better than the rabble in
the orchestra stalls by every true standard known to
gods or humanity.
It will be difficult to break up a custom sanctioned
by Boston and adopted with favor by people of self
satisfying manners elsewhere, even in our own artistic
city. Some men and some women will always delight
to stalk down the aisles after the general audience is
seated in order to show off. That sort of thing is done
even in the churches. Others will like to hasten out
before the curtain falls in order to have a chance to
rush the growler before they take the cars. It is cus
tom, and custom, it seems, is even greater than man
ners.
Difficult as may be the task of making this custom
so much more honored in the breach than the ob
servance that it will be no longer observed by any
body, it i* worth while making the attempt. It is al
ways worth while to fight a nuisance. If no other
means of shaming the rabble can be devised, the gal
lery gods might be authorized to hoot the custom for
a time. A few well directed volleys of "Cheese it,*
"Stag the geezer." "Get on to his nibs," "Contemplate
the dame." "Where did you get that tile?" "Sit down
on yourself." and other saber cuts of Saxon speech
might make the custom so uncomfortable that none
would dare to persist in it.
Esterhazy is likely to be expelled from the Legion
of Honor, but. if there is a Legion of Dishonor,any
where, he ought to make a star member.
The more California hears about the boys of the

THE MOGUIRE OF RECORD.
WE have from time to time presented Maguire's
record, as made by himself, in his speeches
and letters. Such a record is in evidence and
issue when a man becomes a candidate. No man can
suddenly take off the record and convictions and ex
pressions of a lifetime like an old coart and ask the
people to consider him as something other than he
has made himself. Maguire is very anxious to create
a record for Mr. Gage that Mr. Gage has not made
for himself. He strives to falsely create for Gage a
"railroad" record, when the real record of Mr. Gage
is entirely different. His law practice has been
against the railroad, not for it. He stood with the
people for San Pedro as against Santa Monica, and
his whole record is that a railroad should attend to
its legitimate business in a lawful and just way.
It is one of the amusements of the campaign that
Magiiire. while runnningaway from his ownrecord,tries
to invest Gage with a record that does not belong to
him. Nothing is more significant than Maguire's
silence on land confiscation. His record on that sub
ject is long and prominent. He has insisted that the
land-owners are a privileged class, and that their
privilege must be taken from them and their invest
ment in land destroyed. This rs his own language,
and he says that while it will be a hardship to the
land-owner it will not be unjust.
At the close of the last Presidential campaign he
printed in the Examiner of November 6, 1896, the
following letter:
"THE NEXT GREAT ISSUE.
"It may be that another great national campaign
must be devoted to restoring the liberty of the people
to use gold and silver freely and without limit as
money. If so, the land question may be thereby
further postponed, but it is coming, and it is near at
hand. Few, even of those who believe in it, realize
how thoroughly and how generally the single tax
idea is taking hold of the public heart. Already the
single-taxers demand that practical effort be com
menced immediately to force the issue into politics
in California.
''The Legislature will be asked at its next ses
sion to submit to the voters a constitutional
amendment remitting the whole question of taxa
tion for State, county and municipal purposes to
the Legislature as a first step toward the single
tax. The moment that amendment is submitted
the battle will be on in earnest.
"Educational work will be commenced at once, and
all who are willing to take part in the distribution of
literature in their several neighborhoods are requested
to communicate with James D. Reynolds Esq., 405
Montgomery street, in this city.
"The land question is the greatest and the simplest
of all possible political issues. It touches and materi
ally affects the interests of every human being, from
the richest landlord to the most miserable tramp.
"Every human being has a natural relation to the
land, the common heritage of all mankind from the
immediate gift of the Creator, which no human law
can, or ever could, rightfully cut off by any form or
system of land tenure (title).
"God intended that every- man, woman and child, in
all ages and generations, should have access to the
land which He has freely and abundantly supplied for
their support. The curse of undeserved poverty in
the world to-day is directly traceable to the perversion
of God's bounty by the monopoly of land, and the
modern spirit of altruism demands that it shall cease.
"Landlordism has never added the value of a farth
ing to the wealth, nor a joy to the world's stock of
happiness. It is a sordid, extortionate system which
compels the masses of God's children to pay tribute
to a few for the privilege of inhabiting God's earth.
It cannot be justified on any moral ground, and it
must ultimately fall and perish before the advancing
forces of social evolution which are ever carrying our
civilization to higher and higher levels.
"The single tax is the scientific and effective remedy
for land monopoly. It should be studied immediately
and earnestly by every man and woman who would
keep abreast of truth. JAMES G. MAGUIRE."
There is the same vitriolic denunciation of the land
owner that runs through all his speeches and letters.
It will be observed that he gave notice of the con
stitutional amendment No. 2, which, when submitted,
was to bring the battle on in earnest. That amend
ment was asked of the Legislature at its session fol
lowing this letter. It is now before the people. It
will have the vote of every land confiscator in the
State, as will Maguire. Its submission to the people
is concurrent with his candidacy, and yet he says land
confiscation is not an issue!
In 1896 he denied that any law can give a man ten
ure or title to land. Therefore the present land
owners, according to Maguire, do not own the land
they have paid for and have tilled and made fertile
and beautiful by their toil. It belongs to "the chil
dren of God," says this fanatic, who takes to himself
the office of telling mankind what the Divine purpose
is.
The land-owner who has earned the money as a
mechanic or a laborer to invest in real estate is to
have his investment destroyed because Maguirr de
nounces him as a "sordi<^ extortionist."
We object, in the interest of fair play and decency,
to the sinister and evasive and indirect method by
which Mapin're and the land confiscators are forward
ing their schemes. They coax amendment No. 2
through the Legislature of 1897, get it submitted to
the popular vote, refuse to discuss it and declare it is
not in issue; while they know that it was planned by
them two years ago, and that under it they expect to
destroy land titles and investments in this State.
They know, too, that a small minority of the voters
may adopt this amendment. The constitution only
requires that a majority of those who vote on an
amendment shall adopt or reject it. If there are 10,
000 land confiscators in the State they will lie low
and vote for amendment No. 2, while the land
owners, deceived by Maguire's deliberate misstate
ment that this question is not an issue, may omit to
vote against it. If 15.000 vote on the amendment and
only 10.000 are for it, it is adopted, and under it
Maguire can rarry out all his land confiscation
policy.
General Shafter explains that Richard Harding
Davis is disgruntled because the General chose to run
the Santiago campaign himself instead of turning it
over to the correspondent. This accords with a theory
that had already been advanced.
If the people of the South were to intelligently
combat yellow fever instead of going into a panic at
its first appearance every year, it is more than possible
that it might get discouraged and quit coming.
Perhaps it is as well that the Vizcaya cannot be
raised. The people of this country have never liked
that vessel much since its visit to New York while
the Maine was in the mud of Havana harbor.
It is not too much to say that General Wheeler
knows more of the conduct of the war than Editors
Hearst and Pulitzer could teli him.

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1898.
MR. PHELAN'S SIDE SHOW.
IN a letter to The Call published on Monday C. B.
Perkins, a conspicuous member of the Non-Parti
san "Convention," complains because a correspond
ent has referred to his party in these columns as a
"piece club.". He thinks the designation is discour
teous and insulting, and he declares that the respect
able citizens who compose the Non-Partisan party
do not deserve any such criticism. In his opinion
they ought at least to have the credit of unselfishness,
since they are devoting their time to the reformation
of local politics at considerable expense and personal
annoyance to themselves.
We agree with our correspondent in his objections
to the designation "piece club." The Non-Partisan
party is not a "piece club" in the obnoxious sense in
which that term is generally used; that is to say, it
does not sell its nominations and a majority of its
members are not looking for offices, as was recently
the case with Mayor Phelan's Committee of One
Hundred. As we understand the term, a "piece club"
is a club which for a specified sum will take a specified
political course, and it was to abate the evils of that
species of politics that the Legislature in 1878 passed
the anti-piece club act.
While the Non-Partisan party cannot be appro
priately called a "piece club," its recent course in poli
tics has laid it liable to charges of insincerity, bunko
steering, jobbery and bad faith. Had the Non-Parti
san convention demanded a "piece" for its nomina
tions it would to our mind have committed a less
grave offense against the people than it has perpe
trated by bargaining with Mayor Phelan's Demo
cratic machine. As a "piece club" its character would
have been apparent and its influence nil. Under its
present cloak of respectability it is enabled to bunko
Republican voters and deliver them to Democratic
candidates. In other words, it is serving the devil in
the livery of heaven and all the time holding up its
hands and declaring that it is a holy of holies.
Had the local Republican party nominated a weak
or unsatisfactory ticket we should have accepted the
judgment of the Non-Partisan convention without
comment. But as a matter of fact the Republican
candidates are generally men of high character and
proved integrity, and as such they were entitled to
Non-Partisan indorsement. Two-thirds of the Non-
Partisans are Republicans, and, all things being equal,
Republican candidates are at least entitled to their con
sideration. But Mr. Fitch's party not only nominated
Boss Phelan himself for Mayor in advance of all con
ventions, but it has indorsed nine of his Supervisors
and all his candidates for patronage offices'.' This has
been done at the behest of a ring of Democratic
politicians in the Non-Partisan "convention."
The Non-Partisan party should not be called a
"piece club," but a worse term might be invented to
fit its case. As now organized it is a contrivance for
bunkoing Republican voters into voting the Demo
cratic ticket, and as such it is a fraud of the first mag
nitude. However, as a tail to Phelan's kite it is bound
to lose its character and reputation. For all practical
purposes it might as well, therefore, be a "piece club."
It is certainly a Democratic side show, which, con
sidering the character of its membership, is equally
as disreputable.
THE RIGHT MAN FOR SHERIFF-
AMONG the Native Sons who have become
noted for public spirit and a patriotic regard
for the advancement of the city and the State
is Henry S. Martin, the Republican nominee for
Sheriff. A gentleman by birth and breeding, a heavy
taxpayer, representing the business and property in
terests of the city, genial and cordial in all tlie rela
tions of life, he has thoroughly merited the popu
larity he enjoys and the esteem in which he is held
by all classes of citizens.
While Mr. Martin has long been prominent in the
order of Native Sons, having for years held the office
of grand treasurer, and has at all times taken a keen
interest in public affairs and fulfilled the political
duties which our Government requires of a citizen, he
has never held office. Nevertheless few men are bet
ter known to the people. His strong and winning
personality has been felt throughout the community,
and he is everywhere recognized as one who can be
counted on to be faithful to every duty intrusted to
him.
His nomination for the office of Sheriff is one of
the best made by the Republican convention. To the
ticket, so strong in all respects, his name gives addi
tional strength. His fitness for performing the work
and sustaining the responsibilities of the place are in
disputable. His business qualifications and experience
will enable him to conduct the complexities of the
work of the office with an easy mastery of all its de
tails, while his high character and position in the city
are guarantees of the fidelity and integrity that are re
quired for the honorable performance of its duties.
Mr. Martin should have the support of all independ
ent voters as well as of Republicans. He is the right
man for Sheriff, and when elected will serve the coun
ty as efficiently as in the office of the grand treasurer
he has served the Native Sons.
Since five members of an immune regiment have
been shot to death in one day, the fact becomes evi
dent that the boasted immunity does not embrace
every possibility of soldier life.
Manager Frawley will have general sympathy in his
effort to make people manifest in the theater the same
evidences of Rood breeding that elsewhere would be
considered indispensable.
America is not too proud to acknowledge that in
the matter of taking care of an army far from its
base of supply, it has a few things to learn froic
General Kitchener.
From time to time pugilists announce that they are
ready to fight, but one thing which tends to check
sports is that no two of them get in this mood at the
same time.
Perhaps the easiest way out of it would be to write
a confession for Mrs. Botkin. persuade her to sign
it, and then hang her in the corridor of the city jail.
France doesn't know whether it is a nation or a

Spain would sell us the Philippines for $400,000,

we can have them for the taking.
Abuses now practiced in Cuba demonstrate that
the United States will be obliged to give the Cubans
a lesson in manners.
As Mayor Phelan "hefts" his chances of election,
his practiced judgment must tell him they are stead
ily growing less.
There seems to be a scheme to make Dewey an
admiral and Sampson a scapegoat. The latter will

CONFIDENCE IN THE PEOPLE
IHE BIRTHDAY OF FATHER
MATHEW CELEBRATED.
Pointed Words of the Priest Which
Reflect on the Present Political
Situation Hn ThiÂ»
City.
An audience of 2000 gathered last even
lng at Metropolitan Temple to celebrate
â¢with the boys of the League of the Cross
the birthday of the good Father Mather
and to hear the Rev. Father Yorke
in his opinion of "the boss with a plug
hat." and by pointed allusion of the Grand
Kxalted Hffter.
Though the powerful words of Father
Yorke were in eulogy of the good Father
Mathew, whose splendid work of temper
ance was taken up by the League of the
Cross when he. perforce, had laid it
down, it was purely by antitheses that
these virtues were pointed out.
â¢â¢BoysV said Father Yorke, "Father
Mathew understood his people and he
loved them, He did more, he trusted
them. They had their vices and their sin;?
and let me tell you that you will find
them everywhere. There are ills of the
body politic as well as personal ills, and
the "way to correct them is the same. It
was Father Mathew's way. He trusted his
people and did not try to force them with
law< that he had made, or with sermons
or anything of that sort. He went among
them with trust, he showed them by ex
ample a!'.d by homely comparisons the
â¢ . of the right and the clean, and
they believed him.
"And. boys, if you want to succeed, it
be bo with your work and your gov- .
eminent. N<> matter what the newspaper? I
may say about fighting fire with fire, j
putting down a boss with overalls i
*boes v.ith a plug hat." you must I
trust the people; they will not be forced â 
oled. Show them the right and they
will take it if you trust them to do it. but
neither with one boss nor another can you
force them to it."
And in the same pointed strain Father
Yirke continued for as much as an hour.
By implication he warned his youth
ful charges against the evils of poli
tics and liossipm and uncleanliness in af
fairs of government, and as the most
horrible example held up to the ears of
his hearers "the boss with the plug hat."

worked all yesterday in dirty shirts and
collars after a sleepless night think so
at any rate. Sunday was ideal yachting
weather and quite a number of sloops
were out. Among them were the Juanlta,
Catherine, Twilight and Sappho. On the
latter sloop Captain Lew Haven had the
lowa band and a few friends, while on
the Juanita Captain John Savery had
about twenty invited guests. On the Cath
erine there were twelve and on the Twi
light there were sixteen ladies and gen
tlemen.
The trip around the bay was a most
enjoyable one and toward evening the
yachtsmen saw thnt they were In for a
adjournment was made to the clubhouse,
and there everybody enjoyed a pleasant
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1898.
jecting step of the beer wagon and
Haggerty was thrown violently to the
pavement. He struck upon his face on
the curbstone, his body lying directly
before the front wheels of his wagon,
which passed over him, badly fractur
ing his left leg above the ankle. The
rear wheels of the heavy truck passed
over his chest, breaking several ribs
and inflicting internal injuries that
may yet result fatally*. Haggerty was
taken to his home, after being per
mitted to lie for nearly an hour's time
upon the sidewalk within a hundred
yards of the scene of the accident. A
physician was summoned, but up to
couple of hours. The captains of the
yachts noticed that the wind was falling
light and counseled a start for San Fran
cisco, but the ladies said there was plenty
of time, and thus another hour passed.
When everybody was finally aboard the
yachtsmen said that they were in for a
night of it. They tried all points of sail
ing, but could make no headway, so finally
an attempt was made to run through
Raccoon Straits in the hopes that there
wculd be a breeze the other side of Angel
Island. Whfcn no progreps could be made
in that direction all jollity went out of
the different parties, and some of the
ladies on the" different boats broke down
completely.
Seeing that it was impossible to make
San Francisco Sunday nigiit everybody
was anxious to let their friends and rela
tives knew that they were still in the
land cf the living, so the yachts oneo
m< re returned to Sausallto. The young
man in charge of the telephone was found
in bed and no kind of persuasion could
get him out of it. Even an offer of a
flO gold piece and double rates for his
company was not enough to induce him
tc leave' his comfortable quarters to ob.lge
fifty people who were anxious to allay
the fears of three times that many rela
tives. Then the women were broken
hearted, and it was a woe-begone crowd
that tramped back to the yachts.
It was getting along toward midnight
when another start was made for S.m
Francisco, and it was 4 a, m. yesterday
when the yachts drifted Into the cove
near Black Point. During the trip a fog
came up and the British ship Btar of
Russia, coming in from Antwerp, nearly
ran the Juanlta down. The band on the
Sappho enlivened the drifting match for
a while, but even the bandsmen suc
cumbed to melancholy, and it was a
dreary party that landed on the wharf
at Fort Mason. The first car of the
Hyde-street line bore them away, and it
is to be hoped that lapt night they all
slept well. . . ,
In the meantime the friends and rela
tives of the women on the boats were
nearly scared to death, and search par
ties were out from midnight until 10 a, m.
yesterday. Those who left the front at
that hour were in despair, but when, they
reached home found the missing ones had
been there hours before thorn. One of
the wharfingers had a scara over that
yachting excursion that he will not forget
in a hurry. .
Every available spot on the water front
is crowded with grain, and Assistant
Chief Wharfinger Scott is at his wit* enu
to know what to do with the shipments
that are pouring in. It has been the
custom to allow owners five days to re
move their grain from the front portion
of the grain sheds and fifteen days f<rr
the back portion. In view of the rush
these rules were changed yesterday, and
in future the grain merchants will only
a late hour last night the extent of
the man's injuries could not be deter
mined.

that time will be shortened If possible.
Details of police from the Harbor Sta
tion have been sent to all the transports
and the corporal's guards from the Pre
sidio are again in evidence. The Indiana

Lombard and the Senator at Broadway,

From this on no one but those hi. author

allowed aboard those vessels.
The river steamer Mary Ellen Galvin
has been made some use of at last. -. She
was built for the Yukon River trade, but
was a failure, and Pat Galvin, her owner
would -not accept her. For months she
has been In the hands of the Sheriff, and
he is using her as an advertising board.
Needless to say that none but the cards
of Democratic candidates are displayed,
but then, as the money from that source
Is turned over to the creditors of the
steamer and helps to pay the wharfage
bill, there is no kick coming.
Among the arrivals yesterday were the
ship Tacoma and the barkentines Jane
A. Falkinberg and S. N. Castle. The
latter vessel made a good run up from
Honolulu of sixteen days, while the Ta
coma took twenty-seven days. The lat
ter vessel is under charter to the United
States Government and left here with
horses for Manila. It was found that
the animals were required at. Honolulu,
so -when the Tacoma . put in there - for
water and supplies the animals were ta
ken ashore and kept there.
The Jane A. Falkinberg: is from Kotze
bue Sound via Seattle. - She brought
down a few gold hunters who were dis
appointed with the outlook, but Captain
A. H. Herriman says that no one knows
or can know anything about the pros,
pects before next year: Absolutely no
prospecting has been done, but after the
prospectors have spent a winter on the
Kubuck River tJrfey will know what pros
pects are there. ,
No fears are entertained for the safety
of the steamer Cleveland. When the
schooner Jewett, which made the run
from St. Michael to Grays Harbor in
twelve days (steamer time), left the for

was lightering her.

The dead body of Christopher Samuet
son, a shoemaker, was found yesterday
morning floating in the bay near the foot
of Beale-street wharf. The body had not
been in the water more than a day or
two. An Inquest will be held.
The dead man had worked for the last
two months for William Dautel, shoe
maker at 631% Sacramento street. Mr.
Dautel said Samuelson had been in the
habit of going on sprees, and that he saw
him last on Saturday night with $7 in his
possession. He does not believe that the
shoemaker committed suicide.

"DANCING GIRL"
AS PLAYED BY
THE FRAWLEYS
Blanche Bates' Won
derful Work.
FRANK MATHIEU'S DEBUT
NANCE O'NELL IN A FAMOUS
RISTORI PART.
Comic Season Commences at the
Tivoli â Melodrama, Society
Drama and Variety at
Other Houses.
The Frawley Company appeared at
the Baldwin last night in "The Danc
ing Girl," one of the most ambitious
of Henry Arthur Jones' plays, a play
that was presented in the same the
ater several years ago by Palmer's
Company, and gK'en a cast that is
unforgetable, a performance that we
cannot hope to see approached by any
American company that exists to-day.
So it is not wanton disparagement of
the Frawley s to say that a great deal
is lacking in their production. They
play "Th* Dancing Girl" as 'any fairly
ordered stock company with weekly
changes of bill might be expected to
doâ with one exception. That excep
tion is Blanche Bates, who, in the title
part, achieves one of the, if not the,
most remarkable successes of her life.
Her impersonation will stand compari
son with any; to me it seems that I
had never seen the part of Drusilla
Ives played until last night, norformed
any adequate idea of Its dramatic
worth.
"Flesh and blood" Is a hackneyed
phrase, especially in dramatic criti
cism, and I dare say it makes a very
small dent in the mind of the average
newspaper reader, but it is the fittest
expression I can find for describing
Miss Bates' performance. She was pas
sionately, vividly, terribly, relentlessly
flesh and blood in every moment of the
part. She played the woman for all
that was in her, slighting nothing, gild
ing over nothing that is plainly in the
lines with the mock niceties of the
drawing-room actress, sacrificing noth
ing that is in the play to the winning
of false sympathy. She made Drusilla
out to be just what she is, a Carmen of
modern social conditions. A brilliant
Drucilla, fascinating, dangerously femi
nine and full of feline grace. Miss Bates
played her fearlessly, with dash,
warmth, seduction and absolute aban
don. She gave the vital identity, men
tal and physical, and did it with the
audacity of genius.
The audience was considerable in
number and in fashion. Society was all
over the house and extended the loud
glad hand of congratulation to Frank
Mathleu, who made his first profes
sional appearanca on any stage in the
part of John Chrtstison, the village
lover of Drusilla. I think a more var
nished part would be more in Mr.
Mathieu's line; this one calls for an
amount of rough simplicity that he is
hardly prepared to give; but it at least
revealÃ a sincerity that survives no end
of bad gesture, and a clean, comely per
sonality that is just the thing in a com
pany of this character.
Mr. Frawley plays the Duke, a part
of tremendous responsibility; and wnile
no one would accuse him of doing It
perfectly. It sho-uld be a matter of gen
eral congratulation that it is the most
earnest and plausible work he has
shown this season. Theodore Roberts,
too, does serious if not sensational
work in the old father; and Miss Welles,
even though her "baby" voice is against
the conviction of the character, makes
a pretty study of lame girl. Mr.
Hickman plays the foolish Slingsby
with considerable eccentricity and some
humor, Mr. Edwards gives a quietly
good version of the Duke's steward and
Mr. Payne is an admirable valet.
But the glory of the performance be
longs to Blanche Bates. You don't
know the play until you see her Dru
silla. There Is only one weak spot in
her work, the dancing scene, and that
is incidental, and, after all, more or
less under the head of athletics, and
what she lacks in It she makes up by
the most wonderful fall downstairs that
you ever saw. ASHTON STEVENS.
The O'Niei" as E'izabeth.
Paolo Glacometti presents Queen Eliza
beth to theater goers as a vain, self
willed, unscrupulous woman conducting
the affairs of the kingdom in a cyclone
of evil temper, flitting like somo gay
humming bird in her love chases from one
flower to another, but, unlike the bird,
leaving the flowers much the worse for
the wear. It Is hard to imagine how
this red-headed hell cat could have in
spired love In the bosom of even the
bravest of men, and' Glacometti shows
how Essex braved it with his heart in
his mouth and his life in his handâkiss
ing the white hand that afterward in a
fit of petulance smote him on the cheek
before the court and provoked him to
such a splendid defiance.
The role fitted Miss O'Niei. She was
the regnl virago, frowning and squinting
with 111 temper through five- long acts of
speechmaking.
Herbert Carr as Essex divided the hon
ors with the star. His Indignation at
the preferment of High Admiral Howard
and others over himself on his return
from the conquest of the Spaniards and
his bold defiance of the Queen won for
himself and Miss O'Niei a Â«ill before the
curtain at the end of the third act. This
act is the only one in the piny that had
any life In. it at all, the other acts be
in? composed of long-winded speeches by
the characters without any action to re
lieve them.
The disagreeable feature of the per
formance was the frequency with which
the voice of the prompter was heard in
the wings.
Jhe TiVoli.
The "Circus Queen," on this week at
the Tivoli, is the hit oi the season fh the
line of comic opera. Catchy music, bril
liant costumes, appropriate scenery and,
above all, a talented company, give the
opera-going people a change for rare en
joyment. In the "Circus Queen," classi
fied as an operatic fantasie, Edwin Ste
vens appears to better advantage than
in any other play of the many in his
repertoire. He is funny in this piece,
very funny, and fun is what the people
Miss Annie Myers, as the Queen, wins
encore after encore, but is not more pop
ular than Miss Anna Lichter. the bride
of the forced wedding, or Miss Elvla
Crox who assumes the character of the
Grand Duke Vladimir. Phil Bran
son gained repeated applause of the au
dience by his good singing and grotesque
antics as Merryman. the clown. All car
ried their parts well, and the success of
opening night assures crowded houses
for the rest of the season.
The
Belasco and De Miile's well-known sen
timental drama. "The Wife," was pre
sented at the Alcazar last night to a
crowded house. It was an evenly bal
anced representation and the stock com
pany scored a success. Ernest Hastings
as the husband. Gretchen Lyons as the
wife Frank Denlthorne as the lover,
George Osbourne as the father and How
ard Scott as the villain were all good,
and Francis Yale and I^aura Crews as
the young lovers are deserving of special
mention.
JYlorosco's.
"The Lights o' London" was revived at
the Grand Opera House last night. The
performance was a very even one and
the performecs won a number of recalls
from the aualence. One or two of the j
players were not letter perfect In their j
parts, and there were a few hitches In !
changing the scenes. These defects will ;
doubtless be remedied and the play will j
go like clockwork to-night.
As Harry Armytage, James M. Brophy j
was good." although a little less of hand
clapping and thigh slapping would be an
Improvement. As his wife. Miss Maud ;
Miller carried the sympathies of the au- ;
dience throughout. She sustained tne i
character admirably. Fred J. Butler as \
Seth Preene, the North Country poacher, :
was also very good, and so was Madge
Daley as Shakespeare Jarvls.
The Grand Opera House management ,
deserves a word of praise for the manner â 
in which the play was mounted. Next ;
week "Straight From the Heart" will be j
put on.
Th? y\lhambra.
Vaudeville is an elastic term; at least
Manager Jackson of the Alhambra Thea
ter has that conception of the meaning of
the word. In his programme this week
he draws on the time-honored "legiti
mate" for Robert Downing, who presents
a twenty-minute version of "Ingomar;"
on the comic opera stage, for Will Rising
and his company, who present a humor
ous opera, "Why," that contains several
catchy numbers; on the dramatic stage,
George C. Boniface and Nonna Ferner.
who appear as Sir Peter and Lady Teazle
in the quarrel scene from "School for
Standal"; and on the vaudeville stage, for
foreland, Thompson and Roberts, who
have a very laughable sketch; the Oli
fans, who have a new grotesque act; Ford
and Lewis; Lillian Smith and others.
Miss Daisy Hamlin is a new face this
week. She has a sweet soprano voice.
JKÂ« Orpheum.
Several new features were presented at
the Orpheum last night that sufficed to
highly amuse a large audience. The
best among these was the clever and
amusing work of Mary Norman, "society
caricaturist." Her imitations of the fads
and foibles of society girls in variety as
seen in Boston, Xew York and San Fran
cisco and her singing were highly Inter
talning. She will be a star attraction
during her engagement. Mr. and Mrs.
Dunstan have a new act. entitled "Bella's
Baby," which is decidedly crisp, laugh
able and calculated to make one hold
his breath in some of the situations.
While it is a harmless chapter of mis
conceptions, there are some lines that are
brflad enough to stand considerable prun
ing. Johnson and Deane, the "King and
Queen of colored aristocracy," are a cap
tivating team, the former being one of
the best grotesque "coon" dancers seen
here in a long time. The "Comedy
Ponies" were not in good humor on their
introduction, but the stars finally gave a
clever performance illustrating the great
Intelligence of these toy horses.
Jhe Olympia.
The Olympia is still entertaining large
audiences. Aside from the holdovers the
favorites last night were Irene Johnson,
the clever singer of coon songs formerly
at the Orepheum, and Lottie Ryers. the
singing soubrette, who is filling a return
engagement, much to the satisfaction of
the patrons of the house.

EASTERN MARKETS.
â  . NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â The room traders on
the Stock Exchange turned bears again to-day
and sold stocks all through the list. Outside
of a few cases they did not meet with much
success In securing a following, but in a num
ber of high-priced specialties and .later in
the day in some of the railroads, the declining
market did induce some liquidation. This !
was notably the case in Northern Pacific,
â¢which went in the last hour to-day to 35%. a
loss of I**, and closed heavy in tone. Offer-
Ings in this stock w*re very^ large and the
price movement revived rumors of irreconcij
able differences between the two powerful
financial interests in th.- property. The lar^e
German holding- of this stock made it peculiar
ly susceptible to the effects of money strin
gency in Berlin, indicated in the rise In the
Imperial Hank rate to-day to 5 per cent. The
fame factor affected other railroad stocks also. I
In fact, the Influence of all foreign markets
â was on the side of the bears. The negotia
tions between Great Britain and France, ex
posed by the publication of the Fashoda blue
book, caused sufficient apprehension to pro
duce a decline of % in British consols and to
unsettle all the European markets. Th con
tinued uneasiness In France over domestic
politics and the possibility of the failure of j
the Peace Commission to agree upon terms
were also on the side of the bears.
There was some alarm over the spread of
yellow fever In the South, in which Illinois
Central was the most severe sufferer, losing 1%
points. Losses In the Grangers reached a
point except in St. Paul, which resisted the
decline. The principal activity of the mar
ket, however, continued to center in the in
dustrial group, and Sugar fell to HO with no
visible support. The offerings on the de
cline were very large. People's Gas. Rubber.
Leather preferred, Manhattan. Metropolitan
Street Railway and New York Air Brake were
all sufferers at one time or another during the
day to the extent of from 1 to 7 points. To
bacco was a prominent feature, but ruled
above Saturday's level the greater part of the
day in acquisition of a large plug tobacco in
terest. The price advanced at one time over
3 points; the stock closed unchanged. Lake
Erie and Western common and preferred fell
at one time 3% and 10% points respectively.
The preferred rallied nearly 3 points. There
â¢was no news to account for the decline. A
loss of 3 points In Oregon Navigation pre
ferred was also unexplained. There were no
reflections in the stock market of the active
foreign demand for wheat for export or of the \
evidences of the expanding business of the
country in the increased demands of the "West
for money. The transfers of currency at the
sub-treasury for . shipment to the . West
amounted to $810,000. Conditions in the money
market continued easy.
Bonds weakened late in the day In sympathy
with stocks, Wisconsin Central firsts losing
an extreme 2% and Oregon Short Line increas
ing 1%. Total sales. $2.Â«0,000.
United States old fours coupon and fives ad
vanced Vi an/1 the new fours registered and

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here opened flat to-day on the Fash
oda dispute and the rise in the German bank
race, but closed better generally on favorable
advances from Parte. Kaffirs were especially
strong on the announcement of a favorable
trial of crushing by the Pioneer mine in the
Rhodesian District. The only effect on the
German Bourse of the rise in the bank rate
was to cause attempts to sell German consols
an,] utner investment stocks In this market, <
Selling from Berlin of Americans has quite
ceased for the moment. Nevertheless Ameri
cans were dull, closing near the lowest, in the
' New York support. New York and
are competing for gold here at 77s lud.
It Is believed here that the worst of the finan
cial strain at Berlin is over. The London short
rate for money rose to 3 per cent, subject to
possible advance in the Bank of England rate
on Thursday.

THE CROP REPORT.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.â In the crop report
issued to-day by the Agricultural Department
the usual wheat report is withheld, pending the
result 01" further investigation.
The preliminary estimate of the yield per acre
of barley is 21.6 bushels, or 1.9 bushels less per
acre than in 1837, and 1.3 bushels below the
mean October estimates tor the last ten years.
The average for quality is 91.3, as compared
with 87. tf last year.
The preliminary estimate of the yield per
acre of rye is 15.6 bushels. This is five- tenths
of a bushel less than the average of last' year,
but 2.2 bushels above the mean of the October
averages for ten years. The average quality
reported is 90.1, against 92.7 one year ago.
The condition of buckwheat has declined
since September 1 12.6 per cent, being now
76.2. This is 14.6 per cent below the average
on October 1, 1597, and 8.3 per cent below the
mean of the October averages of the last ten
years.
The condition of Irish potatoes declined 5.2
per cent during September. While it is still
1.9 per cent higher than the October condition
last year, it is 2.7 per cent below the mean of
the October averages of the last ten years.
The apple reports show a decline In every
State in which this crop is of any commercial
importance, except in Maine, Michigan, Ne
braska and Oregon, where a slight improvement
is indicated.
The yield per acre of hops is generally in ex
cess of last year, California, where the yield
will probably not exceed 1000 pounds to the
acre, being the exception.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. Liverpool Wheat quota
tions before business started here showed an
advance of lVi@l%d over last night's close on
fears as to the controversy with France over
the Nile territory. That advanced values here
sharply at the opening and the traders were
stimulated into unusual activity. Additional
Impetus was given the market by the fact that
shipment* from Russia last week showed a
falling off of some 600,000 bushels as compared
with those of the preceding week, and because
of heavy cable acceptances of * Wheat offers
made over Sunday by exporters. To further
add to the discomfort of those who went short
from last week, there were." â¢pointers*',. in circu
lation that the Government crop report would
make a very bullish showing in Wheat. The
combination was sufficient to cause general
covering by shorts of almost every sort. . Mean
while the early bearish news was entirely dis
regarded. The Michigan authorities estimated
the -total yield of that State as the largest ever
known there, New South Wales placed her ex
portable surplus greater than usually reported
for all of Australia and that the foreigners
were reselling Wheat on account of the sd^arp
advance in prices. In consequence of this the
market did not fully maintain its early figures,
nevertheless the trade was not disposed to ham
mer prices, as the liberal rains in j the North
west promised to ' cut off . receipts somewhat.
Another factor that discouraged any heavy
selling was that the visible supply only.sh<*ved
an increase of 947,000 bushels, whereas art In
crease of '-1,500,000. bushels had been expected.
Primary market receipts were 2,151,000 bushels,
against 2,847,000 bushels the previous year. Re
ports from the seaboard that the export en
gagements aggregated. 105 boat loads and tV

ers say that there is an equal deficiency this
year, and some even place It higher. Hence,
they argue, Hay is bound to rule firm anyhow,
rain or no rain.

FRED DAVIS,
COUNTY EXPERT,
HAS RESIGNED
A Surprise Before the
Supervisors.
SURMISE AS TO THE CAUSE
HAD IT ANY CONNECTION WITH
THE GRAND JURYP
Davis Did Not Offer Any Explana
tion, but Gave Up His Position
With Appropriate
Courtesy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broudway, Oct. 10.
Fred A. Davis, who has been for a long ]
time county expert, surprised everybody j
to-day by tendering his resignation to the j
Board of Supervisors. No one had any
Intimation that the resignation was to be
presented, and it was whispered in the
lobby that it must have some connection
with the doings of the Grand Jury.
A week ago the Grand Jury instructed |
the District Attorney to bring suit for |
the recovery of a number of bills aggre
gating a few thousand dollars which had j
Been paid without any warrant of law. I
This action created some surprise, as the j
bills had all been regularly exported and j
passed upon by the Finance committee ,
of the Supervisors.
Some months ago there was some dis
faction over the office of expert and j
a resolution was passed by the Hoard of j
Supervisors setting forth the hours dur-
Ing which all employes of the board must ,
be on duty.
Still later at the primary election Air.
I'avls was one of the officers of election,
and some talk was caused by the manner i
In which the primaries were conducted in ,
the Fourth \\ anl.
Still later the Grand Jury took up the j
matter of experting county claims, and (
some very remarkable discoveries were
madÂ©, plainly showing fraud on the part
of some of those who swore to their bills. |
While these matters did not directly affect j
Expert Davis, they added to the growing !
dissatisfaction existing, although no one j
was prepared for the sudden resignation, j
The expert offered no explanation, but .
merely said "I herewith tender my resig- \
nation as counfy expert with the reauest
that the same be accepted to date from
to-day. I thank you all for the courtesy :
and assistance given me In the discharge j
of my duties."
The resignation was accepted and E. B. |
Bullock, formerly secretary of the Board ;
of Education in Alameda, was appointed I
to nil the vacancy at a salary of *125 per I
month.
Supervisor Roeth ohjected to taking im
ite action. He said Davis had not
attended to his duties fur the past week.
and Roeth did not believe him entitled to
for that period. Supervisor Wells
T'jper tim. I was
when Davis' bill was presented for ap
proval. Davis was not present at the
meeting to-day. It is understood that he
Intends to remove to San Francisco.
TRYING TO STAMP OUT
A SCOURGE AT NILES
SCARLET FEVER IN THAT BURG I
VERY PREVALENT.
I
A Delegation Appears Before the Su- j
. pervisors Asking for Power to
Check the Malady.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Oct. 10.
The prevalence of scarlet fever at Xiles j
is now regarded as very serious, and it |
has about reached- the proportion of an '
epidemic. There are nearly a score of I
cusea among the residents, and many |
more in the Portuguese section. Some !
time ago the public school was ordered j
closed as a precautionary measure, but
the disease still spread, and yesterday
the Sunday-pchools were closed, and un
less a change occurs before next Sunday
there will be no church services.
A delegation of people from Niles vis- i
ited the Supervisors to-day to see if some
steps could not be taken to enforce meas
ures that will stam;i out the disease.
Some time ago it was discovered that
there is no legal authority for the ap- ]
pointment of county health officers, and j
those then in office were discharged. !
Since that time there has been no au- i
thority outside of the towns and cities !
for the enforcement of any sanitary reg
ulations, and this Is blamed in part for
the present condition of affairs at Nlles.
The Supervisors were asked to appoint
an officer, or at least to take some steps I
that would result in forcing the adop- |
tion of precautionary measures and the j
carrying out of quarantine when desired.
In addition to sixteen cases reported !
it is known that many cases exist in the ;
Portuguese section that have not been j
made known. Just how far the fever
has spread is not known, but there Is
genuine consternation in the township,
and a general desire that some author!- i
tative step be taken to protect the In
habitants. Some of the localities where j
the scarlet fever exists are among the i
most unsanitary, and It is believed that !
if everything that has a tendency to I
breed and spread the disease were re- I
moved, the epidemic would disappear in
a very short time.
Dr. B. A. Chalmers appeared before the
Supervisors, and the matter was referred '
to Supervisor Wells.

occupied almost the same place It did

NO MEETING OF THE
COUNCIL LAST NIGHT
CITY DEPARTMENTS IN A STATE
OF CONSTERNATION.
Much Feeling Over the Tax Levy.
Sentiment Regarding the Lake
Merritt Appropriation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
- Broadway, Oct. 10.
No Council meeting was called for this
evening and there is consternation in all
the city departments. Mayor Thomas has
not yet filed his veto of the ordinance
which is so unpopular and which was
passed by the votes of the eolid six, and
consequently nothing is being done in this
very important matter.
To-day is the first day under the law on
â which taxes should be made payable, bur
the levy is not yet fixed and it will be im
ble to have tax bills ready for some
weeks, and unless the Council and Mayor
take some action thr city will soon be in
a very bad tangle financially.
It is quite certain that it will be im
possible to obtain eight votes to pass the
obnoxious tax levy ordinance over the
veto of the Mayor, for the Council is di
vided by six to five without any possible
hope of a break from either slue. There
is a growing feeling Rmong the public
that the ordinance should be so altered
as to include only Ho ,ooo for Lake Mer
ritt and to make the matter of building
the east and west side sewers, which are
to cost }.â 'â  ."â '"â . a district undertaking, so
that in addition to the amounts as pro
vided by the ordinance at present, there
will be $78,500 to add to the department
expenses, which will make them equal to
the amount spent last year.
This apportionment of the funds will be
. opposed by the Lake Merritt Improve
ment Club, which has done a great deal to
secure permanent improvement of its
[ty ami which is ready to
turn i to valuable lands as soon
-^ured that such improvements will
be carried out. A reasonable adjustment
of the difficulty would seem to be to put
S*o,UOO into the Lake Merritt improvement
for this year, and to try to secure a party
pledge from the municipal conventions
that the Council to be elected in March
shall appropriate a like amount next
>*ear, thus assuring the completion of the
; "work.
ALLEN ACCUSED OF
STEALING A HOTEL
GAVE A MORTGAGE FROM AN
UNKNOWN OWNER.
Presented Memoranda That Indicated
He Was Worth a Hundred
Thousand.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 10.
William H. Allen, an old man who says
his age is 73, was arrested this evening
on a charge of obtaining a furnished lodg
ing-house under false pretenses. The com
plaint was sworn to by John Linderman,
proprietor of the Winters Hotel, who sold
his hostelry to Allen four months ago for
J2500. '
As security for payment of the debt
Allen transferred' to Linderman a mort
gage on thirty-two and a half acres of
land in Contra Costa County and a note
for a similar amount drawn by one John
Langlitz.
Linderman now declares that Allen
never owned any property and that the
mortgage and note are bogus, and acting
on this belief, he swore to the warrant.
At the City Prison some curious memo
randa were found on Allen. They referred
to property in many States, consisting of
realty, gold mines, furnished houses and
stocks, and made it appear that Allen was
worth $156,400. The prisoner declines to
discuss the details of his alleged owner
ship, but he says he will come out of it
all right.
Detective Holland has been working on
the case and he says that there is no such
name as John Langlitz on the records of
Contra Costa, and that William H. Allen
does â â ml own anything in either Alameda
or Contra Costa counties.
A Constable Indicted.
OAKLAND, Oct. 10.â Grand Jury
returned five more indictments this after
noon and the warrants were Issued from

rants are for perjury for swearing to Ir
regular claims and the bail Is fixed at
$2000 on each charge. Yon Kopff was ar
rested to-night. Up to a late hour Yon
Kopff had secured one. bondsman, George
Brown of Alamr-da, but being unable to
get another to qualify he was taken to
the County Jail.

ASSESSMENT FIXED.
Non-Partisan Nominees Must Put Up
BO Per Cent of the Amount They
Are Allowed to Spend.
Deacon Fitch's annex to Boss Phelan's
Mutual Admiration Society of One Hun- j
drÂ»d Job Chasers met last night in Na
tive Sons 1 Hall for the purpose of fixing
the rate of assessment of its nominees.
Several of the victims of Its choice ap
peared before the meeting and after the
reporters had been excluded a general
discussion took place as to how much the
traffic would bear. Under the purity of
elections law candidates are limited in
their campaign expenses to a percentage
of their first year's salary where elected
for more than one year. Having this in
mind, and the fact that under thÂ« new
charter If it passes, the officers elected
this fall will probably hold office but one
year, there was a difference of opinion as
to how much a candidate was entitled to
spend. It was finally agreed that they
would be elected for two years under the
present law, even though their term of
Office might be curtailed later, so the as
sessment was fixed at 20 per cent of the
amount they are entitled to spend, which
will be 10 per cent of their first year's
salary. The nominees for School Direct
ors put up $20 each to the support of the
Non-Partlsan campaign.

TRIED TO END
HER SORROWS
IN SUICIDE
Story of a Variety
Actress.
FRIENDLESS AND HUNGRY
MINNIE HALL ATTEMPTS TO
JUMP INTO THE BAY.
Saved by a Policeman as She Was
About to Take the Fatal
Plungeâ Her Life a
Failure.
Driven from her room by an uncharit
able landlady and being unable to buy the
necessaries of life, Minnie Hall, who
claims to be a variety actress, attempted
to end her troubles yesterday by throwing
herself in the bay.
She was prevented by a policeman, who,
after listening to her sad story, took her
to the City Prison, where she was given
something to eat and a place to sleep.
According to the woman's story she ar
rived here from Seattle about three weeks
ago, and rented a room in a lodging-house
on California street near Kearny. In a
ehort time the small amount of money
fcha had was gone, and being unable to
pay the rent of her room, she appealed to
the landlady not to eject her.
"Instead of trying to assist me," tear
fully remarked the despondent woman,
when telling her story, "she took the key
of the room away from me and ordered
me out of the house.
"This was last Saturday. Sinca then I
have been strolling aimlessly about the
city without anything to eat or a place to
lay my head. When sleep overtook me I
would go into one of the parks, and, ait
ting down on a bench, managed to steal a
short nap. After brooding over my piti
able condition. I resolved to end my
troubles in the watÂ«r ot the bay. I walked
down Market street, and on reaching the
ferry I wrote my name on a card, which
I had picked up, and pinned it to my
skirt. Seeing the gay throng leaving one
of the ferry boats I grew more deter
mined to commit suicide.
Walking along the wharf contiguous to
the ferry building I took off my hat and
prepared to Jump into the water. Just as
I was about to make the plunge, a police
officer seized me by the arm and told me
I was under arrest. I begged him to al
low me to commit suicide, but he was ob
durate and made me accompany him to
the police station."
The woman further said she had worked
in a variety theater in Seattle, but becom
ing tired of the life ehe was leading, she
concluded to visit this city in the hope
of procuring better employment. She
claims that her trunk is being held by the
landlady of the house where she lived.
To-day an effort will be made to compel
the woman to surrender the trunk.
ANOTHER BLOW TO
CHINESE IMMIGRANTS
THE CALL'S COMMENTS HAVE
BORNE GOOD FRUIT.
Collector Jackson Stops Communica
tion Between Mongolians Wish
ing to Land and Resi
dents.
The revelations made recently In The
Call concerning' the success of the Chi
nese slave importing- bureau in landing
Chinese slaves and coolie laborers have
awakened the Interest and vigilance of
the Federal authorities. Collector Jack
son yesterday issued the following: order,
whlsh la a practical acknowledgment of
the atand taker^ by The Call that this un
holy traffic should stop and that the white
labor of the Pacific Coast should be pro
tected from the incursions of these yellow
barbarians.
Office of the Collector of Customs, Port of
San Francisco â To all Inspectors on vessels
and docks having Chinese therein :
The following instructions are Issued for
information and guidance in the matter of
ChlnsM persons who may seek a landing at
this port:
Every Chinese employe of a vessel may be
searched for either contraband goods or writ
ten communications, when he passes off the
ahlp.
When a Chinese person Is being landed from
a vessel or the sheds where other Chinese
persons are detained wtio are Becking to land,
his baggage and person should be thoroughly
searched for written Chinese matter, and the
same, if any be found, taken from him.
Officers on the dock who take letters from
Chinese persons seeking to pass the same to
friends on shore should examine the ticket of
the Chinese person from whom they take the
letter, and note the number thereof. They
should write the date, circumstances of seiz
ure, number of ticket, etc., so that this in
formation may reach thy Chinese Bureau
promptly, and In such shape as to be of use
In the courts. It is not sufficient alone to seize
the letter. It must be connpeted with the Chi
nese person in the manner stated, else the
case cornea to naught in the court.
When a Chinese person on shore seeks to
pass a letter or other written matter to an
other Chinese person who Is In custody, the of
ficer at the plank should detain the Chinese
person with the letter or other written matter,
and at once turn htm over to the custody of
the Chinese Bureau. If this should occur af
ter business hourÃ the detained person (or per
sons) who MÂ«ka to pass or does pass the let
ter or written matter may be taken to the
County Jail and held until the next dayâ
which action will quickly become known to
the Chinese here and applying for a landing,
and, as a consequence, further efforts by
them to pass letters, etc., will cease.
All communications relating to Chinese mat
ters and Feixure of letters or written matter
should be at once sent direct to the inspector
In charge of the Chinese Bureau; thus insur
ing that officer's earliest knowledge thereof
and also avoiding all Intermediate delay.
In the execution of above Instruction Inspec
tors are expected to exercise a reasonable dis
cretion as to the manner and extant of tholr
enforcement, the end to ba-'Wibserved being
the stoppage of communication between Chl
n<-s<? persons seeking to land here and those al
n.-a.iy on shore.
In the case of Wong Ah Fung, a Chines*?
woman admitted by Collector Jackson on
bureau evidence as being- a merchant.
Commissioner Heacock yesterday refused
to grant the motion of the defendant's at
torney to admit the testimony submitted
by the bureau In favor of the woman. He
declared that the case must be tried u^i
on the evidence and the testimony of liv
ing witnesses appearing before the court.
The case was set for Wednesday of next
week, and will be decide! In a legal way.
Becker-Creegan Case.
When the Becker-Creejran case was
called In Judge Wallace's court yesterday
morning the District Attorney moved for
a continuance. Affidavits were presented
showing that time would be required to
bring; Joseph McClusker and Detective
Hamm out from the East, and upon the
showing Judge Wallace continued the
case until October 24.
The Cost of Freeing Cuba.
The United States are certainly entitled to
retain possession of the Philippine Islands if
the peace commissioners so decide, for the cost
of the war runs far into the millions, and the
end Is not yet. The money paid oot reaches an
astonishing total. To free the stomach, liver,
bowels and blood of disease, however, is not an
expenFive undertaking. A few dollars invented
In Hostetter's Stomach Bitters will accomplish
the task easily. Tho poor as well as the rich
can afford it.

DODGE CALLS A
HALT IN THE
PROCEEDINGS
Objects to the Garbage
Contract.
SUPERVISORS LAY IT OVER
BOTTANZI CALLS THE MAYOR A
DEMAGOGUE.
Many Matters of Interest Are At
tended to by the City Fathers
at Their Meeting Yes
terday.
The I?n.ird of Supervisors met yester
day and decided to wait awhile before
making a contract for the collection and
cremation of garbage.
Supervisor Dodge raised the objection
that a contract of the nature contem
plated would be pernicious, inasmuch as
it would fasten another monopoly upon
the city which it would be very difficult
in future to shake loose. He said that
there was no necessity for making- a con
tract ft>r the collection and incineration
of garbage for, a lump sumâ s3oo,ooo for
one year, as contemplated.
On motion of Supervisor Lackmann the
matter was laid over.
The next thins of importance was the
proposed letting of a year's contract to
P. Swift to supply the Street Depart
ment with lumber. His bid was much the
lowest, being Jii 73 per l'"." 1 for Oregon
pine and Sl2 74 por 1000 for redwood. The
only other bid was from the Union Pav
ing Company, wrueh wanted ?1S per 1000
feet for both kinds of lumber. Immedi
ate objection was raised by Supervisor
Rottanzl, who a.^ked if this wasn't the
same Swift who was being Investigated
by the Grand Jury in connection with the
School Board lumber steal. Mayor Phe
lan replied that it was the same indi
vidual.
"Then I move," said Rottanzi, "that
the matter be laid over until the Grand
Jury concludes its investigation." It was
so ordered.
A communication from the Mayor veto
ing an ordinance appropriating $24.>520
under two disputed contracts with the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Company
was read. This communication, which
was given in advance in )a;-t Sunday's
Call, scored Supervisor Rottanzl, as a
member of the board not entitled to hold
his position, owing to the fact that he
also held an army office.
Rottanzi replied to this charge by de
nomlating the Mayor as a demagogue. He
quoted a Supreme Court decision which
tended to show that Supervisor Rottanzi
and Army officer Rottanzi were both le
gally entitled to hold office.
Supervisor Britt arose to a question of
privilege and proceeded to roast th* 1 Ex
aminer for general untruthfulness, pau
city of Intellect, yellowness of eyesight
and general cussedness. The statements
were merely a repetition of well known
facts and therefore attracted but passing
notice. The Examiner had been lying
about Britt.
The clerk was instructed to advertise
for proposals for public printing in ac- j
cordance with specifications to be pre- i
pared.
The Market-street Railway Company
reported to the Supervisors that the |
gross receipts of the railroads formerly !
of the North Beach and Mission Railroad .
Company from August 1, 1896, to July 31,
1897, amounted to $260,298 36, and that said
gross receipts from August 1. 1897. to July
31, 1898, amounted to the sum of $279,
349 67.

SEVENTH LEAVES THURSDAY.
General Shaf ter Will Return to the
Command of This Department.
The Seventh California Regiment will
fold its tents for the last time on Thurs- i
day. The formal order for the departure
of "the regiment was issued from depart
ment headquarters yesterday. It is or
dered to rendezvous at Los Angeles,
where the colonel is Instructed to grant
the necessary furloughs. The regiment
will be furnished with two days' travel
rations and will go by way of the South
ern Pacilic.
Major John D. Miley of tho
First Infantry, aid and inspector general
upon the staff of Major General Shafter,
reached the city yesterday from the East.
He comes here for the purpose of arrang
ing some business matters and to take j
his family with him. Major Miley |
stated that while General Shafter was for j
the present temporarily assigned to the
department of the East, that he would be
sent here to assume command of this de
partment in a few months. General Shaf
tf-r has about a year more of service be
fore he has to retire, and the administra
tion will, no doubt, grant any wish that
he may have, and there is no doubt but
he may have, and there is no doubt
but that he desires to return here. Ma
jor Miley will return to the East next
Sunday.
First Lieutenant Cameron of the Fourth
Cavalry returned yesterday on the Ta
coma. The vessel only got as far as Hon
olulu when it was decided that it would
be impracticable to get her cargo of
horses to Manila. The water condensers
used for the purpose of providing water
for the horses proved not to have sufficient
capacity, and in consequence the animals
suffered greatly from thirst. These will
be enlarged and repaired before another
trip is attempted.
The Senator began coaling yesterday.
It is expected that she will be ready to
sail by the first of next week. No orders
have been formally issued assigning
troops to her, but it is almost certain that
she will carry the Third Battalion of the
Twenty-third Infantry, the Oregon re
cruits and Battery D of the California
Heavy Artillery. The Ohio and the
Valencia will be ready about the same
time, although according to the depot
quartermaster the Valencia will be ready
at the same time as the Senator. It is
thought that the First Washington will
bfl one of the first regiments sent away, i
It is understood that General Miller will j
go on the Newport, and that he will sail
just as soon as that vessel gets here and
can recoal.

MERCHANTS' ATHLETiC CLUB.
It Will Give a Boxing and Wrestling
Entertainment This Evening.
The Merchants' Athletic Club will pn
tc-rtaln Its members this evening with
an athletic programme consisting of box
ing and wrestling. Steve Vicine and Mau
rice L.ea will wrestle catch-as-catch-can,
best two out of three falls. Gene Mulli
gan and Jim Higgins and Jack McMa
hon and Charles Vickers will box three
round bouts. Mike Moliss and Frank Ely
will meet in a six-round contest. The main i
event will be an eight-round scrap for a
decision between Al Neil and Young Fitz
simmons, which promises to be quite in
teresting.
"Kid" Lavlgne remained over at Sag-
Inaw a few days to visit his parents, but
the managers of the National Club are
expecting to see him here at any time.
Lavlgne is a Very poor correspondent
since he parted with his old manager,
Sam Fitzpavrick, and doubtless he left his j
home in Sa^'inaw without a thought of
sending a dispatch to the National Club.
His opponent, Tom Tracey, is taking
matters easy In Aiameda until the ar
rival of Lavigne, when articles will be
signed for a twenty-round contest, which
will be held in the latter part of this
month.
Nothing new has been heard from Jim
Corbett since he telegraphed his brother
Harry to drop Jeffries off the list of his
prospective opponents. It is certain, how
ever, if the Eastern authorities will not
allow Corbett and McCoy to fight that a
contest between Corbett and Sharkey
will most assuredly be stopped. Sharkey
has telegraphed the National Club that
he will sign articles at any time to fight
Corbett In this city, but the ex-cham
pion has not yet found time to reply to
the offer of $15,000 which was made to
him a few weeks ago by the National
Club for a twenty-round fight with the
sailor.
â¢ NEAD AGAIN IN COURT.
The Mayor of Sioux City Seeds a Dis
patch to Mayor Phelan About
the Case.
John M. Nead, the Methodist exhort er
from Sioux City, charged with' vagraHcy,
appeared in Judge Conlan's court yester
day morning. His attorney made a mo
tion that the case be transferred to Judge
Low's court, as Judge Low had tried the
case of Nead's wife, but the Judge said
he would take the motion under advise
ment, and continued the case until to
morrow to be set for trial by a jury.
Nead received a dispatch yesterday af
ternoon from Mayor J. H. Quick of Sioux
City addressed to' Mayor Phelan. It read*
as follows: "Your police have doubtless
made a mistake in arresting J. M. Nead
and wife as vagrants. They were mem
bers of the First Methodist Church here
and in business up to within a few
months of their departure. They went
to engage in religious work. He has a
brother who has a bad reputation. That
is probably how the error was made."
Asthma, bronchitis, catarrh cure guarant'd. Dr.
Gordln, Sanitarium, f>l4 Pine, nr. Kearny. S.F. Cal.
The Mission Dolores Fair.
The fair and bazaar of the Mission Do
lores church, which is being held in
Mission Opera Hall, on Mission street,
between Seventeenth and Eighteenth, is
meeting with success beyond the expecta
tions of the promoters. The attendance
is Increasing each night, and the. attrac
tions are so varied as to continue the in
terest. The contest for the most popu
lar young lady of the parish is becom
ing very exciting, and the young ladles
are running very close. The fair will
close next Saturday evening. To the Rev.
Joseph Conway niuch of the success Is
due, owing to his untiring efforts.

LUMBERMEN
ENTER INTO
A COMBINE
Price Advanced $1 50
Per Thousand.
CONTROL THE PINE MARKET
NEW ASSOCIATION CALLED THE
LUMBER MANUFACTURERS
OF THE PACIFIC COAST.
Another Raise Looked For in the
Near Future â Redwood Dealers
May Join the Compact
Also.
There has been a sharp advance In the
price of lumber since last Saturday, and
the Indications are that the figures for
pine will go still higher In the near fu
ture.
Lumbermen have been complaining for
some time that there was no money in
the business owing to the sharp competi
tion in this and other coast markets.
Mills have been running at an actual
loss for some time, it is claimed, and
must continue to do so until the stocks
now on hand are exhausted unless some
steps could be taken to check the down
ward tendency of prices. It is estimated
that at the present time there is lumber
enough in stock to meet the demand for
nearly if not quite a year.
Dealers have been canvassing the situ
ation for some time, and last Saturday
afternoon definite action was taken when
a number of dealers met in the offices of
the Pacific Pine Lumber Company. 237
California street, at which an association
was formed and the name of the Lumber
Manufacturers cf the Pacific Coast was
adopted. J. H. Baxter presided over the
meeting and Frank Wan waa chosen
secretary of the new association.
The following linns were represented
and became members of the combine:
Btiznson Mill Company, Bellir.gham Bay
Land and Improvement Company, Ta
coma Mill Company, D. H. Bibb Lumber
Company, St. Paul and Tacoma Lumber
Company. Pope <Â£ Taibot. W. J. Adams,
S. E. S'.ade Lumber Company, Grays
Harbor Commercial Company. "Wilson
Brothers Jc Co.. Gardiner Mill Company,
Simpson Lumber Company.
The situation was discussed at length
and it was rir.ally decided to advance the
price of lumber from $? GO and $10 per M
to ill. cargo delivery, and a new price list
in accordar.ee with this raise was ordered
printed. The new schedule, It waa
claimed, would protect dealers from act
ual loss, though there was little or no
profit in 'umber even at that rate, so it Is
quite probable that before a great while
the association will order another ad
vance.
The dealers interested In the new asso
ciation.. It will be seen, are those who
control the pine market, but It Is expect
ed that the California redwood dealers
wiil enter the compact before long and
put \ip the price of that product corre
spondingly.

forth a peculiar story.
The plaintiff alleges that In ISTI. seven
years prior to the death of his father,
William R. Rulofson. a contract was en
tered into between his father and Hall
by which the plaintiff became the legally
adopted son of the latter. It was agreed
between the contractors that the plaintiff
was to be considered in ail respects en
titled to the rights usually accorded a
son, ard that he was to be the sole heir
to the estate of ais adopted father. The
plaintiff alleges that he kept his part of
the agreement faithfully ana always acted
os a dutiful son toward his adopted father
up to the time of his death. Hall died
and subsequently a will was f^ed dated
January . â  ls?T, but Kulofson was not
mentioned as a devisee. The entire estate
at the deceased was bequeathed to friends
and other relatives of the deceased. The
plaintiff alleges that Hall was insane
â when he made the will, and asks for a
decree of the court declaring him entitled
to the entire estate, as was agreed In the
contract of isn.
W; .s Tiled for Probate.
Tfc* will of William McUiughHn. who

"GIVE CHIEF

Disgraceful Wrangle
in the Botkin Case.
GOVERNOR'S WARRANT ISSUED
FIGHT OVER THE WORDING OF
THE STATE DOCUMENT.
The Extradition Matter Will Be
Transferred on Habeas Corpus
Into the Federal Court
To-Day.
There was a, parrot-and-monkey time in
the office of the Attorney General yester
day afternoon In which Chief of Police
Lees and George A. Knight, the attorney
for Mrs. Cordelia Botkin. furnished the
entertainment. The gray-haired Chief
and the silver-tongued orator from the
redwoods grew red of face an called
each other names that indicated that they
were not on the best of terms. in conse
quence of their difference of opinion on
points In the case mentioned.
A little after 2 o'clock Governor Budd.
Attorney Knight and F. Gowan for
the alleged poisoner of the women in Del
aware. Chief Lo^s, Detective McVey. from
the Eastern State. Assistant District At
torney Hosmer, besides other attorneys
and detectives, assembled in the rooms of
Attorney Genera! Fitzgerald. The Gov
ernor's purpose was to issue the warrant
for Mrs. Botkin's extradition In order
that her lawyers might sue out a writ of
habeas corpus and have the legal points
of the matter .tied by court.
The question to be determined was
whether or not Mrs. Botkin is a fugitive
from the Justice of the State of Dela
ware. The Governor had prepared two
warrants, to one of which he had at
tached the affidavit made In Delaware.
and upon which the Governor of that
State r.ad made his requisition. To the
other he proposed to attach all of the
papers submitted to him. It was the lat
ter "that was rir.ally issued. Before this
was reached there was a discussion aji-i
more talking was done than by a room
full of phonographs. Chief Lees was
smarting: under the insinuation that he
was watchir.tr for an opportunity to spirit
the won out of the State before her
attorneys couki prevent by legal methods
and he felt none too kindly toward
Knight, who was accredited with being
the author of the statement.
Lees lost no time in making the state- !
rr.ent that he wanted the case brought
before the courts on Us merits, and that :
he had no intention whatever of adopt- !
!r.g any underhanded methods to get the 1
woman out. of the jurisdiction of the State I
or courts. Kr.lght said that was exactly 'â 
what he wanted, and he disclaimed be- 'â 
ing the author of the remark that had
excited the Chiefs ire. This did not sat- )
Isfy the Chief, and many times he re- .
ferred to The matter that Irritated him.
and even accused the Governor of enter
tainlng some such idea. The discussion j
centered on the point as to whether or \
cot the Governor should recite in his Â«

Was .Made Park. Commissioner
Yesterday.
rp HE appointment of Albert "VT. Zeile to the vacancy created In the Park
I Commission by the expiration of the terra of Joseph Acs tin the Park
Commis&lOÃ by â  rm oi Joseph Austin was an
_L nounced yesterday by Governor Budd.
Mr. Zeiie's appointment is as extremely popular one. His active inter
est in all â alters pertaining to art. his, thorough training in business
arc! his education In the law have peculi&rSy fitted Mm for the important
o2Â« in which Governor** commission will place him, while the forty
two years that he has lived in Sax. Francisco have instilled in him a love
and trier- in the "people's playground" that will be a most potent in
centive to ths highest u?e of his abilities la the administration of Its affairs.
Mr. Zeile Is a native son and a graduate of the University of California
of the class of T5. Upon leavi-p the university he took a course of a Tear
and a half at the University of Leipsic, Germany, and returning to this
country, was graduated from the Columbia Law School of New York City.
Thoagii possessed of ac excellent ability ia the law. Mr. Zeile has
never practiced. Upon returning: to this city he took the. management of
the We Xcrth Point dock bonded warehouses, owned by his father, thÂ«
late D. 2<:le. He was later for four years secretary and treasurer of the
American Sugmr Refining Company and remained with that corporation un
til it was sold to the Havecaeyers. Since that time he baa been promi
nently associated with numerous large enterprise*, but haa given his
greater attention to the manasement cf his splendid ranch ta Brannan Isl
and, in the Sacramento River.
The new Park Commissioner is one cf the larsaat patrons of art In this
city. It was during his Poor years as president of the San Francisco Art
Association and '_â¢>:â - his initiative that Mr. Searies placed art en a firm
basis an* built himself a monument by mattir^ over to, the association
the Mark Hopkins residence oa California street.
The aypcintmect of Mr. Zetle was not actuated by any political consid

these who know him consider the Governor's action a reward of merit aad
a far step is the ri^nt direction.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1898.
DIDN'T OBEY
HIS CHILDREN
IX fie Biecle
papas sho vI d
bear in mind
that every well
regulated pa
rent is expected,
in these pro
gressive days,
to obey his or
her children. If
W. S. Chase had
famili a r i z c d
himself with tne
modernized ver
sion of the fifth
commandm c n t.
"Honor and obey your children." he
would be a happier man and the
second â woman who has the right to
call him husband might now rest
easily and quietly 'neath the Chase
roof.
An impartial observer might find
much to condone in Chase's particu
lar case, and in extenuation might
urge that in youthful days his chil
dren may have spared the rod and
spoiled the parent. However, the
fact, stubborn like all the rest of its
kind, remains, and no argument can
dispel the glaring truth that Chase
took unto himself a second wife
without obtaining the consent of any
of his seven children.
A little over a year ago Chase
went and did It. After the fateful
step had been taken, he and wifey
repaired to the family residence to
piead for forgiveness and gratefully
receive the hoped-for blessing. But
there were r.o pardons and no bene
dictions. Papa's home was closed to
papa, and he was obliged to take
his wife to other quarters.
For ten months the erring parent
lived under the severe displeasure of
his offspring, and then he attempted
what seemed to him a diplomatic
move. He left wifey under a foreign
roof and returned to the home of
his family, hoping by tender and
we!! - directed
persuasion to
have them kill
the fatted calf.
No calf, how
ever, came his
wftj-, and so on
Sunday last he
boldly inarched
up the front
steps of his res
idence at â  837
Castro stre c t
and demanded
hospitality for
himself and his
warrant that Mrs. Botkin had never been
physically In the State of Delaware. Hos
mer objected, giving as his reason that
he did not want the case to go before
the court with the facts therein having
been found and set forth by the Gover
nor of this State. Then came up the
proposition of the "fugitive from Justice"
clause. The Governor believed that
under the constitution It was a "con
structive" flight, if anything. To this
Knight objected, and the whole ground
was gone over again, even to the " re
hashing of the statement that Lees did
not intend to run away with the woman.
But the warrant was signed, as stated.
wife. Papa's de
m a n d was
laughed to
scorn. Frances
Chase, the eld
est daughter, a
young woman
o f about 36
summers, par
leyed through
the keyhole and
informed her
disobedient .pa
rent that he
might enter but
step mamma
could not.
Yesterday Chase carried his trou
bles to Judge Joachimsen and had
an interview with Warrant Cleric
Drury. who advocated arbitration,
and with that end in view wrote to
Miss Frances, asking her to call
upon him.
Out at the Castro-street house
Miss Frances and a younger sister
were on guard all day. Little Miss
Chase sat upon the front doorstep
armefi with a tremendous cotton um
brella, and just within the open door
sat Miss Frances. At the approach
of a reporter, who might have ap
preciated the difficulties attached to
the rearing of an obstreperous pa
rent. Miss Frances dropped the
drawbridge and locked herself In.
The keyhole that played so con
spicuous a role with papa and step
mamma was called into play and
the young lady hissed In dulcet ac
cent that she had nothing to say.
George M. Chase, dentist in the
Spring Valley building, eldest son of
a recreant father, also had nothing
to say. Chase Is a pretty man and
sets ftff to advantage his blue and
white duck Jacket with white "frog"
trimmings. While the tale of his
family troubles was being hastily
sketched to him. he stroked with
a lily-white hand his round
ed pink cheeks.
and then ho
said: "I'm not
seeking for no
toriety. I won't
tell you any
thing. Go ahead
and dig for
your story."
Warrant Clerk
Drury Is ex
pecting brilli
ant results as
the result of his
peace negotia
tions.
' .J^" came raore wrangling regarding
to whom the papers should be delivered
The proposition had been that as soon
as the Governor signed the -warrant the '
attorneys for Mrs - Botkin should apply!
~w the A Rl Â£ ed Sta:es Circuit Court for a i
writ of habeas corpus. By the time the i
discuss on was over the Federal offices i
j*cre closed for the day. Judge Hawiev i
rV& XTK T walt f d â  untn lon^ afte * * o'clock, i
Cfcie* Lees insisted that he should have j

Governor's hand. This is the worst kind
~, C^ I< f 4 play imaginable. His anxiety to I

Ch.ef was about to have an epileptic fit '

out, "Geortre Knight, if you say that I

laughing again, and li his softest tones j
be advanced and mockingly said: "I
â¢hould not have said what I did to the >
aged Chief. I should have had more con- !
sideration for his gray hairs. Governor,
you need not give the Chief a red rattie "
This speech made the Chief more angry,
if it was possible, and he said that he was
the equal, physically and mentaliv of
George a. Knight, to which the "latter â¢â 
smilingly agreed and wanted to shake }
hands with the still angry official, but the !
latter was in no mental condition to shake 1
any but his >valst .- little later It was }
decided to place all of the papers in the j
hands of Attorney General â Â» Fitxeerald. ?
who wlil hold them until 11 o'clock this
morning. By that hour the attorney's for
Mrs, Botkln will have dismissed the
habeas corpus case now pending in Su- j
perior Judge Cook's court. By that time j
also they will have perfected the papers
in the habeas corpus proceedings in trie
Federal Court, and as 'soon as this Is done
the Governor's warrant Will be delivered
to Chief Lees, and a United States Mar- '
fha! will i>erve upon the latter the papers !
In the habeas corpus proceedings in the i
Federal Court.
As may well be imagined, the Governor k
was highly disgusted with the nature and I
extent of the wracrling. and he dii not
hesitate to say so in" his usual blunt man
ner. _____^_____

ROTTANZI IS
OPPOSED TO
PAY-CUTTING
Never Drew Salary as
Captain.
GETS ONLY LIEUTENANT'S PAY
ACTING COMPTROLLER OF THE
TREASURY IS TO BLAME.
He Makes an Arbitrary Decision
That Materially Affects Captain
Rottanzi's Pocket and
v General Finances.
Captain Rottanzl, the gallant and deb
< onair surgeon of the Sixth California
i Regiment, has declared war against the
, acting Comptroller of the United States
Treasury. The captain has sworn a deep
| and direful oath. Nothing short of blood
i can satisfy his proud spirit and compen
sate him for the emptiness of his pock
ets. The gold that should be his, yea,
i the hard-earned, bright, clinking and
; Jingling coin of the realm, for which he
i braved death and the fortunes of war.
; are but as the memory of some departed
'. dream. To be exact, and in this case
the captain Is exact to a degree, there is
] $166 65 that he will never have the pleas
; ure of spending, or for that matter even
eeelng. No wonder the captain is
wroth, and it's no joke to his pride to
have to recall the fact that he has "been
done" b>* such an insignificant person
1 as the acting Comptroller of the Treas
ury.
Just because he was ten days late In
paying his respects to the paymaster
Captain Rottar.zi will receive only the
pay of a first lieutenant, when. If he had
got a hustle upon himself and inter
viewed the paymaster sooner, he would
at least have drawn two months of a
captains pay. These are the simple facts
in the case, back of which lie the arbitra
ry ruling of the acting Comptroller that
robbed the noble captain and caused him
to swear by the ancestral honor of the
house of Rotta.-zi that if ever he meets
the acting Comptroller there will be a
warm time and a dead comptroller.
The facts in the case, which no one
seems to clearly understand, are about
as follows:
All surgeons in the regular army under
the rank of major are known as assist
ant surgeon?. When they enter the ser
vice hey have to serve five years before
they get to be a captain. Now, when
many of the National Guard regiments
were accepted by '.: â  Government they
had a regimental system of rank that
was contrary to that prescribed by the
War Department, that is many of its sur
geons had rank that in the regular army
they would not have been entitled to.
However, the Secretary of AVar In ac
cepting the services of these assistant
surgeors allowed them to be commis
stoned as captains, and as such they were
paid nntil July M, when the acting Comp
troller in auditing the accounts of the
army suddenly thought of the army law
that an assistant surgeon must serve live
years before he can draw the pay of a :
captain, because he is not allowed to
hold that rank before that time.
The acting Comptroller is as arbitrary
as he i 3 powerful, and being amenable I
to no authority he immediately ruled
that the salary attaches to the office and
not to the rank of the incumbents of
these offices. Under this ruling all as
sistant surgeons with the rank of cap
tains will be paid as first lieutenants.
When the assistant surgeons of the
Seventh California Regiment were paid
last week they were tendered 1 J*s 65 in
stead of JIS3 6S. The amount held back
was the stoppage for the tare* months
that they have been overpaid since the
decision of the acting Comptroller. Cap
tain Rottar.zi is the worst sufferer of all.
Ke had the bad luck not to have any
dealings with the paymaster before July
23, and consequently his entire pay will
be only for the rank of a first lieuten
ant. Those surgeons ho were paid prior
to the decision of the acting Comptroller
have the benefit of the difference be
tween JISS 65 and 1123 23 for two months,
which is the difference between a cap
tain's and a Srst lieutenant's Mjr.
There is no redress from the decision
of the acting Comptroller except for him
to modify it himself. Even the Presi
dent is powerless, unless he remove the
Comptroller and appoint another. The
ruling of the treasury official is purely
arbitrary. Thus the matter rests at .
present and is likely to rest for ail time '
to come, as there Is Httle char.cÂ« of the
assistant surgeons being able to s"ttccess
fully combat the red tape which their
efforts for justice would meet with in
Washington.
Nevertheless. Captain Rottanzi â ?â _-â 
the acting Comptroller to know that he :
(Joes not like him and that he wIU neve*
consent to play in his back yard.
Took Rough on Bats.
Annie Neece. a servant of Mrs. Towna
at SflC Clay street, attempted suicide last
nSeht by taking rough or. rats. Miss
NÂ«we was walking down Steiner street.
between Pine and Bush, in company with
two soldiers, whose, names are unknown,
when she took the deadly dose. As soon
as she told th-em of what she bad <ione
they hurried her to Broemmell's drug
store at the comer of Ste'ner and Cali
fornia, where, after an hour's â¢-..â¢
physicians succeeded in arresting tha tc
tion of the poison and she was returned
to her home. No cause was assigned
fÂ»r her act.
To Master Out the Sixth-
The Sixth California ... Vol
unteers will to-day be paid oil for the
last month's soldiering and given a thirty
days' furlough. It is expected that by
the end of the thirty days mustering out
arrangement? will have been completed
and the regiment will then be dissolved.
About fifty of the men have preferred to
take their di^hartre now. though in do
in so they sacrifice a month's pay and
rations.

FRAWLEY'S GENTLE
REBUKE EFFECTIVE
THE BALDWIN PATBONS KEPT
THEIK SEATS.
f Those at the Columbia, Alcazar and
Comedy "Were Also Very Polite
and Sat Out the Play.
The action of Manager Frawley of the
Frawely company at the Baldwin last
Saturday night In gently rebuking that
; portion of the audience which began to
leave their seats before the end of the
final act, to the annoyance of those who
I desired to hear the last lines, had a very
! beneficial effect. This is indicated oy
the fact that at the performance last
evening' not a person arose till the cur- '
tain fell. This reception of the faint thus
given was highly gratifying not only to
the management and company, bat to the
large majority of those who were present
to enjoy the entertainment.
The publication of the story describing
the incident in yesterday's Call, with j
comments of managers. â  was *he means
of bringing about satisfactory results at
other playhouses.
At the Columbia, with few exceptions,
the audience kept their seats. Probabiy
the best illustration of the fact that the
public are willing to recognize the justice
of the new proposition was given at the
Alcazar, where notwithstanding the fact
that the play was not finished un.til
11:40. the entire audience remained seated
till the fall of the- curtain.
The big crowd at the Orpheurn was well
behaved, only a few following the old ob- i
jectionable habit.
At the Tlvoli the early-leaving contin
gent was not so considerate of the rights
of the majority, mar.y leaving during tne :
singing of the last number.
The patrons of the New Comedy !
Theater were, on the contrary, very polite.
The proposition to remain seated until
the fall of the last curtain was so favor
ably received on its first trial that It is
now believed by the managers that the
well-known fairness of San Francisco an- j
diences wiii within the course of a week j
result in the adoption generally of this
much desired rule.
