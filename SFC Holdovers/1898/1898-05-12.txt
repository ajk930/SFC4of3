REPORT THAT SPAIN'S FLEET HAS BEEN CRUSHED
NEW YORK, May 11 â¢â(From the London Telegraph correspondent, off Havana, via Key West, Fla*, Wednes
day*)âl was informed by the captain of the Vicksburg, when I hailed that vessel just after daybreak this morning, that
news had reached the blockading fleet of an action between Rear Admiral Sampson's squadron and the Spanish Cape Verde
fleet, east of Hayti, in which the latter had sustained a crushing defeat*
Whether there is any foundation for the report more than mere rumor, I cannot say, as I was unable to get a vessel
to take me to Porto Rican waters* If the action has been fought the details should reach you from St* Thomas or Jamaica
before they become known here*

PEOPLE OF SPAIN
CRYING FOR PEACE
A Membef of the Spanish Cabinet
Predicts That the End of the
-Var Is Very Near.
Every One, He Says, Is Desirous of Ending Hostili
ties, but None Are Brave Enough to
Speak First.
Copyrighted. 1898. hr Jam** Gordon Burnett.
MADRID, May â I have jurt had a
conversation with one of :he members
of the Cabinet, which may throw a true
light upon the workings of the Spanish
politicians at the present moment. He
said:
"A change in the Cabinet is bound to
come, and almost at once. In that
change Senor Moret will be first to go,
and with him those others who are not
popular tinder the present condition of
public sentiment."
"That means," I asked, "that more
energetic war measures will be inaug
urated?"
To my surprise he replied: "No, I
consider that any change which may
come will be in favor of peace. The
truth is. every one now at heart wishes
peace, but there are none brave enough
to speak first." .
"Do you think General Campos is the
coming man?" I asked.
"Well." he replied, somewhat hesitat
ingly, "I consider that by the middle of
next month General Campos will be in
power, and, although his will be a mili
tary government, it will be in favor of
peace."
I have just returned from a tour in the
provinces, and can most strongly affirm
that the Spanish people are weary of
war, of Cuba and of all trouble, ttagna
tion of trade, misery and starvation.
At Ageciras, an Englishman who lives
among the people told me they were
simply starving. There is no work and
no money. Bread has risen, as also all
other necessaries of life.
Here in Madrid nearly all places of
public entertainment are closed. The
Stock Exchange is at a standstill, and
ruin among persons of average means
is widespread. The streets are fuller
than ever of desperately hungry women,
crying for food for their starving chil
dren. Even the bull ring was half
empty last Sunday, and when that is the
case matters are indeed in extremes.
One of the most respectable brokers
in the country has committed suicide,
and tales of others being ruined are
heard constantly. Business on the
Stock Exchange is dull.
The Government keeps talking about
raising money which may be voted, but
where it is to be collected from no one
can say.
The Liberal fills three columns with
notices of riots from one end of Spain
to the other, and in three weeks it is
stated that there will be a bread famine
in Madrid.
Politics are in such a state that, as a
member of the Cabinet says: "What is
The San Francisco Call
most terrible is that absolutely no one
can well foresee what the future of this
country will be, for everything that is
worst is in view."
The so-much-talked-of national sub
scription amounted to nothing at all a
drop in the ocean, enough for a few
days' supplies if war were to be carried
on vigorously, not from any lack of
patriotism in the people, but simply be
cause they have not the cash to give.
In summing up its leading article
upon the condition of the country, the
Liberal says: "In addition to the trou
bles of the Antilles and the Philippines,
we are face to face with the necessity of
declaring martial law throughout Spain,
where discord, misery and exasperation
cry out at every door."
People are crying for food, not for
war. Of that I can assure you.

Delay.
General Merritt Will Com

Expedition.
Complete Conquest in the West

Two Weeks.
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, May EX.
The administration has perfected its plans for the vigorous prosecution of
the war against Spain along four important lines, namely, the reinforcement
of Admiral Dewey at Manila, the bombardment of San Juan and seizure of
Porto Rico by Admiral Sampson, the invasion of Cuba by a mighty army of
regulars and volunteers, and the shelling of Morro Castle and the other de
fenses of the doomed city of Havana.
The cruiser Charleston will leave San Francisco as soon after noon to
morrow as possible, and will carry supplies of provisions and at least 150 tons
of ammunition, including 500 rounds of eight-inch shells for the big guns of
the Olympia, 20,000 six-inch and 10,000 five-inch shells for the rifles of tha
smaller cruisers and an enormous quantity of powder, estimated at 170,000
pounds.
Following the Charleston as speedily as possible the troop ships will ba
pent, and at a late hour to-night the important announcement is made that
they will be commanded by General Wesley Merritt. who will bear a commis
sion from the President as the military governor of the Philippine Islands,
which he will hold until peace with Spain has been declared.
The second feature of the administration's programme â the bombardment
of Porto Rico â may ere this have been carried to a successful conclusion.
Admiral Sampson has been advised that the department believes the Spanish
fleet is still on the other side of the Atlantic, and hence there is no further
reason for delay in carrying out the instructions given for the reduction of
San Juan.
No credence is given the report cabled from Madrid to-night that tha
combined Spanish fleets have started for Manila to wrest the Philippines from
Dewey's grasp.
Reports have been current that Admiral Sampson has been instructed hi
abandon the operations against Porto Rico and return with all speed to Ha
vana. These rumors lack confirmation and are not accepted by the most ex
perienced observers for the reasons: First, that Sampson has been at great
pains to tow three powerful monitors to Porto Rico, which alone would bÂ«
easily equal to the task of compelling San Juan to capitulate, and which would
probably be left at that port should Sampson hurriedly return to Havana; and,
second, because the administration will not require the co-operation of tha
fleet in front of Havana within the next six or seven days, a period ample to
enable Sampson to return from Porto Rico after having fully accomplished hi*
mission there.
The third move planned by the Board of Strategy â the invasion of Cuba
has already been begun and will take definite shape on Monday or Tuesday
of next week, when the first transport will leave for the landing place on thÂ«
Cuban coast which has been decided upon.
As previously stated in these dispatches, General Shafter will personally
direct active operations in the field at the outset, but General Miles, with tha
enthusiasm and eagerness that has stimulated the whole army and inspired his
aids to wonderful activity, has decided to take command in person, and after
the troops have all been landed will make his headquarters on Cuban soil and
direct operations from his tent in the field.
The advance upon Havana will resemble a mighty wave in its resistless
force. Sixty thousand American troops, supported by the most powerful
artillery that can be put in the field, including all the latest engines of modern
warfare devised for field use, will move upon Havana, not laboriously through
swamps and morasses, but over a road to be built as the army progresses by
a corps of expert engineers under the superivsion of General Roy Stone, who
has been detailed from the Bureau of Roads by the Secretary of Agricultura
for this special service.
While this splendid army is marching on Havana from the rear the ad
ministration's fourth move will be made. The mighty Oregon, which has madÂ«
such a magnificent run from the Pacific, may fire the first gun at Morro Castle.
Racing up the South American coast, the big battleship to-night lies off Pern
ambuco, and in seven days can reach Havana, for which she is steaming at her
highest speed under orders from the Navy Department. A transport has been
sent to meet her in Cuban waters, carrying coal enough to fill her bunkers,
and 500 rounds of ammunition for her thirteen-inch rifles.
Unless Admiral Sampson starts from Porto Rico promptly the Oregon
will outstrip his fleet, and when the "invasion takes place will be the most
powerful vessel in front of Havana. Out of range of the Krapp guns on Morro
Castle, Captain Clark can throw his 1000-pound shells into Havana and drivo
Blanco and his forces upon the bayonets of the American army marching upon
the city from the rear.
In a fortnight the administration's plans will have been executed with tha
exception of the actual landing of reinforcements at Manila, and within a
month the stars and stripes will float over Manila, San Juan and the wreck o!
the Maine in the harbor of Havana.

BELKNAP ON
THE NAVAL
SITUATION
Believes Sampson's Orders
Were Similar to
Dewey's.
He Has No Doubt of Our Ability
to Reduce the Fortifications
In the West Indies.
BOSTON, May 11.â I am willing to
accept as true the London Globe's dis
patch which says that the Cape Verde
squadron has arrived at Cadiz. There
is little doubt that the ships have gone
there, and no doubt the Spaniards in
tend a united effort against our fleet.
Pending that attack I do not, of course,
know what will be done, for I know
nothing of the plans of the Navy De
partment.
Admiral Sampson, with his fleet of
powerful vessels, is approaching Porto
Rico, but what he will do when he gets
there depends gTeatly on what his or
ders were. My impression is that when
he sailed from Key West it was with
the understanding and belief that the
Spanish fleet was coming across the
ocean.
The Navy Department doubtless be
lieved that the fleet would go to Porto
Rico. Admiral Sanipson, I believe, was
ordered there with orders exactly sim
ilar to those which Commodore Dewey
received; that is, to destroy the Span
ish fleet and to capture Porto Rico. He
sailed prepared to do that, and I do
not think that he has been able to re
ceive news of the arrival of the Span
ish tleet at Cadiz. If he did not receive
this latter information, then what he
will now do depends greatly on what
his original orders were. If his orders
were to simply destroy the Spanish
fleet I do not think that he would at
tack Porto Rico. If they were to de
stroy the fleet and then capture Porto
Rico he will probably capture the place,
even though he does not meet with the
fleet.
As to the expediency of our fleets at
tacking Porto Rico and Havana now, I
should say that it was a question for
serious consideration. I believe that
the Spanish fleet will cross the ocean
to give us battle. If it does we should
be able to meet .t with our best and
strongest vessels.
A '.vise naval commander would not
persist in an attempt to capture either
Porto Rico or Havana, if he found that
the guns and the gunners were of
equal quality. That is. 1 do not believe
a prudent naval commander would
xisk his best ships to a firÂ«
that might reasonably be expect
ed to sink or disable them
when it is possible that power
ful Spanish ships were on the way
across the ocean. Therefore I believe
that Admiral Sampson will doubtless
make an attempt on the forts a^ Porto
Rico to see what' their strength is. If
they are not exceptionally strong, as j
they probably are not, and if the Span
ish gunnery is not any better than it !
was at Manila, he will probably reduce
the city and invr-Ft it when the army is
ready for occupation.
At Havana, doubtless, he will pro
ceed to do the same thing, when Porto
Kico is secure.
I would not be surprised if the re
ports were true that French and Ger
man gunners have reached Havana,
SCARCITY OF
PURE WATER
AT KEY WEST
Supply of the City Is Running
Low and Soon Will Be Eq
tirely Exhausted.
KEY WEST, May 11.â The water problem is getting serious at this
place. Naval officers recognize it, and they are looking anxiously
for the smoke from the stack of the big Government condenser which
is promised tc supply 40,000 gallons daily per contract. The plant
should have started on April 25, but it is not yet in operation. The of
ficers in charge of this station are skeptical of the condenser's abil
ity" to produce 20,000 gallons.
Key West's water resources are most primitive and limited. The
shallow wells in the town are all more or less brackish and under sus
picion of surface drainage. Two companies at various times have
driven artesian wells 1800 and 2300 feet deep, but they have never se
cured fresh water.
The town lives by cisterns and rain barrels. The cisterns, filled dur
ing the rainy season, usually run very low by the close of the dry sea
son, which is now due. This year, in addition to the rains coming
very late, the town has had its population doubled by the presence of
troops, shir>Â£< and war vessels and the army of newspaper correspond
ents and their tugs, which vessels take water by the thousand gallons,
not only for themselves, but for their boilers.
Of course the war vessels and some of the hospital and other craft
have condensers, but the draft on the town supply is still abnormal.
The torpedo-boats are without condensing apparatus, and they have
been scouting for fresh water as keenly as buccaneers after Spain's
galleons. Every discovery of a fresh cistern is hailed like a strike
in the Klondike, and every gallon of water has many purchasers, all
with money and anxious to outbid each other.
All who can afford it (that is to say, the newspaper correspondents
and the officers), drink bottled water, but a dearth of this supply Is
approaching. Most of the unpretentious brands of bottled water are
$1 a gallon, and "live" water is 15 cents a pint by the hundred bottles.
To make matters worse, the drug stores let their supply of water
run out before telegraphing for more, and there is a corner on water
between the grocery store, hotel and Cuban Club.
The Government reservoirs at the naval station, from which the en
gine-room is supplied, contain les* than 2000 gallons of water, and it ig
reported among the dispatch-boats that there is less than 1000 gallons of
rain water available in town, and this of a very poor quality.

CAPE VERDE FLEET.
Cruiser Harvard. Returns From a
Scouting Voyage of Several
Days' Duration.
ST. PIERRE, Martinique. May 11.â
The auxiliary cruiser Harvard arrived
at St. Pierre this evening at 10 o'clock
and anchored. Inquiries made of the
men on the cruiser brought out the
â¢tatement that she had not sighted the
i perhaps on the French steamer Lafay
i ette, and are ready to assist in the at
tack of pur vessels. If it is true, then
I we will have a chance for diplomatic
; action later on, though I do not think
I the matter is of eno-ugh importance to
: induce war between the United States
and France.
Advices state that Havana is de
; fended with Krupp guns. There are no
I better guns In the world than the
i Krupp. Ours are as good, but no bet
! ter. If these guns are properly handled
i at Havana (and it has always been ac
cepted as true that guns on shore are
of much greater effect than on ship
: board) Admiral Sampson may be con
vinced that he had better not attack
! Havana until he knows for certain the
i movements of the Spanish fleet.
There is no question of our ability to
j capture both Porto Rico and Havana.
! I do not believe the reports that Ha-
I vana has 100,000 Spanish soldiers. With
' the aid of the fleet, our army of 65,000
men could readily reduce and capture
Havana. But if Sampson should lose
j some of his best vessels in the fight,
j and the Spanish fleet should cross the
: ocean, it would make it troublesome for
him.
In the Philippines I see no change in
j the situation. Commodore Dewey has
> absolute control of the place, though I
, think he does not occupy more than the
Cavite battery and Corregidor Island
at the entrance of the bay, if, in fact,
he has that stronghold. When the
! troops arrive he will have no difficulty
; in taking possession of the city of Ma
! nila.
I anticipate no difficulty from the mi
i surgents. As for the European pow
ers, what can they do? Germany does
not look upon our victory with favor,
but England does. Besides, the Phll
: ippines are a conquest of war. The
nations have no right to interfere, and
if they do we will have England to
> stand beside us.
Dewey's victory, I must say, was a
most significant one. I believe no
| victory in the history of naval warfare
surpasses it. I knew that Dewey was
the man for the Asiatic station, and
when a new commander for the sta
; tion was under consideration I wrote
him that he was the man to take it.
| I do not credit the story that he did
! not want the command. Every naval
â¢ officer knows that out there the pros
' pect of lively times was present nearly
; all the time. The actions of Russia
! and France and Germany in grabbing
; parts of China made the situation in
: teresting.
I attribute the slight damage to the
: American fleet to the fact that the gun
| ners did not know how to shoot
â  straight. While they had Krupp guns
'â  they did not know how to use them.
! You know when they talk they shrug
their shoulders, which takes as much
part in their conversation as do their
tongues. Probably they stopped to
shrug their shoulders while aiming
their guns, plainly an unnecessary and
fatal maneuver.

CLIMATE MORE TO BE
FEARED THAN SPANIARDS
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
HONGKONG, May 11.â A rumor has been cabled here that 5000 Ameri
can troops were assembling at San Francisco for service in Manila. I Inter,
viewed to-day a gentleman familiar with the situation In the Philippines, who
says the United States could not do a more useless thing than to send a
small force of troops there.
"The plague," he says, "Is rampant at Canton and growing In virulence
at Hongkong, where more Europeans have been attacked this year than
ever before.
"The Manila climate will be the death or more than half of those sent
aut here inside of four months. Besides, they will be of little or no use.
Five thousand troops are not enough to take the field against the Spaniards,
If the latter are able to fight at all, and If the Spaniards are overwhelmed
by Insurgents the American soldiers are needed to do garrison work.
Hiat number would be absurdly Inadequate if the United States had the
idea of occupying the Philippines permanently. No troops should be sent
here until autumn, when not less than 25,000 men should be landed at
vianila. Unacclimatized recruits will die like Hies during the summer."

Stroog* Resolutions Adopted by the
Los Angeles Labor
Council.
LOS ANGELES, May 11.â At a meeting of the Los Angeles Labor
Council this evening tie following resolutions were unanimously
adopted :
Whereas, Danger is Â«â  pending in the threatened appointment of
Harrison Gray Otis as brigadier general of volunteers, Army of the
United States, by President William McKinley; therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the Labor Council of Los Angeles County, do
hereby protest against the appointment of said Harrison Gray Otis to
the said office of brigadier general of volunteers for the following rea
sons:
Firstâ That the said Otis is totally unfitted to hold the position in
that he is lacking in the necessary natural attainments; that to place
a person of his violent temper and strong prejudices over a brigade
of volunteer soldiers would be productive of most unfortunate results
to the soldiers of the brigade and to the country they were endeavoring
to serve.
Secondâ That Otis has for ten years been making a fight upon and
expressing his contempt for laboring men and has abused, vilified and
lied about them t : all times. As a brigade of soldiers will be made up
largely of workingmen the appointment of a person of Otis' well-known
and oft-expressed views of the men he would command would not ef
fect satisfactory results.
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be at once forwarfled
to the California delegation in Congress and that we do most earnest
ly petition the President not to name Otis, the labor crusher, as a
brigadier general of volunteers, and that a copy of these resolutions
also go to the "War Department.

quantity, one- fourth is to go to the

For some reason there appeared to be
a temporary check in ' the practical

wearers pay from $5 to $15 and even more, for truly there are places that sell
clothing for all they can get, rather than its real value. They call It all wool,
and it may be shoddy wool that has been ; used "over and over again," until it
has no real value; fades, turns gray, goes to pieces. We keep such clothing :.
and sell it at ?5, but do not encourage its sale while good clothing is so cheap.

doubts as to the accuracy of the report.
Tt was not possible during- the course
of the day to obtain anything like offi
cial- confirmation of the report
received yesterday, but this Is not to be
wondered at In -view of the success
which the Spanish Government has so
far met with In keeping secret the
movements of its naval ships.
Until news comes from Admiral
Sampson of his doings in and around
Porto Rico it cannot be said definitely
what programme shall be decided on
as regards that Island. It has been sug
gested that some of the troops now
being hurried so rapidly to the gulf
coast may be intended to co-operate
with Admiral Sampson in the reduction
of the fortifications at San Juan de
Porto Rico and the subsequent occupa
tion of the island. It is felt that the
admiral will be in a rather disagree
able plight, supposing even that he
managed to reduce the forts with his
fleet, if he were obliged to remain there
In occupation of the place for lack of
troops, when he might otherwise be
urgently needed either on the Cuban
coast or somewhere in the Atlantic to
meet the Spanish fleet.
An evidence of the wisdom of having
the troop transports near at hand in
such cases is shown by the predica-
ment Admiral Dewey Is believed to be
In at Manila, where, for lack of troops,
he Is unable to occupy the town and to
prevent atrocities which the insur
gents are capable of committing upon
their helpless Spanish foes.
The revival of doubts as to the
whereabouts of the Cape Verde squad
ron caused anxiety as to the Oregon.
The ship was at Bahia at last ac
counts, and she is believed to have
started a day or two ago up the Bra
zilian coast to join Sampson's squad
ron in the "West Indies. She will have
to make a run of 3000 miles, which will
occupy the Oregon about ten days only,
as she is in fine fettle and averaged
thirteen knots an hour on the long run
around from San Francisco. However,
It is believed that Admiral Sampson is
as well posted as any one in Washing
ton as to the conditions existing in the
West Indies, and he will doubtless do
whatever is necessary in his judgment
to safeguard the ship in her run up the
coast.
During the past month the bureau of
construction and repair of the Navy
Department spent one million and a
quarter dollars in the repair and out
fitting of ships, and none of this money
went to new construction. This is said
to be the largest expenditure in this
particular line made by the equipment
bureau, even during the days of the
Civil War.

Dewey Said to Have In
structions to Make a
Clean-Up.
No Vessel or Fortification of
Spain to Remain in the
Philippines.
NEW YORK, May 11.â The Herald's
"Washington correspondent telegraphs:
There is reason to believe that further
instructions sent Rear Admiral Dewey
via the dispatch boat McCulloch. which
returned to Manila from Hongkong, re
quired him to immediately destroy any
other vessels or fortifications which
Spain has in the Philippines.
"You must capture the vessels or de
stroy them," waa the direction given to
Rear Admiral Dewey before the battle
of Manila Bay. The instruction was due
to the desire of the authorities to re
move from the Pacific the Spanish fleet
and thus prevent the enemy from ha
rassing American commerce in those
waters. It is doubly necessary that it
should be carried out to the letter, in
view of the fact that troops will be sent
to the Philippines, with perhaps the
Bennington as their only convoy. It is
appreciated by the authorities that
Rear Admiral Dewey has destroyed
every Spanish vessel of any impor
tance in the far East, but it is admit
ted to be possible that Spain still has
among the islands some small gun
boats mounting one or two guns, which
it would be .vise to sink or capture.
As the Herald has stated, there are
also some antiquated fortifications at
Ilcilo and one or two other points,
which one cruiser could destroy with
out much difficulty. Probably one or
two of the vessels of his fleet are now
cruising among the Philippine Islands
engaged in reducing fortifications and
in destroying or capturing the enemy's
ships.
Under the orders issued to her the
cruiser Charleston will start for Ma
nila as soon as she takes on board the
extra supplies of ammunition designed
for the ships of the Asiatic squadron.
The Charleston will steam as fast as
possible, and it is expected that she
will salute Rear-Admiral Dewey's flag
twenty-five days after her departure
from San Francisco. By the attach
ment of the Charleston to the Asiatic
squadron the administration will sta
tion in the Phili^nine waters an effec
tive squadron of five protected cruisers,
two gunboats and one dispatch-boat.
It is possible that this fleet may be
increased by another gunboat, the Ben
nington. In accordance with the or
dera telegraphed to Mare Island navy
yard, the Pensacola will immediately
b<* placed in commission and she will
probably go to Honolulu in company
with the troop ships and remain at that
point with the Mohican for the pro
tection of American interests.

NEW YORK, May 11.â A Washington

There Is some talk of having the
Bennington, now in Hawaiian waters,
convoy troop ships from that point to
a certain point several hundred miles
from Manila, where the men-of-war of
Admiral Dewey's squadron will meet
them and give them safe conduct to
their destination. By this plan the
safety of the troops will be assured and
the Asiatic squadron would be rein
forced by another vessel without re
ducing the force in the Hawaiian and
Pacific Coast waters.
Of two-fold importance is the homing
of the Philippines and the stationing
of a sufficiently large force to defend
them. The first is the wresting from
Spain of a base which could be used
for operations against American com
merce and the Pacific Coast; and, sec
ond, the moral effect of retaining them
at least during the pendency of the
war.
It is appreciated that it Is out of the
question to consider that Spain will
send a force down the Atlantic, around
the Horn and up the Pacific to strike
the Pacific Slope cities. Her best
move would be to retake the Philip
pines, if possible, and from this point
make an offensive move against the
Hawaiian Islands, which, of course,
would suffer as the result of their ex
isting relations with this Government,
and employ these islands as a base
against the Pacific Coast.
Desiring to strengthen the defense
fleet of the Pacific Coast as much as
possible, the department recently or
dered Rear Admiral Miller to return
from Honolulu, and the department
has been informed of his safe arrival
at San Francisco. His flag Is now
probably flying on the coast defense
monitor Monterey, which is stationed
In San Francisco harbor as the guar
dian of that city.
There is no flagship on the Pacific
Const for Rear Admiral Miller, nor will
any be available before July 1, when
the Philadelphia will be placed in com
' mission. Besides the Monterey, Rear
Admiral Miller ha-s under his command
the Monadnock. protecting the cities ly
ing on Puget Sound; the gunboat
Wheeling, which has been ordered
south from Alaskan wators; the Alert,
â which is on her way to Mare Island
from Acapulro; five revenue cutters
and three tugs, which have been con
verted into men-of-war.
The authorities do not fear that Spain
will Fend h*>r fleet against the Pacific
Coast, but they desire to re-enforce the
Asiatic squadron as much as possible,
hence the orders to the Charleston to
sail with the utmost dispatch, and the
consideration of the proposition to- send
the Bennington to Manila.
ble. It Is now asserted that, while
there would be a substantial majority
for the annexation resolution, if it
could be brought to a vote, its oppon
ents are prepared to embark on a cam
paign of unlimited talk and prolong
the session of Congress indefinitely
rather than allow a vote to be reached.
In the meantime the administration
will go ahead with the plan of having
naval vessels, transports and supply
ships stop at the islands for coal and
supplies, and will make Honolulu the
base of their operations against Spain
In the Pacific.
BY POPULAR VOTE.
House Adopts the Resolution Re
garding Election of Senators.
WASHINGTON, May 11.â Aft*r re
fusing to-day, by a vote of 48 to 90, to
consider the Senate bill restricting im
migration, the House took up and de
voted the session to the House resolu
tion to submit to the States a proposi
tion to amend the constitution so as to
provide for the election of Senators by
a direct vote. The amendment, as pro
posed in the resolution reported to the
House, left it to the discretion of the
States to elect their Senators by direct
vote or through their Legislatures, but
an amendment by Underwood of Ala
bama, making selection by popular vote
mandatory, was adopted, and the reso
tion was then passed.
Loud called up the postoffice appro
priation bill as passed yesterday by the
Senate, and upon his motion the House
refused to concur to the Senate amend
ments, and asked a conference.

WHERE IS SPAIN'S
FLYING SQUADRON ?
Warning That the Enemy's Fleet
May Be Bound for the
Pacific.
Affection Induces a Spanish Lieutenant to Counsel
His Cousin in California to Leave the
Pacific Coast Forthwith.
Ever since the first definite indication of a conflict with Spain h has been
the endeavor of The Call to print the news without bias or color. It is in this
spirit a letter is presented this morning. It is from a Spanish officer to his
cousin, a resident of California. The recipient is a naturalized citizen who
openly proclaims his sympathy to be with the country of his adoption, and
makes the letter public only because he conceives such a course to be his plain
duty. It will be noted that the missive bears a date prior to a declaration of
war, but after such a declaration had been deemed certain. Many of its state
ments, which at the time might have been considered prophecy not likely of ful
fillment, have been proved by events to have been founded on an intimate
knowledge of the plans of the Spanish. In fact the scheme as outlined has
been so closely followed as to make the remaining part of it have a peculiar in
terest for the people of this coast.
There are rumors in plenty as to the location of the Spanish fleet. A corre
spondent who on former occasions has been thoroughly unreliable has pre
sumed to give information as to its whereabouts. Without corroborative evi
dence there is no imaginable reason for believing him. The manner in which
events have shaped themselves, as foretold by the Spaniard, gives sinister
weight to his predictions. The warning to his cou3in has every indication of
sincerity. That names are suppressed matters nothing, for the names are in
possession of this paper and are kept from the public for reasons the public will
appreciate. At the present writing there appears no insurmountable obstacle
to the coming of a Spanish fleet The fact that if such a fleet comes it will find
the Pacific Coast practically helpless, almost devoid of ships wherewith to make
defense, its one battleship on the Atlantic, is naturally considered.
The Call has made every effort to ascertain the real worth of the letter. It
has established beyond reasonable doubt that it was written in good faith by a
responsible man of excellent reputation. The document is given in full and to
every reader there is the privilege of judging for himself. The letter follows:
Sr. Don "-Dear Cousin: Without having heard anything from you
since I last wrote the present has for its object greetings to yourself and your
estimable family, and at the same time to say that I have just returned from
Madrid, where I went to see my brother Elias, who is also an officer in the
civil guard; and during my residence at the court I observed and heard a
number of officers of the navy and army speak in detail regarding the His
pano-Ameriean conflict. Great preparations have been made by this nation,
and It 1b believed that war is inevitable between the two countries.
Moreover, Spain has purchased several war vessels in these past few
days from France, Austria and Italy; but these purchases have been kept so
Becret that no one knows of them in this country up to the present time.
I was present at a conversation in the Hotel Continental between General
Martinez Campos, Admiral Bermejo, Minister of Marine, and a representa
tive of the Heraldo, who was called Sr. Don Jose Canalejas. Among other
things arose the question of the war between Spain and the United States,
and Admiral Bermejo said to Senor Campos and other officers that the first
naval campaign, according to the plans, would be a veritable surprise. Re
ferring to the Island of Cuba, he said that Spain was perfectly aware that
the United States intended to blockade the island, but that according to the
reports of General Campos and the butcher, Weyler (as they say in that
country), the island is perfectly fortified. It appears that it is not the plan
of Spain to send her fleet across the Atlantic while the blockade is on in
Cuba, but to unite it at Cape Verde (Portugal), Cadiz, Cartagena and the
Canaries; and to permit the American squadron, which they say is at Hong
kong, to attack the Philippine Islands, as Spain does not consider the fleet
In Asia of importance, but does so consider its fortifications.
According to Admiral Bermejo a division of cruisers will sail in an un
known direction, and there followed an animated discussion between the two
generals named as to the destination of the division. Campos was of the
opinion that it should be sent to the Pacific Coast through the Straits of
Magellan, and Bermejo by the Cape of Good Hope; and I believe that the
latter plan is the positive one.
It Is for -this that I warn you, with all my heart, because you live on
that coast with your family, not to confld< much in the security that you
will not be attacked when you least expect it. As you are the only one of
our family that is in that country- I tell you what is going to happen so that
you can retire to the Interior. It Is the idea in all of Spain to attack the
enemy in the Pacific and not to give battle of importance in the Atlantic.
Cousin, I was in Cadiz about two months ago and there was much ac
tivity in the secret department, where they have constructed the submarine
vessel Peral and other similar ones, which will be carried by the Pelayo,
Carlos Qulnto, Numancia and Vittoria, and an armored cruiser which certain
French bankers presented to Spain some time ago. They say there are seven
or eight of these submarine vessels, but no civilian is permitted to enter the
place.
I do not care to tell you more about this for fear that some Spanish au
thority will open my letter here, which would cost me as great a penalty as
to Captain Dreyfus in France. Until soon. Referring to your family, it if
about four months since I saw them. I had a letter from my father yes
terday and he says all are well. Elias is married in Madrid. For about eight
months I have been, as you know, in the civil guard of Asturias.
Without more and with expressions of regard for your family and your
self, receive the heart of your cousin, who loves you, and who wishes to see
you more than to write to you. And adios, cousin of my heart.
LIEUTENANT .
SPAIN BELIEVED TO
BE BLUFFING AGAIN
NEW YORK, May 11.â A dispatch to the World from Cadiz says:
The war and naval departments are advancing preparations for a re
lief expedition to the Philippines, which, it is said, will be composed of
8000 regular soldiers and two battalions of marines. Instructions have
been sent to General Augusti to hold out as long as possible, forty
days being required for the arrival of an expedition going by way of
the Suez canal and the Red Sea.
The commander of the frcruadron conveying the relief will be Ad
miral Butler, if Admiral Camera elects to remain in charge of the re
maining vessels of the reserve fleet.
A dispatch to the World from London says: Spain's reported
project of sending a relief expedition to the Philippines' is treated by
military and naval experts here as a mere bluff. In the first place
it is considered that the Spanish Government needs all the troops it
can muster to maintain the dynasty at home. Secondly, the reserve
squadron cannot possibly be ready for a month. Thirdly, there would
be the insupportable coal difficulty for the ships for a voyage of 8000
miles.
Some doubt is expressed whether Spain could send a relief expedi
tion through the Suez canal, but the World correspondent fnds that
the convention between the great powers concluded in 18S3 expressly
provides that the canal shall be open to ships of all nations In time

The question whether the Spanish fleet could coal at neutral ports
on the way to the Philippines raises a novel point of international
law, and if the fleet sails at all it Is believed that it will probably

CONFERENCE OF
SILVER FORCES
Leaders of Three Parties
Will Meet in San
Francisco.
Early Attempt to Be Made
to Pave the "Way for
Fusion.
Will Endeavor to Have the StÂ»tÂ«
Convention* Held on the
Sun* Day.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 11.â The con
ference committees which have been
named by the Democratic, Silver Re
publican and Populist State Central
Committees will hold a joint meeting
on Monday afternoon next at 2 o'clock
at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco.
Chairmen George W. Baker of the Sil
ver Republicr-- and E. M. Wardell of
the Populists have been notified of the
meeting and will give word to the
members of their respective commit
tees.
The object of the conference is to
pave the way to make a fusion of the
silver forces in the approaching State
campaign possible. This can be done
only by holding the State convention of
all three parties in the same city on
the same day. It is to arrrange for
the time and nlace of meeting of the
three conventions that the committee
will confer. It will have no power to
arrange any of the details of fusion,
as they will have to be fixed by the
delegates elected to the convention.
The Silver Republicans will be there
In force. National Committeeman Na
than Cole Jr. of this city favors a late
convention and a short campaign. He
will be in San Francisco on Monday
with Judge J. Noonan Phillips. Suther
land, Hutton and H. A. McCraney of
Sacramento.
An effort will be made to prevail upon
the Populists to change the time of
their State Convention from July 12 to
about August 15. If the Populists re
fuse fusion will have received its first
black eye.
ESCAPED THE WRECK
TO PERISH ON SHORE.
At Least One Man Survived the
Clara Nevada Disaster, Only
to Die of Exposure.
VICTORIA. B. C.\ Msiy 11.â A startling
discovery has just been made on the
shores of Lynn Canal by the steamer J.
M. Coleman, which plies between Juneau
and Skagway. A row boat bearing the
name of the unfortunate steamer Clara
Nevada was found high and dry on the
beach near Seward City, opposite where
the disaster occurred. The boat con
tained a couple of coats, two miners bags
full of clothing and a few provisions,
while a few feet away were the embers of
a camp tire.
AH this tends to show that at least one
man escaped the fate of the lost fifty,
and should he be found alive the. details
of the tragedy will cease to be a mys
tery. From the fact, however, that the
clothes and provisions were left in the
boat it seems that the survivors escaped
death in the explosion only to die from
exposure in the wilderness en shore. Had
they escaped they would undoubtedly
have gone back to the boat for the
clothes and food. Search parties have
started from Juneau to scour the woods
from the point where the discovery was
made, in the hope of finding the survivor
or survivors or securing information as
to their fate or identity.
As will be remembered, there were but
two witnesses of the catastropheâ Mr.
Beck and wife, residents of Seward City,
who were standing outside their cabin
scanning the sea when they saw the light
of a steamer beating against a heavy
gale. While they watched they heard a
muffled thud, a maps of flame illumined
the scene and the light of the vessel disap
peared from view. They watched for
nearly an hour, but never saw the steam
er again. Charred wreckage floated
ashoTe on the following day. and after a
short search the hull, bearing every indi
cation of an explosion having occurred,
was found by the steamer Rustler. But
one body was recovered, that of the
purser, notwithstanding that a thorough
search was made. The disaster was never
explained, and another vessel was record
ed as gone to the port of missing ships
with all on board, but in the light of re
cent discoveries, that may be learned of
the cause of the catastrophe and of the
lost passengers hitherto unknown.
FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS
OF THE LIQUOR LAW.
Marin County Community in Which
Strong Drink Is Sold Without
a License.
MTLLi VALLEY, May 11.â The citizens
of Eastland and vicinity are considerably
exercised over the flagrant manner in
which the law prohibiting the selling of
liquor without a license has been vio
lated, and some unscrupulous persons are
likely to find themselves the center of at
traction soon in a way not at all to their
liking. An anti-liquor ordinance has
never been thought necessary on account
of the fact that when the Tamalpais
Land and Ferry Company has sold any
land to incomers the purchaser has al
ways had to make a strict agreement in
writing that no intoxicating beverages
were to be sold on the premises. It is a
well-known fact, however, that these
agreements have in many cases been vio
lated, even where no license for the sale
of intoxicants has been procured.
One of the results of the sale of liquor
was seen here several evenings ago,
when a number of citizens witnessed a
furious encounter near the Mill Valley
depot between four or five men. Club's
were freely used and scalp wounds and
eyes in mourning served as evidence of
the worship paid King Alcohol. The mat
ter was brought to the attention of the
last Grand Jury, but no attention was
paid to it. Certain public spirited citizens
nave been at work lately quietly gather-
Ing evidence regarding a few dealers. The
County Board of Supervisors meets to
morrow at San Rafael, and to it an appeal
will doubtless be made for some method
of stopping the practice.
AT LEAST THREE LIVES
LOST IN A CONFLAGRATION.
Wholesale Toy and Fireworks Fac-
Tory Destroyed at Phila
delphia.
PHIL.ADET.PHIA, May 11.â Three per
sons are known to have lost their lives.
and it Is feared others may have perished
Jn a fire which originated in the wholesale
toy and fireworks establishment of Mc-
Cadden Bros., 619 Market street, about 11
o'clock to-day.
There were about 100 persons employed
in the McCadden store, and nearly all
managed to make their escape before the
names reached the upper stories. The
three bodies were found on the second
story of the burned structure. On ac
count of the inflammable nature of the
contents the big six-story structure was a
mass of flames in loss than half an hour.
The fire spread quickly to the building
on the east, occupied by the Reading
Hardware Company, and the big building
on the west, occupied jointly by the Na
tional Wall Paper Company and the
Brainerd & Armstrong Spool Silk Com
pany. The Fire Department sent in four
alarms, and in about an hour the fire was
under control.
The loss will reach about $500,000, well
covered by insurance.

ACCIDENT AT
CHILCOOT SLIDE
Three Klondikers Hurled
Down the Side of the
Mountain.
Sled Breaks Loose and Carries
Them to the Bottom of
the Canyon.
Unknown Traveler, Presumably
Confidence Man, Found Mur
dered on the Trail.
Special Dispatch to The Can.
TACOMA, May 11.â Three Klondik
ers were badly injured on April 30.
while descending from the summit of
Chilkoot Pass to Crater Lake. Two of
them were not expected to live when
Herman Knobel, who arrived to-day,
crossed the summit on the following
day. Knobel thinks all three were
Eastern men, but does not know their
names. They were moving their outfits
down the steep side of Chilkoot Pass
when a large, heavily laden sled broke
away from above and came crashing
into them. They lost their balance
completely and went down the
mountain side, the sleds passing over
them. One of the trio had both arms
and one leg broken. Another was in
jured internally and' remained uncon
scious all the next day. The third man's
leg was broken. Minor accidents of a
similar character have been numerous
during the rush over the passes.
Knobel brings news that an unknown
man, believed to be a confidence man,
was murdered a short distance below
Canyon City, on the Chilcoot trail, on
the night of April 30. His body waa
found next morning and taken to Can
! yon City. A bullet had entered the
i back of his head and come out at the
! throat. There was no indication of rob
! bery. At Canyon City it waa concluded
i that the man had attempted to victim
ize come tenderfoot, who had shot him.
Knobel left Lake Linderman on May
1, and spent the next three days on the
i trail and at Dyea. He reports that
' nothing was known on the trail of the
I reported drowning of twenty men by
falling through the ice near Lake Lin
! derman on May 2. He does not believe
the story and says it undoubtedly orig
: mated from the fact that on the day
i named two men and some horses broke
j through the ice in the canyon at the
south end of Lake Linderman. The
| water there was shallow, so the horses"
' feet quickly touched bottom. Men and
I animals got out.
Knobel heard of this occurrence In
I detail at Dyea and feels certain that
j no catastrophe occurred that day in
that locality.
Warm weather has made the ice and
snow very mushy between lakes Crater
! and Linderman. During the spring
break-up it is proposed to use a new
j trail on the side of the mountains, com
i ing out on the left side of Lake Linder
man, near its head. A bridge will be
built across the lake's headwaters to
the opposite side, whence the trail will
continue to Lake Bennett. .
Knobel, Banker Behrens and two
other Juneau men have landed fifty
tons of supplies at Lake Bennett,
where they are having four scows
1 built. They will start for Dawson

YOUTHFUL INCENDIARY
CONFESSES HIS CRIME
Attempt to Burn the Mount Tamal-
pais Military School Near
San Rafael.
SAN RAFAEL, May 11.â In the las*
week four fires have originated in the
Tamalpais Military Academy on Fifth
avenue and E street. The fact that they
were believed to be of incendiary origin
was kept quiet until yesterday, when,
a 19-year-old youth named Louis Turpin
was expelled from the school.
Young Turpin, who is a ward of Attor
ney J. Ward of Modesto, has confessed
to having tried to burn the school to the
ground. This fact will cause a decided
sensation, as Turpin by th^ death of hia
parents was recently left a. fortune of
about C 50.000. A few days ago the boy
was disciplined by being kept in after
Bcbool hours for an infraction of the
rules. Last Saturday evening he waa
seen loitering in the corridor by another
student, who shortly afterward discovered
a blaze in one of the rooms. This waa
promptly extinguished. Turpin said ha
had thrown a cigarette into the room.
Between Saturday and Monday he la
said to have threatened to burn the
building to the ground. On Monday night
n fire was discovered in the flueroom,
whore a large quantity of combustible
material had been stored. Principal Cros
by instituted a court of inquiry and Tur
pin was closely questioned. He finally
confessed the crime and was expelled yes-
terday.
Chief of the Fire Department Johansen
was investigating the matter to-day. It
is probable that the youthful incendiary
will be prosecuted for arson.
SKELETON FOUND IN
A CLUMP OF TULE.
Resident of Capay Valley Makes a
Gruesome Discovery Near the
Elkhorn Road.
WOODLAND. May 11.â William Par
ker of Capay Valley made a grewsome
find on the west side of the canal, a
short distance north of the Elkhorn
road, last Saturday. As he was driv
ing alone: he diseov^â - a pile of bones
in a clump of tule. The bones were
those of a man. They were all there
except the lower jaw and the bones of
the feet.
Mr. Parker also discovered some
clothing, including two h ts, two coata
and two pairs of trousers. There waa
no paper or other articles about the
clothing or on the grouna which would
furnish any clew to the identity of the
dead man.
When Mr. Parker arrived in Wood
land he notified Coroner Bean, who
went out, collected the bones and the
old clothing and brouerht them to this
city. The bones were buried in the
potter's field this afternoon.
jjTobody in Woodland remembers
that any Yolo County man has been
missing for two years, the time that
the bones evidently laLd in the tules,
and the mystery will probably never
be cleared up.

Admiral Merrhejo Denies
That Spain's Ships Re

American Naval Attache at Lon
don Is Inclined to Believe His
Statement.
LONDON, May 12.â A special dis
patch from Madrid says Admiral Ber
mejo, Minister of Marine, denies that
the Cape Verde squadron returned to
Cadiz. Bermejo says the fleet is now
where it ought to be, under orders.
The Globe published this afternoon a
dispatch from Cadiz, dated Saturday,
which said the following ships, which
were all ready for sea with the excep
tion of the Pelayo, were at that port:
Pelayo, Vittoria, Carlos V, Almirante
Oquendo, Viscaya, Maria Teresa, Cris

ARBITRATION
BILL ARGUED
Is Designed to Prevent
Railway Strikes in the
Future.
Senator Allen Questions the
Honest Purpose of the
Measure.
Declare* It Would Bind Employes
Hand and Foot to RÂ»ilroad
Corporations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 11.
For more than three hours this after
noon the Senate discussed what is
known as the railway arbitration bill,
a measure designed to adjust by means
of voluntary arbitration differences
that may artse between railroad offi
cials and their employes. Kyle of South
Dakota, in charge of the bill, offered
a number of amendments, which were
agreed to. In order to meet objections
raised to the measure, Hoar of Mas
sachusetts offered and amendment
which was accepted, providing that no
injunction should be issued wiiich
should compel the laborers against
their will to carry out any contract for
personal labor or service. The bill
was still under discussion when the
Senate adjourned.
When the consideration of the so
called railway arbitration bill was be
gun, Allen discussed it. He regarded
it, in its effects, as one of the most
viÂ«ious measures ever brought before
Congress. He declared that it bound
railroad employes hand and foot and
made them the bond servants of the
railroad corporations. He said that he
had been flooded with telegrams from
labor organizations, urging him to sup
port it. He thought, hawever, that the
railroad employes were being led into
a trap in urging the passage of the
bill.
Mr. Fairbanks of Indiana held that if
there were defects in the measure in
the very nature of the case they would
bear with equal hardships upon both
parties to any controversy that might
arise between the railroads and their
employes.
Mr. Ailen doubted the honest purpose
of the bill.
"If I were employed to defeat such
a purpose," said he, "I could not do it
better than in drafting a bill like this."
At the conclusion of Allen's speech
Kyle, in charge of the bill, offered and
had adopted many minor amendments.
One of these provided that not only
the award of the arbitrators, but also
the papers and proceedings, including
the testimony taken by them, shall be
filed with the clerk of the United States
District Court.
Another amendment provided that
nothing in the bill should prevent an

The Globe's correspondent added
that he believed the squadron would
Bail on Thursday (to-day), and said
a number of troops would, leave for
the Canary Islands on May 15, while
three battalions of marines were quar
tered at San Fernando ready for em
barkation.
Lieutenant Colwell, naval attache
of the United States Embassy, said to
day that he was by no means con
vinced that the Spanish Cape Verde
squadron is really at Cadiz.

employer from reducing the number of
employes if the exigencies of business
required such reduction.
A new section was offered as a sub
stitute for section 11 of the bill, pro
viding that each member of the arbi
tration board should recerve $10 a day
and expenses, and appropriating not
more than $5000 for each of the next
two years to pay the arbitrators and
expenses.
Hoar offered an amendment provid
ing that no injunction or other legal
process shall be issued which shall
compel the performance by any laborer
against his will of a contract for per
sonal labor or service. The amend
ment was accepted by Kyle, who gave
notice that he would move again to
morrow to resume consideration of the
measure.
WAR REVENUE BELL READY.
Committee Will Probably Report to
the Senate To-Day.
WASHINGTON, May 11.â With the
exception of a few administrative fea
tures the war revenue bill is ready for
report to the Senate. This report prob
ably will be made to-morrow, though
consideration of the measure will not
be begun before Monday. With the as
sistance of Senator Jones of Nevada
the Democrats had control of the Fi
nance Committee and adopted their
amendments, which include a corpora
tion tax of one-quarter of 1 per cent, a
provision for the coinage of the eeig
niorage and the issuanoe of $150,000,000
of greenbacks.
It required only a little more than an
hour for the committee to dispose of
the Democratic amendments. The vote
to strike out the bond feature stood 6
to 5, Jones of Nevada voting with the
Democrats. Senator Morrill (R.) and
Vest (D.) were paired. The amend
ments for the issuance of greenbacks,
the coinage of the silver seigniorage
and the taxation of corporations were
all incorporated by the same vote.
The Democrats changed their rate on
corporations at the last minute, reduc
ing it from one-half to one-quarter of
1 per cent. They made this reduction
because of the uncertainty as to the
amount of revenue the amendment
would produce. It was the generally
expressed opinion that the sum would,
even at this low percentage, be very
large, but there was no opportunity for
approximating the figure.
This provision is a very comprehen
sive one. It covers all corporations,
with a few exceptions, imposing a tax
of one-fourth of 1 per cent upon the
gross receipts. The exceptions are
charitable, educational, religious and
eleemosynary institutions and strictly
mutual benefit associations, which are
exempted, the exemption of mutual
concerns being made so as to include
only those which can loan money to
their own members. Building and loan
associations were exempted from the
operation of the bill, but the House pro
vision dealing with this matter was
changed and the language of the ex
emption in the Wilson-Gorman act
practically substituted for it.
There was some discussion of the
beer tax during the day, but it was de
cided to leave the matter as it passed
the House, with an increase of the re
bate from 5 to IVa per cent.

SACRAMENTO
IS AROUSED
Sees the Dangers Lurk
ing in Sewage-Tainted
Water.
Evening Bee Warns the People
Against a Spread of
Fever.
Arrest of Folsom's Warden Delayed
Through an Official's Ab
lence,
Special Dispatch to The C&IL
SACRAMENTO, May 11.â The con
tinued absence of the District Attorney
from the city has delayed the issuance
of a warrant for the arrest of Warden
Aull of Folsom prison, but In the
meantime the agitation of the sewage
problem grows, and it will certainly be
but a few days before relief will come
in one way or another.
Dr. Nichols, who has lived In Sacra
mento many years and is at present
secretary of the local Board of Health,
is in perfect accord with the general
sentiment which favors immediate
steps in the direction of protecting the I
people from the practices now in vogue
at the prison. He favors the proposi
tion to compel the authorities at the
prison to ceaÃe dumping their sewage
into the American River.
Warden Aull has already estimated
the expense of constructing a sewage
plant at Folsom, and in estimating the
cost in his report to the Governor, al
ready published in The Call, he placed
the figure at $15,000.
Should the Board of Prison Direct
ors make the request the State Board
of Examiners could allow a deficiency,
and the work of construction could be |
commenced and finished in a very
short time.
The warning first given by The Call
has thoroughly awakened the people of
Sacramento to the danger which
threatens them. To-nighfs Bee came
out in the following flaming headlines:
TYPHOID STILL, HOLDS ITS OWN.
Boil Tour Drinking Water, Citizens.
That Is the Surest Way to
Escape Infection.
Following this heading was the fol
lowing interview with one of Sacra
mento's most prominent physicians,
G. C. Simmons:
"You cannot urge upon the peoplÂ© too
strongly," said Dr. Simmons, "the ne
cessity of boiling every drop of their
drinking water. I don't care what brand
of a filter is used in a home, even the
filtered water must be boiled if it is de
sired to escape the danger of infection.
Several of my patients have told me that
they used no other water than that which
came through filters which were believed
to remove all germs.
"I see that the Board of Education is
putting filters in the public schools of the
city. That is all right, so far as making
the water clear is concerned; but if they
think they are thereby offering the pupils
perfectly pure water they are mistaken.
Every drop of water given to school chil
dren to drink should first be boiled, no
matter if it is proposed to filter it or not.
I repeat what I said a few weeks agoâ
our supply pipe should be at once extend
ed above the mouth of the American
River. This would at least insure us
against the impurities which are con
stantly being brought Into our river from
Folsom by means of the American.
"Those people who object to any out
side ownership of our water works cer
tainly should not find objection to any
such arrangement as I suggest, for it
would not involve the slightest change in
the present system of city ownership."
Dr. Simmons was asked if it were not
possible that many of the cases thought
to be typhoid fever might not in fact be
a form "of malarious fever.
"The cases," said Dr. Simmons, "are as
close to the typhoid type as we have in
this section. We seldom have the true
form of typhoid fever as it is known in
the East, where there are spots on the
flesh and other symptoms not apparent
here. Our typhoid has a mixture of ma
laria in it."
The Bee's comment on the situation
is as follows:
It is a fact that typhoid now exists in
this city to an extent justifying the most
careful measures on the part of house
holders to prevent its introduction into
their homes. The Bee has no desire what
ever to alarm the people when it calls
attention to the prevalence of this dis
ease. In fact, it Is beyond the power of
a newspaper to create alarm in the pre
mises, for the fact that there are very
many typhoid fever cases in this city is
known by the people themselves as thor
oughly as by the newspapers. .
WHY THE MONTSERRAT
RAN THE BLOCKADE.
Two American Warships "Were Hard
and Fast Upon a Coral Reef
at the Time.
NEW YORK, May 11.â One of. the
seamen on the United States cruiser
Marblehead has written an interesting
letter to his brother in this city and in
advertently it largely explains how it
became possible for the Montserrat to
run the blockade into Clenfuegos.
It appears from the letter that the
Marblehead, the gunboat Nashville and
the converted yacht Eagle were ordered
in company from Key West on a mis
sion unknown to the crew. On their
first day out the Marblehead and Eagle
both ran on a coral reef and stuck fast.
The Nashville doubtless tarried to help
them off, and all were a day or more
late arriving in Cienfuegos, whither
they were bound.
While the Marblehead and the Eagle
were straining aground the Montserrat
slipped in unknown to any of them, as
this passage from the seaman's letter
would Indicate:
"It was too bad we ran on a reef,
because if we had reached Cienfugos
a day sooner we would have captured
a Spanish transport with 800 troops on
board."
/In the light of this it seems probable
that this section of the fleet was as
signed to guard duty near the port of
Cienfuegos, and that Admiral Samp
son did not learn of their disability in
time to close the gap in the blockade
there.

HURRYING SUPPLIES ON
BOARD THE TRANSPORTS
Everything Possible Done to Facili
tate the Work at Port
Tampa.
TAMPA BAY HOTEL, Tampa, May
11.â Everything possible is being done
to facilitate the work of loading the
transports at Port Tampa with ammu
nition and supplies for the expedition.
All last night and all of to-day bodies
of men were kept busy unloading the
war material from the freight cars and
carefully stowing it away.
This part of the work will be practi
cally concluded by to-morrow night,
and the ships now in the slip will drop
anchor in the bay to make room for
other transports. The Orizaba is ex
pected up from quarantine to-morrow.
This is one of the largest transports
engaged by the Government and will be
used for carrying Infantry. A number
of Hotchkiss nuiSk firing and Gatling
guns were loaded on the Florida to
day. The big siege guns, four of which
have arrived here, have rot yet been
unloaded from the cars. They will be
loaded on some of the larger vessels,
probably the Alamo or Orizaba.
Lieutenant J. D. Miley of General
Shafter's staff, who was sent to Wash
ington Saturday with thÂ« reports of
Captain Dorst and Colonel Lauton and
the plans of the Cuban campaign re
turned to-day, bearinir with him a big
bundle of maps and documents, and im

It is now believed that the two Cuban
regiments will accompany the regular
troops to Cuba. They have all been
armed with Springfield rifles, and un

ITALY ON
THE VERGE
OF REVOLT
Riots at Milan Only Part of
a Concerted Plan of
Insurrection.
Belief in European Capitals That
the Uprising* Will Become
General.
LONDON, May 11.â The Italian col
ony is greatly excited by the reports
from Italy. Various statements are
circulated in the colony, alleged to be
based upon cipher telegrams. Accord
ing to one rumor on Monday night at
Naples a regiment flatly refused to
obey orders to fire on the people.
Father Bannin, one of the priests of
the Italian church in Hatton Garden,
London, says:
"We have been expecting a great
revolution for years, resulting from
the exorbitant taxation ground out of
the Italian people."
Reports by way of various continen
tal papers are beginning to arrive for
the London papers, fully confirming the
early reports of the extreme gravity of
the situation. The Times' correspond
ent explains that the bread issue is a
mere pretext for insurrection, prepared
beforehand by associations of navvies
and railway employes, in which a strong
socialist and republican leaven has long
| been working. He says:
"Besides many proofs of this state
ment, It will suffice to say that the riot
ing is confined to the richest districts
in the country. Another strong polit
ical motive underlying the movement is
the well-known desire of the Vatican
and the clericals to foment disorders,
hoping thereby to overthrow the house
of Savoy, in favor of a republic, which
might pave the way to a restoration of
the temporal power of the Pope."
The Rome correspondent of the Times
sends by mail a long dispatch which
the censor had refused to allow to be
transmitted by wire, practically con
firming the terrible nature of the riot
ing at Milan and elsewhere.
The Vienna correspondent of the
Daily Telegraph, describing the riots at
"One thousand persons were arrested,
600 killed and 2000 wounded. In one in
stance twenty students were killed at
the main station of the Viclno Rail
way line. Three hundred rioters set
fire to all the railway carriages and the
military, hurrying up, unfortunately
fired on the firemen who were trying to
i disperse the rioters with a hose. Many
I of the firemen were killed. As all print
ing houses in Milan refused to print
the manifesto the military government
j was proclaimed by drums and the roar
I of cannon."
The Daily News, commenting this
morning on the situation in Italy,
says: "We wish we could believe the
! whole of Italy tranquil. Our corre
1 spondents are unable to get their mes
i sages through, and if everything is so
tranquil it is strange that the Italian
Government should close up all the
j channels whereby such welcome news
': might spread."
ROME, May 12.â 1t will probably be
many days before one is able fully to
estimate the gravity of the riots and
the number of killed and wounded.
i The two suppressed papers, the Radi
cal Secolo and the Republican Italia
! del Popolo of Milan, were undoubtedly
chiefly responsible for the riots there.
The latter journal has been in the
habit for some years of giving its sub
scribers Christmas presents of revolv
ers and hatchets, the latter inscribed
in the Milanese dialect with the motto
"Dalli al Troncho" (Strike at the
The regular subscribers were largely
priests. It is said to-night that ail the
socialist papers throughout the coun
try have been, or will be, arrested and
detained until complete order is re
stored. Evidence accumulated that rail
way men were chiefly responsible for
the risings. The order calling them
under arms is expected to have a good
deterrent effect.
The military organ, Esercito, pub
lishes an order calling under arms the
reservists employed on the railways.
They are not to leave their employ
ment, but are to be under military law,
and thus prevent railway strikes and
agitation.
The Governor of Milan has issued a
decree declaring that persons found cy
cling in the province of Milan will be
Another decree prolongs to May 18
! bills falling due after May 8.
ROME, May 12.â At midnight a semi
! official note was issued asserting that
| "tranquillity" prevails throughout the
j kingdom." According to the same au
i thorlty the Russian Government has
i officially notified Italy that rumors of
j Russia's intention to prevent the cx
i port of cereals are unfounded.
Martial law has been proclaimed in
' the province of Como. There was riot
! ing yesterday at Novara in Piedmont.
i-A mob stoned the troops, who fired
' upon the rioters, injuring five of them.

DOUBTS THAT THE CAPE
VERDE FLEET IS AT CADIZ
Navy Department Not Ready to Be
lieve the Reports Sent From
Spain.
WASHINGTON, May 11.â The Navy
Department is In almost hourly expec- j
tation of advices from Admiral Samp- !
son. What the character of these ad- j
vices will be the officials do not inti- j
mate, but they expect Interesting and
important news. It is rather a matter
of surprise to them that the press has
! not already received information from
the squadron via St. Thomas and the
fleet dispatch-boats which accompany
Sampson's squadron. Notwithstanding
the cable advices to the effect that the
Spanish flying squadron has rejoined
the Spanish home squadron at Cadiz,
the naval strategy board is by no means
assured on this point, and it is believed
that while Admiral Sampson has been
placed in possession of the cable re
ports, he has been warned not to accept
them as absolutely conclusive as yet.
In this state of affairs the only prudent
course of action of the department
would seem to be to confer upon Ad
miral Sampson full authority to exer
cise his own discretion in his move
ments, and it Is believed this has been
done. A possible limitation was a re- i
quest that he hold himself in readiness
to furnish armed convoys for the troops
to- Cuba.
It might seem strange that the Navy
Department should be in doubt as to
whether or not a squadron of larg-e
men-of-war is lying in a harbor where
the ships would be plainly visible to the
eyes of 100,000 people. It must be re
membered, however, that the United
States has now no representative in
Cadiz, nor can it look to the represen
tatives of foreign governments in Spain
touching naval movements. Reliance
must be had either upon severely cen
sored newspaper dispatches or upon
the reports of spies, and neither of these
are of unimpeachable accuracy at this
Juncture. For this reason the Navy
Department is disposed to accept all
reports with extreme caution.

MILITARY DICTATORSHIP
IS NOT FAR DISTANT
A Number of Spanish Cities Have
Been Declared in a State
of Siege.

GIBRALTAR, May 11.â The principal
cities of Andalusia, such as Seville,
Malaga, Cordova, Almeria, Jaen, Huel
va, Algreciras and Marbella, have been
declared in a state of siege. As they
have had no riots at these places, it is
suspected that a military dictatorship
is not far distant.
MEN
I Who have any self-respect want to be
as bright as new dollars every morn-
ing. You are not, because you do not
sleep well. You are not beaming
with health and strength because
your nerves are weak. You are puny
when you ought to be strong. Air,
\ food and vitality were given you.
Then each helped to make life pleas-
ant. What is the truth now ? Some-
times you eat sparingly; sometimes
you can scarcely touch the best the
\ land affords. As for the vitality
which makes men equal to doing a big
day's work, you have none of it. Those
WHO
Are fond of fast living waste the
strength of vigor. They leave it de-
pleted. Those who work too hard
waste energy and get to be unable to
attend to neceesary duties. Those
who worry and fret at all times get
despondent. None of these should
occur. But if the faults have been
! committed "Hudyan" makes up for it
i all. Each class of folly makes weak
men. But "Hudyan" makes weak
men strong. It has made 20,000
strong men in this country alone, and
a host beside in the world. That is
the mission of "Hudyan," and in it
there is no failure. Never one in-
\ stance. Send for free circulars and

Merchants Give Freely
to the Growing
Fund.
Mfli Work in Prospect
' for the Society to .
Perform.
The fond collected by thÂ« Red Cross
Society up to the time the headquarters
of the organisation closed for the day yes
terday amounted to $5640, and promises
had been received for double that amount.
The officers of the society now are happy
In the thought that they are starting on
their work with a fairly good financial
backing. Before the next forty-eight
hours have passed they believe they will
be able to send off the California troops
fairly well equipped for Immediate hos
pital emergencies. The California boys
are not all that the society will be called
upon to provide for. Troops are coming
from Oregon, "Washington. Utah. Idaho,
Colorado, Kansas. Wyoming and Mon
tana, and their quota will amount to
about 8000 men. Their comforts will be
equally as much a care for the society as
those of the boys from this State, and
they cannot be allowed to leave the land
of their homes without being prepared for
a long siege of sickness in a foreign clime,
that Is almost sure to meet them. The
coming troops will probably not be so well
equipped as those from California, and
there la yet much work for the Red Cross
Society to do. Ten times the amount now
in the hands of the treasurer will have
to be raised, and the States contributing
the troops will be asked to assist in the
work of the organization. Then the work
will only be started. The men will go
away well prepared for the needed com
forts, but the supplies given them will
last only a short time, and perhaps, if
there should be an epidemic among them,
what they will have will only be a drop
In the bucket. The Government supplies
the bare necessities, and the men of the
troops look to the Red Cross Society to
prepare the comforts they will crave
should sickness overtake them
In addition to funds, contributions of
the needed hospital luxuries and neeessi
vill be asked for. Jellies and jams
dried and canned fruits, beef extracts and
similar nourishing foods, mushes and
stimulants are needed, and to-day a com
mittee will arrange for the establishment
of a warehouse for the reception of such
contributions. Such goods should be
packed for shipment on the transports
that will carry the soldiers away. One
wine merchant promised to donate wines
to the extent of $150 and give a cash con
tribution besides. Toomey & Casey, gro
cers at - J .o2y Sacramento street, sent a
; ining an assortment of jellies
and if>rr.s canned soups and beef tonic,
to the headquarters of the society yester
day, [t was the first contribution of the
kin>l received.

by President Hugh Craig, Irving

Rabbi Yoorsanger and Rev. Horatio Steb

his inability to be present through illness.
Mayor Phelan, who a few days ago gave
o the fund, doubled his subscription
at the meeting yesterday and his name
headed the roll that was circulated, and
he added the name of his mother. Mrs.
James Phelan, just under his own with a
subscription of $100. Irving M. Scott gave
ii virtual subscription of $100. and put
down another $100 for Mrs. Sfott and $50
for his daughter, Mrs. A. W. Brown.
Thon he added another $100 for the Union
Iron Works. The Marble Cutters' and

amount, at the solicitation of the young
lady, and her father increased it by $100.

tract visitors. Although every possible
and imaginable flower will be on exhibi
tion the rose will predominate and will

THEATRICAL ATTRACTIONS.
Notes of the Playbills and Concert
Programmes of the Current
Week.
Half of Ran Francisco, to judge by the
number of people that attended the re
, opening of the Orpheum last night, has
been deprived of its favorite amusement
for the past few days.
The Orpheum begins its week with an
interesting and a varied programme.
There are tireless dancers with the latest
and most difficult syncopated steps. There
are black-faced comedians, uglier, bigger
mouthed, thicker-headed than any that
ever trod the minstrel stage. There's a
Juggler who out-juggles all his dextrous
predecessors, who performs marvels of
balancing, and whose control over num
berless flying balls only hypnotism could
explain. There's a rubber-legged man
Or if he isn't, he ought to be. So wonder
fully and completely dislocated are his
limbs that there is nothing unnatural
that's beyond him. There's Mile Bartho
too. light, pretty and graceful, who is
none of these three in her second trans
formation, but who captures the house
and not only because thlÃ is war time and
the sight of the colors stirs a responsive
chord just nowâ when she dances like a
pretty bit of red, white and blue thistle
down at the last to the tune of "Yankee
Doodle.
At the Baldwin Pilar Morin plays "In
Old Japan" all this week. Scheel's or
chestra fills up, musically and artistically
the first half of the programme. The'
"Passion Play" continues every after
noon except Saturday at 3 o'clock.
Morosco's is filled nightly by a delight
ed crowd of people, who listen to "The
Prisoner of Algiers," a sequel to Monte
Cristo, and watch Jeffries box three
rounds with his brother.
"The Ensign" will be produced every

publishes an editorial calling upon the
French citizens of this city to contribute
funds for the Red Cross. It holds that
It is a duty of the French people, in view
of the fact that they are living in Amer
ica, to aid the Americans in every pos
sible way, and that they could do nothing
better than to give assistance, financial or
other, to those who may be called out to
defend the country's honor. It calls
upon all French people to assist in the
cause, and will receive subscriptions at
its office. It is proposed that the presi
dent of each French society sign a letter
which will be sent to each French citizen
in San Francisco, requesting him to par
ticipate In that work.
CALLS A MASS-MEETING.
Citizens of Oakland to Discuss
Red Cross Work on Sun
day.
OAKLAND, May 11.â The Red Cross So
ciety of this city to-day decided to hold
another mass-meeting Sunday. Taking a
lesson from the dispute among the minis
ters at the last meeting, the speakers will
be informed that no reference to the wis
dom or policy of the war will be tolerated,
but that they must confine themselves
strictly to the Red Cross work.
A letter from Surgeon General Middle
ton of the national society was read at to
day's meeting. He asks for sterilized
bandages, aluminum identification checks
to be worn around the soldiers' necks, and
money for any and all deficiencies. This
latter is likely to be needed in prepara
tion of ambulances and stretchers. There
is none of the former on the coast, and
but few of the latter.
All who have signed the enrollment
blanks up to this time have done so with
the understanding that there was no
initiation fees. That was correct, but
since its affiliation with the national so
ciety a fee of $1 must be collected. The
opportunity will be given to all who thus
desire to join in due time. The work will
probably be first publicly started Sunday,
but headquarters have been opened at
room 222. Central Bank building, where
any one may call and leave donations, en
roll or secure information.
AUSTRIANS WILL HELP.
The Verein Oesterreich to Hold
a Festival at the
Chutes.
The Verein Oesterreich, one of thÂ«
leading Austrian societies In this city,
has secured the Chutes for Saturday,
May 28, to hold a festival for the benefit
of the Red Cross Society of California,
and will spare no pains to insure a great
success.

ALL ON ACCOUNT OF A RAT.
A Rodent With an Eve for Beautu Tries
to Make a Meal of Miss Mollie
Gearu.
Miss Mollie Geary, the pretty sister of Congressman Geary, Is confined
to her rooms at the Hotel Falrmount suffering with nervous prostration.
The young lady Is a stenographer at the Mint, but It was not the. re
sponsibility of her position nor her close attention to duties that brought
on the attack.
A rat, with an eye to the beautifulâ in short, an artistic ratâ was the
cause of all the mischief.
Some six weeks ago Miss Geary's slumbers were rudely disturbed and
the young lady suddenly awakened by a sensation of pain across her fair
brow. Instinctively Miss Geary put her hand to her head and it came in
contact with a long, lean bodyâ the said mischief-making rat. The young
lady screamed. Sir Rat jumped awkwardly, with a dull, disagreeable thud,
to the floor, and without stopping for a formal leave-taking hied him to his
hole. The shock proved too much for the delicate, nervous organization of
the young lady, and she has since been confined to her bed. Miss Geary
is an interesting patient, and certainly a most attractive and beautiful one.
As she lies, with her copper-colored hair massed in artistic confusion
around her sweet, pale face, she makes so striking a picture that one Is
almost tempted to forgive the rat, realizing the tremendous temptation to
which he was exposed. Although on the high road to recovery, Miss
Geary is still extremely nervous. A creaking door makes her start, and
in her Imagination she sees rats hiding in all dark corners. A long rod is
at her bedside, and at every suspicious noise she pokes around, while mur
derous thoughts surge through her brain.
The rodent has paid the penalty of his heinous crime. A rattrap and
a dog assisted in the meting out of justice. There were no mourners at
the obsequies.
night this week, including Sunday, at the
California. In addition there are the
"Drummer Boy" of Shlloh and the great
Thomas Sharkey.
"Monbars" is on for all this week at
the Columbia, with Robert Mantell as
the hero.
This is the first week of "Ship Ahoy,"
which is billed for two weeks at the
Tivoll. Next Monday night will be Iri
quois Club night, when many of the club's
members will attend in a body.
"Niobe" is the attraction at the Alca

At the Chutes the animatoscope shows

it walked up Market street Saturday last.

Will Sing and Dance
in the Cause of
Mercy.
To-Day Is the Big Benefit
Entertainment at the
Orpheum.
This afternoon the Orpheum will be
dedicated to the Red Cross. The troupe
will sing Its sweetest and dance its pret
tiest and crack iv best and newest Jokes,
the blare of brass and the roll of drums
will rouse all the enthusiasm of a regi
ment on parade, and the lesson of pa
triotism and the tale of the little red em
blem of charity and mercy will be told
from the Btage by one who knows how
to tell it
It will bÂ« the first of the public enter
tainments to be given In aid of the Red
Crocs work and special efforts are being
made to make it a great source of en
couragement for the giving of other such
fillers of the society treasury. The whole
Orpheum troupe will take part, and In
addition there will be an address by
Rabbi Voorsanger, patriotic airs rendered
by the Venetian Ladies" Orchestra, some
patriotic songs by Maude Rockwell of the
Olympia Theater and music by the band
of the First California Volunteers. It
will be as varied a programme as has
ever been presented on the Orpheum
boards, and the reason for it all will lend
an interest not usually attached to the
work behind the footlights. Already the
sale of seats augurs well for the financial
port of the programme and the remainder
Is quite able to take care of itself.
The Orpheum orchestra, inspired by the
desire to aid the wounded, and confident
of the efficacy of harmony as a cure for
all ills, will lead the way for the per
formers. Hays and Bandy will danee â
together and "each by himself, and an en
core, too. If the audience demands and
the time will permit; Bogert and O'Brien
will wring reluctant music from tables
and chairs, plug hats and squawking
geese; John Ransome will transform him
self for the time being into Governor
Budd, and in the person of the executive
he will tell all he knows about the war;
"In Durance Vile," a little comedy skit,
will be presented by Isabelle Urquhart,
Sidney Wllmer and Walter Vincent;
George Fielding, the king of all jugglers,
will throw his bottles and hats and cups
and saucers higher than ever and will
balance on his nose or on his head every
thing he can pick up from his table, and
he may search through his properties for
more than one half-forgotten trick and
bring it forth into the glare of the foot
lights at the bidding of those who go to
see.
Gruet, Beers and Gruet, the eccentric,
grotesque and comic acrobats, will en
deavor to earn another adjective to help
them on the playbills; Mile. Bartho will
have an especially patriotic costume for
her dance, and Lizzie Raymond will have
a new song, tender enough to charm a
heart of stone.
Marion Kerner's "Visions of Art" will
end the programme, and he has promised
something particularly good for the finale.
All his best living pictures will be shown,
and then to end It all he will reproduce
"The Red Cross in the Field."
The programme will begin at 1:30 o'clock
and the doors will be opened the usual
length of time before. Already the seats
are selling rapidly and the success of the
entertainment Is almost assured even be
fore it commences.
The purpose of the entertainment will
be one of the themes of Rabbi Voorsan
ger's address. The story has been told
before, but it will not suffer in the re
telling, and besides there is so much to
tell. There is so little a soldier can do
for himself, anyway, even when he is
well and strong, that the thought of him
wounded and dying, not so much from his
injuries as from lack of care and atten
tion, is enough to bring something more
than a tear to the eye or a note of sorrow
and regret to the voice. It brings full
houses at benefit entertainments; It brings
enthusiasm in the work of mercy and
energy to those who direct it. ana it
brings money easily spared in the cause
of the scarlet emblem of mercy.

The eteamers Ohio and Connemaugh,
which arrived from the Eaat a few days
ago for the Klondike trade, have been
chartered by the Government, and will
carry soldiers and stores to Manila. The
Ohio can easily be fitted out for troops,
but the chances are that the Connemaugh
will be used as a storeship. The work of
discharging both of them was going on
with a rush all of yesterday, and the
chancea are that both of them will be
ready to go Into commission to-day.
The Australia was taken to the Union
Iron "Works yesterday and put on the
drydock. a gang of carpenters are at
work on her, putting up bunks and fitting
her up for the trip to the Philippines.
She will come off the drydock to-day, and
the work of coaling will begin as soon
as she is docked at Pacific-street wharf.
The work of discharging the City of
Peking was to have been finished Tuesday
night, but it was not until yesterday
evening that the work was completed.
The big steamer will be drydocked at
Hunters Point, and it will probably be
Tuesday next before she is ready to sail.
There was a change about in the officers
on the steamers City of Sydney and San
Jose yesterday. The Sydney is being
made ready" as quickly as possible to go
to the Philippines with troops, and as
Captain McLean and Chief Officer Kltt
would rather remain on the Central

to the San Jose. Captain Pillsbury and
Chief Officer Connors of the San Jose
will take the City of Sydney to Manila.
Admiral Miller raised his flag on the

The men on the Unadilla, the Mare

weeks they have been working nights lay
ing torpedoes in the harbor and about
the entrance. The work was not only
tedious but dangerous, and the men are
glad it is over. Only dark nights were j
chosen, and the Unadilla showed no lights
and dark lanterns only were used.
The schooner John D. Tallant was run
Into by the river steamer Modoc yesterday
and considerably damaged. She was to
have sailed for the Amoor River to-day
with a cargo valued at $95,397, but it will
take a couple of days to make the neces

steamer against the schooner with suf
ficient force to carry away the cathead :
and a considerable portion of the port j
railing, besides some of the bulwarks.
Henry Trattan was nearly killed on the !
British ship Port tÂ«gan yesterday. He |

head was cut, his companions decided to ;
take him to the Harbor Receiving Hos
pitaL Trattan walked from Green

badly bruised, besides receiving internal
injuries, yesterday. He was treated at
the Harbor Receiving Hospital.
The lighthouse inspector notifies marin

The bark Northern Light started for
Kotzebue Sound yesterday afternoon, but
was stopped off Meiggs wharf by the
revenue cutter Golden Gate. Owing to
passenger accommodation having been i
built on deck, the vessel's tonnage had i
been increased, and Captain Whiteside j
failed to notify the Custom-house of the
fact. It was proved to the satisfaction
of the Collector that the matter was an i
oversight, so the bark and her passengers
were allowed to proceed, and she will be
resurveyed upon her return.

DOBAN CENSURED.
Did Not Hire Mechanics for the Pa
vilion Work â A Settlement.
At a meeting of the District Council of
Corpenters and Joiners last night at 113314
Mission street the matter of responsi
bility for the recent catastrophe at the
Mechanics' Pavilion was taken up. After
receiving the report of Business Agent H.
M. Saunders it was decided that censure
be attached to Contractor Doran for not
having had the seats surrounding the
arena constructed by reliable mechanics.
The council exonerated the inspecting fire
marshal and recommended all architects
and business men to see that in the future
"all such work be given to a responsible
contractor, who thoroughly understands
such work." Contractor Doran's "greed"
and disregard for human nfe was severely
sco Ted by the council after hearing the
evidence submitted by Mr. Saunders.
Groom & Gibbs. managers of the recent
Sharkey-Jeffries fight, have decided that
the best thing they can do is to pay the
workmen hired as carpenters by Con
tractor Doran. who failed to give his em
ployes their dues. After the accident, the
breaking of the benches, Doran said that
he had no money. A number of the work
men complained to the .Labor Commis
sioner, who discussed the situation with
the managers, and they said they would
pay Doran's bills and take the amount
from the contract price. Yesterday twenty
of the men were paid and to-day the re
maining twenty will receive their dues.
The amount of each man is about $18.

Director Head Exposes the
Scheme by Which the
"Push" Profited.
Consideration of Bids for New Text
books Deferred Until Next
Wednesday.
The Board of Education omitted its
usual executive session prior to the regu
lar session yesterday. But the star-cham
ber proceedings were not entirely dis
pensed with. They were held the night
before, although Head. Derham and
Armer were not invited to attend. How
ever, if any jobs were hatched, they were
not sprung yesterday, even the school
book cinch going over till next week,
when a special session will be held. In
these days of Grand Jury investigations
and alert Judges the majority is "lying
mighty low."
It was generally conceded that Director
Waller would be the barometer by which
the justice of Judge Belcher'sproceedings
against the Grand Jury would be indicat
ed. The director usually keeps himself on
constant review during the sessions of
the board, and, if he exhibited unusual
exuberance yesterday. It would be taken
to indicate that the intimations in certain
quarters were justified that the Judge had
acted at the behest of the "push." A sub
dued spirit, it was said, would be proof
that Belcher's reasons for discharging
the Grand Jury were just.
Well, Waller was the most quiet mem
ber of the board. He only broke loose
once or twice, and then he quickly cap
tured himself.
The first matter taken up was the open
ing of bids for textbooks for drawing and
supplementary reading. A large number
of Eastern firms, as well as local publish
ers, put In bids, but so much opposition
was developed to saddling any more ex

pense upon the parents of school children
that the matter went over until next
Wednesday.
The finance committee reported a bill of
17100, the cost of taking the school census,
and recommended that it be paid.
Head objected. He said that the usual
cost of taking the census was $5000. Last
year that limit was exceeded by about
$600, and the board set aside $6000 for the
purpose this year. This was considered,
most liberal and the Marshal had prom
ised to keep within the limit. The extra
cost was due to the large number of men
employed, who, in order that work might
be found for them, went to some houses
three and even four times. One hundred
and six people had been employed by tha
Marshal, a larger force than ever used
before.
Waller tried to excuse the Increased
cost, and the majority accepted his ex
planation for the bill was ordered paid.

Waller tried to have all teachers on the
probationary list of the evening schools
prior to July 1, 1897. elected regular teach

a protest that it was referred to the com
mittee on qualifications.
Spoke to Socialists.
Henry Highton addressed a meeting In
the Turk-street Temple last evening on
"Standards of Integrity in the United
States." Like many others who have spo
ken before Liberty Branch lately ,Mr.
Highton is not a Socialist, but his views
on economic questions are such as to
please the audience immensely. His lec
ture last night was a tirade against the
way in which politics, political offices
and Senates and Legislatures are mani
pulated by political machines and bosses.
He said that the great majority of the
people are honest enough, but they allow
themselves to be carried away and their
rights trampled on by soulless politicians.

SACRAMENTO'S "OLD WOMON."
THERE is in Sacramento a well understood habit
of referring to the Record-Union as the "Old
Woman." That this title is an unmerited re
flection upon age and upon the sex we delight to
honor nobody who has experienced the sorrow of
reading that paper will think of denying. The Record-
Union is a senile old woman if a woman at all. Upon
its editorial page it showers the evidence of its dotage.
It has occasionally been led so far from the path of
intellectual integrity as to assail The Call.
The latest grievance of the Old Woman (we use
the term not with unqualified approval) is that this
paper has shown the water drank in Sacramento to
be unfit for such purpose. For having done so the
reward is a lack of appreciation amounting to actual
abuse. It has been necessary to demonstrate that the
water furnished the capital city is unfit for use, that
it contains the germs of fever, that the pollution
conies from a specific source. For having performed
a simple duty The Call is subjected to various
epithets. Yet every allegation it made in connection
with the matter is true, every warning based upon a
knowledge of the facts. The Record-Union is aware
of this. It admits the facts, but it objects to the cir
cumstance that a journal not printed there should
have presumed, for the good of Sacramento, to set
forth conditions which it was the bounden duty of
the Sacramento papers to set forth themselves.
In the article abusing The Call this Old Woman,
growing garrulous, seems unaware of the fact that
it admits every assertion among those which have
aroused its ire to be true. It even enlarges upon
them. For instance it says:
This city has two great, immediate and pressing
wantsâ a clear, pure water supply and completion of the
newer system, that the abominable cesspools may be
abandoned, and the storage of filth under the noses of
every household be done away with.
Until this people rise to the level of these"- great needs
and order them supplied, we must expect to be subject
to such smirching as the sensational press has given us.
We must expect cleanly people to speak ill of us; wo
must expect seasons of abnormal sickness, and when
pestilence comes into the State we must expect it to find
a congenial home among us.
Such is exactly the position taken by The Call, and
for having taken it the Old Woman abuses this paper
in the same article. Verily the Old Woman needs
looking after. Possibly she has indulged to excess
in catnip tea.
THE FEAT OF THE WINSLOW.
A GALLANT dash of the American torpedo boat
Winslow into Cardenas Bay on Monday
brought on a contest with three Spanish gun
boats, which resulted in another demonstration of the
superiority of the gunners of our navy over those in
the Spanish service. Though the Winslow was at one
time within 1500 yards of the gunboats she was never
touched by shot or shell, while, on the other hand,
her fire was so accurate that the enemy was compelled
to retire to the protection of the forts, carrying with
them one of their boats in a disabled condition.
In this contest the superiority of numbers and
weight of guns were overwhelmingly on the side of
the Spanish. A single gunboat ought to be more
than a match for a torpedo boat in a fight at long
range. Three gunboats against one torpedo boat was
therefore an instance in which the odds against the
torpedo boat were so great as to make the contest on
her part seem as one of bravado or desperate daring
rather than a well-considered feat of war.
The result showed, however, that the American
commander had not engaged in any foolish or reck
less adventure for the mere sake of showing valor
and winning a reputation. The Spaniards fired ac
curately enough at first, but imr ediately afterward
their shots were wild. According to the reports "they
seem to have been firing at the wide, wide world"
rather than at the little Winslow.
Very different was the fire of the American gunners.
The accuracy of their aim improved aa the fight went
on and they acquired a better knowledge of the range.
It is evident from this that the excitement of battle
and the presence of danger drives the Spaniard wild,
but steadies the American to his work and gives him
a precision of eye and hand he could hardly attain in
peaceful target practice.
This difference between the manhood of the crews
more than counterbalances any possible superiori - of
ships and guns the Spaniards might be able to bring
against an American fleet or ship during the war.
We can therefore await the result of every approach
ing contest with an even greater assurance of victory
than we have hitherto felt. The Spaniards may be
brave, and their* ships may be strong, but in these
days of long range guns neither courage nor strength
will avail a nation whose soldic s grow wild and lose
their heads at the very time they most need cool
brains, clear eyes and steady hands.
THE VICTORY OF MANILA BAY.
Q MERICAN fighters have always been noted
/ \ for the keenness and courage of their initia
* * tive. A British officer who watched the
storming of Chapultepec and the entry of Scott's
little army into the capital of Mexico said that in self
reliance, courage and initiative it had no equal in
military history. That final action of our war with
Mexico was commemorated forever. General Scott
levied a fine upon the City of Mexico which was used
in founding the Soldiers' Home at Georgetown, in
the Qistrict of Columbia, which is to this republic
what the Hotel dcs Invalides is to France.
It shelters the spent and homeless soldier in his old
age and perpetuates the memory of gallant action on
a foreign soil.
The American faculty of initiative has just been il
i lustrated again in the victory of Manila Bay. Dewey,
nearly 7000 miles away from his base of supplies,
with 2000 men under his command, the deck under
foot and sky overhead, sailed into a fortified port and,
moving between the fire of land batteries and that of
the enemy's fleet, poured hot broadsides into both
until the fleet was destroyed and the batteries were
silenced. The action in Caesar's military career
which stands most prominently in front in the his
tory of his campaigns was his initiative when engaged
in the siege of a walled city in GauL With all of
his force occupied with the enemy protected in his
front by strong and high walls, he was suddenly at
tacked in the rear by a superior force that had
marched to raise the siege. If he faced the new dan
ger a sally from the city would attack his rear. In
stantly he ordered a new formation by making his
army face both ways. The siege went on, and at the
same time the battle in the open fields was fought,
and the walls were breached at the moment th-s army
of relief surrendered. These land tactics were never
reproduced on the water until Dewey fought the land
batteries on one side and the fleet of Montijo on the
other and destroyed both.
Though the gallant action was 7000 miles away its
purpose was the defense of San Francisco. If
Montijo's fleet had survived it would have ravaged
our coasts and possibly this city might have been put
under tribute. In no part of the world was news of
the battle more anxiously awaited than here, and no
where did the flags ripple in the breeze with a higher
thrill than when every halyard shook its bunting out
in celebration of our delivery from danjer and in
honor of the victory of Manila Bay.
That victory should have lasting memorial here.
In this seaport city, where the wealth and commerce
of our Pacific Coast have ti.eir highest and most per
manent expression, there should be kept in everlast
ing memory this battle at the antipodes, fought and
won for us.
On the Spanish fleet are guns and armor enough to
build such a monument as will forever honor the
American navy and the commander and men who
have placed our self-reliant spirit and dashing initia
tive in advance of the world.
Let the transport ships which sail soon tor the
scene of this action in the far Philippines be directed
to bring back to San Francisco such guns and other
permanent material as may be desirable as trophies
from the Spanish fleet, to be wrought into a monu
ment that will tell forever the story of Dcwey's vic
tory.
AFTER THE WAR IS OVER.
IT was apparent in the beginning that the real bur
den of responsibility assumed by the United States
would appear after our account with Spain is
settled.
We have to do things during the war that impose
peculiar responsibility. The Spanish fleet in the Phil
ippines had to be sought out and destroyed to make
our Pacific Coast safe. But when we did it we de
stroyed Spain's power to protect ihe civilized people
of the Philippines from massacre by the insurgent
descendants of the Malay head-hunters. Talk about
a republic in those islands is like talk about a Sioux
or Apache republic in Dakota or Arizona. Not only
are those eight millions of mongrels ignorant of self
government, but they know nothing of any govern
ment and respect none except one strong enough to
restrain by force their disposition to murder and
rapine. They are Malays crossed on a half dozen
aboriginal tribes which were lower than any of our
red Indians, and this interesting result has been mixed
with Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish blood until
there are millions of mongrels who are at once the
despair of the ethnologist and the statesman. Sev
eral members of Congress speak of planting the stars
and stripes permanently over those people and extend
ing to them our institutions, and no doubt a strong
party will appear in advocacy of such an outcome.
The fitness of that people to receive our birthright
will have been tested, meantime. Their alertness in
regarding the overthrow of Spanish authority as in
tended to give them a chance to sack hospitals, steal
military stores and enter upon a career of loot and
murder should satisfy any one as to their fitness to
receive Anglo-Saxon institutions.
It is highly probable that when we land troops at
Manila these head-hunting savages will see in them
simply the representatives of orderly government
and will attack them as they have the Spanish forces.
In our ardor we are too apt to treat all revolutionists
as the analogues of our forefathers, who were English
gentlemen, trained in the science of government and
wise in the ways of legal order.
Turning from the Philippines to Cuba, we have
more of the mongrel class to deal with. Maceo, the
first insurgent chief, was a half-negro, and his suc
cessor, Gomez, is bred the same way. It is already
apparent that Gomez has great expectations. A few
days ago he stated the simple principle on which he
conducts his campaign by saying, "It is a war of ex
termination," and now he is reported to have notified
the President that our troops should not be landed in
Cuba, but that we should furnish him with arms and
ammunition â of course to continue his war of exter
mination. It will be necessary to teach Gomez and
Aguinaldo, the Philippine rebel general, that we are
not engaged in the business of furnishing savages the
means of carrying on a war of extermination. We
have set out to do an unpleasant duly in the case of
Spain, and when that is done we may have upon our
hands the task of exterminating the Cuba exterminat
ors and quelling the Philippine head-hunters.
The Denver man who threw a stone into a can of
nitro-glycerine for the fun of seeing an explosion did
not remain in the vicinity long enough to fully grasp
the impressiveness of the merriment he was creating.
The Coroner, however, is conscientiously trying to
find him.
Dewey is being praised by the English press. We
sometimes quarrel with our British friends, but it
must be acknowledged that they do like a fighter.
Aside from being another style of cutthroats, the
Philippine insurgents seem to be about of a piece with
their oooressor*
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 12, 1898.
FINANCES OF TrjE CHARTER.
AFEW days ago The Call published a financial
statement compiled by Auditor Broderick, m
which it was shown by figures that the pro
posed charter, unless the limit on taxation is sus
pended, will create a deficit of $1,121,788 the first
year it is put in operation. The answer of the char
ter organ to this is that the Auditor's figures are
"misleading" and inspired by the sugar trust. No
attempt is made to refute Mr. Broderick's conclusions
norâ except in a few immaterial instances â to modify
his estimates. The charter organ relies entirely upon
its allegation that the Auditor is an enemy of good
government and working with the sugar trust to
prevent the creation of a Czar Mayoi in San Fran
cisco.
Yet it is susceptible of proof that the Auditor's es
timates of increased expenditures under the charter
are exceedingly modest. He figures that the increase
in the Board of Public Works, which is designed to
succeed the Street Department system, will amount
to but $65,000 annually. The charter organ says
"the only salaries fixed in this department are $12,000
for the three Commissioners and $1800 for the sec
retary." And then it adds: "The compensation of
all other officials in the department is fixed by the
Commissioners, but the total is absolutely fixed by
the charter not to exceed the amount to be appro
priated by the Supervisors."
Here, then, is the joker. The Board of Public
Works may fix the salaries of the clerks, superin
tendents, inspectors, engineers, surveyors, deputies,
architects and workmen whom it is authorized to
employ under section 3 of chapter 1, article VI. The
only check upon its expenditures for this purpose is
the forbearance of the Supervisors. How would this
forbearance be expanded, after the adoption of the
charter, if the Board of Public Works should pro
pose to let the Supervisors name about half its em
ployes? It is notorious that discretion as to fixing
salaries always results in high salaries. Take the
present Board of Health, for instance. Its statutory
inspectors receive $100 a month; its additional in
spectors, whose salaries are fixed by the board, $200.
It is safe to say that under the system outlined
$250,000 would not meet the increased requirements
of the proposed Board of Public Works.
The Auditor's statement shows that there are upon
the face of the proposed charter increased expendi
tures amounting to $750,400, and decreases amount
ing to $156,965â a net increase of $593-435- Unless
there is an increase in the value of real and personal
property beyond what the Assessor now returns as
its cost value there can be raised under the charter by
taxation only about $3,460,000. The revenue from other
sources will yield not over $1,300,000. Adding an
appropriation for the parks of $242,200 and $60,000
for the interest account and sinking funds, and the
amount that can be raised under the charter for con
ducting the government is $5,062,200. The appropria
tions for the year 1897-98 aggregate $5,490,553 Add
to this the estimated deficit for this year, $100,000,
and the net increases provided for by the charter,
$593,435, and the total amount required is $6,183,988.
There will be, therefore, unless the charter limit is
suspended, an annual deficit of $1,121,788. This is
not taking into account the salary fixing abilities of
a Board of Public Works in combination with a
Czar Mayor and a hungry ring of Supervisors.
These figures cannot be dismissed with light and

THE LOS ANGELES WATER FIGHT.
ALTHOUGH less than ninety days remain for
the Councilmen of Los Angeles to arrange for
the purchase of the improvements of the water
company and thus regain for the city the valuable
water rights leased out for a song in the days when
Los Angeles was a hamlet, next to nothing has been
done to accomplish that purpose. Up to this time the
water company has not even made a statement of the
value of its improvements, and until that is done
everything else must wait.
By way of making at least a pretense at recovering
the property, the Council at its last meeting passed
a resolution demanding a statement from the com
pany. Such a resolution has a businesslike sound,
but then equally strong and full sounding resolutions
have been passed before. The water company has ig
nored those of the past, and it is a fair assumption it
will ignore this one also. Something more than a
formal resolution of demand will be necessary to
bring that cunning corporation to time.
The game now being played by the water company
in Los Angeles is the boldest that has ever yet been
put up by a water company anywhere in California
to enrich itself at the expense of the people. The feat
recently accomplished by which water rates were
raised in Oakland is one of mild-mannered modesty
in comparison with the grab in the City of Angels.
The Oakland water companies own the property out
of which they are to make exorbitant rates, but the
Los Angeles corporation aims to rob the people not
only by high rates, but of the water property itself.
It is high time for the people of Los Angeles to
bestir themselves in defense of their property and
rights. The Councilmen may be well meaning, but
they are certainly not acting with the force required
to baffle the greedy and unscrupulous men who are
planning to hold the leased water rights as if they
were private property. Ninety days is a short time
in which to make estimates of the company's im
provements and arrange for purchasing them.
The company has been fighting for delay all along
and will continue such tactics to the end, for to it
delay means victory. The people must move in or
der to win. The Council having now passer! ence
more the usual resolution demanding a statement
from the company, the people should see t<s it that
this time the resolution has vigor behind it and that
the demand is enforced.
Only a few days ago a learned contemporary ex
plained and extolled the wisdom of the Government
in not giving Captain Sigsbee a new command. Mean
time Captain Sigsbee is on the high seas as com
mander of the St. Paul, a circumstance showing that
either the Government or the contemporary needs
a guardian.
Neither did Secretary Long waste any words in

shows that they were about right in other respects.

Adjutant Gen
eral Barrett told
a good story at
the banquet giv
en to the Cali
fornia Volunteers
Tuesday night.
The time was
PLAYED
THE
SAME GAME.
during the civil war, the place the siege
of Vicksburg, and the chief actor the
general himself, who at that time was a
private in the Bervlce of the Union army.
It was at dead of night, and both ar
mies were encamped within a short dis
tance of each other, and although hostili
ties had temporarily ceased the crack of
a rifle from the sharpshooters on the op
posing sides resounded now and then, and
the intense darkness did not always in
terfere with the unerring accuracy of the
death dealers.
About 1 o'clock in the morning Private
Barrett happened to espy a dead tree at
a distance of 800 feet from his camp, and
the thought of what a beautiful vantage
place to kill off some rebels from behind
that fallen log when the dawn would ap
pear flashed through his brain. He im
mediately proceeded to carry his idea
into effect, and with his rifle he cautious
ly approached the defunct tree. The dan
ger of this act must be apparent when it
is known that even the rustle of a leaf
would attract the deadly aim of a score
of sharpshooters, but Barrett was young
and full of an ambitious desire to "pick
off" a few "Johnnies" in return for simi
lar compliments extended to some of his
unfortunate companions. He had crept
on all-fours to within about fifty feet of
his objective point when he stopped to
put a chew of tobacco in his mouth, prob
ably to give him more courage. This lit
tle act, insignificant as it may seem, no
doubt saved his life, for at that moment,
in the stillness of the night he heard a
voice from behind the fallen tree say,
"Won't we give those Yankees fits in the
morning?" Two of the rebels had con
ceived the same idea as Barrett and were
there before him. The moment was a
critical one, but Barrett's nerve was with
him and he quietly retraced his steps and
breathed a sigh of relief when he was
safe on his own ground once more.
As soon as dawn appeared two "John
nies" were sent to the great beyond by
the bullets of fifty rifles simultaneously
leveled at them by the same number of
Yankee sharpshooters, many of whom are
alive to-day simply because Barrett
chewed tobacco on that eventful night.

Editor of the San Francisco Call: Nei
ther sleeping nor dead is the Woman's
Corps Auxiliary to the Grand Army of the

way preferring to make practical demon
stration that it's work, not words, that
tells. As we have worked for the poor,
the maimed soldiers of our last civil war
and their families, even at this late date
having more calls upon our charity than
ever (as they are all more advanced in
years); as we have tended to their tem
poral comforts and have given our sym
pathy in their spiritual needs, so stand we
all now, thousands of patriotic women
auxiliary to the G. A. R., ready to do all
In our power for Old Glory and its de
fenders "on land or sea, by sea or shore"
âcommand and we obey. We, the moth
ers; do you think? We, who gave of our
bodies to your life; we. who nursed you in
childhood; we, who noted the first growth
of your soul; we, who stand ready in sick
neaa or in health; we, who take you for
better or for worse; we, who smooth your
pillow in babyhood, who worship and love
you in manhood; we, who minister to you
In failing health, until at last parted by
death still strew flowers upon your grave.
Dd you think? Now again, in this coming

who for tweny-flve years have been faith
ful, even in little things, that now we for

"and it shall be given you." Do not fail
when noting the grand offers of limb and
life, given by our sons, brothers, hus
bands, fathers to remember the sacrifices,
the grand reserve force, the soothing un
der current, the great motive power, that
wonderful element, that grand, Btrong
force for good, the mother love "deep,
deep as the sea and as white as its
foam." Many know it to be, and some
are still "entertaining angels unawares."
Be that as it may, our record in the past
as auxiliary to the G. A. R. proves the
statement correct that when the hour
strikes and honor calls we are ready to

full asurance that our cause is just, and
that "truth is mighty and must prevail."

GOD BLESS THE YANKEE TAR.
Oh! see our Yankee sailor, with Havana on his
knee !
He Is nursing little Cuba and soon will make
her free ;
He has heard her cry for Freedom, as It rolled
across the sea.
For peace upon her shores.
He has heard the clank of fetters, locked by
cruel parent Spain,
Upon the souls of little ones, who wrlth* In
mortal pain;
Who, famished, gaunt, with bloodless lips,
mark the wake of Weyler's train,
As he marched across the sea.
He has heard the groans of weary men, op
pressed, faint and sore.
Who have labored on without reward to fill
the tyrant's store.
While Spain looked on with haughty mien, de
manding more and more,
80 great her lust for greed.
He has heard the praters of women as they
cried to God for bread,
For the babes they to their bosoms pressed,
tho' long since cold and dead;
He has heard their death cry bitter, as the
coward's bullets sped.
Even women to destroy.
He has girded on his armor and has sailed
across the sea.
While before his mighty Ironclad proud Span
ish vessels flee;
"Cuba Libre" is hla watchword and his cannon
thunder "Free
Are you from Spanish rule."
Soon he'll land and "Old Glory's" stripes will
float o'er Cuban shore.
And its white stars shine more brightly than
they ever phone before.
And our noble bird of Freedom shriek aa the
scene it hovers o'er.
God bless the Yankee tar!
WflÃ NEWS BY WIRE.
The San Francisco Call has done this
community a valuable service since war
became certain with Spain by furnishing
news bulletins every day. Aside from
giving the news, the bulletins serve to
keep a whole lot of people busy watch
ing for the next ones.â Pomona Times.
Through the generosity and enterprise
of the San Francisco Call the people
throughout the country are supplied with
war bulletins free of cost. To fully real
ize the enormous cost of these bulletins,
It is only necessary to say that the ex
pense for the line from Reno to Alturas
alone amounts to floO per month. Nothing
which The Call could do would be so
highly appreciated by the people gene
rally as these gratuitous news bulletins,
and that paper is deserving the thanks
and gratitude of our people.â Alturas
Plain Dealer.
We must again refer to the war bulle
tins sent here with such rare manifesta
tions of enterprise by the San Francisco
Call. They have kept the city well in
formed as to the progress of affairs at the
front, and while one or two have turned
out to be unfounded, still this was not
the fault of the newspaper. It would
seem that in the mass of news from the
front an occasional unfounded report
must creep in. The Call must be given
credit for its enterprise, and we are free
to say that much of the war news now
engaging the attention of the American
people has come to us through its bulle
tins On some days the bulletins have
reached as high as fifty. The Call more
over is printing the best account of the
happenings at the front, as witness its
publication of the bombardment of Ma
tanzas ahead of the other San Francisco
morning papers. Its enterprise is greatly
appreciated by our people.â Anaheim

FACTS ABOUT PORTO RICO.
It may be that the heavy fighters of
Admiral Sampson's North Atlantic squad
ron are now plowing their way full
steamed to Porto Rico, about 1100 miles
from Key West, which they left Wednes
day morning. And, in that event. It
may be that, before the end of the week,
news will come of the fall of San Juan,
the capital of the island, and of the total
submission of Spain's easternmost pos
session In America.
Porto Rico is the fourth in size of the
Antilles. It lies southeast of Cuba and
is separated from the Island of San Do
mingo by a strait sixty-two miles wide.
The island forms an irregular parallelo
gram 108 miles long and about thlrty-
Beven miles wide, having an area of 3550
square miles.
From east to west it is traversed by a
range of hills. The highest district is in
the Sierra de Loguillo, near the south
east coast, where the peak of El Yunque
rises more than 3600 feet. The island Is
watered by about 1300 streams, of which
nearly flftv are considerable rivers. The
hills are pretty generally covered with
forests.
The island was declared a province of
Spain in 1870 and is divided into seven
departments or districts. The principal
cities are San Juan de Porto Rico, the
capital, with a population of about 24,
000; Ponce, the principal seaport town,
population 37.515: San German, popula
tion 31,000; Miiyaguez. population 12,000;
Arecivo, population 11,000, and Guayama,
population 5500. The seaports are: San
Juan, Ponce, Mayaguez, Naguabo, Faj
ardn, Aqutdilla and Viequez. The total
population of the island is about 830.000,
of which more than 300,000 are negroes,
only a few Asiatics being among the peo
ple. The majority of the inhabitants are
Roman Catholics, but other religions are
tolerated. The Gibaros, or small land
holders, and day laborers of the coun
try districts, are a curious old Spanish
stock, largely modified by Indian blood.
The harbor is one of the best In the
West Indies, having a comparatively
unobstructed entrance. Along the
wharves the water has a depth of 10 to
13 feet at low tide, and HVa to 14% feet at
high 'tide. Mayaguez, on the west coast,
is also situated several miles inland, and
is separated from its port by a river.
The island is governed by laws re
sembling those of the mother country.
It is under the command of a Governor
Captain General, appointed by tKe crown,
and assisted by a junta of military of
ficers. The Captain General is v.he Presi
dent of the Royal Audiencia or Assembly
of the island. There are the usual Pro
vincial Assembly, Court of Claims. In
tendency, one Chief Engineer of Public
Works, one Chief Engineer of Mines and
minor functionaries. The island elects
three Senators and fifteen Deputies to the
Spanish Cortes and twenty-seven Provin
cial Deputies.
The chief city of th<? Island, although
not the largest, Is San Juan, on the north
coast, with 25,000 inhabitants. It Is built
on an island connected with the main by
a bridge and causeway, and a magnificent
highway connects with the city of Ponce
on the southern coast. San Juan Is one
of the most co act of cities, built on a
peninsula term mted by a great fortress
and Inclosed within high walls. Kntrance
is only to be obtained through well-guard
ed gateways, from the lower batteries
and the mole, while sentinels stand vigi
lant on every parapet. It is only by
stealth that photographs can be taken or
these grim erray walls, the Spanish otn
cials seeming to think that they are as
effective for defense as in the days they
were first, built, two or three hundred
years ago.
The port, according to an American
who has recently left that place, is in a
fair condition of defense, and will be able
to hold its own for some time against our
fleet. The town was originally protected
by a wall of stone, which completely en
circled it. This has to some extent dis
appeared, but is still good on the side
next the sea. The wall is of stone, thirty
feet thick at the base and some twenty
at the top, and is about forty feet nign.
It is considered invulnerable except from
the heaviest guns. The Spaniards na\9
recently erected some fifteen or sixteen
ten-inch guns in modern batteries, ana
have also planted the harbor with mines
and torpedoes. Â . iV) .
The fleet could not conceal itself in the
harbor, however, for, although our ships
might not be able to reduce the batteries,
they could, nevertheless, sink the tor
pedo-boats lying at anchor at long range
San Juan is a sickly city in the summer
season, as it expects, and invariaoiy re
ceives, a visit from Yellow Jack, wno
takes his victims mainly from the un
acclimated classes. The houses of the
city, too, are crowded together after the
manner of those in the older PÂ°/ tlo , n Â°*
Havana, while the narrow and finny
streets are reeking reservoirs of corrup
tion and disease. Notwithstanding this,
however, there is a fine residential class
here composed of native and Spanisn
stock, and if the stranger brings good
letters of introduction he will be. 110 , 9 ?"'
ably received. That Is, according to
Spanish ideas of hospitality, which b> no
means approach the English standards,
and consist of an invitation to a care
(one Invitation), and, perhaps, as a great
favor, another to the cock pit.

All able-bodied men, who are anxious
to enlist can find the opportunity of do-
Ing so In the Fourteenth Infantry. One
battalion of this regiment is now en
camped at the Presidio under the com
mand of Major Robe. Lieutenant Hunt is
the recruiting officer of the regiment and
will furnish the necessary information to
all applicants. Major Robe said yester
day that he was anxious to recruit two
new companies immediately; â  and also to
fill up the skeleton companies as soon. as
possible. There is plenty of room for all
who want to enlist, provided, of course,
that they can pass the required physical
examination.' T,if>utenant Hunt can be
found at the headquarters of the Four
teenth's camp.
The Quartermaster's Department, under
the control of Lieutenant Neall, U. S. A.,
Is now In excellent working shape as far
as daily supplies for the men are con
cerned. .W hen Lieutenant Neall was
chosen acting chief quartermaster a
most wise appointment was made, for a
more able and efficient officer does not
bear arms in the United .States service
than he. The lieutenant is of the opinion
that all necessary ammunition for the
troops that are going to Manila will be
here In a few days. As fast as requisi

THE "HEAVIES"
NOW AT WORK.
They Have Taken Pos-
session of the Old
Woolen Mill.
The battalion of heavy artillery which
haa been quartered at the old First Reg
iment armory ever since the battery rolls
were opened there for volunteers, was
astir bright and early yesterday morn
| Ing, for the order had come to proceed to
I the new quarters at Fort Mason, where
i the battalion will remain until the Gov
ernment can equip it properly.
The men had nearly all been provided
with blankets, and these slung over the
i shoulder in military fashion, besides the
j few uniforms brought along with the
i men of the Sacramento cavalry troop
i when they took service as heavy artll
j tery, were the only claims to military dis
tinction which the battalion could boast.
It was 10 o'clock before the batteries
i were started, but the men soon dropped
I into step and marched steadily up Van
! Ness avenue, winning cheers ot encour
agement as they went along. They were
j all assigned to places in the Fontana
i warehouse before the call for dinner
I came, and before the afternoon had gone
\ the men had had their first drill and had
! all been "sized" by their battery cvbm
i manders, and the temporary non-commis
sioned officers had been chosen.
The building in which the troops are
quartered is the old woolen mill, which
â  lately has been used as a warehouse for
| Fontana, the commission merchant. It is
i large, clean, airy and well lighted, and
| there is am&le room for the 600 men who
make up the batteries. Three floors"
have been given over to the bat
teries, and the business of the
warehouse has all been confined to
the lower floor. On the second floor are
Captain Denis Geary and his battery, A;
also Captain John Cooke and Battery C.
On the third floor are Captain Theodore
Hay and Battery B, and Captain Henry
Steere and Battery D. On the fourth
floor are the cooking outfits and the mess
tables. The adjutant. Captain John Kos
ter, has a room by the entrance, and just
across the hall is a room for Major Rice,
commander of the battalion.
The men are still being fed by a caterer,
but it is expected that as soon as the or
ganization gets into shape the caterer will
be let go and battery cooks will be de
tailed from the ranks and the men will
have a taste of field cooking.
The quarters have been given over to
the battalion rent free, and in addition
Mr. Fontana has notified Major Rice that
he can have any loose wood lying around
for cooking and camp fire purposes, and

that San Francisco's mechanics contri

GERMANS IN LINE.
San Francisco Schuetzen
Verein Rifles to Offer
Their Services.
The San Francisco Schuetzen Verein
will hold an important meeting at Califor
| nia Hall, 620 Bush street, on Friday even-
I ing next. This organization has 175 uni
i formed men, armed with the best and
i latest improved rifles. It is the sense of
i the body, it is said, that they offer them
i selves to the Governor for active service
as a home guard. The question is to be
decided by a resolution, which" is expected
to pass at this meeting. This is the oldest
Germanmilitary organization on the coast.
When Lincoln was assassinated the mem
bers took up their arms and went on duty
in the streets of this city to assist in pre
serving order and preventing bloodshed.
When it was decided that no foreign flags
should be carried in procession, by order
of the Governor, the San Francisco
I vereins dropped their beloved German
' flag for the stars and stripes, and a Cali-
I fornia flag, to which their allegiance was
i pledged. Hence they claim to be as loyal
i to Uncle Siim as any troops in America.
As the organization is composed of men
whose heads are crowned with locks of
I gray, they would not be accepted as vol
| unteers in the regular service. Realizing
' this, they hope to take the place of the
younger men who have enlisted under the
1 call for troops from this State. Though
â¢â  old in years, they still feel able to defend
i the homes of those brave men who have
departed for more active fields.
The company Is composed of some of the
wealthiest and most influential Germans
: in the city, and they are all dead shots.
' Their captain is John F. Bolts, who has
i been elected to the position for the
; eleventh time. He is heart and soul in
i the movement.

tween the hours of 1:30 and 4:30 to the

Fourteen United States Infantry en
camped on the reservation. There will be

of the Loyal Legion conduct the function,
using the Presidio Club rooms through the
courtesy of the officers of the garrison,
as it would be inconvenient for those to
whom the reception is tendered to come
to the Occidental Hntel.
Captain F. de L. Carrington, mustering

In the tug-of-war contest the married

by Harry Roessler, owing to the tine
work of Louis Berger, who managed to
slip some sinewy single men into the mar
ried men's team, on the theory that mar
ried men are "no good."
In the target-shooting, Al Lehrke won
the Philo Jacoby gold medal with a score
of 66; J. Elliott won the special prize in

OFFICIAL and private messages
received in this city yesterday
clearly indicate that the Govern

Francisco to the Philippine Islands. Tel-
egrams announce that volunteer troops
from Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and
Kansas, as well as volunteers from
Washington, Idaho, Montana, Oregon,

dered to this city. Space will be found
on the Presidio reservation for the en

Dispatches received at army headquar
ters in the Phelan building yesterday did
not state when General Merriam would
be in San Francisco. It is thought the
general wants to make sure that all the
details for the organization and muster
ing in of the Washington and Oregon vol
unteers will be settled before he leaves
Vancouver to establish permanent head
quarters here. He has detailed two mem
bers of his staffâ Lieutenant W. S. Graves
and Lieutenant J. B. Bennettâ to assist in
mustering in the volunteers from the two
States mentioned.
The following telegram was received at
army headquarters yesterday:
WASHINGTON, D. C. May 11. IS9S.
Major J. B. Wltcher, Paymaster, U. S. A.,
San Francisco: You are hereby relieved from
duty at San Francisco by the Secretary of
War, who directs as necessary for public serv
ice that you proceed to Portland, Or., and re
port by letter to the commanding officer of
the department of the Columbia for duty as
chief paymaster of that department. By com
mand of MAJOH-GENKRAX. MIL.ES.
SCHWAN, Assistant Adjutant-General.
The recruiting station of the Thir<*
United States Artillery on the fourth floor
of the Phelan building is one of the busi
est places in San Francisco. The recruit
ing officer, Lieutenant Delamere Skerrett,
U. S. A., had 100 applicants in line yester
day. Two hundred men have been en
rolled, and the army surgeons have all
they can do to keep up with the recruit
ing officer. The Third Artillery is an ex
cellent regiment, commanded by officers
of superior intelligence. The grade of the
service is high, and when the war is over
the men who are now enlisting may be
mustered out if they desire to leave the
army. To bring the regiment up to the
war standard of 203 men to each battery,
places can be found for 800 recruits.
Lieutenant Boyd of the Fourth United
States Cavalry is doing a fine business in
the recruiting line at his station on the
Presidio. Forty recruits were assigned to
various regiments yesterday by Colonel
Morris, commanding the post.
Captain Long, acting chief quartermas
ter of the department, is actively engaged
in procuring ships to transport troops and
supplies to Manila. The steamships Ohio
and Connemaugh, belonging to the Inter
national Steamship Company of Philadel
phia, were secured yesterday. The Ohio
has cargo space for 2300 tons, and can
carry 1000 troops. The Connemaugh is a
freighter, with a capacity of 2000 tons.
The work of preparation for the expedi
tion is so far advanced that all the food
supplies have been purchased and ware
housed. Nothing remains to be done in
this line beyond storing the supplies on
the steamships which may be engaged to
carry the goods to Manila. The Australia
went on the dry dock yesterday noon.
According to a private telegram re
ceived at the Presidio yesterday by Colo
nel A. J. Coffee, the First Battalion of
Oregon Volunteers left Portland last
evening for this city. Colonel Summers,
commanding the Oregon regiment of vol
unteers, announced that eight companies
would leave for this city next Sunday
evening.
EDISON COMPANY BLAMED.
Vote of Censure by a Coroner's Jury
for Leaving a Two Thousand
Volt Wire Uninsulated.
The Edison Electric Light Company
was blamed by a Coroner's Jury yester
day for the. death of Charles Froid, a
lineman employed by the Sunset Tele
phone Company. Froid was making some
repairs to a telephone line on April 22
when the line broke and fell across a wire
Of the Edison company. The latter wire,
; ccording to the testimony of the wit
nesses, was charged with an alternating
current of 2000 volts. Froid received the
full force of the current and died in the
ambulance on the way to the City Receiv
ing Hospital.
Fellow-workmen of the deceased testi
fied that the Edison wire was not Insulat
ed. Ths jury returned a verdict, in which
the following occurred: "That had said
wire been properly covered death might
have been avoided."

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal

temperature. The word 'â¢high" means high
barometric pressure and 13 usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 11.â The active demand
for stocks and bonds was renewed with great
vigor and confidence to-day. An pri"rr>cuÃ
volume of business was done on the Stock Ex
change and prices are, subscautially . higher
an arour.O A large number of the lead'u*
stocks show net gains excelling iwo poii.ts,
and a great many more have risen one point
or over In the price as a result of tin day's
trading. The upward movement was not re
sumed until a period of hesitation and in-"
certainty at the opening, during whl:h ppri es
In nearly all cases declined. This heaviness
was due to the sharp declines established In
London for American quotations before the
opening here and to the placing of selling or
ders for London account at the opening. There
â was also a well-organized raid against a num
ber of . leading Industrial stocks. Sugar and
Tobacco were conspicuously singled out for
this attack, but the I bears were in haste to
cover their short contracts even at the small
decline achieved. Evidently many of the large
bull operators who. had taken the profits yes
terday were also anxious to get back and saw
an Inviting opportunity at the lower ! level of
prices resulting from yesterday's declines. The
demand for stocks in the first hour was urgent
and many blocks of 1000 shares were eagerly
bought. By the time the news of the Wall
street attitude , had reached London that mar
ket faced about and sent orders to 7 New York
to buy.'' Although there was realizing :on a
large scale at different times during the day,
the recessions in prices were insignificant. The
day closed â  with a renewed burst of activity
and. prices at about the top level. The belief
that the termination of the war is near at
hand was the impelling motive for the strength
of the market. -
A small engagement of gold- for export dem
onstrates that exchange. Is still at the " gold
point. â â¢; - . -'

CHICAGK) GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May 11.â The provision market
to-day shook off the lethargy under which It
has been laboring while foreign markets were
on a rampage. It was a bull market from start
to finish and led all others In point of specu
lative interest. No new feature of the phases
of the business that are open to public In
spection could be discerned to account for tho
great strength developed, and it must therefore
be supposed that something In the internal
working of the packing business had not until
to-day been quite ready for the move that liae
its expression In the provision pit. All the
large packers took a hand in the buying. Ar
mour, Swift and the Cudahys were said to be
the heaviest purchasers. The best bualpew of
the session was in lard. As this commodity
is traded in by the hundredweight its advance
of 6ic is equivalent to $2 15 per tierce. To
ward the middle of the session moderate realiz
ing sales caused temporary reactions, but the
highest rates of the day were prevailing at
the rlose. July pork closed at $11 87%, an ad
vance of 80c, lard at $6 55, or 65c up, and ribs
for July at $6 05, a net gain of 45c.
A steady opening In the Liverpool wheat mar
ket imparted a better tone here at the *tart.
Trade was light. July began at $1 12%Â»8>1 14%,
%c higher to l%c lower than yesterday, and
held steady around $1 16 for a time, with little
for sale below $1 14. The greater part of the
I short Interest in July had presumably bm a
forced to cover and traders were generaiiy dis
inclined to enter Into fresh trades. Extreme
nervousness st 11 1 characterized the business
and fluctuations during the greater part of the
forenoon were In straight %c Jumps and
! tumbles. Liquidation set in shortly alter the
i opening and from $1 15 July tumbled to $1 ]0,
. rallying rapidly to $1 13. Realizing was at
tempted on every recovery, and resulted in the
i market gradually quieting down around SI 13.
| Closing Liverpool cables quoting declines of
! %d for May, Vid for July and 2>*d for Septem
1 ber caused a fresh decline here. July touched
$1 09i* an( i rallied feebly, closing at $1 10%, a
net loss of 3%c. May. which opened 10c lower
at tl 76, recovered to $1 80, closing 6c net lower
at $1 79.
Trading in corn was brisk, owing to tho mi
gration of scalpers from the wheat pit. The
provision boom helped prices. July closed with
a gain of lc for the day.
Oats ruled firm, with corn within a narrow
range. July closed Vie higher.

TO CULTIVATE A PRETTY INSTEP.
The evilly disposed person who Invented
spring-heel shoes has thousands of ugly
flat feet for which to render amount.
The nervous strain on the body, caused
by the pounding of the heelless shoes on
the hard ground, is very considerable.
And more than that. It is almost Impossi
ble to carry the weight on the balls of the
feet under such circumstances. Of course
high heels are equally injurious, but a
heel of medium height with good width
will allow the Instep to develop as it
should.
To cultivate the instep to Its proper
arch no exercise is bo effective as this-
Stretch the foot downward, the toe al
ways endeavoring to reach a point just
beyond itself.â Kathertne E. Junkermann

ESTATE WORLD
The Market Is Gradually
Changing for the
Better.
A. M. Speck Makes the Larg
est Sale in Many
\ Months.
A Glances at the Records, Sales And
General Notes of Realty
Interest.
The record in real estate sales for the
past six months was broken by the firm
of A. M. Speck & Co., who disposed of the
property situated at 1130 and 1132 Market
and 25 Turk street by private sale yester
day afternoon for $150,000. The property
consists of a four-story brick building ex
tending twenty-live feet on Market street
and thirty-one on Turk. It was formerly
owned by ox-t.cnator Jeremiah Lynch,
and was bought in by i . F. Nolan. The
money paid for the building was Invested
In bonds, but the buyer withdrew it to in
vest in real estate. Mr. Nolan has not
yet determined what disposition to make
of the premises, but he thinks he has a
lessee who will take the entire lower
floor. â  .
A slight improvement marked the gen
eral progress in the realty world during the
past week, and present indications point
favorably toward better times for the
future.
: The theory advanced for the stagnant
condition of the market for April was
that as long as war lasted and the coun
try was threatened with its attendant
dangers real estate must of necessity be
at a low ebb. Since open hostilities have
broken out, however, the opinion has
changed among the city brokers and
agents who are generally considered an
authority on all matters appertaining to
real estate and the solution of difficulties
that might agitate the market, either for
good or bad. They claim mat property
in this city and the interior will : not
decrease, and point to the slow but per
ceptible advance of the real estate cur
rent as proof or il.s assertion.
Building took a Might change for the
better and many contracts of consider
able size and importance were awarded
within tho past five or six days. i
in the interior the war scare Is gradu- ;
ally subsiding, and both building and In

WRITTEN BEFORE
DEWEY'S VICTORY
Letter^ From One of the Boys
On the U. S. Flagship
Olympia.
Eager to Meet the Spanish and Pre
dicting That Which Has
Since Happened.
Since the wonderful battle in Manila
Bay has been fought everything pertain
ing to it has a peculiar interest. The men,
who caught the spirit of the intrepid
Dewey, and aided him in securing one
of the greatest victories ever achieved,
assume a new importance. They were
part of the force upholding the honor of
the American flag.
A recent letter from one of the crew of
the Olympia, received in this cfty, reads,
in the light of events, much like a proph
ecy fulfilled. And for all the letter treats
of the serious business of war, it shows
throughout a spirit of absolute unconcern.
There" is not the slightest fear but that
war will bring honor. The writer refers
blithely to good time* had in San Fran
cisco, and the hope of good times to come.
The assurance he had of being able to
beat the Spanish, the desire for an op
portunity were characteristic of all the
men under Dewey. The letter was writ
ten under date of April 9. After allud
ing to old San Francisco days, the writer
Bays:
I expected to be back there by this time, but
the trouble with the Spanish has kept us here,
an'l we are expected to go Into battle at a
I moment's notice. If we do you will hear a
good account of us, as the boys are all eager
to avenge ths deaths of our shipmates of the
â  Maine. There Will not be anything but Span-
I iÂ«h spoken in hell for ten years if we get at
j them.
If we do have war I want you to pay strict
| attention to the cablegrams and you will hear
of one of the greatest battles of modern war
: fare, as our fleet and that of the Spanish out
'â  here are evenly matched. But I do not think
I it will last long, as all of cur boys are good
i thnts and are ptandtng by ready for the word
\ which will commit the Spanish to their doom
forever. If it is settled end peace restored
! we will spend the glorious Fourth of July in
i San Francicco.
Here the writer began to plan the good
limes that were sure to come then. He
dismissed the thought of war; a devil
may-care lad ready for a fight or frolic;
the material which makes the personnel
of the navy as much a part of its strength
as the plate which fortifies its battleships.
Now that the battle has been fought,
and the boys on the Olympia did more
than could possibly have been expected
of them, another letter from the same
writrr would be read with zest renewed
Probably he would remark that the Span
ish had been licked, and then go on lay
ing plans to paint the town a modest hue
of red; for of such is the navy of Uncle
Sam.
Feared Huntingdon Might Leave.
A meeting of the Rnilroad Commis
sioners was held in their rooms yesterday
afternoon with President La Rue in the !
chair and all three members present. The
president and secretary of the Southern '
Pacific Company and those of the leased
lines of the c ->oration had been sub- j
penaed to appear before the commission,
but on account of the Investigation of
grain rates in the United States Circuit
Court the matter was put over till Mon
day, the lfith inst., at 1 o'clock, and on
that day Huntington will again be placed
on the rack if he has not left the city
before that time.
The only other matter that came up
was the filing of an amended complaint
by George W. Mor.teith in thÂ« name of
John R. Robinson against the Southern
Pacific Company and others. The com
plaint does not differ materially from the
old one except that another corporation
or two has been added to the defendants.
An affidavit was also filed by Robinson,
stating that it was his. belief that Collis, I
who hau been subpenaed in the Robinson
case would leave the city before the time
limit of fifteen days allowed him to an
swer the subpena, and application was
made to have the limit reduced. It was
accordingly* ordered that the railroad j
magnate answer to this summons at the :
same time as the one of the commission, !
wmch will accordingly be on Monday at 1 j
o'clock.
Banqueted at Woodland.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 12, 1898.
DREAMS OF GOLD
MILES OF GOLD
A Californian's Hopeful
Clutch at a Klondike
Bonanza.
Robert Anderson Expects to
Make $16,000,000 by Hy
draulic Mining.
Secures a Twenty- Year Government
Lease of Part of Hunker
Creek.
"Rich beyond the dreams of avarice."
Such is the expectation of Robert Ander
son, a well-known California mining man
; of wide and varied experience, who claims
1 to have secured a bonanza in the Klon
dike gold fields.
Mr. Anderson came directly to San
I Francisco in 1Â»74, and has ever since Ween
I engaged in mining in California and else
; where. In June last Mr. Anderson went !
'to the Klondike, and found that the :
' lower five miles of Hunker Creek had not i
: been taken up by the miners, on account
i of the stream being so wide arul "Hat." j
I He immediately made a proposition to j
Gold Commissioner Fawsett that if he
could obtain a twenty-yoar lease of
three miles of the vacant creek he would,
i through his connections in London, put
'â  up $250,000 and demonstrate thut hydraulic
I mining is practicable in the Yukon coun
try. As the ground was bringing the Gov- j
ernment nothing, the Commissioner rf <â¢(<:Â«- ;
| mended the granting of the lease. Hur
rledly going to Ottawa, Mr. AnderÂ»on i
; had but little difficulty in obtaining the
desired lease from the Government, it
being granted by order of the Council.
Crossing over to London, he formed a I
large company, under the name of the I
I Klondike Government Concession, Limited. â ,
!of Hunker Creek, and easily induced
i several wealthy noblemen and prominent
capitalists to invest in the efiterpfiiie.
i The company was capitalized at $2,500,000. j
I and the stock was ail taken. The sum of ,
! $250.0*10. was at once put up as working ;
1 capital. Mr. Anderson came to San Fran
dti i a f'-w lUiys ago to engage an ex
| perienced mining engineer and to make
: preliminary Â«rranÂ«wnents for the con
i struction of machinery, which will be
; shipped to Dawson Rt the opening of
nnvlgation on the Yukon next year, 'mis
sslon. by the way. is the first and
only one of tlk kind that has been grant
i cd. The Government, of course, will re
oeive the usual royalty.
Hunker Creek, where it is covered by
j this concession, is about 2i\X) feet wide. and
I it is estimated that it will pay not less
than $1000 per running foot, making a total
|of nearly $16,000,000. The property haa i
i been favorably reported on by three cx
i perts. after a careful Investigation. It
I extends from Last Chance Creek to
' the junction of the Hunker and the Klon
j dike, and is about thirteen mile 3 from
i Dawson.
"There is no reason why hydraulic min
ing should not prove a success in the
' Yukon country, said Mr. Anderson.
"Thore has been successful hydraulic
mining in Siberia for years. The condi
tions in the Klondike region are the same.
The ground has been frozen for apes. The
only trouble is clearing off the moss. The |
I introduction of hydraulic mining will
Work a revolution in the methods now
employed, and will produce wonderful and j
quick results. There is no place in the |
world whore there is as good a show to j
make money witfc capital as In the Klon- I
dike gold fields. The jrold that I saw there j
exceeded my wildest dreams. I don't earo
to tell what my expectations are, as peo- f
pie might not believe me. However, I I
am free to say that that chance trip to |
Dawson has made me a millionaire â how
i many times a millionaire I don't know
yet.
"For a practical miner there is no better
place than the Klondike. I have been in j
far morr> inhospitable countries in my i
time. The region Is healthy. All the !
country needs is transportation facilities. !
and thot It is bound to have at no dtetant i
day. Many people go to th* Klondike who '
I have no business to pro there, and meet j
! with failure and death."
Mr. Anderson, who has been staying at
i the Palace Hotel, left last evening for
Pawsnn via Seattle, accompanied by his
engineer. They will spend the summer in
i planning the work that is to be done next
year.

GUSTAV WALTER
LAID TO REST
Friends Look Upon the Face
of the Dead as It Lay
in State.
TherÂ« May Be a Contest Over the
Valuable Estate of tho
Deceased.
The body of the late Gustav "Walter,
founder of the Orpheum, who was known
in the histrionic world from here to the
Antipodes, was yesterday laid in the
tomb. At 11 a. m. the remains were re
moved from the undertaking parlors on
Washington street to B'nal B'rith Hall
and there they lay in state until 1 o'clock
in the afternoon. The funeral cortege
was then formed and wended itÃ way to
Odd Fellows' Cemetery, where the body
was placed in a receiving vault. It will
remain there until a family vault has
been constructed.
The funeral was simple and unostenta
tious. There was no sneaking, no frieriu
told the story of the dead man's life and
its accompanying usefulness, but it mat
tered not to the host ut friends who
mourned his loss. Hundreds of peop:e
looked upon the face of the dead
while it lay in state and many followed
the body to its resting place. A band,
playing the solemn dead march, lea the
cortege to the cemetery. There, as at
the hall, Rev. Dr. Wilson recited a prayer
and the body was closed in the tomb.
It is estimated that the estate left by
the deceased is worth in the neighborhood
of $500 000. and there promises to be a
contest over its disposition. For sixteen
years prior to his death Mr. Walter did
hot live with his wife, and for several
years past the deceased was Intimately
associated with a Mrs. Sterritt. which
facts may bring about litigation. Mrs.
Sterritt may file a claim against the
estate, but the widow will vigorously con
test any unreasonable claim on her part.
If no will is found Mrs. Walter will claim
one-half of the estate, and the remainder
will be divided among the collateral
heirs.
BATE WAX PROSPECT.
Figures May be Cve â A New Road in
Tuolumne.
Affairs were never as quiet In railroad
circles as at the present time, and it
Mould appear that the vtort* of Collis P.
i Huntington has had a soothing- effect, and
tbat after he leaves h^ro, should he sur
! vlve the wordy onslaughts of the Rail
| road Commission, things will become
! lively again. Thore is one thing that
might have a tendency to liven up mat
ters and that is the prospnet of a rate
: war between the Canadian Pacific and the
j Southern Pacific. This might be preci
pitated by the action of the Freight Traffic
I Bureau meeting in Milwaukee, although
i the question will not be handled by that
body in executive session, as it is entirely
out of .their province, they being con
cerned With freight rates only. However,
there will be a number or officers of the
transcontinental lines present at that
meeting, and no dcubt they will take up
the matt<r at a private session, and the
! cut in passenger rates mnd.-- l.v the
Canadian will be met in some way by
' the S P. Company. Nothing ts yet deu
nitely known except that such a course
is intended.
A new railroad is in course of construc
tion in this State to be known as the
Stockton and Tuolumne County Railroad.
â  It will be sixty miles long and run from
Stockton through <-onperopolis, Angers
Camp and Sonora, the terminal point be
ing at Summerville. It will tap a large
i and prosperous grain growinsr section and
I the leading mines of the mother lode in
'â¢ Tuolumno County. There are vast amounts
j of rebellious ores in that section that can
1 not be profitably worked there, and it
I costs too much to bring them to this city.
' The company intend preoting two smelt-
I erÃ at Stockton, so that the importance of
' the venture may be appreciated. Surveys
have, reached Copperopolis. and as there
are rails and ties for twelve miles of
track on the ground, the road will be
pushed to a rapid completion.
The entire system of the San Fran
cisco nnd San .Toa'iuin Valley Railroad
between P.akersfleld and Stockton Is ex
pected to be in active operation by June 1.

Beet Pulp for Cattle.
There was an interesting session of the

discussed was the beet sugar industry-
Pro feseor Hilgard was ill, but Professors
Loughridge and Jaffa discussed the sub
ject. They showed that the pulp of the
sugar beet is very valuable for food for
cattle, as it contains a large proportion
of fat producing substance. It is best to
mix it with alfalfa. These addresses were

FOR EXTORTING
NEVILLS` COIN
The Fresno Scandal Will Have
an Airing in the Police
Court This Morning.
Myron H. Azhdaerlsn, Mrs. Eisie Wil
liams and Her Sister Locked Up
in thÂ« City Prison.
The NevillÃ-Williams-Azhdaerian lm
brogolio has been temporarily transferred
from Fresno to this city, and this morn
ing in Judge Joachimsen's court both
sides will have an opportunity of telling
their stories to the world.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Elsie Williams,
Mrs. GraÂ«'e Loose, her sister, and Myron
H. Azhdaerian were brought from Fresno
to the City Prison by Deputy Sheriff Tim
mins and booked on charges of felony
extortion. The complaining witness is
Captain W. A. Nevills, the mining mil
lionaire of Jamestown, Tuolumne County.
The specific charge on which the de
fendants were arrested Is for extorting
$2000 from the complaining witness on
February 25 last while he was sick with
grip at the Palace Hotel by threatening
to deliver to Nevills' wife certain letters
which he had written to Mrs. Williams,
showing that illicit relations had existed
between them.
The defendants were arraigned In Judge
Joachimsen's court yesterday morning.
They were represented by ex-Judge Fer
ral and Attorney W. H. Payson. Ferral
said that he was ready to proceed, but
after consultation with Private Detective
Curtin, Prosecuting Attorney Graham
asked for a continuance till this morning
at 11 o'clock, which was granted.
Ferral then asked that the defendants
be released on bonds accepted by the Su
perior Judge at Fresno, but the Judge
declined to accept them, as he did not
know the sureties. Ferral thereupon
urged that the bonds of $5000 should be
reduced, as the amount was excessive,
but no action was taken, and the defen
dants were sent back to prison.
Arhdaerian constituted himself the
spokesman for the trio. He said that
Neville had been "stringing on" Mrs. Wil
liams with the objert of getting a divorce
from his wife and marrying her. With re
gard to the charge Azhdaerian said that
it was untrue. Nevills had sent Mrs.
Newcomb, a friend, to Fresno, to bring
Mrs Williams to the Palace Hotel to see
him They came to the city, and he ac
companied them, as Novllls wanted to see
him about a house he was building for
him Mrs. Williams got the check from
Nevills and cashed it at the Wells-Fargo
Bank The money was paid to Mrs. Wil
liams in accordance with a promise by
Nevills that he would pay her debts and
make her comfortable. On the same
promise he gave her later an order for
some securities In FreÃno.
In the afternoon Mrs. Williams was
taken to the District Attorney's office,
where Captain Nevills and his wife were
waiting for her. She was kept there for
about half an hour, and when she came
out to go back to the prison she was in
tears and became hysterical in her cell in
the prison. _
There are now four times as many wire
nails made as cut nails.

FAVORITES
WERE RAPPING
First and Second Choices
Won All the Races
at Oakland.
Fonsovannah Enjoyed a Cake
Walk, Starting at Short
Odds.
Gold Fin â  Disappointmentâ Shasta
Water In No Form- ClÂ«wson
Piloted Threu Winner*.
The outsiders agaia kept in the back
jrround at Oakland yesterday, the ma
jority of winners all being held at short
prices in the ring. Of the favorites,
Midas, Fonsovannah and Miss Rowena
all won in handy fashion, while the
other three events went to Owyhee, La
Goleta and Bernardillo, well backed sec
ond choices.
The weather was perfect for racing
purposes, and the track in splendid
condition. Clawson carried off the rid
ing honors by landing three of his
mounts past the wire first, with Pig&ott
at his heels with two firsts.
Midas was strongly touted to win
the opening six furlong sprint, and
backed down to 6 to 5 favoritism, led
the outsider, Rapido, out in a head fin
ish. Nervoso was a close third. Those
behind them were a bad lot.
A cluster of very ordinary two-year
olds next lined up in a five furlong
scramble, with Gold Fin ruling a 4 to o
favorite. The Goldfinch youngster got
away well, led into the stretch, and
then died away to nothing. Pi^ ott
won easily with Owyhee, the Montana
colt The "Fretter finishing a good sec
ond' Also Ran, a 40 to 1 chance, was
landed in the show by McDonald.
For the seven furlong selling affair
the books chalked up 3 to 2 against
Shasta Water, but the Burns & Water
house entry did not seem to be in great
demand, for she receded to 2 to 1. La
Goleta also went back in the betting,
but turned up an easy winner. Taking
the lead from Zamar in the stretch,
she led Honig's sprinter out in a can
ter. In a drive Watomba beat the first
choice a head for the show.
Sam Hildreth's consistent performer
Fonsovannah was looked upon as the
goods for the mile and a sixteenth run,
and experienced no difficulty in win
ning hands down from Odds On, which
made all the running.
The mile selling run was very nearly
captured by a rank outsiderâ Ellsr.iore.
With Miller in the saddle the books
laid 40 to 1 against Dan Honig's Mor
el !o horse, and he led the field to the
paddock. Here, through hard urging,
Piggntt got up with the second choice.
Bernardillo, and, hard ridden, downed
the lons shot less than a length in the
fsst time of l:40U. Recreation, the post
favorite, away from the post poorly,
finished a distant third.
The speedy Miss Rowena took anoth
er five furlong spin off the reel. In the
betting she was a slight favorite over
Hitdreth's filly Hurly Burly and won
all the way. Saticoy, an outsider, took
show honors.
TRACK NOTES

reinstated, will be a start' r in the mile and

prising Rubicon, Roadwarmer. Midas and
others.
According to report the fast filly Valendenne
cams out of her last race, when beaten some
days ago by St. Calatlne, in very bad shape.
She received a kick that will probably keep
her on the shelf for some time to come.
It seems as though there were times whÂ«n
Mr. Ferguson forgets for the time being that
a big red recall flag reposes peacefully in his
good left hand.* He also, no doubt, overlooks
the fact that horses other than the Burns &
Waterhouse entries are expected to get fair
treatment at the post. When Lady Ashley waa
left at the poet in the last event the ring la'a
but 6 to 5 against her finishing third, and a
wad of coin was bet on the mare. Just swish
it once in a while. Mr. Ferguson, In the last
event, even If the peals of the dinner bell can
be heard over the waters.
A match race was decided at the Oakland
track yesterday mornlnp for a princely wager.
Dan Honig bet W. L. Stanfleld $2 that Judge
Napton could beat Mike Rice at five furlongs.
The money was covered by the tall Texan and
the horses were sent over to the post. Mike
won smiling after being outfooted the first few
yards, and Dan is now looking for a new man
in the bUÃiness In quest of horses.
J. McSweeny. the one time owner of St. Cala
tlne. accompanied by a deputy sheriff or two
and a member of the legal fraternity, visited
the track yesterday and spent some time in a
fruitless search for the muchly-wanted filly.
She is now supposedly owned by Sam Hildreth

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 12, 1893.
NEWS OF
THE DIAMOND
BY JOE CORBETT.
"Ham" Iberg has finally affixed his sig
nature to a San Jose contract- Good boy,
Omelet. As a financier, you even out
class "Truck" Egan.
The line up of the Frisco team, as It is
at present, will make things pretty warm.
They must, however, secure another grood
pitcher. i^ti
"Big Bill" Lang is playing great ban
for Chicago. It looks as if he would lead
the league in base-running this year.
Billy Nash has finally signed with Phila
delphia. The management endeavored to
cut his salary, but Bill could not see it
that way.
Pitcher Wheeler, the "soldier boy, has
not been signed by Fresno. It is said
that McGucken has Wheeler, or rather,
has a claim on him.
Pitcher Mosklman wants to go to Man
ila. The young man is very patriotic, and
says if they will take him he will enlist.
Pitchers arÂ© mighty scarce, and In view of
that fact, some of the managers should
enlist.
Henry Krug is about the best all
around player in the league. His pitching
last Sunday places h'm among the best.
The only way to remain a good pitcher
is by unremitting practice. Henry lacks
control, and should, therefore, practiceup.
Manager McGucken was greatly put out
over his defeat last Sunday. He says
when the San Franciscos come to San
Jose there will be a very different story
to tell.
Karl Krug should make a good short
stop. His debut in that position last Sun
day, while not a howling success, was
good enough for the first time. Don't^run
in on hard hit grounders too fast, Karl,
they are, at times, very hard to judge on
the run.
The managers of the Pacific Coast
League seem to be in a quandry regard
ing the securing of pitchers suitable to
hold their own with the faster organiza
tions. If some of the managers who are
in need of men for this position would en
deavor to secure either Rackenfield,
Overmeyer or Pitt they would, no doubt,
nnd their troubles at an end.- Either of
the three is capable of holding his own
against any team in the league to-day.
The action of President Bert in insist
ing upon players appearing upon the
ball field In their full and complete uni
form is one of the wisest moves that has
been brought to the attention of the man
agers of the league this season. Here
after any club that presents a player In a
uniform or part of a uniform other than
his regular club costume will subject the
management of such club to a fine of not
iess than $5.
Subscriber: Tim Donahue, now catch
ing for the Chicagos, caught me when I
pitched against the All-Americas at Rec
reation Park.
Great, indeed, is Jimmy Hughes! Just
think of it! Mighty Boston, the winners
of the pennant last year, were again
shut out by this baseball wonder. Three
measly little hits were all those great
hitters could get off his delivery. Why,
say, "Susie," the "Great," is not to be
compared with this young native son.
Never in the history of the National
League did a young pitcher ever do such
phenomenal work. When Brooklyn beat
him about a we-ek and a half ago the
Boston critics came out in big headlines,
"Hughes, the <"alifornia Wonder, Has
Explod.-il." What a bitter pill it must
have been to these gentlemen when
Hughes on Monday last went right into
their city and for the second time this
season shut out those champions:
Pitching in Haiti more and pitching In
Boston are entirely two different propo
sitions. In naltimore you are playing be
fore your own people. Thoy cheer and
encourage you from the beginning to the
end of a game. In Boston what, a change.
From the moment you enter the box 15.000
to 20,000 howling fanatics rise up in one
body and hurl defiance at you until the
last man is out. A pitcher to win there
must possess an abundance of "nerve" as
well as skill. "Our Jimmie" has demon
strated beyond all doubt that he has nerve
â that howling thousands do not bother
him. as they do many an old, seasoned
pitcher â that he can pitch as well away
from Baltimore as he can when there.
Just to give an illustration of what a
Boston crowd can do to a pitcher if he
lacks nerve was never better demonstrat
ed than in the case of Mr. Hoffer of the
Baltimore team. He was pitching against
Bostons last summer, and had his game
won up to the last inning, tfie s<-ore
standing 9 to 6 in his favor. Two men
were out In the last half of the ninth,
when that crowd opened up. Such a noise
I never heard in my life. Yet those fans
knew what they were doing. Mr. Hoffer
went in the air. He could not stand the
racket. Before he came down six bases
on balls, a base hit, and the game was
lost. Having played in Boston, and
knowing what a pitcher must pass
through to win his game, I do not hesi
tate in declaring this latest victory of
Hughes the greatest of them all. "Can
he keep up the pace?" Is the question
asked everywhere. Time alone will tell.
At the present writing he is the greatest
twirler of the age. T'ntil he falls, which
I believe will never happen, lovers of the
frame, as well as those who play it, must
tip their hats to "Jimmie" Hughes, "the
California Marvel."
The action of President Bert regarding
the single umpire system will, no doubt,
meet with the approval of every baseball
lover in the State of California. There is
no doubt that one good umpire who is
active and alert during the game will
give much more satisfaction than the
double umpire system. In case, there is
one umpire it is necessary for him to ex
ert himself and be at the different poir^S
of the diamond where nc-cesary to give
his decision. In so doing be inspires the
players to work hard, and in consequence
there will be less wrangling, more base
ball, and the games will be played In one
hour and thirty minutes, except upon
extraordinary occasions.
They Were Not Prejudiced.
The members of the present Grand Jury
were examined before Judge Cook yester
day concerning: their alleged prejudice
when voting to indict A. C. Widber, the
defaulting City Treasurer. They all de
nied having: been influenced In any way
by the newspaper reports of his shortage
and testified that the indictment was
found on the evidence given before them.
Judge Cook took the matter under ad
visement until next Saturday, when he
will also render a decision on the de
murrer interposed by Widber's attorney
to the indictment.
Swedish Society's Picnic.
An event which, from the preparations
already made, promises much In the way
of pure, wholesome fun is the picnic of
the Swedish Society, which is billed for
Shell Mound Park next Sunday. There
will be races of all kinds for gentlemen
ladies and children, and a splendid list
of prizes has been prepared. The Swedish
Society's Glee <"lul> will ;ilso be present
to lighten the hours with music.

ROBBED BY
TWO CLEVER
BUNKO MEN
Charles Becker Was
an Easy Victim of
Sharpers.
Claimed That They Were
Well-Known Lumber
Merchants.
Had Him Draw Five Hundred
Dollars Out of the
Bank.
THE POLICE NOTIFIED.
Ona of thÂ« Robbers Is Said to Be
"Scarped Face" Rounds, a No
torious Thief.
Chief Lees and his detectives are
searching for two bunko men who clev
erly robbed Charles Becker, a young
man, of his savings, amounting to $500.
Last Sunday the men inserted an ad-
vertisement in a morning- paper, stat
ing that they were anxious to hire a
young man as clerk, and that it would
be necessary for him to furnish $500
as a guarantee that he would be faith
ful to his employers. The advertise
ment purported to have been inserted
by Jackman & Matson, wholesale lum
ber dealers. After reading the adver
tisement Baker, anxious to secure
work, went to the place designated by
the men, and was met by an old man
who represented that he was one of
the members of the lumber company.
He told the unsophisticated youth that
he was anxious to employ a clerk, but
stipulated that it would be necessary
for him to put up $500 as a guarantee
of good faith. Just then the other
bunko man appeared, and after being
.ntroduced as one of the firm of lumber
merchants, proceeded to question
Becker as to whether or not he had
any money. The foolish young man
told him he had $500 in bank, and of
fered to furnish that amount as a
guarantee that he would be true to his
employers.
The schemers told him to call on the
following day, when definite arrange
ments would Â»Â»â¢ made to put him to
work. Becker showed op at the ap
pointed time and was met by one of
the bunko men. The latter told him
k would be necessar- fur him to fur
nish the $500 guarantee before he could
3ut him to work. Becker, thinking that
le was about to secure a good position,
took the schemer to the bank, where
ne had deposited his money, and drew
t out. After leaving the bank
Becker, at the request of his friend,
iurned the money over to him.
They walked along Montgomery street,
and when the Lick House was reached
:he stranger said he was anxious to see
i friend and asked Becker to wait until
ac returned. After waiting a long time
:he young man, realizing he had been
robbed, informed the first policeman he
net.
The latter took him to police head
quarters, where he was turned over to
Captain Seymour. The latter, after
.istening to his story, detailed Detec
:ives Ryan and ODea to find the bunko
jien. Last night the detectives, after
i thorough investigation, concluded
:hat one of the men Is a well-known
confidence operator named Rounds. He
svas arrested a short time ago for rob
bing an unsuspecting stranger, but es
raped being convicted in fhe Police
I^ourt.
Becker describes the older of the two
is being about 50 years of age and has
a deep scar on his left cheek. The
Dther is about 30 years of age and was
fashionable dressed. He believes he
ran identify them, in case they are ar
rested.

POISON FOR BROMO-SELTZER.
THOMAS GRIFFIN Given a Dose of Morphine to Steady His
Nerves.
Thomas Griffin, a middle-aged man, who is employed as teamster by the
Union Ice Company, walked into the Receiving Hospital yesterday morning and
declared that he had been poisoned. As he showed symptoms of morphine poi
soning the doctor in charge administered an antidote. Griffin seemed to grow
worse, and for a time it was thought he would die. Last night he recovered
sufficiently to tell his story. He claimed he entered a saloon at Geary and Lar
kin streets, and as he was feeling badly he asked the bartender to give him
something to "brace him up," as he expressed it. The bartender took a package
out of his pocket, and. tossing it to Griffin, told him to help himself. "That will
do you good," he remarked, "but look out you do not take too much of It." Grif
fin thinking that the package contained bromo-seltzer, poured the contents into
a glass of whisky and swallowed it. The bartender was busy at the time, but
when Griffin told him he had taken the entire dose he advised him to go to the
hospital. . .. tMt
"You have taken twenty-four grains of morphine," he remarked; that Btunr
I gave you was morphine.
Griffin lost no time in visiting the hospital, where he was relieved of a por
tion of the poison. Last night he was in a precarious condition, and the doctors
gave as their opinion that he could not possibly recover.
After being informed of the cause of Griffin's illness Captain Seymour or
dered Detective Ed Gibson to make a thorough investigation. He visited the sa
loon, and after obtaining the statement of Edward Pringle, the proprietor, took
him to the Receiving Hospital for the purpose of having Griffin identify him.
After scrutinizing him Griffin said he was not the man who gave him the poison.
Pringle however, declared that he waited on Griffin. He claims that the latter
visited his saloon and called for a glass of whisky. After drinking It he went
into a rear room, where he says he took the poison.
Captain Seymour is making an investigation, and if Griffin's story is true he
intends to arrest the bartender for supplying Griffin with morphine.
DANCING MASTER IN TROUBLE.
George Colvan Arrested for Threats
Against Life.
Professor George H. Colvan, who con
ducts a dancing school at Native Sons"
Hall, on Seventeenth street, was arrested
last night on complaint of Mrs. Alma
Wallen, who charged him with threats
against life.
Mrs. Wallen alleges that she loaned
Professor Colvan $500 with which he ,
started his dancing school. A short time
ago she discovered that he was a mar
ried man and immediately demanded her â 
money back. Colvan refused fo return
it, she claims, and he threatened to kill â 
her. Mrs. Wallen was not prepared to
die, so she repaired to Judge Low, and i
told him her troubles. The judge listened i
with kindly ear, and issued a warrant
MASONS IN REVELRY FOR CHARITY
THOSE who support the cause of charity in San Francisco are numbered by the many thousands. The
gold this multitude gives with lavish hand is also measured in dollars by the thousand, and without doubt
when the Masonic fete is closed an amount sufficient to build the home for the widows and orphans will have
been realized. An exceptionally good programme was rendered last evening, and to-day one equally entertain
ing has been prepared.
In the afternoon Bennett's band entertained the audience, but in the evening many other features were added.
The dancing of prettily robed workers for a laudable cause was heartily cheered before and after each merry whirl.
The pigeon dance, quite a departure from time-worn fancy dances, was very interesting. The participants, the staff
from the postoffk-e booth, robed in white, the ladies' heads bedecked with doves white as the driven snow, marched to
the stage to a stirring tune and mingled in the mazes of the dance. A rolling, graceful motion of the bodies of the
dancers, the formation of many figures, posing in striking attitudes, completedthe pigeon dance, and the participants
left the stage. The applause following the effort of the dancers had not died away when those who were to dance
the stately "Minuet de Mozart" appeared wending their way to the stage. They were soon there, and the dance
commenced. With graceful bows and steps each dancer amid a storm of applause made a farewell courtesy and
marched away.
Prior to the dancing, which was the most interesting feature of the evening, the members of the Olympic Club
gave an exhibition. Skillful fencers and clever wrestlers pitted against each other entertained the many guests of
the Masons, and the victors and the vanquished were alike filled with pride at the ovation given them.
The many fascinating booths still draw their crowds, and the money they make each night even surpasses the
expectations of the management of the festival. This afternoon and this evening a greater crowd than ever is ex
pected. In the evening a chorus of luo male voices will be the feature, and the management says that it will be a
feature that few can afford to miss. Following is to-day's programme:

which was served last night Just as the
dance was about to begin.
Colvan denies that he ever borrowed
money from the woman, but claims that
they were very friendly, until he dis
covered that she was a divorcee. He
then Jilted her. and, according to his
story, she threatened to ruin him. After
spending a couple of hours in the Seven
teenth-street station Colvan was released
on his own recognizance.

Huntington Throws Some Light on
the Manner in Which He Has
Won Riches.
Collis P. Huntington experienced sev
eral short periods of great mental dis
comfort yesterday, but in the main he ;
managed to dodge a majority of the ques
tions put to him by Attorney Hayne re
gardlng the cost, profits, expense of ope- |
rating and manner qf conducting the af
fairs of the Southern Pacific Company.
Between his evasions and equivocations
he sandwiched In some good advice to
young men who wish to become million
aires by their own exertions, as well as
some caustic criticisms of the acts of the
men who were associated with him in the
building of the Central Pacific Railroad.
Of the late Senator Stanford he said:
"He was as straight a man as there was
in California In all matters with which he
was connected, outside of politics."
â¢ When asked what he meant by his ref
erence to the political acts of his former
partner Huntington took refuge behind
the statement that he had never been in
politics, and was therefore unable to

Attorney Hayne, who conducted the ex- 1
amination. recurred to the matter of the
cost of operating the roads of the South
ern Pacific system. Huntington expressed i
a desire to comply with the request for j
information, but declared that he pos- j
sensed no further knowledge of the sub
ject than that set forth In the annual
statements made for the benefit of stock
holders.
"I made up my mind," he said, "a great
many years ago that a man can do but
one thing and do it well. I know a few
things about the rough outside work of
building railroads, but I am Ignorant of j
the details of bookkeeping. The details
of cost and expenditure are a matter of !
bookkeeping. I am content with the ag- !
gregates."
"Will you produce the books of the |
company in court su that we can ascer- |
tain the details for ourselves?"
"As the president of the company I !
should say that the books could not be j
brought into court."
"Will you tlu-n furnish us a statement
taken from the books?"
"If the court should order It I suppose
wa should have to try, but I don't think
we should compiy with any morÂ» strin
gent request unless our legal advisers
Bald it was the proper thing to do. We
might give experts a chance to see the ;
books, but I don't think we would go any !
further."
Huntington gave it as his opinion that ;

We've gained a leadership In beddingsâ a specialty of Sheets and Pillow Cases. The com-
bined order of our California stores on Beddings is probably bigger than any store west of Chicago.
We buy of the manufacturer in wholesale lots for cash. We buy in bulk for six â take every
discountâ gain at every turnâ skip the jobber and sell to you at the price the average merchant has
to pay the middleman. You save the jobber's profit if you buy at Hales. ** -â¢

New York Mills Sheets.
The most popular sheet on our counter is the "New York
Mills." Some time since we purchased an. immense stock at a
low figure. They were not bleached pure white 'although it
takes an expert to notice the difference), and consequently sold
as "seconds." We have only two sizes left, which will he closed

"Under present conditions, he said,
"railroad companies are forced to favor
some localities and individuals or firms,
and to make up their losses on others.
We don't do it-at least I have given pos
itive orders to our people not to do it.
"Is this scheme of wholesale consolida
tion one of the things that you are try
i^lt t Â°wa 11 s n !. l ftT t hav c given It up tem
porarily. I shall do nothing until the
! present race of demagogues is dead, lhe
! execution of such a scheme would be of
! great benefit to the lower classes. I have
I been a hard-working man all of my 'Jfo
and I have a great deal of sympathy ror
"What about the clause in the lease of
the Central Pacific road to the Southern
Pacific which says that one road may not
be benefited at the expense of the other.
"It means just what it says. It strikes
me that it should be good law. I know
1 that it is good morals. As to other com
peting mads the conditions are changed.
' If, on account of competition, we lose
i money to one point we are forced to make
i it up at other points where there is no
I competitionâ legally, of course. I make
this assertion as a finnaclal man who has
always paid his debts. It is the only way
: to do business unless you expect to go
into bankruptcy."
"Has the Southern Pacific Company any
pooling arrangement with any of the
California steamship lines?"
"I am not sure, but I think it has not.
I think it would he well to have some
such an arrangement. I will speak to
our people about it."
Huntington admitted that the Central
Pacific Company had paid to its stock
holders dividends amounting to about $34,
000.000.
"Why did you not take this money and
pay the debts owed by the road to the
Government?" was asked.
"We didn't care bo much about the Gov
ernment. We preferred to invest the
money hero in California. The Govern
ment has already been paid twice over by
the advantages it derived from the build
ing of the road."
The witness stated thAt he thought it
very unwise for Stanford to draw $2,000.
000 out of the Contract and Finance Com
pany to establish the Palo Alto stock
farm.
"It was not good business policy," he
said. "At that time I was living very
close. In New York I us^d to walk every
day eight or ninf blocks to get a street
car rnthor than pny 2o cents for a ride on
the omnibus that passed my office. When
Stanford was fitting up his costly stock
farm T was building a house that cost me
$58,000. The week after it was completed
1 was offered $75,000 for it. Thatisthoway
I did business. I never put any money in
where I was not sure that I could
realize a profit on the investment at any
time I wanted to sell."

o'clock this afternoon.
