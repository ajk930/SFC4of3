NINETY-NINE LIVES GO OUT WITH
THE WRECKING OF THE PORTLAND
IGHLAND LIGHT, Mass., Nov. 28.â (Delayed in trans
â mission.) â The steamer Portland of the Boston and Port
land line, has been lost on Cape Cod, with all on board.
The life saving men, through a blinding storm, yesterday
morning at 6 o'clock, heard the distress whistle of a steamer and
last night at midnight the body of a man was found on shore. On
the body of the man was a life belt marked "Steamer Portland of
Portland." A gold watch in his pocket had stopped at 10 o'clock.
This man was well dressed, wore black clothes and tan shoes, had
light hair and mustache and a piece of card in his pocket bore the
words "J onn W., Congress street, Portland."
The body of a large woman, without covering of any kind,
was washed ashore at Pamet River, but there was no means of iden
tifying it.
It is believed that the steamer Portland was disabled by the
storm at 10 o'clock last night, being unable longer to hold up
against the gale, and drifted onto Peaked Hill bars and went to
pieces. No part of the ship had drifted ashore and it is not
known just where she struck. Boxes of tobacco, clothing, cheese,
oil, etc. have been washed ashore, also life preservers marked
with the words "Steamer Portland."
BOSTON, Nov. 29. â Dr. Maurice Richardson of Beacon
street, this city, was at his summer home at Wellfleet during the
storm arid corroborated the early accounts of the loss of the Port
land, for he saw two of the bodies washed ashore and on them
were life preservers marked with the vessel's name. Dr. Richard
son was on the first train from Cape Cod, which arrived in this
city late to-night.
"I saw two of the bodies picked up," said Dr. Richardson.
"One was probably that of a deckhand, a man of about 20. He
had on a life preserver marked 'Portland.' The other body was
that of a stout woman. She. too, wore a life belt with the steam
er's name on it. Wreckage is coming ashore for fifteen miles
along the coast. Among the wreckage were cases of lard directed
to Portland."
In addition to the two bodies, Dr. Richardson brought news
that at Orleans the body of a girl of about 20 was found. She
had a gold watch and a ring marked "J- G - E -" Her watch sap
ped at 9:17. There are three bodies at Nauset, eight at Orleans
and twenty-eight at Truro and Wellfleet. The double wheel of the
Portland came ashore at Orleans.
The Portland was built in 1890 in Bath, Me., and was a side
wheel steamer of 13 17 net tons burden. Her length is 230 feet,
beam 4^ and depth 15 feet. She mrtm valued at $250,000, an â ) is
fully insured.
TWELVE BODIES WASHED
ASHORE AT CAPE COD
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â The French
cable company has received a dispatch
from its office at Cape Cod. Mass., say
ing that twelve bodies from the steamer
Portland have been washed ashore at
that station.
PROVINCETOWN, Mass., Nov. 29.â
Two bodies that came ashore at High
land Light, and are supposed to be
from the Portland have been brought
here. One is that of a well dressed man.
The other body is that of a woman
with only shoea and stockings on.
WORCESTER, Mass.. Nov. 29.âWil
liam L. Chase, who with his son Philip
was a passenger on the Portland, was
chief in the draughtsman department
in the Crompton-Knowles Loom Works,
and secretary of the Alumni Association
of Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
TWENTY-SEVEN WRECKS
NEAR PROVINCETOWN
PROVINCETOWN, Mass., Nov. 29.â
Twenty-seven vessels were driven
ashore and totally wrecked in this
neighborhood. From the majority of
these the crews were saved, although
several lives were lost. Four or five
of the wrecks were coasters, and the
rest were fishermen. During th storm
shipping was destroyed and the beach
was strewn with wreckage, streets
were flooded and wharves drifted out
to sea. Four ice houses and a lobster
hatchery situated at Beach Point were
destroyed.
The list of casualties includes the
schooners Daniel Boone, Mary Cabral,
Isaac Collins, the steamer A. B. Nicker
son of Provincetown; the schooners
f'lara Sayward of Gloucester, Sylvester
Whalen of Boston, F. P. Foster and F.
H. Smith of Provincetown, and the
fishing schooner Unique of Boston.
Fragments of the schooner R. Walker
of Gloucester and the coaster Addie E.
Snow of Rockland, Me., drifted ashore
at Race Point this afternoon. Flour,
pork, lard and whisky barrels have
been drifting ashore along the beach
between Race Point and Highland
Light life-saving station to-day.
Several bodies have drifted ashore
near Highland Light, and part of a
boat marked "Steamer Portland."
The Wood Island life savers made
several gallant c-fforts yesterday to
reach the schooner Jordan L. Mott,
bound from New York to Rockland
with coal, and finally succeeded. The
Mott put in here on the 2Cth for a har
bor, and sank early the same night.
The captain and crew of five men
took to the rigging. A terrible sea
and gale prevailed at the time. The
captain, Charles F. Dyer, lashed his
father, C. G. Dyer, who acted as stew
ard, to the mast. For eighteen hours
they were exposed thus before assist
ance arrived. When the Wood Island
crew made its successful launcti and
came within hailing distance of the
Mott Captain Dyer said: .
"I can hold on. Save my crew. My
father is frozen to death at the mast.
Do not wait to cut his body down, for
the men are freezing."
The three-masted schooner Lester A;
Lewis, Captain Kimball, from Eliza
bethport, N. J., for Bangor with a car
go of phosphate and guano, came in
shortly after the Mott and Captain
Dyer thinks both capsized and sank at
about the same ti ne. The captain and
crew of the Lewis perished.
The Peaked Hill life-saving station
reports the schooner Albert L. Butler,
Captain Leland. from Black River, Ja
maica, for Boston, went ashore one
mile east of the life-saving station at
10 o clock in the forenoon. The captain
The San Francisco Call
and four men were saved. Mate Rath
burne. Sailor Offlander and a colored
passenger named Wetherburn were
drowned. The Butler is a total loss.
THREE LIVES LOST IN
THE SAWYER WRECK
VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass., Nov. 29.
Three lives were lost in the wreck of
the schooner Sawyer, which was
wrecked on the north side of the island.
The dead are:
Captain Norwood.
Cook Anzever.
Seaman Lander Ashley.
Mate Dudley and Seaman Tapley
were saved.
The Sawyer, which was bound from
Calais, Me., for New York, with lum
ber, anchored off Falmouth, Mass., for
shelter Saturday evening, but the gale
increased with such fury that the ves
sel broke adrift and was driven across
Vineyard Sound and cast ashore. When
the vessel struck Captain Norwood was
washed overboard and his body was
thrown upon the beach shortly after
ward by the heavy seas. The bodies
of the cook and the seaman were re
covered.
The British schooners, Tay and
Rondo, lost all their masts and are full
of water. These schooners were seri
ously damaged. Flora Condon, Hattie
Howes, Henrietta Simmons, Morenci,
Leonard Walters, Lugano, A.
Pierce.
The schooner William Todd was
fouled and sunk by an unknown barge.
The Carrita was wrecked on the east
side of the harbor. The Lunett, from
Perth Amboy with coal, went on the
rocks at Tarpaulin Cove. The Cathie
C. Berry is ashore at Edgerton. The
cargo of lime of the stranded E. C.
Willard took fire to-night and the ves
sel was totally destroyed. The Succon
set Lightship has been damaged and
moved from its former position.

GATE CITY MAY
HAVE GONE DOWN
BOSTON, Nov. 29.â The arrival in
this city from Cape Cod to-night of a
party of hunters has added to the ex
citement attendant upon the report that
the steamer Portland had been wrecked
on Cape Cod, through their reporting
that it is the belief of the life savers
on the other side of the cape, south
of Nauset Light, that a Savannah line
steamer had struck on Peaked Hill
bars. Each member of the party saw
bodies washed arhore at Nauset, and
the life saverÃ claimed to have seen a
board in the surf bearing the name
"Gate City." The surf is full of articles
from a vessel's general cargo.
One of the hunters, in an interview
to-riight, says that there is a possibility
that the Gate City was only swept by
the seas and some of her deck fittings
were washed away. The Gate City
sailed from this port for the south on
Saturday.
BOSTON, Nov. 30.â Advices from
Highland Light on the extremity of
Cape Cod, received at 2 a. m this
(Wednesday) morning, do not indicate
that the Gate City was wrecked off
there Saturday night.
BLOCK ISLAND IS

NEW ENGLAND'S COAST
STREWN WITH CORPSES
AND WRECKED VESSELS
BOSTON, Nov. 29.â The passing hours do not bring an end to the reports of wrecks and loss of life up
and down the New England coast, as the outcome of Sunday's terrific storm. From Cape Cod the most terrible
accounts of ruin and death are coming, and of these the loss of the steamer Portland, with all on board, near
ly 100 souls, overshadows all. The graveyard of the coast, the treacherous bars and rips on the outside of
Cape Cod, have claimed victims without number. Miles and miles of coast line is piled high with wreckage,
most of which is ground so fine by the waves that identification of helpless craft is impossible.
As the fury of the Wind was as great on the bleak sandhills which make up the cape, it will be many
hours before all places are heard from. Telegraph wires are down and railroads cannot break out of the
snow drifts. This feature is distressing, as much suffering from cold and hunger must ensue among the
poor people in the nearby hamlets. To-night the only means of reaching Cape Cod is by steamer across
Massachusetts Bay, a disagreeable voyage, as the sea is yet boisterous.
Word from Provincetown tells of nearly thirty total wrecks, with the number of lives lost unknown.
Matters are improving slightly along Vineyard Sound, so far as means of communication is concerned.
The best summing up of the disasters in that section is made by Captain Hard Jr. of the revenue cutter
Dexter, who has cruised along the shore all day. He says that in Vineyard Haven hulls are piled upon the
ghore, and those vessels which are afloat seem mere shells. The Dexter reports possible additions to the wreck
list in two schooners sunk of Menemsha Light and two big ones sunk abreast Presque Isle. The fate of the
crews is unknown. Three wrecking steamers are around the Fairfax, ashore on Sow and Pigs Reef.
It is difficult to estimate the total loss .of life and damage to shipping along this coast. The list of dis
asters seems to grow every hour, and from dispatches thus far received it appears that at least thirty
schooners have been wrecked at different points from Eastport, Me., to New Haven, Conn. Eighty schooners
have been driven ashore, and sixteen barges, loaded or empty, are aground.
This list does not include the thirty vessels either wholly or partially wrecked in Boston harbor, nor
half a dozen or more craft which are reported missing, including the Wilson Line freighter Ohio, which is
ashore on Spectacle Island. In this harbor the steamer John J. Hill is ashore at Atlantic; the Merchants'
and Miners' transportation steamer Fairfax is ashore on Sow and Pigs Ledge; off Cuttyhunk, north; a small
steamer, George Chaff ee, foundered at Rockport, Mass. When these are added the list exceeds 110 vessels.
The loss of life is hard to determine. It is known that about fifty persons perished in and about Boston
Harbor. Reports from other places in some cases state that the crew of this or that vessel escaped. Many,
however, state that the fate of the crew is unknown. Some survivors have turned up, and life-saving stations
and incoming vessels have brought a few sailors from wrecks. Perhaps a score would cover those of whom
nothing is known, not including those who were on board the Portland.
THE GREAT STORM.
40.06, longitude 71.16. The vessel was
a bark or barkentine. No signals could
be made out from the Martello, which
was about five miles to the north of the
wreck. Soon afterward a steamer was
seen going toward the wrecked craft.
The steamer is thought to have been a
Hogan liner bound for Baltimore.
The steamer Comanche, from Jack
sonville and Charleston, reached port
about ten hours late owing to the
storm. She reports that about a mile
north of Northeast End lightship she
passed a spar standing out of the wa
ter and attached to a sunken vessel.
Off Martins Industry light two float
ing wrecks, apparently bottom up, were
passed.
Reports are coming in of wrecks
about the north and east shores of
Long Island. An unknown three
masted schooner is ashore on Old Fields
Reef with two masts gone. Another
schooner is ashore on the sound beach
near Miller's place. The schooner Ob
server is ashore at Port Jefferson and is
a total wreck. The schooner Olive
Leaf was also wrecked and will prove
a total loss. Darlings wharf was badly
damaged.
The schooner Everett with a cargo of
brick foundered off Shelter Island
Heights, and the crew had a narrow
escape from drowning.
The schooner Reganet was wrecked
off Long Beach light. The crew after
suffering from exposure and want of
food for thirty-six hours was finally
rescued in an exhausted condition. The
men lost all their personal effects.
Three sloops are sunk at Orient.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 29.â Every Re
publican Assemblyman from Southern
California will cast his vote for Assem
blyman H. E. Wright of Alameda
County for Speaker. This decision
was reached this afternoon at a cau
cus of legislators from seven Southern
counties. Every Assemblyman was
present except Meruth of Santa Bar- j
bara. An organisation which will be
permanent was perfected by the elec
tion of W. S. Melick of the Seventieth
District as. chairman, and Assembly
man Crowder of the Eightieth District
as secretary. As to the Spoakership
there was no dissension, and the unani- j
moua decision to support Mr. Wright
was reached at once.
The caucus indorsed L. H. alentine
of the Seventy-fourth District for
chairman of the Assembly Committee
on Ways and Means.
An Informal discussion was indulged
in during the caucus as to the positions
of several members from this section
desired on committees: Mr. Wright, in
discussing the matter, said:
"There are sixty Republican members
of the Assembly, and there are but
thirty-five chairmanships of commit
tees to give out. If I am chosen
Sneaker I shall give preference in
chairmanships to such memhers as I
believe can best perform the duties I
that will be committed to their charge.
This I believe to be the part of wisdom,
and in my judgment the business of the
session will thereby be greatly expe
dited.
"I feel highly complimented by the
action of the Republican members from
Southern California in indorsing me
fnr the Speakerthlp. I shall endeavor.
If I am chosen, to give to the interests
of this section of the State every con
sideration 1 possibly can."
The Times this morning discussed
Colonel Burns" Senatorial aspirations j
editorially as follows:.
If a serious and concerted effort is to I
be made to foist Dan Burns upon the peo- ;
pie of California as th^ir representative !
in the Senate by Huntington's henchmen
or by any other clique or faction, the Re- !
publicans of the State cannot too soon |
rally for the defeat of so unwise and im- ;
politic an object. The antecedents of |
Dan Burns are such that it i.s impossible
to have confidence in h!s integrity of pur
pose. His reputation is that of- a politi
cal boss ami intriguer, and his political
methods arr> always open to distrust. He ;
is a professional politician, a believer in
gang politics and an unscrupulous prac
tloer of gang politics. He is utterly un- j
fit for the high and responsible office of i
Senator of the United States, and his
election to that office would be a great i
misfortune not only to the State of Cali
fornia, but to the country at large.
STEAMER DETROIT
STRIKES A REEF
Passengers on the Alaska Craft Es-
cape to Shelter Island's
Bleak Shore.
JUNEAU, Alaska. Nov. 23 (by steam
ship Cottage City to Victoria, Nov. 29).â
Three men, drenched and bedraggled,
walked into Juneau to-night, bringing the
news of another lost ship. Shipwrecks
continue to pile up in Alaska like drift
wood on a beach. The men were Purser
Bush and two of the crew of the steamer
D<-troit, a local boat running between
Juneau and Lynn Canal ports. The furi
ous windstorm which has been blowing
for nearly a week, in which the steamer
Utopia narrowly escaped becoming a total
â¢wreck, subsided on Tuesday night, and
wa.s succeeded by a snowfall so thick that
it was impossible to see much more than
a ship's length. The Detroit loft Juneau
for Halnes Mission and Skaguay a week
ago. She usually goes up one day and
comes down the next. Fears have been
felt for her safety ever since she left here,
owing to the violent storm, but she lay
under the lee of an island until the storm
had spent itself and then started again for
Skaguay. She made Skagttay in safety,
only to be wrecked on the return trip
Bcarce thirty miles from her dock.
The Detroit struck at about noon on
Thanksgiving day. The snowfall being
unusually thick. Captain Latham, instead
of being well out in the channel, was close
in to Shelter Island. This island is sur
rounded by roofs. In [ess time than it
takee to write it the ship was tearing and
grinding on a reef hidden by high tide.
The passengers were thrown from their
seats to the floor and panic spread
through the ship. But the Detroit was
hard and fast and did not sink, though
she filled rapidly with water.
The position of the ship alone saved the
passengers from drowning like rats. They
were put ashore in the ship's boats and as
much of the ship's stores as had not been
ruined by water were saved. Tho De
troit left Skaguay with twenty-three pas
sengers. They are now camped in the
timber of Shelter Island, poorly protected
from the weather and short of provisions.
A tent was rigged of a tarpaulin and the
blankets and bedding taken ashore. At
last accounts passengers and crew were
shivering around a fire, eating cold food
and trying to make coffee. Their situa
tion was very critical as well as uncom
fortable. The Detroit lies in a bad posi
tion and it is doubtful whether she can be
saved. She is owned by the Seattle Land
and Wharf Company, is about seventy
feet long and a double decker.

MAY HAVE BUT ONE
INAUGURAL BALL
Prospect of Harmony in the Enter
tainment of Governor-Elect
Gage at Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 29.â A peace con
ference between the inaugural ball com
mittee, appointed as a result of a meet
ing of citizens, of which R. T. Devlin is
chairman, and Mayor Land, represent
ing the rival faction, was held this after
noon. As a result there is a prospect of
harmonizing the entertainers of the Gov
ernor-elect and giving him a ball which
will be of such brilliance as to make the
head of the executive swim.
It will be remembered that Mayor Land
found fault with the manner in which the
movement was started, insisting that he
he should have been chosen chairman
because of his official position. Mr. Dev
lin, chairman of the committee, however,
proceeded to name his associates, of
whom the Mayor was designated as one
The Mayor would not have this and
called a meeting of his own, which pro
claimed itself the only authorized body
to proceed with the inaugural.
The Impracticability of having two in
augural balls and putting the Governor
elect to the necessity of being at both at
the same time induced the Mayor and
Mr. Devlin's committee to confer to-day,
with the result that each side assured
the other of its distinguished considera
tion: but after an executive committee is
publicly named it is hard to dismiss it.
and Mayor Land does not need all of
Mr. Devlin's committee in order to com
plete his own.
The flavor's faction was to have met
to-night, but both sides adjourned until
Friday night, by which time all hands will
doubtless be posted as to what will be
good form in such a social exigency as
the present.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 29.-The bien
nial report of the State Board of Prison
Directors for the two years ending June
30, IS9B, to which Director WHkins has
been devoting a good deal of time and
careful consideration for several weeks,
was finished and forwarded to Gover
nor Budd to-day. The document is ex
ceedingly important in its nature and
supplies interesting reading, inasmuch
as attention is drawn to various re
forms needed at both Folsom and San
Quentin. .
The attention of the executive is
drawn to the fact that, while the dis
cipline enforced at the two prisons will
compare favorably with that of any
similar institution in the country, vari
ous reforms are possible which cannot
be put into operation under existing
conditions. The chief of these, a clas
sification of prisoners, is spoken of as
follows:
Foremost among these is a careful
classification of prisoners and the abso ute
s -Kr. k\c ion of the totally depraved class
from those who are young in vice and
with whom there is a reasonable hope of
final reformation. To carry out our views
In this direction would involve the con
struction of new cell buildings, the intro
duction of new industries and a heavy ex
penditure of money. Probably it is a
larger question from a financial stand
point than the people are prepared to re
gard favorably in their present mood.
In connection with the reformation of
prisoners we call your attention to the
parole, law. We have exercised the au
thority conferred upon us by this act
with the utmost caution and have endeav
ored to expand its provisions to applicants
worthy of our confidence. It Is true that
our expectations have been disappointed
in some instances, but on the whole the
results have been most satisfactory.
Fully SO per cent of paroled prisoners are
leading industrious and honorable lives, a
fact that should go far toward removing:
the remaining prejudice against a proper
exercise of this law.
The opium traffic, toward which pub
lic attention has been frequently at
tracted by The Call, the directors are
frank to admit is still carried on in
ppite of the utmost vigilance on the
part of the prison officials. On this
subject the report reads:
A mischievous and demoralizing factor
with which we are forced to contend is
the prevalent opium habit among large
bodies of convicts, especially at San Quen
tin prison. Your board has made the most
strenuous efforts to suppress the traffic
in this drug-, in which we have had the
hearty co-operation of subordinate offi
cials, "yet we must confess that we have
not been wholly successful. It is due in
a largft part to the fact that our Legisla
ture has failed to make the Introduction
of opium into our prisons a penal offense,
though repeatedly urged to do so. Were
a Bufflvifntiy severe punishment certain
fnr those detected in The nefarious busj
diss. we would be in a much better posi
tion to deal with this great evil.
The board earnestly advocates as a
question of pressing urgency proper ac
commodations for the care of the crim
inal insane and details the results of
the conference with a committee from
the State Lunacy Commission. Folsom
is selected as the preferable site for the
construction of a ward for the criminal
insane, because it offers the advantages
of free light and water and because the
granite quarries there and the presence
of a large force of unemployed convicts
will tend to make the cost of construc
tion a comparatively small item.
The indeterminate sentence system,
as employed in other States more ad
vanced in the science of penology, is
recommended for favorable considera
tion by the Legislature. It is asserted
that in California men are released
from prison daily who have learned no
lesson from confinement or discipline
and confessedly go out to prey again
upon society. It Is thought that in the
majority of cases a much better result
would be attained if sentences were not
for a fixed limit, but were made within
certain limits, dependent upon evidence
of reformation.
The jute industry is mentioned as on
a most satisfactory basis, but 3,000,000
bags have been carried over on account
of short crops. Enough have been
marketed to fill the revolving fund oÂ£
$100,000 and permit the retention of
enough money for present operating ex
penses.
The board regrets to be obliged to
mention the fact that the rock crusher
at Folsom has had so few orders that
business may be deemed at a minimum.
The necessity of providing profitable
employment for the prisoners is urgeo,
and it is recommended that experience
with a small tract of arable land dem
onstrates that it would b.e a wise move
on the part of the Legislature to pur
chase a large tract of land near the
prison, the working of which wouid
give the convicts employment and go
far toward making the prison self-sup
porting. The board does not believe this
would interfere with free labor, for
such staple products could be raised as
would not compete in price with any
body.
Nearly eight miles of the Tlburon
boulevard have been completed by con
vict labor.. The board is especially
proud of the showing made oa that
road.
The board takes pride in the Tact that
the prisons have been conducted on
lines of strict economy, ho far as the
bpst interests of the State would per
mit. Not only has that body lived with
in the appropriations made by the Leg
islature, but it has saved enough to
make a number of much-neederi per
manent Improvements, among which
are mentioned the new kitchen, with
modern cooking plant, and the new
prison wharf.

OAKLAND TO GET A NEW
POSTOFFICE BUILDING
Good Prospects of Congress Acting
on a Bill for the Necessary
Appropriation.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 29.âRepresenta
tive Mercer of Nebraska, chairman of
the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, says he expects Congress to
authorize several new public buildings at
the coming session. There are scores of
bills for new buildings, but Mr. Mercer
says an effort will be made to authorize
structures where there is a very pressing
demand for them. He will call a meet-
Ing of his committee early in the session.
During the last session this committee
refused to report a single bill for new
buildings. This was attributable to tlie
lack of funds in the treasury, but now
that the coffers are full. Speaker Rs^d
will probably give his consent to more
liberal appropriations of this kind, ben
ator Perkins has already passed through
the Senate several times a bill for a new
poPtofflce at Oakland. Congressman Hll
born. although a member of the commit
tee, did not succeed in getting the bill
reported from the House committee, but
hopes to be more successful this ses
sion.
MORE RAIN IS NEEDED.
Weather and Crop Conditions in
Southern California.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 29.-The climate
and crop bulletin of the Weather Bureau
for Southern California for the week end-
Ing November 28 follows:
Cool, fair weather prevailed all the af
ternoon of the 24th, when light showers
fell in some of the southern sections, and
snow in the mountains back of Redlands.
The rain was followed by a severe
"norther" during the night of the 24th
and the greater portion of the 2otn. Ino
greatest force of the wind was experi
enced in the foothills region, though high
northerly winds prevailed generally. The
reports from the sections where the
"norther" prevailed state that damage
resulted from the high wind to trees and
citrus fruit, but on the whole the injury
was light.
Farm work generally continued Inac
tive, awaiting good, soaking rains to put
the soil in condition for cultivating,
though some- dry seeding is being done
in the hope of sufficient rain later tc ma
ture a crop.
Some oranges are being shipped for the
holiday trade, though they are not yet
ripe.
DE YOUNG DWELLING
ENTERED BY BURGLARS
Unsuccessful Attempt to Loot the
Editor's Summer Home at
San Rafael.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 29.â An unsuccess
ful attempt was made this evening by two
burglars to loot the summer residence of
M. H. de Young. The attempt was frus
trated by the presence of John Meyer, a
gardener".
Meyer sleeps in a room in the lower
part of the house. He was awakened by
hearing the men ascending the stairway
to the upper floor. He slipped out through
the front door, which had been left
opened, and saw a light in an upper
room. Meyer hastened to Coroner Eden's
residence and summoned officers.
Marshal John Healy and Night Watch
man Peter O'Brien responded to the call.
When they reached the residence the
burglars had gone, having taken alarm
from the. noise made by Meyer on leav
ing the house.
Meyer is unable to state whether or not
the bur^iars obtained any booty.
WANTS THE EDUCATORS.
Tacom,a's Efforts to Secure the Na-
tional Convention.
TAC'OMA, Nov. 29.â Tacoma is making
strenuous efforts to secure next year's
meeting of the American Educational
Association, Vhich is expected to bring
20,000 educators to the Pacific coast. As
matters now stand Los Angeles is the only
other contestant. The executive commit
tee of the national association will meet
in Chicago on December 15 to decide
whether the convention shall come to Ta
coma or go to Southern California. Taco
ma has nearly raised the $20,000 needed to
entertain the convention. Arrangements
are complete for the erection of a pavilion
of 5000 seating capacity, made necessary
by the recent burning of the Exposition
building. Hotel accommodations will be
augmented by throwing open thousands of
homes if the convention comes here.
JOHNSON AS PLAINTIFF.
Sues for Damages Because He Was
Robbed at a Hotel.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.â The suit of
Grove L. Johnson, a former member of
Congress from California, against George
W. Cochran, proprietor of the Hotel Coch
ran, for $1257, alleged damages for losses
suffered by the former while b guest at
the hotel, was begun to-day in the Circuit
Court.
The suit is the result of Johnson's rooms
at the Hotel Cochran being robbed on the
evening of December 11, 18& C, while be and
his family were at supper. During his
absence from his room $453 In cash, and
Jewelry belonging to his wife valued at
$804 was stolen from his apartments.
The defense is that the proprietor of
the hotel is not liable for goods lost, be
cause in the rooms occupied by Johnson
and his family there were notices posted
tailing the attention of guests to the fact
that he would not be responsible for the
safety of valuables unless left with the
clerk of the hotel and locked in the safe.
PRIVATE HOLT WILL DIE.
Sentenced to Be Executed for a Mur
der Committed While Drunk.
HUNTSVILLE, Ala., Nov. 29.â Private
Lindsay P. Holt, Troop F. Tenth United
States Cavalry, now encamped here. Is
resting under a death sentence, the result
of a court-martial, at which it was proven
that he was guilty of murder. The origin
of this man's trouble is easiest told in tht)
words, "bad whisky and a pistol." His
best friend was his victim, and the unfor
tunate man's remorse is awful.
This is the first death sentence passed
upon an enlisted man since the beginning
or the war and for many years previous.
It is attracting widespread attention.

SILLY NEWSPAPER ARTICLE
DECLARED WORKINGMEN WERE
STARVING.
Citizens Angered by an Examiner
"Pipe-Dream" Following the
Recent Fire in the
Carshops.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 29.â A space
writer in the San Francisco Examiner
last Sunday covered an entire page
with an industrious effort to have the
publlc"believe that Sacramento is like
ly to overlook the celebration of the
approaching Christmas because a fire
at the railroad shops of the Southern
Pacific Company recently destroyed
a small portion of the plant and tem
porarily threw out of employment a
fraction of the force of mechanics. The
story is luridly illustrated, an at
tempt being made by the artist to de
pict such a scene of domestic misery as
might be encountered among the strik
ing coke burners of Pennsylvania, but
which nobody but a hysterical illus
trator for a yellow Sunday supplement
could locate in a prosperous commun
ity like Sacramento.
As a matter of fact, as has been told
in dispatches to The Call, the effects of
the flre have not been such a- to cause
any serious distress. Nearly all of
the men whom the fire compelled the
railroad company to drop temporarily
from the payroll were skilled mechan
ics, earning good wages and living in
comfortable homes. Putting a speech
In the mouth of one of these citizens
about the dreaded poverty which the
winter is to bring down upon his house
hold, and, inferentfally, upon the
households of his hundreds of co
workers, may answer for rhetorical
purposes, but this is not appreciated by
the people of a city like Sacramento,
which has always prided itself on its
ability to weather far greater calami
ties than the destruction of a couple of
the many buildings at the railroad
shops. The effect of the circulation of
such a publication is, of course, disad
vantageous to the city, and, naturally,
where the article has not been laughed
at here, It has aroused a measure of
resentment.
The Bee to-night, referring to the
story in last Sunday's Examiner, says:
The article was altogether misleading,
as the facts are decidedly otherwise than
those the article sought to convey. The
truth is that by far the larger part of the
men who were temporarily made idle
wen put at work within a day or two
after the flre and have been kept at work
ever since. Those who have not been
able to return to work are In the minor
ity, and as many of these own their own
homes and not a few have bank accounts,
there is no likelihood that their Christ
mas will be very heavily curtailed.
In conversation to-day H. J. Small,
superintendent of motive power and
machinery, stated that 200 ut the 300
men temporarily thrown out of work
by the fire were now being employed in
the temporary shops erected pending
the completion of the new buildings,
which were under way.
The citizens of Sacramento, as well
as the men at the railroad shops, do
not consider the fact that 100 men out
of a daily force of 2400 are out of em
ployment â waltine" for the new shops to
be finished warrants the publication of
a story whose pictures, headlines and
general character are int nded to
make the public believe that Sacramen
to Is in the throes of a poverty so in
tense as to make necessary a postpone
ment of the holiday season.
ASKS THAT HIS CHILD'S
BODY BE EXHUMED
Bound Mountain Resident Suspects
His Daughter Did Not Die a
Natural Death.
REDDING, Nov. 29.â Mary Rhoades. the
16-year-old stepdaughter of George Man
ley, died recently at Round Mountain and
was buried on Friday. Yesterday Coro
ner Earnest received a letter from the
dead girl's father requesting that the
body be disinterred and the stomach be
subjected to analysis. The parent avows
that his daughter died under suspicious
circumstances. Coroner Earnest, Dr. F.
P. Mitchell and District Attorney Rose
left to-day for Round Mountain to carry
out the request of the father.
Rumors are in circulation and have
been published to the effect that the
young lady had .been badly treated by her
stepfather, having been cruelly beaten on
more than one occasion. What clew the
father has for suspecting that his daugh
ter died other than a natural death would
not be divulged by the authorities.
Supposedly Incendiary Blaze.
SUISUN, Nov. 29.â The residence of R.
V. Sllveria, in Fairfield, was destroyed
by fire at 3 o'clock this morning. The
cause of the fire is unknown, but it Is
thought to have been the work of fire
bugs.

San Luis Obispo County's Supervisors
Refuse to Declare His Office
Vacant or Offer a
Beward.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN LUIS OBISPO. Nov. 29.â A1l day
experts have been figuring on the
amount of the defalcation of missing
Tax Collector S. M. Findley. F. C.
Cherry was appointed by the Board of
Supervisors to do the work. So far It
is impossible to arrive at the exact
amount of the deficiency, but it is gen
erally figured that it will reach about
$45,000.
The Board of Supervisors' refusal to
declare the office vacant has caused the
Fidelity and Deposit Company of Mary
land, which holds Findley's bond, to
determine to take charge of the office.
The Supervisors left the office in charge
of Miss Nellie Nesbitt and Miss Maud
Scott, who were Findley's ieputies.
They, with the expert, are to remain in
charge until the first of the year, when
H. H. Carpenter, Tax Collector-elect,
will take office. Carpenter does not de
sire to take the office at this time, in
its present condition, should the place
be tendered him by appointment.
So far no clew has been discovered as
to the whereabouts of the missing offi
cial. Some think that he is en route to
China, having departed from San Fran
cisco on the first steamship to sail after
his arrival there.
A few weeks before the election Find
ley was very free with coin in betting.
He wagered most of his money on
Charles A. Barlow, fusion candidate
for Congress in the Sixth District. Bar
low being defeated, he of course lost.
He also was lavish in spending: money
for candidates who were his friends,
and the supposition is that he was
short several thousand dollars before
he conceived the idea of fleeing from
the county.
The Board of Supervisors has refused
to offer a reward for his apprehension,
claiming that the surety company
which held Findley's bond should exert
itself to capture the fugitive, inde
pendent of the efforts of the county.
The surety company is displeased, as
it requested that a reward be offered.
MARGARET CODY ON
TRIAL FOR BLACKMAIL
Alleged Attempt to Extort Money
From Miss Helen and George
Gould.
ALBANY, N*. V., Nov. 29.â Mrs. Mar
garet Cody's trial on the indictment for
blackmail was begun in the Albany Coun
ty Court before Judge Gregory to-day. It
is alleged in the indictment that Mrs.
Cody wrote letters to Miss Helen and
George â  Gould on February 11 and Mareb
9, 1898, respectively, risking them to call
on her and promising them that she would
give them what was alleged to be valu
able information to enable them to effect
a compromise or discontinuance of the ac
tion pending against the heirs of the. late
Jay Gould to establish the dower rights of
Mrs. Angell. on the ground that she was
the first wife of Jay Gould.
Miss Helen Gould and her aunt. Miss
Elizabeth Palm, were present at the trial
to-day. After the jury had been impan
eled George Gould was placed on the
gtand as the first witness. He identified
two letters from Mrs. Cody, which were
received by him in February, IS9B, and
September, 189 S. These letters suggested
that Mrs. Cody had means for discontinu
ing the case of Mrs. Angell against the
Gould heirs. He had never had a personal
interview with Mrs. Cody.
Mrs. Angell, who alleged that she wag
married to Jay Gould when he was a
young surveyor, and who afterward con
fessed that she had no basis for her state
ment, has been summoned as a witness on
behalf of Mrs. Cody. Mrs. Cody has been
confined in the Albany Jail since her ar
rest In New York City in May last just as
she was about to sail for Europe, whither
she was going to represent American
claimants in the Shepard estate in Eng
land.

CASE COMING
Large Party Left Do
ver Yesterday.
DUNNING WILL BE ON HAND
PROSECUTORS CONFIDENT OF A
CONVICTION.
Attorney General White Claims to
Have a Case That Will With
stand All Legal As
saults.
WILMINGTON, Del.. Nov. 29.â The
Delaware witnesses for the Botkin
case left Wilmington at 7:36 o'clock
this evening over the Pennsylvania
Railroad for San Francisco. They go
over the Pennsylvania route to New
Orleans and thence over the Sunset
route. The party was composed of At
torney General Robert C- â¢ White, who
tyill assist in the prosecution; State
Detective Bernard J. McVey, who as
sisted in working up the case; ex-Con
grress:nan J.>hn B. Pennington, the
venerable father of the murdered wo
men; Joshua D. Deane, the husband of
one of the murdered women; Dr. Lem
uel A. H. ' PJshop and Dr. Pressley
Downes- who i ttended the patients; ex-
Postmaster Thomas (Jooden, who was
Postmaster and placed the box of candy
in the Penninyton mail box; Delia
Deane, a -daughter of one of the mur
dered women, who ate some of the
candy; Miss Josephine Bateman and
Mii-s Ethel Clark who also ate of the
:.t.d candy but escaped; Miss Ethel
Millihgton who also ate some .of the
candy; Harry -^ennington, who carried
the box home and gave it to his aunt,
Mrs Donning, and Dr. Theodore R.
Wolfe, the State chemist, who made the
analysis of the poisoned candy.
The party occupied a special Pull
man car and will be looked after by
Attorney Generai White and Detective
McVey.
John P. Dunning, the husband of the
woman to whom the poisoned candy
was sent, is in Chicago, and will go tv
San Francisco from there.
Dr. Downes at first refused to go, be
cause the authorities were not willing
to compensate him sufficiently for leav
ing his practice for such a long period,
but he was finally prevailed upon to go
and consented so late that he scarcely
had time to pack his clothing.
Walter Morris, the cashier of the
Farmers' Bank, who was summoned
as a witness, could not go because he
has been summoned to appear as a wit
ness in the case of United States Sena
tor J-Uchard R. Kenney, charged with
aiding 1 and abetting in misapplying the
funds of th._- First National Bank of
Dover and the Government insisted
upon him remaining here.
Attorney General White in discussing
the case said:
"We will be successful, no doubt, if
we eet a good Jury and. a good court;
we v. ill secure a convictiou of Mrs. Bot
kin. fur we have the case against her.
We have a complete case and unless
outside circumstances over which we
have no control occur or unless outside
influence is exerted we surely ought to
convict.
"I do not know very much of the
California law under which she is be
ing tried, but I understand there is
punishment for the crime if it is com
mitted wholly or in part in that State,
and under such conditions we should
surely secure a conviction."
"Do you think the California authori
ties would hang Mrs. Botkin if she were
convicted?" Mr. white was asked by
The ("all correspondent.
"I don't know whether they will hang
her, but they surely should convict her.
A fair field and no favor is all we ask
there."

CHANDLER'S VOICE
AGAINST ANNEXATION
Believes the Philippines Should Be Under a Protectorate,
With a Government of Their Own
Creation.
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, Nov. 29.
Regarding the Philippines Senator Chandler said to-day that he
was not willing to commit himself at this time to the permanent
annexation of the islands. He believed, however, that they should
never be returned to the bloody rule of Spain. "I believe," said he,
"that they should be liberated like Cuba and aided to form, if pos
sible, a free, self-governing state, protected by the United States in
consideration of the adoption of a commercial treaty by which there
should be free trade between the Islands and the United States.
"We will not become imperialists by controlling the destinies of
the Philippines. With our seventy millions of people we can man
age to take care of nine million Orientals without danger, giving
them self-government or possibly transferring them to England for
a due consideration."

J the lecture chair of Stanford University
for the last semester of IS9S is that of
Rabbi Voorsanger is held as one of the
Rabbi Voorsangeris held as one of the
most learned and liberal men of the
West. For some years he has held the
position of professor of Semitic lan
guages in the University of California
and it is now partly through the cour
tesy of that university that he comes
as a lecturer to Stanford. This, how
ever, will be far from his first appear
ance before a Stanford audience. He
has spoken many times in the univer
sity chapel and has been proved one
of the most popular men to occupy that
position. He comes now as a regular
lecturer, delivering a six months' course
of one hour a week. The subject of the
course will be "'The Jewish Framework
of Christianity." "
At present in the Bible studies Dr.
Thoburn is delivering a two-hour course
on "The Life and Teachings of Christ."
It will be to broaden this work that the
rabbi comes. Every effort will be made
to join the two subjects and make one
three-hour course of both, as they fall
naturally into the same category. In
speaking of the work Dr. Thoburn said:
"We cannot study Christianity prop
erly unless we study the setting to
Christianity, and it will be this early
Christian environment that the rabbi
will attempt to give. Christ came from
and lived among the Jews, and in the
early centuries the entire setting and
surroundings of Christianity â the forms
of worship, the people of the time, # the
friends of Christ, the very background
j of the Christian era â all were Jewish.
j And it will be this vast field the learned
I rabbi will explore. It promises to be
one of the most interesting courses in
j the university, not only to Bible stu
dents but to every lover of history."
"But is this not liable to become a
study of the Jewish chufch?" was
asked. "And may not these lectures on
Christian framework be liable to bor
der very closely on Jewish creed?"
Dr. Thoburn's answer was strongly in
! the negative:
"These lectures will be entirely his
torical and will have nothing to do with
| the Jewish presentation of Christianity.
Rabbi Voorsanger is very learned upon
this subject and the course, while valu
able, will be valuable only as history."
Dr. Voorsanger is expected to have a
synopsis of his course ready within a
| few weeks. .

VIENNA, Nov. 29.-In the Reichsrath
to-day the Premier and Minister of the
Interior, Count Thun Hohensteln, reply-
Ing to an interpellation on the subject of
the expulsions of Austrians from Prussia,
said that while there was undeniable se
verity in the action of the Prussian au
thorities, it could not be described as a
flagrant violation of the principles of in
ternational law.
Nevertheless, he added, the Foreign Of

steps taken by the Prussian officials and
the assurances of the Berlin Cabinet war
ranted the hope that greater considera
tion will be shown to Austrians.

THE SA:S FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1898.
ARGUING THE
ALCOHOL CASE
Supreme Court Hears
an Appeal.
CLAIM OF MANUFACTURERS
ASK THAT THEY BE GRANTED A
REBATE,
Declared That They Should Not Be
Forced to Pay Tax for Alcohol
Used in the Making
of Hats.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.â Argument
was begun in the United States Su
preme Court to-day in the case of R.
Dunlap & Co. vs. the United States, in
volving the claim of this firm to a re
bate on alcohol used in the manufacture
of hats as allowed by the sixty-first
section of the Gorman-Wilson tariff
law. The case comes to the Supreme
Court on appeal from the Court of
Claims, which refused the petition for
a rebate on the ground that the grant
failed when the Secretary of the Treas
ury did not prescribe the regulations
which were made necessary by the
law.
The argument was begun for Dunlap
by George A. Wing, who contended that
the objection raised by the court below
was without force and did not relieve
the Government from the obligation to
pay the rebate. He argued that the pro
fessed object of the Wilson-Gorman law
was the reduction of taxation, whereas
the tax on spirits had been increased
from 90 cents to 51 10, contrary to the
spirit of the law as a whole. This
tax amounted to 95 per cent and was
made so enormous, as all know, because
of the use of spirits as a beverage, and
while this might be legitimate the same
reason could not be supposed to have
been good in the use of alcohol in the
arts and. industries which it was our
policy to foster and not discourage.
Evidently, he argued, the intention of
Congress was to relieve our manufac
turers from the tax in order to place
them on an equal footing with foreign
manufacturers who had free alcohol.
Moreover a drawback is allowed on im
ported alcohol used in the manufacture
of articles to be exported. Hence the
present practice was a discrimination
against American alcohol. He held
that the fact that the requirements of
treasury regulations should be coupled
with the allowance was more in the
nature of a direction to the Secretary
than a condition under which the re
bate should be allowed.
Concluding, Mr. Wing declined to con
cede the position of the Government
would be equivalent to leaving the en
forcement of any legislative enactment
to the discretion of the executive, which
he claimed was an encroachment dan
gerous to the best interests of the citi
zen and one not to be encouraged for a
moment by the judiciary.
Special Attorney Binney contended
on behalf of the Government that the
people of this country were sufficiently
protected against encroachment by the
executive officials and that there was
no danger from that score. He argued
the determination of the question
turned on the one point as to whether
the grant to the manufacturer was con
ditional, holding that it was made upon
the condition that the rebate should
be made only after the Secretary had
made his regulations. The Secretary
had failed to make these regulations
because without the power to execute
the law it would be unavailing, hence
the untenable character of the claims
of the appellants. The Secretary had
not put himself above the law, but he
had found himself unable to protect the
United States in the execution of the
statute. He contended the court could
not take cognizance of the manufact
urers' contention, as it could not per
form executive acts or sustain the
rights of persons dependent upon ex
ecutive action which had not been per
formed. The exercise of a discretion
by the executive was no usurpation, but
an act for the protection of the interests
of the Government and this was not the
only instance in which such discretion
had been exercised.
Indeed, the action of Congress in re
pealing the law made it manifest that
Congress had partially at least antici
pated such course as the treasury had
pursued.
The time for the presentation of the
case was continued for two hours and
Attorney General Giiggs and Hon. J.
H. Choate will be heard to-morrow, the
Attorney General for the Government
and Mr. Choate for the appellants.
There is much interest manifested In
the case, especially among the manu
facturers of proprietary medicines. It
is said to involve an aggregate of
$4,000,000. -
BERING ISSUE NOT DECIDED.
Ang-10-Ainerican Commission Far
From a Final Settlement.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 29. â The Anglo-
American Commission had expected td
resume the consideration of the reci
procity discussion to-day, but as the
Bering Sea question had not been dis
posed of the consideration of that branch
of work was continued. While consid
erable progress had been made a linal
adjournment upon the sealing question
is not yet assured. Besides the present
valuation of the Canadian sealing fleet.
It is said the relinqufshment of the

PROVE TROUBLESOME.
French Papers Pretend to Believe
That the Monroe Doctrine
Has Been Repudi
ated.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Nov. 29.â The secretaries of
the two peace commissions. Messrs.
Moore and Ojeda, began their joint task
of formulating the articles of the peace
treaty at 3 o'clock this afternoon, as>
directed by the respective commis
sions at yesterday's conference. This
work will be easy and rapid as to the
relinquishments and cessions referred
to in the protocol, the terms of which
document Will be transferred bodily to
the treaty.
The secretaries, moreover, will em
body in tentative articles for discussion
on Wednesday the subjects of the relig
ious freedom of the Caroline Islands, a
naval station for the United States in
the same group, cable landing rights at
other points within Spain's jurisdiction,
the release of the insurrectionist pris
oners and the revival of the treaties
broken by the w.ar.
Thus the commercial and general
treaty of 1795 will be revived to be re
cast later; the treaty of 1834 for the set
tlement of certain claims will be re
vived; the treaty of 1877 providing for
extradition will be revived; the trade
mark treaty of ISB2 will be revived and
the supplemental extradition treaty of
1887 will be revived, in addition to. sev
eral modus vivendi agreements.
On all the points outside of the pro
tocol there will be friendly negotiation
only, Spain having the right to name
the prices she wants for her territory
and to reject or accept the American
offers. The Spaniards no less than the
Americans now are anxious to conclude
the business which brought them here.
As the result of the work of Mr.
Moore and Senor Ojeda the draft of the
articles embodying the protocol agree
ments was completed this evening. It
will be presented to the two commis
sions in the morning at their separate
sessions, when it will receive final con
sideration. There will be little delay
on these articles.
Mr. Moore will also submit to-mor
row to the United States Commissioners
the subjects to be presented to the
Spaniards for negotiation. These, for
convenience and greater dispatch, are
being drafted into the form of article.".
The release of the Insurgent prisoners
held by Spain will go into the protocol
agreements, it having been already
agreed that Spain Is to release them
upon the United States undertaking to
secure the release of the Spanish pris
oners in the hands of Aguinaldo. This
question is so intimately related to the
peace treaty that it has been removed
from the subjects that are matters of
negotiation, and has been embodied in
the articles containing the protocol
agreements.

FILIPINOS A CAUSE
OF APPREHENSION
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.â The Gov
ernment has been officially advised of
the successful termination of the Paris
peace negotiations with Spain. A cable
gram to this effect, which had been re
ceived from Chairman Day, was read at
to-day's Cabinet meeting by the Secre
tary of State.
By the terms of the treaty, which
will be signed during the present week,
Spain surrenders to the United States
her sovereignty in the Philippine
Islands and Guam Island, one of the
Ladrone group. In lieu of all claims
to indemnity the United States will
pay Spain the sum of $20,000,000 in gold
or its equivalent.
Before returning to the United States
our Paris Commissioners will secure
from the Spanish representatives, if
possible, a proposition for the sale to
the' United States of an island in the
Caroline group, some distance east and
south of Luzon, for a cable station.
Should Spain, however, decline to sell
the island for a reasonable sum, the
matter will be dropped, for the present,
at least. The possible cession of this
island is not involved in the pending
treaty, and no pressure will be brought,
to bear to induce Spain to paj-t with it.
The apprehension which manifested
itself some time ago o-ver the attitude
of Agulnaldo and the Philippine insur
gents has not entirely disappeared,
though the administration believes
they will accept the situation without
a conflict with the United States. The
matter was discussed at the meeting
to-day and some of the views expressed
indicated a possibility that the insur
gents may yet have to be dealt with.
PRESS OF PARIS IS
MUCH DISGRUNTLED
PARIS, Nov. 29.â Commenting on the
peace negotiations the Petit Bleu says:
"The Monroe doctrine is now out of
date. The American republic, conquer
ing and colonizing, no longer has the
right to close to Europe the new con
tinent, since she herself has stepped
out of It."
The Temps says: "The transatlantic
democracy has become an imperialist,
and a republic founded on federalism
and autonomy has become a conquer
ing one. From an international point
of view this means a repudiation of the
Monroe doctrine and the entrance of
America into the conflicts and intrigues
of the great powers, and her harshness
to Spain is the cause of much anxiety
as to her relations with other powers."
CONFIDENT THE TREATY
WILL BE RATIHED
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â The Washing
tern correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Prompt ratification of the
American-Spanish treaty of peace is
expected by the administration. From
conversations the President has had
with the Senators who have called
upon him during the last few days he
expects that there will be little oppo
sition to the treaty, though he has
found a diversity of opinion as to the
future government and disposition of
the Philippines.
SHARKEY WILL FIGHT
CORBETT FOR NOTHING
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â Yesterday, in a published interview, Cor
bett was quoted as saying he was willing to fight Sharkey again for
nothing, provided he was allowed his training expenses. To-day Torn
O'Rourke, Sharkey's manager, issued the following card:
"Corbett has stated he will fight Sharkey for nothing if allowed
training expenses. Sharkey accepts, providing the proceeds go to the
poor as a Christmas gift, the press to form a committee who will
distribute the money. Let Corbett name the time, which must not be
later than two weeks henoe."
The plan of Sharkey's manager, O'Rourke, to have the sailor and
Corbett meet for charity is looked upon as one designed to again
create public interest in another contest, so that the pugilists can
reap a two-fold harvest. It is pointed out that "Jim" and "Tom"
passed the lie at the whitewashing investigation; that Corbett asked
far another chance at Sharkey, and that O'Rourke, Sharkey's man
ager, promised it. And now, as approaching a fitting climax, comes
the proposition to fight for charity, notwithstanding Ctrrbett and
Sharkey are considered pugilistically dead as far as this city is con
cerned.
In the rounds among sportingmen yesterday the general impres
sion was found to be that Corbett and Sharkey would eventually
fight in San Francisco. Many believe that there is already a perfect
understanding between them.

NEW YORK, Nov. George Dixon,

FLOW OF NATURAL GAS.
Discovery Made on the Lambrecht
Ranch Near Suisun.
BUISUN, Nov. 29.â The fact that natural
gas exists about seven miles east of Sui
sun has again been proved. The latest
discovery has been made on the ranch of
Ludwlg Lambrecht. near the Allen place,
on which the first indications of j-as were
found some years ago. Mr. Lambrecht
has bored a well about forty feet deep
Over the top a tank was placed and pipes
attached thereto led to his home. The ex

SPECIAL ELECTION FOR
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
Judge Gaddis of Woodland Rules That
It May Be Held Under the
Constitution.
WOODLAND, Nov. 29.â A new and in
teresting point of law was passed upon by
Judge Gaddis in the Superior Court to
| day. At the recent election there was a
tie for the vote for Justice of the Peace
in Washington Township. The Board of
I Supervisors ordered a special election. J.
N. Gill, one of the candidates voted for,
made application for a writ of prohibi
tion commanding the Board of Super
visors to refrain from proceeding further
in reference to the calling of a special
election. The petition was argued this
The contention was that the section of
the code under which the election was
called was unconstitutional, and that a
Justice of the Peace could be elected only
at a general election. The section referred
to provides for the election at a special
election of all officers, in case of no choice,
except a Governor and Lieutenant Gov
ernor but it is a well-known fact that a
Superior Judge cannot be elected except
at a general election and can be appointed
only to till a vacancy.
The attorney for the petitioner cited
numerous authorities upon this point.
The acting District Attorney submitted
the case without argument. The court
took the matter under advisement for a
few hours, finally denying the petition for
the writ. The petitioner will appeal.
The court admits the contention of the
petitioner that Justices of the Peace are
as much a part of the judicial branch of
the Government as are Judges of the Su
perior Court, but holds that the special
election would be part of the general elec
tion of November 8, IS9S.

SHERMAN WON HIS
WAY WITH BRIBES.
Boasted He Bought a State Officer
for Forty=Two Thousand
Dollars.
James G. Fair Fought the Great Manipulator
With His Own Weapons -Indignant
Councilmen.
The Call exposed Moses H. Sherman
yesterday morning as the professed cor
rupter of the City Council of Los An
geles. In the tremendous scheme which
Sherman evolved out of his brain to
ruin the Pacific Bank and to win for
himself the fortune he now enjoys
there were many elements of dishon
esty that had not yet been exploited.
Sherman received the full indorse
ment of the McDonalds to c-perate as
he pleased. He was at liberty to float
excessive bond issues, to foist upon the
Pacific Bank and the People's Home
Savings Bank worthless securities and
to corrupt and bribe public officials
wherever and whenever he found the
necessity to do bo. The Call 1 showed
yesterday morning that Sherman re
ceived $60,000 upon his uncorroborated
statement that he had bribed; two of
the City Councils of Los. Angele.s to
grant him certain valuable franchises
that acted as a death-dealing competi
tion to the cable road of the southern
city.
The Call will show this morning how
thiÃ conscienceless manipulator at
tempted to secure $42,000 by asserting
that he had bribed officers at Sacra
mento to assist him in securing the
adoption of a law necessary to his great
scheme in floating the bonds of the Les
Angeles Electric Railroad. . i .â¢ â 
It should not be taken for granted
that the City Council of. Los Angeles or
the Legislature of this State was/bribed
by Moses H. Sherman.: The pnly fact
that can be proved is that Sherman de
clared that he had bribed these bodies
and that he received money for the al
leged bribery. Most of the men -\yho
were members of the City, Council of '
Los Angeles in 1890 and 1891 -occupied
positions of trust and honor. in- their
community. Most <>f. them have been
Interviewed by representatives of -The
Call and all vehemently deny that they .
ever received a cent; for granting the
franchises which Sherman "received..
Some of these valuable. franchises were
granted to B. CX . Carr, Sherman's
brother-in-law, who s6ught the official,
favor of the authorities of Los Angeles
through A. -W.. Barrett* . : who is now
adjutant general of this State. At that
time Carr was manager... of the People's
Home Savings Bank and had the right
to declare that he had "behind him in
earnest support the McDonalds and all :
their tremendous resources: ; . ... . '.-
The franchises for the electric road
of Los Angeles were granted- at a tiTne
when the citizens of that city, were do-
Ing their utmost to advance their local '
interests. Speculators and â¢â property
owners were eager, to encourage any.
enterprise that would be. a "benefit, to the
town. The cable road in. which the San.
Francisco Savings Union of this, city,
the Bank of California,. Jam.es G. Fair,
and the Pacific Rolling Mills wefe in
timately Interested was the only road
that opposed the grant , of the.se fran-.
chis^s. There is nothln- to.- Indicate,
that the owners of this road attempted
at that time to prevent by corruption
the introduction of an electric railroad
system. â â¢ .....'â¢â¢
The fact remains, however, that Sher
man received $60,000 upon his unsup
ported assertion thai he had bribed .two
City Councils of Los Angeles to obtain'
franchises for this road. The" greatest
indignation has been excited by the
publication of this fact. The . men
whose personal honor Moses H. Sher
man outraged to fill his private purse
emphatically deny that they â¢ were
bribed. ...
The Call has given the facts as they
exist, and this morning it shows how
Moses H. Sherman attempted to s-ecure
another fortune by â  asserting his abil
ity to bribe the Legislature .of this
State in 1891. In order that his. out
rageous claim should be thoroughly
understood, it will be necessary to pub
lish something more of the unwritten
history of the Los Angeles Electric
Railroad. When Sherman conceived his
preat plot to build an electric railroad
in Los Angeles he did not confine his
corrupt activity to thÂ« Pacific Bank or
to the Pacific Rolling Mills. As The
Call showed yesterday morning Sher
man bribed from the agents at the
cable railroad of Los Angeles the se
crets of that institution. He discovered
what the Pacific Rolling Mills had al
ready done and what it intended to do.
He Induced the managers and directing
spirits of the corporation to champion
his cause and persuaded them to under
take the construction of the road under
conditions most favorable to himself.
It will be remembered that ohe-third of
the construction price was to be. paid
in cash, which Sherman determined
â¢hould be supplied by the Pacific Bank,
the Pacific Rolling Mills agreed to the
terms, and Sherman's persuasion in
luced the McDonalds to enter the.
eheme. Sherman, however, had not
jet finished his preliminary labors.
The Pacific Rolling Mills could not at

that time supply electrical appliances
on its own responsibility. The Edison
Electrical Company, of which A. R.
Reese was at that ttme the manager,
was worked into the scheme to supply
the appliances necessary to the opera
tion of the road. Sherman thus far,
therefore, had secured without the ex
penditure of a dollar the co-operation
and unqualified support of the Pacific
Bank, the Edison Electrical Company
and the Pacific Rolling Mills. The Edi
son Company was to supply the elec
trical appliances. The Pacific Rolling
Mills was to supply the power house,
rolling stock and rails, and the Pacific
Bank was to give from its vaults the
money to satisfy in part, at least, the
claims >of the construction company.
Sherman, however, had â¢ evolved a
deeper scheme than the simple c6n
struction. of a great railroad, He
wanted to float a great bcm&'issue, and
in addition to what he ordinarily would
have earned from the construction of
the road, he sought to win a profit from,
.the. Inflated issue of bonds. ;.. . '-V r
â  : Under, the .laws of this State, how-
I ever, no transportation company that
had adopted electricity as a ; motive
power could issue bonds. It was neces
sary for .Moses H. Sherman to secure
the adoption of a law by the Legisla
ture of the State legalizing electric mo
tive power on the same plane as other
transportation companies using other
motive power. While Sherman was
scheming some means to secure such
legislative action the explosion of offi
cial anger occurred in the Pacific Roll
ing Mills. James G. Fair, who was the
â principal owner of stock in the. Pacific
Rolling â¢ Mills and one of the leading
backers of the cable railroad of Los
Angeles, was informed that, some of
â thedfficers of the Pacific Rolling Mills
and the McDonald. family were fn col
lusion to injure his cable property to
.a .very serioius extent. There had been
; sorne friction between the Edison Elec
trical Company" and the Pacific Rolling
Mills. .Contracts which the Edison
Electrical Company had received in
"connection with the Los Angeles Elec
tric Railroad having been fulfilled, the
Electrk? ' Railroad ...Company gave' its
patronage td a competing corporation.
It was understood at -the time that an
officer of -the Pacific Rolling Mills was
the cause of- this change '.Qf patronage",
and the managers of i-he Edison Elec
trical Company : were:- in. consequence
greatly " Angered. ". They, detailed â  to
James G. Fair some of the inside facts
in" connection with the construction, of
the Los."- Angeles" Electric â  Railroad.
They showed that a.52,400/000 borid issue
had been made upon- an expenditure of â¢
$675,000. â¢ -.â¢â¢â¢.. . - r '
â¢â¢ James G. Fair immediately, became
frightened at this most peculiar "finan
cial- transaction. He instituted an. .in
vestigation at- once. and he. came seri
ously to the conclusion that Moses H.
Sherman .'" and the .McDonald family
â were very shrewdly attempting to "in
jure . him. Before his inquiry had "been
concluded he forced several important
changes in the-. management of the Pa
cific Rolling Mills. ' One- manager re
ialgned '"and another was put in his
place. The .investigation revealed the
very interesting fact' that -several. prom
inent employes of the. Pacific Rolling
Mills; and a number of men highin the
service -of the Southern Pacific Com
pany held large blocks of. stock Qf the
Los-Angeles Electric Railroad. Why
this ' stock was held by these people
.James G. Fair could not understand.
Those men over whom he had authority
he forced out of his service and insisted
that the Los Angeles Electric Railroad
Company reduce its enormous bond is
sue-to a figure that would more reason
ably represent- the relation between the
expenditure required by the construction
of the road and the face value of the
bonds. Even then James G. Fair saw
that he. was in an anomalous position.
The Pacific Roiling Mills had pFacti
cally constructed the cable railroad of
Los Angeles and at that time held
nearly $200,000' of the bonds of this cor
poration. The California Bank,' the Sun
Francisco Savings Union and several
prominent capitalists and financiers of
this city and Oakland held, many of
these bonds, .but Fair considered that
it was impossible, for him to evade the
issue* and he determined to stand by
the contract of t&e Pacific Rolling Mills
to. construct the Los Angeles Electric
â¢Railroad.
Fair determined, however, not to be
caught again in what he considered to
be a trap. He sent one of his mast
trusted agents, A. J. Binney, to Los
Angeles to oversee the work of con
struction and to watch carefully that
no thefts were committed. At that time
the San Francisco and San Mateo Elec
tric Railroad was in process of con
struction under Behrend Joost and
others and the manipulators of that
concern were fearful that Fair's in
dorsement of the Los Angeles Electric
Railroad would militate against their
interests. The Pacific Rolling Mills
was building. the San Francisco and
San Mateo Electric Railroad, and J. W.
Hartsell of that corporation" was afraid
that in the construction of the Los' A
ngeles road his interests might be jeop
ardized. Every effort .was made -by
him, therefore, to prevent Fair con
tinuing his support of the Los Angeles
Electric Railroad. These efforts were
in vain, as Sherman had placed a" man
much shrewder than himself in a posi
tion where he could not retire. The
road was constructed, but James G.
Fair took every means in his power to
see that the work was honestly done
and - the money legitimately expended.
It should be understood that in the
business ethics of James G. Fair the
bribery of State and municipal offl

| cials was considered to be a legitimate
I expenditure.
The time had new come when Moses
I H. Sherman had to take another great
| step in his scheme. A formidable foot
! ing had been secured in Los Angeles
: and the cable railroad system had been
; paralleled by the franchises granted to
j the electric railroad system. A serious I
i competition had been introduced and
! the war between the two roads was on.
i At that time, however, the laws of this ;
j State did not permit an electric railroad
! system to issue bonds. Sherman deter
! mined as part of his scheme to put forth
I an enormous bond issue. This was neces-
I sary as a matter of course, as the Pa- j
j cific Rolling Mills had agreed to accept
two-thirds of its payment in bonds.
Friends of the manipulator wanted
something out of the venture and it
was necessary to legalize under the
laws of the State bonds of an electric
railroad.
It was also imperative that the
schemer should have the privilege of
passing over the very tracks of his j
competitor. The cable railroad of Los
Angeles had, as The Call had already
indicated, literally cobwebbed Los An- j
geles. Sherman wanted to use some of
the streets occupied by the cable com
pany, and in 1891 he went to Sacra
mento to secure the adoption of a law
permitting the use of certain streets
held by one railroad company for the
benefit of another. This was known as '
the "five-block law," which in outline !
meant that for a space of five blocks
one railroad could. use the tracks of an- !
other railroad. Sherman, as a matter |
of o'urse, wished to secure the legaliza- |
tion of electricity as a motive power in |
transportation.
It should not be forgotten that some
of the most prominent bankers and I
capitalists of this city, such as I. W. i
Hellman, Lovell White and Thomas !
Brown, were opposed to. Sherman. The
cable railroad of Los Angeles, under I
the management of J. F. Crank, was
doing everything in its power to kill I
the electric railroad. It was natural to
suppose, therefore, that Sherman's ef
forts-at Sacramento would be vigor
ously opposed. There was nothing to
indicate, that any actual opposition
was made by these people, in 1891 in
Sacramento, but Sherman insisted that
he had met with the uncompromising j
antagonism of these people, and upon
this .declaration unsupported by any
corroborative fact he demanded the
payment of $42,000, which he asserted I
he had paid to secure the adoption of
the electric railroad and five-block bills
by the Legislature of this State. Dur
ing these times, and they were very ex
citing ones in the history of the con
spiracy, Sherman very frequently came
to this city and registered at the Lick
House under the name of Smith, â¢ He
did this to avoid unnecessary and pos
sibly troublesome inquiry, and to pro
tect himself from the service of any
legal document that mlgtet have bee.n
sued In behalf of the cable railroad.
With his customary good fortuiie he
secured the adoption of Ihe laws he |
sought at Sacramento, and then he re
turned to this city to demand from
every, individual and every corporation
that was interested a pro rata share of
the bribe money which he claimed he
Had paid at Sacramento to secure the
adoption of the law. There- is probably
no exaggeration to Bay that every
street railway .corporation in the State,
with the exception of the Market Street
Railway Company, was interested
favorably in the adoption of the laws
that Sherman demanded. The Market
Street Company, as the people of this
city will readily understand, would
have been opposed if it had taken any
active interest in the affair to the adop
tion of such a law. I. W. Hellman,
Daniel Meyer and others were con
cerned in seeing that Sherman's bills
became laws. Every electrical corpora
tion, such as the Edison Electrical
Company, was as deeply interested in
the success of Sherman's plan as these
bankers. Sherman understood this
thoroughly, and he went from one cor
poration to another demanding that
they give up what he considered to be
their, share of the bribe money of $42,
000.- He went to the managers and di
rectors of the Edison Electrical Com
pany and insisted that they â¢contribute
$5000. Other corporations and capital
ists were approached for sums of
money. They all positively declined to
'submit to ..Sherman's practical black
mail, and the schemer had to seek else
where.
This, in outline, is the story of an
other of Moses H. Sherman's shameless
deals in this State. The Call will con
tinue its recital to-morrow morning,
and will show what else Moses H.
Sherman did in his corrupt progress to
win a fortune.
BARRETT SAYS
"NO COIN USED"
He Acted as an Agent, but
. . Indulged in No
Bribery.
Adjutant General Barrett, when seen
last night, said:
"While I was their agent in securing
the passage of such ordinances as were
desired, -I never received or used a cent
dishonestly. As far as the receiving of
or paying of any money to the Council
men of Los Angeles for dishonest pur
poses, I desire to say that such a
charge made against me by Sherman
is a lie from the whole cloth. My deal
ings were aboveboard and will bear
public inspection. In no way was I
ever connected with the bribery of any
Councilmen. nor did I even hear of any
such thing having been done."

m a n.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 29.â "Moses H.
Sherman never expended' sixty thou
sand dollars in bribing the members of
the Los Angeles City Council of 1890,
nor the members of Aldermanic body
who held office in IS9I. to secure the
passage of the ordinances which
granted franchises to various parties
for electric street railways, and which
franchises afterward beca. le the prop
erty of the Los Angeles Consolidated
Railway Company!"
This statement was made to-day by
Jacob Frankenfleld, who was President
of the City Council in IS9O. That was
the Council which passed the original
franchise secured by Sherman interests
in this city. Mr. Frankenfield is a re
tired capitalist. He was formerly
president of the-California Bank in this
cit- 1 ' and is highly respected. In dis
cuosing the matter of the franchises
further the gentleman said:
"The franchise you refer to was se
cured in the name of Mr. Carr, who was
at that time, I believe, president, or an
other official of the People's Home Sav
ings Bank. A. W. Barrett, now adju
tant general of the State, acted as the
agent of Carr, and appeared before the
Council in his interest. He made a
strong presentation and urged the
adoption of the ordinance. We investi
gated the matter and became convinced
that the application for the franchise
was made in good faith. We felt as
sured that Carr had ample capital be
hind him, and we voted unanimously
to award it to him. Henry T. Hazard
was Mayor of the city at the time. He
vetoed the franchise ordinance, and we
passed it over his veto. I never heard
or knew of one dollar being used to in
fluence a vote in favor of the franchise.
At the time it was granted the people
of the town were only too glad to give
anything of that character that tended
to secure the investment of capital
here."
One of the members of the Council of
1890 was A. C. Shafer, 'who represented
the Fifth Ward. He was very indig
nant to-day when questioned as to
the use of money to secure the adoption
of the Carr franchise. Mr. Shafer said:
"It is simply preposterous for any
one to suppose or think that money
was used to bribe the Councilmen to
vote for those franchises. We were
only too glad to have the opportunity
to do so. When the application was
first put in by Carr, A. W. Barrett ap
peared as his agent and general rep
resentative. At that time the members
of the Council were not informed as to
whether the franchise was being asked
for by parties who were in good faith.
Barrett, upon learning of this, asked
that some one be sent to San Francisco
to investigate. He said that he would
present parties who would give assur
ances that if the franchise was grant- \
ed there was capital on hand to build
the road. I was selected by the Council j
to make an investigation. At my own 'â 
expense I proceeded to San Francisco !
and remained there one week. While !
there I was for the first time presented i
to M. 11. Sherman. I met the McDon- |
aids, Mr. ("arr and several other par
ties whose names I d<s not now recall.
They assured me that all the capital
was secured that was needed, and that
if the franchise was granted work un- i
der its terms would commence immedi- j
s.tely. I became convinced that what j
these people told me was true, re
turned to Los Angeles and so reported j
to my confreres in the Council. The j
ordinance granting the franchise -was
then passed by a unanimous vote. The i
only opposition to it in this entire com- i
munity was from the cable road people, j
It did not cost any money to get every !
vote in the Council for this ordinance,
and I never before heard it intimated
that any money was spent for this pur
pose."
Henry T. Hazard, who was Mayor of
the city, and who vetoed the ordinance i
granting the franchise, was seen, and <
in explanation of his veto said: "I re- I
fused to sign it for the reason that I j
did not think the people of the cily had
had time to consider the value of the
franchise the Council was giving. Then, j
too, it paralleled the franchise of the
Cable Railway Company, and I did not I
think that It was just to the stockhold- |
ers in that corporation, who had in- '
vested their money, to give another
company the right to build a line that !
would divide the patronage. I vetoed
the ordinance, but no one ever at
tempted to bribe me or to unduly in
fluence me to sign it. It would have
been a sorry day for the misguided in- j
dividual who would have attempted it." j
F. M. Nickel!, D. McGarry. Daniel
Innes, Samuel Rees. Theodore Summer- i
land and W. H. Bonsall. members of j
th^ Council of 1891, which body passed
a number of ordinances granting fran
chiftefl on side streets to the Sherman '
Interests, were seen. All of these gen
tlemen Indignantly denied that any j
money consideration was paid to them ;
to secure favorable action on the ordi
nances in question.
Tames Brown represented the Seventh
Ward in the Council of 1890. He voted
for the Carr franchise. He was de
feated for re-election in December of j
1890, and when Sherman's road began |
operation he became a motorman. He |
has since continued In this service, and
is to this day engaged in that humble
capacity. He insists that he got his
position on his merits, and that the Job
was not mentioned at the time he voted
for the franchise.
MISSION HIGH SCHOOL.
Question of Its Acceptance Submit-
ted to a Board of Arbitration.
The Building and Finance Committees
of the Board of Education met !n the
Mission High School yesterday afternoon
to consider the acceptance of the new
institution of learning. There were pres
ent Directors Barrington, Waller, Galla
gher. Hammond and Burns. Architect
Charles Havens, Superintendent James
Fennel and Contractor Logan.
After a thorough investigation the build-
Ing was found to be complete except as
to the ventilating and heating apparatus,
which was let on an independent contract.
It was agreed that Contractor Logan had
complied with the specifications, but a
difference .of opinion existed between him
and Director Burns as to the amount of
debits and credits. Burns claiming that
the sum of $500 was due the city and Lo
gan a like amount to himself. After
some discussion it was decided to FUbmit
the matter to a board of arbitration, one
to be chosen by the committees, one by
Logan and the two so selected to choose a
third.
It is the intention of the directors to
request Samuel H. Kent, president of the
Builders' Exchange, to serve, but It is
not yet known whom Logan will select.
Saved His Clarionets.
Conductor Hlnrlchs of the Baldwin
orchestra counted himself fortunate in
Bavins from the hotel fire the remnants
of his valuable violin, but his joy does
not equal that of Caesar Caspar!, who
for years has played first clarionet in the
same place of amusement, besides exe
cuting occasional solos at the park and
in society concerts. Mr. Caspar!, on the
night of the fire, left two valuable in
struments in their leather covered case
under the stage of the Baldwin. They
werf* imported from Paris, and it is said
their equals cannot be found on the coast.
In searching the ruins of the theater the
case of instruments was recovered and,
to the delight of Signor Caspar!, his mu
sical treasures were uninjured.

HARRY VANDALL A
COLLECTOR, MISSING
BELIEVED TO BE NOW IN PORT
LAND.
His Debts Were Many and His
Friends Say He Fled From
Creditors.
Harry Vandall. collector for the Cali
fornia Powder Works, is missing. He
is believed to be in Portland or some other
of the northern cities.
Vandall attended to his duties a week
ago last Saturday forenoon as usual and
started out again in the afternoon on a
collection trip. He did not return that
night, and his employers and friends have
seen nothing' of him since. Sunday a
friend of the young man purchased two
tickets for Portland, and upon this fact is
based the belief that he started north that
night. However, the friend is again in the
city
If'the charges made against him are
true Vandall is certainly the black sheep
of an excellent family. His two brothers
hold positions of trust and are highly
esteemed by business associates and social
acquaintances, while his widowed mother
is a member of one of the best-known
families in town.
Vandall has been in the employ of the
California Powder Company for six years,
and that officials of the company will take
no steps to bring him back indicates that
nis dereliction is not regarded by them as
serious. The statement is made by
friends that the only reason for the dis
appearance of Vandall is that he had be
come somewhat involved in debt and, har
assed by creditors, decided to find sump
new field temporarily. They confidently
expect him to return.
NOT MUCH OF A LOSS.
Captain Bermingham Has No Special
Regret for Destruction of Build
ings at the Powder Works.
In speaking of the" accident by which
several buildings at the California Pow
der Works were destroyed yesterday,
Captain Bermingham, president of the
company, said:
"Our loss is not as great as might at
first be supposed. We had a contract
with the Government for the manufac
ture of smokeless powder and a large
amount was ready for Immediate ship
ment. Fortunately for us a provision in
our contract provides for just such a
contingency as this, so that we will lose
nothing by a failure to provide the sup
ply within a stipulated time.
"Aside from our fosses there Is one
feature of which I am glad. These
burned buildings were erected in a hurry
as we secured contracts and they were
put up with little regard to order. Now
we can replace them properly and situ
ate them at a safe, distance one from
the other. The loss on the buildings
may foot up $30f>0 and that on the gun
cotton about $500. The machinery may
cost us anywhere from $3000 to $6000 and
over to replace. We shall begin work
immediately on rebuilding, so our 100
men will not be idle more than a month."

CLAIMS THE WEALTH
MADE IN CALIFORNIA
Missing Heir to the Estate Left by
Michael Franz Berberich Turns
Up in Pittsburg.
FITTSBtTRG, Pa., Nov. 29.â Franz Jo
seph Berberich, a notion dealer at 36
Lowry street, Allegheny, called at police
headquarters to-day and said he was the
missing heir of Michael Franz Berberich,
who died in San Francisco November 10,
leaving nearly 120,000 to his son Joseph.
The latter said he had been christened
Joseph Franz Berberich, but had changed
it to Franz Joseph. Mrs. Mary H. Ber
berich, his mother and the widow of the
deceased Californian, accompanied him
She had her marriage certificate and the
record of the birth of Joseph, who had
been baptized in St. Philomena's Church,
this city. The Californian left Pittsburg
thirty years ago to try his luck in the
coast gold fields. His family heard- from
him for a time, but his letters ceased.
Several years ago Mrs. Berberich heard
her husband was living in San Francisco.
When he died several weeks ago she re
ceived a telegram announcing his death.
Mayor Geyer advised Berberich to con
sult a lawyer, which hÂ£ did. His counsel
will write* to San Francisco for particu
lars regarding the dead man's estate. All
that is known about it here Is a letter
received by Mayor Geyer asking him to
look up the heir.

San Jose's Mayor and Council Will

Officials.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 29.â Mayor Martin and
the Common Council of this city will wait
upon the Southern Pacific Railroad offi

railroad shops be located here. This ac
tion was decided upon at a meeting yes
terday. It is currently reported that
on the completion of the Santa Margarita
gap and the coast road next summer rail
road shops will be built somewhere be
tween San Francisco and Salinas. The
railroad company owns about thirty acres
on the westt-rn suburbs of the city that
are suitable for the purpose, and San
Joseans will try to induce the officials to
bring the shops here. Nothing will be
left undone in this direction, as the build
ing of the shops and the employment of
several hundred men would give an im
petus to Greater San Jose.

BONES OF A MISSING
MAN DISCOVERED
Mystery Veiling the Death of B. F.
Roberts of Shasta County
Cleared.
REDDING, Nov. 29.â The skeleton of
B. F. Roberts, who lost his way and per
ished in a snowstorm over a year and a
half ago, was found on Saturday by two
bear hunters in a canyon leading to Pit
River, some thirty miles from Redding.
Two years ago next March Roberts left
his home at Roberts Station, east of this
city, to institute a lodge of Patriots of
America at Montgomery Creek, about
thirty miles distant. He was on horse
back, and at Benjamin Jenkins' place, in
stead of taking the toll road, he turned off
upon what is known as the Backbone
road That was the last time he was seen
alive. A heavy snowstorm set in, night
came on and he lost his way and perished.
For weeks after his disappearance the
country was searched by as many as thir
ty men at a time. The horse was found,
dead, but not a trace of the rider.
Roberts was a pensioner, In receipt of J.,i
per quarter. The day before he left on
his mission to Montgomery Creek he re
ceived his quarterly check from the Sub-
Treasurer's office in San Francisco, and
from that day to this the widow, with a
large family and sorely in need of the
money, was unable to have the check
cashed because she could not prove her
husband dead.
Roberts was an educated man, widely
known in this county and of splendid rep
utation. He had taught school here and
elsewhere and had served a term as depu
ty postmaster of Redding under the late
J. N. Major. The later years of his life
were devoted to farming.
With proof of her husband's death the
widow will now not only receive the mon
ey long overdue, but be speedily granted a
pension dating back to the time of her
husband's disappearance.

CONVICTS ROB ONE

San Quentin Prisoner Attacked ty
Three Others Who Thought He
Carried Opium.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Nov. 29.-
Driven to desperation by their cravings
for opium and seemingly reckless of the
severe punishment to be visited upon
them, in case of detection, three convict*
fell upon one of their number whom they
suspected of being in possession of a
quantity of the drug
him to the ground and nfled his POpketa
of their contents whrle several of the
guards stood around the corner or a
building not over thirty feet away me
boldnese of the deed has astounded the
officers, for it Is the tirst instance in
which footpads have been known to roi
low their calling inside the prison walls
For three months owing to the vigilance
exercised by Warden Hale and Captain
Birlem opium has been so scarce inside
the walls that its use has been confined
to a few members of what is known to
the inmates of the "inner circle.'
Sunday several guards were attract
ed by the rounds of a struggle around
the corner of a building, and rushing to
the spot, found Frank Calmel, who is
serving a life sentence for a murder
committed In Kern County lying prone
upon the ground and nearly senseless.
Ah soon as he was able to talk he ex
plained that he had been set upon from
behind by three convicts. One choked
him another held his arms while the
third rifled his pockets. Ihen he was
stunned by a blow on the head. As the
malefactors mlnglod with the other pris
oners after the assault and their facea
were not seen by Calniei he could give
no clue to their identity and the officials
have not been able to lay. hands upon
them. t'almel refuses to admit that any
opium was' obtained by his assailants.

Complications in Connection With the
the Affairs of the Moore Min
ing Company.

rior Court of Calaveras County yesterday
was commenced the suits of William A.

cases are being tried as one before Judge
Gottschalk.
Captain NevMs, who is part owner of

termined, the property sold and the sum
realized divided among the owners.
After the usual motions to-day Captain

the figure at from $1W to 1300 a month.
Among the Joint defendants with Nevills

WHERE DID THE IRON GO?
RISDON IRON WORKS BLAMES
THE ARCHITECT.
Expert Reid Holds That the Depot
Roof, Improperly Riveted,
Is Now Going to
Pieces.
The Senate inquiry to ascertain
â¢what amount the State was defrauded
In the construction of the ferry building
was resumed yesterday morning at the
office of the Harbor Commissioners. Sen
ators Dickinson, Prisk and 3oyce at
tended the session. Commissioners Col
non and Harvey and Howard Holmes,
chief engineer of the board, paid close
attention to the inquiry.
E. B. Young, attorney representing
Contractor Cronan, applied to Expert
James W. Reid for lurther information
concerning the data on' which the report
of the expert was ba;sed. Mr. Reid re
plied readily and intelligently to the line
of questions, and was not obliged to re
cede in any degree from the calculations
or conclusions of his report.- â¢ After a
number of preliminary questions
about roofing had been answered- Mr.
Young put a leading question which elic
ited a reply to the effect that. the roof of
the ferry building was not a, good jobâ
that a sufficient number of rivets was
not put in to hold the galvanized iron
and the roof was now coming to pieces
at the skylights. â¢â¢ ... ;
Senator Dickinson called .for â¢ specifica
tions in regard to riveting, ami when
they were produced it .was made clear
that the rivets were not to be more thaa
three inches apart. 'â â 'â  â  L ' . ,
Mr Young asked if the expert had ever
known of such, close riveting of corru
gated iron. Mr. Reid without a trace of
impatience suggested that the inquiry
was not pertinent. y" ' â¢ . .
Mr youngâ fall back on the speci
fications? ;. 'â¢â  'â  ' , " . -
Mr. Reidâ There is nothing else to fall
'captain \V.--'H. Taylor of the ' Risdon
Iron Works sat alongside of -Architect
Swain during the better part of the af
ternoon session. Mr Reid, the "Senators,
Commissioners" and spectators were the
quiet witnesses of a little controversy or
conflict of opinion between the represen
tative of the Risdon Works and the su
pervising, architect, Mr.. Swain. General
Dickinson did not interfere to , abridge
the right to free speech. . Expert Reid
said nothing as the little exchange of
views vividly verified', the .accuracy of
Tn xplanation of certain changes Cap
tain Taylor remarked that there was a
misfit in the construction of the building.
and that the superstructure did not fit the
ground plan. He. said. .he did not know
where the fault rested. ... ' â¢â '
When the subject- of . tower braces or
tie rods was reached Architect Swain in
dicated that -the .fault in respect, for
which the Staie.had to. pay $1449, should be
charged to": the Kisdon Iron Works. Then
Captain Taylor remarked, "I had intended
not to reopen this controversy, but since
you have ... aed it.. Mr. Swain, I am
here >to repel any. -assault on the Risdon
Iron Works.-"-' â¢.'â¢ " â¢ 'â¢ " ; -'-
Then more, light was -thrown on the
changes. [1 Was brought .out â¢ . that the
original plans' provided for inside braces
or rods. As the. work progressed the
nlans were ich=ahged ta'place the. rods out
side, but the further progress of con
struction. â¢â¢' 'made it necessary to again
change and -put the braces inside.
Senator = Dickinson suggested that some
one in charge must have authorized the
changes. ./â¢â¢' â¢ ." â¢..â¢' ''â¢'â 'â  ' -
Captain Taylor made an extended ex
planation.' In. substance he said:
"There must have been fifty shop draw
ings of this work: They were sent here,
and the supervising architect approved
all of them.-. He claims now that he
hardly looked them, and as a matter of
form signed them."- Turning to the su
pervising architect. Captain Taylor said:
"Mr. Swain, you have brought, all of this
on yourself." â¢ . * â¢'".".
Mr. Swain replied that he would have
something to Say himself. Thereupon he
read some letters addressed to the Risdon
Iron Works- calling attention . to the re
quirements ..of the specifications and
plans. ' :" â¢ â¢ 'â ';â â â  '.- VSR
Captain Taylor insisted that the letters
were written after the mischief was done.
Senator Dickinson maintained .that as the
amount claimed by the Risdon. people had
been paid by the State, that the con
troversy was settled in so far iisthe iron
firm was concerned. â¢ â¢ : - : ..
The inquiry â¢ then branched off .to- roof
rods of some kind. Captain Taylor said
there was an increase of the cost by rea
son of putting them : in. The architect
authorized their omission, but Chief En
gineer Holmes" dissented. The Board of
Harbor Commissioners sustained the en
gineer. Chief Engineer Holmes remarked
in explanation that he demonstrated to
the board by ' a practical : test that the
rods were necessary. , :'. .-='.
Four windows .then engage^ the atten
tion of the committee. The Risdon Iron
Works insisted that they were not obliged
to put them it. It'was contended that the
drawings did not demand the windows
and the specifications' afforded no light
on the subject. - : - â¢" "
Mr. Swain said he decided to allow on
a compromise basis the sum of $600 for
the windows. Mr. Reid adhered to the
contention, of the expert report .that the
Fpecifications required the Risdon people
to furnish the 'windows. ;
Captain Tay.lor, who was obviously anx
ious to get away to attend to other af
fairs, was â somewhat reluctant to .leave
without a ' clean bill of " health for- the
Risdon works, so he framed a g.eneral
question to Mr. Reid.' He asked if in the
â judgment of Mr. Rei-d .the Risdon Iron
Works had not performed its contract
in good faith to the State.' -. :'
Mr. Reid was" hot quite carried away
by the blandishments of- the captain,, so
he qualified an affirmative answer with a
suggestion that : some of the '.iron was
pretty rough. â¢â¢ â¢ . . "
Captain Taylor folded his " papers, re
marking that the iron, though rough, was
strong, and that 200,000 pounds of iron in
excess of contract requirement had been
supplied. â¢â¢â..".'â .
Mr. Swain, directed to Mr. Reid certain
inquiries regarding window screens in the
Claus Bpreckels building and in the new
residence of. Claus Spreckels. The pur
pose ...i ; to- sJiow that Mr. Reid in his
capacity as architect was- mistaken as to
the value of. certain metal contrivances
to shield windows. â¢
ili Swain will go on the witness stand
to-day to explain why changes were made
in the original plans of the ferry build
ing and to Indicate by whom the changes
were authorized. .â¢ â¢. ,'-

CLOSE FINISH OF AN OCEAN RUN.
The barkentine W. H. Dimond and the bark Martha Davis sailed from Honolulu for this port within half an
hour of each other, sailed over 2000 miles to gether, and yet never sighted each other until they reached the Golden
Gate. The Dimond arrived at 2 p. m. yesterday, and half an hour later the Davis dropped anchor alongside of her
off Lombard street wharf.

DID NOT SPEAK EACH OTHER
DURING THE VOYAGE.
Harry S. Scott Out for Chief Wharf
inger â Indorsed by the Lum
ber Merchants and Iro
quois Club
The bark Martha Davis and barkentlne
TV. H. Dimond have been having a quiet
little race all to themselves. They left
here within a few days of each other for
Honolulu, and while the Davis is an easy
winner on the round trip, the Dimond
wins the race from Honolulu here by an
I hour. The Dimond sailed from Hawaii at
I 1:30 p. m. on the 10th lnst. arid arrived
! here at 2 p. m. yesterday, while the Davis
! sailed half an hour earlier and arrived
half an hour later. Both vessels sailed in
and came to an anchor within a few hun
dred yards of each other. From the time
they parted company off Diamond Head
until they met again off the Golden Gate
neither vessel was sighted from the other,
and each captain thought the other was
in port.
The barkentine Irmgard, however, boat
both the Davis and Dimond. She left here
several days after them and sailed from
Honolulu three days after them and still
made port the first of the trio.
The arrival of the Martha Davis
brought joy to the hearts of the reinsur
ance gamblers. On the 25th inst., in lati
tude 37.10 north longitude 132 west, she
spoke the overdue British ship Scottish
Hills The latter vessel is now out 188
days from Hamburg for San Francisco,
and 10 per cent reinsurance was paid on
her yesterday morning. The first thing
Captain Blackmore of the British vessel
asked was "How is the war getting
along?" When Captain Frils of the Davis
signaled back "All over. Spain, whipped,"
| the Britisher at once replied "Glad to
' hear It."
Another vessel that got in yesterday
after a good run was the French bark
Jeanne d'Arc, 59 days from Newcastle,
N. S. W. She beats into port such fast
ones as the British ship Cardiganshire,
now out C 2, and the French bark Jules
! Verne, 69 days from Australia.
There should be some close finishes
i among the coasting steamers due to
morrow. No less than fifteen of them are
[due from various ports, so the Merchants'
| Exchange reporter will have a busy time.
' The EHhu Thomson, Charles Nelson and
! Washtenaw will be due from Puget
Sound, the Columbia from Portland, the
' Arcata and Empire from Coos Bay, the
Navarro and Weeott from Yaquina Bay,
the Ruth and Cleone from Tillamook, the
Aloha and. Point Arena from Point Arena,
the Chilkat from Eureka, the Orizaba
from San Pedro and the Gipsy from Santa
Cruz. As storm signals have been ordered
displayed along the Oregon and Washing
ton coasts, some of these vessels will have
a rough time of it.
One of the deckhands on the river
pteamer Alviso had a narrow escape from
drowning yesterday. The boat was back
ing away from the wharf, when he stum
bled and fell heavily against the rail.
Luckily, when he went over part of the
rail went with him and to it he clung like
grim death. Captain Pike of the State
tug Governor Irwin saw the accident and
threw the struggling man a rope. He was
soon hauled aboard the Irwln and in a
few minutes was back on the Alviso and
the Bteamer continued hf>r run to Alviso.
The fight for the position of Chief
Wharfinger, which will soon be made va
cant by the resignation of George W.
Root, has begun in earnest. Half a dozen
candidates are out for the place, but no
one has been more prominently mentioned
than Harry S. Scott, the present Assist
ant Chief Wharfinger. Yesterday the lum
ber merchants and ship-owners on the
front sent in a very strong petition ask
ing the Harbor Commissioners to appoint
him to the place, and a similar one was
presente-d from the Iroquois Club. He
was also indorsed by the Democratic
State Central Committee, and, among oth
ers, by Congressman James G. Maguire.
Mr. Scott has made a most efficient As
sistant Chief and is a general favorite on
the water front.
The O. and O. Company's steamer Cop
tic sailed for Hawaii, Japan and China
yesterday crowded with passengers and
freight. Many of those in the cabin are
bound for Honolulu, showing that the
travel to the Paradise of the Pacific is
growing rapidly. The barks Alden Bes
se and Roderick Dhu, which are to sail
in a few days for Hawaii, will have all
the passengers they can accommodate,
and a number of people who wanted to
take passage on thf-m i.aye been com
pelled to wait for other vessels.
The transport Zealandia arrived at Ma

of age. and left her husband and - ree
young children, taking her eldest girl with
her. Tomaselli left a wife and child be
hind him. ,_ _ .
The police in Pittsburg were notified of
the elopement, and a description of the
runaways was sent broadcast, a reward
of $25 being offered for information as to
their whereabouts. Piazza learned that
they had come to this city, ani imme

tained that they were living at Green and
Dupont streets, and he called t..ere ana

with him and take her daughter with her,
but her father wanted Tomaselli punished,
and went to police headquarters.
He was unable to obtain a warrant, out

JABBED WITH A PITCHFORK.
A Special Officer Attacked Savagely
by Three Scavengers.
Special Officer Trade, who Is employed
by the Crematory Company, was the com
plaining witness against three scavengers
yesterday in Judge Mogan's court, two on
charges of battery and one for assault to
murder.
Saturday afternoon Trade found the
three men dumping garbage at Lone
Mountain and placed them under arrest.
One of them. Louis Staganoro, seized a
pitchfork and jabbed Trade on the knee
with the prongs and then broke It over
his back. The other two pelted him with
rocks and he was forced to retire van
quished. He swore to warrants for their
arrest Monday morning.
Staganoro was charged with assault to
murder and Caesar and Luigi Devincenzi
Â£itn t>atterv. Trade thought that Caesar
had surrendered himself Monday to save
his brother and was under the impression
it was a case of personation, but Luigl
was arrested yesterday and he saw that
he was mistaken. In the battery cases a
iurv trial has been demanded, and the
felony charge has been continued for a
week.
DEADLY DYNAMITE
IN A MAIL POUCH
ALARMING DISCOVERY IN THE
SAN FRANCISCO POSTOFFICE.
Believed to Have Been Placed There
by the Lunatic Dwyer, Who
Annoyed the Turkish
Consul.
An employe of the main postofflce found
! last Sunday in the waste pouch a stick of
explosive gelatine large cough to blow the
Postofflce building and the Custom House
i into splinters. It was labeled "Repaumo
! Gelatine; 60 per cent Nitro Glycerine.
i Made by Repaumo Chemical Co., In WII
j mington, Del."
The alarming discovery was at once
| communicated to Superintendent Cox,
j who reported the matter to Inspectors
; Munro and Erwin. They found thaf the
; explosive was of the same kind and make
as the sticks of dynamite sent through the
mails some time ago to Mr. Hall, the Con
sul for Turkey in this city, by an insane
young man named Dwyer, whose resi
dence is supposed to be in Butte, Mont.
i Dwyer left Montana before the officers
| could catch him, and he is roaming about
in some unknown quarter of the country.
The inspectors do not know whether the
package was mailed with a wrapper and
i an address or not. If wrapped and address
ed the wrapper came off in transit and was
lost. For this reason it is impossible to
learn whether the explosive was mailed
from this city or some other place. In the
waste riuch are dumped waste paper and
newspap* vs that cannot be forwarded, and
the stick, of dynamite was caV-lessly
dumped into the pouch by some postofflce
employe, though why it should have es
caped the vigilance of the postal clerk*
handling the mall Is strange.
Mr. Erwin has taken charge of the dead
ly explosive and will dump ft in the bay or
explode it In some isolated spot in the
country. He has no doubt that the stick
was mailed by Dwyer.
D. W. Hitchcock Returns.
General Passenger Agent D. \V. Hitch
cock of the Union Pacific has returned
from a two weeks' visit to Omaha. He
says the company's freight office will be
conducted Independently of the passenger
office. General Freight Agent Schu
macher, who recently resigned, has been
replaced by W. H. Davenport of Los An
geles, who will assume the duties of the
office in the future.
To Spot the Fraud.
TV. M. Rice, United States Commissioner
of Immigration at Victoria, left on the
steamer Coptic yesterday as the secret
agent of the Government to investigate
the manner in which Japanese and Chi
nese coolie laborers are imported into Ha-
and Japan. Mr. Rice will also visit Hong
kong and Yokohama for the same pur
pose.

NOT IN HASTE
TO GIVE OUT
THE OFFICES
Governor-Elect Gage
Resists Pressure.
PUBLIC BUSINESS FIRST
APPOINTMENTS CAN WAIT ON
LEGISLATIVE WORK.
Subject of Patronage May Not Be
Considered Until Early in the
Month of February
Next.
Governor-elect Henry T. Gage did not
do any more work yesterday than the
law required. He greeted personal friends
and supporters, listened to suggestions
and took good care not to promise spe
cial favors. During the past few days
he has resisted great pressure to induce
him to signify a choice among numer
ous applicants for certain places.
Touching the subject of appointments
to office he said last night:
"1 intend to take time to consider the
merits of applicants in order to get men
capable of rendering the best service to
the State. Before I make any appoint
ments other than those immediately con
nected with the orpanizatlon of the ex
ecutive office I shall go to Los Angeles
and put my law office affairs in shape
so I can reside in Sacramento. Some
time will be required to consider my in
augural address and then 1 want to rest
for a few days before the inauguration.
My idea therefore is that the appoint
ments can be deferred until a month or
so after the Legislature convenes. Time
must be given to consideration of leg
islative matters and other public affairs.
In my judgment the public business
should be attended to first."
The Governor-elect did not make choice
of a dwelling house during his recent visit
to Sacramento, and it is not settled now
whether he will board or keep house dur
ing the next session of the Legislature.
He will probably visit Sacramento again
before going there to take office. On the
next visit ne may be accompanied by
his private secretary, W. I. Foley.
To-day Governor-elect Gage will meet
several State Senators at their request
to talk over certain topics having refer
ence to reports of public institutions.
THE FIGHT STILL ON.
More Women Arrested in Bacon Place
by Secretary Kane.
Secretary Kane, for the prosecution,
and Attorneys Ach and Rothschild, for
the defense, spent the greater portion of
last night in Bacon place, the former en
gaged in arresting the inmates of the
alley, and the latter seeing that those ar
rested were released on bonds.
Twenty-two warrants were issued by
Judge Conlan yesterday, and all of these
were served during the night. Twenty
were for women who were charged with
keeping houses of ill-fame, and two for
the men owning the property, who were
charged with letting tenements for im
moral purposes. All were immediately re
leased on bail, the bonds of the men be
ing $H)00, and those of the women $300â
reduced from $1000. The warrants, with
the exception of one, contained the names
the women had given at the station when
arrested previously on the charge of va
grancy. The exception was a Jane Doe
warrant for a woman named Lillie, whose
real name could not be learned by Secre
tary Kane.
Attorneys Ach and Rothschild were on
hand when Kane and Officers Coleman
and Clark, detailed to serve the war
rants, arrived at the alley, and the
women were surrendered to the police
without any trouble.
The five women arrested Monday night
for keeping houses of ill-fame in Bacon
place, and the two men arrested for let
ting tenements for immoral purposes, ap
peared in Judge Conlan's court yesterday
and the cases were continued till this
morning, when Attorney Ach will ask for
a change of venue in all the cases.
Festival of Holidays.
The Westminster Presbyterian Church,
corner of Page and Webster streets, will

daysâ Thursday and Friday, December 1
and 2 â afternoons and evenings. There
will be a fine entertainment each evening
given by some of the best talent of this
city. The festival will be patriotic in
character, as all the American holidays
wil be represented, and a novel and strik

Aid the Project.
PETTY RIVALRY MUST CEASE
NEED OF OFFICIAL SOCIAL LIFE
AT SACRAMENTO.
Important Meeting of Republican
Members of the San Francisco
Delegation to the Next
Assembly.
One of the last acts of Governor
Budd's administration will have to do
with a matter in which every person in
the State, men and women alike, are
more or less interested. It is the pro
viding of an executive mansion at Sac
ramento for the use of the executive
head of the State government.
During the past quarter of a century
the question of providing a suitable
place of residence for the Governor and
his family has been agitated, and al
ways with the same result: Failure of
definite action.
The people of Sacramento believe,
and the people resident in other parts
of the State expect, that the Governor
should not only be the head of the of
ficial life at the Capital, but he should
also be the head of the social life as
well. It is proper and fitting that the
chief executive of a gTeat and wealthy
State should entertain in a manner be
fitting his position, and that his per
sonal establishment should be in all
respects up to the standard of social
excellence demanded by his position in
the official life of the State.
Conditions as they now exist have
forced a majority of the Governors of
this State to leave Sacramento out of
the question as a place of residence, or,
if accepted at all, to accept with the
best grace possible the makeshift ac
commodations of the private boarding
house. Official social life has thus be
come a thing unknown in the capital
city, and because of it the dignity of
each administration has suffered.
The administration just coming to a
close has been a striking example of
this, and none have been better aware
of the fact than Governor Budd. He,
like many of his predecessors in office,
has felt a delicacy about advocating
the building or purchase of an execu
tive mansion during his term of office,
for fear that he might lay himself liable
to the unjust criticisms of ungenerous
persons. He, like others, did not care
to have it said of him that his advocacy
of such an innovation was due to selfish
motives.
Notwithstanding this the need of a
proper and permanent place for the
personal establishment of successive
Governors is as great as is the neces
sity of the place that has been pro
vided for their official household. Meas
ures have been set on foot from time to
time to supply this need, but in almost
every instance the object has been de
feated by petty jealousies arising from
the selection of sites or the rivalries of
selfish real estate agents and local
boom promoters.
Governor Budd has intimated that he
believes it to be his duty to make this
subject a part of his final message to
the Legislature. Such a recommenda
tion would no doubt meet with the ap
proval of the lawmaking body, and if
no difficulties were encountered ample
provision would probably be made for
the practical realization of the scheme.
It therefore seems to rest with the resi
dents of Sacramento to assist the pro
ject by concerted and unanimous ac
tion, for if the same obstacles are en
countered In the future as have been
in the past it is quite possible that of
ficial social life in the capital city will
be a thing unknown for many years to
come.
Ten Republican members of the San
Francisco delegation to the Assembly
held a meeting last night and tran
sacted such preliminary business as is
necessary to the proper representation
of this city in the lower house of
the Legislature. Those present were:
Charles F. Keneally, L,. A. Devoto, Wil
liam H. Cobb, A. H. Merrill, W. H.
Rickard, Henry W. Miller, Henry C.
Dibble, L. A. Henry, Fred Lundquist
and M. H. Barry. The only absent
member was Eugene Sullivan.
It was proposed to select the chair
man of the San Francisco delegation,
and William H. Cobb and Henry C.
Dibble were placed in nomination for
the position. A vote was taken and re
sulted in Cobb receiving seven votes
and Dibble three. No announcement
was made and it was decided to post
pone final action on the proposition un
til Monday evening, when another
meeting will be held, and it is hoped
the full delegation will be present.
REGULARS FOR MANILA.
War Department Will Believe Volun
teer Troops Now in the Phil
ippines.
The War Department has decided to re
place the volunteer troops who are now
in the Philippines with regular soldiers.
An order has been issued to mobilize the
Second, Third, Fourth, Seventh, Thir
teenth, Sixteenth and Twentieth Infantry
at Omaha for the purpose of equipping
them for service in the tropics. These
regiments have all been in the Cuban
campaign, and are now scattered through
out the country. They are recruited to
their full strength, and number nearly
9000 men.
The volunteer regiments which sailed
on the first two expeditionsâ First Cali
fornia, First Oregon, First Colorado and
Thirteenth Minnesotaâ will be relieved as
soon as the regulars reach Manila, which
will be about the middle of February. The
advance guard will reach here before Jan
uary 1. The steamer Scandia, now on the
way to this port from Manila, will
probably carry the first detachment. The
regiments will be sent here one at a time
and placed on transports without delay.
As soon as Congress passes the bill for
the enlargement of the artny an additional
force of 10,000 regulars will be ordered to
the Philippines. Army officers estimate
that it will take at least 20,000 men to
maintain order in our new possessions.
The soldiers assigned to the islands will
be relieved every three years.
The only regular regiments at present in
the Philippines are the Eighteenth and
Twenty-third Infantry and part of the
Third Artillery and Fourth Cavalry. It is
understood that it has been determined by
the War Department to keep General Otis
in command of the Philippines indefi
nitely.
Cuba and the Spanish War.
To-morrow evening at 8 o'clock W. H.
Jordan will deliver an illustrated lecture
before the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation at the association auditorium, Ma
son and Ellis streets, on "Cuba and the
Spanish War." Some very fine views will
be thrown upon the canvas. Cards or ad
mission complimentary may be secured at
the association building or of any mem
ber of the institution.

It is now conceded by eminent sci-
entists that the most important organs
of the whole body are the kidneys.
They filter your blood and work away
night and day. whether you sleep or are
awake. , Â
People are apt to believe that kidney
disease is a rather rare disease, but re-
cent discoveries have proven that it is
a most common trouble.
And the proof of this is that most dis-
eases, perhaps 85 per cent, are caused
in the beginning by disorders of the
kidneys.
BECAUSE they fail to filter your
blood. â , ,
You cannot be sick if your blood is
pureâ free from kidney p-ioon and dis-
ease-breeding germs.
The treatment of some diseases may
be delayed without danger, not so with
kidney disease. .
When your kidneys are not doing
their work it will be manifested by pain
or dull ache in the back, rheumatic
pains sciatica, sediment in the urine,
scanty supply scalding irritation in
passing it. obliged to go often during
the day and to get up duriner the night,
uric acid, sleeplessness, nervousness,
irritability. sallow, unhealthy com-
plexion, puffy or dark circles under the
eyes, loss of energy and ambition.
ARTHUR TEACHOUT
AS A HIGH ROLLER
HOW HE AND A COMPANION
HAD A GOOD TIME.
He Was Arrested for Petty Larceny,
tut Stoutly maintains That He
Is Not Guilty.
Arthur Teachout. a boy 14 years of age,
was accused in Judge Low's court yester
day of petty larceny in stealing $S oO from
the till in the drug store of Mrs. Laura
T Harris. 1247 A Kentucky street. Sunday
afternoon while her messenger boy, lllle
Hardney. was called out for a few
minutes.
With his ill-gotten wealth Arthur de
termined to have a good time, and Willie
and he started out Sunday night for that
purpose. They first visited the Chutes,
then the Alcazar, and finished up by going
to Morosco's as they did not care for the
Alcazar performance. Arthur kept an
Itemized account of their expenditures,
which is interesting. It includes 50 cents
to a conductor, cigars 10 cents, icecream
sodas 60 cents, French mixed candy $2,
blind man 50 cents, Alcazar $1, candy 10
cents, Morosco's $1, lemon drops 20 cents,
dinners $1 50, ham sandwiches 20 cents,
tamales 20 cents, carfares 30 cents, Edi
son's 30 cents, Willie Hardney 70 cents
came home midnight with $3.
Mrs Harris testified that Arthur had
stolen $20 from her on a previous occa
sion, but Arthur denied stealing anything
from her and said he got the money from
a druggist on Howard street, near Erie,
where he was employed. He thought the
druggist's name was McKenna. The only
druggist in that neighborhood is Charles
Anderson, and on being asked by an
officer who was sent by the Judge, he
said he did not know Arthur. The Judge
will make further inquiries and will de
cide the case this morning.
HER. BOILERS LEAKING.
This Was the Reason Why the Mary
T. Oarratt Was Stopped.
The steamer Mary T. Garratt of the
California Navigation Company was
stopped on her trip from Stockton to this
city yesterday by an order from the In
spectors of Steamships.
Captain O. P. Bolles, a member of the
Board of United States Inspectors of
local steamships, who is stopping at the
Lick, when seen last night relative to the
matter, said:
"The steamer was not stopped because
there was any immediate danger but be
cause it was learned that her boilers
were leaking slightly. A letter will be
sent by the inspectors to-day to her own
ers, requesting that the boilers be imme
diately put In perfect shape."
Escaped Leper Captured.
L.en Hin. a Chinese leper, escaped from
the Pesthouse yesterday morning, but
was captured again last night and sent
! back. A description of the escaped man
was furnished the police, and Officers
O'Brien and Cavanaugh, who were de
tailed in Chinatown, recognized him at
the corner of Sacramento and Dupont
streets and sent him to the California
I street station, from where Station Keep
1 er Young notified the Pesthousa

NO CHRISTMAS MONEY
FOR THE TEACHERS
BROKERS WILL NOT DISCOUNT
WARRANTS.
Short Funds and Big Supply Bill*
Shut Pedagogues Out From the
December Payroll.
The Board of Education will hold its
regular meeting to-night and the result of
it may mean scant Christmas money for
the teachers and possibly an extra month,
of holidays for the school children. The
regular end-of-the-year shortage is on,
and with $40,000 In unpaid merchandise
bills stacked up on the flies December
warrants are not going to have much of a
chance when they turn up at the Treas
urer's window, if December warrants be
issued at all. , . , .
The Directors also have a pian whicn
may develop at the meeting to-night, to
stop payment on warrants for November
which are payable on December o. This
as well as the December tip has gone out
to the brokers, and they nave tigntened,
their purse strings against all requests
for November pay.
Those good friends of the plodding ped
agogue the brokers, have already got the
tip and have hung out signs to the effect
that they are discounting no December
salary orders of the board, no matter
what" the inducement. They say that tha
plan of the Board of Education is to honor
the bills for supplies in preference to tha
claims of the teachers and that even then
there will be a number of local merchant*
who will have to pocket their losses.
As the tew goes the teachers have no
recourse for their unpaid salaries if tha
Board of Education has exceeded its one
twelfth of the levy, but it has always been
the custom of the succeeding board to pay
off the salary claims left by its predeces
sor as a matter of equity. There will be
probably no divergence from custom in
this respect, but with the funds available
at the present low ebb it may be a matter
of months before this is done.
The board will try to find a way out of
its dilemma when it meets this evening,
but the wise ones who make their money
on the pressing needs of warrant holder*
are not taking any chances on their find
ing it.
SOLDIER DOWD REMANDED.
Judge de Haven Refused to Take
Him Out of the Guardhouse.
United States District Judge de Haven,
yesterday remanded Thomas H. Dowd to
the custody of the military authorities.
Dowd enlisted in the California Heavy Ar
tillery last July while under age and with
out the consent of his parents. A few
weeks ago he remained absent from the
camp for three days and was court-mar
tialed and sentenced to thirty days im
prisonment in the guard house. While
serving his sentence his parents obtained
a writ of habeas corpus in the United
States District Court, but the boy was re
manded on the ground that the courts
could not interfere with the just punish
ment of a military offender.
Then young Dowd was court-martialed
for another offense, and the decision of
the court-martial has not yet been made.
Hence the court remanded the cuiprtt.
Lieutenant Sprague said yesterday that
the young soldier was a "tough" and very
unruly.

MIXED UP PAVEMENTS.
THE recommendation of the Fire Commissioners
that a strip of basalt block fourteen feet in
width be laid in certain streets so as to facilitate
dragging fire apparatus in rainy and foggy weather
will be apt to strike the local advocates of smooth
pavements with surprise. The Commissioners de
clare that when the bituminous streets are wet it is
almost impossible to make time with the engines,
water towers and hook and ladder trucks, and they
state that a strip of basalt through the center of each
block would give them the necessary foothold.
Heretofore smooth pavements have been a desid
eratum for which all classes have yearned. Outside
property-owners have not only refused to enter into
contracts for laying any other than bituminous rock
roadways, but they have appeared before the Board of
Supervisors and vigorously opposed all attempts to
force basalt blocks upon them. The Mayor and
Street Committee, amid the plaudits of the people,
have recently caused Market street from Second to
Sixth to be repaved with bitumen, and only the other
day a contract was let for continuing the same work
tc Van Ness avenue.
Now it seems that the Fire Department condemns
smooth streets and wants a strip oi stone laid
throughout the length of al! blocks heretofore paved
with bitumen. We do not know exactly how the
bituminous rock contractors and the property-owners
who advocate asphalt pavements are going to meet
this new situation, but that it must be met in some
way is certain. Whatever the Fire Department wants
it will ultimately get, for it is the protector of life and
property â the most important organization in the
city. If property upon bituminized streets is endan
gered by the absence of fourteen feet of stone
through the center, it is only a question of time when
a change will have to be made in that respect. Prop
erty-owners must have protection, whatever the cost.
From an artistic standpoint, however, the improve
ment suggested by the Fire Commissioners cannot be
said to commend itself to the understanding. At
present many of the accepted streets are conglomera
tions of cables, car tracks, cobbles, bitumen and ba
salt. To lay fourteen feet of stone through every
bituminous block in the city would convert the entire
town into a similar mosaic and send us thundering
down the ages as the most mixed up people on the
subject of pavements that ever existed.
CLEAR THE WRECK OWAY.
NATURALLY th^re is much speculation in re
gard to the future of the Baldwin site, but con
cerning the duty of the moment there is no
chance for two opinions. The wreck should be razed
tc the ground without delay. This thing of pottering
around for the purpose of saving a soaked mattress
and a blistered washstand is dangerous and disgrace
ful. The walls may fall at any time, and when they do
the second tragedy may be more fateful than the first
Surely there must be some method by which the
public can protect itself. If the owner won't or can't
attend to a work of such vital importance, the author
ities should brush him aside and for the sake of the
common welfare remove the menace. Certainly not
one scrap should be left above the level of the pave
ment.
Another matter to be regarded is the indecency of
leaving the dead so long in the tomb where their
bodies were hurled the night of the fire. As the
Baldwin stands now, blackened and tottering, it is a
huge sepulcher. The dead are entitled to respect. It
is not fitting that the threatening walls, which are a
peril to thousands daily, and which inclose more than
one corpse, should be permitted to stand, even if
while they last they serve the purpose of displaying
gaudy theatrical posters. Nothing can be done
toward saving the bodies until the walls have been
leveled. Meanwhile there the bodies must lie under
the debris, subject to the indignity of causeless neg
lect, their presence being in itself a source of palpable
corruption and a defiance of the sanitary rights of the
living.
Between now and March there will be ample time
for Harbor Commissioner Colnon to explain his con
nection with crooked contracts at the ferry. After
that date he will be out of office and lost to view. The
chance for him to redeem his reputation is while the
glare of publicity falls directly and pleasingly on him.
If the contractors for the Hall of Justice had been
fined according to the terms supposed to bind them,
they would have paid all the extra cost of that build
ing.
If Becker, the forger, were to be questioned as to
his belief in the existence of honor among thieves, he
would ruefully shake his head.
The Spanish pretender seems to think that if he
will only talk enough the throne will start out and
seek him.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1898.
COLONEL BURNS FOR SENATOR.
THE indications of the last few days are that
Colonel Dan Burns is in the fight for United
States Senator.
We omit discussion of the qualities for the place
which he lacks, for they are all included. When we
say this we do not deny that he has characteristics
which may become him as a man in his sphere of
life, but it is not a sphere in which great parties go
seeking for Senators. His disqualifications make up
so long a list, and some of them are of such a nature
that they cannot be referred to without regret and
pain. In his sphere and chosen place in affairs they
may not be noticeable, and therefore he may escape
the criticism which is invited and made necessary by
the proposed emergence upon a field where he suffers
when compared with the least qualified men who have
held the office he seeks.
His fondest friends must search in vain for any
proof that he is qualified and must shrink from an ex
posure of his disqualifications.
It is avowed that he is selected as a candidate by
the Southern Pacific Railroad and enters the field
with the backing of that corporation.
With it, then, we discuss its choice for Senator.
The people have just withdrawn the anti-rail
road fight. They have put the Republican party ir
pow.Â»r in a high time, when it needs its best train* A
men in all offices that concern California's interest in
national affairs. Why does the railroad at such a
time, when the conditions affecting it here are not
merely the truce that lies under the white flag, but
imply peace between it and the people, impose upon
tht State such a candidacy for the high place that was
the capital prize of the campaign?
Colonel Burns is no stranger to California. The
State tried him in official life, and the office of Secre
tary of State, while he held it, was an open bung out
cf which ran to waste thousands of dollars of the peo
ple's money. The waste was a felonyâ we do not
charge that he was guilty, but he was the man on
guard when it happened, and when summoned by
the law to answer he evaded the opportunity to vin
dicate his honor and prove his innocence, and pleaded
the statute of limitations! It is the unwritten law that
when a man is under such charges, that affect his
honor and honesty so far as to outlaw him from trusts
like that he is charged with betraying, and he dodges
through the statute of limitations, he must finish his
life under suspicion of guilt and the charge that his
plea was a confession.
Why does the railroad put him in the painful posi
tion of bringing all this to the light again, and why
does it seem to so lightly estimate the ending o. public
rancor toward it. as to pass all others by and set him
up as a mark of its own lack of judgment and a tar
get for comments that it should spare a friend, if he
hold that relation to it?
The success of such a scheme would put a future
burden on the Republican party that would gall the
withers of every candidate, from Governor to Con
stable, which it may hereafter present to the people.
A LAKE COUNTY RAILROAD.
IN a communication to The Call a correspondent
from Lake County directs attention to the oppor
tunity afforded for the profitable investment of
capital in the construction of a railroad which would
open up the county and enable the people there to
make a full development of the rich and va-ied re
sources it contains.
The subject is pertinent to the times and the re
viving spirit of enterprise. The long depression is
over and we are about to enter upon a new epoch of
railroad construction. In no part of the Union ought
this epoch to be marked by a greater increase in
railway mileage than in California. Certainly no
other State at this time offers such advantages for
safe investments in new railways, for in no other
are there such rich and wide areas of territory devoid
of railway facilities.
Our railway mileage in proportion to the area of
the State is small when compared with that of most
American communities, and of that area nearly the
whole is of a nature that would soon attract settlers
and become populous and rich if ample transportation
facilities were provided. Among such sections of the
State none is more notable in its resources and pos
sibilities than Lake County. It is renowned for ro
mantic scenery, health-giving waters, balmy climate,
fertile soil, and the wide variety of the products of
farms, orchards and vineyards.
By reason of the lack of railway communication
with the outer world the county seems remote. In
reality it is one of the cluster of counties that are neir
enough to the metropolis to be accounted almost as
suburban in these days of rapid transit. A railway
would bring it into such close connection with the
city that its lakes and streams would soon be among
the popular holiday resorts of pleasure-seekers, and
that fact alone would make a large passenger traffic
for the road.
While the mountains around the county are high
and rugged, competent engineers are said to be well
assured from personal survey that there is no in
superable obstruction to modern railway work. The
length -of road required would be short. Our cor
respondent outlines a route by which Lakeport
could be connected with the North Pacific Rail
road, requiring the construction of only twenty-five
miles of road, and on at least half of that the construc
tion would be easy.
The subject is well worth the consideration of cap
italists. California is behind her sister States in the
matter of railways. It is time for her to make known
the opportunities that are afforded within her limits
for profitable enterprises in that direction.
TOO MUCH SECTIONALISM.
A CONFERENCE, attended by five State Sen
ators and twelve Assemblymen, representing
the seven southern counties of the State, held
ai Los Angeles on Monday to formulate plans of ac
tion during the legislative season, is reported to have
adopted resolutions in favor of a State appropriation
for a display at the Paris Exposition, "provided
ground space can be obtained for a distinctive South
ern California exhibit."
The action of the southern delegates in holding this
non-partisan gathering for the purpose of agreeing
upon legislation favorable to that section of the State
is to be commended. It would be well for Central
and Northern California to follow the example. The
interests of the counties and the section they repre
sent cannot be too carefully studied by legislators,
and whatever tends to make that study more compre
hensive and more thorough is in itself desirable.
While all that is to be admitted it is none the less
true that there are limits beyond which the service of
a delegate to his district or his section should not go.
That limit is fixed by the requirements of the ser
vice he owes to the State as a whole. The southern
delegates, in agreeing to support a State display at
the Paris Exposition only upon the proviso that
Southern California is to have ground space for a
distinctive exhibit, have overstepped that limit. They
should stand for the State display, whether there is
to be space tor strictly sectional exhibits or not.
It is to be borne in mind that it does not rest with
any one in California to determine the amount of
space the State is to have. The Parisians have the
first voice in the matter. The exposition officials of
the United States are next in authority. It will be
for them and not for us to determine the amount of
space to be allotted to California, and if the space be
not sufficient to permit subdivision for sectional or
county displays without destroying the effectiveness
of the whole, it will not do for us to refuse to make a
display at all.
The French have granted to the United States a
larger space than to any other nation, but the United
States is a large country, and every State in it will
demand a portion of the allotted area. The rich
States of the East, the newly awakened common
wealths of the South, the thriving region of the Mis
sissippi Valley, and the vast domain of the mountain
States from Colorado to Idaho, will each have its
claim allowed.
California cannot expect to receive a very large
area. She must manage to make the best use of what
is allotted to her. The Southern California delegates
should, therefore, reconsider their agreement of Mon
day and stand in for a grand State display at Paris
upon the best terms that can be obtained. Where the
interests of the State are at stake, there should be no
sectionalism.
THAT OAKLAND CITY MALL.
IMMEDIATELY after the defeat of the bond
proposition to pay a quarter of a million for a
small part of the Adams land for an Oakland park
Mayor Thomas said that he had an ofTer of $600,000
for the City Hall Park, and that half of it would buy
the Adams land and the other half would get a site
and build a new City Hall in some part of the city
where land is less valuable.
A year ago the matter of selling the City Hall site
was broached and a committee was appointed by
the Council to consider its feasibility. This commit
tee did not report and was recently discharged, and
another was appointed with Mr. Brosnahan as chair
man.
As soon as the scheme was made public the Mer
chants' Exchange condemned it, and all sorts of ar
guments for and against it have been made by per
sons whose opinions werÂ» solicited.
It seems that Oakland's reform charter contains
a joker on this subject, which has escaped attention
until now. That charter authorizes the City Council
to sell city property and invest the proceeds as it
thinks best, without any reference to the people or
their wish.
The proposition to buy the Adams land for a park,
with forty years to pay for it, having been beaten so
recently, it is not credible that the peopL would now
indorse its purchase for near a third of a million.
Mayor Thomas has not and will not make public
the name of the proposed purchaser. Mr. Brosnahan
has said that he knows parties who will contribute
$40,000 toward buying a new City Hall site, but he
withholds their names. Because of the charter pro
vision and the absolute independence of the City
Council to do as it pleases with city property there
under, the scheme takes on features whicn are spread
ing a feeling of uneasiness and alarm among the peo
ple. Such a provision is clearly against public policy.
Under it a Council may sell property that is increas
ing in value and may go into any scheme for the pur
chase of other property, to the individual advantage
of members, and no other citizen be any the wiser.
That the City Hall is inadequate is a fact. But in
view of the movement, which will soon succeed, to
consolidate a city and county government, the feel
ing is that this valuable property should stand as it
is, for under consolidation the county buildings will
be ample for public use, and then this property could
be sold for more than it will bring in these days of
depression and the proceeds can be applied as a sink
ing fund to clear off the existing bonded debt of the
city and to construct a much needed system of inter
cepting sewers, which are every day becoming more
necessary to the health of the city.
The Mayor and the members of the Council who
are pushing the matter have certainly not increased
public confidence in their scheme by the air of mys
tery and secrecy with which they have surrounded it.
for it has the earmarks of a "clean-up" at the end of
their official term.
0 HOUSE FOR THE EXECUTIVE.
SINCE the law requires that the Governor of
California shall live at the capital, there should
be provided for him a suitable residence. This
fact is emphasized just now by the vain search of the
Governor-elect for a house fitted for the purposes of
a four years' residence, and yet within the bounds of
reason as to cost.
Many times have bills providing for an executive
mansion been introduced, only to be killed by the
j jealousy among realty cliques. The State is bigger
' than any realty clique of Sacramento, and the time
has come for it to assert its will. The petty squabbles
between agents who have town lots to sell should
no longer be permitted to cut any figure in a matter
of such interest and of such importance. A residence
fqr the Governor of California would not be for the
benefit of any one man. Governors pass in rapid
succession. The residence would belong to the com
monwealth, and aid in upholding the dignity of the
State. There should be a place in which the chief
officer could receive distinguished visitors who call
upon him not as upon an individual, but as upon the
chosen representative of the whole people. To pro
vide accommodations is a duty the people owe to
themselves, to their own dignity; it is a mere matter
of self-respect.
For an incoming Governor to make any recom
mendation in these premises might be construed as
an instance of bad taste, but the outgoing Governor
can do it without in any manner subjecting his motives
tc adverse criticism. For Governor Budd to advocate
the erection of a home for the Governor would be, just
as he retires, a graceful and gracious act. We hope
that he will do so. Doubtless the Legislature would
act according to his suggestion. California is large
and rich. The Governor stands for the whole people
of the State. The salary he gets is not great. Made
greater by the addition of a home during the term of
service, it would be no whit too much.
Californians favor an executive mansion. There are
too many of them longer to be overridden by a self
ish few. Governor Budd has in his power, by a
simple word, to impel the Legislature to perform the
act of providing for one. To do so would be a cour
tesy to the old executive and the new, as well as to
the long line to follow. The cost would be small, and
the possession of such a mansion would relieve each
Governor of embarrassment, while putting California
on the plane of other States no more able nor willing
to erect a home for the administration.
THE FRIENDS OF
HUMANITY ARE
DISCREDITED
Deception Alleged by
Organized Labor.
QUEER CHARITY PROPOSITION
FIVE PEOPLE CONSTITUTE THE
ASSOCIATION.
Women's Co-operative Sewing Society
Is Under the Ban of the Trades
Unions and Makes a
Statement.
The executive committee of the San
Francisco Labor Council has been busy
for the past week running down an or
ganization which It characterizes as a
fraud, preying upon the trades union men
of the city. The organization in question
Is known as the Women's Co-operative
Sewing Society, conducted by the Friends
of Humanity.
Representatives of this organization
called at a recent meeting of the Labor
Council and tried to dispose of tickets
for an entertainment to be held next Sat
urday evening. They said that the organ
ization was composed of sewing women
and that it was run on the co-operative
plan. The Labor Council is not inclined
to take anybody's word without investi
gation, so it placed the matter in the
hands of the executive committee.
The executive committee called at the
headquarters of the Society of the Friends
of Humanity on New Montgomery street
and found a great bare room containing
three sewing machines and a pressing
table. Three women were working. They
were Joanna Wayne, president of the so
ciety; Mrs. Ansden, vice president, and
M. E. Knott, treasurer.
A careful inquiry elicited the informa
tion that the society is not co-operative
in any sense of the word. It is run by the
three women already mentioned and two
persons whose names were not disclosed.
These five comprise tie association and
have done the most of the work received
up to date. When they have more than
they can handle they hire somebody to
assist them, but the helpers have no share
In the profits. Tht^y are simply employed
by the association at the ruling wages
or a trifle over.
The three women mentioned have made
a systematic canvass of trades unions
and have received considerable . assist
ance, as they have always claimed to be
representatives of a co-operative organi
zation. They have always been accom
panied by two men and it is stated on
good authority that these two men are
the two silent partners in the concern.
Monday night they called on the Coast
Seamen's Union at East and Mission
streets and told the usual ..ale. A mem
ber of the executive committee of the La
bor Council happened to be present at
the time and he denounced the alleged
co-operative union as a fraud. He said
it was simply a company formed to take
contracts for work and the majority of
the workers were given wages instead of
a dividend from the profits.
At the next meeting of the Labor Coun
cil the whole affair will be denounced aa
a fraud and subordinate unions warned to
kf-^p away from it.
A representative of The Call called upon
Mrs. Wayne yesterday afternoon and she
freely acknowledged that none but the
original five had voice or vote in the af
fairs of the association. She said that "If
a crowd of old women pot in there would
be no managing of affairs, as everybody
would want to run it; so the original five
decided to keep it to themselves. At pres
ent the profits are divided among the
original five, but we may make different
arrangements later on if all goes well."
ANNUAL DIVISION OF
THE COUNTY MONEYS
SUPERVISORS WORKING OVER
APPORTIONMENTS.
Fire Department May Get an Addi
tional $71,000 for Much-Needed
Improvements.
There will be a supervisorial caucus at
11 o'clock this morning &t which the seg
regation and apportionment of funds for
the next fiscal year will be considered.
The Finance Committee of the board met
yesterday morning and spent its session In
the discussion of the extra funds that will
be required by the Fire Department.
A number of improvements projected by
the department, notably the new engine
house in the Sunset District, and other
necessary tire apparatus, and the purchase
of a lot and suitable building for the hous
ing of the water tower at some place
south of Market street, in the vicinity of
the Palace Hotel, will necessitate addi
tional funds to the extent of 571,000, and
this amount the committee yesterday
practically agreed to apportion.
When the matter comes up In caucus to
day, however. Supervisor Rottanzi pro
poses to fight its passage. Rottanzi claims
that the Police Department is in more
need of immediate improvement than the
tiro people, and, with Chief Lees, he has
set his heart upon the new station that it
is proposed to build at Seventeenth and
Fofsom streets. Rottanzi Is backed by
Delany, atui a warm time is promised
when the discussion opens this morning.
The Fire Committee was also in session
and passed favorably upon a number of
important communications and petitions
affecting the department. The petition
of the Sunset District Improvement Club
for a $15,000 appropriation for an engine
house, fire apparatus, a hose wagon and
enough lire hydrants to assure the safety
of the district -was passed, as was a com
munication from the department recom
mending the purchasing of two monitor
batteries and six hose wagons. The second
petition of the Sunset District Club for a
second appropriation of $20,000 was re
ferred to the Chief Engineer of the de
partment.
The Sunnystde Improvement Club's pe
tition for fire alarm boxes at the corners
of Chenery and Diamond and Bunnyilde
avenue and p.aden street was also al
lotted, and the firm of Oilyou fk Caldle
will be granted permission* to erect at
Central Park a steeplechase railway If the
Fire Wardens agree that it will not be a
menace to surrounding property.
The board will meet in special session at
2 o'clock this afternoon.

AMONG THE WHEELMEN.
The Famous San Francisco Road Club
Has Disbanded.
The San Francisco Road Club, one of the
foremost cycling organizations in the city,
has disbanded. This course was decided
upon at a^meeting of the board of direc
tors held yesterday, and to-day the effects
of the club house at 503 Golden Gate ave
nue will be removed and sold, and the club
will be non est.
The road club was organized about
four years ago in the heydey of cycling
popularity and for several years held a
prominent place In the sport here. Latter
ly the Interest has been waning, and the
directors thought best to close its career
while the association was still solvent.
The club therefore goes down with colors
flying. Some of the members Will contin
ue their pleasant social relations of the
past by holding weekly meetings at one
another's houses, and others will be ab
sorbed by the remaining clubs.
Frank J. Cotter, the speedy Olympia,
Wash., professional rider, arrived here
yesterday and will probably remain here
permanently.
C. M. ("Bunt") Smith, the noted record
breaker, has joined the Bay City Wheel-
men.
The annual election of the Associated
Cycling Clubs will be held next Saturday
night at the Olympic Club, and a good deal
of interest is being talten in it by the or
ganized cyclers. The control of the asso
ciation means a good deal to the racing
clubs, and they are all pulling wires to at
tain that end. The session promises to be
a lively one.
THE NEW YEAR TO
BRING NEW SCHEDULES
PLANS OF THE SOUTHERN PA
CIFIC COMPANY.
Los Angeles to Get a Better Service.
More Freight Facil
ities.
The first of the year will see great im
provement In the passenger and freight
service of the Southern Pacific. In speak
ing of the practically new service that
.will shortly be inaugurated Manager
Kruttschnitt said yesterday:
"The southern Pacific has just ordered
1-000 new boxcars of thirty tons capacity
each. This order has been placed with
the companies of Barney & Smith of
Dayton. Ohio, and Ensign of Huntington,
West Virginia. The road has also or
dered eighty more ballast cars. These
will be built by Wells & French of Chi
cago.
"There have just been put in use on the
heavy grades over Tehachapi six com
pound mastodon freight locomotives.
These engines are the most powerful of
their kind ever built and have just be*n
delivered. They will be followed by the
first of the year by six consolidated en
gines that are 12 per cent heavier, and all
of these will be used on the grades over
the Tehachapi. The Southern Pacific
has also ordered forty-five other locomo
tives for use on its Atlantic and Pacific
system. Many of these are of the kind
known as the" Mogul freight engines, and
are for use through Texas. Arizona and
New Mexico. The contracts for this im
mense amount of improvement material
was let by the New Yrk office of the
Southern Pacific."
For the past year the business between
San Francisco and Los Angeles has been
so heavy that it has been difficult for the
through trains to make schedule time.
We are contemplating the putting on in
the near future of a purely local service,
which will enable the overland trains to
attend only to the through business.
This will enable both the through and lo
cal trains to give a better service. The
business of th>> road between here and
Los Angeles has entirely outgrown the
capacity of one train.
"The passenger service will also be
greatly improved by the putting on of
many' new coaches and sleepers that
have been especially ordered. These will
be in service by the first of the year."

United States Revenue Agent Bert
Thomas has become tired of waiting for
retail dealers and others to obey the rev
enue laws and pay their proportion of tho
war revenue, and yesterday made two
sample arrests, which will be followed by
more to-day.
The first victim was Joseph Palisi, the
keeper of a fruit and ice cream soda stand
at the corner of California and LeidesdorfC
streets. Palisi was charged with -aving
taken chewing gum out of the original
stamped packages and placing it in the
Bhow case. The law requires, as in the
case of cigars, that the articles must bo
sold from the original stamped packages.
Palisi pleaded ignorance of the law, but
that will not be considered by the Govern
ment as a defense.
Collector Lynch recently received from
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a
letter on the subject of chewing gum, of
which the following is an extract:
You will advise them that chewing gum muÃt
be sold at retail from the original Package
and I'lace the same in the showcase. There iÂ»
a wide difference between chewing gum vend
ing machines and showcase. The gum may be
sold and delivered directly from the machine,
without assistance from any person, and tha
regulation does not apply to showcases, and
you will so advise. There is no regulatioa per
mitting the manufacturer to distribute free
samples of chewing gum upon which t&Â» tax
has not been paid.
Later in the day Deputy Internal Rev
enue Collector Fletcher swore to a,com
plaint made out by Assistant Lfhited
States Attorney Woodwortfi for the arrest
of G. Pouchau and Louis Schlatter, pro
prietors of the St. Germaine Restaurant,
33 O'Farrell street, for serving wine to
guests without affixing a 2-cent . war
stamp to each bottle of more than a pint.
It 13 alleged that the accused have
stamped their bottles once and kept on re
filling them without removing the old
stamp and putting on new ones every time
the bottles were filled. M. Pouchau was
arrested, and was released on giving
bonds in the sum of $500. Schlatter will bo
arrested this morning.

CALIFORNIA FRUIT HAS NO SAN
JOSE SCALE.
European Dealers Plot to Keep West

Markets â Get Govern
ment Aid.
Dispatches from "Washington state that
the French Government has sent notice
to thi .State axtment to the effect that
precautionary measures would be taken
to prevent the Introduction of the San
Jose scale into France on trees, shrubs
and fruits, dried and fresh. The pro
posed measure is very similar to those of
Holland and Germany. Another dispatch
announces that a lot of California dried
fruits had; been seized in Berlin, con
demned' and ordered re-exported for the
same ason. California shippers and
orehardists are greatly disgusted at the
needless alarm of the officials cf the Kuro
pean countries mentioned. The con
d< mned lot is probably a consignment of
dried pears that were sent to Berlin by
the Johnson-Locke Company of this city.
The fruit was removed to London and the
local firm's agents were instructed to
send back samples of the alleged Infected
products. v
S These samples were submitted to A.
larantine officer of the California
State Horticultural Society, who after a
careful examination of the fruit stated
that it contained no scale nor any indica
tion of being infected. The local firm
began to think that there was something
behind the condemnation, and asked the
State Board of Trade to lend its as^ist
ance in getting at the bottom of the
matter. Jvlr. Filcher at once sent the fol
lowing letter to Washington:

RESTRICTIONS UPON
EXPRESS COMPANIES
TO HAVE THEM UNDER THE IN
TERSTATE COMMERCE LAW.
A Movement to Get Congress to Re
taliate for the Nonpayment of
the War Revenue Tax.
The refusal of the express companies of
the United States to pay their part of the
war revenue tax is likely to prove their
undoing. There is a movement now on
foot among- the merchants df the entire
country to have the business of the ex
presa companies, put under the interstate
commerce laws, which- will be the means
of clipping their wings to such an extent
that exorbitant rates, such as have been
charged, will be prevented. The personnel
of the people leading this movement is
about the same as that of the anti-ticket
scalping organization and the body that is
now making a move toward getting a re
duction' i>n postal package rates and an
International equalization of the same.
Last e\ening a banquet wad held in St.
Louis a! which the anti-ticket scalping
project was discussed, with a view to
having the next Congress make a law pro
hibiting the practice of ticket scalping.
At that gathering some of the wealthiest
merchants, wholesalers and railroad men
of the middle West and West assembled.
This is the second meeting of its kind, the
first beiiig held in Chicago on October 5.
From information obtained by the Califor
nia Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation from their representative, Frank
L. Brown, now In the East, the next ban
quet will be devoted to the subject tlrst
mentioniMl, the bringing of the express
companies under the interstate commerce
laws. Already the people of the entire
I'nited States have been discussing the
case of the companies who have refused
to pay their part of the war tax, and the
helplessness of the merchants and the
public in general. Test cases that were
supposed to settle the matter have been
heard in many parts of the country, and
still the companies compel the people to
pay the tax of both.
The question was raised as to what
could be done to force the derelict corpor
ations to feel the might of the law and the
suggestion was made that it could only be
done by having Congress pass a bill plac
ing the companies under the interstate
laws. Tliis would throw them under the
supervision of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, to which body the companies
would have to submit a report of all their
business. The national committee would
compel a sliding scale on the rates, similar
to the long and short haul clause under
which tlv railroads operate. Furthermore,
the expn-ss rates would be passed upon by
the commission to determine the justness
thereof. Another point would he that the
companies would have to publish any
change In tariff. Still another interesting
restriction would be that an express pool
would bÂ«> impossible.
The local commercial bodies are heartily
in sympathty with the efforts of their
brother organizations in the East.
Claims She Is an Heir.
Next. Tuesday a crosa petition for the
distribution of the estate of the late Jose
Vicente de Laveaga, filed by Dolores
Apolonia de Revera-de Laveaga. will be
argued before Judge Coffey. Dolores Ap
olonia do Revera-de I^aveaga claims to
be the daughter of Jrme Maria de La
vpaga and Jesus Bustillo. Whether they
were married or not she is unable to
state, but as Jose Maria de Laveaga was
a brother of Jose Vicente <1Â« Laveaga
she claims to be an heir-at-law of the
latter. In consequence she asks that
one-fourth of the estate of Jose Vicente
which remains undisposed of by will,
valued at $841,000, be distributed to her.

After the Becker Forgery-

"Walter Rosser. the youthful soldier who
shot and killed Henry Hildebrar.d In the
Spreckels Market on September 13 last,
must again stand trial for his crime.
After being out all night the jury reported
to Judge Wallace yesterday morning that
It could not reach an agreement. It was
stated that as to matters of law regard
ing the crime all agreed, and were gov
erned solely by the Instructions of the
court, but as to matters of fact they were
divided, and hopelessly divided, six of the
Jurors insisting that the prisoner should
be acquitted, while six were equally de
termined to hold the prisoner guilty of
murder in the second degree. Such being
the case, Judge Wallace discharged the
jury. .:'.;'
General Barnes, of counsel for the de
fendant, then asked the court to 3et as
early a date as possible for tho second j
trial, explaining that the father of the I
young man was not wealthy and could j
111 afford to remain here away from his
business. Judge Wallace stated that it
would be impossible to set the case for Im
mediate retrial, as the Becker forgery
case must nrst be disposed ofi This will \
occupy over a week, but at its conclusion '
Rosser's case will again be taken up.
Considerable surprise was expressed that
the jury failed to rind the defendant guilty ;
of manslaughter at least. Upon the charge ,
delivered by Judge Wallace it was impos- !
sible to find the prisoner guilty of murder j
in the first degree. The malice and pre- |
meditation necessary to complete this <
crime were wanting. The question there
fore remained. Was Rosser's crime com- j
mitted In the heat of passion, through |
drink or other excitement, or was he suf
fering from the effects of poison and un
conscious of his act? Six of the Jurors
held that he was not mentally responsible, ;
while six declared that he was. Such be- !
ing the case, another trial must be had.

STRONG STATEMENTS.
Three "Women Relieved of Female
Troubles by Mrs. Pinkham.
From Mrs. A. W. Smith, 59 Summer
St., Biddeford, Me.:
"For several years I suffered with
various diseases peculiar to my sex.
Was troubled with a burning sensation
across the small of my back, that all-
gone feeling, was despondent, fretful
and discouraged; the least exertion
tired me. I tried several doctors but
received little benefit. At last I de-
cided to give your Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound a trial. The ef-
fect of the first bottle was magical.
Those symptoms of weakness that I
was afflicted with, vanished like vapor
before the sun. I cannot speak too
highly of your valuable remedy. It is
truly a boon to woman."
From Mrs. Mkmssa. Phii-Mps, Lex-
ington, Ind., to Mrs. Pinkham:
"Before I began taking your medicine
I had suffered for two years with that
tired feeling, headache, backache, noap-
petite, and a run-down condition of the
system, I could not walk across the
room. I have taken fo\ir bottles of the
Vegetable Compound, one box of Liver
Pills and used one package of Sanative
Wash, and now feel like a new woman,
and am able to do my work. "
From Mrs. Moixie E. Herrei., Pow-
ell Station, Term.:
"For three years I suffered with snch a
weakness of the back, I could not
perform my household duties, I also
had falling of the womb, terrible bear-
ing-down pains and headache. I have
taken two bottles of Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound and feel
like a new woman. I recommend your

I am acquainted with the case of the wife of a Tionse ptfnter IB
Brooklyn, who had the grip, and was confined to the house for three
months. She was in a listless state and suffered terribly with nausea,
It so happened that a friend had given some Ripans Tabules to thif
lady's sister who had suffered from indigestion, and as they did her so
tnuch good she thought she would try them on Mrs. Hill, feeling saw
that if they did her no good they would at least do no harm. Tho
patient was then in the hands of her physician, but soon she was so
much better that her neighbors noticed the change and asked about
It. She then said that she had changed her doctor, and laughingly
added, my new doctor is colored chocolate color. It seems that as
â¢ooq as she began to take the Tabules, she began to mend. The
BMfiea disappeared and she began to fed that, the ftttaw sdll had
days of sunsbine in store for hat.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â Profit taking was the
order on the Stock Exchange to-day. Some at
tempt was made to resist the declining tend
ency, but the persistent selling to realize dis
couraged the effort and support was finally
withdrawn throughout the list. Yesterday's
strong demand for London account fell off to
day, as it was generally supposed it would
when the effect or this buying on sterling ex
change was remarked. The approach of ex
change to the gold import point resulted in
an advance in the private discount rate in
London a^ain to-day, and this caused a rise
in London exchange at Berlin, which continues
to be the real center of the pressing need of,
money. London ceased to buy Americans, un
der Ihe stress of this threatening condition in
the exchange market. Nevertheless the stock
market showed advances at the opening here
and was sustained by heavy buying of the
Grangers on the Burlington statement. It was I
evident, however, a part of the recent buying j
of Grangers was in anticipation of this state
ment, and the same was evidently true of I
Union Pacific, which, with a large increase in
gross earnings and reduction in operating ex
penses, showed an additiun to the surplus of
$307,891. The publicationof these statements was .
therefore met with heavy realizing in South- j
crn Pacific and a number of specialties, includ
ing an extreme rise of r.V* in Sugar and an '
upward movement also of some of the low-, j
priced stocks remote from any dividend j
chances. But these were insufficient to coun- :
teract the general downward tendency, which ;
finally prevailed and made the closing weak â¢
at the lowest prices generally for the day.
Edison Illuminating' of New York made a con
spicuous advance of 14 points to 165.
There was strength of a few point 3 In the
bond market, but. the general tendency of
prices was downward in sympathy with stocks.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: Stocks were
generally good here to-day, with a ellght re
vival of activity in all the speculative markets.
Speculative interest in Americans undoubtedly
rrowi but opinions as regards a continuance
of the rise are much divided. Those who are
inclined to lie pessimistic have an eye to the
meeting ot < '.ir.Kress next month. The feature
to-day in Americans was the sharp rise in
Central Pacific, which was bought here and
from Germany. Prices of Americans closed un
der the best. New York has been bidding for
p Id in the open market, but It was outbid by
Germany at 77s 11 %d.
New York exchange is watched closely,
though leading American houses here say New

. CHICAGO, Nov. 29.â The immediate opening
in wheat was rather dull, May starting at a
decline of *4c and December I ,iÂ©'%o lower. Liv
i erpool, failed 10 respond to yesterday's advance
I here and Northwest receipts were very heavy.
j That gave the market the easy opening. Re
! ports that a heavy snowstorm prevailed in the
I Dakotas, suggesting consequent decreases in
j receipts, was apparently, the only reason for a I
' brief advance. Then followed a period of de- |
pression which lasted until about 11 o'clock. j
After this the market became linnet Closing i
cables, notably from Paris, showed^trength, |
itnd seaboard r.eports were excellent. Strength â¢
i in corn also helped to create the demand here. !
â¢ "The demand gradually fell off, however, and ';
during the last thirty minutes' " trading- the â 
; market was quite weak. December finally de- :
â¢ clined to tS%C and closed at 65?i@66c.
I Corn, though having periods of depression,
was in the main firm. Prices advanced during
the morning, but the advantage was lost when
wheat weakened. May closed unchanged.
Oats followed corn very closely. There was
only a fair business transacted. Closed un- i
changed. - â¢ â â â â â â â 
Provisions were dull but firm. in the face of I
; heavy receipts of hogs. Room traders as a '
I rule were bullish. Shorts took advantage of j
I the natural business to cover and there was I
also some buying for the long account. Pack- I
, ers were moderate sellers. There was some j

HIDES, TALLOW, WOOL AND HOPS.
Some dealers are quoting a weaker market
for Hops. Hides are quiet and unchanged.
Tallow is firmer.
A local circular says of Wool: "Some small
sales of Wool are being made, but no large
business is In sight. The Bales are chiefly made
through constant forwarding of samples to
Eastern dealers, and where they are pleased
with a sample and can get inducements In
prices they will buy. As to local operations
they don't talk Wool. The Ukiah and Clover
dale sales of fall Wool, which were recently
held, had a bad effect upon the trade. Prices
ruled there 7o to 9c for average lots and no
spirit was shown to buy at this extremely low
quotation. Not that the Wools were not worth
more, because they brought as much or more
under frfe trade conditions, but because spec
ulators and manufacturers are wholly Indif
ferent as to Wool prices, feeling that stocks are
too large for the time being to operate with
any safety as to results."

A VERY CLEVER TRAVESTY
PRESENTED BY MEMBERS OF
EUENA VISTA PARLOR.
The Novel Entertainment Was De
cidedly Amusing and Was
Well Received by a Large
Audience.
Native Sons' Hall was crowded last
night at the production of "The Influen
ftial Order of Chocolate Bonbons," a nov
elty presented by eighteen young ladies of
Buena Vista Parlor, Native Daughters of
the Golden West. It wag a clever travesty
on secret orders, arranged by E. C. Davis,
and was one or the very best of the many
entertainments given by this parlor.
The stage was fitted up as a large room,
and the lady members, who each repre
sented a particular bonbon, had their
faces, with the exception of four, tinted
of a chocolate color, while the other four
appeared as Darktown belles. In the pre
sentation of the ritualistic work and the
initiation of a candidate, there was a
great deal of mock solemnity which
caused a great deal of mirth. â :
'I he work of the evening was inter
spersed with vocal selections admlrably
rendered and received with liberal ap
plause.
As an Introduction to the entertain
ment there was an eloquent address on
the work of the Native Daughters, de
livered by Mrs. Genevleve Baker, a mem
ber of the parlor.

> Under the head of good of the order
4 â¢here was an animated debate on a propo
sition to admit men into the four walls of
the lodge of women. All the members
spoke against the proposition, and when
the question, "Shall the men be ad
mitted? was put, every member voted
In the affirmativ.-. Then entered D B

PRIMAEY ELECTION LAW.
Max Popper of the Iroquois Club Op
posed to Proposed New Measure.
rdir.g to T. Carl Spelling, it Is cvi
â¢ Max Popper of the Iroquois
t'lub is not satisfied with the primary
:. law as incorporated In the last
State platforms of the Republican and
J'f-mocratic parties. This intended law is
the work of an interparty conference held
me time ago. The bill was drawn up
by T. Carl Spelling before the campaign
opened, and was referred by the general
conference to a .Â«Ã¼b-eommittee composed
Of three Democrats and three Republl
i ana. They rep irted favorably, and it
wan again referred to the sub-committee
that the bill was put in the form
of a statute. This was supposed to end
.itter as far aa the general com
mittee was concerned, but Popper has
agitating for another meeting- ever
since, and finally got one last night.
Xin<". iK-mnrrats were present and net one
â  lican. The Republicans consider the
work at an end, and approve of the law
;<-= Indorsed in the State platform.
Nothing w;:s done at the meeting last
night except to henr Senator Stratton,
who expects to Introduce a primary law of
hla own at the next Legislature, and a
discussion of the bill fol
lowed. The criticisms of Max Popper
and Charles Gildea were fully an
swered, and the general conference will
not accomplish anything- more. The meet
ing adjourned until next Monday, to give
Senator Stratton a further hearing in re
gard to his bill. That is why Spelling says
it looks as If Popper is desirous to per
petuate the organization of the Commit
0nÂ« Hundred, which Is not. par*
tlcularly anxious to have primaries held

POSTUM CEREAL.
SICK SCHOOL CHILDREN.
A Teacher Speaks of the Cause.
I have charge of the second gTade in
the public schools here, and 'trace near-
ly every case of headache among these
children to improper feeding. When a
Bfck child is asked what was had for
breakfast, the rerly almost universally
includes a cup of coffee.
An illustration is that of my sister's
oldest boy, Will Wilson of Lennox,
lowa. For a long time he had no appe-
tite for breakfast, but insisted on cof-
fee, which they would give him, weak-
< nod some with cream, but no matter
how little coffee he had, it brought on
his bad spells. Since they have been
using Postum Food Coffee in their fam-
ily the boy is well and can have all of
the Postum Coffee he wants for break-,
fast.
1 was ordered by my physician to
lit the use of coffee some time ago,
1 for my sick spells were directly trace-
able to it, but I could not quit its use
until I found Postum. Then the change
did not disturb me in the slightest.
The old troubles have disappeared.
I have a long list of friends who use
Postum and enjoy it very much, but
in every case they have had to learn
that Postum is only good when It is
boiled long enough to bring out the
flavor. Margaret Scroggs, 24 W. 14th

A SURPRISE
Downed Piggott on
Don Gara a Head.
TAME SPORT AT OAKLAND
JONES LANDS POLKA FIRST AT
12 TO 1.
Rey del Xieira Enjoyed a Gallop.
Casdale Defeated Espionage With
out Effort â Two Favorites
Finished in Front.
The racing at Oakland yesterday was
droll and lonesome-looking, failing to
create either comment or excitement. It
was a card given over to the cheaper class
of horses, and this fact, coupled with the
Bticky condition of the track and the un
certain state of the weather, depressed
the money market. Long shots escaped
with the first two purses, after which two
favorites and a second choice enlivened
proceedings somewhat by winning.
A number of new horses made their ini
tial appearance in the opening scramble
over the Futurity course, and the unex
pected was looked for. It happened when
Durward, with Johnny Reiff In the sad
dle, came splashing along and, at odds of
10 and 12 to 1, beat the favorite, Don Gara,
a head. Piggott rode the latter, and his
mount tired badly the last sixteenth of a
mile. Schnitz was well supported, and
proved a costly experiment for many. Nu
merous wild tips ail went astray.
Twelve maiden two-year-olds next fur
nished a knotty betting problem at five
furlongs. Klizabeth R and Silver Beaux
were the most fancied, but neither could
land. Eddie Jones got the 12 to 1 shot,
Polka, carrying the colors of "Kentucky
John" Glvens away In front, and was
never headed. The outsider grew weary
as the wire was approached, but hung on.
getting the decision by a length irom
Peter Weber, another outsider. Elizabeth
R wa? third.
Bullman. who no longer rides with the
"reverse English" on. and Is rapidly earn
ing a reputation, had the mount on Key
del Tierra in the mile selling run. Purser's
horse, was a 3 UÂ» 5 chance in the ring

no premonition of the trouble ahead for
him. After the horse had won James

Murrv swung a right-hander at Smith
and was later called Into the stand- to ex
plain this breach of turf etiquette. His
explanation must have been a trifle stage

$200. Bill is now repentant and threatens

JUNK FIRST
AND THE DEAD
AFTERWARD
Frugal Lucky Baldwin
Defies the Law.
STILL RESCUING FURNITURE
SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC IS NOT
CONSIDEBED.
The Stench From the Ruins Is In
creasing and May Attract the
Attention of the Board
of Health.
The endless throng of curious people
who wandered around the ruins of the
Baldwin Hotel yesterday was surprised
to note that no efforts were being made
to demolish the tall tottering walls that
threaten to topple over into the street at
any moment, carrying death and destruc
tion with their fall.
The name "Lucky" appears to still ap
ply to E. J. Baldwin. The second day
after the fire the Board of Fire Wardens
met and adopted a resolution directed to
Mr. Baldwin, in which he was notified
that the remaining walls of his building
were a menace to life and property, and
he was peremptorily ordered to raze them
forthwith. The aged son of fortune made
a pretense of obeying the law and set
some men to work. They succeeded in
tearing down a small section of the walls
on the Market-street side, and after
breaking a rotten cable a couple of times
suspended their labors, and nothing has
been done since.
It transpires that while these men were
inspecting the ruins they discovered that
there was a great deal of badly damaged
furniture In the partially destroyed rooms.
This was enough for Mr. Baldwin. In
stead of carrying out the instructions, of
the Fire Wardens as any other citizen in
his position would have done, lest there
might be more loss of life on account of
the famous old flretrap, men were em
ployed to risk life and limb in the salvage
of the furnishings of the hostelry.
The rights of pedestrians and travelers
in streetcars, as well as those of property
owners on opposite sides of the streets
from the Baldwin, . were totally ignored,
and the scramble to recover rubbish to be
sold to the junkman has- continued.
Thpse facts were very generally and se-.
verely commented upon yesterday, and
wonder was expresed that the Fire
Wardens have not forced Mr. Baldwin to
observe their admonitions. ::>';"
A number of years ago, In discoursing
upon one of his escapades with a member
of the fair sex, Mr. Baldwin quoted the
language of Commodore Vanderbiltâ
"the public be d." This policy seems
to have been pursued since the recent
tragic fire. The fact that distracted re
latives and friends are anxiously waiting
to remove the remains of their loved ones
has apparently not concerned the owner
of the Baldwin so much as the few dol
lars/that could be gained by taking out
damaged furniture. The-santiary ques
tion has also been entirely overlooked by
Mr. Baldwin.
Yesterday in two separate sections of
the ruins the stench, presumably arising
from decaying bodies, was overpowering.
These pestilential odors arose from near
the west wall of the theater and In the
wreckage where the bar was formerly lo
cated. It is probable that If duf> haste is
not shown in the removal of the debris
the Board of Health will take a hand and
see that the rights of the public aro pro
tected.
It is possible that the work of tearing
down the ruin will begin soon. Madison
& Burke yesterday received forty bids for
the contract, which, It is announced, will
be let to-day. ;â â  - â 
A great lot of junk was removed yester
day, and it was stated on good authority
that some of those engaged in the work
were not risking their necks for the small
wages paid, but for the valuables that
had been left by the unfortunate guests
In their flight from the burning building.
In some of the apartments these pick
ings were rich, but they were not turned
over to Mr. Baldwin.
NAVAL MEN BEST TO
RULE THE ISLANDS
CONGRESSMAN NEWLANDS AT
THE UNITARIAN CLUB.
Judge Morrow of the Opinion That
Congress Can Provide Any
Form of Government.
The regular meeting of tho Unitarian
Club was held in the rooms of the Mer
chants" Club, 222 SansomÂ« street, Monday
evening. After disposing of a substan
tial dinner, the members listened to a dis
ADVERTISEMENTS.
A PECULIAR REMEDY.
Something About the New Discovery for
Curing Dyspepsia.
The Rev. F. I. Bell, a highly esteemed
minister residing in "Weedsport, Cayuga
County, N.. V., in a recent letter writes
as follows: "There has never been
anything that I have taken that has re-
lieved the Dyspepsia from which I have
suffered for ten years except the new
remedy called Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets. Since taking them I have had no
distress at all after eating, and again
after long years can sleep well. Rev.
F. I. Bell, Weedsport, N. V., formerly
Idalia, Colo." :v:
Stuart's Dypepsia Tablets Is a re-
markable remedy, not only because it
is a certain cure for all forms of In-
digestion, but because it seems to act
as thoroughly in old chronic cases of
dyspepsia as well as in mild attacks of
Indigestion or biliousness. A person has
dyspepsia simply because the stomach
is overworked, all it wants is a . harm-
less vegetable remedy to digest. the food
and thus give it the much-needed rest.
This is the secret of the success of
this peculiar remedy. No matter how
weak or how much disordered the di-
gestion may be, Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will digest the food whether the
stomach works or not. New life and
energy is given not only to the stomach
but to every organ and nerve In the
body. A trial of this splendid medicine
will convince the most skeptical that
Dyspepsia and all stomach troubles can
be cured. The tablets are prepared by i
the F. A. Stuart, Company of Marshall, I
Mich., but so popular has the remedy j
become that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
can now be obtained at any drug store
at 50 cents per package. Send for book
on stomach diseases free.

731 "i* IKScO I Elcv.fr Entrance.
cussion on the "Lessons and Results of
the Late War." by Judge W. W. Mor
row, William Clayton Plekersglll. British
Consul General, Congressman Newlands
of Nevada and Rev. Horatio Stebbins.
The discussion was opened by Mr. New
lands, who spoke mainly of the problems
consequent upon the acquisition of Ha
waii, Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philip
pine group, and the problem of govern
ing the latter in case they are annexed.
He said:
"The scheme of outgrowth as a nation
has made necessary the acquisition of
Islands contiguous to our coast, which. In
the event of war, might be made the base
of attack by a foreign foe.
"In the future the navies of the world
will be concentrated on the Asiatic coast,
but no attack on our shores can be made
without a coaling station. The Hawaiian
Islands offer this.
"We have been drifting Into a policy
and now we have drifted so far that we
cannot go back. We cannot drive the
islands back to Spain. That would be a
crime against humanity. We cannot leave
them with the natives. That would be to
give them over to anarchy.
"But there are grave problems involved
in holding them. Their government is a
problem which must be seriously consid
ered. It certainly would not do to hand
them over to politicians, as we have
enough experience with political schemers
right here under our own eyes.
"I think the government and care of the
islands would be perfectly safe In the
hands of the navy."
Consul General Pickersgill was the next
speaker. He did not say much regarding
his opinion as to the best means of dis
posing of the islands, as he said he had
learned by experience that the best Con
sul was the man who said little and
heard much. He was of the opinion, how
ever, that the acquisition of the Islands
would be a good thing for this country,
as the holding of outside possessions is
to a country like travel to a manâ it has
a broadening influence.
Judge Morrow spoke more directly on
the government of the islands under the
constitution. "I look on the acquisition
of outside territory with dismay, he
said "as none can tell what it may mearj
In the end. So far as the governing of
the islands is concerned, however, I
think Congress can govern them as it sees
fit and still live up to the constitution.
The Supreme Court makes a distinction
between a citizen of a State and a man
living In a territory. The one Is under
the constitution, the other under the lawa
made by Congress to govern the partic
ular territory In which he lives. The In
dian Territory is inside the country, yet
it is not governed by the constitution.
The District of Columbia is not only
within our country and protected by our
flag, but is the seat of our Government;
yet Congress has seen fit to decree that
its residents are not even entitled to a
vote and they seem to be well governed,
too. So it Is with the Islands we may re
tain."
Dr. Stebhins confined his remarks to the
moral effects of the war, me greatest of
which was the elimination of party lines.
"No North, no South, no East, no West,
but one united country, united stronger
than ever before."
"Workmen's District Meeting.
A public meting was held Monday night
in B'ne B"rith Hall of District No. 5 of
the Ancient Order of United Workmen,
in which are Valley, Golden Gate and
Golden West lodges. The audience,
in which were many ladies, was addressed
by Grand Master Workman Judge George
H. Bahrs, who explained the merits and
claims of the order and what benefits
are derived from being members thereof.
After that there was a programme of mu
sic and specialties and a talk by Past
Grand Master Barnes, and then dancing
until midnight. The entertainment was
managed by M. J. Blackman, F. O.
Kraull, J. F. Murphy. C. C. McKay, H.

FOUGHT FIRE
NEAR TONS OF
GUNCOTTON
The California Powder
Works in Flames.
CATASTROPHE WAS AVERTED
FLYING SPARKS SET FIRE TO A
RAILROAD TRESTLE.
Wind Helps the Workmen to Hold
the Fire in Check Till
the Danger Was
Past.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 29.
Another disastrous explosion was nar
rowly averted at the California Powder
Works at 2:20 o'clock this morning. The
guncotton department was discovered to
be on fire, and only after vigorous efforts
on the part of employes were the flames
subdued before they reached the adjoin
ing acid department.
It is a peculiarity in the manufacture of
gun cotton that it will n<u at certain stages
iKnite even by the application of fire. It
i< always kept within these stages at
Pinole, being taken to Santa Cruz for de
velopment. One part of the department
consists of a huge room, in which the
cotton is dried after being washed and
before it is mixed with acid. This drying
room frequently contains tons of loose
cotton, much of it fluffy and dusty, which
Is very inflammable. It wa>s in this room
that the fire originated. The llames were
discovered at half-past 2 o'clock, and at
once the flrebell was tolled and several
hundred employes were called to the
Bcene.
The work of fighting the fire was helped
by the wind, which remained in a favora
ble Quarter until all danger was past.
The employes labored with what might oe
called true bravery and indifference to
their own safety, for close to the guncot
ton works are several storehouses con
taining explosives, and a single spark
from the burning cotton-house might nave
produced an explosion. That there was
great danger of flying sparks reaching trie
glycerine-house and other buildings was
proved by the fact that some of the
sparks reached a railroad trestle on the
overland track and set it on fire. It was
ssary to delay all travel until the lire
put out and all possible danger from
a prospective explosion or a burned trestle
was passed. The loss is estimated at
520,000.
The buildings are all of very light con
struction, for obvious reasons. This after
the wreck had been cleared away,
and workmen were busy with the recon
struction. No one was injured, but the
accident will keep many men out of work
for a few weeks. The company has been
working en heavy shifts at double pres
surÂ«- f'>r several months fulfilling an order
for half a million pounds of guncotton and
smokeless powder for the United States
Government.

A? stated in The Call some days ago,
tho Municipal League will probably nomi

circular has been sent out:
Citizens' Municipal League, 1008% Broadway,

economical and progressive government can
better be obtained by nominations and election
conducted by the methods of the Citizens'
Municipal League uwed in March. ls'.'3. when
its nominations were made Independently, and
prior to the other party nominations, and
which resulted !n the election of it 3 nominee

HE COULD SPEAK ENGLISH.
When Denied an Interpreter Manuel
Olevedo Testified in His Wife's
Divorce Suit.
OAKLAND. Nov. 29.â Further hearing
was had before Judge Ogden this after
noon in the divorce suit of Maria R. Ole
.gainst Manuel A. Olevedo, brought
on the ground of cruelty. Mrs. Olevedo
again testified as to being struck by her
husband on her return from a visit to
friends one- evening a year ago.
It developed that the defendant has re-
Bided in California the past forty-two
years, but he had never expressed his de
sire to become a citizen. He claimed,
moreover, when called to the witness
stand to-day, that he could not speak
or understand English. When, however,
the Interpreter was denied him, he made
a very succt'.-sful effort to get along with
out Buch aid, and answered the court's
questions quite readily.
Judge Ogden continued the matter of a
final decision for two weeks. His Honor
intimated that if the decree is granted
there shall also be a division of property
and children, but that In the event of
denying a divorce an order would be made
providing for- the wife's maintenance.
The attorneys were unable to agree on
many points relating to alimony, hence

FEARS THAT
HE WILL KILL
HER SOME DAY
Mrs. Rockhill Beaten
Most Brutally.
A HUSBAND'S CRUEL CONDUCT
HIS MISFORTUNES WIN HER
SYMPATHY.
An Angry Man's Conduct Because
His Wife Failed to Prepare a
Turkey Dinner for
Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 29.
A case of extremest cruelty with a
savor of the Brandes case was investi
gated by Sergeant Peterson to-day by or
der of Chief of Police Fletcher. It is that
of Mrs. Edward Rockhill, residing with
her family at the corner of Forty-third
and Linden streets,, and the story of her
suffering and injuries at the hands of her
husband as told by her is most scan
dalous.
When Sergeant Peterson called at the
Rockhill residence he found the woman
confined to her bed. She stated that Bhe
had been severely beaten by her husband
last Sunday because she had not arranged
a turkey dinner on Thanksgiving day.
Rockhill had struck his wife across the
face with the wooden handle of a large
knife or a piece of woodâ she did not
know which, for as a result of the first
blow her face and eyes were covered with
blood and her face was badly bruised,
while other portions of her body also
showed marks.
According to Mrs. Rockhill's statement,
her little niece, aged 12 years, interfered
at the time, and the woman had thus been
enabled to escape with her life. The in
furiated husband then attempted to strike
the girl with a club, which he finally
threw at her, but it missed its mark and
crashed through a window pane. It is
said, moreover, that the husband, after
knocking his wife down, kicked her.
The unfortunate woman ran to neigh
bors after the terrible beating and they
summoned Dr. Legault, who dressed her
wounds.
Dr. Legault states that when he visited
Mrs. Rockhill she was bleeding freely
from a cut on the bridge of the nuse,
which had been inflicted, he thought, by
a blunt instrument.
Edward Rockhill is employed from time
to time at the Judson Iron Works. He is
a powerful man. The injured woman is
his second wife.
Mrs. Rockhill stated to Sergeant Peter
son that she did not wish to have her as
sailant arrested. She intimated that he is
sometimes out of his right mind because
of his failing eyesight and a mortgage on
their home. During these spells, she said,
he is very violent and she admitted that
she was afraid he would kill her sooner
or later; yet on account of his misfor
tunes she sympathized with him and sim
ply asked for protection.
BRANDES PROTESTED.
Lillian Brandes' Alleged Slayer Ob-
jected to HiÂ« Photo Being Taken.
OAKLAND, Nov. 29. â William A.
Brandts, who, with his wife, is charged
with the murder of his 13-year-old daugh
ter, Lillian, protested most stoutly to-day
when Photographer C. W. Logan called
on him to take his picture for Sheriff
White's rogues' gallery. He said his at
torneys, Bennett & Sawyer, did not wish
him to be photographed, but Deputy Sher
iff Lane Insisted that his photo was very*
essential. Brandes, however, when he
finally faced the camera, dropped his jaw
and in other ways changed his facial ex
pression, hoping thereby to succeed in
giving an unrecognizable picture. Two
views were secured.
MrÂ«. Brandts was also photographed at
the County Jail to-day, but she submitted
without a murmur. Her general appear
ance indicates that she is slowly wasting
away under the great strain.
ANOTHER VIEW OF
SELLING CITY LAND
M. J. KELLER WANTS TO LIVE TO
SEE IMPROVEMENTS.
City Hall Site Would Bring Money
That Might Be Used to
Advantage
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 29.
M. J. Keller, vice-president of the Oak
land Board of Trade, has published a re
ply to the report of the committee of the
Merchants' Exchange on the sale of the
City Hall site. Mr. Keller differs ma
terially from Mr. Sohst. He says:
Considering the prices recently obtained. $700
a'front foot, for contiguous but more favorably
located property in the blocks between Thir
teenth and Fourteenth on Washington street,
it is impossible to figure out the $1,000,000 valu
ation given by Mr. Sohst for the City Hall lot.
In IKB7 the "late Senator James O. Fair Htood
at the southeast corner of Fourteenth street
and Broadway in Oakland, and pointing to
San Pablo avenue, prophetically exclaimed:
"That is bound to be the leading business
street of your city."
How long, it' the City Hall tot is put on the
market, before a fine building rises in place
of the present paltry, two-story, street nar
rowing edifice?
With Washington street extended from Four
teenth street across Fifteenth to San Pablo
avenue, through an arcade where the City Hall
now Is, or as an ordinary street prolongation,
and in the near future, with Fifteenth street
crossing San Pablo avenue and rounding
, through similarly an arcade to Telegraph ave
nue and Broadway, what a picturesque vicin
ity will greet the sight-seeing stranger!
In a few months the San Pablo avenue cable
l ail way will be converted into an electric line,
and before two years it may be predicted that
same broad San Pablo avenue will be the pop
ular route to the ferry depot of the Santfp Fe.
Young men like Councilman Pringle see the
i merit of this proposition.
What if th,e twenty acres, three-fourths of
: the valuation of which was donated by the
Water Front Company through the efforts of
the Board of Trade, and situated on Twelfth
street, facing Lake Merrltt, be made suitable
and utilized for a site for the new City Hall?
It Is my Judgment, as It is that of. many of
: my fellow members of the Board of Trade, not
i to go further, that in the near future Oakland
! â or Alameda, as Oakland may some day be
calledâ will be a city comiirifilng within its
bounds every suburb now outlying.
We want to show a Chicago spirit In Oak
land. This town has now the wealth and popu
lation which, conjoined to the climate, topo
graphy and situation, make it a city of Import
i ance In the estimation of outsiders. Having a
beautiful and stately City Hall, a modern six
story block, with lake improvement, boulevard
and park, would surely be an advantage to
Oakland in numerous particulars. Would they
not hasten the desired city and county move
ment, and tend to draw toward us our neigh
bors of Alameda, Berkeley and Frultvale? And
the commercial interests of Oakland see a rapid
evolution for San Pablo avenue If a sumptuous
block â >{ buildings appear in place of the an
cient and petty structure now in service as a
Jail and City Hall.
Exposition Near Its Close.
OAKLAND, Nov. 7.â The State Exposi
tion is nearing its close, but interest and
attendance continue to increase. The pro
grammes and special days have proved a
success, and the management is endeavor
ing to make the final week the strongest of

complete charge of an excellent entertain
ment, including performances in athletics
such as wrestling, boxing, tumbling, etc.
To-morrow the A. O. U. W. will entertain

SOME VERY
CHEAP FIGHTS
WERE MADE
Generosity Is Shown
Politicians.
â 
COMPARISON *OF EXPENSES
FOUR- YEAR TERMS OBTAINED
ALL TOO EASILY.
Some Candidates Paid Nothing and
Just a Few Did Not Know
That They Were Nomi
v nated.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 29.
The time having elapsed in which can
didates at the recent election can legally
tile their expense accounts, It is instruc
tive to compare the various amounts
parted with in the wild scramble for office.
The evidence indicates that the printers,
"workers," "friends," livery stable men,
card peddlers, saloon men and restaurant
men in Alameda County are remarkably
generous. There must have been tens of
thousands of cigars, thousands of drinks,
hundreds of thousands of cards, hundreds
of workers and scores of buggies supplied
absolutely gratis to the candidates, for
they were not paid for. At least, if the
candidates have sworn to the truth, and
no Alameda politician or office holder has
ever been accused of doing otherwise,
no other conclusions can be arrived at.
than that generosity ruled their friends
Frank Jordan spent $712, which is the
highest of any candidate, in beating *.
C. Stoddard for County Clerk. It cost
Mr. Stoddard $401 for the glory.
Charley Spear, who ran for Recorder
spent $374, but it is some satisfaction to
him to know that it cost the successful
candidate, A. K. Grim, $tWI. Henry P.
Dalton had no opposition, being nomi
nated by every party. But some way or
other he spent $646. Coroner-elect Mehr
mann only spent $147, which is three more
than it cost James McManus to be de
feated. George L. Nusbaumer, the per
manent County Surveyor, put out $9S,
while his opponent, Mr. Guppy, spent but
Sl9 32.
John R. Glascock, who was considered
by the Fusionlsts a sure thing for Super
visor, parted with $1.82. whilo Will Church
spent but $2 50 more and was elected.
J. Aubrey Jones, who was in the Con
gressional race with Victor H. Metcalf,
paid $140 â¢ for the satisfaction of having
his name on the ballot. J. Smith, who
ran for Treasurer, spent 16 cents. H. B.
Lande made a campaign on $1 65. S. I).
Waterman spent $377 running for Super
intendent of Schools, while his successful
opponent, T. O.- Crawford, only let go of
$2SS. E. J. Grebs, who essayed to be
County Clerk, W. S. Chapman, an Assem
bly candidate, R. R. Burr for Assessor,
Michael Iverson for Coroner, I. M. Harri
son for Public Administrator and a few
other Prohibition candidates did not spend
a cent, while one or two candidates de
clared that they did not know they were
nominated or were on the ticket. And yet
it is freely said that many of the indi
vidual campaigns were not made on less
than $2000.
Tax Collector James B. Barber was pre
sented yesterday by his deputies with a
beautiful pearl-handled carving set. The
presentation was made at the annual din
ner given by the Tax Collector to his
deputies.
Most of the successful candidates have
already filed their bonds and the deputies
in the various departments are named as
printed in The Call some weeks ago.

INHUMAN ACT OF A FATHER.
Beats His Little Sons and Then
Causes Their Arrest.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 29.â Alameda is agi
tated to-night over the action of Jacob
Hoock, a member of the last Grand
Jury, who beat his sons, George and
John, aged respectively 11 and 13 years,
this afternoon until they were hardly
able to walk and then handed them over
to a police officer to have them locked up
in the City Prison. Â«.,Â»,,
The lad's were pupils at the Encinal
School. They live with their parents at
the corner of Railroad avenue and Ben
ton street. When they went home at
noon to-day they found their father in a
rage H<- " accused them of stealing a
bucket of paint and insisted that they
should tell all about it. The boys claim
ed they knew nothing about the stuff.
Failing to get a confession the father
picked up a heavy stick and beat the
boys most brutally. He then locked them
in "the house and kept them until evening
when he turned them over to Officer
T 'iiirt'iice and instructed him to lock
them up in the City Prison. No charge
has been placed against them.
The boys were put in a cell by them
selves to keep them apart from the hard
ened criminals in the jail. They were
seen this evening, and between sobs told
their story. They are both bright little
lads, and their faces show they were
truthful in what they said. They stated,
with considerable emphasis, that they
knew absolutely nothing about the stol
en paint. . - â  - â â '_.
"Papa whipped us awful hard, said
George the youngest of the pair, "and
we did not know what we were being
beaten for. He said we had stolen a
bucket of paint. Truly, we didn't and
don't know anything about it."
Indignation runs high at Hoecks ac
tion in having his sons locked in the jail
with drunks, petty larceniets and other
criminals. He Is a merchant of West
Alameda and was a member of tho
last Grand Jury. Hoeck claims that the
reason he had his boys locked up was to
scare them into making a confession.

A YOUNG WIFE'S DEATH.
Result of an Operation Performed
Last Week.
BERKELEY, Nov. 29.â Mrs. Maud
Fisher, the wife of Julius L. Fisher of
263] Shattuck avenue, died shortly after
midnight last light as the result of a
criminal operation performed in San
Francisco some time last week.
The deceased was scarcely 19 years of
age. She had been married about two
years. The husband is a barber by tradu.
His partner, A. Levy, occupies rooms
with his family in the rear of 'the store,
Mr. and Mrs. Fisher, with their one
child, residing elsewhere. Early Sunday
morning the woman came to her hus
band's store and complained of reeling
ill As her condition appeared to be
quite serious she was taken to one of
the rooms in the rear and Dr. t. K.
Woolsoy was summoned, but medical
aid failed to relieve her suffering.
By yesterday morning her recovery
seemed beyond hope, and Dr. G. B.
Hoagland was called in for consultation.
A.s death drew near she made a state
ment in the presence of both doctors
telling of the criminal operation to which
she had submitted. .
The act was done by some female doctor
in San Francisco some time during last
week. The unfortunate woman left Berke
ley one afternoon, all unknown to her
friends and relatives, to have the opera
tion performed.
Deputy Coroner Streightif was summon
ed as soon as death had taken place. He
ordered an autopsy to be conducted this
afternoon. The decision of the physicians
agreed substantially with the confession
made by the woman before her death.
After the result of the autopsy had been
made known Marshal R. F. Lloyd of
Berkeley left for San Francisco in search
of the person responsible for the criminal
act. It proved to be a woman by the name
(if Klizabeth Balkwell, living at 932 Harri
son street. Detectives Dillon, Crockett
and Marshal Lloyd placed her under ar
rest and took her to the City Prison,
where charges were entered against her.

Boys' Brigade Disrupted.
ALAMKDA, Nov. 29.â Company A of the
Boys' Brigade, the pioneer company of
the organization, has withdrawn from
the regimont with which it was connected
and has declared its independence. The
company is connected with the First
Presbyterian Church of this city, and it
was with the consent of the directors of
the church that the resignation was sent
to brigade headquarters. Trouble has
been brewing in the Boys' Brigade for
some time. It has not been a harmonious
body for several years, and the dissen
sions culminated in a smash-up a few
weeks ago, when several companies had a
competitive drill for a silver cup and the
affair broke up in a rough-and-tumble
light. The Presbyterian company re
sented what it claimed to be favoritism
on the part of the judges and withdrew
from the drill. Considerable ill-feeling
was demonstrated, and during the fight
that followed Company A was locked out
of its armory.
Oaklanders Finally Yield.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 29.â The Alameda City
Trustees will hold a special session to
morrow evening to take action toward
building- the Alameda approaches to the
Alice street bridge. The Oakland Mer
chants' Exchange notified the city au
thorities to-day that it had raised $300

lect and failure to provide.
Rogers Will Retire Monday.
ALAMKDA, Nov. 29.â City Marshal
Rogers stated this evening he would pre
sent his resignation to the City Trustees
next Monday night. The Trustees will
make no appointment to fill the vacancy.
Sergeant Conrad will assume control of
the police force as ranking officer. The
reason assigned for not naming a suc
cessor to Rogers is that the municipal
election will occur next April and that
an appointee would have an advantage
over the other aspirants for the office.
Plymouth Church Entertainment.
The congregation of the Plymouth Con
gregational Church has arranged an en
tertainment and sale of fancy articles, to
take place 'n the parlors of the edifice on

mothers and their little ones.
THE OAKLAND DOG SHOW.
High Class Collies and Cocker Span
iels Will Be Represented on
the Bench.
Great Interest has been aroused among
collie breeders by the novel feature to be ,
introduced in the forthcoming specialty j
show in Oakland, namely, the use of the I
score card in judging "that breed. Nor
man J. Stewart, the secretary of the Cali
fornia Collie Club, is responsible for the
Innovation, which will attract many en
tries. In fact, it is probable that the en
try of coliies will be a record one for the
coast. Mr. Stewart's kennels will be rep
reeented to its full strength. Mr. Albee of
Lawrence and Miss Beach of San Jose
will each send a strong contingent and (
Mr. Donnelly of Burllngame will exhibit
a couple of high-clasa dogs.
In cocker spaniels the entry will be a
representative one. It is said that Mr.
Wegener will throw the entire strength
of the Redwood kennels into the competi
tion, while Mr. Plum and Mr. Leonard
will show some blue-blooded cockers with
which they expect to gain their share or
the ribbons. . Â
But the Judging of the collies by the
score card will be the center of interest,
and too much credit cannot be assigned to
Mr. Stewart for his enterprise.
Phil Wand has sent his Eng.ish setter
bitch Flora W to Troy, N. V., to be bred
to E. A. Burdette's Cincinnatus Pride.
The Pacific Mastiff Club will meet on
Saturday next. The membership commit
tee will report on two candidates.
The Sacramento show will open on Jan
uary 4 and applications for premium lists
should be addressed to the secretary,
Matt Coffey, Sacramento. The chow will
be held under the rules of the Pacific
Kennel League, which can be obtained
from C. R. Harker, secretary, San Jose.
Wins will be recognized by every club,
a member of the league, and dogs having
won under the rules of the American
Kennel Club should be entered In the
corresponding class under the rules of the

WITTMAN HE
MUST RESIGN
The Chief and Captain
Open Hostilities.
LOUD WORDS AT SHORT RANGE
THE SUBORDINATE AVERS HE
WILL NOT STEP DOWN.
City Hall Corridors Ring With the
Racket, but Both Deny That
There Is Any Friction
Whatever.
War is on between Chief of Police Lees
and Captain George Wittmanâ war that
for a time last night threatened to lead
to an Immediate opening of hostilities,
and etill promises at no distant date to
result In the retirement from the police
force of one or the: Other of the com
batants. â¢V..V?
Both officers will', 'deny, when asked
si)out the affair to-day, that there has
been the slightest friction between them;
Captain George W. Wittman, Whom Chief Lees Has
Declared Must Resign.
that not one unfriendly -word has been ex
changed and that they entertain for each
other only feelings of esteem amounting
almost to brotherly love.
But those In the outer room of the
Chief's office and passing in the corridor
overheard the Chief fairly shriek
that he would force "YVittman to resign.
and the captain retort in equally high
pitched tones that nobody could compel
him to leave the force.
It was a torrid half hour for both, and
poor John Seymour, in the outer ofnce,
was in a frenzy of fear lest enough should
reach outside ears to reveal the secret
cause of the trouble. After a time the
angry voices became more subdued, and
when finally Captain Wittman left the
Chief's presence, florid of countenance and
still showing signs of the excitement he
had been laboring under, he did so with
an attempt at friendliness Intended to de
ceive the others, but bo forced as to be
painfully apparent.
The interview, or rather interviewsâ for
Wittman retired once and returned later
for the second round â lasted nearly two
hour 3. "Wittman had been in the Chiefs
room for some time when those outside
became aware from the steadily rising
tones that something unusual was going
on. The captain was evidently being
"ripped up..the back" in the Chief's most
artistic manner, and was striving to
escape the operation, but with nothing
like complete success.
Louder grew the voices until they rang
through the long corridor and even pene
trated to the reporters' room in the base
ment. The trouble was, apparently, in re
gard to Chinatown affairs, and the Chief
reviewed the matter as far back as the '
period when Wittman was a sergeant and
was tried by the Commissioners on â 
charges of having levied tribute on the
denizens of that district. The climax was
reached when Dees, in a voice that for

volume of sound would make his drum
corps sound like a spoon rattling in a
cocktail glass, bellowed:
"You'll have to resign! '
Wittman has a pair of lungs of his own
and he turned them wide open as he re-
plied:
"I won't resign; nobody can force me
to!"
"Yes, you will; I'll make you leave the
force!" Lees turned on still more steam
as he said this, but Wittman did not pen
his resignation then and there. Instead,
he reiterated the statement that he would
not yield to the Chief's demands.
Then the two voices became a confused
roar and nothing could be distinguished
until Wittman shouted out:
"Oh, that Chinatown affair is dead," al
luding to his own trial.
After a time the two calmed down and
the captain left the room, only to return
in a few minutes, but the voices did not
climb up to high "C" again, although they
talked long and at times exceedingly
earnest.
After Wittman retired to his own rooms
the Chief was questioned as to the cause
of the outbreak, but denied in the most
positive words that there was the slight
est friction between Wittman and himself.
"Do you mean to say. Chief, that you
have had no hard words with Captain
Wittman?"
"Most assuredly not. We were discuss
ing matters pertaining to the welfare of
the department, and I spoke rather em
phatically on some topics, as I sometimes
do, but as for having any words with Cap
tain Wittxnan, It's absurd."
"And you did not tell him that he would
be forced to resign from the depart
ment?"
"I said nothing of the kind. Wittman
and I have never had a word of trouble.
He is a good policeman and will remaan
on the force."
Captain Wittman was equally positive
that nothing in .the nature of a disagree
ment had taken place between himself
and Lees. He d'd say, however, that their
discussion had become quite heated and
that he had been objiged to talk loud to
make himself heard by the Chief. Ho
explained his refusal to resign by saying
he had told Lees that certain people were
trying to force him out, but he would not
resign and they could not make him, to
which the Chief replied: "That's right;
that's right." If this were all, it does
not seem to call for such shouting on the
part of both. Wittman further admitted
that the talk was on Chinatown matters,
and his own affair was included in it.
TREASURY DECISIONS
ON TOBACCO AND BEER
OF INTEREST TO THOSE WHO
HANDLE LEAF TOBACCO.
Brewers Exempt Where Beer Ij
Sold in Stamped Bar
rels.
The following decisions were sent to
Collector Jackson yesterday by the Sec
retary of the Treasury. They are of
considerable importance to merchants
and others in business.
Leaf tobacco taken from the original
package and moistened and pressed with
the stems In, or Jlrst stemmed and then
moistened and pressed, is regarded as a
manufactured tobacco and subject to tax
when sold or offered for sale and con
sumption in the United States; and the
person who prepares leaf tobacco
In this manner for sale and
I consumption in the United States
i would be regarded as a manufacturer of
tobacco, and all tobacco so manufac
tured, although intended expressly for
export, would be required to be exported
in bond from the place of manufacture.
i Leaf tobacco and manufactured pressed
; tobacco cannot lawfully be sold by
| a dealer in leaf tobacco without the pay
! ment of tax to consumers, or as supplies
. for vessels engaged in the coastwise
trade of the "United States.
Brewers are by express exempting
1 provision of the law entitled to sell their
! original kegs or barrels of beer to which
i the tax stamps are affixed without pay
! ing the special tax therefor as malt
I liquor dealers, and it matters not wheth-
I er these sales are made by themselves
or by their agents under them, nor at
how many places such sales are made.
Blackberry- juice preserved from spoil
ing by the addition of the necesary quan
tity of spirits is a medicinal article, and
i persons who sell it only under a label
; specifying the diseases for which it is
held out a.s a remedy, never knowingly
selling It to those who buy it for use as a
beverage, are not required to pay special
i tax aa liquor dealers on account of its
' sale.
A BIG DEFICIT.
Kilpatrick's Report Places the School
Board in a Bad Light.
The Grand Jury last evening continued
j its Investigation into School Board af
| fairs to the extent of hearing the first re
! port of its expert, Professor E. C Kil
j> patrick.
Professor Kilpatrlck's report does not
present the sunniest prospect possible ior
teachers and pupils during the coming
year. To begin with, the new board is
heir to an estimated deiicit of $300,000â
more than enough to run the entire school
system for three months. The actual de
ficit on October 30 was $262,000. and there
are unpaid bills on hand aggregating $76 -
000, which, under the one-twelfth act,
must be paid before the end of the year
or not at all. Professor Kilpatrick says
that this enormous deficit will probably
necessitate the closing of the schools dur
ing the coming year for three months at
least.
The case of F. Muller was also consid
ered. Muller was arrested some time ago
on a charge of robbery sworn to by one
Robinson. When his case came up Before
Judge Mogan he was released with nothing
in the way of a trial because of previous
good character. The evidence of two
police officers was heard but no action
taken. The School Board investigation
will be resumed this evening.

THE SAN FRANCSICO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1898.
NOT A BELLE NOR
A BEAU MISSING
Colonial Tea Scores a Magnificent Finan
cial and Social Success.
IF there was a single Tiolle or a soli
tary beau missing from the gay
throng at the Colonial tea yester
day afternoon or evening the un
fortunate one Is destined to remain
unknown, lost to those who make the
social history of the State, an exile
from the select multitude whose
names spell the exclusive blue book.
Everybody was there. Those who
follow Mr. Greenway trod upon the
toes of Mr. Salisbury's set, while in
between the crush were wedged many
who never attended a cotillon and only
glean their knowledge of the swell set
by reading the list of "those present."
Other affairs for a deserving cause
have been given, but never has every
body, irrespective of creed, opinion
and social position, responded so
unanimously to the call of a worthy
charity.
The Colonial tea was given for the
benefit of the California Girls' Train
ing Home, and the patronesses who
had the affair in charge are confident
that they have cleared considerably
over $2000. The various boothsâ each
and every one a thing of beauty boast
ing of some novel and altogether artis
tic arrangementâ did a thriving busi
ness. LÂ«ong before the closing hour
there was not a thing left on sale, save
a few boutonnieres, which the charm
ing flower girls with rare forethought
divided so as to make one bouquet
do service for several. Many a beau
went about with a bit of stalk or a
sprig of green pinned to the lapel of
his coat for which he gladly paid the
full value demanded for a complete
"buttonhole."

Qierken, who is employed at the Union
Iron Works, lives at 65 Stevenson street.
Several nights ago he met a friend named
Thomas Quirk, and they had numerous
drinks together. Gierken invited Quirk to
accompany him to his home, where they
engaged in a quarrel. Getting the worst
of the encounter, Quirk picked up a water
pitcher and struck Gierken on the head
with it, fracturing the skull.
Quirk was arrested immediately after
the trouble and was charged with an as
sault with a deadly weapon. Gierken was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where he
was detained, as it was believed that he
was fatally injured.
During the night he left the ward in
which he was confined and ran screaming
down the corridor. Steward Fogerty
seized him and induced him to return to
the ward. The following day he became
violently Insane and he was removed to
the insane department. The surgeons at
the hospital are convinced that Gierken's
condition is due to the blow he received
at the hands of Quirk. To-day he will be
taken before the Commissioners of In
sanity to be examined as to his mental
condition. Gierken imagines that an
enemy is pursuing him determined to take
his life. He constantly walks his cell,
vainly endeavoring to discover his im
aginary enemy and calling upon aim to I
bewildering bisque and sawdust beau
ties in gorgeous raiment, had but a
very brief though glorious existence.
Mr. Green of the "Little Johnnie"
mine, Colorado, bought up the entire
booth early In the day and presented
the contents to the Oriental beauties
of the Presbyterian Mission, who con
tributed so materially to the success
of the afternoon programme.
One of the gratifying though rather
unusual features of the affair was the
large number of gentlemen present.
Soldier and civilian elbowed one an
other in the vast multitude and went
down into the recesses of well-lined
pockets and plethoric purses oft and
many times and without coaxing or
pressing invitations. The girls at the
booths were so pretty, affable, well
gowned and altogether stunning that
the sterner sex could not help but buy,
and if "change" was now and then in
the press of business forgotten the ne
glect was instantly overlooked by the
hypnotized purchaser. The afternoon
and evening hours of the "tea" shared
equally in favor on the point of at
tendance. Both programmes were
equally attractive.
A delightful bit in the afternoon was
the recitations and songs of the Chi
nese girls and boys from the Presby
terian Mission. The little ones, ar
rayed in all the brilliancy of rich Ori
ental costume, waved the stars and
stripes and in childish treble piped the
"Battle Hymn of the Republic."
The programme of the afternoon in
full was as follows:
Recitation. Grace Whitney: vocal solos,
Mrs. l^ulu Snider, Miss Grace F. Morris,
Mrs. E. H. Pollner; songs and recitations
"come out and fight." Last evening he
became so violent that it was found neces
sary to strap him down.
Victims of the Walker.
" The body of Luigi Brizzolara, who was
killed in the explosion on the river
steamer T. C. Walker, was brought
down on the steamer Dauntless yester
day. The widow and relatives of the de
ceased were there to meet it. and after
the passengers had landed the remains
were taken to the family home on Pa
cific street.
The bodies of Chief Engineer Henry
and his wife came down on the morning
train from Stockton. They were taken
to Halstead & Co.'s undertaking parlors,
from where the funeral will take place
this morning.

neighbor's doorstep, but It is a meaner
one yet who will purloin an article of
such small monetary value as a morning
newspaper, yet J. C. Creswell of 3573
Eighteenth street stands convicted ol
two of these offenses and will receive his
sentence in Judge Mogan's courtroom
this morning.
The man was actually under arrest for
stealing milk as Officer J. J. Crowley
caught him coming off a step with the
bottle of lacteal fluid and a newspaper in
his hands. He at once arrested him and
charged him with stealing the milk.
When he was placed on the stand yester
day morning and asked what ho w : as do
ing on the doorstep he at once replied
that he had gone up there to take the
paper, and Judge Mogan at once con
cluded the case. This is the first time
that a man stealing a newspaper has
been convicted in the police courts of
this city and carriers are naturally re
joicing, as the custom has become so an
noying- ns to be a menace to business in
many instances.
As Creswell was apparently intoxica
ted when on the stand he was ordered to
appear this morning for sentence.

The retirin of the Tallant Banking
Company from business leaves a vacan

be filled by the owners of the Yokohama

conducted only a branch banking house,
but on January 1, 1899, they will begin
business upon the same lines as the
other banks of this city.

CREEGAN HAS
HOPES OF A
SHORT TERM
Why He Decided to
Confess.
TIRED OF THE JAIL LIFE
ACH SAYS HE HAD PLENTY OF
EVIDENCE.
The Police Believe That They Have
Finally Broken Up the
Famous Gang of
Forgers.
Whether or not Becker, the premier
forger of the world, is convicted on his
next trial for raising a Nevada Bank j
draft from $12 to $22,000, the Folice De- \
partment will congratulate itself on hay- i
ing broken up the most daring and skill- j
ful gang that ever mulcted the banks of j
two continents. Jimmy Creegan's con- 1
fession means the complete disruption of â 
the gang, even if they all go scot free. 1
Deane, the "business man," became j
frightened when he was arrested and I
seized the opportunity to turn State's \
evidence, hoping thereby to escape pun
ishment for his part of the felony. Then
McClusky followed Deane's lead and now
Creegan, the middle man, seeks mercy
from the Bankers' Association by also 1
turning against Becker, the principal In
the deal. Becker "squealed" on his part
ners on several occasions and now not j
one of the gang would trust another mem- I
ber If they were at liberty to continue |
their nefarious trade. Captain Seymour
says there has not been a professional j
bank forgery in this country since Becker j
and his gang were arrested.
Creegan admits having made a clean j
breast of the deal and gives as his excuse
tbat he is sick of remaining in jail. He
does not say that his betrayal of his pal ;
will insure his liberty or a lighter sen- ;
tence than he would otherwise have re- '
celved. It is evident he expected to be |
convicted and to obtain leniency he de- |
cided to confess, plead guilty at the next
trial and take his chances. Knowing the
bankers are particularly anxious to get
Becker out of the way he believes he and j
Deane will be given an opportunity to
reform.
Henry Ach, who is prosecuting the for
gers, says Creegan's confession was not
needed and that he will be prosecuted |
with Becker unless he withdraws his plea
of not guilty and acknowledges his crime.
The case was called in Judge Wallace a
court yesterday and at the request of the
defense the drawing of the jurors was
deferred until Thursday. A special venire
of 100 names was ordered drawn ami tne
case will proceed without further deiay.
When the case was called Becker was
alone at the bar and Judge Wallace asked
what had become of Creegan. the other |
prisoner. He was sitting back among the
spectators with Captain Seymour and on
the Judge's order come forward to the â¢
bar. He did not take his former seat be
side Becker and no look of recognition
passed between them.

Laura Tomas has been granted a
