WASHINGTON. Dec. When
Congress adjourned last July
the United States was at war
with Spain. General Shafter
was investing Santiago and
General Miles was preparing for his
campaign in Porto Rico.
Congress reassembled to-day under
entirely different conditions. Peace
has been attained and Congress finds
itself confronted with the necessity of
providing for the administration of
distant and widely different colonial
possessions and the increasing military
and naval strength of the country to
such measure as will give weight and
effect to the diplomacy of the United
> in the councils of nations.
There was nothing dramatic about
the opening scene in either house, and
except for the reading of the Presi
dent's message the proceedings were
devoid of interest. The galleries of
each chamber were crowded with
visitors.
For a short session the floral display
wm unusually large and beautiful.
Members of the House of Representa-
tives began to arrive at the Capitol
early, and an hour before the House
frnf-t the hall was thronged with Repre-
A entatives, and as many of the crowd
spectators as could get upon the
w-oor. There were hearty greetings be
tween members on both sides.
Speaker Reed entered the hall
promptly at noon, and the noise in the
chamber was instantly checked by the
fall of the Speaker's gavel, which sig-
nalized the beginning of the session.
The blind chaplain offered prayer, and
then the roll was called by States.
There were 267 responses and the
House was ready for business.
MOST BRILLIANT
ASSEMBLAGE IN THE
SENATE CHAMBER
In Addition to the Members There
Are Many Distinguished Diplo
mats to Witness the Open
ing Proceedings.
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.â "When the
Fenate convened to-day to begin the
closing session of the Fifty-ninth Con
gress the chamber presented a notable
and beautiful appearance. By 11
o'clock the public and private galleries
â were filled almost to their capacity
â¢with a distinguished assemblage, in
cluding many ladies in brilliant at
tire. On the floor of the Senate the
display of flowers was unusually beau
tiful, even for the opening day of a
session of Congress. The odor of flow
ers filled the chambers.
The memorable scenes enacted in
the chamber during the last session
and the momentous events that have
occurred since Congress last adjourn
ed created a feeling of intense expect
ancy on the part of both the specta
tors and the members of the Senate.
This was made manifest by the long
lines of people in the corridors anx
ious to gain admission into the gal
leries and by the early arrival of the
Senators on the floor.
Through the courtesy of the Vice
President the members of the Joint
High Commission were admitted to the
floor of the Senate, and were the re
cipients of much attention. Just be
fore the Senate was called to order
several well known members of the
diplomatic corps appeared in the diplo
matic gallery. Among them were Sir
Julian Pauncefote, Embassador of
Great Britain to the United States and
dean of the corps, with a party from
the British embassy; Mr. WB Ting
Fang, the Chinese Minister, and party,
and Mr. Ye Pum Chin, the Korean
Minister. All were interested specta
tors of the opening scenes of the ses
sion, and attentive listeners to the
reading of the President's message.
During a recess of three-quarters of
an hour, while the Senate was await
ing the presentation of the message
from the President the members of the
High Commission held an in
formal levee, greeting personally nearly
all of the members of the American
Senate.
The reading of the President's mes
sage, which occupied two hours and
â¢ .ehteen minutes, was received with
careful attention for an hour, but
after that the Senators drifted to the
cloak rooms or to the committee rooms,
â¢where they could peruse the message at
their leisure in the printed copies with
which they had been furnished.
Morgan of Alabama was the first
Senator to enter the Senate chamber,
and closely following him came the oc
toKenarlan, Mr. Morrill of "Vermont.

One by one the members dropped into
the chamber, and the floor soon pre
sented a scene as animated as that af
forded by the galleries.
Above, in the diplomatic gallery, just
before the Senate convened, appeared
Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British Em
bassador, and party, with Mr. Wu Ting
Fang, the Chinese Minister, and the at
taches of his legation and some other
members of the diplomatic corps. On
the floor appeared Lord Hereschel, the
chief representative of Great Britain on
the Joint High Commission, accom
panied by Jefferson Coolidge of Massa
chusetts. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir Rich
ard Cartwright, Sir Louis Davies and
Mr. Carlton, members of the commis
sion, were also on the floor.
Promptly on the stroke of 12 o'clock
Vice President Hobart entered, and, as
cending to his desk, rapped for order.
Rev. Mr. Milburn, the venerable blind
chaplain, in a profoundly impressive
manner, returned devout and reverent
thanks for "God's goodness to our na
tion and for his care of us since last
gathered in the chamber." â¢
"By thy good providence," the chap
lain prayed, "triumph has crowned our
arms by land and by sea and so that
peace has come to us through the
council chamber. Let thy grace be the
portion of our people, and may their
hearts be rendered in service to thee
and to all men. We pray that thy
blessing may be with the Queen Ite
gent of Spain and her young son and
on her nation. May thy heavenly
grace come to secure and uplift and
uphold that stricken people. Grant
that all good may be given to us, our
motherland and to all nations, and may
we walk hand in hand with our
brethren across the sea to the heights
of Christian civilization."
A call of the Senate developed the
presence of sixty-seven members. The
usual resolutions were offered and
adopted. Cullom of Illinois offered one
to appoint a committee to inform the
TRANSFER OF SUPREMACY
ON NEW YEAR'S DAY
Special Cable to The Call and The New York Herald. Copyright 1898, by James
HAVANA, Dec. 5. â It has been arranged that the formal transfer
of supremacy shall take place on New Year's day in the palace of the
Governor General. At the same instant the flag is raised there Amer
can flags will be raised on every fortification in the city. Officers in
the Postofflce and Custom-house are already preparing for the trans
fer of their private papers, which were boxed up and moved to-day.
When the hour for the change arrives the Americans will find every
thing ready, and the Government machinery will move along with
out the least friction.

notify the President that the Senate
was awaiting any communication he
might desire to make.
Morrill of Vermont and Cockrell of
Missouri were named by the Vice
President to join a like committee of
the House of Representatives to call
on the President.
McÃride of Oregon presented the cre
dentials of his newly elected colleague,
Simon, to whom the Vice President ad
ministered the oath of office.
Pending the receipt of the President's
message the Senate, on motion of Al
lison of lowa, took a recess of thirty
minutes.
At 1:25 p. m. the committee appoint
ed to wait upon the President reported
the performance of its duties and an
nounced that the President would im
mediately communicate with the Sen
ate in writing. Scarcely had the report
been read when Major Pruden, the
executive clerk of the President, en
tered the chamber and presented the
mess^e. Vice President Hobart laid
it before the Senate at once and its
reading was begun at 1:28 p. m.
The reading of the message occupied
two hours and eighteen minutes. Many
persons remained in the galleries
throughout the reading, but, as is
usual, little attention was given to the
presentation of the message, either in
the galleries or on the floor, after the
end of two pages. Many Senators who
had been provided with printed copies
of the message retired either to the
cloak rooms or to the committee rooms
to read the document at leisure. Not
the slightest demonstration occurred
during the reading of the messaee.

SPEAKER REED'S
GAVEL FALLS IN
HOUSE AT NOON
"WASHINGTON, Dec. s.â The open
ing session of Congress to-day was a
spectacular occasion, animated and
brilliant. There were more than the
usual number of distinguished person
ages in the thronged galleries, includ
ing many representatives of foreign
Governments, high officials and ladies
and gentlemen conspicuous in social
and political life. The greetings of
the members were most cordial, and
there was not an outcropping of par
tisan rancor to mar the occasion. One
of the most striking incidents was the
cordial meeting between the floor lead
ers of the respective sides, Dingley and
Bailey. In view of the gossip about
the possibility of Bailey being deposed
as the minority leader, it is significant
that the Speaker named Bailey as the
minority member of the committee to
wait upon the President, an honor al
ways bestowed upon the recognized
leader of the minority.
Speaker Reed received a warm wel
come from both sides of the House
when he ascended the rostrum to call
the House to order, but perhaps the
greatest personal ovation given to any
member was that accorded Major Gen
eral Wheeler of Alabama, who has not
been seen by many of his old colleagues
since he went to the front at the head
of the cavalry division of Shafter's
army. â¢
W. A. Stone of Pennsylvania, McMil
lin of Tennessee and Sayers of Texas,
who have been elected Governors of
their respective States since CongTess
adjourned, were also overwhelmed with
congratulations. The floral tributes to
day were unusually numerous, and
made the hall a veritable bower of
beautiful flowers. The proceedings
themselves were dull, all interest cen
tering in the reading of the President's
message. For over two hours the clerk
droned through the long document, but
the interest of members and spectators
never flagged. With rapt attention they
followed the President's recital of the
war and listened eagerly to every sug
gestion or recommendation he had to
offer. No expressions of approval or
disapproval interrupted the reading.
Exactly at noon Speaker Reed's gavel
came down with a sharp crack, the
great ebony mace entwined with silver
and surmounted with a silver eagle
was lifted into place on its marble
pedestal, the spreading folds of Ameri
can flags were broken to the breeze
about the brilliant stained glass ceil
ing and the House of Representatives
entered upon the closing session of the
memorable war Congress. The scene
within the great hall was animated,
brilliant and picturesque.
The sea of desks within the brass
rails which cut off the lobbies spreading
in semicircular lines from the Speak
er's rostrum like waves from a center
was a veritabl flower garden. A ma
jority of the members were in their
places, while the encircling galleries
were banked to the doors with people.
The assembling of a session of Congress
is always a great magnet for the multi

tude, but to-day the attraction was
fraught with the added interest of all
the memories which clung about the
War Congress, the triumphs and re
verses of the recent political battle at
the polls and the eagerness to hear the
President's message with its review of
the events which have crowded the
stage during this memorable year and
its recommendations of policies for the
future. The public seemed to feel that
this was to be c. i epoch-making ses
sion, and for hours before noon a steady
stream of people debouched from the
corridors into the galleries. Even the
private galleries were crowded an hour
before the hour for convening, and they
contained many people distinguished
in social and high official life. The dain
ty creations of the milliners' art and
brilliantly superb gowns gave color to
the picture.
The members began arriving shortly

before 11 o'clock, and the hall began
to buzz as they exchanged greetings,
congratulations or condolences. For
those who had gone down at the No
vember elections there were expres
sions of sympathy; for those who had
been victorious words of congratula
tion. Some of the members had regular
levees as they appeared. This was
markedly true of W. A. Stone of
Pennsylvania, Mr. Sayers of Texas and
McMillin of Tennessee, each of whom
was chosen Governor of his respective
State at the recent election. Here and
there throughout the throng was an
officer in full uniform, an unwonted
figure on the floor and a vivid reminder
of the war.

THE VICTIMS.
Charles D. Kennedy, Super
intendent.
Five Chinese employes.
A building lifted into the air and in
stantly torn to fragments, a cloud of
dust and smoke, a roar resembling
thunder, six human beings senÂ£ into
eternity â such in brief is the story of
an explosion at Flemmings Point last
evening.
Since the Government placed many
large contracts wi,th California powder
manufacturers, explosions are no
longer uncommon, but that of yester
day will be remembered longer than
many others. It robbed the community
of one of its most worthy men, one
whom Hon. W. W. Foote characterized
as "one of God's gentlemen." He was
Charles D. Kennedy, superintendent of
the works.
It was half-past 3 o'clock yesterday
afternoon when the gelatin plant of
the Judson Powder Works, near West
Berkeley, exploded.
The shock was terrific. It covered
an area of several miles, being felt in
San Francisco very distinctly, and
over the greater part of Contra Costa
and Alameda counties. The report
was heard for miles around. There
were six men killed â the superintend
ent and five Chinese.
The place where the explosion oc
curred is about two miles along the bay
shore from West Berkeley. It lies on
bleak, marshy land, several hundred
yards inland from Point Ysabel, and
Just north of McKeiths hill, in the re
gion of which most of the factories for
making explosives are located. It
stands at some little distance from the
railroad track, and a little over a mile
this side of Stege, in Contra Costa
County.
Nothing but a mass of ruins is left
to tell the tale of the catastrophe.
Every human being on the place wa3
killed instantly, so that nobody remains
who can give the slightest clew as to its
cause. For hundreds of yards around
lies scattered a huge mass of debris, in
which are mingled the remains of the
men who met their fate. Pieces of
boilers, copper vats and parts of ma
chinery, all twisted and turned into
every imaginable shape, and thrown
about in all possible directions, ttand
mute witnesses to the terrible force of
the upheaval.
As for the cause of the explosion
nothing can be advanced with certain
ty. The building in which the men are
known to have been at the fatal mo
ment contained a large vat of nitro
glycerin, surrounded by intricate ma
chinery. It was flanked on two sid^s
by mounds of earth, twelve feet
through at the base. A few feet away
stood the shed used for the manufac
ture of guncotton. The two buildings
were connected with machinery, and
the workmen were in the habit of pass
ing to and fro between them. Sur
rounding the vat of nitroglycertn was
a large tank of water for the purpose
of keeping the explosive at the right
temperature. It is suggested that the
water around the vat may have become
overheated before the workmen had
reason to suspect that the temperature
had risen. It is equally possible that
some part of the machinery may have
got out of order, in which case friction
would have developed sufficient heat to
put the explosives in danger. The lat
ter explanation seems the more prob
able, ' and was generally accepted by
experts viewing the scene of the ruins.
As in all other explosions the work
of destruction is so complete that the
only solution of its cause can be but
conjecture.
People who happened to be in the
vicinity of the plant at the moment of
destruction describe it as coming with
one great shock. They heard a thunder
ing report, and at the same instant the
whole of the gelatin building seemed to
be lifted high into the air, and imme
diately to be rent apart into thousands
of pieces and scattered to the four
winds. The two earthen mounds at the
flanks were blown down and their dust
mingled with the scattering fragments
of iron and wood. The guncotton shed
at the side became a total wreck. Every
board and plank was torn from its
place. The roof had been completely

$50,000,000 "for the national defense and for
each and every purpose connected there
with, to be expended at the discretion ct
the President.
That this act of provision oame none too
soon was disclosed when the application
of the fund was undertaken. Our forts
were practically undefended. Our navy
needed large provision for increased am
munition and supplies and even numbers
to cope with any sudden attack from the
navy of Spain, which comprised modern
vessels of the highest type of continental
perfection. Our army also required en
largement of men and munitions. The de
tails of the hurried preparation for the
dread contingency is told in the reports of
the Secretaries of War and of the Navy,
and need not be repeated here.
It is sufficient to say that the outbreak
of war, when it did come, found our na-
tion not unprepared to
meet the conflict. Nor
was the apprehension
of coming .strife con
lined to our own coun
try. It was felt by the

which, on April 6. through their Embus
sadors and Envoys, addressed to the ex
ecutive an expression of hope that hu
manity and moderation might mark the
course of this Government and people, and
that further negotiations â would lead to
an attempt which, while securing the
maintenance of peace, would affirm all
saary guarantees for the re-estab!lsh
ment of order in Cuba. In responding to
that presentation I also shared the hope
j that the Envoys had expressed that peace
i might be preserved in a manner to ter
' mlnate the chronic condition of disturb-
I mice in Cuba, so injurious and menacing
I to our interests and tranquillity, as well
i as shucking to our sentiments of humar.
i ity; and while appreciating the humani
! tartan and disinterested character of the
communication they had made on behalf
of the powers it stated the confidence of
i this Government on its part, that equal
â¢ appreciation would be shown for Its
| earnest and unselfish endeavors to fulfill
; a duty of humanity by ending a situation
the Indefinite prolongation of which had
become insufferable.
Still animated by the hope of a peaceful
j solution and obeying the dictates of duty
; no effort was related to bring about a
â  speedy ending of the Cuban struggle. Ne
gotiations to this effect continued active
i ly with the Government of Spain looking
jto the Immediate conclusion of a six
is' armistice in Cuba with a view to
effect the recognition of her people's
right to independence. Besides this, the
Ir.stant revocation of the order of recon
cftitration was asked so that the suffer
ing people might return to their
homes and, aided by united Amer
ican and Spanish effort, might be
put in a way to support themeslves, and
by orderly resumption of the well nigh de
stroyed productive energies of the island,

Uon of peace did not appear. If it was to
be by negotiation with the insurgents the
issue seemed to rest on the one side with
a body chosen by that faction of the elect
ors in the districts under Spanish control
and on the other with the insurgent popu
lation holding the interior country until
represented in the so-called parliament
and defiant at the suggestion of suing- for
peace.
Grieved and dfsappofzfted at t:us barren
outcome of my sincere endeavors to reach
a practicable solution I felt it mv duty to
remit the whole question to the Congress.
In the message of April v. 1898, I an
nounced that with this !ast overture in
the direction of Immediate peace in Cuba
and its disappointing reception by Spain
the .'ffort of the executive was brought to
an end. I again reviewed the alternative
course of action which I had prepared,
concluding that the only course consonant
with international policy and compatible
with our firmest historical tracutions. was
intervention as a neutral to stop the war
and check the hopeless sacrifice of life
even though that resort involved "hostile
constraint upon both the parties to the
contest, as well as to enforce a truce so
as to give time for the eventual settle
ment."
Th* grounds justifying that step were
thÂ«Â» interests of humanity; the duty to
protect life and property of our cousins
In Cuba; the right to protect our com
merce, and. most important, the need of
removing at once and forever the con
stant menace and the burdens entailed
upon our government by the uncertainties
and perils of the situation caused by the
unendurable disturbance in Cuba. I said
"The long trial has proved that the ob
ject for which Spain has waged the war
cannot be attained. The lire of insurrec
tion may flame or may smoldfr with
varying seasons, but it has not been and
it is plain it cannot be extinguished by

nine days of earnest deliberation, during
which the almost unanimous sentiment of
your body was developed on every point
pave as to the expediency of coupling tho
prepared action with a formal recognition
of the republic of Cuba as the true and
lawful government of that Island â a prop
osition which failed of adontionâCon
gress, after conference, on the lftth of
April, by a vote of 42 to 35 In the Senate
and Ml 1 to 6 in the House of Representa
tives, passed the memorable joint resolu
tion, saying:
Firstâ That the people of the Island of
Cuba are, and by right ought to be, free
and Independent.
Second-That It Is the duty of the United
States and the Government of the United
States hereby demands that the Govern
ment of Spain at once relinquish its au
thority in the island of Cuba and with
draw !â¦? land and naval forces from Cuba
and Cuban waters.
Thirdâ That the PreFldent of the United
States be and Is hereby directed and
empowered to use the entire land and
naval forces of the United States,
and tho militia of the several
States, to such extent as may be neces
sary to carry these resolutions Into effect.
Fourthâ That the United States hereby
disclaims any disposition or intention to
exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or con
trol over said island, except for the pacifi
cation thereof, and asserts Its determina
tion that when that is accomplished to
leave the government and control of the
island to its people.
This resolution was approved by the
Executive on April 20. A copy was at

coupling this demapd with announce
ments of the intentions of this Govern-
I merit as to the future of the island, in
! conformity with the fourth clause of the
I resolution and giving Spain until noon of
April 23 to reply.
The demand, although, as above shown,
officially made known to the Spanish en
voy here, was not delivered at Madrid.
After the instructions reached General
Woodford, on the morning of April 21, but
before he could present it, the Spanish
Minister of State notified him that upon
the President's approval of the joint reso
lution the Madrid Government, regarding
the act as "equivalent to an evident dec
laration of war," had ordered its Minister
lln Washington to withdraw, thereby
breaking off diplomatic relations between
the two countries and ceasing all official
communication- between their respecltve
countries.
General Woodford thereupon demanded
his passports and quitted Madrid the
same day.

of the United States and initiated that

of Cuba, including ports on said coast be

Cuba; and on the 23d I called for volun

By my message of April 25 Congress was
informed of the situation and I recom

I'nited States and Spain. The Congress
accordingly voted on the same day the
act approved April 25, 189 s !, declaring the
existence of such war from and includ
ing April 21, and enacted the approval of
the resolution of April 21, directing the
President to use all the armed force of
the nation to carry that act into effect.
Due notification of the existence of war
as aforesaid was given April 25 by tele- j

war, in point of date, took place April Â°7
when a detachment of the blockading
squadron made a reeonnoissance in force
at Matanzas, shelled the harbor forts
! and demolished several new works in con
struction.

mark a memorable epoch In maritime

beingelven, It repaired to Mirs Hay. near

Philippine Islands under telegraph'c I
orders to capture or destroy the
formidable Spanish fleet then as
sembled at Manila. At daybreak
on the Ist of May. the American
force entered Manila Ray and after a few
hours' engagement effected the total de
struction of the Spanish fleet, consisting
of ten warships and a transport; besides
capturinK the naval station and the forts
at Cavite, thus annihilating the Spanish
naval power In the Pacific Ocean and
cnmplotelv controlling the bay of Manila !
with the ability to take the city at will.
Not a life was lost on our ships, the ;
wounded only numbering seven, while not
ii vr-.epcl was materially injured. For this
pallanv achievement Congress, upon
my recommendation, fitly bestowed upon
the actors preferment and substantial re
ward.
The effect of this remarkable victory
upon th" spirit of our people and upon the
fortunes nf war was Instant. A prestige
of invincibility thereby attached to our
arms, which continued throughout the
struggle. Reinforcements were. hurried
to Manila, under the command nf Major
General Merrltt, and firmly established
within sight of the capital, which lay
helpless before our guns. On the 7th day
of May the Government was advised of
ficially of the victory at Manila, and at
once Inquired of the commander of our
fleet what troops were required. The in
formation was received on the 13th day
of May, and the first army expedition
sailed May i!J and arrived at Manila June
80. Other expeditions soon followed, the
total force consisting of 641 officers and
15,058 men.
Only reluctance to cause needless loss
of life and property prevented the early
storming and capture of
the city, and therewith

truce of December, 1897. Their forces In
vested Manila from the northern and
eastern side, .but were constrained by
Admiral Dewey and General Morritt from
attempting an assault. It was lining that
wnatever. was to be done in the â  wav of
decisive operations In that quarter should
be .'iccomi)')Â£hed by the strong arm of the
United States alone. Obeying the stern
precept of war, which enjoins the over
coming of the adversary and the extinc
tion of his power wherever assailable as
the speedy and sure means to win a
peace, divided victory was not permis
sible, for no partition of i the rights and
responsibilities attending the enforcement
of a just and, advantageous peace could be
thought of. â¢ -. . :â :â â 
, Following the comprehensive scheme, of
general attack, powerful forces were as
sembled at various points on our coast to
invade Cuba and Porto Rico. Meanwhile
naval demonstrations were made at sev
eral exposed points. On May 11 the cruiser
Wilmington and the torpedo-boat Wins
low were unsuccessful in an attempt to
silence the batteries at Cardenas Worth
Bagley and four seamen falling These
grievous fatalities were, strangely enough
among the very few which occurred dur
ing our : naval operations in this extraor
dinary conflict. Â' .

vera, which had assembled at the Can*
Verde Islands before the outbreak of hoi

baffling the pursuit of our fleets. For a
time fears were felt lest the Oregon and

long voyage from San Francisco ; of over
10.000 miles, might be surprised by Admiral '
Cervera's fleet, but their fortunate arrival !
dispelled the apprehensions and lent much

; coast of Cuba and Porto Rico in perpara

Shore batteries, escaping with their lives
a* by a miracle, but falling Into the
hands of the Spaniards. It Is a most grat
ifying incident of the war that the bra
very of this little band of heroes was cor
! dially appreciated by the Spaniards, who
â  sent a flag of truce to notify Admiral
', Sampson of their safety and to compli
ment them upon their daring act. They
i were subsequently exchanged July 7.
By June 7 the cutting of the last Cuban
rable Isolated the Island. Thereafter .the
i Invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On
June 10. under a heavy protecting fire, a
landing force of (W marines from the Ore
gon. Marblf-head and Yankee was effect
ed on Guantanamo Bay. where It had been
determined to establish a naval station.
: This Important and essential port was
taken from the enemy after severe fight
ing by the marines, who were the first or
ganized force of the United States to land
in Cuba.
The position fo won was held despite
the desperate attempts to dislodge our
â  forces. By June 16 additional forces were
landed and strongly intrenched. On June
'22 the advance of the invading army
' under Major General Shafter landed at
Hatquirl. about 15 miles east of Santiago.
I This' was accomplished under great diffi
j cultfes, but with marvelous dispatch. On
i June 23 the movement against Santiago
; was begun. On the 2-lth the first serious
1 engagement took "place, in which the
! First and Tenth Cavalry and the First
I Volunteer Cavalry, General Young's
brigade of General Wheeler's division,
participated, losing heavily. By night

battle took place, our forces gaining the
outer works of Santiago, and E! Caney
and Sail juan were taken after a desper
ate charge, and the investment of the city
was completed. The navy co-operated by
shelling the town and the coast forts.
On the day following this brilliant
achievement of our land forces, July 2.

The Spanish admiral and over 1300 men
were taken prisoners, while the enemy's
Los* of Ufa was deplorably large, some six
hundred perishing. On our side but one
man was killed and one man seriously
wound, d. Although our ships were re
peatedly struck, not one was seriously
injured. Whore all so conspicuously dis
tinguished themselves, from the com
manders to the gunners, and the unnamed
heroes In the boiler rooms, each and all
contributing toward the achievement of
this astounding victory, for which neither

the marvelous disproportion of casualties,

the achievements of our builders, mechan

With the catastrophe or Santiago
Spain's effort upon the ocean virtually
ceased.
A spasmodic effort toward the end of
June to send her Mediterranean fleet un
der Admiral Camara to relieve Manila
was abandoned, the expedition being re
called after it had passed through the
Suez Canal. The capitulation of Santiago
followed. The city was closely besieged
by land, while the entrance of our ships
Into the harbor cut off all relief on that
side. After a truce to allow of the re
moval of the non-combatants protracted
negotiations continued from July 3 until
July 15, when under menace of immediate
assault, the preliminaries of surrender
were agreed upon.
On the 17th General Shafter occupied the
city. The capitulation embraced the en

To those who grained this complete triumph

United States on land, as the fight oft
Santiago had fixed our supremacy on the

the nation is unsparingly due. Nor should

any exultation with the result and teach
us to weigh the awful cost of war, how
ever rightful the cause or signal the vic
tory.
With the fall of Santiago the occupation
of Porto Rico became the next strategic
necessity. General Miles had previously
been assigned to organize an expedition
for that purpose. Fortunately, he was al
ready at Santiago, where he had arrived
on the llth of July with reinforcements
for General Shaffer's army.
With these troops, consisting of 3415 in
fantry and artillery, two companies of
engineers and one company of the signal
corps, General Miles left Guantanamo on
July 21, having nine transports convoyed
by the fleet under Captain Higginson, with
the Massachusetts (flagship), Dixie Glou

no serious resistance. The campaign was I
prosecuted with great vigor and by the
12th of August much of the Island
was In our possession and the acqui
sition of the remainder was only a matter !
of a snort time. At most of the points in
the island our troops were enthusiasti

to the flag and gratitude for delivery from ;
Spanish rule met our commanders at ev

peace the outcome of the Porto Rican ex

generous commendations are due to those
who participated In it.

Last Scene
of War
at Manila.-
The casualties were
comparatively few. By this conquest of
the Philippine Islands, virtually accom
plished when the Spanish capacity for
resistance was destroyed by Admiral
Dewey, his victory of the Ist o. May was
formally sealed. To General Merritt, his
officers and men, for the uncomplaining
and devoted services, for their gallantry
in action, the nation Is sincerely grate
ful. The long voyage was made with sin
gular success, and the soldierly conduct
of the men, of whom many were without
previous experience in the military ser
vice, deserves unmeasured praise.
Ihe total casualties in killed .and
wounded in the army during the war was
as follows: Officers killed, 23; enlisted
men killed, 257; total, 280; officers wound
ed 113; enlisted men wounded,l464; total.
1.V77. Of the navy, killed 17, wounded ffT;
died as result of wounds, 1; invalided
from service. 6; total, 91.
It will be observed that while our navy
was engaged in two great battles and in
numerous perilous undertakings in the
blockades and bombardments, and more
than GO,OOO of our troops were transported
to distant lands and engaged in assault
and siege and battle and many skirm
ishes in unfamiliar territory, we lost in
both arms of the service a total of 166S
killed and wounded, and in the entire
campaign by land and sea we did not lose
a gun, or a flag, or a transport, or a ship,
and with the exception of the crew of the
Merrimac not a soldier or sailor was tak
en prisoner.
On August 7, forty-six days from the
date of landing of General Shafter's army
in Cuba and twenty-one days from the
surrender of Santiago, the United States
troops commenced embarkation for home.
ana our entire force was returned to the
I'r.ited States as early as August 24. They
were absent from the United States only
two months.
It Is fitting that I should bear testimony
to the patriotism and devotion of that

army which, although

I have the biggest stock of such goods in town, what is the use paying to

than to be taught. It is a well-known fact that we carry the best and
cheapest and most desirable stock of Christmas things to be found any

I the war. On the 26th of July M. Cambon
presented a communication signed by the
Duke of Almodovar. the Spanish Minister
of State, inviting the United States to
state the terms upon which it would b^
willing to make peace. On July 30, by a
communication addressed to the Duke of
Almodovar and handed by M. .Gambon,
the terms of this Government were an
nounced, substantially in the protocol
afterward signed. On Au.srust 10 the
Spanish reply, dated August 7, was hand
ed by M. Cambon to the Secretary of
State. It accepted unconditionally" the
terms imposed as to Cuba. Porto Rico
and an island of the Ladrone group, but
appeared to seek to introduce inad
missible reservations in regard to our de
mand as to the Philippines. Conceiving
that discussion on this point could neither
be practicable nor profitable I directed that
in order to avoid misunderstanding the
matter should be foi...with closed by pro
posing the embodiment in a formal pro
tocol of the terms in which the negotia
tions for peace were to be undertaken.
The vague and inexplicit suggestions of
the Spanish note could not be accepted,
the only reply being to present as a vir
tual ultimatum a draft of th-e protocol,
embodying the precise terms tendered to
Spain in our note of July 30, with adri^d
stipulations of detail as to the appoint
ment of -commissioners to arrange for the
evacuation of the Spanish Antilles. On
August 12 M. Cambon announced his re
ceipt of full powers to sign the protocol
as submitted. Accordingly, on the after
noon of August 12 M. Cambon. as the
plenipotentiary of Spain, and the Secre
tary of State, as the plenipotentiary of
the United States, signed the protocol,
providing:
"Article Iâ Spain will relinquish all
claim of sovereignty over and title to
Cuba.
"Article 3â Spain will cede to the United
States the island of Porto Rico and other
islands now under Spanish sovereignty in
the West Indies, and also an island in tho
Ladrones to be selected by the United
States.
"Article 3â The United States will oc
cupy and hold the city, bay and harbor
of Manila pending the conclusion of a
treaty of peace which shall determine the
control, disposition and government of the
Philippines."
The fourtti article provided for the ap
pointment of joint commissions on .the
part of the United States and Spain to
meet In Havana and San Juan, respect
ively, for the purpose of arranging and
earrving out the details of the stipulated
evacuation of Cuba, Porto Rico and other
Spanish islands in the West Indies.
The fifth article provided for the ap
pointment of not more than five com
missioners on each side, to meet at Paris
not later than October 1, and to proceed
to the negotiations and conclusions of a
treaty of peace, subject to ratification
according to the respective constitutional
forms of the two countries.
The sixth and last article provided that
upon the signature of the protocol hos
tilities between the two countries should
be suspended and that notice to that ef
fect should be given as soon as possible
by each Government to the commanders
of Its military and naval forces.
Immediately upon the conclusion of the
protocol I issued a proclamation of Au-
tilitlea on the part of
the United States. The
necessary orders to that
end were at once given
by telegraph. The

Cuba and San Juan de Porto Rico was in
like manner raised. On August 18 the
muster out of 100,000 volunteers, or as ne< -
that number as was found to be prac
ticable, was ordered.
On December 1 101,655 officers and men
had been mustered out and discharged
from the service. Nine thousand and two
more will be mustered out by the 10th of
the month. Also a corresponding number
of generals and general staff officers have
been honorably discharged from the
service.
The military committees to superintend
the evacuation of Cuba, Porto Rico and
the adjacent islands were forthwith ap
pointed: -
For Cubaâ Major General James F.
Wade, Rear Admiral William T. Sampson,
Major General Matthew C. Butler. f
For Porto Ricoâ Major General John C%
Brooke. Rear Admiral Winfield S. Schlaf
Brigadier General W. Gordon, who sol
afterward met the Spanish commissioned
at Havana and San Juan, respectively.
The Porto Rlcan joint commission
speedily accomplished its? task, and by Oc
tober 18 the evacuation of the island was
completed. The United States flag was
raised over the island at noon that day.
The administration of Its affairs has
been provisionally intrusted to a Military
Governor until Congress shall other
wise provide. The Cuban Joint High Com
mission has not vet terminated its labors.
Owing to the difficulties in the way of re
moving the large numbers of Spanish
troops still in Cuba the evacuation cannot
be completed before the Ist of January
next.
Pursuant to the fifth article of the pro
tocol, I appointed William R. Day, lately
Secretary of State; Cushman K. Davis,
William Frye and George Gray, Senators
of the United States, and Whitelaw Reid
to be the peace commissioners on the
part of the United States. Proceeding in
due season to Paris, they there met on
the Ist of October five commissioners
similarly appointed on the part of Spain.
The negotiations have made hopeful prog
ress, so that I trust soon to be able to
lay a definite treaty of peace bofore the
Senate, with a review of the steps leading
to its signature.

As soon as we are in possession of Cu

necessary to give aid and direction to this

selves. This should be undertaken at the
earliest moment consistent with safety
and assured success. It is important that

commercial relations close and reciprocal.
It should be our duty to assist in every
proper way to build up the waste places
of the island, encourage the industry of
the people and assist them to form a
government which shall be free and in

Consuls coming here under its authority,
that recognition was qualified by the dis
tinct understanding that the responsibility
of each of the component sovereign repub
lics toward the United States remained
wholly unaffected.
This provision was needful, inasmuch
as the compact of the three republics was
at the outset an association whereby cer
tain representative functions were dele
gated to a tripartite commission, rather
than a federation possessing centralized
powers of government and adminis
tration. In this view of the relation
1 of the United . States to the several re
publics, a change in the representation of
this country in Central America, was
neither recommended by the executive or
initiated by Congress, thus leaving one of
I our Envoys accredited as heretofore sep
arately to two States of the Greater Re
public, Nicaragua and Salvador, and to a
third State, Costa Rica, which was not
a party to the compact, while our other
Envoy was similarly accredited to the
union State of Honduras and the non
union State of Guatemala. The result has
been that the one presented credentials
only to the President of Costa Rica, the
other having been received only by the
Government of Guatemala.
Subsequently the three associated re
publics entered into negotiations for mak
i ing the steps forecast in the original com
pact. A convention of their delegates
iramed for them a federal constitution
under the name of the United States of
Central America and provided for a cen

the importance of giving appreciation of
the importance of giving a speedy and
practical outcome tO the project that has
lor so many years engrossed the attention
ot the respective countries.
As the scope of recent inquiry embraced
the whole subject, with the aim of mak
ing plans and surveys for a canal by the
must convenient route, it necessarily in
cluded a review of the results of previous
surveys and plans, and in Particular those
adopted by tile Maritime ("anal Company!
under its existing concessions from Nica
ragua and Costa Rica, so that to this ex
tent these grants necessarily held an es
sential part in the deliberations and con
clusions of the Canal Commission as they
have held and must needs hold in the
discussion of the matter by Congress Un
der these circumstances and in view of
overtures made to the governments of
Nicaragua and Costa Rica by other par
ties for a new canal concession predicated
on the assumed approaching lapse of the
contracts of the Maritime Canal Company
with those states, I have not hesitated
to express my convictions that considera- !
tions of expediency and international
policy, as between the several govern
ments interested in the construction and ;
control of an interoceanic canal by tnia ;
route require the maintenance of the !
status quo until the Canal Commission I
shall have reported and the United States
Congress shall have had the opportunity I
to pass finally upon the wh.'lo matter dur
ing the present session without prejudice !
by reason of any change in the existing
conditions.
Nevertheless, it appears that the gov
ernment of Nicaragua, as one of its last
sovereign acts before merging its lowers
in those of the newly formed United
States of Central America, has granted
an optional concession to another asso
ciation to become effective on the expira
tion of the present grant. It does not ap
pear what surveys have been made or
what route is- proposed -under this con
tingent grant, so â¢ that an examination
of the feasibility of its plans is necessarily
not embraced in the report of the Canal
Commission. All these circumstances sug
gest the urgency of some definite action
by Congress at this session if the labors
of the past are to be utilized and the -link
ing of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by
a practical waterway is to be realized. â¢
That the construction of such a maritime â¢
highway is now more' than ever indis
pensable to that intimate and ready inter
communication between our eastern and
western seaboards demanded by the an
nexation of the Hawaiian Islands and
the prospective expansion of our inilunece
and commerce to the Pacific, and that our
national policy now more imperatively
than ever calls for its control by this
Government, are propositions which I
doubt not Congress will duly appreciate
and wisely act upon.

deavoring to bring about with the friendly
concurrence of the Chilean Government.

pean powers; but the
prospect that the vast commerce which the
energy of our citizens and the necessity
of our staple productions for Chinese uses
lias built up in those regions may not be
prejudiced through any exclusive treat
ment by the new occupants has obviated
the need of our country becoming an act
or in the scene.
Our position among nations having a
large Pacific coast, and a constantly ex
panding direct trade with the farther
Orient, gives us an equitable claim to
consideration and friendly treatment in
this regard and it will be my aim to sub
serve our large interests In that quarter
by all means appropriate to the constant
policy of our Government. The territo
ries of Kiaochau, of Wei-Hal-Wei and of
Port Arthur and Talian Wan, leased to
Germany, Great Britain and Russia re
spectively for terms of years, will, it is
announced, add to international com
merce during such occupation; and if no
discriminating treatment of American
citizens and their trade be found to exist
or be hereafter developed, the desire of
this Government would appear to be real
ised. In this relation, as showing the vol
ume and value of our exchanges with
China and the peculiarly favorable condi
tions which exist for their expansion in
the normal course of trade, I reter to the
communication addressed to the Speaker
of the House o.f Representatives by the
Secretary of the Treasury on the 14th of

soon afterward rendered It necessary for
another to take up and complete his un
| finished work, and on January 11 last Mr.
! Thomas W. Crldler, Third Assistant Sec-
I retary of State, was designated to fulfill
that task. His report was laid before you
i by my message of June 14, 1898, with the
gratifying result of awakening renewed
! interest in the projected display. By a
provision in the sundry civil appropria
tion act of July 1. 1898, a sum not to ex
ceed $650,000 was allotted for the organiza
tion of a commission to care for the
i proper preparation and installation of
I American exhibits and for the display of
I suitable exhibits by the several executive
! departments, particularly by the Depart
ment of Agriculture, the Fish Commission
and the Smithsonian Institution, in the
representation of the Government of the
United States. Pursuant of that enact
ment, I appointed Mr. Ferdinand W. Peck
of Chicago Commissioner General, with
an assistant Commissioner General and
secretary. Mr. Peck â¢at once proceeded
"to Paris, where his success in enlarging
the scope and variety of the United States
exhibit has oeen most gratifying. Not
withstanding the comparatively limited
area of the exposition siteâ than one
half that of the World's Fair at Chicagoâ
the space assigned to the United States
has been increased from the absolute al
lotment of 157,403 square feet reported by
Mr Handy to some 202,000 square feet,
with corresponding augmentation of the
field for a truly characteristic represen
tation of the important branches of our
country's development. Mr. Peck re
port will be laid before you. In my judg
ment its recommendations will call for
your ' early consideration, especially as
regards an Increase of the appropriation
to at least one million dollars in all, so
that not only may the assigned space be
fully taken up by the best possible ex
hibit In every class, but the preparation
I and installation be on so perfect a scale
as to rank among the first tin that un
paralleled competition of artistic and in
ventive production, and thus counterbal
ance the i. disadvantage with which we
start, as - compared with other countries
whose appropriations are on a more gen
erous scale and whose preparations are
in a state , of much greater forwardness
than our own.

I transmitted to the Senate on February
10 last information touching the prohibi
tion against the importation of fresh
fruits from this country, which had been
recently decreed by Germany, on the
ground of danger of disseminating the
Ban Jose scale insect. This precaution
ary measure was justified by Germany on
the score of the drastic steps taken in
several States of the Union against the
spread of the pest, and the great
danger to German fruit growing in
terests should the scale obtain a
lodgment in that country. Temporary re
liel was afforded In the case of large con

was relaxed su as to apply only to un

be expected, the alarm reached to other
countries and Switzerland has adopted a
similar inhibition. Efforts are in progress
to induce the German and Swiss Govern
ments to relax the prohibition in favor of
dried fruits shown to have been cured

In the early part of April last, pursuant

the St. Lawrence River. The vessels had
reached Lake Ontario and were there
awaiting the opening of navigation when

The interpretation of certain provisions
of the extradition convention of December

of controversy with the
Government of Mexico.
An acute difference

rera, who, having led a marauding expedi
tion near the border with the proclaimed
purpose of initiating insurrection against
President Diaz, escaped into the United
States. Extradition was refused on the
ground that the alleged offense was politi
cal in its character and therefore came
within the treaty proviso of non-surren
der. The Mexican contention was that the
exception only related to purely political
offenses and that as truerrera's acts were
admixed with the common crime of mur
der, arson, kidnaping and robbery, the
option of non-delivery became void, a
position which this Government was un
able to admit, in view of the received in
ternational doctrine and practice In the
matter. The Mexican Government, in
view of this, gave notice on January 24
1898, of the termination of the convention
to take effect twelve months from that
date, at the same time inviting the con
clusion of a convention toward which ne
gotiations are on foot.
Toward this relation I may refer to the
necessity of some amendment of our ex
isting extradition statute. It is a com
mon stipulation of such treaties that
neither party shall be bound to give up
its own citizens with the added proviso
in one of our treaties, that with Japan
that it may surrender if it see fit. It is
held in this country by an almost uni
form course of decisions that where a
treaty negatives the obligation to surren
der the President is not invested with le
gal authority to act. The confirming of
such authority would be in the line of that
sound mortality which shrinks from afford
ing secure asylum to the author of a
heinous crime. Again, statutory provi
sion might be well made for what is
styled extradition by way of transit,
whereby a fugitive, surrendered by onÂ«
foreign Government to another, may be
conveyed across the territory of tha
United States to the Jurisdiction of the
demanding State. A recommendation in
this behalf, made in the President's mes
sage of 1896, was not acted upon. The
matter is presented for your considera
tion.
The problem of the Mexican free zone
has been often discussed with regard to
its inconvenience as a provocative of
smuggling into the United States along an
extensive and thinly guarded land bor
der. The effort made by the joint reso
lution of March 1. 1895. to remedy the
abuse charged by suspending the privilege
of free transportation in bond across the
territory of the United States to Mexico
failed of good result, as is stated in re
port No. 702 of the House of Representa
tives submitted in the last session,
March 11, IS9S. As the question is one to
be conveniently met by wise concurrent
legislation of the two countries looking to
the protection of the revenues by harmon
ious measures operating equally on either
side of the boundary, rather than by con
ventional arrangements. I suggest that
Congress consider the advisability of au
thorizing and inviting a conference of rep
resentatives of the Treasury Denartments
of the United States and Mexico to con
sider the subject in all its complex bear
ings and make report, with nertinent rec
ommendations, to the respective govern
ments for the information and the con
siderations of their Congresses.

Immediately upon the outbreak of the
war with Spain, the Swiss Government,
fulfilling the high mission it has deserv
edly assumed as the patron of the Inter
national Red Cross, proposed to the
United States and Spain that they should
severally recognize and carry into exe
cution as a modus Vivendi during the con
tinuance of hostilities the additional arti
cles proposed by the International Con
ference at Geneva October 26, 1868, ex
tending the effects of the existing Red
Cross Convention of 1864 to tho conduct of
naval war. Folowing the example set by
France and Germany in 1870, in adopting
such a modus Vivendi, and in view of the
accession of the United States to those
additional articles in 1882. although tho
exchange of ratification thereof still re
mained unaffected, the Swiss proposal
was cordially accepted by us and simul
taneously by Spain.
This Government feels a keen satisfac
tion in having thus been enabled to tes
tify its adherence to the broadest prin
ciples of humanity even amidst the clash
of war, and it is to be hoped that the ex
tension of the lied Cross compact to hos
tilities by sea as well as on land may
soon become an accomplished fact

I have the satisfaction of being able

more efficient instrument of the wise pur

cordial support of the contributing mem
bers of the international union whiich are
actually represented in its board of man
agement. A commercial directory in two
volumes, containing a mass of statistical
matter descriptive of the industrial and
commercial interest of the various coun
tries, has been printed in English. Span
ish, Portuguese and German, and a
monthly bulletin, published in these four
languages and distributed in the Latin-
American counfi'-s as well as in the
United States, has proved to be a valu
able medium for disseminating informa

the International union.
During the past year the important
work of collecting information of practical
benefit to American industries and trade
through tin- apcncy of diplomatic and con

and in order to lay such data before the
public with the least delay the practice
was begun in January. 1898, of issuing the
commercial reports from day to day as
they are received by the Department of

as well as fullness of information, the
service thus supplied to our merchants
and manufacturers will be found to show
sensible improvement and to merit the
liberal support of Congress.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Some people in the world persist in
clinging to old methods. There are men
who still use a forked stick in place of a
modern plow. There are also men, who,
when they are troubled with a disordered
stomach or liver, resort to the old-fashioned
violent remedies that rack and rend the
whole body, and while they give temporary
relief, in the long run do the entire system
a great amount of harm.
Modern science has discovered remedies
infinitely superior to these old-fashioned
drugs, that do their work by promoting the
natural processes of excretion and secre-
tion and gently correcting all circulatory
disturbances. When a man feels generally
out of sorts, when he loses sleep at night,
when he gets up headachey and with a bad
taste in his mouth in the morning, when he
feels dull and lethargic all day, when his
appetite is poor and his food distresses
him, when work comes hard and recreation
is an impossibility, that man, though he
may not believe it, is a pretty sick man.
He is on the road to consumption, nervous
prostration, malaria, or some serious blood
disease. In cases of this description a man
should resort at once to Dr. Pierce s Golden
Medical Discovery. It is the best medicine
for a weak stomach, impaired digestion
and disordered liver. It is the great blood-
maker and purifier, flesh-builder and nerve
tonic. It cures 98 per cent, of all cases of
consumption, bronchitis, lingering coughs
and kindred ailments. Thousands have
testified to its marvelous merits. It is
a modern, scientific medicine that aids
without goading nature, and that has stood
the test for thirty years. Medicine dealers

Treasury gold bullion amounting to $138,

The provision made for strengthening
the resources of the Treasury in connec
tion with the war has given increased
confidence In the purpose and power of
the Government to maintain the. present
standard and has established more firmly
than ever the national credit at home and
abroad. A i afked evidence of < this is
found in the inflow of gold to the Treas
ury. Its net gold holdings on November 1,
1898, were *JÂ«9,SSS.IGO. as compared with
$153 573,147 on November I, 18!T7: an i an in

I renew so much of my recommendation
of December. 1897. a* follows:
That when any of the United States notes
- are presented for redemption and are re
deemed in gold, such not-Â« shall be kept and
pet apart and only paid out in exchange for
Kold. This la on obvious"
duty. If the holder of â

cut paying gold for it in exchange. The rea
" â on for this Is made all the more apparent i
when the Government issue an Interest bearing |
debt to provide gold for the redemption of,
I'nited States notes, a non-Interest bearing
debt. Surely it should not pay them out again
except on demand and for gold. If they are
put out in any other way they may return
again, to be followed by another bond issue
to redeem them, another interest bearing debt
to redeem a non-Interest bearing debt.
This recommendation is made In the be
lief that such provision of law would in
sure to a greater degree the safety of the
present standard and better protect our
currency from the dangers to which it is
subjected from a disturbance in the gen
eral business conditions of the country.
In my Judgment the present condition of
the treasury justifies the immediate en
actment of the legislation recommended
one year ago, under which a portion of
the gold holdings should be placed in a
trust fund from which greenbacks should
be redeemed upon presentation, but when
- once â  redeemed should not thereafter be
paid out except for gold.
I It is not to be inferred that other legis
lation relating to our currency is not re
quired. On the contrary, there is an ob
vious demand for it. The Importance of
adequate provision which will insure to
our future a money standard related as
our money standard now is to that of
our commercial rivals, is generally recog
nized.
â  The companion proposition that our do
mestic paper currency shall be kept safe
and yet be BO related to the needs of our
Industries and internal commerce as to
be adequate and responsive to such needs
is a proposition scarcely less important.
The subject in all Its parts is commended
to the wise consideration of Congress.

The part which the American merchant
vessels and their seamen performed in .ne i
war with Spain demonstrates that this
service, furnishing both pickets and the j
! line of defense, is a national ne
cessity and should be encouraged In every ;
constitutional way.
Details and methods for the'accomplish
ment of thi!Â« purpose are discussed in '
the report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury to which the attention of Congress is I
respectfully invited.
In my last annual message I recom- !
mended that Congress authorize the ap
pointment of a committee for the purpose
of making .systematic Investigations with
reference to the cause and prevention of :
yellow fever. This matter has acquired j
an increased Importance as a result of the
military occupation of the island of Cuba '
and the commercial Intercourse V -'tween 'â 
this Island and the I'nited States which I
we have every reason to expect. The san- t
itary problems connected with our rela
tioas with the island of Cuba ana the ac
quisition of Porto Rico are no less impor
tant than those relating to finance, com
mefce and administration. It is iy earn- |
est wish that these problems may be eun
sldered by competent experts, "and that j
everything may be done which the most
recent advances in sanitary science can
Offer for the protection of "the health of i
our soldiers in those islands and of our
citizens who are exposed to the dangers
of infection from the importation of yel
low fever. I therefore renew my recom- !
mendation that the authority of Congress i
may be given and a suitable "appropriation
made to provide for a committee of ex- ;
pprts to be appointed for the purpose In- i
dicated.
Under the act of Congress approved

There are now in the regular army 57,862
officers and men. In said act It was pro
vided "that at the end of any war in \
â which the United States may become in
volved the army shall be reduced to a |
peace basis by the transfer in the same :
arm of the service or absorption by pro- j
motion or honorable discharge, under such
regulations as the Secretary of War may
establish, of supernumerary commanding -
officers and the honorable discharge or
transfer of supernumerary enlisted men. j
and nothing contained in this act shall be
construed as authorizing the permanent
Increase of the command or enlisted force
of the regular army beyond that now pro- i
vided by the law in force prior to the
passage of this act. except as to the in- j
crease of twenty-five majors provided for
in section 1 thereof.
The importance of legislation for the |
permanent increase of the army is, there
fore, manifest, and the recommendation
of the Secretary of War for that purpose I
has my unqualified approval. There can
be no question that at this time, . and
probably for some time in the future. 100,- !
000 men will be none too many to meet the
necessities of the situation. At all events,
whether that number shall be required
permanently or not. the power should be
given to the President to enlist that force '
if. in his discretion, it should be neces- i
sary, and the further discretion should be |
given him to recruit within the above :
limit from the inhabitants of the islands
with the government of which we are I
charged.
It is my purpose to muster out the en
tire volunteer army as soon as Congress \
shall provide for the increase of tne reg- :
ular establishment. This will be only an '
act of justice, and will be much appre- .
ciated by the brave men who left their
homes . and employments to help * their |
country in its emergency.

concluded. By a decree of the court In |
that case an upset price for the property
was fixed at a sum which would yield to
the Government only $2,500,000 upon its |
lion. The sale at the instance of the Gov- j
eminent was postponed first to December
35, 1897, and later, upon the application of
the United States, w;is postponed to Feb
ruary IS, 1891
Having satisfied myself that the inter
ests of the Government required that an
effort should be made to obtain a larger j
sum 1 directed the Secretary of the Treas
ury, under the ait passed March 8, LBB7,
to 'pay out of the treasury to the persons
entitled to receive the same the amounts j
due upon all prior mortgages upon the
middle and eastern divisions of said rail
road, out of any money in the treasury
not otherwise appropriated.
Whereupon the Attorney General pre- ;
pared a petition to be presented to the j
court offering to redeem said prior liens ;
in such manner as the court might direct j
and praying that thereupon the T'nited
Btatei might be held to be subrogated to
nil rights of said prior lien holders and |
that a receiver might be appointed to take
possession of the mortgaged premises and
maintain and operate the same until the i
court or Congress otherwise directed, i
Thereupon the reorganization committee j
agreed that if said petition were with- I
drawn and the sale allowed to proceed on ]
K. bruary 16 they would bid a sum at the
sale which would realize to the Govern
ment the entire principal of its debt,
$6,303,000.
Relieving that no better price could be
obtained and appreciating the difficulties
under which the Government would labor |
If it should become the purchaser of the
road at a sale, in the absence of any au
thority by Congress to take charge of and
operate the road. I directed that upon the
guaranty of a minimum bid which should
give the Government the principal of its
debt, the sale should proceed. Ky this
transaction the Government secured an
advance of $3,803,000 over and above the
sum which the court had fixed as the
upset price and which the reorganization
committee had declared was the maxi
mum which they would pay for the prop- I
erty.
It i.s gratifying to know that the result
of this proceeding against the Union Pa
cific system and the Kansas Pacific line
Is that the Government has received on j
account of its subsidy claim the sum of i
$84,751,533 ">, an increase of $18397463 75
over the sum which the reorganization
committee originally agreed to bid for the
j"iin property, the Government receiving
its whole claim principal and interest on
the Union Pacific and the principal of its
deW on the Kansas Pacific Railroad.
Steps had been taken to foreclose the
Government's lien upon the Central Paci-
lie Railroad Company,
but before action was
commenced Congress
passed an act, approved

of the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Attorney General and the
Secretary of the Interior, and their suc
cessors in office, w.*h full power to settle
the indebtedness to the Government grow
ing out of the issue of bonds in aid of
construction of the Central Pacific and
Western Pacific bond-aided railroads,
subject to the approval of the President. !
No report has yet been made to me by the j
committee thus created. Whatever action j
is had looking to a settlement of the in
debtedness in accordance with the bill re- |
ferred to will be duly submitted to Con
gress.
I deem it my duty to call to the atten
tion of Congress the condition of the pres- !
ent building- occupied by the Department
of Justice. The business of that depart
ment has increased greatly since it was
established in its present quarters. The
building now occupied by it is neither
large enough nor of suitable arrangement
for the proper accommodation of the busi
ness of the department. The supervising
architect has pronounced it unsafe and
unsuited for the use to which it is put.
The Attorney General in his report states
that the library of the department is on
the fourth floor and that all the space al
lotted to it is so crowded with books as
to dangerously overload the structure.
The first floor is occupied by the Court of
Claims. The building is of an old and i
dilapidated appearance, unsuited to the.
dignity which should attach to this im
portant department.
A proper regard for the safety, comfort
and convenience of the officers and em
ployes would justify the expenditure of a
liberal sum of money in the erection of a
ne.w building of commodious proportions
and handsome appearance upon the very
advantageous site already secured for
that purpose, including tho ground occu
pied by the present structure and vacant
ground adjoining to that comprising in
all a frontage of 201 feet on Pennsylvania
avenue and a depth of 136 feet. In this
conclusion it may be wise to refer to the
inadequate accommodations provided for
the Supreme Court in the Capitol, and
suggest the wisdom of making provision i
for the erection of a separate building for!
the court and its offices and library upon
available ground near the Capitol.

than our population. It now involves an
expenditure of $100.uu0,000 a year, numbers i

service, which is an accurate index of the j
public conditions, presents gratifying evi
dence of the advancement of education,
of the increase or commtinu atmn aim
business activity and of the improvement
of mall facilities, leading to their con
stantly augmenting use.
The war with Spain laid new and excep
tional labors in the Postofflce D' oartment
pie mustering of tne military and navai
forces of the I'nited States remiired spe
cial mail arrangements for every camp
and every campaign. The communication |
en home and camp was naturaliv
eager and expectant. In some of the i
larger places of rendezvous as many as i
50.0W letter a day required handling. This !
necessity was met by the prompt detail
<il experienced men from the established
force and by directing all the instru
mentalities of the railway mail and
postofflce service so tar as necessary
to this new need. Congress passed
an act empowering me Postmaster Gener
al to establish an offlrn or branch at every
military camp or station and under this
authority tne postal machinery was
speedily put into effective operation.
Inrler the same authority, when our
forces moved upon Cuba. Porto Kico and
the Philippines, they were attended and
followed by the postal service. Though j
the act of Congress authorized the ap
pointment of postmasters where neces
sary, it was early determined that the
public Interests would be best subserved
not by new designations, but â¢>>â¢ the <ln
tail of experienced men familiar with
every branch of the service, and this pol
icy was steadily followed. When the ter
ritory which was the theater of conflict
came, into our possession it became
necessary to rp-estahliHh mail facili
ties for the resident population as
well as to provide them for our
forces of occupation and the for
mer requirement was met through th<> ex
tension and application of the latter obli
ffntinn. I gave the requisite authority and
the same general principle was applied to
this ttÃ to other branches of rivil .".dminis
trntion under military subjection. The
details are more particularly given in the
report of the Postmaster General, and
while the work is only just begun, it is
plc;islng to be able to say that the ser
vice in the territory which hns come un

proved.

The public lands disposed of by the Gov

896.92 acres, an increase of 614.780.26 acres
over the previous year. The total receipts
irom public lands during the fiscal year
amounted to $2,277,995 18, an increase of
J1W.063 90 over the preceding year. The
lands embraced in the eleven forest reser
vations which were suspended by the act
of June 4. 1897, again became subject to
the operations of the proclamations of
I-ebruary 22, 1897, creating them, which
added an estimated amount of 19.951,360
acres to the area embraced in the re
serves previously created. In addition
thereto, two new reserves were created

At the close of the pear thirty forestry

the system of the patrol has not only pre

The special attention of Congress is
called to that part of the report of the
Secretary of the Interior in relation to the
five civilized tribes, li is noteworthy that
the general condition of the Indians shows
marked progress. But one outbreak of a
serious character occurred during the
year, and that among the Chippewa In
dians of Minnesota, which, happily, has
been suppressed.
While it has not yet been practicable to
enforce all the provisions of the act of
June 28, 1898. "for the protection of the
people of Indian Territory and for other
purposes." it is having a salutary effect
on the five tribes. The Dawes Commis
sion reports that the most gratifying re
sults and greater advance toward the at
tainment of the objects of the Govern
ment have been secured in the past year
than in any previous year. I cannot too
strongly indorse the recommendation of
the commission and the Secretary of the

the education of the 80,000 white children
resident in the Indian Territory.

COMMENT OF THE
LONDON NEWSPAPERS
LONDON, Dec. 6. â Much having been
expected there is a certain tone of dis
appointment in the morning paper edi
torials on President McKinley's mes
sage. Its non-committ " character is
attributed to the fact that the negotia
tions of the Peace Commissioners at
Paris are not finished. Considerable
satisfaction is expressed at the refer
ences to Anglo-American relations and
at the coldness displayed toward Rus
sia.
The Daily New; complains of the
"ambiguity of the message on com
mercial and currency matters," and
"the conspicuous absence of any allu
sion to free trade."
The Times says: "It is creditable to
both the dignity and good sense of the j
EATON ELECTED MAYOR
OF THE ANGEL CITY
But One Candidate on the Democratic Muni
cipal Ticket Successful.
FRED EATON, NEWLY ELECTED MAYOR OF
LOS ANGELES.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6.â The Republicans swept the city in the
election to-day. For the first time in ten years seven out of nine Re
publicans are elected to the City Council. Fred Katon has been elect
ed Mayor by 600 majority. He defeated M. P. Snyder, incumbent, by
a narrow margin. Snyder made all kinds of combinations. A total of
about 14.000 votes were cast. This was about 1000 less than were cast
at the State election. Only one Democrat on the city ticket was elect
ed. That was Captain C. 11. Hance, the present City Clerk.
A verey sharp tight was waged against John Drain, the present
Superintendent of Streets and Republican candidate for re-election,
but he has been re-elected by 500 majority. J. H. Dockweiler. the
present City Engineer, has been defeated for re-election by 1000 ma
jority.
Snyder for Mayor carried the Second, Seventh and Eighth
Wards. The last two are nominally Democratic, but the Second
Ward Snyder carried by a combination he made with the oil men to
give them anything they desired. All the corporations in the city
supported Snyder and opposed Eaton. The managers of the gas,
electric light and street railway ccompanies were in the field actively
antagonizing Eaton and lining up votes for Snyder from the time
the polls opened until they closod.
The new charter, which was advocated by both parties, was
snowed under.
American people that a message an
nouncing the victorious ending of the
great war, the acquisition of territory
and the initiation of an imperialist
policy is sober in tone and moderate in
recommendations. The war has finally
healed the half-closed wounds left by
the Titanic contests of secession
and we hope it has exercised a healing
influence to be felt even more widely
and deeply in another direction. Not
since England recognized the United
States Government's power has an
American President alluded to the
mother country in language so cordial
and friendly as Mr. McKinley's.
Discussing th^ message approving the
detail and referring to British rights
in Nicaragua under the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty, the Times says: "If the free
dom of the waterways is secured to the
ships of all nations we shall not need to
stand strictly upon claims which origi
nated when the circumstances were al
together different."
The Daily Chronicle also pays a trib
ute to the "sober soun 1 common sense
and straightforward language" of the
message, pointing out that President
McKinley's reference to the military oc
cupation of Cuba virtually outlines a
policy "precisely the same as that of
Great Britain in Egypt and likely to
have the same effect."
Commenting on the President's "sur
prising language" concerning the
Nicaragua canal, which utterly ignores
British treaty rights, the Daily
Chronicle says that "this matter will
arise ere long in a more acute form."
The editorial highly approves Mr. Mc-
Kinley's references to China and Great
Britain.
The Standard says: "Few could
have foretold that the war would work
so rapid and drastic a change. How
absolute the metamorphosis is may
best be gathered from a comparison
with previous messages. It is not rash
to predict that the United States will
advance in the path upon which their
feet are now firmly set."
The Standard construes Mr. McKin
ley's references to China as a declara
tion that, had the open door been
closed or obstructed, America would
have interfered < ctively. It adds, upon
tuis point, "For all purposes of British
policy no intimation could be more
welcome than that the United States
will appoint a committee to study the
conditions in China."
The Daily Telegraph, which regards
the announcement that the United
States will support the open door in
China as the weightiest which the
message contains, says: "With such
common interests to unite us, formal
alliances are unnecessary."
The Daily Mail says: "We are dis
appointed and surprised at this at
tempt to set aside the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty, especially in view of the Anglo-
American entente."
The Morning Post, on the other hand,
says: "Circumstances have changed
and the American attitude toward the
treaty is quite intelligible, but the im
mediate task awaiting Mr. Chamber
lain Is the ussimilation into his ad
mirable sentimental view of the
Anglo-American relations of the
thorny problem associated with the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty."
WILL NOT BE PROSECUTED.

GUN PLANT FOR
NEWPORT NEWS
Englishmen Negotiate
With Huntington.
INTEREST IN YARD SOUGHT
DEAL THAT WILL MEAN A
GREAT ENTERPRISE.
The Railroad Magnate Says the New
Establishment Will Be a
Benefit to This
Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. s.â Collis P.
Huntington confirmed to-day's report
that the English firm of Vlckers' Sons
& Maxim fs negotiating for an interest
in the Newport News shipbuilding
establishment, in which he is a heavy
owner. He said the deal had not been
closed, and denied there was any In
tention of selling the yard outright to
English interests, and intlmnted he
would continue to control the business.
"I have been in negotiation, " said
Huntington, "with Vickers' Sons &
| Maxim, who have thought of taking
large interests in the plant and of
establishing at Newport News, in con
nection with the ship yard, a very ex
tensive plant for the manufacture of
guns. If these negotiations should be
carried to a conclusion there would be
established at Newport News a new
industry which would greatly benefit
the city, furnishing work and support
to thousands of people in addition to
those there now. But the yard would
continue to be an American enterprise,
as I do not propose to sell the holdings
outright, but to rent a large interest.
I would like, however, to lessen my
cares and responsibilities and let others
take up and carry on the work I have
| started.
"The proposed gun plant would not
be a separate organization. It would
be conducted as a part of the general
business. I have wanted those people
to take a large interest because I was
anxious to see a great gun manufac
turing establishment put up at New
port News, and my impression is my
English friends will find it greatly to
their interest to complete negotia
tions. I think, too, it will be a good
thing for the Government. The Vickers'
Sons & Maxim are known over the
whole world for their skill and success
in making great ships and all sizes of
guns.
"We have started a new dock and
the work is progressing finely. wÂ«>

So-Called Republican Central Com

Bankrupt and Deeply
in Debt.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 4.â The Republican
County Central Committee, through
which "Boss" Rea and "Johnnie" Mac
kenzie made the fight for their candi
dates, is bankrupt. Not only is the ex
chequer depleted, but there is between
$1000 and $1200 worth of bills still un
paid. About fifty creditors are pursu
ing John D. Mackenzie, secretary of the
committee. The Game Warden has gra
ciously told these people time and again
that they would be paid "to-morrow or
the next day," but this promise has
been made to get the County Committee
together, but unsuces fully. Over $3000
came into the hands of the committee
through assessing candidates. Half of
this sum has not been expended, and
successful and defeated candidates are
wondering where it all went.
The committee started out at the be
ginning of the campaign with some
lofty ideas as to finances. It decided to
assess its candidate for Sheriff $500 and
all other nominees for county offices
$400. There was a general protest
among the candidates and they re
belled. They finally contributed the
following amounts set opposite their
names, at least their sworn statements
so show:

J. K. Secord, Cumner 150
Total *2400
Aside from these amounts more
money was put into the hands of the
committee. W. T. Nolting and W. J.
Kirkpatrick, candidate for Township
Justices, fail to mention in their sworn
statements any assessment paid to the
committee, taut persons on the inside
positively assert the Justices turned
over $250 each. B. A. Herrington, for
District Attorney, gave an additional
$100 that he fails to mention. This
makes $600, which, added to the $2400
heretofore mentioned, makes $3000.
The question confronting the candi
dates and the creditors is ho* - all this
money was expended under the direc
tion of Secretary John D. Mackenzie.
There are about twenty livery stable
keepers who have bills against the com
mittee ranging from $20 to $25. They
exhibit orders signed by Mackenzie, and
it looks as though this is all they will
get for the use of their teams. Band
masters are clamoring for their money,
while newspaper publishers and mer
chants are pleading for pay. Even the
heelers and clerks hired about the head
quarters have not received their prom
ised stipends.
All the money was turned over to
Mackenzie as secretary, and was to
have been expended under his direction.

CUBANS SATISFIED
WITH THE MESSAGE
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.â General
Garcia, who is still somewhat indis
posed, spent the evening at his hotel.
Mr. Quesada, speaking for the com
mission, said: "The President's mes
sage is regarded as very satisfactory.
Its publication at this time wih do good,
counteracting reports that Lave been
spread in Cuba by people who have not
the real interests of the country at
heart. We have full faith in the United

President McKinley, and the men who
have made the revolution of Cuba a
success aim to work with the United

will have the respect of nations."
MAY W PLAYED
FOR A "KILLING"
Backed at the East for
Her First Race.
CAMERON SENT THE WORD
FRIENDS AT CHICAGO TOOK
OWNER'S TIP.
Recouped by Betting on the Mare la
Her Next Race, Winning
$10,000 in Chicago
Poolrooms.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. s.â lt now develops
that May W was heavily played in
Chicago on information received from
owner Don Cameron on i November 28,
when she was so badly beaten at Oak
land with Jockey Gouin in the saddle.
D. W. Smith, a Chicago man, who was
known at the local race tracks as a
friend of Cameron, and who always
bets heavily on May W, lost $500.
Friends of his lost as much more. On
November 26 Smith received a letter
from Cameron saying the mare was
good, and would win the first time out.
The owner even went further, saying
May W was never better, and she had
been scratched once because the condi
tions did not suit her, but would win
her first start. The letter also stated
there was a race on November 2S that
suited the mare, and that she would
probably start that day, but not to
bet until a telegram came.
Smith showed the letter to some of
his friends, enjoining them to keep
the matter quiet, as he intended put
ting down a good bet and wanted a
price On November 28 Smith received
a cipher telegram. It read: "Come to
California," but according to the coae
meant "Get down on the mare." This
telegram was also showed to a select
few, and to a man they played May W
heavily.
When the report of the race came
over the tickers and May W was not
first, second or third Smith was as
tounded. It is known he is close to
Cameron, either as partner or friend,
and the men who played May W on
the strength of the letter and telegram
are certain that Cameron expected
to win the race. Some sharp cor
respondence by wire passed be
tween Smith and Cameron, but the
former was assured, it is said, that it
was all right, and another deal is al
leged to have been fixed up. May W
ran again on Saturday, with a long
price in the local books. Smith and his
friends had evidently been reassured,
for they were on hand with bundles of
money, which was so cautiously placed
that no suspicion was aroused among
the bookmakers, although the steady
play had the effect of beating down her
odds a trifle. It is estimated $10,000
was gathered in here by the operation.
From hints let drop the same game was
played in Cincinnati and . New Or
leans. ____^_______

OPINIONS OF
CONGRESSMEN
ON MESSAGE
"Able and Excellent,"
Republicans Say.
ENTERTAINING AND ACCURATE
BUT SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS
FIND FAULT.
Think the President Should Have De
fined a Form of Government for
Philippines â Silverites
Not Satisfied.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.â Many Sen
ators excused themselves from expres
sion of opinions at length upon the
message on the ground that they had
not been able to give careful attention
to all the details. Republican Senators
were, however, willing to express
themselves in a few general words of
eommendatinon.
Senator Cullom regarded It as "a
painstaking, entertaining and accurate
historical review."
Senator Platt of New York commend
ed the expression of a determination to
increase the standing army and to
maintain order In Cuba until the Cu
bans can take care of themselves.
Senator Wolcott said it was an ad
mirable document.
Senator Lodge said it was "able and
excellent."
Senator Foraker â A good presenta
tion of facts generally, but a little in
definite on the question of Cuban Inde
pendence.
Senator Proctor â A good American
paper.
The Democrats were even more
averse than the Republicans to dis
cuss the paper. Senator Jones of Ar
kansas was an exception. He found
In the message a number of points
which did not accord with his views.
One of these is the proposition to con
tinue the volunteer army in existence
until the standing army can be in
creased. "Some of us do not favor the
Increase of the standing army," he
said, "and the President has no right
to assume that a majority stand with
him on that proposition." The Arkan
sas Senator also questioned the Presi
dent's right to hold the volunteers in
service beyond the time of signing the
peace treaty, saying: "There is no war
in existence and none is imminent. The
law requires one or the other condtion,
and the threat of the President to hold
the Volunteers in service until the
standing army is increased beyond
what the consciences of Senators and
members, dictate looks to me like a
menace and an effort to dictate, which
I consider an outrage and unpardon
able."
Senator Jones interpreted the Presi
dent's expression upon the finances
as a pronouncement for the
gold standard and for the retirement of
the greenbacks, and said that he did
nnt believe that anything like a ma
jority of the American people would in
dorse him in this respect. The Senator
also announced himself as opposed to
a subsidy to vessels conm-ctine the
United States with Porto Rico. Cuba
and the Philippines, as opposed to legis
lation for the construction of the Nic
araguan canal as at present contem
plated, and expresses the opinion that
the President was inclined to go far
ther in the Government of Cuba than
the resolution of intervention called
for.
"We declared," he said, "in favor of
taking them to the point of maintain
ing a 'stable government,' and I do not
see how we can go beyond that. To
go to the extent of insuring, as the
President recommends, complete tran
quil! ty might prove a pretext for a
military government and permanent
or rupation, never to be ended. I do not
tndone any such an understanding:."
Senator Jones also expressed surprise
at the absence of any recommenda
tion concerning the Philippines. "The
question of the government of the
Philippines in attracting much atten
tion." he said, "and the fact that the
President utterly Ignores it strikes me
as very singular."
Senator Pascoe also commented upon
the absence of any reference to "points
concerning which we most desire in
formation." He said, however, that it
was a valuable historical paper and
would be convenient for future refer
ence.
Senator Teller said there would be
disappointment over the failure of the
President to outline a government for
the Philippine, saying: "There will be
BOOM disappointment in this, for I
think the understanding has been that
the President would indicate what form
of government should be provided for
these new possessions. But it is wise
for tho President not to indicate his
vlpws on that subject, for that is pure
ly and properly a legislative question
and one that should be left to Con
gress."
on the recommendation In regard to
the currency Senator Teller said: "The
friends of bimetallism, either national
or international, will find no encourage
ment from anything that the President
pays in his message. No reference is
made to international bimetallism, but
the President in the most emphatic
way Indicates his intention to main
tain the gold standard. The so-called
Silver Republicans who remain in the
Republican party and contend that
the Republican party is friendly to sil
ver will find no encouragement in the
President's message, and it will strike
all as somewhat singular that if the
Republican party, as it hns been claim
ed, is in favor of international bimetal
lism, the President makes no reference
to it."
CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMEN
LIKE THE MESSAGE
"WASHINGTON. Dec. s.â The Presi
dent's message was favorably com
mented upon by all Californians in
Congress, including Representative
De Vries (D.). Senator Perkins said:
"From a cursory examination and
reading I was most favorably im
pressed with the document. It was a
plain, straightforward statement of the
executive department affairs. The
President did not seek to dictate to
Congress like his predecessors, but gave
them much information, at the same
time delicately conveying his own opin
ions as to future legislation, which he
seems willing to intrust to Congress.
Each individual member of the Senate
and House will therefore ferl himself
a committee of one to treat the
problems presented according to
his own understanding as well
as to subserve the wishes of the people
at large and his own immediate dis
trict. I have already expressed my own
personal views against the acquisition
of territory remote from our own
shores. Time and full and free discus
sion will solve these problems, and we
will have been advised of public opin
ion, not only of the people of the United
States, but of our States and Congres
sional Districts, when Congress is ready
to deal with these questions. I have
repeatedly said I hold the opinion that
while a Senator or Representative in
Congress may have positive convictions
upon matters of governmental policy,
he must not forget that he is the repre
sentative of a community of people and
must not hold his own opinions of para
mount importance.".
Congressman Loud said: "I have not
had time to carefully study the Presi
dent's message. This will take a whole
day's time, but from a hasty examina
tion I think it was such a message as
one might have expected from Presi
dent McKinley. He presented con
cisely much information that will be
useful to Congress without assuming
to dictate."
Congressman Barham said: "I think
the message a splendid state paper.
The statement of facts preceding, dur
ing and since the war with Spain is
certainly most concise and a satis
factory treatment of the subject. The
President's views upon the necess'ty of
battle-ships and a better navy meet
my most hearty approval. The posi
tion of the President upon the con
struction of the Nicaraguan canal I
think expresses the opinion of nine
tenths of the people of the United
States, and in my opinion assures the
canal appropriations."
Congressman Hilborn said: "The
message is a very able document It is
necessarily long on account of the
number and importance of the sub
jects discussed. His recommendations
regarding the navy are wise and time
ly. I am glad that the President has
recommended that new ships of the
navy shall be sheathed. In view of our
lack of docking facilities this recom
mendation should be followed "
Representative De Vriet said: "To
California people one of the most im
portant matters treated in the message
is the urgent suggestion cc-nceming
the construction of the Nicaragua ca
nal. This is particularly gratifying
and practically Insures consideration of
the matter during the present session
of Congress."

TO INVESTIGATE THE
CONDUCT OF THE WAR
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.â Representative Sulzer of New York,
ranking member of the House Committee on Military Affairs, has
Introduced a resolution "authorizing and directing the Committee on
Military Affairs to investigate the War Department and the conduct

and directed to investigate the War Department and the conduct of
the recent war between Spain and the United States, and to report all
of said proceedings, with their findings, conclusions and recom
mendations, to the House of Representatives with all convenient

sons under oath in any part of the United States, and to employ a
stenographer; also the Sergeant-at-Arms is hereby directed to at
tend said committee and to carry out its directions.
"That the necessary expenses of the investigation be paid out
of the contingent fund of the House."
The resolution was referred to the Committee on Military Affairs.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1898.
PEACE TREATY
TO BE GIVEN
PRECEDENCE
Will Be Followed by
Others.
MINOR POINTS TO HOLD OVER
TO END WAR CONDITIONS THE
FIRST CONSIDERATION.
After the Protocol Terms Are Carried
Out America and Spain Will
Agree as to Trade
Relations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.â The impres
sion prevails here that the results of
the negotiations at Paris will be em
bodied in two or more treaties, instead
of one. There will be one actual peace
treaty, embodying nothing more than
the protocol points relating to the re
linquishment of Spanish sovereignty
over Cuba and the Spanish West In
dies, Guam and the Philippines, with
the single exception of the proviso for
the release of prisoners. All the other
matters, those relating to the renewaJ
of the commercial treaties, the acquisi
tion of cable and coaling stations, and,
in fact, all those extraneous matters
that have been mentioned as likely to
be incorporated in the peace treaty will
form the subject of a special treaty.
This course is likely to be adopted in
order to hasten the conclusion of peace,
of which there is a great necessity, if
for no other reason than to secure the
release of prisoners and the restora
tion of trade between Spain and the
United States.
There has been no evidence of fric
tion between the American Commis
sioners. It is supposed â in fact it is
known â that in their own sessions they
have differed about some points, and
have discussed these at length, but
whenever it came to the point of action
in the joint commission the Americans
were united. The last report received
from them was unanimous, bearing the
signature of every member of the com
mission.
WEYLER'S ASSISTANCE
GAINED BY SAGASTA
MADRID, Dec. s.â lmmediately after
the signing of the treaty of peace Pre
mier Sagasta will submit to the Queen
Regent a question of confidence. It is
thought probable that her Majesty will
ask Senor Sagasta to remain in power,
in which case the Cortes will be con
voked for January 7.
From the declaration of General Wey
ler it is believed that a combination of
the followers of Senor Sagasta, Romero
Robledo and General Weyler will be af
fected as soon as peace is signed.
General Weyler, in an interview, has
pronounced against the Conservatives,
declaring that Cuba was the only quci
tion which separated him from the juib
erals. He considers the internal crisis
grave, "in view of the attitude of Great
Britain, which, by encouraging civil
war, desires to do with Spain what the
United States has done with her col
onies."
Under these circumstances, Weyler
added, he considers that a Sagasta-
Robledo Cabinet would be the most able
to cope with the situation.
PEACE COMMISSIONERS
DEBATE ENERGETICALLY
PARIS, Dec. s.â The American Peace
Commission had a long conference, be
ginning at 10 o'clock, with only a brief
recess for lunch, before going to the
Foreign Office to meet the Spanish
Commissioners at 3 o'clock p. m. The
Americans, apparently, had chang?d
the form if not the substance of some
of their demands, as a result of the de
liberations during the past three days.
The Joint commission was in session
for over four hours. Much of the dis
cussion concerned details as to he guar
anteeing of the rights of Spanish citi
zens in the ceded colonies. The debate
was occasionally energetic, and the
Spaniards, on adjourning, appeared to
be dejected. Secretary Ojeda of the
Spanish Commission, when questioned
after the meeting as to the progress
made, answered excitedly:
"I am almost mad. I cannot talk.
We are making progress."
The American Commissioners de
clined to say anything further than
that the progress made was satis
factory.
The Spanish Commissioners have re
ceived authority to bind their Govern
ment on certain matters, but there are
yet important questions on which their
instructions are unsatisfactory and It
is likely that many of the detail 3 in
volved in the change of sovereignty in
the Spanish colonies will be left for set
tlement in the regular diplomatic pro
cess when relations between the two
governments are resumed.
FRENCH STATESMAN DEAD.
Passing of the Former Embassador to

PARIS, Dec. s.â Former Senator Gucges
Made Henri Portlier, who represented
the Department of Inure el Loire, is dead.
He was born in 1821 and was formerly

RAISIN COMBINE
A GREAT SUCCESS
Fair Prices Have Been
Maintained.
MASS MEETING AT FRESNO
GROWERS PLEASED WITH THE
OUTLOOK.
General Plan of the Association, for
the Past Year Approved and
Its Continuance
Voted.
Buecial Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Dec. 5.â A great mass
meeting was held to-day to consider
the future prospects and method of
procedure of the California Raisin
Growers' Association. There were rep-
resentatives present from every por
tion of the State interested in the
raisin industry, from San Diego to
Woodland. The enthusiasm was great,
and much cheering followed the read
ing of the reports showing the associa
tion's operations during the past sea
son â the first of the combir â¢Â«;.
These reports were aJI of a Mattering
character, showing the combine to have
been a success. Secretary Boots' re
port showed that there is on hand un
sold about one-quarter of this year's
crop, half of the quantity sold having
netted, at September prices, 2.59 cents,
and one-seventh, at October prices, 3.54
cents â a high average on account of
the large proportion of layer and clus
ter goods shipped. The balance of
goods sold realized 3.63 cents at ruling
rates. The general average for the sea
son was 3.08 cents to the grower per
pound, and may before the close of the
season run up to 3% cents. Sales to
date are upward of 2200 cars, leaving
on hand unsold 800 cars.
These goods were all controlled by
the association. Outsiders put on the
market 250 cars, decreasing the price
for all by about half a cent a pound.
Payments for handling the cars al
ready shipped were $273,692 50; com
missions $125,286 31, one-third of which
is profit. The expenses of the associa
tion amounted to- $10,005 18.
Treasurer T. C. White's report shows:
Total receipts to date, $1,408,077 09; dis
bursements, $1,331,496 01; balance on
hand. $76,581 08.
â  General Manager Sayre reported the
purchase of 290 ten-ton cars for $152,
439 24; association shipments 3094 cars,
with 824 on hand.
According to Director Nathan, the
total shipments from all points in the
State was 2244 cars.
The meeting indorsed the general
plan of the association for the past
year, and resolved upon its continu
ance for the coming season, with such
modifications as experience had shown
to be desirable. These will be that the
growers do their own packing of rais
ins or a percentage of the crop, and
that all sales be made as during the
past seasonâ through the central agen
cy of the combine, to control both the
market output and, necessarily, the
ruling price.
BIRTHDAY PRESENT
OF TEN MILLIONS
Fortune Frank Gould Receives on
Reaching His Twenty-First
Year.
NEW YORK. Dec. s.â Ten million
dollars came into the possession of
Frank Jay Gould to-day. He iB the
youngest child of the late Jay Gould,
and this was 1 "i twenty-first birthday.
Frank Gould is a modest, hard-work
ing, studious young man who thor-
oughly understands the railroad busi
ness and may be found any day plod
ding away at the offices of the Missouri
Pacific Railroad Company. He is said
to be very capable and to be well able
to handle his big fortune. Neverthe
less, it is said that the fortune is left
in trust and that he is only allowed
to spend the income that shall accumu
late In the future.
In receiving only the income of his
inheritance, Frank Gould is in the same
position as his brothers and sisters.
Tholr father did not allow any of them
to get absolute possession of his or her
share of the estate. He divided his
vast fortune of about $70,000,000 into
six parts and left to each of his six
children a part. Each gets an income
from his or her part, but the capital
remains in control of all as trustees.
Frank Gould's fortune is mainly in
vested in railroad and telegraph stocks
and bonds.

all stories representing that the Pope

CLEVELAND'S SCANDAL
ON BENCH AND BAR
Before Opening Court Judge Dellen
baugh Says He Will Demand
an Investigation.
CLEVELAND, Dec. s.â Judge F. E.
Dellenbaugh, against whom charges
were made by the Bar Association on
Saturday in connection with the dis
barment proceedings against State
Senator Burke, was on the bench to

gation.
It Is understood that the charges
against Judge Blandin will be filed with
the Bar Association shortly for slan
dering Judges Ong and Dissette, whom,
it will be recalled. 'Judge Blandin men
tioned in his scathing arraignment of
the bench of the county during his
sensational address before the trial
committee of the Bar Association. It
is stated that as soan as the Bar Asso
ciation acts on thr> Burke verdict the
charges against Judge Blandin will be
placed in the hands of the grievance
committee.
DOES COLOMBIA ACT ON
A SECRET AGREEMENT?
Belief That the Republic Is Aiding
the United States in a Canal
Scheme.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS9S. by James Gor
don Bennett.
PANAMA, Colombia, Dec. s.â The
Washington dispatch to the Herald,
which announces the receipt of a dis
patch from United States Minister Hart
at Bogota, which states that the Col
ombian Congress has refused to extend
the time of the Panama Canal Com
pany, has been printed here and has
created a stir in canal circles. The
general opinion is that an agreement
exists between Colombia and the Unit
ed States whereby the latter Govern
ment is to take over the works when
the contract lapses for want of funds
to carry on the project. The capital
of the company, I am informed, is al
most exhausted and the action of the
Colombian Congress is expected to pre
vent the raising of another sou.
Nobody here entertains any idea that
the United States seriously regards the
Nicaragua route as more feasible or
practical from an engineering or finan
cial standpoint than the Panama route.
The latter scheme is considered to be
far better because the canal is two
fifths completed, an enormously valu
able plant is already on the ground and
the route is much shorter.
TWO ELECTION CONTESTS.
SAN JOSE, Dec. s.â Petitions for con
tests of the elections of Joseph A. Lotz,
Treasurer, and R J. Langford, Sheriff,
were filed to-day b- Walker Jones on
behalf of E. W. Conant and J. H. Lyn
don, the defeated candidates under the
returns. The allegations are that sev
eral hundred votes were lost to vie con
testants by wrongful counting and the
throwing out of votes as in gal which
should have been counted.

ILL WHEN SENT
FROM AGNEWS
Miss Bailey Was Al
most Helpless.
CONDUCTOR ROACH'S STORY
GAVE ASSISTANCE TO THE DE
MENTED GIliL.
Says She Had a Gripful of Medicines,
One of Which She Spoke
of as a "Sleeping
Powder."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. s.â Bessie Bailey,
the Agnews patient who died on her
way East, was in no condition physic
ally or mentally to make a long trip to
the home of her uncle, Cyrus Tim
mons, at Lafayette, Ind. If the blame
for her death cannot be fixed on the
physicians of the asylum surely they
are open to censure for having allowed
the girl to leave there in her condition.
Bessie Bailey was as helpless as a
six-year-old child, and her condition
attracted the attention of Conductor
Con Roach, whose train the girl
boarded at Milpitas. To Roach she
said she had a whole gripful of medi
cine.
"I didn't sleep any last night, but as
soon as I get in the car I'll take a
sleeping powder." remarked Bessie
Bailey to Roach, as he was assisting
her aboard the overland train at Oak
land pier.
Just what this powder was. or who
gave it to her, is unknown. The phy
sicians at Agnews had prepared some
medicine for her to take, but they
made no mention of sleeping powders.
Conductor Roach was seen at the St.
James Hotel to-night. He said Bessie
Bailey boarded his train on the morn
ing of November 17 at Milpitas. He
paid no particular attention to her un
til near Oakland, when she asked him
to raise a window. He did this, and
then she spoke about having her trunk
rechecked. She also wanted to know
if he had not seen her get on the train
at Milpitas. When the mole was
reached Roach went with the girl and
had her trunk checked.
Miss Bailey was nervous and excited.
Roach's attention was attracted more
particularly to her condition. She in
quired about policemen and seemed
afraid to travel. She was peculiar, and,
he thought, slightly demented. The
girl complained of being cold and ex
pressed a wish for some coffee. Roach
took her into Owen Rooney's restau
rant, and they both had coffee â  and
toast. While there she showed him' a
letter Dr. Stocking had given her to
show to conductors, and then he saw
she had just been discharged from Ag
news Asylum. He at once took more
interest in her. The letter explained
that the Bailey girl was unaccustomed
to traveling and asked trainmen to look
out for her.
When they finished their coffee.
Roach took up two grips the girl had
and escorted her to the overland train,
which left at 8:30. He remarked that
she had considerable baggage, and Miss
Bailey told him that the smaller grip
contained nothing but medicines. On
the way to the car she told him she
had slept none during the night, but
as soon as she got Into the car she
would take a sleeping powder. She
told him she was going to write to him,
and he tore a page out of a memoran
dum book and wrote his name on it and
gave it to her. There was no one in the
car when he left her.
Roach was with Bessie Bailey about
forty-five minutes, and he says that all
that time she hardly knew what she
was doing. She told him of going to
visit her uncle In Indiana.
When Bessie Bailey left Agnews
Asylum she was given a sedative, and
this may have been what she referred
to as a sleeping powder. Whatever it
was she had she brought It from Ag
news, for she had no opportunity to
purchase It between there and Oak
land.
The physicians at Agnews deny that
any criminal operation was performed
on Bessie Bailey there, and to-day Drs.
Sponogle, Stc-cking and Christal made
statements to that effect.
ACCUSED OF POACHING.
Oakland Sportsman's Arrest Caused
by the Cordelia Club.
STTIST'N, Dec. s.â The first case of al
leged poaching since the decision of the
Supreme Sourt in the case of the Corde
lia Gun Club vs. McCrea et al. will come
before Judge Buckles next Monday. The
defendant is Robert Boyer. a cigar drum
mer of Oakland, against whom a writ of
attachment has been issued at the in
stance of the Cordelia Gun Club. I? is al
leged that Boyer shot ducks on the pre
serves owned by the club, in violation of
a perpetual Injunction issued from the Su
perior Court against trespassers.

ThJE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
TO those persons who expected the President to
submit to Congress a definite and final policy
of action with regard to the islands taken from
Spain the Presidential message will prove disap
pointing. To those, however, who understand the
difficulties of the problem and the necessity of a
thorough consideration of every issue before any ir
revocable step is taken in connection with it, the
cautious and conservative statesmanship displayed in
the message will be highly gratifying.
The President urges no hasty action, no leap in
the dark. He reviews for the instruction of Congress
the events leading up to the war, the conduct of the
war and the situation as it stands, and in conclusion
says:
"I do not discuss at this time the government or
the future of the new possessions which will come
to us as the result of the war with Spain. Such a
discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of
peace shall be ratified. In the meantime, and until
Congress has legislated otherwise, it will be my duty
tc continue the military government which has ex
isted since our occupation and give the people secur
ity in life and property and encouragement under a
just and beneficent rule."
It is to be noted that the President does not include
Cuba among "the new possessions which will come
to us as the result of the war with Spain." He re
views the Cuban situation separately and announces
that as soon as we are in possession "and have paci
ried the island, it will be necessary to give aid and
direction to this people to form a government for
themselves." The President does not mean, how
ever, to shirk any of the responsibilities that morally
rest upon us to prevent a reign of lawlessness in the
island, for he adds: "Neither revenge nor passion
should have a place in the new Government. Until
there is complete tranquillity on the island and a
stable government inaugurated, military occupation
will continue."
While not expressly urging upon Congress the rec
ommendations of the Hawaiian Commission as to the
form of government to be provided for Hawaii, the
President virtually does so by declaring: "It is be
lieved their recommendations will have the earnest
consideration due to the magnitude of the respon
sibility resting upon you, to give such shape to the
relationship of those mid-Pacific lands to our home
Union as will benefit both in the highest degree."
While wisely leaving the decision of the perplexing
questions involved in the government of the islands
to a time when experience in their management shall
enable us to judge better how to deal with them, the
President is quite firm and decided on other matters
hardly less important. For the construction of the
Nicaragua canal, for the encouragement of our mer
chant marine, and for currency reform, he asks imme
diate legislation.
Important reasons exist for prompt action in each
of these cases, but particularly in that of the canal.
Serious complications menacing the canal project
have arisen in Nicaragua, and after stating them fully,
the President says: "All these circumstances suggest
the urgency of some definite action by Congress at
this session, if the labors of the past are to be utilized
and the linking of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by
a practical waterway is to be realized."
On that showing the country has a right to expect
that this long delayed issue will be dealt with at last,
and our Government take this winter the first step in
the accomplishment of the great enterprise.
The message is long, but not too long for the
themes discussed. This has been a momentous year
for the republic. The President has as compactly as
possible stated the problems before us. and outlined
a policy of wise and prudent statesmanship. The
ri(-c aÃe W ni surely have the approval of the CQn _
servative sentiment of the country.
One pleasing feature of the confession of Becker
to the charge of forgery is that there is nothing now
in the way of going ahead with the trials of the rascals
who were associated with him, and who have tried to
escape punishment by loading him with all the blame.
Young women who make palpably fake pretense of
attempting suicide ought to pay space rates for ac
counts of it, with extra, of course, where the accom
panying picture presents ttiem as beautiful.
Among all the European nations Italy and Switzer
land alone do not wish the active anarchist con
demned to death. The first produces him and' the
second has little trouble with him.
When the Examiner shall have switched its "na
tional policy" rot over to the funny column, it will be
given credit for having recognized the fitness of
things.
SENATORIAL QUALIFICATIONS.
THE discussion of Senatorial qualifications is nut
a novel thing in California, nor should it ever
become obsolete. The Senator represents the
State. The office is peculiarly exalted by the con
stitution. A member of the House has a term of two
years and the President a term of four years, while a
Senator has a term of six years. A Senator outlasts
an administration and a half, and covers three Con
gresses, three terms of a Representative. This ar
rangement projects the State into affairs in such a
way as to assure continuity of policy. The Executive
may change and the House does, but the Senate con
tinues beyond either, and stands guard against the
effects of erratic change in affairs that might injure
the country.
Therefore, there is no issue in their politics of
greater interest to the people than the character and
qualifications of the men who are to represent the
wishes and the majesty of a State in the Senate.
The San Francisco Post has often discussed this
subject with a singularly clear and elevated estimate
of what a Senator should be. That paper, too, is
rather fond of girding at Senator Perkins and taking
the public into its confidence in its idea and measure
of Senator Perkins' disqualifications. As recently as
the 29th ult. it had a double-measured editorial set
ting forth its opinion of his Senatorial demerits, in
which, by direction and implication, it recorded its
idea of what a Senator should be. In this editorial the
Post said:
"In the person of Honorable George C. Perkins the
State of California has a statesman who is controlled
by his environment rather than being himself a con
trolling factor in it. What he will do under any given
circumstances cannot be foretold, for the very obvious
reason that he entertains no well defined opinion upon
any question of statecraft. In fact, his statesmanship
is of the amateur order. Senator Perkins has been
an industrious man, but his activities have been com
mercial rather than educational. He has been so
much engrossed in his successful commercial career
that but a limited time has been afforded him for
mastering the lessons of history or even studying the
most primitive principles of civil government. In the
absence of well-defined convictions as to the pur
poses of government, and what relation it should sus
tain to the people, Senator Perkins is a statesman
without compass or rudder."
Yet Senator Perkins served in the California Leg
islature, had a successful term as Governor and
brought all this public experience with him into the
Senate. His public life is free from scandals and his
progress in official promotion has been brought about
by the people themselves, before whom he has gone
to judgment in the ballot-box. If, with all this, the
Post considers him unfit for Senator, we would like
the opinion of that journal upon the qualifications of
Colonel Burns, who desires to be Senator Perkins'
colleague. Has Colonel Burns found time, while
achieving commercial success, to deeply inform .him
self in the lessons of history? Has he mastered the
principles of civil government? Is he informed of
the relations of government to the people? Has he
well-defined opinions, based upon knowledge, of the
various questions of statecraft with which he must
deal?
In fine, what qualification has Colonel Burns that
Senator Perkins lacks? Has his public life been
purer? When set over few things by the people, was
he so faithful to his trust as to deserve to be master
over many things?
If the Post's estimate of Senator Perkins is cor
rect, is there not all the more need to send as his
:olleague a man who is up to the exalted measure of a
Senator set forth by that paper?
Why is not the Post in the field, saving the credit
of the State by presenting such a man, pointing out
his merits, giving a list of his acts which prove his
scholarship, his mastery of history and statecraft and
his honor unstained, as a Senator should be?
If the Post is not belittling Senator Perkins from
sheer malice, or envy, or wantonness, it is doing that
which is always unpleasant to a journalist, incurring
personal hostility for the public good. If so, it cannot
content itself and make its calling sure with the peo
ple by publishing its low estimate of the Senator we
have, but must labor to prevent a duplication of that
which it affects to consider a misfortune to the State.
THE EXPLOSIVE MILL.
WHILE powder is useful only from its tendency
to explode, the fact is recognized that the ex
plosion must, to produce the best results, be
hedged about with certain restrictions.
Yesterday there was another fatal accident in a
powder^factory across the bay. It is high time that
similar catastrophes so near centers of population be
made impossible. Of course, the only way to bring
this condition is to banish the factories to an island
or a wilderness. In doing this there should be no
delay.
Every employe of a powder mill takes his life in
hie hands. He knows the risk he faces, and with
eyes open he meets the desperate chance. There may
be possibility of protecting him through the enforce
ment of precautions now neglected. Be this as it
â¢may, there are methods by which the public can be
protected. The public cannot pack up and go. It
can reasonably ask that the disintegrated powder mill
be not rebuilt upon the site of havoc and death.
It is a strange circumstance that there should be so
many explosions in this vicinity. California produces
a large quantity of powder, but it does not produce
more than all the rest of the United States, yet it does
supply most of the fatal explosions. San Francisco
remembers well the tragedy of seven or eight years
ago, when all the cities around the bay were rocked
and shaken as with a mighty earthquake. At that
time hundreds of lives were endangered, thousands
of dollars of damage wrought. But no lesson was im
pressed. At short intervals ever since the event has
been repeated on a smaller scale.
There is no sense in permitting this to continue.
Let the powder mill seek the Farallones or some spot
equally remote. Its presence is a constant menace.
There should be placed on human life a greater value
than upon the prosperity of any industry. To elim
inate the powder mill from the centers of population
would not impair the industry, and even if it were to
do so there ought to be no hesitation in taking the
step.
An evening paper calls for a vigilance committee to
attend to the Board of Education. Surely, the courts
ought to be equal to this task. And perhaps the peo
ple deserve punishment, anyhow, for electing Wallers,
Ragans and Druckers to places of trust.
Germany's answer to the proposition of the Czar
for disarmament has been an increase in the military
strength. Evidently the Kaiser fears he is being given
what is known in diplomatic circles as a jolly.
If the latest Custom-house scandal is based on fact,
Special Moore should be bounced so quickly that he
would not have a chance to resign.
As a health resort for defaulters New Mexico seems
to be more or less of a failure.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6. 1898.
fJN IDEAL SAN FRANCISCO.
pi; NCOURAGED by the success which has thus
I far attended her efforts to provide the Univer-
s ityâ * sity of California with a home of surpassing
beauty and grandeur, Mrs. Hearst has undertaken a
task of far greater magnitude â that of providing plans
along which San Francisco may be developed into an
ideal metropolis.
To many persons the magnitude of the new enter
prise will seem so great that they will regard the plan
as impracticable and will be averse to giving it sup
port. On the other hand, that very magnitude will
attract many people and awaken their enthusiasm. It
remains to be determined which of these classes pre
vail in the city. If we decide that the undertaking is
beyond our strength then it will be so, but if we
resolve to accomplish it and work to that end, it will
be not wholly beyond our abilities, and the realization
will in no small measure show forth the grandeur of
the ideal.
The plan as outlined is a comprehensive one. The
leading architects and engineers of the world are to
be invited to devise a programme of improvements,
including sewers, streets, parks and buildingsâ in
short, all the constructive work required to build up a
great city. Along the lines of the plan which shall be
adopted all future construction shall be carried out
as far as possible. The objects to be attained are con
venience, health, beauty and dignity.
The advantage resulting from the adoption of a
well-ordered plan of municipal improvements, and
then working systematically to carry it out, is too
self evident to need an argument to sustain it. If Mrs.
Hearst's munificent civic patriotism offered nothing
more than that it would still be a gift of vast value to
the city. Her aspiration, however, is for something
more. She would not only provide us with a plan
suitable for a city, but the best plan for making this
the best city in the world.
It is always helpful to a community to have well
defined ideals. However weak and infrequent may be
the attempts to realize them, every effort in that direc
tion results in some gain. Moreover, improvements
made in one city lead to improvements elsewhere.
Paris, made beautiful by Napoleon 111, roused the
emulation of all Europe, and .brought about that
movement toward municipal improvement which has
accomplished so much to make the modern city clean,
healthful and attractive by its beauty, as well as by its
wealth.
Mrs. Hearst's liberality has opened to San Fran
cisco a way to accomplish great things. No other city
on the globe, with the possible exception of Edin
burgh, is so picturesquely situated as this, and Edin
burgh has nothing like the possibilities that await San
Francisco. Destiny and the expanding commerce of
the Pacific will make on this peninsula a great metrop
olis, but it depends upon San Franciscans themselves
whether that metropolis is to be merely a swarming
hive of people or the model city of the twentieth cen
tury.
BY frequent repetition of the statement that
Great Britain prevented a European alliance
from interfering against us in the war with
Spain, and by reason of the cordial feeling with which
that statement has been received in this country,
some British journals seem to have persuaded them
selves that Great Britain is entitled to as much credit
and as much profit from the war as the United States.
The Saturday Review, for example, in discussing
the work of the Peace Conference at Paris, says:
"Let us be frank and say outright that we expect
mutual gain in material interests from this raproche
ment. The American Commissioners at Paris are
making their bargain, whether they realize it or not,
under the protecting naval strength of England, and
we shall expect a material quid pro quo for this as
sistance. We expect the United States to deal gen
erously with Canada in the matter of tariffs, and we
expect to be remembered when the United States
comes into possession of the Philippines, and above
all we expect her assistance on the day, which is
quickly approaching, when China comes up for set
tlement, for the young imperialistic has entered upon
a path where it will require a froog friend, and a
lasting friendship between two nations is secured, not
by frothy sentimentality or puppet forms, but by re
ciprocal advantages in solid, material interests."
After what was accomplished during the war by the
American navy, this assertion that our Commission
ers at Paris are making terms with Spain "under the
protecting naval strength of England" comes near
carrying impudence to the extreme limit. It goes
without saying that every repetition of that kind of
talk tends to weaken the friendly relations of the two
countries. We are not yet so deeply enamored of
a British alliance that we can tolerate the presump
tuous claim of a British naval protection.
The statement, however, is not to be passed over
as unworthy of notice. It shows what will be ex
pected of us if we enter upon the foolish policy of an
nexing the Philippine Islands, taking an active part
in the tortuous diplomacy of the Orient, and imitating
European nations in making aggressions there.
So long as the United States follow the wise poli
cies of the past and avoid the temptation to enter
upon a career of conquest, so long they will need no
ally nor have any cause to fear the world in arms. If,
however, the imperialistic career is undertaken the
result will prove that the boastful Saturday Review
was right in asserting that we will need a strong
friend, and then we shall learn that "lasting friend
ship between two nations is secured not by frothy sen
timentality or puppet forms, but by reciprocal advan
tages in solid material interests."
Two Kentuckians who recently fought a duel fired
just a shot apiece. They went then to the morgue
and lay peacefully on adjacent slabs. The example
they set is respectfully called to the attention of
French editors, who think they are fighting when
court-plaster is sufficient to cover the worst wound
they receive.
There does not seem much tendency among the
authorities at Agnews to 6tir up the scandal created
by the sudden death of a handsome ex-patient.
Doubtless, however, this matter will be attended to for
them.
The German press is urging the Kaiser to seize a
Philippine island, and although that gentleman does
not always display a fine grade of discretion, he seems
to have more sense than his editorial advisors.
Philadelphia may be a little slow, but like other
cities it has just indulged in a fake prize-fight, and
there is something almost live about the manner in
which she is kicking herself.
There is a cheering prospect that our children's
:hildren will see Federal business transacted in the
milding designed years ago for the purpose.
Aguinaldo is said to have changed his religion, but
in whatever guise he may assume, it is safe to say he
is for sale at about the old figure.
If that Mad Mullah fellow is half as mad as he
looks what he needs is a straitjacket and a keeper.
SOME BRITISH BOAStING.
WHAT THE PEOPLE THINK OF DAN BURNS-
Opinions Concerning the Railroad's Senatorial Candidate
Culled From the Interior Press.
Since William F. Herrin, chief of the
Southern Paciflo Company's political
bureau, announced that Colonel D. M.
Burns is the railroad's candidate for
United -States Senator a storm of pro
tests have gone up from the people of
all sections of the State. Some idea of
the way in which the announcement of
Colonel Burns' candidacy has been re
ceived by the press of the State may be
gained by a perusal of the following
clippings from interior papers:
Burns Should Adjourn.
Napa Register.
It is said that Dan Burns is consid
ering whether or not he will "take the
Senatorship." If he considers the wel
fare of the Republican party and the
best interests of California he will ad
journ the caucus he is holding with
himself and go back to the "fads" he so
affectionately speaks of as his.
A Blotted Escutcheon.
Arbuckle New Era.
Since the withdrawal of M. H. de
Young from the Senatorial contest
Colonel Dan Burns "of Mexico" seems
to be the favorite with his party. He is
said to be the choice of Governor-elect
Gage. From a Democratic standpoint
he is a good man for the Republicans
to send to the Senate, but, politics laid
aside, Californians feel that they can
scarcely afford to have themselves rep
resented at the nation's capital by a
man with the sort of a blot on his
escutcheon that attaches to the name of
the colonel.
Prayer for Delivery.
Santa Clara Journal.
Dan Burns is said to be a candidate
for Senator. From such an affliction,
good Lord, deliver us.
An Insolent Affront.
Los Angeles Times.
We look upon even the bare mention
of the name of Dan Burns for the Sen
ate of the United States as an insolent
affront to the people of the State of
California, Not to say so would be the
evasion of a plain duty.
A Senatorial Impossibility,
Tulare Register.
Mr. Herrin has stated in an author
ized interview that his preference for
United States Senator is Mr. Daniel
Burns. That settles it for Mr. Burns.
He thereby becomes a Senatorial im
possibility if he was not such an im
possibility before and his election would
absolutely undo the Republican party
in this State and wreck the political
fortunes of the men, now held in high
esteem, who are looked to guide the
Republican party clear of breakers.
A Clean Man Needed.
San Diego Tribune.
"Senator Dan Burns." Never! That
job is waiting a clean man devoted to
the interests of the people. California
doesn't want a political papster repre
senting her in the Senate.
A Missing Adjective.
Los Anceles Times.
Dan Burns says politics is his fad.
But Daniel left out the adjective
"crooked."
Is He the Right Man?
Los Angeles Times.
The San Francisco race track, of
which Dan Burns is a practical part,
continues to reap Its victims. The
latest Is Peter McGlade, who is on the
way back from Deming to meet dis
honor in the home from which he fled.
And Mr. Huntington's hired man thinks
Dan Burns is the right man for United
States Senator.
A Shameful Candidacy.
Red Bluff Sentinel.
The highest and lowest officials of the
Southern Pacific Company have re
peatedly asserted that "the railroad is
out >f politics," but this statement is

announced to M. H. de Young of the
Chronicle and J. D. Spreckels of The
Call at an interview held in the lat
ter's office that Dan Burns is the rail
road's candidate for United States
Senator.
This will come as a staggering blow
to the mass of the people of California.
The Democratic party has repeatedly
charged that the Republican party is
dominated and controlled by the South
ern Pacific Company and Mr. Herrin's
statement makes a clean-cut issue be
tween the people and the railroad com
pany.
Dan Burns was repudiated by the Re
publican party four years ago when M.
M. Estee was defeated for Governor
and the balance of the ticket was elect
ed by large majorities.
Burns represents the corrupt boss ele
ment of politics and has a small fol
lowing in San Francisco which he ab
solutely controls. He is a shrewd
manipulator of conventions and at
the last State convention had thirty
eight of the 160 votes from San Fran
cisco in his vest pocket. It would be a
lasting disgrace to California to elect
Boss Burns as United States Senator
and it is infamous that the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company should at
tempt to thwart the wishes of the peo
ple of this State by proposing to elect
a man with the history and record of
Burns.
The railroad company should be given
to understand in an unmistakable way
that it cannot dictate the election of a
United States Senator. It has pleaded
persecution at the hands of its enemies
and it now lays itself open to the
charges so often made.
It should be served with notice that
the people - ill not tolerate its dictation
and interference, and we are glad that
in the next Legislature Tehama County
will be represented by two high-minded
gentlemen, aLove reproach in every
way, who will be beyond the reach of
corporation influences, and who we
think would consider It a c ;grace to
vote for Boss Burns as the railroad's
candidate f.r Senator.
Takes It for a Joke.
Berkeley World-Gazette.
This talk of Burns being a candidate
for United States Senator must be a
joke, or a boomlet born out of season;
it is hard to conceive of any one In
California really wanting Burns in the
Senate. It would, in short, mean car
rying jobbing in politics to that ex
treme that the people, in self-defense,
would have to revive the early methods
employed in this State, whereby un
bearable crimes were settled by "a
committee authorized to act." It is
earnestly to be hopfcd that "doing poll
tics" will not reach a stage justifying
such severe measures.
A Boss Gone to Seed-
Auburn Republican.
Not satisfied with their efforts to
force De Young into the Senatorial
fight, the Democrats are now under
taking to force Colonel Dan M. Burns
into the struggle. Quite probable, when
the Legislature meets, the Republican
party, which controls a large majority
of its members, will have Just a little
to say. They certainly will not permit
the small fraction of fusionists to rob
the party of the fruits of its great vic
tory by sending a mere nonentity, or
a boss gone to seed, to the Senate of
the United States.
Another Point of View.

There is little doubt that Colonel Dan

Burns insists in staying in the fight,
here's guessing that he will win.
Not that he ought to. His election as

Made by Supervisor
Delany.
Reverend Father Otis. Father McCorry
and George D. Shadburne made a vain at
tempt yesterday to get the Board of Su
pervisors to reconsider its action rescind
ing the apportionment of $75,000 to St.
Mary's Park. Upon motion of Dr. Clin
ton Mr. Shadburne was granted the privi
lege of the floor and he took advantage of
the opportunity to deliver an eloquent ap
peal in behalf of the measure.
Mr. Shadburne had his law books with
him and quoted from them to show that
the board had no legal right to rescind
its previous appropriation, as it was mada
for a specific purpose. Upon a motion of
Devany the matter was allowed to pass
to come up in Its regular order.
Yesterday's meeting was called to order
by Supervisor Britt, who remained in the
chair during the hour's tardiness of
Mayor Phelan.
Clinton's anti-gambling ordinance was
knocked In committee, as was the anti
everything but slot machines resolution of
Supervisor Delany.
The following bids for the furnishing of
the Hall of Justice were opened: Leahy
Bros., $*3,780; George H. Fuller Desk Com
pany, $77,990; San Francisco Novelty and
Plating Works, $81,800; California Artistic
Metal and Artistic Iron "Works Company,
177,998.
Without granting to any other archi
tects the privilege of bidding. Shea & Shea
were ordered by the board to prepare
plans and specifications for a water-fil
tering system for the City Hall to cost not
more than $CSOO, and for a new police sta
tion in the Mission to cost $50,000.
The plan for the sweeping of streets
that was submitted by the Merchants'
Association was adopted.
By a unanimous vote Mayor Phelan's
veto of the ordinance providing for the
paving of Post street, between Leaven
worth and Hyde, was overruled.
The petition of the Western Athletic
Club for a permit to give a boxing con
test was reported upon favorably by the
committee, out an objection by Delany
precipitated a vote, and the resolution
was lost. The petition of the Excelsior
Club for an extension of time was re
ferred to the Health and Police Commit
tee. ____^_^__^_^_

v will miss old Morosco's when,
tew weeks, .that theater closes for
ad refurnishing and the stock
company goes off to do the road until
the opera season Is over. Mis
pi^n street won't seem its own
warm self without the Morosco melo
drama. They may reset the Grand in
and diamonds and bring on a
hundred Melbas, but there will be
hearts and lonesome nights
o" Market. No father could have
been kinder to his children than Mr.
Morosco has been to his patrons. He
aught them what they want, and
'iven it to them week in and year
ithout deviation or surprise. Every
Monday night punctually at S the melo
.t has entered a new week, always
with a new title and often with new
ry, but always the same old piece
the came old people and the
â¢lor and the thrills in the same old
Mr. Morosco never has trifled
his patrons. They have learned
re his faithful play as a brother,
and they will mourn and mourn when
he takes it away.
"Blacklisted" was the happy title last
flight and the incidental motive was an
nounced as "the strugrle between capi
tal and labor." As usual poor capital
got the under side and the conclusion
I IV found the husky hero and
the horny-handed sons of toil wallow
ing in prosperity and vindication. Capi
tal is not popular at Morosco's. Mr.
Landers Stevens represented it last
night in a deep shell frock coat, cynical
bat and a dangerous pumpkin-col
ored waistcoat. He was all that was
rich and vile. Mr. James M. Brophy
stood for coatless Labor in uncreased
trousers an 1 a pure white shirt cut
Byronically low in the chest. Mr. Bro
phy was the husky hero, virtuous and
true. Virtue and truth inevitably stalk
in uncrtased trousers at Morosco's,
even, if they don't always wear a pure
white shirt â as for instance Mr. Fred
J. Butler, who represented the sire of
the pursued heroine in dejected tailor
ing and last month's haberdashery. Mr.
lUitier wa3 the soiled mechanic. His
daughter had no visible occupation be
â  being loved and almost
lured, but Miss Lorena Atwood dressed
the part down with proper humbleness.
After Mr. Stevens the only persons
who attempted to be stylish were the
six haughty privates in a militia regi
and they were as unpopular with
the audience as they were with the
linking iniil hands. Mr. Brophy's
while shirt was against him at first,
but as soon as Mr. Stevens had set
.> the mill with intent to fasten
the arson on the strikers and Mr. Bro
phy had rushed into the flames with a
lireproof ax and been returned to the
center of the stage by the explosion of
a can of coai oil, the audience took him
to their hearts, white shirt and all.
But something must have happened
to that shirt, for Mr. Brophy wore his
coat when the curtain went up on the
next act. Mr. Stevens had exchanged
his heavy wardrobe for an Ascot tcarf
and a suit of seductive tweeds. And
the plot congested. The tweeds were
too much for the simple temperament
of Mr. Butler who was taken with in
sanity and almost parted Act 111 in the
center by shooting Mr. Stevens in the
Bcarf. This did not stop the play,
however, for the shooting had be.*i
done with Mr. Brophy's marked pis
tol, and that husky hero was promptly
arrested by the six proud privates,
while the assistant villain filled tie
gap left by the late Mr. Stevens.
There were no notable changes of
raiment in Act IV; the plot was strictly
adhered to, everything coming out as
the audience wanted it to come ana
everybody leaving the theater in
friendliness and satisfaction.
ASHTON STEVENS.
Alcazar.
There were no vacant Beats in the Al
cazar Theater last evening- and not a few
pretty faces and dresses were to be seen
in the audience. The occasion was a ben
efit of St. Brigid's parish. Financially
the 'air was a success and theatrically
It was a triumph.
Those on the stage old all in their
rower to please and their efforts were met
with unstinted applause and other marks
cf appreciation.
The curtain rose with a clever little one-
Bet comedietta, "Keeping Up Appear
ances." This is a production of Miss
L.ouise Veiller. :It is a simple domestic
*tory of a young lawyer and his wife, who
Vecome separated on account of her jeal
ousy and his stubbornness. A reconcilia
tion Is brought about in a peculiar man
lier, through an unexpected visit of the
ler, through an unexpected visit of the
fife's father. The young estranged couple
agreed to occupy the same house for one
day to keep up appearances. That set
tled it. This is the first appearance of this
curtain-raiser. Ernest Hastings and Miss
Gretche'n Lyons were well adapted to the
parts of husband 1 and wife and George
Osbourne made an excellent old doting
"The Private Secretary" that followed
was a decided success. In fact, the comi
cal situations, as portrayed by the Alca
zar stock company, produced as much
merriment as when presented eight years
ago in the Baldwin by Sol Smith Russell
and Lillian Owens. . .
Howard Scott took the part of the pri
vate secretary, Robert Spauldlng, and his
conception of the character was as fine
as that of any who have filled the trying
role in the past. George Osbourne as Mr.
Cattermole, rich uncle of Douglas Cat
termole, a young high flyer, made as much
fun as any one. Douglas, the nephew,
was personated by Ernest Hastings, who
la good in many lines.
Gretchen Lyons and Laura Crews made
up well as giddy girls. The cockney dia
lect character of Mrs.- Stead was taken by
Mlhs Ida Krueger, who was the right per
son in the right part. The comedy ran
remarkably smooth for its first night.
"Alabama" follows next week.
Orpheum.
The bill at the Orpheum this week is
more than usually attractive. The house
last night was crowded and the applause
was unstinted. Camilla Urso, the cele
lirated violiniste, met with an enthusiastic
j.,n, Slie was recalled three times,
:ind even then the audience wanted more.

popularity.
Columbia.
"Gayest Manhattan," with new special
ties, will continue as the attraction at the
Columbia Theater this week.
Next Monday night will see a revival of
Evans & Hoej^s famous farcical success,
'A Parlor Match." The piece this season
is said to be presented by quite an array
of clever people, including Mark Sullivan,
J. W. Kingsky. Edith Hoyt, J. W. Gall
away, Tom Browne, William Ware.
California.
"A Boy Wanted" Is attracting crowded
houses to the California Theater, and its
entertaining specialties are winning favor.
The farce will remain up to and including
Saturday night. Next Sunday America's
representative Irish comedian, Dan Sully,
will inaugurate a limited engagement,
playing for the first time in this city at
popular prices.
The Tivoli.
The Tivoli's creditable production of
"Cyrano de Bergerac" attracted another
good-sized audience last night. Edwin
Stevens' work in the title part won nu
merous calls. The performance is smooth
er than ever now, and will be continued
throughout the week.

Press Club Benefit.
The fifth annual benefit entertainment
of the Press Club of San Francisco will
be held at the Columbia Theater on
Thursday afternoon. The occasion prom
ises to be an event. The entertainment
committee has spared no pains to insure
an excellent programme. All of the
theaters have very kindly volunteered to
assist, and there will be no dearth of tal
ent. Among the attractions will be the
International Opera Company, "Gayest

Tivoli, artists from the New Comedy, Mo

And besides these selections by Signor
Rafael Meany, the pianist, and Signor
Vargas, the barytone.
The Chutes.
Maud Gage, a whistler with excellent
tone and technique, made a hit at the
Chutes Free Theater last evening, as did
also Omne, a little Japanese woman, who
presents some clever illusions. The rest
of the programme was well received, and
a new moving picture, the "Astronomer's
Dream," created a sensation.
Olympia.
Forman and Howlett, banjoists, scored
a hit at the Olympia Music Hall last
night and Emily Scheindle, the Austra

feats. There are ten other acts on the
bill.

PARIS. Dec. s.â At a meeting held to
night under the auspices of the Patriotic
League, the most violent anti-Dreyfus or
ganization in Paris, MM. Millevoye and
De Roulede declared that the time had
arrived to pass from words to acts.
The audience thereupon started to
march to the Cherche Midi Prison, where j
Colonel Picquart is confined. The police j
interfered, whereupon the "patriots" |
made for a meeting being held by the ad- !
vocates of revision. A collision occurred, â¢
revolvers were fired and one man was â¢
wounded.
M. de Roulede's frantic followers con- j
tinued the parade, shouting, "Vive l'Ar

they reached the Strasbourg monument,
where they were finally dispersed.
HIGHBINDERS IN AUBURN.
Merchant- Ah Yee May Have Been
Slain by His Countrymen.
AUBURN, Dec. s.â No definite clew
has yet been found in the case of Ah
Yee, the wealthy Chinese merchant,
who was literally chopped to pieces
with an ax last Friday night. Report
says there were three highbinders in
town a couple of weeks ago, and on
Friday afternoon Embry Sutton and
Chris Michaels, miners who were sell
ing their gold dust, observed two Chi
nese engaged m a heated conversation
with Ah Yee as they entered the store.
The veteran gold buyer was endoavor
ing to pacify his angry cousins by the
aid of a book and some figures he had
in his hand.
The Coroner's Inquest was held to
day, but the testimony did not develop
anything. Public Administrator Mitch
ell will to-morrow commence a thor
ough search of the dead merchant's
store, believing that the murderers did
not find all of his money and that he
had it hidden in many places.

GOVERNOR BUDD
MAKES FOUR
APPOINTMENTS
Col. Park Henshaw
Gets a Place.
NOTARIES PUBLIC NAMED
TALK ABOUT THE VACAKT
JUDGESHIP.
A List of the Probable Appointments
to Be Made by Attorney Gen
eral-Elect Tirey I*
Ford.
Yesterday was Governor Budd's busy
day. Besides making four appointments
he received innumerable callers and lis
tened to suggestions without end con-
cernlng other appointments that are to \
be made between now and the close ol i
his term of office.
The appointments madÂ© were of two
members of the State Board of Agricul
ture and two notaries public. Frederick
Cox, one of the present members of the
Board of Agriculture, was appointed to
succeed himself. The other appointment
is that of Colonel Park Henshaw of Chi
co. lie is named to succeed J. E. Terry,
one of the present members of the board
whose term has expired.
George A. Patterson was commissioned
a notary public for the city and county of
San Francisco, vice A. J. Porter, term
expired. Eugene W. Levy of this city re
ceived a renewal of his commission as
notary public.
Governor Budd has not yet decided whom
he will name as the successor of Judge
Rhodes Borden, whose sudden death- a
few days ago created a vacancy on tho
Superior Court bench in this city. Tho
contention that L. C. Pistolesi, who re
ceived the highest number of votes for
the unexplred term of Superior Judge.will
continue to hold office until the general
election, is not considered worthy of a
moment's consideration. In a majority of
instances a State officer is qualified by
law to hold office until his successor Is
elected and qualified. Such is not the
case, however, in the matter of Superior
Court Judges.
The constitution expressly states that
they shall be elected for a specified
term, no qualification being made re
garding their successors. Judge Borden
having been elected for the ensuing six
years his death creates a vacancy that
can only be filled by appointment by the
Governor.
While much speculation is being In
dulged regarding who will be selected as
the successor of the lftf.e Judge Borden,
it Is the general belief that W. P. Lawle*
will be the lucky man.
What with the stress of official and
political business Governor Budd is hav
ing a hard time trying to get leisure In
which to prepare his final message to the
Legislature. Adjutant General A. W.
Barrett is lending the Governor valuable
assistance, but applications for political
jobs, petitions for pardons and special
pleas of all kinds are coming in so thick
that even the usually level-headed veteran
Is losing his presence of mind. He says
his trials are greater now than during tho
hardest struggles of the late unpleasant
ness with Spain, and threatens to leave
the Chief Executive to fight it out alone.
The following will no doubt be named
to make up the staff of assistants in the
office of Attorney General-elect Tlrey L.
Ford:
Assistant, C. N. Post of Sacramento;
first deputy, George A. Sturtevant of
Ukiah; second deputy. William M. Abbott
of San Francisco; third deputy, A. A.
Moore of Oakland; stenographer, George
Francis of Los Angeles; clerks, Charles
P. Gale of Oroville and Kate V. Hannon
of Sausalito.
BOULEVARD CONTRACTS LET.
Supervisors Refuse to Change the
Route of the Tiburon Road.
SAN RAFAEL. Dec. 6.â The Board of
Supervisors awarded the construction of
sections 1 and 2 of the Tiburon boulevard
to Jesse Colwell and section 3 to Lunny &
Redmond at to-days session. A number of
property-owners from Sausalito and Mill
Valley were present and urged the board
to postpone action until something could
be done toward changing the route, but
after some discussion the board voiced its
opinion that the route as selected was the
only feasible one. It expressed a willing
ness to build a connecting road from Mill
Valley and Sausalito whenever the right
of way could be obtained and an appro
priation granted.
DON LUIS ARGUELLO DEAD.
Passing of a Descendant of an Old
Spanish Family.
SAN JOSE, Dec. s.â Don Luis Arguello,
one of the best known residents of this
county, died at his home In Santa Clara
at an early hour this morning. He leaves
a family of grown children and a large
estate, though much of this has been
deeded to the children. He was a native
of California, aged 68 years. He came
from one of the old Spanish families and
was noted for his hospitality, which was
upon a lavish scale.
CAPITALIST'S OFFENSE.
Larkspur Citizen Convicted of Hav
ing Obstructed a Highway.
ROSS STATION, Dec. 6.â C. W. Wright
of Larkspur, president of the American
Land and Trust Company, was found
guilty to-day In Judge Rodden's court of
a misdemeanor. Wright obstructed a
fiublic highway by building a fence across
t. Wright gained notoriety here two
years ago By building a barn on the
Misses Browns' property and having it
guarded night and day. The Misses Brown
engaged the services of ex-Marshal Creed,
and after a struggle with Wright and his
guards succeeded In removing the barn
from the property.

Command That Books of Original
Entry and Memoranda Belating to
Price of Marble Be Produced
at 10:30 a. m. To-Day.
M. J. Hawley, general manager of the
Vermont Marble Company, Is considering
whether his firm will or will not respect
the power and dignity of the State Sen-
I ate. He was requested yesterday by Sen
ator John H. Dickinson, chairman of the
Senate committee appointed to investigate
public institutions, to produce before- said
committee all the memoranda, data and
books of original entry in his possession
concerning amounts secured on account
of marble supplied to Contractor C. F.
McCarthy and used in the construction of
the ferry building.
Mr. Hawley was called before the com
mittee as the contractor's witness to dis
prove the estimates of Expert Reid re
garding the finish and cost of the marble j
in the grand nave. It was the contrac- |
tor's purpose to prove by the witness that |
marble to the value of $20,000 was supplied j
and used. Direct inquiries and cross
questions disclosed the fact that the speci
fications were revised, and so Mr. Haw
ley for the instant could not call to mind
all the details involved. Replying to ques
tions put by Senator Dickinson, Manager
Hawley testified:
"Our company estimated on the origi
nal contract. The estimate was made on
! memoranda brought by Mr. McCarthy. I
| do not think that I ever saw the plans.
I based my figures on data supplied by i
Mr. McCarthy."
Senator Dickinsonâ Have you the figures
on marble wainscoting?
Manager Hawleyâ l have the figures on
I the entire work.
A letter bearing the date January 23,
! 1896, was produced, which letter set forth
! that the entire marble work would cost
$20,000.
Replying to Contractor McCarthy, Mr.
' Hawley specified the use of other marble
! than that embraced in the estimate of
; $20,000. Among the additions cited were
i side caps for all piers, sockets under the
girder beams, marble covering of arches
and marble trimmings for ticket windows.
Senator Dickinson to Manager Hawley |
âI request you now to produce here all I
the memoranda and data, and also your
books of original entry bearing on the
prices you received for the marble sup
i plied. If convenient produce them at 10
i a. m. to-morrow.
Manager Hawleyâ l will consider the re-
QU Senator Dickinsonâ When you say, Mr.
Hawley, that you will consider the re
quest do you say it with a knowledge
that the committee was appointed under
a resolution of the Legislature to inves
tigate public institutions?
Manager Hawleyâ No, sir.
Senator Dickinson then explained to
Mr Hawley the powers of the commit
tee and advised him to produce the
books and data requested. The Senator
remarked that failure to comply with
the order of the committee would be re
ported to the Senate.
The chairman consulted his fellow-
Senators, Prlsk and Boyce, and after the
consultation put these questions to Mr.
Hawley: ' :
Senator Dickinsonâ Are you general
manager of the Vermont Marble Com
pany?
Manager Hawleyâ Yes, sir.
Senator Dickinsonâ Were you the gen
eral manager when the marble was sup
plied?
Manager Hawleyâ Yes, sir.
Senator Dickinsonâ On behalf of the
committee 1 request you to produce here
at 10:30 a. m. to-morrow all the memor
anda, data and the original books of en
try in your possession bearing on the
marble supplied, In order to get at all
the details.
F. J. Brandon was subsequently di
rected to Issue the subpena in regular
form.
William Cronan, contractor for roofilng,
skylights and galvanized iron, was on the
witness stand for two hours of the after
noon session. He replied to questions put
by his attorney, E. B. Young. The vari
ous allowances and deductions embraced |
in the report of James W. Reid, the ex
pert, were taken up and considered.
In the cost of painting iron there was
a wide difference between the prices as
given by Mr. Cronan and the figures of
the expert. The square feet of surface
estimated by the witness largely exceed
ed the area computed by the expert. Mr.
Cronan testified that he never did any
painting for less than one cent a square
foot. Much of the painting of the depot
had to be done with a small brush.
At the morning session F. A. Kantitz,
civil engineer, and Clarence Musto, a
marble dealer, were witnesses on behalf
of Contractor McCarthy.

DR. TERWAGNE LOST
IN ALASKAN WILDS
Aeronaut Who Started to Search for
Andree Believed to Have
Perished.
VANCOVER, B. C, Dec. s.â According |
to a letter received here from the north
yesterday by the steamer Dirigo Dr. Ter
wagne, the French scientist who intended
hunting for Andree with a balloon in
Northern Alaska, and several of his party
are lost. Terwagne left here several
months ago and went to Skaguay. His
balloon did not arrive, and he started
with several of his party for Dawson,
which he reached. After a short stay
there he staked or bought claims on Do
minion Creek.
Over a month ago he started to come
out, two of his party accompanying him.
Since that time not a trace of them has
been discovered. They had a small sup
ply of provisions and no hope is held out i
for them. They were "tenderfeet" of the '
most pronounced type and would have ;
starved when hardy miner* would have j
lived.
Terwagne is a noted aeronaut. He was |
corresponding for a number of French j
scientific papers. He came here direct
from Paris.

Senator Morgan Expresses Confidence
That the Bill Will Pass
Congress.
"WASHINGTON, Dec. s.â Senator Mor
gan is greatly pleased with the President's
recommendations concerning the Nlca- i
ragua Canal. He said to The Call cor
respondent to-night that ha would call
the bill up early and he had not doubt
of its passage.
Notwithstanding the fact that some of
the Republican leaders In both the House
and Senate are at loggerheads over this
question, certain leaders have resolved
that no bill shall be considered over which
there is likely to be an extended discus
sion. Senator Allison is one of these and
Dingley of Maine is another. But it is
the general opinion thai the canal bill will
go through. The President's failure to
mention the Bulwer-Clayton treaty signi
fies that he wants Congress to go ahead
regardless of the treaty, which is held
by some to mean Joint construction of
the canal by Great Britain and the United
States.
WATER SUPPLY SHTTT OFF.

GALLAGHER CALLED DOWN
SCHOOL DIRECTORS DEFIED THE
GRAND JURY.
Noe Valley School Lot Deal Again
Brought xnto Prominence by
the Searchlight of Jury
man Irving.
The Grand Jury met again last evening
to give further consideration to the du
bious doings of the Board of Education,
and the little row that has been on for the
past week between S. C. Irving, chairman
of the school committee of the jury, and
Director E. J. Gallagher was given a
pretty thorough airing.
A few days ago Irving applied by letter
to Gallagher for certain facts in connec
tion with the Finance Committee of the
Board of Education, of which Gallagher
is the chairman, and for answer he got
a curt refusal to comply with any requisi
tion made by Irving personally. Irving
notified the jury, and Chairman J. D. Me-
Kee communicated with Judge Belcher,
who sent to the jury the following terse
communication: >
SAX FRANCISCO. Dec. 5, IS9S.
Gentlemen of the Grand Jury: I understand
that there is some friction between Mr. Gal
lagher of the School Department and Mr. Irv
ing chairman or the school committee of your
body, and that Mr. Gallagher refuses to permit
Mr " Irvine and lilt- authorized assistants to
inspect the School Department records without
the authority of the Grand Jury for that pur
pose. * - - Â£<
You must stand by Mr. Irving. He Is doing
his work faithfully and his efforts have my
entire approval. 1 assume that Mr. Irving has
already your authority to proceed, as he is
chairman of the school committee, but If there
is any doubt about It you will reauthorize him,
with "the fullest power*, to proceed with the
examination Into the proceedings of the School
Department and matters pertaining thereto
that you have under investigation. it Mr.
Irving meets with -any further obstruction he
will make an affidavit setting forth the facts,
and will report to your grand body and your
grand body will at once report to me In open
court. Â«.Â«.Â«Â«Â»
The matters pertaining to the School De
partment 1 expressly submitted to. you in my
charge, and later In a communication, and I
shall not be patient with any obstruction to
the fullest examination by your grand body or
any authorized member thereof.
1 expressly direct you not to take up any ,
new business whatever, but to devote your |
active time to the School Department matters, i
â  Very respectfully.
EDWARD A. BEI>CHER, Presiding Judge, j
Pursuant to the instructions of Judge
Belcher, Chairman McKee issued the fol
lowing mandate to Charles L.. Barring
ton, president of the Board of Education:
Dec. 3. 1S&Â£"
Charles L. Barrington Esq.. President Hoard ]
of Educationâ Sir: The Grand Jury of!
the city and county of San Francisco, now in !
session, is in receipt of a communication from |
F J Gallagher declining to furnish certain j
Information in regard to the financial condition
of the Board of Education to B. C. Irving,
chairman of the Grand Jury committee on the
Hoard of Education, on the ground that the
request did not come from the Grand Jury.
You will hereby take notice that Mr. Irving
has the fullest authority to act for this Grand
Jury in matters portainins to the Board of
Education investigation.
The officers and employes of the Board or
Education are hereby Instructed by resolution
of this Grand Jury to furnish to Mr. Irving
all data and Information requested by him, and
particularly the information requested by him
in his letter of December 1. addressed to E. J.
Gallagher, chairman of the finance committee
of the Board of Education, demand for which la
hereby renewed. Yours truly,
J. I*. JicKhb,
Foreman Grand Jury of the City and County
of San Francisco.
President McKee's letter had. the effect
of bringing about a more apparent feeling
of co-operation on the part of the rampant
Gallagher and Mr. Irving has so far pro
gressed with his investigation that he was
last evening able to report to the jury
that the actual shortage that will face
the new Board of Directors foots up
$271,843 70. â  .>,.w,:
The investigation of the jury has again
brought into prominence the Noe Valley
School lot deal. No announcement has
ever been made that the lot had been
bought and the matter had dropped out of
mind until Mr. Irving discovered that a
warrant for $12,000, drawn in payment of
the absurd price that was asked for the
property, had reached the Auditor's of
fice. Irving immediately sought Superin
tendent Webster and Deputy Stone, whose
signatures were necessary to make the
â warrant operative, and both of them de
nied having signed it. He has not deter
mined yet whether or not the warrant has
got into the Auditor's hands without be
ing signed, but if it has it is a forgery
upon the word of the two men. whose sig-
' natures it is supposed to bear.-
Just what the teachers will gain by any
suit they may bring against the Directors
to enforce the payment of their November
salaries is not clear -to see. as Professor
Kllpatrick's report shows that up to Oc
tober 31 the department had spent $.".8,000
of the $600,000 that is allowed for the half
years' expenses, leaving a balance on
hand of $42,000 with which to liquidate
two months' salaries and about $80,000 of
euddlv bills.
TO GUARD LIFE AND PROPERTY
Real Estate Owners'. Association Dis
cusses Facilities for Protection
From Fire.
Improved facilities for the protection of
life and property from fire was the sub
ject of discussion before the Real Estate
Owners' Association last evening. The
meeting was one of the results of the
Baldwin fire and E. J. Baldwin was pres
ent to answer the questions of the mem
bers.
Mr. Baldwin-stnfpd that by reason of his
recent experience he was convinced that
this city is far from being adequately pro
tected against great conflagrations. He
thought there should be from four to
Fix additional water towers and expressed
the belief that it these flooding machines
had been available at the Baldwin fire the
greater portion of the building would have
been saved.
In the course of these criticisms of the
Fire Department ho asserted that during
the fire only one stream was played upon
the Mark<-t-street side of the hotel and
that litt'.e benefit was derived therefrom.
The attention of Mr. Baldwin was call
ed to the fact that there was a marked
scarcity of water after the department
had settled flown to hard work and that
additional water towera would have been
of no particular value. He acknowledged
the truth of the proposition and that the
mains of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany, even in the most important portions
of the city, were inadequate to supply
water to properly tight a big tire.
The meeting Indorsed bis conclusion and
there was a general discussion of the
bent means to obtain the desired results
As a preliminary step a committee con
sisting of C. S. Young, Dr. C. S. Mann
and J. H. .Speck, was appointed to com
muiilcan- with the proper authorities in
large Eastern and foreign cities for the
purpose >>f learning the most approved
methods employed for the protection of
life and property.
An Important meeting of the association
will be held next Tuesday night at which
the conduct of the Fire Department and
Board of Kducatlon will be investigated
Highbinders Must Pay.
Lieutenant Price has put a stop to the
tree list tit the Chinese theaters which
have recently reopened, and hereafter
highbinders must pay the fiddler or not
dance. Heretofore all the hatchet men
had to do was to present themselves at
the door and they were admitted without
paying, the doorkeepers and managers
Tearing if they refused admittance that
trouble wnu.d result. A large proprotion
of the past murders have occurred in the
theateri ;ind the guilty ones were those
on the free list. Lieutenant Price hopes
In this manner to partially avoid blood
shed. The highbinders have become so
scarce in Chinatown that the special
squad has been relieved from duty during
the early evening, but after 12 o'clock at
night the force Is doubled and a vigilant
watch kept for bad Chinese.
RESIGNED HIS KEY.
Death of James S. McGinnis, the Pop-
ular Telegrapher.
James S. McGinnis, the well-known and
popular telegrapher, died at the residence
of his sister, Mrs. A. Beede, 118 A Noe
street, this city, shortly after noon yester
day, after an illness lasting but five days.
Mr. McGinnis was. at the time of his ill
ness, a trusted employe of the Western
I'nion Telegraph Company at Its main
.office in this city. His health was appar
ently the best up to last Wednesday after
noon, when he complained of a slight in
disposition and later was compelled to go
home. Shortly after reaching home he
was seized with a violent hemorrhage,
from which he rallied in a measure, but
this was followed by two more hemor
lhnges, the last one of which proved to be
too much of a tax on his strength. Ho
gradually sank until yesterday noon,
whi-ii death released htm from his suffer-
ing.
Mr. McGinnis was well known through
out the United States as an expert tele
grapher. ;ih wt'll as a genial and popular
member of the craft. He has worked at
his profession In Chicago and New York,
as well as in San Francisco and other
principal cities.
He occupied the position of night chief
operator for the Postal Telegraph Com
pany when that company opened its office
in this city. The funeral services will be
held at St. Dominic's Church at 10 a. m.,
Wednesday. Interment at Holy Cross
cemetery.
DOG POISONERS
AGAIN AT WORK
CHAMPION DICK SWIVELER THE
LATEST VICTIM.
Two Valuable Canines Are Already-
Dead and Another Is
Dying.
Dog poisoners are abroad again and
owners of valuable canines are warned to
be on their guard to preserve the lives of
their pets. Within the past week at least
three dogs of more than ordinary worth
have been sacrificed to gratify some mis
creant or miscreants who seem to take
delight in assassinating dumb brutes. Two
are dead and the third is In a dying con
dition.
Dick Swiveler, the Elcho kennel's cham
pion Irish setter and the winner of innu
merable prizes, a dog valued at $2500, is
i the latest victim of the poisoner. Dick
Swiveler came from a family of prize
winners and had a pedigree as long as
the Prince of Wales. He died yesterday
from the effects of poison administered
by some person whose identity is not
known, fortunately for him. Three days
ago a valuable collie, belonging to a Span
iard living in the rear of 1!22 Post street,
died of arsenical poisoning, and next door
a shepherd and spitz is slowly dying of
poison. The latter is owned by L,'. Bara
das. Three months ago Mr. B&radas lost
a brother to the dug. The brute was given
I a fried sponge filled with powdered glass
d died in great agony.
This neighborhood seems to be a favor
â¢ Held for the dog poisoning wretch.
Two weeks ago Lion, the magnificent St.
Bernard belonging to Charles Newman,
proprietor of the Richelieu, who lives at
424 Post street, was poisoned and only
prompt and intelligent efforts saved his
life.
While no direct accusations are made
It is believed the scoundrel who is appar-
By seeking to wipe out the canine pop
ion i.f the neighborhood is a neigh
and a detective may be employed to
te the guilty party. Should the" effort
be successful the culprit, whether man or
woman, will be given the full benefit of
the law.

"GIGGLES" PLAY HAVOC
WITH ALCAZAR STARS
Why Miss Gretchen Lyons Received
"Two Weeks' Notice" and Ernest
Hastings Resigned.
THERE is soon to be a new leading lady at the Alcazar; also a new
leading man.
Miss Gretchen Lyons received a mean, hateful note from the "front
of the house" Sunday night, giving her the customary two weeks' no
tice that her services would be dispensed with after that date. Yesterday
the "front of the house" received a curt note from Mr. Ernest Hastings,
stating that he would sever his connection with the theater in two weeks!
And thereby hangs a tale; a tale of midnight suppers and midday ex
cursions to the park and Cliff and other haunts of pleasure seekers; of de
layed rehearsals, half memorized lines, an angry management, complain
ing patrons andâ a chronic case of stage giggles, whatever that may be.
Such in brief is the condition of affairs. Miss Lyons delighted Alca
zar audiences for many weeks with her charming acting and her even
more charming personal attractions. Then that attack of "stage giggles"
came on and the audiences grew tired. At least that's what Mr. Charles
Bryant says, and he, being the stage manager, surely ought to know.
It seems that these "giggles" wore most pronounced when Mr. Hastings
strode on r. v. c., dashed through the window 1. or crawled from behind
the portieres c. c. Whenever the two occupied the stage those giggles were
sure to come on. and the audience, not understanding, registered "kicks"
innumerable at the box office. Then, too, there was the trouble at rehear
sals, with the two leading people coming in half or an hour late, or. may
be, overlooking the little business arrangement altogether. At first ex
cuses and apologies were accepted, but after a time the infractions be
came so frequent it was deemed necessary to administer rather pointed re
bukes, for such constant slighting of rehearsals and studying of parts
could only result In awkward breaks on the stage that necessitated quick
witted "faking" on the part of the two delinquents to fill In the gaps. This
would not have been so bad had It not been that this "faking" degener
ated into "joshing." pure and simple, in which the audience was quite apt
to be made the butt of the merry jeÃters, and Invariably brought on an
attack of "giggles."
The climax was reached Sunday, when Miss Lyons was fined $25 for
being late at rehearsal and not having become letter perfect in her part in
"The Private Secretary." Miss f.yons "kicked" in the only way a lalv
can kick, of course. She thought it was too mean for anything to fine her
and she Just wouldn't pay i:, po there! That kick is what brought forth
the note from the manager's office, and now that it is too late she's sorry
she kicked.
When Mr. Hastings heard of Miss Lyons' dismissal, which he did as
soon as the lady had an opportunity to impart the information, great
was his wrath, which grew with each succeeding hour until it broke forth
yesterday in his note of resignation.
Miss Lyons was about to go on the stage last evening when she was
asked if it were true she was soon to terminate her engagement at the
Alcazar.
"I have been thinking about it," she naively replied, "but it Is not defi
nitely decided yet. I shall make up my mind in a day or two an I will let
you know."
Pretty, ingenuous Gretchen. Andat that moment, probably. Manager
Thall's note was lying on her dressing table. But Miss Lyons is an act
ress, you know.
"Yes, it is true I have resigned," said Mr. Hastings five minutes later.
"I don't care to go into Retails, but it is Just a little disagreement behind
stage. My relations with the front of the house are, and have been, most
harmonious. I Bhall finish my two weeks here and then go East."
Possibly Miss Lyons will also go East and Join her husband, Lucius
Henderson, who is a member of a Milwaukee stock company.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1898.
OPENED THE
BIG BAZAAR
WITH MUSIC
The Pavilion Greets
the Charitable.
BOOTHS READY FOR BUSINESS
ARTISTIC AND USEFUL ARTI
CLES OFFERED FOR SALE.
Afternoon Is Given Over to Hundreds
of School Children, Who Are
Guests of the Man
agement.
The Charity Bazaar and grand musical
contest for the benefit of the charitable
Institutions and orphan asylums of San
Francisco was formally opened in Me
chanics' Pavilion last night with a musi-
cal programme of unusual excellence.
While the attendance was not as large as
was anticipated the managers are by no
means discouraged, as they are confident
that as the full scope of the fair and its
purposes, together with the many attrac
tive features it contains, becomes more
fully known, the public will respond in a
manner to Insure the success of the pro
ject. As the bazaar will be open until the
first of the new year there will be plenty
of time for the public to become familiar
with the advantages it offers for an even
ing's entertainement and to aid in pro
moting a worthy cause.
The five hundred people who visited the
Pavilion last evening were more than re
paid for their trouble, aside from the con
cert. The entire main floor space is oc
cupied by booths, all of which, with but
few exceptions, are open and doing busi
ness, alia in which anything from a pin
cushion to a piano or a four-horse coach
may be purchased. During the day a
number of exhibits which were among the
features of the Oakland exhibition, just
closed, were placed In position, and more
of the same kind will follow. The booths
are prettily decorated and the exhibits
arranged, in an attractive and artistic
manner.
The feature of last night's concert was
a piano solo by Mrs. Noah Brandt, wife of
the leader of the orchestra. Mrs. Brandt is
an accomplished artiste, and while her
talent has long been recognized by her
friends and in amateur circles this was
her first public appearance. She scored
a decided hit and was enthusiastically en
cored.
Mist> Nina Ch. de St. Hubert directed
the orchestra in the rendition of a patri
otic march, "Greater America," composed
by herself, and wielded the baton with a
skill that called forth enthusiastic ap
plause from the audience.
In the afternoon the Pavilion swarmed
with children from the public schools,
who were present on the invitation of the
management. The little ones enjoyed
themselves thoroughly, and it is proposed
to throw open the doors of the bazaar
every afternoon to the young folks from
the various schools, orphan asylums and
other institutions of a like character. A
free Punch and Judy show will also be
given dally for their benefit in the bal
cony at 4 "p. m. Brandt's orchestra will
also give a concert every afternoon as
well as in the evening.
The management announces that a
large number of donations have already
been received to be sold for the benefit of
tho charity fund, and more are coming
da!ly.
One hundred and sixty exhibitors oc
cupy Space on the floors of the Pavilion,
and* as the amount received from thorn for
rents, as well as a commission on all sales

TWO COUPLES SPLICEP AT SEA.
Father and Daughter Ta*_e Respec
tively Wire and Husband.
Two couples- with love in their hearts
and a profound intention to abide by the
regulations of matrimony sought the as
sistance of Captain Wilson of the launch
Amy last Thursday. The kind and gra
cious captain steamed out to sea, and
after tying the knots and dissipating tem
porarily their earthly tribulations,
steamed back again and set them on terra
firma at the foot of Folsom street. It is
known that all four were from San Jose,
and to make the circumstances a little
more romantic, one of the girls who took
unto herself a protector was the daughter
of the man who played the principal part
in the other ceremony, and who by this
operation secured for the aforesaid young
bride another mother. The girl's name is
Mis.-. Hilton, and the name she bears to
day is Swett It is said that young Swett's
parents objected to his marriage with
Miso Hilton, and he took this means of
eliminating any disagreeable features
which might have happened on shore.
WALKED OFF THE DOCK.
John Fitzgerald Drowned at Spear-
Street Wharf While at Work.
John Fitzgerald, a machinist, walked off
the dock at Spear street la-st evening and
was drowned In the *my before assistance
could reach him. . Captain Henry Peter
son and several others immediately be
gan to drag the bay for the body, but up
to a late hour their efforts had been un
successful.
The accident occurred at the California
drydock, where Fitzgerald was engaged
in repairs on the steamer Morgan City.
Several of the workmen saw Fitzgerald
walk from the dock, but before .they could
reach him he had disappeared from sight.
Fitzgerald was about 22 years old. He
was employed as a machinist by the Rls
don Iron Works, with which company he
learned his trade. He leaves a father,
mother and two sisters.
THEATER AND

DROWNED AT LANDS END.
Lester Lewis Meets Death While Out
Fishing.
The dead body of Lester Ward Lewis was
found on the rocks at Lands End station
yesterday afternoon by Chris Erlcksen of
the Golden Gate life-saving station. The
young man was drowned last Saturday
while fishing for mussels, and his death
was accidental.
Lewis left his home at 2321 Pine street
last Saturday to go mussel hunting. When
he failed to return Sunday his mother ue
came anxious, and fearing he was
drowned sent friends to look for his body.
Harry Lewis, a brother of the deceased,
and Sergeant H. M. Burke, Company 11
i of the Sixth California Regiment, spent all
! day yesterday in a fruitless search for
i the body. The Coroner was notified of
Lewis' disappearance, and as soon as the
body was recovered word was sent to the
family and the remains were taken to the
home of the bereaved mother.
â Lewis was 1" years of age, and up to
the time of his death was employed as a
clerk for the Union Fish Company. It Is
believed that while fishing for mussels
he slipped on the rocks, and being unable
to swim was drowned.
Beaten by Footpads.
"While Jerry Kivak^nburgh, cook on the
schooner Free Trade, was piloting his
way along on the water front about half
past 11 o'clock last night he was attacked
by two footpads in the vicinity of Main
and Harrison streets. The larger of the
men caught him around the neck while
the other struck him with seme blunt im
plement. The sailor called for help, but
just as he did so a Harrison-street car
came in sight and the footpads, fearing
capture, lied in the darkness. The In
jured man was taken to the Receiving
Hospital and his wounds, which consisted
of several severe cuts and abrasions about
the head, were dressed by Doctors Hill
and Zabala. After Kivakenburgh left the
hospital he gave a description of his a;*
sa Hants to Sergeant Cullom and Detective
Dillon, who believe that the men are the
same ones who have committed several
similar crimes in this city during the past
week or two. One man was tall and his
companion rather short.

you will have no further use for others.*
A Boy Wanted.
P. Sloan, an employe of the Rlsdon Iron
Works, residing at 522 Howard street,
notified the police that his little son, aged
10 and one half years, has been missing
from home since Sunday morning. The
boy wore a blue blouse witn white spots,
gray pants and a cap with gold-colored
band. His father has no clew to his
whereabouts.
A MIXING-HOUSE
IN RUINS
111 IIUIIIU
Continued from Pa^e.
lifted and sent in all directions with
other parts of the structure.
Of the bodies of the six men who con
stituted the w. rking force of the plant
scarcely a vestige could be found.
They, too, had shared in the terrible
rending asunder which put everything
connected with the place absolutely be
yond all possible recognition. Stray
remnants of arms and limbs began to
be discovered as soon as search was
made among the ruins. One or two of
the Chinamen were found in a fearfully
mutilated condition and their remains
were placed in rudely constructed cof
fins and turned over to the Coroner.
But of Charles Kennedy, the superin
tendent, almost nothing is left. Por
tions of the remains, recovered later,
show traces of a white skin, and this is
all that could be regained from the
ruins last night, though a renewed
search in daylight may produce more.
This is not the first time the Judson
Powder Works has lost this same plant
through explosion. Early in October
a former structure was destroyed and
two men, James Anderson and Peter
Roche, were killed. Since then the
plant has been rebuilt and was put into
working order about three weeks ago.
It is said that Superintendent Ken
nedy was the only man whom the com
pany could obtain to take charge of the
new works. All others feared to ven
ture upon the hazardous undertaking,
after the long record of fatalities it had
caused.
With the five Chinamen and an as
sistant named Butterworth Kennedy
started to get the plant into running
order again. It was necessary to in
struct the new men in the methods of
handling the explosiY.es, and it was
while engaged in doing this that the
explosion occurred.
Butterworth's escape was almost mi
raculous. A minute or so previous to
the explosion he was in the building
with Kennedy and the five Chinamen.
sharing in the superintendent's in
struction. For some reason or other he
stepped outside and started to cross the
field to another building some distance
away. It was but the question of a
few seconds, and the last moment had
come for those he had just left. He saw
the structure with its inmates go up
into the air, and was forced to dodge
in order to escape the. showering
wreckage.
Charles D. Kennedy, the superintend
ent of the works, was one of the best
known clubmen of Alameda County.
He was a graduate of the State Uni
versity and one of the resident mem
bers of the Athenian Club, having
made its headquarters his home for
some years. His popularity was great,
and no Bohemian or social gathering
was complete without him. He was al
ways regarded as the embodiment of
honor and his death is cause for deep
sorrow to hundreds of his acquaint
ances.
Kennedy was an expert and thor
oughly understood every branch of his
business. His duty was to exercise
general supervision over the whole of
the works, and it was because of a dif
ficulty in securing a competent man for
foreman of the mixing-house that he
has lately undertaken the task himself.
He has been instructing a young man
named Butterworth in the art of mix
ing niter and glycerin for some time
and by the merest chance his pupil was
not in the house when it blew up.
When F. H. Pitman, secretary of the
powder company, congratulated But
terworth on his fortunate escape, the
latter shook his head and replied that
he regretted that he could not have
gone to his death Instead of Kennedy.
Each workingman volunteered words
of keenest regret for their unfortunate
superior. Pitman made this state
ment:
"I know of no one in whose words
and deeds I would place explicit con
fidence to a greater extent than in those
of Kennedy. He was more than the
average man, and we all loved him.
We would have had our works com
pletely destroyed and lost every dollar
on earth if there were such a means
by which fate could have spared him.
His loss is the greatest loss we could
have suffered.
"You may depend on one thing, and
that is that the explosion was not the
result of an accident, for Kennedy was
too careful to allow an accident to oc
cur. Everything was going all right so
far as human ingenuity could direct
it, but something over whin he had
no control must have happened, and
you know the remainder of the story."
Perhaps there is no one upon whom
the blow fell with more force and ac
companying sorrow than Edward G.
Lukens, president of the Judson Pow
der Company. Deceased had been con
nected with the Judson Company as
superintendent of the works ever since
they were opened in 1891.
"Mr. Kennedy was a most efficient
superintendent," said President Lu
kens. "Prior to his superintendency
over these works he held a similar posi
tion at the works of the California Vig
oral Powder Company, at California
City, Marin County, when I was presi
dent of that company. He had been
working around powder ever since 1884.
He never experienced an explosion of
any character in California City, nor
until the explosion last October and
the present one. He was one of the
most careful, efficient and reliable men
in his line on the corst; than him there
were none superior, either personally,
professionally or in any other way.
"Mr. Kennedy was formerly first
lieutenant in the United States rev
enue marine service. He had also
served in the marine service on the
Atlantic coast, and while thus en
gaged his heroism in saving the lives
of passengers on a wreck off the
coast of Massachusetts was rewarded
by a gold medal voted to 'htm by Con
gress. He was a navigating officer at
the time, and during a terrific storm
braved the high sea and went to the
rescue of the drowning people.
"Mr. Kennedy was a single man, a
native of New Bedford, Mass., where
his mother lives. A married sister and
a brother, John C. Kennedy, reside In
Boston, the latter being connected with
Carter, Rice & Co., the big paper firm
of that city. Another brother, Michael
Kennedy, is connected with I. To
briner, the druggist, at Seventh and
Market streets, this city."

JOTMACpECUS
A Noted Physician Will Prove
This to Sufferers in San
Francisco Thursday.
The progress of modern medical sci-
ence has led to the discovery of suc-
cessful methods of treatment for most
of those maladies once regarded as
incurable. Asthma has always been
regajded as belonging to this obstinate
class baffling the skill of the greatest
physicians. Thousands of sufferers
know by their own experience that Jlt-
tle, if any, relief, has been afforded
them by the methods heretofore em-
ployed. Dr. Rudolph Schtffmann, the
noted physician, has, after a life-long
study of Asthma and kindred diseases,
discovered a remedy which not only
gives instant relief in the severest
cases of Asthma, Hay Fever and Bron-
chitis, but has actually cured thou-
sands whose cases had been pronounc-
ed incurable. So complete is his con-
fidence in his remedy, that to over-
come the skepticism of the public
growing out of the failure of other
remedies. Dr. Schiffmann requests this
paper to announce that all day Thurs-
day, Dec. Bth, he offers a liberal sample
box of "Schiffmann's Asthma Cure"
free of charge to all persons applying
at Wm. J. Bryan's drug store, 3 New
Montgomery street, under Grand Ho-
tel. He believes that an actual test
will be the most convincing, and in fact
the only, way to overcome the natural
prejudice of thousands of Asthmatics
who have heretofore sought relief in
vain. Persons living out of town will
receive a package free, postpaid, by
writing direct to Dr. R. Schlffmann, 315'
Rosabel St., St. Paul, Minn., before
Dec. 15th, as no free samples can be
obtained after that date. Send simply
your name and address plainly written
on a post card.

HARBOR VIEW'S GHOST.
A Female Apparition That Weekly
Haunts- the Corner of Baker
and Jefferson Streets.
Harbor View is in the fashionâ it has a
ghost. Not one of those make-beliove
kind, in the form of a. -watermelon with
lioles cut for "eyes, nose and mouth, for
the purpose of scaring 1 pedestrians, but
the real thins: that is uncatchable and
appearance weekly, '.The posL
tlreness'of this fact "is attested by a
dozen residents of that section of the city
whose veracity and sobriety have never
teen questioned. The last appearance of
fthe wraith, which, by the way. is in fe
male form, was seen last Friday night
*jnd besides creating a sensation in that
Jiiiiet portion of the city, almost scared
Dave Bonner into hysterics and other
things. --:.- :
A? the clock was striking 9 on that
evening the apparition was espied by
Dave just as he was coming out of the
Coney Island Chowder House,, which is
opposite the Harbor View Gardens. Dave
v.as on his wav home with a can of beer.
As he stepped on the sidewalk he ob
served the fair one standing on the oppo
site- corner garbed in white. He was
6tartled to see a female form at that time
of night and in that neighborhood and he
stepped back into the refreshment place
and called Otto Schwartz and his father,
Charles Schwartz, to the door. They ob
served the woman and then watched the
gallant Dave wend his way toward her
to learn who she was. The apparition evi
dently became frightened, as it moved
along the tall fence with Bonner and his
can in her wake. About seventy-five
yards down the fence the ghost disap
peared as if by magic, and Dave, al
though frightened, had the presence of
mind not to drop the can of foaming
Steam as he rushed back to the saloon.
Aft*>r being relieved of his ague, he told
what had happened. No one accused him
of romancing, as he was corroborated by
the Schwartzs. father and son. Dave
changed his route when he next essayed
his homeward journey.
The residents in the vicinity are on the
lookout for the ghost, but so far it has
not made its reappearance. It is thought.
however, that on Friday night next, the
apparition will again appear.

STILL SOMETHING DUE
AN EXPERT WILL GO OVER THE

He Is Promised Twenty Dollars, but
He Will Have to Take

It is feared that the members of the
Board of Education do not dwell together
in that spirit of brotherly love recom
mended by the canons of fraternity. The
temperature bobs up nnd little flames
break out here and there in the ranks i
when the discussion ie well under way and J
acrimonious references to pa:U errors '
sometimes come tripping from the tongue. !
There were several small heated spells j
last f vening during a special meeting of :
I the beard to straighten out the Mission i
' High School affairs. Contractor James F. i
; Logan has received his money, $123,908 less
1 $30,977, the tail end of the different pay
i ments yet unpaid. Some changes and al
terations were made during the erection
,of the building. Architect Havens holds I
i that the changes cut down the bill, and |
Contractor Logan adheres to the idea that j
j one change offsets the other in a beautiful
equipoise. He has been paid from time
to time 75 per cent of the value of the
work completed, and at the final comple
tion Of tho work when he was paid the
last installment he claims that such <ay
ment was equivalent to the acceptance of
the building. The board says no, and
the $30,977 due has not been turned over to
Logan.
Architect Havens, who issued the certi
ficate of completion, sides with the con
tractor. He was asked why he issued the
certificate and he pulled the specifications |
on the board and stopped further inquiry. I
Bantel and Head crossed words with
some warm reference to past extrava- '
gances in school furniture and were !
checked by the chairman.
Mr. Burns moved that an expert be em
ployed at $20 to examine the Mission High
School building and report on the altera
tions made and also on the condition of
the structure. Architect Havens objected i
to an expert going over his work, but not- '.
withstanding his tears 8. H. Kent was
appointed. Havens in his report stated
that the heating apparatus was being put
in very unsatisfactorily and that it was
impossible to have Peck, Williams & Co.
comply with their contract.
After a short discussion as to where
the expert would get his $20 with an empty
school treasury the board adjourned with
the question unsolved.
OFFICIAL INQUIRY INTO
THE WALKER EXPLOSION
DAMAGING FACTS BROUGHT
OUT BY THE INSPECTOB-S.
Assistant Engineer Murray Noticed
a Small Leak in the Seam of
the Steam Drum.
Two Important facts were brought out
by Inspectors of Hulls O. F. Bolles and
J. K. Bulger in the official investigation
yesterday into the cause of the explosion
of the California Navigation and Improve
ment Company's steamer T. C. Walker,
which occurred Sunday morning, Novem-
ber 27, near Fourteen-mile Slough. As
sistant Engineer R. J. Murray, who was
in charge of the vessel on the morning of
the explosion, testified that he depended
on his fireman to test the gaugecock and
note the amount of water in the boilers.
Fireman Cassidy testified that the steam
gauge In the fire room indicated ISO
pounds' pressure although the Walker
was registered for 170 pounds. The admis
sion by Engineer Murray that the top
row of tubes in the starboard wing boiler
had been dry heated and burned out und
that a fusible plug in the back of the
boiler had been entirely melted Is not of
much importance unless the inspectors- de
termine whether It occurred before or af
ter the explosion. If before. It would
show that there was little or no water in
the boilers before the disaster.
The first witness on the stand was Hen
ry Potvin, the pilot of the Walker. Be- j
fore he. went on watch he went down in '
the engine room to have a talk with Chief I
Engineer Watson Henry, who was kli iÂ»-Â«l
In the explosion. He noticed nothing un
usual anU would have seen any new teak
if there bad been any. After leaving Tur- i
ners Landing the steamer backed and
lllled twice, but had not got her usual
rate of speed. He did not hear the safety
valves hinw off. At the last bell the ex- '
plosion came. After ascertaining that the
null of the steamer was all right he pro- i
ceedert to Stockton for assistance, leav
ing the vessel in charge of Captain Schu
ler.
Assistant Engineer Murray was next
sworn. He sain the steam guagp was all :
right at 1, 2 and 3:9) o'clock, though he
did not try the gaugecock, leaving that,
as hn.s been said, to the lireman. Three
inches of water showed In the glass. ;
The engine room steam gauge registt-red '
171 and 172 pounds and the safety valve :
blew off. At seven minutes past 4 the fire
man looked at the feed pump and reduced
Us speed. This would show that there
was plenty of water, but he could not tell
anything about the steam. He had noticed
a small leak in the center of the hori- i
zontal seam on the steam drum, but
thought it trivial. At the end of the week
the water in the boilers would get dirty
and the boilers had lifted the water two ;
or throe times on the morning of the ex- i
plosion. The fireman had charge of the '
boilers and the trying of the water in the :
I pump.
The electrician also attended to the oil- J
I ing, as the engineer had other duties to :
I perform.
At this juncture Inspector Bulger asked :
! this pointed question: "If you had an as
sistant could you pay proper attention to
the boilers'.'"
Murray replied: "Yes; th*>re are times
! when you can't leave the engines and you
I must depend on the flrenv n. '
In Murray's opinion, the fusible plug '
i would never have melted had there been
! enough water in the starboard boiler.
Ex-Chief Engineer Charles Sampson ;
testified that salt water was sometimes
usoo" in the boilers, because the tank* did
not always carry enough fresh water to I
make San Francisco. Although the elec
trician was not a licensed man, he con
.sidered him competent to test the water \
In the gauge*. A pressure of 170 pounds
blew on the safety valve.
Fireman Patrick Casstdy went off watch ;
at midnight, and noticed that the steam
drum leaked in the top of the cylinder
seam. It blew considerably when the
Walker was backing and filling. He did j
not notify Engineer Henry, who was on j
the watch, because he supposed he knew !
all about it. On Saturday night, when the ;
steamer was at Black Diamond landing,
the safety valve blew off at ISO on the \
â¢ ;. â ;ira gauge in the fireroom, although he '
had been told by Sampson to carry 170 at
the utmost. The bout was running two
notches over the usual speed, and hÂ»
thought she was a little behind and that 1
v -is the reason for running so hard.
At this point Assistant Engineer Murray â 
asked Casstdy: "Did you ever know me
t <> ask for excessive suam'."' â¢ *â¢ *
The witness replied no. and also that
he understood from Fireman John Canty
that the latter had been reprimanded for
carrying overpressure.'
The investigation will b<Â» resumed this
morning, when Fireman Canty will be
placed on the stand. j

ONCE MORE MENACED BY FIRE.
n I'NDAY morning It was thought the fire on the big American ship
Shenandoah had been put out for good so the old bark Melrose was
\^J brought around from Howard-street wharf to receive part of the coal
cargo. About noon yesterday the fire broke out again and the Melrose had
to be moved away in a hurry while the fire-tug Governor Irwin took her
place and began to pour water on the flames.

half dismantled Mclrose was alongside
taking in ooal as quickly as It could be
hotsted out of the ship, and two donkey
engines were dumping it into hoppers on
the wharf when the second alarm was
given. The tug Governor lrwin was again
called into service, and as soon as the
Mclrose was got out of the way" she
poured two streams of water into the
Shenandoah's hold. _ The fire was in the
fame place as the one that was put out
on Sunday morning, and for a time it
raged furiously-, driving the longshoremen
on deck. During the entire afternoon the
Irwin poured water Into the hold of the

again. The danger is considered over.
W. C. Buckelew was treated at the Har

morning he was found in his room with
the gas turned on. A piece of tubing was
lying beside him, and the supposition Is
that he had fastened one end of it to the
gas jet and put the other in niÂ«< mouth.
About a year ago Buckelew's wife

JOINED THE LABOR COUNCIL.
Paper-Hangers' Union Goes In for
the Strengthening of the Cen

At a meeting of the Paporhangers"
: T'nlon last night officers were elected for
i the ensuing year, and a delegate was also
â  chosen to represent the union in the San
Francisco Labor Council. This is In ac
cordance with the vredlction recently
! made In The Call that unions of the
building trades are about to unite with
the Labor Council and make the strong
est central trades body the city has had
since the old Council of Federated Trades
went to pieces some years ago.
The officers elected are as follows: C.
W. Doyle, president; A. W. Turner, vice
president; Alan Pike, recording secretary;
William McNultv, nnunual secretary: A.
i Fanning, treasurer. Delegates to Build
ing Trades Council, W. Doyle, A. Coburn.
J. W. Rose. Delegate to Labor Council,
Carpenters' Union No. <S3 will hold its
I semi-annual meeting next Monday even-
Ing. Reports will be received from retiring
officers and new officers will be elected.
There is a strong sentiment favorable to
ward sending representatives to the Labor
Council and it is safe to predict that this
will be done.

Accompanied by Sheriff Phillips and De
tectives Charles Cody and Tom Gibson,
Peter McGlade, the defaulting cashier
of the Superintendent of Street's office,
arrived here last night from Peming,
N. M. After embarking from the Oakland
boat the party entered a carriage and was
driven to police headquarters.
McGlade did not appear to be worried,
although he announced that he was fa
tigued on account of the lbng trip. After
a few minutes' conversation with Chief
Lees McGlade asked that he be allowed
to get something to eat, as he was hun
gry. Chief Lees had no objections and
the party went to a neighboring restau
rant and had supper.
The news that the defaulting cashier
had been brought back traveled with as
tonishing rapidity and in a brief space of
time the restaurant was besieged with
friends of the accused man. They advised
him not to speak about the case, and as
sured him that he would not have to suf
fer the consequences of his crime. After
partaking of a hearty meal McGlade was
taken to the City Prison, where he was
formally charged with forgery.
Deputy' Sheriff Fitzgerald, who went to
Port Costa to meet McGlade, remained
with him in the prison for several hours.
McGladc's brother aiso had a long con
versation with him.
The disgraced official refuses to say any
thing for publication.
"I have nothing to tell you," he re
marked to the reporters, who were wait
ing to interview him. "My attorney will
be here to-morrow, and not until then will
l speak of the charges that have been pre
ferred against me.
I Â«i M - c i? Ia ?. c ' s bonds have been fixed at
I HO,OOO. I lUess additional charges are re
corded against him he expects to be able
tm fin 1 the , neoe ,f, s ary bonds to-day. Sheriff
Phillips, in telling how he arrested Mc-
Glade, said that he had received a dis
patch from the police of this city, giving
a good description of MrOiade and ask
ing that he be arrested if seen. Phillips,
immediately after the receipt of the dis
patch, went to the railroad depot. Intend
ing to search the incoming trains for the
fugitive Just as he reached the depot the
train, which had arrived a few minutes
before, was about to pull out.
The Sheriff jumped on the platform of
one of the rear cars, intending to ask the
conductor if McGlade was aboard the
train. Just then he saw a man answer
ing the description of McGlade emeree
from behind the railroad building anJ
quickly enter one of the cars. Convinced
that he was the absconding cashier the
Sheriff accosted him and asked him If , c
was not W. P. Russell, the name under
which he was traveling.
"1 guess it is all up," he nervously re
marked. "That Is the name that I have
assumed."
"I'm the Sheriff of the county." replied
Phillips, showing his badge of office; "you
are badly wanted in San Francisco."
"Then I'm your prisoner, " remarked Mc-
Olade, grasping the extended hand of the
Sheriff.
McGlade was then escorted from the
train and taken to prison. He announced
his intention of coming back without
making any light. Phillips speaks of Mc-
Glade In the highest terms.
"He Is a perfect gentlfman." he de
clared; "I'm sorny that he is mixed up in
such an affair."
At Port Costa Phillips and the prisoner
were met by Detectives Cody and Gib
son. He cordially greeted them, but re
frained from discussing the case. It is
likely that several more charges of forg
ery will be preferred against him to-day

ner â Toribio Beaten by Novia.
A Day of Surprises
All Around.
The desperate three-head finish between
Obsidian, Limewater and Los Medanos in
the six and a half furlong run for two
year-olds was easily the feature of the
racing at Oakland yesterday. The victory
of Obsidian can be ascribed to Charley
Thorpe, whose superb exhibition of saddle
work gained for him an ovation from the
grand stand. The betting was all in favor
of Piggott's mount, Limewater, which
ruled a 6 to 5 favorite. At one time 5 to 2
was chalked against Los Medanos, but it
was early rubbed to 9 to 5. Plenty of Vh
to 1 was obtainable about the ultimate
winner. The first part of the running was
simply a two-horse affair between Log
Medanos and Limewater, both colts mov
ing along well under restraint. Less than
a furlong from the wire Thorpe made his
move with Obsidian, and soon had both
Piggott and Spencer hard at work. In an
eye-opening and hair-raising drive Obsid
ian got the verdict by a head, with Lime
water second, the same distance in front
of the Baldwin entry. It was one of the
season's prettiest bits of racing, both
from a spectacular as well as a time
standpoint, the winner covering the dis
tance in I:2OVi.
Surprises w^re numerous during the
afternoon, May W and Topmast proving
the only successful choices. Both in
their way are wonders.
In her present form May W looks un
beatable. The Calgary "phenom" picked
up 109 pounds and tripped off seven fur
longs in l:26Vi with such consummate
ease as to convey the impression that
she can fracture the coast record almost
any time. She closed a 1 to 2 favorite in
the betting and won hands down from
Rosinante and San Venado.
The particularly strong forte of Top
mast is stretch running, and his equal
has rarely been seen in these parts. The
Eastern horse, with Spencer on his back,
was an even money favorite for the mile
and a sixteenth selling event. At the
head of the stretch he was last, apparent
ly hopelessly out of it. There Spencer
shook him up, and, gradually wading
through his field, the Topgallant horse
beat the long shot Dr. Bernays a head.
Myth, a 40 to 1 chance, was a close up
third.
Billy Randall's Montana-bred geWinp,
Silver Beaux, took the opening scramble
for two-year-olds like breaking sticks.
Going to the post second choice, he was
away first, and the field was never able
to get to him. Peter Weber gut the
place handily from the favorite, Miss
Reel.
Toribio wns plunged on to win the sell
ing event at six furlongs, being backed
down to 4 to 5. He was outfooted all the
way by Novia, against which 3 to
1 was laid. Ruskin ran an improved race,
finishing third.
The good money was all bet on Pat
MorriFsey to win the final selling sprint
over the Futurity course. Frank McMa
hon's handy sprinter was slow to get away
from the post, and, despite Freeman's
hard riding, finished third behind Sport
McAllister and Good Hope. The winner,

Sport McAllister, was handled to perfec
tion by Spencer, and was as good as 7 to 1
In the ring.
Track Notes.
Bob Smith, the well-known veteran of
the saddle, arrived from Montana yester
day. He brought no horses with him.
Frank Ireland and Willie Applegate are
here again. Applegate is an extensive
speculator and booked at both Ingleside
and Oakland last season.
Spencer piloted two winners yesterday.
His handling of Sport McAllister was a
catchy piece of riding.
When Burns & Waterhouse paid i 2500 for
Obsidian it looked as if they had pur
chased a gold brick for some time. The
son of Stromboli is now picking up, and
gives promise of becoming a crack three
year-old.
A morning contemporary makes a great
deal of bluster over what it terms a "turf
scandal" In connection with the suspen
sion of Jockey Ben Gouin. Where the
big turf expose comes In is not quite plain.
On November 28 May W started in a race
tor the first time here this season, and ran
unplaced. Her odds were 6 to 1, and the
stable claimed to have backed her. On
December 2 she started again and won all
the way. On this occasion the Calgary
wonder was again played. The first time
out Gouin had the mount. In her winning
race she was ridden by Bullman. After
her win on December 2 Gouin was sus
pended, owing to the mare's greatly Im
proved showing, and Owner Camertm ac
cused the rider of pulling the mare the
first time out, at the same time naming
Phil Achibald as the bookmaker who lat<i
against her. Gouin claims he did not pull
the mare. Yesterday Phil Archibald ten
dered his sheets on both races to the
Judges for Inspection, and they showed
nothing out of the usual. Gouin may or
may not have pulled the mare, but he is
certainly entitled to as much considera
tion as any other rider as long as the
proof is lacking. If he is ruled off, then
half a dozen other owners and riders
should go with him. Trie form book cites
numerous instances of where horses made
no showing whatever the first time but,
but won hands down the next time start
ed. Gouin makes a living on the turf, and
until the "big expose" is published show
ing him guilty his side of the story should
be given as much credence as the own
er's.
George Rose Is reported away on a
hunting trip, and his book was missed
from the line yesterday.
Riley Grannan did not cut In, either,
preferring to have a try at the game from
the ground.
Sixteen pencilers handled the money.

NAPA STOCK FARM YEARLINGS.
The Big Sale of the Season at Killip
& Co.'s To-Night.
A portion of the big consignment of
thoroughbred youngsters fr-m the Kapa
Stock Farm of A. B. Spreckels will be led
into KlHip & Co.'s sales rins: to-night, the
remainder on Wednesday night. At the
first annual sale of this young" breeding
establishment one year ago the stake win
ners Canace and Sevens were two of the
crop. Canace was a sensational but an
unlucky performer, finishing second on no
less than sixteen occasions, beaten out in
desperate drives by the crack two-year
olds of the middle West. She also scored
many wins. Sevens was even faster, but
met with an accident after being taken
East. ,
The yearlings to be offered at sale to
night are the get of the richly bred stal
lions Imp. Crighton. Imp. Idalium. Eolo,
General Allies, Lew Weir (sire of Satyr).
Puryear D. and the superb English horse
The Judge. The matrons of this farm
were all chosen with the idea of produc
ing horses capable of winning, and the
band of sturdy looking youngsters to oe
lr-d into the ring to-night will be testi
mony of that fact.
LAID AWAY IN THE
OAKLAND CEMETERY
LAST RITES OVER THE BODY OF
JUDGE BORDEN.
The Superior Courts Closed in Re
spect to the Memory of the
Deceased Jurist.
The remains of the late Judge Rhodes
Borden were borne frnm the family resi
dence, at 424 Scott Street, yc-storclay after
noon and tak^n to their final resting place
in Mountain View Cemetery. Oakland.
The house" was crowded with friends of
the deceased when Rev. K. J. TJon of St.
Stenhen's Church stepped to the head of
tha casket and read the impressively
beautiful Episcopal service for the burial
of the dead. After this was concluded the
body was taken to the ferry arid trans
ferred to Oakland on the 2 o'clock boat.
Only the relatives and near friends at
tended the interment.
The floral tributes were many and beau
tiful. Thrown over and almost conceal
ing the casket was an exquisite floral pall
composed of violets, white roses, smilax
and fern leavesâ the sifent testimonial of
the employes of the City and County At
torney's office.
The honorary pallbearers were Harry
T. Creswell, J. B. Garber, Judge J. M.
Seawell, Patrick Noble, J. K. Moffltt,
William Grant. Crittenden Thornton and
Frank C. Drew.
Yesterday morning John M. Burnett, on
behalf of the Bar Association, visited the
various departments of the Superior
Court and to each Judge voiced the re
grets of that organization over the death
of the late Judge Borden. Mr. Burnett's
remarks were eulogistic of the deceased,
and at their conclusion the courts were
ordered adjourned out of respect to the
memory of the dead.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Dp'c. s.â There was much in
terest and curiosity manifested in Wall street
regarding the President's mes-a.:**.
When it was published it was found to be so
â  matter calculated to affect the value
;rities that the course of pr.ces was left
influence of technical causes. The re
cent â  BSlonal traders has been that
the message would prove to be a bull document
â¢ y have bought stocks recently upon that
tion. Upon the publication of the mes
sage it was natural, therefore, that this ele
meat -would have to sell :o take their profits.
But the chief effect of the anticipation of the
â <? was to curtail operations in the stock
market. This tendency was emphasized by
the absence of telegraphic communication with
DOinta in the country, owing to the
There was not entirely lacking also
the proverbial disposition of Stock Exchange
traders to the feeling of timidity over the ad
1 a session of Congress. There is some
thing of a prejudice In Wall street against
some of the measures which Representatives
rnbled at Washington design
for the public welfare, and â  . be ]<-t
alone in methods for the profitable employ
ment ol capital against which Congressional
- at times directed. The prevail
ing tone of the market, therefore, became ma
s the day wore on. There
wa -- â¢â¢ : '-omparative strength in the
morning, especially In some of the stocks
which snowed strength last ween. Metropoli
tan Street Railway mounted strongly 4^ points
and then reacted 3U on realizing, upon the mi
i quarterly dividend to an annual 7 per
cent rate from a ."â  per cent rate. Pacific Mail
and the iron and steel stocks continued mov
ing upward, but reacted sharply before the
close, particularly Federal Steel. Sugar fluc
tuated quite irregularly on the varying rumors
itua of the competition of the
trade. There was rather a notable advance in
a group of go)d stocks and some of the low
priced railway shares were also strong. United
Btatea Express rose to ",\ at one time, but re
acted to 56, and American Express uropped 5
points. The majority of the standard stocks
wore, however, notably dull end for the most
pan heavy. This was especially true of the
Grangers and the Pacifies. There was some
firmness manifested in coalers on the strength
of the cold weather.
The bond market was decidedly more active
than Btocka an.', prices were better maintained
though there was a reaction from best prices
in the later dealings. A number of lately dor
mant issues were brought into activity and
moved sharply upward. Total sales, $5.305 000

LONDON MARKET.
NEW TORK. Dec. s.â The Evening Post's
financial cablegram says: The stock markets
here were quiet and dull to-day, business being
checked by Saturday's gold withdrawal. There
wu an Improvement at the close, however,
whin it was announced that there had been
no :i: ther gold efflux to-day. Americans were
quiet. The arbitrage business was interfered
with by th* interruption of cable service at
New York. The close in this market was at
about the best. Brazil stocks were flat on a
sharp I -ill in exchange, which is partly due
to the large amount of Brazilian treasury bills
held here to mature next month. I learn that
next Saturday's withdrawal of Â£25,000 in gold
from the Bank of England was a special op- |
eration, the fact being that Spain had to
send a large amount of French or Spanish
gold coin to Havana. The Bank of France re
fused to part with the gnld. Spanish agents
had to take bar gold from the Bank of Eng
land and give to the Bank of France in ex
change for coin. I am also told, but I cannot
confirm the report, that Spain gave as security*
for the gold a lien on the $20,000,000 expected
from the I'nited States.
Gold continues in strong demand for Ger
many at 7Ss per ounce. The best-informed
operators say that Â£2,000,000 In gold is still to
go to Germany.
It appears that in a recent shipment an un
profitable exchange rate had been forced by
the terms of a contract requiring that the
proceeds of a Russian loan issued in Ger
many some time back should be paid in gold
on a certain date.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. s.â Wheat -was tower fiom
the start. May, opened at 66@6CVSc, a decline
of %@Uc from Saturday's closing . price, and
in the first few minutes of trading droppe 1
to 65% c. Telegraph communication with the
East was seriously Interrupted en account of
the recent storm, but enough was filtered
through to show the general j drift of specu
lative tendency abroad and at the seaboard.
It was decidedly bearish and this market was
affected accordingly. The \\?k of wire facili
ties also seriously interfered with buhiness, al
most no orders either to buy or sell coming
from the outside, and the market in conse
quence was extremely dull.
This in itself had a depressing effect on
prices, but it also kept them within a nar
row range. Liverpool was-%(g%a lower and re
ported an increase In stocks for the week of
about 75,000 bushels. Beerbohm estimated the
world shipment of wheat and flour at about
10,000,000 bushels, and 2,300,000 bushels of which
came from other countries than â  the United
States and Canada. The quantity afloat for
and in Europe was estimated to have increased
3,500,000 bushels. Northwest receipts were
heavy, notwithstanding the unfavorable weath
er, Minneapolis and Duluth reporting 1647 cars
compared with 15S8 last week and 1315 a year
ago. - ulcago receipts were 117 cars, none of
contract gra^e. A slight reaction followed
the decline to 65% c. due to a. little buying
against puts by the local crowd, but this was
soon satisfied. The May option sold up to
6Cc, however, and remained close to that price
the remainder of the session. It once touched
6o=(i@6s%c, but got back again to 66c, which
price ruled until near the close.
The market was apparently in the hands of
the local talent and their operations were so
limited that the pit at the time presented al
most a deserted appearance. May closed 65%@
66c.
Corn was a little more active than wheat
â¢but trading was limited. The market early
1 was easy on lower cables. Business was al
; most entirely local. May ranged from 34 %c to
34% c, and closed unchanged at 34Vi@34%c.
Oats were weak and lower. May ranged from
: 26 to 26% c, and closed a quarter cent lower
at WK&
Provisions were moderately active and strong
; Hog receipts were much less than expected
, May pork closed 17V4c higher at $9 57%; May

BAD CASE OF ABSENT-MIXDEDNESS.
There is a certain lawyer with an office
high up in the Society for Savings build
ing who is developing a strong absent
minded tendency.
A day or two ago he was writing a let
ter and jumped up suddenly to run to the
little stand on which reposed the big dic
tionary.
Ah he raised the cover of the volume he
stopped short like a man bewildered.
"What's the matter, old fellow?" called
out one of his partners.
"I declare." said the absent-minded
man, "I've clean forgotten the word I
meant to look for."
"Well, say," called the partner, "why
don't you commence at the beginning and
look until you find it?"
"By George." said the victim, "I never
thought of that!"
And opening up the dictionary at ' the
first page he began his lengthy task.
A moment later he suddenly slammed
the book shut and uttpred something that
sounded like a very naughty word stalked
back to his desk.â Cleveland Plaindealer.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 5.â early de
bate on war questions Is expected in the
House in connection with the deficiency
appropriation bill, which is devoted ex
clusively to items for the army and navy.
The bill was practically completed to-day,
and will be finally passed on in committee
to-morrow and then presented to the
House. Chairman Cannon of the "Appro
priation Committee said to-day that he
hoped to bfÃin consideration of the bill
oa "Wednesday and to pass It before '.he
end of the week. He hardly thought there
would be any general opening up of war
questions just now, although if the debate
ran into such channels he thought it
might as well come now as any time.

Walker has called a meeting of the House
Committee on Hanking and Currency for
Wednesday, which Is expected to ascer

a subject.

Dingley has called a meeting of the Ways

JOE WHEELER THE
CENTER OF ATTRACTION
WASHINGTON. Dec. 6.â Major General
Wheeler was thÂ« center of attraction
when he appeared in the House to-day
to resume his Congressional duties.
He arrived last night from the camp in
Alabama where his troops are stationed.
General Wheeler said he probably would
resign from the army, but his plans were
not yet definitely fixed.
'â¢If there is to be any more fighting: I
want to stay in the army," said the gen
eral, "but if the fighting is over I want
to return to civil life."
WHEELMAN DISPLAYS
MARVELOUS ENDURANCE
Bides Over Three Hundred and Four-
teen Miles Without Dis
mounting.
NEW YORK, Dec. s.â Frank Waller of
Boston has broken the only record up to
the present time in the six days' bicycle
race at Madison-square Garden. He now
holds the world's record for continuous
riding. He left his wheel at 4:10 o'clock
this afternoon, having ridden 314 miles
and 8 laps in sixteen hours and ten min
utes without dismounting, beating last
year's record of 272 miles made by Steph-
ane.
Waller took a short rest, losing two
places in the contest, Pierce, followed by
Miller, passing him. At the end of the
seventeenth hour Pierce was about five
mileÃ behind Waller's record of last year.
The record made by hours to-day fell short
three or four miles of those made last
year. Falls were more frequent this year
than last. Eight spills occurred to-day,
but none of the riders were seriously
hurt.
Miller aroused the greatest enthusiasm
this afternoon by Betting a wonderful
pace for many laps. Fredericks, Is awn
and Pierce were entirely outclassed for a
while, and only the veteran Waller was
able to stick to the champion and main
tain his relative position. Again and
asrain, amidst wild cries of delight from
thousands of throats, Miller spurted and
tried to shake off the tenacious Waller,
but the big German knew well that with
two miles to the good to keep up with
Miller was his end of the game, and he
held his own. âi_ ..

INSURES PROTECTION
TO FOREIGN RESIDENTS
Imperial Decree Issued by the
Empress Dowager of
China.
WASHINGTON. Dec. s.â The Secretary
of State has received a copy of a decree
recently issued by the Empress of China
having for its object the better protection
of foreign residents in that country. The
decree says in part:
From the opening of ports to foreign trade
to the present time foreigners and Chinese have
been as of one family with undivided Interests,
and since missionaries from foreign countries
are living In the Interior we have decreed,
not three or four times, hut many times, that
the local officers must protect them and that
the gentry and people of all provinces must
sympathize with our desire for mutual torn
lence; that they muÃt treat them truthfully
and honestly, without dislike or suspicion, with
the hope of lasting peaceful relations.
SPAIN DEPRIVED OF
TRADE PRIVILEGES
NEW YORK, Dec. 5.â A "Washington
special to the Herald says: It developed
to-day that the Cabinet meeting held
late Saturday night was for the pur
pose of discussing: propositions made by
Spain for trad privileges in the Philip
pines and her former West Indian pos
sessions. It was determined not to
grant the concessions asKea.
ANDREWS HAS NOT RESIGNED.
Retains His Position as Superinten
dent of Chicago Schools.
CHICAGO, Dec. s.â During the greater
part of the day the report was current
that Superintendent Andrews of the pub
lic school system, who recently came here
from Brown University, had offered his
resignation, but to-night the story was
denied. For some time there has been
trouble between Superintendent Andrews
and the Board of Education over the mat
ter of appointments, each desiring lo
possess the power of making them. There
seems to be no doubt that a letter of
resignation was actually written oy thÂ«
Superintendent, but it was intercepted by
friends before reaching the board offi
cially and the matter amicably adjusted.
Both sides have at least signed the pro
tocol, giving the coveted power to Super
intendent Andrews, and It Is believed the
formal treaty of peace will be made bind
ing to-morrow.
ELECTION CONTEST FILED.
Assessor Anderson of Monterey
County Declares He Was
"Counted Out."
SALINAS, Dec. sâ Although defeated on
the official count by sixty-seven votes,
County Assessor W. A. Anderson this
afternoon filed a contest of the election of
J. B. Bennett. Anderson alleges that in
numerous precincts votes cast for him
were counted for Bennett and that if a
recount is made he will be elected by 5
plurality.
The fight for the Asseesorshlp was one
of the hottest ever known In Monterey
County. It was alleged in experts' reports
that during the years 1895 and 1896 An
derson was short $1800. He repaid this
sum, claiming the shortage was due to
clerical errors. Great interest is taken
in the contest.
EXTENDED TOUR TABOOED.
Faculty Committee Rules Against
Stanford Musical Clubs.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 5.-
The faculty committee on student affairs
to-day refused to give the musical or
ganizations permission to make a concert
tour to Denver during the holidays. The
committee declared Itself opposed to ex
tended trips, as some of the former tours
are reported to have excited criticism be
cause of the action of certain members of
the clubs. The executive committee of the
student body has already given the clubs
authority to make the trip and many of
the arrangements have been made. The
action of the faculty committee will quash
the project. It came as a surprise to the
clubs.

DID DR. JOHNSON EAT HORSEP
Dr. Johnson in his journal mentions the
Interesting fact that he had on a certain
day had "palfrey for dinner." Now these
three words have caused not a little
trouble to the critics, and for this rea
son, that they know not what palfrey
really is. It has been suggested that pal
frey is a clerical error made by the doc
tor himself for pastry. But the doctor
wrote so legibly, and there is so much
difference between the words palfrey and
pastry, that his position is not at all ten
able. Palfrey is defined in Johnson's cele
brated dictionary as "a small horse fit
for ladies," and some have thought that
the doctor (whose feats as a trencher
man were notorious) may have broken a
record on the day in question and dis
posed of a small horse. All these and
other conjectures are wrong, and we will
proceed to give the correct explanation.
The word palfrey (sometimes pamfrey
by the interchange of 1 and m) is still
in use among the rustics of Scotland and
the North of Ireland, and means young
cabbages when they first come to table
in the spring. Such cabbages have not
begun to "close," or become solid in the
center. They are generally spoken of as
"early pamfrey." and are considered a
luxury. Dr. Johnson probably picked up
the word from his friend Boswell. or from
some other Scotch acquaintance.â Notes
and Queries.
WANT THE RUINS REMOVED.
Merchants in the Vicinity of the
Baldwin Ask Chief Sullivan

in an appeal to Chief Sullivan of the t ire
Department. The petitioners state that
E. J. Baldwin refuses to permit the dan

WESLEY'S LETTERS.
Epistles Written by the Apostle of
Methodism to His Wife.
All the world knows that John Wes
ley's marriage was more or less a fail
ure, and some very interesting: letters
bearing on the subject will be sold at
Messrs. Sotheby's next month. They
extend from the year 1751 to 1778. The
earliest is dated from Tetsworth, March
27, 1751, and that is written in a very
affectionate style: "Oh, how can we
praise God enough for making us
helpsmeet for each other. lam utter
ly astonished at His goodness." Seven
years later he was writing in a very
different strain. The letter from which
we extract a few lines is dated Nor
wich, December 23, 1758:
"I was much concerned ye night be
fore L left London at your unkind and
unjust accusation. You accused me
of unkindness, cruelty and what not.
And why so? Because I Insist on
choosing my own company! Because
I insist by conversing, by speaking or j
writing, with those whom I (not you)
judge proper. For more than seven
years this has been a bone of conten
tion between you and me, and it is so
still. For I will not. I cannot, give
it up. But then you will rage and fret,
and call me names."
Nineteen years later (September 1,
1777) the reverend gentleman again re
turned to the attack: "Some years
since, without my consent and knowl
edge, you left me and settled at New
castle. I received you again without
any terms, nay, without any acknowl
edgment you had gone wrong. Two
years ago you left me again, without
my consent or knowledge. A few days
since I met you, and (to my great sur
prise) you seemed willing to return.
But, it may be asked, what reparation
are you either able or willing to make?"
Writing eleven months later from
Bristol (October 2, 1778) he observes:
"As it is doubtful, considering your age
and mine, whether we may meet any
more in this world, I think it right to
tell you my mind once for all without
either anger or bitterness." After al
luding to the fact that his wife left him
without his consent or knowledge, he
goes on to observe:
"Ever since (and, indeed, long before)
you have made my faults the constant
matter of your conversation. Now, sup
pose a husband has many faults, is it
the part of a prudent wife to nublish
(my real or supposed) faults, not to one
or two intimates only (though, perhaps,
that would have been too much), but
to all Bristol, to all London, to all Eng
land, to all Ireland. Yea, you did
whatever in you lay to publish it to all
the world, thereby designing 'to put a
sword into my enemies' hand 3.' "
The apostle of Methodism concludes
thus: "If you were to. live a thousand
years you could not undo the mischief
that you have done. And till you have
done all you can toward it I bid you
farewell."â London Telegraph.
HAS KILLED 6000 DOGS.
The local dog killer was telling his
story the other day. The man who was
assigned to slaughter all the stray dogs
that drifted to the pound was a member
of the police force, and he says his record
has passed the six thousand mark. To
kill 6000 dogs In the course of an ordinary
run of work Is not a record to be made
easily, and the killer thinks that he has
the largest list to his credit in the coun
try.
"I have always killed the dogs with a
parlor rifle," said the official executioner
fur canine prisoners, "and owing to the
fact that I am considered a good shot I
have had the bad luck to get the detail
a great many more times than I would
have ..Ked. Many a time have I gone to
the pound and found forty or fifty dogs
waiting there to be shot, and the minute
I would enter they would seem to know
my mission and try to avoid me. I always
used a small rifle, and it was therefore
necessary to hit the dogs square in the
brain in order to kill them quickly and
with as little pain as possible. I would
have to whistle to the prisoners to look
at me so I could get a fair aim. Well,
they would understand what I wanted so
well that they would turn and hang their
heads against the wall. Many a time have
I left the pen sick at heart with myself
and my Job.
"The most disagreeable experience I
ever had was with a little black and tan
terrier. There were forty-five dogs in the
pen one morning when I went in. and half
an hour later not one was on his feet.
It was customary for us to go about and
kick the dogs after they had been shot
to see if they were dead, and I was doing
this when the little terrier Jumped up and
made a break for liberty. He had been
'possuming,' and he was the deadest look
ing dog I ever saw until I kicked him.
When thp terrier got to the gate and
found it locked he made a dash around
the clrrlp. whining pitifully, and my heart
failed me.
"The fact is I would have lost my Job
before I would have shot that little dog,
and as he came around again I called to
the gatekeeper and we let him out. He
flew down the street when he was free
from the pound. That happened while
Captain Golden was Chief, and I knew
he was strict about such matters, so I
ff>lt uneasy about letting the dog go.
When J told him of it, however, he said
he would have discharged me had I killed
the terrier."
All the stray dogs found In the streets
here are sent to the pound, and if the
owners do not pay a fine and claim the
property the police executioner is called
out.â New York Sun.
THE SIKHS.
Sir Lepel Griffin has placed on record
his conviction that the Sikhs form the
backbone of the Indian army, for the fol
lowing reasons: Ghurkas. though at
least equally valuable as infantry, are by
no meas bo plentiful, and are an independ
ent race. Pathans are apt to become
homesick and dislike to be stationed at
any great distance from their native land.
Difficulty is experienced in enlisting pure
Rajputs in any number. But the Sikh
! Is always ready to enlist and to undertake
duty across the "Black Water," even
should that duty be to fight an epidemic
in Hongkong or to chase Arab slave deal
era in Central Africa, if only he be well
paid. He Is equally good as horse or
foot, at defense or in attack. He appre
ciates the value of discipline and is de
voted to his duty.â Gentleman's Maga

WAR ON THE
OCCIDENTAL
AND ORIENTAL
Chinese Dislike the
New Line.
ILL TREATMENT CLAIMED
THE PATRONS OVERCHARGED,
ABUSED AND ROBBED.
Circulars Warning Prospective Pas
sengers Against the Company
ITeely Distributed in
Chinatown.
The Chinese do not like the Occidental
and Oriental Steamship Company, and are
making an effort to have all members of
their race boycott the new line.
Circulars in the Chinese language, head
ed "Warning to the Public" and signed by
"Those who have Buffered," have been
scattered broadcast over Chinatown dur
ing the pfist week, and the charges
against the steamship company made in
the circular have caused considerable
comment among the Celestials. The peo
ple are advised not to patronize the "new
company," as the O. and O. is termed, on
account of the ill treatment given the
Chinese passengers. This circular is sim
ply an open expression of the opinion
held of the company ever since it started.
"For some time past," a prominent mer
chant In Chinatown said last night,
"there has been considerable complaint
from the people arriving here from Hong
kong, and the stories of abuse and over
charge which they have told has caused a
great deal of talk, and now a large pro
portion of the Chinese going back to
Hongkong are taking the coast steamers
up to Victoria and there embarking tor
China on vessels of some of the routes
leading from there."
The chief complaint set forth in the cir
cular is that the passengers are abused by
the crew. The authors of the dodgers fur
ther claim that the company refuses to al
low Its passengers to carry all of their be
longings as baggage, charging freight for
all but one bundle and a blanket, and they
say at the end of the voyage the owner
is a lucky man if he is able to find his
belongings. One Instance of many is
sighted in the case of a Chinaman who
left here on the Belgic last month. A
trunk in which was packed considerable
wearing apparel of value and several hun
dred dollars in gold was taken from him
and sent below as freight. When Hong
kong was reached the trunk and Its con
tents were missing.
Anottier comDlatnt is that passengers
from Hongkong to this city are required
to put up a deposit with the company for
return fare. This is done by the company
to protect itself in case the immigration
Inspectors refuse to admit the passenger
in question. If the passenger is allowed
to land the money Is returned, but the
Chinese do not like the method.
The circular further objects to the quar
ters at the Mall dock which the Chinese
are huddled Into after being allowed to
disembark. The accommodations, It is
claimed, are not fit for a cow. Besides
for the three days before leaving the
vessel 25 cents a day extra is charged for
board, and then after the pasengers are
landed on the dock they are charged 60
cents a day until the inspectors allow
them to go. The food at the dock, the cir
cular claims, is miserable, and at most
should not cost more than 10 cents a day.
The circular concludes with an urgent
warning to all the cousins and friends of
the authors not to take the "new com
pany" under any consideration should
they desire to return to China. The well
known clannishness of the Chinamen will,
no doubt, result In this warning being
heeded.

SAMUELP.FLINT
KILLED BY AN
OAKLAND TRAIN
His Skull Badly Frac
tured.
WAS ON HIS WAY HOME
THROWN FIFTEEN FEET BY THE
LOCOMOTIVE.
He Was a align Official in the Rail
way Mail Service and Was
Well and Widely
Known.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Dec. 5.
Samuel P. Flint, assistant superintend
ent of the railway mail service, was struck
by a broadgauge locomotive at Fourteenth
and Franklin streets to-night. He died
from his injuries a few hours later.
Mr. Flint had been away to Los Angeles
SAMUEL FLINT, the Well-Known
Railway Mail Service Officer Who
Was Fatally Injured by an
Oakland Train.
the past few days on business connect- i
ed with his office and was just returning
to his home, 772 Telegraph avenue, coming
by way of the new broadgauge local,
which was due at Fourteenth street sta
tion at 6:30 o'clock. The train was late
in reaching its destination, and the mat
ter of switching the engine at Fourteenth
street, preparatory to pulling out for the
narrow-gauge mole again, was hurried
with unusual alacrity. According to G. L.
King, residing at Linda Vista, who was
perhaps the only eye witness, Mr. Flint
alighted from the north side of the train
after locomotive 1646 had been already un
coupled. The engine was speeding along
the sidetrack to the head just as Mr.
Flint stepped in its path. He was thrown
about fifteen feet to one side of the track,
where )u was picked up unconscious and
bleeding profusely from an ugly gash on
his head.
At the Receiving Hospital Drs. Strat
um. Kane and Horn, assisted by Steward
Tobin and Dr. Keating, attended to Mr.
Flint's injuries, the most serious of which
consisted of a badly fractured skull, mak
ing the operation of trephining essential.
With this the surgeons proceeded almost
immediately. Whether Mr. Flint also
sustained internal injuries wan not known.
He was quite corpulent, and his age (60
years* made his case all the more serious.
But faint hopes of his recovery were held
by his physicians, and their fears were
nallzed about 10 o'clock, when he breath
ed his last.
Mr. Flint was in the railway mail
service the past twelve or fifteen years.
He was division superintendent until last
July, when he was made assistant super
intendent. He had resided in this city for
many years and was prominent in G. A. R.
circles. He was a native of Pennsylvania.
His aged wife was stricken with grief
when she learned of the sad affair. She
hastened to the hospital, but owing to
her husband's condition she was not per
mitted to see him. They had no children.
HAD A SIMPLE FUNERAL.
Luther P. Fisher's Requests, How-
ever, Were Deemed Too Radical.
OAKLAND. Dec. s.â The funeral of the
latp Lather P. Fisher took place this
morning from the First Cot^rregatlonal
Church, and the remain weffznterred in
Mountain View < 'i motery.
â¢ 'ontrary to the last request of the de
cf-a^-d, the remains were encased in a
jieat black cloth-covered casket with
oxidized handles, but the lid bore no sil
ver plato. There was an absence of fu
neral flowers, their place being taken by
a cluster of chrysanthemums and violets.
ThÂ»- pall-bearers were Judge Robert
Thompson. David Howes, Henry P. Carle
ton and Henry W. Knoll, all of whom
were classmates of deceased many years
ago at Andover, Mass.
Rev. Dr. Mooar and Rev. J. K. McLean
delivered short eulogies and Rev. Dr.
Brown eloped with a prayer. During the
services a quartet, comprising Mr. and
Mrs. George H. Collins, Mrs. Hathaway
and George Burbeck, sang "My Faith
Looks Ip to Thee" and "Some Sweet
Day, By and By."
Tobin Will Be Deputy.
OAKLAND, Dec. s.â The many rumors
concerning the Coroner's deputy and the
proposed location of the morgue under
Corom-r-elect 11. B. Mchrmann are rap
idly crystallizing into facts. The Deputy
Coronership is now a settled matter as
I. D. Tobin was to-day officially informed
of his appointment. The new appointee
has for the past several years filled the
stewardship at tne Receiving Hospital in
Indent manner, and will be by no
means a novice in his new vocation, he
having been formerly In the undertaking
business. As to the location of the
morgue, it was currently reported to-day
that George < lark and Mr. Booth Sacra
mento undertakers, had purchased an In
terest in the local business of J L *>ie-
Cftithy and that Coroner-elect Mehrmann
would beyond question establish his head
quarters at their place of business on San
Pablo avenue, opposite the City Hall

OAKLAND. Dec. s.â Miss Abble Clift
daughter of William Clift and sister of
Justice Fred C. Clift, was married this
evening to Irving Lundborg, teller of the
San Francisco .National Bank. The cere
mony was performed at the home of the
bride's parents.
Teams going south over the Alice-street
bridge, which will be used during the
construction of the new Webster-street

Board of Supervisors having passed an
order to that effect to-day. The necessary
repairs on the Alice-street bridge and the
approaches are rapidly nearlng comple

JUSTICE HARD'S
DAMAGE SUIT
GETS A JOLT
His Character Could
Not Be Injured.
SO JUDGE HALL DECIDED
CONSTABLE GRAY'S DEMURRER
HAS BEEN SUSTAINED.
First Point in the Suit Brought Over
the Locking Up of an
Alameda Temple of
Justice.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Dec. 5.
Constable George D. Gray of Alameda
has won the first point in the $5000 damage
suit brought against him and his bonds
men by Justice of the Peace D. T. Hard
of the same city.
Hard sued Gray and his bondsmen, R.
B. Tappan. Nicholas Reinecker, Oscar
Meysel and C. W. Tappan. for the amount
mentioned on account of the closing up
of his courtroom with the Constable's
look, the furniture and paraphernalia in
the temple of Justice being required to
satisfy a claim for $20 for which an at
tachment had issued. By reason of Gray's
act Justice Hard set up that he had been
disgraced and his character injured.
Gray and his bondsmen demurred and
this pleading was heard .before Superior
Judge Hall to-day. The demurrer was
based upon the grounds of misjoinder
of parties, misjoinder of causes, ambig
uity, and a fine technicality between char
acter and reputation.
Judge Hall sustained the demurrer and
in doing so stated that Justice Hard's
character could not have been disgraced
by reason of Constable Gray's act or any
acts of any one else.
REDDY HELD TO ANSWER.
Must Suffer for the Commission of a
Brutish Crime.
ALAMEDA, Dec. s.â John P. Reddy was
held to answer before the Superior Court
this afternoon by Justice Henry Morris on
a charge of attempted criminal assault.
His victim was little Irene Shattuck, the
11-year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C
W. Shattuck, residing at Enclnal avenue
and Chestnut street. The public was ex
cluded from the courtroom during tne
progress of the examination. J. W. Stet
son represented the State and J. J. Mc-
Donnell conducted the case for the de
fense. The testimony was of a most re
volting nature. City Marshal Rogers
stated that when he arrested Reddy at
San Jose, at the time he was suspected
of having shot Officer Keyes. he ac
knowledged the charge of assault, but
protested that he was Innocent of the
shooting. The nature of the cross-exam
ination by the defense was a virtual ad
mission of guilt. An attempt was made
to prove that Reddy committed his crime
at the invitation of his victim; in other
words, that he, a man of 40 years, had
been led astray by a little child just past
her eleventh summer.
Alameda City Trustees.
ALAMEDA, Dec. s.â City Marshal Oscar
Rogers presented his resignation to the
City Trustees to-night to take effect Jan
uary 1, 1899, at which date he will assume
the duties of Sheriff of Alameda County.
Officer Louis Sehoeman, who will be a
jailer under Rogers, will also withdraw
from the local police force. Sergeant
John Conrad will be appointed Marshal
for the unexpired term. Officer Schu
macher will be advanced to the position
of sergeant. This will leave two vacan
cies in the Alameda police force. Frank
H. Hackett and Edward Hadley will be
appointed to fill the vacancies.
Jacob Hoeck, who had his little sons
confined in the City Prison over night to
force them to make a confession that they
had purloined a bucket of paint, filed
charges against Officer Albert Kamp, al
leging that he had given information in
connection with the case to a Call re- j
porter. The Trustees referred the matter \
to a committee for investigation. Mr.
Kamp was In charge of the prison at the
time but he gave no information to the
reporter. He refused to allow the boys to
be interviewed without an order from his
superior officer.
Alameda Camera Club.
ALAMEDA, Dec. s.â The Alameda Cam
era Club will formally open its new head
quarters in Lafayette Hall to-morrow
night. Some of the most expert and en
thusiastic amateurs of this city are in
cluded in the club's membership. The new
rooms have been fitted up with consider
able taste and convenience. Dark rooms
have been built for the use of the mem
bers, and the walls of the assembly hall
are covered with their work. The club
was organized about a year ago. At the
beginning there was a hard, up-hill strug
gle to keep the organization in existence,
but now its affairs are in a flourishing con
dition. The first anniversary will be cele
brated by a stereoptlcon exhibition of
â¢views taken by the club members. A new
board of officers will be elected at to-mor
row evening's meeting.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1898.
SLOW PROGRESS
IN THE BRANDES
EXAMINATION
Important Witnesses
Want to Get Away.
MRS. M. GODFREY TESTIFIES
j WAS WITH MRS. BRANDES WHEN
LILLIAN WAS BEATEN.
Dilatory Tactics That Made Witness
McKeown Say That He Wished
Brandes, Too, Was
Dead.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Deo. 5.
The prosecution, at the preliminary
hearing of W. A. Brandes, charged with
the cruel murder of his 13-yearfOld daugh
ter, Lillian, put another very important
witness on the stand this afternoon. The
witness, who was listened to eagerly by
the big throng of spectators that has
crowded into Justice Cliffs courtroom
every day since the hearing began last
Thursday, was Mrs. M. Godfrey, another
neighbor of the Brandes at Berkeley.
On the fateful Tuesday night when Lil
lian was being beaten Mrs. Godfrey and
Mrs. Brandes sat in the parlor at the
home of the latter. According to the wit
ness' story as told to-day, Brandes went
downstairs, and soon after Mrs. Godfrey
heard the girl exclaim, "Oh, Al! Please
dont!" whereupon the cruel and infuriated
father cursed her, and with vile epithets
told her If she did not find "that money"
he would choke her. Witness stated that
she heard the beating, which was soon
followed by a noise sounding as though a
body was being dragged along the tloor
downstairs.
Earlier this afternoon Mrs. Nina Rich
ardson was recalled to the witness stand
and reiterated principally facts that have
already been published, and which were
adduced at the hearing on Saturday last.
In the instance of both these witnesses
the attorneys for the defense have tried
In every way to find pointed discrepancies,
but without avail, and thus far their tes
timony stands unchallenged for truth and
veracity as well as Importance to the
prosecution.
It was stated to-day that J. S. Harvey,
perhaps the most essential witness for the
people, is anxious to get away to Canada,
and he chafes greatly over the dilatory
tactics that have thus far marked the
proceedings. His cross-examination, It is
predicted, will occupy considerable time.
J. McKeown, another witness, has been
compelled to neglect certain business of his
own at San Rafael owing to the hearing,
and when speaking to Deputy District At
torney Allen to-day about getting away,
McKeown exclaimed. "I wish that
Brandes, too, was dead." From this re
mark the tenor of his testimony might
be judged.
The religious zeal of the accused is
manifesting itself more strongly every
day. Yesterday, when the Salvation Army
held its Sunday services at the County
Jail, Brandes knelt lon* and prayed fer
vently.

bers of the freshman and junior classes
of the dental department of the Univer
sity of California, are congratulating
themselves on their narrow escape from
being launched on the world without a
license to wield the forceps or to ease
tooth-aching humanity. The happy eight
owe their good iortune to the leniency of
Dr. L. L. Dunbar, uean of the well-known
institution, and since the Incident that
nearly resulted in their expulsion from the
college they worship him from afar.
These young men, who are studying to
extract teeth without pain, were guilty of
being ringleaders in a class rush, an un
pardonable thing in the eyes of
the faculty, even when Indulged in
outside the place of study, but
when practiced In the very lec
ture hall of the Institution the offense be
comes a heinous one. To make matters
worse, Dr. Dunbar was a witness to the
affair and promptly took measures to
quell the disturbance.
It occurred on Frida^ morning and wu
the direct outcome of a game of baseball .
indulged in by the two classes the day
before, and which resulted in a score of
7 to 5 in favor of the freshmen. The Jun
iors would have abideu by the result and
at a future day tried to win back their
prestige had not a "freshy" tried to make
the defeat one to remember and digest by
printing the score on a large piece of
cardboard and emphasizing it by adding
that "it wasn't so worse. This harm
less piece of cardboard suspenued high on
the blackboard seemed a veritable red
rag to the juniors when they espied It on
their entrance to t..e lecture hall just be
fore 9 o'clock on the eventful morning. A
leader sprang up in the gathering class
and he quickly brought a high step lad
der to aid him in removing the distasteful
sign. While he was in the act of doing
so the freshmen took umbrage at the pro
ceeding and rallied around the foot of the
ladder for the purpose 01 making him de
sist. The junior's classmates were not
slow In coming to his assistance, and a
merry rush resulted. The dean's entrance
was unnoticed in the excitement and eight
of me young me^ were caught redhanded.
When the noise subsided Dr. Dunbar
pointed out the error of their way in a
short but calm discourse and then the
work of the day was postponed until the
dean could meet other members of the
faculty and decide on what punishment
should be meted out*" the otienders. After
a prolonged discussion it was decided to
forgive them this time and again the en
joyable task of studying how to ease
aching molars was tr\ken up.
Overcome by Monoxide.
Peter Kearns, an employe of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company,
came near shuffling off the mortal coll
yesterday afternoon by inhaling a supera
bundance of monoxide from one of the
company's mains. Kearns was sent by
the company to connect the gas supply
from the main on Seventeenth street to
the St. Nicholas Laundry, which is lo
cated on that street between Folsom and
Harrison streets. While engaged in the
performance of his duty he inhaled more
of the poisonous vapor than was good
for his respiratory organs, ana as a con
sequence he fell unconscious in the trench
in which he had been at work. A citizen
happened to be passing at the time and
he ran to the Seventeenth street police
station and notified Officer James ><orton
that a man was lying dead in the street.
The patrol wagon was sent to the scene
and the unconscious man was sent to the
City and County Hospital.where Dr Roche
labored over him for two hours with the
result that he was restored to life. He
was sufficiently recovered to leave the
hospital last night for his home.
Home of the Fur Seals.
George A. Clark, secretary of the Fur
Seal Commission, delivered an interest
ing lecture to a large audience in the
Academy of Sciences building last night
on the "Fur Seals and Fur Seal Islands."
He opened his lecture by showing maps
of the islands of the Aleutian group most
frequented by the seal with the valuable
skin, and then further illustrated his lec
ture with pictures of various portions of
the islands. The lecture was a revela
tion to many of the audience, as it show
ed that these islands which people are
prone to consider as bare, frozen wastes
contain pretty villages and. at certain
seasons, fields luxuriant with wild flow
ers and flowering mosses. Mr. Clark is a
successful lecturer, who amuses as weil
as instructs his audience as he presents
the dryest scientific facts in the form of
pleasant anecdotes.

ALL IS READY FOR
THE BOTKIN TRIAL
A Number of Witnesses in the Case
From Delaware Arrive With
Detective McVey.
John P. Dunning Will Give the Prosecution All the
Assistance in Bis Power â Defense Expects an
Acquittal â Mrs. Botkin in Court,
After a futile effort to extradite Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, accused
of sending a box of poisoned bonbons to Dover, Del., which caused
the death of two women, the authorities of California and Delaware,
in order that justice may be done, have united to prosecute the de
fendant under the statutes of this State. This case, which is witnout
a parallel in criminal jurisprudence, has attracted world-wide at
tention, first because of the enormity of the crime and second be
cause of the possibility that a person may commit a dastardly mur
der and escape punishment because of a defect in our criminal laws.
The trial of the accused woman is about to begin, but if the jury
finds for conviction the jurisdiction of California will be denied,
and the question carried to the Supreme Court for determination.
The defense, relying upon the weakness of the prosecution, has not
seen fit to raise this point until all evidence against the defendant
has been submitted and passed upon by the jury. Beyond me legal
technicalities the public has a deeper and an anxious interest in
this celebrated case. A murderer sent an agency of death through
the mails from this city and it accomplished its fiendish errand, and
if it be proved that Mrs. Botkin posted the package and yet can es
capfe punishment, every person having a known or unknown enemy
need feel alarmed.
THE selection of a jury which Is to
decide whether or not Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin is a modem Borgia or an in
nocent woman will begin this morn-
Ing in Judge Carroll Cook's court. The
Delaware witnesses are here to testify
against the woman accused of poisoning
Mrs. J. P. Dunning and Mrs. J. D. Deane.
The case was set for yesterday, but court
adjourned until 10 a. m. to-day out of
respect for the late Judge Borden, whose
funeral was held in the afternoon. Mrs.
Botkin will be tried first for the murder
of Mrs. Dunning.
John P. Dunning, husband of the mur
dered woman, has arrived in the city and
ivill make a clean breast of his relations
with Mrs. Botkin. He believes she is j
guilty and will not spare her or attempt j
in avoid unpleasant notoriety for himself.
He declare? that everything that could be
eaid against him has been printed from
one end of the country to the other, and |
he is indifferent to any comment whicli i
can now be made. Dunning did not arrive j
with the other Eastern witnesses. He
came from Chicago by the Central route,
while the others came from Delaware by
the Southern route.
The Delaware witnesses reached the
city at 4:45 last evening, and are now
quartered at the Grand Hotel. They were

give at the trial. Last night Mr. Hosmer.
Chief Lees Attorney General White and
Detective McVey went over the case in a
general way, and when the taking of tes
timony begins they will be prepared to
present the strongest case possible.
When the party left Delaware ex-Con
gressman Pennington, who is well along in
years, was not in the best of health and
his relatives and friends feared the trip
ana its attendant worry would be too
great a strain upon his strength. Fortu
nately his indisposition was only tempo
rary and he reached the end of the Jour
ney in better health and SDirits than when
he started. Mr. Pennington did not care
to discuss the terrible fate of his daugh
ters or the purpose of his visit here. He
was deeply, interested, however, in learn
ing all he could about Mrs. Botkln, where
she was imprisoned, her appearance, and
the proceedings in court yesterday. The
few expressions he made on the case indi
cate that he believes the accused woman
is guilty and he hones to see her convict
ed. He is familiar with the penal statutes
of California and can see no reason why
a speedy trial should not be had and exact
justice meted to the defendant.
J. D. Deane, whose grief over the terri
ble death of his wife is undiminished, ex
pressed himself with extreme bitterness.
"We all feel bitterly over this case and
think the murderess of my wife and her
sister should have been Bent to Delaware
for trial.
"We all want to get through with the
case and return home as quickly as possi
ble. Drs. Bishop and Downs have lÂ«ft
their practice; Attorney General WhitÂ©
had to turn his official and private affairs
over to others and Dr. Wolf is forced to
neglect his duties while out here. We hope
the trial will not be delayed and that we
can start homeward â in ten days or two
weeks, at the farthest."
John P. Dunning, whose wife is believed
to have been the particular object of the
alleged murderess' hate, has come pre
pared to be roasted by Mrs. Botkin's at
torneys and by the newspapers.
He said last night: "I am here to give
testimony in court and not to the news
papers. I have been in the newspaper
business a great many years and often
criticized people whom I believed ought
to have talked for publication; but I
know how it is, and even here among my
friends, the men I worked with, I shall
not give the substance of my evidence
until I am on the witness stand. Then I
shall tell all and the lawyer and the news
papers can say what they please about me.
Everything evil that could be said has
been printed from here to New York, and
I am calloused to further attacks. I have
not gone to the devil and I am not going
there."
"When I left here last March I admit I
was in a bad way, but I went to New
York to get a fresh start. From there I
went to Havana, where I was the Asso
ciated Press correspondent prior to the
war. When hostilities were opened I
went to Santiago and was all througli the
campaign and â¢ took as many chances as
any correspondent. I underwent terrific
ordeals and was working to recover my
former standing and was successful. My
only desire was to return to New York,
have my family with me and again be
happy. This desire was all but fulfilled,
when my wife was murdered. When the
news reached me I was ln Porto Rico. I
returned home immediately. I went to
Delaware and told the authorities every
thing I knew which had any bearing on
the crime. Since August I have had sev
eral good offers to return to Cuba, but 1
refused in order that I might come here
when needed and not be accused of at
tempting to shield a criminal with whom
I had been formerly â¢ associated It is
true I wrote to Mrs. Botktn. but the
charge, by innuendo, that I in any way
conspired to murder my wif i is the gross
est Injustice that could be done any man.
I am subject to criticism, I know, but I
am not going to let that, deter me from
laying bare the worst chapter in my
whole life. I want the murderer of my
wife punished."
Mrs. Botkln appeared in Judge Cook's
court yesterday neatly attired in a close
fitting black' suit, with a new black hat
and heavy veil. . Ker manner did not in
any way indicate that she was nervous or
apprehensive as to the result of the trial
which may condemn her as a double mur
deress. She trusts in her attorneys' as
surance that she will be acquitted. . Im
mediately after court â  was called Judge
Cook announced that an adjournment
until this morning would be taken in re
spect to the late Judge Borden, whose
funeral service was to be held in the
afternoon. The â¢ attorneys made no ob

who. had been summoned as Jurors and a
large number of curious individuals, who
craned their necks to get a glimpse of
the now famous prisoner. When Mrs.
Botkin and "her faithful sister. Dora
Brown, passed through the corridors from
the Sheriff's office to the court room they
ran a gauntlet of Inquisitive eyes, but
neither was embarrassed or perturbed in
the least. The defendant took a seat lac
ing his Honor and beside her associate
counsel, Messrs. McGowan and Wheeler.
George Knight, chief counsel for the de
fense, was not in court, as he knew the
adjournment was to occur.
Mr. Botkin was not present at the pro
ceedings yesterday. All the witnesses
were excused until to-morrow.
Attorney Knight is confident that his
client will be acquitted. He declares no
delays will be asked and that the de
fense is anxious for a speedy trial. He
outlined Mrs. Botkin's defense ln a few
words yesterday, saying:
"The defense will combat the corpus de
licti. The prosecution cannot establish a
case and the defendant will be acquitted.
All the witnesses from Delaware and all
those here cannot prove that Mrs. Dun
ning and her sister died from arsenical
poisoning. The doctor may testify that
the ante-mortem symptoms were similar
to those where arsenic has been adminis
tered, but their opinion won't hang any
one. They can't prove the charge. As
for the handwriting, we won't pay much
attention to that. The testimony of ex
perts doesn't amount to much and espe
cially when it comes to convicting a
woman of murder. The whole case of the
prosecution is flimsy and the taxpayers
should never have been put to the $30,000
or $40,000 expense to try a case which must
fail. The defense will not obstruct progf
ress in securing a jury. We will be satis
fied with any twelve ordinarily intelligent
citizens."
Judge Cook and Attorneys Hosmer and
Knight think the trial will not last over
ten days.

Sudden Death of LIEUTENANT JAMES E. NOLAN, Fourth
Cavalry, Presidio, Yesterday Afternoon.
FIRST LIEUTENANT JAMES E. NOLAN, Troop I, Fourth United
States Cavalry, died at the Presidio at 5:30 o'clock yesterday after
noon of pneumonia, after an illness of four and a half days. In his
death the regular army loses a loyal, brave and trusted soldier. Lieu
tenant Nolan was one of the most popular officers in the army, and he had
a host of friends, to whom his death meant a personal loss, for he was a
generous, true and kind friend, an efficient and capable officer and an af
fectionate husband and father. He was a man who held his friends by the
nobleness of his character and the gentleness of his personality. In speak
ing of him last night, one of his brother officers said: "James Nolan was
a man you could always count on. He was, like Chevalier Bayard, a sol
dier sans peur et sans reproche."
About two months ago Lieutenant Nolan contracted a severe case of
bronchitis, and while he apparently recovered, he never entirely regained
his health. He was advised by his friends to go to Arizona, but refused
to leave his duties. Last Wednesday night he. with some of his brother
officers, attended the performance of "Secret Service." The next morning
he was so unwell that Dr. McGettigan was sent for. Realizing the serious
symptoms of pneumonia. Dr. McGettigan refused to allow Lieutenant
Nolan to get up. He continued to grow worse, and although he made a
brave fight for life, his tired spirit quietly slipped away yesterday after
noon shortly after retreat. In fact, hardly had the flag he loved so well
been lowered and furled for the night before the soul of the brave sol
dier was at rest. Drs. Kerr and McGettigan were with Lieutenant Nolan
when he died, as was also his wife.
Lieutenant Nolan was a native of Wisconsin, about 38 years of age.
He was appointed to the Military Academy in 1882, and graduated four
years later, being assigned to the Fourth Cavalry, with which regiment
he served continuously until the time of his death. In July, 1893, he was
made first lieutenant and transferred to the Tenth Cavalry, but never
joined it, and was transferred back to the Fourth. He came here about
eight years ago with his regiment. His first service was in Arizona. When
the war broke out Lieutenant Nolan organized M Troop, now commanded
by Lieutenant Lockwood. Lieutenant Nolan was regimental quarter
master. He was considered one of the best officers in the field that ever
wore a uniform, and his great executive ability was recognized by his su
periors as well as those under his command. He married a Miss Klmball
of Chicago, and is survived by her and three small children. His funeral
will take place to-morrow. His body will be intered in the Presidio Ceme
tery with full military honors.

DECLINES TO

His Love Affairs.
TREASURY AGENT IN TROUBLE
HIS TYPEWRITER ADMITS THE
CALL'S STORY IS TRUE.
Collector Jackson Expects to Be Or
dered to Make an Investigation.
Another Victim Not a
typewriter.
Major Horace A. Moore, special agent
of the Treasury, with a too-demonstrative
admiration for his stenographer, was not
receiving callers yesterday with that cor
diality that formerly was -iiaracteristic
of the major. In fact, he was not receiv
ing anybody except such Federal officials
as found it necessary to visit him on de
partment matters.
The exposure in --"sterday's Call of the
major's moral shortcoming's had given
that venerable lothario a fearful shock,
and he kept the door leading to his pri
vate office tightly closed all day,
where before it always stood invit
ingly open. When newspaner men sought
to obtain a statement from him regarding
the charges that have gone on to Wash
ington, the major sent word to them by
his assistant that he had nothing to say
at present, and when a note was sent in
to him asking if he would deny the
charges, he sent back an answer that at
the proper time he would make his state
ment, practically admitting that he knew
the charges had gone on to Washington
and that he expected to be called to ac
count by the Treasury officials.
The young lad^y typewriter who was
subjected to his insults remained pluckiiy
at her post in the outer office, and thougn
naturally dreading the unpleasant noto
riety, frankly admitted that the charges
as outlined in The Call were true, and
that they had been forwarued to Wash
ington. Acting on the advice of her
friends she had determined to retain her
position, and if the department ordered
an investigation of Moore's con
duct she would unhesitatingly give her
testimony as to his outrageous conduct.
She corrected the statement that Kolla V.
Watt had helped her to secure her ap
pointment, although she said she had met
Air. Watt and was intimately acquainted
with his relatives.
Every employe of the Federal Govern
ment in the city, fro.ni heads of depart
ments to janitors chori ed over the ex
posure of Major Moore's misconduct, for
his actions have been notorious to all of
them, -and even this latest instance has
been gossiped by them for some days. Col

though he declined to say anything what
ever about the matter, or even acknowl
edge that he was aware that formal
charges had been preferred against
Moore, he explained that if the Treasury
Department should order an investigation
he would probably be the one selected to
conduct it, consequently it would De mani
festly improper to discuss the matter at
all.
Rolla V. Watt worked himself into a
tempter when asked to throw some light
on the charges and denied that he knew
anything about them or had ever heard
of the young lady in question, a statement
that party flatly contradicted when she
said she had met Mr. Watt. Then, al
though protesting that he would say abso
lutely nothing for publication. Mr. Watt
admitted that he knew Major Moore quite
well, and close questioning brought out
the admission that he had heard stories
of the major's improper conduct, but had
never paid any attention to them, nor had
he discussed them with the major.
Meanwhile the "Federal Brigade" con
tinued to chortle over the major's down
fall, for the. major's friends in the
red brick building are not numbered by
scores.
Moreover the evidence against the ma
jor is piling up. It appears that his fancy
turned lightly to others than typewriters
Now that The Call has done public ser-

strongly corroborative of the major's ai
leged little ways.
Not long ago a public official was
charged with a serious offense, but
after investigation by Major Moore was
exonerated. In the accused official's de
fense there testified his wife, a young 1
and buxnm lady, upon whom the major
cast sheep's eyes. After the investigation
he intimated that he would like to inter
rogate the lady in private. Eager to help
her husband the fair witness kept the
appointment, but was horrified when the
major looked the door and proposed cer
tain terms which she construed to
be the price of her husband's ex
oneration. With extreme difficulty
she escaped, but although the evi
dence against her husband was too weak
to convict him, she was not allowed to
elude the discriminating- eye of the secret
service agent. For months she was fol
lowed and importuned by Major Moore,
who tempted her with invitations of lit
tle dinners by the sea and other delights,
but all without avail. The fair wifew
scorned to yield to the advances of thep
man mean enough to take advantage of
his official position and she only confessed
ihe cruel persecution in the satisfaction
