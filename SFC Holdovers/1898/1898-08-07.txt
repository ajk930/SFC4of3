MUCH CONCERN OVER
CAPTAIN CLARK'S ILLNESS
Although Hia Collapse May Not Be
Permanent, Barker Is to Com
mand the Oregon.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6.â A good deal
of concern is felt at the Navy Depart
ment at the breakdown of Captain
Clark of the Oregon. Not the slight
est information has reached here of the
nature of the captain's illness; all that
is known Is that Commodore Watson,
â  his immediate superior, ordered a med
ical board to examine him with thÂ» re
sult that he was condemned and or-
I dered home. It does not follow from
this that the captain's collapse is per
manent and his splendid physique and
usually vigorous health afford general
belief that he will regain his health in
the north. Captain Barker, who was
in command of the Newark, has been
assigned to the command of the Ore
gon in place of Captain Clark. The
' vacancy on the Newark has not b* n
I filled as yet. Captain Barker was one
of the original of the Naval Board and
in that capacity rendered valuable ser
vice in preparing the navy for the ei
cfU^nt work accomplished by it. He
commanded the Oregon while she was
attached to the Pacific station, preced
ing Captain Clark.
WARSHIPS REPAIRED

GUANTANAMO BAY. July 31.â For

ALL PEACE
CONDITIONS
ACCEPTED
Madrid Cabinet Approves
Basis of t\)e Reply to
McKjQley.
Hostilities May End by Monday
or Tuesday When Official Dec
laratioos fire Expected.
MADRID, Aug. 6.â The Cabinet to-day approved the
basis of the reply to the peace conditions proposed by
the United States.
Duke Almodovar de Rio, the Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, is charged with revising the reply, which will be
read and approved at the Cabinet council to-morrow
morning.
It is stated on good authority that the Spanish reply
will give no occasion for a further response to the United
States.
OFFICIALS BELIEVE THE
WAR WILL SOON BE OVER
NEW YORK, Aug. 6. â The Herald s Washington corre
spondent sends the following: Convinced more than a week ago
that Spain had determined to have peace at any price, the semi
official announcement from Madrid to-night that the Cabinet
has approved the basis of the reply to the peace conditions im
posed by this country is accepted by administration officials as
authentic. The general verdict in official circles here to-night
is that the war is over, with only the formalities necessary before
an official declaration is made. This will probably not happen
before Monday or Tuesday.
No official word had reached
the President up to a late hour
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
to-night of Spain's acceptance of
our terms. Embassador Cambon,
I have reason to believe, has had
confirmation through diplomatic
channels of the press reports
about Spain's acceptance, but he
will not be prepared to makeafor
mal announcement to the Presi
dent until the full text of the
note, which the Madrid Cabinet
has been at work upon to-day,
is cabled to him. There is no
doubt as to the accuracy of the
Madrid cable to the effect that
Spain's reply will give no reason
for further response by the
United States. The fact is, the
administration will not permit
any further dickering for terms..
The President was emphatic
on this point at the time of his
last conference with Embassador
Cambon.
In view of the announcement
from Madrid, therefore, it is as
sumed that Spain has recognized
the futility of further attempts to
secure better terms and that the
Madrid Cabinet has determined
to accept all the conditions im
posed by the United States.
All that remains now for bring
ing about the cessation of hostili
ties is the promulgation of a pro
tocol embodying the terms pro
posed by the United States and
accepted by Spain. This will be
done as soon as Embassador
Cambon presents the note being
prepared in Madrid to-day.
Secretary Day and Embassa
dor Cambon have already con
ferred as to the details of the pro
posed protocol. There will, there
fore, be little delay in its promul
gation. The terms proposed by
the United States will be em
bodied in the protocol in the
same language given in the first2
note to Spain, with one or two
â  minor changes.
SPAIN'S REPLY HAS
NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6.â Just a week
ago to-day Embassador Cambon re
ceived from the President the terms of
peace that would be granted by the
United States. When the State Depart
ment closed its doors this afternoon
the Spanish Government had not signi
fied whether or not it was prepared to
accept these conditions. Every day
during the past week an answer has
been expected, and that same feeling
of expectancy prevailed at the close of
the week. It is significant that all re
sponsible Government officials are sat
isfied the reply will be an acceptance of
our terms when it does come.
About 2:30 o'clock Secretary Thiebault
of the French Embassy called at the
State Department, thus giving rise to
the supposition that he was seeking to
make an appointment for the Embasaa
dor to meet the President to deliver
the Spanish answer. This, however,
turned out to be erroneous. M. Thle
bault's business being connected with
Borne of the recent seizures of French
merchant vessels by the blockading
fleet and relating in no way to the
Spanish peace negotiations. The fact
that Secretary Day, who had contem
plated a trip to Atlantic City this after
noon, did not leave town, was also the
basis for another guess that he had no
tice the Spanish note was coming im
mediately and that his presence would
be required here. As a matter of fact,
the Secretary was detained beyond his
train time by his reception of the Ital
ian Embassador. who had a long con
ference over the Cerruti case.
Altogether, though the expectation of
an early answer is still cherished, it
was the belief of the officials, when the
day closed, that there was little
likelihood of its receipt by the Presi
dent before Monday. It was rumored
In some quarters that the Spanish Gov
ernment had sent along a notice that
it had accepted the principal American
terms and would be prepared to make
formal answer Monday, but the French
Embassy, which would be the only re
cipient of any such notice, gave a very
Quick and effective denial of this story.
While all this delay is deprecated, it
is realized that Sagasta probably is
making the struggle of his life to bring
the Spanish party leaders to the
where they will agree to stand by him
in his acceptance of the terms of seace.
This fact tends to secure the md ll
gence of our Government in some de
gree and this is more readily extendad
In consideration of the fact that so far
from having surrendered any advanÂ»
tage in agreeing to discuss terms of
peace, we are gaining something sub
stantial every day in the prosecution
of the campaign as revealed by the re
ports from Porto Rico. The naval plans
of operations are also moving steadily
forward, and notwithstanding state
ments to the effect that the projected
cruise against the Spanish coast by the
Eastern squadron has been abandoned
Secretary Long stated this afternoon |
that no change had been made in the
plan of the department respecting that
squadron. â __
CUBAN DEBT ONE
BONE OF CONTENTION
LONDON, Aug. 7.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Sunday Times says:
Spain's answer will accept all the
American terms except that regarding
the Cuban debt. The Government will
fight this point on the ground that in
all other cessions of territory by one
Government to another the ceded terri
tory hus carried with it its own debt or
the proportion belonging to the nation
by which it is ceded.
President McKinley will receive the
answer un Monday or at the latest on
Tuesday. Senor Sagaata, in conference
with politicians and generals, follows
the example of Senor Castellar in 1873.
His objects are twofoldâ to provide the
responsibility for the decision and to
avoid the convocation of the Cortes.
The news from Porto Rico is received
with great disappointment. The Span
iards are disgusted with the welcome
the natives have given the Americans
and the news that the volunteers have
thrown their arms down. The general
opinion is that it is not worth while to
risk lives and spend millions for the
sake of territories which are worse than
disloyal to the mother country. It is
assumed that there will be no inter
national troubles over the evacuation
of the West Indies. The war has cost
$350,000,000.
EMBASSADOR CAMBON
WAITS UNTIL MIDNIGHT
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6.â Spain's ans
wer to the American demands was not
received by the French Embassador up
to midnight to-night. M. Cambon and
his staff, who had been awaiting it
through the evening, at that hour were
convinced that it would not arrive be
fore to-morrow and the Embassador re
tired and the members of his staff went
to their homes.
Celebrating Over the News.
GRASS VALLEY, Aug. 6.â This city
1b to-night in a blaze of glory over the
news of Spain's acceptance of the terms
of peace. Four hundred dollars' worth
of fireworks purchased in Sacramento
were received to-night and are being
set off, creating a perfect din and light
ing the heavens with magnificent and
variagated colors. When the news was
first received this morning expressions
of joy were given vent to by shouts of
the people, the blowing of whistles and
the ringing of bells.
ALGER DEFENDS THE
SEVENTY-FIRST NEW YORK
He States Information Has Reached
Him That There Were Extenu
ating Circumstances.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6.â Secretary
Alger states that the information
reaching him shows that there were ex
tenuating circumstances in the case of
â¢nose troops of the Seventy-first New
York Regiment, accused in General
Kent's report of not advancing
promptly to the attack on Santiago.
Men returning from Santiago have
told the Secretary that the irregularity
occurred amid the noise and confusion
of the opening of the engagement, when
the enemy were directing a heavy fire
against this point of our lines, where
a number of our troops carried black
powder guns instead of the more serv
icable Krag-Jorgensens.
While the Secretary does not seek to
Justify the regiment, yet he feels that
they are entitled to have their course
viewed in the light of all the adverse
circumstances which operated against
them at the time of the battle.
â  Speaking of the Porto Rico campaign
the Secretary said that the entire force
would be supplied with. Krag-Jorgen
sen guns or else smokeless powder to
use in such few Springflelds as might
be carrried in connection with the
Krag-Jorgensens. The purpose, how
ever, is to arm the active troops as rap-
Idly as possible with the high-class
modern arm.

ONLY DREW A
DEADLY FIRE
Military Balloon Caused
Heavy Loss.
DECIDEDLY NOT A SUCCESS
SUCH THE OPINION OF ONE OF
THE SANTIAGO OFFICERS.
Claims That the Aerial Machine Led
to the Killing of 300 American
Troops and the Wound
ing of 700.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 6.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: There
have been different opinions touching
the experiment of the military balloon
at Santiago. Some officers in Wash
ington, including General Greely, have
not hesitated to pronounce in its favor,
but one of the officers who was in the
fighting line at Santiago and who was
an eye witness of what he describes
takes a different view. He thinks the
balloon was a failure at every point,
and traces the death of 300 men and
the wounding of 700 directly to it. The
officer Baid to-day:
"Imagine thousands of men on the
narrow road leading to the front. They
are pushing and pulling along through
the dirt and mud. Fortunately they
are sheltered from the enemy's fire, for
in the dense tropical growth nothing
can be seen. The infantry is pushing
along wearily when word comes for
them to draw to one side so as to make
way for the advancing cavalry divi
sions. The infantry is drawn up in a
mass In small brigades in the field
alongside the road, and the dismounted
cavalry has the right of way on the
narrow road.
"Then there is seen coming up the
road, swaying to and fro Just above the
tree tops, the American military bal
loon. With it comes a perfect rain of
Spanish small arms, projectiles and
shrapnel. They do not injure the bal
loon, but they do create havoc among
the poor troupers standing there. The
balloon has no occupant, but it draws
the Spanish fire just the same. A cable
is tied to a tree trunk, and this is car
ried along by some soldiers or signal
corps men. It keeps up the road,
pointing out as well as it can the posi
tion of our helpless troops. The cav
alry has now passed and the infantry
is again set in motion. It is accom
panied on its march to the front by the
balloon which again acts as a signal
to the Spaniards to direct their fire.
Finally the firing line is reached. Here
the balloon is hauled down, and Col
onel Derb-i- of the engineers enters the
car. Its reappearance brings forth
a new fusillade from the Spanish lines.
"The balloon parades up and down our
firing line, the line thus being exactly
marked out for the Spaniards. A shot,
fortunately for our soldiers, finally
punctures the balloon and she comes
down. The daring aeronaut climbs out
of the car uninjured, and has some
valuable information, but at what
cost? Three hundred deaths and 700
wounded are directly traceable to the
doings of the balloon."
SECRETARY ALGER TALKS
OF HIS FURTHER PLANS
NEW YORK, Aug. 6.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Secretary Alger to-day talked
somewhat freely of his further plan 3.
In reply to my question, the Secretary
said the army of General Miles was
now supplied with Krag-Jorgensens;
that 20,000 of these rifles have been sent
j with the expedition. However, unless
! smokeless powder is forhcoming for
the Springfields, more Krag-Jorgensens
will be sent. The remains of the first
Porto Rican expedition, about 10,000
men, are yet to go from iVewDort
News and Tampa, and then the second
expedition to Porto Rico under Major-
General Wade.
"Yes this expedition will go just as
soon as possible," said General Alger.
"It has not been abandoned; we are
waiting to have the men brought from
Santiago to Montauk Point, so as to
have the transports available for Gen
eral Wade's troops."
"In case of peace?" I asked.
"We are now proceeding on a war
'â¢ basis," replied the War Secretary, "as
; if there were no negotiations for peace;
j if I knew there was peace now, I should
I not be willing to say what then would
be the programme."
"What will be the object of so many
troops in Porto Rico?"
"There will be many things for them
'to do; protect the American interests
in the event of a provisional govern
ment or a military government, or
whatever you choose to call it, or dis
tribute supplies; to do many thinÃÃ
Provisional regiments will be sent to
Cuba to take the place of Shafter's
army, and all preparations will be
shaped toward a Havana campaign in
the fall, as if no peace negotiations
were in hand."
DELAY IN TRANSPORTING
THE SPANISH PRISONERS
NE ft YORK, Aug. 6.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: One rea
son why the Spanish transports are
not yet ready to take on prisoners
for Spain is that one of them, the Ali
cante from Martinique, got crippled on
the way; two others had on contraband
of war and there was difficulty in get
ting a landing. This was the explana
tion given me this afternoon by an of
ficial in charge at the War Department.
Seven Spanish transports should have
been at Santiago in readiness to take
the prisoners. None are there. Mean
while General Shafter's army has been
kept waiting as he was not willing to
leave the prisoners. On the lowest
basis the delay of the transports be-
Fides having detained the army is
costing the Government nearly $10,000 a
day.
GENERAL ROY STONE'S
ADVANCE ON UTUADO
PONCE, Porto Rico, Aug. 6, via St.
Thomas. â General Roy Stone is clear
ing the road from Adjuntas to Utuado.
He has a force of 500 natives at work.
A company of the Second Wisconsin
and a battalion of the Nineteenth Reg
ular Infantry are moving to his sup
port. A considerable force of Span
ish is reported to the northwest and
frequent alarms are given, but there
has been no fight as yet. There is
much activity among the troops here.
The Massachusetts was floated last
night and will proceed to Arroyo to
day.
The cavalry troops will go overland
if peace is declared. The plans of the
army are to cross the island, and they
will probably be unmolested.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 7, 189 S.
To our navy has been added another formidable warship, the Chicago. This cruiser was floated out of the dry
dock in the Brooklyn Navy Yard last week, and practically is a new ship. The only old thing about her is her
hull. Her old engines and boilers have been replaced by new ones, two manganese bronze propellers have replaced
the screw, and new boilers, electric plants and fighting tops have been placed in position. She is now being sup
plied with new batteries of large and rapid-fire guns, replacing the slow ones she carried in other years. She will
go into commission in a few days.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Aug. 6.â A mass meeting of
citizens of Springfield will be held In
the City Hall next week, when it will be
decided to enter a formal protest at the
War Department against the neglect
of soldiers in Santiago and the hard
ships they have been enduring, and to
demand the immediate return of the
Second Massachusetts to its native
heath.
Recent events at the front have
aroused the wrath of the citizens, and
this step was decided upon at a meet
ing of a committee on soldiers' aid held
in the Board of Trade rooms. The mass
meeting was called for to-night, but
was postponed because of the absence
of some speakers.
All soldiers who have returned from
the front will occupy seats on the plat
form. Resolutions will be presented
by Herbert Myrick, Mrs. Edsea R.
Whiting of the Union Relief Associa
tion and John McLean. The resolu
tions will allege that the boys gave up
good homes to fight for their country
and have received so far the most cruel
treatment. General Shafter will be
scored, and it will be urged that the
boys are no longer needed at Santiago
and should not longer be detained in
constant exposure to the deadliest dis
ease of the tropics.
Congressman Gillett, James B. Car

Brown will be among the speakers.
Congressman Gillett and William R.

Many Demands of Insurgents for
Damages Done Date Back
Many Years.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 6.â The announce
ment that the United States Government
will assume liability for the claims of the
insurgents against the Spanish Govern
ment on account of injuries and damages
sustained in the Cuban insurrection has
caused the filing of a large number of
claims with the State Department. Very
many of these are not based on events
occurring during the last rebellion, but
date back many years, and relate to dam
ages sustained through municipal mal
administration and such things.
On the other hand, there are now Span
ish claims to the amount of $8,000.0)0
against the United States. A large num
ber of these claims are made by Spanish
citizens on account of property destroyed
or appropriated by the Confederate
troops during the Civil War, thus having
exactly the same basis as a number of
claims filed by American citizens against
the Spanish Government for property
seized or destroyed by insurgents in
Cuba. , Â ,_
It is believed to be probable, however,
that in the adjustment of peace terms
our Government will ignore all claims
save those preferred by American citi
zens for losses sustained in Cuba, allow
ing the others to be arranged for later
on by a joint committee.
AMERICAN FORCES
TO AF^OhD PROTECTION
Catholic Clergy of the Philippines to
Receive the Same Consideration
as Other Non-Combatants.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6.â lnasmuch
as It has been stated that the Arch
bishop of Manila has been directed by
the Vatican to place himself and his
clergy under the protection of the
American commanders, it may be
THE U. S. S. CHICAGO.
stated that such protection will be
afforded on exactly the same terms and
conditions that it will be extended to
the clergymen of all denominations and
to all non-combatants in Manila and
the remainder of the Philippines.
It is known that the insurgents have
particularly singled out the Catholic
clergy as the objects of their vengeance
without doubt inspired by the assist
ance afforded to the Spanish authori
ties by the priests and friars in their
efforts to repres? the rebellion in ita
earlier stages. However, so long as the
clergy refrain from taking up arms in
the Spanish cause the American com
manders, naval and military, will af
ford them Buch protection as the lights
of civilized warfare require.
Already General Merritt has been in
structed by cable to investigate re
ports that some monks were made pris
oners by the Insurgents and were about
to be executed. This report came to the
War Department from, Catholic: sources
and appears, according to Consul Gen
eral Williams' report, to be erroneous.
Still, had it turned out that the insur
gents were about to violate the rules of
civilization in this fashion, General
Merritt would have promptly and
firmly interposed, even though the re
sult had been to cause a rupture be
tween himself and the insurgents.
CANNOT VISIT THE
HOME OF HOBSON
Admiral Cervera Says He Must Re
turn to Spain Immediately the
War Is Over.
MOBILE, Aug. 6. â In reponse to an
Invitation extended in the name of the
people of Greensboro, Ala., to visit
Lieutenant Hobson's home, Admiral
Cervera writes under date erf August 2,
saying:
"I thank you very much, and also the
citizens of Greensboro, for the kind ex
pressions contained in your letter, and
you will allow me to say that it is I
who should render thanks (which I do
with the greatest pleasure) for the kind
and generous treatment which I am re
ceiving at the hands of the American
people, and it would be gratifying to
me to accept your invitation to visit
Greensboro, where was born the brave
Lieutenant Richmond Pearson Hobson,
but it would be impossible for me to
do so, for as soon as the war is ended
it will be obligatory upon me to return
immediately to Spain to account for my
conduct, which must be judged as pro
vided for by the law. Nevertheless, I
shall not fail to carry through all life
the remembrance of such brave officers
as Lieutenant Hobson, and also the
nattering invitation tendered me by the
city of his birth.
"I subscribe myself, etc.,

GOOD HEALTH OF THE
MARINES AND SEAMEN
Sampson Makes a Beport on the Con
dition of the Men in His
Command.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6.â The Secre
tary of the Navy to-night made pub
lic the following telegram from Admi
ral Sampson:
"PLATA, Aug. 6.â Marine Battalion
is in excellent health. Sick list num
bers 2y 2 per cent. Fleet surgeon re
ports that they are In better condition
for service in this climate than they
were when they first arrived south in
June. Health of the squadron at Guan
tanamo fairly good. Sick list numbers
about 3 per cent. General tone of health
of the ship's company has fallen con
siderably since the first of July. This,
however, is not due to the prevalence
of any disease, but is probably due to
the release from the strain and con
stant effort under which they so long
lived: and to this probably more than
to any other cause is due their some
what impaired physique. I do not think
it necessary to send the marine battal
ion north. The crews have borne their
privations in a manner beyond praise;
three ships have not been ashore for
three months in a debilitating climate.
"SAMPSON."
Secretary Long stated to-night that
it- is the purpose of the department to
order north those ships which are not
required for blockade as soon as the
exigencies of the war will permit.
GENERAL WOOD WILL
CUT PROVISION PRICES
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 6.âGen
eral Leonard Wood, the Military Gov
ernor of Santago, this afternoon called a
meeting of the butchers and retail pro
vision dealers of the city, with the ob
ject of formulating a tariff for the sale
of necessaries of life, for which the deal
ers have lately been charging exorbitant
rates. All the dealers were highly in
dignant at the Interference of the mili
tary authority in commercial matters,
but General Wood gave them until 11
o'clock to-morrow morning to agree on
moderate prices, under penalty of a re
vocation of their licenses and the closing
of their shops. A permanent scale of
prices will be fixed to-morrow.

GIBRALTAR, Aug. 6.â A Cadiz mer

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 6.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: It Is the intention of the
Navy Department to increase Rear Ad
miral Dewey's squadron as promptly
as possible, so there will be nothing for
this Government to fear in the Far
East.
President McKinley and Secretary
Long are naturally desirous of putting
the officers and men of the ships now
In Cuban waters in the best possible
condition as promptly as possible, and
immediately upon the acceptance of the
President's terms instructions will be
sent to Rear Admiral Sampson direct
ing him to order north such of the ves
sels of his command as can be spared.
This is the explanation of the depart
ment's announcement that the vessels
would be brought north "as soon as the
exigencies of the war would permit."
But while appreciating the value of
improving the health of the ship's com
panies, the authorities dare not dis
band the fleet at Guantanamo until as
surances are given by Spain of her ac
ceptance of the President's terms.
In any event it is confidently expect
ed the matter will be decided one way
or another by Tuesday at the latest, so
the ships will start either on their way
to Spain or to northern waters by the
middle of the coming week.
NAVY'S PART IN THE
WAR IS ABOUT OVER
Suicide by Shooting of Chief Master
at-Arms Gratz of the Battle
ship Oregon.
PLATA DEL ESTE, Guantanamo
Bay, Aug. 6.â The marine camp here
was broken up on the afternoon of
August 5, and the marine battalion was
transferred to the auxiliary cruiser
Resolute for service in other parts of
Cuba. The main body of the fleet will
remain here ready for any kind of ser
vice, awaiting orders from Washington.
The idea rather gains ground that the
navy's active part in the war is near
ly over.
Chief Master-at-Arms Gratz of the
battle-ship Oregon committed suicide
yesterday by shooting.
The Scorpion has arrived from Cien
fuegos. Lieutenant Commander Ma
rix confirms the previous reports of
starvation in this section of the coast.
Lieutenant Commander Marix said
that Naval Cadet Combs, who has not
yet graduated, but is doing duty on the
Scorpion, is down with malarial fever.
While the Scorpion was off Manza
nillo, with the temperature at 105 de
grees, "general quarters" was sounded
suddenly. Cadet Combs rushed from
his sick bed to his station, stark naked,
but with his sword buckled around his
waist. This plucky young officer will
have to be sent home to recuperate.
CAPTURE OF A MURDERER.
Arrested for Swindling a Woman Out
of Fifteen Dollars.
ST. LOUIS, Aug. 6.â Last Wednesday a
man grivlng his name as Jack Wilson
was arrested for swindling a woman out
of $15 by "short change" methods, after
jumping into a near-by buggy, holding a
revolver at the driver's head and giving
his pursuers a furious chase.
To-day the Bertillon system convinced
the police that Wilson is Pat Crowe,
wanted in Denver, Colo.-, for murder and
also for burglary. Crowe served three
years for train robbery in Missouri.
Chief Campbell to-day received informa
tion that Crowe was wanted in Omaha for
burglary. Crowe admitted hia identity
but would not talk.
EMPEROR WILLIAM
SHOWS TACT IN THE
FACE OF REBUFFS
Actions of Bismarck's Family
Concerning the Funeral Cause
a Sensation in Germany.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Aug. 6.â The death of
Prince Bismarck has, of course, en
grossed public attention throughout the
week. While it cannot be truthfully
be said that the oppression created by
the sudden death of the great Chan
cellor was as deep as would have been
expected and while there was nothing
like general mourning visible in Ber
lin, yet there were unmistakable evi
dences of widespread sympathy.
The publications and revelations
which so quickly followed the death of
the Prince have naturally created a
sensation and deep anger in Govern
ment circles, and there is still greater
surprise and resentment at the atti
tude of the Bismarck family. The Em
peror left nothing undone that could
testify to his personal grief or the
sense of greatness of the loss to Ger
many. His proclamation addressed to
the Imperial Chancellor, Prince Hohen
lohe, has given high satisfaction
tbioughout the country, and it is gener
ally admitted magnanimity was required
to enable his Majesty to preserve such
unruffled serenity in the face of the evi
dent sullenness of the family. He de
vised most splendid public honors for
the deceased statesman, and when his j
efforts to place the latter's remains be
side his grandfather's were refused the
Emperor carried out what was possible
in the shape of a public funeral, re
gardless of the absence of any of the
Bismarcks. On the whole Emperor
William has shown great tact in the
face of open rebuffs.
The Vossische Zeitung, referring to
the matter, says: "We do not wish to
pass judgment and only chronicle facts.
The notice of the death addressed to the
Emperor did not bear the signature of
the son, but of the doctor. The Em
peror commanded Professor Begas to
take a cast of the features, but the
emissary of the sculptor was obliged
to leave Friedrichsruhe without fulfill
ing his mission. The Emperor desired
to see the body, but the coffin was
closed before he could do so, although,
according to the testimony of Professor
Lenbach, neither were the features of
Prince Bismarck disfigured nor were
there any signs of decomposition. When
the monarch arrived at Friedrichsruhe
the ex-Minister of State, Prince Her
bert, did not appear in uniform or wear
his decorations, but appeared only as
a private gentleman. It cannot be but
that the nation will have drawn defi
nite inferences from these facts."
But it was not against the Emperor
alone that Prince Bismarck's family
acted. The reigning German Princes,
the peers and the nation were prevent
ed from taking any part in the funeral.
To the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar
and to the Grand Dukes of Hesse and
Oldenburg Prince Herbert wired to
remain away. Even Prince Hohenlohe,
although a personal friend of the de
ceased, and whose coming had been
heralded in time, was not allowed to
see the body. The coffin was soldered
down fifteen minutes before his ar
rival, to the intense sorrow of the aged
Chancellor.
Persons who were present in the
house at the time affirm that Prince
Herbert issued orders to solder the
coffin down as soon as the telegram
from the Emperor arrived announcing
his Majesty's coming to Friedrichsruhe.
A number of German papers affirm
that the causes for all this strange be
havior are partly because Prince Her
bert is seriously unwell and partly be
cause there were about the house a
large number of highly important and
sensational papers, mostly letters to
Prince Bismarck, and that there was
fear that these would be stolen in the
bustle and turmoil occasioned by the
crowds of visitors.
The order countermanding the public
obsequies was received here with con
sternation.
The Bismarck family, on their part,
gave out that the peculiar method of
conducting the arrangements for
Prince Bismarck's temporary interment
were wholly in conformity with hlg
wishes, adding that the deceased had
remarked that he "wanted a rest, at
least after death."
The correspondent here of the Asso
ciated Press had an interview with the
Foreign Office officials regarding all
these matters, and the following state
ment was made to him: "As to the
Emperor countermanding his first or
der regarding the public obsequies,
there was no specific reason for it. As
to the epitaph, it is known that it was
Prince Bismarck's wish to have it so
worded, and we cannot hinder it. As
to the memoirs, there is no anticipation
upon the part of the Government that
any unpleasantness will result from
their publication, and there is no inten
tion to stop them."
Among the public testimonials will be
a gigantic demonstration at Nieder
wald, arranged by a number of Rhen
ish cities, and a large memorial meet
ing takes place at Stuttgart and an
other at Hamburg, where a public sub
scription has been opened for the erec
tion of a gigantic monument to Prince
Bismarck at Sachsenwald.
There will be similar ceremonies at
Breslau, Dresden, Leipsig, Leibnitz,
Augsburg, Munich, Carlsruhe, Koe
nigsberg and many other cities.
From the Germans in Austria many
signs of sympathy have come. In Up
per Austria, at a large representative
meeting in Wols, a resolution %vas pass
ed to wear black corn flowers until
Sunday.

Augustine Louise of Saxe-Coburg and
Duke Ernest Gunther of Schleswlg-
Holsteiiv brother of the Empress of
Germany has caused a great deal of
discussion in the ultramontane press.
The Cologne Yolks Zeitung says: "The
priest committed a grave breach oÂ£
faith and the Princess was guilty, by
marrying according to the Protestant
rite, of a deadly sin."
The Augsburg Post Zeitung says:
"The Coburg family has been guilty or
another public nuisance."
Owing to the death of Prince Bis
marck the German newspapers this
week have paid but little attention to
the progress of the war between Spain
and the United States. The Evangeli
cal Church Gazette, though, in a lead
ing editorial, remarks: "The outcome
of the war is a triumph for Protestant
ism and further proof of the deterior
ation of the Latin races."
Continuing, the paper mentioned then
points in proof of its assertions to the
successive defeats of the Austrian,
French and Spanish nations. For thia
the leading organ of the German Cath
olics, the Cologne Yolks Zeitung, takes
the Evangelical Church Gazette very
severely to task, arguing that Catholi
cism had noihing to <_o with the defeats
referred to.
Generally speaking, the German press
expresses confidence that the war is
about over and that the conditions of
peace are acceptable to Spain and that
the latter would do well to conclude
peace forthwith.

was the dancing of the little boys and
girls in costume. The evening was spent
in dancing: in the open air, which was
marred a trifle, however, by a light thun

Spaniards Surprise a Lost Newspaper Man by
Volunteering to Turn Over the Town
of Comao.
PONCE, Porto Blco, Aug. 5, by Call-Herald dispatch-boat to St Thomas, D. W. 1., Aug. 6.â The
gTotesqueness of the Porto Bican campaign cannot be illustrated better than by narrating an incident
which has happened to a Call-Herald correspondent, T. F. Millard. Mr. Millard accidentally stumbled
into the Spanish lines at Comao. He had been deserted for some reason by his Porto Rican escort, and
had been left aloae wandering. While endeavoring to reach a point of safety he fell into the Spanish
outposts. He was surrounded by officers and men of the enemy. At first Mr. Millard believed that he
had been made a prisoner, but the peaceful attitude of the soldiers assured him he was not to be dealt
with in a drastic manner. After a parley of a few moments, to Mr. Millard's great surprise, the Span
ish officers agreed to surrender. The visitor managed to conceal his astonishment at the turn of affairs,
and began negotiating. The Spanish officers agreed to retire the next day and permit the American
troops to advance. When the Call-Herald correspondent reported that the enemy would surrender the
town General Miles declined to take a serious view of the matter.

wholesale dealers were also reduced about
30 per cent.

BALD AND COOPER
MATCHED AT A MILE
INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 6.â Arrangements
are now nearing completion for the nine
teenth annual meet of the League of
American Wheelmen, which will open in
this city next Tuesday. Most of the crack
riders are now at the New by Oval track,
pronounced by all the fastest upon which
national championships have ever been
contested.
One of the greatest matches ever made
since cycling became a sport was com
pleted this afternoon, when Eddie Bald of
Baffnlo, the champion for the last three
years, and Tom Cooper of Detroit, his
greatest rival, signed cne articles of
agreement that w!U bring them together
in a great mile match race at the Newby
Oval next Friday night.
After the usual trouble incident to
match-making the men were finally in
duced to bet $250 each on themselves and
to race for a $500 purse, making the en
tire purse $1000, which will be taken by
the winner, the loser getting nothing.
The conditions of the match call for a
mile race, best two heats in three. The
first heat Is to be unpaced or European
style, the second heat to be paced by
single rider, who will drop out at the
bell tap, and the third heat, if necessary,
will be decided by tosa.

addition to United States territory, passed
through Â£>gden to-day en route to San
Francisco and the Hawaiian Islands. All

Men He Would Place in
Office.
3 OLITICAL DEBTS TO BE PAID:
CHE "BOSS" TO MAKE A HARD
FIGHT.
Rallying His Forces for an Attempt
to Carry the Primaries by Any
Means That Is Deemed
Necessary.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 6.â The political pot
la beginning to boil in Santa Clara
bounty, and already the aroma of the
programmed broth has reached the
public, which has evidenced its dls
:aste. With Rea as chef and John and
A.ndy Mackenzie as dishwashers their
mess will be of the same old kind that
has been served the public year after
year.
The voters have decided that the old
â dtehen crow must be ousted and a new
political regime begun â one that will
command the respect and indorsement
of the best people. This is the only
ftny the county can be saved to the
Republican party.
"Boss" Kea has decided that he must
carry the primaries next Wednesday
and control the county convention on
August 13. After the "rolling" he re
vived at the hands of Major McLaugh
;in and the State Committee the "boss"
tvill leave nothing undone to secure the
upper hand In the convention. He fig
ures that this is necessary in order to
3how the people that he has some pres
tige still left. Orders have gone out
among his henchmen to carry the pri
maries by all means. Democrats have
been importuned to vote at the Repub
lican primary, and if by this means
there is not sufficient power to break
the force of the wave of condemnation
that has arisen over the actions of Rea
and the Mackenzie's the ballot boxes
will be stuffed.
Outside the city Rea has aÂ«hard fight
on his hands, and it is doubtful if he
will elect any of the delegates from the
:ountry. At Gilroy a bitter fight is be
ing made against George E. Rea,
jrother of the "boss," who represents
that district on the Board of Super
visors. The town of Santa Clara pre
sents an equally strong opposition to
;he ringsters. This condition of affairs
.n the outside districts is due to the
organized work of the Good Govern
ment Club. That organization will
lave a. ticket in the field, and present
ndications point to a victory for it in
:hese precincts. In the four wards of
the city the ring has things pretty
triuch its own way, but with a full vote
of the Republicans Rea would be de
feated.
A close watch will be kept to see that
none of the usual crooked methods
known to bosses are applied next Wed
nesday to defeat the wishes of the
people.
. The county ticket slated by "Boss"
Rea for nomination at the Republican
convention is as follows:
For Superior Judgt>â J. C. Black, who
is to be "knifed" by the gang in the in
terest of V. A. Scheller, the probable
nominee of the Democratic party.
For Sheriffâ Robert J. Langfnrd.
Langford is at presc-nt a member of
the City Board of Education, and it
was the promise of the Sheriff's office
that caused him to stand in with Rea
on the dismissal of Professor L. R.
Smith from the High School and Mrs.
A. B. Clement from the office of As
sistant and City Superintendent of
Schools.
County Clerk â Rush McComa?. This
nomination is in payment for work
done for the gang as a member of the
appointing board under the new char
ter.
County Treasurer â Joseph Lotz, in
cumbent.
County Auditor â W. F. Parker, In
cumbent. This nominee was opposed
by the gang last time and was elected
as an independent. The fact that he
has not refused to audit Game Warden
Mackenzie's warrants â as other Audi
tors throughout the State have done
with claims of Game Wardens and been
upheld by the court3 â secured for him
this favor.
County Assessor â Ex - Supervisor
Adolph Greenin^er. This individual
boasts that he delivers 95 per cent of
the German vote to Rea and Mackenzie
tvery year.
The Tax Collector's office will either
be given to W. C. Hamilton or Charles
Barker. The former is an old mem
ber of the School Board and Barker has
furnished the schools with coal for
years.
For District Attorneyâ B. A. Herring
ton, incumbent.
County Superintendent of Schools â
H. C. Faber of Palo Alto.
Coroner and Pubic Administrator â J.
"X, Secord, incumbent.
County Recorder â Charles P. Owen,
who has held the office several terms
.a-nd who promised in the last conven
tion that if nominated he would not
ask for the office again.
Township Trusteesâ W. J. Kirkpat
rlck and W. T. Xolting.
City Justiceâ J. W. Gass.
Constablesâ Ed Haley and H. F.
Plummer.
Supervisors â First District, George E.

is in readiness to combat the Rea forces
at the primaries on Wednesday. There
was a large attendance and great en
thusiasm prevailed. The coming elec
tions were discussed at length and all
arrangements made by members for
work among the voters on that day. It
was freely expressed that no ballot box
stuffing would be permitted by the
gang which has been running munici
pal affairs, and that any attempt at
crookedness would be resisted with
force if necessary.
The attempt of "Boss" Rea to harass
Superintendent of Schools Chipman by
having the Board of Supervisors reject
his bills came in for a good scoring.
Strong addresses were delivered by
prominent members present. It was
stated that the bills of Game Warden
Mackenzie for the full amount of ex
penses allowed by law were never ques
tioned, while the modest expense bills
of Chipman were thrown out. The per
secution of Chipman was referred to as
similar to that of ex-County Clerk Bor
ing. In the latter's case an expert put
into his office by the gang had found
a shortage of $6500, while the findings
of the Commissioner before whom tes
timony was taken showed a shortage
of only $39 35, and this through clerical
errors.
Strong men have been put up as del
egates in all precincts of the county,
and the Good Government Club is con
fident of success at the primaries.

INTEREST CENTERING IN THE
STATE CONVENTION.
Sacramento Clubs Make Extensive
Preparations for the Accom
modation of Delegates
and Visitors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 6.â The ap
proaching Republican convention prom
ises to excel all previous political gath
erings in this State in interest and im
portance. In this part of California
there is unusual interest manifested.
At the same time everybody seems to
be in a state of doubt and expectancy.
There is an absence of concentration
upon any one point or person when the
gubernatorial question is broached. All
minds meet in the concession of Ma
gulre's forlorn hope, but when it
comes to the question who shall profit
from his certain defeat no one hazards
a reply or gives expression to a
choice.
The people in these parts are going
to be wonderfully tolerant this year,
I and the only desire they seem to have
is one for a good, strong, energetic Re
publican, whose election will serve >-S
a message of commendation to Presi
dent McKinley and incidentally dispose
of many-sided Maguire.
Great preparations are being made
for the proper reception of the dele
gates and visitors in general on the
23d inst. The pavilion is being put
into order for both conventions, and
from experience in the past the com
mittee in charge will be in a position
|to provide most handsomely for the
! accommodation of all concerned. The
i various Republican clubs throughout
the city have united in a plan of enter
tainment which will consist of a high
Jinks or smoker at the old pavilion on
the first night of the convocation. An
elaborate programme is being arranged
and a grand rally of visiting Republi-
I cans is looked forward to. The clubs'
j reception committee has arranged for
i headquarters at the Golden Eagle dur
ing the convention, where all visitors
will be welcomed and provided for.
The Captain McKinley Club will
have charge of the ratification meeting
following the nominations.
Never before in the history of Sacra
mento has there been such an over
whelming demand for accommodations
in advance of a coming event.
PASSENGERS AND
GOLD FROM ALASKA
The Alliance Arrives at Seattle With
$300,G00 and 112 Men From
Dawson City.
SEATTLE, Aug. 6.â The steamer Alli
ance arrived here to-night from St. Mich
ael with 120 passengers, 112 of whom are
from Dawson City. Of these only about
forty had gold. The amount they had be
tween them is estimated at $300,000.
Three McKinnon brothers of Victoria,
B. C, and W. G. McDonald of Welling
ton, B. C, old-timers, had about $40,000 in
nuggets. C. Blythman of London, Eng
land brought about $11,000, and A. Byers,
of Byers, Wash., had about $TOW. These
were" the largest individual amounts.
Captain Hadwick of the Alliance states
that there Is an improvement in the sit
uation at St. Michael and he thinks that
the stranded passengers will in a short
time be able to get up the river. Sev
eral river steamers that were being
towed up have arrived and in a short
time they will relieve the congestion.
The steam schooner, concerning which
there was some uneasiness, arrived at
St. Michael July 2*5 with her tow of
three river steamec,". Nothing has yet
been seen of the Moran fleet of river
steamers and the reports regarding them
are very conflicting. One report has them
all wrecked; another report has it that
four of them have reached Munivak in
safety and are waiting there for the re
mainder of the fleet to join them.
JIM CRANE JOKED
ABOUT ENDING LIFE
CONFIDED TO FRIENDS THAT
HE HAD TROUBLES.
He Fully Recovers From the Gas He
Inhaled at His Office Last
Tuuisday Jlight
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 6.
There seems to be little doubt that ex-
County Clerk James E. Crane intended
to commit suicide on Thursday night,
when he was found in his office nearly
asphyxiated by escaping gas. The pre
vious afternoon Mr. Crane was convers
ing with John Shay, the contractor, O.
A. Dennison and J. W. Dutton. Mr.
Crane remarked that things were not
goinj? as he desired and that he had so
much trouble that he thought he would
end his life. His remark was treated as
a jest.
"Not a bad idea," said Mr. Shay. "I
will help you. I will get a rope and a
grindstone and put you aboard a ferry
boat and you can easily do the rest."
"Won't you come with me and push me
off the deck?" said Crane.
"Not a bit of it," said Shay. "If a man
wants to die very badly he would be
quite satisfied with the assistance that
I said I would gl-ve him."
Eight hours later .'ames Crane was
found unconscious in his office with the
gas turned on. He is now thoroughly re
covered.
Captain Barnes' Joke.
OAKLAND, Aug. One little expres
sion used by Captain "Billy" Barnes at
the Young- Men's Kepublican houÃewarm
ing last night Is causing quite a little In
terest to-day. There was some u.inculty
in inducing the captain to speak in this
city, and when he did speak this is a part
of what he said:
"I want to say to you what I know my
friend Colonel Stone is go-ing to say to
you. because I . feel in my Heart he is
going to say it, and in that pleasant way
e<> that you will all ko away satlslled, but
1 want to say it firstâ that if nobody else
gets the Republican nomination for Gov
ernor Alameda County will be sure of it."
Will Be a Test Case.
OAKLAND, Aug. 6. â City Attorney
Dow this afternoon filed a demurrer to
the complaint of Dr. C. M. Selfrldge in
the suit wherein the doctor wishes to as
certain whether, the city is liable for the

order to make it a test case.

THE WAR TAX
Some Documents That
Do Not Need Stamps.
CEMETERY DEEDS EXEMPT
MUCH INFORMATION GIVEN BY
COMMISSIONER SCOTT.
Various Kinds of Instruments Upon
Which the Revenue Require
ments Must Not Be
Evaded.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6.â The Com
sioner of Internal Revenue has decided
that deeds to cemetery lots, which con
j vey only the right to burial therein, to
! erect monuments, etc., do not require a
! revenue stamp under the new law. He
I held also, in another case, that on
Is of conveyance the tax should be
puted upon the true value of the
lerty conveyed; that on deeds con
ng only a specific fractional Inter
in undivided property the tax
ild be computed on the actual value
tie interest conveyed; also that all
Is of conveyance where the value of
property exceeds $100 must be
stamped. The fact that the deed is a
II of gift from husband or wife does
exempt it from tax. A quitclaim
I or a deed made to correct a de
in a previous deed must be
certificate on the back or margin
, mortgage that the mortgage has
i satisfied requires a stamp as a
iflcate. Where, however, the local

i canceled, such entry does not re
e a stamp,
tters of administration, letters tes
entary or of guardianship, It is
, do not require stamps, but peti
for the appointment of adminis
trators, executors or guardians do re
quire stamps, as do bonds of adminis
trators, executors or guardians. No
stamp is required on certificate of tax
sale for unpaid taxes, nor on the cer
tificate of redemption from sale.
It is held also that every separate
consignment of goods delivered for
storage requires a receipt which must
be stamped if the consignment requires
several days in delivery. It need not,
however, have but one tax of 23 cents
on its receipt if it can be shown to
be but one consignment. If no ware
house receipts is issued the book of the
express company delivering the con
signment being signed as a receipt, the
stamp should be affixed thereto. Mere
local operators for the delivery of
packages, baggage and the like within
the same town, may give receipts
which are not required to be stamped.
Where, In consideration of an addi
tion to the regular storage charge, an
additional responsibility is assumed the
instrument is stamped as an insurance
policy at the rate of 1 rent on each
dollar of premium charged. It is also
held that where a policy of life insur
ance is assigned as collateral security
for a loan exceeding $1000 it should be
stamped as a pledge according to the
amount of the debts secured and not
according to the face of the policy.
GOT AWAY WITH
MONEY AND CIGARS
THIEVES RAID A MARKET
STREET LIQUOR HOUSE.
An Entrance Was Effected Through
the Skylight on the One-
Story Extension.
Despite the watchfulness of the min
ions of Lees, thieves broke Into the estab
lisment of Mohns & Kaltenbach at 29
Market street Friday night, and after
holding high revel in the store room at
the rear succeeded in getting away with
their booty.
The thieves gained access to the store
by climbing over the neighboring roofs
and breaking in a skylight on the one
story extension. There was a pile of
boxes under the skylight, and it was an j
easy drop from the roof to the boxes and j
the boxes to the floor. After drinking
all the liquor they could hold, the thieves
visited the front part of the store and
emptied the cash register, which con
taised about $30 in cash and $10 worth
of revenue stamps. They also loaded
themselves down with cigars and went
out the way they came.
An inspe. ion of the roof showed foot
prints leading toward a row of dilapld
ated lodging houses fronting on Steuart
Btreet, but the buildings in the vicinity
are so constructed that if a man gets on
the roof of one he could moke an entire
circuit of the block over ths roofs with
very little difficulty.
No clew to the robbers has yet been
found, although some of the "best men'
on the force, under the supervision of I
Chief Lees, are working on the case.

consummate my purpose. The yacht
will be completed by the end of Feb

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
CAVITE TO HONGKONGâ Subscriber.
City. The distance from Cavite. Philip
pine Islands, to Hongkong is 625 mlles.-
MAIL FOR DAVVSON-L. 8.. City. Mail
leaves for Dawson from Seattle on the j
15th of each month. Maj. Intended for
that point should be deposited in the post
office in time to reach Seattle not later
than the 14th of the month.
THE ST. PAULâ S., City. The hull of
the transport St. Paul that sailed from
this port some time since was painted
black.
THE SHORTEST ROUTEâ J.B. P., City.
The shortest route from San Francisco to
Manila is by the great circle route, 6237
miles.
IN CHINATOWNâ G. 8., Presidio, Cal.
It is estimated that at this time there are
about 20,000 Chinese in what is known aa
the Chinatown of San Francisco.
TRANSPORTSâ R. S. J.. City. The
United States Government pays from $600
to $1000 a day for the transports it has
chartered for the purpose of conveying'
troops to distant points. It would be
impossible to answer the question as to
the average of each vessel without an ex
amination of the records of the Navy
Department, and as to the continuance of
payment, that depends upon the contract
between the Government and the ship
owners.
THE AMERICAN FLAGâ C. B. 8..
City. The American flag has been
known as "Old Glory" not only
since the commencement of the
war but since Captain Driver called it
such when he raised it to the masthead
of his vessel several years before the
Civil War. It was not, however, popu
larly known as such until the incident of
raising- it over the dome of the State
building at Nashville, Term., as described
in this department a few days since; but
it has been known as the Star-poangled
banner ever since it was so denominated
by Francis Scott Key when he wrote his
Immortal song during the bombardment
of Fort McHenry in ISI4. There is no
country in the world in which the Ameri
can flag is not known as the "Star
spangled Banner," and there are but few
countries where Old Glory is spoken of
that it is not known that the American
flag is meant.

ANXIOUS TO TAKE
AGGRESSIVE ACTION
Admiral Sampson Would Like to Do
Some Warlike Work Along
Cuba's South Coast.
PLAYA DEL ERTE, Aug. 6.â The
auxiliary cruiser St. Louis has arrived
here from Porto Rico under orders to
assist in taking the United States
troops home from Santiago. Captain
Goodrich thinks his ship is too long to
enter the harbor and he will remain
here until the matter Is settled.
The transport Ran Juan arrived from
Santiago with troops and provisions
and proceeded to Caimanera. The Ar
mesia has left for Key West. The
fleet remains here, waiting orders from
Washington.
Admiral Sampson expresses the hope
that the peace negotiations will come
to a quick conclusion. He is anxious
to take aggressive action along the
Bouth coast without delay, or in the
event of peace being concluded to im
mediately relieve the suffering im
posed by the rigor of the blockade.

Sampson's keen appreciation of the suf
ferings of the Cubans and his endeav
ors to afford them relief have been a
marked feature.
The Potomac has recovered $10,000
from the Infanta Maria Teresa, which
was driven ashore at the time Admiral
Cervera attempted to escape from San
tiago. The transport Resolute, with
marines aboard, is still here. The shore
is deserted save for the cable opera
tions and our marines who are on
guard.
The newspapers containing Admiral
Sampson's report of the battle of July
3 arrived here last night. They were
eagerly read throughout the fleet and
the report created intense satisfaction.
The universal confidence in and devo
tion to the admiral by the men under
his command rendered this expression
of feeling a foregone conclusion.

the parlors when It was learned that Lieu
tenant Hobson was to 'be at Long Beach.
Some one started a popular subscription
for a testimonial to htm and It was unani
mously agreed that a sword would be
the proper thing. In a Short time $300
was In the hands of the treasurer.
The committee appointed to meet the
lieutenant In New lork and escort him
to Long Beach purchased the sword for
$275. It Is heavily laid with gold over
handle and blade and Interlined with em
bossed silver. It was presented to the
lieutenant after dinner before the guests
who crowded the parlors, and ball rooms,
and made the walls ring with their cheers.
Hobson received the sword and said feel
ingly:
"It Is with the profoundest emotion that
I receive and accept this beautiful token
so spontaneously offered by this generous
group. I cannot adequately express my
appreciation and thanks. I have only to
say that as long as my career shall con
tinue this emblem shall be dearly cher
ished and shall ever recall this occasion.
When perhaps I am far away and occa
sion may arise to use this sword, I can
not but feel that the thought of this oc
casion will inspire its use for my coun
try's honor.
"I have to beg of you that you recall
this simple, absolute factâ that the little
incident at the front indicates nothing but
only the status of your sailors afloat."

ONCE MORE THE TELEPHONE.
\A ANY things have been charged against the
/ \ telephone, and most of them with justice. It
* * is an irritating machine, with a voracious ap
petite for nickels, a squeaky voice, and about the
manipulation of its central mechanism there has been
Usually so notable a lack of intelligence that patrons
hive ventured to make remarks concerning it. The
telephone has given to mankind an impetus toward
a state of chronic profanity, but only recently has it
gone =o far as to drive anybody to attempt suicide.
To be sure the young woman in question was in
love, and therefore not to be held strictly ac
countable, particularly as she wanted to converse
with the man in the case. She essayed vainly to gain
his ear through the medium of the telephone. The
cold and impassive device, in no whit moved by the
ardor of her yearning, refused to aid the cause of her
courtship. The telephone merely rattled and
groaned, called for more nickels, or brought back
to her' pearly, listening ear the iterated and chest
rutty phrase, "'Line is busy; call again." This was
certainly a trial. "For goodness gracious sakes!"
exclaimed the young woman, gritting her teeth.
Agiir there was a stir in the telephone box. Life
Bevmed to throb along the wire, and with hope re
r.ev.ed she placed the trumpet to her ear. Then she
was told that the insatiate demon was in need of a
nickel; she contributed. "Call again," remarked the
machine. "Whirr, buzz-z zip."
Let us not be harsh with the girl. She was so
angry :-he just had to shoot something, and there
wasn't a liivng mortal there but herself. Across her
mind flashed a desire to kill the President, to chop
down the poles, to poison the operator at central.
Thee wonhy ambitions were impracticable. She
grabbed a pistol and shat herself. She didn't shoot
straight and will get well. But if she had died
wouldn't trie telephone company have be-en respon
sible?
McNAB FOR CONGRESS.
THE possession of political power is often said
to turn the heads of those who attempt to exer
cise it. We can place no other construction
upon the announcement that Mr. Gavin McXab in
tends to run himself for Congress in the Fourth Dis
trict than that the success which has attended his
bossship so far has affected his brain. Not but that
Mr McNab would make an excellent Congressman.
Indeed there is every reason to believe that rhe exer
cise of his peculiar talents upon the House of Repre
sentatives would confer upon California the distinc
tion of possessing a Congressman even greater than
Maguire â if such a thing is possible.
But we cannot understand why the whispering boss
should desire to descend from the proud pedestal of
Democratic dictator in San Francisco to the humili
ating position of submitting himself to the people.
What right have the people to pass upon the political
claims of Mr. McXab so long as those claims are
conceded by McXab himself? The voluntary abdi
cation of power which his candidature for Congress
will entail is the most extraordinary case of self
abnegation on record. The first Napoleon's resigna
tion of the French crown at Fontainebleau is not at
all comparable to it.
However, it will be well to encourage Mr. Mc-
Nab's ambition. There are in the Fourth Congres
sional District upward of 30,000 voters. We venture
to say that 95 per cent of them are anxious to see
MrXab's name upon the official ballot. The source
of this desire we shall not attempt to fathom.
Whether the voters of this district desire to elect
McXab by a majority which will go thundering
down the ages, or whether they are curious to see
exactly how the whispering boss would look ap
pealing to them for support, we do not know. But
as to the yearning we can speak advisedly. In fact
we will increase the percentage. We will assert con
fidently that out of the 30,000 voters in the Fourth
District at least 29,500 are frantically anxious for
HcNab to run. We think that under the circum
stances he ought to run, notwithstanding he may be
compelled to relinquish some of his prerogatives as
dictator of this city. It is seldojn that the public
is so unanimous in its desire to get a chance at a
man.
Hence we trust he will be successful in packing the
State convention delegation. It is not often that we
care to justify high-handed political methods such as
Mr. McNab now proposes in his Congressional fight,
but if ever the end justified the means in any case it
will in this on*. By all means let the Democratic
State delegation be packed in the interest of McNab.
Were proclamations issued by Spanish Governors
General as effective as the authors intended there
would be neither American army nor navy. But as
it is the proclamations ar~ of no particular use unless
they may be employed as comic valentines.
Many of the Spanish are making such a protest
over the prospects of peace that there is doubt if they
can be induced to enjoy it when it has really arrived.
YELLOW LIES.
THE war has made the most astounding revela
tions of deliberate lying and deception prac
ticed upon the American people by the yellow
press.
The military problems ensuing upon the declara
tion of war were light and easy compared with those
which come upon a declaration of peace.
The two yellow and besotted papers of Hearst, re
inforced by the New York World, told the country
that the Cubans had an organized government, with
a fiscal bureau, a system of public schools, a judicial
establishment and all the muniments of a state fit to
take its place among the powers. They demanded
belligerent rights for this Cuban government and fol
lowed this by a demand for its recognition outright
by the United States. Senators and Representatives
went to Cuban waters, in Hearst's yacht, as his paid
"commissioners," and, returning, in the Senate and
House these members of Congress tore passion to
tatters in describing what they saw. They exhausted
the vocabulary- of flattery in their ascriptions to the
Cuban government. They said that all it needed -was
arms and it would expel Spain from the island. The
San Domingo negro, Gomez, was praised as equal
to Washington in patriotism and to Napoleon in mil
itary strategy.
When the President, to whom the situation was
known, asked for the power of intervention, these
papers and their allies immediately took advantage
of his reference of the issue to Congress to insist
upon recognition of the Cuban government. They
did this in the face of the statement of Fitzhugh Lee
that there was no Cuban government nor army. Mr.
William J. Bryan appeared in Washington to back
up the yellow press, and bugled his followers into
line for recognition, declaring that it would be "good
politics."
The Senate thereupon declared for recognition, and
only by almost superhuman exertions did the Presi
dent succeed in defeating this declaration. There
was substituted for it the phrase that "the people of
Cuba are and ought to be free and independent."
Then came war. We blockaded the island, shut out
food and munitions of war from the Spanish centers,
and sent in food, arms and ammunition to Gomez,
Garcia and Maso.
We fattened and equipped the "Cuban army" and
we starved and disarmed the Spanish force. What
has been the result? Gomez had no army. The
boast that if armed by us he would expel Spain was
idle vaporing. He has shriveled into a common
San Domingo negro, whose patriotism is diverted
from great exploits at the sight of a flitch of bacon
or a fresh watermelon. When Garcia's "army" was
asked to help our men cut the barb-wire trocha at
Santiago and assist us in making roads over which
to bring artillery, the black rascals replied, "We are
soldiers, not laborers."
When our boys had cut the trocha and left their
camp to go into the hot hell of that battle where
2000 fell. Garcia's noble band stayed behind and stole
everything in our camp, including the hospital and
medical stores.
They killed only prisoners of war, or the naked
survivors of Cervera's fleet as they swam ashore, and
used the ammunition we gave them in target practice
on the corpses of Spanish officers as they floated in
the sea.
There was no Cuban army nor government, no
school system, fiscal establishment nor judiciary. The
patriots over whom these yellow journals and yel
lower Congressmen wept and agonized robbed the
men we sent there to fight for them, and stole the
medical and hospital stores, for lack of which our
boys have been dying, fever smitten, in the swamps
of Eastern Cuba.
The President was right and should have been sus
tained to the extreme of his policy. A number of
Congressmen have invited themselves out of public
life and into public contempt by their indorsement
of the lies of yellow journalism, and the Government
finds itself loaded with the most vexatious respon
sibility as the war comes to a close. There was no
Cuban government. We must lick one into shape.
If the Spanish population go into exile in fear of the
!oot which would follow our military withdrawal
from the island, the majority there *.v ill consist of
negroes and their congeners. What they can do in
the way of government in the tropical islands we see
exemplified in the opera bouffe states of Hayti and
San Domingo, where Simon Sam and General
Heureaux strut at the head of the procession, plumed
like parrots.
Yellow journalism has an account to settle with
the American people. Its Cuban patriots have cost
good lives unnecessarily. The co-operation which the
yellow press said they were capable of giving has not
been offered. Our men went into battle alone, and
they sickened alone, and have died alone, hundreds
of them, because the "patriots" of the yellow writers
stole their medical stores.
These yellow journals were in league with the Cu
ban Junta in New York, who had printed nearly a
half billion of bonds as a blanket mortgage on the
island, to be validated by the recognition which Mr.
Bryan said would be "good politics."
The members of this Junta are the murderers of
'every American who fell in battle for lack of Cuban
co-operation, and of every one who has died for
need of what Garcia's bandits stole from their camp.
It is to be hoped that our experience with this blanket
mortgage junta will be the means of denying to spec
ulative conspiracy any future lodgment in the United
States.
Dr. Arthur Marten sends from the Ukiah Asylum

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, STISDAY, AL'GUST 7, 189 S.
A MATHEMATICAL INQUIRY.
OUR esteemed Republican cousins in Southern
California, a* readers oi The Call must already
be aware, are making preparations to place
before the Republican convention which meets at
Sacramento on the 23d inst. a candidate for Gov
ernor of California. The gentleman's name is Henry
T. Gage. He is said to be a good man, weighing the
requisite number of pounds, and possessed of a po
litical record which is not likely to trouble him.
In order to promote the prospects of Mr. Gage
our esteemed Republican cousins have abandoned
all claim to the United States Senatorship now held
by their fellow citizen, Mr. White. They say (at
least those who champion the cause of Mr. Gage)
; that they will concede this place in the Senate to
1 Northern California, and it is alleged on reliable in-
I formation that they have made a combination with
General de Young, late of the Midwinter Fair, and
the Southern Pacific with this concession in view.
The programme is understood to be to send Mr.
Gage to the executive mansion and Mr. de Young to j
the Senate. The report, therefore, that the region j
south of Tehachapi intends to demand both tae
gubernatorial and Senatorial offices is probably a ;
canard, circulated by Democratic enemies of the
orange politicians for the purpose of injuring them
in the estimation of their northern Republican allies. 1
Since this arrangement is now perfected and all
hands are working energetically to produce a fay- j
orable result, we are emboldened to ask, on behalf j
of Northern California, on what ground does South- !
crn California demand the Republican gubernatorial ;
nomination this year? That region casts less than
20 per cent of the vote of the State. It cannot, there- j
fore, demand the governorship on the ground that its j
suffrages are necessary to elect the Republican ticket, j
unless it has figured out that the majorities its peo
ple cast entitle it to recognition.
We presume the entire Southern California press I
will answer in chorus that this is the. ground: South j
of Tehachapi being "solidly Republican." we
imagine them saying, the fact that it has had three
Governors in twenty years, though casting less than
one-quarter the vote, ought not now to deprive it j
of a fourth.
But is Southern California "solidly Republican?"
Let us scan the figures for a moment. The counties
comprising "south of Tehachapi" are Los Angeles,
San Diego. Santa Barbara, Ventura. Orange, River
side and San Bernardino, which poll about 40,000
votes. The following table shows by pluralities how
this region has voted at the last two elections:
â¢ Eptee, McKinley, Bryan,
1594. 1896. 1396.
Los Angeles 3.636 848
San Diego.. .... 870 â¢ â¢ 2.i
Santa Barbara 343 S8
Orange 520 230
Riverside .... 565 377
Ventura 303 &S
Where, may we be permitted to ask, were the Re
publicans of Southern California at the election of
1896? Alameda County gave 7000 plurality for Mc-
Kinley. and the Republicans of San Francisco, which
city gave Budd in 1894 12.000 plurality, carried the
election for McKinley by 400 plurality â an astonish
ing result when we consider that Bryanism exhausted
itself in this vicinity. Can the Republicans of the
south guarantee that in the event of Mr. Gage's
nomination he will carry the six counties which form
the basis of his claims? We understand that there is
a Silver Republican Club in Los Angeles which has
upon its rolls 6000 names. All these men, we are
informed, are pledged to support Maguire for Gov
ernor.
Before this business proceeds further we should
be pleased to have some of Mr. Gage's supporters
inform us as to the exact nature of the confidence
operation they contemplate perpetrating upon the
north this year. In the meantime we may as well
claim, from the face of the record, that Northern
California is entitled to name the candidate for Gov
ernor in 1898.
THE GLORIOUS IMMUNES.
i â Â» IVE regiments of "immunes" arc now on their
j way to Santiago to relieve the troops who after
* capturing that city have found in the malarial
air and the dreadful approach of yellow fever an
enemy more terrible than the Spaniard. Th: im
munes have met the dreaded pestilence, have wrestled
with it and recovered from it. They are safe from
any future attack and to them the guarding of the
captured city through the tropic summer will be
something like a picnic season of repose and relaxa
tion.
These immunes are now receiving a good deal of
glory. Since the battles are over, and peace seems
near, and since all has been said about Teddy's
Rough Riders and other notable volunteer regiments
at the front, the war correspondents of the Eastern
papers have turned their glowing pens upon the im
munes and are writing them up at a rate that is worth
a dollar a line to them if they should ever wish to
pose as models of all virtue. It seems, according to
the statements of some correspondents, that to the
making of a perfect man nothing more is necessary
than to get the yellow fever and then recover from it.
As a writer for The Call says: "Yellow fever works
wonderful changes in a man, both mental and phy
sical. Every material poison and every other disease
germ seems to be literally cooked out of the system
by the high temperature, and the patient, if he re
covers, begins life again with a new body, as it were.
The change in disposition is alike remarkable. Wh.ere
before there was a tendency to anger, depression and
discontent, there is patience and amiability, lightness
and buoyancy and contentment with life, without the
impairment of any of the better qualities of a man."
Men who have been thus purified should certainly
be something extraordinary. Five full regiments of
them banded together and camped in victory and
glory in an island of the summer sea, where oranges
and olives grow abundant and purple grapes hang
from every garden wall; where the languorous af
ternoons lull to siestas and the cool nights invite to
music and revelry; where the dark-eyed girls are
forever singing of love to the melody of guitars or
dancing with joy to the tinkling of castanetsâ there
ought to be an idyl almost elysian in its innocent
and bright perfection. We may well imagine the
happy immunes hailing their generals with cheers
and crying, "If this be war, may we never have
peace."
Furthermore, if it be proven true that yellow fever
does thus destroy every vicious defect, physical and
mental, there will be in the minds of the Californians
a trembling and eager hope. Fugitive Willie is
there, Willie the faker, Willie the yellow boy far
from home. Now if he should get a touch of the
magical fever and have all his old self burned out of
him and be cured and come home and pay his
debts, quit circulating his garbage paper through the
crematory' and pull down his siren, what a relief it
would be to a long-suffering city.
As there are plenty of white men to supply the
transports with crews the row that is being made
over the inability to get Chinese sailors is hard to
understand.

to liquidate his doctor bills or so much

There was appeal after appeal, the
clerk being sustained in several courts,
but whether the case was finally set
tled I do not know. At least it was
not settled until Sage had shown him
self to be the meanest man whose
meanness ever got on record. Now he
has the nerve to swear that he is

It has never been my fortune to meet
Robert Sanderson, capitalist, of Oak
land, but I have learned of him and
take pleasure in introducing him to
readers. It was he who caused a wo
man to be evicted for a trifle of rent,
but such things must happen, I sup
pose, and in this circumstance alone
was not the offending. The constable
who served the writ was human,
wherein he held an advantage over the
capitalist. When he saw that the wo
man had a large family, all dependent
upon her, he declined to set her into the
street, but got another house, paid the
rent for a month, and moved her into
it. Then Sanderson roared. He did
not regard an ejectment marked by an
absence of cruelty as being the sort
he had bargained for. The operation
he considered incomplete in that it did
not conclude with the woman and her
children sitting roofless under the night
sky, and so he demurred about hand
ing over the fee. I believe he did late
make a settlement, although to do s
pained him. Sanderson is the sort o
a capitalist whose mission in life is 1
make himself as well as worthy an
decent rich men hated. I hope neve
to have to mention him again, bu

that the-malovelent disposition he man

inquired the citizen, "why do you not

struck the clubber otherwise. "That,"
he responded, taking a fresh grip on
his club, "is none of your d n busi

this view, but having no desire to get

LADEN TRANSPORTS SAIL FOR HAWAII.
Tf)e Charles Nelson and LaÃr^e Left San Francisco Port Early Yesterday, Carrying Soldiers for
Honolulu. Th)e Tacoma, With Horses for Manila, Accompanied Th)em.
WITHOUT the toot of a whistle or the boom of a cannon the transports Charles Nelson and Lakme got away for Honolulu and the Tacoma for Ma
nila early yesterday morning.
Friday night the New York Volunteers went aboard the Charles Nelson and Lakme and the steamers then went Into the stream and anchored.
At 6 a. m. yesterday the Nelson was under way and an hour later was off the nine-fathom buoy.
At 9a. m. the Lakme's anchor was taken aboard and shortly afterward she also was on her way out through the Golden Gate. Given a fair wind
the transports may make the run to Honolulu in eight days, but the chances are that they will be all of ten and may be eleven before the soldier boys get
out of their close quarters.
At 10 a. m. the Tacoma was ready for a tow to sea. The tug Sea King went alongside and soon had her outside. It did not take Captain Davis
long to get all sail on his ship and the Tacoma was soon speeding after the Nelson and Lakrne.
A great number of people visited the front during the morning to see the transports off. One and all were disappointed, as the transports were
out of sight of land before the sightseers reached the water front.

bugles, and in reality only two of these
are regimental property.

STILL THE FARMERS
CONTROL THE MARKET
FOB A TIME WHEAT PRICES
DEPEND ON THEM.
But No Unreasonably High Rates for
the Cereal May Be Looked for
This Yearâ Crop Estimate.
August 6, 1898.
The past week has caused a radical
change in wheat speculation. Prices show
an appreciation of 5 cents over those of
the week previous. The cause for the ad
vance may chiefly bo attributed to the
stronger English market and email re
ceipts at home grain centers. There has
been strong buying of spot wheat from
all quarters, foreigners leading. The ex
ceedingly low stocks at home and abroad
helped to frighten shorts who had sold
to their limits. The buying from thi*
quarter made the market very spirited
at the advance. Farmers were disposed
to sell their wheat more liberally. Ex
porters reported cash offerings increasing
materially, but the price for spot was by
no means soft.
The crop is now estimated by good con
servative experts at 700,000,000 bushels.
England and France report their crop
progressing favorably. Reports from
Russia are not as as.suring as they might
be yet there is no reason to anticipate
otherwise than a fair crop. There would
at this time, appear to be enough wheat
to go around. Much depends upon the
action of farmers. If they begin to sell
their wheat the supply will, of necessity,
meet tht; demand. The action of the
market during the past week was more
of a congested state â an oversold condi
tion. Those who had sold September
thought it prudent to change from that
option to December when spring wheat
will be on the market.
It is a noticeable fact spring wheat pro
ducers are more disposed to sell their
wheat an soon as harvested than farmers
in the winter wheat section. Harvesting
in the Dakotas and Minnesota will be well
under way by Wednesday of this week,
when deliveries will show a material In
crease. These conditions may produce a
freer movement In winter wheat; If so
present prices will not hold. A depress
ing effect will exert itself and a lower
range of prices prevail. If, on the other
hand, producers refuse to part with their
wheat temporarily prices may go higher,
but the fact remains America will have a
large surplus this crop year which must
sooner or later find an outlet. Prices
will have to be shaped to suit conditions.
At present prices producers are rewarded
by a fair profit for their efforts.
The situation does not warrant any
sensational markets such as prevailed
previous to June. Any furtner advance
will not be lasting. When millers' stocks
are filled up, which will not take long,
their offerings will have to find accept
ance through storage sources. This de
mand Is never as urgent as that of mill
ers. Those who anticipate unreason
able high prices for wheat this year
will meet with disappointment. An ad
vance resulting from buying by shortÃ Is
not generally of a lasting character. The
market will from time to time become
oversold and a good rally result, but as
soon as the market becomes evened up
the reaction will be as rapid as the ad
vance. September wheat in the Chicago
market sold at eSTfcc, December 6t>%c,
Saturdayâ an advance of s*4c for the for
mer and 3c for the latter from the low
point.
Wheat In the local market was active
and higher, demand coming almost en
tirely from shorts. The heavy premium
for December wheat is starting consider
able wheat from Washington and Oregon,
which will probably increase rapidly after
harvesting begins. Shippers are almost
entirely out of the market. One point
which holders of wheat should not over
look is the probable cheapness of tonnage
from the north later on. Unless some
thing unforeseen happens local prices
cannot hold.
Barley has exerted every effort to ad
vance, but with little or no effect. Lower
prices must result. r _ e _ mulcahy<

'TWAS ONLY
A
DREAM.
w "as he recounted
Â»Oi3Â«Â»Â»i30Â«Â» the experiences of
a night at the Palace. "When I engaged
my room I stipulated with the clerk that
the principal condition -of the contract
waa that he should furnish a room where
the noises of the hotel and ; street were
farthest removed. I retired. Heaven
blessed sleep soon wrapped me In forget
fulness profound and then I began to
dream. Ah, what a dream that was! I
was back at Monte Carlo with the dear
general, my only true friend and bene
factor; the red and the black and the
spinning wheel and the clink of the chips,
all combined to make me think of heaven.
I was winning. Luck was with me and
I could not ? lose. With the blood of the
reckless gambler ', which flows through
my veins I doubled and doubled and yet
I won.
" - And then I woke up. â¢ But what did I
hear?â the actual clinking: of chips and
the low eweet rumbling of the wheel. I
swear to you I thought I was at the
boards once more. The sounds did not
cease but continued during my waking.
It was so realistic that fear took pos-
MMtoB of me. I knew I was awake, but
the horrors of an hallucination held me
fast. Clink, clink and rumble, rumble.
It went on Just the same. The strain on
my mind proved Insufferable, and in an
agony of fear I dressed myself hurriedly
and called upon the night clerk. I was
panting when I explained things to him.
He is a big and wise man, and I thought
he would know if there were any spooks
around the hotel. And then he told me
that my apartments were alongside the
card room of the Union League Club,
where the clinking gets Its birth, and that
the rumbling came from the elevator on
the other side. Ah, but It was such a
happy dream." The guest sighed and

WATCH AND MONEY TAKEN
THOMAS O'BRIEN, AGED 65
YEARS, THE VICTIM.
Choked and Beaten by Two Men Who
Had Followed Him to His
Home.
Thomas O'Brien, an old man, was at
tacked by two men at Third and Berry
streets late Friday night and after be
ing beaten into insensibility was
robbed of $20 and a silver watch.
According to O'Brien's story he
visited Corbett's pool-room on Ellis
street to cash a ticket on the Tracey-
McConnell fight. His ticket called for
$20 and after receiving the money he
started for his home.
While he was in the pool-room he
noticed two men, who seemed to be
watching him. As he left the place they
followed him, but not thinking that
they intended to hold him up he paid no
attention to them. He walked along
Fourth street and when near King the
men passed him and entered a door
way. Still unmindful of his danger
O'Brien continued on his way, and as
he passed the robbers one of them
threw his arm around his throat and
threatened to strangle him if he made

an outcry. His accomplice struck him
a blow in the mouth, knocking out three
of his front teeth. The robber who held
him by the throat also struck him ren
dering him unconscious. They then
searched his pockets, taking his money
and jewelry.
A short time afterward a policeman
happened to be walking along the
street and discovered O'Brien lying on
the sidewalk. As he seemed to be ser
iously injured he had him removed to
the Receiving Hospital. After recov
ering consciousness O'Brien told the
story of the robbery, and also gave a
description of the assailants. He de
scribed the man who first attacked him
as being about thirty years of age, had
a reddish mustache and was dressed
in a dark suit of clothes. His compan
ion wore a dark slouch hat which was
pulled down over his ey<?s, concealing
his face. Immediately after the rob
bery was reported to Chief Lees he de
tailed two of his best men on the case.
Up to a late hour last night, however,
they had not succeeded in locating the
desperate men.
RAILROAD REPORTS.
Two Accounts Filed With the Rail
road Commision.
The various railroad corporations are
beginning to file their annual reports with
the Railroad Commission. Up to date the
Gualala River Railway, operating a line
from Bowens Landing to the company's
logging camp, and the Towle Brothers
Company, which operates a line thirty
seven miles long, are the only corpora
tions which have filed reports.
The Valley Railroad report is prepared
and ready for filing and the Southern Pa
cific Company is hard at work on its
report and expects to file it In a few
weeks. According to a rule of the com
mission all reports must be filed before
the Ist of September.
The Gualala River Railway's re
port Is very brief, showing no results of
the operation. The Towles line, which
begins at Towles, runs nine miles beyond
the company's Deer Creek mill. Exten
sions have been made during the year
which, with former expenses for con
struction, show an outlay of $58,738 74.
The operating expense of the road Is
$4SST 99; the freight revenue $178 S9, show
ing a deficit of $4678 10.
Smuggled Opium Seized.
Customs Searcher J. W. Campbell yes
terday discovered fifty flve-tael cans of
smuggled opium on the Doric in the bag
gage of a passenger. The opium was
confiscated. It is valued at $400.

FAREWELL DRILL OF THE SEVENTH.
Volunteer Soldiers From Southern California Entertain a Great
Throng at Mechanics' Pavilion.
Through the efforts of the members of Golden Gate Commandery. Knights Templar, the regimental fund of the
Seventh California. United States Volunteers, was greatly augmented last night. The affair assumed the form of
a drill at Mechanics' Pavilion.
The men of tho regiment went through the variouÃ evolutions as one man, their splendid drilllner showing to
advantage in the evolutions of the entire regiment under command of Colo.iel John R. Berfy. After the men were
formed for this number Mrs. Annis Montague-Turner sang "The Star-Spangled Banner," the audience standing. She
w^.: presented with a beautiful stand of carnations by the California boys.
Miijor General Merriam, commanding- the Department of California, was the reviewing officer. This duty was
performed in the early part of the evening with all impressiveness possible. Heretofore it has been placed last on
the programme and lias been witnessed by a mere hanuful of spectators. The error was made of saving too long
a programme. There is, necessarily, a sameness :o the evolutions that makes them pall on the spectators at the
end of two hours.
During the evening Captain H. D. Alfonso, adjutant of the regiment, read a telegram from the members of LO3
Angeles Commandery to those of Golden Gate Commanacry manking them for their work In behalf of the boys
from Southern California. The entertainment was under the direction of J. C. Campbell, generaasslmo; C. L.
Field, past commander; j. L. Feel and Dr. J. M. Gaasaway, assisted by members of the commandery. All were in
UOU On l Â°thV reviewing stand with General Merriam were: Brigadier General Miller. Brigadier General King, Ad
jutant General A. W. Barrett, Colonel Fred Burgin and others of Governor Budd's staff, besides officers from vari
ous regiments now stationed here. The ladles of the Red Cross entertained the boys at dinner in Machinery Hall.
Among those who labored for the comfort of the regiment were:
Mrs. W. B. Harrington. Mrs. John F. Merrill, Mrs. I. Lowenberg, Mrs.W. H. Mills, Mrs. Chauncey Winslow,
Mrs McEwen, Mrs. Robert Mackenzie, Mrs. Judge Slack, Mrs. Wilshire, Miss Bowman. Mrs. Breyfogie, Mrs. H.

WHY THE CASE
WAS DISMISSED
JUDGE MOGAN PAYS RESPECTS
TO SERGEANT HARPER.
He Gives His Reasons for Not Con
victing Ike Willis of Using
Vulgar Language.
Judg-e Mogan did not at all relish the
criticism upon his dismissal Friday of the
charge of vulgar language against Ike
Willis, janitor and messenger for the Jus
tices' courts. In speaking of the case
yesterday the Judge said:
"The case against Ike Willis, charged
â with using vulgar language, was tried
before me yesterday. The testimony of
the officers was that Willis used an oath
In the presence of a woman known as
Mabel Pinp, alias Mabel Van Pool, alias
Mabel Allen, a woman of the town who
has been arrested on numerous occasions
for vagrancy and street walking. I asked
the officer what character of woman the
prosecuting witness was, and he replied
.that she was an inmate of a house of ill
fame.
"Willis. In his defense, proved that he is
the messenger and acting bailiff of the
Justices' Court and a peace officer, and
that while speaking to the woman on the
street she Informed him that she had an
engagement with Sergeant Harper, and
In reply thereto he remarked: 'Oh, to
h with Harper. 1 Harper overheard tr.e
remark and ordered the arrest of illis.
"Owing to the fact that language pos
sibly vulgar could not offend a woman
of such character, and the further fact
that the woman did not appear to prose
cute and thai Sergeant Harper displayed
come feeling in the case, I dismissed the
game. It seems to me that when Sergeant
Harper saw this woman "street walking,
and knew the life she led, that it was
his duty to arrest her aa a vagrant, and
I so tnld him.
"Outside the courtroom Sergeant Har
per instructed Officer Collins not to arrest
the woman under any circumstances.
What his reasons are for the said in
structions, it is possible to venture a
STUCSS
"The statement that othor witnesses
were present and that I refused to hear
their testimony is untrue.
"I have Informs* ion from a former
Prosecuting Attorney of the Police Court
that Sergeant Harper's testimony can
not always be believed. I think that if
the public knew a little more of the in
side history of Mr. Harper very little at
tention would be paid to his statements."
HAWAIIAN TONNAGE TAX.
Attorney General Grigg-s Decides
That United States Laws Are
Not Yet Operative in the
Islands.
Tn response to a question whether the
Hawaiian tonnage tax should be collected
from vessels criming from Hawaiian ports
to the United States, Attorney General
Griggs has rendered an opinion, from
which the following Is an extract:
â¢"If we should hold the previous rela
tion of the two countries altered as sug
gested we should vainly look throuph the
resolution for any adequate provision for
enforcing such laws as are supposed to
apply to the islands. No arrangement is
made for collecting- our tonnage tax upon
vessels, of other countries entering Ha
waiian ports, nor Is any other tax law
or other law of the United States, unless
It bo the law prohibiting Chinese immi
gration, expressly or implledly furnished
with Instrumentalities for its execution.
It seems to me that. In view of this gen
eral plan and of the express declaration
that the existing customs relations, else
where spoken of as 'the present commer
cial relation?, ' of the Hawaiian Islands
with the United States and other coun
tries are to remain unchanged, it Is Dot
going too far to say that Congress haw
affirmatively Indicated its intent that
such laws aa our tonnage tax laws are to
remain undisturbed by the annexation of
the islands until 'Congress shall provide
a government for such islands,' or until
a commission shall advise and Congress
enant 'such legislation concerning the
Hawaiian Islands as they deem necessary
or proper.'
â¢â Vessels from Hawaiian ports, there
fore, having been from foreign ports
within the meaning of the tonnage tax
law. have not ceased, in my opinion, to be
vessels from foreign ports within the
meaning of that law."
STAMPED PAPERS.
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch re
ceived yesterday from the office of the
Commissioner cf Internal Revenue the
! following opinion, which will prove of
' vital interest to bankers, brokers and bus
! mess men generally.
Tour letter of the 14th Inst. has been re
1 celved, submitting for examination by this
: office, the opinion rendered to you by your
counsel, Mr. John P. Wilson, as to the re
quirement! of schedule A t>f the act of June
I 13, IS9S, relating to the various instruments
1 and documents used In the transactions of your
I board. :â¢ ;. -
He has correctly advised you that â¢ the pro
j visions of the statute requiring a stamp upon
; promissory notes and also upon mortgages and
; trust deedx securing the same, are distinct and
separate and that stamps are required on both
; the note and mortgage. But his opinion that
' a release deed, reconveylng property conveyed
! by mortgage or trust deads to secure the pay
i ment of money given after the payment of the
: debt secured thereby, does not require a stamp
: In accordance with the ruling of this office.
It has en held that where, In the satisfaction
of the mortgage, a rejular release is executed,
i the release cornea under the head of a "con
i veyance," and that-the stamp tax is required
'â  to be paid. thereon according to the value of
, the Interests released, or conveyed by such in
: "trum^nt. Where, however, the local laws
authorize entry of satisfaction, and the mort
gage Is thus canceled, such entry does not re
quire a stamp, as it Is regarded neither as a
'â¢ lease nor as a certificate.
He Is inclined to the opinion that coupon
I or interest notes in no case require to be
stamped; but It is held by this office that
| when a note or bond Is given for the pay

ment of money, and separate notes or bonds
arÂ» given for accruing Interest, nut only Is the
note or bond for the principal sum required to
be stamped, but the separate bonds or notes
given for the interest must also be stamped.
In the case, however, of a bond for a princi
pal sum with coupons attached denoting the
accruing interest, the purpose being to detach
the coupons, as the interest becomes due, and
surrender them simply to denote the payment
of that interest, It Is held that the only stamp
required is the stamp upon the bond for the
principal sum, and that the Interest coupons
attached do not require separate stamps.
He has correctly advised you that orders for
the payment of money at sight or on demand
are subject to the stamp tax Imposed on checks
by the third paragraph of schedule A; but
that an order for the payment of money
"otherwise than at sight or on demand," the
stamp tax must be paid aa on promissory
notes under the fourth paragraph ct the sched
ule. His further statement that orders for
money from the owners or architects require
to be stamped In accordance with the ruling
of thin offlea under the law â his statement
made to you of the stamp taxes required to be
paid on the various Instruments which he men
tions, viz, real estate sale contract, deed of
conveyance of realty, lease, mortgage or trust
deed, promissory note and transfer of mort
gage â Is in accordance with the provision of
the law.
He Is also correct In stating that an archi
tect certificate requires no stamp, unless by
an Indorsement It becomes an order for the
payment, and that an affidavit does not require
a stamp, nor does a waiver of Hen. with
reference to an acknowledgment of a deed
before a notary it is held that the certificate
of acknowledgment does not require a separate
stamp, but that it is covered by the stamp
under the completed deed or conveyance.
â Where leases are nxecuted in duplicate, so that
both are originals, both are required to be
stamped; but if there be but one original,
copies thereof are not required to be stamped.
A memorandum of sale under the head of
"contract" in schedule A means only a con
tract, and it is this memorandum which re
quires the 10-cent stamp. A statement of ac
count showing the receipts and disbursements
In connection with the sale and not being a
contract of sale does not require a stamp. A
broker's memorandum of sale, of promissory
notes ("notes of hand") requires the 10-cent
stamp. It is hold that a person not a broker
within the meaning of the second paragraph
of section 2 of the act of June 13, 189 S. by
rpnFnn of engaging in a business of buying,
selling or leasing real estate or because of
negotiating loans on real estate as an agent
where there Is no sale of the securities, but
that if he makes loans for himself or others
and afterward sells the security this brings
him within the definition of a broker In the
net an<l he Is required to pay special tax ac
cordingly.
HER LIFE GIVEN TO GOOD.
MOTHER SUPERIOR MARY BAPTISTE RUSSELL,
Who Breathed Her Last in This Cltu Yesterday.
NO death in recent years will be heard of with greater regret in
this community than that of Mother Superior Mary Baptiste
Rupsell, the sweet woman who watched over the destinies of
various charitable institutions in this city during the past half
century.
The tidings of her calm leave-taking of th!s life will be heard
with regret by the thousands who were fortunate enough to meet her
and by thope who have heard or read of her beautiful deeds of char
ity since her advent in this State. A more lovable character than
that which she possessed has been rarely found. Her constant aim in
life had been to uplift the suffering and the wounded, and in this she
was entirely successful.
During the past month Mother Russell was affected with a clog
ging of the arteries of the brain, anct* despite the efforts of her phy
sicians, Drs. Leonard. Lame and McMonagle, she rapidly sank, and
at 7 tÂ»clock yesterday morning pecicefully passed away.
The sisterhood that had loved and revered the mother were told of
her condition, and all through Friday night the entire community
surrounded her bed and watched and prayed.
At the time of her death Mother Russell was in her seventieth
year. As a young girl she gave up a life of luxury and ease to take
up the noble work that she carried through with great ability. Ar
riving in this State in 1554 as the Superior of the Order of Our Lady
of Mercy, she immediately rt-eognized the need of a guiding hand.
With the aid of the six sisters that accompanied her to the then rough
field she bepran to map out a course which she followed with credit to
herself and to the good of the community.
Mother Russell's first work of note was In the City and County
Hospital, which was then situated on Stockton and Vallejo streets.
Owing to the newness of the community disease thrived . Cholera
spread among the inhabitants with great rapidity and soon unfortu
nates fell viefims to the deadly scourge. Mother Russell and her six
missionaries fearlessly went among the overcrowded hospital, minis
tering to the wants of the patients, and receiving in turn their bless
ings. A similar experience in Ireland had taught them the best
methods to handle the plagrue, and through their united assistance
the disease "was soon wiped out.
At that time the city's population was made up considerably of
children who had been left her* v.hile their parents spent the sea
son at the mines. The Sisters found themselves with a large num
ber of children, who needed the benefit of schooling, and this led to
the establishment of a day school which has since resulted in many
parishes sustaining similar im tituticns-.
When the City and County Hospital was transferred the Sisters
raised money by public subscription and built St. Mary's Hospital,
which has grown until to-day it stands as a monument to the noble
Mother Superior who watched its progress during 1 a few score years.
Since then she has been Instrumental in establishing the Old
Ladies' Home, St. Anthony's School in East Oakland, Grass Valley i
Convent, St. Brendan's Parochial School, St. Peter's School, Sacra
mento Convent and the convent at Rio Vista. i
Mother Russell came of a distinguished family. She was born
in County Down, Ireland, and was a sister of Sir Charles Russell, i
Lord Chief Justice of England. Another brother, Father Russell, is '
editor of the Irish Monthly. i
Her body is now lying in the chapel at St. Mary's Hospital, '
where it will remain until Tuesday at 10 o'clock, where a solemn i
requiem high mass will be celebrated for the repose of her soul. i

VETOED BY THE MAYOR.
The Resrlution Awarding the Stre^
Lighting Contract Does Not
Meet His Approval.
The resolution passed by the Supervis
ors awarding the street lighting contract
to the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company has been vetoed by Mayor Phe
lan. The reasons assigned by the Mayor
for vetoing the resolution are contained
In the following communication, forward
ed by him yesterday to the clerk of the
Board of Supervisors:
August 5, 1898.
Gentlemenâ l herewith return to you without
my approval resolution No. 1441 (fourth series)
awarding a contract to the San Franctscp Gas
and Electric Company for lighting the streets
of the city and county for a period of two
years from August 1, 1898. The reaeon for my
objection Is as follows:
The Mutual Electric Light Company on the
10th day of April last requested the Board of
Supervisors to grant them the same privilege
enjoyed, by the San Francisco Gas and Klec
tric Company in order that they might be In
a position to bid on the electric lighting of the
city. The privilege asked was to erect poles
outside of the flre limits, in all respects the
same as those maintained by the ether com
peting company. In consideration of this the
Mutual Electric Light Company guaranteed,
with I). O. Mills, P. B. Cornwall and Alvlnza
Hayward as guarantors, that their bid would
be $40,000 per year less than the cost of elec
tric lighting under the present contract, and
they further Â»tated that the saving to private
consumers would amount annually to $100,000.
The city's bill for electric street lighting was
$120,000 last year, and this guaranteed reduction
was therefore 33 1-3 pÂ»r cent. The board, how
ever, rejected the proposition. By their action
the board thus excluded the only possible com
petitor for the new contract. As a result there
was but one bidder, whose bid of 50 cents per
night per electric lamp, or $160 50 per year, is
a reduction of but 8 1-3 per cent under the old
contract. Furthermore, we know this price to
[ be excessive without going further to inquire
I than thÂ« guaranteed bid of the rival company.
The magnitude of this contract may he ap-
I predated by recalling that last year the city
| spent $120,000 for electric lighting and $180,000
! for gas lighting of the public streets, and that
new specifications and contract admit of an
expenditure of $160,000 for electric and $1G9,488
for gas lighting, a total of $329,988 per an
num.
By the refusal of the board to grant to the
Mutual Electric Light Company the same priv
! liege enjoyed by their competitor the city will
'â  have plainly lost in two years $60,000 if this
I proposed contract stands.
; The Mutual Electric Ltght Company, how
! ever, has not accepted the action of the board
! as final, because It forthwith sued out a writ
! of mandamus to compel the board to grant It
the privilege asked. On June 17 last the case
was argued before Judge Seawell of the Su
perior Court and now awaits his decision.
Should the court decide that the board had no
i right to refuse the prlvll^gf asked by the Mu
j tual Electric Light Company and this contract
j be awarded now to the Pan Francisco Oas nnd
Electric Company the relief sought by the com-
I peting company would be futile, and the city
at the same time be deprived of the opportu
nity of making a more advantageous contract.
I do not think these very Important con-
I siderations should be Ignored by the board,
I and that before awarding this contract it
j should await the decision of the Superior Court.
I Respectfully submitted,
JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.

I nearly proved his undoing. While in her
| company at an Informal little after-tne
theater repast he became Involved in a
i personal encounter with Captain J. C.
Elaine, United States Volunteers, which
It was thought nothing but recourse to the
duello would settle.
Mutual friends intervened and serious
results were averted, Hollander emerging
from the controversy with colors flying.
Hollander was a remittance man.
The $20 gold pieces which he commenced
to roll down Market street bo soon after
his arrival here came In such bunches as
his father thought It expedient to forward
him. When the stories of his escapades
reached the East his allowance was
stopped. As his credit was gpod, this had
DO appreciable effect for some days. At
the pace to which he had been accus
tomed to travel bills grew rapidly.
He soon owed the Palace Hotel $500, and
other creditors In proportion. A? money
was not forthcoming, the hotel manage
ment levied upon his persona] belongings.
In this predicament he bethought himself
of the army. He signified his intention
of enlisting In the First New York, and
made all the necessary arrangements up
to <he point of taking the oath of allegi
ance.
It was at this point, supposedly through
the intervention of friends in this city,
that his family came to his rescue. lie
j-iaid his hotel bill and went about set
tling the debts which he had contracted
bo freely In his hours spent In pursuit of
the fleeting pleasures of the tenderloin.
He was no long<?r a sybarite. The
pleasures of the table ana of tho wine
cup wore not for him. The sparkling, ef
fervescent wine pressed In the vineyards
of Southern France had no charm as In
the past. He had, in fact, reached the
bursting point at the end of a long blow
out, and had suddenly awakened to a
realization of the position In which he
had placed both himself and his family.
He refused all Invitations to drink.
Before his good Intentions could be
Bh&ken, and possibly fearing a lapse from
the straight and narrow path or probity
which he was treading, he turned his
face to the eastward. Thus Is closed an
Incident in the history of the town that
for a time promised to furnish more than
its share of the sensational.
of the city and also to IndueÂ© the Ameri
can people to patronize the worthy and
industrious women of their own race in
stead of taking and wearing clothing
made in the dens of Chinatown.
The scheme of the operation of such a
company was suggested to a number of
ladies and the organization of the com
pany was the result. Allen, who at Its
formation was made its manager, be
came an enthusiast in the ratue. He,
; after a few days, elaborated, as he
thought, on the original scheme. He sug
gested to the Labor Commissioner that
the women who were employed at the
factory should receive 70 per cent of the
proceeds of their labors, and that the re
maining 30 per cent should be divided
among the few who directed its opera
tions, after paying the manager his sal
ary. Fitzgerald declined to have any
thing to do with any company that would j
operate for the cause of deserving labor I
on a charitable basis.
To raise funds to equip the factory it
was agreed that stock should be issued
and sold. It was understood that no
dividends should ever be declared on the
stock, but that its sale was equivalent to
a charitable donation to the company.
The holders of the stock, however, would
be entitled to a voice In the management
of the factory. Allen, the manager, be
came an enthusiast in the disposal of the
stock. For several days he was kept
busy disposing of it to the charitably dis
posed, when word of his proposition to
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald came to
the ears of the ladies of the board of man
agers. No timo was thon lost in asking
Allen for a statement of the flnanacea
of the company. That Allen neglected to
give.
A few days after the company was or
ganized the board of managers, energetic
in their work, decided to have the fac
tory in working order with as little de
lay as possible, and they rented a suit
! able building at Eighth and Folsom
I streets and began putting in the neces
sary sewing machines as goon as they
were In possession. A sewing machine
company gave the ladies all the credit
>on the machines they desired. Allen, as
i manager, objected to ao much haste, de
claring that the ladles should devote
their time in disposing of the stock and
an umulatlng a large fund, which he, as
â  manager, would have the privilege of
' handling. There was friction with the
manager over that, and Allen was asked
for all the books and other records of thÂ«
< company in his possession. Allen
1 claimed that the board of managers had
no right to interfere in his methods of
conducting the business, and for a few
days it looked as if the company would
1 have a hard time in adjusting its affairs.
Finally Allen was prevailed upon to com
ply with the request of the ladles of the
managing board, and he promised to hand
over the books and other records he held,
I along with his resignation from an un
salaried position, by 1 o'clock yesterday,
; when the board of managers would meet.
t He did not keep his promise, and at the
meeting the position was declared va
cant.
Without Allen's interference the work
of putting the factory In shape for opera
tion went along at a rapid rate. A Grand
Army veteran named C. E. Blackburn
! was put In as overseer by Allen at the
i factory, but at the first sign of a storm
between the manager and the directorate
Blackburn sided with the ladies, declar
| Ing that they were right. He is carrying
I on the work faithfully, devoting all his
! time to It and remaining in the building
] at night, taking upon himself the duties
| of a watchman as well as his other la
i bors and asking no question* if he will
| ever get any remuneration for his work
i or not.
With Allen gone from the management
and the factory operated on the lines
that the women" employed there shall re
ceive the full benefit that is derived from
their labor, the company has the full in
dorsement of the Labor Commissioner
and the Mayor. The factory will, in addi
tion to the work that will be done with
in its walls, serve aÂ« a depot for sewing
work or any kind of work that women
can do. A record of all the women de
serving of labor and who can faithfully
perform the work assigned to them will
be kept and It to hoped that much sew
ing can be secured that women can take
to their homes and perform, handling It
all through the agency of the factory and
receiving full and reasonable remunera
tion for what, they have done.
Twenty-eight machines are now set in
place and if the work can be secured to
keep more in operation they will be sup
plled Tables have been arranged for
the operation of fifty-two machines. An
electric motor has been put in place to
give power to run the machines and it ia
( xpected to have them In operation on
Monday next. Mayor Phelan will be
asked to Btart the machinery in motion.
It is hoped to secure much if not all the
work of manufacturing the clothing for
the soldiers that is now being made in
sweatshops or in the dens of the Chinese,
where the contractors are making all the
profit and paying those who perform tho
labor starvation wages.
He Located the Claims.
The Klondike Gold Exploration Syndi
cate has sued one of its employes, D. B.
i Davidson, for an accounting. The plain
; i^T alleges that it employed the defend
:*t to locate mining properties for Its
I benefit in the Klondike. Davidson pro
ceeded to Alaska, located many claims,
I sold them out and kept the money. The
i plaintiff alleges that such acts were il
legal and he should be forced to turn
over all moneys realized to the syndicate.

HEWSON'S STEAM TURBINE
A NEW METHOD OF MARINE
PROPULSION.
Expert Engineers From the Navy-
Department Have Been Ordered
to Come to This
City.
The Secretary of the Navy has for the
past three months been in correspondence
with Robert Hewson of San Francisco,
inventor of a steam turbine that recently
startled the mechanical and engineering
world and just now promises to revolu-
tionlze steam power as used in propelling
the fighting ships of the United States
navy. It is the purpose of Secretary Long
to have this turbine inspected and report
ed upon by experts, who will shortly
come here from Washington. The object
of the Inspection is to ascertain if the
Hewson multiple-expansion steam tur
bine may be practically applied in the
stead of triple-expansion steu.rn engines
used In the big battle-ships.
The Navy Department is quite aware of
the simplicity and economy of the inven
tion, and the only present question to be
decided is the practicability of It. If Mr.
Hewson's machine shall stand the test of
expert inspection, then the Government
will place at his disposal for a practical
test a totpedo-boat, so that the world may
shortly know whether or not an Ameri
can inventor has solved tht> problem of
economical propulsion of great ships.
The turbine which Mr. Hewson has just
completed as a working model to be sub
mitted to the naval engineer experts is
beyond doubt the most wonderful and
startling Invention that the engineering
world has known. It iB wonderful from
the mere simplicity of It and startling be
cause of the immense power, great en
durance and freedom from danger of ex
plosion. It is so simple of construction
that a boy, without previous knowledge
of engineering and with but a few days'
or hours' instruction, could drive it with
perfect safety.
It is the first multiple-expansion steam
turbine ever invented and constructed.
Mr. Hewson has been at work for some
fourteen years in the effort to attain mul
tiple-expansion, arid from his former in
vention other inventors have produced
triple-expansion turbines, but of vastly
different mechanism from this, which is
to be examined by the Navy Department. ;
It was from a small model constructed |
by Mr. Hewson that Mr. Parsons, an <
English inventor, who visited San Fran
1 Cisco some twelve years ago, obtained his
! ideas for the steam turbine that he ap
! plied to the Turblnla, a vessel that for
I several months has been navigated in ;
i British waters. It was from drawings
and models of Mr. Hewson's later inven- ,
tlons that another foreign inventor se- |
cured his principles of steam turbines.
But the present Invention was so closely
guarded that no one, except the builders,
ever got the faintest notion of its con
struction until the security of the Patent
Office had been placed around It.
The machine is cast in only four parts
two steam chambers, one disk and one
shaft The two steam chambers are riv

bers The steam, which may be gener
ated at any point near by or distant, is
conveyed to tlie chambers of the turbine
by means of a pipe at the rear side. ;
Within the interior face of these steam .
chambers are four circular rows of small
Dockets Into which the steam from the

the steam in the upper row of pockets is I
driven into a corresponding row of U
shaped buckets cast in the disk
The steam then escapes from the buck
et in the disk to a receiving pocket in the
steam chamber, and is then forced to the
second row of pockets and buckets, and
this is repeated until the four rows of j
Dockets and buckets have been acted j

The advantages of Mr. Hewson's inven
tion over the triple steam engine now in
use in marine engineering are easily seen.
The turbine exhibited to a Call reporter
by Mr. Hewson is of 500 horsepower. It
occupies a ground space of two and a half
feet by si* feet, and stands about three
feet from the ground to the top of the
turbine. The turbine itself is about 30 >
inches In exterior diameter by 16 inches !
thickness the interior disk being 28 inches
in diameter. The ground space occupied
by a triple engine would be about 10 feet
by 20 feet The Hewson turbine requires
no concrete foundation. There is no jar,
no wear and tear, for the steam chambers
' rp effected by no reaction. The cost of
construction of the turbine is about $2
ncr horsepower, while the cost of steam
engine construction is about $40 per
h( The P advantage of the turbines for use
in bIK battleships is found in the fact
thit they would occupy about half the
sDace and are less than half the weight
nf the triple steam engines, thus affording
ereater area and carrying capacity for
coal- and that the cost of construction '
is mi Kreatly reduced. Besides these the
perfect safety and utmost simplicity of
the turbines, being shorn of all exterior
complications, are items of economical
advantage that will be taken into account
by the Navy Department.
Mr Hewson is a man of youthful ap
pearance for one who has been on this
mast for thirty-five years. He began hia :
California career as a miner.

tion in legal circles.
Papers preparatory to the opening or
an action are being drawn up by the OaK
land law firm of Gibson & Woolner which,
with Attorney H. B. Griffin of Modesto,
will represent the little girl and her guar
dian, John F. Bluett, in court.
Coroner Baldwin in Oakland has been
notified that the action will be com
menced, and has been requested by tne
attorneys to produce the depositions tak
en at the time of Bluett's death and other
records of the Coroner's jury which sat
in his case. The sum to be sued for will
not be made known until the papers in
the case are filed. The contest will be re
garded as extremely important, both on
account of the intricate points at law
to be brought out in the effort to locate
the responsibility for Bluett's death and
because of the large sum of money to be
involved. The case will unquestionably
pass to the records as an isolated one.
William Bluett was a "student brake
man in the employ of the Southern Pa
cific Company. He had been detailed, as
his relatives now claim, to join the crew
of a freight train running to Livermore,
and had been placed in a position where
he might readily be instructed.
He left Livermore on the freight train
one afternoon in good spirits and hard a I
work. Next morning a tramp found his
lifeless body beside the track at Decoto.
H> reported his find and foul play was
suspected, but the tramp was released,
and later a Coroner's juiv found tnat Blu
ett had been caught by a sagging tele
phone wire as he walked along the top 01
the freight cars and had been thrown to
his death. The wire found by the jury
hung just above the cars and gave evi
dence of having been severely strained.
After Bluett had been buried the rela
tives instituted an investigation on their
own account, and the present suit for dam
ages, about to be opened. Is the result. A
large sum, it is understood, will be sued
for
The Southern Pacific Company, the
lawyers allege, will be held accountable
for permitting a train to pass beneath
sagging wires when their employes were
compelled to walk upon the car tops.
The Bell Telephone Company will be
made to answer for having placed the
wire in such a careless manner as to per
mit of Its falling, and the Western Union
Telegraph Company will have to stand
suit, the attorneys declare, because of its
willingness to have its poles used for such
a purpose. The Crane family had ordered
the wire put up, it is claimed, and they
will be asked to contribute, therefore, to
the reparation.
Bluett's daughter, who is to sue, is the
eldest of three children. Although a com
paratively young mnn. Bluett nad been
married twice. He was separated from
each wife, but retained the children, of
whom there were three. The two younger
are In Stockton. When sern to-day At
torney E. M. Gibson said: "We shall open
the contest at once, which will probaDly
be a big one, suing on behalf of Bluett's

THE PIE WAS NOT LOADED,
Walter Skerlock Seriously Injured bg a
Cartridge Secured in Exchange
for Pastru.
A soldier with a cartridge, a boy with a home-made pie, a string which
did duty fur a fuse and a lighted match were the chief features of a
tragedy which took place In the Western Addition last week and resulted
In Lane Hospital receiving a tearful and nearly blnided patient in the person
of 9-year-old Walter Skerloek.
A playmate of the injured boy vlalted Camp Merritt some days ago
and' made friends with a soldier, to whom he gave a pie his patriotic moth
er had sent out for the boys in blue. The boy with the pie. having an
eye for business, would not surrender the pastry to the young volunteer
until he had secured In exchange an army rifle cartridge. In the course
of events the piece of ordnance came Into the possession of Walter Sker
loek, who resides at 2422>^ Bush street, and trouble immediately began to
brew.
With the usual curiosity of youth, Skerloek wondered what would
happen if the powder in the little brass shell should be exploded. The
desire for knowledge grew so strong that he determined to prove for him
self that a theory he had formed aa to the effect was a correct one. A
hole he bored in the cartridge he filled with a piece of string in lieu
of a fuse, and with the admiring and envious glances of two younger
brothers upon him he touched a match to his embryo cannon. His theory
that there would be a beautiful noise and flash was proven to Skerlock's
entire satisfaction, but the flame which leaped from the cartridge is the
last thing the boy has seen since a week ago Thursday, when he per
formed his dangerous experiment.
The eyes of the youth received the full force of the flash from the
powder when the cartridge exploded and they were badly burned. The
injured boy was removed to Lane Hospital, where in a darkened room
with bandaged eyes he has had ample time to repent of his disastrous ex
periment with army supplies. The doctors have not been able to determine
whether the boy will lose his sight entirely or not. One eye was not
burned so badly as the other, and it Is believed this one will be saved,
and there are hopes for the other.
There has been no report as to the effect of the pie on the soldier, but
mothers of the numerous representatives of "young America" in the city
would not grieve much If the pastry caused a sleepless night and a trip
to the hospital for the misguided young volunteer.

An Important strike has been made in
the old and great Brown Bear mine at
Deadwood, Shasta County. The latest
discovery was made in the lower tunnel of
the mine on the Monte Cristo walls and is
the continuation of the ore chutes of the
upper levels. Its width is three feet
where it was cut. The ore is reported to
be quite rich and the ore body large. For
about thirteen years the fifteen stamps of
the Brown Bear mill have been hammer
ing away day and night with scarcely in
termission enough for repairs. Yet, thir
teen years ago the mine was considered
â¢worked out. Again, four years ago the
men at the helm took a gloomy view of
its future, but new men with more hope
ful views, renewed energy and more Intel
ligent prospecting kept things going and
raying as In the past. The mine is now
owned by J. W. Phillips of Oakland.
A rich rind is reported from Scott Moun

Redding has been spending the summer
prospecting there, while camping out by
a mountain stream with his family, as
many prospectors do. His find is a ledge
of freo gold seven ?eet wide and averag
ing $25 a ton. There will be many such
finds throughout fhat mining region of
Northern Trinity and Western Siskiyou.

The Melones mines near Robinsons Fer

The Yellow Aster Mining Company of
Riuidsburg has just made a two weeks'
clean-up at. the Barstow reduction works
of J25.000. For June this company paid a
dividend of $10,000 to its stockholders. In
addition to what they are crushing at Jo
hannesburg they are running thirty of
the fifty stamps at the Barstow reduction
workr-. It is stated that they have leased
that number of the stamps and are op
erating them under their own manage
ment.
It is currently rumored that changes In
the general management of the Barstow
Reduction Works will soon be made.
There is. in fact, good reason for believ
ing that some changes have already been
made, and that Albert Smit-i has resigned
as general manager. No specific reasons
are assigned for these changes, but it
seems to be pretty well known that the
stockholders were not satisfied with the
way in which things at the mill were be
i ing conducted. Last week a mortgage for
! $25,000 was tiled in the County Recorder's

The Good Hope mine, situated between
Penis and Elsinore, has been one of those
mines with a history peculiarly its own.
Several years ago it was sold to an En
glish syndicate for half a million dollars,
and Sluu.ow pnid down on account. A sci
entific gentleman of high education in
geological matters was .s^nt out from
London as Its superintendent, and every
thing- looked rosy. Suddenly the supply
of gold-bearing rock began to decrease
and the shart-holders brought suit to get
burk their mfiney, on the ground that
misrepresentations had been resorted to
in the sale of the property.
Since then the mine has had a varied
experience and a checkered existence.
But on Friday last the workmen ran into
an ore body of almost unparalleled mag
nitude, being quite fifty feet wide, at a
depth of 600 feet from the surface. The
rock is a low-grade ore, but said to be
rich enough to crush at a profit, while the
great extent of the deposit guarantees
that it will not soon be exhausted.â Los
Angeles Mining Record.
From Lew E. Aubury, assayer and min
ing engineer of this city, who returned
last week from a visit to the Rademaeher
district, near Randsburg. the following
Information of that section has been ob
tained: He speaks in glowing term 3 of It
and its possibilities. Outside of one or
two mines but little development has
been done, but what prospects have been
opened make a good showing. One of the
principal reasonÃ of the district not hav
ing made further advancement has been
on account of the class of ores. As a
rule, very little free gold property is met
with, the general character of the ores
being a sulphide of iron. In which the
gold is contained. The grade of the ores
Is comparatively high, but while not gen
erally good enough to stand shipment,
can be profitably treated on the ground
by modern processes.
A number of wells have been sunk and
water in abundance iias been reached In
from six to thirty-five feet. The proposed
electric-power line has been eurvi-yed
through the center of the district, and
should the projected line from the Kern
River to Randsburg be completed, with
cheai power and sufficient ore for treat
ment, the success of the district is as
sured. â Los Angeles Review.
The Selby Smelting and Lead Company
of San Francisco is prepared to pur
chase osm-iridium (a natural alloy uf
osmium and iridium) In quantities of one
ounce and upward. This metal, or alloy,
has been found in various placer mines
in California, particularly in the northern
part. Owing to its high specific gravity,
approximating closely to that of gold. In
washing sand and gravel it concentrates
with the gold. It can be easily distin
guished by its bright metallic color and
flat, scaly appearance, Is insoluble in acid,
and cannot be melted by ordjnary furnace
heat. The shape of grain is irregular, has
a ragged edge, and varies In size from
that of fine to coarse sand, and often
larger. As the market for osm-iridium
has been limited* little attention has been
paid to it on this coast, but it is believed
considerable quantities may be found If
miners -will turn their attention in that
direction.â Mining and Scientific Press.
Extension of demand and shortening of

LITTLE GOLD
FROM DAWSON
Return of the Leelanaw
Almost Bare.
BROUGHT NINE PASSENGERS
HITNDBEDS OF MINERS HELD
AT ST. MICHAELS.
The Overdue Steam Schooner Del
Norte and Her Tow of FivÂ«
Barges Are Safe at
Kodiak.
ThÂ« Alaska Exploration Company's
steamer Leelanaw arrived from St. Mich
ael yesterday with nine passengers. Very
few people came down the river while she
was north and very few went up. The
Brixham, Progreso, Rufus E. Wood and
a number of other vessels had their pas
sengers still aboard when the Leelanaw
sailed and the prospects were very poor
for any of the ' gold hunters getting to
Dawson this season. Hundreds of men
were stranded in and about St. Michael.
According to their contracts with outside
companies they should have been carried
to Dawson, but owing to the. fact that
nearly all the river steamers that started
from San Francisco, Portland and Puget
Sound for the Yukon have been wrecked
there is no means of fulfilling the agree
ment. A few of the gold hunters have
gone up the river on the steamers of
the Alaska Commercial Company, NorLh
American Trading and Transportation
Company and Alaska Exploration Com
pany, but the great majority are hoping
against hope that something will turn up
by which they may reach Dawson with
out a further expenditure of money.
Among those who came back on the
Leelanaw are Mrs. and Mrs. Qulsenberry.
The former went to Dawson last fall and
his wife went north on the Leelanaw and
mot him at St. Michael. Mr. and Mrs
Tod Smith met at St. Michael under ex
actly the same circumstances as Mr. and
Mrs Quisenberry. W. A. Cummings has
spent Jifteen years in Alaska. He and
his partner, Charles Wooge, brought
down 125,000 in dust with them.
E. L. Hemmingway and \V. \V. Turney
went in over the Chilkoot Pass and came
out on the first steamer that went down
the river. One week in Dawson was all
they wanted. Mr. Turney says there will
not be work for half the people that
are in Dawson thls winter, and that the
hardships will be very great.
r> Th j c aU'^F steamers and barges that T.
i . H. \\ hitelaw went north on the Sin
tram to build were not completed when
the Leelanaw was at Dutch Harbor. They
will be tinished In time for the stea.mer
t>. tow th m to St. Michael on her next
trip Nothing had been heard of the Mo
ran fleet of ten stern wheel steamers since
they were spoken in distress in Yakatat
Bay. The people at St. Michael never ex
pect to see one of them. They were all
badly strained and many of them unsea
worthy, according to the officers of the
Leelanaw.
When two days out from St. Michael
the Leelanaw passed a water-logged
stern wheel steamer. What vessel it was
and what steamer lost it could not be
ascertained. The old bark Husier, which
left here June 7 for Kotzebue Sound, had
arrived at St. Michael and was to ' con
tinue her Journey on July 23.
The steamer Del Norte, which left Seat
tle for St. Michael with live barges in
tow, is all right. Neither steamer nor
tow had been heard from for a long timÂ«
and they were almost giver up for lost.
They put into Kodlak on July 12. and
after filling the water tanks were to pro
ceed to either Sand Point or Kings Cove
for coal before venturing into Bering Sea
The first part of the journey was un
eventful, and the captain of the Del
N'orte- was in hopes of reaching St.
Michael with his tow in safety.
If all goes well the miners on the Klon
dike will be able to eat chicken on
Thanksgiving day. On the next trip of
the Leelanaw Dominick Roberts will ship
1200 chickens and 300 turkeys. The fowls
are going north in speclallv built coops
and a man is going with them to see that
they are fed properly. Chickens that
would be considered dear at 50 cents here
are expected to bring $10 apiece on the
Klondike.
Captain J. G. Blair, who has for years
been connected with the Alaska Commer
cial Company, is going to take a well
earned holiday. Now that the rush of
getting the Yukon steamers away is over
Captain Blair Is going to Byron Springs
for a fortnight.
The following report of Purser Tuttle of
the Leelanaw gives an accurate idea of
the condition of Bhlnping at St. Michael
when the steamer left for San Francisco:

DR. FIERCE'S REMEDIES
A SPANISH WOMAN'S TER-
RIBLE EXPERIENCE.
The Difference Between Spain's
Brutality to Women and
Anglo-Saxon Humanity.
Among; all the incidents of the Span-
ish-American war, one of those which
best illustrate the Spanish character is
the story of a wealthy woman refugee
driven from Santiago by fear of
bombardment returning again to find
her home and property pillaged and
destroyed by soldiers of her own race
and blood.
Imagine, if you can, such an occur-
rence in an American or an English
2Â§siÂ§~s ~?Â§^ 'j&L^ /
"NO WONDER THAT SPANISH REFUGEES SEEK AMERICAN PRO-
TECTION."
army! Imagine any one <-f the hun-
dred inhumanities and atrocities to-
ward women which characterize the
Spanish race being duplicated under
the rule of an Anglo-Saxon nation!
Impossible!
No wonder so many frightened refu-
' pees look upon the American army as
1 their deliverance from the hands of a
brutal and inhuman mob.
The way a nation treats its women is
i the mark of its standing among the
t world of nations, and shows in an in-
stant its state of civilization or of sav-
agery.
THE AMERICAN SENTIMENT.
Americans exalt their women as the
better part of the nation, and render
them such true, devoted homage as
I womankind receives in no other coun-
try In the world.
It is not mere lip-service nor the shal- I
low gallantry which parades itself in
: fine phrases and extravagant compll- j
: ments. It is the simple and sincere
j deference of genuine manhood toward
i the sex which Includes their mothers,
i sisters, sweethearts and wives.
How fully do American women ap-
preciate and reciprocate this obvious
sentiment of American manhood? It
is a question worth looking into. Do
the women of our country fully realize ;
the opportunities for happiness and i
power which lie within their grasp? i
If they should lose a large proportion
of the queenly heritage so freely ac-
corded and which rightfully belongs to
them, where lies the blame; and where-
in is the redress?
HOW IT IS SOMETIMES
THWARTED.
Many a woman â many a thousand !
womenâ throughout this land where j
womankind is loved and reverenced, j
lead lives of constant misery and sor- j
row. Many a woman feels that her >
dally lot is wretched and unhappy be- |
yond description. She is weighted j
down by a crushing burden of phys-
ical weakness that her husband cannot
understand, and for which he does not
know how to make allowance, simply
because he Is a man.
, He forgetsâ if indeed he ever realizes
â that a woman's entire existence, men-
tal as well as physical, is bound up in
and identified with the delicate and im-
portant special organism of woman-
hood. When a woman is peevish, fret-
ful, nervous, full of aches, pains and
constant miseries, he will seldom at-
tribute them to their actual cause.
WHERE THE BLAME LIES.
He will blame a woman's temper for
what is rightfully due to a condition of
disease and weakness. He will forget
his loyalty and patience; grow careless
of her feelings, neglectful and even per-
haps unkind. What should be the de-
light and comfort of domestic life is
embittered and sometimes almost de-
stroyed through mutual ignorance of
the great fundamental facts which con-
trol and color the woman's physical life.
Should there not be a more thorough
confidence and frank understanding be-
tween husbands and wives and between
mothers and daughters on this all im-
portant subject? Ought not every one
concerned to make this problem of re-
pairing the physical capacity, upon
which all other capability depends, the
foremost object of their earnest solici-
tude?
The kindest of husbands cannot fully
sympathize with what he does not un-
derstand. However terribly a woman
suffers she hates to be complaining of
ill-health all the time; she hates to ac-
knowledge that she has any weakness
of this nature. If she calls in the doc-
tor, nine times in ten the inex]>erienced
local practitioner does not diagnose the
trouble correctly. He prescribes for
liver disease or heart-weakness; or he
may say: "Your nerves and stomach
need a little toning up; that's all." He
will seldom recognize the fact that the
real trouble is in the organs distinctly
feminine, the special. Intricate and sen-
sitive structure which fits a woman for
wifehood and motherhood.
WHY WOMEN HESITATE.
When a sensitive modest woman once
fairly realizes the cause of the con-
tinual aches and pains that are sapping
her vitality and making her life a fail-
ure, one of the first thoughts that come
to her Is a dread of the mortifying
questioning, examinations and local ap-
plications which doctors so uniformly
insist upon; and It seems to her almost
as if it were better to endure her con-
stant pains and miseries than submit
to this embarrassing ordeal.
ONE WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE.
The fact that such an alternative Is
entirely needless; that there is a per-
fect and unfailing remedy by which her
troubles may be absolutely cured in the
privacy of her own home without resort
DR. PIEBCE'S REMEDIES
to these repugnant methods, comes to
many a woman like a revelation of
mercy and deliverance. "For one year
I sufferei more than a tongue can ex-
press," says Mrs. Lily Heckart of Bart-
lesville, Cherokee Nation, Ind. Ter. "I
was in bed nearly all the time. I was
scarcely able to work half of the time.
I could not even dress myself. God
alone knows what I suffered. I had
falling of the womb so badly that at
times I could not be turned in bed. I
suffered from palpitation of the heart. I
would often faint away and it seemed
as if I never could recover. I had sick
headache nearly all the time, and also
had St. Titus' dance. At the com-
mencement of the monthly period the
misery would be so great- that I would
be nearly crazy; this would last from
twelve to twenty-four hours, and I
would suffer untold agony. When I
would stand on my feet it seemed as
though the top of my head would
come off, and I had almost lost mem-
ory when I commenced using Dr.
Pierces n.edicines. I had doctored with
five different physicians but they did
me no good. They finally said they had
done all they could.
WHAT HER DOCTOR SAID.
"One of these doctors, of forty years'
experience, said to me: 'I can't do you
; any {food, so why not try Dr. R. V.
Pierces Favorite Prescription?" So I
decided to write to Dr. Pierce and de-
scribe my troubles. He wrote me a
nice, fatherly kind letter ;,i reply and
I followed his advice. I took three bot-
tles each of Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre-
scription and 'Golden Medical Discov-
ery," and by the time I had finished
these I had no symptoms of the old
disease. 1 was soon aLle to do all my
work. I now do all of my own sewing
and am heavier than ever before; I
weigh 145 pounds, and my husband
says I look the same as when I was
young. Life is a pleasure to me now,
j instead of a burden, as it was before I
! commenced using Dr. Pierces medi-
cines. I can now enjoy the society of
my friends, and Dr. Pierces medicines
j have done me more good than all the
doctors ever did.
"Three of my neighbors have used
Dr. Pierces medicine and It has
helped them all. I will take no other
medicine but Dr. Pierces, and 1 re-
! commend it to all my friends. I am
i willing to answer any letters of In-
i quiry if stamps are Inclosed for reply."
AN EMINENT SPECIALIST.
This superb remedy was devised by
an educated and experienced physi-
cian, who for thirty years has been at
the head of one of the representative
j medical institutions of America: The
j Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute
of Buffalo, N. Y. Here Dr. Pierce, as
i chief consulting physician, has success-
fully treated more cases of chronic
feminine diseases than any other physi-
cian in the United States.
There never was another medicine
devised which restored complete health
and pure vital capacity to the womanly
organism so promptly and radically as
this matchless "Favorite Prescription."
It absolutely dispels all abnormal and
diseased conditions peculiar to women,
however severe and obstinate they may
appear.
THERE IS NO OTHER.
It is the only medicine Invented by a
skilled and eminent specialist which
banishes the anxieties of prospective
motherhood, and relieves the trying or-
deal of all its dangers and a large pro-
portion of its pains and discomforts.
"I began taking your 'Favorite Pre-
scription' in August, 1897, and took it
until after my baby was born in No-
vember," writes Mrs. Mollie E. Grimes
of Flomnton, Escambia County, Ala.
"I took three bottles of the 'Favorite
Prescription' and one bottle of your
little "Pellets' and oh, what an appetite
they did give me!
"My baby is now three months old
and weighs fifteen pounds and a half.
When she was born she was the fattest
little baby girl you ever saw. She was
the largest one of all my babies and at
the birth I had an easier and shorter
time than I ever had. I suffered every-
thing that flesh could suffer with all the
rest of my children, and I was also sub-
ject to miscarriage.
"After having this trouble twice I
was almost heart-broken to think I
could not raise any more children and
had tp suffer as I did. I took your
'Favorite Prescription' and also your
little 'Pellets' (I do not forget them for
they act like a charm), and now I am
the happy mother of a fine baby girl
I am stouter and healthier than I ever
was. I think all prospective mothers
should use Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre-
scription. I cannot praise it enough,
for I believe it saved my baby's life.
What your medicine did for me I want
published."
IT INVOLVES NO DANGERS.
No alcohol nor opiate, no false stimu-
lant, no dangerous narcotic of any sort
or description whatever, enters into the
composition of this great "Prescrip-
tion." It is utterly free from all those
delusive elements which so largely
compose various "compounds," "malt-
extracts," and so-called "tonics," which
tend to give a mere temporary exhilar
ation followed by severe depression
and are liable, if persisted in, t
awaken a morbid Intemperate cravin
for alcoholic stimulants. Dr. Pierce'
Favorite Prescription is a temperanc
remedy, pure and simple. The strengt
it gives is temperance strength; tru
nerve force; genuine, sound, endurin
vitality.
Dealers in medicines everywhere ar
provided with this great "Prescrip
tion" and will supply it on requea

once his lack of business honesty and
his contempt for their judgment. Do
not be misled or beguiled. If you have
made up your mind that Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription is the remedy
you need, stick to it, and insist upon
that and nothing else.
A HUSBAND'S DUTY.
Every husband of a suffering wife;
every mother of a delicate, ailing
daughter, should make it a business to
write to Dr. R. V. Pierce, at Buffalo,
N. T., for a letter of sound, sensible,
professional advice, which will be sent
promptly, and entirely without charge.
In any case, where desirable and prac-
ticable. Dr. Pierce will suggest special
self-treatment at home without a phy-
sician's aid.
Inviolable confidence Is of course the
unvarying rule that governs every
communication received by Dr. Pierce.
No letter is ever published without the
writer's express permission. No sen-
sitive woman need hesitate to seek so
certain a relief which involves no sac-
rifice of time or privacy.
A GRAND VOLUME FREE.
Every family should possess a copy
of Dr. Pierces great thousand-page il-
lustrated Common Sense Medical Ad-
viser â a magnificent nome medical
library in one volume. Nearly a million
copies were sold at $1 50 each, but a
free copy in strong paper covers will
now be sent for the bare cost of mail-

Own Record.
FASTEST MILE OF THE YEAR
ONCE AROUND A SLOW TRACK
IN 1:59 1-4.
Chehalis and Anaconda Add to Their
Laurels by Capturing Pacing
Events at the Colum
bus Track.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, OOf. f Aug. 6.-This was
getaway day at the Columbus Park.
Only four of the five events were fin
ished, on account of several of the races
being badly split. Fully live thousand
people were in attendance, attracted by
the announcement that Star Pointer
would attempt to lower the track rec
ord of 2:01%, made last year by Joe
Patchen in his race with Pointer. The
track was not as fast as it ordinarily
is under favorable conditions and teams
were working it between heats all day.
It was hardly expected that Pointer
would lower even the track record, and
when it was announced he had equaled
his record of l:S9tt, made last season at
Glenn Falls, the crowd went wild with
enthusiasm.
It was after 4 o'clock when Pointer
was brought out for the test. The
breeze which had blown up the stretch
at a merry clip for several hours had
died down and the pennant on the
judges 4 stand clung to the staff. The
first time Pointer was brought down to
the wire he did not have his stride and
went, almost to tfe half before he
turned back. It was about 4:20 when
- brought him down the second
time. The stallion was as steady as a
machine and Geers nodded for the
word. George Spear drove the pace
maker, a runner hitched to a sulky,
and the start was a beautiful one.
The crowd was on its feet before
Pointer was under the wire and there
was a painful silence until the stallion
n ached the quarter, when it was an
nounced that the time was :29HÂ« This
brought forth a shout of exultation, for
it was seen Pointer was giving a re
markahV performance. There was an
other Bhout when Pointer reached the
half in :58% and still another when he
reached the three-quarter pole in 1:28%,
for it was then certain that the mile
would be under two minutr-s. As
Pointer rame into the stretch h;~
plowed up the dust as the bow of a
tug plowed up smooth water. There
was a smile on McCleary's face and
wh>-n the runneY moved up at the finish
Pointer pushed his nose ahead and k<-pt
it there until he passed under the wire.
A mighty cheer went up from the crowd,
for the next Instant the time, 1:59^4,
was announced.
The 2:05 pace was easily won by Che
halis, although Bumps and Pearl On
ward both sold for more money in the j
poota. The second heat, 2:o4\i. was the
fastest heat paced in a race this sea
son. Summari's:

MICHAEL TOO FAST
FOR EDDIE M'DUFFEE
PHILADELPHIA. Aug. 6.â Jimmy Mi
' chael'to-day defeated Eddie McDuffee in
! a 25-mile paced rare on the TVillow Grove
track, but McDuffee will probably protest
the race. McDuffee signed a contract to
' race Michael fifteen miles. The American
: - Cycle Racing Association, however, ad
| vertised the race to be twenty-live miles,
'â  and over 15.000 persons traveled to Willow
I Grove to witness it. There was cunsider
| able dissatisfaction when the spectators
. learned that the race was to be of but
â  fifteen miles. It was finally announced
i that McDuffee had consented to ridÂ»- the
: twenty-five miles in order not to disap
point the crowd.
ThÂ»-re was nothing remarkable about
' the race and no records were broken. Dur
ing the entire race neither rider got with
in ten seconds of the record. Michael took
the lead at the start and increased It to
I seventy-five yards at the end of the first
! mile, "in the second lap of the second
'â  mile one of Michael's pacing machines
' broke a chain, which allowed McDuffee to
gain on the midget. Michael, however,
! soon caught another fast team and at the
, end of the third led by 100 yards. McDuf
fee then began to cut down Michael's lead
i until on the sixth mile Michael was but
i twenty-five yards in front.
In the eighth mile Michael made a slow
i pick up and McDuffee had a chance to
| pass him, but slowed up rather than take
! the lead. It waa evident that neither man
was trying his best, and the spectators
I several times hissed the riders. At the
i end of the eleventh mile McDuffee offered
; tne spectators a littie excitement by
; catching a fast quint and passing Michael.
! From the twelfth to the eighteenth mile
| the men "loafed." On th" nineteenth Mi
chael spurted and regained the lead. From
here to the finish th< race became excit
ing. Both ny n did their beat. Michael led
by fifty yards at the beginning of the
tweafy-fiith mile. Try as he would the
Boston boy could not catch the little rider
I and Michael crossed the tape winner by
': thirty yards.

1206â MARKET 5T.â 1206.
MRS. DR. F. CLARK.
The World's Greatest Medium and Clairvoy-
ant has located permanently at 1206 MARKET
STREET.
TRUTHFUL IN HER PREDICTIONS.
RELIABLE IN HER ADVICE.
No matter what trouble you may have with
yourself or others, come and Fhe will guide
you. She advises with a certainty by a higher
than human power.
SHE IS UNRIVALED.
MRS. DR. CLARK IS RECOGNIZED BY
THE* PRESS,
I Medical faculty, and
scientists generally as
the foremost medium in
the country, and should
not be classed with card
readers, fortune tellers,
palmists, as t rologers
and similar humbugs.
Many men with a busi-
ness which ought to
make them rich strug-
gle for years and simply
make a livlns. Many
devoted women who
would give their life
for husband, son, broth-
er, or lover are con-
stantly abused or slight-
ed. That these condi-
tions are often con-
trolled by "Ocr-ULT"
influences which can
be changed to others
that work for good
financially and social-
ly has bepn known by a
few in every age. The
first ROTHSCHILD was
constantly guided by
clairvoyant i n fluence,
and many successful
Americans seek this ad-
j vice regularly. The
I clairvoyant gift is Im-
: parted to so few and in
such varying degree*
that Impostors abound
in every large city.
Hence many educated
persons who secretly
wish for Its aid are
I sensitive about seeking
j it. This timidity is
rapidly d 1s a ppearlng
among the better class
of San Francisco citi-
zens since the renown-
ed MRS. CLARK RE-
CENTLY DECIDED TO
MAKE SAN FRAN-
CISCO HER HOME.
HER REVELATIONS
ARE MOST WONDEiR-
i FUL, and acknowledged
to be of the highest or-
der, not made to satisfy
idle curiosity only, but
Intended to give those
who seek the truth a
permanent benefit. She
does not cater to the
superstition of the Ig-
! norant and credulous
; people. If you are in
! doubt she can and will
perform all she claims,
feel yourself invited to
call and she will give
you a more substantial
proof of her marvalous
power than you have
: ever before received
! from mortal. If mar-
; rtage. slcknpss, death?,
changes, travels, di-
vorces, separations, law-
suits, business trans-
actions, wills, deeds,
mortgages, lost or ab-
eent friends interest
; you, if you desire to be
more successful, If you
desire to have your do-
! mestic troubles re-
j moved, your lost love
returned, your bitterest
enemies converted Into
stanch friends âIn a
word, whatever may be
your troubles, suspi-
cions, or desires.
CALL ON THIS GIFTED WOMAN
And she will send you away happier, wiser and
bolder than before.

Horseshoers to Race.
The final heats of the great horseshoe
ing tournament under the auspices of the
Mechanics' Athletic Union, U. S. A., will
take place at Central Park this afternoon.
Considerably rivalry exists between the
winners of last Sunday's contest, and,
although Frank O'Rourke made the best
time, Henry G rlach, who won the first
heat over James O'Rourke, says he will
show the public a much better record to
day. James O'Rourke was not at his best
last Sunday and his many friends think
he will pull up even with the best in the
concluding heats. Thomas Ticrney th!nk3
he was handicapped by not having as hot
a fire as FranK. O'Rourlje, and says he
will look well to that fact this afternoon.
It will be remembered that Frank
O'Rourke won by a margin of only throe
seconds, so great results may be expected
to-day.
In addition to the above programme
there will be another exhibition of Stanl
forth's patent dog racJrrÂ« course with fox
terriers. About thirty dogs are entered
and during the afternoon several races
will be given. Many of the little dogs
have been tried out during the week and
have made as good a showing in their
way as first-class race horses and as
soon as the sport loving puhlic become
acquainted with the dogs and their rec
ords no doubt the sport will assume as
large proportions as coursing.

Kicking Over Nothing, Protesting
and Playing Poorly Make the
Battle TTninteiasting
and Miserable.
BY JOE CORBETT.
A long drawn-out, poorly played con
test, devoid of vivacity, interest, enthusi
asm and everything: else which tends to
make a game pleasing, was the pro
gramme yesterday afternoon at Recrea
tion Park when the Oaklands defeated
the Stocktons by the score of S to 6.
I have seen many ; a game drag since
the consolidation, but I must say this one
stands in a class by Itself. It was pro
vokingly slow and made so, mind you, by
the players themselves. It was "take
your time going to bat, to the field and
returning." It really looked as though
the men were performing- against their
will. The warm weather might have
causod the trouble, but I have always en
tertained the belief that a warm atmos-
phere was desirable to all players, young
and old. I might be wrong, but one
thing is certain. Sullivan, when put out at
second, should have hurried off the field,
instead of holding a heated conversation
with himself, and delaying things until
"patience ceased to be a virtue." There
is no excuse for him unless it be the fact
that he caught an excellent game and
just hammered that ball for keeps every
time he came up. It did not always go
safe, but it went out on a line, and oc
casioned runs.
While Sullivan was the principal, he
was not the only offender. That crack
third baseman, Lang, had a finger in the
pie, and caused a delay of about ten
minutes over a decision at third base, and
put the finishing touches to his strange
behavior by protesting the game.
I cannot to this minute understand why
he protested the game. He claimed that
the decision at his base was decidedly
wrong, but I must confess I saw nothing
wrong about it, and if Lang had made the
play properly there would have been no
occasion for a kick.
Whalen was caught between third and
home, and during the "run-hlm-down"
proceeding he evaded Lang by a clever
slide. The third baseman strenuously ob
jected to his being safe, and this kick
being unproductive, the protest lollowed.
From the press box it appeared as though
uhalcn. by a clever slide, evaded Lang
and if he were far enough out of the line
in accomplishing this rather difficult feat
I for one did not notice it, and after the
game I discovered that "there were oth
ers."
So It was all through the contest. If a
player was not walking around as though
on parade he was kicking, and I can not
recall one instance where a performer
got a move on.
This kind of work will never do, as pro
longing the game robs it of its interest,
and yesterday's contest was not interest
ing, save for the first two innings. It
did. for this brief period, look like a
game of baseball.
The Stocktons, through the valuable
assistance of three clear base hits, made
one run. Two more singles, with their
opponents' assistance, gave them two
runs in the third, and a feeling that they
would emerge victorious was prevalent.
It was shattered to smithereens, however,
for in this same inning the Oaklands
opened up on Mr. Whalen, and before the
curtain was rung down on the confusing
scene seven large runs had crossed the
plate, and what little interest had been'
harbored at the outset was dissipated.
This fatal inning to the Stockton cause
was confusing, but not to such an ex
tent that a chance to view what was
occurring became impossible. Had it not
been for a couple of yellow errors on the
part of Muller and Starkey, Stockton
might have won that game. But it was
not to be, I'guess. for never did two er
rors do such damage. Each time they
occurred the bases were full, and it was
really horrifying to see that bal! escape.
Muller's mistake was on a line hit off
Sullivan's bat. He hardly had to move
for the sphere, and when it lit squarely
in his hands and then dropped out again,
a groan, the like of which I have not
heard this season, came tearing over the
stands. But this was not all. Starkey's
mishap came next, and when he also per
mitted a grounder to leave his hands, the
groan of disgust became unbearable.
It certainly was a sad sight, and, as I
said before, all Interest in the game was
lost after this miserable inning. A mag
nificent running catch by Van Norden
toward the latter part of the game re
vived things a bit, and had not the game
been irretrievably lost this catch would
have caused a whirlwind of applause, as
it was a pretty play and was deserving
of all it received.
The Stocktons crawled up a trifle to
ward the end, but this was the direct re
sult of Moskiman's careless pitching.
After his cohorts made that rally in the
third inning he became indifferent and
his indifference will be the death o* some
one one of these days. Pc hit Selna on
the head with a ball and there was no
reason why he^should have done so. It
came from carelessness and indifference,
and a pitchor, above all, should not pos
sess these qualities. Mosklman should
get on to himself, to. use a slang expres
sion, or he will injure some player one
of these days for life. Selna's escape was
wonderful. The score follows:

The Great Match Race Between Con

Will Be Run at In
gleside.
A large and enthusiastic crowd wit
nessed good coursing- yesterday afternoon
at Union Coursing Park. The day was
beautiful, and as a result the hares ran
strong and game. It was a great day for
those who played the shortenders, several
long shots capturing flags.
Much interest was manifested in the
L race between John Kerrigan's Lalla
Rookh and A. Johnson's Tod Sloan.
Lalla got a bad slip, but caught her op
ponent before the game was reached. The
hare swerved from its line and Tod was
favored by the move. Pie made two
wrenches and a kill before Lalla could
possibly score, fine, however, proved to
be very fast and may land the next big
stake she will try for.
Daisy Deane sent Gallagher, a 3 to 1
favorite, to his kennel without a flag.
Lady Campbell ran a brilliant course with
Grasshopper and may be among the win
ners of the big prizes to-day.
The upset of the loafer Right Bower by
PaJmer Hill burned holes in the pockets
of the knowing ones. Right Bower .vas
played strongly in the pools at 7 to 1, but
Instead of going right after his game he
remained behind his opponent and played
for a drive and kill, much to the disgust
of his backers. Governor Markham and
Arno had two no-goes, but the Governor
finally won the course.
Several good judges thought that Arno
had fairly beaten his opponent in the first
course and should have had a flag raised
in his favor.
Tocaloma easily beat Our Boy, a strong
favorite. The last named dog ran as If
he was either sick or completely out of
condition. Mission Tip and Peaceful Glen
had also two "no-goes," but In the third
course Mission Tip, who was on the short
end. won.

COURSING AT INGLESIDE.
_____
Master Mat Downs Sunburst â Great
Interest Manifested in the Big
; Match Race To-Day.' ',
i A large crowd went to Ingleside yester- j
I day to watch the puppies show their
| mettle. The running throughout the day
I was good â  and the hares were exception
; ally fast, giving the dogs in almost every
] instance a gruelling course. : .
In the main, the talent enjoyed the best
i of it, but the shortenders got in occasion
; ally. In two instances the former class
! were given heavy falls. The first drop |
I occurred when Liberty met Trinket, j
' Trinket was looked upon as a sure win- '
I ncr, but Lynch & Mayer's dog ran all !
around him at odds of 4 to 1. The last ;
course of the day, between Sunburst and j
Master Mat, proved another surprise to !
j the talent. They bet heavily on his win- :
j ning, and even played him as being the 'â 
\ winner of the stake. Their surprise was !
great when the white flag decided Master
Mat the winner, at odds of 3 to 1. .
To-day the champions ' will go to the |
slips first, and then the puppies will fight
it out. During the morning's running the j
first heat of the match race between j
Connemara and False Flatterer will be !
run. After lunch the deciding heats of
this great race will take place, and It is
thought that the park will be too small
to hold the crowd when the heats come
off. Already many thousands have been
bet on the rival candidates, and, judging
by the interest taken in the outcome of I
the race, the dogs will go to slips with j
their weigtits in gold in the Dool-boxes. .
Since Sunburst was defeated Rathbone
has been picked as the likely winner of
the puppy stake. Golden Russet, May- I

heats. Following is the way the dogs

MISSED HIS PURSE.
A Fireman Arrested for Grand Lar
ceny as a Result of a Game
of Euchre.
Edward McCloskey. an extra man 1n
the Fire Department, was arrested early
yesterday morning by Detectives Fitzger
ald and Graham and Policeman Callinan
and booked at the City Prison on a
charge of grand larceny.
He is accused by Timothy Flynn. a con
tractor in the Mission, of stealing his
purse, containing $186. Friday afternoon
Flynn went to the shoe store of Charles
Seheper, 214 Clipper street. Several men
were playing euchre for %l a corner, and
the old man was induced to take a hand,
a young woman promising to keep him
posted on the game.
The "growler" was rushed repeatedly,
and when the game broke up Flynn
missed his purse. Every one denied
knowing anything about it, and Flynn re
ported the matter at the Seventeenth
street station.
Detectives Fitzgerald and Graham
were detailed on the case, and after mak
ing an investigation they went in search
of McClosLey, who was one of the party
of euchre players. They found him in a
ealoon on Market and Brady streets at an
early hour yesterday morning and placed
him under arrest. Flynn swore to a com
plaint charging him with the crime in
Judge Mogan's court.
McCloskey denies taking the purse and
points to the fact that when searched at
the prison only 15 cents was found in his
pockets.

The parade commiuee reported that It
had selected D. A. Ryan of Pacific Parlor
as marshal of the night parade and that
it suggested that invitations be sent to
the Society of California Pioneers, Ex
empt Firemen and Veteran Firemen to
I take part in the night parade in this city
j on the Bth of September and in the day
i parade in San Jose on the 9th. The re
port was adopted.
Mr. Theisen said that in some of tho
; parlors of the city there seemed to be a
| desire, Qn account of either economy or
I to hold back for the 1900 celebration, tor
some of the parlors not to take part in
the celebration. He said that if that
: spirit prevails there will be danger of k>B
1 ing the rate allowed by the Southern Pa
| ciflc Company.
It was suggested that those parlors
that will not participate in this city and
in San Jose should forfeit all interest
in the benefits of the committee.
This led to a discussion, after which a
! motion carrying out the suggestion was
I adopted.
It was resolved that each parlor shalj
furnish the treasurer of the committee a
certified check for the number of tickets
it will take.
The committee decided to have a spe^fal
train for San Jose from this city on this
evening of the Bth and one at 8 o'clock
from Alameda.
Mr. Grant moved that a committee of
five of the most influential Native Sons be
appointed to wait on Governor Budd and
have him declare September 10, which
will fall on a Saturday, a legal holiday,
but the motion was lost. A motion to
haA'e a special train leave San Jos>e by
the broad gauge at 9 o'clock p. m. on
the 9th, one by the narrow gauge at 11
p. m. and one by the broad gauge at
2 o'clock on the morning of the 10th was
made, but the matter was referred to the
transportation committee.
Mr. Dinkelspiel stated that while in San
Jose a few days since he had a. conver
sation with Dr. Gaston, the grand mar
shal of the San Jose parade, who assured
him that the celebration in the Garden
City will be a great success in every par

A proposition to appoint a special re
porter to prepare matter from the par
lors in relation to the celebration for tha

on the table.
A motion to reconsider the resolution
by which the rate of tickets was fixed at

at $1 50. The tickets will be good for flva
days.
The meeting then adjourned until next

READY TO REVOLT
AGAINST THE RAID
ON SAN FRANCISCO
Alameda County Democrats De
nounce the McNab-Gould
Combination. |
Dr. Pardee Is Smarting Under the Lash of
Public Opinionâ Objects to
Exposure.
OAKLAND, Aug. 6.â Throughout the
length and breadth of Alameda County
the. Democrats are most outspoken in
their denunciation of the McNab-
Gould-Alford plot to strangle the party
in Pan Francisco. There are many
Democrats here who are stanch sup
porters of Maguire for Governor, but
they, too, with hardly an exception, are
as strong in their criticism as those
who do not believe in the "Little
â¢.Spotted Giant."
â M. J. Laymance is one of these. Mr.
Laymance was chairman of the Dem
.. ocratic County Committee for several
terms up to two years ago, when he
was Bucceeded by Con. Brosnahan.
r his guidance the Democrats cut
down the Republican majorities in Ala
meda County to such an extent as to
â  s.end their banner to Los Angeles
â â¢County, where it remained until two
S ago. Laymance is a Maguire
â  -ninn, not a rabid, Popocratic Maguire
ite, who believes the Congressman's
â¢WxTd is gospel, but a cool, level headed
man who considers thai present
conditions Maguire is the most availa
ble candidate.
To-day Mr. Laymance discussed the
â¢situation across the bay and its effect
on the interior of the State. He did
not hesitate to denounce the action of
the committee of une hundred in pre
venting an open selection of delegates
to the State convention by primary as
un-Democratic and dangerous in the
extreme, and a proceeding that threat
ened the annihilation of the party.
Regarding the proposed movement
'looking to the unseating of the entire
McNab delegation Mr. Laymance ad
-.'''"znitted he had heard some such plan
â¢discussed, but could not say what the
chances were for its being carried into
effect. He had received information
that among the northern counties that
would be arrayed against the "whisper
â¢ing" delegation were Colusa and Glenn,
which would send delegations strongly
favoring such a plan, and he believed
there were many others if, indeed, all
did not swing into line. He said it was
a difficult matter, however, to organize
a successful fight agrainst so largre a
W)dy, thoroughly equipped for their
own defense, united and led by astute
politicians, while their opponents, di
vided into many bodies, would find it
.-.difficult to get together for effective
work.
' As to Alameda County, Mr. Lay-
itiahce said there was no contest, nor
would there be unless, perhaps, in a
' few instances where personal contests
'might take place. But as to there be
ing two tickets in the field, as in the
case of the Republicans, there would be
..iipthing of the kind.
â '..; He believed the majority of the
-pefriocrats here were friendly to lta
guire and would support him. but he
also belteved they were just as strong
ly opposed to the great fraud practic
â  ed In Sun Francisco and would not
.v hesitate to resr-nt it if the slightest op
â  .-portunity offered.
. ' . Mr. Laymancu is righi in saying there
: will be no contest here over the elec
tion of delegates to the State Conven
tion, and "he is also correct in his opin
' . ion that if th>.- opportunity occur to dls
cipHne the McNabe ar.d Goulds and
Poppers and Alfords and others of that
Ilk, they will avail themselves of it
.with cheerful alacrity. W. W. Foote
â¢â leading the old guard in Oakland and
Tarpey in full control on the south side
â¢of the estuary Alumtda County will
â¢ VÂ»end a delegation to Sacramento pre
â  .pared to unite in any movement for the
â¢ purification of the party.
.' . Dr. George C. Pardee has been driven
to the extremity of resorting to vituper
ation to offset the Call's exposure of
' ..hie numerous political perfidies. The
announcement this morning that the
doctor, in base violation of his repeated
assertions that If he could not get a
majority of the Alameda delegation for
â¢ himself he would do all in his power to
,' . give his votes to Davis, had entered in
to a compact with Secretary of State
..Brown to turn his strength to that gen
. tleman, caused a genuine sensation in
. local political circles.
â  Everybody watched for the doctor's
personal organ to make its appearance
i
t to see what Pardee had to say about it.
I There was not a word, editorially, re
gardinr the matter, but on one of the
local pages the individual who attends
to the doctor's personal booming de
voted a half-column to abuse of an at
tache of The Call, whom both the
writer and Dr. Pardee knew perfectly
well had nothing whatever to do with
The Call's exposure. The flood of in
vective poured forth tells all too plain
ly how hard hit Pardee is, and it falls
far short of its purpose. The evident
intention of the unfortunate penman
was to lead the casual reader to believe
the article to be a denial of the charge,
but after uncorking the vials of his own
wrath he credits his master with a
mass of about as undignified, senseless
rot as a cornered candidate for office
ever turned loose. Like his hired man,
Pardee carefully refrained from making
a derinite denial of the truth of The
Call's charge and it would be unavail
ing if he did, for there are many men in
Uukland who know that Pardee and
Brown's political manager have reached
an understanding.
Of course the people feel ugly toward
Pardee for his scheming to drive the
nomination away from Alameda Coun
ty unless he gets it himself and knowl
edsre of this sentiment, no doubt,
prompted the doctor to rush into print
again with the usual disastrous re
sults.
Proof of the alliance between Pardee
and Hilborn, whereby the doctor is to
do what he can to advance the Con
gressman's interests, is accumulating
daily and up to the present the doctor
has restrained himself from comment
on it in the columns of his organ. Men
from the country districts report that
no effort is made to conceal the exist
ence of the compact in their districts
and the Metealf men are becoming less
: and less tolerant of Pardee. Many of
Metcalf s supporters are, or have been,
friendly to Pardee, but if it came to
a choice between the two they would
not hesitate an instant in throwing the
latter overboard, for once Metcalf
makes a friend he retains him for all
time, while Pardee seems to have the
misfortune to make friends only to lose
them.
One effect of the Brown incident is
I to increase the sentiment in favor of
'an unfnstructed delegation. Here in
j Oakland, Pardee's stronghold, this de
' mand is growing and it would not sur
j prise even his own friends if at least
three wards â possibly fotir â revolted
from the doctor's policy of dictation in
the matter of delegates and, following
Alameda's lead, elect men entirely free
; to act as they choose.
Meanwhile Pardee continues to go be
fore the people nightly clamoring for
the unit rule, by which he seeks to cap
ture the solid delegation in the event
of his carrying a majority.
The fusion Populists are keeping
quiet nowadays, but are watching the
course of the Democrats with intense
eagerness. They admit that if the San
Francisco delegation should be un
' seated and Maguire defeated for the
nomination, they would be In Identi
cally the same predicament as the fly
that tobogganed down the side of the
tureen.
On the other hand the straight-out
Populists, headed by Fowler and
Bretz, are working away industriously,
never missing an opportunity to re
claim a wanderer from the true path
of Populism who may have strayed into
the broader road of Popoeracy, and are
arranging to put a complete county
ticket in the field. They declare their
determination to stand by Shanahan
to the end, and say that many who
were lured over to the other side for a
time have come back to them and that
there will be many more.
For a Free Church.
OAKLAND, Aug. 6.â Word has been
received from New York that the decli
nation of Rev. Dr. Co vie of this city to
accept the call tendered him by the Madl

York has resulted in a discussion of a
free church plan as applied Jo New York
churches. The late pastor of the church
named is president of the open and in
stitutional church league. Dr. Coyle
based his declination on the fact that
while the salary offered was J7OOO a year,
he did hot believe the enterprise of a free
church ha 4 the necessary backing.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, ATjqUST 7, 1898.
SIMONS SUIT
DISMISSED
The Young Husband Is
in a Hurry to Be Free.
COMPLICATIONS OF LAWYERS
MBS. SIMONS' FATHER ORDERED
A STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
The Lady's Friends Say That She
Will Have No Difficulty in
Proving Her Right to
a Decree.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 6.
Much surprise Is expressed in Alame
da that the divorce suit filed by Mrs.
Nancy Simons against her wealthy young
husband should be so quickly dismissed.
The suit was filed a few weeks ago and
the answer was filed next day, but, al
though time was set for taking testimony
before the Commissioner, the evidence
was never heard. The peculiarity of the
case consists In the fact that, according
to young Simons, Attorney R. B. Tappan
seems to have attended i.o both Bides of
the matter. Mr. Tappan says he was au
thorized to begin suit for Mrs. Simons,
and her husband says that he consulted
the same attorney, and he "guesses" that
he attended to whatever was filed on his
behalf.
Young Simons was seen at his home,
MRS. ERNEST SIMONS (Formerly MISS NANCY
CULVER), Whose Pictured Face Has Beeo Cut
Out of the Family Group.
1105 Park avenue, Alameda, and asked
whether some settlement had been ar
rived at and whether he and his wife
had concluded to live together in peace
once more. He replied: "I would as soon
tie a stone about my neck and jump into
the bay. I do not wish to say anything,
but if my wife fails in securing a divorce
I will most certainly sue for a separation
myself. I have sufficient grounds upon
which to base such a suit.
"When she commenced suit it was
agreed that I pay the costs. I was will
ing, by all means, to pay these ana so
informed her attorney, Mr. Tappan. I
was going to let the case go by default,
and she would have had a decree had her
father not interfered.
"Of course, they were afraid T was going
to fight the case, and thought I hail filed
a cross-complaint, when in reality we
simply filed an answer, or a general denial
I believe it was. I really had no attorney,
but I guess Attorney Tappan filed this
document, as 1 was to pay the expenses
anyway. I ought to have brought suit
myself, and it would now be over with.
I certainly will have nothing more to do
with her, and here is a picture of her in
our family, and I don't want it there any
longer"- and young Simons deliberately
destroyed the photograph by tultir"
young Mrs. Simons' picture out or the
Attorney K. B. Tappan insists that he
was attorney for Mrs. Nancy Simons, and
that he filed the suit in due process of
law "Mrs. Simon? called at my office
several weeks ago." said Attorney Tappan
to-day, "and remained there over half an
hour The outcome was that I was re
tained by her to bring the divorce suit. I
had nothing to do with her father, nor
with Luclen Simons, nor his son, the de
fendant In the divorce proceedings. The
elder Simons, however, called on me a
few days ago and asked when the case ;
was to be tried. I told him it would come I
off the first week in August. Lucien Si- \
mons then went to San Fracisco to see i
Mrs. Simons' father. The latter pretend- :
ed to have a grievance to the effect that
young Simons had filed a cross complaint.
When Simons explained that it was sim
ply an answer, Mrs. Simons' father con
sented to have the case go to trial. W hile
Mr Simons was at my office to relate
these facts to me after his return from
San Francisco, her father advised me by
telephone that after all he proposed to
have the suit dismissed. Ernest G. Simons
deserted his wife over a year ago. The
couple were not congenial to each other
and lived apart. So the two paternal
heads came together to arrange about
the separation of their children. That 3
all" there was to it in a nutshell. I was
certainly authorized to begin the suit, and
any one has got wheels who says to tha
contrary." ' '
The suit was dismissed on motion of At
torney Hugh Aldrich, who was substitut
ed by telephone for Atorney Tappan.
Mrs. Simons friends declare that the lady
will have no difficulty in proving that she
is entitled to a divorce should she renew
her suit.
A Thieving Peddler.
OAKLAND. Aug. 6â The police believe
they have raptured a very smooth thief
in Morris Unger, alias Thomas Henncs
eey who follows the occupation of a ced
dler. He was arrested yesterday at SOB%
Center street by Detective Shorey on the
charge of stealing a bundle of laundered
clothing from Jack Massie. Shorey
searched Unger's house, and found an
other bundle of clothing belonging to one
Smith. Unger is believed to have carried
on these larcenies quite extensively, and
two charges of petty larceny were filed
against him in the Police Court to-day.
King of the "Hoboes/
OAKLAND. Aug. 6.â George Kelley.
"king of the hoboes," who has half a
tfozen aliases, was before the Police Court
yesterday, charged with vagrancy, and
on the agreement that he would plead
guilty he and his 250 pounds of avoirdu
pois was relegated to the County Jail for
thirty days. Kelley always pleads his
own case. He dresses well and works
the best houses and the food he begs
must be well cooked.
REV. F. JONES
TELLS SECRETS
His Wife Forced Him to
Leave Many Pulpits.
SAYS SHE IS A BIGAMIST
HE HEARD A LITTLE TALK
WITH A DOCTOR.
Members of the Church Kept a
Strict Watch During the
Absence of Their
Pastor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
POS Broadway, Aug. 6.
Rev Frederick V. Jones, who was yes
terday divorced from his wife Etta, tells
a sensational story of the circumstances
which induced him to have burst asunder
that which God had once joined together.
Nearly five years ago Rev. Mr. Jones
was pastor of a little church in Chicago.
He married a charming young lady and
for a few months everything was har
monious. Then he began to hear whis
perings of past incidents in his wife"s
career. These whisperings only nicreased
his confidence in his wife and caused him
to feel the more angry with those who
circulated thorn. In the end, the young
wife committed bigamy and is now living
with her second husband, although this
is the first day, according to Mr. Jones,
on which their marriage has been legal.
"I was a minister of the gospel of the
Congregational church at Mound City,
Kan.." said the minister. "This was in
the spring of 1895. I went away for a
few weeks for my health, and when I
returned I was informed that something
! was wrong. One Sunday evening a Mr.
' Simmons, president of the bank, and an
other member invited me to Mr. Sim
mons' house. They asked me if I had
heard anything of my wife's conduct dur
ing my absence. 1 told them 1 had not.
They then informed me that a certain
Dr. Coe had been Watched visiting my
house and leaving at 3 o'clock in the
morning. They told me the news was all
over town and was generally believed. I
was taken sick after that and went to
the Springs again, and while I was on
my couch directly over the parlor, I
[ heard Dr. Coe come in and tell my wife
that these people were raising a big rum
pus about them and cautioned her not to
"I left the place soon after in conse
quence of her reported misconduct, and
she went to stay with some friends in
Chicago. I wrote to her repeatedly and
received no response, and finally went to
Chicago and found har in a house that I
knew was not proper for her to live in.
I begged her to go home with me, and I
returned alone as she would not come.
She said she did not like the goody-goody
people she had to meet in church. One
week later she wrote to me that she was
sick in a Chicago hospital, and later still
1 received a telegram asking me to come
to Chicago. 1 went and found that my
wife had been attending a sirk lady who
had died, and I was informed that my
wife was intimate with the husband of
th- d'ceased woman.
"This experience determined me to give
up the ministry and find other work, I
w:is urged to return to Goodman, Kan.,
and my wife begged me to take her with
me on her promise to reform. I consented
and took her to Goodman and afterward
to Parsons. I was in charge of the First
Congregational Church there for four
years. She behaved well for two years,
â¢1 then her misconduct began again,
made it so unpleasant for me that I
igned in the community and with a
mise from her that she would follow
me and behave herself I came to Califor
nia. Here I have lived for some time
and am now engaged in business n.t Hay
wards, having quit the ministry. I have
since learned on good authority that she

MINNIE WAS
NOT KILLED
Young- Mrs. Hoover's
Tale Was a Romance.
m .
HER FATHER EXONERATED
MADE . A LITTLE COFFIN AND
PAINTED IT BLACK.
Not a Trace of Poison Was Found
in the Body of the Infant
Buried in the Back
Yard.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 6.
The little child of Mary Hoover that
was buried in a garden lot at Pleasanton
by its grandfather was not murdered.
This fact was testified to to-day by Pro
fessor George W. Colby at the inquest
held at Pleasanton over little Minnie's
remains.
The first witness was Mrs. Mary Hoo
ver, who told a very tragic story, but
toward the end she said that she had no
reason for believing the serious accusa
tions which she had published against her
father. She stated that she is not yet 18
years of age; that she is now the wife
of Henry Hoover, and that the child was
born and died before she was married.
The witness recounted in detail the
story of her father's alleged cruel- i
ties to her and her child. She repeated
that she had caused to be published a
statement charging hor father with mur
der on the ground that she believed he i
had administered poison to her infant a
short time before its death.
In answer to questions young Mrs. Hoo
ver said that she did not see her father
give her child anything and she only
thought she did. She had no proof, and
when her published statement was read
to her she said that she must have made
a mistake. She made the statement a
short time after she was married and 'â  '
admitted that she wrote it simply to get
even with her father, who had given out
an interview regarding her character.
R. H. Magill, the editor of the Pleas
anton Times, told the story of the girl
sending for him and giving him a signed
statement regarding her father which she
requested him to publish, and which ap
peared in his paper.
Henry Barnett, the father of youiff
Mrs. Hoover, then told his story for the
first time. "I make my living," said he,
"by chopping wood. I objected strongly
to my daughter's marriage to Henry
Hoover because I did not think he wns
able to support her. I had no other rea
son for. opposing the marriage. My girl
g^.ve me considerable trouble. I did not j
see her child but once alive. Her stories
that I threatened to kill it in different
ways by beating its head against a
peach tree are absolutely false. On m
occasion did I give the child any medi
cine or anything else. About an hour
before it died I went into the room where
it was and saw it with a cloth over its
face. I removed the cloth, and after a
brief look at the little one replaced it and
then my daughter told me it was very
sick. An hour afterward it died.
"We have no money and it is a hard
matter for us to live, so I could not give
the child a funeral. I did not have money j
enough to buy the little thing a coffin. I
made a neat little box with the best ma
terial I had. painted it black and burird
the infant in the corner of our iot ckse
up to the fence. I did not know it was
necessary to report a death to the Hon.lt h
Officer or 1 should have done so. Neither
did I know that it was necessary to ob
tain a permit for a burial. I did every
thing properly and decently, and hid I
been able I would have employed an un
dertaker to attend to the funeral."
Dr. W. H. Cope, to whom the child wt s
taken after being disinterred, testified
that it was impossible for him, owing to
the condition of the body, to state wheth
er it had been subjected to violence o/
not. He testified to sending portions of
it to Coroner Baldwin for the purpose
of a chemical analysis.
Professor George Colby of the ?h?mis
try department of the university testi
fied that he had examined the remains j
sent to him for any kind of poison that
it would have been possible for the child
to have taken. He found absolutely r.o
traces of any poisonous matter. He said
the fact that the body was decomposed
would have no bearing on the result, for
had poison been in the body when it was
interred ho would have been quite able
to detect it at this time. _..,. â. ,
The jury returned a verdict that Minnie
Hoover who was a little over two months
old came by her death from some un
known cause, but there was no reason to
suppose It was other than natural.

The boss of the repair department in a Massachusetts

exercise, but since I've been shut up in this shop I began
to have terrible bilious headaches. I still did enjoy an
occasional bout at boxing, but after a few lively rounds a
tendency to get as sick as can be seemed to take posses-
sion of me. ; The exercise appeared to stir up the bile and
the next day I would have a racking good headache, My
druggist recommended me o try Ripans Tabules as a
possible cure. He said they .eemed to be the latest cure-

hitches and false moves that Chairman
Dunn confessed himself considerably
annoyed.
The business before the committee
â¢was the nomination of candidates for
appointment as delegates to- the State
Convention. One hundred delegates
â¢were appointed Friday , night, one by
each member of the committee, leav-
Ing fifty-three to be appointed by the
committee acting as a body. From the
list of Democrats placed in nomination
last night these fifty-three delegates
will be selected Monday night. Aside
from frequent stoppages due to the
non-appearance of Mr. Fay, the pro
ceedings were not marked by any in
cident worthy of a Democraic gather-
WAHH PREIENT\ TUP
PROroiEO D84.6c.A-rr with'
Their. Â«CCwfMIOI(J â¢ . .
ing. As the business progressed and
the list of nominees lengthened it de
veloped that the great majority of
those who wish to receive the coveted
appointments are rt tired merchants,
retired laborers or retired capitalists.
It was suggested that by the time the
convention closes all of the delegates,
and perhaps the members of the com
mittee, will be retired politicians.
Chairman Dunn was inclined to be
lieve that it would be well to postpone
the election of the necessary'- fifty-three
delegates to a later date than Monday
in order to give the members an op
portunity of going over the list of
nominees and selecting therefrom the
names of only such men as will be sure
to represent the wishes of the peopleâ
who are appointing them. The sug
gestion did not meet with a favorable
reception and it was finally decided to
leave the nominations open until Mon
day night. This will give ample time
for those in authority to inspect and re
vise the list and add such, names as
were overlooked on account of the ab
sence of Mr. Fay.
Following are the names presented to
the committee from the varioua dis
tricts:

The Harney wing of the Democratic
party is gaining strength every day. and
in view of the rapid change of sentiment
now taking place among the Democrats
who have practically been robbed of their
suffrage by the Gouid-McNab-Alvord
combine the major and his followers are
becoming more confident that the State
convention will repudiate the action of
the trjijmvlrate. Circulars settinjr form
the details of the steal by "Whispering*
Gavin and his associates have been
mailed broadcast throughout the State
and to every delegate to the Democratic
State convention. The Harneyltes confi
dently expect that the country Demo
crats will not Indorse the scheme which
has been put up by the three dictators,
and that the Democratic party, as repre
sented by legally elected delegates, will
be given a voice* in the selection of can
dfdates for State offices.
The regular Republican County Com
mittee will meet next Thursday evening
at the headquarters in the Zinkand build

TRYING TO FORCE
EMPLOYES INTO LINE
Southern Pacific Company
Makes an Attempt to Or
ganize Political Clubs.
The political bureau of the Southern
Pacific Company has evolved a new
â¢ scheme of "doing" politics which, It
hopes, will result in the herding of sever
al thousand voters into the corporation
corral. In this and other cities of the
State an attempt is being made to or
ganize the employes of the railroad into
political clubs, the ostensible purpose be
ing the protection of the interests of the
men. The real purpose is, however, to
line the men up on the question of
"freights and fares" as associated with
the election of the next State Board of
Railroad Commissioners.
That the men are not taking kindly to
the proposition is made apparent by the
results of a recent meeting in Sacramen
to. About three hundred employes of the
railroad attended the meeting and par
ticipated in the organization up to the
point where it became necessary to pro
vide "ways and means." When it was
suggested that an assessment of 25 cents
per capita be levied more than two hun
dred of those present deserted the meet
ing in a body. The following "call," un
der which these meetings are being held,
discloses the purpose of the railroad com
pany:
PREAMBLE.
Whereas, It Is apparent to all railway em
ployes that they must use their political in
fluence for the protection of their various in
terests, therefore, we, the undersigned railway
employes of SacramentÂ© division and vicinity,
do pledge ourselves to work In unison for the
end above described, and in furtherance of
such object will form a club through which
to act, as see rules and regulations following,
viz:
Section 1. The name and title of this club
shall be "The Railway Employes' Political
Club of Sacramento, Cal.," and its purposes
and principles shall be:
1. To awaken railway employes to a sense of
their rights and responsibilities as citizens of
thelricountry.
2. To gain for them political recognition,
standing and place.
3. To, when feasible and advisable, nomln-
ate and support for office, men from among
railway employes; ottie'-wise to support for
office only those who deal juÃtly with railway
employes' rights and Interests.
4. To protect In all thlnps the interests of
railway employes, and to oppose with united
political strength all who would act, either
directly or indirectly, to the detriment of
these interests.
5. To, as far as proper consideration of the
interests of railway employes will permit,
avoid Injuring or antagonizing the Interests
of others, and to be juet and conservative in
all politics and methods.
OLYMPIC MEMBERS
REMAINED AWAY
ONLY A SMALL CROWD OF CLUB
MEN SAW THE FIGHT.
Rumors That Tracey Had Agreed to
Lose th<3 Match, and Win. Big
Money in Sets.
Tom Tracey, the victor of Friday
night's fight, was a very happy man yes
terday, notwithstanding that he shows
more marks of punishme -t on his face
than his opponent, McConnell.
Tracey said that all that his opponent
requires to put him at the head of the
welter-weight class is speed and more
experience. Tracey received as his share
of the receipts $700 and McConnell $500,
which latter sum Is considered very good
money for a loser.
Billy Kennedy, the superintendent of
the club, said last, evening that there
were 1300 people in the gymnasium, and
that of this number there were only 370
club members who witnessed the con
tests.
"Had it not been for the outsiders,"
said artful Billy, "we would have met
with a cold frost and a losing game, but
as it stands, the club cleared its skirts
and put just a few dollars away to the
good."
When asked about the peculiar betting
and why Tracey sold on the short end at
2 to 1, Kennedy replied that he had sus
pected a hippodrome somewhere, and
that before the fighters entered the ring
he gave Tracey a lecture on fake fight
ing, finishing with the ultimatum that if
he detected anything crooked neither
man would receive a cent, and that the
referee would declare all bets off.
"This had the desired effect," said Ken
nedy, "that Is, if there were any plans
laid to fool the club and the betting pub
lic."
McConnell ' s n Â°t satisfied with his de
feat. He asked Tracey for a return
match, and as the Australian will re
main on this coast for some time he may
give McConnell's prayer favorable con
sideration.
Among the people who witnessed the
fight was a woman dressed in man's
attire. President Newhall was actually
shocked when he t ieard that there was a
lady In the house, but rather than stir
up any unnecessary excitement by order
ing her expulsion he allowed the fair
creature to remain within the building
until the show was over. The lady of
morbid curiosity did not wait, however,
on the order of going when the battle
ended, but actually flew downstairs and
out of the club before McConnell had re
covered his equilibrium.
IRISH SOIL WELCOMED.
Carried Through the Streets Amid
Cheers From Natives of the
Emerald Isle.
Preceded by a band playing Irish melo
dies and a number of gayly decorated
carriages, containing leading Irish citi

BAIDED VACANT HOUSES.
Jacob Strelitz Positively Identified
by His Victims.
Jacob Strelitz. who was arrested on Fri
day by Detectives Ryan and ODea of the
Southern Station, was formally booked
for burglary last night. The prisoner Is
the man who has been entering vacant
houses and stealing automatic gas burn
ers.
A woman who lives on Page street, near
Octavia, positively identified him as the
Individual whom she had given the key
to the adjoining flat, as he pretended to
be anxious to rent it. WhiÂ»e he was in
the house she heard a peculiar noise and
on investigation discovered that he was
in the act of forcibly removing the gas
burners. He escaped from the ho.use just
as she had summoned a police officer, -t
is likely that several additional charges
will be placed against him and both Ryan
and ODea are convinced that he is the
man who has been raiding vacant houses.

The Princess stopped upon the landing three steps above the base and
shook out a tail of yellow chiffon, the sweeping skirt of a glorified boloku. The
royal yellow floated from the phoulders. clung to her youthful bust and arms,
cast its glow upward over her face and throat, fell in waves about her feet.
She looked like some dark, soit-petaled, slim-stalked lily growing in a patch
of sun. '
I ask thy pardon, holoku! I have cursed thee for a Fairy of evil, of gaudy
colors and of calico. The native woman wallows in monstrous widths of great
garish hue: the Jap loses her shrinking, Insufficient legs behind drabbling dis
mal colored folds; the half-white sports all hard white cottons that will take
and hold the starch against this melting air; and one sees all these first.
I felicitate the well-intentioned missionary who invented this garment to
teach the gentle savage'shame and had no more idea than had I of what might
be its -sweet seductions cut from shimmering stuff to cling or float about a
slender palm-like shape and make Sne mystery of youthful curves.
The Princess " carried an ancient native fan, a matter of braided palm, of
length and subtle grace, and she fanned herself slowly with that long, ma
jestic outward, upward sweep which is the grace of the higher Honolulu as it
is that of all Spain. She walked admirably, holding her supple body with, fine
reserve moving with a sort of indolent dignity, very foreign, very fetching,
and I should say, out of a slender knowledge of kingly things, very regal, and
it occurred to me that this girl who has just lost a Throne would have graced
It well. ' . ... '" -
There is much in heredity and, more in education. The Princess Kaiulani
was reared to be a queen.- She has the grand air, a small, proud nead. fine,
direct eyes under sensitive, snaky, brilliantly biack ! brows, a little haughty
nose a little bitter-sweet mouth, a crisp English accent, a manner distantly
gracious the bearing of a woman born and educated to a sense of superiority.
This ' more than the rest evolves her position , pathetic. . This is what I
wanted her to talk about. Crowns are popularly supposed to be uncomfortable,
but few queens have voluntarily changed them for an easy pillow.' I have no
doubt that the ex-heiress to the ex-kingdom of the Hawaiian Islands willlcad
a happier life as Miss Cleghorn of the United States of America, but the
change cannot be without a personal disappointment to a girl of twenty=three
â who has looked forward to the divine right to. rule over the land of her birth,
and I think of the. tragic childhood of all royalty as in the little kingdoms of
the world as In its va3t empires, loaded with the restrictions of rank, choked
in Its natural democratic impulse to be free and friendly, and all this misery
made useless by a fling of ironic destiny.
"How do they manage such things here?" I asked the Princess. "How

WHO WANTED TO BE QUEEN

to touch me except persons of my own rank and of course the servants who
dressed me, and my foster-mother. And I want to tell you something very
strange â it seems like a sort of fatality â all these servants I had are gone;
they are dead; they have died recently, quickly, one after the other and since
this trouble of ours. My foster-mother died on Saturday. I had not seen her
for three months and no one liked to tell me she was ill. You see my people
have been educated to keep all sadness aiid trouble from me." The Princess
smiled a little bitter smile.
"It is too soon to expect anything else of them. Still I should have liked
to know about my foster-mother. She died Saturday and they buried her
before I was awake. Then my man-nurse, Sam Alapai, died a little white ago.
But he was very old. He taug-ht my mother to ride, and he taught me. He
was very strict and he did not care a bit about my rank. He was a petty chief
and carried himself like a king. He made me learn to ride without a pommel.
Then without a stirrup. Then without a saddle, and I must not stir from my
seat or he would scold and scold. Actually I was afraid of him until he died.
"I found out very .early that I could be as naughty as I liked with my
nurses and I enjoyed that very much, because I was naturally naughty, I
suppose. I had one nurse that I hated and I used to love to beat ner." The
Princess smiled serenely. "But even that got tiresome after awhile. I was
the only one you know and very delicate and every one 7 etted me at home
and at the Palace, but still I was very lonely. I missed something that all
my friends who were allowed to come to play with me seemed to have. They
could not use my chair, or sit on my bed or touch me even when we played
tag in the garden. I could never be alone with them. I had always six or
seven women watching and watching mo. I was not allowed to climb the
trtfrf as they were, or to race about down to the beach, or to do any of the
things that children have to do alone among themselves without any nurses
or elders fussing about.
"I remember that I envied my friends very much and I envied the children
of the servants, who did quite as they pleased, even more. Then I can remember
a. quite new sensation which came to me when I found out that they also
envied me. That was a very delicious feeling. It served to give quite a new
taste to life and I was not lonely for a long while after that. It came about in
this way. I hud a friend, a very jolly, careless little girl, and one day when
we had been playing together we went up into my bedroom Ând she threw
herself down on my bed. I remember how my nurse ruKhed at her across tho
room, 'How dare you,' she said, and she took hold of her roughly and pulled
her to the floor. 'Sit there!' she paid, 'that id the place for you.'
"The little girl went home and I thought about it a long timo. 1 never had
seen my nurse angry and it made a great impression on me. 'Why is the floor
the place for her?' I asked, and my nurse said, 'Because.'
"That didn't seem a very good answer and then I asked, for the first time
I think, 'Why shouldn't people touch me or use my things or sit on my chair
or on my bed?'
"And my nurse said, 'Because you are a Princess ar.d the others are not.'
'Is it very nice to be a Princess?' I asked, and my nurse said that it was the
nicest thing in the world except to be a Queen, and after that, although I was
glad I was a Princess, I always wanted to be a Queen."
"Always?"
"Yes always," answered Kaiulani. "Why shouldn't I tell the truth about it?
I was mad with joy when the news of the proclamation declaring me heiress
to the kingdom reached me abroad. I said to myself like a little girl, 'Now some
day I shall be a Queen.' And meantime, after the Queen, I would come first
Jn tilfi kingdom. I tlmujrtit my heart would break when I heard that the

\ are a happy people, you knowâ very kind and

to the world, haven't they?"
The brows of the Princess Kaiulani curled
like little angry adders.
{ "Ob. they have been too kind, too simple,
\ too trusting. They have listened and be
\ lieved until they have been betrayed. Do
Jl you know what one of them, one of our old
[ chiefs said to me? He came to me over

S not take the word of any one except my

I father told him 'No. 1 'And no flag?
'No ' my father said, 'and no flag.' And then
he asked about me. Some of my people
are very fond of me. 'And the Princess?

"I Was a Princess, but Wanted to Be a Queen." At School in England.
Kalulani brought her flexible brows together over her nose and looked
away out through the wide windows down the grove of palms that were set
out to grow in the first year of her life, which tower over the roof of Aina Hau
and will fling their careless tufts to these trade winds when the house of
Kamehameha :s forgotten.
"And those who brought the influence to bear?"
"Could you feel anything but bitterness? There is nothing in our philosophy
more than in yours to reconcile us to the extinction of our race."
"You think it may mean that?"
"I know it means that," answered the Hawaiian sadly. "My people cannot
exist long under a republic. They must be led, guided, directed, ruled, and
vho will do that for them? If I had the means I would give my life to them.
I think they expected it of me, perhaps. What can I do, what can any one
without money? They will be gone from the face of the earth before they
can grasp these new conditions. It is hard to unlearn, it is the hardest thing
in the world. I have felt that so strongly as I have talked with you about my
childhood. I have to unlearn all that, you know â all that I was educated â all
that I was intended to be. They tell me I will b^much happier, it is easy for
other people â for the successful ones to prescribe h ppiness for us who have
lost. Â»
"Do you know .what I am asked? I was asxed if I would be at the Annexa
tion Ball. I looked â do you see? â looked at the one who asked me that. Then
1 said, 'Why don't you ask me if I am going to pull d wn Hawaii's flag for them?'
You know they wanted to find twelve native girls to raise the new flag. They
thought it would tre poetic. They did not find them. Is it not expected of us
to have the Aloha Aina? The missionaries did not teach us to forget that. I
am all Hawaiian. I love this country of mine. Its sky. its trees, its people.
Its food. I went to schooi in England, you knov:, and after the first excitement
I began to long for the island foodâ a longing which never passea away. When
1 came home at last I ran about like a thing mad. I looked for ail the hiving
places, I climbed to the roof of the house where I used to climb to get away
from my governess. I cried because my palms had grown beyond me. I asked
for all native thingsâ poi, taro, even tho raw fish we eat. You would think
that a girl educated in England would shrink from that at least. My Aunt, the
Queen, was delighted. She said. That's right; you are a good Hawaiian.'
"Now there will be no more good Hawaiians. We must learn to be good
Americans. I am not biiter toward America. Do not say that and do not
think that. Admiral Miller, who comes to raise your flag over vr^e. is one of

Deep Concern Over the Health of the Pope
THE uncertain state of the Pope's
health is well appreciated in
Vatican circles, and every pre
paration has been made to meet
all eventualities consequent up
on his death. While Leo XIII is not
now and never has been particularly
robust, he has always lived with such
a regard for the most exacting laws of
health which govern his own person
that he is said to practically carry his
life i:i his own hands. By this is meant
that if the Poje should lessen his care
ful watch of his own condition the con
sequences w wuld be dangerous. In his
zeal to do more than " 'Â«i strength would
allow he might undermine hie now
feeble constitution, but Pio Centra, his
personal attendant, is always on hand
to prevent this, and consequently Leo
XIII continues to astonish the world
with his great capacity for mental and
physical endurance. In the matter of
food and drink his Holiness has been
abstemious to a degree and the most
exacting principles of hygiene he has
most faithfully observed.
In consequence of his regular mode of
living, therefore, the Pope has insured
for himself a much longer period than
the years usually allotted to the aver
age human being. Those who belong
to the Pope's personal, entourage and
who see him dally do not, it is said,
look for any immediate breakdown of
his physical condition, but they do not
disguise from one another that the
tragic happenings of the present time,
the war between the United States and
Spain, and the political condition of
Italy, and Its bread riots and other so
cial upheavals, may have such an ef
fect on the Pope's health as to bring
about a collapse.
That the Pope himself realizes his
precarious condition is evidenced by
the fact that for some time past he has
been busily engaged putting hi.s house
in order for his successor. Who his
successor in the chair of St. Peter will
be is not possible for human minds to
prophesy. It is said that his Holiness,
had he the power of appointing the
next Pope, would assuredly loave the
triple tiara to Cardinal Rampolla, who
is thoroughly in sympathy with his
policy.
To guide the ecclesiastical ship of
state through the breakers of political
unrest, which seems to be the national
condition wherever the Roman Cath
olic church is the state religion, has
been Cardinal Rampolla's difficult task,
and for his great success he has earned
not only the gratitude of the holy
father but also the admiration of all
parties of his church, and also the
statesmen of the various countries of
the world. Popular though he is, how
ever. Cardinal Rampolla has a formi
dable rival in Cardinal Parocchi, one
of the most important personages in
Vatican circles. Besides being the
Vicar General of the Pope, Cardinal
Parocchi is also subdeacon of the Sa
cred College, secretary of the congre
gation of the universal inquisition,
president .of the congregation of apos
tolic visits and prefect of the congre
gation of residences of bishops. He is
besides highly learned and credited
with exercising more personal sway in
the College of Cardinals than any other
member.
Cardinal Satolli, who is bound to Leo
XIII by many personal considerations,
is also a possibility for the papacy, but
he is too new a member in the College
of Cardinals to have attained that de
gree of influence deemed essential.
It is not the purpose of the Italian
Cardinals, who are largely in the ma
jority, to allow any other than an Ital
ian being elected Pope. It has been
done, of course, but certainly not be
cause they wanted it so. If owing to
strife, policy and unforeseen circum
stances it should be found necessary to
go outside of Italy for the next Pope,
Cardinal Ledochowski, first priest of
the college and prefect of the propa
ganda, would be far in the lead.
It is said that Ledochowski, Ram
polla and Satolli have been named by
Leo XIII as his executors, and that
they are to see that his Holiness is in
terred in the Church of St.. John Late
ran in proximity to the tomb of
Innocent 111. Signor Lucchetti, the
famous Italian sculptor, is to carve the
tomb from marble from a design made
by the Pope himself.
Concerning the war it was the Pope's
most ardent wish that he should be
called upon to arbitrate between the
two countries. It is an open secret that
in order to achieve this much-desired
end he exhausted every means at his
disposal and called Into active play ihe
splendid diplcmatic machinery of the
Vatican, which Cardinal Rampolla, the
papal secretary of state, knows so well
how to manipulate. In order that the
people of this overwhelmingly Protest
ant country should not accuse the
papacy with w : anting to take too much
of an Interest in the temporal affairs
of this nation his Holiness, when he
felt the time had come to make such
representations as could most fittingly
come from him, chose as his mouth
piece, not his own personal delegate
and ecclesiastical embassador to the
church in the United States, Monsignor
Martinelli; not the primus of the Amer
ican hierarchy, Cardinal Gibbons; not
the metropolitan of the chief archdio
cese in the United States, Archbishop
Corrigan, but Archbishop Ireland, who
has the reputation of being intensely
loyal to his country and because he Js
so none the less loyal to the See Of
Rome.
To have addressed the President
through Monsignor Martlnelli on the
momentous question at issue between
this country and Spain would have
been tantamount to asking official rec
ognition for his delegate, and Leo
XIII is too highly trained a diplomat
and his advisers are too keenly accom
plished in the same art to give occasion
for such a faux pas as this. To have
used Cardinal Gibbons for this purpose
would have been equally an error, and

made him an Impossibility. But the
Pope knew his lieutenants well, and h^
knew therefore that in the wise and
courtly Archbishop of St. Paul he had
a mouthpiece who would reach the
President's ear if any one could. As
the constitution of the United States
bars out any connection between church
and state it was necessary that these
negotiations should be carried on in
such a manner so that future genera
tions might no-t say, when the whole
history of the war comes to be writ
ten, that the papacy had unduly med
dled wit i the temporal affairs of a na
tion where the church had enjoyed the
greate *t possible measure of freedom
in lta growth and expansion and im
munity from state interference.
Never did a pontiff so exert all his
energies to bring about a desired end as
did Leo XIII to bring the points at
issue between the United States and
Spain within the boundaries of arbitra
tion. Spain, whose sovereign prefixes
"most Catholic majesty" before his
name, was appealed to by all the love
and fealty of past ages to make some
concessions which would afford a start
ing point from which to commence ne
gotiations which would do away with
the stern arbitrament of war. But
Spain, which maintains diplomatic re
lations with the Vatican, was obstinate
to a degree, and puffed up with the
pride of departed gloriesâ the pride
which always goes before a fall â would
not listen to the voice of the pontifical
apostle of peace, which In the evening
of his life was made to tremble as it
never trembled before. When the aged
Pontiff found that the "vice regent of
Christ, the successor of St. Peter, the
prince of peace," could not stem the
tide which rushed madly on to battle
he cast himself at the foot of the cross
in his own little oratory and humbly
prayed to God that he might be taken
from earth before the declining days
of his pontificate should be deluged
with the mingled blood of Catholic
Spain and free America.
As if this affair between the United
States and Spain was not sufficient to
dim the sun which is setting on Leo's
reign, there must needs thrust Itself
into the arena of mqrnentous and hiÃ
tory making happenings the awful
problems of starvation of the masses
in his own dear Italy, a problem
fraught with much danger to the holy
See. Bread riots in any European coun
try inevitably give rise to much letting
of blood and shake the very founda
tions of the country, even the throne
itself.
- Leo is reckoned as a sovereign
among sovereigns, and the incumbent
of - the papal throne would not escape
the swirl of popular fury which rightly
or wrongly attributes all its misery and
want to the highest in the land. It has
been claimed that whenever, the papacy
has | exercised g| temporal I jurisdiction,
provision, adequate and far-reaching,
has always been made to guard against

any such incidents in the national life
of the papal states as bread riots. Be
this as it may, the Pope sees with much
apprehension that the discontent which
is beginning to make itself more gener
ally felt in Italy must have some effect
on the papacy, and he trembles to think
what the future may bring forth.
None knows better than Leo that
when the populace is once aroused acts
of hot-headed fanaticism are more com
mon than acts of deliberative reason.
The papacy has more man once been in
danger, and there are many who think
that the time has come, not only in
Italy's history, but also in the worlds
history, when some provision should
be made which will safeguard the besc
interests of the church and its head.
Suggestions have frequently been made
that in tin.c of great danger the Pope
should abandon Rome and seek a ref
uge in some country where his admin
istration of ecclesiastical matters could
be absolutely untrammeled.
It seems almost impossible to think
of Rome without the papacy, and yet it
is morally certain that measures have
been considered looking to the Pope's
removal from Rome in case of certain
events transpiring which would render
his remaining there unsafe to himself
and fraught with evil consequences to
the whole Vatican establishment.
Cardinal Vaughan of England Is
credited with having suggested the
Island of Malta as a safe harbor of
refuge for the Pope. How tru^ this may
be cannot be said, for these are matters
which are considered in camera and not
made public, but if it has any founda
tion in fact the question arises. Was
this suggestion made at the instigation
of the British Government, and is that
Government prepared to surround the
papacy with sufficient safeguards to
guarantee its being unmolested by pos
sible enemies? Everything seems to
point that it was. Roman Catholics are
taking a more prominent part in the
official life of Great Britain than they
have done for many years, and there is
ample evidence to show that for Great
Britain at least the days of bigotry and
intolerance In religious matters are
over.
Then see how the Vatican has fa
vored Great Britain and her colonies in
the matter of representation In the
sacred college of cardinals. Besides
England, Ireland has a cardinal, and so
has Australia and Canada. This is one
of the reasons, then, why It is thought
that should the Pope ask protection for
his own person and the Vatican estab
lishment it would be cheerfully guar
anteed by the British Government.
Another sign of the times, which may,
however, be merely incidental, is the
evident desire of both the Latin and
Anglican churches to come together on
a common platform.
Owing to the present cordiul relations
existing between the Vatican and Em
porer William It has been suggested
that Germany might be prevailed upon
to afford an asylum to the Â»apacy in
time of need, and it has even been
mentioned that the Emperor might
with becoming grace cede to the Pope
one of the small principalities of his
empire, where his holiness could ad
minister the affairs of Catholic Chris
tendom uninfluenced by either temporal
or other annoying considerations, for
be it known, should the papacy ever
change its base of operations, temporal
jurisdiction over the territory it occu
pies will be demanded. In this and all
other matters pertaining to the church
in Germany Emperor William invar
iably consults the scholarly and diplo
matic Cardinal Kopp. Bishop of Bres
lau, who enjoys the distinction of be
ing not only immensely popular at the
German court, but is also a prime fa
vorite with Leo XIII. Cardinal Kopp
is credited with having said that a very
nice way to settle the ill-feeling be
tween France and Germany would be
for the latter to cede the province of
Alsace-Lorraine to the Pope, and the
two countries conjointly guarantee its
sovereignty.
The throne of Italy is resting on the
edge of a volcano, and the signs point
to dynastic changes and the probable
overthrow of the monarchy. The Vati
can has ample means for keeping well
informed of public sentiment, and has
long anticipated the outcome. How far
the overthrow of the monarchy would
involve the papacy it is not possible to
estimate, but the Pope has taken well
into his consideration every possible
eventuality. If obliged to leave Rome
himself it has been thought that
France might again welcome him on
its soil and afford an abiding place at
Avignon, which has already been the
home of the papacy. But those who
imagine this possible do not take into
their consideration two very important
points. First, France is not now the
intensely Catholic country she once
was, and second, the French nobility,
they of the Faubourg St. Germain,
would not accord an enthusiastic wel
come to Leo XIII. Speaking through
their spiritual representative. Cardinal
Richard, they strenuously opposed the
Pope's recognition of the French re
public, and they have consequently
never forgiven him for according his
moral support to the form of govern
ment so diametrically opposed to the
so-called divine right of kings. France
is not thought of, then, seriously as a
harbor of refuge for the papacy, and
Cardinal Richard is revenged for the
manner in which his advice was passed
over.
Until the present war Spain was the
most likely place for the Pope to look
for a home in the event of Rome be
coming untenable, for by every con
sideration and tradition Spain is the
most ultra Catholic country in the
world to-day. Her sovereigns have
ever been famed for their unswerving
loyalty to the holy see, and the Pope's
advice has frequently been sought and
followed in matters pertaining to the
civil life. The Queen Regent of to
day enjoys the special protection of
Leo XIII, and his Holiness is god
father of the boy King, Alphonso XIII.
But viewed in all its aspects, Spain is
an utterly impossible home for the pa
pacy. The astute Leo would not care

to cast in his lot with a nation which
is tottering upon the very brink of ruin
and which could not afford the neces
sary guarantee of safety and protec
tion.
The only other country in Europe
which may be taken into serious con
sideration is Austria, but for some rea
son not made plain the Pope has not
been encouraged to find a haven there.
Those members of the College of Car
dinals appointed from Austria are in
every sense of the word princes of the
church and enjoy privileges not known
by ecclesiastics in any other country.
Their revenues are enormous; they live
in regal state, surrounded by all the
pomp and circumstance peculiar to
court life, and they make their influ
ence felt in the civil as well as the re
ligious life of the nation. They are in
tense partisans of royalty and sup
porters of all measures deemed neces
sary for safeguarding the prerogatives
of the crown. But, like nearly every
other country Ui Europe, Austria has
her own internal troubles, not the least
difficult of which is the want of a thor
oughly sympathetic union between
Austria and Hungary.
Whether the Pope would be allowed
to leave Rome is another phase of the
question which must not be lost sight
of. As at present constituted the Sa
cred College of Cardinals isj comprised
chiefly of Italians, who firmly believe
that it is not possible for the papacy
to exist anywhere else except in Rome.
There, in the imperial city so rich in
history and tradition, the throne of St.
Peter was established and there it
must remain. The Italian Cardinals
say the existence of the papacy is not
dependent upon the machinations or
acts of men, and they refuse to con
sider any proposition that shall remove
the papacy from the Eternal City. Car
dinal Rampolla, Papal Secretary of
State, is one of these, and so is Cardi
nal Capecelatro, Archbishop of Capua
and librarian of the Roman Catholic
church. These men are representative
of the older body of Cardinals, ultra
conservative in their views and un
swerving in their loyalty to Rome as
the ever-to-be home of the papacy.
Among the younger Cardinals who
hold this same view and one ,vho is an
acknowledged leader among them is
Cardinal Agliardi, who, although hold
ing no office, nevertheless wields a
weighty Influence.
The present state of affairs in Italy
will be watched with a great deal of
interest. If there are to be dynastic
changes, or a complete change of gov
ernment from a monarchy to a repub
lic, it is just possible â and it has al
ready been considered by Vatican
councils â that the price of papal recog
nition for the new government would
be the restoration of the papal states
to the temporal control of the popes of
Rome. It has even been said that Leo
XIII has already expressed himself as
not being opposed to a republican form
of government for Italy, but this, .ike
many other rumors, has not bain veri
fled.
It is interesting to note in the discus
sion of this topic that some years ago
a Jcs-uit priest in Boston, in addressing
an audience, _ prophesied that in leÂ«s
than fifty years the United States
would be the natural home of Catlvl'
cism. He said, in alluding to the num
ber of the church's adherents in Amer
ica, that her growth was so enormous
and phenomenal that nothing sh >rt of
a miiacle could prevent this country
being the most densely populated Ro
man Catholic country on earth. And
then, he said, Puritan Boston would be
Catholic Boston, and the Stales of
Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont,
together with the province of Quebec in
Canada, would comprise the papal
states of the new world
Whatever may the outcome jC Italy's
troubles Rome will always oe Rome,
but whether the Pope will still remain
there to wield the scepter of spiritual
authority is a problem too weighty for
preten* understanding.
Leo XIII will leave a great legacy,
not only of achievements on behalf of
humanity and his church, but alsp a
wealth of literary gems which have
never been published. It is known that
his Holiness is the author of many
pieces of the most classical Lann, and
scholars will read with grea.: avidity
the pontiff's literary work. If his end
is not far off the world, Irrespective of
creed, will pray that it may be peace
ful, for certainly he has left ih-3 world
better for having lived in it.MOST DEADLY ENEMY OF OUR SOLDIERS IN C UBA YELLOW FEVER.
THE DANGERS OF f!N EPIDEMIC THAT SHOULD SWEEP OUT OF EXISTENCE MOST OF THE AMERICAN FORCES QUARTERED AT SANTIAGO BECAME SO STRONG THAT THE OFFICERS GOT UP (\ ROUND ROBIN PETITIONING GENERAL
SHAfTER TO APPLY TO THE WAR DEPARTMENT TO REMOVE THE ARMY WHERE IT" COULD RECUPERATE ITS STRENGTH- INSIDE OF FOUR WEEKS NEARLY 5000 SOLDIERS WERE PROSTRATED WITH FEVER, AND
THE ATTACK OF THE PESTILENCE THREATENED TO WIPE OUT THE ARMY. ALL THIS OCCURRED, TOO, WHILE A WELL-EQUIPPED CORPS OF PHYSICIANS AND NURSES WERE STRUGGLING THEIR VERY BEST TO
CHECK AND OVERCOME THE FEVER.
ROUND ROBIN PETITION SENT THE WAR DEPARTMENT,
"We, the undersigned officers commanding the various brigades,
divisions, etc., of the army of occupation in Cuba, are of the unani
mous opinion that this -rmy should be at once taken out of the isl
and of Cuba and sent to some point on the rorthern seacoast of the
Un-ted States; that it can be out of danger to the p3oplÂ» of the
United States; that yellow ftver in the army at present is not epi
demic; that there are only a few sporadic cases; that the army is
â¢disabled by malarial fever to the extent that its efficiency is de
stroyed, and that it is in condition to be practically destroyed by
an epidemic of yellow fever, which is sure to come.
Signed in round robin by the division and brigade commanders of
the stricken army. Santiago de Cuba, Aug. 4, 1898.
OUR troops have triumphantly
overcome the Spaniards in and
around Santiago with compara
tively little loss of numbers, but
now they are confronted with a
new foe, a more deadly foe, that
threatens to annihilate the ranks un
less something is done immediately to
rescue them.
The new foe is yellow fever.
So dangerous is a battle with it con
nat the Government is mak
ing herculean efforts to retreat before
the pest, but already over one-fourth
the field forces about Santiago is in the
clutches of the allied fevers. To add
to their terrors the rainy season has
already set in. When it was proposed
to ;â nd our army into Cuba to reduce
trongholds of the enemy many se
rious problems confronted the War De
partment and the Strategy Board. Lit
:t'le or no doubt was felt for the ulti
mate success of our own men in driv
ing the Spanish out and causing them
t surrender and abandon a hopeless
struggle. The topography of the coun
try was well known to our command
ing officers^ The one thing that baffled
the department was to cope with and
subdue the hidden enemy. For some
time no signs of the fever were found,
but with the rain and the poor location
of the troops this most dreaded disease
one of the most prevalent in the West
Indies, made its appearance and started
in on its errand of destruction with
telling force. Every day since its ad
vent the troops have succumbed to its
effects. Among those who have taken
th- disease and passed over the great
divide- tire some of the heroes who
fought before Santiago and helped
the stars and stripes on Spanish
DOSI eS! i'IHS.
Whf-n the troops were sent South
every precaution was taken to keep
them in as perfect physical condition
..as possible, and when they were landed
in Cuba a finer and more healthy body
Qf-men would be hard to find any
where. Besides being fitted with
â¢very thing necessary to carry on a
successful campaign the department in
charge of the surgeons and nursc-s was
stocked with medical stores and ap
paratus to fight sickness, and espe
cially yellow fev< r.
Yellow fever ia not in reality a more
, destructive disease, even in places
Where it is apt to prevail, than some
others which are more familiar. It is
more mggestive of the idea of pesti
lence than almost any existent disease,
â¢ and the very name Btrikes terror. It
is not necessarily fatal. The disease !
is not alone known to Cuba and the lt< t
countries south of the t'nited States.
Our own Southern cities have been rav
aged by it. The percentage of loss cf
life, too, until reoent years in the South
was very large.
When the disease was at its height in
NeVv Orleans and Jacksonville a scorÂ«
of year% ago, some of the most noted
physicians throughout the world vi&tt
ed â¢ the plague-stricken cities and
studied it carefully. Tho cause and ef
fect with new modes of treatment were
Boon discovered, \\ith the result that it
was decided the "black frost" was not
the only thing that would successfully
kill- the germs. S'nce then new methods
have been devised for keeping the pest
within limited bounds, and drugs and
other means have bet-n discovered to
successfully cope with the disease unMl
now the scientists feel that they have
j mastered the plague and can readily
mitigate its deadly powers.
When the army started for Cuba
large quantities of the anti-yellow fever
serum, as one of the most powerful
medicines is called, were manufactured
] and sent to the front, together with
1 many improved appliances for fumiga
j tion. Besides the drugs several of the
best- known physicians who have made
: a study of the dreaded disease went
with the troops, taking with them a
corps of well trained nurp-s.
The disease has been mainly confined
to the troops in front of Santiago and
in the valleys leading to that city. The
other troops will be kept apart from
those in whom the fever has been dls-
I covered, and with the advances made
I in medical science and the skill if the
i trained nurses it is believed the disease
j can be kept within a limited space and
soon stamped out.
The medical corps has already re
moved the stricken men from the camp
pr"i"-r and placed them in the â shade
j in the dry and cool lands on the hi'ls.
j Here they are kept in strict quaran
j tine. A close inspection of the troops
is made ai short intervals, and ttiose
of the men suspected of infection are
also removed to the quarantine station.
Upon the hills and back from the
camps are placed two rows of little
white tents, above which fly not only
the flag of the nation, but the little
yellow emblem of quarantine and t'-.e
banner of the Red Cross Society, :< r
j they, too, are helping to stamp out 'he
disease.
After the bugler has sounded the si^k
call through the camp in the morning
and an inspection of the troops has
been made by the medical officers, it
is no uncommon sight to see a number
of brawny troopers, tanned by the
tropical sun and just-stained from
camp life, being carried from the camp
on litters by strong-armed men from
the army nurse corps to the little white
tented city on the hilltop. This is but
one of the familiar sights to be met
with on the road to and from camp.
Since the West Indies were discov
ered yellow fever has been known. The
men who came with Columbus were
stricken with an "unknown plague"
and died on the islands, as did many
of the followers of other Spanish ex
plorers and conquerors who in after
years visited the place. At intervals
during the past four < enturies this
plague has been master of the situa
tion in Southern countries, numbering
among its victims many thousands.
Methods to destroy it were tried with
out success until recent years, when
scientists studied it and found the
serum that has been so successful in
stamping out tho disease in our own
country, so that an epidemic in a city
of the United States is no longer re
garded as possible. This, however, is
due, in a great measure, to the im
proved sanitary conditions of the cities
and towns where at different periods
the fever ra^ed.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 7, 1898.
The following dispatches from Santiago will give an idea of the
terrific strides of fever among the troops even when the best of
army preparations are made to meet it. The dates cover a period of
two weeks and in that period the cases of fever-stricken soldiers in
one camp jumped from 200 to over 4000.
WASHINGTON, July 31.â Following are the reports posted by
the War Department on the cases of fever in camp at Santiago de
Cuba:
July 14 â Yellow fever appears among troops at Santiago.
July 25 â Four hundred cases.
July 26 â One thousand cases.
July 27 â Two thousand one hundred and thirty-eight cases.
July 28 â Three thousand seven hundred and seventy cases.
July 31 â Four thousand two hundred and seventy-four cases. 1

The last of the yellow fever epidem
ics to visit the United States was that
at New Orleans during the latter part
of last year. It not only appeared in

its way up the Mississippi River and

PRIZE MONEY IN OUR NAVY.
THERE are many inducements for
young Americans to enter the na
val service. The advantages, op
portunities and comforts, owing to
modern improvements and chang
ed conditions, make the life of officers
and seamen in these days much more in
viting than when I entered the navy,
forty-seven years ago. The man-of
war's man, as a rule, sees nearly all the
principal seaports of the world. He
soon acquires an experience of great
practical value, and especially so
should he at any time withdraw from
the navy to engage in some commercial
or professional pursuit. While the pay
is fair at all times, there comes in time
of war a remuneration in the way of
prize money and bounties that in many
cases gives a man a comfortable nest
egg, and Occasionally a small fortune.
The commanding officer of a fleet or
squadron gets one-twentieth part of all
prize money awarded to any vessel un
der his command. The commanding
officer of a division of a fleet or squad
ron on duty under the orders of the
commander in chief of each fleet or
squadron receives a sum equal to one
fifteenth of any prize money awarded
to any vessel of his division for a cap
ture made while under his command,
his part being deducted from the
moiety due the United States, if there
is such moiety, otherwise it is taken
from the amount awarded to the cap
tors; but such part shall not be in ad
dition to any share which may be due
to the commander of the division, and
which he may elect to receive as com
mander of a single ship making or as
sisting in the capture. The fleet cap
tain is given a hundredth part of all
ly infected, and matters were begin- I
ning to take a serious turn, but medi
cal men stamped out the disease before
it- got a strong foothold in the towns
along the rivers. New Orleans suffered
most. The new cases reported each day
were increasing, and the de3th list |

sons had succumbed to tne fever. It I

prize money due any vessel of the fleet
or squadron in which he is serving.
In case, however, the capture has
been made by the vessel # on board of
which he is on duty at the'time of cap
ture he shares in proportion to his pay
with the officers and men on his ship.
The commander of a single vessel gets
one-tenth of the prize money awarded
to that vessel jf it is under the com
mand of the commanding officer of a
fleet or squadron, but if it is going: in
dependently of such superior officer he
is entitled to three-twentieths. After
these deductions are made the balance
Is distributed among all other men car
ried on the books of the ship and doing
duty, including the fleet captain, in pro
portion to their respective rates of pay.
The bounties sometimes amount to a
considerable sum. A bounty Is paid to
our men for each person on board of
any war vessel belonging to an enemy
at the comnfencement of an engage
ment which is sunk or otherwise de
stroyed in that engagement by any ves
sel of the United States, or which it
may be necessary to destroy in conse
quence of injuries sustained in action.
If the enemy's vessel was of inferior
force the bounty is $100 per man of the
enemy, and $200 if it was of equal or
superior force. This money is divided
amon? the officers and crew in the
same manner as prize money.
Again, a bounty is paid to the cap
tors of any vessel of war. and which
is destroyed, under instructions, for the
public interest, but not in consequence
of injuries received in action. This
bounty is $50 for every person on board
the enemy's vessel at the time of cap
ture.- The amounts due from prize
money and bounties are judicially de
termined.
The eleven Spanish ships destroyed
at Manila carried about 2000 men. The
bounty, therefore, will amount to about
$200,000, of which Admiral Dewey gets
was during this time that the new
anti-yellow fever serum, discovered by
Dr. Guiscope Sanarelli, an Italian
scientist of some note, was experi
mented with, and what might have
been a plague greater than that of 1878
at New Orleans and some few years
later at Jacksonville was averted with
a loss of comparatively few liv^s.
one-twentieth, or $10,000, and the bal
ance goes to the other officers and men
of the fleet, according to the rules of
division, aa I have just stated them.
The statement has been made that
Dewey would receive about $150,000.
That is a mistake, as you can readily
see.
The seven Spanish ships that Samp
son's fleet destroyed at Santiago car
ried 2462 men, for whom a bounty of
$246,000 will be pajd. Admiral Samp
son's share will be $13,210, leaving $23:\
790 for 1 distribution among all the
others of the fleet. Sampson's fleet
has captured twenty-one merchantmen,
and he is entitled to one-twentieth of
the prize money, resulting therefrom.
It will be quite a large sum.
It is not likely, however, that the
war with Spain will continue long
enough for us to capture as many
prizes as we took during the War of
the Rebellion. But with the conclu
sion of the Spanish war, or perhaps be
fore it is concluded, other complications
may arise to engage our navy against
foreign foes who have a large and val
uable ocean commerce.
Some people who have not informed
themselves upon the subject believe
that the Confederate cruisers captured
more prizes than the North did.. This
is a mistaken idea, owing, no doubt, to
the extensive depredations of the
Florida, which destroyed many mer
chant vessels, the value of which
amounted, with their cargoes, to sev
eral million dollars, and to the havoc
caused by the Alabama, which took
sixty-five vessels and property valued
at $6,000,000. There were other cruis
ers â the Shenandoah, the Sumter, the
Nashv !le, the Retribution, the Talla
hassee, the Chickamauga â all of which
did much damage to our merchant ma
rine. All of these ciuisers were more
or less assisted and protected by Eng
land, and the consequence was that
the claims for damages against that
country were all bunched under the ti
tle of the Alabama Claims, and, as
everybody knows, England settled the
bill by paying $15,500,000.
The crews of the Confederate cruis
ers, although inflicting great damage
upon our commerce, received but little
personal reward for their work, as they
had no ports in which to land their
prizes, and consequently they burned
the merchant ships, appropriating from
the cargoes only such supplies as they
needed and could conveniently carry.
The Union navy, however, reaped a
rich harvest off the foreign blockade
runners, owing to the fact that the
cargoes, especially those outward
bound, consisted largely of cotton, and
very valuable, as there was a great
demand in England for that staple.
During the war there were 1129 prizes
brought in by our navy. Two hundred
and ten of these prizes were fast
steamers, nearly all carrying valuable
cargoes. There were also 355 vessels
burrted, sunk or driven on shore, or
otherwise destroyed. The value of all
the prize vessels and their cargoes was
$30,000,000. They were condemned in
amounts aggregating $28,000,000.
Among the richest prizes, as shown
by the records, were the steamers At
lanta, valued at $350.529; Alice Vivian,
$237,300; Annie, $558961; Cronstadt,
$301,940; Circassian, $352,313; Elsie, $216,

70S; Lodina. $246,651; Lady Stirling,
$509,354. The smallest prize was SI 11,
paid to a fleet of twelve vessels at Key
West. So you see the range in prizes
was from $1 11 to over half a million
dollars.
The Santiago de Cuba, a side-wheel
steamer, was the great prize-taker. Un
assisted by any other vessel she cap
tured thirteen prizes, aggregating in
value $1,404,847, one-half of which was
awarded to her. No other vessel any
where near approached this record.
The largest single share of prize
money fell to the lot of Lieutenant
Eudd, a volunteer officer in command
of the steamer Magnolia. While on his
way from New York to join Farragut's
squadron in the Gulf of Mexico he
scooped in the steamer Memphis, out
ward bound from one of the Southern
ports, laden with cotton. Strange to
say. the Memphis had been sighted by
another American war vessel, whose
commander failed to take her in. Had
he been aware of the fact that she was
the richest prize of the war, he no
doubt would have lost no time in over
hauling her. The expense of adjudica
tion amounted to 532. 551, leaving a net
result of $510,914.
The Magnolia also captured, without
assistance, the steamer Matagorda, the
net proceeds from which amounted to
$353,508. The net total of the two prizes
was $864,482.
The law of prizes provides that when
the prize vessel is of superior or equal
force to the vessel making the capture,
the entire proceeds shall be given to
the captors; but If the captured vessel
b*Â» of interior force, then the captors
shall receive one-half, the Government
taking the other half.
In the case of privateers and letters
of marque, however, the captors receive
the whole prize, unless otherwise pro
vided in the commission issued to the
vessel. Under the law, the Magnolia
was awarded one-half the prize money,
amounting to $432,241, which was ready
for distribution in November, 1563.
Lieutenant Budd's share from the
Memphis was $38,318, and from the
Matagorda, $26,517, making a total of
$64,&35.
Lieutenant Budd was a happy-go
lucky devil. Ho was brought up in the
merchant service, was every inch a
fighter and a strict disciplinarian.
While in command of a small vessel he
was ordered to Newport harbor for a
time to protect it against the raids of
some of the lighter Confederate cruis
ers that were operating along the
North Atlantic coast. One evening,
while visiting on board one of the
yachts in the harbor, he got Into some
discussion, in the course of which
uncomplimentary remarks were made
about the navy. Budd resented the re
l!t( tions oast upon the naval service,
and finally got into a fight with some
of the guests. He was badly beaten by
an overwhelming force, and was put
ashore in a boat. As the boat pulied
away from the yacht he yelled out that
he would settle with them later.
The next evening Budd armed him
self with a revolver, and with a.n armed
boat's crew went gunning for the
yachtsmen. Leading his force into the
Ocean House he created the wildest
commotion. The yachtsmen, having
been warned by a servant, hurriedly
retreated. Budd, however, marched
through the halls with his men. The
women screamed and fled either to
their rooms or out of the building. Fi
nally he ran afoul of Commodore Jef
fers, his superior officer, who ordered
him to return to his ship.
This incident occurred after the cap
ture of the two prizes by the Magnolia..
The last time I saw Budd. some years
ago, he. was living in New York and
was holding some public office.

one thousand miles to the nearest railroad station,
which was in Kansas. I wrote home to my parents in
Maine of our intended visit, and started with my wife
and child upon this long-anticipated trip. Now the
strangest part of this tale is thisâ when my folks re
cejved niy letter apprising them of our intended visit,
there was great rejoicing in the old homestead, and
every one, with the exception of father, was counting
upon the exact day of our arrival. He suddenly seem
ed to feel the conviction that something was going to
happen, and that they were rejoicing too soon; and
whenever he would hear any one of the family telling
a neighbor of our coining he would immediately say,
"They have only started, they'r not here yet." The
effect upon the others was most depressing for as the
days wore on, he became more gloomy, and this fear
ful foreboding seemed to take possession of him.
We had not proceeded five hundred miles on our
way when we encountered a terrific cloudburst, and
I lost my wife and child. Every member of our party,

EASTON, Pa., Aug. 2.â Lady
Yarde-Buller is at the Franklin
House in this city.
The story she tells of her coming
to Easton is that she went to the
Pennsylvania Railroad station in
Jersey City last Friday night, where
she was to meet her guardian and
other friends, and take a Lehigh
Valley train for the West. Their
destination was California, which
was her former home. Through
some misunderstanding, probably
on account of illness on her part,
she did not see them; they had her
money and tickets, and. thinking
they were on the train, she got
aboard. The conductor brought her
as far as Easton, where she is now
stranded. She is penniless, but the
proprietor of the hotel agreed to
give her accommodations until she
might communicate with her
friends.
On the hotel register she signed
her name as "The Hon. Leilah

bold hand. She has spent nearly all
her time in her room, where her
meals are served. "With the few peo

wh<> had the faculty of divining future events through
visions. Her earliest and most vivid experience of this
nature occurred when she was about seventeen years
of age. She was living with her parents at this time
on a farm in the famous Mohawk Valley, New York.
On this particular evening, my grandmother was en
tertaining some neighbors and sent my mother down
cellar to bring up some apples. While bending over
the bin, to put the last apple into the well-filled bas
ket, she suddenly saw a vision of her mother's bed

friends whom she had just left upstairs were stand

and climbed the stairs to find her mother merrily en

however, the very vision which she had seen in the

Civil War in 1862, while living at her home at Mount
Pleasant, she had a vision which resulted in an affair
of historical importance. She was always noted for
her magnificent horsewomanship, and on no occasion
was this daring of greater service to her than the
one of which I now relate.
One night in 18fi2 she was awakened from a very
vivid dream â so vivid, in fact, that after rubbing her
eyes, she still saw a vision of a Federal line of soldiers
marching over familiar ground. She was filled with
terror and knew that not a moment was to be lost.
She aroused the family, and ordered her s%viftest horse,
and by daybreak was on her way to warn the Con
federate soldiers under General Forrest, nearly eight
miles away. She had scarcely traveled four miles
down the pike, before the Federal, bullets whizzed by

tried to mold her according: to its p's

Paris to "finish off." Her father had
accumulated great wealth, and there
was always money with which to ac
complish her fads and foibles. To Paris
she went. To this day the pious nuns
in the convent cross themselves when
her pranks are mentioned. A merry
dance she led them, and it was witli a
sigh of relief that they returned her to
her father to take home. For a while
she was content to dazzle San Fran

I can never forget. It was
GENERAL MILLER,

simply a presentiment of death by Lieutenant Wright
of the Twelfth Infantry of Camp Gaston, California.
On the day of which I speak we had captured an In
dian chief, with a squaw and papoose, and had them
placed in a tent surrounded by four guards and a sen
try fire.
Along toward evening Lieutenant Wright came to
me and said, "I wish you would let me take that In
dian out to the tree over there and shoot him. I have
a strong conviction that he will either kill me or be
the cause of my death." Of course, I refused and
laughed at his foolish fears; but this in no way re
stored Wright to his usual happy frame of mind. And
he went to sleep that night with very grave fears.
About twelve o'clock, we were awakened by the
report of guns, and upon investigation I found that
the Indian had escaped and made his way down into
the lava beds. The next day I sent out a reconnoiter
ing expedition and Lieutenant Wright was with the
party. It was a most disastrous failure, for many of
my brave men were killed, and among them was Lieu
tenant Wright. Whether the Indian chief killed him
or not, I do not know; but that he aided in the attack
there is no doubt, as he was identified by some of the
men who escaped.

One evening just at dark, upon returning home
from a scouting expedition, he was surprised to see a
lady on horseback about two hundred yards ahead of
him for he had been told that there was no woman
within 500 miles of the camp. She wore one of those
long, old-fashioned riding-skirta that fluttered in the

less hysterical with fright, though several hours had
elapsed since the alleged visitation. The murderess
was prostrated with fear, and hopes every year that
the 15th of September will not be a rainy one, for
then she will not be bothered by her unwelcome visitor.
Since then a change of Governors has changed the
guards, and the new guards tell identically the sann
story.
When I was a little boy I remember distinctly how
I used to thrill with an uncanny pleasure at the sug
gestion of a ghost story.
We lived on a farm in
Pennsylvania, near the
Maryland line, and the
negroes, being supersti
tious, used to delight in telling stories of the "hants"
as they called them. We had one old negro woman
among them, whom we called "Aunt Phyllis." She had
been In the family for years and years. No one knew
her age, though all knew her to be over one hundred
years old. Even the negroes used to say, "Poor old
Aunt Phyllis, the good Lord done forgot to recollect to
take her home." Finally she died, and thereby hangs
my mysterious story.
My father had cultivated a habit of getting up ear
ly in the morning to build the fires, and would sit in
the kitchen until the negroes came in to prepare break
fast.
One morning having gone through the usual rou
tine, he lay down upon a bench in the kitchen and was
just settled comfortably when the door opened and
old Aunt Phyllis walked in, looked at him, walked over
to some little cupboards in the wall, opened the doors
and after carefully scrutinizing the dishes, she went
over to the stove, rattled the coals down with the
poker, took the pipe out of her pocket, lit it with a
taper and coolly began to smoke. After a little while,
she emptied her pipe and quietly passed out at the
same door she had entered. My father never could ac
count for this strange phenomenon and declared posi
tively that he was not asleep, although the family al
ways tried to make him believe that this visitation
was but a dream.

climate or something of that nature. In my dream I
was wandering by the banks of a beautiful river, near
one of the pleasantest villages of the prairies. On
the top of a knoll, nea the river bank was a cozy
home, where the grassy slope that served for a front
yard was covered with many cherry trees fuil of ripe
and luscious fruit. On the topmost rail of an old fence
stood a little brown-eyed girl whom I had known in
early childhood. She cried out in high glee when she
saw me, and welcomed me as well as her mouth filled
with cherries would permit. I ran to meet her, but as
soon as I touched her hand my dream and my sleep
were ended.
A few years later I found myself rambling about
in the self-same village of my dream. I went down by
the river and along the country road, where lay the
knoll with the cozy cottage. The cherries were ripe,
and the brown-eyed lass was sitting on the topmost
rail of the fence devouring the red ripe cherries. She
greeted me cordially, then turned to the young man
on the other side of the fence and said trippingly, oh,
so trippingly, "Charlie, I believe you have never met
Mr. Hutchinson. Mr. Hutchinson, this is my hus
band." And this was no dream.
I have never paid much attention to dreams, pro
phecies and things of that sort, but I cannot deny that
there is something in
them, for my father had
a very peculiar dream at
one time, which for occur
rence and fact were de

One night my father dreamed that he saw his
mother riding on a wagon behind some dapple gray
horses along a road familiar to him, when suddenly
the horses became frightened, ran away and threw her
out on the roadside against some rocks, where she lay
unconscious and to all appearances dead. The next
morning he told us of his dream and marked the date
down upon the wall, feeling certain that his dream was
a reality. This happened thirty years ago. and when

ally one of the first to look me up when I arrived in
the windy city; but thinking perhaps he was out or
town. I gave it no further thought, until the occasion
of my second trip back to Chicago.
One day. meeting a mutual friend of both, I asked,
"What is the matter with Chadrick?" "Chadrick," my
friend exclaimed: "Why didn't you know that he was
dead?"
"Whether I actually had seen the man s spirit or
not at that time, I do not know, as I did not ascertain
the exact date he died, and I did not calendar my
dream; but what I do know was, that his death occur
red in the same month that I had my peculiar dream.

does not dream. I haven't
time for that sort of thinsr. nor the disposition. I live
in to-day: to-morrow belongs to the dreamer. When
I was a little boy, I used to go to church every Sunday
with my mother, wh^ was a strict Presbyterian, and
prophesied to myself that when I grew a little older,
I would not go, and 'another thing, that nothing was
too great to accomplish, if I could concentrate my en
ergy in one direction. I made will-power my particu
lar "study, and perseverance my motto.
In building the railroad through Mexico, I advo
cated the employment of --exicans, and had the con
viction that they would be the best workers, if given
a fair trial. One of the strangest oppositions was that
their numerous church holidays would make progress
with their work an impossibility. Four years later, I
inquired "How are the Mexicans as workers?" and was
informed that they were not a success. "Try them
again," said I. "try them twenty years, if necessary.
f. ir they will turn out all right." My prophecy has
been fulfilled. They are now the best workmen we
have.
While I have been misunderstood by some and re
viled by many, within myself I feel the satisfaction of
a life well spent. Some day the people of California
will know me as a benefactor and friend, and I will
live to see this prophecy fulfilled.

GLORIES OF THE NEW ERA THAT IS D AWNING UPON OUR COUNTRY
AS I understand it, the United
States went into this war
against Spain in the cause of
freedom. For three years Spain
has been endeavoring to con

were Bavage. Hundreds- of thousands
yvV. r , starved. Yet the Cubans, with
"great heroism, were continuing the
.struggle. In spite of their burned

white color, vivid tints of red and
green. This is one of the finest auroral
effects, if not the finest. When one of
these crowns forms in the midst of an
already existing aurora, all the other
lights of the aurora pale, to reappear
when the crown is dissipated.
So much for the forms of the aurora.
Now as to the colors. The slow-moving
forms are white, lined with yellow,
milky and difficult to define. Rose car
mine is the next most noticeable color.
In the rapid-moving arcs, crowns,
wreaths and draperies, the center is
usually yellowish, one extremity red,
the other green. The red is almost al
ways toward the lower part and also in
the direction to which the ray moves,
while the green is above and behind.
For instance, if a ray darts down from
a crown, the lower end will be red, the
upper green. These colors will be very
brilliant; when the red is very brilliant
the green is as intense. The red re
mains longest and fades last, when fog
obliterates the aurora finally.
In high latitudes. Sir John Franklin,
McClintock, "Weypreeht and others
aver that the coloring of the aurora
was less strong when the air was very
pure and Increased when it became
foggy. The fine drapery forms are
generally seen where seas are open in
winter, free from ice, hence subject to
fogs, as in Norway, Spitzbergen and
Newfoundland.
The light from auroras is very feeble;
only a few lines of print can be read;
while by the light of the full moon this
Is easy. The intensity of the aurora
rarely exceeds the light of the moon In
her first quarter, even in the arctic
regions; this Is corroborated by Parry,
Kane, Hayes, Nordenskiold and others.
Auroras are less frequent in the full
of the moon, paling in her effulgence,
which drowns the auroral display: but
some of the brightest have been seen at
full moon. Some have said that auroras
'could be seen in daylight, but this
sounds like a ghost story.
It has been almost impossible to pho
tograph the aurora, although In the
winter of 1882-83 a Swede at Spitzberg
â ialmed to have secured a faint
image in eight minutes and a half. This
was done before access was had to the
justly robbed or savage enough to be
rightly enslaved. I think that we
should keep the islands, not for our
own sake, but for the sake of these peo
ple.
As far as the Philippines are con
cerned, T think that we should endeavor
to civilize them, and to do this we
should send teachers, not preachers.
We should not endeavor to give them
our superstition in place of Spanish su
perstition. They have had superstition
enough. They don't need churches,
they need school's. We should teach
them our arts; how to cultivate the
soil, how to manufacture the thmÂ«Â«
they need. In other words, we should
deal honestly with them and try our
best to make them a self-supportlcg
and a self-governing people. The eagle
should spread its wings over th</se is
lands for that and for no other purpose
We cannot afford to give them to other
nations or to throw fragments of in' m

not say to Russia, "You may have a
part," and to Germany, "You may have
a share," and to France, "You take
something," and so divide out these
people as thieves divide plunder. That
will never do.
There Is, moreover, a little semi.nant
mixed with this matter in my mind.
Manila Bay has been tilled with Ameri
can glory. There was won one 01 our
greatest triumphs, erne of tht- giw..Â«-.-st
naval victories of the worldâ won by
American courage and genius. We t.uii-
DOt allow any other nation to become
the owner of the stage on which thla
American drama was played. I know
that we can be of great assistance to
the inhabitants of the Philippines. I
know that we can be an unmixed bless

Spain is unfit to govern. Spain nas al

Some observers claim that the stars
scintillate less when seen through an

t'i Montigny, by the presence of fog.
On the contraryi it is clearly proved
that the scintillation increases during

to the truth as to the nature of the
they have? been victims â victims of su
perstition. Their blood has been
sucked, their energies have been wasted
and misdirected, and they excite my
sympathies. Of course, there are many
good Spaniards, good men, gc-od women.
Cervera appears to be a civilized man,
a gentleman, and I feel obliged to him
for his treatment of Hobson. The great
mass of the Spaniards, however, must
be exceedingly ignorant, and as pas
sionate as ignorant. Their so-called
leaders dare not tell them the truth
about the progress of this war. They
Sf*-m to be afraid to state the farts.
They always commence with a lie, then
change it a little, then change it a littie
more, and maybe at last tell the truth.
They never seem to dare to tell the
truth at first, if the truth is bad. They
put me in mind of the story of a man
telegraphing to a wife about the condi
tion of her husband. The first dispatch
was, "Tour husband is well, never bet
ter." The Becond was, "Your husband
is sick, but not very." The third was,
"Your husband is much worse, but we
stlil have hope.'! The fourth was, "You
may as well know the truth â we buried
your husband yesterday." That is
about the way the Spanish people get
their war news.
That is why it may be incorrect to
assume thai peace is coming quickly.
If the Spaniards were a normal people,
who acted as other fciks do, we might
prophesy a speedy peace, but nobody
has prophetic vision enough to tell what
such a people will do. In spite of all
appearances, and all our successes, and
of all sense, the war may drag on. But
j hope not, not only for >>ur sake, but
for the sake of the Spaniards them
selves. I can't help thinking of. the
poor peasants who will be killed, neith
er can I help thinking of the poor
peasants who will have to toil for many
years on the melancholy fields of Spain
to pay the costs of this war. I am
sorry for them, and I am sorry also
for the widows and orphans, and no
one will be more delighted when peace
comes.
The argument has been advanced in
the National Senate, and elsewhere,
that the Federal constitution makes no
auroral light, it is not yet clearly
known. Th^re is also as much dispute
as to whether any sound accompanies
the aurora. The northern nations be
lieve in the existence of this sound,
like the rustling of silk or of straws, a
"crackling" coinciding with the darting
of the rays. This also is not well
proved. In arctic: regions it is proba

provision for the holding of colonies or
dependencies, such as the Philippines
would be; that we can only acquire
them as territories, and eventually
must take them in as States, with their
population of mixed and Inferior races.
That is hardly an effective argument.
When this country was an infant,
still in its cradle, George Washington
gave the child some very good advice;
told him to beware of entangling alli
ances, to stay at home, and attend to
his own business. Under the circum
stances this was all very good. But
the infant has been growing, and the
republic is now one of the most pow
erful nations in the world, and yet,
from its infant days until now, good,
conservative people have been repeat
ing the advice of Washington. It was
repeated again and again when we
were talking about purchasing Louisi
ana, and many Senators and Congress
men became hysterical and predicted
the fall of the republic if that was done.
The same thing took place when we
purchased Florida, and again when we
got 1. 000,000 square miles from Mexico,
and still again when we bought Alaska.
These Ideas about violating the consti
tution and wrecking the republic were
promulgated by our great and wise
statesmen on all these previous occa
sions, but after all the constitution
seems to have borne the strain. There
Beems to be as much liberty now as
there was then, and in fact a great deal
more. Our territories have given us no
trouble, while they have greatly added
to our population and vastly increased
our wealth.
Besides this, the statesman of the
olden time, the wise men with whom
wisdom was supposed to have perished,
could not and did not imagine the im
provements that would take place after
they were gone. In their time, practi
cally speaking, it was further from
New York to Buffalo than it is now
from New York to San Francisco, and
as far as the transportation of intelli
gence is concerned San Francisco is as
near New York as it would have been
in their day had it been Just across the
Harlem River. Taking into considera
secondary; they are means to an end,
1870 the aeronaut Rolller, escaping from
besieged Paris in a balloon, landed in
Norway, and he claims to have heard
a persistent sound the whole time he
was in a certain cloud, accompanied
by a strong odor like ozone, very irri
tating to the bronchial tubes. A fine
aurora was observed at precisely that
time. Bergmann compared this odor
to that of sulphur and Trevelyan to
that of electricity (?).
As long ago as 15S0 and 1590, Tycho
Brahe observed that the appearance of
tion the railways, the telegraphs and
the telephones, this, country now, with
its area of 3,500,000 square miles, is not
as large as the thirteen original colo
nies were; that is to say, the distances
are more easily traveled and more
easily overcome. In those days it re
quired months and months to cross the
continent. Now it is the work of four
or five days.
Yet, when we came to talk about an
nexing the Hawaiian Islands, the ad
vice of George Washington was again
repeated, and the older the Senator the
fonder he was of th*3 advice. These
Senators had the idea that the consti
tution, having nothing in favor of it,
must contain something, at least in
spirit against it. Of course our fathers
had no idea of the growth ot the re
public. We have, because with us
it is a matter of experience. I don't see
that Alaska has imperiled any of the
liberties of New York. We need not
admit Alaska as a State unless it has a
population entitling it to admission,
and we are not bound to take in the
Sandwich Islands until the people are
civilized, until they are fit companions
of free men and free women. It may
be that a good many of our citizens
will go to the Sandwich Islands, and
that in a short time the people there
will be ready to be admitted as a State.
All this the constitution can stand, and
in it there is no danger of imperialism.
I believe in national growth. As a
rule the prosperous farmer wants to
buy' the land that adjoins him. and I
think a prosperous nation has the am
bition of growth. It is better to expand
than to shrivel; and, if our constitution
is too narrow to spread over the terri
tory that we have the courage to ac
quire, why we can make a broader one.
It is a very easy matter to make a con
stitution, and no human happiness, no
prosperity, no progress should be sacri
ficed for the sake of a piece of paper
with writing on it; because there is
plenty of paper and plenty of men to do
the writing, and plenty of people to say
what the writing should be. I take
more interest in people than I do in
constitutions. I regard constitutions as
an extract. I think, from Goldwln

these polar bands and halos coincided
with the presence of spots on the sun.
Klein, in our own day, comparing twen
ty-five years of observations made with
the greatest care at Cologne by Dr.
Garthe, has confirmed the fact that
these high cirrus clouds and polar
bands follow as to their frequency tne
same laws us the spo' on the sun; they
succeed each other or even coexist.
Many observers of the aurora are ot
the opinion that the appearance ot the
aurora depends on the presence ot these
clouds in the sky, which are in turn
due to magnetic disturbances of the
earth's photosphere originating in the
Bun spots. There are other evidences
that the aurora is intimately connected
with material particles in the atmos
phere, like clouds and fog; for instance
when two or more rays in an aurora
cross the light is augmented, or when
an aurora makes a fold on itself as in
drapery forms, showing that there are
two material â¢â¢thicknesses" of the sub
stance; moreover, the wind also acts
on the aurora, which is torn after a
tempest, showing that the wind has
acted upon luminous clouds which are
part of the aurora; finally, the presence
of clouds seems to favor the formation
and development of auroras. So there
is an intimate relation between them.
The rare phenomenon, St. Elmo's lire
(balls of fire alighting on ship masts
and spars) is frequent during auroras,
but this is about the only form of
electric disturbance of the atmosphere
occurring during auroras. Andree, in
18S2-S3, at Spitzbergen, with a Mascart
electrometer found that before an au
rora appeared the positive electric po
tential of the air diminished rapidly,
and even became negative, as usually
happens when it rains; but as soon as
the aurora appears the potential takes
as before a high positive value. But
it must be remembered that the electric
potential of the atmosphere, especially
at a short distance from the earth,
varies constantly in an abrupt and ir
regular manner: so that it would be im
prudent to assume any coincidence
even during an aurora.
Auroras seem to depend for then
form and position in space on the dis
tribution of magnetism on the surface
but the dear, oia consen.unr .^..wv.
men seem to regard constitutions as
ends in themselves.
I have read what ex-President Cleve
land had to say on this Important sub
ject, and I am happy to say that I en
tirely disagree with him. 80, too.l dis
agree with Senator Edmunds and with
Mr. Bryan, and with Senator Hoar, and
with all the other gentlemen who wish
to stop the growth of the republic. I
want it to grow. Sometimes I have
thought that there is only air enough
on this hemisphere to float one Hag.
and in time that dream may come true.
As to the final destiny of the isl.a.id
possessions won from Spain, my idea is
that the Philippine Islands will finally
be free, protected, it may be, for a long
tUne, by the United States. I think
Cuba will come to us for protection,
naturally, and, so far as I am con
cerned I want Cuba only when Cuba
wants us. I think Porto Rico and some
of those islands will belong permanent
ly to the United States, and I believe
Cuba will finally become a part of our
republic.
When the opponents of progress
found that they couldn't make the
American people take the back track
by holding up their hands over the con
stitution, they dragged in the Monroe
doctrine. When we concluded not to
allow Spain any longer to enslave her
colonists, or the people who had been
her colonists, in the New World, that
was a very humane and a very wise
resolve, and it was strictly in accord
with the Monroe doctrine. For the pur
pose of conquering Spain, we attacked
her fleet in Manila Bay and destroy* !
it. I cannot conceive how that action
of ours can be twisted into a violation
of the Monroe doctrine. The most that
can be said is that it is an extension of
that doctrine and that we are now say
ing to Spain, "You shall not enslave,
you shall not rob, anywhere that we
have the power to prevent it."
Having taken the Philippines, the
same humanity that dictated the dec
laration of what is called the Monroe
doctrine will force us to act there in
accordance with the spirit of that doc
trine. The other day I saw in the paper
of the globe. The appearances of au
roras coincide in the majority of cases
with magnetic disturbances on the
earth's surface. The auroral arc gen
erally has its summit near the mag
netic meridian, where the compass
needle points. The force which governs
the auroras appears to be the same
which the maenetic needle obeys. In
general, the point where the rays con
verge in auroral crowns, the center of
the crown, is near the magnetic zenith.
The variation, in fact, in such instances
is but one degree, which may be al
lowed as the amount of probable error
in observations.
The conclusion is, therefore, that the
earth's magnetic forces certainly play
the most important part in the auroral
display. The arcs or "bands" are near
ly perpendicular to the magnetic me
ridian, and the direction of the rays
parallel to the magnetic needle. The
deviations from these rules are due to
atmospheric conditions of temperature
and humidity. The electric discharges
which constitute the aurora t>>realis en
counter all sorts of conditions of the
atmospheric strata which are une.'iually
conductive; hence lack of symmetry in
the auroral display. Meteorological con
ditions very likely influence not the
production of the aurora, but its form
and position. There is an intimate re
lation, as we have already pointed out,
between the weather and these mag
netic disturbances.
The magnetic needle sometimes be
gins to be agitated an hour before the
appearance of an aurora. The mag
netic disturbances last a long while,
often for twenty-four hours. Motion
less arcs and faint auroras do not af
fect the magnetic needle sensibly, while,
during an active aurora, which is ap
parently nearer, the needle is greatly
agitated, especially when the great red
and green rays flash suddenly like
lightning.
Arago has shown that if the aurora
seems to be absent during magnetic
disturbances, it is often because it is
too distant, or below our horizon, and
visible only in more northern latitudes.
In the arctic and antarctic regions
there is small deviation of the mag
netic needle, but this is considered due
to the great height of these auroras,
while local auroras are nearer the
earth, of small extent, and due to local
disturbances.
Telluric currents, passing along tele
graphic wires, communicating with the
earth at both ends, are visibly and
often 'violently affected during an au
rora, setting electric call-bells ringing,
preventing the transmission of mes
sages b-- throwing the mechanism out
of gear, and often proving a source of
positive danger. This is not due to. or
during, a storm. The telluric currents
cease when one end of the line is iso
lated; they are only manifested in sin
gle lines which hive their return to the
earth, but they may affect submarine
cables, and they vary in direct ratio
with the length of the line.
The aurora is supposed to be a purely
terrestrial phenomenon, without regard
to outside influences.
were to bombard Cadiz we would give
up the Monroe doctrine. I do not see
the application. We are at war with
Spain and we have a right to Invade
that country, and the invasion would
have nothing whatever to do with the
Monroe doctrine. War being declared,
we have the right to do anything con
sistent with civilized warfare to gain
the victory. The bombardment of Ca
diz would have no more to do with the
Monroe doctrine than with the attrac
tion of gravitation. If by the Monroe
doctrine is meant that we have agreed
to stay in this hemisphere and to pre
vent other nations from interfering
with any people on this hemisphere,
and if it is said that, growing out of
this, is another doctrine, namely, that
we are pledged not to interfere with
any people living on thf> ther hemi
sphere, then it might be called a viola
tion of the Monroe doctrine for us to
bombard Cadiz. But such is not the
Monroe doctrine. If, we being at war
with England, she should bombard the
city of New York, or we should bom
bard some city of England, would any
body say that either nation had vio
lated the Monroe doctrine? I do not
how that doctrine is Involved,
whether we fight at sea or on the terri

has been waged absolutely in the in

of pity, of sympathy; and for that rea

BEST EMERGENCY BANDAGE: HOW TO USE IT. HOW THE NAVY DEVOURS COAL BY THE SHIPLOAD.
This Bandage Is as Useful and Helpful in the Accidents During Peace as It Is in the Casualties of War.
Any One Can Make Them and Any One Can Use Them Deftly After a Few Simple Trials.
THE most useful bandage ever devised for emergencies is known as the "Esmarck bandage." In size
and shape it adapts itself to all requirements. Its triangular form admits of its being turned
around corners an I fitted into all portions of the human body. At the same time, this shape pre
vents a surplus of material that would only serve to create heat and make the bandage
harder to handle.
The accompanying diagram is exactly one-third the size of the real bandage. The Hlustra
tions show plainly how the bandage is to be tied over certain parts of the body The treat
m> lit >'Â£ difleront wounds is as follows:
BLEEDING FROM ARTERIES.
Head â Pad ar.d bandage the wound.
Xeck â Place thumb in wound and press backward against spine.
Armpitâ Press thumb into wound; second person press main artery behind mid-

Upper and Forearmâ Press with fingers or apply tourniquet to inside of
upper arm. When bel6"W elbow place pad in hollow of bend of elbow and
bend forearm against upper arm.

HOW THE JAPAN CURRENT AFFECTS THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA
The farther north the Japan , Current -swings in
its eastward course past the Aleutian Islands _tiie
colder and dryer our winters will be.
The farther south it sweeps the raors rain we will
have and the warmer our winters. That is tha way
the matter has just been figured out by Weather Of
ficer Hammon. By comparing the weather reports
of Unga Island, off tiie Alaska coast, and the
weather repoits of California he has discovered that
the weather of California can be predicted three
months in advance by examining the weather re
ports of Unga Island. The reason, according to his
explanation, is very simple. The Japan Current af
fects the climate of Unga Island as well as Califor
nia and passes that plr.es three months before it
reaches our coast. Weather Prophet Hammon there
fore says the miners, farmers and fruit raisers
may learn three months ahead whether or not they
are . ing to have a wet or dry winter.
What. Mr. Hammon has to say on this most im
portant matter is contained in the following article:
It Costs Uncle Sam All Sorts of Fancy Prices and Sometimes It Is Handled at the Risk of Men's Lives, but
the Coal Must Be Had.
The Navy Department expects to use at least 1.000,000 tons of coal during the first year of this war, If It lasts
fo long. Last year the consumption was only 135,318 tons, costing $656,000; but the requirements are very differ
ent now, when every ship in the service is at sea, and hundreds of auxiliary cruisers and mosquito craft are be
ing utilized.
The navy has to pay all sorts of prices for coalâ from $1 90 to $18 per ton; it comes at the latter figure
in some ports of South America. At Key West, before the war began, it cost the Government $2 90 a ton;
now I'ncle Sam pays $3 50 for it at that point.
The Navy Department is now building for war purposes two steel coal piers at the Dry Tortugas,
each of them 314 feet long. It is also constructing, as rapidly as possible, two steel sheds, each of
which holds 10,000 tons of coal. These sheds are equipped with up-to-date hoisting apparatus,
whi^h is able to handle the coal in enormous quantities and with wonder
ful rapidity. Giant shovels holding two tons dive down int.) the holds of
coal-laden vessels and grab the coal, lifting it out and then running back on carriages
over a bridge and dropping the stuff into the sheds through batches In their roofs. By
the same means the coal is hoisted out of the sheds and loaded upon lighters which
when filled are towed by tugs to the warships. Then one or more ports are
opened like doors in the side of a ship, and the bluejackets carry the stun! on
board in bags and baskets. Chutes are used as far as practicable.
The work is done with amazing rapidity, the sailors swarming over the
vessel like so many bees, until at length the bunkers are ail filled. A.
deep channel runs close by the key on which the piers and sheds are
building and dredging is being done so that our men-of-war will be
able to come right up to the wharves and take fuel aboard. This will
Bave much time and labor.
The channel referred to will be lighted on both sides by electric
beacons, so. that the vessels may steam in at any hour in perfect
safety. It is not wide enough for a big ship to turn in. but the man
of-war can enter at one end and go out the other. Such deep chan
nels in the coral formation are numerous and intricate, and this is
one reason why the buccaneers of old resorted to the Tortugas,
which form the western group of keys to the southwest of Florida.
On one of them is built Fort Jefferson, an obsolete structure of ma
sonry, that cost Uncle Sam $14,000,000, and here are placed the new
piers and sheds. The name of this little archipelago signifies "tur
tles," the key being much frequented by those reptiles at laying
time. On East key a Spanish galleon laden with gold was once
wrecked, and a lighthouse keeper in the neighborhood is said to have
found $20,000 of it.
It takes a lot of coal to run a warship. The Oregon at Rio loaded
1600 tons into her bunkers. What is termed her ''normal supply" is
only 400 tons, but for a long voyage she gobbles four times that
quantity.
It naturally follows that the tempera
ture at which this vast volume of water
reaches our coast is going to have a
great deal of effect on our climate.
If this Japan current were a stable
current like a river, it would always
reach our coast at about the same tem
perature. But it is most fickle, often
sweeping 200 miles to the north or
south of its general course.
It will thus be apparent that the far
ther north the warm waters from the
equator go the colder they will get, and
as a consequence reach the Pacific
Coast colder than they would if they
took a course further to the south. As
it takes the waters of this current
about three months to get from Una
laska Island to San Francisco, it ap
pears natural to conclude that if we
know the position of the current on a
certain day we can tell in what condi
tion it will reach us three months
Traveling at the ordinary cruising rate of eleven knots an hour,
she consumes about seventy-five tons in twenty-four hours, so that
she could keep going at this speed for twenty-one days, covering in
that time 5544 knots or 6396 statute miles. . Under forced draught
she could go at a speed of nearly seventeen knots, but her fuel con
sumption would run up to 230 tons every twenty-four hours and h-'â h -'â 
coal would only last her a little over six days. Every fo'rty-thre^
tons of coal she takes aboard sinks her one inch in the water
The big cruiser New York can only carry UM tons of coal and is
able to steam thirteen knots with an expenditure of 100 tons'-a day
Going at twenty-one knots she uses more than three times that
much.
The water consumption of a big warship is Hkewico o Â».
Not less than thirty tons. or. 7500 gallons of this iniisnens^lT
are used by the Indiana every day-two-thirds of th â¢fÂ«sfÂ«. V*
the boilers and the remainder for drinking washlnl Â«qÂ« q ntity - for
The cruiser Brooklyn requires about the same amount' Â° klnsr> etc
And it must follow that if the cur
rent passes far to the south of Unalas
ka and reaches us in a warm condition
there will be heavy evaporation
and consequently cotyous rainfail.
If the current passes so far to the
north as to touch Unalaska or tTng-a
islands it is only reasonable to conr
elude that it will reach us in a cold
condition. Consequently th?re will be
little evaporation and we will have a
dry year.
Were it not for the Sierra Nevadas
the temperature of the sea would not
have such a powerful effect on the cli
mate of the Pacific Coast. As it is,
though, the mountains keep off the cold
winds from the east and leave the cli
matic conditions almost entirely to the
sea. This one fact only serves to

> EXPLOSION.
THE labor troubles of 1593 provided
'.the police with another startling
â¢mystery, which, as was only to be
iipreeted, they signally failed to un
ravel. During the greater part
"-â . â  of ;.that year the shipowners had
â¢â¢â â¢:";â  xbfSen at variance with the Coast
. . Seamen's Union over the matter
: of wages. A large number of
; non-union men, or scabs, had
/been taken on the vessels, and
jia.turally the feeling of the gen
. :uine sailors toward these intru
ders was very bitter. Quarrels
were frequent, and no good
â¢ union man lost a chance of
â hammering a scab,.
r When this feeling, however,
materialized into dynamite ex
â <'*â â¢'. plosions it was carrying mat
;'â  -'ters a little too far. Several
: : '.â 'â¢ .minor attempts were made to
V blow up the tug Ethel and Ma

..'/â : was not until September 24 that
: the great tragedy occurred. In
: Main street, near Harrison, just
opposite the Sailors' Home, was
ta boarding house kept by a man
named Curtin. This was the fa
vorite resort of non-union sail
ors, and in consequence the
place was shunned and despised
by the union men.
Shortly after midnight
George Holmes, a sail
or, with several
. . . companions, stood
chatting and laughing- in

â  .-. .noticed a small black va

tME EUGENE WARE MYSTERY.
PROBABLY one of the most famous
of the many unsolved criminal
mysteries of recent years was the
murder of Eugene Ware, a clerk
Â§in the drug store at the St.
Nicholas Hotel. The crime was
so' revolting in its character, the
:..".â  motive of the murder was so
completely shrouded in doubt,
>. .that it afforded scope for the
â  â¢ most delicate detective work. It
â - is needless to say that the police
..'â . utterly failed to gain the slight
' est hint of the murderer's iden
â  â¢ . tity, and the man who stabbed
Â- Eugene Ware with a dagger in
â¢ "nineteen different places, almost
: . barving his body to pieces, is
. â¢. still at large, unless, indeed, his
; ' sin 'has already found him out,
â  â '. and he has expiated his crime on
. - the gallows. There is a popu
â - \ lar theory that Durrant was the
â¢. murderer; one of the women
â¢ .Â«eeh about the place is said to
. have resembled Durrant's sister.
.â¢ But no tangible evidence in sup
." .port of this supposition has ever
. " been brought forward; it is only
â¢ a vague general hypothesis,
â¢ : which probably has no basis in
;'â¢ "â¢ i&ct.
- â¢-. -.It was about 1:15 on the morn
â â â¢ Ing of December 14, 1894, that
: ". 'Police Officer O'Day, patrolling
i :: m.the vicinity of the St. Nich
- " "olas, noticed that there was no
;. light in the drug store. This <r ,
'â â â â  was an unusual circumstance,
"â¢â  .' for; though the store gener
â¢ ially closed at midnight, the
."'â â¢ gas was always left burn-
ing inside. Like
an intelligent of
ficer, O'Day pro
ceeded to investi
gate. He found the
door unlocked, and the
store in some disorder, the
drawer of the cash register was
open, and drawers of herbs had
been taken from their places.
No one was there, but O'Day,
suspecting a tragedy, continued
his search. There was a Might
of stone stairs leading to the
basement, and at the foot of
these stairs, huddled up in a
gory heap, was the lifeless body
of Ware. His ghastly white
face looked appealingly
up, as if calling for
vengeance on the
murderer, in his
right hand \v;i? tight
ly clenched the key o
the cellar door. There were
gashes, evidently made with a
sharp two-edged dagger, all over
his body, nineteen wounds, any
one of which might have been
mortal, were counted.
It was of course impossible
to tell which of the wounds had
been made first. Could this have
been done some light might have
been thrown on the tragedy as
showing where the fiend attack
ed his victim.
Naturally this terrible butch
ery did not look like the work of
a reasoning man; it seemed as
if only a maniac, or one thirst
ing for an awful revenge, could
have done such a deed. Yet the
police, unable to reason beyond
the routine track of investiga
tion, assumed at first that rob
bery was the motive. As if a
mere thief would commit such
an enormity. Besides
which thvre was
nothing missing
from the place,
except, perhaps, $5
cigrar money, which might
or mi^ht not have been spent by
"Ware before he closed the store.
The victim's gold watch and
chain -were also untouched. Two
spots of blood were found at the
head of the stairs, and from this
it was deduced that the stab
bing was done upstairs, and the
body afterward bundled down
the steps.
The next idea of the police
was the revenge or jealousy
theory. Ware was known to
have many female friends, some
of whom had been seen in the
store on the night before the
murder. One, in particular, a
dork-eyed Jewess, had been no
ticed to leave the store for a few
minutes and speak to a man in
a light coat outside. The woman
was eventually found, but it was
soon seen that she had nothing
to do with the case. An unfor
tunate window cleaner, named
Frank Brown, had been seen
near the store, so the police, fol
lowing the same tactics as in the
recent Lochner case, had him
arrested and submitted him to

NELLIE HARRINGTON'S MURDER
A REMARKABLE feature about the
LA murder of Miss Nellie Harrington
was its committal in broad day
light, at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.
in an open lodging house. Yet
no one saw the murderer enter
or leave, and by a curious fatal
ity, rtfcath pealed the mouth of
ex-Senator Buck, the only man
who could have thrown light
upon the crime.
Miss Harrington was a woman
of good character, who kept a
lodging house at 1017 Ellis street.
On the morning of June 1, 1895,
she was, it is presumed, dress
ing to go out, but she never l^ft
the door of her house alive. Soon
after 1 o'clock, the inmates of
the building noticed a smell of
fire, and the battered corpse of
Miss Harrington was found
burning in her room. The mur
derer, not content with beating
the woman's skull in with some
blunt weapon, had soaked her
body with coal oil and set fire to
it, hoping, doubtless, that the
blaze would cover up all traces
of his awful deed. But the fire
was extinguished before it had
time to spread, and the police
were left with a difficult piece
of work before them.
The task was one which might
well have puzzled skilled detec
tives, let alone Lees and his sub
ordinates. The motive was evi
dently not robbery, for nothing
of value, except a watch, had
been taken from the room. The
murdered woman had apparent
ly expected some such fate, for
she had left two wills, disposing
of her property in the event of
anything happening to her. The
weapon with which the murder
was committed was never found.
As usual the police started on
a wrong scent. Lees got hold of
an unfortunate Jan, who had
taken a room in Miss Harring
ton's house. This man, a harm

less creature, had had his face
burned some time before with
chemicals, and the Chief thought
this a conclusive proof and held
the Jap in custody. But noth
ing whatever turned up to con
nect the Japanese with the trag
edy.
Then it leaked out that Miss
Harrington had a great friend,
an elderly gentleman, who used
frequently to call and take her
out Cor a ride in his buggy.
Strangely enough no one could
ever be found to assert posi
tively that a buggy was or was
not standing- outside the door at
the time of the murder. No one
had seen the conveyance, but at
the same time no one would
swear that it was not there.
Then it was discovered that
Miss Harrington's friend was
ex-Senator Buck.
Here is where the strange sec
ond fatality of this tragedy
comes In. The Senator, on the
same day. was thrown from his
buggy > n Oakland, and received
injuries which resulted in his
death a few days later. He
never regained consciousness af
ter his accident, and conse
quently was unable to throw
any light on the murder.

MORTON -STREET STRANGLER.
DURING the early months of 1596
there was a regular reign of ter
ror among the denizens of Morton
street and its vicinity. The scarlet
woman for the time being was
scared from the pursuit of her
ancient and dishonorable pro
fession. The police proved ut
terly powerless to protect her,
nor was any trace of the mur
derers ever discovered. Owing
to the secrecy with which her
trade is conducted the "unfor
tunate" offers herself as an
easy prey to the midnight mur
derer. History relates many
such instances. Jack the Rip
per terrorized Whitechapel with
his butcher knife, but no trace
of the man was ever found. The
Denver strangler killed three
French and one Japanese
woman in 1894, but his identity
was never disclosed. Indeed,
when little May Smith or Ma
mie McDermott was found
strangled on the early morning
of February 10, 1896, there were
many whose first words were,
"The Denver strangler has come
to San Francisco."
In February and March,
1896, however, Morton street got
a thorough scare. Little May
Smith was a beautiful girl, only
20 years of age. Her rooms ad
joined a saloon, so that there
were two entrances,
one through the
saloon and one
â  from the
street. It was no
*^ body's business in par
ticular to note who entered
or left her apartments. The
murderer, whoever he was,
had every opportunity to
work in secret. It was only
when the rent collector called
for the pitiful dole which vice
pays to capital that the unfor
tunate girl was discovered dead,
the marks of human fingers on
her throat showing how the foul
deed had been perpetrated.
The police put a close patrol
on the street, and all sorts of
foolish tales floated around.
Among other stories was one of
a jealous woman who had
horsewhipped a man on Morton
street that night, and who had
vowed vengeance against the
inmate of one of the dens of
vice. The police examined and
cross-examined everybody they
could think of, but they
**- never got any near
er the mys-
tery. The ex
citement caused by
this crime had hardly
subsided when a month later an
other and more awful murder
occurred. In this case the vic
tim was Bertha Paradis. who
lived at 27 St. Marys street. At
2 o'clock on the morning of
March 10 her parasite, a
Frenchman named Caesar Che
bart, found her dead in her
rooms. A large handkerchief
had been literally rammed down
her throat with the aid of a car
penter's pencil. No money had
been taken from the room, and,
indeed, she had little to lose.
There was not the faintest
trace of the criminal. Her sou
teneur was obviously the last
man to have committed such an
offense, and no one knew who
had visited her during the even
ing. All this occurred right un
der the shadow of St. Mary's
Cathedral, where in those days
vice used to hold its own un
checked. The police were pow
erless, the Coroner's jury re
turned the customary verdict
of murderer unknown and the
curtain fell on the last act of
the dual tragedy.

or even murder, can be committed
in the outlying parts of San Fran

The men were taking a final
glass preparatory to turning in
for the night, when a mysterious
looking stranger, wearing a
slouch hat, entered. He called
for a glass of beer, looked about
him as if sizing up the place
and departed.
A little later, when the grocer,
Eichorst, was about to close his
store, the man again returned,
accompanied by an equally vil
lainous companion, all the other
customers, save Neville, having
departed. The robbers held up
Eichorst with their revolvers,
but he was too quick for them.
Diving beneath the counter he
slipped out through a back door.
No one, except the murderer,
saw how Neville met his death,
but it is supposed that the rob
ber was about to shoot the es
caping grocer when Neville
seized the weapon and received
the charge intended for his
friend.
The difficulty of governing
Mongolians by laws specially
framed for Caucasians has long
been apparent. Within the
limits of Chinatown our elabo
rately organized police force is
practically powerless.
Thus, because the See Yup So
ciety happened to be at variance
with the Sam Yup, one of the
most famous characters of
Chinatown, Little Pete, was shot
early in 1597. Little Pete was
wealthy and influential; for
years he had been at the head
v.?^? ry scheme and corruption
which originated in Chinatown.
,]\l his dealings with white
political bosses were notorious.
There were many reasons why
the See Yup Society should de
sire to get rid of their formid
able enemy, the head of the Sam
Yups.
Rather than be annihilated
the See Yups put a high price on
Little Pete's head.
A still more recent case, the
details of which are still fresh
in the public mind, was the
murder of Isaac Hoffman, a
wealthy merchant, the senior
Â£ ar Â»l ne J*-,!T the firm of Hoffman.
Rothchild & Co. His murder iri
his own office, at the close of a
busy day's work, seems like a
page taken from a detective ro
mance.
Captain Lees' conduct in this
case was in strong contrast to
his treatment of the recent
Carpenter mystery. Hoffman's
relatives employed private de
tectives and strove to bring 1 the
crime home to Figel. But Figel.
unlike Lochner, was a man of
influence and position, and Lees
absolutely declined to do any
thing so outrageous as to arrest
a man on bare suspicion. When
Attorney Ach demanded Figel's
arrest Lees explained to a re
porter: "If Mr. Ach or anybody
else wants anybody arrested
there is a simple way to accom
plish it. Let them swear to a
complaint and secure a war
rant."
However, despite the fact that
the Coroner's jury declined to
specify by whom the murder
was committed. Figel was
eventually arrested, but the evi
dence produced at his trial was
totally insufficient to convict
and he was acquitted.
Another case in which the po
lice raised the futile suicide
theory occurred on the first
day of the present year. J.
H. Dow, who kept a
shooting gallery on
Kearny street, on the
Barbary Coast, was
found dead in his es
tablishment Three
small bullets, fir
ed from a 22
caliber single
barrelled pistol,
such as are com
monly used for
practice in these
had struck his head.
The Coroner, after an
autopsy, said it was
clearly murder, but Lees
stuck to his suicide theory.

gems in a bit of dirty rag and stuffed this into the toe or a

and a change and went for a walk down town.
On his way along Stockdale street he chanced to meet
a well-dressed, dapper-looking little man, who nodded to
him as one might do to a casual acquaintance, and said In
a quick, chirpy sort of tone:
: "How do Ridley? S n af.i/' rO he vSll. 1 . Sitt. a <,u,ck

man with whom young Ridley had thus fallen into con

Muratti The wider world knows him now as Michael Mu
ratti Bsa L a., and director of many important flnan
' cir.l undertakings. But in those days he was just an ex
tremely clever man, a Jew of reputed Florentine ancestry,
but more recent and authentic East End extraction, who
had made his debut in Kimberly as a dealer in cheap iew
elrv and slop-made tfitsâ after havini wandered about
picking up a living by the display of his Juggling anilities
âand who was now looked upon as one of the smartest
'.and nlost successful "operators" on the diamond fields.

parcel away with me instead of my own, what's that to
anybody but you or me?". .
It wasn't altogether a new device, but It worked, and
In the result Mr. Muratti's valuation of the boots was so
far satisfactory that about two hours later Frank Ridley
went home with a check for Â£2500 and an T O U for a like
abount in his pocket, and a pair of another man's boots
under his nrm, neatly wrapped up in a eupy of tile Dia
mond Fields Independent. The check wns on Lloyd's
Bank, London, amd was payable, not to Frank Ridley, but
to Miss Alice Ransome. The IOU was personal, but both
â¢went to England by the next mall.
There occurs here the unpleasant necessity or adding
that the check was stopped by cable lonar before Miss
Ransome had any chance of presenting it. The fate of the
IOU was to be determined later on. Meanwhile Mr.
Frank Ridley's thoughts turned homeward â¢ and mingled
with loving memories and fond anticipations.
That same night, between 11 and 12, Mr. Muratti had a
visit from a man of his own people, a youth of some 21
summers, whope life had so far been mostly winter. Not

THE HESSIAN FLY'S DEADLY , WORK IN OUR GRAIN FIELDS.
THE most deadly fne for grain I
fields is the Hessian fly. The
last ten years or so have se^n ;
England invaded by this foreign 1
foe, but for more than a cen
tury he had already been a great
scourge in America, where he first
acquired the name of Hessian fly dur
ing the Revolutionary War, through j
the popular belief that he had been im
ported from Europe into Pennsylvania i
by the Hessian troops employed as j
mercenaries of George 111 in his fruit
less struggle against the revolted colo
nies. Thp Yankee farmers, finding their
crops devastated by a p->st till then un
known, came at once to the conclusion
that their enemy, King George, had
sent the two plagues, human and en
tomological, over sea together.
One school of disputants claim the
Hessian fly is a native of the Old \
World, and that its first home coincided j
araln and again that rising financier had, with the tra
ditional generosity of his people to their kindred, meta
phorically taken him out of the gutter and set him on his
feet on the pavement. The subject of their interview that
particular night was closely akin to this species of rescue
work. No one else was present, and Mr. Muratti bpoke
plainly and to the point.
"It iust comes to this., Jossey, he said, toward the end
of the discussion, "you'll never be any good to yourself or
any credit to your relations as long as you go sloshing
around in this good-for-nothing way of yours. Now here 8
a good solid chance for you. Do as I tell you, man. Own
up and play the greeney. You won't get more than five
years as a first offender, and if you behave yourself you 11
get out with three. I know the ropes down yonder; don t
you fear, and I'll pull 'em hard for you. Then when you
come out there's five thousand for you in solid cash and a
thousand a year for live years after that. Now, Jossey,
what do you say to that?"
"What do you want me to be trapped at all for?' the
tempted Joshua objected rather sulkily. "If you've got the
gonfvahs, why don't you plant 'em somewhere safe and
run 'em down when you get a chance, like the others do?"
"Because I don't do business like the others," replied
Mickey with an air of conscious pride, "and because I'm
playing a deeper game and for a bigger stake. It's this
way, you see. Ridley and me were shadowed wl>le we
were talking in Stockdale street. He didn't see it. but I
did, and that's what made me think of this lay. We
were shadowed again at Tooley s, and I was followed
home here by one of the smouches.
"Now, Lipinzki's no fool, and neither i? Fox, nor Ixnve,
nor any of them. What do I want talking to Ridley for
just after he's come out of the sorting room? What do I

one who goes out of camp, any one belonging to

hard for its. being an aboriginal inhab

at least, is certain, that at the present

produced by this insignificant little
creatuie, indeed, has in some seasons

dollars.
If you go out into a barley-field in
England where the Hessian fly tas ef

find a large number of plants of barley,

fallen by their own weight; but if you
examine them closely In the neighbor
hood of the bend, which occurs with
singular unanimity in all the affected
plants at about the same point, you
will find inside the sheath of the blade,
v. here it encircles the stem, a curious
little body which the farmers with
rough eloquence have agreed to de
scribe as a "flax-seed." If you watch
the development of the "flax-seed,"
again, you will find that it is not a seed
at all, but the pupa-case (or rather the
grub-shell) of a small winged insect;
and it is the life-history of this insect,
the Hessian fly, that I now propose to
sketch for you in brief outline.
The mother fly in nature Is but a
small black gnat, belonging to the same
group as our old friend, the mosquito.
You will observe that she is a fairy
like creature, for all her wickedness:
she has two delicately fringed wings

Nearly five years later Michael Muratti Esq was sit

dence in Lancaster Gate. He was reading a letter and
swearing softly under his breath at every line of it. When
ne had read it through for the second time he crushed it
ud in his hand and .stuffed it into his trousers pocket, went
"ml stood on the hearthrug with his short sturdy legs
wide apart, and said to a life-sized portrait of nlmself
which hung in the middle of the opposite Trail: _ .

another thousand apiece for old times' sake, and that s
the loi Hi If a million apiece, whew! Why don't tney ask
for the wholÂ« caboodle at once? I'll see them selling fried
ftsh first."
The explanation of this resolution may|be briefly given
as follows: Thanks to â¢ semplary behavior and a certain
amount of Judlciou ily applied influence, Mr. Muratti's
had got off With a little over three years. The
day he came out he received the welcome mit not unex
pected Intelligence that, through the death of a relative in
London he had come into b X) ready cash, and prop
,,<\ securities yielding about another thousand a

The same evening he renewed the acquaintance of
Prank Ridley, who had been discharged without any as
signed reason a few we< Its after th< greal coup which had
proved 90 worthless to him. The bank had been advised
by cable that a leaf bad been stolen out of Mr. Muratti's
London check book, and cautioned not to easn any checks
without further notice. Hence, the first JJ2SUO n;ui not been

She Hies about on the stubbles In Sep

sown barley plants and on the after
growth of the cut crops; as well as in
spring (a second brood) on the new
sproutingr barley.
The eggs are extremely minute, and
are pale orange in color, with reddish
dots. Most of them are deposited on
the leaf itself, or on the sheath or tube
which forms its lower portion.
She lays her eggs wii.n the head end
downward, and as soon as the tiny
grub hatches, which it does about the
fourth day, it emerges from the snel'
and walks straight down toward the
stem, at the point where the protecting
leaf sheaf is wrapped closely round it.

nothing without disclosing the whole transaction, and that
would mean not less that ten years on the breakwater for
him, and so he grinned and bore it, and waited till Josgey
Meanwhile Mr. Muratti grew and flourished exceeding
ly. Everything he touched turned either to gold or dia
mondsâthough he never touched anything illicit after th*
dSt He S was a quite a great man. now, but. as every on*
knows him there is no need to repeat that, and there was
not a cloud on his financial or social horizon save his con
nection with Jossey and the present impossibility of get
ting introduced to the Prince of Wales.
He had given Ridley a couple of thousand in cash on
Jossey's strong representation, and fondly thought that
would settle his unprovable claim for pood, but that was
Just where he had made the biggest mistake of his life.
Jossey came out of penal servitude a very different person
to the shiftless ne'er-do-weel that he was wnen he entered
It. It had done him a lot of good. It had put backbone
into him, and. besides, he had learned many things that ne
wotted not of before. . Â ,
After more than three years of penal toil and disci
pline, embittered by deprivation of all creature comforts,
it was only in the course of nature when he regained his
freedom and found himpeif in command of plenty of money
he should be strongly inclined to compensate himself for
his vicarious sufferings on a somewhat liberal scale.
It was in this humor that Ridley had found him. He
had made a little money, more or less honestly, since his
discharge, and so there was no suggestion of sponging.
But he was very sore Still about the check and the IOU,
and in Jossey he thought he saw the means of getting
square with the millionaire who had done him such an
unscrupulous "shot in the eye."
To this end he worked both skillfully and successfully
on the ex-eonviet's feelings until he came to look upon
himself as a martyr and Michael Muratti as a monster of
ingratitude. What were a few paltry thousands to the
millions that were literally rolling inâ the millions that
would never have been his if he, Joshua, had not bornÂ©
the penalty of his crime? He had the plainest right to a
good substantial share of them, and so. too, for the matter
of that, had the man from whom Mickey had so dishon
estly obtained the stones on which his new fortunes had
been founded.
As time wentson these arguments werr very strongly
enforced by the fnct that the aforesaid "paltry tnousands *
did not go "very far when Mr. Joshua Mosenstein had once
learned the joys of spending money with the cheerful free
dom that is born of a sure and certain hope that when it
is done there will be plenty more forthcoming. The logical
result was that these two worthies, now rast friends in a
common object, had made demand after demand on the
apparently bottomless purse of the multi-millionaire, un
til at last a certain fact had come to their knowledge
which, after due deliberation together, had Inspired them
to write the joint letter that had so disturDed Mr. Murat
ti's equanimity.
They traveled home by the same mailboat which car
ried their Utter, and on the morning following its delivery
they paid a visit to the millionaire at his West End man
sion. The Interview was not exactly a friendly one. Mr.
Muratti blustered, and his visitors qui^tiy but firmly
doubled their already exorbitant demands.
The man of millions threatened to have them put Into
the street, and broadly hinted at the advisability of giving
them into custody n.Â« r>lackmailers. That brought matters
to a head in a somewhat dramatic fashion. Tn,e ex-sorter
t"i>k out hi* pocket book and produced from it a half Kheet
of note paper, on which was pasted a short newspaper cut
ting, lie handed it to the millionaire and said:
"That's from the Cape Times, Mr. Muratti. Do you
think you could throw any- light on the sunject? I have
an idea that you could, especially with our assistance. De
Beers would give a good deal to know how that stone got
away. I believe they would even accept me as queen's
evidence to get the mystery cleared up. What do you
think?"
With slowly widening eyes and sinking heart, the man
of many millions, and more ambitions, read the cutting.
It ran thu^:
Tho King of the Belgians has just indulged in
his well-known taste for gems by the addition to
his already priceless collection of a magnificent
rose-colored diamond, weighing nearly tnirty carats

paid the enormous price of a thousand pounds a
carat to the Amsterdam merchant of whom he
bought it. In c>lor and water it is the exact coun
terpart of the famous rose diamond in the De Beers
collection, but it Is much larger.
Its origin Is involved in some little mystery. The
merchants from whom his Majesty ptireha-efl it
affirm that the dealer from whom they bought it

then the young grub stops, wedged
tightly in between the leaf sheaf and
the stem, and with its head pointing
downward. Being a hungry, and there
fore an industrio-up. creature, it at once
gets to work to eat the barley plant.
How much damage this action does
to the crop you can best understand
by a glance at the two contrasted Il
lustrations. Look on the "seven well
favored ears" of barley, unaffected by
Hessian fly, and with the grains richly
filled out, as the farmer desires theni.
Then notice the "seven lean ears," at
tacked by the fly. You will observe,
by the way, that I speak throughout of
barley, not of wheat. This is because
in England, where these sketches arc
studied,, the time of wheat sowing is
such that the wheat has so far escaped
the pestâ the female flies are all deid
before the crop has sprouted â whereas
in America the "fall wheat" comes up
at the exact moment when the female
Hessian fly is abroad and scouring the
fields In search of plants on which to
lay the eggs of her future generations.
In England, therefore, it ia barley alone
which is largely attacked; and sinca
barley is mainly used for malting, to
make beer or whisky, the teetotaler
may perhaps reflect with complao?ncv
that the fly is merely playing the game
of the United Kingdom Temperance Al
liance.
The grub eats and eats, in his safe
cradle between the sheath and the
stem, till he is ready to pass into the
adult condition.
The succeeding illustrations show the <
successive stages through which it*
passes before complete emancipation.
It is a curious fart, however, that in
spite of all the apparent pains be
stowed upon securing the perpetuation
of such destructive creatures as the
Hessian fly. the pest itself has its own
enemies, as fatal to its life as it is to
the barley. Ichneumon flies and other
parasites prey by millions on the Hes
sian fly in its grub condition; and
many good authorities believe that the
safest wÂ»v of checking the depreda
tions of the barley-plague is by en
couraging the multiplication of its nat
ural enemies.RAISING PEARLY TO SELL

For years the inventors of these im
proved war Implements have vainly
bombarded the government at Wash
ington. The objections against Ameri
can devices were thicker than Spanish
barnacles at Santiago.
Hiram Maxim, an American, born in
Maine, was forced to sell his famous

governments Spain bought a lot of
them.
Twenty years ago the "barbaric"

apart unless they are placed side by
side.
It is also said that pearl divers about
Ceylon have a habit of inducing pearl
growth in this same manner, although
it is a dangerous industry.
Only a diver of the most expert kind
dare attempt it. These men have cer
tain outward signs by which they can
make a good guess as to the pearl
producing quality of oysters. They
claim that oysters with very rough
shells, having a certain kind of
"whorl" to the grain of the shell are
capable of producing the best pearls
and the largest.
Of course a perfectly appearing oy
ster may not contain any pearls, and
if it is once removed from ita clinging
place on the rock all hope for the fu
ture is destroyed. In order to be
sure of a pearl the pearl diver inserts
I a grain of sand between the shell and
the mantle and then waits for it to
, grow.
But the act of inserting the grain of
1 sand is not quite as simple as might
: appear. There are several reasons for
; this, the principal one being that the
| oyster is likely to keep closed as lons
jas there is anything unusual going
on.
To overcome this it Is necessary for
the diver to watch his chance. This
' means that he must stay near the oy
ster as long as his breath will permit
: him and wait for it to open its shell.
! This may not happen in a hundred
i trips to the bottom, and it may hap
; pen the first time the diver sees tha
oyster.
When the diver does find the shell
open he quickly inserts the plug and
! then goes to the top for a breath of
1 air. His next work is to insert the
; grain of pand. which is done with a
, pair of tweezers. The piug is then
withdrawn and the oyster left to de
velop the pearl.
After this is done the diver devotes
his efforts to watching that particular
| pearl oyster. He makes it a business
smokeless powder, even going so far as to purchase a supply abroad.
"Although the Army Ordnance Bureau has a reserve supply of fifty thousand
Krag-Jorgensen rifles, It Is not proposed to place- thtun in iht* hands of the vol

ure for war use. The Inventor was
driven out of business. A few years
later an "Improved" half breed, alleg
ed smokeless powder, tho product not
of the original inventor, but of a Gov
ernment powder sharp, was proclaimed
excellent for small guns, and it was
hoped that it would be soon adopted
for cannon.
This explains why the United States
had non. when the war burst upon the
country. Spain was well provided with
the porder that Washington experts
had declared a failure.
Hudson Maxim, inventor of smoke
less powder, and formerly associated
with his brother Hiram, the gun inven
tor, said to a Call correspondent yes
terday:
"I sent Sampson some smokeless
powder several years ago. It lay at
Indian Head, and he would not use it
because he said it contained nine per
cent nitro-glycerlne. But the navy is
now using cordite on the New Orleans
which contaii.r ~o per cent of nitro-gly
cerine.
."'The Spaniards have used smokeless
powder with terrible effect. When our
ships opened on the forts they fired a
while and then had to retire for the
smoke to clear away."
The cost of our war with Spain above
what it would have been had we been
prepared is difficult even of approxima
tion. I doubt if there would have been
war had Spain believed we were ready.
Spain and other European countries
thought she would have the best of the
fight for a time. The world has been
to see that nobody else finds it. ThiÂ»
is done by covering It â¢with sea weed
and keeping it from sight as much as
possible. His next work is to keep it
supplied with food. He hangs what
he thinks the oyster will like just in
front of it, so that when it opens its
shell the food will almost fall into It.
Scientists declare the oyster does not
eat this stuff, but the pearl diver holds
a different opinion.
And when the period for the pearl's
development is up the pearl diver
breaks the oyster from the rock, takes
it to the surface and breaks it open.
Perhaps he may be disappointed, per
haps he has a fortune. There arÂ«
Innumerable instances to prove both
cases.
It Is authenticated that a pearl
diver at Ceylon, after "fixing" an oy
ster, found on breaking it open that
it contained two other pearls, larger
than the one he had given so much
time to developing. All were magni
ficent gems and the diver spent the rest
of his days in luxury'- A diver who
has failed in this feat seldom tries it
a second time.
There is no reason why pearls should
not be artificially induced in the oy
sters that are found along the Pacific
Coast. Some of those from Mexico
have yielded splendid pearls and occa
sionally one is found in the vicinity
of San Diego.
While the oysters from San Francisco
Bay occasionally yield small pearls it
is next to impossible to induce them
by artificial means. It has been tried
frequently and has always resulted in
disappointment. The cause for this is i
the water, which is neither salt nor j
fresh. Wind and tide cause the water
of fhe bay to constantly change, so j
that one day it may be nearly all salt ,
and the next day nearly all fresh. Or
dlnarily it is a mixture of both. This
of course prevents an even deposit of
lime so that it cracks and peals and j
eventually becomes only a ridge on the
shell.

FREE OYSTER BEDS
ON THE ALAMEDA SHORE
They Were Accidentally Discovered by a Small Boy Hunting for Clams, and Now Hundreds of People Are
Grappling There for Oysters.
AMONG many other blessings
California ran now boast of a
public oyster bed. Absolutely
free to everybody. Go over
and help yourself. You -will
find the bivalves as fine as any
you ever tasted and be perfectly sure
that they are fresh.
This oyster bed is about two or three
miles below Bay Farm Island on the
Alameda shore. There are two ways
of reaching It. One Is to take a boat
and row around Bay Farm Island; the
other is to cross the creek in Alameda,
walk down the road a few hundred
feet and then cut over the marsh to
the bay shore.
There will be no trouble about find
ing the place, provided you get there
at low tide, for the surface of the
water will be covered with people, all
bent on obtaining the luscious shell
fish from Its resting place on the bot
tom of the bay.
The existence of this oyster bed has
only been known for about two weeks
and during that interval It has been
most liberally patronized. It was "dis
covered" by a small boy who went out
in that direction to dig clams. It so
happened that he was sent out on the
day of the big low tide and consequent
ly could go farther from shore than
usual.
Of course he found plenty of clams
and then wandered far out in search
of larger ones. In a pool about twelve
inches deep he unexpectedly spied a
"bunch" of shells. At first he thought
they were clams and proceeded to raise
them. On succeeding in this he was
more surprised to find that they were
oysters and of a good size.

ing Its repetition impossible. Blame
cannot be brought against the inventor.
At least 75 per cent of all the inven
tions in guns and ammunition, war ves
sels and fortifications, high explosives,
ttfrpedoes and gunpowder now used by
the best-equipped nations have been in
vented by Americans. The struggles of
inventors with the Government to get
recognition are part of the country's
history.
"Had Congress or the War and Navy
departments fully appreciated the ex
tent to which American improvements
are being utilized by other nations the
necessary appropriations could have
doubtless been secured to keep our in
ventions at home. There is something
radically wrong when a country which
leads the world In the number and
value of its inventions should be the
slowest in accepting them. The most
notable of all devices which have revo
lutionized warfare are American inven
tions. As a rule they have been driven
to foreign governments and developed
in foreign hands before being accepted
at home.
"The vast sums recently squandered
for anything and everything in the
shape of vessels, arms and equipments
for war are but a price paid for inex
cusable neglect.
"This is a subject for the serious con
sideration of every taxpayer. The navy
is the property of the people. The peo
ple pay for it and should have the be3t

"The Holland submarine boat has
demonstrated all that is claimed for it.
It has shown itself capable of ap
proaching unseen and striking a death
blow to any battleship afloat. Why
should not Holland boats, instead of
battleships, be built? This invention
still rests on the anxious seat, where
other Inventions have rested until
bought by Europe. There is now -io

"There is something radically wrong
i somewhere. Congress should create a
board or commission, with new and
sufficient powers, made up of the most
progressive men of the army and navy,
and of civilians of the necessary knowl
edge of mechanics, electricity, metal
lurgy, chemistry, etc. Let such a board
be created to investigate inventions
promising to be of service to the coun
try. Let the board study the needs of
the service and work with Congress for
the necessary appropriations to develop
and utilize such inventions as it may
recommend. The president of such a
board should be a man of courage, who
believes in progress and dares to be
progressive â a typical man like General i

It Is needless to say that he threw
away^hls clams and filled his bucket
with oysters. This was an easy mat
ter at the time, as the tide being so
very low he had only to pick them up
from the puddles.
When he got to Alameda with his
oysters he found on counting them that
he had nearly 200. The next day he
and another boy went out together and
brought back about 400. The boys
sold these and told people where they
got them. Then the "rush" to the
free oyster beds began.
At first a number of people were in
clined to look upon the oyster beds as
entirely natural, forgetting that the
bivalves were much too large to be of
the native California variety.
Investigation, however, showed that
many years ago the same company
that now has oyster beds at Alvarado
attempted to grow them off the shore
of Bay Farm Island. For some rea
son the venture was not a success and
after a loss of several thousand dollars
spent for Eastern oyster "seed" the
beds were abandoned. It was Bald at
the time that the larger portion of the
young oysters died In n few days, and
that the others absolutely refused to
grow any bigger than a 10-cent piece.
It was impossible to find any reason
for this, as the beO only a few miles
farther away did splendidly. One
Eastern expert gave it as his reason
that the proper nourishment was lack
ing in the water. Which may or may
not have been the reason.
At any rate, there are plenty of good
oysters over there now that are not
much trouble to get.
A number of the oyster fishers who
have gone there recently have been
fully prepared for the work, even to a
genuine oyster grapple. Thus equipped

One should be created. There should

and at their leisure work over the
sides.
The greater number of people, how
ever, fish with all sorts of things. On
the average the oysters lie beneath
from eighteen to twenty-four inches of
water. Since large numbers of people
have been fishing the latter figure is
the more nearly correct. And it nat
urally follows that the oysters will be
taken from the shallow places first, so
that the average depth will constantly
increase until it will be impossible to
obtain any without the proper equip
ment.
One day last week there were at least
! 200 people fishing for the mollusks on
! these public oyster beds. Some came
in row boats and some in large sail
boats. These were anchored in conven
ient places and produced a most ani
mated effect as they bobbed merrily
about on the surface of the waves.
Some of the fishers used fire shovels,
some used hoes and a number put the
garden rakes into service. These lat
ter proved most efficacious in removing
the bivalves, but had the disadvantage
of crushing the shells and so ruining
large numbers.
Without the proper oyster grapples
or tongs it is next to impossible to fish
from a boat. As a consequence most
of the people wade around in water
about waist deep, and after tearing the
oysters loose from the bottom
with a stick or hook reach
down with their hands and lift
them out. Of course this, is a wet
job, but those who go after oysters do
not mind it. In fact, they rather seem
to enjoy it, as at low tide the water is
warm and not at all unpleasant. And,
besides, they are getting the oysters
free of all cost from what is, most like
ly, the only public oyster bed. in th&

her fingers. Then her father died.
Later she returned to Oakland to
fight for a larger share in the estate.
Shortly after her return she met Val
entine Gadesden. They became insep
arable friends. He was as erratic as
she, but they found each other so com
panionable that he returned to Eng
land with her and her two boys to act
as her business agent.
The Hon. Yarde-Buller objected and
gave vent to his objections by filing a
suit for divorce, charging intemperance
and the grave sin against wifely vows.
Gadesden and "Lady" Tarde-Buller
went traveling. From Germany came
the startling news that Valentine Ga
desden was dead. Some whispered of a
duel and a wrathy husband. Others
said he was playing the piano when he
suddenly fell dead at the feet of the
woman who had laughed conventional
ity to scorn for his sake.
Once more "Lady" Yarde-Buller
came to Oakland. Scandal followed in
her wake; first tales of revelry in the
hotel where she stayed with her two
sons, then of an almost fatal illness,
brought on, so it was said, by the ex
cessive use of stimulants. Finally
Ernest Wakeman, a remote cousin, and
his wife took charge of her.
A champagne supper in a restau
rant was followed by an attack on
Mrs. Wakeman. With a cane the Hon.
Mrs. Yarde-Buller administered blows
that fell like hall on the defenseless
shoulders of her Imaginary foe. The
straitjacket followed. Then the last
flimsy veil that had hidden the vaeru
rles of this remarkable woman was
torn asunder. She was arraigned in
the Police Court. The daughter of
General Kirkham had been found wan
dering in a dazed condition over the
Oakland marshes.
After this sensational episode Mr.
and Mrs. Wakeman took her to
France. One son was a lieutenant in
the army, the other was preparing to
enter Berkeley.
Next came the news that she was in
a sanitarium, the kindlier word for
madhouse. When the doors of the
madhouse clanged in her wake soctety
thought that it had heard the last of
"Lady" Yarde-Buller. Scarcely was
her strange fate forgotten when one?
more came news that caused a ripple
of astonishment. She had escaped
from the madhouse in France and was
In New York preparing to return to
her home in Oakland. In Jersey City
by some accident she took the wrong
train. Her guardians, Mr. and Mrs.
Wakeman, had her money and tickets,
and while they were speeding West
"Lady" Yarde-Buller was put off the
train at Easton. Pa. The manager of
the hotel agreed to give her accommo
dations until she might communicate
with her friends.
So, alone and penniless, at the mercy
of strangers, she waits for the neces
sary funds to carry her back to her
childhood's home, where she may blot
out the memory' of the madhouse. She
flays she has learned that liberty is not
license.

It had a dull finish rather than a shln

.'â :w.ou!d have debarred it. years ago. from

. â its , origin at the waist line and fell about
- a'-var-d upon the ground. An immense

â¢â¢strictly a winter flower, they were rhina
, a*tors.of the description that used to
'. : gro-w In grandmother's garden. These
asters were long and feathery and were
grouped upon the shoulders at each side
of the neck.
Another new fabric is the latest gren
adine. Grenadihe is peculiar â it is ever
old and ever new. The ladies who danced
i with Lafayette wore grenadine, so also
do those who are now dancing with the
Prince of AYales. Grenadines are as nu
merous as summer days, and they are
also ls varied in price. You can get gren
adlne, after a fashion, for -10 cents, and I
had almost said that you could go up as
high as $4H for it. This new grenadine
of hich I speak is a compromise be
tween 40 ents and $40. To be exact, it
j comes at $4 50 per yard. >
The $4 50 per yard grenadine is bewll
l deringly beautiful. It is very fineâ
than that, every thread in it is the purest
silk. The threads are woven very loosely,
so that the lining Bhows through. The
latest Importations of this lovely material
come only in two patternsâ plaids and lig
ures.
In the plaid grenadinVs all of the new
colons are found. They are blended in the
mostÂ»perfect harmony, and are grouped
in squares of about two inches, some pat
terns being larger. Each square is rals.-d
upon the surface of the goods and run
ning lengthwise between each panel of'
theÂ§e box-like figures is a stripe of what
I appears â¢to be very narrow slik ribbon.
This ribbon, is really the body of the
goods, for the other ptfrTJOji Of'it seemfi
too licate and weblike to handle. '
The figured grenadine has woven in It
all the most delicate flowers of garden
or wood. I saw one pattern of deep
olive green with raised forget-me-nots
sprinkled over it, and another of the
richest golden brown traced In red
honeysuckle blossoms. A pattern that
would do for any one who does not care
for anything quite as Bhowy as the two
Just mentioned was of very shiny black
covered with bunches of wisteria
blooms.
Of course these expensive grenadines
are lined with taffeta silk generally the
color of the background of the goods,
and this maki s th.- prie of a costume
run up to an enormous amount: but
when you consider the beauty of the
gown, the length of time tnat it will last
If carefully worn, tho satisfaction you
derive from admiring glances, after all
you feel doubly repaid for the outlay
upon it.
A word must be said about Jewels
with summer toilettes. Do not expend
too much money upun them to wear
upon the hands and arms or around the
throat. Trim your costumes with as
many as you can possibly afford. If you
possess two or three brooches of real
stones or t yen the peml-preclous orna
ments, pin them with studied negli
gence over the yoke of your gown: or. if
it is docollette. put> thorn where they
will be seen to an advantage without
seeming as if you wanted to exhibit
them, and you will be much more fash
ionable than If your arms are burdened
with two or three bracelets and your
throat entwined In a string of pearls or
other ornaments.
This is the latest . fad of the fashion
ables. HELEN WARD.

(\ fp. a writer in Harper's Bazar says:
\\y; "For church and party wear there
S â is, of course, great latitude allowed,
but for play and general every-day
wear very simple little frocks are con
sidered good style, and there seems to be
a great wish to have everything as prac

worn now by children older than 12, but
many of the dresses are trimmed to look
as though they wore worn with a guimp*\
having a square or a round yoke and ,i
wide ruffle, just as a guimpe dress is
finished around the neck and shoulders.
Unless a girl is very tall for her agt,
plain skirts look the best; but if she in
tall, the skirt could have ruffles on it.
Shirt waists are now part of every litt:e
girl's wardrobe, and certainly they look
much better on children than they do on

SWEET
LAVENDER
THE very name "sweet lavender"
calls up to the mind's eye the heavy,
Ironbound, carved oaken bridal chests
whose piles of dainty linen grew un
der the girlish twinkling fingers of our
dear great-grandmothersâ thtir visible
castles of Spain. She always gathered
fresh lavender as her pih-s of linen In
creased, imd packed it away in the white
folds, which were not complete without
the clean, homely perfume.
Us odor is just as unobtrusively sweet
and fresh and dainty for us as for our
grandmothers.
Like many another fad from the times
of the minuet, lavender has come back
into fashion, though in the old English '
homes it has never been out.
It should be gathered when the purple
flowers are just out, before they begin to
. fade and drop, and In the morning' early.
I No flower's perfume is most perfect after
! the sun has shone on it long. Snip off the
| long- .stems, leaving the spikes covered
: y/ith the tiny purple blossoms, and sew
i into thin bags while fresh.
Make a double-lining of flowered or
gandie to fit your bureau drawer and tack
it around the edges with silk floss. Slip
! the heads of lavender in between the lay
j ers of organdie and hold it in place with
i knots of silk the same as the cotton is
kept in place in a comforter.
This is the time of year for gathering
lavender, and it can be bought on the
i street corners if you are not so happy as
j to have it growing in your garden. Fifty
cents' worth will make a large pad, which
will keep its fragrance till the next sea
son's lavender is ready.
Besides the perfume value of the lav
ender there is another value which very
few people know. Moths or flees will have
nothing to do with it. If you scatter the
; flowers through the trunks of winter
clothing which you put away to keep from
the moths it will be quite as efficacious
as tobacco or patent moth balls, and de
cldedly more pleasant -when you take the
garments out in the autumn. Furs, to be
I quite secure, should be wrapped with lav
ender and sealed up airtight by pasting

mRS. LTMAN ABBOTT, in the
July Ladies' Home Journal, lays
down eight rules that are essen
tial to a minister's successful
church and pastoral work. These she
has the minister himself proclaim:
1. I must be always ready to call when
invited.
2. Must catch at every straw of an er
rand to take me to one of my people.
3. Draw out from others their interests
rather than intrude my own, but always
assume a common interest in the im
provement of the town.

something on which to hang another call. and try to carry his spirit with me.
5. Never meet a person with criticism 8. Keep always in mind that it is my

GOOD TEETH AMD BEAUTY.
This department is for the benefit of all beauty seekers, and correspond
ence is cordially invited. Questions will be answered in these columns. Sign
any name that you choose, and address all communications to Mme. Hygela,
The Sunday Call, San Francisco.
Cp=?\ EAUTIFUL teeth add greatly to
V-^sl a woman's attractiveness. A
r~j) mouth full of Irregular, unsigM;y
)' â -y teeth will detract from the most
perfect loveliness in other re
spects, and many a face otherwise plain
and unprepossessing has been entirely re
deemed by a fine set of teeth.
The most beautiful teeth and those
which are best suited to the purposes for
which they were designed are of medium
size, and neither pearly white nor deeply
tinted, but of a good, sound color be
tween the very white and ivory. The ex
terior of every tooth is divided into crown
and fang, the crown being the portion
above the gum. the fang the portion be
low. The outside covering of the crown
is a hard substance called enamel. In the
interior of the tooth, surrounded by the
dentine, or softer bone, js a cavity, which
contains the essential preservatives of the
tooth.
The utmost care and attention must be
given to the teeth in early youth. The
bones, like other bones of the body, de
pend upon nutrition for health, and the
teeth of a child who is insufficiently
nourished will show early signs of de
fective structure and decay. A variety
of good food is necessary, and this should
be thoroughly masticated. A lack of
proper mastication is one of the most
fruitful causes of indigestion. Hot moats
and foods alternating with ice-cold
drinks are most disastrous to the teeth.
Among all civilised nations Americans
are said to have the worst teeth, and it
is attributed to their indiscriminate use
of hot and cold dishes and drinks.
To preserve and properly tare for the
teeth, daily attention is necessary. The
less dentrifice used the better. Some of
the advertised nostrums will do just what.
they claim to doâ whiten the teeth; but
at the expense of the enamel, and will
cause sad havoc in the vital parts? of th*
teeth. So, avoid them. Also avoid soap
dentrifices. as nearly all of them tend to
make the teeth yellow.
1 think most people recognize the im
portance of cleaning the teeth daily, but
they do not all of them realize that It is
quite as neceaaary to clean them at night
as in the morning. The fact is that a
waxed silk thread should be run between
the teeth of both jaws after every meal,
in order to dislodge any particles of food
which may have remained after eating,
after which the mouth should be thor
oughly rinsed.
The toothbrush should not be too stiff
and the bristles should be of irregular
lengths. Dip the brush in clear, tepid
water into which two or three drops of
tincture of myrrh have been mixed and
brush the teeth upward and downward,
but never across. Myrrh is astringent
and purifying and sweetens the breath as
nothing else will. Charcoal, pumice-stone
and all other gritty substances if em
ployed will Injure the enamel.
The best base for tooth powders is pre
pared (not precipitated) chalk. To this
add some powdered orris root, which
gives it a pleasant flavor and has a favor
able effect on the gums. It is also useful
to chew a bit of orris root, which Brown-
I ing says Florentine ladies love to use in
mass time.
A decayed tooth should have immediate
attention, but never have it extracted if
it is possible to save it by treatment and
filling. There ia nothing that will whiten
the teeth so thoroughly and give such a
delightful taste in the mouth as a fresh
strawberry, and from the time they ap
pear in the spring until they have said
their good-by every woman should use
one. Merely rub it over the teeth until
it is entirely crushed, and then rinse the
mouth with tepid water, so that none of
the tiny seeds will get between the teeth.
There is absolutely nothing more refresh
ing than this strawberry mouth wash.
Never pick the toeth with a metnUic
substance and never under any circum
stances pick the teeth at the table.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
ROSE R.â I would advise you to get an
ounce of alcohol, and in it dissolve five
grains of quinine. Apply this to the eye
brows every otner night, and on the
nights In between times massage very
gently wth the lingers dipped in pure olive
oil.
SADIE B.â You made a mistake. The
article that you saw was not one of mine,
but was from an Eastern correspondent
to the paper, and the salesman referred
to is in one of the shoe stores in the East.
KITTY M.â l am so sorry your cream
was not a success. Your druggist did not
uso the proper proportions or else did not
take tho trouble to mix the ingredients
properly. It takes great care and at least
an hour's time to mix them properly.
The cream should be as firm and white :

GOLD ELSIEâ only way possible
to regain the white neck is to cease wear
ing high collars. They are responsible
for mo. t of the yellow necks and so long
as the cause continues the effect will re
main, Use this whitening wash every
night: One-fourth ounce white rose
leaves steeped, in one-fourth pint each of
fresh lemon Juice and brandy for three
hours. Press, strain and decant. Put on
cold cream, too, whenever It Is conven
ient. Do write to me again after you
have tried this treatment and let me know
if it was successful."
MRS. C. E. Câ Here is a recipe for tha
very best cold cream that I know of:
Pure white wax, Vg ounce.
. Spermaceti, lVi ounces.
Sweet almond oil, I^4 ounces.
Rose water, % ounce.
Take this only to a flrst-class druggist,
who will take the time and pains to mix
the ingredients properly. Massage thla
well into the skin at night with the tips
of the fingers; let remain ten or fifteen
minutes and then wipe away with a soft
cloth.
A SUBSCRIBERâ meal, if pure,
is most excellent for the skin and a nice
way to use it is to put it into little
cheesecloth bags, moisten thoroughly and
rub over the skin. For the blackheads
scrub the face each night with a camel's
hair face brush, pure castile soap and
tepid water and use this lotion: One-half
pint rose water, one-half pint orange wa
ter; add drop by drop one-half ounce
simple tincture benzoin, six minims tinct
ure myrrh and a few drops of glycerine.
Merely sponge the surface lightly with
the lotion. '
F. F. F.â You probably are not perfect
ly strong physically, which is the causo
of your hair falling out. Anything that
will strengthen the constitution is pretty
sure to bring luxuriant locks. Why not
try the old-time remedy of sage tea on
the hair? It is a splendid invigorator.
Take a handful of the leaves and boil
them into a tea. Add two tablespoon
fuls of alcohol to the quart and use as you
would any tonic, applying it to the roots
of the hair Just before going to bed at
night. Once, a week is altogether too
often to wash the hair. Once every three
or four weeks is better, unless the hair
is excessively oily, in which case once in
two weeks is quite often enough.

F. F. also asked about falling hair. Read
what I have just said to her.
ZELLA DREWâ Taraxacum has the
effect. of cleansing the system of bile or
impurities secreted by the liver. The or
dinary dose is a three-grain pill, which
Is taken twice a day as long as the sys
tem seems to require it. For the com
plaint that you mention you might try
zinc ointment. It is usually efficacious
in that trouble. As I have said before in
these columns, I do not prescribe for dis
ease or complaints, and think that medi
cine should â¢ not be taken unless pre
scribed by one's own particular physi
cian. I can't advise you concerning the
advertised article you mention, as I know
absolutely nothing as to its merits. I do
not believe that superfluous hair can be
permanently removed by the use of a
depilatory- If I were you, I should sim
ply rub prepared chalk on the tiny halra
and pluck them out. It ia the only safe
process of removing them.
L i g.â l do not think the cocoanut
oil will have the effect that you fear.
Oils do stimulate the growth â¢of hair
where it is inclined to grow, but as it
does not usually show a tendency to grow
on the neck and shoulders, I do not be
lieve that the oil will develop it. /lou

magazine is the reproduction of eight
full-page designs by Henry McCarter

which the shading of color is attained is
mechanically ingenious and artistically
effective. It is a novelty in color print
ing, even for experts. The war has nec
essarily crowded out some of the illus
trated short stories. Richard Harding
Davis continues his brilliant chapters of

calls it "The Rockingchair Period of the

' week gave an exhibition of their

leading article of the Forum for August.
And an abler article has seldom been
written on a subject of this kind. It
shows deep thought and careful study.
"The Problem of Immortality." by James

that contains some startling statements.

Review of Reviews.
The wonderful fighting of the first three
days of July around Santiago is described
by expert writers In the Review of Re
views for August. Mr. Winston Churchill
gives In detail the clearest account yet
published of the destruction of Cervera's
fleet. The story as he tells it forms one
of the most thrilling chapters In the his
tory of the American navy. This is fol
lowed by Mr. John A. Church's review of
the land engagements that ended in the
capitulation of Santiago July 17. Both
articles are brilliantly illustrated from
Hemment's photographs taken immedi
ately after the fighting.

FRIENDS OF THE FOREST.
Last Monday evening the first session
of the annual convention of the Supreme
Lodge of the Friends of the Forest was
held In the large assembly room of Wash
ington Hall on Eddy street. There was
present a full corps of supreme officers,
excepting the outer sentinel, absent on
account of illness. The supreme body
was opened with formal ceremonies by
Mrs. H. M. Gingels, the supreme presi
dent, who after appointing the commit
tees, presented her annual report, whi< h
proved to be an interesting document
setting forth the rise, progress and pres
ent condition of the comparatively new
order. The order now hay Bye lodge*,
with prospects of several new ones in tho
near future. It has a fair membership,
and from statements that were made by
the delegates to the supreme body, there
is every prospect that there will soon be a
material increase. On the first night there
were presented by the committee on laws
and supervision, of which F. D. Brandon
is chairman, a number of amendments to
the constitution, slight, but necessary to
a better understanding of the laws, and
they were adopted.
On Tuesday the work of amending the
laws was continued, and then a per capita
tax of 25 cents was levied, after a spirited
aebte, in which nearly all of the twenty
four delegates and the supreme officers
took part.
At the session on Wednesday night

that eaeh succeeding play she would
.de-VÂ«l6jj some of the ability with which
-she "was.. credited. Miss Bouton did
â¢â¢fairly well , on . some occasions, but
.these., were few and far between, and
: it-otcame evident that she was not up
tp"the standard required in this city.
â She .haS a line stage presence and is a
Btiiftning dresser, but she cannot be
{â¢classed as even a# good elocutionist,
â¢aside from ihe fact that her acting was
acceptable only in spots. Whether
this due to carelessness or a lack of
â .fale'nt has -nothing to do with the case.
Tlie 'fact remains that the lady had
jher opportunity and made no advan
i'Ket>us use of it. Mr. Frawley Is not
â¢the loser, and the public will not com
plain. It is to be hoped that Miss
.Bouton/'S' successor will more nearly
â¢approach the praiseworthy standard
set by. the former leading lady. .
So -fa,r as Miss Tinnie is concerned
very- little of her work has been seen
here, and that was not so bad arf It
might have been. We trust the man
agement will have no regrets on ac
count of her retirement.

season, which has opened so auspicious
ly, the Tivoli management announces the

years scheming by Mr. Pennie, the de

taining f ( ,r a mythical son in the West a
monthly allowance of $100. This he ob
tains by confessing to his rich wife that
the boy was the Child of an adventuress
Who tricked him into a youthful mar
rlage. The money Pehnie har- been using up
opening of the play for a reserve
fund, which he utilized upon his frequent
and lengthy "business" trips to Sew

She is supported by Cyril Wilber, and
her repertoire includes "The Salt Cellar,
"Two Can Play at That Game." "Drop
ring a Hint," "A Dish of Dainties," "The
Passing- Fancy," and others. The great
novelties of the bill, the three Hegel
manns, who come direct from Europe for
the Orpheum circuit, are said to be the
most skilled and thrilling aerialists in
the world. O'Brien and Buckley, musical
artists, promise something new in the
musical comedy line. James Thornton,
who has made such a hit. will have a new
line of songs and a lot of patter, in which
he excels. He has scored a great hit.
The Macarte sisters will appear in an en
tire now act, which is said to be even
more sensational and thrilling than the
one in which they made their first ap
pearance. The Angela sisters have a new
repertoire for this week, as have the
Windom quintet. Wilton and Stack, the
wonderful horizontal bar performers, are
retained for one week only. Matinees
every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.
The /Ucazar.
"Richelieu" at the Alcazar was such a
popular attraction that the management
found it necessary to continue it through
out the week instead of three days, as
was intended. The work of Morrison and
the stock company was highly commend-
i able, as is shown by the fact that the
I past week has been the most successful,
! from the box-office standpoint, of the
! Morrison engagement. To-morrow even
j ing "Camille" will be presented for a
week's run, with Florence Roberts in the
; title role. This venerable standard French
: drama is about as familiar as Mary and
i her little lamb, having been given notable
productions in this city by such stars as
Bernhardt, Modjeska. Clara Morris and
Jeffreys Lewis. However, by reason of
Miss Roberts' excellent work this season
we expect a very acceptable delineation
â of this famous and difficult character.
' The cast has been well selected and the
staging and costumes will be not only
appropriate to the period with which the
play deals, but complete in detail.
Jviorosco's.
"The Cherry Pickers" will be the attrac
tion at Morosco's next week with James
Brophy in the leading role. The play is
by Joseph Arthur, author of "Blue Jeans,"
and is not, as would be inferred from its
title, pastoral. "The Cherry Pick<-rs"
are really the famous Eleventh Hussnrs
of the British army. Tlu-y were known
as the fighting Eleventh and participated
in tin famous charge of the Light Brigade
at Balaklava. As a mark of distinction
they are the only regiment in the English
army which is allowed to wear red
breeches. The drama lias nn apparent ob
ject in view in that the author espouses
the cause of the Eurasians, or half-castes.

Nazare, a half-caste aid-de-camp on the
staff of Colonel Brough. the commandant
at Rawul Pindee, becomes the hero, and
Nourmalee, the beautiful daughter of a
rich and ambitious Eurasian merchant, is
the heroine. The story is intensely inter
esting, the time being during the late
Afghan campaign in 1879-SO. Brough, in
spite of the fai-t that he has a wife in
I Englrnd, is infatuated with Nazare 3
sweetheart, Nourmalee. The hero resents
his dishonorable advances and quar
rels with the commandant, who accuses
hfm to the Viceroy of having as

THE PRINCESS WHO
WJI.NTED TO BE Q.UEE.N
Continued from Page Seventeen.
four royal Kahilis were held by the kahili bearers, one at each corner of her
bier and six at each side. Six others dressed all in velvet waved the Kahilis
over her body. You know we have a superstition about the dead. No insect
must touch our dead. I remember shrieking out once I saw her and then never
finding voice it seemed to me to shriek again or a tear to cry- I used to be
awake at night and listen to the wailing. It never ceased, you know, by day or
night for those three weeks. I thought I should go mad of it. A child suffers
In so many ways that it cannot tell. No one understood, I think, what I suf
tered In that time. I missed her so. She did everything for me. She made
all my little frocks; I have them all. The tabu is very strict, you know. It applies
to everything, even to discarded clothing. My frocks were all put away when
they were worn, my shoes, my ribbons, even to the pins which were used
fcometimes in fastening things. I will show you one of the little frocks."
She rose and went swiftly from the room and came back with a soft
crumpled mass of yellowing lace and embroidery In her hands.
"I love to sew, too," she said. "I find real happiness in sewing and being
read to just as I remember my mother did. I get my friends to read, you know
and I make a lot of the things I wear."
"Do they sit on your bed now?" I asked.
"No," said Kaiulani, laughing. "Habit is strong and they never think of
doing it." â
"I never heard of the tabu, 1 al Â°- x nav e not seen many Kingg and
Queens and Princesses, you know. I tnlnk I shook hands with you uncere
moniously."
temnlated visit into the den of Wallace,
the largest lion in captivity. A large open
air cage has been erected at the foot of
the lake, and here, unarmed and dressed
in tights. Mr. Cannon will "beard the lion
in his den." Accommodations have been
arranged for thousands and the comfort
of all will be carefully looked to. The zoo
Is as full of interest as ever and the daily
matinees are a great feature.
BARNSTORMED IN AN
OLD WOMAN'S PART
It is seldom that T. Daniel Frawley tells
a story in which he is the chief character,
but the other day he became reminiscent
and related the following experiences,
which will doubtless prove interesting to
his many admirers. About nine years agro
he drifted out of New York in the "close"
theatrical season as advance agent, juve
nile, hustler, etc., of a barnstorming
company formed for the purpose of prey
ing upon the unsuspecting people of Ver
mont in the hope ot earning bread, butter
and a few extras during the eleven weeks
of stagnation In the metropolis.
At Rutland, the first town invaded, they
succeeded In hypnotizing the landlord
sufficiently to enable them to get out of
town with their luggage, but at Mont
pelier the board bill "ghost" was too tired
to walk and the trunks were perforce left
behind. Swayne, the well-known diminu
tive comedian, had arrived that day to

''Oh, it is lifted." said Kaiulani. "Be
sides you are an American "
"Do you feel like taking the Ameri
can by the hands to-day?"
"I like them," answered the Prin
cess, simply. "I love a great many of
them. I have no bitternees against the
United States. I think this is a hasty
move forced on the American Govern
ment; a scheme which the war with
Spain has helped. And I cannot but
think it is a very great mistake. "We
would have given everything we had
to give â we always had given every
thing-, haven't we?
"My father says it is as though a
dear friend had come to us for hos
pitality and we had gladly offered our
best in his entertainment and loved to
show him every courtesy and honor
and then he had said to us, 'Go now,
out of your house. I have been so
well treated in it that I have learned
to like and want it for myself.' That's
quite true, I think, but still we do not
blame America for being influenced to
this mistake." ALICE RIX.
join the company, hoping to make both
ends meet. Notwithstanding the little
man's explosive profanity, the cruel boni
face seized his two Saratogas and the out
casts went swearing away to the next
town with no costumes, facilities for
make-up, or money. At this point the old
woman actress deserted the aggregation
to accept a salary-paying engagement,
and when the company arrived at the
next stand poor Frawley, who had been
distributing his own handbills, was told
that he would have to "play the old wo
man" in the "Ticket of Leave."
It was a "ground hog" case and after
the exercise of much blarney Timothy suc
ceeded in borrowing adress from the Irish
lady who acted as chef at the third-class
hotel. â¢
He played the part in a high Hibernian
falsetto which went wrong most of the
time and finally got him into trouble.
"I got along fairly well," said Frawley,
"until in the last scene I sat down and
forgetting the danger, crossed one leg over
another. This exposed my shoes and
trousers and those long, earnest Yankees
were so exasperated at the deception that
they hooted me off the stage and nearly
created a riot. I escaped with fhe re
ceipts, went back and took our baggage
out of pawn and we all finally succeeded
In getting to New York without walk
ing. From that day to this I have been
thoroughly convinced that I was not in
tended for a female impersona:or, what
ever my other fautls may be."
People and pia\js.
Robert Mantell is trying to get out of
the frost belt. He has condescended to
go into vaudeville, but will not go into
New York, because the court would like
to have a matinee performance by him.
Roland Reed threatens to make an as
sault upon San Francisco with three new
plays. If the Oregon were here we might
defy him.
Phoebe Davies will play another season
In "Way Down East."
Lewis Morrison and wife were to have
taken passage on the ill-fated La Bour
gogne, but, owing to his success in San
Francisco, and the extension of his en
gagement, his European trip was given
up at the last moment.
According to a scribbler in the Crite
rion, they must have had some very re
grettable vaudeville in New York. This
Is the way he puts it:
To begin withâ Bowery rot; then a dose
of coon polyglot; then a miss-every
other crack shot; then a plagiarized play
without plot; then a flickering monkeyo
graph; then a team that can't make you
laugh; then a one-act of cheap-Johnny
chaff; then the song-sheet with encores
to bore: then Maine monologues by the
score; then cake-walks andâ but no more!
(You make a bee-line for the door.)
Arrangements are being made by Fried
lander, Gottlob & Co. for the appear
ance here, in the latter part of the year,

In Frederic Vroom as its leading man
the Alcazar people have added a valuable
personage. Mr. Vroom is a good looker,
j a handsome dresser, and his stage record
I finds him associated with some of the

Hoyt's "A Stranger in New York" was

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. 6.â The tone of the stock
market to-day continued very strong. Stocks
and bonds showed a steady increase. The
movement of large contracted wealth, which
took the Initiative during the week, continued,
and the following thus Invited showed increase.
The two hours' session of the Stock Exchange
â was full of business and the demand was
eager. The preference is decidedly for the aa
eured dividend-paying interests as yet. But It
was Influenced by the possibilities of dividend
payers elsewhere. The Granger^ continued the
forward advance, but Burlington fell slightly
into the background to make way for St. Paul
end Rock Island. Dealings in these stocks
vvre very large. 40,000-share blocks frequently
being seen. Considering the week's rise in
prices the firmness at the close was remark
able. Traders are prone to close outstanding
contracts and to take profits in anticipation
of a Sunday interval, but no disposition waa
shown to seil out to-day. The heavy expansion
In loans shown In the bank statement Is mostly
due to the awakened Stock Exchange activity.
The net increase of $1,500,000 was largely from
interior receiMe. the sub-treasury daily re
port being still offset by payments on the loan
account. United States old 4's registered have
advance-3 1%; do coupon and the new 4's regis
tered have also advanced some.
Total sales of stocks to-day were 35,1f10 shares.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT. '.
NEW YORK, Aug. The New. York Flnan
cler.;thls.wee!c says: v The sta tement: of the : as
sociated â > banks of New York shows - : rather
heavy changes for the 'week ending , August S,
loans 'bayjgg | increased â â  733, 100 ! aad. <^jltÂ»
$15,371,500. The gain in cash for the week was
$1,531,400. and the surplus reserve has fallen
off about $2,000,000. The statement seems to
reflect as much as anything else the progress
of the recent financial operation of the Great
Northern Railroad which has Increased its
peferred stock by 126.000.0C0, of which $15,000.-
OVO is issued to stockholders at par for cash to
retire the outstanding collateral bonds, and
$10,000,000 being in oichange for the
stook of one of the leased lines
which had been profusedly distributed
as a stock dividend. The Chase National,
through which this operation has been oper
ated, shows a g-ain of over Jt.OOO.COO In deposits
and its cash holdings have also expanded over
$4,000,000. The National CUJ' Bank accounts
for more than a third of the cotal increase and
has lost alwut the same In specie. The deposit
gain seem? to be confined for the most piÂ»rt
to the larger banks, but in loans an increase
runs well through the list. The remarkable
activity In the bond market last week has
operated to produce some change In the cur
rent week. The season for discounting Is now
close at hand and while It is not anticipated
that the movement will be heavy, it 's inter
esting to note that the surplus reserves of the
banks are now below the point reported last
year at this time.
The decrease In surplus reserves between
July and October. 1597, was at least $IS,OOO,O<X>.
In the last six or seven weeks the New York
banks have reduced their reserves over $22.
000.000, and have not begun to ship money to
the West. The Government ho!ds heavy de
posits In this center, so that what may be
called available nr.d permanent bank money
Is not as heavy as has been estimated. Gold
imports would check the latter In any case.
LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. 6.â The . Evening Post's
London financial cablegram â  says: The stock

Americans. Buyers here are generally advlECl
to .take short profits. Grand Trunks were good
also.
The rise In securities continues. . It 1b mainly

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
j CHICAGO, Aug. 6.â Wheat started very
! strong, September opening at 67%e to 6Sc.
against 67>*Â©fi7%c at last nighfs close. There
was no appearance of any increase in the
I movement of wheat, and Liverpool sent higher !
; quotations. Showery weather in the Northwest
'â  gave the' bulls a further opportunity, as the
i trade under present conditions was nervous
i about the possibilities of a wet harvest In that
â  section. The demand for the limited offerings
In the sample market was most active, and at
from 2 to 3 cents over the previous day's
1 prices. Orders for round lots for shipment were
I on the market at a slight premium over the
ccrload price. Chicago received 141 care
against 120 a year ago, and Minneapolis and
Duluth Â£8, against 158 last year. Atlantic port
clearances of wheat and flour for the last
twer.ty-four hours amounted to 320,000 bush
els. September left off. %c higher and De
cember %ffi%c higher.
Corn received assistance from the strength
In wheat, and also from the Kansas report for
the- month showing a drop- in conditions of 24
i points compared with that of a month ago.
1 Tha weather was acting kindly to the crop,
i and it was clear that such gl it as had not
i been ruined past redemption must be" rapidly
' improving. | After the first half hour the price
; gradually worked off, closing We -lower. ,
; Oats were firm early, .but remained so as lo.ng
I as ! corn showed strength. ' There were only a
few buying orders from the country, and .all
were filled early. September lost He.
A light run of hogs and the strength in grain
started provisions firm. After the opening
ppurt, however, . the market went practically
'â  to. sleep until the noise with which the grain
i markets close woke . it up Â£()r two or three
minutes' further exercise. The net result was
I that closing prices to-day and yesterday were
! substantially the same.

BINNIE AND
NED IN CUBA.
â¢*.â  " [Synopsis of preceding chapters. Binnie and
â  Nefi, California Boys, are in Cuba,- on secret
' . perVlce for the United States and Mr. Ostend
Is also there. The Senorita Julia, a youns
â Bi>anlÃh girl, who knew all the secrets of the
Cuban patriots, has been taken away by ".he
anlah troopers ua a \ rtsoner. Binnie and Ned
have armed the mountaineers, und, accom
' banied by Cuban patriots, are pursuing the
* S-raniards to rescue her. Raniire2, Who has
- lieen supposed to be a Cuban patriot, but who
has become a Spanish spy, has hastened to give
'the Spanish captain warning Qcerning the
"plan for the rescue.]
CHAPTER 111.
EAST as Binnieand Ned and their
comrades rode, another rode fas
ter. Miles away he was speed
â  ing, sparing not the spur or the
whip. Pire flashed from the
flinty road as he droveon and on.
â â¢-. Once he reined in so sharply that his
â  horse was drawn almost to its
â¢ haunches. Through the darkness glim
mered a faint light that proceeded from
a low cabin. Following sharp upon
".the cessation of clatter of his horse's
. hoofs came a sound as if some one had
. drawn a bolt. Then pistols clicked and
: ' a man stood forth dimly in the dark
ness.
â¢ â¢ Who goes there?" demanded the
stranger.
" -â ' "Ramirez, â  the messenger of the
â  King."
.â¢â â  "Ah. it is you, then. It is time, for
â the news is abroad that the Americans
â¢ >yi'll come soon."
Â.'â¢' ' " 'Tis true," answered Ramirez,
â¢". shortly, "but I have no time to talk.
â  Quick, the relay horse and let me be
;"â â¢ off, for I bring great news, Sanchez.
.Th\e mountaineers have arms in their
. . ftan.ds at last and they are marcing al
â  -ready to. Join the rebel, Garcia. But
â¢.'saw you Captain Nunez and his band
] mt"
-.; '"They went this way with a captive
-Woman, the Senorita Julia. By the way,
â¢ Ramirez, is it not true that you once.
..fancied the Cuban cause?"
â .;.â â  "Have done with your jesting," re
;â â jp-Jied Ramirez, his eyes taking on a
' ii^ree look, "time flies; the horse at
' -.once; â¢ The two young Americans who
Yhaye' been among- the mountaineers
i.-'HvilV hunt the gallant captain at. the
â¢â '.:H&.ad \>f a company of rebels .and I go
â 'â¢Â»,.. -give warning". " Â,. , "'. â â â¢â â ;'''â 
'â 'â¢ -^"Speedily mounting the rresh horse,
â '.Katnirez sped away into the darkness.
â  'Ay hat were his thoughts? He was a
-'.'.Spanish spy. He had freely mingled
.. Vith the Cuban mountaineers, and he
knew all their secrets. At first the fire
â  : of patriotism had burned feebly within
' him. He was not made a leader
-.^Smarting at this he had vowed yenge
. &nee, .and so had become a Spanish spy.
= - : "Perhaps," he thought, as he rode

: His beadlong speed made him gain
rapidly upon the Spanish captain, and
i early the next day, just as the first
'â .rays of the morning sun were bright
ening the lovely Cuban landscape, Ra
mirez saw, at a distance, the glittering
carbines and swords of the troopers.
Ramirez was seen by the Spanish
captain at the same instant. His furi
, ous riding told that something unusual
â was the cause. Tl captain ranged his
â¢ lfVÂ«rd* along the sides of a defile,
"where they were hidden by trees, and
â  -.awaited the coming of the Bpy. As he
â¢ drew near, the captain called to him
jto halt ''Â»V
... "Very well, my captain," responded
: â¢â â the spy, "it Is Ramirez."
â  '"Welcome, Ramirez. But what brings
. you here?"
..-â¢ ."Hardly had you departed when Os
= ':tend, the Yankee, appeared. The rebels
'â '.held a meeting. The Americans fur
â¢ . nishefl them with arms and the moun
â¢ taineers are even now marching to join
: . Garcia.
"Is it so? They will never meet him,
â if there is any place they can be am
bushed."
Ambushed! The Senorita Julia heard
t;..- word, but her quick wit did not
leave hr-r, although her heart beat hard
.and fast. The Spanish captain glanc
.' ed at her, but her face was bo . b
and. unruffled that he believed that she
.had heard nothing."
: : "A mile on, captain," said the spy,
. "there is a fork in the road. Just be-
: ynnd is a bridge that hangs ovi r a
â¢.deep mountain canyon. The bridf
be- passed over by the rebels some
hours hence, unless" â
â¢;.â  The Spanish captain nodded and
â ' turning to one of his men, . spoke in a
low tone of voice, but not so low but
that the ears of Senorita Julia caught
â  th<- wordsâ "take three men, rid.; for
ward and cut the supports of the bridge
it when the rebels march upon it,
thÂ»-y will speedily dance upon air."
Unseen, the Senorita drew from her
dress a small red handkerchief, and,
â ' \A/E ?>* de munk-a-munk. but wow!
:_: _ â  â¢ See how yure unkle's klose fit now !
with trembling hands, tore from it a
â¢fragment which she fastened to a
thprri. This was the secr-t warning
. of danger that she knew the Americans
. would- understand, if it caught their
glance. The Spanish captain and his
â¢ men were too interested in the scheme
now unfolded to ambush and shoot
down the Cuban mountaineers! to
watch her closely. The plan was to
pitch day camp at the further end of
the bridge, in full sight of the road.
"Seeing us there the rebels will has
ten over the bridge, and then" â
"And then, my captain, they will fall
down among the sharp rocks in the bed
of the canyon i-nd we will leisurely pick
them off with our rifles from above."
"When the young: Americans are
dead, Ramirez, the Senorita Julia may
be your ally."
"Hush, captain, mention not her name
here; but 'twas I who caused you to
make this little journey. My letter to
ral Blanco brought you here and
placed Senorita Julia in a position
where she can never help the Cubans
:. fur she will confess or die in
prison."
As the awfulness of this plot dawn
ed upon the Spanish captain, h gaily
laughed. for his heart was like flint.
" 'Tis well," he s.-.1. "But now for
ward." The Spaniards moved on to the
bridge and crossed it and soon had a
camp fire merrily blazing by the road
side, by which th?y civoked their break
fast, while the Spaniards beneath the
bridge hacked away the supports of the
structure ur.til the timbers were nearly,
as the Spanish captain thought,
ready to fall of their own weight.
Meanwhile the Americans and their
Cuban followers drew nearer.

THE CHERRY BIRD.
BY MARY GEORGE,
LOS GATOS.
Our little girl of summers four
Playa with her doll in the open door;
The eherrybird in the trellis, vine
Sings his song from a throat like mine.
Dashes of red are on breast and head.
"Why is he singing?" our little one
said,
"Over a nest hid in the tree.
A little gray bird, his mate, you see.
Is home in the ?nug little nest,
Caring for birdies, doing her best;
To .-.Merry-bird, her heart to cheer.
Loudly sings when none is near.
He looks out for bugs and berries.
Picks for them the ripe red cherries;
And feeds them ev'ry day until
Little cherrybirds have their flJl.
Of cSefrlee res; when there, is none
herryblrd looks, but cao't find one.
Then birdies tumble out of the home,
To hunt for bugs and berries alqne.
Two are gray that fall out of bed,
And two have caps of scarlet red
With nests to match; these are the boys
That sing and sing to make a noise.
For little girls that sit in the door,
To hear their songs of joy outpour.
All day long In the summer vine,
Cherrybird sings from a throat like mine.
THE BOY'S DREAM.
BY GEORGE BARRETT,
Monterey.
IT was a cold evening in July and I
ate a lot of meat for supper, not
thinking of having bad dreams. I
was in bed before the 9 o'clock
"hoodoo" bell, or curfew, rang, and
after I went to sleep then came my
dream.
I dreamed that there was an old
farmer and his wife, who stole little
boys and girls and took them to their
home and kept them; and I was Sfnt
out to find the place and brin^ bacic
the children. I found a path that led
Into the woods, which I was sure was
the right one, for I found tennis balls
that he had taken from me piled up on
the banks of the path. These I put in
my pocket. After I had walked all
day I came to the place where they
lived. There I found a large lake,
where about fifty children were play-

ing on the beach. I found a boy there
dressed in a ridine suit, whip and all.
I said to him: "Do you remember your
father and mother?"
"No," he said; "but they live in Del
Monte.
Before night we had it all arranged
that they should follow me, for I was
going to take them home. But as they
all collected together we decided that
the boy in the riding suit and 1 would
go alone. I told then- that we would
paste up notices so they could follow
US. I sent the boy up -to the house
after a pencil. I found at the begin
ning of the path a tablet which I
pk ked rp to use for the notices. Just
at the beginning of the path there was
a short cave and just as we got half
way through the cave we came to a
large pile of dishes, reaching across the
cave and nearly to the top. We turned
around and went out, when I woke up
NETTIE AND THE PEAS. '
Little five-year-old Nettie, who had
been brought up in the city, was spend
ing a few days in the country.
"Grandma, what are those funny Mt
tle green things?" she asked, .is'they
were passing through the garden one
day.
"Why, those are peas," was the reply.
"Peas!" exclaimed Nettie; "peas
come in tin cans."

THE TRAMP'S
MAGIC KNIFE.
BY LAWRENCE C. BEMENDERFER,
Ar.geis Camp.
TOM ATKINS was the most dissat
isfied boy in the Sacramento Val
ley. He had become interested in
reading the mining news in the
daily papers and considered him
self too good for his work, and' believed
his only chance of making a fortune lay
in going to a lively mining camp at
once. Even his father and mother no
ticed the absent-minded way in which
he attended to his duties, and the tired
man grumbled at finding the tools
scattered around, and also the shiftless
way in which Tom did. his work.
About this time, in July, while sit
ting on the well porch under the trees,
during the heat of the day, Tom saw a
ragged tramp coming along the dusty
road leading to the well.
"Hello:" remarked the man as he
came up, and sitting down, helped him
self to a cup of water. "Well, this is the
nicest, coolest place I've struck since I
left Brown's camp up in the foothills."
"What, are you from a mining town?"
asked Tom quickly. I have always
wanted to meet a person from one. I
am thinking of going to one myself."
"You?" laughed the man. "Why, I
would have expected more ambitious
plans. A mining town is a rough place
even for a man. Look at me. Do I
look as if I ever saw much money? Do
I n<>w?"
Tom looked at the tramp with his
patched, ragged clothes, a limp ban
danna handkerchief tied loosely about
his neck, and his old straw hat with
holes in numerous places.
"No," said Tom, "you don't. Could
not you get work to do?"
â¢'Why, certainly," said the man, with
a short laugh. "But all that was of
fered me was too hard. lam a trav
eling musician, but of late met with
poor success. I lost a charm some
weeks ago of great value."
"That was too bad," said Tom, so
berly. "What was it?"
"Luck," remarked the tramp. "It is
one of the greatest charms of life, of
more note than money. But I have
something left" (carelessly putting his
hand into his trousers' pocket he drew
out a jackknife). "When I was in In
dia I met Aladdin. Heard of him,
sonny? The fellow who owned that
lamp. He presented this to me as a
parting gift. It is charmed."
"I didn't suppose knives were in
vented those days."
"No, but one of his descendants had
one, so it is all the same. Anyhow,
I can do wonderful things with it; go
anywhere, see anything, and by chance
have been thrown into strange places."
"Can youâ could you do anything,"
said Tom slowly.
"Yes; first tell me something you
want done. Where do you wish you
were now, this minute?"
"In the richest mining camp in Cali
fornia. lam young, strong and willing,
and would not refuse work because it
was hard, as you did. I am sure I can
get along; all I want is a chance."
"You shall have it," exclaimed the
man.
There was a large stiff mat near
them. "Step on that." Tom obeyed
and the man stepped on the other end,
opened the knife and at once the mat
rose upward and, floating above the
trees, stopped midair.
"Now," he remarked shrewdly, "here
is y :r chance. Take it if you will, but
in- .se you are disappointed do not
blame me, for I am only a plain magi
cian. If you wish I will descend. If
you go I promise to land you here be
low safe and sound five days hence."
"Yes. I will go," said Tom impulsive
ly, and immediately they began to float
over the valley and then over the low
rolling hills east toward the mountains.
Landing near a town they walked up
a long dusty road. The first faint sound
of the mills sent a thrill of delightful
expectancy through Tom. The bulky
stages, as they roiled by in a cloud of
dust, and the heavy freight teams, all
made him think only of the novelty.
As they continued on toward the mines
and mills the tramp explained that he
intended to give Tom a chance at hard
â¢work; two chances, one to get gold, the
other to keep it, "and In case you fail
at the latter you can return home at
once, for it will show you are utterly
unfitted to battle with fate."
At length, coming to a large shaft,
the tramp opened the Jackknife and at
once a parachute appeared. They be
gan to descend to the bottom of the
shaft, on reaching which Tom, by the
aid of the electric lights, followed the
tramp, who at last stopped at a drift,
and, handing him a pick and shovel,
told him to commence work, at the
same time opening the knife. Tom be
gan to dig. The place was very rich.
Gold, gold, in every place. Ho filled his
pockets and loaded himself with it. As
he worked the gold dust settled on him.
It encrusted his pick and shovel, face
and hands, and stuck there like glue.
But its weight at last began to tell. He
struggled on to procure more, never
stopping till he could work no longer.
"Take me out of this place," he cried
at last, "I have enough."
The tramp appeared. "You have not
yet proved your worth; there is an
other test to be made, follow me."
They soon came to another drift, like
the first, only there was no gold in
sight; only bare, hard rock.
All the gold obtained at the price of
hard work began to loosen and fly to
the walls of rock as if magnetized.
Tom endeavored frantically to keep it.
He tried to pry it off the rooks and
often succeeded, but it flew back, and
even when he put it In his pockets it
broke through and made holes in them.
At last he fell down on the rough floor,
exhausted, and called for the tramp,
who came at once.
"So after all your toil you are as poor
as when you begun. Would you like
to see what you look like now?
"Yes, bring me a glass," said Tom.
Opening the knife at once one side of
the drift became transparent, and look
ing, Tom beheld himself, old, gray and
bent.
"Are you rendy to return home, now
that you have lost all? Are you?"
"Yes," groaned Tom. "Let us leave
at once."
The tramp once more produced the
parachute, and clinging to it they
sailed out of the shaft away over the
hills toward the valley.
Just then Tom became aware of some
one shaking him roughly, and heard
his mother saying: "Why, Tom. how
sound you sleep. It Is time to milk the
cows." And that was Tom's first and
last trip to a mining town.
THE LITTLE ARMCHAIR.
BY MARGARET E. SANGSTER.
Nobody sits in the little armchair,
It stands in a corner dim;
But a white-haired mother, gazing there,
And yearningly thinking of him.
Sees through the dusk of long ago
The bloom of her boy's sweet face.
As he rocks so merrily to and fro,
With a laugh that cheers the place.
Sometimes he holds a book in his hand,
Sometimes a pencil and slate;
And the lesson is hard to understand.
And the figures hard to mate;
But she sees the nod of the father s head,
So proud of his little son.
And she hears the word so often said.
"No fear for our little one.
They were wonderful days, the dear,
sweet days,
When a child with sunny hair
Was hera to scold, to kips and to praise,
At her knee in the little chair.
She lost him bark in her busy years,
When the great world caught the man.
And he strode away past hopes and fears
To his place In the battle's van.
But now and then Is a wistful dream,
Like a picture out of date.
She sees a he-ad with a golden gleam
Bent over a pencil and slate.
And she lives again the happy day.
The day of her young life s spring.
When th'o small armchair stood just in
the way.
The center of everything.
"Johnnie," said the teacher to one of
the juvenile class, "in your composition
on George Washington you say fate cut
down a cherry tree with a saw. Don't
you know he chopped it down with a
hatchet?"
"Yes'm," replied Johnnie, but I
couldn't spell hatchet."

THE FOUNT
OF THE DEW.
THE Fountain of the Dew in that
beautiful land of the fairies, be
neath Tamalpais Mountain, is
the source of t'.*e sweet odors of
all the flowers that grow in Cali
fornia. The Fountain springs
from a basin, curiously fashioned by
fairy fingers, froi the shell in which,
once in one thousand years, Nltoka, an
Indian maiden who lived long, long
ago in the land now called California,
sails upon the Moon Lake. Of this
wonderful Moon Lake I must tell you
at another time. Once in one thousand
years it becomes a mirrorâ yea, more
than thatâ an enchanted sea upon
which, led by Nitok Â the fairies take
boats for the moon, sailing easily from
its face to the slanting Magic Rays,
upon which fairy boats may glide to
the Moon's silver face safely and gen-
tly.
Now there was a drought in Califor
nia, and the wild flowers died very
early in the summer. No longer the
rivers ni tured the pretty Loral faces in
their tranquil waters. The bees and
the birds h< -tented themâ dead untime
ly.
"Nay," said the solemn old Pine Tree,
"we shall see them no more. The earth
is like flint, so hard has it become; and
they are prisoners in its iron cells. No
more will they perfume the gentle gale.
No more will they embroider the
earth's robe of green in the sweet
spring time. They are dead!"
The birds heaped upon the mounds
where the flowers were buried the
sweetest smelling twigs of pine that
they could find and sang the sweetest
songs. The bees brought there the
choicest honey from their store houses
in the tree hollows, to sweeten the
ground. The trees leaned over and
cast the soft but brave shadows of
their protecting arms there. Only the
sunbeams were not sad. They darted
in and out, twinkling gayly through the
foilage of the forest, like the sudden
glowing .of Fairyland lamps and lan
terns; danced daily above the silvery
gravel in the bed of the brooks shal
lows; warmed the birds and bees and
forests into temporary gladness des
pite their losses. Just so angels come
to the bereaved.
Before the early Frost had folded Its
winding sheet of silver, in the full of
the Moon, about the meadows' and
mountains' floral darlings. Hope whis
pered once more. Pechaps the flowers
would live again. Not transplanted,
like the lost darlings of many house
holds, to the far meadows that are wa
tered by the River of Life. Only sleep
ing beneath the earthly sod â awaiting
the calling of the myriad rain drop? to
annually reawaken them. Who should
learn the truth about the flowers but
Goldilocks?
The Elves in the forests, who speak
the same language as the dwellers in
Fairyland, told all about Goldilocks.
More than that they bade Goldilocks to
visit Fairyland. The forests held up
their branches to shade her; the west
wind blew softly to fan her cheeks and
refresh her; the birds sang godspeed
to her aa she and I passed through The
carved ivory gate of Fairylanl and en
tered into the heart of Tamalpais
Mountain, hand in hand.
From the scented throat of every
Trumpet Flower in Fairyland came
the greeting to Goldilocksâ Hail!â ir>.
delightful music. For, be It known,
the llowers of Earth and the flowers
of Fairyland are of kin; and all the
trees and grasses and plants are kin
wherever they grow. So the flowers of
Fairyland were pleased at the oomtng
of Goldilo-cks, for they knew no secret
of Fairyland would be kept from her.
By magic we were both placed beside
the Fountain of the Dew and thero we
waited.
We waited only an instant for â be
hold: Hand in hand, daaoln;; almost
lixe fairies, trooping arounl Us fio-n
many unseen nooks, encircling the
Fountain of the Dew, arae all tfae
flowers of the Springâ not deadâ fully
alive, millions and millions, full of sun
shine, graceful, dainty, fragrant as
ever upon earth. There were the golden
poppies, the velvet robed wild pansies,
the beautiful grass flowers, the bravely
fringed blue chicoryâ all the sweet sis
terhood of the fields.
Smiling at the wonderment of little
Goldilocks, they crowded closer to the
fountain and caught the sparkling
drops as they fell. Every drop had its
own separate perfume No flower caught
other than its own proper odor. Hut
the flowers had to dodge so to effect
this that the scene was as if some play
ful breeze had suddenly started all the
flowering meadows of the universe to
curtseying and bowing at once. Banks
upon banks of flowers; each diffusing
rare odor; in the center the sparkling
and ever murmuring 1 , plashing and
flashing Fountain of the Dew.
The Fairy of the Fountain came to
view from I know not where. Perhaps
she was in the fountain. Her marvei
ous robe, of some rare material, spark
led with diamonds of dew and took on
the colors of all the flowers that ever
have lived. She was very small, ncu
more than a foot high.
* "Welcome." said all the flowers in
unison.
"Thank you," said the Fairy, "this is
the day when you all will receive your
odors and colors for another year and
you are freely welcome to this priceless
gift, for which you will be prized. But,
Goldilocks, what called you here?
Welcome, little friend!"
When Goldilocks told how the trees
and the birds and the bees and the
fields and the mountains were lonely
and sad, the flowers all were sorry and
began to murmur aloud.
"What?" asked the Fairy gayly, "sad
P\E umpyre is de boss of awl;

upon the Day of Color and Perfume?
Be so no more. Behold, here is Goldi
locks, who comes from the Elves. She
shall be the Messenger of the Flowers."
All the flowers clapped their hands.
Goldilocks would not stay, but has
tened forth from Fairyland that the
glad news that all the flowers were
alive and would return to the moun
tains, valleys, meadows and forests in
due time might be known as soon as
possible. â¢ â â < â¢ â  â¢ :': ' â¢ ?"â ;":"â ;â¢

This was what Goldilocks : whispered

another butterfly, bee or bird to tell
the news and so the tidings were spread

fame of Goldilocks as the Messenger of

THE GREEDY
OLD GRAY RAT.
BY CORA MELBOURNE.
OH, dear; I am so tired of this hor
rid lesson, sighed Meta, her six
year-old golden head nodding
sleepily over the spelling.
It was her bedtime, but mam
ma said she must finish her lesson.
Meta only had one more word to
learn â mouse â and had been spelling It
over and over again for the last five
minutes.
But, imagine her astonishment, when,
I AM a munk of soaring mmd â
De sorest munk dat yew kan find.
looking up, she found a real, live
mouse, dressed In red and gold, stand-
Ing before her.
"Good evening, Miss Meta," he said,
bowing. "I heard you spelling my
name."
Meta was so surprised at hearing a
mouse talk that she could not say a
word.
"But I must say good-by now. lam
going to a party, and don't want to be
late."
"Oh, do let me go with you," pleaded
Meta, not the least afraid.
"You may go if you promise to keep
very quiet."
"Oh, I will be so quiet no one will
know I am there," cried Meta.
"Then follow me," replied Mr. Mouse,
leading the way through a mouse hole
(through which Meta passed with
ease) along a passage, and into a large
hall. Here, around a white spread ta
ble sat twenty or more mice, all dressed
In red and gold.
In the center of the table stood the
very meat pie Meta had seen the cook
make that morning to poison rats.
She was just about to tell them the pie
was poisoned, when there was a loud
noise outside, causing them all to start
from their seats; then a large rat, with
a large sword, strutted in.
"I heard that you mice had a meat
pie," he began in a loud, harsh voice;
"but as I am fond of that dish myself
I have come to eat it, ' And he swung
his sword around fiercely.
"You can have it in welcome," cried
the trembling little mice in a chorus,
scared half to death.
Then Mr. Rat seated himself in the
middle of the table, with the pie on
his lap, and began to seat. When be
had it nearly all eaten a hungry look
ing little mouse asked timidly: "Please,
Mr. Rat, can't we have Just a little
taste?"
Mr. Rat was about to snap out a re
fusal, when he was seized with terrible
pains, and, falling on his face, gave
three kicks and died.
So ended the selfish rat.

TO FORETELL
CALIFORNIA CLIMATE
Continued from Page Twenty-two.
strengthen Mr. Hammond's theory and
points to a possibility that it can be
worked out to the advantage of Cali
fornia, because if we know we are go
ing to have a dry year we can prepare
for it and husband our resources.
"The way I came to discover a possi
ble means of foretelling: our winter sea
son," said Mr. Hammond, "was when I
â was making comparisons of the tem
perature of San Francisco and Vnga,
Island. I was struck by the strange
coincidence that the two always fol
lowed one another within a certain
ratio. The two extremes of tempera
ture always followed one another Just
three months apart, the time it takes
for the Japan current to reach here
from Unga Island.
"I then worked out a chart showing
the temperatures of Unga Island and
the rainfall of California. This also
â¢was most remarkable. I found that the
higher the temperature at Unera Island
in September the heavier the rainfall
here in December. This did not fail In
â¢ a single instance in ail the years of
which we have records.
"Of course it must be understood
that the further north the Japan cur
rent sweeps the warmer it will be at
Unga Island.
"My work in this line was only just
beginning, as I soon found out when I
began to hunt for records. A record of
temperature of Unga Island has been
maintained during the past four years,
showing that during the past year the
.winter months averaged five degreecs
higher temperature than usual. Un
fortunately there are no other records
known to exist from those islands of
â us dry years in California, ex
cept an old Russian record from Una
iviska Island. This covers the period
from 1828 to 1834, inclusive. It shows
tha* the yew 182S waÃ abnormally
warm, the winter months being from
two to ten degrees above the normal.
N â  fornia rainfall records are in
existence for that period, .but in Ban
croft's 'History of California' - are
given statistics of grain yields at the
; . the coast from San Ra-
San Diego. These show general
failure of these crops at all missions in
the total yieid being but 36.000
btisivls. while the average annual
for the decade 1821-30 inclu-
Bive was 5T. 250 bushels. This
marked failure in crops in 1529 is strong
evidence of drought during the winter
of 185
"As further evidence of this propo
sition there might be mentioned the
well-known fact that the dry winters
â¢ in California are also abnormally cold
winters and since the source of heat
which mitigates its temperature is the
ocean Bttcb a condition might be ex
pected when the sea has a lower tem
perature than usual.
"Of course there may not be anything
In all this. It may be merely coinci
dence., but I feel that it is worth while
to test. One important factor for us to
consider is the relationship that ap
parently exists between the rainfall in
California and the difference between
the sea and air temperatures near the
California coast. In g-eneral terms it is
evident that thoso months when the sea
is colder than the land (the summer
season) are our dry months, and con
versely those when the sea is warmer
than the land (the winter season), are
our rainy months. The amount of rain
fall appears to be somewhat i.ropor
tional to the number of degrees that
the sea temperature is higher than the
land. This was observed by studying
the records of water temperatures
taken by vessels off this coast ?s re
ported to the hydro-graphic office. It
was also observed by Professor George
Davidson some years ago. If by any
means we were able to distinguish those
years when the Bea temperatures would
be abnormaJly cold we might conclude
that those would be dry seasons for
Ca''fornia.
"Mj idea for mnkine: use or at lea::t
tesTiri'-r the theory would be to establish
a station on one of the Aleutian islands,
preferably a little further . west than

I'nalaska. It ought to be connected by
telegraph, of course, but If that could
not be done it would do to have a signal
station that could 'flag* the report to
passing vessels. In this way we could
get the temperatures for October and
know the position of the Japan current
so as to be able to make our calcula
tions.
"As it Is the observers we now have
In the north do not get in the October
rpjKirt until the spring of the following
year, at which time it is of little use.
It is my opinion that a telegraph sta
tion and signal service on one of the
AJ'fUtSan islands would more than re
pay for all the expense inside of a
year."
THE ROUND ROBIN
TENNIS TOURNAMENT
WHITNEY WINS THE FIRST
PHIZE FOB, MOST GAMES.
The California Club Singles Tourna-
ment Successful In Entries and
the Interest Displayed.
The "round roblr." tournament at the
California Tennis Club yesterday after
i noon attracted a great deal of attention.
Twelve matches ware played in all, and
although the tennis was not of the first
â  quality, the matches were, with few ex
| ceptlons, hotly contested. George Whit
| ney carried away the trophy offered the
winner of the tournament. He was placed
j fifteen point* behind the scratch. All
! other games were on an equalltv and were
not handicapped.
The first game was between Davis and
Whitney. Davis won, but not until a
deuce-in games set was played. The
score was 7â6.7 â 6. The second match was be
| tween McGavin and Stauf. MeGavin won
1 the set quite easily, securing enough
I games to attach the set while his oppo
i nent had but two to his credit. Harvey
| Walker crossed rackets with Kilgarrif,
i and took the latter"s measure with the
I score reading- fi â 3. McGavin won his sec
' ond game also, beating Davis Bâ7. The
Bet was not played according to the of
! ficial scoring, as Davis was weakened by
his hard game with Whitney. When the
! score, 7 all, was reached an agreement
was made that the winner of the next
i game should have the set.
The second game that George Whitney
i played he did not lose. Walter, his op
: ponent, felt the temper of his steel,
I Whitney not allowing him more than a
i single game. Kilgarrif beat Stauf 6-3 and
! Davis beat Kilgarrif with the same score.
Then Walter and Davis faced each other
in what at first promised to be a close
contest, but after Davis had scored three
! games Walter waded right In to the fight
and won out. Whitney beat McGavin six
games to love, and McGavin then took his
' revenge out of Kilgarrif, defeating him 6â2.
Whitney won another love set in his last
: matchâ that with Kilgarrif.
Averaging up the games, Whitney is
j easily the winner. Pie played four games
! and lost but one.
ELECTBIC LIGHTS IN SCHOOL.
Several of the Night Schools Have
Been Wired During Vacation.
Teachers and pupils attending the night
' schools were agreeably surprised on their
first visit to classrooms after vacation
on finding the rooms lighted by electri
city. During the vacation the School Di
rectors conceived the Idea of Introducing
incandescent lights into as many of the
ni?<ht schools as was possible. So far
H'imboldt. Richmond, Spring Valley and
Franklin have bef>n wired and the elec
tric lights introduced in place of the old
fashioned gas chancellors that have been
swinging from the ceiling since the build
ings wtp erected.
The Electric Light Company has been
instructed to place incandescent lights in
aii of the night schools as fast as the
work can be done without interfering
with the studies of the children.
The following are the night schools into
which electric lights will be Introduced
in the near future: The Business, Fair
; mount. Hamilton. Hearst. Horace Mann,
Irving Scott, John Swett. Lincoln, Mis
sion, Sheridan. Washington and Rincon,
and such othpr buildings a* may be used
as night schools in outside sections of
the city where the necessity may in the
future demand their- existence.
