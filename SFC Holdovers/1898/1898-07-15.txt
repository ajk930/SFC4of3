NEW YORK. July 14â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Santiago has surrendered. Its
fall, added to our marvelous naval vic
tory, which resulted in the annihilation
of practically two-thirds of Spain's
navy, ÃBLts caused all Washington to
feel well satisfied to-night with the
progress of the war.
The story of the surrender of Santi
ago is thus told in the official dis
patches:
"PLAY A DEL ESTE, July 14.âSecre
tary of War, Washington: Before San
tiago, July 14 â General Toral has for
mally surrendered the troops of hiÃ j
army, troops and division of Santiago, !
on the terms and understanding that
hie troops shall be returned to Spain.
General Shafter will appoint commis-
Bioners to draw up th-- conditions of j
the arrangements for carrying out the
terms of surrender. This is very grati
fying, and General Shafter and the
officers and men of his command are J
entitled to great credit for their U'nac- !
lty and fortitude in overcoming the al
most insurmountable obstacles which
they encountered. A portion of the
army has been Infected with yellow j
fever, and efforts will be made to sepa- !
rate those who are infected and those ''
free from it, and to keep those who are
still on board ship separated from those
on shore. Arrangements will be imme
diately made for carrying out the fur
ther instructions of the President and '
yourself. NELSON A. MILES,
"Major General of the Army."
"PLATA DEL ESTE, July 14.â Ad- i
Jutant General, Washington: Have just i
returned from interview with General
Toral. He agrees to surrender on the
basis of being returned to Spain. This
proposition embodies all of Eastern
Cuba from Aserradero on the south to
Bagua on the north, via Palma, with
practically the fourth army corps.
Commissioners meet this afternoon at
2:30 o'clock to definitely arrange the
terms. SHAFTER,
"Major General."
Although the Spanish troops under
General Toral are to be sent back to
Spain, they are to go as prisoners of
war, and in this light the authorities
consider that the surrender is to all
intents and purposes unconditional and
in every sense a complete victory for
the American troops. That it has been
accomplished without additional blood-
Fhea is a matter of intense satisfaction
to the President.
Determined as he was that the city
must be assaulted from land and sea
until the enemy had been forced to
surrender, the President to-day ex
pressed his great satisfaction at the
outcome which avoided the necessity of
carrying out the instructions to military
and naval commanders, which would
undoubtedly have involved a serious
loss of life among our own forces as
â well as of the enemy.
T'ntil word was received that the sur
render had actually taken place, there
was a great deal of uneasiness and
concern amontr officials of the adminis
tration. It was feared that the Span
ish general was bartering for further
delay, and that an assault upon the
city would be necessary in the end.
With yellow fe-er increasing among
the troops in the trenches the President
was desirous that the end should come
at once so the troops could be removed
to healthful points and those already
stricken with the dreaded disease iso
lated and quarantined.
The first official announcement was
received about half-past 2 o'clock in a
brief dispatch from General Shatter.
The President was the flrst to be made
acquainted with its contents. He was
at the time having luncheon with Mrs.
McKinley, with whom he read the dip
patch aloud and immediately sent for
Secretary Alger and Assistant tfecre
The San Francisco Call
tary Corbin to discuss plans for send
ing away the Spanish prisoners.
There was not much to be done at
this end of the line as to the details of
surrender.
"This is a matter," General Corbin
aaid, after leaving the President, "to
be arranged by General Shalter, or
rather by the commissioners under *he
terms aJreadv agreed upon. Now that
the main question of surrender has
been settled the only thing necessary
to be done is to agree upon certain de
tails as to whether the Spanish troops
should remain in town or whether they
should be marched out on the plains
to lay down their arms. I assume that
all this will be arranged this afternoon,
and General Shafter, in accordance
with the dispatch just sent, will send
the full particulars some time to
night."
Among other points to be settled be
fore General Shafter occupies the city
are those relating to the destruction or
removal of the mines and other danger
ous obstcles in forts garrisoning the
city, the disposition of the surrendered
army, etc. All these questions involve
deliberation, and some time may elapse
before General Shafter is able to report
fully upon the conclusions reached by
the Commissioners.
Now that Santiago has fallen, the
control of the territory surrendered
comes prominently to the front and in
volves to some extent the question of
recognition of the independence of the
Cubans. Members of the Cuban Junta
are talking here to-night about making
the official capital of the Cuban republic
at Santiago. They are a little prema
ture, however, in thus reckoning. It is
not the intention of the administration
to place the Cubans in the control of
Santiago at this Secretary Alger
said that the control of the surrendered
territory would be in the hands of the
military and naval forces of the United
States, and that a military government
would prevail until the Spanish have
finally evacuated Cuba and a stable
form of government had been devised.
That portion of Cuba surrendered to
General Shafter by General Toral com
prises the territory at the extreme
eastern end of the island, east of a line
running northeasterly from Aserra
dero on the southern coast, a little
west of Santiago, to Sagua de Tanamo
on the north, and almost due north
from Santiago. This territory com
prises these three districts: Santiago,
Guantanamo and Baracoa.
The western districts of Manzanillo
and Hc-lguin, with its harbor of Gibara,
were not surrendered. It is not thought
that there are any Spanish troops with
in the surrendered territory besides the
12,000 to 15,000 surrendered in Santiago
city by General Toral.
Three thousand Spanish troops were
near Guantanamo at the time of the at
tack upon the United States marines,
but I am informed at the department
that most of them effected a Junction
with troops from Holguin and cut their
way through Garcia's line into Santi
ago. These troops amounted to about
4000, leaving in Holguin district about
5800 men, 3000 of whom, however, have,
it Is feared, gone to Porto Rico with
General Bernal. In Manzanillo district
there are about 12,000 troops, and these
are still there.
The surrender, of course, carries with
it the turning over to General Shafter
of all fortifications, guns and other mu
nitions of war of all kinds in Santiago
or any other part of the surrendered
territory, as well as any gunboats or
other vessels belonging to the Spanish
Government in any of the waters em
braced within the limits named by Gen
eral Shafter. It is also necessarily im
plied that the authority of all Spanish
officials, civil as well as military, in
the surrendered territory ceases, and
that all functions of government are
to be exercised under direction of the
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, JULY 15, 1898.
commanding officer of the American
military forces.
FIVE CASES HAVE
RESULTED FATALLY
WASHINGTON, July 14.â Reports
that have reached the War Depart
ment show there has been mortality
among the yellow fever cases with
Shafter's army. This, however, has
been slight, as it is said that up to the
present time but five cases have re
sulted fatally. If any report of addi
tional cases was received to-day the
officials declined to make it public.
Meanwhile Surgeon General Stern
berg is making arrangements to sup
plement the working force of immune
physicians and nurses at Santiago. He
announced to-day that on Monday a
vessel would leave New York carrying
an additional number of this class of
workers and a large consignment of
hospital surgeons. As indicated in
General Miles' telegram to Secretary
Alger, the policy of isolating the sick
from the well at Santiago will be put
into practical operation, and the offi
cers hope that by this course the
spread of the disease will be retarded
and kept within the limits in which it
has gained a foothold.
The sick and wounded who will ar
rive in New York in a few days on the
transport Seneca will be distributed be
tween New York and Brooklyn hos
pitals pending their recovery. One
hundred are to be sent to the marine
hospital at New York and the re
mainder to various places in Brooklyn.
The ambulance ship Solace, operated
by the navy, is hourly expected at
Fortress Monroe with forty-four sick
and wounded from Shafter's army.
SIMPLIFIES THE
FEVER PROBLEM
NEW YORK, July 14.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: "The surrender of Santiago,"
said Surgeon General Sternberg to me
to-day, "makes the yellow fever prob
lem there a &nod deal simpler. Up to
this time the medical department offi
cers, with the troops packed tog3ther
under orders in the wet trenches, were
comparatively helpless to deal mosc ef
fectively with the pestilence. But low
that they are out of these trenches we
can isolate them in the hospitals on
the hills. Those who have not suc
cumbed to the fever will have been
separated, and they will not be nblo.
to be taken away with safety to other
places before they have been quaran
tined for at least five days."
While General Sternberg was deeply
sensible of the gravity of the situation,
he was averse to saying anything that
might cause alarm among the relatives
of soldiers. The fact is, however, that
the number of cases has gone beyond
the hundred mark and the conditions of
Santiago are much more grievous, 1
am informed on accurate authority,
than will be admitted by the Wa* De
partment to the public. They ar<? even
wors.i than indicated in the dispatch
from General Miles this morning, which
was with reluctance given out by the
War Department. Here is an extract
from General Miles' dispatch, the first
official information of fever among the
troops: "A portion of the army has
been infected with yellow fever and ef
forts will be made to separata those
who are Infected from those free from
it and to keep those who are still m
board ship separated from those on
shore. Arrangements will be imme
diately made for carrying out the fur
ther Instructions of the President and
yourself."
HOW PRISONERS
WILL BE DEPORTED
NEW YORK, July 14.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Trans
ports will have to be provided for from
On the Northern Coast of Cuba, Near Cape Maysi, One of the Spanish Strongholds That Pass Into
American Hands by the Surrender of Santiago. This Place Was Visited by Columbus on His
First Voyage and Named by Him Puerto Santo. The Town, the First on the Island, Was Founded
in 1512 by Diego Velasquez, Who Called It 4< Neustra Senora de la Asuncion" and Made It the
Capital and Bishopric Until Both Were Removed to Santiago Some Years Later.
SPAIN PREPARED
TO SEEK PEACE
Concessions the Castilians May
Make to Terminate the Dis
astrous War.
NEW YORK. July 14.â The Washington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following:
Independence for Cuba.
Transfer of Porto Rico to the United States in exchange for the Phil
ippines.
Coaling station in the latter island for the United States.
Spain is willing to make these concessions to obtain peace, according to
a dispatch received by President McKinley from a semi-official source.
Administration officials with whom I talked after they had learned of the
contents of the dispatch informed me that an official proposition embrac
ing these terms would be accepted by the United States. Thus, if Presi
dent McKinley's informant is correct, peace in the near future is an abso
lute certainty. His dispatch stated that the Ministry at a meeting to
day had definitely determined to abandon the struggle, and had decided
to sue for peace on the terms set forth.
In some circles I find a disposition to accept the information as entirely
trustworthy, while in others there is some doubt. There seems to be a
general impression among administration officials, however, that the pros
pect of thf* commencement of negotiations for a cessation of the war is ex
tremely bright.
This impression is primarily based upon the action of General Toral
after consultation with Madrid in surrendering Santiago and the troops
under his command. Secondarily, it is based upon the reports received
from Madrid, showing that the people are becoming convinced of the use
lessness of continuing the struggle, and that pressure is being exerted in
the interest of peace by the Vatican and by at least one of the European
powers.
The information In the possession of the authorities shows that it has
been the cry of the army from the start that it stands ready to retrieve the
losses of the navy. The fact that General Toral with between 10,000 and
12,000 men has surrendered will now doubtless cause the army to fall in line
in a general appeal for peace.
It can be stated on authority that no representation has yet been made
to this Government either from its agents abroad or foreign representa
tives in Washington respecting its attitude on the peace question or the
terms which it will be willing to accept. There is no doubt of the intention
of the President to push the campaign against Porto Rico and dispatch the
eastern squadron to operate against Spain, provided that the Government
has not been satisfied with the mauling it has been given.
President McKinley would, however, much prefer that the war would
end, and therefore is willing to be as lenient with the Spanish Government
as possible. He does not propose to demand an indemnity. Spain is too
poor to pay an indemnity, and would be greatly embarrassed if pressed on
this point. Besides, it is felt that she would rather continue the war than
to burden herself with additional obligations.
The administration is not desirous of retaining the Philippines. It
would be satisfied with Guam Island and a coaling station in the Philip
pines, and if necessary Guam Island alone, if Spain should propose, as indi
cated in the disoatch of the President's informant, to make Cuba independ
ent and turn Porto Rico over to the United States.
12.000 to 15,000 Spanish troops, which
will be taken from the city of Santiago,
probably to Cadiz.
A dispatch came from General
Shafter to-night, stating that to be the
number of prisoners within the city.
During the day a plan had been drawn
up by the authorities, the main feature
of which consisted in asking for bids
from anywhere, leaving the ships of
any nation free to .compete for the
transportation of Spanish troaps. The
authorities desired to. hear further
from General Shafter touching the de
tails of the surrender before the text of
this call for bids was given to the
President. With this end In view, two
cable dispatches were sent to him ask
ing for these details. Meanwhile noth
ing was heard from him except as to
the number of troops to be transported.
A third dispatch was sent to General
THE CITY AND HARBOR OF BARACOA,
Shafter asking for details of the sur
render, after an answer to which the
proposition of Government approval
will be given out. So man-- lower esti
mates have been put upon the number
of troops commanded by General Miles
that information as. to the real number,
although agreeing with the amount
already given h- the Herald, caused
surprise In some quarters, but on the
other hand It gave assurance- that none
of Toral's army had escaped, which was
gratifying to the President.

impossible for the volunteers of the

PLAYA DEL ESTE, Guantanamo

about 2000 tons displacement attempted
to come into the harbor about dusk to
night without permission, and met with
a surprise party. The cruiser Marble

across her bow. This, too, was dis
regarded, the gunboat coming along
under full steam.
For a few minutes it looked as if a
row was possible. The trumpets on
the Marblehead rang out a call to
quarters and another shot was sent
across the Frenchman's bows, this time
in uncomfortable proximity. That
warning was sufficient, however, and
the Frenchman stopped with extreme
suddenness.
It is against nav^l custom for a war
vessel of one nation to enter a port
which vessels of another nation are
blockading unless permission is
granted. The captain of the French
gunboat was either in ignorance of the
American occupation or chose to dis
regard it until forcibly reminded of
the fact by Commodore McCalla. The
gunboat was allowed to anchor in the
lower harbor for the night.
SPAIN DESIROUS CF
PEACE WITH HONOR
But She Will Resist Great Territorial
Sacrifices Regardless of
Consequences.
LONDON. July 14.â A dispatch to tha
Times from Madrid, says: Peace pros
pects are improving. Symptoms of a
change are especially marked in commer
cial circles. The Madrid Chamber of Com
merce has received telf-grams in favor of
peace from Cadiz, Vigo and elsewhere,
but nobody favors it at any price. The
movement may be described as a desire
for peace with honor, without great terri
torial sacrifices. Inordinate demands
might easily arouse a warlike spirit, com
pelling the Government to swim with the
popular current, regardless of conse
quences.2

MILES AND TORAL
MEET UNDER A
FLAG OF TRUCE
Terms of Surrender Discussed
by the Commanders of the
Rival Forces.
GENERAL WHEELER'S HEAD
QUA RTERS BEFORE SANTIAGO DE
CUBA, July 13, 4 p. m., via Kingston,
Jamaica, July 14. â White flags still flut
ter over the opposing lines. The truce
has been extended until to-morrow
noon and negotiations looking to the
surrender of Santiago are proceeding.
Both sides have yielded somewhat. Gen
eral ToraJ, the Spanish commander, re
alizes the hopelessness of further re
sistance and tne American commander,
pal Shafter, is inclined to reduce
the harshness of the terms which he at
first proposed to impose upon the ene
my.
It appears that on Monday General
â i did not again demand the un
conditional surrender which General
ToraJ had refused on Sunday, but of
fered as an alternative proposition to
pt the capitulation of the enemy
and to transport the Spanish officers
and troops to Spain, they to leave all
their arms behind and he to accept their
parole. It was this proposition which
General Toral declined yesterday.
This morning it was decided to hold
n personal Interview with General To
ral. General Miles and his staff, who
got no further than General Shafter's
headquarters last night, accompanied
by General Shafter and his staff, rode
out to the front shortly before 8 o'clock
under a flag of truce. A requeit for a
personal interview with the Spanish
commander-in-chief was made and ac
ceded to and at about 4 o'clock General
Miles, General Shafter, General Wheel
er. General Gilmour, Colonel Course,
Captain Wiley and Captain Maus rode
up. passed over our intrenchments and
went down into the valley beyond. They
were met by General Toral and his
chief of staff, under a spreading mango
tree, at the bottom of the valley about
half way between the lines. The inter
view that followed lasted an hour.
The situation was placed frankly be
fnro General Toral, and he was offered
the alternative of being sent home with
his garrison or leaving Santiago prov
ince, the only condition imposed being
that he should not destroy the existing
fortifications and should leave his arms
behind. This latter condition the Span
ish general, who does not speak Eng
lish, explained, through his interpreter,
was Impossible. He said the laws of
Spain giive a general no discretion.
He might abandon a place when he
found it untenable, but he could not
leave his aims behind without subject
ing himself to the penalty of being
court-martialed and shot. His Govern
ment had granted him permission to
evacuate Santiago. That was all. Fur
ther than that he was powerless to go.
Without saying so in words, General
Miles said the tenor of General Toral's
remarks all betrayed his realization
thnt he could not hold out long. When
General Shatter explained that our re
inforcements were coming up, that he
was completely surrounded and that
new batteries were being posted,
<:â  leral Toral simply shrugged his
shoulders. "I am but a subordinate,"
said he. "and I obey my Government.
If it is necessary we can die at our
nosts."
In the course of an interview General
Toral said the bombardment of Sunday
and Monday had done little damage.
He admitted that shells from the guns
of the fleet had destroyed four houses,
but he asserted that only half a dozen
soldiers of the garrison had been in
jured. He also volunteered the infor
mation, when General Miles gallantly
Inquired after General Linares' condi
tion, that the latter would probably
have to undergo the amputation of his
left arm at the shoulder.
General Miles at the interview did
not attempt to assume the direction of
the negotiations, but as general of the !
United States army he vouched for the
conditions General Shafter offered.
Upon the return of our commanders j
to the American lines a consultation !
was held at General Wheeler's head
quarters. Generals Garcia and Cas
tillo with their staffs had ridden :
around from the extreme right to see
Miles. It was a notable group gathered
under the protecting awning of Gen
eral Wheeler's tent.
Assistant Naval Constructor Hobson,
the hero of the Merrimac, who had :
come to the headquarters with mes- :
sages from Rear Admiral Sampson,
was also present. The situation was
discussed with the aid of a profusion
of maps, and at the conclusion of the :
| conference luncheon was served. After
this General Miles, General Shafter and
| General Garcia with their staff rode off
Ito inspect the position on the right
: flank. They all agreed that General
Toral was securely wedged in and that
1 escape was impossible.
Two of General Randolph's batteries
reached the front to-day and were
j posted in the center of General Law
ton's division of the extreme right,
j where they command the town beyond
our lines and over the churches, hos
pitals and other public buildings flying
i the Red Cross flag to the eastern edge \
i of the city.

EXPEDITION LANDS
AFTER A COMBAT
American Force Carries Out a Daring
Project With the Loss of Only
One Life.
j. KEY WEST, July 14.â Those cham
pion niibusterers, the Florida and Fa
; nita, under convoy of the little gunboat
| Peoria, have landed the largest and
probably the last expedition sent to the
aid of the insurgents. It was a task
, beset with peril and difficulty, costing
i one man his life and wounds to a half-
I dozen others.
Captain Jose Manuel Nunez, brother
of General Emilio Nunez, was killed.
. Winthrop Chanler of New York was
' shot through the right elbow and five
1 Cubans suffered trifling injuries. How
j many Spanish lives answered for this
i will never be known, but there were
' enough to more than balance the score.
The debarkation was effected on July
; 3 at Palo Alto, on the southern coast of
j Cuba, but the fighting occurred before
then.
On board the steamers were thirty- |
five Cubans under General Nunez, fifty
troopers of the Fifth United States Cav
alry under Lieutenants Johnson and
Ahefn and twenty-five Rough Riders !
under Winthrop Chanler, brother of j
Colonel William Astor Chanler, two I
dynamite guns, with 150 thirty-pound i
projectiles, two full batteries of light |
field pieces and a large quantity of i
small arms and ammunition.
Four miles west of Las Tunas, at the
mouth of the Tallabacoa River, stood a I
large fort, built of railroad iron and
surrounded by earthworks. The Peoria
ran boldly in and fired several shots
from her three-inch guns, but brought
no response and no signs of life. A
scouting party, made up of fifteen vol
unteers under Winthrop Chanler and
as many Cubans under Captain Nunez, I
was sent ashore. The Peoria toak a po- '
sition within short range of the fort i
to protect a landing or cover a retreat, I
as events might determine, and the
small boats headed for the shore. They
reached it 600 yards east of the fort
and the boats were beached and their
occupants cautiously scrambled toward
the brush. At almost the very moment
they set foot eu the sands the forts and |

Captain Nunez was stepping from his
boat when a shot struck him clean be
tween the eyes and he went down,
dead. Chanler f<-ll with a broken arm.
The others safely gained the thicket
and replied with a shar^ fire directed
at the entrenchments. Meanwhile the

a retreat was ordered and the party
rushed for the boats, but volley after
volley came from the shore and they
were compelled to throw themselves
into the water and paddle along beside
the boats, with only their heads ex
posed, until the ships were reached.
Five Cubans were wounded, though
none seriously.
The Peoria opened her puns on a
grove of cocoanut palms, from which
the Spaniards had been sending in a
hot fire, and must have killed many
Spaniards, for her shells dropppd into
the smoke and Hash of the adversaries'
fire, silencing it..
When the small boats reached the
ship the discovery was made that be
sides Captain Nunez, whose body was
left on the bea<"h, there were missing
Chanl- r, Pis. Lund and Abbott, Lieu
tenant Agramonte and two Cubans. It
was reported that Chanler had been
mortally wounded and was k<;"->t afloat
in the bushes along the shore by the
two doctors. Four rescue parties were
sent ashore during the night. Toward
morning Lieutenant Ahem, in charsre
<>f one of these, found Chanler and his
companions. Chanter's wound proved
to be in the right elbow. After sunrise
Agramonte and his Cubans were dis
covered and brought off.
The next clay the gunboat Helena ar
rived, and on Friday morning she and
th-; Peoria attacked Las Tunas. The
Spanish gunners fired but fifteen or
twenty shots before their suns were
living in the air, their earthworks a
mass of blood-stained dust and their
gunners running for their lives. 'Both
the Peoria and the Helena were struck
several times, but none on either ship
was injured. As they withdrew several
buildings on shore were in flames.
That afternoon both ships again
turned their attention to the fort and
the entrenchments at the mouth of the
Tallabaooa River, and for half an
hour poured a wicked fire upon them.
Thf Spaniards had been largely re-
Inforced during the day and some field
pieces had been mounted near the fort.
These replied to the American fire, but
without effect, and the shells of the two
ships speedily silenced them.
During the night the landing expedi
tion proceeded to Palo Alto, fifty miles
to the eastward. While the Helena lay
â¢ iff shore making lively play with her
searchlights toward the shore the Pe
oria, the Florida and the Fanita slipped
silently away. They reached Palo Alto
at daybreak, and the men and cargo
were put ashore without a single ob-
Btacle.
CERVERA TO BE SHOWN
MARKED ATTENTION
Will Have the Freedom of Annapolis
and Be Allowed a Limited
Quantity of Wine.
NEW YORK, July 14.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: When
Admiral Cervera arrives at Annapolis
to-morrow he will be honored with all
the attentions, excepting: the boom of
puns, usually accorded an officer of his
rank. It has been determined that upon
the arrival of the St. Louis at the An
napolis anchorage, an officer shall be
sent aboard, carrying with him papers
which Admiral Cervera and his subor
dinates will be requested to sign. These
papers place them on parole. Any who
refuse to sign will be restricted to
houses to be selected for them and
guards stationed to prevent their
departure. No doubt is felt, however,
that all will sign the papers and then
they will have the freedom of the acad
emy grounds and the city. Admiral
Cervera will have a house to himself
with servants, and will be allowed a
limited' quantity of wine.

WHAT AMERICAN
FORCES HAVE DONE
IN TWO WEEKS
Crushing Defeats of Spaniards on
Land and Seaâ Zone of Terri-
Tory Surrendered in Cuba.
WASHINGTON, July 14.â The first
chapter in the land campaign of the
United States against Spain closed to
day when the Spanish colors gave place
over Santiago to the American flag.
Next will follow the transportation of
the Spanish troops back to their native
land and the capture of the island of
Porto Rico, unless peace soon inter
venes.
The siege of Santiago had lasted two
weeks and was remarkable in many
respects, and In none more than the
heavy percentage of loss through death,
wounds or sickness of the soldiers and
sailors engaged on both sides. Look
ing* back over the record of these two
weeks it is seen that a great Spanish
squadron has been destroyed; that near
ly a thousand Spanish sailors have
been drowned or killed by shell and
flame, and that an untold number of
Spanish soldiers have died in the
trenches of Santiago. On the other
hand, about 250 American soldiers have
been killed, and in round numbers 2(00
more have been sent to the hospitals
from wounds, fevers and other ail
ments.* Our fleet had a remarkable ex
emption from disaster in the many en
gagements it had with the forts at the
entrance off the harbor and with the
Spanish squadron.
"Next is Porto Rico " said Secretary
Alger, after receiving news of Santi
ago's formal surrender, "and then, if
need be, Havana."
The Secretary was in excellent spirits.
He has been more anxious than he
dared to show as to the condition of our
sick soldiers and looked with apprehen
sion upon the possibility of a prolonga
tion of the struggle in the unhealthy
valley of Santiago. The Secretary said
that the Porto Rican expedition would
go forward immediately. It will com
prise new men entirely. The warriors
in the trenches before Santiago have
distinguished themselves and it is not
deemed proudent to bring them in un
necessary contact with new troops in
view of the danger of spreading con
tagion. The sick soldiers will be nursed
back to health and brought to the
United States as soon as they can be
safely removed. Immune regiments
will be ordered to Santiago to garrison
the town and, as stated in these dis
patches yesterday, two of these regi
ments are already under orders to pro
ceed.
The Porto Rican expedition will be
commanded by General Miles in person,
though General Brooke, now in com
mand at Camp Thomas, is expected to
be his dependence. The size of the ex
pedition will depend upon General
Miles* wishes, although it is believed
that 25,000 men will be sufficient for the
purpose. At San Juan the navy will
be of greater assistance than it was at
Santiago, owing to the possibility of
approaching the town more closely
without risking contact with mines.
General Brooke is now on his way to
Washington, by direction of Secretary
Alger, so that he will be in a position to
make his views direct to the depart
ment. The experience gained in dis
patching Shafter's expedition, it is ex
pected, will aid the officials in their de
termination to make short work of the
Porto Rican affair.
There -will be plenty of transports
available for the expedition, as the
Government has devised other means
of removing the Spaniards captured at
Santiago to Spain than by carrying
them on those transports. That the
navy is ready to do its share at short
notice goes without saying. Porto Rico
is not expected to offer a very formida
ble Resistance. It is believed that the
moral effect of to-day's surrender at
Santiago will be to discourage the de
fenders of San Juan. There is, how
ever, always the prospect that peace
may ensue before hostilities have pro
gressed against Spain's easternmost
West India island. Rumors were afloat
this afternoon to the effect that the
Spanish Government at last had made
overtures in that direction, but that
their basis probably was the current
belief that one more reverse to the
Spanish army would be sufficient to
compel the Spanish Government to sue
for peace, and that this reverse was
furnished by the surrender of Toral's
army. The Navy Department has not
been affected by these rumors to the
extent of relaxing any of its precau
tions or abandoning any of its plans,
for Secretary Long stated unequivocal
ly to-day that Commodore Watson's
eastern squadron would certainly go to
Spain as soon as it could sail.
The territory surrendered to us by
General Toral makes about 5006
square miles. The Spanish soldiers to
be sent to Spain are estimated at 10,000
men. Major Hopkins, the military
aide to Secretary Ai^rer, this afternoon
had spread before him a huge map of
Cuba, showing the surrendered zone
turned over to the American troops.
The line begins at Aserradero, about
fifteen miles west of Santiaeo harbor,
and then runs due north about twenty
five miles to Palmo Soriano. Had the
line continued due north it would have :
passed west of Holguin, thus taking !
the Spanish garrison of that point.
Evidently General Toral wished to !
avoid the inclusion of Holguin, so the !
line turns abruptly to the northeast of
Palmo and then runs to the coast town
of Del Casa, on the coast. The extreme
length of this surrendered tract is
about 110 miles and the extreme width
about fifty miles. It is a rugged, moun
tainous country with very few towns ,
of any size. Santiasâ¢ with its fine
harbor, is the main point, while Guan
tanamo is second in importance.
The Navy Department had not heard !
up to the close of office hours to what
extent the American fleet was partici- j
pating in the Spanish surrender. With
Santiago in our hands the way will be :
clear for Admiral Sampson's fleet to |
enter the harbor and proceed up to the j
wharves as soon as the torpedoes and
mines at the harbor entrance are re
moved. The fortifications of Morro
Castle Socapa, Cayo Smith and others
are included in the surrendered zone.
The possession of these fine fortresses,
particularly Morro Castle, will afford
valuable garrison points for a large
number of men.
UNITED STATES BUYS A
FAST TRADING STEAMER
She Will Be Fitted Out as a Cruiser
at Sydney in a Few Days and
"Sent North."
VANCOUVER, B. C, July 14.âAus
tralian mail advices by steamer War
rimoo contain a report that the mag
nificent Lund line steamer Culgoa has
been sold to the United States. The
report also states that she is being fit
ted out for a cruiser and would be "sent
north" in a few days. Much mystery
seemed to hang about the movements
of the vessel, and the investigations of
a Sydney Herald reporter resulted, so
the report goes, in the above facts be
ing ascertained.
The Culgrra is a very speedy vessel.
For several years she has traded to
Sydney, carrying a general cargo from
London and produce back. Her crew
number forty-seven men. When the
vessel was sold to the United States
they were mustered on board and of
fered two choices â to go home by the
Lund line steamer Tarrawo-nga or to
stay by the Culgoa and "go north." The
latter choice meant in plain English,
they knew, to fight for Uncle Sam.
The destination of the ship was pot
disclosed, but the members of the crew
to a man declared they would stand by
her. The blue anchor on the funnel of
the steamer (the Lund mark of identifi
cation) was painted over and the Amer
ican flag floated from her masthead.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C, July 14.â Mail
advices by the Australian steamship
Warrimoo, which reached port to-day,
contain a thrilling account of the death
of a tiger trainer near Adelaide,
N. S. W.
John Isaacs, an African trainer of
wild beasts, whose daring has made
him famous on two continents, while
going through the concluding act of his
tiger performance in Harmiston's cir
cus, was literally chewed up by the
tiger Duke before the horrified gaze of
at least 1000 people.
The sensational incident occurred at
Smith Gawler, near Adelaide. The con
cluding act of the performance had
been reached, when the animal was put
through the jumping feats by Isaacs.
The trainer had not taken the usual
precautions and omitted to have a suf
ficient number of attendants ready
with poles and forks. He took only a
bamboo instead of a heavy whip or
club into the cage with him and would
not have the fire gate lighted. Isaacs
was heard to say, "Now, puss, jump,"
and was just concluding the perform
ance when the savage beast, instead of
leaping through a hoop held by the
trainer, threw itself on him and sent
him to the bottom of the cage.
Then, while women fainted and
strong men rushed out of the tent in a
panic, the tiger commenced to devour
his one time master. The beast chewed
at Isaacs' throat and face first, and ap
parently maddened by the taste of hu
man blood, fairly rent parts of his
body to pieces.
Isaacs bled profusely and presented

a shocking spectacle. Twice he man
aged to get on his hands and knees
and edge toward the gate, but the tiger
played with him as a cat would with a
mouse, and hurled him to the bottom
of the cage, when his escape seemed
possible. Finally, with forks and
clubs, the tiger's attention was di
verted from his victim by attendants,
and Isaacs, a terrible sight to behold,
was dragged out of the cage. He
was removed to Adelaide Hospital,
where ho died early the following day
in great agony. It was ascertained
that one of his hands and arms had
been literally chewed to a pulp, his left
cheek and part of his nose were gone,
and the flesh of his throat and neck
were torn away to the bone.
The tragedy created a sensation
throughout Adelaide, and although the
people condemned the circus manage
ment in strong terms the latter pro
posed to go through the performance
with another man the following night.
A policeman interfered, however, and
the performance was omitted.
Isaacs was an African. 27 years of
age. His father and mother live at
Kimberly, South Africa. A Coroner's
jury exonerated the circus manage
ment of all blame and brought in a
verdict "that the deceased came to his
death by injuries received through
tiger bites."

PAN JOSE. July 14.â 0n every hand
there was voiced to-day the sentiment
that In view of the revelations pub
lished In The Call of the alleged scan
dalous doings at the Agnews Asylum
nothing less than a prompt and sweep-
Ing Investigation would do. It can be
stated that a special meeting of the
board of managers is already being
considered in this connection. If this
meeting is called there is no doubt that
it will meet with the hearty approval
of the public.
It Is argued that there Is no neces
sity for waiting a whole month. Charles
Williams is ready to file his charges
and produce his witnesses at a day's
notice. If Secretary Tourtillott and
Mrs Madlgan are Innocent of the im
moral conduct charged against them
they should be cleared from suspicion
at the earliest day. If they are guilty
they cannot be dismissed a minute too
Boon.
The affidavit of Mrs. Williams, which
appeared in The Call this morning, has
made a deep Impression on chairman
Curnow, though he is extremely loth to
believe that such conduct as therein
mentioned has been practiced in the
asylum.
Just what is to be done in the case of
Dr. F. M. Sponogle, the medical super
intendent < :' the Institution, none of the
trustees is prepared to say. The phy
sician's remarkable passiveness yester
day when the terrible crimes of mur
der and criminal assault were so dra
matically attributed to him has created
a strong presumption in the mind of
the public that he has a record. He
v'.s appointed to his present position
on the recommendation of Dr. James
R. Curnow, the chairman of the board.
There was a rumor to-day that Dr.
sle hud tendered his resignation,
but investigation showed this to be
without foundation.
T. T. Tourtillott, the medical super
intendent's secretary, is an appointee
of Frank H. Gould, whose half brother
he is. And hereby hangs a tai.- of per-
Fonal and political perfidy that is prob
ably unequaled in the annals of the
country. In the role of heavy villain,
vainly ami unscrupulously endeavoring
to lay tin- foundation for securing the
high.-!-! jMiliti'al honor in the gift of
the people, figures Frank H. Gould.
agly made mad by his high
aspirations, caution, decency, principle,
ea .mil loyalty, even to party, were
islde in the desperate effort to
catch a few more possible votes. This
is the story of Gould's almost incon
ceivable treachery and chicanery as
y one having actual knowledge of
ali the facts:
The Board of Managers of the. Ag
news State Hospital as now composed
consists of Dr. James R. Curnow
(chairman). Edward White, Frank H.
Gould, Isaac Upham and O. A. Hale.
The two latter are Republicans and the
other thr*->- are Democrats. Shortly
after the appointment of the three
Democrats by Governor Budd there
was considerable discussion on the
subject of the division of the patronage
of the asylum.

The right medicine is Dr. Pierces Favorite
Prescription. Over 90,000 women have said

Dr. R. V. Pierce, chief consulting physician
to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Insti-
tute, at Buffalo, N. Y. The "Favorite Pre-

ASYLUM FOR THE INSANE AT AGNEWS, THE SCENE OF MANY SCANDALS.
fifth of it. During this conversation
Gould asked While if there was any
special place that he desired to fill.
White said he would like to have the
secretaryship, then held by Tom Mont
gomery, a Republican, far George Pe< k
ham, a stanch Democrat. To this Gould
promptly acquiesced, saying: "Peck
ham is a good man. He was journal
clerk under me and did his work well."
White met Gould again a few weeks
after this, and the matter of patron
age being discussed, Gould remarked
that Peckham was his man for secre-
tary.
About this time the board met to or
ganize and Dr. Curnow was elected
chairman. Then the question of who
was to be secretary came up. To
Whites astonishment Gould turned to
Curnow and asked: "Whom d>> you
want?" Curnow then asked White
whom he wanted, and White answered
that Peckham was his selection.
Curnow demurred, saying that Peck
ham was distasteful to him, and Gould
fell into line at once with Curnow.
White gave way, seeing that two of
the members of his own party were for
some unknown reason opposed to Peck
ham, and in turn named Antone Friant,
John McGeoghan and Sam Rucker, but
none of these gentlemen proved accept
able, and no secretary was elected at
this meeting.
Gould, for reasons best known to
himself and which can be readily sur
mlsed from subsequent proceedings,
was not present at the next meeting of
the board. At this session White
placed Peckham in nomination for sec
retary. Curnow named Henry French, a
prohibitionist, and Hale nominated
Montgomery. For three ballots the
vote stood:
For Peckhamâ White.
For French â Curnow.
For Montgomeryâ Hale and Upham.
On the fourth ballot Montgomery was
elected by the vote of Curnow.
In a further endeavor to hide his hand
in the treacherous game he was playing
against a colleague of his own politi
cal faith, Gould at the following meet
ing of the board moved to reduce the
salary of the secretary from $100 to
|50. White denounced this action as a
play to the gallery, and charged that
t was not made in good faith. The
rifting was redhot thereafter.
The secret motive for Gould's pecu
liar conduct became apparent when
the time came to fill the place of secre
tary to the medical superintendent,
which was held by E. R. Bailey, a
Democrat, who had filled the position
most acceptably. The position pays
$l. r >o a month. Gould has a half-brother
whose earnings did not reach this fig
ure. So Teddy Tourtillott, who has the
reputation of having been a good Re
publican before he entered the employ
<>f the State at Agnows, was slated for
the position of secretary to the medi
cal superintendent by Would-be Gov
ernor Gould. Tourtillott is the gentle

tests of White, Bailey was removed
and Gould's programme was carried
out with the aid of Curnow and Hale.
It is common talk that the selection
of Montgomery and Tourtillott for their
respective positions was the fulfillment
of a pact between Hi'le and O-">uld. and
that Gould betrayed his party and his
Democratic colleague for the aggran
dizement of his family connection. But
th*'ie are those who charge even worse
than this against the man who will be
in future known as one of the greatest
political fakirs and mock reformers
that the State has ever known. It is
reported that Gould's absence from thÂ»Â»
meeting ;it which Montgomery was
elected secretary was due to influence
Jjrought to boar by Jim Itea, the politi
cal boss ol S::nta (^lara County, who
controls both the Democratic and Re
publican political machines of that
county. Just how Gould's aspiration")
for th 1 Governorship are to be fur
thered by Rea has not yet developed.
But it is a well known fact that Hale,
Montgomery and Curnow are first of
all Rea or "gang" men, and only sec
ondarily Republicans or Democrats.
It waa only aft^r a hard-fought con
test by V\"hite that Bailey retained a
place :tt th<> asylum. He was mn>
bookkeeper to the steward with a sal
ary of $7.-: a month.
A eianiCcant fact in connection with
the election of Tourtillott was that hi:
was not nominated by Gould, but by
Hale, a Republican.
But Gould's craving for fat places at
Agnews for his pets was not satisfied.
He imported Mj PS Louise D. Rambauer
from Merced and made a place for her
at the asylum. But this was only the
entering wedge for something more in
fluential and lucrative. White had
been conceded tho place of matron,
and had named Miss TClla Royce for
the position. Miss Royce fulfilled all
her duties faithfully and well, but by
a persistent course of nngging and spy
ing, aggravation and insubordination,
Miss Bambauer incited Miss Royce to
such a pitch of indignation that in a
moment when self-respect rose superior
to self-interest, the matron resigned.
Since then Miss Bambauer, under in
structions issued by Gould, has bo.>n
acting as matron, and is spoken of as
the successor of Miss Royce. Gould's
purpose in this matter will probably
be carried out at the next meeting of
the board.

and conscientious character result from
the charges made by Mrs. Williams and
the statements made by Erwin Frost

WILLIAMS' STORY
OF THE SCANDAL
Tells Why His Wife Was Discharged
for Knowing and of Gould's
Duplicity.
SAX JOSE, July 14.â Frank H.
Gould, as a Janus, as a deliberate
pledge-breaker and as an unprincipled
self-seeker, is graphically portrayed by
Charles Williams, the husband of the
young woman unjustly dismissed from
the Agnews State Hospital.
On learning the facts in connection
with the discharge of his wife, Wil
liams sought justice at the hands of
Gould In a private interview at the lat
ter's office. How his effort resulted
Williams tells in the following inter
view:
"My wife was dismissed from the
asylum at the regular meeting of the
board in March. Mr. Gould made the
motion, and when the grounds of his
action were asked for, he demanded
favorable action on his motion as a
personal favor, emphasizing his re
quest by his vehement tones and ex
traordinary dictatorial demeanor.
"Mr. Hale stood in and declared that
motion should be adopted as a cour
tesy to Mr. Gould, because he was
chairman of the management commit
tee. The motion was adopted.
"Subsequently I was recommended
by the board to have an interview with
Mr. Gould t<> adjust the matter of the
: reinstatement of my wife. The mem
' bers told me that personally they were
anxious to see my wife go back into
the asylum as an employe, that they
' had looked up her record and found It
I entirely satisfactory in every way, that
â¢ she had always discharged her duty
i faithfully, that she had shown great
sympathy and care for the patients
and that her character was above re
j prnach.
"I was told by Mr. Hale that the
reason assigned by Gould for wanting
Mrs. Williams discharged was that she
was a mental wreck and labored under
i mental hallucinations. This reason
! was given at a caucus called by Gould,
at which he, Hale and White were
present. The caucus was hold just
I previous to the board meeting, at which
my wife was discharged.
"During the regular meeting Mr.
l I'pham asked why Gould wished to
i discharge Mrs. Williams. Dr. Curnow
spoke up and said: 'Mr. Gould, per
haps she knows too much of the crook
ed work of your brother.'
"Gould replied that he wanted her
dismissed for personal reasons. The
| vote was taken and Gould gained his
; point.
â 'Acting on the suggestion made by
the other members of the board I called
; on Mr. Gould in his office in San Fran
cisco to endeavor to secure the rein
statement of my wife.
"I introduced myself to Mr. Gould,
but he enotvwJ a decided aversion to
granting me an Interview when he
learned that I was the husband of the
woman whom he had caused to be un
justly discharged. I informed him that
I had called in regard to her reinstate
ment. He attempted to bring the meet
ing to an abrupt end, but I finally pre
vailed upon him to listen to me by curt
ly telling him some unvarnished facts.
Our interview lasted more than an
hour.
" 'I believe you treated my wife un
justly.' I said. 'She had always done
her duty and had received many rec
ommendations in reference to the
?; inio.' I showed him the recommenda
tions, and he answered that 1 did not
know all the workings of the case.
" 'Your wife has been made the cats
paw,' he said, 'of a dirty crowd of con
spirators, who wish to throw my
brother out of the employ of the asy
lum.'
'I -eplied *h:tt htf was mistaken. I
told him that my wife had reported to
me at once the fact of having observed
Mr. Tourtillott, Gould's half brother,
come out of the room of Mrs. Madl*ran,
which is located in a different and dis
tant part of the building from Tourtil
lott's, at nn unseemly hour of the night.
I informed him that my wife considered
this a flagrant breach of good conduct
anil that she was greatly disturbed
with fears of the trouble that such ac
tions would eventually precipitate in
the asylum. T further told him that I
had instructed Mrs. Williams to be
truthful in the matter and to let the
blame rest where it should.
"Thereupon Mr. Gould stated that he
had sent a resignation to his brother
immediately after hearing the accusa
tion against him; that his brother
signed it at once and returned it to
him to be read at the next regular
meeting of the board. He added that
he had subsequently investigated the
charges made by my wife and had ar
rived at the conclusion that she was
suffering from mental hallucination,
and that there was no truth, to his
mind, in the charge. 'If there were
any truth in it,' he said, 'my brother
would have to go immediately. I would
not stand such conduct if it were my
own father.'
"I told him that others had seen the
same things witnessed by my wife;
that they had told my wife about it,
and that their story had only thrown
more light on the fact that his brother
was undoubtedly guilty of immoral
conduct. 1 informed him that these
same people were now afraid to open
their heads, because their bread and
butter was at Btake, as he sought to be
the predominating member of the
board.
"His answer was that he had had a
detective In the building and was thor
oughly aware of all that occurred, and
had good reason to believe what his de
tective told him, notwithstanding the
reports of others. 'How do you know
that your wife is not suffering from
mental hallucination, and that she told
the truth?' he remarked.
"I then Urld him that the ex-matron
knows this ncandal to be true and has
good evidence of the fact; that on one
occasion she st-nt Miss Fogarty, one
of the employes, over to the room of
Mr. To-urtillot, ordering her to knock at
the door at 11 o'clock at night and de
mand that Mrs. Madigan go to her own
quarters, and that Mrs. Madigan com
plied in about half an hour. I informed
him that the ex-matron told me that
Miss Fogarty had seen the lights in
Mrs. Madigan's room burning from 12
o'clock until a little after 4 in the
morning; that at the latter time Mrs.
Madigan entered her room, Â«^tinguish
ed the lights and retired; that the rea
son the burning lights attracted parti
cular attention was that Mrs. Madigan
should have been in her own room, ac
cording to the rules of the establish
ment, at 9 o'clock, but did not reach
there until after 4 a. m.
"To further substantiate the correct
ness of my wife's charges I told Mr.
Gould that Dr. Sponogle had remarked
to the ex-matron that poor Teddy, that
is Tourtillot, was mixed up in a pretty
bad scrape, but they had sufficient pull
to get him out all right, and that the
other people were kicking because they
didn't have so g<rod a show.
"At this point he interrupted me with
considerable show of anger, saying,
'If you have come up here to blackmail
me you might just as well consider our
interview at an end. I have had to do
with such bluffers before.'
"I quietly t<>ld him the interview was
not over, that I was not on any such
errand, but that I merely wanted him
to do justice to my wife and that he
must admit that she was neither a
malicious person nor a liar. I told him
that I did not propose that my wife
should be crucified for the sins of
others. The interview, which lasted
about half an hour longer, concluded
by his saying that I must excuse his
display of temper, as he was suffering
from a nervous headache. He shook
hands at parting, expressed cordial ap
preciation of the part 1 had taken in
the matter and gave me the wwarmestw r armest
assurances that justice would be done
my wife. He declared he would talk it
over with the other members of the
board and that he had no doubt in his
mind but she would be reinstated. He
added that if a motion were made for
her reinstatement he would make no
objection, but would content himself by
remaining riuiet and allowing the board
to dispose of the matter as It saw fit.
H^ requested me to see one of the
other members and have him make the
motion.
"Afterward Gould came down here
to San Jose and said to Hale and Cur
now, two of his colleagues, who with
him compose the Gould clique, 'Wil
liams has got you turning in your beds
at ni'gnt under the spurs of a guilty
conscience for the way you treated his
wife. I gave thim a nice little send off.
because It. was policy to do so, but if
that bluffer thinks he can run me I will
show him that he is mistaken. 1
"Before the next meeting of the
board he held a caucus over the matter
and was very emphatic in his demand
that the matter of my wife's reinstate
ment be not acted upon. He intimated
that we would get tired of the contest
and would soon be content to remain
silent, and would not file any charges
against his brother In connection with
the woman scrape. His wishes were
obeyed. The meeting following this
was that of Wednesday, the result of
which is know known.
"I shall now certainly press the
charges, and only wish that action on
the matter could be hastened. I am
ready at any time to present my case."
WILLIAMS ASSAILED
BY DETECTIVE FROST
fistic Encounter Growing Out o? the
Expose at the , Agnevs
Asylum.
SAN JOSE. July 14.â Charles Wil
liams, husband of Olivia Williams, who
was subjected to indignities at the
hands of Dr. Sponogle, had an encoun
ter with Erwin Frost at the latter's of
fice this afternoon. Williams received
a black eye, but otherwise w-as unhurt.
He swore to a warrant before Justice
Gass, charging Frost with battery.
The latter's trial was set for July 18,
and he was released on his own recog
nizance.
Williams was seen at his home at
Santa Clara to-night. He said that
yesterday evening Frost told him to
tell Trustee White he wanted to see
him. This Williams did, and to-day he
went into # Frost's office to give him
White's answer. Williams says Frost
took him into his back office and closed
the door. He Bays he told him, "Mr.

BACRAMENTO July 14.â The fusion '
wing of the Populist party completed
its labors to-day and adjourned. Of .
the ticket it placed in the field most of
the nominees are "dummies," named on
the distinct understanding that they
were to si â  i other po
litical affiliations and were used merely
to comply with the letter of the law.
Of those who will remain on the
ticket to the end, every one was select
ed at the instance of the Maguire
clique. The head of the ticket is a
Democrat, having nothing in common
with the Populists, and who is not even
expected to subscribe to the- platform
on which he was placed, or at most to !
give it a negative indorsement. Two
others are Republicans with an insati
able appetite for silver, whose names
were presented to the Populist conven
tion not by those of the faith but by
their own kind, who invaded the coun
cil hall of an alien body for the pur
pose. Such a spectacle is unprecedent- :
ed in the annals of political gatherings,
and in Itself is an eloquent sermon on
the desperate straits into which the un
holy trinity has fallen.
While the action of the Maguire re
concentrados in nominating a Demo
crat for Governor has resulted in the
disruption of their own party, their
leaders are boasting to-night that they
have placed the Democratic party in a
position where it must yield to their
dictation. They declare that the Demo
cratic convention must now accept Ma
guire whether it wants to or not. In
other words, 154 Fusion Populists, man
aged by and in complete control of a
handful of the Congressman's lieuten
ants, have outlined the course which,
they say, the 700 delegates who will
compose the Democratic State conven
tion must pursue. Instead of being a
"Democratic side show," as they are
dubbed by the middle-of-the-road
sters, they boast that they are the
main three-ringed circus, with the
Democracy of California as an auxil
iary 10-cent after-concert.
Probably 125 delegates were present
when Chairman Hutchinson called the
Fusion convention to order at 9 o'clock.
The members had exhausted them
selves the night before and were anx
ious to finish their work and go home.
Cornell of Alameda arose to a ques
tion of privilege and said It had been
reported by the middle-of-the-roadsters
that the fusionists intended to pass a
resolution releasing Maguire from the
obligation to indorse the platform
adopted yesterday. Cornell said such
a statement was absolutely without
foundation, and that Maguire would be
obliged to fulfill his obligations to the
convention.
Without loss of time the delegates
were divided into district conventions
for the purpose of nominating Railroad
Commissioners. There was little inter
est, and no contest in the First District,

G. B. Dean being selected, while the
Second District adjourned without
making any nomination. These two
are conceded to the Democrats, but in

expect to retain, there was more life.
Judge J. L. Dryden of San Diego was
nominated by acclamation after the
delegates had listened to several lau
datory speeches.
The report of the committee on con
ference was presented and adopted.
The equalization districts then met
and made the following dummy nom

First District, which deferred action
for the time; Second District, William

George Thresher: Fourth District, M.

A resolution was adopted permitting
the Silver Republicans to present the
names of their candidates for Clerk of

Court Justice, those being the two po
sitions allotted to them according to
the terms of the conference.
The Congressional districts were
given an opportunity to make their se

that it had already nominated C. A.
Barlow. The Second renomlnated Ma
rion de Vries. the Third John A. Jones
of Alameda and the Sixth C. H. Castle.
The First, Fourth and Fifth districts
adjourned to meet at the call of their
respective chairmen. They will await
the action of the Democrats before pro
ceeding further.
Nominations for Lieutenant Governor
being in order. Motherall presented the
name of T. W. Maples of Kern, who,
he said, was the only member of his
delegation who had not bolted.
Carlson nominated E. L. Hutchinson,
according to the prearranged pro
gramme, and the usual flood of second
ing speeches was turned loose. States
man Montieth's declamation was inter
rupted by the announcement that San
tiago had fallen and the convention
broke into loud cheers. After everybody
had become thoroughly tired of all the
talk over the merits of the two candi
dates Maples withdrew and Hutchin
son was nominated by acclamation.
After that it was easy. Tnere were
few patriots who cared to be set up by
the convention only to be hauled down
again, and so as rapidly as anybody
could be found to make the sacrifice he
; was rushed through unanimously. In
this manner A. B. Kinne, for Secretary
! of State; A. R. Sprague of Los Ange
i les, for Treasurer; George W. Hoyle,
for Attorney General, and George H.
Rosens, for Surveyor General, were de
clared the nominees of the convention.
For Control! r J. W. Reay, T. W.
I Maples and John W. Koegan were nor
n mated. Reay and Kcegan withdrew,
however, giving it to Maples by accla
; mation.
The Silverites then had their inning
and the unusual spectacle was present
ed of Republicans appearing before a
Populist convention on invitation and
nominating candidates for office who
were ratified unanimously. Judge Phil
lips presented the name of H. I. Mc-
Craney oi Sacramento for Clerk of the
Supreme Court, and in doing so took
occasion to touch upon his quarrel with
Oeorge W. Baker.
N;ithan Cole Jr. nominated Judge
Walter Van Dyke of Los Angeles for
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,
and after he had boon formally passed
upon the Populists put up A. C. Mouser
of San Diego as thoir dummy for the
second Supreme Justice.
For Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion Chrif Runckle of Dutch Flat was
thf unanimous choice. Professor N. A.
Richardson of San Bernardino with
drawing in his favor.
Percy B. PreblÂ° of Alameda wa.s given
the empty honor of the nomination for
Public Printer, which completed the
ticket with the exception of the few
places left open.
Sprague, from the committee on reso
lutions, presented the following, which
was adopted:
A\ heroas, \\ c recognize the tremendous
strength of the forces that brought de
feat to the cause of monetary and civic
reform in the last national campaign and
realise that to refuse to co-operate to
secure the utmost efficiency in tne organ
ization of the reform forces is to court
defeat; therefore.
Resolved. That we, the members of the
P'-opln's party of the State of California,
hereby extenn to all other reform parties
a hearty greeting and declare ourselves
ready to form with them a solid phalanx
for monetary and civic reform in the cam
paign of 1900, making a single party with
a representative name and with principles
broad enough to rally to Its banner all
who dare to stand forth to resist the
forces of monopoly and corruption that
are crushing manhood and threatening
the very life of the republic.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 15, 1898.
Four of the Maguire "Push" Who Helped to Corral the Fusion Reconcentrados.
After the usual votes of thanks had '
been passed Wardall offered a motion,
which was defeated, expelling the bolt
ing delegates. A recess was then taken
till 5 p. m. to enable the State Central
Committee to organize.
Just as the convention adjourned T.
V. Â«'ator appeared and asked to be per
mitted to read the report of the confer
ence committee, stating that his con
vention would like the privilege of in
dorsing, if they saw proper, such Popu
lists as had been nominated by the !
others, whom the Democrats would per
mit to remain on the ticket. There was
some disposition not to accord Mr.
Cator's request, but it was finally
granted.
The closing session was very brief.
On motion of Wardall, the Cator reso- \
i lutlon, which slinned through yesterday,
| was knocked out. The convention pro-
I vided for the appointment of an audit
i Ing committee at a later date by the
chairman. Two changes in the State
Central Committee, as submitted to the
convention, were made. Ring of Hum
boldt was removed and V. S. Avers
substituted, while J. D. Monahan of
Sacramento was substituted for Camp.
After appointing Van Meter, Peck
and Baker a committee on law Chair
man Hutchinson announced that the
convention stood adjourned to the call
of the chair.

FUSIONISTS QUOTE
CRIMINAL LAW
Believe They Could Send the
Middle-of- the- Roadsters
to Prison.
SACRAMENTO, July 14.â Late to
night the leaders of the fusion faction
of the Populists unearthed a section of
the election laws under which they be
lieve they can send every man who par
ticipated in the middle-of-the-road con
vention to jail. The provision In ques
tion is section 1190, article 2, of the elec
tion laws, which reads:
No certificate of nomination shall con-
tain the name of more than one candidate
for each office to be filled. No person
shall join in nominating, under the provi
sions of this Code, more than one nom
inee for each office to be flllecPand no per
son who has voted in a convention for or
against a candidate for any office shall
join in nominating in any manner any
other nominee for that office and no per
son shall accept a nomination to more
than one office.
The Penal Code provides as a penalty
for violation of this section six months'
imprisonment and a fine of $500. The
fusloniata do not say that they will
make examples of the bolters, but they
talk significantly of what could be
done. THeir hostility seems to be con
centrated on T. V. Cator, whom they
charge with being the prime mover in
the revolt.
WINS ONE OF SANTA
ROSA'S FAIREST FLOWERS
Harvey S. Jordan of Seattle Leads
Miss Julia O'Meara to the
Altar.
SANTA ROSA, July 14.â The residence
of Mr. and Mrs. James O'Meara of this
city was to-day the scene of a brilliant
society event, the occasion being the mar
riage of Miss Julia O'Meara to Harvey
S. Jordan, cashier of thr Seattle Post-
Intelligencer, and one of the rising young
busines men of the Northwest.
The ceremony took place in the draw
ing room, beneath a canopy of greenery
and pink sweet pea blossoms. The whole
house was decorated in harmony with
the scheme adopted for this room, and
the effect was charming. The Rev. James
Cope, rector of the Church of the In
carnation of this city, was the officiating
clergyman.
The bride was attended by her sister,
Miss Pollie O'Meara, as maid of honor,
and Miss Bess ltiley as bridesmaid, while
Dr. W. B. Morse of Salem, Or., acted as
beet man. Little Grace Dougherty, who
in May was the queen of the flower car
nival held In this city, attended the bridal
party as fiowergirl.
At the conclusion of the ceremony and
after the congratulations had been ten
dered the guests sat down to a breakfasr.
When the bride's cake had been cut and
distributed among the members of the
bridal party, it was found that Miss Flor
ence Boggs had the penny, supposed to
be typical of the fact that she woul-I
soon marry some one well supplied with
this world's goods, and Miss Bess Rilsy
was found to have the bride's ring, a
dainty affair of costly workmanship, in
the form of a true lover's knot.
The bride is one of Santa Rosa's fairest
and best known society girls. During her
residence in this city she has made hosts
of friends, a great number of whom as
sembled at the train this afternoon to
wish the departing couple godspeed on
their journey to Seattle, where they will
In the future make their home.

SACRAMENTO. July 14.â The mid
dle-of-the-road Populists who bolted
the convention when their iaol, T. W.
H. Shanahan, was turned down in the
interest of Co trressman Magulre met
at 10:15 o'clock this morning in the Sen
ate chambers. They were as full of
fight as they were last night when they
took the bit in their teeth, set up an
opposition convention and nominated
Shanahan for Governor.
The first order of business was the
reading of the report of the committee
on credentials by Murphy of Shasta. It
showed that over ninety delegates who
were present were entitled to seats in
the convention. After the report had
been adopted Batten of Alameda in
troduced a resolution extending on be
half of the People's party the right hand
of fellowship to all Populist delegates
who might desire to have seats in the
convention on condition that they ratify
the action taken up to the time they
were seated. The resolution was
adopted with great applause.
On recommendation of the committee
on permanent organization the tempo
rary officers were made permanent. The
committee on platform reported back
the platform indorsed before the bolt
and it was made the platform of the
middle-of-the-road men without a dis
senting vote.
In order that the nominations be
made doubly certain Shanahan was
again placed in nomination and amidst
cheering was declared the choice of the
convention for Governor.
Crawford of Kern next placed Chair
man D. T. Fowler of Alameda in nomi
nation for Lieutenant-Governor,
ler took the floor and after thanking the
convention said that it would be im
possible for him to accept the honor
conferred.
An adjournment for an hour was
taken, and when the convention re
assembled Fowler was of a different
frame of mind. He accepted second
place on the ticket and the delegates
cheered wildly.
On motion of Murphy of Shasta,
Joseph A. Johnson of San Francisco
was nominated by acclamation for Sec
retary of State.
Green Majors of Alameda, after con
siderable persua ion, accepted the
nomination for Attorney General.
Frank Houghton of Tehama was, on
motiun of Cator of San Francisco,
nominated for State Treasurer.
J. R. Garner of Lake County was the
unanimous choice of the convention for
State Controller.
An attempt was made to Induce J.
E. Cramp of Sacramento to accept the.
nomination for Surveyor General, but
he positively declined to serve, and the
nomination went to C. S. Preble of
Berkeley.
W. H. Gilstrap of Tulare declined the
nomination for Superintendent of
Public Instruction, and it was given to
John W. Duncan of Tulare by acclama
tion.
Z. B. Stewart of San Bernardino was
chosen for one of the Assistant Jus
tices of the Supreme Court. The dele
gates wanted to srive the other nomina
tion to Thomas V. Cator, but he said
that he could not accept it.
Silas M. Pevyer of San Diego was
next nominated for Clerk of the Su
preme Court and Melville Snow of
Santa Barbara was nominated for
State Printer.
The convention then divided into dis
trict conventions to nominate Railroad
Congressmen and members of the State
Board of Equalization. After an hour
and a half of deliberation the conven
tion was called to order by Chairman
Fowler and the following nominations
reported:
Railroad Commissionersâ First Dis
trict. H. C. Wilkins of Lake; Second,
C. D. Rodgers of San Francisco; Third,
A. Bretz of Alameda.

TRAIN ROBBED BY
NEVADA OUTLAWS
Express Car and Safe Blown
Oper>, but Little Booty Ob
taiQed.
RENO, New. July 14.â Passenger '
train No. 1, east bound, was held up
last night one mile east of Humboldt.
The exj>rr*s .-ar was blown up and the
Bafe was blown open". The robbers es- j
raped. It is not known how much booty
they obtained. According to some ac
founts but two men were â¢ngaged in,
the robbery, while others place the
number at three. A negro who was a 1a 1
passenger on the train was suspected
of having been an accomplice of thtÂ«
robbers and arrested. It may be that
he is the third man.
When the train arrived at a point
one mile â¢ ast of Humboldt two masked
men boarded the engine. F.nginper
Wickland and Fireman McDermott
were taken off tho engine and compelled
t.. co to th.- express car, the robbers
climbing over the tender and covering
them with a revolver and a Winchester
rifle. The robbers blow open the ex
press car door with dynamite, entered
th'- <ar and tht-n blew the safe open.
The car was completely demolished. No
one was hurt in th> j explosion.
Sheriff McDeid of Humboldt County
and a posse are in close pursuit, and
It is believed the robbers will be cap
tured, as they only had a few hours'
Btart of the officers.
It is thought the robbers boarded the
train at Reno, riding on the blind bag
gage until it reached the point at which
they carried out their plans.

STORY OF FIREMAN
AND MESSENGER
WINNEMUCCA, N< v., July 14.âFire
man McDermott, who was on the en
gine of No. 1 wh'-n the train was held
up near Humboldt, gives the following
account:
"A mile east of the Humboldt House
I heard a noise at the buck end of the
tank I king up, saw two men
climbing over the coal. One had a rifle,
which he pointed at me, and the other
covered the engimer with a pistol.
They kept us covered until they
reached the gangway. One of them
told the engineer to stop the engine
and he did so. The man then told us
to get off th^ engine anÂ«l to go with
them. I asked if I could put on the
Injector, bo that the engine would not
burn up. and I was w!d I could. They
kept the guns on up while they waited.
They then ordered us to leave the en
gine and followed us to the express
car. After firing a few shots In the
ground they told us to knock on the
door of the car and to tell the mes
senger who we were and not to shoot.
"We did .so and the one with the pis
tol knocked on the door, called to the
messenger to open. Instead of opening
the door the messenger put out his
lights. ThÂ» robber then put a small
ptick of giant powder under the door
and touched it oft saying:
" 'I guess that will fetch him.'
"The door was partly blown open and
they caiU-d th^ mess nger again. This
time h" came to the door, but they s -nt
him back to light a lamp. He was then
told to climb out of the car and be a
p 1 fellow. After the messenger came
out of the car the robber climb^l in and
placed a large dynamite cartridge near
the door of th^ safe. After lighting the
fuse he jumped out and we went ahead
as far as the engine, where we waited
for th<* fxpi.Â»sioji. The report was ter
rific, and we could pee the side of the.
car burst out and the roof raise.
"After a few moments all went back.
"While one of the men kept us covered
the other went in the car and placed
what valuables he could find in a sacki
After ransacking the treasure boxes he
came out. The engineer, messenger
and myself were told to Join hands and
walk ahead. After walking away from
the train a little ways we were told to
halt. The robbers shook hands with us j
and saying 'Adios,' disappeared in th<>
Qarkness, while we went back to the
train.
"One of the men was of medium
height, with reddish beard and hair,
and the other was shorter and very'
dark. They were both cool and seemed
to know what they wre about.'
Messenger Hughes said:
"The train stopped so suddenly that
I paused in my work to listen a.nd soon
heard the engineer and fireman knock-
Ing at the door of the car and tilling
mf who it was and not to shoot and
some one then spoke In a gruff voice,
demanding that I open the door. In
stead of doing so I took up a rifl* and
putting out the lights, laid down by the
safe.
"In a minute therf* was an explosion
and the door was blown open. It wa.s
very dark and I realized that if I shot
I might hit one of the trainmen. I
concluded the best thing to do was to
give myself up. I walked to the door,
but was told to light a lamp and get
out of the car, which I did. I asked
if I could fix my papers and was told
that they .would be fixed all right. One
of thf robbers then got Into the car
and blew open the safe. He broke
open thÂ» treasure boxes, placing what
hf could find in a sack. do not know
how much was in the safe, as we do
not carry keys. There was not much
In the treasure boxes."
The rest of tfc messenger's story was,
Jn substance, the same as that of Fire
man McDermott.
WELLS-FARGO'S LOSS
IS BUT TRIFLING
B. D. Brastow, the superintendent of
the western division of the Wells-Far
go Express Company, Bald regarding
th<Â» Nov;h];i robbery:
"I ran make no estimate on the lofs
to the company. That in valuables
taken from the safe amounts to only a
trine. The greatest loss is the damage
to the car, which will amount to about
$1000.
"A telegram came from Sheriff Mc-
Deid of Winnemucca c,,unty to-day
giving tho following description of the
three men implicated in the hold-up:
One was of dark complexion, medium
height, rather slender, with a short
stubby red beard. He was about 26
years old. The second man was very
dark, and may have been part negro
He was about five feet ten inches in
height, with broad .shoulders and
weighed 170 pounds. H e talked and
walked very quickly. The third man
was about five feet ten inches in height
weighed about 160 pounds and wore a
black beard about two inches long
"The Sheriff also ntMed in his 'tele
gram that he had started from Hum
boldt on horseback with three men and
an Indian trailer. The pone took a
trail to the north from Humboldt and
I think Is on the right track. The Sher
iff found marks near the scene of the
hold-up indicating that there had been
three horses tied to a pile of ties about
100 yards from the track. The robbers
wore armed with rifles and pistols and
all wore masks. Sheriff McDeid states
that they have the negro who was on
the train In custody. By this I presume
ho means the negro passenger whom
Conductor Lothrop said held a ticket
from Folsom to Humboldt. I hardly
think this man was implicated in the
robbery."
The Southern Pacific has offered re
wards of $1000 each for the capture of
the men.

TO WAR AGAINST
CORRUPTION AND
GANG METHODS
Object of the Good Government
League of Santa Clara
County.
PAN JOSE, July 14.â An organization
that will take a prominent part in
Santa Clara County politics this fall is
the Good Government Learue of Santa
Clara County, which until recently has
been almost unknown. The league was
organized in January, 189S, and now
has a membership of about 1500. Near
ly every precinct of the county has
been thoroughly and systematically or
ganized, and workers are still busily
bringing in new members. The doings
of the league are conducted secretly
and this accounts for its great
strength. It is Republican In politics,
and its sole purpose is to purge the
party of corrupt and gang methods.
The members take great interest in the
league's work, and they will prove a
big factor in the coming campaign.
Headquarters have been opened at
room 32, Knox block.
The officers of the Good Government
League are: President, E. A. Hayes;
first vice-president, C. M. Wooster;
second vice president, J. R. Patton;
secretary, H. G. Squier; treasurer, T.
E. Beans. The executive committee
consists of fifteen members, among
whom are such prominent men as J. R.
Johns of Saratoga, G. H. Coates of
Campbell, W. F. Williams of Berryessa
and T. C. MacChcsney of College Park.
The movement is truly a reform one,
for the most enthusiastic workers of
th? league are the best citizens of the
county. Following are some of the
members: C. T. Settle, president of the
Farmers' Union; Dr. H. Melville Ten
ney, pastor of the First Congregational
Church; A. H. Stinson of Franklin dis
trict; Dr. N. A. Haskell. pastor of the
Unitarian church; Dr. W. D. Mc-
Dougall, George ML Bowman, F. 11.
Babb of Berryessa; C. D. Blanev of
San Jose, O. Stevens of Coyote; Judge
B. G. Hurlburt, master San Jose
Grange; W. P. Craigin, president
of Farmers' Club: H. L. Stevens of
Evergreen. ex-S* â ervisor W. A. Z. Ed
wards of Orchard, Colonel E. G. Hall of
Moneland, J. J. Btanfleld of Los Gatos
and Dr. D. Van Denberg of Vineland.
E. A. Hayes, president of the league,
was found at the headouarters in the
Knox block, and consented to an inter
view on the purpose of the organiza
tion.
"Mr. Hayes, the Good Government
League has taken a stand against the
removal of Professor Smith from the
San Jose High School. I am informed
that you are the president of this
league; is that correct?" asked The
Call man.
"Yes, sir," answered Mr. Hayes. "I
believe that is correct."
"Would you object to telling The Call
something about this league, its objects
and purposes?"
"No, sir; I should be glad to do so.
The Good Government League of Santa
Clara County is an organization of sub
stantial, taxpaying. Republican voters
of this county. It is not confined to
San Jose, but is organized in every pre
cinct in the county. Its objects are
perhaps sufficiently indicated by its
name, 'The Good Government League
of Santa Clara County.' I might say,
however, that in general Its objects are
the advancement of the cause of good
government; the election to office of
pure, capable and fearless men, and an
active organized opposition to any com
bination of men who seek to subvert
the public service solely to selfish and
mercenary uses.
"Another object we are aiming at Is
the complete divorcing of our publlo
schools from politics," said Mr. Hayes,
"and especially such politics as we
have at present in this county. We
believe that capacity, experience and
real worth should be the only quali
fications considered in selecting teach
ers for our schools. Attempting to
work a 'political pull' to secure a po

Tragic Death of a San Franciscan

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, July 14.â P. W.
Reiner, a wll-known character of San
Francisco, committed suicide in Mill
Valley last night by shooting himself
through the head. He was found near
the Cascades this morning. Reiner was
lying in â Â« pool of blood and near him
lay a revolver. The bullet had entered
the right temple and came out behind
the left ear.
Coroner Eden was notified and
brought the body to the morgue here.
A card in one of the pockets of the
clothes gave Reiner's address as 917
Market street, San Francisco, rooms 1
and 2. There were found a baby's ring,
a tspanish silver dollar dated 1796 and a
bill of sale showing he had purchased a
half interest in the real estate business
at the address given.
Reiner came to Mill Valley yesterday
afternoon. He acted naturally and at
tracted no attention.
About two and a half years ago
Reiner was a partner in the real estate
business with J. F. Schottler of San
Rafael. He received word of his
mother's death and that he had been
left $250,000. After returning from Ger
many, whither he went to get his in
heritance, he became a roysterer. spent
much of his money, and was once ar
rested and brought before Police Judge
Campbell for flourishing a revolver in
the old Cremorne Theater. So strangely
did he act that his sanity was called
Into question. Upon examination he
was sent to the asylum for the Insane
sition In our schools ought to be suf
ficient proof that the person who re
sorts to this method of supplanting
more worthy rivals is not fit to be a
teacher of the young. The machine
politician's method of selecting teach
ers is corrupting and un-American in
itself, not to mention the demoralizing
Influence of incompetent teachers with
low moral standards. Our schools
must be kept pure and thoroughly
American above all things. If they
are not so, it is better for the children
and the community that they close un
til they can be purified."
"Mr. Hayes, are you at liberty to
state anything in regard to the plans
of the league for the Immediate fu
ture?"
"We are all loyal Republicans, and
are -working for the objects above
stated as Republicans. When the
proper time comes we shall demand on
behalf of the Republican voters of
Santa Clara County opportunity for a
full and fair expression of Republican
sentiment in the selection of all dele
gates to Republican conventions, to the
end that every Republican may have
a voice In shaping the policy of the
party in this county, and in the nomi
nation of its candidates. In short, we
shall demand a fair deal within the
Republican party in this county, and
most emphatically intend to have It."
"But suppose you fail to get this fair
deal, what then?"
"In the language of the immortal
Lincoln, we 'never cross a bridge until
we come to it.' "
"I suppose your league contains mem
bers who are candidates for the vari
ous offices to be filled In this county
this fall?"
"No, sir," Mr. Hayes answered em
phatically, "on the contrary, our doc
trine is that the office should seek the
man, and not the man the office. I
know that I am speaking the senti
ments of most, if not all, of our mem
bers when I say that they are not can
didates for any office, and they would
regard it as a hardship if the circum
stances were such that duty compelled
them to accept a nomination to any
office. We are organized not for spoils,
but solely in the interest of good gov
ernment and to do all that we can to
purify the political atmosphere of Santa
Clara County."
"It is reported, Mr. Hayes, that you
are to be a candidate for one of the
offices to be filled at this fall's election.
Is not that correct?"
"No, sir. Please say for me as em
phatically as you possibly can that I
am not a candidate for anything, and
under no circumstances would I ac
cept a nomination to any office, how
ever exalted. Were I Inclined to do
so, which, I repeat, I am not, my po
sition in this league, and the active
work I have done in furthering its in
terests would make it impossible for
me to do bo and keep any of my self
respect. I do not know of anything
more contemptible than an office-seeker
wearing the cloak of political reformer
in order to advance his own interests.
No, sir, the only political ambition I
have at present Is to see the public
business of Santa Clara County in the
hands of the purest, most capable and
businesslike set of public officials that
were ever elected in any county. I
want to see the politics of Santa Clara
County In keeping with its beautiful
climate and location, and the high in
telligence, morality and patriotism of
its people."
"What is the present membership of
the league. Mr. Hayes?"
About ISOO, and rapidly growing."
"Are you at liberty to state what
the conditions of membership are?"
"We do not welcome office-seekers
and machine politicians very warmly;
indeed, our aim Is to keep these all out.
We do, however, want every Repub
lican voter who has no 'ax to grind' to
Join with us in an earnest effort to cor
rect the present abuses here and to
purify the political atmosphere of
Santa Clara County."
at Ukiah, anrl upon being released went
Into partnership with a man named
Healey in the real estate business in
San Francisco. It is supposed that
Reiner grew despondent and committed
suicide because he had squandered his
money.
ANOTHER PROMISING
CROP OF DOCTORS
MEDICAL AND DENTAL STTJ-
DENTS GRADUATE.
Dr. Nieto Thinks the Office of the
Physician More Godlike Than
That of the Clergy.
The graduating; exorcises of the medical
anrl dental classes of the College of Physi
cians and Surpeons were held last night
at Native Sons' Hall, which was crowded
to Its utmost capacity. The stage was
neatly decorated.
After an invocation by Rev. John A. B.
j Wilson, a well written and interesting 1
j paper on "Nature and Functions of Lit
erature" was read by Professor Melville
B. Anderson of Stanford. He contended
that there is some affiliation between lit
erature and medicine. "Literature," said
the speaker, "brings sunshine into our
hearts and drives moonshine out of our
heads, and no physician can be the worse
for having literary culture, an acquisition
that will largely widen his influence for
j good."
Professor J. R. Lane, M.D., president of
the college, thereafter conferred the de
grees and presented the diplomas. The
graduating classes are as follows:
Medicalâ Howard Marion Block, Mary Bird
I Bowers. Laura B. Hopktns-Hadley, William

; Aura Theodore Covert of Long Beach; Charles
â  Moses Griffith of San Jose; Norman IXiuglas
i Kelley of Fresno, and George Thomas Milll
ken of Redwood City.
In presenting the diplomas President
Lane made only a few remarks, saying
that the faculty expects the graduates
in their professional relation with each
other and the public to observe the gold
en rule. Aside from this he saw no need
of a code of ethics.
"Healing a Divine Art," was the well
handled subject of a brief address deliv
ered by Rabbi J. Nieto. He compared the
clergy and the medical profession and
â wmit so far as to describe the latter as
being the more godlike of the two.
After several selections by the orch?s
tra the graduates with the faculty re
paired to the California Hotel, where the
Beeond annual banquet was enjoyed.

AGNEWS IN BAD REPUTE.
REVELATIONS concerning the management of
the asylum at Agnews are startling. To learn
that the existence of gross immorality in a
State institution could even be suspected is in itself a
shock. The charges gain apparent strength from the
directness with which they are made, the confidence of
the accusers, as well as the insinuation that the half
has not been told but in due season will be given
I ity.
rdless of what may appear later, if the allega
tions already of record shall be proved in part the
asylum must be cleaned out, the guilty dismissed.
There is no middle course. Either the accused have
been cruelly slandered, or they are unfit for places of
trust. Prompt investigation is an urgent necessity.
If innocent, they will be glad of a vindication such
as can result only from the fullest and freest scrutiny
of all the evidence; it they are not innocent, the de
mand is equally urgent.
The individuals especially concerned are Dr. Spon
ogle, T. T. Tourti'otte and Mrs. K. Madigan.
Against these the charges are definite, and in each
instance of such nature that if established they would
leave no alternative but dismissal of the trio. The
only proper course is to have the facts laid bare
through unbiased official inquiry. No whitewashing
is demanded by the occasion, and no effort to gloss
over the offenses will be tolerated. Nothing less
than an absolute conclusion will satisfy the people,
for the people have grown tired of corruption among
their servants.
The truth is demanded, and in getting at it none
should be protected by influence nor assailed from
motives of revenge.
SCHOOL VACATIONS.
THE problem of whether the public and other
schools should be continued without vacation
throughout the entire year is now up for discus
sion in the Eastern States, and prominent educators
and educational journals are considering it As a kin
dred question the need of vacation schools is being
urged by some, among them President Eliot of Har
vard.
The problem is chiefly one for the towns and cities.
It has been said that the vacation of country chil
dren is not subject to the same reasoning Â«.s that of
the urban young folks, because when they are not
going to school they are busy receiving a practical
education for the duties of life by helping their
fathers and mothers on the farms.
The city children are mostly idle during the vaca
tion, and if the vacation is extendid longer than the
needed rest there can no good come of it Those who
favor long vacations say that the growing minds of
the children are already overtaxed, and that teachers
seek to put into them more than they can assimi
late. This question, like all others, has two sides to
it, but it is to be noted that the abolition of long
vacations will not be wholly an experiment, for the
German schools are run all the year round, and the
results there are said to be good.
Perhaps the solution of the matter that both par
ties might compromise on would be to do away with
or greatly shorten the vacations, and at the same time
correspondingly lessen the load that is laid on the
young minds by reducing their daily tasks and short
ening their hours of mental application. Thus they
would accomplish the same progress during the year
and do it with far more ease.
There is no doubt that in a very long vacation the
mind not only forgets a large part of what it had
acquired, but it loses the habit of application and
power of attention. Long idleness is about as bad
as overtraining. It is far more arduous to start to
work after the relaxing of a long rest than to keep
at It with moderation.
Perhaps the enterprising contractors who have let
the making of uniforms to Chinese would have ex
cited less indignation if the uniforms made had been
of decent material or cut. As it is, white labor suf
fers, and the soldiers, in whose welfare all take in
terest, are arrayed in a lot of misfit togs of varied
hue, and on parade give the impression of having
equipped themselves at a second-hand store. Alto
gether there has been a very scurvy piece of business
done, and the people responsible for it will find that
it will not be forgotten in a hurry.
Nevada guardsmen are said to be threatening not
to enter the Federal service unless they shall be al
lowed to name their own officers. By glancing at the
files of San Francisco papers they may ascertain with
profit that the trick was tried here once, and that it
lacked much of working to the satisfaction of the dis
contented.
No people is represented by finer, more manly look
ing soldiers than the regulars who marched on board
ship yesterday.
Neither candidate of the Populists has whiskers
worth mentioning. One by one traditions fade*
REPUBLICAN STATE CONVENTION.
WHEN the selection of the place at which to
hold the Republican State Convention is con
sidered from the standpoint of individual
preferences or prejudices, there result almost as many
opinions as there are cities in the State. Each indi
vidual is of the opinion that his own town should be
chosen, and if put to it can give forty reasons for the
choice. When considered broadly, however, from the
standpoint of party welfare, and the comfort and
convenience of the delegates to the convention, there
is but one opinion. Upon such consideration it is
universally agreed that San Fraudsco is the place to
be chosen.
With respect to the comfort and convenience of the
delegates to the convention it is hardly possible to
make an argument for any other city against San
Francisco. Even when State conventions are held
elsewhere a large majority of the delegates come to
San Francisco before going to the convention and
return here alter it adjourns. It would be more con
venient for them to remain here.
Moreover, it would be more comfortable for them
to remain. The weather is cooler and pfeasanter here
than in any other city in the State, and the work of
the convention can be more agreeably and ener-
getically done. The hotel accommodation is much
superior to that of other cities, as are also the ac-
commodations of restaurants. In every respect of
comfort during the session of the convention as well
as of convenience of travel in coming and going San
Francisco is beyond rivalry in the State.
Equally potent are the arguments in favor of the
city when the welfare of the party is considered.
The determining vote of the State is in this city. It
is therefore expedient that delegates to the State
convention should be in touch with the sentiment
of the people of the city in making nominations.
When conventions meet in other cities the delegates
begin to scatter as soon as the nomination for Gov
ernor is made, leaving the other nominations to the
hazards of logrolling, or the push, or the caprice of
a faction. That does not happen when conventions
assemble in San Francisco. Every delegate remains
here to the last day of the session. Every one at
tends to the closing work.
It has been argued at times that owing to the many
hotels and lodging-houses in San Francisco the dele
gates get scattered and cannot be so easily found as
when conventions are held in smaller cities where
there axe but one or two hotels. That argument,
however, tells in favor of the city and not against it
when considered from the standpoint of party wel
fare. The scattering of the delegates prevents them
from being herded by the bosses, inveigled into cor
rupt combinations and voted in masses. It also gives
the exhausted delegate a chance to get away to him
self from the roar and clamor of the crowd, and thus
by rest recover his force and clear-headed common
sense for the performance of his duties.
The subject is one which the State Central Com
mittee should deal with from the standpoint of party
expediency and upon the broadest considerations.
The Republican convention should be held in this
city by all means. Being the metropolis of the State
and centrally situated, it is the natural convention city
of the commonwealth. This is the place where the
convention can do its best work, and it is, there
fore, the best place at which the convention can
meet.
THE HfI PPY FAMILY.
OF course the merry war in which Maguirc has
become a central figure is none of our fight.
We have the privilege of looking on and ob
serving whether the ring tactics are fair or foul, un
moved by concern as to whether the Populists get
hit below the belt or in this manner administer a
knockout blow to the Democrats.
Populists declare they have so shaped events as to
make impossible to Democrats- any action save in
dorsement of their man Maguire. Comforting as it
would be to see the wordy Congressman bowled over,
as he must be as surely as he receive the indorse
ment for which his soul yearns and his jaw makes
plea, we confess to inability to discern why the Dem
ocrats should feel under obligations to submit to the
dictation of the Populistic element in the political
happy family.
Maguire was nominated by 156^ Populists. With
great wagging of beards they proclaimed him the
Moses to lead them out of the wilderness, and they
lay down the law that the Democrats shall do the
same thing. They are willing to divide their, Moses.
In the Democratic convention will be 700 delegates.
Will these submit to the direction of the talkative
handful? It does not seem reasonable. Perhaps they
will be found to have minds of their own and tell the
Populists to keep their little old Moses.
But in either case Republicans have nothing to
worry about. We would be glad to see Maguire in
dorsed with a whoop. From the standpoint of Dem
ocracy no worse move could be made. Maguire
would be defeated with an ease that would give him
pain.
ENGLISH SCHEMES IN AFRICA.
' Z^J NGLAND'S proverbial success as a colonizer
6eems now about to achieve a most notable con
'â* firmation of her right to such reputation. The
great representative of Anglo-Saxon prowess in this
field, Cecil Rhodes, has been strong enough to tri
umph over that great error, the Jameson raid, which
would have been fatal to many a strong man less
strong than he, and is again planning, like a sort of
Bonaparte, for the colonial conquest of Airica.
He has been re-elected as a director of the Char
tered Company of London, and has met with a re
ception that shows confidence and willingness to
back him in his big ambitions. In his address to the
shareholders of that company he roused their enthu
siasnywith the catching cry of "Cairo to the Cape."
The idea is to connect Egypt with the Cape of Good
Hope by rail, and on that vertebral column
build an English Africa.
Rhodes' purpose, as a step in that direction, is to
borrow in England two million pounds to extend the
present railroad system of South Africa to Lake
Tanganyika, which is on the northern boundary of the
English domination in the Dark Continent. This
would bring the overland route from the Cape to
within less than 1800 miles of Khartoum, the place
to which the English expedition from Cairo under
the Sirdar Kitchener is advancing to oust the Der
vishes. It is claimed that if these two points are at
tained the remainder of the railway will be an easy
matter of attainment.
Six million pounds are said to be already invested
in the combined enterprise, and the British public are
asked to put up the two millions more that are
needed to complete the undertaking. The sharehold
ers are to be made secure in their investment by the
state's assuming the money so employed as a debt,
and for their profit Rhodes is to give the company a
half interest in all the mineral wealth of the country
traversed.
If Rhodes' design should be carried out and the
connection made of the Mediterranean with Eng
land's possessions in South Africa, the ambitious

dream of making the big continent practically an
English colony might well be within the realm of
possibility. In the meantime, however, it is to be
remembered that in Africa, as in Asia, France and
Germany axe to be reckoned with as well as the na
tives.
A TEARFUL SITUATION.
THE sorrowful spectacle presented by the Demo
cratic party of California at this juncture is cal
culated to bring tears to the eyes of even as cold
and unsympathetic a thing as the tin angel on the
i dome of the City Hall. The campaign has been
opened by the party candidate for Governor accept
| ing the nomination of the Populists. If Judge Ma
guire is a Democrat, there is but one principle in
j the platform adopted at Sacramento on Wednesday
to which he can properly give his adhesion. We re
fer to the plank which denounces the war as a finan
! cial scheme of the Republican moneycrats for the un
i doing of "the people." This ought to receive Ma
; quire's approval. He regarded the early capture of
Spanish ships as "piracy."
But to repeat. The melancholy spectacle presented
', by the Democracy at this juncture would draw tears
â  from an even more obdurate object than the City Hall
angel â if, indeed, such an object were capable of un
derstanding the depth of degradation to which it has
descended. Its leaders at the outset have sold their
principles, not alone to the band of office-seeking
Populists who met at Sacramento on Wednesday, and
who represent nothing except an ardent desire to get
at the State treasury, but also to a band of fifty cent
dollar manipulators, who call themselves "Silver Re
publicans."
Herein is disclosed the most terrifying political
fusion ever consummated in the State. The "Silver
Republicans" are mostly stalwarts. For years they
have been "pointing with pride" and "viewing with
alarm" the acts of the Democracy and Its allies, the
Populists. Not one of them but has contemplated
a hundred Democratic tickets with horTor and aver
sion. Not one of them but carries a dozen Demo
cratic scalps at his belt.
Yet at the coming election the Democratic rank
and file will be called upon to walk to the polls and
i vote for two Silver Republicans. It is not enough
: that it should be asked to swallow eight Populists,
who, under the fusion programme, will obtain places
I on the Democratic ticket, but they must vote for two
Republican renegades. Will they do it? That ques
tion time alone can answer. In the meantime Dem
1 ocratic hearts may as well bleed hereabouts. There
never was a period in the history of that party when
it needed sympathy so much as now. It has been
I sold to an office-holding syndicate; pirates are in
i command of its ship and it is heading directly for
the rocks, with nary a lighthouse working.
But if this is not sufficient to excite the lachrymose
glands of the tin angel it need only be added that the
fused party is being supported by a boodling sheet,
around which still lingers the odor of railroad black
mail. Indeed, it is quite probable that some of the
money obtained by the Examiner through its $1000
a month contract with Huntington is now being used
to aid Maguire's election to the governorship. The
Southern Pacific paid $22,000 under that contract,
1 and unless Hearst has used more in cutting off the
i heads of Spanish soldiers than he should, some of the
coin ought still to be available for the campaign. But
what a spectacle 1 The Democratic party sold to the
I Populists for the gubernatorial nomination and sup
' ported by a newspaper which has been convicted of
', blackmailing the Southern Pacific Company out of
$22,000 in gold coin â not fifty cent dollars, mind you,
I but good, hard, yellow dollars, worth 100 cent 9
i throughout the world.
Unless the tin angel objects to displaying her grief
in public, she should begin weeping immediately.
There is scarcely time to get in a real hard cry ere
the bells will ring for the big Democratic funeral in
November. Then everybody will have to shed a tear
over many new made fusion graves.
SPAIN'S DEGENERATION.
THE study of the causes of Spain's downfall is
one of the most instructive in history, and with
her past three centuries of descent before us it
is a curious matter of speculation as to how far that
degeneration is to go. Is her course a curve that
will somewhere reach it 3 lowest point and thence rise
again to power? Or is it a straight fall, to end only
by striking bottom and staying there? Will it con
tinue till she sinks from a master into a subject na
tion and becomes merely semi-civilized, or will she
reform, as individuals sometimes do, and start on an
upward course after her lessons have been made fit
tingly severe?
Perhaps the fact will lie midway between these two
suppositions and Spain's doom is conservatism â to
find her ruin by remaining stationary, by proudly and
stupidly refusing to progress by the paths that the
successful nations are pursuing. It has been held by
some that such a condition is impossible, that there
must be a movement either up or down; but Turkey
is a witness that in the modern world a non-progres
sive nation may be long permitted to live and to con
tinue to perpetrate outrages. There is little doubt
that if Spain now deserved to have her nationality de
stroyed, and the United States both could and would
destroy it, united Europe would stay the extinction.
So Spain may exist on for centuries, like Turkey, as
an obiect lesson, to teacVi national morality.
A baleful conservatism has been one of the chief
causes of Spain's change from a great to an insig
nificant nation. Some conservatism is good, but hers
was of the wrong kind. She persisted in methods of
military conquest in her colonies when she should
have studied the arts of conciliation. She refused to
learn her lesson and change her policy, as she might
have done, like England. She persisted ir fettering
men's consciences after the enlightened nations had
found out the folly of it. She persisted in that form
of pride which made her strongest and most intellec
tual men despise industrial pursuits and seek careers
only in the army, the church or in governmental po
sitions, long after the successful peoples had begun to
lay the foundation of their modern greatness on man
ufacture and commerce.
Lastly, that grasping rapacity, reaching out reck
lessly for all the gold there was in sight, which was
prominent among the qualities that first raised her
to a dominant position among the nations, was con
served as one of her main characteristics until com
plete poverty resulted from her very greed. So her
unwillingness, or inability, to change has brought this
wreck upon her. Perhaps degeneration is an inap
propriate word to apply to Spain â she has remained
as she was while others have gone ahead, and her
present plight is the inferiority of medievalism to
modern civilization.
It Is not to be wondered at that Spain should make
complaint as to the quality of the projectiles used by
our navy. It might also logically put up a note of
lamentation concerning the unfeeling accuracy with
which the projectiles are hurled.
Watson will doubtless soon put that third fleet
where critical inspection will require the use of a
diving suit.

A MISUNDERSTANDING.
To the Editor of The Call: In Justice
to Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald, I wish
to state regarding the mass-meeting held
at the Metropolitan Temple on Wednes
day evening, that the mistake was due
entirely to articles which have appeared
In the papers for the past week, due to
a misunderstanding on the part of the
reporters and not in any manner the fault
of the Labor Commissioner. He had noth
ing to do with the calling of the meeting,
and so stated to every one, and the work
ing women of thlÃ city know how hard
and faithfully he has worked for them,
and thank him with all their hearts for
what he has accomplished. The article
which appeared makes us seem guilty
of the basest Ingratitude instead of being
thankful. MRS. ANSELM.

\OLUNTEERS AND REGULARS.
When the mllltla boys went up to the j
fort they carried with them plenty of
ideas about what the regulars were going
to be like, and the regulars in their turn
were like a lot of schoolboys at the be
ginning of the term when the "new boys"
began to nock in. At present though the
rough edges of both sides have been
rubbed off. The volunteers have found
out that the regulars are a fine lot of
men, who know their business and have
gray matter under their campaign hats.
The regulars, too, have discovered that
the volunteers like the excitement of run
ning the guard as much as they do, and
that they also know how to grumble
and complain one moment and how to '
hurrah for their officers the next. That ;
is one of the first lessons the regular
learns, but his grumbling is "all in the |
family." If an outsider tries to make
remarks about the army to a regular
"doughboy," the man has a fight on his
hands.
The recruits of the Twenty-second were
a source of constant amusement to the '
regulars at Fort Slocum. They are used
to them now, though.
The first recruit was rather a surprise
to the regulars. He was dressed in
knickerbockers of the latest and most im
proved style, his mustache was nicely
curled and his stockings were fairly de
cent checker-boards. They thought ho
was a major general at least when ho
asked the way to regimental headquar
ters, and they all stood and saluted. The
next day a broad grin went around the
ftost when they found the major general
n an old suit of faded hhif nonchalantly
peeling potatoes in the kitchen and throw-
Ing in kindling wood. A few days later
they were even more astonished when

VOTING FOR ELECTORS-S. A. It,
City. The plan of voting for President of
the United States by electors was adopted
by the framers of the constitution to in
sure the action of the desire of the people
in the choice of their chief magistrate
without running the risk of a possible
revolution through popular excitement
over an unusually favorite candidate.
After a number of plans had been sug
gested it was thought best to give the
power into the hands of a limited num
ber of persons, chosen oy the people for
the sole purpose of making this selection.
Alexander Hamilton expressed it in these
words: "It was desirable that the sense
; of the people should operate In the choice
j of the persons to whom so important a
! trust was to be confided. It was equally
| desirable that the immediate election
j should be made by men most capable of
! analyzing qualities adapted to the sta
| tion. A small number of persons selected
by their fellow citizens from the general
I mass would be the most likely to possess
! the information and discernment neces
! sary for so complicated an investigation."
â  The idea was that the people would select
' their very best and wisest men as elec
i tors, and that they In turn, independent
lof any outside pressure, would sit in
. judgment upon the qualities and abilities
' of the foremost citizens of the republic
and choose from their number, not the
most popular man, but the man possessed
' of the highest qualifications for the office
to serve as President. To elect the Presi
dent by popular vote could be done only
by an amendment to the constitution.

GRIEF CRAZED
CARRIE SCHERR
Was Once a Handsome
Stylish Girl.
FOUND IN A FILTHY ABODE
BHE AND HER SISTER INDOORS
FOR THREE YEARS.
A, Family of Six Living in the
Foulest Place Ever Seen
by the Health
Officers.
A most Inexcusable and flagrant case
of neglect of a family of half-witted peo
ple came to the notice of the health of
ficials yesterday.
Police Officer John W. Butterworth of
the Health Department and Officer T. J.
Coleman visited the residence of a family
named Scherr in the forenoon for the pur
pose of investigating a report as to an
alleged case of Insanity, filth and neglect,
and found that the case was the worst
that had ever come under their observa
tion.
The family resides in a three-story bay
window house at 822 California street, on
the northwest corner of Prospect place.
The house adjoining, which is of the
same style of architecture and Is num
bered 824, is divided into three flats with ;
a basement, and is placarded to let.
Both these houses and another a block
or two away belong to the Scherr family,
the latter house being occupied by ten
ants of the Scherrs.
When the officers pained admission to
the house in the forenoon they found Car
rie Scherr, aged 40, clad only In a torn
and dirty shirt. lyinK On a thing which had
Borne time been v bed. The clothing was
black with ago ;m<] <lirt and grease. Al
bert, a stalwart brother of 3?. years, was
In the bousa i:i hia shirt sleeves prepar
ing a bucket of whitewash for the rented
houFe. The other occupants present were
a sister named Helen, 37 years old, and
Caroline, the mother, about 70.
After Carrie had hung a few dirty rag*
many methods of amusement to be
found at the Chutes, from the me
nagerie to the fat man, were largely
patronised; good humor and laughter
â were the order of the day, and the
policeman on duty found their posts
qultt- agreeable sinecures.
The chief interest of the afternoon
centered, of course,- in the pavilion,
where bunting of all colors Buttered
from the walls, and the French and
American flags, draped in brotherly
union, decorated the stage. The large
hall was crowded long before 2 o'clock,
but the audience was kept waiting a
tiresome time, until at last the presi
dent of the day, Monsieur Emmanuel
Raas. accompanied by quite a crowd
of swallow-tall-coated French citi
zens, made his appearance on the plat
form. Bennett's military band, which
provided gratuitous music, celebrated
the event by a joyful overture. The
Red Cross Society also showed its In
terest in the proceedings, the' presi
dent, Mrs. Harrington, and several
other prominent ladles connected with
the organization being placed in tho
front row on the stage.
The president's speech was com
mendably short, but it was well re
ceived by his hearers, most of whom
naturally understood the French lan
guage. He briefly dealt with the rea
sons which have made the Four
teenth of July a day dear to all
.Frenchmen, and showed how thor
oughly the French " colony of the
United States, dwelling in the midst
of prosperous industry, had a practi
cal illustration of the liberty won by
the French nation ever before them;
a daily example -of the strength,
wealth and power achieved by a race
governing itself. He expressed the
wish that the great cry of "Vive la
France" "would be continued In all
hearts with "Vive les Etats Unls,"
and that the two would blÂ»nd into
the one great cry, "Vive la repub
lique." The president also paid a
very handsome tribute to the Ameri
can army and gratefully acknowledged
the assistance which Its officers had
lent them in the organization of this
fete.
The French Consul General, M. Lau
rence de Lalanae. paid a similarly
warm tribute to the energy, aptitude
and efficiency of the- American race,
especially referring to the rapidity
with which a great army had just
upon herself she was questioned as to her
sanity by Health Officer Dr. Gallwey. She
was without shoes or stockings and the
black grime of years clung to her feet.
Her hair had been allowed to grow and
hung over her back like a black matted
bag. At first sight it looked as though
she was wearing a wig. but closer inspec
tion disclosed the fact that it was all her
own. foul and 111-smelling as It was. â¢
She was in keeping with her surround
ings. The once white plastered walls
were black and greasy. The floors, car
petless, were sticky with dirt and slippery
in places with candle Brrease an inch
thick. Al! the beds were black with dirt,
and the bedclothing was indescribable. It
had not been washed for years. All the
inside blinds were tightly closed, and the
air wns stuffy with an odor so vile that it
was almost torture to breathe it. It is
an astonishing thing that any one could
have lived for even twenty-four hours in
such an atmosphere. A ten-year-old hog
pen. in flytime, would be as the delicate
fragrance of violets compared with it.
There could be no doubt that the Scherrs
were immune. In this vile den, which was
all alike, upstairs and down, lived a fam
ily of six persons. Albert said that his
two brothers, Emil and Ferdinand, lived
there also, and that Kmil was a clerk in
the employ of the George H. Tay Com
pany.
In one of the upstairs rooms were sev
eral bushels of brown paper bags filled
with newspaper clippings yellow with age.
"They are newspaper articles on busi
ness matters " said Oarrte in reply to the
doctor, "i read them at. night before I
BO to bed, for I stay up tilM2 o'clock or
after and 1 sleep late the next day."
Outside of the dirt these bags of clip
pings were the only evidence of insanity.
The head of the family was a well
known and respectable dealer and specu
lator In malt, and he amassed considera
ble real estate, upon the proceeds of the
rental of which the family seem to be
living. During his lifetime his daughter
Carrie assisted him in his business and
accompanied him everywhere. She was a
line looking womarrr ulwayy richly and
stylishly dressed. Hr died a few years
ago, and Carrie, perhaps unhinged by sor
row, remained at home with her clippings
till the rags and filth grew upon her fcxtd
made her a shocking thing to look upon.
She told the doctor that she had not
stepped outside of the house for three
years. Why? "Because I got some splin
ters In my hands three years ago, and my
hands were so sore that I couldn't dress
myself to go out." As she spoke she held
up to the doctor a pair of black things
that she railed her hands. She wanted
to know why the police and the doctor
had come. It was a respectable house
and everybody in it was respectable, she
said, with some indignation, at the same
time opening to their fullest extent a pair
of iarge, light blue eyes, whose luster and
clearness not even the dirt of the family
abode could hide.
Sister Helen had not been outside for
three years. She did not want to go
tramping through the streets, because she
had no business there, and she was con
tent to remain where she was.
Albert, the able-bodied brother, ex
pressed his regret that the officers had
come If the dirt was all that was the
matter he would clean up the place, but
he required time. He was not crazy,
neither were his sisters. He seemed to
be oblivious of the fact that there was

ber of the French colony In this city
he took the opportunity of tendering
to tho people of the United States his
warmest sympathy and good wishes
for their success In the present con
flict. Further, he showed that the
French people had proved their kind
ly feeling to the United States in the
most practical of all ways by throw
ing open the doors of that splendid
( harit'y, the French Hospital, to the
Hick soldiers of the country, and grace
fully referring to the stars and stripes
and tricolor which were draped In
unison above his hfad, he expressed
the hope that this happy state of af
fairs would long continue, and that
the good pnns^ of both French and
American citizens' would forever pre
vent any serious difference of opinion
between" the nations.
By way of a change. Judge Troutt
dealt with the fall of the Bastile in
English, glorying in the greatness of
the event jtvhlch Frenchmen bo proud
ly and rightly celebrated. Naturally
the Jmli,'- could not long keep clear
of Spain Â«hd he turned his oratorical
guns, with terrible effect, upon the
Don. If words were cannon bails, the
war would be over by this time. Also
judge Troutt Undered the thanks of
the American nation to Dewey, Schley,
Sampson and many other of our na
tional heiyps, the French spirit of the
audience loudly applauding the men
tion of these noble names. The Fled
Cross Society also received its share
of thanks, the good work done ta.y the
noble women of new America and old
France, beinjf worthy of the highest
praise. The Judge, as a peroration,
quoted with great effect, the well
known words of Lincoln.
"Let us resolve that our honored
dead shall not have died In vain, tuid
that government of the peopl*. by the
pr-ople, for the people shall never per
ish from the earth."
.In.lged by the standard of eloquence
the best piece of oratory was delivered
by M. A. Gousteaux, who dealt with
the relations between the United
States and France in the same har
monious spirit of the Consul General.
The men who proclaimed the Inde
pendence of the United States were,
he considered, patriots worthy of the
highest honor. The result was that
the Union had never been more per
fect than to-day.
anything abnormal about his surround
lncs
Carrie was told that the doctor wanted
her to go with him to the rooms of the
Board of Health to have hmt hair cut and
shampooed. She demurred, saying that
she could cut her hair herself. She could
not shampoo or otherwise clean it because
it had become matted together and coulu
not be combed.
After much persuasion, she was Induc
ed to put on an old hat. a pair of stock
ings and shoes. Over her dirty tatters she
donned a sealskin cloak, reaching to her
ankles. The cloak had cost many hun
dreds of dollars when it was new, but
there were bald places in it and there
was a great rent in the sleeve. The poor
creature struggled twice on her way to
the patrol ambulance, which the doctor
called by courtesy his carriage, and she
was forced into It by two stalwart police
men from the California Street Station.
They took Helen with her, for she too
seemed to be weak minded, and brought
them to the City Receiving Hospital,
where they were given the first washing
they had had in years. To-day the mat
ter of their insanity an<T the disposition
to be made of them will be determined.
Officers Coleman and Butterworth said
that the Scherr home was- ths foulest
place they had ever seen.

For the first time In Its history, the
United States had departed from Its
peaceful policy and had astounded the
world by its brilliant successes. It hsrd
shown that it had a navy worthy of
comparison with that of the first Euro
pean powers, not in numbers, but in in
trinsic worth. Its armament was for
midable, and the military and naval
operations undertaken had been car
ried out with precision by worthy lead
ers. He advlsr-d Americans not to at
tach too much importance to the Ir
responsible utterances of some French
journalists, and pointed out that Gen
eral Porter, the United States Embas
sador at Paris, was <? much better
judge of the feelings of the French na
tion. The general recently honored the
memory of Lafayette by unfurling the
star spangled banner over his tomb.
The Frencn nearly as a whole honored
and loved the United States, and
Frenchmen were convinced that wher
ever the American people went there
were Implanted the seeds of trude and
of liberty.
The mtiplcal portion of tho pro
gramme was pretty equally balanced
between Frencn and American nation
al airs. The greatest success of the
day was Medame Annis Montague-

rendered our soldiers. .
The scene was even livelier during
the evening, for speeches and song
gave way to fireworks and frolic. Ev

SHE IS A DIFFERENT WOMAN.
, . " f . V v,-.- , .. â¢ UKIAH. Cal., July 9, 1898,
DR. SANDENâ Dear Sir: I have worn your belt since the 4th of June. The
morning I first put it on my back was so lame I could hardly walk, and could not
lift a dipper of water without pain. In less than an hour after putting the Belt on
I could carry ': a bucket of water across the room without any pain. I swept the
house and_worked all day, and In three days from that time I did a two weeks' wash-
ing, working all day, and did not feel tired at night. That was the first time I was
able to do any washing since the Ist of January, but have worked every day since.
Before wearing your Belt I had not been able to run the machine or sew by hand,
but now I can run the machine and sew all day : without feeling tired. I sleep well
BÂ«d am not a bit nervous, like I used to be. The Belt has done wonders for me, and
I tell all my friends about the good it has done me. I can gladly say that I am well
of all the complaints I had, which- were many, and wish I could persuade all )adlea
suffering as I was to get one of your Belts, for I am sure they will do all you claim.
I shall always feel thankful for the benefits I have received from your Belt. With
kind regards, MRS. D. E. PAXTON.
IT IS A GRAND REMEDY.
Women, do not suffer from weakness, pains ami nervousness, when :
you can be cured, and without' drugging your stomach. ÂM ake a change
now You will live longer if you take less medicine. A mild, soothing
and invigorating warmth of electricity from Dr. Sanden's Belt will cure
you: Call or send for book free.

LEES CASTS
MANY LARGE
BOUQUETS
AH Directed His Way,
However.
TELLS OF WEBER'S MURDER
HE, HE SAYS. NO ONE ELSE, DE
SERVES ALL CREDIT.
"Worked TJp One of the Most Re
markable Cases That Ever
Occurred in This
State."
"Mr. Kovaiev was never brought In for
the murder of the Webers; he was brought
in for the San Jose highway robbery busi
ness, and he was only charged with the
murder of Mr. Weber after I had worked
up a very strong and one of the most re
markahle cases that ever occurred in this
State."
The above is a mild sample of many
brilliant bouquets Chief of Police Lees
hurled at himself yesterday, when on the
witness stand in l>ehalf of the State in the
action instituted by John J. O'Malley, as
assignee of "Wladislaw Zakrewskei, to re
cover $1000, the amount of the reward of â¢
fered by Governor Markham for the de
tection and conviction of the murderer of
H. L. Weber and his wife, Lizzie M. We
ber.
If the Chief fails to knit toother and
patch up the ragged ends of his fame and
incidentally prevent Zakrewskei, the aged
carpenter, from collecting the reward that
In justice belongs to him no one can seri
ously hold him to account. He is at pres
ent manifesting more life and spending
more ill-directed energy in an effort to
accomplish that purpose that the motive
seems to justify, but Lees hasn't much
time left to him and he must make hay
while the sun shinesâ patch up his fame,
or go down in history as a scintillating ex
emplification of the "false alarm."
His effort on the stand yesterday bore
all the ear marks of a studied recitation,
badly gotten up in the first place and
poorly learned. The Chief had quite a
struggle finding space, time and glowing
terms sufficient to portray the majestic
opinion he holds of himself, but he did
fairly well for one of his decaying mental
faculties. â¢
Leea was anxious to get on the stand
and he had no sooner reached the witness
chair than he began to tell his story,
coupled with several verbal bouquets and
as a iinis a tale of woe.
"I made the arrests in these cases my
self," he began.
This was a piece of information none
had looked for, but a surprise is always
refreshing, su none commented. Latei ,
however, when the Chief probably forgot
that he had made the statement that he
had arrested the criminal himself,- he vol- |
unteered the information that he was the
man who served the warrant on Kovalev
for the Weber murders several days after
Kovalev had been arrested. Later he dis
covered his mistake and said that Kovalev
had been originally jailed on suspicion of
having participated in the highway rob
bery of William Doteman of San Jose.
Lees, of course, accenting to his testi
mony, was the man whs' ferreted the pris
oner out and laid the hand of the law
upon him.
The forgetful witness then told how he
had "worked up the case" against
Kovalev, and how he had ordered two of
his famed satellites to go forth and bring
in four men, among them Kovalev and
Zakrewskei, the claimant for the reward,
all bping suspected of connection with
"the San Jose business."
When the Chief referred to the re
ward there was a melancholy discord in
his voice. He told an acquaintance that
the reward matter did not Interest him at
all. "I v.-as anxious to unearth this mat
ter in Sacramento," he said, "and the
matter of the reward, after the expenses
were paid out of it, did not interest me
at all."
This confession is interesting to all who
are in possesfon of the facts and remem
ber with smiles the last scramble the
head of the department made to collect
the reward he did not earn. Lees next
referred to his gront generosity in the in
terest of justiceâ how he had personally
paid the expenses of his detectives as
they prowled about the country in search
of clewÃ, and from this city to Sacramen
to several times during the trial. This
memory seemed to pain the Chief and
on that strain he continued. "The
Board of Examiner^ awarded me the
money. I sued for it in the Superior
Court. I was awarded the money. The
case went to the Supreme Coijrt, and
upon questions of law I was beaten."
Such is his story of how the award
slipped through his fingers, and now he
has joined the forces against the old car
penter to defeat it possible the man who
tried toâ help him build a reputation.

BARBER FOR GOVERNOR GENERAL OF HAWAII
Regulars Embarkâ Ships in the Stream Ready to
Sail To-day-New York Regiment Goes
to the Presidio.
IT has been practically decided to
appoint Colonel T. 11. Barber of the
First New York Regiment Military
Governor of the Hawaiian Islands.
The appointment, however, will be
only temporary, for Colonel Harber was
yesterday assured that the First will go
to the Philippines as soon as it is pos
sible for the War Department to relieve
them of garrison duty at Honolulu.
I,atÂ« yesterday afternoon Colonel
Barber received a number of telegrams
from Washington. After toying with
the wires for a few moments the col
onel went out to Camp Merritt. He
v.rs In the best of humor. Approach-
Ing Lieutenant Colonel Stacpole he
Batd. "Colonel, we may yet go to the
Philippines." When asked for an ex
planatio.i Colonel Harber stated that
he had received assurances from Wash
ington that the First New York Volun
teers would not be compelled to perma
nently remain on garrison duty at Hon
olulu.
"I have been assured," he said, "that
my regiment will ultimately go to Ma
nila, Six companies will leave here on
transports for Honolulu about July 30.
Th* remaining six companies will start
for the islands August 12. Our stay
there I believe will be only temporary.
As soon as it is convenient to send re
inforcements we will go to the Philip
pines."
"When asked if his duties would be
more than military Colonel Barber
said: "I understand that 1 am to be
practically the Military Governor of the
islands until such time as a suitable
government can be established on a
permanent baMS. So far as 1 can see
my position will be something like that
of General Merritt, only, of course, on
a smaller scale. I will in all likelihood
have considerable civil as well as mili
tary duty to perform."
The news of the favorable chances
of the First going to Manila has creat
ed the greatest enthusiasm among the
officers and men.
When the First New York Volunteers
left th'-ir native State it was with the ;
assurance that their destination was
the Philippine islands. Before leaving |
San Francisco Major General Wesley j
Merritt sent a personal request to
President McKirtfey to have the First ;
New Y<>rk Volunteers assigned to ac- ;
tive duty in the Department of the Pa- .
cine, of which he is commander. Col- I
onel Barber and General Merritt are
old friends. The request of General
Merritt to have the First New York as- i
elgn-d to his command was immediate- !
ly granted, and when the regiment
wheeled out of Jersey City a week ago
yesterday it was understood their des
tination was Manila.
Colonel Barber had received assurances
from the administration that the m<-n
under his command would go to the
Philippines just a-s soon as the department
quartermaster here was able to charter
the necessary transports. It was under
stood that h*e could not go with the ex- i
pedltion that embarked yesterday, owing
to the uncertainty of the time of trans
portation across the continent.
Last Friday afternoon word was re- '
reived on the train that the adjutant gen
era! had assigned the First New "^ork
Volunteers to garrison duty at Honolulu. ;
Colonel Barber is too good a soldier to ;
take Issue with his Buperior officers. He j
made no complaint whatever at the sud
den turn of affairs. The enlisted men
were quite heartbroken. Practically every
man in the regiment had given up a good
position in hopes of Beeing active service.
The nearest approach to actual warfare
that could be hoped for in the Hawaiian
Islands would be tho regulation garrison
drill.
On his arrival here Wednesday after
noon Colonel Barber received a number
of personal telegrams from Washington
nnd New York. He refused to make pub
lic the nature of their contents. When the
ramp site of the New York Volunteers
at the old Bay District ra-cetraek was des
ignated to him he openly manifested his
displeasure. The place is one stretch of
dry sand, mixed with debris ;md decayed
matter. He immediately called the atten
tion of Surgeon Davis to the condition of
the site, and after a brief examination
the doctor stated that a permanent en
campment at the place allotted to the
First New York would be a menace to the
health of the men.
Yesterday morning Colonel Harber
called on General Otis at his headquarters
in the Phelan building and laid the matter
before him. The regiment had already
pitched its conical tents in the miniature
riesert, and, notwithstanding the great In
convenience that would result in the
breaking tip of the ramp. Colonel Barber
requested General Otis to permit his regi
ment to move their tents to the Presidio
reservation. General Otis granted the re
quest and this morning at sunrise the
First ' New York will br.-nk camp at the
old Bay District track and reopen house
nt the Government reservation
Army officers speak of the First New
York as "volunteer regulars." It was the
first and in fact, the only regiment that
left New York or any other Eastern State
fully equipped for service. The only draw
hack in the equippage is the antique rifles
â¢with which the men have been supplied.
Like all of the volunteer regiments, the
First New York is armed with Springfield
rifles which long ago outlived tlx-ir use
fulness, so far as modern warfare is con
cerned. They are only effective at short
range, and other things being equal,
would be no match for the Mauser rifles
with which the Spanish and all European
soldiers are armed, or the Crag-Jorgenson
which is now the regulation weapon of
the United States army.
Just before being appointed to active
field service Brigadier General Royal T.
Frank, commander of the Department of
the East, the most Important military
command of the United Statin, after an
official inspection of the First New York
Volunteer?, prodalme^nhem the equal of
any regiment of regulars In the service.
There is more wealth and Influence rep
resented by the First New York Volun-,
tpern than by any other regimental body
of troops In the service. Among the pri
vates are ycinns of the wealthiest New
York families. Many of them are men of
pronounced social cast and belong to tho
ultra-fashioniible or "smart set" of the
metropolis. Colonel T. 11. Barber Is on
of tin: wealthiest men in the State of New
York. He lives during part of the year at
Albany, the State capltol, where his In
terests are very great. Lieutenant Colo
nel H. C. Stacpole has bef n for thirty-one
years in the adjutant general's office of
the State.
Major Robert Emmet Is nlso a man of
preat wealth. He has a splendid estate at
Port Cluster. Just outside the city limits
of Greater New York. For fifteen years
he was in the regular army rind when he
threw nn his commission was a captain
In the Ninth Cavalry. He is the great
grandnephew of Robert Emmet, one of
the most picturesque heroes in Irish his
tory. Major Emmet bears a striking re
semblance to his illustrous ancestors.
Lieutenant Brownson Wlnthrop, quar
termaster of the regiment, Is a member of
the famous Wlnthrop family, one of the
most pronounced social factors in New
York. Ho Ib an associate of Ellhu Root,
the New York attorney. Previous to en
listing. Lieutenant Winthron never did
anything, aside from his legal duties,
more fatiguing than to lead a german or
see that a lady was properly served with
Ices during a function of the "400." But
he wanted to be soldier, and since he has
bpen a quartermaster, has done every
thing from an official inspection of pick
handles to counting the cannon balls on
Governors Island.
Captain Frank R. Palmer, Company A,
Is the son of Albany's leading banker.
Dr. L. T. Griffiths, the assistant surgeon,
is the son of Judge Griffiths of Troy, who
wields more Influence over Governor
Black than does ex-Senator T. C. Platt,
the admitted Republican leader of the
Empire State.
Lieutenant James Smith of Company
D Is a prominent physician of Albany,
and Lieutenant Clarence Stevell, the ad
jutant, is a well-known llgure in New
York society.
But In the First New York social eclat
and financial atlluence are not confined
to the commissioned officers. Among the
privates there are many influential citi
zens of New York.
Corporal Amos Potter is the son of the
late Brownson Potter, banker. and
nephew of Bishop Potter. He is a young
man with a decided appreciation and love
of the humors of life. As soon as he en
listed he bought a bear as a mascot for
Company A. Thinking that beef and such
was not equal to the task of nourishing
the beast, he purchased a large supply
of honey with which to feed the bear.
After one application the mascot went
Into a state of unconsciousness for twen
ty-four hours. Corporal Potter amuses
himself by buying 50-cent cigars for his
brother privates and "various brands of
champagne for the non-commissioned of
ficers.
Another luminary In tho ranks of the
First New York Is Corporal Will L. Mar
tin of Company H. lie Is a nephew of
Bradley Martin, whose costume ball in
New York a couple of years ago created
the greatest social sensation in recent
years.
John Grant, another private of the New
York Volunteers, is a State Senator of
the Empire State. With a number of
men In his regiment lie was offered and
refused commissions in other regiments
destined to the fate of home guard duty.
The officers and men of the First New
York were gratified yesterday morning
over the public reception and breakfast
tendered them by former residents of the
Empire State at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
It was beyond Question one of the most
successful demonstrations in honor of the
volunteers that has been given in this :
country since the declaration of hostili
ties.
Some one asked Colonel Barber why the
Government went to the expense of trans
porting his regiment away across the con- j
tlnent to sail for Manila when a regiment j
could have been obtained near San Fran
cisco. Colonel Barber thought a moment
and then related a story which, he sain, |
had never been told before. He said that
while the regiment was in camp at Hemp
stead General Merritt. then commanding
the Department of the East, visited the :
camp. He inspected the regiment, saw it
drill, noticed the discipline, and then said
to Colonel Barber:
"Barber, I'm a little particular about ]
the troops I take to Manila, but that n-gi
ment will do me. 1 want It there and am
Ruing to ask the department for It."
The request was almost immediately
sent in and was granted.
GOING TO HONOLULU.
Johnson-Locke Company Has
Contracted to Transport the
New York Regiment.
Unless the order is revoked, the First
Regiment of New York Volunteers will
be sent to Honolulu to garrison the post
that is to be established there by Major
General Otis on his way to Manila. The
question of transportation has been
troubling the military authorities until j
yesterday, when a contract was closed
with the Johnson-Locke Mercantile Com- j
pany by which that firm agrees to carry
the New Yorkers to Honolulu for a stip
ulated Bum per man, the food to be in
cluded. What the price Is has not be-n
n^ad.' public. Under the contract the
Johnson-Locke Mercantile Company is to ;

THE PASSING REGIMENTS.
Regulars March Through the
City to Embark â Volunteer
Battalions Arrive.
Again the streets of San Francisco havo
presented a warlike panorama of boy.'- la
blue marching away to war. Again tho
tramp of many feet, the passing of long
columns of soldiers and the stirring
strains of martial music have quickened
the pulse and strengthened the loyalty of
thosa who remain at home. Tho scenes
upon the streets of the city yesterday
were such as caused an Inspiration in the
hearts of those that witnessed them such
as cannot be forgotten or obliterated in
the years to come.
The troops composing the fourth expe
dition to Manila have gone aboard their
transports, and, should no orders to the
contrary be given, to-day they will sail
through the Golden Gate and over the sea
to accept with soldierly fortitude and
bravery whatever fate awaits them in the
foreign clime where they go to defend the
: honor of the national flag. In a way, yes
terday's scenes were unique in the history
lof the city. Every branch of the regular
\ service was represented by the departing
; troopsâ something that has not occurred
i with any of the former expeditions that
have left hereâ while, at the name time that
the fourth expedition forces were march
ing to their transports another body of
soldiers, the flower and pride of the lore
1 most State in the L'nlon. came marching
into the city to take the place of those
that have gone and to await their turn
, to go to the far Orient.
In consonance with former demonstra
: lions upon such occasions, the citizens of
San Francisco turned out in generous
numbers to give the parting troops a royal
send-off and to wish them bon voyage and
godspeed on their journey. At an early
hour the crowd began to gather on Mar
! ket street and along Golden Gate aveirtrj
' and Post street. They hud not long to
wait, for at 8 o'clock Companies A, B, L),
I, X and L of the First New York Kegl
1 ment, which had remained at Oakland
\ over night, landed at the ferry, under the
â  oommand of Lieutenant Colonel Stacpole,
where they were met by the band of tho
! First Tennessee Regiment and escorted to
ith Mechanics' Pavilion. There they were
: given a reception by the committee of
New York citizens and also a hearty
; breakfast. The New York boys were ac
i corded a royal ovation as they marched
up Market street, and they presented a
magnificent appearance. At the Pavilion
I they were joined by the other two de
tachments of the regiment that came over
:on Wednesday. This detachment consist
ed of Companies C, K. F, G, H and M,
under the command of Colonel Barber,
and they were escorted from Camp Mer
ritt by the band of the Seventh California
Regiment. After the reception at the
Pavilion the regiment as a whole marched
back to camp.
The live companies of the Fourteenth
Infantry, under the command of Major
Robe, received a grand ovation along the
entire line of their march to their trans-
I port, the Puebla. which was at the Pacl
1 nes Mail dock. The companies formed a
battalion, and they wore their brown can
, vas uniforms, which lent a certain rough
; and rugged dignity to the men. They
i looked as if they were ready for work
j and war alike, and they mnrched with
i the precision of regulars. From the camp
! they came down Post street to Market,
i and were immediately followed by the re
cruits of the Twenty-third Infantry, un
der the command of Lieutenant Munton.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 15, 1898.
quarters on Post street, between Kearny
and Market, they gave a rousing cheer
for the noble women who have done so
much for them, und there was an un
spoken volume of gratitude In the way
those soldiers gave that cheer. The de
tachment of the Third I'nlted States Ar
tllley, under Second Lieutenant Aber
nethy, proceeded down Golden Gate ave
nue to Sixth street and thence down Fol
som street to the wharf.
The chief and greatest event of the day
was the departure of the six troops of the
Fourth Cavalry, under the command of
Colonel K>'llogg. The people of San
Francisco have a warm spot In their
hearts for the Fourth, for in the many
years that it has been stationed here at
the Presidio officers and men alike have
endeared themselves to the residents, and
more than one among those who marched
h.i bravely through the streets claim the
Golden State as their homo.
It was not iiuite 10 o'clock when the
troops turned Into Van Ness avenue. As
the troops turned Into the avenue there
was a roll of the drum, a crash of the
cymbal and in an instant a blare of the
horns playing a lively two-step. The
crowd caught the yplrit of the moment
and cheers for the Fourth, good-by and
God bless you came from the throats of
the thousands that lined the pavements.
At Golden Gate avenue the platoon for
mation was reduced to a troop column
of fours, and on down between the long
line of surging nnd narrowing humanity
the cavalrymen marched. A veritable
wave of cheers that drowned the music of
the band swept in advance of the men
like some mighty avalanche of sound. It
was deafening. Inspiring and wonderful.
Flags were waxed from windows, women
fluttered their handkerchiefs wet with
their tears, while stern men threw their
lints into the air and wondered why their
eyes were moist and why they spoke with
a huÃklness in their voices.
Along Market street the demonstration
was even more pronounced, and when
Third street was reached the crowd was
so great that it was with the greatest dif
ficulty that the men were able to force
their way between the sea of people anx
ious to render their mite of homage and
eager to catch a last glimpse. Thus the
Fourth psssed through the streets of San
Francisco followed by the cheers and
prayers of the restless multitude.
SCENES AT THE DOCK.
Shortly After the Troops Em
barked the Ships Swung In
to the Stream.
There were not as many people down
to the Pacific Mail and Oceanic com
panies' wharves when the regulars ar
rived as on former occasions, nor was
there quite as much enthusiasm. When
the soldiers marched on to the wharves
and were dismissed the work of putting
their belongings aboard was begun at
once. Some of the men tried to get out
of the shed In order to take a farewell
glass with th*-Ir friends, but when the
officers found out what was going on they
at once placed sentries to keep the sol
diers In check.
On the Mail dock a cordon of sentries
was placed, but the men managed to
elude them. A narrow passageway runs
along the outside of the shed and by it
the men passed to the upper part of the
wharf and thus out on Brannan street.
where they got the much-coveted drink.
At 3:30 p. m. all this was stopped by the
men being ordered aboard and at 4 p. m.
the transports Peru and City of Puebla
dropped into the stream. Both vessels
will remain under steam and will be
ready for a start any time to-day.
The transposed revenue cutter Grant
was also ordered to get ready to sail at
once under sealed orders, but yesterday
thf-se were countermanded und it will
now be a couple of days before she will
leave port.
The transport Rio de Janeiro finished
coaling yesterday and the Pennsylvania
will finish to-day. Both steamers will be
ready to sail for Manila the first of next
week. A double force of men are at
work on the ship Tacoma, but It will be
a fortnight before she can get away. She
will take forty-eight cavalrymen and 250
horses and six months' supplies down to
the Philippines.
In order to accommodate the. horses
stalls are being built on the upper deck
and also in the 'tween decks. An extra
donkey engine and condensers are being
put In and the water will be piped all
through the ship. A skilled "vet" will
accompany the expedition and Lieutenant
Cameron says that he Is confident the
horses will reach Manila In safety.
The steamer St. Paul, which Is to form
one of the next fleet, has not arrived yet
from St. Michael. She is due now at any
time, and as she will not require much
altering she should be ready almost as
soon as the Rio and Pennsylvania.
THE HARBOR MINES.
Major Heuer Says They Will
Not Be Blown Off Like a Lot
of Firecrackers.
No instructions have been received by
Major William H. Heuer, of the corps of
engineers, in charge of harbor mines, to
remove the mines in the bay of San Fran
cisco, and until he gets orders to act In
the matter, they will remain there.
"In case 1 am directed to remove theÃe
mines," said Major Heuer yesterday aft
ernoon, "I shall certainly not do so by ex-
Elodlng them, as they are too valuable to
c blown off like a lot of firecrackers. I
shall simply disconnect the electric ap
paratus at the shore, and grapple for the
mines, which will be stored away for an
other war. No recommendations have yet
been asked for from me, and until they
are called for I shall make none. What
my recommendations will be I decline to
THE FIFTH EXPEDITION.
First Montana and First South Dakota
Volunteers, Together With Recruits, Will
Comprise the Brigade.
Major General Otis yesterday Issued the following orders, designating the troops to sail, and their trans
ports, on the fifth expedition that will leave on the 21st lnst. :
8. The following designated troops of the command will be placed In readiness to embark for the Philippine Isl
ands on steamers hereinafter named by Thursday next, the 21st inst., and are assigned to transports as follows:
To the steamer Pennsylvania, the First Montana Volunteers and recruits of the First California

First and Second Battalions of the Eighteenth United States Infantry, Signal Corps detachment, consist
ing of three officers and thirty men, and recruits of the Utah Light Artillery.
To the steamer St. Paul, one battalion South Dakota Volunteers, recruits of First Colorado Vol
unteers, recruits of Thirteenth Minnesota Volunteers and Signal Corps detachment, consisting of two
officers and twenty enlisted men.
Brigadier General H. G. Otis will accompany the expedition and will assume full command. He has not
yet selected the vessel upon which he will sail, but will report to the commanding general of Camp Merritt.
OLD WOODLAND COMPANY.
Thirty Comrades Rally to the Defense of
Private Dungan and Define
His Position.
To the Editor of The Call: In justice to our esteemed comrade and fel
low-citizen, Mr. Dungan, us well as to ourselves and the honor of the old
company, we would most respectfully deny each and every accusation which
has appeared over the signature of the "scabby eight." In the first place
It is a fact that several of those signatures would never have appeared or
Company M's roll If we had been allowed to take our oath of allegiance.
Only one of them ever was a member of Company Fâ Private Holt â and tc
prove the high esteem In which he was held by his comrades, he was, by a
two-thirds vote, dishonorably discharged from the service of the State; and
we think If his record in the United States Infantry is looked into by Lieu
tenant Colonel Carrlngton It will be found to be anything but creditable.
Some of tne other signatures belong to men who. to put It "light," belong
to the great "army of the unemployed," and have no residence here, and
are hardly the kind of people whose statement, not only besmirching an
Individual but a whole company, will be given much serious consideration by
those who know the facts.
Editor Dungan was one of our most enthusiastic volunteers. He never
In any way tried to influence our opinion, and seldom expressed his own. In
presenting our mascot to Company E, which he did after repeated calls had
been made on him, he referred to the seceders as the "measley eight,"
and in those two words He the whole feeling which has been expressed in
to-day's Call, In which they give vent to their personal feelings by trying
to vilify an honorable and patriotic man in discharging the duties which he
owes to his country and his flag. If we did not feel sure that In answering
these allegations we are discharging a duty we owe to Mr. Dungan, the
source from which they emanated would have kept us from paying any
attention to the biased opinion of eight men as against 100. But, no doubt,
they are only the tools of some of Budd's political machines. There never
was at any time any necessity of an agitator, as the unanimous verdict
of the company, without any agitating, was carried out, and upheld by our
citizens when we returned home.

been ordered to sail to-day on the
City of Puebla.
The gunboat Bennlngton hove up
her anchor at 3:30 p. m. yesterday
and went to sea. Lieutenant Com
mander Moser was the only man
aboard who knew her destination,
and he would not tell. All the offi
cers were In Ignorance of her des
tination, but many of them seemed
to think that she waa going to
Alaska to relieve the Wheeling,
which has been more than her limit
of time in that station. When the
gunboat got outside she was head
ed northwest, and while that would
be her course for Alaskan waters,
it would also be the great circle
route for the Ladrones and Philip
pines. Every man Jack on the war
ship was hoping that the latter
place la her destination.
NEW YORK BREAKFAST.
The First Regiment of New York Volun
teers, which arrived in San Francisco In
two flections, several hours part, had a
rousing reunion and royal reception yes
terday morning at the Mechanics' Pavil
ion. Companies A, B, C, D, E and V
reached the city early yesterday morning,
and upon Invitation of a committee of
native New Yorkers, marched to the Pa
vilion, where they found awaiting them
the other companies of the regiment
which had preceded them the night be
fore.
The committee had prepared fro them a
substantial and inviting breakfast, which
was spread upon fourteen lone tables. The
attendants upon the tables were nearly
all native New York ladies, luid were un
der thÂ«- direction of Mrs. Klnne, wife of
Colonel C. Mason Klnne.
After listening to a brief but most en
joyable concert by the bands of the First
Tennessee and the Seventh California
Regiments, the New York Volunteers took
seats at the tables, and were soon doing
ample Justice to the menu, which Included
chicken fricassee with new potatoes,
prime foast beef with green peas, bread
and butter, olives, cheese. ice-cream
strawberries and cream, fruit and coffee
After breakfast all forrnalties were dis
pensed with, and "a Jolly good time" fol
lowed. There was no speech making but
round after round of cheers waa given to
the ladies of the city of San Francisco,
the State of California, the Empire State
âNew \ork. Uncle Sam, General Barnes
and a host of others, after which the New
Workers fell Into line and marched to
Camp Merrltt.
FOURTH U. V CAVALRY.
Embarkation of the Gallant Six
Hundred Troopers of Colonel
Kellogg's Command.
It would be difficult to find in the
Tinted States regular army a finer body
of men than the cavalry comand of Col
onel Sanford C. Kellogg. The command,
which Is now on board the steamer Peru
to sail for Manila to-day, consists of six
troops of the Fourth Cavalry Regiment,
and Is largely composed of recruits from
California and the Pacific Coast generally.
Neatly all are young men of eminently
respectable families, in perfect health and
In every way well fitted for military
service. Ever since recruiting began for
this regiment the greatest care has been
taken to select from the large number of
applicants only the best men, both as to
physical qualities and intelligence com
bined with moral character. The fact
that there has not been found a drunken
man in the command is a record reflecting
credit not only upon the organization but
upon the recruiting officers for the ef
llcient manner in which they have per
formed their duty. It ia gratifying to
know that great watchfulness is now ex
ercised In the enlistment of recruits in the
regular army, which In recent years has
been brought up to a very high standard
in every respect. An evidence of this is
the excellent behavior of the regular
troops that have recently been concen
trated in San Francisco.
It was at 8 o'clock yesterday morning
that the signal to strike tents way
sounded at the Presidio for Colonel Kel
logg's command. They all came down
with a rush, everything moving like clock
work. The sudden collapse of the tented
city was an interesting sight, and was
witnessed by a large number of specta
tors, many of whom had come to the Pre
sidio to bid good-by to relatives and
friends in the ranks.
As usual upon such occasions there were
many fond and touching farewells. God
bless-yous, and au revolrs, sandwiched
now and then with a copious flow of
tears.
At 9 o'clock the assembly was sounded
and the line was formed with its right
resting at the old Light Battery barracks
on the old parade ground facing west. The
formation of the line, composed of Troops
G, X, I, E, Li and C, in the order named,
occupied but a few minutes the evolution
being performed promptly and with great
precision.
Formed in four platoons of five eotÃ of
fours each, the column of the six troops
was given the command to march, and
upon reaching the roadway, swung in be
hind the regimental band and Troop B,
which had been detailed to act aa an es
cort. The twenty-two members of the
band, under the leadership of Bandmaster
Littleton, were mounted on fine white
horses of uniform size, and the members
of Troop B, in command of Lieutenant

Neall. rode handsome bays, all the ani
mals being as perfectly drilled as the sol
diers. Colonel Kellogg and his staff, all
riding high-spirited but graceful steppers,
were at the head of the command.
The column, keeping step to the martial
and inspiriting music, followed the wind
ing road to the gate of The Presidio, be
ing heartily cheered by the battalion of
the Second Regiment of the United States
Volunteer Engineers and by the artillery
battrries remaining at Camp Miller,
these organizations having been drawn
up in line along the roadside to give the
boys an enthusiastic farewell sendoff.
No body of troops ever presented a liner
military appearance than Colonel Kel
lcgg's command of six hundred cavalry
men as It left the Presidio and marched
down Lombard street to Van Ness avenue,
and thence to the Pacific Mail dock. The
admiring crowds along the line of march
were most generous in their cheers, and
it was with evident pride and satisfac
tion that Colonel Kellogg occasionally
turned in his saddle and looked back at
his gallant and well-trained little army
as it passed through the throngs on Mar
ket street.
THE KANSAS CAMP.
Location Condemned by the
Regimental Surgeon â Trans
fer to the Presidio Desired.
Surgeon Major Rafter, regimental sur
geon of the Twentieth Kansas, has con
demned the location of the Kansas camp
and asks that the command be moved to
some locution less Inimical to general
health.
For a week past Surgeon Rafter has
been making careful and thorough inves
tigation into the sanitary condition of the
camp. The men have occupied the same
space for over seven weeks, a longer
period than regular army authorities con
sider safe. The lot is lined on the east by
a row of covered and uncovered sinks, trie
water and refuse from company kitchens
of necessity lies and festers under the
nostrils of the whole command. Tne
formation of the lot is such that as much
of this disease-breeding muck as the
spungy sand can absorb drains down into
the center of the camp. Surgeon Rafter
says that the whole place is little better
than one bier "germ culture."
This opinion, coupled with a recom
mendation to move the camp, he has put
into vigorous English and has addressed
it to Colonel Funston and the colonel has
started It through the regular channels
toward the head of the department.
It is the desire of the entire command
that they be transferred to the Presidio,
as the rapidly increasing sick list is
alarming them all lest a serious epidemic
break out.
SIXTH ARTILLERY.
Batteries D and G, in Command
of Major Grugan, Go on
Board the Peru.
Light Batteries D and O of the Sixth
Artillery left Camp Miller at the Presidio
at 9 oclock yesterday morning and rode
in the Union-street cable-cars down to
Montgomery street, where they formed in
line and marched to the Pacific Mail dock,
there embarking on the Peru. Battery
P'b officers are Captain A. B. Dyer,
Lieutenants Hawthorne, Fleming and
Scott. The officers of Battery G are Cap
tain V. H. Brldgman. Lieutenants
Ostheim, E. D. Pearce and F. A. Pearce.
The former has 129 men and the latter 146.
The battalion is In command of Major F.
C. Grugan, under whose direction the
men will give a good account of them
selves, as he 1b a thorough soldier. Dr.
Clarence Qulnan is the surgeon of the
command.
FOUND A BAD MAN.
Private Miller of Montana Sent
to Alcatraz for a Term of
Two Years.
George W. Miller, a private of Com
pany L, First Montana, escaped from the
guardhouse on Friday night last and bar
ricaded himself against the officer of the
guard and a squad of men in the bath
room of a saloon just across from the
camp on Point Lobos avenue. With the
assistance of the keeper of the place he
succeeded In holding off the guard until
the door was broken down and until by a
well directed blow from the officer of the
guard he was knocked into a bathtub.
He quickly gained his feet and aa
. saulted his superior in a murderous man-
I ner. and it was with a great deal of diffi
culty that he was finally overcome.
Miller was up before the general court
martial on Monday on charges of as
saulting an officer and general insubor
dination. His trial developed that he was
| the worst character in the regiment, hav
ing been in the guardhouse nearly every
day since his enlistment. He was sen-
I tenced to two years at hard labor at Al
! catraz and to forfeit all pay and allow-
I ances. He was escorted to the island last
I evening by a squad of men from his reel-
I ment.

THE SAX FKAKCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 15, 1898.
HUNDREDS SING "DIXIE" AND CHEER FOR THE FLAG.
Tennessee Boijs Drill Before a Large Audience at the Pavilion.
The exhibition drill given at the Pavilion last evening by the First Tennessee Regiment, under the auspices and for
the benefit of the Army Christian Commission, was a success. ThÂ« military evolutions of the boys in blue were perfect,
far beyond comment, and merited the praise usually extended to the soldiers of the regular army.
The welcome the boys received at the instant they entered the Pavilion clearly demonstrated the patriotic esteem
In which they are held in the minds of those for whom they have enlisted and for whom they are ready to sacrifice life
and worldly interest. The formality and diffidence with which the general citizen is usually hampered in public in the ex
pression of his thoughts and feelings were cast aside and lost In the enthusiasm that the scene before him evoked. The
old historic building echoed and re-echoed with the deafening cheers and bravos that followed in the wake of the per
fect execution of every command. Women came bedecked with every conceivable emblem of patriotism, from a modest
presentation of a miniature flag affixed to their bodices to a dress composed of an entire American flag.
The regiment, preparatory to its assemblage in the Pavilion, was organized in regular order at the corner of Mc-
Allister and Larkin streets, the place appointed, whence, led by the colonel and staff of the regiment, It marched to tho
entrance to the Pavilion.
Upon arrival there the regiment lined up in battalions and was reviewed by General Charles King and staff, after
which the programme of the evening was announced.
Theodore F. Burnham, who acted as president of the evening, in the absence of General W. H. L. Barnes, opened
the exercises by delivering a short address on the subject of the war with Spain and the loyalty of the American soldier.
Upon the conclusion of the panegyric the regimental band rendered the Initial musical selection of the programme, "Dixie."
Tho old familiar tune was met with a burst of applause from every nook and corner of the entire building. People rose In
their seats and waved handkerchiefs and flags, cheering until the last strains of old "Dixie" were lost In an echo and
drowned in the shrill command to march, which was taken up and passed rapidly along the line.
Upon the conclusion of the programme the boys were feasted by the Mothers' Club of the Army and Navy Chris
tian Commission, under the direction of President Mrs. C. S. Wright.
The programme as rendered is as follows: Arrival of the regiment; words of welcome by General Barnes; chorus,
"Dixie's Land," led by the Tennessee Regiment band and the chorus, the audience and the boys of the regiment join
ing fn the chorus;' battalion drill; guard mount; solo and chorus, "Battle Hymn of the Republic," the solo by C. H. Van
Orden; company drill, close order; war song, an original hymn by Charles S. Greene, written for the occasion and dedi
cated to the Tennessee Regiment; company drill, extended order; chorus, ''Hail, Columbia"; review of the regiment by
General Charles King and staff; solo, "The Star-spangled Banner," Miss Grace Davis; chorus, "The Soldier's Farewell";
battalion parade; regimental marching salute.

joyable that preparations have been made
to- attend seventy-live strong next Sun

church tastefully decorated and a male
quartet of soldiers will sing. They are:
W. W. Craycroft, H. Sherwood and the
Richard brothers.
A rumor was current In camp to-day
that the Eighth Regiment was to be or- j
dered East soon. The officers and men
were very anxious to go to Honolulu, but
falling in this would like to be sent East.
None of the officers would say to-night
that any intimation of their destination
had been received.

A Rumor That Seems to Have
Some Foundation, as It Is
Partly Confirmed.
The rumor that was quietly floated
around in military circles last evening
that there is a possibility of Major Gener
al Otis not palling to-day, and probably
not at all, at least not for Manila, was
confirmed to a considerable extent by a
well-Informed officer of high rank. It Is
known that General Otis is waiting for
important documents relative to affairs
In Hawaii which are coming by mail, and
it is also known that he is hourly ex
pecting a telegram from Washington
which will decide whether he sails or re
mains here.
It is said that the "War Department has
had under consideration for several days
the advisability of sending no more
troops to the Philippines unless a requi
sition comes from General Merritt, who
should reach Manila within ten or twelve
days. The moment he arrives there he
will put himself in cable communication
with Washington. It would not be at all
surprising, therefore, If General Otis were
held here until after the arrival of Gen
eral Merritt at Manila. All this explains
the significant remail: of General Otis
on Thursday evening that he "was still
in the dark" and was waiting to hear
from Washington. At midnight a de
cision had not been reached by the War
Department.
It may be that General Otis will be di
rected to sail to Honolulu, at any rate,
and there await instructions after Gener
al Merritt has been heard from.
THE SIXTH CALIFORNIA.
Major General Merriam Visits
the Troops Stationed at
Fort Point.
Major General Merriam, commanding
the Department of California, visited the
fortifications at' Fort Point yesterday and j
I inspected the works. , The general ob
l served Major Grant's troops of the Sixth
j California Infantry Regiment of Volun
j teers, and spoke highly of their advance
: ment. These California volunteers have |
had daily instruction In the work of
! handling tho high-power guns at this im
â  portant station, and their efficiency has
commanded the earnest attention of regu
lar officers.
General Merriam will probably go
' aboard the Government steamer General
! McDowell to-day, and join in giving Ma
i jor General Otis and the regulars a
: proper "send-off."

; General H. G. Otis Banqueted.
The farewell banquet tendered to Briga- j
dier General H. G. Otis at the Palace Ho
' tel last evening by P. G. Gibbon of Los
' Angeles was a fitting parting testimonial
I of the hospitality and loyalty of which
! the citizenship of California is noted.
1 Around the festal board were many of
"the prominent commanders now stationed I
at the various camps, both in this city j
and in Oakland, who drank the health of 1
their superior and their host in a spirit |
of true fellowship. Many â¢ toasts on the 1
subject of the war were made, and fears ]
for the future drowned in the flowing i
bowl, which circulated freely among â¢ the !
guests: At the conclusion of the banquet ]
three cheers were given for the success
of the mission upon which the general !
will start this morning, and as many i
more for the safe return of both him and
his men. â¢ i^y^-i^-s/S^ J-^..f.fj

GALLAGHER'S BAD BREAK.
An Attorney Gets His Clients Into
the Meshes of the Law.
Attorney Walter Gallagher made a bad
break In Judge Conlan's court yesterday.
He represented Frank Donnelly, Joseph
Hodge and John Bonner, three of the six
men who were arrested recently by Lieu
tenant Anderson and Policeman Clancy
for stealing brass Journals from the Pa
cific Rollins Mills. The Judge held the
three defendants to answer before the Su
perior Court in $500 bonds each.
"Your Honor has made a mistake." said
Gallagher. "The three defendants are in
nocent, but the three men your Honor dis
charged the other day are the guilty
ones. The three referred to by Gallagher
were John Sullivan, James Murray and
Frank Burke.
"The three men were dismissed, as you
know," retorted the Judge, "owing to "the
insufficiency of the evidence, but as you
Reem to know that they were guilty I will !
make use of my rights and issue bench
warrants for their arrest so you may have ;
an opportunity of testifying what you I
know about the case. 1 am glad you, as
an officer of the court, have drawn my at
tention to the matter."
The action of the Judge was a surprise
to Gallagher, but he could only grin and
bear it.
Tibbetts Pleaded Guilty.
J. E. Tibbetts, arrested some time ago
on a charge of misdemeanor embezzle
ment, pleaded guilty to the charge before
Judge Wallace yesterday. Tibbetts ap
propriated a gold watch and a diamond
ring belonging to Mrs. Georgia E. Hub
bard. He will be sentenced to-day.

In Loveland, Colorado, there is a man named Park, who is en-
gaged in merchandising, and he calls his place the " Golden Rule
Store." When opportunity offers, this gentleman never fails to recom-
mend Ripans Tabules and to give his own experience with them, which
he relates as follows : " For fully twenty-five years I have been an
astnmatic. As a general thing throughout the winter, I have to re-
main indoors at least three or four days in each month. I have suf-
fered a great deal â yet all the precautions I might take did not keep
me free from these terrible attacks. About eighteen months ago I
commenced taking RIPANS TABULES to regulate my stomach. 1
am of a bilious temperament, and as soon as I become bilious I am
sure to have attacks of asthma. The Tabules keeps my stomach all
right, and for the past year I have not been confined f> the house at
all. My asthma is not cured â but the attacks are very slight. Ijiso
on an average two Tabules every Sunday, one on Wednesday *aa one
â¢o Friday,"

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 14.â The stock market
showed a firm resistance to pressure all day,
and when the news was received that Santiago
had surrendered on our terms a vigorous up
ward movement set in, which wiped out a large
part of the losses Incurred in yesterday's bear
raid. The fear of the introduction of yellow
fever Into this country if it should gain a foot
hold among our forces had as much to do with
yesterday's decline as did the fears of a mili
tary setback. This was indicated by the
sharp recovery to-day in such stocks as Louis
ville and Nashville and Southern Railway pre
ferred. There was a brief period of depression
at the opening, due to some sympathy with
London, where the belief prevailed that the
Spaniards would refuse to surrender Santiago
and thus necessitate a long siege. The local
bears early evinced uneasiness and bought
etocks to cover short contracts put out with
great confidence yesterday. Thin confidence had
been unsealed, not only by the strong belief
expressed In â  racial circles in Washington that
Santiago would surrender, but also by a real
ization that the favorable effect of the success
of the Government loan would nave to be met.
The covering movement was aided by a raid
upon the anthracite group, which yielded easily
and dragged the market back to near last
night's level, about which it drifted very slug
gishly until the final upward movement.
Net gains In most stocks were near a point,
and [l cases, notably Omaha and Hawaiian
Commercial, gains exceeded 2 points. The en
tire absorption of the Government loan by
rniall subscriptions seems â¢ practically assured.
There Is no doubt that this will release con
siderable sums of money held by banks, cor
porations and syndicates as reserves against
bids for large amounts of the bonds. As an
object lfsson on the wealth and resources of
the country this subscription of a $200,000,1*10
loan bearing interest below the ruling savings
bank rate is expected to have a striking effect.
The movement In speculative bonds continued
large to-day and the upward course of prices
was resumed, traders covering short contracts
put out yesterday. Total sales. J3.920.000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 14.â The' Cincinnati Price
Current came to the rescue of the downward
' tending Wheat at the start by remarking that
the disappointment as to yields continued and |
j that former estimates were being steadily re
duced. This, together with private advices
from gome sections of poor threshing returns.
Infused a little courage Into believers in a
small crop. Shorts were also Impressed to the
extent of covering some of the Wheat sold dur-
I ing the weak spell yesterday afternoon. The
London market was likewise firm and 6@6Ud
; higher for "off coast" and "on passage," and
I as a consequence the price of September here
! advanced %c over last night's close. An at
tempt, however, to secure some profit on the
i long side caused a %c break, and that was in
turn reversed when a prominent bear put
1 brokers in to buy on the last named decline.
The amount of business done In the pit was the
smallest In twelve months, some traders doing i
nothing at all. This, it was claimed, was due j
chiefly to the corroding Influence of the war j
tax. Chicago receipts were 44 cars, of which :
3S were new. September advanced %(<JUc on
the day. The report of the Price Current that
the Corn crop condition was moderately less
assuring, much of it approaching a critical
condition, together with talk of hot winds, |
strengthened Corn. Light receipts were also j
a factor. September closed HS^c higher.
Oats sympathized with the other grains. â 
There was a better shipping demand. Septem- :
ber cloned %c higher.
A good demand for cash products was pro- I
, ductive of a better feeling in Provisions. Pork !
| and ribs gained 24c each and lard sc.

! trated by the fact that whereas the large con

! their winter stocks by this time, this year they
have' not bought a pound over their dally

The canners are hot after Bartiett Pears and
are telegraphing to the growers, asking them
to name prices, but the growers, realizing that
the crop of Pears and Peaches Is limited this
year, .are not responding as readily as the can
ners could wish. ..The: canners have been con
tracting at $25 per ton, delivered In San Fran
cisco, but the tendency -in the market Is to
ward still better prices.
Apricots in small boxes are weaker, but In
bulk â¢ to the canners are â¢as firm as ever.

SEDUCTIVE POWER OF OPIUM.
"The seductive power of opium la
well told by De Qulncy, but no man
who has not been a victim of the drug
can faintly comprehend its fearful fas
cination." said Mr. L. W. Malone of
New York, at Chamberlin's.
"Once I was hurt by a boiler explo
sion so seriously that the doctors
thought it impossible for me to recover.
To let me die easy they gave me opium
to allay the intense agony I suffered
every moment. Under its spell I was
in paradise â could see the most beau
tiful objects, talk with the lovliest peo
ple, ride the most magnificent steeds,
and, in fact, was in a state of such glo
rious enchantment that I seemed to en
joy the very quintessence of bliss.
"But by and by contrary to the prog
nosis of my doctors I began to mend,
and at last, when they saw I was des
tined to live, they began to gradually
shut me off from my beloved opium.
Then it was I began to suffer the tor
ments of the damned. I would beg for
it, cry for it, entreat, curse and
threaten, but the order was inflexible â
no more could I have. Gladly would
I have undergone the accident again
just for one dose of the magic medicine.
More than once I would plan â in sleep
of course â the murder of my attendant
for refusing me just a mite of what I
prayed for. In the whole category of
human woe there is no condition worse
than this." â Washington Post.
TEXTILE EDUCATION IN GEORGIA
At the last session of the Georgia
Legislature the sum of $10,000 was ap
propriated to the Georgia School of
Technology for the purpose of adding
a textile department to that institu
tion; but In order to make this sum
available it was provided that another
like sum should first be raised by pop
ular subscription, making the total en
dowment $20,000.
Since the action of the Legislature in
passing the measure above Indicated,
the trustees and friends of the Georgia
School of Technology have been tire
less in the efforts which they have put
forth to raise the requisite preliminary
sum. What measure of success they
have realized in this undertaking, des
pite the adverse circumstances which
operated against them, was announced
by President Lyman Hall when he
stated that the full sum of $10,000 had
been raised by popular subscription.
This means that the contingent sum
of $10,000 appropriated by the Legisla
ture last fall will be immediately forth
coming, and that nothing will now
prevent the speedy equipment of the
proposed textile department.

000 muscles in his trunk alone, while a
man has only 577 In his entire body.

MR. DALTON'S
AMBITIONS
Anxious for a Seat on
the State Board.
AFTER MOREHOUSE'S PLACE
RECENT ASSESSMENT BOLL AS
A CAMPAIGN DOCUMENT.
Storehouse May Have to Restore Ten
Millions That Has Been Diplo
matically Taken Off for
the First Time.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 14.
It Is now generally believed that County
Assessor Palter., who says he Is yet un
decided as to his political future, is anx
ious to succeed Mr. Morehouse in the j
State Board of Equalisation. Mr. Dalton {
has repeatedly stated that he floes not
know whether he will run again for
County Assessor Independently or
whether he will seek the Republican nom
ination. Everything now points to the
possibility that Mr. Dalton aspires higher
than any county office.
Six months ago a Democratic paper an
nounced Mr. Dalton editorially as a very
strong candidate for a member v/f the
State Board of Equalization, and local
politics, In ho far as Mr. Dal to Is con
cerned, for the past few months, have all
tended to strengthen this belief. The as
sessment roll recently completed for this
county is said to be one of the nÂ«o-5t pio
nounced campaign documents ever com
piled by a candidate. It reduces the en
tire assessment of the county nearly 12 per
cent. This, of course, represents the
amount deducted from the holdings of
small property-owners. On th> other
hand, large properties have bdon in
creased, and the water front property,
which was taken from the rolls three years
ago. has now been returned to them, fcr
the same reason that It was stricken off
The â¢ Supreme Court decisions covering
the water-front cases have not yet been i
interpreted by the local courts In accord
ance with the order of the Supreme j
Court, but It Is a good thing politically
to have It on the rolls at this time, and it
Is there.
The present member of the State Board
of Equalization from this county is L.
C. Morehouse. Mr. M .rehouse lives in
San Leandro and he and Mr. Dalton have
frequently clashed during the past four
years over local assessments. Mr. More
house Is a Republican and naturally his
vote in the State Board will decide the
fate of Alameda County's State assess- '
ment.
Should ho decide Alnmeda County is
no less valuable this year than during the
other three years of Mr. Dalton's adr
ministration ho may be forced to add the
ten millions to the roll for State equaliza
tion purposes. This would naturally be
taken advantage of by the friends of.
Palton to make Mr. Mori :.popu
lar, and the whole business is regarded
as a shrewd political move.
Mr. Storehouse's supporters are already
declaring that Mr. Dalton's reduction Is
to a great extent unwarranted. They as
sert that there are more improvements,
more street railroads, more docks, more
large buildings and in every way more
signs of progress than there were at any
time during- the punt f<>ur years. They j
declare th.tr were Mr. Dalton a Republl- j
can he would not attempt to discredit i
th* fact that times are better now than
'inder a national Democratic administra
tion.
The contest is very nicely balanced. On
one side is Mr. Dalton. Independent poli
tics, and the prospect of a reduction of
taxation; on the oth^r hand Is Mr. More
house, Republicanism, and the possibility
that he may decide that Alameda has
not become 12 per cent poorer under Me-
Kinley's administration.
BACKWARD OVER A BANK.
Two Women, a Horse and Buggy
Take a Twenty-Five-Foot
Tumble.
, OAKLAND, July 14.â Mrs. C. G. Yale
V and Miss Ethel Jerome had a serious ac
cident last Sunday that might have been
the death of them both. The details have
Just been made public. The ladles went
to San Mateo Saturday night to spend
Sunday with Mr. Yale, and Mr. and Mrs.
E. B. Jerome and Miss Nettle Yale were
in the party. On Sunday a drive was in
augurated, with Mr. Yale and Mr. Jerome
accompanying the ladles on wheels.
Something seemed to worry the horse
that the ladies were driving, and Mrs,
Jerome alighted to investigate. The
horse began to back, and Miss Nettle
Jumped out. In another instant the surrey
went over an embankment, turning som
ersaults, with Mrs. Yale and Miss Ethel
Jerome on the inside. For twenty-five
feet the outfit tumbled, and lodged in
some bushes at the bottom of the ravine
Mrs. Yale expressed the sentiment of both
the other ladies when she stated that she
was sure death had overtaken her in a
most horrible form. Neither of them ut
tered a scream or even a word.
The gentlemen scorched up to where the
accident happened, and disentangled th*>
ladles. Neither was seriously injured, and
the surrey was In a fit condition to carry
the ladles back to San Mateo. The horse
escaped injury. The women have suffered
from the nervous strain, but are able to
receive their friends' congratulations
upon their escape.
Luigi Dulcich Weds Again.
OAKLAND, July 14.â Luigi Dulcich, n

William Hart Passes Away.
BERKELEY, July 14.â William Hart

nue. He was 52 years of age and a car
penter by trade. It was while; working
upon a building In Temescal, some weÂ»its

or over fifty feet, caused by a defective
ecaffoMlng. The injuries have proved fa
tal. The funeral will be held next Satur
day afternoon.

ALMOST IN THE HAVEN.
Captain Johnson, a Pioneer Shipping Mil
lionaire, Is Beyond Hope.
OAKLAND. July 14.â Captain James Johnson, a wealthy pioneer shipping man
and Benior partner of one of the oldest firms on the. coast, is seriously ill at his
beautiful home on Claremont avenue and no hope is entertained of his recovery.
For forty-six years Captain Johnson has been engaged in the coast shipping
business in this State. Before coming 1 to the United States he was quartermaster
of vessels running between his native, country, Denmark, and Central America.
In 1552 James Johnson came to California and engaged in the Sacramento River
trade with schooners. He carried muwh of the material up the river for the rail
road company.
In IS7O he Joined his business interests with those of Mr. Emigh, who has ever
since been his partner. They entered upon an extensive warehouse, lumber and
shipping trade and owned four river schooners. Ten years ago the firm sold their
warehouses at Rit> Vista and confined their ventures to shipping, commission and
insurance in San Francisco. The firm now owns two coast vessels and has an
interest in seventeen others. The coasters are named. "Seven Sisters" and "Five
Brothers," which is the number of sons and daughters that have been born to
Captain and Mrs. Johnson. Eleven weeks ago Captain Johnson was taken sick
and he has steadily grown worse. His eleven surviving children are ail at home.
The physicians hold out no encouragement.
TRUSTEES TAKE
IT ALL BACK
The Water Ordinance
Yet Hangs Fire.
ALAMEDA COMPANY SCORED
CHARGED WITH DISREGARDING
THE PUBLIC NEED.
The Board bays It Is Powerless, but
Will Push the Movement
for a Municipal
System.
BEKKELEi, July 14.â 1t is no longer
a misdemeanor, punishable by fine, for a
resident of Berkeley to water his lawn.
The Town Trustees have refused to act
In the matter, for when the ordinance to
that effect came up for final passage at
a special meeting held this evening, not
one voted In Its favor. The clrcumctances
of the rase have changed Blnce last Mon
day, hence the reversal of the board's
previous deciaion. The Alameda Water
Company may still try t" enforce Us pol
icy of restricting Irrigation, but it will
pr^t no support from the Trustees In Its
â¢â (Torts to do so. Meanwhile household
ers who comply with the company's order
will see their gardens waste under their
f-yes; those who do not comply will have
to reckon with the company Itself.
In the meantime every effort is being
made to push the plans for a municipal
witter system, and from all prospects, If
the plan be feasible at all, It will be put
through before the present Trustees are
out of office.
The present attitude of the board
toward the water company Is due to the
investigations of Its committee. The
Alameda company advanced the plea
some time ago that It would be impossi
ble to connect its mains with those of
an Oakland company. The report of. the
committee shows the case to be quite dif
ferent. They find that another Oakland
company would be glad to sell its com
modity to the Berkeley corporation, pro
vided the latter were willing. It Is only
too evident, however, that the latter is'
not willing and the Trustees say they will
not order a restriction of irrigation when
there is an ample supply at the com
pany's very doors which they refuse to
take advantage of from mere whim and
caprice.
So, when President Richards called
the board to order this evening and asked
for the final passage of the ordinance
sent to print last Monday Trustees
Frame, Hoff and Maloney announced that
they had decided to change their votes
of the previous evening. President Rich
ards then put the final question and it
was received with a unanimous negative.
Trustee Bennett expressed the sentiment
of the board when he said: "It is clear
that our town is in a queer predicament.
Here we are threatened with a water fam
ine on the one hand, bringing with It
great loss of property and possibly death
by disease; on the other, we encounter a
corporation, abundantly able to supply
that necessary commodity, yet refusing to
do so, and over whom we are absolutely
powerless." He thought that the only
policy was to submit for the time being,
using the moral prestige of the board to
persuade householders to husband the
limited supply as much as possible. The
board decided to adopt his suggestion and
thus to drop the matter.
The subject of a municipal supply sys
tem was then Introduced and the commit
tee empowered to expend $2500 in conduct
ing proper Investigations as to the feasi
bility of the plan, and to employ compe
tent engineers and experts when neces
sary. * ______________

of the Board of City Trustees was held
last evening to discuss the matter of hav

adopted setting forth the necessity for
maintaining communication between the

ing the city of Alameda to do i^s share to
ward payng the expense, and asking the
Supervisors to take immediate steps In the
matter. A committee cejnsisting of Trus

ASSESSMENT FARCE IS

ASKED FOR REDTJCTJIONS.
Unless the Law Has Seen Changed
the Political By-Play Will Be
the Same as Last
Year.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 14.
All day long the Supervisors, sitting as
a Board of Equalization, possessed their
souls In patience because they had no al
ternative. 'With remarkable devotion to
duty they were all on hand at 10 o'clock
this morning, waiting to receive some of
the many expected protests from the
railroad company, water front company,
street railroads, water companies and oth
er large property-owners. But they came
not, and It Is rumored that many of them
do not intend to give any one a chance this
year to do politics at their expense.
As to the railroad company'B fights,
which have been a source of excitement
annually for the past three years, they
have been already settled. Each year
District Attorney Snook has advised the
Supervisors that the property in dispute is
assessed by the State Board and there
fore cannot be assessed a second time by
the County Board. Nevertheless it is put
on the rolls each year and as regularly
taken off.
There is no doubt that there will be
some application from the railroad com
pany to have property removed from the
roll, because should the assessments not
be contested before the County Board, the
State Board haa no jurisdiction over
them. Among these properties will be the
Seventh street franchise, the franchise
on the mole, and the local Berke
ley franchise. The railroad company
has pleaded each year that this
property is part of their main line sys
tem, and consequently, hot liable to local
taxation. District Attorney Snook has
advised the Supervisors that such is the
case and that they have therefore no op
tion In the matter. The State Board of
Equalization has held the same view and
will, doubtless, be appealed to again this
year. There are yet ten more days in
which the County Board can pass on ap
plications regarding assessments.

HURT PROUD
OF HIS RECORD
Gives His Opinion of a
Wyoming Shooter.
SCHAEFFER IS ON TRIAL
DRAWS OUT THE HATRED OF
THE CATTLE BARON.
Says His Wife's Present Husband
Is Not Worth Any One's
Risking a Trip to the
Gallows.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 14.
The man who is now married to the
mother of Cattle Baron J. J. Hurt's chil
dren waa In the Police Court this morning
for his preliminary examination on the
charge of assault to murder.
As Mr. Hurt wanted to leave this even
ing for his home in Wyoming his testi
mony was taken although the defendant's
counsel asked for a continuance. Hurt re
peated the etory already published of the
alleged attempt of Alphonso Schaeffer to
shoot him near the Sheriff's office on July
6. He said he was coming out of the door
and on looking around he saw Deputy
Sheriff White struggling with Schaeffer,
who had a pistol in his hand pointed to
ward the witness. He also heard Schaef
ftr say, "I want him."
Ujion cross-examination by Attorney
Woolner, Hurt Indignantly stated that he
had nothing against Schaeffer and that h%.
knows nothing about mm except a.s a tin
horn gambler, a thief, an ex-convict and
a general all-around tough customer.
"Didn't you threaten to kill Schaefter in
Wyoming*" asked Woolner.
"In our country we wouldn't kill a man
like him," Bald Hurt. "We wouldn't want
to hany for killing a thing like him."
Judge Allen told the witness that he
could answer questions, but that nobody
cared to hear his personal opinions, upon
which Hurt stated that the attorney
should show more courtesy if he did not
like his answers.
Hurt was then asked if he had, not
threatened to kill Schaeffer in the pres
ence of various parties, especially in the
presence of his daughter Josie.
"I did not," replied Hurt. "I did say
once that if this man Schaeffer ever
abused my daughter I would shoot him
through and through."
The witness' attention was then directed
to an incident in Wyomirrg when Schaeffer
started to lay a sidewalk in compliance
with orders of the City Board of Caspar.
Hurt remembered the incident, but denied
threatening to kill Schaeffer when tho lat
ter started in to put down the sidewalk.
He said he did not remember that Schaef
fer had anything to do with the sidewalk,
and denied threatening to kill him at that
time. When asked If he had not killed a
man In Wyoming Hurt replied that he had
and that he would do so again under the
samp circumstances. He said that he was
Justified in doing bo; that he had shot the
man three times and would have contin
ued shooting at him if he had not run
away.
This concluded the examination of the
witness, and at the rerpiest of defendant's
counsel the case was continued to next
Tuesday afternoon, at which time It Is
hoped Judf.' E. M. Gibson will be well
enough to appear.

HULDA REBER DIES
FROM DIPHTHERIA
MOTHER ARRIVED ONLY TO
FIND HER CHILD DEAD.
The Little Victim Was Attending
a Special Demonstration of
Salvationists for Chil
dren.
-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 14.
Hulda E. Reber, a little child B years
old, died yesterday at the Salvation Army
camp at Trestle Glen of malignant diph
theria after a couple of hours' sickness.
The little girl was one of a number of
children who were brought over from
San Francisco to pal-take in the chil
dren's demonstration of the Salvation
Army. The children's home, whence
they came, is located on Russian Hill
across the bay. Soon after their arrival
in camp Hulda showed signs of convul
sions, and although a doctor was imme
diately procured, nothing could be done
to relieve the little sufferer, and she died
two hours later.
The child was being kept at the home
and supported by her mother, who is a
widow, and works out. As soon as the
child was seen to be seriously 111 an ef
fort was made to bring Mrs. Reber across
to Oakland, but she could not be found
In time, and long before she arrived her
little daughter had passed away. The
suddenness of the death created a little
sensation in the camp and some of the
campers at once moved their tents to a
new part of the glen. All tha clothing
of the infant was speedily burned to
avoid contagion and the remains were at
once removed.

MRS. FLOOD
SEEKS A
DIVORCE
Woes of a Prominent
Physician's Wife.
CRUEL TREATMENT ALLEGED
THE DEFENDANT USED HIS
FISTS FREELY.
Complainant States That on More
Than One Occasion Her Hus
band Beat and Severely
Bruised Her.
Dr. Philip H. Flood, a well-known
physician of this city, has been sued by
his wife, Ida L. Flood, for a divorce.. The
complaint was filed yesterday, and ex
treme cruelty on the part of the husband
toward his wife is named as the ground
upon which 'the action is based. The
marriage of the litigants took place in
Alabama in December of 1871. A short
time later they moved to this city, where
they have since resided.
Mrs. Flood in the complaint tells the
story of a most unhappy life as the wife
of Dr. Flood during the past six years.
Sho alleges that during her married life
her husband has frequently treated her
in a cruel, harsh and tyrannical manner,
and Is guilty of such conduct toward her
as rendered it unsafe and dangerous for
her to longer make her residence with
him, and, in consequence, on September
30 1597, she left him.
Many sjioiirtc charges of cruelty are
made by Mrs. Flood. On the 4th of July,
1597, she avera that her husband, after
upplying many opprobrious epithets to
her, struck her with his fist, blacking
her eye. Three days later, after again
abusing her, he used his nails, and se
verely scratched her face. He then
ceased his cruel treatment for a few days,
but on July 11, when Mrs. Flood was on
her way to a theater with a young lady
friend, Flood met her on the street, and,
after the usual volley of epithets, pro
ceeded to beat her, the result being that
she was severely bruised. Later her hus
band treated her in such a manner that
she became frightened and deserted him.
She says that since that time she has not
da rod to return to his home, and that by
reason of his brutal treatment her health
has been undermined and that she is now,
in consequence, suffering from nervous
prostration.
Flood is very woll-to-do, and in the
complaint his wife asks, in addition to the
decree of divorce, that he be made to pay
her alimony in a sum sufficient to support
her according to her station in life. Flood
owns property at 4: J Â»1 Larkin street, S4l
Ellis and 627 Ellis, valued in total at about
jr.O.OOO: and in addition has ether assets.
The court is requested to restrain the de
fendant from disposing of or incumbering
the property during the pendency of the
action, that Mrs. Flood may not be left
In want when the suit has been finally
adjudicated.
LESLIE BLACKBURN ARRESTED.
Drew His Revolver on Billy O'Brien
and Challenged Him to Lay On.
OAKLAND, July 14.â Leslie Blackburn,
the well-known politician and sergeant
at-arms of the Senate, was arrested to
night for drawing his revolver in the Of
fice saloon while quarreling with "Billy"
O'Brien, another politician. For some
time there has been ill-feeling between
the men, and to-night some parties
brought them together that they might
learn the truth from each other's lips.
Blackburn drew his pistol and told
O'Brien to arm himself, O'Brien said he
was not armed, and bystanders stopped
the. quarrel, after which Blackburn was
taken to the City Prison and chaTged
with disturbing the peace. Blackburn and
O'Brien had a quarrel and fight in the
6ame saloon some months ago.

MAMIE GRIFFIN'S GREAT HEAT
GREATEST FxELD OF TROTTERS
EVER RACED WEST.
Resort and Much Better Have Ea
Wins â Silver Queen Beats 2:20.
Notes and Gossip of the
Track.
Toggles smashed the Oakland record for
trotters in the free for all yesterday, but
he had to do some lively work at the end
to beat out Colonel Henshaw's magnifi
cent mare Mamie driffin.
The timeâ 2:lo^4â lowers Toggles* old \
record considerably, and timed alone he !
made the circuit in li:(W\, a* he was back j
at the word "Go." Mamie led away, i
Zombro, the favorite, breaking at the
turn, and the quarter was :32 1 , 2 . "She
will never live that clip," remarked a by- j
stander as Ed Dennis chalked up the !
quarter. But at the half it was 1:04%â
faster than any of the pacers to date â
yet she led. Zombro went fast to the
head of the stretch, when Billy Donathan
pulled out of the rail position and tried
for the heat from the outside. Toggles
clung to Mamie Griflln to the short Hag,
and It looked cither's heat, but nearing
the wire the gelding forged ahead, and in
a last effort to win out Sullivan drove the
black mare to a break. Toggles is a won
der, and no mistake, for he trotted the
last half In 1:0*%, and had a real trotter
to beat before he got the money, as
Mamie is good and game always.
The first enthusiasm of the meeting was
manifest when they returned to weigh
out. Zombro was favorite at 4to .">;
Toggles quoted at .'? to 2. Mamie Criflin
at :';. Ethel Downs at .', and (.'lay s at a
like figure. The auctions sold Held 7,
Zambro 5. It was the best lot of trotters
ever lined up for the word in the West.
Only one before approached, and that was
ut Chicago In 1*93. in the Columbian $15,000
free for all. Saturday the same trotters
m*Â»et In a two in three, and Monterey
(2:1314) will doubtless start with them.
The State trotting race record is Ottinger's
2:09%, and it shows how they are trotting
the Oakland track this meeting. Not a
breath of wind was astir, and Hilly
Fieldwlck worked the track to concert
pitch. The betting was heavy.
Aside from Toggles' gnat victory, Presi
dent Knight's pretty mare Silver Queen
covered herself with glory by defeating
Iran Alto in 2:10^ 1" a rattle on the
stretch. Nellie Bly was favorite at 4 to 5,
JUMPED FROM A THIRD STORY WINDOW.
In a Delirum Caused bu Descondencu He Committed
Suicide.
HAHRY H. HASKELL, In ft fit of do- '
lirium, leaped from the third-story
window of his home, on the south
west corner of California and Web
ster streets, shortly before midnight on
"Wednesday, sustaining injuries which
resulted in his death. The cause of
the act is attributed to despondency.
brought on by sickness and the lack of
employment, which weighed upon his
mind ever since his discharge from the j
California Woolen Mills, just prior to
their close some months ago. His pa
rents say that ever since that time he
has never been the same mentally, and
the state of delirium in which he was
during the past four days previous to the
accident was caused by this execessive
despondency and a natural illness. For
the past week It was found necessary to
administer opiates to relieve his pain, and
it is probably duo to the continual ad
ministration of this drug that caused the
demented condition of the patient, which
prompted the determination Wednesday
evening of relieving himself of pain and
anxiety by taking the fatal leap from his
bedroom window.
In the sane moments that would com"
at intervals to the afflicted man during
the delirium he begged that an attendant
would remain constantly with him, as he
feared in a moment of insanity be would
be tempted to take his own life. The re
quest was granted and a nurse sent for,
who, together with the young man's
father, kept constant watch at his bed
side.
Through negligenece or fatigue, the
nur.se. immediately before the accident
occurred, had allowed herself to recline
on a lounge In the farther end of the
I but landed fourthâ next to the last. Sliver ;
i Queen Is one of the busiest trotters one
ever paw, and will yet reach 2:15. She :
! trots without checking and can step it off ;
: a 2:10 gait when steady. Brooks kept Iran .
Alto on tiptoes all the last end of the heat |
and drove him a splendid heat.
Resort won easily in 2:17%, Lady Mar >
garet, the midget pacer in Durfee's stable, i
securing place honors over Don in a drive. ;
' It was just a workout for Resort and the
pace early in the mile being moderate the
big fellow had plenty left on which to fin
ish. He was 2 to 5 in the books and sold j
in the auctions at 10 to 5 for the lot.
Much Better won. her race comfortably :
in 2:15*4 each heat. Abdine got the place !
the first heat and in a lively homestretch
sprint in the second Fitz Aymon landed in â¢
second place and thus got third money.
Charles David had speed but was un
steady. Much Better was 1 to 2 and 1 to 3 ;
and few played it save for place and shov.
money. Bunch never spoke to her and she I
showed capacity to border on 2:12 condi- :
tions being favorable.
The last event went to the black mare
Lindo in 2:19%. and the followers of the er
i ratic little mare Polo lost a lot of money.
Polo made a standstill break nt the far
turn and hasn't cauhgt as yet. Thomas H. 1
by Dexter Prince, paced a great last half
j and secured the place. Captain Hackett j
; was once more an incendiary and a lot of
! good coin was burned up on the big son of
j Steinway. Sullivan nor any one else can
i win with him the way he acts at present.
On the train and boat the Toggles mile
j was the sole topic of discussion and it was ]
j predicted that Saturday's winner must i
I lower the State record, so it must be a
| race worth going miles to see. Sullivan
I thinks Mamie Griffin will be better after

, bro a quarter at a 2:02 clip and the way he

| trotters ever rung out in California and j
I the winner will be decided by Inches a f

without breaks.

occasion for her to remain up longer, as j
Haskell'a father could undoubtedly at

Haskell Jumped from the bed, and open
ing the window sprang upon the balcony
Immediately below, from where be leaped
to the sidewalk, a distance of over fifty
feet, carrying a r^rt "f the railing of the
balcony with him. The nurse, who had
been aroused by the cries of the young
man's father. 'made a feeble attempt to
save Haskell from carrying out his deter
mination of suicide, but before she gained
the window her patient was lying, appa
! rently a corpse, on the street bfelow.
They rushed downstairs and found that
the man was still living, but unconscious.
He was lifted up and taken into the
bouse and Dr. Stansfield of the Lane Hos

After a careful examination the physi
cian found that the skull of the injured
man had been fractured on the stone
sidewalk, and that he was probably se
verely Injured internally. Concussion of
the brain immediately Bel in as a result
of the fall, and after lingering in an un

cumbed to the effects of the fall.
Haskell was 34 yean of age and leaves

HE ACCUSES
THE FATHER
Domestic Troubles of W.
T. Plunkett Aired.
UNSOLICITED INTERFERENCE
ANSWER OF THE HUSBAND TO
HIS WIFE'S CHARGES.
He Says That All His Domestic
Unhappiness Has Been
Caused by Norman
Parrlsh.
The answer to the divorce complaint
filed by Mrs. Cora Plunkett promises to
be as Interesting and salacious as the
complaint itself. The young and stalwart
nthlrte has many denials to make and
some new matter which he is determined
to Introduce as a cross-complaint.
William T. Phmkett, lawyer, school
teacher and football player, was not the
usually careless, smooth-sailing young
man yesterday, but one with a grievance
in his heart. He is i.etermined to oppose
the action of his wife and make her prove
the charges in the complaint. He alleges
that that document is false in every de
tail and colored beyond a shadow of the
truth.
The cause of all his marital Infelicities
he assign's to a modelling spirit on the
part of his wife's father. That he did not
live happily with his wife, he says, was
due to tho Interference of her parents,
who advised her in obstinacy and rebel
i lion. The San Jose episode, he aaerts, is
a tissue of lies, as set forth In the sensa
tional complaint. Plunkett said yester
i day: "I did not send my wife to San
j Jose to rid myself of her presence. She
i wished to go' there and I permitted it.
I Why I even escorted her to the train.
The" first blow she dealt me was then.
As she was about to board the train she
I told me sh<Â» did not intend to come back.
', I was astounded, and asked her for an ex
1 planation. I wrote to her, wanting to
i know when she Intended to return. I cm
i not think that her actions were prompted
I by her own will, but by her father's per
suasion. He was at the bottom of the
whole matter."
The incident of the woman in the room
receives a different interpretation as ex
plained by Plunkett. Continuing, he said:
"The woman who was in my room was
Mrs Alice M. Lewis, a cousin of mv wife*.
She was brought into my rooms for tho
first time by my wife herself. When my
! wife her sister, Mrs. Root, and her father
' burst into my rooms t v ;ey found me pack
; ing my trunks. Mrs. Lewis was assisting
me atthe time. She came there to inquire
about my domestic troubles and to see If
phe could not be of some assistance in rec
i onclllng me to my wife. When Mr. Parrish
broke Into the room he applied the vilest
' epithets to Mrs. Lewis and he was si-
I lenced with much difficulty."
The charge of brutality in the complaint
1 grieves Plunkett most poignantly. To him
it is an indication of the intense hatred
the father felt for him. He says he never
1 treated his wife but In the most affection
ate way until her own actions, induced by
hrr father's interference, drove him from
â  her
When Plunkett married Miss Parrish
he was a student at the Law School, and
â  her father, while not openly objecting to
; thf union, put every obstacle In the way
! to its consummation, he says.
Plunkett will file his answer to-morrow.

STUCK IN THE
MUD ALL NIGHT
Joe Warren's Experience
on the Water Front.
WILL NOT SOON FORGET IT
FELL THROUGH A HOLE IN
ONE OF THE WHARVES.
It Was Evening When the Accident
Happened and It Was Broad
Daylight Before He
Was Rescued.
Joe Warren, a machinist on the steamer
Centennial, had an experience last Wed
nesday night that he will not forget in
many a long day. His vessel is lying out
in the stream off Long Bridge and War
ren was due on board at S p. m. He went
to the Folsom-street landing early in the
evening in hoj^es of finding the ship's boat
there, but was disappointed. He waited
around until nearly S o'clock and then
started for the Mail dock thinking the
boat might have come in there. While
taking a short cut over the city's portion
of the water front he fell through one of
the numerous holfs in the wharf and
Xound himself up to his neck in mud and
water.
In his fall Warren struck a stringer and
hurt his left arm, side and leg. He yelled
for assistance but none came, and think
ing the tide was rising he scrambled to a
pile and there kf-pt his head above water.
At intervals he npeated his cries for help,
but no one lizard him, and at last he be
came so exhausted that he could not be
heard even if anybody ha/1 been around.
Aft'-r hanging to the pile for several
hours Warren found that the ti<V wns
going out and soon the mud in which he
was standing was clear. He was then
powerless to help himself and his arm and
lrg were paining him considerably. He
must then have fainted, because he re
members nothing mort; until he awoke to

find himself lying in the mud. the tide
coming in and it broad daylight. He then
began calling for help again, and finally
two boys heard him and went to his as
sistance. They got him on the wharf after
sOme trouble and then took him to the
Harbor Receiving Hospital, where Dr.
Stafford dressed his wounds, ant! made him
comfortable. Warren says that it will be
many a long day before he again attempts
to navigate the water front without a
guide. Â«
The Merchants' Exchange was gayly
dressed with bunting yesterday in honor
of General Bhafter'B victory in Cuba. On
the principal blackboard Captain Emery,
manager of the exchange, put up the an
nouncement of the fall of Santiago and
then th^ whole was draped with American
flags. The effect was very pretty and
Captain Emery received many compli
ments during the day.
The new schooner Dewey, the first of
her name, came in from Eureka yesterday
in tow of the tug Maggie. The Dewey
started from Xehalem Bay with 300.000
feet of lumber aboard and put into Eu
reka on the way down. The Dewey will
be used in the coast lumber trade.
The Frank A. Ra<-kliff*. another Klon
dike schooner, arrived from Philadelphia
yesterday. The gold-hunters who came
out on her are very anxious to reach Daw
son, so they will leave the vessel here and
nush on to St. Michael by steamer. The
Rackliff had a very uneventful passage
to San Francisco.
The river steamer Mary Ellen Galvin
was to sail to-day in tow of the Cleveland
tor St. Michael, but owing to some neces
sary repairs and alterations it will be sev

vin will not take any passengers and those
v/ho had bought tickets by her have had
their money refunded.
ROLLET WAS IN A
DESTRUCTIVE MOOD
CHOPPED UP THE FURNITURE
AND ABUSED HIS WIFE.
Divorce Granted the Unhappy Couple.
Marital Woes of the Hansens.
A Decree Granted Mrs.
Husbands.
Nellie Rollet was granted a divorce from
Thomas Wilfred Rollet by Judge Hunt
yesterday on the ground of extreme cru
elty. The allegation of Mrs. Rollet that
her husband was a man of ungovernable
temper and treated her in an inhumane
manner was well-founded, and many of
the specific charges made by the plaintiff
were corroborated by competent evidence i
during the trial of the case. Mrs Rollet I
alleged that on St. Patrick's day of last
year her husband, who is a teamster in
the employ of the Pacific Gas Improve
ment Company, became angry at her and
struck her a severe blow in the mouth
loosening her teeth and lacerating her lips'
On a subsequent date he used a clothes
wringer as a weapon in an endeavor to
seriously injure her. Not content with
this, he turned his attention to the furni
ture, and when all of it had been badly
damaged. If not completely demolished he
turned his attention to a piano and with
an ax destroyed its value as a decorative
piece of furniture. Evidence regarding all
the allegations was hoard, and a divorce
was promptly granted the palintiff The
custody of a minor child was *iven to
Mrs. Rollet.
The action of aLrs C. Hansen for a di
vorce from his wife. Margre*he liinsen
was also heard by Judge Hunt, but in that
case a divorce was denied Hansen
charged his wife with Intemperance and
in return she filed a Cross-complaint ask
ing that a decree of divorce be granted
her on the ground of cruelty. The evi
dence introduced, however was insuffi
cient. In the mind of the court to warrant
interference, and the prayers of both liti
gants were denied. The' custody of five
children was granted Mrs. Haneen and
her husband was ordered to pay her $25 I
alimony each month.
Mildred Husbands was granted a divorce
from William Husbands on the ground
th . a i HH e latter fallcd to P^vide his wife
with the common necessaries of life.

GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FANS
AT LAST THE LEAGUE SEEMS
WELL ON ITS LEGS.
Line Hits of the Local and Interior
Diamonds, Noting the Changes
and Improvements Among
the Various Clubs.
BY JOE CORBETT.
The teams composing the Pacific Coast
League are playing much better ball
these days than one would imagine. Last
Sunday all over the circuit good baseball
i was the order of things, even in our own
city, where in the past so many miserable
exhibitions have been witnessed.
The leaders and those reputed to be
! good teams lived up to their reputation,
| yet for superb playing were outdone by
I the lesser lights, Stockton and San Fran
j Cisco. These two t^ams put up a gamo
in Stockton last Sunday the like of which
has not been seen in that town for many
a day. For thirteen innings they fought
and struggled for supremacy, only to be
; compelled to retire with honors even by
tho going down of the sun. The exclte
! ment attending this grand game was of
j such a nature as to completely unnervo
; some of the boys, who are not as yet re
: covered from its effects.
Every game played out of towh was ex
j cellent and a credit to the boys. The
games at Recreation Park, especially
i that of Sunday, were exhibitions worthy
j of two times the attendance.
The situation at the present moment is
encouraging. Indeed. The managers as
! well as players have realized the urgent
necessity of playing good ball, and in
view of this fact the games from now on
will no doubt be the best seen" here in
i some time.
| This conclusion I have reached by no
j ticing the improved condition of most of
j the teams, ar.d the snappy, gingery spirit
j displayed by the Fresnos and Athletics
while playing last week. This spirit ot
, playing hard and earnestly to win was as
; scarce as good games but a short time
! ago. Teams would go upon the field de
void of vivacity and the other qualifica
tions so necessary to a team's success.
They would play as though it made no
| difference to them whether school kept
i or not, and consequently the most miser
! able exhibitions of the game ensued. They
I would not practice because it was too
much like work, and, in short, both man
agers and players appeared to have be
come inflated with the idea that all that
was necessary to make the league a
howling Buccess was to get together a
' few teams, fit them out with uniforms
] and bats, and let it go at that.
I They unfortunately overlooked the prin
j cipal and most important part of all, that
iof "playing good ball." This oversight
would have amounted to but little, had
all the mornhig papers undertaken to
make their fight. When It became ob
vious that no such luck vu theirs and
that the papers intended writing them up
i in strict accordance with the rules gov
erning baseball, they should have met the
I situation just as it presented itself, by
playing: good ball, and receiving good no
tices in return. They were provokingly
slow in realizing t hi.-;, despite the fact
that they were spoken of as they played j
and acted. The change, however has i
really asserted itself. The panics of late i
have been 90 per cent better than they
wore three weeks ago. The people are j
gradually becoming interested, and tho j
way they cheered and applauded during '
Sunday's game, at Kecroation Park, only j
goes to demonstrate what the outcome i
will be, if the teams continue playing in '<
their present form. And I can see no rea- j
son why they should not if they continue
to practice, and exhibit the same lively
spirit so conspicuous of late.
I The Second Battallion of Washington
volunteer Infantry hap organized v ;
; ball team, and is quite anxious to try eon- i
i elusions with some of the teams now
! playing around and in San Francisco.
â¢ I have been endeavoring to arrange a j
I g.-ime for the pleasure of the soldiers, but '
those clubs with whom I have talked on
tho subject are overburdened with sohed- !
tiled games, and regret exceedingly their '
inability to compete. Any team wishing
to play them ran complete arrangements i
by addressing a letter to baseball depart
ment of The Call.
The Golden Gates, n-ho on last Sunday '
played }.he WatÂ»onviHes, claim that mVi
stead of being defeated they were robbed.
This team for an amateur organization Is
second to none in the State, and Its claim
is that it defeated the Watsonvilles in the
last inning, only to be robbed by the urn.
pire, who. after calling a hit fair, which
gave them three runs and the game,
| changed his decision and said the ball
I was foul. The Golden Gates refused to
continue the game after they had won it
fairly, and the umpire therefore complet
ed his unfair work by giving the game to
the Watsonvilles. Queer methods those.
The Golden Gates have won fifteen j
games without a defeat. The line-up is
as follows: Carroll, shortstop; Sullivan,
catcher; Dougherty, first base; Welsh,
third base; Bulger, pitcher; Tracy, left
field; Monahan. center field; Crawford,
second base; Walters, right field.
Pop Lockhead is in the game again
and demonstrated last Sunday that he
still retains his old time rapidity. His
style of hitting seems to have improved
materially.
Tim Shanahan, the star center fielder
of the Brewers, made the greatest catch j
seen in Sacramento this season in Sun- i
day's game. After a long run he caught
a hot line hit off Dean's bat when the |
ball was within a few Inches of the
ground.
Sykes, the tall first baseman, is com
pelted, owing to a broken linger, to retire '
from the game indefinitely. His retire
ment will be a severe loss to the Oak
lands, who at present are slightly on the j
toboggan.
Henessoy's return tp the game last Sun- i
day, when he played first base for the '
Brewers, was hailed with delight by all
the fans. In consequence the largest I
crowd of the season assembled to wit- j
ness the game, and gave "Doc" a very I
flattering reception. In return "Doc" j
played a beautiful game at. first and It j
is hoped he will remain in the game.
Catcher Peters, the clever backstop of !
the Stocktons, has been released. It is j
a mystery how sonic of these teams get
along. No doubt next week Peters will !
be heard from again catching for the I
tail-enders.
"Ham" Iberg is again in line, having
settled his troubles with the San Jose j
management. If McGucken's letter to I
Iberg was anything like the one he wrote \
me, I cannot see how he could refuse to i
return. Really, Me, I never gave you
credit for being such a clever fellow.
The superb manner In which Stultz is
holding down short stop for the AthleticÃ
has caused no end of speculation as to I
the team's pennant chances. It was j
rather weak at times in that position, i
but If Stultz can keep up his good work |
the team will bear very close watching.
Pyne should be played in the outfield,
as he will show to better advantage and
can do better work.
"Kid" Peeples is playing the game of
his life at third. He is. however, playing
in hard luck with the Stockton scorer, as
every time he goes there he has been I
charged with an error, when, it is said,
there was no possible chance for one be
ing charged to him. The "Kid" is gain-1
ing some reputation as a "bunter," and
occasionally works the hit and run. Vnis j
style of play is very scarce out here, and I
more of it would be appreciated.
Ed Hutchison, who was captain of the
Cedar Rapids team until it recently dis
banded, Is to be signed by the Gilt Edges.
They are determined to cinch that pen
nant.
There is no truth in the report that
j I^ockhead and Shanahan have been re
; leased by the Gilt Edge management.
I They are still on the pay roll, and will
continue to be so.
On Sunday, July 17, the Kohlberg.
| Strauss & Frohman baseball team will
; contest with the Watsonvilles at Watson
; viHe. for the benefit of the Red Cross
i Society of that town. The game prom-
I ises to be a good one, as both teams are
| very evenly matched. The last time they
; met It took Watsonville ten innings to
I win the game.
DROWNED IN THE BAY.
Body of Michael Hughes and an TJn-

The body of Michael Hughes, a laborer,
who resided at 214 Shipley street, was

wearing a beard on his chin well streaked

INTERNE ROBBED AT
HARBOR HOSPITAL
STRANGE STORY TOLD BY DR.
HOLLAND.
Stopped in the Darkness by a Tall
and a Short Man and
"Stood Up."
< A. F. Holland, an interne at the Harbor
Hospital, reported to Sergeant Cook of
the harbor station Wednesday that he had
been held up and . robbed on â  the . water
front by the well . known tall and short
man who generally figure in robberies.
According to Holland's story he left the
hospital, where he was on duty, early in
the evening and went up to Market street.
were he purchased some stationery. As
he returned to the hospital he noticed two
men, one tall and the other short, stand
ing between the hospital stable and -the
Harbor Commissioners' tugboat house. At
the hospital he wrote' some letters, and
about half-past 10 o'clock went to post
them. As he passed the stable the tall
man jumped out, grabbed him around
the waist and closed his mouth with his
hand. The short man reached into Hol
land's right pocket and took out $22, and
then the two ran up East street toward
Mission.
Holland says ne was dazed for a few
moments and walked up toward Market
some distance before he realized that he
had been robbed. When he made the dis
covery he reported his loss to the police.
Holland claims that he had altogether
$39 on his personâ the $22 he lost in one
pocket, two in another and fifteen in a
third. He says that when he passed the
men the first time he had his hands in his
pockets ' and supposes the robbers heard
it jingle.

Acted in Self-Defense.
The case of John Palmer, charged with
murder, was dismissed by Judge Mogan
yesterday on the ground that he acted in
self defense. On the night of July 2 Pal
mer and E. R. Patterson, a carpentwr, who
lived in the same house, 1155 Folsom street,
had a dispute and Patterson hit Palmer
on the head with a club, fracturing his
skull. Palmer closed with him and threw
him over the balustrade, causing his
death a few days later. Palmer was de

been requested to do so by the Judge.
MAY SEEK THE
ELUSIVE DEER
Open Season Ushered in
This Morning.
MANY MEN IN THE FIELD
DOVES IN THE LIST OF GAM<*
THAT MAY BE SOUGHT.
Shooters Are Promised the Best
Sport Enjoyed in Many Years
Owing to the Abund
ance of Birds.
Under the game laws of California, the
open season for shooting deer and doves
is ushered in this morning-. Many sports
men are already in the fields, but the ma
jority from this city will not leave until
this evening or to-morrow. Not for many
years has a season given promise of such
royal sport, and, unless all the subtle
signs known to huntsmen fail, the men
who go far afield will return with game
bags filled to repletion.
If reports are to be believed the coun
try Is teeming with doves and deer. The
past winter was a mild one. There was
but little snow In the Sierra Nevada
Mountains, so the deer have multiplied.
The light rainfall caused the small water
holes to dry unusually early this year
with the result that the deer will be found
in greater numbers near the large streams
than heretofore.
The members of the Country Club and
Mt. Tamalpais Club In Marln County are
promised excellent sport by their game
keepers, who have been zealous in the
preservation of the game under their
charge. Many parties will plunge at once
into the fastnesses of Mendocino County,
which is practically the home of the deer
in this State. A party made up of Her
bert Spencer, Charles Dletz. Lloyd Eaton
and F. Hoitting left on Thursday for
Hound Valley, Mendocino County.
J. Cadman will put his sporting for
tunes to the test in the field some forty
milr-s above Ukiah. Paul Delmas and
\V%i.im Berg will enjoy the sport pro
vldcu by the Mt. Tamalpais Club pre
serves.
John E. Richards and son left on Wed
nesday for Shasta in quest of deer.
Judge W. ~W. Morrow left on Tuesday
for Trinity County, and will be ready for
the elusive deer when the season is ush
ered in this morning.
Dr. C. W. Hibbard. accompanied by his
family, and George Hibbard leave to-day
for the Geysers. They will divide their
attention between deer and trout.
Doves are to be found in abundance
throughout the greater portion of the
State. They are particularly numerous in
the district about Walnut Creek, Dan
ville, Pleaeanton and Livermore. Merced
and Tulare counties will provide more
than their share of the birds, while to the
north, near Vacaville. the shooter's only
complaint will be that the birds are too
numerous. There are a number of fresh
water springs in this vicinity from which
the doves cannot be driven away.

lito mystery, in next Sunday's Call.
