SENATOR MORGAN
TALKS AND TALKS
FOR ANNEXATION
While Opponents of the Treaty
Are Hard at Work and Have
Already Secured the De
feat of the Scheme.
WASHINGTON. Ja~>. 19.â In
the face of the administration
claims of accessions to the Ha
waiian annexation policy, the
anti-annexationists Insist they
have the treaty beaten, and that
they have thirty-six votes
against it, instead of thirty
three, as they have heretofore
announced. They say also that
one other Senator is in doubt
and inclined their way. Senator
Thurston. Republican of Ne
braska, who is supposed to have
switched back to the affirmative
side of the question, they say
will finally vote against the
proposition.
The coming of President Dole
excites varied emotions in Wash
ington. President McKinley and
the leaders of the annexation
movement think his presence
here would be a decided help,
and holding that opinion, they
are going to make his stay as im
portant an event as possible. On
the other hand, the anti-annexa
tionlsts contend that he will turn
sentiment against the treaty.
They say he will be looked upon
as a lobbyist, and that his assist
ance will be regarded as officious
Intermeddling, and In that sense
an impediment to the treaty.
Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 19.
Senator Morgan of Alabama con
tinued his monologue on Hawaiian an
nexation to-day. Very few of his col
leagues listened to him, and the pro
ceedings were utterly devoid of inter
est. Even Senator Davis, the chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Re
lations, who has charge of the treaty,
spent most of his time in thfc cloak
room, emerging now and then for
courtesy sake.
There is no longer any doubt in the
minds of Senators familiar with the
situation that the treaty is doomed to
defeat, and this is why its friends are
now pushing the appropriation bills.
They hope to gain a little time.
Meanwhile the Washington Star is |
making bitter attacks on all of those ;
who are opposed to annexation. This I
paper is striving to make it appear i
that the sugar trust is at work here to j
oppose the treaty. But the Star's in
fluence counts 'fbr little.
Washington people know that it has
a selfish interest at stake. It is known
as the "trolley organ" because its pro
prietors are interested in the street car
lines in this city, and tne Washington
people are well aware that when the
Star is rampant in opposition to or in
advocacy of any bill pending before
Congress it has some selfish reason
for it. But the reason for the Star's
advocacy of the annexation treaty is
better understood among certain peo
ple in Honolulu than elsewhere.
MORGAN OF ALABAMA
SAYS MR. CLEVELAND
FAVORED ANNEXATION.
Insists He /s Right Despite the Fact That
the Record Does Not Sustain His
Position.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 19. - Senator
Morgan continued his spepoh in advo
cacy of the ratification of the Hawaiian
annexation treaty in the executive ses
sion of the Senate to-day. He an
nounced at the conclusion of to-day's
The San Francisco Call
session that he probably would require j
one more day in which to complete his |
presentation of the subject.
Senator Morgan dealt to-day with the i
question of the agricultural and com
mercial possibilities on the islands,
with the character of the present gov
ernment and with the position of the !
residents of the islands on the subject
of annexation. He repeated his asser
tion that President Cleveland was fa
, vorable to the acquisition of the Isl
ands and expressed the opinion that
it was his intention to have restored j
Queen Liliuokalani and to have nego- j
tiated with her a treaty of annexation.
He elaborated his views on this subject
!at considerable length, saying that
while he believed it was Mr. Cleve
land's intention to annex the islands,
he naturally changed his intention to
do this through the restoration of the
Queen when she made known her
. bloodthirsty disposition toward these
i who had dethroned her. He expressed
the opinion that Mr. Cleveland would
j never have taken such a positive po
| sition as he did take against the Dole
, Government and in opposition to an
nexation but for the antagonistic and
â  misleading report of Commissioner
I Blount.
The Senator was Interrupted at this
point by two or three Senators, who
were opposed to- the treaty, who wanted
to know if it were not true that Cleve
land had withdrawn the treaty for an
nexation made by the Harrison ad
; ministration. He admitted this was the
case, saying it was a matter of record,
but he still contended that under cir
cumstances entirely to his liking Mr.
Cleveland would have supported an
nexation.
Mr. Morgan had been convinced from
private interviews with the ex-Presi
; dent that he not only believed in the
wisdom of the annexation of Hawaii,
but that he would also have recom
mended the annexation of Cuba under
proper conditions.
Mr. Morgan took up the criticisms
i of the Government of Hawaii, defend
ing it In strong terms and eulogizing
Mr. Dole as one of the most competent
rulers of the time. He reviewed Mr.
Dole's history and said that gentle
man's record showed that he would be
a creditable head of any nation. He
i controverted the idea that the present
Government was, as had been charged,
a missionary Government, claiming
that It was in every way stanch and
enterprising and abreast of the times.
He concluded that the resources of
the country were such.' as to insure a
very prosperous future, and predicted
that Honolulu would at some time in
the not distant future attain to great
commercial importance, equal In all
probability to that of Hongkong or
other cities of like magnitude.
P RESIDENT DOLE'S
MISSION REGARDED
WITH DISFAVOR.
His Trip to This Country Causes Dissatisfac-
tion Among the Rank and File of the
Annexationists at Home.
HONOLULU, Jan. 12.â The main
topic of conversation everywhere Is the
departure of President Dole, and the
more the investigation is pursued the
more clearly is it learned that it is most
unpopular with thÂ» majority of the
rank and fik of the annexationists and
opposed by many of the leaders who
have borne the burden and expense of
the conflict.
It must be remembered that our
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, JANUARY 20, 1898.
Government was never constituted to
last longer than a few months, and yet
it has continued In power, principally
by the force of arms and contrary to
the will of the majority of the people,
for more than four years â an almost
extraordinary length of time for any
political party, and especially for a
Cabinet, to exist in Hawaii. Tropi
cal countries delight In change and
novelty, especially among their rul
ers.
For an aristocratic oligarchy it has
done well for our interior development
even if it has, by force of Its test oath,
decreased the franchise from 14,000 to
2657 to represent the interests of a pop
ulation of nearly 120,000 people.
Even to its followers, the 'admission
that in four years the Dole Govern
ment has proved the fact that Hawaii
can govern herself very respectably,
even under a revolutionary form of j
government, in face of a politically an- ;
tagonistic majority, and has entitled
that Government to the commendation j
of its foreign friends as the "best Gov
ernment Hawaii ever had." is thought
to be a very weak-kneed argument In ;
favor of annexation and the destruc
tion of this immaculate Government to
give place to a form of government
which at present is purely speculative,
and probably not yet schemed out in
the brain of any mortal man; but then
our pious friends tell us that "the gods
see everywhere," so that it may already
be arranged.
The Japanese Minister is awaiting
further dispatches from his home Gov
ernment before communicating with
the Hawaiian Government. He thinks
it may be several days before he will
be able to accord any information, as
he la not yet advised of his Govern
ment's wishes. The dispatches antici- '
Dated failed to arrive on the Peru. It
may be said, however, that the rela
tions between the two Governments are
very cordial and not at all strained, as
some dispatches are inclined to sug
gest.
It is sad to have to announce the
death last evening from heart disease
of Charles H. Eldridge. an associte of
the firm of William G. Irwin & Co.,
(limited) for the past eighteen years.
Mr. Eldridge was horn In Charlestown,
Mass., in 1842. He ser.ved with dis
tinction through the Civil War and
was wounded several times. He was
a member of the G. A. R.. of the Amer
ican Legion of Honor, of the Masonic
fraternity and of the Pacific Club.
A deputy marshal and a special of
ficer were sent to the leper settlement
at Molokal last evening, where dis
turbances are feared. The Govern
ment, yielding to the solicitations of
A. P. A. influence, so it is said, has re
moved the leading Roman Catholic em
ployes and replaced them with unde
sirable Protestants, in spite of the facts
of the devotion of the Catholic sisters
and fathers at the settlement for many
years: that four-fifths of the lepers
are Catholics and nearly 60 per cent of
our whole population are members of
that creed. The outcome is watched
with grave interest.
RHODE ISLAND SENTIMENT
SQUARELY OPPOSED TO
HAWAIIAN ANNEXATION
Even the Annexation of Texas Was Opposed
by the General Assembly of â¢
. , the State.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â T. L,. Cole
of this city, a dealer in old books, re
cently found a series of resolutions
passed by the General Assembly of the
State of Rhode Island In 1837, which
he thinks contain some sentiments ap
propriate to the present Hawaiian an
nexation discussion. In any event,
these resolutions Indicate the tradi
tional sentiment of New England upon
the subject of territorial expansion. It
is obvious that, aside from the enlarge
ment of State territory, Texas, being
contiguous to our own territory, fur
nished fewer objections than the Ha
waiian Islands do. It might be well
for Senators Aldrich and Wetmore to
look at these musty records, and see
where they possess pertinency to
the present discussion. They are as
follows:
Whereas, compact of union between
these States was entered into by the
people thereof in their respective States
in order to form that perfect union es
tablish justice, insure domestic tranquil
lity, provide for the common defense, pro
mote the general welfare and secure the
blessings of liberty to .themselves and
their posterity.
And therefore a republican government
| was instituted" by them, with certain
limited powers, clearly, specified and de
fined in a constitution, all other powers
not herein expressly relinquished beinjj
"reserved to States respectively or to
people."- . . â¢
And whereas, this limited government
possesses no power to extend its juris
diction over any foreign nation and no
foreign nation, country or people can be
admitted into this union but by sovereign

Special DlÂ»rat-h to The Call.
RANDSBt'RG, Cal.. Jan. 19â A fire
which started at 12:30 cr'clock this
morning in the rear of the Mojave Sa
loon on Rand street destroyed thirty
buildings and caused a loss of fully
$50,000. So far as learned thore was not
a dollar's insurance on any of the prop
erty destroyed. The fire consumed
everything on both Fides of Rand street
from Staley avenue to the Elite Thea
ter, and several buildings on Broad
way. This includes the postoffice and
some of the largest stores in the camp.
The cause of the fire is at present un
known.
The camp was Hltd from total de
struction by the absence of wind, hard
ly a breath of air stirring last night.
The homeless are all housed In tem
porary shelters, every barn in the
camp being utilized f<>r that purpose.
Mnny acts of real h> rolsm developed
last night. When hope seemed gone,
as the flames threatened the Broadway
Hotel, men faltered for a moment and
then climbed upon the burning build
ings and by main strength tore the
flaming boards loost* and hurled them
far away, to be scattered and extin
guished beneath the feet of other work
erÂ«\
Had thf fire crowed the street and
attacked the Broadway Hotel, the en
tire camp would have been burned,
and so all worked with the energy of
despair. But one accident worthy of
note occurred, and that was the case
of a man named Eness. who broke
through the roof of a burning build
ing and was quite badly burned on the
leg before he could get out.
The heaviest losers were the W. C
Wilson Company, about $20,000; Ham
mond & Co\, $3."00; T'nderhlll & Fores,
$4000; J. M. Crawford. $2000; S. J.

Some of the l<*ers are already pre
paring to rebuild, while others would
do so if funds were available.
MR. GLADSTONE
IN MUCH PAIN
Suffers From Neuralgia, but
His Strength Has Not
Departed.
Official Statement DeelaresThatThere
Is No Cause Tor Present
Alarm.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
LONDON. Jan. 19.â An official state
ment Issued to-night asserts that there
is no cause for alarm as to Mr. Glad
stone's health, but that it has not been
benefited as much as hoped for at
Cannes. The facial neuralgic pains per
sist with daily fluctuations, owing to the
cold winds and wet weather, but the
complaint is quite local. His physical
powers have not suffered: his strength
is good: his appetite excellent. He Joins
his family at meals and takes regular
drives, weather permitting. It is not
true that the family had been summoned.
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Gladstone will go
to Cannes Immediately in accordance
with an arrangement made weeks ago.
Lord Stuart Rennel, with whom Mr.
Gladstone is visiting, telegraphed to
night at 8:40 that Mr. Gladstone's health
was good.
The Westminister Gazette, although
minimizing the alarming reports con
cerning the health of Mr. Gladstone, is
"constrained to admit the fact that Mr.
Gladstone has suffered great pain most
of the time he has been at Cannes, being
unable to leave his sofa."
Continuing, the Westminster Gazette
remarks: "So far as the vital organs
are concerned, however, he is no worse.
On the other hand, continuous pain in
a man of Mr. Gladstone's age is undoubt
edly a symptom to cause anxiety."

LOS ANGELES
LABOR APPROVES THE CALL'S ACTION.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19.â Five thousand workingmen of L#os An
geles city and county, through their central organization, by a unani
mous vote to-night passed resolutions Indorsing the position the San
Francisco Call has taken with regard to the Los Angeles city water
fight and in behalf of the toilers, and thanking the proprietor of the
paper for the effort the paper is making to save the people and taxpay
ers either $2,000,000 or an extension of the lease whereby the rate pay
ers will for half a century longer be placed under the Iron heel of the
monopoly.
At its meeting to-night, all the affiliated unions being represented,
the Los Angeles Council of Labor, without a dissenting vote, adopted the
following resolutions:
"Whereas, The Los Angeles Council of Labor Is on record as favor
1 Ing municipal ownership, control and operation of a water distributing
< plant: and
â¢ "Whereas, All the officials of the city now In office were elected on
â¢ a platform pledging them to give their every effort and honest en

I "Whereas, Over a year has now gone by and municipal operation and
t control of a water plant has not been advanced one step, through the
t failure of those who should be the guardians of the people's rights and

â¢ "Resolved, By the Los Angeles Council of Labor, that we, as citizens
â¢ and taxpayers, demand that the Common Council of the city of Los An

OF AN EARTHQUAKE

the People,
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.â A special cor
respondent of the Herald writing from
Puerto Plata under date of January
10, says: To-day Santo Domingo is
lamenting the loss by an earthquake
which occurred on the morning: of De
cember 29 at a quarter to 7 o'clock. A
loud roaring noise was heard above the
sounds of wind and rain; then came a
violent shock of earthquake, continu
ing for about twenty seconds.
The shock caused a panic. Scores of
persons ran out of their dwellings In
their night clothing, and In a few min
utes shrieks and groans and shouts
were heard all over the city. While
the excitement still ran high at 1:30
o'clock In the afternoon of the same
day there was another shock and the
earth trembled at intervals until the
last severe shock, which was at 10:30
o'clock on the morning of January 2.
Since then up to last night we have
had several light shocks. The lower

classes have been greatly frightened
by the shocks and religious feeling runs
high. The priest of the parish. Dr. Ruiz,
was obliged to stop processions and
prayers and marching through the
streets at late hours of the right. All
Is now quiet, however.
A part of the village of Altamlre, fif
teen miles from here, disappeared dur
ing the earthquake. There was no
loss of life, but the cemetery has sunk.
It seems as if nature had dropped an
enormous pile-driver on this spot. The
tombs are destroyed and all in ruins.
In the hamlet of Guanabana. as a
woman walked out of her rancho. the
earth opened and she was swallowed up
to her armpits. With picks and crow- ;
bars she was saved from death, but !
is now a raving maniac.
The City of Santiago, of about 12,000
inhabitants, suffered greatly. Public
buildings and all of the business sec
tion were greatly damaged. A fine
and imposing building, costing thou
sands of dollars and completed after
thirty years' work, was so damaged
that it is doubtful if it can be repaired.
Many persons abandoned their homes
and as yet have not returned, fearing
further shocks. For three days all
business places were closed, the inhabi
tants giving themselves up to confess
ing their Pins, doing penance and pray
ing. The streets were crowded night
and day with processions, praying and
singing. Suffering is great, as there
has been no work for days, and the
poor, dependent on their daily labor,
are hungry. Ninety-two houses were
damaged.
In Jaibon and Esperanza thÂ» earth \
opened and .floods of water issued from j
the crevices, driving people from their '
homes, flooding estates and causing
great damage. It Is Impossible to
travel on the highways in this section
without encountering serious gaps in I
the roads. This section of country !
produces the best tobacco, and it is j
feared the crop may be lost. In Va- ;
varrette there are large cracks in the
earth, from which jets of water are !
are flowing. In Tamborlt and Jacagua '
springs of water appeared, but finally
subsided. It is said mountain* have
caved in and it is further represented I
that near there a volcano has ap- |
peared. This Information is con- !
firmed.
The damage done in the Province of
Cibao is hard to estimate, but it must
be fully $1,000,000. Since the earth
quake of 1842, which destroyed part of
this town and wrecked completely most
of the other towns and cities of this
Island, nothing approaching this has
been experienced.
MERRY AND SMITH MAY
LEARN THEIR FATE TO-DAY.
CHICAGO, Jan. 19â The case of Chris
j Merry and James Smith will go to the
! jury to-morrow. Merry expects no
mercy; Smith does.
"The jury will hang me," Merry re
peated many times to-day.
He made practically no defense. Merry
was deaf to all the arguments of his at
torneys. He feared the cross-examina
tion. He said repeatedly:
â¢'I don't know who killed Polly I did
not see her, have never seen her since
between 4 and 5 o'clock on Friday after
noon, November 19."
"Why not go on the stand and t%ll your
story to the jury?" urged Colonel David
son, his counsel. "You cannot hurt your
self, and you may benefit yourself."
Merry shook his head and declared it
I was useless for him to say a word. The
I arguments will be finished by noon to-
I morrow, and the case will go to the Jury
by a p. m.

lion dollars saddled upon them, for
which they would receive no value, or
the franchise and lease of the present
company was to be extended for a pe
riod of fifty years.
The reason the people have not been
awakened to the situation lies in the
fact that the three local dailies â the
Times, Herald and Express â were ab
solutely controlled by the water com
pany.
All avenues by which the people
could be reached were cut off until
The Call took up their fight and gave
the first complete and authentic state
ment of the exact situation that had
been published.
The result has been that for two days
the details given have furnished the
sole topic of discussion and now for
the first time is given the most start
ling intelligence that has yet been un
folded in this connection.
It has never been definitely under
stood just why the water company was
so desirous of delaying any and all
action that in any way tended to affect
municipal control and operation of the
distributing system. This has always
been the policy of the corporation and
of its three daily organs. Through
seven members of the City Council the
water company has been successful in
so blocking the progress of what, under
the contract, is a simple business plan,
that not one essential step to that end
has yet been taken.
The object of the delay Is to carry
out a scheme by which this generation
and the next one to come will be held
in the tentacles of the corporation.
"When the water company is forced to
do so it will give to the Council a figure
for which it will sell its plant. That
figure will be between $2,500,000 and
$3,000,000.
The idea is then to have its hench
men in the Council call a bond election
to vote the required amount of bonds
topurchase at the exorbitant figure. If
by any chance the bc-nds should carry,
the company would then be receiving
over a million and a half above what
the plant is worth. But it is well known
that any bond proposition giving the
water company more than a fair value
for its plant would be defeated. This
iis what the corporation desires. It
j would herald abroad the announcement
that the voters of the city of Los An
geles had declined to vote bonds to
! purchase a municipal water plant, and
: would say the result of the election
! clearly demonstrated that the people
did not want municipal ownership.
Then would come the deliberate be
trayal of a pubilc trust. The scheme
is to have the present City Council give
to the corporation a new lease and
franchise to cover a period of fifty
years, for which the company will give
to the city $1,000,000 in cash. Up to the
present time the water company has
seven votes in the Council. These mem
bers have always voted, as the corpo*2
ration wished. These seven votes
could legally vote the franchise
to the company and thÂ« Mayor would
be powerless to prevent it.

Company is anywhere from $400,000 to
$500,000 per annum. It in yearly in

years would be, at a moderate calcu
lation. $20,000,000. The $1,000,000 bonus
for such a franchise is nothing. ~
The water company's organs will
deny that any siuh scheme as this Is
contemplated or thought of. Never
theless, the plan has been so far ar
ranared that a syndicate has been form
ed to take the |lant after the fifty year
franchise has been secured and to give
$4,000,000 for It. Options have been se
cured on water company's stock with
this idea in view, and if the deal were
ever put through the parties who per
fected It would net one million dollars.
Now that the people are to be thor
oughly posted on every move and de
tail of this ficrht through The Call, the
consummation of this fdsantic fraud
upon the people can never be carried
out. The people are already aroused,
but with the news <>f this proposition
to deliver them over to the water com
pany for fifty years to come before
them they will never for a moment re
lax their vitrilanee until the water
negotiations are completed.
There are fifty-three stockholders of
the LOS Ar.gvles City Water Company
and there are 110,000 people in Los An
geles. The syndicated press â the
Times. Herald and Express â devoted
columns to weak and puerile explana
tions as to why they have pone over
to the protection of the interests of
those fifty-two stockholders to the ex
tent of robbing 110,060 citizens of mil
lions. Neither of these papers has the
audacity to controvert the facts set
out in The Call. They all declare for
municipal ownership now. but still
call for delay, delay, delay, as they
have for a year past. They also de
fend the Coundlmen who have voted
with the water company.
Out of their own mouths are these
thrt-'' papers convicted. The Herald
once was owned and controlled by par
ties other Than those who have it now
and it was not then a water company
organ. On January 11 of last year the
City Council, by a vote of 5 to 4. Her
man Silver casting the deciding vote,
refused to direct the City Engineer to
furnish an estimate "f the cost of an
entirely new water plant. This was the
tirst vote taken in the present Council
â which indicated that the water com-
pany had it.
The result of that vote aroused the
people and on January 12, 1597. the
Herald, commenting on it editorially,
said:
The basest feature of the human heart
is rev saled and cornea Into play as the
dominating factor when one betrays the
confidence "f his friend and neighbor
and delivers him over Into the hands of
a sworn enemy. Los Ar.geles nor any
other city Â« â â¢. r experienced such a bold
exhibition of perfidy, hypocrisy and
falsehood as was seen In the City Coun- i
cil yesterday, when five of the nine mem
bers with relish foreswore themselves
and tried to deliver Los Angeles over to j
the water company to be squeezed, taxed
and swindled to the utmost of the com
pany's desire.
Later, under extreme pressure, the
Council did just exactly what was
asked of it on January 11, but the
Herald had changed hands, passed un
der the domination of the water com
pany. It then entered on a policy of
condemning every step suggested
which tended to clear the way for the
city to acquire the water plant, and
its policy of delay was inaugurated
and has ever since been consistently
kept up. As illustrative of this fact
the Herald editorially says:
A report gained currency yesterday
that the City Council is to make arbitra
tion an immediate issue in the contro
versy with the water company. It
might be supposed that the Council had
made a sufficiently silly exhibition of its
prematureness when it insisted upon
making public the opinion of the City
Attorney ar.d his associate counsel as to
the validity of the contract with the
water company.
The Herald was utterly opposed
then, and is now, to the people know-
Ing anything about the status of their
case. The people well know that the
water company was posted as to the
validity of the contract, hut the Herald
was unwilling the people should know
how its legal advisors regarded the
matter. This outlined its policy in
keeping the facts away from the peo
ple. The Evening Express, on the
same lines, editorially said on Septem
ber 21:
The calm, long-range judgment of the
majority of the people of this city will
be that a mistake was undoubtedly made
In making public the opinion of the City
Attorney and consulting- counsel as to the
validity ot the city's contract with the
Los Angeles Water Company.
Then the Herald became alarmed, on
the 25th of November, lest something
should be done whereby municipal
ownership would be furthered, so it
printed a labored editorial defending
the policy of the seven subservient
Councilmen, in which it said:
It is to be regretted that there is an
apparent disposition in some quarters to
bring the water question to an acute
crisis.
It then goes on and endeavors to
Fhow why it should not be done. The
Express has lined up with the Herald
and the Times bag, since !ast July,
led the van in making the water com
pany's fight.
In an editorial printed to-day, the
Times says 1t has always claimed that
municipal ownership was certain to be
brought about. But on the 28th day
of last November it did not think so.
for it editorially said then: "Municipal
ownership of the water supply system
Is a possibility of the future," and then.
In a column of space, gave its reasons
for indovsing the policy of delay, and
argued that not until after July 20. 1898,
could anything be done.
The exposures made by The Call have
forced the syndicated dailies to defend
.themselves, and in a labored way they
attempt to do so. But the people know
where they stand, where they have
stood in the past, and where they have
got to stand in the future â on the side
of the water company.

BRALY'S CASE
FOR EXAMPLE
Dubious Methods of Los
Angeles Political
Purifiers.
How Lewis Thorne Was Knifed
in the Interest of the War
rant-Shaver.
Jugglery of the League for Better City
Government in Selecting a
School Director.
Bpeelnl Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19.â How the
League for Better City Government
does "pure" politics is beautifully ex
emplified in the case of School Director
J. H. Braly. According to the state
ment of a former member of the
league, Mr. Braly's nomination us
school director in the Fifth Ward was
conceived, executed and consummated
in fraud by certain members of the
board of directors. The documentary
evidence to prove this lies in the re
cords of the league, but access to them
has been absolutely refused, not only
to The Call's correspondent, but to
members of the league in good stand
ing. C. S. Walton, the secretary, in re
fusing access to the records, is evident
ly simply obeying instructions of the
board of directors.
Judging from the circumstances con
nected with the nomination of Braly,
never was a candidate more anxious
than he to secure a nomination and
election. This anxiety has caused the
more comment as the office of school
director is without emoluments, and
Mr. Braly himself has said that the
"shaving" of teacher*- warrants was
not engaged in by his bank as a mat
ter of business, but simply as an ac
commodation to the teachers.
At the last city election the League
for Better City Government had an en-
tire municipal ticket in the field, with
the exception of a candidate for Mayor.
Some of these candidates had the nom
ination of the league alone, while oth
ers on the ticket were the nominees of
either the Republican or Democratic '
party and were only indorsed by the j
league. But all nominees and indorses
had to be balloted for by the league
members, or had to be formally nor- j
mated or indorsed in itie league con- ;
vention. In case any candidate failed |
to receive a majority df the ballots, the j
selection of the candidate was thrown
into the convention.
According to the bulletin issued by
the league on October 7, 1896, nomina- !
tions had to be filed between 9 a. m. ;
on October 7, and 5 p. m. on October 14. j
This bulletin further stated that each
nomination for a city office had to be
accompanied by a document signed by
twenty members of the league, or of i
the ward clubs allied with the league,
such document being virtually a peti
tion asking the candidate to stand for
the nomination.
Up to 5 p. m. of October 14 only one
nomination had been filed with the
league for School Director in the Fifth
Ward. This was in favor of Lewis
Thorne. Thorne is the secretary of the
Republican County Committee, presi
dent of the Young Men's Republican
League and secretary of the Sixth Dis
trict Agricultural Association. Every
name on Thome's petition was that of
a resident of the Fifth Ward. Accord
ing to the plan adopted by the league
this insured the indorsement of Thorne
by the league.
Thorne was too good a Republican,
however, to suit the directors who con
trolled the league. He had already re
ceived the nomination of the Republi
; can party, and his indorsement by the
â  league would have insured his elec
; tion. Under these circumstances, trifles
: like violations of the regulations
adopted by the league, the signing of
; other people's names without their
knowledge and treachery to a fellow
; member were not allowed to stand in
the way.
There was a meeting of the beard of
directors of the league on the night of
; October 14, which lasted until a late
| hour. After some of the members left
for home a plan was conceived and car
ried out by those who remained to get
up a petition among themselves nomi
nating certain persons for School Dl
' rector for the Fifth "Ward. One peti
tion was drawn up on which the names
of four candidates were placed. This
action was taken about 11 o'clock at
night, or six hours after the time fixed
by the league for the closing of nomi
nations. The four persons named as
candidates were J. H. Braly, B. R.
Baumgardt, J. P. A. Petsch and Fred
Walton.
The balloting for nominees was done
by mall, each member being sent a
: ticket which contained the names of
all the candidates for each office. After
marking his ballot the voter remailed
it to the league and it was opened and
counted by the central committee of
the league. The candidate who re
ceived a majority of all the votes cast
for any particular office was at once
declared the nominee of the league for
that office. If no one candidate re
ceived a majority his selection was
thrown into the convention which met
later.
It is charged that the idea of the di
rectors in fixing up a petition with four
names on It as nominees for School Di
i rector in the Fifth Ward was to pre
i vent a choice by ballot and thus trans
! fer to the convention, which the execu
! tive committee expected to control and
1 which it did control, the selection of
i the candidate.
What added to the iniquity of the ac
tion taken by the members of the board
of directors on this occasion was that
there were only sixteen of them pres
ent. As already stated it required
twenty names to be attached to a pe
tition to make it valid. In this emer
gency it is charged that H. W. O'Mel
veny, who was a member of the exe
cutive committee, signed the following
; names of four members who were not
present: Frank A. Gibson, J. R. New
berry, Charles Forman and John F.
Francis.
As was anticipated, no one of the
! five candidates got a majority, and the
! convention subsequently nominated J.
| H, Braly. To further show that this ae
j tion of the directors was not taken
i with an honest purpose In view, bur
simply to defeat Thome, the fact la
cited that the names of four candi
dates were put on the one petition and
that only three of the twenty names
attached to the petition were names of
members who lived in the Fifth Ward.
There was an understanding in the
league that each ward should nomi
nate its own Councilman and member
j of the Board of Education.
Another interesting phase of Braly>
candidacy for School Director was the
persistency and boldness with whir-h
he pursued the office, hunting it first
in the camp of the Republicans, then in
the Democratic convention, and finally
in the convention of the league. Hip
first effort was to secure the nomination
i from the Republican party. He attend
| ed a caucus, and his presence there
j caused the chairman of the meeting to
THE SAX FItAXCISCO CALL, TIIUESDAT, JAXUAEY 20, 1898.
seek him out to say to him that hia at
tendance whs an unexpected pleasure.
Braly wag asked if he had not made a
mistake, as he had always been known
as a stanch Democrat. Braly an
swered that he had left the Democratic
party and was then a Republican. Bra
ly was named by the caucus as a nomi
nee to attend the Republican city con
vention, but when the ballot was taken
he only had four votes to his credit, so
he neither attended the Republican
convention nor received the nomination
for School Director. He was afterward
nominated by the Democratic city con
vention, at his own request, and. as
already stated, received the indorse
ment of the league.
This is the member of the School
Board trho is held up as a model by
the syndicated press of Los Angeles,
and who is defended by these same pa
persâthe Times, the Herald and the
Express â after he has been shown to be
guilty of a felonious act while serving
as a School Director. This is the man
who F. K. Rule, the president of the
League for Better City Government,
says has committed no violation <<t the
law in "shaving" teachers' warrants at
his bank.
When H. W. O'Molv.ny was asked to
day If he had attached the names of
Messrs. Gibson, NVwhnrry, Forman
and Francis to the petition previously
mentioned he replied that h>* had no
recollection of having done so. He de
clared that all the names attach* 1 to
the petition were the names of those
present at the time the petition was
siened, and that if the gentlemen did
not sign their names thems.-lv.s the
names were attached by thHr author
ity. When a?rain asked the question
he repeated that he had no recollection
of having signed any other person's
name, and added, "but I would not
say positively." .
Frank A. Gibson, whose name is
said to have been attached to th>- pe
tition by Mr. O'Melveny, said that he
had heard of his name beinpr \. need
thereon, that he did not see the p< ti
tlon and therefore had no direct
knowledge on the matter, and that if
his name was placed thereon by Mr.
O'Melveny it had been placed there in
g-ood faith.

who extended to him a cordial invitation
to the White House reception to-night.
The doctor accepted.
The protest against the confirmation of
the nomination of A. A. Withrow as
postmaster at Santa Clara was received
by Senator Perkins to-day and filed with
the Postoffice Committee of the Senate.
Among the signatures is that of the State
Senator from that district and the editor
of the Santa -Clara News. The petition
ers allege that Withrow is a non-resi
dent of the city of Santa Clara. Con
gressman Loud, upon whose recommen

peared before the committee to-day and
made an argument advocating his con

BROOKLYN NAVY
YARD SCANDAL
More Trouble in Store for
the Officers of the
Station.
Accused of Fraud in the Pur
chasing of Marine
Supplies.
Contracts Let at Exorbitant Prices to
Merchants Who Returned a
RaUe-Off.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: An in
vestigation of another scandal in the
Brooklyn Navy Yard will commence
to-morrow. Under orders issued by
Secretary Long a court of inquiry will
convene to determine upon whom
rests the responsibility for alleged
questionable practices which have pre
vail, -d for several years in the marine
barracks. The court will be composed
of Captain Merrill Miller as president
and member and Lieutenant Com
mander J. D. J. Kelley as recorder.
The matter was first brought to the
attention of the department by a
Brooklyn merchant named Wallace,
who charged that the officers were
guilty of fraudulent practices in en
tering into contracts for supplies. The
department directed an investigation
by an officer in whom it had confidence
and it is understood that in his report
be substantiates the merchant's
Â» h;irsrt-s. From what can be learned
the charges are of such a grave char
acter that there is a possibility of
court -nmrt ials for both officers and en
listed men, resulting from the inves
tigation.
It appears that the charges center
around the methods pursued by the
marine barracks in making contracts
for supplies. For instance, if a lawn
mower were in the account, Mr. Wal
lace charged that an enlisted man. act
ing as clerk, would go to a favored
merchant and inform him that ar
rangements would be made whereby
he could get the contract provided he
would engage to give in return 10 per
cent of the contract price. The clerk
would then invite the merchant to bid
"n the lawn mower and would send
similar invitations to two of his em
ployes. The merchant would bid an
excessive price on the lawn mower,
but the clerks would bid higher, and
he, being the lowest bidder, would
consequently be awarded the con
tracts.
Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Higbee is
the commandant of the barracks. It
is alleged that the practices extend
ovor several years, and that many en
listed men concerned have been dis
charged. Another matter brought to
the attention of the department was
that of an officer in the barracks, who,
it is alleged, contracted for three stoves
for the barracks, but instead of being
supplied with stoves the barracks were
furnished with grates. All papers in
the matter have been referred to Cap
tain Miller and Lieutenant Commander
Kelly.
GOVERNMENT ECONOMY
WHICH DID NOT PAY.
Brooklyn Nary- Yard Dry dock A/most Use-
less Because Constructed
of Wood.
NEW YORK, Jan. I?.â A dispatch from
Washington to the effect that Represen
tative HlH.orn of the House Naval Com
mittee w.iuld introduce a resolution call
ing for Congressional investigation of al
leged defective construction of the Brook
lyn navy-yard drydock created something
of a stir among the officers at the yard
to-day.
One of the officers said- that sue. a com
mittee as Representative Hilborn would
have appointed could do no more than
numerous engineers connected with the i
Bureau of Yards and Docks, who haa ex- j
amined the dock when completed, and |
they all agreed that the dock was faulty
in construction. â  They had long ago de
cided that If the dock was to be saved
it could only be done by converting it
into a composite dock by concreting. It
had long ago been agreed by engineers
who had examined the dock that the real
secret of faulty construction lay in the
fact that the Government had attempted
to practice false economy when it ordered
a wooden drydock Instead of one of stone.
The reason assigned at the time the plans
for the big dock were adopted for build
ing it of wood instead of stone was that
the cost of a wooden dock would be less
than half that of a stone dock. The fal
lacy of the argument now was apparent,
and that was about all that any Congres
sional committee could get out of an in
vest iEatiun.^^^^^^^^^^^^
DOCTORS DIFFER AS TO
MRS. CREEDE'S SANITY.
Experts for the Defense Take Issue With
the Physicians Who Testified for
the Contestants.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 19.â 1n the Creede
will case to-day the defense began with a
line of expert medical testimony to
prove the opposite to what physicians
who had testified for the contestants had
stated.
Dr. Kurtz stated that he would not
conclude under the conditions given that
Mrs. Creedo was of unsound mind at the
time that she signed the contract. On the
contrary, he said, her morals might be
depraved by her long-continued use of
morphine and her intellect still remain
unclouded. Her mind, he said, would not
be affected by the use of the drug until
after physical decay.
1 ft. Hughes was examined along the
same lines as Dr. Kurtz. He stated that
after hearing Mrs. Creede testify upon
the witness-stand since the trial began
he believed that she was a person of per
fectly sound mind.

STORMY STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING.
Badly Muddled Affairs of a Building and
Loan Association.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19.â There was a
stormy meeting to-night of the stock
holders of the Union Building and Loan
Association of this city, the oldest con
cern of the kind on the coast. For some
time past there have been load oozn
; plaints heard from stockholders regard-
I ing the management of the association's
j affairs, and matters were even more
I complicated recently by the failure of E.
K. Alsip, the secretary and one of the
leading managers for many years.
At to-night's meeting the committee
appointed recently to investigate its af
i fairs reported that there had been negli
gence and mismanagement. Grove L.
Johnson attacked the board of director*.
, whom he wanted ousted from office and
; prosecuted. He also demanded thai sev
eral of the stock series be repudiated,
also the overdraft of $100,000 at one of the
nanks. Xo action was taken on these
matters, but a committee was appointed
to confer with San Francisco parties who
offered to take hold o f the association's
affairs and lift the concern out of the
mire.
JUDGE E. B. HALL PASSES
AWAY AT SANTA BARBARA.
Suddenly Succumbs to Kidney Troubleâ Was
a Leading Member of the Bar of
the County.
SANTA BARBARA, Jan. 19.â Judge E.
B. Hall, one of the moÂ« prominent resi
dents of this county and a leading mem
ber of the bar, died suddenly this morn
ing from kidney trouble. He was a na
tive of Virginia and in the 76th year of
his age. I
In the early seventies Judge Hall came
to this city and began the practice of
law. Before coming here he had been
prominent during the war in the State
of Virginia and was a member of the
convention that framed the constitution
for the State of West Virginia, being one
of those to take the constitution to the
United States Congress for ratification,
tor this act a price was- put on his head
r>y the Confederate authorities. Judge

AN ARMOR PLANT
Secretary Long Estimates the
Cost at About Four Mil
lion Dollars.
Bids for Its Construction to Be Opened
on the Twenty-ninth of
This Month.
Spocial Dispatch to The Tall.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 19.
Secretary Long, accompanied by Chief
Constructor Hichborn. Chief O'Neill of
the Bureau of Ordnance and Judge Ad
vocate Lemley, appeared before the Sen
ate Committee on Naval Affairs to-day.
The Secretary said in response to ques
tions that the Navy Department had pre
pared full plans and specifications calling
for an armor plant under the last naval
appropriation bill, and that estimates on
the cost of land, tools end machinery
necessary to equip the plant had been
adopted. The bids were to be opened on
the 29th lnst., and he thought several
bids would be made.
Secretary Long said also that in view
of the report of the committee which he
had appointed to consider the question
of a Government armor plant and its re-?
port upon the great cost and delay it
would tarblVft, he had entered into fur
ther negotiations with private an.*Â»>r
plants now furnishing armor for other
ships, and he believed that he could make
a contract for the supply of armor plate
for the Illinois, Alabama and Wisconsin,
now under course of construction, which
would be ready whenever the ships were
ready to receive it. at the rate of $400 a
ton. The Secretary recommended, in
view of the circumstances, that an ar
rangement to this effect should be
adopted.-
From the Secretary's statement, cor
roborated by statements from Commo
dore Hichborn and Captain O'Neill, it ap
pears that the cost of a Government
plant properly equipped would be from
t3.500.fxw to 14300,008. He said that this in
cluded machinery for making armor
plate, guns and projectiles.
DEMAND FOR DRIED FRUITS.
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.â The Journal of
Commerce will say to-morrow:
There continues a brisk consuming demand
for California dried fruits, and the tendency of
the market Is upward. The chief Interest at
present centers In prunes, supplies of desirable
sizes of which are reported to be small.
Ordinarily at this time of the year the con
suming demand la light, and under pressure
to dispose of surplus stocks prices have gen
erally a downward tendency. This year it
would appear that surplus stocks have been
disposed of through the demands of foreign
trade, and at the present time offerings of
nearly all kinds, either on spot or for ship
ment from the Coast, are said to be small. A
large part of the export business in prunes.
It Is stated, has been drÂ»ne directly from the
Coast this season, owing to the favorable rates
made by the transportation companies.
Next to prunes, peaches seem to be the most
attractive article on the list of California dried
fruits, cheap stockp have been closely ab
sorbed. It Is reported, and the views of the
holders of what remains are very firm and the
tendency of prices Is upward.
About the only article in the line of Cali
fornia dried fruits which shows any lack of
Interest at the present time Is raisins, but
these latter are held firmly, as stock of good
quality in all positions is reported to be light.

C. H. RAYMOND
IS CONVICTED
The Redwood City Jury
Speedily Reaches a
Verdict
Murder in the First Degree and
No Recommendation for
Mercy. .
Must Haiiy With Winters, His Accom
plice, for the Andrews Murder
at Baden.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Jan. 19.â 1t
took the Jury just one hour this after
noon to find C. H. Raymond guilty of
murder in the first degree. In this
case, as in that of Harry Winters, the
jury failed to recommend the defendant
to the mercy of the court. Both parties
are therefore doomed to suffer the
death penalty for the murder of C. A.
Andrews, who was shot at the Grand
Hotel in Baden on the 17th of Novem
ber last.
Raymond took the verdict in a very
different manner from Winters. The
latter lost all control of himself and
denounced the witnesses who appeared
against him as perjurers, liars and
murderers, while Raymond appeared
wholly indifferent when the jury an
nounced its verdict.
Raymond, alias Moore, is an old ex
convict, having served a long term in
the California State prison and also
two terms in the State Prison in Ore
gon. Winters is also an ex-convict.
The two were well acquainted with
each other and the general feeling in
this neighborhood is that both have
met with their just deserts.
Winters will appear to-morrow morn-
Ing before Judge Buck to be sentenced
and Raymond will undergo the same
ordeal on Monday next.
Winters took the stand in his own
behalf and attempted to prove an alibi.
Raymond had no such defense, as he
was caught about three hours after the
shooting- within six or seven miles
from the scene of action. The latter
Introduced no evidence in support of
any defense, but relied wholly upon the
fact that the identification was incom
plete. The jury though was evidently
satisfied as to his guilt, as shown by
the prompt verdict rendered. They de
liberated a little longer in the latter case
than in the former, it taking them
but five minutes to convict Winters.
In the main the evidence in the case
of Raymond was but a repetition of
that given in the Winters case.

tion.
Patrick Ferriter, for the second time
in court, swore that he recognized Ray
mond on the stairs immediately pre
ceding the shooting.
Constable Fred Desirelli testified to
having seen the two men. Winters and
Raymond, late on the evening of the
16th in Baden.
Lieutenant Burke testified to state
ments made by Raymond to him when
arrested on the 17th of November.
Raymond, he said, told him he had
been in San Jose for the past two
months immediately prior to the fatal
occurrence in the Grand Hotel, and
yet it was proved that he was in Baden
a week previous thereto.
The result of the two trials has
given general satisfaction here, and it

these two men will greatly discourage

HAVANA, Jan. 19.â Aboslute calm
now reigns In Havana, and it is diffi
cult to realize that a few days ago the
city was apparently on the verge of
revolution. Although the rioting was
practically over on Friday night,
troops continued to be poured into the
city up to Sunday. General Bernet
arrived from Pinar del Rio on that
morning with a force estimated at 2000
men and bivoucked in the railroad
yards in Prado, where most of his
s remain. At about the same
time a column of 1000 cavalry rode in
and found quarters in Curtel de le Fu
erza. In Cuba street, on artillery
wharf, batteries of field artillery were
planted in position to rake Cuba and
Chacon streets.
All public buildings along the harbor
front, from Plaza de Annas to Punta,
were crammed with troops and large bod
i> p of cavalry and infantry were held in
reserve in streets adjacent to Central
Park. It is estimated that fully 12,000
3 were in the city in addition to
the regular garrison.
There was much speculation as to the
cause of such extraordinary precau
tions in view of the fact that, the city
was apparently tranquil. An expla
nation offered for the concentration of
troops far in excess of the apparent
gravity of the situation is that General
o has determined to mobilize one
quarter of the volunteer force and put
lr Into the field in active service. If
he ever had such an idea, he has ap
parently abandoned it. A much more
probable solution is offered in the New
York Herald's Madrid telegram in the
papers received here this morning, stat
ing that the riots were the result of a
Conservative plot in Spain to over
throw the ministry ard General Blanco
and enforce the return of General
W.-yler.
There is no question that the bitter
est feeling against < ".r-r.eral v Blanco and
autonomy is entertained in Conserva
tive circles and among .volunteers and
In the army. Volunteer officers are
open in expressions of hostility and
regulars are no less hostile, but are
generally more guarded in their utter
ances.
A regular officer said yesterday that
G> nf-ral P>lanco would have to go, and
if the regulars were ordered to fire on
thn volunteers or the people, he be
lieved they would refuse to obey.
I learn that General Blanco has been
distinctly notified that the army will
not permit the Government to extend
air] to reeonoentrados while loyal sol
diers are suffering from want of sup
plies. Circulars are daily distributed
in the streets and cafes calling volun
teers v arms to avenge insults put on
loyal Spaniards by the new regime. A
bomb was exploded on Monday night
fit Infanta and Monte streets, but no
damage was done.
All American papers were again held
in th? postoffice to-day. Many citizens
complain that thefr letters have been

remonstrance to General Blanco and
later got his papers. To-day his papers

Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, Jan. 19.â The Investi
gation Into the charges of bribery In
connection with the recent Senatorial
election reached a crisis to-night. No
matter what may be the final result of
the investigation, there will likely be
several witnesses arrested for con
tempt. They had seven witnesses sub
penaed for to-night, but they were not
all examined because none of them
would testify.
The Senate Committee last night ex
amined Samuel Pentland. proprietor of
the Neil House; Frank P. Ross, man
ager of the telephone company; W. F.
Truesdale, manager of the Postal Tele
graph Company, and Shepherd M.
Dunlap, manager of the Western
Union Telegraph Company, who then
asked to confer with their attorneys
and were excused until to-night for
that purpose. When they appeared
to-night they said their attorneys held
that the Senate had no Jurisdiction in
the investigation of the bribery of a
member of the House and had advised
them not to answer any further ques
tions before the committee. They all
followed the advice of their attorneys,
as did Mr. Hollenbeck, who was not on
the stand last night.
When the committee found that the
advice of the attorneys was being fol
lowed uniformly by all witnesses called
the open session was closed and the
committee went into executive session
to make plans for further procedure.
The Senate chamber was crowded
while the committee in open session
attempted to examine witnesses, and
the action of the witnesses caused de
monstrations of derision. The wit
nesses did not decline to tell the name
of their counsel, and their replies
showed that most eminent lawyers had
been engaged in the case.
The members of the House investiga
tion committee were present by invita
tion and they were requested to ask
questions, but none of them took any
part. Judge Robertson, who has
served with distinction on the beach at
Cincinnati, Is a member of the Senate
; committee, and is prosecutor. He wore
â  himself out asking questions and get
i ting the monotonous reply:
"On the advice of counsel, I decline
to answer."
Chairman Burke and Senators Lang
and Fink did their best to draw out the
witnesses, but to no avail. After the
four others took their turns Senator
j Garfield would close each examination
by askirrg:
"Do you decline to answer questions
because your attorneys say this com
mittee has no jurisdiction in this case
and have so advised you?"
The reply was in the affirmative and
the witnesses were excused. Each wit
ness was told that he was held under
service l>y the committee and should
report to-morrow night at 7:30, or
sooner if called for. As the commit
tee will make a partial report to the
Senate to-morrow a lively time is ex
pected. The committee will ask the
i Senate to punish the witnesses for COB
; tempt and to give the investigators
I full authority.
A. D. Hollenben of Chardon, Audiror
of Geauga County and member of the
Republican State Executive Commit
tee, was among the witnesses called.
Hollenben was asked repeatedly if his
son was not in the employ of Senator
Hanna, and if his son did not carry
funds from Columbus to Cincinnati.
Representative Otis resides in Cincin
nati and made the charges under
which the investigation was instituted.
He invariably refused to answer these
questions, doing so, he said, upon the
advice of his attorneys.
Shepherd A. Dunlap, manager of the
Western Union Telegraph Company,
was asked specifically for messages
signed "H. D." Mr. Dunlap, too, de
clined to make reply.
Frank P. Ross, manager of the tele
phone company, was asked about H.
H. Boyce. S. D. Hollenbeek and others
being called up at Cincinnati, but he
declined to- answer.
In response to subpenas Justin Wight
and Harry Ellinsworth, telegraph op
erators, who worked the wire at Sena-
\ tor Hanna's headquarters in the Neil
House, were present to testify, but the
i committee decided at 9 p. m. not to pro
i ce^d with any more witnesses who were
; under instructions of attorneys.
The committee then went into exec-
utive session to consider th<Â» extent of
its Jurisdiction in the investigation and
especially in the matter of punishing
for contempt. The committee was in
executive session from 9 to 11 o'clock
aid adopted, by a vote of 4 to 1, Gar
field voting in the negative, a resolu
tion to refer the whole matter back to
the Senate and adjourned for further
instructions and power.

PARTIALLY FROZEN
IN A CREEK BED
Fate of a Frenchman Who Had
Imbibed Too Freely and
Lost His Way.
SALINAS, Jan. 19.â A man found with the flesh frozen on him is a
remarkable circumstance for this locality in California. Word has been
received by telephone from San Ardo, a small town about twenty miles
from this city, that late yesterday the body of a Frenchman, Louis de
Leau, was found in the Poncho Rico Creek, paralyzed on one side and
the flesh on the back and hips frozen. Leau had been missing since Sun
day, and it was only by chance that he was found yesterday. Sunday
the man went to San Ardo, and while there Imbibed too freely. "When he
started for home a friend accompanied him for some distance. A trestle
had to be crossed, and his friend knew that Leau could not cross this
without assistance. He left him, however, after seeing him safely over
the trestle. This was the last seen of the Frenchman until he was
found yesterday afternoon. It is supposed that after losing his friend
the Frenchman was going along the creek bank and lost his balance
and fell in the creek bed. The man remained in this place, screened
from view by a Jetty. Here he passed two of the coldest nights of this
winter. Where his body came in contact with the gTound the flesh was
frozen. The man when found was alive, but could not speak.
HONOR THRUST
UPON WHITE
The Senator Popular With
His Party "Members

Offered the Chairmanship of the

Committee.
Undecided as to Whether He Will
Accept and Strive to Be Re

6pÂ«cl&l Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 19.
Honors come to Senator White of
California without his bidding. He was
chosen chairman of the National Dem
ocratic Convention at Chicago without
any effort on his part or on the part
of his friends. The majority of the
Democratic Congressional Committee
now favors him for chairman of that
committee, and has asked him to ac
cept. It is understood that the Sena
tor has the offer under consideration.
He would be glad to accept this hon
orable position but for the fact that he
is as yet undecided as to whether he
would be a candidate for re-election to
the Senate. He was Jn some doubt
about his acceptance to-night, but will
make known his decision to-morrow.
George P. Keenan, alleged to be a
Californian, and who has been acting
as organizer or "hustler" for the
League of Silver Clubs, and who is
also secretary of the National Commit
tee of the so-called "Silver party," has
evidently been disappointed in his am
bition to become secretary of the Con
gressional Committee, f<>r when he as
certained to-night that White was like
ly to be selected chairman of the com
mittee, he circulated around the hotel
lobbies trying to injure the Senator by
declaring that he was not a "good
Democrat." He repeated the lies of the
San Francisco Bulletin to the effect
that White. was supported by The '';:11
for re-election to the Senate, and
sought to discredit hts Democracy.
But Keenan is an insignificant figure
in Washington, tor it is well under
stood here that he is a political
"faker," whose expenses are bornp by
Mr. Lan*Â» of California, the wealthy
miner and silver advocate. Keenan is
the person who was roasted the other
day in the Washington papers by Law
rence Gardner and Senator Faulkner.

Says the Dominion Should Con

Defense.
Adds That the Day May Come When
Canada Will Have a "Rudo
Awakening."
Special Dispatch to The rail.
LONDON, Jan. 19.â Sir Michael Hi^ks-
Hia<h, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
speaking at Bristol to-day, ridiculed the
notion of providing granarlf-s, as had
been suggested In some quartern. HÂ« said
he was convinced the British navy was
strong enough to hold its own. and that
in any war England would have ii.any
friends to supply corn.
Referring to the coming budget esti
mates, ho said those would show that the
Government was fully alive to keeping
up the standard of the army and navy
although he declared it was nut creditable
to Canada nor fair to English taxpayer*
that such a colony should contribute
practically nothing to the naval d.fense
of the empire. He hnji.d Canada would
Boon turn her attention to this matter,
ridding that if she did not the day would
come when she would have a "rude
awakening', which would be entirely her
own fault."
In concluding his speech, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer announced that China
had approached England for assistance
to pay the Japanese indemnity, and that
the negotiations were still pending. The
newspaper statements on the subject he
characterized as inaccurate and inrom
plete. The Government was not ashamed
of these negotiations, and believed the
country would approve them. He could
see no reason why foreign powers should
object, but if the negotiations failed
Great Britain would take her stanu on ex
isting treaty rights.

counsel for deffendant asked for a post
ponement on the ground that it had
not had time to prepare its defense. To
this the attorneys for the Inter Ocean
assented, provided it was agreed on the
part of the Associated Press that no
action would be taken in the matter of
depriving the paper of news pending
the hearing of the petition, and the
motion for continuance was allowed.

His Arrest and Conviction Is Said
to Have Been Caused by Â«
Woman.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Jan. 19. â As a precaution to
prevent disturbances, the bridges from
the Latin quarter were to-day guarded
by police and the residences of Matieu
Dreyfus and Emil Zola were guarded.
A small mob of students assembled out
side the Law School with the usual
cries, but the police prevented a serious
demonstration.
There have been renewed demonstra
tions at Marseilles and other provincial
towns.
An anti-Jewish manifestation took
place at Nantes and Rouen, where
there were several arrests. It is said
that the student associations and com
mittees have resolved to abstain from
further demonstrations, pending the
trial of M. Zola.
LONDON, Jan. 10.â With every show
of authority the Pall Mall Gazette this
afternoon prints prominently an article
purporting to give the inwardness of
the Dreyfus case, and explains that the
document on which the Government
found the prisoner guilty was obtained
in the following manner from the Ger
man military attache. Yon Funckt:
"Nine or ten months before the arrest
of Dreyfus, Yon Funcke was suddenly
removed from his post. The explana
tion of his removal throws a curious
light on the Dreyfus case, and explains
In some measure the attitude of the
Government. When his predecessor.
Baron yon Huene, left Paris, he hand
ed Yon Funcke a list of persons in
France who were in relation with the
German intelligence department, en
joining him never to let it out of his
hand. Yon Funcke carried the docu
ment in a leather bag around his neck.
"Shortly after his entering upon his
duties a woman obtained the document
and took it to the Foreign Office, where
it was hastily photographed and re
turned to her, she returning it to Yon
Funcke. He had. in the meanwhile,
discovered his loss, and, like an honest
soldier and attache, he hastened to in
form the German Government of his
mishap, hence his recall.
"Curiously enough, the woman re
fused compensation, though a large
sum was offered her.
"With the photograph of the docu
ment the French Government went de
liberately to work, and I am assured
on authority that leaves no room for
doubt that the name of Dreyfus ap
peared on It, but it being a common
name in both Germany and France,
suspicion did not immediately fall on
the officer subsequently condemned.
Later it served as confirmatory evi
dence."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. Jan. 19.â Dr. S. L. Chapman.
ML W. Parker and A. M. Highrabedlan
filed locations on two gold mining claims
ytstt-rday. One claim is known as the
Flock and the other the 98. The claims
are adjacent and located in the Watts
Valley neighborhood in this county. The
parties are all residents of Fresno, and
they believe that they have made a rich
strike.
â¢â¢We believe." said Dr. Chapman,
"from assays of quartz taken from the
ledge last week that a bonanza has been
struck right here in Fresno County. I
took in two partners in order to develop
the mine, and will immediately com
mence the work of tunneling Into the
ledge."
The quartz exhibited by Dr. Chapman
was reddish, and sparks of very fine gold
could he seen in it by looking through a
magnifying glass. A careful assay will
be made of the quartz to-day, as the re
cent assay was not made with the best
appliances.

NO SENATOR
IN MARYLAND
Judge McComas Makes
a Slight Gain Over
Tuesday's Vote.
Not So Many as Had Been
Hoped by His Fol
lowing.
It Is Now Believed That Some Man
From Baltimore Will Be
Chosen.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANNAPOLIS. Md.. Jan. 19.â The
Senate and House met In joint session
to-day, and after casting one ballot for
United States Senator to succeed Ar
thur P. Gorman, adjourned until to
morrow. The ballot resulted as fol
lows: McComas 36, Shaw 11, Shryock
2, Milllken 2, Barber 6, Fourner 1. Gor
man 4, Findlay 2, Parran 6. Lowndes 1.
Total, 113; necessary to a choice 57;
absent 4.
The vote cast for Judge McComas
shows an increase over that received
by him yesterday. The outcome of the
day's balloting was a distinct disap
pointment to the followers of Judge
McComas, they having confidently ex
pected a gain of at least eight more
votes than they got. Their failure is
now thought to indicate the possible
reappearance of Postmaster-General
Gary as a candidate, as these votes are
looked upon as his whenever he wants
them.
A caucus of the Republican majority
will almost certainly be held to-mor
row night and an attempt will be made
to force the recalcitrants into line.
Thirty-one signatures have been ap
pended to the call, and it is asserted
that six more will be added before
midnight. Thirty-four are necessary
to secure a majority of the Republi
can members and Senators of the Gen
eral Assembly.
It is said Postmaster-General Gary
has requested his six supporters who
have voted for Thomas Parran to go
into caucus and abide by the decision
of that body. It is claimed that a ma
jority of the six have signified their
willingness to do so. To-night's devel
opments indicate that to-morrow's bal
lot will be a repetition of to-day's, and
indications of an attempt at coalition
between the "faithful eleven" and the
Democratic members for the purpose
of selecting a Baltimore city man are
growing stronger Â»very hour. Such a
combination would probably mean
Shaw or Malster.
HALF-STAR rÂ£O PEOPLE

Bread Riots Renewed in a //umber of
the Smalier Towns of
Italy.
ROME, Jan. 19â There were renewed
disorders to-day in the poor quarter of
Ancona. which is inhabited by anarch
ists and socialists. A number of men and
women attempted to barricade the
streets, but the police cleared the thor
oughfares and arrested several.
Troops are searching the country, ar
resting suspicious bands of tramps. The
agitation against the price, of bread is
spreading to other towns. A crowd as
sembled in front of the Town Hall at
Sinegala and demanded relief. The
Mayor gave a conciliatory reply, but the
mob, which consisted chiefly of women,
invaded the railway station and the
warehouses of Prince Ruspoli, where
they seized a quantity of grain. The
troops finally restored order.
There has been another slight disturb
ance at Maseota, about twenty miles
south of Ancona.
FIRST OFFICIAL RECEPTION
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION.
New Method of Distributing the Invitations
Proves a Most Satisfactory
Success.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â The first of
ficial reception of the present administra
tion was given at the White House this
evening. Aside from the fact that it was
the first, interest in the event centered in
the new method of distributing the invi
tations, so that only a certain proportion
of those entitled to the hospitality of the
executive mansion would be entertained
in a single evening. The plan, so far as
could be judged from appearances, was
an entire success. While 2000 invitations
had been distributed, and in spite of a
very rainy evening, every one who was
invited appeared, there was no crush in
any part of the house during the evening
and the whole affair was commented on
as one of the most pleasant and least
laborious of the Oig gatherings that have
occurred in the mansion.
The receiving party consisted of the
President and Mrs. McKlnley. the Vice-
President and IVirs. i.obart and the mem
bers and ladies of the Cabinet. All of
these were present except Secretary Al
ger, who was still too ill to venture out,
and Mrs. Bliss and Mrs. Long, each of
whom was represented by a daughter.

LIVELY DEBATES IN
HOUSE AND SENATE
CHAMPIONS
OF CUBA TO
THE FORE
Lively Debate in the
Lower House of
Congress.
Brucker Begins the Fight
With a Belligerency
Resolution.
Friends of the Insurgents Lack
ing in Numbers on a
Test Vote.
POSITION OF McKINLEY.
Desires to Give the Autonomy Plan
on the Island a Fair
Trl:.l.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 19.
All day long the question of granting
belligerent rights to the Cuban insurg
ents was argued in the House, but, as
on yesterday, the minority hurled itself
against a stone wall.
On the only vote taken to-day, a mo
tion designed to overrule the decision
of the Speaker and direct the Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs to report with
out further delay the Cuban resolu
tion passed by the Senate at the last
session, the Republicans stood solidly
and voted to sustain the chair.
The galleries, as on yesterday, were
banked to the doors, and there was
considerable excitement throughout the
early part of the session, when the
members of the minority were success
ively pressing their views bearing upon
the Cuban question for the purpose of
embarrassing the majority.
Brucker (D.) of Michigan asked for
â¢unanimous consent for the consideration
of a resolution which he sent to the
clerk's desk. The Speaker took >>. ca-
Bion to examine the resolution, and while
doing so Mr. Bailey, the leader of the mi
nority, loudly demanded that the resolu
tion be reported. The Speaker thereupon
directed the clerk to read the resolution,
which proved to be one instructing the
Committee on Foreign Affairs to report
â¢without further delay the Senate Cuban
belligerency resolution.
Like a flash Hitt, chairman of the For
eign Affairs Committee, was on his feet
with a point of order, which the Speaker
promptly sustained. The chair was then
about to recognize Hitt to call up the
diplomatic consular and appropriation
bill when Bailey demanded recognition.
"One moment, please," he called; "let
us first dispose of this question of or
der."
"The Chair sustained the point of or
der retorted the Speaker, testily.
"Then appeal," called Bailey across
the hall to Brucker, and the Michlgander
entered an apptal from the decision of
the Chair.
All was Instantly excitement and con
fusion. A dozen members were on their
feet demanding recognition to debate the
appeal, but the Speaker recognized I'al
zell. â who miivni to Lay it on the table.
This cut off debate, and tne Speaker put
the question. On a rising vote the Re
publicans stood firm and voted by 107 to
94 to lay the appeal on the table. The
ayes and noes were then demanded and
obtained by Bailey, and the roll-call was
â watched with interest to ascertain
â whether all the Republicans were willing
to go on record as they had voted yes
terday in committee of the whole, when
no record of the voto was made. The
Democrats, who expected to see the Re
publican line broken, were disappointed.
The majority presented an unbroken
front. A\ hitf of North Carolina, the soli
tary colored member of the House, when
his name was called, declined to vote at
all, answering "present," but at the con
clusion of the roll-call he thought better
of his resolution and voted "aye." The
motion to lay the appeal on the table
was carried by 10* to 120. There was no
manifestation of approval oil the an
nouncement of thÂ» vote.
The House, on Hltt's motion, went Into
committee of the whole and resumed
consideration of the diplomatic and con
sular appropriation bill. As soon as the
first paragraph was read the struggle
was resumed. "Williams (D.) of Mas
sachusetts offered an amendment to di
rect the President to appoint three com
missioners to proceed to Cuba and if pos
sible to negotiate a treaty of peace, amity
and commerce with the republic of Cuba,
and appropriating J13.000 for the ex
penses of the commissioners. It was
ruled out of order.
Immediately after T,ewis CO.) of Wash
ington offered another amendment pro
viding that to emphasize the fact that a
state of war existed in Cuba, the Consul-
General at Havana be withdrawn and the
Government of Spain be notified of a
suspension of diplomatic relations at that
point. Hitt quickly raised a point of

tained.
"I appeal from the decision of the
chair," paid LewlÃ.
"And I make the point that the appeal
Is dilatory,' exclaimed Dalzell (R.) of
Pennsylvania.
"The chair sustains the point," ex
claimed Hepburn, who directed the clerk
to proceed with the reading.
Excitement was now at boiling point,
and Terry (.D.) of Arkansas shouted his
protest.
"Can it be possible that we have reached
the point where this side of the House
cannot appeal from the decision of the
chair?" he called.
Hepburn directed Terry to take his seat,
and the clerk droned on with the reading.
Lewis found a parliamentary way of dis
cussing the amendment, however, by
by moving a pro forma amendment to
strike out the last word.
Chairman Hitt of the Committee on
Foreign Relations made an extended
statement on the Cuban question when
the general debate on the diplomatic bill
opened. He reviewed the course of the
administration, the successful demands
for the release of American citizens, the
protest against the inhuman war methods
of Weyler and the effect of the concentra
tion of Cubans in towns. This showed
what spirit animated the President and
what might be expected of him. Hitt also
spoke of the autonomy plan and the dis
position of the executive to give It a fair
trial, notwithstanding the many doubts
heard throughout the country against the
sincerity of the Spanish Government.
A declaration of belligerency, he ex
plained, would allow Spain's warships to
hunt our vessels on the high seas. In the
existing situation, good men sympathis
ing with Cuba's cause were constantly
malring their way to the islands. Supplies.
guns and ammunition were going from
the United States. It was said that every
pouml of powder fired for the cause of
Cuba's freedom had come from this coun
try. Members, he said, might ask why,
with all these disadvantages in store tor
them, the agents of the Cuban republic
in this city desired belligerent right*.
"I could explain it." 6aid Hitt. "but I
prefer to do so in th*> words of one of
those agents to me. 'We know,' said this
gentleman, "that we have much to lose in
the matter of supplies, but we also know
that if Spanteh cruisers began to stop
American steamers it would not be long
before a hasty shot is fired. With that
shot public opinion In Spain and the
United States will plunge these countries
Into war. Then our battle will be over.'
"That, perhaps, is a very just argument
for the Cuban." continued Hitt, "but not
for an American. If we are to have war
l<-t us seek it directly, not be forced into
it by chance."
Hitt spoke of the Spanish authority in
Havana as tottering between armed
forces without and tumultuous riot with
in, but with impressive worts warned the
members that the vast responsibility of
action, with the momentous consequences
that might ensue, rested upon the shoul
ders <>f the executive, not on members of
Congress, who might be making speeches
f. >r public approval.
"Let us remember," said he, "that we
have a faithful pilot at the helm, and if
the ship of state is near the rapids we
should be patient and ready to support
him if he takes the step which the honor
and the interests of our country may de
mand."
Dinsmore of Arkansas, a Democratic
member of the Foreign Affairs Commit
tee, declared that the time had come for
giving the Cubans the recognition they
had so long sought. He arraigned Hitt
and the Republican side for all alleged in
consistencies in regard to their speeches
under the Cleveland administration, and
then branched off to the tariff. < ivll s>-r
vice, bimetallism and various other topics.
Returning to Cuba, he declared that no
act of this Government could bring war
with Spain, for a bankrupt monarchy.
which could not put down 55.000 r
Cuban soldiers, would not eater upon a
contest with the I'nited States.

achievements of this, dwelling particu
larly upon the release of all Ar
prisoners In Cuba, the change in the
Spanish war methods and the abandon
ment of the policy of concentration. He
maintained that the recognition of bel
ligerency was purely an executive func
tion.
"Did you not vote for belligerency In
the last Congress?" asked Sulser.
"I did," replied Adams, "bin then we
were seeking to protect American prop
erty; that property ta now destroyed. We
were seeking to free American prisoners;
they are now all free. This whole ques
tion is nearing a solution of its own
weight. Spain Is bankrupt. She cannot
send another man to Cuba. There are
riots In Havana. The handwriting has
aptM ared on the wall."
Berry (D.) of Kentucky eloquently
pleaded Cuba's cause. After 300,000
Cubans had gone down to their death
during the last four years, he said, it was
absurd for members to stand on the floor
of the House and deny that a btute of
war existed on the island.
"I don't fear war," said Berry. "I
think a little blood running wouid be
good for us. I,et Spain fire on the
American flag iust ono<> and the flame
will l>e kindled that will free Cuba."
"But what will happen to us?" asked
Mahany.
"Oh, we can take care of ourselves,"
replied Berry.
After some further remarks by Whe^er
CIÂ».Â» of Alabama, in favor of granting
belligerent rights to the Insurgents, the
committee rose and at 5 o'clock the
House adjourned.
GREY WANTED BY
MARIN'S SHERIFF
The San Francisco Prisoner an
Escape From San Rafael's
Jail.
Sheriff Harrison Will Demand Pos

Guest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 19.â There Is a Jail
cell in Marln County yawning for Bert C.
Grey, the young man who was yesterday
acquitted by a jury in San Francisco of
having taken part In the murderous as
sault upon Isidore Goulet, the merchant
who was almost beaten to death by thugs
on the steps of his house last September.
Sheriff Harrison will go to the city t'>
morrow to make a formal demand for the
prisoner, who was remanded by Judge
Wallace back to the safe-keeping of Sher
iff Whelan.
Young Grey is wanted by the Marin
County authorities. Grey first came into
prominence by stealing a bicycle In San
Rafael. T'pon the stolen wheel he at
tempted to escape, but Constable William
Trainor followed him to Cloverdale and
placed him under arrest. Grey was
brought to San Rafael, tried and sen
tenced to six months in the County Jail.
He had spent a few weeks of his term
when one night he ecaped from the jail.
He had sawed two iron liars off, and with
the use of a stout stick had bent them
sideways, making an opening sufficiently
large for him to crawl through. He was
next heard of in Santa Rosa, where a
policeman captured him, but Grey broke
away and disappeared, only to be again
heard of in connection with the Goulet
assault.

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, D. C, Jan. 19.
A spirited debate was precipitated in
the Senate to-day by the introduction
of a resolution by Hoar of Massachu
setts providing for an inquiry by the
Committee on Postoffice and Post
Roads concerning the recent order of
the Postmaster-General reducing the
forces of letter carriers in several cities
of the country. Hoar declared that
the order had had the effect of a dyna
mite bomb in creating consternation
among these men throughout the coun
try, while apparently all that was need
ed by the Postofflce Department was
an appropriation of $150,000 to maintain
the efficiency of the carrier service.
The debate took a wide range, Wol
cott, chairman of the Committee on
Postoffices and Post Roads, insisting
that many New England people, rep
resented by the Senator from Massa
chusetts, were responsible for the de
ficiency in the funds of the Post* nice
Department because they insisted that
the Government should carry second
class mail at enormous loss; and Allen
of Nebraska charging that tty Gov
ernment was annually defrauded out
of millions of dollars through the un
derweighlng of mail matter. The reso
lution, in a modified form, is still pend
ing.
Vest gave notice that he would move
to-morrow to take up for consideration
the Teller resolution, reported by the
Finance Committee, providing that
bonds of the United States may be
paid in standard silver dollars. Vest's
notice seems to indicate an intention
on the part of some of the Senators to
displace temporarily the Hawaiian an
nexation treaty, as it is evident, as
White of California said, that the con
sideration of the resolution would "re
cipitate some slight discussion."
Hansbrough called up a bill which
had been sent to the Senate by the
House, providing that receivers of pub
lic moneys should be responsible under
their bonds for all money received by
them from the sale of Indian lands.
The bill passed the Senate on Monday,
but Hansbrough's desire was that the
bill should be enacted into a law by
the passage of the House bill. The bill
was passed.
Tlllman presented a resolution, fur
which he asked immediate considera
tion, extending the authority of the In
terstate Commerce Commission s"o that
It might inquire to what extent railroad
companies Issued passes, whether the
railroads gave transportation for any
other consideration than cash, and
what arrangements they had with
newspapers regarding transportation.
Cullom, chairman of the committee,
objected to the consideration of the res
olution, as it would involve a long and
tedious investigation by the committee,
which was anxious to get some bills
before Congress during the present ses
sion. He said that he had no desire to
evade the truth in any part of the In
vestigation, but he was satisfied that
the committee now had sufficient testi
mony before it to indicate the need of
stringent legislation. It had been
shown, he said, that in the scalping
business not only outsiders but the
agents of some railroads were engaged.
"I do not want to Investigate
throughout the year," c said, "but de
sire to prepare some bill which will
cure the evils we have found."

SAYS MURDERER HOLMES
/S AMONG THE LIVING.
Weird Yarn Told by a Man Who Claims Phila-
delphia Prison Officers Juggled
With Justice.
CHICAGO, Jan. 20.â 1n an interview in
the Inter Ocean this morning, Robert
Lattimer. a well-known citizen of Engle
wobd, says:
"Holmes, the arch murderer of the nine
teenth century, who is popularly sup
posed to have been hanged at Philadel
phia en May 7, 189G, for the murder of
Benjamin P. Pltzel, is alive and well, and
engaged in growing coffee near San Para
maribo, in Paraguay, South America."
Lattimer asserts that letters have been
received from Holmes within the last few
weeks by a man with whom Holmes had
intimate business relations during his
residence in the famous or infamous
'â¢Holmes Castle." Lattlmer's description
of the means by which the Philadelphia
authorities juggled with iustice in aiding
in Holmes' escape reads like a chapter
from a wild romance but he tells his story
with such an air of verisimilitude that
he has succeeded in interesting many
Chicagoans, including the police, and says
an investigation will be set on foot.

LIBELED WITH
A SWINE'S EAR
How Farmer Ellis Resented
an Insinuation That He
Stole Hogs.
Hoisted a Portion of a Porker Beside
a Road With a Notice to His
Accusers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 19.â Alfred P.
Ellis, an old resident of Linns Valley,
high In the mountains of the north
eastern portion of Kern, was brought
to town Monday in custody of an of
ficer on a libel ehartre sworn to by Su
pervtsor Henry Bohma. a resident of
the same community. Linns Valley is
a preat hog raising country. Super
visors Bohma and T. E. Wilkes each
have large herds, nn<l Mr. Ellis has
some porkers. It has been an open se
cret for many years that the rich little
valley and its most coveted foothills
abound with hot; thieves that are hard
to catch. In consequence of this there
is a division almost bordering upon a
feud in the community. Bohma and
Wilkes are th*> friends of one side and
Ellis is not the enemy of the other.
Bohma and Wilkes are on the gui
vive, as is the MM with many other
neighbors, fur any movement in the
pork business.
Ellis has mining Interests. The other
day he killed several porkers and start
ed for the mines with their carcasses,
intending to use some for himself and
sell the remainder to miners. Bohma
and Wilkes learned of this, and, it ap
pears, concluded that something was
wrong. They followed the wagon in
charge of Ellis" boy: they passed it and
repassed it. each time taking a side
squint at the ears of the dead hogs on
the wagon. Finally they hurried away
and got an officer with a search war
rant and came back and gave the
swines' ears a legal examination. It
turned out that the ears bore the Ellis
mark. Then wagon and its contents
were permitted to move on.
Shortly afterward the elder Ellis
heard of what had happened. It made
the grizzly old mountaineer angry, and
in his desire to vent his wrath he pro
cured a shingle and another hog's ear
and upr.n the shingle inscribed:
'"T<> Henry I'.ohma and Tom Wilkes.
the Linns Valley detectives: Here
are some ears you did not find; you
had better come and examine them."
He tarked it along with ears upon a
tree beside the public highway. Bohma
passed that way and saw it. Bohma
swore to a complaint charging Ellis
with criminal libel. Kills was arrested
and brought here and placed under
$500 ball.
All the persons are considered good
citizens. Bohma represents the Third
District of this county on the Board of
Supervisors.

NEW WESTERN
UNION LINES
Important Extensions on
the North Pacific
Coast.
Communication With Port An
geles Will Shortly Be
Established.
Many Points Not Reached by the
Puget Sound Company Will
Soon Be Tapped.
Special Diipatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Jan. 19.â Work was com
menced to-day on an important exten
sion of the lines of the Western Union
Telegraph Company, and as a result
by April 15 the town of Port Angeles,
on the Straits of Juan de Fuca, will
be connected by another telegraphic
system with the rest of the world. On
Saturday last the contract for pole
construction was let in San Francisco
to F. H. Folsom of this city, and ac
cording to its terms his part of the
work will be completed as far as Port
Townsend in forty-five days.
The route is along country roads
principally, and when such is the case
the contract requires that Mr. Folsom
shall clear the right of way.
Of this sort of construction there is
a distance of about twenty miles.
There are to be six submarine cables
used in the completion of the line,
which is expected to be in operation
not later than May 1.
The land construction started to-day
at the elevator in West Seattle and will
continue to Alki Point, where the com
pany takes up the work of laying the
cable. The cable reaches to Reserva
tion Point, below Port Blakeley, to
which point the land line is carried.
Port Madison is the next move from
Blakeley, and another cable will be re
quired to cross Port Madison Bay. The
shore line will be continued to AKat-;
Pass and then another cable will be
laid across to Port Madison Reserva
tion. Then the line will be continued
to Port Gamble and Salisbury Point,
where another cable is to cross Hood
Canal.
Port Ludlow is the next stop of the
land line, and the fifth cable is over
Ludlow Ray, where the line continues
to Pert Townsend. When the metrop
olis of Lower Peninsula is reached the
Western Union line will turn and go
to Discovery Hay, where the last cable
of the line crosses. From Discovery
Bay to Port Angeles the route is over
land.
.Mr. Folaom'fl contract requires 3400
posts, running thirty-five to the mile,
and varying in height from 25 to 40
Teet, the average being about 35 feet.
Mr. Folsom returned from San Fran
cisco Monday night. While in that
city he endeavored to charter some
vessels to carry telegraph poles and
lumber from Puget St)und to Oakland,
but was unable to do so. The delivery
was also intended for the Western
Union Company and consisted of 4000
f>et. Mr. Folsom offered (4 50 per
thousand capacity, but Jo was de
manded, which he refused to pay.
Th^ Western Union has also other
connections In contemplation which
Superintendent Jnynes talked of when
he was here recently. It is a part of
the plan to extend the line from Seat
tle so as to enter Victoria and Van
couver. The experiment of laying a
cable from Port Angeles to Victoria is
deemed impracticable, owing to the
tremendous strain that would be ex
erted on the line by the heavy tides
and extremely rough water. The con
sequent determination is to reach Vic
toria in a roundabout way via Van
couver. At one time the lines now In
British Columbia were owned by the
Western Union, which had constructed
and operated them as far as the head
of navigation on the Fraser River.
These lines were turned over to the
Government at Ottawa and eventually
became part of the system controlled
by the Canadian Pacific.
The new line will more than double
the capacity of the present system up
and down the Sound and straits. Many
important places not reached by the
Pueret Sound Company that connects
with the postal service in this city will
be tapped, and where the single wire
is now so subject to being blown down
by high winds, cutting off important
communication and not always to be
depended upon, the additional service
of the Western Union will go a long
way toward removing the difficulty.
RICHARD GRAY'S LAST WILL.
An Estate Valued at $35,000 Be-
queathed to the Widow of
the Testator.
The last will of Richard Gray, an of
ficial of the Southern Pacific Company,
who died on the Bth inst.. was filed for
probate yesterday. At the time of his
death Gray was possessed of an estate
valued at Jtfo.OOO, which is summarized as
follows: Realty In San Francisco, $lfi,(M);
realty in Lake County, $7000; stock of the
Clear Lake Land ami Manhattan Lighter
age companies, $10,000; insurance policy
issued by the Connec -ticut Mutual Life
Insurance Company. $20i>0.
The will bears date of July 4, ISS3, and
by its terms the entire estate is be
queathed to the widow of the deceased.
Lucretia Minerva Gray. The sole legatee
is also named as executrix without bonds.
The fact that the children of the testator
were not named ks legatees under the
will is. explained by the last clause.
Which rfini as follows: "In thus be
queathing all my estate to my wife, to
the exclusion of my children. I am moved
by no want of paternal affection for
them, but by the belief that their own
interests will be better served thereby."
DR. HERBERT CAUGHT.
He Will Die on the Scaffold if Con-
victed of the Crime Charged.
Dr. Herbert Orpen. familiarly known as
Dr. Arthur Herbert, was arrested by
Deputy United States Marshal Gallagher
on board the steamship Australia on her
arrival yesterday.
Orpen is wanted by the authorities of
Auckland, New Zealand, on a charge of
murder for having caused the death of
Susan Harriet Campbell McCullom at
that place by means of a criminal opera
tion. The woman died on Christmas day
and on the same night the doctor left
Auckland in the steerage of the Alameda.
A message was sent around the world by
wire and cable to apprehend the doctor
for murder, and when the Alameda ar
rived a few daya ago the Marshal board
ed her, but found that Orpen had left the
vessel at Honolulu.
The prisoner is 55 years old, and d*.
clined to make any statement to the re
porters. He will be held here until the
necessary papers shall have arrived from
New Zealand. The punishment lor this
offense is death by hanging.
The Cuban Scare.
Although the diplomatic entanglement with
Spain over Cuba Is to some extent Influencing

serious complications. Nevertheless serious
complication with other maladies may be, ex
fiected to follow an attack of biliousness which

DOGS IN FRESNO
AT A PREMIUM

Clarence J. Berry Preparing to Lead a
Big Expedition From Selma to

Special Dispatch to The Ca'.l.
FRESNO, Jan. 19.â Clarence J. Berry
cf the town of Selma, who returned
from the Klondike with his wife last
July, is preparing to lead a large ex
pedition into that country next month.
He and members of his prospective
party are now actively engaged in col
lecting suitable dogs to haul the pro
vision sleighs on the frozen trails, and
other parties who are also preparing
to go to the rich country are alsa buy
ing, borrowing and begging dogs all
over town. There is at present a dearth
Of canines in Fresno and round about.
Berry's party will be composed of
men from Selma, which is his home but
Hi Rapelje of this city will also be a
member of the Berry party, as well as
his son and Mr. Berry's brother-in-law.
All have been out collecting suitable
dogs, and they have about 200 caninos
which are being broken to harness and
trained to draw sleighs. Those who are
engaged in training the animals say it
is not an easy matter to get them prop
erly broken.
The 200 dogs which have been collect
ed in this vicinity are all stout and
hairy animals. Some of them were
purchased at as high a price as $50,
they being household pets, but the own
ers were induced to part with them for
hard cash in round sums. Several of
the dogs brought as high as $30 and
$40, but the average price paid for suit
able Klondike canines was between $10
and $20.
The supply of dogs having good warm
coats has been about exhausted in
Fuesno, and the prospective Klondik
ers are looking elsewhere for animals
for the frozen north. Hi Rapelje's son,
of the Berry party, is now in the high
Sierras gathering dogs there, as, owing
to the colder climate there, nature pro
vides the animals with warmer coats.
Besides the Berry party, there are
several other expeditions from this
county going to the Klondike, and they
are also engaged in collecting dogs. A
large party under the leadership of O.
P. Garrison, a well known farmer, will
start on the first proximo. The party
includes Frank Neate, night clerk at
the Grand Central, and Al Wolcott,
Deputy County Clerk. They have thir
ty iL>gs now being trained, some of
which were obtained in Sao Francisco
and others in Tulare.
A. V. Warnekros and wife are also
preparing to start for Alaska to pros
pect for gold, and have secured an out
fit from the East, comprising a patent
life-saving boat. They, too, are buying
up dogs at good prices.

Another American ship captain is in

every one of the sailors had some kind
of a tale of woe to tell United States
Consul General Haywood. It appears
that First Officer Lund beat and
abused the men during the entire voy
age, and nearly all the A. B.s bore
some mark of his handiwork. After a
thorough examination the Consul found
that there was not enough evidence to
warrant an arrest, but he informed
Captain Graham that any of the men
who so desired must be paid off. Nearly

CATTON DEFEATS SPINKS.
By a Narrow Margin the Rock Island Boy
Wins in Thirty-Eight Innings.
rHICAGO. Jan. 19.â Cetton defeated
Spinks to-day in the third game of the
18-inch bp-lk line tournament by a score
of 260 to 249. This leaves the question as
regards the player who Is to be left out
tfae money still undecided. Had
Slinks won this afternoon he would have
been sure of fourth money, with a fair
chance /or third. His victory last night
over Schaefer gave him confidence, but
â¢ b, after getting warmed up, began
piling up the caroms in a most disheart
ening way and in the eighteenth Inning
took the lead with a clever run of 30.
Bpii ks came back with a pretty cluster
of 44. but the Rook Island boy was not
to he denied, and returned the compli
ment with a run of 34. to which he
added 56 in the twenty-first inning, prac
tically < llm'hing the game
Spinks made three double-figure runs
in the next ten innings, but offset them
with three singles and four goose eggs.
Then Catton in turn lost his grip, allow
ing Spinks to creep up on him. He, how
over managed to stay long enough to
run the game out in the thirty-eighth in
ning. The score:

THE CRUISER CHITOSE REfIDY TO LAUNChJ.
There will be launched from the Union Iron Works shipbuilding yards, for the Japanese Government, next Saturday
at 1025 a. m., one of the handsomest crutsera that has left the stocks in many a day. Her keel was laid on May 3,
1897 and on June 26 of the same year the first rivet was driven. The work of construction, under the supervision of
two' officers detailed by the Japanese Government, has proceeded rapidly, until now the vend is ready for launching. She
is 402 feet two inches over all. and her displacement is 4760 tons on a normal draft of seventeen feet seven and a half
inches. Her indicated horsepower is 15.500 and her speed will be twenty-two and a half knots. Her armament will be most
effective and the new cruiser will prove to be a most valuable addition to the Japanese navy.

A Vast Host Preparing
to Seek. Riches on the
Klondike.
Only a Select Few, However,
Will Have Their Dreams
Fulfilled.
To the Great Majority Will Coma tho
Bitterness of Blighted
Hopes.
The Klondike craze Is growing with
leaps and bounds. Old hulks that at
i other times men could not be pprsuad
| ed to go to sea In are being pulled out
I of their retirement and put Into com
mission. Steam schooners and col
liers are being turned Into passenger
i vessels and even an old bark that for
merly carried crude petroleum from
Ventura to San Francisco is being
fitted out to carry miners from Seattle
:to Dyea. River steamers for the Yu
< kon, there will be In plenty, but It Is
very doubtful whether all the people
j who have made up their minds to
â  reach the gold fields by that route will
1 ever reach St. Michael. At the present
time there is not half enough vessels
to carry all who want to go from San
Francisco and the Sound to Dawson
City via the river route.
Dawson City, however, Is not the
only Eldorado In view. At least one j
party will start the latter part of j
April for Kotzobue Sound and other ex
peditions to the same field are In the
course of formation. Captain B. Co- j
gan is at the head of the party that
will leave here on April 25. They have
bought the whaling bark Alaska, and
after receiving a thorough overhauling
on the dry dock she Is now having ac- ;
commodatlon for 110 passengers put In. j
Of this number of berths nearly all j
have been taken and the chances are j
another vessel will have to be put on
the route. Among thope going on the
Alaska are W. Alston Hayne Jr. and
a party of nine from Santa Barbara.
Mr. Hayne Is the County Supervisor
from that part of the country and is

After a desperate struggle with the

Besides that the vessel will carry
the machinery and lumber for a stern
wheel steamer, which will be called the
John Riley, and also the material for
a large frame building, which is to be
erected cm the Kowak River as a store
house. The agreement with the pas
sengers is that before starting In pros
pecting they shall assist in putting to
gether the steamer and In building the
storehouse.
The first stopping-place will be at
Cape Blossom. There the bark will be
left in charge of keepers and the John
Riley will be put together. All the
stores and the lumber for the house
will be loaded on her and then the
entire party will go- 200 miles up the
Kowak River. When the house is
erected all the provisions and stores
will be placed in it and the miners will
have then two or three months in
which they can do their prospecting.
The chances are that considerable gold
will be found, as it was always in the
summer months that the Indians made
their finds and afterward returned with
the nuggets to Point Hope to buy stuff
: from the whalers.
From Cape Blossom the Alaska will
i be sailed to Point Hope, which is only
135 miles distant, and from there will
, bring back to the Kowak River a sup
ply of coal for the river steamer. There
is a coal mine at Point Hope and Cap-
I tain Cogan says that it is a very supe
; rior article. Indians and dogs are there
i In plenty, so in that respect and also
! in regard to fuel the men on this expe-
I dition will be more fortunate than
those in Dawson City. The chances are
that all the sailors engaged to man the
"Alaska will desert in order to search
for gold and in that event Captain Co
can will bring the vessel back to San
Francisco with an Indian crew. When
north on whaling expeditions Captain
Cogan has often employed the Indians,
and he says they make first-rate sail
ors. On his way down he will stop at
St. Michael to bring back a party of
returning Klondikers.
The steam schooner National City is
to be transferred into- a first-class pas
senger steamer, and on February 7 will

from the boat and swam toward the
shore, but as he was heavily encum

freed himself from his rubber cloth

where he lay exhausted for some time
before he could make his way to the

pected to occupy more than six days,
and on February 7 she will be on her
way to I 'yea with a full passenger list,
as a hundred berths have already been
engaged.
The same company will dispatch to
St. Michael on May 1 the bark Rufus
E. "Wood. On May 15 the ship Eclipse
and May 25 the National City will take
up the running. Both the sailing ves
sels will carry coal in their lower holds
for the use of the company's Yukon
River steamers. The ship Eclipse will
not come back from St. Michael, but
will be anchored there and turned into
a hotel. Ail the passengers from the
company's steamers will be landed on
her and transferred to the river steam
ers on the arrival of the latter from
Dawson City. Also if the steamer from
San Francisco has not arrived when
the river steamers get to St. Michael,
the returning miners will be put aboard
the Eclipse to await the coming of the
San Francisco boat. Tiie launch Het
tie 8., now on the Yukon, will be used
as a tender between the ship and the
shore, so that the guests of the floating
hotel can come and go as they will. By

curred in transferring their baggage
from the steamer to the shore at St. Mi

Sound have been ready for the bone
yard for years, and not a captain in
San Francisco could be hired to take
them to sea. Some o? them are fairly
good; others again are regular death
traps, and yet these boats are to be put
in commission to carry miners from Se
attle to Dyea. Several boats have been
â old within this last few days, among:
them being the old Louis Walsh, Enoch
Talbot and now the old Theobald. The

used for nothing else was turned into
â i tank boat, and even at that she was
a failure, while the Theobald changed
hands many months ago. and was re
cently sold again for $1400. At that
time her new owners did not know
whether to break her up or turn her
into a coal hulk. It was found that she
was not good enough for the latter pur

tle her, but before anything was done
Si ittle people came along, and, it is
said, paid $5500 for the old-timer.
The bark Edward May, now on her
way here from the East, via Honolulu,
has been sold to Alexander & Baldwin
of this city. The purchase price is said
t.i )<>â  $19,006, and the vessel will prob
ably be put in the Klondike trade when
sh.> roaches this port. Negotiations are
dow pending for the purchase of the
ship Yosemite for the same trade, and
Captain Fullerton, who has been mas
ter of her for eleven years, has been
transferred to the bark Harry Morse.
A new master will command the Yo

trade.
Hawaii is also to send her quota of
miners to the Klondike. A corporation
calling Itaelf the Kohala Klondike
Company has been incorporated with
a capital stock of $50,000. and C. T. and
A. C Ostrom will arrive from Hono

streets Tuesday afternoon, and, repre
senting himself as Frank McKeen, ex
pressed a desire to make a draft on the
McKeen Savings Bank of Terre Haute,
Ind.. for $800. He explained to Cashier
N. T. Horton that he was a newcomer
here and expected to remain some
weeks to enjoy the mild climate. His
father, he said, was president of the
McKeen Savings Bank of Terre Haute.
A blank draft was handed to the man,
who went out. He came back soon af
terward and remarked that as he in
tended to buy a fruit ranch near San
Diego he had decided to draw on the
Terre Haute bank for his entire balance
of $2SOO, and would make the draft for
that amount.
This was done and the stranger left.
Before going, however, he told Cashier
Horton that he intended to leave yes
terday morning for San Francisco and
would probably have occasion to draw
on the amount as soon as the money ar
rived from Indiana.
"Could you oblige me with a check
book?" asked the man, pleasantly.
"Certainly," replied Cashier Horton.
"But you do not expect to draw any
checks before the money is placed to
your credit here, do you?"
"Oh, no," responded the stranger,
with a smile.
After the bank closed Tuesday after
noon the man calling himself McKeen
went across the street to the Santa Fe
ticket office and asked for a first-class
ticket to Chicago and return, with
Pullman accommodations. He told the
ticket agent, George L. Baker, that he

had been negotiating for the purchase
of a ranch, but had changed his mind
and meant to return to Chicago tempo
rarily. He expressed regret that the
Exchange Bank was closed for the day
and that he was unable to tender cash
for the ticket. Upon showing the
check book, in which it appeared that
he had $2SOO on deposit in the bank, the
ticket was handed over.
Later in the day the stranger gave
equally worthless checks in payment
for a bicycle and an overcoat, and this
morning boarded the north-bound
train.
Presentation of the checks at the
bank this morning caused the cashier
to wire to Terra Haute, when he re
ceived the reply that the only Frank
McKeen known to exist was in that
cify and had drawn no such draft.
Chief of Police Russell was notified
and he telegraphed to Chief of Police
Glass at Los Angeles, who arrested
the alleged McKeen late this after
noon. Chief Russell will go after the
man to-morrow.
After the forgery was discovered to
day a photograph of a noted crook

resurrected in the Exchange Bank
and seen to be an exact likeness of the
stranger now under arrest at Los An

SflN FRANCISCO TO THE FRONT.
APPARENTLY for some reason, but really for
a lack of reason, the Chicago Inter-Ocean has
been endeavoring to underrate the importance
of San Francisco as an outfitting point for Alaskan
and Klondike trade. In a recent issue it declared:
"The Golden Gate people have been caught napping.
While they have slept Seattle and Tacoma have
knocked the plums into their basket. Even Port
land, Or., feeling secure in a full share of the busi
ness, has failed to advertise and is in the same con
dition as San Francisco. In Chicago and the East
neither of these prominent cities is mentioned in con
nection with Alaska. It is their own fault."
If San Francisco is never mentioned in connection
with Alaska in circles where the Inter-Ocean is read
it is only because the Inter-Ocean does not publish
the news, and that is not the fault of San Francisco.
This city has furnished news, and lots of it, on that
subject, and all live papers in the East have given
their readers the benefit of it.
San Francisco has sent through the East a travel
ing committee to set forth the advantages she has to
offer to all persons going to Alaska either for pleas
ure or profit. She has prepared an exposition of
mines and mining that will be of immense value to all
who wish to study that industry through attractive
object lessons. Her merchants and her manufac
turers have advertised extensively in Eastern papers
but possibly not in the Inter-Ocean. She and her
people have done all that could be expected of them
to enlighten ignorance, and if ignorance remains it is
clear the press of the East has not done its duty.
The attempts of any paper in the East â or in the
West for that matter â to underrate the prestige of
San Francisco are of course unpleasant, but none the
less they are evidences that we are going forward.
Movement always begets opposition. Even the wind
opposes the advance of one who moves rapidly, and
under its new management the Inter-Ocean is windy.
By the resistance we meet we can measure the force of
our motion upward and onward. San Francisco had
praise enough so long as she sat idly Dy the Golden
Gate, and she is denounced now only because she is
going to the front.
We can make San Francisco known in connection
with the Alaskan trade even in the ignorant' circles
where the Inter-Ocean is read and forgotten, and we
are going about it in the right way. The Golden
Jubilee and the Mining Fair, taken in connection with
the revived enterprise and energy of our merchants
and manufacturers, are receiving large attention
throughout the country. Many of the most influen
. tial papers in the East have devoted much space to
these undertakings, and the city is now talked of
wherever the Pacific Coast is known or the Alaskan
excitement felt. It is only in certain cliques in Chi
cago that the Easterners are out of date on such
subjects.
It is perhaps a coincidence that the report of a
Southern Pacific accident due to a defective track,
and the report that the Southern Pacific was cutting
down expenses by discharging track-walkers, should
have appeared in the same issue of the daily papers.
It will have a tendency to render economy unpopular,
and economy is really a valuable thing.
The absurd plea is made that the method of
slaughtering calves by first hanging them on steel
hooks thrust through close to the tendons of
their legs is as merciful as has been devised. Anybody
advancing such a pica might by being strung up in
a similar fashion for a while be brought to a state of
mind approaching the lucid.
Now that the courts have decided that a man who
dies from accidentally taking poison is not a victim
of accident, they should have gone far enough to let
a wondering world know what did ail the man, any
how. Is there such a thing as an accident accidental
enough to win the acknowledgment of an insurance
company?
We learn with interest that a man arrested in
Dixon for being drunk was taken to the town pail,
and that his age was about 04. While these facts
seem surprising they are gleaned from an evening
paper which points with pride to a record for accur
acy.
The Golden Nugget and Jubilee edition of the Re
port appeared yesterday and fully bore out the prom
ise of being a good number. It contained twenty
eight pages, with many illustrations, as well as much
information most appropriate at this time.
Huntington's desire to secure American registry for
his ships is something which not every land lubber
can appreciate. But his desire to secure American
registry for the thousands of Chinese in Hawaii does
not need to be explained by diagrams.
The sailor who brought suit for $50,000 damages
and then shipped at regular wages, letting his suit go
by default, evidently indorses the common belief as
to the relative value of the bird in the hand and the
pair outside of it.
MORGAN fIGAIN.
SENATOR MORGAN is making his annexation
speech to the Senate in executive session. It
is on the installment plan and will last for some
time jet.
The Senator has got through the sugar part of his
argument and closed on Tuesday with blood. He
insists that we want the islands in order to get cheap
sugar. We pay now $100,000,000 a year for foreign
sugar, every pound of which # can be profitably raised
by American farmers and by white labor.
When the reciprocity treaty subsidized Hawaiian
sugar the total island product was 20,000,000 pounds
a year. It has increased now under a bounty taken
out of American taxpayers amounting to $8,000,000
a year, until the crop is 330.000,000 pounds per annum.
It is the habit of annexationists to say that this is
a small and inappreciable amount, but in fact it is
equal to half the entire cane and beet sugar product
of the whole United States for the year 1896.
It is wholly the result of the reciprocity treaty,
which taxes American beet sugar growers to main
tain and enrich their competitors in the islands. In
1896 we produced only 52,000.000 pounds of beet
sugar, so that Hawaiian planters, supported by tax
ing our producers of beet sugar, sent into their market
about six times as much sugar as our beet growers
produced. To say that such competition is not op
pressive of the American farmer is to utter a char
acteristic Morganism.
The Alabama Senator turned from sugar to blood
shed. He assured the Senate that refusal to annex
the islands will inevitably lead to an effusion of gore.
Why should it, and how will it? The Senator is in
the habit of seeing blood on the moon and elsewhere.
With France and England already bound in a solemn
treaty to let the islands alone, and standing therefore
in line with the United States in guaranteeing their
i'ldependence, what nation dare attempt to interfere?
There is none that will or wishes to. England is the
only power outside the western continent that can
cvtr menace us and she has her military base on this
coast at Esquimalt, in touch with coal and supplies.
How would possession of Hawaii strengthen us
against an attack made from that base? Senator Mor
gan quotes Captain Mahan in favor of taking Hawaii
a? an ocean military base, but he suppresses that part
of Mahan's argument in which he says that to take
it without an extra fleet to defend it and the construc
tion of vast fortifications to protect it would be "a
ruinous mistake. " If Senator Morgan intends ever
to be honest with American taxpayers here is a good
place to begin. Let him tell the truth, for a novelty,
and tell it all, as a sort of penitential offering.
Taking Hawaii means defeat of the rising hope of
the American farmer as a producer; it means taking
from him $4,000,000 to pay Dole's debt, and $8,000,000
a year to pay the island planters excessive profit, and
none can tell how many hundreds of millions in for
tifications and a navy.
Paying taxes is a necessity and not a luxury. The
American taxpayer is apt to get too much of it. Sen
atorial buncombe comes high, but we don't have to
have it.
IS THERE ANOTHER CONTRACT ?
THE fact that the Mission street Boodler and
Collis P. Huntington agree ou the subject of
Hawaiian annexation is a matter of more than
ordinary concern to the people of California. When
those worthies were last together they had a contract
which contemplated the general befuddlement of the
public. On its side the Boodler had agreed to abuse
the Southern Pacific only so much as might be neces
sary to maintain its character as an "anti-monopoly"
organ. On his side Mr. Huntington had agreed to
pay the Boodler $1000 a month for thirty months of
"advertising" which never advertised anything.
Mr. Huntington and the Boodler got along very
well for twenty-two months. Then the latter thought
it saw a chance to bleed the Southern Pacific more
copiously. It went over to the railroad strikers and
abused the corporation far more vigorously than its
"advertising" contract permitted. Thereupon Mr.
Huntington struck it off the payroll. This all oc
curred in 1894. The affair was kept a profound secret
by both parties for nearly a year. Then, apparently
angered at the Boodlcr's abuse, Mr. Huntington re
vealed the truth; the "advertising" contract was pub
lished and the Boodler stood convicted of being the
most contemptible of all boodlers â namely, a boodler
that will not stay bought.
Of course we are ignorant of the arrangement that
has now seemingly been effected between the Boodler
and Mr. Huntington on the subject of Hawaiian an
nexation. â¢ Naturally, if the latter has executed an
other "advertising" contract the fact would be kept
from us. The mainspring of contracts for editorial
influence is secrecy. Indeed the famous $30,000 docu
ment was, as we have already said, withheld from the
public for nearly a year after the parties to it had
quarreled. But we are far from considering that the
feeling between the Boodler and Mr. Huntington is
irretrievably hostile. The Boodler is a business
sheet and constantly out for the "stuff." Mr. Hun
tington has shown that in protecting the property in
trusted to his care he is willing to be garroted occa
sionally. What more natural, then, than that the two
should get together on Hawaiian annexation?
Certainly there is sufficient money in an
nexation to yield several profitable "advertis
ing" contracts. If Mr. Huntington succeed in
having his foreign ships annexed he will
make a good deal of money. It might pay
him to hire the Boodler to advocate Hawaiian an
nexation at a higher rate per month than $1000 â
though we must say that in our opinion $1000 a
month for its influence is a boom figure. The ques-
tion of greatest moment, however â assuming that
Mr. Huntington has negotiated another "advertising"
contract with the Boodler â is, will the sheet stay
bought? We are safe in saying that it will not stay
bought any longer than that condition con
tinues profitable. But has Mr. Huntington now
got it tied up so that Hawaiian annexation will yield
it no more than the price we assume he has agreed
to pay?
We discuss this thing from a moral standpoint be
cause the example of the Boodler in jumping its edi
torial contracts is calculated to reflect discredit upon
boodle journalism, besides setting a bad example to
boodlers generally. Colonel Mamma has no words
of contempt sufficiently withering to characterize a
boodler who will not stay bought.
An evening paper criticizes The Call for not having
favored the "useful and handsome" tunnel under the
main drive in the park. No such tunnel has ever
been constructed there. The elongated hole beneath
the drive is damp and unsightly, and people who walk
thereabouts cannot be induced to walk through it.
They prefer to cross the road at grade and take such
chances as there may be.
There is one step by which the Los Angeles League
for Better Government could yet win respect. The
possibility of disbanding is a thing to which its at
tention is invited as worth its while to try.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANTARY 20, 1898.
THE accounts given in The Call of the methods
employed by the State Board of Prison Direct
ors in disposing of the jute products of the San
Quentin institution establish one. fact beyond the
peradventure of a doubt. Whether wittingly or not,
it is certain that the directors have been used by the
bag manipulators of the State for their own profit.
The letter as well as the spirit of the Ostrom act has
been violated with a frankness which is amazing.
While it may be that the directors have not com
mitted an indictable offense, it is unquestionable that
they have laid themselves liable to removal for neg
lect of duty.
State Prison Directors are honorary constitutional
officers. They are appointed for ten years and they
receive no salary. The law prescribes their duties
with particularity. Among other things they are re
quired to do, astonishing as it may seem, is to at
tend to their business. The Wardens are their agents
in the management of the prisons, but the Wardens
have no authority to violate the law in their names.
The constitution authorizes the Governor to remove
them after a hearing for neglect of duty. The evi
dent intent of this provision is to make them attend
to their business or resign.
The most charitable thing that can be said of the
present Board of Prison Directors is that they have
left the duty of enforcing the Ostrom law and dis
posing of prison-made bags to take care of itself.
For this the Governor is authorized and directed to
deprive them of their offices. The first board ap
pointed under the constitution was removed by Gov
ernor Stoneman for offenses compared with which
the placing of the product of the San Quentin jute
mili at the mercy of the Pacific Coast bag ring is as
a mountain to a mole hill.
The jute factory at the prison was established for
the purpose of emancipating the farmers from the
thralMom of the local bag manipulators. It has cost
the State upward of a million dollars. There never
was any intention of making a profit out of it. The
purpose of the Legislature was to provide a means of
throwing upon the market annually a sufficient num
ber of grainbags to break up the "corner" by which
a few capitalists in this city used to fleece the grain
raisers of the State out of a million or so every year.
For a long time the prison product effected this pur
pose. Lately, however, the bag manipulators have
been getting m their deadly work.
It is the duty of the Governor to thoroughly inves
tigate this affair. The constitution, indeed, makes it
his duty to do so. If he find that the price of jute
bags has been managed by the Prison Directors so
as to play into the hands of the dealersâ whether de
signedly or not â he should not hesitate to at once re
move them. This he owes to the farmers of Cali
fornia.
THE LOS ANGELES WfITER FIGHT.
IF the terms of a contract arc binding upon the
party of the first part they are equally binding
upon the party of the second part. In this fact
lies the strength of the people of Los Angeles in their
effort to prevent the water company from defrauding
them out of a sum but a little less than two millions.
For thirty years the people have abided by the terms,
although as the city grew it became farcical for them
to accept SISOO annually from the corporation, how
ever fair these figures may have been for the adobe
village of three decades ago. The same contract
which gave the corporation the right to supply
water for a term, now about to expire, stated in the
plainest of words that the right would be at an end
in thirty years, and that then the plant must be
turned over to the city. Controversy arises because
the corporation does not propose to be bound by the
terms when they arc no longer satisfactory to it.
The duty of the Mayor seems to be to take posses
sion of the plant ;it the time specified. It is in his
rower to accompl^h this without violence, and no
means except such as the law provides will be neces
saiy. When he has done this the corporation can
demur, and to make a showing in court will have to
state why it objects. Then the arbitration provided
for in the original contract will be inevitable, and the
people can demonstrate that the property for which
the water company demands $3,000,000 is in reality
worth only a litt'c more than a third of that sum.
This has been made plain already in a thorough but
not wholly effective way. It needs to be made a mat
ter of court record. This having been done, there
will remain nothing for the company to do but accept
a fair figure and retire.
The situation in the southern city is peculiar. Pre
cisely the reason the daily papers there are on the
side of monopoly, just why they desire the people to
be fleeced for the benefit of a corporation which has
been receiving immense returns on a small invest
ment, there is no necessity to discuss here. It is
enough to know that the Los Angeles daily press
has been wooed and won by the seductive influence
of entrenched capital and that it dares not or will not
say a word for the people. It not only tries to aid
the water company in a scheme that is mildly to be
called nefarious, but to the efforts of others to see
that justice prevails responds with abuse, trying to
hide its own guilt in the clamor. That it has won to
its side the boodle paper of San Francisco is not sur
prising, nor docs this in any measure strengthen its
case.
The recent offer of the company to sell does not
appear to have been made in good faith. So far as
known the price demanded is still $3,000,000, and that
any sum approximating this will be paid is absurd.
The Call expects to see Mayor Snyder faithful to
his election pledges, and it therefore believes that in
July the water works of Los Angeles will be in the
possession of the city. Such was clearly the intent
of the framers of the contract, and any violation of it
must be in defiance of the popular wish and to the
ignoring of all principles of equity.
The men who go to the Klondike and accumulate
large piles of gold have reasons for being careful
when they get back to civilization. There are many
people so constituted that they would rather steal
the dust gathered by somebody else than go up north
and get dust of their own, and those people are just
laying for fresh arrivals from Klondike. It really
seems strange that so large a number who have been
successful in the Yukon region would, had they re
mained away from the fields, have certainly blown
out the gas.
There is general satisfaction over the appoint
ment of Ina Coolbrith to have charge of the Mer
cantile Library. The assistant librarian, who has
resigned rather than submit to what he is pleased
to term petticoat government, might have retired
with better grace had he omitted this remark.
The sister of Ãber, the man lynched in Nevada a
few weeks ago, writes to his lawyer to look for his re
ward in heaven. It must be conceded that this is
giving the gentleman a poor chance of collecting.
It would occur to the casual observer that the Bul
letin is in a position to say but little, and say it in
low tones, about the painful subject of libeL

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
The success of "Sapho" at the Opera-
Comique, Paris, -was enormous. Musi
cians vent from all parts of Europe to
witness the first performance, and agree
in pronouncing it a great work. Mas-
Benefs other compositions have been so
uneven as regards merit that much curi
osity was felt as to which of his othor
operas it would resemble. The box-omee
receipts are the most reliable test of a
work having found favor with the pub
lic, and these have averaged for the first
nine performances, with the three first
devoted almost entirely to the pres>
francs 50 centimes for each performance,
and the house booked in advance. Much of
the success of the opera is due to Mme.
Calve, who created tho role of Fanny
(Sapho). Arthur Pougin. the French
critic, writes: 'The success was brilliant

had a strange dream. I found myself in
a temple, where all the different Instru
ments of the orchestra had met together,
when the piano, with an arrogant air,
advanced and requested to be allowed to
enter. The Instruments made it submit
to a rigorous eXcimination and execute
after them different melodies and series
of chords, after which they finished by
declaring that it was not of their famiiy.
The piano at tirst felt very much re
buffed, and began to cry; but, taking
courage all at once, it declared with pride
that it was a whole independent orches
tra by itself, and did not require the other
Instruments. These, very much provoked,
sent it out of the room. I have endeav
ored to render this dream musically in
my third concerto (in G major). I had
also intended to give an explicative 'pro
gramme,' but persuaded that in this kind
of composition one auditor hears one
thing while another comprehends some
thing quite different, I have finally re
nounced trying to express the plan of my
compositions." Wise Rubinstein! It re
minds one of the piece of music which
was written to express an Englishman
changing his religion, quitting his coun
try and leaving his umbrella behind him.
And his horror when it began to rain!
A writer In the Menestrel speaks In the
folowing terms of Alphonse Daudet, the
celebrated novelist: "We need not re
trace the grand literary career of the
poet-novelist who has Just disappeared
so suddenly, torn from the admiration of
the world, an irreparable loss to France.
But we must not forget that two of his
iinest works have served the genius of
two of our most celebrated musicians.
First, the 'Arlessiene.' on which Bizet
threw the first rays of his glorious youth,
and yesterday this 'Sapho,' by which
Massenet has continued in so happy a
manner the musical series of his great
works. It was this last which led us to
revisit Daudet, whom we had lost sipht
of for many years. He was seated before
his desk, still with the beautiful Christ
like head of his early years, but the
abundant hair and wavy beard were
streaked with silver threads. 'Ah, good
day, friend; how goes the old house?'
And the conversation continued as if
twenty-five years had not elapsed since
It commenced. It is only in Paris such a
thing could happen. Twenty-five years
In the agitated and preoccupied life we
lead Is like a drop of water In the ocean.
And all at once death arrives. We know
each other, often love each other; have
the tame sympathies and the same
esteem, and there is scarcely time to see
each other or to say what one feels. The
only hope is in the hereafter."
Tn Germany there has lately been pub
lished a series of documents upon the
music at the court of Weimer, in the
seventeenth century, which have never
been printed before and which is very
curious. The first chapel of the court was
constituted in 1593. It comprised a chapel
master, two instrumentalists, a violinist
and a hue player and eleven singers, of
which three were soprano, two were con
tralto, three tenors and three basses. The
master of the chapel, who was named
Hans Heroldt, received annually 57 florins
(about ISO francs) with an extra florin
a week for his food, and besides that, 9
florins* in summer and six in winter for
his clothes. And lastly, so that he might,
on occasion, treat his musicians hospit
ably, he was allowed six measures of
grain, three barrels of beer, some game
and some wood. Quite a patriarchal ar
rangement. The pay of the musicians
varied from 20 to 30 florins a year; one
only, one of the contraltos, named Kusch
ler, was better paid, and received 52
florins, doubtless on account of her ex
ceptional talent: and this one, as well as
three of her companions, received, like the
chapel master, one florin a week for food.
A sad condition of affairs seems to be
reigning in London at present. In a let
! ter from John F. Runclman, the London
critic, the following passage occurs: "For
two or three years every musical soul has
been oppressed by the number of tickets
he has been asked to take as a favor.
A musical critic Is sometimes appalled
when he finds himself in possession of
j tickets for a dozen concerts on one day;
but fancy the state of mind of the ordi
nary amateur who has had the tickets
sent him, generally through a friend, and
who has to rack his brains for an ex
cuse for being so rude as not to attend!
And the last result of all this is that nowa
days no one will pay to go to a recital of
any sort. The public has been pauperized
by free concerts! It is scarcely fair to
place the entire blame for this state of
affairs on the shoulders of the piano man
ufacturers. There are others in search
of advertismentâ singers, players, recit
ersâand these will buy seats if they are
permitted to perform."
The fight over the fortune left by
Brahms still rages, and the number of
claimants increases. Hamburg and Vien
na both lay claim to it, the former be
cause he was born there, and the latter
because he spent nearly all his life there,
and on that account had forfeited his
German nationality. The Senate of Ham
burg proposes, in case of being put in
possession of the money, to devote a part
of it to erect a vast monument to the
composer, in one of the public places of
the city. Here is certainly a bizarre pro
ject. It appears that a great city,
wishing to honor a citizen, in
whom it takes much glory, is willing that
he himself shall pay the price of the
glorification.

"Varsity Football" is the title of a
striking and tuneful march by Gertrude
Voorheis, daughter of Senator Voorheis
of Amador. This pretty composition has
Just been issued and has already reached
a high degree of popularity among local
musicians, who declare it to be a very
meritorious and clever bit of work. It
has all the dash and swing of Sousa's
marches. The melodies are catchy, and
judging from the amount of praise that
has been lavished on it it is destined to
be one of the successes of the season.
FAREWELL TO FATHER SCANLAN.
Editor San Francisco Call: The parish
loners of Sacred Heart parish of North
Temescal would thank you for the use
of your columns to tender to Father Mar
tin P. Scanlan this proof of their affec
tion.
Rev. Martin P. Scanlan, now pastor of
the parish of Dixon, has been our as
sistant pastor for the past three years.
A big man with a big heart, he has en
deared himself to everybody, from the
old man to the little child, as the expres
sions of love and regret prove. Loving
and sympathetic to a fault, he has scat
tered among the sick and the poor un
der his care a good part of the small
salary he received. The splendid success
of our late fair was in no small part duo
to his efforts, and when lately our house
of worship was destroyed by fire he ex
cited our admiration by his energy in
getting means to rebuild our temple of
God.
Our Archbishop has taken him away
from us and given him a larger field of
action by making him pastor of the par
ish of Dixon. The change was sudden and
unexpected and few of us could shake
hands with him before he left.
Therefore, Father Scanlan, through the
Gall, we wish you GorJ speed. May God
grant you health and strength in your
new labors and crown them with success.
May your new parishioners appreciate
your great zeal and kindness, as do
THE PARISHIONERS OF THE SA

sorrowing parents, brothers and sisters of
the young man Edgar Allen Miller, who

THE SEX OF. TME ANGELS.
San Francisco, Jan. 17. IS9B.
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: In
your last Saturday's issue, last page, in
giving a description of the Breon arch,
you have the following: "On the main
passage is a figure of the guardian angel
of heaven itself spreading her divine in
fluence over the whole structure, etc."
Now, as a matter of fact, the Bihle
everywhere speaks of the angels as he
longing to the male sex. In the last chap
ter of DaniPl, first verse, is the follow
ing: "At that time shall Michael, the
great prince (i. c., the Archangel), stand
for his people," etc. In Revelation, chap
ter twelfth, seventh verse, is the follow
ing: "And there was a war in heaven.
Michael (the Archangel) and his angels
fought," etc. Michael is the protector of
Germany. Tours truly.

The Plaintiff Very Murth in Earnest

Since it was exposed in its attempt to
bunko the business men of San Fran
cisco the Bulletin has seemed to be
utterly reckless. Having no charac
ter to protect it appears to have for
gotten that others do have characters.
Thus it has been conducted into the
Police Court on a charge of criminal
libel. Isaac Trumbo is the complain
ing witness. Warrants were served
yesterday on Richard A. Crothers and
Fremont Older, who, in that unfeeling
document, are spoken of as editors,
proprietors and publishers. There is
no reasonable doubt that the Bulletin
has a proprietor and a publisher, but
symptoms of its having an editor are
meager. However, this point has noth
ing to do with the story.

With many an allegation shrouded

after close inspection and a lopping
away of useless terms, Mr. Trumbo af
firms that the Bulletin as represented
in the distinguished persons named
above published a "false, unprivileged,
malicious and defamatory libel." Thus
far the complaint excites no surprise,
but when it continues by asserting that
all this was don.- "in the English lan
guage," the tendency to take issue is
hard to repress. The Bulletin may
with fair show of reason be ae*
of doing almost anything but using the
English language. On this contention
it may rest a defense hard to shatter.
Yet there are other allegations. The
men arrested are accused "f printing
matter tending and intended to im
peacfa the "honesty, integrity, virtue
and reputation" of Mr. Trumbo and
expose him to "hatred, contempt, ob
loquy and ridicule." â 
The entire matter grows out of the
fairy story constructed by the even
ing sheet out of a rumor that Mr.
Trumbo had been sued for divorce. It
not only made this declaration, but
went into details which were new to
both principals and their lawyers. The
divorce suit had not been filed, there is
no assurance that any will be filed al
h such action is expected, yet the

them at luncheon. Covers were laid for
twenty, the President having the seat of
honor at the right of the Mayor. Sev

briefly referred to his mission to the

Soon after his return to his hotel Claus
Spreckela paid a visit to his old friends,
President Dole and wife. The friendship
existing between Mr. Spreckels and the
Doles was formed many years ago in
Hawaii, and questions of Island politics
there and public policy here have never
dulled the kindly sentiments then estab
lish. <1.
At the islands Mr. Spreckels was known
to his many friends as Colonel Spreckels,
and so he was greeted yesterday by the
I'resident and Mrs. Dolt? !n the old-fash
warm-hearted way. The visit was
delightful in many respects and afforded
Mrs. Dole quite as much pleasure as it
gave to her distinguished husband. In
the midst of the packing and prepara
tions for the Eastern Journey they talked
of old times in Hawaii, of mutual friends
and acquaintances, bat ncvor touched In
the slightest degree the subject of island
â  : ment. It was not decided until a
late hour Tuesday that Mrs. Dole would
accompany her husband to Washington.
In preparing for the journey she was not
equal to the task of going to the Presidio
-day with General Shatter's party.
Soon after 0 o'clock Mr. Dole, accom

WHY RAINEY
IS HUSTLING
A Sudden Call to the
State Central Com
mittee.
It Forebodes Things to Fearful
Raineyltes Here
abouts.
The Local Split May Make Business,
und Forty-Two Members
May Go.
The long roll was sounded yesterday
by Sum Ralney and his faction of the
local Democracy when they happened
to learn that a meeting of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee had
been called by Chairman Alford for a
week frotn next Saturday at 11 a. m.,
in this city.
The alarm manifested was due to a
fear and belief that the call foreboded
an effort on the part of the antl-Ralney
forces to take a hand in the local Dem
ocratic mesa by "purifying" the party
machine through setting the Sullivan
Democracy above the Rainey machine.
The fact that the discovery of the call
was accidental was due to the fact that
no individual notices were issued to
members. The call was promulgated
solely by publishing it rather obscure
ly in Tuesday's issue of the Examiner.
Not many learned of the unexpected
call on Tuesday. It was late yesterday
afternoon when Sam Rainey learned of
it, and within twenty minutes James
A. Fenton and others had been posted
off to see Major Harney and others,
and by closing time Raineyites were
chasing to the police court offices of
John F. McGovern and Robert L.
Mann.
The specific purposes of the meeting
as they exist in Chairman Alford's
mind are not generally understood by
members of the committee. The call
says simply:
"Business of importance to the party
is to be transacted, and it is hoped that
there will be full meeting of the com
mittee. This method of calling a meet
ing of the committee is employed as
being the surest way to reach all the
members."
"The meeting is probably to reaffirm
the principles of Jeffersonian Democ
racy," said a prominent member-at
large.
If that were it, Ram Rainey wouldn't
have to hustle. Whatever business of
this high importance may come up the
particular interest in what may be
coming is due to the prospect that an
effort will be made to declare vacant
and perhaps fill the seats of forty-two
of the 128 members who did not pay
that $30 campaign assessment last year.
This is one of the clubs which it has
long been rumored would be used on
the Raineyltes. Most of these delin
quents are country members, and Rai
ney might not be able to call a major
ity friends, but it would throw out
eight San Francisco members who are
very active Raineyites. and most of
them place holders. The removal of
forty-two members and the appoint
ment of forty-two new ones by an anti-
Rainey majority would be a swift blow
at the Rainey machine.
Another thing to be feared is the
formal recognition by resolution or
otherwise of the Sullivan Democracy
or the regular local machine. If
the primary law survives another
Supreme Court ordeal, as it is being
assumed it will, future party commit
tees will be chosen by the conventions
elected under that law, but such an in
dorsement of the Sullivan Democracy
would give it a prestige with Demo
cratic voters at the primary.
So the probability of the local party
split coming before the committee
makes local interest In the meeting
keen, and so the Rainev leaders yester
day began busily figuring up their
strength.
"I have no knowledge of what will
come before the meeting," said Major
P. J. Harney. chairman of the Rainey
Democracy, yesterday, "and do not
know if an attempt to interfere in lo
cal affairs will be made. The outrage
of throwing out forty-two members
might easily result in a new Demo
cratic State Central Committee, com
posed of these and others, who would
go out with them and compose a ma
jority of the committeemen chosen by
the people."
"I don't know what Is coming up,"
sail Max Popper, one of the stalwart
leaders of the Sullivan Democracy,
"but I think the delinquents will he
dropped from the roll. The matter will
necessarily come up o.* roll call at the
start."
Here Is the material and possibility
of a good old fashioned Democratic
meelee. Many efforts will be made to
keep the local squabble out of the com
mittee however.

Swedish Consul Replies to the
National Geographical Society
at Washiogton.
The account which appeared In The Call
of December 2<> must have excited con
siderable interest in scientific circles.
Judging mm the inquiry addressed to the
Swedish Consul in this city by the Na
tional Geographical Society. The tele
gram reads as follows:
"To Henry Lund, Swedish Consul. San
Francisco: The American Minister at
Stockholm refers me to you concerning
Andree's balloon seen in British Columbia
August 17. A full reply is wanted by
telegraph, and renly paid.
'GRAHAM BELL,
"President National Geographical Society,
Washington.**
Mr. Lund, wh^n seen last night, said
that he had immediately replied to the
telegram and the information contained
therein was mainly a synopsis of the
article published in The Call last month.
He said that the request for information
In repard to Andree's balloon, coming as
it does from so prominent a source, would
indicate that the venture of the daring
explorer and his companions was regard
ed as of great scientific moment, ana any
further news of their movements will be
eagerly looked for.
A Professional pootrace.
Several thousand dollors changed hands
on a foot race that took place at Sacra
mento on Tuesday between W. Li. Hey
ward of Oregon and Albert Shooks of
Fresno. It was a 100-yard dash and was
won by the Oregonian by one foot in
10 1-5 seconds. The race was decided on
a muddy track and the time consequent
ly was remarkably good. Doubtless the
runners gave fictitious names. There are
at present a few Eastern "track burn

GROCERS SPURN
EMMETT DUNN
They Refuse to Affiliate
With San Francisco
Travelers.
An Indirect Result of the War
With the Weighty " In
ner Circle."
J. C. Nobmsnn's Strong Language at
an Electionâ Trouble Over
a Picnic.
As an Indirect result of the war wa^ed
by Emmett Dunn, president of the San
Francisco Commercial Travelers' Asso
ciation, against the "famous eight" of
the California Commercial Travelers' As
sociation, the committee appointed by the
Retail Grocers' Association to represent
that body on the larger committee com
posed in addition of members of the
â¢Wholesalers' Association and San Fran
cisco Travelers, which had In mind the
making of arrangements for the big- pic
nic to be held in June, has withdrawn ab
solutely from affiliation with the San
Francisco Travelers.
On Monday evening the larger commit
tee met in B'nai Brith Hall. Here it was
discovered that Dunn, !n harmony with
his previous actions, had taken men off
the sub-committee from the San Fran
cisco Commercial Travelers' Association
because they were members also of the
so-called "Inner circle." The two men
taken off were Charles Fay and A. E.
Green. The two substitutes were C. C.
Miller and Dunn's own brother.
The Retail Grocers' Association was in |
favor of Schuetzen Park as the place of !
holding the big picnic scheduled for
June 8, and the California men would |
have so voted, but Dunn wanted the picnic i
held at El Campo. Realizing that his
two substitutes or lieutenants would vote
for El Campo the Retail Grocers' com
mittee refused to vote. This was a wise j
move, as they would have been defeated
by one vote.
Tuesday evening the San Francisco
Travelers held their semi-monthly |
meeting in the Alcazar building, i
When it â¢ was learned that the
Retail Grocers' committee had with
drawn and absolutely refused to af
filiate longer with the San Francisco
Commercial Travelers considerable con
cern was felt, as the Retail Grocers' As
sociation is one of the most, powerful
commercial organizations in the City. !
Even Dunn had to admit from the chair j
that this was probably so. The grocers' j
committee was composed of John Nob- I
mann, Joseph Stultz, J. J. Hayes, Super- I
visor Lackmann, E. I. Fleiger, Henry j
Rawe and John E. A. Helms.
In plain defiance of the by-laws, so far |
as casting a ballot was concerned, the j
IF THE RAIN WILL
ONLY STAY AWAY.
one and one which each member recog
nizes, but fears to bring up until the last
moment; It Is not stopping preparations,
however, and should the gods be un
propltlous the celebration will not by any
means succumb to the drenching from on
high. The most feasible way out of the
difficulty so far suggested comes from
Mr. Daniels of the parade committee. He
thinks If It rains that every hall in the
city within convenient distance and capa
ble of holding any kind of a crowd,
should be hired for the noon hours of
the day; then a speaker or two speakers,
or If there is a sufficient amount of talent
handy, three or even four speakers, could
be sent to each hall escorted by a brass
band, and from every quarter of the city
the patriotism and enthusiasm which
would have been typified by the parade
and which no amount of water can dam
pen, could be heard and participated In
.by the people, and the celebration could
go along anyway until the exercises in
the afternoon took up the tide of jubila
tion.
The parade will be started by the ap
pearance of an immense figure of Colum
bia, which will be outlined in fire five
hundred feet in the air. It will be formed
by the explosion of a bomb disco
from the corner of Market and Bansome
Street*. As the line moves along its p;ith
will be marked by showers of gold and
silver, serpents "f flame, golden dragons
and turtles and li.-l: ami birds and all the
known beasts of the air and the sea and
the field, and others, too, not so well
known, and seen only on occasions of
trr.-at festivity and celebration, and even
then only by a favored few of the most
roistering celebrants.
"Day fireworks" will be responsible for
this display, and it will bo a safe wager
that the procession will be quite as in
teresting far above the housetops as it
will be down on the street.
There Is another fireworks project on I
foot, but the question of funds is a more [
burning one than any fireworks can call
op, and bo the committee is only talking
of it as yet. ThÂ« idea is to have displays
of fireworks from three of the most
"eight" remain suspended. The by-laws
require that a vote on the question of ]
suspension must be carried by a tvror
thirds majority of all the members on the
roll, but Dunn ruifd that a two-thirds
vote of those present would be legal. He
had blanks already prepared. and it went
through. The men remain suspended. As
n result, the rest of the twenty will re
sign from the S.ni Francisco Commercial
Travelers' Association.
Last nipht the Retail Grocers' Asso
ciation held its annual election of di
rectors at B'nal B'rith Hall. The fol
lowing were elected as directors for
the ensuing year: E. I. Flieper, J. H.
Haarge, E. H. Hanjes, A. Irvine, John
Lackmann, John C. Nohmann, H.
Rawe, John Schloen, William "Warlike
and J. H. Witte.
It was decided hereafter to affiliate
with the California Commercial Trav
elers and to hold a picnic in June in
conjunction with them. J. C. Nob
mann made a speech, in which he de
cared that the split was wholly owing
to the machinations of Emmett Dunn.
"Dunn is the man," declared Nob
mann, "who is not content with the
odium he has acquired in dealing soar
bitrarily with the California Travelers,
but must needs carry his methods into
the grocers' camp. We will have none
of him."
CELESTIAL PREPARATIONS.
Their New Year Almost at Hand\
H Q ve a Week, of pire and
Decorations.
A large crowd visited Chinatown last
evening to watch the preparations now
going on for the new year, which begins
i"xt Friday. I'.ooths had been arranged
all along the sides of the streets and
China lanterns were lighted on all sides.
Chief of Police Lees will in all proba
bility have rÂ» lnrpe force of officers on
hand when the noise begins, and it is ru
mored he will give the Chinese but onÂ«
hour 'n which to fire off rackets and
Other fireworks. The hour In which this
happens will without doubt be exceed
ingly warm. The Chinese are making
more elaborate preparations than were
made* last year, as the police orders were
noted to the letter.
WHO SHOT GARDINER?
The Question Wll! Be Settled
Sooner Than Expected.
The preliminary examination of Adam
Stroh on the charge of burglary was
continued before Judge Conlan yester
day and after Policemen Meagher and
Floyd and Detectives Dillon and Crockett
had given tbelr evidence the prosecution
rested. This brought Attorney J. N. K.
Wilson to Ills feet and he demanded that
the prosecution should piace Frank Mur
phy, the patrol wagon driver, on the
stand as his client had also been charged
with assault to murder for shooting
Gardiner, the stockbroker, when the po
lice knew that Murphy fired the shot.
ProsecutiiiK Attorney Mogan demurred
to calling Murphy, as the assault to mur
der had nothing to do with the burglary
charge. Besides they had a sure case
without Murphy's evidence and he de
clined to have him subpenaed.
Wilson insisted and the Judge ordered
that a subpena be issued for Murphy's
appearance to-morrow, when it v.lll be
shown, who did fire the shot. By that
means the defense experts to get the
charge of assault to murder disposed of
at once.

prominent points of thÂ« cityâ Clay street
hill, Rlncon hill and the Market street
cvt â at which "day fireworks" similar to
those used In the parade can be set off.
Such displays would be most effective
and the cost for a display lasting over
three hours would be but $200 for each
station; but the $(>OO neressary is not in
eight and so the matter is awaiting Its
turn.
There are several other attractive feat
ures awaiting their turns and the tangi
ble assistance tendered by the people to
the finance committee. Children's day,
according to present appropriations must
get along on $500. Thore will be games
for which pome little prizes must be of
fered: them are entertainments to be
planned and provided and there is a
email lunch to be set for the boys and
girls who are at an age when such an en
tentalnment will nppe.il to them mist
strongly. On $500 the prizes must be very
small indeed, the entertainment must be
cut down to almost nothing and the num
ber of hungry children who can be fed
on the remainder could be stowed In the
dining-room of a small flat. The sub
scriptions have so far be^n as good as
could be expected, but there is a great

BOLD CRIMES
OF A DARING
BURGLAR
He Robbed His Vic

the Barbary Coast
for Him.
Residents of the Mission Apply
to the Police Authorities
for Protection.
KNOWN AS A HARD CROOK.
His Booty Derived From a Life of
Crime Is Estimated at Many
Hundred Dollars.
Two detectives from the Central sat
tion are Bcouring Barbary Coast for
j a burglar who has been operating In
I the Mission. During the past few
i weeks he has entered a number of
\ Italian vegetable gardens on San
, Bruno road and got away with valu
i able property belonging to the owners
,of the gardens. Ills booty has amount
! Ed to several hundred dollars.
Several day% ago the much wanted
burglar entered the house of an Italian
gardener on Mission r>>:nt and asked
for employment. He said he was from
Sacramento, and was In need of work.
He was given a place to sleep in a
cabin set apart for the hired help.
While the other gardeners were asleep
he went through their clothes, secur
ing several watches and a small
amount of money. He immediately
left the place and went to another veg
etable garden several blocks distant.
He told a sorrowful tale of being hun
gry and asked for something to eat.
He again worked the same scheme,
robbing three of the hired help while
they slept.
From a description given of him, the
police are convinced that he Is the man
the old Woodward's Pavilion, and hurry
and bustle tell of the preparations under
way there. The place is full of decora
tors and the carpenter** hammer plays a
merry tune during the hours of daylight.
The plans for the decorations are most
elaborate, and when carried out they will
have transformed the dingy, barn-like
structure Into a classic temple, golden
huod and draped with flags and beauti
fied with evergreens. There will be a
speakers' stand with seats for the choral
societies reaching down before It. and the
remainder of the floor and galleries will
he fitted up to accommodate over BtKX)
people.
The choral children In front of the
speakers' stand will form one of the most
attractive features of the exercises.
There will be nearly four hundred of
them, and when seated they will form a
living flag. The red stripes will be formed
by rows of girls with brilliant crimson
capes, and the white with girls in white
capes: the field will be formed by rows
of boys With blue capes, and on the
it of each will shine a silver star.
The stand upon which the children will
be Mated will slope gently from the
speakers' stand to the floor and the ef
fect of the rows of color will be Been
from every seat In the building.
The children will take part in all the
songs, and will be assisted by the older
choral societies, which will sit Just above
The University students have re
considered their decision not to parade
rext Monday and accordingly the bat
talions will take part in the great jublloe
celebration. President Kellogg, Ptofes
sor Jones. Regent Penicke and a number
of senior students addressed the assem
who a pho^t while ago held up the
driver of a vegetable wagon on the San
Bruno road and robbed him. It is
claimed that at one of the places he
visited he was detected in the act of
robbing one of his victims, and was
ask*Â»i for an explanation. He imme-
I diately drew a revolver, and. pointing
it at his accuser, threatened to blow
his brains out. He then ordered him to
throw up his hands, after which he
took his purse, containing a few dimes.
Last ni^ht several Italian gardeners
visited police headquarters and enlisted
the servii^s of Chief Lees in finding
â¢ the desperado. They claim that the
Italian residents of the Mission live in
fear of the robber, and beg for protec
tion.
One of them claimed that the desper
ate man visited his garden a short time
M>Oi and. claiming that he was desti
tute, asked for a place to sleep.
He was taken in and allowed to sleep
with the other men employed about the
garden. When the men awoke on the
following morning they found their
clothes scattered about the floor and
the stranger gone. A subsequent ex
amination revealed that he had got up
during the night, searched their cloth
ing .and taken their money and val
uables.
The detectives who were looking for
him last night found several watches,
which he had stolen, in a pawnshop
on Montgomery avenue. In one of them
the proprietor said that he expected the
man to return, as he promised to call
again with some valuable silverware,
which he claimed was given him by a
friend. They waited until after mid
nierht and as the robber did not appear
they started out to find his room. It
was located on Stockton street and a
large quantity of stolen property was
found. They are hopeful of arresting
him to-day.

The British Ship Laoroone a Scene
of Trouble for Two Days.
For the past two days trouble, has been
brewing on the British ship Laomnne,

castle the 4th of this month, and last
evening the climax was reached when
Henry Snowdon and Adolph Heynlsch.
two of her crew, were locked up at the
Harbor Police station and charged with
being drunk. It is claimed that the two
men have been Indulging in Intoxicating
liquors for days past, and that the
trouble was partially caused by them,
but this the men deny, and state that
there are two men on board who are the
friends of the captain, and that they re
ceive more attention than should be
given to them by their captain, and that
the rest of the crew suffer almost for the
necessaries of life.
Early last evening the men started to
go aboard, but they were refused and
trouble commenced. The watchman was
told to keep, them off the vessel and car
ried out his instructions by blowing a
police whistle, with the above result. '
Lost Girl Found.
Josephine Kane, the pirl who disap

found last night by Detective Anthony.
She was living with a family at 833 Buah

her absence the pirl said that she had

The Health Department is preparing
some novel features for the parade,
but most of them will be sprung as a
surprise. There will be five floats tel
ling the story of the work of the health
officials and the need for Just such
measures as they have taken.
The first float will be the "Inspection
of Milk." On one side will be a grave
yard with a mother weeping over the
headstone of a little grave where her
child, killed by impure milk, lies bur
ied; on the other side will be pictured
the inspector stopping a wagon at a
horse trough where a milkman is try
ing to water his milk. The second float
will show a big canful of pure milk
and around it and drinking heartily
will be a number of children. The
third float will also be two sided, one
side showing the plumbing of a tene
ment before there were any such things
as plumbing regulations and the other
side will show a house with the plumb
ing according to the demands of the
Health Department. On the fourth
float will be a picture of a section of
Brooklyn alley in Chinatown before it
was remodeled by order of the depart
ment, and on the other side of the float
will be a scene from one of the dens of
Chinatown. The fifth float will show
a food Inspection station in operation,
with the officers examining the food
for the public institutions; on the other
side the same station will be shown,
with the doors locked and barred and
the sign "Closed for lack of appropria
tion" across it.
There will be other features of the
Health Department's division, which
will be equally startling.

INCAPACITATED
FROM DUTY
Policeman Wells, Sick
and Disabled, Asked
to Resign.
Chief Lees Determined to
Change the Beats of the
Various Sergeants.
Patrolman Peter Gillen's Case Con
tinued for Two
Weeks.
At the regular meeting of the Po
lice Commissioners last riight the case
of Officer William Wells charged with
being Incapacitated was taken up.
Wells had been on the force for many
years and is held in high regard by his
superior officers. Several months ago
he was taken ill and confined to his bed
for some time. Recently, however, he
has been doing duty at the Central sta
tion answering telephone calls. He fin
ally became bo ill that he was again
forced to ask for a leave of absence.
Learning from his attending physician
that he would never be able to do po
lice duty again. Captain Wittman de
cided to call his case to the attention
of the Police Commissioners.
When he was summoned before them
last night he feebly announced that he
did not think that he would ever get
well. He is suffering from Bright's
disease in a malignant form. It was
the intention of the Commissioners to
drop his name from the rolls, but after
listening to his story they allowed him
to resign. He promised to do so to
day.
Wells is one of the best known men
in the department and has a host of
friends. His sickness is regretted by
his fellow officers and as he left the
commissioners' rooms he had many
sympathizers. It is understood that a
strong effort will be made to-day to
have the commissioners not take for
mal action until he is eligible for re
tirement, which will be in a short time.
Police Officer Greenan was also be
fore the commissioners charged with
appearing for duty in a slovenly condi
tion. As it was his second offense he
was fined $20 and told that a similar
offense would lead to his being dis
missed from the force.
( >mcer Pete Gillen, charged with as
saulting a than whom he had under
arrest on New Tear's morning, had his
case continued for two weeks.

It Is known that Chief Lees is favora

Petitions for Worden.
If numbers count for anything in the
matter of petitions for executive clem
ency, Salter D. "Worden may count him
self comparatively safe. Ever since his
conviction the labor unions have been
striving by almost every known artifice
to save the neck of their brother-work
man, and since the United States Su
preme Court refused to interfere in the
matter have resorted to the last method
petitions to the Governor.
The first move was made by the two
central bodiesâ the Labor Council and
the Building Trades Council. Besides
formulating petitions themselves, they
instructed all subordinate unions to fol
low the same course, and these Instruc
tions have been followed out to the letter.
Each union which mot last week form
ulated its petition, which will be duly
forwarded under the seal of the union to
Governor Budd. Besides this, many of
the independent unions which are not
affiliated with either of the central bodle3
are taking the same course, and by Sat
urday night the Governor will have re
ceived in the neighborhood of fifty peti
tions from the trades unions alone.AFTER THE

seem to engage all the attention of
army officers stationed in and about

thing discussed quietly, but not pub
licly, which is of vastly more personal
Interest to the officers than is all the
outward display. Appointments to
succeed the present quartermaster and
commissary generals of the army con
stitute the engrossing themes of con
versation in army circles. Quarter-
master-General Weeks retires this
month, and several aspirants for pro
motion are actively rallying all the
political influence available to bear on
the selection of Weeks' successor.
Telegrams from Washington and
comments in Eastern military publi
cations insist that Colonel Ludington
will get the chief place in the depart
ment. Colonel Lee, who was formerly
depot quartermaster in this city, is in
Washington making an active fight for
the place. Colonel Moore, now serv
ing as the chief quartermaster in this
department, has many friends who
would be delighted to hear of his pro
motion to the first place in the corps.
Old army politicians say that Colonel
Ludington may yet be turned down.
Should Lee be appointed, Moore and
Ludington could come in later and hold
the office after his retirement, but if
Ludington should win Moore and Lee
would be/shut out, as they would reach
the age of retirement before Luding

The plan for lighting the Presidio res
ion and the barracks of enlisted
m^n, as well as the quarters of offi
cers, with electricity has been aban
doned or at least shelved for the pres
<nt. The figures which the Edison
Light and Power Company gave were
too high for the consideration of the
army authorities* The fact is dis
closed that the plans for the recently
constructed double brick barracks, al
though supposed to be modern in many
respects, made no provision whatever
for wirinET the barracks. The authori
ties In Washington, perhaps, fancied
that electric lights were unknown to
Ban Francisco.
The proposed parade next Monday in
honor of the opening.of the Golden Ju
bilee is engaging the attention of every
one at the Presidio garrison. The col
umn will embrace the largest number
of United States troops ever paraded at
one time in San Francisco. There will
be In line eight companies of the First
United States Infantry. Colonel Evan
Miles commanding. Eight batteries of
the Third Artillery, Colonel M. P. Mil
ler, will probably parade. A squadron
of four troops of the Fourth Cavalry
will join the column.
Officers and enlisted men of the regu
lar, army are confident of their ability
to make a display highly creditable to
the service, but they fear that the civic
arrangements will be inadequate, and
imperfect as usual, and that the troops
will be crowded out of line to make
room on the streets for spectators.
Co-lorel Mllps said yesterday: "The
First United States Infantry will make
a fine display if we can pet room to pa
rade company front on Market street.
Tl'Jt I am afraid we will be crowded
out of alignment by the spectators if
we attempt to march in that order. If
pome regulations could be adopted to
give us the entire width of the street
between sidewalks the regiment would
mike a superb showing."

The Sad -Fate' of Dr. Schenk of Vienna, Who Discovered the Secret c
of Sex. *
Tlnje, midnight. Place, Dr. Schenk/s bedroon). DrarQatls personac, Dr. ScheoK aod three spirits of those who
rt)!ght have been girls. c
Dr. S. (stiffly) â Science is not cruel; science is merely truthful. (
Spirit of the Red-haired Girl â Science is stupid and meddlesome. It has no poetry: no romance. It was t
made for old dried up, thick-headed Germans like you; not for girls like we â misht have been. I
Spirit of the Brunette â Why, I might have been the greatest soprano the world has ever known! (
Spirit of the Red-haired Girl â And I might have been a second George Eliot. <
Spirit of the Blonde â And I might have been beautifulâ lovely as Eve, as Helen, who knows; who can tell? I
The Doctor (softened) â It Is a pity, my dear. I confess I never thought of you. And yet. science is uncom- I
promising in its disregard for the individual. It works only for the betterment <>f the race. t
Spirit of the Brunette â We've as much right to be born as you have. (
Spirit of the Red-haired Girlâ Yes. How would you have liked it if some cold-blooded German professor I
had made this discovery of yours before your time? If your mother had been cheated "Ut of her birthright, (
where would you have been? <
The Doctor gazes thoughtfully into space. He does not answer. Â»
Spirit of the Red-haired Girlâ The thing that rankles is the insult of it all. T" be told that you're persona I
non grata before you've so much ar. asked for admittance. I
Hpirit of the Brunette â O. the old world is getting- too exclusive for anything: I
Spirit of the Blonde (wistfully > â How could you have been so cruel? I
The Doctor (uncomfortably) â Now, don't. Please don't. I appeal to you. You know how much in demand i
boy babies are, and you'll admit that one of the first principles of business economy is that the demand ere- i
ates a supply. If you'll only be good enough to consider me as merely an instrument. If I hadn't done this i
somebody else would. (
Spirit of the Brunetteâ lt's a coward's argument. â¢ i
Spirit of the Red-haired Girl (threateningly)â The time will come, sir, when you'll regret it. That's all. i
Dr. S. (coldly) â I fail to see how that can be. i
Spirit of the Red-haired Girl â O, you do! Well, let me tell you, learned professor, that a girl, and an lin- i
born girl at that, can teach you something. You evidently don't know my sex as well as I do. Our earthly
sisters will avenge our wrongs. Trust to them! The greater the success this barbarous discovery of yours has,
the fewer women will there be on earth. And, as a natural consequence â I don't know anything about busi
ness economy, but I, know women pretty well â they'll make you men suffer. If woman hitherto has been called
capricious, fickle, unreasonable, tyrannical, what adjectives will you need to describe her in the time to
come? You are building up a feminine monopoly. Woe, woe unto the world of man when woman, becoming
scarcer, and therefore more precious, realises the full extent of tlv power which you. Doctor Fchenk, have
placed in her hands!
The Doctor (pettishly)â l wish you'd go away and let me sleep.
The Spirit of the Brunetteâ Never.
Spirit of the Blonde (sobbing)â l h-hope s-something '11 h-happen to the women left on earth, and you
s-stingy, mean old men '11 have the whole p-place to yourselves. There!
Spirit of the Brunette (indignantly) â I suppose you're satisfied now. You've made her cry. Never mind,,
dearie, it's only what we women ought to have expected from such brutes. It's the climax to all wove suffered
at their hands since Adam first lied about Eve. Perhaps, after all, it's as well that we shouldn't enter such
a world. And really it may be an art of far-sighted mercy on the part of the Chinese to strangle and drown
their girl babies. Who wouldn't prefer being strangled to enduring the lot of a Chinese woman!
The Doctor (hopefully)â Now, that's real philosophy. Why don't you apply the same reasoning to me?
It may be that you've cause to be grateful to me for sparing you much suffering.
The three, togetherâ O. indeed! So kind of you!
The Doctor (yawning disgustedly)â Well, anyway, what's the use of discussing it? At this time of night,
too. Call during the day. My office hours are from 2t04 in the afternoon. Come then, do, like good, re
spectable spirits.
Spirit of the Red-haired Girl (sarcastically) â O, of course you'll attack our character. It's only what we
expect.
The Doctor (earnestly)â l assure you, madam
Spirit of the Red-haired Girl (furiously) â Madam, indeed! And pray, how could I. how can I ever become
madam if you're to be an earthly Saint Peter, and shut the gates in every woman's face?
The Doctor (groaning) â O, do go away! How can the thing be helped DOW? Why didn't you protest be
fore? What can I do now?
The Threeâ What?
Why. say that it's all a Joke.
Pay that you've made a mistake
Say that you've lost the formula.
The Doctor (firmly)â Never!
Spirit of the Brunetteâ Well, that?
our answer to you, too. We'll hanni
i you. We'll make your life miser
i able. You shall not sleep. You
shall not rest. You've murdered
myriads of innocent souls. You're
the blackest villain that ever
breathed. Macbeth was a saint
compared to you; he, at least, i â  r
mitted people to be born. You de
prive us of life before we know
what life is. Woe, woe, woe to you,
O Dr. Schenk. Unborn woman shall
be the death of you. The doctors
will call it nervous prostration, but
i we and you will know what really
i caused it. Beware! Beware! Be
ware!

L. A. Giacobbi, a Kcarny-Street
Jeweler, Arrested for Receiv
ing Stoler) Property.
L,. A. Giacobbt, a Jeweler at 330 JOarny
street, was arrested yesterday afternoon
by Detectives Harry Reynolds and Dinan
on a warant charging him with receiving
stolen goods.
The fashionable boarding-house of Mrs.
G. H. Coy, 439 Geary street, was f. :
by a burglar on September ti la?t and
eight diamonds were Stolen. There VU
considerable mystery about the burglary
at the time, as no one was seen to
or leave the place, the diamonds having
been stolen during the afternoon.
Reynolds and Dlnan ascertained from
John Cullum, who is serving a term for
grand larceny, that c stole the diamonds
and sold them to Giaeobbi for $60 on Sep
tember 20. The aiamonds were worth
$250 acording to the estimate put upon
them by Mrs. Coy.
An application was made to Giacobbi
for th* diamonds, and the detectives say
that he promised to return them after the
holidays, as he had sold the two largest
and would require time to ge\ lli> m. He
has not vet delivered tham. and yesterday
it was determined to arrest him for re
ceiving stolen goods.

There was an exciting scene in Judge
Low's court yesterday afternoon for a
few minutes. Mrs. Croner was undt r
cross-examination by ex-Jndgc Murphy
in the case of Mrs. Louise Kersten. with
whom Mrs. Croner's husband eloped from
Germany, and was being asked how
many children she had, when she gave
a loud scream and went into a violent
attack of hysterics. It lasted for a few
minutes, but she gradually became calm

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALi,, THURSDAY, JANUARY 20, IS9B.
WILL APPEAL
TO THE COURTS
Merchants in Open Re
volt Against Further
Taxation.
Determined to Fight the Pro
posed Licensing of Ex
cavations.
They Declare Itto Be Illegal, Inasmuch
as Sidewalks Are a Part of
the Premises.
Probably the Board of Supervisors
never conjured up a more unpopular
measure than the proposed ordinance
to tax business men for the use of
space underneath the sidewalks. With
out a single exception the merchants
have lifted their voices in protest
against the measure and declare it an
outrage they will not submit to. They
bring many arguments to show why
this tax should not be imposed upon
them, not the least of their contentions
being that they now have to pay a tax
on their goods and a license to do busi
ness, in addition to their rent, and any
further burden would be rank injus
tice.
It is argued that the space under
neath the sidewalks is of no use what
ever to the city, while its utilization by
the business men tends to keep the
sidewalks clear of goods.
Moreover, It is asserted that the
courts have decided that the sidewalks
are a part of the premises and such a
EL S. (sitting up in bed. the clothes I
tightly drawn about him)â l must <
say, young ladks, that this is most (
inconsiderate of you. What do you (
mean by disturbing a man so sorely (
in need of sleep as I am? <
Spirit of a Brunetteâ And what do <
you mean by boycottingâ l should (
say girlcottingâ us? {
Dr. S. â My dear young woman (
Spirit of a Brunette â I'm not your <
dear young woman, nor likely to be <
anybody's dear young woman, (
thanks to meddlesome you! Why (
couldn't you mind your own affairs? (
I'm sure no one wanted to be your <
daughter <
Spirits of a Blonde and Red-haired <
Girl togetherâ lndeed not! {
Spirit of the Brunette â Then why <
couldn't you let other people alone? (
Dr. S. (pettishly)â You're as un- <
reasonable as you'd be if you had t
bodies and were women! (
Spirit Ol the Red-haired Girlâ And (
you're as exuel as you'd be if you I
had no soul and were a demon! (
I tax, or license, would be illegal It is
certain that the city dcvs not construct
or repair sidewalks, that expense fall
ing upon the property-owners, so why,
say the people most interested, should
the municipality set up a claim to Ju
risdiction in the matter of fixing the
I space underneath the walks.
The point is made that the property
owner pays the cost of excavating the
space referred to and walls it up and
covers it over in such a manner that it
is an actual benefit to the city, for
wh"n the sidewalk is laid it rc-sts on
a solid foundation, whereas if it were
put down on the sand it would soon
fettle in places, causing numerous
1 >reaks and a r<.-ugh and uneven Bur
face It is much more expÂ»nsiv.\ say
the property-owners, to put down a
sidewalk ov<r an excavation than it
would be on the ground, to say nothing
of the cost of excavation and walling up
of the outer Fide, and the rent derived
from this extra space barely pays in
terest o-n the extra cost.
Some of the merchants say the ordi
nance bord'-rs on the ridioulo-us and
! that the Supervisors will not attempt to
pass it, while one and all declare they
will fight it to the bitter end if the at
tempt is made to enact it into a mu
nicipal law. If it is passed, they de
clare they will attack its constitut.ion
' ality in the courts, but they consider it
a hardship to be compelled to seek re
dress from what they term so- oppres
sive a measure in the courts.

Fighting the "Monkey
Park Job."
Movement Organizing to Un
mask the Plot to Rob
the City.
OPINION TO BE AROUSED.
Â«
An Influential Committee Will Point
Out the Path of Duty to the
Supervisors.
The better class of citizens in the
Mission district is thoroughly aroused
to a lealization of the kind of colored
biped that lurks in the woodpile of the
zoological experts and enthusiasts cm
the Board of Supervisors, and purpose
making a public exhibition of the freak.
At an important meeting held by lead-
Ing property-owners and influential
residents of the Mission yesterday
afternoon it was decided to provide for
the public ratification, at an early day,
of the position Supervisor Clinton has
taken against the conspiracy to dump
on the already overburdened taxpay
ers of San Francisco what has come
to be described as "the monkey-park
Job." Under cover of the resolutions to
be presented an exposure is to be made
of the plot to rob the city In the inter
est of a clique. Besides, the subject of
improvements actually needed in the
district will come up for thorough dis
cusston and review.
Primarily it was the Intention to hold
this mass-meeting Saturday night, but
the organization committee was unable
to procure a suitable hall. Monday
and Tuesday nights were objected to on
the ground that public interest and
excitement would be centered in the di
version* <>f the Jubilee week, while a
similar objection obtained against nam
ing the following Saturday evening, as
It Is on that day the mining exhibition
opens. All things considered, it was j
deemed wisest to name some early day
in the succeeding week for the first de
monstration and to follot* this meet
ing promptly with a second and third.
In widely separate sections of the dis
drict, so that knowledge of the pro
posed fraud may be brought to the at
tention of all classes.
The gentlemen having the matter In
hand are acting in perfect accord, and
affirm they will fight the manipulators
of the deal to a finish.
â When this proposition for a Mis
sion park and zoo was originally can
vassed," said one of the committee yes
terday, "many of us favored it, and a
large number of good citizens signed
the petition, without having given the
subject proper inquiry. As to the
real motive at the bottom of the scheme
â the design to rob the city out of
many thousands of dollars under the
pretext of having the Supervisors un
dertake a public improvement â we were
kept in the dark. In short, we w=-rt>
cunningly and plausibly deceived. The
moment we learned that the proposal
concealed a monstrous and daring
piece of jobbery we opposed it. Dr.
Clinton was deceived like the rest of
us. He speaks our sentiments and
has the courage to represent officially
not only our disapproval of the hum
bug, but our determination to unmask
it, even if we have to go into the courts.
This we do not think will be necessary.
We know the Mission people will not
Indorse such a transparent steal, and
we are certain the Supervisors will not
dare to act in defiance of the public
opinion certain to be expressed to them
In no uncertain manner before we get
through with showing up the jobbery."
It is a claim to be urged by the com
mittee that little more than half the
i amount of money proposed to be
; squandered on the purchase of the so
; called "monkey-house tract" would be
1 sufficient to equip the city with a first
! class hospital and pesthouse, to take
I the place of the inhuman and disgrace
! ful institutions at present described by
those names.
â¢ They insist that the system of dis
tributive confinement for criminals is
especially pernicious, and that the
worst and most expensive feature of it
is what they sarcastically denominate
the "health resort," maintained for
vagabonds and petty offenders in the
House of Correction. They hold that
this building, as well as the industrial
home, should be vacated, and the in
mates transferred to- the City Prison.
If the people desire an institute for the
propagation of monkeys and parrots,
the House of Correction building, at a
comparatively trifling outlay, they
maintain, could be utilized for such
purpose, while at the same time econ
omy and greater efficiency of control
would be assumed by the removal
thence of a class of willful criminals
who are at present pampered.
The hundred-acre tract occupied by
these structures and owned by the city
is not more than a thousand yards dis
tant from the "Gum-tree Tract." and is
better adapted for a park. Moreover,
it would cost no mare than might be re
quired for improvements, while in the
case of the Mission Park and Zoo
scheme It is proposed to make the tax
payers disgorge the handsome sum of
$387,000 for a plot of ground cm which
the appraisement is approximately
$55,000.
These subjects, as well as the necessi
ty of reconstructing the Mission schools
and extending the street improvements,
will be discussed thoroughly by prop
erty-owners and citizens having the
best interests of the Mission at heart,
when the promised. meetings are held.

V If L PRESCOTT 4 CO., NEW YORK. W%
the proposition. As for the new City and
County Hospital, its contemplated erec
tion Is nothing new to my mind. A refer
ence to the resolutions on file in the
clerk's office of the Board of Supervisors
will show that as early as last May I
offered a resolution almost similar to the
one offered by Dr. Rottanzi at the last
meeting of the board. Hence there can
be no doubt as to how I stand on that
question. The present hospital should be
burned down; it Is a disgrace to the city
and the people that live in the city. I
am in favor of the erection of a first
class hospital on the Almshouse tract
for two reasons. First, the elevated
position would give drainage, fresh air
and sunshine to the invalids, and second.
It would be within close proximity to the
Affiliated Colleges, where it would be
very valuable for clinical purposes.
When this hospital is built and a proper
pesthouse erected, then if the taxpayers
show me that they still need a monkey
ranch, my word for it, I shall not offer
any obstacles in their way. My reason
for voting for the survey was because
Dr. Clinton proclaimed there was a Job
in it. I wanted to see where the job was,
otherwise I would have opposed making
a survey at this time.
SUPERVISOR ROTTANZI-There Is
an absolute necessity fur a new hospital.
Public opinion shows this beyond any
peradventure. The present building
which is called a hospital is an ever
lasting disgrace to the city, and until
this building is removedâ excuse ni. . I
mean burned downâ after we have built
a new one. as I consider that is the one
way to effectually destroy the germs of
disease that are lodged in that dirty old
wooden buildingâ then, I say, we should
turn these fifteen acres into a park for
the Mission people, and if need be locate
a zoo there on a small scale at first.
Then if it should become popular to have
a larger collection of wild animals, why
we can easily have another in some other
portion of the city.
But the new hospital must come first,
and we must have a hospital that will
be built and conducted on the most mod
ern principles known to science. I will
watch the erection of that building as if
it were my own private property and do
everything that lies in my power to make
it a credit to not only San Francisco, but
the entire State.
SUPERVISOR HASKTXS-Glve us a
hospital and pesthouse first, then it will
be time enough to talk about a park and
the providing of a lot of animals to make
up a zoological collection. The Super
visors are the representatives of the peo
ple, and it is no more than right and
proper that when a petition is addressed
to thorn as a body requesting something
in their gilt by virtue of their position
that it should get a respectful hearing
I have my doubts whether the survey
would have been ordered at the last
meeting of the board had it not been
for Dr. Clintons attack on the job phase
of it. Bear in mind that it was Dr. Clin
ton himself that introduced the original
resolution for the purchase of the tract
Once more I say hospital first, pesthouse
second, and th^n if the people want an
additional tract of land for a park they
can have it, but it must be by a con
demnation suit, so that Dr. Clinton can
not say "job"â "job."
SUPERVISOR DODGEâ I think that
the number and character of the citizens
who have for months interested them
selves in this movement entitles the pro
ject to at least a respectful consideration
by the representatives of the people. If
the press reflects the opinions of the pub
lic or if its opinions are of any value in
matters of public concern, we have an
additional reason for at least a consider
ation of the project, as with one excep
tion I believe it is unanimous in its sup
port of the project. I do not believe there
is any desire on the part of the Board
of Supervisors to foist this property on
the city, unless a majority of the citizens
are in favor of its purchase. Now, I be
lieve that the project could not survive
If any taint of a job should attach to it.
Two reasons have been urged against it,
one being that the owners of the property
asked more than the land was worth, and
th;it. therefore, it was a job and a steal.
I believe It is recognized that there are
such things as an asking price and a
selling price, and these owners might
bad some such knowledge. It hap
pens, however, that those in favor of this
purchase at once asked that the. land,
if purchased, be bought through condem
nation proceedings. This presumably would
remove this objection. The second rea
son urged, that the city owns a tract
adjoining, is offset by the fact that the
property cannot be utilized for this pur
pose of the city, and Is. further, not a
desirable tract for such an object. In a
genera] way the acquisition of such a
tract of land by the city at a fair valua
tion might be generally admitted to be
advisable. It becomes a question, how
ever, as to whether the city can spare
the money for its purchase at this time.
There certainly are more pressing needs,
such as a city and county hospital, better
public schools, etc. Unless our citizens
P willing to abandon our time-honored
ty pledgeâ the dollar limitâ l fail to see

erer, a hospital man right through and
through, and nothing shall change me
from the advocacy of the building of a
iirst-class modern city and county hos
pital, with a pesthouse thrown in. These
two buildings the people need and must
have.
Supervisor Sheehan's opinions on this
subject have already appeared in the
columns of The Call on a previous oc
casion. They were in harmony with
the views of the Supervisors more re

THE ACTION
HAD NO MERIT
H. W. Philbrook's Case ftoasted
and Then Thrown Out
of Court.
No Proof of Conspiracy or That His
Constitutional Riyhts Had
Been Invaded.
Horace "W. Philbrook, attorney and
counselor at law, lost half a million dol
lars yesterday.
This statement. Is not sufficiently pre
cise standing alone. The fact is that his
suit against the Justices of the Supreme
Court and others for half a million dam
ages because they had disbarred him for
contempt was dismissed by Judge Hiram
Knowles of Montana, sitting in the place
of United States Circuit Judge Morrow.
Early in the proceedings, after Mr.
Phllbrook had stated his case to the
jury, a motion was made to dismiss the
action so far as Attorney-General Fitz
gerald and Robert Y. Hayne were con
corned. Mr. Philbrook made an elabor
ate argument on the motion and Judge
I Carpenter replied.
Yesterday afternoon Judge Knowles
rendered an opinion granting the motion
to dismiss as against the two defendants
i named. The opinion held that Philbrook
j had not proved his allegation of consplr
< acy: that he had been disbarred by prop
' er process of law and for just cause; that
! the language complained of in the Phil
' brook brief if presented to any court in
the land. would be construed as insulting
and derogatory to the dignity of the
court; that the Justices of the Supreme
Court could not be held liable in a civil
action for any acts done in their judicial
capacity, even if they had expressed their
'â  authority; that no constitutional right of
Philbrook had been violated, and that
! there was no evidence to prove any con
j splracy at all on the part of any of the
defendants.
Motions followed by the attorneys for
> the other defendants to dismis9 as aguinat
! them, and the motions were granted. Mr.
j Philbrook interposed an exception in each
case.
After the adjournment of court he an
nounced that he intended to take an apÂ«

Friday and had not returned home since.
Her brother, Jim Castelo, made a com
plaint and the detectives watched for
Delia. She was charged with vagrancy
at the Californta-strfet station.
She stated that she and her brother
had quarreled over trifling matters, but
that she had determined never to go
home again as she was 27 years of age
and capable of taking care of herself.
She told of being engaged to a young
man by the name of Jim Hallahan, who
resides at 19 Silver avenue, and said that
they were to have been married to-day
as Hallahan had declared his intention
of taking out a marriage license. The
couple, according to her statement, were
to have been married on the day before
Christmas but something prevented. The
officers are of the opinion that the girl
is simple-minded, and she bears out the
idea to a certain extent, as sho Bays she
has been under a doctor's care for over
a year and that the treatment given her
had slightly affected her hearing and
mind.
She cried almost continuously during"
the first few hours following her arrest,
but was not willing that her brother
should be notified of her condition. The
story told by her la nut given much
credence by the police.

Invest in pools in this city and county or
elsewhere. To both of them the attorney
replied that in his opinion it would.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 19.â The market for stocks
to-day Improved in tone and activity as the
day wore on. and at the close the general list
showed fractional Improvements, while In some
cases there was a rise of from 1 to 2Â»4 points.
The close was strong at the beat prices of the
day. The extreme ease of money, call loans
being made as low as 1%. was a potential In
fluence in the market's late strength. There
were several other beneficial features In the
news' of the day, the weekly earnings of rail
ways in nearly every case were net increases,
running up to $20,000 in Chesapeake and Ohio
and $30,000 in Louisville and Nashville. The
$15,000,000 Illinois Central Terminal bonds were
considerably over-subscribed. These facts, to
gether with the action of the House of Repre
sentatives at Washington In sustaining points
cf order against Cuban resolutions, caused a
rising tide in quotations, the traders taking
the view that legislative action In behalf of
Cuba for a while, at' least, was Improbable
Washington reports regarding the currency
question had little Influence on the London
market for Americans, and Berlin and Frank
fort were reported as taking a pathetic view
of the subject. The transactions In Northern
Pad Ho were in considerable volume. Sugar
rose on street rOMip that it was time for a
resumption of the bull campaign in that spe
cialty. Northern Pacific left off at 1* advance
on hopeful expressions regarding the earnings
by friends of the property.
The bond market maintained a fair degree of,
strength, with transactions largely centered in
the speculative lines. The aggregate Kales were
450, 000. Government bonds showed an easier
tendency.
The sales of stocks to-day were 287,600 shares,
including: C. & O , 3215: Baltimore and Ohio,

LONDON KARKKTS.
NEW YORK, Jan. 39.â The Evening Post's
liondon financial cablegram says: The etock
market here to-day was quiet and Irregular
to dull. Grand Trunks and Americans had
the best market*, although the latter were
unfavorably affected at the opening by news
that the United State* Senate Finance Com
mittee had reported favorably Senator Tel
ler's hi!! for paying the bonds In silver. The
Continent bought Americans, and German buy-
Ing of Northern Pacific was a feature.
New York exchange is closely watched and
especially in view of the ease of money here.
There was a general reaction In Argentines.
The references In these dispatches yesterday
to the financial position In Austria was based
on economic conditions.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO. Jan. 19.â Wheat started with some
show of weakness. As usual, the opening was
greatly Influenced by Liverpool, and the action
of that market on this occasion was a disap
pointment to the bulls. Liverpool opened '413)
%d higher, but by opening time here that ad
vance had nearly all been lost. The market,
however, was only slightly affected, and after
a few minutes hesitation a firm undertone was
shown. May, which closed yesterday at SIS'??
91V. opened to-day at 91VÂ«c. sold at 91% c and
for some time stood at about 91U@31%c. About
11 o'clock the market became strong and ad
vanced to 91V4C. The July option was the fea
ture of the trade, however. It opened at S1T&0
S2c, or %c under yesterday's price, but started
up at once, and by the time May had reached
91% c July had advanced to 83c. A great dÂ»*al
of the early buying of July was credited to the
Letter people, which had the effect of not only
driving local shorts to cover, but outside shorts
as well, as for a time the trading In that
option was decidedly warm.
The advance that followed the opening de
cline was In the face of a good deal of bearish
Information brought in over the wires. Besides
the early loss at Liverpool, Flour at Paris was
reported 20 centimes lower for March-June
term: English country markets were from 6d to
Is lower, and a well-known Paris, grain dealer
cabled that French duties were Immovable,
that crop prospects for next harvest was mas
nificent and that the requirements of foreign
Wheat in that country from now to July 1
were only about 14,000.000 bushels. Afterward
the clcsinc cables from Parts quoted both
Wheat and Flour from M to 15 centimes higher,
and from Antwerp a rifÂ» of 12M centimes was
advised. Liverpool closed >*d higher for the
day for March Wheat and V t <i lower for May.
Clearances from Atlantic and" Gulf ports were
equal In Wheat and Flour to SK.MQ bushels.
Local receipts were 17 cars, against 20 the
similar day of the year before.
Realizing by local longs became quite free
in the afternoon. In both the May and July
options, and slight declines ensued. The ex
treme dullness which set in .during the last
half hour also had Its influence, and the mar
ket was weak at the close. May at 9114 c and
July at 92% c.
There was some improvement in the trade In
Corn. The market was weak on general sell
ing by room traders. May ranged from 29c to
28H@2S%c. and closed a shade higher at 28vÂ»c.
Market for Oats was dull, as In the other
grain pits. The start* was easy, but the ad
vance in Wheat and Corn was followed by
Oats.
Considerable Interest was shown In Provis
ions and prices advanced. Later the market
became weak and nearly all the advance was
[oat. At the clobp May park Â«a:; H4c higher at
*3 59, May lard IHe lower at $4 724 and May

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Jan. 19.â The American Wool and
. Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the
wool market: A more featureless week In thÂ»
wool market has not been witnessed In a very :
, long time. Last year at this time the market
was very active. The difference in the situa
tion Is shown In the fact that a week ago
the sales of wool since January 1, IS9S. were
10.958.000 pounds, against 7.165.600 pounds In
1 IS9J, whereas the sales to the present time are ;
14.335,000 pounds, against 13,633,700 pounds last |
, year.
As a matter of fact the present volume of
business would a few years ago have been con
sidered very satisfactory. The enormous tran
1 sactions which characterized the tariff year
! have made the earlier period seem quite re
mote. Pome persons, however, are now
1 awakening to the fact that the market is at
i present In about what may be truthfully called
a normal condition.
A feeling of confidence exists on all sides
and the demand for wool has been of a gen-
I eral character the past week. Prices are firmly
maintained and It would be difficult to point
i out a locality where concessions would be
likely to be made.
LONDON WOOL BALEB.
LONDON, Jan. 19.â The wool auction sales
were continued to-day with a good attend
i ance of buyers. The American buyers also

CHICAGO, Jan. 19.â The Industrial World

' the latter being exhausted. Iron bars are In

OF A LOVER
A Rejected Jap Suitor
Tries to Kill a
Widow.
Shinjiro Then Ends His Misery
by Shooting Into His
Brain.
Miraculous Escape of a Baby Girl
Who Wue Asleep on the
Bed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
50$ Broadway, Jan. 19.
Had Shinjiro Matsumoto followed
the pretty custom of his race and
placed a bunch of flowers outside the
door of his lover and been guided by
their acceptance or rejection a tragedy
that occurred this morning would
have been avoided. Instead of press-
Ing his suit In genuine Japanese fash
ion Shinjiro made a formal demand
for the hand of a young widow, and
because It was not complied with Mrs.
Tama Yuwasku Is at the Receiving
Hospital suffering from three bullet
rounds and her impetuous lover Is at
the Morgue.
In the Japanese quarter at Fifth arid
Castro streets shooting was heard
about 7 o'clock this morning. The re
ports were followed by a woman's
screams and several of the boarders in
the house at once went to the apart
ments whence came the noise.
On the floor of the room was the
dead body of Shinjiro and on the bed,
unconscious and bleeding, was the
young widow. Alongside of her. still
asleep, was her little girl, and a glance
at the direction in which the bullets
from the murderer's pistol flew showed
plainly that It was only by a miracle
that none of them lodged in the child's
brain. The woman was at once taken
to the hospital, and the doctors found
that two shots had entered her jaw
and one had gone clean through her
shoulders, though neither of them is
necessarily fatal. After shooting the
woman the man turned the gun on
himself, and his life went out with the
first shot.
Mrs. Yuwasku tells the following
story: "I am a widow, my husband
having died about five months ago,
leaving me with this little girl. I met
Matsumoto In Sacramento and came
down to Oakland looking 1 for work
last Monday. To my surprise Matsu
moto was also boarding in the house.
He at once implored me to marry him,
but I declined. Yesterday we went for
a walk, and he repeated his desire to
marry me. He seemed almost beside
himself when I told him I did not care
for him. This morning before he fin
ished dressing he came to my room
and implored me to love him. and I
told him it was impossible, to which he
replied that 1 was fooling with him.
This is not so, for I never gave him to
understand that I had any affection at
all for him. Without another word he
produced a pistol and shot at me three
times, after which he killed himself. I
cannot understand how the baby did
rot get killed."
The landlord of the boarding house
says the woman has been looking for
â¢work and is a respectable person. An
Inquest on Matsumoto will be held to
morrow night.

long veil fell into the folds of the train,
completely enveloping the slender, stylish
figure, and was fastened to the coiffure
with a magnificent diamond crescent, the
gift of the groom. The bridal bouquet
was of lilies of the valley.
The bride was attended by Miss Jean
ette Conroy, who acted us maid of honor,

A
LUCKY DOG
INDEED.
last Tuesday
* night was H. J.
Abrahms, a prominent business man of
Omaha, who, with his wife and mother,
was on his way to visit relatives in this
city.
The family were bringing out with
them a valuable hunting do?, that was
taken care of en route in the baggage
car. When the accident occurred the
family left the sleeper as soon as possi
ble and hurried to the front part of the
train, which was merely a mass of splin
tered and twisted debris, the baggage-car
in particular being: nothing more than a
heap of broken lumber and scrap iron.
Mrs. Abrahms, who was in advance of
the rest, had gone forward, carrying a
few samples of medicines she happened
to have with her. In the hope of being
able to do something for some of the suf
ferers. When she arrived on the scene
she found the place patrolled by armed
guards to prevent any possible attempt
at robbery, and on inquiry learned that
everything possible had already been
done for the unfortunate victims.
She accordingly turned to go back to her i
sleeper, when something moving amid thÂ« !
wreckage attracted her attention. Ap
proachlng closer she saw the family dog,
still chained to a twisted post, calmly
viewing the surrounding chaos with the j
same unconcern that will one day char
acterize Macaulay's New Zealander when I
he sits on that broken arch of London j
bridge and contemplates the surround- j
ing desolation.
The dog was the only living thing in
the baggage-car that was not seriously
Injured.

HIS SIN
FOUND HIM
OUT.
i sons does not wish to be quoted by name.
This gentleman is fond of all sorts of
j amusements, but the pastime that Is
particularly pleasing to him is the one
in which a full hand is reported to beat
three of a kind, and to the perfecting of
his knowledge of the various Intricacies
of this game he has heretofore been
' wont to devote most of his spare time
j and incidentally some of his spare
; change, meeting the objections of his
| wife with the argument that there could
! hardly be anything wrong in what he
1 was doing, as the leading men of the na
1 tion were sent to Washington by their
admirers and paid 55000 a year to do ex
! actly the same thing. His wife, who is
a patient little woman, rested satisfied
I with this explanation, contenting herself
I with sending the bellboy to round up her
: recalcitrant spouse whenever the hour
! became too late. A few days ago the
wife's parents, who are prominently con
; nected with church work in the East
I and imagine that their son-in-law is the
very incarnation of virtue, came out on
a visit. During the first evening that the
; old people spent with their children the
gon-ln-law rang for icewater. He waited
and waited, but no boy came to answer
the call. Finally, after the button had
] been pressed a number of times, the door
| was suddenly opened and the company
were electrified to hear the following:
j "Oh. Mrs. X, I think your husband must
!bo running up against some outside
1 game. I have hunted for him in every
; saloon and cluoroom for two blocks
! around, but can't find him." That paiv
i ticular bellboy will get no tip this month.

an Inquiry held at the residence of her
brother-in-Jaw, Henry Evers, on San
Pablo avenue.
Miss Suckert is 39 years of age and
has been residing for some time with
her sister. About a year ago she be
came deeply Interested In the Advent
. Ist religion, and since that time has
'] been a very close Bible student.
Gradually she became subject to mel
ancholia and finally religion took such
| a hold on her that ehe Imagined she
j was beinp persecuted by members of
'other beliefs. Medical aid was pro-
I cured, but her condition gradually be
! came won
Last Thursday she showed signs of
violent insanity, and was watched con
tinually by a member of the family.
Friday she believed Phe was being
chased by spirits and Saturday last she
cut her wrist with a razor and also at
tempted to use the weapon on one of
her nephews. Since that time she has
been continually poring over her Bible
and has been very despondent. This
morning: Mr. Evers swore to a com
plaint charging Miss Suckert with in
sanity. Her physicians decided that
she could not be taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, so Judge Hall and the
doctors examined her at the house, and
recommenced her commitment. She
will be taken to Agnews in a few
days. ____________
WORKMEN WANT
THEIR WAGES
Employes of Jory Bros., Shoe
Manufacturers, Are
Clamoring.
Eighty or Them ArÂ« Minus Payâ The
Whereabouts of the Jorys
Unknown.
There Is weeping and wailing among the
employes of the Jory Bros.' Manufactur
ing Co., makers of boots and shoes, 63 to
73 Stevenson street.
The mental anguish In this case Is In
direct consequence of the closing of that
concern last Monday, with two weeks'
pay due to about eighty employes.
"W*. J. Jory Is manager and E. J. Jory
secretary of the suspended concern. Tho
workmen have been clamoring for their
due and hunting high and low for the
brothers Jory for the past forty-eight
hours, but they have not succeeded In
finding their late employers, nor have
they yet discovered any plan by which
they can get the $600 or so which la said to
be their right, nor any fraction thereof.
It had been agreed upon by the em
ployes to levy an attachment yesterday
to secure their claims, but they were dis
euaded from that course when an Investi
gation disclosed the fact that there was
nothing to attach. It Is stated that the
Jorys. prior to their disappearance, had
collected all the money due the concern,
and that there was no property In the
factory subject to attachment.
The plant used by this concern Is owned
by the Nolan Bros. Bhoe Company, whlrh
leased It to the Jory company about two
years ago. The manufacturing company
perms to have done a fair business of
late, and the employes were not anticipat
ing any such trouble as has come upon
them.
Both of the Jory brothers have resided
for some time past at 35 1S Twenty-third
street. A visitor there last night found
It deserted and learned from neighbors
.of the Jorys that the latter had moved
away the day before â whence no one
could say.
Jt was rumored yesterday morning that
the Jorys had sailed for the Klondike on
the steamer Excelsior last Thursday, but
the report was denk-d later on. At all
events. It Is certain that the employes of
thlp factory have no Idea where to find
their late "employers nor where to look
for the wages due them.

MARRIED THE BISHOP'S NEPHEW,
Elaborate and Impressive Ceremony at the Rus-
sian Orthodox Chucrh.
Peter Popoff, nephew of Bishop Nicholas of the Eastern Orthodox Church,
and Miss Julia Metropolaky were married last evening in the Russian church,
on Powell street, the Bishop officiating at the elaborate and impressive
ceremony.
There were no floral decorations in the edifice. Countless tapers burned
upon the altar, heavily draped with white brocade, embroidered in gold, and
the air was heavily laden with Incense.
The ceremony, splendid in the extreme, was entirely conducted in Rus
sian, the unaccompanied choir chanting the responses in the same tongue.
The Bishop, clothed In robes of white brocade, richly embroidered in gold ond
glittering with pn-cious stones, thrice led the youthful couple around the holy
altar, thrice held the jeweled crowns above their heads, and thrice made them
drink of the blessed wine.
Rings were exchanged, and to the pleasure of a large audience that
crowded the gorgeous little church, the happy groom publicly proclaimed that
he took Julia Metropolsky to be*his lawfully wedded wife.
The bride was attended by Miss Lydia Molowonsky, who officiated as
maid of honor, and her two llttie sisters, Alexandria and Natalie Aletropolsky,
who acted as bridesmaids.
There were four groomsmen, George Metropolsky, George Dabovlch, Paul
Grebachevsky and George Tzikowris.
The bride was attired in a modish gown of white tulle over white taffeta.
A veil and orange blossoms completed the costume.
The maid of honor and bridesmaids were attired alike In white organdie
over white silk. After the ceremony the Bishop entertained the bridal party
and Invited ffoestfl in the parlors of the church, and then a reception fol
lowed at the home of the bride's parents on Union and Taylor streets.
Mr. Popoff. who Is at present a reader In the church, will, now that he
has taken unto h'.mself a wife, shortly be ordained a priest In the Eastern
Orthodox Church.
TROUBLES OF THE
SHAINS ARE OVER
Divorce Granted the Plaintiff in
the Litigation by Judge
Daingerfield.
ThÂ© Collector Ordered to Pay Hia
Family $75 Alimony Each
Succeeding Month.
The troubles of Joseph Shaln, the debt
collector, and Grace E. Shaln are at an
endâ that Is, as far as marital troubles
are concerned. Judge Daingerfield yes
terday granted the latter a divorce from
her husband on Lie ground of intemper
ance, and ordered that the collector pay
J75 a month toward the support of Mrs.
Sham and her two children until the
further order of the court. The granting
of the decree of divorce put an end to
a bitter legal contest, but during the
contest, the family skeleton of the liti
gants was dragged forth by the lawyers
with scant ceremony.
When the case was called yesterday
morning, after a rest of several days. At
torney Reid, who represented the de
fendant, requested the court to conduct
the case behind closed doors, as unfair
criticisms had been made. This the court
refused to do, and the trial proceeded.
Mrs. Shaln was recalled, and reiterated
her testimony given on the stand last
week. Many additional tales of trouble
were also told by Mrs. Sham, and all
went to substantiate her accusations
against her husband.
When she left the stand her husband
was recalled, and he shed some light on
several points that caused unhappiness
in his home. He told the story of his loss
of $10 000 on stocks and how and why he
left the city at that time and of the
trouble that loss brought to him and his.
He also explained to the court the com
plaint made against him that he had lost
much money playing the races. At first,
he said, he simply wagered a few dollars
on the horses when business took him to
the track, but later bet larger amounts.
His wife accompanied him several times
to the Bay District track, and when he
made good winnings he would always
irlve her a goodly share, that she might
enjoy life the more. His wife, he said,
never objected to his playing the races
as long as she profited thereby, but when
the difficulty arose between them she
counted his gambling propensities among
his multitude of sinful habits.
The case was argued after Mr. Shaln
left the stand, and shortly after it was
submitted Judge Daingerfield granted the
plaintiff a decree as prayed for. The at
torney representing Sham objected to the
order of the court granting alimony In
the sum of $73 a month, as he said it
was altogether too large an amount to
haiie a.Â« a Judgment over his client's
head The court, however, did not agree,
and ordered that the alimony be paid on
the 25th of each succeeding month. This
closc-d tho proceedings, and Mrs. Sliain,
with a smilt* of satisfaction on her face,
lnft the courtroom, accompanied by her
daughter.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Charles T>. McLellan filed suit against
his wife. Clara J. McLellan, for a divorce
Yesterday on the ground that the defend
ant had been convicted of a felony. Mrs.
Mcl.fllan is the woman who gained
much notoriety by looting an Oakland
house several months ago and who was
found guilty of burglary.
Charles McCarthy has applied for a di
vorce from Jennie McCarthy on the
ground of desertion.
Ella McDevitt has sued Edward F.
McDevltt for a divorce. As a cause of
action she alleges desertion.
Theodore Henry Hage asks the court to
grant him a divorce from his wife. Mary
E. Hage. Hage complains that his wife
deserted him some time ago and refuses
to return to her horn' 1 .
Cave Hl">*elf Up.
Eugene Hartnett surrendered himself
to Officer Benjamin last night on Polk
street, declaring himself to be a deserter
from the battleship Oregon. He paid he

to return. As the police had no evidence
of his desertion he was small-booked.

GREAT FIGHTS
IN PROSPECT
Choynski Will Leave Chicago
for This City in a
Few Days.
In Futura Pugilists Must Battle for
a Percentage of Re
ceipts.
The Choynskl and "Tut" Ryan twenty
round contest which will take place un
der the auspices of the Empire Athletic
Club, is booked for the evening of Feb
ruary 11, at Mechanics' Pavilion.
Eddie Graney, who is looking cut for
Choynski's interests on this coast, tele
graphed to the pugilist on Tuesday that
the match was made and that everything
pertaining to the mill had been satisfac
torily arranged. Choynski replied from
Chicago that he was in splendid condi
tion and would leave for the coast right
away.
Ryan has already commenced to train
for the match, and Lansing and Baker
are also hard at work taking off soft
flesh at their respective training stations.
Choynskl and Ryan will box twenty
rounds for a percentage of the receipts,
and Lansing and Baker will meet in a
ten-round "go"' for a percentage also.
In case the Supervisors grant permits to
the National and Occidental Clubsâ which
in all probability they will under certain
conditions â a conference will be held
among the managers of the three clubs
for the purpose of agreeing upon a schedr
ule of percentages or rates which the
pugilists must agree to or look elsewhere
for engagements.
Heretofore the clubs held out a game
among themselves tailed diamond cut
diamond, and as a result the lighters
carted off the heavyweight end of the
receipts, leaving, the clubs a small per
centage when the expanses that were at
tached to the game had been defrayed.
In future a new rule will be strictly
adhered to. At least the managers of the
clubs who are Interested in fisticuffs have
decided that the pugilists must be con
tented with percentages instead of fabul
oua purses, and if this proposed scheme
Is carried out by the clubs Interested In
the game, there will be a remarkable de
crease in the number of "swelled heads"
noticeable for some time past among the
army of pugilists located in this city.
Pe"ter Jackson Is training faithfully In
Alameda for anything that may turn up
In the way of a match. Peter Is toler
ably confident of meeting Peter Maher
In the near future. In fact. Young Mitch
ell of the Occidental Club received a let
ter of assurance from Manor not very
long ago that in case he (Mitchell) was
in a position to pull off a match between
the two Peters that he could safely
count upon him being in the ring on the
evening appointed for the huusewarm-
Ing.
At any rate Jackson has taken time by
the forelock, and to the surprise of his
many friends and admirers he is train-
Ing faithfully and will assuredly be in the
pink of condition when he is called upon
to give an account of himself.
Jeffries is at work in Alameda, He will
be among the favored ones who will have
a try for the long green at a near future
date. It Is hoped that he will be pitted
against -Sharkov, as there are thousands
of people In this city who are anxiously
waiting to see a tilt between tho tw<>
big heavy-weights, and what a smashing
contest it will be when they toe the
! scratch.
There will l>Â«Â» three *>lght -round con
tests at the Oakland Athletic Club rooms,
corner of B ft ml Hollis streets. Oakland,
this evening. i They are as follows: Jaki--
Bomgard vs. Josh Ward. Jack Burns vs.

DOC TUBERVILLE
AND OSTLER JOE
Too Strong a Combination
for "Skeets" Martin
on Mainstay.
Caspar Badly Beaten for the
Rich Reliance Club Han
dicap.
The Books Crippled Over the Victory
of Caetake, an Out
sider.
The Acme Club handicap, over six
and a half furlongs, was decided at
Oakland yesterday. It was worth $700
to the first horse and was taken by
the black horse Ostler Joe, with Doc
Tuberville up, ably assisted by "Skeets"
Martin astride Mainstay. The three
horses named were the only starters.
Caspar, the Burns ,?â¢ TVaterhouse en
try, carrying 115 pounds, was a 3 to 5
choice in the betting. Ostler Joe gen
erously weighted with 117 was liber
ally patronized in the books at odds of
2 to 1, while Mainstay was peddled
about at 10. At the post there was
considerable fiddling about before Fer
guson finally sent the trio away. Mar
tin hustled Mainstay out in the lead
and when challenged at the head of â¢
the stretch by Thorpe on Caspar, ran
the colt nearly to the outside fence.
During this piece of circus work Tu
borvllle saved much ground with the
black horse by making a short turn.
With Caspar turned upside down Mar
tin now turned his attention to Tuber
ville. Putting on the "reverse Eng
lish" he tried hard to give Doc the
run to the inner rail, but that rider
proved as good at the game as "Skeets"
and in a* hard drive won by a neck. Af
ter being interfered with," the favorite
fell back, finishing lengths behind. Con
sidering the condition of the track,
which was heavy and lumpy, the time
of the winnpr, I:24'^, was excellent.
Four heavily played favorites were

rocked to sleep, but It was by no means
a Golden Jubilee celebration for the
pencilers. In the final race of the
d;:y, Oastake, a gelding, which seems
to be able to run as fast as he wants
to at times, was barked down from
40 to 15 to 1, downing his field with
perfect impunity, and every book in
the ring sold pasteboards on the out
sider.
There was no pronounced choice in
the opening five and a half furlong
scramble. Aluminum, Einstein, Rram
bella and Monitor all coming in for
considt'talil' 1 support. "Rkeets" Mir
tin pot a llyiner s f :irt with Aluminum
and was never headed, winning with
something to spar^ from Brmmbdla.
which filly shows improving: form. Bine
Fsell secured show honors. Einstein
could not antrack himself. Monitor
was also a minus quality so far as
â peed vaa concerned.
Neil and Cmioy finally put up a rid^r
on their shifty youngster Cs.ta.WDA,
and ho rolled in before the 11 to 10
choice P.lnrm-yptone in the six-furlonp
â print following. "Skfets" Martin
nptride thf favorite led to the Btretch,
with Clawsnn on fatawba KtttlnÃ
straight und*>r wraps. Straightened
for the wire Clawson let out a link- and
hi? mount tumbled in five lengths
ahead of Elarneystone. Imperious,
away poorly, was third.
Louis Ezell scored again In the throe
furlong scramble for two-year-olds
with Buena Ventura. The filly was
an even money favorite at post time
and downed her company quite as eas
ily as she did at her first c-psay last
week, leading Bonibel out several
lengths at the finish. Caesar Young's
Clarando fell back a peg, winding up
in the show.
The consistent performer. Garland
Barr. took the mile selling run without
much effort. The ring tonk no liber
ties with him, laying even money most
of the tlmo, though 7 to E was procur

waited on Harry Thoburn until well
into the Ftr-itch, where he moved up
and won hands down. Souffle was a
distant third, badly beaten. Jones made
a bad mess of it at the post with Newfl
Gatherer, never being a factor.
If the stable backed Good Friend to
win the trainer should see a veterin
ary. The filly receded in the betting
from 3 to 2 to IVz to 1 and couldn't beat
herself. Lo Lo led the bunch to the
paddock where Castake got up and
won by a grin. Lucky Star fell from
the attic floor, taking the show.
Track lterr)S.
The I Don't Know race Saw finally reached a
focus. Seth Nichols, who managed the enjoy
able entertainment, has been warned off the
track. An "Injun" who promised to play the
horse flanked when he paw the short price,
and as Morse and Nichols were bound accord

must be did." One or two "funeral directors"
grot the cue and Morse, the jockey, did the
reft. Acordlne to the statement of Judge
Murphy, the latter had better migrate to the
Klondike, for he stands a poor chance of get
ting a license the coining season.
The win of Garland Barr was an expensive
one for Tom Ryan, as he was compelled to
stand a $700 raise. The gelding was entered
to be sold for |7<.K), and was boosted to $1400
by Jack Atkins, one of the. owners of Harry
Thoburn, which finished second. Ryan re
tained his horse with the usual $3 bid.

It took Jim Nell sometime to convince his

IN HER SON'S BEHALF-
Mrs. Mitchell's Contest in the h\e
don Estate Now BeÂ»ng Hjeard
by Judge Coffey.
The contest of Mrs. Mitchell to the ap
plication of the heirs of the estate of
Martin Kedon for a distribution of the
estate left by the decedent was again
opened before Judge Corfey yesterday.
Mrs. Mitchell, who claims to have en
tered Into a contract marriage with Ke
don some time prior to his death, objects
to the distribution of the estate until the
rights of her son, who she alleges is the
child of Kedon have been established
by the court and some provision made l>v
him. . .
Mrs. Mitchellâ Kedonâ was on the
stand yesterday, and told of the relations
with her alleged last husband. . She had
beet) intimate with him, she said, since
1878, and up to the time of Bis death he
always held her In " the highest regard'
After the birth of her boy Kedon always
provided for him. she said. On many
occasions the deceased introduced her as
his wife, .but preferred, even after the
contract marriage, that she either retain
her old name or go by that of Mrs. Mar
tin, which was his Christian name.
The son who the contestant alleges is
KÂ«Â»don's is now 19 years of age. His
mother believes that he is entitled to a
portion of Kedon's estate, and she will
make a strenuous effort to gain a Judg
ment in his. favor. .

WILL INCREASE
SUPERVISORS
Charter Makers Favor a
Board of Eighteen
Members.
They Will Be Elected at Large
as Under the Present
System
Dr. Anderson Advocated a Plan to
Hmvo Them Elected From the
Districts.
The Board of Freeholders spent sev
eral hours last night discussing the
proposed new legislative department of
the municipality. The sub-committe^e
appointed to draft a code at laws to
govern the legislative body reported in
favor of a Board of Supervisors con
sisting of eighteen members, who shall
be elected at large and who shall hold
office for two years, with the excep
tiim that the first board under the
charter, if it is adopted, shall so divide
itself by lot that nine members shall
go out at the expiration of the first
year and the other nine members at
the expiration of the second year, and
that thereafter nine members shall be
elected annually to the board.
Dr. Anderson offered as a substitute
for the measure a section providing
that the members of the Board of Su
pervisors shall be nominated at large,
but elected by districts. He also de
sired to have a clause inserted in the
charter providing that upon the filing
of a petition signed by twenty per cent
of the voters of a district the Election
Commissioners should call a special
election in that district.
Dr. Anderson argued that if the Su
pervisors were elected from districts
the voters would be able to better
Judge of the qualifications of the can
didates. He believed that the city
should be redlstricted into eighteen
wards, the same as Assembly districts.
Then in the event of a Supervisor
provina unfaithful to his trust 20 per
cent of the voters could compel the
Election Commissioners to call a spe
cial election to secure his removal. The
Supervisor whose removal was sought
would be allowed, however, to have
his name on the ticket, and in the
event of receiving a majority of the
votes cast he would be allowed to re
main in office, but if defeated his suc
cessor would at once take his seat and
complete the unexpired term.
The suggestion of Dr. Anderson
brought about a lengthy debate.
Ex-Mayor Ellert. P. H. McCarthy,
H. N. Clement and Joseph Comte were
opposed to the district system, as they
believed that no good would accrue
from it. They were of the opinion that
the Supervisors should be elected by
general ticket, as at present, and the
majority of the Freeholders were in
like frame of mind, for Dr. Anderson's
substitute was defeated and the sec
tion suggested by the committee kdont
ed.
The Freeholders npxt decided that no
person shall he eligible to the office of
Supervisor unless he has been for at
least five years continuously a quali
fied elector of the city and county.
The Freeholders will meet again to
morrow nitfht to decide on the powers
of the Supervisors.

HYMEN'S
PERCH IS
VACANT
Dame Rumor Has An
other Delectable
â¢ Morsel.
Jacob Samuels Goes to
Seattle and Leaves
His Bride.
A Story Circulated That They
No Longer Love Each
Other.
NOBODY WANTS TO TALK.
Pemzliar Aftermath of a Runaway
Matchâ A Story of Parental
Whether It be In accordance with the
old adage that the course of true love
never does run smooth, or whether It
be thnt matrimony in this degenerate
age is at best but a sort of lottery
game, the fact remains that the hy
meneal deity would seem to have flown
from his perch on the gable of the
house that formerly sheltered young
Jacob Samuels and his bride of hardly
more than a month. Miss Elizabeth Mc-
Donald, the daughter of the Oakland
capitalist, whose residence Is at 1353
Tenth avenue. Oakland.
It will be remembered that on No
vember 23 last the young couple gave
old Mother Grundy a most delectable
morsel to divide with the gossipers by
slipping quietly away on the train to
San Jose in the afternoon and being
married there In the evening by Justice
of the Peace Wallace. As Miss McDon
ald had been one of the leading belles
of Oakland and Samuels was well
known here on account of his connec
tion with Pamu-Ms' Lace House, the af
fair created a 'leal of talk, augmented,
perhaps, by the fact that the young
people were of different religious faiths
and that they had resorted to a run
away match.
In a short time, however, the wed
ding was forgotten so far as the sensa
tional feature was concerned. Now it
comes before the public In another
form, and Dame Rumor Is again wag
ging her tongue.
It was only a few days ago that a
story was circulated In town to the ef
fect that Samuels was at this time in
Seattle, his bride remaining at her
home in Oakland.
Naturally, this looked like a case of
desertion, and from the mysterious
manner In which the relatives of the
Interested parties endeavor to dodge all
queries in regard to the fact that the
twain are separated this belief will be
augmented.
Attorney Morris V. Samuels, brother
of Jacob Samuels, refused yesterday to
answer any questions put to him anent
the matter.
"There is nothing In the ca.se that
â¢would Interest the public," he said, and
that was an 'end of it so far as the
lawyer was concerned.
When Inquiry was made at the home
of the McDonalds in Oakland, the Chi
nese servant at first state 1 that Mrs.
Samuels was not at home, but finally
consented to let her mother be seen.
Mrs. McDonald volunteered nothing at
all. That Seattle was at present the
abode of young Samuels, she was will
lng to admit, and that was all. She
would not even say whether or not her
daughter was at home.
"There Js nothing at all In the Ftory
that concerns the public in any way,"
she curtly asserted.
SHE IS NOW f? WIFE.
Grace SKelly Taker) From the City '
Prison to Be Married.
Grace Bkelly, a pretty girl 18 years of ;
agre, was arrested yesterday morning at J
118 Grant avenue by Policeman T. J.
Coleman and taken to the City Prison,
where she was booked for a public in
stitution.
The girl was in trouble and learning
from her who had been keeping company
with her Tollman went to the young man
and he agreed to marry her rather than
see her pout to the Magdalen Asylum.
His name is John Bechler, the driver of
a poda water wagon, and he lives on
Lexington avenue. Bechler accompanied
Coleman to Cupid Danforth's office and
procured the necessary license. Then
Justice of the Peace Kerrigan was seen
and readily consented to perform the
ceremony.
Grace was escorted from the prison by
Coleman and her lover and in a few
minutes the Justice had tied the knot
and Grnce was saved from being sent to
the Magdalen.
Failure to Provide.
Jerome Schroeder, 548 Folsom street,
swore to a complaint in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday for the arrest of his
brother-in-law, Dennis Kelleher, on a
charge of failing to provide for his child.
Kelleher deserted his young wife about
eighteen months ago to live with another
woman and the child was born after tho
desertion. The wife has had to support
herself and child and now wants the
father to help a little. Kelleher was ar
rested yesterday afternoon.

WOLLWEBBER
WAS TOLD
TO RESIGN
Why the Ex-Sergeant
Quit the Police
Department.
He Neglected His Family
for a Waitress in
a Dive.
Confronted by His Guilt He Is
Allowed to Surrender
His Star.
DID NOT WANT PUBLICITY.
The "Woman in the Case Is Well
Known to the Police
Officers.
Ex-Sergeant of Police Ous Wollweb
ber did not resign his position on ac
count of 111 health, as was stated, but
was forced to do so by the Police Com
missioners. This fact was developed at
the meeting of the Commissioners last
night.
For a number of years Wollwebber
did duty as patrolman and made a
brilliant record. On account of his
strict attention to business the Com
missioners realizing his worth made
him sergeant. It would seem that his
promotion has resulted in hi? downfall.
Shortly after he was made sergeant
he was detailed to the California-street
Station. His district took in the Bar
bary Coast and North Beach. While in
search of his men in the former sec
tion he met a woman who, it is said,
captivated him completely. Notwith
standing that he has a wife and sev
eral children he fell a victim to her
charms. Her name is Rosie St. Clair.
She works as a waitress in the Coli
seum saloon at Jackson and Kearny
streets. From what has been learned
Wollwebber, instead of attending to his
duties, nightly met the woman, fre
quently failing to meet the officers who
were under him. His conduct became
so notorious that his wife learned of it.
It is said that she at once communi
cated with Chief Lees and asked that
her husband be disciplined. Chief Lees
had her write a letter to him detailing
the facts of the husband's liaison with
the waitress. A few days later he re
ceived the letter and after reading it he
at once sent it to Commissioner Tobln,
the president of the board. As Mr.
Tobin had been the cause of promoting
Wollwehber he became angry and or
dered Chief Lees to make a thorough
Investigation.
The latter detailed a detective to
watch Wollwebber, and what he saw
thoroughly convinced him that the ex-
Sergeant was not attending to his du
ties. He made a written report of his
investigations to the Chief of Police,
which was sent to the Commissioners.
After reading It they became
convinced of "Wollwebber's lnat
tfntkm to police duty and or
dered the chiff to prefer charges
against him. Rather than have him
suffer the humiliation of being publicly
disgraced, the head of the department
summoned him before him. The report
of the detective was then read to Woll
webber and he admitted his guilt.
"Don't bring me before the Commis
sioners," he is said to have remarked.
"Rather than face them I will resign."
Chief Lees told him that was the best
course to pursue, and he Immediately
called in Captain Healy, his chief clerk.
Wollwebber then wrote out his resigna
tion, which he handed to* Chief Lees,
with the remark, "You have always
been my friend." Healy took the resig
nation and subsequently informed the
Commissioners of Wollwebber's action.
The Commissioners met the follow
ing night, and after the resignation
was read it was promptly accepted.
It is said that since Wollwebber re
signed, the woman who is responsible
for his downfall has refused to recog
nize him.
When seen by a reporter last night
Captain Wittman refused to discuss
Wollwebber's resignation. "I know
nothing about it," he said, "you will
have to see the Commissioners."
Shortly before he resigned Wollweb
ber was transferred to the O'Farrel'.
street station, as his superior officers
had an inkling of his affection for the
waitress. Notwithstanding his sup
posed banishment, it is claimed he
managed to meet the womdn, which
fact became known to his wife. It was
then she concluded to inform the Com
missioners of her husband's doings.
POLITICAL FfIKES.
Dr. Willey Shows Soroc Figures
at the TurK-Street
Temple.
Dr. "W. M. Willev's lecture on"Politio.il
Fakes and Fakers" was the attraction
which drew a largo audience to the Turk-
Ktrof-t Temple last night. The speaker
illustrated his lecture with two chartsâ
the one showing what parties had held
sway and the platforms on which the
various Presidents were fleeted since ISOO,
and the other showing; the wealth of the
country at various stages during the last
half-century; what percentage of it has
!â â  i d held by the capitalists and what
percentage was paid to labor.
According to Dr. Willey's charts. In 1850
of the wealth distributed in this coun
try capital received S7& per cent and
labor fi2V> per cent. During the
succeeding years the wealth gradually
increases, capital's share also increasing,
while labor's percentage gradually goes
down, until in 1890 the capitalists got
S3 per cent of it and the laborers but 17.
The object of the lecture was to prove
that the various platforms of free silver,
protection, free trade, etc.. which have
from time to time been made political
issues have been but tricks of the politi
cians to keep the minds of the people
away from the real question of the day.
as during the past fifty years all these
remedies for the social condition have
been tried at some time, and the condi
tion of the laboring man has gradually
beÂ«n growing worse and worse. He at

machinery, and suggests the doctrine <.'r

DEPARTMENT AGAINST HIM
Vice- Principal McCarthy of the
Washington Grammar School
Says Bitter Things.
If Auditor Broderlck again seeks pub
lic office he will find the teachers in
the public schools united to give him
battle. At the last election, Broderick
had the teachers Interested in his cam
paign, and they fought hard and ear
nestly for him. His refusal to sign the
demands against the treasury in favor
of A. C. Widber, treasurer Â»f the
school teachers' annuity fund, has
raised a storm, however, that will
break in all its force in the event of
him again going before the people for
support at the polls. The teachers be
lieve that Auditor Broderick has acted
without warrant of law in refusing to
sign the annuity demands, and it is
their intention to commence proceed
ings to compel him to perform what
they consider to be his duty.
"We intend giving Auditor Broderick
an opportunity to defend the position
he has taken,"' said T. H. McCarthy,
vice principal of the Washington
Grammar School, yesterday afternoon,
"and we feel certain that before we are
finished he will conclude that as an in
terpreter of the law he is a failure.
The teachers," added McCarthy, "do
not intend quietly submitting to Au
ditor Broderick's interpretation of the
law governing the annuity fund. I was
one of the framers of the law under
which the annuity fund was create 1.
and 1 feel certain that when we bring
mandamus proceedings against the Au
ditor to compel him to d<> his duty we
will be able to prove conclusively that
Auditor Broderick is not a Supreme
<'<>urt in Olsgttlse. If the law is un
constitutional we will bow to the de
cision of the courts, but we do nut rec
ognize the Auditor as an authority on
the interpretation of the law. How was
the annuity fund created? In a very
pimple way.
"The teachers in the public schools
realized that some of their number had
outlived their usefulness. They had
given the better portion of their life to
the education of the young and we did
not want to see them thrown out of the
department after all their years of ser
vice. Now It is a rule of the depart
ment that teachers be 'docked' for the
time they are absent from school. The
substitute who fills the place of a reg
ular teacher receives only on^-half of
the salary paid the other. We accord
ingly thought that in equity one-half
of th" amount deducted from the sal
ary of the teacher might in all fairness
be placed to the credit of a fund to
pension off other teachers who had
broken down in the service."
The School Department is the only

that does not allow salary to absent
employes. If a deputy is prevented by
sickness or, other 'causes from attend
ing to his duties In the office of the
County Clerk. Sheriff or Collector, there
is no deduction made from his salary.
Now -we teachers are not allowed for
the days we are absent and our sub
stitues only receive one-half of our
pay. We believed that no obiection j
could be possibly raised to the creation i
of an annuity fund by diverting: one- '
half of what the municipality pained !
by the absence of repular teachers, to !
a fund to assist those who by lonp !
years of service had worn themselves :
out. The city Is saininp by the law.
TVachers who are unable to fulfill the â 
duties expected of them have taken ad- !
vantape of the law and retired, mak- j
lnp room for younger and possibly ;
brighter educators. It remained for |
Auditor Proderick. however, to dis
cover that the law was unconstltu- â 
tional.
"Before the flcht is over I predict 'â 
that he will find that the law is con
itltuttonal and that he is unpopular in
the department. Ppeaking for my
self, I can say that I am sorry that
Broderick gained assistance to office by
my vote or support. lamof an ap

bettering that he would not prove a j
stumbling block in the way of the
School TSppartment. You can now
qm>te me as saying that the Interest I
took in his election will be turned the
next time he runs for office to secure
his defeat. You can also state through
th.? medium of The Call that the teach
ers arp sorry to see that the Auditnr
i^ Tcting also as Judge. The State
made the laws under which the an
nuity fund was created, and tip to the
present time I believed the State was
sovereign. It appears now that one
William Broderick. Auditor of the city !
and county of San Francisco, by grace
of th<> people, is superior to the State i
âat least he thinks he is. It is no '
part of tho duties of the Auditor to
construe laws. He seems, however, to
think his Judgment better than that |
of the Board of Kducatlon and the Su- !
perintendent of Schools. The demands
he has refused to audit hav^ been
signed by the School Directors and the â 
School Superintendent, and I think that
th<'.v are as responsible to the people as
the Auditor. Mr. Broderick has set
himself up as a Judicial as well as an
executive officer. "U'hen the manda
mus proceedings we Intend bringing
against the A-iditor are heard in court
I feel satisfied that the decision will
be that he had better leave the Judi
cial part of the municipality's govern- :
ment alone."

sixty-five and seventy feet.
About throe months . ago Lund, while

the roof open. He ran downstairs to the
rear and saw Lund huddled up on the

He immediately notified Mrs. Lund,

NOT A POUND
OF COAL
FOR SALE

There Is not a pound of coal for sale
In San Francisco to-day, except at a
few of the small retail yards in the
residence districts. The bunkers of the
wholesale dealers were cleaned out
yesterday. On Tuesday afternoon the
Dunsmulr yards were closed and the
string of coal carts waiting at the
pates were turned to other dealers fÂ«>r
loads. To-day Rosenfeld, Chandler.

Coal Company refused to sell to deal

their yards they reserved to fill the
outstanding contracts for fuel they
have with large consumers. All yes
terday a string of carts went from one
coal yard to another begging for a
load, but they went away empty from
every one of them. No coal was to be
had.
The vessels now in the coal carrying
trade are not equal to supply the de
mand. Many of the steamers that a
few months ago were bringing coal
cargoes from the Sound ports have
been chartered for the promised Alaska
trade, and they are now being changed
from colliers to carriers of fortune
seekers. A few weeks ago when there
was a promised scarcity of coal carry
ing vessels the owners of suitable ships
agreed on a demand of an advance of
25 cents a ton for bringing coal from
Puget Sound ports to San Francisco.
The coal dealers refused to pay the de
manded advance and the ship owners
in preference to taking cargoes at the
present low rate put many of their ves
sels in Oakland Creek, preferring to
lay them up in the mud rather than
take such a low charter price. Even
if all the now available vessels in the
port or still in the trade were running
they would not be able to carry enough
coal to keep the supply equal to the
The recent bad weather along the
coast has detained the vessels now in
the trade to a considerable extent and
kept back many cargoes, but coal deal
ers say that amounts to a very little
in comparison to what will follow
within the next sixty days. They pre- |
diet a serious coal famine. All the coal |

next two months amounts to only 47,
000 tons. The consumption of the city
and vicinity in that time will be about
240.000 tons. To keep even with the de
mand vessels will be required to carry
200,000 tons to this harbor from the
Puget Sound and Oregon mines in the
next sixty days, and there are not
enough ships disengaged on the coast
to do it.
On Saturday last a cargo of 600 tons
arrived early in the morning from
Coos Bay, and the vessel was met at
the wharf with a string of carts reach
ing nearly a third of a mile. The first
of the string of carts stood over twelve
hours waiting for the coal at the bunk
ers where the vessel would discharge
her load. The cargo was carted away
as fast as it could be hoisted out of
the hatches.
SHE WOS NOT A CRIMINAL.
fin Old Woroar) Charged With Ob-
tairjiog Money Under False
Pretenses Acquitted.
Mrs. Annie Ross, a woman tottering i
with ape, was on trial before Jud^e Wal
lace yesterday on a charge of obtaining i
| money under false pretenses. The com- i
plaininp witness npainst her was E. S.
BoneUt, and ho alleged that the prisoner
"had procured $140 as a loan on some fur
niture in â  hmise at 505 Jones street,
which she claimed was unineumbered.
The complainant afterward discovered
that a chattle mortÃase on the furniture |
! of $12=; was already In the possession of
I the Pacific Loan and Investment <'>>m
pnny. In consequence of the second mort
gage Bonelli alleged that he had been

After all the testimony in the case had
been heard JudÃe Wallace turned to tho
jury and said: "Gentlemen of the jury.
are you willing to decide this case with
out arpument or Instructions from the
court ">" The iury answered in the affirma
tive and filed out. A few minutes it re
turned to the court and found the de
fendant not guilty.
The verdict apparently pleased every
! one !n the room with the exception of the
complainant. Tho aged prisoner was then
lib.-rat^d and she left the building ac
companied by sympathetic friends.
Jesuits Will Conduct a Mission.
A mission under the direction of the
Jesuit priests. Fathers Finnipan and Van
de Erden, will be conducted at St. Charles
Church, commencing next Sunday morn
ins and continuing for two weeks.
During the mission special services will
be held every morning and evening.
Father Kalcia will deliver a sermon at
St. Ignatius Sunday morning, January 30,
on the subject of "Dreams." This subject
is the second of this character chosen by
Father Kalcia to exnound. the first being
on the subject of fortune-telling and the
absurdity of an existing belief in a proph
ecy of human destiny. The subject bids
fair to be as fully interesting and novel
as anything ever chosen as a text for a
sermon. Rev. Father Freiden, president !
of the Society of Jesus on this coast, will
arrive in the city to-morrow evening,
after an absence of six days at San Jose.
