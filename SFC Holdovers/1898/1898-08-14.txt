Admiral Sampson at once decided to
go to the western extremity of Jamaica
to intercept Blanco, should he attempt
to escape in that direction. The flag
ship made sixteen knots an hour, de
spite the foulness of her bottom, and
arrived off Jamaica yesterday morning

alleging breach of promise to marry.
She asserts that Corbin, under promise
of marriage, accomplished her ruin in
this city in 1891; that, continuing his
promises, he took her in his private car

MEN WHO

Personnel of the Peace

ject of Interest.
Many Problems That Now Con
front the Administration
at Washington.
NEW YORK Aug. 13.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: The most important task
imposed on the President at this time
is the selection of five American mem
bers of the joint commission to deter
mine the fate of the Philippines.
Secretary's Day's name is the only
one that can be put down with abso
lute certainty on the list of commis
sioners. A name that has not been
mentioned is that of Joseph Choate of
New York, and there may be much
significance in the fact that the Presi
dent mentioned his name as a possi
bility to a caller who was talking in
behalf of another man.
There are reports to-day in adminis
tration circles that the selection of
Senators Allison and Gorman is not as
likely as was supposed a few days ago.
The reason given is that neither of
these Senators is a member of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, and
that if any Senator is to be on the
commission it should be a member of
the committeee which will have charge
of the peace treaty.
It is said with much positlveness to
night that Secretary of State Day will
retire from the State Department on
September 15, which is about the date
that the Peace Commission will have to
start for Paris, and that he will be
succeeded by Ambassador Hay.
President McKinley is not yet pre
pared to definitely announce the names
at the army and navy officers who will
repress it the United States on the Joint
military commission to arrange the de
tails of tfte Spanish evacuation of Cuba
and Porto Rico.
Unless there is a change in the pres
ent determination of the President, the*
Porto Rican commission will be made
up of Major General John R. Brooke,
Brigadier General Guy V. Henry and
Captain William M. Folger, commander
of the cruiser New Orleans. It is ex
pected that both the commissions will
be announced early next week.
GETTING IN SHAPE FOR
CONDITIONS OF PEACE
Important Details That Will Have to
Be Attended to at Washington
for Some Time.
â WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.â The sud
den transition from war to peace was
reflected to-day in a complete dullness
and stagnation through official circles.
There will be a large amount of im
portant details to be worked out from
this time forward â a gradual reduction
of the army and navy to peace foot
ings, the establishment of temporary
and permanent administration for our
new colonial possessions, caring for the
prisoners and the relief of the distress
in Cuba.
The question of immediate attention
is the appointment of the peace com
mission which is to meet at Paris, and
of the military commissions to meet at
Havana and San Juan.
The President conferred with Secre
tary Day during the day relative to the
peace commission, but it was said at
the State Department late In the day
that an announcement of the commis
sioners might be deferred for some
days.
Several public men who saw the
President to-day were satisfied the com
mission would be made up of Secretary
Day, Senators Allison and Gorman,
either Joseph K. Choate or Ellhu Root
of New York, and probably a promi
nent army officer. General Corbin is
spoken of favorably in connection with
the army appointment on the commis
sion. The military commissions for
Cuba and Porto Rico are not receiving
any attention from the State Depart
ment as the military authorities will
have entire charge of these branches
of the peace settlement.
Many congratulations kept coming to
the State Department and to the White
House on the establishment of peace.
It is expected that the occupation of
Manila under the terms of the protocol
will occur within the next few days.
It was first thought the Navy Depart
ment had a dispatch-boat at Hong
kong, ready to cany forward the or
ders to Admiral Dewey and General
Merritt, but the department learned to
night that no dispatch-boat was at
Hongkong, although one was likely to
reach there to-day or to-morrow.
Meanwhile it is possible that Consul
Wildman may charter a steamer and
send the orders forward. He has gen
eral instructions as dispatch agent, and
it was said at f he State Department
to-day that the instructions govern in
the present case.
General Greely is satisfied no use can
be made of the cable connecting Hong
kong with Manila, as there are no ca
ble operators at the Manila end.
Acting Secretary Allen said to-day
that the matter of establishing coaling
stations, the disposition of Admiral Cer
vera and other Spanish prisoners, and
like questions brought up by the peace
settlement would receive consideration
in due time, but that there was no im
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
mediate necessity for passing upon
them.
The AVar Department was busy all
day with matters pertaining to cessa
tion of hostilities. Secretary Alger con
sulted the President for some time, but
when he returned said that the mili
tary commissioners for Cuba and Porto
Rico would not be announced to-day.
There is .no need of haste, he said, as
by the terms of the protocol ten days
were allowed for the selection of the
commission.
There has been some speculation as
to who will be commissioners, and
nearly all of the more prominent offi
cers of the army have been canvassed,
both volunteer and regular. It seems
to be generally conceded that General
Lee will be one of the commissioners
for Cuba, on acount of his knowledge
of the conditions in the island. Gen
eral Brooke and General Henry are
mentioned as probable commissioners
for Porto Rico.
The subject of mustering out a part
of the volunteer forces has been con
sidered and it is probable the total
force will be reduced to 100,000. This
mustering out will not begin at once.
Garrisons of both regular and volun
teer soldiers will remain in Cuba, Porto
Rico and the Philippines. Manila and
Porto Rico will be governed through
the military arm at present and prob
ably the authority which the United
States exerts in Cuba by the same
method. This state ot things is likely
to continue until Congress meets.
It is understood at the War Depart
ment that the Spanish soldiers in all
places over which the United States
exercises jurisdiction will be virtually
prisoners of war and under the orders
of the United States officers in com
mand.
TO KEEP UP OUR ARMY
FOR GARRISON DUTY
NEW YORK, Aug. 13.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: The army will not now
be scattered. It will be kept consoli
dated, at least until the question of
garrisons for Porto Rico, Cuba and the
Philippines has been specifically de
cided upon. This was the statement
Secretary Alger made to me this morn
ing.
"The troops at Montauk Point will
not be immediately assigned to sta
tions," he continued. "The work of
garrisoning the islands must be taken
up before any change in the organiza
tion of the army is perfected. Un
doubtedly a large force will be re
quired in Cuba. These troops will be
put at different important points in
Cuba. The regiments that will go have
not yet been designated. It will be the
policy of the administration to have all
the States represented as far as possi
ble, so that there may be no possible
basis for complaint or unjust discrim
ination, which it is desired to avoid.
"An army will remain in Porto Rico.
I am not certain that it will be in
creased, as that seems most tractable
territory, and as wo are in full pos
session with no doubt or contest as to
our claim. But it will take a much
larger force to garrison Cuba and ad
ditional troops will be sent over as soon
as, from a sanitary point, it is safe to
do so."

AN ARMISTICE
AT SUMMERLAND
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 13.âHos
tilities have not yet been resumed at
Sumnjerland. The people ha^e been
tracing step by step the cunningly laid
scheme of the corporation to seize
Summe-rland by a coup d'etat. Inter
esting facts hearing: on the scheme are
coming to light every day.
Treadwell, the Southern Pacific
agent, first located and recorded, in
the name of one Davis and others, a
lot of fictitious placer mining, claims
over patented pueblo lands granted in
private ownership, and over the lands
below high water mark on the Sum
merland beach. It is known that these
claims were recorded by and on behalf
of Treadwell, though in other sanies.
Then Treadwell applied to the Boar'l of
Supervisors for a wharf franchise.
This was opposed by H. L. Williams,
who had a franchise about expiring,
his pecuniary circumstances not hav
ing permitted him to build the wha;f
in time. The Board of Supervisors
were urged to and did ignore Mr. Wil
liams' contest on the ground that
Treadwell was ready to go aJiead and
accommodate the people with a wharf
for commercial purposes, which was
sadly needed to compete with the
grasping Southern Pacific Company.
In obtaining the franchise Treadwell
selected an attorney not identified with
the business of the Southern Pacific
Company. His franchise once obtained
he began to show his hand. He bored
a well on the beach at the foot of hijs
wharf and kept on keeping pace in
weiis with the growth of the wharf.
His franchise was a practical joke on
the Board of Supervisors of the county.
He then began to openly brag of being
"backed by the Southern Pacific Com
pany's capital. He claimed the control
of the railroad rights of way along the
roadbed and told Thomas D. Wood if
he wished a siding for shipments of his
oil he (Treadwell) would promote it or
could grant it, as he held this land of
the Southern Pacific Company along
the beach under lease.
His first discomtiture was the ac
quiring by Mr. Wood from H. L. Wil
liams of a large tract of oil land front
ing the beach. When Treadwell started
out with his fence along the beach he
met with resistance. Then the attor
of the Southern Pacific appeared
upon the scene of action and the legal
bluff began. Agreements of comprom
ise- were finally drawn up and ten
dered, in which Treadwell, in the name
of Mr. Davis of Elizabeth, N. J., and
in his own name, agreed to do most
anything if he were onlya'lowed to run
by with his so-called whan", but they
were not so easily deceived. His would
be dupes knew full well that once
across the lands of the State with its
wharf the Southern Pacific Company
would laugh them to scorn.
These recent acts of the Southern Pa
cific Company have caused the commu
nity to consider and deeply resent th 2
treatment of Santa Barbara by this
corporation in reference to connecting
this section with the outside world,
having violated all its pledges in re
gard to the closing of the gap, which is
about fifty miles in length, and the
dosing of whic-h would make a direct
line from San Francisco to Los Ange
los through Santa Barbara, thus short
ening the distance and time greatly be
n this part of the State and th^
northern part. The determination was
expressed to-day by parties who had
granted rights of way or executed con
tracts for grants of rights of way to
immediately serve notices of recession
and to commence proceedings to work
a forfeiture of the grants.

STRICT NEUTRALITY
GERMANY'S POLICY
FROM THE START
Acting Chief of the Berlin For
eign Office Speaks of
the War.
Hostility of the Press of His Country Due to
a Misconception of the Motives of
the United States.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Aug. 13.â The Associated
Press correspondent here has had an
interesting interview, on the subject of
the Spanish-American war, with a gren
tl'-man, who, in the absence of Baron
yon Buelow, who is away on his sum
mer holidays, is acting chief of the For
eign Office, and who may be regarded
as voicing in this conversation the gen
eral official view of the subject dis
cussed.
The gentleman began by saying:
"Baron yon Buelow, on leaving, cau
tioned me that no expression of opin
ion contrary to Germany's policy of
strict neutrality was to be promulgated.
That we mean to observe neutrality
of this description I think the world
now knows. From the start the For
eign Office has made it invariable io
say nothing that could be interpreted
as offensive to either side, and we have
in no way tried to influence the Ger
man press in favor of the United
States, except on a single occasion. At
first there was so much hostlily on the
part of the German press toward the
United States that we took every op
portunity to arrange for the appear
ance of articles of a different tone.
â¢'Almost the only affinity existing be
tween Germany and Spain is found in
the monarchical institution, while the
bonds uniting Germany and the United
States are numerous. It is true that
at the commencement of the war Ger
mans were much influenced by the fact
that a powerful nation was attacking
a weak one. This was a strong strain
upon German idealism, and the sense
of justice which characterizes the Ger- i
man people, and the mere fact that j
you were the aggressors in this case ]
somewhat prejudiced the German mind
against you. quite irrespective of the
merits of the controversy. Besides, it j
must not be forgotten that Germans, in ;
the matter of political education, are
still somewhat unripe. â  It is not long
since they became a homogeneous po
litical entity. It is partly <lue to this
fact that Germans jare given to reach,-, i
ing hasty conclusions on questions oM
politics. Hence sprang a great amount
of public comment in favor of Spain
in the earlier stages of the war. Such
talk, however, ought not to be quoted
against the German Government, in re
gard to which there has been, I think,
no just cause of complaint by Ameri
cans."
As a matter of fact, during* the past
fortnight the tone of the German press
has been much more favorable to the i
United States, and hardly anything di
rectly hostile has appeared in any of
the more important papers, while .the
number of. journals openly friendly has
considerably increased. The papers
now point out that the authorities at ;
Madrid and Manila and the Spanish |
press were largely responsible for the
excitement rising out of the Irene inoi
dent, as they, misconstrued it, and pre- |
ceding incidents in a mariner that
necessarily aroused suspicion in the
United States.
A good sample of the average, of the I
editorial articles nowadays is furnished j
in the Lokal Anzeiger, until recently |
one of the most violent anti-American !
sheets in Berlin. In an article printed
to-day this journal draws a parallel i
between the Turko-Greclan and the i
Spanish- American wars, and says -that

PEACE CHANGES SITUATION
DEPARTMENT AWAITS WORD
FROM MERRITT.
Unless He Asks for Reinforcements
the Men Now at San Francisco
Will Not Be Sent to
Manila,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 13.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
i sends the following: A cable dispatch
â  went to General Merritt last night from
the War Department asking if he
needed any more troops. The inquiry
from the Government was prompted
I by the belief that the troops already
j in Manila would be sufficient for gar
; rison purposes. General Merritt has
with him now 11,000 troops, and 4000
! more are on the way. The present
plan, therefore, of the administration
I seems to be that the 5000 which were
originally intended to be part of the
expedition for which Secretary Alger
urged General Merriam a few days ago
to provide transports shall not now be
sent to Manila. It is not supposed un
] der present circumstances that Gene-
I ral Merritt in his reply will ask for
I more troops.
] asked Secretary Alger to-day if he
would point out to me Just about what
| the situation would Jje.ln Manila under
; the protocol, as far as it concerned
; Spanish and American troops. I re
minded him that no provision had been
made as to the manner of evacuation
of Manila by Spanish troops, and asked
him what would be their status in t-hÂ»
interim.
He told me that in the first place
there was no dmibt that the Spanish
j army under orders from the Madrid
j Government would cease hostilities and

is mainly in the fact that Greece was
the attacking, and, not like Spain, the
attacked power.
This, the Lokal Anzeiger goes on to
say, was only a formal difference, for
Spain, after annoying and injuring a
powerful neighbor for a long time, had
finally engaged in a war for which she
had not the necessary strength. To
defend her possessions only imposed
sacrifices upon her, and she was bound
to lose. If, on the other hand, she had
sold these colonies, she would have
realized a large sum.
"By her unreasonable attitude," the
Lokal Anzeiger continues, "Spain as
sumed as large a measure of responsi
bility as Greece. Both Spaniards and
i Greeks are blind and full of conceit."
The newspapers here to-day discuss
elaborately the new situation and the
changed conditions growing out of the
war. The conclusion reached is that
the United States must hereafter be
reckoned a great naval power, and that
Germany will be obliged once more to
increase her navy in order to hold her
own with the other powers.
The Deutsche Zeitung, discussing the
annexation of Hawaii and plans of the
United States as regards Pago Pago,
says:
"This means a chane-e in the balance
of power in the South Sea, regarding
! which Germany cannot afford to be
silent."
The paper concludes a somewhat ag
gressive article by saying:
"We have confidence that the leaders
of our foreign policy will do all that
is required to prevent the disturbance
of German interests and influence in
Samoa."
The Vossische Zeitung says that the
war has ended as the majority of com
petent judges expected from the begin
ning that it would end. Spain, the
Vossische Zeitung says, undertook tho
I struggle without a chance of success.
' The Americans, the article says, owe
! their success, besides their military su
; peridrity, to a harmonious joining of
I all important factors.
Admiral yon Knorr, commander-in
chief of the imperial navy, Informs the
correspondent of the Associated Press
that during the approach of autumn
and winter the German navy will be
more strongly represented in American
waters than at any time since 1891,
wlihii Germany took a leading part in
the settlement of the Chilean trouble.
Five warships â the Geier, Hela, Moltke,
Sophie and Nixo â with a total tonnage
of 10,500, and carrying fifty-seven guns
and 1534 men, will be kept there.
The meat famine that prevails
throughout Germany is causing much
dissatisfaction aniong the poor, who are
unable to payttie increased prices. Vil
lagers on the Silesian frontier daily
cross the line and visit the nearest
Russian towns to procure cheap meat.
The Berlin butchers this week promul
gated resolutions expressing indigna
tion at the Government's policy of pre
venting meat imports, which has
caused a great scarcity of meat in the
home market.
Emperor William has finally decided
that the city of Berlin may accept a
legacy of several millions of marks left

Bladt, on condition that a statue be
erected to his memory. The case has

tion looked likp a simple one.
'"It is true," said Secretary Alger,
"thilt we may be called upon to help

I ila, but the soldiers would be practi
cally regarded as our prisoners, and
! United States troops will be as much

Fetes Being Organized to Cheer the

CADIZ, Aug. 13.â The so-called flying
squadron, consisting of Alfonso XIII,
Buenos Ayres and Ciudad de Cadiz, in
command of Captain Barraza, is being
prepared to go to Southampton to most
Ocrvera's men. It is unknown yet at
what Spanish port Cervera will land.
The French steamer Cheribon, char
tered for the repatriation of the Span
ish troops, has sailed for Santiago,
where she is due on August 23. She
has accommodations for more than 1000
troops.
This town is quite gay again. Peo
ple are organizing fetes to raise their
drooping spirits and to attract visitors
to the city. The gates, which have
been closed since the war, are now re
opened and remain open all night. The
fleet has been continuing its target ex
ercises. The results are fair.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Aug. 13.â A New Orleans
special to the Transcript says: The
transport Berlin arrived yesterday.
There is considerable importance at
tached to her voyage. Just as she was
preparing to leave Santiago there came
a rush message from Shafter to wait
for four passengers.
The quartet proved to be Colonel
Dick, Captains Mason and McKittrick
(the latter Shafter'a California son-in
law appointed from civil life) and Dr.
Goodfellow. They are the bearers of
dispatches to McKinley and Alger. Os
tensibly their mission is to acquaint
the authorities with the true condition
of affairs in Santiago. They will show
that the "round robin" was written
with Shafter's knowledge, consent and
aid. That the state of the troops was
really desperate and that the object
of the combined appeal was to bring
speedy release and not to reflect upon
the War Department. That is only
one of their missions, and will serve
to satisfy Roosevelt and other officers
who are supposed to have incited re
sentment by talking too plainly.
Dick is a political leader in the Ohio
stalwart counsels, and it is safe to
say that he is charged with matters of
much more confidential and momentous
bearing.
The public has all alonf been led to
believe that Lee was intended to rep
resent American arms and diplomacy
in Cuba after the struggle. There has
been no definite promise and no
authorized announcement â just a sort
of general understanding, but it is a
misunderstanding. Shafter has been
the administration candidate from the
very start, and his assuming the re
sponsibility of complaints construed
into reflections upon Alger's manage
ment will not affect his title. It will
only serve to make him the head and
front of the offending and make it
easier for him to do all the explaining
properly and aid his popularity with
out injuring the administration. When
Dick leaves Washington again the
whole question probably will have been
settled, the patronage decided and
other little private matters arranged
which could not well be trusted to mail
or cable.
What will become of Lee is another
question. He had his own place as
Consul General on plain or practical
American lines without regard to
party, and when placed in command of
the large camp at Jacksonville proved
himsolf equally capable.
The sanitary arrangements are per
fect and the rules strictly enforced.
The city is guarded against disorderly
invasion. The sick are cared for at

EXCESSES AND OVER-
INDULGENCE THE TRUE CAUSE

PRESS OF PARIS
BELIEVES WAR IS
CLOSE AT HAND
Opinion General That Russia and
England Will Measure
Swords.
France Entertains the Idea That America Will
Lend Armed Support to Great
Britain.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, Aug. 13.â As to the situation
in the far east, there is a tone of satis
faction noticeable in such papers as
comment upon this matter because
England has apparently received a
check. The trouble in the east is in
fact the dominant note in the French
press now that the Spanish-American
war is sinking into the background for
the time being. Most French papers
devote their leading articles to the
situation in China, and there is but one
opinionâ namely, that Russia and Eng
land will measure swords before long.
Both countries are getting themselves
into positions whence it will be impos
sible for them to withdraw or go for
ward, and that means war.
The Soleil is one of the serious roy
alist papers here. Its leading article
on Thursday put French opinion in a
very decided form. This article is
headed "The Giant." Its subject is the
extraordinary growth of the United
States foreign commerce during the
year that closed July 1.
"This enormous increase over last
year," says the Soliel, "shows that war
has not prevented the expansion of the
United States. On the contrary this
war is only a prelude to the tragedy
that is going to be played upon the in
ternational stage, in which the United
States will have the principal role.
Spain is the first obstacle the United
States has encountered upon the road
to their development. They have swept
it away with as much ease as a cat
would kill a mouse. We believe the
ominous cloud that is moving across
from the Philippines seems about to
break in the far east."
In fact, most of the papers here ap
pear to think a conflict is inevitable.
Although not always openly expressed,
underlying most of the comment it is
plain there is an idea that the Eng
lish and the Americans will stand
shoulder to shoulder in any complica
tion that may arise in China.
IMPERIAL CUSTOMS
UNDER RUSSIAN CONTROL
LONDON, Aug. 13.â A special from
Shanghai, received here to-day, says:
The China Gazette states that the Rus

Chang's promise, made during his visit
to St. Petersburg, that China would
place the imperial customs under Rus
sian control whenever the interests of
the two countries demanded the
change.
Li Hung Chang is said to favor M.
Pavloff, the Russian Charge d'Affaires,
superseding Sir Robert Hart as inspec
tor general* of the Chinese customs.
Russians have obtained control of
large tracts of land along the route of
the proposed new Chwang Railroad.

Special Cable to Tbe Call and the Nevr York Herald. Copyrighted, ISOB,
by James Gordon Bennett. â 
MADRID, Aug. 13. â There seems to De much division in the
..Carlists' ranks. Some of them, such as Olazabal, says: "We are
not going to fight."
I have just had a conversation with the most prominent Carl
i'st in Madrid. From his previous statement that nothing in this
. world could prevent them fighting, he has now departed to the ex
tent of saying: "If the Carlists do not fight at this juncture they
will never fight again.''
'-. â  "Does not your sentiment of patriotism prevent you causing
Spain the terrible disaster of another warP" I asked.
"On the contrary,'' he replied, cynically, "if we do not go forth
this time and save the honor of Spain; if we abandon her to the
. hands of those who have placed her in extremities we may con
y sider the Carlist party forever dead. It would be mere suicide.
... When will such another occasion ever present itselfP The Carlists
can dispose of many thousands of men and carry on a guerrilla war
'" fare until such time as the country comes over to its side.
"As regards the regular army, we are just in the same posi
tion as the insurgents were in Cuba, where 250,000 regulars could
not get the better of 8000 or 10,000 insurgents. If the Cubans
counted on the people of the island we Carlists count upon the sup
port of the whole north of Spain, part of Catalonia, Aragon la
Mancha and Old Castile. In short, you may state the Carlists are
ready to rise."

served the point of order (p. 72491. ami
it appearing to him that the deficiency
bill would be delayed by debate he in
sisted on his point of order (p. 7254),
which was sustained, and the railroad bill
was thus killed.
Senator White of California a few mo
ments later assured the Senate that no
debate (p. 7255) would follow If an
j amendment was agreed to which he
j would offer which had been agreed to by
j himself and colleague. Senator Perkins.
The bill as thus amended passed the
Senate by unanimous consent (p. 7255).
It could not pass in any other way.
The bill so passed came to the House.
As it came from the Senate I was op
posed to it. I saw Senators Perkins and
White and said the bill must be amend
!ed or I with many other Republicans
j would vote against it. While they did not
think my amendment necessary, yet they
said the Senate would accept the bill with
my amendment. Mr. Cannon of Illinois,
chairman on appropriations, had charge
of the bill In the House p. 74G5). and In
j order to get a vote in the House on my
I amendment it required unanimous con
, sent. I naturally sought Mr. Cannon
j first, but he declined to have it consid
i dered. and not until many members in
I the House and Senator Perkins and oth
ers had assured him of the certain defeat
of the bill unless my amendment was con
sented to did he yield and ask for unani
mous consent for a vote upon the bill
| with my amendment (pp. 7514, 7515).
The foregoing facts are necessary in
order that the matter be properly under
stood and considered.
In my judgment the bill settles the
question, and no further legislation is
necesssary.
As said by Senator Morgan: "Never
before has the Pacific Railroad question
been in such good shape. As it now
stands all necessity for further legisla
tion has passed." *i
The terms of the bill must be accepted
by the railroad or the mortgage will be
foreclosed. The bill provides for the pay
ment of all the principal and interest at
not less than 3 per centâ the whole
amount ($59,000,000) within ten years in
equal semi-annual installments. That in
the event of default in the payment of
either principal or interest or any part
thereof, then the whole sum and all in
stallments, principal and interest, shall
immediately become due and payable,
notwithstanding any other stipulation in
thr settlement.
The commission to effect this settlement !
is composed of the Secretary of the Treas- '
ury. the Secretary of the Interior and i
the Attorney General, and their acts must i
be approved by the President of the I nit
ed States.
I have full confidence in President Me- \
Kinley and his Secrt'tnrifs.
My amendment to the bill is as follows: i
"Provided, further. That unless the set
tlement herein authorized be perfected
within one year after the passage of this
act. the President of the T'nited States ;
shall at once proceed to foreclose all liens
now held by the T'nited States against
said railroad companies, and to collect '
the Indebtedness herein souerht to be set
tled, and nothing in this act contained
shall be held to waive or release any
ripht. lien or cause of action already held
by the Vnlted States."
Th<- terms of the settlement I believe to
be just and based upon common-spnse
and business principles. I have read Mr.
Maguire's speech as published August
10. The bill passed the Senate by unanl- i
mons consent, as above stated. Any one i
in the Senate could have killed the
amendment to the bill by Baying "I ob-
Ject**â this being a rule In the Senate at i
that stage of any bill.
In tho House, but for mv amendment,
the bill would have been defeated. Any
member of the House could have killed
my amendment by saying 1 "I object."
Mr. Mapuire ppnke against the bill as
it came from the Senate; but whpn unan
imous consent was asked to vote upon
the bill with my amendment, there was
no objection.
Mr. Magulre wa? present and might
have offered the objection. He or any
<"Â»ne else could have prevented the vote
being taken by simply saying "I object."
Mr. Mnguire did not, nor did ,mv one,
use these two words, which would have
defeated my amendment, and this would
have resulted in defeating the bill.
I have much confidence in the fidelity
of Mr. Maguire upon this subject: but.
for some reason, which he will doubtless
explain, he now makes vigorous objec
tion to my action, which he failed to
make when it would have been effective.
Everybody knew, at least everybod
who knew what was going on in th
House knew, that unless my amendmen
was adopted from twenty to twent>
five Rebuplicans would vote with m
against the bill.
Mr. Maguire says "That fÃarham's
vote alone lost us the vote of the wea
Republicans, who were looking to the Ca
ifornia Republicans for guidance in th
matter, and his iÃarham's) vote alon
cost us enough Republican support from
other States to make the passage of th
measure possible."
Mr. Maguire knew perfectly well tha
unless my amendment was consented to
that I would vote ngalnst the bill, and
there were at least twenty other Repub
licans* who would also have voted apainst
the bill, and it would have been defeated.
He will probably explain why he did' not
say "I object," find kill my amendment
and thus defeat the whole bill.
I think the bill, as perfected by my
amendment, was a Just, reasonable and
business-like disposition of the question.
I am somewhat surprised at one state
ment Mr. Maguire makes. . He says: "By
the acceptance of the terfns of the act
all of the collateral obligations of all of
these people to the Government would be
wiped out forever."
I know that in the excitement of a
speech, made under the circumstances
that Mr. liaguire made that speech, a
person Is sometimes led to say things
he would not deliberately say. Any one
who wtli read my amendment will Bee
at once that the statement above quoted
is not supported by the facts, for the
amendment on that subject expressly pro
vides, "Nothing In this act shall waive
or release any right, lien, or cause of ac
tion, already held by the T'nlted States."
I submitted my amendment, containing
the above quotation, to Mr. Maguire. and,
at his suggestion, the word "right."
which is found therein, was put In. The
sole, object of this part of the amend
ment was to save to the Government ;
all obligations held by it, and the act so i
expressly provides. If it does not save all â 
obligations to the Government It was his ,
fault as much as mine.
I think all rights, liens and causes of
action are preserved.
I am perfectly satisfied, upon the Â»ec
ord and the facts, to submit the matter ;
for the judgment of the people.

! TREATED TO A SURPRISE
HAVANA BATTERIES OPEN ON
THE BLOCKADERS.
; Before the Flagship Can Get Out of
Range a Shell From Sullen
Morro Tears a Hole
in Her Stern.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, Fla., Aug. 13.â The flag
ship San Francisco, the monitor Mian
tonomoh and the auxiliary yacht Silvia
were fired upon by the Havana batter
ies shortly before 5 o'clock yesterday
morning. One ten or twelve inch shell
struck the San Francisco's stern as she
turned to get away out of range, and
tore a hole about a foot in diameter,
completely wrecking Commodore How
ell's quarters and smashing his book
case into fragments. Nobody was in
jured, and, being under orders not to
attack the batteries, the ships retreat
ed as fast as their engines would carry
them.
The flagship and the Silvia lay par
allel to each other, not more than a
mile from Morro Castle, and separated
from each other by a distance of be
tween three-eighths and a quarter of a
mile. The Miantonomoh lay about
three-quarters of a mile to the rear of
the others. All were within range of
the Spanish batteries and the tempta
tion was too strong for the Spaniards
to resist. The first glimmer of dawn
was breaking through the eastern skies
when the lookout on the flagship saw a
jet of smoke puff from one of Morro's
big guns. Almost before he could pull
himself together sufficiently to make a
report of the incident ten and twelve
inch shells were screaming all around.
The Spaniards had the range and ap
parently were grimly in earnest in
their last efforts to wreak injury on
their too mighty enemy. Shells fell be
tween the San Francisco and the Sil
via: some fell short; a few went over
them. The flagship signaled the Silvia
to get out of range without delay, and
both ships swung around and made for
the sea.
It was then that the shell struck thÂ«
San Francisco's stern. Commodore
Howell was on deck with Captain
Leary when the shell struck. Witu
the utmost speed the fleet moved out
about three mile:;. Here the men on
the flagship patched up the ragged
hole in the vessel's stern.
All the shells fired at the vessel fell
around the ships. One of the Silvia's
men stood calmly on the deck of the
yacht, watch in hand, and counted
them. Morro Castle fired several of
the missiles, but how many is not
known. The others came from two
sand batteries near Morro.
The firing lasted twenty minutes.
The one-sided engagement had
scarcely ended when the men of the
Silvia were treated to another sur
prise. The little yacht gunboat is
manned by the New York naval militia.
Her crew had barely recovered from
the excitement when the flagship called
the vessel over and Captain Bellers
was given a packet of private docu
ments which he was ordered to take
into Havana under a flag of truce. The
white flag was hoisted over the Silvia
and she steamed toward the guns
which had just given her such a noisy
greeting. As the Silria approached to
within a mile of Morro the character
of the flag floating from her foremast
was discerned and the castle signaled:
"What Is your purpose?"
To this the Silvia answered:
"We have papers to deliver."
Morro did not resume the conversa
tion and for some little time the gun
boat rocked on the waters aim'bst under
the still smoking cannon of the enemy.
Presently, however, a Spanish gunboat
drew cut of the harbor and came close
to the Silvia. It was the Martin y
Pinzon and carried a much stronger
battery than the American ship.
The customary formal salutations
were exchanged and Lieutenant Wil
liam Q. Ford, the executive officer of
the Silvia, boarded the Pinzon and de
livered the documents. The ceremony
occupied no more time than the phy
picpl act involved. The American of
ficer returned to his ship and the ves
sels went on their respective ways.
REPORTED DEATH OF THE
SULTAN OF MOROCCO
Mulai Ab El Aziz Passes Away After
a H-eign of Fourteen
Years.
GIBRALTAR, Aug. 13.â 1t is reported
that the Sultan of Morocco is dead.
The Sultan Mulai Ab El Aziz, known
| to his subjects under the title of '"Emir
Al Mumenln," or "Prince of True Be
lievers," succeeded his father, Mulai
Hassan, on June 7, 1884. He was the
i fifteenth in the dynasty of the Alider,
'â  founded by Mulai Achaet, and the
j thirty-sixth lineal descendant of AH,
! uncle and son-in-law of the prophet.
Each Sultan of Morocco is supposed to
indicate the member of Sheriflan fam-
I HYi who, according to his conscien
tious belief, will replace him. This suc
cession is, however, elective, and all
! members of the Sheriflan family are
! eligible. Generally the deceased Sul
j tan's nominee is elected by public ac
' clamation at noonday prayers on the
I Friday after the Sultan's death, as the
] nominee is probably in possession of
the imperial treasure and is supported
by the black bodyguard from among
j whom the large majority of the court
I officials are selected.
WRECKED BY A BOLT
PLACED ON A TRACK
Freight Engine Goes Over an Em
bankment to the Beach Near
ElUcott Station.
WATSONVILLE, Aug. 13.â Freight
train No. 73 on the Santa Cruz division of
the Southern Pacific was wrecked this af
ternoon at 3:30 o'clock near Elllcott sta
tion, six miles from here. The engine was
hurled over an embankment to the
beach, fifty feet below. One freight car
telescoped the tende' . which remained
on the track, and another car was
wrecked. About 2W feet of track was bad
ly torn up. Jones, the engineer, and Har
ry Lewis, the fireman, Jumped from the
engine just before she flew over the em
bankment. Jones is severely bruised and
Lewis has his shoulder blade broken and
is probably injured internally.
The wreck was caused, it is believed, by
a good-sized bolt which had been placed
on the track. Suspicion rests on two
youngr men who had been evicted from a
passenger train shortly before. If a pas
senger train had struck this bolt on the
track the whole train would have gone
over the cliff into the bay.

PALMA ON THE
CUBAN SITUATION
Wants of the Islanders
Will Be Few.
STARVING NEED SUPPLIES
AMERICAN REFORMS TO BE
GIVEN HEARTY SUPPORT.
This Government Will Be Urged to
Cause the Liberation of Politi
cal Prisoners in Spanish
Dungeons.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Aug. 13.â The Times
this morning prints the following: Gen
eral Thomas Estrada Palma, delegate
at-large of the Cuban republic, talk
ing of the peace protocol and the steps
that would be taken by the Cuban
Government, said:
"The first thing to be done by the
Cuban patriots in America after the
blockade has been raised will be to
send relief to the surviving Cubans in
the field.
"Another thing that will be looked
after will be to try and Becure the re
lease of those Cubans who have been
deported from Cuba and sent to Span
ish penal settlements. I shall urge
that the Washington authorities Secure
the release of these prisoners.
"As far as the present government of
Cuba is concerned the leading men of
the republic, from President Masso
down, have implicit confidence in the
declaration that the United States
Government went to war, not for the
acquisition of Cuba, but to free the
island for the Cubans. It may be that
in years to come the Cubans may, of
their own volition, request this country
to annex Cuba, but that is not for the
present. Whether the present govern
ment of Cuba will be recognized now
Is no matter. The Cubans do not wish
to embarrass the "Washington authori
ties and have no doubt that whatever
is for the best will be done.
"But no matter in what way the
American Government goes about it, it
will always find the native Cubans not
only willing, but anxious to help the
Americans in the solution of the prob
lem."
PALMA SUSPENDS HOSTILITIES
Cuban Soldiers Ordered to Lay Down
Their Arms at Once.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.â Senor Pal

Bartolomo Masso, President Cuban Re
public, Santiago. Cuba: I have this 13th

States. You should give immediate or

pending hostilities. The preliminary
terms of peace signed by representatives
of Spain and the United States provide
that Spain will relinquish all claim over
and title to Cuba.

brains carrier. He is a Parnellite home
ruler, but he has always, it is said,
. i -ted a good deal with the Unionists,
and he is now throwing himself heart
and soul into the present contest. The
. division in the Nationalist ranks in the
corporation is not new. It has existed
for some. years and has been aggra
vated a good deal, by personal quarrels
over other matters altogether; and. if
r' the whole truth were told. I fancy that
? it would be seen that the proposal to
I elect a Tory Lord Mayor for next year
7 is but the latest development of what
? may be called the Pileite movement of
I the last half dozen* year.". To my
thinking, that proposal was not.a very
skillful device;, for it has led to the issue
being narrowed down to the question
whether Dublin Is 'to have a Tory or
a Nationalist for Lord Mayor next
year, and to that question there can
hardly be a doubt as to the reply
which, will be given. So clear is Sir
Robert Sexton himself as to the over
. .vh-elming strength of- Nationalism in
- this city that he is actually pretending
to have himself- a sympathy, with Na
tionalist aims and objects. The last
thing he has done is to express regret
that he missed being: in time to vote at
the last meeting of the corporation for
. a errant of a site for the monument to
: Wolfe Tone. But it is doubtful if he
has done himself any good whatever by
.'â¢- this device to catch Nationalist votes.
Many in hi? own party are anything
but pleased with it.
An obscure local body in the -County !
of Westmeath" has -this week lifted it- t
self into such prominence that It has {
â¢ been the -talk of the three kingdoms. It
has come about in this way: A week
or two since John P. Hayden, M. P. for ;
South Roscommon, made a speech in
- the House of Common? 6n the question
of the exclusion of the clergy of all de
nominations from the new local bodies
to be created under the local govern
ment bill. Mr. Hayden; though a Cath
olic . himself and a brother- of two
priests (both in the United States),
' spoke strongly and boldly In favor of}
â¢the exclusion. Mr. Harder., though the
representative of th.-- ..County of Ros

Parliament the Mulligan Board .â of. ]
Guardians, the great majority of which
are anti-Parnellites, determined to pun- I
ish the Parnellite newspaper proprietor j
and Parnellite U. P., who had the. cour- j
age to give candid utterance to his j
views at Westminster on an important
question of j? s ubllc policy. Two of th.' ]
majority give notice of a resolution
condemning as "vile and . anti-clerical"
the speech of Mr. Harden,' and express- I
ing toe intention to keep his reporters
out of the board room during the meet- \
ings of the board, and to deprive his
newspaper of the board's advertise
ments. It was a continuation of a per- >
secution to "which Mr.-HaydcA has been
subjected .for ten -or twelve years,: be- i
cause of a; difference of opinion between i
himself" and' the Bishop (Dr. ,Xulty) on
the question of -a water supply for the
town of Mulligan, and it was no doubt
thought a good stroke to seize the oc
casion presented by the Westminster I
speech to which I have referred for
bringing Mr. Harden to his knees. But
the too zealous advocates of the clergy '
in Mulligan overreached themselves. ,
In the first place, the resolution which i
the Mulligan board was to have passed i
in reference to Mr. Haj len "was voted
in th House of Lords on the very
evening when the question of admit- i
ting the clergy to the new councils was â¢
raised in that assembly in connection !
with the local government bill, with
the result that the Government, which
had been wavering on the point, stuck
to its guns and that the House. of Lords
supported it in keeping lit the clergy.
But this was not: all. The matter was
next brought before the House of Com- j
mons as a question of privilege. Every
one who spoke condemned the intoler
ant resolution of the- Mulligan board.
including Mr. Davitt, who, though an
anti-Painellite himself, denounced it j
sharply; and in the result it was voted ;
a breach of privilege, a plain intimation j
being at the same time given that if j
the resolution â :â¢- passed and acted |
upon its authors and those who voted
for it would be brought to the bar of
the House of Commons and Imprisoned j
in the Clock Tower. The sequel is a
miserable story of funk and retreat.
The day before yesterday, at a meeting
of the Mulligan board, the boycotting
resolution was withdrawn by its chief
promoter, who persisted in running
away, despite- all "sorts of taunts to
stand firm. It remains to be seen, how
ever, whether what was threatened
will not yet be accomplished. In the
meantime* most, persons of all politics |
(I fancy) are glad that Mr. Harden
has for the "time triumphed. He is
known to be a thoroughly honest poli- i
tician. In the days of coercion he was. j
though a very young man, four or five ;
times in prison for maintaining the lib- !
erty of the press, as well as the right of
the people, to combine against the land
lords. Apart from politics he is the ob
ject of the highest esteem and the
warmest regard to a large circle' of j
friends. His-- fellow journalists in Ire- j
land have given a marked proof of the j
opinion in which they hold him as a j
member of the journalistic . profession
by unanimously' electing him president \
of the Irish District of the Institute of
Journalists. There is no doubt that
John Hayden is a coming man.
Since I wrote a week ago the most
notable demonstration which has taken j
place in memory of the- "men of 'S3"
has been that-in-Carlow.. In thai town
a hundred years ago 640 "united Irish
men" were massacred in the streets,
while Just outside the town the man- |
gled and bleeding bodies were all i
buried together in one' huge grave j
which . was nicknamed "the Croppy I
Hole," "'croppies'- being the name given j
to the insurgents. ' Some - years ago |
the spot was inclosed: with a failing, j
and on Sunday there was erected with
in the inclosure a beautiful Celtic cross
in memory of the martyred dead. -The
assemblage on the occasion was an im
mense one, and all. the Nationalist par
ties sent representatives. It is need
less to add that the enthusiasm was
intense and that the speeches \tere
pretty outspoken deliverances. All this
w.as to be expected, especially in t Car
low, for the district, of which that town
was the center, was one of those which,
suffered most at the hands of the Brit
ish soldiers in black 'S3. Horror was
piled on horror there, first in inciting
to and then in putting down the in
surrection. Houses burned, brutal sol
diers living at free quarters, women
ravished and men murdered â are
the things about "98 which have im
pressed themselves ineffaceably on the
mind of every Catholic in the counties
of Kildare, Queens and Carlow. The
result is only natural. Nine-tenths of
the population of that whole district
would shake off the British yoke al
together to-day if they could, and that
is what it was Intended to express by
the meeting of Sunday last at "Croppy
Hole."
An Irish writer of really brilliant tal
i ents has Just passed away in the per
son of Richard Dowling. Twenty
seven or twenty-eight years ago I met
him first as a colleague in the Nation
office. He came from Waterford, from
which town also another writer in the
same office had come a short time be
fore in the person of Mr. Thomas Sex
ton, who afterward built up so great
a reputation for himself as a Parlia
mentary orator. Though they were
little more than boys at the time, they
were set by the late A. M. Sullivan
and his brother, Mr. T. D. Sullivan,
M. P.. to very important editorial
work; but Dov.line. being more-. of a
litterateur "than a politician and his in
clination for. humorous writing, being
very marked, he was soon made one of
{ the chief contributors to a humorous
weekly called Zozimus, which the
Messrs. Sullivan had just started in ad
; dition to their other papers. To Zo
i zimus he contributed a series of papers
that spilt the sides with laughter, and
; afterward constituted in their collected
form his first book under- the title of
"Babies and Ladders." After a few
years â¢ Richard Dov.line migrated to
I London, where he soon" became known
as one of the most promising novelists
of the day by his "Mystery of ,Killard"
â¢ and other books. .Unfortunately, his
\ health some time ago broke down, and
yesterday he died in hi? flfiy-rthir
! "at hip residence in Tooting before he
! had time to accomplish all that he was
i capable of in the field of literary -cre
ation. . I may, mention that, besides
< Dowling and Sexton, ;. Waterford, pro
i duced at about the same' time' another
i man of exceptional tajehts; .who was
; intimate with bothâ l mean Mr. Ed
i mond Leamy, ex-member of Parlia
ment, who is" not only a brilliant orator,
â  but a novelist and a poet of no mean
der as well.

here as to what will be now the prob
able course of the insurgents undei
Generals Garcia and Gomez.
General Garcia a few days ago oc
cupied Port Gibara on the north coast
of Cuba and is now moving on Hol

When asked to-night if the insur
gents would continue their active oper
ations in the field a distinguished of
ficial said to me that as the Spanish
forces would under the terms of the
protocol cease hostilities there would
be nobody for the insurgents to fight
and opposition to them would fall ol
its own weight. This official stated
moreover, that hr felt assured thai
General Shafter would immediatelj
upon the receipt of the cable dispatcl
sent him yesterday communicate
with both General Garcia and Genera.
â  Gomez and that he had no doubt both

""'Special Despatch .to The Call.
â¢SPOKANE. Aug. : 13.â 1n a few days
there will assemble in Spokane an ec
clesiastical court for the purpose of
trying "Rev. Dean Richmond Babbitt,
D.D*, LL.D., a scion of. the famous
Dean Richmond family of New York
and late dean of All Saints' Episcopal
Cathedra! of this city, the* see church
of the dfocese of Spokane, which in
cludes all of ': Eastern Washington. If
â he is convicted of 'the charges againbt
him the- canonical lams, provide- he shall
be stripped of his authority as a priest
of the Ep|scopal church, in other words,
*'urrfrbcked," f . Jvrj-lCf
Besides. befng 'a unusual thing
in the history of the Protestant Epis
copal church this particular- ecclesias
tical- trial will be- one of the concluding
chapters in a most sensational church
row that has j involved j the society peo
ple of Spokane, and -that in its ramifi
cations has brought in outsiders and
has stirred up interest. as far away as
the Atlantic coast. â ' ; =
Dr. Babbitt left a parish in Saginaw.
Mich., in 1592 to go to Tacoiha to as
sume the rectorship -of Trinity Church"
of that city, when Rev. Lemuel
H. .Wells, then â ; rector, was created
Bishop of Spokane. In *895 Bishop Wells
and - the chaptermen of All Saints'
â¢Cathedral brought Dr. Babbitt to Spo
kane as dean c-f the \ cathedral. Dr.
Babbitt has seen many parishes. In
addition he once was a lawyer, bo
when he came he had a contract with
the bishop and the chapter. This con
tract, he claims, gives him a life tenure
of the office of dean. And this is where
the trouble arose.
\bout a year ago, during the absence
of Bishop Wells at the Lambeth con
ference of, biihops .in England, the
-chapter claims, dissatisfied with the
c office of dean. And this is where
rouble arose.
out a year ago, during the absence
ish.-p Wella at the Lambeth
- iv England, the
â  came dissatisfied with the
course of the dean, who, it was
charged, was incurring bills Cor the
parish and conducting the finances in a
manner not to, the liking of those who
had to put' up the money. With the
bills he had incurred the opposition of
"some or the bankers on the chapter.
Recently he hati -taken up Christian
socialism* a-nd -was preaching much on
that line. Whatever the real reason
the chapter anyhow determined to get
rid of him and so announced it was
unable to pay his salary longer. He
declared if the chapter could not con
duct r the finances so as to pay his sal
ary; it was inc6mpetent and should re
sign. The chapter said he should re
sign;-and"' the i matter hirns" fire until
the Dish- returned.: :, - : . râ 
',. The bishop -investigated: an a determ
ined the "interests 'of the- parish de
manded that-:Dc. Babbit â¢ resign, -aqh
ing that conclusion after advising with
the full" standing committee and fol
lowing the advice* of that body. The
dean refused to- resign; He then was
removed from the position and ordered
to relinquish all. claims to the inship
by noon of October 15.. J557-,. This order
.was given 'on the evening of the 13th
of- October; That same, evening the
'cnaptermen determined' to prevent the
"stealing a march' on" them and to
â¢equip,;; the; cathedral with new locks.
! They, went there about midnight to
i carry out .their purpose. On arriving
they found the Rev. John Manning, the
dean's curate, in the study. Mr. Man
ning i ordered them,' out and they or
dered him out. -After, some parley Mr.
Brooke, Mr. Vincent and the other
"gentlemen rushed up the belf rey stairs
to the study, grabbed Mr. Manning and
carried him down, struggling and fight
ing, and deposited him in a hack. They
then took possession.
The following ' Sunday, October 13,
Dr. Babbitt sought to enter the cathe-
I dral, but was barred out by, the chap-
I termen. : Once after that he was denied
admission. The dean immediately
commenced holding services in a hall he
I hired for the purpose. Recently he se
| cured a church building by lease and
has started service* there, although the
| bishop en January 7 ordered him to
I cease preaching in Spokane.
X ;â¢â - comes the action of the bishop
in bringing "charges; to 'unfrock the
[ dean. First, it Is charged that the dean
[.violated the canons of the church in not
obeying' the order of "the bishop to re
linquish claim to the cathedral, that he
violated the canons also in attempting,
on October 17 last, to perform the func
tions, of. dean of the cathedral. '.":.'.
He is further accused of violating his
'ordination vows in not submitting him
self to the godly judgment of the bish
op by )ref using to obey the order to; re
frain from preaching in Spokane. > It la
o lso asserted ; that on Â£ December : 2\ he
took n way/ certain church property of
the cathedral, Including a piano; an'or
gap, eighteen desks and a number of
book?, all of which he has refused to
give' back to the bishop. :
Dean Babbitt's friends, assert- the
court -is at a complexion that is sure to
convict, but that so surely as it does
the matter will be taken to the house of
bishops and charges laid there against
Bishop Wells, looking to his dethrone
ment. â _____ -
CORPORAL POTTER A

His Family Thinks His Punishment
Is Deserved, but Speaks of His
Dash and Bravery.
NEW YORK. Aug. 13.â Corporal Ash
'tori Potter, -who is on his way to Hono

bers of his family although they think
his punishment was no more than he.

considerable attention.

Potter to-day, "that- the young man

his arrest, is a fine soldier and a-gen- :

of his action. The boy does 'not seem
to have d"on? anything 'malicious.. He
had a little too much energy; that was
all. He also had too much" money.
As to his boasting of his position, I
do not- think he could be guilty of such
behavior, for such a thing is entirely
foreign to his nature. . He was ex

Dies in Agony.
ftVNTA BARBARA. Aug. 13. -The four- '
ve^-old son of John Guebara died yeÂ»
terdav under suspicious circumstance*
The child, with two elder, brothers, went
to a Chinese vegetable garden this morn
ine A.fter they had played about the.
premises for some time the Chinese pro
prietor cut a musk melon into three parts
and gave one. to each of them. Immedi
ately after partaking of it one child wa?
attacked by violent pains and died within
te On m an U ce e xamination of the premises a .
bottle containing strychnine^ was â¢ found.
The Coroner's inquest brought out. many
suspicious facts, but guilt could not be
fastened upon any one. The elder broth
ers had eaten : of the melon and were not
affected at all. The piece from which
they had eaten contained a small hole,
but no evidence could be found to show
that it had been poisoned.

DEFEAT OF EDDIE BALD
â¢ . MeFABL AND WINS THE MILE
CHAMPIONSHIP.
.Western Wheelmen Easily Victorious
. ;â¢ in the Pursuit Race Against
the Crack Riders of
the East.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 13.â The
national meet of the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen was closed to-day, and
the racing was brilliant. It furnished
more surprises and more 'broken re
cords. Eddie Bald was beaten out in
the semi-final of the one-mile national
professional championship, as were
Tom Cooper and Arthur Gardiner. F.
A. McFarland, the new champion, won
in record-breaking time, lowering the
one-mile single paced competition mark
from 2:01 to 1:58 2-5. "Major" Taylor
wa's : but three inches behind in the
wonderful finish, and "Old Kaintuck"
Kimble but a tire's width back of the
"dark secret."
Frank L. Kraemer of Newark, N. J.,
l>ut a crimp into Peabody and won the
. one-mile national amateur champion
ship The winners of the first and
..second in the semi-finals were allowed
to start, and it gave a fast field. Krae
'. rner, however, had a world of speed
and he dealt it out freely. He crossed
the tape a full length in front of Earl
Peabody, the Chicagoan. The time
" was 2:04 3-5.
.. The two-mile amateur handicap
â â¢' event" saw another broken record, and
v Kraemer, the one-mile national cham
â  pion, registered it. Although he failed
.-â¢â¢ to finish within the money, he cut the
; .record to 4:17. *
The- third record to go to smithereens
' was that of a quad mile. In a trial
â against time, a team composed of Van
' Cott, Horton, Lishner and Bennett cut
.-.the record from 1:47 to 1:45 3-5.
â  .."In the two-mile tandem professional
â¢' race James Bowler was substituted for
Johnny Johnson, whose injuries re
â¢â¢ ceivedon the previous night were too
.-severe to permit of his riding. Plucky
"Plugger" Bill Martin was out steering
his mate, W. E. Mertens of Minneapo
â¢ 11s; and the pair won the event in
. 4:57 l-:Â», doing the last quarter in :24.
Martin all but fainted after finishing
and had to be carried from the track.
' The interstate pursuit race, teams
â â  entering from Illinois and Indiana in
.- tfve -West and Connecticut and New
'. â¢ York in the East, was won by New
' "V'Tk. The distance completed was six

r . the Easterners. Three of the Western
"team stayed to the finish. Stevens was

\ '"P.lugger" Bill Martin. It required
' only four and three-sixteenths miles

â¢ passing Martin, was 10:23 1-5.

HER MAJESTY'S SPEECH-
HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY, in proroguing
Parliament and dismissing her Lords and
Commons from further legislative service until
after the shooting season, has evidently desired to
start them on their holidays in a cheerful mood. As
far as was possible she spoke to them in what Ten
nyson called "large, divine and comfortable words,"
â¢ assuring them that their labors had been excellent
' and- that by their statesmanship the interests of her
people and her empire had been duly safeguarded.
Fortunately for her Majesty's reputation in the
world of high politics it is well known that she did
: not write her speech. The Ministers who conducted
the work of Parliament are the authors of the speech '
commending the work, and' upon them will devolve
the task of defending it against the severe criticisms :
:to which it is certain to be subjected. It is notorious
. that the interests of the empire have not been safe
guarded, and that even now they are in such a peril
ous condition that before the shooting season on the
moors is over the military men among the guests at
.' the hunting lodges may be called away to war.
As a matter of fact, despite its general cheeriulness,
the speech itself admits the threatening nature of the
â¢ situation. It asserts, indeed, that "relations with
other nations continue friendly," and that arrange
ments have been made with the Emperor of China
which c..c expected to "conduce to the maintenance
of. his independence and the security of his empire
and be favorable to the development of the extensive
commerce carried on between the pc les of Great
Britain and China." In another paragraph, however,
the Commons are thanked for their liberal appro- :
priations for the army and navy, and the heavy taxa- :
lion voted for imperial defense, and the significant
statement is made, "The sacrifices asked 01 you are
: severe, but no greater than the exigencies of the time i
require."
It is clear from the latter statement that the Minis
ters of her Majesty do not see plain sailing ahead,
nor are they facing the future with confidence in the i
â¢ continuance of peace. There are difficulties all around
them, and not the least ot these is that caused by the
growing uneasiness and discontent in Great Britain ;
'â¢ itself. Salisbury is now an old man, and with his
age there have come weakness and vacillation. Even
the members of his own party are doubtful of his
1 ability to deal with the crisis that has arisen in China'
â¢ and to cope successfully with the astute diplomats and
resolute statesmen who are directing at this juncture ,
the policies of Russia and Germany.
For a long time there has been in Great Britain a
clamor for a younger man to take charge of the for- '
eign affairs of the empire, but Salisbury holds on.
He is not willing to retire and give a free hand to the '
aspiring Chamberlain or to Balfour. Neither is the
country altogether willing to accept either of these
in his place. The cal? for a young and vigorous states
man remains unanswered simply because there is no '
one to answer it. The Lords and the Commons will,
therefore, go to their holidays this year in a dubious !
mood. They have done the best they could for their
empire. They have voted millions for defense, and
DOW it remains to be seen whether the Ministry can
make wise and effective use of the treasure and the
weapons that have been placed in their hands.
'â¢ The failure to permit General Lee to participate
in any action on Cuban soil is described as the sar
casm of fate, but highly critical people might view
it as fate having a political tinge.
. The Cubans are not so disgusted with the skua
-tion as to quit fighting, and considering that they no
longer have access to the American ration, they seem
- to be doing very well.
. Samuel A. Knight has knocked a dent into the
.* theory that Democrats never resign. But it may be
' said of Mr. Knight that he has established a
precedent.
"There is a possibility that the news of peace will
not reach Manila until after Merritt and Dewey have
manufactured a very satisfactory style of peace of
their own.
It is to be hoped the authorities will permit the
gentleman who requests the privilege of being buried
alive every privilege he seeks save that of being dug
up again.
One of the opponents of territorial extension is
the New York W arid. It has at least the excellent
â¢ excuse that the New York Journal is on the other
" side.
To be s'tc there is peace between us and Spain,
but it will be long before we love each other.
And another sad thing is that Bryan never smelled
oowder.
NO CAMPAIGN OF fIPOLOGY.
INDICATIONS that the present is to be a Repub
lican year arc so numerous that there is danger -they
may be misleading. The possibility of an over
confidence must be recognized by every shrewd ob
server. President McKinley, by his brilliant conduct
of the war to a successful issue, resulting in honorable
peace at die cost of little bloodshed, has- done much
to strengthen his party. Yet it does not follow that
at every point the party is invincible, nor that a weak
candidate can be elected.
The Republicans of California owe it to themselves
to put forward as candidate for Governor the best
man to be found. Whoever he may be he will be
opposed to a keen politician, an habitual office-holder
who is a demagogue of a plausible sort; who to Dem
ocrats is a Democrat and to Populists a Populist;
who knows every' trick of his calling, and to whom
must be conceded a strong personal following. A
weak candidate opposed to him, advanced because
this is a Republican year, will go down to defeat as
surely as the day of election shall come.
Therefore there is left to the Republican party only
one course. It must avail itself of the best material.
It must not be led into the selection of a candidate
whose political or private career cannot be exposed
to the fullest light. The chosen man must have a
clea*n record, from scrutiny of which nothing can be
dragged for his undoing. We cannot afford to enter
upon a campaign of apology and explanation.
There must be no doubtful transactions to be
cleared away. If the campaign cannot be one of ag
gression it will be one of disaster. If from the start
the Republican party shall be forced to make excuses,
to try to clear away doubts, to establish the character
of its chosen standard-bearer, to deny, to attempt to
refute, the endeavor will be useless and the end of it
defeat.
These are simple facts, appealing to the intelligence.
They cannot be combated, for "facts are stubborn
thing?."
(\ UNIQUE WAR.
JUDGED by any, or by every, phase of its course
from beginning to end, our three months' con
flict with Spain must be pronounced one of the
I most remarkable wars in the annals of history. It is
| unique in modern times. Only by returning to the
! records of the middle ages can anything like a paral
! lei be found to the contest, and even then there was
i none of a similar nature on anything like an equal
I scale of magnitude and importance.
During the whole conflict the Spaniards made
â  hardly a serious effort to uphold their cause or their
empire. They fought bravely enough indeed when
trapped at Manila and at Santiago, but even in those
instances the fighting was wild and badly directed.
One fleet we sought out in the Philippines and de
stroyed, and another they sent to the West Indies ap
parently for no other purpose than to have it de
stroyed: and that being duly done, they straightway
sue for peace.
If the Spanish authorities had provoked a war with
the United States with the sole object of getting rid
of Cuba without the humiliation of surrendering to
the Cuban insurgents they could hardly have acted
other than they did. They fought just about enough
to make a record of having a war with us. but no
more. The defense of Santiago imposed upon us one
hard battle, in which our losses were the heaviest we
ever suffered in a single fight with a foreign foe. but
with that exception we won victories as bloodless as
they were brilliant.
The strategy of the Spaniards was, moreover, as
extraordinary as their incapacity in battle. Why
should Cervera have been sent to the West Indies
instead of the Philippines? Why should he have
gone into Santia-go and stayed there until block
aded? Why should he then endeavor to escape in
stead of remaining to help Toral defend the town?
Why, after the fleet was gone, did Toral try to hold
the town which was then of no use to either him or
us? Why, when defense was no longer possible, did
he surrender over 20,000 men with all their arms in
stead of marching away to join Blanco at Havana?
These tactics utterly confused our military authori
ties, and led in several instances to sad mistakes on
the part of our commanding officers. Sampson was
twice. caught. First he supposed that Cervera would
try to break the blockade at Havana, and he there
fore remained there and sent Schley on a scouting
.expedition,' with tlie result that Schley had the credit
of chasing the Spaniards into Santiago. Then Samp
son concludedthat Cervera would stay in that harbor
until forced' out' by the capture of the town, so he
went away one day and lost the glory of commanding
the fleet on the day of battle and victory.
Miles was even more unfortunate than Sampson.
When the Santiago expedition was fitted ut Miles
was offered command, but he believed that expedi
tion would be but a small affair and that the great
event of the war would be the campaign against
Havana. He therefore scorned to command a sub
ordinate army and sent Shatter to take charge. Now,
after all, there, is to be no Havana campaign. Shafter
has done all the fighting and gained all the glory, and
General Miles has had to console himself with com
manding a junketing expedition to Porto Rico. Is
it to be wondered that he and Sampson despise the
Spaniards and regard their war tactics as beneath
contempt?
According to the philosophy now prevalent in the
world there is a reason for everything except the ver
dict of a petit jury- It may be assumed, therefore,
that some reason exists for the course the Spanish
Government has pursued. The discovery of that
reason will constitute the mystery story of historians
yet to be. but for this generation it will be accounted
a conundrum and given up.
No occasion for surprise exists in the circumstance
that Chinese admitted to the country on the pretext
of being exhibitors at the Omaha Exposition should
now be living in this. city. The exposition scheme
is a good one and does not seem to wear out.
Now that ex-Governor Hogg of Texas is here it
would be a good time to ask him whether or not he
really named his two daughters Ima and Ura. Per
haps the story was on-ly a campaign libel.
Evidently the new Farragut understands its busi
! ness. The torpedo-boat that failed to run into some
! thing and twist its, nose would not be in the same
} class with any vessel now afloat.
Aguinaldo was what may be termed too previous
in proclaiming himself dictator. He will be lucky if
so much as permitted to-be a private citizen of the
Philippines.
New York and Tennessee soldiers have had a little
fight, but naturally the boys did not wish to go home
without a sign of a scrap.
There seems to be no harm in .permitting Spain to
keep a few boats. She can't hurt anybody with them,
anyhow.
For some men to explain their position is easy; but
Maguire has so many of them.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 14, 1898.
WE have pointed out the lies of yellow'jour
nalism, in partnership with the bond-peddling
Cuban Junta, concerning the insurgent gov
ernment of that island. The war has exposed these
lies completely. It exposed the bond and blanket
mortgage conspiracy which incited those lies. It
has exposed the personal, financial interests of yel
low journalism in the bond-peddling conspiracy.
Cuba had no insurgent government, nor army, nor
treasury. The internal weakness and corruption of
Spain had permuted bands of predatory outlaws to
ravage the islands, while the Junta in New York,
with true Spanish instinct, set up a criminal specula
tion in a so-called "revolution," which was as much
entitled to belligerent rights or diplomatic recog
nition as its kindred industry of train robbing in the
United States. The President knew all this and
asked authority to do what Spain had failed to do, to
secure peace and order and stability of government
in the island. But the House wanted war and the
Senate wanted war and recognition of the insurgent
government, which had no existence to be recog
nized.
We succeeded in avoiding the folly of recognition
and declared war to expel Spain from the island.
This we have done by the shortest and sharpest war
in our history. We have made more history and un
made more geography with a less expenditure of
blood than appears in the martial record of any other
nation. We have put our army and our navy fore
most among the world's fighters by land and sea.
We have given heroes and heroic incidents to the
history of action at arms, and the chapter will make
men's nerves thrill and tingle through the ages. Now
at the end we are faced with the problem which
occupied the soldier-statesman in the White House
at the beginning. There is no Cuban ' government
and no Cuban army. The food we sent to the phan
tom of yellow journalism has been eaten and the am
munition has been used in murdering prisoners of
war and mutilating the bodies of the dead.
The President must now act on the declaration of
Congress that "the Cuban people are and ought to be
independent," and must secure to them stability of
government. The people, .being independent, must
choose and fashion the form of government that will
best maintain their independence and afford the most
stable protection to the rights of person and prop
erty. It is clearly disclosed that both will need pro
tection from the criminal rapacity of those pets of
yellow journalism, the so-called "patriots," whose
idea of independence is exemption from labor and
whose highest conception of liberty is freedom to
steal the property won by the industry of the thrifty
and orderly people.
The President having directed the war to a con
clusion; having so managed the friendship of Great
Britain as to protect us from a Continental alliance;
having convinced Spain that she would better treat
directly with us for terms, and having so humbled
her false pride that she conceded all of his conditions,
must now address himself to the greater task of
bringing order out of the Cuban chaos.
It may be expected that the yellow journals will try
to poke their long ringers into this question. We ex
pect torrid pronunciamentos from the Junta and
negro rhetoric from the San Domingan Gomez, and
a renewal &11 along the line of the issxte of recognition
of those unworthies. They still hug their blanket
mortgage and want to lay it like a blister of canthar
ides to draw the substance of the island from those
to whom it belongs, for the benefit of the crooked,
criminal and yellow journalism and the gilding of
their own pockets'. It is to be hoped that the coun
try will aid the President in following the line Of his
knowledge in the premises by founding a govern
ment oh something else than bandit raiders and bar
barous robbers.
AN UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION.
THE "sectional" political argument when once
introduced into State politics may be made to
produce some curious results. We trust our
esteemed Republican friends in Southern California
and Alameda County, since they are using this line
of argument for the promotion of their influence in
this campaign, will not take offense if we direct their
attention to a few facts in connection with it. Our
purpose, we may add, is to foster the general Re
publican welfare and not to make odious compari
sons or draw invidious distinctions.
At the election of 1896 Alameda County cast about
22,000 votes. At the present time the county is repre
sented in the State and National Government by a
United States Senator, a Superintendent of the Mint,
a Commissioner of Emigration, a Congressman, a
Supreme Justice and a member of the State Board
of Equalization. For the coming campaign the
county has presented two candidates for Governor, a
third who claims that he formerly resided within its
boundaries, and the usual number of aspirants for
minor offices.
The region south of Tehachapi comprises seven
counties: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Ber
nardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura. At
the election of 1806 they polled about 60,000 votes, or
less than one-fifth of the total vote of the State.
The region is not heavijy Republican. It gave Mc-
Kinley a little over 1000 plurality. In the present na
tional and State government Southern California has
a United States Senator, an Attorney General, a clerk
of the Supreme Court, and the usual quota of local
officials. It will present to the coming State con
vention candidates for Governor, Supreme Justice,
Attorney General, State Treasurer and clerk of the
Supreme Court. At the Legislature of 1809, if that
body happens to be Republican, it will present the
names of two candidates for United States Senator.
Southern California and Alameda County, it will
thus be seen, although casting less than 25 per cent
of the vote of the State, are in possession of nearly
all the offices. If they are given what their politi
cians ask for in this campaign and the people elect a
Republican administration. Southern California and
Alameda County will have actually captured "every
thing in sight." â  â¢
We do not know whether the politicians of these
regions have ever heard of it, but there is a city in
California called San Francisco. It cast at the last
election over 60,000 votes. Yet it has no Senator,
and it is represented in the State government only
by two Supreme Justices. We have not thus far in
this campaign heard anybody in Southern California
or Alameda County "mention" a San Francisco can
didate for any office. In fact, the silence in this re
spect is so oppressive that Mr. de Young has been
compelled to "mention" himself for Senator.
Would it not be a good idea for the politicians of
Southern California and Alameda County to consider
this city in connection with something? We defeated
the last Republican Governor over here, and but for
us Bryan would have carried the State. We are cer
tainly entitled to a poundkeeper, a rear porter, a tide
waiter or something.
Rea will probably find at Sacramento that even if
he can carry Santa Clara in his pocket there is not
room in that receptacle for the whole State.

Some people object to the title of this

Charles B. Hill writes to me a gentle

fours and a seven count twenty was

cation. I never assume to say any
thing about matters of such serious
Import, and couldn't tell a game of
cribbage from a sewing circle. Ac
cording to all mathematical rule, four
fours ought to count sixteen, and seven
more ought to make twenty-three. Ac
cording to Professor Hill, the total is
twenty-four. I don't see how he fig
ures it. But argument is useless. I
will give Professor Hill the address
of his adversary as soon as it can be'
ascertained, and am certain the pro
fessor will get the worst of it. There
is no wisdom in a mere scientist's burk

whose business is to know all that
anybody else knows and a great deal
that nobody else ever thought of.

Occasionally Governor Budd says
much in few words when he would be
wise to use more words and say less.
For instance, he wrote of the First
California after they had made a good
record under fire: "What else could
we expect? They are Californians."
It seems to me that they are also
Americans, and that this would have
been the better view to have taken.
The man who writes his own epitaph
is apt to make a mistake. There have
been : exceptions, as when Stevenson
penned the beautiful lines marking his
resting place, but Bismarck was no ex
ception. "A faithful German Servant
of the Emperor, William I." Such was
the word he left to be inscribed upon his
tomb. It is not a proud epitaph. Bis
marck -was great in life, but the ap
proach of death seems to have en
smaljed him. A life devoted to being
the faithful servant of any individual
would be in great measure wasted. I
move that the epitaph be revised to
read: "The faithful master of the

having devoured me, is quiescent, while
the Visalia poet is singing: low, I want

mitted, the attitude of the Examiner
being excuse enough, and its ridicu
lous efforts to stir up. discord, or make
people believe it has, supplying the pre
cise text. Now what is the Examiner
anyhow? A journalistic buffoon, jing
ling its bells and drawing attention to
itself by monkey antics, and having
caught the public eye and ear, not re
alizing that it is being hissed and
hooted, for it is not even an educated
monkey. It is a paper whose repre
sentatives were bounced from Cuba be
cause of the malign efforts to make
mischief there; whose opinions are
jeered and whose "news" is only beÂ«

the Examiner's efforts are being well
directed. But a drowning man has a
right to catch at straws, and with Ma
guire and the Examiner animals on
the Democratic raft the catching has
begun early. The Examiner wants the
public to accept its statement that the
leaders of the Republican party are at

The public has had its fill of gold

1 ready begun their shouts of disap
proval. No wonder there is a desire
to create the impression that the Re
publican party is split. Colonel Dan
Burns, whom I do not know and never
saw, is being- reproached for his silence.
The Examiner is doing this. In the
enforced absence of Hearst, Andy Law
rence is the Examiner. I recall hav
ing seen in public print statements con
cerning Andy, charging him with
blackmail and other crimes. It does
not appear to me that any antagonism
from this creature can do aught but
benefit that agafnst which it may be
directed. Colonel Burns is "silent."
That is, he does not summon Andy to
the 'phone and break into the confi
dence of that gentleman. He does not
resent the attacks, because mayhap he
has important things to do. I haven't
very important things to do myself,
and therefore undertake to throw these
few comments into the situation, as
everybody wants to contribute some
thing to the campaign. I believe the
Republicans will win, because they in
tend to unite on a good candidate, and
all the present discussion is directed to
ward finding out who this man may
be. It is an entirely proper and fra
ternal discussion, and the Examiner
cannot produce enough noise to dis
guise the fact, nor conceal that the
Democratic camp is the seat of broils.
Still, It will be admitted that Colonel
Burns is "silent." Ido not doubt that
in his silence he occasionally breaks
into a smile at the frantic exhibition
into which the Examiner has resolved
itself, all of It tending to Injure the
Popo-Demo outfit. When the Merry
Andrew can think of nothing better to
do than reiterate alleged remarks of
Colonel Burns concerning others high
in the party, remarks supposed to have
been made long ago, in all probability
never made, and of no public impor
tance if made, it strikes my humble
judgment that the Examiner needs an
editor of brains and character. How
ever, this is hardly worth mentioning.
It has needed such an editor for a long
time.

theory I have long entertained. This
man, judged by all standards, is crazy,
and yet he ought to be hanged with
out delay. Under the mysterious dis
pensations of Providence there are cer
tain Individuals fit for nothing else but
the scaffold. I believe that when a
man is mentally competent to plan a
crime and carry out the plan, he should
be punished for it, even if the fact is
established that his grandmother was
queer and an uncle on his father's side
once addicted to kleptomania. In fact,
I would favor the abolition of the plea
of insanity. When murderous intent
is unrestrained the practical result is
the same, whether the assassin is a lu
natic, a degenerate or a vulgar rob
ber. Hang them all, and get them out
of the way. The public is under no
obligation to keep them, and is doing
no good by doing so.
A distinguished local Journalist has
gone to the trouble of endeavoring to
show the general superiority of the
Spanish over the American and nations
of kindred blood. The first impulse
upon reading the fool stuff is, of course,
in the direction of anger, but to per
mit any such impulse to have sway
would be an error, and much to the
delight of the journalist in question,
who does not deserve any such tribute.
When Bierce, who is one of the strong
writers of the time, runs on with the

he does it deliberately and with the

Compliments to "A Subscriber" and
will she, he or it explain what it, he
or she may happen to be a subscriber
to? "A Subscriber" says: "Hew to
the line; let the chips fall where they
may." An excellent sentiment hereto
fore indorsed. I may not be an ex
pert in hewing to the line, but I think
the anonymous writer, who presumes
to send his, her or its counsel to a
newspaper is about as low a type of
the coward as ever appeared on the
human horizon to fulfill the mission of
being a horrible example. If there are
any chips about this, I hope some of
them will fall where they may attract
the attention of "A Subscriber" to the
fact that she, he or it is a feminine,
masculine or neuter ass. I had already
given warning that the anonymous
were unpopular with me, but the case
under consideration is not particularly
grievous, and so I use only mild and
pleasing terms this time. But a day
of wrath is coming.
"R. M. M." presents some original
thoughts in the Fresno Republican, but
I think he will excuse me for saying
that he is too flippant. His declara
tion that Christ, If on earth, would be
offered $25,000 to speak the Sermon on
the Mount into a phonograph, jars on
the nerves alike of the religious and
the worldly. The Sermon is one of the
grandest enrichments of literature and
morals.

To me the most pitiful feature of the
war has not been the deaths of some
I of the soldiers in oattle nor the hard
' ships suffered on a foreign field. At
' least the soldiers died while stimulated
and inspired by the thought that their
lives were being offered to their coun
try. As to the hardships undergone
i by the rest, these had been expected
| and were inevitable. But the young
j soldiers for months in camp here hdd
I a right to expect decent treatment from
1 the Government. They have not had
it. Unnecessary exposure has killed
many of them. The food has been
bad. The uniforms furnished have
I been shoddy. Unless observers have
j been led astray, some of the doctors
are' lncompetent and some of the nurses
unfit to give bran mash to an ailing
mule. People may theorize â¢ all they
want to about these facts and try to
Invent excuses for the, authorities, but
there can be no shadow of excuse. At
first there was a rush and confusion,
{ but passing weeks should have reme-
I died all this. it did not. There has
been neglect and cruelty, and the row
! of graves in the Presidio Cemetery haa
i been steadily growing, and each new
! mound is a silent and awful reproach
I to the army and the War Department.
j The brave lads sleeping there ought to
be still wearing the uniform of the
troops and ready to obey the call to
duty or go to their distant homes.
They are as truly martyrs as those who
perished at Santiago. To me their
I fate is the pitiful feature of the war.

on it inscribe: "Murdered by the Na

LADIES OF OLD CADIZ.

Oh, to Cadiz, with its ladies I will go.
And when our guns were booming,
With a p'ty quite consuming
I would fay, "Oh, charming ladies, pleaea

For although we humble Cadiz
We don't war against the ladies.
And the ladies of old Cadiz need not fear
the Yankee sword."

And so by easy stages
I would bring these fair hostages,
All these ladies of old Cadiz, far acrosg

SOLDIERS HAVE A FIGHT
The Tennesseeans and New
Yorkers "Come Together"
at the Presidio.
Although some of the officers of the
First New York and First Tennessee are
disposed to make light of the "scrim
mage" between the men of these regi
ments Friday night, It might have been
a serious affair.
It seems that for some little time there
has been existing between the New York-
ers and the Tennesseeans considerable ill
feeling, so the story goes, and on Friday
night It culminated in a fight, the result
df a joke that originated with the Kan
sas Regiment. Some of the Kansans,
with their haversacks turned Inside out
And placed over their heads, paid a visit
in this disguise to thÂ« Tennesseeans, who
after recovering from the surprise took
up the joke and made a similar raid on
the Fifty-first lowa, and then on the New
y<Â»rk men.
At the hands of the New Yorkers, how
ever, they met with a hot reception. Their
visit was by no means considered a joke,
and soon there was a free fight, the wea
pons being bare fists. The result was sev
eral black eyes, scratched faces, and
bruised noses. The excitement ran high
tor a time and it was with considerable
difficulty that the disturbance was finally
Duelled. It was necessary to- call on other
troops to put a stop to the battle. It is
raid that thi.s affair h.-is greatly intensi
fied the feeling between the Tennessee
men and the New Yorkers.
A statement received from the Presidio,
however, says that "the soldier were out
for fun and made a good deal of noise,
and wanteil to ex! end the fun indefinitely.
As the crowd was a large one. the guard
was turned out to separate the soldi. -rs
and get them back to th>-ir camps, mere
were no collisions whatever, and no
troops of cavalry were called out to dls

Some of Davis' friends claim that frauds

NOT A SURPRISE TO PARDEE
OAKLAND, Aug. 13. â After the appearance of the campaign dur-

of the Alameda County Repub
licans for Governor.
; large to make the claim of little value so
far as results are concerned, In the out-
Bide <iisl ruts Davis made a better show-
Ing, in some precincts even getting a ma
jority, though not as large as he had
been'led to expect. ,
The support Of the railroad is sufficient
ly shown by the vote. In the strongest
railroad precincts Pardee has a majority
over Davis of anywhere from three to
seven to one. In the outlying districts
Davis ran more even.
It is claimed that Pardee s county com
mittee scored a point w^n arranging for
the primary by fixing the hours from S
a m. to fp. m. At the time an effort
was made to change th"m from 1 a. m.
to 7 P. m., but it was voted down, and
the reason Is now apparent. Many Re
publicans, whose business interests are in
Han Francisco, BO to the city on the four
trains leaving Net ween 7 and 8 a. m
These men naturally deferred voting until
after their return home, the polls being
open until X o'clock, when if they had
opened an hour earlier they would have
voted before crossing the bay. The result
was that when some of the commuters
went to the polls this evening they found
that their names had been voted.
In the Fourth Ward there was con
siderable dissatisfaction among the Par
dee crowd over the delegates their chief
had put up for them to vote for, but the
grumblers were in the minority, and the
ticket was elected.
In Alameda the unpledged ticket, so
clevcrlv captured by Pardee, went
through with a rush, and while the Dem
ocrats a* a rule helped it along, there
was little or none of the rough work that
niarked the election in Oakland.
The right between Pardee an* Davis had
become so bitter in Alame-da that many
Republicans had made up their minds
not to support either candidate. Pardee
turned this sentiment to his own advan
tage with astonishing results. His friends
got out a third ticket marked at the top
In bold letters, "Independent " and vot
ers were told that the names thereon were
In truth independent, when, in fact,
every one of Pardee's delegates was
OI To-n!ght there If a great crowd parad
ing the streets, shouting for Pardee and
shTittering the nerves of all peaceable cit
izens.

ingr the last ten days I cannot say
that the vote of to-day was muchof
a surprise to me. It is very evident
that the Republicans of Alameda
County desire a united delegation to
the State convention, and this pr<>b
ably. In part, helped in the decisive
result. There can be no doubt that
a solid delegation from Alameda
County elected by such large ma
jorities must have a marked influ
ence for good on a State convention.
If Alameda deserves the nomination
for Governor no one can now doubt
that the party in this county has a
candidate and no one can say that
sentiment is divided. I cannot but
feel gratified and honored by the
result. â¢

BROUGHT A SPANISH
VESSEL'S FIGUREHEAD
CITY OF SYDNEY ARRIVES
WITH A WAR RELIC.
The Ornament From the Don Ulloa
Was Sent by the Raleig-h to the
Navai Academy.
The transport City of Sydney reached
port last evening, having made the run
from Manila in 24 days 7 hours and 25
minutes. The return trip was as un
eventful as the voyage over, and no one
but the crew returned with the vessel.
Captain Pillsbury. the commander of
the vessel, has in his charge the figure
head of the destroyed Spanish cruiser
Don Antonio de Ulloa. It was sent over
by Captain Coghlin of the Raleigh, and
is to be presented to the Naval Aca
demy at Annapolis.
The crew of the City of Sydney report
thut the voyage to Manila was an ex
tremely pleasant one and was enjoyed
by the volunteers. There was a band
concert every evening and with the Im
promptu entertainments the trip was
more like a pleasure cruise than a ser
ious undertaking.
When the vessels arrived In Manila
{he troopships had been expected for
over two weeks, and the soldiers were
immediately disembarked and put to
work throwing up intrenchments in
front of the city. The boys were given
a great reception and their arrival was
almost an ovation. The Baltimore had
been sent out to escort the transports
into the harbor and met them some dis
tance out.
The City of Peking, it is believed, will
be held in Manila, but the other trans
ports are to be sent back in short or
der. The story of a fire in the coal
bunkers of one of the transports is de
nied by those aboard the Sydney.

WARM TIMES
AHEAD FOR
McNAB MEN
Alameda Delegates to
Give Them Battle.
THEY WANT FAIR PLAY
RENEW-fiD OBJECTIONS AGAINST
THE APPOINTIVE PLAN.
The Democrats of Aiameda Believe in
Electing State Delegates at
Primaries When
Possible.
OAKLAND. Aug. 13.â Ihe Alford-
Gould-McNab Democratic conspirators
will ftnd when the State convention meets
at Sacramento next Tuesday that their
plan for depriving the San Francisco
Democrats of their rights does not meet
with favor In Alameda County. The dele
gates from Alameda County will protest
against seating the delegates who were
appointed by the Committee of One
Hunderd, and the vote that will be cast
to unseat the appointed delegates will be
given toward seating the contenting Har
neyites.
The Alameda County delegation met in
Icutive session to-night to discuss con
ition affairs. Among those present
re: M. J. Laymance, H. C. McPlke,
E. Dalton. T. C. Stoddard, William B.
lte, "Warren English and F. W. Vooght,
o Is also president of the Bimetallic
igue. Many of the delegates who
through press of other business were un
able to attend the meeting, sent word
that they were unalterably opposed to any
Item of appointing delegates instead of
ting them at primaries. There was
inanlmlty of opinion concerning the
political taste -shown by thÂ» Demo
tic conspirators, who denied to the
nocrats of Sun Francisco the right of
ressing by their votes at the polls
>m they wanted to represent them in
State convention.
The lead taken by Alameda County in
fighting against the Alford-Gould-McNab
combine will undoubtedly be followed to
other counties, and turn- is every Indica
tion that there is a stormy time ahead
for the trio of political conspirators when
they reach Sacramento.
The members who attended the meet-
Ing to-night were all outspoken in their
denunciation or' the methods adopted by
the trio of would-be Democratic bosses.
They recognized tne fact that the tactics
adopted by the Committee of One Hundred
moan a loss of many hundred votes in
San Francisco unless local affairs there
are straightened out.
It is with the intention of trying to
solve the Democratic political problem in
Francisco that the Alameda dele
gates will light to see that both contest
ing delegations are given a fair hearing
and a just decision. That the high-hand
ed proceedings of the Committee of One
Hundred will be given a thorough inves
tigation is certain, it is equally certain
that the Alameda delegation will place
their stamp of disapproval on the ap
pointive scheme of the irio.
The Alameda delegates are united on
the question of the chairman of the dele
gation. It will go to M. F. Tarpey.
Several of the Alameda delegation in
tend leaving for Sacramento to-morrow
night to establish headquarters.
The feeling against allowing the ap
pointed delegates to take seats in the con
vention Is steadily growing in this coun
ty, as is well evidenced by the following
Interviews had yesterday with del
who had not been previously spoken to
on the subject:
Kx-Congressman Warren B. English
.â¢ a loss to Bnd words to express his
condemnation of the Â«ag methods of the
Committee of One Hundred. "It Is the
outrageous proceedin*" ever perpe
trated," declared Mr. English. "It is un
democratic and in direct violation of ev
ery principle of the party. Adopted by
both parties and followed to a logical
isfon it would mean the utter de
basement and enslavery of the whole peo
"The fundamental principle of Democ
racy is to get as close to the peopl â â¢â¢ art
possible, :ir.O while the primary system
does not always accomplish that en 1, it
cornea the nearest to it of any plan yet
devised, f'mlt-r the machinations of lh*Â»
Oould-Alford-McNab combination every
Democrat in San Francisco is disfran
chised and the largest single delegation
in the State given completely into the
control of those men. It is an outrage
that will be condemned by every honest
rnun in the party.
"I shall certainly flght against the seat
ing of that delegation to the last, and I
think that every delegate from Ala
meda County wi'l do the same, for I. with'
the others, believe the very existence of
the Democratic party depends upon the
overthrow of this self-constituted body.
Its recognition by the convention would
be the greatest calamity that could be
fall the party, and every man who has
the lear.t regard for clean politics will be
found arrayed against the McNab out-
C. W. Logan is another of the Alameda
delegates on the side of clean politics.
"I am not familiar with the situation In
San Francisco." said Mr. Logan," and
until I am I cannot say what action 1
will take in regard to unseating those
tea. There may be some unusual
circumstances that necessitated the ap
pointment of the delegates Instead of
holding regular primaries, but they would
to be most unusual to admit of
countenancing them. 1 am, of course, in
favor of pure politics and if I am con
vinced that the action of the committee
of 100 is unwarranted 1 shall not hesitate
t â¢ vote for the unseating of the San Fran
cisco delegation."
Patrick Mullan, delegate fro-rn the Sixth
Ward, knew nothing whatever oi the sit
uation in San Francisco, and, therefore,
had no opinion to express. He said the
i roper place to pass judgment on the
Mi Nat) delegation was in convention and
he would hear both sides before he com
niitted himself.
C D. O'Gara of the Sixth Ward wa
unable on account of business reason
last night to attend the meeting of Dem
ocratic delegates, who are determined t
I at the McNab faction at Sacramento
he is stronger than ever In his d
latlon of the appointive method o
ting delegates,
he whole method was wrong from
beginning," said Delegate O'Gar
it is one of the Instruments whic
i to the ruin and destruction of
f. God knows we're bad enough o
is, and politics has been corruptei
so much in San Francisco that this cc
tainly does not help it any.
"I "am sorry I could not attend th
meeting to-night, but I shall have
voice in the convention. I do not believe,
in one or fifty men ruling three or four
thousand voters. It 1Â» wrong from be
ginning to end. Half those appointed
delegates from San Francisco will not a
tend the convention, and some manlpu
lator will hold their proxies. 1 tell yo
It Is detrimental to the Democratic part
and is a method that will give the Me
Nab faction ample opportunity to pc
petuate itself."
Daniel Madden, a delegate elected from
Berkeley, has been a democrat all h
life, but" ho does not regard' the action o
the Alford-Gould-McNab faction as be
ing born of true Democratic principles.
"I have been a Democrat all my life
said Mr. Madden to-uay, "and ns a Dem
ocrat I am thoroughly opposed to an
such ring in county management as th
McNab-Gould committee In San Frai
Cisco. I always believed and win beiie-^
that politics is for the people in genera
and not for the .tosses, who try to ru
things in their own way." He decline
to state whether <>r not he would vot
for the unseating of the appointed dele
fates. "I hope, however," continued M
tadden, "mat the chairmanship of th
convention will not fall to a member o
thai section of the party â in which cas
I feel confident the principle of electin
delegates by primaries will not bo los
sight of."
James O'Nell. another State delegat
from Berkeley, who is regarded as a lea<
tir in his party's politics In the universal
town, was also seen to-day and said:
"I am surely opposed to the appointin
of delegates as a matter of principle, and i
I felt very much dissatisfied with the no
tion of the San Francisco Democrats. At j
the State Democratic convention, I assure
you, I will vote against seating del* â¢
appointed by a ring of politicians."
John E. Hennett. the third delegate
from Berkeley, is still another who does
not approve of the appointive method.
"I have not given the subject a great
deal of thought as yet." said Delegate
Bennett this afternoon, "but while I be
lieve in Magnire'a election as essential
to the political and economical welfare
of the State, and while 1 firmly believe
that politics should express the will of
the people to the largest extent. I can
clearly see where exceptional measures
are sometimes called for, and in such ,i
case the appointment of delegates might
even be justifiable.
"As a matter of principle, however. I
am in favor of democracy, being carried
as far as possible when the paramount
aim is to obtain thf honest and sincere
expression of the wishes of the people."
LOS ANGELES PRECINCT
LOSES A BALLOT BOX
INCIDENT OF THE REPUBLI
CAN PRIMARIES.
Ruffianly Gang Enters a Polling
Place and Seizes the Votes.
Outcome of a Quarrel Se
tween Candidates.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 13.â The Repub
lican primaries held throughout the
county to-day for the purpose of electing
delegates to the State convention, passed
off according to programme, except in
the Second Precinct of the Seventy-fifth
Assembly District, where an opposition
ticket was put in the field by L.. E. Doan.
who for personal reasons was opposed to
J. R. Newbury, one of the caucus nom
inees on the regular ticket. Doan. how
ever, failed in his attempt, and the regu
lar ticket was elected without a break.
This, however, did notcnd the matter,
for when the polls closed, and before the
ballots had been counted, a gang from
the Eighth Ward, headed by J. J. Grif
fith, a notorious character and member
of the Flambeau Club, commonly desig
nated the "Flimflam Club," entered the
polling place, and after a struggle, dur
ing which the ballots were scattered on
the floor, succeeded In capturing thf* box
and making way with it. Whether the
act was done at the instigation of Doan
is not known at this time. The matter
will, however, be thoroughly Investigated
by the authorities, who will have the as
sistance of the Republican organisations
in prosecuting the guilty parties to the
fullest extent of the law.
As the trouble grew out of a personal
difference between Newbury and Doan,
no reflection is cast on the party con
ducting the primaries. The leader of the
gang. J. J. Griffith, was arrested by Sher
iff Burr late this evening, and the other
members thereof being known will un
doubtedly be placed behind the bars be
fore morning.
ThÂ«-> dastardly affair has created the
most Intense feeling here, and Dem<
as well as Republicans will do all in ...eir
power to bnak up the notorious gang
which is said to be made up of the low
est and most depraved characters in the
city. They have been a menace to re
spectable voters for years, and nothing
will be left undone to wipe them out for
got ill.
So far the contest for Governor has
overshadowed all other Interests and now
that the election of delegates to the State
Convention has been held and the <;..ue
forces know that they control the delega
tion as a unit, some attention will be given
to the Legislative ticket during the com
ing week.
J. C. N't dham. a prominent attorney of
Modesto . { nd A. J. Pillsbury, editor of the

BREACH IS
WIDENING IN
SANTA CLARA
County May Be Lost
to Republicans.
BITTER FIGHT AGAINST REA
HONEST PARTY MEN TALK OF
TWO TICKETS.
Will Repudiate the Rscent Primaries
and Contest the Seats of the
"Bo^is" Gang in the
State Convention.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Aug. 13.â A wedge was
driven Into the split in the ranks of the
Santa Clara County Republicans to
day, and th?~ c is no show of the chasm
being bridged before the fall election.
This probably means the loss of the
county to the Republican party and
may play an important part in the
election of Governor. It is the dis
reputable tactics of "Boss" Rea and his
followers that have caused the erup
tion in the party. So rank was the
work of his ballot-box stuffers and
heelers at Wednesday's primaries that
the better class of voters have rebelled,
and there will probably be two county
tickets "f Republicans in the field.
As the beginning of a determined
; fight against the Rea Kan- two Etc-
I publican conventions convened in this
city to-day. The delegates nominated
by the Good Government League met
â in Rutherford Hal! and organized
; temporarily by electing J. K. Johns
chairman and B. W. Conant secretary.
| Pending an appeal to the State con
; vention they adjourned to August 27.
I They will repudiate the recent pri
; maries and contest the right of the
Rea men to hold a county convention.
a delegation will also be sent to Sac
; ramento to contest the seats of â  lie
gang's delegates. This convention was
orderly, quiet and determined arid was
ruled by the wish ot the majority.
The meeting of the Rea force? in
Turn Verein Hall was different. Here
the dictates of the "Boss" were plainly
'seen. The Mackenzies were present,
land, with the aid of their followers.
the county tick, t published in this
morning's Call went through with but
one change, that in the constableship.
There was no bucking among 1 the dele
gates, and the will of Rea d >minated.
The convention contained a larjre
: number of Democrats. With or â¢ â¢ *.
ception the nominations were all made
by acclamation. Nev r did things go
smoother at a convention, and thu
. of the boss could readily i>Â» seen.
Rea strode about the hall with an "I
told you so" look upon his face.
The ticket nominated to-day is dis
tasteful to a large number of Repub
licans, and it is doubtful if it caa win.
Black for Superior Judge and Langford
for Sheriff are put up as dummies and
â  will l>e â¢'knifed" by the gang for V. \.
Scheller and George Bolllnger, probable
j Democratic nominees for those posi
tions. Other candidates will be tnded
to help gang Democrats. It is thÂ°se
tactic? of Rea that is ruining the pirtv
i and driving honest Republicans fr<>m
; the ranks.

AGUINALDO WAS
BUT A PUPPET IN
GERMAN HANDS
Urged by the Kaiser's Officers
to Attempt Treachery to
Admiral Dewey,
. 'Special Correspondence of The Call.
â 'â  CAVITE ARSENAL, July 9.-rThis
; quaint old port, the most important
â¢prize to Admiral Dewey's prowess, is
in full possession of the first American
expeditionary army under General An
derson. We are waiting, as near
ly as I can gather, for the second
expedition! How soon that will come
no man knows, but its arrival is looked
' for daily.. The insurgents, under Gen
era! Aguinaldo, are not aiting â or at
all events say they are net. I had it
to-day from an officer of the staff
tk the "Dictator of the Republic of
Philippines," for so my cables will have
informed you he has proclaimed him
that the Insurgents are being con
centrated for a general assault on the
.sh lines of defense to-morrow.
As they do most of their fighting at
night that means an assault at, say 4
lock Sunday morning.
Admiral Dewey would stop it,
as he could easily enough, if he
believed there was danger of success.
The truth Of the matter is Aguinaldo
has been playing fast and loose with
the Americans, and. he has been and is
being abetted in this by the Germans.
.Their purposeâ the purpose of the
Germans â in this is plain. They would
..desire nothing better than for the in
surgents to take and loot Manila in
. order that the inability of a small force
of Americans to protect lives and prop
t-ny in the town, and in order that the
necessity for foreign Intervention
= might become apparent. I do not be
. â¢ lieye the Americans here would be
found wanting, nor do 1 believe, as 1
. said before, thai Dewey would fail any
more than he failed at Cavite to up
hold law and order. General Anderson
and the admiral buth understand their
business. They will keep order, and if
the second American expedition
reaches here with the .Monterey before
the Spanish fleet gets in from Cadiz.
Manila will be taken in good time.
Spaniards would surrender now if
ral Anderson would take the re-
Bponsibility of protecting them.
There have been a number of parties
out on the lines to reconnoiter the in
surgent position. I have been out sev
eral times, but haw seen little more
yet than desultory righting. The in
surgents are most hospitable. They in
-Mall eat with them when
â¢ ever you stop at a house, and every
thing they have is at your disposition.
Their intrenchments are peculiarly
: matted bamboo, about
I high, four feet wide at the
hi feet at the base, and filled
'with sand. *>n the interior side about
four feet from the top is a narrow fir
. ing platform. These they build as they
ace, and they advance steadily
day by day. Their outposts under Gen
eral Moreal at Pasoy, according to the
â  map. is about three miles from Manila.
The righting takes place, as I have
said, for the most part at night. At
about 4 a. m. you hear heavy cannon
n there will be the sharp
. "pit! pit!" of Mausers. Then you will
â¢know there has been some sign of life
. by the Spaniards behind an in
surgeht barricade, and that the whole
along the iine has opened fire.
There may have been an insurgent
:. and there may not. But you can
rest assured that if a Spaniard has
emptied his rifle magazine an insurgent
has rushed forward and cut one man
down with his machete. The advance
of the Filipinos is made as the advance
'of a covey of quail is. One will rise up
quickly from the long, lush, tropical
S, giving the Spaniards a target.
:. the whole volley will be poured
: up.*>u him as be drops, the shots going
over â  As the shots whistle
past the Filipinos will all rise, rushing
forward and shooting as they run.
If they reach the Spaniards there is a
slaughter by the long machetes. How
deadly this may be is shown by repoits
.st night's battle. It is said that
jLOpb Spaniards were killed, and 25 Filip-
Jf the rush does not reach the
Spanish lines there is another volley
and another drop. It is by these tactics
the Filipinos have advanced and so ter
rified the Spaniards that little can be
against them.
The California boys keep in bet
, ter health than the Oregon regi
ment. There is little sickness,
.and none of it serious. For the
most part it is a diarrhea caused by bad
water and fresh fruit. But the Califor
nia boys have been given less liberty
than the Oregoniana, Their officers do
no| permit the men to frequent the
town very much, and men who stay
i.ut of the town do not get into serious
tro-Ã¼ble. There will be no serious fight
ing until the next expedition arrives,
and even then, as 1 said before, there
will be no fight put up by the Spanish.
It is the pacification of the insurgents
that will give the boys trouble hero.
The Filipinos, however you may
despise him for his small stature ]
. and bad blood, will fight, and fight
hard. Also he will live and thrive
where pestilence will kill the heavier
American, whom he looks up to with
awe and calls "Un grande soldado."
By the way. I forgot to say that a lot

WITH THE EXPEDITIONARY
FORCE AT FORT SAINT FRANCIS.
Cavlte, July 7.â To-day news as late as
July 1 has reached us from the outside
world. Everything is in statu quo.
Stores are still being landed and sen
eral policing of the arsenal continues
unabated in energy. The quarters are
gradually presenting a cleanly appear
ance, and drains are being built to car
ry off surplus "water. The rainfall is
heavy, although without wind or much
change in temperature. The men are
experiencing certain The rainfall
although without wind or much
in temperature. The men are
ncing certain difluulties which
change of climate has brought about.
In the Second Oregon Regiment at sick
call this morning a long line of men
was waiting for treatment. The pre
vailing trouble is diarrhoea, which may
turn into dysentery unless properly
treated. There is also a peculiar fever
without any attendant symptoms be
yond a very high temperature, some of
the patients reaching 104 degrees, with
a strong bounding pulse. This is treat
ed medicinally, but the best remedy
found so far has been continual spong
ing with cool water. "With each abdom
inal bandage the Red Cross Society is
sued a small circular setting forth that
mangos might be eaten with impunity.
The harm that this advice has done
may easily be guessed when we can
see the results of mango eating in a
fever called In Hongkong "mango fe
ver," and by the eruptions and boils
on the men caused by the same fruit.
The number of men sick are few. com
paratively, but there might be less had
It not been for the advice of a physi
cian, who parts his name and hair in
the middle. Any native will tell you
that mangos bring boils and eruptions
and that until a foreigner has been
here three months or more and thor
oughly acclimated he must not touch
this fruit.
The native Filipino is much a Malay
a good deal a Chinese and more of a
Jap, with more or less Spanish mean
ness thrown in. After seeing the many
really beautiful Hawaiian men and
women and being suddenly thrown into
contact with the Filipinos, the com
parison is odious. The mestizo is
small, lithe and muscular; he is flat
faced and bullet-headed. None of the
women are even good looking. They
have very expressive eyes, and the
younger ones have good white teeth,
and that's all. There are no fat people
here. It is amusing to see the Filipi
nos when they are at rest, squatted on
their heels, chewing beetle nut- . The
older women are given over" to this
habit entirely, and they have ugly
black teeth as a result.
The towns of Cavite, Carrido, ; old
Cavite and San Rogue ' are in
proximity to Cavite itself. They are
laid out in blocks, same as our Ameri
can cities, with but narrow alleys as
streets. They are ill smeillag and ex

been taught that cleanliness is next
to godliness. Whenever any one has

quartered there is an a-icient and "Mi
t'.'i-ly obsolete system < f plumbing,
much out of repair; still better than
none at all.

j sons and wife and four daughters. Th?

whom no more courteous gentleman

breakfast was prepared in the officers'

the pleasure of conversing with the oH

plained that the insurgent officer in

room on one of his "cascos," as they
call the native boat. One of the young
| ladies showed me the marks on her
arms when* she had fallen on : a shindy
road, shoved by the guard when she
stopped to tie a refractory slipper.
Colonel Summers tried hard to do
something to alleviate the misfortune
of these innocents, but the lieutenant
in charge was obdurate and th poor
woman had to trudge along in the rear
of the long column of prisoners. It 1 was
a heart-breaking sight;
There are not many Illiterates in this
! community; nearly all the natives can
read. They are shrewd and cunning
and have enough of the Spanish in
them to be unreliable. They are boast
ful to a degree, and have a . certain
amount of romance in their make-up
that makes them moat interesting.- r-\.

American outposts, in the midst of
bamboo forests, in the thatched hut of
these measly, scrawny natives, I have
found the pianos, fine mirrors and the
carved walnut bedsteads that Ameri
can curio seekers would give hundreds
for. With an intense hatred of the
priests the native looted his church
and imprisoned the priest or shot him,
but still clings to the old faith. You

"Skirmishing goes on daily between
Aguinaldo and â  the Spaniards, and
Spanish prisoners are continually
arriving. This is not brought about
by .reason .., of. brilliant, feats , of
arms, but more :by reason of
hunger. Since Dewey interfered with
Aguinaldo in behalf of better food the
Spaniards have been faring better. than
ever they did in their own", army. At
5 ...oclock I. can , hear desultory firing
going on in the town. . Aguinaldo is be
tween one. and one-half miles of Man
ila's walled, town. From Mr. Allison.
an English gentleman, who yesterday
sought the protection of the English
Consul and who has dwelt. in Manila a
long time, I learn, that the Spaniards
have destroyed all of the trees on the
beautiful drive,, called the Luneta, and
also the unrivaled collection of tropical
trees in the botanical gardens. They
have planted sharp bamboo palings for
a space of ten feet wide inside of the
walls, with the points upward, and
; have dug a trench- inside of the bamboo
palings at a distance of ten feet. These
precautions against an attack by
American troops are worthy of that
doughty Chinese warrior, Mr. Confu
cius, but have no place in modern war
fare. Flour is $27 a sack and meat and
other necessities correspondingly high.
This condition prevails, when An
gusti might easily make an honorable
surrender and claim the protection of
the American soldiery. If Aguinaldo
carries the town before the arival of the
: American reinforcements there will be
loot and pillage, ravishment and
i cruelty. Then the black eyes of the
Filipino will snap and he will use the
native knife and he will make good
the -oasts of years! Unjust treatment
has bred rancorous hate, and the sins
of their forefathers will be visited upon
the modern Spaniard!
August! is quoted as saying that the
presence of the big German fleet re
â  minds him of "the cormorant waiting
for the death in order to pick the
: bones."
There has been a decided cooling of
Â° the affections of these quondam friends
j since it has become known that Ger
many desires a coaling station as the |
price if her affection. Germany is play
ing a double game, giving advice to
Aguinaldo and. coquetting with Au- |
erusti. â â¢â¢â â  ":â¢â  ;
The German admiral's launch has !
1 been to and .fro between insurgent I
j headquarters and the German fleet j
many times since our arrival. The Ger- â 
man troopship Darmstadt with soldiers
aboard is expected soon. The German
ships in the bay are the Kaiserin Au
gusta, Princess Wilhelmlna and Kai- !
I ser and three or four smaller vessels, i
, while the Deutscherland and Gefer are
expected. The Kaiserln Augusta is a
splendid vessel, not quite so speedy as j
the Baltimore or Olympia nor as pow
erful as either of these or the Boston or !
Charleston as to guns or armament. â¢
The British are the cruisers Immbr- i
talite and the Bonaventure, with the
; Barfleur and Iphigenia coming. The
French cruisers are the Bruix, the Pas- j
I cal and Bayard, and there are two Jap- i
anese cruisers. It is the opinion of na- :
val men that British have the strongest !
fleet here, not excepting the Americans.
This enforced idleness is giving the
correspondents, of whom there are ;
many, a chance- to study the country. I
have been in two directions for about
six miles toward Manila and away from i
Cavite, and found it a low flat country
covered with a species of locust trees
i and bamboo forests. The bamboo is
almost impenetrable in places and the!
undergrowth is quite thick. The at
mosphere is muggy and damp and the
vegetation rank, while the odor of
tropical flowers is sometimes quite op- j
pressive. I have seen hibiscus bloom
that measures four to" live inches
across. There are many beautiful yel
low blossoms whose names I do not
know. There are large butterflies that
have feathery wings that give them the
appearance of birds. This is a densely
! populated district and people are found
j in the 'midst- of bamboo thickets when
least expected. The poplation in and
around Manila must foot up some 350,
000 souls and in the walled city of Man-
I ila there are some 60,000 people.
In riding through to some of As:ui
1 naldo's posts I have been stopped by
! the comical gentry he calls soldiers,
I but as soon as they discovered I was
I an American I have been allowed to go i
on.
The Filipino reminds me more of our
American Indian than anything else.
and with this exception, that "poor
1..." is more dignified and decent. Why
the American Government should have
i dignified this individual Aguinaldo
with more powers than a Cheyenne
chief is past my nderstanding. With
his mica! clothes and his make-up of
nondescript trousers and bare feet, his
black and green helmet and straw hats,
the insurgent soldier is an appalling
spectacle.. The only thing that I can i
compare the insurgent army uniform |
to is the novel brown canvas â¢ uniform '
of our. own soldiers. At nearly, a mile !
distance apart . aioner the roads there :
1 are small outposts of " the Insurgents. ;
j At each of these is a sergeant or other
I non-commissioned officer in charge of
seven or- eight men. As a result of my j
excursions I should say that Aguinaldo \
Is massing some ten thousand. men to- |
; ward Manila, and that country is not .
as difficult to travel over as had been
reported by natives and journalists
who had been, over the ground: . that 'â 
the climate is' not near so difficult to
live in as people suppose: , that . a
: whit^ may, live here and never need a i
rhysfcian if he exercise ordinary clean- !
liness, takes his siesta regularly ai* j
abjures strong drink. The lesson of
taking a siesta and leaving stimulants
â¢ alone is one that will never be learned j
by the Anglo-Saxon or American un- I
til there have been a number of deaths. i
. The Zafiro dispatch-boat came in this
afternoon and we have news of a bat- j
tie at Santiago de Cuba, in which 600
to 1000 men were killed on the American
side, and stated officially to be a drawn
battle. This has cast a general gloom [
over the camp, and the additional news ;
â  that 4000 Spaniards were killed is no ;
comfort. It is a nasty, drizzly even- !
me, rand there is no air stirring:, and
; although it is not very warm the air
is oppressive. The searchlights are i
flashing very uneasily, and j the Olym- j
pia keens one light persistently pointed j
seaward. It is one of those nichts
when the squeak .of a shoe or the hoot j
; of the midnicht cuckoo is startling.
The friendship of the English has !
j been manifested by cheering from mer- j
chant ships whenever the: opportunity
â¢ has presented itself, and the English
tell me that on the departure ef the
Ani'.'Hcfn : vessels from Hon^koncr the
cheers from the English wat vessels;
were deafening. The Hongkong; Mail '
breaks out as follows with doggerel five ;

1 This :' morning, the " Insurgents : â¢ re- a
called some five hundred men from
the field, and the city of Cavite is pre
senting a more animated appearance
than usual. A large number of the
"marina," or naval force, came in also.
'flies.- mcii look more like Japs than
anything else and make a generally
better appearance than the land forces.
The Filipinos generally are moving
back into the cities from which the
bombardment and the fear of the Span
iards, had driven them. The Ameri
can soldiers are behaving much better
than might be expected. Some are
drinking the native gin, which is rank
poison, and some few have misbe
haved, but this is rare. The Ameri
cans look with wonder upon the little
natives and the natives look upon our
soldiers with like curiosity. An Ameri
can troop of cavalry with American
horses would be the wonder of the age.
The only horse here is a sturdy little
animal about the size of an ordinary
Shetland pony, but thinner and
stronger. One of them will pull a cal
esha, as they call the native carriage,
with a load of four men and a driver,
the combined weight exceeding his four
times. The long wail of taps has sound
ed long ago, and I am tired and sleepy,
and in these latitudes it is necessary
to observe strictly the hours of rest.

SICK REPORTS SHOW
MARKED IMPROVEMENT
Six Men Discharged at the Cavite
Hospital Where Four Are
Received.
FORT BAINT FRANCIS, CAVITE,
July B.â The sick reports of the brigade
to-day show, a marked improvement.
Where six men are discharged four are
taken in. This is gratifying to the
overworked physicians, who have been
unremitting in their efforts with the
men. It may also be due to the fact
that there is not near so mi: h fatigue
duty being done and that the trans
ports are all unloaded. AH loading or
unloading is done by lighters, or "cas
cols." The transports are still here
waiting ballast. Lieutenant McCaine,
U. S. A., yesterday in company with
some newspaper m<^n and ten privates
of the Fourteenth, made a recon
naissance, in the direction of Manila, to
the insurgent outposts. From what
I can learn the statements of Mr. Alli
son are borne out completely. Agui
naldo has the Spanish cooped up in the
city, but owing to different reasons, he
will never be able, without assitance,
to take the town. It is given out by
some of his staff that he will attempt a
i general attack on the town Sunday, but
j this is pooh-poohed by our naval men.
I The monotony of garrison days is va
ried by the occasional booming of guns
; in the bay as foreign warships arrive
I and depart, and the night alarm when
an occasional prowler is fired upon.
There is great activity in the shops of
I the insurgents, cartridges are being
i repolished, ammunition for cannon is
I being fixed. Cannon that the Spaniards
i had spiked on their departure are being
; repaired and the machinery is hum
; ming. The Filipino is clever at almost
; any trade and does not appear to be as
â  lazy as most South Sea people. The
women do nearly all of the heavier
ordinary daily labor, such as agrlcul
! ture work or the carrying of heavy par
j eels. They are also the financial mana
gers. They present a quaint and pic
turesque appearance as they come to
town on the small Chinese horses, with
n pannier on either side and an immense
wicker hat. The horse is almost lost
;to sight. To-day is bright and sunny,
with a cool wind blowing. An ideal
i day SOL y. SHERIDAN.

San Francisco, August 10, IS9B.
* DR. SANDENâ Dear Sir: I am willing to testify to the
â¦â¢ benefit I have received from following your advice and
from the use of your "Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt." I am
*" an engineer on the Southern Pacific Railroad, and have
â¦- suffered for several years with lumbago, dizziness, faint |
and blind spells and a general broken-down feeling, which ;
*" mnde it alrr.ost Impossible for me to make my run. which j
â¦- Is one of the longest on the road. I was advised to try one
of your Belts, and did so, purchasing the one you recom- 1
T mended for my troubles. In two months' time the Belt I
â¦- completely cured me of all my troubles, and I can now
a make my run with the greatest ease and comfort; In fact
T have never had a pain or bad feeling after five days' use
â¦â  of the Belt, and have more life In me than I have. had for
4. years. I always feel better and livelier than those around ;
me, and my friends congratulate me on looking so well. I
â¦â  will advise' my friends that are ailing as I was to try your |
a. Helt for I can lay my restoration to health to nothing else
than the use of Dr. Sanrien's Electric Belt. With kindest (

: DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT :
f Is a grand remedy for all weakness in men. It assists Nature by a general reinforcement +
â¢â  of vital energy by infusing a mild, warming, invigorating current of electricity into the -â¦â 
*" nerves, and by supplying the system with the very essence of nerve vigor and nerve +
I strength. 4"

Study yourself. Weakness in the vital organs is unnatural in all men. It is due to improper care .of +
. the functions endowed by nature with perfect vigor, and since nature gives this strength, if it has been wasted, T
she must be called : upon to renew it. " Natural remedies must be used. Nothing bears a closer relation to
*" the elements of vital and nerve force than electicity. It is natural. .It is nature embodied in a portable, con- "*"
f- venient and effective appliance when Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is used. It is as good for women as for men. +

CEVERfI LIONIZED
BY ThJE BOSTONESE.
BOSTON, Aug. 13. â Admiral
Cervera of the Spanish navy and
his suite of officers passed
through Boston to-day en route
to Portsmouth, N. H., to visit
the prisoners who formerly
manned the admiral's ships. The
officers accompanying Admiral
Cervera were Paymaster Edu
ardo Uriapilleta, Lieutenant Cer
vera, the admiral's son, and Ju
nior Lieutenant Marcia Diaz.
Almost every step of the Span
ish admiral was attended by a
throng who cheered, applauded
and even patted the old gentle
man on the back.
At the Union station several
thousand persons gathered and
when Admiral Cervera came out
of the dining-room hundreds
rushed at him like football play
ers. They seized his hand and
shouted and cheered until the
rotunda echoed. All through
the ordeal he smiled pleasantly
and bowed, tipping his hat to
the throng. With great difficulty
he reached his train.
WHITELAW REID MAY
SUCCEED SECRETARY DAY
Indications Point to His Selection as
the Head of the State Depart
ment.
NEW YORK, Aug. 13.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: When Secretary of State
Day is appointed a member of the com
mission which will determine the final
disposition of the Philippines and ne
gotiate the treaty of peace with Spain,
he will, as has been stated in the Her
ald, definitely retire from the Cabinet.
In view of the certainty that there
will be an early vacancy at the head of
the State Department. President Mc-
Kinley is giving attention to the ques
tion of Secretary Day's successor at the
same time that he is considering whom
he shall appoint as other members of
the peace commission. Embassador
Hay, I understand, is being seriously
considered for the place, but indications
to-night point strongly to the selection
of Mr. Whitelaw Reid. Mr. Reid's fa
miliarity with public affairs and his
wide experience would qualify him for
the place, and he has also the advan
tage of sufficient wealth to enable him
to entertain on a scale commensurate
with the dignity of the head of a de
partment charged with the conduct of
the foreign relations of the Govern
ment.
NEW YORK. Aug. 13.â A dispatch to
the Herald from Chattanooga, Term.. says:
Secretary of State Day will be appointed
United States Judge for the Sixth Cir
cuit as soon as he resigns from the Cab
inet at the close of the war. This was
learned on the most trustworthy author
ity here to-day.

One of the greatest strikes the county
has seen in a long time w;ip made this
v.>-k in the Brewer and Adams mine,
some of the ore extracted showing a val
ue of $15,000 per ton. The property in
situated on the west side of Turnback
Creek, and is an extension of the Pine
nut. A shaft was started down on a vein
twenty-two inches wide at the surface,
but at 55 feet, the present depth and
point where the strike was made, it had
widened out so that in the bottom there
are twenty inches of solid, well-defined
quartz, with two feet or more of vein
matter of the ribbon rock variety. It is
strictly a free-milling proposition, there
being no sulphurets.â Sonora Union-Dem

Four Big Sailing Vessels to Leave

Some needless anxiety is felt over the
long passages being made by the barks
George F. Manson and General Fairchild
from Australia. The Manson Is now out
102 days from Sydney, N. S. W., and ten
guineas reinsurance has been paid on her.
While the Fairchild, 118 days out from
Newcastle, N. S. W., only calls for five
guineas reinsurance. The vessels are
both loaded with coal, and the- fear is j
that they may have caught lire. There Is !
not much chance of that; however, as fine
weather has been reported by all incom
ing vessels, so there would be no diffi
culty about taking off the hatches and ,
airing the cargo.
The George F. Manson has not been
seen since she left port, but the General
Fairchild was spoken on July 4 in lati
tude 21 north, longitude 14.", west, by the
British bark Martha Fisher. The latter j
arrived here July 31, making the run from
the same port as the Fairchild in sev- ;
enty-seven days. Captain Ferris reports
that when he passed the Fairchild she
was under all sail, but was only, making
a scant three knots an hour, while his
vessel was making at least twice that
speed. He expected to reach ' San Fran- j
cisco fifteen days ahead of her, and his ex- j
pectations will probably be realized.
When spoken, the Fairchld was in about
the latitude of Hawaii, and the bark Mo- j
hican Is now out thirty-six days from
Honolulu, while nearly all the vessels
from Australia have been making long
passages, and the captains report light
winds and calms as the causes of delay.
The British ships CelticÃaceand Langdale j
were ninety-four days getting here from
Newcastle, N. S. W., while the American
bark Big 'Bonanza was ninety-two days
from Sydney, so it, can be seen that, in
spite of the reinsurance, the chances are
all in favor of the Manson and Fairchild.
The damage to the torpedo-boat de
stroyer Farragut will be repaired in a
few days, and about the end of the week
the vessel will have another test on me
bay. The accident to the vessel did not
happen when she was returning from her
trial, nor was she going at a high rate
of speed at the time. The warship was
about to move away from the wharf, and
all the lines had been cast off. The signal
to go astern slow was given, but instead
of going astern the Farragut went ahead.
Eight or ten feet of the stem was twisted.,
and that necessitated the removal of the

PLANNING TO
CHECK THOSE
STREET JOBS
Mayor Phelan May Block the
Awarding of Contracts by
the Supervisors.
Specifications Will Be Required to Explicitly
Specify Work to Be Done for the City.
An Eastern Example.
There was a noticeable stir around
the City Hall yesterday; caused by the
expose In The Call of the bold fraud
which was sought to be perpetrated on
the city treasury by the Supervisors
â  through jugglery of contracts for re
pairing and repaying bituminlzed
s-treuts.
"Strikes 'em \,hard under the belt,"
and "Shows up the rotten scheme."
were some of the remarks heard.
The Street Committee of the Super
visors, whose "open door" specifica
tions for repairs and re-covering of
streets caused the Investigation and
the expose, was by no means. In pood
humor and had a number of hard
things to say about "meddlesome
newspapers" generally. That the game
was blocked was only one feature of
the offense. The past history of the
street repairing contracts and of the
city's expensive attempt to do the work
itself, which was-so mercilessly shown
up. simply disgusted the gang of poli
ticians who are in the public service for
boodle only. The act of The Call in
printing the bald facts shown by the
records was noi appreciated at its
proper value by these thrifty patriots.
â¢As for Mayor Phelan, he proclaimed
â¢ himself to be as much disgusted as the
. Street Committee politicians, but for a
different reason.
â¢â â¢ ."Another attempt to rob the city,"
"was his murmured ejaculation, as he
â¢perused The Call's plain statement of
-.the facts.
While he was busied; In this way a
' reporter dropped in upon him at his
.private office in the Phelan building:.
The Mayor had not yet finished re?.d
â  \Tig the article, but his observations
.â¢were quick and to the point.
. "Approve this job?" he queried with
r'sinu eyebrows. "Not until I know â 
â !y what the work advertised nn
.â¢d~r these specifications consists of to
.the smallest detail. I propose t<> ascer
-â ' tain whether the contractor is to do
worth of work or $15,000 worth
." for the fixed sum to be awarded him
' under the bid. I nm studying the specl
â¢ Orations at this time and have also
.; been over some of the streets which
the- Supervisors' expert says need re
i^.ying. Ore crossing mentioned in the
' .list certainly is in first class condition.
That fact I have already ascertained.
further. The inclusion of that crossing
. ip certainly a mistake. Other mistakes
â  an possible. I will fln.<! out for myself.
'There is plenty of time."
'What is your opinion of specifloa
â libns for street repairing and repaying
that do not specify whether the con-
tractor Is to do much or little work for
â  lits money, the payment being a fixed
' sum?" was asked,
â  "Any ime who understands matters
â¢â¢at all knows that such loose specifica
tions Invir- fraud," tersely replied Mr.
. Phelan. "But I will study the whole
â¢matter over and be prepared to act as
the circumstances require. No street
â repairing and repaying contract shall
be let with my consent that does, not
exactly specify the work."
â¢The matter of the award of the con
tract comes up before the Supervisors
on next Monday afternoon, and a warm
session is expected. Members Smith
and Lackmann are outspoken in opposi
tion 'to the award of the contract to the
â  City Street Improvement Company,
claiming that Bingham's $23,000 bid for
repairs and nine and one-half cents for
repaying !s the lowest. Supervisor
Britt Is the champion of the Improve
ment Company on its straight bid of
$37,797. Since The Call lias shown up
the inwardness of the whole matter It
Is quite probable that Smith and Lack-
Hi'ann will light any award under the
present specifications, although they
make no announcement for the presÂ«
. ent of theliÂ» intentions.
It is Interesting In this connection to

â¢city of- Cincinnati, Ohio, the corrup
tion Incidental t'i the letting of con

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Weak
Men
ATTENTION !
I suffered for years from sexual weak-
ness, seminal losses, varicocele, stricture,
"atrophy, neurasthenia, brain and nerve
exhaustion. I was robbed, swindled and
nearly killed by quacks, advertising doc-
tors, medical institutes, etc. A brother
clergyman told me he had suffered from
the same troubles that 1 had. that he
was treated and cured at small expense
by 'an honest firm of manufacturing
.chemists, and advised me to write to
t-hem; I did so; they sent me a small
book.- I read it, followed the advice
'therein given, and was permanently cured
for a .few dollars.
I would advise every man that Is suf-
. fer.lng from any weakness or disease to
1 write at once to Lea. Wood & Co.. Man.
â¢ufacturing Chemists, Lowell, Mass.. for
.a copy of their book entitled "A Practi-

â¢ quacks and . swindlers.

to make the celebration in San .Ins.- on

grandest that has ever been held under
the auspices '>f the Callfornian organiza
tion.
San Franclsrn will be represented In
the celebration by twenty-eight parlors.
Alameds County by six and Santa Clara
by three. The work of preparation here
Is being carried on under the direction
of a joint committee, composed of repre
sentatives from the parlors â¢>!' this city
i and from tl.ose of Alameda County, the
officers of which are; Charles E. Mooser
Of Presidio Parlor, president; Robert W.

oral of them had evidently made out
bids expecting: to do slipshod work, as
hnd been the custom before. Several
were compelled to make apslgrimente,
not beine able llnancially to do the
work on the specified lines, nnd the ex
pectant politicians Interested got no
"divvy," but the city of Cincinnati se
cured a complete first class repaying
of her principal business and residence
streets at the moderate cost of $4,000,000
to the municipality and an additional
$4,000,000 to the abutting property own
ers. The miles upon miles of granite.
and asphalt laid at that time is still in
first class condition, but the contrac
tors who were beaten by the public at
their own gxme have not yet recovered
from that tired feelinp.
The example of the Cinclnnatians
may yet be followed by the taxpayers
of San Francisco, who have about
reached tli" limit of their endurance of
bold-faced Bteals. A careful watching
of the contractors who may repave
streets in this cityâ a comparison of
their daily work with the specifications
â will tend to prevent the slipshod
work which has prevailed in the past.
The contractors will be obliged to make
the concrete bases of streets sufficient
ly firm to prevent future sinking, and
to spread a two and a half inch layer
of bitumen instead of a one and a half
Inch layer â always supposing that the
specifications are properly drawn and
that the authorities pay attention to
the complaints of citizen volunteer In
spectors regarding attempted viola

ways be depended upon to publish the
substantiated statements of any citi
zens regarding non-performance of
conditions and specifications by con
tractors.
' while not members of either organization,
| will visit the Garden City during the days
of the festivities.
In <arli of the local parlors the subject
i of the celebration has been discussed dur
ing the past three weeks, atnl Borne of
have already completed th>-ir ar
rangements. California Parlor No. 1 has
secured headquarters In the Druids' Hall
in Han Jose, and has adopted as uniforms
for its members, white duck pantaloons,
light-colored negligee shirts, with '!â¢â¢ to
match, am] straw hats. It has secured
the services of Blanchard's band. <>n the
afternoon of the 9th there will be a prom
i epade conceri at headquarters. The mem
j bers of Bnena Vista Parlor of the Native
Daughters will be the special guests of
this parlor.
Stanford Parlor No. 76 will turn out In
j grand style. It has secured headquar
i ters at the Vendome, and has arranged
! the following programme: Parades to the
San Jose train on the night of the Sth
of September; reception on that night in
i headquarters; <>n the morning of the 9th.
parade in San Jose, in uniform of dark
' coat and pantaloons, white vest, black
tie, and straw hat. Kach member will
carry a can.- of California laurel; after
noon, concert on the lawn of the hotel
by the parlor's band of sixteen pieces; in
the evening, grand ball In the hotel. On
the 10th the parlor will take part In the
clambake at Agricultural Park, and on
the llth will go to Alum Rock, where a
bullshead breakfast will be served.
Sequoia Parlor No. ISO, ever nllve and
ready to support these annual celebra
tions, will do all In Its power to present
an attractive fenture In the grand pa
rade, and to that end there has been a
personal appeal to each member. The
committee Is of the opinion that Sequoia
will not be In the background at San
Jose. The members will wear white duck
pantaloons, golf shirt, blue flannel cout,
white yachting cap and white canvas
shoes. The Native Sons' band, led by
Professor Sousa Barton, will furnish the
music on the occasion of the night parade
and in San Jose. During the coming
week this parlor will decide exactly what
special feature it will have, and will also
arrange the programme for the enter
tainment of guests during Friday, Satur
day and Sunday In San Jose.
I'recita Parlor No. 187 will in the pro
| cession be preceded by a drum corps,
: and the members will parade In the uni
form that Is worn by the men of the
United States navy while on duty In the
tropics. The members wish it under
stood that they will wear a full uniform.
and not what some of the navy wore at
Manila recentlyâ a pair of hlgh-wnter
pantaloons and a sweet smile. At San
Jose the parlor will have a string band and
j give concerts and a dance at headquar
ters, having secured a iarge hall.

REPRODUCTION OF SCENES OF
THE LATE WAR.
Pyrotechnics and Special Features
Will Unite the Parts of This
Spectacular Display.
The (spectacular pyrotechnic production
of the "Battle of Manila" at Centra! I 'ark
promises to be one of the great attrac
tions in the line of entertainments In the
very near future. Neither money nor
pains have been spared to present the sev
eral principal acts of the drama of the
recent war with Spain in a startling but
realistic manner.
The opening scene will show the har
bor of Havana. On the shore the in
habitants are presented as attending a
fete given by Governor General Blanco
when the battleship Maine, Its dirks
crowded with oflli its. marines and sailors,
steams proudly In and salutes the fortu.
A launch is lowered and Captain Slgsbee
Is curried to the shore, where he is wel
comed by the Governor General, who
causes a ballet, "The Birth of the Stars
and Strip's." to be danced by 2W young
ladles attired In the American national
colors. The ballot of the .bullfighters will
also be executed. In this scene the
famous Cuban premiere. Senorita Evange
line Ztqurina, will perform characteristic
national dances. The. destruction of the
Maine concludes the tirst scene. This
feature will be grand and realistic.
Jn thirty seconds the scene is complete
ly changed to the interior of Fort i "ax-he.
where a tribe of Philippine Islanders . 'i
form their fantastic and religious rite,
"The Devil Dance." The American :l<>-t
appears, the bombardment ol Manila he

that is being done by the members of
his parlor and those of San .Tone and Palo
Alto parlors In arranging for the big
event. He says that It will surpass the
celebration held there a few years since,
and that not only are the Native Sons
and the Native Daughters, but all classes,
are Interesting themselves in having it
said in the future that the San Joseans
outdid themselves, In their efforts to
please.
But a small portion of the day will be
taken up in the parade on the 9th, as it
is not the desire of the grand marshal
to make the participants take a long
tramp. The committee has arranged for
the grand clambake at the Agricuturai
Park on the 10th, and for the bullshead
breakfast at Alum Rock. In the interims
there will be an opportunity for the sev
eral parlors that are to have headquar
ters to receive their friends and have In
dependent celebrations. The streets
along the line of march will be lavishly
decorated.
There was a large attendance of dele
gates to the joint 9th of September cele
bration committee meeting In Native
Sons' Hall last night.
The transportation committee gave nn
account of what arrangements had been
made with the railroad company for spe
cial trains on the Bth of September and
subsequently.
Delegate Lees made the wonderful an-
nouncement that one of the leading hotels
In San Jose, instead of Increasing its
rates, had given notice that It had re
duced its rates 50 cents.
A proposition to throw the responslbll
lt\ of appointing ticket sellers on the
transportation committee was defeated ,
and the treasurer will name the ticket
sellers.
Grand Marshal Gaston mode an appeal
to the San Francisco parlors for music,
and stated that there had been a change
In regard to the bullshead breakfast and
the clambake. The former will be given
on Saturday Instead of Sunday, and the
latter will be on Sunday. He said the
grp nd ball will be given in the pavilion in
which the rose carnival was held.

JACK HAWTHORNE'S LETTER
TO HIS MOTHER.
In th* Field, Tuba, July 6.
Dearest Mother:
I nrrlte to l"t you know tliat I am still alive
nn.l well, t;ioug!i I nm rather surprised to find
myself BO
We had a terrible battle that lasted three
days, and in which we lost 1600 Ktllel and

BATTLE OF RAN JUAN.
wounded. I never expected to come through
the battle alive, much less without a scratch.
At least a dozen men were killed or wounded
imht around me.
The major of our battalion called for two
men to go forward and locate the enemy, so I
and another man called Botts .tumped up and
ran forward to where we could see the Span-
iards on Ihe hill.
It -â¢â â¢â â :;â  â ! certain death to get up. the bullets
were flying so thick, but We grot back all right
and reported. Uotta was afterward shot
through the leg:.
1 have lost everything except the clothe*
I have on. Your loving son,
JACK HAWTHORNE.
Company A, 71st New York Volunteers.
But no. Jack Hawthorne had not lost
: his most pteclous possession uf all â
! the heroic blood that in his
veins. Heroic blood it was that prompt-
ed both him and Private Butts at Ihe
same instant to jump up and rush f >r-
(vard with siir)i alacrity in the face <>f
I almost certain death.
Ail the world knows the name of this
young fellow's grandfather. Nathaniel
Hawthorne, author of the "Scarlet Let-
ter" and "The Marble Faun," master-
pieces of English literature, but who
has heard of Botts, the unromantic cog-
nomen of the youngster's equaily bravo
cc-mpanion? What forefathers have
han I'd down to him the blood from
which heroes are made?
HEROISM IS IN THE BLOOD.
"Blood will tell" is an axiom that in
all the ages has never been gainsaid.
i Every man who do.>s a brave, heroic
act carries within his veins a quality of
blood that urges and sustains him. No
matter whether he Inherits it from a
long line of famous ancestors or from
I the Bound a nil healthy constitution of
his Immediate parents, whose only dis-
tinction is honorable toil and a simple,
virtuous life.
It matters little where or how you
obtain it. but it matters all the world
that by some means yon possess good
blood. Good blood is first, last and
always the making of manly men and
womanly women. It Is the source of
all courage, virtue and happiness.
CAN A MAX MAKE HIMSELF A
HERO.'
"A man's first duty," said Henry
Ward Beecher, in a grand sermon on
human development, "is to be a good
animal. " A man may himself begin
the rehabilitation of his physical pow-
ers, laying the foundation of his own
manliness and of an inheritance for
those who come after him more pre-
cious than fine gold and rubies.
Men and women who are sick,
wretched and Incapacitated for their
full share, in the daily, hourly struggle
for existence, ought to carefully deter-
mine whether or not their mental,
moral and physical faculties may be
Improved and advanced surely to a
higher and nobler plane.
WHY I'EOPLE DESPAIR.
In the depth of sickness and wretch-
edness men feel that their days of cour-
age and usefulness are ended, women
feel that they will never rm.-re be equal
to the duties and burdens that come
upon a wife and mother; but too often
this sad conclusion, and the deep and
hopeless despondency that accompanies
it, are entirely erroneous.
It comes because manly mentality
and womanly courage have been sap-
ped and undermined by the subtle, dis-
integratins poteen of physical debility
and mal-nutrition. The spirit ceasÂ«s to
be "willing" because the flesh is weak;
the blood is Impoverished, the nutritive
powers depleted. It is by overcoming
these physical disabilities and restoring
the forces of nutrition to full and com-
plete vitality that Dr. Plerce's wonder-
ful "Golden Medical Discovery" gives
back to men and women their true
birthright of hopefulness, endurance
and heroism.
WHAT TWO SOLDIERS SAY.
"Four months ago I did not think to
be in shape to assist our 'Uncle Samuel'
in case of hostilities," said a Florida
gentleman, A. D. Weller, Esq., of Pen-
sacola, in a letter to Dr. Pierce. 'But
thanks to you I am n<,-w ready for the
'Dons.' Since receiving your diagnosis
of my cnse as stomach trouble and liver
complaint I have taken eight bottles of
Dr. Plerce's (iold^n Medical Discovery,
and must say that I am transformed
from a 'walking shadow' (as my friends
called me) t<Â« perfect health."
"Thirteen years ago I was wc-unded
by a ball passing through my lung."
says George 11. Belcher, Esq., of Dor-
ton. Pike Tounty, Ky. "I have had a
bad cough ever since, with shortness of
breath, and it was very easy to take
cold; thp slightest change of weather
would cause the cough to be so bad I
would have to sit up in bed all night
"I could not eat nor sleep at times; I
was all run down; I could not work a-
all. A few months ago I began using
Dr. Flerce's Golden Medical Discovery.
I have not used more than two bottles
and now I can eat, sleep and work, and
I feel like a new man. I cannot find
words to sufficiently recommend Dr.
| DR. PIERCES REMEDIES
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery, or
tell the good it has done me."
THE BASIS OF POWER.
The extraordinary effect of this
great "Discovery" upon the digestive
and nutritive organism, which is the
basis of all physical renewal, ffives it
efficient potency in all those complaints
of both adults and children associated
with debility, emaciation and loss of
stamina. It is the sovereign remedy
above all medicines ever invented for
overcoming severe, chronic, lingering
coughs, throat and bronchial com-
plaints, bleeding from the lun^s and all
kindred ailments, which, if neglected,
or badly treated, lead on to that dread
disease â consumption.
It obliterates poisonous bile-products
and disease-germs from the circulation
and the skin; expels morbid accumula-
tions from the bronchial tubes and
lung cells: gives keen assimilative pow-
er to the digestive Juices and blood-
making gland?; and supplies an abund-
ance of that pure, regenerating, nu-
tritive material which builds up
healthy tissue, muscular flesh and vital
nerve force. It regenerates the blood,
and thereby rejuvenates the man.
WHAT MA: ES NERVE-POWER?
Fur delicate, nervous, broken-down
and emaciated invalids it is a thous-
and times preferable to nauseous emul-
sions, ur delusive stimulants, malt ex-
tracts ;m<l alcoholic "compounds." It
do* a not give a mere temporary stimu-
lus to the nerves. It feÂ»-ds them: it re-
builds them; it makes rich blood and
transforms it into healthy nerve-fiber.
GREAT SUFFERING.
"My health had been failing for sev-
eral years," writes Mrs. Sophia A.
Slemp. of Sugurgrove. Smyth to.. Va.,
"I had hot flashes and at times a dread-
ful hurting in my back above the loins;
I could not rest at night on account of
hot spells. L,ast spring I began to feel
ho weak I could scarcely do my work,
and in April I broke down completely.
I had indigestion and kidney trouble.
The back of my head and neck would
be so tired I could not rest. The left
side of my face ached, but the pains
and achps yielded under the influence
of Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discov-
ery and 'Pleasant Pellets.' I had also
a severe pain in my left limb. I tried
different liniments but received no re- ]
lief. I could not lie still on account of
the suffering in my body. My limbs ,
and fe^t were cold, although I was in a
perspiration nearly all the time. Some- j
tities I would have to be propped up in
btd all night, and even then could sleep
but little.
"I sent for the doctor and asked if he
could cure me. He said he had never:
failed but a time or two. I took his
treatment about three weeks and was
no better, but worse If anything, so I
decided to try Dr. Pierces Golden Mcd- i
ical Discovery. I bought six bottles i
but I had only to take four bottles of
the 'Golden Medical Discovery' and two
vials of the 'Pleasant Pellets' and I !
was able to do my work again. I have
thus far had no return of the disease. I
feel better this spring than I have felt
for several seasons. I have no hot I
spells like I had for several years. If I j
had taken your treatment sooner, no l
doubt I could have kept that bad spelj
ofT. but I am truly thankful thr>.t T took
your medicine and found a cure. I
shall ever praise the medicine that ;
cured me and will recommend it to all I
suffering as I was."
DANGERS AVOIDED.
This matchless "Golden Medical Dis-
covery" is absolutely free from alcohol.
It Is totally unlike the numerous "sars-
aparilias." "tonics," "compound" "malt-
extracts." and so-called blood purifiers
which contain so large a per-
centage of alcohol that their persistent
use is almost certain to awaken a mor-
bid craving for stimulants. The "Gold-
en Medical Discovery" is a temperance
medicine, pure and simple. Tt may be
used with perfect confidence in a tem-
perance family. Thereby all dancer of
contracting the alcohol habit is avoided
The unparalleled reputation of Dr
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery has
led some unscrupulous dealers to take
advantage of the almost universal de-
mand by attempting to substitute soni-
other article in which they have a
greater interest. Any druggist who
evinces his contempt for your ludgment
by trying to foist upon you something
different from what you "ask for on the
plea that his substitute is "just as
good" should be met by a fiat" refusal
to discuss the question. Show him that
you have a mind of your own.
The splendid Invalids' Hotel and Sur-
gical Institute at Buffalo N V of
which Dr. Pierce Is the chi^f consulting
physician, is the model medical institu-
tion of America: Dr. Pierces staff of
nearly a score of associate specmUdta
includes the moÃt eminent experts In
every field of practice.
NO CHARGE.
No charge Is made for consultation by
mail, and any one writing to Dr. Pierce
will receive a cordial, earnest, prompt
reply, containing the best professional
advice obtainable in America without
one cent of cost, and the treatment sug-
gested will be always the most simple,
sensible and Inexpensive.
AX UNMATCHED EXPERIENCE.
It should be remembered that Dr.
Pie rep in his thirty years of practical
experience at the head of his great in-
stitution, hns successfully treated more
cases of severe, obstinate, chronic dis-
eases than the average local prac-
titioner ever heard of. His great 1000-
page illustrated "Common Sense Med-
ical Adviser" has had a greater sale
than any other medical book ever pub-
lished in any language. Three-quar-
ters of a million copies were sold at

TWO STREET CARS CRASH TOGETHER
Serious Accident Narrowly Averted at the Junction of Geary j
and Market Streets. j
A SERIOUS street-car accident.^was
narrowly', avert eel yesterday rafter
noon at the junction of Geary and
Market streets. Seemingly through
carelessness -car 363 of the Geary-Street
line crashed into a Kearny-street car,
wrecking the rear end and disabling
one of the passengers. Both cars- were
crowded at the time, and ihe escape of
the passengers from being seriously
Injured seems miraculous.
The accident happened whenvKparny
street was lined with the usual Satur
day afternoon crowd.
According to Officer George Brown,
who witnessed the accident; the north
bound Kearny-street car had crossed
Market street and when in front of

POSTPONED
Gen. Merriam Waiting
for Instructions.
TROOPS ARE DISAPPOINTED
TO SEND SOLDIERS MIGHT BE A
HOSTILE ACT.
It May Be Necessary to Consult the
French Embassador, Who Is
the Representative of
Spain.
The troops designated to go to Manila
on the transport Arizona will not embark
to-day, as Major General Merriam is un
der the impression that it would be a vio
lation of the armis: rward any
more troops to the Philippines. It is a
: war that an armistice carries with
ition of hostilities, and to send
the troops on the Arizona at this lime
might be construed as an act- of hostility.
To settle all doubt upon the question and
to be on the safe side. Genera! Merriam
rday morning telegraphed to the
War Department for information and in
structions, but up to 11:30 last night he
had received no reply. At that hour he
said positively that the troops would not
embark until after he hears from Wash-
ington:
At 3-30 o'clock yesterday afternoon he
sent instructions to Brigadier General
Miller at Camp Merritt to suspend all
preparations for embarkation until fur
ther orders. This news caused great dis
appointment among the troops. whim
had begun packing up and getting every
thing in readiness to go on board the
steamer this afternoon.
eral Merriam expressed the opinion
evening that the question which
arises from his telegram of inquiry is
being carefuly considered by the authori
ties at Washington, and that a c
ence with the French Embassador,
Spain's representative, and even a cable
to Madrid run;. I â ry before a de
cision can i c reached. Meantime the
troops will have to possem impatience.
It may be possible that General Merriam
will receive an answer to his telegram to
day.

bers of the Mrs. Leland Stanford Division [

the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engin- :
oers. were the guests of Mrs. Stanford at !

i ceived and entertained for an hour, after j
which they were escorted to the museum, i
i the university buildings, and the famous â 
i Palo Alto stables. During his lifetime
: Mr. Stanford was a warm friend of the
engineers and that friendship has been

THROUGH A WINDOW.
Blockaded Her Own Door so That the
Owner of the House Cannot
Regain Possession in Her
Absence.
Imprisoned In a roooi^ of the upper
story of the Milton S. Latham mansion
on Folsom street, near Second, Is Mrs.
Rogers, her little baby and her sister.
Ingress and egress to her room by way
of the ordinary mode of entrance is barred.
The occupants of the room enter and
leave by a window leading out on to the
roof and thence by the employment of
some acrobatic skill to an L in the house
by means of a broken pane of glass.
Behind all this mystery is the simple
story (if delinquency In rent and a deter
mination, apparently, not to pay and not
to give an opportunity for â¢ seizure of
th- apartment. Mrs. Rogers rented the
room in the historical old house, which
In the palmy days of Rincon Hill was the
scene of some of the most brilliant sociaJ
gath.-riiiKs in the history of this city.
She was accompanied by her mother,
Mrs. Can*, her Â«isiÂ»T. Miss Flon-ncr- Garr,
and by- her babe in arms. Her rent was
not forthcoming at th.' proper time, until
now there Is a large arrearage. The
landlady. Mrs. Erouillard, was more than
lenient, but her patience was at last ex
hausted She tried to collect the amount
due her, but did not succeed. Recently
she found that the door was fastened
from the inside.
The Imprisonment i* voluntary.
Mrs. Brouiilard has sent carpenters and
locksmiths to unfasten the door, but to
â no purpose. They Could not get at the
Seat of tin- trouble inside the room.
The case of Mrs. Rogers became the
talk of the neighborhood. Her visits over
th>- roof at all hours of the day and night
excited the curiosity of an who could see
her strange actions. The mystery deep
ened until thÃ iast week it lias assumed
another phase. Mrs. Rogers has com
plained to. the Society for the Prevention
hi Cruelty to Children and to Assistant
Prosecuting Attorney Frank Drury of
Police Court 2.
To the representatives of the society
her plaint was that her Landlady was
cruel in compelling the children to go
over the roof and through the broken
window to reach the "stairway leading out
of the house. To Mr. Drury she com
plained of disturbing noises, which inter
fere with her enjoyment of life.
In neither ease were the authorities
able to find foundation fur the charges.
The persons residing in the house have
taken .sitjes with Mrs. Brouillard as
against her. eccentric tenant. She is pro
nounced generous to a fault in her deal
ings with delinquents who aro such
through adversity. The matter has
ed such a point that its speedy ad
justment Is expected by those interested.
MRS. KLUGE TALKS
OF ANOTHER WILL
Mrs. Kluge is confident that Adolph
Sutro left a will later than the one re
cently published and accepted as his last
testament. T
, The so-called widow of the millionaire
Claims that the deceased told her that he
had deeded to the city the property and
magnificent grounds known as Sutro'
Heights, as well as his valuable library,
and she is positive that a will is in exist
ence In which the same is recorded, as
well as a handsome provision made for
her two-children â Sutro's children.
If no 'such will is forthcoming the lady
does not, hesitate to aav that she will
contest;'the testament submitted and will
make a vigorous battle for the rights of
the children who are entitled to an off
spring's, share of the vast estate left by
the dead millionaire.
If it comes to a legal battle Mrs. Kluge
will make her rights subordinate to those
of her children.
Mrs. Kluge is in deep mourning for the
man whom her children called father. At
the. time of his death she was in Sonoma !
County. 'â â  She remained there with her |
Children, never coming forward to de
mand her. rights as the widow nor the
privileges to which her children were
justly entitled. Sutro's family evidently
expected that the lady would make some
such claims, and therefore it is said they
â¢ decided to surround the obsequies with
privacy. Mrs. Kluge returned to her
| home, 1919 Vallejo street, on Friday, and
at once commenced preparations to es
tablish her rights.
Of the many things the Sutro family are
reported to have said of the woman who
claims to be the widow of their father
and the mother of their half-brother
and half-sister, none rankles so deeply
as the epithet "adventuress," and the
story that they claimed they knew noth
ing about her existence, nor of the chil
dren Adolph and Adolphina.
According to Mrs. Kluge, she met Sutro
about a dozen years ago in his family,
where she occupied the position of seam
stress, and was employed in that capac
ity for several months. After that her
visits to the Heights were many and j
frequent. She went there to see the mas- [
ter and the children to see their father.
The members of Mr. Sutro's family
also knew, so Mrs. Kluge asserts, that
he was in the habit of dining and lunch
ing at her home. During the time that
he was Mayor he constantly had lunch
eon at Mrs. Kluge's, never missing a day
unless it was that he was detained by
urgent business. The lady also alleges
that it was at Sutro's request that the
children were baptized Adolph and Adol
phina Sutro, and that there are thou
sands of witnesses to prove his love and
regard. for them and his promise to pro
vide for them.
": M*. Kluge has no desire for further
publicity nor trouble with the family of
the man she mourns. She hopes : some
settlement agreeable to all may be reach
ed. If not, the fight to establish her
rights will be carried to the bitter end.

j Mortalâ young or oldâ fact, every ' lady and
gentlemanâ or marriedâ who are dis-
contented,' ' unhappy, or - not â¢ ' satisfied in
life, stop, think and reflect â Upon What Does
Success Depend? â It Is that some peo-
â¢ pie seem to succeed In everything they under-
take? While thousands' of : apparently Intel-
ligent and deserving persons fall in every-
thing they attempt to do?'. Others have risen
â  from want and mediocrity i to â  wealth' and
eminence. Many who once bemoaned' their
most unhappy fate have, ;by ( a , peculiar
unexpected and mysterious means discovered
the path that leads to success' and prosperity.
Why is this? Did you ever stop to think that
there might be some force upon which every-
one's success depends? Listen! It Is the prin-
ciple of life. The Psychological or Magnetic
power possessed by few, â¢ and yet within the
reach of all. The one great element In na-
ture which is the fountain head of all exis-
tence. One of Its many principles consists In
mind Attracting mind, by its volition, aided j
by the magnetism of the system any one pos-
sessing this Psychological, power can cause
â  others to receive any impressions of esteem,
love, awe, confidence or respect; they can do
more in business ." transactions, sales, deals,
speculations, gaining friends and obtaining
favors than the combined efforts ~of â  a dozen
persons who use only argument â  and oblig-
ing manners. Some persons are gifted by
nature with strong Psychological powers,
hence ! their phenomenal ' success. The -'only
people who have ever been able to solve â¢ the
problem of generating this .power . so : that
any ' one may 'use it are the Mahatmas
of India. Prof. H. Romaine. late of India,
known the world over, as the "White Ma-
hatma." is one of. the favored few whom
circumstances has enabled to secure . this
knowledge. He holds flattering - testimonials
from prominent residents of this ; city, and
indorsements from eminent people and the
press from' all parts of ;' the world, which are
proof positive of his ability and sincerity of
purpose.
If you are unsuccessful . or wish 'â¢ to - better
your condition in life he
can help [ you. , .

CLAIRVOYANTSâ Continued,
MRS. DR. F. CLARK,
THE WORLD'S GREATEST MEDIUM
AND CLAIRVOYANT, IS LOCATED
PERMANENTLY IN SAN FRANCISCO.
PARLORS 25 AND 26,
1206 MARKET. OPPOSITE SIXTH.
RECOGNIZED BY THE PRESS,
MEDICAL FACULTY AND SCIENTISTS
GENERALLY AS THE FOREMOST
MEDIUM IN THIS COUNTRY.
SHE STANDS WITHOUT A RIVAL.
No matter what trouble you may have with
yourself or others, come and she will guide
you. She advises with a certainty by a higher
than human power, and should not be classed
with card readers, fortune tellers, palmists, as-
trologers and similar humbugs.
Many men with a business which ought to
make them rich struggle for years and merely
make a living. Many good and devoted women
who would have given half their lives for hus-
band, son or lover have had their entire lives
blighted. That these conditions are often con-
trolled by "OCCULT" innuences which can
be changed to others that work for good, both
financially and socially, has been known by a
few in every age.
The first ROTHSCHILD was constantly
gulded by clairvoyant influence, and many suc-
cessful Americans seek this advice regularly.
The clairvoyant gift is imparted to so few and
In such varying degrees that impostors abound
In every large city. Hence many educated per-
sons who secretly wish for its aid are sensitive
about seeking it. This timidity, though, is
rapidly disappearing among the better class of
San Francisco citizens.
THE GREATEST OF ALL TALISMANS,
THE MAOIC BELT.
A
charm
(also called .
a Talisman or
Amulet) possesses
the power to protect
Its possessor against any
evil and promote his luck,
happiness and health. This
power it obtains from its manufac-
turex, who from and through her su-
pernatural power transmits the same to the
talisman. A charm can be made for any pur-
pose. It may serve as a protector on a
Journey or at home, against accident or
'evil influence, which it destroys; It
may guide you safely through
any perilous enterprise, may
help you to complete your
business transactions,
profitably insuring
you against
loss , an d
thus as-
sist
you to acquire wealth. It may be of a mes-
meric character â drawing others" affections to-
ward you and thus securing for you friends
among strangers, and even converting enemies
into friends and bringing esteem, love and
friendship trom all.
IT MAY i'OS.SESS A HEALING POWER
AND CURE DISEASES BY ITS SIMPLE AP-
PLICATION.
That Mrs. Clark's revelations are most won-
dprful and of the highest order, and not
made to satisfy idle curiosity only but in-
tended .to give those who seek the truth
a permanent benefit, is acknowledged by all
who have seen her. Mrs. Clark while en-
tranced will reveal every hidden mystery
in life. Will give correct information of
sickness, death, absent friends, law suits,
divorces, stock speculations, etc. Recovers
lost
or stolen
property.
Locates bur-
led treasures and
minerals of all kinds.
Valuable advice to young
men on marriage and how to
choose a wife for happiness, and
what business best adapted for
speedy riches. Also gives indispensable
advice to young ladies on love, courtship
and marriage, with age. name and description
of future husband. Nothing in life is too
obÃcure for. her to reveal; thoroughly
understands how u> prepare and
work the famous magic and
mesmeric talisman, as pre-
pared and practiced by
the Buddhists. Hin-
doos and wizards
of the Orient.
These magic
t a 1 ls-
mane.
when worn with her instructions and accom-
panied by her powerful work, are guaranteed
to give good luck and (success In business, lot-
tery, speculation, races and all games of
chances In which success is dependent upon
luck, and Insure success in law suits; they re-
move evil influences,- cure ba<i habits, witchery,
fits and long-standing and mysterious diseases
which have, baffled the physician's skill. The
mesmeric talismans are guaranteed to restore
lost affections, . cause speedy and happy mar-
riage with the one you love. and ! cause your
bitterest enemies . to become your dearest
friends. You have no enemies, hufe-flrou are loved
by all while you carry the mesmeric talisman.
Husbands who have been drawn from their
wives by the stronger influences of other
women, or wives who have left their husbands,
will be reunited by this talisman of love. Hus-
bands or parents who have been addicted to
strong drink or have been cruel to their wives
or -children will be made temperate, kind and
loving by this mysterious charm; and girls
whose lovers have sought other faces will be
happily reunited by the same strange power.
If you have lost faith and given up to de-
spair because of former failures, take courage
now and call on Mrs. Dr. Clark without delay.
Conviction will be sure, and happiness and suc-
cess follow.

TYPOS AT DINNER.
The Local Printers' Union Banquet
the Delegates to the State
Convention.
The banquet tomlere<l tho visiting print
ers of tho State convention by the local
union, served at Campl's, last night, was
an elegant rf-pnst, and an eloquent trib-
ute to trades unionism. James H. Barry,
Cyren E. Fisk, David Lubin and. Judge
Robert Ferral talked upon economic
questions and their opposite bearing to
the question of the betterment of the
working people. Their short and enter
taining speeches were in no sense repe
titions of the stock shop talk of the walk
ing delegate and chronic howler, but
quite in line with the real effort of thr.t
element of the trades unions whose de
sire is to satisfactorily settle the differ
ences between the. man who has labor to
sell and the man who purchases that
commodity. There were also short ad
dresses by:
J. K. Phillips. L.. P. Ward, William
Hlnton. A. J. Read. William Clack, <:

HARES MADE
THEIR ESCAPE
Long Courses at Union
Park Yesterday.
SOME VERY FAST SAPLINGS
METALLIC WILL BE PLAYED TO
WIN THE STAKE.
I A Large Concourse of Sport-Lovers
Witnessed the Races at Ingle-
side Park ..'ester
day.
The few days of warm and pleasant
w.ather had excellent effect on the hares
at Union Park yesterday. The little short
tail runners of the Merced plains ran
like demons, and as a consequence many
of them made their escape, much to the
satisfaction of leashmen, who take pleas
ure In .seeing the game, little flyers win
their freedom.
The players of dogs who are wise in
judgment got a severe upset In the first
j course of the open stake. Lightning, a
24 to 1 favorite over Little Dorritt. was
badly beaten. liberty Bell defeated
i Camilla after a "no course." Right Bower
| and Forget had three hard courses. The
first and second were "no goes," but when
they met the third time Bower won eas
ily. Tod Sloan was not in condition, and
| having been withdrawn by his owner,
| Lightning ran a bye with Glenstone, the
; hare escaping.
Capadura gave the favorite Hercules a
good run for the i!ag. Hercules sold a
7 to 1 favorite. Mystery and Tic Tac were
withdrawn. Minerva, a shortender, beat
Commodore, who did not run up to form;
but Minerva, nevertheless, ran a very
fast course,
Sweet Lips easily disposed of Governor
Markham, and as she will meet Metallic
to-day the race should be well worth see-
Ing. She will give Metallic a hot race if
a Btrong hare is met. Victor Chief, an
Eastern dog of good breeding, ran away
from Elmer G during the 4irst half of the
! course, but he died away long before the
finish. It Is doubtful If he will win his
first course to-day.
In the sapling stake Lopez' dogs s.ir
i prised the talent. Santa Inez romped
! away from Read Agent, and Santa Ana
easily disposed of Thisbe. Santiago slip
ped for the first time, ran unsighte.l tor
quite a distance, but when he got down
to running he showed great speed and
endurance.
The' result of the day's meeting is as
follows:
Open stake; first roundâ Little Dorritt beat
Lightning; Jennie Wilson beat Tocaloma;
Mona beat St. Carlo; Liberty Bell beat Ca
milla: Cavalier, beat Sportsman; Lalla Rookh
beat Scbley; Right Bower beat Forget; Glen
stone beat Tod Sloan; Douglas beat Crusader;
Laurelwood 11 beat Little Doubt; Gladys Pasha
beat Native Son; Jesse Moore beat Glen wood;
Minneapolis beat Little Delight; Lady Blanche
beat TobÂ«Â»co: Rapid beat Black Pattl; Her
cules beat Capadura: Vanity Fair beat Moon
light; Mountain Beauty beat Lanky Bob;
Glen Rosa beat Highland Ball; Bendalong beat
Miller's Maid: Trier'. n beat Llssak; Wlldflower
beat Bouncing Biddy: Minerva beat Commo
dore: Sweet Lips beat Governor Markham; Me
tallic beat Seldom; Victor Chief beat Elmer Ci:
Wlnona beat Dr. Norman: Grasshopper beat
Chill Pepper: Van Knapp beat The Got-soon;
Lord Byron beat Alnmeda.
Sapling stake: result â Santa Inez beat Road
Agent- Santa Ana beat Tntebe; Rollicking
Airs beat Santiago; Lady Garnet beat Santa
Rita: Bit of Fashion beat St. Elmo.
Judging from the manned in which Bit
of Fashion ran yesterday she should win
the first prize, with Santa Ana second.
COURSING AT INGLESIDE.
A Large List, of Entries Fur-
nishes Exciting Sport to
Spectators.
Eighty-eight dops competed in the in
itial run-down of the all-nged stakÂ»- a 1
Ingleside yesterday. This large entry
kept the bettoPi on the move, and fur
nished exciting sport to the many hun
dred spectators that were In attendai cÂ« .
The greatest surprise of the day was
occasioned when Daisy L, a practically
unknown quantity, lowered the colors of
the great Mlalmo, at odds of 14 to 1. The
winner of the Merced stake last year was
looked upon as Invincible, and therefore
very few bettors got aboard the ripe odds.
Wlu-n the white Hag was raised declaring
Daisy 1- the winner the bettors fairly
yelled in surprise. The unknown dog set
the pare and worked the hare throughout,
winning a deserving course.
Previous to the former race the talent
had things their own way. not a short
ender landing, although the odds aver
aged 15 to 1.
Among the notable courses of the day
was that of Sylvia and Hot Stuff. In

their first trial it was undecided, the fa
vorite leading before being outworked.
In the run-off Hot Stuff led by fifteen
lengths and wun easily. The reason for
his poor work in the first trial was QUe
to his picking up a small stick, which re
mained wedged in his foot.
Lottie M ami Chiquita also put up an
exciting contest. Tlv- former led. but
Chiquita got in and coverrd the hare to
Lottie's exclusion. In the second trial it
wns Lottie's game throughout, Chiquita
running wide.
The most exciting course of the day
was between Swinnerton and Phoebe,
they running a long no go. On going back
to "the slips Svlnnerton led, but Phoebe
got in on the bare at the lower corner of
the field in one of the most twisting and
exciting courses ever run on the sward.
The puppy held the veteran down tintil
even the most experienced leashmen were
puzzled as to who would be the winner.
Swinnerton finally won. but by a narrow
margin. Phoebe Is Ptill in the puppy
Class, but with more experience she will
make a great dog. Trlnkett defeated
Leonora at 7 to z and Palmer Hill beat
Las Palmas at ft to ?>.
False Flatterer and Moondyne are selling
even to win tht- stake to-day, but there is
some fear felt that Hot Stuff will do the
trick. Mtalmo Is also favored, but since
her surprising defeat the talent is play
ing wiry.

.;â¢; Frank Chrosman will not rind it an easy
:. matter to establish his defense of insan
â  ity when his trial is called.
'â¢â¢ -Miss Etta Payne, with whom Cheesman
was I, Is still suffering, at the
Lying Hospital from a bullet wound
inflicted by her would-be lover. She is as
yet unable to move, but the ri
â¢that in all probability the girl will be re
â  moved to her home some time next
. : ' The time for Chessman's trial will be set
.-.next Mon itta Payne will be the
'â¢'. most Important witness. The girl scoffs
.'at the idea that Cheesman (s insane, and
.-. says that she will avenge her father's
cruel murder.
:â â â  "I feel sure that my father's murde.ror
â¢. .will get his Just punishment," said the
. -utifortunate fe-irl to-day. "Cheesman may
I'pljLy all the crazy-man he pleases, but
isider him just as sane as anybody.
; When 1 first met him it was at our Elm;
.â  hurst home last M
â¢ ..' ."Oh. no, I never loved him: but I con
fess that I did make him believe in the
â  beginning that I might marry him some
â â : : dv*y. We had not gone together much
..before I heard that Cheesman was cruel
â¢..to his mother; and that he had once been
;â â¢. i:i an insane asylum. Of course, this was
I--B.U a. great surprise to me, and !
:. to think that I had better not go with
:'hi.m any more. I never intended to marry
: him anyway, but the next time 1 saw him
I spoke to him about It.
''Frank Cheesman told me that it was
true he had been in an asylum, He said
, .he had called for a drink in a saloon' one
â  liny and when the bartender demanded
..." Fi;j.y he shot him; and to save himself
:. â  Rom being- sent to San Que'ntin his folks
: . : had him Bent to an insane asylum.
. â¢ -.."This was enough for me, and L re
â  ga'rried him thereafter as an unworthy
- man and refused to go with him. He had
";-. several times told me if he aver caught
. -jne out with any other gentleman on the
' .'"'street- he would shoot me, but I never
/â¢'â¢had any fear of him. He vas the first
man I ever went with, for there were but
ijew."men at Elmhurst.
â  "{.guess he really loved me. One night
he' came around to â  our house in Klmhurpt
..and refused to leave. So he . stood out
' ' by the fence until 2 o'clock in the morn
: "fli*,'. smoking cigarettes. He must have
.;â¢ b'-fen drinking. Anyway that was the
â  time my father had him arrested for dis
â ' turWng- the pea My father forbade me
â porng with him thereafter, but 1 went
" : -w3th him a few times mores.
â  ; : . Gheesman always talked rationally to
.. me: 1 never, believed him Insane, even
- : after he admitted that -he had been in
.van-asylum, and I do not consider him in
â . .sane now. Only last Saturday he told
â â -. me. he'd shoot me if he caught me walk
,': ing with any one else, but 1 wasn't afraid
. -.and- when I wrote him the letter of July
â .'.'2s 'l let him down as easy as possible
-. .His only motive for killing my father
.was revenge."
â¢> .Mrs. JoÃie Brooke, the girl's step
brother, was amused over the idea that
, Cheesman had accidentally shot her in
Â his. effort to fire another bullet into the
' prostrate body of her husband on the
â¢.eventful night.
". : . VI haven't the slightest doubf that
....Cheesman wanted to kill me." she said
..â â¢â¢"'I. was the one he was maddest about'
â¢.. for .1 had frequently ordered him away
.â  .-from the house.
('.â  "Cheesman had shot again at my hus-
V .band after the latter had fallen on the
.... kitchen floor, and he then turned around
â¢ â  and shot directly at m*Â». He told us once
.â â¢ that he had been in an asylum to avoid
-â â¢'the penitentiary."
,'. Since the murder it has been asserted
;-.by-.:some that Frank Cheepman and Etta
â  Payne had been married by contract
' some two months ago. This idea, it was
. claimed, was moreover supported by the
: . -letter from Clara Payne ' which " was
y ..found among Cheesman's possessions, and
â â¢_â  in; which Clara designated herself as
;.â¢'â¢ 'â ' your sister-in-law."
â â¢"â¢.". .This alleged marriage is emphatically
.-. denied . by Etta and her mother.. They
â¢â ;â¢â¢â¢ haVe lately received a letter from Clara
â .. dated- at Sams Valley, Jackson County,
.'â¢'â¢Oregon, August Bth, in which this girl
â V .shows that "she had heard nothing of
..the â  shooting as yet, but she wrote
â . : ".What kind of a man is Frank Cheea
.â¢':nian? He ."aid in a letter that he would
â¢ : -send me a ticket if I would agree to
â â :;<>bttie down to Oakland and be his friend.
.;â  I '.doh.'.t know what he means."
'".â¢â¢'â¢Sirs. Brooke says that when Cheesman
'. learned of Etta having a sister he wrote
' â¢'â¢to her and signed as "your brother-in
"-. law."
â¢â¢ ' '."Clara is a mere girl, and in good hu
:. v.mor answered the letter, signing her
â¢;."â  self as his sister-in-law," said Mrs.
Brooke. "Etta and Cheesman were not to
â¢'.--.â¢be/ married, and it was all* Cheesman's
..-.lde.a~ :Indeed, I do not think him insane;
â .-.. in fact, he told me that he had oncd
../I tpade people believe him crazy, but he
' -.' bad- fooled them. Ido think, though,
that he is the most dangerous man in
â¢ this .community, and the sooner he Is
. out of existence the better for the world.

else. The opera-house has been laid out
on lines recommended by experienced the
atrical men. and it is as good as any the
ater between San Francisco and San Jose,
with perhaps one exception. We have aJ
rtady booked several companies, ana this
ilone is sufficient proof that theat
rical managers believe this to be a fruit
ful Held. Occasionally an effort will be
made to bring oot a star. This., part or

One of the most Impressive funerals
ever conducted in thla county was that
of the late Rev. John MeKvoy, whose

nearly a quarter of ;i century the parish
priest of the San Leandro and Haywarda
district and the pastor of the Church of
St. Leander in the little town of San

Archbishop Riordan conducted the cere
monies, which were attended by a large
concourse of the clergy and friends.
Every family for miles around was rep
resented and was anxious to testify per-
I sonally to the bond of spiritual friendship
that has been built up during twenty-four
years.
One of the latest requests of Father Mc-
Bvoy was that his remains should be de
posited in the same little plat on the hlll
! side where he bad burled many of his
I flock. When the news of his death
i. ached his family in the Bast they re
â¢ quested that the remains be sent to them
for burial in the family plat at Jersey City
i Heights, N. J. But the priest's Last wishes
i were obeyed.
In the little church, while the features
! of the dead priest were exposed, hun
dreds passed around the casket, and after
ward went to the cemetery in the foot
hills Everybody brought a floral tribute
and many o"f the offerings were exquisite.
Archbishop Kiordan delivered an elo
quent eulogy over the remains of the
deceased, and spoke of the persistent, and
progressive work carried out by Father
McEvoy In his large parish. Rev. bather
Santos, the assistant pastor of the church,
was the celebrant at the requiem high
mass, the deacon being Rev. J. J. Cran
well of St. Mary's College, the subdeacon

himself in the eyes of the present genera

field, where honor is to be had at the
cannon's mouth, has made his idle mo
ments in this time of war well nigh un
bearable;. Every day would bring with it
a letter from somebody or uther from
every place on the map, soliciting the
Colonel's service in a regiment then In
process of formation. The climax came
a few days ago, and now the great fighter
of a few decades ago Is rejoicing th>_- war
Is over. This is ail due to the last letter
he received. It was written by an honor
mad civilian of Portland, and in it he
begs most tearfully that the colonel will
"accept the rank of major in the regi
ment which he is forming, and if you do
that, why I know the Government will
gladly accept the regiment." Three timeÃ
did the civil fighter read that letter, and
three several times did he curse in a
multi-colored style. "If that man could
murder Spaniards," was his conclusive
judgment, "as he murders the King's
English, why, there wouldn't be an enemy
of this country in Christendom In twenty
four hours."

played yesterday afternoon before a
large crowd. The tournament was not
concluded owing to the late hour at
which the play began.
In the first match Colonel I-inderman

and R. J. Davis. Whitney played a
splendid net game, while Stauf did some
good work In the back court. The sec

the match. 6â4.6 â 4.

the married miner? and their families.
The flames spread very rapidly and be

houses were burned. All the inmates
escaped injury, but much of their furni

The fire was caused by a small boy
who was playing with matches and the
flames had obtained a ii.-m hold of the
house before its seriousness. was reaped.
The alarm was given and hundreds nt
miners were summoned by the lire sell to
fight the. flames, and the apparatus a.

was a stiff breeze blowing air.l th'_- names
went from one house to another witfi re
markable rapidity until one whole row
of six houses was entirely consumed.
The loss will fall heavily on the miners
and the company, as there was no in

BATEMAN MAKING
A BLUFF AT WORK
HAS INCKEASED THE FORCE ON
THE HALL OF JUSTICE.
But the Additional Workmen Seem to
Be There Simply to Show
Themselves.
For the past three days Batsman Bros,
have been making a big bluff at doing:
something:' on the Hall of Justice. The
gang of spider hunters which worked so
zealously In the early part of the week
discarded their brooms and set to work
clearing away the rubbish from the site of
the old Morgue. What the object is in hav
ing this done is hard to determine, as the
question of final disposition of this por
tion of the edifice has never yet been set
tled. According to the contract, the up
per stories of the old Morgue building
were to be demolished and a new struct
ure erected on the old foundations. It
was found, however, that the foundations
were not strong onough to support a new
building, and the matter has since been
held In abeyance.
In order to hoodwink disgusted prop
erty-owners into believing that some
thing was really being done about thÂ»
building a gang of men were set to work,
keeping themselves busy In any old way.
about the Morgue site, and the gate was
carefully left wide open, so they could bt;
seen by all passersby.
Bateman has always contended that
work was progressing rapidly on the in
terior of the building, and that taxpayers
"set up a howl" because they did not Bee
the outer walls going up. The howl has
evidently annoyed the dilatory contractor
more than ho cares to admit, as yesterday
he put a gang on the outer walls. Along
Kearny and Merchant streets they busied
themselves clearing away loose stone
and mortar, evidently in preparation for
the reception of the longr-expected terra
cotta. A gang of masons was also put to
work laying brick on the rear of the
building, which might have been laid a
year ago: That all this bustle Is simply
being made for effect Is clearly shown
when it Is taken into consideration that
It Is all work which could have been done
at any time since the building. was start

on the roof and-'clopk' tower next week,
"unless' something 'unforeseen occurs."

already that little credence is put in his
promises, '- ' . ~>

The State Medical Institute Discovers a
Remarkable Remedy for Lost
Vigor.
ARE SENDING FREE A TRIAL PACKAGE
TO ALL WHO WRITE.
Free samples of a most remarkable
remedy are being distributed by the State
Medical Institute, Fort Wayne, Ind. It
cured so many men who had battled for
years against the mental and physical
suffering of lost manhood that the insti-
tute has decided to distribute free trial
packages to all who write. It is a home
treatment and all men who suffer with
any form of Bexual weakness resultfng
from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
celf, or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where it is needed.
It cures all the ills and troubles that
come from years of misuse of the natural
functions and has been an absolute suc-
cess in all cases. A request to the State
Medical Institute, 193 First National Bank
Building, Fort Wayne, Ind.. stating that
you desire one of their free trial pack-
ages will be complied with. The institute
is desirous of reaching that great class
of men who are unable to leave home to
be treated and the free sample will en-
able them to see how . eayy it is to be
cured of sexual weakness when the
proper remedies are employed. The in-
stitute makes no restrictions. Any man
who writes will be sent a free sample,
carefully sealed in a plain package so
that its recipient need have no fear of
embarrassment or publicity. Readers are
requested to write without delay.

Alleged Fraud in the
Police Alarm.
BUT ONE BID CONSIDERED
NEW SYSTEM WXLL BE THE
SAME AS AT PRESENT.
The $35,000 Appropriated Is to Be
Expended Simply for New Alarm
Boxes and Elaborate
Switchboards.
Is the Gamewell Police Alarm system,
which has mot with favor before the
Board of Supervisors, the most efficient
that can 'be procured fur the various needs
of the Police Department in communicat
ing from the officers on the streets to
those in charge of the various prisons?
This is a question 1 that seems to involve
a division of opinion between the Super
visors, the Gamewell Company and the.
City Electrician on the one side and the
Hughes Company on the other, the lat
ter maintaining that there are various de
fects in the Gamewell system which it has
overcome in many ways. In addition to
this Improvement the rival company
claims to possess a number of additional
inventions for decreasing the amount of
time and the trouble with which the police
officer on duty in the streets has now
to contend. With the use of the ven
trilophone, lately invented by A. C. Rob
bins, the well-known electrician of the
Automatic Fire .Alarm Company, it would
be unnecessary for the officer on duty to
take the telephone receiver from the hook
in the alarm box in signaling to the sta
tion for assistance. His only duty would
be to turn the key in the box and the
door, which works upon a spring, the
moving of which sounds the alarm in the
station, the answer being sent back from
the officer on duty in the prison through
the ventrilophone, thereby rendering it ab-
solutely unnecessary for the officer in the
street to attend to anything but his duty
in holding his prisoner until the neces
sary aid arrives.
By this system, which has been proven
a feasible one, it would undoubtedly be to
the advantage of the city and to the
Police Department to adopt it. Itut this
the Supervisors have refused to do, and
have absolutely ignored the request that
the machine be investigated as to its
merits or demerits. The Hughes Com
pany claims that it has not received a
chance to bid owing to the trickery of
the Supervisors in prohibiting its ma.chinu
being submitted in its entirety for com
plete examiiiaiic.n before the board.
The "new" Gamewell system, after the
$35,000 appropriation has been expend)
the city in the expectation of getting
something new will he identical with the
old with the difference that the city will
have elaborately constructed and nicely
painted boxes for its citizens to look upon,
with no improvement as to interior i lec
trical mechanism for facilitating the send
ing and receiving of signals. The general
impression of the public is that if the
city is going to expend $35,000 t<> make
an Improvement in the present system it
should endeavor to get something in re
turn for the money in the way of better
facility and not merely an Improvement
in the shape and design of the alarm box
and various .switchboards.
The Hughes Company declares that it
has been deprived from bidding for the
reason that In the original resolution
adopted by the Board of Supervisors a
clause was inserted demanding that in
the sample machines presented the tele
phone must be omitted. Under this re
striction it was Impossible for the com
pany to contend with the Gamewell, as it
would be absurd to attempt to give a
practical demonstration of the new in
vention without explaining it in detail,

would prevent. The use of the ventrilo
phone, unless properly explained in con
junction with the telephone, could not
be readily seen or intelligibly understood
by those unacquainted with the workings
of the new invention. The company
claims that the restriction in the matter
of telephones was made simply to ex
clude it from obtaining a proper examina
tion of the new system and fpr tne pur
pose of affording an excuse for the Board
of Supervisors to make another appropri
ation after the $35,000 1f expended In sup
plying the alarm boxes with telephones.
This accusation is denied by City Elec
trician W. R. Hewitt. He claims that
the new boxes will be equipped with tele
phones without any additional expense to
the city other than the usual rental
which is now paid for the use of the in
struments.
That It is possible to buy machines out
riKht that will be as efficient as the pres
ent telephones now in use is denied by
Hewitt. He asserts that it is impossible
to buy any of the telephones now used
in the alarm system, and to tolerate a
substitution would mean absolute failure.
Although Hewitt's knowledge of elec
tricity Ifl somewhat keen and far above
the ordinary, the Supervisors are liable
to dispense with his opinion an<l use th.ir
own judgment, which will undoubtedly
mean an additional expense to the city
in supplying the new boxes with tele
phones.
Hewitt favors the Gamewell system and
condemns all others on the argument that
innovation is dangerous and therefore
sin mid not be tolerated even as far as
making a casual inspection. The Hughes
system should not. in his estimation, be
given a fair trial. He laughs at the idea
of there being anything more perfect than
his pet Qamewell toy. Any improvement
on this system to him seems an impossi-
I'iliTv. although from his knowledge of
the Hughes invention he is not capable of
condemning ft. having given it but a hasty
inspection and being totally Ignorant of
the various Improvements which it incor
porates. He knows neither the basis upon
which it is operated nor the extent of its
power. He cannot even cite the various
faults which he claims it possesses, al
though asked to do so as an Â«'xplanation
on which to base his condemnation of It.
Everything in it to him is a failure, with
out a proper examination. It has no mer
its :md possesses every fault. He pays
that the inventor of the Hughes system
in introducing the double balance action
for making his system work perfectly
both ways is an imitator of the Holmes
burglar alarm system.
These are the principal reasons why the
Board of Supervisors has favored' the
Gamewell system and condemned the
Hughes at the recommendation of the
City Electrician, who. from his expressed
knowledge of the latter, knows absolutely
nothing about its prevailing features or
its value as a perfect alarm system.
The managers of the Hughes invention
have offered to establish the entire sys
tem, including every detail incorporated^
In the Gamewell, such as boxes, etc, in
addition to telephones, ventrilophones and
improved electrical appartus for lessening
the work and inconvenience now involved
for J25.000.
"Whether the original contract of $.15,000
for new boxes will be set aside until a
proper examination of the Hughes system
is made is a matter of coniecture.

REMARKABLE GROWTH OF
BUiLDING AND LOAN
ASSOCIATIONS OF THIS STATE
Interesting Facts and Figures Re
garding Their Work as Home
Builders and Makers.
California industries of all kinds have
had somewhat of a phenomenal devel
opment from small beginnings. They
have in many directions grown to co
lossal proportions.
The Call finds this strikingly true of
Building and Loan Associations in
this State.
During the past year over 1200 new
houses of various sizes have been
erected by the agency of these asso
ciations. There are 153 of these Build
ing and Loan Associations in the State
which have thus contributed to the en
largement of our material interests on
the line of real estate investments. The
Continental Building and Loan Asso
ciation, 222 Sansome street, has an en
viable record in this direction, having
been instrumental in erecting over one
eighth of all the dwellings erected in
the State during the past twelve
months by these associations. These
structures are .ill gratifying additions
to the dwellings of this State and some
of them are architectural beauties.
These associations are Inportffnt fac
tors in the question of progress, because
they are the only institutions in the
world whose controlling thought and
dominating purpose is to make it pos
sible for all people to acquire homes of
their own, and thus become freehold
ers instead of renters.
The Continental Building and Loan
Association of this city is splendidly
equipped for service in behalf of the
people, as it has a subscribed capital
of $7,000,000, a paid-up capital of $1,000,
000, and a monthly income of $75,000.
In the business circles of this State
the Continental Building and Loan As
sociation is recognized and acknowl
edged as the leading organization of
its kind. It is pre-eminent and its
success is simply marvelous. In addi
tion to the homes built by them the
Continental has made during the past
year 271 loans to parties wishing to im
prove their property or remove exist
ing incumbrances.
Statistics are not generally consid
ered as Interesting reading, but in con
nection with this association they tell
the story of thrift and enterprise on
the part of the people, who are ever
seeking to advance their interests and
secure to themselves homes which they
can call their own. Without the aid
and co-operation of some such agency
as the Continental Building and Loan
Association this would have been im
possible for many people who are own
ers of happy homes to-day.
There are hundreds of families abid
ing in happy homes which they own
and which have been secured to them
through the loan department of this as
sociation. These loans are promptly
made and upon the most favorable con
ditions. They are not alone in the
interests of the association, but con
serve the best interests of the parties
who desire to erect dwellings of their
own. The terms upon which these
loans are made are such that every
man who desires to build and is will
ing and able to work can do so* profit
ably. All well conducted Building and
Loan Associations are friends of the
people Inasmuch as they are home
makers and it is the duty of all par
ents to provide a home for their chil
dren.

BUDD WILL BE THERE.
The Governor Has Accepted the Invi
tation to Be Present at the
Irish Fair.
A communication from Governor Budd
was received yesterday by the entertain
ment committee of the Irish Fair stating
that the invitation to be present at the
fair on Governor's Day, Saturday, Sep
tember 3, was accepted and that he and
his entire staff would be present on the
day mentioned.
By unanimous concurrence the man
agement of the coming fair decided to
*: ltld . r . aw . from sale the $1 coupon tickets
that the ladies have been selling. As tn e
regular admission will be 25 cents it was
thought that it would decrease the sale of
the regular tickets.
One of the most important exhibits that
has been loaned to the Irish Fair has
come from Port Costa from C. Murphy
It is ten large pictures which will be of
f^'t 1 J, nttrâ¬ - S t to not only students of
Irish history, but to the general public
Ih.'y embrace "The Tara Broach," "The
Cross of Cong," "The Chalice of Ar
dagh, "The Shrine of St. Patrick." "The
Crosier of Clonmacnois," "The Shrine of
Molaise, "The Shrine of Moling "
Another famous relic is the .shrine in
which was preserved the copy of the
gospels used by St. Patrick himself which
are now in the museum of Dublin.
One of the best points of interest in
the exposition will no doubt be the in
dustrial department, where Mr. Hilton
and the silk looms in charge of Miss
Amy la Martin will turn out silk hand^
kercniefs with the motto of the fair
shamrocks â on them in green for the
benefit of the fund.

partment next Monday.

Astonishing Way in Which the Rev. F. F. Jernegan Originated and Promoted a Scheme for Extracting Gold From Sea Water and How He Fooled His Rich Dupes by Substitutmg baited Keturns
in the Experiments.
PRETENDED TO EXTRACT
GOLD
FROM SEA WATER.
A Diver Fixed the "Returns" While Rich
Dupes Waited Above for Them.
the Swindlers Were Clearing Up Hundreds of
Thousands of Dollars When They
Were Discovered.
STORY OF ONE OF THE MEN WHO WORKED WITH THEM.
i-n HE New York Herald has just laid before the public the details of
'â 'â  I one of the most remarkable swindles in history. For several days the
I shrewd financial operations of the Rev. P. F. Jernegan, under the pre
â  I tense of abstracting gold from sea water, and his flight upon exposure,
. have divided attention with the news from the seat of war. The
â¢ease with which the reverend gentleman found dupes was astonishing. He
; â ". not only took gold from their pockets, but he caused them to draw it out
of their banks and give it to him. Then he sent it to the Lmted States
- Assayer's office, quietly turned it into bank notes and securities then quick
â¢ ly fled abroad leaving the country amazed at the ease with which he did it.
Like the electric sugar refining scheme and the Keeley motor, its sue
â¢ cess was connected with a secret process. Without this secret nothing
. could be done.
How many hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock was sold
by the swindlers is not yet known, but over $350,000 worth Is held in Boston.
The assistant treasurer of the company thinks $900,000 worth of stock had
been disposed of. The stock is now selling at 10 cents a share and the in
vestors will lose nearly everything. Rev. Mr. Jernegan is supposed to be in
France and efforts are being made to arrest and extradite him. The other
originators of the Electrolytic Marine Salt Company, among them another
' minister ' Rev. William Arrington, are trying "to explain" themselves out
Of the matter as best they can. The following story was given the New
â¢ Yrvk Herald by Detective. William Phalen, who was employed by the orig
inal conspirators to hold the safety pipe while Diver Fisher walked under
tlvÂ» water and "salted" the experimenting tanks where "gold was being ex
tracted" from the ocean water. When Phalen learned the nature of the
business he had Joined he refused to have anything more to do with the
swindle ' That was in the early days of the operations. Later the swind
â¢: lers an the road to high success and millions, opened up gorgeous offices
in Hevr York Boston London and other big cities and began the sale of
stock that had netted $900,000 when the swindle fell to pieces.
â pbpyrlghted. 1838. by^Jaines Gordon Bennett.
IN September, 1896, I received a let
ter from. C. E. Fisher, at Deland
Fla., in regard to a scheme* he had
on foot. He was a diver by pro
fusion, but had been a floorwalker
in a Brooklyn dry goods store.

a process for making money out of the

I'â¢ In a day or two, on returning to

khat the Niantic people had become
â¢ suspicious and they proposed to naova
tlieir works to Rhode Island. Follow
ing- the announcement came a. second
The Call Sunday Edition
letter from Fisher, dated Providence.
He wanted me to join him there and
assist in sorao important experiments
about to take place connected with
their great scheme for making gold.
As he explained it, there was some div
ing to be done and a life line to be held
in the water. It was so important
that only a man in whom he had im
plicit trust would be allowed to do the
work. He offered to pay my expenses
and reimburse me for outlays, regard
less of what they were, so I went to
Providence.
On reaching Providence Fisher fur
ther explained that I was to go down
the bay a mile or so to a point where
their experiments were to be made and
begin operations. To conceal the pur
pose of his operations, notwithstanding
all that he had, hinted about their in
tention of producing gold he declared
they were only to make a geographi
cal survey. It would be necessary to
do some diving to get the exact con
figuration of the bottom of the bay.
I naturally believed this statement. I
found that my duties were to help him
(Fisher) put on his armor and then
hold the life line while he made his
dive. He remained under from a half
to three-quarters of an hour at a time.
It should be explained that Jernegan
was also there on the scene. Although
â¢he was exceedingly active in flying
around the country in all directions, he
was still mysterious and evasiveâal
ways hinting at great fortunes, but
never explaining.
I understood that we were to gf ; t
things ready for Ryan, the Middletown
jeweler and capitalist, and also Pier

put up money. Hence the necessity
of hay-ing things ready for making- the
experiments perfect. The idea was io
paralyze them and produce gold from
sea water there before their eyes.
One evening, after a day of experi
ments, we cross Narragansett Bay
and began to make soundings from a
little rocky Island to a wharf on shore
not far distant. The soundings showed
the depth of water between the wharf
and the island to be from seven to nine
feet. An insulated wire or cable was
laid along the bottom, connecting the
wharf with the island. "When we were
oh the island I discovered that Fisher's
plan was to follow the wira under water
and by the aid of his diving suit reach
the wharf, where he was to manipulate
some of the apparatus at the bottom
of the bay against the wharf.
I also discovered that a little Bxlo
house of boards had been constructed
on the end of the wharf for Jernegan's
use In ma.king the alleged geographical,
survey. Thar is the way he explained 1
it. Fisher was successful in following
the wire to and from the bottom of the
wharf, under water, even without a
lifeline, I remaining on the Island un
til he made the trip. As I remember
he was not absent more than ten or
fifteen minutes.
"What are you up to, anyway?" I
exclaimed, as he came out of the water
In his diving suit, surmounted by a
tank of compressed air, which he wore
on his back.
Greatly elated at the success of his
submarine trip he exclaimed:
"We are going: to make gold. Jerne
gan is to have two men here. They
will stay in that hut on the wharf over
night and vatch the process. There is
a fortune in it for us. It will .3tonish
the world. These capitalists arc* eoing
to furnish their own chemicals and
place them in the water themselves,
while Jernegan will supply the battery
connected with the submarine recepta
cle for getting gold from the sea."
He further explained that platinum
wires were connected with the appa
ratus making it easy to abstract the
gold from the surrounding salt water,
which held the precious metal in solu
tion. It all seemed marvelous. At first
I could scarcely believe the thing pos
sible, but on further explanation the
operation appeared simple and plausi
ble.
On the following day the capitalists
. arrived, registered at the City Hotel
in Providence . : .d that' afternoon they
went to the wharf, where they re
mained over night in the little house.
The quicksilver which they had brought
with them was deposited in the sub
marine tank before !t was lowered into
the sea. Then the current was turned
on from Jernegan's battery, while .the
capitalists watched the operations,
silently and in wonder. These men sat
there all night waiting in bitter cold
in February for the gold to accumulate
in the box. These confiding gentlemen
â supposed to be shrewd business: men
â when they dropped their own honest
quicksilver into the square lead-lined
box little dreamed that Fisher, the
diver, would come around later walk
ing on the bottom of the sea, and
empty their quicksilver into the water,
replacing it wi f h some doctored mer
cury of his own, well saturated with
gold.
I was told subsequently by Jernegan
himself that on the following morning,
when the submerged box was hoisted
out of the water, It was found that
the mercury had eaten through the lin
ing of the box and some of it had dis
appeared into the sea. Enough, how
ever, remained to show the value of
the alleged experiment. ;^,'-.:
To still further aid the demonstra
tion, Jernegan slipped a little Califor
nia nugget, which he had been wear
ing as a scarf ornament, into the quick
silver,, to be dissolved.
This greatly added to the yield of
gold from the salt water of th\ sea.
The contents of . the box were then
given to an assayer who made his
analysis, while the capitalists waited
in the reception-room.
The . assayer's report made the yield
about $4 â a fairly good night's work
for a little box in the bottom of Nar
ragansett Bay with only an ordinary
battery to do the mining and abstract
the gold from the sea water.
The capitalists were not only: satis
fied, but amazed at the result, and said
they were willing to put up handsomely
for building machinery on a large
scale that would take gold by the car
load out .of the sea. ;
: As the outlook appeared, Aladdin's
lamp and the big diamond mines of the
"Arabian Nights" were not in it with
this little chain lightning gold mining
apparatus invented by the Rev. P. F.
Jernegan. ; Being a good Baptist, he
no doubt could get better results j from
water, either fresh or salt, than any
other living man in that part of . the
country, and he did. \ His process has
satisfied the most -skeptical. ' .;â¢; V <
After congratulations all around -the
capitalists ' returned to ':<. Middletown,
Conn., where they lived, but : we re
mained, v In a i few days along came a
draftâ the amount of the first, install
ment on the payments to be made.
After staying in Providence two or
three days I came to New York, hav
ing done what Fisher had requested in
the way of aiding him In his experi
ments. According to instructions I
sent on my billâ ssoo. Instead of pay
ing it promptly Jerne^an sent me $200
by Fisher. I protested vigorously and
said that I proposed to have the full
amount of my bill. After some delay
it was paid.
I thought the matter over and con
cluded to get out of the business, and I
bo informed Jernegan. He said that
he was sorry , to lpse,me. ; -hoped that.
I would remain, "but my mind was made
up and they couldn't change me.
But the promoters continued to visit
me as usual and still urged me to re
sume operations. They even wanted me
to accompany them to Europe on a
money raising- trip for further promot
ing the scheme, but I declined. I
wanted nothing to do with the affair
in any shape or manner.
JLater the Rev. Mr. Allington, a Bap
tist clergyman of Newburyport. was
persuaded to Join the enterprise and
they sent him abroad to raise funds.
Jernegan soon followed and opened a
laboratory at 75 Gloucester place, Port
man Square, W. London, England. He
operated under the alias of Dr. W. L.
Stanley at that address. This was at
the beginning, of the London season of
last year.
For a time I heard no more of them
until I learned that a gentleman â Mr.
Kilgore, a lawyer, of Boston â had
loaned them $3000. for which he was to
receive 100 per cent interest, payable
semi-annually. In view of the declara
tion that they could take gold out of
the ocean day and night, without labor
or particular expense, this was no more
than for a laboring man to pay 1 per
cent for money.
Another man was duped by the
scheme â the Rev. Mr. Tuller of Ja
maica Plains, Mass. â and induced to in
vest 52000. He was so infatuated with
the prospectus that he even mortgaged
his house to join in the great work of
plunging your hand in the ocean and
pulling cut a fortune.
â¢ I next' learned that the syndicate had
opened offices in Boston, at 53 State
street, and were doing business on a
large scale. They had established works
on an island at North Lubec, .Me. The
report sent abroad was that they were
' taking out gold off the Maine coast by
the . bucketful 1 and sending it through
their bankers, . Messrs. Ladenburg,
. Thalmann & Co. of 40 Wall street, to
the United States / Assay jj Office, . of
which Mr. Torrey is the head. '
The total, representing 515,000 to $20,
000, was sent In various sums from time
to time. But these amounts do not by
any means represent the full amount
of gold sent to the assay office.
This Rev. Mr. Jernegan is a polished
gentleman. He has a classical educa
tion, but he does not talk like a clergy
man. He preaches a beautiful sermon
and has a fine delivery, ; but his con
versation was far from that of a clergy
man during- reek days, when he was
on his- great still hunt for a fortune in
the bottom of the sea. . . Â» : .
It will be observed in his letter to
v Diver Fisher, who was his- old play
mate in Edgartown, that the Rev. Jer
negan had no hesitation in admitting
his manifold shortcomings.. His refer
ence to his lust for gold and -evidently
lust for women, as having been the
vexing problem; of his life,; hints at a
phase of the story.

The way this clerical would-be Monte
Cristo came to abandon his scheme was
this: A certain gentleman, whom he is
alleged to have wronged, requested an ex
planation from both Fisher and himself
regarding certain facts that had been
confessed to that gentleman. Many let
ters, in addition to the telegram, had been
sent also demanding an explanation.
Only one answer was received, and that
came from Fisher, to the effect that he
would be In New York on the 23d or 24th
of July, and that he would meet the gen
tleman referred to and talk the matter
over.
Diver Fisher, who was always success
ful In reaching bottom and tampering
v,lth Jernegan's gold pots In the sea, was
unsuccessful In reaching New York. At
least he did not appear as he promised.
Then the gontleman went Into the elec
tricity business himself, and telegraphed
Fisher a warning that he must appear
or take the consequences. Again he did
not appear. Hence the disclosures.

BOSTON, Aug. 3.â The case of the
missing Mr. Jernegan of the Elec
trolytic Marine Salt Company has been
put into the hands of Chief Inspector
Watts of the Bureau of Criminal In
vestigation and Melvin O. Adams has
been retained as counsel by the stock
* holders. The Government at Wash
ington has been asked to request the
French Government to detain Jernegan
pending extradition papers.
Now that the works of the Elec
trolytic Marine Salt Company at
Lubec have been closed and the help
paid off and discharged, the stock
holders are beginning to figure on what
they will get out of the amount paid in.
Dr. A. P. Sawyer of Newburyport, as
sistant treasurer, says that about $900,
000 has been paid in. The company has
recovered $23,000 in cash and securities
from Marcus W. Jernegan, who is no%v
in custody of detectives. The Rev. P.
F. Jernegan's sum of $30,000 in a local
bank has been attached.
One of the heavy stockholders in this
city said to-day that 500 shares of stock
were sold in the office of the company

Men with wheels in their head are of
a mechanical turn of mind.
WOMEN WHO WERE FAMOUS SOLDIERS
THE spirit of the Amazons does not
survive only in the women war
riors of Dahomey. The Sun re
cently published a story about wo
men who enlisted and fought in
the civil war; and other countries, also,
have their women soldiers. The Cubans
have had several women soldiers, who
could ride and shoot and use a ma
chete; and the most romantic figure in
the recent Brazilian rebellion was Ma
ria Barbosa, who, with sword and cru
cifix in hand, led the rebels against the
Government troops. The story goes
that this modern Joan of Arc fell asleep
in a church one day and saw a vision
which commanded her to lead her
townsmen against the Government post
of Bon Jardin. She gathered a band of
followers who believed in her revela
tion, captured Bon Jardin, where many
of the citizens joined her forces, and
went on to Soa Joao, where she took the
town and killed hundreds of Republi
cans. Her beauty and ferocious cour
age made her the idol of her followers.
Another woman warrior of to-day, is
Josephine Rizal, one of the leaders of
the rebellion against Spain in the Phil
ippines. She was married at 20, and
when she had been a bride for only one
hour her husband was executed before
her eyes by the Spanish. The deed
aroused widespread excitement, and
â was one of the causes that led to the
assassination of Canovas, the Spanish
Prime Minister. The frenzied young
widow swore that she would avenge
her husband's murder, and that Span
ish lives by the score should pay for his
life. She went to Aguinaldo at rebel
headquarters and requested permission
to enter the ranks, which was granted,
and from the first she fought with a
reckless dash and courage that made
her conspicuous in every engagement.
At last she fell into the hands of Gen
eral Primo de Rivera, who, in recogni
tion of her bravery, released her. Later
he repented his chivalrous generosity,
and Spanish soldiers were sent to fol
low and capture her, but through the
warning and assistance of friends she
escaped to Hongkong.
The Graeco-Turkish war also had its
heroine, a Greek woman who incited
the natives of her province to revolt
and led them in a number of their skir
mishes.
During the Tai Ping- rebellion in Chi
na in ISSO an army of women was com
manded by woman officers.
Earlier centuries furnish still more
examples of the woman soldier, and
the records of Europe cite striking ex
amples of woman's heroism in battle.
Rnse Lacombe. the actress, and the
beautiful /Theroigne de Mericourt were
conspicuous figures in the battles of the
French Revolution, and Renee Borde
reau, the heroine of the Vendee, fought
in more than 200 battles. Forty-two
members of her family were killed in
the revolution and her father was cut
down by her side. In one encounter at
a bridge she resisted and defeated with
her own hand twenty-one of her ene
mies. Napoleon so feared the zeal and
influence of La Bordereau that when he
subdued the Vendee he refused to par
don her and threw her into prison; but
she was released after the fall of the
Empire.
Another French woman, Mary Sche
lienck, fought in the armies of Napo
leon, and so signally distinguished her
self on the field of Austcrlitz that Na
poleon decorated her with the Cross of
the Legion of Honor, and, later, grant
ed her a large pension.
English soldier heroines are legion.
Christina Davis is one of the most fa
mous. She entered the English army
in order to find her husband, who had
been carried off by a press gang. In
her first battle she was wounded in
the foot and laid up for two months,
but the secret of her sex was not dis
covered. No sooner did she join her
regiment in Holland than she was cap
tured by the French, and, when ex
changed for French prisoners, ill luck
still followed her. The daughter of a
wealthy burgher fell in love with the
disguised soldier, and Christina was
forced into a duel with the sergeant of
her own regiment, who happened to be
devoted to the Dutch maiden. The
sergeant was badly wounded and the
young soldier imprisoned, but she was
finally released; and after that things
went more smoothly for her. She
Joined the cavalry and followed Marl
borough, winning the admiration of
all her regiment; but at Ramillies she
was wounded and the news that she
was a woman spread abroad. She was
the toast of all the army and every
honor was paid her. Her husband was
found and brought to her and the regi
ment gave them a new wedding, after
which the officers claimed the privilege
of kissing the bride, and her comrades
of the ranks shouted themselves hoarse.
Her devotion to her leader and his
cause influenced her to remain in the
army until the end of the compaign,
and she and her husband fought side
by side until he was killed at Malpla
quet. Then the wife retired and re
ceived a pension from the Queen; but
at the funeral of the Duke of Marl
borough she rejoined her regiment and
marched behind the coffin, with tears
streaming down her cheeks. At her
own funeral she and her old comrades
met once more and they buried her
with military honors.
Hannah Snell was another English
girl who enlisted in order to follow her
husband. She, too, made herself fa
mous for deeds of valor. At the siege
of Pondicherry she led the troopers in
fording a stream running breast high,
and in the very face of the French bat
teries; and, in another siege, she fought
for seven successive days and nights
in trenches waist deep in water. In
one engagement she received twelve
wounds, but obtained the help of a
peasant woman and attended to her
own wounds in order to avoid the dis
covery of her sex. Finally, she learned
that the husband for whom she was
searching was dead, and then she ac
knowledged her disguise and left tha
army.
Mary Ambree headed 1000 English
men, who fought for seven hours
against 3000 Spanish soldiers, and when
ordered to withdraw her troops lingered
behind and sent a letter offering to
fight single-handed any three Spaniards
who icould meet her.

Was This Strange Manuscript Written by Moses?
Very Remarkable
JTebrew Antiquities
Ilnearthed in
{Palestine.
BERLIN, Aug. 10.â For several years a German preacher from the town
of "Walbroel has been at work, personally and through tiative agents, in
collecting ancient manuscripts and coins from the excavations in Pales
tine. The preacher's name is Bruesselbach and he has Just published
a little monograph giving the results of his labors. The publication has
attracted wide attention among archaeologists and scientific men, for the rea
son that the discoveries which Bruesselbach claims to have made and which
seem to be authenticated by the facts are the moat important made in many
years. The finds possess other than scholarly interest, as they nearly all relate
to Bible history.
The most important of the discoveries related by Bruesselbacn is that of a
manuscript supposedly written by Moses himself. The margin bears the name
of Moses and the writing relates to the subjects treated in the early books of
the Bible which have come down to us as the books of Moses, lr the explorer
can prove the accuracy of his belief in the august authorship of the manu
script which he has unearthed It will be studied with interest as one of the
oldest and probably the most valuable specimen of early writing in existence.
Tne fragment is remarkably well preserved and appears to be made from
the skin of some aquatic animal, probably the hippopotamus or Nile-horse.
It is a yellowish brown in color, crinkled and dry with age. The three drawings
on it are done in black ink, and, ac interpreted -by the discoverer, apparently
refer to the labors of the enslaved Israelites in Egypt.
The Bible story runs (Exodus i, 11-14): "They (the Egyptians) set over
them (the Israelites) taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they
built for Pharaoh store cities, Plthom and Raamsas. And the Egyptians made
the children of Israel to serve with rigor. And they made their lives bitter
with hard bondage in mortar and in brick and in all manner of service In the
field."
The first picture on the recovered manuscript shows a Jewish maiden
milking a cow, referring to the labors with flocks and herds. Above is a pack
OTHER VALUABLE ANTIQUITIES FOUND IN THE EXCAVATION
Another coin brought to light is evidently to be located about 175
B. C. in the time of the king priest, Jason. The inscription is in a
peculiar dialect of Syro-Aramaic belonging to that period, and is writ
ten from left to right, contrary to the Hebrew custom in writing.
The decipherment of the inscription is "K. Jehason G. Is. Coin of the
City," which has been translated: "Jason, the high priest (Kohen Ge
dol) of Israel." On the reserve is a palm branch and a smoking altar,
illustrating the priestly function of offering sacrifices in the temple.
A seal ring, bearing the name of Simeon, the Maccabee, who ruled
143-135 B. C, was among the other discoveries. The inscription is
most distinct of all, being the most recent, and is therefore more eas
ily read than the others. The letters are arranged around a seven
pointed star and run: "Simeon, the High Priest."
saddle with its two girths, a reference to the work of transport. There Is also
an Egyptian eagle drawn exactly as it is found on the Egyptian monuments.
The second picture is that of two Israelites holding up a large winnowing
frame, in illustration of their labors in the state granaries established, by
Joseph. The Semitic type of the two men is characteristic and unmistakable.
The third picture is that of the foot of a pyramid or the base of a fortification
wall, a specimen of the labor of brickmaking and building, in which the captives
were employed. Upon the column is perched a hawk, the hawk and eagle
being sister symbols of upper and lower Egypt.
While the pictures are interesting, the most important part of the papyrus
is the inscription across the top. It is written in ancient script, hitherto un
known, but so primitive as to approach very closely to the hieroglyphic stage.
It is translated by the discoverer: "Their yearning for freedom irom the op
pressor is full; their long continued sins cry unto thee, O God."
Whether or not the interpretation is accurate the sentiment Is a proper
one to emanate from him who succeeded in giving the Israelites their desired
freedom.
The first five books of the Bible have always been known as "The Five
.Books of Moses." According to the history of Josephus, the original manu
script of these, in the handwriting of Moses, was preserved in the Temple at
Jerusalem. The fragment in the possession of Dr. Bruesselbach was unearthed
from the ruins of the ancient city, 1 nown in the Bible as Lachlsh. The
explorer explains the transition by saying that when the temple and city of
Jerusalem were destroyed by the Romans (70 A. D.) these and other treasures
were buried and later removed to the city of Lachish, where many scholars
had taken up their residence. The ruins of this city have only lately been

SOME QUEER v \
LEGACIES.
Here are some amusing particulars
of legacies with strange conditions at
tached, as given by the Brooklyn Citi
zen. Early last year a peculiar pro
bate suit, involving some $500,000, was
imminent, the disinherited relations
â wishing to upset an old gentleman's
will because he had left the sum named
to found and endow a church on the
condition that every Sunday before the
service the whole of the thirty-nine ar
ticles were to be read by the clergy
man outside the church door.
A strange condition was attached to
the legacy the late Sir Edward Bates,
who died last year, left to his larried
daughter. He stated that he had seen
his son-in-law's Scotch property, and
he considered it would be a gross injury
to his daughter and her children, con
sidering "there are no neighbors within
miles, and there Is no medical man
within six or seven miles," if she lived
there any considerable time. So he ar
ranged that, if his daughter stayed
more than six months in any year, "and
those six months not in the winter," at
that spot, the income derived from the
legacy for the twelve succeeding
months should go to the residuary leg-
atee.
. During this year a gentleman who
died at Mons left a legacy of $3000 to
five friends, the money to be spent on
dinners served in different restaurants,
' and at each meal a certain dish to be
eaten, and a certain wine, of which he
â¢was very fond, to be drunk. Further
more, his memory was to be toasted at
.dessert, the five companions were to
dine in black clothes and gloves, and
enter the room preceded by a flag and
the music of an accordion.
DANGERS WE MAY EXPECT FROM TRADE WITH ORIENT
for many years Senator Teller has roade a study of Asiatic countries and the relation of the silver standard to commercial conditions there. Recently he has considered the possible development of
China under the apportionment among the great nations which Is threatening- Instead of thlnKlng that we are to benefit by the opening of Chinese njarKets to the tradÂ« of the world Mr. Teller balleves that It
would bave been better for us If we had left China In her Isolation.
THE opening up of China has
been a good thing for us up to
this time, but I look for a devel
opment there which may revolu
tionize the manufacturing in
dustries of the world. What we should
have done recently, I believe, was to
say to Russia, "Let China alone. Her
millions of people are content and the
world has nothing to gain by changing
their condition." What will happen to
China now, I think, is that Russia will
step In and get control there and Rus
sianize the Chinese.
Look at the history of Russia and
you will see that she has Russianized
every nation she has conquered. She
fought the Cossacks for fifty years
fought them fiercely â but to-day the
Cossacks are Russians. She Russian
ized them in thirty years. The Govern
ment of China is not unlike the Gov
ernment of Russia. Although Russia
is an autocracy, there is a democracy

REMARKABLE MANUSCRIPT JUST UNEARTHED IN PALESTINE AND BEARING THE SIGNA
TURE Of MOSES.
The ancient manuscript and coins recently discovered by a German preacher in Palestine are considered
among the most important ever brought to light. The most important of the discoveries is that of a man
uscript supposedly written by Moses himself. The margin bears the name of Moses and the writing relates
to the subjects treated in the early books of the Bible which have come down to us as the books of Moses.
If the explorer can prove the accuracy of his belief in the augus^ authorship of the manuscript which he has
unearthed it will be studied with interest as one of the oldest and probably the most valuable specimen of
early writing in existence. The fragment is remarkably well preserved and appears to be made from the skin
of some aquatic animal, probably the hippipotamus or Nile horse. It is a yellowish brown in color, crin
kled and dry with age.

that she will Russianize the people and
show them how to develop their re

not it may be 100 or 200 years before,

When the development of China be

in manufactured goods. I believe that

greater than the. trade of the Atlantic.

Pacific Coast.
I believe that in another decade Apia
.will be doing- most of the manufactur
ing fur th" world. Both the Chinefe
and the Japanese are deft people. They
are not inventive, but they are imita
tive, and the progress they have made
in manufacturing is wonderful. They
can live and thrive on wages that mean
starvation and death to an American
or European laborer. I was talking
some time ago with a missionary who
had just returned from a six years'
stay in China. He told me that it
would not be possible for one who had
not seen them to realize the progress
that the Chinese had made in manu
facturing.
For a little time longer their conser
vatism will keep out foreign machin
ery perhaps. But the war with Japan
made a great awakening in China. This
missionary tells me that the present
Chinese dynasty is doomed. The peo
ple see that it has deceived them and it
is tottering to its fall. With the inau
guration of a new rule changes will
come. The Chinese are a people of fine
business ability. Not the river Chinese
whom we know, but the Chinese of the
Interior. ThlÃ missionary, who had been
to the interior, told me that they were
a fine business race, having splendid
talents in that direction. In fact, he
says j/tiat the most successful business
enterprises in Japan have Chinese at
their head. He says that there is the
difference between the~Chinese and the
Japanese that there is between the
Scotchman and the Parisian. The Par
isian is a dapper fellow, all courtesy
and smiles; the Scotchman is a hard
headed, practical man. So the Chinese
are the superiors of the Japanese as
men of affairs.
With the building of the Nicaragua
canal rates from the Atlantic to the
Pacific will be cheapened to our manu
facturers, and the Nicaragua canal is
going to be built. But I don't know
that it will be an unmixed blessing. If
China's manufactures are to be a com
petitor of all the manufacturing coun
tries of the world the canal will be an
outlet for her products to our Atlantic
coast and to European markets, as well
as a route for sending the products of
European and New England States to
Asia.
China has to-day in abundance every
thing that human needs could demand.

This discovery Bruesselbaeh thinks may solve what has long been a puzzle
to scholars. In all school geographies the origin of the alphabet has been
ascribed to the Phoenicians. Many modern scholars have been inclined to
doubt this theory, for the reason that the letters were not sufficiently primitive.
The inscription just discovered, which is presumably the first specimen extant
of early Hebrew writing, seems to bridge the chasm hitherto existing between
the hieroglyphics and conventional letters of later times.
" Dr. Bruesselbaeh says: The result of our investigation is that the manu
script, judging from all external and internal evidence, is genuinely Mosaic
If this be so the religious world is on the point of some startling discoveries,
for where one manuscript has been found there may be others and the next
one unearthed may contain some portion of the Bible in this ancient script,
thus supporting the tradition of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, or
parts of it at least.
The Palestine Fund reports other interesting discoveries, among them a
coin of earlier date than any heretofore known. The oldest Hebrew coin dis
covored before this time bore date of 143 B. C, and Bruesselbach's party dis
covered a large bronze coin of David's time. It shows the crown of David,
with a circlet of stars. The crown was said, according to story, to be ma^ a
of gold of the value of a talent. The inscription about the coin reads: "David,
King of Jerusalem." On the reverse side is an eight-stringed harp with tna
inscription: "Fear ye, repent ye, who are strong in faith."
Scholars and numismatists alike are exhibiting deep interest In this coin,
which was struck off almost three thousand years ago and passed current
among the subjects of King David in Jerusalem.
Another more notable discovery reported by Dr. Bruesselbaeh is that ot
the "Seal of Solomon." There is no story more clearly remembered by those
who have read the "Arabian Nights" than that of the mystic ring by which,
the genii were summoned to the service of its possessor. Arabic and Hebrew
literature is full of the legends of the wonders performed by the might or.
Solomon's Seal, made through the wisdom of this wisest of monarchs.
The inscription is not so easy to read as those on the coins because of the
peculiar shape of the letters and the fact that they are interwoven with the
MOST ANCIENT HEBREW COIN EVER DISCOVERED.

rarest coins in Hebrew history. Among them was a large bronze coin
of King David's time. It shows the crown of David with a circlet of
stars. The inscription reads: "David, King of Jerusalem." On the
reverse side is an eight-stringed harp with the inscription: "Fear ye,
repent ye, who are strong in faith." This coin is supposed to have
been in circulation 3000 years aero. The oldest Hebrew coin hereto
fore discovered bears date of 143 B. C. Another most notable discov
ery is that of "The Seal of Solomon." The name Solomon has been
deciphered, but the inscription is not easy to read. The evidence so
far goes to show that this is a valuable copy of the great original.
design on the seal. The name of Solomon has been deciphered. If this is thÂ©
genuine seal of Solomon it also has on it "the ineffable name" of God Jehovah,
but Bruesselbach has not been able to make this out to his own satisfaction
amid the various lines traced upon its surface.
Another coin brought to light is evidently to be located about 175 B. C,
in the time of the king-priest, Jason. The inscription is in a peculiar dialect
of Syro-Aramaic belonging to that period and is written from left to right,
contrary to the Hebrew custom in writing. The decipherment of the inscrip
tion Is "K. Jehason G. Is. Coin of the City," which has been translated:
"Jason, the high priest (Kohen Gedol) of Israel." On the reverse Is a palm
branch and a smoking altar, illustrating the priestly function of offering
sacrifices in the temple.
Strictly speaking, Jason is not a Biblical character, for he lived In the
time just following the close of the Biblical period, the accounts of which
are very scanty.
A seal ring, bearing the name of Simeon, the llaccabee, who ruled 143-135
B. C, was among the other discoveries. The inscription is most distinct of all,
being the most recent, and is therefore more easily read than the others. The
letters are arranged around a seven-pointcJ star and run: "Simeon, the High
Priest."
While Dr. Bruesselbach has made no attempt to exploit his discoveries he
claims that there is no doult of their authenticity. At the same time he says
that there is likely to be controversy regarding the genuineness of some of
them and he therefore proposes to place these and other manuscripts. coln3
and ring, which he has dug up, before competent scholars to settle, If possible,
beyond a doubt, the question of their accuracy.
The fact that he has found a manuscript purporting 1 to come from the
hands of Moses, bearing his name and that of Jorhua (his successor) on the
margin, wri:ten in very primitive characters on the most primitive material
ever found, would seem to be important in itself.
But there have been sk ''ul forgeries of such documents before now, and,
until a numher of experts Lave passed u^on the â tter judgment may have to
be suspended. This discovery Is, however, in line with other startling finds of
the past few years.
The unearthing at Nippur of inscriptions which carry civilization back to
five or six thousand years B. C, showing that the art of printing was known
and practiced at that early day, settles one of the objections which has fre
quently been raised against the possibility of Moses having written any part
of the Bl le. the natural doubt as to the use of writing r * that early date.
The discoveries of Dr. Bruesselbach will certainly arouse widespread in

need for it. But when manufacturing
takes a hold in China they will have
this coal supply close at hand and a
vast army of cheap laborers to do their
work. If the Chinese themselves will
not undertake to do manufacturing, the
capitalists of America and England and
Germany will introduce it. How long
would it take you to raise $1,000,-000 for
a manufacturing enterprise in China
among the capitalists of New York If
you could demonstrate that they could
make 20 or 30 per cent on their money?
There is no feeling of patriotism which
would keep the American capitalist
from going into anything which prom-*
ised a profit. I found in Mexico, when
I was there some years ago, that |700,

mill had been put in by a resident of
New York. Machine shops in Monterey
and other places in Mexico have taken
away from Denver the trade in min
ing machinery which we had with Mex
ico for so long a time.
Mexico is now manufacturing all her
own cotton goods, and she is manufac
turing furniture and other things for
home consumption. I was in one of her
cotton mills. It is the most complete,
if not the largest mill in Mexico. All

S.uch a place is West Lynne, on the
â west bank of the Red River of the

The history of the place is one of the

In 1858, just forty years ago, Tulare Lake stretched almost through
two counties of the State, a distance of about eighty- miles. As the land
thereabouts began to be settled up and the streams flowing into it be
gan to be tapped for irrigating purposes its shore line began to shrink.
But never for a moment did any of the settlers believe it would entirely
disappear. Several years ago plans were discussed for building a big
summer resort for San Joaquin Valley residents on its snores. Last
winter's lack of rain, however, completed its story and the dry sum
mer air licked up the last vestige of water that remained to Tulare

Between 1573 and 1880, when vine
yards began to be planted, the waters
shrunk up almost to the borders of
Tulaie County. In 1882 they crossed
it and left Kern County altogether.
Each year after this saw the lake
become smaller and smallejr. It had
become almost circular in shape by
1888, and was quite deep. But it was
doomed. Irrigation became more gen

Were the Scenes of Busy Commercial Life.
THE principal cause of the drying- up of Tulare
Lake is the using of the waters of Kings and Tu
lare rivers for irrigation purposes. The fact
that there have been very few excessively rairy
winters since 1874 has also had a gocd deal to do
with it. Had there been more rainstorms of the kind
that put the greater portion of the San Joaquin and
Sacramento valleys under water several times during
the 60's there would have been more water in the lake
each winter and less needed for irrigation in the sum
mer and the lak 1 ? would probably have been there yet.
In 187S I crossed Tulare Lake on a steamboat. This
was a regular packet that ran between Hanford and
a small town on the west side of the lake. The dis
tance across was about thirty miles. There were one
or two other steamboats running on the lake at the
time. Sail boats were numerous and altogether Tulare
Lake was of considerable use to the commerce of the
region.
On the occasion that I made my trip across the lake
we were all treated to a si:rprise. When we were about
twelve miles from Hanford, and almost out of sight of
land, the boat ran over the ruina of an old ranch. We
In 1895 the lake was about four or
five miles wide and deep enough for
rrr.all boats. Hunting was still good,
but not like it was in the old days.
At this stage the lake set-med to re
main stationary. The rainfall of the
winters tilled It and it did not dry up
during the summers. Many old-timers
predicted that it would grow no
smaller. They said it had reached its
limit and that there would always be
just about so much water out there.
A few prophets even went so far as to
suggest the building of a summer re-
BOrt, claiming thai it would be well
patronized by people in the interior.
And the plan might have been car
ried out if there had been any rain last
winter. But there wasn't, and Tulare
Lake had to pass out of existence.
Reports from that section now tell
of a strange state of affairs. The land
that was the bottom of the lake last
year is now baking and cracking in
the sun. There are holes big enough
for a man to fall into. All over are
the carcasses of dead fish, filling the
air with foulness. So fast is the evap
oration from the soil under the semi
tropical sun that it is most unpleas

be seen anywhere.

was also the foundation of a house and several metal
utensils scattered about. Nobody on the boat knew
whether the ranch had been on an island that had
sunk from sight or whether it had been on the main
land during some previous dry year. It was a mystery.
When Tulare Lake was a big body of water there
used to be some awful storms sweep over its surface.
Dozens of small boats have been wrecked there. The
Indians who live on the west side have a tradition that
on one occasion a party of about 500 of their tribe at
tempted to cross to the other shore in canoes and
when midway in the lake were struck by a storm. Not
a man was saved. The whole 500 met watery graves
and even the canoes were never seen again.
In my opinion the drying up of Tulare Lake is a
good thing. The land will be good for crops and there
will be less sickness in the vicinity. The sloughs and
marsh land in the old days used to be full of malaria

THE VOLUNTEER AND THE FLEA
BEFORE enlisting for the war I sat
me down and thought
Of all the dreadful things with
which the service might be
fraught,
And weighed with most exacting
care the dangers I would face,
â¢ And thought that I could meet them all
with uncomplaining grace.
I thought that when I'd reach the front
and checked the lengthy lift,
Not one soul-trying hardship from the
schedule would be missed.
But here in these Pacific sands, anear the
Bobbing sea,
I find one I had overlookedâ the Califor
nia flea.
We never kneel to say our "Now-I-lay
me-down" at night
Without the nuisance joining with an ag
gravating bite,
And while our thoughts we try to fix
upon the throne of grace
They're sure to drift in sinful way to
ward the other place.
We scratch and pray and pray and
scratch in alternating way,
Anfl ask forgiveness for the things we're
tempted sore to say,
And often feel like asking the good Lord
above why he
Created such a creature as the California
flea.
When out on drill or dress parade,
hemmed in on every pide
By laughing-eyed, bewitching girls, fair
California's pride.
We fain would please the Western buds
of beauty bo divine
By marching with our heads erect in
straight unbroken line.
But oh! our ranks are broken oft, and
thrown all out of whack
By comrades reaching for a spot located
In the back.
WÂ«r he's a prince of strategy, a wise old
bup is he,
Atid knows where It is safe to feedâ that
California flea.
We do not fear the climate in the dls
. tant Philippines,
We do not fear the clangers of the sea
that intervenes.
We do not fear the Spaniards we expect
to battle there.
Nor any otheY danger on the whole
darnea bill of fare;
But every Colorado boy who wears the
honored blue,
Not only we high privates, but the
shoulder-strappers, too,
Are really afraid to face the fierce ra
pacity
Of this blood-sucking, ravenous old Cali
fornia flea.

AS the mosquito is to New Jersey
so is the flea to California, only
a problem In simple equations,
but don't waste your time in
flg-uring out the answer. There
Is no money in it, but there is a
fortune for tha fellow who can rid
either burg of Its native pest. Any
number have tried their hand at it and j
scientists and other folks sfem to have
made greater headway with the" mos
quito than with the flea. And then
there are any number of other house
hold pests, each of which contributes
its quota of discomfort to man.
Most people think they know all
about fleas. At any rate, all they wish
to know. But really the flea is one of
the most interesting: of insects, and
many great scientists have devoted
years to studying Its habits. The great
French entomologist, Moret, devoted
two solid years to the study cf a single
species. And then he said he had only
begun to find ".ut something.
Scientifically the flea's name is Pulex
:r :â :â¢.. ns. It belongs to the order of
â¢wingless insects a.r.d exists in at least
twenty species and several hundred
varieties. The commonest kind that
exist on this coast are the dog fleas,
cattle fleas, pig fleas, cat fleas and the,
kind that are troublesome to buman
beinrs. Any one of the different kinds
Is capable of being very annoying to a
human being, but those that belong to
animals are not much trouble, because
they can be shaken off, and that is the
end of them; they die very quickly
after being deprived of the animal heat.
Pi<r fleas are the largest and cat fleas
the smallest in this part of the world.
The pig flea often grows to almost the
size of a pram of wheat. Cat fleas are
so small their lep3 can scarcely be seen
with the hurrfan ejrÂ«. They appear
simply as a very tiny black speck.
In some parts of Africa scientists
have found fleas so small that they
could not be seen at all without a glass.
They wero but little larger than vege
table barteria. In this respect they
take rank as the smallest of animal
organism capable of freedom of loco-
The most terrible flea of all is found
in Africa. It is not very large in size,
but it has a habit of depositing its eggÃ
beneath the skin of human beings,
where they hatch, and in a few days
become a troublesomo ulcer that can
only be cured by an application of pow
dered calomel.

LIVELY ADVENTURES OF THE WAR "BUMMERS" IN '65.
THERE was no man in civil life
to whom the term "bummer"
was applied previous to 1861.
The war brought out the man
and t:.e name. Sherman's
"bummers" g: Ined a reputation over
those of any other army, but every
command held its free-lances, and they
were more or less of a factor in the
field.
The "bummer" of the war was neith
er a. guerrilla nor a robber in point of
fact, though the element had its dregs.
He was a man restive of discipline. He
didn't shirk fighting, but he Avanted to
fight when and how he pleased. His
appetite craved something better than
army rations, and he also had a curi
osity to know what was going on be
tween the lines. No matter how strin
gent the orders or how watchful the
provost guard, tha "bummer" found a
way to get out of camp am", go wander
ing about. The advance guard of a
marching army, whether cavalry or in
fantry, always found the free lances
ahead of them. Now and then they
i acted as scouts and brought In valu-
I able information Lut as a rule they had
i little concern except for themselves.
Juet before Hooker set his n-<- in
march for Chanc.llorsville a provost
guard of 100 men was ordered out to
round up a lot of "bummers" who were
raiding the country to the east Four
or five men had bean ov hauled and
made prisoners, when the guard rode
into a Confederate ambush in the
woods and a sharp fight began. Un
known to either side, a crowd of
50 "get-aways" were encamped in the
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 14, 1899.
DEVELOPMENT OF TH|E FLEfI FROM THE EGG TO THE FULL-FLEDGED PEST,
is so troublesome and hard to get rid
of is that it breeds on the ground, in
carpets, old rags and In sand. The only
condition necessary is a moderate de
gree of warmth.
The process through which the Cali
fornia flea passes is the same as all the
other species. Briefly, this is very
much like the silk worm, but more like
the dragon fly, with the difference that
the lntter's evolution takes place in
water.
The exact time of the California flea's
embryonic period has never been ac
curately determined, but as the climate
here is much like the northern shores
same piece of woods about hp a mile
away. As soon as the firing began they
seized their muskets, fell into line, and,
under command of one of their number,
they marched through the woods and
fell upon the enemy's flank and routed
him. But for their timely arrival and
the way they fought not a man of the
provost guard would have escaped.
They had been '-aiding farm houses,
and some of them were ..-earing wo
men's bonnets and skirts as they went
into the fight. Three or four of the fel
lows were killed", but the body of them
escorted the guards back to within a
mile of our lines, and then sent a dozen
fat chickens to General Hooker as a
token of their esteem.
Perhaps the first Confederate bank
raided by Union soldiers was one at
Charleston, Va., as Milroy was mak
ing his way up the Kanawha Valley.
"Bumming" was in its Infancy then,
but a dozen of the fellows found them
selves ahead of the army and resolved
to strike for a big stake. They made a
sudden attack on the town at daylight,
and then dashed in and made for the
bank. They broke in the door with an
ax, obliged the banker to unlock his
safe, and somethi. ~ like half a million
dollars was carried away as they re
treated.
A day later the. bundled up $100,000,
â trapped it on the back of an old lame
mule and hired a farmer to deliver the
"wealth" to General Milroy in person.
Accompanying the money was a r:utp,
which advised the general to bribe the
Confederates to keep ahead of him and
do no fighting. As his military maneu
vers had been checkmated ri"T.t along
and his reputation was under a cloud
It was a hard shot at him. The story
got to "Washington, and was comment
ed on by President Lincoln, and it has

OF ALL OUTCAST HOMELESS FLEAS
Simp!e story of how a humble ilca of ordinary prdisree is bred and is forc:d by cruel circumstances upon a i c <
of the Mediterranean the chances are
the period is nearly the same. Differ
ent scientists have placed this at dif
ferent lengths of time. The longest is
twenty days and the shortest sixteen
days. Most likely both are right, the
difference being due entirely to the dif
ference in temperature.
To strike an average it might be well
to place it at eighteen days.
The first period of the flea's life is in
an egg. The day ofter the egg is laid
,he form of the larva is already visible
on the inside. The second day it
emerges and starts out In life as an
active grub, eyeless and covered with
long hair.
In this condition the creature lives
about eight days, changing a little in
appearance. It then spins itself into a
cocoon, where it remains for at least
nine days. It is during this stage that
the greatest and most rapid change
takes place.
In four days the larva begins to look
like a flea. The long hair gradually
disappears and legs come out on both
sides.
In nine days it is a full fledged flea
and emerges from the cocoon ready and
willing to bite anything on which it
can hop.
Some scientists assert that only the
female is capable of biting, and that
the male is simply annoying by the
"tickling" effect of its legs. Most peo
ple will refuse to credit this and will
argue stoutly that, male or female, the
lively insect couldn't be any worse.
been asserted that the President's lev
ity caused the general to tender his
resignation.
When Stonewall Jackson flanked in
on Pope, the "bummers" were scattered
over a large extent of territory. T.iere
was not a company in any regiment
which had not contributed at leust one
man. They went roaming in squads of
three or four, over highways where no
commander dared send less than half
a regiment, and many were shot or
taken prisoner. Enough were left, how
ever, to terrify the people of every
farm house in every direction. By some
circumstance about 40 of them reached
a certain farm h' use at the same time,
and finding only a woman and two or
three children about, they killed the
only pig left, devoured the last few
chickens, and plundered the house of
whatever took their fancy. As it was a
rainy night they took up their quarters
in the barn.
No sooner were they settled down
than the woman took her children and
set out for help, and after walking
seven miles she encountered a Confed
erate picket post and told of the game
in the trap. Before midnight the barn
was surrounded and every "bummer"
captured, and some of them had not
got back to their regiments when the
war closed.
A month before General Burnside
was relieved of his command the "bum
mer" element was called to his atten
tion so forcibly that he issued more
stringent orders than had ever before
gone out. It was announced that any
soldier who should be found absent
from his command without a pass
would be imprisoned during the re
mainder of the war, with a forfeit of all
pay and allowances. The provost guard
Every housekeeper has a terror of
ants, cockroaches, carpet beetles, moths
and any number of other terrors, to say
nothing of the everyday, everywhere
common housefly. Flypaper is part of
the stock in trade of every grocery
store in the entire country, but reme
dies for the other pests are not so liber
ally provided. Professor Henry Skinner,
an entomologist, has made a careful
study of all sorts of bugs and things
that crawl or fly. He has made our
household pests his particular study.
Recently he lectured at the Academy
of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia,
and during his lecture gave a lot of in
formation of value to housekeepers who
would be rid of household pests. A
great many will agree with Professor
Skinner that dogs and cats are the
greatest breeders of fleas. Not content
with breeding them, all members of the
canine and feline tribes are in the
"common carrier" business when it
comes to a matter of flea distribution.
Ever notice how your pet dog delights
in rubbing up against your legs? He
brushes past on one side, then turns
and gives you a broadside the other
way. From fear that every flea is not
fully awake to the situation he retreats
a few steps, gives himself a shake and
then comes back at you again. Cats
are adepts at the same trick. The
chances are that you will not resent
this familiarity on the part of the pet
until it has fulfilled all its duties as a
"common carrier." Then it is ready
to retire to its favorite rug and take
on another load of pests.
According to Professor Skinner, how
ever, it is a very simple matter to rid
the dogs and cats of fleas. A few
ounces of pyrethrum powder will do
the work. Sprinkle it freely Into the
fur and then wrap the animal with a
thick towel to exclude the air, and in
half an hour every fiea on that dog or
cat is dead. But this only refers to the
present crop, and the operation will
soon have to be repeated, for you may
depend upon it that every one of the
living: fleas on that dog or cat had made
the proper arrangements for a worthy
successor and possibly several of them.
According to Professor Skinner the
was Increased and ordered to do con
stant scouting, but the "bumming"
went on just the same. Then came a
second order, to the effect that any sol
dier absent for two days without leave
should be considered a deserter and
treated accordingly. This brought hack
some of the men to d"'v. but one of the
professionals, at least, came into head
quarters solely in sf.arch of informa
tion. He did not get to see the general
in person, but he had an interview
with one of the staff, and, holding up a
printed copy of the last order tn his
hand, he said:
"Kurnel, the boys kind o- want to
know what this means, and have sent
me in to find out."
"Can't you read?" demanded the col
onel.
"More or less, but we can't jeÃt git on
to the hang of things. Is the war com
ing to an end?"
"It doesn't look like It."
"That's the way we all argue, and
being as Gineral Burnside can't down
Lee in a square fight, why don't he let
us go ahead and eat him out of house
and home till he has to surrender?"
The "anxious inquirer" was sent to
the guardhouse, pending 1 a return to
his company, but he managed to get
away in a day or two. and the next
thing heard of him was a scrawl, in
which he t=aid that four of them had
run a Confederate calf into the woods
and would divide the veal with head
quarters if a regiment was sent to as
sist them to make the capture. Had
Burnside hung on he might have issued
a third order, but even had it announc
ed Instant death as the penalty of
"bumming" he could not have abol
ished it.
A portion of Custer's command was
difficulty to be overcome In ridding a
house of fleas or other pests is that in
sects possess marvelous fecundity and
while there are only hundreds living
there are thousands in various stages
of development. Therefore, unless the
remedies are followed up promptly, it is
only a quesfton of days and in some
cases hours when we will have a new
crop that can bite quite as ferociously
as did the previous ones. As fleas and
other insects delight to revel and breed
in dirt, it follows that the great preven
tive is absolute cleanliness. He recom
mends that carpets should be taken up
at least twice a year, while every room
should be swept and thoroughly dusted
several times a week. Care must be
taken that dust does not collect in
corners and every crack in the floor
must be carefully closed. He recom
mends that in sweeping the house
keener should place some kerosene in
the little tin tray of the carpet-sweeper
and then as she wheels over the carpet
the fleas are carried in and killed by
Professor Skinner claims that the flea
undergoes its transformation in various
kinds of dust, and that an apparently
harmless collection of dust in a corner
may prove tr be a perfect flea incuba
tor Mats rugs o" straw on which the
favorite poodle or pet cat may pass its
sleeping hours are also fertile fields
when it comes to flea raising, and as
these places are always loaded with
fleas in various stages of transforma
tion it is well that they should be fre
quently attended to. It will do little
good to rid the pets of their fleas if they
are allowed to go right back to their
bed and take on another load.
It does not require the instructions of
the professor to know that fleas delight
in flesh and have an inborn faculty of
picking out the most tender morsels.
Many housekeepers have thought to
trap the wily flea by placing a piece of
raw meat on a piece of fly paper and
laying it on the floor, the idea being
that the flea will be attracted to the
meat, and in his frantic efforts to reach
It light on the fly paper and stick there.
Professor Skinner says that this is a
delusion, not for the fly but to the
housekeeper, for dead flesh offers no
inducement to the enlcurean flea, and
the only ones that are so caught are
those that light there by accident.
According to Professor Skinner, the
proper way to use fly paper in catching
fleas, that is, if you feel that you must
use it, is to tie it about your legs the
sticky side outward, it is pre
sumed, although the learned pro
fessor Is silent on this point, and
when thus armed walk up and down
the floor. It is a known fact that fleas
can sight an approaching person at
some distance, when they Immediately
square themselves for an attack and al
wayÃ manage to light plumb on the an
kle of the Intruder. The professor
would have you take advantage of this
peculiarity of the flea and by the use
of the fly paper turn it to his own de
struction. There is one point, however,
that the professor overlooks, and
that is to give warning aa to
the manner of walking. To do
the sticky-fly-paper-flea-act properly,
one should have first become a snow-
Bhoe expert in order to learn the proper
walk and control of the feet, for if you
are careless in your movements and
are at all inclined to "interfere" the
chances are that you will not have gone
man steps before an entanglement
may follow that will result in the con
fttMon and abashment of the Intruder.
Professor Skinner quotes an instance
In which the janitor of a flea-ridden
college quickly banished the pests by
the use of fly paper. The Janitor
donned long-legged rubber boots, which
he had previously covered with fly pa
per. Thus armed he made his rounds
through the college halls and rooms
and acting the part of the man with
the seven league boots, with the excep
tion of in this instance the fleas in
their endeavor to get away with the
big boots brought about their own de-
Another pest which man has to con
tend with, but fortunately not to any
extent in California, except in certain
localities, is the mosquito. In this
State the mosquito is not a universal
pest, yet there are many locations that
can claim "the Jersey canaries" an
among their products. It is said that
they flourish best in warm moist
climates, but It is hard to figure out
the degree of heat they delight in or
the degree of cold that they can with
stand, for mosquitoes are to be found
in every tropical clime, and on the
other hand the gold-seekers from
Alaska tell wonderful stories of the size
and ferocity of the mosquitoes that live
in that region of snow and Ice.
All mosquitoes live and thrive in
stagnant water and usually undergo
their transformation in rain barrels,
sewage water, cesspools and drains.
According to Professor Skinner, who
has studied their habits, the female
mosquito's egg mass contains over five
hundred eggs. These she deposits on
the surface of tb,e water and the young
hatch out in about sixteen hours. The
larvae breathe through little tubes
which they stick up out of the water,
and the only way to rid a locality of
mosquitoes is by an attack on the
breeding places. This is a very simple
method as one only has to pour a little
kerosene on the surface of the water
where one supects mosquitoes might be
breeding. The film that spreads over
the water from the kerosene not only
kills the eggs which the female may
have deposited, but kills all larvae In
process of transformation. One ounce

came upon a queer state of affairs at a
farm house. Two hours previously a
gang of seven "bummers" had come
along and started in to loot the house.
The farmer was a Confederate soldier,
who was home on furlough to be nursed
for a wound in the thigh. He was not
able to leave his bed. but his wife hand
ed him his musket, and he shot one of
the men dead and drove the rest out.
They did not go away, however, being
determined to kill him and burn the
house In revenge. He had his bed
drawn to the door, and being propped
up. he kept them away from the rear
of the house, while his wife, who was
armed with an old revolver, fired often
enough to prevent any approach to th%
front. There was a spring house of
solid build a few rods from the back
door, and the "bummers" entered it to
regale themselves before closing in on
the house. The door opened inward,
and while they were playing havoc
with the milk pans the woman ap
proached and pulled the door to and
thrust a stick through the handle. The
structure was too solid Jo be beaten

WAR PHOTOGRAPHY
on
A BIG SCALE.
PHOTOGRAPHY is playing: a w
markably large part in the war.
Uncle Sam Is conducting thÂ»
biggest photographic establish
ment on earth and when the war
Is over there will be thousands upon
thousands of negatives carefully filed
away in the National Library at Wash
ington providing a pictorial record of
the war for future generations. Thou
sands of photographs are already piled
up at Washington and the stream will
pour in until the end.
This is one of the interesting func
tions of the Signal Corps and Chief
Signal Officer Greely has organized the
photographic service on a greater scale
and with more completeness than was
ever done by any nation in time of war
before.
The arrangements to photograpn.
every conceivable feature of the Philip
pine campaign are typical of what is
being done even more extensively in
Cuba and wherever land or naval oper
ations are going on. Uncle Sam's chief
photographer himself is sailing west
ward on the Newport with three other
photographers, all members of the sig
nal company of flfty-five which has
gone forward. This is Sergeant H. W.
Chadwick, who has been with the Sig
nal Corps for several years. He is an
expert and for a long time has been in
charge of the photographic work of the
Signal Corps. Before the beginning of
the war he was stationed <-t the Na
tional L.brary at Washington in imme
diate charge of that great and price
less collection of photographs of the
civil war taken by Brady and sold to
the Government for a fortune. In the
game collection are photographs illus
trating the recent Graeco-Turkish war
for which 1 ncle Sam paid the modest
sum of $27,000. There are thousands of
other pictures and negatives i^ed with
every possible precaution for their pre
servation. Anybody who wanted copies
of any of these pictures could get them
after having a little trouble with Ser
geant Chadwick.
On the breaking- out of hostilities
Chadwick was rushed to the front at
Tampa, and then he had influence
enough to get into the Philippine ser

outfit and then started in buying. He
spent orer $1000 in a few days in sup
plementing his outfit of the corps. Old
photographic supply dealers say that
so fine and complete a photographic
field outfit was never seen before.
Chadwick also took along everything
needed for working by the old and al
most forgotten wet plate processes. If
climate or accident spoils his films and
plates he can start in and make his
own plates, as they did a generation
ago. His field dark room Is an in

Sergeant Chadwick began taking anil
collecting photographs as soon as he
arrived here. He photographed Camp
Merritt in its every feature and se
cured copies of many views by pro

views to Washington and some ama

know that their pictures are already
part of the official record of the war.

be the duty of these photographers of

of risk and take a constant series of
snap shots of the troops and the enemy
showing every position and movement

great number of photographs of this
character illustrating both land and

In addition the signal corps will

It hard.
The first game ever opened in the
town was operated by Johnny Newman
in a little stone house on A street in
1861. There are some who contend that
"Put" Robson dealt faro in 1860, and
they dub him the '"Father of Faro" on
the Comstock. Even as early as 1859 a
Mexican named Jesus Lopez, who died
a few years since in Carson City, dealt
a small game. But the honor, if such
it may be called, of dealing the first
faro game in the town belongs to John
ny Newman, in whose little cabin for
tunes were won and lost.
Shortly after Newman started his
layout Jim Barclay of Marysvllle open
ed a big game on B street, near Sutton
avenue, and in 1863 "Put" Robson, in
partnership with Joe Stewart, had a
game at 43 South C street, which was
fast becoming famous for its faro re
sorts.
This layout, another. at "No. 45. ' run
by Maugi and Slssa, and a third .at
"No. 47," earned a quarter of a million
dollars apiece for the lucky owners in
side of six months during the winter
of 1563-64.
The game at "No. 43." later run by
Sttwart- and: A brier Gentry, wÂ«s most
popular with the moneyed men of the
time. The detailed history of the place
would make a most interesting volume.
Some big winnings are recorded, al
though the bank's side of the account
is far the heavier by long odds.
"Long Brown," well remembered on
the lode, once won $7000 playing what is
was at a period that might be desig
nated a-s the "dawn of commerce." It
was when the great nations of the
world were reaching out and looking
ther conquest than that of the
sword.
li Kamon no Kami had been outside
of his own country and did not look
upon all the other people of the world
as devils. He advocated intercourse
with them and an exchange of cour
at least. In order to pain ad
herents for his cause he traveled all
ov< i Japan, making the journeys in the
nori mono now on exhibition at the
Art Association rooms.
As history .shows Ii Kamon no Kami
met with poor success in his under
taking. In fact he v.iis often driven out
of villages for advocating such an out
rageous doctrine as intercourse with
foreigners.
The strongest opponent of progress
vas Prince Mito, a thoroughly old
fashioned Japanese, who had the great
est faith in the traditions of the past
and who believed the idea of improve
ment to be a curse. The slight success
that Ii Kamon no Kami did gairi so
incensed him that he employed a squad
of ruflians to follow him wherever he
went and inflame the people against
him.
In this plan the wily Prince was suc
cessful. On a certain day Ii Kamon no
Kami made a speech before the nobles
in Tokio and a number were inclined
to listen to him, all of which only made
Prince Mito more furious than ever.
What orders he issued to his hired
ruffians will never be known, but when
II Kamon do Kami was on his way
home after making his speech a crowd
set upon him. He was riding in his
norl mono, but his carriers were over
powered and he was dragged out into
the street where the mob attacked him.
Swords, spears, knives and even clubs
were used on the unfortunate man so
that in a few minutes he was simply
hacked to death.
In this awful assassination the norl
mono, strange to gay, did not suffer.
The Japanese and Chinese, as Is well
known, have a certain respect for prop
erty even when they have none for the
owner. But In this Instance the prop
erty of Ii Kamon i > Kami received
several deep scars. The carrying pole
of the norl mono was hacked in several
places and a few of the small slats
were broken. Even a good coat of
lacquer has been unable to conceal these
Injuries and they can be plainly seen
to this day on the old norl mono as It

"You haven't been married very long,

TRICKS OF BOUNTY JUMPERS IN THE CIVIL WAR.
At the outbreak of the civil war the
young men of the North exhibited their
patriotism by enlisting for the defense
of the Un.on a3 eagerly as they are
coming forward to fight against Spain.
No bounties were paid at first, and
nearly 1,000,000 men volunteered with
no more pecuniary inducement than the
regular army pay.
After a time, however, volunteering
languished, and to stimulate enlist
ments bounties were offered by the na
tion, the States and the cities and
towns. This not bringing forth recruits

and sentiment was by no means dead
in those rough times, and one historical
winning turned on the player's remem
brance of his "folks at home." This
lucky player, a famous bonanza king
now," had rceived an English shilling in
change at une of the stores and noticed
that it bore the date of his family's ar
rival in America. So when he fumbled
the strange coin in his pocket he
thought of sister and brother and of
soft pink baby hands and wavy gray
hair under a lace cap, and of worlds of
love and kindness stored up for him at
home.
Finally the shilling became the last
coin left in the shrinking pocket, and
the man, reduced to his last quarter,
decided to risk the shilling at faro.
Blessed hope! He bet on the tray-ten
and won $1800 before he rose from the
table. That was the beginning of a big
fortune. To-day it helps maintain one
.if the finest homes in San Francisco.
Eli Skaggs holds the record for the
biggest gains and losses at one sitting,
having once won $.SOO on two turns of
the cards. The sitting netted him $2000.
Another evening he quietly lost $5600.
But for losses that give a man a new
sensation perhaps one that occurred in
'79 should be recorded in which Johnny
Skae, the mine boss, lost $10,000 in ten
turns to Joe Stewart.
George F. Jones, too, had a reputa
tion as a loser, dropping in all $95,000
at faro. The aforesaid dollars, by the
way, belonged not to Jones, but to one
of the most economical, thrifty money
getters that ever lived, a millionaire
who cannot bear to see a stray nail
going to waste on the street.
Faro had not as many tragedies to
its account on the Comstock as poker
games, for the reason that the faro
player always loses to the "bank,"
which, in spite of the firm name and
the flesh-and-blood dealer has no in
dividuality and never arouses the ani
mosity which the gambler sometimes
feeis for his opponent at poker. It is
simply fate when one loses at faro and
there is no use kicking.
At the same time the faro banks of
the Comstock have turned the current
of many a life and one instance just
it hand is truly pathetic. There came
to the Comstock one day a fine old
g.-ntleman 'Tom the Snuth. sun." one
of the blue blonds of that aristocratic
locality and its manners and traditions
innate* with him. Accompanying him
was his beautiful daughter and her
husband, a rank Northerner and their
four charming children. They pros
pered on the Comstock and lived in the
hospitable fashion of Southern people,
but faro held out her seductive hand
and both the men became her victims.
A considerable bank account went first,
then the home was mortgaged, and one
day the husband died very suddenly.
in sufficient numbers, the draft was re
sorted to. Drafted men were paid
smaller bounties, or none at all, and
this fact sent into the service as vol
unteers many who were liable to con
scription.
Men who were drafted often, when
able. procured substitutes, paying
at first ?100, then $200, then $300, and
finally, as available substitutes grew
scarce much larger amounts, touching
in some instances $1600. Many cities

The procuring of men to serve as
substitutes and to make up deficient
quotas grew into a business of itself,
and a very profitable one at that.
"Substitute brokers" quickly appeared
in great numbers all over the North,
and they made enormous profits by
agreeing to fill quotas at so much per
recruit.
Out of this business naturally grew
many abuses. For example, a firm of

LONDON. July 29.â After some
centuries of discussion and
planning the Nile is at last to
be dammed. The plans have
been completed for some time
and as soon as the season's
floods have subsided the contractors ,
will have several hundred men busy on
the stone work at Assouan.
The man who is to have the direc- i
tion of the work, which will rank as
the greatest irrigation scheme ever at
tempted and one of the engineering
feats of the age, is Sir Benjamin
Baker, whose name is already associ
ated with many great enterprises. Mr.
Benjamin is himself ready to start for
Assouan, where he will assume per- i
sonal direction of the undertaking. In
discussing the matter a few days ago
he hazarded the prediction that by the
beginning of the twentieth century the
first steamer would pass through the
locks into the reservoir, on its way to
the upper Nile. Whatever difficulties
may be encountered in the work it
probably will not take so long as it has
for thVlChedive and bis French advis
ers~to make up their minds to sanc
tion it.
The effect of the dam as at present
conceived will be to submerge the
nearer islands only, but as originally
planned it would at flood time, or "high

INFLUENCES OF THE WAR ON POLITICS
Matters have not yet developed sufficiently to glva
us solid ground upon which to base any specific con
clusions.
The final result will be determined by events which
will take place in the near future. I do not think
that any new party will come into being because of
the war; the old parties are strong enough and in
telligent enough to grapple with and settle all the
difficult questions which will come up for considera
tion.
Meanwhile President McKinley has met the emer
gency most ably and satisfactorily. He has done the
best that could be done under extremely trying cir
cumstances. He has faced the difficult situation
bravely and nobly, and has gained the universal re
spect of his countrymen whatever may be their po
litical beliefs and affiliations. Our nation has at
tained an eminence of which we are all loyally proud,
and it has bÂ°en proven that in this war against bar

thÂ« field, namely: Free silver, extreme State rights,
etc., and it can be said with truth that State lines,
even, seem to have bren almost obliterated by the
tremendous wave of patriotic enthusiasm which has
swept over our nation.
This wave bore down before it the opposition to
the annexation of Hawaii which was felt in time of
peace and has given the public mind an impetus in
favor of the completion of the Nicaragua canal and it
is still sweeping onward.
Already a desire has been created to see our ter
ritorial limits expand, to the extent at least of re
taining what has been so bravely won by our daring
soldiers and sailors. Already there has sprung, from
the necessity of battling in a common cause, a unifi
cation of feeling such as has not been ours forÂ«many
years. This is not only true as regards our younger
men, but the middle-aged and old have remembered
their brotherhood and clasped hands again under their
country's Hag. Many also have been drawn back to
old affiliations who, under stress of hard times and in
the dullness and inactivity of peace, had wandered
away In other directions.
The able statesmanship of President McKinley,
which has been shown in his masterly handling of
vexed questions and his vigorous and successful pros
ecution of the war, has inspired confidence in his ad
ministration and has excited great admiration and
enthusiasm even among those who were formerly op
posed to him from a political standpoint. This change
of feeling will have its influence in the political cam
paigns of the future.

think, will be produced by a general disposition to
sustain President McKinley in anything he may do,
not only in settling the problems \. hich are certain
to grow out of the war, but in generally restoring
national affairs to a normal condition.
I think too much praise cannot be accorded to the
President fur the manner in which he has managed
this difficulty. His policy has been strong, intelligent,
vigorous, prompt and eminently statesmanlike. He
has shown himself to be a safe counselor and a sa
gacious guide. If the American people do not ap
preciate him and support the political party which
has placed him in power it will be strange indeed.
So I think the Republican party throughout the
country, in a national sense, will be greatly strength
ened by the events of the war. What effect this ten
dency will have upon local politics it is difficult to
determine. Probably, all things being equal, the Re
publicans will feel the effect of the public: approval
of the conduct of the war by President McKinley and
a Republican Congress.
I should say that if the Republicans nominate
strong candidates for Congress everywhere, that is,
men in whom the people have confidence, and declare
strongly in favor of the new policy which has been
formulated by the President and his Cabinet and
which they are bound tp carry out, they will easily
carry all the doubtful States of the Union and per

I do believe that the Declaration of Independence
and the constitution are the charter of this Govern
ment and the political gospel of humanity.
I do not believe that our institutions, as interpreted
and applied since 1776, either legally or in policy, can
maintain their present rel -.tions to our own citizens
and to the human race if we acquire and hold alien
dependencies and especially if we undertake to govern
Asiatic populations.
I do believe that imperial conquest and colonization
are the especial work of the British Government, ana
that our mission is the permanent establishment of a
republic, held together for all legitimate national pur
poses, but composed of autonomous parts, each con
trolled by free citizens, of the best blood of the best
races, of the highest intelligence and of systematic
education.
I do not believe that these connected but distinct
functions in the development of civilized man can be
blended without injury to both and destruction to the
United States, which might survive as an empire,
but would cease to be a republic.
I do believe that the adjustment of Internal con
ditions on this continent, the development of citizen
ship to correspondence with our form of government
and, the application of American principles to our
commercial, financial, intellectual and humanitarian
relations with the remainder of the world will de
mand all our energy during the twentieth century.
I do not believe that manifest destiny means the
$230,990,000; that the increase to annual
produce will be $83,060,000, and to an
nual rent $26,950,000. These estimates

that as far as the State of California is concerned
Democratic interests will suffer little if at all through
present conditions and the future conditions which
are to grow out of them.
I have never understood the reason which has
guided the suffrage of the people either of the State
or the nation as regards the sentiment against the
Democratic party. My own ideas are that the dem
ocracy of the nation have been those who have always
upon all occasions rushed to the support of the flag
of the nation.
In the present trouble between Spain and the United
States we have se-en that the men from the Southern
part of the country where the Democratic party is so
noticeably in the majority have been among the first
to come to the front and are second to none in their
ardent desire and determination to maintain the honor
of our republic at the expense of life itself.
What the effect of this war may be in the State of
California I would not for one moment attempt to
prophesy. There is nevertheless a very positive view
on my part that the Democracy of the State may win

WONDERFUL TREE OF
TEN THOUSAND IMAGES
OF all the wonderful sights re
ported by the Jesuit mission
aries, Hue and Gobet, during
their explorations of Thibet, by
far the strangest is what they
have to say of the Tree of Ten
Thousand Images. They had heard
suit in absolute failure and
would serve no purpose what
ever. Tile subject is one
which will command the
a decidedly minor power in
our national politics. I have,
however, the idea that this
present war will by no means
about this wonderful tree long before
they reached the locality of Its growth,
and as they approached the spot their
curiosity regarding it increased a thou
sand fold.
Here is their narrative of the result
of their examination of the tree:
"It will here be naturally expected
that we say something about this tree
itself. Does it exist? Have we seen
it? Has it any peculiar attributes?
What about its marvelous leaves?
"Yes, this tree does exist. At the
foot of the mountain on which the
Lamasery stands, and not far from the
principal Buddhist temple, is a great
square inclosure, formed by brick
walls. Upon entering this we were
able to examine at leisure the marvel
ous tree, some of the branches of which
had already manifested themselves
above the wall.
"Our eyes were first directed with
earnest curiosity to the leaves, and we
were fWled with an absolute conster
nation of astonishment at finding that^
in point of fact, there were upon each
of the leaves well formed Thibetan

of every detail, we could not discover
the least deception. The characters

Itself equally with its veins and
nerves- the position was not the same
in all; in one leaf they would be at the
top of the leaf; in another, in the mid
dle- in a third, at the base, or at the
side- the younger leaves represented
the characters only in a partial state of
formation. , ..
"The bark of tho tree and Its
branches, which resemble that of the
plane tree, are also covered with these
characters. When you remove a piece
of the old bark the young bark under
it exhibits the indistinct outlines of
characters in a germinating state, and,
what is very singular, these new char

! from those which they replace. We ex-

of trickery, but we could discern noth

The missionaries. Hue and Gobet,
might have remained in Thibet as long
as they wished had it not been for the
interference of the Chinese Embassador
there. For some reason this individual
took a dislike to them and ultimuuly
caused them to depart. The Lamas

This idea seems to me erroneous in the extreme,
since I firmly believe that ..he old parties will be fully
competent to handle the questions which will una

One thing at least in this time of uncertainty is
certain, and that is that this war has given to the
North and South a union of feeling such as years of
peaceful existence side by side could never have
brought into being. Hereafter sectional distinctions
and dissensions will be overlooked in the broader view
which all our citizens, irrespective of party and local
ity, will take of national affairs.
When the United States of America called upon
her sons to support her convictions, uphold her flag,
and fight her battles, those sons came hurrying from
East and West and North ana South, and joined hands
and hearts in the name of their common and well
beloved country-
This Union, cemented in the presence of a foreign
foe, will be enduring and henceforward the thought
of North and South will be eliminated from the field
of politics. Each party will formulate plans which it
feels convinced will, if carried out, work for the best
good of the country as a whole; local prejudices and
jealousies will be entirely eliminated, and the best
good of the greatest number will be the real point at
issue in our differences of opinion.

and its immediate value but little ap
preciated at the time. It is worthy of
notice that the number of the slain in
this single conflict was far in excess of
the total of those killed in battle dur
ing the entire Civil War of 1861-65,
though it has been computed that at
least five million men carried arms in
the course of the struggle between the

thoughts of the great victory in which
the illustrious Nelson played such a
memorable part. At Trafalgar, in ISOS,
a British fleet of 33 ships of the line
and 4 frigates (the armored cruisers of
modern fleets), engaged a combined
French and Spanish battle array of
40 ships and 5 frigates, and of the con
flict which ensued M. Thiers has said
that '"such a scene of horror at sea had
never been witnessed in the memory of
man."
A single broadside from the Tem
eraire, a British ship, swept 200 men
from the decks of the Redoubtable and
hurled them into eternity. This par
ticular French ship numbered 572 dead
in a crew of 680 officers and men, only
eight officers escaping of the forty on
board. At the close of the terrible
struggle 17 French and Spanish ships
had been captured and one blown up,
and between killed, wounded, drowned
and prisoners the losses of the allies
amounted to nearly 7000 men; on the
English ships 1687 Jack Tars had sur
rendered their lives. How ludicrous
seems the vaunted destructiveness of
the modern engines of war, when four
teen Spanish ships, in their own harbor
and backed up by strong shore bat
teries, could not make the slightest im
pression on the gallant Dewey's six
large vessels nor even l.ill a single
man! And the recently published re
sults show that the awful destruction
that was done among the boats of the
Dons was accompanied by the death
of but 78 of the sailors and marines
that manned them.
HORSELESS CARRIAGES
ARE CLEARING THE WAY
THE horseless carriage is at last
declared to be a success. :
It Is true that this vehicle is
hardly likely to ever come Into
general use in San Francisco on
account of the hills,. but in most of the
big cities of the world the horse is
destined to - soon become a curiosity,
perhaps only to 'be seen in menageries
and museums. The clatter of hoofs
over cobbles and asphalt \is about ' to
give place to the whiz of the electric
motor, the puff of the: gasoline engine
and the soft rattle of the coal oil loco
motive. And the general verdict of
thinking men is that it is well.
For the. last ten years horseless , car

upon them as curiosities and the pa

of horses displaced has hardly been

ANCIENT TEMPLES THAT UNCLE SAM
HAS ANNEXED WITH HAWAII.
So Highly Are the Ruins Esteemed by the Natives That Money Was
Set Aside for Their Preservation and Now the Islanders
Want to Know What Is to Become of Them,
UNCLE SAM came Into posses
sion of some wonderful ancient
heathen temples when he an
nexed Hawaii, and curious tour
ists and scientists are begin
ning to ask what he is going to do with
them. Native Hawaiians regard them
as something much more than histori
cal landmarks, something to link the
past with the present, and for years
the native kingdom has appropriated
money for their careful preservation.
Father Damien, the leper priest of
Molokai, made a careful study of sev
eral of these interesting temples and
gathered a great deal of material con
cerning their history.
The following is one of the legends
obtained and written by him con
cerning the Heiau in the Mapulahu
Gulch on that island. He obtained it
from one of the oldest natives on the
island:
A company of spirits who
brought over the stones of
this Heiau from Wailau, a
gulch on the other side of the
island. Each spirit got only
one stone to build this im
mense Heiau. The name of
the company of spirits was
"Kamenehuni."
Whatever the legend may be there is
ample evidence to prove where the
stones came from which went to form
this building. It is said that they were
passed over the mountain from the
other side of the island by natives
standing in a row about six feet apart
and handing them from one to the
other.
As the structure is 400 feet long and
200 feet broad with an average height
of 10 feet some idea may be formed of
the enormous population that must
have existed upon Molokal at that pel
riod. It took nearly 30,000 cubic yards
of material to build this temple.
At present the inhabitants of the
Hawaiian Islands are Christians, but
they still have a certain reverence for
held their own with them. There were
only a few in use, but they competed
successfully with the cabs and received
a fair amount of patronage. It is as
serted that this would have been more
if the horseless carriages were more
plentiful. As it was they attracted so
much curious attention many people
disliked them. Were they in general
use this objection would be removed.
And they are going to be in general
use, In Paris at least, within the next
few months, or as fast as the machines
can be built, for the big cab company
over there has decided to adopt them
entirely.
The few that have been in operation
In Paris during the last three years
demonstrated to the cabmen that they
could be made more profitable than
horses If certain improvements were
made. But how to pet the improve
ments was another matter that was at
last overcome by offering large prizes
to builders of the vehicle In order to
stimulate them to greater efforts.
This plan has borne good fruit, for
last year a number of big Improve
ments showed up. Again the cabmen
offered prizes and the "exhibition" has
Just closed, the result being a number
of carriages that answered all require
ments and stood all tests. The Judges
pronounced at least a dozen to be "per
fect," but have not yet decided as to
these old temples and look upon them
as the great connecting link between
the past and the present. The first
mention in civilized records of these
buildings appears to have been about
1819. Travelers and missionaries were
beginning to enter the country and the
most striking objects were naturally
the immense piles of stone, totally dif
ferent from any other buildings in the
world.
At this time Kamehameha I had suc
ceeded in conquering and subduing the
natives of the adjoining islands and
their chiefs had been compelled to ac
knowledge his supreme authority as
king, and these people, for the first time
in their history, were to be united un
der one government.
It took nearly forty years to accom
plish this unity, but Kamehameha was
a man of iron and well deserves the
name he bears in Hawaiian history,
"the conqueror.'
During these years of conquest and
bloodshed a great change was coming
over these most interesting people, and
the last acts of heathenism, accom
panied by horrible human sacrifices
and other abominable customs, were
passing away.
Some doubt formerly existed as to
whether cannibalism ever prevailed in
the Hawaiian group or -was practiced at
any time. The natives themselves al
ways manifested a degree of shame,
ho-rror and confusion when spoken to
upon the subject, and this led the
great navigator. Captain Cook, and his
officers, without any direct evidence, to
believe in its existence, but later voy-
ANCIENT TEMPLE OF ILIILIOPOI IN T^E MÂ£PULAh|U VALLEY
ISLAND Of MOLO^AI.
This Is one of the oldest temples on the island; just how many centuries
agro it was built archaeologists have not yet determined. Like the other tem
ples, the legend declares that this one was built by each native carrying a
stone across the Island. Father Damlen made a careful study of this temple
and left considerable memoranda regarding it.
LAST HEATHEN TEMPLE BUILT IN HAWAII.
It was erected shortly before the advent of Christianity on the island and
marks the place where the last human sacrifice was offered up to the gods.
The cross indicates the position of the sacrificial stone where Â£he victims
were killed. This was in 1791, after Kamehameha I had subjugated the last

agers disputed this conclusion. Their
own historians, however, and the gen
eral acknowledgment of the people
have fairly established the custom be
yond a doubt, though it appears to haye
somewhat abated previous to Cook's
visit, and had gradually decreased un
til scarcely a vestige of any of the hor
rible custom remained. There can be
no doubt this humanizing improvement,
so different from their other habits,
was the result of the example and in
struction received from the earliest
white visitors, as well as a self-convic
tion of its own abomination. A strong
public sentiment of disgust in regard to
it prevailed at that time, and it was
highly creditable to them as a nation
and distinguished them from their more
savage contemporaries of the other
groups of the Pacific.
It was in this state of transition that
the early settlers found these islanders,
which one is the very best But the
cab company has decided to adoj t
them, feeling sure of success on account
of the perfection of so many.
The cabmen who have encouraged
this work have formed themselves into
an organization known as the auto
mobile club.
At the exhibition that has just closed
twenty-six vehicles were put through
the tests despite the severity of the
programme, which. made obligatory a
daily run of thirty-six miles, at a mini
mum, within a period of sixteen hours.
The vehicles admitted to the compe
tition figured in the following six cate
gories:* " _ ; . ; ,â '

years to tear down the last barriers of
heathenism.
Of those times there still remain in
perfect preservation, as relics of the
horrible past, the stc-ne temples or
"Heiaus," which bring to mind the aw
ful state of things existing a century
ago.
Of the most interesting of these hea
thenish buildings, one is on the island
of Molokal. It was built some centuries
ago and is considered one of the oldest
temples in the Hawaiian group. The
other one is on the west or Kona coast
of Hawaii, is the last one ever built,
being erected a little over a hundred
years ago.
In 1791 Kamehameha I, during hia
wars of subjugation, to show his vener
ation of the god?. 4 and to secure a con
tinuance of their iavor and strengthen
his kingdom, engaged in building a
very large temple at Kawaihae for the
worship of Kaili, the god of war. and
for offering human and other sacrifices.
It was built on a hill and called Puuha
koToa. While, he was engaged in erect
ing this temple, which wa# consecrated
â with human blood, some^of his warriors
were conquering the southern part of
Hawaii, where his own relative, Keona,
was then King. r Keona soon after
ward became disheartened and sur
rendered himself and his warriors in the
hope of receiving life and mercy. He,
however, with many of his lesser chiefs
and men, were slain and their bodiea
sacrificed on the altar of the new ter
n was the last human sacrifice
ever made on the Hawaiian Islands.
The victims were executed in the pres
ence of Kamehameha himself, who
stood at the door of the house within a
stone inclosure to witness this slaugh
ter.
There are a few other Heiaus still in
excellent preservation, one of which is
near Kohala, on Hawaii, and another
at Kealekakoa Bay, which is said to
have been used by Captain Cook to re
pair his sails, and by whom the sandal
wood altar had been removed. It was
from this temple that Kalaniopuu, then
King, took the three-headed god, "L.o
no," off to Captain Cook' 3 vessel, the
Discovery. Whether these monuments
of the past ages will be kept in preserve
by Uncle Sam, now that we have pos
session of the islands, remains to be
proved.

THEN it isn't a question of property or next of kin?"
said the Consul.
"Lord! no!" said the lady, vivaciously. "Why,
goodness? me! I reckon old Desborough could at any
time before he died have bought up and bought out
the whole lot of his relatives on this side of the big- pond
so matter what they were worth. No â it's only a matter
Â»{ curiosity and just soeiableness."
The American Consul at St. Kentigorn felt much re
lieved. He had feared it was only the old story of delusive
quests for imaginary estates and impossible Inheritances
rnich he had confronted so often in nervous, wan-eyed en-
thuslasts and obstreperous claimants from his own land.
Certainly there was no suggestion of this In the richly
dressed and bediamoned matron before him, nor in her
pretty daughter, charming in a Paris frock, alive with the
consciousness of beauty and admiration, and yet a little
ennuye from gratified indulgence. He knew the mother to
be the wealthy widow of a New York millionaire, that she
â was traveling for plesaure in Europe, and a chance meet-
Ing with her at dinner a few nights before had led to this
half capricious, half confidential appointment at the con
sulate.
"No," continued Mrs. Desborough, "Mr. Desborough
came to America when a small boy with an uncle who
died some years ago. Mr. Desborough never seemed to
hanker much after his English relatives as long as I knew
him, but now that I ana Sadie are over here why we
guessed we might look 'em up and sort of sample 'em.
Desborough's rather a good name," added the lady, with a
complacency that, / however, had a suggestion of- query
in It.
"Yes," said the Consul; "from the French, I fancy."
"Mr. Desborough was Englishâ very English," " cor
rected the lady.
"I mean it may be an old Norman name." said the
Consul.
"Norman's good enough for me," said the daughter,
reflecting. "We'll just settle it as Norman. I never
thought about that Des."
"Only you may find It called 'Debborough' here, and
spelt so," said the Consul, smiling.
Miss Desborough lifted her pretty shoulders and made
a charming grimace. "Then we won't acknowledge 'em.
Xso Debborough for me!"
"You might put an advertisement In the papers, like
the 'next of kin' notice, Intimating. In the regular way,
that they would 'hear of something to their advantage' â
as they certainly continued the Consul, with a
bow. "It would be such a refreshing change to the kind of
thing I'm accustomed to, don't you know!â this idea of one
of my countrywomen cpming over just to benefit English
relatives! By Jove! I wouldn't mind undertaking the
whole thing for youâ it's such a novelty." He was quite
carried away with the idea.
But the two ladies were far from participating in this
Joyous outlook. "No," said Mrs. Desborough, promptly,
"that wouldn't do. You see," she went on with superb
frankness, "that would be just giving ourselves away, and
saying who we were before we found out what they were
like. Mr. Desborough was all right in h:s way, but we
don't know anything about his folks! We ain't here on a
mission to improve the Desboroughs, nor to gather in any
'lost tribes.' >r . .
It was evident that in spite of the humor of the situa
tion and the levity of the ladies there was a characteris
tic national practicalness about them, and the Consul,
with a sigh, at last gave the address of one or two respon
sible experts In genealogical inquiry, as he nad aften done
before. He felt it was impossible to offer any advice to
ladles as thoroughly capable of managing their own af
fairs as his fair countrywomen, yet he was not without
some curiosity to know the result of their practical senti
mental quest. That he should ever hear of them again he
doubted. He knew that after the first loneliness had worn
off in their gregarious gathering at a London hotel they
were not likely to consort with their own country people,
who. Indeed, were apt to fight shy of each other, or even
.ndulge in invidious criticism of one another when admit
ted to that society in which they were all equally strang
ers. So he took leave of them on their way back to Lon
don with the belief that their acquaintance terminated
with that brief incident. But he was mistaken. â 
In the year following he was spending his autumn vaca
tion at a country house. It was a historic house, and had
always struck him as beingâ even in that county of his- i
toric seatsâ a singular example of the vicissitudes of En
glish manorial estates and the mutations or its lords. ' His
host In his prime had been recalled from foreign service
to unexpectedly succeed to an uncle's title and estate.
That estate, however, had come into the possession of the
uncle only through his marriage with the daughter of an
older family whose portraits still looked down from the
walls upon the youngest and alien branch. There were
likenesses, effigies, memorials, and reminiscences of still
older families who had occupied it through forfeiture by
war or the favoritism of kings, and in its stately cloisters
and ruined chapel was still felt the dead hand of Its evict

PHOTOGRAPHING without light, while a verbal con
tradiction, is so far the only term found that lends
itself to describing the recent experiments of an
English scientist. His name is Dr. D. J. Russell and
he is a lecturer on chemistry at St. Bartholomew's
Hospital, London. His work has caused no little
talk in English scientific circles and among the growing
host of photographers, amateur and professional.
Dr. Russell announces that he has discovered that cer
tain substances are able to produce exact images of them
selves on a photographic plate, even, though the substance
and the plate are kept in total darkness.
Some feAv years ago the great French chemist Becquerel
proved that if the metal uranium, or some of its salts, were
placed on a photographic plate in perfect darkness and al
lowed to remain there for some days, the plate became act
ed upon, the action manifesting itself by the ordinary
photographic process of development. This curious fact re
mained almost unnoticed until Dr. Russell discovered, while
repeating Becquerel's experiment, that mercury, magne
sium, cadmium, zinc, nickel, aluminum, pewter, fusible
metal, lead, bismuth, tin, cobalt and antimony all give off
rays capable of reproducing an image of the metal on a
photographic plate when placed in company with it in a
drawer, or other place where light cannot have effect, for a
few days.
A polished piece of zinc â that is, well rubbed with coarse
sand paper â if laid on a highly sensitive photographic plate
in a dark cupboard will, under certain conditions, even in
four or five hours, so act on it that on development a com
plete picture of the zinc is produced, showing the scratches
or any ruled linea and faint pattern drawn oa it. if

He found she was staying with Lady Minever at Hedham
Towers, and I wont over and invited her with a little
party. She's a Miss Desborough."
The Consul grave a slight start, and was aware that
Beverdale was looking at. him. "Perhaps you know her?"
said Beverdale.
"Just enough to agree with you that she is charming,"
said the Consul. "I dined with them and saw them at the
consulate."
"Oh, yes; I always forget you are a Consul. Then, of
course you know all about them. I suppose they're very
rich, and in society over there?" said Beverdale, in a voice
that was quite animated.
It was on the Consul's lips to say that the late Mr.
Desborough was an Englishman, and even to speak play
fully of their proposed quest, but a sudden instinct with
hold him. After all. perhaps it was only a caprice, or ldoa,
they had forgotten â perhaps, who knows?â that they were
already ashamed of. They had evidently "got on" in En
g];sh society, if thi.it was their real intent, and doubtless
.Miss Desboroufh by this time was quite as content with
the chance of becoming related to the Earl of Beverdale,
through his son and heir, Algernon, as if they found a real
Lord Desborouuh among their own relatives. The (Consul
knew that Lord Beverdale was not a rich man. that like
most men of old family he was not a slave to class preju
dice; Indeed, the Consul had seen very few noblemen off
the stage or out of the pages of a novel who were. So
he said, with a slight affectation of authority, that there
was as little doubt iof the young lady's wealth as there
was of her personal attractions.
They were nearing the house through a long avenue
of chestnuts, whi*' 1 variegated leaves were already begin
ning to strew the ground beneath, and they could see the
vista open upon the yellow October sunshine lightening up
the mullioned windows of the priory. In the sunshine,
dr<?s?<r:d in a shooting suit, stood a tall, clean-limbed young
fellow, whom the Consul recognized at once as Lord Al
gernon, the son of his companion. As if to accent the
graces of this vision of youth and vigor, near him. in the
shadow, an old man b,ad halted, hat in hand, still holding
the rake with which he had b-en gathering the dead l<:a v eÃ
in the avenue, his back bent, partly with years, partly

marked in this contrast, in this old man standing in the
shadow of the fading year, himself as dried and withered
as the leaves he was raking, yet pausing to make his rev

the presence of his coming master, that tne Consul, as
they swept by, looked after him with a stirring- of pain.

non, "and I think Is getting a little queer in his head. He
has n trick of slopping .and staring .straight ahead at
times, when he seems to go off for a minute or two.
There," continued the young man with a light laugh, "I
say! he's doing It now:" They both turned quickly and
gaze.! at the bent figure, not fifty yards awayâ standing in
exactly the same attitude as before. But even as they
gazed, he slowly lifted his rake and began his monotonous
wurk again.
At Scrooby Priory the Consul found that the fame of
his fair countrywoman had, indeed, preceded her, and
that the other guests were quite as anxious to see Miss
Desborough as he was. One of them had already met her
in London, another knew her as one of the house party at
the Duke of Northforeland's, where she had been a cen
tral ligure. Some of her naive sallies and frank criticisms
were repeated with great unction by the gv-ntlemen, and
with some slight trepidation and a "fearful Joy" by the
ladies. He was more than ever convinced that mother
and daughter had forgotten their lineal Desboroughs, and
he resolved to leave any allusion to it to the young lady
herself.
She, however, availed herself of that privilege the
evening after her arrival. "Who'd have thought of meet-
Ing you here?" she said, sweeping her skirts away to m:ike
room for him on a sofa, "It's a coon's age since I saw
youâ not since you gave us that letter to those genea
logical gentlemen in London."
The Consul hoped It had proved successful.
"Yes, but maw guessed we didn't care to go back to
Hengist and Horsa, and when they let loose a lot of 'Deb
boroughs' and 'Daybrooks' upon us maw kicked: We've
got a drawing ten yards long, that looks like a sour apple
tree, with lots of Desboroughs hanging up on the branches
like last year's pippins, and I gu^ss atout as worm-eaten,
rat well enough, but when it came to giving us
a mop of straight lines and dashes with names written
under them like an old Morse telegTaph slip struck by
lightning, then maw and I guessed that it made us tired."
"You know," she went on, opening her clear gray eyes
on the Consul, with a characteristic flash of shrewd good
sense â through her quaint humor â "we. never reckoned
where this thing would land us, and we found we were
paying Â£100. not only for the Desboroughs, nut all the peo
ple they'd married, and their children, and children's chil
dren, and there were a lot of outsiders we'd never heard
of, nor wanted to hear of. Maw once thought she'd got on
the trail of a Plantagenet, and followed It T keen, until she
found she had been reading the dreadful thing upside
down. Then we concluded we wouldn't take any more
stock in the family until it had risen."
During this speech the Consul could not help noticing
that although her attitude was playfully confidential to
him, her voice really was pitched high "enough to reach
the ears of smaller groups around her, who were not only
following her with the intensest admiration, but had
shamelessly abandoned their own conversation and had
even faced toward her. Was she really posing in her nai
vette? There was a certain mischievous, even aggressive
consciousness in her pretty eyelids. Then she suddenly
dropped both eyes and voice, and said to the Consul in a
genuine aside: "I like this sort of thing much better."
The Consul looked puzzled. "What .sort of thing?"
"Why. ull those swell people, don't you see; their pic
tures on the walls, this elegant room, everything that nas
cept a few lieutenants and took to the
savannas â great trackless prairies,
swampy, with occasional high bits of
land called "mattes." Here Aguinaldo
made his headquarters. At one time |
he must have had 4000 or 5000 men un- |
der arms of some sort hidden in these j
fastnesses, raiding the rich settlements
whenever they felt like it. The politi- j
cal governor general of the Philippines, j
Ser.or Don Basilio Augufstin y Pavila,
Offered a reward of $20,000 for the head
of Aguinaldo. Within a week he re
ceived a note from the insurgent chief
saying: "I need the sum you offer very
much and will deliver the head my
self."
Ten days later the southeast typhoon
was raging. The hurricane â for it was
one â was tearing things to bits, and I
it was raining, as it can rain only in
the Orient, a sheet of black, water
flooding the earth. The two sentinels
at the Governor General's gate made
the usual reverent sign as a priest
passed in, who asked if his Excellency
was within and unengaged. They an
swered yes to both questions. Don
Basilio did not turn his head as some
one entered. It was his secretary, he
supposed, come â¦<â > help prepare an elo
ouent statement upon the condition of
the colonies. It was not the secretary,
but a priest, who said: "Peace be with i
you, my son."
The cleric locked the door, and, drop- |
pine: his cloak, said:
"Do you know me?"
Don Basilio did not know him. It

you knowâ ago. Seething you haven t to pick up
for yourself and worry over." . - Â
But here the Consul pointed out that the place Itself
was not "ancestral" as regarded the present earl, and that
even the original title of his predecessors had passed away
from It. "In fact, it came Into the family by one of those
'outsiders' you deprecate. But I daresay you d find the
place quite as comfortable with Lord Beverdale for a host
as you would if you had found out he were a cousin? he
added. ,
"Better," said the young lady, frankly. â -
"I suppose your mother participates in these prefer
ences?" said the Consul, with a smile.
"No," said Miss Desborough, with the same frankness,
"I think maw's rather cut up at not finding a Pesborough.
She was invited down hereâ but she's ratner Independent,
you knowâ she allowed I could take care of myselfâ
while she went off to stay with the old dowager Lady
Mistowe, who thinks maw a very proper womanly per
son. I made maw mad by telling her that just what
old Lady Mistowe would say of her cookâ for I can t stand
these people's patronage. However, I shouldn,t wonder if
I was invited here as a 'most original person.
But here Lord Algernon came up to implore her to sing
them one of "those plantation songs," and Miss Desbor
ough, with scarcely a change of voice or manner allowed
herself to be led to the piano. The Consul had little chance
to speak with her again, but he saw enough that evening
to convince, him that not only Lord Algernon was very
much in love with her, but that the fact htta been equally
and complacently accepted by the family and guests. That
her present visit was only an oportunity for a formal en
gagement was clear to every woman in the nouseâ ex
cepting, I fear, even the fair subject of gossip herself.
Yet she seemed so unconcerned and self-contained that the
Consul wondered if she really cared for Lord Algernon.
And having thus wondered, he came to the conclusion that
It didn't much matter for the happiness of so practically
organized a young lady if she loved him or not. -
It is highly probable that Mies Sadie Desborough had
not even gone so far as to ask herself that question. She
awoke the next morning with a sense of easy victory and
calm satisfaction that had. however, none of the trans
ports of affection. Her taste was satisfied by the love or a
handsome young fellowâ a typical Englishmanâ who, if not
exactly original nor ideal, was, she felt, of a universally
accepted "hall-marked" standard, the legitimate outcome
of a highly ordered, carefully guarded civilization, whose
repose was the absence of struggle or ambition, and even
whose regular features were not differentiated from the
rest of his class by any of those disturbing lines which
people call character. Everything was made ready for
her, without care or preparation; she had not even an
Ideal to realize or modify. She could slip without any jar
or dislocation into this life which was just saved from self
indulgence and sybaritic luxury by certain conventional
rules of activity and the occupation of amusement, which,
as obligations of her position, even appeared to suggest
the novel aspect of a duty! She could accept all this
without the sense of being an intruder in an unbroken lin
eage â thanks to the Consul's account of the Beverdales
Inheritance. She already pictured herself as the mistress
of this fair domain, the custodian of its treasures and tra-B
ditions, and the dispenser of its hospitalitiesâ out as sheÃ
conscientiously believed, without pride or vanity in her Pp-B
Bitlonâ only an intense and thoughtful appreciation of it.B
Nor did she dream of ever displaying it ostentatiously be-B
fore her less fortunaate countrywomen â the contrary, â 
she looked forward to their possible criticism of her cast-B
Ing off all trans-Atlantic ties witn an uneasy consciousness^
that was, perhaps, her nearest approach to patriotism. YetÃ
again, she reasoned that as her father was an Engllsh-B
man, she was only returning to her old home. As to herÃ
mother, she had already comforted herself by noticing cer-B
tain discrepancies in that lady's temperament, which ledÃ
her to believe that she herself alone Inherited her father's^
natureâ for her mother was, of course, distinctly Amerl-BJ
can! So little conscious was she of any charming snob-B]
bishness in this belief, that in her superb naivette sheÃJ
would have argued the point with the Consul, and em-1
ployed a wit and dialect that was purely American. â 
She had slipped out of the priory early that moralngÃJ
that she might enjoy alone, unattended and unciceroned.BJ
the aspect of that vast estate which might be hers fc,r theÃJ
mere accepting. Perhaps there was some instinct of dell-B
cacv in her avoiding Lord Algernon that morning; not!
wishing as she herself might have frankly put it, -'to takeÃ]
stock" of his Inheritance In his presence. As she passedÃ]
Into the garden through the low postern door she turned*]
to look along the stretching facade of the main bullding.BJ
with the high stained windows of Us banqueting nail andÃ]
the state chamber where a king had slept. Even in thatM
crisp October air, and with the green of its ivied battle-B]
ments against the gold of the distant wood, it seemed toB
lie in the languid repose of an eternal summer. She hur-BJ
ried on down the other terrace into the Italian garden, aÃ|
quaint survival of past grandeur, passed the great or-BJ
angary and numerous conservatories, making a crystalÃ|
hamlet in themselves, and seelncr everywhere the samA
luxury. But it was a luxury that she fancied was redeem< >fl|
from the vulgarity of ostentation by the long custom "tH
years and generations, so unlike the millionaire palaces otflj
her own land, and In her enthusiasm she even fancied itÃ|
was further sanctified by the grim monastic founders whcH
had once been content with bread and pulse in the crum-B|
Ming and dismantled refectory. In the plenitude of herÃJ
feelings she felt a slight recognition of some Beneficent be-BJ
ing who had rolled this golden apple at her feet, and felflj
as if she really should like to "do good" in her sphere. B|
It so chanced that, passing through a small gate in thrH
park, she saw walking, a little ahead of her, a young girH
whom she at once recognized as a Miss Ame.lyn, one of th<B|
gue^tse! *>jev- T.fi beioÂ»<\ Miss Desborough n-mfml.tT-BJ
that she played the accompaniment of one or two songs^B
upon the piano, and had even executed a long solo durin^B
the general conversation, without attention from th<fll
others, and apparently with little irritation to herself, subÃl
siding afterward into an armchair, quite on the fringe ofll
other people's conversation. She had been called "mn
dear" by one or two dowagers, and by her Christian namfl
by the Earl, and had a way of Impalpably mating out ofl
sfght at times. These trifles led Miss Desborough to con-Bl
elude that she was some kind of dependent or poor rela-M
tlon. Urn- was an opportunity to begin her work of . "do-BI
Ing good." She quickened her pace and overtook MisaÃJ
Amclyn. , H
"Let me walk with you?" she said graciously. Bl

walk together; wherever you're going is good enough foiflj

"I'm going as far as the village." sMd Miss Amelyn,^B
looking down doubtfully 'at Sadies smart French shoes ;^B
"if you care to walk so far." Sadie noticed that her com-^B
panion was more solidly booted, and that her straightMÃJ
short skirts, although less stylish than her own, had aH
certain character, better fitted to the freer outdoor life "'-B
the country. But she only said, however: "The village^B
will do." and gayly took her companion's arm. BB
"But I'm afraid you'll find It very uninteresting. foiÃÃ
I am going to visit some poor cottages," persisted MissÃl
Amelyn. with a certain timid ingenuousness of mannerH
which, however, was quite as distinct as Miss Desbor-BB
ough's bolder frankness. "I promised the rector's daugh-MBJ
ter to take her place to-day." Â«c BH
"And I feel as if I was ready to pour oil and wine toJJ â 
any extent," said Miss Desborough, f 'so come along!" BB
Miss Amelyn laughed, and yet glanced around her tim-BB
Idly, as if she thought that Miss Desborough ought to hav^BJ
a larger and more important audience. Then she eontin-Bi
ued more confidentially and boldly: "But it Isn't at all IIK^BJ
'slumming,' you know. These poor people nere are noH
very bad. and are not at all extraordinary." HBJ
"Never mind." said Sadie, hurrying her along. t After aBJ
pause she went on: "You know the pnory very well, BJ
guess?" '
"I lived there when I wa<Â» a little girl, with my auntÃJ
the Dowager Lady Beverdale." said Miss Amelyn. "Whei^BJ

"The Dower House?" repeated Sadie. BB]
"Yes, Lady Beverdale's separate property." BB|
"But I thought all this propertyâ the prioryâ came intiÃ
the family through her." â

condition, "and I claim the reward!

the matter myself."
Don Basilio was trapped. He had to
open his desk and cnunt out the sum
in Spanish gold. Aguinaldo punctili
ously wrote a receipt, coolly counted
the money and walked backward
toward the door. He suddenly opened
it and dashed out, just ahead of a pis
tol bullet that cut his locks on the tem

But Miss Desborough was adamant, though sparkling.
She thanked him. but said she had just seen an old woman
"who had been lying in bed for twenty years and ha, â t
spoken the truth once!" She proposed "going outside of
Lord Beverdale's own preserves of grain-red poor, and
starting up her own game. She would return in time for
luncheonâ if she could; if not, she "should annex the gruel
of the first incapable she met." displeased at being ac-
Yet actually, she was far from displeased at being ac
cidentally discovered by these people while following out
her capricious whim of the morning. One or two older
ladies, who had fought shy of her frocks and her frank
ness the evening before, were quite touched now by this
butterfly, who was willing to forego the sunlight of soci
ety, and soil her pretty wings on the haunts of the impov
erished with only a single companionâ of. her own sex.â
and smiled approvingly. And in her present state of mind,
remembering her companion's timid attitude toward Lord
Beverdale's opinions, she was not above administering this
slight snub to him in her presence.
When they had driven away, with many regrets, Miss
Amelyn was deeply concerned. "I am afraid,' she said,
with timid conscientiousness, "I have kept you from going
with them. And you must be bored with what you have
seen. I know. I don't believe you really care one bit for it
â and you are only doing It to please me."
"Trot out the rest of your show," said Sadie promptly,
"and we'll wind up by lunching with the rector."
"He'd be too delighted," said Miss Amelyn, with disas
ter written all over her girlish, truthful race, "butâ butâ
you knowâ it really wouldn't be quite right to Lord Bever
dale! You're his principal guestâ know! and-r-they'd
think I had taken you off."
"Well," said "Miss Desborough, impetuously, "what's
the matter with that Innâ the Bed Lion? We can get a
sandwich there, I guess. I'm not very hungry."
Miss Amelyn looked horrified for a moment, and then
i laughed, but immediately . became concerned again. "No!
listen to me, really now! Let me finish my round alone!
You'll have ample time If you go. now, to reach the priory
for luncheon. Do, please! It would be ever so much bet
ter for everybody. I feel quite guilty as it is, and I sup
pose I'm already in Lord Beverdale's black books!"
The trouble in the young girl's face was unmistakable,
and as it suited Miss Desborough's purpose just as well
to show her independence by returning, as she had set out,
alone, she consented to go. Miss Amelyn showed her a
short cut across the park, and they separatedâ to meet at
dinner. In this brief fellowship the American girl had
kept a certain supremacy and half-fascination over the
English girl, even while she was conscious or an invincible
character in Miss Amelyn entirely different from and su
perior to her own. Certainly there was a difference in the
two peoples. Why else this inherited conscientious rever
ence for Lord Beverdale's position, shown by Miss Amelyn
âwhich she, an Americanâ alive to its practical benefits
could not understand. Would Miss Amelyn and Lord Al
gernon have made a better match? The thought irritated
her, even while she knew that she. herselr, possessed the
young man's affections, the power to marry him, and, as
she believed, kept her own Independence In the matter

flaws in the metal exist they are clearly seen.
One of the must extraordinary points about these "pic
tures without light" is that absolute contact of me metal
and plate is not necessary. Dr. Russell found that if
screens of different thicknesses of any inactive substance
be interposed between plate and metal, thus preventing
contact, the action still occurs. While glass stops the ac
tion, celluloid, sheet gelatine, gutta percha, vegetable parch"
ment, real parchment, goldbeaters' skin, tracing paper and
various other substances have no effect, the resulting pic
ture of the zinc being as good as if they were not there
Dr. Russell finds aqueous vapor is not an active agent in
producing these reactions, but that alterations of tempera
ture produce very marked effects, high temperature in
creasing the photographic action of the substance, low tem
perature diminishing it.
Wood possesses a very considerable amount of photo
graphic activity, and any one may prove this for himself
Lay an ordinary smooth piece of wood on a photographic
plate, and, like the piece of zinc, it will impress its likeness
on the plate.
In one of his experiments Dr. Russell found that uran
ium salts acted more strongly shut in pill boxes than in
any other way, and this led him to place a pill box without
any uranium saJt on it on a photographic plate. To his as
tonishment he found that action had occurred, and that a
dark circular spot representing the pill box came out on the
plate.
Pill boxes are usually made of strawboard, and thi<* sub

In tangled manzanita thickets the
hen of the mountain quail fussed and
called to her half-fledged brood, tempt
ing Providence with her noisy scolding.
Doves and grouse and squirrels invited
shots, but the law protected the grouse
and we did not want the others badly
enough to shoot and scare the deer.
It was quite dark when we sat down
by our camp fire to our beans, bread
and butter and coffee. I was too tired
to stay long away from my bed of fra
grant spruce browse in the tent which
had been pitched for Minnie and me.
The last I heard was the voice of "Sure
Shot: "You ought to have been here
twenty years ago, the first trip I ever
made on this here mountain. Do you
set- that gulch over thar? Wall, I was
all tuckered out and hungry enough

them, and I guess I fired ten shots.

Then I fell asleep.
Between S and 9 o'clock next morning
we were eating breakfast when the
banters returned laden with only hun
ger and directions to Minnie and me
as to the surest way to br'ng down
four-point bucks.
Toward noon we too went to "stake
out" our ground. We were chatting
and making ourselves happy in a rasp

my heart was in my throat. We must
have made some sound, however, for
they bounded away up the hill. I
turned to Minnie, she was as white as
her collar and said I had even less
color. Then we sat down and had a
good laugh.
When we returned to camp we did
not tell the others what we had seen
though the lust of the chase grew in
us every hour. We merely said we had
chosen the side of the mountain for
the morrow's hunting.
"All right, you shall have that whole
mountain for your own. Don't tire
yourselves too much though, and I
would not get up till it is quite light

the deer and don't lose yourselves."
The nights are very cold up on Bald
Mountain. Very early next morning
when Minnie whispered to me that she
believed it was time to get up nothing
but those deer we had actually seen
could have moved me. It was very
dark, but along the line of the east was
a promise that it might be light some
time.
The men were still sleeping so we
had the first chance at the cold coffee
before we started over the hill which
had been so generously given to us.
I carried the rifle and Minnie a pair
of -field glasses. Something was mov

â  With the destruction of so many of
! Snain's warships and cruisers at Ma
nila and Santiago de Cuba there re
mained little or no fear of an attack on
our seacoast cities, and hence the mines
were permitted to be removed.
However, the mines in the harbor of
San Francisco are to remain undis

to take them up. So says Major Win.

Soon after the breaking out of the |

Our berry patch was about a mile
from camp over a long ridge of Bald

keep very close together. The snap

j the harbor in the least, but if the entire
I field Is laid according to the plans the
network might interfere to sÂ»mi> extent
with the transportation interests. A
vessel passing over the mine field
I might strike a mine and cause an ex
plosion.
The mines are so arranged that any
particular one can be exploded at the
will of the operator stationed on the
shore; but if touched by a vessel the
mine by means of an ingenious device
announces the fact to the operator and
at the same time automatically throws
the firing battery into circuit, causing
an explosion.
It has been stated in the newspaper
dispatches that the harbor mines if re
moved would either be taken up or
blown off. Major Heuer, however, says
that there would be no blowing off of
the mines as they are too expensive to
be converted into a mere fireworks dis
play.
The mines in the harbor of San Fran
cisco so far have cost over $500,000.
The plan for completely mining the
harbos calls for 1000 mines, the cost of
which will be over $1,000,000.
The mine cases are made of steel,
six feet long, thirty-two inches diame
ter and containing from 100 to 600
pounds of dynamite.

yond the brook and sat flown to wait.
It was fast growing light and we had
heard several distant shots. Watch
ing in every direction we fell to won
derlng if we would have to ?ro home
without so much as a sight of deer. A
strained intent look came into Minnie's
face. Following her t-yes I saw not
a hundred yards away a buck feeding
in the shadow of the tanbark oaks
which skirted the opening. He was
partly facing us and much lower down.
I was almost afraid to raise my rille
into position lest he should hear us. I
took a long, careful aim at the point of
his shoulder, where the light struck it,
and fired.
Major Heuer, if ordered to remove
them, would' disconnect the electrical
i apparatus at the shore and thon grap
ple for the mines, picking: them up
one by one. The cable would be cut
immediately beneath, and then under
run and reeled up, the principal cable
thus being taken away. The charge
would then be taken out of the mine
and stored away for future wars, as
the material will last, in good condi
tion, for many years. The life of the
wires is about two years, at the end
of which period they will have to be
replaced.
To the casual observer it would seem
that the Golden Gate would have been
the proper location for the harbor
mines, as it is only about a mile wide,
and would require the placing of about
fifty-three torpedoes, but the trouble
Is that the Golden Gate is too deep,
and too rapid. It is 320 feet deep
and"the current at times is eight miles
an hour. The depth of the Golden Gate
prevents the use of ground mines, as
it would Interfere with the destructive
force of the explosive, and the strong
When the slight smoke of the nitro
powder had cleared away no buck lay
on the ground. We ran down the hill
to where he had stood and there was
a great smear of dark blood and on
the grass plashes of blood a few feet
apart, leading back into the woods, and
there over a fallen trunk the buck.
He was a "four-pointer," just what
I had promised myself. The small
head on the long slender neck stretched
on the dead leaves, the great brown
eyes still soft and unglazed and the
free, wild grace of the body and dol
icately shaped legs, made me feel like
a murderess, as I, trembling, stooped
to see if there was any life.
I wonder if men who have killed a
current makes it difficult for the plac
ing of buoyant mines.
The mires now dotting part of San
Francisco Kay are of the buoyant type,
their buoyancy being due to a large
air chamber. They are anchored so
that they float only a few feet beneath
the surface of the water. The buoyant
torpedo being nearer the object of at
tack does not require nearly so large
a charge of explosive as the ground
mine.
The submarine mines in the harbor of
San Francisco, so far as the system is
completed, are placed within an area
embraced within lines drawn from Sau
salito- to a green buoy south of Belve
dere, and Angel Island, thence to Shag
Rock, and thence to Point Cavallo, as
shown by the accompanying drawing.
"Very recently," stated Lieutenant
deer feel as I did.
After all the trouble, packing over
the mountains, walking: for miles, all
the heat and rough living, I would
have given a great deal to be able to
give back to my first deer the power
to bound away into God's green
woods.
As we started back the sun was
lighting the fog in the lower valleys
and the whole mountain side was
awake and alive. It seemed hours
since we had picked our way over that
trail through the deathlike silence and
chilly gloom.
"Sure Shot" came in soon with no
game, but a wondrous story, and
Peter, the dog, close at his heels, one
eye closed and his pinky white hide
frescoed with tar weed which he de
cently tried to wash off in our spring
set aside for drinking.
I asked how Peter had hurt his eye.
" 'Taint hurt; all them well-bred dorgs
have that way of looking," answered
"Sure Shot." as he wiped his knife on
his trousers, preparatory to eating his
breakfast. The vultures were circling
around and around the spot where my
deer lay and yellow jackets were hum
ming and buzzing, eager to dispute
'Sure Shot's" right to fasten the buck
onto the mule with what he called a
"hog-thief's hitch."
He was not half so patronizing when
he found that the one shot from my
little Winchester had gone through the
heart and out through the short ribs.
He stepped off the distance from where
the buck lay to the first stain of blood,
and it was eighty-seven yards. The
buck had traveled that distance and
jumped a great fallen tree after a bul
let had torn through his heart.
Shunk, the officer in charge of the
mines, "the propeller of a steamer cut
the cable holding a torpedo, which
floated out beyond the heads and was
brought back by some fishermen. If
a vessel had struck it there miÂ£ht have
been a repetition of the Maine disas
ter."
Two weeks ago four lads from San
Francisco hired a boat and went row
ing. They pulled their boat alongside
a torpedo buoy and began to poke ft
with their oars, evidently unaware of
Its dangerous nature. A guard rushed
down to the shore and shouted to the
boys, who yelled back uncomplimentary
remarks and tried to pull the buoy
from its moorings. At this four rifle
balls were sent over their heads, where
upon they rowed back to Sausalito.

ONE thing is certain, Diogenes would never have won !
his renown in Paxis. In less than a week he would
have made a bonfire of his dear old tub, smashed
his lantern In gieeful exuberance and tripped the
trolley on the Place de la Kepublique. For here,
life is plainly worth the living and philosophy mu?t
perish. From the top of the Eiffel tower to the darkest re
cess of the Bewers, Paris is gay, laughing throbbing with
the joy of lift.-. If there be anyone here who is really miser
able I have not yet discovered him and I Wave peered into
the faces of the poor and the lowly with real psychological
Intent. One feels that the forlorn expression or the beggar
Is only a disguised smile, that his plaint is a possible laugh.
' There Is no doubt about it. Joy in- Paris is real, hearts are i
â¢ light and life is marvelously rosy.
The Parisian temperament is essentially, irrepressibly
gay, and happiness, after ail, is surely a question of ter
nâ¢ j erament rath.-r than of condition. No, the poor of Paris
are not to be pitiedâ they have eyes that were made to see ;
-with, feet to danco, lips to kiss, and what matters all the i
t! Eat, drink and be merry, for to-day we live, is the â 
philosophy of the Parisian, that to-morrow we die has not ;
yet been revealed to them.
On account of these characteristics a fete in Paris as-
sumes a color that is a decided revelation to us from across
the ocean, and the fete of the people the 14th of July
'shows the unvarnished Parisian temperament more than
any other occasion. 1 must confess that I had not much
Interest In the 14th of July. My American imagina
tion refused to suggest anything else but firecrackers, a
procession of soldi*-; in the morning, some very prosaic
literary exercises, ai d at night a "grand pyrotechnic dis

different. It is for I : ie and Is literally by the people.

other for the annual outlet of the "1 am as good as you"
sentiment.
On the day of the 14th all of tho theaters are open
free, from the Grand Opera-house to the humblest institution
In Paris, and the Jam commences about the entrances at
3or 4 o'clock in the morning. The marble halls of the opera
become the scene of a barbecue, for the peasants take ilv-ir
meals and camp till the doors are open. The celebration
really lasts two pr three days, fur the city Is enlivened j
â with all the traveling shows of Europe. Circuses of every
description, monstrosities, merry-go-rounds, trolleys, fer

hundreds. And the Satids of music, hand organs and street |
Bingers constitute a din indescribable.
The most important event of the 14th is always
the review of the army by the President of the republic,
which takes place at Longchaxnps. Although it did not
begin on this 14th till 3 o'clock in the afternoon, by
noon every 8.-at was occupied. Next to God the Father

the effort to any one, for the spectacle is superb. Twenty
seven thousand soldiers in the gayest of uniforms took part
in the review. However, an American intelligence can
easily picture army reviews and things of that sortâ lt is
harder to imagine the balls in the streets which are features
of the Paris celebration.
On the night of the 14th there were fully one hun
dred balls en the street corners of Paris. Fortunately, trie
ts are nearly all beautifully paved, but oven when such
is not the case the gaiety is not affected. Cobble stones are
no impediment when a Parisian wants to dance. All om
nibuses and trams are stopped on this occasion, that the
fun may not be interrupted, and carriages may come only
within a certain distance.
A stalwart escort is very important to the lady who
would view these sights without taking part. Unless so
accompanied she must become the partner in the dance or
any one who grabs her. The Government, it is said, expends
thousands of dollars in illuminating the city on this occa
sion, a statement that can reaJily be believed. There were
literally draperies of electric lights, glittering flags, ban
ners and stars on the opera house, the Hotel de Ville and
all the public buildings in Paris. The largest of the balls
were before these places, the opera and the Hotel de Ville,
but there were numerous others not less interesting. The one
in the Latin Quarter naturally had a character of its own.
Trilby was there and Little Billee, as well as Rodolphe and
Musette, for these individuals are permanent in the Latin
Quarter. Yes, and Taffy and Schaunard were quite conspic
uous, carrying their ladies on their shoulders. Poor Mur
ger! lam thinking of his apologetic statements that there
are bridges in the I^atin Quarter, and that one can go
through mud without getting splashed. Perhaps that is
true, but to the looker-on the bridges are not apparent,
while the splashes are sorrowfully conspicuous.
At 1 o'clock we had visited ten different balls, quitting
with the one at the opera, which was undoubtedly the most
brilliant in town. Here we found women with high-heeled
boot:-, petticoats of real lace and hats with drooping plumes
dancing furiously with butchers and bakers still clad in
their caps and aprons. Next to them you would have rec
ognized your domestic in the embrace of a bare-legged stu
dent, and further on your blanchisseuse radiant with ec
stacy on the arm of some one to whom she could not speak
a word, an American undoubtedly, clad in a costume ap
propriate for a Fifth avenue promenade. Men danced with
each other by way of variety, and often a women would
take the notion to dance alone. Perhaps her hair would be
gray and her poor old hands shriveled with the toil of many
years, but feet do not grow old in Paris, and hers would
compete quite nobly with the Hying slippers of the gay co
quet. Over all this mixture of kitchen aprons and lacy
skirts, of black coats and unclean blouses, ascended innu
merable little balloons of every color of the rainbow.
There were green lions, pink elephants, yes, and purple
cows in dazzling array, as well as all sorts of noisy con
ceits, singing birds, bleating sheep and squealing dwarfs.
Tin â¢[â <â  were vendors of live birds, who plunged into the
dance with the little tame creatures on their hats and
shoulders; truly they were the tamest and the grayest
things In all the scene, these piping birds, and they, the
Parisian tells me, were doped.
The balls lasted till 7 o'clock In the morning, and the
15th was again a holidayâ a resting day.

prayer:
"Dr. Liddon told me of a Presbyter

VOICE CULTURE
AS A FINE ART
WILLIAM L. TOMLINS, the Well-Koown Educator In Music.
Mr. Tomllns. leader of the Apollo Club of Chicago and of the chorus of
children that sang at the World's Fair, has lately resigned his various po
sitions and is to give all of his time to work among children. His reputation
is national for the success he has had In developing and training voices. Mr.
Tomlins. though, carries his teaching of music much farther than simple
voice culture.
TTT L. TOMLINS' theory, broadly,
1/1/ is this: That the musical in
1/1/ stinct is well nigh universal
I I and the song voice a common
' * â¢ heritage; that as man becomes
more and more a cog in the
great industrial machine and can no
longer delight in the work of his hands
his spiritual deadness and discontent
become a menace to future genera
tions, but through music shall he find
the salvation of expression for his
dormant energies; that the mental,
moral and physical power of music is
irresistible, immortal, and in this con
nection he acknowledges its some
time power for evil, as any good
thing may be misused; and, lastly, that
the self-unconsciousness of children
renders them the fittest medium for the
reception and discrimination of this

hopes to live till every little one in
America can rightly use the voice God
gave him.
"What ground is there for the popu
lar notion that it is hurtful to the
adult voice to teach a child to sing?"
I asked. "There are many people sin
cerely in doubt on the subject.
"Absolutely no ground at all," replied
Mr. Tomlins. "It is this way: In fig
ures one can roughly represent the
value of the voices, at 7, 6 and 3 and
the value of the child's voice is exactly
the same, during all the years from 7
to 13, or 13%.
"Then at 13 years comes the rest
period," Mr. Tomlins continued. "The
child is a creature neither boy nor man,
a being without a name, and Just as
his voice wavers and wobbles so Is his
emotional machinery at the same trail

sitional stage, for there is the most in
timate and powerful connection be
tween the voice and the emotions, and
that is, indeed, where the strength of
music lies. But after two, or perhaps
three years, he can sing freely again.
Incalculably the better for his early
training, and his voice will catch up
with his feet during the resting time, at
about the rate of one year's growth in
a month."
'What about the girls. Mr. Tomlins?"
"A girl's voice needs rest, too, and for
the same reasons, but with her there
Is not so marked a change. There is
another thing about the child-voice
which has not been sufficiently noted
by the teachers of children, and that
is its naturally high compass. The
mans voice below, the woman's voice j
between and the child's above is the i
order of nature. I have taken a thou- |
sand children from the streets and
slums of Chicago, from the poorest,
hardest lives, and within a few months
they have sung, with utmost ease, the
high C, time and again, before hun
dreds of astonished hearers. But it
is the spirit of song which average j
teachers most lamentably miss; they !
don't know where to look for it. It is
within, within, and they work from j
without, trying to force an unfamiliar
phantasm of their own imagination into
the mouth of a child, when the golden
germ is within the heart of every one
of them.
"Then the children must be taught to
use both mind and heart in their sing
ing. Singing only from the heart is
like the flying of a bird with one wing
âhe flops. But given the balance of
mind, the child wings his way to the
highest earth knows.
"When I first get hold of a class of
children taught to sing in the old way
I have difficulty in shaking the self
consciousness out of them. I have
sometimes to resort to the queerest
methods of putting it to flight.
"As to those who wish to play some
instrument, as well as use their voices,
I ask often that they take up the vio
lin or 'cello; fhat with the numberless
pianos some form of chamber music
shall be open to them. There is noth
ing like chamber music for keeping the
home together and the son from the
saloon. Then along with the love of
music we try to teach the worship of
nature; the love of beautiful scenery;
the grace of bending flowers and bril
liant butterflies; the aerial flight
of birds; the music of poetry
and pictured loveliness; the bÂ»auty of
men and women and little children;
then, and then only, can the supreme
love for one, which later comes, come
safely, naturally and normally: for
when the love of all things beautiful
finds but one object on which to spend
Itself It is rt.ther a monster than an
angel of light!"
Lafcadio Hearn, by the way, voices
much the same opinion in his irritat
lngy apt paper on the "Eternal Femi
nine" In an ancient Atlantic Monthly,
but his is the directly masculine vis
ion, from which the feminine stand
point is most cruelly withheld. Strong

also; but his strength is tempered with
tenderness and his is the quick intui
tion and sympathy of the best women.
It Is hard to believe in his 54 years, as
one looks into the bright, brown,
young face, and sees the thick waves
of dark hair hardly touched with gray;
and the tremendous nervous' energy,
the vital, magnetic power of the man
are rarely associated in our mind
with the approach to threescore years.
Before leaving Mr. Tomlins I of
course asked his opinion of the Cali
fornia voice, and he had many nice
things to say concerning its beauty,
which I here patriotically pass on.
"The spontaneity and freshness of the
California voice delighted and sur
prised me on my visit here three years
ago," he answered. "There is much
less self-consciousness here than in the
East â that bugbear of music. Perhaps
a newer civilization accounts for it."
"We thought our climate" â I be
gan.
"Climate has some effert doubtless,"
said Mr. Tomlins, smiling, "but lan

France, the lovely liquids of Italy and

One .of these "throats" of white chiffon

dangling from It to which was suspended
a large solitaire diamond. The whole had
the strange appearance of being a dia

mentioned in the beginning, some lati

â¢ lialr. \n: curled in the nape of the neck

ment Is formed by waving the hair
throughout Its entire length. The back is
tied in the middle of the head and is
* heap.e'd into a net. The net Is pinned at
the -middle of - the head, forming an old
â¢fashioned chignon. The chignon fails low
enough to cover the back of the neck.

Few women are courageous enough
1 now to brush the hair back from the
j ears. No artist ever drew a fancy picture
which showed the top of the ears. Only
the lobe peeps out, as shown in the mod
els or Raphael and Gainsborough, those
j two painters who knew a woman when
I they saw one. The curls can be few or
many, but they are more becoming to the
wearer than the plain, bare ears.
With the low neck the hair can be
curled in a bang, and pulled down over
the forehead a la Princess of Wales. This
style is decidedly becoming to women
j who are a little past their youth.

SECOND BEST
NEW HAT.
j? F you have just expended $5 or $(! for
a new hat for the summer, no doubt
j[ you feel that it is aU. that you can
afford to have; yet with so many dif
ferent colored linings to your summer
dresses how can you possibly make the
one hat do? A young woman who is
quite clever in the matter of dress and
Whose purse does not hold a superabund
ance of change for the carryiiy? out of
her idea*, has adopted a plan which is
quite worthy of being copied.
She had a broad, white leghorn hat
which she wore last summer, and which,
while being completely out of style, was
too good to be put aside. She secured a
package of diamond dye for 10 cents,
dyed the hat a beautiful shade of quartz
gray, and after it had dried thoroughly
she cut off about two inches of the brim.
Then she put three rows of crinoline
around it. arranging the crinoline around
it so that it stood high in the back, after
which she covered the first row with a
double fold of quartz gray chiffon, the
second with a deep panne fold and the
third she treated as the first. Under the
brim in the back and over the end of the
rows in the front, she massed bunches
of white and panne violets. The crino
line made a foundation for theÂ«"hiflton so
that In case it were to get wet it would
not fall flimsy around the brim and thus
destroy its beauty.
Any "nut can be remodeled in this way
and by changing the trimming occasional
ly you can have several new hats during
tne summer.
MILITARY
TRIMMINGS.
_______ I
mILITARY trimmings for women's I
/fun wear are being manufactured '
! ft ]fiÂ± \ for the fall gowns, and a few
fashionable girls have got hold i
jof some of them. They are epaulets, ad
: jutant's cordings and bandmaster's array
of gold braid and trappings. One girl has
a cloth suit of hussar blue, with an Eton i
| jacket with slender black revers and
I straps of gold and black braid on each
! sid/ 1 . as well as at the wrists of the very !
i small sleeves. The black collar and belt
| are fastened with gilt buttons, and a -vest
of yellow chamois is fastened with smaller
; gilt buttons. The skirt has graduated
; lengths of the black and gold braid on
I each side.
1 have already mentioned the fact that
J
a few silk petticoats with "lingerie"
flounces had been shown. They will soon
be the only correct thing with fashionable
women. In Paris several sets of lace
trimmed ruffles come for each silk petti
coat. Fashionables can not renounce the
rustle of the silk, yet must have the soft
and dainty fullness of white lawn and
lace. The silk petticoat itself has only
one full, but not deep, flounce to sustain
the one of washing material. Up to this
time the effect desired would have been
gained by wearing another skirt, but that
would add to the *:ze of the figure above
the knees, which would be bad style. It
Is only from the knees down that we must
flare.
One of the preltiest items that has
caught my eye this week is a blouse coat
in the finest fawn-colored cloth, trimmed
with appliques of panne, a kind of plush
velvet, or. perhaps, more nearly allied to
the silk of which gentlemen's hats are
made. It formed a pattern on the back
and round the shallow basque. It was

Questions will be answered in th ese columns. Sign any name that you choose and address all commu

IN all ages, poets have sung arjd lovers
raved, over the eyes, the "windows of
the soul." They are the most deli
cate and complex organs of the body,
and require the most considerate
treatment, and yet how few people take
even reasonable care of them. There Is
no greater misfortune that could befall
one than to be deprived of sight. Think
of it! What It would meaii to you to be
shut out from all the beautiful things of
the world, to feel but not see the blessed
sunshine, never to catch a glimpse, of the.
blue of the heavens, or the variegated
loveliness of the flowers; to hear the
voices of loved one, while darkness rests
upon their faces; for this is what blind
ness means, and yet how many people
endanger their sight by carelessness and
by overtaxing the eyes.
The mechanism of the eye is all the
more wonderful because of the diminu
tive size of the window through which, at
a single glance, one comprehends a multi
tude of glories reaching out In every di
rection.
It is not necessary to enter Into any
minute description of the anatomy of the
eye. Every one knows that its princi
pal divisions are: The cornea, which Is
ordinarily known as the white of the eye;
the iris, which is the colored circle sur
rounding the pupil; the pupil; the retina,
a plate at the back of the .-ye which re
ceives refracted Impressions through the
lens from the pupil; and the optic nerve,
which is the medium of communi.
between the external world and the brain.
The eyelids are curtains completely ex
cluding the eye from the outer world.
The margins of these lids are lined with
short curved hairs, the eyelashes, which
serve as a screen to protect the eyes from
dust. Above the eye is a bony ridge, also
covered wfth a line of short, thick hairs,
which carry the perspiration around the
eye.
The eye is a Complete optical instru
ment, a camera of the same kind as that
used by artists In making sun pictures,
but intiintely more perfect than any in
strument which human Ingenuity and
skill has yet produced.
The beauty of the face depends very
greatly upon the size, color hthl condition
of the eye. The general health has much
to do with the appearance of the eye
and the condition of the eyesight, so first
of all attention to the general laws of
health is necessary together with con
stant care and economy in the use of
this delicate organ.
Washing the eyes, night and mornirtg,
in hot w;iter is a wonderful tonic. Dry
them always with a soft towel, wiping in
ward toward the nose and never outward,
as this has a tendency to collect crow:;'
feet. Take care in drying to press upon
and flatten the eyeball, as a flattening of
the Jens of the eye Is considered a sign of
approaching old age. and will call for
glasses sooner than nature Intended,
Here are a few "don'ts" for those who
wish to retain their sight and keep their
eyÂ«?s in healthy condition:
Don't read or sow by twilight or by a
the washing gowns thlr. year. I Tore is I
one I must not omit to tÂ«-ll you about: A
rose-tinted linen of the same make that"
we associate with butcher blue, but of
the most exquisite pink coloring, I
have seen made with three round :d
fluuncM on the skirt, piped with white, ;
By Mrne. Hygeia.
Hickering or insufficient light.
Don't read In a reclining position.
Don't read In a moving train or car
riage.
Don't read books with very line print.
Don't read or work, facing the light.
The light should fall over the left shoul
der or from behind.
Don't expose the eye too suddaalv to a
very brilliant light.
Don't use your eyes before breakfast,
as the strain on the optic nerve will se
riously affect the sight.
Don't read when extremely weary. And
as soon ns the eyes begin to tire or a
mist comes over them, at that instant
put aside your book or work.
Whereas any serious trouble with the
eyes should call for an immediate visit
to a skilled oculist, there are a few
simple home remedies that may be safe
ly used in such difficulties as weak and
inflamed eyes, sty, etc.
An excellent wash for weak and in
flamed eyes Is made from equal parts of
witch-hazel and camphor water. Bathe
the eyes in this several times a day until
relieved.
An alum paste, made by rubbing a
small piece of alum into the white of
an egg until a curd is formed, is good j
fur granulated lids. Apply to the lids t
upon retiring at right, and tie a piece;
of soft linen over the eyes. /
One grain of yellow oxide of mercury '
mixed with thick, sweet cream will often
reduce a very serious inflammation of
the lids and is also excellent for a sty.
'I'll-- subject of the eyes is not com
plete without a few words as to the cul-'
tivation of the eyebrows and lashes.
To keep the eyebrows nice, trim once
in a while the tiniest bit and apply a
quinine wash made by mixing live grains
sulphate of quinine in one ounce of al
cohol. Urush them frequently with a
soft camel's hair brush. If a deeper
shade Lb desired claret may be safely
used. However, do not use this on tho
eyelashes. To make these grow clip an
Infinitesimal point, and apply a tonic
made of equal parts of cocoanut oil and
whitn vaseline. This is also good for the
eyebrows.
And now, remember this, all of you who
want bright eyes. The beauty of the
eye lies chiefly In the expression, and
this can be easily cultivated. Nothing
will brigliten th" eyes like a bright, orig
inal mind. Show interest and bright
ness in the face, and I assure you that
the eyes will shine and scintillate as did
the star of Bethlehem, and will be to all
wise men the pymfool of a sweet, intelli
gent mind, before whose radiance slight
irregularities of feature will instantly
vanish.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
EDlTHâ Please don't apologize for
wrfttng to me so often. I will cheerfully
answer as many questions as you please
to put to me. That Is what I am here for.
All advertisements sound plausible, but
there is so much charlatanry in that sort
of thing that I think, as a rule, the more
high-sounding they are and the more
miracles they profess to perform the
safer it is to be wary of them. I have j

read at least half a dozen advertisements
that claim exactly the same thing as this
one. that you have sent me, and they each
and every one of them claim to be the
"only sure cure." The quotations in
your letter were taken from a book that
was published twenty-five years ago, bo
the remedies suggested are somewhat be
hind the times, and you will notice that
each assertion is qualified with the words
"It is said." I am afraid I cannot hold
out to you anything more comforting
than I have said to you in previous let
ters. Is the growth too heavy for the
electric needle? I should stop -orrying
and experimenting if I were you, and just
make myself so charming and attractive
'hat people would never think of my one
facial defect; and. besides, I doubt if it
is half as apparent to others as it seems
to be to you.
TROUBLESâ It really Is discouraging
to be called upon to prescribe for some
one who has tried "almost every remedy
under the sun." and to no avail. I hon
estly believe that the orange flowor sk:n
food, which I have several times siven
recipe fur would help you. But, as you
say, creams do not seem to agree with
your skin, I wish \<>u would try this,
which is splendid for the ski a:
A READER-I answered your letter as
soon as I possibly could, and you, no
doubt, received it shortly after mailing
your second one to me. Letters, to re
ceive an answer in the following Sun
day's paper, should be in The Call office
by Tuesday night.
BELLEâ The skin food is made from th<,
following Ingredients:
Spermaceti, V- ounce.
White wax, VÂ£ ounce.
Sweet almond oil, 1 ounce.
Lanollne, 1 ounce.
Cocoanut oil, 1 ounce.
Tincture of benzoin, 2 drops.
Orange flower water, 1 ounce.
Melt the first live ingredients In a por
celain kettle. When thoroughly incor
porated remove from the fire and" add the
benzoin and orange flower water, stir
ring rapidly until cold. Put In little
white jars. I know of nothing better in
the way of a Bkin whitener than cucum
ber milk, made after this recipe: Oil of
sweet almonds, 4 ounces; fresh cucumber
juice (.boiled), 10 ounces; white castile
soap. ] 4 ounce. Dissolve in 3 ounces of
essence of cucumbers and 1-20 ounce of
simple tincture of benzoin. Cut the cu
cumbers in small pieces, neither peeling
nor removing the seeds, and pour on just
enough water to start them to cooking.
When cooked soft and mushy strain
through a piece of muslin. You can make
the essence yourself by taking one and
one-half ounces of alcohol and one and
one-half ounces of the boiled cucumber
juice. Add to this your castile soap and
let it stand for several hours until the
soap has entirely dissolved. Then put in
the cucumber juice which is strained and
cold. Shake well so that all are thor
oughly mixed and then add oil of sweet
almonds and the benzoin, stirring for
some time. Put in a bottle and shako
well brfnre vising. Apply it at night, let
tine It dry on the skin and rinsing away
in tepid water the following morning.
The natural arsenic In the cucumber
makes this a splendid face bleach, and the
beauty of it is that it is perfectly harm
less. For answer to your third question

OATMEAL LOTION.
Two tablespoonfuls fine oatmeal.
Boil and strain. When cold adÂ« 1:
One dessertspoonful of wine (white Rhine

reply. I always object to recommending
anything with which to dye the hair or
the eyebrows. It gives one such an un
cleanly, vulgar appearance, and yet I
know that dark, heavy brows do add to
one's good looks. Walnut dye is often
used for the purpose, but it is very apt
to stain the- skin. I think I should pre
fer the gallnut wash, which has been used
for many ages by the Moorish women.
Here is the formula: Gallnuts, 12>-> grams;
sulphate of iron, 2Vi grams; water, 7o
grams. Boil the nuts for half an hour.
Strain through fine muslin and add iron.
Boil and reduce two-thirds. Keep well
corked and apply with a small brush,
taking care not to let the liquid touch the
skin or get into the eyes.
HELENE-I do not believe that lano
ltne will induce a growth of hair on the
face more than any oth*r oily substance.
If you like you can increase the amount
of benzoin to ten or fifteen drops. I
would not advise more than the latter
amount. Moles vary so in character that
I always think it is best to consult a phy
.sician 'or a skilled dermatologist before
treating them. However, I think yours
can be removed by the application of a
strong acid. This will form a scab over
the mole, which in a short time will fall
off. taking the mole with it. I would
NEW IDEA FOR A PRETTY COLLARETTE
rather not publish the name of the acid,
as great care is necessary in using it,
but If you Will send mo a stamped ad
dressed* envelope I will tell It to you.
A FRIENDâ Pure lemon juice will re
move the stains from the finger nails. By
"thick flesh under the nail" I .presume you
mean the callous skin that comes from
the use of the file. Friction with a piece
of pumice stone or an emery board will,
In time, remove this.
To soften and whiten the hands, wash
them in oatmeal water. Take some good
oatmeal, boil it in water for an hour,
strain and use the liquid to wash with
night and morning. For an oily, sallow
skin there is nothing better than a good
toilet vinegar. Here is a simple one that
is easily made:
One ounce dried rose leaves: one-half
pfrit white wine vinegar; one-half pint
rosewater. Pour the vinegar on the rose
leaves ar.d let stand for a week. Strain
and add the rosewator. This is also very
good to put on your face before applying
powder. Never use soap on the face just
before using a vir.egar.
MARGARET-If the pores are inclined
to be large, the treatment you refer to
might have a slight tendency to increase
their size, although I have never known
of its having had that effect. \on might
try the following freckle lotion before tr>
ing th.c paste If you have any doubts
about it: ,
Three grains borax, five drams rose
water, five drams orange flowr water.
Great care is always necessary after
using any freckle remover in order to pre
vent a new crop frnm din-eloping. Ine
skin is made more susceptible to wind and
sun nrrl so needs extra protection.
"UONAâ Yes, the fine hairs will return
after pulling tnem out wun prepared
chalk, and the operation will have to be
repeated. They may and they may not
come In thicker than before. There is ab
solutely no sure way of ridding one's face
of superfluous hairs except by the use of
electricity, and even this is not always
successful, for unless the hair bulb is en
tirely killed it will grow again. And In,
the case of fine hairs or fuzz the opera
tion would be too trying and tedious for
even the strongest nerves. Most oils hayÂ©
a tendency to stimulate the growth of
the hairs, olive oil particularly. The cold
cream that I gave recipes for will not
cause the hairs to grow. It is the animal
fats used in the cheaper creams that
bring about that heartrending result.
Witch hazel should not cause th^ pores
to enlarge, and if your skin is particularly
sensitive dilute it one-third. If not. it can
be used pure. Use it only on the nose, un
less the rest of the face is red also. No,
cornstarch is not injurious to the skin.
M. D.â l think there is a thimble-shaped
appliance which is worn on the ends of
the fingers to give them the desired taper,
but I do not know where this can be got,
nor. in fact, if you can find it here. Pinch
ing the ends of the fingers may have thÂ«
desired effect. MME. HYGEIA.
USES OF
INSERTION.
HOTHING sets better upon cloth
than insertion. This comes by the
yard in all colors and costs from
$1 50 per yard upward. It is wide
and a yard goes a gTeat way upon the
dress.
An old cloth dress can be made very at
tractive indeed with Insertion. Now that
it is no longer the fashion to have a plain
skirt, a plain, deep band of the .nsertioil
which rises to a point in the back can be
set around the foot of the skirt and
should it be desired plain little fans of
chiffon or mull can lie set in.
YOUR CHOICE
IN DRESSES.
THIS dress can be made so that It
will cost $SO, or you can get it up
for $8. The materials in case you
want an expensive dress are: Five
yards of the newest impoTtatlon of grena
dine, which comes at $4 50 per yard; two
yards of heavy white satin, which is to
be set under the box plaited border of the
overdress, and a width of Persian silk
for the front of the dress. You will need
as many Inches of Persian silk as the
skirt is long. One width will make tha
vest and front panel. Border the Grecian
squares with silk braid and line the en
tire dress with oil-boiled tart ta.
To get this up for $8 buy: Six yards of
crcpon at 50 cents a yard, forty inches of
shot silk for the front. Instead of silk
braid use baby ribbon around the squares
and in place of heavy white satin under
the squr.res use China silk. The shot silk
is used for a panel and vest instead of
the Persian silk.
In one case the dress is made of grena
dine, Persian silk, white satin and silk
braid and is silk lined.
In the other the same effect is produced
with crepon. shot silk, China silk and ba
by ribbon- and percnline for lining.
NEW STYLES
HAIR DRESSING.
SOCIETY is divided this summer be
tween French and English hair
dressing. French hair dressing is
pompadour. The hair, if not nat
urally curly, is puffed over the forehea*
and around the face, after which it 13
brought up into a big knot on the top of
the head. For evening it is decorated
with narrow ribbon and sprays of silk
perfumed flowers.
The English coiffure, on the other hand,
begins by parting the hair in the middle.
It is puffed on each side of the part and
is draped in such a way as to form a big
knot low in the nape of the neck. This
gives a low forehead and covers the ears
becomingly.
It will be noticed that moat of the new
styles of hair dressing are 30 arranged
as to cover the ears, after the fashion
by Cleo do Merode.

THE ODD FELLOWS.
At the meeting of Cosmopolitan Lodge
on Wednesday night there was work in
the initiatory degree and it was well per
formed. '
Last Tuesday night District Deputy I.
E. Jarrett consolidated the membership
of Myrtle Lodge with that of Occidental
Lodge in the presence of a large number
of people. After the ceremony which
made the two lodges one there was, un
der the direction of Louis Kragen, pre
sented a varied programmme of enter
tainment, which kept the audience, to
gether until it was time to catch the last
car.
One of the most enterprising fraternal
Journals published in this State at this
time is the California Odd Fellow, issued
from the press at Sacramento. It is de
voted to the news of the order, carefully
presented and is not confined to the local
lodges, but to the entire jurisdiction. One
of the publishers is Grand Warden J. L.
Robinet, who is a very active member of
the order, one who is always seeking to
advance its interests not only through his I
paper, but by personal effort.
The banquet that followed the meeting
of the relief committee last Sunday was
a very enjoyable affair. There was an ex
cellent menu and then there were re
sponses to toasts submitted by J. A. Wil
son, the new president of the board, who
acted as chairman. "The Pastâ Looking
Backward," was responded to by L. L.
Remy, the retiring president; "Relief
Boards Outside of San Francisco," Grand
Warden Robinet, who is president of the
Sacramento Board; "Odd Fellows In Odd
Fellowship." John H. Gray; "The Beau
ties of Odd Fellowship," Past President
W. A. Lv Nicholson; "Friendship," Past
President A. J. Doyle; "The Finance Com
mittee," H. H. Dobbins; "The Widows
and Orphans." Vice-President A. G.
Clark; "Things in General," Louis Kra
gon, the retiring treasurer. Then followed
remarks by Dr. Regensburger, his son,
who is noble grand of Bay City Lodge,
Messrs. Weiser, Marchant, Edmonds and
not least. Secretary W. P. Nichols, whose
address was one of the most modest ever
delivered at a gathering of that character.
One of the features of the meeting be
fore the banquet was the presentation by
Dr. Regensburger, the retiring vice-presi
dent, to Louis Kragen, the retiring treas
urer, who after two years' service refused
to serve another term. There were five
parcels, each containing articles that were
more noticeable for their usefulness than
their intrinsic worth. The presentation
address was a most eloquent one. The af
fair, to use the language of the day, took
the recipient "off nis feet," and his re
ply was expressed !n two words.
Loyal Rebekah Lodge will give a Dewey
Social to-morrow night and the ladles who
have charge of the function will present a
fine programme of dances. .

SPAIN IN HISTORY.
By Professor James A. Harrison.
Of all the so-called civilized countries
the history of Spain is the least known to
thi genera] reader. The principal rea.=>>n
his Is the lack of good histories by
the people themselves.
The present war has naturally whetted
the public appetite for historical narra
tives of Spain and the Spanish pp. .pie. If
we except the periods of Spanish history
dealt with by Presctt. Washington Ir
ving and Motley, little If known of the
anr.als of the nation or of the pic
turesque features and great natural re-
Bources of the Iberian Peninsula. One of
the most interesting of works, covering
the whole field of Spanish history, is that
entitled, "Spain in History." Of Spain's
future no writer, of course, can do more
than hazard an opinion, which subsequent
events may or may not justify. The im
mediate prospect Is ominous, with a finan
cially crippled exchequer and a nation of
mutinous and distrustful people, without
a great leader. The gravity of the case
(to quote from the book) obviously coun
sels discretion, but discretion in not a
Spanish virtue, and it ill consorts with
Spanish pride. Did she but heed the
voice of her best friends Spain would
make haste, while there is time, to mend
Hall. The ceremonies were conducted by
J. T. Wild. D.D., assisted by T. W. God
card, P. G., and a degree team from Cali
fornia Lodge. After the ceremony of in
stitution the following officers were in
stalled for the term: Frederick L. Grif
fith, N. G.; Walter H. Jones. V. G.; G. A.
Mauheran, F. S.; Victor C. Turrell. R. S. ;
James W. Murphy, T. ; A. H. Goddard. L.
M.; J. A. Born, physician; W. C. Foster,
S. G. West and J. A. Born, trustees. Aft*Â«
the exemplification of initiation and the
conferring of the first decree there was a
banquet, where there was a good time
and toasts and responses. The principal
speakers were: T. W. Wild, D. D. ; T. \V.
Gnddard, E. Potter. George Filbert, past
grands; F. L. Griffiths. P. G. ; Dr. J. A.
Born, and W. H. Jones, V. G. The ban
quet committee, consisting- of J. W. Mur
phy. W. T. Worthington. H. Plath, S. G.
West and F. L. Griffith, was highly
praised for the splendid spread it pre
pared. The new '.cdpe starts out with a
good charter list, and it will no doubt
meet with all the success that the char
ter members wish for It. A degree team
Is being organized to compete with the
team of Camornla Lodge.
THE NATIVE DAUGhi'ERS.
Orlnda Parlor will give its ninth anni
versary ball on the evening of the 23d
inst. In Native Sons' Hall. The affair
will be strictly invitational, and the com
mittee that hag charge of it promises as
fine a function as was ever given by this
very enterprising parlor.
On the night of the 6th infit., there was
an exemplification of the new ritual be
fore the members <>f Alta Parlor in the
presence of such a large audience that
Shasta Hall, the largest in the Native
Sons' building was not ample enough to
hold all who wished to witness the work.
Those who exemplified the work were
Miss Agnes MeCreery, as president: Mrs.
M. E. Tinman acting as past president: Mrs.
Genevieve Baker as first vice. Mrs. E. An
derson as third vice. Mrs. Lillian Carlie
as second vice, and Miss Lizzie Douglass
as marshal. The work was given in the
most perfect manner, and as an object
lesson, it was one of the most beautiful
that has ever been presented to members
of the order. Among the many visitors
there were members of the order from in
terior parlors and from all of the local
parlors. After the ceremony, the mem
bers of the parlor resolved themselves In
to a committee of the whole and served
refreshments and ice cream to all present.

THE LION OF JANINA.
A wild and whirling dream of Oriental
grorg-eouspcus arid nil venture Is "The Lion
of Jp.nina," but, unlike must such dreams,
It is a little tedious. Pellon is piled upon
Ossa until the brain reels and one stands
dazed before the author's fertility and
recklessness. "And so it chanced that
the sons of All, like the Princes in a fairy
tale, suddenly and marvelously came into
possession of great richer and were wise
enough to profit by these riohee in the
merriest manner in the -world." That is a
characteristic fragment. Jokai deals with
beings presumably real, but they move
In an atmosphere too varicolored for axiy
thir.g but fairyland, ;uid while there are
touches of human nature in the book, we
fear that the oniy way to get pleasure
from it is to abandon one's self to its
barbaric splendors as to a chapter from
the "Arabian Nights." Jokai raises, of
course, the enchantment of that immortal
collection of tales, but he has caught Its
note of Eastern lavlshness.

NATIONAL UNION.
There was a good attendance at the
session of Pacific Council on tho Gth inst.
on the occasion of the official visit of the
San Francisco Cabinet. After a welcome
to the council by President Bunting and
the disposition of routine business there
was an adjournment to the banquet hall,
where there was served a collation and
no liquid refreshments except coffee. Dur
ing the evening the company was enter
tained with a vocal solo by C. Shallon
berger, comic songs and recitations by
Barney Reynolds, from the Chutes; bary
tone solo, C. L. Taylor; address by F.
H. Hastings, president of the cabinet;

was the chairman of the evening; re

ter which M. M. Shonberg favored with
a violin solo and then the entire company
lea, has just been elected a Royal Aca
demician; he had been an Associate for
fioveral years.' .Mr. Harold Frederic says
that this is not altogether pleasing to cer
tain English painters who have been over
looked, and "a certain powerful group or
critics of art and literature" who do not
like Mr. Abbey or his work. But In â pita
of all he has won "Simply because he nas
visibly painted the heads off of all his
competitors for the past throe years.
This certainly shows something more than
fairness, then, on the part of Mr. Abbeys
fellow-Academicians, who elect â â¢! him to
full honors In spite of all opposition. Mr.
Abbey, by the way, continues to live at
Fairford In Gloucestershire â nne of the
prettiest little vlUages in all England. It
Is vary much like Broadway, Worcester
shire; where he made his first English
home and where Mr. Frank Millet, one of
the colon- of American artists in Eng
land, still lives. An artist who delights in
Shakespearean subjects, as Mr. Abbey
docs, can and' his backgrounds on every
street of Fairford; for sixteenth-century
suggestiveness it may be said to rival
Broadway. Indeed, the latter suggests
Morland. or even Birket Foster, more
than it does the golden a,?e- of Elizabeth.
Mr. Abbey has a beautiful home, with
ample grounds and stattl^ 1 trees and a
lawn such as one sees nownere outside of
England. The only modern thing on Mr.
Abbey's place is the studioâ an enormous
building which he and Mr. Sargent share,
and in which they painted their great can
vases for the Boston Public Library.

nounced "several thousand invitation
will be issued, and there- will be a pro
gramme a yard long." it is the inten
tion of the committee to' make this one
of the most attractive high jinks ever
given by a fraternal organization. As
this will be only for the gentlemen of th
guild and their gentlemen friends, ar
rangements will be made for a subst
quent entertainment to be given by th
lady members, and it is possible that, in
view of the fact that they are to be
barred at the high jinks, that they will
get up a Jenny jinks and bar the male
members.
The chapter at Watsonville has within
popular nature, and will present sufficient
information to allow any one to converse
intelligently 'on the subject and avoid the

1 Hiring the last term Center Lodge in
itiated twenty-eight members and in ad
dition initiated eighteen during the past
two weeks. This is the most active work
that has been done ly any lodge in the
jurisdiction and it serves to show that
there is no force in the oft-made assertion
"there are no members to be secured for
the lodges." .
The latest issued statistics of the order
show that at the close of last year there
were more members in the order under
the ag< <>f BO than over that age. The
death rate was less than li! per liXK) of the
nit mbership under fifty. It also appears
that the assessment rates In force more
than paid the death claims of members
who died prior to attaining the age of 50,
that they fully paid those who died be
tween 50 and CO. but that the death cla'ma
of members over 60 amounted to $596,830
more than the members of that class paia
in. The average age of membership was
reduced one and one-half years by the
admission of a large number of new mem
bers under the age of 31.

began to show signs of hostility, so we
made up our minds to mo/c ou- camp
upon what is known as Battle Rock,
a fort that was planned when God
farmed the country. Th^ place show
ed three precipitous sides of solid gran
ite, fifty feet high toward the ocean,
and could only be reached by a natu
ral causeway from land.
"We barricaded the accessible point
as best we could, leaving a porthole
for our bfl'ass field piece â a six pounder.
Necessity compelled us to load it with
Btones, slugs and scraps of iron, and
we filled her to the muzzle. A good
charge was then put into every rirte
in camp, an ' we prepared for the
worst.
"The very next day a body of fully
1000 warriors swept down upon us.
They were the Rogue River, Coquille
and Umpqua tribes who had combined
to drive us from the country.
"They were fully armed with bows
and arrows, and made themselves
more formidable by giving vent to
their hair-raising war whoops.
"Afraid? Well, remember there were
only nine of us against a thousand
braves, and in loading our gun we had
exhausted our supply of ammunition to
two rounds of rifle and pistol charges.
One of our number was a Tennes
eeean who had seen something of fight
ing. We made him our commander. He
was able to persuade the excited men
to reserve their fire until the painted,
whooping fiends were within a few
yards of us, coming on pellmell without
apparent order or discipline.
"When we could see their snaky eyes
gleam through the barricade of brush
wood and small tree trunks the gun
was touched off and th<? deadly hail
of iron and stones sent among them.
We followed this up by giving them
the contents of pistols and rifles. The
unexpected din of firearms as well as
the destructive rain of missiles com
pletely swept away the Indians.
"Many of them in the scramble to
get away fell upon the rocks below and
were dashed to pieces; others plunged
head foremost into the ocean and were
drowned.
"We never stopped to count the dead,
being intent only on getting away. We
made up our minds that there was lit
tle show for nine provisionless, ammu
nitionless men in a country swarming
with hostile Indians.
"We were several weeks In getting
nounced. Mrs. Atherton's "American
Wives " etc., is by far her best work aa
yet and it is said that "The Californi
ans" will not disappoint those who are
interested in her decided progress.
The new biography of Charles Dickens
with which Mr. Thomas Wright of Ol
ney has been busy for several years is
to be published in the autumn. There
may be" room for another life of the nov

competent biographer had undertaken it.

to Portland, as our journey through the
wouds at such a time was necessarily
slow and attended by many hardships.
"With misplaced faith in the wealth
contained in the sand, 1 went back tv
Port Orford after the establishment of
troops at that point, and knew most
of those unfortunate settlers who are
mentioned Li Northern frontier history
as victims of the Rogue River massa
cre of 1856.
"1 talked with Ben Wright, the sub-
Indian agent, a few days before he was
tortured to death by the Chetcos, and
he declared that he was not in the
least afraid of his hostile neighbors.
" Jennie,' said he, alluding to his
squaw, who a day or two afterward
inveigled him to his death, "Jennie
will warn me against any treachery.
The chief of the Wiilamettes has of
,fened fifty ponies for my scalp, but I
guess he'll keep them awhile yet,' and
he laughingly shook the long, curly,
black hair, which he boasted was worn
in that manner to defy the Indians.
The very day that Wright, unknown
to us, was undergoing the death tor
tures, Jennie came into the settlement
and gathered un for removal all their
portable belongings, explaining to me,
when I inquired for Ben, that he had
sent her for their clothing as they
were going to attend a big pow-WOW
given by a peaceful tribe.
"Another Indian victim was old Nor
wegian Dan, whose cabin stood at the
mouth of the river Sixes, and in which
I have had many a smoke and listened
to many a yarn. Dan had sailed sev
eral times around the world, and under
many different flags. In proof of hav
ing figured In several naval engage
ments, he showed sears of cuts innum
erable.
"He well deserved his reputation for
being a unique character, and his ec
centricities were so marked as to be
chronicled in a magazine article of the
period, written by a, young traveler
whom I met the year previous to the In
dian outbreak and the old sailor's
death. One writer related to me his
personal knowledge of Dan with great
amusement. ?'V^*V '
v,Â«'i Th ab L of old Dan contained raw
hide beds but no luxuries, and was in
conceivably dirty. Rut elk steaks were
usually to be had there in abundance
and a brown jug made its appearance
just at the desired moment, so that VhS
cabin at the Sixes was a favorite'stop
pins: place for the male traveler. Â .
V hen the young 1 man and his com
panion rode up and called out for shel
ter, Dan who had retired, shouted back
his usual challenge; to strangers: 'Aro
you Coos Bay people? 1
"Thinking he might have a decided
preference for the inhabitants of that
vicinity the young tenderfoot an
swered cheerfully, 'Yes.' But he learned
his mistake, when with a volley of sea
bred oaths Dan ordered them off the
premises. â¢ ' -
Dan left his cabin at the beginning
of the outbreak and went to the fort
built at the mouth of Rogue Riv^r. in
tending to help the settlers gathered
there.
"With a number of others he was
outside the fort one day, when their
return was cut off by a large band of
Indians.
"Seeing the utter hopelessness of his
position, old Dan rushed into the surf.
Standing waist deep he tired his last
round of ammunition, then hurled hi?
usf-less rifle far out into the sea and
stood with folded arms, defiantly wait

-d was so diffident as to be unfitted to

rriends here and little money and so she
haunted the theaters and tried to per
suade the different managers to let her

would give her an engagement or any en
couragement to hope for one. I believed
in the dowdily dressed Rirl. but could not
help her to an engagement. However,
she kept coming around, and finally tne
ruence which proved to be the foundation
of her fortune came.
"The Wilber Dramatic Company, a 10,
â >0 and 30 cent show, then storming the
country towns, wired me for a leading
lady I sent Miss Arthur at $15 a week.
The next I heard of the girl was when
Wilber walked into my otttce and tnrew
a $20 po!d piece on my desk.
" 'I owe you that and more for sending
me such a jewel,' he said. 'She's the best

"I took a fancy to her, -or she was a
nice little thing, very poorly dressed al-
I ways, and very backward and retiring in
i her ways, probably because o. that, for
; shabby clothes put people at a disadvan-
I tage everywhere, and especially in the
profession. She had a hard time with the
other girls, too. who called her a 'Tar
Flat chippy.' But she did her work faith
fully and well, and I i ade up my
mind that she was fit for something bet
ter than 'extra' work. So when Ned
Harrigan came along under Martin lian
ley's management I asked Ilanlev to per
suade Ned to give her a show. Hanley
did not like the prospect, but gave her a
trial in 'Odella's Aspirations,' Lhcro was
a dance scene, and Miss Lewis made up
as the chippiest kind of a chippy, acting
the part to perfection. She was immense
ly clever about it, and the idea being new
and excellently carried out, it took tre

mu^h so that Harrlgan carried her off
East, and her professional fortune sprang
from that beginning.

will appear in the role in which he played
for over two years continuously. The
odore Roberts, who is a prime favorite
here, is said to be one of the greatest of
Svengalis, who retires Lackaye to the
amateur class. His make-up follows the
idea of the character as drawn by Dv
Maurier. and is one of Intense welrdness.
Mr. Roberts brings to his aid all the re
sources of his art and, it is said, gives
a remarkably clever and impressive pre
sentment of this complex and peculiar
character. It Is promised that the
"Trilby" of the play will be as nearly
ideal as is possible to make it on the
stage. The part is to be played by Misa
Karra Kenwyn, who has been specially
engaged by Mr. Frawley. Miss Kenwyn
is tall and handsome and the mold of her
features will find decided approval in the
picture she will present as the model.
Edward M. Bell will be well cast as the
Laird and John T. Burke should make a
particularly proper Taffy. The impor
tant part or Madame Vlnard will be in
trusted to Eleanor Carey. Others in the
cast will be Louis Payne. Charles Char
ters, Edward G. Conway, Frederick
Tiader, Robert G. Wilson. Carey Livjng
stone. Adora Andrews. Erne Bond, 1- lora
Bristol and the debutante from Sacra
mento, Miss Eva Dennison.
A feature of the Frawley production of
"Trilby" will be the artistic stage set
tings, especially the studio scene, which
will be a veritable corner from Bohemia
In Paris. ______
Jhe TiVoli.
The third week of the successful grand
opera season at the Tivoli will be devoted i
to an artistic production of Richard Wag- '
ner's master creation, "Lohengrin." j
Stage Director George Lask promises all j
the requisites of scenery and costumes to
make the material part of the beautiful .
opera accurate in detail, while the casts ;
of the leading roles guarantee a delight- i
ful interpretation of the harmonic and j
mystic opera.
Two alternating casts will interpret the |
work. Marie Brandis and Anna Lichter j
will alternate as Elsa of Brabant, and on
two occasions Frl. Brandis will sing Or
trad, the designing wife of Telramund;
Mary Linck will be the Ortrud, a part
in which she made one of her greatest
successes ; Sig. Edgardo Zerni and Rhys
Thomas will be the Knights of the Holy
Grail; Sig. Maurice de Vries and William
Pruette as Frederick of Telramund: Sig.
Wanrell and William Schuster as Henry
I, King of Germany. an<l W. H. West as j
the Royal Herald. A fine chorus and aug
mented orchestra will lend valuable aid. j
Ponchielli's romantic grand opera, i^a I
Gloconda," will be sung in the fourth
Week, after which "Rigoletto." "Don trio- '
vannf." "Romeo and Juliet" and "La Bo
heme" will be heard. A novel feature of
this season is the "special Saturday matt
nee for ladles, out-of-town music lovera j
and the younger generation of music
lover*. H Seats are now on sale for the en
tire week.
The /\lcazar.
"Camille," which has been producing fat
box office receipts at the Alcazar during
the week, will be succeeded by a very at
tractive offering of good things beginning
to-morrow night. They will Include
"Faust" on Monday and Tuesday even-
Ings "The Master of Ceremonies on
Wednesday. "Frederick the Gre^f on
Thursday and Friday, and "loricks
Love" on Saturday and Sunday evenings.
The object in producing this quadruple
bill Is to afford those who were unable co
Bee the former performances a last op
portunity to attend. Each will be given
the same careful production wnich
marked the former presentation. Next
week Mr. Morrison will put on "The Mer
chant of Venice" and make his debut as
Shylock. In elaboration and perfection
of detail it is to be an "Irving produc
tion." This is expected to be the banner

is now fast drawing to a close.
J^lorosco's.
At Morosco's Grand Opera-house
"Work and "Wages" will be the attraction
for the coming week. It is a five act i
melodrama of the sturdy old style, some- '
what on thÂ» lines of "The Lost Paradise." I
The scenes are laid in England in and i
around a modern steel works, and in- ;
elude a vivid reproduction of the interior !
of the factory with machinery in opera- j
tion. an explosion, etc. The fourth act j
shows the tenements of the slums of !
London, the poverty and wretchedness j
thereof, and finally the murder of a j
woman, of which the hero is accused.
There Is a concentration of the tragic m
the last act. It is a courtroom scene.
The murderer Is convicted and he gives
a sensational finish to the action by com
mitting suicide in the prisoner's dock be
fore the Judge can sentence him to hang.
The motive of the play is to show tha |
possibilities and benefits of co-operation i
between employer and employe, and the I
production is said to be highly engross
ing. The leading character will be played
by Max yon Mitzell, who has recently j
joined the stock company. This will be i
the la-3t appearance this season of Maude
Edna Hall, who goes East. Lorena At- \
wood, a promising young artiste, will havr; â 
a prominent role. H. G. Hockey, the
clever character comedian of the Hockey-
Whc-eler Company, has been specially en
gna^d, as has also the dainty soubretto,
Marlon Hockey. E. J. Holden. H. J". Ed
wards, James Corrlgan and Nellie Camp

ditions to the regular stock company,

for in his support will appear Arthur El
liott, Augustus Cook. Charles B. Welles,
C. Leslie Allen, Earl Browne, George
Heath, Harry Spear. Jamea A. Leahy,
Leo Lane. Mabel Bert. Margaret Dale,
Laura Clement and Ellen Mortimer. The
plays to be presented are all new here.
The first week will be devoted to
"Heartsease," a pretty romantic comedy
from the pens of Charles Klein and J. I.
C. Clarke. Its run of over one hundred
nights at the Garden Theater, New York,
was one long series of crowded houses,
and the new star followed it last year
with the bill for his second week, ''The
Master." and his inaugural triumph, it is
said, was more than duplicated. "A Mar
riage of Convenience" is to be the bill for
the third week of the season.
The reopening will occur on the 22d lnst.
At the close of Mr. Miller's season Mme.
Modjeska will appear In a series of her
best productions.
JievJ Gomcdvj Jheater.
Manager M. B. Leavitt announces for
the opening of his New Comedy Theater
(formerly the Bush) Mrs. Romualdo Pa
checo's Ideal Comedy Company. This
well-known authoress and playwright will
present for the first time on any stage
her new and original comedies by an ex
cellent company. The company consists
of several well-known players, and will
come direct to this city, opening on the
evening of September 3. The work of
Mrs. Romualdo Pacheco as a playwright
will be remembered by her first presenta
tion in this city of her amusing comedy,
"Incog," which met with great success
at this theater some five years ago. Mrs.
Pacheco's plays will be presented with
new scenery and effects. The one selected
to open the new house is, "The Leading
Man." Following this will be seen "Amer
ican Assurance," "Woman's Wit" and
"SIO,OOO Reward."
The New Comedy Theater is now under
going thorough renovation and several
new features will be introduced that will
be a comfort to Its patrons. The interior
will be in rich ivory and gold, with new
scenery, drop curtain,* draperies, carpet
ing and a most novel electrioai display.
GKutes and Zoo.
The Chutes free theater is looming up
In amusement circles, and the uniformly
good entertainments always provided at
the Haight-street grounds serve to at
tract large crowds. Next week Edwin R.
Lang, the "poetical tramp," will make
his first appearance in San Francisco. He
is an accepted favorite at Tony Pastor's
In New York thirty weeks in the year,
and his talk and songs should be interest
ing. El Nino Eddy does a bounding wire
act said to be out of the ordinary and Bell
and Dalton, German knockabout come
dians, will indulge in Teutonic acrobatic
eccentricities. Douglass and Ford are as
clever exponents of the modern song and
dance as have been seen here in many
a year, and Mr. Douglass will do new
toe steps, while Miss Ford pirouettes.
Diefc Mack, who has made a hit. will
change his and songs, and Ma
son and Reed, the comedy horizontal bar
performers, will repeat their act. "The
Tramp and the Section Boss." Twelve
new moving pictures, direct from Europe,
will be shown, and the London Fire De
partment in active operation will be re
tained. In the Zoo, Sultana and her three
baby lions are demanding great attention,
although a huge alligator from Tampa
threatens to monopolize the interest.
Henri Maurice Cannon, the lionized fat
man, receives visitors every afternoon
and evening.
Jhe Olympia.
The Olympla Music Hall has a partic
ularly meritorious attraction in the Royal
Tokio acrobatic wonders, who are cred
ited with doing some of the most clever
balancing, juggling and acrobatic feats
ever performed by a Japanese troupe.
Other features of the bill are Darrell and
Miller in songs, dances and witty dia
logue: Maud Rockwell in new patriotic
songs; the Royce sisters, a dancing duo
of pretty girls; Anita Laraont in coon spe
cialties and others. Matinee to-day.
People ar\d J^la^s.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 13.â The animation of to- '
Cay's stock market was far less than that of i
last Saturday and the net gains on the day's
transactions were much less striking. The ac- \
tual signing of the peace protocol brought no |
enthusiastic buying, but on tne other hand It '
brought no realizing sales, such as are like'.y
to occur on the culmination of an event herald- j
ed and discounted. There was a large and
eteady demand throughout the short session of ;
the Exchange, which held prices quit- firmly
throughout the list. Active buying in a few
stocks was conspicuous, especially Northern !
Pacific, which added another point to its price
In the course of the day. The grangers were
strong and Union Pacific showed an advancing :
tendency. The Southern railroads continued |
somewhat depressed, owing to the yellow fever j
case reported at a town in Louisiana. The mo- !
tive of the recent selling of Manhattan was
disclosed by the report for the quarter showing
a falling off In gross earnings compared with
last year of $145,927. The stock was lifted after
early depression by the demand to cover. Very
notable advances were shown by the rubber 1
stocks. Tobacco and New York Air-Brake.
There was no evidence of heavy liquidation for
London account as a result of the Anglo-Rus-
Eian crisis, and those who sold short yesterday,
professing fears of such a result, bought to
cover to-day. The large decrease of $6,751,150
In the surplus reserves of the banks was with
out effect. Th closing was generally firm, only
a few stocks showing slight recessions from
the best. The dealings in stocks this week rose
fully a million shares over those of last week,
but are still almost a million shares below the
corresponding week last year. The par value
of the bonds sold at the Exchange during the
â week was, however, fully equal to that of last
year, and exceeds 521,000,000. Business was ex
tremely varied In character and embraced so
extensive a list of securities that the movement
of special stocks was of little effect In deciding
the course of prices. Weakness at some points
was without influence at others. Where the
demand seemed to continue unabated there was
obviously realizing- going on, but apparently
the profit from sales was diverted to other
stocks of lower grade which had not yet moved
â upwards. The demand for stocks is" undoubt
edly based on general conditions, and the mar
ket has been little affected by the epecial news
developments of each day.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. 13.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The market
to-day was stagnant and dull, the only feature
being a small recovery in Grand Trunks on
belief thai the small carry-forward is perhaps
due to the large amount set aside for rolling
stock. Americans were on about a parity with
New York quotations There is a surprise here
that American exchange is firmer following
t'-e New York spurt In money mtes. The mar
ket finds it moat difficult to form any estimate

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, Aug. 13.â New York Finan
cier says this week: The statement of the
Associated Bank* of the city of New York
for the week ending August 13 shows that the
deposits and loans have reached a higher to
tal than has been previously reported by these
banks. The chief features of the statement are
the loss In cash and the continued expansion
of loans, which have marked the operations of
the banks for a considerable period. Deposits,
however, are gaining at a much less rapid
ratio, and reserves are decreasing-. A hard
ening condition of money rates is to be ex
pected with these conditions remaining In
rcrce and. indeed, this result has already been
observable in the past week. A forecast of the
money market at this time Is peculiarly dif
ficult, but the banks have been able to con
siderably improve their position as leaders by
their operations of the past month or so.
The large cash resources of the West make It
unusually problematical to estimate their de
mands on the New York banks, but on the
other hand there Is every evidence of larger
crops than were anticipated some time ago.
Business Is becoming more active and the
demand may be heavier than has been looked
for The large debt still owing by Europe
cannot be discarded from the reckoning and
it has yet to be proved how badly Europe needs
this money.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. 13â Liverpool quotations, In
stead of showing any sympathy with yester
[ day's higher prices on this side, were a little
lower than the Litest en the day before. That
i gave the direction to speculation sentiment here
.â it the start. First trades in September wheat
j were at 66% c down to G6%c against 67H'5'<Â»7Vic I
| lost night's closing figure. The weather for
' matvrlng what was still unharvpsted of the
; spring wheat crop was all that could be desired,
and reports from the Northwest were far from
' encouraging to the longs In the market. A dis
patch from up North said It was confidently ex
pected Minneapolis and Duluth would be, In
j about two weeks, receiving an average of 400
cars a. day. In addition to that, about one
! hour after the opening Minneapolis reported 7c
j a bushel drop in the price of cash wheat to ar
' rive. Such Information and foreshadowings of
the future drove from the minds of the traders
all concern about the day's actual receipts,
which were as conspicuously short of last
! year's movements as they have been for some
j time. The market wok kept from getting radi
cally weak for a time by estimates that Chi
cago would only have I'iO cars of wheat Mon
day, but that gave way again to the impending
free movement of spring wheat and the market
wound up very heavy September closed iHc
lower ar.d December loet lc.
Corn was steady lor September. December
was sold with considerable freedom, and got to
a cent discount until near the end. The
weather was as favorable as could be desired
for the recuperation of the eick portion of tne
i crop. September closed unchanged from yester
day and Decemb'T is ',4c lower.
Shippers were the only buyers to speak of In
: ontp, and that grain merely followed the flue
; tuatlons of corn September closed le lower
ttinn yesterday's close.
The yellow fever scare that shook out the
weak members of the provision crowd yester
day was to-day pronounced a matter of no ac-
I count oxcept for such purpose as It had ac
! compliehed. Buying by bmkera acting for
: packing houses quickly absorbed the off-rinors.
and prices took an upward turn near the close.

scribers, is given as the equivalent of
$30 per annum within 1000 yards of the
exchange, running up by stens as -the
distance increases. An interesting fact is
that the switchboard operators receive a
salary (?) of from $6 to $12 per.month,
â working seven to eight hours per day.
Linemen receive from 40 to 60 cents
per day for ten hours' work.', extra time
being paid for at the rate of 4 cents per
hour. * ' " â  ; â  '' â  '

â â <â 'â¢ [Synopsis of preceding chapters. Blnnle and

.' troop of Cuban patriots, to rescue the Senorlta
"! Julia, who has been carried away as a iris

i â 'becomo a traitor, and who is now acting as a
"â  Spanish spy. has betrayed to the Spanish that
felr.nie and Ned and their followers are com
â â 'â Vag, and the Spaniards have sawed the timbers
â¢ ' : of a bridge over a deep canyon that Cubans
'. and Binnle and Nad may be trapped into rid-
I; ing upon the bridge, which still stands, but
. which was supposed not to be strong enough
: to hold their combined weight ]
CHAPTER IV.
WHILE Julia awaited the com
ing- of Binnie and Ned and
their Cuban followers her
heart was heavy. She tried
to escape that she might give
them warning and turn them back be
' tore It was too late. She reached the
"edge of the dense growth of treea and
bushes that bordered upon the trail
â¢akmg which she had been brought as a
; "prisoner by the Spaniards. A pistol
â  -click caused her to look around. Be
fore her stood the Spanish captain.
: "So," he said sneeringly, "my fair
:. young Cuban girl would leave us. Here,
â guard, tie this young lady tight and
fast; for she might get away. Do not
forget to put a gag in her mouth, for
she might be able to call aloud at a
time when we might prefer silence. She
: has tried to escape and hereafter she
â¢ will be treated like any other prisoner."
â â "â â ' Some hours passed, during which
Julia saw and heard all that took place,
'.but she was helpless. A sentinel, who
: had been stationed in a tree overhang-
Ing the trail, some distance from the
camp, gave the signalâ 'The Americans
.axe coming."
Every Spaniard looked to his rifle
and pistols. The snapshooting of
Binnie had already inspired wholesome
â  respect for his prowess. On came the
Americans and their followers at an
easy canter. They saw the enemy and
â  halted for counsel. Seeing this and
afraid that his plans might fail after
all, the Spanish captain schemed quick
jy. A certain Spanish soldier had a
.voice like a woman's. Him the captain
called for instruction.
"Help, oil, nelp mo or It will Lre too
â . late."
These were the words that Binnie and
â¢Ned heard. Not uuubting that they
were spoken by Julia in appeal to them,
: .and fearing lest she might be under
going some form of torture at the
hands of the Spaniards to force her to
.give up Cuban secrets, Binnie gave the
'.. command in a ringing tone, "Forward."
Forward it was. Along tiie dusty
trail and onward to the bridge swept
the friends of the imprisoned girl, with
pistols in hand, ready to die for her if
..need be. At the head of the array was
. Binnie, spurring on his horse with all
the impatience of youth. The Span
iards, only a few of whom were per
â  "mined to be seen, awaited the fall of
. the' bridge as the hoofs of the American
-and Cuban horses struck sharply upon
â¢â¢the planking at the farther end.
.'Through the thick foliage of the way
: side gleamed the wolfish eyes of Rami
rez, the spy, as he watched his former
:?:comrades conning on to certain death.
: ''But he gave no warning sound.
â¢ How was this? The Americans and
:â¢ /Cubans are already more than half way
â  : - : acr6ss the bridge and the structure
does not fall! They are seen to be
â  stronger in numbers than the Span
. -lards. "Dolts," hissed the Spanish cap
.tain, "the bridge does not even jar.
; One- minute and we shall be beaten.
PUZZLEâ FIND THE HOSTLER.
. Ho there, guard, charge!"
; So the Spaniards, one and all, all ex
cept Ramirez, rode recklessly forward
to mee.t their foes, firing as they rode.
.What the issue of that day would have
..â¢been if the forces had met in battle
can never be known. The combined
"weight of the Spaniards and their ene
mies made the bridge break.
; - The structure shook like a man with
â¢ the ague; then there was a loud and
.fearful crash and the timbers that had
been' cut partiy through dropped down
into- the abyss that yawned below. Men
ajid frightened horses, arms and a<
cbuterments went down with the wreck,
\vith the sound of shouts of alarm in
â the air and the final cracking of Span
ish and Cuban rifles, for the Cubans
had opened fire as soon as they saw
their enemies advancing. The bed of
â¢the mountain stream that brawled
through the deep canyon two hundred
feet below the trail was strewn with
sharp, jagged rocks. These received
. .many victims. To the edge of the can
.. yon, peering over, crept Ramirez, the
\ "fcpys Of all the men who not long be-
Vfore had been so full of life, not one,
\wlth the exception of the Spanish cap
tain, was seen by Ramirez to move,
yroaningr and bleeding the captain rose
Ind tried to climb up the steep side
I the canyon. The spy watched him
curiously from above, his wicked eyes
sparkling with a baleful light. No
sign betrayed his presence to the cap
tain; no hand was stretched forth to
help him, although it was evident to
the spy that the captain was badly
hurt. Slyly, like some loathsome beast
of prey, the sny now began to descend
the trail to the bottom of the canyon,
a path which few knew. Half way up
the dizzy wall of the canyon the cap
tain was clinging to a projecting bush,
which was stained with his blood; there
he was striving to rest that he might
go on upward. Before him, face to
face, suddenly stood Ramirez.
Anger flashed into the captain's face.
"Dog," he cried, "why have you not
come to my heln; and why, when you
saw my toil, did you not assist me to
find the trail?"
"I came down to say, captain," re
marked the villain, coolly, "that you
and I are the only survivors of this
day's foolish work."
"Foolish! How do you dare to In
sult a Spanish officer? Dog, begone! I
will see that you meet with your de
serts!"
"No more, no more," the words came
sternly from the spy. "No one shall
call Ramirez a dog!"
Th*Te was a flash, a Bharp cry and
the captain lost his hold and with a
pitiful cry fell back into the canyon,
dead.
The spy replaced his smoking revol
ver in his belt and rapidly retraced his
steps and reached the top of the can
yon once more. The idea came to him
on his upward path that some one
might have seen his act. He leaned
over the side of the canyon and
watched intently, with his pistol in his
ready hand. Woe to any one who then
manifested life in the depth of the can
yon Spaniard, American or Cuban
would have fared alike.' The only
thoueht of the spy was to destroy any
witness who might yet arise to tell of
his awful crime. All the troopers were
seemingly dead. In truth they were all
dead with the exception of the two
American boys and they were uncon
scious of all that was happening.
â¢ It is well," at last said the spy, turn
ing away. "I did not mean to kill the
captain; only to bargain with him that
I should have all the reward for the
capture of the Senorita Julia. I thought
that I had the captain then in a place
where he would not haggle about the
terms â but he would quarrel with me.
Ah, well, it cannot be helped now. I
will now take possession of Julia. With
her as a prisoner and with my knowl
edge of the secrets of the Cubans I will
yet be a exeat man. First to see that
the pirl does not escape me."
Ramirez ' reached the abandoned
Spanish camp, expecting to find Julia
there. He could hardly believe his eyes
-when he saw that she was not. Where
was she? Had she witnessed the kill
ing of the Spanish captain? Of all per
sons on earth she was the most dan
gerous to his existence at this time.
She knew of his treachery to the cause
of Cuba. He had sat quietly by, giv
ing no warning when his countrymen
had rushed forward to their doom. He
was a double traitor â and she knew it.
His first thought was to seek her. His
second was that she might even now,
enraged by his acts, be in ambush,
ready to shoot him down- He mounted
the fleetest horse and turned to flee.
He must put miles between himself
and the girl before she could arouse
the whole countryside to hunt him. He
had given no mercy and well he knew
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGL^ST 14, 1898,
that he need not expect any mercy at
the hands of the Cubans when they
learned the truth about him. He
thought no more of his personal ad
vantage; safety was his first and only
aim now.
When he had departed, forth crept
Julia from her place of concealment.
There she had seen all that had taken
place. She made her way easily down
to the bottom of the canyon, taking the
most dangerous but quickest way.
There might remain life In some of the
unfortunate men. She had no thought
of her own danger; her duty was to
reach the wounded as soon as possible.
Tears flowed down her cheeks and
stifling sobs shook her frame as she
found her dead friends. But she went
resolutely forward, feeling for a flut
tering pulse; listening for the feeble
beat of a heart; smoothing tenderly
the hair from the foreheads of dead
Cuban patriots; sobbing as she found
them â father, brother, cousin, friends â
all deadâ all except Binnie and Xed.
She at first thought that the two Amer
icans were dead. Upon the lip? of each
of the devoted band of patriots she
placed a kiss of farewell.
"Holy martyrs to the deathless cause
of freedom," she said, "God's love and
â TJJg 2\JMPXIft& LANDLADY;. AHDXJ&yEO;B YA } x /WNX2:f(
peace is yours."
Seized by a sudden impulse she,
standing erect, surrounded by her dead
countrymen, took up a machete which
had fallen from a trusty Cuban hand
and held it aloft toward heaven.
Above the hush of the forest, marred
only by the sound of a brawling moun
tain stream, rose the voice of the hero
ine, thrilling with Its pathos as she ut
tered the magic words, "Cuba Libre."
She seemed like the spirit incarnate
of liberty. Her eyes*, filled with tears,
still glowed with enthusiasm for her
native land. She once more resolved
to consecrate all her life to Cuba's
cause. On the blade of the machete
was a stain â the stain of a brother who
fell in an early battle for freedom. The
sunlight, shining upon the wreck of all
about her, kissed the hair of the hero
ine and rested lovingly upon hor.
Through the aisles of the forest sped
the sound of her voice; and Ramirez,
the spy, traitor to his native land, and
traitor to the friends and playmates of
his childhood, heard an echo that
seemed to chase him like an avenging
spirit:
"Cuba libre. Cuba libre."
Hardened as he was. wicked as he
was, a chill crept over his heart.

easy for you."
Louis bent over again and put his
thirsty lips to the spout. This time his
tormentor moved the pump handle
about as fast as the hour hand of a
â¢watch and about three drops trickled
out.
"Pump, will you?" cried Louis.
"Oh, yes," roared the other, and Louis
was sputtering in a rush of the water,
while the boys exploded with laughter.
Louis sprang at Martin, shaking his
wet head like a Newfoundland dog, and
grappled with him fiercely. But after
all It was only a friendly tussle; the
bell rang, and they all went back to
the schoolroom as good friends as ever.
But Martin's back-strap gave way in
the scuffle, his books tumbled out on
the ground, and a closely written sheet
of paper went across the school's ten
nis court through the iron fence
"Put up your books, boys," said the
teacher. "I shall let you decide who
shall get the English prize. I gave
Martin and Louis each a composition
to write and I'm going to read them
and let the class award the prize."
Louis got his paper out and stood
ready to marcl. up with Martin.
But where was Martin's paper? He
â¢was sure it was In his algebra. No;
well, In his history; and so he went
through every book.
"Well, well, where are the papers?"
demanded the teacher.
"I have lost mine," said Martin.
"Then there will be less trouble.
Louis, where Is yours?"
There was silence in the schoolroom.
Louis turned red, then pale. Then he
quietly tore his paper across the mid
dle and said in a respectful tone:
"I have none to hand in, sir."
Instantly the class broke into Irre
pressible applause.
"Silence!" thundered the teacher.
Then, in a tone of voice they had
never heard him use before, he said:
"Boys, I would rather have seen a
generous thing like that among you
than to have a prince of the royal blood
in my achool. That Is what I call lov
ing your neighbor as yourself and you
all know who gave us that command
and set us the great example."

THE PIANO
BEWITCHED
ELVIRA certainly tried to do her
best to learn her music lessons.
Everyday for an hour and often
times more she would practice
her five-finger exercises and
plunge into her scales in a reck
less manner that was unfailingly sure
to end in a hopeless confusion and tan
gle of fingers, pursed lips, scowling
brov: and temper not exactly angelic.
Her music teacher. Miss Rose Wallac?,
Bald that she thought Elvira had talent
but that she lacked concentration. El
vira didn't exactly understand what
"concentration" meant, but she did
know one thing and that was that she
couldn't be victor in a scrimmage with
her lessons every day, and that so far
she had made a failure.
Helen Arthur, who lived across the
street in a flat, was a fine player, and
played at concerts. And Elvira used to
feel in a humor that urged her to kick
her naughty little heels together when
she heard the praises that pepie be
stowed upon the fortunate Helen.
So she set herself bravely to work,
but to no avail. One day it was h<>t
and oppressive and Elvira felt indo
lent and unambitious. She had prac
ticed her Czerny over at least ten
times until she could have played the
thing by memory with her eyes shut.
The windows were open to cool the
room and the summer breezes blew
gently in over her hot brow and sh'^
closed her eyes in a semi-drowsy
state. No one was in the house but
her mother and herself, and her moth
er was fast asleep upstairs.
She settled herself comfortably down
on the pofa in the spacious room and
suddenly some one struck the piano.
She opened her eyes. No one waa in
the parlor but herself, andâ the piano
played some elegant chords all by it
self. For some strange reason Elvira
felt no especial inclination to get up
and see what this meant, and so she
just opened her eyes and watched. Her
hearing was very acute, and she
thought she must be dreaming. But,
no, she wasn't.
The piano was beginning: to play the
prelude to "The Mermaids' Valse" â
that hateful old prelude which she
couldn't understand and in which she
found herself so often mixed. She had
thought ft the homeliest thing in the
musical line that she had ever heard
âbut now she thought it was very
pretty. Then a strange transformation
took place. Looking down at the floor
she saw she was no longer on a Brus
sels carpet with circular patterns on
it, but that the waves rolled ov^r the
floor in a soft, purling fashion, and
that her couch was no longer a sofa
chair, but a boat. She closed her eyes
in bliss as she heard the rippling mu
sic of the piano pouring out of it cease
lessly. She opened her eyes again.
Her boat was slowly rocking forward
over the waters past what had once
been a center table, but was now a rock.
On it sat three mermaids, combing
their long yellow locks and gazing at
themselves in ivory mirrors, mean
while singing â or was it the piano? â
the air of "The Mermaids' Valse?"
Then they faded from view, and she
v.as sitting in a theater all by herself.
All was dark around her, but before was
a lurge stage, brilliantly illumined and
gayly festooned. Rubbing her dazed
eyes she saw â oh! what was that â a
dainty little creature, much like a stray
rose leaf, bound on to the stage as the
piano was playing the beautiful strains
of Leo Delibes' "Pizzicati." Calcium
lights from above threw on her little
form all the colors of the rainbow, and
her beautiful white, gauzy garments
rose and fell like the wings of some
great tropical butterfly and wound
themselves into flamelike folds. So
graceful and startlingly beautiful!
Such flashing blue eyes; such mist of
golden hair like the spun sunbeams
flying around her like a stray web!
Then the scene changed. Elvira was out
in the forest under the sweet smelling
pines and deep shadowing oaks. The
moon was high and the stars were
briglit, but here there was a sense of
mystery.
The piano was playing Mendelssohn's
"Midsummer Night's Dream." Fairy
forms flltteS here and there, clad in
silvery eerie webs. Elfish faces peered
at her from beneath the shrubbery,
and bats darted everywhere. Not far
distant, away in wild glee, danced the
fairies in a magic ring, and their sil
very echoing song broke the stillness of
the midnight air. Then they all arose
and circled about her. Then the tune
changed and the scene v. -.ished.
She was in Scotland now. Dumnty
dumpty-dumpty-dumpty. The stac
cato notes of the Highland fling came
shrilly to her ear and she looked
about to find where they came
from. The piano she still heard.
There was no other music, but it surely
sounded like a bagpipe. A tfroup of a
dozen or so of merry Highlanders, pic
turesque in their sturdy grace and pc
culiar costumes, were spending their
leisure hours in indulging in favorite
pastime. Then the scene, like that on
the kinetoscope, was taken from her.
She was in the parlor again, yet it
seemed as if she had not been outside
of the room, for she had been sitting
there all the while.
It had then been early morning; it
was now darkest night. Through the
room from the piano came the weira
strains of the Witches' Dance, as a
half-dozen witches flew in through tne
window astride broomsticks. The moon
was half hidden behind the clouds and
the wind blew rather loudly. The rose
bush outside the window rattled ana
swayed. Then they built a fire right in
the middle of the floor, but it did not
burn the carpet. They fetched in great
logs and built the fire high until it
roared and crackled, and still the piano
played. What oddly beautiful music,
yet it seemed distorted with avarice
and secret plotting. It crashed and
hummed and sighed, and they gnashed
their teeth and danced peculiarly and
hopped and jumped about the fire.
Then they put in queer-smelling herbs
and the whole room was filled with
blue smoke. And th^n they disap
peared. "
Now she was in Norway, yet she did
not move from her chair. It was a win
ter day and the snow fell thick and
fast. Outside all was white and cold;
inside the fire roared with satisfaction.
A Scandanavian mother was rock
ing her little girl to sleep. Such
a fat, rosy, good-natured little flaxen
haired baby, with big, blue eyes. It
had on a thick blue wool coat and a
little white cap. which it wore almost
all the time. Its mother had it hugged
up close in her great, strong arms, and
its little head lay comfortably on her
shoulder. It was going to sleep, for
the piano was playing McDowell s
"Slumber Pong"â that most lovely of
all cradle songsâ and Elvira was fas
cinated with its deep and mellow melo
dies so newly changing and express
ively beautiful. She heard the mother
singing â
Frozen is the ground, the stream's ice
bound, fc..
Softly the north wind croons, softly
croons;
Drowsily, sleepily falls the snow,
As thf ' north wind carves his runes,
carves his runes.
But the piano does it all; it did it
all then, and the scene faded out of
sight.
She was back in her own country
now. It was in New York, for she heard
the organ grinder playing "Down in
Front of Casey's." Her room was so
bare and small. The piano was playing
"The Sidewalks of New York," but she
couldn't see it anywhere. She was liv
ing in a tenement house. Her small
room had no carpet on the floor, and
there was only one window to it, and
that opened on Mrs. O'Rourke's
shanty, in the back, where the clothes
were hung out. She looked out the
door. The ragged little urchins and
the tattered girls were dancing and
singing. It was just dusk, and it was
Sunday. Those little folks never knew
what thP inside of a church looked
like. There was the old brown wooden
stoop, too. Then the scene disappeared.
She was in Arabian lands.
She was sitting by herwindow looking
down over the gardens. The plash of
the waterfalls and the ripple of the
water came plainly to her enraptured
ears. The sweet scent of tropical flow
ers greeted her nostrils. The great
Southern moon hung low over the hor
izon, mellowing the landscape into
gold. Below her she heard the pas
sionate pleadings of the piano as it
burst into the Bedouin Love Song.
Such implorings, such wildness! "From
the desert I come to thee." Arabian
fire surged through the song. And
then it djed away â no, It was a differ
ent scene, now. â¢
It was a German scene. She was in
a great cathedral filled with beautiful
angels, clad in white robes so dazzling
that Elvira could scarcely look at
them. Such grandeur in their faces,
such gladness and unquenched joy!
What was that they were singing?
Ah! It was the Hallelujah Chorus.
Eivira felt her pulses quicken and her
heart-blood stir. Then the song was
ended. The vision faded, and the
church, grand Li its ancient glory, dis
appeared.
The piano played onâ something so
sweetly sad and solemn that Gertrude
could have bowed in prayer. The wax
tapers on the great altar in the dis
tance gleamed and flickered. And then
/* F i *-? fINC? PARTY OR THREE
it slowly disappeared from view.
Now she was In Poland amid the
mountains. The piano, somewhere by,
was playing with its deep richness
that beautiful piece so full of smoth
ered earnestness â Rubinstein's Ro
mance. Then she was instantly trans
ported to Japa.i. Three young girls in
the curious fashion and garb of that
country â the piano was playing,
"Three little maids from school," from
"Mikado." A big bowl of ri.e was in
the middle of the floor, which was cov
ered with matting.
Then she was back in America â in
dear old 'Frisco. Clear and loud she
heard the shrill piping of the piccolo,
PUZZLEâ FIND THE SPANISH SHARPSHOOTER.
"The girl I left behind me." She saw
the transports leave and thenâ it seem
ed as if a thousand pianos, all in differ
ent tune and time, banged away and
then came a erash â :
Elvira awoke! No, it couldn't
have been a dream, she thought! The
piano was standing just as she left it â
and she still works hard at her five
finger exercises. Estette Baker.
TWILIGHT FANCIES.
BY CHARLES ELMER UPTON,
PLACERViLLE.
The day is o'er, the cricket's trill
Sounds cheerily without,
But silent is my hearth, and chill â
No forma are roundabout.
Yet not alone am I to-night.
For shapes unseen are here:
Upborne by airy pinions light,
They drift from everywhere.
Dear phantoms of my childish friends.
Dim emblems of a love
That to mine earthly spirit lends
A halo from above!
I see no more the lonely hearth,
Nor moan my cheerless lot;
Encompassed by the children's mirth,
My sorrows are forgot.
Forgotten are the cares of life,
And man's inhuman wiles.
For naught may be of sin or strifa
Where holy childhood smiles.
So. as the ev'ning shadows fall,
I sit in calm content.
Grateful to the King of all
Who hath such blessings sent.
And what if brainless men deride
My life upon the hill?
I spurn them all. for at my side
The children linger still!
THE YOUNG HERO'S FLAG.
THE following story about a patri
otic little boy who lives in San
Francisco was sent in by M. S. D. :
Walter B. lives in the Western
Addition. He is a loyal little fel
low and takes great interest in the sol
diers. He loves to go to the park and
see them drill, and down to the wharf
to see them embark on the transports.
Nearly everyday he wishes his flags
to wave from the window, but, best of
all, he loves to go up on the hill to see
the great ships go sailing out of the
Golden Gate, bound for the far Philip
pines, and wave a parting salute to the
brave boys who have given up all for
their country. A few days since he
went with his mamma to see the Mon
tana and South Dakota companies start.
They each took a flag, and Walter* was
a beautiful silk one.
On came the soldiers, tramp, tramp,
tramp. As they passed a soldier cried
out, "Lady, please give me your fl-g."
Of course she gave It. Directly another
cried: "Little boy, do please give me
your flag. Oh, do, do, please give me
your flag." Walter hesitated for one
moment and then the beloved flag was
held out to the soldier, tout the fountain
of tears came near overflowing, and it
was a very sad little boy that reached
home, saying, "I did want my flag; I
did want my flag."
Was not that an act of self-renuncia
tion for a little six-year-old?
We trust that soldier will count that
flag among his treasures.
INDIAN TALE
OF AMOS QUITO.
By M. W. L.
DID you ever hear the true story,
according to the Indians, of Amos
Quito? Many years ago, so the
story goes, the Indians of the
Middle Atlantic coast were ter
rorized and suffering under the donre
dations of two monsters. The TuscarcM
ras suffered most. These two monsters
were as powerful as sods, but as wick
ed as demons, and they stood, one on
each side of the Seneca River, and slevf
all that passed.
But relief came. The gTeat Hiawatha;
rose up and killed one of the creatures,
but the other, huge in stature and swift
of wing-, escaped. He was the father
of all the small tribe that exist to-day,
and his name was Mosquito!
Having: lost his favorite pastime ha
raged along the shores of Long Island
and New Jersey, and up into New York
and down into Pennsylvania, but hi 9
home, remember, the home of this great
mosquito, was at Fort Onondaga, New
York; and make it a point, you, to let
the New Yorker know his claim to dis
tinction in this matter.
To give you an idea of the ravages
of this monster, it is reported that at
one swoop, uttering a shrill cry, of
which the Siren whistle is believed to
be a modification, he would seize two
of the biggest savage braves and eat
them, and then use their ribs for tooth-Â«
picks.
So the people suffered. There was but
one great and awful mosquito, but hia
bite meant complete annihilation, and
while his victims were few, very few,
compared to those of his offspring,
their fate was infinitely worse.
Moreover, this great father of BtlngÂ»
was invulnerable; the IntÂ»inas had no
weapon that would not turn aside from)
him; they were helpless; whereas, tha
mosquito" of to-day can individually ba
killed, but take him collectively, and wa
are in as much need of a deliverer aa
were the ancient redskins, to whom
help came in this fashion:
The Holder of the Heavens heard 1
their despairing cries, and came down,
prepared to fight the insect to tha
death. But Mosquito was swift of wingr,
and when he found that he had met hia
match he turned and flew away. It waa
a chase that shook nature itself. Tha
sun was hot; dull clouds of mist hung
over the earth, and night brought no
hellef.
Finally the two powers met, ancT
Mosquito was slain, out upon the sandy
shores of Lake Onondaga, where he had
reigned supreme. In his death strupr
jiles he kicked up great sand hills,
which are there even now, as proofs
that this is a true story. But as hi 3
blood spread out upon the land each,
drop turned into a thousand small mos
quitoes; and that is the true history of
the origin of the insects that now ara
found in the tules in California!
To prove that the story of Amos
Quito the first is true, there is a spot
on the Seneca Reservation, so the In
dians say, where they can see the foot
prints of the first mighty insect and
the prints are twenty inches long.

gome Family Secrets Told by Mrs.
"Rapidwater" With Startling
Innocence and
Gusto.
Mrs. Gates: I am very eon-y we had any
words last night, but still I am glad I found
out what I did. Mr. Gates did not hate me
any norÂ© than I hated him or half so much,
but that la all over now. I will never cross his
p&Ui ac&in or yours either.
I have decided to end my life as I find every
one I have worked for alike. At first I thought
you were differentâ now I know you are not.
â  Mr. Gates, I have never met any one I liked
or put up with and stay by like I have you.
I like you with it all and always will. I have
tried to do what Is right but It Is no use. I go
to my death without cne regret. Good-by,
EDITH QUINX.
Such was the letter that Mrs. "Bill"
Gates, wife of the now famous "Swift
water." received from her colored ruaid,
the erratic young negress who tried to
cml her existence ci Thursday la.st by at
tempting to Jump off the ferry-boat Pied
mont.
It was not then known that this woman
played a prominent part in the matrimo
nial troubles of "Swlftwater" during his
sojourn In this city some months ago. As |
her letter to Mrs. Gates proves, her af- >
fections were not bestowed upon the male |
side of the house.
In fact, this colored belle ha.s the dis- |
tinction of aiding Mrs. "Swif twater" to
leave her husband during their stay at
the Baldwin, and which culminated In a !
euit for divorce on the part of her mis
tress.
Ever since the marriage j^f the Alaskan
miner to Miss Lam ore Edith has been
lady in waiting to the latter. Being of an
affectionate disposition, she devoted all
her time to her employer, and her kind- :
ness to Mrs. Gates became so pro-;
'nounced that it aroused the ire of "Swift
water," who demanded her discbarge. Mrs.
.Gates was loth to lose such an excellent
handmaiden, and flatly refused. This tact
bore a prominent part in the trouble that ,
followed.
"When "Swiftwater" demanded of his
wife to accompany him to Alaska and i
ehe, on the advice of her physician, re
fused, "Bill" then transferred his affec- ;
tions tn a sister, "Gussle" by name, '
and the battle was on. A suit for divorce
immediately followed, and "Bill," al- :
though a little bothered, left this city ;
with his it-w love.
"She could not have him if she tried."
eaid Mrs. Swiftwater last night. The
lady referred to her sister, who had su
perseded her In the affections of "Rush- :
ing Water."
"Why. the divorce proceedings have ;
been dropped, and everything is lovely
again. 1 expect Mr. Gates home In De
cember." t
Ensconced in a pretty flat In the center j
of the city she awaits his coming. With
out any hesitancy Mrs. Gates spoke of !
family affairs with a.n innocence that waa j
startling- "I really hope you will not
publish my new place of residence," she
said, "for If you did you would put me to |
great inconvenience. Mr. Gates is now i
in Alaska and I am living all alone. Do
you know I am a little afraid of this j
girl? When I went to my lawyer to- |

ThE CALL'S WHIST ARTICLES.
For about three years I have enjoyed
the pleasure of furnishing the readers of
the Sunday Call with a column or two
of so-called whist articles. Everything
comes tc him who waitsâ now to these
articles the end has come.
To the great majority the announce
ment of their discontinuance will no
doubt be welcome, for I know to some the
inlliction has been burdensome, but
the great minorityâ very fewâ l have
the beat of reasons to think may some
time inwardly express a slight twinge of
regret, for even an old shoe "out at the
heel," cracked and "toes out," is cast |
aside sometimes with a little feeling of
"at times you have been a faithful ana
comforting friend." To the latter I wish
to offer both hands and heartily grasp
theirs and extend my heartfelt and hum
ble thanks for the many kind acts, words
of encouragement and good cheer given
me during these years, which have more .
' than repaid me for my labors in the I
i cause of this beautiful. Intellectual home
amusement that many of us love so well.
My time is being encroached upon to
' such an extent that I feel as though I
' am at last compelled to surrender ana
lay down the ppn, or I had better say,
put aside the scissors and paste pot and
i let younger blood cast the net and reap
I some material reward for the catch. To
! me this work has always been a labor of
i love, carrying with it a charm I could I
i not dispel. How well I have performed it .
I must be left to the charity and intelli- I
I gence of the great whist jury. I believe I
I have earned a good, long rest from my
whist labors, and will from now on shape
my ends to enjoy the fruits of the game
i at the whist table. Sincerely yours.
