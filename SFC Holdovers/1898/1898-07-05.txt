SAN FKANCISCO, TUESDAY, JULY 5, 1898.
Every Spanish Vessel Lost.
The Admiral With 1600
Seamen Captured.
WASHINGTON, July 4.â The following bulletin from Commo
dore Watson was received to-night:
PLAYA DEL ESTE, July 3.â To the Secretary of the Navy:
At 9:30 A. M. to-day the Spanish squadron, seven in all, includ
ing one gunboat, came out of Santiago harbor in columns and
was totally destroyed within an hour, excepting the Cristobal
Colon, which was chased forty=five miles to the westward by the
commander-in-chief, the Brooklyn, the Oregon, and the Texas,
surrendering to the Brooklyn, but was beached to prevent sinking.
None of our officers or men were injured except on board
the Brooklyn Chief Yeoman Ellis was killed and one man
wounded.
Admiral Cervera, all the commanding officers, excepting of
the Oquendo, about 70 other officers and 1600 men are pris
oners. About 350 were killed or drowned and 160 wounded.
The latter are cared for on the Solace and the Olivette.

tion was the bold dash by which
Cervera attempted to get his fleet
out of Santiago harbor. Cervera
himself led the way with his flag
ship, the Cristobal Colon. It was
to be a dash for liberty or death,
and the Spanish admiral made
the plunge with his eyes open.
Sunday quiet rested over the
entrance to Santiago. No signs
were visible about old Morro.
Beyond and toward the city of
Santiago all was still. After two
days of fighting the armies of
both nations were resting in their
trenches. Off this way, for a dis
tance of half a dozen miles from
shore, the vessels of Sampson's
fleet lay lazily at anchor.
Admiral Sampson, desiring to
ascertain the exact condition of
the Spanish coast defenses about
Aguadores, ordered the flagship
to go that way. Weighing an
chor the New York leisurely
steamed off to the eastward. Idle
thoughts occupied the minds of
the men in the fleet. They were
speculating as they had been for
weeks when would come their
opportunity to get at the Spanish
fleet in the inner harbor.
Suddenly, as a flash, at half
past 9 o'clock, a vessel appeared
near the entrance of the harbor.
She was throwing out great
black clouds of smoke and was
pointing straight toward the
American fleet. The ease of the
American officers and sailors was
rudely disturbed. They grabbed
their glasses, scanned the harbor
entrance and were amazed to dis
cover that an armored cruiser
was coming out.
In the absence of Admiral
Sampson, Commodore Schley,
from the Brooklyn, ordered the
American warships to rush in
shore. In a few moments it was
seen the vessel emitting such a
great cloud of smoke was the
Cristobal Colon, Admiral Cer
vera's flagship. She had passed
the wreck of the Merrimac and
was making for sea at full speed.
Before Commodore Schley and
hie men could recover from their
surprise other clouds of smoke
came into view beyonc J the Cris
tobal Colon.
With a rush fully equal to the
Cristobal Colon the Almirante
Oquendo came throbbing to
ward the open sea. Behind her
came the Yizcaya, also at full
speed, while the rear was brought
up by the Infanta Maria Teresa
and the two torpedo-boat de
stroyers Furor and Pluton. This
stirring scene was so dramatic
and so unexpected it quickly put
the captain and every man of his
vessel on his mettle.
"Cervera's trying to escape,"
was the cry that resounded
through the fleet. Every Amer
ican vessel quickly weighed an
chor. The engines were started,

and one by one the great ArnerP
can warships made ready for the
| battle. Every man scampered td :
his gun, and the captains, know-.
ing that Admiral Sampson:, had
gone along the coast, ; eagerly
watched the Brooklyn/ CommcK
dore Schley's flagship. In'' a. few/
moments the Resolute . was
speeding to the eastward after
the New York, but the advance.
of the Spanish fleet was so rapid
that our men could not wait for
Admiral Sampson to get back.
Just as the Cristobal. Colon â 
was poking her nose oiit into the
open sea. Commodore Schley
sent the Brooklyn madly rush-.'

Cervera's flagship. He ordered
the Massachusetts and Oregon to.

ordering the Indiana, lowa and

In a few seconds the American â  fleet '

I The Spaniards opened fire with a 112
iTich Hontoria, and a mighty fountain
of water rose above the battle-ship and
wet her decks. The shell fell near her
bow, The Indiana replied with her 13
inch guns and a moment later let go
everything she could bring to bear. One
. of her first shells fell .on the Spanish
cruiser's deck.

the Texas to pound the Oquendo. Then
every A'mciican s-hip was in action, and
â¢ smoke strru.uded the coast and blew
away ia-zily,-- revealing geysers about
the ships where Spanish shells from the
cruisers and Morro tore the water.
â¢ Another ship emerged from the har
bor. It was the Yizcaya coming at full
speed, the smoke curling over her bow
as she took- her course to the westward
and brought her. bow guns Into play.
Behind her came the Infanta Maria
Teresa and the two Spanish much
dreaded torpedo boat destroyers, per
haps 200 yards apart.' The Maria Te
resa was received with a terrific storm
of shells. Smashed and on fire, she was
beached close to Morro.
The lowa steamed for a time for
ward with the Oquerido, and the In
diana did the same with the Visca^ya,
but as the fight thus moved westward
"it became clear the Americans were
willing- the Spanish ships should run far
â enough from Morro to lose the aid of
the guns there, and in twenty minutes
'thii* was donje.
This was a bit of strategy which was
developed under lire, and which was
accepted at once by all the American
ships without or-ders. In fact, the
Ice nften made it impossible to see
the signals which Commodore Schley
was making from the Brooklyn, so tre
mendous was the firing all along the
line.
Both the 'Oquendo and Viscaya were i
sometimes within a thousand yards of
the Indiana. The range varied, but as ;
a rule it was short and extremely dead- j
ly. Nevertheless the high speed and |
thick armor ' of their class stood the i
Spaniards in good stead, ass they fol
lowed in the path of honor marked out
by Admiral Cervera. .
Three quarters of an hour after the
action began it was evident the Span-
iards had many guns disabled and
would have to surrender. There were
terrible casualties on the .enemy's ships.
As the smoke cleared a little one could |
see the "Spanish flagship, her port j
broadside spouting smoke, still holding i
on to the westward.
The Texas and Massachusetts joined
the Indiana and. lowa, the Oquendo and |
Viscaya hugee.d the shore and steamed
after Cerve'ra, pledged to go with him
to defeat and' death. Shells burst on the I
decks of the Spanish rruisers at short j
' intervals. Often they were on fire, but |
again and 'again they extinguished the j
flames and manned again and again j
the guns from which they had been j
driven.
The green coast on their starboard.
â¢ smoked with shells which flew over
them, and 'crashing "sounds heard amid!
the thunder -of gre^al rifles told of the j
prmor-ipiercing shots driven into and
through -their protected sides. Still they

diana "and" lowp, thickly.
.â¢ The Golden Rod was close enough to
Bee all that the thick smoke did not j
hide. â¢ She was too close sometimes for j
comfort. I could not see that our bat
tleships-were hit. No doubt they were,
but it seemed that none of their guns
were silenced so terrific continued their

Commander . Wainright, like Nelson,
seem.cd .to have' a blind eye. If he were

his six'pounders to do work which was
heroic and astonishing. At one time
the Gloucester was being fired at by the
Yiecaya, 'both torpedo boat destroyers
and Mbrro. battery. That she was not
sunk arid that she had enough men
left to'wprk her guns was marvelous.
She lay' close in to where the Viscaya
rarhe. out, and ran along parallel, firing
at, the cruisers fiercely in proportion to
â¢her. size; as did the Indiana and lowa.
Captain fculate of the Viscaya prob
a.bly feared a torpedo from the Glouces
ter, for he tw'nod- loose his secondary

storm" of' shots from the battleships.
â¢ Then the destroyers came out, and the
Gloucester- accepted them at once as
parts of her contract. The destroyers
â werÂ© strong in machine guns and guns
of the three and six pounder class. It
Ee?med- that Smoke jets burst from the
destroyers in twenty places as they
Flipped along aft. r the Viscaya, and the

from the machine guns, but the yacht
Bteamed, ahead keeping the destroyers
directly between her and shore, and
â¢ â¢
hammering them. Morro was throwing
shells from behind, and occasionally
the Viscaya turned a gun or two to aid
her followers.
The yacht was often completely hid
den by smoke. I could not but won
der if she had been sunk but she al
ways forged ahead and appeared again
busier than ever. In ten minutes the
fire of the dertroyers slacked, but al
though some of the guns were disabled
their machinery was all right, and
they moved on till Morro could no long
er take part In the battle.
The New York appeared, hurrying on
the news from the Resolute that Cer
vera had dashed his wedge of cruisers
into the American fleet and was dying
gloriously. The New York was six miles
away when the destroyers saw her.
Morro thundered at Sampson as he
came within range, but the admiral
never heeded, seeing only in the dis
tance the dim forms of the Viscaya and
Oquendo, hopelessly hemmed in by a
circle of fire, and in the foreground the
Gloucester fighting two destroyers at
short range.
When the destroyers saw the flagship
they sped away from the Gloucester,
and tried to overtake the Viscaya and
get into shelter on her starboard side.
If that could not be done there ought to
be a chance to torpedo the Indiana, and
break through our line to the open sea,
where speed would save them; but the
Indiana steamed inshore and the
lowa, too, but further away, and the
Indiana's second battery had the first
destroyer's range and rained shells
upon it. Splintered and torn, but still
with her steering gear and machinery
intact, both destroyers turned back to
run for the mouth of the harbor and
seek safety inside, but it was too late.
The fight had been carried nearly
four miles west of Morro, and the New
York was already past the harbor's
mouth. The Gloucester was ready for
them close at hand. She and the de
stroyers and the Indiana formed a tri
angle of which the destroyers were the
apex, and the American fire, converg
ing, was too fierce for human beings to
withstand. One destroyer drifted into
the surf, a fire-battered wreck, and
then crept on toward the Gloucester
and New York, with her guns silent
and showing a flag of truce. She was
on fire, too, and her crew ran her ashore
to save the lives of those who had es
caped our shells. She blew up soon
after they abandoned her.
I was standing behind Dr. Slmonds
of the lowa, when the Gloucester was
in the greatest peril, and he could not
help turning from the main battle to
watch her heroic work and shouting his
hope that she would not run short of
ammunition. Her commander's skill
and courage was simply magnificent.
The Spanish admiral was lost in sjnoke
to the westward, when at a quarter be- j
fore seven o'c! k the Viscaya hoisted ;
a white flag. This was followed by the ;
Oquendo's going ashore with flames j
bursting from her decks. The lowa,
Indiana, Texas and Massachusetts |
ceased firing, the Massachusetts going ,
to join the Oregon and Brooklyn in
rounding up and smashing Cervera's"
ship.
Once headed off, the Oquendo turned
into the small bay, four or five miles
west of Santiago, where she lay close
to the land. *
With ever weakening broadsides the !
Vizcaya followed the first heading out i
as if to break through the line of bat- J
tie. The Indiana and lowa closed in. \
and their formation made her escape j
in that direction impossible. Captain
Eulate then attempted to reach the
east side of tl.e bay occupied by the !
Oquendo, but in vain. With a glass I
could see that the Vizcaya's bulwarks
near the stern had been torn away. |
Smoke poured out where shells had ex- |
ploded inside, and she was on fire. Her
gunners with the exception of those
who were rr f working the bow guns
crowded forward to escape the smoke
and fire aft.
The Oquendo was ashore, her guns
silent and smoke rising in thick black
clouds. There was a thundering of
guns to the westward now, and flashes
in smother told that Cervera still
fought, but to the eastward of his ship
lay the burning wrecks of his two de
stroyers.
The torpedo boat Ericsson was seen
coming along with the New York. The
Oquendo was helpless. The Indiana
and lowa were closing in, and shell af
ter shell burst above and aboard the
Vizcaya. Eulate hoisted a white flag
a his ship went ashore to save a rem
nant of his men, and simultaneously
went up the flag of white on the
Oquendo and down came the Hag of
Spain.
An hour and a half had elapsed since
Cervera left the harbor, and of the five
vessels which came out only the flag
ship was still in action.
Morro- battery still stormed lmpotent
ly at the New York. The American
army, with 1200 dead and wounded, was
not yet in Santiago, but Cervera's fleet
was destroyed and Cervera himself was
only struggling on because he wished to
make his defeat glorious in the eyes of
the attentive world. He had proven,
at least, that he was not bottled up so
tightly as was supposed. He had lost
four vessels and perhaps more than
half of his men, but his pennant was
still flying and some of his guns were
still in action.
Cervera passed the bay in which the
Oquendo had sought refuge and held on
a due westward course close to land,
but evidently nourishing a desperate
hope that hÂ« might break through the
line and reach free water. He had
passed in succession the Indiana, lowa
and Texas, not to speak of the little
Gloucester, which spouted 6-pound
shells at him. Since his flag appeared
outside the harbor his ship had been
struck again and again. By this time
the Vizcaya and Oquendo were practi
cally beaten, but in spite of the 12 and
13 inch shells that were rained upon
him at a range which was very short
for such guns, in spite of the fact that
his boilers and machinery were dam
aged, he held his course. From a point
a mile west of Morxo the Cristobal

ARMY, AS TOLD IN THE DISPATCHES.
Colon was invisible, frequently in low
hanging smoke from his own guns, and
also that which drifted inshore from
the battle-ships.
Clearly now it might have been better
if they had moved in circles and given
battle under the Santiago batteries,
whose aid would have lessened the odds
against him, but the Spaniards, through
splendid strategy, had not been headed
off until the batteries could no longer
train their guns on our fleet.
At 11:30 o'clock Cervera saw the Ore
gon cutting inshore ahead of him to
round him to. The smoke was very
thick. The firing was incessant. Cer
vera's available guns were no longer
well served. Shells had set fire to
his ship near the stem, and the flames
were controlled with difficulty, but the
Spanish admiral altered his course and
headed off from the coast, as if to pass
between the two ships and run for it.
It was impossible. The lowa and Texas
were already moving down to close the
gap, and the Spanish flagship, raked
by the Oregon and Brooklyn at from
a thousand to two thousand yards, and
by the lowa and Texas at longer range,
turned inshore again and ran for the
rocks, where the surf was breaking. He
still replied occasionally, and I won
dered when the smoke hid his ship
if he would be afloat when it lifted.
The Golden Rod, leaving the burning
cruisers on the beach, bore at full speed
on the lowa as she closed in on the
doomed admiral. I could discern the
Spanish flag from time to time as the
smoke drifted away and the flash of a
gun at intervals proved that the Span
iard was consistently following the idea
which led him to quit the harbor â
which was to make a glorious end.
But his ship moved slowly now, as if
disabled, and in a few minutes more
his guns were silent. Black smoke re
placed the swirling white. The flag
ship was aflame. Her men had been
unable either to work the guns or
smother the 'flames caused by bursting
shells, and she was headed for the
rocks.
She struck bow on and rested there.
Red flames burst through the black
smoke, and soon a pillar cloud rose
straight up a thousand feet and then
bent against the green mountain. Cer
vera's ship was hopelessly lost.
The American battle-ships ceased fir
ing before she struck and ran in, appar
ently with the intention of saving the
survivors as prisoners. This was evi
dently expected by the Spaniards, no
tably by the Vizcaya's men, hundreds
of whom thronged the forward deck,
watching the flames eating their way
toward them.
Dr. Simonds of the lowa, who accom
panied me and assisted me during the
engagement, said that the fourth Span
ish cruiser was unable to leave the har
bor with the others because she was
disabled.
The casualties will not be accurately
' determined until to-morrow. Evidently
the American losse.Â° were slight com
; pared with the tremendous importance
of the accomplishment of annihilating
Cervera's squadron.
The Golden Rod was the only dis
patch boat near the ships in action. I
I would have gone to Guantanamo with a
bulletin had not the Resolute headed
all non-combatants to the westward by
! the strange warning that a Spanish
i ship was comings from the eastward. As
i the Resolute ran toward the New York
; this afternoon after the engagement a
i shell from the western battery at four
1 miles' range passed a few feet over and
I ahead of the Golden Rod.
CULMINATION OF
THE GLORY OF THE
AMERICAN NAVY
NEW YORK, July 4.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Commenting on the victory
gained by Rear Admiral Sampson's
squadron off Santiago- de Cuba, Secre
tary Long said to me to-day:
"It seems almost the culmination of
glory that such news should come on
Independence day. It is Dewey's vic
tory over again â the terrific loss and
but one man killed and two w r ounded
on our side! Nobody questions the
bravery of the Spaniard, and this
makes all the more significant the su
periority of American officers and sea
men in skill, training, discipline and
efficiency. How splendidly this victory
rounds out thus far the glorious record
of the American navy!"
Captain A. S. Crowninshield, member
of the Naval "War Board and chief of
the Bureau of Navigation, Is naturally
most enthusiastic over the destruction
of Cervera's fleet.
"From the moment those ships en
tered the harbor I was confident that
they would never escape. I think the
result shows the utter ine^fficiency of
the personnel on board the Spanish
men-of-war and their lack of gunnery,
exercise and drill. The ships were first
class vessels of their respective types
and should have given Rear Admiral
Sampson's men-of-war a stiff fight.
But they inflicted such little damage as
to show the inferiority of their equip
ment to that of the American vessels
and the poor gunnery of their men as
compared with that displayed by the
Americans. The result clearly shows
that we have nothing to fear from the
Spaniards on sea."
"It was one of the boldest deeds in
naval history," said General Miles, in
speaking of Cervera's attempt to es
cape.
I asked General Miles what, should
Santiago surrender to-morrrow, would
be the idea of sending further rein
forcements to Santiago.
"To invade Cuba," he laconically re
plied.
Then General Miles added, signifi
cantly, that he would., not regard the
troops now being sent as in the nature
of reinforcements.
"If reinforcements," I asked, "to what
purpose will they be put?"
General Miles refused to answer this
question, as he declined to answer the
next, as to whether these troops would
be sent to Porto Rico. But it was re
marked by another authority with
whom I talked that there were yet
about 40,000 Spanish troops to be sub
dued in Santiago Province, and that
Santiago was a good base to move from
for an attack on Porto Rico. General
Miles having stated again positively
that he would go to Santiago, I asked
him if he would take command.
"If I were in Santiago to-night," he
replied, "I should not attempt to inter
fere with General Shafter's. plans."
BRITISH RESIDENTS
LEAVE SANTIAGO
ON THE PALLAS
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, July 4.â The
British commander of the Port Royal
at 6 o'clock this evening received a
cable message dated "Santiago, noon,"
from the captain of the British cruiser
Pallas. He stated the city had not yet
surrendered, nor V n taken by the
American army. The Pallas had taken
off the British ( onsul, Mr. Ramsden,
and 150 British subjects.
It is reported by the Consular agent
at Montego Bay, Jamaica, that the
schooner Manuel Raoul, which was
chartered by a Spanish agent to go to
Manzanillo with provisions, has been
captured by the American fleet.
DEMANDED INSTANT
AND UNCONDITIONAL
SURRENDER OF SANTIAGO

OFF JURAGUA, ON BOARD THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
BOAT DANDY, Sunday, July 3, 10 p.
m. (via Port Antonio, Jamaica, and
Kingston, July 4, 12:45 p. m.). â General
Shatter to-day demanded an instant
and unconditional surrender of Santi
ago de Cuba. The Spanish commander
curtly and emphatically refused.
This evening Lieutenant Colonel As
tor of General Shafter's staff was in
formed by a courier that the Spanish
generals were considering terms of
surrender. The courier's report, how
ever, is altogether unconfirmed and is
discredited by General Shatter.
To-night the men are anxious for a
general engagement on the Fourth of
July, but the officers do not expect it.
The general belief is that the crushing
of Admiral Cervera's fleet entirely
changes the situation, now that Ad
miral Sampson can enter the harbor
and the army and navy can make a
combined attack on the city. It ia not
believed that General Shafter will make
a decisive move until that question is
definitely settled.
Admiral Sampson and General Shaf
ter had arranged for a conference this
morning and an escort of cavalry was
at the dock here awaiting Admiral
Sampson and his staff. Admiral Cer
vera's dash for liberty compelled the

to the scene of conflict. The conference
was interrupted to wipe out the Spanish
fleet, but will doubtless be resumed.
SPAIN AFRAID TO
ADMIT THE LOSS
OF CERVERA'S FLEET
MADRID, July 4.â Thunderstorms
very heavy and causing fatalities have
partially interrupted telegraph commu
nication, and only meager news is pub
lished.
There are great rejoicings over Ad
miral Cervera's quitting the harbor of
Santiago, but there is an undercurrent
of great anxiety as to his fate. It is
considered preferable that he even
should succumb to Admiral Sampson's
superior forces than remain to be sunk
by General Shafter's artillery.
General Blanco cables as follows:
"No details have been received as to
the naval fight, but it is rumored that
Admiral Cervera reached a port of
southern Cuba."
It is officially announced that the last
vessels of Admiral Carnara's squadron
have passed the Suez Canal.
The following semi-official statement
was issued this afternoon:
"The semaphore from Morro Castle
to Santiago says the .Spanish squadron,
after a cannonade with the Amerkans
showed no signs of injury, therefore the
American news of the rout of Admiral
Cervera must be utterly untrue. More
over, Admiral Cervera's squadrds is
faster than Admiral Sampson'?."
An official dispatch from Santiago de
Cuba says:
"Admiral Cervera's fleet sustained for
an hour the fire of the American fleet.
It then disappeared westward, followed
by the American squadron. We lost
two torpedo-boat destroyers."
The dispatch announces as follows:
"To General Shafter's demand for the
surrender of the city, expiring at 10
o'clock the next morning, the Spanish
commander replied: "It is my duty
that orders me to defend the place to
the end."
The Ministers, on leaving the Cabinet
council, said they knew nothing of Ad
miral Cervera's squadron further than
the dispatches revealed.
Lieutenant General Correa, Minister
of War, said he believed Admiral Cer
vera had gone to Havana.
At the conclusion of the Cabinet meet
ing yesterday the Ministers stated that
official confirmation had been received
that General "Veraderoy and two of
General Linares' aids-de-camp were
among the killed in the third attack
of the Americans on El Caney. It was
stated that the American losses exceed
2000.
The Government has no news from
Aguadores. It is reported that Linares
has succumbed to his wounds, but this
report is unconfirmed.
SAMPSON'S FAMILY
CELEBRATES THE
ADMIRAL'S VICTORY
NEW YORK, July 4.â Mrs. Sampson,
wife of the irear admiral, with her fam
ily, celebrated the Fourth, her hus
band's promotion to be commodore, and
his great victory all together to-day at
the Sampson home in Glen Ridge, N. J.
The house was decorated with flags,
and the rear admiral's children kept the
neighborhood noisy all day with fire
crackers and explosives. , Mrs. Samp
son was overjoyed with the news from
Santiago, and joined heartily in the
celebration carried on by the young
sters. When asked about her husband's
victory she said:
. "I am very happy. No words can
express the joy and relief I feel. This
is the first really happy day I have had
in six months. While I always hoped
for the best and knew our fleet would
be victorious in the end, and had every
confidence in my husband and in the
strength of his fleet, still I constantly
feared that when they came to close
quarters with thu enemy my husband's
life would be in danger. He was in
danger, cf course, but he has come
through safely and co have his men, so
it does not matter what the risk was;
it's past. The news that came this
morning seemed at first too good to be
all true."
Mrs. Sampson then spoke of how
proud she and her family were of the
country and its successes and how
doubly proud they were to think that
the rear admiral had contributed
toward the triumphs being won in the
war.
The widow's cap dates back to old
Egyptian days, when people shaved their
hair close to the head in time of mourn
ing and then put on caps to avoid taking
cold.
AMERICAN
LOSSES AT
SANTIAGO
Special cable to The Tall and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
GENERAL SHAFTER'S HEAD
QUARTERS, BEFORE SANTIAGO,
July 3 (by Call-Herald dispatch-boat
Golden Rod to Port Antonio, thence to
Kingston, Jamaica, July 4). â With the
destruction of Admiral Cervera's fleet
the work of taking Santiago becomes ;
much less difficult. As lc-ng as General
Shafter had no siege guns and could
not be assisted by a friendly fleet in j
the harbor the capture of the city :
promised to be a hard task, and it ;
would be practically impossible to hold j
the city if it were captured.
It is now estimated that between 1200 ;
and 1500 Americans are dead, wounded j
or missing after the two days' fighting
about Santiago. I am told by one of
the surgeons who assisted in the hospi
tal work that probably from 250 to 300
Americans were killed.
No official list or official estimate of
the dead and wounded can be obtained
yet. Unofficial estimates, place bur I
losses as high as 2000, and to date 450 ;
men suffering from wounds that are j
not serious have been brought to the.!
hospital.
Our surgeons have not enough" sup- i
plies, bandages or nurses and the mcdi- â !
cal staff is too small.
Two hundred men from General
Wheeler's division now lie wounded in
the hospital at Siboney. With them are
two hundred from General Lawton's
division.
Among the wounded are Colonel Pat
terson, commanding Twenty-second In
fantry; Lieutenant Deveraux of the
Rough Riders; Lieutenant Murphy of
the Twenty-fourth Infantry; Captain
Mosher of the Twenty-second Infantry;
Lieutenant Godfrey of the Twenty-secj
ond Infantry, whose wounds are slight,
and Captain Jones and Lieutenant
Marshall, both of the Twenty-second
Infantry.
Lieutenant Deveraux was a well
known Princeton football player. Lieut
enant Garastre, a son of the famous
general, and a pet with the army, was .
killed while displaying most dis- |
tinguished gallantry. He was a mem- j
ber of General Hawkins' . staff. Lieu- j
tenant Michie, also of General Hawk- \
ins' staff, was killed.
All ranking officers of the cavalry di
vision were disabled. Both Wheeler I
and Young are ill, as are Sumner, j
Wood and Lieutenant Colonel Carroll.
When Carroll was wounded Lieutenant ;
Colonel Hamilton took his command. !
Hamilton was killed soon afterward, !
and Major Weasels, who then took
command, was wounded.
Colonel Wood seamed to escape by .a
succession of miracles. Lieutenant
Roosevelt was not hurt, although he
was everywhere in the thick of the
fight.
The cavalry division lost thirtj offi
cers killed and wounded, and at one
time a captain was in command of the
regiment. Nearly half of the enlisted;
men in the cavalry were wounded.
The artillery forces were nearly as
badly off as the Michigan troops at
Aguadores. They encountered the
enemy in trenches and on a flat cor,
which was armored and armed with
machine guns. This checked their ex
pected advance toward Morro, which
Rear Admiral Sampson had hoped they
would occupy after he had shelled the
batteries.
There is said to be no doubt General
Shafter's next move will be to- push the
troops forward alone: the railroad track
to attack with the fleet the outer bat
teries at the mouth of the harbor. As
soon as these defenses have been si
lenced and put into possession of c-ur
forces Rear Admiral Sampson will be
able to free the harbor of mines and
pend his ships into the inner harbor.
That done, the Spaniards would be
compelled to surrender the city at once.

less),âFour batteries of artillery which
were placed in position this morni.ng
tegfCn the day by bombarding the San
Juan quart or of Santiago, and the
Spanish position in front of our right.
After a; quarter of an hour's shelling
General Lawton's troops, which had
been re-enforcad, pressed forward upon
the -enemy's left Hank, pouring in an
exceedingly hot fire, which was con
tinued during the greater part of the
afternoon.
It is not intended to force the fight-
Ing before to-morro.w, the present plan
being to turn the Spanish left, taking
the whole -line enfilade, and thus to
obtain a speedy entrance into the up-
Der end of the city.
Lieutenant Wainwright opened fire
upon them alone with his six-pounders.
Both destroyers and the Yizcaya
â  â¢pened on the plucky little yacht In
spite o\ all she could do, the destroyers
! her and left her astern.
Lieutenant Wainwright got another
chance, however. When the destroyers
encountered the deadly rain of missiles
from the battle-ships beyond their com
manders quickly came to the conclu
sion that discretion was the better part
if valor and turned back in the hope
of saving themselves in the harbor.
They reckoned without the Glouces
ter. She was waiting for them and re
newed the engagement as soon as they
came within range of her small guns.
They replied as before, and the Glou
cester, as before, sustained their fire
without flinching.
This duel between two of Spain's
must dreaded craft on one side and the
converted American yacht on the other
was the most thrilling feature of the en
tire engagement. The Gloucester was
apparently damaged by the shot poured
into her by the destroyers, but with
marvelous bravery she gave them shot
for shot, doggedly determined to pre
vent their escape.
The courage of her commander in the
face of such tremendous odds was final
ly rewarded. The terrible fire of the
destroyers slackened and a cheer went
up from the Gloucester as it was seen
that they were on fire. Both turned
their noses to the shore and crowded on
steam.
They had need of haste, for one of
Admiral Sampson's heavy guns
thundered at intervals all the fore
noon, and the American shells were
distinctly seen to explode with tre
mendous force and loud detonations be
yond the San Juan barracks, over
which numerous Red Cross flags were
flying.
The concentration of the American
j battery on what is now dubbed
"Grimes' Hill," near our left, was the
result of a blunder made last night in
posting our guns so near the Spanish
infantry intrenchments that they could
not be properly supported. The idea of
a cross artillery fire was abandoned,
but the position occupied by the bat
teries on our right was not relin
quished.
The rifle firing at that point at one
time was as heavy as anywhere along
the line. The Spaniards kept up the
volley, firing for fully an hour, but the
deliberate spacing of our own shots
showed that our men, as usual, were
cool and effective In their work.

them blew up as her crew was plunging
into the surf. The other was beached
and her men scrambled ashore.
Admiral Sampson with the flagship
returned in time to send two shots at
I the destroyers, but it was the Glouces
ter that cut off their retreat and de
â  feated them in fair fight. Both de
; stroyers were burned on the beach.
While the Gloucester was disposing
of the Furor and Pluton, the Cristobal
Colon, Almirante Oquendo, Infanta
Maria Teresa and Vizcaya were making
a desperate but hopeless struggle to the
bor succeeded in getting an approxi
mate range angle of our advance on
the left and sent in many heavy shells,
which exploded close to the intrench
ments. It was realized late yesterday
that we might have hard fighting to
day in order to maintain this advanced
position around the large blockhouse
or so-called fÂ»rt. Strong intrenchments
were, therefore, thrown up there dur
ing- the night.
Thus far to-day the Spanish infantry
have let those works severely alone.
Near this position 200 Spanish soldiers
and 62 officers were captured this morn
ing. Both these and the 2000 prisoners
taken yesterday on the right marched
to the rear during the forenoon. The
expression on all their faces was ex
ceedingly sullen.
There are many evidences of disloyal
methods of warfare on the part of the
Spaniards yesterday. One of their bat
teries, masked by a blockhouse over
which the Red Cross flag was flying, on
the road leading from General Shafter's
quarters, on the Rio Sevilla, to the
front, has been for two days infested
at various points by sharpshooters, who
fired deliberately upon our wounded
and upon our men who were enaged. It
is supposed they had stolen through
our lines to the right, taking refuge
in the hospitals.
In the trenches secured by us many
shelis of explosive bullets have been
found.
The Impression appears to be well
founded that the Spanish losses, most
ly in dead, will probably amount to
3000 killed and wounded. The losses of
the Spaniards are much heavier than
ours. In some of the trenches the
corpses lay in unbroken lines, and occa
sionally two or three deep.
It was not General Shafter's inten
tion to attempt a general assault on
the Spaniards to-day unless our bom
bardment and General Lawton's oblique
fire on our right developed an excep
tional opportunity. The morninc- or
ders were to confine our principal oper
ations to the defense of the positions
we have taken, and re-enforcements for
the whole line were sent forth early in
the forenoon. The Second Regular In
fantry was sent to the right and the
Ninth Massachusetts and the Thirty
third and Thirty-fourth Mlehigun to
the centerâ in all about 2000 fresh
troops.
The formation of the line to-day is
as follows: General Lawton on the
westward. Between the Vizcaya,
Oquendo and Maria Teresa and the In
diana, Texas and lowa the battle waged
furiously along the shore.
It was a running fight. Though the
Spaniards, fired with the energy of de
spair, their gunnery was poor and most
of their shots went wild The Ameri
cans, on the contrary, repeatedly hit the
moving targets offcrcl by the enemy.
Bursting shells set iirc to the Spanish
cruisers and their commander ran them
on the beach and ran up the white Hag
in token of surrender.
The Vizcaya touched shore about four
miles from the Morro. 1 saw hundreds
on her forward deck, apparently afraid
to leap overboard on account of the
sharks. The vessel was on fire from her
stem to amidships and the flames were
leaping high over her deck. It seemed
as though a terrific explosion would an
nounce at any moment that the fire had
reached the magazine.
I saw the Oquendo about a quarter
of a mile west of the Vizcaya, on the
beach, wrapped in smoke and flames. I
could hear a scries of dull, heavy ex
plosions as the fire reached her ammu
nition, probably that intended for the
secondary battery.
From this point I could also see
mighty columns of smoke rolling: high
above the crest of the coast range of
mountains, marking the spot where Ad
miral Cervera's flagship lay burning ten
miles from Morro. She made the hard
est fight of any of the Spanish fleet and
yielded last. Battered by the shot and
shell of all the American vessels, Ad
miral Cervera was finally forced to show

CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL, MIL
ITARY PARK, Ga., July 4.â The rail
road companies this afternoon had all
trains on the siding at Rossville and
Rinpgold to carry the six regiments of
troops ordered to the front yesterday,
and to-night the Southern Railroad
had sent a Pullman train to Rossville
to get General Wilson, who was to be
in command of the expedition, and his
staff, who were to leave to-night for
Charleston. At Rossville the trainmen
received orders to return to the city,
an order having been received from
Washington rescinding the order to
move the troops. It is understood from
this that the department had made a
complete change of plans, and that no
regiments are to be moved from this
point for some time.
A handsome sword was presented to
General Grant by Mr. Cone of New

GLORIOUS
NEWS ON THE
NATAL DAY
Series of Victories That
Cause Americans to
Thrill With Joy.
To Cap the Climax the Fall of
Santiago de Cuba Must
Occur Very Soon.
WASHINGTON, July 4.â The com
plete annihilation of the Spanish squad
ron at Santiago and the rapture of ;he
Spanish admiral. Cervera, with 1600
prisoners; the demand by General Shaf
ter for t!. Li r of Santiago by 12
o'clock, to-morrow noon on pain of burn
bardrncnt: word from Admiral Dewey
that the Ladrone Islands had been cap
tured: that a Spanish gunboat had sur
rendered; that a hundred or more Span
ish officers And men were taken, and
that our first Philippine expedition had
landedâ this is in part the thrilling rec
ord of such a Fourth of July as has
not been known since the bells of Inde
pendence Hall rang out the tidings of
American freedom.
It was a -day when one momentous
event followed another in constant and
rapid succession, each hour bringing
forth snni e new feature more startling
than what had gone before. The climax
â¢came at 1 o'cloe 1 - when, amid the wild
eft cheering, which fairly \ shook the
great War, F*~' and Navy building to I
its foundation, Admiral Sampson's die
â  patch announcing his glorious" victory
and the- entire destruction of the Span
ish fleet was given to the public.
The White. House was naturally the
fecal point of .the enthusiasm and stir- :
ring activity which ' marked official \
"Washington.- It was the busiest day
the President has had since . the war
began. Conference followed conference j
with -the â¢. .heads of the military .and i
naval departments, high officials of the !
service ca.me and went in a constant i
and- steady. Stream, and as each hour â 
brought its added luster to the Ameri
can "aims the crowd of officials in
creased.- â¢'â ', '/. [. â â 
The President had not a moment's
respite.-- Telegrams came' and went
without cessation, and the historic old
mansion presented a scene - such as has
not been paralleled since the momen
toas hours oT the civil war.
The story of the day is best told in
the series, of official dispatches, each
bearing date of July 4, from Sampson,
f.'.;n :?hafter and from Dewey; '. Stir
ring as they all are, that of Sampson
. was accorded the honor of chief im- j
portance, not only for the immediate re- j
sults secured, but also from the effects
of this crushing defeat in weakening '
the defenses of the city of Santiago and
in dealing Spain such a staggering blow
that she is left practically without a
navy. â¢ .', ,/'
. The admiral's dispatch is. as follows:
PLAVA, VIA HAYTI. â -To Secre
tary of the Navy, 3:15 a. m., SI honey,

within four miles of the port. Loss,

" Although, brief Admiral Sampson's
dispatch tells the story of fearful de
struction. It not only disclosed the tre
mendous prowess of the American fleet,
but it again displayed the immunity
which the American sailor seems to
have in the midst of death and carnago.
That but one of our sailors, a yeoman
on the Brooklyn, shguld have been kill
, ed in an engagement of this magnitude
is without a parallel jn naval annals

through a baptism of fire recently, and
are little I ore than ruins. Thus, with
Bhafter'B puna thundering on Santiago
from the land and Sampson's from the
harbor, the fall of the city is assured
beyond further question.
The authorities, military and naval,
say that Santiago has already made its
best fight, and that its occupation is
only a question of time, ad very brief
time.
General Shafter's strong position was
shown in a series of dispatches. Most
convincing of all as to his feeling of
co fldence and strength was that dis
patch given out late in the day, in
which General Phafter gives the* text
of his demand for the surrender of the
city on pain of bombardment. This
dispatch is as follows:

Following Is the Spanish reply,
with which Colonel Dorst has just
retnrned, at Â«;::;<> p. ni.j
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, 2 p. m., July

commanding the , forces of the
United States, San Jnan River Sir:
I have the honor to reply to your

foreign citizens, women and chil
dren that they must leave the city
before 10 o'clock to-morrow morn-

that this city will not surrender and
that I will inform the foreign Con

The British, Portuguese, Chinese
and Norwegian Consuls have come
to my line with Colonel Dorst. They
ask If non-combatants can occupy
the town of Caney and railroad
points, and ask until 1O o'clock of
the sth Inst. before the city is fired
on. They claim that there are be
tween 15,000 and 20,000 people,
many of them old, who will leave.
They ask if I can supply them with
food, which I cannot do for want
of transportation to Caney, which
is fifteen miles from my landing.

SHAFTER, Major General, Com
manding.
General Shafter's other dispatches
breathe the same air of confidence and
determination as shown in his demand
on the Spanish commander. The first
one made public during the day stated
that his lines completely surrounded
the town, from the bay on the north to
San Juan River on the south, leaving
the city thus enveloped by a stretch of
water on one side and a stretch of
frowning American guns on the other.
In another dispatch General Shafter
epitomized the strength of his position
by saying:
"I feel that I am master of the situa
tion, and can. hold the enemy for any
length of time."
In another dispatch General Shafter
states that hi.- demand for the surren
der of Santiago is still being considered
by the Spaois-h authorities, which indi
cates that ;the. refusal of the Spanish
commander to capitulate was not final.
In any event, 12 o'clock on Tuesday
marks the limil of Shafter's concession,
and if Santiago has not capitulated at
that hour, the great siege guns, now
brought to the front and in position,
aided fby t.he batteries of lighter, field
pieces, will begin their work of destruc
tion.
General Shafter'u series of telegrams
are as follows:

Special cable to The Call and the New fork ,

don Bennett.
EL POZO BLOCKHOUSE, SANTI
AGO, Saturday, July 2, by The Call-
Herald dispatch-boat Golden Rod, to
Kingston, Jamaica, Monday, July 4. â A
sortie in force was made by the Span
iards last night at sunset upon the
troops that held the hills of San Juan.
Our dismounted cavalry and the Sixth
and Sixteenth Regular Infantry, who
had captured the position, had been re
enforced by the Seventy-first New York [
Vulunteers and the Ninth, Thirteenth
and Twentieth Regulars.
At the time the Spaniards made this
final effort of the day to retake their
lost position our men were strung out
in single line for more than a mile.
They held the hills, but no more. Re
enforcements had left to help them on
the left, but Lawton on the right had
not been heard from, being busily en
gaged at Caney. It seemed a case of
all night or Lawton, but without re
enforcements and without Lawton' a di
vision , the single line of blue for. the
time withstood the attack of the Span
ish. The Spanish fire was too hot,
however, and forced the Americans to
fall back below the crest of the hills
until it ceased. After that, except for
an irritating picket fire, which contin
ued all night to their right, there were
a few hours of comparative peace.
Early on Saturday, by the order of
General Shafter, Major pillenback,'s
battery advanced to within 400 yards
of the Spanish lines on the right. Dil
lenback entrenched under the cover of
darkness, and at sunrise began shell
ing Santiago City and the Spanish bar
racks. He was instantly answered by
two' 6-inch guns, one 3-inch and a mer
ciless infantry fire, which, it is sup
posed, came from the troops driven
back by Lawton from Caney. Our ar
tillerymen could not stand up against
it and loaded their guns while lying
Jon their stomachs. Captain Parkhurst
was wounded in the arm, and
many of the men of the bat
: teries were disabled. The Amer
ican batteries were forced to fall back
on El Pozo, from where they had begun
firing on Friday morning. The bat
tery should. never have heen ordered to
the front to face the effective fire of
modern infantry. The placing of the
| battery within 400 yards of the infantry
line was suicidal.
Capron's battery arrived from the
right just as Dillenback arrive! from
the front. They constitute all the ar
tillery we have, sixteen guns In all.
There should be ; eighty or a hundi yd
guns. When this movement began the
horses had not been out of their harness
for a day and a- night and neither
officers nor men had had. food for thirty
six hours. At this writing, 9 o'ck,-ck
Saturday moralr^, the horses are
being watered nv.ii the men are getting
some coffee preparatory to establish
ing themselves and si* el ling the city at
a range of 3006. â  ..yards. Lawton anil
Chaffee, after an all-night march from
Caney, are now coming to the front to
Join the men who took and still hold the
ridges of San Juan, three-quarters of a
mile from the city.
! eral Shafter is no longer felt, now that
; the Spanish fleet is out of the way.- A
j large nutnber of men, however, are al
t'ready on the way, and others will fol-
I lov.\
The changed naval situation will
I bring no abatement in the activity of
! the authorities here in carrying the war
i directly home to Spain. There is re
newed determination to get Commodore
Watson's' eastern squadron away at the
earliest. moment, for .the double purpose
of striking a blow at the coast towns of
Spain- and of pursuing Admiral Ca
mara's- fleet, which has halted at the
entrance of the Suez Canal. Secretary
Long made the official statement to-day
that the fleet would sail at the earliest
possible moment, and although he did
riot go into details as to its purpose, it
is well understood that it will devote its
attention to the. Spanish Coast and to
Camara. The destruction of the Span
ish fleet at Santiago relieves Admiral
Sampson from surveillance of this
squadron, and he can readily spare the
ships intended for the attack on the
Spanish coast.
It has been Acting Admiral Sampson
for some time, but that it will be Ad
miral Sampsoi. in fact as well as in
name ts the prevailing feeling in naval
circles, as a result of the victory, re
ported by the American admiral. Short
ly after the war broke out Captain
Sampson was made acting admiral in
order to give him a rank befitting his
hi.trh command, although L.s actual na
.val rank remains captain. By a singu
lar coincidence his rank was advanced
to-day to that of commodore, owing to
;! â  retirement of Admiral Kirkland. In
Che event of his now being made an
admiral itwould advance him over the
ten commodores making up the list of
that grade,, and would place him just
be-low- thÂ«U very famous hero of the
war, Admiral Dewey.
The release of Hob'son and the other
heroes of tile Merrimac incident is
likely to be another result of the events
transpiring- to-day. It may now come
about either by surrender of the city,
which would include the surrender of
Hobsoh and other American prisoners
in the city, or else by the exchange of
Ilobson for Admiral Cervera or some
other high ranking naval official. Until
to-day the possibility of exchanging
ii'isuri were slight, as this Govern
ment had no Spanish prisoners, of high
rank to offer in his place. Now, how
ever, they have one of the foremost ad
mirals of Spain, and among the 1300
other naval prisoners there are many
officers of disUr^rutFhed rank. To ex
change a Spanish admiral for an Amer
ican naval constructor might seem
strange under ordinary circumstances,
but it would be done without any be
grudging by the authorities here, and
would be particularly appropriate in
view of the action of Cervera at the
time Hobson surrendered to him.
Adjutant-General Corbin sent the fol
lowing telegram to Shafter this after
noon:
An noon nn > >v can do ho advis
edly, telefirnph me your recom
mendations for promotion.
This action was taken at the instance
of the President and Secretary Alger.
A remarkable feature of the fighting
in Cuba, and one much commented
upon in military circles, is the heavy
]<>.-.. in killed and wounded of commis-
I sioned and non-commissiojied officers.
In ppite of the distress which the loss
of so many officer* has occasioned the
! army officials point to the list as splen
did evidence of the dash and personal
bravery of the mop who wear shoulder
Straps. Among the Wiled and wounded
since the first fipht at Juragua have
been officers of every grade from colonel
down and in numbers said to be almost
unprecedented in proportion to the
forces engaged. The loss of officers in
i the two days' fighting around Santiago
demonstrates to military men that the
American officers lead their men
viv rover they are called to go and are
setting an example which cannot but
elevate the esprit de corps of the army.
An element of the fight that exas
perated the men was the discovery of
many sharpshooters in trees along" the
tiriil. The courage of these guerrillas
cannot be overestimated, as they were
absolutely cut off from their own forces,
but their methods are beyond belief.
They kept up a steady fire on the dress
ing station 6f the field hospital, and
before their hiding places were discov
ered killed and wounded many sur
geons and others of the hospital* corps,
besides soldiers who were already
wounded.
A detail was sent into the woods to
sc mt for these men, and already six of
them hare been discovered- in the
tranches of trees and disposed of. Their
oi ofhcers and aids passing beneath
methods also included the picking off
them along the trail. For a' long time
their fire was supposed to be spent bul
lets of the enemy.
What the day would bring forth it
was impossible to aay after the first
attack of . our forges. Our men had
been under fire for twenty-four hours
and in a heat that is cruel. There is no
.shade on the hills. Rations had been
left in the rear with. the blanket rolls.
Several of the generals advised
Shafter to suspend all operations for a
day to allow the troops to get food and
rest, urging that as they had the key to
the city there seemed to be no good rea
son why .they should not take time to
recuperate. It is now admitted by every
one that the courage of the Spaniards
hria been underestimated, but they can
not stand up under the steady advance
of Americans.
. Our own loss was cruelly-severe, espe
cially among the officers who obliter
ated themselves so nobly. Three com
panies of the Twenty-fourth regulars
are entirely without officers. Major
Markley commands a regiment, and
Captain Anman . commands the Thir
tieth regulars, all his senior officers
having been disabled. There could toe
no finer sight than these same officers
coming back to the front as soon as
their wounds were dressed, and com
njnndingr their men with their arms in
slings or their wounds wrapped with
bli iy bandages.
The dynamite gun of the Rough Rid
ers rendered effective service on Fri
day. The report that the Borrowe
brothers were killed- is incorrect. The
gatling guns, were also of the greatest
service. It is a pitythere are so few of
them and that the infantry has been
called upon to do the work the artillery
could have- accomplished without this
cruel loss of life.
There is only one consolation, and
that is that the infantry and dis
mounted cavalry and their officers have
demonstrated the courage of American
soldiers and volunteers. Their advance
and charge-up the hills of San Juan
were a succession of forlorn - hopes.
They shoujd never have been asked to
make such sacrifice, but they made it
.and the picture of them as they reached
. the cres,t- of the hills, cheering, and
planted their flags among spent car
tridges of the enemy should be histor
ical.
As I conclude thig dispatch the artil
lery is preparing to bombard Santiago
and we have good hopes of celebrating
the Fou-Th of July in the plaza of the
chief city of Enstern Cuba.

MANILA BAY, July 1, via Hong
kong, July 4. â The Charleston and her
convoys reached the harbor yesterday
afternoon with all on board well. Cap
tain Glass received sealed orders at
Honolulu to stop at the island of Gua
han and destroy the Spanish fortifica
tions and ships there. He arrived off
the Island on June 20 and entered the
harbor of San Luis de Apro. Nothing
was known of the strength of the for
tifications and the Charleston steamed
in, throwing thirteen shells from her.
secondary battery at old Fort Santa
Cruz, at the head of the bay. There
was no reply, although the fort was
struck three times, and it was evident
the place was abandoned.
Some Spanish officers from Piti, Port
of Agana, who came aboard that after
noon, were made prisoners and sent
ashore on parole to notify the Governor
of the Ladrone Islands to come aboard
the Charleston. The officers said they
had received no notification of the ex
istence of a state of war between Spain
and the United States, and were taken
entirely by surprise when the Charles
ton opened fire.
The Governor's secretary brought a
letter stating that the Governor would
not board a foreign warship, and invit
ing Captain Glass to come ashore for a
conference. Captain Glass called the
transports Pekin Australia and Syd
ney into the harbor and began making
preparations to dispatch a landing par
ty 200 strong to Piti to march to Agann
the next day to find the Governor and
bring him aboard.
While the party was getting ready
early next morning I accompanied
Lieutenant Braunersreuther in a small.
boat to Piti, where we found Governor
Don Juan Mareno with his rtaff. After
a short parley, the Governor surren
dered Guahan Island with all his
troops, stores, supplies and munitions
of war and the whole group of the La
drone Islands. The Governor was
taken against his protest, leaving
orders for the troops at Agana to march
down to Piti for disarment.
Lieutenant Braunersreuther went
back to Pitf with a force of/ marines
late in the afternoon to look after the
Spanish soldiers. He disbanded a like
number of native militia and captured
54 Mausers, 64 Remington rifles and
four Spanish flags.
The Spanish troops, with the Gover
nor and six officers, were put aboard
the Sydney. The Spanish soldiers did
not relish captivity and. 1t became ap
parent later that they would have
given trouble if they had not been
taken wholly by surprise.
It was a scene of pity during the dis
arming of the troops and most affect
ing, many of the soldiers shedding tears
when their arms were taken.
I accompanied Captain Glass on the
afternoon of June 21 to Fort Santa Cruz,
where he raised the United States flag,
the Charleston saluting with twenty
one gu-ns in token of American sover
eignty over the Ladrone group.
The voyage to Manila Bay Was with
out incident. The troops are in excel
lent health. Ellas Hutchinson of Com
pany M. First Oregon Regiment, died
aboard the Sydney of appendicitis on
June 17 and was buried at sea,
MANILA, July 2, via Hongkong,
July 4. â It is stated by a Spaniard in
highest authority that Spain has ceded
Yolo, in the Sulu Islands, to Germany,
which will maintain an autonomy on
the remainder of the islands under
Spanish protection. The Princess-Wil
helm and Irene have left in the bay a
small party of half caste Chinese. The
agitation for autonomy under Spain
has no support from the natives, but
they say they have strong foreign sup
port. It is further stated that if the
Americans bombard Manila the Ger
mans will intervene. Aguinaldo's
party, seeing the attitude of Germany,
will cling closer to America.
Persons occupying high positions and
in possession of state secrets should not
lose their tempers. Two nights ago
in the house of a very high Spanish of
ficial, the theme of conversation was
the present war and its possible com
binations. There was only one Eng
lishman present and he had rather a
bad time hearing England stultified on
all hands. The personage to whom I
have alluded suddenly called for his
sword as though to give greater weight
to his words, exclaiming
''England is to blame and she only
for this war. 1 trust Imay live to see
her:cut up into mincemeat by the great
European powers.
"Spain has already ceded Yolo in the
Sulu Islands to Germany. ' Other na
tions will step in to prevent England
and America carrying out their designs
on the Philippines.. Within a fe\v days
fourteen Russian warships will anchor
in this bay. If the Americans attempt
to bombard Manila, German warships
will fire on them. England is responsi
ble for the conflagration that will fol
low."
And much more was said to the same
effect. His words may be empty,
spoken in impotent rage, but even this
seems to indicate they contain as much
truth fi.s bombast.
MANILA, June 27, vf-a Hongkong,
July 4. â German Consul Herr Malahon
has tried to -Ingratiate hhnseif with the
rebels, but found that the rebels treat
ed him with reserve. The feeling
against the Germans is very bitter
among the rebels, but they are most
friendly toward the English.
Germany is on the grab and both na
tives and Spaniards regard her with
suspicion and dislike. Senor Sfgginl,
manager of the Manila railway, w.ent
up the line a week ago with the object
of seeing if he could begin repairing.
He has not returned and it is supposed
the rebels-will prevent repairs.
The Yensoif on her last trip took Mr.
Price of Smith, Beli & CÂ». to Dagupan,
p; ovinoe of Pangasinan. His object
was to visit Smith, Bell & Co.'s rice
mills at Bayambaud and Geroua, but he
could not get through. He found the
railway blocked by trenches and also
learned that Dugupan, the. most im
portant town and port in Nagasian, was
to be attacked, so he hurried back to
Quenspeg, the rebels assisting him
throughout the journey.
A few Spanish troups and twenty-flve
priests have taken refuge m Dagupan.
Mr. Price reports the ivnole province
of Pangasinan is in the -hands of the
rebels. I was informed by Mr. Price
that the mills are uninjured, the Euro
pean and native staffs working without
danger from the rebels.
Ammunition Is being brought â  into
Manila from San Juan dcs Monte and
Santawesa, the Spaniards apparently
having abandoned those outposts.
I have reason to believe the powder
magazine cannot hold against vigor
ous attack. General Aguinaldo save he
will attack Manila \vh?n he is "ready
with 30,000 armed men and artillery.
General Moret, with the captain gen
eral's family, arrived at 1 o'clock to
day, after a-n exciting journey In the
Banco. 1 had no time to get the de
tails. The General says the Banco came
through a coniinuous-fire from the reb
els, and had a miraculous escape. He
speaks of victories gained, towns de
stroyed and 1000 rebels killed, etc' I be
lieve, these prisoners of war came
through with the permission of Aguin'
aldo.
General Moret returned without any
troops under his command, whicii does
not look like victoy.
Probably these important prisoners
have been exchanged on condition that
the Spanish force surrender with arms
and ammunition.
General Moret says he trusts hts sol
diers will arrive here, and also that the
remainder of the Spanish refugees,
male and female, and this will depend
on whether they are cut oft by the
rebels or not and so far" there; 'is no
news of them.
HONGKONG, July 4.â The United
States dispatch boat Zafiro arrived to
day. Sbe reported that Rear Admiral
Dewey and General Anderson are in
discussion iis to whether to immediate
ly attack or await the next brigade.
In addition to the Spanish Governor
of the Ladrones the Charleston brought
forty officers as prisoners of war to
Cavite.
The gunboat Hugh McCulloch cap
tured,, this afternoon, the gunboat
Leyte. -Admiral Dewey offered to pa
role the crew, but they declined be
cause they fea: _d being court-martial
ed and 'shot.
Captain Concha, .late commander of
the Spanish thifd-class - unprotected
cruiser Don Antonio de Ulloa, v.-hirh
was sunk at the battle of Cavite, com
mands Malate Fort with 400 sailors. A
thousand mixed troops are camped
about a half-mile south. The insur
gents apparently, the Zaflro reports,
fear to leave cover.
Arsachio, the Insurgent- leader, who
was arcested by Aguinaldo, will, the in
surgents think, be shot, as General
Aguinaldo fears a conspiracy against
himself.
SHANGHAI, July 4.â It Is reported
here on good authority that J&ermany
has arranged a 'concession for a port
in the Philippines antedating the pres
ent situation.
WASHINGTON, July 4.â Admiral
Dewey's telegram to the Navy Depart
ment is given out aa follows:
"HONGKONG, July 4, Cavite, July 1..
â Three transports and the Charleston
arrived yesterday. The Charleston cap
tured Ladxone Islands, June 21. No re

and surrendered to me, having ex
hausted ammunition and food in repell
ing attacks by insurgents. Phe had cm
board fifty-two officers and ninety-four
men, naval' and military. DEWBT."
Adjutant General Corbin has received
the following, via Hongkong- July 3,
from General Anderson, who cora
maihded the first military expedition to
the Philippines:
"Cavalry, artillery and riding horses
desirable; can get limited . number
draught animals here.
"ANDERSON."
Every effort will be put forth by the
War- Department to get horses to Gen~
eral Anderson. The department has.
sent word to San Francisco to have
haste made in getting the expedition

received along the line from the moth

THE PARADE.
An Imposing Martial Pa
geant Passes Through
the Streets.
The parade was the most notable of Its
character that has ever passed through
the streets of San Francisco. The spirit
of war is in the air and has brought out
nil the patriotism and all the pride of
country of a united people.
As a pageant it was brilliant. The
massing of volunteer soldiers in this vi
cinity rnr'de possible a grand display.
The mounted troops Included the Fourth
Cavalry, with its mounted band; Utah
Iry, First Troop Cavalry, National
Guard of California and the signal corps.
The Infantry, marching with a steady
swing that told of the benefits conferred
by 'amp life, was composed of the Sixth
Seventh and Eighth California, First
Washington, Twentieth Kansas, First
Tennessee and Fifty-first lowa. The
hearts of the people who thronged the
streets went out to the men so far from
their homes. They were greeted with
s and the waving of flags through
out the long line of march. They were
made to feel that their self-sacrifice was
appreciated and that while within the
city's gates they were the adopted sons
of the people.
The reception accorded them was ex
tended also to the veterans of the Mexi
can War, who rode in carriages, and to
the veteran firenifn. The latter, despite
their yi.ai-s of service, sported their red
shirts and Bervice helmets and proudly
pulled their beloved old engines, relics
of the olden days.
The men of the Naval Reserve looked
like trained fighting men and witu the
League of the Cross Cadets aided in fill
ing out the brilliant picture .
One of the features of the procession
was in the sixth division, which was pre.
by a band and the drill corps of
Columbian Park Clubâ a body of
ty-flve youngsters in blue suits and
caps on the English artillery pattern.
This division was made up of the local
tri!,< s and councils of the Improved Or
der of Red Men. a fraternal organization
which is purely Am* rican, and based
upon the early Indian traditions of the
Vnited States.
The majority of the members of the or
der were attired In picturesque costumes,
buckskin and other stilts, war paint and
feathers, and they presented a very pic
turesque appearance, which was height
ened by three historical floats. Those In
line Rll along the route of march greeted
the spectators with loud warwhoops. and
these were responded to in kind by those
on the sidewalks who could imitate the
noises of the aborigines, while the ladles
who were unable to join in testified their

appreciation of the demonstration by the

Appropriate Speeches
and Music at Metro
politan Hall.
The literary exercises held at Metropol
tan Hall in the afternoon were attended
by fully 2500 people and many were un
able to gain entrance. The programme
was carried out in a manner that reflected
great credit on the committee and those
who participated.
After an overture of patriotic selections
by J. D. Hynes' orchestra. Grand Marshal
A. A. Borlini in a brief speech of thanks
for the honor conferred on him intro
! duced Joseph E. O'Donnell, president of
the day. President O'Donnell said that it
was with feelings of patriotic pride that
he assumed the position of president of
the celebration. He thanked the commit
tee of one hundred for the assistance giv
en him and then feelingly referred to the
California Volunteers who were celebrat
ing the birth of our country's independ
ence many thousand miles away.
"America," said he in conclusion, "has been
the rrecfci tor of the world in the lesson of
" mi. Toward the elQse uf the last century,
when yet but a crippled colony, its struggle
for fr.'"d..ni and the- glorious achievement of
its Independence astounded the world; and
now that it has sprung into tru- attitude oÂ£ 'a
proud republic, prosperous, limitless and in
vincible,' It will at the close of this century
teach another lesson to the world, as well as
Spain, that the day of arbitrary power is at
an end; that nations as well as individuals
must be subject to the dictates of humanityâ
a lesson which the immortal Edmund Burke
read to the English nation when, in his re
markable impeachment of Warren Hastings,
he said: 'The king has no arbitrary power to
give, your lordships have not, nor the Com
mons, nor the whole legislature, because ar
bitrary power Is a thing which neither any
man can hold nor any man can Rive."
"The God of Battles who watched over our
arms in every crisis of our country's history
and led our forces successfully through every
war on sea or land still looks with love on
that starry banner which has ever floated in
the holy cause of freedom."
Miss Daisy V. Keane sweetly sang "Co
lumbia." 'and being encored rendered "Our
Grand Old Flag," written by Mrs. E. I.
Bronson.
Mayor James D. Phelan was next called
upon for a few remarks. He said that
America is to-day pointing with pride to
the sons to whom she h;\* given birth. He
referred to the "glorious victories won by
our navy and army" in the present war
with Spain. "The decisive blow of the
war has been given." said he, "and Amer
ican courage and pluck have been vindi
cated. All honor to Dewey, Sampson,
Shaffer and all our heroes. Our American
vessels will now be able to ride at anchor
in safety in any port in the world."
W. W, Finnic sang "On to Spain," and
for an encore "Keep a Place in Your
Heart for Me."
After selections by the orchestra, Presi
dent O'Donnell introduced John j. Bar
rett, who was selected to deliver the ora
tion. He was frequently interrupted dur-
ingr the course of his remarks by bursts
cf applause. He spoke in part as follows:
What Is the mission of the American re
public? Have we understood it? Are we ful
filling it?
Its mission Is Intelligibly written in every
hour of its history. It is the child of battle
freedom. The mlnde, the hearts, the souls.
the life from which it drew its beirm wore
aflame with the love of freedom. Freedom
Was the predominant passion of Its pro
genitors. ItÃ very being Is but the embodi
ment of the triumphant assertion of the right
of freedom. Its youth was nursed at tho
breast of freedom. It developed into lusty
manhood through the vitalizing energy of the
spirit of freedom. Twice in the span of its
career It has been summoned to wrest from
obstinate despots at fearful cot-t the freedom
of enthralled and misgoverned peoples.
On every sod that our feet have pressed
and on every wave that our ship of state has
mounted, from '7S to '9K, from Trenton to
Manila, from Washington to Dewey. our com
mission has been plainly writtenâ the Ameri
can republic, the custodian of freedom; guard,
grow in, give freedom. â¢ â¢ â¢
We responded to the call of Cuba like a na
tion that was simply resting on its arm 3 wait-
Ing for the summons. The call for volunteers
transformed us into one vast army. The heart
Of every citizen Is mustered In. The amazing
spectacle is shown the world of millions of
men in angry contest for the privilege of
fighting in the cause. Our fields are tented
thick with as brave an army of patriots as
ever served a country. We have sent across
the seas as heroic an army of warriors as ever
enlisted in a righteous can. c. Down where
the angry waters lash the Cuban coastâ ln the
very waters where the coward dei-il that con
vulsed our nation was committed â the sub
limest feats uf valor in tho annals of the
world have been eclipsed by Hobson. We stand
in awe at the impressive valor of that young
lieutenant and his brave companions. It was a
deed of deathless fame. With pride and grati
tude we shall remember Hobson and the gal
lant crew of the Merrlmac as long as with
love and sorrow we remember the shattered
Maine. If ausht of harm befalls those darling
heroes the infamy will rankle in our hearts
Ion*? after we shall have avenged that other
outrage.
Down in the distant Orient the master feat
In the naval warfare of the world has been
wrought by an American seaman. We are
contemporaries of a man whose name will be
a household word as long as the human fam
ily shall be divided into warring sections. We
are fellow-citizens with a naval warrior whose
intrepidity and skill will be the pride and
boast of the American republic so long as the
nation shall endure. Â» â¢ â¢
The war in which we are engaged is
teaching other lessons. It has emphasized the
fact that patriotism Is the monopoly of no
creed; that in the welded union (if all the
classes, creeds and racea embraced in this re
public lieH the impregnable bulwark of Ameri
ca]] institutions; that the vilest traitor and
f. ulest foe of American principles is he who,
challenging the patriotism of any creed or of
any race, sows dissension among an otherwise
united, peaceful and invincible people. This
war has fused us into a thunderbolt, and the
nation that is crossing its course will feel its
mlpht.
Miss Helen Merrill of the Tivoll then
sang "The Star Spangled Banner" and
was deservedly encored. The Declaration
of Independence was read in masterly
manner by Julius Kahn, and the large au
dience dispersed after singing "America."
THE WOUNDED.
The Emergency Hospital
Doctors Busy Treating
Powder Burns.
Considering the cause for a more than
usual enthusiastic celebration of the day
it was no wonder that the Emergency
Hospital surgeons were kept busy reliev
ing the sufferings of patriots wounded
by powder explosions and excessive en
thusiasm.
The first case treated was that of David
: Barry, JU.O% Morris avenue. He was
; walking along Folsom street and at Sixth
â  a boy came out of a doorway and flred a
! toy pistol into his face, the bullet strik
; ing his upper lip and inflicting an ugly
wound.
William Mci onald, a boy living at 1217
: Howard street, was firing off a toy can
; non when it exploded in his right hand
; badly wounding it. His brothtr Fred
â¢ took possession of the cannon, but a pre
mature explosion burned his face badly
1 and he had also to seek help in the hos
pital.
Willie Kofi", 120 Converse street, allowed
his toy cannon to explode, in his left hand
! and the index finger was nearly severed.
Rudolph Anderson, 125 Locust avenue,
! had the fingers of his left hand badly
burned by the premature explosion of a
I toy cannon, and Willie Bolger, 8 Boyd
; street, and Joe Merk, 15 Brosnan street,
were burned about the face, hands and
I eyes by the premature explosion of lire
i crackers.
William Flynn, 317 Tehama street, was
fooang with a revolver when it exploded
and the bullet lodged in his left hand. It
was extracted by Dr. Rinne at the hos
pital.
E. G. Regholz, a member of Company
G, Washington Volunteers, stationed at
Angel Island, was the most seriously in
jured of the many brought in. A 44 flat
tened bullet was extracted from his left
side. The wounded volunteer stated that
he was walking down Larkin street with
lE. Harris and when he reached Geary
street he felt something strike him.
Placing his hand in his blouse he dis
covert il a lump and went into a near by
drug store to be examined. It was then
ascertained that he was wounded and he
went to the Receiving Hospital. The bul
let bore evidence of having struck some
thing hard and glancing off entered his
body.
John Walsh, living at 3 Walsh street,
visited the Southern station and com
plained of being stabbed By Matt Mul
cahey. who lives in the same house with
him. He was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where a slight knife wound was
found on him.
Martie Boyle, ll" 1^ Perry street, suf
fered a fracture of the jaw, due to the
explosion of a toy cannon.
Ed Doerers.asmall boy living at 208 Val
ley street, was treated for powder burns
about the hand. Elma Harr, 6 Grove
I street, was also treated for the same in
jury.
Willie Bolger, a small boy, looked over
a "rod bead" and had his eye damaged
by th" exploding noise-making article.
Walter Murdoch, 1009 Hayes street, had
powder removed from his optic.
M. E. McKinna, 9;>- Market street, fell
from a car and fractured his right leg
James Lynch, 4 Cleveland street, was
treatecl for powder burns about the face.
Nellie O'Donnell, 55S Stevenson street,
tried to set off a roman candle, with dire
[ results to her hand.
Lily Blume, a little girl, was treated for
! painful burns about the face, caused by a
roman candle.
Mrs. Martin of 944 Mission street was
relieved of painful powder burns about

ON THE FRONT. :
All Kinds of Vessels Gay
With Bunting in Honor
of the Occasion.
Never in the liistory of the water front
has the shipping made as brave a show
ing as it did yesterday. Efvery American
vessel In port had her hunting thrown to
the breeze and the Britishers also -deco
rated their vessels. On other- holidays
the captains of American vessels have al
ways excused the poor showing made by
their ships -by pointing' .to the fact that
they had no crews aboard, while all for
eign craft had a full complement of men
in the forecastle.
When an American Vessel reaches an
American port everybody is paid off and
the only people who remain by the .ship
as a rule are the captain, cook and stew
ard. '
On this occasion, however; if there were
no men in the forecastle to drefcs the
ship the captains or owners must have
hired them specially, as every American
vessel in the bay did honor to the glori
ous Fourth.
At the Mail dock the steamers Acapul
co, Peru, City of Panama and Coptic
made that end of the town look Kay with
bunting. The Coptic flew the British flag
from her gaff and the stars and stripes
from the fore. At Steuart-strcet wharf
the American ship Roanoke upheld the
honor of the day, while at Harrison
street wharf the steamers Pennsylvania
and Cleveland carried off the honors.
Folsom-street wharves had the British
steamer Bristol and American steamer
Centennial and the Spreckels tugs Reli
ance, Alert and Sea King to help make
them the brightest spots on the front.
Every flag that the' boys of the naval
battalion could get hold of was flown on
the training ship Marion, and thecutters
Grant and Rush were the best dressed
vessels in the bay.
The State tugs were covered with bunt
ing, and they and the ferry-boats were
gay with flags, while the steamer Point
Arena, schooner Transit and the bark
entine Irmgard made Mission-street.wharf
one blaze of color.
North of the ferries the steamer Ala
meda and the brig W. O. Irwin at Pacific
street wharf looked particularly well.
The steamers of the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company made their usual fine
showing at Broadway wharf, and the
bark Andrew Welch and steamer City of
Puebla were decked from stem to stern
at section 4 of the seawall. The British
barks Auldgirth at Green street and
West York at the seawall' helped out th<*
general effect. There was not a vessel
of any description, from a scow schooner
to an ocean liner, but what had her Hags
up and helped to make the occasion a
glorious one.
JOY WAS KING.
A Night of Tumult and
Noisy Patriotic Ex
pression.
Probably there was not another city In
the United States in which there wag
such a tumult of patriotic expression as
in San Francisco last evening. From dusk
until the hour of 12 there was a burst of
explosions. Firecrackers of every degree,
torpedoes which seemed to have tho
dynamic force sufficient to destroy a
navy, combined in a babel of sound so
constant that, heard from the surround
ing heights, it was an unbroken roar,
punctuated here and there by a heavier
boom when some cannon spoke.
Across the sky, lowering with fog, there
flashed thousands of rockets. Roman can
dles shot their bright lights into the air.
Fire of every hue lent splendor to the
night. From the top of the Spreckela
building there burned signal lights which
must have sent to a great distance infor
mation that the city was celebrating.
The sight was beautiful and inspiring.
Crowds were on all the thoroughfares
and they enjoyed the occasion to the ut
most. To be sure, crackers went off gust
under their feet, and a rain of sparks was
to be expected any minute, but nobody
seemed to object. People inclined to ob
ject must have remained at home. The
noise anywhere down town was simply
deafening. Conversation was carried on
with difficulty and in shouts. Men forgot
their dignity and ventured to shoot ag
gressive cartridges. Even the women
slyly dropped torpedoes, and laughed to
see the effect if anybody manifested
signs of being startled, deeming that they
had secured a triumph.
There had been some racket during the
day, but It was as nothing. The going
down of the sun' was the signal for pan
demonium. There was no rest nor peace,
but as nobody was in quest of these su
perfluities there \v;is no complaint. Until
midnight the clamor was una Dated, but
even then it did not entirely cease. There
was a comparative calm, but with all
their ardor people had been unable to
burn all their fireworks, and they kept on
burning. The roar died down, but there
was still a "boom, boom!" bespeaking a
time that some patriots were having. In
deed, the night had nearly passed before
silence reigned over the city.
A POOR DISPLAY.
Over 10.000 people who- went out to the
corner of Clayton and Haight streets to
witness the city's display of fireworks re
turned home disappointed. Their disap
pointment was not due to any fault on
the part of the committee having the af
fair in charge. The set pieces would not
go off in a satisfactory way and several
of them went out before they were haja
burned. The display of rockets and othflj
aerial pieces was the only satisfactory
part of the programme. There was nft
Cog, so the fizzle cannot be charged tÂ£
thai account.
Colonel T. P. Robinson, chairman of the
fireworks committee, said after the so
called display that he was as sorely dis
. nted a? those who traveled out to
see a pyrotechnic display. The excuse of
fered by the manufacturers for the fail
ure was that the set pieces got wet.
Fireworks at North Beach.
The patriotic members of the Golden
Gate Valley Improvement Club provided
a display of fireworks last night for the
residents on the North Beach side of the
city. The fireworks were displayed from
a barge on the lagoon at the foot of Fill
more street.
There were no sot nieces, rockets, bombs
and various colored tire making up the ex
hibition. The affair was under the direc
tion of the following members of the
club: Prank H. KL.*er, William Schaeffer,
Harper Wilkinson, Richard Rice, Mr.
Paul, Mr. Mangels and Mr. Creede. There
was a largo auendanoo. although a cold
wind and fog interfered with the show.

VIEWING THE PARADE.
THE people of San Francisco witnessed yester
day a parade which to many of them was unique.
The city is becoming accustomed to the sight
of soldiers, but never before had there been seen here
thousands, armed as for war, marching with banners
and drums, with all the precision and alignment of
veterans. A few weeks ago these volunteers ar
rived from different States widely separated, yet one
purpose among them all. For love of the common
flag they had left the pursuits of peace. That the
flag might wave unstained they had offered their lives.
They were undrilled, ununiformed. The parade
showed that there had been a transformation. The
boys marched with such military bearing that the
civilian looking on could not distinguish between the
seasoned regular and the untried volunteer.
There were other interesting features connected
with the parade, but every eye was for the soldiers.
To see them pass, regiment after regiment, was an
inspiriting spectacle, not wholly a mere show. There
must have been in the minds of those who watched
the thought that these soldiers were of the same blood
as the ones who died so bravely on the torrid heights
about Santiago, and that as willingly and blithely
would they, too, go to a grave in alien soil. It may
fall to them yet to face perils as appalling as Cuba has
offered, but everybody who watched them knows that
whatever betide, these boys will not shrink. The
nation is aroused to fighting pitch, and they repre
sent the nation. They are our people. We feel for
them the bond of kinship.
With victory crowning our arms by sea and land,
with each day producing a hero, each hour heavy
with fate, a parade in honor of the Fourtli could not
have been an ordinary event. But when we hear
the tramp of armed men, and the note of the bugle
which will soon call them to die; when the flag which
is the emblem of the Union floats over those who will
carry it afar to mark the advancing otitposts of civili
zation, emotions are ?tirre<l to their deeps, and love
of country thrills the American as the love of mother
and home.
THE ALASKAN TRADE.
THE arrival of the first company of Klondike
miners of the season at Seattle, bringing with
them several hundred thousand dollars' worth
of gold, will have the effect of recalling to the de
velopment of the rich resources of Alaska the public
attention, which of late has been distracted by the
war.
While it is by no means desirable that there should
be a renewal of the "Klondike craze," it will certainly
be of advantage to all parts of the Pacific Coast to
have full consideration given to the possibilities of
the country along the Yukon. We have there a
promising field for a remunerative industry and a
large commerce, and it is gratifying to learn from
the reports of the returning miners that the promise
is not likely to prove a deceptive one.
According to the statements made by the men who
have come straight from the gold fields the estimate
made by our correspondent, Sam W. Wall, that the
output of the Klondike for the season would be in
the neighborhood of $28,000,000, is correct. They
report comparatively few bonanza strikes, but that
the average output of the claims has been sufficiently
remunerative to make the further exploitation of the
region a safe venture for those who are strong, in
dustrious and enterprising. This gives a reasonable
assurance to the hopes of those who contemplate
undertaking the enterprise this year, and also con
firms the belief that in the gold fields we shall find
a market of increasing profit for our manufacturers
and merchants.
Whatsoever advances any portion of the Pacific
â  Coast is directly beneficial to California, the chief
center of the population of the coast, and to San
Francisco its commercial and financial metropolis.
In the development of the resources of the vast ter
ritory of Alaska lie some of the best possibilities of
our trade. This is the outfitting point for the people
who go to Alaska and the best depot of supplies for
the country. Our interests in the Yukon gold fields
are therefore great, and in more ways than one we
shall find a profit for ourselves in the gold dust and
nuggets the newly returned miners have brought with
them as a proof of the richness of the Klondike
placers.
There will be regret if Butcher Pando ever sur
renders. There might be no good military excuse
for executing him, and he needs killing almost as
badly as does Weyler. whose understudy he has been
in the profession of murder.
Blanco wanted Cervera bounced. Well, the gen
tleman has been bounced, and before long some
Yankee with a lot of guns and men will remark to
Blanco. "Next."
Linares is said to have a serious wound. If he
still clings to the idea that there is a ghost of a chance
for him, the injury must have affected his brain.
This is just the opportunity for Wcyler to say it
would not have happened if he had been there.
WHY A NATION IS NOT A BONK-
WITHOUT making any argument for our na
tional bank system in its present condition of
inadaptation to the credit and currency needs
of the people, we desire to present again the reasons
why the United States Treasury cannot serve the pur
poses of a bank of issue.
All paper currency is credit money, not primary
money of intrinsic value equal to its nominal value.
Nominal value means the value named, or printed or
stamped on its face.
All currency to have its nominal and actual value
the same must have an intrinsic value equal to its
nominal value, or must be redeemable at its nominal
value in something of the same intrinsic value. Now,
when the Government issues paper currency, unless
it is redeemable at its nominal value in something of
equal intrinsic value, it is subject to just the same
vicissitudes as like currency issued by an individual,
or by a corporation of individuals. Papers, notes,
bank checks, drafts, bills of exchange and letters of
credit are all of the same character. They are not
money. They are merely titles to money and pass
as commercial paper or currency at their nominal
value only as long as the taker is sure of the ability
of their maker to redeem them at their nominal value.
We hear it said often that behind the greenbacks is
the credit of the United States. That is true, but
the credit of the United States is subject to the same
fluctuations and vicissitudes as the credit of an indi
vidual. The United States has no means of get
ting money except by taxation of the people. The
United States has only this power of taxation as a
means of keeping its credit good. When taxation
does not yield money enough to pay its current ex
penses and redeem its outstanding promises to pay, in
greenbacks and other forms of demand obligations, its
credit is in danger and can be maintained only by
borrowing money on bonds, or bonded obligations.
These bear a stated rate of interest, and are due at
a fixed time in the future. As their maturity ap
proaches the United States provides for their pay
ment by laying taxes on the people to meet them
when due.
Here, now, we have the difference between the
United States' promise to pay a greenback on de
mand and its promise to pay a bond at maturity.
The greenback is due at any time. The bond is
due at one time only. Under the law the green
back when redeemed has to be immediately reissued.
Under the law the bond when redeemed is destroyed.
Therefore, whenever a greenback is redeemed the
credit of the United States is weakened. When
ever a bond is redeemed the credit of the United
States is strengthened.
Now, as the value of paper currency depends upon
its redemption at its nominal value in intrinsic value,
I if the United State 6 engage in business as a bank
' of issue of such paper currency, it must have on hand
j all the time sufficient money of intrinsic value to
' redeem on demand its paper at its nominal value.
It is entirely possible that the whole sum of $.346,
000,000 outstanding greenbacks, due on demand, may
be presented in one day to the treasury for redemp
tion. The treasury is just now in unusually good
condition, having on hand a gold reserve of $166,
000.000. for such redemption purpose. But it might
pay that all out and fail for $180,000,000!
What then? Some of our political leaders would
say "Redeem in silver dollars." The moment that
was done the silver dollar would appear at its in
trinsic value, 50 per cent below its nominal value, and
gold, or money of equal nominal and intrinsic value,
would disappear.
Suppose, now, that there are no greenbacks or
demand obligations on the United States outstand
ing. If its obligations are all time obligations, due
at different fixed periods, so that the taxing power
can be operated to provide for their redemption, they
will not only be always at par, but usually at a prem
ium. This will be because of the certainty of pro
vision for their redemption at maturity by taxation
and because of their safety and convenience for use
as collateral in raising ready money, and the ever
present ability to sell them for actual money at their
face value, and usually at a premium.
Now if the law authorize a corporation to buy
$100,000 worth of such time bonds, deposit them in
the treasury and receive in return $90,000 in bank
I notes to enter into circulation by being loaned as
1 bank capital, it will be seen that 90 per cent of the
I national bonds may be represented in circulation by
! paper currency, and that if such a corporation fail the
! bonds deposited by it in the treasury are simply can
; celed and the $00,000 in notes are redeemed by the
| treasury at their face on presentation and the treasury
I has wiped out $100,000 of its bonded debt, has $10,000
I left on hand to pay its expenses in the transaction, and
' the noteholders of the broken bank have not lost a
; penny. The notes were worth their face before
the bank failed. They were worth the same after,
: and the only losers would be the stockholders of the
banking corporation, who lose their original invest
i ment of $100,000 in United States bonds which se
j cured their circulation and made their noteholders
i safe.
The difference between basing a Mnk of issue on
national time bonds, sure of payment at maturity, and
using the treasury as a bank of issue, will be seen to
lie in the necessity of all sound issue banking; that it
shall be founded on a form of security that is imme
diately convertible into money which has an equal
and nominal and actual value.
When such money has to be raised by taxation
the slow process and uncertainty of the amount that
may be demanded by the noteholders make it impos
sible to keep an exact amount on Tiand for such
purpose. It ties up money in the treasury that ought
to be in circulation and keeps the public credit in
continual jeopardy.
The other process ties up no money, withholds
none from circulation, but secondarily converts the
national bonds into currency. It would seem that
a perfected system, expanded to the credit and cur
rency needs of the country and based upon public
securities, is preferable to the uncertainties and known
insufficiency of a direct treasury issue.
Doubtless the war correspondent is a brave man,
but he should let the reader take this for granted.
People want to know how the tide of battle raged.
They are not pining to learn from the correspondent
all his personal acts, and receive an analysis of his
emotions. The reporter at a fight ought to remem
ber that he is not the fight. So that his account be
accurate and vivid, his individuality cuts no figure,
and when he projects it into every situation he creates
the impression that he has a case of ttiat malady vul
garly known as swelled head.
Nobody will deny that the Spanish fought bravely.
They did the best they knew, and they died with an
enthusiastic energy. It is too bad that to people of
such courage there has been denied the gift of com
mon sense.
There are evidences that Correspondent Creelman
has been wounded. He does not send the report
himself, or it would naturally be regarded with sus
picion.
That some miners should have arrived from Alaska
with gold and full stomachs is a refreshing change.
THE SAX FRAXCTSCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 5, 1898.
CAMERA'S FLEET NEXT.
SAMPSON'S destruction of the Spanish fleet at
Santiago, which served to infuse the Fourth
of July with the glow of present victory as well
as past glory, not only leaves us free to prosecute the
campaign in Cuba at whatever point we please, but
allows us to send at once a fleet to Europe to operate
off the coast of Spain and another to seek out the
flying squadron of Camara and destroy it wherever
found.
The extraordinary character of the victories
achieved over the fleets of Spain at Manila and at
Santiago leaves not the least doubt as to the result
that will follow the meeting of an American squadron
with that of Camara. At Manila not a single man
was lost during the action, and at Santiago only one,
while the losses of the Spanish were terrific. It is
clear that the Spaniards, however brave and patriotic
they may be, are incapable of handling the mechanism
of modern naval armaments. They were able to buy
battle-ships and cruisers with big guns from the
British, the French and the Germans, but they have
not been able to handle them with any effect what
ever. In both contests our gunners have battered
the Spanish ships to pieces with as much safety to
themselves as if they had been engaged in target
practice.
Under these circumstances the much debated ques
tion whether Camara's fleet is making its way toward
the Philippines with the intention of attacking Dewey
will not be seriously considered any longer. To
fight an American fleet is perhaps the last thing Ca
mara thinks of doing. He may probably direct his
course to the islands, but if so it will not be with
the intention of confronting Dewey. There will
doubtless be a repetition of the tactics of Cervera.
The Spanish fleet will cruise and dodge about in the
archipelago as long as possible, and when out of
coal, or when closely pursued, will take refuge in
some fortified harbor and wait the inevitable end.
There is a chance, however, that as soon as Ca
mara receives the news of the defeat of Cervera he
will hasten back to Spain as rapidly as possible.
There are good reasons for believing that his fleet
was dispatched toward the Orient only for the pur
pose of deluding the Spanish people into the belief
that the Ministry is prosecuting the war vigorously
and intends to recover the Philippines. The move
ment, in fact, is more likely to have been one of
politics than of naval strategy, and in the present
emergency it may appear to the bewildered Cabinet
at Madrid that it would be better politics to bring it
home than permit it to continue its way to the East.
Whatever course the Spaniards may pursue there
will be no question as to ours. From this time on
our fleets will seek Camara wherever he may go. A
fame like that which has been won by Dewey in de
feating Montijo and by Sampson in defeating Cer
vera is to be gained by the fortunate commander who
overtakes Camara, and it is scarcely necessary to say
he must steam far and fast if he escapes the Ameri
can fleets that will soon be on his trail and moving
as rapidly as their engines can drive them.
PATRIOTS fIND THE RED CROSS.
WHILE the nation has been stirred to fervor,
and has freely given its sons to battle, glory
ing in their triumphs, and weeping proudly
when some have fallen, the womtn have been as
keenly patriotic as the men. They could not take
up arms, but they could send their sons and brothers
forth. And in the unselfish intensity of their awak
ened emotions, every boy wearing the garb of a sol
dier became as a son or a brother. Faithfully and
lovingly have they worked for his comfort. They
have fed and clothed and sheltered him when the
Government he served had been slow in providing.
They have given him comforts and delicacies, medi
cines, bandages. They have cared for the sick. They
have proved to the soldier that he has a place in the
common affection, cheering him and sustaining him.
If they could they would go to the front to nurse him
on the field of battle.
The women of this State have been particularly
active, for here the soldiers have gathered by thou
sands, and from here they have started over sea. In
all the regiments gone there is not a soldier who
does not remember with gratitude the kindly, unos
tentatious ministration of the gentle women. To
accomplish its great work the Red Cross has re
quired large sums. Money has been freely given.
For the most part, people have been so anxious to
give that the offerings poured in unsolicited. To
have to record that there are exceptions, that some
hearts have not been touched, that in some breasts
there is no impulse of patriotism, is not pleasing.
Among others, the saloonkeepers of the city started
a fund for the benefit of the Red Cross. The pro
moters believed that not one of the fraternity would
withhold a contribution. They were disappointed.
An instance was when they sent to "Pop" Sullivan a
blank for the recording of subscriptions. Sullivan
runs a large place on Market street. Where a smaller
dealer might afford to donate a dollar, he could easily
afford a hundred. Yet he did not give a cent. The
blank was returned to the committee, as blank as
when it reached Sullivan's hands. Such an act was
a slight and a slur. Worse even than this was the
response of Frank Garcia of Montgomery street, who
to his declination added a ribald insult, aimed at
the organization, but only serving to show his own
character.
The women of the United States believe in the
flag. In such way as is possible they -esent an af
front to it. When France expressed hostility they
said they would do no more purchasing in the marts
of Paris. Already France feels the withdrawal of
their patronage, and vainly laments. When a sa
loonkeeper assumes an attitude as unfriendly as that
of France, the women are powerless to similarly re
sent it. Sullivan probably did not think that from
a business point of view he was making a mistake, but
he was and it will probably cost him more than a
trifle. There are men who are doing all they can
to help the Red Cross, and who, aware of the course
of Sullivan, will accept the rebuff as personal to them
selves. They will keep away from a place so un-
American. They have no tolerance for the sort of
citizenship that declines to aid a cause so worthy, and
so dear to patriots.
But perhaps there is some excuse for Sullivan. A
man whom the Government recently compelled to
pay an annoying fine of $700 may have had his en
thusiasm for Uncle Sam quenched by the process.
Still, it is not fair that he should hold the Red Cross
responsible. The ladies of this organization have
nothing to do with the regulations concerning the
rectifying of liquors.
The indications that General Miles sought to throw
cold water on the achievement of Shafter's army are
not pleasing to contemplate. Surely if the com
manding general of the army does not like the way
things are going at the front the President would
not deny him the privilege of getting there himself.
Soldiers who desert from the army just now will
find that in war times military authority views such an
act with disfavor.
Chile needn't sell her old O'Higgins. We don't
have any use for it.
A CANADIAN POSTAL CARD.
The accompanying illustration is a reproduction of a postal card, printed in
colors, sent by William Bell of Winnipeg to Wilbur Tibbils. On the back was
the message, "How is this for a Canuck postal card?"
IN ACTION.
When the blue-Mack waves are tipped -with
white, and the balmy trade winds blow.
When the palm-crowned coast In the offing
lies, with sands like the driven snow.
When the mighty hulls of the battleshipsâ the
nation's strength and prideâ
And the ghost-like little torpedo boats are
lying side by side;
When all is still pave the streaming gulls, as
they circle high o'erhead.
When naught is heard on th.> steel-bound decks
â ava the watcher" a measured tread.
When far to windward a tiny cluud floats up
from the grim old fort,
Then the piercing scream of a shrapnel shot,
anj the ten-ton gun's report.
Then armored decks are nllve with life, and
the calls to quarters blow:
Then the gun crews stand beside their guns
and the stokers sweat below;
Then the jingling bells in the engine room
clamor and call for speed.
And the thousand tons of hardened steel shake
like a wind-tossed reed.
Now the puns of the fort aro> belching- flame,
and the shot and shell fall fast,
Now three are down by the forward run, and
six in the fighting mast;
Now the ships rush on in majesty while the
gunners hold their breath
And pray to their (". Â»1 t" ?i are them still
from the harbor's hidden death.
Now a string of fluttering signal flags from
the bridge of the (lac-ship fly.
Now the Catlings, rapids and twelve-Inch guns
with a crashing peal reply;
Now the smoke hangs low o'er the shot-torn
wave, dark death lurks in the air.
And never a word by the guns is said, while
they spit and boom and flare.

THE BOY IN BLUE.
A Tribute from a R"d Coat.
Under the trees of beautiful Golden
Gate Park, characteristic of your unique
energy, I watched the future conquerors
of Spain going through the complicated
movements of company drill. To me,
as an Englishman, there was something
particularly refreshing in the easy gait,
the alertness and surprising good nature
with which these lads, recruits of only
a few weeks' standing, performed the
intricate evolutions. I passed and re
passed the squads and companies which
are, in reality, but raw material, and
wondered, as the world is wondering, at
this display of singie-s.juled patriotism â
the life strings of a nation's heartâ for
what? Not in retaliation for a diplo
matic blunder of an underling of Spain
nor yet in revenge for the dastardly act
that engulfed the Maim and her gallant
crew in the v.-aters of Havana harbor.
No; but as a great and generous naiion's
response to tne far-off despairing cry of
a down-trodden people, gripped in the
iron hand of a tyrant who grips to the
death.
Such thoughts as these filled me as I
left the sunlit terraces to where Inviting
shade promised rest and reflection. I
came across one of "our boys," an af
fectionate cognomen which has more of
honest love than any other title his merit
has gained him. Let It always be so,
"Our Boys." It savors so much of a
mother's love, a father's pride.
Whether from ranch or workshop, office
stool or college hall, to me it mattered
not. The man of the hour was before
me; let that suffice. ,He has become
a personality, of which every detail is
known, every action noted, and it ap
pears presumption in me to endeavor to
make a faint sketch of the man which
the whole of America, ay! and for that
the Anglo-Saxon race speaks of with
pride and dubs in admiration "The Boy
in Blue." He had watched me cross
ing the green sward and I opine natural
ly understood my motive, and conse
quently we met as strangers do in like
circumstances, with a shy nervousness of
each other. He had taken off his felt
hat, identical with that worn by the
troopers in Australia and South Africa,
and arranged the narrow slip that does
duty as a band which truthfully needed
no arranging, while I found a sulphur
match is not one of the best means of
lighting a cigarette. But soon our mu
tual reserve wore off and we talked long
and earnestly of many things. It is
not meet I set down here of what our
conversation consisted, except to say he
destroyed none of my happiest opinions.
There may have been a boyish enthu
siasm of the glory and panoply of war, a
love of adventure, but underlying it all,
deep and strong, the true nature of a
real man was apparent, firm in purpose
and indomitability of will.
So we shook hands and parted; he go
lug his way, I mine. I watched him
long and earnestly as he threaded his way
through the throngs of people campwaro".
si* feet ol stalwart manhood, sound of
limbs, upright in â  bearing, clean in
thought, cherishing above aught else the
flag which his national courage and
strong arm will uphold always. Happy
the nation that produces such a son, and
happy the son that fights for such a
lias?
Good-by, then, my "boy in blue." We'll
meet never again, but I'll cherish ever
this slight memory of you and when
shcuts of joy go up from a people's heart
for a victory gained, or a nation. pride
rejoices in brave deeds accomplished, I 11
remember an afternoon in the Golden
V, est and you.
"To keep his flag a flying he's a doing and
a dying;
Every inch of him a soldier and a man."

OUB CUBAN ALLIES.
We are now getting pome practical ex
perience of the effectiveness of our Cu
ban allies â the people we went to war for.
Upon the whole, they present an agree
able surprise. We were prepared to find
them untrained and undisciplined, and so
they are to the lamentable extent of
handling rifles in a manner dangerous to
the lives of their American friends and
tilling the ground full of holes.
On the other hand, the Cubans seem
fully sensible of -what we are doing for
them, are amenable to discipline, eager
to fight, sufficiently brave, and have such
a whole-souled hatred for the Spanish as
to compensate for the many lacking quali
ties of the ideal soldier. It must be re
membered, too, that for the first time in
years these refugees are now properly fed
and thoroughly equipped.
Taking all this into consideration, there
seems a good prospect That in fighting
side by side, or at least, in harmony and
sympathy, with steady, well seasoned
troops and with a knowledge that power
and wealth are at last actually behind
them, the insurgent force may prove to
be a very valuable adjunct to our con
quest of Cuba.â New York Herald.
PROMOTION IN THE NAY*.
The advance of seven officers in Dewey's
squadron as a reward for their gallant
services at Manila has given rise to un
favorable criticism by the friends of offi
cers who have been jumped, and the most
decided objection is made to the advance
ment of Captain N. M. Dyer of the Balti
more over the head of Captain Charles I>.
Sigsbee, late of the battleship Maine. It
is argued that it would be better to wait
until after the war has ended to reward
officers who have distinguished themselves
and that it is unfair to those who through
no fault of their own have had no oppor
tunity to render conspicuous services to
be jumped. This argument is not likely
to have any weight with the administra
tion, for in advancing officers as a reward
for services in time of war it follows the
customs of all naval powers and to wait
until the war terminates would enable a
certain class of politicians and wire pull
ers to defer recognition for bravery to
perhaps the extent of indefinite postpone
ment.
Captain Grid Icy having died, Sigsbee is
still number 35 on the list and however
meritorious Captain Sigsbee's conduct was
after the loss of his ship it should not
debar Captain Dyer's advancement for his
skillful lighting at Manila. As for Cap
tain Coghlan, his original place was next
below Frank Wildes, but he had the mis
fortune to insult a Navy Department clerk
in lS7t>, for which offense ho was suspend
ed for one year and lost fourteen num
bers.
< 'aptain Sigsbee has been in rather hard
luck since he became an active member
of ihe navy, and this the latest jump over
his head is particularly aggravating to
Sigsbte's friends on account of Captain
Dyer being only a volunteer officer taken
into the regular navy in I!>tjÃ for his gal
lant record of three years in the war of
the rebellion. Slgsbee, Glass and :
have been trying for the past twenty-nine
years to convince Congress that they were
unjustly treated in the matter of standing
in the Navy Register, but without suc
ceeding in getting back to the positions !
claimed. Sands and Sigsbeo- entered the j
Naval Academy in November and Sep- I
tember, 1859; Evans, Glass and Coghlan |
entered in September, ISCO. The war had \
been going on for a couple of years before
these young men were detached from the
Naval Academy and entered on active ser
vice. Gia.sK headed the first class of I860;
Coghlan stood number 17 and Sands was
number 20. Siysbee was number 11 and
Evans number 21 in the second class.
Alter the second attack tin Fort Fisher,
in which Evans, Sands and Slgsbee par
ticipated, and in which the first named
w;ts Beverely wounded, the Navy Depart
ment advanced Evans and another officer,
George W. Coffin, now on the retired list,
forty-one numbers, which brought Evans
from six numbers below Sigsbee to thirty
four above him. It has never been as-
Berted that either Robley D. Evans or
Coffin acted with greater gallantry than
Sands or Sigsbee, and the fact that the
two former were wounded while the lattei
escaped unscathed had probably some
thing to do with the promotion of Evans
;:iid ( 'uffln.
Boards of admirals and committees ot
the Senate and House recommended re
peatedly that the e,Heged wrong done to
Glass, Sands and Slgsbee be remedied, but
for some reason not made known the
cases were not adjusted, and now as a
crowning disappointment a "mustang"
officer jumps a regular Naval Academy
gradua: c.
For many years after the close of the
war Congress was Importuned to rectify
alleged mistakes made In jumping officer's
over the heads of others in 1564, 1565 and
lSf,6. Only sixteen out of forty-four com
plaints were favorably acted on and they
wore nearly all of higher grade officers.
No acrimony was caused by the rapid
promotion of David D. Porter, who was a
lieutenant in IS6I and vice admiral in 1566.
Neither did the promotion of Rowan, Rod
gers, Wlnslow and Worden create any
criticism. The gallant W. B. Cushing was
advanced about fifty numbers and de
servedly so. On the other hand gallant

Resolved, We tender to the women of the West our heartfelt
thanks for their overwhelming kindness to our loved volunteers, and
assure them that the hearts of the Tennessee women bear a tender
feeling of gratitude toward their sisters of the West. May God show

THE EIGHTH CALIFORNIA.
Victory at Santiago Celebrated
in Camp BarrettâOrganiza
tion of a Band.
CAMP BARRETT. FRUITVALE, July
4.â The news from Shafter and Sampson
coming as it did on the anniversary of
the nation's independence, was sufficient
to stop all routine duty not absolutely
necessary to the welfare of the men and
th.-> camp, and with the exception of the
detachment under Major Whltton that
participated In the big parade through
Oakland to-day the boys had nothing to
do. The officers relaxed the rigid rules
governing the camp for the day and all
who cared were granted liberty to wit
ness the display.
The boys in Company B burned up ?25
M. Phillips of San Jose sent to Major
Whit ton with instructions to have the
members of the company use it to-day to
celebrate the victory at Santiago.
Major Whitum selected companies F
and G. formerly of the Fifth, and M and
A of the old Second for the parade, tak
ing the best equipped men 01' each and
bringing them up to eighty-four men
each by drawing upon the other com
panies. This made a battalion of 360 men,
and it presented a fine appearance. The
Callfornians compared most favorably
with i heir comrades from beyond the
Rookie* in stature and drill. When the
entire regiment is equipped and the men
have been in the service as long- as the
Easterners they will be an honor to the
Si.it'- and fully justify Governor Budd's
assertion that the Eighth would be the
crack regiment of the Statr.
Major WMtton led the battalion on a
magnificent black horse presented to him
by his friends in San Jose and shipped up
last niKht. Major Whitton is the envy of
ther officers, for, with the exception
of Lieutenant Heller, he is the only one
provided with a mount so far.
inel Henshaw called an officers'
Bchool this morning and discussed mat
!â¢ ra pertaining to camp routine and out
lined a thorough course of Instruction for
every member of the regiment that will
begin to-morrow morning.
Major Forbes returned from C'hico to
port was admirable. H. Percy Meld on,
made up as General Fitzhugh Lee, upheld
the dignity of the commanding offlci : ,
Major General H. P.. Stanburg, ami Lan
ders Stevens as Brigade Surgeon Fielding,
and Max yon Mltzel, as the Confederate
spy, were excellent. Leslie Morosco had
b i ongenial part as the special war artist,
and Fred J. Butler, who has the special
direction of the play, made a hit as Ru
fup, one of the faithful. Bert Morrison,
after an absence of several weeks, made
his reappearance as Lieutenant Colonel
Mr Pherson, and was well received. I^o
rena Atwood distinguished herself as
Rachel McCreery, playing the part with
rare grace and skill, and Maud Edna Hall
gave an evidence of her versatility as the
Ingenue, Susan McCreery. Julia Blanc as
the aunt, Euphinia McCreery, a maiden
lady of the South, was very effective. The
piece is well staged and will he a good
drawing card.

In i- of the Tivoll, played the role of the
Irish corpora! and he made a decided suc
cess of the part. He was neither forward
nor retiring-, but struck the happy medi
um, which chimed in with the other char
and rounded out the whole.
Theodore Robarts, who last week
played the part of Crow Knife, the In
dian, on this occasion assumed the part
of the drunken husband, and while the
part is not as exacting as the one he took
in the "Heart of Maryland," still he made
all there was to be made out of it. The
part Of the Indian was taken by John T.
Burke. The play has been Improved over
last week's presentation. Quicker action
iv;is noticeable in many of the scenes,
and in consequence better results were
secured. All the principal characters were
up to the high standard they set last
week and the play was received with as
much enthusiasm as upon its initial per
form:; :
After the first act a large American flag
was let down over the drop curtain and
the band played the "Star-spangled Ban
ner," while the audience rose to Its feet
and cheered and cheered again. In re
sponse to cries the band had to play
â 'Yankee Doodle," "Marching Through
Georgia" and finally "America." "Fort
Frayne" will be repeated every evening
this week.
The Tivoli.
The revival of "The Mika-do" at the
Tivoli last night received a very hearty
welcome, as did also the two old favor
ites. Elvia Crox Seabrooke and William
11. Wast, who have returned to this popu
lar bouse. Notwithstanding the many at
tractions outside and the excitement on
the stn -fts, n nulling from the glorious
war news, there was a fine audience and
It was well entertained. The jolly Japan

oi casion was decidedly meritorious, par
ticularly the second act, the special gems

Edwin Stevens was at his best and cap

"Tit Willow." he was recalled until he
was too breathless to sing longer. His
comedy work and odd Japanese acro
batics were equally good.
Miss Seabrooke's singing and acting

MINGLED JOY AND SORROW
Soldiers Happy at the Victory,
but Regret the Loss of So
Many of America's Sons.
The Fourth of July passed off very
quietly at Camp Merritt yesterday.
There waa a general but quiet rejoicing
among the men and officers over the suc
cess of the American navy. Many were
the expressions of sorrow to be heard
among the officers when they read in The
("alls list of the killed the name of some
friend or comrade. Especially was this
the case with the regulars, for many of
the officers here were personally ac
quainted with the country's heroes who
fÂ«-ll before Santiago. Second Lieutenant
Edmund Nathaniel Benchley, Company
E, Sixth Infantry, who was among the
killed, was a member of the '9S class, just
graduated from Weal Point. Among his
mates here at present arc Lieuten
ant Golin, Fourteenth Infantry; Lieuten
ant Munton, Twenty-third Infantry, and
Lieutenant Burner, Third Artillery.
These Officers were greatly grieved at the
news of the death of their old classmate,
whom they spoke of in the very highest
terms of praise.
The commands that participated in the
big parade left < amp at about 8 o'clock.
They were the Seventh California, Twen
ti. til Kansas, First Tennessee and Fifty
nrst lowa regiments. These regiments
assembled on Point Lobos avenue at 7;30
o'clock and, according to orders, their re
spective colonels reported to Brigadier
General H. G. Otis. The regiments wer.
headed by their bands. General Otis and
i decidedly amusing. The make-up of
' Louise Royce as Katisha, the ugly spln
. ster, more than filled I the requirements,
being sufficient to drive the average man
Ito suicide or strong drink. She acted the
I part very acceptably, and ably added to
j the agony of Ko-Ko when the time for
j the marriage sacrifice came. Phil Bran
: son as the Mikado fitted his part well and
earned plenty of encores. NanW-Poo â
Arthur Boyc< â mad.- a fair minstrel, but
might show a little more interest in his
| work with benefit. The solos and choruses
; took tiie house and the interpolated local
; hits were pointed and appreciated.
The stage settings are very pretty, and
! the costumes rich. "The Mikado" should
I have a successful week's run.
The Alcazar.
The opening night of the second week
of Lewis Morrison as Frederick The
Great was distinguished by even a larger
attendance than was noted on the first
j night of the presentation of this charm
â  ing comedy-dramaâ a play which affords
j free scope for the actor's versatility.
, There is such a delightful mingling of the
serious with the light and playful, that
the piece will be lastingly popular. Its
changing mooua, its rapid transitions
| from light to shadow and from shadow to
! light again are faithfully represented by
j the genius of the sterling actor, who by
i the way does not appear to grow any
oider than ho was thirty years ago when
he trod the boards at the old California
j with Booth, Barrett and MeCullough.
] "Frederick The Great" will be kepi on
i the boards during the remainder of the
week.
The Orpheum.
The new bill at the Orpheum served to
| pack that house to standing room only.
Mis. Alice Shaw, whose talents as a whis
j tier have made her known the world over,
scored a hit. She is to her line of work
| what Jenny Lind was to song. She is ac-
I companied by her two daughters, whom
sho has trained excellently as support.
' The trio gave a refined and pleasing en- j
I tertainment. Douglass and Ford, novelty
dancers, devote their attention to "coon"
i songs and dances and do a very neat and
clever turn. The four Cohans in "Run
ning for Office" are as big a hit as ever.
| This is the last week of their engagement
lat the Orpheum. Charles Wayne did a
j funny thing as the Spanish Admiral who
[ turned all his ships over to the orchestra
iat the sound of thrÂ» first gun. Anna Cald
well, Falke and Semons. the three Watson
Sisters and Zamora, the two Judges and
Jones, Grant and Jonos all contributed to
j an excellent bill.
The California.
"Uncle Tom's Cabin." at the California,
has not lost Interest, and considering the
circumstances Is doing quite well. The
play is running smoothly and a good per
formance is the result. Edith Hall's
Topsy is an artistic piece of work, and
the singing of Uncle Tomâ Rhys Thomas
â makes an unusually pleasing feature of
this part. The bin goes all the week.
Olympia Music Hall.
The Olympia Music Hall attracted a
good house by Its bill, including Tom
Ryan, "the mad musician," who provoked
no end of fun by his eccentric genius;
Murry and Reynolds, character change
artists, do as neat a turn as is to be. seen
anywhere, while Maude Rockwell, who
sang for the first time in this city Sousa's
celebrated march, "The Stars and Stripes
Forever," was cheered to the echo. The
biograph has new war scenes.
At the Chutes.
A splendid display of fireworks was pro
vided by the management of the Chutes
for the thousands of people who crowded
the spacious grounds. There were bombs,
rockets and Bet pieces galore, the prettiest
effects, perhaps, of the whole display be
ing formed by a number of batteries ar
staff, with Captain Caine's troop of Utah
Cavalry as an escort, headed the forces
as they marched away. The regiments
returned in the afternoon with both offi
cers and men much fatigued from their
march. The men were given their free
dom until 11 o'clock last night. Very few
people visited the camp yesterday.
Major General Otis visited the camp in
the afternoon. It was reported that he
had issued orders assigning the expedi
tion to Manila, but this was denied at
his headquarters. The order, however,
will probably be issued some time to-day.
By order from the War Department
Private Mc.Mahon, Company M, Eight
eenth United States Infantry, was ar
rested as a deserter. He is charged with
di sertion in lSi>s from the Tenth Infantry.
MeMahon will be removed to the Presidio
pending his trial by a court-martial.
A sergeant in the Twentieth Kansas
was arrested and placed in the guard
house for firing off a loaded pistol in
camp.
Captain T. J. Shea, who has been chief
clerk to Chief Quartermaster de Voll, has
been transferee to the commissary de
partment under Major C. S. Boots.
Delbert Whiting of the Utah Cavalry
was thrown from his horse yesterday at
the corner of First and Point Lobos ave
nues and badly bruised. He was cared
for by the field hospital corps.
ijV. " W. S. H. Mathews haa been de
tached from the Fifty-first lowa and as
signed to duty as sanitary inspector of
Camp Morritt. Dr. Mathews, who has
established a wide reputation as an expert
in sanitation, has gone hard to work at
his new duties and it is hoped that Camp
Merritt will be relieved of some of its
multitudinous smells.
COLONEL LITTLE RESIGNS.
The Twentieth Kansas Regi
ment Loses Its Popular Offi-
ccr â Promotions.
It is stated at Camp Merritt, and upon
most excellent authority, that Lieutenant
Colonel Little, Twentieth Kansas, has
tendered his resignation to the War De
partment.
Lieutenant Colonel Little came out to
this coast as acting colonel in command
of the Kansas Regiment. Three weeks
ago Colonel Funston arrived, and Lieu
tenant Colonel Little was reduced to the
subordinate rank.
Colonel Funston immediately set up
radical changes in the administration of
regimental affairs, with the result that he
Boon had his command in as exrollent a
shape, from the military standpoint of
discipline and drill, as any of the troops
thai have come to the coast. The change
from the activity of his previous position
to the humdrum of a lieutenant colonelcy
was too much for Colonel Little, and two
weekfl ago he was taken seriously ill, and
removed to the Waldeck Sanitarium,
where he now Is.
Lieutenant Colonel Little assigns chronic
physical disqualification as his reason for
resignation.
If Lieutenant Colonel Little's resigna
tion be accepted, a number of popular
promotions will be In order. Senior Major
Frank H. Whitman will in all probability
move to Little's quarters; Junior Major
Metcalf will ascend in rank, will Senior
Captain Buchan.
MILITARY MEN ARE HAPPY
The Glorious News From the
Seat of War Is the Cause
of Great Rejoicing.
At military headquarters in the Phelan
building there was very little business
transacted yesterday, and what was done
was of no great importance. The glorious
news from Santiago occupied everybody's
attention, and all the officers were in a
very joyful mood. At an early hour in
the afternoon they quit business for the
day, locking their offices, and proceeded
to observe the national holiday each in his
own way.
The victory of Shafter, the annihilation
of Spain's fleet, and the inevitable fall of
Santiago, which is expected to-day, make
a combination of circumstances which in
the opinion of thoughtful military officers
now in San Francisco, entirely changes
the situation, and all within three days, so
that it now ni-oms almost unnecessary to
send any more troops to Manila. At any
r;iti\ very slew progress has been made
since last Friday in the formation of the
fleet for the fourth Manila expedition, and
ranged around the lake. A set piece rep
resenting the storming of Morro Castle
created great enthusiasm among the au
dience. One section represented a battle
ship and the other the castle. When both
were fully ablaze the warship discharged
a fusillade of shot and shell upon the cas
tle until It finally fell, and In its place ap
peared an American flag standing bright
and clear above the smoking ruins.
OAKLAND CANOE CLUB.
C. L. Taylor's Nereid Wins the Race
for the Holiday Cup.
The Oakland Canoe Club entertained Its
friends yesterday from 10:30 in the niorn-
Jng till the last car at night. Commo
dore Philip Caduc kept open house on his
handsome sloop Annie; Vice-Commodore
H. G. Hinckley took several parties nut
in bis gasoline launch Belvidere, and Sec
retary Charles Stewart was untiring in
hJs efforts to make things pleasant for
the club's guests.
Messrs. Stewart and Bowen's new sloop
Beatrice went into commission yesterday
and many of the visitors enjoyed a pleas
ant cruise In the creek, the breeze being
fair.
In the afternoon the canoe race for the
Holiday cup was held. The three boats
entered finished in this order: C. L. Tay
lor's Nereid first, Clyde Carman's Gipsy
second and Howard Byxbee's Whim third.
A swimming race, 150 yards with a turn,
resulted as follows: C. L. Taylor first,
Clyde Carman second, and Howard Byx
bee third. The same three then took tubs
and a paddle apiece, but C. L. Taylor fell
out of his craft before he had gone twen
ty yards. Carman and Byxbee rounded
the'stakeboat, but did not finish.
The headquarters of the club are on
Sessions Basin, East Oakland, and In
clude a boathouse, dressing room with
lockers and clubroom. After the sports
refreshments were served and in the even-
Ing musicians were on hand and dancing
went on in the boathouse. At intervals
the yachts and rowboats took the guests
out for a moonlight cruise. Among those
present were: Commodore Caduc, Vlce-
Commodore H. G. Hinckley, Secretary
Charles Stewart, Mr. and Mrs. Bowens,
Miss Games, Miss Barteaux. Messrs. C.
L. Taylor, Clyde Carman, Howard Byx
bee arid Miss Blood.
CHARGED WITH MURDER.
Result of a Fight Between John
Palmer and E. R. Paterson
Saturday Night. .
The fight between John Palmer and E.
R. Paterson at 1135 Folsom street, where
they both resided, on Saturday night has
resulted in a charge of murder being
booked at the City Prison yesterday
against Palmer, Paterson having died at
the City and County Hospital yesterday
morning.
Palmer is a pointer and Paterson was a
carpenter. Both families lived in the BfUXM
housÂ«, and Saturday night they quarreled
and fought. Paterson hit Palmer over the
head with a cub, fracturing his skull, and
Palmer grabbed hold of Paterson and
threw him over the banisters to the floor
below, falling after him.
Both men were taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where it was found that Pater
son was suffering from concussion of the
brain. He was sent to the City and
Conntv Hospital Sunday afternoon and
died yesterday morning. Palmer is still in
a serious condition from his fractured
skull.
AT THE BATHS.
Soldiers in Spirited Swimming and
Racing Contests.
The races at Sutro Baths drew a large
if Manila and Santiago are both captured
1 to-day, or even within the present week,
i which will not be at all surprising, it is
: not likely that any more troops will bo
i sent from San Francisco to the Philip
' pines. It is intimated in local military
\ circles that the Washington authorities
; are waiting for the expected to happen
before issuing any more rush orders, and
; if the happening is one of victory, as is
i confidently looked for, then the rush will
j be over.
"We have been making history so rap
idly in the last ninety days that people do
not realize what has 'been actually accom
plished In that short period." said Lieu
tenant Colonel Morris, commandant of the
Presidio, last evening. "They have not
| been able to keep up with the procession.
They have not had time to read more
! than the headlines of the newspaper dis
| patches. Why, just think of it! In three
months we have reached out to the Pa
cific and Atlantic with a strong 1 navy and
a well-organized army, larirely composeu
of volunteers, and have annihilated two
Spanish fleets, and have both Manila and
the Philippines and Santiago and Cuba at
our mercy. The next thing will bo the an
nihilation of the last Spanish fleet, now
in the Mediterranean. That will wipe
Spain off the water, if not off the face of
the earth. The world lias never seen any
thing like this before, and probably never
will again. 1 am glad I have lived to see
this day."
"Those are my sentiments exactly."
chimed in Major Hess, the Third Artillery
veteran.
"Here, too," said several of the Presidio
officers in chorus.
AN ARMY MYSTERY.
Under What Name and in
What Troop Did Robert
Riley Jones Enlist?
Robert Riley Jones, a private in the
ranks, aged IS years, is stationed at some
one of the camps in this city. Just which
one it is, neither his father, who writes
from Chicago, nor any of the officers at
Camp Merritt seem to know. In fact, it
is thought that Master Robert Riley en
listed under an assumed name. The only
clew that Jones senior has to his boy's
regiment is the following extract from a
decidedly dime novelesque letter written
from this city to a young lady in Chi-
cago:
"The captain in our troop is the most
dare-devil captain in the service. It was
he who wont out after some great Indian
chief some few years ago, and, although
he lost his troop, he broke up the war and
brought back the chief. He has been in
the service twenty-four years and he has
the crack rough riding troop in the serv
ice. He Is always given the most danger
ous frontier posts."
So far Captain Jeffery, to whom the let
ter was addressed, has been unable to
discover any one with hair long enough to
identify him as the hero captain of dan
gerous frontier posts.
The boy's father is Sidney B. Jones, an
official of the C. I. and L. Railway Com
pany. He is very much worried over his
i son's whereabouts, but says that he will
allow him to remain in the army if he will
only communicate with his parents.

a Veteran, With a Hatchet.
OAKLAND, July 4.â Louis Figone, a
retail fruit dealer at 408 Seventh street,
struck Frank Newell, a veteran of the
late war, with a hatchet this morning,
laying his cheek open for a considerable
distance. The affair occurred through
Newell defending the American army be
fore Santiago when Figone made light of
its conduct.
The blade of the hatchet used in the at
tack ripped the rim of Newell's hat and
made an ugly gash on his face. He was
removed to his residence, 529 Nineteenth

IN THE DUST
Athletics Do the Trick
Once Again.
YOURS TRULY GETS A HAT
THE SAND AT TIMES MARS THE
CONTEST.
The Athletics Play a Grand Game, !
Yet the Oaklands Contested
Every Point With
Vigor.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Admiral Sampson presented to the
American people as a Fourth of July sur
prise the complete destruction of the
Spanish Santiago licet. The Pacific Coast
League la propelled by an ambitious as
well as patriotic people, and, not to be
outdone even by Mr. Sampson, they pre
sented to the crowd which wended Us way
to Recreation Park yesterday afternoon
B same of ball which was almost perfect,
and concluded the day's work by present
ing me with ;i $i hat.
This latter Incident occurred, however,!
in a most peculiar manner, and I mention j
it simply '.'>â  demonstrate the advantage*
to be gained by mixing in affairs which,
to \n- plain spoken, do not concern one. !
Mr. Kan, i bet Mr. Kaplen, manager of
the Athletics, a S3 hat that the Oaklands
would win the. game. This proposition
was entertained by Mr. Kaplen, Raver
remarking that if he won the hat would
!"â  turned ov< r to the Examiner corre- I
Bpondent 1 could not understand why I \
i be overlooked in such a manner,
all the nice tilings I said about this
man Raver, and battered my way into
the conversation by remarking that my
supply ut' hats was very scarce, I took
occasion, however, to mention this f act i
w hen the .' I, and Mr.
Kaplen, ho doubt fearing' thai if he did |
not observe my hint a roast would follow
in the morning edition, Immediately ejac-
I: "Mr. Corbett, if my team wins
ive the hat." The "dear boy" ,
.l m< merit conjectured that I
wouid take him up, but as 1 said I
rather than be (.aught in a
â¢ i Into taking it, much to
- official scorer. Now, if
thej ha'i only bet an overcoat or a b
it! it certainly is difficult to pli
â  . yet I bi â¢â¢ no reason why the bet i
d not be continued at least until I]
: . o a complete outfit. There is only ;
one thing bothering me In regard to the !
transai tlon. and that is the order for the I
hat. or. rather, will the order for the hat
oored without my being Identified?
This â¢â¢order" busitb B8 may t>e all right
with Point; Individuals, yet i should much
rather have received the nut. Not that
doubts about the genuineness
ler, but l wish i had the hat.
W< 11, In the morning l shall first gc-i that
hat, . t the order, in this
: r I hope to avoid the quality of hat
that-is generally given with an order; for
Instance, the Ki:.a you would receive if
: ed throug â  ler >ou won at
:.- a grave teacher.
'I he h marred the !
ty of -tli<- game was the clouds of
. and then envelop* d
layers and invaded the stands until
me almost unbearable. My! how it
â  â  in that !:â¢ tghborhood! A per-
Bon misses half the game In vainly en
iring to prevent the dust from blind
:inci to add to the discomfiture of
those who were massed In the stands be
side third base was President Bert, blaz
ing away continually with a six-shooter.
Mr. Beit's display of patriotism would
have been much -admired had he reserved
j*e until the game was tiniphtÂ».i.
Barring the wind and dust the game
was dose, beautifully played and intense
ly interesting. The Athletics started off;
by making three runs in the first inning
oil clever batting and base running, as
.by Mr. Russell's inability to lo< â 
the plate. They made another in the sec- i
. ..â¢! i Wo more in the fifth in the same
manner. Theirplaylng in every depart-;
ment was goodâ far above the average.
ThiMr new acquisition, Mr. Fountain,
. â¢ r. was a miserable failure in the!
r"s box, being afflicted with the same
lault as his opponent, Mr. Russell, and was
retired after the second Inning In favor
of" Mr. "Foghorn" Fitapatnck. The |
change wrougnt a marked advantage, as
Fltzpatrick pitched excellent ball, consld- I
ering the fact that he struggled through
a whole game on the day previous, lie
not only pitched well, but entertained the
crowd and kept them in a state of ecstasy
all through the game by his. many comic
and peculiar antics while -on the coachers' j
line. Surely Fitz, you are a wonder!
The support accorded lim was of the
first -class variety, Reilly in particular;
playing clever ball in the field and doing \
terrible execution while at bat, four hits ;
being made by him out of five times up.
Had Stultz not been asleep on the bases !
on one occasion and had Fitzpatrick in j
the seventh inning thrown to second in
stead of first, not a fault would have been
visible in the team's work throughout the
game. These little incident? had no bear-
Ing on the result, however, as their daring
base running and opportune hitting won j
for them the game.
The ' Oaklands. while defeated, also |
played a good' game. Their inability to j
properly connect with the ball is prlnci- !
pally the cause of their defeat. Only six
nits did they make in the entire game, yet |
they scored five runs, and this through
dating baserurmingf. In the seventh they
had a man on secrind and third, with
Hani-hitting Sullivan at bat. A hit was j
necessary to tie the score, but it did not
come, as Sullivan hit an easy grounder j
and was out at first. He. however, stole |
three bases and with Stultz, who had an
t-oual number, must the honors be shared.

i SAN FRANCISCO DEFEATED
Good Batting but Poor Fielding
Was the Play of the Santa
Cruz Team.
SANTA CRUZ, July 4.â To-day's game
was won by Santa Cruz by their superior
batting. Santa Cruz put up a poor field
ing game, but were saved from a. possible
defeat by the effective box work of Dau
benbis, who held the Blue Ribbon boys of
San Francisco down to four hits despite
his poor support. In the first inning both
Krug and Perine were compelled to re
tire from the box. Shea, who was substi
tuted in the second, did fine work through
out the remainder of the game. The score
was as follows:

UNITED BY AN ACCIDENT.
J. C. Bonsell Sprained His Ankle and
His Misfortune Softened His
Heart.
The Glorious Fourth brought both Joy \
and sorrow to J. C. Bonsell of Ukiah. Sor- j
row because when on the eve of closing \
a contract he broke his ankle on the wa- I
ter front and is now laid up in the Har
bor Receiving Hospital, and joy because
through the accident he may be reunited
to his wife, from whom he has been sep- !
arated for three years. For six months j
Bonsell, who owns a brickyard at Ukiah,
has been trying- to secure the contract for i
supplying the bricks for the new wing to !
be added to the insane asylum. He came j
to San Francisco to close up the business |
and had an appointment for 2 p. m. to
day. In order to pass the time he went to I
view the parade, and while crossing the j
street fell and broke his ankle.
Incidently while in San Francisco
Bonsell was to have begun proceedings
for divorce, as he and his wife separated I
three years ago. Instead of that, how
evf-r. he sent for her to call upon him at
the hospital and the chances are that both
of them will return to Fkiah together.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 5, 1898.
SCOTS OUT IN
HIGH REVEL
Grand Outing of the
Thistle Club.
FIVE THOUSAND PRESENT
SHELL MOUND PARK A SCENE
OF GREAT ANIMATION.
In the Evening There Was a Grand
Display of Fireworks in the
Big Ampitheater Over
the Bay.
The sixteenth annual outing of the
Scottish Thistle Club was held yesterday
at Shell Mound Park, and like all previous
events of this organization It was a de
cided success without a single feature to
mar the occasion. Hundreds of people
from San Francisco and the surrounding
cities went there early In the morning, but
the crowd flocked to the grounds In the
afternoon after the big parade in this city
by hundreds, and by 3 o'clock fully 5000
were present. The large pavilion was
filled all day with dancers, many in the
picturesque dress of bonnie Scotland.
Captain Sicbe had taken special pains to
| decorate the grounds and flags of every
color and nation (barring one) found place,
in the gorgeous collection, and above all'
in the most prominent places proudly
floated the stars and stripes. Those dls
, posed to quiet enjoyment found dozens of
cozy little nooks where family lunches
wore spread and where the music of the
bagpipes Jloated in, lending enchantment
to the surroundings.
And there was another element, the
sturdy fellows who take pride in perform
ing feats of strength, skill and agility.
i From early in the morning until evening
the nthletic grounds presented an ani
mated scene. A Scottish picnic without
paints and racc-s would only be half an
outing. The programme this year was
particularly interesting and the prizes of
fered, mostly cash, were extremely liberal.
One of the most charming features, one.
highly appreciated, was a Cakewalk, a
rial old-fashioned ante-bellum coon ex
hibition, in which the best talent on both
sides of the bay participated. Although
half a dozen couples entered into the com
petition the honors and prizes fell to the
lot of Mr. and Miss Stewart. These
prizes were a gold medal and a suit of
clothes for the gentleman and a gold
watch and a sealskin sack for the lady.
! T..e picnic and games were managed by
the following officers of the club and com
mittees:

The approach of the evening did not
cause the merrymakers to depart, as is
usual on such occasions, for all knew that
a great treat was in store for them.
After getting dinner they repaired to the
race course, where one of the finest pyro
technic displays of the Fourth had been
prepared for them. For nearly three
hours they watched the set and other
pieces, many of which had no equal in
brilliancy and beauty.
The outing ended in time for partici
pants who live on this side of the bay to
catch the last boat and all voted that the
Scottish Thistle Club had fairly outdone
itself in the line of furnishing entertain
ment.
HANGED HIMSELF.
An Unknown Man Took Off His
Shoes and Committed Suicide in
a Lumber Yard.
The body of a laboring man about 50
years old was found shortly after 8
o'clock yesterday morning In the Belllng
ham Bay lumber yard at the Intersection
of Chestnut and Sansome streets. One
end of a rope was fastened around the
neck and the other end around the end
of a plank projecting: from a pile of lum
oer. The deceased had taken off his
shoes and secreted or thrown them away
before hanging: himself. The body Is on
the Identification slab In the Morgue.
TROTTERS GIVE
GOOD RACING
New Starting Judge Does
Fine Work.
ZOMBRO WINS A FAST HEA T
BEATS THE MARE ETHEL DOWNS
WITH EixSE.
Rect Adda Still Another Victory,
but Gives His Backers a
Scare â Features for
To-Day.
Racing at the Oakland track was far
more enjoyable yesterday than It has been
for some days. No delays and better start
ing was the order of the day. The "bar
rier" was erected to prevent long, strag
gling scores, and as a consequence Start
ing Judge Cohen got the horses aligned
very readily.
Eight heats were trotted and paced and
the 6 o'clock boat took away the last
bunch of spectators and cleared the
stands. From now on It will be a con
tinuance of the "no delay" system. The
attendance should pick up, as the gate ifÂ»
free. Ladles are hereafter to be guests
of the association.
The finishes were fairly exciting, and
the opening heat could hardly have been
bettered. Osito won It after a dingdong
llnlsh with Thompson in 2:14%. The game
little McKlnney stallion Osito went out
side of Thompson to the head of the
stretch, and the latter, under the whip,
kept bearing out, thus making him trot
"on the ridge" where the footing is not
so good as nearer the pole. They went to
the half in 1:06, a 2:12 clip. Prior to the
heat Monterey was at Z to 5, Thompson
3 to 2, and Osito 2 to 1. The Monterey
money got a grand drive and he must
have trotted at a 2:05 clip.
The second event also went to a McKln
ney, and a Boodle was second.
Ethel Downs (2:10). Zombro (2:11) and
Aster (2:123 i) faced the starter. It was
3 to 5 Downs, even Zombro, 3 to 2 Aster
in the ring, and Ethel was played pretty
stiff. Zombro carried the mare away
boiling, and at the quarter it was 33Vi sec
onds as the "hip" was sounded, 1:06*4 at
the half, and Zombro led the mare a
length. On the stretch Bunch went to the
bat and never let up to the wire, but Zom
bro won it hands down in 2:161-4. Ethel
Downs was not at herself and threatened
to break several times ere she finally left
her stride near the wire. Bunch gave the
money a splendid drive but could not <U-
feat the great son of McKinney. The
Zombro constituents gave a mighty cheer
as their champion passed the wire an un
whipped winner. It was evident Zombro
could have stepped several seconds faster
had it been necesssary.
The Novelty race for 2:24 trotters went
to Rect, 2:16%. C. L. Griffith's great young
son of Direct. He opened at 1 to 2, Little
Miss 3 to 2, Lynall G to 1 and Ned Thorn
4 to 1. Heat winners went to the i>arn
and contested the fourth heat. At the
turn Rect left his feet and it looked all
off, but when thirty lengths back he set
tled. Wekter moved him for the heat On
he came right gamely and mowing one
after the other down overnauled Ned
Thorn inside the short flag and won in
2:W.^. jj c must havi- stepped the last
half at a 2:12 clip, and Webster was de
servedly applauded. Rect. of course, went
to the barn and the rest scored for the
next heat, for which Little Miss was
favorite, as she had won last week in
2:17*4. She was too rank, however, and
Ned Thorn landed It in 2:22*4 over her
handily. Lynall, owned by President
Knight, then lowered Little Miss' colors
In 2:25 and Aloiso showed poor judgment
in thrashing his mare long after the fin
ish. Rect now joined the heat winners
and was a 3 to 10 s..ot properly. He closed
it out in 2:19 and stepped to the half in
1:08^4, some lengths in advance of the
others. Thorn got second money and
Lynall third. Rect is a phenom. and once
straightened away seemingly can trot as
fast as Webster could ask.
The 2:13 pacers threw the talent heavily,
as Jimmy Sullivan's Fitz Lee, 2 to 1,
stepped it off an easy winner in 2:14, the
favorite. Little Thorn, at 7 to 10. making
a disastrous break going away, thon still
another on the stretch, and finished
fourth. It would please some who have
twice backed this great little pacer to see
a right good driver sit behind him, as he
is rated at 2:08 to 2:09 and won so easily
his first race here. Thompson was inter
viewed, but evidently satisfied the offi
cials, as he was discharged without rep
rimand. Pacers are uncertain proposi
tions, yet Thorn apparently outclassed
this lot somewhnt. F W went a grand,
good race and Ketchum for place was a
rattling bet at 2 to 1.
I Direct was favorite in the closing
event, the 2:30 pace, at 8 to 5. Primrose,
2 to 1, second choice, again defeated him
and took a record of 2:14^ in doins: it. I
Direct is but a three-year-old and went
a good race, but the mare outgamed him
after stepping away to the half in 1:05^4.
Ten started and they got the word to a
very fair start. For a wonder Gaff Top
sail went without his usual sulky smash
ing chapter, and all were glad to see
young Smith get him to race, for he is a
flllck-galted follow with a capacity to pace
in the low teens. He was a very fair
fourth and came the last end fast.
There are some grand races in prospect
for this afternoon and the winners seem
hard to select.

WANTED IN BOSTON
FOR EMBEZZLEMENT
JOHN F. WATERS IN THE CITY
PRISON.
After Absconding He Enlisted in the
Fourth Cavalry Under an As
sumed Name ana Deserted.
An embezzler who fled from Boston
three years ago and enlisted in the army
is now an inmate of the City Prison wait
ing his extradition to the city of culture
and beans. .
JohnF. Waters was a talesman and agent
for the firm of A. D. Cairns & Co., Bos
ton, and on July B, lSf*s, he disappeared,
taking with him jewelry and other
articles of the value of over $1000. They
comprised twelve diamond rings, a dia
mond scarf pin, two diamond studs, five
gold watches and chains, two diamond
lockets and three diamond braeelts.-
Waters enlisted in Troop M, Fourth
Cavalry, under the name of Frank J.
Affleck, but shortly afterward deserted.
He was arrested and sent to Alcatraz
Island in August, 1596. That month Colo
nel Guenther notified Chief Inspector
Watts of the Boston police that when
scarf hed at Alcatraz a number of pawn !
tickets for diamond jewelry had been
found upon the prisoner, and Watts at
once communicated with Chief Lees, in
forming him that the military prisoner
Affleck wns probably the defaulting agent
Waters. The Chief at once communicated
with the authorities at Alcatraz and it
was ascertained that the prisoner's sen
tence for desertion would not expire with
credits till March, 1899. It appears, how
ever, that Waters' friends Interceded with
the military authorities and he was par
doned, his pardon to take effect from yes
terday. Detectives Gibson an 3 Wren
â went to the Island yesterday and placed
Affleck, alias Waters, under arrest and
brought him to the City Prison.
Waters was indicted by the Grand
Jury of Boston in April, 1596, on the
charge of felony embezzlement and a
warrant was issued for his arrest. He
will be detained here pending the arrival
of an officer from Boston with the neces
sary extradition papers.

OAKLAND, July ; 4.â There- were prob
\. ably more people' In- this city to-day than
-have ever been within its limits at any
one time. The many features arranged
for public diversion attracted crowds fr-pm
. everywhere and the general rejoicing was
more pronounced than for years.
â¢The street parade depended largely for
Its- success upon the troops which .came
over here to tatke part In the sham bat
tle and also from. Camp' Barrett. A line
â¢ of march was forced ' through the (nor
-. â¢ Tnous crowds^ on the streets and unlike

It .on time. The troops from . San Fran- ',

PLAYED AT WAR.
The battlefield Bl=Â»ck With Hu
manity but Not an Accident
to Mar th^ Dqy
OAKLAND, July 4.â The first sham bat
tle ever belo in this city passed off this
afternoon without a mishap. Never in
the history of the city has suoh a wrong
congregated within its limits within
sight of each other. Mayor Thomas. City
â Attorney Dow, John A. Brittan. John
Mitchell, So] Kahn, ex-Councilman Mott
and F. M. Farwell estimated the audi
ence on Adams Point and around the lake
at from fifty to one hundred thousand
persons.
Colonel H. C. Kessler divided the First
Montana Volunteer Regiment, taking the
First and Second Battalions* except.Com
pany E, the color company, for an at
tacking force, and leaving the Third Bat
tKlion and Company E for the defensive.
The latter consisted of companies F, I, E,
B and A. with Major John R. Miller in
command.
The First and 'Second Battalions, under
command of Lieutenant Colonel R. B.
Wallace, left the Point- shortly after - 1
o'clock and started" 'off in a northeasterly
, direction. After they had been " gone
half an hour s or more Major : Miller de
ployed his skirmish line. They went out
nearly a mile. . In the meantime the at
tacking force. was seen coming out of a
clump of trees nearly two miles off, back
of the Anderson property. Steadily they
advanced with a heavy skirmish line in
front. The first shot was fired at 3:05
o'clock, .with the fence dividing the Ad
ams Point- property from the Anderson,
home, between- the contending forces.
Major Miller's skirmishers were rapid
; ly driven back, but he advanced his com
mand nearly half the distance to .support
them. Then the tables turned under a
heavy fire..- Colonel Wallace's, command
was driven back to the fence in a hurry.
I With a rush the men tumbied over it with
Major Miller's, forces right on top of
i them. '. - â '.â - v -, *"> ' -.- â¢ .
â¢Rut there the latter met an unloosed
! for rebuff. Colonel Wallace had a reserve
! of two or three' companies,.. Tnese, lying
: under cover' of. the hill and fence, turned
loose upoH the auvancing â¢ army.' This
stopped them, and as the retreating men
! fell in Major Miller's men were-- arjven
back with heavy Tiring. The .-men con
i tiued retreattng, firing at will, until they
1 reached the. ravine, where the ammuni-,
i tion gave our. : -.'- n T'*
! Each side claimed a victory, but the
retreat of Major Miller' s-^ command when

and the decision^. -The battle "lasted but

The crowd behaved admirably and

At the close of the battle dress parade
was held,' after which Mayor Thomas pre-
I sented the regiment with a handsome allk

to make the day a success in this- city.
The troops marched down Broad way at

for Oakland and everybody they met.
They seemed like a lot nf happy school
boys out on a picnic, tired and dirty.
THOUSAN DS ENTERTAIN ED
Soldiers Served With Coffee,,
Sandwiches and Fruit
in Abu r dHnc^.
OAKLAN'P, Jv.]y 4.â lmmediately after
the parade the soldiers marqhed to Adams
Point, where preparations had been made
!to entertain them. Nearly 2000 soldiers
j were present when arms were stacked
near the Golf Club House and the com
; mand given io "Charge the tables" Two
I talilos set in a. parallelogram about 50x200
f'e< I long v. â¢â¢ -re covered with stacks of
; solid and dainty viands.
Company after company assaulted the
tables, taking everything in si^ht, but as
Often as they retreated the tables were
filled again and none left hungry. The
soldiers were so surprised at the unlimited
supply that they cheered time and again.
for the Ladles' generosity, in the midst
of the meal Mayor Thomas mounted a
table and read a bulletin announcing the
.entire destruction of Admiral Ceryera's
fleet by Admiral Sampson at Santiago.
Cheer upon cheer rent the air, which was
ta^en up by thp outsiders and carried
through the vast assemblage.
Fire broke out during the dinner hour
i in the grass, but Company A of the Fifth
Regiment, N". G. C, jumped In and with
coats and hats soon beat it out amid the
clurrs of the spectators.
The refreshment committee was ably
supported by the Red Cross Society, who
knew well how to prepare for such a host
after their experience of wÂ» eks at the
ferry depot in looking after the comfort
sirni'refneshment 'of the incoming troops.
The officers and men could not-say enough
regarding the hospitality of Califom.a.
We were never treated so at home,"
said*, major in speaking of thÂ« luncheon.
"Why, California seems never to tire of
showing her hospitality. 1 would never
have believed smh a thing possible had
1 not seen it. Wo have all been treated
royally and ft is impossible to tind
words to express our appreciation."
FOREST. OF FIREWORK-.
The Day's Rejoicing Concludes
With a Fiery Memento
of the Maine.
OAKLAND, July 4.â There was nothing
cheap or ancient about the fireworks dis
play on IJake Merrltt to-night. The commit
tee arrangea a series of forty-five distinct
numbers, each of which drew out hearty
commendation from the tens of thousands
of people who witnessed them â¢ from
Adams Point, the Twelfth-street dam, the
Eleventh-street trestle and every con
ceivable point of vantage where human
beings could station themselves.
Every imaginable novelty was intro
duced in the display. At times the burst
ing in the air of brilliant shells illumin
ated the hill? on all sides and cast long
streams of bright colors across the lake,
flocfcets ;isi;nded by hundreds. Occasion
ally' the air was filled with golden rafn. .
droves of golden and van-colored trees
shot into the air and exploded with
thunderous noise, to be followed by a j
host of hissing, fiery . reptiles curling
BTcrand hundreds of feet above the lake
and finally bursting into myriads of gold
eh .drops.
The large ai\d powerful colored lights ;
that were burned produced picturesque ef- '
for a mile around, and shining as ;
they did on seas- of faces made a most re- I
markable feature of the pyrotechnic.
The finale was the destruction of the
â¢fort. While the cannon from the monitor I
'was. belching forth fire and shot, hun
dreds of rockets flew into the; air, throw
ing out volleys of suns, while at the same
time red fire was freely burned and all
ended with an aerial display of small py
rotechnics; out of which - Old Glory un
furled and the brilliant transparency in
letters a: yard 1/road, the countersign,
"Remember the Maine."
A JOKE ON ARPER.
It Supplied a Bit of Fuel to Add
to the El feet on
Morro.
OAKLAND, July 4.â George W, Arper,
president of the Merchants' Exchange,
was much annoyed to-day to learn that
some one had hoisted a Spanish flag over j
his oil works on the Alameda side of the
estuary In place of the American flag,
which he had hoisted.
When Mr. Arper went to his place of I
business this morning ho was surprised '
to find the halyard of his flagpole cut and
the stars and stripes gori". While <-\i
ffaged in reefing.new halyards a, stranger j
approached Mrv. Arper and produced a |
big Spanish Hag, stating that he had seen :
it flying on Mr. Arper's flagpole and had
taken upon himself the task of cutting
It down. Mr. . Arper does not know who . i
could have attempted puch a stupid joke,
but he took the Spanish flag to the Mer
chants' Exclmngo and it was placed over i
Morro <'astle and to-night shared in the 'â 
general destruction of that fort.
AT OTH EH PLACES.
Much Enthusiasm, at Other
Gatherings in Alameda
County.
OAKLAND, July 4.â The celebration at
! Haywards was carried out fully and with
I great success. There was a large at
! tendanoe from many surrounding towns
! and over a hundred prizes were given for
1 athletic sports and to the lucky holders j
! of winning numbers in the gate drawing, i
i One of the features of the day was a
| game of baseball between a team of
county officials captained by Cal Ewing
and the flaywards Fats, consisting of
married men of Eden Township.
At the new mining town of Tesla an- f
other patriotic demonstration took place, i
al -vrhich people from Livernjore and
Other places in Murray Township en- j
joyed themselves. Director Treadwell
provided a good time for all the visitors
and a very successful day closed with a,
display of fireworks.
At Farmers' Union Hall in Livermare a
Fourth of July ball was given this even- \
! Ing under the auspioea of the Native â¢
R..tis. Dancing was followed by a ban- j
; quet. -
MORRO BOMBARDED.
The Monitor "Greater Oak
land" Batters the Fort
Into Ruins.
OAKLAND. July 4.â On the east side of
Lake Merritt near Newton avenue, Morro
Ga&le w:is built, and all day long the tur
retÂ£d monitor "Greater Oakland" was
anchored in the lake in command of Ad
miral J. H. HolJiday.
The only bit of yellow in Alameda Coun
ty to-day was the Spanish flag flying over
Morro Castle, and to-night it was cap
tured by the sailors from the monitor
; . â¢â  t < r the destruction of the fort by Great
â¢ :â  i 'akland's guns.
The monitor was armed with two one
poundors and was a capital illustration of
;i modern war vessel pf its type. This
evening before the firework display the
plucky little vessel fired her guns at
Morro Castle. There was no return fire,
and after the first shot it was evident
that the soldiers in the fort had taken
t" the.tr heels and deserted their post, me
monitor kept up a lively fire for several
minutes, and finally the castle was
knocked to pieces amid tumultuous cheers
which almost drowned the noise of the
giuns. The wreck of Morro took fire at
nn opportune moment and shortly after
ward all remnants of the Spanish fortifi
cations were being b.own about by the
evening breeze.
Morro Castle was designed by V. P.
Mitchels and was the best representation
of a fort that could be erected. The color
ing was particularly truthful, and as Mr.
MitcJjels had taken his design from au

tions, thfe effect was very natural. The
painted guns which peered through <ts
port â¢ holes were so realistic that the
crowd wondered that they did not make
reply to the attack from the monitor.

of the day was the Realization stakes
for three-year-olds at a mile and five
; furlongs. Hamburg was the favorite,
I while Plaudit, the winner of many
Western races, was a strong second
i choice, and the brother of the great
: Henry of Navarre, The Hugnenot, was
third choice. The race was run in the
! pouring rain, amid crashes of thunder
und almost constant lightning.
They got away well, with The Hugue
1 not in front. The Huguenot maintained
, his lead through the first mile of the
journey. Then Hamburg rushed past
the Thompson representative, and, as
they rounded tho lower turn, began to
open a gap, which he seemed to be able
to make as wide as he pleased. \Vh> n
they were straightened out cm the back-
stretch he was five lengths in front and â 
going easily, while Plaudit- and The
Huguenot were struggling in the rear
for he place.
After a mile and a quarter had been
run it could be seen that the mighty son
of Hanover was playing with the oth
ers. From that point on Sloan took a
steadying pull on Hamburg and he won
easily by a length, merely galloping at
the end. Plaudit was tifteen lengths
ahead of George Boyd. Results:
First race, six furlongs, Sanders won.

PASTORS ASK
FOR JUSTICE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
~~BAN JOSE, July" 4.â The Pastors-
Union, at its last meeting, took up the
question of the dismissal of Professor
L. R. Smith from the vice-principalship
I of the High School, and the methods of
the City Board of Education in manag
ing school affairs were thoroughly ven
tilated. The union is composed of all
the Protestant ministers in town, and,
while the action taken was individual
ly, they represent several thousand of
the best people of the city. Resolutions
asking the school Trustees to reinstate
Professor Smith were unanimously
adopted and signed by every pastor in
town. This is a strong indorsement,
as one of the charges against Smith
was that he was an infidel. The reso
lutions follow:
Whereas. It has come to our knowledge that
the Board of Education of the city of San Jose
has recently, without the assignment of a just
and sufficient cause, retired from the faculty
of the High School Professor L. R. Smith, who
has established for himself in this community
an enviable reputation as one of the most
competent and useful teachers in our public
schools, and whereas, a large majority of the
pupils, alumni and patrons of said High
School, together frith a very large number of
the most rpputahle citizens of San Jnse, haw
publicly exprersed the utmost confidence In
both tho personal character and marked ability
of Professor Smith and have protested against
his retirement from the position so long and so
creditably filled by him; therefore.
Resolved, That as a Pastors" Union and as
individuals we hereby express our hearty sym
patlly in behalf of the movement for the re
instatement of Professor L. R. Smith, and do
earnestly join in the request made by the tax
payers, voters, fathers and mothers to the
Honorable Board of Education of the city of
San Jose that he be restored to Ills former posi
tion in the High School.
Resolved, That we deeply deplore the re
puted exercise of outside political influences
and constraint of "bossism" in the manage
ment of our public school affairs, as Illustrated
in the summary retirement of Professor Smith
and other competent teachers, and do enter
our protest against such interference as a
menace to the high character, purity and ef
ficiency of our educational system.

IT IS TIME TO
SUE FOR PEACE
Loss of Cervera's Fleet
May End the War.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Ooi>yrighted, 1888, by James Gor
don Bennett.
CADIZ, July 4.â The destruction of
Cervera's fleet, It is believed, will ter
minate the war. Already it is rumored
that serious trouble is brewing in Ma
drid, and Cadiz is on the tip-toe of ex
citement, exasperated by an absurd
censorship which prevents the circula
tion of hews.
PARIS, July 4.â "Spain has not an
hour to lose to sue for peace." This is
the closing phrase of the Temps' leader
to-night. The article is full of .sym
pathy for the brave people brought low,
but it leaves no room for misconcep
tion. The destruction of Cervera's
squadron, It says, and the taking of
Santiago are more than appears im the
surface. The disasters mean the de
struction of Spain's naval power. Heavy
cannon and stout armor have carried
the day.
"If it is true," says the Temps, "that
with the exception of a single vessel
the entire Spanish fleet has been de
stroyed, It is a disaster almost equally
as crushing as the destruction of the
great Armada. Once more the sea has
betrayed Spain to the profit of the
Anglo-Saxon race, which appears
under no matter what Hag it fightsâ
whether it be the stars and stripes <>r
the union jackâ to be a favorite of the
ocean."
The Temps goes on to say: "Nobody
can ignore what is the cruel and una
voidable necessity to which this crush
ing blow condemns Spain. Our con
science would not compel us to give this
noble people hard but salutary counsels
were it not for the petty and miserable
policy of falsehood and egotism that
seem to triumph over patriotism in
Spain. There is not an hour to be lost
in suing for peace."
A dispatch to the Matin from Madrid,
published to-day, says: In spite of the
bellicosity of the official utterances, Se
nor Sagasta is ardently desirous of
peace and has already taken steps to
arrange for a. cessation of hostilities.
The general feeling of the Cabinet yes
terday evening was that peace should
be immediately sought if disaster over
takes Santiago de Cuba.
LONDON July s.â The Times re
marks editorialiy this morning: Ad
miral Sampson's brilliant exploit was
as complete as Admiral Dewey's was.
Nothing but the conviction that his
plight within the harbor was hopeless
could have justified Admiral Cervera's
attempt to leave. Had he been able to
judge correctly of what was passing in
General Shafter's mind, doubtless he
would have, remained. The difficulties
of navigation probably caused him to
make a bold effort by daylight. It is
not easy at this moment to foresee the
wide consequences of the unchallenged
supremacy of the American fleet in Cu
ban waters. Overpowered, after an
heroic defense. Spain's only course is â
her friends even in the French press
urge her â to seek peace, which even if
onerous cannot be dishonorable.
A dispatch from Berlin to the Daily
News says: Feelers were put out from
Spanish quarters with a view to as
certaining how the powers and the
United States are likely to regard the
terms of peace that Spain is willing to
propose. These arc said to be:
First â The independence of Cuba.
Second â That Cuba pay a tribute to
Spain for twenty year 3.
Thirdâ That Spain keep a small gar
rison at a small port during that
period.
Fourth â That other powers be en
titled to maintain small bodies of
troops on the island for the protection
of their own subjects.
Fifthâ That the Philippines be de
clared independent of tribute, and that
the Spanish occupation of one island be
permanent.
Sixthâ That Porto Rico be occupied
by the United States as a pledge for the
punctxial payment of indemnity, and
that the island be evacuated after
Spain shall have fulfilled her obliga
tions.
PANDO'S ARRIVAL
MAKES SHAFTER'S
TASK DIFFICULT
NEW YORK, July 4.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
By the arrival of Pando's troops it is
estimated the troops of Linares were
augmented by from 5000 to 10.000 Span
iards from Manzanillo. Thus General
Shafter may find the situation at noon
to-morrow more difficult than was ex
pected, especially when it is urged that
even if the elements of the shore bat
teries should be eliminated, Admiral
Sampson would have to remove the
mines from the harbor before he could
enter, which, therefore, causes seme
fear that there may be delay
in bombarding the city. Competent
critics, nevertheless, seem confident
that General Shafter will be able to
deal with the situation according to his
programme.

REFUSED TO
WAIT ON HIM
Why George Gates Was
Thrown Into Prison.
HOGAN'S STRANGE CONDUCT
THE ASSISTANT PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY IN TROUBLE.
After Notifying the Defendant
He Then Issues a War
rant for His
Arrest.
Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Hogan
of Judge Conlan's court is likely to find
himself in serious trouble on account of
a rather threatening letter which he in
dited to George Gates, who Is now under
arrest for obtaining money by false pre
tenses.
About a week ago a man named J. F.
Schneider visited Judge Conlan's court
and ask< d f.>r a warrant for the arrest of
Gates. Ho represented that the latter
had swindled him out of $60 and demanded
that he be arrested.
After listening to his story Hogan, who
seems determined to run mitters to suit
himself, told -Schneider to call again in a
few days. Alter he had left, the officious
assistant prosecuting attorney of Police
Court No. Â« indited the following letter to
Gates:
Mr. J. . F. T. Schneider has complained to
me and says that last April by means of false
pretenses you secured from him JtiO by repre
senting that you were to â¢ manufacture ma
chines for some Klondike purpose. Mr.
Schneider has asked for a warrant for your
arrest, and unless you can give a satisfactory
reason for obtaining the money or refund the
came you will probably be placed under arrest.
Call at my office at 10 o'clock to-morrow, as
I want to see you about the matter.
Suspecting something wrong. Gates at
once visited his attorney and showed him
the letter. After reading it he advised
Gates not to pay any attention to it.
Evidently piqued at Gates' refusal to
ccc him, Hogan lost no time in issuing
a warrant for his arrest, charging him
with obtaining money by false pretenses.
After the warrant was signed by Judge
Conlan it was at once sent to the Central
Police Station to l>e served. Gates was
subsequently arrested and formally
charged. His attorney is surely vexed at
the rather peculiar action of ogan and
threatens to make it very interesting for
him.
<:lt\ explains his conduct by saying
that it is the custom when a complaint is
made against a business man to write him
ling a warrant for his arrest.
Just why lie requested him to call at his
private office instead of his place at the
t'ity H.i l he refuses t" exolaln. The at
tornej for Gates is extremely indignant
ov r th>- action of the assistant prose
cuting attorney, and he threatens to bring
the matter before Judge Conlan when the
Is heard.
FIRST FIRE OF THE FOURTH.
Three Buildings on Lombard Street
Totally Destroyed.
Thrff dwelling houses situated on the
rlooking the corner of Lom
bard ami Polk streets were totally de-
Btroyed by fire early yesterday morn
ing-. The estimated loss of the building
tii th< is $5000. It was owned by
M. C. Maunder.
The building situated to the immedi
ate rear of Maunders property was
owned by Nelson C. Fawkes, Chark-s
Tiuy being the owner of the adjoin
ing- building, which was almost entirely
destroyed.
The origin of the fire is not known,
but it is thought to be due to the ex
ploston of a skyrocket.
Maunder claims that the buildings
could have b< en saved if it had not
been for the negligence of the watch
man on duty in the cut below, who
failed to turn in an alarm or arouse the
inmates of the burning buildings.
places the total
loss from the fire at $2500.
EXPLOSION IN A STORE.
A Strange Force Wrecks Two Places
of Business.
A mysterious explosion occurred
last evening in the cigar store oc
cupied by C. M. Crook and owned
by General ICeys, and located near the
corner of Third and Silver streets, almost
wmrking the store and considerably dam
aging the grocery, adjoining.
At 11:15 p. m., the time of the explosion,
the cigar, sure was closed with heavy
Iten bound shutters, which were blown
outward by the force of the blast. No
gas Is. used on the premises, and the po
iice- are at a loss to conjecture the cause.

Duncan and Edward O'Neill, and charged
them at the Seventeenth-street station
with battery. They were both under the
Influence of liquor when arrested.

The Prize-Winners.
"Old Glory's" stars? and stripes floated j

address, dealing with the history of the

this countryâ even the victories of Dewey
p.nd Sampson came in for a mention here.
And how the crowd did yell at each men
tion of the heroes' names.
Honorable Robert Ferral delivered the
oration of the day, entitled, "The Day We
Celebrate." His remarks were principally
of a historical nature and the history of
the last few days took a prominent part.
More cheering.
Eustace Cullinan read an original poem
of a patriotic nature and was roundly ap
plauded. Honorable Augustine Costello
of New York spoke on "We Need No
Alliance." His words were moderate, be- ;
he believed the proposition made

THE SAN" FTtANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 5, IS9B.
SUMNER HARDY
IS CHAMPION
He Defeats Holmes in
the Final Match.
CLOSING TENNIS GAMES
NICHOLSON AND MURDOCK WIN
THE CONSOLATION.
Mediocre Tennis, Youthful Enthusi
asts and a Large Ciowd
at the Tourna
ment.
The championship tennis tournament at
San Rafael has come to a close and Sum
ner Hardy is the man upon whom the
honor sits. The three days' battle on the
courts was unproductive of bloodshed or
surprises. The list of casualt.es Is a
sprained ankle, which belongs to young
Mr. Code exclusively. In the enthusiasm
of youth and vaulting ambition he es
sayed to return a ball that was a little
too swift for his pace and he fell on the
hard bitumen. Three strong men assisted
in clearing the court, and the play con
tinued.
When the final match of the tourney
was called the stands were crowded with
i the proverbial parterre of beauty and
trousered valor. One thing that was lack
ing was the old peanut and chewing
candy man with his stores of mucilagin
ous confections. The young lames signed
and moaned for dental exercise, but the
fates willed a round and complete nega-
I tive. All that was accorded them was the
I excitement of conversation and an ocea
| sional thought.
Hardy and Holmes fought it out for the
, badge of the Legion of Honor. Never
i before in the history of coast champion
â  Bhip tournaments was such nerveless
playing seen in the concluding match
which was to settle the disposition of the
cup and a prize racket. Hardy won the
first set. 6-3. With the greatest ease he
: won the first five games and then faltered
in the finish. Holmes came up the stretch
j with a burst of speed that netted him
! three games. Then Hardy showed a touch
| of remorse and annexed the sixth game
; to his account and the set was his.
The second set went to Holmes. Hardy
took the first two games and that was all,
for Holmes displayed a streak of real
lighting spirit that took the ginger out
|of his opponent. In succession Holmes
won the six succeeding games, which
! made Mr. Hardy of Oakland lose his
usual nonchalance during the ten minutes
rest that followed.
Both men made use of water during the
wait, internally and externally. The re
sult was a coolness all round. The little
harmless courtesies that passed between
the contestants in the first two sets gave
way to grim determination and no smiles
were lost. Game by game the set was
fought until victory shone upon the
racket-wielder from Oakland. The score
of tliis set was 7â5 and was the closest
of the match. The fourth set was "easy
money" for the rooters from the Athens
of the Pacific Coast. Holmes took but
one game, but he seemed satisfied. The
score was G â 3, 2â6,2 â 6, 7â5,7 â 5, 6âl.6 â 1.
The consolation doubles were played
during the morning. In the preliminary
rounds Nicholson and Murdock defeated
Adams and Welhe, 9â7.9 â 7. 6â4.6 â 4. Lands
berger and Boweii BUCCUmbed to Sam
Hardy and Paul Selby, 6â2, 4â6, 6â2.
Nicholson and Murdock defeated Code
anil Davis. In this match Code sprained
his ankle. He was unable to continue
the play, but during the rest of the day
he was an enthusiastic spectator on the
side lines, where, shielded from the with
ering rays of the sun by a white silk
parasol, he did service ac linesman. The
picture was one of innocence under a
chaste protection.
The finals of the consolation doubles
proved to be the best tennis of the day.
Nicholson and Murdock after a hard fight
won out, the score being 2â6, 6â2,6 â 2, 6â3.
As George Whitney did not defend the
sup Sumner Hardy is now the champion.
TORNADO STRIKES

Considerable Damage to Property and
Heavy Loss of Life
Reported.
HAMPTON, N. H., July 4.â A tornado
struck a section of Hampton Beach at
3:15 o'clock to-day, causing Immense dam
age to beach property and heavy loss of
life. Cottages were blown flat, horses were

Ing the Mohican River here fell this after
noon with 1000 people. Four were killed
outright and a hundred injured, some of
thorn seriously. A public wedding was

The panic which ensued was Indescriba
ble, and it was Impossible to get anything
like a correct list of the wounded. "Many
persons suffered broken limbs, but very
few if any of the injured are likely to die.
PERKINS OPPOSES MORTON.
Seeks to Prevent the San Franciscan's
Canfirmation.
WASHINGTON, July 4.â lt appears
that S. S. Morton's nomination as Re
ceiver of the Land Office at San Fran
cisco will be opposed by Senator Perkins
A member of the Senate Committee says
Perkins has asked that the report be held
up for several days. If is believed Sena
tor Perkins hopes to finally defeat the
confirmation, though on what ground is
not apparent at this time.
Morton's nomination was secured
through the influence of Representative
Loud without Perkins' knowledge. Here
lately there has been a disposition by the
two Californians to heal their differences
but Morton's appointment and confirma
tion will create more trouble between
them.
CALIFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, July 4.â Fred B. Per

HE MISSED A
GOLDEN CHANCE
T. Harris Now Reaps the
Benefit of It.
IS ROBBED IN PART ONLY
THE MIDNIGHT INTRUDER IS A
POOR WORKMAN.
Why the Gentleman From the Capital
Is Buying Cigars for His
Friends and Ac- .
quaintances.
T. Harris of Sacramento, accompanied
by his friend, George G. Davis, of the
same municipality, came to town on Sun
day and registered at the Grand. While
In the realm of the sweet forgetfulness
of sleep his room was entered on Sunday
night by some visitor with "touching"
tendencies and now Mr. Harris Is minus
a purse and $25. Strange to say, he is
rejoicing over his loss, and any friend
that happens to meet him on the street
may count on smoking a good cigar at
his expense.
It is not because Harris is congratulat
ing himself on an exemption from vio
lence at the hands of the intruder. It is
because the midnight rilcher only per- j
formed half a job. When Harris went to
bed he forgot to lock the door. This was
his mistake.
What would ordinarily be considered an
act of rashness, under the circumstances
proved to be a piece of consummate strat
egy on the part of Harris. Before retiring
he folded his trousers carefully and
placed them on the chair nearest the |
dour. The pocket-explorer was assisted t
by the Bacramento visitor in tins respect, i
for all things were made convenient for |
him. A slipping of a dextrous hand into
the pocket and bringing out a purse with
$25 in it was accomplished by the robber, j
but in his haste he forgot something. In
the watch pocket of the trousers Mr. Har
ris had $350 in gold, and this if still left to
him. The stupidity of the robber is what
astonishes him, as the two pockets were
close together in the garment. Davis is
convinced that this could never happen in
Sacramento. According to his method of
computation he is just $350 ahead, and j
that is why he enjoys seeing his friends
smoke at his expense.
The purse was all that was removed.
REVOLUTION BREAKS
OUT IN MONTEVIDEO
Quelled After a Battle in Which
Four Hundred Are Killed or
Wounded.
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, July 3.â A i
revolution has broken out in the capital.
The Fourth Regiment of Light Artillery,
headed by General Estevan, has mv- |
tinied. Firing began early this morning.
The Government declared the city in a j
state of siege and called out the national !
guards.
The revolt, it is asserted, has been i
quelled. The chiefs of the revolting regi
ments have submitted. Generals Garcia,
Estoban and Arribio have surrendered. |
Their lives will be spared. The city is
much damaged.
It is estimated that the killed and
wounded number 400.
All is now .jiij.-t.
WAS STRUCK BY A
SQUALL AND SUNK
Steamer Surf City Lost and About
Twenty People Went Down
With Her.
BEVERLY. Mass., July 4.â The steamer
Surf City, while on her trip over from Sa
lem Willows, was struck by a squall at
6 o'clock to-night and sunk about a quar
ter of a mile off her wharf here. There
were from 100 to 150 persons on board at
the time and a large number were res
cued by boats from the shore. It is be
lieved that between fifteen and twenty

NEWSPAPERS YET TIED UP.
Will Not Resume Publication at
Chicago Until Wednesday.
CHICAGO, July 4.â None of the Chica
go newspapers will resume publication be
fore "Wednesday morning. The publish
ers have made all arrangements for re
sumption to-morrow with papers of four
pages in size, to be increased day by day
as rapidly as practicable. This evening
the president of the International Typo
graphical Union and the district organ
izer waited on the publishers and made
a strong request that publication be de
ferred twenty-four hours longer, urging
as a reason that if the issue had to be
met by their union to-night there might
be trouble about observing their contract
obligations with the publishers. They
were very sanguine that the union would
keep to its contract and not quit because
of the stereotypers' strike, but wished an
opportunity to canvass and discuss the
matter to-morrow.
The publishers assert that stereotypers
are coming into the city from various
points in gratifying numbers and are con
fident that they will be well equipped for
issuing papers slightly reduced in size
by Wednesday morning.

I to bail out the tiller was left unguarded â¢.
| for a moment and the yacht capsized, j
! The three men and another, name un
known, started to swim ashore. The re
sult was that three were drowned, the
j other barely managing to reach shore, j
i Much damage was done by the storm, I

LORD BYRON
WAS FOOLED
His Highness Upset by a
Telephone Belle.
AT THE UNION PARK
GOOD COURSING AFTER HARES
THAT ARE FED ON GRAIN.
List of Winners and Losers at the
Two Meetings Hold in the
Respective Inclosed
Grounds.
The attendance at Union Coursing Park
yesterday was large, considering the
counter attractions. The sporting feat
ure of the clay was a consolation stake
for dogs that were beaten on Saturday,
and although a number of courses were
closely contested, there wore a few sur
prises which upset the calculations of the
pleasure hunters, who have learned con
siderable in the last year about dogs,
their breeding and past performances.
The day, although slightly darkened by
sea c'ouds, was pleasant, and the fog In
no wise interfered with the coursing,
which was first class all down the line.
The favorites won their respective
courses until the fourth race, when the'
burning of pockets commenced. Lord
Byron, a high-class dog, was placed in
the slips with Telephone Belle, and the
talent, feeling that the 'â¢hello" lady would
not score one point in ten, plunged heav
ily on his lordship, and when the betting
closed the Lord was selling for $20, while
his slip mate brought only one silver
dollar, and at this figure takers were
scarce.
His Lordship jumped into the lead im
mediately after being slipped and scored
first turn and a few wrenches. The Tele
phone Lady thought it was about lime
to ring up something, and in a drive she
passed her opponent, took immediate
charge of her game and never allowed
His Lordship a chance to score again
until the end of the course.
Those who ventured on the short end
felt elated of course, and doubtless went
home happy.
Little Dorritt won a flag over Lady Gay,
a 2 to 1 favorite. In the third round
Beauty Spot, a 1 to 4 shot, bowled over
Hercules, who has a fancy for lurching,
and Miller's Maid handsomely disposed of
Sarcastic, who was played pretty strong
in the auction pools to win the stake.
The linal course of the day, between
Beauty Spot and Belle of Moscow, at
tracted to the pool boxes many specu
lators. Owing to a hard course the Belle
had with Miller's Maid, which dog she
beat with several points to spare, many
of the wise people played Beauty on the
short end, but Belle of Moscow had con
dition and staying qualities and won a
good race and the long end of the purse.
The rounds are as follows:
Consolation stake results: Wildflower beat
Rich and Artless; Mona beat is B; Our Boy
beat Black Paul; Telephone Belle beat Lord
Byron; Beauty .Spot beat St. Carlo; Chill Pep
per ran a bye; Speed beat Grasshopper; Her
cules beat Belle of Seville; Arno beat Rey Al
fonso; Beauty beat Royal Chief; Empire beat
Arrah Go On; Little Dorritt beat Lady Gay;
Sarcastic beat Glenwood; Beatrice beat Ala
meda; Miller's Maid beat Kill Boy; Do Me
beat Don Jose; Solerno beat Waratah; Belle
of Moscow beat Master McGregor.
Second â Mona beat Wlldflower; Our
Boy boat Telephone Belle; Beauty Spot beat
Chill Pepper: Hercules beat Speed; Beauty
beat Arno; Little Dorritt beat Empire; Sar
castic beat Beatrice; Miller's Maid beat Do
Me; Belle of Moscow beat Solerno.
Third round â Mona bea t Our Boy: Beauty
Spot beat Hercules; Little Dorritt beat Beau
ty: Miller's Maid beat Sarcastic; Belle of Mos
cow a bye.
Fourth â Beauty Spot beat Mona: Belle
of Moscow beat Little Dorritt; Miller's Maid
a bye.
Fifth roundâ Spot ran a bye; Belle
of Moscow beat Miller's Maid.
Finalâ Belle of Moscow beat Beauty Spot
and wen first money.
A rather strange coincidence in coursing
history occurred last Sunday. The win
ner of the stake at Ingleside was Old
Glory and the winner at Union Park was
For Freedom, which, in the language of
Jim Edmonds, one of the fathers of local
coursing, means "Old Glory, For Free
dom."
COURSING AT JNGLESIDE.
A Holiday Crowd Witnesses a
Number of Exciting
Races.
As was predicted by the talent, Johnny
R won the all-aged stake at Ingleside
yesterday. Their predictions, however,
came near being reversed, as Royal
Prize, the young dog owned by W. Flynn,
defeated Rapid, Leonora, Sir John Arnott
and qualified for the final. He gave John
ny R as close a tussle as has been wit
nessed at the famous park in years. The
latter set a terrific pace at "the outset,
but the youngster clung to him and, to
the surprise of every one, passed the
black dog and began to score heavily.
Had not Johnny R made the kill she
would have been tied; as It was he won
by a score of 16 to 14.
Favorites won as a rule, but the talent
fell down in four instances when odds
ranged from 3 to 2 to 1. Sir John Arnott
and Lady Jane carried off honors with
Royal Prize. Magnets was looked upon
as a sure winner, but to the surprise of
every one lost ignnminiously to Sir John.
Following is the way the dogs ran:
All HRed stake â J. Sheehan's Lass o' Gowrle
beat .las. Byrne's Clipper: Lowe A- Thompson's
Victor beat J. Euan's Hilly Gladstone; Kay <t
Trant's Leonora beat 11. Weber's Montana: W

M. J. Dougherty's Peaceful Glen beat 0. F.
BroWn' â  Rosalie: J. Mnrnane's Valley Maid
beat Dillon & Rellly's Granuale; Handy &
