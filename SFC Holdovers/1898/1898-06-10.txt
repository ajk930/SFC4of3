INSURGENTS SAW CERVERA'S
FLEET IN SANTIAGO HARBOR
UNCLE SAM: "NOW I KNOW I'VE GOT 'EM."
PAYS A BEAUTIFUL
TRIBUTE TO HOBSON
ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH BOAT
DAUNTLESS, OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, June 5 (via Kingston,
Jamaica, June 6). â Commodore Schley paid a beautiful tribute to the
valor of Lieutenant Hobson and the gallant crew of the collier Merrimac
as he sat on the afterdeck of the flagship Brooklyn, lying five miles
off Santiago de Cuba, on Sunday afternoon, talking with a correspon
dent of the Associated Press. Pointing toward the gray walls of Morro
Castle, where Lieutenant Hobson and li is brave men were said to be
incarcerated, the commodore spoke as follows:
"History does not recite an act of finer heroism than that of the gallant
men who are prisoners over there. I watched the Merrimac as she
made her way to the entrance to the harbor, and my heart sank as I saw
the perfect hell of lire that fell upon" those devoted men. I did not think
it was possible that one of them could have gone through it alive. They
went into the jaws of death. It was Baiaklava over again, without the
means of defense which the Light Brigade had. Hobson led a forlorn
hope, without the power to cut his way out. But fortune favored the
brave, and I hope he will have the recognition and promotion he de
serves. His name will live as longas the heroes of the world are remem
bered."
WITH THE BLOCKADING FLEET,
OFF SANTIAGO, June 8, via Mole St.
Nicholas, Jane 9.â Lieutenant Hobson
and his heroic companions in the ex
ploit of sinking the collier Merrimac at j
the entrance to the harbor of Santiago
will not be exchanged for some time.
To-day Admiral Cervera sent a flag I
of truce to Admiral Sampson with a I
message that the prisoners were in the !
hands of the military authorities and
that their case had been referred by
tlie military Governor of Santiago to
Governor General Blanco. The plan of
exchange submitted by Admirul Samp- j
son to Admiral Cevera is thus tempo
rarily frustrated.

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, JUNE 10, 1898.
FALL OF
SANTIAGO
IMMINENT
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, "June 9.
The war situation to-night may be
thus briefly summarized: Fifteen thou
sand regulars and ten thousand volun
teers under the command of General
Shafter are en route for Santiago,
where they are expected to arrive on
Sunday night. General Blanco is now
totally isolated from the world; the last
cable has been cut and the cable ends
are attached to buoys. In a day or two
the United States ship Mayflower will
have been converted Into a floating
cable station, and daily reports from
Sampson and Shafter may be expected.
The Porto Rico expedition is expected
to sail from Fernandino, Florida, with
in ten days or two weeks. Either Gen
eral Coppinger or Fitzhugh Lee will
lead the expedition, and will be made
military Governor.
The report from San Francisco that
the Charleston, instead of proceeding
to Manila to Dewey's aid, will stop at
the Ladrones and take possession of
those islands is not true. The Charles
ton will not rest until she reaches Ma
nila, for she carries ammunition which
Admiral Dewey needs as soon as it can
reach him.
The military successes of Agulnaldo,
chief of the Insurgents, axe encourag-
Ing, and the administration is hopeful
that Manila may be taken before our
troops arrive. There is some fear, how
ever, that the insurgents, fired by their
success and in the absence of American
troops may commit excesses which may
place this Government in an embar
rassing situation before the great pow
ers of Europe. For this reason, if for
no other, the Charleston. Monterey,
Monadnock and Bennington. as well
as the troopships, will be hurried to
Manila. After Manila is taken will
be time enough to think of capturing
the Ladrones or the Carolines, say the
officials.
Stories of the appearance of myster
ious warships in Cuban waters floated
through the Navy Department during
the day. The officers quickly con
demned them, declaring that If the
boats were Spanish they were nothing
more than some unarmed launches, and
not to be feared by any number of
transports convoyed by such fine gun
boats as the Helena and Bancroft. But
when these stones reached the War
Department they were received with
a different spirit. Nothing is more
helpless in warfare than an unarmed
transport full of soldiers. She would
fall an easy victim to the smallest gun

SCHLEY ARRANGED
TO SECURE THIS
INFORMATION
Complete List and Location of the Spanish
Warships Furnished to the American
Commodore.
OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Saturday, June 4 (via Kingston, Jamaica, Monday, June 6,
9 a. m.). â After driving the Spanish fleet at Santiago de Cuba into a more protected position in the
harbor by the bombardment of Tuesday, May 31, Commodore Schley opened communication with
the insurgents eighteen miles from Santiago, to the east.
They were urged to obtain, if possible, the names and numbers of the vessels of the fleet in
side the harbor, as the contour of the land at the entrance made it impossible to accurately deter
mine by a view from the American fleet just how many vessels of the Spanish squadron were
therein.
On Friday afternoon Lieutenant Sharp of the Vixen went to the
place of rendezvous and received from the insurgents a map of the
harbor, showing the entire Cape Verde fleet, with the exception of the
destroyer Terror, inside and close up to the city under the protection
of the guns mounted on Blanco battery, at the northern extremity of
the harbor.
The ships there, according to this chart, are the Cristobal Colon,
the Viscaya, the Almirante Oquendo, the Maria Teresa and the Reina
Mercedes, all cruisers of the first class and heavily armored, together
with three torpedo-boats.
The definiteness of this information naturally gave Commodore
Schley great satisfaction.
With Admiral Sampson's arrival on Wednesday, June I, the blockade was much strength
ened and the plans to starve the city, its troops and the enemy's fleet were pushed vigorously.
Just how long Santiago can stand besieging is a matter of conjecture. The country about
the city is unproductive and mountainous, and the insurgent camps are so close that there is
little or no communication between the city and its environs. The railway service is not carried to
a distance much beyond ten miles from the town.
Since Sunday last, May 29, when Cervera's squadron was penned up by the flying squad
ron under Commodore Schley, nothing has gone in, and the auxiliary cruiser St. Paul captured
about 4000 tons of coal consigned to the port.
It is thoroughly believed that only a short time will be needed to bring Santiago to a starva
tion basis. Naturally the fleet has a supply, perhaps for two months, but the Spanish soldiery cannot
be sustained on this.
An important fact was learned to-day from the insurgents on shore, with whom communi
cation has been opened up. There are not 20.000 soldiers, as has been stated, in this part of the
province of Santiago de Cuba, but only about 6000. Even these are badly fed and much disheart
ened.
weakness In this respect, are loth to
undertake to cross the Florida Straits
until. these disagreeable visitors have
been removed from the pathway.
Without respect to the character of
the strange craft that are said to be
dodging the blockaders at Havana they
will be removed from the scene of ac
tion in short notice, as it is understood
that Sampson has been acquainted with
the situation and will be expected to
redeem his promise to provide safe con
duct to the army when called upon.
He has an ample force to conduct the
operations at Santiago to a successful
Issue and still spare vessels of any
power desirable for use in the Florida
straits.
It was pointed out to-day by a naval
officer that the admiral, sijice the ar
rival of the marine battalion on the
Panther, has at his disposal what he
may regard as a sufficient force of men
to capture Santiago, even before the
troops arrive. The 800 marines on the
Panther, added to the marines pre
viously with the fleet, would make a
total of about 1500 men. Without im
pairing the efficiency of his ships Ad
miral Sampson could spare 1000 blue-
Jackets for a landing party, and, with
this total force of 1500, if the insurgents,
who have been armed by the United
States Government, do their Bhare, it
seems possible for Sampson to capture
Santiago at short notice.
There seems to be a very decided
air of expectation this afternoon among
the officials who are acquainted with
the Government's plans in the cam
paign that almost warranted a conclu
sion that an engagement of some kind
was expected to-day.

WAR REVENUE
BILL SOON TO
BECOME A LAW
Passed by the House as
Amended by the
Conferees.
Senate Will Follow Suit and After
July 1 Uncle Sam Will Collect.
Articles to Be Taxed.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 9.
After five hours devoted to the con
sideration of the bill to enable volun
teers to vote in Congressional elections,
the conference report on the war rev
enue bill was presented to the House
to-day. Consideration waa interrupted
by a recess to 8 o'clock this evening, at
which hour the report was taken up
again and after three hours' debate, in
volving a wide range of subjects and
some sensational features, it was voted
upon and adopted, 154 to 107. The elec
tion measure will be disposed of to
morrow, immediately after the meeting
of the House. The Hawaiian annexa
tionists made a strong fight to get the
election bill out of the way, to prevent
its going over to to-morrow as priv
ileged and likely to postpone another
day their intended effort to force con
sideration of the annexation resolutions
in the House.
A very strong effort will be made to
secure a vote in the Senate to-morrow
before adjournment on the war revenue
bill so that it may go to the President
this week. Many Senators believe that
the effort will be successful.
When the House met after the recess
Dingley, addressing himself to the re
port, spoke of the urgent necessity for
the passage of a war revenue and the
resulting necessity for a speedy action in
conference and that of compromise. He
said the great ends which the House has
set out to accomplish were the raising of
approximately $175,000,000 from taxation
and from $400,000,000 to $600,000,000 from
other sources. These ends wuuld be se
cured through the bill as reported from
conference, and while the concessions j
made by the House conferees were in some;
'instances personally distasteful to him,!
he felt that they had been, without the
violation of any great principle, advo
cated by the House and without mitigat
ing against the accomplishment of the
great ends originally contemplated by the
inauguration of the war revenue legisla
tion. Diagley said the House conferees
made no effort to eliminate the tax on
tea, owing to the decisive vote by which
the Senate had incorporated it and be
cause the new crop -was just about to ar
rive; stocks on hand were very low and
the consumption in the country amount
ed to'li'tO.OXKj.lKX) pounds annually. Relative
to the coinage of silver bullion, Dingley
explained that the provision would re
sult ultimately In an increase of circula
tion outstanding by the amount of the
present seigniorage, or about $42,000,000,
the provision declaring explicitly that the j
.coinage should proceed at the rate of not i
less than $1,500,000 per month, if the dol
lars should be tisod for th.- redemption of
silver certificates, which, when redeemed, I
should bo canceled. The provision was
not materially different from the law of
,1890.
Further digression from the bill was in
dulged in by Swanson (D.) of Virginia,
who very vigorously dissented from any I
Inclination to turn the war into one of ag- {
grcssion to end with this country holding
great colonial possessions. He attacked
then the bond and other features of the
bill, notably the tobacco bill. Swanson I
took occasion to criticize the administra- j
tion in its conduct of the war and panic- I
-ularly did he antagonize the pending bill |
conducive to interests of monopolists and
the very rich.
The speech brought from Grosyenor
(R.) of Ohio an impassioned and highly
sensational response. Ho said: "Had
Sagasta, had Blanco, had Cervera been
given an opportunity to make a speech on
this occasion, they would not have made j
so incendiary an appeal against the prose- ]
cution of this war as the gentleman from
Virginia has uttered. I denounce his un
patriotic purposes, I denounce his un
patriotic and untruthful utterances."
Swanson, In a two-minute reply, said: |
"The only reason I can give for the un
fair, unjust, unpatriotic and untrue per
sonal attack upon me is that the speaker
is in such a condition that he does not
know whether he is fighting .the Confed
erate or Spanish forces." He then pro
ceeded with an eloquent defense of his
district. Later Swanson again secured the
floor and declared his belief that the Ohio,
member would never have made the
"brutal attack had he been sober."
Grosvenor, being again recognized, de
clared he had attacked the sentiment of
the Virginian's speech and not the per
sonality of the member. He denied hav
ing referred to the .latter's district as
"contemptible" and eaid he had used the
word "contestable." This declaration
SANTIAGO DE CUBA FROM THE HARBOR.
was greeted by hisses and gen
eral protests from the Democrats
and corroborative expressions from
the Republicans. He denounced Swan
son's insinuation that he (Gros
venor) was not sober as a "weapon
which no honorable opponent would use"
in a debate such as t^e one in progress.
The Democrats jeereu and the Repub
licans applauded the denunciation.
Following the Grosvenor-Swanson epi
sode Hill of Connecticut, Henderson of
lowa, Moody of Massachusetts, Payne of
New York and McMillin of Tennessee
spoke.
Hill declared that he would vote against
the bill because of the coinage provision,
embodying, as he believed, a giving of
some new life to the dead issue. But the
other Republicans who addressed the
House contended that it would affect no
more than the law at present provided
in the matter of silver coinage and was
not open to serious objection.
The vote on the conference report was
taken at 11 o'clock, resulting: Ayes 154
noes lfiT.
The Republicans who voted against the
adoption of the conference report on the
war revenue bill were: Brewster. Henry
of Connecticut, Hill, Littauer. Melntire
The Democrats who voted for the re
port were: Cummings, Driggs, Fitzger
ald. McAleer. McClellan.
At 11:35 o'clock the House adjourned.

Ends.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, June 9. â The platform
adopted this forenoon at the State Con
vention'of Prohibitionists demands the
suppression of the beverage liquor traf
fic by laws enforced by a party pledged
to this end.
It was set forth that the right of
suffrage should have no other qualifi
cation save intelligence and sobriety,
nor should one-half of the people be
disfranchised in the name of law and
kept so throu 'i the untiring efforts of
the saloon against mothers, wives and
daughters.
The platform favors the hearty sup
port of the Government in the present
war and pledges itself to this end.
It holds that the currency problem
has been largely produced by brewers
and distillers, who, through the sa
loons, draw from the workingman's
products silver which, changed into
gold, is piled up uselessly or shipped
away.
It protests against the frequent tariff
changes as greatly to the detriment of
the country's business interests and fa
vors a tariff commission.
It also favors an extension of the in
itiative and referendum principle, now
only having an advisory or limited in
fluence in lawmaking.
Civil service rules should cover all
subordinates, but changes should not be
so made as to favor unjustly the party
in power.
Our laws should discourage land mo
nopolies by individuals or corporations.
The platform favors a legal day of
rest and good sanitary and moral con
ditions in factories, public schools and
colleges.
It likewise favors the construction,
ownership and management of the Nic
araguan canal by the general Govern
ment.
It holds for Government and munici
pal ownership or control of natural re
sources and means of transportation
and communication and declares
against trusts and other aggregations
of capital.
Upon the unanimous adoption of this
platform the convention broke up, sing
ing "Praiso God, from "Whom All -Bless
ings Flow." i n&

DE CUBA, June 5 (via Port Antonio,
Jamaica, June 6, delayed in transmis
sion). â A launch from the cruiser Al
mirante Oquendo came out of the har
bor flying a flag of truce this morning.
A boat from the lowa, which was lying
nearest, went to meet her. Two officers
of the Almirante Oquendo came on
board, and a very dignified, stately offi
cer on the deck of the lowa received
them and inquired their business. They
said they came out under the impres
sion that a white flag was flying from
the lowa and supposed the battleship
wanted to surrender.
An investigation showed several
things on the lowa which might have
caught their eyes, one of which was a
garment of Captain Evans hanging on
a line. The matter was exnlained, and
the Oquendo's launch returned with
many apologies. One man on the
launch made the significant remark,
"I am glad we did not have to wait
around as we are very short of fresh
water for our boilers."
There was a touching feature in the
preliminaries to the action on the lowa.
Most of the officers' rooms are not pro

tion is the state room of Surgeon Cran

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 9.â At to-day's
session of the Senate Carter of Mon
tana, in connection with the rejection
by the Government ef the steamship
Centennial as a transport, made some
ugly charges against the ship owners
on the Pacific Coast. He said they had
been endeavoring to hold up the Gov
ernment and compel it to pay inordin
ate and extraordinary prices for ships
to be used to transport troops to the
Philippines.
Perkins of California denied the
statements of Carter,' declaring that
the vessel owners of San Francisco
had placed their ships at the disposal
of the Government at a rate fully 50
per cent less than they usually received
for them.
Lodge of Massachusetts made some
sensational disclosures concerning the
disposition of the money appropriated
by Congress a short time ago in pay
ment of the claim of the book concern
of the Methodist Episcopal Church
South. He introduced a resolution di
recting the Claims Committee to make
an investigation of the matter and re
port to the Senate what, if any, action
could be taken.
Lodge said that lobbyists were to re
ceive $100,800 of the $288,000 appropri
ated.

day inshore, which either represents all
that is left of the Spanish torpedo-boat
in the attack on it by the fleet on
j Friday night, or else shows that the
Spaniard launched it from its tube at
one of our ships and missed. On this
point opinion is divided, but the fact
that the Porter saw a second torpedo
which she could not recover makes
many think the boat was destroyed, al
though the point is made that if she
struck and sunk she would probably
carry her torpedoes to the bottom with,
her.
Unfortunately the Spanish torpedo ig
of German make and will not fit our
tubes and cannot be returned to them.
The belief that the Spanish boat was
sunk by the shots from the New York
and New Orleans is strengthened by
the fact that the Spanish kept signaling
all last night, presumably to locate a
torpedo-boat in case she had been cut
off from entering, but had managed to
slip through the fleet in the darkness.
At intervals during the night the light
over Morro Castle, which had been,
dark since the American fleet arrived,
flashed out brilliantly and at various
points along the shore flares were
burned.
The belief exists that an attempt to
learn something of the fate of the tor
pedo-boat was the real reason for the
appearance of the Oquendo's launch
with a flag of truce this morning. The
Spanish officers probably thought that
if the torpedo-boat was wrecked ami
the men captured, something would
j have been said, especially after Ad-
I miral Cervera's courtesy regarding the
Merrimac Incident. The lowa's officer
who met the launch said nothing on
this point, because he knew nothing
definite, and the Spaniards asked no
questions. If the torpedo-boat was
sunk all on board must have been
drowned.
pension bills and several measures
from the general calendar, were
passed.
SPANISH SHIPS
REPORTEDNEAR HAVANA^
Humors That the Enemy's War Ves
sels Are Lying in Wait for
American Transports.
KEY WEST, June 9.â Four suspicious
looking vessels, thought to be Spanish
warships, are or have been attempting
to elude the blockading squadron off
Havana and to enter that port. When
last seen, on the night before last, they
were in Nicholas Channel, about eighty
miles off Havana and heading in that
direction.
A Government tug from Cardenas
joined the American fleet off Havana
yesterday afternoon, bringing a mes
sage for Commodore Watson from an
auxiliary gunboat.
This was to the effect that on Tues
day night the gunboat sighted four ves
sels, thought to be a battleship, two
cruisers and a torpedo boat, between
Salt Cayo and Padre del Cruz light. The
gunboat "followed them and when with
in speaking distance hoisted the private
fleet signal. The strangers answered
with throe-mast head lights, which was
not the required signal, and immediate
ly thereafter put out all their lights.
The gunboat cruised after the stran
gers for two or three miles, once ap
proaching within 2000 yards, but even
tually abandoned the chase and re
ported to the nearest ship of the United
States fleet.
The commander of the gunboat
which followed the four vessels says he
is satisfied that they were Spanish
warships either trying to get into Ha
vana or lying in wait for transports.
The affair, however, is involved, in
doubt.
The British cruiser Talbot left Ha
vana on Tuesday, and she may have
been one of the vessels sighted by the
gunboat.
It is suspected that Spanish ships
may be lying in wait for army trans
ports in hopes of sinking or capturing
some, but they are well protected by
the Indiana, Helena and Bancroft.
Persistent rumors credited by naval
officers of high rank here are in cir
culation to the effect that three Span
ish warships have succeeded in forcing
their way Into Havana harbor. One re
port says that on â  battleship and two
cruisers have entered the harbor.TUBERCULOSIS

DR. J. R. MURPHY'S PAPER
EXCITES THE PHYSICIANS TO
ENTHUSIASM.
The Young Chicago Surgeon Declares
His Discovery Infallible Un
less the Lunps Are GonÂ»
Entirely.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, June 9.â The feature of the
fifty-first annual convention of the
American Medical Association, now in
session in this city, was a remarkable
address at the forenoon session by Dr.
J. R. Murphy of Chicago who. although
still a young man, is recognized as one
of the greatest living surgeons. Dr.
Murphy's paper was entirely upon the
subject of the lungs, but with special
reference to the discovery by him of a
cure for consumption, or tuberculosis
of the lungs. The discovery was made
public to-day for the first time and its
announcement aroused great enthusi
asm among the assembled physicians.
Dr. Murphy's new treatment is based
upon the fact that the sore spots of the
lungs have a natural tendency to heal,
the healing process being retarded or
prevented by the constant expansion
of the tissue in breathing. The treat
ment consists In the introduction of
pure nitrogen into the lur cavity
through a hypode ...ic needle. The ac
tion of the nitrogen compresses the
lung and gives an entire rest. After
a few weeks the nitrogen is withdrawn
and air admitted the lung expanding
to its usual dimensions. If it be found
that a perfest cure has not been ef
fected the nitrogen can aram be used.
The treatment of tuberculosis thus by
means of compression is not a new
theory, but the application is new.
Dr. Murphy announced that five pa
tients whom he had treated in this
manner were cured in four to eight
weeks. He declares that unless the
lung is entirely gone a permanent cure
can be effected. On his return to Chi
cago he will use his treatment on 230
consumptive patients in the Cook
County Hospital.
Columbus, Ohio, was chosen as the
next place of meeting. The following
officers were elected:
President. Joseph McDowell Mathews,

British Consulate Secre
tary Maltreated.
IMPRISONED IN A DUNGEON
BY ORDER OF iBE GOVERNOR
GENERAL.
Suspected of Having Given Ameri
cans Information as to the
Mining of San Juan
Harbor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 9.â A copyrighted
special from St. Thomas, Danish West
Indies, says:
Suspected of having furnished the
United States with information of the
mining of San Juan harbor, Walter
Bett, secretary of the British consulate
at that port, has received his passports
and been banished from Porto Rico by
order of Governor-General Macias. Mr.
Bett was also imprisoned in a dungeon
for fifty-six hours, and during that time
was subjected to gross maltreatment.
British Consul General Crawford has
| made a formal protest to his Govern
; ment and serious international compli-
I cations are imminent.
The day after the bombardment of
' San Juan by the ships of Admiral
Sampson, General Macias caused an
extensive system of mines to be in
stalled in the outer harbor, in antici
i pation of a return of the ships and a
! subsequent bombardment. Although
; the greatest care and secrecy was ob
served by the Spanish in mining the
I harbor the details of the work were
conveyed to Consul General Hanna and
; he is now making an extensive report
I of the operations to the Navy Depart
i ment.
In some way General Macias learned
of this and, as the British consulate
has been guarding American Interests
in Porto Rico since the withdrawal of
Mr. Hanna, he at once suspected that
Englishmen had conveyed the news to
the United States officials. He per
emptorily summoned thirty British
subjects before him and put them
through a searching examination, after
which several of them were cast into
prison for twenty-four hours. Upon
Secretary Bett General Macias vis
ited most of his wrath.
The P.ritish official was practically
accused of having revealed the mili
tary operations, and was dragged off
to a dungeon. There he was kept for
fifty-six hours in the face of the pro
tests of Consul-General Crawford.
When he was released Mr. Bett was
presented with his passports and or
dered out of Porto Rico. He has left
for St. Thomas.
The military plans of General Macias
were not disclosed to Mr. Hanna by
British officials or subjects, but by

SENOR SAGASTA SO DECLARES
THE PREMIER ALSO SPEAKS OF
PROBABLE PEACE.
Says the United States Were the Ag
gressors, and It Is for Them
to State When Peace
Shall Prevail.
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
MADRID. May 25.â The correspond
ent here of the Associated Press has
had an interview with Senor Sagasta,
the president of the Council of Minis
ters, at his office in the Presidency.
The correspondent said: "Sir, I want to
ask you your views on five points. I
shall keep the fifth in reserve, as it is
in the nature of a request; the other
four are: The Cabinet difficulty said to
I exist between Senors Gamazo and Pu
igcerver; the real reason for Senor
Leon y Castillo's return to Paris; the
truth as to the foreign relations of
Spain â is she or is she not seeking al
liances? and what are the prospects of
peace?"
Senor Sagasta replied:
"The second, third and fourth all
somewhat bear cm the same subject
foreign relations. At the present deli
cate Juncture I do not feel justified in
speaking thereon. With respect to
peace prospects information could be
more easily obtained in Washington
than in Madrid, since here there was
no desire for war. Spain has been
driven into war in defense of her rights
and national existence. The United
States were the aggressors and it is
for them to say when peace shall pre
vail.
"As regards the Cabinet discussion
the question between Senors Gamazo
and Puigcerver was purely an aca
demic one, and I have sufficient confi
dence in their patriotism to say that
they will not discuss it so as to bring
about disunion in the Cabinet at a
time when the country is in danger.
Such scholastic differences of opinion
will undoubtedly be left for discussion
in quieter times.
"No," the Premier added, "I am sure
you will find rumor is wrong in sup
posing there is any danger of a Cab
inet crisis arising on this score."
When the Premier had paused after
his last remark he smiled and said:
"Now, what about the fifth subject on
which you wished to- speak? A favor
you wanted, was it not?"
"It is," the correspondent replied,
"and a very great one. It is no less
than to ask, Can your Excellency ob
tain for me, as a Journalist, an Inter
view with her Majesty, the Queen Re
gent?"
The Premier opened his eyes with
surprise and said: "What you ask Is
impossible. I quite appreciate the good
intentions you have, but were the
Queen of Spain to grant one Inter
view it would be difficult to refuse
granting others. Her Majesty has con
sistently refused to see Journalists in
interviews for the press and Is deter
mined to maintain that resolution. '
The correspondent thanked the Pre
mier for the kindness he had shown
him. The Premier listened with court
ly dignity and, as the door to which
he led the correspondent closed, the
Prime Minister of Spain remarked:
"May you go with God."

SAYS REVOLT
WAS BACKED
BY UNCLE SAM
President of San Domingo
Charges America Was
Behind Jiminez.
But Coolly Declares He Will Not
Make Any Claim Against the
United States.
CAPE HATTIEN, June 9.âPresi
dent Heureaux of the Republic of Do
minica believes he has discovered proof
that the steamer Fanita, formerly of
the Clyde line, which was used by
Senors Jiminez and Morales in their
unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the
Dominican Government, left the United
States with the countenance of the
American Government under a mere
pretense of taking munitions of war to
Cuba.
President Heureaux arrived here to
day on the Dominican gunboat Restau
racion, about noon, from Great Inagua,
and was interviewed by the corre
spondent of the Associated Press.
General Heureaux said he had been
warned that Jiminez was conspiring
against htm by an official whom Jim
inez offered a post. He showed the
correspondent notes he had made of
the results of his investigation and also
a bundle of incriminating papers taken
from prisoners and from the bodies of
the slain at Monte Cristi.
It was in this connection that he de
veloped the striking fact of his belief

ENGLISHMEN IN FAVOR OF IT
THEY CARRY ASSURANCES TO
EMBASSADOR HAY.
Men Largely Interested in the De
velopment of the Islands Most
Anxious for Uncle Sam
to Govern.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, June I.â Whatever may. be
the policy of the United Btates toward
the Philippine Islands the English capi
talists whose investments give them the
right to speak upon the conditions and
needs of the islands are of one mind.
Delegations of London men represent
ing some of the most important in
terests in the Philippines have called
upon Embassador Hay to urge him to
make representations to his Govern
ment of their desire that the United
States retain permanent .possession of
the Philippines. They are agreed in the
belief that with the guarantee of a
stable government the Philippines
would become a richer and even more
desirable possession than they now fire.
They are agreed also that the Spanish
rule is one which discourages business
enterprise and repels capital and that
the legitimate profits of their business
are mostly absorbed, by direct and in
direct bribes to Spanish officials.
Without liberal investments to secure ;
the favor of the ruling class, these gen- j
tlemen tell the Embassador that no
business operations can be conductf-.i
under the regime of Spain. The position
of the Philippine capitalists is one
which prevents them from making a
public declaration of their views.
Should the islands remain under .Span- |
lsh sovereignty that Government might
make conditions burdensome for busi
ness men who were on record as desir
ing a change and who had made revela
tions about Spanish misrule. They can
make known their desires only through
secret diplomatic channels as they have
The president of an important Philip
pine company having its principal of
fice In London, who presented a state
ment to the Embassador, discussed the
question with a representative of the
Associated Press, but only on condition
that his name be withheld. He gave
the usual recital of extortion by the
officials who come from Spain to these
Islands as they go to Cuba, with the
sote purpose of acquiring as much
money as possible in the shortest time.
He ridiculed the suggestion that the
Philippine insurgents could be induced
by the Spaniards to form an alliance
against the United States. The natives,
he declared, would welcome any power
which would relieve them from the
domination of Spain. He did not, how
ever, seem to place much confidence in
the good faith of the revolutionists and
incidentally remarked that he had
knowledge that more than one native
insurrection had teen inspired and pro
moted by Spanish officials' for the In
creased revenues which would come to
them through the transportation of
troops into the island to suppress the
Insurrection.
Under proper treatment, the natives,
although consisting of several races,
would be entirely tractable. The great
est difficulties encountered In managing
the islands would come from the relig
ious orders which had been accustomed
to squeeze the natives and had accum
ulated much valuable property. The
present Insurrection was as much an
uprising against the church as against
the government, and was conducted by
a secret society which had been organ
ized to oppose the priests, a sort of free
masonry, which had spread throughout
the islands. As an Instance of Spanish
Colonial government he said there was
but one road outside of Manila in thÂ«
Island. The entire absence of public
works of all sorts was a great check to
business enterprises.
Careful investigation by the most ef
ficient engineers had provofl that the 1
cold deposits of ths Philippines were >
that the Fanita left the United States
with the countenance of the American
Government under a mere pretense of
sailing for Cuba.
President Heureaux coolly, but as if
he enjoyed a capital story, told how the
revolution was nipped in the bud and
how he had summarily executed nearly
all the prisoners, reserving those who
he thought might be used in obtaining
further information about the conspir
acy.
He described the flight of Jiminez as
"cowardly," and he said distinctly that
he could make no claim against the
United States Government, believing
that the Government had been misled,
through no fault of its own. More
over,' he said, he recognized the fu
tility of a feeble state like his own of
making a demand which he could not
enforce against so powerful a neighbor.
The papers seized, however, seemed to
show, he declared, that the leader of
the expedition had arranged to notify
the Americans by a secret code immed
iately if the movement was successful.
They also showed, he continued, that
Jiminez visited officials in Washington
frequently during the six weeks that
elapsed after he left Haytl.
amgngr the richest in the world and un
der conditions favorable to the develop
ment he was sure that the islands
would surpass Australia and South Af
rica as a gold country.
In conclusion this gentleman said the
American Government need not be de
terred by fear of the climate from in
vading the Philippines- with unseasoned
troops. During a residence of ten years
he had known but one epidemic of dis
ease and that was not a serious one.

PLAUDIT FINDS
HIS WATERLOO
Han dOr Wins the La
tonia Derby.
CONLEY RIDES THE VICTOR
GRAND CONTEST FROM START
TO FINISH.
Nothing Like It Since the Days of
Tenbroeck â World's Mile
and a Half Record
Broken.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, June 9.â The mighty
has fallen. Plaudit, the greatest three
year-old of the year, met his first defeat
of the season to-day in the Latonia
Derby, after one of the grandest con
tests ever witnessed on the Western
turf. Han dOr is the colt that lowered
the colors of the Madden pride, and in
doing it he also lowered the world's .
record for a mile and a half. Ten thou- j
eand people cheered Han dOr as he
came down the stretch like a wild !
horse and looking every Inch a winner, j
Martin was whipping Plaudit and rid
ing like a demon. A hundred yards \
from the wire Plaudit made a gallant
effort to come up, but it was of no use,
his speed and endurance were gone and j
Han dOr crossed the wire a winner by
three lengths, amid great excitement in
the grand stand and loud cheers from
the hundreds of stable hands In the I
field.
No race run at Latonia ever created
more enthusiasm and every horseman
on the track pronounced it the grand
est race since the days of Tenbroeck.
The track, contrary to expectations,
â¢was lightning fast and all conditions
favored good time being made. The
race from a time standpoint was a
most remarkable one. There were but
two starters and little time was lost in
getting them away from the post. The
pair went away heads together and
Han dOr at once set out to make his
own pace. The first half mile was
covered in 50 seconds, the six furlongs
in 1:14^4, seven furlongs in I:27 Vz, mile
in 1:40*4, mile and an eighth in 1:54 and
the mile and a quarter in 2:O"Vi, the
final time being 2:32V6, which is a
quarter of a second better than any
previous record.
Plaudit could never overtake Han
dÂ« >r from the start. The latter led by
three lengths until the stretch was
reached, when Plaudit tried to make his
run, but the killing pace had told on
him and Han dOr won in handy
fashion.
Jockey Conley, who rode the winner,
was surrounded by a large crowd after
he dismounted and was carried to the
scale room on the shoulders of several j
enthusiastic friends.
Plaudit was always 1 to 7 in the bet
ting, while as good as 5 to 1 could be
had on Han d' Or. The Derby Is worth
$5009 to the winner, which is the prop
erty of George A. Singerly. Results:

SAUSALITO'S
POOLROOMS
A New Concern Open
for Business.
CLOSED BY TOWN MARSHAL
WILL MAKE A TEST IN THE
COURTS.
Harvey and Harrison's Monopoly
Threatened and a Legal
Battle Royal Is
Expected.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAT'SALTTO, June 9.â The poolroom
question has reached a critical point. If
Buckley's "nephew," Harrison, and Joe
Harvey are to retain their supremacy as
monopolists they must marshal their
forces and prepare for a battle royal in
the courts of law.
Yesterday morning a rival poolroom
opened on Water street, Just opposite
Harrison's quarters, in the rear of the
Buffalo Hotel, and printed notices scat
tered round the town and on the ferry
boats announced that Glenn, Boyer &
Humphreys were in the betting arena.
These dealers were engaged in selling
pools at San Mateo until the authorities
decided that the resorts there must go.
The intention of the trio in transferring
their business to this place was to see
whether or not the Board of Trustees
has the right to issue licenses. If the
proper tribunals decide otherwise they
probably intend to assist in running the
town "wide open" as long as the other
dealers are permitted to remain. If, on
the other hand, it is concluded the board
has such right, then pressure will be
brought to bear with the object in view
of securing a license.
Glenn, Boyer & Humphreys have a pe
tition for a license now before the board,
which decided at a meeting held last
evening to give it due consideration. Ac
cordingly early in the afternoon Marshal
Hannon served a notice on the rival trio
that they must "shut up shop" until the
board issued its ukase. After a confer
ence they agreed to do this.
Then it was that the fine hand of Henry
Schwartz began its work. Attorney Hep
burn Wilkins of San Rafael was tele
graphed for by Schwartz and came to
Sausalito on the 3:40 p. m. train. Schwartz
was waiting to receive him. and the two
went uptown, earnestly conversing.
It is reported that the original intention
was to issue a license only to William H.
Harrison, the nephew of ex-Boss Buck
ley, but Harvey exerted too strong a
pressure to be resisted and also secured
a license. Now the entrance of Schwartz
on the scene presents a new factor to be
dealt with. It is commonly expected that
a "warm time" all around will be the re
sult."

SHOT TO DEATH WHILE
RESISTING ARREST
Angel Soto, a Mexican, While Crazy
Drunk, Is Killed by Two San
Jose. Officers.
SAN JOSE, June 9.â Angel Soto, a Mexi
can, was shot and killed this evening by
Policemen Hughes and Bateman while
resisting arrest. About 7:30 o'clock word
was received at the police station that
a man was chasing women and children
out of a house with a knife on Orchard
street, near Pond. When the police, ar
rived the man refused to surrender and
made a lunge at Bateman with a knife.
The officer broke his club over his assail
ant and then he and Hughes fired several
shots to frighten him. Boto, who had
evidently' been drinking, still made an at
tempt to kill the officers, and both fired
directly at him. Two bullets penetrated
his heart.
Soto was about 30 years of age, and
about a year ago moved to San Francisco
with his wife. A short time after she
ran away to Santa Barbara with another
man and Soto returned here. He had
served several terms in the County Jail
for petty offenses.

The League of the Sacred Heart asso

LOS ANGELES
WATER FIGHT
Shall the City Have Its
Own Plant?
SOLE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION
SCHEMES TO DEFEAT THE
PROJECT.
Mayor Snyder and Councilman
Hutchinson on the Alert and
Working for the Pub
lic Interest.
Special Dispatch to The. Call.
LOS ANGELES, June 9.â The water
question Is again becoming the sole
topic of discussion in municipal gov
ernment matters and within sixty days
its settlement will be effected in this
far â the point will be decided as to
whether or not municipal operation of
the plant will be obtained.
A strong effort is being made to com
plicate and confuse the public mind by
injecting into the fight at this juncture
a proposition for partial ownership by
the city of the lighting plant. Mayor
Snyder and Councilman Hutchinso-n
are thoroughly posted on this scheme
>and have taken a bold stand against
it. They state that when the water
question is disposed of then they will
favor the city purchasing the full and
complete lighting plant and operating
the same not only for the city, but for
private customers who may be best
served by the city's plant.
In a few days there will be a Joint
meeting of the City Council, directors
of the water company and Mayor Sny
der to discuss matters and make one
last effort to arrive at an understand
ing. Very little hope is held out that
anything can be effected.
E. Woltman, representing Kessler &
Co., the New York bankers, who have
made a proposition to the city to take
the present plant clear of all legal dif
ficulties and operate it, has returned
from New York to renew and further
explain what his principal will do to
secure thirty years' lease. During
the next six weeks there will be some
busy times here in the water imbroglio
and the outcome cannot be predicted.
SAILED WITHOUT PAPERS.
For Neglecting to Properly Clear
From Kingston a Steamer
Is Seized.
PHILADELPHIA, June 9.â Captain
Aarhuus of the German steamer
Srhleswig, which has arrived here from
Kingston, Jamaica, was given a hearing
before Collector of the Port Thomas on
a charge that he violated the maritime
laws in attempting to enter this port
without first having obtained clearance
papers from the customs officers of
Kingston. After hearing his case Col
lector Thomas decided that the captain
should make a deposit of $5000 for his
liability, pending final action.
Captain Aarhuus refused to deposit the
sum, and the case was referred to Wash
ington for final action. Meanwhile the
Schleswig is In the custody of the cus
toms authorities.
When the agents of the Schleswig ap
plied to Consul Dent at Kingston for a
bill of health the Consul's office had
been closed for the night, and the Schles
wig sailed early the next morning with
out the necessary papers. This offense
is punishable by a fine of $5000.
TWO FISHERMEN DROWNED.
Their Boat Capsized in Suisun Say
During a Fierce Gale.
DUTTONS LANDING, Cal.. June 9.â
In the heavy gale which prevailed here
last night the fishing boat of George Bal
abaca and John Morisano was capsized
on what is known as the "Flats," a por
tion of Suisun Bay, and near Grizzly Isl
and. Both men were drowned. Search
ing parties are out, but as the bodies have
not yet been found it is supposed that the
high tide carried them into the tules. The
men were both Greeks, and have long
been fishing near here.

Chinese Burn a Japan

RIOTERS RAMPART AT SHASHI
MIKADO SENDS WARSHIPS TO
THE SCENE.
All Foreign Residences Along the
Yang-Tse Destroyedâ Reported
Murder of Three
Missionaries.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, June 9.â Oriental ad
vices are to the effect that China and
Japan are having trouble again. Com
plications have occurred in China, one
after another, and now the Japanese
consulate at Shashi has been burned
down.
It seems that rioters at Shashi raided
the Japanese consulate, set fire to the
building and also destroyed all foreign
residences along the river Yangtse. A
Shanghai dispatch says the rioters are
believed to have been instigated by
Chinese officials who were recently dis
charged from service. On receipt of the
news of the riot the Minister of the
Navy issued instructions to the com
manders of the cruiser Ta Kao at
Shanghai and the gunboat Maya at Sa
zecho to immediately proceed to the
scene of the disturbance for the protec
tion of the Japanese residents.
H. M. S. Esk has also been ordered
to the scene of the outrage.
A major in the Russian army ac
companied by a number of non-com
missioned officers has been negaged in
a topographical survey of Haamg Yong
and Kai Won, Korea. The party re
cently arrived at Wr.-nsan and is re
ported to have .committed gross out
rages on women and others along the
road. They murdered a Korean and
afterward proceeded to a police station
and killed one af the sergeants. After
this they attacked a church where a
French missionary lived, but were re
pulsed by the latter, who fired a pistol
at them.
It is reported that three missionaries
of the International Missionary Alli
ance have been murdered in the prov
ince of Bunan. The name of one of the
victims is given as Mr. Chapin, son of
a former missionary of the American
board.

CONFERENCE OF HEBREWS.
NEW YORK, June 9.â An Important
conference of members of the Jewish
faith of this country and Canada, which
may effect Important and radical
changes in that religion, Is sitting in the
Spanish and Portuguese synagogues
here. The conference is the outcome of
a great deal of discussion among the
orthodox Jews, who have fe'.t for some
time that too many of the younger ele
ment of the faith were slipping away.
The conference, it was said, may result
in a radical departure from some of the
observances of the Jewish faith that
have obtained for ages.

Troops at Richmond Will Be
Moved to the Reserv
ation.
Arrival at Oakland of the Fifty-First Regiment
of lowa Volunteers â Transports
for Manila.
On high moral grounds and for
sanitary reasons General Merriam,
XJ. S. A., commanding the Depart
ment of California, yesterday de
cided to abandon Camp Merritt at
the Bichmond District and place the
soldiers in camp on the Presidio res
ervation. The subject had been un
der consideration for several days
and engaged such earnest thought
that Dr. Lippincott of the medical de
partment was ordered to report on
the sanitary condition of the big
camp at Richmond.
The troops designated for the next
expedition to the Philippines will re
main at Camp Merritt until orders are
received by them to go aboard the
ships. Organizations listed for the
third and succeeding expeditions may
be transferred to the Presidio within
the next we. k
When the K^neral use of the Presidio
as a camping' ground was considered
by the military authorities the fact
"was taken Into consideration that the
reservation cmild not be made conven
ient for the uses desired unless light
and water corporations were granted
certain privileges. Officers have been
taugrlit by long experience that pri
intorests, once securing a foot
hold 'vi Government property, seldom
relinquish the advantages of occu
pancy. The civilian influence is pow
erful, as there is a. voting prestige be
hind it, while the military can only
protest. This branch of the subject re
ceived careful reflection, but the points
presented were not deemed of sufficient
weight to offset the advantages from a
THIRD EXPEDITION.
War Department Orders It to Leave on
or Before June 25.
The third expedition to Manila will sail from San Francisco two weeks
from to-morrow. The transports will be the Senator, City of Puebla and the
Ohio. Early yesterday morning, according to reliable advices from head
quarters, General Otis received a dispatch from the War Department
through General Merritt, informing him that the third expedition must
leave this port ten days after the departure of the second. From the fact
that the brigade formation at Camp Merritt is only temporary, it is very dif
ficult to say just what troops will compose the third expedition, but from a
prominent officer it was learned that the Seventh California. Thirteenth
Minnesota and Twentieth Kansas would certainly be among the troops se
l.-<tt-<i to >ro. These with additional troops will form a brigade, and will be
â¡landed by one of the three brigadier generals. The general impres
sion seems to be that General H. G. Otis will have the preference shown him
oyit Generals Miller and King.
military point of view which would re
sult from the encampment of the
troops on land wholly under the con
trol of the Government.
At Camp Merritt certain regulations
cannot be enforced without violating
the ordinance against closing the pub
lic streets. On the Presidio the mili
tary authority is absolute and unques
tioned. Regulations to exclude dis
reputable men and women may be en
forced. It was said by a prominent of
ficer yesterday: "We can exclude lewd
women from the camp on the Presidio
which we cannot do at the camp on the
Bay District."
It was ascertained last evening that
all the regiments to arrive will be en
camped on the Presidio, and as soon
as practicable the troops now at Camp
Merritt, not included In the next Ma
nila expedition, will be moved to the
reservation. Hereafter closer atten
tion will be paid to the observance of
sanitary rules.
The action of the medical department
of the army in taking steps to improve
the sanitary condition of Camp Merritt
mmendable and timely. If the
neglect obvious at Camp Merritt should
be repeated at Manila the results
might be appalling. The Call yester
day directed an expert examination to
be made of the camp and its drainage
facilities. Following Is the report of
the expert:
'< lamp Merritt Is without proper sew
erage faciliti'-s.
"The streets on the boundaries of the
camp have sewers. Those in what was
originally the Bay District track are
without sewers. The plan for caring
for the sewage of the camp consists
in the construction of vaults for closets
â four for each regiment. These are
dug ten or twelve feet In depth and
each day are filled partly with sand and
freely sprinkled with chloride of lime.
"In nearly every regiment the cook
tents are close against the vaults and
the stench arising from the latter is
quite noticeable. Small holes are sunk
in the ground near the kitchens into
which the dishwater and in many
casts the garbage of the camps are
dumped.
"The detail for disposing of the gar
bage seems wholly Inadequate, for in
many camps piles of garbage are In
evidence, notwithstanding the fact that
K:nl>age cans are provided for its re-
Ce "Camp Merritt is a city of 11,000 in
habitants, occupying one-tenth the
space ordinarily occupied by the same
number of civilians. The camp Is with
out sewerage facilities, and this in the
midst of homes is a subject for consid
eration by the health authorities."
Major General Merritt was a busy man
yesterday at headquarters. Department
of the Pacific. Whrn asked If he had re
ceived telegrams from the Secrt>tarv of
War urging hasty departure of the Phil
ippine, expeditionary' forces, he replied
that no such messages had been received.
The sailing orders, as announced In The
Call yesterday, have not been changed.
The squadron to soil next Wednesday
will consist of five ships.
Mnjnr General Merritt was the chief
pu*Ht at a dinner given at the Pactfic-
Vnion Club last evening, under the direc
tion of Mayor Phelan. The general de
clined a public banquet on the ground
that ho had not yet accomplished any
thing In the present war to Justify a pub
lic function in his honor. He remarked
to the ban'niPtlng committees that he
might fed like accepting a public dinner
on his return, provided that he accom
plished something at Manila. At the lit
tle affair last evening he met forty agree
able citizens of San Francisco. .Â» gen
tk-man who attended the dinner remarked
that it was "dignified and Impressive."
UNDER MARCHING ORDERS
Companies of the Sixth Califor
nia Stationed at Various
Points for Duty.
Orders were Issued yesterday by Major
***neral Merrlam, commanding the De
partment of California, assigning the
companies of the Sixth California Volun
teer Infantry, now at the Presidio, to va
rious points for duty. Company A, com
manded by Captain Charles Dasher, haa
gone to Alcatraz Island, relieving Bat
tery X of the Third United States Ar
tillery, which hag joined the artillery
corps at the Presidio. Company F,
which goes to Santa Cruz to-day to
guard tho powder works will be taken
up as a portion of the garrison at the
Presidio and will be supplied from that
post by monthly shipments by rail. A
full return of the company will be made
to the commanding officer of the Pre
sidio.
Lieutenant Colonel W. R. Johnson,
with Companies C and A, accompanied
by Captain C. A. Rogers, assistant sur
geon of the regiment, is assigned to duty
at Benicia Barracks and will proceed
thereto without delay. On the arrival
of Lieutenant Colonel Johnson and the
battalion at the barracks the detach
ment of the Fourth I'nlted States Cav
alry, now on temporary duty at that sta
tion, will be returned to their respective
troops at the Presidio. Lieutenant Colonel
Johnson will be the commandant of the
post at Benicia Barracks.
Major Gus G. Grant, with Companies
E and H, Is assigned station at the Pre
sidio to go into camp for instruction as
heavy artillery under the commanding
officer of harbor defenses.
Major R. K. Whitmore with Com
panies B and D has received similar
orders. These four companies will camp
at Fort Point and there learn how to
handle the big guns.
The officers of the Sixth California ap
preciate the liberality and patriotism of
Messrs. Steinhart and Lilienthal of the
Anglo-California Bank, who advanced
them one-half of their first month's pay,
amounting to $2100, without security or
interest. The request was made to them
by Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, and they
promptly responded. The money was
greatly needed, as the officers had
thrown up paying positions and had ex
pended all their ready cash.
Under the call for additional troops it
is expected that four extra companies
will be organized and assigned to Lieu
tenant Colonel Johnson's command, thus
making it a full regiment. All the other
companies will be recruited to the full
strength, 108 men and three officers. Two
recruiting details are to be sent out.
Lieutenant Walthall and Lieutenant
Mlxter. each with four men, will visit
Sacramento. Stockton, Modesto. Fresno,
Merced, Visalia and Bakersfleld.
In all tht-se places rolls have been
opened as emergency rolls, and they will
have little or no difficulty in securing the
required number of men. These details
are waiting for Instructions from Wash
ington, which are expected some time
next week.
Major Grant was yesterday presented
with a fine steed by H. O. Haas, a prom
inent business man of Stockton, who
came here on a pleasure trip with the
horse.
The Sixth Californians have not yet re
ceived their full supply of clothing, es
pecially overcoats, which are needed by
the four companies that are going to
Fort Point.
The extreme cleanliness of the camp of
the Sixth California is noted by every
one visiting the Presidio. It Is by all
odds the cleanest camp In San Francisco.
lOWANS AT OAKLAND.
Colonel Loper's Fine Command
Will Re-Enforce the Phil
ippine Forces To-Day.
Three long trains of Pullman sleepers
bearing the officers and men of the Fifty
first lowa Volunteer Infantry, together
with several freight cars containing the
baggage and horses, rolled into the depot
at Oakland pier last night. The first sec
t ion arrived at 8:20 o'clock, the others
following at intervals of half an hour.
The regiment will cross the bay at 6:30
this morning, and after breakfasting at
the Red Cross headquarters in the ferry
depot will march out to camp, there to
await orders to proceed to Manila.
The Fifty-first lowa, which has been in
camp at Dcs Moines since April 26, broke
camp last Sunday morning. It numbers
820 officers and enlisted men, including
the band and field music, but three offi
cers and twelve men were left behind to
recruit the regiment to the maximum.
The members are a fine-looking lot of
men, big strapping plainsmen for the
most part, and veritable demons In a
fight, as lowans have often demonstrated.
They are well equipped as regards uni
forms, but are short between 30u and 400
rifles, hats, leggings and overcoats. Tents
and mess furniture were Issued by the
Government while the regiment was in
camp at Dcs Moines, and as the command
brought ten days' field rations, in addition
to its regular traveling rations, the men
will not be inconvenienced by any delay
on the part of the subsistence depot here.
During the trip fully fifty men were
made ill by eating canned corned beef
furnished by the Government, and though
they soon recovered, a strict boycott has
since been maintained against that article
of diet. Six men who were taken sick
while in camp are now convalescing and
insisted on coming with the regiment.
They will be sent to the field hospital in
an ambulance as soon as they are brought
across the bay and will be able to report
for duty in a few days. The journey was
devoid of special features, more than th;it
the regiment received an ovation all along
the route. At Council Bluffs, Dcs Moln.s,
Denver and Ogden there were immense
turnouts of people to greet the -soldier;;.
At all those points the members were the
guests of the respective Red Cross socie
ties, and at Auburn and Sacramento and
other points in California yesterday the
soldk-rs were the recipients of the most
lavish attention. The fame of the San
Francisco Red Cross Society is entirely
familiar toihe lowans and they turned
in last night filled with anticipation of
the welcome awaiting them when they
cross the bay.
The field and staff and company com
manders are as follows:
Colonel, John C. Loper; lieutenant colonel
M. Miller; majors, William J. Duggan, John
T. Hume, S. P. Moore; regimental adjutant,
J. T. Davidson; battalion adjutants, George

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JTTN"E 10, 1898.
READY TO START FOR MANILA.
The Steamer Morgan City Has Been Chartered to Carry Troops
to the Philippines. A Corporal's Guard Was Put Aboard
Yesterday to Protect Uncle Sam's Interests.
"When will the troopships sail?" Is the
question everybody on the water front Is
asking just now, and it is a question that
no one seems to be able to answer. In the
early part of the week the China, Colon
and ZeaJandla were expecting to
get away to-morrow; Wednesday It was
said that they would not get away until
Monday, the 13th inst.. but that was con
sidered an unlucky day, so the sailing was
postponed until next Wednesday, and now
the general Impression is that the aug
mented fleet will not leave before Satur
day week.
The Zealandia and Colon are ready to
receive troops at any time, but the China
is still behind hand. All that the two first
named vessels require is their fresh meat
and the few extra Government stores
that have still to be put aboard. The Chi
na has still to be fumigated, and soon as
that is completed and the stores and
troops are aboard she will go into the
stream to take ammunition for the fleet.
The Morgan City is ready for stores and
men are working night and day on the
Senator to get her ready. A corporal's
guard was sent to each vessel yesterday
and a strict watch will be kept over them
until they sail for Manila.
Of the other available vessels the City
of Puebla leaves to-day for the Sound.
She is due back here on the 21st inst., and
she will then be turned over to the Gov
ernment. The Ohio is scheduled to arrive
here from Seattle to-morrow, and as soon
as she has discharged her cargo she will
be loaded for Manila. The City of Para
is discharging her Central American car
go at the Mall company's wharf, and it
will probably take a fortnight to get her
away. The Indiana is being fitted out at
Seattle and on her arrival here will be
ready to sail as soon as the soldiers and
str.rÂ» : s are put aboard.

The Fifty-first Towa was formerly the
Third Infantry. lowa National Guard
During the Civil War that State furnished
forty-eight regiments, and when the call
for volunteers came for the present con
flict the lowa regiments were numbered
where the first volunteers stopped. The
I'orty-ninth lowa Is now at Chickarr.au
ga, the Fiftieth at Mobile and the Fifty
second is still at Dcs Moines.
Colonel Loper, commanding the Fifty
first, has been connected with the lowa
National Guard for the past ten years
and is regarded as one of the best sol
diers In the volunteer service. His regi
ment Is as well drilled as any now sta
tioned at Camp Merritt.
Attached to the regiment are two news
paper correspondents. H. A. Sessions of
the Dcs Moines Register is first ser
geant of Company F, while the Dcs
Moines Leader is represented by Private
Smure of Company E.
NO HORSES FOR MANILA.
Officers May Send Them Home
or Sell Them to the Gov
ernment.
Major General Otis yesterday issued the
following general order from division
headquarters:
Iâ The commanding general having decided
that It Is impracticable to send any horses on the
troop ships, the commanding officers of the dif
ferent organizations constituting the First
Brigade will notify these headquarters Imme
diately whether officers desire to ship their
horses back to their station or to sell them to
the Government for cavalry service. This does
not apply to officers with mounted troops.
2â Every opportunity will be given by the
commanding officers of the different organi
zations constituting the First Brigade to the
soldiers of the Catholic faith to attend mans
In the tent provided on Sundays at 7:30 a. m.
and 10:30 a. m. These soldiers will also be
given opportunltes to consult the priests on
week days at such times as not to Interfere
with drill and Instruction.
3â All bands belonging to the First Brigade
will play National airs, "The Star-spangled
Banner" and "America" only In their regular
forms and not to be mingled In medleys with
other airs.
It seems to be the general impression
among the officers that the Fourth Unit
ed States Cavalry will go as infantry,
unless the Government decides to fit up
ships especially for the transportation of
the horses, which is not probable, as It
Is not thought that the animals can
stand the trip. No horses will be car
ried for the Utah Light Artillery.

With the exception of the Belgic these
are all American vessels and lfrst-class

transports be required and the Govern
ment find it necessary to charter foreign
vessels and give them an American regis
ter for the privilege, the British steamer
Victoria, now at Seattle, and the. Olympia,
due on the Sound on the 19th inst., are
available.
The Roanoke was examined while she
was here a short time ago, but the Gov

they wanted her or not that her owners
got tired of waiting and sent her to tho
Sound to go into the Klondike trade.
A telegram from Washington held her at

PAYMENT OF TROOPS
One Million Dollars to Be
Pali at Once to the
Philippine Expedi-
tionary Forces.
By command of Major General
Morritt an order was Issued yes
terday afternoon to Colonel Charles
S. McClure, chief paymaster of the
Philippine expeditionary forces, to
pay all the troops destined for Ma
nila up to July 1 as soon as prac
ticable. This wcrk will begin as
soon as all the muster rolls are
handed In, which will be not later
than to-morrow. This payment will
Include the entire Philippine force
now concentrated in San x''ranciseo.
Those troops that are to sail next
Tuesday or Wednesday will be paid
first, and the payment of the re
mainder will be made as rapidly as
possible.
Colonel McClure Is making all
necessary arrangements to proceed
with the payment without any de
lays. The sum of $125,1*0 has al
ready been paid to troops now
here, and the payment of the en
tire force up to July 1 will require
nearly $1,000,000. To be exact,
there will be disbursed, beginning
to-morrow, the sum of $940,000. A
large portion of this money will be
spent in San Francisco, and the
balance will be sent home to rela
tives by the soldiers. The circula
tion of this money will make it
rather lively for a few days In San
Francisco trade circles. The

for positions as engineers and firemen in
the navy.
Dr. B. Tomatsuri, fleet surgeon of the
Imperial Japanese navy, visited the
steamers Zealandia, China and Colon yes
terday. Dr. Lowell showed him over the
Zealandia and he was more than pleased |
with the manner in which the vessel is
fitted out. Dr. Tomatsuri has applied to
the authorities at Washlnton for permis

leave for Manila next week, but, although
it is not yet fully equipped as to clothing
it is ready to go to the front at a mo
ment's notice.
Ninety-seven recruits were secured in
Los Angeles by Lieutenant Skerritt. who
returned yesterday from a recruiting
tour.
Captain B. H. Randolph of Battery B,
Third Artillery, has received orders to
proceed to Manila. He was formerly ord
nance officer at the Presidio and is very
familiar with San Francisco's fortifica
tions. As an artillerist he has but few
equals, and he is skilled In the science of
high explosives. It was no doubt on ac
count of these rare qualifications that he
has been selected for some important
duty in the Philippines.
IDAHO TROOPS REJOICE.
Orders Are Issued to Join the
Manila Expedition Next
Wednesday.
There is rejoicing in the ranks of Idaho.
Every officer and man of the two battal
ions has a throat bursting with cheers
and a heart full of unalloyed happiness.
Colonel Jones and his command of Rocky
Mountain braves have been chosen to
complete the next expedition Manilaward
and the steamer Morgan City has been
assigned for their transportation.
Brigadier-General Otis conveyed his or
ders to this effect to Colonel Jones at
7 o'clock last evening.
For two weeks the Idaho battalions, GB4
strong, have been part and parcel of
Camp Merritt and every man jack of
them has been on the tiptoe of expect
ancy. Since the chartering of the five
vessels of the transport fleet it has been
known that there would be room for 700
or 800 men over and above the number
originally selected to sail. Rivalry has
been keen twixt the different commands
and their officers have bent their ener
gies and Influence toward the selection
of their regiments to complete the quota.
It was rumored early yesterday that the
Thirteenth Minnesota would be cut In
half and dispatched to the front on the
installment plan. This was accepted as
settled up to the time of the receipt of
General Otis' orders.
The expedition as now planned consists
of the First Colorado, Tenth Pennsyl
vania. Utah Light Battery, a battalion
from the Eighteenth and another from
the Twenty-third United States Infantry
the First Nebraska and the two bat
talions from Idaho.
There will be room for more on the
Morgan City. It will be filled by a de
tachment from the engineer corps.
Brigadier General Green will command
the expedition, and his arrangements are
being rapidly made for an early depar
ture.
Colonel Jones, commanding the Idaho
volunteers, ia a veteran of Gettysburg
and Antietam and other of. those battles
of the late difference. He is still as
anxious for trouble as when he took com
mand, and is as rejoiced as are his men
at a prospect of finding it. Saturday he
will receive from Boise City for his men
as handsome a stand of colors as will be
planted on a Spanish rampart, a favor to
be carried through battle to the honor of
the ladies of his State.
The equipment of his command, though
not complete, will be made so after em
barkation.
Another, thoughlesser, cause for re
joicing on the part of the men is the
promise of payday to-morrow.
With these two paramount events in
prospect there Is nothing to question in
the wild-eyed Joy of the Idahos.

THE "WHISPERING" BOSS.
WHILE we feel little or no concern for the wel
fare of the office-seekers in the Democratic
party of this city, we confess to a lively inter
est in the future of the large body of voters who are
every two years fooled into voting the tickets pre
pared for them by the bosses of that party. In pur
suance of a plan we have formed of promptly expos
ing all kinds of political chicanery, at this time we
deem it our duty to warn these Democrats against
one of the individuals who is attempting to subvert
their local organization for his own selfish purposes.
We refer to "Whispering" Gavin Me Nab, the rene
gade Republican, now leading Democratic boss.
Me Nab was born with an office-holding instinct,
and soon after arriving in this country from Scotland
he cast his lot with the Republican party. He began
as a pupil of the late Boss Higgins, and shortly after
being naturalized took office under Charles S. Rug
gles, a Republican Superintendent of Streets. At that
time McXab belonged to Republican clubs and every
where cheered for the old flag and an appropriation.
The general impression was that the young Scotch
man had made a happy choice in local politics and
that he was destined to hold a permanent place at
the municipal crib.
But it turned out that he had made a mistake in
selecting his party. He discovered even before the
expiration of his term in the office of Ruggles that
the Democrats carry San Francisco oftener than the
Republicans. In other words, he found that the Bay
City as a "Democratic city." He therefore lost no time
in changing his coat. He abandoned the ser
vice of Higgins and entered that of Boss Buckley.
The latter, however, did not seem to appreciate him,
and after a brief attempt to get an office under the
leadership of the Livermore sage, McNab formally
announced himself a "reformer" and look to the road.
He has now been holding up all parties in San Fran
cisco for upward of six years, anxiously waiting for
the people to call him.
It is proper that the Democrats of this city should
be made thoroughly acquainted with the three bosses
who have appointed a committee to rule them. Gould
is from Stockton and Alford from Tulare. They are
country innocents and have become in this city the
victims of "Whispering" Me Nab, the political bunko
man. If the wily Scotchman has not already sold
them gold bricks he certainly will do so before long.
If the plan which McNab has formed of capturing
the municipal Democratic party proves a success it
is safe to say that neither Gould nor Alford will get
his fair share of the resulting plunder. McNab is not
generous when it comes to distributing the offices.
Higgins and Buckley taught him that the essence of
politics is to hold on to everything with the tenacity
of death. l
Led by a renegade Republican, the Democracy of
San Francisco is not likely to succeed this year. But,
nevertheless, publication of the fact that the organiza
tion is being subverted by a Hessian should be
made and widely disseminated. Democrats cannot be
too careful of Boss McNab. He is in politics for his
own selfish purposes, and is always a dangerous
leader. A man who acts from principle may be trusted
anywhere. A man who acts for his personal interests
and who changes his political coat to get an office
can never be trusted. McNab may convert himself
Into a Republican in the midst of the fight this year
without notifying his party followers. That would
bring on terrible disaster.
It is a pleasure to note that the ex-Empress Eu
genic has joined the ranks of yellow journalism.
There is an advantage in securing the services of the
eminent, in that they are not apt to take the trouble
to denounce the palpable lie. Of course nobody of
intelligence would for an instant believe the lady to
be on the Hearstling staff, but that combination is
not catering to intelligence.
An evening paper seems to object to The Call's al
lusion to its own career as a newspaper. Naturally.
Perhaps some time the evening paper may also launch
upon such a career, but this will be after all connected
with the present management shall have gone â per
haps to heaven.
So far the war has been one-sided, and all the ex
tensive casualties have fallen to Spain. But after all
this circumstance is fortunate for Spain. She will
pay dear for any reverse which may come to any part
of the forces of the United States.
France and Russia are exchanging views as to the
disposition to be made of the Philippines. Will they
kindly extend their operations so as to include a set
tlement of the Oakland water front? That is as
clearly their business as is the Philippine matter.
Possibly the police officer who was fined for reading
while on duty had been reading an account of the
prospective exit of Chief Lees, in which case the
fine should be remitted.
JANUS fIND MAGUIRE.
JUDGE MAGUIRE in pursuit of an office offers
an interesting study and furnishes a record that
does no credit to his foresight and judgment.
In 1887 he withdrew permanently from the Demo
cratic party because it was not in favor of the single
tax and announced his intention to support Henry
George for President. Like other fad fanatics, he be
lieved that private ownership of land would
be abolished, and that the movement for its
abolition would command so large a follow
ing that it would sweep its candidates into
office. Allied to this movement in America was
the anti-landlord issue in Ireland, that had for its
motive the actual suffering of tenantry exposed to the
rapacity of non-resident landlords. In 1887, too,
there were symptoms of revoit of the Irish in
America from the church of their ancestors, and
Father McGlynn suddenly loomed in the sky as the
probable leader of an anti-Pope movement in asso
ciation with Henry George.
Judge Maguire thought that he saw a chance to
combine communism and religious bigotry and get
an office out of the shT&ffle. So he wrote his book,
"Ireland and the Pope," and it was printed for him
by his friend, the editor of the San Francisco Star,
who wanted the Pennsylvania militia killed as rattle
snakes.
In this book the method was Maguirean in the ex
treme. Where necessary he ignored historical facts/
j and where necessary he invented them; his language
' was violent, as it always is, for the Judge has su
preme confidence in the efficacy of hard words, and
thinks they fully take the place of reason and logic.
This habit is revealed in the extended title of his
book, which is: "Ireland and the Popej A Brief
History of Papal Intrigues Against Irish Liberty
i From Adrian IV to Leo XIII. --By James G. Ma-
I quire, Judge of the Superior Court of San Fran
j Cisco, California. Printed by James 11. Barry, 429
Montgomery street."
In his preface he said he would show the "treach
ery" of the Pope and "the persistent and deadly char
acter" of his interference. He said: "I conceive it
to be a most marvelous record of an alliance of cen
turies, which has been characterized by constant and
simple faith and confidence on one side (the Irish
people), and equally constant duplicity, ingratitude
and tyranny on the other (the Pope). To the Ultra
montanes who may read this book and whose stereo
typed criticism I may now fairly anticipate, I have but
to say that it is not my fault that the spiritual heads
of the Catholic church claim also to be, by divine
right, temporal rulers, theoretically, over all nations,
and in terrible reality over Ireland. It is not my
fault, but more shame to them if the publication of the
political history they have made shall disadvantage
the church. It is my purpose to assist in raising my
father's countrymen and my own kinsmen above that
groveling fear of the Pope which makes so many of
them nerveless when he strikes a blow at their coun-'
try and their race. The Pope in this respect enjoys
the unenviable, not to say infamous, distinction of
being dangerous only to those who confide in him."
With that fine preface he proceeds through 118 pages,
of epithet, in which he pays "the most cruel and bar
barous persecution of the Irish people took place
during and throughout the period of four hundred j
years before England became Protestant, and while
the Kings of England were the Pope's beloved sons
in Christ," and that Ireland "has been sadly handi
capped in her struggle by her dependence on the
broken reed of Roman honor. The whole his
tory of the Vatican shows that ever since it assumed
to be the political as well as the religious head of
the world its universal policy has been to crush the
weak, to frighten the timid and to conciliate the
strong and defiant."
That statement, it will be observed, goes outside
the Irish question and is an ascription to the Papacy
ci a universal policy of enmity and oppression to the
weak and timid.
Critics of the Papacy, who have written from the
standpoint of religious difference, have never gone
that far in ascribing a permanent and universal record
to the Pope adverse to the interests of humanity.
Describing the incidents of Daniel O'Connell's
f:ght for repeal of Catholic disabilities, the Judge
plumes his wings for a high rhetorical flight and ex
claims:
"But lo! the goddess of Irish liberty, lately so joy
ful, is weeping. She faints, she reels. Alas! the fangs
of the I'aiican urpent have been driven again to her
heart."
The special Pope described by the Judge as the
serpent of the Vatican was Gregory XVI, and his of
fense consisted in a rescript to the Irish priests to
refrain from participation in the heated political meet
ings then being held!
In America we consider it rather proper for clergy
men of all denominations to keep aloof from partisan
assemblies, and we rather fancy the Judge would
yell "murder" if a priest were to appear in a meeting
not in his interest. But for advising this wholesome
abstention in Ireland the Pope became "a serpent"
in the Maguire view.
Again, the Judge accuses the Pope of being eager
"to shelter hell hounds," and he speaks of Cardinal
McCabe as "the red-cap hunting hound of the Vat
ican."
The whole book abounds in this style of invective.
No doubt the Judge expected it to produce a pro
found impression, but it did not. His friend Barry
pocketed whatever profit came of the sale of it to
the A. P. A. lodges when they were organized, and
then it passed out of print
Now we find Judge Maguire back in the Demo
cratic party, which he permanently abandoned, and
in pursuit of office, ingratiating himself with those
whom he denounced as in "groveling fear of the
Pope," and in full cry against the A. P. A. who used
his book in their ritual.
It is a record so devious and deceitful as to astonish
one at the success which has so far attended it.
There had been a reasonable hope that the lawyers
of California would cease to make frivolous appeals
on behalf of murderers concerning whose guilt no
shadow of doubt existed, but some attorney in tire
Hoff case has overthrown this. To say that he
should be ashamed thus to trifle with the law it is his
sworn duty to uphold is expressing the truth with a
mildness scarcely warranted by the occasion. It is
strange that the Supreme Court should permit its dig
nity to be assailed in this gross and idle fashion.
While nobody wants to believe that United, States
transports are in danger of attack from Spanish war
ships, the rumor creates a feeling of uneasiness so
marked that the news of the safe landing of the
soldiers will be joyfully received.
School teachers have been generous in support of
the Red Cross, which is more to their credit since the
Board of Education has managed so the teachers
must wait months for the salaries earned.
Statements that Cervera's part in the war is ended
may be premature. It is possible that his grateful
countrymen may yet see fit to court-martial and shoot
the brave admiral
THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 10, 1898.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC TYRANNY.
THERE is no more disagreeable thing with
which to come in contact than a person of a
low order of intelligence yet by accident or the
folly of favoritism invested with a little authority,
which he does not know how to use. By some eccen
tricity of nature the smaller such a man is the bigger
he thinks he is and the more detestable he becomes
when, through any freak of fortune, this authority is
thrust upon him. He may have been only a petty
nuisance; on the instant he rises almost to the pro
portions of a calamity. He is changed to a bully, and
his inherent boorishness comes to the surface.
This line of thought leads inevitably to considera
tion of an individual who has decreed that only such
newspaper representatives as he shall elect are to be
permitted on the Pacific Mail dock, a place where his
orders are sometimes obeyed and his unwo~th always
anathematized. For while he is himself an employe,
he looks upon himself as monarch, and exacts de
feience from the unlucky employes under his thumb.
To kow-tow in his presence is a part of the duty of
each. This individual does not own the water front nor
even a portion of it. He simply occupies a position
into which he was shunted by the grace of C. P.
Kuntington, who is under the inconvenience of being
a relative by marriage and would rather have the
suffering public support *his dependent than to sup
port him himself.
Possibly Huntington did not realize what a bur
den he was unloading on the community when he
snatched this fellow from the fate of being court
martialed and gave to him the privilege of bulging
with pomp as he dictates orders to his betters. Hun
tington is the head, body and appetite of the Southern
Pacific and of the Pacific Mail. The two concerns
are so interwoven that there is no possibility of
separating them. Therefore the retention of a misfit
official at the headquarters of the Pacific Mail is as
much a railroad trick as though the official had some
other title. He is part of the long-standing imposi
tion, a noxious addition to the long list of wrongs
from which San Francisco has suffered by the acts
of the Southern Pacific. Yet this creature of the
company is as thoroughly hated by associates as by
the public. Faced by men of courage who are not
forced for a livelihood to humble themselves before
him he is a craven. Before all others he is a bluster
ing braggart, making an unpleasant spectacle and ex
cit'ng disgust of a degree of which these few remarks
art intended to be an expression.
This paper does not propose that its representa
tives shall be excluded from any place to which rep
resentatives of other papers have access, nor does it
believe that merely by swelling up after the manner
of a toad a churlish official can stand in its path with
out danger of sustaining a puncture followed by col-
U'pse. The matter will be appealed to the highest
authority. There should be no occasion for appeal
ing higher than to the Southern Pacific itself, for this
annoying trifle, practically kicked out of the navy,
is part of its paraphernalia for the subduing of happi
ness. After the first kick he alighted in an easy chair,
bnt a second kick is overdue now and should be ad
miristered without regard to where he shall alight.
Hr.ntington could win much gratitude by taking his
relative away. Here the fellow expends his energies
in insulting patrons. He is not adapted to the real
di ties of the place. He lacks the instincts of the gen
tleman and so gentlemen do not like to meet him. The
effect of his presence is to make an enemy for the
Southern Pacific at every opportunity. While not
officially engaged in doing this, he manages to make
himself so unbearable that the glare of publicity nat
urally falls on him, and by the light of it appears
clearly the brand of the ass, while the listening ear
detects the sound of a bray.
Cfl/WP MERRITT A MISTAKE.
II^JROM the first The Call objected to the removal
of troops from the Presidio to the Bay District.
* Its agitation of the matter has not been fruit
less. Soon the troops will be back where they be
long, and other soldiers arriving here will be taken
to a place beside them in the reservation.
There has never been advanced any adequate
excuse for the removal of the volunteers from
the Presidio to the Bay District. They should
have been kept at the former place, their natural
rendezvous. For such a course there were many
reasons, and for the contrary none. Nobody seems
ready to accept responsibility for the original change.
There was a suspicion that there was about it the
savor of jobber}, and this suspicion has not been
wholly allayed.
At Camp Merritt the sanitary conditions are so far
from perfect as to be an actual menace. They are
worse in every respect than at the Presidio, and have
excited much alarm. Traversed by open streets, the
camp could not be kept free from undesirable char
acters. Surrounded by a lot of abandoned houses
capable of being quickly turned to use for saloon pur
poses, it was soon hedged about by an array of
dramshops, tendimj to the promotion of disorder.
Altogether, Camp Merritt has been a mistake.
Now information comes from a reliable source that
the troops are going back to the Presidio. When the
second expedition shall have sailed the remaining
regiments are to be quartered in the Government
grounds, and regiments arriving thereafter will join
them there. This is as people interested in the welfare
jf the soldiers and of the citizens have been wishing,
and it commends itself to the wisdom of the mili-
tary authorities. There is better natural drainage
at the Presidio than on the sand flats of the Bay Dis
trict. There is more room, and there will be on the
reservation a possibility of enforcing discipline.
Such men and women as may not be considered
proper visitors can be kept away, the saloon will not
have unhindered sway, and the facilities for light and
water will be at least equal to those now available.
It is stated that the military authorities hesitated
about letting the water company invade the grounds,
fearing that it would keep forever the grip acquired
through the emergency. But the Government ought
to be bigger than a water company. The pretext is
not one appealing to the judgment, and the people
will be glad to learn that it is no longer deemed
sufficiently potent to insure the maintenance of a
camp in the midst of a thickly populated district
where it must in time have become a dangerous
nuisance.
Immediately after the announcement by the yellow
paper that only 5000 troops were to be sent to Manila
the Government renewed its efforts to get transports
enough to send at least 20,000. There is a way of
getting news out of the yellow paper, but to read all
its statements exactly backward is rather inconvenient,
and there is no other possibility of utilizing them.
The report that the rain at Manila rendered useless
the rifles of the Spanish is difficult of belief. It can
not be possible they are armed with muzzle-loaders
to which powder is fed from a cow's horn.
Correspondents ordered from Cuba were only per
mitted to depart upon promise that they would never
return. This is very like the exDericnce which awaits
the Spanish there

RALLY ROUND THE FLAG.
I ain't much hand at musicâ so I'm told by them that know;
I jest despise the catchy airs that daily come and go. '
And as f^r old â¢111 Trovytore and "Marthy," I declare
If I should hear them all my life I couldn't catch an afr.
But there's one toon I shorely like. I've heard it o'er and o'er.
And ever time it's played for me I like it more and more.
And when they Josh me 'bout my taste, whoever they may be
I say, "Old 'Rally Round the Flag' is good enough for me."
I've listened to sweet music that was touching as could be,
I've felt my heart grow tender at some soft, sweet medody.
I bear In mind how, when a child, before I learned to roam,
My mother In the gloaming used to sing- to me at home.
And I remember years ago, before I left the farm.
Before my young life ever came to any grief or harm,
1 heard my little sister singing softly 'bout the lot,
And "Rally Round the Flag" to-day just strikes the same soft spot.
Sometimes our band will play it when they've nothing else to do,
And then's when I hear mustc that is music good and true.
And when the leader jerks his stick and makes the startin' crack,
A thousand little quivers go a-skatin' up my back.
"Rally!" screams the clarinet, as high as it can git â
'X then the big base drummer gives his drum a lively hit.
"Rally!" roars the tuber in a voice that's good and strong.
And "round the flag," they all join in, and thus complete the song.
And then we lift tho happy foot and set it down with vim.
And every man is wide awake, from me to "top sarge" Jim.
And when I hear our splendid band a-makin' that good noise
I feel like yellin', "Bust yerselves! fer that's the air, my boys."
And then I look away somewhere and see Old Glory flyln'.
And it just seems to me as if I couldn't keep from cryin"!
And I think. Well, if I kain't live "neath that there striped rag.
The next best thing would be to die, a-tightin' fer our flag.
I'm not much hand at scrappin' â I will candidly avow;
I'd walk a quarter any day just to avoid a row.
And when it's necessary fer to trounce the kids a bit,
I let their mother do it â fer I jest can't tend to it.
I don't believe in bowieknlves, nor these here pocket guns,
And no one ever heard me talk of scrappin' to my sons.
It ain't my way to swagger round and bully, or to brag.
But I could fightâ and die, I guesaâ to "Rally Round the Flag."

SCHWERIN WILL
SOON BE BROKEN
He Now Imagines That the
Corporations Own the
Water Front.
Harbor Commissioners Will
Shortly Dispel the Hal
lucination.
While it may seem strange to declare
that certain <>fllcia!s of the Southern
Pacific Company of Kentucky, who are
also Identified with the mis-manage
ment of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, believe thru the entire water
front is the property of those two cor
porations instead of belonging to the
St:it._- of California, such is the fact.
These officials have been bo long used
to bullying citizens that they now be
lieve that the people have no rights
they are bound to respect. They have
taken upon themselves the power to
dictate Just who shall and who shall
nut be permitted to enjoy the small
privilege of passing through the care
fully guarded gates that lead to the
â  C Mail dock. Considering the fact
that the wharves are State property
and that the docking privileges ac
corded the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company are granted only by suffer
ance of the Board of State Harbor Com
missioners and subject to revocation at
any time, it is certainly strange that
R. P. Schwerin, who finds time to act
as manager of the purchases and sup
plies department of the Southern Pa
cific Company and also act as mis
manager of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, should stoop to mean and
petty practices that might be forgiven
if committed by a school boy. Naturally
one would suppose that an official oc
cupying the responsible position held
by Bchwerln would be above indulging
in spite work that would not be worthy
of notice by The Call were it not that
many have felt the effects of his Czar
like rule, if anything displeases him
he is ever ready to prove how vindict
ive he can be, but as a general rtile the
majority of people rather enjoy his dis
pleasing than his smiies.
The time has arrived when Schwerin
should be made to understand that the
people have some rights that are to be
respected and that the corporations he
represents do not own the entire State
of California. This lesson will be taught
him. Unless he drops the scepter of a
ruler he will be compelled to do so, for
the courts will speedily show him how
small a miu> he is in the world not
withstanding the exalted opinion he
holds of himself ana the corporations
that employ hi.n.
The Call enjoys the pleasure of hav
ing incurred the displeasure of Relent-
Persecutlng Schwerin. It came
about in the usual way. Telling the
truth was the sin committed by The
Call and for so doing the wrath of the
mighty utility man of the twin cor
porations was provoked.
A few weeks ago, when President
McKinley issued a call to arms for men
to fight for "Old Glory" and avenge the
cowardly murder of the brave men on
the; Maine, hundreds of our best citi
zens gave up their daily avocations to
shoulder the musket. The nation was
short of proper troopships and many
s were chartered by the Govern-
Among them was the City of
Peking, owned by the Pacific Mail
Steamship Coupany. Alterations were
â  Bary to afford accommodations for
. ilunteer soldiers on the steamer
and it was believed that everything
would be done to make them
on their trip to Manila
Bay, wliÂ»r>' they are to Join Dewey and
his heroes. A reporter of The Call
:red portals of the Pa
( i;"ic Mail dock one day while the alter
) c bf-ing made and wrote a
Blmple st>ry of what he saw. The City
of P'-kini; was being fitted out for the
men who were giving up their homes
and many of thr-m their lives to fight
for the old flag and Cuban liberty in
such a way that any one with feelings
of Christian sympathy would declare
that cattle rould not live between the
decks. The City of Peking was a veri
table death trap and The Call gave that
to the public. The result was
that much of the work done by the
Pacific Mail Company had to be torn
out: the bunks rearranged and better
ventilation secured for the soldiers.
That of course cost money and any
thing that looks toward an outgo in
stead of an income for the Pacific Mall
Company and the Southern Pacific
pany is frowned upon by Schwerin.
Bo it was that The Call and Its repre-
Ltives have since that time been
very distasteful to Mr. Schwerin.

â concerning the accommodations being
provided for the soldiers of the First
California Regiment of Volunteers The
Call has sinned in the eyes of Schwer
in and the corporations controlling
him.
There are other troop ships to be fit- \
! ted out and The Call will see that :
every possible accommodation will be j
made for the men.
Czar Schwerin says, however, that
i no representative of The Call will be '
! allowed on the Mail dock. He is mis- j
taken, however, for The Call will. If
I necessary, carry the matter to tha i
! highest court in the State and see that
those who leave this port to fight for
our country and flag will not pass the I
Golden Gate in deathtraps to save a
! few dollars to "Uncle" ColHs P. Hunt
ingdon and the Pacific Mail Steamshp
'. Company.
After The Call published the facts
I concerning the way in which the City
| of Peking was fitted up Schwerin gave
orders to the captain of the wharf that
no representative of The Call be per
mitted Inside the gates. Two days
| later he issued another order that the
' reporters of all the papers be kept
away from the Mail dock. There were
things going on in the fitting out of the
other troop ships chartered from the
: Pa.cific Mail Steamship Company that \
might cause criticism, and Schwerin
i took the view that it would be advls- :
i able to make a general rule, to be j
broken when he saw fit, in the interest
of other papers.
Schwerin did not have long to wait
fur an opportunity to vent his petty
spite on The Call. When the steamer
; Belgic arrived bringing news from the
Hawaiian Islands and the departed
troop ships the representatives of all
i the papers other than The Call were al
lowed to go on the wharf and meet the
; passengers. A Call representative
! passed the gate with the others and
was at once stopped and forcibly eject
ed by one of the gatekeepers, who said
that he was only "obeying orders."
It is in such small and despicable
ways that Schwerin proves his great
ness to the displeased and disgruntled
corporations.
It is probable that Schwerin has
never had time to read the law bearing
on the rights accorded the corpora
tions he represents. A few excerpts
i are here given to enlighten him and j
, show him if such a thing is possible â¢
j that the water front and its facilities
I belong to the people and that the Pa- |
cific Mail Steamship Company can,
with three days' notice from the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners, be
deprived of the many privileges it now
so shamefully abuses. Under an act
of the State Legislature the power to
â  grant leases of water front rights to
' private persons or corporations was
! rescinded, so that the Harbor Commis
sioners have only the right to assign
i or rent wharves from mo-nth to month
! for the purposes of commerce. That the
Commissioners have the authority to
take back any property rented, when,
they so desire, is found in chapter
I CLXXI, section 6, page 194, of the
: Statutes and Amendments to the Codes
of California:
"The said Commissioners shall have
the possession, jurisdiction and control
over the blocks and parts of
blocks formed by the change of
the water front and the extensions
of the streets to the thoroughfare
aforesaid and remove any obstructions
placed thereon in- the same manner as
provided for the removal of obstruc
tions from the piers, wharves and thor
oughfares. The Commissioners are au
; thorlzed to keep and maintain said
blocks and parts of blocks as open
spaces for the use of the public, or they
I may, in their discretion, inclose them.
! The Commissioners are also authorized
I to assign the use of such portion there
! of as they deem expedient for such
purposes solely as will be most advan
tageous to the commerce of the port,
! and upon such terms and conditions
jas they may determine. All such as
'â  signments shall terminate at the pleas
! ure of the Commissioners."
It will be readily seen rrom the law
I quoted above that the people, in the
: name of the Harbor Commissioners,
still hold the water front as State
property. This may be news and un
pleasant news to Schwerin and the Pa-
I ciflc Mail Steamship Company. If they
i have in the past been misled The Call
cheerfully calls their attention to the
mistake.
Another section, and it is not quoted
for the reason that it is included in the
agreement signed between the State
! through the Harbor commissioners and
â  by the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany through Its officers, provides that
| the privileges now enjoyed by the cor
poration can be taken away upon three
days" notice. The steamship company
now holds the property at a monthly
rental of $1800 and is only guaranteed
possession from one month to another.
It is explicitly set forth in the section
above quoted that the assignment of
water front rights shall be made "upon
such terms and conditions as they (the
Commissioners) may determine."
It is confidently expected that before
the month expires the Commission-
kwill by resolution add "terms and
litions" that will prove to the Pa-
Mail Steamship Company beyond
shadow of a doubt that they only
and do not own the valuable prop
erty now occupied by them. The terms
and conditions will be that every one,
Sliding the forbidden representatives
The Call, shall be entitled to free
?ss to the Mail dpck. The Harbor
imissloners fully appreciate the
ridiculous and untenable stand taken
by the self-important Schwerin and
will let him and the corporations he
represents know Just where they stand
on the water front management of af
fairs.
If Schwerin and his superiors had
ever given attention to the decision
rendered by Judge Hebbard in Novem
ber, 1895, in the suit of Morton Brothers
against the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company they would not, unless they
believe themselves above the law, at
tempt to deprive any one of the right of
entering the Mail dock. In the Morton
case the steamship company sought to
give a monopoly of the transfer busi
ness to the Pacific Transfer Company
to the exclusion of all others. The
representatives of the Morton Company
were denied the right of entering upon
THE SAX FBAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JTJJS T E 10, 1898.
the wharf rented by the . Pacific Coast
Steamship Company. The case .was
stubbornly fought and after all the law
obtainable bearing upon the case had
been quoted Judge Hebbard decided
that the steamship company was "un
fairly discriminating against the plain
tiffs in granting exclusive privileges to
the Pacific â  Transfer Company upon
State property, which tends to create a
monopoly and is a usurpation of au
thority not given to it by either, the
constitution, the acts of the Legislature
or the resolutions of the Board of Har
bor Commissioners."
Uncle Huntington has been guilty of
a few praiseworthy deeds. It was kind
of him to save his nephew from being
court-martialed in the navy a few years
ago. Every one appreciated that kindly
act on his pait, but. no - one will be
found who is willing to say that it is
kindly on his part to inflict the people
of the State with the presence of the
autocratic Schwerin. ,- " '-'.'^
The friends of Schwerin say that he
is hardly to be blamed or held respon
sible for the idiotic orders he at times
issues. His sleep, they say, is nightly
broken by visions: and dreams of the
poor unfortunates who went down with
the steamer Colima . that was over
loaded "under his supervision.

PROTESTS FROM
HOT DEMOCRATS
NORTH BEACH VOTERS STATE
THEIR GRIEVANCES.
Denounce the Central Committee's
Action and Demand Fair
Representation.
If the Democratic State Central Com
mittee had been present at Washington
Square Hall last evening they would
have heard some statements of facts
that would have caused them some un
easiness. There was no band to play "A
Hot Time," etc., but there was a goodly
crowd of earnest Democrats representing
the North Beach district, who were in
a decidedly hot frame of mind, and they
took occasion to express their feelings
emphatically.
The meeting was held for the purpose
of protesting against the action of the
Democratic State Central Committee in
arbitrarily appointing a managerial
Committee of One Hundred to control
the affairs of the party in this city, â with
out giving the northern section. 01 ban
Francisco fair representation.
Walter Pilkington called the meeting
to order, stating its object, and J. A.
Spinetti offered resolutions in accordance
therewith, as follows:
Whereas The State Central Committee of
the Democratic party of this State has seen
fit to make an attempt to take from the on Il
legal ami recognized General Committee of the
Democratic party of the city and county of
San Francisco, of -which committee Major Har
ney is chairman, the power which is vested in
it, viz., to manage the local affairs of the
Democratic party and to provide the manner
and mode of electing delegates to the State,
muniripal and legislative conventions. There
fore be it
Kesolved, That we. the bona-flde Democrats
reyl.iing at North Beach, here assembled at
W.-ishington-pquare Hall, corner of Union and
?t'-" .-kton streets, most earnestly protest and
object to any and all arbitrary action on the
pan of the State Committee of the Democratic:
party in making any attempt to deprive the
voters of the city and county of San Francisco
of their rights to participate in the primary
affairs of the party. Be it further
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions
be forthwith forwarded to, the State Central
Committee, with a request that we be heard
In the premises and given a voice in this mat
ter of vital importance. And said State Cen
tral Committee Is hereby most respectfully re
quested not to carry Into execution a plan
which will prevent every bona-flde and honest
Democrat from participating in the selection
of members to represent thorn in a general
county committee or to suy nominating con
vention, be It State, municipal or legislative.
Mr. Spinetti. in presenting the resolu
tions, said that as a Democrat born on
North Beach he protested against anj
power depriving him of his constitutiona
rights to take part in the selection o
men to represent him. He declared th
action of the State Central Committe
to be un-Democratic and un-American
The most cosmopolitan district in th
city, the Forty-fourth, in a committee o
100 was given but one represt-ntativL
while in strong Republican district
there were as many as nineteen on th
committ<-t>. "We have the right," sale
he, "to say who shall represent us, no
only in conventions, but in office, am
these resolutions cover our grievance."
The resolutions were adopted unani
mously.
Charles Reynolds, in the course of hi
remarks, said that under the new re
gime it made no difference what dis
trict a Democrat lived in, he had no rep
resentative except the "high joint" Com
mittee of One Hundred, who were electe
for life with power to appoint thoir sue
cesnors. Thnse men, Me Nab, Alford am
Gould, "from the cow counties" had com
to the city and robbed honest Democrat
of their birthright. "I think." said he
"the Democrats of this part of the cit
will say to Mayor Phelan and his fellows
'You can put these men before us, bu
you can't make us vote for them.' Th
right to participate In the affairs of th
party was all that was asked for. ]
the action of the State Central Commit
tee was proper and in the interests of the
party, then the committee could as well
go to Stockton, Sacramento or San Jose
and take the same action to force their
candidates on the party.
"This is despotism," said Mr. Reynolds.
"Let us quit or stand together and defeat
them at the polls if they will not be
just." This sentiment was greeted with
enthusiastic cheering.
E. J. Hill, speaking to the resolutions,
said the battle for the right of repre
sentation began with the Boston tea
party, and that that theory had been the
cardinal principle of the Democratic
party to this day. "It is our privilege as
American citizens to say who shall gov
ern us," said the speaker, "and we can
not permit anybody to deprive us of it, p
not even Governor Budd, Mayor Phelan
or any one else in the party. If they have
come to the point where they cannot
trust the men who have horny hands,
then we must say to them 'We cannot
trust our destiny as Democrats in the
hands of a kid-glove gentry.' "
The meeting adjourned with cheers for
the sentiments expressed.
WANTED IN BAKERSFIELD.
Frank Brown, a Colored Man, Ar
rested in Oakland.
Frank Brown, a colored man, was ar
rested in Oakland yesterday by Deputy
Constable Bert M. Tibbet of Bakersfield
and brought over to the City Prison,
where he was booked en route.
Tibbet says that Brown was employed
by Mrs. Davis, who has a barber shop in
Bakerafield, and about three weeks ago
he skipped, taking with him a quantity
of jewelry and the receipts for the pre
vious two weeks.
According to Tibbet a charge of murder
! may be entered aganist Brown. M^3. Da
vis' husband was murdered about a year
ago and suspicion fell upon Brown, but
sufficient evidence has not yet been ob
tained to fix the guilt upon him.

PECULIAR
DEAL IN
LUMBER
Combination of Some
Big Local Firms.
WILL FIGHT WOOD & CO.
STRUGGLE FOR THE TRADE OF
THE HARBOR COMMISSION.
An Attempt to Torce a Firm to
Give Up a Big Contract
Taken on a Low
Rate.
There is another disturbance in lumber
circles which threatens to lead to some
sensational developments.
For some time past there has been a
mutual understanding between both
wholesale and retail dealers not to sell
lumber to the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners for less than $14 per 1000 feet. In
order to be In line with the policy of
those doing business with the board it has
been tho rule to charge the board more
than any one el*e for materials.
During the past month there had been
an unusual tightness in the market, and
every effort has been made by firms to
dispose of material on hand. The E. K.
Wood Lumber Company, although a
party to the agreement that has in the
past been carried out to the letter, cre
ated a tremendous row by jumping over
tho traces and putting in a bid some days
ago to furnish lumber to the Commission
ers during the next six months for $11 50
per 1000 feet, thus breaking the compact
and causing the companies in the deal to,
metaphorically speaking, foam at the
The contract has not as yet been let out
by the Harbor Commissioners, but the
disgruntled dealers, knowing that the E.
X Wood Lumber Company will accept
the contract as it can make a snug profit
by the venture, have set about to punish
it for its rashness. â¢
With this end in view they have planned
a scheme by which the deserting com
pany will suffer two-fold. At a meeting
which was held the following day a new
agreement was signed by the "combine
to this effect: "Not to sell to the success
ful bidder." This was done in anticipating
the Wood Lumber Company's success
knowing that although the successful
bidder has a large supply of lumber on
hand, it is not enough to supply the Har
bor Commission continually during such
a long period.
The State law demands first-class lum
ber but it is a well-known fact that when
first-class lumber Is in demand in outside
circles all the Harbor Commissioners get
is second-clHss material. It is presumed
that the Wood Lumber Company cannot
keep up its contract under such a state
of things, and the "combine" figures that
it will force th# Wood Company to throw
up its contract or come into the combina
tion under the old programme. But, if it
dare go ahead under the bid of $11 50, it
will be simply impossible to buy lumber
at less than $14 per thousand feet, which
would mean a grave loss.
The fight is now on, and those familiar
with the situation are on the gui vive a3
to its outcome. Those of a sporting turn
< f mind are wagering that the company
will abdicate, while others who are ac
quainted with the firm are willing- to bet
that it will fight to the bitter end.
THE CASE IS NOW
UNDER ADVISEMENT
SUIT ON AUGUST WIDBER'S
BONDS SUBMITTED.
A Decision Is Expected in a Week
or Ten Days â No Appeal Will
Be Taken.
Whether or not the city and county of
San Francisco or the Fidelity and De
| posit Company of Maryland will be out
j the amount of money embezzled by cx
i Treasurer August Widber now rests with
j Judge Belcher. The suit of The People
to recover $100,000, the amount of the re
sponsibility of the surety company, was
\ submitted yesterday after argument had
j been concluded, and a decision is expect
!ed in about a week or ten days. The Fl
! dellty and Deposit Company has stated
i that it will nbkle by the decision of tho
j court now having the case under consid-
I oration, and this being the fact. Judge
j Belcher will take all the time necessary
to study the authorities and precedents
cited by counsel before filing a decision.
Judge Cope argued the case on behalf
I of the Fidelity and Deposit Company,
and Garret McEnerney argued in the in
terest of the city and county. Many ques
tions of law of a purely technical nature
made up the arguments of the lawyers
and at the conclusion the case was sub
j mitted. Judge Belcher announced when
! he took the case under advisement that
j he would notify the attorneys to be pres
! ent previous to rendering his decision.

Prophets Are Betting on
Gilt Edges.
TEAMS MUST WAKE UP.
THE NECESSITY OF PRACTICE IS
URGED.
Here Is a Chance for the Managers
of the League to Prove . That
in Truth They Are
Magnates.
BY JOE CORBETT.
The Gilt Edges, from all accounts, will
simply walk away with the pennant. At
any rate, such is the opinion entertained
by the "fans" in Sacramento. From the
game these boys have been putting up
ever since the consolidation the claim
made by their supporters is by no means
groundless. Out of all the games played
they have met with but one setback, and
that at the hands of a team which, since
leaving Fresno, has been tearing down
the toboggan at a terrific gait. In eleven
games they have made but twenty-one
errors, an average of a little less than
two a game. This record, while not phe
nomenal, is nevertheless great work and
a billion per cent higher than any team
that I have seen play at Recreation Park.
There is no getting away from the fact
that if the rest of the clubs do not wake
up and play ball in a very few weeks the
Gilt Edges will be beyond recall. Such is
the state of affairs at the present mo
ment, and when one is capable of realiz
ing what an important factor daily prac
tice cuts in a league race it ts easily un
derstood why this team will clear out
everything before it. "Practice makes
perfect." No collection of players, be
they "stars" or not, can expect to play
the great national game unless they re
sort to unremitting practice. Just imag
ine a team supposed to be of the best
making from four to nine errors every
game they play. This has been a very
common occurrence at Recreation Park,
and it is gradually becoming tiresome.
Last Sunday the San Franciscos defeated
the Fresnos. It was a good game, vet
each side made four errors. The fact that
they did hot make ten each was such a
surprise to those present that many" Im
mediately advanced the opinion that in
the next game the error column would
be full to overflowing.
It is very evident that the patrons of
the game have been educated to expect
this sort of thing, and it is really sur
prising. Errors, of course, belong to
baseball. Without them the game would
be robbed of a great slice of its glorious
uncertainty, and we all know it is this
uncertainty which makes it so popular.
It does not, however, necessarily follow
that from four to ten errors should be
a part of every game of ball. This style
of play does not glisten with uncertainty,
Decause it happens in all games, save,

He has now ia his charjje one of the largest stationary engines in the manufacturing
district of Kensington, and for more than fifteen years .was one of the most trusted
engineers in the employ of the Reading â  Railroad \ Company. Speaking of RI PANS

gineers, like all other human beings; are subject to ills and more than once RIPANS :

relieve me thoroughly and quickly was a RIPANS TABULE ! and ]l ; still take one

take their place."

possibly, In one or two instances, such as
that of last Sunday, and a number of
such mistakes in a single game of ball Is
outrageous. The fault is very evidentâ
iack of practice." How can these teams
expect to play ball if they do not devote
some of their leisure moments to prac
ticing? The players cannot be blamed
for yellow playing. Why should they
practice and wo Vie overtime when the
money comes without wasting this en
ergy? It is the duty of a manager to see
that they do practice. He should make
them get out every day and set the ex
ample by appearing at the grounds him
self. If it be impossible to do this he
should resign in favor of some one who
will look out for the welfare of the club.
Why do the Gilt Edpes play such steady
ball? Because they practice, not before
a game, but every day. When they ap
pear on a diamond and compete for su
premacy it is not a case of chance with
thorn. They do not go after a ball with
the fear of missing it, which comes only
from lack of practice. They play with a
dash that is beautiful to gaze upon, for
it is real baseballâ National League base
ball in a good many respects. They bunt,
and do so properly.
In a game last week five safe bunts
were made in succession. Such playing
at the bat will win nine times out of ten.
It is the only way to play. How is it that
they accomplished such a difficult feat as
making five safe bunts in succession?
The same old story â practice, practice,
practice. They do not waste their time
making fancy one-handed stops and
catches, like a good many players I have
seen. It is team work with them. What
we want to see at Recreation Park for a
change is a game of ball, played by teams
which are not completely demoralized
through lack of "appetite" for practice.
This can only be had by the managers in
sisting on their players practicing every
day, and by appearing on the scene to see
that their orders are strictly obeyed. In
this manner, and no other, can League
games be productive of good baseball, the
kind that is expected. Let these other
teams follow in the wake of that great
Gilt Edge aggregation.
Individually, I cannot say that they are
the best batch of players on the coast,
but as a team they certainly are In a class
by themselves. I have seen them play
but three times (rather brief acquaint
ance), yet in those games I have wit
nessed more real base ball than all of the
other games combined. It was only re- I
cently that I learned this team practiced
every day and consequently it does not |
take long to figure out the secret of their
success. They are at the top of the lad
der, and will remain there so long as they
continue to adhere, to the methods now
employed. I can see no possible way of
their being headed in the championship
race, unless the other teams practice
daily. In this way, and no other, can the
race be made interesting. For the benefit
of the game, and those interested in see
ing it again placed upon a solid footing, it
would be well for the managers to "get
in the game" and demonstrate their right
to be termed magnates. The success of
the game rests in their hands. They can
easily make both ends meet by giving the
"fans" good baseball, and the quicker
they realize the importance of daily prac
tice the better for all concerned. The
Baltimores practice for two hours every
morning whether they have a game in the
afternoon or not. They won the cham-
Fiionship for three consecutive years by
ollowing out these three most important
rules: Practice; Practice; Practice.
Failure to Provide.
The case of Percy L. Smith, carpetclean
er, charged with failure to provide, was
dismissed by Judge Low yesterday.
Smith showed within the past fourteen
months he had contributed $336 toward
the support of his family, notwithstand
ing' the fact that he had been for some
time out of work. He denied that he had
expended any money belonging to his
wife, as stated by her friends.

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal

temperature. The word "high" means high ;
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied j
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres- !
pure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows", usually '
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high In the interior and low I
along the coast, and the isobars extend north j
and south along the coast, ruin is probable;
but when the "low" la inclosed with Isobars of I
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is im- |
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of :
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali- ;
fornia coast, wanner weather mey be expected
in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
MEW YORK. June To-day's stock market
was almost a repetition of yesterday' . ex
cept that the marked weakness of Sugar had
rather less effect on the general market than
â¢was the case yesterday. This stock began to
drop from the opening and fell away by spurts
until ,the recovery In the final hour. Appa
rently some support wan forthcoming at each
successive point downward, or the Bellini? pres
sure was temporarily relaxed. These occasional
rallies were not of large proportions, and the
stock succumbed readily to renewed raids upon
it. The extreme decline was over, four points.
Brooklyn Transit was the most conspicuous
stock for strength. A very large and urgent
demand developed for It In the latter part. of
the day, blocks of 1000 shares lifting the price
one-quarter of a pnlnt t>* a time to a little
6ver 3 points above that of last night. To
bacco was a medium between strength and
weakness. It was weak at one time, during
the morning, but was very conspicuous In the
afternoon rally, rising strongly over four
points. This< rise and the rally In Sugar came
after the news from Washington of the action
of the donffrees on the revenue hill.
The railroad list w.'is comparatively neglected,
the market being distinctly one of specialties.
There was a drive agalnct thf Grangers in the
late dealings, which carried Burlington down
nearly a point litM'.w last night's level, but a
full recovery was effected before the close.
Borne of the railroads failed to respond, and
the market shows some net losses For the
most part there was a disposition to let the
railroail lift alone on account of the unset
tling Influences of the w^akn'-ss In Sugar. The
strength in Brooklyn Transit was duf- to the
large increase in earnings shown with the ad
vent <if pleasant wt-ather. The local gas se
curities were all ctron" both on th<- exchange
and In the outside market, on renewed talk of
consolidation of all existing companies. But
the strength was not fully maintained. The
closing was active and strong at full recov
erien in some cases.
Railroad bonds wore active, and the dealings
were well distributed. Prices were better held
than stocks, though there was a yielding In
the early afternoon on realizing in the specu
lative lines, with a subsequent rally. Total
sales, $3,fi25,000.
United States new fours coupon declined %.
and the old fours registered advanced % In the
bid price.

Bank of England for Japan.
Spanish 4s were flat, t
Americans were lifeless. The length of the
forthcoming account Is again an active specula
tion. There are difficulties In the corn trade,
owing to the fall In prices. One Important firm

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 9.â The chief factors In
Wheat at the start was the upward movement
In Liverpool and the continued rains in this
country. Some of the early cables from Liver
pool quoted July nearly 4c per bushel higher,
with September also stronger. This gave the
bulls here considerable encouragement and at
the same time caused shorts some alarm. The
rains in the winter Wheat belt continue, and
as the havest is near at hand traders begin
to fear a wet harvest, so that shorts were in
clined to cover, and there was also some dis
position to take the long side for a turn. On
the other side of the account were the follow-
ing fresh pieces of Information: The Kentucky
State crop reports gave the condition of Wheat
at 104. which wns said to be the highest ever
recorded In Kentucky. Thoman's June crop
report pave conditions Indicating a total crop
ot winter and spring Wheat of unprecedented
magnitude, 775,009,000 bushels being the estl
m.-.te from the present outlook. The market be
came gradually heavy as the session pro
gressed, the bearish reeling being encouraged
by the prospective harvesting of an Immense
crop, and the early advance was lost. Leiter
brokers were heavy sellers of September at
the decline. At the present rate of shipment
the contract grade in store will soon be less
than 500, "00 bushels. This Imparted a good deal
of strength to July. At the close July waa %c
lower and September l%<g/H4c lower.
The excessive rains In the Corn belt caused
prices to. rule strong In spite of the heaviness
In Wheat. July cloned V4c higher.
Sympathy wlt?J Corn and unfavorable crop
reports caused a strong market in Oats. July
closed %i5 >T /fcc higher.
The selling pressure In Provlslona was ap
parently relieved and there was buying by
packers who have been sellers heretofore this
month. The close showed advances all around,
25c in pork and 17VÂ£c each in lard and ribs.

AS HIS WIFE
Ernest Jones' Influence
Held Till Death/
STORY TOLD IN A SUIT
ANNA JOHNSON FIGURES IN A
DIVORCE CASE.
Mrs. Gertrude Jones Will Soon Be
Given a Decree, but There
Will Not Be a
Trial.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, June 9.
Ernest N. Jones is hardly likely to
come back to Oakland to clear up many
of the mysteries surrounding his life
during the past four years. Although
the answer to the complaint of Attorney
Francour was withdrawn yesterday, It
has not assisted in any way to prevent
the facts of this romantic tragedy from
being made public. On March 23 last Mrs.
Gertrude Jones filed her complaint for
divorce and the chief allegation consisted
of the fact that her husband had been
keeping a separate establishment in San
Francisco and other places and passing
off the girl Anna Johnson, since mur
dered, as hie wife.
Much surprise was shown during the
trial of the case that Hulda Johnson, the
sister of the murdered girl, Bhould show
bo much affection for Jack Howard, who
was on trial for being concerned in
Anna's death. Still more surprise was
shown when Hulda and Howard were
married, and it is still more surprising
that they kept their secret of the real
Identity of the girl's betrayer for a whole
year.
Investigations made into the career of
Ernest Jones show that at various times
and In various places he and the young
girl now dead figured as husband and
wife, or as relatives. He was frequently
asked how he dare run the risk of call-
Ing Anna Johnson his wife when she was
in appearance a mere school girl, about
15 years of age. Yet under different
names they have registered at the Grand
Hotel in San Francisco and at the Vic
toria in Oakland as man and wife.
Nor was Anna Johnson the only girl
with whom Jones was friendly while try
ing to persuade his wife that he was still
faithful to her. He corresponded with
marriage bureaus, and reports show that
after Anna's death he had an acquaint
ance with a young lady from Southern
California, who answered one of his let-
ters.
About a year ago a young lady who
was the bosom friend of the Johnson
girls told to The Call the story of Anna's
secret and as much of it as could be sub
stantiated was published at that time,
but it was reserved for Jones' wife to
completely reveal in her complaint for
divorce and in her answer to Francour'a
complaint the dual nature of her hus
band.
When the story was published Jones
was so overcome with fear that the "Er
nest" of the dying girl would be revealed
that he called a consultation of his at
torneys and said he was willing to pay
a good price to secure the silence a>i the
newspapers. He was advised that it
â¢would be better to try no such thing, as
such an offer on their part would un
doubtedly lead to an exposure of every
thing that he wished to keep secret. Yet
Mrs. Jones declares in her statement filed
and withdrawn yesterday that her hus
band told her he needed her money to
suppress blackmailers and purchase si
lence. On this showing Mrs. Jones ob
tained some money from her wealthy
relatives in San Francisco, which Jones
used to suppress facts in the possession
of the Johnson family and a girl named
Nerny. Miss Nerny would have been one
of the leading witnesses for the prosecu
tion had her story been told, but Jones
â¢ ucceeded in Inducing her to leave Oak
land until the trial was over.
It is now stated that Jones exercised a
etrong influence over the young girl with
whom he consorted. Before she was taken
to the house where the operation was
performed which resulted in her death,
Jones exacted from her a solemn promise
that she would never mention his name.
Even on her death bed she would never
repeat more than the word Ernest, and so
loyal was she to Jones that she made a
dying statement charging Jack Howard
and Dr. Sharp with being responsible for
her death. Hulda Johnson, now Mrs.
Howard, said yesterday that she knew at
the time of her sisters death who was
responsible for it. At that time Howard
had lost his position because of the scan
dal, and he and nis wife were induced
for a money consideration not to make
public the facts.
Not long after the trial Hulda John-
Bon went to Stockton and was there mar
ried to Jack Howard. Some months later
they came to Oakland to reside, and Hul
da professed to be converted at a reli
gious meeting and gave her auditors to
understand that there was a heavy secret
on her mind. She has not revealed what
It was until now. She and her husband
have been living a very quiet life in this
city, but Howard, although a hard
working, respectable man, has been un
able to procure much work, and this is
advanced as the excuse for taking money
for continued silence.
About two months ago Jonea left his
haunts around the bay and has not been
seen since. The records show that his
wife's divorce suit went by default, but
was later reopened by stipulation and
submitted on depositions. No decree has
yet been granted.
major Mclaughlin arrives.
Two Months in Washington and the
Business He Transacted.
Major Frank McLaughlln arrived last
night from Washington, where he has
been for the last two months. The major
says that he has worked incessantly
while in the East and has accomplished
eeveral very important matters. On his
arrival 4fi Washington he found the au
thorities averse to even thinking of al
lowing the San Franr.'sco Postoffice to
be built of marble. "Granite" was their
cry afid nothing else. But before leav
ing for this city he was assured that a
call for alternative bids, either of marble
or granite, would be allowed by the Gov
ernment.
The major also says that there is a
strong national sentiment throughout the
East in favor of holding the Philippines.
There is hardly a person in Washington,
political or otherwise, who Is not desirous
of forming a provincial government out
of the Philippines under the flag of the
United States. The feeling of the people
in support of "the Presiuent, he says, is
growing day by day.
The Soldier Novelist Here.
Brigadier General Charles King, soldier
and novelist, arrived last night from Mil
waukee, after a very fatiguing Journey of
four days. General King received his ap
pointment for the volunteer service from
President McKlnley and is assigned to
duty under Major General Merritt. He
graduated from West Point in 1866 and
has been in the regular army from that
time until his late appointment. In all
General King has written thirty novels,
some of the most famous of which are
"Between the Lines," "The General's
Double," which was written last Novem
ber, and the "Colonel's Daughter," which
is, perhaps, the most popular of all his
stories.
Lutherans Successfully Entertain.
The entertainment given under the aus
pice* of the members of the St. Mathieu
Lutheran Church last Wednesday even-
Ing at Foresters' Hall was both enjoy
able and successful. Many good num
bers appeared on the programme and
were greeted with general enthusiasm by
a large and appreciative audience. The
feature of the entire entertainment, how
ever, was the patriotic songs rendered
by the Golden Gate quartet, the members
of which are all well-recognixed singers
of ability.
PREVENTING
ANNEXATION
Reed Has Allies in His
Campaign.
ALL DEMOCRATS COOPERATt
DELAY IS THE GAME SO Â±AR
SUCCESSFULLY PLAYED.
Some Senators Strongly Urge the
President to Sent a Message
Asking the Adoption of the
Hawaiian Resolution.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 9.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Speaker Heed has some valuable al
lies in his campaign to defeat the Ha
waiian annexation resolution by delay.
Representative Bailey and almost the
entire Democratic membership of the
House are co-operating with the Re
publican Speaker.
The principle on which the Demo
crats are working is that every day
that consideration can be delayed in
the House makes it probable that Con
gress will adjourn before the Senate
takes final action.
The more earnest advocates of action
in the House were anxious to obtain
action to-day that would result in the
Hawaiian resolution being made the
unfinished business and thus get the
right of way.
The bill to enable soldiers to vote for
representatives in Congress was pend
ing before the House and Bailey em
barked on a filibuster which he kept up
until 5 o'clock, when Dingley brought
forward the conference report on the
war revenue bill. He was thus able to
prevent anything being done for Ha
waii to-day.
President McKinley has not yet defin
itely determined to send a special mes
sage to Congress urging the adoption
of the annexation resolution. Whether
he will do so or not will depend on the
course of events in Congress the next
few days. He has the matter under
consideration, and some Senators who
have talked with him have strongly
urged him to send in a message. They
feÂ«l confident that if he will take this
action the passage of the resolution
will be greatly expedited.
STRAIGHT-OUT
POPULIST TALK
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOB ANGELES, June 9.â W. C. Bow
man, one of the foremost Populists in
the State and in 1894 a candidate for
Congress, has created a sensation by
taking a pronounced stand against fu
sion. Until to-day he has strongly ad
vocated It, but to-night he made the
following declaration over his own sig
nature:
"If this fusion scheme Is at the bot
tom of a device for the distribution of
patronage and division of spoils, no
honest Populist can touch it. If our
country is to be rescued from the po
litical corruption and spoliation it has
wrought, it must be done by patriots,
not by political jobbers and place
hunters, even though they may call
themselves Populists.
"In short, after surveying the whole
ground, my voice is for fusion on one
condition onlyâ fusing parties as a unit
on an Identical platform and under one
name. In my opinion fusion on any
other plan is di3honest and unclean.
Fusion on conflicting platforms is dirt.
Fusion on a Bingle platform with a plu
rality of parties is absurd. All true
Populists, in the very nature of the
case, will favor this plan of fusion.
"Silver Republicans have already fur
nished sufficient evidence of their will
ingness to do whatever is generous and
reasonable. If the Democrats object,
it will be for one of two reasonsâpos
sibly both. Either their conversion to
reform is a sham, or else they will
place pride and prejudice of party name
and prestige above the great principles
Involved. Their own course must de
termine this whole question."
In other words,Â« Bowman opposes fu
sion unless the Democratic party gives
up its name and entirely loses its iden
tity.
JAPAN AND
THE TEA TAX
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs HouÃe,
Washington, June 9.
W. D. Stevens, counsel for the Japan
ese legation In Washington, said to
The Call correspondent to-night:
"Japan has not filed a 'protest'
against the war tax on tea. We prefer
to call It a 'memorandum.' In addition
to the statement which we filed with
the conference committee yesterday the
Minister thlÃ morning filed with the
Secretary of State a similar memoran
dum showing that the tax of 10 per
cent will fall most heavily upon Japan,
while it will not swell the revenues of
the United States to any considerable
extent for the reason that a email
quantity of tea will be imported. There
is a very considerable quantity on hand
in this country now, especially in Chi
cago and Philadelphia. It Is asserted
by the Japanese Minister that the pro
posed tax will work a hardship on the
poorer classes, as the bulk of the Japan
tea trade applies to the cheaper grades.
"In view of these facts the question
naturally arises: Is it Judicious to en
danger by legislation, which Is even
colorably hostile, this growing com
merce in a quarter of the world where
so much Is hoped for American,com
merce? Can the United States gain
anything by alienating a country which
is rapidly becoming one of her best
customers, for the sake of. a compara
tively Insignificant increase in her pub
lic revenues? The proposed duty may
not be aimed at Japanese commerce,
but the effect will be the same as if it
had been. Commerce does not travel
upon sentimental lines, but if Japan Is
deprived of a market for her teas in the
United States she must look elsewhere,
and it must follow that her imports
from the United States will decrease."

MENLO PARK, June 9.â For many
weeks society circles of this place have j
been all agog over the nuptials of Miss
Emilie Doyle and Francis Pope, which
were solemnized here in the Catholic
church this morning. The little church
was transformed into a veritable con
servatory of foliage and Dloom, and
truly might it be said that never was
love accorded a more royal welcome
than on this occasion. The altar was
decorated with choice flowers of a yel
low and white color, while inside the
chancel rail were rare potted plants,
palms and dainty ferns. A nuptial
mass was celebrated by Archbishop
Riordan, assisted by Fathers O'Riordan
and Wakeham.
At the conclusion of the mass Miss
Hilda Andenson played a wedding
march and the bride and groom ap
peared at the altar and were made hus
band and wife, Archbishop Riordan
performing the ceremony.
The bride was attended by her sister,
Miss Marie Doyle. Barthley Oliver was
best man. The bride was exquisitely
robed in a neat-fitting dress of white
silk, with white chiffon trimming. A
bunch of natural orange blossoms was
worn. The bridesmaid's dress was of
blue silk, with bouffant pink satin
sleeves.
Friends and relatives representing
the elite of Menlo Park attended the
ceremony. The bride is the youngest
daughter of John T. Doyle, the well
known capitalist and lawyer. Mr. Pope'
is a rising young lawyer of San Fran
cisco and one of the attorneys for the
Hibernia Bank.
After the wedding an elegant break
fast was served.
TRIUMPH OF
JOURNALISM
(special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 9.â The Herald's
"Washington correspondent says: Ad
miral Cervera's cablegram to the Her
ald, printed yesterday, saying that
Naval Constructor Hobson and the
men who were taken prisoners with
him had been turned over to Lieuten
ant General Linares, were being treat
ed as Spanish officers of same rank and
were well, was read with much inter
est by officials of the navy and
all friends of Constructor Hobson and
his brave men. The Herald was much
commended for its enterprise in get
ting this dispatch, in the face of all the
difficulties in the way of communicat
ing with the Spanish Admiral at this
time, and Admiral Cervera was praised
for his courtesy in allowing friends of
the prisoners to know that they were
being well cared for and were all well.
Acting Secretary Allen highly praised
the Herald and expressed great satis
faction at having such trustworthy
news from Constructor Hobson and his
men. He said he could but wonderhow
the Herald had been able to get into
communication with the Spanish Ad
miral and obtain a cablegram from
him.
Among the members of both houses
of Congress the Herald dispatch was
read with interest. Representative
Pearson of North Carolina, who Is an
uncle of Naval Constructor Hobson,
was particularly delighted to learn
that his nephew and the latter's men
were well. He said he had feared they
might be in danger of illness as a re
sult of their imprisonment.

A NEW QUALIFICATION.
A Question Asked by Hugh Craig
of Congressman S. G. Hilborn.
, The . matter of Hawaiian annexation
seems to cut a considerable figure with
certain members of the business â  com-
munity in the line of indorsing or reject-
ing candidates who aspire for Congres-
sional honors. S. G. Hilborn has served
as a member of Congress from the dip- .
trict across the bay for several terms
and no reproach has ' been cast upon hi 3
official conduct. A number of his friends
have expressed the desire to .see â  him
again fill the position he now holds, and
they are making a canvass of the com-
munity to see how the land lies. In.
one direction, the Chamber of Com-
merce, approval seems to be based â  upon
one point, how Mr. Hilborn stands on
Hawaiian annexation as indicated by
the following telegram which was sent
to the Representatives at Washington,
yesterday:
SAN FRANCISCO. June 8, 1898.
Hon. S. G. 1 Hilborn, Member of Congress,
Washington, D. C : I have been asked to sup-
port your renominaticn for Congress. Before
committing myself I desire Information as to
how you stand, on annexation of Hawaii. We
desire an immediate vote favoring annexation.

FIGURES BY THE MILLION
COST OF PRODUCING LEWES AND
ALL EQUIPMENT.
The Southern Pacific Company Fight
ing Hard to Prevent a Reduc
tion of Its Fares by the
Railroad Commission.
The taking of evidence in the suit
of the Southern Pacific Company
against the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners to restrain them from reducing
fares on th<- plaintiff's lines, proceeded
for some time yesterday afternoon before
United States Court Commissioner Hea
cock. Commissioners La Hue and Hln
ton were present, but took no active part
In the case. The railroad was represent
ed by Attorneys Herrln and Garber, and
Attorney General Fitzgerald appeared
for the State. â¢
The only -witness called during 1 the
hearing was AY. G. Curtis, head of the
department of maintenance, of way and
construction of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. The proceedings were not produc
tive of much matter of interest, being
confined almost entirely to the reading of
tabulated statements containing a mass
of figures intended to give the court in
foriiiU'.io;) as to tne mileage cost of the
plaintiff's roads, real estate, equipment,
rolling stock, buildings aiiu vessels, cal
culated to show that the proposition of
the defendants to arbitrarily reduce the
tariff charged by the company on its
roads in this Stare was a dire hardship
and would be disastrous if carried out.
A peculiar feature of the evidence was
that the liguivs were nearly all based on
the "cost per mil^e," including steam
boats and other quoer things In that con
n. One of the Items which caused
some amusement was the bunching of
"legal" with "gen*-ral" expenses and
basing it on the mutage proposition. It
Bhowed that the cost was $306 71 per mile
per year, or over a million and a quarter
dollars each twelvemonth.
The hearing opened with presentation
of a certified copy of articles of incorpor
ation and amalgamation of the Southern
Paciiic and its feeders in California. At
torney General Fitzgerald would not
agree* to the admission of this document
until it vras shown that the incorporation
took place after the pending suit was in
stituted, namely, April 13. 1898. Upon YV.
O. Curtis taking the stand Mr. Fitzger
ald entered a statutory objection to his
testimony as to facts concerning the
business and property of the plaintiff ex
cept as an expert, if he was testifying
as an expert it was satisfactory, but If
otherwise the books of the company
must be produced. Mr. Curtis proceeded
in the capacity of expert and toiled
through the columns of ligures, dilating
upon their meaning as suggested by Mr.
Ilerrin, He related his experience as a
railroad man, during which he had been
connected with the Central and Southern
i'a. \:\r companies since 1565. As Mr.
Curtis gave his age as 49 years, it was
shown that he began his career at a very
early age. His testimony was for the
purpose of showing what it would coot
at the present time to reproduce the
property, this being taken as its actual
present value, aside from good will and
franchises. The mileage was given as 3998
miles, the cost per mile of which to-day
would be $42,025 03, including all lines
owned or leased in California, making a
total cost of $132,294,109. These figures do
not include the cost or value of street
franchises. Station grounds are listed at
$1090 44 "per mile," giving real estate a
credit of $3170 13 per mile. For each mile
of track there are 17 6-10 lineal feet of
tunnels, estimated to cost $1353 41 per
foot; "rip-rapping," etc.. $559 32; ties,
timber and bulkheads. $582 per foot, giv
ing a total with other minor sums of
$7788 75.
It seems that bridging where trusses are
used cost $112ti SO per lineal foot, trestles
average $533 51 to tne mile, making a total
in this branch of $25.M 90 to each mile.
Suowsheds average 53.7 lineal feet to the
mile, costing $403 20. The main tracks, re
quire )-.5.0l long tons of Iron to the mile,
costing (3222 58, and side tracks 21.51 short
tons, 5771 18. Other items elaborated by
Mr. Curtis, such as ballasting, turntables,
shops, machines, tools, supplies, fire pro
tection, telegraph lines helped to make
up the total, while the mileage on equip
ment was given as $4461 U; buildings,
$1157 So; engineering, etc., $3200 85; general
and legal expenses, $306 71; interest and
commission, $3347 4S; Southrn Paciiic Com
Â§any, material and supplies, $336 55;
outnern Pacific property, $755 50; docks,
wharves. Moating equipment, etc., $785 CB.
Referring to the cost of securing water
for the operation of locomotives Mr. Cur
tis said tne engines must be supplied ev
ery twenty or thirty miles and that in the
desert sections the cost "if securing non
mineral waters which would not destroy
the bailers was very great. In the Colo
rado Desert wells had been sunk 2400 feet
at a cost of over $60<X) and no water se
cured, and In consequence there were
places where water had to be hauled In
water cars.
Coming to the San Francisco. Sacra
mento and Los Angeles terminals, Mr.
Curtis stated that their "per mile" cost,
including side tracks, shops, wharves,
slips, etc., was $3257 55. This gave a grand
total for the 2595.69 miles of road in the
State of $42,025 02.
Attorney General Fitzgerald evidently
got weary of minor details, such as wash
outs and repairs to culverts and suggest
ed that the company might a? well In
clude lightning- and earthquakes as prob
able causes ol toss, at ah cv which Mr.
Curtis sweetly smiled and retaliated by
calling attention to the losses caused by
damage to persons and property in the
course of buiici. :ir and repairing roads.
Mr. Herrin then took another course
and offered a list of items of cost of the
entire Pacific Coast system, not including
Oregon lines, or the Mojavp branch for
merly belonging to the company. Mr
Curtis began giving his figures, stating
that the total mileage was 4313.12 on main
line, costing an average of $37,777 7U per
mile, and making a total of $102.9^0 SÂ°'<;
Among the various properties proing' "to
make up this enormous sum were named
the steamer Solano. at Port Costa, the
ferry and river Steamers, dredging ma
chines and tups, valued at $2,474,431; of lo
comotives. 4fi7. value of $4. 435 550 ' eight
dining cars. $120,000; 67 Pullman sleepers
three-fourths value, 1854 250; 2< tourist
pleopers. threo-fourths value. $M SSO- 341
first class day cars. $1,611,550; ':'< second
class passenger cars. $121, iK); 85 combi
nation passenger and ha?" â <re cars, $140.
000. and 105 mail and express cars, 1372.850
At this point Mr. Fitzgerald Interposed
an objection and declared that as Mr
Curtis was " testifying to alleged facts
they must naturally come from the books
of the company, and this being the case
he insisted that the bonks were the best
evidence and must be forthcoming
After consulting Mr. Curtis Attorney
Tlerrln announced that the desired rec
ords would be produced, and the hearing
went over till to-day at 2 p. m.

STOLE A TANDEM BICYCLE.
Warrant Out for the Arrest of Ralph
Sinclair for Grand Larceny.
H. C. I?pst. bicycle den lor. 309 Uroderlek
ftreet, swore to a complaint in. Tutipe Pon
iards court yesterday charging Ralph Sin
clair, his clerk, with grand larceny.
Sinclair has been in Best's employment
for the past three months. Wednesday
he stole $4 from the till and rode away
on a tandem bicycle belonging to W. E.
Goodrun, superintendent of the Spreckels
Sugar Refinery. He has not been seen
since.
The young man has been a source of
troubla to his mother, who lives on Page
and Broderick streets, for some years. He
was in the habit of stealing articles of
Jewelry from the house and pawning
them, and within the past three months
it has cost his mother over $150 to redeem
them. A few months ago he was shipped
to the Sandwich Islands, in the hope that
a change would do him good, but he re
turned as soon as he could. It was his
mother's intention to send him away
again.
FOR A PRESIDIO CAMP.
Efforts to Move the Soldiers From
Private Grounds.
Some time ago the Chamber of Com
merce called the attention of the War
Department at Washington, through the
Pacific Coast representatives, to the fact
that the sewerage conditions and water
supply at the Presidio were such as to
make it necessary for the troops now
quartered in this city to be moved upon
private grounds. Also that the private
grounds are so located that street car
lines that are out for all the traffic will
bear are reaping the benefit of the
change, whereas if the Presidio was put
in proper condition the soldiers could ride
from camp to town without cost. The re
quest was made In several dispatches that
the matter be looked into and the evils
corrected, especially as a number of
towns arounci the bay are bidding to get
the troops away from San Francisco in
order to get the benefit of their patron
age. The matter has received attention
;i.t Washington as shown by the following
letter:
WASHINGTON. June 3. 1898.
H-jph Cm!?. President of Chamber of Com
merce. San Franciscoâ My Dear Sir: I am in
receipt of your telegram of June 2. relative to
the Presidio reservation and it* Inadequacy as
a camp for troops with your suggestion that
a water supply nnd sewerage he at once sup
plied. I havp placed a copy of your telejp-am
before each member of the delegation, and the
matter will be thoroughly Investigated, and
will also present it to the Secretary of War.
Yours very truly. (iEO. i. PERKINS.
COL' ECTED POLL TAX
FROM HIS WORKMEN
SERIOUS CHARGE AGAINST CON-
TSACTOK BUCKMAN.
The Matter Is Now Being Investi
gated by the Grand Jury and
Labor Commissioner.
A matter of no small Importance Is be
ing considered by the Grand Jury. It Is
a charge that the Buckman Contracting
Company has been collecting poll tax
from its workmen without authority of
law or the sanction of the Assessor.
The case was called to the attention of
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald by two
of the employes of the company named.
Both men have sworn to affidavits set
ting forth these facts. Harry Biggs
states that he was a teamster In the
service of the Buckman Contracting
Company and resided at Buckman's
camp at 14 Guerrero street. He has
worked for these people since last No
vember, quitting on June 1. In settling
with his employers he was given time
checks for $18 09, which was $2 less than
was due him, after deducting board,
lodging and other incidental expenses.
He demanded the $2, and was told by
Rodgers, the bookkeeper, that the mon
ey had been withheld to cover his poll
tax for the city and county of San
Francisco. Biggs demanded the formal
receipt, such as is always given by the
Assessor, but was told that there were
no receipts.
Biggs was not satisfied, so he went to
the main office at 302 Montgomery
street and again asked for the receipt
for the poll tax that had been withheld
from his pay. After some talk, in
which the head bookkeeper stated that
he had none of the regular receipts,
Biggs was given a receipt which read:
"San Francisco, June 6, IS9S. Received
from Harry Biggs two dollars. Account
poll tax deducted. Buckman Contract
ing Company." Biggs took the case to
the Commissioner, and In making his
statement said: "I know of my person
al knowledge that all of the men work-
Ing for the Buckman Contracting Com
pany on the first day of March, and
who were paid subsequently, had this
same amount deducted from their
wages and wore not given the official re
ceipts for the same. In many Instances
this amount of two dollars was ail or
nearly all that the laborers had due
them at the time of payment."
Deputy Green at once called upon the
Tax Collector and was told that no
authority had been given to Buckman
or any of the company to collect poll
tax nor had any receipts been given to
them. He asserted that the office had
trouble with these same people last
year for the same offense. Mr. Green
says that to-day he will make an inves
tigation of the Buckman camp and ex
amine the books of the concern. He
has learned that there are about 110
men working in this camp and that
Buckman has collected poll tax from
all of the men. He also made collec
tions at the camp In Marln county,
where about 100 men are working. Dep
uty C. L. Dam has laid the matter be
fore the Grand Jury.
WIRES ARE EXTENDED
TO THE NORTH
WESTEBN UNION COMPANY IN
CONTBOL OF VICTORIA.
A Final Test of the New System Suc
cessfully Made â It Is Now in
Operation.
The new northern extension of the
Western Union telegraphic system from
Seattle to Victoria has been completed.
The final test of the wires and cables
has been made and everything Is In readi
ness for immediate operation.
The completion of this northern line
means better facilities, as the circuit
means the death to a long practiced mo
nopoly by the Canadian Company and tne
speedy reduction of the exorbitant tariff
of transmission which has been dictated
and enforced by the company since its
Institution. Although the Western Union
line has only been In operation since the
commencement of the present week the
standard price of telegraphic communica
tion from this city to all the points tra
versed by the new lines has been reduced
from 75 cents to 60 cents, with a promise
of further reduction in the near future.
In addition to this decrease of public tax
for the use of the new lines the facilities
for transmission afforded by means of a
perfect system of copper wires and Im
proved cables will be greatly Increased
anu will prove Invaluable to patrons of
the city and the State generally.
The new line extends from Seattle to
Victoria, including in its circuit Port
Ulakely, Port Gamble, Port Townsend
and Port Angeles. The lines are now be
ing further extended, and when completed
will include Vancouver, B. C, via Blame,
New Whatcom and New Westminster.
To accommodate the demands on the
new system offices will be established at
all the above mentioned points, thus com
pletely controlling the entire sections tra
versed.
The extension of this northern line re
quired the construction of eight separato
cables, the longest being eight miles, and
the erection of 125 miles ,of land lines of
copper wire. The total cost of tho entire
circuit has been estimated at $100,000.
The Grand Jury.
The Grand Jury met yesterday and
considered the building of the Hall of
Justice. They had the members of the
Buildinps Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors up as witnesses, and also Frank
Shea, the architect. Mr. Britt of the
committee was examined, and he told all
he knew about the delay. Mr. Rivers
and Mr. Sheehan. the other members of
the committee, were not called, as the
investigation was not concluded. The
superintendent of the work was also
called, and the contractors were on hand,
but the jury did not get very far Into
the case, so most of the witnesses will
have to call aK^in. The excuse offered
was that the firm of contractors has
sunk a lot of money In a terra cotta plant
to supply that part of the material, and
that they want to get the plant well
started before they proceed.
General Miles, commander-in-chief
of the United States army, explains
the lessons of the present war in next
Sunday's Call.

HIS CINCH
WAS NOT
IMMORTAL
Lees Rebels Against
the Truth.
HE IS ANXIOUS TO HOLD ON
AND HE INTENDS TO HOLD ON
GRIMLY.
The Head of the Police Department
Denies That He Is to Bo
Forcibly Retiredâ But
He Is.
Information that the head of Chief
of Police Lees was to fall on July 5 was
not received by that gentleman with
evidences of joy.
In fact, he denied that the basket had
been prepared for the receipt of his dis
tinguished dome of thought. He seemed
to have an idea that the cinch he had
on the place was Immortal.
Nevertheless, the information given
yesterday is true. Lees has been slat
ed to go, and Dr. Keeney has been
slated to take the place thus made the
oretically vacant. Chief Lees denies
the authenticity of the report. Dr.
Keeney smiles and expresses surprise
and a doubt as to whether he will ac
cept; Chief Lees tears his slivered
locks and makes remarks of warmth,
but of no particular value. Even Com
missioners Alvord and Tobln refuse to
admit that their plans have been laid
bare. It is true that the Commission
ers were not ready to have the pro
gramme declared. It is also true that
The Call took the liberty of laying it
bare.
For a long time there has been so
strong a feeling that Lees has outlived
his usefulness, that the commission
could not well ignore it. It was the
general opinion that a younger man
should have the place, a man of more
recent vintage, and free from any
barnacle growth. Therefore the in
timation that Keeney was in training
for the position did not come as a Bur
prise. He is familiar with police work,
holds the rank of sergeant, has recent
ly been studying modern methods as
in vogue in Eastern cities, and is withal
a popular and respected citizen. So
it will soon be "Chief Keeney." All
the denials which have been made had
been anticipated. There are plenty of
reasons why the commission should not
wish its plans known, though none why
they should not be known.
Chief Lees says the report is due to
personal spite and that there is noth
ing: In it, excepting this. Herein he
errs. There is no spite against the
Chief, but that the police force should
be under control of a competent ex
ecutive is evident. It has not accom
plished much of late. Thugs and
thieves seem to be getting along tol
erably well. The police are doing noth
ing so far as appears. They occasion
ally figure in a procession, and all ad
mit willingly, look well there. At the
head rides the Chief, brilliant with gold
braid. But the best work of a model
Chief of Police is not done while he be
strides a prancing steed. The needs
of San Francisco demand a man who
does not live in a procession nor in the
past. The Chief of Police cannot be
considered as an individual. He may
be a good fellow, without the ability to
catch anybody, who is very decidedly
the contrary. He may have a record
for bravery and astuteness, but be no
longer capable of living up to it. He
may have acquired a great fortune on
his modest salary, and, nevertheless, be
Incompetent to direct men, to inspire
them with confidence.
Several newspaper men yesterday
sought the Chief. They wanted an ex
pression of his views, and they wanted
consolation for the misfortune of hav
ing overlooked the most important lo
cal news. They got these in abund
ance. The Chief assured them that the
etatements were unfounded, and they
were glad to believe him. They found
In his denial a vindication and a com
fort. He seemed to find the same
things himself, and repeated the de
nial at every opportunity. Neither did
Dr. Keeney Indorse the story. To do
bo would not have been in the best of
taste. But he did not appear to be ut
terly flabbergasted as the Chief had
been. He said the proposed action of
the Commissioners was a great sur
prise to him. He did not know that he
would be willing to give up his prac
tice and accept a situation Involving
â¢o much care. The doctor admitted
that he had known about some contem
plated change In the department. He
thought there was room for many Im
provements and that a younger man
was needed for the position held by
Lees.
Dr. Keeney was busy accepting con
gratulations from hundreds of friends.
"I was never spoken to by any of the
Commissioners on the subject," he
eald, "and while I had an Inkling that
they proposed making a change never
for a moment thought I would be theif
choice. I do not think I would accept
the honor, not at any rate until I had
given the matter grave consideration.
"There are a great many reforma
needed In the department, but I do not
know whether I shall be the one to
make them. I am afraid the cares of
office would be great. I am physician
to the department now and have been
for four years, holding at present the
rank of sergeant."
But the Chief himself was more defi
nite. He spat and sputtered as is his
wont, vowing the while that the whole
Btory was a lie with a capital L and an
exclamation point. He went so far as
to laugh at It, but the laugh did not
resemble a burst of gladness.
Everywhere the subject was spoken
of the resolution of the commission to
retire Chief Lees was commended. The
fact was recalled that by years and
term of service he is entitled to rest
and a pension and upon the date men
tioned will go on the roll for the largest
pension paid in the department. There
fore those who had toward him the
kindliest feeling were not prepared to
say that justice would not be done by
placing him among the "has beens,"
where by virtue of his recent record he
belongs.
As to denials of the Integrity of the
revelation made yesterday they cut no
figure. There had been no expectation
that a scheme not as yet openly dis
cussed would be acknowledged by the
people intimately concerned. Lees
would not acknowledge it; because of
a desire to resign and avoid the em
barrassment of being kicked out to live

by Local Players.
WAS A ONE SIDED GAME
SMALL CBOWD SEE THE VISI
TORS MEET DEFEAT.
Comrades Cheer Loud and Long, but
With Little Useâ Frisco
Played Great
Ball.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Recreation Park was the scene of a
rather unique game of baseball yester
day, In which a picked nine representing
Sun Francisco met and defeated a club
composed of the Minnesota Volunteers.
It Is not often that lovers of our national
game are given an opportunity to see
real live soldiers play It, and those who
failed to put In an appearance yesterday
most assuredly missed a great treat. The
crowd was hardly as large as it might
have been, and this scarcity of "fans"
was undoubtedly caused by the very
threatening weather. The "boys in blue,"
however, turned out In great numbers,
bringing with them the Thirteenth Min
nesota Regimental band, and swelled up
the small attendance caused by our pe
culiar climate. The stands were liter
ally covered with them, and how they
did "whoop her up" when their repre
sentative ball tossers made any kind of
an old play. The game opened up In
true military style, and really had the
appearance of the opening of a new
league. The Minnesota band, gayly be
docked in their regimental uniforms,
formed a line and began a procession,
followed by the officials of the league
and the two contesting teams. On com
, ing to a halt in deep center field they
circled around the tall flag-pole, and
I while the band piayed in loud and beau
i ttful strains the "Star-spangled Banner"
' an immense copy of the stars and stripes
; was unfurled amid a tremendous out-
I burst of enthusiasm among the specta
! tors. After this most patriotic in
cident Umpire Creamerâ who very kindly
! volunteered his services â yelled "play
j ball," and in a very fpw moments all
; was over with our gallant poldter boys
j save the shouting, as tho San Franclscos
Immediately piled up eight runs. After
thin brief bombardment the game was
stripped of its attractiveness so far as a
j chance for the Minnesota team to win
! was concerned, as it was quite evident
j that they were outclassed. However, the
| game proceeded, each Inning lessening
the chances of our Eastern friends, until
after two hours of good and poor play
ing the San Franciscos came out victori
ous by a score of 2G to 5. This big score,
! however, does not signify that the game
i was devoid of brilliant plays and other
j interesting features. The simple fact of
i the soldiers having a day's recreation
! was enough to gladden the hearts of all
j those present, and the gallant manner in
! which they cheered and rooted for their
colleagues, even when defeat was star
ing them in the face, added additional
glory to the occasion. Then the band
rendered some very charming and stir
ring music. It even went so far as the
"midway" in its selections, accompany
ing Mr. Tucker in his rendition of "She
! never saw the streets of Cairo."
This very amusing incident occurred
when Tucker succeeded Scallon in the
box. His walk appealed to the band, who
had been inhaling the fumes of cigarettes,
having a decided "Turkish odor, as be
ing characteristic of the "poor little
country maid," and so they opened up
with the "muscle dance" music, which, I
must confess, was not entirely out of
place, for If ever a fellow had that "sus
picious muscular movement" in his work
it was Mr. Tucker. Tins gentleman gave
a very good account of himself, however,
and if his walk was slightly "Midway"
his curves were not. Scaring the honors
with Mr. Tucker were Hosier. Ritchie
and Shepparrl. Each of these gentlemen
made brilliant Individual plays, Mosier,
however, outshining the others, his
catch being the more difficult. It was a
running one-handed catch of a long drive
to the left field ffnoe, and was about the
best seen at Recreation Park this season.
Mr. Mosier should foel very proud of his
work. The Minnesota team, although
badly defeated, should not feel discour
aged. To be sure they did not play the
best kind of a game, yet their work was
excellent, when one considers that their
facilities for practice are lacking in a
good many respects. Then, again, their
team was composed for the occasion
without an opportunity to practice team
work, and this certainly did handicap i
them. There are some very promising *
players outside of those who were con- i
spicuous in yesterday's game, and with I
a little more team work, intermingled !
with practice, they undoubtedly would
give some of our city teams a hard
brush. Something in the nelghbprhood
of $250 will be turned over to the society
of the Red Cross.
The score is as follows:

ROBBERS
ATTACK AN
OLD WOMAN
Mrs. Bonnet, aged 78,
Brutally Beaten.
ASSAULTED IN HER HOME.
OFFICES PESHON MADE A
MISTAKE.
He Arrests Her Elderly Husband on
Suspicion of Having Com
mitted the Dastardly
Crime.
Josephine Bonnet, aged 78 years, living
at 10 Stark street, off Stockton, between
Pacific and Broadway, was the victim of
two brutal robbers last night. The un
fortunate woman was sitting In the
kitchen of her home when her assailants
crawled through an open window and de
manded to know where she kept her
money. When she refused to tell them
one of the men struck her in the face
with his clenched flst, knocking her to
the ground. He then jumped on her and
threatened to kill her if she did not re
veal the hiding place of her money. Fear-
Ing that they would kill her their aged
victim pointed to a bed In the adjoining
room as If to indicate that her money
was hidden there.
While one of the brutal robbers stood
over her to prevent ncr from making an
outcry his accomplice searched the bed.
securing $47, which was hidden under the
pillow. They then left tne house, after
threatening to return and kill her if she
notified the police.
The pitiful screams of the Injured
woman attracted the attention of several
neighbors, and they went to her assist
ance. While they were endeavoring to
force an entrance to the house the aged
husband of the unfortunate woman ap
peared. A police officer named Peshon,
evidently anxious to . swe.. his record,
promptly placed him under arrest. He
was taken to the City Prison and his
name entered on the small book. Mrs.
Bonnet, covered with blood, was subse
quently taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where it was found that "she hau re
ceived a lacerated wound of the forehead,
a contusion of the face and also wounds
of the nose and cheek.
For some reason tho police did all in
their power to suppress the facts of the
brutal assault. A patrolman named
Knight, who, through his Influence with
Chief Lees has been assigned toautyin the
City Prison on account of the absence of
Desk Sergeant Bidwill, even went so far
as to prevent the reporters from obtain
ing Bonnet's statement. He declared that
he was running the prison and would do
as he pleased. Captain of Detectives
Bohen, on hearing of his Czar-like meth
ods, promptly sent Detective Dillon to
call him down.
To Detective Dillon the aged prisoner
said that the first he knew that his wife
had been assaulted and robbed was when
be walked along Stark street on his way
home. He saw a crowd standing in front
of his house, and, fearing that something
had happenod, he became excited and
started to elbow his way through the
throng. Just as he had reached the steps
leading to his house he was seized by an
officious policeman, who placed him under
arrest for assaulting his wife.
Bonnet, who is 87 years of age, was very
wrathy when he was locked up and
threatened to Institute proceedings
against the city for false imprisonment
immediately upon his release from cus
tody.
Through an Interpreter Mrs. Bonnet
Bald that she was mending an old dress
when she heard a knock at the door. She
paid no attention to it and resumed her
work, when suddenly she heard the win
dow being opened. The next instant she
was attacked by two evil-looking men,
one of whom struck her In the face, fell
ing her to the floor.
The unfortunate describes one of the
robbers as being about 30 years of age
and rather tall. The other was of me
dium height and had a dark mustache.
She says that they both wore slouch
hats, which were pulled down over their
eyes as if to conceal theic features.
The doctors at the hospital regard Mrs.
Bonnet's condition as being very serious,
principally on account of her old age*
In the Divorce Courts.
Decrees of divorce were granted the
following mismated couples yesterday.
Charles P. Holt from Ann Maria Holt on
the ground of willful desertion; Augusta
Gunther from Carl Gunther on the
grounds of willful neglect and desertion;
Addle Pettijohn from Jonathan Pettfjohn
on the ground of desertion; Ida M. Can
ning from M. X Canning: on the ground

THEY HELD
A SECRET
CAUCUS
Budd, Buckley and
Phelan Form a
Combination.
ARE MAKING UP THE SLATE
THE CITY AND COUNTY COMMIT-
TEE IS THEIRS.
Plans Intended for the Defeat of
Maguire and the Promotion of
the Mayor's Political
Ambitions.
The men who are to rule the destinies of
the new Democratic City and County Com
mittee met in secret caucus yesterday and
began the making up of the slate that in
due time will be handed out to the public
as the true expression of the will of the
local Democracy.
Other things than the preparation of a
slate were developed at the back-door
meeting. There no longer remains a doubt
that the Democratic party, through the
new governing body brought Into exist
ence by McNab, Gould and Alford. has
fallen into the hands of a combination
composed of Governor Budd, Mayor Phe
lan and Boss Buckley.
The fact that such a combination was
formed was suspected by shrewd poli
ticians when Buckley Joined with Phelan
to secure the adoption of the new char
ter, and Budd, as a member of the com
mittee having In charge the pacification of
the local Democracy, went back on the
Rainey-Uarney faction and pooled Issues
with the powers that brought the pres
ent City and County Committee into exist
ence. This suspicion became a certainty
yesterday when the controlling spirits in
the new committee met secretly to perfect
a plan of campaign.
The first business to be determined was
the permanent organization of the City
and County Committee. This was speedily
disposed of. It being decided that at the
meeting to be held this evening John P.
Dunn shall be elected chairman. Since
Dunn graduated from the sand lots un
der the tutelage of Denis Kearney he
has been a persistent office-seeker and has
established for himself a reputation that
commends him to such politicians as now
have control of the governing body of the
local Democracy.
The secretary of the committee is to be
Thomas Walsh, a member of the Iroquois
Club and one of Phelan's most ardent
supporters. An attempt was made to in- I
duce Harry Kelly to become a
for the position, but he was apprised of
the fact that his candidacy wa.s desired
for no other purpose than to give to the
proceedlngo the semblance of a contest,
so he gracefully declined the honor.
Some progress was made in the prepa
ration of a local slate, but for obvious
reasons the work of the caucus in this
direction was limlu-d. The nomination of
Harry Creswell for the office which he
now holds was decided upon. Ex-Senator
Pinder is to get the nomination for Coun
ty Recorder and Tax Collector Bloch is
to be given an opportunity to be re-elect
ed to the office which he now holds.
There was a difference of opinion as to
who should be given the nomination for
Public Administrator, and for the pres
ent the place is still open. It was agreed,
however, that no matter who the nominee
may be M. C. Hassett is to secure the ap
pointment as attorney for the official ,
when he shall be nominated and elected, j
Superior Judges Wallace and Seawell, >
whose terms expire with the present year,
are to be tendered a renomination.
So far as the office of Auditor is con
cerned Phelan is firm in his determina
tion that Broderick shall be left off the
list of eliglbles. Who the lucky man is to
be has not yet been agreed upon, but it
will not be Broderick.
This is as far as the new Democratic !
dictators have gone with the local slate.
As to what part the new powers are to
take in State politics there seems to he
an entire unanimity. The chiefest con
sideration, and one upon which all are I
agreed, Is the defeat of Maguire. Not j
only are the Congressman's late guber
natorial aspirations to be nipped in the
bud, but the powers have decreed that he
shall even be defeated for the Congres
sional nomination. To attain the first
named object Phelan is to be put for
ward as the Democratic candidate for
the place at the head of the ticket and
every effort will be made to secure for
him the nomination. To prevent Maguire
from securing the Congressional nomina
tion another plan has been agreed upon.
This Is to hold the Congressional conven
tion before the State convention, con
trary to the ordinary custom, anil to give !
the nomination to another man, possibly ]
Joseph Kelly. The success of this scheme
depends upon }ts secrecy, the motive of

the plan being to keep Maguire In Ignor
ance of what is intended and secure in
the belief that If he fails to stampede the
convention in his behalf for Governor he
can then fall back on the Congressional
convention. By holding the Congressional
convention first the statesman will be
taken by surprise and he will not be left
a leg to stand on.
James H. Barry is to have the Con
gressional nomination in the Fifth Dis
trict. Hinton will be nominated for Rail
road Commissioner, and John H. Grady
will be put up as a candidate for a place
on the Board of Equalization.
Budd, Phelan and Buckley believe that
they are in a position to dictate their own
terms to the party, and there is little
doubt their ability to do so if they can
retain their hold on the new City and
County Committee. In this they have
the assistance of such able lieutenants as
McNab and Gould of this city. Fitzgerald
of Oakland and Corporal Braunhart. Al
ford will probably retire to the wilds of
Tulare County when he finds that he has
been made a catspaw of to haul the
chestnuts of more astute politicians out
of the fire. The report of the coming in
terview between Alford and his friend
Maguire would no doubt be Interesting
reading.
The McKinley Club.
A large and enthusiastic meeting of the Mc-
Kinley Republican Club was held last night.
Addresses were made by E. J. Jackson A. L.
Pemus. J. T. Hawkins of Pasadena, William
Sampson of Los Angeles and several other
speakers. Hon. George Pardee was elected to
honorary membership. Quite a number signed
the roll.
The Olympia Club.
The Olympla Republican Club was perma
nently organized last Tuesday night at Cali
fornia Hall, 620 Hush street. Every seat in the
hall was occupied, and from the interest taken
by those present and the number of signers to
tlie roll, the assurance is that the club will be
one of Hie largest and best organized in the
city. The club effected temporary organiza
tion at the same hall on Tuesday evening, Mr.
31. Judge Severance delivered an able a.ldress
and was followed by John D. Kersey, A. P.
Wagner, I>avid Cam. George W. Adams and
others. The following are the officers elected:

HEARTY CO-OPERATION.
Chamber of Commerce Wants Sailing
Ships Inspected.
That the idea of having sailing vessels
properly inspected before they are al
lowed to carry passengers has taken the
fanoy of the Chamber of Commerce is
shown by the following communication
1 sent to the Board of Supervisors in an
swer to one informing the Chamber of
the appointment of a committee to pro
cure such legislation.
| John A. Russell Esq., Clerk of the Board of
Supervisors. San Francisco â Dear Sir: It Is
with rr.uch pleasure I acknowledge receipt of
your favor of the 7th lnst., In regard to taking
some action to restrict the practice of sending
out unsÂ»aworthy vessels from this port.
I am directed by our president, Mr. Hugh
I Craig, to say that we are in hea/ty occerd
| With the movement for the furtherance if
which ycu have appointed a commute-; con
sisting of Messrs. Clinton, Morton and Lack
niann.
It !b only necessary to walk along the water
front south of Market street and see the class
of vessels advertised to sail for Alaskan points,
to have It impressed even upon the non-nauti
cal observer that many of them are unfit for
the trip, and should the vessels be seaworthy
In themselves, the manner In which cargo Is
placed on them renders them exceedingly dan
gerous. This Is not confined to new vessels,
but many of the new ones are so built and so
laden as to be entirely unfit for an ocean voy-
age.
We will be most pleased to co-operate with
your committee and the Collector of the Port
in endeavoring to stop this dangerous practice.
The next meeting of our Board of Trustees
will be held Tuesday, June 14, at 2 p. m.
Yours very truly, E. SCOTT,
Acting Secretary.
