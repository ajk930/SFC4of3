CLIMAX OF THE
UNLUCKY CAREER
OF THE NEW YORK
Driven by a Gale Upon the Halfmoon
Bay Beach the Old Ship Oakes Is
Wreckedâ Narrow Escape of
a Second Vessel.
HALFMOON BAY, March 14.
âThe three-masted ship New
York, fifty-eight days from
Hongkong, went ashore here last
night about 7:30 o'clock and will
probably prove a total loss. The
New Yurk had a valuable cargo,
principally of silks and tea, all
of which will be lost. The vessel
is lying deeply imbedded in the
sand, about 200 yards from the
cliff, with the waves dashing
over her. There is but little hope
of being able to save her. There
was ten feet of water in her hold
at noon to-day, and It is expect
ed that at any minute she may
turn over. The cargo is valued
at about $600,000.
There were twenty-one people aboard
the New York when she drifted in on
the beach last night. The -crew con
sisted of Captain Thomas Peabody.
First Mate W. C. Callip, Second Mate
W. Wilson, Steward Johnson and four
Japanese sailors. The names of ' the
other seamen are Murphy, White,
Burke, Paulli, Perkins. Sweeney,
V Brock, Gleason, Wilson. Johnson, Don
ovan, Disavers and Giles. Captain
Peabody's wife and his seyen-year-old
daughter, Claire, wei^ also aboard. All
of them i.-ana-ed to reach the shore.
Several hours later one of the boats
containing Captain Peabody and two
sailors, who did not get off until long
after daybreak yesterday morning, was
capsized in the surf, but they all man
to Bret ashore with the assistance
hundred or more volunteers from
Half-moon Bay who had remained on
the beach all night anxiously waiting
an opportunity to assist in rescuing the
crew.
The sea was running high at the
time the New York went ashore and it
was impossible to launch any of the
ship's boats. An attempt was made
about midnight to launch a lifeboat.
The waves dashed it against the iron
Fides of the ship and broke it into

realizing that it was useless to again
attempt to launch a boat until the
storm had in a measure abated, quieted
the crew as best he could. The people
on the beach could hear the voice of
the captain commanding the crew, but
could not make themselves heard, as
a howling wind was blowing from the
ocean. They waited as patiently as
they could until the first boat was suc
cessfully launched at 2:40 o'clock this
morning v.ith the captain's wife and
little daughter and eleven of the crew
â in command of Mate Callip. For a
Tew moments it looked as if the boat
would capsize in the surf. Several of
the rescuers on the beach became so
excited that they waded out above
their waists into the water and suc
ceeded in throwing a rope to the ter
rified passengers of the boat. The rope
was auickly fastened to the boat and

with the assistance of willing hands
hauled to the shore.
Mate Callip immediately wanted to
j return to the New York to assist in res
i cuing those still on board. Not a few
! of the people who went dawn to the
I beach carried large quantities of whis
ky with them. This was greedily
! drunk by the majority of the sailors
I rescued, and they refused in their
j drunken stupor to attempt ot rescue
I their shipmates. Mate Callip pleaded
! with them to be more humane, but they
I would not listen to him. They bluntly
: refused to leave the beach, and it was
j after 6 o'clock before Callip could get
| a sufficient crew to- go back with him
;to the New York. The rescue trip was
I successfully made and six more sailors
! were brought ashore. In getting in the
boat one of the Japanese had his leg
broken by having it crushed against
the side of the ship.
The storm had somewhat abated at
10:30 o'clock, and the captain and two
of the sailors came ashore, carrying:
j with them many of the personal effects
!of the captain and his wife. A rope
i fastened to the boat was held by res
cuers on the beach. When the signa!
was given them to pull the men gave a
sudden Jerk, the boat slung to one side
and a heavy breaker striking It just

at that minute capsized it. The men
got safely ashore, but all of the goods
they had in the boat went to the bot
tom.
Captain Peabody when asked as to
tho cause of the disaster said that he
could only account for it on the ground
that the New York had a stormy pas
sage from Hongkong, was dismasted in
a gale, March 1, and her helm so badly
damaged that it was practically use
less. He said that he had been stand
ing out some little time and finally de
termined to try to reach port. About 6
o'clock he sent a man aloft who re
ported back to him that he thought he
could discern ahead of them the light
of Point Bonita.
Just about that time he encountered
a heavy southerly current and was
unable to put out to sea, as his helm
would not respond. He did not anti
cipate any particular danger, believing
himself near Point Bonita, and when
first the New York drifted in on the
beach he did not know exactly where
he was, as it was dark at the time. In
fact, it was so dark he could not dis
cern the outlines of the cliff above the
beach, although not over 300 yards from
it. He believes that it must have been
about 8 o'clock when the vessel struck
He Immediately sent up signals of dis
tress and about an hour later people I
come down on the beach. Every wave
breaking over the side of the New York
seemed to drive her deeper and deeper
into the sand.
Mate Callip earned the hearty praises
of all the people of Halfmoon Bay by
reason of the courageous spirit shown
by him. Callip had been sick for sev
eral days prior to the wreck, and after
first reaching the shore was taken with
a severe hemorrhage. Despite his
weakened condition he wanted to re
turn to the vessel with the lifeboat to
get the rest of the crew off, but was
unable to do so because of the drunken
stubbornness of those who had been
rescued.
Mate Callip. in conversation with The
Call correspondent, said that while he
had followed the sea for many years he
never experienced such a stormy voyage
as on the New York. "We left Hongkong
on January 14 last," said he, "and I can
safely say that we did not have six
pleasant days. We encountered head
winds and high seas all during the voy
age. It took us thirty days to make
Yokohama. We thought then that we
might encounter better weather, but
there was no improvement. In fact, it
became worse.
"The New York rolled and tossed
days at a time in heavy gales, and I at
times thought that we would never see
land again. We came near not seeing
it. On March 1 we encountered a ter
rific storm and our masts were carried
away. Our helm had been bad enough
before that. From that time on the New
York could not be made to readily re
spond to her helm. When we struck
the heavy southerly current last night
we were unable to get away from it.
The vessel would not respond. I should
Judge that the current was running at
the rate of about five knots an hour. It
had been hazy from noon time on and
we did not know exactly where we
were. About 6 o'cloo' the lookout re
ported that he believed he could see the
lights of Point Bonlta ahead. The cap
tain next went aloft. He was of the
same opinion as the former lookout.
That we were a long distance away
from Point Bonita we learned to our
sorrow when we struck Halfmoon Bay
beach.
"The New York was recently bought
by a New York company and sent to
Hongkong, where I joined her. She was
formerly known as the T. F. Oakes
and was the first American iron ship
built. I joined her, acting under the
advice of my physician. I had been
sick for quite a while and he advised
me to visit California. "When the op
portunity was afforded me of sailing
on the New York I gladly accepted it.
Many a day when we were rolling and
tossing at the mercy of h^ad winds I
sincerely wished that I had rema.ined
in Hongkong. I was sick a considerable
portion of the time, and to make mat
ters worse I have now lost all my per
sonal effects, worth $.'OO or $600.
"I doubt very much if it will be pos
sible to do anything to save the vessel.
The waves swept over her all night
Sunday and must have badly damaged
if not entirely destroyed her cargo. I
went aboard her at 10 o'clock to-day,
and at that time there was between 9

WRECK OF THE NEW YORK FROM THE BEACH.
THE PRESIDENT
IS TALKING PEACE
AND DIPLOMACY
There Is a Movement on Foot to Ad
journ Congress and Permit a Syndi
cate of Capitalists to Buy
Cuban Freedom.
NEW YORK, March 14â
The Herald's Washington corre
spondent telegraphs: In a night
and a day a great change has
come over t,he situation, as it is
viewed at the White House.
No one could talk with the
President to-day without notic
ing that the air speedily became
surcharged with peace talk, ema
nating from the executive man
sion.
President McKinley, as re
cently as Saturday, was deeply
impressed with the gravity of the
situation, but he said to several
persons who talked with him to
day:
"I do not expect war. I be
lieve this whole matter can be
settled diplomatically."
The official mind of Washington is
puzzling over the shift. It is known the
situation last week became most serious
on the day after it became apparent
through inquiries made by the Herald
that the proposition to have the Cubans
purchase their independence and the
United States guarantee two hundred
million;-; of bonds would not be enter
tained by Congress.
The President had hoped that this
plan would meet with favor. It can be
stated on authority that the scheme had
been cleverly mapped out by Senator
Elkins and considered in great detail,
but the views entertained by members
of Congress led to its being abandoned.
Then everything took on a gloomy
tinge.
The changed atmosphere from gravity
to gayety once more is due to the revi
val of the purchase proposition in a
new form. If the insurgents are willing
that their freedom should be bought for
them, what difference should it make
whether the purchase is made through
the United States or through some
other agency? I understand that the
suggestion now is to have a great syn
dicate of American and European capi
talists organized for the purpose of pur
chasing Cuba.
This is the biggest news development
since the first purchase proposition was
killed last week. The financial interests
of the world do not want war. They do
not believe it is necessary. Probably the
leading reason lies in the condition of
the Spanish national debt.
But to give reasons is not necessary.
The fact is sufficient. The men who

NEW YORK. March 14.â The
Key West correspondent of the
Press says authoritatively that
a shattered section of the sub
marine cable that connected
the mine under the Maine has

sion of the Board of Inquiry.
The cable contains seven copper
â wires and was discovered about
thirty feet from the submerged

EUROPE MAY INTERFERE
IN BEHALF OF SPAIN.
LONDON, March 15.â According to information obtained from
good sources the Austrian Emperor is making great efforts to in
duce the European powers to present to the United States the
danger to Europe of carrying out any further interference in Cuban
affairs.
Emperor William is warmly seconding the efforts of Emperor
Francis Joseph. The American Government is aware of this situa
tion.
The Vienna correspondent of the Times telegraphs an abstract
of an article in the St. Petersburg Novoe Vremya, which he thinks
deserves attention as giving an accurate account of the views and
Intentions of at least three of the great powers.
The correspondent says: "The article asserts that the United
States is well aware that in declaring war against Spain it could
not count upon the approval of any of the European powers. All,
it alleges, would sympathize with Spain, if not actively, certainly by
categorical protests against President McKinley's conduct. This is
also well known at Madrid.
"Therefore." continues the Novoe Vremya. writer, "it is hoped
Spain will not fall into the trap laid by Washington, for she has so
far no serious grounds for declaring war and measures should im
mediately be taken in order that she may not have such grounds in
the future.
"The European representatives," concludes the article, "will no
tify the Washington Government of their opinion that war is not
desirable; and it is to be hoped that President McKinley will re
alize the disadvantage of such general censure and will not allow
himself to be egged into war by American speculators."

HOLLANDS BOAT
MAKES A LONG RUN.
Splendid Behavior of the Submarine
Vessel That May Bevolution
ize Naval Warfare.
NEW YORK, March 14.â The sub
marine torpedo-boat Holland left her
dock at Perth Amboy to-day and made
a run out into the bay. She was gone
about half an hour, and, according to
Mr. Holland, behaved splendidly. No
attempt was made to dive. When the
Holland returned to her dock a number
of men began the work >>f putting in
her pig iron ballast. When this work
is completed it will bring the boat down
to a normal water line. The Holland
probably will take a short run to-mor
row or next day to test the lay of the
ballast.
In an interview to-night Mr. Holland
said: "The experiments made with
the boat show that she is a thorough
success. The boat did everything I ex
ported it to do. A speed of about six
miles an hour was made to-day, but the
boat is capable of much greater speed
than that. I shall continue to make ex
periments with her for the next two
weeks, so that when I have finished
them I will be perfectly sure of her. I
can say nothing of what disposition I
shall make of the boat."

and 10 feet of water in her hold. Her
plates are considerably sprung. She is
lying in a bed of quicksand and may
at any minute turn over. I do not
think it possible for the tugs to get her
off. The beach of Half-moon Bay will
in all probability be her graveyard."
The crew of the New York is being
cared for at the hotel in Halfmoon Bay
proper. Captain Peabody, his wife and
child are staying in a private
house. The captain says that he will
not go to San Francisco until some dis
position has been made of the ship and
cargo. Several underwriters and in
surance adjusters arrived at the scene
of the wreck to-night to see if there is
any possibility of either floating the
vessel or having her hauled off the
beach by tugs. A heavy sea was break
in? over her at tho time and it became
dark before they had an opportunity of
getting a good view of the surround
ings.
Thoy will go down to the beach to
morrow morning to make another sur
vey of the situation. They fear that j
a heavy northerly gale, such as was j
experienced last week, will mean the !
total breaking-up of the vessel.
NOTED FOR DISASTER,
MUTINY AND MURDER.
Thrilling and Unlucky Career of the
Iron Ship That Is Ashore in
Halfmoon Bay.
"The New York is hard and fast on
the beach at Halfmoon Bay," said
Captain Gilbert Brokaw of the. tug Re
liance last night. "As soon as I got
there yesterday morning I saw there
was no chance of saving the vessel. She (
ivas sunk eight feet in the sand, there :
â was nine feet of water in her hold and
the sandbar is being formed outside the i
vessel that will do away with any
chance of ever getting her into deep
water again.
"When the Xew York went ashore
Bhe was under a jib and foretopmast
staysail, foresail, lower foretopsail, up
per and lower jnain topsail and mizzen
lower topsail. "When the Reliance got
there the jib and foretopmast staysail
had been run down, the mainsail was
half set and the sheets and tacks of the
foresail had broken and that sail was
flying out to the wind. The vessel must
have teen driven ashore bow on and
then turned broadside to the shore by
the force of the wind and the waves.
Both the anchors were at the bow so
there was either no time or probably no
thought of dropping either of them.
"The crew had run a line from the I
ship to the beach when I got ashore,
and they were working one of the ships
boats between the wreck and the shore
by means of it. It was calm between
the ship and the beach, but the waves
which swept around the bow and thÂ«Â»
stern made a very strong current which
sometimes capsized the boat during its
journey backward and forward. Dur
ing one trip with Captain Peabody the
boat capsized and the great bulk of the
captain's effects, including his wife's
Bewing machine, was dumped Into the
water. The men that were in the boat
were saved, but at one time it looked
as if the boat would drift out to sea.
One of the crew, a big Kanaka, took a
rope, however, and swam out to the
boat. He made the rope fast to it, and
then getting astride the half-submerged
craft was pulled ashore. All Spanish
town took a holiday to view the wreck.
The school children were marched
down to the beach in a body, and after
gazing on the scene for a couple of
hours were marched back to school
again.
"Captain Peabody was very reticent
as to the cause of the disaster, but the
men say that Mate Kerr, who was on
watch, called the captain half an hour
before he showed up on deck. From
what I cc-uld gather the ship had been
on and off Halfmoon Bay for three
days and once had been very close in
shore. She stood off ten or twleve
miles, but in spite of the northwest
wind that was blowing she came right
back to her old stamping ground and,
much to the surprise of everybody,
went ashore. Captain Peabody blames
the strong currents. He says there
should be a light on Pillar Point.
"The British ship Clan Galbraith,
from San Francisco for Cork with a
cargo of wheat, had a narrow escape
of laying her bones alongside the New
York. She was within three miles of
the beach and just when in the most
danger she managed to head off on a
starboard tack and just cleared Pigeon
Point by a hair's breadth. For half an
hour it was touch and go with her, and
I delayed my departure for San Fran
cisco, thinking that 'every minute it
would require my assistance. Captain
Hodgman of the Life-saving Station at
Fort Point did every thing he possibly
could for the crew of the New York.
He took all kinds of chances in saving
the men's kits and was time and again
up to his waist in water while paving
stuff from the wreck."
The American ship New York, late
the T. F. Oakes, has been one of the
most unfortunate vessels that ever left
the stocks. Misfortune followed her
from ths day she was launched in Phil
adelphia, until she laid her bones on the
beach at HaTfmoon Bay. When eije
was loaded and ready to sail from Phil
adelphia for Port Townsend on her
maiden voyage old sailors said that she
would have a terrible time of it round
, ing the Horn. At that time she was
| the loftiest sparred ship in the world
I and the aid sailors' predictions came
i true. She was dismasted on that voy
j age and put into Valparaiso in dis-
I tress. She was repaired and started
| again for Puget Sound, but again the
! masts were blown out of her and she
was towed back to Valparaiso for the
; second time. On her third attempt she
got well up the Pacific coast, but was
i caught in another gale off Columbia
! River and finally had to be tawed to
i Port Townsend in distress.
On her second voyage she was sent
! out to China and was caught in a ty
i phoon and nearly wrecked. She was
i thrown on her beam ends, and a
! steamer picked her up and towed her
into Hongkong.
The latter part of 1896 she started
I from China for New York, and was 864
I days making the trip. She was so
j long overdue that she was given up for
lost, and 80 guineas per cent rein
surance was paid on her. During that
voyage some of the crew died from
j scurvy, and nearly all the others were
kslck from the disease that they
Id not work the ship, and had to
driven to their stations with ropes
s and belaying pins. It is as a
rd ship," therefore, that the New
k is best known. She never made
an American port without the captain
or mate be\ng arrested for beating
the men. As a- general rule they got
off, but the trip from Hongkong set
tled the captain and the mate, both of
whom were punished by the Federal
Court of New York.
In May, 1893, Captain Reid and First
Mate McKay of the Oakes (now the
New York) were arrested on twenty
eight charges in San Francisco. Six
seamen gave evidence and showed the
wounds inflicted by the officers, but
both of them got off on a technicality.
In February. 1895. Captain Reid and
Second Mate Ross were arrested in
San Francisco on a charge of extreme
cruelty and murder. Frederick Owens,
able seaman, was assaulted, dragged
out of the forecastle and compelled to
work during the very cold weather off
Cape Horn, notwithstanding that he
complained of sickness. Owens couldn't
work, but was ordered to "walk the
deck." He was given no medical aid,
except a dose of salts and a mustard
| plaster. Two days later he died. Later
i"a simple minded Swede" named J.
; Johnson failed to address the second
mate as "sir," and was knocked down
and kicked in the eye by Captain
Id. The second mate ran away to
ape trial, and the captain was
.in acquitted on a technicality,
fter that the ship went to Na
mo, B. C, to load coal for Santa
Rosalia, and four crews deserted one
after the other before she could get
away. Then came the fearful voyage
from China, and that sickened even
the owners. The name of the ship was
changed to New York, and an entire
new crew, with Captain Peabody as
master, was put aboard of her. He had
been successful as master of the Tarn
o' Shanter, and during one voyage left
New York the same day as the Shenan
doah, and they both came in through
the Golden Gate together in the fast
time of 111 days. Captain Peabody
made one trip in the Sintram after
leaving the Tarn o' Shanter and then
he accepted command of the New
York. But his advent did not relieve
the "hoodoo." After leaving Hong
kong she lost her foremast in a gale
and had to put back for repairs. A
second start was made, but misfortune
again overtook her. In another gale
she lost her foretopgallant mast and
foretopsail yard, and altogether there
were five serious accidents during the
Captain Peabody had his hands full
during the voyage. His crew became
mutinous, and the belaying-pln had to
be used occasionally in order to get any
work out of the men.
The New York and the Tillie E.
Starbuck were sister ships, but there
the resemblance ends, as the former
has been a continuous failure while the
Starbuck has been a success. The New
York was an iron ship, built by the
American Ship Building Company of
Philadelphia in 1883. She was 255 feet
long, 40 feet 6 inches broad and 23 feet
5 inches deep. She was 1897 tons
burden and had aboard the following
cargo consigned to Williams, Dimond

Success of the Experiment Being
â¢ Tried Near Stockton.
STOCKTON, March 14.â Engineer Fish
er, who has had charge of the experiment
of building a roadway across the tule
lands between this city and the Contra
Costa Hills, has become convinced that
the experiment of building an earth em
bankment of facings laid over the soft,
muddy tule ground will be a success. He
has just finished putting on two more
barges of sand on the experimental piece
made several weeks ago, and he says it
stands the pressure so perfectly that he
no longer has doubts of the success of the
experiment.

REACHING FOR
FOOTBALL MEN
The Butte Eleven Finds a
Dangerous Rival in
Anaconda.
Marcus Daly, trio Football "Angel,,
and His Novel and Costly
Hobby.
First it was Butte that reached out
its tentacles for our football players
and whisked them across the plains to
a mountain home. McMillan was the
first to go; Benson followed and others
shook the dust of San Francisco off
their heels for positions in Butte with
good salaries attached, with the under
standing that all idle moments were
to be utilized on the gridiron.
Now Butte has a rival city in Ana
conda, another of Montana's sporting
towns, and there will be a regular auc
tion bidding for our football men be
fore the season is over.
The 'â¢angel" of the Butte team is
young Clarke, whose father was mayor
of the city and whose wealth is esti
mated at $10,000,000 or more. Football
teams are his hobby and he carries
them ai- :nd the country on specials,
furnishing them with all the comforts
and conveniences of a well-stocked and
well-equipped club-house. Anaconda
has municipal aspirations to be the
biggest city in Montana, to supplant
Butte on every field. Another Clarke
has been found and his name is Marcus

the four quarters of the globe, became
a sonorous trumpeteer of the city s ath

ceived the same idea and in another
month she will have a football team
as heterogeneous and as costly as that
Of DaYy began to reach out for our men
a few months ago. So far he has se

we have, Pete Smith and Burt Oliver.
Smith will leave this city on Tuesday
for Anaconda, where he has a choice
of two commercial positions in the
Anaconda Mining Company. Burt Oli
ver will follow him soon after The
bait offered these men is a good, sub
stantial salary, with Just enough labor
attached to make it worth the -while
for thTsan Francisco men to forego

existence colored with the soil of the
Oliver are the only play
ers secured at the present time. But it
is thought that Sexton will soon follow.
Overtures have been made to bimpson,
and it is very likely that he wJHac
cept upon his graduation from Medical
College in the summer. Carter is an
other whose name is on the list of can
didates for the new Anaconda eleven,
which it is expected will sweep every
thing before it on the gridiron. Sev
eral Eastern players of reputation are
already in Anaconda awaiting the
opening of the season.
Phil Daniels, the manager of the An
aconda eleven, promises great things
for the men who will wear his uniform.
First there will be the season in Mon
tana, the feature of which will be the
games between the rival cities. After
that will come a trip East, where the
new team from Anaconda will line up
against the big elevens of the coun
try. Then it is the intention of the An
aconda enthusiasts to traverse the con
tinent and play our local teams during
the Christmas holidays.
When the local athletic clubs prepare
to form their teams this year they will
find big gaps in places that were al
ways filled. Smith was looked upon as
prospective captain of the Olympic
eleven. Oliver, Sexton, Carter and
Simpson would have played in athletic
club teams this fall, and, as the ma
terial is not superabundant, their ab
sence will be felt. Instead of a visit
from one Montana team during the
j winter, we might now have a brace to
! fight out their own differences on our
i soil.

PERKINS WANTS
NO FAVORITISM
Charges War Department
Officials With Dis
crimination.
Pacific Coast Factories Ignored
in the Letting of
Contracts.
Could Supply War Munitions for
Less Than the Government
Now Pays.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 14.
Senator Perkins was at the War De
partment yesterday, and saw General
Miles and General Flagler in an at
tempt to get the department to award
to Pacific Coast manufacturers some of
the contracts for gun carriages, fixed
ammunition and smokeless powder.
Senator Perkins told these officials that
there were a number of California
firms that could rapidly turn out the
Crozier-Buffington ordnance carriage as
cheaply as they could be manufactured
in any part of the United States. He
tried to convince them that there was
no use in paying a cent or a cent and
a half a pound for the transportation
of these carriages to the Pacific Coast
from the East. He requested that in
the future, when letters were sent to
the various manufacturers inviting bids
for this work, the Pacific Coast found
ries be given an equal chance to com
pete for the contracts. Senator Perkins
says there seems to be no reason for
the high prices charged for these gun
carriages.
"You can buy a first-class Baldwin
locomotive for $12,000," said he to The
Call correspondent to-night; "yet these
Eastern manufacturers charge the Gov
ernment $28,000 for Crozier-Bufflngton
carriages for 12-inch guns, about $17,000
for the carriages for the 10-inch guns
and $9000 for the 8-inch guns. These
chaVges are extortionate, and I did nol
hesitate to say so to the War Depart
ment officials. There Is no reason in
the world why the carriages should not
be built as well and more cheaply by
our Pacific Coast manufacturers, and I
propose to keep hammering at the de
partment until our coast people are
given the same opportunity to bid for
these contracts that Eastern firms
have.
"And there is the question of powder,
too. There is more than one factory
in California that can manufacture
smokeless powder according to the
Government formula. I am aware that
it is the general understanding that
only one firm in this country has as
yet succeeded in turning out an article
equal to the Russian powder, and that
the Duponts have failed, but this is a
mistake. It is no great trick to manu
facture smokeless powder according to
this formula, and we have at least four
firms in California that can do it.
"Formerly the United States has paid
one dollar a pound/for this powder and
it now proposes to pay eighty-five cents
when the same powder is manufactured
in European countries for forty-five
cents. And then, too, I told the
War Department officials to-day that
our Pacific Coast manufacturers should
be given a chance to compete for the
contracts for furnishing the Govern
ment with fixed ammunition. I think
that our coast firms would at least be
able to turn out all of the shells and
projectiles for use on our coast."
Senator Perkins is evidently of the
opinion that there is some favoritism
shown to Eastern firms by the Ord
nance Department, and unless the Cal
ifornia and Pacific Coast factories are
hereafter allowed to compete, he pro
poses to stir the matter up in the Sen
ate. Although the Senator did not say
so, he is evidently of the opinion that
"something is rotten" in the adminis
tration of our Ordnance Department.
This is significant, too. from the fact
that The Call correspondent's interview
with the Senator occurred immediate
ly after he had had a long talk with
General Miles.
It may be said that the general com
manding the army has long been of
the opinion that a reform is needed in
the administration of the two ord
nance bureaus. It is believed that
Senator Perkins will bring the matter
to the attention of the Senate immedi
ately.
FOR IMPROVEMENT OF
CALIFORNIA RIVERS.
Congressmen Ask That a Suitable
Appropriation Be Made in the
Sundry Civil Bill.
WASHINGTON, March 14.â Senator
Perkins and Representatives Maguire,
De Vries, Barham and Hilborn to-day
appeared before the Senate Committee
on Appropriations and urged that a
provision be placed in the sundry civil
bill allowing the appropriation made
by the Legislature of California for
the improvement of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers to be available
without awaiting a similar appropria
tion by the national Government. This
will allow the State to begin work on
these rivers at once, but It requires
the consent of the Federal authorities
as the rlversj are under Federal juris
diction.
Senator Perkins and Representative
De Vries also asked to have the ap
propriation recommended by the
Treasury Department of $81,000 for
completing the Stockton Postoffice.
They will als make an effort to have
the De Vries Yosemite bill made a part
of the sundry civil appropriation bill.

NEW YORK, March 14.â Civil Engineer
A. G. Menocal of the navy. whosÂ« court
martial was to begin to-morrow, is still
under the care of a physician. The trial
will probably be postponed until further
orders. Mr. "Menocal is to be tried on two
charges, one of culpable inefficiency in
the performance of duty, and the other,
neglect of duty. Both are founded on the
work done in the construction of the new
dry dock. Mr. Menocal recently returned
from Nicaragua, where he had been with
the commission appointed by President
McKinley to inspect and survey the canal
and its tributary waters. He suffered a
slight stroke of paralysis while on his

FOR EIGHT
NEW CUTTERS
Senate Passes the Bill to
Construct Revenue
Vessels.
Report of the Naval Court of
Inquiry Awaited in the
Maine Investigation.
Passage of a Resolution to Seek In
demnity From Spain for Injury
Done to Two Americans.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 14.
During its session of three hours to
day the Senate passed a considerable
number of bills from the general cal
endar. A bill was passed authorizing
the Secretary of the Treasury to have
constructed eight vessels for the reve
nue cutter service, as follows: One to
take the place of the steamer Seward,
cost not to exceed $160,000; one to take
the place of the McLane, cost not to
exceed $160,000; one to take the place of
the Coif ax, cost not to exceed $160,000;
one to take the place of the Boutwell,
cost not to exceed $160,000; one for ser
vice on and in the vicinity of the Co
lumbia River bar. Pacific Coast, cost
not to exceed $250,000; one for harbor
service at Philadelphia to replace the
steamer Washington, cost not to ex
ceed $45,000; one for harbor service at
Boston to replace the steamer Hamlin,
cost not to exceed $45,000; one for har
bor service at New York to replace the
Chandler, cost not to exceed $45,000.
A resolution offered last Thursday by
Chandler of New Hampshire, approving
the course of the committee in the inves
tigation of the Maine disaster, was
adopted.
Almost immediately afterward Allen of
Nebraska inquired of Chandler what the
Naval Affairs Committee had done re
garding the investigation of the Maine
catastrophe provided for in his resolu
tion of several weeks ago.
Chandler said that as yet the commit
tee had taken no action regarding the in
vestigation. He could not speak for the
committee, but expressed the opinion that
its policy would be to await the action
and findings of the Naval Court of In
quiry. He called attention to the inter
esting fact that naval courts have no
authority, under the law, to compel wit
nesses to testify or to punish them if
they should refuse. He thought, there
fore, that the Naval Committee, in mak
ing its investigation, ought to be em
powered to force testimony from wit
nesses or to make them suffer a pen
alty for refusal.
"Is the Senator advised as to whether
the Naval Affairs Committee will make
an investigation of the Maine disaster?"
inquired Allen.
"I am not prepared to speak for the
committee," replied Chandler. "The reso
lution, I take it, places an injunction upon
the committee to conduct an investiga
tion, and the resolution agreed to a few
minutes ago is in line with that injunc
tion. This is a subject which I do not
think ought to be discussed in public. I
desire to commend the Senator from
Nebraska for his patriotic restraint in re
fraining to discuss this matter."
The conference report on the army ap
propriation bill was reported by Quay
CRep.) of Pennsylvania and was agreed
to.
Proceeding, under unanimous consent,
the Senate paused the following meas
ures: Amending an act to permit the use
of the right of way through public lands
for tram roads, canals and reservoirs;
permanently locating the capital of the
Territory of New Mexico at Santa Fe;
granting to the Kettle River Valley Rail
way Company a right of way through the
north half of the Colville Indian Reserva
tion in Washington; and relating to
leases on the Hot Springs reservation.
At this point Lodge of Massachusetts
of the Foreign Relations Committee
called up the joint resolution for the re
lief of August Bolton and Gustave Riche
lieu.
The resolution, as reported from the
Foreign Relations Committee, is as fol
lows:
"That the President of the United
State be and hereby is empowered to
take such measures as in his judgment
may be necessary to obtain the indem
nity from the Spanish Government for
the wrong and injury suffered by August
Bolton and Gustave Richelieu through
their wrongful imprisonment by the
Spanish in Santiago de Cuba in the year
1595, and to secure this end he is author
ized and requested to employ such means
or exercise such power as may be neces
sary."
The resolution was passed.

SEATTLE, March 14.â Joseph Schwartz,
the "Diamond King," is again free. This
is by reason of the fact that to-day Gov
ernor Rogers Mfused to honor the request
of Governor Jwidd. The authortitie3 of
San Francisco desired Schwartz on a
charge of grand larceny. The Governor
refused to deliver Schwartz into the
hands of Detective Wren on the advice of
the Attorney-General, who decided that
the grounds for requisition were not suf
ficient. The prosecuting attorney of this
county expresses amazement at what he
terms the unprecedented action of Gov

HAVANA, March 14.â Several en
gagements are officially reported in
Pinar del Rio, Havana, Matanzas and
Santa Clara provinces. General Blanco
has sent an official cable to the Mm!
! ister of War congratulating Generala
Pando, Varo del Rey and Linares for
their successful operations against tha
rebels at Sierrra Maestra, Palma, Sori
ano Dos Palma, Juacate la Esperanza
and around Camarones Rives, Bicana,
Cabo, Cruz and Canto River, on March
7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.
The Havana papers announce without
comment that the battle-ship lowa will
pay a friendly visit to Havana.
Insurgents fired this evening on a
train which left Matanzas in the aft
ernoon for Havana. Two men were
slightly wounded. One was George
Barnum, a British subject, who lived
for some years in Savannah, Ga. The
other was the Civil Secretary of Ma
tanzas. Mr. Barnum, who was with
his wife, had been stopping for some
days in Havana and to-day went to
Matanzas to investigate the condition
of the reconcentradoes.
Mrs. Barnum has devoted much of
her time to relief work. The train was
attacked first while running between
Jaruco and San Miguel, but the guer
rillas were quickly repulsed by soldiers
in an armored car next to the engine.
Between San Miguel and Campo Flor
ida the train was attacked by anothef
band, which was quickly driven off by
the prompt work of the Spanish sol
diers. Some bullets passed through the
passenger car. One struck Mr. Bar
num in the left shoulder, inflicting a
flesh wound. When the train arrived in
this city he was taken to the Hotel
i Belot, where his wound was attended
j to by Dr. Dudley of the American Con
i sulate.
Pursuing parties started immediately
after the insurgents, who made toward
Tapaste Hills. I understand that the
raid was made by B^tancourt's troops.
Wreckers recovered one of the battle
i ship Maine's six-pound guns to-day.
i and will proceed to take up the 6-inch
| rifles in a few days. One body was
i found to-day in the wreck of the Maine
and some bones and doming. The court
of inquiry held a sesion to day as usual,
and appears to have finished the cvi
i dence regarding particular measure
j ments, as divers and wreckers were
needed as witnesses. The work on the
wreck has proceeded more rapidly. The
members of the court are unable to Bay
when they will leave Havana. The body
found to-day may be that of Her
man or Herbert, as the under
clothing- marks show "Her." There
I are only two men lost to whom the let-
I ters would apply.

VALPARAISO, March 14 â
Since I received the Herald's
first dispatch inquiring about
the possible sale of the Chilean
cruiser O'HigÂ«ins and other war
vessels to Spain I have kept a
special lookout for any news re
garding the report. Information
from official and private sources
continues to confirm my dis
patch of March 2. in which I
stated ar- coming from President
Errazuriz personally that Chile
had no intention of selling the
O'Higgins or any of her war
ships. President Errazuriz told
me this in tho presence of ihe
Ministers of War, Interior, Navy
and Public Instruction and Se
nor Eulojio Altamiro, a prom
inent statesman. President Er
razuriz and Ministers have re
turned to their respective prov
inces, therefore I can get no in
formation from them to-day. I
am informed, however, by sev
eral prominent men that there
is no truth in the latest report
that Spain has purchased the
CTHiggins. They say that Chile
would not dare to sell the O'Kig
gins, as the sale might cause an
outbreak throughout the coun
try against the Government. As
evidence that Chile does not in
tend to sell any of her ships it is
mentioned that Costa Rica tried
to buy the old wooden corvette
Pllcomayo, offering $30,000 for
her. The offer was flatly re
tO4*ed.
Call Office, Riffgs House,
Washington, March 14.
A week's negotiations closed to-day
by the triumphant purchase by the
Navy Department in London of the
two fine cruisers built and building at
Elswick for the Brazilian Govern
ment. Possibly the officials took more
pleasure in closing up the business in
this manner because of the knowledge
that Spanish agents had been striving
to secure these very ships, and that to
Spain, it is said, they would be of much
greater value in case of trouble than
to the United States. The next ques
tion is how to get the ships home, and
that has not yet been settled, according
to the Secretary of the Navy.
The United States flag will be hoisted
over the new ships within a week
probably, and just as soon as the crew
can be put aboard the Amazonas will
start for the United States. The other
vessel will follow at the earliest pos
moment. The terms of the sale
are secret.
The availability of the two Brazilian
ships was first brought to the attention
of the Navy Department by Mr. Lain?,
agent of the Maxim Nordenfeldt Com
pany, who was authorized to dispose
of these ships building at Elswick and
two others in course of construction in
France. Mr. Lame said to-day that
the two ships purchased would be a
most desirable acquisition to the Amer
ican navy, as they were the latest and
best products of the famous Arm
strong yards. One of the ships is com
plete in every respect, has her coal
supply and ammunition on board, and
steam can be raised at any time. There
will be no trouble in bringing this ship
across, as an adequate force from the
local yards can be secured for. the serv
ice. It is said the coal and ammuni
tion on board passed with the sale to
the United States. The ammunition is
not of the kind in use by the American
navy, so that the supply of ammunition
is a ' necessary adjunct to the new
ships. The other ship has been
launched, but it will take some time
to make her ready for sea. Mr. Lame
believes however, that there will be no
difficulty in bringing her over immedi
ately if it is desired to make the move
without delay, as the hull of the ship
is so well along that she could be towed
and her own sail power utilized for the
trip across.
The two Brazilian ships will be ex
tremely valuable additions to the
United States navy in either war or
peace in the opinion of Secretary Long,
who acknowledges they have been
bought by the United States. They are
steel sheathed and coppered, with twin
screws The Amazonas is rated at .iSOO
tons displacement, with an indicated
horsepower, under natural draft of
7000, which is calculated to develop
twenty knots speed. Thus, while the
uhip Is about the size of the Charleston
she is much faster. Her armament is
also much more formidableâ not so
much in caliber, for the main battery
is made up of six 6-inch guns, but these
guns, as well as the 4.7-inch guns, are
of what is known as 60-1 caliber length
giving them an unusual range and
power. In addition to this they have
ten 6-pounder quick-firing guns, four I
pounders, four Maxim machine guns
and two boat or field guns. The tor
pedo tubps are three in number. The
coal capacity is 850 tons, giving her an
effective steaming radius of 8000 knots,
a most valuable feature, inasmuch as
it would enable the ship to cross and
recross the Atlantic without coaling.
Such a vessel used as a commerce de
stroyer would be vastly more effective
than what appears to be more powerful
craft, because of her ability to get
along on long cruises without touching
in at neutral ports to coal and thus ex
posing; her to capture. Â»
The cruisers carry no armor in the
ordinary sense, but their machinery Is
protected from the fire of guns by an
arched steel deck Just below the water
line, varying in thickness from 1.2 to
3.5 inches. The battery has an unusual
train, being arranged to fire three
ahead and three astern of the principal
guns.
A dangerous deficiency in the en
gineer branch of the navy has been
brought to light strikingly in the fact
that it is scarcely possible to secure a
staff of engineer officers to bring back
to the United States any or the ships
purchased abroad. A short time ago,
when orders were given to rush the
work of putting the cruiser Chicago in
shape for active service, the engineer
in chief proposed that he would have
the ship ready in three months instead
of six, as estimated. To do this he
would work forces day and night, and
to keep them at work he would place
an engineer officer aboard the ship, to
stay there day and night. Passed As
sistant Engineer Dixon was chosen for
the work, but he had not been em
ployed more than a week before it was
found necessary to detach him in order
to find an engineer officer to act as a
member of The board appointed to ex
amine auxiliary cruisers.
This state of affairs has been brought
to the attention of the House Naval
Committee, but so far it is feared
without meeting that degree of success
which it was hoped for, in the shape of
an amendment increasing the number
of engineer officers in the service.
HUNDREDS TRYING
JOIN THE NAVY.
But Great Care Is Taken in Selecting
Recruits, and Few Applicants
Are Accepted.
WASHINGTON, March 14.â The newly ;
established recruiting station at the navy
yard here shows great activity. The
emergency methods of accepting- any man i
who makes application has not yet be- j
come necessary, and. therefore, the work i
is slow. .During 1 the past few days there
fc*ve been two men accepted out of the
hundreds of applicants.
Everything which is available as fight
ing material is placed in a condition to be
used readily, and Captain Robinson stated â 
that orders had been received to prepare !
for qui^k movements. Rations sufficient
for several flays have been put in port- |
aMe shape, and within half an hour after i
receiving orders to move, the entire body !
of the marine corps could respond to the '
call.
To-morrow there will leave for the Min
neapolis, which is at League Island, two
corporals, 266 privates and two musicians.
Though the two new regiments which
have been authorized to be formed exist
as yet only on paper, they can be filled
within sixteen hours, and two hours later
could be formed in marching order.
HANNA'S ENEMIES
HARD AT WORK.
Seek to Control the Coming Republi-
can Convention in Ohio.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 14.â James
W. Holcomb, one of the members of the
Republican committee of fifteen in this
city and an active lieutenant for Senator
Hanna in the recent Senatorial contest
before the Legislature, is authority for
the statement that the Bushnell and
Kurtz forces the marshaled for another
battle.
Delegates to the next Republican State
Convention will soon be chosen. Those
from the county will be selected In coun
ty convention nr-xt Saturday. Mr.
Holcomb saye he has evidence to show
that Mayor McKisson will try to cap
ture the County Convention, and that the
Bushnetl and Kurtz men will do the same
the State over. With the State Conven
tion in their hands, the alleged plan is to
indorse the action of the Republicans who
bolted Senator Hanna in the Legislature,
condemn the flection of Senator Hanna
as brought about by improper means,
and appoint a State Republican Com
mittee which will be antagonistic not
only to Senator Hanna, but to President
McKlnley, one of the alms being to har
ass the President as much as possible if
he comes up for re-election.
MOVEMENTS OF THE
WAR VESSELS.
The Marblehead Was Ordered to Key
West Simply to Take Stores on
for the Atlantic Squadron.
WASHINGTON, March 14.â 1t is now
stated at the Navy Department that I
the Marblehead, which arrived at Tarn- i
pa Saturday night, was ordered to that
place simply to tnke on some stores for i
the North Atlantic squadron. The tor- 1
pedo boat Foote arrived at Charleston j
yesterday on her way to Key West to !
join the flotilla. The Fern sailed yes- j
terday from Sagua for Key West, hay- !
ing, it is presumed, delivered all the i
stores for the starving reconcentrados j
which have so far been received from !
the central relief committee in New
York. The battleship lowa came over j
from Tortugas to Key Went yesterday, j
The gunboat Annapolis has arrived at j
Curacoa. The training ship Essex has
sailed from New York for Portsmouth.
HURRY ORDER^FOR
A SIXiNCH GUN.
Weapon to Be Shipped From Brook
lyn to San Francisco for Use on
the Philadelphia.
NEW YORK, March 14.â A hurry
order was received at the Brooklyn
Navy-yard to-day from Washington
for a 6-inch gun to be sent immediately
to San Francisco. The gun is a large
rapid-fire breech-loading rifle which
has been on the receiving ship Ver
mont. The work of transferring the gun
commenced at once.
The officers at the navy-yard were
reticent as to what the gun was needed
for at San Francisco, but it was re
ported that there is something wrong
with one of the grans of the cruiser
Philadelphia and this gun is Intended
to replace it. The gun will go by rail
direct to the Mare Island Navy-yard.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, MARCH 15, 1898.
INSPECTING
BIG STEAMERS
No Time Lost by the
Auxiliary Board in
Beginning Work.
Liners St. Louis and New York
Examined and Found Fit
for Naval Service.
Many Offers Received From tho
Owners of All Kinds of Steam
Craft at Now York.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 14.â The Auxil
iary Cruisers Board of the United
States Navy, which was appointed to
acquire ships of the merchant marine
for use in the event of the breaking
out of the wsi' met for organization
to-day in the Havemeyer building,
where It has secured temporary quar
ters. Permanent quarters will be taken
later, as the board will have a great
amount of work to do here.
The board inspected the St. Louis
and the New York of the American
line this afternoon. The visit to the
St. Louis was a short one. The steam
ship was constructed under the super
vision of naval experts, and all of the
officers composing- the board were fa
miliar with the plan of the vessel.
The New York was next visited. She
was constructed when the company
i sailed its ships under the British flag.
t The New York was at one time In the
I ref , erV e of the British Admiralty and
j was built under the supervision of Eng
lish officers. The inspection of all ves
sels on which the Government has op
! tions by reason of the subsidy act will
! be proceeded with as rapidly as pob
; sible.
Captain Rodgers has very positive ln
1 struct ions to make thorough inspec
tions and immediately report. He has
I been directed to examine all steamships
j available far auxiliary cruisers and
I transports, fast tugs for use as rams
; and steam yachts that could be quickly
transferred into serviceable torpedo-
I boats. He has been instructed also to
telegraph his recommendations to the
Secretary of the Navy, so that action
i may be taken without unnecesssary de
: lay.
It was said by a member of the board
this morning that the department's
' orders were "hurry up" orders and that
i the work of the board would be com
i pleted as expeditlously as possible.
How soon that would be he could not
tell. "Possibly," he added, "we shall
i be through in three days."
Another member of the board said:
I "Just as soon as our mission here was
announced we began to receive offers
! from the steamship companies. The
I owners of all the available American
| steamships in the harbor, I believe I
| am safe in saying, have placed their
: vessels at our disposal. Merchant ves
sels, tugs and yachts are included in
this. We had a particularly large nu.m
i ber of yachts offered to us, and we wiJl,
j no doubt, enter into negotiations for a
| number of these.
Captain A. Griscom, president of the
International Navigation Company,
owners of the American line, was in
consultation with the board in refer
j ence to the St/ Louis. What the result
[ of that consultation was could not be
learned. It was said by a member of
! the board that nothing had been deeid
! cd. The St. Louis Is advertised to sail
i on Wednesday, but it was admitted by
i an official of the company this morning
| that he did not know whether or not
; she would. Lieutenant-Commander
i Kelly declined to say that the steamer
| would be held in this port.
With Havana distant only eighty
miles from Key West and 1250 miles
from New York, the United States
should be able to keep a naval proces
sion going between this country and
Cuba with very little difficulty and
small expense compared with Spain,
which is about 2000 miles away from
the center of operations. This close
proximity to Cuba gives this country
a decided advantage for its naval ves
sels and transports, as they may al
ways be sure of getting fuel, without
which modern ships of war are more
helpless than those of forty years ago.
The possessions erf Spain in the West
Indies, other than Cuba, are Porto Rico
and the Virgin Islands, but neither of
the latter have any military impor
tance, and the blockade and capture of
Havana means the loss of the "ever
faithful isle." With a navy numerical
ly only half as large as that of the
United States, and this being still fur
ther crippled by the fact that some of
Its best ships are undergoing extensive
repairs, which may keep them out of
active service for many mo-nths, the re
mainder of the fleet of Spain is handi
capped for the want of coaling stations.
Ships leaving any port of Spain will
consume one-half their coal supply,
and coaling at sea from colliers is at
the best very uncertain, and becomes
hazardous when in hostile waters. The
armored cruisers, torp&d</-boat destroy
ers and transports would become of no
value whatever in a very short time,
while our ships would have a picnic
time making excursions to Havana.
The mercantile steam tonnage of the
United States and Spain, from which
auxiliary cruisers and transports could
be drawn, was given in The Call re
cently as taken from Lloyd's of 1896.
Later figures fro-m the same source
supplemented with Navy Department
data increase the number of available,
especially for the United States.
The appended tables give the name,
tonnage, year of build and speed of 126
screw steamers in the merchant serv
ice of the United States, and 39 in that
of Spain, built of iron or steel, and
taking only cognizance of such as have
a continuous sea speed of twelve knots
and over, and of more than 1000 tons'
register.

purposes in time of war, and a list of
those adapted for war purposes was
some time ago made public, giving de

To seven steamers no batteries had
been decided upon at that time. In
October last the Navy Department had
added forty-six more steamers to its
available list, including those newly
built on the Atlantic, and such stanch
ships as the Alameda and Mariposa on
this coast. This makes eighty-four
merchant steamers available for auxil
iary cruisers, a lleet more than twice
as "largo as the entire roster of Spanish
merchant steamers exceeding a speed
of twelve knots. The Pacific Coast re
serve of auxiliary cruisers will not in
all likelihood be needed for there are
enough available craft on the Atlantic
to form a cordon around Havana, and
where such tugs an the Laurada,
Dauntless and Silver Heels, of less than
50 tons burden, have succeeded in run
ning the blockade the hundreds of tugs
and other steamers would not fail to
carry over and land a multitude of
soldiers and all the war material
needed.
GREAT BRITAIN
AND UNCLE SAM
Some Leading Questions
Are Asked in the
Commons.
Michael. Davitt Desires to Know
About Offering Fleets and ;{â ;
an Alliance.
Mr. Curzon Diplomatically Dodges
Questions, and Says a Reply Is
Inexpedient.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. March 14.â 1n the House of
Commons to-day the Parliamentary
Secretary for the Foreign Office, Mr.
Curzon, replying to Michael Davitt, antl-
Parnelllte, who ; asked the Government
whether Great Britain had offered to
lend men-of-war to the United States
in the event of a conflict between the
United States and a European power,
said that the Government had not made
such an offer.
Answering a series of questions which
Mr. Davitt â¢ put with a view of
eliciting whether there have been any
negotiations for an alliance between
Great Britain and the United States or
whether Great Britain had offered to
mediate in the Cuban crisis, Mr. Curzon
said these questions were of such a na
ture that it was Inexpedient to reply to
them.
Mr. Curzon's reply that Mr. Davltt's
questions .were inopportune was re
ceived with loud cries of "Hear, hear!"
from the Unionist benches.
Mr. Davitt in an interview on the
subject said: "I put the question as
to the ships because the subject was
not proceeded with last week. I want
ed to elicit the truth. I knew, of
course, that the statement made to the
effect that warships would possibly be
loaned was as absurd as the rumored
alliance, and I received exactly the an
swer I expected. Mr. Curzon is too
clever a diplomat to give any answer
which would dispel the idea that an
American alliance is on the tapis, as, of
course, it ever was. Mr. Curzon
knows it, but it serves England's pur
pose to let the Continental nations
think it is possible in the near future."
TWO NATIONS THAT
SYMPATHIZE WITH SPAIN.
Austria and Germany Are Friendly
With the Castilians and Would
Aid Them.
LONDON, March 15.â The Vienna
correspondent of the Standard declares
that Austria and Germany sympathize
with Spain, the former being actuated
by family ties between the two reigning
houses, and the latter by a grudge
against the United States. The corre
spondent adds: "The Chinese question
is much more practical for the United
States than the Cuban, but America
has no naval base in Chinese waters.
Why should not Spain make peace by
offering the United States a naval sta
tion in the Philippines? Spain would
lose nothirg thereby. On the contrary
the Philippines would be more assured
to her than before, and the Americans
would be enabled to act from that base
in conjunction with England and
Japan."
SAW THE MAINE
AS SHE WENT DOWN
Arthur Bachman an Eye-Wit
ness of the Fatal
Disaster.
Heard the Explosion and Ran to the
â Wharf Overlooking tho
Harbor.
Arthur Bachman, the manager of the
firm of Bachman & Ehrmann, arrived in
the city Sunday afternoon from Cuba,
and tells the story of the sinking- of the
Maine from the standpoint of an eye wit
ness. On the 15th of February, the night
cf the fatal disaster, Mr. Bachman was
standing in front of a hotel in the city of
Havana, with a number of friends, when
he was startled by a terrific explosion,
which shook the city and echoed and re
echoed from the direction of -.lorro Cas
tle.
"I was standing across the road from
the Hotel Inglatera."' he said, "with two
American friends and a number of Span
lards. As far as I can recollect it was
about 9:46 when we heard a terrific explo
sion and a low and horrifying rumbling
noise which immediately followed.
"At first we thought it was another out
break of the Insurgents, and we started
down the street In an opposite direction.
We hadn't gone far, however, when a
passing Englishman informed uÂ» that the
battleship Maine was on fire in the har

where hundreds of people had already as
"The city of Havana, by this time, was
in a state of excitement and uproar.
Some thought the city was on fire, and
alarms- were sounded from all sections;
some thought the insurgents were form
ing on the outskirts of the city; and half
the people in their excitement didn't
know what to think and, seized with ter
ror rushed frantically in all directions.
"At last the truth about the explosion
spread, and people began to flock to the
wharves to get a glimpse of the sinking
"When I arrived." said Bachman, "the
forward part of the vessel or bow was
hidden from view, and the stern, as much
of it as was dlt-ernible, was entirely in
the flames. Lightb were shooting heaven
ward like so amny rockets, and the sky
was one blaze of light.
"Those who witnessed that awful spec
tacle will carry recollections of it to their
dying day. The distant groans of dying
men, the calls of help from the wounded
and the drowning, the dispatch boats ply
ing from the doomed ship with their
erewsome freight to the Havana shore,
are sights that will forever bring before
the recollection a picture of horror.
"The Spaniards who were on the wharf
that night and were living witnesses to
the sinking of the battleship had no other
expression but that of the slncerest sor
row for the ill-fated sailors, and the
doomed vessel, and did all in their power
to alleviate the sufferings of the
wounded."
RUSSIAN SAILORS
LANDED AT CHEMULPO.
Proceeding With a Quantity of Stores
to the Capital of
Korea.
YOKOHAMA, March 14.â The Japanese
Parliamentary elections are proceeding

ernment will have a majority.
A Russian volunteer steamer has ar
rived at Chemulpo from Port Arthur and

THIS CITY
NOW WELL
PROTECTED
Some San Franciscans
Have Feared Spanish
Warships.
Assurances Given by Officers
That Great Seacoast Guns
and Monitors Can Defend
the Harbor.
Call Office, Riggs House.
Washington, March 14.
It Is understood that several petitions
from San Francisco have reached the
Secretary of the Navy asking that the
Oregon be kept there. .It seems that
some of the San Franciscans are fear
ful that the Golden Gate city will not
be sufficiently protected against the at
tacks of Spanish men-of-war. But they
need have no fear on this score, for ord
nance officers of the War Department
declare that the great seacoast guns
and the monitors Monterey and Monad
nock would be entirely sufficient to de
fend the harbor. Furthermore it is the
present intention of the Navy Depart
ment to keep the Charleston and Phila
delphia at San Francisco. Orders have
been sent to rush work on the Charles
ton and have her ready for commission
by the first week in April. The Phila
delphia is expected to be ready for serv
ice a few days after that.
California members of Congress with
whom The Call correspondent talked
to-night have various opinions to offer
as to the best mode of defense of San
Francisco against possible attack.
They do not apprehend that there will
be any fighting on the Pacific Coast,
but are confident that San Francisco
would be in no danger in any event.
Senator Perkins believes that the geo
graphical situation of the city renders
it practically safe from the attack of
hostile war vessels. As a member of
the Naval Affairs Committee he feels
that he should not give a too free ex
pression of opinion on matters which
he may be later called upon to consider
in his official capacity, so when he was
asked for his views to-night on the
safety of San Francisco in case of war
he said: "San Francisco would be well
protected by our coast batteries and
the monitors without the assistance of
the Charleston and Philadelphia."
Congressman Hilborn, as heretofore
stated, is a firm believer in the monitor
type of battleship. H He , believes in
coast defense vessels ? rather, than cruis
ers â â  Congressman Loud says that the
inland situation of San Francisco ren
ders the city practically safe from
shells. "A hostile ship," he continued,
"must stand out to sea beyond the bar
and could not get closer than four miles
to our coast line. Therefore the Suan
iards must shoot seven or eight miles.
It seems to me that the work o( our
coast defense guns would be effective
at four miles' range. I do not believe a
hostile war. vessel could Inflict much
damage by shelling San Francisco. The
city of Charleston was bombarded at
much closer range than would be possi
ble at San Francisco, yet Charleston
did not suffer, much from the shells. 1
am a firm believer; in the efficiency of
the big coast defense guns. It seems
to me however, that all of this specu
lation Is idle. Our San Francisco peo
ple are in no danger , whatever I do
not believe there will be war with Spain
and if there is the city and harbor of
San Francisco will be amply protect
ed." _^

Tests Made at the Watertown Arsen
al Before the Modern Piece of
Ordnance Is Shipped.
BOSTON, March 14.â A 12-inch dis
appearing gun carriage â  stands in the
setting-up shop at the Watertown Ar
senal and to-day a 12-inch breech
loading gun was mounted upon its
huge arms. To-morrow the carriage
will be tested by means of block ana
tackle, and if it works perfectly will be
dismantled and boxed for shipment to
California. While there is much war
talk in the air, the shipping or this
modern piece of ordnance to the Pacific
Coast does not seem to .corroborate
statements that war is at hand. _ _
In the course of another month it is
expected that another 12-inch carriage
will be completed. It is to be sent to
Washington. To-day a large number of
men worked on the 12-inch carriage, in
the carpeter shop and boxing stores.
The gun is thirty-five feet long. It Is
made on the tube, sleeve and jacket
principle. It throws a projectile twelve

SENATOR MASON
CHALLENGED TO FIGHT.
Refuses to Consider Seriously the In
vitation of a Spanish Editor to
Battle With Swords.
WASHINGTON". March 14.â Senator
Mason received to-day the challenge
sent him by the editor of the Spanish
Illustrated paper, El Cardo.
The document is printed and is
signed by the editor, the Marquis de
Alta Villa. The challenge is to a com
bat at swords' points and is preceded
by a short column of personal abuse, in
which Mr. Mason is described as "an
ignoble Yankee Senator, who scold*
like a woman and who has not the
vaior to fight like a man, and who
would take a slap in the face without
repenting it." The Amercan people arÂ«
referred to as a "people who deal in
j'ig-s and whose flag is the almighty
dollar."
The Senator accepts the challenge in
a jocose spirit. He says he will have
to see the Marquis before he decide*
whether he will accept, but that It
scarcely accords with Spanish modesty
for the challenging party to name thÂ«
weapons, as is done in this Instance.
LANDSMEN ENLISTED
AT LEAGUE ISLAND.
Orders Beceived to Recruit as Rapid*
ly as Possible Men for Seamen
and Coal Passers.
PHILADELPHIA, March 14.âTo
day for the first time "landsmen" were
enlisted for service in the United States
navy at the League Island Navy
yard. Any able-bodied man who an
swered the physical requirements was
admitted. The reason for this action,
one of the officers of the shipyard said
to-day, was that orders have been re
ceived from Washington to recruit as
rapidly as possible 200 landsmen to
serve as seamen and coal passers.
DETAILS OF MARINES
FOR THE CRUISERS.
Two of the Drafts Are for the Pbila-
delphia and Charleston, Now
at Mare Island.
WASHINGTON', March 14.â Colonel
Hay wood, the commandant of the Ma
rine Corps, to-day made five details of
marines for cruisers now being re
paired or ready for commission. There
are two grafts of fori --five each for the
Philadelphia and the Charleston at
Mare Island, one of fifty-two for the
Newark at Norfolk and two of
thirty each for the Columbia and Min
neapolis at League Island.
HUNTINGTON'S BIG DRY
DOCK AT NEWPORT NEWS.
Work Will Be Commenced To-Day on
the Mammoth Concern That
Is Needed by the Navy.
NEW YORK, March 14.â A Rich
mond (Va.) special to the Herald says:
Work will commence to-morrow on the
mammoth drydock which Collis P.
Huntington announced recently he
would build at Newport News at a cost
of $1,000,000. It will be the largest
basin in the world, 750 feet long, 160
feet wide and 30 feet over the sill. It
will hold two first-class battle-ships at
one time.

DELAYED BY
THE ILLNESS
OF A JUROR
Clark Murder Trial
Goes Over for a
Day.
New Complications May
Result From One
Man's Sickness.
If He Does Not Soon Recover
the Case Must Be Re
opened.
HOPES OF THE DEFENSE.
Will Seek to Save the Prisoner by
Blaming the Widow of His
Victim.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAP A, March 13.â The trial of George
W. Clark, the St. Helena murderer, was
called in Judge Ham's court this morn
ing, but one of the jurors, D. F. Hamp
ton, declared he had so severe an attack
of the grip it would be impossible for
him to weigh any evidence, no matter
of what character.
â vVhen the jury was called Hampton
arose and said he was too 111 to pro
ceed and he wanted the court to ad
journ long enough for him to get well.
There was no objection from the de
fense and Dr. E. Z. Hennessy added his
word to that of the juror. Judge Ham
adjourned court until to-morrow
morning.
One day's adjournment was a little
less than Hampton wanted; in fact
there are many who believe Hampton
would wish to remain ill until another
juror had been sworn in his place, but
the Judge would allow but twenty-four
hours.
The plan of defense Is still in the
dark. There have been symptoms of
a defense on the ground of insanity,
but most of the indications point to the
excuse which is as old as Adam â the
woman did it.
Not that the defense will try to prove
that LoVina Clark killed her husband,
but there will be an attempt to prove
that hers was the master mind that
influenced the murderous hand, if in
deed it did not actually direct it.
"The woman did it" will, in some
form, be the defense, but it will also
include a theory that the murderer was
mentally weak; that he was a moral
pervert; that he was anything or ev
erything that will save his neck â for
to save his neck, so say all except the
attorneys for the defense, is the only
thing that can be hoped for in his be
half.
District Attorney Bell, who has had
charge of the case from the time of the
murder, has twenty-six witnesses
â whose evidence will cover every pos
sible theory the defense can advance.
Among his witnesses, too, are several
who are relied on to give the best evi
dence for the defense, a kind of legal
backfiring.
The defense so far has subpenaed
five witnesses â Dr. Osbourn, J. H.
Stevens, W. H. < Uitwater, Rev. James
Mitchell, M. E. McDonald and Robert
Pratt Jr. For all of these the accused
has worked, and their testimony may
be made to show lii.s steady character,
his capacity for work, his inu'llifrer><â
or his insanity, just as the exigencies
of the case, when the prosecuuoij
elopes, demand.
Henry Hugan, chief counsel for the i
defense, declines so far to outline his
case. The habitues of the courthouse j
say he is waiting for developments of i
the prosecution, but Hogan keeps his â 
mind to himself. So far he has con- j
tented himself with objecting at every j
opportunity, but he hints at develop
ments of his own. His questions to the j
jurors the first day were general; on 1
the second day he inquired about their |
views regarding insanity; then he j
dropped that line, and where he is
now no one but himself knows, and he I
keeps his own counsel.
The loss of Hampton as a Juror, j
should his illness prove so serious as i
to cause such a complication, will make
a tangle of the case. The jury having
been sworn and accepted, there can j
be no further attempt to select a juror !
without reopening the case, and if that j
is done a shower of peremptory chal- I
lenges may be the result, for the orig- |
inal number, twenty, will be restored
to the defense. They will not be di
rected against the jurors already
sworn, however, for the defense de
clares it is satisfied with those impan
eled.
The big fight of the case will be over
Clark's confession. The defense will
try to keep it out on the ground that
it was made under promises affecting i
the punishment of the murderer, which
is oxplicitly declared by law to render
such a confession of no value as evi
dence. The prosecution, however,
hopes to get it in.
If it be admitted, Clark's chances are
dim and distant.
DIES FROM EXPOSURE.
Inmate of Marin's Poor Farm a Vic
tim of Intoxication.
SAN RAFAEL, March 14.â Boys on their
way to school discovered the lifeless
body of old James McDermott to-day. It
was lying on the edge of the creek with
one hand in the water, while by the side of
the corpse lay a half-filled flask of whis
ky. The old man liau been a drunkard
for years, and last night he went on his
last spree. For sixteen years he had been
an inmate of the County Poor Farm. His
brother lives in San Rafael, where he has
property interests.
McDermott left the Poor Farm yester
day. The matrun during the night dis
covered his absence and a search was
made for him without success. The sup
position is that the old man staggered
over the embankment into the creek some
time last night and died from exposure.

Sensational Episode of the
Jeremiah Blake Divorce
Case.
Wife of the Plaintiff Determined to
Retain Possession of Her
Child.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, March 14.â A decided
i sensation developed to-day in the di
| vt.-rce case brought by Jeremiah Bur-
I ton Blake against Mary Alice Blake, on
i the ground of desertion. Mrs. Blake
! has flown with their child and the pre-
I sumption is that she is by this time out
of the State of California and the juris
diction of the Superior Court of Marin
County. .â .,.
For years there has been a fight be
tween "husband and wife for the pos
session of their child. They lived at
! Marshalls, a town in Marin County.
i Only one child had blessed their union,
j a little girl with a sweet face and a
â  sunny disposition. Both father and
I mother loved the little one, although
their married life was anything but
happy. In August, 1896, Mrs. Blake re
ceived a telegram from her mother,
who lived in Tacoma, stating that she
was dangerously ill, so the daughter
packed her trunk and, taking the child
with her, went to Tacoma.
After she had been away about a
month her husband wrote to her, ask
ing her to come home and she replied
that she would not return. Blake went
to Tacoma to obtain possession of the
child. He found his wife extremely ill
from an operation. He returned with
out the child, as the mother was in such
a delicate condition that the excitement
of losing the little one might have killed
her. While in Tacoma Blake received a
telegram from his mother in Marin
County, as follows:
"Do what you went for."
He admitted that it meant the ob
taining of the child.
Blake returned to California and in
November, 1896, made a second trip to
Tacoma. He saw his wife and child
and asked to be allowed to take his
offspring out for a walk. This was
granted him and he took the little one
down town, where he purchased some
toys for her. At 6 o'clock he returned
the child to the mother. On the 4ay
following, the father called to take the
i little one out again and for a second
j time the privilege was granted him.
He never returned with the girl.
In December last Mrs. Blake came
down from Tacoma to compromise the
! divorce case which her husband had
brought, but was unsuccessful. The
I case came to trial on Friday. The fa
j ther proved a strong case. While
Judge Angellotti was about to render
j his decision the mother gained poss*-s
| sion of the child and held her. The
Judge paused and said he would de
cide the case on Monday (to-day) and
requested all the principals and attor
! neys to be in court at 2 o'clock. ThÂ«
mother still held the child and would
not let her go. Blake ran up to take
the infant away. Deputy Sheriff Bob
Cottlngham stepped between, and, tak
| ing the child's hat from the father,
placed it on the infant's head and al
lowed the mother to go away with the
child. All parties understood that Mrs.
I Blake would produce the child in court
to-day, but when the hour arrived
I Blake and the attorneys were on hand,
i but the mother- and child failed to put
jin an appearance. Mrs. Blake is on her
I way to Tacoma, having left with the
I child last Saturday.

ed. About two years ago Wade was con
victod of- having wronged Lelpha Scott,
and was fined $3000, with the alternative
of spending 750 days in jail. An appeal
was taken, and pending its decision Wade
was released on $3000 bonds. Just before
the Supreme Court decided the case Wade
disappeared.
Subsequently it was found that Wade's
bond had been stolen from the County
Clerk's office. A duplicate copy of ' the
bond was substituted, and the matter was
up before Judge Lorigan to-day on an or
der for the bondsmen to produce Wade in
court or pay the $3000 bond. Wade's
mother and John Maloney arc the bonds
men. They were represented by Attorney
H. C. Moore, who said that if given time
Wade could be produced in court. They
said Wade was out of the State, but could
be produced in twenty days.
This statement caused some surprise, as
it was thought "\Vade was in a foreign
land and would never return. April 5 was
set as the time for Wade's appearance in
court.

DEATH CLOSES
A BUSY CAREER
Capitalist Charles McFad

Salinas.
Settled in Monterey County in
1884 and Acquired a
Fortune.

the Masses.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, March 14.â A1l Salinas is
mourning the death of one of her most
venerable citizens, Charles McFadden.
who lived in this community for thirty
five years.
Charles McFadden was born in Dub
lin in 1821. He and two brothers came
to America when very young and em
barked in mercantile business in Phila
delphia. After some years they sold out
and came to California in the fall of
1854, going direct to Calaveras and en
gaging in mining. In 1863 Mr. McFad
den came to this county and settled
near . Blanco, about seven miles from
this city. He was engaged in raising
livestock, on this Blanco ranch, and
also was proprietor of a large lumber
and milling business in this county.
His farming interests were lncreÂ»seÂ«l,
and through many other cartful busi
ness ventures Mr. Mci^adclen acquired
considerable wealth. He was known
all over this section of the State, and
had business interests in almost every
town in the country.
Mr. McFadden was a devout Catholic,
and contributed to all charitable un
dertakings. He married in this State,
and his widow, three sons and three
daughters survive him. The funeral
will take place from the family resi
dence on Wednesday afternoon, the in
terment to be made at Castrovllle.
HE USED LOADED DICE.

ing dice a few days ago, and Corey and
Jones caught Davis in the act of using
loaded dice. They then took from Davis
$80 that he had won from them. Davis
went to Los Gatos and procured a war

LONDON, March 14.â A report which
may have a very important effect on
the present European situation was cir
culated in political and party circles
last night.
For some time the best informed peo
ple in official circles have privately dis
cussed the possibility of Lord Salis
bury's resignation of the post -of for
eign secretary, but any statement to
that effect has been persistently denied
by those in authority.
There is no longer any use denying
that Lord Salisbury's health is such as
to make it absolutely impossible that
he can give the application and study
necessary to determining the vital de
tails of the Foreign Office administra
tion. Lord Salisbury will leave within
a few days for a sojourn abroad and
during his absence Mr. Balfour will be
reigning chief at the Foreign Office.
The talk lasU evening was that this is
not a temporary but a permanent ar
rangement. It is also stated that Lord
Salisbury at his advanced age finds it
quite sufficient to be at the head of the
Government. It is possible that this
view of the situation will be categori
cally denied, but I fancy that in a very
short time my calculations will be
shown to be absolutely accurate.
FOR GOVERNOR OF
THE SOLDIERS' HOME.
The Probabilities Are That Colonel !
Eonesell of Los Angeles Will Be
Chosen for the Place.
WASHINGTON, March 14.â The prob
abilities are that Colonel Bonesell of Los
Angeles will be made manager of the Sol
diers' Home at Los Angeles to succeed
Captain Barrett. Senator Perkins and
Representatives Hilborn and Barham
have recommended Colonel Bonesell.
The "governors" or "managers" of the
several National Soldiers' Homes are
elected every six years by the Military
Affairs Committee of the House of Rep
resentatives. The next election occurs on
April 21. It is understood the chairman
of the committee, Hull of lowa, is in
clined to favor Colonel Smedberg of San
Francisco, and inasmuch as Congressman
Loud did not join his colleagues of the
California delegation in the recommend
ation of Bonesell it is barely possible that
Smedberg may be elected.
CROP OUTLOOK
NOT HOPEFUL
Rain Badly Needed in
the San Joaquin
Valley.
Frost Does Much Damage in
Several Sections of the
State.
Irrigation Scheme Projected by
Owners of Land on Rob"
crts Island.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, March 14.â Captain J.
"W. Smith, a leading grain-dealer on
the water front and the local buyer for
George TV. McNear, said to-day in ref
erence to the crop outlook for San
Joaquin Valley:
"We are passing through a crisip, the
seriousness of which can hardly be ap
preciated by the people at large. Un
less there is a copious rainfall within
the next seventy-two hours, followed
by a cessation of these winds, we may
put the crop in this valley down as a
failure. I have serious doubts whether
or not the rain now would save the
grain on the lands where alkali or
adobe Is mixed, as the moisture Is too
far gone. We have faced only one
such crisis in ten years, and the fact
that we were. saved at the last minute
is the ray of hope in the present
gloomy outlook. The uncertainty of the
present is a terrible tension on those
who have their all staked In the grow
ing of grain."
Great interest centers in the move
ment in hay. It closed locally at 518
a ton (retail) on Saturday, and opened
to-day strong at $20. It is predicted that
it will go higher, as several dealers
seemed to hold contracts covering a
larger part of the wheat hay for the
year. As high as $16 is being paid at
wholesale, and alfalfa can hardly be
secured at any price.
Woods Bros., on Robers Island,
among the heaviest grain-growers in
the West, intend to make the best of
the situation this year and try to raise
a crop. Irrigation of grain crops on
the island is comparatively untried.
The Chinese gardeners often siphon
the water over the levees for the irri
gation of garden truck, but practical
attempts to water large tracts of grow
ing grain on the reclaimed lands have
not been made. This is what the Woods
Bros, expect to accomplish. They own
the greater part of Roberts Island, and
the outlook for a drought is exceed
ingly discouraging.
To-day the Messrs. Woods were fig
uring on commencing the work. They
propose to irrigate a tract of over 2000
acres on the lower division of the isl
and and contemplate the cutting of the
levee for that purpose. They must
first, however, obtain the consent of the
reclamation district, as the work is
dangerous unless properly handled and
might flood thousands of acres.
The plan is to put in a sluice about
twenty feet wide through the big levee
at a distance of about four feet below
the lowest water. This will give a
stream all the time and at high tide
will pour a big volume of water
through the sluice. Then ditches and
dams for Xhe distribution of the water
will be made to cover the area of the
2000 acres. This firm raised $100,000
worth of wheat here last year, and 'the
prospect of losing an amount equal this
year compels it to ' resort to heroic
measures.
FRESNO, March 14.â There was an
unusually heavy frost in this county
last night and early this morning, and
reports have been recived here of great
damage to the fruit crops. W. T. Daw
son, foreman for W. W. Phillips, the
large fruit-grower, telegraphed that
Phillips' crop was practically destroyÂ«d.
The Phillips ranch is on the San Joa
quin Kiver, about twelve miles from
here. The trees blossomed early this
year because the soil was warm, owing
to lack of irrigation; hence, the early
frost is damaging. The frult3 that
suffered most were peaches and apri
cots, the latter being totally destroyed
in many sections.
C. E. Barnett of Fowler reports
nearly the entire peach and apricot
crop on his place killed by last night's
heavy frost.
From Reedley the report cornea that
the greater part of the fruit crop was
greatly injured.
The temperature in this city last
night was 34 Fahrenheit, while at Reed
ley the mercury was down to 26. Ice
formed in many places. In the Imme
diate vicinity of Fresno the damage
was not so great as in other parts of
the county.

FIGHTING FOR
TWO ESTATES
Sensational Litigation in
the San Joaquin
Courts.
Mrs. Cook Sues for a Portion
of the Estate of L. U.
Shippee.
Putative Heirs of the Late George M.
Kasson Seek to Acquire His
Riches.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, March 13.â The atten
tion of the Superior Court of San
Joaquin County will be occupied
during the coming week by two
cases of more than local interest. One
Is the suit of Mrs. Cook against W.
A. Shippee, as the administrator of the
estate" of the late L. U. Shippee, at one
time one of the best known capitalists
on the coast. The deceased left the
remnants of his once magnificent for
tune in the form of a trust deed to his
nephew, the administrator, to be sold
and the proceeds distributed among a
few relatives and intimate friends.
Among the latter was Mrs. Cook, a
friend who nursed him through his long
months of illness and was well favored
by him before his fortune and health
declined.
Mrs. Cook sues the administrator for
an accounting and contends that he has
not endeavored to carry out the wishes
of the deceased in reference to the
$5000 bequest to her. By reason of the
prominence of the litigants the testi
mony in the case will be carefully
watched, and it is anticipated that
there will be sensational disclosures
concerning the life of the late bachelor
capitalist.
The contest In the estate of George
I M. Kasson, whose property is worth
$150,000, will be a bitter one. A dozen
well-known law firms are engaged. Kas
son lived and died in this county as a
man without a family, and his will,
duly probated, made no mention of
issue. Now comes George W. Lindy, a
fisherman, who claims to be a natural
son, the issue of a marriage entered
into by Kas<son in St. Louis in the late
I forties. His mother died and he was
I adopted by a man named Lindy. He
j claims to be the sole heir. Against his
j claim is that of Mary Mann of Nebras
ka, who sets up a similar claim to the
fortune, but her trump card has not
been disclosed in any opening state
ment by her counsel. A feature of the
case is that a partial distribution has
already been made under the probated
will, involving certain liabilities which
must be settled by other suits. The
case will attract widespread interest, as
the old rancher was a "high roller" and
distinguished himself only for devia
tions from the paths of sobriety and
moral rectitude.

FELLS HIS FOE
WITH A CLUB
Capitalist Metcalf of Losi
Angeles Tenants a
Cell.
Arrested for a Vicious Attach
Upon Fred Day of
Omaha.
Quarreled. Over Business Affairs, and
the Injured Man Is Near to
Death.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 14.â 1n the
very heart of the business center of the
city, at Third and Spring streets, Fred
Day, a capitalist of Council Bluffs,
lowa, was clubbed into insensibility
by Henry Metcalf, a well-known and
wealthy resident of this city.
Day was proceeding down the street
with J. W. Conger when Metcalf
stepped up from behind. Not one word
was spoken by either man. Shoving
Day apart from Conger, Metcalf struck
I him three blows over the head with a
heavj* orange wood cane. Day fell to
the sidewalk unconscious. Blood flowed
from his wounds, which were at once
recognized as serious. He was carried
to the police station in an ambulance,
and up to a late hour was still uncon
i scious and almost pulseless.
Metcalf made no attempt to escape.
He was placed under arrest, and coolly
stood by and saw the victim of his
vicious blows taken away. HÂ« was
then conveyed to the police station and
; locked up.
The assault was the result of a busi
[ ness disagreement. Day came to Los
; Angeles to settle up the estate of his
: deceased brother, who had been a part
; ncr of Metcalf, who has heretofore been
; a quiet and respected citizen and the A
I last one from whom a murderous as-
sault would be looked for. In their
I business deals the deceased Day came
into possession of a number of notes of
j Metcalf's. In settling up the estate of
' his brother, Fred, Day held Metcalf's
! notes and the two men had some
trouble over them. The difficulty over
i the collection of these notes led to the
'. assault this afternoon.
The cane with which Metcalf did the
clubbing is of stout orange wood. It is
â¢ fully an inch in diameter and it made
â a most formidable weapon. The doctor
announced late this evening that if Day
! recovered it would be a miracle.

FORCED TO DISGORGE
Consumers Will No Longer Sub=
mit to the Extortion in the
Way of " Deposits."
An Insight Into the Cost of Manufacture of
Gas Which the Companies Have Kept
a Profound Secret.
The thousands of householders who |
have been held up by the gas company |
and forced to pay tribute to its unlaw
ful "deposit fund " are either preparing
to make the com] any disgorge or have j
already done bo. The suit begun by
Henry James last week to recover the
$5 "deposit" he had been obliged to put
up before the company would supply j
him with pas. and the alacrity with
which the company offered to refund
I the money as soon as the matter be- j
1 came public through the medium of
r The Call, has set the other victims to
I thinking, and already there have been
numerous demands for the return of j
the deposits, whie.'x have readily been
complied with.
This action of the company can only
be construed as an admission that the
gas officials have full knowledge that
-their demands were illlegal, and rather
than have a court of law pass upon
It are ready to refund the money to all
who demand it. hoping that some
would not take the trouble to draw
down their deposit and that after a
time, when the present agitation had
subsided, in 'the absence of a definite
ruling on the subject, they could re
sume their old "bluff" game on the
public.
But their hopes seem likely to be j
vain, for the people are fully aroused
over the Imposition that has been prac
ticed upon them for years, and it is
probable that within a few weeks this
â  ormous fund, which has helped to
Bwell the dividends on gas stock by
thousands of dollars annually, will I
â  c found its way back into its right
ful owners' pockets, and the companies
v.i'il have to be content with their le
gitimate profits, which ought to fully |
satisfy the most avaricious security
holder.
Another thing which has aroused the
Ire of consumers against the gas com
panies is the statement of James E.
Burling, published in The Call last
Saturday, showing the enormous profits
in gas.
Mr. Burling was for several years
Be i etary of the old Central Gas Com
nd Is thoroughly familiar with
all the details of the business. Not
g ago Mr. Burling, together with
other local capitalists, considered the j
feasibility of starting nn opposition j
int in this city, but decided to let the
matter rest in abeyance for the pres
ent. Mr. Burling, however, made a
thorough investigation into the cost of
the manufacture of gas and reported to
his tes that it could be delivered
at a cost not exceeding forty cents per
â usand feet. He was convinced that
with the methods of manufacturing gas
i 'w in use by the established com
lies it dltl not cost over fifty cents
per thousand. i
The publication of this statement has
given people an insight into the im- I
niense profits of gas when it is taken |
into consideration that it is sold for j
fl 75 per thousand. That Mr. Burling's j
estimate is approximately correct Is
pubijiantiated by Thomas Price, who
y yen the subject much study, and ]
jrs that water gas can be manufac
tured for twenty-five cents per thou
sand, and the addition of a sufficient
quantity of shale or petroleum gas to j
give it the required illuminating power
a (ids but a trifle to that sum.

Bale of tickets indicates plainly that the
affair will, be a success and shows that
enthusiasm in the good old day is not
lacking.
The cost of manufacture has always
been a carefully guarded secret of the
gas companies, not only in this but in
the Eastern cities as well. Colonel C.
L. Taylor, the gas and water inspector,
has unsuccessfully sought to obtain in
formation on this point from almost
every city in the United States, and
once, when during the course of a con
versation Joseph B. Crockett, presi
dent of the San Francisco Gas Light
Company, promised to give Colonel
Taylor all the information in his power,
and the latter asked the costof manufac
ture, Crockett smiled and said: "Oh, of
course you can't expect me to say any
thing about that." In his official re
port for the year ending June 30, 1897.
Colonel Taylor gives some interesting
figures as the result of his investigation
into the cost of gas in Eastern cities.
In New York the cost of gas to public
and private consumers is fixed by law
at $1 25 per thousand of twenty-candle
power. In the ten largest cities of Mas
sachusetts the cost of gas for street
lamps averages $1 per thousand. The
price in other cities is as follows: Cin
cinnati, 51; Cleveland, 80 cents; Buffalo,
$1; Milwaukee, 51; Indianapolis, $1 25;
St. Paul, 51 40; Allegheny, $1; Albany,
51 70; Syracuse, $1 30. Regarding the
quality of gas supplied by the San
Francisco companies, Colonel Taylor
has no complaint to make. The gas is
tested by him several times each week,
although the law requires that it be
tested but once a week, and he has
never yet found it to fall below elgh
teen-candle power. The thing that he
regrets most is his utter inability to
obtain information from the heads of
the companies as to the cost of manu
facture.
Thomas Price, the well-known chem
ist and assayer, has probably given the
subject of gas as much study as any
body in San Francisco. He uses gas
not only for lighting, but for heating
and power purposes as well, and is a
recognized authority on the subject.
Mr. Price explained the process of the
manufacture of illuminating gas to a
i 'all reporter at considerable length.
He said that the cheapest gas is what
is termed water gas, which, although
giving: intense heat, is of little value as
an illuminant. But when mixed with
certain kinds of coal gas, or with gas
derived from petroleum, the necessary
illuminating power could easily be ob
tained. That, he said, was the way gas
was manufactured by the local com
panies. The water gas did not cost to
exceed 25 cents per thousand feet, and
to give the required illuminating power
they used shale, which was obtained
from Australia. Crude petroleum was
also used, and for that purpose a con
siderable quantity of the product of
the Los Angeles wells found a ready
market. Either shale or petroleum gas,
"Mr. Price said, gave an illuminating
power of above forty candles, while
only eighteen candle.-power was re
quired by law, so that a comparatively
small proportion mixed with the water
gas sufficed for the ordinary gaa of
commerce.
Mr. Price could not give the cost of
manufacture of either shale or petro
leum gas, but was of the opinion that
Mr. Burling's estimate of the cost of
ordinary gas was not far out of the
way.
If it is possible for the people to get
at the exact cost of pas, they are in a
mood now to compel the companies to
not only refund the compulsory de
posits, but to reduce their rates to a
fair price.
TORN BY A
WILD BEAST
A Trainer at the Chutes Has
a Narrow Escape From
Death.
Ho Was Exercising a Leopard When
It Suddenly Turned on
Him.
A i rench trainer who Is connected with
the Zoo now at the Chutes had a narrow
escape from a horrible death yesterday
morning.
He was putting a leopard through a
series of tricks, when suddenly the ani
mal became enraged and turned on him.
With a savage howl, it buried its teeth in
his left arm, tearing out a piece of flesh
before it could be subdued.
The injured man way taken to a near-by
drugstore, where the wound was cauter
ized by Dr. Quigley. He suffered terribly
under the operation and almost fainted
twice. He was taken back to the Chutes,
where he now lies, faint from pain and
loss of biood. and it is probable that his
arm lias been rendered useless for life.
DEATH OF A PIONEER.
Dr. Berryman Bryant Succumbs After
a Long Life of Usefulness.
Dr. Berryman Bryant, a native of Spar
tnnburg, S. C, aged 81 years 5 months,
died at the residence of his son, Calhoun
Bryant at 2916 Clay street, last evening.
The doctor has been a resident of this
State since June, 1849, and in former
years was a prominent member of the
Society of California Pioneers, and was
a prominent Mason. He practiced medi
cine over fifty years, and since 1549 in
California, and was probably the pioneer
living physician on the coast.
In early days he practiced in Marys
ville, and erected a large hospital in Sac
ramento. Later he practiced in Gilroy
and San Jose. He has 1 een largely in
terested in farming, stock raising and
manufacturing and is well-known all
over the State.
He was a Presbyterian and has been
an elder in that church for over forty
years. He has been repeatedly urged to
outer politics, but has always declined,
preferring private life. One of his last.
wishes was that he be burled among his"
old friends in Gilroy.
His funeral will take place on "Wednes
day, Mnrch 16. at Gilroy, pn the arrival
of the S:ls train from this city.

THE SA^T FRAXCISCO CALL., TUESDAY, MARCH 15, 1898.
TOOK HER
PURSE AND
VALUABLES
Arrest of Frank Hall
for Robbing a Cat
tle King's Wife.
She Met Him in a Resort
and Became Infatuated
With Him.
Induced to Visit His Room She
Is Promptly Relieved of
Her Property.
EVIDENCE OF HIS' GUILT.
Sad Experience of MrS* Alverson,
Who Lately Arrived From
Montana.
Frank Hall, alias Hartman, who
claims to be a remittance man, was
arrested yesterday morning by Officer
Brophy and locked up in the tanks
pending an investigation. He is ac
cused of stealing 5295 in gold, a check
for 5500, a gold watch and chain and a
diamond brooch from a woman named
Mrs. Alverson, who claims to be the
wife of a Montana cattle king.
According to her story, she met Hall
in a resort at Eddy and Mason streets,
and, at his invitation, she accompanied
him to a room on Post street. During
the night, she claims, he took hermoney
and jewelry and disappeared.
She at once notified the police with
the result that her alleged despoiler
was taken in custody. When searched
at the City Prison all the stolen prop
erty was found in the possession of
Hall. After learning of Hall's arrest
Mrs. Alverson refused to prosecute
him.
"I would jump into the bay first,"
she remarked; "my husband would kill
me if he h->ard of my disgrace."
BOUND FOR DUTCH HARBOR.
After many delays the ship Slntram finally got away for the north In tow of the tug Fearless yesterday. She
has four stern wheel steamers and six barges aboard that are to be put together when the vessel reaches Dutch Har
bor. They are for the Alaska Exploration Company and are for use on the Yukon River.
Hall or Hartman tells an entirely
different story. He says that he and
a friend were enjoying the perform
ance at the Olympic Theater when
Mrs. Alverson who was seated at a
table, sent him a card which bore the
name of May Wright.
"I want to see you," she wrote; par
don my familiarity."
Hall at once joined her, and they had
several rounds of drinks at her ex
pense. After leaving the theater Mrs.
Alverson, he claims, gave him her
purse, diamond brooch and gold
watch.
"I know they are safe with you,
dear," he says she remarked as she
handed him her valuables; "take care
of them until I eet sober."
On reaching the room, the prisoner
says, Mr 3. Alverson sent him out for a
bottle of brandy. Going to a saloon
near by he met a friend, who asked him
to accompany him to the Cafe Royal.
A short time afterward Policeman
Brophy appeared and placed him under
arrest. As the woman positively re
fuses to prosecute Hall the police in
tend to release him to-day.
Some time ago Hall was suspected of
stealing $10 from a guest at the Bald
win. As the latter would not swear to
a complaint against him he Avas given
his liberty.
Cook's Case Continued.
The Police Commissioners met last
night and dismissed the charge of unoffl
cerlikc conduct preferred against Officer
Aitken. He was accused of assaulting J.
Moreland while the latter was attending
the late Mining Fair. The evidence
.showed that the policeman merely
"shoved" Moreland in order to make a
space for some chairs. Owing to the ab
sence of Attorney Kugene Bert the case
of Patrolman .James Cook, charged with
ill treating James Bond, a clerk In a
south of Market lodging house, was con
tinued for one week.
. . __ â  m â  â â â . : ;
Arrested for Contempt of Court.
As Frank Lee Gift left Judge Camp
bell's court, where he had been on trial
for battery yesterday morning, he was
served with a warrant charging him with
contempt of court, and was taken to the
County Jail. Two years ago Gift was
divorced from his wife, and Judge Slack
awarded the woman $30 per month ali
mony. This was paid until last May
when on account of illness Gift was com
pelled to give up his position with the
railroad company. He left town soon af
terwards and returned only a few weeks
ago. The charge of battery was placed
against him by his wife and her attor
ney, F. A. Smithson. Gift says he is
guilty of battery against Smithson, but
not against his wife. He will probably
contest the contempt case and attempt
to prove that his wife has been guilty
of misconduct, though he says he is
averse to riphtinp the mother of his son.
OYAMA KENICHI.
Desperate Effort to Prevent Extradi
tion of the Little Brown Man
Accused of Forgery.
Attorney Thomas D. Riordan is making
a desperate attempt to prevent the extra
dition of Oyama Kenichi, the Japanese
who was arrested on his arrival here on
a charge of having secured 15.000 yen, or
$7500, in Japan by means of a forged pa
per. About half that sum' was found on
the person of the Jap when he was taken
into custody by the United States Mar
shal, and this sum was seized by the au
thorities as evidence and as the suspected
proceeds of the allowed crime.
L. H. Webb appeared for the Japanese
Government, and was backed up by the
presence of Mr. Segawa, secretary to the
Japanese Consulate In this city, before
United States Commissioner Heacock
yesterday morning. The papers put in
evidence on behalf of the Japanese Gov
ernment were objected to by Mr. Riordan
on every p.ossil>l<- ground of informality,
irrelevancy end immateriality. The trans
lation of the papers, some being in
Japanese and others In French, was con-*
tended to be Inaccurate, and Mr. Segawa
was required on the cross-examirtation
to give an offhand translation of one of
them, in which he did very poorly, owing
to his meager knowledge of English. The
examination will be resumed at half-past
10 o'clock this morning.
Left the Board of Unemployed.
San Francisco, March 14, 1898.
Kindly take notice that the under

i of the Unemployed Men and Women of
i San Francisco, now engaged in securing
subscriptions for a free labor bureau,
\ have decided to discontinue our connec
j tion with the work of the board, and
i have therefore resigned from said raem
berahtp. The moneys so far contributed

THE SINTRAM
SAILS AT LAST
After Many Delays She
Finally Gets Away for
Dutch Harbor.
Harbor Commissioner Rudolph
Herold Takes His Seat
on the Board.
Colonel Chedbourns Retire* Into
Private Life After Four Years
of Service.
The tug Fearless, with the ship Slntram
in tow, finally got away for Dutch Har
bor yesterday afternoon. All the Sin
tram's passengers congregated on the
deckhouses aft and waved a frantic good
by to their friends on the various
wharves. They greeted the passengers
on the ferry steamer Newark with three
cheers and the captain of the ferryboat
answered them with three toots of the
whistle. Every steamer along the front
blew a farewell whistle to the Fearless as
she passed along, and Captain Clem Ran
dall was kept busy answering their sig
nals. It will be a long tow to Dutch Har
bor and no one will be better pleased
than the crew of the Fearless when it is
over.
The steamer Humboidt got away for
Dyea and Skaguay yesterday with every
passenger she is allowed by law to carry
aboard and a full cargo. During the ex
citement of leave taking one of the pas
sengers lost his balance and fell over
bourd. His sweetheart, who was on the
wharf, promptly fainted, and when she
came -to her senses her lover had been
fished out of the bay and the Humboidt
was backing away from the wharf.
The schooner Sadie has made a record
run from Umpqua to San Diego. She
covered the distance in 3 days 14 hours,
and made the round trip in 17 days.
Alexander Roseborough, who has been
wharlinger at Washington and Clay
street wharves for a couple of years, re
signed his position yesterday and his
brother, J. J. Koseborough, was appoint
ed in his stead. Alec is going to the
Klondike in search of a fortune.
W. Eaton, the owner of the yacht Frol
ic, was one of the sufferers by the recent
storm. His gasoline launch, which was
tied up at Sausalito, went adrift during
the norther and the supposition is that
she turned over and sank, as she has not
been seen since.
The Harbor Commissioners met yester
day afternoon and Kudolph Herold Jr.
took the seat vacated by Colonel F. S.
Chadbourne, the retiring Commissioner.
Colonel Chadbourne retires with the es
teem and goodwill of everybody connect
ed with the shipping interests of San
Francisco. To him is due the credit of
East street being the model thoroughfare
of the city, and to him are due many of
the improvements that have been made
in the plans of the new ferry depot. From
the commission Colonel Chadbourne goes
to the Alaska-Yukon Transportation
Company as director and controller, and
he will also be general manager of the
San Francisco Transfer Company. Hia
first-class business training will stand
these companies in good stead when he
takes hold of the reins.
Mr. Herold's friends made the board
room gay with flowers in honor of his ap
pointment. A beautiful anchor made of
red carnations around which was woven
a coil of manila rope was placed on his
desk, and in other parts of the room
there were wreaths and bouquets galore.
Mr. Herold promises to be a very popular
Commissioner.
MORE SCHOOLS DEMANDED.
West of Castro Improvement Club
Enters Its Protest Against the
Board.
Richmond district is evidently not the
only section of the city that has a griev
ance against the management', or rather
thâ¬- mismanagement, of the Board of Ed
ucation in so far as that body has made
provisions for the outside growing sec
tions of the city's population. West of
Castro, a comparatively newly settled
section of the city, has increased in resi
dents to that extent that at the present
time the members of the Improvement
Club claim there are 400 children of school
ago deprived of an education because
there are n<j school buildings in which
they can be accommodated.
The Lick School building, which Is lo
cated on Twenty-fifth and Noe streets, is
so overcrowded that it became necessary
for the Board of EMucation to rent two
old stores as primary departments of the
school.
One of these was found to be so unfit
for the use for which it was rented that
it had to be abandoned. There was no
flooring in the old rookery, and the chil
dren's feet werg* made to rest on the
cold, wet earth. Colds and sickness fol
lowed this condition of affairs, and the
present board hired another store farther
away from the center of the settled dis
trict, where the children, or such of them
as can be packed into the building, are
provided for. At Twenty-fourth and Cas
tro streets is another store rented for the
smaller children. Neither of these places
is suitable for the use for which they
are occupied, as they are draughty and
cold, with no proper ventilation.
The club, at its last meeting, discussed
the condition of affairs in this respect,
but it was deemed best to take no posi
tive action at present, as any complaints
made received no attention from the
members of the board.
A strong petition will, however, be pre
sented to the Supervisors before the next
tax levy is made for a sufficient appro
priation with which schoolhouses may be
built for the accommodation of the chil
dren in the district next year.
Another cause of grievance debated by
the club members is that of no lights in
the district. They have asked for two
electric lamps in the vicinity of Twenty
third street and Hoff avenue. The ex
pense of running the wires into this sec
tion is a mere trifle as the company has
poles to within a few hundred feet of the
place.
After sundown this section is as dark
as the most distant part of the north
pole in the month of January. But this
would be overlooked as comnared with
the disadvantage of having the children
deprived of an education by reason of no
proper buildings.
HARD PUNCHING
AMATEUR BOXERS
Three Entertainments This
Week to Decide Cham-
pionships.
The Kxcelsior, Jefferson and Western
Clubs Will Introduce Their

The popular Excelsior Athletic Club will
give another first-class athletic entertain
ment this evening on Folsom' street, near
Eighth. The programme of events has
already been published in The Call. Suf
ficient to say that the members can count
upon a good evening's sport.
The Jefferson Athletic Club will give a
boxing entertainment on Friday evening
in Mowry's Hall, Grove and Laguna
streets. The event of the evening will con
sist of an eight-round bout for a trophy
between Charles Conway of the Jeffer
sons and James Reilly of the Excelsior
Athletic Club.
The officers of the Jefferson Club are:
President. J. -. Siivey; vice-president, W.
F. Burke; financial secretary J. H.

Magnus; sergeant-at-arms, J. McCor
maok; directorsâ T. Riordan, H. B. Hil
ton, A. Eisner, J. F. Brennan. T. C. W.i
son and IL J. Mulcrevy. Apart from the
boxing events, the club will also afford
the members an opportunity of witness
ing some clever wrestling bouts.
M. Haley of Washington, D. C. writes
The Call that he will deposit $1000 at any
time and place as a forfeit to back P.
Reidy of Washington against any
white pugilist in America weighing 158
pounds at the ringside, for a limited con
test or a finish fight, McCoy or Dan
Creedon preferred, the contest to take
place in San Francisco before any of the
popular clubs. Ji Haley is sincere in his
proposition to back his choice to the tune
of $1000 he must mean business. Possibly
the Olympic Club will give Reilly a
match with Mexican Pete.
Griffo, the erratic Australian pugilist,
left tins city last Sunday for Red Bluff,
where he will meet Young Peter
on the 26th inst. in a twelve-round con
test. Douglas tone of Red Bluff, it is
said, will wager $1000 on Jackson whip
ping the clever Australian.
Dick Williams' Trial.

INTERPRETATION
WAS AT FAULT
Judge Low's Idea of Law
and Order Receives
Criticism.
Attorneys Agree That Children Should
Receive the Protection of
the Courts.
Judge Low's interpretation of the law
in regard to the admission of minor chil
dren into saloons and the fine imposed
upon a saloon-keeper who had been con
victed of allowing children to visit his
saloon has aroused considerable comment,
and without an exception the legal fra
ternity who have been questioned on the
matter agree that the Judge is very
much in error in Kie matter.
Peter Bokoriska had been convicted of
allowing minor children to visit his re
sort on Mission street and was lined the
small sum of $5. TÂ».e fact that the pro
prietor of the rather questionable resort
has been in court on many previous occa
sions and that the Police Commissioners
agreed to cancel his license when he again
appeared for its renewal did not seem 10
bother the interpreter of the law, and the
prisoner at the bar was allowed to escape
with a fine of $v.
There is a State law which covers both
the sale of liquors to minor children and
the prohibition of their visiting saloons
and public resorts, as well as places open
to public view, and again a municipal or
der has been passed which prohibits the
children from visaing all public places
where any game of chance is in progress.
The State law imposes a line of from $100
to *000, whereas the municipal law allow*
the Judge to even more severe, and a
fine for the conviction of such an offens*
may be a fine from the minimum limit
placed by the btate law to $UHw in the dis
cretion of the Judge before whom the
case may be tried.
All attorneys agree that although the
fine is increase above the State law in
the municipal order, it is not in order that
the fine wnich may be imposed upon a
convicted individual shall ua placed at a
lower figure than that nxed upon by tho
State statute.
It has been clearly shown by many
well-known attorneys and members of the
bench that the Ju~ge either misinter
preted the meaning of the law or was not
conversant with it. The reading of the
two statutes is plain to all, and it is
thought to be a remarkable decision
which has allowed a man convicted of
allowing a minor to visit his place of
business and then after conviction to es
cape the clutches of justice by depositing
in the city treasury a mere pittance.
The ordinances follow:
The State law, which was approved March 11.
1831, states under section 1 that every person
who sells or gives or causes to be delivered to
any minor child, male or female, under the
age of 18 years, any intoxicating drink In any
quantity whatsoever, or who, as proprietor or
manager of any saloon or public house where
Intoxicating liquors are sold, permits any such
minor child under the age of IS years to visit
such saloon or public house where Intoxicating
ii'iuors are sold, for the purpose of gambling,
playing cards, billiards, pool, or any game of
chance shall be deemed guilty of a misde
meanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof, be
punished by a fine of not less than $100 nor
more than $300, and in default of payment of
said fine shall be imprisoned in the County
Jail for a period of not less than 100 days.
Order Board of Supervisors. Xo. i 624, section
Iâ lt shall be unlawful within the city and
county of San Francisco for any proprietor,
keeper, bartender, clerk or any other person
having the charge or control of any saloon,
barroom, billiard-room or poolroom, or of any
other public place or place open to public view,
to permit any person under the age of IS
years to play or engage in or be present at
any game of billiards, pool or cards, and it
shall likewise be unlawful Tor any person un
der the age of 18 years to play or engage in
or be present at any game of billiards, pool or
of cards in any public place or place open to
public view within the city and county of San
Francisco.
Penalty: Section 2â Any person who shall
violate any cf the provisions of this order
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and
upon conviction thereof shall be punished by
a fine of not more than $1000 or by Imprison
ment in the County Jail for not more than six
months, or by both.
POST BOADS.
An Important Point Raised by the
Sunset Telegraph and Tele
phone Company.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
granted a preliminary injunction yester
day against the Trustees of the town of
Vallejo, restraining them from prevent
ing the erection of telephone and tele
graph wires and poles in that city by the
Sunset Telegraph and Telephone Com
pany.
The contention of the Sunset Company
is that it is doing the work, not under
any franchise granted by the town of
Vallejo, but under a contract with the
Postmaster-General and authorized by
Congress for the erection of postal tele
graph lines for postal and military pur
poses, and that the streets of Vallejo are
open post roads of the United States.
The point raised is a novel one. and its
decision will materially affect the rights
and privileges of telegraph and telephone
companies all over the United States.

THE EFFICACY OF "RIOTS."
AT the First Presbyterian Church of Oakland on
Sunday the Rev. Robert F. Coyle made a point
in connection with the late "demonstration"
over fixing water rates in that city which merits more
than a passing glance. The learned doctor consid
ered the attempt of the people to make it warm for
the Councilmen who sold them to the water combine
as exceedingly reprehensible, and he declared that
the very persons who became riotously indignant
over the passage of the water order were responsible
for electing the Council. In other words, he con
sidered it a case of the people placing a lot of bood
lers in office and then grumbling because they were
corrupt.
Perhaps the view taken of the affair by Dr. Coyle
cannot be controverted. He seems to have analyzed
the situation exactly. The people of Oakland did
elect the boodlers, and it is in evidence that they
rioted when they found they had been sold to the
water combine. But, in our opinion, the learned
gentleman in fixing responsibility upon the people of
Oakland did not descend to first principles. If the
people are not to riot in cases like this what are they
to do? Nobody knew the boodlers before election
or understood their game. They all represented
themselves to be honest men, and each and every
one promised, if elected, to do his duty. The people
of Oakland undoubtedly voted for them upon the
strength of these representations.
The "riotous conduct" which Dr. Coyle so serious
ly reprehends, therefore, proceeded from anger, not
from a desire to escape responsibility. Having been
deceived, the people of Oakland adopted a boisterous
method of manifesting themselves. What else could
they do? Should they sit down quietly and say,
"Dear, dear, dear, how dreadful! Next time we will
elect honest men." How are the people to know
honest men when they see them? Take "Stringless"
Woodward for example. He has been protesting his
honesty ever since the "wah," and there was a gene
ral belief that he would be ahovc temptation. Yet
no sooner is he appointed Councilman than he goes
over, body, bag and breeches, to the water combine.
What would Dr. Coyle have the people do with
pompous old frauds like this Grand Army pretender?
Send them to a reformatory?
Of course, riots are always bad. Their effect on
communities is destructive of social order and sub
versive of la-A\ But they are the only things, except
over-ripe eggs, which make any impression upon
legislative boodlers. If Councilmen, Supervisors
and legislators who sell their constituents to corpora
tions could be rotten-egged or mobbed every time
they are caught at the work, in time, perhaps, they
might be educated up to the danger of deceiving the
people. Eggs are to be preferred to riots, but we are
not disposed to quarrel with the people of Oakland
over the methods they adopted of manifesting their
dislike in the cases of these Councilmen. They might
have considered eggs too mild for "Stringless"
Woodward and his pals.
Of course the man who shot a friend for attempt
ing to play footpad was promptly acquitted. A citi
zen who shoots a footpad hardly does the community
a greater service than the citizen who removes the
sort of jolfer who conceives that to pretend to be a
Jootpad is funny.
Robert G. Ingersoll says that had the Maine be
longed to England, France, Germany or Russia,
Morro Castle would have been reduced by bombard
ment before now, which, being true, argues that this
is not particularly a jingo nation.
The theory of hypnotism, sometimes gibed at by
the practical, would seem to embody the only plea
the Harbor Commissioners can advance for the
manner in which they have allowed contractors to
make puppets of them.
It would please the people of this country to have
the battle-ship lowa sent to Havana. There is no
probability that the Spanish would blow it up, and it
might awe them to a condition of politeness.
When two policemen engage in a public brawl
which lands them both in jail, the supposition that
at least one of them should have his star taken away
would seem to have a substantial basis.
Probably it is an error to say that Spain believes
in the theory of an inside explosion. She is merely
asserting that she believes it, which is quite a differ
ent matter.
If Spain ever shall undertake to drive the United
States from the seas a proper spirit of reciprocity
would drive Spain off the earth.
A word of explanation as to why a Chilean ship
ever happened to be named "O'Higgins" would not
be devoid of interest.
The Cuban with an impulse to play traitor would
make a poor insurance risk.
WAR AND ANNEXATION.
HE annexationists have pretended to take heart
and "hope out of the prospect of a war with
Spain. In such event they say our possession
of the islands for military purposes is of first import
ance. But why? If we take them we must defend
them. The self-examination into our defensive con
ditions which has been forced by the Maine incident
and its consequences has found us lacking in ade
quate defense of what we have already. We lack
ships, guns, powder and trained men. To get them
means a large expenditure. The $50,000,000 appro
priated by Congress is to the extent of $20,000,000 in
expenditure already, and the whole sum will not even
put us on a proper peace footing, to say nothing of a
preparation for war.
As we have often pointed out, we are supported
by both Captain Mahan and General Schofield in
saying that to provide a naval squadron and land
fortifications to defend Hawaii against the weakest
of the sea powers will cost as much as all the rest
of our national defenses.
England's weakness now is in her distant colonies.
That same weakness is what is destroying Spain. The
latter power could defend herself against a European
coalition for less than her expenditures in the appar
ently futile effort to retain Cuba and the Philippines.
Peace is the normal condition of this country; war
is the abnormal. Our continental position and pos
sessions are invulnerable, when we are ordinarily
prudent. Hawaii brings to us weakness and not
strength. In every diplomatic crisis the islands will
be our sore and undefended toe, stuck out to be
tramped on. They inevitably involve us in those
foreign complications which it is our highest policy
to avoid. Our right interest in them is wholly in
their independence and neutrality.
The talk of war with Spain all arises in the demand
among us that Cuba be given autonomy, and what
infuriating logic it is to insist that to compel Spain
to give the Cubans autonomy we must take it away
from the Hawaiians. If the same argument were
made about Mexico, for instance, how absurd w r ould
it appear and how lacking in justification!
Again, the appearance of dissensions in the present
Government of Hawaii is given as a fresh reason
why the treaty should be ratified. We have had in>
ternal dissensions in this country. How would we
have looked upon a joint declaration by the rest oi
the world that they gave the nations the right to
interfere in our affairs, destroy our autonomy and
cut us up between them, like a carcass hacked for
hounds.
In brief, the prospect of war with c pain or any
other power is an added reason why we should insist
that Hawaii is to be the neutral and independent
Switzerland of the seas. Let her people and their
leaders adjust to themselves a Government suited to
their moral and physical conditions, to the peculiar
needs of their leading industries and their labor sys
tem. They will then never know the affliction of
external war, and may develop on such lines as are
projected from their individual genius and their
capacity to maintain civil institutions.
AMERICAN EXPOSITIONS.
ACCORDING to the latest reports from Omaha
thirty-five States have now organized and
taken steps to provide exhibits at the exposi
tion to be opened this summer. Several of these
exhibits are to be aided by liberal appropriations
made by the State Legislatures. This is notably the
case with respect to the exhibits of States which be
long to the same section of the Union as Nebraska.
The people of those commonwealths recognize that
the exposition is in its nature an interstate affair,
which will attract attention to the whole of that re
gion of the Missouri Valley, and are resolved to
have their portion of it presented as fav> rably as any
other.
The fact that thirty-five States are to be repre
sented at the exposition by organized State effort is
an evidence of the value which the Eastern people
have learned to place upon such exhibits. Although
nearly every year sees an interstate exposition held
in some part of the East, the people, so far from
tiring of them, seem to grow more and more inter
ested. This can be due to but one fact. Experience
must have proved that such undertakings are bene
ficial to all who take part in them. On no other
hypothesis can we account for the large displays
made in Atlanta so soon after Chicago; then at Nash
ville and now at Omaha.
What has been found beneficial in the East cannot
prove otherwise in the West. If expositions arc so
profitable that two of them can be held in the same
section of the Union in such swift succession as that
which brought the fair at Nashville to follow the one
at Atlanta, it is fair to assume that an exposition of
the Golden West to follow the one at Omaha would
prove as profitable as any of them, and possibly by
reason of the greater novelty of the exhibits more
profitable.
The one danger to be guarded against is that of
delay in beginning preparations. The only ambitious
undertaking in the way of an exposition on this
coast was that of the Midwinter Fair, and in that en
terprise everything had to be done in haste. A nota
ble success was accomplished under the circum
stances, but nothing like what would have been
achieved if two years of time had been allowed the
managers in arranging the scope of the fair and the
exhibitors in preparing to make a display of their
goods.
A prompt start gives advantage in many ways. We
should have our enterprise so far advanced as to be
able to make such a showing of money subscribed
by the time Congress assembles next winter that we
can obtain an appropriation for assistance in the
work. San Francisco at any rate should set to work
early. When the interstate convention invited by
Governor Budd assembles the delegates from this
city will be expected to take the lead. If they do not
those of some other city will, and San Francisco will
have lost the exposition.
SPANISH PRIVOTEERS.
IT is reported from Madrid that Spanish officials
are of the opinion that in case of war the United
States would suffer more than Spain. Their argu
ment is that the war would be conducted mainly by
privateering, and, as the United States has more
ships to lose than Spain, the chances of war would
be against us. That this view is widely held among
the Spaniards cannot be doubted, since it is only a
short time ago Senor Mendez de Vigo, Spanish
Embassador at Berlin, made the significant state
ment that as Spain did not sign the treaty of Paris
in 1856 she therefore has a right without violating
treaty obligations to strike a terrible blow at Ameri
can commerce.
A war of privateering, however, would not be so
wholly one-sided as the Spanish officials seem to
think We might and probably would lose some of
out ships and suffer a considerable loss in the busi
ness done by our commercial marine in case of war,
but the loss would be but a gadfly sting to the nation
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 15, 1898.
as a whole. Moreover, due account would be kept
r.f every American ship destroyed, of every dollar of
excessive insurance imposed on our commerce by
reason of danger of Spanish privateers, and at the
closing of the war Spain would have to pay the bill.
It ii not likely, moreover, that the loss which pri
vateers could inflict upon us would be great. The
puimy days of privateering are over. No neutral
nation would harbor a privateer or furnish it with
munitions of war. It would have to find its base of
supplies in some Spanish port, and our navy would
soon make the entrance to those ports very danger
oui to any privateer that might venture to try it.
It hardly needed these warning utterances from
Spanish officials to put us on guard against priva
teers if war should come. That method of warfare
was to be expected of the Spaniards. It is charac
teristic of the nation to fight in that manner. Even
in the war for national defense against Napoleon
they left him in possession of the field, the cities and
the open country, and maintained their contest
wholly by guerrilla bands hiding in the fastnesses of
the mountains and venturing forth only when they
had an opportunity to cut off a French force that
had rashly moved away from the main army.
Guerrillas on land are' naturally privateers by sea.
If we fight Spain we must fight on those lines. There
will be no big battles either by land or sea, unless we
can get the Spanish in a corner some way. We must
therefore prepare to meet an assault of privateers
upon our merchantmen rather than of warships
against warships, and fortunately we will be able to
do this without a greater loss than Spain can be made
to pay after the war is over.
McKINLEY'S FIRST YEAR.
NO President since the time of Lincoln entered
office under more adverse circumstances than
McKinley. The campaign which preceded his
election was one of more than ordinary bitterness,
and threatened to engender antagonisms which would
outlast the term of his Presidency. The business of
the country, which had been bad for Tour years, was
still stagnant. The revenues were deficient, and a
drain of gold from the treasury was imminent. His
political opponents had belittled him as "Mark
Hanna's man," had denounced him as the "agent of
trusts" and had shown every evidence of an intention
to harass his administration and assail his personal
character incessantly so long aj he remained in office.
He has just completed the first year of his term and
already he has won the confidence of the whole peo
ple as completely as he had won that of his party be
fore he was nominated. Although his party had con
trol of but one house of Congress, the Senate having
a free silver majority and being opposed to his finan
cial policy, he has succeeded in bringing about the
enactment of a tariff which has restored industry, re
vived trade and provided the treasury once more
with an income equal to the needs of the country.
He has harmonized factions, removed all causes of
dissension in the ranks of his own party, and has even
succeeded in inducing the generally obstructive
Democratic and Populist minority in the House to
act with discretion. His appointments to office have
given satisfaction to the people. His speeches and
his messages to Congress have had the effect of al
laying apprehensions and encouraging the business
interests of the country to enter with confidence upon
new enterprises, and, in short, all the acts of his offi
cial life have been of * nature tn silence demagogues,
put an end to agitations and restore the republic to
its normal condition of har: ;ony and well-ordered
prosperity.
The President is now reaping the reward of his
statesmanship, his tact and his patriotism. He enjoys
the fullest confidence of Congress and the country.
His political opponents tfiave ceased to vilify him.
The mugwumps have censed to sneer at him. No
one now disputes his pre-eminence in the administra
tion or denies that he is better fitted for his high
office than any man who has occupied it for a long
time.
Whatever may come in the future, It will not be
denied that the first year of McKinley's term has
been one of brilliant administrative success. He has
demonstrated his ability to conduct with wisdom the
complex affairs of home politics, and is now trusted
implicitly in the management of every detail of the
crisis with Spain. This is a notable victory to have
been won in a single year under such circumstances.
The people have reason to be gratified that they have
such a President at this juncture. It is a potent factor
on our side in the controversy with Spain since it
unites the people for action as they could never have
been united under the Presidency of a less tactful
and resourceful man.
A man named Freeman came to town with a little
money, out of which he was promptly bunkoed. He
went to the rescue of the confidence operator, who
rewarded him by bunkoing him a second time. Mr.
Freeman does not seem to be one of the ordinary
suckers who are born every minute. He was evi
dently born twice a minute.
Congressman Smith, who is now engaged in sub
jugating the Spanish at space rates, portrays the va
liant manner in which, armed only with an umbrella
and a consciousness of patriotism, he put five Cas
tilian soldiers to flight. The incident ought to be a
lesson. Let the army be equipped with umbrellas.
There comes from Cuba no rumor of threat to ex
pel the Senators and Congressmen parading down
there as correspondents, and yet their impertinence
ought to be rebuked in some way.
The German artillery has been remodeled and the
French have nearly equipped themselves with new
guns. The German change cost $50,000,000. Their
gun is three inches and the French three and flve
elghths. The rFench is a quick-firing breech-loader
and shoots ten shots a minute. Two of these guns
are equal to a battery of six of the kind with which
our army is now armed. The rapid fire necessitates
two ammunition wagons with each gun and greatly
increases both the cost of the gun and the difficulty
of keeping it supplied in the field. The new French
guns cost $10,000 a gun, with 1000 rounds a gun. The
sooner our ordnance department begins on a quick
firing gun the better. The change antiquates our
artillery and leaves it where the armament of half
our fleet is to-dayâ hopelessly o-ut of date.âPhiladel
phia Press.
When the managers of the Louisville and Nash
ville Railroad cut the wages of trainmen and switch
men in 1893 they promised to restore them when the
earnings were equal to those of 1892. That period
has arrived, and the wages will be restored, yet
there are those like Mr. Bryan who insist that busi
ness has not perceptibly improved since he was nom
inated in 1896.â Indianapolis Journal.

MODERN ARTILLERY.
PROOF OF PROSPERITY.
HOW BUSINESS GROWS.
THE PROBLEM OF IRRIGATION IN CALIFORNIA
California seems now to be standing at !
the portals of an unusually dry season. I
The situation forces consideration of the
need for Irrigation development over
large areas of the State. Great as is this
need, we are conf routed with the fact
that unless a general public Interest in
the solution of the great problem is
aroused no solution will be found and no
progress made.
Irrigation development by private capi
tal has practically reached its limit.
There are very few localities where new
L propositions can be found warranting its
Investment. The only solution of the
problem is through State and national ac
tion. California is big enough to bring
about either or both if her people could
be aroused to their importance, and to a
; full realization of the fact that the irriga
tion district system is a delusion and a
disastrous and hopeless failure, and that
its continuance merely makes certain the
stagnation of Irrigation development.
Enough water never can be had for the
irrigation of the Sacramento and San Joa
quin valleys except through the construc
tion of storage reservoirs in the Sierra Ne
vada Mountains. Yet San Francisco must
look to the settlement of these great val
leys for her future growth, and it be
hooves her to give attention to their de
velopment.
If Congress would act upon the recom
mendations of Captain Hiram M. Chit
tenden of the United States Corps of En
gineers, in his recent report submitted as
the result of his labors and investigations
under the Congressional appropriation
made for the location and survey of res
ervoir sites in Colorado and Wyoming, a
policy would be adopted by the Federal
Government which would bring about the
construction of the storage reservoirs in
the Sierra Nevada Mountains necessary
to furnish enough water for the irriga
tion of the great interior valleys of this
State.
Beyond and separate from the project
of Federal storage reservdlrS' solely to
conserve flood waters is the movement
looking to the reclamation of the arid
public lands through the construction by
the Federal Government itself of the ir
rigation works necessary for their recla
mation. The Irrigation Congress has de
clared in favor of this, Governor Myron
H. McCord of Arizona strongly urges it
in his last annual report, and the move
ment is fast gaining strength. California
has an enormous interest in it. There are
millions of acres of arid public lands in
this State which never can and never will
be reclaimed in any other way. The arid
public domain in San Diego, Riverside,
an Bernardino and Los Angeles counties
is a vast empire in itself, a desolate des
ert now, but capable if irrigated of sus
taining a teeming population.
California should lead in an active or
ganization and agitation to push the
adoption of this policy by the Federal
Government. Every paper in the State
every political partyâ every California
Senator and Congressman â every cham
ber of commerce or organization of any
kind having for its purpose the promotion
of general prosperity, should be vigorous
ly and actively advocating the adoption
of this broad policy by the Federal Gov
ernment.
No general public Interest has been as
yet awakened in reference to these pro
jects for Federal reservoirs and irrigation
works, which are of such far-reaching
importance to me State of California. A
start has been made, however, by the re
cent organization at San Diego of an as
sociation called "The Irrigation Propa
ganda," having for its object the awaken
ing of public interest in this great and vi
tal subject, and branches of this organi
zation will soon be lormed In other places.
They should be organized in every town
and city in California and include every
one who actively desires to promote X its
progress and permanent prosperity.
If for no other reason, such an organi
zation should be formed to fight the gii
gantic steal now incubating for ceding
unconditionally to the States all that re
mains of the arid public domainâ
ing the whole 100,000,000 acres of lands sus
ceptible of reclamation by Irrigation. To
cede these lands unconditionally to the
States would result In their passing in a
few years, through the corruption of
State Legislatures, into the hands of
speculators and range owners, and the
hope of prosperity for the ' whole "West
which now lies in their reclamation by
the Federal Government and their sale in
small subdivisions to actual settlers and
home builders would be gone for genera
tionsâperhaps forever, for once dedicated
to the cowboy and the cattle ranee in pri
vate ownership, their reclamation and
settlement would probably never be ac
complished.
The Phoenix irrigation congress de
clared for a principle as to State cession
whlcn the whole American people should
unite to uphold: " --.
"Resolved. That we favor the cession of
the public lands of the nation to the re
spective States or Territories only upon
conditions so strict that they will insure
the settlement of such lands by actual
settlers in small tracts and absolutely
prevent their monopoly in large bodies
under private ownership." Â£
To cede them absolutely would be a
crime against the people of the nation.
But while public attention is diverted by
the possibility of a foreign war the pro
moters of this monstrous robbery of the
people, hidden under the guise of State
cession, are active, the House Committee
on Public Lands has just reported favor
ably the Shafroth bill, and the steal may
go through in this Congress if the people
do not wake up and prevent it.
In addition to Federal storage reser
voirs and irrigation works, we must have
some plan devised to take the place of
the irrigation district system and to re
lieve the conditions of disaster that exist
wherever there is such a district, and put
California in line for an onward move
ment in the development of her mineral
resources which will follow the subdi
vision and settlement of her arid lands,
which is Impossible without irrigation.
There can be no doubt that a State Ir
rigation system could be devised which
would do "away with all the defects of
the present district system, and under
which the disasters in the districts could
be relieved. The way to get such a State
system devised is for every one inter
est Â«1 in the problem to get to work at
Its solution. "In multitude of counsel
there is safety." A remedy can be found
under a State system for every defect
of the district system, and every objec
tion to such a State system can be ob
viated. But all possible objections should
be foreseen and guarded against in ad
vance Why then can not all who are
interested in this great subject discuss
Its solution through the press and see
whether a State system cannot be devised I
which can be substituted for the district
system, and bring about an adjustment of
conflicting interests which will end all liti
gation, save the lands of all land-owners
from confiscation, save the bondholders i
from loss to the extent that the bonds ,
represent actual value received by the
district, and Inaugurate an era of devel
opment by irrigation In place of the ex
isting conditions of stagnation.
To start thought and draw discussion
thÂ© following brief outline is submitted |
for consideration in a general way. and
as a basis for the suggestion of objec
tions, of a plan for the solution of the
irrigation district problem in California:
(a) The State to issue bonds for the
longest term possible, in an amount suf
ficient to compromise the outstanding in
debtedness of only such districts as have
partially constructed feasible Irrigation
systems, and to thereby acquire and own,
and complete such systems.
(b) The basis of compromise in each of
such districts to be the actual value of
what the district received for the bonds
issued; a limit to be fixed in each district
In the constitutional amendment â  which
would have to be adopted. For Instance,
in the Modesto, Turlock and Kscondido
districts, 75 per cent; in the Tulare and
Central districts, 60 per cent. This
amount to be paid to the bondholders in
cash by the State on its acquiring the
ownership of the system.
(c) The area capable of being irrigated
by each system .to be established by a
competent State engineer, and a State
water right to be issued on the lands tak
en under the system at a rate per acre
sufficient to eventually reimburse the
State for its entire investment, principal
and interest, and give to the land owners
the longest time possible to pay for this
water right which would bring the pay
ments in time to meet the State bonds on
maturity. â  â¢ " ...
(d) Under this system each land owner
could, if he so desired, at any time pay
up in full for his water right, and own
both his land and the right- to the water
necessary for its irrigation .clear of : en
cumbrance. His share of the whole cost
of construction - could be aggregated,
which is impossible under the district
system. , â :; â¢ ' 1
. (c) . The necessary annual ' expenses of
iaLxureaÂ£ULn and malÂ»tananca UHder this.
State system would be met by an annual
rate to be paid by the holders of water
rights just as the shareholders meet such
disbursements in co-operative water com
panies like the Santa Ana Valley Water
Company.
if) No towns to be included under the
reorganized systems, nor any lands
against the will of the owner, but there
is no doubt that under existing systems
more lands would desire inclusion than
the system would irrigate, because the
burdens would be apportioned to the ben
efits, and the State could raise the money
on such long time and Tow interest that
these burdens could be easily borne by the
landowners.
As this proposed State system is con
sidered, objections will be suggested j
which can be overcome in the adjust
ment of the details of the system. The I
proposition has been roughly outlined in J
order to draw forth these objections so :
they can be considered and obviated in j
advance of the preparation of any pro
posed constitutional amendment. Such an j
amendment would have to be submitted j
to the next Legislature, to carry out the
plan proposed.
The district system can never be recon- j
structed or amended so as to operate suc
cessfully. If the present debts should be
scaled down and time for payment ex
tended in those districts where proposi
tions for refunding are now being aerltat
ed.as in Modesto and Tulare. it would only
be a short time before the present condi
tions of discontent and litigation would j
be renewed. The district system is inher- i
ently defective, and these conditions grow j
out of the defects of the system, rather j
than the mere existence of the debt. All
these defects can be eliminated under the
proposed State system. Under the dis
trict system it is impossible to obviate
them. GEORGE" H. MAXWELL.
IF ONLY.
If only to-day were to-morrow.
And yesterday followed to-day.
My sadness would sink into sorrow.
My vanity vanish away;
My spirit would cease from Its roaming.
Nor flutter away like a bird
In the shadowy shade of the gloaming.
The maglca'i moan of a word.
Alas! with the light of the morning
To-morrow has flown to Its rest.
With feverish petulance scorning
The hallowed delights of the blest.
I yearn, with a cynical mocking.
To grapple with Infinite calm,
'Mid aeons of silence unlocking
The tones of a Jubilant psalm.
If only the world were a vision.
If only th* moon were a myth.
If only the star of derision
Would turn from Its kin to its kith.
If only to-rlay werÂ»> to-morrow.
And yesterday followed to-day.
My soul would eternity borrow.
And solemnly vanish away!

the man who drives the Occidental Hotel
hack was standing behind his new vehi
cle, sheltering himself from the rude
blasts that shrieked around the corner,
when he espied a hat rolling past him
covered with dust and in imminent dan
ger of utter destruction from the wheels
of passing bugrgjes and wagons. The hat
was a soft felt one and had the appear
ance of belonging to some fellow of
means who, in his gratitude at its recov
ery, would not let a matter r>f a little
money stand in the way of his duly ex
pressing his sense of obligation to the in
dividual who should recover it for him.
Consequently, the jehu at once left his
place of vantage and started on a wild
chase after the precious bit of headgear.
The pursuit led him several times across
the street and around two or three cor
ners and nearly- involved him in trouble
with several strangers of testy tempera
ments- who, in his headlong course he
bumped into and nearly sent off their feet.
Finally, after considerable trouble, he
succeeded In catching it, and, wheezing
and panting from the unusual exertion,
he turned around to present it to its own
er, whose heavy breathing he had heard
just behind him, as he followed on his
chase. But as soon as he straightened up
and looked into, not the face of the swell
he had expected to see, but into the face
of a very ordinary-looking Chinaman,
who, with outstretched hands stood wait

triumph gave place to a scowl of disgust,

A STUFFED
JURY-BOX
Sensational Discovery
Made by Superior
Judge Hunt.
Names of Talesmen Not
on the Official
List.
"He Reported the Fact, and an
Investigation Is Now
in Progress.
A SCANDAL MAY RESULT.
Ho Explanation as to How the Errors
Came to Exist Can Be
Given.
A little sensation that may be fruit
ful of a large scandal was produced
yesterday when Judge Hunt announced
that he had found that the "big box"
In the County Clerk's office containing
the names of the jurymen who will try
civil and criminal cases during the
present year had either been "stuffed"
or unpardonable clerical errors were re
sponsible for a condition of circum
stances that would cause no end of
trouble. Last Friday Judge Hunt, while
drawing a jury in his court, found that
three names drawn out of the box were
not on his list of jurymen. Each Judge
was given a new list, with the names in
alphabetical order, by Presiding Judge
Belcher a few days ago. Friday, when
twelve talesmen were drawn, the names
of Frederick Lux, George A. Brown and
C. H. Babcock were among them. Judge
Hunt consulted his list and found that
their names were absent. This condi
tion of affairs astonished Judge Hunt,
and he consulted the list of last year
and found that the same conditions ex
isted. He then informed the talesmen
whose names did not appear that they
had best not sit on any jury. Although
he had nothing against them and knew
that all were men o-f unquestionable
reputation, the rules of the court would
not admit of the establishment of such
a precedent.
Judge Hunt then conferred with aH
the Judges of the Superior Court and
Informed them that it looked very much
as though an attempt had been made
to stuff the jury box. Actuated by this
information each Judge has resolved to
compare his list of names with those
of the talesmen in his box. As Judge
Hunt found three names not on the list
in a venire of forty-six, it is thought
that many more will be dug up. Judge
Carroll Cook commenced his investiga
tion yesterday. Several Deputy Cc-unty
Clerks assisted in the checking up of
trtf names, and the work will continue
until the entire list has been gone over.
No explanation as to how the names
have been placed in the "big box" can
be given. Some advance the opinion
that some of the clerks who made out j
the list for the box inserted the names
of friends in order that they might fall j
heir to the remuneration that accompa
nies the position of juryman. This !
theory, however, seems to meet with
but little favor, as the names already
drawn not on the list are those of men !
whose time is of much more value to j
them than a juryman's pay. In any !
event the Judges have determined to
Bift the matter to the bottom and weed
out al! names that do not belong on the
list, and, if possible, determine how
they came there.
BRODERICK TO
MAYOR PHELAN
A Discussion as to the Care
of the Municipal
Funds.
The Auditor Declares He Has Signed
No Bills Which Are
Illegal.
Auditor Broderick made another warm
talk to Mayor Phelan yesterday in a com
munication to the city's chief executive.
He denies that he has either been in
strumental in allowing extravagance in
the municipal departments or that he has
passed any bills that are not legal. The
major portion of Mr. Broderick's letter
was as follows:
"Long: service In office" or "fear of stultifi
cation of previous course" have nothing what
ever to do with my reluctance in "following
the direction" of the Mayor. It is attributable
entirely to a spirit of caution an<3 conservat
ism, due to an education in office, obtained
through experience somewhat seasoned by the
Information obtained through close application
and study and the lessons taught by many
cults instituted by parties desirous of having
me to do that which my Judgment dictated
otherwise. (I have been, aa a general thing
bo far. sustained by the judicial arm of the
government on such occasions.) The Mayor
has been too often in error in his interpreta
tiong of law to have any right to expect me to
take directions In preference to my own Judg-
Continuing, the Auditor refers to cer
tain personal correspondence between
himself and the Mayor, and declares the
Mayor to be in error as to the possibility
of stationery and printing being the same
thinir Stationery Is provided for under
tne ng a C t 8 of a May ry i7. 1&. and Prtntlnris
provided for by an act of March 24 ,1868,
and the Consolidation Act, section 69.
Says Auditor Broderlck:
The demands allowed to me for stationery
are strictâ¢ legal, and It is therefore becoming
off ens"" to me to have contrary assertions
encouraged or made In letters, interviews and
editorial comments, containing at times im-
Srop?r and disgusting illusions to my personal
&s well aa official character.
As to tho extravagance charged against
the County Clerk the Auditor says:
The attention of the Board of Supervisors has
been called to It each year when 1 submitted
estimate expenditures for that office My
opposition and protest has been ""Ifâ¢ 1 "
and steady against that office for a long
time before you were elected to the orme
of Major, and If I mistake not I made
â¢uggestions to you long since now * ol {J
power might lessen it to some extent Â»r
applied. It Is therefore more than annoying
to have It thrown up to me as anew dl8C "l"
cry. In letter*. Interviews and editorial com
ments. A proper public spirit should sugggest
that the existence of such extravagance Is not
chargeable to the Auditor. The failure in i the
Buit of the Superior Court to which you ha\e
referred but lends force to the side I ha\e
taken in the discussion of the subject, ana i*
against your contention. In my letter to you
November 2 I said: "I am disposed to hold
the demands a reasonable time, say ten days
rail the demands of the County Clerk and also
the District Attorney), so that you may recon
sider your premises wherein we differ, and
should no change of opinion prise, then
we may bring about some means of securing
a speedy Judicial determination of the ques
tion at issue." Tou preferred to try the issue
alone; you should therefore hold the Auditor
.blame leaa lor the result.
INFLUENCE
OF THE CHIEF
WHARFINGER
G. W. Root Accused of
Misusing His Offi
cial Position.
He Is Said to Own Stock
in a Transfer Com
pany.
All Kinds of Favors Easily
Procured for His
Friends.
THREATS FILL THE AIR.
He Denies the Charge, but Admits
He Is an Employe of the
Private Concern.
There is a general howl going up
among transfer and delivery men
along the water front over the actions
of Chief Wharfinger Root, and the air
is filled with mingled threats and exe
crations.
About a month ago a new transfer
company known as the San Francisco
Transfer Company sprung into exist
ence. The names of the proprietors of
this concern appear in the County
Clerk's office as George Grunewald, A.
W. Johnson. Lemuel Lucas and James
Gaffeny. The transfer men, however,
claim that Chief Wharfinger George
Root forms a large part of the com
pany In the capacity of a silent part
ner, and that he prostitutes his posi
tion in the most shameful manner to
throw business in the way of his fav
orite company.
Many instances are cited of compa- !
' nies holding the right of way on steam- J
'< ers and steam schooners, and then, i
when the vessel would arrive in port i
and their agents attempt to board, j
they would be confronted with an iron- i
clad statement to the effect that the
San Francisco Transfer Company had
the sole right of way on board that yes- j
: sel. It is also said that a short time j
' previous to the incorporation of the
j new company Root informed the cap- j
tains of various vessels that in a short j
time he would have a favor to ask of j
them, and it has been noticed that the ;
â¢ San Francisco company now has the
right of way on these vessels.
The favors that can be shown a
steamship company by the Chief ,
Wharfinger, without their being notice
able, are innumerable, while he can ]
: also subject them to any number of ;
[ petty annoyances and delays without
the appearance of their having been I
: dcrne intentionally. If it is convenient
( for a ship to lie at a certain pier or in I
'] a certain b^rth. the Chief Wharfinger j
can either assign her to that berth or ;
1 can find a thousand and one reasons j
! to keep her waiting for hours or assign
her to some other berth. It makes lit- '
1 tie or no difference to a captain or '
' owner what company has the privilege
! of soliciting the baggage on his ship, ;
and if he can throw this privilege in the
way of a man who can do him favors j
I in return it seems but natural that he
â  should do so. #
Mr. Root emphatically denied that he
j owned any stock in the company or j
j that he had made undue use of the in- j
i fiuence of his position to procure traffic j
; for it. "All I have to do for the com- j
pany," he said, "is that I hold a po- j
sition as secretary and bookkeeper for j
it at a salary: I own no stock in it, and j
only wish I did. Mr. Johnson is a warm j
friend of mine find I have introduced j
him among friends on the water front, j
who I knew could give him plenty of |
work. What I have done for Mr. John
808 I would do for any other friend. I
The company was organized about a !
month ago, and I was employed as sec- i
j retary at a stated salary. All receipts !
j and bills naturally bear my name, and |
I suppose this has given the impression
that I had an interest in the company.
When I close my office here at 5 o'clock !
my duty to the Harbor Board has
ended, and I believe that I am free to j
go and do as I choose. I then go up j
town, where I have another office, and
look after the books of the transfer
company.
"Of course, as its employe, It is my
| duty to throw any work I can in its
way, and I have also done so whenever |
I could without using my position here |
to back me up in it. If I owned stock
! in the company I would not deny it,
j as there is nothing in law to prevent |
I me from going into the transfer busl- j
j ness if I choose. I am only restrained ;
j from having Interest in shipping, hold
| ing a mortgage on vessels, or acting as
| an agent for a marine insurance, com
pany. If these people wish to complain
about my actions after I am through
here they are at liberty to do so, but
I know that they would not be able to
prove that I have misused my position
here in any way."
TREASURY DECISIONS.
Collector Jackson Notified of Several
Very Important Rulings of the
Department.
The Treasury Department has notified
Collector Jackson that it has made de
cisions to the following effect:
Calfskins are entitled to free entry, but
no dividing line in weight between skins
and hides has been fixea.
Coastwise sea-going steam vessels
under register are exempt from carrying
licensed pilots.
There is no provision of law granting
the exclusive right to owners of patents
of importing patented articles.
Hides of neat cattle imported into the
United States from Europe, if not dry
salted or arsenic cured, require dlslnfo. -
tion; but if imported in transit to Canada
no disinfection will be required. Rags
from Europe imported into the United
States, whether in transit or not, require
disinfection under quarantine regulations
of the Marine Hospital service.

SCANDAL IN
HOFF CASE
INTIMATED
One of Defendant's
Counsel Is Charged
With Misconduct.
Said to Have Offered to
Sell an Alleged Con
fession.
Judge Carroll Cook Has Or
dered an Investigatiorv
to Be Made.
TO PRESENT AFFIDAVITS.
Counsel's Serious Position â Some
One Must Suffer for the
Offense.
The honor of Benjamin W. Melntosh,
of counsel for Albert Hoff, charged with
the murder of Mrs. Mary Clute, Is In
volved in a scandal which has cropped up
since the work of securing a jury to try
the carpetlayer for his life commenced.
It is charged that Melntosh, while em
ployed in maintaining his client's cause
in court, has furthered negotiations to sell
what is alleged to be a confession from
the pen of the accused of the murder
which Is laid at his door, and Judge Cook,
appreciating the graveness of the affair,
yesterday ordered the District Attorney
to make an immediate investigation and
report his findings to the court.
"When Hoff appeared in court yesterday
he was angry, and when Judge Cook en
tered the room he ceased passing his
bony fingers through one another and
looked appeallngly at the court as though
he would have retributive justice meted
out to him who falsely or otherwise stat
ed that he had added to the weight of
evidence against him. Judge Cook took
his seat on the bench, and without cere
mony dismissed the ten jurymen who had
been selected to try the prisoner. He
then announced that it had been called
to his attention by the District Attorney
that one of defendant's counsel had been
publicly charged with grave misconduct,
and ordered the District Attorney to make
an immediate Investigation.
"If the charge be untrue," said Judge
Cook, "action should be taken to punish
the newspaper that published it. If it be
true, other action should be taken. What
ever investigation the District Attorney !
may make must be presented to me in
atndavlts. Upon these affidavits I will
take appropriate action. It is the duty
of the defense to aid the District Attorney
in this investigation."
So ended Judge Cook's remarks, but it
Is evident from their tenor that some one
must suffer, either the newspaper that
published the charge, or the attorney
charged by the newspaper.
W. H. Schooler, leading counsel for the
defense, replied to the remarks of the
court, and said that he would lend all
the assistance in his power to get at the
bottom of the scandal. "Although I have
no knowledge of the matter," said the
attorney, "1 will present any facts I ob
tain to the court in writing and under
i>ath." Judge Cook then recalled the
jurymen, and after many veniremen had
been examined, R. P. Mapleson and Julius
Buudman were accepteu, and the jury
was complete. To-day the taking of evi
dence will begin, and in all probability by
the end of the week Hoff will know his
fate.
Mclntoah, who is accused of gross
misconduct, was in court during yester
day's proceedings, and assisted In the
examination of "talesmen. He was cairn,
but manifested by his appearance that
he did not enjoy the notoriety that had
been thrust upon him. He is 'charged
with having offered a few days ago to
sell a confession signed by Hoff for $2000.
In offering the document it is said that he
commissioned Edgar B. Haymond, an
other attorney, to consummate the sale,
and declared that in offering the docu
ment he was actuated only by a desire
to save his client from the hangman's
noose. In the publication charging Me
lntosh with the questionable proceeding
he is quoted as saying: "Hoff will not
accept one cent undeo $2000 for his con
fession. He realizes that a great deal
can be done with money. Then, again,
his attorneys ought to be paid $700 or $800
for their work in his behalf. I fully
realize the seriousness of the situation.
I know that a man's life is at stake, and
I do not like to do anything that may
injure his cause and tend to send him to
the gallows. If his confession were pub
lished Hoff might have to change his
defense. He would have to deny the
truth of the confession or else justify it
in some way. The confession came to me
through Attorney Schooler. I took Mr.
Haymond into the secret because 1 knew
him and because I believed that he could
do something for my client."
Attorney Schooler emphatically denies
that he had any knowledge of either a
confession or an alleged confession, and
Hoff does likewise. In the face of these
conflicting statements, the District At
torney may have considerable difficulty
in clearing up tne matter to his own
satisfaction and to the satisfaction of the
court.
Appreciated Faithful Service.
Frederick C. Youngberg, who has held
a responsible position in the secretary
and controller's office of the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Railway Com
pany for the past ten years, haa received
an appointment with Messrs. Scott &
Van Arsdale of the Slsklyou Lumber
Company and other interests.
Mr. Youngberg was taken very much
by surprise this afternoon when he was
made the recipient of a handsomely en
graved diamond ring from the officers
and employes of the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railroad in appreciation of
his services and the esteem in which he
was held by all of his confreres. The
Inscription on the ring was "To F. C.
Youngberg from well wishers of S. F. &
N. P. Ry. Co., March, 1895."
Had Suffered Enough.
Christian Olsen, a sailor, was sentenced
to one month In San Quentin by Judge
Cook yesterday for a burglary com
mitted in September, 1893. Olsen was ar
rested while leaving a store at 120 Cali
fornia street, which he had looted. It
was found that he was insane and he was
committed to an asylum. Yesterday he
was discharged from the Institution as
cured, and Judge Cook thought that he
had suffered enough and gave him the
lightest sentence possible.
In Favor of the Defendants.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday rendered a decision in favor
of the demurrer in the case of
Henry D. P. Allen vs. Charles F.
Allen and Aaron C. Allen, defendants,
and dismissed the bill. The suit was
brought to compel the defendants to spe
cifically perform the terms of a certain
mortgage contract on real estate in Hura
boldt County.

Mary Eckert, age 22 years, living: at
2027 Mission street, took a dose of car
bolic acid shortly after midnight last
night. She was found by her husband
and removed to the Receiving Hospital.
It is expected she will die. The only
cause assigned for the act is said to be
the result of a surgical operation per
formed about two years ago, which great

WANTED TO GET RICH.
Several Hundred Dollars' Worth of
Valuables Stolen From the Russ
and the Lick.
There Is a young woman In the city
whom the police are looking for, and
when they find her, if they ever do, it is
more than likely that the lodgings she
has been seeking so assiduously will be
provided for her in a nice country loca
tion across the bay, where she will have
the most careful attention for the next
couple of years without costing her a
cent.
The particular graft of this young per
son, who Is about 18 years of age, wlht a
pretty baby face and an innocent, in
genue manner, is sneak thievery. Her
field of operations is the large hotels, and
her victims are the unsuspecting board
ers therein. She has already succeeded
in doing up people living at the Russ and
Lick ami vanishing without leaving any
trace behind her other than the dim re
membrance in the mind of the hotel clerk
of a pretty, youthful face and a stylishly
clothed, well proportioned figure.
The young lady, who is supposed to
have gotten away with several hundred
dollars' worth of clothing and Jewelry,
first made her appearance about a week
ago at the Russ.
She entered the house In an unobtrusive
manner, and, going to the parlor, played
on the piano for a while, then quietly left.
She came the next day, and continued to
come until Bhe succeeded in making the
acquaintance of Mrs. A. Scoiield. one of
the regular boarders of the house, to
whom Bhe confided the fact that she was
a young music teacher trying to make her
own way, and living at the Brooklyn,
f:om which house she intended moving, as
the accommodations were not what she
desired.
- Mrs. Scofleldâ now has the utmost
confidence in the young woman's abllty
to make that way of which she spoke
became interested in her and invited her
up to see her rooms. The girl went, and
came several times alterward, and going
upstairs knocked at Mrs. Scofield's room
when that lady was out. She was
watchedâ as her actions had by this time
become suspicious, and on one occasion
Mrs. J. S. Young, the wife of Colonel
Young, the proprietor of the Russ. who
has looms facing Bush street that are in

off that thoroughfare, and passing behind

She . informed the management of her
loss, and Colonel Young went to the Lick
to confer with Manager K. B. Soule of
that house, and arrived Just in time to
hear of the loss of a valuable mink cape
reported by an idlgnant lady guest.
There he learned that the' same young
woman had been seen around the parlors
and halls, and the supposition is that she
is some expert room-worker, and, watch
ing her opportunity entered the apart
ments of the guests during their absence
and carried off whatever she could lay
her hands on, carrying her booty away
under a long cloak she always wore.
The matter was reported to headquar
ters and Is now in the hands of the police,
who have a clew, as usual.
MRS. RYLEY'S
"MR. BUGLE"
A Farce of Some Humor, but
the Plot Lacks Sus
pense.
Improved Alcazar Acting â Farce-
Comedy at the California.
Other Shows.
With the auditorium half filled and a
lightweight farce on the stage, the
Baldwin Theater appeared to be sadly
nominal last nfght. The small audience
pointed rather pathetically the recent
triumph of the Bostonians, and the
small play, a fair sample of current suc
cesses, marked the unimportant quality
of the season.
The play was "The Mysterious Mr.
Bugle," by that industrious young wo
man, Madeline Lucette Ryley, and
called on the programme a legitimate
farce. The word "legitimate," which
has come to be a valuable bit of theat
rical slang, looks well in type, rolls well
from the tongue, and in these days of
lingerie festivals and leg carnivals, I
dare say, does good service In distin
guishing one sort of farce from the
other.
Mrs. Ryley's farce is, unquestionably,
the other; with one exception, which
doubtless is due to the sweet unworld
liness of the author, "The Mysterious
Mr. Bugle" is entirely modest, respec
table and virtuous. No young man
need to blush to take his father to see
it. And apart from the many respec
tabilities it has one funny little situa
tion and several darts of that rarefied
vaudeville repartee which has been the
spirit of other Ryley plays. There are
moments â little, idle moments â which
are quite comfortable; but as comedy
or legitimate farce or just plain old
farce "Mr. Bugle" is enthusiastically
unconvincing.
I admit that "unconvincing" i 3 al
most as vague a word as "legitimate,"
but as Mrs. Ryley hopes to be under
stood by one so do I by the other.
Even farce should carry sme convic
tion, should embody something: plausi
ble, in order to ensnare the legitimate
laugh. Mrs. Ryley never has been very
plausible in plot and construction, but
in both "Christopher Jr." and "An
American Citizen" she was industrious
even if not really inventiveâ she
seemed to try to make things look a
The fac-simile \/rf i^^*"' if on every wrapper

little bit probable. This time Mrs.
Ryley gives us a young Tom and
Betty, whose engagement must be kept
secret in order not to offend his grand
mamma, upon whom their prospects
depend. Betty and her sister, Julia,
are living at a hotel in New Jersey,
and, presumably to secure a certain
amount of liberty, Betty has registered
as Mrs. Solomon Bugle, a name which
she and Tom have agreed upon.
Without going into the details aris
ing from a visit in the night to Betty's
apartments by her oousin Allan and
her subsequent inability to account to
Tom for the absence of a doorkey,
which Allan has carried off, It can be
said that Tom is of a frightfully Jeal
ous disposition, and that the right cir
cumstances might almost justify hia
suspicions. But it is in the arrange
ment of such circumstances that the
piece is weak. Mrs. Ryley has not fin
ished one scheme before she is head
first into another, and has twisted and
tangled the vital thread of farce and
lost all the elements of surprise. When
the play reaches a stage wherein you
are asked to believe, in the most trust
ful spirit of fun, that Tom believes that
after all there is really a Mr. Bugle and
Betty has deceived him all along â well,
you can't see it for a minute and the
whole thing becomes clumsy make-be
lieve.
And, of course, this loose manner of
accounting for everything does not
tend to give special sanity to the char
acters. They are not those characters
of real farce who are sent here, there,
anywhere in a rush of plausible misad
venture. The actors of "Mr. Bugie"
have to resort to being funny of them
selves. Even Joseph Holland, an
artist, jumps and bobs and dances in
his efforts to galvanize the part of
Tom. In Betty Miss Gretchen Lyons
is robbed of brilliant acting by the wild
fluctuations of the role. Miss Winona
Shannon can be only frankly silly as
Sister Julia, and Lucius Henderson, at
best an affected personality, is hardly
of this earth as Cousin Allan.
The one clever situation to which I
alluded earlier is that in the first act,
where Betty accounts to Tom for the
cigar stump in her room by telling him
that she has become an inveterate
smoker. "I couldn't live without ci
gars," she says. "Then I'll save your
life" â and Tom sees to it that she
smokes a good inch of one of his own
perfectos.
The ingenuous indelicacy Is in the
cheerful manner in which Tom and
Allan settle it between themselves that
Betty's Mr. Bugle is their own house
servant. _^Â§>HTON STEVENS.
Alcazar.
If it were allowable to descend into
slang the expression to use regarding the
presentation of "The District Attorney"
at the Alcazar would be that it "tipped
the hands" of the stock company of that
theater. The whole company, or rather
that part of it which is included in the
cast, gave evidence of an ability that was
a surprise to old Alcazar goers. All did
well so well that one wondered why th<Â»y
have permitted themselves to do such
slack work in other plays.
The drama, "The District Attorney," is
one that permits strong action, and it can
be said that no point was lost or weakened
through C misconception on the part of
any performer. Wright Huntliigton, *n
the title role, lost his individuality, or, per
haps, personality is the better word, to
such an extent that he gave strong iden
tity to the part. While the entire east ii
deserving of especial mention tor oxcel
lerro. the individual work -if "William 11.
I'UHcoe as Frank Plerson, Wallace Shaw
a* JMutliev/ Bralnard, and of Miss Ocr
trude Foster as Grace Brainard. added
strength to the presentation. Bryant's
MoGralh was the customary stage pollti
cir.n, and, as that, was well played, but
It lacked a little of the distinction of real-
ity.
Wallace Shaw as General Haggles, and
Frank Denithorne as Wel.'r.^rton Grl'iley,
made capital showings, and Miss Castro as
Helen Knight in the third act gave evi
dence of real ability. Taken as a whole
the rerformance is a record for the little
stock company. \ . '.
California.
It Is a year and a half since "Town
Topics," the piece now playing at the
California, was first presented in this
city at the Columbia, without scoring any
particular success. Some new specialties
have been Introduced since then, and all
the parts, except those played by World,
Keller and Mack, are in the bands of new
people. Still, it is practically the same
showâ a rough and howling farce comedy,
the only signal difference being- thut 50
cents is now the highest price. After all,
the price cuts considerable figure in the
theatrical business, and largely deter
mines the character of the audience.
"Town Topics" is now able to attract a
crowd that is quite in touch with its
mode of fun. On the Rialto it is rumored
that Friedlander, Gottlob and Marx are
so pleased by the success of this venture
that they will undertake making a feat
ure of cheap shows at the California,
Orpheum.
There are fine names on the new Or
pheum bill, notably John J. Burke' and
Will H. Fox, who stand for many a big
success here in the past, yet neither
Burke nor Fox is as startling as usual
this timo because, like many other clever
vaudeville players, they have lingered too
long with the old, old acts. Burke has
been in Australia for many months, and
returns with practically the same act in
which he said au revoir last season; Fox
has added a few new wrinkles to his
Paderewski turn and taken to singing
"The Red, White and Blue" In a voice
that is more patriotic than beautiful.
Both men are clever, but on the whole,
a bit behind in the procession. Albert
Athas and Lizzie Collins, from Australia,
are making their American debut. Miss
Collins is a sister of the famous Lottie:
she sings in large, spieler voice, and
dances with weight and difficulty. Mr.
Athas is very limber-legged and clowns
with considerable vivacity.
The best of the performance is in last
week's hits, which are still emphatically
on top. Sabel has a new coon song, and
Rudihoff an unlimited stock of pictorial
inspiration.

lish melodrama of Irish locale, was

Contests Her Husband's Will.
Clara Augusta Gordon Wilson filed a
contest yesterday to the will of her hus
band, John C. "Wilson, who died In this
city on February 24 last, and asks the
court to revoke the order made on
March 15, admitting the document to pro
bate. Mrs. Wilson was not named in the
â will, and she states that an unintentional
oversight on the part of her husband is
responsible for the fact. Mrs. Wilson has
three children, ana she prays that the
property be distributed in the same man
ner aa though her husband had died in
testate.
A Boy Sues for Damages.
Edward Gibson, 13 years of age, com
menced suit against the Market-street
Railway Company yesterday for $10,000
damages for the loss of his left leg on
December 9, 1597. The boy was endeavor
ing to board a Valencia-street car when
he fell under the wheels and his leg was
so badly crushed that it had to be ampu
tated. He alleges that the accident was
caused by the negligence of the defend
ant's employes.
MUST REPORT
SICK HORSES
Chief Lees Aims a Blow
at Veterinary Surgeon
Westphal.
Determined That He Shall Not
Further Impose on the
Department.
Tho City Will in All Probability
Build Its Own
Stable.
Chief Lees intends that hereafter
Veterinary Surgeon Westphal shaJl not
use the Police Department in adding to
j his bank account. Yesterday he is
! sued an order to his captains compell
j ing them to make daily reports to him
I of the number of horses used in the
patrol wagons, whether they belong to
! the city or not, and also the stray
j horses which are picked up by the po
' lice and which find their way to West
! phal's stables. If one of the city's
horses Is taken sick the Chief de
mands that the captain under whose
charge the animal is to at once report
It to him. By these means the Chief
expects to considerably reduce West
phal's heavy demands on the city
treasury.
At the next meeting of the Board of
Supervisors a proposition -will be made
by the Chief of Police to rent a lot in
the Mission for the purpose of erecting
stables for the horses of the Police De
partment.
"This is about the only large city in
the world," he remarked last night,
"where the police department does not
own its stables. I am in favor of pur
chasing a suitable site and erecting
stables thereon.
"This would not only prevent the ]
heavy and sometimes exorbitant de
mands of stable men on the city treas
ury for maintaining the horses of the
Police Department but would reduce
the expenses several thousand dollars !
a year. I have nothing to say against '
Westphal except that we all realize j
that he is increasing his bank roll at
the expense of the city. At the next
meeting of the Supervisors I will en
deavor to correct the evil by asking
that body to buy a suitable site so that
we can have our own stables. The !
horses and wagons would then be under
the absolute control of the Police De
partment."
Captain Wittman feels sore over the
statement that he is the only Captain j
of Police whose horse is cared for at
the expense of the city.
"All the captains have horses," he
remarked last night, "which are main
tained by the city. It is necessary that
we should have horses, as it is impos
sible to cover our respective districts
on foot."
He, however, believes that Westphal
is fast getting rich at the expense of
the city.
Martin Bulger's Funeral.
The funeral of the late Martin Bulger

By Which One May Break the Health and

SAN JOSE, March 14.â James W.
Rea, theSlocal political boss, will be
made defendant in a suit for slander
which is to be filed to-morrow by J. P.
jarman, the New Charter Club candi
date for Councilman-at-large.
Driven to desperation by the clean
and unassailable methods and the in
vulnerable ticket of the New Charter
Club, the "gang" has been resorting to
every trick and device known to cor
rupt politics to discredit the movement
for good government and those active
therein. Not daring to impeach by
open and fair means a single one of the
candidates put up by the Charter Club,
recourse has been had to the spreading
of malicious and slanderous reports by
word of mouth concerning the club, its
members and its candidates.
In singling out J. P. Jarman, whose
record while in the Council is beyond
reproach, and who stands with the very
best in this community, the "gang"
caught a tartar. While a member of
the Council Jarman had committed the
unpardonable sin, according to the
catechism of the gang, of not "stand
ing in" with the despoilers of the public
treasury. For this he has been hounded
ever since.
The action that led to the determina
tion to bring suit against Rea is told
in the words of J. P. Jarman:
"I was standing on First street," said
Mr. Jarman, "just south of the broad
gauge track this morning, supervising
some of my men who were painting a
house there. Rea approached from the
south and greeted me with 'Good morn
ing.' I made a remark about a man of
his character not being worth saying
"good morning' to. He said: 'What do
you mean?' I said he had been acting
the part of a coward, stabbing me in
the back with the good citizens of San
Jose. I told him he had been to Joseph
R. Patton, E. A. Kayes, S. G. Tomp
kins, Harry Edwards, Rush McComas.
Archie McDonald and T. S. Montgom
ery and told those men that I had made
$600 out of the purchase of a steam
roller for San Jose, and that to others
he had said I made $900 out of it. I
then said:
" 'I want you to understand that you
have told what is an absolute lie, be
cause no one knows better than you
that while I was in the Council my ev
ery action was in the interest of San
Jose, and that I was only one out of
eight, and that I was never" in co'lusion
on any proposition."
"He answered. 'What I have said be
hind your back I now repeat; that
there was $900 paid on the purchase
of that steam roller to some of the
Councilmen and that you got $400 of
it/
"I told him he was an infamous liar
and a disgrace to his family and to
mankind in general, and a disturbing
element in the community. He then
remarked that if I were an able-bodied
man he would thrash me. I replied
that I was not afraid of him in any
way he might choose to meet me, and
this ended the incident."
Mr. Jarman has lived in San Jose for
thirty years. He was brought up and
educated here and there has never
been a charge of dishonorable conduct
In private or public life made against
him. He feels this attack keenly and
does not propose to rest under the
stigma sought to be placed on him and
his family by those whose only object
is to further their political ends.
A. H. Jarman, a son of the ex-Coun
cilman, is an attorney. He has been
instructed by his father to bring suit
for heavy damages against Rea for
slander. He will have associated with
him E. A. Wilson. Besides the wit
nesses mentioned by Mr. Jarman in the
foregoing interview, there were sev
eral persons present to-day when Rea
repeated the attack upon Jarman on
the public streets.
It is trie intention of J. P. Jarman to
bring the steam roller transaction to
the attention of the Grand Jury. He
hopes by this course to be able to show
where the money went, if any was paid
to induce the Council to purchase the
steam roller from J. H. Maggard. Jar
man was chairman of the Street Com
mittee which recommended the pur
chase of the steam roller, but the pur
chase was not actually consummated
until after he had ceased to be a mem
ber of the Council. It was not pur
chased until it had been, given a week's
trial under the supervision of the pres
ent Council, which comprises J. P. Fay,
W. T. Nolting, George B. Dittus and
Julius Krieg.

Reduced From Affluence to Perj
ury, C. E. French of F^edlands
Con)n)its Suicide.
REDLANDS. March 14.â C. E. French, at one time considered one of
Redlands' richest men, cut short his life with knife and bullet this
morning. French returned on Febuary 1 from Chicago, where he had
been for eighteen months operating on the Board of Trade and lost a
fortune of several hundred thousand dollars. Reduced from affluence
to penury, he returned to Redlands, where he lived for a number of
years and had hosts of friends, and here ended his life.
At one time French owned a handsome home and considerable busi
ness property in Redlands. He had cornered the hay market, but his
hay was burned. His wife soon died, and then he sold his property at
a sacrifice and with his little daughter returned to Chicago. He went
on the Board of Trade, was a plunger, and collapsed six months ago.
French married his second wife in November, 1896. When his fortune
was lost she returned to her home in Massachusetts. Realizing that
he could not live long, as consumption was dragging him down rapid
ly, he straightened all his affairs and arranged for his funeral with
out creating suspicion. After 10 o'clock Sunday night he cut the
arteries of his left arm above the elbow and at the wrist with a dull
pocket-knife. He caught the blood in a bathtub.
When the blood ceased to flow he took a pencil and wrote of his
failure to end his life by this means. He said he must resort to
butchery. He arose, put on his dressing-gown, got a revolver from a
valise he had packed to send to his wife, locked the valise, put the
key into an envelope addressed to his wife, adjusted towels above his
head to (%tch the blood and fired a ball through his head at the middle
of the forehead. No one heard the shot. He was found dead this
morning by his sister.
French had left letters to the postmaster, to the former manager of
his affairs and to his second wife. With the latter epistle was a $5 bill,
which he said was his "last five."
The suicide of French was one of the strangest ever recorded. After
the loss of over a quart of blood he calmly wrote the directions for
the disposal of his letters and belongings. His handwriting was steady
and unchanged from the ordinary.
French was 50 years of age. He was always pleasant and cheerful,
even when he realized that he must die of consumption before many
months. He had no enemies.
WILL PROSPECT
ON THE COPPER
Small Expedition to Sail From
Puget Sound To-
Day.
Ooes Well Outfitted With Supplies
on the Schooner
Hero.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 14.â A small expedi
tion, in charge of W. C. Button and H. L.
Moore, will sail to-morrow on the three
masted schooner Hera for the mouth of
the Copper River. It will go well out
fittted with supplies, and. has planned to
ascend the Kink River to its headwaters
and cross thence to Copper River. The
latter would be struck just at the begin
ning of the big bend to the eastward.
The plan is to prospect the headwaters
of the Copper River and then, crossing
the divide, go to the Tanana. It is ex
pected that gold will be found on either
the Tanana or the Copper.
Sutton. who is backing the proposition,
will send four men around by St. Michael
to go by steamship up the Tanana to the
head of navigation and camp there until
joined by his party. The idea is that the
four men can bring relief supplies and aid
in the development of strikes.
"I was in that country last year with
three companions," saia Moore this even
ing, "and have prospected all through
that country. Everywhere we went gold
was found in quantities that would pay
$5 or $7 a day, but nowhere would it have
paid to work. 1 believe that the upper
Copper River is rich, and we will get
there if any one does. Of the many peo
ple now heading that way very few will
ever reach the Tanana. It is a hard trip
and one that only strong men should un
dertake."

BERRY CHARGED
WITH ASSAULT
Klondike King Sued by
a Man Whom He
Whipped.
James Bethel of Selma De
mands Pay for the Loss
of an Eye.
Scrimmage of Six Years Ago Re
called by the Issuing of a
Summons.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, March 14. â Clarence J.
Berry, the Klondike king, has gone to
San Francisco, and in a few days will
sail for Alaska, to bring home in the
fall his share of the output of his
claims on the Klondike, which have
been worked during the winter. But
after him was sped a summons in a
$25,000 damage suit brought against
him this afternoon for an assault which
is alleged to have "been committed six
years ago. The action was brought by
James Bethel, who alleges that he lost
the sight of his right eye on account of
a beating which' he received from
Berry.
The complaint recites that on June
10, 1892, at the town of Selma, Berry
violently assaulted the plaintiff, caus
ing the permanent loss of his sight.
For loss of his eye Bethel demands
$20,000 damages. He further alTeges
that he suffered excruciating pain from
the assault and believes $5000 would
about compensate him for that.
Although the assault was committed
nearly six years ago, the statute limi
tation does not apply, for the reason
that Berry has been out of the State.
Berry last fall returned from the Klon
dike with nuggets galore. He imme
diately invested in diamonds, which
would sparkle from his shirt bosom and
scintillate from his fingers. So great
was the display of wealth by the re
turned Klondiker that he was yclept
"Klondike King." Bethel then con
cluded that if Berry had 'money to
burn" he (Bethel) ought to have some
of those nuggets for tne injury which
he suffered at the hands of the Klon
diker before the latter went to the gold
fields and made his rich strike.
A complaint was hastily prepared to
day and filed. A summons was im
mediately issued and sent to San Fran
cisco on the first train and will be
served upon Berry to-morrow.
It is not definitely known how soon
Berry intends to board the steamship
for the far north. The suit will not in- i
terfere with his contemplated trip, it i
is thought, for he will probably not pay
any attention to it. At least that is
what the plaintiff expects, but service J
will have been secured on him and that
is all that is desired at the present time.
When he returns from Alaska asrain.
with more nuggets, in all likelihood the
suit will be tried.
ATTACHMENT SUIT
AGAINST A BANK.
Friendly Action Involving a Formal
Demand for a Dead Man's
Estate.
SAN JOSE, March 14.â Attorney W. C.
Kennedy of this city has begun attach
ment proceedings against the Bank of
British North America of San Francisco
to compel that Institution to give over
$2100 belonging to the estate of Samuel
Johnson to Public Administrator Secord.
The suit is a friendly one and only a for
mal demand for the money.
Johnson, who was an ex-soldier and
nearly 70 years of age, came to this city
five months ago. He complained of sick
ness and entered a private sanitarium on
North Third street. The next day he be
came insane and attempted to jump from
a second-story window. He was arrested
and committed to Agnews Asylum, where
he died a week later.
Among his effects were found certifi
cates of deposit showing he had over $7000
in various banks. A brother and sister
in Eastern Canada are the heirs. Public
Administrator Secord applied for and
was granted letters on the estate.

In his reply to the City Council,
which offered the public T>uilding to the
late General Rosecrans' family, his son
Carl wrote:
"Your kind offer of the City Hall as
a temporary depository for the remains
to lie in is accepted by the General's
family as the most fitting place for the
people to take a last look at the great
commander, who was ever their
friend."
Among the telegrams of condolence
received by the family to-day were the
following:
You have my deepest sympathy In the
loss of your father, my old comrade,
whose patriotic services to his country
we will always gratefully remember, and
whose character will ever be affection
ately cherished by his comrades.
WILLIAM McKINLEY.

Chauneey M. Depewâ My heartfelt sym
pathy is with you all in your bereave

sented to General Rosecrans during the
war by the citizens of Cincinnati, Ohio,
also the headquarters fla~ which he
used at the battle of Carnifex Ferry,
and which was torn to tatters by shot
and shell. On the sword is engraved
a paragraph of the speech General
Rosecrans delivered to the Legislature
, f West Virginia when he turned that
State over to the civil authorities. It
reads:
"My mission among you is that of a
fellow citizen charged with the duty
by the Government of restoring law

DUNHAM SUSPECTED OF
MASSACHUSETTS MURDERS.
Sheriff Lyndon of Santa Clara
County Goes East to
Investigate.
SAN JOSE, March 14.â Sheriff Lyndon
left for the East with Edwin A.
Lowe, who embezzled $1800 from the New
ton, Mass., postoffice; but ostensibly the
trip is taken for the purpose of investi
gating the report that a number of mur
ders committed at Brookfield. Mass., a
few months ago were the work of James
C. Dunham, the slayer of the McGlincy
family at Campbell. Sheriff Lyndon was
especially deputized by United States
Marshal "Baldwin to take Lowe East, and
will be gone three weeks.
It is said the murders at Brookfield
were perpetrated by a man answering
Dunham's description, and the mode of
killing was the same as in the case of
the McGlincys. an ax being used. It is
known Dunham has relatives in that part
of Massachusetts, and there is a prob
ability that the Brookneld murderer and
Dunham may be one. Sheriff Lyndon
thinks that may be the fact, and the
trip is made to satisfy himself in that
particular. The Brookfield assassin has
never been caught.

MIDDLESBOROUGH, Ky., March 14.â
The smallpox situation here has become
so serious that the Government has sent
Past Assistant Surgeon Wertheimer, of
the United States army, to take charge
of the pesthouse. The State medical au
thorities surrendered only on orders from
Frankfort. The county refused to sup
port the pesthouse, and the inmates were
011 the verge of starvation. There are
seventy smallpox patients and 400 sus
pects. "This entire community is alarmed
and almost demoralized, as the disease is
epidemic in the adjoining counties in Vir
ginia and Tennessee.

Bound, trip from Mill Valley $1 T^RELIGIOUS PARALYSIS IN SONG
Quite a stir was created at the meeting of the ministers of the Christian
Churoh when Rev. A. M. Elston of Berkeley made an attack on some of
the time honored hymns sung in Protestant churches, in a paper on "The
ministry of music In the church services." The speaker declared that
music should always be used in all the churches. He stated that it did
good and increased devotion. Singing was one of the sweetest acts of wor
ship, and all should take part in the service of song.
He spoke in strong terms against such hymns as "Jesus, Lover of My
Soul," "The World Is All a Fleeting Show." "I Would Not Live Alway,"
"The World's a Wildorness of Woe' and "They Shall lay Their Burdens
Down."
"Singing." he said, "is calculated not only to quicken the singer's piety,
but also to infuso like feeling in others. A lecturer in the East not long
ago tri.d to prove that the tendency of music is to demoralize rather than
elevate. Perhaps the reason for this conviction is that much of the con
gregational singing contains neither good music, good poetry nor healthy
religion. To some the songs of the church are the means of emotional
raptures instead of true spiritual enjoyment. To others they are senti
mental opiates that put to sleep. To others a clinic that soothes and re
freshes their sick souls. To others a sleeping car in which they are car
ried to the ski- s on flowery beds of ease.
"The sentiment of the song does not always correspond with our convic
tions. We sympathize with the converted Jew. who being told that he
must eat pork as a proof that he was a real Christian, thus protested in
song:
" 'Oh, must we eat the flesh of swine.
Because Lord Jesus we are thine?"
"Again, some people's religion fluctuates with the phases of their hope
and hence no songs are more popular with such than those that express
these fluctuations:
" "How tedious and tasteless the hours when Jesus no longer I see,
Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flowers have all lost their
sweetness to me.'
"Or the more doleful strain:
" "Tis a point I long to know.
Oft it causes anxious thought;
Do I love the Lord or no;
Am I His or am I not?'
How deplorable the condition of a Christian who can sing such songs with
spirit and understanding. In religion we want reality. Wherever else we
may be in doubt, here we crave the unchanging, immutable, the eternal.
Nor would 1 have the church sing that theological falsehood, woven Into
verse, 'This world is all a fleeting show, for man's illusion given.'
God never did belittle His omnipotence by creating anything for a
fleeting show, or for man's illusion. That sentiment must have
been composed by a Christian Scientist. It is no evidence of true
piety for a Christian to sing, even when in the depths of despair,
would not live alwny, I ask not to stay,' or 'This world's a wilderness of
woe.' Surely he is" not rrmking the best of life or he would wish to live
;!S i,, ng as possible. This world is not a wilderness of woe, except to him
who makes it so. Even heaven would be a wilderness of woe to him that
would make the earth such.
"Sometimes a chronic indifference or a religious paralysis prompts some
to sing:
" 'Hide me, O my Savior, hide.
Till the storm of life is past.
Give me, Lord, a glorious ride
And receive my soul at last.'
"Other lazy Christians forecast the time in song when 'They shall lay
their burdens down.' but before singing that with the spirit and under
standing they should be sure first whether they have taken any burdens up.
We are not placed here simply to die, or travel a wilderness of woe, or to
hide or lay burdens down." â 
Mr Elston suggests that instead of these hymns the people should sing
such as, "Am I a Soldier of the Cross?" "Soldiers of Christ Arise," "I
Love Thy Kingdom, Lord," and others.
BIG GUNS
FOR HARBOR
DEFENSE
Formidable Land Bat
teries Are Able to
Defend the City.
Presence of the Battleship
Oregon Is Desirable, but
Not Essential.
*
Tremendous Fire That the Great
Cannon Could Concentrate
on a Hostile Ship.
TARGET-PRACTICE ORDERS
General Shafter Looking for a Light
Artillery Range in the San
Joaquin Valley.
Some people seem to fancy that the
ixture 6f the battleship Oregon to
Join the great squadron at Key West
would leave San Francisco without
proper protection. There is no good
cause for such apprehension, because
the forts guarding this harbor are ca
oable of standing off any fleet that
Gpain could send to the Pacific. The
country may need the services of the
battleship Oregon to form a line of
battle with the lowa and Indiana as
an object lesson or something more for
the Spanish.
The military authorities understand
xv hat is needed for the protection of
this harbor. If an element of weak
ness existed the. Secretary of War
would be advised of ..he weak places.
tThe Monterey, Monadnock, the Phila
delphia and Charleston are within easy
reach to assist the batteries at Fort
Point, and Lime Point.
Much important work has been done
on the land during the past thirty days.
The ten-inch battery at Fort Point has
been reinforced by the addition of two
guns, so there are now five ten-inch
lifles in position. Five twelve-inch
guns commanding a fine sweep of the
ocean can be depresseu to bring under
fire a ship attempting to pass through
the narrow channel between Lime
Point and Fort Point. Three more
twelve-inch guns at Fort ISaker, to
gether with the sixteen mortars and
three dynamite guns on the peninsula
can also be brought into use at long
or short range. When one considers
the possible concentration of fire at the
narrowest point of the Golden Gate it
can be understood that a hostile fleet
'here would have little chance of sur
vival. A steel projectile of the twelve
inch rifle weighs a half-ton. When a
full charge of 450 pounds of powder is
applied the projectile obtains a force
lent to pierce the armor of any
ironclad that floats. The great guns
on Limp Point, nearly five hundred feet
above the water, are so high that a
plunging fire against the deck of a ship
may be delivered. a ..
The fact is readily appreciated by the
army and navy authorities that San
Francisco is not in a defenseless condi
tion, and while the presence of the Ore
gon in the harbor may oe desirable the
ship is not essential to the protection
of the city.
The large supply of ammunition which
came from Benicfa Arsenal recently
-has been placed in the magazines of
Athe Presidio and Lime Point. The
â¢iigh-power guns are inspected every
day, so that everything shall be in or
der for immediate use. Word comes
from the East that a very large supply
of ammunition to replenish the stock
in the arsenal at Benicia is on the rail,
so whatever the conditions may be
elsewhere in the United States it can be j
said that San Francisco is not at the
mercy of a hostile fleet. The work on
the fortifications is progressing with so
much speed that the new battery of
sixteen 12-inch rifled mortars will soon
be ready for use.
Troops at the Presidio receive no
signs to indicate that they will be sent
south. Officers of the First Infantry
believe that the regiment will remain
at this station, even should war with
Spain be declared. The rumor of change
of station to meet war contingencies
has not pointed to any change in the
distribution of forces on this coast. Ac
tual war would require an increased
force of men at the high-power guns,
and hence soldiers of the infantry
might be utilized for that duty in pref
erence to volunteers.
Orders were issued yesterday from
the headquarters of the Department of
California announcing' target practice
as follows for the current year:
Heavy artillery â The month of April.
Infantry â The months of May and
June. *
The practice of the companies sta
tioned at Benicia Barracks will be held
at the Presidio, under special instruc
tions to be issued hereafter by General
Shafter.
It is not settled yet where the tar
get practice of the light artillery will
be held. It *â *â" place near Redwood
City last year and there is where the
defective shrapnel was discovered by
Captains Potts and Califf. The de
partment commander is looking this
year for a new range. Last week he
sent Major Edward Field, artillery in
spector, and Lieutenant John D. Miley,
Fifth Artillery, on a trip through the
San Joaquin Valley to find a desirable
place. The officers returned ip head
quarters last Sunday. They found
some good places for light artillery fir
ing in practice work and also found
water and other accommodations. A
range of three miles, with freedom from
houses and other interposing objects, is
necessary. It goes without saying that
every man of the artillery service will
have hi#eye on the shrapnel when the
shells of this pattern begin to fly.
The Third Artillery at the Presidio
will soon receive a new lieutenant-col
onel to take the place of Colonel E. B.
Williston, promoted to command the
Sixth Regiment. It is thought that
Major W. F. Randolph, commanding
the light artillery battery at Fort
Riley will come to the Presidio. He
goes up to the grade of lieutenant
colonel, and is likely to be assigned to
this station to succeed Williston.
The soldiers in this department are
heartily glad that General Graham
gets an important command at the
front, or the prosepctive front, on the
gulf. The soldierly qualities of the
general are appreciated by the officers
and men who served under him at this
and other stations.
BEAT) IT IN THE CALL.
Natives of Italy Are Anxious ts Go
to the Gold Fields of the
Klondike.
The California-Alaska Navigation and
Commercial Company was in receipt yes
terday of a letter from Italy asking for
information about the Klondike and the
beat way of getting there. It was under
the date of February 25, from Plan de
Drrla. San Columbane, Chivari, Italy,
and was as follows:
Sirs: Having read considerable in The Call
about the discovery of gold in Alaska and the
prevailing excitement. I wish to state that
many young men of this environ who are able
to raise the passage nnd outfitting money are
f>riKÂ»r to undertake the voyage. We wish to
obtain all the Information possible, I mean
such as would be required In traveling from
your city to Dawson. Respectfully yours, t
A. GAOLIARDO.
The writer in a portion of the letter
asks for the specific kind of advice that
he desired. The officials of the company
anticipate that quite a large number of
fortune-seekers will come from Italy.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 15, 1898.
CITIZENS OPPOSE
THE BOULEVARD
Bush Street May Still
Be Open to Public
Travel.
The Supervisors Recognize a
Scheme to Obstruct
Traffic.
Yellow Journalism Receives a Roast
at the Hands of Supervisor
Smith.
The Board of Supervisors heard a vigor
ous protest against the establishing of a
boulevard on Bush street yesterday when
J. M. Manning appeared before the meet
ing and demanded that the Supervisors
give the matter a full and thorough hear
ing before deciding or declaring the thor
oughfare a boulevard.
Mr. Manning declared that he repre
sented 12,000 front feet of Bush, street, and
that the majority of property owners
were against the boulevard.
He said that the scheme to make a bou
levard was put up by a certain street
railroad company, and that It was against
the best Interests of the citizens who live
on Bush street.
Supervisor Clinton supported the peti
tioner* and expressed his opinion that
many of the signatures on the petition for
a boulevard had been purchased, either
by influence or otherwise. It was finally
decided to hear the matter as a special
order of business at the meeting of the
Street Committee that will be held a
week from Thursday next. At that time
all parties interested will be represented
and the question of boulevard or no bou
levard will be definitely settled.
Supervisor Smith expressed his opinion
of sensational Journals that publisn un
founded reports regarding the actions of
the board. He said that a morning paper
had published a report that had tended to
convey the impression tnat the Judiciary
Committee had "stood in" on certain ball
bonds that were known to be shaky. He
called on the records to show that the ac
tion taken had been on the advice of the
attorney employeu to look into the matter
and that the committee was not to blame.
J. H. Robinson was engaged as special
attorney to collect from the State the
money that is claimed to be due for the
maintenance ot orphans. His commission
will be 15 per cent.
The City and County Attorney was in
structed to appear for the city in the suit
brought by the Italian Benevolent Society
to test the right of the city to prevent
burkils in the City Cemetery.
The site selected for the new City and
County Hospital was approved.
The Clerk of the Board was instructed
to advertise for bids for the lighting of
public buildings for the next two years.
Bids for the paving of Market street
from Second to Fifth were received as
follows:
City Street Improvement Company, $20,
000, with an allowance of $5000 for old
material; Facific Paving Company, $23,750,
with $100 allowance for old material; San
Francisco Paving Company, $25,850, with
no allowance; Fred J. French, $25,857, $1
allowance; Alcatraz Asphalt Company,
$26,241 30, no allowance. The matter was
referred to the Street Committee.
Mayor Phelan presented a veto of cer
tain bills for the public lighting, claiming
that they were in excess of the amount
allowed by the one-twelfth act.
The order allowing boxing permits on
the payment of $100 for each exhibition
was finally passed.

WILL RESIGN HIS STAR.
LIEUTENANT OF POLIGE GEORGE W. BENNETT.
At the next quarterly meeting of the Police Commissioners for the pur
pose of retiring officers on pensions there will be presented the application
of Lieutenant George W. Bennett of the Potrero district.
The reason to be advanced for the retirement of Lieutenant Bennett on
pension is the advice of his physician who has been attending him since
last January at which time he sustained a stroke of paralysis.
The cause which led to his late illness was brought about by his devotion
to his duty in remaining out of bed without tasting food for thirty-six
hours when in pursuit of a burglaT named James Meinhan. who broke into
the residence of a widow in the Potrero named Mrs. Kane and stole several
articles of value, among which was a gold watch and chain valued at
$175 The theft was reported to Lieutenant Bennett, and he at once started
out "to run the culprit down. In this he succeeded after a lively chase of
several hours' duration, and without taking either sleep or refreshment he
stayed out until he found the stolen property on Capp street, where Meinhan
had disposed of it to a companion. After so successfully landing his man
and securing the property he returned to the station and there was stricken
with paralysis.
The San Francisco Police Department has no better nor truer member
on the force than Lieutenant Bennett. During the twenty years that he
has been on the police force the records show over 11,000 arrests to his
credit, and during all this time he never lost a prisoner or made an arrest
that had no merit.
Immediately after his appointment to the farce Chief Crowley assigned
him to the South San Francisco station in 1878, where, with the late Officer
Rosekamp all that, then, wild territory was placed under their charge. In
1879 Bennett was placed in charge of the Potrero district, then a lonely
outside section, the rendezvous of cowboys and toughs who made the place
unfit for residence. But Bennett started in to run them out and he suc
ceeded to the entire satisfaction of the Chief of Police, as well as those
whose business took them across Long Bridge. So well were his serv
ices appreciated at headquarters that he was promoted to be a sergeant in
1889 anS further rewarded by being made a lieutenant two years ago.
Outside of his police record he has another which he appreciates still
more. It is as follows, and speaks for itself:
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. George W. Bennett, Massachusetts Regi
ment First Artillery: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, honoring the faith
ful services of her sons who formed a part of the land and sea forces of the
Tnited States employed in suppressing the rebellion and maintaining the in
tegrity of the nation, has by a resolve of the general court of 1869, directed
the undersigned to present you this testimonial of the people's gratitude for your
patriotTsm WILL CLAFLIN, Governor. â 
JAMES A. CUNNINGHAM, Adjutant-General.
Given at Boston this 19th day of April, 1870.
Young Bennett joined this regiment at the age of fifteen years and
served all through the war.
Consequently he has every reason to be proud of his public career which
will terminate next month, after twenty years of faithful work for the peo
ple of San Francisco. He will (with the consent of the Commissioners) draw
half pay for the balance of his life. His retirement will be regretted by all
who know him, and none more than the men under his command. During
his twenty years he never yet reported a subordinate to his superiors. His
kindly disposition won for him absolute obedience from those under him.
His successor will have a district free from thieves and vagabonds.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March H.â The stock and bond
markets were atronjj throuKhout to-day. Dif
ferent opinions were offered as to the cause
of this and probably all had some truth In
them. That the excess of buoyancy was a sur
prise to many professional traders was evi
dent. There was nothing In the news of the
day to change materially the political outlook '
and that there were many holders of securities i
who continued nervous was evident from the !
larjje offerings to realize which met the sharp |
rise at the opening;, but the reaction which re
sulted from these offerings was more than
overcome, even those stocks which showed the
largest gains at the opening rising again to
the highest at the close, which should be
less affected than the opening, in some cases
to a point above the early high prices. Prices
of Americans were advanced in London before
the opening here. This was the more notable
on aÂ«j|iunt of the acute depression of the
Spanisn Government 4s, which fell 2% in Lon
don on Paris selling and showed an extreme
decline of 1"Â» in Paris. The. course of these
bonds has been looked to as a true Index of the
diplomatic relations between the United States
and Spain. This discrepancy might mean that
capital looks favorably upon the excellent
financial and Industrial conditions In the
United States In spite of the danger of war,
or it might mean that the acute financial
distress of the Spanish Government detracts
from the value of its bonds In spite of tne
chance of peace. It Is not to be lost sight of
that United States bonds In the local market
declined % per cent In the bid price in the
face of the strength of all other securities. It
Is possible, however, that the stiffening of the
money rate may have accounted for this move
ment. Certain it is that there was a very
large covering of short contracts which has
been left open over Sunday on the belief that
some new and dangerous developments were
imminent In our relations with Spain. The
firmness of prices was sustained to the close.
This was a demonstration that the underlying
strength of business conditions in the country
would quickly bring about a recovery of prices
upon any relaxation of the tension over the
Cuban case.
Gold continues to be engaged abroad for Im
port, to-day's announcements aggregating con
siderably over $4,000,000. The fall In the rate
of exchange on Paris and Berlin and the re
lative steadiness of the rate on London Indi
cates where the pressure of gold Is being felt
and there was a response in the stiffening of
the money rate in Paris and Berlin. Money Is
still moving to the interior from this point and
receipts of gold had no effect to-day in easing
the money market. Over $1,000,000 will be
withdrawn from the market to-morrow and
conveyed Into the treasury for the second pay
ment on account of the Kansas Pacific sale.
Nearly all active stocks are from 2 to 3 per
cent higher as a result of the day's trading.
Prices of railroad bonds rose in sympathy with

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 14.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: Americans
continue unsettled and, feverish, the chief de
pressing Influence to-day being Paris, -where i
the Bourse* was demoralized by the fall In I
Spanish securities and the Coulisse agitation. !
The severe slump in Americans in New York
on Saturday attracted the attention of buyers
here and prices opened 1.60 above the New York
parity. New York responding to this later. A
further improvement took place with conside- j
rable influential buying for Germany, but the !
close was dull in the street. Kaffirs, which I
have dull the last few days on Paris condi
tions, closed panicky on the news of the mur
der of Woolf Joel, the existing head of the firm
of Barnnto Brothers.
Indications of a continuance of dear money
still exists.
A large amount of gold was bought for
New York to-day. The question of a rise in
the Bank of England's rate on Thursday is
much discussed.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. March Wheat showed some
strength at the opening, although It was not
of very long duration. Besides the favorable
effect Letter* application on the : board of di
rectors for a margin price of May Wheat had
on traders, both English and Continental mar
kets show unlooked for strength. Liverpool
opened lower, but quickly advanced to a point
above Saturday's figures there, and Paris also
reported somewhat higher prices. July, which
closed Saturday at 87%@57%c, opened to-day at
87T4c. For about fifteen or twenty minutes
there was quite good support by shorts and
not a little reinstating of lines which had been
supported during last week's decline was ap
parent. July was advanced to 88c, the high
point of the day, before the reaction started.
Then the influence of the favorable weather
and bearish routine news began to be felt.
Almost no support of consequence was given
the market until about an hour from the close,
July In the meantime coming down to 86% c.
At that price there was a good deal of cover
ing, principally by local shorts, and the de
cline was checked.
September also suffered, although but a
limited business was done In that delivery. It
started %@%c higher, at 79%@79%c. and when
July reached its lowest point had declined- to
78% c. 'May was offered In large quantities, the
pit crediting 1 most of the selling to Armour,
who was reported a buyer of Wheat at Min
neapolis. Lelter brokers, however, gave this
end of the market unwavering support and
succeeded In holding the price at $1 04, al
though they had to absorb about 500.000 bushels
to do so. â  .
During the last hour's trading July advanced
to 87c, but slid down again to S6%c and closed
easy at 86% c. September closed at 78 7 /4 c.
Corn was a fairly active market and a
fairly steady one. May closed a shade higher.
Oats were dull. The close was steady. May
closed unchanged.
Provisions were weak from the start. The
weakness of grain markets and the uncer
tainty over the Cuban situation were the fac
tors. May Pork 12% c lower. May Lard closed
6%c lower and May Ribs Be lower.

TEMPTING LUNCHEON I^CIPES.
A relishing dish for luncheon or tea is
made in the following manner: For
cracker mix one tablespoonful of grat
ed cheese, half a saltspoonful of salt
and one-fourth of a saltspoonful of
white pepper. Spread the hot crackers
with this mixture of cheese and sea
soning, return to the oven and warm
until the cheese is melted. You may
also make a brewis for tea by prepar
ing the crackers and cheese in this way,
putting them into a buttered shallow
earthen dish, adding one-fourth of a
cupful of milk for each cracker and
baking until it is brown, or until the
milk is absorbed. This is all easy, and
I assure you it is very nice as well as
inexpensive. â Sallie Joy "White In

KILLED WHILE
GOING HOME
Inspector Faria's Sense
of Duty Led to
Death.
At the Hospital He Asked That
He Might See His
Family.
Died In His- Young Wife's Amu as
HÂ« Was Sending Â» Farewell
to His Children.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 13.
As John Faria was returning to his
home this morning lie noticed a defective
switch and stopped to repair it. He had
nearly finished when an engine ap
proached. Faria jumped out of the way,
but only to be struck by another engine,
and injured so frightfully that he died at
noon.
Faria is an inspector employed by the
Southern Pacific, and his fidelity led to
his death. He was not required to touch
the switch that he saw was loose, but he i
â was too conscientious to Ignore it. He has ;
always shown marked attention to duty,
and during the nine years he has been in
the employ of the railroad he has been
promoted till he was a track inspector.
Five minutes after he saw the loose j
switch he should have been home, but he i
was destined never to see his home again, i
He did not notice that there were sev- j
eral switch engines flying about the j
yards, and he went on his knees to work. ;
An engine approached from behind, and it :
was dangerously near before he observed
It. He leaped on to the adjacent track
and was not aware that some freight cars ;
were being shunted upon it. Before he j
could collect his wits he was knocked ;
down and fatally injured.
The injured man was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, but no relief could be |
afforded him. Six years ago ho was
married, and he is the father of two little
children. He knew he was dying, and
made a request that they be brought to
him. His wife was sent for and arrived j
before the end, but he died without seeing ;
his little ones.
A scene such as occurred at the hospital !
is not a frequent one. "\\ vile the suffering
man was approaching death. Revs. Gloria i
and Slavin were offering the final com
forts of the church, while tho doctors at
tempted to allay the Intense pain, anu the ;
unhappy young wife wns taking a final i
embrace and listening to a farewell to
take to the two little tots at home.
NO RECEPTION,
BUT A FUNERAL
Miss Flossie Schultz Dies on
the Eve of Leaving for
the East.
She Had Given Promise of Ability
From Which Much Wai
Expected.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 14.
The death of Miss Flossie Schultz, who
Tras to have been tendered a swell recep
tion to-morrow night at tne home of Mr.
and Mrs. F. M. Smith, has cut short the
life of one of the most promising young
actresses that California has knoMPn.
Miss Schultz is the daughter of Mrs.
Martin Bchultz, the well-known soprano
of the First Congregational Church, and
had only been sick a few days of a cold
which developed fatally. Not until yes
terday morning was it known that Miss
Schultz was ill. and then the news was
made known through the absence of Mrs.
Schultz from the choir.
Mrs. Schultz had made all arrange
ments to leave this week with her two

Hotel of Pleasanton, a landmark there for
thirty-five years, was totally destroyed by
fire at an early hour this morning. The
loss will aggregate fully $10,000, but was
well Insured.
Two young men who had Just returned
from a Sunday evening visit to their lady

sparks across the creek. The bridge
caught fire from the sparks, but was
saved by buckets of water.

CUTTING OUT
THE RAILROAD
Realty Syndicate's Plans
Driving Merchants
West.
Changes Being Made All Aim
to Keep People Off
Broadway.
OnÂ« by One All the Big Firms ArÂ«
Going to Washington
Street.
Oakland Office San Francisco
90S Broadway, March
The many changes in the arrangements
of the street car lines that are controlled
by the Realty Syndicate are having a
marked effect on realty values, and will,
to a certain extent, guide the progress of
this city for the next ten years or more.
To-day, another announcement was made
that the biggest and oldest furnishing
house on Broadway will soon move to
Washington street.
The Southern Pacific roads on Broad
way are the only two lines that are not
controlled by the syndicate, with the ex
ception of the Haywards road, and the
combine is now engaged in diverting as
much travel as possible from Broadway,
and it is succeeding. Within a month all
the travel from Berkeley, Alameda, East
Oakland, "West Oakland and Fruitvale
will be centered on Washington street.
Not a single branch of the syndicate
lines are doing anything to help Broad
waj . neither do any of its lines transfer
to the Broadway route.
In consequence of the gradual diversion
of traffic to Washington street, business
has followed, and within the past five
years nearly all the big Broadway firms
have gone west. When the Oakland Gas
Company bought and built a fine block
at Thirteenth and Clay streets, many
were found who laughed at the venture,
and referred to it as being out in the
woods. Now large blocks have been built
toward it with great rapidity, and there
Is no doubt that the next move will be
to have Washington street cut right
through to San Pablo, so as to further
divert travel from Broadway.
The Southern Pacific lines can only run
out Broadway to Berkeley and to Emery
ville, and cannot transfer to any line
going east and west. This Is, of course,
a great advantage to the syndicate roads,
which transfer anywhere and every
where.
It is again reported that before the
opening of another racing season at
Emeryville there will be ;m electric road
running to the track, and as the syndi
cate has thousands of acres of land under
option in that neighborhood there is
probably some truth in the report that
BLOOD WIPED OUT A GRUDGE."
Biff, bang, and the crimson liquid poured from the nasal append
ages of two young men who fought In the first place to wipe out a dis
agreement and in the second to see who was the better man from a
physical standpoint. The disagreement had arisen between Joe Kane,
who earns a livelihood driving a delivery wagon for Levin Brothers,
and Jimmy Riley, who drives a dray, because neither would give up
the right-of-way on the road, and In consequence a collision took place.
The outrage, as both declared the incident to be, was well turned
over In their minds and in consequence the match was arranged and
last evening it took place In the basement beneath the San Francisco
Road Club's rooms. At about 10 o'clock Jimmy Riley was on the scene
and commenced to prepare for the fray. All the lights In the building
with the exception of one In the rear end of the basement were ex
tinguished and a billiard table which has seen better days was car
ried by Riley and his friends in a position so that the light would not
be run Into. Curtains were drawn and the place was patrolled by
trusty co-conspirators to keep the police from swooping down on thÂ«
blood-thirsty gathering.
Joe Kane arrived soon after his rival and he in a few moments
was ready for the mill. Harry Fitzgerald, who at one time trained
Lawler, was chosen as referee, Al Neal of the Manhattan Athletic Club
and Tom O'Brien were the seconds, and the secretary of the road club
acted as time-keeper. The men who were about to fight for honor and
the right of way then took off their shoes, trousers, coats and shirts
and agreed not to hit in the clinches and to break clean. The rule
was, however, dispensed with on numerous occasions.
Then they were at it. A left swing, then a right, a clinch, a
knockdown and the mill became interesting. Kane, although much tall
er and heavier than his opponent, had the worst of it in the first round
as Riley "soaked" him In the nose and the flowing blood all but choked
him.
No water, towels or fans, or even what the Board of Supervisors de
mand, five-ounce gloves, were on hand, so the fighters went at It bare
handed and wiped the blood from all portions of their craniums with
their clothing, which had been strewn around the floor during the
struggle. The fight became bo vicious that the small gathering present
took refuge behind the table and the way Fitzgerald holloed for the
men to break away was enough to bring down every officer from the
City Hall to the scene of battle as it was but two blocks from the
prison. The back door was unfastened at this point in case of an
emergency.
At the time for a one-minute rest according to all ethics of the prize
ring the tired men were vigorously farmed with a flannel shirt and
a pair of trousers. They both came up fresh for the second go and
the blood flew all over the room. After a few well-directed blows Kane
landed a "beauty" on the point of Riley's chin and he reposed on the
edge of the billiard table. He cried enough and the mill wai ended.
Upon examination it was discovered that Riley had received consider
able punishment and Kane was petting a swelled and reddened nose.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 15, 1898.
the pier at Emeryville, built four years
ago by F. M. Smith, the borax man, will
soon be put to some use.
The Southern Pacific is also anxious to
extend the San Pablo line to the race
track, and when C. P. Huntington was
here about a year ago he gave out the
idea that soon one large power house will
be used for local trains, and also for
street car lines. Now that the syndi
cate's opposition is so active it will likely
be met by the carrying out of the
schemes of the railroad that have been
so often exploited.

Husband Against Wife.
ALAMEDA. March 14.â Mrs. P. W.
Fonda of 1313 Park avenue has been
charged by her husband, who lives in
Bast Oakland, with grand larceny for
moving a quantity of furniture to the
locality given in this city. Fonda is over
70 years of age and his wife about 40. The
couple did not agree very well and a
short time ago Mrs. Fonda left her hus
band and moved to this city. Each party

DEFENDS THE
DIVORCE LAWS
Ex-Judge Gibson Talks
of the Causes of
Separation.
Lawyers Could Often Prevent
a Divorce by Giving
Advice.
The Jurist Tells Why He la a
Much Happier Man Than
Huntington.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jviarch 14.
Ex-Judge Gibson told some of his ex
periences in divorce matters before a
crowd of young people at the Y. M. C. A.
to-night. He defended the divorce laws
of California, and said if they were car
ried put to the letter there would be little
fault found with them. The speaker
said:
"The causes of divorce are not so much
the fault of the law as of society. The
same conditions that produce tramps,
poverty and dissipation are responsible
for divorces. The laws of California do
not make divorce easy. There are only
six causes for divorce recognized by law,
and in the case of cruelty or habitual in
temperance these conditions must have
prevailed for not less than one year. A
woman ought not to be compelled to re
main the wife of a drunkard or a cruel
husband. Our laws, if properly construed,
can scarcely be said to work an injury to
society, but In many cases it has been a
great boon to poor suffering victims of
improper marriages. .
'â¢jftarely does it happen that divorce is
wanted in a home where there are chil
dren. It is in childless unions, where
selfishness and not love reigns, that hus
bands and wives go to the courts. Many
people want too much. A little home, a
few pictures and books and flowers, a
happy family and the means to have rea
sonable amusement these are all a man
can have, and are, in fact, all that the
wDrld can .give.
'â¢1 am a great deal happier than C. P.
Huntington. He wants too much, and Is
overcome witn care taking care of it after
he gets it. He can only use as much of
this world's goods as I can, and 1 do not
â¢nvy him. I have been married many
years, and I have three daughters and a
home, and 1 find my enjoyment there.
There is no fear of divorce in such a
home as that. While I was on the bench
I was convinced that one-half of the di
vorces could have been avoided had law
yers given other advice and sought to
heal breaches rather than widen them.
As an attorney, 1 always try to keep hus
band and wife together rather than to
separate them. To a certain extent hus
band and wife are blind, and when they
lay their troubles before -an attorney,
quite often a solution of the difficulty
can be found without a resort . to the
courts.
"If a man is true enough to win a pure
woman's love, as a rule he will remain
so if his affection be reciprocated. One
thing is certain, if the principles advocated
by the Purity Club be followed out, law
yers will not fatten on divorce fees." . .
BOSTONIANS WELCOMED.
Oakland Society Turns Out En Masse
to Hear "Robin Hood."
OAKLAND, -larch 11.â Oakland's Blue
book materialized was at the Macdonough
Theater to-night. T-ie slurs of third-rate
companies that cannot fill the playhouse
that this city is not appreciative were
wiped out most effectively, for society
did as it has often done in the past â it
turned out en masse to hear and see the
Bostonians. Not since l>e Wolf Hopper
was here has such a social display been
made at the Macdonough and the event
proved that Oakland can be moved with
something really good.
To some extent, San Francisco frowned
on "Robin Hood," and this was enough
even without Henry Barnabee and Alice
Neilson, to Insure its being warmly re
ceived here. For once, a great audience
in Oakland was enthused. No matter how
great its appreciation, a Macdonough au
dience rarely condescends to show it. but
to-night was an exception. Sometimes
encores were thrice repeated, and the
company was as anxious to repeat as the
audience to listen. Kvldently the fact that
the company ordered a keg of beer put
aboard the train when it left last time
and forgot to pay for it has not .hurt its
reputation, nor is Barnabee, who was
credited with getting ahead of Colonel
Wettsteln, any less popular on that ac
count. The company plays two more
nights, with a matinee Wednesday.
Stole the Collection.
OAKLAND, March 14.â Thieves broke
Into the Thirty-fourth Street M. E. Church
some time after services last evening and
stole the collection, which amounted to
J5. It is the habit of the officers to leave
the evening collection locked in the desk
of the superintendent of the Sunday
school. Some one must have known this,
for after effecting an entrance this desk
was broken open and the money re
moved.

RAGAN'S CASE
IS DISMISSED
Judge Cook Decides That
He Has No Jurisdic
tion to Try It.
The Grand Jury Must First
Find an Indict
ment.
The Disappearance of Stanton Leaves
the Case of the Prosecution
Very Weak.
In the semi-darkness of Judge Cook's
courtroom the trial of Dr. Ragan, charged
with selling positions In the School De
partment, was called last evening, but,
after a brief hearing, the case was dis
missed.
The proceedings opened with a motion
by H. S. Aldrich. attorney for the prose
cution, for a continuance of the case. Mr.
Aldrich stated as his reasons that at the
last moment Attorney Deuprey had with
drawn and it was impossible to find Stan
ton, who was the chief witness. Judge
Cook ruled that while there had already
been ample time to prepare the case, he
doubted if he had jurisdiction to try it
without an indictment by the Grand Jury.
Attorney Foote, for the defense, staled
that they were wi.-^ng to waive any
tecnnicalltles that might arise from a
lack of jurisdiction, and urged that the
case dg heard.
K. S. KiJpatrick was then called as the
first witness for the prosecution, but
he and his attorney managed to maice an
almost hopeless muddie of the case in less
than ten minutes. He first testified as to
the number of years he had known Ra
gan, his business relations with him and
the number of teachers employed in the
Lincoln Evening School; that on January
1, 1597, there ware fourteen classes and
twenty-eight teachers In the school and
that teachers had been sent to him by
Ragan.
"Were there any more teachers than
necessary?" asked Mr. Aldrich.
This question was objected to by Mr.
Foote, on the grounds that the court had
no means of knowing whether the witness
was competent to .state how many teach
ers were necessary.
"Do you know if Ragan ever demanded
money for the appointment of teachers?"
The court permitted this question, pro
vided the witness would answer it direct
ly. Mr. Kilpatrlck seemed unwilling to
implicate himself, and declined to give a
straight answer. He beat around the
bush for a while, and finally his answers
were ordered stricken out as irrelevant
and not to" the point. The next question
of "Do you know if positions were sold?"
met the same fate as its predecessor, and
was also stricken out.
The prosecution then started on a new
tack, but met disaster at the outset. They
nought to prove that Ragan had either
knowingly caused an unnecessary num
ber of teachers to be appointed, or had
neglected his duty in not informing him
self as to what teachers were necessary.
As there was no allegation of neglect of
duty in the bill of complaint, these ques
tions were not allowed, and Judge Cook
announced his intention of dismissing the
case, as he had no jurisdiction to try it.
While his Honor was making himself
solid on points of law and jurisdiction,
Aldrich was unmercifully taunted by the
attorneys for the defense for the weak
ness of his case and was advised when
he found himself in such a predicament
again to withdraw decently, as his col
league Mr. Deuprey had done. He took
it all good-naturedly, however, and re
plied that he "was not a quitter, but
would stay with It as long as there was
anything to stay with."
As soon as this ordeal was over, the
prosecution had another to stand. Attor
ney Boyer objected to the quiet dismissal
of the case, and argued that the prosecu
tion be compelled to substantiate some of
the accusations they had publicly made
against his client and that they also be
cited for contempt of court.
"These gentlemen," he said, "are cer
tainly in contempt and have trifled with
this court, as they knew they had no case
to present. As late as half-past 2 to-day
they were out searching for evidence.
Mrs. Clara Stark, vice-principal of the
Hearst Grammar School, is in court will
ing to swear that she was visited by
Messrs. Atherton and Kilpatrick late this
afternoon. They had with them an affi
davit to the effect that Ragan had tried
to extort money for a promotion from
her, and a subpena which they would
serve on her as soon as she would sign
the affidavit. She refused to sign, but
requested that the subpena be served on
her. As soon as they found she would
not sign the affidavit they refused to
serve the subpena and withdrew."
Judge Cook declined to take this advice,
however, and advised the prosecution if
they still'thought they had a case against
Ragan to bring it before the Grand J*ury.
MRS. SCHULLER
IS STILL ALIVE
After Her Wounds Had Been
Dressed Yesterday She
Went to Sleep.
According to Hep Statement His
Relatives Have Bean Tolling
Lies About Her.
Mrs. Eugenia Schuller, who was shot
three times by her husband in his office
last Sunday, was resting easy In the Har
bor Receiving Hospital last night. She
suffered considerably during the morning,
but after her wounds had been dressed by
Dr Zabala she felt much better and went
to sleep. Last night Dr. Deas said she had
a bare fighting chance for her life, but
that nothing definite would be known for
some time. .Â».._-_Â« .
During the day Mrs. Schuller received a
great many visitors and spoke her mind
freely with anybody and everybody.
"There are many dark secrets that I can
unfold," said she. "I wish to correct the
statements made by Mrs. Charles C.
Maxon. She hates me and has not told
the truth about me. My husband married
me for my money, but I forgive him. I
forgive all his family who have so cruel
ly treated me. His daughter, Mrs. Maxon,
told the reporters that I was acquitted of
the charge of arson, because it was shown
that my mind was affected. That was a
lie. I was acquitted because I was inno
cent.
"Mrs. Maxon, the daughter of Mr.
Schuller, has ill-treated me when she
should be grateful for one of the kindest
things it is possible for one woman to ao
unto another. Her husband, while still
legally united to another, had married
Miss "Schuller in this city. The former
Mrs. Maxon of Bay City. Mich., had come
clear across the continent to gain ven
geance upon her husband and to put the
brand of shame upon the child of the sec
ond wife. It was due to my efforts, my
pleadings, that the second Mrs. Maxon
agreed to a divorce upon the payment of
$1000 that the second marriage could be
made lep.il. Yet now they seek to vilify
me I have been robbed of my all and
now I must die in poverty. It seems almost
beyond the power o/ human endurance,
yet I must bear it, 'and truly I toes> v *
them."

COLNON GRILLED
IN OPEN COURT
Attorney Matt Sullivan
Speaks Plainly of His
Business Methods.
Mr. Stratton Comes in for a
Share of the Attorney's
Cutting Remarks.
Tha Harbor Commissioners Accused
of Favoritism in No Un
certain Terms.
In his argument before Judge Be'cher
yesterday Attorney Matt Sullivan
vented his opinion on Harbor Commis
sioner Colnon and his associates for
their dishonest methods in conducting
business on the water front. While on
this subject, Mr. Stratton, the board's
legal adviser in the present proceed
ing, received some of the attorney's at
tention. Mr. Sullivan told the court
that Strattc-n had acted in a dual capa
city when he advised the board to re
ject the Paraffine Paint Company's bid
and advertise for new ones, as he was
acting as attorney for Messrs. Slade &
Dundon, who were interested in the
San Francisco Timber Preserving Com
pany, a corporation which was bidding
against the Paraffine Paint .Company.
Legal arguments as a rule become
tiresome, owing to their technical scope,
but thrcrugout the day Mr. Sullivan
held the attention of the court and vis
itors by his clear statement of the man
ner in Which his clients had been
treated.
At the outset Mr. Sullivan told the
court that Mr. Stratton was attorney
for Dundon and also for Slade, and that
these two constituted the firm of the
San Francisco Timber Preserving Com
pany; that Slade himself was the sole
member erf the S. E. Slade Lumber
Company and Dundon was a member
of the firm of Darby Laydon & Co.
'â¢Within a period of about a year,"
said Mr. Sullivan, "the S. E. Slade
Lumber Company, Darby Laydon & Co.
and the San Francisco Timber Preserv
ing Company have drawn from the
treasury a large amount of money,
amounting to something like $130,000 or
$140,000. When the awarding of these
contracts came up the Paraffine Paint
Company was the lowest bidder, offer
ing to do the work under all the pro
cesses for less than it had ever been
done before. The board, instead of con
sulting its regular attorney, Tirey L.
Ford, who was admittedly well quali
fied to attend to the matter, called upon
Mr. Stratton, who was the attorney of
Dundon and Slade who were bidders."
At this point Mr. Sullivan called the
court's attention to the testimony of
Tirey L. Ford, who, although regu
larly appointed and a paid attorney of
the board, refused to represent it in the
matter, as he had already refused to
defend the board in the suit brought
by the Healy, Tibbets Company, in
which the board was charged with
favoritism in dealing with the Timber
Preserving Company. He then brought
out the point that the Board of State
Harbor Commissioners had no author
ity to employ special counsel. Sec
tions of the code and decisions of the
Sunreme Court were read, showing
that the board had no right whatever
to employ special counsel. "The law
expressly provides that the regular se
lected attorney shall attend to all the
legal business of the board, and that
when necessary it may call upon the
Attorney-General who must gratuitous
ly render all services which the board
requires; that the employment of Mr.
Stratton was illegal, and that the large
amounts paid to him by reason of his
special employment have been illegally
paid, and that the board and their
eurleties on their official bonds are
liable to be mulcted in damages; *that
their only reason for employing Mr.
Stratton was because he was or had
been the attorney of S. E. Slade and
Dundon. who constituted the San
Francisco Lumber Company.
"The law provides," said Mr. Sulli
van, '"that the contract in a matter of
this kind should be awarded to the
lowest bidder, unless in the opinion of
the board the bids are too high they
must be rejected. The board rejected
the bids not because they were too
high, but because Mr. Stratton had
advised them to do so."
Mr. Sullivan then went on and quoted
authorities to show the absurdity of
Mr. Stratton's advice when he directed
the board to throw the bids out because
they were not opened on the day as ad
vertised.
He devoted the rest of the afternoon
to picking out portions of Mr. Strat
ton's and Colnon's testimony showing
that a condition of fraud, corruption
and favoritism pervaded the adminis
tration of affairs on the water front un
der the present regime, charging par
ticularly that Mr. Colnon was the head
and front of all the fraud and corrupt
practices now prevalent and that no
cautious or prudent business man or
corporation would under any circum
stances ever put in a bid to do public
work on the water front as long as
the present practices are carried on.
He particularly charged Mr. Stratton
with being responsible in a great meas
ure for the prevailing evils on account
of the peculiar dual capacity which he
occupied as adviser of the boards un
lawfully selected by them and paid by
them as special counsel in direct viola
tion of the statutes of the State, and at
the same time representing private in
terests that have admittedly been In
strumental in filching from the State
treasury a vast amount of money with
out competing for business as the law
required and through favoritism ex
tended by Mr. Colnon to his clients.
Mr. Sullivan will conclude his argu
ment this morning when Mr. Stratton
will reply.
CRIMINALS WITH PRIORS.
Judges May Take Cognizance Thereof
in Passing Sentence.
The Supreme Court handed down a de
cision yesterday that -will he of great in

of violations of the law. The case in
question was that of one Patrick Kelly,
who was convicted of burglary in the sec
ond degree, for which offense the maxi
mum sentence is Â«ye years in the State
Prison. In this instance the judge sen
tenced Kelly to the full extent of the law,
and then added five years more to the

sentence, the second Installment being 1
based on the ground that Kelly had a
prior conviction against him in the crim
inal records of the State. An appeal was
taken on the ground that the fact of the
prior conviction was not properly pre
sented to the court; also that the clerk's
records do no show that the last half of
the sentence was on account of the prior
conviction.
The higher court holds that the judge
in passing sentence may take cognizance
of the prior conviction although the fact
of its existence may not be formally in
troduced in the case under consideration.
And further, that while the clerk's rec
ords should be more explicit in the re
cording of a sentence, still, In the present
matter, the omission was not of so much
importance as to make the sentence void.

SENATOR BUND
WAS EXTENDED
In Receipt of Weight
From Ostler Joe and
Hard Ridden to Win.
Mossbrae Overturned All the
Good Things in the
"Baby" Race.
Bellicoso in Great Form â Olive Gal
loped In a Winner at Long
Odds.
There was one good race at Oakland
yesterday, but the other five events decid
ed were of the trashy sort. When Senator
Bland came down here with the balance
of H. L. Frank's string of horses last fall
he was heralded as another Hindoo, capa
ble of giving Ostler Joe anywhere from
ten to thirty pounds on a beating. He may
have been able to do it in Montana, but
he la not equal to the task now. The
chestnut horse has either deteriorated, or
else Ostler Joe has vastly improved. The
two met in the mile and a furlong, the
Senator a 1 to 2 chance in the betting, be
ing in receipt of ten pounds from the
black horse. Spencer cut out the running
with the favorite, and traveled on velvet
to the bend for home, where Thorpe be
gan riding Ostler Joe for all that was in
him. He was unable to overhaul the Sen
ator, but* had him extended to the last
pound to win by a length in the fast time
of 1:54. "With equal weights up the black
horse would have won beyond peradven
ture of a doubt. Scarborough was played
to some extent at long odds to win the
race, but had to be content with the show.
Favorites more than got their share of
the pudding, four of the six events falling
to first choices. The air was cool and
seemed to have a depressing effect on
speculators, for the betting was badly
broken up.
Of the original twenty-two entries in
the opening seven furlong run ten were
scratched. Charley Thorpe had the mount
on Don .Luis, and the chestnut gelding
was played down from twos to 3 to 2
favoritism. He showed in front soon af
ter the start, and at the wire won easily
from Baracan, a 15 to 1 shot, ridden by
Spencer. Moringa was on hand, as usual,
at the end to taKe the show.
The Burns & Waterhouse entry, Bane
wor, opened an even money fay -He for
the "baby" event at four furlongs, but
the crowd preferred Formero. forcing his
odds down from 2 to 1 to 8 to 5, Banewor
receding to S to 5. Thorpe got the latter
away in front, and she led until the
paddock was reached, where ciawson got
up with the 8 to 1 chance, Mossbrae, and
won cleverly by a length in :49Vs. The
favorite was third, close.
The mile and a sixteenth selling event
attracted a field of rifteen to the post,
Conley's mount, Earl Cochran, closing a
slight favorite in the betting over Ver
agrua and Tulare. Passing the stand the
first time, Tulare was in next to last
position, but as the stretch was reached
Weaver had him in front. The Fresno
gelding looked" ail over a winner, but
when challenged by Earl Cochran could
not respond, and was beaten a length.
Spencer rode an ill-timed finish on Ver
agua, managing to fall into third place at
the wire.
J. Naglee Burkes big sprinter, Belli
coso, seems to have regained his old form.
He won a sprint on Saturday last in
handy fashion, and the six-furlong spin,
fifth on the card yesterday, fell to his lot.
He went to the post a 9 to 10 choice, and,
getting a flying start, won all the way.
In a drive, H. Brown got Refugee in
aJiead of Chihuahua for the place.
The last race decided, a six and a half
furlong affair, was capmred by the 10 to 1
shot, Olive, with ileDonald up. The mare
assumed the front position when straight
ened for the wire, finally finishing three
lengths ahead of Twinkle Twink, another
outsider. None of the well-backed ones
seemed to have a particle of speed.

There were three or four starters in the
mile and a furlong run whose riders did
not "like" them. Veragua by the looks
of h!s race was undoubtedly one of them.
Bertnlacci & Co. took about $2000 out of
the ring over the win of Olive. The mare
ran in something like her old form.
"Skeets" Martin rides Bellicoso to per
fection. He apparently joilies the old
horse into thinking he is running away.
Mossbrae, the half brother to Osric,
took his race in clever fashion, and from
this time on will bear watching.
Jimmy McLaughlin, who has his string
in training at the Bennings track, recent
ly lost the good colt Demagogue from
colic.

A Chapter on How a Tower Floor Increased in Value and
Another Showing the Way of Changing a Fire-Proof
Steel Door to One of Wood.
In every department of the ferry
building, so far as investigated, there
has been found fraud. In some cases
the fraud has been so palpable, wonder
grows that the perpetrators had the
hardihood to even hope to escape de
tection. They either did not try to
cover up the evidence of their guilt or
they thought the public stupider than
It is. From the minute-books of the
Commissioners and from inspection of
the work the guilt of the criminals and
the manner of their crime is plain. But
the facts, boldly as they stand out now.
may yet be brought into more startling
relief.
It has been demonstrated that the
contractors have made the Commis
sioners propositions which could have
no other design than the swindling of
the State. Whether the gentlemen
failed to see this, or had a purpose in
permitting the State to be swindled, is
a matter to be looked into by the Grand
Jury. The contractors have been al
lowed to use cheaper materials than
called for in the specifications upon
which contracts had been based, and
to employ cheaper methods, but the
pay has not been reduced, and in more
cases than one it has been increased.
In other words, the contractors have
been made presents of public money
under circumstances which would have
permitted them with profit to have
made a considerable gift to the State.
The State pays for one sort of stone
and yets another. The stone finally
adopted was offered at thousands of
dollars less th~n the stone it replaced.
There was no reduction in the figure
when the cheaper grade was adopted.
If pays for one sort of floor and gets
another which cost nearly forty thou
sand dollars less to construct than
would have been the case had specifi
cations been followed. It not only gets
no reduction, but actually donates the
contractor a gratuity for his kindness
In accepting an Increased and unwar
ranted gain. It pays for white glazed
brick and gets marble, Concerning the
relative expense to the contractor there
is some question. Others who have
figured on the work say the marble is
cheaper by fifteen cents a foot. But
above the marble, the change having
been authorized at the time the marble
was substituted, there has been used
a quality of brick so distinctly inferior
to the style originally contracted for as
to mar the whole effect.
It pays for Roman pressed "brick,
worth $75 per thousand, to be used at
the outer ends, and gets common brick
which, laid in the wall, represent $14
a thousand.
These are incidents. Where is the
money which has been "saved"? In a
general way the answer is easy; there
has been no money saved.
When the Commissioners decided to
use pine instead of oak in the interior
finish it might have been supposed that
this would inure to the benefit of the
people, but it didn't. Such benefit as
there may have been found its way
into other channels. When Bateman
Bros, made a bid, which was accepted,
for finishing the interior in oak it may
be assumed they knew what they were
doing. When it is remembered that oak
costs about $85 a thousand and pine
only $16, the assumption is fair that a
contractor having permission to put in
pine at oak figures would have a good
enough thing without asking ah addi
tion. But the Batemans asked the ad
ditional pay, and got it. They put in
a bid for doing the work with pine. It
was an increase of more than $3000. To
give them this would have been an in
formality, as bids must be advertised
for on contracts of this magnitude. So
they cut down their figures by $800,
bringing them to $2995, and so retained
the work. Now, people want to know
why, Instead of getting more, these
contractors should not have received
substantially less.
It is true that by the new arrange
ment there was provided the building
of certain partitions not intended in
the first place, but there were left out
a large number of partitions that had
been planned. By letting the mezza
nine story stand incomplete there has
been saved to the contractors (not to
the State) $11,375. Of this, as the tabu
lated statement shows, a large propor
tion Is in the wood contract. Here is
the table as compiled by an architect
entirely familiar with the work:

In addition to the above there were to

on the second floor. They were to have

I commission has not abolish^- ' there re
' main in the first and second stories,
I once of oak, now of pine, upward of
I 2000 lineal feet.
Supposing, for the sake of argument,
that the Batemans, from their exten
sive dealings, could have secured their
oak at three times the price of pine the
change would still have been money in
their purses. There seems every rea
son to believe that they could have
carried out their contract without
| forcing the Commissioners into the pc
! culiar position of paying them extra
for doing it. This is virtually what
the deal amounts to. There is abso
lutely nothing to show that the Com
missioners had any right or any proper
reason for thus favoring them. They
seem to have been unduly favored by
the simple circumstance that the
change in material was made.
Not the least interesting chapter in
the history of the wholesale robbery
that has characterized the actions of
the men responsible for the construc
tion of the ferry building is that which
covers the seemingly insignificant item
of fitting the building with doors. The
doors, which are of the kind that raise
and lower like the top of an office desk,
have been put in by a contractor, who
has received the sum of $5570 for his
work. Contradictor^ as the statement
may seem to be. It is nevertheless a
fact that these same, doors represent to
the State an expenditure of something
over $9000. The extra 3000 and odd
dollars have been divided up between
the men who are reaping profit from
their manipulation of the building con
tracts. This fact will doubtless appear
in due time.
According to the original plans and
specifications, the doors for the various
entrances and exits to the ferry build
ing were to be constructed of the best
steel, besides being fitted with proper
counter-weights and other necessary
fittings. The doors now in position, in
stead of being fire-proof, are built of
Oregon pine. The official sleight-of
hand by which this change was brought
about will no doubt prove interesting
reading to taxpayers and others.
The contract for all of the iron and
steel work in the ferry building was se
cured by the Risdon Iron Works, the
contract price being something less
than $200,000. The item of steel doors
was included in this blanket contract.
The Risdon Iron Works does not manu
facture steel doors of the kind called
for in the original specifications, so, in
order to put in an intelligent and profit
able bid on this particular item, the
firm asked for and received bids for the
work from firms that make a specialty
of that style of work. By this means
the Risdon Iron Works people ascer
tained that the doors could be con
structed and put in at a cost, to them,
of about $8000. This amount, plus a cer
tain percentage of profit, formed one
of the items that went to make up the
sum total of their bid for all of the iron
work.
After the contract had been let the
Harbor Commissioners, for reasons
known only to themselves, conceived
the idea of changing the style of the
doors from steel to wood. Satisfactory
plans were submitted by Edward B.
Hinds of 411 Mission street, and he was
finally awarded a contract to put the
new style wooden doors in at a cost
of $5570. Negotiations were then opened
with the Risdon Iron Works, with the
following result: In consideration that
the firm was released from the neces
sity of constructing the doors as per
the original contract the firm agreed
to deduct $4000 from the sum of the
original blanket contract. As the work
would have cost the Risdon Iron Works
$8000, this agreement meant a profit of
$4000 to the firm. Whether or not this
was net profit, only the men who en
gineered the deal know â and they won't
tell.
Edward B. Hinds, who secured the
contract for building the wooden doors
now in place. Is frank in telling all that
he claims to know of the transaction.
"I put in the wooden doors," he said
yesterday, "and received my pay. The
contract price was $5570. As for the doors
as they stand, I have no hesitancy in
saying that I believe them vastly supe
rior to the steel doors called for by the
original specifications. I also manu
facture steel doors and put in a bid to
the Risdon Iron Works for the doors
called for by the original specifications.
I had nothing to do with the actton of
the Harbor Commissioners in changing
from steel to wood and therefore know
nothing' about anybody making any
money on the side. If any private un
derstanding existed between the Com
missioners and the Risdon Iron Works
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 15, 1898.
people I would be the last to hear of it.
All that I know is that I did my work
and got my money for it. I made a
fair profit and am not anxious to find
out how other people make their
money."
Hinds' contract, the amount sub
tracted from the sum total of the Ris
don Iron Works contract and all of the
proceedings by which the changes were
brought about appear on the records
kept by the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners, and are not disputed by any
member of the board.
A fair illustration of the manner In
which contractors on the Inside are
reaping a rich harvest at the expense
of the State came to the surface a few
days ago. It will serve to show one of
the many plans of procedure. The firm
of Bateman Bros., referred to above,
has the contract for putting down all
of the floors in the ferry building for a
stipulated lump sum. This includes the
floors of the numerous stories of the
tower. Some time ago the Commis
sioners decided to leave out six floors
in the tower. Bateman Bros, were in
formed of this decision, and after some
haggling agreed to take $119 off the
stipulated contract price in considera
tion of being released from the ne
cessity of putting down the six floors.
This was agreed to. A few days later
the Commissioners again changed their
minds. This time they concluded that
It would be necessary to have built
one of the six floors before discarded.
The contractors were again called for
and asked how much they would
charge to build the floor. The reply
was that it could not be built for less
than $210. The matter of awarding the
contract was taken under advisement.
Six floors at the rate of $210 a floor
would amount to $1260 â work for which
the contractors only allowed $119 when
it was a question of allowing for work
not required by the State.
So day by day the chapters are
added to the story. There are more to
be told. Perhaps the people are yet to
have the felicity of knowing where their
money went; of knowing why when
they furnished funds for the erection
of a ferry depot on a certain plan the
plan was changed, cheapened, and now
the money is insufficient to even bring
the work to completion on the new
scale, the mezzanine story awaiting the
raising of future funds.
THE TENDERLOIN
WATCHING LOW
He Holds the Case of the
Notorious Tom Ellis in
Abeyance.
The " Push " Turning Heaven and
Earth to Secure the Defendant's
Release.
The case of Thomas Ellis who shot Ar
thur Lawson at 850 Market street, on
February 28, will come up before Judge
Low for decision on Wednesday. There
has been a great deal of interesting evi
dence, some of which was to the effect
that the defendant was in the habit of
often beating and threatening to kill
Josie Norton, whom he was beating at
the time of the interference of Lawson,
which resulted in his being shot.
Mrs. Howes, proprietor of the house,
is much interested in the case, because
she has heard time and again that there
have been desperate attempts to have the
case settled out of Court. In spite of all
attempts of the friends of the notorious
defendant the case has remained on the
calendar, though there are great efforts
tf have it squared.
When the case was on hearing a few
days ago it was noticed by Special Prose
cutor J. N. B. Wilson that the regular
prosecutor of the court, as well as the
Judge, seemed eager to minimize the of
fense. The Judge even asked the young
! man who was shot whether he would not
: be satisfied to have the defendant pay a
j fine, whereupon the victim of the bully's
shots answered that he wanted the de
| fendant sent where he would not be able
j to do any more shooting.
All of the ward heelers want the case
j squared, and the eyes of the tenderloin
j are upon Judge Low. He was warned by
I Attorney Wilson that it would be infam
ous to allow the caee to be squared, but
Ellis has boasted that he will never be
cinched in Low's court.
There was plenty of evidence, as sev
i eral witnesses swore that the night
< watchman was shot while he was trying
j to prevent the defendant from killing the
I notorious woman with whom he lived,
i Judge Low has determined to decide the
| case Wednesday.
In the Divorce Courts.
Anna Clara Hohs was granted a divorce
from her husband, John F. Hohs, yester
day on the ground of extreme cruelty.
The defendant was ordered to pay the
plaintiff alimony in the sum of $10 a
month for the support of his minor child,
the custody of which was given to its
mother. Lincoln E. Lewars was granted
a divorce from Laura B. Lewars on the
ground of willful desertion. Gertrude E.
Burgess was granted a decree of divorce
from C. S. Burgess on the ground of will
ful neglect. Rosalie Moser was granted
her application for a divorce from her
husband, Lewis Moser. The decree was
granted on statutory grounds.

"SPIDER"
KELLY IS
KNIFED
The Pugilist Slashed
Out in One Round
by Solly Smith.
Joe Goddard Steps in and
Gets His Nose
Spoiled.
Almost Fatal Result of a Re
fusal to Partake of
a Drink.
NO ARRESTS TO BE MADE.
The Injury Is Not Dangerous and
Kelly Exp^cs Soon to
Got Even.
As a result of a row kicked up In his
saloon by Solly Smith, the well-known
sporting man, "Spider" Kelly is now
laid up in bed with a wounded shoulder
and Joe Goddard is nursing a badly
wounded nose.
Smith entered Kelly's saloon about
9 o'clock last night, bringing with him
a bad temper and a good jag. He
called for a drink, but Kelly, thinking
the man already had more than
enough, ordered the bartender not to
give it to him.
"What's the matter with you, you
.Â» retorted Smith.
The rest of the story is better told by
I Kelly, as he lay propped up in bed and
surrounded by his friends, who were
doing everything in their power to
make things easy for him.
"Now, you see, I don't take such sass
I from any one, I don't care how big they
I are. I come from around the bar, and
! as soon as I did I see he was a-goin'
j to cop me. Joe Qoddard stepped in be-
I tween and got a smash on the nose, but
! he's all right and I'll always remember
him for it. Then 1 made a grab for
Smith, so's he couldn't pull a gun, for
| I qÂ§e he was ugly and looking for
; trouble. The next thing 1 know I got
this one in the shoulder, but it'll be all
, right in a day or two. You don't catch
! me turning my toes to the daisies just
yet; I've got too many friends and
there's too much fun a-goin'.
"Some of the cops come up here
just now and wanted me to have him
arrested, but I can't see it in that
! light. Solly's a good fellow all right,
but he'd just had too much l.ooze and
: didn't want to be phut down on. I
i seen what vras the matter with him,
j and could have killed him after he
! stuck me even just with the one arm,
i but I didn't want to hurt him then.
I There'll be plenty of time for that after
j awhile if he's lookir. for trouble, and
1 that's all there is t it.
"Say boys," as a ouple of more well
known sporting characters entered
the room, "its almost worth a fellow's
while to get hurt, just to see how many
friends he's got. Why they have been
piling up here all night, and I've got
j enough volunteer nurses to start a
hospital with."
Spider was taken upstairs to his
room immediately after the row, and a
doctor was called in who sewed up his
shoulder and bandaged Joe's damaged
olfactory organ till his face looked like
a football mask. Kelly positively re
fuses to have his assailant arrested,
and wishes to have the affair > ushed
up as much as possible.
GUARD INSPECTION.
Company I of the First Infantry to
Go Through the Ordeal.
The first of the Inspections of the Na
tional Guard in accordance with the re
cent orders of the division commander
was held last night in the regimental ar
mory at Page and Gough streets. It had
been arranged to inspect companies B
and I of the First Infantry, but owing to
the absence in the East of Captain Fil
mer of Company B, the inspection was
confined to Company I, Captain Richter,
only. The inspection was by Major Jan
sen, brigade Inspector, and he was ac
companied by Captain Carrington, U. S.
A., detailed to inspect the National Guard
of California. Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce
and Captain Kelleher, adjutant of the
First Infantry, were also present. The
roll called for sixty-eight men, and all
but one responded at roll call. The men
in service uniform presented a fine ap
pearance. After the Inspection, the men
were drilled by the captain, and then by
the lieutenants, and some of the sergeants
were called 'upon to show what they
knew about drilling squads. The drill
was in close order and in extended order,
which, considering the little time the men
give to that part of a soldier's duty, was
creditable.
The inspection will be continued during
the week.
OFF FOB, THE KLONDIKE.
Pugilist Carroll and His Family De
parted for the Gold Fields
Yesterday.
Jimmy Carroll, the lightweight pugilist,
who fought Champion Jack McAuliffe in
this city twice, ami who has been a pro
fessor of boxing of late years, sailed
yesterday on the steamer H mboldt for
the ROidnelds of Alaska with his wife and
two sons. Carroll is sanguine of making
a fortune in the newly discovered gold
fields.
Jim Jeffries, the heavy-weight pugilist,
who Is to meet iv-t<>r Jackson on Tuesday
week, was an interested spectator at the
Orpheum Theater last evening. Tom
Sharkey and his lady love were also in
attendance, but after the boxing act. in
which one actor gave an imitation of foul
fighting, Sharkey decided that it was
time to decamp, and he left, satisfied that
the sporting people of this city are not
in favor of rough-and-tumble fighting,
which is not in accordance with Queens
berry rules.
Jeffries is sanguine of whipping Peter
JackÃon. and if he should prove success
ful the Olympic Club will offer flattering
inducements for a match between the two
young Herculeses, viz.: Jeffries and
Sharkey.
Charged With Assault.
T. H. Perry, a painter, was arrested last
night on complaint of Robert Fisher, and
charged with assault with a deadly
weapon. Perry went home last night and
found a Mrs. Driver, .who had formerly
lodged with him, in trre house in com
pany of Fisher. Perry ordered them out,
and on their refusal to go drew a revol
ver. Fisher attempted to take the weapon
away from him and had his hand badly
lacerated. Perry was locked up in the
City Prison pending a hearing.
Railroad Commissioner Hinton.
W. M. Hlnton. the newly appointed
Railroad Commissioner, took the oaih of
office In Department 6 of the Superior
Court. The form, filled out and properly
attested, has been forwarded to the Sec

THE TALES OF TWO MISSIONARIES.
The arrival of Dr. and Mrs. Baldwin
from the Orient, he being secretary of
the Methodist missions in the United
States, has been looked forward
to for some time by the ministers and
lay people of that denomination.
Dr. Baldwin went to China to assist
in the celebration of the semi-centen
nial of the establishing of missions in
that country. He arrived in this city
Sunday morning and yesterday he
spoke before a large gathering of the
clergy in the Y. M. C. A. Auditorium.
In his address he referred to the po
litical position of China and said that
now there was talk of Russia getting
a slice of the north of the central val-
ley of that country. France was taking
as much as it could get. England was
after a slice in the southern part and
Germany was laying hands on all she
could. He stated that there was con
siderable danger in this state of af
fairs. He stated that there are three
nations identical and opposed to the
disintegration of China, and these
three are the United States of America,
WALLER'S
CONSCIENCE
HERTS HIM
Grand Jury Told Him
He Was Imposing
on the Public.
His Resolution on Text-
Books Will Now Soon
Be Withdrawn.
Pressing Influence Brought to
Bear on the School Di
rector's Ideas.
AND GALLAGHER BLUSHED
Slowly AnÃweved Many Questions
Regarding Letters, Lumber and
Appropriations.
School Director Waller has come to
j the conclusion that his resolution re
garding the introduction of new text
! books in the public schools is consider -
i ably at fault and might work a hard
' ship on the struggling public. It is not
determined whether or not it is his con
science hurting him, but it is now
known that the Grand Jury whispered
some rather unpleasant remarks into
i his ears last evening at a meeting
I which seemed to be held for the spe
cial benefit of School Directors who are
not in favor with the people. At any
rate he has promised to withdraw his
resolution at the next meeting of the
Directors and to henceforth be good in
more ways than one.
The Grand Jury called Waller in con
nection with Director Gallagher before
them for the purpose of receiving ex
planations. The examination was long
and thorough, and by the time the two
were released from the gaze of their ex
aminers they were sorry that they had
appeared in response to a rather de
manding call. Some good, however,
was accomplished, as with the with
drawal of the resolution submitted by
Director Waller the public can use its
hard-earned savings for other pressing
purposes.
Gallagher followed In his turn and
was kept on the rack for over an hour.
His looks were at fault if he did not
wish he was at home snugly tucked
away in bed. The questions he was
asked by the various members of the
Grand Jury were hard to get around,
and in the second place it is not alto
gether assuring to appear before a
body of such determined men when it
is known that they hold the law in
their hands. "Is it not a fact that you
have sent various letters to Mrs. Fow
ler asking her as a special favor to let
certain numerous applicants for cer
tificates to pass through without an ef
fort on their part?" was asked the ex
amined, and he meekly replied that he
did not deny it, but, however, the fin
ishing touches of the remarks were not
heard.
"Why is it that the School Depart
ment recently audited a bill for $600 to
favor Patrick Swift for lumber, and
why did a bill accompany the other de
mand calling for $248 for hauling the
lumber?" Before the question could
be answered a listening party offered
the uncalled for information that it was
possible that the lumber was hauled a
plank at a time, and although the jury
looked rather pleased no comment was
made on the answer; but Gallagher
stated in reply that he was not fa
miliar with that portion of the work
ings of the department, and neither
could he explain the workings of that
portion of the School Board which al
lowed twenty teachers to handle only
fifteen classes.
Mr. Gallagher was questioned con
cerning a number of appropriations, but
he was apparently vague on the subject
and stated that he was not in a posi
tion to be questioned or give answers
in that line as he was not chairman of
the Committee on Appropriations. He
then went on in rather a lengthy way
and explained that he had always been
opposed to Director Waller's methods.
and particularly to his resolution
which would, without doubt, work a
hardship on the public, but that he was
well pleased that Mr. Waller had de
cided upon withdrawal. He refrained
from mentioning the influence brought
to bear upon the Director's conscience.
In answer to the question put by one
of the members of the Grand Jury,
"Why are the salaries of the teachers
not paid regularly?" he replied that
there was not sufficient money in the
funds at their disposal, but that he had
received the assurance that within a
short while money would be plentiful
and the teachers would not then have
to teach in vain. The dose may be re
peated.
The Grand Jury will not meet on
Thursday next in honor of the celebra
tion of St. Patrick's Day and out of re
spect to one of their members, J. H.
O'Brien, who is one of the leaders in
the coming celebration.
NATIONAL BANKS EXEMPT.
The License Collector Gets an Opin-
ion From the City and County
Attorney.
City and County Attorney Creswell has
advised License Collector Bonnet that the
general license order of the Board of
Supervisors does not apply to national
banks, and that he cannot legally en
force the payment of licenses by such in
stitutions. The main arguments ad
vanced by Mr. Creswell are as follows:
"National banks are instruments em
ployed by the Government of the United
States in the execution of its powers, and
Congress has power not only to provide
for the incorporation of them but to
limit the power of the State in the taxa
tion of them. Until the act of Congress
of June 3, 1864, the power of taxation of
national banks was denied to the States.
The forty-first section of this act "sub
jects theshares of national banks in the
hands of shareholders to taxation by the
States under certain limitations set forth'
therein. A taxation in any other way is
unconstitutional. The license tax pro
vided for by order No. 1589 is not a tax
on the shares of a national bank in the
hands of shareholders, but is a tax on the
occupation or the privilege of conducting
the business of a national bank. "The ex
action of a license tax as a condition of
doing any partiqular business is a tax on
the occupation and a tax on the occupa
tion of doing a business is surely a tax
on the business.' A municipality derives
its power of taxation from the State, and
if the State cannot impose a license tax
on national banks, a municipality can
not. The right of a national bank to con
duct its business is not dependent on a
licen.se granted either by the State or any
municipality thereof/
LOW AREAS THE CAUSE.
The Windstorms Due to Secondary
Areas in the Southwesc Quad
rant of Large Scope.
The strong winds of the last week, but
more especially of Saturday night and
yesterday, are the result of the disturbed
atmospheric conditions that have been
prevalent along the northern coast. Mr.
McAdie, the local weather forecaster, yes
terday Bald:
"The storms have been due to one or
two low areas coming along the northern
coast, a peculiar feature of which has
been their rapid prolongations to the
south, and as a consequence secondary
low areas have been formed from Oregon
down through Eastern California and
Western Nevada, and these have fought
their way east.
"On Saturday there was a sudden fall
of pressure in Eastern California and
Western Nevada, which was the result of
a southern prolongation of low area,
which gave us our own low area, causing
the southwesterly winds that changed to
northerly winds, which blew down the
valley on Sunday. Similar conditions ex
isted yesterday, only the low area extend
ed over a much larger territory, reaching
from the Pacific Coast to the Missouri
Valley. Secondary lows with westerly
squalls in the southwest quadrant of the
big low existed over California yesterday,
with the wind blowing at the rate of

England and Japan. The reason of
their opposition to this state of af
fairs was the freedom of the ports of
China, which affords the best field for
development in the whole world for
commerce.
"Such would not be the case," said
Dr. Baldwin, "if Russia had posses
sion. It is hardly necessary to say
why this state of affairs would be
when you look at the actions of Russia
in all the centuries of the past. It has
been the worst nation for the Protes
tant missions. In the dominions where
the English flag flics the Protestant
missions are sure of a foothold. There
fore it is better" that England take pos
session of China rattier than any other
country."
As regards the religious condition of
China he stated that he found it in
the most flourishing state and that
there were there 28,000 converts. He
said that the essential progress lies in
"securing" the womanhood of a coun
try, and the security of Christianity
lies also in raising the children in the
Christian idea.

which has been made good and paid.
The following report was read by Ex

examine Sheehan's accounts:
..â â¢ : - "I have made an examination of the
cashbook, vouchers and papers handed
me by you, from July, lSiÂ»ti, to January,
IS9S, and and: ' .
"Firstâ That all appropriations forward
ed to your late secretary anu treasurer
by the State Controller, as evidenced by
-OB uaeq aAuq "doyjo s'q uiojj s}Udmd;B}d
counted for and accredited to tneir re
spective funds.
"Second â That all moneys received
through the guardian of the valley, Miles
Wallace, for rents, privileges, sales, etc.,
as per his reports, and all moneys sent
direct' to or handed the secretary â  trom
renters or others, have been duly accred
ited, which is shown by the total amount
agreeing witn the total amount due from
such parties for u.e time indicated.
"Third â mat against these funds vouch
ers nave been issued and checks drawn,
and they are on file, with the exception
of the following, which have not yet
been presented: Voucher No. 100, in favor

"I further and â  that between the 18th

of December of the same year there was
received by the said secretary and treas
urer, John F. Sheehan, from the State

tain claims previously allowed by the
board; that the cashbook shows all such
claims to have been paid at various times
after the receipt of said money and before
the Ist day of January, 18i>o.
"As a matter of fact, however, such
claims were not paid until the latter part
of January, 1898, nor was money to pay
the -ame deposited in bank until -on and
after the 19th day of January. 1898, as

A communication from the American
Forestry Association was read before the
meeting, in which it accepts, the Invita
tion of the Yosemite Commission to hold
its summer -convention in the Yosemite
Valley, which will probably be held in
the latter part of July. /
.Upon the recommendation of the guar
dian of the valley, it was ordered that
some action-be taken toward removing
the unsightly buildings around the hotel.
Special railroad rates were granted by
General Passenger Agent Goodman of the
Southern Pacific to Native Sons and their
families, who will make the -iosemite
the Mecca of their summer vacations.
