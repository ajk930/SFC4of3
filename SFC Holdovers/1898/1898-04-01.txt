DTPLOMATS DECLARE
WAR IS IMMINENT
SPAIN YET
REFUSES TO
QUIT CUBA
Alleged Reply to an Ultimatum
Received From Minister
Woodford.
While the Madrid Government Is Pretending to
Make Reforms by Releasing Starving
Reconcentrados Hostilities
Grow Nearer.
NEW YORK, March 31 â â
The Herald's Washington cor
respondent telegraphs: After
waiting many hours for vord
from Madrid in reply to our rep
resentations, President Me Kinky
to-night received through the
State Department a long cable
message from General Wood
ford, Minister to Spain. This
message is not the final answer
of Spain to our proposition, but
its character is such that war is
still regar led to be inevitable.
President McKinley was ; waiting for
this message to-night, and invited a
large number of friends to remain and
learn any important news that , might
arrive. Assistant Secretaries -of State
Day and Adee. of the State Department,
were at hand ;to translate* ihe - . cipher
'-ode. . Among the President's^ call*
\vli c \lc Arthur, | Second Secretary
of the American legation at Madrid.
Vice-President Hobart and Senators Al
drich, Spooner, Allison and Hanna.
The party broke up at midnight, and
all were reticent. Three or four Sen
ators, however, admitted that the situa
tion was extremely serious, and that the
question now was whether the Senate
could be restrained from action in the
Cuban matter if there was any prolonged
delay in negotiating terms with Spain.
Senator Hanna, when asked if it was
peace or war, replied that he did not
know.
I learned late to-night thaAthe mes
gage from General Woodford, which is
a very long one, was not entirely trans
lated, and that while it did not give
Spain's final reply to our .proposition,
contains the general opinion of Minister
Woodford on the whole situation gath
ered from talks he has had with mem
bers of the Cabinet as well as from
communications which have passed be
tween him and the Council.
Spain has not made a formal request
for morÂ«t time, but she is going to. Gen
eral Wondford's dispatch refers to the
Spanish contention that there can be no
cession of territory by the Spanish Gov
. ernment until the Cortes meets. This
was fully explained in the Herald's
Washington dispatches this morning,
and the fact that this request for delay
was coming was anticipated. The ques
tion as to the ability of the Spanish Gov
ernment -to act goes' further than this,
the point having been raised that the
Spanish Ministry could not grant inde
pendence to Cuba as demanded by
President McKinley without the action
of the Cortes. An hour after the Presi
dent's callers took their leave every ont
of them had been seen by the â  Herald
correspondent. Not one of them was
willing to give any definite news, but
the manner of each indicated that
it was highly unsatisfactory. They all
declared that the cablegram from Minis
ter Woodford left the situation un
changed.
A statement was semi-officially issued
to-day that Spain was expected to aake
a counter proposition to ours covering
the following points:
First â That Spain shall send the re
concentrados back to their homes and
supply them with the means of sustain
ing life until the normal conditions can
be restored.
Second â That there shall be i.i ar
mistice between Spain and Cuba with
the end in view of securing a settlement
of the difficulties and the withdrawal of
the Spanish forces from Cuba.
Third â That in case of the failure of
the Cubans and the Spaniards to come
to an understanding during the armis
tice Spain shall submit the entire mat
ter to President McKinley as arbitrator
with the understanding that he will de
cide in that event for the entire indepen
dence of Cuba.
There is reason for believing that
these points in reality cover the sub
stance of the proposition of the United
States to Spain. The first of these
propositions has been anticipated by
Spain. The reconcentrados have been
ordered released. The second is mani
festly impossible, because the insurgents
The San Francisco Call
will not agree to an armistice. The
third commits Spain at the outset to
the independence of Cuba and the re
moval of the Spanish flag from the
island. It was probably in reply to an
inquiry from Spain about the third
proposition, "whether the independence
of Cuba was requisite?" that the answer
"Yes" was sent yesterday.
Senor Polo y Bernabe stated officially
in conversation to-day that he did not
believe Spain would consent to our de
mands. Representatives of all foreign
Governments here cabled their home
office to-day that the outlook was far
more serious than at any time during
the pendency 01 the Cuban question.
Most ominous was the statement
made by the President to the. Congres
sional committee late this afternoon.
He said that Spain had been informed
that Congress would not consent to
anything short of the absolute indepen
dence of Ci.!^ Two â â tbttlirp-ehcies
might arise. Esther Spain would reject
the proposition iof the United States, in
which case he would immediately com
municate with Congress or Spain might
ask for further delay and modifications,
in which event he would want twentv
four hours' further time to break off
diplomatic negotiations.
There has been much more of the
warlike talk than ever. It is all over
Washington, and it comes from conser
vative sources. The suggestion is
thrown out: that men in close touch with
the President are talking in this manner
for moral effect on Spain. While Spain
is hesitating it would be wise to let her
know just how serious the situation is.
The effect of Secretary Gage's predic
tion and General Grosvenor's outburst,
when cabled to Madrid, would be to
show Spain the fall responsibility she
may take. In other words, to convince
her that the Government of this country
is not trifling and that the independence
of Cuba must be assured or we will pro
ceed with armed intervention. The
speech of Grosvenor was exactly in line
with what the President to-day told the
committee of eleven appointed by the
Republicans, in the House who favor
armed intervention to expel Spain from
Cuba. The President is most persuasive
and convincing. He persuaded the com
mittee to report to the caucus that all
action ought to be deferred until Mon
day, and he convinced it that measures
would be taken on Monday to secure
the results they were aiming at if they
had not been by that time conceded by
Spain. So the committee went away
satisfied and the caucus decided not to
fire the train of gunpowder until Mon
day.
Into the situation at any time may ap
pear proffered mediation of other pow
ers. The Herald on Wednesday pointed
ou t that France stood ready to use her
goo<j offices. She still does, but an in
vitation must co^e either from the
United States, Spain or Cuba. The
statement that her mediation had been
tendered unofficially is tommy rot.
Germany, Great Britain and Austria
also stand in the same attitude. The
United States will not accept the media
tion of any foreign power, but it is ex
pected that Spain may soon "ask France
to give an opinion as to what should be
done with Cuba In that event Spain
might be willing to do on the suggestion
of France what she will not do under
stress of our demands. It is believed
here that at the critical minute when re
lations between the countries have
reached a cracking point several Euro
pean powers v. ill urge Spain to make
further concessions.
It was said at one of the European
embassies to-day that our requests of
Spain were such that she could not ac
cept them unless middle ground is
found. Spain, in the opinion of foreign
diplomats, must fight. In proof that she
expects to fight these diplomats point
to her massing her fleet in the direction
of Cuba, and the letter of the Queen
Kegent appealing to other European
sovereigns for sympathy, and the sud
den change of policy in Cuba. This

View of the City and Harbor of St. Thomas, Danish West Indies, Looking From the Heights on the ' North
of the Town Out South tor the Open Sea.
WASHINGTON, March 31.â The Com
mittee on Foreign Relations this after
noon reported to the Senate a bill for
the purchase of a nava! station in the
West Indies. It appropriates $5,000. 00rt
ard authorises riego'u ation for 'the
Danish Islands, St. Croix, St. Thomas
and St. John, or any one of them. While
the United States Government does not
want to purchase all the West Indian
Islands owned by Denmark, It is prob
abe that the sale of St. Thomas,
the most desirable and only one of the
group desired by this country, will not
be made unless the others are included.
WILL PRESENT
A BIG BATTLESHIP
How William X, Vanderbilt Will
Aid the United States in
the Event of War.
NEW YORK, March 31.â William K.
Vanderbilt, it was reported to-day has
decided in the event of war with Spain
to present to the United States Gov
ernment a warship to cost $5,000,000.
This interesting Information came
from a most responsible source, with
the explanation that Mr. Vanderbilt,
impressed with the justice of the na
tion's attitude in the present crisis, be
lieved this to be the most direct and
practical manner in which he could be
of service to his country.
Mr. Vanderbilt, if his decision is as
reported, is following in the footsteps
of his grandfather, Commodore Cor
nelius Vanderbilt, who during the civil
war presented to the Federal Govern
ment the large ship Vanderbilt, which
was valued at $1,000,000. When Com
modore Vanderbilt placed the Vander
bilt at the disposal of President Lin
coln, the best vessel in his extensive
fleet of sidewheel steamships was con
verted into a cruiser, and did highly
valuable work during the war.
When the vessel became the property
of the Government all her upper works
were cut away and she was armed with
a battery of twelve 9-lnch Dahlgren
puns, six on each side, and two 100
pound Parrott guns, one each fore and
aft. Her hull was also made solid for
fifty feet from bow to fit her for use
as a ram. For some time after equip
ment as a war vessel the Vanderbilt
was employed in watching for the Mer
rimac. She later went in pursuit of the
Alabama, but never found her, al
though if she had, Captain Semmes of
the Alabama has since declared, her
superior speed and armament would
have decided the battle In her favor.
She afterward was employed to con
voy monitors to the Pacific Coast, and
after the war she became the receiving
ship in Mare Island Navy-yard. She
was sold by the Government in San
Francisco in 1872 and became the fa
mous sailing ship Three Brothers.

NAVAL MILITIA
ON WAR FOOTING
Steps Taken by the Navy Depart
ment to Increase the Strength
of the Reserve.
NEW YORK, Mar h 31.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Meas
ures were inaugurated by the Navy
Department to-day to place the naval
militia of the country on a war footing.
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt sent let
ters to the Governors of various States
having naval organizations, urging
that they recruit them up to their
greatest possible strength. In addition
they were requested to inform the de
partment at the earliest possible mo
ment of the number of yachts and tugs
available for use as scouts to be
manned by the naval militia organiza
tions.
Returns received by the department
show that the total organized strength
of the naval militia is 4445, and it is
believed it will not be difficult to In
crease this number to 10,000 officers and
men. It is proposed by the depart
ment to utilize the naval militia to as
sist regular vessels to defend certain
places on our coast that have no great
commercial importance and conse
quently do not enter into the scheme
of coast defense by the War Depart
ment, though they would be of vital
importance to the fleet In time of war.
To put these places in a state of de
fense requires mines to be laid, masked
batteries to be constructed and
manned, men to defend the mines and^
a floating force to assist in the de
fense. The naval militia will detail a
certain number of their force to con
struct, officer and man batteries for
the protection of the mine fields at na
val bases. __
GENERAL SCHOFIELD
TAKES FORMAL CHARGE.
Placed in Command of the National
Volunteer Reserve of the
United States.
NEW YORK, March 31.â General
John M. Schofield to-day took formal
charge of the National Volunteer Re
serve, and plans for speedily obtaining
an available standing army of 1,000,000
were made at a meeting of the military
committee.
Among those who met General Scho
field to-day were Generals Grenville M.
Dodge, Alex McD. McCook and Martin
T. McMahon.
General Schofleld suggested that
Congress at once be asked to put the
new organization on a permanent offi
cial basis, and this work will be under
Ed as too high.
Its value from a commercial view
alone has largely increased since that
time and this port is now ' the ren
dezvons and mail center for aH th*Â» in
sular iines of steamers, as wi v r.s those
plying to South and Central America.
The outbound mails are gathered and
dispatched from here, and incoming
ones distributed to their various des
tinations. It is in fact the distributing
point for mail and express for the whole
West Indies and the neighboring coasts
of South and Central America.

FLYING SQUADRON IN
READINESS TO SAIL
Heavy Pressure of Steam Kept Up on
the Brooklyn and Massa
chusetts.
NEW YORK, March 31.â A Newport
News (Va.) special to the Herald says:
Commodore Schley, commander of the
flying squadron, received orders from
the Navy Department this afternoon to
have his fleet ready to sail at a mo
ment's notice. Since receiving the order
heavy pressure of steam has been kept
up on the cruiser Brooklyn and the bat
tle-ship Massachusetts, which are an
chored in the harbor here, and they
are ready to weigh anchor at any time.
The order was communicated to the
commander of the Columbia, which is
lying at Old Fo-int Comfort.
The battle-ship Massachusetts is in
capable of making her maximum speed
of 17.5 knots an hour. Her bottom is
covered with sea growth. A diver who
was sent down to make an investiga
tion says the ship should go to the dry
dock, as her bottom is literally covered,
but owing to the strained relations be
tween the United States and Spai this
cannot be done. This heavy growth is
suposed to have been taken on while
the ship was at Dry Tortugas on the
southern cruise with the North Atlan
tic squadron.
Several divers went down to-night to
scarpe the bottom of the vessel and
work will be continued until the ship
is made seaworthy. Otherwise the Mas
sachusetts is in splendid condition and
is capable of going up against the most
powerful battle-ships in the world.
The cruiser Columbia is short of men,
lacking about .eighty to complete her
complement, and I understand the ne
cessary quota will be enlisted here.
The ship has on board the most deadly
supply of ammunition ever placed in a
cruiser.
As yet there are only three of the
ships composing the squadron in these
waters. The Minneapolis, the fastest
cruiser in the navy, is expected to ar
rive here not later than Saturday night.
She is now at League Island. The Texas
will join the fleet as soon as she leaves
the Brooklyn navy-yard.

OTHER BUILDINGS INJURED
The Temblor Also Felt on the Main
land, and a Catholio Churoh
at Vallejo Suffers.
Special Dispatch to The Can.
VALLEJO March 31.â There ie
another holiday in sight for a
great number of the men on the
navy-yard at Mare Island, for It
is a problem how long it will
take for the island to recover
from the shaking up It received
last night.
Estimates of the damage vary,
and it will not be until the nu
merous boards appointed and to
be appointed shall report that
anything like even an approxi
mate estimate can be made. At
present it is believed the damage
can be repaired for $500,000, but
that will be only the rebuilding
of what has been badly damaged
or destroyed. Some of the
buildings show no outward ef
fects of the shock, but shafting
has been twisted, corners sprung,
and it may be that all but two of
these buildings will have to be
rebuilt before last night's earth
quake shall have ceased to leave
its mark. Should the buildings
have to be rebuilt. $2,000,000 will
not represent the damage.
The shock seemed to be heavier on
the island than on the mainland, and
where the seismic force wrought its
greatest harm was at the Navy Hos
pital, a massive building of brick,
standing on the north slope of a hill
on the southern end of the island.
Originally the building cost $175,
000. It was built in the most
solid manner, and the thickness of its
walls can be measured in feet. It has
stood twenty-nine years, but last
night's shake has split it in a hundred
different directions, and daylight niters
through some of the rents in its walls.
There were two water tanks, one in
each of the towers, beside the main en
trance, and both of these were filled
each with eight tons of water when the
building began to rock. The walls
rumbled and lurched from side to side,
throwing some of the patients from
their beds to the floor, rousing all the
inmates and driving them half-dressed
out to the lawn in front of the build
ing. There were fifty patients, besides
the attendants, but all escaped unin
jured.
A board will investigate and report
on the building to-morrow. The re
port will probably recommend that the
building be torn down. Both towers
are twisted fourteen inches out of
plumb, and cracks run up the front
walls from the foundation to the eaveÃ.
A partition wall four feet thick is
cracked from basement to attic, the
granite lintel over the main entrance is
bent down several inches and a bis
crack runs through it and on up
through the bricks to the roof above,
the arches in the hallways are split
and seamed, corners of rooms are
cracked from floor to ceiling and the
whole building is like a house of cards;
massive as it is, it seems as if a strong
wind would tumble it in ruins. The
patients and attendants will be moved
at once.
The sawmill, where the shock <played
its most spectacular freak, is a con
fused heap of bricks and rafters. There
was $100,000 worth of machinery in the
building and it will cost almost its
value to save any of it. There was
also a lot of work under way, and this,
too, will be lost. The building was
not strongly built, and it was on made
ground â two facts which seem to have
materially contributed to its complete
destruction On the upper story was
where the plans of ships were laid out,
and some valuable instruments were
destroyed.
Some estimates make the sawmill loss
$150,000, but others place it at not more
than $100,000. Beside the sawmill was
a little paint storehouse, and It is now
a liberal education in the mixing of
colors. Paints are strewn in every di
rection and walls and roof and floor
ing are mixed in an indiscriminate
mass.
Next to the hospital and the sawmill .
the most extensive \, damage apparent â 
Is to the big brick chimney of ; the con
struction , and . repair department. It Is
over 100 feet high : and j nearly 3 feet
square at the base, and $10,000 will
hardly build another, but it seems as'
if that will ; have to be done, for the
shaft is . cracked clean around about
sixty - : feet . from its base, â  and up '. ana
down the sides the cracks run in some
places for at least twenty feet.
There is another big chimney in the
steam engineering department, but .it
escaped injury. It (was different with
the brick buildi..gs on either side, how
ever. One is a foundry and the end is
thrown ; clean out ; and the roof is
'â  - - % "2
â¢wrenched and the end foundation
cracked.
The other building was amachine shop,
and there would have been no more
harm done had the same thing hap
pened to it. he er<3 of the machine
shop is in place, but it \- f ttled and
cracked and if it stands i.. . to-mor
row it will be a disappointment. Both
buildings stood on t" c water's edge on
made ground and their end foundations
Bimply tilted outward, and in one case
dumped the whole end. which fell into
the tules.
The general storekeeper's buildings
are In bad condition. Both have bulged
out at the ends, and the main building
has dumped a few tons of bricks from
under the gable onto the ground below.
The other end is protected by ropes, for
it is expected to fall at any time, the
most serious damage being shown on
the inside.
In the other shop buildings there is
Wpt much damage apparent, but shaft
ing has been bent and machinery has
been displaced and i any of the work
men declare, they will not go back to
them when the - achinery Starts.
The officers' quarters were stripped of
their firewalls, and in some instances a
good part of the end walls have gone
with them, Inere is plenty of splin
tered glass and many a headless statue
and shattered mirror, but that was no
more than happened in the hospital and
all over Vail jo.
There were no men put to work this
morning, but at 1 o'clock work was re
sumed on the ships. No one has worked
in the shops, however, nor will any one
be put to work until it is a certainty
that the shop buildings can stand the
strain of the machinery in motion. It
is not known how long this will hold
back the work, but it will probably be
Monday, any way, before anything like
the former activity will be seen at the
yard. This will interfere naturally with
work on the Charleston, but the yard
people are only too glad she escaped
uninjured.
Divers were down outside the dock
this morning, but they found nothing I
serious. It was expected that the crui- i
ser had shifted a little, but a little I
wedging of the shores put her straight
again. Just up the seawall a crack
'was discovered In the granite and all
up the quay a crevasse runs between
the earth and the stone coping, but the
damage done is immaterial.
The electric light plant has been re
paired sufficiently to supply the lights
in the houses and along the roads, but
it will be some days before the shops
can be lighted again. The water main
to the island is also out of use for the
time being, but there is plenty of water
over there, and the main will be fixed
before the supply runs out.
About the liveliest thing in the earth
quake was the old ship Independence.
"She tried to turn a handspring,"
was the most graphic description one
old tar could give. She must have i
raised several feet on a wave, and then j
she pounded back into her bed in the
mud in a way to bring the raw recruits !
and even the old tars out of their ham
mocks and upon the deck with a run.
She was not much damaged, however,
except as tw furniture and, fittings.
. Already a requisition for brick work
ers has gone in from the hospital, but
they are wanted to tear down, not
build up. The other departments have
also sent in similar requisitions. |
The board of investigation has fin
ished but half of its labors and it will
be some days before the cost of repair
ing the damage can be figured up.
; In the town of Vallejo the most se
rious damage done was to St. Vincent's
Catholic Church. It is a brick build
ing set high on a hill, and has been a
prominent landmark in Vallejo. It may
have to be rebuilt, for its towers are
wrenched and twisted from base, to
battlement, and the walls are very
shaky. At least $5000 will be needed to
put it in condition again.

INCIDENTS OF THE SHOCKS
ASHORE AND AT SEA.
Human Beings Not the Only Ones to
Fear the Temblor, for Animals
at the Zoo Are Affected.
Every one in ?an Francisco talked
about the earthquake yesterday.
Laughable were some of the incidents
of the shocks, which seem to have
caused more merriment than 'mage
In this city.
W. E. Lacombe is nursing a severe
cut on his right wrist and a bundle of
badly shattered nerves. Mr. Lacombe
was in the office of the New "Washing
ton Hotel at Fourth and Harrison
streets when he felt the floor rise up
BUILDINGS AT THE MARE ISLAND NAVY-YARD DAMAGED BY
THE EARTHQUAKE.
and kick him just below where his sus- I
penders cross. Mr. Lacombe is not !
afraid of any man living, but he draws
the line at floors, so without waiting
for an apology he started to make his
exit through the swinging doors. He |
says now that the doors were wide |
open whan he started for them, but the
earthquake closed and locked them.
That did not deter Mr. Lacombe, how
ever, so he took a header through the j
glass, unmindful of the brass rods that
barred the panes. He only got part i
through and after the trouble was over j
friends rescued him and called for the
ambulance to take him to the Receiv
ing Hospital
Manager Kirknatrick of the Palace
Hotel draws the line at earthquake
promenades. He says he Is willing his
guests shall have all the diversion they j
choose, but these earthquake hops i
don't go any more at his place. He I
doesn't object particularly because of
the litter it makes in the hallways, or
the mixing up of bedding, stockings
and other wearing apparel, but he says
the participants become altogether too '
animated, followed by extreme agita
tion and unseemly inquiries regarding
the departure of the first east bound
train. The 250 guests whose homes are
beyond the Rockies held one of these
promenades Wednesday night, and be
came so demonstrative that it required
the entire force of clerks and bell boys
to allay the enthusiasm. After they
had quieted down a bit, Manager Kirk
patrick suught to reason with them,
but they scorned his arguments. Hon
eyed words didn't count with them.
They wanted a safe place to dress in
and a chance to emigrate.
It has often been asserted that ani
mals can tell in advance that an earth
| quake is du~ and is going to arrive on
! time. The inmates of the Zoo, at the
| Chutes, proved this assertion beyond a
doubt. Jolly, the big elephant, was
the first to get the message and he im
parted the information to the others
without loss of time. The animals are
usually fed at 11 o'clock and immedi
ately after the place is locked up and
left in care of two keepers. Wednes
day night some extra work was being
done around the place and twelve men
were on duty. The animals were all
asleep, when suddenly Jolly set up a
terrific trumpeting and plunged so fur
iously as to break the chain by which
he was fastened to a Btake. All the
other beasts took up the refrain, in the
midst of which the temblor made its
entrance. It was fortunate that so
large a force of men were in the Zoo,
for the animals were with difficulty
subdued. Jolly sounded the first warn
ing fully two minutes before the shock.
No damage was done and none of the
] animals broke loose but Jolly.
Deputy Coroner Jack Terrell was one
I of the most frightened men in town,
and he frankly admitted it. "Why,
i when I felt that shock," he said, "I
rolled out of bed and dropping on my
knees started to repeat the Lord's
prayer, but to save me I couldn't get
beyond 'hallowed be thy name.' "
"Why couldn't you finish it?" asked
one of his associates.
"Because I had forgotten the
prayer."
Deputies Hallett and Mclnnes were
asleep on the third floor of the Morgue
building and were jolted out of bed by
the shock. Both saw several sharp
flashes of lightning and each took a
solemn oath right there never to touch
another drop.
Mr. Hinckle was aaleep over his gro
cery store at the corner of McAllister
and Franklin streets, when he heard a
great crashing of bottles and glasses in
his store. Thinking that burglars were
at work, he telephoned for the police.
Some remarkable pranks were played
among the glassware on the shelves
and tables in Dieffenbacher's store at
31S Front street. On one table not an
j article was broken, while the contents
iof the next were a wreck. A few dishes
| would be shaken off on a stand, leav
ing the others in place. The shock
never disturbed a tier of four high cake
Wishes set one upon the other, though
other dishes on the same shelf were de
molished.
The Concord) a Club, corner of Van
Ness avenue and Post street, sustained
as much damage as any building in
town. Three of the tall chimneys are
in such a state that they have to be
tied with ropes to keep. them from fall
ing into the, street. The worst damage
is on the cornice above the main en
trance. The heipy granite blocks have
been wrenched from their beds and are
sprung far apart, while the heavy
chimney that rested on them has been
twisted nearly at right angles from its
original position. The interior of the
building has also sustained some dam
age.
Odd Feilo-K-R' Hall did not escape un
scathed, while a number of other prom-
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, FR 1, 1898.
inent buildings were more or less dam
aged. The Claus Spreckels building
was not injured in the least. The first
thought of nine out of every ten per
sons was how the tall building stood
the shock, and many were the expres- i
sions of admiration and gratification i
that the mammoth structure had es- |
caped unscathed.
The shake caused considerable dam
age to the dome of the City Hall, at a [
1 point about 100 feet from the ground,
where a large number of terra-cotta I
j plates forming the outer wall were !
shaken loose. A number of large
patches show whore the square pieces
of terra-eotta dropped out and a well- j
I defined crack extends about oile-third !
I the way around the dome. The wingless I
I angel remained intact. In the interior |
i of the hall no damage was done be
| yond the shaking down of a few pic
j tures and ornaments in the Mayor's
office, the flooring of a few hooks in the
libraries and the stopping of the clocks.
The crew of the ship Hufus E. Wood
had an experience while the earthquake
' lasted that they will not forget in a
hurry. The vessel at the time was in
the vicinity of Point Reyes, and the
second mate was in charge of the deck.
Without warning everything was
thrown aback. The vessel's Jieadway
was stopped and she shivered from
stem to stern as though she had come
in collision with a sunken rock. Cap
tain McLean and the watch below i
rushed on deck in their night clothes, '
thinking that the Wood had been run
down and might be sinking. At first j
the phenomenon could not be accounted j
for, and the general opinion was that
the ship had struck a sunken wreck. A !
search was made of the waters around j
the ship, but as nothing could be found
Captain McLean came to the conclu
sion that it was some submarine dis
turbance, and only learned that it was
an earthquake when the ship reached
port.
On board the pilot-boat America Cap
tain Jordan and the pilots who were
with him had almost a similar experi
ence. The schooner was cruising off the
Farallones when the concussion came,
and everybody on board came to the
conclusion that the powder works at
Pinole Point had blown up.
Chisf Engineer Hawley of the rev
enue cutter Hartley had a narrow es
cape. He was in the engine room at
the time and was knocked backward
into the machinery. Luckily the en- |
ginee had been stopped a few min
utes previously, so" he escaped with a
few bruises.
Heine Benges and Harry Johnson
had a rough and tumble experience at j
the Folsom street wharf. Heine was
going north on the cannery rhip St. j
Nicholas, and while waiting for some I
other members of the crew he w^nt to i
sleep In Johnson's boathouse. Harry j
also dozed off, .'md when the quake
came it rocked the two men as though j
they were at sea. Heine grumbled, "I i
don't want to get up; let me sleep,"
while Harry growled, "Leave me alone,
you." As the earthquake in
creased in severity they were both
rolled out on the fl~or, and each
thought he had been pulled out of his
bunk on purpose. A fight followed and
both of them were considerably bat
tered up before they discovered their
mistake.
Custom-hoiise Officer Rprague de
serted the barge office at Meiggs v.harf
in a hurry. The building, according to
him, was rocking like a ship in a gale,
so he did not wait to put on his clothes,
but ran bare-footed and bare-headed
out on the wharf. He spent nearly- all
day yesterday in picking slivers out of
his feet.
The force of the earthquake was con
centrated along the north shore of the
bay. from Vail ojo to Santa Rosa, as
shown by the derangement of the San
Francisco and North Pacific bridges.
The heavy steel draw over Petaluma
j Creek at T3lack Point, on the Sonoma
Valley branch, a 180-ton structure, was
lifted bodily one foot vertically and
two feet laterally, derailed from its
circular running" gear and rendered
useless. Passengers by this railroad
are now being ferried across the creek
in boats, and the bridge will not be in
working order again for a week. The
drawbridge across Sonoma Creek was
also thrown out of gear, but was re
paired by a gang of men yesterday
morning.
ANTICS OF THE TEMBLOR
OVER IN OAKLAND.
Scared Some People, Broke Several
Chimneys and Smashed a Few
Panes of Glass.
OAKLAND, March 31.â Oakland has
been comparing notes with itsel
to find out how it was affect
earthquake. The damage is v
and can be summed up very
consisting of a wrecked bi
broken chimneys and a few
cracked glass.
There was some excitemen
house of A. C. Henry, the
when a section of chimney fell
apartment below and seriousl:
ened a party of Eastern visitors who
were just retiring. The damage was
very slight. The water off the Oakland
mole was churned Into big seas, and
the yachts were severely tossed ahout
for several minutes. Large waves beat
against the rocking ferry houses but
did no damage.
Not the slightest derangement was
caused to the telephone and telegraph
wires, and the only memory Oakland
will have of the quake will be the enor- |
raous fright that seized everybody.
At the Chabot Observatory the seis
mic needle showed that the earth had
vibrated considerably and in a very
erratic manner. ,^ghe sum total of the
stiakes'shows th/Vt^y acted nearly i.j !
a circle, altho-jglr there was a little ;
more movement from east to west than
from north to south.
One of the freaks of the earthquake
was the starting of an old clock in a
residence on Twenty-sixth street. This
clock is more than 150 years old, and it
has been dumb for many years. A few
weeks ago the clock was renovated and
put in a condition in which it was ex
pected would be useful. All attempts
to set the pendulum going proved
fruitless, and it was condemned as
useless. Just before midnight the an
cient clock felt the earthquake and it
has been ticking ever since. At the
same time a clock that has been keep
ing excellent records was stopped by
the vibrations.
THE QUAKE AS FELT
IN CLASSIC BERKELEY.
Professor Leuschner's Seismograph
Shows the Vertical Vibrations
to Have Been Strongest.
BERKELEY. March 31.â Last night's
earthquake wis the heaviest ever re
corded in BerKfley, according to Pro
fessor Armin Leuschner of the De
partment of Astronomy at the uni
versity. Professor Leuschner makes
the following statement in regard to
the temblor:
"The duplex seismograph shows that
the vertical vibrations were strongest
and almost twice as strong as the
horizontal vibrations from north to
south and from east to west. The first
displacement was north. It then
turned west, and there were a series
of short tremors, principally south
west. The displacement next turn
ed ' southeast, and the maxi
mum up and down vihration followed.
"Then came a serif 1 * of small vibra
tions, at first southeast and later
northwest. A northeast movement fol
lowod, and was succeeded by one al
most twice as strong in a direction ex
actly opposite. Here an almost circu
lar vibration occurred, and then the
vibrations gradually died out in a
southwest direction."
CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE
DONE AT SONOMA.
SONOMA, March 31.â Sonoma was
visited last night at fifteen minutes to
12 o'clock by one of the most prolonged
and violent earthquake shocks ever
felt here. The vibrations were from
north to south. Accompanying the
shock was a rattle and noise that
caused the stoutest hearts to quail. The
first shock was followed at intervals by
four other temblors that were very
heavy and over twenty lesser ones that
caused windows to rattle and kept citi
zens in a constant state of alarm.
Considerable damage was done in
both town and valley by falling chim
neys, the cracking of brick and stone
walls of buildings, the breaking of win
dows and the wrecking of glassware.
| The front show windows in Clewes' store
were broken and the south side of the
large building Is seamed and cracked
to an alarming extent. The Sonoma
Valley Bank building is badly frac
tured and the vault seriously damaged.
I The chimney on the handsome resi
dence erf William McElroy fell with a
crash through the roof and ceiling of
the dining room and the floor was
strewn with brick, plaster and splin
ters of wood. The High School building
was badly cracked and seamed, but
1 not to such an extent as to make It
dangerous.
A strange thing happened on the
farm of Captain H. E. Boyes. The
water in the reservoir was lifted bodily
by the upheaval and cast to one side
as though the reservoir was a wash
bowl, leaving it dry.

The work incident to the transforma
tion of the yachts and tugs recently
purchased for the Navy Department so
as to make them practicable for naval
purposes is now well under way. The
alterations and changes necessary are
being rushed with all possible speed,
and orders have been issued to employ
a sufficient number of men to work
night and day so that no time will be
lost. In the tugs particularly there are
numerous changes necessary for the
comfort of the men who will man
them. The yachts, on the other hand,
are in better shape, and less work will
be required than on the tugs. They will
be given a belt of armor as a means of
protection for portions which are moat
vulnerable to the enemy's fire. So far
the department has purchased five
yachts and eight tugs for the auxiliary
navy.
Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British
Embassador, called on Assistant Sec
retary Roosevelt i â¢ the Navy Depart
ment this afternoon and left his card
for Captain Sigsbee, congratulating
that officer upon his escape and his
bearing throughout his recent thrilling
experiences in the harbor of Havana,
There was nothing especially signifi
cant in the movement of naval vessels
reported to the Navy Department to
day. The gunboat Wilmington arrived
at Jacksonville yesterday, on her way
to New York for repairs.
The torpedo-b .t Bomers, purchased
in Germany, arrived at Pillau yester
day on her way to the United States.
The gunboat Wheeling has left Port
Angeles for Seattle. The cruiser Co
lumbia and the revenue cutter Morrill
arrived at Norton to-day. The Co
lumbia is attached to the flying squad
ron, and is in ~ mplete readiness for
any service she may be called upon to
perform. Her sister ship, the Min
neapolis, now fitting out at League
Island, is expected to join the squad
ron at Hampton Roads in a day or
two.
The gunboat Marietta of tho Pacific
squadron arrived at Callao to-ciay. Al
though not so admitted, it is gener
ally understood that she is bound for
Key West. The same is true of the bat
tle-ship Oregon, which is expected to
arrive at Callao this week. These ves
sels have been informed of the presence
of the Spanish torpedo boat Temerario
on the east coasr. of South America, and
have been warned to be on their guard
against her while in thos a waters.
The military information division of
the War Department has made public
a table bearing on the strength of the
militia in the United States in 1897. It
also gives data as to the number of men
liable for military duty, information in
regard to appropriation, military offi
cers, encampments and mobilization.
The table is compiled from the reports
made to the department by army offi
cers detailed for duty with the militia
of the States. The authorized strength
of the military of the entire country
(which, however, Includes several
States where this strength is not lim
ited) is 186,848, while the aggregate ac
tual strength is 113, 7G0, made up as fol
lows: Infantry, 100,179; artillery, 5055;
cavalry, 4H78; special troops, 2^70; gen
erals and staff officers, 878; non-com
missioned staff officers. 400. "
The total number of men liable to
military duty in the country is 10,378,
118. State appropriations made for the
maintenance of militia in 1897 amount
ed to $2,723,564.

SANTA CRUZ, March 31.â Santa Cruz
was visited shortly before midnight last
night by the most violent earthquake

Gen. Grosvenor Speaks
of Administration's
Policy in Cuba.
Declares on the Floor of the
House That McKinley Does
Not Favor Any Scheme
of Purchase.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 81.
For three hours to-day the
packed galleries and excited
members of the House listened
to a passionate outburst of ora
tory on the ruban question, dur
ing which the intensity of feel-
Ing was alternately manifested
by cheers, jeers and hisses. Time
and again the excited throng * in
the galleries were admonished to
be silent, and once at least It
seemed as if a motion would be
made to clear them. The three
speeches which stirred the as
semblage to its depths were
made by General Grosvenor of
Ohio, who, it was assumed, spoke
for the administration, and who
practical ly pledged it n the
cause of free Cuba; Bailey, of
Texas, the Democratic Ie ider,
wh" announced the Democratic
position as for free Cuba, with
out war if it could be avoided,
but with war if necessary: and
Johnson of Indiana, who spoke
for peace, declaring that it was
our duty to go to the extreme
in magnanimity in order to
avoid the horrors of war. Lewis,
a Democrat from Washington,
provoked the speech of Johnson,
which aroused the members and
the galleries to the fever pitch
of excitement. Lewis had de
nounced the propositi n that
Cuba purchase her freedom from
Spain, which, it was all-ged, the
administration was f osti-rir.g.
Then it was that Johnson, in a
brilliant speech, pleaded for
peace. He faced the storm of
hisses which swept down upon
him from the galleries like a
Spartan, and, with jassionate
utterance, adjured members to
pause before .they plunged the
country into Var, the evils of
ow after : a end
less train, 'ihe Houss has be
fore had Illustrations of John
son's fearlessness, but none so
striking as to-day, when he es
poused the unpopular >ause and
pleaded to let diploma* y have its
way.
Immediately after the reading
of the journal the House went
into committee and proceeded
with the consideratirn of the
naval appropriation b.ll.
An exciting incident vas caused by
Lewta (D.) of Washington In unmeas
ured terms he denounced the adminis
tration, which rumor sail, was consid
ering a money indemnification for the
murder of the Maine's sailors.
Johnson (R.) of Indiar.a replied in a
heated speech. With withering sar
casm he declared that the true solution
of the problem of wiping the Spanish
nation off the map would be to har
ness up the gentleman from Washing
ton and turn him loose. But, serious
ly, he declared, he despised this cry of
A storm of hisses greeted this
Btatement, but, proceeding, he declared
that if Congress would restrain its zeal
and keep its hands off peace could be
; . ved.
Lewis replied to Johnson a few mo
ments later. He declared^hat if the
Indiana n spoke for the President on the
floor when his political epitaph was
written it would contain only the line,
.! uch Johnson."
Johnson responded in a speech that
pxi ited the most intern Interest, and
cheers, applause and hisses at different
tines greeted him. It was an eloquent
appeal for peace-. War and its hor
rors he pictured in bin. k colors,
ling upon the anguish of the widows
and the cries of the orphaqp K.ery
pi ssible expedient should be urg<-d and
resorted to before we should permit
ourseives to be driven into war. He
feared Congress was now driving the
President. If, as had been stated, an
ultimatum had been pent to Spain, he.
believed it meant war. Spanish pri<le
would not, he said, permit her to be
cd. He cared nothing for the hisses
or applause of the public. History would
"vindicate him.
Bailey, the Democratic leader, follow
ed Johnson and charged that the re
fusal of the Republicans to vote for the
freedom â¢ t the ''Ã¼bans was Intended bo
give the President a chance to compel
the island of ''Ã¼ba to buy her liberty
from the butchers of Spain. He de
clared that there was yet a chance to
avert war. Within forty-eight hours,
h<- said, a representative of the Cuban
republic had told him that Cuba did
not desire to involve the United States
in war. All she desired was recogni
tion, so that she could buy arms and
ammunition, and in a few months she
would l>e free. So eloquently did he de
scribe the horrors of war as they had
to the SMuthern people that "mem
bers on the floor and people In the gal
leries actually wept, and when, in con
clusion, he declared that his side was
for free Cuba without war, if possible,
but with war if necessary, the demon
stration from the galleries was over
whelming.
Grosvenor (R.) of. Ohio, whose utter
ances are given great weight, owing to
his close friendship with the adminis
tration, answered Bailey. Ho said he
did not intend to reply to the argu
ment of the gentleman from Texas, but
he felt for him a strong degree of sym
pathy.
"When." lv said, "a man has been
for nearly a yt ir trying to play a game
"f politics on the question of war and
has failed, and has finally mad.- an ex
hibition, a futile pffort 'in that direc
tion, unparalleled in th<- history of this
body, it becomes pathetic when he
talks nbout a war and a wsr that will
never happen. I rise to point out one
or two absurd statements constantly
repeated in the newspapers and which
I found an echo in the voice of the gen
tleman from Texas. He warns this side
that if the President attempts to force
, the Cubans to buy their freedom hell
i will break loose in about fifteen seconds
imi the Democratic side. (Laughter on
| Republican side.) Nobody promises to
: force <"Ã¼ba to buy her independence.
It iv {lice a tale told by the idiots, full
of sound and fury, and full of nothing.
j There is no such proposition by. to or
j from the administration, and the whole
idle prattle of this character in the
newspapers has been Just so much folly
and nonsense, and yet a statesman,
leader of a great division on this floor,
rise? and solemnly warns the Republi
can side of this house that if the Pres
ident drives Cuba to buy her inde -ifl.
ence they will go to work to prevent It.
Nobody has attempted it; it is an idle
dream of somebody and talk of the
newspapers. Again, what does the ger.
tleman know about how far matters
have progressed between the United
States as the intermediary source of di
plomacy and Spain and Cuba on the
other side? The gentleman from Texas
did say yesterday that he believed the
President Of the United States was try
ing to force it upon the Cubans and to
day he said he knew it. Now I rise
simply to say that the gentleman is
wholly mistaken. If he has such In
formation from an authoritative source
he ought to mnkÂ» it public. The time
has come In this country whon misun
derstanding of what is going on is do
ing more harm than the views of people
who do understand."
"Will the gentleman state." inter
posed Williams (D.) of Missouri, "that
he believes and knows that it is
not in contemplation by the President
in the negotiations now going on to
treat of a money consideration for the
freedom of Cuba?"
"It is too contemptible to answer.
Such a thought never entered into the
head of any man connected with the
administration."
"Is there not an Intimation of that
kind in the negotiations at Madrid?"
"What have we to do with the ne
gotiations at Madrid?" asked Grosve
nor. "I say the purchase of Cuba by
the Government or the suggestion of
its approval is a story told by an Idiot.
There never was anything in it, and
this is only done to fan anew the flame
that seeks for political advantage on
| this floor by springing so-called ques
j tions of privilege that make the author
of them ridiculous in the sight of com
mon humanity."
"Were the forty-five gentlemen who
met a few evenings ago and agreed to
vote for independence seeking political
advantage?" asked Lentz (D.) of Ohio.
"I heard something of that kind,"
replied Grosvenor, "but I heard some
thing better. Yesterday, when the
scheme to promote a political advan
tage was sprung here witn the awk
wardness of a Fourth of July boy burn
ing firecrackers, ITS gentlemen put their
Barnes on the right side of the organi
zation of a party and party concord.
No, in conclusion, the administration of
this Government to-day is as anxious
for freedom and independence of Cuba as
; any gentleman on the other side of the
House. There is not one man from the
President down to the humblest mem*
ber on this floor who will ever, with
out the consent of the Cuban insur
gents, ratify, agree to, or approve any
settlement of the Cuban question that
does not involve absolute independence
for Cuba. (Applause.) There is not a
gentleman on the other side of the
House who knows this better or from
a more direct source of information
than does the gentleman from Texas,
because he has had the fullest oppor
tunity to learn the fact and knows It
is unjust to the President to intimatb
; that he to-day knows that the Press
dent is trying to force Cuba to buy her
! independence."
After declaring that the administra- !
tion was in favor of avoiding war if it '
could possibly be done consistently with !
the honor, dignity and glory of the '
American country and after further
decrying war talk which was for po
litical purposes, Grosvenor said:
"Cuba will be free, and Cuba will/be
free by the intervention of the United !
States. I would not give one cent for j
a declaration of Independence unac- '
companied ,by a further declaration. j
What nonsense it would be to declare '
the island of Cuba independent, : and I
then let her starve to death! The thing
todo in the case of Cuba is to exhaust all
that honest diplomacy can do to achieve
her liberty and independence, and fail- j
ing in that, stop not at the half-way !
house that the gentleman from Texas I
is talking aboutâ not only, declare that
Cuba is independent, and. shall be free,
â  but accompany that declaration with
an army and a navy to make our dec
laration worth something. [Applause.]

ALLEN'S SENSATIONAL
SPEECH AS TO CUBA.
An Apparently Simple Request by
Frye Causes Bed Hot Talk in
ths Senate.
WASHINGTON, March 31.â An ap
parently simple request, made of
the Senate to-day by Frye of MaiÂ»e, in
I behalf of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee, unexpectedly precipitated a dis
cussion on the Cuban question. It fln
: ally led to a passage at arms between
' Chandler of New Hampshire and Frye,
in which the former made some sar
castic remarks as to the conduct of the
Foreign Relations Committee and the
attitude of the President. Allen of Ne
braska made the request of Frye the
occasion of a speech upon the gen
eral Cuban question, in the course of
which he reviewed his own record on
the subject and declared he stood now
just where he had always stoodâ in fa
vor of the absolute independence of the
Cuban people from that "hideous mon
ster among nations" â Spain.
Frye of Maine, who reported yester
day from the Committee on Foreign
Relations a resolution calling upon the
President for the Cuban consular re
ports, requested that the resolution lie
on the table until such time as the com
mittee shall call it up. The committee
was constantly engaged in work, and
there was reasons why the resolution
should not be considered in the absence
of the committee.
Chandler of New Hampshire objected
to making any such contract as sug
gested, and Frye then moved that the
resolution be recommitted to the For
eign Relations Committee. On that mo
tion Allen of Nebraska expressed his
desire to be heard.
Allen reviewed hia record upon the
; the Cuban question, saying that he and
former Senator Call of Florida were the
â¢. first members of the Senate to take a
S strong stand in favor of the independ
i ence of Cuba. Allen said if he could
! have his way he would support the
erection of a republic in Cuba with all
the land and naval forces of the United
i States and force the construction of an
! independent nation over the ashes of
j Spain's sovereignty on the island.
Allen read voluminous excerpts from
speeches which he had made during the
past two years to indicate that he had
i been constantly and consistently in fa
' vor of the independence of Cuba. He
said that he had never wavered in the
belief that Cuba would some time stand
forth in the grand galaxy of republics.
He maintained that the United States
; stood as an elder brother to Cuba, and
; unless we did our full duty toward her
we would be guilty of base cowardice.
The independence of Cuba must be
wrested from Spain â that hideous mon
â¢ ster among nations â so that the people
of that island should have the richt to
breathe the air of freedom. He held
| that the right of self-government was
i inalienable, and was as much the right
j of Cuba as of the people of the United
! States.
'"Twice in forty years have the Cu
bans struggled for their freedom," Al
len declared, "and now they stand in
sight of that goal, guided by the mas
ter, Gomez, who will, in his time, be re
garded as one of the greatest com
manders and revolutionists of this cen
tury. He will live in thousands of pa
triotic hearts so long as freedom shall
have an abiding place with good peo
ple."
Allen compared the career of Weyler
in Cuba with the conduct of the revo
lution in the Netherlands. There was
universal destruction, devastation and
death. This picture, vivid more than
imagination could paint it, had been
drawn for this Senate by Senators
Proctor, Ga! linger, Thurston and
Money. Weyler's policy was strongly
presented and his "brutalities and
atrocities" were sharply portrayed. He
dei tared that Weyler's rule in Cuba had
been "tempered with murder and mod
ified by assassination."
Referring to the catastrophe to Ihe
Maine, Allen said that Spain must be
made to pay for the wholesale murder
of American seamen.
"She must," said ' Senator Allen,
"compensate for that murder at least
by freeing Cuba, by furling her dirty
Hag and leaving the continent, never to
return. I am a jingo of jingots. 1 have
always fel*. that the Cubans would ul
timately be able to wrest their freedom
trwn Sp-ii.. Whatever may be done
about the Maine disaster, one thing
ought to be distinctly understood. It
should not be submitted to the arbitra
ment of a foreign power."
Allen said that this couAtry had no
greed for Spanish territory or for Span
ish gold, nor was it the desire of the
United States to establish a protector
ate over Cuba; but the torch which
was lighted in Cuba must be extin
guished. Further along Allen said:
"If I could have my way, I would in
stantly recall our Minister to Madrid
and hand to the Spanish Minister here
his passports."
He said that he was opposed to the
general policy of the President of the
United States, but as one of the rep
resentatives in the Senate of a great
State, he was willing to give him his
support in a proper solution of the Cu
ban problem, for he felt that all po
litical considerations at a time like this
ought to be laid aside and men of all
parties should stand together. He be
lieved in a few more days we should
witness Cuba's firg, consecrated by
hundreds of thousands of lives, wav
ing in triumph over the island.
Scarcely had Alien concluded when
Chandler of New Hampshire precipitat
ed a lively scene. He thought the ac
tion of the Committee on Foreign Re
lations indicated some doubt and inde
cision. Yesterday the committee thought
a new call for the consular reports
ought to be made; to-day it thought
the call ought to be withdrawn.
"The first call," said Chandler, "was
made in a resolution presented by the
Senator from Alabama (Morgan) on
February 14. On the following day, at
9:40 a. m., an answer to the call for in
formation came from Spain (a signifi
cant reference to the Maine disaster).
I have the fullest confidence in the
Committee on Foreign Relations. I have
confidence that the President intends
to pursue a patriotic and righteous
course in the present emergency, and
I shall thank God when he reaches a
conclusion of some sort or other. There
fore, I am not in rebellion as yet
against the powers that be. I await
upon the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions. I do not think that as that com
mittee deemed it advisable yesterday
to make a second call for the Consular
correspondence and has now reached
the conclusion that the second call
should be made, the committee ought
to give us some reason for the delay."
Frye then renewed his motion to re*
commit the motion to the committee.
"I shall not object," sharply respond
ed Chandler, "to letting the Committee
I on Foreign Relations having control of
the resolution â to letting the committee
start, turn back and then start again.
! I will help" the committee whenever I
; can."
The motion to recommit was passed.
Thereupon Chandler reintroduced, on
his own account, the committee's reso
lution and asked that it go over until
to-morrow. Frye gave notice that he
would move, when the resolution was
called up, to recommit it to the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations.

SPANIARDS
REPORT ON
STARVATION
General Blanco Declares
the Situation Is
Improved.
Admits the Good Work Done by
the United States and Does
Not Try to Underestimate
the Misery in Cuba.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 31.
The Spanish Legation has re
ceived a full report from Cap
tain-General Blanco, from the
Governors of all the provinces of
Cuba and from the Alcaldes and
Chiefs of Police of the principal
cities as to the condition of the
reconcentrados. It is an elabo
brate treatment of this subject
by the officers directly in charge,
and gives the situation fully
from their standpoint. It is note
worthy that they do not seek to
minimize the dreadful condition
of these people, but endeavor to
show that they are doing their
utmost to alleviate the misery
and misfortune which exists.
General Blanco's report Is In
substance as follows:
In the midst of the painful impression
caused by the situation of the reconcen
trados, it is some satisfaction to note the
great improvement in their condition as
compared with which it was four or five
months ago. In response to the keen in
terest which the home Government has
shown in the matter, this Government
has endeavored from the very first, in
every possible way, to alleviate so much
misery and misfortune. The cities, over
filled with men, women and children
without work, were unable to sustain a
popul.-uion of consumers who produced
nothing; the destruction of so many ham
lets by the insurgents compelled the un
fortunate inhabitants to seek refuge in
the towns to save their lives, the only
thing possible to be saved from this wan
ton and barbarous destruction, which
had reduced them to a state of the most
horrible wretchedness. In Puerto l'rin
cipe nearly all the reconcentrados were
of this class. The maladies originated by
this crowding together of human beings
and the fatal belief in an inevitable com
bined to take away from many the neces
sary energy to struggle for Lie, and to
discourage private charity, which consid
ered itself im'iotent. without a decided
help from official charity, other and
sadder consideration?, -y be i.ade to
explain, a certain fc-arsive resistance
among some elements which regarded
every rcconeentnulo as an enemy more or
less disguised; the result of all this was
the truly formidable problem presented,
all the graver from the fact that it was
,i necessity of immediate urgency.
The disposition of this Government was
to attack the eVfl at its source. By the
decree of November 14 last the return
Of all the reconcentrados to their homes
was permitted, and they wero authorized
a: the same time to curry arms to defend
their property. In this the cities were
relieved of a large part of their abnormal
population, and a check given to the dis
eases produced by overcrowding. Com
mittees of help were organized, interven
tion in them being given to the clergy,
doctors and all the more respectable ele
ments. Official charity, a few days after
the establishment of these juntas," provid
ed them with resources for handling over
$100,000 the 23d of November, and $50 UOO
the second of March. The governors and
alcaldes were called upon lo snow their
zeal by giving a good example, an appeal
to which these authorities responded with
an interest worthy of all praise. In this
way was private charity encouraged and
enabled to organize its own protective
committees, economic kitehen3 and char
itable associations which distribute relief
personally and contribute powerfully to
relieve the suffering.
As a result of all this public spirit be
gan to rise agrain, confidence returned,
and a disposition to work began to pre
vail. In Santa Clara there are actually
a large number of these unhappy beings
occupied in the field of labor. In order
to avoid the overcrowding which ws
found to occur when the laborers re
turned to the towns after the day's work
huts were erected for them in the culti
vated zone, with very excellent results
In Tlnar del Rio five Villages are being
reconstructed, and effective means are be
ing taken to increase and encourage ae
ericukural labor. In Santiago de Cuba
the cultivated zones are in perfect con
dition. Those in San Luis, Sango and
Canery may be termed as models. In
Matanzas 10.000 free railway tickets were
given to the reconcentrados who returned
to their old homes. Gradually the grivitv
of the crisis is passing away, "but owln- to
the height it attained this cannot be ac
complisned in a brief time.
Apart from any preconceived idea It is
only Just, to admit that the help which
comes from the United States is also a
powerful means of relief in the actual
wants. The Governor of this province
(Havana) calculates at $40,000 the value
of the provisions, clothes, medicines etc
distributed in this city during the month
of February, which have contributed to
the relief of the excessive number of re
concentrados here. It is sad to note that
the population has diminished, but it
must be remembered that this is by no
means due exclusively to want and 'mis
ery. The emigration which occurred in
some cities was enormous; in Santiago
de Cuba alone 12,000 passports have been
signed. The official statistics also show
that the high rates of mortality are not
due in many cases to the absence of pro
visions. It has been observed that the
largest number of deaths occur upon the
arrival from the country of new groups
of reconcentrados who, unwilling to take
the advice of the doctors, in their debili
tated state eat the "rancho" that the
thoughtless charity of the soldiers makes
them proffer, in many with fatal
results.
I will say in conclusion that the situa
tion has improved much and that the
most active point of the crisis has passed.
The problem, however, is not yet solved,
nor can this be done immediately, be
cause the majority of the persons de
pendent on public charity at the moment
are children and women whose future has
to be assured. A state of war invariably
leaves deep scars and much work and
time are necessary to repair the damage
done in a single day.
Accompanying the report of General
Elanco are reports from the governor
of Matanzas Province, Francisco d'Ar
mas; the governor of Santa Clara
Province, Marcus Garcia; and from
the governors of Havana and Pinar del
Rio. The p-overnors give the technical
condition of the reconcentrados in the
several provincas, the expenditure of
funds and the establishment of relief
kitchens, etc. Governor d '-mas says
the havoc began when the fertile fields
of Matanzas were invaded by the in
surgents, in 18D5, desolating the land and
leaving the people out of work. He ad
mits that the reconcentrado decree of
1896, instead of diminishing the evils,
augmented them. Governor Garcia of
Santa Clara gives the particulars o!
the relief measures adopted. The Gov
ernor of Pinax del Rio gives a ll*t at
reconcentrados In the villages of his
province to whom rations are issued.
He states the number of these recon
centrados to be 15,686, of whom 5475 are
over 14 years of age. The suffering is
as intense in this province as in others,
â  except where people have secured and
have been allowed to carry their rifles.
The chief of police of Matanzas says
the situation has improved noticeably
since the reconcentrados are securing
work. The worst feature of the situa
tion seems to be that while the men
are relieved by getting work, the wo
men and children are still a charge on
the community. The suffering is
; greatest in this class, and the efforts
toward relief are mainly directed to the
women and children.
DIPLOMATS DECLARE
WAR IS IMMINENT
Continued from First Pagra.
change of policy is regarded as most im
portant.
The proclamation of General Blanco
restoring reconcentrados to freedom is
a central fact. It is true that Spain has
\ issued other edicts abating the rigors of
confinement of these helpless creatures,
but suffering and want have continued.
Although the rigors were officially
abated, deaths from starvation in these
' fortified towns increased. The release
lof these reconcentrados so that they
! could go back to their farms and work
I was one of the things requested by
I President McKinley in his correspond
! ence with Spain. Congress has been
thundering for it for months. Spain has
either yielded this point in correspond
j ence that has been had so far or else is
; acting independently of us. She has
certainly acted with great haste. The
fact that a credit of 3,000,000 pesetas has
! been voted to General Blanco for re
1 lief work, the money to be applied to
; food, agricultural implements, etc., has
j a look that is ominous. Spain may be
j getting ready to co-operate with us in
I relief or she may be preparing to say
j to Europe that she is able to care for
i the sufferers in Cuba and that the
I United States relief is not needed there.
Time for Intervention.
LINCOLN, Neb., March 31.â Hon.
William J. Bryan to-night made the
first statement for the Associated
Press in answer to the question wheth
er, in his judgment, the time had ar
rived for the "nited States to inter
vene in behalf of Cuba and bring the
war to an end. He said: "Yes, the
time for intervention has arrived. Hu
manity demands that we shall act.
Cuba lies almost within sight of our
shores and the sufferings of her
cannot be ignored unless we, as a na
tion, have become so engrossed in
money making as to be indifferent to
distress."
Chile to Sell No Warships.
LIMA, Peru (via Galveston), March
31.â The Chilean Government, it is as
serted on good authority, will not sell
any warship to tht United States. The
Oregon is expected here on Saturday.
The gunboat Marietta, on finishing
coaling, contracted for cc-al for the
battle-ship Oregon and sailed for Val
paraiso at 8 o'clock this evening.

DECIDES TO
DEFER ACTION
Report of the Republican
Committee's Visit to
McKinley.
Convinced by the Executive
That He Is Making a
Firm Stand.
His Request for a Delay Until Next
Week Acceded To by the
Conference.
Special Dlspntch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 31.
The committee of Republicans ap
pointed at last night's conference to
call upon the President reached the
White House shortly before 3 o'clock
and was closeted with Mr. McKinley.
The committee comprised Representa
tives Hopkins, Mercer, Faris, Cooper,
Sulloway, Knox, Joy, Hager, Lorimer,
Pearson, Hepburn, and Smith of Mich
igan.
Representative Joy of Missouri, sec
retary of the Republican conference,
said that a canvass of the Republicans
of the House showed that 179 of them
would Insist upon the immediate and
absolute independence of Cuba.
The conference broke up at ten min
utes to 4 o'clock, and it waa announced
by some of the members that upon the
representations made by the President
they would advise the conference called
for 5:30 this afternoon at the Capitol to
adjourn until Monday. The President
gave them to understand that, in all
probability, he would have some com
munication to make to them by that
time and the reasons he advanced were
satisfactory to them.
Representative Hopkins of Illinois,
chairman, on his return to the House,
said that after they had spent an hour
with the President ...r. .McKinley con
vinced every member of the committee
that he was doing everything thai a
patriotic American could do to bring
about a just settlement of the Cuban
question and that the committee would
bo report to the conference which
Bent it.
The committee which waited on the !
President reported to the conference at '
a meeting held after the adjournment. I
It stated that the President made a |
frank declaration as to what was tak- j
ing place between the two Govern- |
ments, and concluded with thesewords:
"1 pray God that we may be able to
keep peace."
The impression left with the delega
tion, however was that he did not ex- j
pect a peaceable adjustment. In strict- j
est confidence Mr. McKinley outlined !
the course of communications between
Washington and Madrid. He stated j
that all now depended upon dispatches \
to be communicated and received, prob- I
ably within forty-eirht hours.
The response of Spain to a message <
cabled it by this Government was ex- j
pected hourly, and surely would be re- j
ceived within Uventy-four hours. After'
it arrived it would be necessary for
this country to send another cable note !
as a reply to Madrid. All this might !
be accomplished in less than forty- i
eight hours. He, therefore, intimated !
that it would be gratifying if Congress !
deferred taking action until next
week.
Mr. Hopkins of Illinois, who made the
report of tho committee, said he felt it
would be best to abide by the Presi
dent'fl wishes. Others who spoke at the
meeting, including Mr. Lorimer and Mr.
Joy, advised postponement. Ihe Pres
ident, they stated, suggested that what
was related to them reparding the dip
lomatic relations shouid not be repeat
ed until those negotiations were closed;
that if these secret and significant mes
sages were revealed at this time and
should become public property and be
cabled back to Madrid the publicity
might defeat the ends sought.
Representative Hicks of Pennsyl
vania thought that in view of the Du
puy de Lome letter no further parley
should be allowed and that Premier Sa
gasta was acting in accord with the
policy that the letter had revealed.
Others followed in the same line, but
It was finally concluded to defer action
until after the adjournment of the
House on Monday.
WANT NEW ORLEANS TO
3E A SUPPLY DEPOT-
Louisiana Congressmen Urge Upon
Secretary Long the Crescent
City's Advantages.
WASHINGTON, March 30.âAppar
ently there was no cessation to-day of
the extraordinary activity which has
prevailed at the Navy Department dur
ing the past month. Now that many
of the emergency preparations are well
under way, more attention is to be paid
to the broader question of a plan of
campaign in tBJ event of war. Under
this head comes the establishment of a
depot to be used as a base of supplies,
and on thiÂ« matter the commercial in
terests of the country are making them
selves heard.
Senato.- McEnery and Representa
tives Meyer. Ogden and Davey of Lou
isiana called upon Secretary Long to
day and supplemented the representa
tions of merchants who were here last
â week urging the selection of New Or
leans as a base of supplies. They said
the city, being situated some distance
from the Gulf, was reasonably safe
from attack by a fleet, and, being a
railroad center and situated on the
Mississippi River, grain and other sup
plies could bo shipped there in great
abundance. The Secretary did not
commit himself.
The delegation also spoke to the Sec
retary in regard to the defense of the
city of New Orleans, but the Secretary
expressed the opinion that with a for
midable fleet in the Gulf and such for
tifications as were already in existence
the city was well protected.
Provisions for Cuba.
WASHINGT >N, March 31.âRepre
sentative Wheeler of Alabama intro
duced a bill to-day appropriating $500,
000 to purchase provisions for the use
of the Cuban non-combatants and di
recting the President to cause them to
be conveyed at once to the starving
people and to use as much military and
naval forces as necessary to attain this
purpose. It also directs the President
to notify the Spanish government that
this proceeding is an act of humanity
and not intended as an act of war.
"Wyoming Stands Ready."
CHEYENNE, Wyo., March 31.âGov
ernor Richa- > to-day telegraphed
President McKlnley . "Wyoming stands
ready to furnish its quota of men in
case of war with Spain. Our National
Guard, consisting of one regiment of
Infantry and one two-gun battery, is
ready for service at your command."

WILL NOT ACT
UNTIL MONDAY
Attitude of the Senate
Foreign Relations
Committee.
Prepared to Move at Once When
the President Gives the
Word.
Nothing but the Absolute Independ
ence of Cuba Will Be
Considered.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office Riggs House,
Washington, March 31.
The Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations does not expect to attempt
to make a report until Monday on the
Cuban situation, as it will wait abso-.
I lutely upon the President's wishes un
j til that time. The committee, it is
! stated by its members, is proceeding
upon absolute information as to the
character of the negotiations between
this country and Spain, and this is to
the effect that the independence of
Cuba is made the one essential eonsid
i eration of the negotiations. The Presi
dent has told Spain in so many words
that it is useless to go farther upon any j
other understanding. Having this
assurance, the committee is proceeding!
i deliberately and with no desire unne
1 cessarily to press the question of the I
! form of a resolution to be brought in |
â¢ until it is necessary to decide that j
point, which can be done In a few mo- ]
ments. Indeed, it is the expectation
! that the President himself by Monday
will indicate the action he would like
to have Congress take in case of the
failure of his diplomacy, and the pres
ent inclination of the committee is to
follow his leadership in this respect.
This inclination is due to the fact,
I however, that the committee, in this
I event, will be prepared for armed inter
j vention to procure the freedom of the
! Cubans.
The committee is not counting confl-
I dently upon being called upon to make
i a declaration to this end, but is prepar
ing for it, and it is stated will have the
facts in its possession if called upon
ito act. It is to this end that Captain !
I Sigsbee, Commander Bradford and j
others were summoned before the com
! mittee to-day.
Captain Sigsbee of the Maine, and ;
Captain Barker, Secretary Long's na- |
val aide, who went to Key West after |
the explosion on behalf of the depart- â¢
ment. were before the committee for
i an hour at the afternoon session. Botn
I were examined in detail in regard to ; '
I the condition and strength of our navy
in the vicinity of Havana, and Cap- j ,
i tain Sigsbee was questioned as to his j ,
opinion and knowledge of the Maine
i disaster. His story was not materi- i
j ally different from that detailed to the i
I Naval Court of Inquiry, but the fact i
that it was given personally to the 1 ,
I members of the committee and includ- '
! ed personal deductions made a visible [
! impression upon the members. Cap- j
! tain Sigsbee did not express a convlc- |
I tion in so many words, that the dis- |
; aster was the result of treachery on j
! the part of the Spanish, but after the i
; committee had concluded its hearings .
one of its members expressed his be- j
lief that the explosion was due to that j
agency.
The purpose in taking the testimony j
; of those naval officers is to incorpor- j
ate their statements in a report which ;
I the committee will make in case it
i finds it necessary to report a resolu
1 tion for intervention. This report will ;
! be in the nature of a statement to the !
I country justifying the position taken I
| and it is considered desirable to sup-
I port this with an array of the perti- i
i nent facts which Avill go far to con- j
i vince the American people and the civ- j
! ilized world of the Justice of the course j
taken.
When the report which was circu
lated during the afternoon to the ef
fect that Spain had rejected the pro- j
: posals of the United States was brought 'â 
i to the attention of the committee, Sen- j
; ator Davis went to the chamber and >
' asked that there should be no adjourn
ment until Monday, as had been con
templated. This led to the surmise that
in case the report of Spain's refusal
should be verified the committee might j
bring in its report. It was stated
later, however, that the committee had
not changed its plans, and that it prob
ably would wait upon the President
at least until Monday, if he should de
sire.
There is no doubt that the commit
tee Is preparing to report very speed
ily in case It should feel called upon
to do so. There has been no poll nt
the committee and no formulation of
a resolution, but there has been a very
general expression of views. This ex
pression has so far taken the shape of
a recognition of the independence of
the Cubans, together with a declaration
for intervention sufficient to guarantee
this independence, and the best opin
ion is that such a resolution will be
the ultimate result of the committee's
deliberations if Spain insist? upon con
tinuing the Cuban war and holding the
island.
VESUVIUS IS ALMOST
READY FOR SERVICE.
Dynamite Cruiser Will Soon Sail
From the Washington Navy
Yard.
WASHINGTON, March 31.â The work !
of overhauling the dynamite cruiser Ye- i
! suvius, completeing the work on her }
â  guns and fitting her for active service I
j is almost finished, and she probabl> j
will be ordered to leave the Washing- j
ton navy yard within the next two :
I days. It is thought she will go first
I to Norfolk and then proceed to south-
I crn waters. The men are giving her a
i coat of black paint, preparatory to
painting her a dark green. The officers !
say that It is almost Impossible to dis- j
cover a vessel at night when painted '
j with this color, even by means of a
searchlight. One of the officers said, j
: discussing the possibilities of hostili- '
| ties:
"There is one satisfaction about be
ing aboard a ship like this: In case we j
are struck right there will be no board
| of Inquiry, and no trouble about divers,
etc., for there will not be a piece of the
boat left big enough for a souvenir. A
I boat of this style does 1 fearful damage!
| to her enemies or goes under in such I
order herself. Modern war will, in my I
opinion, be quick work, Anyhow, and j
we represent the very quickest type of j
death-dealing vessels afloat."
The work on the cannon now in prog- \
ress of completion at the navy yard is
being rushed with all the haste possi
; ble. Upward of 500 men have been
; added to the force employed in ordi
nary times.

HAVANA (via Herald-Call dispatch
steamer to Key West), March 31. â The
negro's crime in Guanabacoa, just
across the bay from Havana, yester- j
day, created a disturbance that came j
near ending in most serious results, j
Lieutenant-Colonel Benedito of La
Reina Battalion, Spanish army, was
shot and seriously wounded while call
ing at the home of Dr. Francisco Vidal, j
5 Camerera. When the soldiers of j
Colonel Benedito's command heard of !
the affair they became infuriated. Seiz- j
ing their rifles they paraded the streets |
of the little suburb, intimidating resi
dents and in several instances assault- 'â 
| ing passers-by with the butts of their j
I guns and flats of their swords. Many j
i citizens were arrested by them and i
j forcibly taken to the barracks, but they !
were afterward released. Two persons
j were wounded during the disorder, |
; which at no time reached the propor
j tions of a riot. It was reported that
one citizen had been killed, but thus \
far I have been unable to verify the j
rumor.
Colonel Benedito's wound, while very
serious, is not necessarily fatal. He
la now in the military hospital Alfon
|so Doce and reported doing well. The
rumor circulated last night that there \
was a scandal at the bottom of the j
affair is not believed to be well found- i
cd. It is generally thought now the [
negro assailant was animated solely by â 
motives of revenge for the death of the '
brilliant young insurgent chief, Gene- I
ral Nestor Aranguen, who was almost j
idolized by the Cubans of Guanabacoa
and vicinity.
The deportation of Musgrave, the cor- ;
| respondent of the New York Journal
; and London Chronicle, to Cadiz yester
day, was much discussed among the
British and Americans at Havana. ;
j Musgrave having made no secret of his
' recent experiences in an insurgent
| camp, continued to go boldly about the I
I streets and cafes of the city. No one I
questions the perfect right of Spanish
authorities- to arrest and deport him.
', There is much criticism, however, of the
method of arrest and deportation. Mus
| grave was kept incommunicado a whole i
i day without an opportunity to com- I
municate with friends or the British
Consul, and then put aboard the Span
â  ish mail steamer Buenos Ayres, with- â 
i out even a change of linen, or any j
; other clothing except that on his back.
British Consul Gallon learned of Mus
: grave's plight just before the steamer
| sailed for Cadiz, but did not go to see
; him. To-day Mr. Gallon says he will
I endeavor to arrange to have Musgrave
] provided with clothing and other com- j
I forts when the steamship touches Porto i
I Rico en route to Spain. Musgrave's :
: movements have hem carefully watch- '.
\ ed by the police since his return from :
the rebel camp recently. He knew thK
but overestimated the tolerance of the
military authorities of the present re- I
: gime.
General Luque's operations in the '
east, as officially reported, were rose-
I colored fakes. It turns out now that
there was no attack by the Spaniards*.
I am in a position to say that Luqu*:
with 1200 infantry, 700 cavalry, forces '
; of artillery, two rapid-fire guns and
i marine infantry under Colonel Carrillo
i started March 26 from Puerto Padrt,
j escorting an important convoy to Sim
i Augustine, where he was attacked at
j Mania bon, Cementerio, Aguarras and
Marino. Luque losing on the journey
I forty-six killed and sixty-seven wouna
| ed, while the Cubans' loss was com
paratively small because they am
bushed the Spaniards and only attacked
at an advantage. It is not known
whether Luque lost the supplies.

WELCOMED TO
LOS ANGELES
Teachers of Southern Cal
ifornia Gather in Con
vention.
Mayor Snyder Gives Them
Greeting on Behalf of
' the City.
Some Trite Advice From the Stand
point of One Who Is Not an
Instructor.
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 31.â The first
session of the Southern California
Teachers' Association opened to-day in
the Congregational Church. The at
i tendance is large. In welcoming the
! teachers to this city Mayor M. P. Sny-
I der spoke in part as follows:
As the city's executive, it affords me
much pleasure to extend 10 you a most
hearty welcome to Los Angeles on the oc
casion of the seventh annual convention
of the Teachers' Association of the seven
southern counties of California, it is in
deed a pleasure to welcome so distin
guished, so intelligent, so representative
a gathering. Here are ladies and gentle
men who play a most important part in
supplying the materials out of which is
constructed the mighty rudder which
steers our grand ship of state.
It is you, ladies and gentlemen, who
first teach the little ones how to creep
in the world of letters, in the world of
science, in every branch of useful knowl
edge. The scenes of your labor and de
votion to a grand calling are laid in a
land of wonderful possibilities. The lit
tle freckle-faced, red-haired youngster
who exhausts your patience at times
with his uncontrollable desire to engage
In mischief, anrt who knows vastly more
about marbles, tops and kites than about
spelling and mathematical problems, may
some day sway a great convention with
his eloquence; he may some day bo presi
dent of Harvard, Yale or Princeton; he
may bo a financial Napoleon; he may be
a President of the United states.
I believe that teachers oftentimes make
a mistake in the way they deal with char
acters such as the one I have just men
tioned. It takes a wonderful lot of pa
tience, I presume, for one to daily try to
hammer knowledge into the head of a
youngster who seems utterly indifferent,
and yet as the history of all nations will
serve to illustrate, these same freckly,
uninteresting youngsters have in many
instances shone brightest in the world's
history, while other boys whose prospects
had been brilliant as the noonday sun
never reached even the first round of the
ladder of fame.
So don't lose interest m the slow boys.
Pound knowledge into their heads
whether they want it or not, and some
day, when one or more of them has made
a good name for himself, he will not for
get you.
Do not understand me, ladies and gen
tlemen, as taking sides with the slow,
uninteresting boy as against the live,
energetic boy. Wiin me they both have
the same weight in the scale of success.
All were created equal and .all were put
on earth for a purpose, and such being
the case you who have their futures in
hand have a grave responsibility, which
each of you, I know, fully appreciates
and which will not pass from your hands
slighted.
The members of this association are en
gaged in a noble work. All the condi
tions are favorable to them. I wish each
of you unlimited success in your labors,
ami bespeak for "jighi the reward which
comes to deservlne, ones. Permit me. in
conclusion, again to extend to you a
most hearty welcome to our fair city.
May the convention prove a source of
much benefit to yourselves and to South
ern California.
Th subject of "American History' in
Public Schools" was handled by Pro
fessor C. A. Duniway of Stanford Uni
versity. He said American history
should be taught because of the im
portant knowledge which it contained.
He severely attacked an address de
livered by Hon. Frank Davis before the
County Teachers' Institute yestt* 'ay.
Tae speaker said that if te&cnera had
understood as much of American his
lory as they should they would have
repudiated the statements of Mr. Davis
regarding loyalty to the "boss," which
meant that boys should be taught the
necessity of keeping that worthy sup
plied with cigars and beer. The "boss"
was by no means the honorable leader
of the people, but a politician who used
power for his own ends. There should
be only scorn for such statements.

New Charter Club took action to-night
to expose another of the unprincipled
methods used by the "gang" in the â¢
present campaign. At a well attended }
and enthusiastic meeting the following j
resolutions were adopted:
Whereas, Reports have been sedulously !
disseminated by the political boss of the
city of San Jose and the county of Santa
Clara and his adherents to the effect that
it was the intention of the officers elected
or appointed through the efforts of the
Xew Charter Club and kindred organiza
tions to make extensive changes in the ;
list of public school teachers without re- !
gard to fitness or competency; and where- â 
as, the same gang has been actively en- j
gaged in spreading reports that the sal- ;
aries of all teachers in the city are to be j
reduced by the friends of the new char- |
ter; and whereas, this same band of self
seeking politicians has caused reports to
be circulated to the effect that the friends [
of the new charter intend to abolish tho
kindergarten system of schools in this
city; be it
Resolved, That we denounce each and i
all of these reports as absolutely false I
and without foundation in fact.
Resolved. That we denounce the course
pursued by these enemies of good gov

this subject.

OF REGAN
Exciting Man Hunt
in the Madera
Foothills.
Outlaws Making Their
Way to Coarse Gold
Gulch.
Pursuing Sheriffs Confident
That They Are After the
Right Men.
MINERS' CABINS LOOTED.
Evidence Found to Prove That the
Fugitives Robbed tha Los
Anjeles Express.
.: Dispatch to The Call.
MERCED, March 31.â The pence offi
cers are hot on the trail of Cliff llegan
and his mysterious confederate, w!. a
are accused of having robbed the L s
Angeles express at Cross Creek on t:.e
night of March 22. Late this after
noon It was decided by the pursuing
Sheriffs' posses that the two robbers
were making from Indian Gulch, in tiie
western end of Mafiposa County t io
ward Coarse Gold Gulch in Madera
County. At that time the officers be
lieved they were only a short distar.ee
behind the fleeing bandits. The pur
suers are positive that the two men
they are after are the ones who robbed
the train.
C. C. Crowley, the chief of the South
ern Pacific's detective force, wh" for
a few days took a prominent part, yes
terday tame back from the mountains
where the robbers are hiding ami
)y expressed himself as being positive
that his brother officers were on the
wrong scent. He claimed that Cliff
Kegan and his partner were not the
train robbers, but a pair of petty
thieves, who were afraid of being
i.'-hed for stealing a horse and buÃ
Crowley's theory was completely up
â¢ by Supervisor S. L. M. El
lis of Tulare, who accidentally ame
upon the BUSpei ted bandits, late in the
forenoon of the day the train was
robbed, in a deserted barn at>oul a mile
from the scene of the hold-up. Ellis
on that occasion conversed with-Re
gan, but the bandit's partner ke] t his
< oncealed under the corner of a
blanket, while feigning sleep. The cur
iosity of Ellis was aroused and he took
particular notice of the buggy and the
horses the men had with them. Their
;.- was lilted with shafts, bt tho
outlaws had two horses. One was
black and the other
by the two bandits, who are i;< v hid
ing somewhere between Indian and
â â d gulch-s. and to-day Super
visor Ellia went to Hornitos, where the
t the bandits waa being kept by
the Sheriff, and positively Identified the
horse and the buggy as the one he had
Been in the deserted barn near Cross
Creek only a few hours before th.; train
was Stopped.
When the officers captured the buggy
they found the camp outfit of the ban
dits with it. Two pairs of Dlankfs
were tied in a tight roll and bound
with a peculiarly wrrn cotton rope.
Some short pieces of rope similar to the
piece that bound the blankets were
found in the barn where Sup rvisor
Ellia saw the bandits, and pieces of a
similar rope were used in bind.ng to
gether the sticks of giant powder that
were used to wreck the baggagp car
to bK^v open the safe of \y>Hs
"'s messenger. The Sheriffs believe
the bandits prepared the bombs
they used while in the barn and left
s of rope behind them when they
Depleted their work.
Ellis is positive of his identification
of the horse and buggy. Th^ horse the
as deserted was the black one.
Wh; i they dÂ»id with the sorrel has not
y<-t been learned. Tfc." black horse was
bra;; !Â« .1 on the left hip with an "H "
the Becond downward stroke of which
had a '.v.-n-defined curve to the right
like a J" turned th" wrong way. The
animal had a peculiarly shaped head
and Ellis, being an expert horseman
said it was a horse not easy to forget'
The buggy had some pe< ullar trim
mings to the dashboard, and Kilis pro
nounced it the same vehicle the mo
ment he saw it to-day.
This identification of the property
abandoned by the bandits is in the
opinion of the Sheriffs, conclusive evi
dence that they are on the right trail
From all that can be learned the rob
bers have now only a scant supply of
and the officers expect hourly to
hear of them raiding some of the cab
ins of the prospectors that are
tered sparsely along the trail the ban
dits are taking. The two men are on
foot and are traveling slowly. Appar
ently they are remaining under cover
during the day and taking ad vantage <rf
the darkness to put as much distance
as they can between themselves and
their pursuers.

dodged into the thick underbrush as
soon as they were seen by a wood
chopper, and for a short distance
doubled on their tracks. The night be
fore they were not far from Indian
Gulch. On that evening they demand
ied supper from a Portuguese sheep
! herder at the points oÂ£ their pistols.
Regan entered the hut of the herder,
and, with a pistol in each hand, ordered
the Portuguese to prepare a meal for
himself and a companion, who was
guarding' the house from the outside.
The herder was obliged to leave the hut
to get some water, and as he walked
out through the door Regan command
ed him not to be so inquisitive as to
look at the man outside. The Portu
'â  guese prepared the meal and Regan
t< -k the food. When he left the hut he
threatened to take the life of the herd
: er if he told of the visit. The two men
a'.e outside the cabin in the darkness,
keeping the herder within his hut.
About two hours later the bandits en
tered the hut of a miner about a half
mile further east along the gulch and
helped themselves to what provisions
they could find. They divided a piece
â¢if bacon the minor had, taking about
I three pounds of it. They took about
i three pounds of flour, some salt and
I some beans. That is, as far as the
Sheriffs know, the only food the fugi
tives have.
Yesterday it was the plan of the pur
suers to station men at all huts in the
vicinity of where the robbers were
last seen in the hope of inviting Dattle
with them when hunger should drive
them from their hiding places. The two
bandits are well armed, carrying either
a rifle or a shotgun each, and each has
a braoe of pistols. Regan is known to
be a desperate man and one who will
fight to the death when cornered. His
partner is not known. No one can give
a description of him except that he Is
taller than Regan. H has been care
ful to keep out of sight and Regan for
some reason keeps him in the dark
when it becomes necessary to raid any
cabin for food. The country the ban
dits are heading for is wild and rough
in the extreme, and many of its set
tlers are persons who do not object to
taking chances with the law whenever
an opportunity presents itself. Regan
is well acquainted with the district and
the sheriffs believe he will bo sur
rounded by sympathisers and shielded
by them. They agree that if they do
not have him in custody by the end of
the week it will be useless to keep up
the present vigorous chase. AIT they
can do will be to wait until the des
peradoes are betrayed for the sake of
the heavy rewards now offered.
Regan is wanted by the peace officers
of nearly every county in the San Joa
quin Valley. His crimes within the
past three years are numerous and his
I ability to escape his pursuers in that
I time has led him to do bolder deeds of
crime. On December 23 last he. with
John B. dough, robbed a Chinese camp
lin Merced County. In the excitement
I that fallowed when the two men burst
i Into the house <>f the Chinese several
shots were fired.
Regan did nearly .all the shooting,
and one of his bullets struck his part
ner in the thigh, fracturing his leg.
Regan stole a horse and wagon from a
neighboring rancher's barn, and. lifting
his wounded companion into the rig,
drove him nearly sixty miles to within
a short distance of the County Hospital
of Fresno, and there dumped the
wounded man on the roadside. Clough
was found soon afterward and taken
to the hospital. When he was able to
be moved he was brought to the jail !
here and he is now awaiting trial for j
robbery. Cloueh claims Regan's shot â 
was not accidental, but that his partner j
intended to kill him to avoid having to
divide the plunder.
Regan served a term of two years in
Pan Quentin.for robbery, having been j
i sentenced from Fresno. He was liberat- i
ed about three years ago, and ever
! since has been the chief actor in a car- j
nival of crime. His description as j
registered at San Quentin gives his age j
nt 2* years, and says he is of medium ;
complexion, brown hair and eyes deep ;
. set and gray. He stands 5 feet 6V&
Inches, and at the time of his entrance j
to the prison weighed 14"> pounds. He j
has large features, thin lips, high eh<>ek i
bones, and is of medium build. He has
a set of perfect teeth, and that is de
scribed as his most characteristic fea
ture. He has been employed at times
as a vaquero, and durinr- sruch employ
ment he has ridden several times over
the country where he is now leading
the Sheriffs a lively chase.
DR. MAITLAND LEAVES
MOURNING CREDITORS.
Neglected to Meet a Few Obliga
tions Before Forsaking Los
Angeles.
I.OS ANGELES, March 31.â Dr. W. A.
Maitland came here a few months ago
and cut a wide swath. He was grave and
polished and soon ingratiated himself
among the swell people. He was an Eng

tralia, where he claimed to have acquired
the title of "Honorable." He stopped at
swell hotels.
Maitland has decamped, leaving behind
him a crowd of victims. He claimed to
own a castle in Great Britain, and al
loged that he was very wealth .-. He es
tablished a credit which he uÂ«ed with
reckless freedom. Mr. and Mrs. G. T.
Isaacson of Seventh and Olive streets are
among his victims.
The doctor moved from here to San
Francisco, and was at the Palace Hotel
for a time. When word was wired to the
north to hold him, it was found he had
decamped from the hotel, taking his bag

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 1, 1898.
DESPONDENT
BECAUSE OF
HIS POVERTY
Ex-Consul Churchill
Was in Need of
Employment.
Growing Belief That He
Put an End to His
Life.
Mrs. Churchill Positive That
Her Husband Is a
Suicide.
THEIR LAST FAREWELL.
Kissed Her Affaetionately and Da
parted, Presumably to Seek
Work.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 31.â Although
the police of New York and Brooklyn
have been searching for him since last
Monday, they can find no trace of Wil
liam Churchill, who until last fall waa
counsel for this Government at Apia,
Samoa, He strangely disappeared on
Monday from his home, in Brooklyn.
His wife, who is prostrated by grief
and the effects of an illness that pre-
ceded his disappearance, is positive her
husband has committed suicide.
Churchill returned to Brooklyn al
most penniless because of business re
verses in Samoa. He tried hard, but
was unable to obtain employment.
While In Apia, Mr. Churchill became
involved in trouble with the natives.
This trouble and his wife's illness
caused him to leave the islands. Since
he returned he has searched for work
in newspaper offices.
"He would never have left me," said
Mrs. Churchill, "did he not intend to
kill himself. Adverse circumstances
have so preyed upon his mind that I
am afraid he has become demented.
This suspense is killing me. His only
relatives are in Mount Vernon, but had
he gone there they would have tele
graphed to me."
Mrs. Churchill has been inbed for four
weeks, although ill since her return
from Samoa last fajl. She last saw
her husband on Monday morning at
about 4 o'clock, when she awoke to find
him fully dressed. He took both her
hands in his, kissed hÂ«r affectionately
and smoothed her hair until she was
asleep. As he failed to return that day
she thought he had obtained employ
ment and did not worry until ver- late,
when she sent word of his disappear
ance to the police.
Mr. Churchill was born in Brooklyn
thirty-eight years ago. After complet
ing his studies at Yale, he began work
ing for the London Geographical So
ciety and served in the South Seas. La
ter he toak up newspaper work, which
was uninterrupted until 1896, excepting
for a brief service in the Government
signal service. He has a son nineteen
y?ars old. The missing man was a per
sonal friend of the late Robert Louis
Stevenson.
SUES FOR HIS
UNCLE'S GOLD
Lawyer Wright of Seattle
Seeks Judgment on
a Note.
Wants a Portion of the Late
Samuel P. Blair's
Estate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 31.â The trial of a
sensational suit was commenced this
afternoon in the Superior Court. J<rhn
B. Wright, a well-known young lawyer
of is city. is the plaintiff, and he is
suing the administrator of the estate
of his rich uncle, Captain Samuel P.
Blair of San Francisco, who died last
year, upon a note for $25,000. Frank J.
Burns is the administrator and he re
sists the payment of the note on the
ground that it either was never exe
cuted by the uncle and is a forgery, or
was obtained by the nephew from the
old man by fraud and deceit.
The nephew contends and claims he
will be able to prove by a number of
crecitable witnesses that the note was
given to him by his uncle as compensa
tion for services rendered in the past
and to be rendered in the future, in
caring for his uncle's property in King
County.
The Blair estate in King County is
worth about $45,000 and in California
about $300,000. The plaintiff is a brother
of Mrs. Guy G. Phinney of Seattle,
whose suit for $100,000 against the Mu
tual Life Insurance Company of New
York has become familiar throughout
the country. It will come up before the
United States Supreme Court next week
for final disposition.
The note on which Wright brings
suit was presumably made in August,
1895, i.ayable within five years from
September, 1894, and is to have
been given in lieu of a note made by
Blair to Wright in the fall of 1894,
which was by mutual agreement de
stroyed, it having been in Wright's
own handwriting and the latter's law
yers, it is alleged, having advised him
to have the note made out on a regular
printed form. The note is accompanied
by a separate written contract in which
Wright agrees with Blair that the note
shall not mature until three years after
the latter's death if he shall live be
yond the date of the maturity of note.
The contract is signed by Wright's
mother, who is Blair's sister, as a wit
ness.
The defense claims that the contract,
also, was fraudulently obtained or
forged.
Child Chokes to Death.
FRESNO, March 31.â Katie Borgar, the
infant daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alexan
der Borgar, choked to death this morning.
The child was playing on the floor and
is supposed to nave swallowed a screw
which she had picked up. She began to
cough, and a few minutes later died in
her mother's arms. The screw Is sup
posed to have entered her trachea.
ALASKAN RUSH
NOW ABATING
A Great Falling Off in
Travel From the
Sound.
Steamships Leave Port With
but Little of Their Space
Occupied.
The Cleveland Unable to Obtain Suf
ficient Business to Warrant
tha Trip.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 31.â Travel to
Alaska has fallen of tremendously.
During the last two weeks arrivals
from Eastern States have been fewer
than at any time since December, while
almost every day has seen another
steamship added to the Alaskan fleet.
Light passenger and freight lists are
resulting in many instances.
The steamship Cleveland, owned by
Nelson & Co. of San Francisco,
was to-day tied at the seawall, the bus
iness offering this week being insuffi
cient to warrant sending her out. It
is understood she will remain in port
at least ten days. She has made three
trips north under charter by the
Washington and Alaska Steamship
Company since her wreck on Vancou
ver Island, and is bringing her owners
over $400 a day whether running or
idle. The popular steamship Seattle,
operated by the same company, goes
north crowded every trip.
The steamship Australia sailed to
night with only 100 passengers from
Tacoma and Seattle, though she can
carry 600. Her freight is likewise
light. It was reported to-day she would
be taken off after this trip, but her
agents say to-night she will continue
running, as the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company chartered her six weeks ago
for three months from the Oriental and
Occidental Steamship Company. The
falling off in travel is attributed to dis
couraging reports from the trails and
the prospects of war with Spain.
LURED BY TALES OF
A LAND OF GOLD.
i Members of the Girder Party Find
Themselves Stranded at
Aiyansh.
VICTORIA, March 31.â J. H. Lovejoy
of San Francisco returned by the Bos
cowitz this morning, having made the
attempt to get Into the Yukon country
first by the Stikeen and then by the
! Skeena, in each case without success.
Lovejoy met the Girder party, which
left here on the Boscowitz a few weeks
i ago, at Aiyansh, and he brings news
' which tends to confirm the doubts en
tertained in this city when the party
left here, as to the chances of success
attending the adventures of the fifty
men who placed themseives under Gir
der's guidance, expecting, in return for
the sum of $75 each, to be niloted to a
locality where fabulously rich diggings
existed. Girder, who hails from Los
Angeles, brought the majority of his
party from Calif ornia, he having by
showing them rich samples of ore and
dust induced each to pay him $75 to
pilot them to the place where the gold
was to be found. Lovejoy learned
something at Port Simpson, on his way
down, which tends to' show that the un
fortunate men are being gulled and de
frauded by Girder.
Girder had for some time before
starting been in communication with a
miner at Port Simpson, and it was from
him the nuggets and samples shown by
Girder were obtained, Girder himself
having no knowledge of the diggings
from which they were taken.
When Lovejoy left the unfortunate
men at Aiyansh they had broken into
revolt, although until then they had
experienced only the easiest part of
their trip, that by canoe from the
mouth of the I keena to the commence
ment of the alleged trail. They were
holding meetings daily and threaten
ing Girder with vengeance, and on more
than one occasion rope was brought
out and the more turbulent ones de
manded that Girder be lynched. Love
joy feared that â¢>. hen the members of
the party learned- -as they would as
soon as they started from Aiyansh â
that the trail was impassable, they will
make trouble. Many of the men have
not the wherewithal to return, the way
forward is blocked and their stock of
provisions is, scanty.
BEEVES FOR MINERS
IN THE YUKON LAND.
Fifteen Hundred Cattle to Be Driven
to the Gold Fields of the
North.
SEATTLE, March 31.â C. W. Thebo
is now in the city arranging to sup
ply the Yukon country with beef. He
and Patrick Galvin, both well known
in the valley of the Yukon, have pur
chased 1500 fat beeves and will take
them over the Dalton trail to Fort
Selkirk and thence by steamship to the
gold fields. The first shipment will be
by the barge Skookum, which will start
early in May for Haines Mission or
Pyramid Harbor.
Thebo will have with him not less
than seventy-five men in the handling
of this immense herd of cattle. Many
of them will be men whom he has
known on the cattle trails between
Montana and California in years gone
by. A steamship is now being built
at San Francisco for Galvin & Thebo,
to be operated on the Upper Yukon
River. It will be engaged in carry
ing their livestock from Fort Selkirk.

WARRANT ISSUED
FOR AZHDERIAN
Nevill's Accuser Wanted at
Fresno on a Charge
of Fraud.
Accu&ed by a Contractor of Having
Obtained Goods by False
Pretenses.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, March 31.â A complaint was
issued this afternoon for the arrest of
Myron H. Azhderian on a charge of ob
taining goods under false pretenses.
Azhderian is the Armenian who was fore
man of Captain Nevills' vineyard, and
who attained notoriety by bringing an
action against Nevills for $50,000 damages
for, alleged mistreatment and imprison
ment in the Palace hotel in San Fran

TALL BUILDINGS AND EARTHQUAKES.
rOR many years the people of San Francisco
were doubtful whether it would ever be safe to
erect in this city tall buildings of brick or stone.
It was only by slow degrees that enterprising build
ers overcame the fear and ventured upon the con
struction of such edifices of more than two stories.
With the advent of the American style of construc
tion, however, which consists in making the entire
framework of the building of steel or iron, well
braced and bound, and using the walls of masonry
simply as a covering, a new courage was born in the
city, and since that time there have been erected here
some of the tallest edifices of their kind in the world.
Most well informed people had confidence in the
strength of the new buildings to withstand any shock
likely to come against them, but there were still some
skeptics, and more or less interest has always been
felt to know just exactly what would happen when
a severe shock put the high structures to the test.
That test has now been given. The experiment
has been tried. The shock of Wednesday night was
one of the severest ever felt in San Francisco. It
reminded old settlers of the great shocks of the past
which are memorable in our history and which led to
those exaggerated reports that caused California to
be reputed in the East as a land subject to disastrous
earthquakes of frequent recurrence. The tall build
ings stood the test without suffering any damage
whatever. Not the slightest injury befell any of them,
no danger involved any of their tenants.
As a matter of fact the new style of architecture is
about the safest that could possibly be adopted to re
sist the shocks of earthquake. A one-story adobe
house would go to ruins before one of the sky
scrapers whose framework is composed of steel de
signed by skillful men to stand every sort of strain,
whether lateral or perpendicular, that can be brought
against it. Even a shock severe enough to shake
down the walls that inclose such a structure would
leave its framework intact, and people within it, how
ever badly frightened, would remain uninjured.
After this experience there will be no longer any
skepticism of the safety of tall buildings. It has been
years since we had a shock equal to that of Wednes
day night, and it will probably be many years before
we have another. Even if such shocks came every
year they would do no harm to modern structures.
The steel sky scraper is proof against any danger of
that kind, and hereafter there will be hardly a doubt
of it in the minds of even the most timid on the sub
ject.
THE NAVAL APPROPRIATION BILL.
1â; OR1 â ;OR one reason or another the House of Repre
sentatives has been unexpectedly slow in pass
ing the naval appropriation bill. The debate on
it, which has been prolonged by frequent interrup
tions for the purpose of discussing the crisis with
Spain, has not up to this time disclosed any valid
cause for delay at all, and yet it is by no means cer
tain when it will be adopted and sent to the Senate.
The delay is the more surprising because when the
bill was reported from the committee it was received
with marked favor not only in Washington, but
throughout the country. It is the most liberal naval
appropriation measure on record in the United States
in time of peace, and is therefore in harmony with
popular sentiment and in accord with the needs of
the emergency. Had it been a parsimonious measure
of so-called economy it would probably have been
permitted to pass at once, and it seems therefore that
the very feature which renders it acceptable to the
public is the cause why it has been objected to.
It will be remembered that the bill as reported
carries with it appropriations for the construction of
five new drydoeks, to be located at Portsmouth, Bos
ton, League Island (near Philadelphia), Algiers (near
New Orleans) and Mare Island (near this city).
This clause has been the subject of considerable con
troversy, particularly that portion of it authorizing
the construction of the dock at Algiers, but from the
latest reports it is not likely that any portion of it
will be stricken out. As a matter of fact the number
of new docks provided for is none too great for the
needs of a nation with such an extensive seacoast as
ours, and if any alteration is to be made in the bill
as reported the number should be increased instead
of diminished.
The total expenditure provided for by the bill is
about $36,000,000. It authorizes, in addition to the
new drydocks referred to, the construction of sixteen
new vessels, including three battle-ships, makes large
allowances for increasing the heavy ordnance of the
navy, extending the facilities of the more important
navy yards of the country, and for augmenting the
naval force by 1750 enlisted men and 250 apprentices.
Nearly all of the money required for these works and
extensions will of course be expended in the United
States, and when it is remembered with what prompt
ness the House passed the bill appropriating $50,000,
000 for national defense when it was known that most
of it would be used in purchasing ships and war
equipments from foreign countries, it is a little sur
prising that so much time should be required to pro
vide iar naval extension at home.
THE EARTHQUAKE fJND THE
UNTRUTH-
IT is impossible to understand why there should
have been such gross misrepresentation as to the
earthquake which did San Francisco the honor of
calling Wednesday night. Just what was hoped to
be accomplished by the statements that great harm
had been done when in fact the harm was trivial, its
infliction unattended by danger, is beyond the ken
of any mind save, perhaps, that guiding the destinies
of a journal which keeps upon its staff the entire per
sonnel of the Vatican, the crowned heads of Europe
and a few eminent back numbers like Bismarck and
Gladstone.
It is true that the shock of Wednesday was the
most severe since 1868, when three or four people
who rushed into the open were killed by debris
hurled from the flimsy buildings marking that period.
It is also true that Wednesday's experience, while start
ling, was nothing more. Not a structure was injured,
unless it happened to be so defective from age that a
summer breeze would have been fatal to it. Yet an
effort was made to create the impression that the city
had undergone contact with a great catastrophe.
How foolish this was is apparent here. In the East
the fool statements may be accepted and the result
be injurious. It will tend to scare people away.
The East has its blizzards, which yearly claim
many victims. It has its heated term, during which
people and dumb animals drop writhing and dying in
the streets. It has its scores stricken every season by
lightning. In the Middle West the dread cyclone
yearly reaps its harvest of death. Villages and towns
are laid waste and farm improvements vanish before
the sweeping cloud like a dream. Portions of the
South have an almost annual calamity due to floods.
Yet because in California there is an occasional
temblor, which ordinarily is wholly innocuous, an
effort is made to create the idea that this is a place
of chronic disaster. If such effort came from the out
side it might be ascribed to ignorance. As it comes
from within, we look in vain for the motive.
California is peculiarly blessed. It has no cyclones.
It does not know the touch of sunstroke. Its winters
are kindly, bringing neither blizzard nor deadening
cold. It has no thunderstorms, with their accom
paniment of lightning. In fact, it is marked by an
entire absence of the natural phenomena which in
every other region add to nature the element of ter
ror. Its earthquakes are not frequent, and only a
comparatively violent one is considered worthy of
more than passing mention. And a violent one, such
as that of Wednesday night, can be classed as nothing
more than an interesting experience, doing less
damage than the sudden April hower which may
perchance flood a cellar or wash away the promising
crop of early peas.
REPORTS OF CROP CONDITIONS.
WITHOUT continuing the controversy with the
San Jose Mercury as to whether the recent
publication in The Call of an Associated Press
dispatch to the effect that a severe frost following a
recent rain in Santa Clara County had caused an al
most total loss of the fruit crop in the valley was
or was nor a slander upon the county, it may be
rioted that hardly any department of news gathering
is more important to the general public and more
perplexing to newspapers than that dealing with the
crop outlook.
The condition of crops varies with the weather and
other climatic phenomena from month to month,
and even from week to week. So extensive are these
changes of condition and so uncertain is the per
manency of any of them that the most experienced
farmers, orchardings and vine-growers are often at a
loss to judge accurately of the real situation of even
the products of their own lands. A crop that looks
flourishing to-day may be blighted before the har
vest, and another which to-day seems weak and un
profitable may by some fortunate combination of
earth and sky be brought to a bountiful fruition.
Insufficient as are the reports, the importance of
the information is so great that it is imperative to
make every possible effort to obtain it. It is better
to publish an estimate of crop conditions this week
and correct :t next week than not to publish it at all.
The agricultural output of any season in this country
represents many millions of dollars and involves the
welfare of millions of people. Under our commen-ial
system it is necessary for the producer of any kind
of product to know something of the condition of that
particular crop throughout the country in order that
he may form an intelligent estimate of what his crop
is to be worth in the market.
It would be a pleasant task for newspapers to pub
lish nothing but optimistic reports â to announce
from week to week that all crops are flourishing and
that even r county is prosperous. Such reports, how
ever, would have the effect of convincing many peo
ple that there was to be an overproduction. This
would result in what is known as "bearing the mar
ket," and would do in the long run more damage
than good.
It is fair to assume that the unfavorable conditions
of the winter, the drought and the frosts have had a
depressing effect on the farmers of the State, and per
haps their reports at present are somewhat affected
by their fears, and the crops may turn out much
better than has been expected from their reports.
Nevertheless, it will not be wise for any producer to
discount such estimates too much. It is no slander
upon any county in California to remind the fruit
growers that this is going to be a good year, to
go slow about selling fruit to speculators at lov prices
on the idea that there is going to be a big crop, as
the bear organs assert, under the pretense of booming
the county.
Joseph Moffett of Oakland says that "life is a
gloomy place" for him. It is unnecessary to call his
attention to the fact that life is a condition, rather
than a place, but so far as Moffett is concerned it
ought to be gloomy anyhow. He will be casually
remembered as one of the pessimistic gentlemen of
this community who has lately murdered a wife and
tried to kill himself. At least the community can
afford to incite the morose person to the joy born
of a realization that it is perfei . / willing to finish the
job he bungled.
Policeman Marlowe ought to be grateful for the
latest charges brought against him. If he can be
tried on them and dismissed from the force it would
save him the experience of detailing how it feels to
run away from a man who has killed your superior
officer and needs killing himself.
It is strange that some people should try to poke
fun at Colorado for its expressions of patriotism on
the ground that it is not where it could be reached
by Spanish shells. When Spanish shells begin to
fly there will be some Coloradans not far from where
they alight.
The telephone girls did not say to the earthquake,
"Line is busy; call again."
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APETL 1, 18S8.
THE pressure for removal of the Texas fever
quarantine and for raising the grazing embargo
from the mountain reservations in this State in
dicates that irrigation has narrowed the interests which
may suffer from drought. While the wheat and bar
ley crop may be shortened by a dry year, it cannot be
destroyed, and the State will have a persistent out
put. But the sheep and cattle interests, which depend
upon dry grazing until the rains bring fresh forage,
remain to be injured. The gaunt herds and bleating
flocks are a sorrow to their owners, no matter how
wide the range to which they have title. The dry
forage, which in California is of great variety and
excellence, if not cropped to exhaustion between the
last rains of one season and the first of the next, is
injured by the latter, and if they come only in quantity
to destroy and not to renew the green feed serious
loss, affecting the beef, wool and dairy interests, is
sure to follow. In this sore experience is a lesson
leading to profit, if well understood. Hardly a range
lacks soil and facilities for the artificial production of
hay. The nature of our climate permits the indefinite
carrying over, in the stack, of an unused hay crop.
In a State where stock-raising is yet and is to be al
ways a very important industry, more attention should
be given to forage crops. Even in a usually moist
season, with a normal rainfall, there is profit in feed
ing hay to cattle and sheep. They are brought through
in better condition, reproduce to a larger percentage,
make more meat and fleece, and pay a profit on the
extra cost of making hay.
A further use for the land is also indicated, and a
use profitable to the State, because it carries with it
a use for more labor.
There are rumors of herds and flocks that have al
ready lost 8o per cent in number, after costly efforts
to rescue them from famine and the buzzards. Such
a loss would cover the production of hay for many
seasons to avert it.
There is, too, a certain inhumanity in permitting
the pangs of starvation to dumb brutes when a little
foresight and a little expenditure would prevent them.
For years to come there is to be no downward
movement in the price of cattle, ani it carries the
price of sheep up with it. The exhaustion of the
great bunch grass ranges by overstocking throws the
industry back upon methods that involve the artificial
production of forage. The herdsman and the flock
master of the future must seek his profit in the preser
vation of his animals by providing fodder besides the
spontaneous growth of the ranges.
The State is a prodigal producer of natural forage,
but cultivation is limiting the ranges and must follow
the reduction in their area by substituting the forage
that is produced by cultivation.
The loss of one season's crop of cereals by drought
is reparable by the next year's normal rainfall. Only
a few months pass before ample moisture brings a
hopeful seedtime. But two seasons or three are
necessary to perfect the growth of beef cattle or bring
sheep up to their highest production of fleece and
mutton. Therefore the real loss to be felt by pro
ducer and consumer is the destruction of our meat
and wool producing animals.
MARKET-STREET PAVING.
AN esteemed contemporary remarks that if
Supervisor Dodge is correct in his conclusion
that Market street should not be reconstructed
until a modern sewer has been provided for it a great
deal of time is certain to elapse ere the thoroughfare
can be paved at all. Although this statement is made
for the purpose, as subsequently appears, of introduc
ing some weak arguments in refutation, the cyclonic
fact that Dr. Dodge is right sweeps everything be
fore it with the energy of a Nevada zephyr. How can
any rational man contend that an expensive pavement
should be laid on Market street before provision is
made for sewers, water and gas pipes and telephone
wires?
The fact that the Board of Supervisors is going
ahead to pavethe street with bitumen regardless of Dr.
Dodge's opinion proves nothing more than that it is
about to repeat an error committed a thousand times
in San Francisco â an error, indeed, which has cost
the taxpayers millions of dollars. It will avail our
contemporary nothing to argue that years would be
consumed in adopting plans for an intercepting sewer
in Market street, and that in the meantime generations
of horses and pedestrians may be dispatched by the
basalt blocks. At the end of all it can say the con
spicuous fact would still remain that a policy of pav
ing streets before the sewer builders and burrowing
corporations get through with them is perfectly
asinine. A business man found managing his affairs
in such a way would be instantly arrested and brought
before the Commissioners of Insanity.
But it is always eminently proper for the munici
pality to waste its money. It is considered really en
terprising for the Supervisors to order accepted
streets repaved with bitumen without reference to
either sewers, pipes or wires. This was done on
Stockton street, between O'Farrell and Market, last
year. The contractors laid an excellent pavement,
but they had scarcely moved their steam dissolver
away ere the Spring Valley Water Works marched
into the street and ripped it open from end to end.
The scar inflicted by this corporation can never be
eradicated. Probably other scars will be forthcoming
before long. Emissaries of the gas and telephone
companies are constantly casting covetous eyes upon
the block in question, and it is not unlikely that it
soon will be necessary to again lance it.
Notwithstanding the general public desire for the
repaying of Market street, therefore, we do not hesi
tate to affirm that the work should be preceded by
the construction of an intercepting sewer. Indeed it
is almost criminal for the Supervisors to expend the
public money in rebuilding the thoroughfare until
such a sewer has been provided for. It is long odds
that the new pavement would not be down a month
ere all the burrowing corporations, as well as the
property-owners, will be seized with an uncontrol
lable desire to repair their pipes, wires and other con
nections. The result cannot fail to be the infliction
of irreparable waste and damage.
Supervisor Dodge may be a doctor among states
men and a statesman among doctors, but that he
possesses an eminently level head on the subject of
street paving can never be disestablished.
Havana papers say the United States would back
down were Spain to refuse to consider the proposals
of this Government. It is plain at the Havana pa
pers need more than a mere censor. They need sense.
The rabid fire speakers of Congress seem still to
forget the circumstance that an American ship was
blown up in Havana harbor. But really, for a day or
two, it was a circumstance worth mentioning.
From what we know of the feeling in Texas, the
Spanish desperadoes who contemplate invasion of
that State would be wise to hunt for another spot
through which to break in.
THE DRY SEASON.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
The San Francisco Oratorio Society Is
making efforts to bring Mary Louise
Clary to this city to sing the solo role
la Salnt-Saens' "Samson et Delilah."
Miss Clary is a contralto who first be
came famous as the Trilby larynx. When
Mr! Palmer was about to produce the
Dv Maurior-Paul Potter play he sought
far and wide for a woman with sufficient i
power of lung to be heard by the whole j
house when she sang "Ben Bolt" behind
the scenes. For several days contraltos
came in processions, only to sing and be
turned away with the remark that their
voices were too feeble for the part. At
last Miss Clary came, and the very v.-in
dows of the box office vibrated when she
lifted up her voice. Palmer engaged her
on the spot, and she has been famous
ever since, partly on account of the large
amount of advertising she received for
being heard, but not seen, in "Trilby."
Miss Clary has a reputation for beauty,
and her friends say that she sings by
nature and owes little or nothing to sing
ing teachers. If this is so her voice can
not be expected to last, but she has not
been singing long enough yet to have
worn it out.
Some music by Jan Blockx is to be
played at an approaching symphony con
cert, and as a number of musical people
have already asked, "Who is Jan
Blockx?" a few words about him may
be of interest. Last year the Netherland
ish Theater of Antwerp produced a lyric
drama in the Flemish tonsrue, entitled
"Harbergsprinees" (The Princess of the
Inn). The music was by Jan Blockx and
the libretto by Nestor Tierce, both men
MARY LOUISE CLARY, Who Mag Soon Be Heard Here.
being entirely unknown to fame. The
success of their opera was so instanta
neous and startling that great critics
journeyed from as far away as Paris to
see "The Princess of the Inn," although
it was In an uncouth tongue that they
did not understand. Last year the work
was produced at other Belgian theaters,
always with the same success; finally it
was translated into French, and was pro
duced at Ghent on the 10th inst. Its re
ception was even more rapturous than
when it was played in Flemish. Le Men
estrel says of it: "The first performance,
last Friday, was a series of acclama
tions for the work, and of ovations for
the composer, who himself directed the
orchestra, and I swear that this enthus
iasm was spontaneous, and was well
merited; for the rest you know how cold
and skeptical the Belgians are, especially
in Judging the work of a compatriot. The
admiration was unanimous! Ah! for how
many years has the opera been expected
which would fulfill all aspirations, which
would be at once scholarly and emotional.
I believe that at last we have found It.
The subject is simple and naif, but it Is
human without vulgarity, and above all
it is very musical. It represents the eter
nal struggle between good and evil, be
tween sensual and Ideal love. It is a little
the history of 'Carmen' transported to
other scenes, but with a higher aim, and
is more truly lyric."
Paris, which sent us Anna Held is
shocked to the very marrow at an oper
etta that has been quite popular in Amer
ica and England. The piece that has
made Paris blush, but which is packing
the Atheneo Comlque every night, is the
"Geisha." Tt has only just been adapted,
and the critics are about equally d+vided
between horror and admiration. The se
rious critic of Le Figaro speaks of "the
prodigous indecency" of the "Geisha."
but he condones it on account of the air
of unreality given by the. Japanese setting-
He further remarks: "It is fortunate that
this piece imported from prudish England
depicts Japanese manners, for if it passed
on the European continent even the crit
ics least enslaved by 'cant' would be puz
zled to designate the place of action, and
the heroine's occupation. Fortunately it
is the who send us the 'Geisha '
for if a French author had drawn such
pictures and had depicted English society
women in such a place as the teahouse of
the Thousand Delights, we should cer
tainly have heard a wail of anguish from
the other side of the channel, declaring
that we were audaciously attributing to
chaste Albion the vices of decadent Baby
lon." Altogether the critics are having a
joyous time getting back at "perfide Al
bion," which has so often accused French
works of a laxity in morals. Paris has
not for a long time held up its hands, and
so loudly cried "shocking!"
Lyric art has lost a friend in Alphonse
Bouvret, director of the Lyric Theater,
Paris, who shot himself ontheMoulineaux
railroad, by firing four times at his brain.
No one expected such an end fee a man
whose cheerful, smiling countenance was
one of the sights of Parisian promenades.
It was when he became executor for the
Countess de Caen that Alphonse Bouvret,
in managing the estate, had charge of the
little theater in the Galerte Vivienne. At
first he played little vaudevilles there,
and then one fine day he thought he
would transform the theater into a small
opera-house, where he could revive the
cast-off works of the Opera Comique.
The success of his little house was re
markable, and the services he rendered to
French art were very real. In his hours
of ease Bouvret was a song writer and
poet, he also founded the Journal dcs Ar
tistes.
At Christiana a young Swedish pupil of
Massenet, Gaston Borch. has offered the
public a little opera in one act entitled
"Silvio," which is a sequel to Maseagni's
"Cavalleria Rusticana." Silvio, who is
the son of Lola and Turriddu, falls in love
with Graziella, the daughter of Lola and
Alflo. The young man feels that he ought
to avenge the murder of his father, killed
as all opera-goers know, by Alflo, and
something enormously tragic naturally
results. Silvio kills Alflo, and Graziella,
learning their parentage, becomes mad.
This sanguinary tragedy was very well
received by the public, and Gaston Borch
was called four times before the curtain.
The Paris Grand Opera is talking of re
viving Gluck's "Armida" next season, and
musicians are delighted with the Idea,
though the management is still hesitating
on account of the vast cost and labor in
volved. "Armida" requires such compli
cated and delicate machinery that to
stage it according to modern ideas would
involve an outlay of at least $60,000, not
to speak of costumes and other accessor
ies. If the opera is produced, it is al
ready deckled that Emma Calve shall
play the title role. Gluek's "Armlda,"
which was first produced in 1777, was
founded on an eld lyric tragedy by Lulli,
which first saw the light in 168b. For the
modern generation of opera-goers It
would be an absolute novelty.
Aloys Werner, the tenor who sang here
recently in the "Elijan," is meeting In the
East wirti an appreciation which he
scarcely received here. In Washington,
D. C, he sang the other day with marked
success, and also in Philadelphia he sang
the "Prize Song' from the " Meister
singer" with the Maennerchor, a chorus
of 200 voices, that is well known in the
East. At this sar c concert he also sang
the "Love Song" from the "Walkyrie."
During Easter week he will sing the tenor
solo part in Rossini's "Stabat Mater" in
Boston, and on Easter Sunday he is spec
ially engaged as the tenor soloist at St.
Francis Xavier's Church. New York. The
Eastern critics have devoted considerable
space to praising his singing.
The Emperor of Austria is not going to
allow any of his military bands to pay
royalties to composers, and he has shown
his hand with great firmness in the mat
ter. The other day the Society of Authors
and Composers was startled by tha res
ignation of all the composers who had
any connection with military music. It
soon transpired, however, that they had
resigned In a body i>y order of the Minis
ter of War. As if to add insult to injury,
the unfortunate soldier-composers were
ordered to matte out five varied and com
plete programmes, containing only such
pieces as can be played without any pay
ment of royalties whatever. Needless to
say, the resigning composers obeyed.
Johann Strauss, the "Waltz King," has
just opened a competition for the
scenario of a ballet, the score of
which he proposes to write him
self. The ballet is destined for the Im
perial Opera of Vienna, whose director,
Herr Mahler, is one of the five judges
that are to decide the prize of $840. The
scenario 5 must be very detailed, and the
time of its performance must not last
longer than three-quarters of an hour.
Here is a chance for American writers.
It was the irony of fate that Anton

The Emperor "William has authoi!zed

In the private office of Chief Lees out
at the City Hall is an electric button con
nected by a wire to a bell in the next
room, where the desks of his subordinates
are placei. The Chief has arranged a
series pt signals to notify his trusty ]
henchmen which particular one he de- !
sires to see and thus avoid the confusion
of having his office filled by the entire :
force, who. In times past, were wont to I
rush in in a bunch whenever they had the
slightest pretext for placing themselves In
the way to be noticed by the. man whose
favor often results in promotion.
The signals are arranged in numbers.
For instance, when Lees rings once De
tective Colby awakes from his nap and

1 that never slumbers, when the little bell is
hoard to jingle twice Tim Bainbridge cuts^^

a lost child, three bells make Dinan
heave a slph over thf possibility of work,
v.-hile four hells m^an that little Otto
i Heyneman must take his book and pen

The officials have become so accus
tomed to those signals that some of them,
upon bearing a car bell, have been known
j to leave a bar in such a hurry as to make
It necessary for the proprietor to put it
: on the slate.
Not long ago Bainbridge and Dinan
were detailed to go up the coast on a
case. They took one of the Pacific Coast
â  steamers, and after the vessel had put to
j sea and they ad succeeded in casting
about all of their bread upon the waters
i the two weary travelers retired to rest.
| The motion of the ship made slumber a
I matter of some difficulty, but at last.
i thanks to a little bottle carried by
i Bainbridge that did not contain coffee,
j they got to sleep and all was well.
Nearly two hours passed when Dinan,
springing out of his berth, began to dress
as if his life depended on the time con-
I sumed in getting nto his clothes. The
noise he made awoke his friend Tim.

It took the united efforts of the mate
and two sailors to keep him in the room
long: enough to wake up sufficiently to
comprehend the fact that he was not In
the. office, but at sea, and that the bell ha
heard was the ship's bell striking tha

Light Batteries C and F, Third Artillery, Passing in Review Before
Colonel Evan Miles.
Perhnps the all-prevailing topic, war,
had r.u.-h to do with attracting civil
ians to the Presidio yesterday to wit
ness the regular monthly inspection and
muster of troops, but whatever it was
hundreds braved the lowering skies and
the piercing winds that swept in from
the ocean during the early morning
hours, and watched the maneuvers of
the troops with liveliest interest. The
review did not differ materially from
what may be seen on the last day of
every month at the post, but where or
dinarily only a few score people Jour
ney out to the reservation to see the
display, hundreds were there yester
day.
The only feature that gave a possible
hint of the active preparations for hos
tilities now going on, was the absence
of the three batteries of heavy artil
lery. These troops ordinarily form a
part of the display, but yesterday they
were mustered in front of their quar

ately marched out to the new fortifica

REFUSED TO
BE HELD UP
C. F. Bond's Experience
With* the Gas Com
pany. "â 
His Light Cut Off Because He
Would Not Make a
Deposit.
Tho Corporation Seeks, to Arrange
the Matter, but Its Offer Is
Promptly Declined. ' .
One lesson will not suffice to correct evil
in some people, particuarly if those people
happen to be banded together in the form
of a corporation. The San Francisco Gas
Company is an instance. It might be
supposed that after the suit brought by
Henry James to recover me Soforwhichhe
had been held up, and the subsequent ex
posure in The Call of the company's Black
Bart methods, It would abandon that form
of outlawry and turn to some other means
of accomplishing the same end; but no.
It continues operations right along on the
old familiar lines, and plunders people
wherever and- whenever the opportunity
offers.
C. F. Bond is the latest victim of this
unpunished band, and he only escaped
wiiii his money because he was courage
ous and held the bandits at bay.
Mr. Bond bought tÂ»il the saloon at 3W4
Fulton street the first of the- month, ami
a week later the gas company presented
a bill for gas consumed for the month
ending March 5. Mr. Bond said he would
the former proprietor about it, and
did so that r.ight. Bond gave him suffi
cient money to pay for the gas he had
used durincr the five days, and the
former occupant paid the bill, securing

ate supervision. No time could be
spared from these works for the ordi
nary pomp and ceremony, so while the
"Johnny Doughboys," the troopers and
light artillerymen were trudging and
thundering over the big parade grounds
before the admiring eyes of the spec
tators, these men went steadily on with
their more serious work of erecting em
placements, mounting huge messengers
of destruction and otherwise preparing
for what now seems to be the inevita
ble.
Colonel Evan Miles, First Infantry,
was the reviewing officer, with First
Lieutenant Benjamin acting as brigade
adjutant. Captain Thompson, quar
termaster, and Surgeons Thompson and
TYhite, of the general staff, accompa
nied Colonel Miles. The brigade was
in command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bls
bee, First Infantry.
At 9:30 o'clock the splendid band and
field music of the First Infantry march
ed onto the plain and took station on
the right of the line marked out by the
Signal Corps. Then came the infan
try, a superb body of men as precise
a receipt for the money, which he gave to
Bond.
Last Friday Mr. Bond received notice
that unless he deposited $S with the com
pany at once, his gas would be turned off.
He refused to submit to this extortion,
and his meter was taken away.
Mr. Bond went to the office and showed
i by his receipt that he did not owe any
| thing, and requested to have the meter
j put in again. But the person whom he
I saw told him that unless he put up the
$8 he could not have any gas. Mr. Bond
; explained that he was a business man
| and expected to pay his bills on demand.
Though a private citizen, he was as hon
est as the corporation that sought to rifle
his pockets. He said he did not propose
to give the company the use of JS indefi
nitely without interest, but he was will
ing to give ample security for the amount.
; He had a prominent business man with
: him, a man who is rated in the millions,
i who offered to be responsible, but the re-
I ply was. "No coin, no gas."
Mr. Bond became exasperated at this
barefaced attempt to hold him up, and,
remarking that the company might be
consumed in its own gas for all he cared,
purchased a supply of lamps and returned
to his place to arrange for lighting it
with oil. The lady who owns the prem
ises learned of her tenant's predicament
and going to the office offered to make
the deposit good herself. This suited the
company, and late that afternoon one of
its employes was sent out to put the me-
I ter back and turn on the gas.
But Mr. Bond had done all the business
| with the San Francisro Has Company he
cared to. and refused to allow the man to
set up the meter. The company evidently
realise* thr.t it has met a man who
1 is fully prepared to defend himself, and
fearing it may be haled into court again
is seeking to square itself, but Mr. Bond
will continue to use his lamps and is con
' pidering what is the best course to
pursue. __^_^_^^___
ICE COMPANIES
READY TO FIGHT
The Price of the Commodity

! National and Union Concerns Are
Prepared to Meet the Mutual's
Rates.
The fijrht betwen the three Ice com
panies that are doing business in this
city, (ha Mutual, National and Union,
will be <.n in earnest to-day, April 1.
The two latter intend to meet any cut
that has lr-en made or may be made by
the Mutual, and solicitors were out all
over town yesterday trying to keep cus
tomers in line and prevent loss of busi
ness, as it was placed before the ice war
began. Before the split in the ice trust
took place, the price of ice was universal
ly $6 a ton, but when the dissensions
caused a rupture the Mutual Company
cut the price to $5 a ton.
The National and Union companies are
prepared to meet this reduction, and. if
it becomes necessary, to make even a
lower figure to hold their customers they
will do so. It was intimated by solicitors
yesterday that the price of ice might
even go to $4 a ton unless the representa
tives of the three concern* agree to get
together and stop the war of prices.
All three of the concerns mm immense
plants here and in the Sterna and a
combination of any two m-ill be likely to
force the third out bf the market. In
the meantime the saloons and restaurants
about town where ice is used in largo
quantities will profit by the difficulties

Haynes Commenced Yesterday
Before Judge Conlan.
The 'preliminary trial of Theodore Park
Haynes, the old tinker, who shot and
killed Lieutenant W. F. Burke on the
morning of March 23 at the corner of
Montcalm street and Peralta avenue,
where the officer attempted to arrest him
for having fired at his neighbor, Alfred

Judge Conlan in Police Court No. 2 at
11 o'clock yesterday morning. The trial
consumed both the morning and after

was adjourned until this afternoon.
The prisoner was represented by Edwin
Sweeney and J. N. E. Wilson, while At
torney E. P. Mogan conducted the prose
cution. The prisoner frequently Interrupt
ed the cross-examination with statements
of the case.
By the evidence of Hopkinson It was
shown that Officers Marlowe. Merchant,
Wilkinson and Kennedy acted in a cow
ardly manner by not going to the assist
ance of the wounded officer. It appeared
from the evidence of \Hopkinson, as wel!
as from that of Mrs. Mary Callen, who
lived just across the street, that the offi
cers scattered at the first sight of danger.

It was shown that none of the officers
was near to render his superior any
assistance. From a distance they blazed
away at the cabin in a heroic attempt
to make a wing shot and bag the en
raged tinker, who was successfully keep
ing them at bay and behind their shelter.
Hopkinson's testimony, In the main, was
descriptive of the animosity that had ex
isted between himself and Haynes as a
result of a long standing dispute regard
ing the line that separated their lots. His
testimony of the origin of the quarrel of
that day was substantially the same as
was published in The Call at the time of
the murder.
Mrs. Callen testified to seeing Lieuten
ant Burke go up to Haynes and show him
the star upon his coat, and then to hav

prosecution was assisted by Detective
C. J. Cody. The case will be resumed be

DEATH OF MBS. H. F. EMERIC.
The Wife of the Well-Known Fish
Commissioner Passes Away.
Death has robbed San Francisco of one
of its charming native daughters and
mado vacant a place in the home of
Henry F. Emeric, the well-known and
popular Fish Commissioner. Deceased
had been a patient sufferer for years, a
portion of which she spent in traveling
through Europe in search of health.
While in jraris a consultation of eminent
physicians was held, with the view of
having an operation performed, for which
Paris physicians wanted $30.iM) in ad
vance. Mr. Emeric was willing to pay
the fee, but his wife objected, preferring
to spend the amount with her borne phy
tered. Meanwhile the mounted troops
went down the reviewing line again,
this time at a sharp trot, field pieces
and caissons bounding and scabbards
clanking. That closed the spectacular
display, for the men were drawn up in
line while their arms and accouter
ments were inspected, and after they
were dismissed.
The Inspection was not ended, how
ever, for the officers made a tour of tha
barracks and stables, examining thÂ»
quarters of man and beast, with min
ute care. As usual, everything was
found in excellent condition and Colonel
Miles pronounced himself as being well

Professor Ruiz, Who Was Retired,
Causes a Mutiny Among tha
Scholars.
The dropping from the rolls of the
school department of Professor C. A.
Ruiz, teacher of Spanish in the Commer
cial Business Evening School, threatens
to cause a mutiny among the pupils of
the class he formerly taught.
Professor Ruiz's class was consolidated
â with that of a teacher of Spanish in the
Humboldt Evening School, but the pro
fessor's former pupils declare they will
not study under the new teacher, ana will
refuse to attend school unless their favor
ite teacher is reinstated.
Professor Ruiz had thirty-three scholars
ia his class, twenty-six of whom have
signed a petition to the Board of Edu
cation demanding that their former in
structor be returned to his place. They
claim that their new tutor can be taught
Spanish by some of the professor's pupils,
and that she is not competent to teach
the language as it should be taught. They
also claim that Professor Ruiz has a high
school certificate as a teacher, while his
successor has none.
THte disgruntled pupils will bring the
matter to the attention of the Board of
Education at its next meeting.

with terrific force upon Durand's head.
Durand fell to the floor, bleeding pro
fusely from the woun'l in his head, and
Carney fled.
The ambulance was summoned and
Durand was taken to the Receiving
Hospital. Drs. Thcipson and Winter
berg found that his skull was frac
tured for about three inches, and, as he
had bled profusely, they feared he
might die. Dur-nd was pieced under
an anesthetic and the skull was tre
phined and a piece about three inches
long was removed.
Policeman F. W. Smith was attracted
to the scene by f.ie crowd that had as
sembled in front of Durand's place of
business. By the time he reached
there Carney had disappeared. He took
possession of the iron bar and went to
the Southern police station with it and
reported the assault. Captain Spillane
at once issued instructions to tho offi
cers in the Southern district to keep a
sharp lookout for Carney and arrest
him on sight.
Carney has been mixed up In several
scrapes for the last eight or nine years.
In 1891 he was the proprietor of a
saloon at 427 Pacific street, and in
April was arrested for robbery. He
beat the case in the Superior Court.
Since then he has been arrested at dif
ferent times for minor offenses. He has
occupied the position of deputy in the
Superintendent of Streets' department,
and has recently been employed as a
substitute Deputy Sheriff. He has been
haunting the police courts, and the
police say that he has been using his
political influence to "square" cases for
his friends in the courts.
Kearney was arrested last night by
Policeman Conlon and charged with an
assault to commit murder. He refused to
make a statement, except to say that lie
was sorry that "the Frenchman"
was not dead. On account of the serious
condition of his victim Captain Spillane
refused to admit him to bail.
Kearney when locked up in the City
Prison showed traces of having been on
a protracted debauch.
To a friend who visited him in his cell
he declared that his victim had attacked
him with a hatchet, and to protect him
self ho struck him over the head with the
iron bar.
DIAMONDS ON THE DEAD.
Body of an Unknown Man Supposed

METAIRE FIRST
AT LONG ODDS
Walters Took the Gentle
men's Race With the
Outsider.
Favorites Were Successful in
the Other Five
Events.
Formero Again a Winner â Speedy
O'Connell Played With
His Field.
The race for gentlemen riders was the
only bright effect of an otherwise dull
and featureless card at Ingleside yester
day, Metalre, a M to 1 shot, ridden by
Mr. Walters. an unknown quantity,
turned up the winner. In the opening
betting. Our Climate, the mrm-t of Mr.
Haines. was chalked up favorite at odds j
of f> to 5. later receding to 11 to 5. Mr.
Haines w;;.s unfortunate in retting left
at the post. William O"B. piloted by Mr.
Dunphy, had first call around, bugle call,
at odds of Bto 5. Many pinned their faith
in Mr. Skinner, who threw the leg over
Don Clafendo. At the start. Mr. Walters
pallied out in the lead with Metalre, and
though it was freely prophesied that the
outsider would back up. he failed to do
it. eventuaJly winntne by four lengths.
By nuking a short turn into the stretch
and a liberal application of the "bat" Mr.
Skinner succeeded in beating William
OB out for the place.
Favorites had it all their -way, the
grentlemen riders" race bedng the only one.
to go to an outsider in the betting. The
fields were small and very close odds
were laid a-grUst the different winner?.
H. L. Frank started his aristocratically
bred colt Bitter Root in the opening six
furlong spin, for which fourteen three
year-old maidens went to the post. The
brown feJlov,- backed up in the betting
from 6 to 5 to twos, and won all the way,
finishing at the end four lengths before
the 15 to 1 chance Toribio. Kroica was
a good third.
Tom Cook took the seven furlong selling
run with Break o' Day. The mare was
a 3 to 2 favorite in the ring, and intrust
ing the front position to Tim Murphy
until straightened for home, drew away,
winning very handily In 1:2S 34.3 4 . sir Dilke
the second choice, outflelded old Tim for
the plaoe.
The good colt Formero upheld his rep
utation by taking the five furlong
scramble for two-year-olds as he pleased
in the fast time of 1:01 1Â». The son of Con
veth was held an even money choice In
the ring, and ltÂ«i Olinthus out with con
siderable in reserve. Milt Young was
beaten but a nose for the place.
Barney Schreit.cr scratched Dr. Marks
from the mile and a furlong and the
crowd then jumped on R"d Glenn, forcing
Ills odds down from twos tn even money.
"Skeets" Martin kept Purser's gelding
back in the race until the stretch was
reached, where he set sail for Daylight,
and at the wire won cleverly by a length.
The hitter Becured the place from Melvin
Burnhara in a drive.
O'Conne'.l disposed of his company in
the flnai seven furlong run very impres
sively. Starting a 1 to 2 favorite, the old
sprinter Up-toed in front from the start
winning easily a length In advance of
Rosormonde. St. Catallne gave the win
ner a rub for part of the distance, but
tired as the wire waa approached.
TRACK ITEMs,
The Judges yesterday notified J. A. Gray, the
owner of Hennoso. that he would have to pro
duce the coin he was paid when his colt was
claimed from a . race on Monday last, by 4
O'clock this afternoon or lose h!s horse.
Joe Plggott rode imp. Bitter Root, it being
his first appearance in the colors of his new
employer. H. L. Frank, the wealthy Montana
horseman. â ':;â¢:;"â¢;.
.Arhaces. a full brother to Sutton, I'isrg-s and
OHnthua, was a starter In the maiden event.
He made a Rood showing toward the end, but
is far from l.eing the equal of his illustrious
brother. P;crs.
There was a time when Henry Shields could
beat the barrier, hut he seems to have lost
the knack altogether of late.
The ride Conley put up on Sir DUke might
get him medals In the Middle West country,
but such kind will never get him elected to the
Legislature in this State. He was endowed
with entirely too much patience. .
A number of the Derby candidates were sent
the route yesterday morning. Torsldia was

All Committees Actively at Work for
the Masonic Festival.
The wives of the pnst masters and mas-
I ters of Fidelity Lodge assembled at King
| Solomon's Hall yesterday afternoon and |
'â  mapped a line of work that Is likely to ,
I bring in thousands of dollars for the ben- \
I efit of tho Widows' and Orphans' Home
at Decoto. The Rev. Dr. Voorsanger ex- I
plained to the ladies the object for which I
they were assembled and told them to de- j
cide in their own way exactly what they '
thought best for the Interest of all.
Among the ladies present were Mrs. ;
Voorsanger, the Misses Voorsanger, Mrs.
S. Rosener. Miss Nettie Rosener, Mrs. G. j
I Brenner, Mrs. A. Mannar and Mrs. Dr. !
Kahn. It was decided that Fidelity '
Lodge should get up its own booth and !
I work as a body.
Mrs. Dr. S. S. Kahn was unanimously ;
j elected chairman and Miss Rosener secre- i
: tary. In committee of the whole the la- j
; dies decided to appoint an executive com- j
mittee of twelve. The executive commit- â 
| tee Is composed of Mrs. Schlesinger, Mrs. j
IS. Rosener, Mrs. Gambits, Mrs. H. S.
'â  Monheim, Mrs. Dr. Voorsanger, Mrs. W. :
L. Mack, Mrs. Gustav Brenner, Mrs. !
\ Fred Barry. Mrs. George Liebold, Mrs. (
A. Armer, Mrs. I. Levin and Mrs. J. W.
i Ellis.
The ladies are going to arrange what
j they call a "Monte Carlo." It promises
i to be a very Interesting place and one !
| that will be Inexpensive to reach. The
expense of leaving will depend on the >
ladies and gentlemen who visit "Monte
Carlo."
The executive committee will meet at !
1 the house of Mrs. Dr. Kahn, ISO 4 Sutter
| street, next Monday afternoon.
Fidelity Lodge will also be represented
I in possibly the most unique way by Mrs.
, Nathan Schlesinger. This lady proposes
i of her own free will and at her own cx
i pense, to have a booth devoted to music
and arts. fcMie will show living pictures.
The scenes will be secured from the Tiv
! oli, Baldwin and Columbia theaters. At
least iifiy pretty girls will participate.
Mrs. Schlesinger will furnish the music
at her own expense.
While the ladies were holding their
meeting word came from Oakland and
Alamena that the ladies of the Eastern
Star chapters were getting together in
order to have thoir own booths. Mrs. H.
D. Howe, the matron of Oak Leaf Chap
ter No. S, is working with the other
ladles.
The committee on booths held a meet
: ing and decided to enlarge the plan of ac- j
tiori so that the entire ground floor of the
Pavilion will be used. If the people south â 
<â¢â ( Fresno decide to come to thÂ«* city ami
got space tor booths the upper portion of
the Pavilion will have to be fitted up.
Since Grand Walter Flint Issued his of- !
â  ficial sanction Masons In the Interior are
raphing an account of donations,
i tc, which means that the festival will
be a financial success.
On Trial for Embezzlement.
A. Ctumaaaa, who is accused of having
embezzled $2770 BO belonging to the Italian
Benevolent Society, was placed on trial
yesterday before a Jury in Judge Vv'al
lace's court. i
THE SAX FRAKCISCO CALL, FHIDAY, APRIL 1, 1898.
ARGUMENTS IN
THE HOFF CASE
Attorney Baker Presents His
Views to the Trial
Jury.
Scathing Insinuations as to the Guilt :
of (he Man on Trial for
His Life.
Arguments In the Hoff case were opened
yesterday afternoon. Attorney George .
W. Baker made the opening remarks. He '
was followed by Attorney Simpson for the
defense. The case will probably go to
the Jury this afternoon.
During the morning session witnesses i
were examined by the prosecution for the
purpose of contradicting the testimony
gicen by Hoff that Detective Seymour had
used threatening and vulgar language at
the time he made his statement to the
police concerning his employment in the
residence of the murdered woman on the
day of her tragic death.
Otto H. Heynemann, reporter for the
Chief of Police, testified that no vulgar
or threatening language was used. He
was corroborated by Chief Lees and De
tective Seymour.
Judge Cook rebuked Attorney Schooler
of the prosecution for the manner in
which witnesses were examined.
S. M. Ewing and Arthur Barendt, of the
Examiner, swore that the testimony given
by Hoff in regard to the Seymour mat
ter was untrue, and their evidence was
strengthened by L. G. Carpenter of the !
Tost.
After lunch Attorney Baker reviewed
the case for an hour and a half. He i
spoke of the helplessness of the victim
and the brutality of the murderer. After
he had argued for some time to the effect '
that the matter of time, which was so i
thoroughly gone Into, was not material
to the case, he was asked by Attorney
Schooler to explain his Ideas of a motive
for the murder.
Then the accusations against the pris
oner came In vehement utterances. "Mo
tive?" said Attorney Baker. "I will ex- j
plain the motive of the drunken wretch. :
He has stated that the ladles always
smile on him. He has denied nothing
in the case with the exception that he :
struck the fatal, brutal blows. Without ;
doubt he was with Mrs. Clute between |
the hours of 4 and 5 on the afternoon of
December 15, and because he was nui
able to gain his purpose, anger overcamo
him and he crushed the skull of a help
less woman. It was a criminal act of a
fiend incarnate with an object in view of |
outraging his victim. That was his mo- .
tive, and the scoundrel murdered Mrs. '
Clute, and no juror can doubt it. The j
defense have seen fit to attack the police, ;
but without the police and the way in '
which they do their duties our lives or the
lives of our families would not be safe
with such monsters as that abroad in
the land."
During the argument Mr. Clute, who
was present in the court room, cried bit
terly, but from time to time he listened
to the argument and watched the move
ments of the man aroused of having mur
dered his v,-if<-.
Archibald Clavering Gunter Here.
Archibald Clavering Gunter, the author
of "Mr. Potter of Texas." 'Mr. tfames of
New York" and a half-dozen other works
that have served to pass the time at all
the watering places of the world and to
make pleasant many a long and tedious
journey by land and sea. is at the Grand,
where he arrived, with his wife, Wednes
day night from New York.
Mr. Gunter Is only here on a visit to his
mother, Who resides in the city, and after
a stay of four or five weeks will return
to New York, where he is engaged in the
business of turning out, through the me
dium of a publishing house, the products
of other genius, as well as erni oying his
spare moments in giving to the world new
creations of his own.
Mr. Gunter is much interested In the
Cuban question, and says that from the
observations he maJe in the different sec
tions of the country through which he
passed on his way out her*- it seems as if
the whole nation was aflame, and that
unless Spain backs down it looks a-s
though she would get the whipping she
so richly deserves.

The wreck of the schooner Bobolink on
the co&at of Memioolno, on the 24th inst.,
was a most peculiar one. The vessel
called out with a land breeze, and when
the wind fell light, the captain dropped
his kedge anchor. When the wind came
up again and the sails filled the captain
waited a few minutes in order to get in
the anchor, and that delay was fatal.
A squall struck the schooner and drove
her Inshore. Then before anything could
be done to save her she was hard and
fast In a natural co\e between two rocks.
The force with which sh'Â» went ashore
tore nearly 'he entire bottom out of her,
but to look at her as she now lies in
smooth water no one would ever think
but she was lying at anchor ready to
discharge her cargo. The cargo will be
saved, but the wreck of the vessel is now
"For sale at a sacrifice."
Mrs. Peterson, wife of the second mate
of the steamer Gypsy, was treated at the
Harbor Receiving Hospital early yester
day morning for carbolic acid poisoning.
The unfortunate woman is a confirmed
eplritualist, and at a seance last Sunday
night she was told that she was going
to die of consumption. She preferred a
quicker death, and tried to swallow car
bolic acid, but only managed to swallow
a very small portion of It. Her tongue
and lips were badly burned, but yesterday
afternoon she was able to go to her home,
at 113 Trenton street. At the hospital
6he gave the name of Mamie Ruggles.

The Sacramento and Ran Jnaquin rivers
Bre now lower than they have been at â 
any time in the months of February and

ranchers along the banks of the two riv

the dredgers are at work building up the
breaks that may have been caused during,
the winter. This year, however, no strain
whatever has been put on the levees, and
the rivers an 1 so low that it is a common
occurrence for the steamers to be from
from one to three hours late on the way
up or down the rivers. Yesterday morn-
Ing the steamer J. D. Peters stuck for
an hour and a half, and the Mary Garratt
â was in a similar predicament. If the ves
h-1s are getting stuck in. the mud this
early in the year, what will be the con
dition of affairs when th<> summer is well
advanced? The consensus of opinion
seems to be that the steamers will not
be able to get within several miles of
Stockton, and that the passengers will

At a meeting of the Harbor Cominla
sioners yesterday Chief Wharfinger Root
recommended that the Naval Militia
training-ship Marion be at once moved
into the stream. He said tnat on account
of the crowded condition of the wharves
the space was badly needed for the time
being for the purposes of commerce.
Commissioner Harney objected to the re
moval of the vessel on the ground that it
would be putting the Naval Reserve to a
great deal of inconvenience and to un
necessary expense. He also held that the
space occupied by the warship is not of
very much use anyhow. The matter went
over for a week.
Campbell Eros, were awarded the con
tract for putting up the office buildings
on Folsom-street wharf. P. J. â  O'Neill
was awarded the contract for painting
the same. The Mutual Electric Light
Company was awarded the contract for

tire water front for one year.
Three of the cabin boys on the steamer

them ashore they ran get $45 a thousand
for tJiem at Panama. Three of them got
aehore at Panama with a thousand of
them, but were followed by the Custom
House officers. Two of them dropped their
packages and made their escape. The
third one showed fight and was arrested
for resisting an officer and attempting to
smuggle. He was given twenty-four
hours in the stocks and fined $20. The
stocks are an olfl-fashfoned affair and

year? ago. The unfortunate cabin boy
with his legs and arms through four
holes had to stand the jibes of every pasV
ser-by for twenty-four hours. He was
more than glad when his puntshnient was
over. The other boys on the steamer had
to raise a subscription in order to pay
the $20 fine for him, and it is safe to say
that the boys on that ship will not
smuggle again in a hurry.
By order of the Navy Department the
monitor Monadnock will proceed to the
scene of the wreck of the Helen W.Almy

derelict and thus remove a menace to

that purpose was sent down from Mare
Island last night and placed on board the
monitor, and it is expected that the
Monadnock will start on its mission of
destruction this morning.

SURVEYOR -GENERAL J. M. GLEAVES.
Senator James M. Gleaves, recently appointed United States Surveyor-
General for California by President McKinley, formally took possession of
the office in the Sub-Treasury building yesterday. The transfer was made
without much displr--. the retiring Surveyors-General, Will S. Green, simply
calling his force of clerks and employes into the reception room and intro
ducing them to the hew head of the department, the latter having previ
ously presented his credentials from the President.
As a silent welcome to the newly appointed official several large and
beautiful bouquets of roses were placed on the desks of the two principal
offices. With the expressed welcome to Senator Gleaves the office force
also presented their well-wishes to the retiring head and his accommodat
ing chief clerk, F. P. Harden, who will voluntarily leave the position he has
held so long. With the exception of the heaj of the department, the clerkb
and other employes are under civil service, but it is the custom for the chief
clerk to retire with his superior. Mr. Harden will be succeeded by the Sur
veyor-General's son, James M. Gleaves Jr. This is the only change that
will or can be made, but it is rumored that there may be a resignation in
one of the departments, in which case a promotion will follow.
Senator Gleaves is well known to the public in general. He was elect
ed State Senator in 1895 from the Second Senatorial District, which is one
of the largest in the northern part of the State. He has identified himself
prominently with the project of dredging the large rivers, particularly the
Sacramento, and has been to Washington three times in the interest of the

hts wife complained to the police on Mon
day that Kellan had been using vulgar
language toward their daughter Edith, 14
years of age, and had made offensive pro
posals to her.
Yesterday afternoon Henkells sent
Edith with a message, and in looking but
of the window he saw a man talking to
her. When she returned to the house he
asked her who the man was and what
he had been saying. to her. She told him
that he was the same man who had been
talking to her on Monday. Henkells at
once seized his revolver, and going out
of the house went up to Kelian, who
was standing: In front of his residence,
and charged him with endeavoring to
ruin his daughter. Henkells, without fur
ther parley, opened fire on Kellan, and
.fired five shots at him, but none took ef
fect. The policemen came upon the scene
â¢and further hostilities were stopped..
After Henkells a!nd the girl, who ac
companied her father to the Southern
Police Station, had told their stories to
Captain Spillane. he was taken before
Judge Conlan, and the Judge, after hear
ing the circumstances of the case, wrote
out an order for the release of Henkells
on. his own recognizance. Henkells was
taken to the City Prison, and after being
booked on the charge of assault to mur
der, was immediately released on the
order of Jtulgp Conlan.
Kelian had also been taken to theprison,
and after consultation with the Judge, he
was booked on a charge that will prevent
him from getting his liberty for some
considerable time. He is a married man,
and an engineer by trade.
lUate last night Kelian complained of a
pain in his right side, and Prison Ser
geant Bibwlll, thinking he might have re
ceived one of the bullets fired at him,
ordered him taken to the Receiving Hos
pital. Dr. Tormey, who examined him,
found that he had been slightly wounded
Jn the side, the bullet grazing the flesh.
After being treated for the wound Kel
ian discovered a bullet in his shoe. He
seemed elated over his narrow escape
from being killed, and laughingly de
clared that he bore a charmed life.

KIDNAPERS
ARRESTED
Wholesale Stealing of
Women in China
town.
The ChinesÂ© Consul Ap
peals to the Chief of
Police.
Threatened to Kill One of Their
Victims if She Made an
Outcry.
DRIVEN TO SAN JOSE.
Two WhlU Men Art Acoutud of
Standing In With the Ab
el uotors.
Chief LÂ«es Is determined to stop the
wholesale kidnaping of Chinese women.
During the past few weeks at least half a
dozen Chinese women nave been abducted
and taken out of the city. Last night a
representative of the Chinese Consul vis
ited police headquarters and invoked the
aid of- Chief Lees in ferreting out the
men who are guilty of the outrages. Ac
curding to the story several highbinders,
assisted by two white men. abducted the
wumen. The highbinders are well known
and will be arrested to-day. Just who
the white men are the police refuse to
Bay. It is known, however, that one of
them is a hack driver, and it Is likely that
he will also be arrested.
The first Intimation that a gang of kid
napers existed In Chinatown was when a
rather pretty Chinese girl was missing
from her home on Jackson street, near
Dupont. Thinking that the girl had run
away, her alleged father visited the office
of the Chief of Police and invoked his
aid in finding her. Chief Lees detailed
t\\ ' of nis best men on the case, and at
ttr a thorough investigation, they re
â i that, the girl had been kidnaped
l>> two highbinders, assisted by a white
li.uk driver.
A few days later another Chinese girl
was reported missing, and as it was
known that she had been in the company
of. a notorious highbinder oh the day of
her disappearance, the conclusion was
lied that she had been abducted. By
dint of inquiry the detectives learned that
bad been decoyed from her home on
the pretense that a, friend wished to see
her. As she reached the trysting place
she was Belated by -two' highbinders, who
threatened to kilt her, It she made an
outcry, and forced ncr. to enter a car
riag-e which was in waiting. Sne was
thti, driven to the Tremont lodging-house
on Kearny street, where she was held a
: t>r for â â several' days. One of her
captors constantly stood guard over her,
frequently covering her with a murder
ous-looking revolver in order to intimi
date her. Evidently satisfying them
selves i hat there was no further danger
of police interference, the highbinders
managed to get her out of the house un
known to the landlady or occupants. She
was then placed in a hack and driven to
the ferry, wh.-re her abductors bought
tickets tor Colusa. After reaching there
th>- girl was turned over to a Chinese
merchant, who had evidently paid a large
sum for her. Learning of the abduction
another Chinese, who conducted a mer
chandise storÂ« in Colusa, Informed the
police of that town, with the result that
the girl was rescued and sent back to
this city. A short time afterward the
highbinders stole another girl, and plac
ing her in a hack, drove her to San Jose
where she was sold to a Chinese mer
chant. The hackman who drove her to
the Garden City is supposed to be in
cahoots with the highbinders, and as he
is known the detectives have concluded
to swear out a warrant for his arrest to
day, as they. believe that he had a hand
in abducting the girl.
WAS EJECTED
FROM THE CAR
Thomas L. Hill Sues the Sutter-
Street Railway Company
and Wins.
Presented a Transfer, Which a Con
ductor on tha Road Refused
to Accept.
On December 27 last Thomas L. Hill, a
dentist, boarded an easthound Sutter
Btreet car, and having j,iid his fare re
ceived from the conductor a transfer
ticket entitling him to continue his lour
ney upon the intersecting car lines at
Polk street, both lines being operated by
the same company.
Upon arriving at Polk str*f after a
delay of about two minutes Hill boarded
the first southbound Larkin street car
which arrived after he left the Suu'er
street car and sealed himself therein. At
the same time Thomas Martin, a stranger
to Hill, also seated himself in the sa.me
car. When the car neared the corner of
I-arkln and Post streets the conductor
named Luckenback, demanded his fare
and Hill handed him the transfer ticket
received by him from the conductor of
the Sutter street car. Luckenback, upon
receiving the ticket, looked at his watch
and informed Hill that he would have to
pay/another fare, as his transfer was
"no good."
After explaining to the conductor that
he had JuKt received the transfer from
the conductor of the Sutter street line,
that it was a good transfer ticket and'
that he would not pay another fare, he
was told that unless he did pay another
fare he would have to get off the car.
This both Hill and Martin refused to do.
the transfer of the latter being similar
to that of Hill.
Thereupon the conductor called to his
aid the gripman. named Cutler, who as
sisted the conductor in ejecting Hill from
the car.
Subsequently. on January 12, Hill,
through his attorney, L. E. Phillips,
brought suit In the Justice Court for the
Hum of $299 as damages, which action
was tried before Justice G. W. F. Cook,
who yesterday rendered judgment
against the Hutter Rtreet railroad for the
Bum of $40 and all costfl of suit.
GUNTER IS HEBE.
The Novelist Revisits Early Friends
and Scenes.
Archibald flavoring Gunter of New
York is in San Francisco, accompanied
by his wife. He came across the conti
nent ns speedily as possible, and had just
settled himself for a night's rest at the
Palace Hotel, when the earthquake en
gaged his attention, -.r. Gunter, as a
loyal Californlan. ciistinctly remembers
the earthauake of ISCS. and declines to he
disturbed by the forty-second temblors of
this decade.
Coming across the continent Mr. Gunter
Had an opportunity to judge of the senti
ment of the country on the question of
war with Spain, and ascertained that the
fueling ia almost universal in favor of a
conflict. "Wai! street, contrary to public
impression. 2s ready for war." said Mr
Gunter. "The bankers and brokers say
'Let us fight it out, and bo over with It!' "
Mr Gunter is m very successful writer
of books and a successful publisher of his
own and other people's works. He has
gained a large sum of money from the>
products of his Imagination and the notes
of his observation. He has accumulated
also some amplitude of form, so be is no
longer lithe, slender and willowy. Speak
ing of the salable quality of his books,
he says that "Mr. Barnes of New York

TO EXTEND BUSH STREET.
Property Owners in : the Richmond j
District Will Co-operate With :.
the Anti-Bouleyardists. â¢. :
The determined fight made by the ma- ;
jority of the property owners on Bush
street to prevent that thoroughfare from !
being declared a boulevard has brought to j
their assistance the Richmond residents. J
The movement now on foot is to have the I
street cut through Laurel Hill Cemetery,
and by this means tap th--. R chmond dis
trict. The loss, if any, to. the cemetery,
would be but trifling in comparison to the
benefits gained by. the Ricnmond people.
This is what prompts them to co-operate i
with the Bush street property owners In i
asking: for this concession from the direc- : '
tors of the cemetery and also from the !
Supervisors.
At the next meeting of the Point Lobos !
Improvement Club action will be taken !
looking to this acquisition for the benefit j
of the entire section lying west of Central '
avenue.- As It is now. the only- street over j
which travel can be had to the Richmond ;
district is over Geary street. By cutting l
Bush street through It will lead directly j
into the center of the district and connect i
with First avenue, which has lately been i
bituminized from the Presidio to Golden i
Gate Park.
The additional support of the Polk- i
street Improvement Club is ' promised to
this movement. The merchants on this
street claim tha.. Bush street is the only
street by which they can directly reach
the business portion of the city. To shut
this off from them means to 'send them
round by Pacific street, a distance of two
miles, with an inferior grade.
The extending of the street through the
cemetery meets with the approval of the !
Polk-street Club, as it will be the means
of tapping Richmond and bringing a por
tion of the trade into Polk street.
This club will make a determined effort
before the Supervisors to have provision I
made in the next contract for lighting
the streets by which the principal streets
of the city will have electric lights sus
pended over the center of the streets, as
was done last year. In this movement
Polk street was the leader, and the other
streets followed, until all of the principal !
business streets In the city became il- I
luminated.
The extension of Bush street will give
a direct opening into California street
west of Central avenue via Cliff street,
a small street of no consequence as a
thoroughfare 'as it is. but which, when
joined to Bush street, will become a lead-
Ing avenue between the eastern and west
ern portions of the city.

men to find the culprit. ; \
Last ni^ht Butler was seen riding a
bicycle along Market street. A young
man who lives' in Oakland recognized
him, and* summoning a police officer, he
ordered him to arrest him. Just then-
Butler fell from his wheel, but before
the officer could reach him the supposed
thief remounted his machine and rode
away. Subsequently the young man vis

CHURCH PEOPLE
WILL REUNITE
Preparations Being Made in
Anticipation of St. Pat
rick's Bazaar.
A Mooting Is Hold and Officers Ap
pointed to Arrange trio Pre
liminaries.
Every effort is being madÂ© by the
clergy, and those of the laity appointed
to the task of arranging the preliminaries
of the coming bazaar to be held next Sep
tember in aid of the building fund of St.
Patrick's Church, to make the coming
event a success.
As this is the first time that public
charity has ever been asked or solicited
by this, the oldest parish church in the
city, it is expected that for this reason
alone the old edifice on Mission street
should be patronized and assisted. The
church needs repairing and the house
adjoining, the residence of thÂ« clergy,
is actually crumbling with decay. It is
to make the needed repairs and put the
church and parochial residence in a pre
sentable condition that the bazaar is to
be held.
The most representative meeting ever
held by the gentlemen of the parish took
place Friday evening, being called by
Father Brennan for the purpose of stim
ulating an interest in the coming bazaar
among the young men of the parish He
encouraged them by telllner them that
the ladies of the parish were working
and makine every effort to make the
coming event a success, and in consider
ation of this he expected them to take
an active interest in the affairs of that
church.
T. L. Doran was elected chairman and
James F. O'Brien secretary.
To carry out the wishes of Father
Brennan, the chairman, Mr. Doran called
a special meeting for this evening to map
out a decisive course of action and to
show that the eentlcmen of the parish
are taking an interest in the bazaar. It
was decided that the committee should
take hold of the Annual reunion of par
ishioners and their friends and that they
should ask all the gentlemen of the parish
to help to make the reunion a success
El Campo was selected as the place 'for
the reunion because it is easily accessible
and because persons can come and go at
convenience, as special steamers have
been chartered for the day. They will
make trips to suit all.
Saturday, May 21st, has been selected
for the outing, as on Saturday it is easier
for the gentlemen to leave work than on
any other week day.
The members of the committee of ar
rangement wore appointed as follows-
J. M. Lynch. W. Fitzgerald, Thomas

A HOWL FROM NOE VALLEY.
Residents Indignant Over the Ac-
tion of the School Directors on
Scnool Accommodation.
Indignant woujd be a mild phrase to
use In connection with the feelings or the
residents of Noe Valley when they read
in yesterday morning's Call the action
taken by the School Directors on the pr>
vious evening regarding school accommo
dation for tne c.^dren of that section of
the city.
By a careful canvass of the district *y
ing west of Castro street, and known as
Noe Valley, it was ascertained that ' -ere
are 400 children of school age for which
there is no accommodation in the build
ing known as the School.
This representation has been made to
the School Directors for more than one
year, and yet notning has been done to
remedy the evil.
The residents of the valley asked that
a tolerably fair building at the corner of
Hoffmajr avenue and Twenty-fifth street
might be temporarily rented until such
time as the next annual ta_x levy should
be made, when a proper school building
could be erected for the wan. s. of that
portion of the city, which is a; growing
one, and in which the increase of children
would justify the expenditure.
Even this humble request, was refused,
and by it the 400 school children are de
prived of an education..'' -..':â â¢ â '. -.- - :
From the present temper of the resi
dents of the west of Castro street it may.
be expected, that at the next meeting of
the improvement, club of this district
some warm speeches may .be heard in . re

plary" Directors, who have the manage
ment of the schools of this city in their

THE AUDITOR ENJOINED.
Restrained by Suit From Signing the
Demands of the County Clerk's
.Deputies. . ;
The salaries of Chief Deputy County
Clerk Piper, fourteen .assistant register
clerks and thirty^one copyists were tied
up yesterday by injunction proceedings
commenced in the name of the city and
county by City Attorney Harry Creswell.
The procefedirigs were directed against
Auditor Brpderick, enjoining him from
auditing the demands for the salaries
earned by the deputies last month. The
case was assigned to Judge Hebbard for
trial and he fixed the 12th inst. for hear
ing it. A temporary injunction was issued
and served on the Auditor.
City and County Attorney Creswell was
authorized by the. Supervisors several
weeks ago to commence the action. The
contention is made that there is no law
pro%-iding for a chief deputy in the Coun
ty Clerk's office, arid that the fourteen
assistant register clerks and the thirty
one copyists are in excess of the number
allowed by law.

THIRD - STREET REPAIRS.
Ex-Assemblyman Treacy Now De
cides That Ha Does Not
Want the Contract.
The Supervisors on the Street Commit
tee have evidently determined to make
Dowlirig's cause their own, and to give !
him the contract for the Alamo square
work at the figures of the "private ar
rangement." The tactics employed by the
members of the committee at the session j
yesterday, by which L. A. Wlndrem'a ;
bid of $1399 was rejected and J. J. Dow
ling's bid of $1495 accepted, indicate that
the original "private arrangement" to give !
Dowling the work at his own figures and I
without, competition emanated from the
committee. The Superintendent of Streets,
Mr. Ambrose, distinctly declares that he
did riot know that the job had been given
to Dowling until he saw a gang of men
working at Alamo square. When the
Auditor held up the bills, the promoters
of the "private arrangement" put a reso
lution through the board to invite bids
in the regular manner. It should be kept
in mind, however, that the work had
been done long before the public com- i
petition vias invited. A little arrange
ment was privately made without con
sulting other contractors, and to enable
Dowling to get his money on this arrange
ment,, the Supervisors of the Street Com
mittee are resorting ta.all kinds of tricks
and dodges. .-â¢'.'.
The bids opened Jast Monday were re
ferred to the committee. At the regular]
session of the committee yesterday the
hlds were considered. Dowling was on
hand, accompanied by his attorney, Mr.
Gartland, who was formerly connected
with the Street Department, An affidavit
was produced from R. H. Copp, a bonds-,
man Of Wlndrem, to the effect that he
lâ¬opp)slgned the bond attached to Wind
rerri's .bid under a misapprehension, and
that he is not a resident and a freeholder
in ban Francisco, as the bond sets forth,
[ On this showing the committee rejected
! Windrem's low bui and recommended
award or the contract to Dowlin^ the
next lowest bidder. No hearing was
granted to the low bidder, and no steps
were taken to reject all the bids and read
yertise for new proposals, as that course
would not be in harmony with tho pri
vate arrangement.
. L--A- AVindrems story of his experience
in the affair Is decidedly interesting, as
it throws a sidelight on the scneme.
Speaking of the matter yesterday after
noon Mr, Windrem said: i went to the
ofliee of the clerk of the Board of Super
visors at 10:30 a. m. for the purpose of
going before the Street Committee to an
swer any questions that might be asked
concerning my bid to do the work on
Alamo Square. I am prepared to accept
the contract and perform the work. 1 was
shown to a reception room by the ser
geant at arms of the committee and told
to wait until I was called for. I went
into the reception room and waited a
long time. I saw many people going in
and coming out, and wondered why my
turn did not come. Finally I suggested
to the sergeant at arms that he should
ask the committee when they intended
to take up the Alamo Square work. He
said he would make the inquiry. He re
turned after he had been absent quite a
long time and said to me, 'That"s all set
tled by the committee.' I saw then that
I was tricked. Dowling was permitted to
go before the committee with his attor
ney, and I am informed that the case was
taken up at onCe to accommodate him. I
propose, to make a statement in writing
to the. Board of Supervisors. I know as
n lawyer that the bond I gave was proper
and sufficient, although Mr. Copp may
not be a resident of San Francisco. II
waited In the reception room to see the l
committee,, and my name was not called
and ho call was made for persons inter- j
ested in the Alamo Square work. I shall
present in writing to the board all these I
facts, showing that the committee tricked
me out of a hearing and rejected my bid I
on insufficient grounds."
The bids for repairing Third street, be
tween Mission and Howard, were con
sidered by the committee. Dowling's bid
on this -work was $950. The next lowest !
bid was that of Flinn & Treacy, for $2100.
The Street Committee rejected alltheblds.
[Then Dowling came forward and said
j that his bid was made under a misappre- i
henslon, so the committee rescinded
the resolution rejecting all the bids and
simply rejected Dowling's bid of $950. The
plan was all set by the committee at the
last meeting of the board to award the
contract to Flinn & Treacy at $2100, but
the striking discrepancy between the two
bids excited the suspicion of the Mayor

and the subject was referred to the
Street Committee again.
Contractor Treacy attended the session
yesterday and told the committee that he
did not care to take the contract at $2100,
as he would be obliged to keep the block
in repair for five years. Of course Dow
ling did not want the work at $950. The
committee seemed inclined to persuade
Treacy to take the work in the interest of
good government, but the ex-Assembly
man stood off to be coa. Mr. Treacy.
who is a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for Superintendent of Streets,
has been reading The Call's expert fig
ures on this Third-street job. The repairs
required on the block in question can be
made for $900. In view of disclosures re
cently made by The Call it is not prob
able that the city will be tied up by con
tract to pay a larger sum. The Superin
tendent has an army of employes on the
pay roll, and no doubt a sufficient force
could be spared from other work to repair
the bituminous rock pavement on Third
street.
At the next meeting of the Board of
Supervisors official steps will probably be
taken to ascertain under what authority
thf; City Street Improvement Company is
charging large sums of money for patch
ing up accepted streets. The Board of
Supervisors has not entered into a con
tract with that company. The Superin
tendent of Streets says that he had not
made a contract with the company to do
the work. Diligent inquiry fails to bring I
to light a scrap of writing in the form or j
semblance of an order authorizing the i
City Street Improvement Company to do j
the repairing. The combined efforts of i
the Mayor, Auditor and Grand Jury may |
bring to light all the details of another :
"private arrangement" for conducting
street Improvement contrary to law and I
public Interest
DESTBUCTION OF TROUT.
Woodchoppers Explode Dynamite in
the Deep Pools of Lagunitas
Creek.
The woodchoppers who are cutting
timber on the banks of Lagunitas Creek !
have been killing trout for some weeks j
past by means of giant powder cartridges,
and the Fish Commissioners have been
notified of the fact.
The following letter to ThÂ« Call from
Camp Taylor speaks for itself:/
Sporting Editor Call: Seeing that the Call
Is the only friend of the angler and thai it is
always ready and wilting to . speak the truth
regarding- Infractions of the fish anil game
laws, permit me to say that a disgraceful state
of affairs exists at present on Lagunitas (Jreefc.
The men who are chopping wood, tot the Char
ter or Howard estate on Lagunitas Creek are
dally destroying trout by placing explosives
In the deep pools. iA.rge numbers of dfaJ
trout can be seen in the pools, tmt the dast
ardly work goes on regularly without Interrup
tion. I understand that a deputy fish commis- !
sioner is here to look after ways that are dnrk ',
and wicked, but for some reason, probably ;
best known to himself, no arrests have been j
made so far. I think the railroad company
should Interest Itself in punishing those de
mons, who have already destroyed one of the
best fishing streams within several hundred
miles of San Francisco by the most outrageous
system of fish destruction. Yours truly.
HENRY WILFORD.
A Judgment Modified.
The Supreme Court has modified the
judgment in a ease in which A. H. Jsham !
was sued as. a guarantor tor another.)
Charles Fitzalleri made a note and cxc- j
cuted a mortgage to Helen Roberts on
land in San Diego County and Isham be
came the surety on the same. In the
note there was a provision that in case
it should be necessary to file complaint
oh foreclosure the sum of $50 would be i
allowed for. attorney, fees. FJtzallen - ;
failed to keep up in his payments, and;
upon action being brought judgment was
given for the face of- the note and
a deficiency judgment was entered ]

Mr. Henry. I have been troubled a long time with what I suppose
they call dyspepsia. I call it indigestion. I havo
had great pain in my chest for many years, and I
used to have difficulty in breathing at times, and
feel as if something had stuck in my throat, especially
after eating, and I always had to be careful what I
ite. I dared not eat pastry or hot rolls, and at times
[ would get dizzy in my head. I tried Pepsin and
other patent medicines, and I did not find much
benefit until the man at the drug store where I deal
asked me to try Ripans Tabules. . did, and I tell you
I felt more beneSt from one box of Ripans Tabules
than all the other ->tuff I had been taking. I had about
three or four boxes, and I am cured. I don't have
the pain in my chest, my bowels are more regular,
and I can eat any kind of food that is put before me.
jÃipans Tabules have made a good cure for me, and
- J tell youJL tell all my friends to try them.
j for the attorney fees of *00. From
I the latter an appeal was taken, and the
Supreme Court held that the guarantor
; had agreed to stand for the mortgage
i only and not for attorney fees, and
;he could not be taxed for them. To this
j extent the judgment was modified.

ARTICLE XIL
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby "eclared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that Its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon Tvhich this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as tho
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of waterworks by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may â â¢â deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase cf such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sale
to the City and County of existing util
ities in ordet that the electors shall
have the benefit of. acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the stgners thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and Coiinty, as
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Sunervisors must. Immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. The
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors &
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but in
case the votes cast In favor of bothpropositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast therein, :
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected.
Nothing in this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the ,
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore- i
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its j
determination to acquire the same at. j
provided in section six of this Article J
and from proceeding thereafter to ac- .
quire the same in the manner herein- '
after provided.
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired undo" the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the City
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it snail
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma- ,
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question |
â whether the same shall be acquired j
upon such terms. c Â« Â° V/
In case, however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there- j
of, as to render it necessary to incur a i
municipal bonded indebtedness for such I
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub- j
mitting propositions to the electors for ;
the acquisition thereof, shall specify '
therein the amount of the proposed â 
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter- j
est thereon, and whether such bonded ;
indebtedness shall be Incurred. At
least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal |
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth. j
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote j
shall have determined, as hereinbefore j
Bet forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of '
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the {
Supervisors shall proceed without de- i
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an- j
nual income and revenue of the City and '
County, the Supervisors shall, by or- |
dinance/specifically declare such de- j
termination, and shall publish the same ;
for at least two weeks in the official '
newspaper. : . :;.'-": .
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting of j
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
. mination as : above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting, thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
â weeks after the electors by vote shall i
have determined to acquire any public
'utility, the Supervisors by ordinance 'â 
: shall call a special election, at which
: shall be submitted; to the electors the
proposition of . acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in '
â ". such /ordinance. ONo question .â /â¢ other \
: than the acquisition of such utility and
;.' ; â¦he incurring ;;-pf"v the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at :â¢ such i
â 'â â ; election. ; ...;^'.- ;;;â /.:.;- 'â -*
â vo= â  Sec. 8. The ordinance -calling such.

.">.' and purposes far which ; the indebted
: ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
:. timated cost of the ,.:'- : proposed public
utility, the necessity for. the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City j
and County shall issue for the payment |
. .; -of the cost- of the same as in such; or- i
Â: dinance set forth (if the proposition be j
';,â¢ accepted by. the electors), and shall fix !

NOTICE TO MARINERS,
Forecast of Wind and Weather In the North
Pacific Ocean for April.
United States Branch Hydrographic Office,
San Francisco, March 3u, l!>ys.
The following forecast has Just been received
at this olrice frum the Hydrographic Office,
Washington, D. C:
The North Pacify-Pilot Chart for April will
Bhuw an almust permanent high, with 1Â»3 cen
ter about midway between the Hawaiian Is
lands and the coast of California, but a little
farther north than during March. The NE
trade wind belt will be found slightly widened
with the southern limit remaining about the
same, while the northern limit has moved
farther north than its position last month. The
general movement of the wind will be found
around this high, with the sun, and in that
portion of the ucean east of the Hawaiian Is
lands the wind may be expected to be gener
ally from the NE, while to the westward of
them the wind will frequently be easterly.
Near th& coast, within the â  northeast trade
wind limits, Instead of northeasterly winds,
northerly and nortawesterly winds may be ex
pected. It should be remembered that the
trade wind limits marked on the chart are
only the average ones for the month of April,
and vessels may find a slight diviatlon from
them, and may frequently pass from one trade
to another without any period of calms or dol
drums. The NE trades may be expected to
blow with an average foÂ»ce of 4 to 5 (.Beaufort
scale).
Just south of the Gulf of Alaska will ba
found the center of an almost permanent low
of considerable depth, and between this low
and the high will be found a general movement
of the atmosphere from the- west toward the
Aâeriean coast, and in tnia locality strong
westerly anil southwesterly wind? may be ex
pected. North of the fortieth parallel fre
quent gales, nftpn accompanied by hail and
snow squalls, may be expected. Frequent gales
may be expected in that part of the ocean In
the vicinity of the Juan de Fuca Straits, al
though the average point of entry on the
American coast storms '-nm the west Is situa
ted farther north than during last month. Fre
quent squalls may be expected In the vicinity
of the Hawaiian Island.
Occasional spiral circulations, viz.: the cy
clonic (against the sun); with low barometer,
and the anticyclonic. *with the sun), with high
barometer, will be found moving in a general
easterly direction across the ocean. Generally,
in front of the c-elqalc area, or the low, the
weather is damp, with thermometer rising
and barometer falling, while in fornt of the
anticyclonic circulation, or the high. It Is dry,
cooler and the barometer risos.
Occasional fog will be found along the coast
of the Vnited States' and in that part of the
ocean north of the fortieth parallel.
On the southeast coast of Asia the northeast
monsoon may be expected to decrease in forca
and constancy. W. S HTOHES,

A FACTORY
DESTROYED
BY FLAMES
American Biscuit Company
Is a Heavy Loser
by Fire.
The Cause Was Attributed to the
Heavy Shake on the Pre=
vious Evening.
Last evening the American Biscuit i
Company's factory, at Broadway and ;
Battery street, waa totally destroyed
by fire. About 6 o'clock an alarm was
turned In from box 354, and within a
few minutes two more alarms followed. .
When the Fire Department arrived â¢
smoke was pouring from all the win
dows throue-hout the buildiner. The de
partment did splendid work in confin
ing the flames to the one building, for
before the arrival of the first engine
the flames were leaping almost across
the street.
For over two hours the fire raged
fiercely, and it looked for some time as
If the adjoining block would be de- â¢
Btroyed, but fortunately the burning
structure was of brick, and it is for this
reason that the department was not
obliged to fight an all-night fire. The
only reliable solution of the origin of
I
FIRE SEEN FROM THE CLAUS SPRECKELS BUILDING.
the conflagration Is given by Night
Watchman Tim Phelan. He is of the
opinion that the severe earthquake the ;
previous night cracked the baking !
ovens in the upper portions and that !
the intense heat set fire to the wood- '
work above. This is the accepted the
ory, but it was also stated that many
baskets of pretzels which had been
placed on the ovens for drying pur
poses took lire and started the general
blaze.
A few minutes past 6 o'clock the
watchman discovered the blaze, and i
when he ran to the back of the store he j
discovered that considerable headway j
had been gained. He immediately ran |
to the auxiUai box near the oven and
turned' in an alarm. Before he could
make his escape he was overcome by
the smoke and sank to the floor In a
semi-conscious condition. Then the
hero of the evening made his appear
ance. Fred Terrill, who had heard the
crackling of the burning walls, ran to j
the point where the fire started, and, j
seeing the watchman on the floor,
rushed to the shipping clerk's office j
and, soon returning with a lantern, I
dragged the prostrate man to the fresh j
air, where he quickly recovered. The]
two men then rescued the books of the !
company, assisted by W. H. Callahan,
the assistant foreman, who arrived on
the scene shortly after the second
alarm.
The building Is divided by a fire wall
and for this reason the flames were
held in the rear portion for some time,
but in a while the whole structure was
on fire, as the windows and doors in
the dividing portion were open. This
created a draught and the flames soon
spread. The members of the com
pany were at a loss to see how a. lire
could have started from the furnaces,
but when the earthquake theory wa3
advanced the cause was readily under
stood.
For .many months the factory has
been employing a large number of men â 
and women to supply the Government ''â 
orders. The factory has been running
night and day, but as last night was
what has been termed "stock night,"
no one but the watchmen and tardy
workers were pivsent. The company is
a corporation. Leon Sloss of the Alska j
Commercial company is president, and |
James Dunn, vice-president nnJ man- j
ager. Among the twenty directors are |
Sam S. Sussmari, Thomas Jennings. '
Colonel Isaac Trumbo, A. Weexe and
J. K. C. Hobbs.
The total logs to the building, ma
chinery and stock is estimate:! at 8125;. j
000, fully covered by insurance. Mr. !
Dunn states that the building will be !
soon replaced with a more modern ]
structure. Over 200 people will bÂ«
thrown temporarily out of employment
because of the blaze. The Fire De
partment received praise on all sides
for having confined the blaze to he !
one building, as it was surrounded on â 
all sides by frame structures, and in
case they had become ignited it would
be hard to estimate the loss which may
have resulted.
Charles Gorman, an employe of the
company, gives the following as the
cause of the fire. He said: "I go on j
duty at 6 o'clock, and I had hardly
taken my coat off when I smelt some
thing burning. I went downstairs to
get a drink of water, and as I reached
the bottom I saw the baskets contain
ing the pretzels that were laid out to
be dried blazing. I rushed upstairs yelj
lng fire and found Tim Phelan and told
hlux to peuU in. aa alarm. Ha broke
open the auxiliary box and turned It
in and Phelan, Adam and myself ran
to the coil of hose, but found it would
not reach. "We did -what Aye could to
save the place, and then quit when the
liremen came." . â¢ â¢;
Tim Phelan. watchman, said: "I was
talkin-g: to the day watchman, whom . I
relieved, when I saw the flames. I
turned in an alarm and : then .got down
tho lire hose and was doing good work
till I bf-caine overcome by den&e sitwke.
I yelled for help and Fred Teftill canve
to my assistance and dragged me out...
I owe my life to him, as, had it not
been for his presence of mind in rush
ing for my bullseye lantern, I would
havf been burned alive. The place was
so dark that I could not llnd ray way
out, although traveling over the same
place ten and fifteen- times a night.
I have been employed by the company
for the last sixteen yoars. ami this is
the first fire we ever had. I attribute
BURNING OF THE AMERICAN BISCUIT COMPANY'S FACTORY.
It to the earthquake last night. I think
the shock cracked the ovens, and the
flames went through, catching the lay
ers of pretiels that were drying.

RISKED A LIMB
TO SAVE A LIFE
Officer Traeey Thrust His Arm
in Front of a Highbinder's
; Weapon.
By His BrsvÂ« Act He Intercepted a
Bullet Intended for a Brother
Officer's Body.
The police officers who assisted In the
arrest of the., two highbinders who as
saulted, and wounded LAirn Sier Wednes
day night are loud in their praises of the
bravery of Patrick Traeey, who received
a bullet wound in his ami; They say he
saved the ii'fe of one of them.
The shooting took place at the corner
of J3ulliv*n and Cum Cook alleys, directly
m front of the office of the squad of spe
cial police hired by the Chinese to guard
their Interests. Oeorge Downey, one
of the squad, was sitting inside the
door at the time, and as soon as he heard
the first shot he rushed to the scene of
action. Galloway, Traeey and Burke of
the regular Chinatown posse arrived at
about the same time, and alfmade a ruah
for the two highbinders, who were armed
with pistols. Traeey reached the men
first, running slightly to one side of
them. Bah Non flourished his revolver
j threateningly toward the three officers.
! who were approaching him from the
front. Traeey saw the Chinese raise the
revolver to shoot, and perceiving that
one of his brother officers was in great
| danger of receiving a bullet, he made a
lunge at the Mongolian with the inten
tion of knocking the gun from his hand.
Bah Npn discharged the weapon while
. Tracey's arm was between it and the
I other policeman, with the result that Tra
eey will carry the arm In a sling for some
days.
Me knew he would receive the bullet.
He also knew, that his associates were so
close to the highbinder that one of the
three would be sure lo receive a wound
which might prove fatal. Without hesi
tating a moment Traeey threw his arm
up and received the bullet which was in-
I tended for one of the party.
