to state to-night that Presi
dent McKinley will send his
message .. to Congress on
Wednesday; that up to this
time he has not determined
fully "what recommendation
he will make,, but that he
will make a recommendation
without leaving the initia
tive to Congress. He still
believes there is a possibil
ity of peace so long as war
has' not . actually begun.

war now hangs on the firing of the first
shot ' That is how near the United
States and Spain are to the brink of
hostilities.- '.'â¢...
â  v â¢ The meeting of the â  Cabinet to-day
was virtually -a council of war.
All of . the President's conferences
with omcials of the army and navy, with
Senators and. Representatives, with citi
" zens, some of .whom were patriotic and'
' some of whom were merely. sordid,
have looked for the beginning of hos
tilities in a very few days.
: All the Cabinet officials except Sec
retary Gage have accepted the inevi
table. The President abhors the
idea of war. â¢ He does not want to go
, to war until he can satisfy his own
conscience that it is just and that it
cannot be.avoided. lie is almost ab- i
normally sensitive on this point. Yet
â¢ he feels as everybody â that war
is here. '.. " â â  'â  ' '
A great calm has fallen on Washing
ton now that the worst is known.
. The "peace at any price" â¢ men have
disappeared. The tension is off and
every one is happy that the - die has
been cast,, since it had to be cast.
Every movement to-day has- been. in the
way, of preparation for the firing of the
first shot. '. ' ':â¢ .'.:â¢â¢"
The Spanish Minister may demand

connected with the Spanish legation
have already- sailed for home. Such
things as prudence and caution in. the
- way of -emergency preparations for
â¢ leaving this country, are being done.
It is presumed that the same. condition
prevails, at the American legation in
Madrid. Minister Woodford, of course,
has his orders as to what he shall do in
certain contingencies. â¢
In addition to this, orders of a very
stirring character were sent to the com
manders of all our fleets and squadrons
on the waters of the earth. These orders
were thatwar is impending and may be
expected any minute, and that they
. must be prepared to move instantly to
carry out the war -lans of the Navy De
partment. These orders have "one to
the commanders of the North Atlantic
squadron at Key West, the flying squad
ron at Hampton Roads, and the Asiatic
squadron; which is waiting at far-off
Hongkong to pounce down upon the
Philippine Islands. The plans for war
on land and sea are complete.
There is a great relief at the Navy
Department that the news from' Madrid
that the torpedo flotilla had arrived at
Porto Rico was false. The flotilla is
really at the Cape de Verde Islands,
three times the distance from Cuba that

are.

THE SENATE COMMITTEE
VIRTUALLY AGREED
UPON A DECLARA
TION OF WAR.
NEW YORK. April 2.â A "Washington special to the Herald
says: The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which rep
resents the sentiments of the Senate, to-day practically completed
Its report on the Cuban question and the destruction of the Maine.
This committee has decided to report a resolution along the
lines of the Foraker resolution, but to add the statement that
the destruction of the battle-ship Maine was caused by the neg
lect, if not by the complicity of Spalr, and that the Sppnfsh Gov
ernment Is responsible. There has been much discussion on this
point.
Several members of the commitee wpre of the opinion that the
Maine disaster was casus belli, and wished to base a declaration of
war on that. In the committee, however, the ruling sentiment
does not go so far, but is in favor of making the loss of the Maine
a very important and threatening feature of the report.
Senator ForaJcer's resolution, which will form the basis of the
report, excepting the Maine incident, reads:
"Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America:
"First â That the people of the Island of Cuba are, and of
right ought to be, free and independent.
"Second â That the Government of the United States hereby
recognizes the republic of Cuba as the true and lawful govern
ment of thaJ- island.
"Third â That the war Spain is waging against Cuba is so de
structive of the commercial and property interests of the Unit
ed States, and so cruel, barbarous and inhuman in its charac
ter, as to make it the duty of the United States to demand, and
the Government of the United States does hereby demand, that
she atone and withdraw her land and naval forces from Cuba
and Cuban waters.
"Fourth â That the President of the United States be, and he is
hereby authorized, empowered and directed to use. if necessary,
the entire land and naval forces of the United States to carry
these resolutions into effect."
This determination of the committee has been arrived at after
frequent consultations with the President.
Senator Davis, the chairman of the committee, left the session
of the committee and visited the White House, returning with the
President's matured views. Senator Davis has beon strongly of the
opinion that it was necessary for us to intervene in Cuba by force
of arms if we were going to have anything: to do with the Cuban
question beyond feeding the reconcentrados.
tions with Representative Hull and
other members of Congress, and it was
decided to put the army organization
bill through both houses on Monday
under suspension of the rules.
This bill makes the organization of
the army elastic and provides for its
increase to a war footing of 105,000.
All Ihe troops of the regular army
east of the Rocky Mountains to-night
are under arms waiting for orders to
move to the Atlantic seaooard.
General Miles desired that orders be
issued for them to surt to-night. Sec
retary Alger thought this would be too
alarming. This is the effect of conser
vatism in the Cabinet. There is a feel
ing in army circles that the Secretary
has made a mistake.
The corps of engineers of the army
was to-day allotted $1,000,000 more for
coast defense. It will be cheering news
to the Atlantic coast cities to know the
engineers report that work has pro
ceeded with une\oected rapidity every
where, and that sufficient material is at
hand for mining ali the harbors. Some
harbors have alren-'v been mined.
Money is now being poured like water,
and the effect of the contracts entered
into - when the $50,000,000 bill was
passed is becoming apparent.
We are ready for war. Plans have
been mapped out to provide ample
means for prosecuting a prolonged
and expensive campaign.
Many of these details were discussed
and put into form to-day by Secretary
of the Treasury Gage and Mr. Dingley,
chairman of the House Committee on
Ways and J&eans. By. a tax on tea,

coffee and beer $100,000,000 additional
revenue can be had. An issue of the
treasury certificates of indebtedness is
contemplated for providing another
$100,000,000. If more than that is
needed a bond issue may be suggested
which would provide just as many mil
lions as the emergency might call for.
There will be no trouble about get
ting all the money needed for aveng
ing the Maine and settling the Cu
ban question once for all.
The policy will be to get from our
revenues enough to pay as we go from
the start. The question now arises, how
will war come? The President will
send his message to Congress on Wed
nesday. It will contain all the Cuban
correspondence and will discuss fully
the Cuban question. It is said that all
forecasts as to what the President will
do are purely speculative. He does not
even know himself. I get this from
friends who have been in long and ear
nest consultation with him to-day.
There is little douDt, however, that
the President's message and the sub
sequent action of Congress will be
equivalent to a declaration of war.
That may be the only answer that
the United States will send to Spain.
The Maine question continues to the
front. The representations of the United
States regarding the blowing up of the
battle-ship by an outside explosion hav
ing been contemptuously ignored, all
Congress is aflame. An end of Spanish
rule in Cuba is demanded for the de
struction of the ship.
The Senate Committee on. Foreign

From Madrid.
Relations to-day decided to make the
Maine question the central feature
of the report which it will make.
The committee will report a resolu
tion in which Spain's culpability will be
exhibited much more -^niinently than
was done by the published testimony
or by the findings of the court of in
quiry.
In addition to this the committee will
bring forth the Foraker resolution,
which declares Cuba free, denounces the
infftimanities of Cuban war and recom
mends intervention by the United States
with its army and navy for the purpose
of expelling Sprain from Cuba. It is
not believed there will be a minority re
port from the committee.
Diplomatic negotiations between
the United States and Spain have
ceased.
They have not been formally severed.
President McKinley's message to Con
gress on Wednesday next will be,
so to speak, an ultimatum to Spain.
Then will come, doubtless, the formal
ending of our diplomatic relations with
the Spanish Government and the with
drawal of our Minister and Consuls

A GREAT GALE SCATTERS
SPAIN'S TORPEDO FLOTILLA.
?i NEW YORK. April 2.â A Madrid dispatch, which is confirmed by one ?
?Â» from Washington, says the Spanish torpedo flotilla was scattered?
Si by a heavy gale and had to put into St. Vincent, Cape Verde Islands,. J
82 for safety and repairs. "â¢' . I
his part, engaging tc have it accept
ed by the insurgents.
Secondâ That the relief to the Cu
bans should be administered directly
by Americans.
Both the hrst and the second of
these propositions have been unac
ceptable to the Spanish Government,
and to such a point that it would
rather go to war with the United
States than admit them.
This is not the time when words
can ease the mind. Nothing but ab
solute knowledge of the truth in its
broadest form can be of use now.
Let me tell you some of it derived
from the very best sources.
The fact, simply told, is that Spain
will not tolerate any interference
with her sovereign rights in Cuba,
but will give way on any point
which will bring peace without the
loss of her national territory or dig
nity.
The purchase of Cuba, as repeated
ly stated in these dispatches, is
equally out of the question. It does
not appear to be quite understood in
the United states that of late the
sentiment that America absolutely
intends to force a war upon Spain
has been fixed in the mind of nine
out of ten of the governing class. In
the Cabinet to-day, I have reason to
believe, Senor Moret is the only out
and out advocate of peace, and to
day he is only so on the principles
above stated.
Spain is deeply desirous of the
cessation of hostilities in Cuba at
once, but at a moment when she con
siders she has got the rebellion well
in hand she cannot ask for an armis
tice, but would accept an armistice
if the request came from the insur
gents, and she knows the United
States could 'bring that about if the
United States wished.
Spain thinksâ and I am giving
you the strictly Spanish side â it
would be an insult to the entire army
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
I COLWELL BUYS
% A NEW CRUISER.
LONDON, April 2.âLieuten
ant - Commander Colwell, the
United States naval attache here,
this afternoon purchased from
the Thames Iron Works for his
Government a cruiser of 1800 tons
displacement and capable of a.
speed of sixteen knots. The ves
sel carries six 4.7-inch gun.s and ,
ten smaller ones. She is i.tted
with twin screws and has a pro
tected deck. At 5 o'clock this af
ternoon Lieutenant-Commander
Colwell hoisted the stare and
stripes on the cruiser and had
then obtained a crew. The vessel
will go to sea within three days.
Lieutenant-Commander Colwell
says the price paid was very rea
sonable.
i and the dignity of the country to asK
for an armistice. Spain is quite will-,
ing that the government relief from
the United States shall be distribut
ed to the reconcentrados, but not in
dependently of Spanish authority. It
may be a fact disagreeable to digest,
but the Spanish Government looks
with the utmost suspicion upon the
! intentions of the United States on
this matter, and this is rather
strengthened by the recent discovery
that contraband articles are among
the consignments of relief stores sent
|to Cuoa. further, this would be
looked upon as American interven
tion by the insurgents, and that
Spain at all risks will combat. These
are the stumbling blocks which, at
present stop the way.
There are those who would go to
war with the United States out of
sheer hatred of her and her ways of
"bullying Spain." They are many.
There are those who would go to war
because they see in it the quickest2
ending of this everlasting and ruin
ous Cuban question. They are many.
There are also a few who harbor the
illusion that Spain could whip the
United States in a battle at sea,
which would be sure to occur. There
are many who would like it merely
to do damage to the United States,
to sink a cruiser or two, and to drive
trade from the United States to other
countries.
But the absolute sentiment of the
public is that there is absolutely
nothing to fear. Spain has nothing
to lose and everything to gain by
war with America. By reverse Spain
would lose Cuba, say they, but what
of thatP She has virtually done so
already. A half successful fight
with the United States would bring
the fighting renown of Spain once
more to the fore.
General Wooclfoid yesterday was
pessimistic, quite a new characteris
tic with him. and which points to the
extreme seriousness of the situation.
Senor Moret, on the contrary, seemed
to be entirely optimistic. All the
more so, as he had seen a telegram
from New York stating that Presi
dent McKinley could hold Congress.
The Minister of Marine is 'the
most active of all the Cabinet Min
isters, for it is fully realized that
whatever Spain can do in case of war
will be with her navy. Not a line
about naval matters is allowed to be
telegraphed out of the country, and
the censorship is of the keenest at
Cadiz. All hands are working over
time in the docks. The cruisers
Cristobal Colon and Infanta Maria
Teresa have arrived there, and the
torpedo boat destroyer Proserpina
from Ferrol. Every effort is being
made to have the finishing touches
put upon the Pelayo and Carlos V.
The Alfonso XIII has arrived at
Cartagena for her trials, and im
mediately afterward will join the
others at Cadiz. The gunboat Hal
con is in Cartagena, and will start
for Cadiz.
These will about form the squad
ron which will accompany the three
torpedo boat destroyers and three
torpedo boats as soon as they are
ready to sail. And with them will
go as an auxiliary the newly pur
chased yacht Giralda. The Princess
de Asturias is being hurried forward,
but will not be ready for some time.
The torpedo boat destroyer Audaz
has been made ready for sea.
She makes the third of the destroy
ers, the other two being the Destruc
tor and the Proserpina.

VERY BITTER
AT HAVANA
Spaniards Plainly Show
Their Hatred for All
Americans.
At Night the Prado Is Filled
With Recruits Drilling and
Making Ready for "War.
Those Who Think the Cuban Capital
Is Not Loyal to Spain Are
Very Much Mistaken.
Copyrighted, IS9B. by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, April 2.â The feeling is,
naturally, very bitter, though the Gov
ernment continues its praiseworthy as
surances that Americans in Havana
will be protected. The truth may as
well be told. Those who imagine that
Havana is anything but loyal to Spain
are mistaken. The city is stirred from
center to circumference with patriotic
ardor. No thought is given to the pos
sible outcome of a e< nflict with the
United States. The opinion prevails
that the honor of Spain has been as
sailed, and men of all classes are anx
ious to avenge it.
At nitrht the Prado is filled with re
cruits drilling and making 1 ready for a
possible emergency. The cafes are
nightly crowded with excited throngs,
who discuss the outlook and maintain
their temper with difficulty. An of
ficial last night said to me that the
sensational American papers had
wrought up the evil passions of the
people until he feared that the Ameri
can demand for war would prove irre
sistible. He spoke of those who are
responsible for these papers as guilty
of bringing about wholesale murder,
which he says war amounts to in mod
ern times.
A story that three American warships
were seen patrolling the Cuban coast
is not believed. The Vizcaya, which
went out with the Oquendo last night,
was spoken early this morning by the
Mascotte, lying off Havana. The Viz
caya is believed to have gone on to
rejoin the (Vjuenda,
Captain Cowles of the Fern last night
received a cipher dispatch from Wash
ington, which he was unable to read.
He believed that it contained important
orders. A duplicate has been asked for
to-day. The guard about the American
consulate will be increased to-morrow,
and no gathering in the Parque Cen
tral will be permitted. .
The commercial world here is as pan
icky as can be imagined. A dispatch
was recently received from J. P. Mor-
gan by a correspondent in this city,
saying that the situation grows worse
and worse. This dispatch was talked
about in banking circles, and created a
greater impression than any news that
has come from the United Ptates In a
week. The conservative position gen
erally assumed by Morgan is fully rec
ognized. â¢
Last year nearly $465,000,000 were paid
in wages and salaries by railroads in the
United States: the capital of the roads
was over $10,5e6,000,000, the mileage 182,776.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
COLUMBIA WITH
THE SQUADRON
flyers Under Command of Sctyey
Kept Under Stean), F^eady
for Instant ActioQ.
NEW YORK, April 2.â The Newport News (Va.) correspondent of
the Herald says: I learned to-day from a trustworthy source that the
vessels of the flying squadron will be kept in the James River opposite
this city, until hostilities are begun, or until there are material
changes in the situation. The cruiser Columbia came up from Old
Point Comfort this morning at 8 o'clock and anchored near the Massa
chusetts. On her arrival the Columbia fired a salute of eleven guns in
honor of Commodore Schley and the flagship, which she joined to-day
for the first time, although she has been in Hampton Roads since
Wednesday. When the reverberation of her eleventh gun died away,
Captain Cook gave the command, and the Brooklyn returned the salute
of the speediest ship now in the squadron, firing seven guns in rapid
succession.
The Columbia, between deck and water line, still retains her pure
white color, but the smokestack and other parts above deck have been
clothed in the dull lead hue recently ordered by the Navy Department.
Painters are working on the vessel to-day, and her appearance will soon
be transformed to correspond with the other vessels. The work of
scraping the bottom of the Massachusetts continues. Divers were at
work on the starboard side this afternoon, the marine growth on the
port side having been cleared away. The Brooklyn still occupies the
anchorage selected more than a week ago.
While there is but little probability that the flying squadron will
leave here within the next three days, unless the Brooklyn is sent to
sea for the purpose of testing her new rapid-fire rifles and turrets,
which have just been overhauled at the shipyard, steam is kept up
continually on all the ships, so that they could sail at a moment's
notice. Commodore Schley intends to mobilize all the ships assigned to
his squadron, some of which have not yet arrived, at Newport News, so
that he can easily communicate with their commanders. The Minne
apolis is expected to arrive in Hampton Roads to-ni-rht from League
Island navy-yard. She will probably anchor at Old Pqint Comfort if
she gets in late to-night and proceed to this port to-morrow morning. The
Texas will probably return to the squadron by Sunday afternoon. None
of the marines was allowed shore leave to-day.

Gaillard Stoney Raising a Regiment
to Be Officered by University
Graduates.
The recent events In connection with
the preparations for war have aroused
' a great deal of enthusiasm in the First
1 Regiment of Infantry of the National
i Guard, located in this city, and for the
; past two weeks much quiet work has
! been done toward placing the regiment
in a position to be sent to the front on
I very short notice. So far have these
' preparations gone that Colonel James
F. Smith, the commander, has tendered
the War Department the services of
'. the regiment, with a request that it
may be sent, if needed, to the point
where it can be of the greatest practi
cal benefit.
The regiment, composed of twelve
companies, is short only about 200 men
to bring it up to its maximum strength,
and the officers have assurance of more
than sufficient men to fill the ranks.
It has sufficient arms to supply all the
men, is provided with tents and all
necessary camp equipments. The only
things lacking at this time are over
coats and blankets, but arrangements
are being made to secure these on very
short notice. There is probably no
other regiment in the State that is so
fully prepared to go into the field as is
the First. The officers and men are
all anxious to go so as to be the first to
represent the State of California.
Gaillard Stoney, assistant City and
County Attorney, has started a move
ment to recruit a regiment which will
be officered by officers of the University
of California Cadets. He is a grad
uate of the university, and while at
that institution was an officer of the
cadets. As soon as there is assur
ance that there will be enough men to
make up the regiment it will be offered
to the War Department.
Adjutant-General Barrett was in con
sultation for quite a long time on Fri
day with Lieutenant-Commander
Thomas A. Nerney, acting cantain of
the Naval Militia, on the subject of
the orders received a few days since
from the Navy Department, which are
that a report shall be made without
delay as to the condition of the Naval
Militia of California. There will be
forwarded a detailed report of the num
ber of available men, and of the quali
fications of the officers.

SENATE COMMITTEE
WILL VIRTUALLY
DECLARE WAR
Continued from First Page.
from Spain and Cuba, together with a
formal declaration directing all Amer
icans in Spain and Cuba to place
themselves under the protection of the
representative of some other country,
probably Great Britain. Believing that
war is coming, the Stafe Department
has already taken steps for the protec
tion of American Consuls and other
Americans in Cuba.
Instructions were sent last night
directing all Consuls and Consular
I Agents to close their offices and pro
ceed at once to Havana.
Arrangements have also been made
for their safe conduct to the United
States as soon as it is definitely settled
that hostilities are to commence. Min
ister Woodford and all of our Consuls
in Spain have also been ordered to
hold themselves in readiness for a hur
ried recall.
As far as the President's policy
can be definitely stated, it is his
purpose that Spain should be first to
make the declaration of war. His
message to Congress and the action
of that body may furnish the provo
cation, but he still insists that the
first declaration of war should come
from Spain.
He has a lingering hope that Spain
may yet find some way of complying
with our demands, therefore, it is not
his intention to recall Minister Wood
ford until the last moment. No ad
vance will be made from this side in
the direction of reopening negotiations,
and from the way Minister Polo talked
at the Spanish legation to-day Spain has
given her final answer. Yet it is known
here that France and Great Britain as
Governments, and the financial repre
sentatives of those two countries con
trolling the Spanish debt, are bringing
pressure to bear upon Spain for the
purpose of having the Madrid Govern
ment take action at once toward con
ceding the independence of Cuba. The
authorities here are in a passive frame
of mind and would willingly take up
negotiations with Spain again if the
motion came from the other side. They
will not, however, voluntarily resume
diplomatic negotiations regarding the
general Cuban question.
They abandoned the idea of sub
mitting an ultimatum, which seemed
to be the purpose last night, because
they had a faint suspicion that if
this were not done Spain would again
approach us.
It was whispered in diplomatic circles
to-day that Spain was endeavoring to
enlist the good offices of some friendly
European power for the purpose of
arranging terms of peace between Spain
and the Cuban insurgents independently
of the United States. In a recent in
terview in the Herald Senor Moret in
timated that the independence of Cuba
might be brought about through the
medium of diplomacy, but that some
other power than the United States
would have to serve as mediator.
France, it is well known, is most
anxious to avert war between Snain
and the United States, and has unoffi
cially intimated that its good offices
would be promptly given if requested
by either of the parties concerned. It
is not likely, however, that France
would attempt to mediate between
Spain and the insurgents without the
consent of the United States, and this
will certainly not be given. Mediation
by any European power is entirely out
of the question.
The administration knows perfect
ly well that Congress would not con
sent to foreign mediation, and al
though anxious for peace, would not
entertain a proposition of this kind
in the face of the attitude of Congress
and of public sentiment.
The action of the German Govern
ment in pressing its Cuban claim against
Spain at the present time is thought by
State Department officials to be very
significant, if true. Up to this time the
department has not had any authentic
information showing that Germany con
templates making such a move. If she
does it evidently means, in the opinion
of authorities, that Germany is prepar
ing for a vigorous controversy with the
United States over the Monroe doctrine
in its application to the Cuban problem.
ACCUSES BRANN'S MANAGER.
Dying Captain Davis Says He Had
Two Antagonists.
WACO, Texas, April 2.â Captain T. E.
Davis, Brann's antagonist in the terrible
street duel yesterday, lingered until 3
o'clock this afternoon. In Davis' declara
tion before a notary he made a statement
that \\ard. Brann'a business manager,
who whh with Brann at the time, shot
him as he lay on the sidewalk. Upon this
statement Ward was to-day arrested and
jailea charged with murder.

HAVANA. April 2.â The situation
here is more serious. General Lee has
received no communication either by
mail or cable from the State Depart
ment at "Washington since March 28,
though he has sent several dispatches.
Consul Barker at Sagua and Consul
Brice at Matanzas have likewise not
heard from the State Department or
General Lee, and they would be in
formed if grave steps following Spain's
reply had been decided upon at Wash
ington. In the absence of information
such as he would probably have by this
time, if the Government had decided
that he would have to leave Havana,
General Lee is led to think that diplo
matic relations may continue between
the two countries longer than the ex
tremists say is now possible.
Many Americans were at the consul
ate and at Dr. Brunner's office to-day
preparing for departure or seeking ad
vice. All who asked advice were told
they must be guided by the weight of
their interests here as compared with
the gravity of the situation. I notice
that many who scoffed at the possibil
ity of trouble two weeks ago, who were
not affected during the previous peri
ods of excitement, are pessimistic this
evening. I have been told by a confi
dential agent here of a big New York
firm that for the first time in the his
tory of the Cuban trouble had
wired a warning that Americans in its
employ here should be ready to leave.
General Lee has not abandoned hope
that immediate trouble will be averted
in spite of the feeling here among all
classes that its shadow is now upon th^
two great nations. Military men here
Â«h<>w patriotic enthusiasm, but up to
this hour, in spite of the fact that ev
ery one is talking of the situation there
has been no sign of disorder and for
eign residents go about as usual. The
next Ward line ship will carry off some
of the remaining Americans and others
will go to Key West and Tampa. Some
families having young children will go
to Mexico.
NAVAL LIEUTENANTS
ORDERED TO THE EAST.
Lieutenant Geo. M. Stoney, in charge
of the naval rendezvous at 10 Califor
nia street, and Lieutenant W. S.
Hughes, in charge of the United States
branch hydrographic office at the Mer
chants' Exchange, have both received
'telegraphic orders from Washington
through Admiral Kirkland at Mare Is
land, in command of the Pacific station,
to proceed East immediately and re
port to the commandant of the Brook
lyn navy yard.
The naval rendezvous has been
crowded for some days past while the
enlisting of seamen and engine-room
men has proceeded under recent orders.
This work Lieutenant Stoney turned
over to his assistant, no one having yet
been designated to take his place and
proceed to get ready for his immediate
departure for the East.
In the absence of other instructions
Lieutenant Hughes leaves the work of
the Hydrographic office in charge of
Mr. J. T. McMillan, the nautical ex
pert, and leaves for New York to-mor
row in company with Lieutenant Sto
ney. The lieutenant did not know what
further orders they would receive on
arrival at Brooklyn navy- yard, but pre
sumed that they would each be as
signed to duty on one of the new swift
yachts just purchased by the Govern
ment, as dispatch and observation
boats.
URGES RETALIATION
FOR AMERICAN TARIFF.
BUDA PESTH, April 2.â ln the de
bate on the estimates in the House of
Magnates Count Szechenyi re
ferred to the prohibitive tariff of the
United States and urged that the Aus
tro-Hungarian Government take ac
tion, even to the point of retaliation.
The Minister of Commerce admitted
that the sugar exports have suffered
greatly. He said that it would be ex
pedient to adapt a definite attitude to
ward the United States in regard to the
tariff. The initiative, the Minister of
Commerce said, could not be taken by
Hungary, but he hoped that the Euro
pean States that wer^ injured by the
United States tariff would agree to take
united action and carry out a vigorous
policy.

ThÂ© Call's Special Correspondent in
' Dublin Describes the Situation
-' ' In the Island.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
DUBLIN, March- 19.â 1t Is scarcely
too much to say that the eyes of most
Irishmen are just now turned on the
debate which is to 'begin on Monday
next In the House of Commons on the
local government bill. This measure,
as I have before mentioned, has ex
cited among the Orangemen of the
north of Ireland almost as much oppo
sition as did the home bills of Mr. Glad
stone. That party regard it as a con
cession to what they call sedition and
separation, and for supporting it they
have already (ailed to account the one
or two representatives of Orange con
st ftuencles who belong to the Govern
i ent which has proposed it. The At
t irney-GeneraJ for Ireland, for in
stance, Mr. Atkinson, who sits f^r
North Derry County, has been practl
called upon to resign his seat.
The question which is exciting at
tention is whether the Government will
listen to those rabid outcries against
â  nuine reform, and Mr. Balfour'ft
i on Monday is expected to gi >"c
the answer. As far as I can judge
the Government v.ill not recede from
the position they have assumed. This
le all the more likely In view of the
fact that the "loyalist" minority in the.
three southern provinces, although ob
jecting to many proposals of the bill,
do hot object to its main principles.
This week the Earl of Mayo, a typical
Irish landlord, who has his estates In
Kildare, has written an article in which
!i-' advises his fellow Unionists to ac
cept the "inevitable" and make the best
of it, and this is the attitude of most
o!' Lis class outside Ulster. It will oe
rather difficult for the Government,
With such declarations before them, to
yield to the Intolerant views of their
extreme supporters in Ireland. But a
nay or two will tell.
Meanwhile, th" Unionist Ministers are
a i a fearful discount among the main
body <>f their Irish friends. They came
into office on an anti-Irish cry, and, so
far as Ireland is concerned, they have
â  i :.â¢â¢ ;: single thing which was
â  Kpected "ii either side. It is an in
teresting but very instructive specta
cle, for. in "point of tact, what it teaches
is that Knglish Governments have no
natural regard for any party in Ire
land, and d<> for any party only what
expediency dictates.
I regret to say that the latest ac
counts from the distressed districts in
the west and south of Ireland represent
the state of things there as exceedingly
grave. It would be an exaggeration to
Bay that the failure of last year's crops
produced general distress in Ireland or
indeed any real distress throughout the
greater part of Ireland, but It would
be equally wrong to minimize the se
verity of the distress which it has oc
casioned' In the cmgested districts of
the south and west â that zone of per
ennial misery which borders the sea
and, at Intervals, extends a good dis
tance inland, from the coast of Done
gal to the coast of Kerry. Within that
7'.>ne the condition 'of the smaller occu
piers of land is simply heartrending.
ThÂ«Â» ordinary food supply having failed,
the people are obliged to live on Indian
meal, and they cannot procure a suf
ficient quantity even of that means of
Bubslstence without the aid of charity.
The Government, after much pres
sure, started some "relief" works for
their benefit, but the wages paid for
labor done are scarcely enough to keep
body and soul together. A few shillings
a week, when everything has to be
bought, go but a very little way, as It
may well be Imagiiw-d, toward main
taining a family often nimberin? from
eight to twelve members, and when It
Js added that this wage har sometimes
to be earned by the women of the fam
ily owing to the enfee.bled bodily con
dition of: the male bread-winners. It can
lie easily .understood that the most har
rowing'--incidents are often witnessed.
The "worst -of the matter is that the
remedy for this terrible state of things
Is perfectly obvious and easily attain
able, and yet is not adopted. What
causes this distress is that In 'the dis
tressed districts'/the people are huddled
together upon -little patches of land
from which they can hardly derive suf
ficient subsistence even in prosperous
seasons, while in their immediate
neighborhood- are immense tracts of
land wholly devoted to the rearing and
fading of sheep and cattle. What is
'â antedâ and the only thing that is
'vanted'-is to divide up this grazing
]ttnd among' (he small occupiers. It
Is not proposr-d that the land should be
taken without roinTi'-nsation. It is pro
i that, the proprietors should be
paid foT It. and it is simply disgraceful
that a Government which can spend

The '98 centenary celebration In the
Phoenix Park last Sunday was one of a
very impressive and imposing kind. It
was attended by an enormous gather-
Ing, chiefly recruited of course from
Dublin itself, but composed also of rep
i rosentativ.'s from all the four provinces
of Ireland. The meeting was so large
that four platforms had to be impro
vised, one for each of the provinces,
! and at each speeches were delivered by
i well-known Nationalists who do not, all
jof them, agree on other subjects. As a
preliminary demonstration, it was de
cidedly successful, and at the same
time, while it showed unmistakably
that the spirit of Irish nationality is
alive and vigorous, there was noth
ing about It to give any ground or even
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
! colorable pretext for the absurd
: fears which some Irishmen belonging to
â  the "loyal" minority seem to entertain
j in regard to any commemoration of the
"Men of '98." By right, indeed, the
members of that minority ought to be
themselves among the foremost in
celebrating the memory of '98, and that
for very obvious reasons.
In the first place, tho original pro
gramme of the "United Irishmen" of
that period was one of constitutional
reform. It embraced nothing more
than the widening of the suffrage on
which the Irish Parliament was elected,
the emancipation of the Catholics, and
the making of the executive Govern
ment responsible to the legislative au
thority. No doubt, the United Irishmen
aimed ultimately at other things widely
different, but the main body of them
at heart were forced to do so by the
tactics of the English Government of
the time which, tho-ugh an Irish Parlia
ment existed, appointed the executive
for Ireland and directed all its opera
tions.
Those tactics Include! the most atro
cious outrages on the people. A for
eign soldiery were let loose, and with
them and the native minority burned
tho chapels a.nd churches of th" ma
jority, looted the peasants' homes on
the slightest pretexts, violated their
women and destroyed their property.
The natural result was the insurrection
of '98. and the pity of it was that it
was left chiefly to one county â Wex
ford â to rise In armrrl "rebellion."
But the origin of the whole matter
ought not to be forgotten, and it Is
true, as I have said, that the original
programme of the men of '9S was con
st it utional reform, and that tbose who
had the chief part in framing that pro
gramme were the Protestants and
Presbyterians of Ulster, who now so
strongly object to any celebration of
the men or of the deeds of '9Â»
What is called the "castle season" in
Dublin is just drawing to a close. This
"castle season" means the series of
dinners, balls, levees and other enter
tainments given by tho Lord Lieuten
ant at the viceregal lodge or Dublin
Castle during the winter months. Up
to the time when Mr. Gladstone took
up home rule these entertainments
were participated in by all the leading
gentry and by the peers of Ireland, i
Before that time, whatever might be
the political color of the Ministry ofthe
day in England the executive in Ire
land was always looked on as the
friend of the minority, and, according
ly, to every levee, ball and dinner given
by a Viceroy, whether he happened to
be a Liberal or a Tory, there trooped
the whole genteel regiment of Irish
"loyalist" ladies and gentlemen. The
Home Rule era came at last in 1886,
with the Earl of Aberdeen, now the
Governor- General of Canada, and the
hlgh-and-dry aristocratic. "Unionists,
as they began to call themselves, at
once rigidly boycotted the viceregal
court. They would not recognize the
representative of the Queen because he
was also a member of a Home Rule
administration.
The Home Rule Government of 1886
was soon beaten, and then there came
to Ireland the Unionist Marquis of Lon
donderry, the descendant of the Lord
Castlereagh who promoted the insur
rection in '98 and carried the union of
1800 The Irish aristocracy and gentry
again began to flock to Dublin Castle,
and the ' viceregal lodge in Phoenix
Park, and old times were once more
restored.
In 1892, however, there was another
change. A Home Rule Government
came In again and a Home Rule
Lord Lieutenant came to Dublin. The
social boycott was immediately re
newed. Lord Houghton, now the Earl
of Creve, was treated in precisely the
same manner as Lord Aberdeen by the
"loyalist" peers and gentry of Ireland.
He could get no one to attend his en
tertainments bo-ond the leading mem
bers of the Castle entourage and the
civil service.
In 1895 another change of Govern
ment occurred, and the scene was en
tirely changed once more. Lord
Cardigan, as a Unionist Viceroy gath
ered around him again the old aristo
cratic habitues of the castle, and so it
has come to pass that the "castle sea
sons" since, including the present one,
have been what is called brilliant.
There has been no end of. dinners, balls
and levees, all largely attended, ;ind
within the past week an additional
source of attraction to the castle sea
son has been afforded by the installa
tion of the Earl of Arran as a "Knight
of St. Patrick." All those entertain
ments have been always much of a
piece. They have been, as well as I
can gather, extremely dull affairs, and
consist in a number of finely dressed
ladies and men In hired uniforms bow
ing to his Excellency and waiting for
hours in a crowded hall for the mere
purpose of having their names in the
newspapers the following day and mak
ing a political demonstration.
It Is a sorry business at the best, but
it is the means of circulating some
money among the traders of Dublin,
and so long as that is the case, I sup
pose such things are not without their
uses.
One of the most (personally) popular
of Irish pressmen has died in the course
of the past week in the person of Dr.
Patton, editor of the Dublin Dally Ex
press. He was not only editor of the
Express, but also for many years Dub
lin correspondent of the London Times.
In this latter capacity he filled :â >. very
important post and served his partyâ
the party of the "loyalist" minority
very well, indeed. In other word*, he
did a good deal of harm in his time
to the Irish cause, for the Irish news
in the Times was tho chief source of
information for Englishmen on Irish
affairs. But, personally, as I have said,
he was very popular, for he was a c.mr
teous. affable and educated gentleman
who never abused his position to in
dulge in personal attacks. Amotiff his
fellow journalists especially he was a
"persona grata." With his demise, In
all probability, will come a change not
only in the editorship, but in the poli
tics of the Express. That journal lias
up to the present been a high and dry
Tory organ, and the organ especially
of the Protestant clergy of Ireland. It
is extremely significant of the change
of opinion in Ireland that the general
belief is that the paper is henceforth
to be owned by Mr. Horace Plunkett.
who is by no means a Tory of the old
school. The fact is, that the old Tor.
ies are now wiped out in Ireland, as
well as in England, and in a few years
more they will be completely a thing
of the past.

eagerness of the colonel to have his

he might go to the polls and vote in
favor of the bonding of San Rafael for
$15,000 to bu.Ud a new high school.

When it came to stating his present
business the colonel scratched his head
and thought for a moment. It was a
perplexing position, for In the eyes of the

by Superior Judge AnÃfllotti. Finally
Flnigan declared that he was a farmer.

PLANS OF
ATTACK ARE
ALL FORMED
When War Is Declared Our
Warships Will Take
the Offensive.
Three Squadrons That Will Lose
No Time Razing the Cities
of Spain's Colonial
Possessions.
NEW YORK, April 2.â A
Washington special to the Her
ald says: Believing that war is
certain to follow the transmis
sion of the President's message
to Congress on the Cuban ques
tion, Secretary Long, by direc
tion of the President, issued or
ders to-day for an offensive
movement of the naval forces of
the United States Immediately
upon a declaration of hostilities.
These Instructions advised the com
manders-in-chief of the three squad
rons, which will be called upon to carry
out the plan of campaign prepared by
the naval strategic board, of the
seriousness of the situation, that the
crisis has come, and that they must be
ready to make a forward movement
upon the receipt of telegraphic instruc
tions from the department. At a word,
therefore, the fleet under the command
of Captain W. T. Sampson will proceed
to Havana, the flying squadron under
the command of Commodore W. S.
Schley will steam at its greatest speed
for Porto Rico, and the Asiatic squad
ron under the command of Commodore
George Dewey will start from Hong
kong, where it is now gathered, for the
Philippine Islands. Three days after
a declaration of war the cities of
Havana, San Juan and Manila will be
under the guns of formidable squadron?
and every effort will be made to reduce
them as quickly as possible.
The orders to the several squadrons
given by Secretary Long are the result
of a conference he held at the White
House this morning with the President,
Assistant Secretary Day, Secretary
Gage and Secretary Alger. The confer
ence was not intended as a Cabinet
meeting, but in view of the practical
unanimity of the administration circles
that war is imminent, it was deter
mined by Secretary Long to discuss
with the President and the remainder
of his advisers at the White House the
advisability of having everything in
readiness for the squadrons to move
in the shortest possible time.
In accordance with instructions sent
by the department some days ago Cap
tain Sampson has removed all the sur
plus' woodwork from the vessels of his
Beet and has painted the vessels a dull
. lead color, and similar action has been
taken by Commodore Dewey and Com
modore Schley with reference to the
'.ship's attached to their commands.
Everything is therefore in readiness Cor
war: It is expected that the BeveraJ
squadron commanders will at once di
rect that commanding officers of vessels
â¢under their command shall take on
board all supplies that may be neces
". pary. In tli-' case <>t Commodore Dew
' ey, operating so far from a naval base,
It js absolutely necessary that his ships
shall be well filled with coal and other
stores before war commences. It is
believed by the department that he has
carried out the instructions which have
been- sent him on this point. Further
more, there is reason to believe that
. â¢ Commodore Dewey has made arrange
ments with coal dealers in British and
Chinese ports whereby lus vessels will
. be able to refill coal bunkers whenever
they shall b.>eome empty. It is appre
ciated by the authorities that in the
event of war neutrality will require the
several nations of the East to permit
the" sale of only sufficient coal to en
able the belligerent vessels lo reach
their nearest home port. In the case
of American ships this would be San
Francisco, but there is no intention of

bringing the ships home until they have
destroyed the Spanish naval force in
the Philippines and wrecked the forti
fications. Then some of the vessels
may be ordered to the North Atlantic
Coast to re-enforce the vessels operating
in thc-isf waters, or to the Pacific Coast
in case it should be ascertained that
â¢he flying squadron has been sent by
Spain to the slope to attack the cities
there.
Officials familiar with the plan of
campaign prepared by the department
believe that it will be executed with
precision and judgment, because tho
men who will carry it out are officers
of experience specially selected to per
form the trying duty, and the ships
under their command are superior to
those of Spain. Reports which have
been received from Commodore Dewey
are to the effect that the Spanish au
thorities in the Philippines are mining
the entrance to Manilla, and other har
bors. The same precautions are being
observed in Spain as in the colonial
possessions of that power.
Commodore Dewey has under his
command the protected cruisers Olym
pia, Baltimore, Raleigh, Boston and the
gunboats Concord and Petrel, which
will be able to overpower the wooden
cruisers and the four gunboats which
Spain has in the Philippine waters.
The departure of the Vlzcaya and
Oquendo from Havana Is a matter of
sincere regret to the officials in the
harbor of Havana. Captain Sampson
would have been able to so station his
ships as to have prevented their de
parture, and at the same time to make
it apparent it would be foolhardiness
for them to attack two battle-ships,
three double-turreted monitors, one
coast defense ship, besides several pro
tected cruisers, gunboats and torpedo
boats which are under his command.
V.'ith the probabilities that the
Oquendo and Vizcaya have gone to
Porto Rico, it is evident according to
the officials that Commodore Schley's
squadron may be the first to engage tha
Spanish. It will be the duty of the Hy
ing squadron to take Porto Rico. Tv
view of the absence of the Spanish tor
pedo boat flotilla, it is not expected this
will be a difficult task. With Spain's
colonies in the West Indies in the pos
session of the forces of the United
States, her possible basis of supply for
opeiation against the I'nitjd States
will be gone; she will have to conduct
meneuvers with the Canaries or Spain
as her base of supplies.
Appreciating that war is terrible, the
authorities do not anticipate the vic
tories which will be gained by the fleets
of the United States will not be paid
for in both men and ships. The reduc
tion of Havana is expected to take
time, for the defenses are in fairly good
condition. The harbor will be mined
and other preparations will be made
which will insure a warm reception be
ing given the vessels flying the Ameri
can flag. In view of the prospects of
stubborn resistance from sea, the au
thorities have made arrangements, as
the Herald has stated, for the capture
of Matanzas. The army will be landed
at this point, from which it will move
upon Havana from the rear. By the
combined operation of the land and sea
forces it is expected that the city will
fall.

READY FOR FLIGHT.
The Queen Regent and Ker Boy King
Will Leave the County if an
Uprising Occurs.
BERLIN, April 2.â The German Em
bassador at Madrid, Herr yon Rado
witz, reports to the Foreign Office here
that the Spanish royal family fears an
outbreak unless the difference between
the United Statos and Spain as soon
settled. The Carlist movement is as
suming a more active form and the
royal family fears especially a pro
nunciamento from General Weyler and
the military party.
Everything is prepared in the royal
castles for Might. The boy King Al
fonso will be taken to San Lucar de

a yacht is kept ready for sailing.

George Ficks, a Grand Army vete
ran, has opened a recruiting office at
Seventh and T streets. An American
Hag floats in front of the place, and a
large red lettered sign announces that
"enlistments for the war with Spain
will be received here."
It is not an exaggeration to say that
the feeling here is intense. On all sides
can be heard the admonitory expres

LONDON, April" 2.â The nervousness
of the stock markets, which was em
phasized by a sudden drop of 3 per cent
in Spanish fours at the opening of the
Stock Exchange, has been fully re
flected in diplomatic circles, which have
experienced almost as much difficulty
as outsiders in extracting facts from
the mass of contradictory statements
regarding the Hispano-American crisis
to-day. Beyond opining generally that
matters -were nearing a crisis there was
not a man In London of read weight
who was willing to risk an opinion as
to whether the outcome would be peace
or war. Even now, there is a difference
of opinion; but. the distinctly warlike
tone of the great mass c/f evidence and
the marked divergence of the United
States demands and Spain's proposals
have led the majority to conclude that
the parting of the ways has been
reached unless, within a few hours,
Senor Sagasta is able to give assurance
that the delay he asks for will Insure
the complete freedom of Cuba. It is
not too much to say all Europe regrets
the threatening prospects of war,
though for different reasonsâ some bÂ«
cause genuinely friendly nations are in
volved and others because they dream
that the war bacillus will spread and
aggravate the fever' sh spirit of unrest
already in evidence in the Old World.
To the last, therefore, it is hoped that a
solution will be found, even wh< n Spain
is apparently intractable. The best in
formed persons beliave Spain is only
temporizing, as it is recognized there
ia difficulty in the Spanish Government
accepting without demur the d?tuandÃ
of the United States in viaw of the
darker of a revolut' >n and the over
throw of the monarchy. S~>, though
realizing the imminence of hostilities,
tht apparent hopelessness of averting
war hap come as a thock.
It .was generally believed that the
enormous majority obtained by Senor
Sagasta in the new Cortes would make
him master of Spain and permit him
to yield to the inevitable^ but it seems
that the 75 per cent of the voters who
did not participate in the elections, in
cluding the army, and the Bareclona
and other merchants who are vitally
interested in Cuba, do not propose to
allow him a free hand. They have
been among the most fervent in the
patriotic demonstrations of the past
few days.
General interest in the situation is
intense. All the news bulletins are
eagerly scanned and in the lobbies of
the House of Commons yesterday even
ing there was animated discussion of
the crisis. Interest has been enhanced
by the statement of a prominent ship
owning member of the House of Com
mons that the United States, during
the day, had been offering very large
sums for nineteen-knot steamers.
Although the consensus of opinion is
that there Is no escape from hostilities
unless the unforeseen, as so frequently
happens in politics, changes the course
of events, there are few hopeful peo
ple left.
James Brice, M. P., the former pres
ident of the Board of Trade and author
of "The American Commonwealth," Is
quoted as saying: "Somehow, I fancy
that, as near as the two powers may
have drifted toward war, we are not
going to witness so frightful a calamÂ«
ity. I know President McKinley and
all his administration and I know
they do not wish for war. In fact,
none of the really clear-headed men in
the United States want war. They can
see too far ahead."
Opinion in London has been little in
fluenced by the specious character' of
Senor Sagasta's counter-proposals. An
official of the Foreign Office remarked:
"The Americans will naturally decline
to accept such nroposals as a sufficient
guarantee that a power which has so
long patently failed to discharge its
duties in a humane administration
cannot be trusted to give effect to its
tardy conversion." The foreign official
added: "The responsibility resting
upon each party is terrible. Happily,
nothing will tend so effectively to
quicken the feeling of responsibility
among Spanish statesmen as the pros
pect of having to face immediately the
grim consequences of persistence in an
uncompromising force.
"Reading between the lines of Senor
Sagasta's proposals I have reason to
think he does not mean to drive mat
ters to extremes, and that he will learn
from the construction put upon them
that his condition will not relieve the
United States of the duty of interven
tion, compelled, as the Americans are,
by a sense of moral obligation, to take
action in the matter. So, if Senor Sa
gasta is as strong as he is unquestion
ably well meaning, he will persuade his
countrymen to accept unreservedly the
American conditions."
The positive semi-official declaration
telegraphed last night from Madrid, in
which it was announced that no propo
sition containing the slightest allusion
to the independence of Cuba, either
with or without indemnity, has been
made to the Spanish Government, that
the Government would straightway re
ject any such propositions, and that
there is no party or statesman in Spain
disposed to listen to such a solution of
the crisis, has created a mild sensa
tion here, as It has been assumed that
the independence of Cuba was the crux
of the difficulty. It has even been sug
gested in pro-Spanish circles that the
war party in the United States
launched this device in order to upset
diplomatic negotiations at Madrid.
Spanish circles here have been great
ly excited by the publication of an in
terview with the Spanish Consul-Gen
eral here, Senor Jurado, who dbnveyed
the impression that if the settlement of
the difficulty was left to the Spaniards
of London, Spain would fight; but other
people here point out that the Span
iards do not realize the volcano which
is beneath them. They suspect the
United States of "bluffing" and believe
she is afraid to come to close quar
ters. In addition, the Spaniards have
a profound faith in the infallibility of
their fleet.
Senor Jurado tersely expressed the
feelinp: of his compatriots, saying: "If
my country wants me, my money,
clothes, everything, it shall have all,
even my last shirt button."
From the extraordinary activity at
the Spanish legation here it Is evident
that Spain is seeking the friendly of
fices of the foreign office. Indeed, it
is generally thought that the frequent
visits of the French, Austrian, Rus
sian and Spanish Embassadors to the
British foreign office, is connected with
the Cuban situation.
The newspapers, reaching the stage
of regarding war between the United
States and Spain as inevitable, are
printing maps of the area of probable
operations, details regarding the fleets,
the facts concerning the troops, arma
ments, preparedness of the medical
corps, etc. The naval experts dwell
upon Spain's disadvantages in having
to act at such a distance from her
naval base. One high authority re
called an interesting impression derived
abroad from a Spanish man-of-warâ
that the element which will tend se
riously to the detriment of the Spanish
navy will be found in the contempt
with which the superiors regard their
inferiors. He said: "They all look
upon the rank and file as completely
beneath them, and entertain a sort of
feudal scorn for their subordinates."
The Statist anticipates hostilities,
which it regards as imminent, though it
does not relinquish the hope that it will
cause a big advance in the money mar
ket In London.. The paper thinks the
United States will require a large loan,
which will find a ready market here,
especially as, under the circumstances,
the Government will have no difficulty
in inducing Congress to make the In
terest and the principal payable in
gold.

RAISING
REVENUES
FOR WAR
How Conflict With Spain
Would Cause Taxes to
Be Increased.
By Adopting Methods Employed
in '66 Uncle Sam Could In
crease His Income to Al
most a Billion a Year. /
NEW YORK, April 2. -A
Washington special to the
Herald says: "In modern days
â  a well-supplied war chest and an
â¢ impregnable credit are as im
â  portant as are warship**, shore
â  batteries or regiments of men."
These words of wisdom, which bear
bo strongly on the existing situation,
were contained in Secretary Gage's re
port submitted to Congress at the be
ginning of the present session. The
Secretary and Chairman Dingley of the
House Committee on Ways and Means
are now preparing to take steps to fill
the war chest and put the treasury in
condition to meet all the demands that
a conflict with Spain may impose on it.
After the Cabinet meeting to-day
Secretary Gage and Assistant Secretary
Vanderlip went over the statements
submitted by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue, giving estimates of all the
various sources of revenue that might
be availed of in the event of war. Much
j of the additional revenue that is raised
will have to come from internal taxa
tion, as the Dingley bill has put tariff
taxes on most articles up to the limit.
The Secretary's estimates, however,
show that a considerable increase can
I be made in customs receipts by impos
ing taxes on articles now admitted free
of duty. Any recommendations that
would be made to Congress for addi
tional revenue will include a recom
mendation for a tax of 4 cents a pound
on coffee, which, on the basis of im
portations, it is estimated, will yield
about $29,000,000 a year additional rev
enue, and the recommendation of a tax
of 10 cents a pound on tea, which will
yield a little moi'f than $11,000,000, it is
believed, .and another million may be
raised from a tax on spices. This will
make a total of $41,000,000 for these
three articles.
Congress will be asked to Increase the
tax on beer from $1 a barrel to $2, and
j the resulting increase in revenue, it is
i estimated, will be about $36,000,000 a
! year, and this will be the largest in
j creased revenue from any one source.
' whipky is now taxed fully up to the
1 highest revenue-producing point, and
no additional revenue can be raised
from this source. Tobacco and cigars
will stand a substantial increase, how
ever, and may be made to yield eight
or ten millions additional. Other odds
and ends of taxation can be founi
which will make a total increase in tha
revenues of the Government amounting
to fully $100,000,000 r year, and still
leave other sources of revenue whii rv
can be availed at if war should be long
drawn out.
It is probable that the immediate in
crease in revenue that will be asked
will not exceed this, though should war
be prolonged other taxes will be im
posed which will greatly increase the
receipts.
The estimates which the Secretary
had before him to-day from the Com
missioner of Internal Revenue sliotv
that if all the internal revenue taxes,
except income, which were in force in
1866, the year when the largest reve
nues were received from internal reve
nue alone, would amount to the enor
mous sum of $762,000,000 annually. It
is not believed that it will be neces
sary to go to such extremes of taxation
as weie then resorted to to meet thÂ»
enormous debt left by the Civil War.
Taxes were not only imposed on com
mercial and legal papers, an<j upon
patent medicines and proprietary arti
cles, but upon all sorts of manufactures
and upon occupations of various kinds.
Should it be necessary to raise more
than $100,000,000 additional revenue, it
is probable that the first tax resorted
to in addition to those which would be
first recommended would be stamp
taxes on commercial and legal paners,
medicines, cosmetics, toilet articles, etc.
. It is not expected that more than
$200,000,000 more a year than is. raised
under existing laws will be required,
unless war should be prolonged far be
yond the present expectations of any
one connected with the administration.
However much may be raised by tax
ation, the treasury must have a larfre
fund immediately available if war is
to be successfully prosecuted.
Of $226,000,000 now in the cash bal
ance of the treasury less than $100,000 -
000 could be safely used, having in
mind the necessity for keeping the goli
reserve intact for maintaining a work
ing balance In the sub-treasuries.
Whether or not there will be an Imme
diate issue of bonds and the amount
that Congress may be required to au
thorize are still open questions.THE EMPORIUM. THE EMPORIUM. | THE EMPORIUM. I THE^EMPORIUM. | I H -?_ EM Â£Â°i ft]r^ M : | THE EMPORIUM.

J. B. Garrett runs the ranch for A.

and his wife live in the upper story

stories high and was hard finished.
There was also a porch around it and

are attached to it now. The porch is
goneâ smashed as flat as a newly rolled
grain field; the kitchen has been torn
down and lies a half dozen feet away

structure, and the only bit of plaster
still on the walls is hidden in one of
the upstairs closets. As to the furni

unbroken.

struggled from under the heap of fur
niture and rushed downstairs to the
front door. It was jammed tight in
its frame, so they ran to the rear of
the house and got out through a great
rent in the side, caused by the dis
placing of the kitchen. At first it was
thought the gas apparatus used on the
ranch had exploded. The truth was
quickly known, but the full extent of
pranks played and the damage done
was not known until the next morn
ing.
The house had been shifted and was
practically wrecked, although the walls
still stand. Four windmill tanks were
thrown down and two of the windmills
with them. An old sink hole in the
yard, covered and half full of water,
had the boards torn from over it and
thrown far to the side, and the water
lying in it was splashed ail over the
landscape.
A ditch running from the house to
Midshipman Slough, a mile and a half
away, was emptied of its contents, and
the red mud from its bottom dyes the
ground for six feet on either side. The
ditch is five feet wide and there was
at least two feet of water in it. So
noma Creek kicked up its heels and
ran up its banks until it flooded all
the lÃnd unprottcted by levees, and
in some places it even splashed over
these, something it has never done be
fore. The levees are cracked in places,
and the creek bank seems loosened, but
not badly except in spots.
Barn doors were thrown open, one
pair of them breaking a stout plank

AUCTION SALES.
By G. H. Umbsen-Monday, April I, Real Estate, at 11 Mont-
mery street, at 12 o'clock.
MR, LACEY'S FRfINK FR'END.
A CONSTITUENT of Representative Lacey of
lowa has sent to him for a copy of every
obituary to be found among the archives of
the House. "I do so love to read about dead Con
gressmen," explains the person making the request.
Perhaps this is a specimen of irony as she irons in
lowa, or it may be that Mr. Lacey's frank friend has
a touch of that morbid trait which leads certain na
tures to the place of mourning, there to find a pleas
ure such as another would seek at the play.
To the ordinary intelligence the privilege of read
ing about dead Congressmen does not actively ap
peal. In fact when a member dies there is apt to be
more said concerning him than his importance in the
world would justify, and the habit of skipping the
long eulogies has been acquired even by the most en
thusiastic devourers of the Congressional Record.
But there are a few Congressmen who might im
prove the public sen-ice by dropping out of it and
getting into a condition to be embalmed in epitaph.
Yet these epitaphs would be read without the reader
manifesting signs of jubilation or more than a se
rene content. Lacey could not be blamed for declin
ing to be a purveyor of funeral sweets to a crank.
AN ISSUE ThjAT LIVES.
ALTHOUGH the Loud bill designed to make
the postofhee self-sustaining has been defeated,
and notwithstanding the fact that the postal
appropriation bill for the ensuing year has been
adopted by the House, the question of postal deficits
continues to occupy more attention in the East than
any other issue of national legislation except that re
lating to Cuba and national defense. It seems that
the business sense of the country has about made up
its mind that something shall be done to place the
postoffice on a business basis and will not let the
issue die until that has been accomplished.
The Loud plan of putting an end to the deficit by
restricting the privilege of second class postage to
legitimate newspapers having been defeated, the next
plan to be tried is that of those who urge a reduction
of the rates paid to railroads for transportation.
There are many advocates of this plan outside of
Congress and some strong champions of it in that
body. It would seem, therefore, as if the plan might
be embodied in a bill and brought up for considera
tion before the Senate follows the House in disposing
of the matter for this session.
The Philadelphia City and State, in discussing
the cost of transportation, recalls the statement of
ex-Postmaster-General Vilas that the Government is
."paying for the use of postal cars more than a-, mil
lion dollars a year in excess of what it cost to build
the cars," and denounces the rates as "a gigantic
thievery." The Springfield Republican declares the
scandal of the situation falls upon Congress no less
than upon the administration of the Postal Depart
ment, which is empovered to make terms with the
railroads, and, quoting Senator Gorman, attributes
the failure of Congress to make any effort at reform
to "the great power of these corporations who control
even-thing, who are so powerful that they make and
unmake public men."
Evidence in abundance, and much of it seemingly
conclusive, has been advanced from time to time in
proof of these assertions. It is somewhat strange,
therefore, that no attempt has been made to bring the
issue fairly before Congress so that the subject could
be discussed on its merits. The argument of exces
sive railroad rates was used effectively as a weapon to
kill the Loud bill, but it was not strong enough to
kill the appropriation bill, although the appropriations
for transportation were made on the old basis.
It is time to put an end to this sort of juggling
on a matter of such importance to the country; The
advocates of lower rates should bring in a measure
dealing with the issue. They should come forward
with a well-defined policy. The postal deficit is a
serious evil, but the reported domination of Congress
by railroads is a greater evil still if it be true, and
it behooves those who claim to be free from that
domination to make a straight fight and show their
hands at some time before the session closes and the
people are called on to pass judgment upon their
official acts.
News that Zola is freed will be received even-where
with satisfaction. Perhaps Zola does talk too much, but
his excess in this direction is as nothing compared with
his habit of writing too much. However, if France
did not intend to keep the gentleman in jail it is hard
to understand why she made such a show of herself
in an endeavor to establish the right to put him there.
If the Queen Regent of Spain gets scared away
from that troubled land by the Carlists she ought to
come to this country, where she would be received
with courtesy and treated to the attentions due a
lady of rank.
Peace is so blessed a thing that the country is will
irÂ« ta devote .its ,atnÂ»; ? Q "-thc'seciy; q! it,
THE BORDERLAND OF STRIFE.
UNLESS events shall as by a miracle be changed
in the aspect they now present to human judg
ment, this country and Spain will soon be en
gaged in deadly strife. Of the outcome America has
nothing to fear. That its quarrel is just gives it triple
strength, and aside from the moral phase of the con
tention its material resources are vastly greater than
those of its foe. In sentiment it is united. That the
national honor must be maintained is a statement
over which there is no tendency to haggle, and the
national honor is at stake.
It will be satisfactory to the people of this country
to know that the final resolution to strike a blow at
the arrogance of an ancient and decaying monarchy
is based upon the murder of our seamen, for this, de
spite any diplomatic expression, is the real explana
tion. When the Maine went down it carried with it
the hope of Spain. The mine which wrecked the ship
was destined to hurl the Castilian from power in the
western hemisphere, and its re% r erberations may j - et
change a dynasty. Still, for some reason, there was
for a time an effort to dismiss this unexampled ex
hibition of treachery as a minor incident. The peo
ple refused to have it dismissed, and no sounding
phrases can blind them to the truth.
If, .when the battle-ship was sent to the bottom,
Spain had offered condolence, if she had denounced
the perpetrators as assassins and hunted them out,
the event which is to lead to war might have opened
a way to peace. In sympathy there is at least the be
ginning of friendship. But from the first Spain as
sumed the attitude of defiant guilt. A calm and im
partial investigation proved that the responsibility
rested upon her, and though the actual deed may have
been that of an unauthorized enthusiast, Spain vol
untarily took the position of an accessory, and with
the brazenness of the hardened criminal has refused
to listen to reason, has been dead to all the impulses
of humanity and fairness. Now the penalty be upon
her, and if in fire and blood she reap a dread harvest,
history will record that it was of her own sowing.
While there was hope of honorable peace no pa
per of influence, no man of standing, urged the Presi
dent or Congress to extreme measures. But this hope
vanished when there was an attempt to have the
Maine incident thrust aside as trivial. Had such a
course been permitted no American ship but would
have been the safe target of any country with a fan
cied grievance, and the American flag, instead of
being a protection to those beneath it. would have
been an invitation for the heaping of indignity upon
subjects to whom its shadow should be, and shall be,
a shield.
Even if the ostensible ground for war be that Cuba's
chains have long enough bound her to oppression, the
real ground is the destruction of the Maine. Only for
this the United States could not have interfered; only
for this it would not have been moved by a concerted
desire to interfere. Cuba has. fought long and well
and vainly. There is no way of telling how much
longer she might have struggled. But a new and
greater power takes the burden from her. She may
think that contemplation of her bravery and suffering
caused it. It is not so. In the bleaching bones of the
Maine, in the graves of our murdered men, she may
read the true story of her own salvation.
SPAIN'S TORPEDO FLOTILLA.
IF the administration has made any mistake in its
conduct of the diplomatic controversy precipitated
by the blowing up of the battle-ship Maine in Ha
vana harbor it has been in permitting the Spanish
torpedo flotilla to start for the West India Islands.
The arrival of the torpedo flotilla at the probable
; seat of battle would place Spain upon a war footing
|on this side of the Atlantic. Although Spain did
! nothing but send her men-of-war into her own waters,
the dispatch of these boats from the home country
j was a distinctly hostile act. The purpose of Spain
; may not have been to irritate the people of the
I United States, but her action in transferring so for
midable a fleet at a time when relations were so
I strained can be considered from no other standpoint
than that she has been determined' from the start to
precipitate a conflict. Certainly the presence of this
; torpedo flotilla near Cuba could do nothing toward
I promoting peace. The American people are too
| numerous and their resources too great for such a
presence to frighten them. In other words, the Span
1 ish Government blunders when it thinks that the
Americans can be bulldozed.
The dispatch of the flotilla may, however, prove
that President McKinley has all along made a mis
take in attempting to reach peaceful conclusions with
the "Dons." If a war shall now come, as seems ex
tremely probable, these torpedo boats will inflict a
great deal of damage upon the American fleets. It is
the opinion of naval experts that Spain is now as
strong in Cuban waters as we are. If that be the
case the impending conflict will be simply a test of
fighting qualities. If the Spanis-h can throw as much
vigur into the management of their ships as they have
thrown into their diplomacy they will be likely to put
up a rather strong fight.
But of course there can be no question as to the
final result. An effete and bankrupt nation like Spain
cannot continue a naval struggle against a nation like
the United States any great length of time.
SOME PENALTY FOR SLAUGHTER.
INSPIRING the suit brought by the widow of
Lieutenant Burke against his slayer is such an
evident justice that there can be no harm in com
menting upon a matter, yet to be adjudicated by the
proper tribunal. So often has a murderer been al
lowed to escape that every step tending to express
disapproval of his act is certain to be applauded.
A man cherishing the homicidal tendency, and cer
tain to be hanged for permitting it to lead him to the
act of crime, would repress the impulse and remain
with hands unstained. If assured in advance that
even if not dropped through the gallows trap he
would spend the balance of his days in prison, he
might curb his desires and ultimately die a free man,
succumbing to old age, his neighbors not suspecting
how close he had been to the shedding of blood.
Yet the man who killed Burke seems to have been
so constituted that goM to him is more than life or
liberty. There could be no penalty more certain to
awaken in him such shred of conscience as he may
possess than one prescribing that he forfeit to those
whom he deprived of support the hoard he spent
years in collecting. In the abstract the contention of
the widow seems unassailable, and in the particular
case under consideration the conditions are especially
against the assassin. He cannot plead even the
shadow of justification. Of course by establishing an
allegation of insanity he would render invalid any
claim Mrs. Burke might bring, as well as save his
neck, either contingency one much to be regretted
by the public.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,- SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
THE INTERSTATE CONVENTION.
rROM the readiness with which Governors of
various States of the Great West have agreed
to co-operate in the project, and from the cor
dial approval with which it has been almost univer
sally received in all parts of this State, it is evident
the proposed celebration of the semi-centennial of
the admission of California to statehood will be car
ried to a splendid success if the right impulse is
given to the movement before the present ardor fails
and the sanguine hopes of the people are weakened
by postponements and delays.
The enterprise, having been virtually launched,
should be kept moving from this time on. The
sooner definite plans are adopted the better. The
project will gain in strength by acquiring a well
defined iorm and purpose. There will be a greater
readiness on the part of men of energy and influence
to assist in the undertaking when they can see more
clearly the good that is to be accomplished by it and
wherein they can aid it. For all these reasons some
action in the direction of formulating a programme
for the enterprise should be prepared for at once and
adopted as soon as possible.
The first definite step to be taken is necessarily
that of calling the proposed interstate convention to
consider the project Nothing in the way of plans
can be permanently decided upon until that conven
tion meets, for the convention will have the deciding
voice as to the place of holding the exposition and
the time when it shall be opened. It is therefore a
matter of considerable importance to have the con
vention assemble at an early date, and to this object
the committee having the enterprise in charge should
direct their attention without delay.
One reason why the convention should assemble
as speedily as is consistent with a good attendance
from all the Western States is the desirability of
getting the enterprise well under way before next
winter so that appropriations may be obtained for it
at that time from the Legislature and from Con
gress. For the purpose of getting a Congressional
appropriation it seems indeed that prompt action is
imperative. Philadelphia has already asked for an
appropriation for an exposition in 1809, and a move
ment has been started in New York to ask for a
grant of money to that city for one in 1001. If we
delay in putting forward our claims some other city
may precede us in asking an appropriation for 1900,
and then our chances of obtaining a grant will be
greatly diminished.
While it is by no means certain that the proposed
convention will select San Francisco as the place
for holding the exposition, it is to this city that the
whole West looks for leadership in the movement.
It is here the convention should assemble. The com
mittee appointed by Mayor Phelan should" therefore
arrange for it and hasten its coming as far as pos
sible. The whole enterprise, in fact, is now waiting
on the convention, and delay, if prolonged to ex
cess, will impair the enthusiasm upon which the
movement largely depends for success.
THE TflX-PAYING CLASS.
WHEN Benjamin Harrison on Washington's
birthday delivered in Chicago his address on
the evils of tax-shirking by the rich and
uttered his famous warning that this country cannot
continue half taxed and half untaxed his statement of
facts was generally accepted as correct, and on that
basis his conclusions were widely approved and com
mended.
It appears, however, that there was at least one
man in the nation who did not accept the statement
of the ex-President. This was W. W. Baldwin of Bur
lington, lowa. Not having any data ready to his
hand by which to refute the premises of the emi
nent orator, he set about gathering them from the
tax-rolls of his own city, and has recently made pub
lic the results of his search in an array of statistics
which show that in Burlington, at any rate, it is not
the so-called poor people, but the rich, or at least the
well-to-do, who pay nearly the entire cost of the muni
cipal government.
According to Mr. Baldwin the city of Burlington,
by a census taken in 1895, had a population of 25,246,
of whom 13.990 were adults, 6849 being men, and of
these 6653 were voters. The records show that the
general taxes of the city were paid by 4,038 persons,
of whom 839 were women. Thus more than half of
the voters paid no tax at all, and out of the whole
number of adults more than two-thirds, or over 71
per cent, paid no tax.
Among the taxpayers there were 1896 whose prop
erty was valued at less than $300 each, and whose
aggregate taxes amounted to less than 10 per cent
of the whole amount raised. Thus it appears that
about 14 per cent of the adult population pay virtually
the whole amount of municipal taxes. Even among
these, moreover, the taxation is very unevenly di
vided. The twenty-two largest taxpayers, together
with three national banks and six corporations, pay
fully one-third of the whole amount, and the re
mainder is paid by some 2000 citizens who represent
the prosperous well-to-do business men of the com
munity.
Mr. Baldwin claims that Burlington may be taken
as a fairly representative American city and that the
conditions there are not widely different from those
in other cities of the country. He therefore main
tains that three-fourths of the adult urban population
of the United States pay no taxes, and that these in
clude all that can be called poor. Hence he concludes
that the dictum of General Harrison was not founded
upon truth and that the conclusions drawn from his
statement of facts were unwarranted.
The argument, of which we have given but a sum
mary, is a good one, but it does not fairly meet the
point to which it was addressed. Mr. Harrison did
not say that men of moderate wealth like the good
citizens of Burlington do not pay their share of
taxes, nor did his words carry any such implication.
His charge was directed against the giant corpora
tions, monopolies and plutocrats of the larger cities
of the Union. If Mr. Baldwin will transfer the scene
of his studies from Burlington to Chicago and find
on the records there that the greater millionaires pay
in proportion to their wealth as much as the average
citizen of means, he will have refuted Mr. Harrison,
but not until then. In the meantime, however, he has
made an interesting study of municipal taxation in
an average American community, and for that he
merits the thanks of all who are interested in such
subjects.
When Sherman shall retire to make way for Har
rison as Secretary of State the heavens will fall with
that dull, sickening thud which has been so exten
sively advertised.
It will be interesting to notice how the practice of
putting in bids for public work after the work has
been performed will strike the Grand Jury's sense of
propriety.

"Some Philosophy of the Hermetics"
has been sent to me. It is a volume
fairly reeking with mysticism. One es
pies the symbol on its cover, and picks
it up with awe. I have read the book
and must confess that it conveys noth
ing to me save that the Hermetics must
have something the matter with them.
Their philosophy presents every aspect
of having been dreamed in a lunatic
asylum. It is an emotion, not clearly
defined. It is a gasp of the eager theo
rist as he strains after the unattain
able. Needless to say, he doesn't get
it, and there are in this book evi
dences of the fact that his disappoint
ment is considerable. He asks us all
to jhare this, and we cannot; we are
gross. We recognize that the difficulty
of grabbing the unattainable is a seri
ous matter, yet having other things to
bother us, let the unattainable slide.
Yes, we are gross. But before attempt
ing to criticize the book I intend to
read it again. Its title page announces
that there are those "who will see, and
seeing will perceive." Perhaps I may
be educated up to a place among them
and learn to repent of to-day's frivol
ity. At present I believe the "Philos
ophy" but a record of vague impres
sions, such impressions as a vision of
the day or night may leave, too dim
and fading to be portrayed, too deli
cate to be transmitted to the senses
through the medium of cold type. Ev
ery mind seems to catch glimpses of
lives it has known or is to know, and
feels yearnings it can neither analyze
nor account for. In ordinary cases this
leads to the writing of poetry, in which
love and dove are sure to poise at the
ends of two lines, while gloom and
tomb are almost certain elements. In
the case of an Hermetic, however, the
effect is different.

There must be a reason for unloading
poetry upon me. I wake up In the nigfit
wondering what it is and wondering
also if the reason is good why some of
the poetry is not. Here is Cecil Vere
with a song of spring. I would not de
preciate the beauteous season when
birds begin to carol and the little buds
to venture forth. Neither would I de
preciate the soulfulness of the singer.
I hasten to assure Cecil, however, that
spring is an annual occurrence, and
really nothing to get excited about. Let
it be made clear again that I approach
a poem with modesty, realizing that
failure to discern its merits may be a
personal weakness. Yet I will go so
far as to say that Cecil would be wise
and kind were she to warble soft and
low until her muse shall be a little
steadier on its wings and feet. For in
stance:
And the vl'let's breath, and the vi'let's
breath
Brings a feeling most divine;
Nature, unto death, nature, unto death
I will be thine.
The plan of being nature's unto death
and even later is a hard one to get
away from. It was all arranged before
the earliest song-burst fell upon the
ears of the new-created. But why leave
an "o" out of violets? Why eliminate
a particular superfluous foot and leave
a lot more just as superfluous? Better
eliminate "em all and use the blank
paper which would remain to Inscribe
with a resolution of reform. I do not
wish to hurt Cecil's feelings. At some
period a girl is apt to think herself
stirred by the spirit of poesy. She gen
erally survives it and a few words of
plain advice have been known to hasten
the process of recovery.

A peculiar person, whose excuse for
getting into print must be left to the
puzzle editor, accuses me of imitating
Bierce. Anybody writing a personal
column for a Californian paper must
expect from time to time to writhe and
perspire bloodily under a similar accu
sation, unless, as the peculiar person
hereinbefore mentioned, safe-guarded
by his own stupidity. Among certain
scribes there exists a provincial igno
rance best concealed while they reihain
at their level, reporting the current
dog-fight or calling some citizen from
his bed to ask if it is true he had sto
len a partner's money and contemplat
ed eloping with the servant girl. But
when these rise higher, and essay to
think, they cannot even understand
that they have nothing to think with.
It becomes a duty and a subdued pleas
ure to discourage them. Years before
I had the honor of knowing there was
a Bierce on earth, I wrote for an East
ern paper as now for this. Reward
was largely in knowing the work at
tracted the attention of people with
brains. But it also attracted the inev
itable ass, who, rearing on his hind
legs and clearing his throat of hamper
ing hayseed, brayed that I was imitat
ing somebody or another. Thank heav
en he never went so far as to intimate
that I was- imitatir~ him. The local
brayer is simply possessed of the no
tion that Bierce is the only writer there
is or has any right to be. His
meager knowledge does not permit him
to be aware of facts plain enough to
persons endowed with sense.

It would be thought from Bismarck's
latest remarks that his neuralgia had
taken a turn for the worse. He says,
in the language of diplomacy, that the
diplomats of the United States are jays,
and that the affairs of Spain are be
ing conducted by a lot of poli3hed
knaves. Not only does this give an
inkling as to the physical condition of
the prince, but calls to mind that the
only real diplomatist is an elderly Ger

Several days ago the papers had ac
counts of the marriage of a man named
Oswald to his niece. Even with the
iniquitous habit of employing a tug
boat and the three-mile line to defy the
law and decent usages it is not often
there has been an offense so flagrant
as this. I have been expecting to see
some mention of Oswald's arrest as
well as that of the woman and the
person who officiated at the mock wed
ding. If anything of the kind has ap
peared I overlooked it. The statutes on
this particular point are clear. If this
precious trio go unpunished they are

One friendly critic has found fault
with me for not mentioning Ambrose
Bierce in a recent article touching upon
the merits the two Bret Hartes, the
one of the West and the long ago, and
the one of England and the present.
The occasion did not seem to me to re
quire it. The reputation of Bierce is
secure. In the field he has chosen
Bierce is without a peer. He has the
power to make the shadows he creates
quiver with horror, to portray the pas
sion of fear as no other has done it.
Under the spell of his imaginings the
nerves creep and sleep flees away.
There may be question as to the utility
of employing so strange a gift, yet if
it must be asked as to the work of
Bierce so also must it of that of Poe,
De Quincey and De Maupassant. What
he may or may not do in the newspa
pers is of little consequence. Good or
bad, in an hour it is forgotten. At its
best it displays weakness of which
there is never a hint in his books. .

Comes forward by post another sam
ple of the trouble I am delighted to
share with friends. - The signature Is
withheld because it happens to be the
writer's real name. This verse is the
first of a number, and by dropping it
and the several coming after, the pome
would be notably improved. I leave
the justice of this verdict to readers:
What color's conceded the fairest on
earth?
Our flag 1 .
In liberty's cause came forth souls of
true worth,
And with travail for freedom was brought
to its birth,
Our flag.
There can be no fault found with the
sentiment, which, so far as it can be
discerned among the wreck of words
and punctuation, is distinctly patriotic.
The expression of it lacks coherency,
leaving too much to be guessed at. I
do not favor the publication of the
entire pome, but there might be a use
for it. Let some of our rabid-fire
Congressmen commit it to memory,
spout it through a megaphone pointed
in the direction of the Spanish flotilla
and the torpedo-boats will whirl around
with so short a turn that they may
break their own backs.
It Is not a duty imposed upon me to
try cases which have been through the
courts. Therefore, the fact that Dr.
Hall has been acquitted again is mere
ly recorded here, despite my impulse
to add an expression of belief that he
ought to have been hanged long ago.
It may be that Hall is an angel of
light, on earth for the purpose of do
ing good works. At any rate, there
must be some reason for the consider
ation shown him. When he desires ac
quittal it is only necessary for him to
assist a patient to leave this world of
woe. Then he is tried, his guilt made
manifest, and released. lam inclined
to believe that these experiences which
to some doctors would be disagreeabla
awaken within the bosom of Hall an
emotion of pleasure.
With every passing day I grow more
confident that woman's right to be
treated as a sane and sensible entity
cannot be reasonably disputed. When
a man has had a mother, and perhaps
acquired a wife, or vainly sought one, it is
not easy to see why he should desire
to pose as a superior creature. He
knows the bluff is palpable. There is
no sense in treating women as though
they were incapable of behaving them
selves, or in making the stupid pre
tense that because a lady or a group of
ladies may have the joy of being with
out a male escort, they lack thereby
any element of respectability. I no
tice in a certain restaurant to which
people resort after the theater to lunch
and listen to music, that women unes
corted of gentleman or gent are sent
into side rooms, curtained off from the
main hall. The unattached gentleman
or gent goes where he pleases, and if
he choose to tag the ladies into their
exile under the pavement, there is
nothing to hinder. Now, why is all
this nonsense? Surely if it is for the
protection of the ladies it is a failure.
They would, in the main hall, be far
safer from the ogling of Impertinent
snips who are given to this form of
insulting attention than in a side room
cut off from general observation. I be
lieve a woman has just the same right
in a restaurant that a man has, and
that any other view of the case is an
affront to her. Observation has led me
to think she has a habit of conducting
herself with the utmost propriety. At
least, if the boss of the place is deter
mined to keep up this fool distinction,
he ought to allot to the ladies an apart
ment as well lighted and ventilated
and of as good acoustic properties as
the one from which they are banished.
And if the men who visit the restaurant
in question are not fit for ladies to as
sociate with in the casual contact of
elbows, in the full glare of electric
lights, It is time to yell for the police
and close up the concern as dangerous
to the morals of the community.
With a pessimism almost unneces
sary some people are already counting
the pension list to arise from the war
with Spain. They seem to take for
granted that because the Government
has been robbed once, it will be taken
in again. This is hardly giving the
legislative branch of the concern credit
for intelligence. Indeed, as soon as
Spain shall have been given a lesson
in manners, would be a good time for
purging the pension roll of fraud. This
task would not be a hard one; it would
be objectionable to no honest pensioner
and it would not reflect discredit on
the old soldier. To the pension he
draws he is more than welcome. By
publishing the list alone, a great re
form would be worked. There are rich
men receiving pay they do not need
for services never rendered, who
would be ashamed to see themselves in
print as treasury vampires, and there
are thousands of lesser swindlers for
whom exposure would make easy the
path to the penitentiary.
The policemen accused of cowardice

FIGURES FOR FARMERS.
One of the strongest appeals made in
support of the silver issue was that its
adoption meant improvement in all farm
productions. The absurdity of the claim
has been demonstrated time and again,
but never so conclusively as by a statis
tician who recently has investigated in
detail the course of silver and farm prod
ucts in the twenty-one months since the
adoption of the silver proposition by the
Democratic convention at Chicago in
1596 and finds that in practically every
case farm products have advanced at
about as rapid a rate as silver has fallen
meanwhile. The following table shows
that while silver fell from 69.2 cents per
ounce on July 10. 1596. to 54.3 cents â¢ on
March 10, ISPS, wheat advanced from. 63. a

FIGHTING BY MACHINERY.
Warfare, like manufacturing, has de
generated into machine work. The prep
arations for a real or apparent danger of
war make this conspicuous. The great
battleships are fighting machines not con
structed to kill human beings but to at
tack and destroy or disable other fighting
machines like themselves. To man such
fighting engines requires a small forco,
and a battle with a modern ordnance does
not of necessity involve great carnage.
This was exemplified in the Japa-nese-Chi
nese conflict. In fact, nations settle their
contentions by a mere comparison of
strength with that of their antagonistâ
a quick estimate of their own fighting
machines, their armor and armament,
their speed and coal capacity. A like esti
mate of the enemy, a footing of figures
and the battle is postponed by one or
the other belligerent to enable further
preparation and augmentation of the en
ginery of modern warfare.â Chicago Rec

Henry George, son of the famous Plng!e-tax advocate, who has succeeded
hie father as the leader of that party, is at the Occidental, where he ax
rived yesterday from New York, accompanied by his wife.
Mr. George is out here with the twofold object of visiting old friends and
collecting data for the biogTaphy of his father, which he te at present en
gaged in writing.
The late Henry George was a native of Philadelphia, but came to Cali
fornia while a mere boy. He at first learned and practiced the trade of a
printer, but eventually drifted into journalism, being at one time associated
â with Railroad Commissioner Hinton in the management of an evening; paper.
It was while in this city that he first took up the study o-f political economy
that resulted in his giving t" the world the volume on that subject that has
made his name famous, "Progress and Poverty."
Henry George Jr. was also apprenticed to the printers' trade, but only
kep* it long enough to get a fairly good idea of the business, when he accom
panied his parents to- New York, where he has since resided, engaging in
various businesses, but always keeping in touch with the party that his
father had created, and by whom he was nominated for the Mayoralty of
New York when death removed that gentleman from the political field.
Mr. George will gather together all the earlier writings of his father, be
sides collecting as many a? possible of the incidents of his life that can be
obtained fro-m the reminiscences of his father's old associates. On his return
to the East Mr. George will make a trip to England for the same -nrpose
that has brought him here, and when the biography is completed he says he
Intends devoting the rest of his life to furthering the single-tax cause.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
ARMY AND NAVY
GETTING READY
General W. R. Shafter's
Tour of Inspection
to San Diego.
Immediate Purchase of Mate
rial for Mare Island Author
ized by Wire.
Executive Officer James W. Carlin
Temporarily Command* the
Monterey.
The Adjutant General of the United
States army is accredited with the state
ment that the military forces of the
country are ready for war. The army is
not large, but it is in readiness for any
.service required. This department, under
the direction of General Shafter, has
kept pace with others In the work of
preparation. It Is believed by competent
military judges that the guns now In po
sition to defend this harbor are sufficient
to stand off a licet of iron-clads. The
engineers have the torpedo system in
such shape that floating torpedoes and
submarine mines can be applied with
! little delay.
General Shafter, accompanied by Lleu
i tenant R. 11. Noble and Lieutenant John
! D. Mlley of his staff, is about to leave
| the city for an inspection of the fortifi
| cations of San Diego. The General's tour
of inspection may embrace other points
on the coast between San Francisco and
San Diego. It is known that Monterey,
j Sajita Cruz, Santa Barbara and San Luis
I Obispo are unprotected. No doubt, in the
event of war. State troops would be
called upon to guard against the approach
of an enemy that might seek to land from
a cruiser or privateer and make a raid
; on some of the unprotected towns of the
coast. Spain has no coaling station in
I these waters, hence no formidable demon
stration on the Pacific is expected, but a
cruiser supplied at Manilla for a long
j voyage might venture on a raid against
i unprotected towns.
Since the arrival at the Presidio of an
| additional buttery from Angel Island the
i work of the artillerymen has been some
what lightened. The disappearing car
riage for the latest twelve-ince rifle is
nn the rail and will be here in a short
time. The gun weighs fifty-nine tons.
The weight of the carriage is IS4 tons.
The Navy Department has authorized
by wire the Immediate purchase in San
Francisco of supplies, material and ap
paratus to replace the appliances dam
j aged and destroyed at Mare Island by the
| recent earthquake. Assistant Naval In
structor Thomas F. Ruhn, U. S. N., was
j In the city yesterday on official business
j connection with the purchase of material.
Lieutenant-Commander James W. Car
j lin, executive officer of the Monterey, is
I temporarily in command of the coast de-
I fense vessel. Carlin appreciates the gor>d
! points of the Monterey as a fighter, but
would not object to a transfer to a sta
tion nearer the scene of big naval oper
ations on the Atlantic.
Commander Carlin Is regarded as one
of the ablest and most progressive offi
cers in the navy. He was highly com
mended In the official reports for heroism
on the Vandalia during the great hurri
cane at Apia, Should the fortunes of war
give him an important station where
fighting is to be done, he would render
the country most excellent service.
More Schoolhouses Needed.
Residents of the Mission road and Silver
Heights are preparing to make a vigorous
campaign in advocacy of more school
houses in that section of the city. They
contend that they have had to send their
children into cow sheds and barns during
the past year for want of proper schools.
KILLED AT HIS POST.
Patrick McHugh, a Morse Patrol
man, Stepped Into an Elevator
Shaft in the Dark.
Patrick McHugh, a member of Morse's
patrol, was found dead at a quarter past
Bix o'clock yesterday morning in the cab
inet shop of A. J. Forbes at 213 Mission
street.
Mr. Forbes, on opening the shop, dis
covered the dead watchman lying in the
elevator shaft on the ground" floor. The
deceased had evidently fallen through
the shaft from the second floor while
making his rounds of inspection for in
cipient fires and lurking burglars He
had reported by telegraph to the Morse
patrol headquarters at 4 o'clock, and it
Is believed that he met his death shortly
afterward. He did not carry a lantern,
and stepped unawares into the shaft
McHugh resided with his wife and child
at 210 First street. At the Morgue an
autopsy by Surgeon Gallagher revealed
a fractured skul) as the cause of death

THIEVES ENTER
A NEW FIELD
Mrs. Sullivan, Living at 826^
Alabama Street, Minus a
Ring and $40.
Reports to the Police That an Old-
Time Neiyhbor and Friend Is
Suspected.
Seemingly thieves have entered a new !
field, for last evening Mrs. Sullivan re
ported to police headquarters that she '<
.lives at 826>,i Alabama street, and that she
is poorer $40 and a valuable gold ring than i
â¢on recent previous occasions.
In company with her son the complain- j
ant tailed at the office early last evening |
and stated that she had left her home 'â 
early in the morning but a few days ago !
with her valuables secreted on her per- i
son. securely tied in her handkerchief !
While In a grocery-store in the neighbor
hood of her home she had placed her coat
With the money and ring in the rear and i
when she returned the ring and the I
money, with the exception of $10 in sil- !
ver, was missing.
From the report made a lady, who was I
formerly a friend of the family, is sus
pected of the theft, but no direct charges
; have been made, as it is thought detec
tives may bring to light other interesting
developments.
The robbed woman had left her !
coat for about three - quarters of
an hour. and, although she states
that she regrets losing the money,
she is heart-broken over the loss of the
ring, which had been in her possession for
many years.
While both Mrs. Sullivan and her son ;
state that they are positive who commit
ted the theft, they are unwilling to more i
than hint at their suspicions, but as the !
parties were advised to swear out war
rants for the suspected person, some in
teresttng developments may follow.
The police are of tho opinion that the
complainant has mislaid hÂ«r valuables |
but she Is positive that she carried them
with her on the morning of the .-illeg-p<l
theft, and her statements are corroborat
ed by her son.
MYSTERY AND A
SUDDEN DEATH
A Will Left by Captain C.
Hanson Worrying
Relatives.
A Clause Which Bequeaths
$13,000 to an Unknown
Party Is the Cause.
Attorney William H. Jordan, Who
Drew Up ihe Document, Await
ing a Claimant for the Amount
Captain Charles Hanson, deceased,
has left behind him a will which is
as mystettous in certain portions to the
relatives of his family as it is to At
torney William H. Jordan, who drew
yf> the document. The clause which
so upset and bewildered all con
nected with the case states that $13,
000 from the amount left by him at the
time of his death shall be paid to a
certain unknown persen without hin
drance or question at any time that
person shall deliver to the attorney a
note introducing himself or herself as
the party entitled to the amount named
in the will.
Captain Hanson was a stockholder
in the Tacoma Mill Company and, be
sides, was interested in other paying
business ventures. At the time of his
death the attorney held the will and
the members of the family were soon
afterward notified of its contents. The
interest in the Tacoma Mill Company
was virtually thte entire fortune pos
sessed by the deceased prior to his
death, but the will when read directed
that $5000 should go to Miss Grace Mer
ritt, $2500 to Mr. H. C. Chesebrough,
his former manager, and also to the
same party one-quarter of his interest
in the mill company. Of course one
half of the community property re
verts to the widow without question,
but the clause which followed has been
discovered to be a source of annoyance.
Just who the mysterious party is has
not yet been determined by relatives,
manager or attorney, but the statement
in the will was followed by the amount
which should be given to the son. The
remaining portion of the community
property was placed in trust with Sam
uel G. Murphy, H. C. Chesebrough and
Attorney Jordan to be held for five
years, and in case the son, William
Hanson, is living at the end of five
years the amount shall be turned over
to him, as well as $1000 provided for.
For weeks past the relatives and at
torney in the case have been waiting
patiently to hear from the party whu
will present the note which will place
in his or her hands a snug sum, but
so far no word or rumor has been pre
sented which would give the slightest
clew to the unknown. Attorney Jor
dan states that at the time he drew r up
the will he was rather anxious ana
curious to know who the party was that
might some day enter his office to re
ceive the amount left him, but no in
formation could be gained through close
questioning.
Many points have been looked into
and many reasons for the queer actions
MISS ADA THALL, WHO WILL SEEK FAME AND FORTUNE
UPON THE STAGE,
Another native daughter of California will seek the famelit laurels of the
stage. The Thespian fire that force of circumstances has caused to smolder for
these many years has broken forth into the bright flame of reality, and upon
the 13th inst. of this month Miss *da E. Thall of 1324% O'Farrell street will Join
the Corbett Company and travel with thf?m back to gay New York, where next
season she will make her initial bow before the footlights.
Many of California's daughters have achieved success upon the iL'tage, and
this has been an incentive to urge Miss Thall to a high ambition. For some time
she has been one of the salesladies in Thors' Photograph Company. Miss Thall
talks very modestly about what she hopes to do. She realizes that her venture
means work, and that many have failed, where few have won renown and fame>
Miss Thall is 19 years of p"-o and very pretty. She is small of stature, and
her general appearance and contour of figure closely resemble that of Anna
Held. Miss Thall's claims to the petite and chic are sufficiently pronounced to
attract attention for her anywhere she may go. Sh,e is a most accomplished mu
sician, and plays the piano most artistically and with great expression.
Miss Thall hopes to make her mark in comedy, and along this line she will
devote herself with much energy. She has many friends here who wish her
success in her venture, and who 'expect in a few seasons to welcome her back
as one of the brightest stars of the theatrical solar system.
j of the deceased gone over, but as yet
i the entire matter remains in darkness
i so far as the party or parties are con
cerned. It is thought just possible that
some one not entitled to the amount
may appear with a note for the amount.
I but the attorney is confident he will
! recognize the handwriting of the one
j for whom he drew up the document
I which may yet result in unforeseen legal
! tangles.

Chicago. He did an enormous business
that allowed him. -to keep a fine residence
on Michigan .avenoe, attached '> to which
was a stable filled, with the best blooded
horseflesh that money could procure. In
charge of this stable was a young Irish
man by the name of O'Caflahan, who
came of one of the best families in Dub
lin, but who, through wildness and a
love of adventure which had carried him
all over the world, was forced to occupy
the menial position which his knowledge
of matters equine procured for him in
the rich man's stable. One night a little
small-and-early was In progress on the
fourth floor of a house on Wabash ave
nue. O'Callahan was one of the guests,
and when the time came for the party
to break up he, feeling a little bit 'how
came you so,' decided to descend to the
street by the means of the flre escape,
instead of using the more conventional
avenue of egress_ by the stairs. It was
In the middle of winter, and the iron
rungs of the fire escape were heavily
coated with ice, making them so slippery
that when O'Cailahan put his feet on the
first one he only rested there for the
fraction of a second. Descending rapidly
to the sidewalk, he alighted on the back
of his head, and turning over on his
side gave a feeble hurrah and expired.
The next day, as O'Callahan did not have
a cent to his name, his friends concluded
to take up a collection la pay his funeral
expenses. Every one chipped In gener
ously as the hat was passed around, and
finally one of the crowd was dispatched
to the house of O'Callahan's employer to
acquaint that gentleman with the fact
that his faithful servant had passed in
the night, and to ask him If he would
kindly draw up a check for two weeks'
wages due O'Callahan, which could be
used toward helping to defray the ex
penses of the funeral. The visitor ar
rived- at the Michigan avenue mansion,
was admitted, stated his errand, and,
hat in hand, respectfully awaited the
coming of the check. The employer lis
tened to the story with evident interest,
but, instead of drawing up a check,
turned to his visitor and said: 'I am very
sorry, young man, but I always live up
to any business agreement 1 enter into,
and I expect others to do likewise. O'Cal
lahan was a good servant, but as he has
seen fit to leave my employ without the
customary two weeks' notice, I don't con
sider I owe him anything.' O'Callahan
was burled without the help of a check."

COURSING EVENTS AT TWO PARKS.
Puppies Ran Well at
the Ingleside Park
Yesterday.
A Long String of Fleet Old-
Timers Also Delighted
the Bettors.
During the EntirÂ© Day the Talent
Walked Off With Easy Money
on tha Results.
Some good pupa and a long string of
fleet old timers were slipped yesterday
afternoon at Ingleside Coursing Park.
The talent had everything their own way
in the run down, but it is expected that
many dumps will be received during the
ties to-day. Dempsey Lass ran a good
course in the puppy stake, as did Loy_
Boy and Bonita, and it is generally sup-"
posed that first money will go to one or
the other of the latter puppies.
Moondyne was in hi 3 usual good form
and will run way inside the money to
day. The hares were speedy without an
exception and the bettors watched the
sport with interest. One of the closest
courses of the day was between Coralie
and Tod Sloan, as they were both in
good condition and worked right up to
the hare.
Taken all In all, a good day's sport was
witnessed by a large Saturday crowd, and

CAUGHT WITH
THEIR PLUNDER
Clever Capture of Two Crooks
Who Are Wanted for
Burglary.
Richard Curtis and Burt Manson
Locked Up In the
Tanks.
Locked up in the tanks at the City
Prison are two younrr men who the police
say are responsible for a number of
burglaries committed in this city. Their
names are Richard Curtis and Burt Man
son. They were arrested last night by
Detectives Dlnan and Reynolds in a lodg
ing house on Grant avmue. When
searched a jimmy and a bunch of skele
ton keys were found in their possession.
Last Friday night the room at William
Crowley at 515 Kearney street was en
tered by means of a skeleton key and con
siderable clothing- taken. The burglary
was reported to Cflief Lees, who detailed
Dinan and Reynolds to make an investi
gation. From a description given of the
men who were seen leaving the room,
the detectives arrested Curtis and Man
son and charged them with tile crime. A
short time afterward they recovered the
stolen property in a pawnshop on Third
Btreet, where it had been sold by the
prisoners. Both the mm are known to
the police as clever crooks. After being
placed in the tanks Curtis informed the
detectives that he and his pal had com
mitted several burglaries, and also told
them what disposition they had made of
their booty. Only a few nights ago, it is
claimed, the men entered a lodging house
on Grant avenue with the intention of
holding up the inmates. They were both
armed and ready to commit murder if
they met with any interference. After
entering the house Curtis, seeing a police
man approaching, concluded that he was
aware of their plans and ho and his pal
made their escape.
ASSAULTED WITH A PITCHER.
George Griffith Found in Bed With
His Skull Fractured.
George Griffith was found in his room at
the lodging house at 32 Fourth street last
night by Thomas Ryan, in an unconscious
condition, with blood flowing from open
wounds on his head. A broken pitcher on
the floor mutely told the tale.
Griffith was taken to the Receiving
Hospital by Robert Dickson and Ulma
Peterson, where it was found that his
skull was fractured and his scalp badly
lacerated. The man was partially intox
icated, and refused to make any state
ment, but it looked to the police like a
case of attempted murder. He was last
seen in company of a certain man, and
a supposition is that the men had a quar
rel and his companion broke the pitcher
on Griffith's head. It is said that Griffith
is employed in a wholesale liquor store on
Sansome street, but he refuses to talk
about himself in any way.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan, 1017-1023 Mission.

The New Ones Learn
Something at Union
Park.
Six Heavy Falls in a Lump
Make Matters Lively Enough
for All.
Rosette Loses Caste, Though Running
to Win-Heavy Odds Ruled lor
the Day.
It wasn't the number of times the
knowing ones got dumped at Union Park
that hurt; they miscalculated only six
times in thirty-two courses. It was that
the six surprises came nearly in a lump,
when the odds were such as to shake the
bettors' confidence and make them care
ful for a while. And then, right after the
last fall, when any old thing was "ex
pected" by the wiseacre 3. the hot fa
vorite Rosette came very near losing to
Green Valley Maid, with odds at 1 to 10,
making the spinal columns of not a few
the media for alternate currents of sus
pense and despair. But n.osettte finally
won out on a long course, after a short
"no course" had been run, the hare being
killed before the merits of the contest
ing hounds could be determined. How
ever, the winner was in poor form and
had so hard a run that her chances to
win in the final rundown to-day were ma
terially lessened. Flying Buck, with
Patria or Rosette for second choice,
seems to be the pick of the best judges
now.
The day was an Ideal one for coursing,
the sun shone bright and warm, and the
hares were nearly all in fine form. A
good-sized crowd was present and the
betting was lively. The first flutter of
excitement was in the race between
Mountain Lassie anu Jimmy Hope, the
former ruling a strong favorite. The
'"short ender" had things all his own way
for a time, but the favorite finally car
ried off the honors on a long heat. This
race was merely the rumble of the thun
der warning the talent of the wrath to
come, the handwriting on the wall, aa it
were.
Almost In unbroken series then the
"short enders" had their inning. Mystery
ran away from Monotony, a 3 to 1 favor
ite; The Turk waltzed all around Pat
Molloy, odds 1 to 4; Mountain Beauty
failed to succumb to the clairvoyant
tricks of Magic, on the long end, with
odds at 4 to 1; Theron robbed Laurel
wood. a 5 to 3 favorite, of all the laurels
he ever had; Blackstone scorned all law
and raked in the prize from Move On,
favorite, with the odds at 5 to 2; Little
Pete repeated the performance in the
cake of Bessie B. a 2 to 1 favorite, and
three courses afterward Douglas rubbed
salt into the talent's sores by putting out
Santa Alecia, booked to win on a 5 to 1
shot. That ended the excitement. The
favorites had things their own way after
that.
A feature of the day was the heavy
odds given oÂ»i some of the favorites, who
luckily gave none of their backers the
heart disease. Promise Me ruled a 9 to 1
favorite over Lily Wheeler, Myrtle 6 to
1 over Fair Helen, Royal Buck the same
over Sweet Lips. Rusty Gold X to 1 over
Decorator, Camilla 7 to 1 over Rich and
Artless, while Mercy May rose high on
the tide of chance with tIH waged on her
to $1 on Premier. Rosette was a 10 to 1
favorite over Green Valley Maid, and
Lord Byron 13 to 1 over Rey Alphonso.
In the course between Promise Me and
Lily Wheeler the hare was too fleet and
Cozy for the dogs and made its escape.
The ties will be run off to-day.

KENNA TO BE BEINSTATED.
California Associated Cycling Board
Forgives Him and Cyclist Stone
for Their Rashness. .
At Its meting in the Bay City Club's
rooms last evening the California Asso
i elated Cycling Board reinstated Charles
i L. Stone and partially reinstated James
! R. Kenna, the crack amateur rider, after
I a suspension of six months for competing
j in an unsanctioned race meet.
It was by a narrow margin that the
< punishment inflicted on the young riders
| was discontinued, and It was only after
j attention had been called to the promise
of Stone, which he made in a communica
j tion to the racing board, in which he
said, "I do hereby promise to observe and
uphold all the rules of the California As
sociated Cycling Clubs and never to ride
in any race not held under its sanction."
Should Kenna make the same promise he
will be reinstated into the good graces of
the association.
A committee, consisting of H. F. "Wynne
j and T. J. Winslow. was appointed to wait
! on the Street Committee of the Super
' visors on Monday and ask them to repave
! Market street.
The Reno Wheelmen of Nevada made
application and were elected to member
ship to the association. , V ____Â»Â»
The membership and interclub. commit
tee were directed to work up a joint run
of all the clubs and wheelmen around the
city to celebrate the building of the new
boulevards and report at the next mcci
in j.' A. Woodson of the Capitol ' City
Wheelmen of Sacramento offered the fol
lowing resolution, which was adoptea.
Whereas, the Bureau of Road Inquiry of the
United States Department of AKnculture is
promoting the proposition of establishing
ings banks., with liberty to the Government to
loan the deposits at a low rate Of interest,
to towns and townships and counties for tne
purpose only of constructing highways ac
cording to systems having the approval or tne
Bureau of Road Inquiry; and whereas, me
plan has the approval and indorsement or
many Governors of States, . many engineers
leading agriculturists, skilled . financiers and
many hundreds of publicists and well wishers
of their country; therefore, Â ,
Resolved, That the "Board of Governors or
the California Associated Cycling Clubs .- ap
proves and commends the pla/i and expresses
belief In its wisdom, prudence and desirabil
ity. â . â  â ..;..
The next meeting of the association will
be held at the California Cycling Club 3
rooms at Twenty-second and Folsom
streets on May 14. as the 100-mile relay
race takes place on May 7. '
WOODMEN OP THE WORLD.
"Police Camp." as the new camp has
been termed, owing to the large number
of policemen on its roll, initiated seven
at its first meeting after institution, and
will have fifteen more candidates for its
meeting Wednesday evening. California
Jr. Camp held its first meeting last Tues
day evening, and will meet each Tuesday
until regularly instituted. A new camp
will be instituted in Red Men's Hall to
morrow evening with thirty-two charter
members. Three other camps will also
be regularly instituted in this city durin.tr
April. New camps will ' i instituted
during this month at T. lescal. Elk
Creek and Novato. During larch eight
camps were instituted in California and
359 applications for benefit membership
were received.
During March 1293 applications were re
ceived in the Pacific jurisdiction, and it
is estimated that the entire order will
show a growth of about 12.000.
Oakland Camp No. 04 has taken up the
work of organizing a new camp instead ]
of putting any more applicants into its |
own, believing that it is more to the in- j
terest of the order to have two tamps of
300 members each than one of 600. This j
is an innovation among orders of this i
class, and is likely to be followed by the â 
other large camps in the jurisdiction.
WOMEN Off WOODCRAFT.
Grand Adviser Helen M. Southwick re
ports four circles instituted during the
month of March. The Pacific Jurisdiction,
Women of Woodcraft, claim to have the
largest membership ever accorded a fra
ternal order at the same age. It was
one year of age on the 12th of March,
and already has over 2200 members.
Redwood Circle's second literary enter
tainment and dance in the social hall of
the Forester's building last Friday was
a very pleasant one, and was attended
by many members of the order. There
was a programme that included an over
ture by the orchestra, recitation by W.
Bracketta. piano duet by Miss Paulino
Sternler and Master Archie Rever, an ad
dress on woodcraft by J. L. Geary Jr.,
and an illustrated lecture "by Mr. Jen
nings, after which it was on with the
dance until midnight.
This circle, in common with the Wood
men of this jurisdiction, is making ex
tensive preparations for the entertain
ment of the delegates to the approaching
session of the head camp.
If the land surface of the globe were
divided and alloted in eaual shares to
each of its human inhabitants it would
be found that each would get a plat of
23^2 acres, but much of.it would not be
worth having.

My mother's headaches were of the sort that people call sick
headache. They always were in some way the result of a disturbed
stomach. She would have them sometimes more than once a week
and then she might go several weeks without having one. Generally
an attack would only spoil one day, but sometimes she would be sick
for two or three days. When she learned about Ripans Tabules she
found that they always relieved her decidfcdly, and her attacks are
now much less frequent than they used to be. She continues to make
use of the Tabules when occasion arises, but she says that now one or
two will not produce the effect they did in the beginning. She keeps
a supply of them in the house all the time, and I believe if she would
take them according to directions, they would cure her entirely You
know her life is that of a farmer's wife. I suppose her experience is
that of thousands of others who stay pretty closely at home and de-
pend for food mainly upon those things which the farm produces.
Under such conditions the stomach will get upset now and then unlesi
precautions are taken to avoid it. Ripans Tabules are precaution*.

yesterday. Everybody present shared In
the hard luck, the spectators to the great
est extent. The managers of the Pacific
States League came in for their allot
ment in having to stand the responsibility
of such an exhibition so early In the sea
son, while the players suffered propor
tionately for their part in the crime.
The first evidence of the hoodoo was
when the Oakland? started out from the
club house and found themselves one
man shy.- H. Krug had been announced
to play with the team, but he decided to
remain with the rival league, so the
trouble was delayed lifteen minutes while
a skirmish line was thrown across to the
City Hall and shanghaied a deputy in the
Street Department by the name of Mona
han, who only consented to become an
accessory on the promise that his iden
tity should be concealed under the alias
of Kwgan.
Then the hoodoo hypnotized the pitch
ers, the fielders and the umpires. Rube
Levy and Dave Creamer perpetrated the
latter affront, but to their credit be it
said they wer3 entirely impartial in the
matter of ingrowing decision. Foley and
Cflrbett were called out for not touching
basesâ or that was the explanation givenâ
but the impression prevailed that it was
done to reduce the offense from felony to
misdemeanor. As for balls and strikes,
they might as well have been decided by
the tossing of a quarterâ heads a strike,
tails a bail.
Four pitchers divided up a total of
forty-one hits between them, including
two homers, a triple and thirteen doubles,
while fourteen errors were distributed
among the players. Some thought that

the pitchers suffered for the benefit of
the tielders. and that some of the Â«hfÂ« .^
scored as lilts should have been charg.d
as errors, but a few more or less either
way don't matter in such a melee.
There were some mitigating circum- i

who played third for Oakland, did noth
ing in particular to distinguish himself, I
except to lose a couple of balls over left
field fence, the grounds not having been i
widened yet, as it was announced some I
time ngo would be done.
When San Jose piled up nine misdf-eds
on six hits in the lirst inning it looked
as though Oakland was out of it. but in
the second they came back with three ;
runs, while the Orchardists cut three
more notches in the third. Oakland got j
one in the fourth and both took three in j
the fifth. Then Oakland evened up mat- !
tcrs by scoring eight in tho sixth, while
Ban Jose drew a blank. They added two
more in the seventh, while Oakland tÂ£ok j
four. A quartet in the eighth put fan i
Jose again in the lead, but their an tag- !
onists flashed the winning number with
three runs. They might have kept it up
bad not Corbett been retired, ostensibly
for not touching third. The others could
not do anything in the ninth, and the '
trouble terminated as follows:

PLAYED BALL FOR KEEPS.
Oakland Defeats San Francisco
in a Rattling Contest in
Which Hard Hitting
Predominated.
The resounding whack of the ashen bat
meeting a live ball created a merry din in
Recreation Park grounds at Eighth and
Harrison streets yesterday in an exciting
game between the Athenians and the
local representatives. Baaehits, two-bag
gers and triples were as plentiful as boys
on the fence, and, judging by the fine at
tendance, the grounds had scored a hit.
Free cars and a live game by two of tho
strongest teams in the California League
were instrumental in bringing the
"cranks" to the well-kept grounds. Seat
ed in the sunny grand stand, the enthu
siasts yelled themselves hoarse when
"Tip" O'Neil, "Peek-a-Boo" Hardie and a
few other old-timers distinguished them
selves in the field or at the bat.
Errors were scarce on both sides, which
is to be wondered at, as both pitchers
were touched up so often that they
stopped trying to gain strikeouts, but put
the ball over the plate. The day was
ideal for playing the national game and
the players seemed to be Infused with
ginger. No ball was out of their reach
and brilliant catches and stops were made
by Sheehan, Dean, Weed and Shea.
It was thought the San Franeiscos had
In the first inning made a good beginning
by scoring four runs on as many hits,
but when the Oaklands took their innings
they went the local nine two runs better.
So it continued throughout the game. Not
an inning passed without some player
poking out a long hit and clearing the
bags.
It should not be to Wheeler's discredit
that eighteen hits were landed off his de
livery, as he pitched a steady game, gain
ing three striko-outs and giving his oppo
nents but two chances to walk. He had
the 111-luck to pitch against ;:n aggrega
tion of hard-hitters, which was his loss.
Shea's clever fielding makes him invalu
able to his team. Besides possessing a
good eye for difficult akyballs, he has a
strong wing, which he utilizes on all occa
sions to good advantage. Out of five hard
chances he took them all, ana had the
pleasure of retiring the "Prisons" by
catching three flies in one, two, three
order.
Manager McGlynn has found a good
manin"PaderewÃkl" we#d, who is strong
at bat and in the field. Sykes has the
making of a great player, and seems fit
ted for the initial position.

TO-DAY'S GAMES.
Attractions Offered by the Pa
cific States and Califor
nia Leagues.
The star attraction at Central Park to
day will be the appearance of James J.
Corbett, the pugilist-actor, who will play
flrst base for the Olympics, in their game
with San Jose. Yesterday's game showed
the visitors to be sluggers of the first
order and Knell will have to do his pret
tiest to keep them from making a target
of him. As Corbett has earned Quite a
reputation on the diamond, a large crowd
will likely be present to see him punch
not the bag, but the ball. The makeup is
as follows:
Olympics. Position. San Jose.
James J. Corbett. .First Base Hanlon

Sharkey Takes Umbrage at Jeffries'
Match With "Mexican Pete."
Bharkey pays he is not afraid of Jef
fries. He has paid so all along himself,
and now that the I.Â«os Angeles eiant has
made a match with "Mexican Pete,"
hitherto an unknown quantity, Manager
Tom McDonald steps to the fore and as
serts that the Vallejo slogger is willing
to fight Jeffries in a ring or in a room for
any old sum, all the way from $1 to $10,
000. McDonald also applies the euphemis
tic term of "cur" to Jeffries for some
reason of his own, and is hacked up by
the following, from Sharkey'n own fist:
PAN FRANCISCO. April 2. 1898.
Sporting Editor Callâ Dear Sir: I observe In
your columns to-day an announcement that
Jeffries has signed for a twenty-round glove
contest with one "Mexican Pete" before the
Olympic Club. Permit mi> to state through the
came medium that I consider that Jeffries
thereby forfeited all claim for square dealing,
as every overture had beÂ«'n made by me to In
duce him to sign with me 1 went so far as
to propose that we flip a coin for the choice
of club under whose auspices the match would
be handled.
Now I hold myself In readiness to meet the
boot men In the world In the business, and
hereby express a decided preference for Fitz
plinmons. Corbett, McCoy or Mnher. Note that
I am not looking for "dubs" or easy game, but
for top-notchers. The only condition I Impose
Is that an Eastern referee of unquestionable
reputation bÂ« selected. Yours truly.

Miss Frisco's Visit.
Yesterday afternoon Miss Frisco start
ed out on a voyage of discovery, deter
mined to find the most restful spot In the
city. Boarding a street car she met a
bevy of Easter brides. She asked the way
and they answered, "Come with us out
to the furnished cottage at Pattosien's,'
and she said: "I will. How happy she
was, and claimed a great discovery on
her part r a model cottage for an ideal
home out in the Mission. Nothing like
It in the city. So, taking off her hat and
seating herself in one of those soft arm
chairs in the parlor, she told the brides
that she would follow their example, let
some good chap propose to her, have her
home furnished by Pattosien and live
happy ever after.
Cottage open from 8 a. m. to 5:30 p. m.
Everybody invited. â¢

SHOT HIS
VICTIM IN
COLD BLOOD
Policeman Tracey's
Assailant Iden
tified.
Recognized as the Mur
derer of an Inoffen
sive Chinaman.
Swore He Would Kill Anybody
Who Attempted to Ar
rest Him.
ADMITTED HIS GUILT.
Tho Bloody Crime Was Committed
Two "Years Ago in St.
Louis Alley.
Bah Non, the murderous highbinder :
who shot Police Officer Tracey in the
I arm last Wednesday night while the lat
ter was arresting him for wounding a fel
low-countryman, was identified last night â 
j in the City Prison as the man who about 'â â 
j two years ago shot and killed an inoffen
i sive Chinaman at Jackson street and St.
j Louis alley.
Bah Non is a member of the See Yups,
I and, as his victim, who belongs to the
j Sam Yups, was walking along St. Louis j
alley the bloodthirsty highbinder drew his '
! revolver and fired. The bullet struck the
i unfortunate Chinese in a vital spot, and ;
; he died a short time afterward. Notwith- ;
' standing that the police did all in their ;
j power to arrest the murderer, he managed
to elude their vigilance.
Shortly after the killing he went to Sac
ramento, where he worked on a hop
ranch. He returned to this city a few
j weeks ago with the avowed determina-
I tlon, as ho expressed it, of wiping out the !
â  Sam Yup Society. To another Chinaman
Who made a statement to the police last 1
night Btih admitted to him that he had
killed several Sam Yup men and that he j
I defied the police to arrest him. He declared '
I that he would shoot any police officer who
j would attempt to apprehend him for his
numerous crimes. "When he shot his last
! victim in Sullivan alley Wednesday night
i Police Officer Tracey, assisted by the
other members of the Chinatown squad,
attempted to arrest him. As they ap- :
proaoQed the murderous highbinder he ,
turned a revolver on them and en- j
deavored to shoot. Tracey closed in on
him, and in the struggle that followed
the bravo officer was shot in the arm.
i Police Officers Burke and Galloway then
I seized the desperate Chinaman, and, af
ter a short struggle, disarmed him. He
was then taken to the City Prison and
charged with an assault to commit mur
der.
Since the shooting the prisoner has re
peatedly expressed his regret that he had |
not killed Tracey. In an adjoining cell is
Yung Yee, another desperate Chinese
criminal. He was with Bah at the time
of the shooting. The police are convinced
that the two prisoners are responsible for
several murders committed in China
town.

TENDENCY TO
CENTRALIZATION
Professor Brown Talks
on American Educa
tional History.
Urges the Importance of Sec
ondary Schools in the
System.
Superintendent Perham of Berkeley
Discusses Department Work in
Grammar Grades.
Professor Elmer E. Brown of the de
partment of pedagogy, in a lecture at the
State University yesterday morning, dis
cussed the attitude of American courts
toward the establishment of secondary
schools, and emphasized the necessity
and importance of the high school as a
part of a complete educational system.
He spoke in part as follows:
"American courts have shown in their
decisions a disposition to favor the estab
lishment of secondary educational in
stitutions by local authorities. We often
hear it asserted that it is un-American,
contrary to the genius of our people and
against the political principles of a demo
cratic government, to provide by public
taxation for schools above the grammar
grades. I fail to see any truth in this
assertion. In fact, when I read the his
tory of American education I am proud
of the fact that we have provision for a
complete educational system, a system
which offers opportunity to student! of
all kinds, poor as well as rich, to
achieve a complete education.
"The history of education in Virginia
shows a curious state uf things. Thomas
Jefferson and others aimed to establish
a system consisting of a university at
the top and a network of primary
schools at the bottomâ the two groups
being connected by a group of secondary
schools. The establishment of the I'ni
versity of Virginia fulfilled the first re
riuircment, the establishment of primary
schools in the "hundreds" fulfilled the
second. But the State was unwilling and
failed to create the connecting link, the
secondary school system.
"In arguing for the high school we
should not take the ground that it bene
fits the few who enter the high schools,
but that it makes a complete system of
education. Failure to provide for high
schools would have a very strong in
fluence for the bad on pupils in lower
schools whose ambition for an education
would be overcome by the lack of oppor
tunity for satisfying that ambition.
"In addition to the tendency to embody
in the statutes provisions for the estab
lishment of secondary school there is a
notable tendency in our educational prog
ress toward centralization. 1 do not re
gard this centralization as making for
imperialism against democracy."
Superintendent F. E. Perham of the
Berkeley public schools spoke on "De
partment work In the Grades Below
the High Schools." He said:
"In many cases the attempt to intro
duce the department system into the
grammar grades has proved a failure.
In this State the system is carried on in
only one grammar school in San Diego,
but it has not proved satisfactory. The
system has been experimented on to some
extent in San Francisco, and also in
Marysville."
Superintendent Perham gave at length
the history of the various attempts that
have been made to supplant grade work
in the grammar schools with department
work. "The experiment has been tried,"
he said, "under disadvantageous circum
stances. The greatest difficulty has been
caused by giving too many pupils to one
teacher. In one case a teacher had to
deal with 400 pupils. I'nder such circum
stances it is impossible to obtain good
results. Teachers should not have more
than 175 pupils to teach, or 200 at the very
outside.
"It is objected that the sj-stem causes
a loss of discipline and a 4oss of time.
To prevent the former it is necessary to
establish a close relation between teacher
and pupil, an- this is not easily attained.
By proper arrangement of the classrooms
the loss of time can be avoided.
"In Marysvine, however, the experiment
is reported to be a success. The great
advantage is that opportunity is offered
for continuous work by the same teacher
with the same pupils for several years.
With the increase in the number of uni
versity graduates who are teaching gram
mar grades there seems to be a tendency
toward the department system and to
ward specialization."

CopjTlffMeiJ. IS9S, by James Gordon Bennett
PARIS, April 2â All the crimes of the '
â week sink into insignificance beside a ;
crime which in atrocity recalls to mind ,
the historic cjuise celebre of Tropmann. j
In a small village in Normandy, a I
short distance from the fashionable \
Burnme rresort of Trouville, the fore
man .oi a .sugar factory named Le |
Blond has been murdered, together |
â with his mother his wife and three j
children. This six-fold crime was com
mitted b-y a .man named Caillard, aged
33, who formerly worked in the district. '
Having stolen two, guns, a carbine, and '.
three revolvers, he got into Le Blond's I
garden, armed, with an arsenal of wea- j
pons. ami firing through the glass door i
at Le Blond and his wife, who were j
reading a paper In the kitchen, he kill
ed botli Instantly. Two small boys, 7
and 9 years old, alarmed by the report,
came down stairs, and the wretch shot
both down.
Then he entered the house and calmly
sat down .to eat and drink. While he
was so engaged a little girl of 5 came
In. He cut. her throat and then ran- ,
sacked the house. When he reached the
last be<lroom he found Le Blond's
mother-in-law in bed ami he killed her
with a revolver ball in the head. Hay- j
ing collected everything of value he
could tind, he stored his booty in a
portmanteau and started for the rail
wax station, where he booked for a
neighboring town. He was arrested
the next morning, and when the wretch
had made a full confession and related
all the details with revolting cynicism
and had been, taken to the scene of the
murder, according to the French cus
tom, to be confronted with the bodies of ;
his victims, the fury of the crowd was
such tha-t the gendarmes had the great- |
est difficulty in preventing them from |
lynching him then and there. Caillard ;
did not even make any excuse for the
act beyond that of want. He suffers j
fiom phthisis and is out of work. His !
daughter, with whom he lived, has also
been arrested. Caillard is believed to
he the perpetrator of several undiscov
ered crimes. He has already been be
fore -the Assize Court on a charge of
murder, but. was discharged in the ab
sence of proof.
Side by side with the mourning in
high places : is announced the grand
aristocratic marriage of Count Jean de |
Castellane, younger son of Marquis de
Castellane, with the Princess de Furst
enberg, widow of Prince Charles de
Furstenbergond daughter of the Duke '
of Talleyrand, who has just died. The '
succession of the father has not yet
.been settled, but it is believed that I
â¢ 'unite Hele de Perigord, eldest son of j
Prince de Sagan; will, with the assent j
of the. German- Emperor, assume the i
title and succeed to the estate of the [
dukedom, of Sagan.
VerdJ, who was engaged in Paris to
conduct, the "Stabat Mater" at the :
sacred concerts in holy week, is still

DEATH HAS
NOT ENDED
THEIR FEUD
Why Two Women
Lay Claim to
Enos' Body.
Senator's Wife Had In
sulted Mrs. Snyder
Years Ago.
In Revenge the Latter Resolved
to Wreck a Happy
Home.
STRIFE OVER THE DEAD.
The Widow Is Given Possession of
thÂ« Remains, but the Quarrel
Goes On.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SONOMA, April 2.â The body of John
S. Enos has lain in its casket since last
Wednesday, and since that time two
women have been battling to see which
one should put him in his grave. One
is his widow; the other holds by his
will the sole right to bury him; and so
the tragedy that began years ago is
neartng an end.
By his will Enos directed that Ra
chael Snyder should take charge of his
body and should bury it in her own
vault and with her own dead, but his
widow has come forward to claim his
body and there is now pending in the
Sonoma courts a legal controversy over
the corpse.
Senator Enos died on Wednesday in
Mrs. Snyder's house. On Friday fu
neral services were held over him, but
the interment was stopped by an in
junction from the court at Santa Rosa.
To-day an order served upon Mrs. Sny
der compelled her to surrender the body
to the dead man's relatives, and to
morrow another funeral service will be
said and he will be placed in the city
\ault to await further legal action.
The dead man will then be in charge
cf the couit, and neither woman can
touch him until the grewsome tight has
been decided
Seventeen years have elapsed since
Enos met Mrs. Snyder, and the meet
ing was not the first step in what was
so tragic a relationship. That step
was taken before the woman knew him.
Mrs. SnyoTer was a Miss Sears, and in
the early days of Sonoma County the
Sears owned all that was worth hold
ing. They were rich at first, but they
became poor, and then Miss Sears mar
ried Major Snyder. Snyder was rich,
and although the Sears were on the
verge of bankruptcy at the time of the
marriage their condition bettered at
once and the marriage was said to have
been a most successful event.
The bride was but 17 and her mar
ried life ended before she was 20, but
in bis will the major threw some light
upon the marriage and more. light upon
what followe^. He left his entire
property to his widow, but she was to
have it only so long as she remained
unmarried. Should she marry she was
to lose it all.
She did not marry, and as the years
went by the people of Sonoma Valley
began to talk of the rich and fascinat
ing young widow. While this talk
was at its highest Enos and his family
came up the valley to spend a summer.
There was a meeting between the two
women and a parting, and people said
it was because Mrs. Enos had refused
to recognize Mrs. Snyder and Mrs.
Snyder had vowed revenge in conse
quence. The story is an old one, but
as it is told Mrs. Snyder vowed she
would break up the home that had cast
her out. She is a quiet woman, soft
spoken, but determined, and one who
looks as if she had an excellent mem-
ory.
It was nearly ten years after the epi
sode in which Mrs. Enos figured that
Enos himself, the man over whose body
the two women are now striving, was
known as Mrs. Snyder's closest friend
and adviser. Before long there was talk
of domestic trouble, and then there was
an open separation. The names of
Snyder and Enos were linked together
as close as gossips could bring them,
and Enos was known no more at his
wife's home.
The Km is home was at a place near
Sonoma called Grand View, and when
the separation between Enos and his
wife became public she deeded the
place to him. Within a short time he
had sold it for $30,000. That was six
years ago, and since that time the wife
and daughter lived apart from the hus
band and Mrs. Snyder. Some months
ago there was talk of a reconcUiation,
and Mrs. Enos was willing to receive
the husband again and, with the
friends who urged a reconciliation, was
Mrs. Snyder. But Enos refused to have
anything further to do with his family,
and in that mood he died.
He died in a back parlor of Mrs. Sny
der's home. When he had come in on
Wednesday morning the chimney in
that room was on fire, and in the ex
citement of quenching the sparks his
old enemy, heart disease, seized him,
and he died in Mrs. Snyder's arms.
When she heard of the death of her
husband, Mrs. Enos telegraphed to the
undertaker at Sonoma to take posses
sion of the body. .Possession was re
fused by Mrs. Snyder. Then Mrs. Enos
came up the valley and sent her daugh
ter, Mrs. Willis, and her daughter's
husband to demand the body. They
were met by Mrs. Snyder, who offered
to let them view the remains but not
to take them away.
On Friday, in Mrs. Snyder's house,
the first funeral services were held and
the Rev. Mr. Wylie of Napa preached
a most impressive sermon. Part of the
ceremony included a reading of the will
of the deceased, in which he directed
that Mrs. Snyder dispose of his mortal
remains.
There was to have been an interment
in Mrs. Snyder's family vault, but Mrs.
Enos had in the meantime invoked the
aid of the courts of Santa Rosa and
an injunction on the dead secured it
from Friday's burial. Then Mrs. Sny
der was served with an order of court
directing her to surrender the body to
Mrs. Enos and this she recognized,
making possible a second funeral cere
mony to take place at the undertaker's
to-morrow.
The undertaker has orders not to al
low Mrs. Snyder to enter the house of
sorrow. Once in the city vault the
dead will have passed out of the con
troversy except as a cause of strife.
Enos will be buried and who will have
the bones is a matter for dry law and
hours of legal argument.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALIi, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
LED BY BLIND
RAGE TO TAKE
HUMAN LIFE
Foreman of a Fresno County
Ranch Shoots to Death an
Aged Employe.
FRESNO, April 2.â W. L. Motley was killed this morning by
Charles Worthington at J. R. Hite's ranch, near Wheatvllle, thirty
miles southwest of Fresno. The murder occurred just at daybreak, and
was the result of a trivial quarrel. Motley was shot as he was follow
ing Worthington into the ranchhouse. The contents of both barrels of
a double-barreled shotgun entered the unarmed man's body. Motley
exclaimed, "My God, you have killed me," and fell forward, expiring
almost instantly.
Worthingt*n Is foreman of the Hite ranch, and Motley and his
son, Walter E. Motley, were working under him. Young Motley was
harnessing his team when Worthington came into the barn and began
complaining about the way the horses were cared for. Young Motley
said his work was being done properly and the foreman replied that
the team had not been curried on Friday.
The father was in another part of the barn and heard Worthlng
ton's last remark about the horses. He said Worthington was a liar,
as the horses had received proper treatment.
"Don't you call me a liar," said Worthington, and he started for
the old man.
The two met In the bunk room of the barn and a rough and tumble
fight ensued. The son ran to his father's assistance, and hit Worthing
ton over the head several times. Worthington retreated toward the
house. He was smarting from the blows he had received and ex
claimed:
"I will go to the house and get a gun and shoot you," applying a
vicious epithet to the elder man.
He procured a double-barreled shotgun. The elder Motley fol
lowed him. He was unarmed and perfectly defenseless. Worthington
was standing inside, waiting to slay his victim. As Motley stepped
over the threshold Worthington fired. The men were only a few feet
apart. Both loads of shot crashed into the body of Motley. He was
hit in the side and his arm riddled with shot. The old man fell and
expired almost instantly.
With the fury of a demon Worthington sprang forward and struck
the dying man over the head time and again with the butt of his shot
gun. The breech stock was broken off and then the murderer left
his victim. Motley's life bood gushed out and covered the floor with
the sickening evidence of the murder.
During the shooting young Motley ran into the barn to keep out
of range of Worthington's gun. The murderer, however, did not at
tack him.
Jacob Yates and Walter Motley were the only witnesses of the
shooting.
Worthington gave himself up this afternoon. He requested Dave
Francis to accompany him from Wheatville to Fresno. After arriving
here his bruises about the head and body were dressed. He was then
placed in the County Jail. He refuses to talk in regard to the murder.
Coroner Long will hold an inquest to-morrow on the remains of
the victim. He was accompanied to Wheatville by Deputy District At
torney G. C. Freeman, who will gather evidence for the prosecution.
They will return to Fresno to-morrow afternoon.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, April 2.â The sentiment In
(it -niany in official and unofficial Â«:ir-
Ctefl tarly to-day was that the Hispano-
American crisis has veered consider
ably during the course of the week
and is now decidedly more favorable
to the United States. This, it is assert
ed, is partly due to the moderation of
President McKinley and the conserva
tive manner in which the United States
Minister, General Woodford, has dealt
with the authorities at Madrid, and
partly to the bitterness engendered by
the alleged wanton attack of a band of
insurgents upon the German sugar re
fineries at Canamaba, in the province of
Santa Clara, and the murder of four
persons connected witn me refinery, on
March 18, which has taught Germany
that Spain is unable to protect even
the lives of foreigners in Cuba,
As previously announced, the German
Foreign Office is demanding immedi
ate and full redress for this outrage,
and a German warship will soon be
sent to Havana if satisfaction is not
forthcoming in short order. The Span
ish Embassador here, Senor Mendez de
Vigo, has had lengthy conferences with
Baron yon Bulow, the German Min
ister for Foreign Affairs, who con
vinced the Embassador tl.at Germany
intended to have complete satisfaction,
including indemnity for the property
destroyed and for the lives taken.
The Embassador was also informed
that unless the redress was forthcom
ing, Germany would ha/tfolf a>efc, secure
damages and punish the offender;?. As
an incentive to quick reparation, Baron
yon Bulow added that provisional or
ders had been cabled to the command
er of the German warship Geier to sail
in the direction of Cuba. The Spanish
Embassador promised that he would
exert himself to the utmost to comply
with the German demands.
The newspapers here are also chang
ing their line and now concede in the
main the Justice of the American de
mands, acknowledging that Washing
ton has acted with moderation which
many another government would not
have shown under similar circum
stances.
The Cologne Gazette, the Vossische
Zeltung, the Lokal Anzeiger and other
leading newspapers highly eulogize
President McKinley's statesmanship
and express confidence that whatever
he ultimately decides will be dictated
by some good reason.
The United States Embassador, An
drew D. White, in an interview said
that thus far, acting under instruc
tions from Washington, he had not for
mally inquired of the German Govern
ment what its attitude would be In the
event of war. He had nevertheless
! been repeatedly assured informally by
I Baron Bulow that Germany will in no
| case assume an unfriendly attitude to
ward the United States, nor join in any
possible combination of the powers
having that end in view. In regard to
Emperor William's personal views, Mr.
j White said his Majesty has been gross
ly misrepresented by the foreign press.
The Emperor has repeatedly given Mr.
White to understand that he felt most
favorably disposed toward the United
States and his sympathies are with the
United States in this crisis.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SCHULTZ MOUNTAIN, via Merced,
April 2.â The hunt for the Cross Creek
train-robbers has how developed into
a waiting game. For the last two days
pursuing deputies have visited nearly
all the isolated camps" within a radius
of thirty miles of this mountain, and
from the spot where the bandits were
last seen, and notified the miners and
sheepherders to be on the lookout for
the fleeing men. The robbers had,
â¢when they were last seen, very little
food, and the Sheriffs are obliged to
wait until hunger forces them from
their hiding-place. The mountains in
this neighborhood are honey-combed
with caves and abandoned mining
shafts, and they afford safe places of
concealment for the hunted men.
One Sheriff's posse, headed by S. W.
Dickinson and G. W. Yoakum is now
centered near Grub Gulch, about twen
ty miles south of here, in the hope of
heading the robbers off should they be
trying to reach the Fresno Flats and
Samson Flats, the country where Ev
ans and Sontag so long defied the offi
cers. Cliff Regan has many friends in
Fresno Flats, and a woman who has
been known as Regan's wife resides
there. â  â  . , : ,
Deputy Sheriff Mack and John Dv-
Kan, at the head of another posse, are
searching the hills in this vicinity and
waiting to hear of the robbers applying
at any of the cabins for food. They are
making their headquarters in this
vicinity.
Two men who are supposed to have
been the bandits camped about a half
mile from the Francis mine in Cathay
Valley on Tuesday night The foot
prints about the campfire correspond
with those at the scene of the train
robbery, and also with those found
about the abandoned horse and buggy
and the camps in Indian Gulch which
the robbers are known to have visited.
It is pretty definitely settled that the
bandits are heading for the Fresno
flats, and the country between where
the robbers are supposed to be and
their goal is filled with armed men
eager to meet them and give battle.
The officers do not expect to get them
without a fight, and every man hunting
them carries his weapons on a hair
trigger and ready to shoot at the least
sign of danger. Deputy Sheriff Mack
to-day, with one or two of his men,
started for the vicinity of the Three
Buttes, a few miles north of here, to
warn the ranchers and sheepherders of
that vicinity to keep a close watch for
Regan and his mysterious partner in
crime, and also to arrange some method
of communicating with the posse now
in Grub Gulch, so that the two posses
can close in on the punwed men shouid
further news of them be received.

The line of guests occupied two hours
In passing through the parlors of ths
Arlington Hotel. Secretary Long, de

stopped a few moments.
The President's arrival was the sig

refused to take advantage of the gen

preferring to remain in line and meet
the Maine's commander when his time
came. As he reached him, the Presi

mark, "Captain, it gives me great
pleasure to have the honor of meeting
you," and with a few brief words cf

Nearly all the laborers from the ban

Europe.
News reached Port Limon on March
20 of a skirmish between a body of
Costa Rica's advance troops and Nica
raguan pickets near the town of La
Cruz, near the frontier line. The Costa
Ricans advanced to almost hailing dis
tance, when the Nicaraguans, fearing
an attack, opened fire, wounding the
commander of the force in the locality,
General Avila, and killing one private.
The Costa Ricans returned the fire with
more disastrous results, as seven Nica
raguans were killed and several wound
ed. Both sides then retreated to their
respective posts.
General Avila has been reprimanded
for imprudently going too near the
border. . â¢

MR. LYNCH'S
CLERKS IRE
A-TREMBLE
He Will Make Several
Changes Very
Soon.
Civil Service System at
the End of Its
Rope.
Patriots to Be Rewarded for
Their Fidelity and Sac
rifices.
GROVER'S MOVE BALKED.
Judge Kirkpatrick's Decision Will Be
the Text and Authority of the Col
lector for His Action.
It is expected that within a few days
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch will
make sweeping changes in the person
nel of his office, following out his belief
that the civil service system does not
I cover a multitude of clerks in the Inter
nal Revenue Department. He bases his
belief on a recent decision by Judge
Andrew Kirkpatrlck of the United
States District Court at Trenton, N. J.
Judge Klrkpatrick holds that deputy
collectors of internal revenue are
United States officers, and that the
i power of their removal rests with the
appointing power. He therefore directs
: the deputies to vacate their ofjHces.
The decision (which was rendered a
few weeks ago â has caused more con
sternation in the Collector's office than
did the earthquake of last Wednesday
night. The clerks do their work with
1 bated breath and In fear and trembling,
i for not one of them knows when his or
; her head will fall into the wastebasket.
Ever since Mr. Lynch's appointment
! as Collector the question of his right
to appoint all his subordinates has boen
i studied and discussed. A large and
; active element of the Republican party
of this city and State is said to be op
' posed to the civil service system, and
many leading Republican organissa
i tions, notably the Continental League,
! have formulated and adopted stirring
! resolutions in regard to the matter. Mr.
Lynch himself does not believe in the
civil service system, at least in so far
as It applies to his office, and he has
held many consultations on that 3ub-
J Ject with Cashier Hamilton of the Cus
tom House and other Republicans, both
attached and unattached.
it has been represented, and vory
! forcibly, that there are a large number
j of active Republicans in this city and
j throughout the State whose services to
i the party have been of great valu-e and
almost indispensable. When the heads
of the Federal departments \vÂ«re ap
j pointed last year under the McKinley
administration search was made for
places into which to install the more
active and worthy of these workers,
but it seemed that the civil service pad
lock was on every desk. "No Admit
i tance! Beware of the Civil Service
Bulldog," seemed to be displayed at the
! entrance to every department. Cleve
land Democrats, some of whom had
fought, against the Union, were holding
: down fat berths where short hours and
I long pay appeared to be the rule.
The Postomce was the most strongly
: fortified, and beyond the appointment'
of Benjamin McKinley, uncle of the
President, to the position of Assistant
Postmaster in place of R. E. Doyle,
since deceased, and the transfer of John
L. Meares, superintendent of city de
livery, to the registry department ami
the Hlling of the vacated place by A.
M. Cox, no changes were or could be
made.
In the custom house department con
ditions were found not so rigid, and
Collector Jackson (with the assistance
of Chief Clerk Jerome) got rid alto
gether of Second Deputy Tobin and ap
pointed his Bon, Stanley Jackson, to the
place. Clerk Beauce was also removed
and his place taken by a friend of the
Collector. An almost clean sweep was
made of the Cleveland laborers in the
appraiser's department and their places
were filled with good Republicans of
the MrKinlcy brand. In addition there
was created the position of plumber at
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
$5 per day for every day In the year
except Sundays. State Senator Kelly
got it.
It was found to- be very difficult to
break Into the Internal revenue depart
ment, but since Collector Lynch's ap
pointment the fates have become more
kind. Under the Welburn administra
tion the civil service rules provided that
there should be exempted from their
operation the following employes in the
Internal revenue department:
One employe in each Internal Revenue
District, who shall act n.s cashier.
A Chief Deputy or Assistant Collector,
a,s may be determined by tho Treasury
Department.
Beyond these appointments the hands
of the Collector were tied. But, prob
ably owing to the pressure, the Civil
Service Commission amended this rule
on July 27, 181)7, so as to designate the
exempted as follows:
One cashier.
One Chief Deputy Collector In each dis
trict where the number of deputies ex
ceed four.
One deputy in each branch office.
Collector Lynch said yesterday that
he believed that Judge Kirkpatrick's
decision has settled the question of civil
service in tho internal revenue depart
ment. In Kentucky tho Collectors are
dismissing all the old Cleveland depu
ties and are filling their places with
McKinley patriots.
It was th<.-ught that Judge Kirkpat
rick's decision would not be rendered
for some time, because there Is pend
ing in the United States Supreme Court
an appeal from the decision of United
States District Judge Jackson of West
Virginia, he deciding that the Demo
cratic Collectors now in office could not
be removed except for cause. Judge
Kirkpatrick's is the third decision
given. That in West Virginia sustained
the Democratic incumbent, and a de
cision in Indiana sustained the newly
appointed Republican deputies.
- Collector Lynch has Judge Kirkpat
rick's opinion in full, and has learned
it almost by heart. He has not yet
declared war, but the deputies and
clerks are already trembling In their
boots and French-heeled shoes, for sev
eral members of the fair sex wield pens
under his supervision.

BELIEVED OF HIS COIN.
George Erickson, a Stranger, Robbed
in a Saloon on Kearny Street.
George Erickson, a laborer, employed
on the San Joaqtiln Valley Railroad, came
to the city Friday to have a good time.
He had about $80 in his pocket when he
Rtarted out that night to see the sights
on the Barhary Coast.
Shortly before 1 o'clock yesterday morn
ing he was in the Yosemite saloon, 817
Kearny street, and feeling good ho want
ed to shake dice with any one for the
drinks. He incautiously displayed his
wealth, and J. Lewis, a frequenter of
the saloon, promptly held him up and re
lieved him of his wealth, which consisted
of $7." in gold and about $3 In silver.
Erickson went to the California street
police station and reported the robbery.
Sergeant Christiansen and Policeman
Frank McGrayan returned with him to
the saloon, and he pointed out Lewis as
the man who had taken his money.
Lewis was arrested and a charge of
grand larceny was booked against him.

WITNESS IS
INTIMIDATED
Thomas Dudy Causes a
Sensation in Judge Con
lan's Court
.
Received a Threatening Letter
as to the Evidence He
Should Give.
Ho Was an Eye- Witness to the Con
ductof the Officers When Lieuten
ant Burke Was Shot.
The preliminary examination of
Theodore P. Haynes on the charge of
murdering Lieutenant Bur".:e on March
23 was continued for an hour before
Judge Conlan yesterday.
The only witness examined was
Thomas Dudy, who lives at 315 Mont
calm street. He was with Robert Cole,
the witness examined on Friday, and
his testimony was practically the same
as Cole's. He graphically described
th*e incidents that led up to the shoot
ing of the lieutenant, and said that
Haynes fired either two or three shots
at the dying officer while he was lying
on the ground. As the shots were fired
at Burke and Burke returned the fire
he saw the four officers who "were with
the lieutenant running, as he expressed
it, "each way."
He saw the patrol -wagon driver run
up to the wounded officer after some
minutes and drag his body away. Po
liceman Marlowe was flriner at Haynes'
cabin at this time from Callan's point,
and then he saw him run toward where
Policeman Merchant was standing and
give a boy 50 aents to go and get him
more cartridges. After the lieutenant
fell Merchant ran around to the bank
north of the cabin, where witness and
Cole were, and started firing at
Haynes' cabin from that point. Wil
kinson ran down Montcalm street from
Rooney's cabin to where his horse was
and witness did not see him again.
Merchant had been in Hopkinson's
yard, and after the lieutenant was
shot he ran nut of the yard to where
witness and Cole were. Kennedy was
near Hopkinson's yard, but witness
could not say what he did after the
shooting. He confessed that he did
not see much of him. He saw Ken
nedy with a shotgun.
A sensation was caused in court
when Attorney Sweeney, while cross
examining the witness, asked him if
he had received a letter from any one
as to what testimony he should give.
Dudy fenced the question, but being
pressed reluctantly admitted that he
had received such a letter. He was
asked as to its contents and said that
it told him to have nothing to say
about the case and to refer any in
quirers to Chief Lees' office. He was
asked to produce the letter, but as he
did not bring it with him he was or
dered to produce it this morning at 11
o'clock, till which time the case ad
journed.
The letter, it !s understood, warned
Dudy to be very careful not to say
anything in court about the conduct
of the four policemen at tho time Lieu
tenant Burke was shot, otherwise his
property would be taken from him and
he would be driven out of the place.
At the time of the fatal affray Dudy
was very outspoken as to the conduct
of the officers, and said they all ran
away and showed every sign of abject
fear, and that is why he received the
threatening letter.
BETTER TRANSFER FACILITIES.
Residents of the Western Addition
Make a Protest to Mana
ger Vining.
Western Addition residents have a
mild protest about ready for presentation
to Manager Vinlng, of tho Market street
railway system, on the lack of sufficient
transfer accommodations on the cars run
ning out to Mission and the San Bruno
road district.
It is only a few months since that tho
Point Lobos Improvement Association
wrung from the Market street system an
exchange of transfers between the Geary
and FiUmore street lines, and, this was
only conditional, Mr. Vinlng conceding
the privilege on an experimental issue
only, alleging at the time of the con
cession that If it paid it would be con
tinued, and further that the company had
under consideration the extension of
transfers from Geary to the Kearny
street line.
Now this Is just what the Western Ad
djtion people want at this time; they
say that tho Flllmore street transfer ex
periment has been a decided success, and
similar transfers are asked for on the
Devlsadero street line.
Another cause of complaint comes from
people in the Western Addition regard
ing the transfer system to the Howard
street, and other Mission cars, from the
FiUmore street line. As it is now, a
person residing in the Western Addition
who may wish to visit the City and Coun
ty Hospital or take a ride out on the San
Bruno road has to pay two fares.
At the last meeting of the Point Lobos
Improvement Club a committee was ap
pointed for the purpose of waiting on
Manager Vlning with a view to getting
those concessions on the transfer system
from him, particularly the Kearny street
exchange.
NO ROTTEN HULKS.
Ships In the Alaska Trade Must Be
Safe and Sound.
The State Board of Trade will start out
to-morrow and round up the town in the ,
interests of the trade fur Alaska. When !
the board took up the work where the j
old Alaska Trade Committee dropped it j
an effort was made to find how much ;
support could -c relied upon from the
merchants and the principal commercial
bodies of this city. To this end, delegates
from these organizations assembled and
gave expression to the belief that the ;
people of San Francisco should help in j
every way to advertise to the world that :
this is the best outfitting port for those
Who are going to Alaska of any on the j
Pacific Coast; also that they would i
recommend to their respective bodies that '
overy help be extended to the Board of
Trade in this work. Manager J. A. Filcher
has decided that now is the time for the
board to learn to what extent these in- <
dorsements go, so to-morrow he will send
out half a dozen energetic canvassers to
solicit subscriptions for money to carry
on the work mentioned.
Word has been received at the bureau ;
that tho trade of Seattle and Tacoma Is
falling off to such an extent that many of j
the vessels leaving the northern ports j
have gone out with light passenger and j
freight lists. Several of the ships booked |
for tho far north have postponed their
voyages indefinitely on this account. The
contrary Is the condition of affairs here.
From what can be learned, every steamer
and sailing ship on the Board of Trade's
list has all the freiÃ.-t it can carry, and
nearly all of tho berths have been spoken
for: One reason for the preference of
these vessels Is that Manager Filcher will
not allow the name of any steamer or
sailing ship to bo placed on the black
board unless the same has been rated as
good by the Lloyds or has passed inspec
tion by the underwriters. The late disaster
attending the sailing of the Almy was a
warning that was not passed unheeded,
and the board will not Indorse any vessel
unless it is known to bo sound and safe.
RUINING THEIR EMPLOYES.
The Merchants' Association Begins
a Fight Against the Poolrooms.
One of the strongest organizations in
the city, the Merchants' Association, has
begun a fight against the poolrooom evil
that has caused so much comment from
press and pulpit. At a meeting held yes
terday the following resolution was
passed:
"Resolved, That the efforts of the Mar
chants' Association be directed toward tho
closing of the poolrooms in San Fran
cisco and that the superintendent of this
association, L. M. King, is hereby di
rected to prepare a list of all poolrooms
now in existence in this city."
So far no positive plan has been de
cided upon, and, in fact, the crusade will
be carried on according to later develop
ments. The importance of the movement
had boon made manifest to many of the
association by tho knowledge of some of
their trusted employes going wrong
through the evil influence of the pool
rooms.
Harry Winters' Appeal.
The attorneys for Harry Winters, con
victed of having murdered C. A. Andrews,
made application yesterday to the Su
preme Court for a writ of mandate to
compel Superior Judge G. A. Buck of San
Matoo County to certify to a bill of excep
tions and settle tho same. After Winters'
conviction a motion for a new trial was
made and denied. The judgment of the
court was death by hanging. When the
bill of exceptions was 11 led the Judge, so
the petition alleges, arbitrarily decided
that the appeal bad no merit and he re
fuped to settle the bill. The attorneys
asserted tho. Judge <if the lower court had
no right to pass upon the merits of the
appeal, which matter should come only
before the highest tribunal. The Su
preme Justices will consider the appli
cation to-morrow.

TRAVERSER THE
DERBY WINNER
"Pa" Bradiey's Crack Colt
"Was in Front From
Start to Finish.
Tod Sloan on Linstock, the
Opening Choice, Was
Unplaced.
The Winner Superbly RiddÂ«n by
Lonnie Clayton â Favorites in
Winning Form.
Derby day attracted a large crowd
to Ingleside track, but not a great one.
In point of numbers it would not com
pare favorably with the vast concourse
of people which saw Scarborough take
this classic event one year ago, and
cheered lustily as Frank Coady landed
the despised outsider first. There was
no sweltering, hustling, bustling Jam
of speculators in the betting ring, and
the layers of odds were never in im
mediate danger of being swept off the
block from a flood of coin. But the
contest for the rich $5000 prize was a
good one nevertheless, and will live for
time to come in California turf history,
not only on account of the victory
achieved by "Pa" Bradiey's chestnut
simoon Traverser, but also the grand
showing made by the maiden, Borgia,
which ran a close second and under
more favorable circumstances might
have been returned the winner.
The big event of the day was fourth
on the programme, and a large crowd
eagerly watched the candidates in their
warming-up gallops. Of the original
list of entries, seven were carded to
start. Linstock, the mount of James
Tod Sloan, struck the fancy of the
crowd by the way he warmed up, and
in the opening betting was chalked up
favorite at odds of 9 to 5. Burns &
Waterhouse started three â Recreation,
Napamax and Traverser, and they
commanded second call with two 9
quoted against the trio bracketed. At
post time the stable had been so heav
ily played that 9 to 5 was the best ob
tainable, while Linstock receded to 11
to 6. Mat Storn liked the chances of
his charge, Morellito, with Joe Piggott
in the saddle, and he was in demand
at threes. Borgia was heavily touted,
and the books never laid better than
10 to 1 about him. Torsida had but
few friends.
Very little time was consumed at the
start, all getting away well with the
exception of Napamax, which became
entangled with the barrier and was
eased up. As predicted, Lonnie Clay
ton, who had the leg up on Traverser,
led the bunch past the stand, with
Linstock and the others close up. A
mile was covered and still "Pa" Brad
ley's chestnut showed no signs of back
ing up, and the riders on those behind
him were growing anxious. Before the
stretch was reached. Recreation bump
ed Linstock and his goose was cooked.
In the run home, Conley went desper
ately at work on Borgia, and though
the maiden showed to be made of the
right sort of stuff, his ride was a trifle
ill-timed, and Traverser, all out, car
ried off the long end of the stake by a
length, reeling off the mile and a quar
ter in 2:08^. Thorpe, on Recreation,
was third, five lengths away. Morellito
disappointed her admirers, apparently
being ont of it before half the distance
had been traveled. Lonnie Clayton, on
the winner, rode an admirable race, and
received about as stirring an ovation

as it is possible to stir up on a Cali
fornia race track, where the gambling
spirit alone prevails.
The other six events passed off with
out especial incident or accident. First
choices took four purses.
Billy Randalls Tammany colt. Green
back 11, was played down to 6 to 5 fa
voritism to win the opening six-fur
long selling run, but had no speed
whatever. Queen Blazes led to the
stretch, where Clayton, on the 7 to 1
chance, St. Philip, took the lead and
won ridden out from Octuruck.
The fast but faint-hearted R. Q. Ban
was sent out a slight favorite over Po
tentate and Abina in the six-furlong
sprint that followed, and ran third.
Abina. with Clawson up, raced Poten
tate to a standstill, and in a drive led
Daily Racing Form out less than a
length in 1:15 flat.
Our Climate was considered a cer
tainty for the mile hurdle event, and
coupled with his stable-mate. Fore
most, the pair went to the post 3 to 5
choices in the ring. It was a two-horse
race from the start. Pin^s on Vera^ua
took hold of Our Climate from the start,
and after a long hard drive got the
verdict by over a length in 1:49^, a
new track record.
The mile handicap was a gift for the
Corrigan entry, Joe T'llman, the favor
ite, ridden by Sloan. The chestnut
horse overhauled Libertine in the
stretch, downing Galen Brown's old
sprinter under restraint in 1:41 flat.
Myth finished in the show.
Tom Ryan had the fast brown filly.
Good Friend, entered In the sixth event
at six furlongs, and was made the me
dium of a heavy plunge, her odds be
ing forced down from 4 to 2. After
Valencienne had chased out in front
at a terrific clip, Clawson on Ryan's
filly made his move and overtaking Mo-
Light and Valencienne, defeated th*
former half a length in the fast time
of 1:13%.
Y\*illie Sink's colt, Formero, added
one more to his long string of victories
in the last event. The youngster was
a 1 to 2 choice over the field of two
year-olds, and at the wire led Santello
out over a length, covering the four
furlongs in 48%. Sevens was a close
third.
Track Notes.
Greenback, favorite for the opening
race, bled, which accounted for his poor
showing.
"Welch, who rode Foremost, was un
der the influence of liquor, and the
judges ruled him off for an exhibition
of foul and reckless riding.
Anna Held, the actress, arrived in
her special car at the track just as the
field in the Derby was going to the post.
Carrier pigeons are again being
brought into requisition at Ingleside to
convey the results of races run to the
poolrooms.
Tod Sloan, who rode Linstock,
claimed a foul against Thorpe, but no
action was taken by the judges.
Had Traverser been started as a sep
arate entry the ring would have laid
15 to 1 about him. As it was, he was 5
to 1 for the place and 2^ to 1 to run
third.
In the sixth event Good Friend
equaled the track record for six fur
longs of 1:13%, made by Crescendo.
Fortunate pulled up very lame out
of his race.
Sevens was badly Interfered with
near the paddock, or the filly would
have been closer up.
MME. LOUISE HELD.
Woman Who Threw Acid at Her
Landlord Must Stand Trial.
SAN JOrfE. April 2.â Mme. Louise, who
threw muriatic acid at the face of E. F.
Robinson, her landlord, was to-day held
for trial in the Superior Court by Justice
Kirkpatrlck. Her bail was fixed at $3000.
Mme. Louise said her right name was
Mrs. S. E. Master. She said she thought
the glass contained water in place of the
acid, and that when Robertson spoke to
her roughly she threw the liquid at him.
Passing of a Pioneer.
PETALI'MA, April 2.â At his daugh

ARE IN FEAR OF
WESTERN FRUIT
Competition Is Worrying tho
Germans Far More
Than Pests-
Reasons Why Some of California*
Exports Are Discriminated
Against.
A letter was received Tuesday &3T Man
ager Filcher of the State Hoard of Trade
from Hamburg, Germany, under date o
March 11. and writt. n by .Mr. Kdwnrd
Summer, a gentleman who was in Mr.
Filcher's employ at the time ho had Cali
fornia's exhibit in Hamburg last summer,
which contains some points <>f general in
ter.st to California. The letter says:
'â¢The German fruit-growers are fighting
hard" to keep the California fruit out. I
think this is due a good deal to the re
sult of your exhibit h^re last summer.
They have Â»een that California has the
nerve to go ahead in the typical Ameri
can way. This is what they fear more
than the fruit lice. Schutze. an importer
of California fruits, has heard that your
State is talking of making another exhibit
in Europe, and he is strongly opposed to
it. He says you encourage too many peo
ple to ship, and thus spoil the market.
He says when irresponsible people ship
the fruit is sold for anything and the
growers do not get the money tln-y
should. Jealousy. 1 think, is the cause of
Mr. Schutze's protest."
The gentleman goes' on to say that he Is
dealing in California fruits and wine ia
small quantities, which he has to buy
from the importers because his means are
not sufficient to enable him to import
himself. But he says:
"In spite of hard work and small profits
I am satisfied. Nearly all the hotels,
boarding-houses, the Hamburg hospitals
and private people are buying from me.
I show them how to prepare the fruit ac
cording to the methods taught by you at
the Hamburg Exposition, and when pre
pared this way they like it and buy it
again; but the price I have to pay her*
for California fruit and wine is too high
and leaves me very little profit. I am
glad to know your State is raising money
for more exhibit work in Europe or
Berlin. Do you not think that a steady
exhibition room in Hamburg would be
much cheaper and give better benefits to
California growers and dealers? It could
be supported a long time for $10,000.
"If lean get money enough I am coming
to California to learn all about its prod
ucts and business ways, to have tha
benefit of it in the business of dealing in
your products, in which I am here trying
to build myself up. I am promised some
backing, which another season I hope will
enable me to import by the carload."
Mr. Filcher has another letter from
Germany from a big importing firm there,
asking to be enlightened in ro-gard to
the true character of the San Jose scale
and the extent of its ravages in Califor
nia. He learns from Alex Craw, the State
Quarantine Officer and Entomologist for
the Slate Board of Horticulture, that
while this scale load its origin in San Jose,
it is now practically extinct there, and is
less of a pest in California than in many
of the other Statesâ that, as a matter of
fact, there is no danger from it whatever
to be apprehended from the dried fruit
trade. Mr. Craw has promised to write a
full statement regarding the situation that
exists here in relation to this scale, and
the origin and character of the pest, for
the benefit of Mr. Filcher's German cor
respondent, and the latter hopes to have
said information published in Germany as
a means of allaying to some extent the
apprehension there regarding the impor
tations of California fruit?.

and last November left here and went to
T.a Grange, Stanislaus County, where he

time Bfnce he was arrested and brought I
back here on a charge of having stolen !
an ammeter of the value of $50 while
working for the company. When the case !
came to trial before a jury the prosecu- !
tlon made so poor a showing that the j
jury waa instructed to acquit on motion j

THE SA^T FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
CHURCHILL MAY
BE COMING WEST
The Ex-Consul Very Well
Known to People
in Oakland.
Received His First Start on the
Road That Led to
Success.
An Act of Ingratitude That Has Not
Yet Passed From the
Memory.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 2.
Much interest is expressed here regard
inp ex-Consul Churchill's disappearance
from his home in Brooklyn and his wife's
fear that he has committed suicide.
Mrs. Churchill was an Oakland girl, and
it was in a local newspaper office that
Churchill was given his first start in this
country.
About twelve years ago Churchill drift
ed into Oakland. He was an Englishman
and had traveled considerably among the
South Sea Islands. On his arrival here
he was "broke," but, making the ac
quaintance of some newspapermen, he
was given a chance to work on the Trib
une. He had brains, and some of his new
friends helped him out with clothes and
credit till he got squarely on his feet.
He did not show much gratitude to his
benefactors, for he broke up a home and
ran off with the woman who is now his
wife. After this Churchill wrote a book
entitled "A Princess of the South- Seas,"
which had a good reception and gained
for its author considerable notoriety.
Churchill worked on newspapers in the
East, and for a time he was city editor
on a paper in Brooklyn.
It was while thus employed that he se
cured the appointment of Consul to
Samoa. He stayed with his wife in Oak
land on his way to the islands, and both
went down together. Sonic surprise was
expressed when Mrs. Churchill came back
on the first steamer and remained Â«Kh
friends here till she secured an appoint
ment with the Damrasch Opera Cora-
Some months later, a Mrs. Holmes of
San Francisco created some sensation by
making a claim to be the contract wife
of Churchill. She produced what pur
ported to be the necessary documentary
evidence to support her claim and for
warded it all to Senator Perkins, who as
sured Mrs. Holmes that he -xould lay the
matter before the proper department of
the government. Mrs. Holmes demanded
that Churchill be dismissed from his
consular appointment, and some months
later he left Samoa, though it is not
known how much Mrs. Holmes' repre
sentations had to do with his leaving.
Churchill returned to Brooklyn and was
lost sight of to his friends here until the
news was received that he had left home
and his wife feared he had ended his life.
His acquaintances do not share the be
lief that he has committed suicide, and
would not be surprised if he should turn
up on this coast.

around to lend aid and take up a sub
scription for the unfortunate young
woman.
At last the young lady has overplayed
her hand and word has been sent out
from San Bernardino that her case has
been investigated and that she is a
fraud. Her escapades began in this
city about two years ago, and since
then she has "worked" successfully
nearly every city on the coast and In
the ooast States. In Oakland she was
arrested as she was trying to get in
front of a moving train. She was found
in possession of a piece, of rope and
said that she intended to hane herself
at the first opportunity. She was roy
ally treated by Sheriff. White and sent
cm her way rejoicing.
The woman is now on her way north,
having been put on the train at River
side and ordered to leave. She tried to
drown herself at that place, but Sheriff
Johnson suspected her game and or
dered her out of town.
The next day the woman, according
to advices sent to this city, appeared
at San Bernardino, and was suddenly
overcome by fits in the center of the
city. She \'as so violent that it took
several men to hold her down. Sh>? was
taken to the hospital and w<>i; treated,
and several people worked over har for
hours to save her life. She recovered,
and was sent on her way rejoicing.
The next day she was at Redlands,
and was so sick that she was given
good quarters in a hotel. Next day she
was recognized and sent out of town.
It is believed that she will not be long
arriving in this county, and as soon as
she does arrest will follow. The young
woman is rather attractive, and has a
pleasant manner, but it is considered
strange that she should work the same
places twice, with only a change of
names. The woman is not insane, and
is possessed of a strong constitution,
and it is believed that she has ac
cumulated some wealth by her trickery.

Secretary of the Treasury Gage
Names Seattle as Head
quarters.
Detectives Will Be Sent to Alaska
to Investigate Reported.
Counterfeiting.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, April 2.â George W. Hazen
is now In the city establishing head
quarters for a new secret service district.
Secretary of the Treasury Gage has in
cluded Washington, Oregon, Idaho and
Montana as a division and placed Mr.
Hazen in charge. His staff will consist
of five or six men. From his office detec
tives will be sent to Alaska to investigate
reported counterfeiting. If the occasion
demands, Alaska being virtually a part of
the new district. The new division will
be termed the Seattle district.
Heretofore all counterfeiting investiga
tions necessary in this State have been
made by detectives or special secret
service men sent from San Francisco,
and all complaints regarding the circula
tion of counterfeits were of necessity re
ferred to the headquarters in that city.
The largely increased volume of money
in circulation on Puget Sound since the
Alaska rush began rendered it almost im
possible for the San Francisco headquar
ters to attend speedily to all of the cases
reported from this section as requiring
investigation, and for this reason Secre
tary Gage made the subdivision indicated
and located the new district manager at
Seattle.
Manager Hazen has been in the secret
service for about six years and for about
five years past he has held the responsible
position or chief of the District of New
York, by far the most important in the
United States.

TO GUIDE YOUNG REPUBLICANS.
OAKLAND, April 2.â Arthur H. Breed, who was elected last night to pre
side over the Young Men's Republican League for the next year, has a re
sponsible task. There is no doubt that the organization will control over 2000
votes, and since its birth it has been a factor in shaping the fate of candi
dates. The league is the strongest political organization in the county, and
did good work in the McKinley campaign. All kinds of influence is being
brought to bear to use the league in the interest of certain candidates, but
President Breed declares that so long as he is in the chair it shall be used
for helping the success of the Republican party and for no less a purpose.
DISABLED SHIP
PASSED AT SEA
Startling News Reported
by the Captain of the
Conway.
Probable Loss of a Large Ves
sel With Her Entire
Crew.
Could Not Give Assistance Because
of the Storm That Was
Raging.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April 2.â A British ship
sailing toward the Pacific Coast was
seen dismantled and in distress six weeks
ago by the British ship Conway, Cap
tain Hume, which arrived ten days
ago from Manilla to load wheat. Cap
tain Hume notified the Lloyds on his
arrival, but did not make the story
public until to-day, on the eve of his
departure for Europe.
He says that on February 15, during
a storm, his sailors sighted a large
dismantled iron ship of 1500 to 2000 tons
in about longitude 152 west and lati
tude 37 north. At the time a terrific
gale raged, making the sea very high,
and darkness was approaching. The
gale blew the disabled vessel to the
windward of the Conway, and Captain
Hume was unable to reach her before
nightfall. When discovered the
strange vessel was about five miles dis
tant. Originally she was a three
masted iron ship. The storm had car
ried away the rigging, until only the
fore lower mast remained standing.
Captain Hume, by means of a power
ful glass, made out that she had a
white painted port and a large, half
round aft. The Conway had no sooner
hove into sight than the disabled ship
hoisted her flag and attempted to sig
nal. Captain Hume took the glass into
his own hands and watched eagerly to
see what message would come from
the desolate hulk in the distance. The
signaling proved unsuccessful, for be
fore he could make out what kind of
flag was raised it had been torn into
fragments by the wind. That there
were people on board was evidenced
by the raising of the flag, but what
condition they were in or who they
were are mysteries that only the wind
and wave can reveal.
During the night the ship was lost to
view, and she was not sighted again.
Seafaring men who heard Captain
Hume's story this morning believe that
she has sunk ere this. Without masts
and sails she was running aimlessly
over the ocean, with the probabilities
in favor of ultimate disaster unless re
lieved by some vessel during a cessa
tion of the windstorm that has raged
on the Pacific for weeks. Captain
Hume's course in not standing by is
considered proper, because his own
ship was imperiled by the storm, and
the boats could not have lived in the
rough seas then prevailing. Captain
Hume believes the vessel to have been
a grain ship crossing to the United
States seeking a charter. Last night
he received a cablegram from the
Lloyds of London asking him to cablÂ«
the details to London.
No vessel of the description given,
bound for North Pacific Coast points,
is known to be missing.
PRINCIPAL CONDIT
FORMALLY ACCUSED.
Charge That He Assisted Pupils
During Examinations Will Be
Investigated.
STOCKTON, April 2.â The' case of Pro
fessor Condit, principal of the Home
stead School, charged with trying to raise
his pupils' percentage in an examination
by piving beforehand the questions to be
asked, was formally brought to the atten
tion of the Board of Education to-day,
when the father of one of the pupils filed
a communication as folows:
"I herein charge Principal Condit of the
Grant School with having coached his
pupils previous to the examination on
the questions in the testa which were
submitted by the County Board as the
official test for November 17, 1597. I re
spectfully ask your honorable body to in
vestigate the charges."
The object of filing the communication
was to get the charge officially before the
board, which will now be obliged to con
sider it. If the charge is sustained Prin
cipal Condit will probably be found guilty
of unprofessional conduct and his certi
ficate to teach will be revoked.
MRS. TERRY NOW

NEW YORK, April 2.â The Paris cor

ALBERT HOFF
IS GUILTY
OF MURDER
:â â ; The Slayer of Mrs.
Clute to Die on the
Gallows.
The Jury Unanimous in
the Verdict of
Death.
Attorney Schooler's Fruitless
Attempt to Save His
Client.
SCENES IN THE COURTROOM
Prosecuting Attorney Hoimer Rldl
cruioa the Argument of the
Defense-
Albert Frederick George Verenese
neckockhoff, alias Albert Hoff, was ad-
Judged guilty of the murder of Mrs.
Mary Clute In Judge Cook's court
yesterday afternoon and will pay the
penalty of death for his atrocious
crimp. The Jury was out but twentj'
two minutes and was unanimous in its
verdict of execution as the only possi
ble expiation that could be made by
the murderer.
When the gong Bounded in court an
nouncing that a decision had been
reached, the room was thrown Jnto a
Ftate of excitement and nervous an
ticipation to know the naturo of the
verdict.
As the Jurors filed into the room and
resumed their seats in the Jury box
Hoff kept his head down arid his eyes
riveted on the table before him. He
showed or exhibited no emotion until
he raised his eyes to attempt to read
his doom in the immobile features of
the men in whose hands rested life
and death. His face immediately be
came pale and he showed every indica
tion of nervousness born of despair, as
hot as much as an assuring or convinc
ing glance could be ootained lrom
those from whom he sought encourage
ment.
Upon the question of the court ask
ing whether an agreement had been
reached Foreman "W. G. Doane rose arid
with nervous hesitancy read the fol
lowing verdict: "We, the Jury, find
the defendant, Albert Hoff, guilty of
mi.iritr in the first degree." Through
ne/y.cusness ho substituted John fui
Albert, and the court imme lately de
rnanderi the paper to be reread and af
terward filed.
When the words of doom fell upon
the convicted murderer Hoff endeav
ored to smile, but failed signally, as his
features instantly relapsed into a look
of utter. and hopeless despair.
After the dismissal of the Jury two
Deputy Sheriffs walked to where Hoff
was sitting and elapsed the manacles
on the emaciated wrists of the mur
derer. His old faded straw hat was
placed on his head and drawn down
over his -eyes and he was escorted from
the court, his first step to the gallows,
being placed in the tanks in the prison
below. Later he was conveyed to the
County Jail, where he will remain un
til sent to San Quentin for execution.
The date of hanging will be fixed sixty
days from the sth of the present month,
being less than six months from the
time the murder was committed.
The trial has been one of the short
est ever held in this city and the chain
of circumstantial evidence woven about
the prisoner is considered perfect.
. An unusual number of female spec
tators were in attendance yesterday !
and stepped over one another in trying I
to. get a glimpse of the puny body of I
the murderer.
The ruling argument of Attorney
Bchopier in trying to prove the inno
cence of his client was to fix up an
alibi on the fatal 15th of December.
In advancing a theory in explanation
of the blood stains on the murderous
coupling-pin and disputing the fact
that Hnff had at one time used such an
instrument, he declared, on the one
hand, that the supposed blood was
nothing but iron rust and, on the other,
that the possession of such an Instru
ment was not conclusive proof that the
one used by Hoff was the same as that
by which the crime was perpetrated.

Terrible
Speedily Cured By
CUTICURA
My baby was about four weeks old when he
began to suffer from that terrible disease,
Eczema. I tried every remedy I thought
would do him good. I even called In the
doctor who told me it would wear away in
time, but I used his medicine to no account. I
did not know what to do with him. He cried
all the time and his face was equal to a raw
piece of meat, it was horrible, and looked as
if there was never any ekin on it. I had to
carry him around on a pillow. I was fairly
discouraged. I was then recommended to use
( ' i-Ti' riu Rem rimes. The flrit time I used
them I could see the change. I used about
half a box of CcncrÃA (ointment), and not
<ne half cake of Ccticu&a Soap, and at the
end of one short week my baby was entirely
cured. There has never been a trace of it
since, fo-day his bkin is as smooth and soft
as a piece of silk. Mas. J. C. FREESE,

he said, "that Mrs. Clute was not
killed with that coupling-pin, but was
murdered by blows struck by a hammer
or the pole of a hatchet."
In the closing argument made In
behalf of the people by Prosecuting
Attorney Hosmer, the complete chain
of circumstances surrounding Hoff as
the real murderer was recapitulated,
and the statements made by Schooler
alleging that the crime had been com
mitted with a hammer, etc., ridiculed.
Hosmer proved, by citing the testi
mony of Mrs. Legg, a witness in the
case, that Hoff instead ut being the
first to- leave the house the night of the
murder was the last.
When Mrs. Legg heard the death
shriek of the dying woman shortly af
ter 5 o'clock, she ran up the stairs
leading to the apartments of Mrs.
Clute.
At this time It was proven that Hoff
had not as yet left the building and
still carried the weapon with which he
murdered the unfortunate woman in
his possession.
"It is a fact," said Hosmer, "that
when Mrs. Legg entered the hallway
that night the blood-stained instrument
of death was not behind the door,
where it was afterward found, but was
in the clasped hands of Hoff, who at
tempted to conceal it by holding his
hands in front of him.
"He did not want to part with it yet,"
said the attorney, "as he feared he
would have to use it again. That pin
was not thrown behind the door until
the murderer heard the retreating steps
of Mrs. Legg."
Upon the conclusion of the prosecu
tion Judge Cook read his final charge
to the Jury, which was an exhaustive
discussion of the facts of the case and
entering into the minutest details of
the definition and exact meaning of cir
cumstantial evidence and the attend
ant judicial construction placed upon
various words in the case.

THE SAST FRAKCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
COMBINE
OUT FOR
REVENGE
To Punish the Man
Who Got Win
drem to Bid.
The Gauge Strictly Ap
plied to the Work of
Contractor Bingham.
R. H. Copp, Whose Bond Was
Rejected, Is a Responsi
ble Surety.
MORRIS AVENUE SEWER.
RoÃtdÂ«nts on the Thoroughfare Ap
preciate the Good Service Ren
dered by The Call.
People living on Morris avenue, a lit
tle thoroughfare between Fifth and
Sixth and Brannan and Bryant streets,
appreciate The Call's efforts to pro
mote efficiency, honesty and celerity in
the performance of street work. Im
mediately after the fact was published
that an iron stone pipe sewer, which
had been uncovered for repairs, had
so remained exposed seven weeks, the
Street Department put a small gang of
men on the Job and the nuisance is
now abated.
Inquiry brings to light the fact that
R. H. Copp, whose bond on Windrem's
b'd to do Alamr. Square work was re
jected by the Street Committee of the
Supervisors, is in every sense a re
sponsible surety. He is the owner of
thirty acres of land within the limits
of the town of Rocklin. Less than six
weeks ago he was accepted on a bond
in this city where the amount of the
security demanded was $9000. The
Street Committee would not accept him
for $200.
Mr. Copp in a statement made to The
Call's expert said: "Dowling came to
me and called attention to the language
of the bond and stated that I had sworn
that I was a resident and freeholder of
San Francisco. I told him if the bond
was in that form I had signed it under
a misapprehension, and at his request
made an affidavit to that effect. 7 ; I
signed the bond in good faith and know
that the security offered was ample."
As the details of the transaction come
to light It is made clear that the Su
pervisors of the Street Committee were
not looking for good security, but were
casting about with the assistance of
Dowling to find some pretext for throw
ing out Windrem's bid and awarding
the contract to Dowling at the fig
ures originally agreed upon when the
"private arrangement" to do the work
was made. Windrem expresses a de
termination to submit to the board In
writing all of the facts concerning the
rejection of his bid. The expose may
engage the attention of Supervisors
who were not in the secrets of the com
bine and incidentally reveal the names
of the parties who made the private
arrangement to do the - work on \ the
quiet without opening the job to pub
lic competition. The . awkward fact
already confronts the board that Mr.
Ambrose, the Superintendent of Streets,
knew , nothing about the i arrangement
or understanding until he saw Dow
ling's men at work on the Job. .
It will be interesting for the public
to definitely understand , whether a lit
tle clique or combine has been organ
ized at the new City Hall to : usurp thÂ«
functions of the â¢ Board \of Supervisors
and the Street Department. ; â¢ - The job
in : which â  Dowling is concerned :. is â  not
the only. "private arrangement" scheme
of the season. The . City Street â¢ Im
provement Company is going ; ahead
with the work of patching and â¢ other
wise repairing accepted streets on some
kind of an * understanding : which is
contrary to law. and public interest. v
J. . Bingham, the ; contractor who , has
th'i 'contract for paving â¢ Goujr'i 'â â  street
between : Turk and Eddy with * basalt
blocks, is not in the good graces; of the
combine. It is suspected that Bingham
prompted Windrem ~; to get :in Â« and bid
against Dowling for the Alamo - Square
work, and in order to get eVen with him
it was decided by the combine to meas
ure every . block i that 'Â£ he * laid Â«on % the
Gough-street Job. : Tr><Â» inspector of the
Street Department i puts ' the gauge on
evel 7 Wock that Â§jÂ£gfaMl puts dpwn.
and If a single stone Is found to be a
shade above the size prescribed by the
specifications, the contractor Is obliged
to take it up and exclude it from the
work. Bingham is doing the work for
fourteen and seven-eighths cents a
square foot, and is so constantly har
assed that it is not possible for him to
get any benefit from the contract.
On Eighth street, between Brannan
and Townsend, the City Street Im
provement Company has the contract
for paving a block with basalt. The
contract price is twenty-one cents a
square foot. Big blocks can be used in
this work without any interference or
protest from the inspectors of the
btreet Department. The gauge is not
laid down in arbitrary fashion on the
Eighth-street work. Any one doubting
the statement can go and examine the
basalt blocks.
9" Octavia street, between Ellis and
Eddy, where the Union Contracting and
Paving Company has a contract for
puaing down basalt blocks, ths gacge
is not used to embarrass the contractor.
Any one can go there and see that
blocks exceeding in size the limit of
the specifications ha/3 been laid down.
Â»Â« stor y SÂ°es that Huffman, who
testified some weeks ago In divorce pro
ceedings in Oakland that he paid $10
a month for his Job as inspector, is the
man who makes life unbearable for
any contractor outside of the combine,
He makes it a special point to see that
the gauge is strictly applied to Bing
ham s work on Gough street.
No fault is found with the Street De
partment for holding Bingham down to
the specifications, but the point is
raised that other contractors, who are
getting top prices for work, ought to
be held strictly to account.
THRASHED THE LANDLORD.
Max Gallick, Actioneer, and Two
Expressmen, Convicted of Dis
turbing the Peace.
Max Gallick of the Columbia auction
house, 1057 Market street, and William J.
Lunney and John Bowlan, expressmen,
were convicted in Judge Conlan's court
yesterday on the charge of disturbing
the peace, and were ordered to appear for
sentence to-morrow.
"Professor" Woodward was the occu
pant of a house at 100H4 Fillmore street
till March 29, when he left, owing the
landlord, William La.geman, $30 for rent.
Woodward sold part of his furniture to
Gallick, and when Lageman heard of it
he went to Gallick and notified him not
to go near the house, as he wanted his
rent.
That night Gallick. who had got posses
sion of the keys of the house from Wood
ward, drove up with the two expressmen
and piled a lot of furniture into the house
and hung out the usual red flag. Lageman
protested and Gallick and the expressmen
threw him out.
The Judge, in convicting the defendants
yesterday, said that numerous complaints
had been received by the police about the
way in which certain auctioneers acted
in holding sales of furniture in houses
where they were not wanted, and he was
determined to put a stop to it, if possible,
by making an example of Gallick.
SEARCHING FOR
AN EMPLOYE
A: Salmon Packer v Placed in
>> a Very Peculiar
Position.
Gave a Contract and Afterward Found
That He Had Made a
Mistake.
â  Last evening Mr. HumÂ© of the Hume
Salmon Packing and Commission Mer
chant I Company called at police head
quarters \ and reported a ' case so j tangled
in its construction that the ; detectives
were at a loss just how to proceed. Hume
stated last evening in the office of the
Chief of Police that he has large salmon
canning properties and that he Is always
in search of men whom he is able to hire
and send to the packing plants in Alaska.
A - few . weeks ago . a ! man - named
Atkins called at his office and asked
for a position, stating that ' he thor
oughly, understood- the salmon . pack
ing business and In ; consequence a
; contract was drawn up and. a. portion
of the proposed salary advanced. It was
arranged that the hired man should leave
on the steamer Ferris S. Thompson for
the north, but at the last moment he was
withdrawn - from the steamer â  and told
that he * would be â  allowed to make the
trip on the Harvester. - â  -
Before the steamer sailed," however, Mr.
Hume, according to his own statement,
learned "that the man he had hired was
of a ; character not ;to be entrusted with
duttes which would necessarily fail upon
him. . Then the salmon - packer called his
employe Into the office and asked that
the contract be returned and >in t a mild
way i explained the reasons therefore. V It
was then discovered that money had been
advanced on the contract. .In a day ;â  or
two the company â¢ received notice from'
Attorney Hutton that he must appear in
a suit, as he was sued for j money due !on
the - contract and '"> board l for the ; time
which the contract had been running. â¢'
Although surprised, Mr. Hume deter
mined to ask the aid of the police in find
ing: the man, as he ; states i that ;he would
rather take chances on sending him north
than *to spend his time in \ fighting a law
suit. It l- is ,; for ; this Â» reason that Hume

RECORDS GO
TO THE WALL
AT BERKELEY
College Athletes Make
New Marks in
Four Events.
Drum, "Walsh, Broughton
and Bakewell Distin
guish Themselves.
Annual Championship Games
Draw Out a Large
Throng.
A TRIUMPH FOR DRUM.
Broughton Clears Over Twenty-
Two Feet in a Running
Jump.
As large a crowd as ever packed the
stands 'around the Berkeley cinder path
saw the young collegians shatter records
yesterday. Before the annual champion
ship field day was half finished the spec
tators were kept guessing, and the pre
vailing query was, What next?
The races were not exciting or even
more than ordinarily interesting. This
I was chiefly due to the superiority of a
j few, brilliant performers over their com
| petitors. Drum, whose athletic reputa
! tion is ever on the increase, mounted an
| other rung on the ladder of fame, break
ing, the college record on the Berkeley
I track in the 220-yard sprint. The distance
he covered in 23 seconds, which, when the
slowness of the track is considered, is
equal to at least 22 seconds. Drum ran a
slow 100. and did not enter the 440, nursing
his physical energies for a coup-de-grace
In the middle distance sprint.
The mile walk record was shattered
when Walsh, without any severe pushing,
! broke the tape at a pace of 7 minutes and
24 seconds. For several years 7% minutes
was winning time at Berkeley, but in
Walsh the college has, now : a man who
has made a- study of pedestrianism.
Another : record that went glimmering
was the : : 120 - hurdles. Ben Bakewell,
brother , to the famous hurdler, who: es
tablished records in years gone by, ran
the high hurdles in 16 seconds, making a
new record for the California track. The
best previous performance over the same
ground was one-fifth of a second slower.
The star event of i the day, and that
which eclipsed all others in the lopping
off of fractions, was the performance of
Broughton in the distance Jump. He
cleared just twenty-two feet nine and a
half inches of ground in a bound. Only
once .; before has - a leap :of that length
been made In athletic competition on this
coast, that of Schifferstein. in ' the old
days of the Olympic Club, when he made
a record for himself by Jumping twenty
three feet. When Broughton ; made his
longest jump the ; spectators realized, be
fore the distance was announced, that
something unusual had happened, and a
wild burst of applause followed his effort
The enthusiasm continued, and when the
official announcer told his tale, nothing
but shouts and ; college yells -were heard
for several minutes. When the congratu
latory ejaculations subsided. Drum ran
his record-smashing 220, and again Juve
nile delirium flourished. ,

THE MAN WHO WILL LEAD OUR ARMY IN CASE OF WAR
WITH every change in the Cu
ban situation there comes to
the front some conspicuous
American upon whom are
focused the eyes of the
world.
TVhen the United States battle-ehlp
Maine was destroyed in the harbor of
Havana Captain Pigsbee was the hero
df the hour. After him came Fitz
hugh Lee, the American ConÃul-Gen
eral to Cuba, who, by his firm insist
ence upon protecting: the nation's in
terests in Cuba, became the chief fig
ure In the exciting panorama of pass
ing: events. Then President McKinley,
cool, conservative and alert, stepped
Into the foreground, and, by the Influ
. ence of his strong personality, obtained
by the unanimous vote of Congress an
..appropriation of $50,000,000 for the na
tional defense.
And now comes Nelson A. Miles,
commander of the United States army,
upon whom, in the event of war, will
.devolve the direction of the nation's
fighting forces.
NelÃon A. Miles now la a major-gen
eral. He Is a born flgrhter, an .exper
ienced tactician, and a thorough dis
ciplinarian. Few men with the same
military training: have risen to his rank
In the armies of the world. Shall he
oobtinue us a major-general, or shall
the more distinguished title of liteuten-
Hjit-gen>-ral be conferred upon him?
Shall the forces of the United States
be. commanded by an officer of inferior
. title to that of the commander of the
.other armi-'S ->f the world, or shall his
', ..rank, as well as his position, be placed
on. a level with that of the heads of
the armies in the other great nations?
..- These are questions to which Con.
ygrees, in connection with Its considera
,. tlon of the Cuban situation, is giving
a great deal of thought. Major-Gen
.. feral Miles, for thirty-five years a con
: : spicuouÃ member of the United States
..army, has been proposed for the ex
alted rank of lieutenant-general. There
Is-, pending before Congress a Joint res
â  iKutiqn to make him, in title as well
; as in fact, the supreme head of the na
tion's army. It is contended that hÂ«
should be T.ieutenant-General Miles not
.'only bemuse he now Is but one of threÂ«
' major-generals in the army, but be
â  cause of the years of distinguished ser
.Vl. i' he has rendered to his country.
â¢â¢.-â¢ Army officers are keenly interested In
'the joint resolution now before Con
.gi-ess, and thousands of American cit
izens share with them the feeling that
this is one of the first questions that
should be settled. With three major
generals in the regular army, and witn
o;ne of these major-generals in com
: mand, Boldiers and citizens alike feel
. n kf>pn interest in knowing whether
.'Congress will decide or refuse to make
the present head of the army an officer
â pi supreme rank over all other officers.
\Vhy not, they ask, have one lieuten
ant'gencral?
â¢â¢â¢.'â¢â¢Upon but six men since the nation
'was born has the title of lieutenant
general been conferred. Washington,
Scott, Grant. Sherman, Sheridan and
: .Schofleld comprise the Mat of penerala
who thus have been honored. And of
these six alone Grant was â¢ honored
with the still higher title of general.
When the United States feared a war
â¢with France in 1798. and George Wash
ir.erton was called to the command or
th- army, he was given the title or
. . lieutenant-general.
Another military hero, "Winfleld Scott,
was made lieutenant-general half a
century later.
.'During. the Civil War the title was
upon Ulysses S. Grant, and
when he was made general, in 1866,
William T. Sherman became lieuten
ant-peneral. Upon the retirement of
. I.l<nu*nant-General Sherman that title
: whs conferred upon "Phil" Sheridan,
.wh.o succeeded to th*> office. Hut when
Sheridan died, in is*s, the title of Heu
;frpn ant- general passed away with him.
: ;-Joh'n M. Schofield, head of tho army
after; Sheridan, was mad- lieutenant
. general by special act of Congress
eight months before his retirement.
:When Major-General Nelson A. Miles

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
M/UOF QENipAL JMELSOJ^I J\. MILES.
If War Is declared Qeneral JYliles Would, unless superseded, direct the in>>asi on and command the
Volunteer army. present he is in command of the regular standing army, U. S. J\., and
directly controls all forts inland and along our coasts. Jhere is a bill noW before Gongress to
raise him to the rank of Lieu^enant-Qeneral, a title that has been held bvj only six soldiers in
the history of the nation â Washington, Scott, Qrant, Sherman, Sheridarv and Schofield.
have been made during the last two
years to re-establish the title.
There is no army politics in the Joint
resolution now pending In both
branches of Congress to make Nelson
A. Miles a lieutenant-general. Demo
crats and Republicans favor It and
other Democrats and Republicans op
ptrse it. General Miles was designated
to succeed General SchoHeld by former
President Cleveland, through Daniel S.
Lamont, his Secretary of War. Yet
Secretary Lamont, three months after
General Miles' elevation, wrote a let
ter in which he strongly opposed reviv
ing the title of lieutenant-general. On
the other hand, General Russell A. Al
ger, Mr. Lament's successor as Secre
tary of War, is as strongly in favor of
making Miles a lieutenant-general as
Secretary Lamont was opposed to it.
It Js a very interesting side liÃht to
all of the current war talk, is this ques
tion of whether the armies of the
United States shall be commanded by a
major-general, with two other major
generals as assistants, or by a lieuten
ant-general. In the event of war, the
Federal forces would be commanded by
Major-General Miles, under whose im
mediate direction has been carried on
all of the work of coast defense under
taken since the passage of the $50,000,
000 appropriation.
Under Major-General Miles would be
Major-General Wesley Merrltt and Ma
jor-General John R. Brooke, with Brig
adier-General Graham in charge o-f the
Department of the South. There would
be no confusion of major-generals,
probably, and no member of the army
could be excused should he forget that
Major-General Miles is the senior offl
cer of that title. But Major-General
Merritt, now commanding the Depart
ment of the East, undoubtedly would
take charge of the forces in the field,
and Major-General Brooke, who would
be sent to Governor's Island to take
charge of the Department of the East
in Major-General Merritt's absence,
would be certain to figure prominently
in .subsequent events.
It is partly because of the confusion
that might follow the multiplicity of
major-generals that Congress is being
urged to take immediate action on the
resolution to make Major-General
Allies a lieutenant-general. If that is
dune there will be no reason for con
fusion as to who is the ranking h,ead
of the army.
Few, if any, other armies of the
world, are organized without a lieuten
ant-general, and it was because of this
fact that the present movement to re
vive the title was started. General
Miles has scores of enthusiastic ad
mirers among the officers of the army
who would like to see him made lieu
tenant-general, both because he is the
head of the army and because they be
lieve his services entitle him to the
honor. They hold that a man who
organized a volunteer company when
he was 22 years old, served throughout
the Civil War with distinction, and af
terward made a world-wide reputation
as an Indian fighter should receive the
title of lieutenant-general when called
upon to perform the duties of that re
sponsible position.
It was Daniel S. Lamont who fur
nished the first argument in opposition
to conferring the title of lieutenant
general upon Nelson A. Miles. That
fact attained interest because of the
other fact that it was Secretary La
mont who, obeying the instructions of
President Grover Cleveland, formally
placed General Miles at the head of the
United States army. Since Secretary .
Lamont first made known his opposi
tion, more than two years ago, certain
Southern loaders, nearly all of whom
were prominent in the Civil War, have
joined in the effort to defeat the
project.
General Miles was a mere boy when
he entered the Union army, and he rose
so rapidly during the conflict that he
came out of the army with the title of
brevet major-general, although he was ,
but 26 years old. After the war, when
Jefferson Davis was sent to Fortress
Monroe as a prisoner, Miles was select
ed by Secretary Stanton to take charge
of the noted captive. Those were un
certain times, and the young officer
took every precaution to see that his
prisoner did not escape. It has been
charged against him that General Miles
put Davis in chains, and because of
this charge there is much opposition to
making him a lieutenant-general on
the part of Southern members of Con
gress.
General Miles' friends have explained
that in his treatment of the President
of the Confederacy he merely obeyed
explicit instructions from Washington,
but the vote in the Senate Committee
on Military Affairs the other day indi
cated that the Davis incident still ran
kles in the bosom of the Southerners.
Six members of the Senate committee
voted in favor of the Joint resolution to
make the head of the army a lieuten
ant-general, and the three Senators
who voted in the negative were Sena
tors Bate, Cockrell and Pettus, all from
Southern States.
Major-General Miles became the head
of the army towa- I the end of 1895, and
the proposition to make him a lieuten
ant-general was brought before Con
gress early In 1596. General Joseph R.
Hawley of Connecticut was chairman
of the Senate Committee on Military
Affairs, and he sent a copy of the joint
resolution to Mr. Lamont, then Secre
tary of War. Senator Hawley requested
Secretary Lamont to give the commit
tee his opinion on the bill.
In his reply Secretary Lamont, after
recalling the fact that but six men had
held the title of lieutenant-general in
the history of the nation, said:
"In no instance has an officer attained
this rank until he has commanded the
whole of a separate army in battle and
active campaign. The grade has been
revived three times since its first cre
ation, always with the object of con
ferring complimentary rank upon gen
erals who had rendered 'eminent and
distinguished services' or those 'most
distinguished for courage, skill and
ability' in war."
As for the major-generals of recent
times. Secretary Lamont wrote: "The
present major-generals of our army at
tained brilliant reputations for gal
la,ntry while commanding subdivisions
of army corps during the late conflict,
and have added to their laurels since
by the efficient performance of arduous
services on the frontier, but It is no re
flection upon those excellent officers to
say that the services they have so far
rendered are not of that exalted char
acter that has hitherto been regarded
as prerequisite to the advancement now
proposed."
This opinion of Secretary Lamont
evidently prevailed with the members
of the Fifty-fourth CongTess, for the
Joint resolution was passed in neither
branch, although it made some pro
gress in the House. Since that time,
however, the distinguished services
performed by General Miles have come
to be better understood, and there is a
strong feeling that the present head of
the army will be a lieutenant-general
before the expiration of the present
session, Secretary Alger's earnest ad
vocacy of the joint resolution is cer
tain to have a marked effect, and Gen
eral Miles' admirers in the army are
losing no opportunity to press forward
the project.
In whatever light one chooses to view
the matter. General Miles' is a most
Interesting personality. He won the
confidence of the principal men in the
Civil War by his conduct during the
four years' conflict, and he since has
made a world-wide reputation as a
fearless Indian fighter. He has the
manner of a successful business man
when out of his uniform, and is every
Inch the soldier when engaged in any
military function. He is quiet, firm
and resolute, and at all times most gen
tlemanly. To the casual observer Gen
eral Miles appears to be a man' who has
had a successful business career, rather
than a man who had been fighting for
two-thirds of his active life and who
has recovered from four serious bullet
wounds.
One effective answer Is given by the
friends of General Miles to those per
sons who oppose making him a lieu
tenant-general on the ground that he
did not attain to sufficient prominence
In the Civil War. That answer is that
no man. either in the Civil War or in
any other conflict, attained to the dis
tinction at the age of 26 years that
Miles won under Grant. When this of
ficer's age is kept in mind, what he
did from IS6I to 1865 becomes most con
spicuous.
He was not quite 22 years old when
Fort Sumter was fired upon, and was
then employed in a store not far from
Boston. He had come into the pos
session of $WOO. and promptly devoted
this money to organizing: n. company of
volunteers. He succeeded in borrow
ing $2500 more from a relative, givin?
his personal note as security. With
this money young Miles equipped his
company, was elected as its captain,
and made all arrangements to go to the
front. But the Governor of Massa
chusetts, learning the age of the young
captain, refused to issue a commission
to him. Instead he made Miles a lieu
tenant, and in that capacity he joined
the Federal forces.

HUNTING THE EGRET
-IF YOU'RE CRAFTY AND QUICK AND ACCURATE YOU CAN SOMETIMES BRING DOWN'SEV
ERAL OF THE SCARY BIRDS BEFORE THEY GET OUT OF RANGE. BUT A FEW OF 'EM
PAYS B1G."_ D AV!D W. BENNETT. PROFESSIONAL EGRET HUNTER.
PI i.mona.. 1 nril Lâ David W.Ben
nett, the most experienced and
famous hunter in the world for
Wild egrets and herons, has been
in Los Angeles and in his orange
grove in the San Gabriel Valley for a
-week. He has been resting In Califor
nia for a month, and he will go back
to hunting egrets off the coast of Mex
ico and Central America some time in
May.
Once in a year or two he may go to
New Orleans with his great egret and
heron feathers to meet by appointment
Parisian millinery buyers. An average
sale of feathers on his semi-annual
trips to San Francisco amounts to $2500
or $3000. That this extraordinary va
riety of hunting pays is attested by
Mr. Bennett's bank stock and valuable
real estate in Los Angeles and San Ga
briel Valley.
"I have been shooting egrets and her
ons exclusively since 1874." said Mr.
Bennett. "Along in the summer of IST3
I was prospecting for silver mines off
the coast of Yucatan. I shot a dozen
or so herons that were wading about
a marsh or lagoon, and the long white
plumes were so delicate and filmy-like
that I took them to my sisters ir New
THE CHEERFUL KIND OF BOMB THE AMERICAN PRESS FIRED AT SPAIN LAST WEEK
Orleans a few months later. Our next
door neighbor was a wholesale milliner,
and he said he would buy such stuff
for $5 for each plume and take all I
could get. 1 could have easily got and
brought home over 500 such heron
plumes, and. of course, I resolved to go
back to Central America the very next
year to hunt egret feathers. That is
how I came to get into this business.
"The first two years I was hunting
down in Yucatan and Honduras I
cleared, over and above expenses and
my living, the sum of $6000, but
that was when there was no one who
competed with me in egret hunting, ex
cept a lot of lazy. Stupid drunken na
tives of Central America, and there
were thousands of egrets more in those
days than now. On some days I used
to get as many as twenty herons or
egrets, and I have never found'any oc
cupation so profitable as getting thirty
of more egrets a week at about $4 for
each of their plumes and feathers.
"Where do I hunt now? Off the west
coast of Mexico, near Tepee and Sina
loa. I hunted for fifteen years in every
part of Central America, and I had
the natives work for me at times, so
we made the birds mighty scarce down
there before we got through. I began
hunting down in the Gulf of California
and later in the bays and lagoons on
the Pacific Ocean side of Mexico in
ISSB and I believe there's enough birds

in that region to keep me busy as long
as I care to stay by the egret hunting
business, But everywhere in the re
gions I have been in and have ever
heard about a rapidly growing scarcity
of egrets is evident.
"I am sure that in a dozen years or
more, if the fashion for feathers in
women's millinery prevails as now,
there will be very few egrets left on
the west coast of the whole western
continent. I have talked with men
who used to .hunt egrets and herons In
the marsh lands and bays of Peru,
the United States of Colombia, and
Ecuador for the Paris and other Euro
pean markets, and they tell me that
the birds have been so thoroughly
wiped out down that way that it is a
loss of time and money to try to get
a living by hunting egrets or heron*.
"Egret feathers are now sold entirely
by weight. When I went into get
ting the feathers as a business I Sold
them at so much a plume, and so much
for smaller or discolored feathers.- The
Parisian milliners, who rule the orna
mental feather market of the world,
make and unmake all the fashions, and
create demands in our line of busi
ness, began to buy egret and heron
feathers by the ounce, and that prac
tice was quickly followed by New York
and Philadelphia ornamental feather
dealers. Under the McKinley tariff
law there is a duty of 10 per cent ad
valorem on all my egret feathers senl
to New York, but now they are ad
mitted free of duty, and we hunters
get the 10 per cent difference. The price
for my feathers depends upon the con
dition of the stock and the manner and
place in which I market it. I have
to take several things into considera
tion in selling a season's shooting of
some $3000 or $4000 worth of egret
feathers.
"If I go to the City of Mexico and
wait for a buyer from Paris I may get
$24 an ounce for plumes and $9 an ounce
for egret fe-thers. If I send the stock
to New York or San Francisco I get
$28 an ounce for my plumes, if I am
dealt with fairly, and. from $9 to $11
for the common feathers.
"Years ago I used to have some tough
experiences with some of the whole
sale feather dealers of New York, but
now that I have learned to know my
men and have made a reputation for
my wares I seldom get cheated. In
IRB4 I lost a whole season's harvest of
feathers and plumes, amounting to
$4500. because of a rascally buyer in
Philadelphia.
"Soiled egret feathers and plumes are
dyed and then used on millinery goods.
The least discoloration of the milky
whiteness of an egret plume will bring
its value down from 30 to 50 per cent.
When a feather buyer looks over fine
feathers he uses a large magnifying
glass and scrutinizes each plume with
all the nicety of a bird examining a
flower. A background of white is al
ways used with each plume, so as to
make the faintest discoloration more
perceptible. That is the time that the
hunter or seller has to put ir his best
bits of fine work, for a shrewd buyer
will find some defect in color, shape or
filminess in the whole of a man's stock
and knock the price down $1000 or more
unless the seller raises a rumpus at
such proceedings and acts independent.
"A good season's harvest for one who
Is in the egret feather business on the
scale I am is about fifty-five ounces of
plumes and one rundred and thirfy
ounces of small feathers. The best sea
son I have ever had was in 1882, when
I had four good shooters at work for
me among the lagoons of Nicaragua. I
got about $6000 that year clear, after
seven months' work. I sold the whole
feather crop to a buyer from Brussels,
Belgium, that year, and hi paid me $30
an ounce for my finest plumes.
"Only a very few feathers are avail
able on the egret. On the heron there
are three times aa many but heron
feathers are worth less than half as
much as egret feathers. The expe
rienced feather buyers know the differ
ence In the feathers at a' glance, and
many feet away, too. It is useless to
mix heron and egret feathers together
and try to palm them off on a buyer
who knows his business. A full-grown
egret will yield about one-fourth of an
ounce of feathers and one-sixth of an
ounce of plumes. None of the other
feathers are touched and it takes much
experience for a hunter to know just
what will be marketable. All the avail
able egret plumes are on the bird's back
just back of the *;il, but the heron has
marketable feathers on both back and
breast.
"We generally reckon that an Qgret
that is got without damage to the
feathers is worth about $3 20, and each
heron $1 So.
"Although the wholesale feather buy
ers are wonderfully sharp and exact
ing with the hunters as to the different
prices for egret and heron feathers,
there is almost universal deception of
the consumers and the general public
on these points. I have been in first
class millinery stores in San Francisco,
New York and other cities and have ,
seen heron feathers and plumes sold
by apparently he/nest saleswomen for
genuine egrets. I have been on Fifth
and Madison avenues in New York, and
on the promenade streets in San Fran
cisco many a time to observe, and it is
seldom that I have seen first-class
egret plumes worn. I know, too, that
marvy of the rich and fashionable
women whom I passed thought they
were wearing the best egrets.
"How do we hunt egrets and herons?
Well, we have to live on the outskirts
of civilization when we go after these
birds. For days and nights at a time
we make our homes in little rowboats,
built canoe-shaped for fast traveling,
and we live among the marshes and
reeds of the lagoons and bays under a
fierce semi-tropic sky. It is the hardest
sort of life, and no one. however robust,
could keep at it for more than a few
months at a time. The miasma of the
water and the poisonous atmosphere all
about us at night soon fills one's blood
with rheumatism and fevers. We hun
ters take our potion of quinine and
whisky at regular intervals several
times a day. We have canned foods
and metal boxes for our feathers and
our ammunition in the boats with up.
We use the very best shotguns and No.
5 shot, which does effective work with
out mangling the birds. An egret hun
ter must be the foxiest kind of a hun
ter. Â«
"Talk about the artifice and skill of
duck and squirrel hunting! Why, both
are boys' play by the side of shooting
egrets or herons for a living. These
birds are the most cautious and wary
of any I have ever known or heard of.
I have known herons to desert a whole
nest of young, because they saw an old
hat lying near the reeds where the nest
had been made and their suspicions
were thereby aroused.
"Egrets seem to almost smeil the
presence of a man with a gun. I know
of no decoy that could be used with
egrets or herons, but even if it could
once be used, that would be the last of
that trick in that locality, for by some
sort of freemasonry all the bird's family
and cousins for miles around would be
warned of the delusion.
"When we go out for a fortnight's
or a month's shoot we never leave our
boats even for an hour. W T e get our
birds either at early evening or at the
first break of day. We seldom get
birds at evening and then the follow
ing dawn, for at the report of a gun
every heron or egret in the region flies
straight away, and will not come back
to that particular spot for four or five
days. Even then they return with won
derful caution. So we move from one
part of a bay or lagoon to another at
midday, when the birds are off feed

"Sometimes we get as many as ni

but more often the number is seven or
eight. Years ago, when egrets and
herons were very plentiful in Central
America. I have killed nine birds In as
many shots before they got Â«t Â°i
my reach. When we have deliverea
our volleys, and the unharmed mraa
have flown away, we row about anu

"Extreme care must be exercised to
get the feathers and plumes as free as
possible from discolored water or tne
stain of weeds. Every week we nave
to throw away the carcass of an egret
or heron because the feathers and
plumes are blood-stained or twisted
out of shape.
"After we have got our birds ana
have picked the few feathers we want
from each we plan another onslaught
in another locality. If we are lucky
we may soon get located four or five
miles away amid reeds and foliage un
der cover of darkness, so as to be ready
for more shooting the next morning.
We row about with rare caution, we
seldom speak in loud tones and we do
not even smoke while we are hunting,
because of the extraordinary wariness
of the birds. Many a time I have lain
in one position for hours beneath my
little roof of tules or rushes, because I
saw that a flock of egrets was suspi
cious of the presence of an enemy.
"The shores > f the lagoons of Central
America and the southern part of Mex
ico abound in alligators, while all man
ner of pestiferous stinging flies, gnats
and mosquftoes are in the air. We have
suffered tortures from insect pests, ana
one of my hunting men died in agony
from the poison of gnats several years
ago. When we are on shore we have
danger at night from the puma or
mountain lion, and we always sleep
with fires burning on all sides of our
camp. .
"I brought up with me on this trip
to Los Angeles eleven puma skins,
for sale to fur ruf-makers. I have lost
several Jackasses by the mountain
lions.
"One day I caught a lion in the very
act of attacking one of my donkeys.
The lion, which is simply an enormous
cat. had sprung at the soft flabby neck
of the donkey. and had torn away the
flesh, preparatory to sucking the blood
of the jugular vpin. The lion had evi
dently knockp^ the donkey down at one
spring and had cuffed the animal into
insensibility. The donkey was dead be
fore I got to it. The lion gave some of
the most extraordinary leaps ever made
Tv any beast as I shot at it. I rneas^
ured the distance between the prints
of the forepaws as the jumps were
made and they were about forty feet
apart.
"The egrets and the herons are of the
crane family of birds. The egrets are
small, much like the bitterns and boat
bills of the same family.CHASING SLAVERS

Nefarious Trade.
SPAIN' has always been an enemy
of America!"
During the unpleasantness of
the past five weeks the forego
ing statement has been made by
large numbers of our Congress
men. Many of our people, however,
have been under the impression that
the utterance was largely "jingo
talk."
"But no truer statement was ever
made," said Captain Jackson of this city
a few days ago, when a group of weli
known men were discussing the situa
tion. "I have talked to a number of
men of American birth who have suf
fered at Spain's hands, and while ' I
fully believe every word they said, I
cannot, of course, swear to their state

lively that in regard to this country
the Castilian has on numerous occa
sions violated all laws of honor. This
seems a hard statement to make, but
I can prove it, although to do so it will
be necessary to go back about forty
Years.
"I refer to the days when the slave
traffic was at its height. It was then
that Spain permitted slavers and pi
raies to outfit in her ports and fly the
American flag in order to protect them
selves from English warships that were
Bailing the seas on the lookout for the
tiorrid traffickers in human flesh.
"This was a simple process, accord-
Ing to the Spanish way of reasoning,
where no thought ol" the violation of
treaties was allowed to cut any fig
ure. The prospective slaver purchased
his veÃsel In the United States. Sho
was usually a schooner of fine lines and
large sail area, built more like a yacht
than any craft afloat at that time.
"After acquiring possession of his
purchase the owner took her to Ha
vana, still retaining the American pa
i irs and Bag under which she was sold
to him. Here a Spanish crew was
Bhipped and the vessel outfitted as a
Blaver. This was done with the full
knowledge <>f the Spanish maritime and
customs officials. in fact, these gen
tlemen, aided in the nelarious work
in spite of all the English and Ameri
can "flieials could do to prevent it.
"It was then the custom of these ves
p'-ls to proceed to Africa, where a cargo
'â¢f slaves was obtained, and then, flying
tli" Ktnr.Â« and stripes, attempt to get
back to Cuba. The Spanish Govern
ment never made a single attempt to
stop this traffic, although having full
knowledge of it, but on the other hand
accepted moneys from the owners or
tb" vessels.
"It was while aiding in the putting
down of slavery that I came to my
knowledge of Spanish villainy and
â¢treachery, and even after all these
years r,.> words can do it justice.
"It was about 1856. 1 was just 16 years
ol<l at the time, when I began a three
years' cruise along the west coast of
. Africa as a midshipman in the British
.-.-navy. The slave trade w.ts at its height
and England had a squadron of about
thirty vessels of various classes, en
gaged in putting it down.
"My vessel was the Antelope, a three
gun steam brig. She was able to makÂ«
good time, even under canvas alonr.
and when aided by her paddle wheels
could catch any sailing craft afloat in
those days.
"My three years on this vessel werÂ«
days of excitement and peril. As well
as "the perils of fighting we had to face
the terrible fevers that constantly
raged along the swampy shores of the
Bight of Benin. Our lives were a con
stant turmoil and the roaring of can
non and whizzing of bullets were com
monplace sounds to us. Dead and
wounded men were almost constantly
around us. Several men were killed
on the decks of our vessel, but hun
dreds of the horrid slavers were
stretched out on the decks of their
own. How the demons did fight as
long as they thought they had the ad
vantage. And how quickly they stop
ped and commenced butchering the
helpless cargo in the hold as soon as
things went against them.
"Upon our arrival at Sierra Leone,
the capital of British West Africa, in
January, 1857, we were met by the
commodore with several other vessels
of the squadron. They had arrived in
take on board their several 'prize
crews' that had been bringing v the
prizes captured at different points
along the coast. There were about
twenty slavers all waiting to be broken
up and their material sold for prize
money. Some of the pretty and swift
craft were more fit for yachts, and all
were of American build. No doubt
many could have been disposed of at
good prices, but, alas! their fate was
sealed, and they could never again sail
the seas, for a slave ship, once cap
tured by a British war vessel, had to
be broken up.
"Many an old tar would heave a sigh,
turn his quid of tobacco over and with
tears in his eyes say it seemed almost
a crime to destroy such beautiful craft,
but it had to be done, the stern law
must be obeyed in the interest of hu
manity to prevent any of these vessels
ever again being employed in the slave
trade.
"The thought come" to me that pos
sibly it may be that many erf the poor
sufferers in Cuba at this day are de
scendants of many poor Africans
brought from Africa about that period.
"The slave dealers could afford to lose
two vessels out of three and then make
large fortunes by the traffic. If v
dealer wanted one cargo of slaves he
sent three vessels instead of one, thus
allowing two for capture.
'This will gfve but a faint ideaof how
the traffic was carried on, and it was
ali done by the Spaniards from Cuba,
who sailed their vessels from Havana
under the stars and stripes.
"After our squadron pot to sea on
the search for slaves, my vessel, the
Antelope, was f,-ut a whole month be
fore we had anything to do. But then
our work began in earnest.
"It was early in the morning when
the cry of 'Sail ho!' from the mast
head brought us all on deck.
" 'She's a slaver," cried all the crew at
the same time. Every man jumped to
his place.
"But this craft did not give us much
trouble. She made an effort to escape,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
but the breeze was light and with our
engines we soon overhauled her. Her
captain saw that the game was up and
"We took the entire crew and
dumped them on the nearest land and
sent the schooner in charge of a prize
crew to where the slaves could be re
turned to their homes.
"Our next antagonist waa a terror.
We sighted her at about noon and a
few moments afterward saw the stars
and stripes flung to the breeze. But our
captain waa not fooled. He determined
to see what was on board the vessel,
and gave the sign for her to 'heave to.'
"No attention was paid to it, how
ever. Then the race began. A fine
breeze was blowing, and the schooner
almost got away from us. She fairly
flew over the water with all her can
vas set. Then we sent a shot after her,
and then another and another.
"These tores holes in the canvas and
Blackened her speed, so that we began
to gain on her.
"Seeing that escape was hopeless the
slaver's crew be â> to throw their cargo
overboard. Manacled men and women
were dragged from the vessel's hold
and tossed into the ocean, sinking from
sight almost ins'antly.
"Then we began a musket fire and
picked off some of the leaders. They
made an effort to return it, but their
aim was defective, and none of our
crew was hurt.
"When we did get alongside the ves
sel we were confronted by as hard a
looking crowd of men as I have ever
seen. Cutthroat was stamped on e^ery
one of their Spanish faces. When we
attempted to step on board the fight
began, and I tell you it was a hot one.
Bullets flew over all sides, and the
slavers attempted to board us. All of
them were blinded with liquor and
fought like demons.
"We rapidly thinned out their rp iks,
though, and soon her decks were cov
ered with dead men and running with
blood.
"We soon overpowered the slavers,
and then they ran for cover and
screamed for mercy. This crew was
treated as the others were and we
were ready for the next. We got this
in about three days.
"This time a beautiful schooner was
flying the American flag, and when
hailed answered that she was the
Jupiter of New Orleans, and beyond
that they gave us no satisfactip .. Our
captain, however, sent an officer to
board her and look over her papers.
He found tha,t she was on a trading
voyage, with twenty-one as villainous
looking a lot of dirty, unwashed, cut
throat Spaniards as you ever wanted
to see.
"After a long parley our captain con
cluded that the treaty between the
United States and Great Britain should
for once be violated, and he resolved to
break open the vessel's hatches. This
was done, and there, packed away on a
slave deck, were 120 men and women,
all huddling together from "sheer fear,'
having been previously intimidated to
silence by threats of being thrown
overboard.
"Immediately she was discovered to
be a slave vessel, as if by magic old
glory disappeared from the rigging,
and no papers were to be found on
board, as they had been burnt and the
liag sunk. She was a vessel without
a name, with a Spanish crew, six
American passengers on board and
bound nowhere.
"The American who but ten minutes
before was 'captain' quietly Informed
our officers that they had yet a hun
dred more slaves on shore, which they
were waiting to go for as soon as the
coast was clear of men-of-war. This
capture proved a valuable prize to us,
as she had on board about 3000 doub
loons to purchase cargoes for the two
other vessels. She was sent to Sierra
Leone with a prize crew, and the Amer
icans were cared for on board and sent
home, while the Spaniards we invaria
bly 'dumped' on the nearest beach, af
ter taking everything of value from
them.
"During the next six months we took
four Other prizes along this part of the
coast, all under similar conditions, and
about forty or fifty others were cap
tured by other cruisers. That will givs
you some idea of the magnitude of the
trade carried on by these Spaniards.
"Sometimes a naval commander
more careful and timid and somewhat
afraid of trouble would not force open
these vessels' hatches, and, protected
by the American Hag, the vessels would
sail away with their cargoes of human
beings, invariably to J>e landed at Ha
vana.
"Our next cruise was off and about
the Congo River, where a larger class
of vessel was required to carry off the
larger cargoes of slaves purchased from
the Portuguese slave dealers. The
methods adopted by them were similar,
but with the difference that the barks
were disguised as whalers instead of
traders, as the schooners were in
Benin.
"We took seven more valuable vessels
during our next year's cruise, and four
more off the northern division in the
third year, making a total of fifteen
vessels, containing 3745 slaves, all of
whom were sent to British West Afri
ca, liberated and taught trades.
"For each slave liberated the crews
of the men-of-war were paid as prize
money $25 per head, so we were recom
pensed for our hard service to the
amount of $93,000 head money besides
what the vessels themselves were sold
for, in all about $170,000.
"As our vessel was a fair average of
the cruisers, it will be seen that about
$4,000,000 was the amount spent by
Great Britain in three years, in addi
tion to the cost of her squadron, for
suppressing a traffic carried on by the
Spaniards.
LEARNING MUSIC
UNDER
MME. MARCHES!
ALTHOUGH the name of Matilda
Marchesi, the first vocal teacher
the day, is familiar to Amerl
"cans, yet little is known of her
personality and method. By
some she is described as a tyrant and
the terror of her pupils, while others
make the sweeping assertion that for
any voice except a soprano leggiero her
method is a failure.
Any of Marchesi's pupils can tell of
the patience she has with beginners and
her sympathy with nervousness, while
the best of her celebrated graduates
will show there is no voice she cannot
train.
Marches! was born in Frankfort, Ger
many, about seventy-four years ago.
After studying with Garcia she had a
successful career as a singer in all the
capitals of Europe. She married an
Italian nobleman, the Marquis de Cas
trone de la Rajata, who was himself a
singer of no small merit, his stage
name being Salvatore Marches!. His
wife and daughter have both taken this
name for professional use.
Marchesi's reputation as a teacher
was established 111 Vienna, where she
was for many years director of the
vocal department at the Conservatoire.
She has resided in Paris so long as to
have become almost enti-ely French.
Her beautifully appointed house in the
Rue Jouffroy is a rendezvous for the
celebrated musical people of all na
tions. The music room has been es
pecially arranged for 'he voice. It is
paneled in wood, has a parquet floor
and there are no draperies to interfere
with the sound. Nothing is wanting in
this room to complete the musical edu
cation of the , upils. Mmc Marchesi's
musical library 1b probably one of the
largest and ny valuable private col-
lections known and most of the works
have been dedicated and corrected by
the composers themselves. Every avail
able space in the room is filled with
autograph likenesses of all the cele
brated composers, singers and musi
cians past and present, while under a
glass case in a corner lies a silver
laurel wrea.th surrounded by the
decorations Marchesi has received from
various crowned 1 cads.
Marchesi divides her pupils into four
classes, each one of which meets three
times a week. The two highest are
known as the opera and concert classes,
indicating for which branch the pupils
are preparing. Monsieur Mangin, a
conductor of the Grand Opera, is accom
panist of the opera class and keeps
Marchesi in touch with all cuts and
changes in the productions - ' the
opera. Monsieur Leroux, brother of the
well-known composer, acts as accom
panist to the concert class. The begin
ners' class Marchesi calls her 'kitchen"
where she prepares voices. There are
several small auditions given for the
various classes at her residence during
the term, and occasionally the opera
class gives in costume a series of scenes
from different operas at some small
theater. On these occasions they are
usually assisted by some of the male
singers from the opera. An audition in
which most of the pupils appear is held
at the Salle Erard shortly before the
term closes.
If Mme. Marchesi had not made her
name famous as a teacher her remark
able personality would probably have
asserted Itself in some other way. On
meeting her one would never suppose
her to be 74 years old. Indeed, she pos
sesses an amount of energy and a ca
pacity for work that many a younger
person might envy.
She rises at 6 o'clock, and besides her
four classes, of about ten girls each, she
has many private pupils. She is very
vivacious and has a keen appreciation
of a good joke, besides never being at a
loss for an answer herself. A gentle
man whose curiosity got the better of
his tact once asked her her age, a point
on which she is sensitive. She an
swered, "I am 28 â and the rest." There
are but few of her pupils who do not
look forward to their lessons, for while
never forgetting the subiect in hand,
music, she is sure to have raised a
laugh more than once before the class
is finished. But it is not to be supposed
because Marchesi possesses a fund of
good spirits that her life has been an
easy or altogether happy one. Of nine
children, she has only one living,
Blanche, who is at present in London,
adding to the reputation she has al
ready made in Paris. Madame Blanche
Marchesi does not possess a large voice,
but it has been so beautifully trained,
her production is so perfect and her
diction and style so pure, that she has
established herself among the foremost
artists of the day. Gounod said to Mar
chesi, after hearing her daughter sing,
"Madame, that is your chef-d'oeuvre."
Madame Blanche Marchesi has been
married twice, first to an Austrian
nobleman, from whom she was di
vorced, and the second time to Baron
Cacamisi, an Italian.
Among the famous singers who are
pupils of Madame Marchesi may be
mentioned Grauss, Gerster, Melba and
Calve. The best-known Americans
who have studied with* her are Eames,
Nevada and Mrs. Vanderveer Green,
while San Francisco has been repre
sented by Sibyl Sanderso\i. Frances
Saville, who claims that city as her
birthplace, and Mrs. Gertrude Child,
Thomas Esther Palliser and Ada Cross
ley, two of the best known English
concert singers, complete the list.
It is to be regretted that the arrange
ments Marchesi was making last fall
for a lecture tour in America were not
completed. She would have addressed
her audiences in English, as she adds
to her other talents that of being a
linguist. She speaks eight languages,
three of which she teaches her pupils
to singâ French, German and Italian.
The majority of Marehesl's pupils are
American and as few of them speak
French with any degree of fluency it
is not an uncommon thing to hear Mar
chesi speaking four languages at dif
ferent times in an afternoon. G. B.
BABIES
ON
THE BATTLEFIELD.
A FEW days ago an Afridi's baby
had a pec-.lar experience on the
battlefield. On an Afridl being
shot it was discovered that he
had been carrying a baby, and
the British troops could not leave this
on the ground with the dead man. Of
course . i provision had been made for
such an emergency, but still the sol
diers were quite equal to the occasion
and ca !ed the . ttle stranger with
them on the march. Later on when re
turning, they k" it n m the spot where
they originally found it, and this was
done in full vie. of many of the enemy
in the hope that it would soon be hand
ed over to its other. This little crea
ture had thas had an experience which
will often be referred to in after life.
A somewhat similar thing occurred
during the Russo-Turkish war. While
the soldiers of a Turkish regi: ent were
marching from Plevna up< n Constanti
nople they fei. n with a female infant
which had been deserted The men
took charge of the little lonely child,
and she grew up as the daughter of the
regiment. The most romantic part of
the story, however, remains to be told,
for this Turkish foundling was married
two or three years ago to an officer in
Russia, when her military foster pa
rents provided her with a handsome
dowry.
Last year a man died at Birmingham
who had through life the satisfaction
of knowing that his birthplace was of
a unique character, inasmuch as he was
born on the battlefield of Waterloo. He
was the descendant of a family of sol
diers, and his father, who was with the
Ninety-seventh Cameron Highlanders,
was killed in the memorable engage
ment at Hougemont. The soldier's
wife had followed her husband out, and
thus it happened amid the dta and roar
of battle. Although born under such
circumstances, he did not develop into
a soldier, but, becoming a railway
guard, frequently had the honor of
acting in that capacity to the Queen's
train.
Another romantic story is told in con
nection with the American Civil War.
After one of the battles a baby clothed
in fine apparel was found among the
dead and wounded, and as no one came
forward to claim it, the opinion was
formed that its parents had perished in
the strife. Of course, it was impossible
to say whether it belonged to the
Northern or Southern side, but ulti
mately a Southern soldier and his wife
took the child and cared for her as if
she had been their own. She grew into
a handsome and cultured young lady,
and in course of time married Thomas
E. Watson, farmer and lawyer. This
gentleman was the Populist nominee
for the American Vice-Presidency some
time ago.
Another incident of a baby on the
battlefield is also furnished by
America. It was at the time of the
Revolution, during the invasion of
Charleston, when the country north of
Coopers River was ravaged by Colonel
Tarleton and the British. Some of the
men reached the plantation of a Mr.
Robert Gibbes at night, and after kill
ing the cattl and shooting down the
negroes proceeded to shell the house.
Mr. Gibbes was unfortunatery a help
less cripple, but his eldest daughter, a
girl of 13. with the help of the servants,
carried him and a younger si to a
place of safety.
After doing this, she discovered that
the baby, a boy 2 years of age, had
been left behind. By this time, how
ever, the house was in flames, shells
were failing thick around ". and the
field was full of soldiers. Still she de
termined to save the baby and ran
toward the house, but was caught by
a soldier. "Where are you going?" he
demand d, and when she replied, "For
our baby," the soldiers stopped firing.
When she entered the house Its de
struction was so far completed that the
walls began to crumble and the flames
shot up through the roof. It is said
that when she reappeared a moment
later with a white bundle in her arms,
the soldiers cheered her loudly as she
ran to the spot where her father had
been placed. The heroic prlrl was badly
burned, but she recovered; while the
baby whose life she had thus saved
afterward became the gallant Lieu
tenant-Colonel Penwick.
"When Columbus discovered South Amer
ica, near the mouth of the Orinoco, the
Spaniards found an Indian villape built
over the water on piles. As it reminded
them of Venice, they called it Venezuela,
or "Little Venice."
HOW TO SUCCEED
AS AN INVENTOR
Dogged Perseverance Is the First
Requirement, Then Keep Your
Mind Free and Active in Your
Particular Field.
BY THOMAS A. EDISON.
F you want a recipe for how to sue-
Iceed as an inventor I can give it
to you in a very few words, and it
will do for any other business in
which you might wish to engage.
First, find out if there is a real need
for the thing which you wan* to in
vent. Then start in thinking about it.
Get up at 6 o'clock the first morning
and work until 2 o'clock the next morn
ing. Keep on doing this until some
thing in your line develops itself. If
it don't do so pretty soon, you had bet
ter shorten your sleeping hours and
work a little harder while you are
awake. If you follow that rule, you
can succeed as an inventor, or as any
thing else, for that matter. It was the
following of just such a rule that led
to the invention of the electric light,
the phonograph and the kinetoscope.
I believe that any person, even of the
most limited capacity, could become an
inventor by sheer hard work. You can
do almost anything if you keep at it
long enough. Of course, the man with
a natural aptitude would get there
first, but the other plodder would
eventually gain his point. The con
stant brooding on the one thing is sure
to develop new ideas concerning it,
and these, in their turn, suggest others,
and soon the completed idea stands
out before you. Above all things a man
must not give up, once he has out
lined his plan of action. A ball roll
ing down hill is sure to reach the bot
tom ultimately, no matter how many
obstacles stand in the way. It is this
principle which finally levels moun
tains. So, once fairly on your way,
don't stop because of some seemingly
impassable obstacle in front of you.
What you want may be just beyond
your nose, though you do not see it.
I once had that fact forcibly pre
sented to me. I was working^on an in
vention and finally reached a point
when I could go no further. The thing
lacked something, but, try as I might,
I could not tell what it was. Finally I
got angry at it and threw the whole
business out of the window. After
ward I thought how foolish the action
was and I went out and gathered up
the wreck. In putting it together again
I saw just what was needed. Repair
ing the broken portions suggested it,
and it was so simple that I wondered
I had not seen it before. Now that lit
tle addition to the apparatus could
have been ascertained by a little
thoughtful experimentation. I suppose
I found it out quicker because of the
"accident," but that does not alter the
moral of the incident.
How do I go about inventing- a con
trivance? Well, that is hard to say.
Everything requires different treat
ment. First, as 1 said, I find out if
there is a real need for the thing. Then
I go at it and attack it in every way I
can think out. This multiplied attack
soon simmers down, until I get what
might be called a composite idea â
something which is a combination of
all I have thought before, or else the
one feasible idea which really seems to
discount all the rest. Having once got
started on what I think is the right
track I keep up the pace until the goal
is reached.
The only thing, therefore, I can say
to the young inventor is to go and do
likewise. There is one piece of advice
I can giw, however. When a man
starts in to invent let him do so with
his mind free from all knowledge of
what' has been done already in the par
ticular field he is investigating.
For instance, if I am about to work
out something- I never read up on it,
nor do I inquire what has been done on
it by other inventors. Knowledge of
this kind is almost certain to prove a
snag in the path of the inventor. He
gets, into the rut made by his prede
cessors and stops off where they have
stopped. On the other hand, if he goes
in a direction of his own. there are no
ruts ahead of him: nothing, in fact, to
obstruct his progress. I have several
times made inventions in *his manner;
then when I had completed them I have
read up on the subject. I found my
own ideas were entirely original, but at
the same time the ideas of the other
fellows were so good U" to a certain
point that I should have been tempted
to have followed in their footsteps if I
had done any previous reading up.
Of course the question of natural ap
titude enters into the matter, and with
out it no man can become a star;
nevertheless, it is an auxiliary attain
ment; dogged perseverance is really the
quality most to be desired. Dogged
perseverance is the keystone of success.
In the arts, such as painting, music,
poetry and so forth, a very special tem
perament may be required, but in the
workshop of science men of the san
guine, "sandy' kind come out ahead.
The man who keeps at one thing and
never minds the clock is always sure to
do something. He may miss many so
cial engagements, of course, but hia
success is assured.
What line of invention is most profit
able?
That depends on what is meant by
the term "profitable." If an invention
is of great public utility it is seldom
personally profitable to the inventor.
If, on the other hand, it is a money
maker for the inventor, then the ben
efit to the general public is apt to be
limited. This is the fault of our mod
ern patent office practice. Inventors
are afraid to engage in large opera
tions which would have to be pro
tected by patents, because our laws, as
they now stand, give every opportun
ity to sharks to go in and infringe the
riprhts of the legitimate owners, em
ploying eminent legal assistance mean
while to cause a stay in any lawsuits
instituted by the rightful inventor. I
have inveighed against this condition.
before now. It is a serious discour
agement to all great public inventions
and it is a point which should be heed
ed by all who intend bringing out any.
invention.
So, then, as things stand, if a man
wishes to make money from his inven
tions, he had better devise some little
thin-g that costs but a trifle to man
ufacture. He will be sure to get
fleeced if he does not. Then, when ha
brings the contrivance before the pub
lic, let him steer clear of the patent of
fice, but manipulate the sale of his ar
ticle so that no one can compete with
him. His "trade secret," as it is called,
will be more valuable to him than any
patent office papers, and it will cost
him nothing to produce it.
After all, however, I suppose the real
Simon Pure inventor is not apt to be a
shrewd business man, and therefore the
thing he wants to know principally is
how to lay down any absolute rule.
The history of great inventions shows
that accident has been responsible for
many initial ideas. This, however, is
not always the case, nor should it be
so. Given a small amount of aptitude
and a large amount of application, any
man can enter the business of invent
ing and make a living â scant at first,
but mo-re lucrative as he goes along.
Thore are not many who realize what
this "large amount of application"
really means; the getting up very
early, the staying up very late and the
sticking at it. meanwhile, with a vim
that never can recognize failure. Men
of this kind fire sure to succeed.
Probably mi'lions of persons are dab
bling to-day in mechanical invention
of some nature, but the most of It is
too- spasmodic to count for much in the
long run. They do not keep at it
enough. If a business man were to
noelect the routine end of his daily
T .vnrk, if he were to pn to his office one
day or two days in the week and then
put the r^st off until next Monday, or
until some other time when the spirit
moved him, he would soon have to as-
sign.
It is just so with invention. You
have to pursue It as a business, and
even more steadily than the ordinary
business.
OLD GLORY OVER
The
BLUE AND THE GRAY
A PERSONAL friend told me the
following incident as a part of
the experience of a search party
over ground which had beÂ«n
fought over three times during
three of the six days in the Wilderness.
"For three days we were fighting all
the time," he said, "now up and now
down, till toward the third evening a
lot of us were detailed to go over a mis
erable excuse for a farm where the
struggle had been the hardest, to Bee If 1
there were any wounded men left unÂ«
cared for.
"As we came out of a strip of woods,
where the leaves and broken limbs of
trees covered the ground almost from,
sight, we were close to the blackened
remains of a house, and a little way on,
to our left we saw two pairs of up
turned feet in a deserted cattle shed. In.
a moment we stood looking into the
faces of a dead Confederate and a dy
ing Union soldier lying side by side, the
cold hand in gray scarcely colder than
the one in blue which held it, and, cov
ering both, was the strangest Old Glory
ever made.
"The living eyes were wistfully raised
to mine, and I read in the trembling of
the chin a feeble attempt to speak. We
gave him brandy, soaked bits of hard
tack in more and gradually fed him.
The stamp of death was upon his face
and its chill was creeping toward his
heart. I knelt and put my ear close to
his lips.
" 'This is my friend, now,' he whis
pered. 'No more Johnny Reb, but true
Old Glory manâ same as you and me.
Put us in same graye â side by side, and
this flag over our faces.'
"Noticing my look of inquiry fixed
upon the flag, he continued in. half
breaths and with many a halt that
might mean death:
" "We were hit almost alike â and sure
to die. Got in here and waited. Next
day a Reb, wounded in the neck, gave
us water. 'Nother day â and nobody
came. Johnny said, 'It's all up with,
both of us, comrade â an' I reckon taps
has sounded for me. Don't you think
I might be buried vith you, under the
Union flag â if only we had one? My
father fought for it in Mexico. Sayâ
can't we make one? I've these for
stars.' And he showed some brass caps,
such as they used to cover screws in,
bedsteads once. 'And there's that roll
of bandages we found in here. Your
blood an' mine will make the red
stripes â '
" ' 'And my blouse will make the
blue field,' I said, 'and I've a needle and
thread.'
" ' 'Where's your hand. Union?' he
said.
" ' 'S â o. Guess I'm off â but you'll
make the flagâ and â and â maybe when
Gabriel blows his horn and the dead
come out of their graves â you'll let me
keep hold of your hand, and you'll say,
'This is my friend. Lord. We fought
each other once, but we lay in one
grave under Old Glory. You know Old
Glory, Lord. And please forgive our
sins â especially Johnny's.' '
" 'And so I made the flag â an' him a
lying dead beside me â not fine, as you
seeâ but Old Glory all the same. You'll
put it over our faces when you bury us
side by side, won't you, comrades? â an*
me a-holding his hand."
"And his look of happiness as we all
said 'Yea' changed Instantly to the
peace of death.

ROUNDING UP OUTLAWS
IN THE COLORADO BASIN
Active Campaign By the Governors of
Four States Against "Butch"
Cassidy and His 500
Freebooters.
SALT LAKE, Utah, March 29.
IS9B.â "Butch" Cassldy is a bad
man. He is the worst man in
four States. These States are
Utah, Colorado, Idaho and Wy-
oming, and when the four Governors
met in secret conclave on Monday it
â was far the purpose of deciding upon
a plan of campaign against the most
notorious outlaw the West has ev*r
had to cope with. The achievements of
Jesse James and his followers pale into
tawdry insignr ance before those of
"Butch" Cassidy and his five hundred.
For several yearsâ in fact, ever since
the Live Stock Commission drove the
Wyoming rustlers out of business in
jS92 â "Butch" his proven a thorn in the
flesh of Lfle authorities of the four
States in which carries on his oper
ations. He has laughed the militia to
Bcorn. Sheriffs and deputies he regards
with pity an 1 contempt. He is a pow
er unto himself.
After the ordinary methods of hunt
ing outlaws had been tried unsuccess
fully it was decided that drastic means
must be employed. Rewards have been
repeatedly offered for "Butch" Cassidy,
dead or live, and after each fresh out
break these rewards have invariably
been increased. If all the offers which
have been made from time to time hold
good, the slayer of "Butch " should he
ever live to claim his reward, would be
entitled to upward of $20,000 in blood
money.
But the rewards have proven as fu
tile as have the efforts of the militia
and the deputy sheriffs. And that is
why Governor Wells of Utah, Governor
Adams of Colorado, Governor Richards
of Wyoming and Governor Steunen
berg of Idaho <"ot their heads together
to see what could be done. Just what
the result of thoir conference was has
not been divulged.
The Governors believe in still hunt
methods, and it is thought that a large
number of experienced mountaineers
and bandit hunters will be placed in
the field, each State to furnish its quo
ta, and that the bandits will be round
ed up in much the same fashion that
cattle are. Any attempt to exterminate
this desperate band is certain to be at
tended by bloodshed.
"Butch" and his band are the out
growth of the rustlers of six years ago.
Since then they have broadened their
field and increased their numbers. It
is no idle boast to say that the leader of
this notorious band has five hundred
men at his beck and call.
Their depredations are upon a scale
never before reached in the history of
frontier crime. All the conditions are
favorable to them. They know every
foot of the vast terâ itory in which they
operate, taking in, as it does, the wild
est and most inaccessible portions of
four States. Every man oÂ£ them is
thoroughly familiar with frontier life
In its rougher phases.
The forces are subdivided into five

Power Springs and Robber's Roostâ Are Indicated on the Map.
bands, each controlled by its own lead
er, with Oassidy as the supreme power.
The outlaws now practically control
the sparsely settled region extending
fmm Central Wyoming southwesterly
through Northwestern Colorado and
Utah, and almost to the Arizona line.
Marauding and murderous bands con
duct their raids without restraint. The
thefts of livestock run into the mil
lions. Ranchmen are murdered and
driven out of business, and the officers
of the law are powerless.
There are five camps where the
various bands make their headquar
ters, each of which is well nigh inacces
sible except to the bandits themselves.
Two of the most famous are "Robbers'
Roost" and "Hole in the Wall." The
former is in South Central Utah on the
San Rafaele River, a few miles west of
the Green River. The latter is hidden
away somewhere in that wild, moun
tainous district to the northwest of
Casper, Wyo.
The other camps are located in Teton
Basin, near the eastern border of
Idaho and south of the Snake River;
Powder Springs in Southwestern Wyo
ming, near Colorado, and about fifty
miles east of the Utah line; and Browns
Park, taking in the northwestern cor
ner of Colorado and the northeastern
portion of Utah. It is not definitely
known in just which State the Browns
Park camp lies, but it is thought to be
across the line in Colorado. .
Never before in the record of border
outlawry na.ve Western States bee.i
forced to form an offensive and defen
sive alliance against bandits such as
was entered into last week at Salt Lake
by the Governors of these four States.
The situation had become desperate
and a desperate remedy was required.
The five camps form a chain extend
ing for hundreds of miles. Between
these posts communication is main
tained by a regular system of couriers
and cipher dispatches, facilitating the
co-operation of two or more bands
when an enterprise of more than usual
magnitude is undertaken.
Thef=e reckless bands are composed of
men of the most reckless and desperate
character, long accustomed to deeds of
crime. Whenever a murder is com
mitted in the mountain States or a con
vict escapes from a penitentiary the
criminal flees to the nearest of these
retreats, where hVis safe from pursuit.
In this manner the ranks of the ban
dits have been recruited up to a
strength conservatively estimated at
five hundred. While each band has its
chosen leader, "Butch" Cassidy exer
cises some sort of authority over the
federation.
Each of the strongholds is both a ren
dezvous and a fortress absolutely im
pregnable. They can only be reached
by traversing deep and narrow gorges,
scaling lofty and rugged peaks and
penetrating the wildest recesses of the
Rocky Mountains. In many places the
only trail lies over a narrow shelf or
a precipice. Holes have been drilled,
into which in case of close pursuit dy
namite can be placed and the trail
blown from the face of the cliff into
the chasm below, thus baffling all pur
suers.
There are also many places where one
robber can hold fifty officers at bay,

and as the bandits are armed to the
teeth and will light to the last man.
any effort to exterminate them by the
ordinary processes of law is regarded
as a useless Sacrifice of life. In their
retreats are numerous caves, luxur
iously fitted up and containing subsis
tence sufficient for months. Thus are
the bandits enabled to set at defiancs
all the forces of law and order.
The outlaws roam the adjacent coun
try and smaller settlements without
molestation. Many settlers purchase
immunity by extending assistance in
various ways, and the robbers even ai
tend country dances and other func
tions, occasionally "shooting up" the
town or indulging in other forms of re
creation. It is only when close!-'- pur
sued by officers of the law that they ra
tlre to their mountain retreats.
"Butch" Cassidy, however, by reason
of the price upon his head, consider*
the higher altitude more conducive \o
his health and seldom ventures into
the towns, unless he is making a raid
or is surrounded by a band of his trusty
men, in which case he never fears mo
lestation. As a killer he has earned a
reputation during the last ten years
probably equaled in the West only by
that of "Wild iiill" Hickok, peace to his
ashes.
Few men who know him would carÂ«
to rouse his ire, for althoueh a man of
wonderful nerve, unlike most of his
class, he is possessed of a fearful tem
per. Sometimes it gets beyond, his
control, and then he throws all cau
tion to the wind and becomes utterly
reckless.
About four years ago he was shot at
from ambush near Green River by a
cowboy known as "Hackey" Hughes,
whose only object was to secure the
reward offered by the State authorities
of Utah. lhe bullet pierced the lobe
of his ear, and the blood streaming
down his face acted upon Cassidy as a
red flag might to a maddenea bull.
With a howl of rage he turned his
horse just as another bullet passed
through the rim of his sombrero. A
puff of smoke from a clump of bushes
showed where the assassin was con
cealed. For picturesque profanity
"Butch" Cassidy hasn't his equal in
the States, and on that occasion he is
said to have fairly surpassed himself.
Ripping out a string of oaths that
would reach from Dan to Beersheba he
jumped from his horse and dodged be
hind a bowlder.
He waited for twenty minutes, and
then the cowboy shot the outlaw's
horse, which had been grazing in the
open. That was more than "Butch"
could stand. Throwing caution to the
winds he ran toward the clump of
bushes, with a pistol in each hand
barking at every step.
But Hughes, considering discretion
the better part of valor, had jumped on
his horse and succeeded in making
good his escape. But the vindictive
nature of "Butch" Cassidy asserted it
self. He had recognized his assailant,
and every member of the band re
ceived instructions to be on the watch
for him. Hughes left the Green River
country, and it was not until six
months later that he was located, on
the north fork of the Powder River up
in Wyoming.
Cassidy was notified, and with a
dozen picked men he reached the ranch
where Hughes was working. It was
during the spring roundup. The two
men met face to face. Hughes knew
what was coming and pulled his gun.
But he wasn't quick enough. Cassidy's
pistol cracked first, and the cowb'o>
dropped from his saddle with a bullet
through his right eye.
"That's the way I serve any
skunk that tries to shoot me in the
back." remarked Cassidy. "If any of
his friends want t take up the quar
rel I'm ready."
But if the dead cowboy had any
friends they failed to respond. "Butch"
Cassidy was well known, and it wasn't
safe to pick quarrels with him. So he
rode away with his escort, cursing the
cowboys for a pack of cowardly coyotes
Cattle-stealing is the chief source of
income to Cassidy and his fdlowers
One company alone in Central Utah
has lost 2000 head during the past two
years, worth at present prices $80 000
These were driven through Colorado
and into New Mexico. It is in driving
these stolen cattle from one State to
another and out of the cou.itry that
their system of co-operation is benefi
cial.
However, any operation that prom
ises adventure and financial reward is
never overlooked. Trains are held up
express companies and banks are
robbed, and even individuals, when
known to have money in their posses
sion, are relieved of their possessions
in true road-agent style.
There are women among these out
laws, too, who ride with them on their
Avild forays and take pride in their as
sociation with these bold and daring
freebooters. Even "Calamity Jane " in
the old days of her association with
"Deadwood Dick." cotild not surpass
these picturesque females in their wild
career.
About a year ago "Butch" Cassidy
and "Bill" Ferguson, one of his trusted
lieutenants, dashed into the town of
Price in broad daylight, held up the
paymaster of the coal company and
rode off with $8000 before the crowd of
bystanders realized what had hap
pened. This is but a sample exploit.
Bank robberies are but side issues
â¢with them; merely incidental to their
grand chief occupation of cattle-steal
ing. If a victim resists or an officer
pursues murder is regarded as a pro
fessional duty, to be cheerfully per
formed, but they are not given to
wanton slaughter. In several instances
foolhardy officers who have invaded
their strongholds have been disarmed,
dismounted and sent home.
An instance of this kind occurred just
after the raid on the coal company at
Price. Two deputies traced Cassidy
and Ferguson to the lair at "Robbers'
Roost. ' They were fully twenty-four
hours behind, and their approach was
known long before they arrived at the
narrow trail leading up into the ren
dezvous. Cassidy was in a jovial mood,
and he conceived that it would be more
fun to capture the deputies and make
sport of them than to kill them. So he
acted accordingly.
The deputies were about half way up
the trail when, just at a bend around
a sharp noint of rocks, they heard the
shar.> co.nmand "Hands up!"
Half a dozen -uns were staring- them
in the face not twenty paces away. The
deputies realized that not to obey
meant sudden death. Up went their
hands. Cassidy stepped up to them,
roaring with laughter.
"You're a couple of fine dubs to come
and catch peaceable citizens, ain't
you?" he cried. "Gimme your guns.
Here, Buck," calling to one of his men
"search these tenderfeet, and if they've
got any tobacco you can keep it."
The outcome of it was that the depu
ties, relieved of everything but tjieir
clothing, were bound hand and foot to
their horses, conducted to the foot of
the pasÂ» and sent about their business.
To add to their discomfiture a rudely
scrawled note was pinned on the breast
of each, which read:
WE ARE r>ETTTT SHERIFFS,
Sent Out to Capture Butch Cainidy and
His Gang. When 'Found Send Us Home.
WOMEN POLAR EXPLORERS.
THE no-table achievements of
women are not confined to the
temperate zones. It is well known
that in 1S&1 Mrs. Peary accom-
panied her husband to McCor
mlck Bay, on the northwestern coast of
Greenland, where she wintered with
him at "Red Cliff House" (built by the
expedition), in 77 degrees 43 minutes
north latitude, and that last summer
she and her little daughter, Marie
Peary, approached still nearer to the
north pole, reaching Cape Sabine on
the Hope. This is the fatal spot from
which General Greely was rescued,
after the death of nineteen comrades,
and is 78 degrees north, within 6 de
grees of the "farthest north" on land,
that of Lockwood and Brainard in ISB2.
Mrs. Peary does not stand alone in
her achievements. Though her record
is spc-ken of as being unique, there are
two women, long since dead, who have
more than equaled her record.
In July, 1735, there sailed from Ir
kutsk, Siberia, down the Lena River,
into the Arctic seas, an expedition
commanded by a Russian, Lieutenant
Pronchistshef. He was in search of the
"northeast passage." On board the
ship was his bride, who, rather than be
separated rrom the man she had jusc
â wedded, cheerfully braved the penis â
more v rt >,ue and terrible then â of the
m.-rth, at his side.
The old records state that the ship
managed, despite the ice, to pass
through the most eastern mouth of the
Lena, and then sailed northwesterly
along the coast, in a passage between
the ice, not more than 100 or 200 yards
wide, almost reaching Cape Chelyuskin,
the northernmost land in Siberia; but
here they were stopped by ice, and here
they were forced to winter in latitude
77 degrees 4S minutes north. In order
to fully appreciate what- it meant for
a woman to do this, it must be remem
bered that in 1735 great ignorance pre
vailed as to the conditions of Arctic
life. The equipments of the Arctic ex
peditions on the miserable little sail
ing vessels, often hardly fit even to
sleep upon, were extremely meager and
could in no way bear comparison with
the carefully fitted up ships sent north
in this century.
The party of Pronchistshef lived
through the winter, suffering from
many fearful privations, and in the
spring they broke loose from the ice
and headed the ship back. And here,
near the mouth of the river Olenek, on
this homeward voyage, the courageous
little bride died. Her death was fol
lowed in two days by that of her brave
husband. Lieutenant Pronchistshef.
Thus ended the first Arctic romance.
This exploit remained unparalleled
for over a hundred years when Mine.
d'Aunet. in 1539, visited the island of
Spitzbergen, on board the ship La Re
cherche, sent out by France, and com
manded Hy Captain Fabvre. There waa
also on board a committee of scientists,
who accomplished much valuable work.
La Recherche sailed to Magdalena Bay,
Spitzbergen, which is "9 degrees 35 min
utes north, two degrees farther north
than Mrs. Pronchistshef and one and
a half farther than Mrs. Peary. Mme.
d'Aunet, on her safe return home, de
scribes the , cemetery of fishers in Mag
dalena Bay, the men who lost their
lives on that bleak coast. It is the
farthest north of any burying ground
in the world.
"I counted fifty-two graves In this
cemetery," she says, "which is the most
forbidding in the wide world; a ceme
tery without epitaphs, without monu
ments, without flowers, without remem
brances, without tears, without regrets,
without prayers; a cemetery of desola
tion, where oblivion doubly environs
the dead, where is heard no sigh, no
voice, no human step; a terrifying soli
tude, a profound and frigid silence,
broken only by the fierce growl of the
polar bear or the moaning of the
storm."
AN AMATEUR BAKER.
There is a woman now in New York
who has had most serious misfortunes,
and yet, in her grief and helplessness,
has shown rare perseverance and ener
gy at the critical moment.
Only a few weeks ago she and her
husband lived in a comfortable home in
a western city. They owned the prop
erty and had been moderately well to
do. But the husband died very sud
denly. Then the insurance on the house
ran out, and soon the widow found It
necessary to dispose of the property.
Pending- the negotiations, the house
burned to the ground, and although the
widow escaped, everything in her pos
session had been consumed. She had
to borrow clothes before leaving for
New York, where she had friends.
She resolved not to allow her grief
to have a serious effect upon her, but
to find some immediate source of sup
port, and took the first opportunity that
offered. She had made a specially
wholesome graham bread fo.r a friend
here who was suffering with indiges
tion, and his appreciation of it at once
suggested a means of supportâ she
would bake and sell bread. Calling at
neighboring residences and boarding
houses, she at once took orders for all
she could bake, delivered the bread tho
same day, and secured regular custo
mers. With the proceeds of successive
sales she took in a large supply of ma
terials, and is steadily increasing the
profits. She declares that with her
ambition she will not remain poor long,
and will soon make a big success of her
undertaking.
CANNOT MARRY IN
KOREA AT PRESENT
Odd Law That Forbids Marriages Till
the King Is Wedded, so Aff Good
Koreans Are Patiently
Waiting.
LL Koreans are overjoyed at the
assurance that their King is go-
I J ing to be married again at an
f\ early date. Legally, there has
I been no marriage in Korea since
/ the Queen's murder two years
ago. The King's marriage means a
great deal to the people of marriage
able age, for if the King be single, the
law says that no marriage may take
place in the land till he marries. The
King takes precedence in matters mat
rimonial and all good Koreans who
abide by the letter of the law religious
ly and patriotically postpone their wed
ding days till the King officially greets
his royal spouse.
The strict letter of this law is not de
voutly observed throughout all classes
of Korea, The common people do pretty
much as they please in the matter, for
the authorities realizing the antag
onism it would raise, do not prosecute
them if they marry.
Among the better classes and the no
bility, though, no one thinks of marry
ing. To do so means instant loss of
caste. The Korean four hundred will
never open its doors to people who have
married while the King was single.
As marriages in Korea are arrange
ments in which personal inclinations
never play any part, it is not so- diffi
cult to refrain from marrying. The
Korean never falls in love. It is not
considered the proper thing to do. All
necessary arrangements are made by
the two families who wish their chil
dren to intermarry. The two people
most interested are never consulted at
all.
Since the murder of the Queen none
of the members of good families have
married. But the people have long been
impatient for the King to marry, so
that it might be permissible for them
to follow his example.
Over a year ago they began to ex
press their discontent openly The
King's advisers pleaded with him then
and pointed out to him that unless he
married, serious consequences might re-
The King looked about him for a
wife, and. forgetful of his three-score
years, hit upon a maiden of noble fam
ily not yet sixteen years old.
His Ministers frowned upon his choice
and used every effort to dissuade him
The King for some time declared that
he would marry the girl despite their
advice to the contrary, but the Minis*
ters finally succeeded in convincing him
that it would be folly. For the Koreans
would rather that their Xi z. should re
main single forever than that he should
so far forget time-honored customs as
to marry a girl so much his junior.
The Koreans, like the Chinese and
Japanese, do not countenance mar
riages when there is a great disparity
in the ages. The sunbeam kisses not
the moonbeam they say.
Although the King was willing to
give up the maiden of his choice, he re
fused for a long time to consider any of
the other damsels that wereoffered him
by his advisers. Of late the clamorings
of the people for the remarriage of their
Kinc have grown so persistent that he
has yielded to the importunities of his
Ministers and has agreed to marry the
lady they 'nave selected for him.
The future Korean Queen is said to
be about thirty years oid and very
handsome, according to the oriental
standard of beauty. In this she differs
from her predecessor, who was an ex
ceedingly plain-looking woman. In ad
dition, the future Queen is simply as
intelligent, or rather, as unintelligent,
as her countrywomen, while the mur
dered Queen was considered clever, and
was remarkably well informed consid
ering her advantages. Her influence
over the King was supreme, and he
consulted her on all matters of public
as well as private interest. Her judg
ment swayed all his actions and her
power was evident in every branch of
the Government.
In selecting this wife for the.Kincr th 9
Ministers have been very careful to
choose one who will not usurp their
power.
During the twenty-five years that the
murdered Queen shared the throne â¢>Â£
Korea, she practically ruled the nation.
Like other Korean girls, she received
little or no education, but she was a
constant and serious student. She read
all tho books that could be obtained
at the English mission schools and was
aware that there were nations far more
advanced than the Koreans. Never
theless she had that inborn hatred for
the Japanese which is the birthright of
every Korean, and for this reason there
are some who believe she was put out
of the way by a Japanese.
National Korean dislike for the Jap
anese dates back 400 years. A mijrhty
Japanese warrior, living at that time,
with but a handful of men succeeded
in conquering as large an army as K<->
rea could muster. Of this feat of
arms the Japanese are proud and in
their text books the warrior who ac
complished it is given the place of
honor. The Koreans have never for
gotten the ignominy of the defeat and
have a deep-rooted aversion for every
thing Japanese. All their customs and
laws more clearly resemble the Chi
nese to whom they are veFy partial.
The murdered Queen did not hide her
dislike for the Japanese, for in spite
of the knowledge she had acquired, she
was still a Korean, and as such could
not tolerate the. Japanese The Minis
ter from Japan was subjected to all
manner of indignities. Her family,
who were all-powerful in Korea, owing
to her influence with the King, made
thiners particularly uncomfortable fo..
the Japanese located in Korea.
One night some one entered the
apartments of the Queen by stealth and
murdered her. It was claimed that the
murderer %vas a Japanese. An Amer
ican living in the capital confirmed this
report. He had seen the Japanese slip
into the royal house and come out with
stains of blood on his garments.
The Koreans asserted that the p^sas
sin was but the instrument of the Jap
anese Minister in Korea, and that the
murder had been done at his instiga
tion. Japan finally recalled the Min
ister and sent another in his place, thus
averting serious trouble.
The King, now that his wife is dead,
is easily managed by his Ministers. The
murdered Queen's family have been
stripped of their power, and have
sought refuge in China.
The new Queen will not occupy the
prominent position of affairs that her
predecessor did. The people do not
care what manner of woman the Kin?
marries, so long as she is of a suita
ble age. But what they do wq.nt Is
that he shall marry at once, so that
marriage may again be strictly legal In
Korea-RECRUITING MEN
FOR THE NAVY
Every-Day Scene in the Office Where All
Sorts of Men Are Volunteering for
Service on Uncle Sam's
New Battle-Ships.
AN hour at the naval recruiting
rendezvous down near the
water front is very interesting
just now.
This naval recruiting rendez
vous at California and Market
streets is quite typical of the many
places Jotting the American shore
line where the brawn and heart
and courage that must be the nation's
main reliance in any hour of struggle
that may come, is being given greater
volume. The good Annapolis and New
port braineries have finished their out
put of gallant order-givers and now
the recruiting: station looms up as the
nation's chief further reliance for fight
ing men.
It was easy enough to enter this por
tal of the naval service opened a few
days ago an telegraphic orders from
Washington. Up a dirty stairway,
past the big poster, "Wanted, for the
navy of the United States," etc., a turn
past a dozen or more men conversing
In the hallway, doubtful, willing or
eager about enlisting, and then ' the
welcoming sign "Enter without knock
ing." Easy enough it is to go in to
â  Uncle Sam and say: "Here I am, old
. man."
But if you have any pondering to do
before you sign those momentous iron
clad "articles of agreement," do the
pondering before you pass that invit
ing sign. Ponder as you walk the
streets penniless, my unlucky American
. friend, ponder the step at home or by
. your forge or among your fellows, my
' patriotic fellow citizen, and pause to
think it over again, as 1 found Jack
Kelso doing before that ilaming^oster
at the head of the stairs, but when you
. pass that door Uncle Sam won't sit
down and ponder the step cut with you.
You will earn a day's pay in the navy
or be out in the streets a gentleman
of peace in a very few minutes.
I went in with Jack Kelso, whose ac
quaintance I made before the big pos
ter. He was a slim, smooth-faced lad
of 23, with soft, rosy cheeks and a
light-hearted joke for everybody every
minute. He'll be the life of some steel
built forecastle and his mates will
warm to Jack. V- '
In the big bare reception room eight
men who had gone in a minute or two
before sat silently with hats respect
fully off, on two long benches that by
their folding iron legs and messroom
design were the sole symbols of the
Bait sea there, except for a few queer
iy knotted cords and cables in a cor
ner.
"Sit down a minute," said busy War
rant Officer Barr, and then from the
tarpeted front room there burst forth
a large, well-fed man with a kindly eye
and brisk voice and manner. Lieu
tenant George M. Btoney, in command
of the station, strode toward the door
of the medical examiner's room and ha
paused a moment for a sweeping glance
at the volunteers.
: "Here, you're too small, sir," and the
lieutenant had disposed of the wiry, lit
tle bit of a fellow at the end of a bench
and without a solitary word the poor
little fellow put on his hat and shot
out into the world with so quick an
ending to his ambition to battle with
'. Spain. That crisis in the little fellow's
life was over.
.'â¢. "And what do you want to enlist
â  for?" asked the lieutenant, quickly, of
a swarthy little fellow by the door.
: He wanted to go as a seaman.
: ."Where were you born?"
â¢ "I was born In New Orleans, but I
.was" raised in France, sir," said the
curly headed little fellow, cowering a
trifle. Â»
â¢ â¢ "H'm! How can you prove that you
â¢were born in New Orleans?" asked
Lieutenant Stoney with a searching,
quizzical squint that helped emphasize
the glorious fact that no man but an
American citizen by birth or adoption
can get into the American navy these
days. â¢
. The little fellow was passed for ex
amination by the luck of a moment's
quick decision and Jack Kelso stood
up, clear eyed and strong limbed, to
answer boldly and cheerfully, "I want
to go as a coal passer."
"Born in this country?"
"Born and raised in San Francisco."
â¢: That was enough to pass Jack to the
medical examination that is the only
one required for coal passers.
"Send this man in, Mr. Barr," and
Jack went in to strip to the skin and
!â â¢â¢ weighed, measured and thumped, to
show his teeth, read letters across the
room, name colors and let the surgeon
record every identifying mark and cer
tify that he was up to the unrelenting
Btandard of almust perfect physical
manhood that measures every last man
that rides the pea for Uncle Sam.
"Here, Peters, the doctor passes you.
Let's see what you know," said Officer
Barr to a waiting candidate for a sea
man's berth. "What's a topgallant
m'st?" "What's the opposite of east
by south?" A minute of such ques
tioning and then Peters sat down and
reeved a purchase and tied strange
knots that bind where the salt spray
flles and then he picked up a marlin
ppike and spliced two cable ends with
a mastery that backed up his account
of his sea experience.
Three minutes is enough for a sea
man to prove his seamanship to a sea
man, and then Peters in 1898 was not
enlisting for a frigate under Captain
Hull and a seaman's examination isn't
what it us?d to be when the engine
mom was aloft and when stray zephyrs
gave guns their quarry.
The clerk had a bunch of papers
ready and six waiting men who had
been passed were summoned to a table.
The decisive moment has come for you,
lads. There's a minute yet in which
to retreat.
"Here, Murphy, we haven't got the?
name of a relative in your record yet."
said the clerk to a brawny fellow with
an unshaven face and seedy clothes.
"I haven't got any relatives I can
give, sir."
'Well, give the name of some friend.
We've got to have somebody to send
your dead body to in case you die, you
see," was the kind and cheerfully mat
ter-of-fact explanation to Murphy.
The long articles of agreement were
perfunctorily read to each man in turn,
a dreary job to the clerk, and there
was a reverent seriousness in the atti
tude of each raw recruit as he listened
to the hard and fast covenant with Un
cle Sam which includes section 1422 of
the Revised Statutes.
"Now put your name here. Murphy,"
and "Daniel Murphy" is laboriously in
scribed on a blank line in a big six
page document.
"And now here in this book. And
now in this book."
"I didn't get that quite on the line,"
says Murphy, apologetically, as the job
ended in the register so full of ruled
columns.
"That's all right, Murphy. You be
long to Uncle Sam now and you've got
a day's pay coming to you," says the
good-natured clerk. "Be here at 3
o'clock to go to Mare Island."
And so a bunch of six more defenders
were added to Uncle Sam's force and
so the rapid, decisive routine of ac
ceptance and rejectment of men went
on through the day.
"They're coming in faster than we
con take care of them," explains Officer
Barr in a moment of leisure. "About
a hundred a day com > in and we accept
about twenty-five."
Seamen and coal passers are quickly
examined and accepted or rejected at
the rendezvous. The navy wants skilled
labor these days. It wants machinists,
bollermakers, blacksmiths, etc., for the
fighting machine of to-day is a big ma
chine shop, supplied with everything
but big shop machinery. And it wants
engineers and firemen as well as sea
men and coal heavers.
An engineer is at the rendezvous to
examine skilled laborers and when they
pass this and the rigid medical ex
amination they are sent to the shops
at Mare Island for another examina
tion by foremen and engineers there,
for Uncle Sam wants none not masters
of trades. Of course the skilled labor
enlisted is all for ships. The men in
the navy yard shops are merely hired
as civilians.
"He passed me qukk." said Jack
Kelso, jubilantly, twelve minutes after
he went into the surgeon. And in fif
teen minutes more Jack had made the
covenant with a jolly joke.
He sobered up and told why he went
into the navy.
"Now, I'm giving up a salary of Â»12 50
a week," he explained. "But I got tired
of San Francisco and just thought that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
a change in my life would be good for
me. I wouldn't have enlisted if it hadn't
been for the war talk, but I don't care
whether there's a fight or not. If I get
into one I'm willing to take my
chances. There's nothing the matter
with me and I haven't smo-ked or
drank in four years. My folks don't
want me to go and they say I'll get to
be a bum, but I guess I'll come out all
right."
There were boys like Jack in the
Maine, and there'll be anxious hearts
to follow Jack to sea from the Mission,
as anxious hearts all over this land
were with the boys on the Maine when
she moored in Havana harbor.
"Most of thes*e men going in ain't like
me," Jack continued. "I've talked with
fifty of them and they're going for all
sorts of reasons. Some say they want
to see a fight and some just go for the
excitement, but the most of them were
Just discouraged and on their uppers
more or less and want a chance for a
respectable living.
"I've talked with fellows that say
they've lost their grip somehow and
they think they can save their man
hood and sol f- respect and have a little
wad in three years by going into the
navy."
Jack was right. Amid all the motives
that bring the trooping recruits to the
naval rendezvous the chief one is un
doubtedly the new and better hold on
life that the service offers to men
weary of struggles with misfortune.
The long-used collars, the frayed hats
and the general appearance of many
who troop up those stairs are eloquent
of hard times.
AUCTIONING OFF JOBS
IN THE LABOR MARKET
IN the block on Clay street, which
is flanked by the thoroughfares of
Montgomery and Kearny. there are
a number of odd outposts of the
labor mart of San Francisco.
They call themselves labor bureaus,
and such they are, but in a wider sense
they are labor markets, the stalls to
which labor comes to barter itself to
capital, and where the bidding between
the two fixes the price for the com
modity of service in all branches
throughout the State of California.
For if the bid for labor here is high,
how long will men employed remain
at jobs which pay them less than the
rate here given? Straightway the door
of the labor emporium becomes
jammed with the dingily dressed toil
ers, and the jobs which they left go
upon the walls thereof calling for
hands at a higher wage.
Curious places are these, in number
half a dozen, perhaps, including one
bazar, which deals especially in the
Asiatic article, and about whose open
door the flat brown faces of the Japan
ese contrast with the rharp visages of
the Chinese in a different shade of
tan. A garnish of pawnshops, their
windows hung with cheap watches and
glittering with nickel-played pistols,
surround the labor joints, and the mo
notony of these is relieved by a sprink
ling of saloons and occasionally a ten
cent restaurant. These embellish
ments, divided by a narrow and very
dirty street, give character to the labor
market district.
There is especial and unusual activ
ity manifest at present in this region,
growing out of possibly the shaking up
which the labor conditions of the State
have had over the Alaska exodus. The
walls of the labor places are covered
with paper signs lettered in glaring red,
men surge in and out the crowded in
teriors and up and down through these
It will not be all coal-passing for
Jack Kelso. It will be "four hours on
and eight off" with him and plenty of
drill and other service, and in action
he would have his station and duty
when "off watch" below decks or at the
guns.
The little Sunol left for Mare Island
at 4 p. m., and twenty men were
marched fro-m the rendezvous to board
her, some within an hour after passing
examination. At the wharf a middle
aged little woman had a moment's
chance to give Jack Kelso a tearful
hug. Eighteen hours later Jack was
trigged out in his uniform on the re
ceiving shin at the navy yard and
lined up with an awkward squad in
front of the drill sergeant.
crowds go criers declaiming in loud
voices the jobs they have to offer and
calling upon those about them to accept
the same and go to work.
"Now I want five men to go to Marin
County." shouts one of these labor auc
tioneers. "Easy work, plowing between
vines. Here you get buttermilk, sweet
milk, butter on your bread; blankets at
night; fine climate; healthful work.
Sent off five this morning, want five
more to go on the boat to-night; who's
going? Now, boys, wake up, and go
to work. Here I want a cook for a coun
try hotel; wash his own dishes; twelve
regular boarders and forty at dinner;
must be an all-around cookâ no restau
rant cook. Soup, roast meats and pas
try. Who'll take that job?"
No one in the crowd responds. They
Baunter about reading the glaring signs
calling for men to cut fifteen thousand
redwood ties at 8 cents each, woodchop
pers at $1 25 per cord and other pla
cards of the stock sort â apparently, for
no one seems ever to accept the offers,
and they hang there and become dis
colored.
Beneath these sensationally drawn
advertisements are seated upon
benches an unbeautiful row of wall
flowers, smoking dirty pipes and look
ing demure. Occasionally a word of
denunciatory comment escapes them.
"Here!" says the crier, buttonholing
one of the most passe of these, "Why
don't you take this job? What can
you do? Can you milk a cow? Fifteen
dollars and found to milk cows: ten
cows, twelve cows, maybe fifteen
cows; who wants this job? Can't do
that? Thirty cents a day and grub to
carry a sign through the streets for a
restaurant; city Job: who'll take that?
I want a dishwasher: fifteen a month
and found. Ain't there a man in the
crowd who can wash dishes?" Still
no one responds; only smoking and si
l*neÂ» and scuffling of feet.
Then the crier looks straight ahead
as though staring into space, becomes
red in the face and shouts:
"What's the matter with you fel
lers? Don't you want work? Ain't you
here fcr business? That's what I'm
here for. Are you waiting for better
jobs and more wages, or ain't you got
your money spent yet?" Then the
Cicero grows pessimistic: "I tell you,
boys," he asserts, "I never saw the
outlook for work so bad as it is to-day.
You want farm work, eh? Well, where
are you going to get it? The grain crop
is gone; all down the San Joaquin
it won't pay to cut it. They ain't
had no rain, and only a little around
Sacramento will be saved. If you're
waitin' for the grain crop to carry you
out you'll starve first. Now, mayb?
you're waitin' for the fruit crop to
take you out. Well, that crop's gone,
too. Didn't you read the papers about
that big frost on last Monday ni-erht;
well, that killed all the apricots and al
monds. Look right there on the wall;
that's a bank in the city here wantin'
to let a contract to cut two thousand
cord of stove wood: it's apricots and
almonds; and they're cutting out an
orchard because the trees ain't profita
ble any more."
"That's so," interrupts a searred
faced man with a black mustache, "I
went up on a ranch last week to work
apricots and was let out with six oth
ers when the frost struck." Groans
from the crowds follow this statement
and a florid Celt with a voice in high
key declares the scarred-race is a
booster for the house. This is indig
nantly denied by the owner of the
scar, and the pipes of the auctioneer
start up again leaving the quarrel to
bevel down to subsistence in groans.
Presently the voice stops and the
hum of conversation which resumes
from the crowd indicates that the auc
tioneer has retired. He has disappear
ed, indeed, and I seek him in a sid*Â»
apartment, where he materializes at a
disheveled desk in the midst of a bevy
of laborers who have drained them
selves out of the company in the ad
jacent hall, and have come to apply
for some of the much praised jobs.
"You're a Swede milker," says the
Crier, now transformed into a bustling
man of business, as he looks down up
on the hands of the first man beside
him. A moon face, brushed on the top
by a whisp of yellow hair, breaks into
curving wrinkles at this remark, and
a strong Norse voice asks, "How you
know dat?"
"I tell by that knot on your right
thumb," says the man of business.
"You strip the teat with your thumb
when you milk. You want that milker
Job, don't you? Well, where did you
work last?" and so a formula of -ques
tions and answers are rehearsed, the
Swode pays $2 and is given the address
of the employer, with a letter of intro
duction from the house.
"And what do you ant?" asked the
swift man of the scowling young coun
tenance next beside him.
"Want that buggy-washing job," is
the reply made with a swagger of the
head and a scuffle of the foot.
"Are you a buggy-washer?"
â¢ "Yes.".
"Where did you ever wash buggies?"
"Smith & Mahoney's."
"How :do . you go about washing a
buggy?" ' . ... V '/: .7;;^
â â 'â  "Well," with another swagger and
scuff, ;"I jack up the axle,' take the
wheel off the box and see if it needs
greasin'." ;
"You won't do; take another job,"
and he passes to the next man.
"Why didn't you take that man who
wanted the buggy-washing job?" . I
aske . the hustler, ter he Lad gone
through the company with Z much .of
that expedition and success with which
a circus rider gets through a hoop. '
"Why didn't I take him? < Because
the man who wants to do the hiring in
that job is a crank. That fellow is an
American \ and he's bad \ tempered. He
wouldn't last with that crank two days. :
Besides, .ie didn't know his work; he's
never â¢ washed buggies, and there'd be
a row between them before they'd been
together, twenty-four hours. . ; I'll ' have
to put an easy-going German on that
job." â¢â -;- . :'<::â <
"How do you know he never washed
buggies?" I asked. â â¢â â ': :
"Because he didn't know how to start
the work.' In washing a buggy the first
thing you do is to take v out and dust
off the cushions : and carpet." â¢ ;>
"The jobs you offer," I remarked,
"are pretty Â» good, ; are they not ? ; .: Why
Is it you must spend so much breath in
getting men :to * take : them? ; I have
â heard it said that a *ob if. any kind
! was ; hard to ; get in " San Francisco, . yet
you '; seem ' to have â¢ plenty of work to
offer men ; and . you : find few takers.
How is that?" , T; - â¢ â¢'<V*y--- T ;> : >.-5:' :'::â :;â ,(
'â - "Well, i you see,"; returned : the : Crier,
"those men ; out there are .waiting ; for
higher wages. - They make ; the. rounds
of r the : whole street, â¢ read : .the signs,*
' hear the : talk and see .what is ; offered.
They are : just, as . emphatio ,: connois
seurs in selecting a Job ;as ; your wife
is , in buying tea. â Â£ They don't I pick iup
> anything f i that S comes - along; \ oh, no; I
I they're after snaps ; and they , are will
;; ing- to wait ; for them, ' They ; won't take
tnv old thins unless they hftTt to* and
they don't have to until the money
â with which they are paid off on their
last job is all gone; then they have to
take whatever they can get and get
out.
"Many of those men you see out there
have been walking up and down this
street on a lookout 'for jobs for three
weeks past, and they haven't taken
one yet. They're holding off, on the bull
side of the market. The employer is
on the bear side. I tell you, the thing
just pivots on a nice center. Let the
newspapers print a report of anything
that is likely to throw a number of men
out of work â any general thing like a
high wind, beating rain, or a bad frost
that destroys crops or fruit â and I will
fee-1 the effects of it the very next day.
When the syndicate or the corporation
sends to this office for men it offers
less than it did the day before; and it
will n<>t offer more until it is absolutely
pinched by the refusal of men to take
its jobs; then its bid will go up a notch
and keep going until labor accepts.
It's a play on the laborer's bedrock
necessities every time."
The condition seems to militate
strongly against progeny, and therein
abides a most vital problem for the
study of economists. "There are thou
sands of families in San Francisco,"
said the Crier, "many of whom are in
the deepest destitution, who would be
glad to go to the country and work on
the farms. But they have children and
children are barred; all the orders I
get say, 'send man and wife; no, don't
want couple with children; we've got
children enough of our own.' So these
people have to stay in the city and do
the best they can; and many of them
have mighty poor pickings, I tell you."
And thereupon is the reflection con
jured, if society shuts off the laborer
from reproducing, who wilt do the la
bor work for the future generations?
"Why don't you take a Job and go
to work?" I asked of one of the men
behind a pipe who, seated on a wooa
bench, was ably sustaining the weight
of one leg upon the other. "What
kind of work do you do? Carpenter?
There you are; three dollars a day with
only 60 cents off for board, and take
your blankets. What do you want bet
ter than that?"
"Well, sur, to tell yez the truth, Ol
don't think the job Is wort' the money
âthat is to say, Ol think it should pay
better than thot," was the reply.
"What class of work do you think
is the best for a man to engage in
now?" I asked.
"Well, sur, Oi should give it as me
opinion thot for an ordinary laborin'
mon, the best he could do wad be to be
a cook. There's always a demand for
thim; they get from thirty-five to forty
dollars a month an' found, an' the
clothes they wear costs thim next to
nothin'; an' what's more, the work's
easy, an', for the most part, he's hees
own boss. Did you ever hear thot
story about Alexander the Great an'
the Cynic? Well. Alexander, ye know,
said thot. 'If Oi war not Alexander Ol
wad be Diogene'; an' faith it's thot
way wid mesilf. If Oi war not a car
penter Oi wad be a cook."
The profits in conducting these labor
bourses must be very considerable,
since they are paid from $1 to $5 each
time they place an employe, the fee
invariably being the contribution of ths
laborer.
One concern told me that its averags
placement was over twelve hundred per
month, and that its books for last year
showed over 17,000 made during that
twelvemonth. At that rate the in
come of this concern could not have
been less than $25,000 for the perioa
named. As there are six of these con
cerns in the city, I estimate that
through them no less than 50,000 per
sons find positions annually, and that
the aggregate sum paid" by the labor
ers for the service thus rendered is be
tween $75,000 and $100,000.
JOHN E. BHNNETT.
TRICKS ON TRAVELERS,
Mr. Thorold, an English gentleman
who has just arrived at Tunis in his
320 ton yacht Lady Godiva, has had
an amusing experience. He was walk
ing his deck one afternoon, when he es
pied a gorgeous Oriental, dressed in the
most striking red and green, being
rowed about in a barge, and evidently
admiring the yacht exceedingly. Being
good-natured and fond of Orientals, Mr.
Thorold engaged the stranger in con
versation, and, finding him interested
in yachts, invited him to come on
board. The invitation was accepted,
and the stranger took occasion to men
tion that he was Princo Mahomet, son
of the Bey of Tunis. Mr. Thorold was
considerably impressed, and, after hav
ing shown his guest all over the yacht,
took him to his saloon, which is fur
nished with wonderful embroideries
and adorned with water colors by the
best masters. The Â»rincÂ» won every
body's heart, smoking some excellent
havanas and drinking a bottle of cham
pagne with the utmost condescensio-n.
When at last he took his leave he in
vited his host to return the visit at the
palace of Marsa next day, offering to
send carriages to fetch him.
Mr. Thorold went to a photographer
in the Avenue de la Marine to order an
instantaneous apparatus, which he
thought might be useful at the palace,
particularly as the prince had prom
ised to introduce him to his harem.
Next day the prince came to fetch Mr.
Thorold and graciously consented to
stop at the photographer's on the way.
The man was rather slow, and Mr.
Thorold sought to hurry him up by
mentioning that his Highness Prince
Mahomet was waiting outside. The
photographer came out with the parcel
and found that "his Highness" was a
notorious guide who haunts the bazars
and has often imposed upon strangers
in the most barefaced way. He once
went to Malta, represented himself as
a member of the family of the Bey of
Tunis and was entertained by a number
of officers for several days undetected.
QUEER SHOWS TN THE EAST,
MR. FREDERICK C. WHITNEY
once took a show composed of
cowboys, Indians, Mexican va
queros and American sharp-
shooters through India, China,
Japan and the Malay Peninsula. He
was speaking yesterday of some of the
queer places he "showed" in during hia
tour in those far-away countries.
"I found," he said, "that the Parsees,
the fire worshipers, who are the real
natives of India, gave opera in a crude
form in India over one thousand years
ago, and to my surprise I had to show
against a strong, well equipped organ
iiauon known as the Parsee Victoria
Company, which travels about .Lower
lrtiia, giving seasons of opera in the
native language, with scenery, cos
tumes and properties manufactured en
tireiy by native artists and mechanics,
and presenting operas by native com
posers.
"In the hill towns and the coast cities
I found fairly well constructed, com
foriable theaters, but in the small
towns of the outlying districts we had
t Â» give our entertainments in huge
bamboo walled and plantain leaf
thatched edifices, constructed express
ly fcr their native opera season. These
great halls, often large enough to seat
one thousand people, are lighted vi'h
lamps and candles, and the effect of a
theatrical entertainment given under
conditions which necessarily exist can
be more easily imagined than described.
"On the Malay Peninsula there were
a number of enclosures devoted to dra-'
matic entertainments, where only the
actors are protected by a roof. There
were no seats for the audience, exceut
a few benches on each side of the stage,
which were reserved for the titled na
tives, but for which no extra charge
is made., My audiences squatted on thÂ»
ground, and in the event of a shower
either relied upon umbrellas for pro
tection or dispersed. The stage and
dressing rooms for the actors were at
one end of the enclosure and covered
with a thatch. For lights, bamboo
poles were driven in the ground at reg
ular intervals, and on them were sus
pended cranes containing fire, which
were regularly fed with combustible
wood and tar. The walls were made
of bamboo poles driven into the ground
and braced from the inside. A money
taker and money changer sat on each
side of the single doorway and collected
the entrance fee.
"In upper Burmah I found dramatic
entertainments and pantomime given by
native companies on platforms at the
foot of gradually sloping hills, portions
of which are enclosed and used for the
audience. In nearly all hot countries
the dry season is the only theatrical
season, as it is impossible to give open
air entertainments during the mon
soons.
"In Japan I saw an entertainment
given in the dry bed of a river that
runs through th â¢ city of Hiogo. The
sloping blinks on each side were crowd
ed with spectators, and over 200 geishas
marched in a bridal procession divert
during the performance. No admission
to the entertainment was asked, the ac
tors and singers being paid by public
subscription raised by the merchants
when arrangements were made for the
annual tea fair, which is conducted in a
manner somewhat similar to our coun
ty or agricultural State fairs in this
country.
Tho humming: of telegraph wires I* a
phenomenon which has not yet been
satisfactorily explained. It is not caused
by wind, for it is heard during- perfect
calms. It has been conjectured that
changes of temperature, which tighten or
loosen the wires, probably produce the
sound.

A BAD CASE OF HEADACHE
performance quite â¢with the air of a
rather bored spectator. And then it
was all over and he was borne back
horne â since dogs petted as he is suffer
from "heimweh" to such an extent as
to Beriously affect their health â to be
nursed back to strength and activity
again.
"Properly looked after," said the
surgeon, "he will be as good as new in
three weeks," and then, washing his
hands of the matter literally as well as
figuratively, he took me for a tour of
inspection around his domain.
It is surprising to the previously un
informed mind to find how many Ills
dog-flesh is heir to. Besides distemper,
worms, fits and mange, which we have
come to consider regular dog diseases,
they are afflicted with many of the
physical troubles of human beings.
Pneumonia, gastritis, enteritis, con
sumption, ague, la grippe. Bright"? dis
ease, mumps, epilepsy, paralysis, acute
mania, diphtheria, rheumatism and
even elephantiasis, are ajl met with In
the practice of a dog doctor, and as he
must diagnose troubles entirely from
visible manifestations, with no help
whatever from the sufferer, it is neces
sary to exercise great care in every
case that is put in his charge.
When animals worth thousands of
dollars are put into one's hands for
treatment it doesn't do to make even
END OF THE SECOND WEEK.
The person who orders the vessel or
what her name is to be is a matter of
no importance to the shipbuilder. He
simply gets word to build a vessel ac
cording to certain drawings and speci
. fications and puts it down on his book
'â â  as a certain number. If the vessel is
ordered to be pushed through in
I a hurry he starts work immediately,
( and within a few luurs men are build
; ing the ways on which the vessel is to be
j constructed. Insideof twenty-four hours
; the keel will be laid and the sternpost
i ready to be placed in position. At this
| time there is not much to be seen only
j three lines of timber lying on the
ground. But this is the start.
A week lateV this same spot will have
a good part of a ship on it. Scores of
j men will be at work and the sound of
saw and hammer can be heard for a
mile. Nearly all the ribs of the vessel
will be in position and she will be ready
for the planking.
A week later a goodly portion of this
will be done. The entire lower -->rtion
will be covered and only the tips of the
ribs will show over the side of the
hull.
At this time the machinery is being
put in and more and more men are
finding work on her every day.
At the end of the third week the hull
is practically finished and in another
week the deck will be on and she will
be ready for launching. Now men
fairly swarm over her.
At the end of the fifth week masts
are in. rigging set and sails bent, and

The London Academy tells the fol

In company with a few friends the

armchair before the fire. Much to the
amazement of the other occupants of
the room he then proceeded to elevate
his feet until they rested on the chim

believe is "real American." No expos
tulations on the part of his friends re
specting the inelegance of the position
; were of the slightest avail. Suddenly
a brilliant inspiration seized one of them

your feet down or they'll mistake you

j poet's boots were on the floor, and he
assumed the ordinary position of an
Englishman.
I know of nothing more suggestive of

than this anecdote. To accuse Longfel

knowledge of the poet's character that
is simply ridiculous, and it is strange
to find a reputable literary' Journal

which is likely to do nothing more than

What were the best books of the year
1897 from a public librarian's stand
point? This is a question which pro
voked marked discussion at a recent
meeting of the New York Literary

great works from a librarian's point of

"The Gadfly," by E. L. Voynich.

I would like at this writing to call my
readers' attention to one of these
books, which it seems to me is hardly
well enough known on the Pacific

any space at all to this book. Notwith

The Belgians dearly love a procession, and In early
times used to celebrate all great national or municipal
events by a so-called "cavalcade" or "omgang," in which
the noted personages of Scripture and history were rep
resented. In many respects it was like the ancient En
glish Miracle plays. As far back as 1490, for instance,
there was a procession at Louvain, held to celebrate the
deliverance of the city by the defeat of the Normans,
and this procession, headed by a triumphal chair carry
ing the Virgin of Lou vain, contained Biblical characters,
trade tableaux, representations of the legends of chivalry
and earlier times, and "the giants."

Woynicz, according to the Critic, is a

themselves with a persistent vi

Its workings interest us more than the
fictitious scenes they treat.
Others we love for their creations.
Standing themselves in shadow, they
have introduced us to friend after
friend whom we have learned to know
intimately, whose aspirations and
temptations we have shared, whose
heart-throbs have echoed in our
breasts, at whose wedding bells we

we have mourned.
Marion Crawford belongs emphati

authorship, there Is probably not an
other man to be found of whom the
general public has read so much and
knows so little. With him we have
dabbled in occult mystery on the mount
of India or the street of Prague, with
him we have wandered for romance to
Arabia and to the Suabian forest. He
has peopled Rome for us with stately,
passionate, intensely human friends
with whom we are far more intimate
than with our next-door neighbors;
he has even introduced us, albeit more
superficially, to divers fashionable ac

in five hundred general readers who
can ticket off the daily doings of the
latest sensational novelist knows more
of Marion Crawford than this; he is
the author of "Saracinesca" and "Mr.
Isaacs."
The result is after a true author's
own heart. To be lost sight of in his
work is ever the artist's ideal. But it
is not the interviewer's ideal, and from
the moment that Mr. Crawford pui

THE CAVE OF AVARIGE.
HOW I came to Corpus Christl la Sonora I need not
tell; and I am plod I need not. for it is at the best
a shameful story. Yet there I fancied I could put
my past away. I was sure those I had wronged
would not follow me so far; and 1 felt safe â if a
man can be safe from his memories. For memories now
and then would come, would bother; then I loneed for
money with which to make restitution with a hurried de
sire. For what I had left was but a pittance, to keep me
for many years in this simple Mexican village. I had lost
most that I bad stolen In many venture*, taken in tho
vain hope.
Have you ever be>en in Mexico? Can you imagine that
village far away over the borderâ its long sunny street,
between the adobe houses; its listless folk, with mere of
the Indian than the Spaniard. High above on both sides
â¢was the street scattered slopes of the mountains; and a
Quarter of a mile up the valley on a rounded hill stood tho
old monastery of Corpus Christ!, bullded. it was said, by a
generation that had known Montezuma. Who knows? Per
haps the monks didâ these few brown-cowled brothers,
the survivors of the great order. As I sat idly smoki:::-r. I
â wondered at them, thinking how much easier a monastery
might have been for me.
I myself did not make the acquaintance of the monks.
The villagers sometimes chatted with me. I knew all the
affairs of my fat landlady and her black-eyed daughter,
about whom three young fellows were passionate. These
folk had been curious when I had appeared on donkey
back from over the slope. But habit stifle? curiosity, and
I lived on, almost the sole guest of the old Inn. For the
mountain village was out of the way of travel; centuries
had passed since it had been a station on the route to the
now long-abandoned silver mines of the mountains. And
days and months passed for me as they will in such an
.out-of-the-way place, where the events and talk of the
world seem of no moment; and, as I say, I longed with an
ever-increasing desire for all I had frittered awayâ honor
and position and love I had lost in tho New England town,
where the winters might be bitter and the summers fierce.
but where the old habit of my Ar.glo-Saxon blood called.
Ah, if I only had money to repair that wrong. For gold
I longed, and of its potentiality I dreamed.
I nad been at Corpus Christi a year before the two
who were to be my comrades appeared. One â 1 knew him
as John Fentonâ was a little clorkly, bookish man with a
certain fright always in bis sunken eyes; yet plainly a
man of gentle breeding. The other, who called himself
Dorden. was his antithesis, a burly, red-raced. oath-Hing
ing bravo. What interest I wondered did they have in
common. But I did not dare a?k them of their past, of
their bond of union, lest they should ask of mine. Possibly
they had the same reason, for they never inquired. We
knew that we belonged somewhere over the border. Iso
tion. and the same conditllon of past, make strange com
panionship.. In desperation among these simple village
folkâ l struck up a friendship with Dorden. Many a sunny
day we passed in the shaded court of the Inn playing
gloomily with a greasy pack Dorden had. On one thing
we agreed: we wanted money; that alone would repair
thÂ« cloak of respectability we had worn threadbare.
As we talked little Fenton would smile gloomily, and
would disappear up the slope to the monastery. For he
â trangely had made an acquaintance there: and" every day
he would return with a pile of old manufcripts from tho
library of the place; recordsâ forgotten by scholarsâ of
the early history of Sonora. Then Dorden let drop the
only remark he ever had about the pasts of either: Fenton
was a scholar, a linguist, who had oeeri a tutor at a New
England college. Again I wondered what had brought
together these two. so dissimilar.
One eveningâ ah. I never may forget it! â we were
sitting by flickering candles in my room. Dorden and I
at our gaming, and Fenton reading a manuscript he had
brought that day from the monastery. The monks, an

"In those days the Governor ruled Sonora not so much
as Miguel Santos. Nay. Santos laid tribute of the Gov
ernor, and of all who passed; and Miguel Santos' wealth
was great beyond imagination. Yet every piece of gold,
they say. was blood stained!"
"There are ethers," said Dorden, dealing the cards.
"Listen." said the other rather eagerly.
"But in his old age remorse seized Santos and he re

"Well, go on with your yarn, little "un."
"Well," said Fenton, "I said to myself, if this Miguel
Santos became a monk at Corpus Christ! there's probably
somewhere or other about this pile of papers something 1
more about him. Finally I came to some papers of the
Abbot Pedro Juan. I knew he was the Abbot of Santos'
time. So 1 broke open the seal. Then I found this paper
written by the dying Santos."
"You don't say! Who'd have thought it?" Dorden ex

that death cannot be far away. The church declares that
the wicked shall be burned forever. If that be indeed true
âand no man ever came back to deny itâ it behooves me
to prepare. I have thought me of the treasure I gained
evilly. Should I restore it to those whence 1 had taken?
But the lult for gold makes more crime than the lust for
women. It has seemed to me, then, that I should put this
treasure away where no man should find It. I know now
my sin. I could not part with that which has cost me so
muchâ perhnps even my soul. To the cave of the under
ground river I had the casks carried. Then I had a waJl
built twenty rods from the cave's entrance, and I walled
the treasure there against the roar of the stream that
sees no light. Twenty men worked at this; and I watched,
leaving a guard down the slope. In the wall is an iron
door, which opens if you touch It at a certain spot. When
the work was done I gave the laborers poison, and in the
morning all lay dead. (God rest my soul.) One by one 1

"I took the bodies through the door in the wall to the
cliff over the underground river, and dropped them in. one

And then I discharged all and came down the mountain
to the monastery, and to the abbot I said: - I would repent
me of my sins!" 'First.' he answered, "thou must give all
thy treasure to Mother Church.' Then I lied, and told him
I had squandered it all.
"I said to myself that 'for one who has committed so
many sins, the death of twenty men and the lie to the
abbot cannot add to the burden.' For, from that time on.
I should lead me a life of prayer, of repentance. So In

You can safely touch a match to any piece of smokeless
powder held in the hand. It will simply burn rather slowly
with a slight sputtering and with a weird, yellow, smoke
less blaze, and if the piece is small and tne flame so not
very strong you can blow out the flame with. your breath
and repeat the experiment. And you can sarely whack
the stuff around, too. One of these tough straps would
be an excellent thing to spank a bad little boy with.
If a whole magazine of this powder were set afire and
the door were open to allow the gases to escape the pow

It requires a detonation to explode the stuff and if
there are detonators around it is well to be careful.

said Fenton. "But there is one line more in another hand.

â¢world as Miguel Santos.' "
"What- a fool that old chap was. anyway," said Dor
den. "With all that money, he might have had a time fit
for a king, without botherin' himself about hell."
"With all that money," I said. "Do you suppose it's

"Do you.'spose It is. It fairly makes my mouth water,"
Dorden observed.
"If it were there," said the pale-face<3 Fenton, "I've

"No more than I," said Dorden.
"No more than I." said I.
But I was watching the yellowed parchment which
Dorden was holding, as I have said, low over the candle.
Black lines were appearing there. I gasped as I saw them.
Was this that old secret? Had he written it on the back
of the confession? Should we know it then? Should we
get the gold with which I might make my restitution?
"The paper's back, Fenton!" I cried.
Fenton turned the paper, scared, while Dorden sent

"Read itâ for God's sake, read it! Can you?"
Fenton read in a low voice:

The air that swept our faces was singular y fresh i ana
sweet, due to the waters that we heard now in a deaien

all three turned about, our faces blanching. And then a
strange thing occurred. A pale white light began to ba
diffused. I could not account for It then: though now i
understand that the shifting sun had reached some open-

vast stream, indeed; a sheer fall of many Hundred feet as
we now were able to see. The farther shore we could not

twilight; but it seemed to me as broad as the Hudson. 1
Whence did it come? and whither were those waters car Â»-**,
ried in their mad whirl? But I was interrupted by Dor
den's cry. He was pointing toward^a projecting cliff,
which hung out far over the water. It was approached by
a narrow neck, so that it formed a peninsula jutting into
the air above the roaring waters. The space might hava
had a diameter of fifty feet. But what we saw astounded
us even in our expectations, now raised by the success of
every step of the search. On this sDaco were above a
score of iron chests, their lids all opened, revealing in the
increasing light the sheen of diamonds, the blue and green
of sapphires and the glow of rubies. They lay there beck
oning, as Miguel Santos had left them, rrnm many of
the chests was the absorbing yellow glare of golden coins:
bo many that in the moment we could not calculate their
number. Yet we knew that here was wealth such as
Croesus' Incalculable riches of gold, and precious stones.
But why had they been put on that jutting rock? I ques
tioned.
I don't believe the others ever Questioned.- Now that
we could see quite plainly, Dorden cast the candle down,
into the depths, and almost ran toward the treasure. I
saw him dizzily rushing along the narrow passage, and
kneeling before one of the chests, and crying out like a
maniac. Fenton was close behind him, gloating over the
Jewels. As I followed he picked from one of the chests
a piece of manuscript.
"What is this, he said, holding it up, for the light
now was strong enough for us to read by it.
"More of Santos' words!" he added.
"Look at the gold, not papers." Dorden cried. But the
instinct of the scholar mastered Fenton even in that
moment.
"Miguel Santos' â writing:," he said; and sJowly he
rendered:
"Gold thou comest by dishonestly shnlt curse thee
always. For sin must be penance. Fool, thou shalt perish
with thy gold and precious stones. The punishment of
God on the miser is that he shall not keep *nat he gloats
on."
"Fool!" came Dorden's voice, hissing over our should
ers. I looked at him almost fearfully, for there was a
maddish glare in his eyes. Suddenly, like a fiend, ha
threw himself on us both. "It shall be mine," he cried.
"Only mine." The onslaught carried us all three near the
edge, Fenton and I struggling to hold him r>ack. In some
way â God knows how â I disentangled myself, and turned
just at the edge. My companions were not there; but
from afar was a little splash, while a voice cried out, in.
horrid despaJrâ it indeed may have been my strained im
agination, and yet. indeed, it may have been Dorden's.
"Cursed! Cursed!" came that fearsome cry. Fear
some. I say, for I was fleeing- I was across tne narrow
passage, and as I reached the firmer earth I heard a great
and crumbling behind. Awed even in my fear I looked
about.
The air seemed to be filled with flying coins and jewels,
sending out yellow and red, blue and green flashes, and
then the earth gave away, that great crag- sank, and a
momentâ yes. it might have been a moment, but it seemed
to me a tediously horrible day â there came a mighty
splash, and a spray struck my face, even where I stood,
so far above the surface of that great river which begins
and ends in the bowels of the earth. Its oottom at this
point you may find, should you examine, strewn with old
Spanish coins and jewels, and perhaps with the bones or
men. Yet most of that great wealth may have been
carried by the forceful current of the river far on under

SCIENCE'S latest promke is that
we will poo- be able to i â Â« around
the world.
And not only is th.. promised,
but it is almost an assured sue-
cess. In fact, a concession for
exhibiting a "distance-seer" apparatus
has been granted for the Paris Exposi
tion in 1900 and there are millions of
dollars behind the promoters. The in
struments have been tested and there is
no doubt that everything will work
perfectly.
When the big exposition opens this
preatest wonder of the century will be
on public view so that all may see at
so much per head. That it will draw
a crowd goes without saying.
It is the intention of the promoters to
reproduce in Paris BCenes from other
parts of the world. Wherever wires can
be fixed there views can be taken and
conveyed instantly to Paris.
Then the visitor, seated comfortably
In an opera chair, can look upon the
smoking heights of Mount Etna and a
moment later be watching an ascent
over the ice and snow of Mount Blanc.
Street scenes in all the big cities will
bf faithfully reproduced, and should the
opportunity present itself real battle
scenes will be thrown on a screen and
be perfect all but the sound. But it is
thought that even this latter can be re
produced by apparatus that is now in
course of construction and will be
Bomewhat on the pattern of the phono
grraph.
The apparatus that is to convey the
actual reproduction of distant scenes
has been christened the "teleleetro-
Fcope" by iis inventor. This man bears
the non-pronounceable name of Herr'
pantk. He is a Gallcian by
birth, and a year or so ago was teaeh
lnÂ§r school in a small country town. It
was all he could do then to keep body
and soul tos-ether, but now he can
draw on many millions of dollars
promised by deeply interested capital
ist?, who firmly believe he has discov
ered "the biggest money maker yet
found."
Herr Pzczepanik calls his apparatus
the "telelectroscope" because it renders
objects visible In their natural colors
nt a distance by means of electricity.
The manner In which this Is effected
is somewhat difficult of clear explana
tion. From tho Inventor's representa
tive In London the following particu
lars have been gathered as to the
method of transmission:
Roughly speaking, the pipture is
broken up Into a number of points.
Each point is reflected in mirrors, and
the reflected ray of light Is converted
Into an electric current, which can be
transmitted any distance. At the re
ceiving end the current is again trans
formed into the corresponding ray of
litrht. This ray of light is reflected in
mirrors and the reflection thrown upon
a screen. Now, it follows that if all the
points of a picture are taken in very
rapid succession the resultant reflection
on the screen will be the entire picture.
In greater detail, it seems that there
are two mirrors at the receiving end
and two more at the transmitting end.
Each mirror has its surface coated with
pome opaque substance. Across this
opaque covering a straight-lined
scratch is made with a needle or knife,
fo that only a narrow linear strip of
reflecting surface is exposed. The pur
pose of this is that only a single line of
the object under observation may be
exposed to the reflective influence of
the mirror. The mirror (the first one in
which the object is reflected) is fixed on
a pivot, by means of which (with the
aid of an electro-magnet) it is con
tinually oscillating, so that the lines of
the object under observation are con
tinually changing.
Each of these single line pictures Is
broken up into points by means of the
Fecond oscillating mirror, which is
placed at right angles to the first, so
that its reflecting line is at right angles
to the reflecting line of the first. As
two lines intersect each other in a
point, it follows that only a single point
of the reflecting line of the first mir
ror will appear in the second mirror,
and therefore only the reflected ray
which corresponds to this point will be
reflected in the second mirror. The two
mirrors oscillate synchronously.
This ray of light, which corresponds
to a certain point in the picture, Is con
verted into an electric current by thÂ©
employment of an electric battery with
a selenium cell. The property of a
selenium cell is that its electrical re
sistance varies with the color of the
light to which it is exposed; it is ener
gized in different degrees by different
rays. A blue ray, say, will have a
very powerful effect upon it, while a
red ray will set up a very weak cur
rent.
This electric battery is connected by
wires with an electro-magnet at the re
ceiving end, -where the electric currents
are to be reconverted into rays of light.
The electro-magnet will accomplish this
by moving in sympathy with the elec
tric current sent out from the transmit-
ting apparatus, and its movements will
necessarily correspond to the nature of
the ray reflected. A blue ray, for in
stance, wculd move it a considerable
distance, while a red ray would only
slightly deflect it.
Now this magnet is made to move a
prism, which is placed in front of a
strong white lightâ either the light of
the sun or an electric light. The action
of the prism will break the white light
up into its seven prismatic colors. These
colors are spread out in a spectrum.
The prism being moved by the electro
magnet, it will necessarily revolve just
so far as to bring the required color
into view.
This color will now be reflected In
one of the two oscillating mirrors at the
receiving end. And just as the action
of the other two mirrors was analytic
so the action of these two is. Each
point of the picture is reflected on
a screen, and as the points follow- one
another in very rapid succession in
deed, the eye of the observer will take
in the impression of the entire picture
as if its points were all presented to it
simultaneously.
The picture can be made to last as
lang as may be desired by constantly
reproducing the effect, and at such a
speed that the observer is unconscious
of any break in the process. It is no
more difficult to reproduce a moving
picture than a still one, for the inven
tor explains that "it is the actual pic
ture which is reproduced, and not a
mere record as in the case of the kine
matograph."
Another point claimed is that there
is practically no limit of the distance
â within which the apparatus can be
used. With the possibility of a tele
phone wire 1000 miles long, such as that
between Chicago and New York, the
Inventor thinks that the telectroscope
wires might be of any length.
Such an instrument, of course, opens
up a wide field of possibilities. Scenes
of foreign travel, battle fields during
action, and the eclipse of the sun are
only a few of the things we might have
seen recently, while sitting comfortably
at home, had Herr Szezepanik had his
machine well established a little earlier.
As It is, the question arises, has not
this Galician genius done away with tne
necessity of visitors actually going to
Paris in 1900?
Like most other inventions that are
for the reproduction of any kind of vi
bration the telelectroscope seems to have
one or two weaknesses. A number of
scientific men who were given a private
view of its workings, while surprised and
pleased even beyond their wildest ex
pectations, stated to the editor of a Lon
don paper that "the invention seems to
have been inspired by the kinemato
graph, and it is said that the images
resemble to the kinematographic im
ages, and are shivering like these."
Again, "Thence follows that the image
does not appear in the natural colors,
but in the corresponding spectral col
ors, and the colors in which the image
appears are not quite clear."
But such a slight objection at such
an early hour after the invention can
surely be overcome in a short time,
possibly before the opening of the Paris
exhibition.
After the Paris exhibition it is the in
tention of the promoters of the telelc
troscope to exploit it in all the big
cities of the world.
Of course San Francisco will be in
cluded, and when that time comes you
can step into the place when the ap
paratus is on exhibition and see what

big cities over a thousand miles east

The most remarkable feature of the
invention of the telelectroscope is the in
ventor himself, because he proves in his
person that Inventors are like artists â
born, not made. Jan Szczepanik is an
Austrian Pole, and only 24 years of age.
He was so poor that he was forced to
quit the university and become a
schoolmaster in hia native village.
Three years i~o he apnlied, in a
crudely written letter, to the Austrian
Ministry of War for assistance in pat
enting his "Fernseher."
But Austria is a country where in
ventors proverbially go a-begging, and
nothing might have come of the young
man's discovery had he not been taken
in hand by a Vienna banker, Herr Lud
DREARY WORK
OF A LAUNDRY GIRL
One Week's Experience of a Woman Among the San Francisco Laun
dries to Ascertain How the Girls Work, How They Are Treated,
How They Are Paid and How They Live.
MONDAY morning: I applied for
work at the San Francisco
Laundry and pot "on," as they
say. Nine others had applied,
two quite young girls in short
dresses.
I was to receive $10 a month, board
and room. I was taken to the mangle
room. I hung up my hat and coat and
began to earn a living at laundry work.
My first task was to fold towels, piles
and piles and endless piles, hot from the
mangle. As I made the acquaintance
of the San Francisco hotels by the qual
ity and color of the towels, I wished
to look about, but with the eye of the
"forelady" on me I attended strictly
to business and folded "two times
twice" and "three times over."
After countless hours I was told to
"come along," and I went. At another
table I shook out wet pillow-slips and
piled them up, hems all one way, and
tried to keep out of the way of an old
man, who trotted about with piles of
wet linen.
He whistled at me and told me to "get
along there," and when I did not get
along sufficiently quick he threw my
pile of pillow-slips in a heap and swore,
and defiantly said, "What are you go
ing to do about it?"
Perhaps 100 men and girls were
crowded into the room. The steam
from the wet clothes in the hot
mangles went to meet the steam from
the washers and rolled about in clouds.
The machines slopped suds on to the
floor, where the water stood in puddles.
With my feet wet and the hot mangle
at my head, in the awful atmosphere
where an occasional kindly breeze,
strong with ammonia, cloaked the con
tinuous odors of soiled linen, I only
wondered what girl could stand it for
five years. The overseer came through
occasionally and looked sharply about,
and the forewoman was Ã¼biquitous.
With a tongue in place of a lash she
told this one to hurry up and that one
to "be lively there." Woe to the girl
caught talking! She was reminded in
no mincing words that "it was not to
talk she was hired."
A shrieking noise, the dinner whistle
made me drop a pillowslip on the dirty
floor. This did not escape the eyes of
the "forelady," as she checked the girls
till their work was left in order.
The backless wooden bench, where I
found a place to sit at the long dinner
table seemed a God-given luxury after
standing for five hours. A pretty little
girl who sat next to me, just 14, helped
me to forage. â¢ ; v

Every one worked steadily, scarcely
wig Kleinberg, who may virtually be
said to have discovered the Edison of
Europe. Indeed, it is confidently pre
dicted of this stripling that he will
leave Edison far behind.
He is said to possess very little tech
nical knowledge; but in spite of this
fact he was able, the moment he set
eyes on a silk-weaving loom, to hit
upon an idea revolutionizing tlie manu
facture of Gobelins, which, b means
of an electric. 1 process, can now be
produced at one-twentieth of the for
mer cost. The p .tent hai just been
sold to a ring in England for $250,000.

iooking up, as if each were engaged in
a neck and neck race. I saw no one
loitering. As the hours went by and
the shadows cr-pt farther out into the
washroom the faces became more and
more tired and drawn. The whole room
was alive with machinery, and the
whirling wheels and belts and the
deafening noise made me dizzy as I
walked between the machines to where
I was to help shake out bedspreads,
pile after pile, as fast as I could. Wet
bedspreads are heavy. My head ached.
It was as if time had forgotten to go
on and I was a machine. An old
man came in, walked about and looked
sharply at everything. As he stood
rubbing his hands, gloating over the
piles of linen and noisy machines, and
men and women, counting his profits,
a feeling of rage came over me that he
could hold us there in slavery â that
weak, old man. To him went the profits,
to us the deadening toil. I wondered
that r,o one hurt him, but none seemed
even to notice him as he stood there.
The white, unhealthy faces of the
girls told their own tale of working
fr.om 7 a. m. to 9 or 9:30 at night, as
they were doing until some weeks ago.
Then the girls sent word to the Com
missioner of Labor. The hours have
been shortened since, but it has been a
duller season. Soon the summer will
increase the amount to be got out and
then? Only in the mangle-room, how
ever, have the hours been improved.
There unremitting vigilance keeps the
girls at the highest tension for sixty
two hours a week at the rate of about
4 cents an hour, and at work which
makes them worn-out, old women at
20 years.
In other departments we found Â»"lrls
working seventy-one hours' a week. Ev
erything is arranged with a view of profit
to the corporation from the artesian
wells to the regulation whereby one
who earns 35 cents per day receives 15
cents if she work half a day and loses
20 cents irrespective of which half she
may work or lose. The sick list is an
eloquent commentary on the system.
Girls are always absent for sickness,
losing their pay Those who work
after hours receive no extra pay.
The room allotted to me as my sleep-
Ing room received its entire supply of
air for three through a transom over
the door into the hall. Two beds nearly
filled the room. No springs under the
filthy mattresses, no pillowcase on the
dirty straw pillow, and the bedding in
a condition indescribable, made me de
cide that I would go home to sleep,
as very many of the employes do.
There are not rooms enough for all,
although the room and board are in
cluded in the wages.
The room was furnished with two
chairs, no tables, no bureau, no closet.
An old man has charge of the oil with
which to fill the lamps, but his fre
quent absences are so many cents on
the right side for the company. So
nothing is said, and the employes
either buy their own oil or sit in the
dark. Men and women take care of
their own rooms and even make their
own bed linen when they can get it,
which is not always.
I asked Mr. Biggy of the United
States Laundry what they counted as
the cost per capita to board the em
ployes. He told me $5 a month, and at
the United States it is optional whether
the employe has or has not board. If
he boards himsflf a difference of $5
is made in his wages. Not so at the
San Francisco. Nearly all of the girls
have homes which they help support
out of their slender wages, and this
$5 or a third of their entire wages,
would be a great help at home.
The quarters of the men are adja
cent to those for the girls. There is
no discipline, no restriction put upon
either; and such an atmosphere can
not but be deteriorating to a young girl
whose sole home is an airless room
during the Sunday hours when she Is
not at work.
In not one Instance did I see any pro
vision whatever for the comfort or con
venience of the employes. In the en
tire laundry there Is not a chair, though
in other .laundries we found girls sit
ting at their work and doing it quite

as quickly and as well. If the girls
are ill they are in their rooms, and If
friends will carry them food, all right.
Everywhere the smaller mangles are
heated by gas, and being exactly In
front of the operator's mouth she must
breathe this hot air all day. In one
laundry only we found protectors; they
can be put on at a very small cost.
One man I found, who was a pathetlo
example of the system. His voice was
quite gone, and to any observer It is
but too evident how nearly his days
are done. It was all right; he had
nothing to say against the laundries.
People were willing to work twelve or
sixteen hours a day and glad to get the
chance. When folks are compelled to
work, they expect to work. In one
breath he told me it was a frequent
thing for a man to lose his hand or
part of it, and he was lucky if he could
get back to work when the injury had
healed. Scarcely had he finished the
Bentence when he took it back and said
the laundries were all right. When he
got stronger he expected to go back
and would not hazard his chance of em
ployment â not to save the lives of all
the rest of the world.
It seems very unfair that laun
dries like the La Grande, White
Star and United States should have to
compete with the sweat shops, and yet
none of these seem to be in danger of
immediate bankruptcy. Their employes
have reasonable hours, get good pay
and are healthy-looking, in great con
trast to the white, drawn faces and
bloodless lips at some of the other laun
dries.
Mr. Biggy is the vice-president at the
United States and the superintendent.
The girls there are healthy, not worn
out and can get their work finished
and be home at a good hour, for there
are no girls in the boarding-house at
tached to this laundry._
We found Mr. Biggy bandagin~ the
hand of a girl who had been injured.
Her expenses and salary were paid
during her absence and Mr. Biggy
hopes to be able to have the hand as
good as ever. The girl works a few
hours a day, receiving full pay, al
though the accident was her fault and
caused by wearing a ring, contrary to
rules.
The Electric should come under no
tice of the Board of Health. The
St. Nicholas was quite as bad.
It was a peculiar place, tumble down
and illy ventilated, with a toilet room
without water, off tie room where the
girls work. The manageress tried to
impress us with the fact that it was a
small paradise, and that her dear girls
scarcely worked at all. and were well
paid for overtime. The girls told m*
the same and her pay roll was a thing
to admire.
Later I went upstairs, and Me.
Green of the Labor Commission talked
to the girls without her, and they de
clared it was a common thing for them
to be working at 11 o'clock at night.
Never did they receive any extra pay
when they signed the pay roll.
I have visited many of the homes of
the girls, and have seen how indispen
sable is the pittance earned, where
small girls are supporting sick mothers
or fathers and small children. It is pit
iful that these young heroines are not
protected by the same law which would
be quick to find them if they trans
gressed.
I went home with a woman whose
face had attracted me in one of the
places where I worked. It was only a
short distance from the laundry and
was much cleaner than the appearance
of the girl had led me to expect. As we
went along, looking into the uncur
tained windows at the family groups,
Nora's steps quickened. In one a man
was rocking a baby to sleep and smok
ing a pipe, while a woman sat near
mending, her feet on the hearth of the
cook stove.
Nora said It always made her feel
wicked when she went home at night,
empty handed, to her babies, who were
alone all day, for she must eat at the
laundry, and v,-hat she earned only
bought enough to keep them all alive
and clothed.
The children sat quietly on the floor,
waiting for her to come and give them
supper. The room was dark, except for
a street lamp. They were very glad to
see their mother. The small boy had
his share of the caressing, too, but he
remembered something, arjd was In a
great excitement. "My Minna can go,
my Minna can go," and he pulled the
tiny girl to her feet, where she bal
anced alone. Then he ran to the other
Bide of the room and held out his hands
to his sister, and sure enough she walk
ed straight off to him, but her pride and
excitement were too much to be carried
by the little legs and down she went.
Then such a praising and petting and
hugging as the girlie had!
On the floor were scattered a few toys

was the little one's
playground and the
only ground they
ever saw except on
Sunday. Three
chairs, a table, a
bed, a cradle and a
cooking stove made
all the furniture.
On the floor, a pil
low, dented and
soiled, with a nurs
ing bottle beside it,
told how the little
ones rested in the
long hours they
were alone, for
Nora could only
run home a mo
ment at noon. In
a few minute 3 she
had their supper
ready. "Corn mush
seems more satis
fying than any
thing else I can
get," and with a
little milk and su
gar the children
seemed to think so,
too.
After the little
ones were in bed
Nora got out some
sewing and worked
by the light of a
candle. I was tired
to death and went
to bed and it seem
ed only a few min
utes when Tommy
climbed into bed
and woke us up
and Nora said we
had overslept and
must hurry to be at
the laundry in time
for work.
Breakfast was
the same as supper.
Nora had taken out
a small quantity of
the yellow mush,
and, to my inquir
ing look as she
placed it back on
the table well ouv
of the children's
reach, she said:
"Tim might come,
and he'd like a bite
to eat, for he'd be
down in the mouth
and ashamed, and
me away. Oh, I
known I'm a fool,
but you see â well,
Tim's Tim. Maybe
you'll have a man
of your own some
day and you'll
know how Jt is."
St. Joseph, to
whom she prays,
must be indeed
deaf and dead if
he does not hear
this poor "washer
lady" and take care
of Tim and send
him back to the
overburdened mo-
ther.
This woman
works eleven ttÂ»
eighteen hours a
day and receives
$13 a month.
As we walked
along Nora told me
of a girl who had
worked with her. it
troubled her much
thinking of her own
lassie at home, but
she could see no
way out of It.
Lilly's parents
had come from
Denmark. Her fa
ther had been able
to earn a good
many comforts for
his family, and at
his death his wife
owned her home
and a little money
besides. Lilly had hoped to get a g-ood
education, but when her father died she
had left school and gone to work at the
laundry. Like most children of Euro
pean parents, every cent she earned
was carried home, and the mother could
spare little of the scanty $10 a month
for the girl herself. Two years past
she worked every day from 6:30 till 10
at night, for her duty was to be there
to dampen the shirts ready for the
lroners at 7. Like all young things,
Lilly saw only never-ending grind of
her labor; no time ever except on Sun
days, and then her one desire was to
He and sleep. She earned so little she
could have nothing herself of the pleas
ures girls live for, and saw no hope but
to become worn out at 20, as the other
girls were. One morning Lilly did not
go to work. Nora tried to find her.
She knew how the girl would need a
friendly word, and to her own family
she was worse than dead. Aa Nora
said: "Well, God, he konws."
At another place I had met the moth
er at the laundry where she had gone
to take something to her daughter who
worked there. Such a sweet old face.
She said she was sorry that she had
troubled me. She had cried when I
spoke to her and told me that her eld
est daughter was at home very ill and
that as at home she never dared cry
and relieve her feelings, so she always
left the house when she wanted a good
cry and couldn't keep her tears to her
self any longer. She asked me to go
home with her and see her daughter.
It was a bright room with the air â¢-â ?
home. A few plants, some few prints
adorning the walls, some sort of savory
mess cooking on the stove in the cor
ner, and the sunshine flooding the room
and brightening the girl who lay on
the couch with her eyes closed, made it
hard to realize what the woman had
told me.
"She was such a strong girl, but she
began to work before she was 14. You
see, my man died and there was six
little ones and we had to do the best
we could, not what we wanted: and she
was the oldest. At the laundry she
earned $7 50 a month, and as the girls
were old enough they went there too.
They have to work and do not know
how to do anything else, and the wages
are so small they never have anything
left, so they just have to take what
comes.
"One of the girls goes to work at 5:30
and has worked till sometimes 11:30 at
night. The others begin at 7 and work
till often 8 and 9. and it is just killing
them. Mattie will never go back again
I know, but it just breaks my heart to
see the others going the same way.
They will all break down sooner or
later, and there seems to be no hope."

of which the Alaska will be the pilot
balloon.
The project has been carefully stud
ied by M. Varicle, who has recently
made several trial trips in company
with M. Terwange, a distinguished
traveler, who has received the degree
of Doctor of Laws; M. Besac, an engi
neer, and M. Richard, an expert me
chanic. All these trips gave satisfac
tory results except the last, made from
the French city of Lille, when, the re
lease being made before the captain
gave the order, the balloon, called the
"Fram," failed to clear the houses and
was brought back to the starting
place too late for the ascent to be made
that day.
Previous to that M. Varlcle had made
the Journey from Paris to Dieppe, tack-
Ing constantly toward the west by
means of the sail he had Invented and
using the guide-rope as a point of sup
port.
.Another time he went from Paris to
Hamburg, remaining in the air for
twenty-four hours.
But the most conclusive trial was the
journey from Paris to Tours, which
lasted thirty-four hours, during which
there were three landings by which M.
Varicle's son and Captain Mallet were
set down en route.
This last ascension gave ample proof
of the efficacy of the "auto-lesteurs," or
automatic ballast-lighters, as anchors,
another Invention of M. Varicle's which
was suggested by the cone anchor and
permits of a descent without loss of
gas. â

lected attains sufficient weight to stop

RAISING MORNING GLORIES
ON SWEET POTATO VINES.
New freaks developed in plant life by J. VV. Mill Is at the Experi
periment Station at Pomona. . Experiments in the same line
go to show that many of the common native plants in Cali
fornia may be utilized in raising good fruits and flowers by
scientific grafting.
The French have long been dexterous
in the art of grafting, and, while a few
useful plants have been gained in this
way, the result, in the main, has been
the production of oddities. Thus a sim
ple cottage garden in the suburbs of
Paris often contains trees each flowering
in a half-dozen forms, widely different
in appearance and perhaps bearing two
or three varieties of edible fruits be
sides.
The experiment stations of the Uni
versity of California have done some
notable work in this line.
In all successful attempts at graft
ing plants nearly related botanically
have been selected.
The potato has been grafted on
the tomato, and vice versa, yielding
when the potato plant was used as the
root excellent edible produce, both
above ground and below.
While this is not of much economic
value in this country, because the
labor of grafting is not compensated
by the saving in acreage, it is occa
sionally practiced in small house-gar
den plats with gratifying results.
Of no more economic value is the
most recent freak developed by J. W.
Mills at the experiment station at Po
mona. A variety of sweet potato is
made to bear moon flowers (large night
blooming morning glories) in great pro
fusion.
. While the vegetable-monger with his
heart set on filthy lucre would hardly
graft his plants for the esthetic Joy
which would thus be afforded, a town
lot might have the fence adorned with
morning glories for the delectation of
the esthetic members of the family,
without a suggestion of the homely
utility served by the roots.
Mr. Mills planted out his sweet pota
toes in the ordinary way, after having
started them in a hot bed. When they
were well rooted he inserted the bud,
as shown by the accompanying illus
tration.
Some of our people like the French
and other Europeans find that they
can crowd into a small orchard such as
would be found in a suburban town lot
a far greater variety of fruit, by means
of judicious grafting, than would other
wise be possible.
In this way luscious pears are gath
ered from one limb of an apple tree;
or, still better, from a pear grafted
upon a quince stock producing a very
small tree bearing an abundance of
large fruit.
Nature allows herself considerable
freedom In her behavior in this regard,
and refuses to reveal her reasons, even
though learned men puzzle and scratch
their scalps. For example, the pear
apple experiment will not work both
ways. Thus far no one has been able
to reverse the order with very grati
fying results.
It was attempted recently In a large
pear orchard near Santa Rosa. Believ
ing that apples would yield better re
turns, the owner has grafted the trees.
The occurrence is too recent to expect
the testimony of practical results. If,

A HOST OF DESCENDANTS.
Mrs. Sallie Shiver, who lives In the east
ern portion of this county, says an Al
bany, Ga., correspondent of the St. Louis
Globe-Democrat, has 235 living children,
grandchildren, great-grandchildren and
great-great-grandchildren. In addition to
these, seventy-five of the old lady's de
scendants are dead, making the total
number 310. The two hundred and thirty
fifth link in the old lady's lineage came
last week, and is the cause of objection
on her part on unique grounds. She as
serts that as she considers it her duty to
visit each relative once in two years, the
ever extending . circle draws on her
strength more than she can spare.
Mrs. Shiver is in her ninetieth year, but
enjoys remarkably good health. She can
j walk several miles without fatigue. Her
mind is clear, and the weight of nearly a
hundred years has left little impress on
her erect carriage. She is a perfect mine
regarding local and State history, and is
j a great favorite as a raconteur. The re
; markable progeny for which Mrs. Shiver
i is responsible sprang from seven chil-
I dren born to her and Manning Shiver,
who died in 1565 at the age of 60 years.
The oldest child is 70 and the youngest 43.
From this stock has spread out in fan
; like array the immense family, probably
I unrivaled in numbers in the South. Each
I descendant having a family receives a
i visit from Grandmother Shiver In regular
j rotation. She completes the circuit once

however, he succeeds in making a
commercial success of his experiment,
it will be the first of its kind.
Occasionally the agricultural depart
ment of the university is called upon
to believe in some notable freak, as in
a case a few years ago near Placerville.
They were told that an old grape vine
had been grafted with a rose, but
scientific investigation showed the old
stump to be a gnarled and weather
beaten lose trunk.
At another time a grape was report
ed as successfully grafted into a cac
tus, and it was represented that this
combination would be of great value,
as the arid lands could thus be used
for vineyards.
The Universkv men were not easily
convinced that nature would deviate
from the usual course of uniting only
the fibers of closely allied species, and
make a solitary exception of these two
plants widely separated in the vegeta
ble kingdom, but when letter after let
ter came averring it and ocular proof
followed in a fine specimen of the
grapes they thought well to investi
gate. And the sight of a very interest
ing phenomenon repaid them. A grape
plant had rooted itself in the cactus and
was receiving from it moisture and
nourishment. Of course, it bore no
other interest than that of a curiosity,
as the grape must die shortly after the
cactus did. which would not be very
long after the grape began its inroads.
INDIAN FIGS GRAFTED ONTO PRICKLY PEAR.
As a rule the nearer the plants stand
related the more certain of success is
the grafting experiment, but not al
ways.
The Japanese plum does not graft
well on our ordinary plum trees, but
thrives on the peach. In the East it
has even been found to suffer from the
yellows and other diseases of the peach
that the other plum trees escaped.
Professor Wickson has at his home
in Berkeley one piece grafted on a plum
and one on a peach stock, the latter
having made ten times greater growth.
The apricot will grow well on a
peach or plum, but will invariably
break off If grafted on an almond tree.
It may live for a few years and bear
fruit, but some day or some night a
gale will be sure to break th*e bond.
The gourd or melon family are very
susceptible to grafting. Cucumbers,
muskmelons and water melons have

of ..fashion that the changes are not no- I

The last model by Loisei represents the
back and front of a fancy dress hat for
â  the theater, made of gauze, spangled
with jet and strass, trimmed with small
black featherÃ. The crown is made so
that the hair can pass through it.
The firm of Cuverville makes a feature of
| headdressing for fancy dress balls or
Lsoirees. One of its most successful crea
f tions is a headdress in the Louis XVI
j style, with the hair in very broad waves,
turned quite up in front and at the sides,
and forming three pads on each side of
j the head. Eehlnd the ears hang long
: curls very tightly rolled. On the head is
i a kind of beretta of white tulle spangled
with silver, draped and caught up on the
| left side by a strass buckle. The hat is
' trimmed with five ostrich feathers and an
: aigrette. The headdress is made with
i marteaux poudres, one above another be
i hind.
Another headdress is in the English
i style of the eighteenth century. The hair
! is turned up over the forehead and at the
Bides, forming broad waves, which are
: continued right up to the top of the head.
:At the sides are long pendent curls. A
I large hat of blue velvet edged with pearls
! is worn rather far back on the head, and
I is trimmed with four dwarf feathers and
: two tall ostrich feathers.
Another design by the same hairdresser
is for evening. It is composed of light
rolls of hair, which end over the fore
head in small curls. On the top of the
head, slightly on tho Â»ight, is a large
curl, in which is set a spray of yellow
acacia mixed with rolls; on the left side
i is a jewel, which holds two loops of rib
1 bon cut to a point. In the center is a
; tall ostrich ffather. and a branch of aca-
I cia falls down over the waved hair be

always "taking the very lowest estimate,
not including those dowers under $50,000,
and naturally overlooking many alliances
so quietly made that the most lynx-eyed
newspapers failed to record them."
One interesting fact still remains evi
dent. Fifty years ago it was the rare
American woman who selected a hus
band of another nationality than her
own, and then she did so frankly for
purely ambitious motives. Before the
Civil War, when a millionaire's daughter
captured a count or prince, the whole
country rang with the news, and senti
ment was entirely unacknowledged on
either side. The agreement was so much
money for a title and position at Euro
pean courts, and because American for
tunes were not so large nor so numerous
as at present the international marriages
were less frequent. The number of these
alliances increases every year, the dots
grow larger and larger, and yet I find an
increasing per cent of love matches.
This last is a mitigating circumstance
in what every patriotic American is bound
to regard as an existing evil. To balance
against the rather cold-blooded alliances
made in the past five years between
American women and a couple of English
dukes, a French count and several Brit
ish earls, who actually knocked down
their coronets to the highest bidders, we
have Miss Endicott's love matcn with Jo
seph Chamberlain, Miss Brown's penniless
beauty winning the heart of Lady Aber
deen's brother, and Lady Vernon Har
court's conquest, by no golden enchant
ments, of England's great political leader.
Still, money remains the great link be
tween our women and the foreign men
who, as time goes on, have steadily raised
the prices ot their empty titles, until the
limit was reached at the $10,000,000 mark,

bom .. â â ;- of roses in garlands. The dress
is Princess shape behind, and at the sides,
and is made in one piece from top to bot
tom. The center of the back is of frilled
mousseline de sole, encircled on each side
by the taffetas.
The skirt is round, and made with a
train, and opens slightly down the front
over a panel of frilled mousseline de sole.
The front of the upper part is in Louis
XV style, opening wide over the nrnus
seline de sole, which is made of one piece
all down without a waist. It is cut rather
low at the neck and the decollete trimmed
with a hanging collar of mousseline de
sole edged with a double ruche of tne
same material. Down the front is a
flounce of the same headed by a -ruche,
and on each side are also flounces forming
cascades, which come down to the ground
and turn round the sides and behind. On
each siae of the front are scarfs of gui
pure starting from the shoulder and fail
ing in draped pleats below the waist.
The corsage is fixed behind by a waist
band of black velvet, which stops be
neath the arms and has a round strass
buckle at eac. end. The sleeves are half
length, coming just below the elbow, and
are rather wide, draped and gathered,
and are confined to the arm by a frilling
of pink mousseiine de sole.
FOR THE BUSINESS WOMAN.
THE woman who earns her own
clothes is very liable to become
careless about them as she is tired
when she goes home, and the needle
gets to be an unused instrument. Yet it
is a wonder how much can be accom
plished by an hour's sewing a day, and
being an entire change of employment it
is really a rest.
If a work-basket is arranged with
needles and scissors and everything
handy half the task will disappear. A
pretty basket can be arranged on a bam
boo tripod. When buttons come off or
facings are ragged it will prove invalu
able.
For a "best" dress that will be very in
expensive, a cheap summer silk, at from
twenty-five to fifty cents, if well chosen,
makes up very prettily and will last more
than a season. These cheap silks have
little body and unless well lined become
quickly limp. Interline tne entire skirt
with fiber chamois, which will give it the
appearance and the wear of heavy silk.
A dressmaker will faint at the idea, but J
know from experience that it is all right,
and if you try it you will say so and be
surprised at the effect. No haircloth is
used with the fiber chamois, which Is in
expensive and comes in both dark and
light shades. You can choose from three
heir to nothing bigger than a worthless |
marquisate. That is the largest cash pay
ment my book vouches for, though there
are fifteen names set opposite the $2,000,
000 mark, one leading off with $5,000,000,
while New Orleans alone, in dots of from
$200,000 to $500,000, has contributed $1,500,
000 to the big sum total I mentioned be
fore.
Now, the fact of the matter is that a
French, Italian or German bachelor who
has a title that Is old and estimated
highly at the court of his country has
absolutely placed his minimum price at
$100,000. A shrewd New York lawyer
found this out when his daughter's hand
was asked for by a French marquis
whose name is respected amon^j the
remnant of French aristocracy. The
{ honest man of law, previously instructed I
! by his wife and daughter, accepted the
I Marquis kindly, and mentioned that to
every one of his daughters he gave a
check for $25,000 by way of a housekeep
er's nest egg.
The marquis applauded this generosity,
I but announced that the engagement
j might be considered off unless the nest egg
was accompanied by three more of exact
ly the same size. There was a display of
paternal wrath, and the well-shod pater
nal boot, but the marquis never flinched,
and at the proper time both bride and
dower were forthcoming, though the
j three remaining daughters went penniless
I to their untitled American husbands. Of
! all this impressive amount of money that
has passed across the water England has
received more than one-half the total and
more women from New York State and
city have made foreign marriages than
from any other part of the country.
The bitterest pill, however, tLo.i this
driver among figures has rolled up for
American digestion is the assertion, based

is the most graceful and with the fiber
chamois inter. ming keeps In shape, but
without even when well lined is inclined i
to stretch in places and hang unevenly
after a little wear.
The 6econd is the bell-shaped, fitting
tightly over the hips and below the knees
flaring into a deep flounce. Another id
perfectly plain, gored, fitted carefully over
the hips anrt not ftarfng noticeably at the
bottom. This last is the more preferable
for a summer silk, and finished with two
or three ruffles, bound with baby velvet
ribbon, makes a very pretty skirt, i ue
bodice has a high standing collar of vel
vet with tiny tucks stitched in a contrast
ing color of silk. The stock in them is
caught at the sides of the front, which is
faced with baby velvet ribbon. If you
have an old lace collar It can be cut out
and appliqued onto the waist in the style
so much used. Sashes are used very
much and give a grace to a soft dress
which is very enective.
For office or store wear, however, any
thing which will become flimsy or has a
"dressy" effect is out of place In a large
establishment where scores of young wo
men were employed, the man at the head
told me how much he admired the shirt
waists and how much neater and more
becoming they were than the woolen
dresses which caught the dust.
They need not be cold either, if for a
corset cover an extra long-sleeved tight
fitting undervest is worn to take the place
of the warmer waist.
Bands for the sailor hat to harmonize
with the tie and belt are pretty and
these little accessories give to a shirt
waist as much if not more style than
many other costumes in an appropriate
place. Stocks are worn a great deal, and
are very effective and economical, worn
to cover entirely a light linen collar. A
third of a yard of taffeta silk will make
one. Make it about one and a half yards
long and three to five inches in width.
white taffeta ribbon at about 25 cents
a yard will wash very well, and can be
done in your room. Lay it out flat on
a marble basin, if you have one, if not
your ingenuity will find a substitute. Be
careful not to crease or rub in the hands
or the threads will pull and it will look
"washed." Rinse it carefully up and
down, and while quite wet stick it flat
onto a window or mirror, and when dry
trim the ends and you will be the only
one who will know it has boon washed.
All firmly, closely woven ribbon can be
washod in the same way. Stocks made
straightways of silk or sheer muslin
clean the same way. Made of white pique
they are pretty and can â  also be dried
without starch or ironing on a mirror
or marble table.
It is well that shoes are not expensive
in San Francisco; they wear out so very
fast. The cobblestones and hills make
thick-soled shoes a necessity for street
wear. Calfskin with kid tops are very
on personal investigation, that with rare
exceptions those women who marry out
of the States usually resign, and In too
brief a time, all Identity with and affec
tion for the land of their birth. It Is only
necessary to meet American wives of for
eign men to realize how closely the mar
riage tie binds them to the country of
their adoption, how rapidly they assume
the foreigner's reverence for those In high
places, the recognition of class and ac
cept the manners and customs that their
fathers or brothers would resist to their
last breath.
But If England, as the notebook records,
has got the lion's share of our American
millions France comes next on the list of
beneficiaries, Germany third, and It is
pleasant to find that Spain has drawn few
prizeÃ Indeed from among our rich and
pretty girls. It is true enough that of all
titled Europeans the Spaniard is least In
clined to make a mercenary or an alien
marriage, while the English and French
are the most aggressive In this particular.
In Paris, Indeed, there has recently
been opened a matrimonial bureau, where
a careful Vecord is made of the move
ments of those rich American women,
maids or widows, who are traveling on
the Continent. At the bureau a careful
estimate of the young lady's fortune, a
history of her family, etc., can be secured
and assistance received, with a view to
securing Introductions to desirable indi
viduals.

MEN'S FASHIONS.
MEW YORK, April 2.â A tendency
that grows with every year is to
allow men more and more variety j
in their choice of dress, especially |
at this season. For man, as well as J
woman, Easter is now recognized as be
ginning a period when new and gorgeous
buea may make their appearance. To be
sure h.e is and must always remain a
long way behind his sisters in this re
spect, but the young man who follows
London or even New York in selecting
his spring outfit will be permitted a
range of colors that would put to shame
Joseph's celebrated attire.
To begin at the beginning, which is un
derwear. The kind that the fastidious
young man will wear this spring is dark
in color, seal brown or blue, with a fine
horizontal line of white or green or dull
red. Its material will be governed by his
means, and may be anything from fine
I cotton to silk.
The individual who designs hosiery has
let his fancy run free, and there is a be
wildering array of checks, stripes and
dots in every possible combination. Some
men insist on clinging to plain and mod-
I est black, and their taste can never be
called in question. Still there is no rea
son why a man should not indulge his
artistic taste in the selection of hose if
he will do it in moderation. A good rule
to follow is never to wear hosiery that
will compel the gaze, if by chance it be
comes exposed to view. With a woman
it may be different, but a man's lowpr
extremities are seldom so pleasing to the
eye that he can afford to call attention
to them.
In shirts the greatest range of color is
allowed. Last season London set the
bold example of wide, contrasting stripes
running across the bosom, and the fash
ionable shlrtmakers are showing cloths
of similar design this spring. But the
prison stripe h/is taken in this country
only with the r-porting fraternity, fad
dists, and men who order their shirts by
the dozen. The modest man still prefers
a lengthwise stripe of blue, red or helio
trope, in which plenty of variety of pat
terns can be found.
In selecting a spring suit a man should
be governed somewhat by c.onsj-.eration
of the extent of his wardrobe. If it is
books, bonbons and such gifts as the
Parisian has come to find are requisite
sacrifices at the altar of American beau
ty and weath.
In case marriage should reward these
purely business-like maneuvers anu In
vestments the bureau exacts a stately
Interest, plus the money Invested In the
scheme, and so implicit is the Parisian
belief that faint heart ne'er won fair
lady, and American capital is worth
fighting for, that at the expense of the
bureau as many as three or four men
are sent over to New York, âoston and
Chicago every season, allowed to put up
at the best hotels, given money to spend,
horses, to ride and clothes befitting their
titles, on the chance of their winning a
bride out of whose capacious purse a
full compensation for the investment can
be paid.
Women who are fond of strong per
fumes should remember that they are de
cidedly Injurious to the sense of smell.
By their frequent use the secretory
glands of the nose and throat are over
taxed and weakened. One day the per
son notices that the hearing is less acute
than usual and the sense of smell seems
defective. This is, of course, put down
to a cold and but little is thought of it.
After a time the entire head becomes af
fected, and there follow throat and lung
complications which are likely to end in
chronic, if not fatal, illness. Smelling
salts are a prolific cause of deafness: all
strong and pungent odors, particularly
those which act on the secretory pro
cesses, should be avoided as far as pos
sible.
The Soudan expedition, while engaged
in laying the new Nile railway, has seen
some remarkable mirages. From a dis
tance the men appeared to oe working
into a beautiful lake, and on all sides
were .to be seen beautifully wooded hills,
ships and cascades. When looked at
through field-glasses the Illusion was
heightened rather than diminished.
limited and he is under the necessity of
wearing the same suit several days in
the week, he would do well to avoid cer
tain patterns which, though attractive in
themselves, become prominent by too fre
quent wearing. It is Inconvenient for a
man if his friends and fellow-citizens can
always identify him by his clothes.
The prevailing shades for business suits
are brown and gray, which are to be had
in close checks, loose checks and plain
mixtures.
They come in both rough and smooth
finish, but in the lighter cloths intended
for summer wear smooth goods seem to
be reasserting their supremacy. The sack
suit should be made up with three but
tons, and only the two lower side pockets.
The little change pocket has followed the
upper breast pocket Into oblivion. Coats
are cut to medium length, not quite as
abbreviated as last year.
A novelty that some of the extremists
have adopted .or sack and cutaway suits
is a rough Scotch cioth known as heather,
which feels as coarse as a bran bag. It
is seen in loose checks of striking dimen
sions, for it Is a London invention. They
will probably last no more than a month
or two.
Another new thing which was foreshad
owed last fall consists of indistinct stripes
âperhaps a quarter of an inch wide. In
this combination there should be no con
trast, and the nearer the two shades ap
proximate the better.
The blacks with very thin red or white
lines, that were worn last fall, are dis
tinctly out of date, but the stripe effect
can be had in plain black by means of a
fine rib. It produces a neat effect when
made up in French worsteds. But the
rib should not be too pronounced.
The cutaway, as a semi-dress garment,
has had its day. It is now designed for
morning wear, and is made up in the
same materials as sacks. The only ap
propriate coat for street dress wear is
the firock, which is still made in soft
vicunas and unfinished worsteds. The
trousers to go with it should be of light
color, with a wide and unobtrusive stripe.
The very newest tie is a silk ascot with
flowing ends. It is unlined, and to be
effectively tied must be of fine material.
It is tied like an ascot, except that in
stead of crossing the ends at the finish,
one end is folded over and the other is
brought over and spread across it so that
only that one end slows. Then it is per
mitted to fall straight down and is neld
in place by a pinâ a small pearl is the
approved thing. This or the ordinary as
MEN'S FASHIONS FOR SPRING.
cot is the only correct form for a frock
coat.
Ascots in colors are worn with sack
suits as well. The four-in-hand persists
as it has for years, but the scarf with
flowing ends, known as the imperial, has
the call just now. It is tied in a close
knot, and may be worn with the high
turn-down collar as well as with the ordi
nary stand-up kind. The other kind of
tie that will be worn is the string, which
has found popular favor because it re
veals the beauties of a handsome shirt
to advantage.
The high turndown collar should have
straight edges or corners gently rounded.
The edges of this and the plain standing
collar should fit closely together in front.
The new derby hat is made with fuller
crown and a little more ample curl of
brim than the style of a year ago. The
proper shades are seal brown, or, of
course, black. Every year about this
time the little round-topped London,
derby makes its appearance on our
streets, but sensible Americans, refuse to
take kindly to it. For variation with the
derby the Alpine is always appropriate in
the spring and autumn, but the fastidi
ous man will not wear the gray with
black band- Either a pearl, with pearl
band, or a light brown is in better taste.
The particular young man will exercise
care in the selection of his shoes. The
razor toe Is an exiled abomination, but
the extremely blunt bulldog shape is little
better. A medium rounded toe, with a
cap of generous length, is the most satis
factory-
The proper thing in spring gloves is a
reddish shade of kid. Edam cheese comes
nearest to meeting it of any thing I know.
Golf and bicycling have become such
popular sports in America that they have
come to require a distinctive dress. The
proper outfit for the lf<9B golfer is a black
sack coat, breeches of pronounced plaid
or check and plain brown stockings, with
French plaid tops. The cap should be
made to match the breeches or in har
mony with them. As golf attire is worn
off the links as well as on in the country,
a soft shirt of French muslin or percale
with a stock tie will complete the cos
tume nicely.
About the only new thing offered to
bicyclists this season is In sweaters;
which have developed into much more
dressy garments than formerly. They
are made in green or red or brown, with
white stripes about the wrists and collar
and lace up in front.

frame beautifully carved' in acorns and oak j
leaves. A large mahogany chair of an- |
tique design, the work of Miss Blind, was ;
especially noticed. The drapons 1 heads In I
thÂ« arms and legs were splendidly carved and
showed that the young lady possesses much j
talent in her line of work.
â¢ Perhaps the most ambitious attempts In the
woodcarvtng class were the beautiful cabinet,
five by six feet, with inlaid head uiece. the
work of Miss Morse, and the seven-foot ma
hogany Colonial clock, on which Miss Johns
has been working for months.
According to Mr. Bush, principal of the
Polytechnic High School, all the students In
the drawing, modeling, carving, woodworking !
and Iron-bending classes were at the beginning ]
of this year obliged to sign a contract to the j
effect that they would give the result of at j
least ten hours' work to the school, â¢ which |
seems only fair and right, considering the ben
efit and training they receive so long Tree of
charge. Last year two of the students hired
a . room In the city in which to exhibit their |
woodcarving, â  the result of their year's work, ;
and sold the latter for $300.
And so all these Industrial classes will here- j
after contribute to the beautifying of the i
school. In the Iron-bending department beau- |
tiful hanging lanterns, candelabra, single can
dlesticks, vases, " picture, frames, grills, tea
kettle stands, etc.. were exhibited, and some
of the students have already framed pictures
In the various rooms and furnished brackets of
delicate Iron tracery for the wooden shelves,
made In the wood shops, whereon are i placed |
busts or statues from the students In model-
Ing.
It Is, furthermore. Mr. Bush's Idea to carry
out 6Uch a plan as was set forth In these* col
umns a few weeks ago. Certain rooms will be
dedicated to certain classes of pictures and
ornamentation. For Instance, In the English
room there will be pictures and statues of
famous men and scenes renowned In English
literature; the history roam will be decorated
with views of noted places and objects all over
the world, and thus, with such groupings, the
student's Interest will he far more greatly
ar. 'Used and entertained th;in by a mere hetero
geneous collection of pictures and busts.
Some of the pictures for this purpose In the
drawing department, the work of both young
men and women, are almost completed. One
scene for the history nvom Is enlarged from a
photograph of the Temple of Karnak, and Is
a splendid piece of work. Another Is a beau
tiful view of the Alhambra. Mr. Bush Is to
be congratulated on the successful beginning of
his undertaking.
CHILD STUDY FOR TEACHERS.
Teachers ought to begin child study in con
nection with a pedajfOKical note book. Form
the habit of recording: your professional ex
perience every day. Reserve from five min
utes to an hour a day for this purpose. Let
your virtues In recording be continuity and
patience. If you want convenient headings In
your notes use such as curriculum, or course
of study, programme, method, discipline.

The movement to secure headquarters
for the order where all the city lodges
could meet and where the grand" officers
could have quarters has failed, because
of the want of unanimity on the part of
the city lodges to take steps in that di
rection. Two meetings were held. At the
first but eleven of the thirty-one lodges
were represented and at the second there
was but a small Increase of representa
tives. It appears that instead of having
a building as prominent as some of the
orders In this city have the Workmen
are content to remain in independent
lodgeruoms In all parts of the city and to
have the office of the grand officers in
a back suite of rooms in a large build
ing which no visiting member of the or
uer can find without being directed by
the elevator man.
Prosperity Lodge on last Tuesday
night had three initiations and during the
evening presented to its district deputy,
M. J. Blackmail, a set of beautifully en
grossed and framed resolutions express

The representatives from Memorial
Lodge of this city to the Grand Lodge are

F. McN'aughton.
The Grand Lodge will commence Its
session on Tuesday next and it will
probably be the most exciting one that
has been held in this city for years. There
will be a great contest for the high offi

MISS PARMETER COMPLIMENTED.
On the recent resignation of Miss Parmeter
of Chlco, President Ritter and the faculty of
the State Normal School In that city unani

| "Past Dictators' and Dictators' Associa
; tion of the Knights of Honor."
At the joint meeting of the grand trus
; tees and the finance committee to be held
| in the grand reporter's office next
I Wednesday night matters of great im
! portance to the entire jurisdiction will be
discussed.
The supreme reporter's list for April
shows Iff) deaths, of which six occurred
in California. These will all be paid dur
ing the current month.
The Supreme Court of Appeals oC the
State of Virginia has Just decided a
case Brought against the order to recover
the amount of insurance of one Peters,
who died when not in good standing. It
was shown that under the constitution
the member was suspended for non-pay
ment of assessment and died before being
reinstated, but that after the day on
which payment should have been made
he paid some money on account of the
assessment, for the non-payment of
which he was suspended. It was claimed
for the beneficiaries that the habit of re
ceiving assessments after the end of the
month by the financial reporter consti
tuted a waiver by the order of Its right
to exact compliance with the rule, and
estopped it from claiming forfeiture. It
was shown that the Suprenv- Lodge had
been apprised of Peters' suspension, hut
It did not appear that it was aware of the
practice prevailing of receiving assess
ments Â«fter the close of the month. The
court decided in favor nf the order and
held that while thp financial reporter is
the agent of his particular lodge, he is
not the apent of the Supreme Lodge, and
that no implied waiver cn.n arise from the
conduct of the financial reporter. This
fixes the rule that the laws ol the order
must be strictly lived up to.
B'NE B'RITH.
The movement for the advancement of
the proposition to rehabilitate the youths'

THE MAN WHO
WILL LEAD OUR ARMY.
Continued from Page 17.
It was but a short time, however, be
fore fate and Miles' achievements re
versed the action of the Massachusetts
Governor. iseiore he had been long
in active service Miles was made a cap
tain, then a colonel, later a brigadier
general and anally a major-general.
General Hancock, under whom he
served in the early years of the wai,
quickly discovered his abilities, and was
the more interested in the young man
because of the fact that Miles had not
been graduated from West .foun.. He
was in charge of Hancock's skirmish
line at Chancellorsville and held his
own successfully against every attack
by Lee's veterans, in this duty he was.
seriousjy wounded on the second day,
and General Hancock, in a letter to
Washington urging his promotion, said,
"If Colonel Miles lives he will be one or
the most distinguished officers in the
service."
Fifteen years later General Hancock
wrote to President Hayes recommend
ing that Brevet Major-General Miles be
promoted to brigadier-general in the
regular army. In that letter General
Hancock declared that during the Wil
derness campaign Miles "totrk a promi
nent part and was distinguished
throughout that historic campaign for
brilliant services and able and gallant
conduct." oeneral Hanci/ck added that
Miles has been highly recommended by
him for these qualities in his official re
ports.
As for General Miles' service during
the closing months of the civil war, his
friends point to the fact that in Feb
ruary, lst>s, when he was but twenty
six years old, he commanded the Sec
ond Army Corps, to which distinction
he had risen by successive promotions
for brilliant and daring work while he
had commanded regiments, brigades
and division under General Grant.
Never before, they declare, had an
American officer at that age com
manded so large a body of soldiers.
They also take pride in the fact that
when General Lee surrendered at Ap
pomattox, two months later, Miles was
in command of the First Division of
the Second Army Corps, the largest of
all the divisions in the Army of the Po
tomac.
But it is as an Indian fighter that the
world best knows Generai Miles. His
work on the . frontier is familiar to
every reader of American history and
has been made so much more promi
nent than were his achievements dur
ing the civil war that many seem to
forget the services he performed during
that conflict. Of his six years' work
among the Indians General Miles says
in his book of reminiscences:
"A belt of country extending from
the Rio Grande, or the Mexican border,
on the south to the Canadian boundary
on the north and averaging scrme four
hundred miles in width from east to
west was redeemed from a wild state
and its control by savage tribes and,
given to civilization. This vast coun
try, over which in 1574 roamed power
ful bands of Indian warriors and
countless numbers of wild game, was in
six years by the operations of the
United States army freed for all time
from the desolating influence of the
savage and made habitable for civilized
man. And these results are due to the
heroic services, the splendid fortitude
and courage and noble sacrifices of men
like Lewis. Custer, Thornburtrh, Hale,
Bennett, Keogh, Yates, 'Tom' Custer,
Crittenden, Blddle, McKinney Lad hun
dreds of others, officers and soldiers,
who* placed themselves between war
and peace, between danger and secur
ity, guarding the newly constructed
railways and protecting the towns as
they rode on the plains. They freely
offered their lives and actually cleared
this vast region during that brief time,
giving it to civilization forever. '
And in this important work, as Gen
eral Miles modestly refrains from even
intimating, the present head of the
United States army was the one who
made the plans, and he was the main
directing force in the operations.
Since his active life on the frontier
General Miles has become conspicuous
as a man of peace. Not only has he
written a book, but he long has been
in great demand as an after-dinner
speaker. He is at his ease always,
quiet and reserved when the occasion
calls for a dignified bearing, demo
cratic and frank when the display of
those qualities is in order.
earnest efforts in this direction are most need
ed. In two years we have reduced the ab
sences by 6963 days. We should reduce it as
much more this year. Last year there were
over 24,000 absent days reported to this of
fice. This should be reduced to 10.00 Cor less.
Will we do It? That depends entirely upon
j the efforts of each individual teacher.
The Increased attendance during the past
I two years saved the county several thousand
dollars, and this year we should do better and
save more. Individual districts will have
much more money if the average daily attend-
I ance is high. Impress this on patrons and
i pupils. Visit the parents of irregular pupils,
and strive by every means to gel them with
you in this work. J. S. McPHAILL.

A PEDAGOGICAL QUESTION.
A pamphlet entitled "A Pedagogical Ques
tion" has lately been issued by W. C. Doub.
A. 8., of Stanford, nt>w engaged in teaching
at Bakersfield. Cal. His subject Is ably han
dled, and perusal will greatly repay the teach
ers of our State. A few extracts are taJcen
here and there.
"Does our public school system exist for our
school children or our school, children for our
public school system?" Is the pedagogical ques
tion which Mr. Doub puts before the public.
He remarks that, in answer to this query,
most people would maintain that the object
of our public schools is to make good citizens
of our boys and girls; but. while admitting thl9
primary object, he desires to point out some
things wherein it falls to accomplish this, and
indicates some lines of improvement.
By statistics Mr. Doub proves that nine
tenths of those who enter the grammar school
never enter the high school, and that only two
children out of every one hundred of our gram
mar students graduate from the universities.
Granting that the public money expended on
higher education is well expended, how about
this 38 per cent who never graduate from the
university, and this 90 per cent who never enter
the hieh school ? If our prescribed course of
grammar school work, which has for Its main
object entrance into the high school, and ourpre
scribed course of high school work, which has
for its main object entrance into the university,
are the best courses to make good citizens of
this large per cent who never enter the uni
versity, then, of course, nothing can be said
against our present system of graded educa
tion. But is this true? In so far as California
is concerned, 1 think not: and if not, then in
so far as many of our school children are con
cerned, they exist for our public school system,
and it does not exist for them.
Mr. Doub then writes that. In his opinion,
three of the most Important requisites of a
good citizen consist in the power to make him
self-supporting, independent; in a willingness
to foster our Institutions; and In the ability to
WHIST
WHIST INTERVIEW WITH MILTON C.
WORK.
We know that every one of our whist readers
will be delighted to know the opinion that Mr.
Work formed of our whist play. We asked
Mr. Work this question:
"Will you state for the benefit of our whist
players your candid opinion as far as you can
Judge of the quality of our whist as you saw
it In the Rideout trophy contest?"
Answerâ When I came to San Francisco I
was very anxious to meet the expert whisters
of California, in order that I might compare
their skill at the table with the experts from
other sections of the country, most, if not all,
of whom it has been my good fortune to meet
in the various league contests of the last half
dozen years. I can candidly say that I am
greatly surprised to find the standard of ex
pert play as high upon the Pacific Coast as it
undoubtedly is. I had rather imagined that
while the district contained many good whist
players, that owing to the fact that geograph
ical conditions had prevented the residents 6t
this locality from meeting the crack teams of
the East ami Middle West, the opportunity to
improve gained by such contests being lack-
Ing, the play of the Californians would hardly
equal the average among the crack teams of
the league. On the contrary, as well as I am
able to compare from the experience I have
had I should say that with the exception of
three or four of the strongest quartets ever
gotten together by league clubs, a picked
team from San Francisco should be able to
play on equal terms and with an equal chance
of success with any other league team.
I believe that the best four in this city (San
Francisco) is stronger to-day than three of
the six teams that have captured the Ham
ilton trophy, and than three of the four teams
that have captured the American Whist
League trophy at the meetings of the various
league congresses. Compared with the weekly
matches fcr the American Whist League tro
phy which take place in the East, and in over
thirty of which it has been my fortune to par
ticipate, I should say that two-thirds of
the adversaries that we have met in such
matches were less formidable than a team
from this city would be. I hear with the
greatest pleasure that there is some talk of
sending a San Francisco team to the next
congress, and most earnestly hope that the
plan will be carried out. I feel satisfied that
thp team would make a record at the whist
table of which both the players and the section
that they represent would have every reason
to be proud, but the sending of such a team
would establish a far better record than any
ever made by the play of the cards, namely,
a conclusive proof of energy and love of
whist. If a quartet of players be sent such
a distance to enter a congress they would be
received with the greatest enthusiasm, and I
believe that their example in taking such a
trip would be of the greatest benefit to the
game, not only along the Pacific, but all over
the country-

"PRIVATE CONVENTIONS IN WHIST."
We think it Is very bad gra~ce for the whist
editor of the New York Sun to be preaching
through the columns of that paper on
the morality of "Private Conventions," " and
making accusations against others for the pur
pose of trying to shield his own shortcomings.
In a recent article in that journal, with big
head llnee, "Discussion of the Propriety of
Private Conventions," he says:
"The propriety of private conventions seems
still to be the chief topic among whist players,
and several of the most prominent are putting
their opinions on record. The Sun is daily in
receipt of letters commending the stand it has
taken against these doings, and the national
and State organizations have both passed reso
lutions condemning them.
In spite of all that has been said on the sub
ject, there are still some persons who insist
that everything is fair that can be done with
cards, and thai no explanations are due to
any one. Tormey thinks it would be best
to let every one play as he pleases, and to
allow each team to Invent and uxe any sys
tem of signals that their ingenuity might de
vise, provided they did not make the signs
with their fingers or by movements in their
chairs."
We would like to ask what sort of "a pri
vate convention" the whist editor of the Sun
used at the Put-in-Bay Congress, that caused
him to be summoned before the executive com
mittee to explain, which act came mighty near
causing his expulsion from the American
Whist League?
PLAY CONSERVATIVE WHIST AS A RULE
One of the most difficult points In whist is
the decision whether or not to lead from four
trumps, after your own or your partner's suit
Is established, or virtually established. Tha
average i>layer is too ready to lead trumps
under such circumstances. Almost invariably
four trumps or more are massed In one hand
against you, and the attempt to establish the
suit results in a Waterloo. Speaking gener
ally, the wisest plan Is to try to get at least
one force on the enemy before trying to ex
haust his trumps, when you have but four.
Note the words above, "speaking generally."
Every hand has its own answer in this matter.
There is no possibility of laying down a gen
eral rule; but the conservative play, in case
of doubt, will win the most tricks in the lon*
run. â Wheelock's Weekly.

"Life Is not unlike a game of whist. Some

VERSION OF
"THE FIRST BORN."
If "The Cat and the Cherub" had not ;
pone into the vaudeville by mess and
come to skim the milky way of Anna
â  Held, I suppose we never would have
had the opportunity of finding out for
ourselves just what is the relationship
between the Chinatown melodrama of
Chester Bailey Fernald and the China
town melodrama of Francis Powers.
For the Chinatown play has had its
nine' days' wondership and is gone from
tho fads of men. In London, where
time runs an easy tires and "Charley's
Aunt," celebrating its fifteen hun
dredth performance is reckoned in the
very flower of its first run. "The Cat :
and the Cherub" may still be taken in :
by tourists and strangers. Over here
Chinatown has been wi^ed off the dra- j
matic map. The punk, the tomtom and
the hatchet-man are among the deadâ
among the lately dead, the deadest of
'â¢â all.
â¢ â¢ â¢
But. while It may not be meet to ag- j
pravate the post-mortem with a com- .
â¢plete comparative study of the values, I
absurdities and plagiarisms of the two â 
P-lays, I cannot, on the other hand, let
pass tho one serious dramatic present- j
ation we have had in months. Having
r^ad Mr. Fernald's newspaper commun
libation, in which he pleads not guilty
â¢â¢â¢ of the Baldwin production of his play.
; and having witnessed tho play a Bee
: ond time and made every human al
lowance for the impotency of its enact
.-. nient. I feel it in me to be marvelously
just in writing about it. I have even
. gone to the labor of familiarizing my
self with Mr. Fornald's book of China
town sketches, from the title of one of
. which he gets the title of his playâ "The
Cat and the Cherub." You may have
noticed that this title has nothing to
do with the play itself. It has as lit
tie to do with this play as the play
has to do with Mr. Fernald's stories.
Had Mr. Fernald dramatized any or all
of his own stories he could never have*
accused Mr. Powers of plagiarizing him.
. In applying the title of one of them
to this Chinatown play, Mr. Fernald
makes a delicate protest against Mr.
Powers, offers him an ingenious re
minder that he is not the only Colum
bus that Chinatown ever knew. And
If you have the acquaintance of Mr.
Fernald's book you must admit that ;
.the verbal characteristics of Mr. Pow- :
ers' learned doctor are, to a certain
extent, inspired by those of a similar
personage in the book. Several little
touchesâ like, say. the doctor's super- i
stitious allusion to the spots on his fin- '
ger nails and the appellation, - 'Chu
chu monster," applied to a locomotive
â are notoriously in, and doubtless sug- !
pasted to Powers by, the book. How
ever, they are hardly the exclusive in- ,
ventlon of Mr. Fernald, the "Choo- ,
choo" idea, for one, having been elab- i
orately presaged many years ago by ,
the Chinese who saw his first cable car !
and exclaimed, "No pushee, no pullee,
go like hellee all samee'." But the stage
atmosphere of "The Cat and the Che- j
rub," its instrumentation (if I may so
phrase), divisions and developments are
emphatically after Powersâ and, for ail j
of Fernald's happy metaphor and other |
literary accomplishment, a long, long
way after in point of theatrical effec
tiveness.
â¢ â¢ â¢
I grant you tfiat Powers must have
read the Fernald book before writing
"The F.rst Born ; that its sketches,:
most likely, sent him dreaming through
the tunnels and alleys of CUlnatown.
go handy round the comer â neverthe
less, his play is more his own than
'Macbeth" is Shakespeare's. And it is i
this Powers' play, not the Century sto
ries, which Mr. Fernald has dramatized !
under title of "The Cat and the Cher
ub," Just as Richard Le Gallienne re
arranged Edward Fitzgerald, calling
the job Le Gallienne's "Omar Khay
yam."
â¢ â¢ â¢
The ending of Mr. Fernald's version
Jp splendidly grim and fascinating, but
kept from its full strength by bad play- i
wrighting, c-r too many literary flour
ishes â it amounts to the same in this
instance. The time has come when
vengeance will claim its ownâ you feel
it. The doctor and his son's murderer
sit side by side on the benchâ the same
bench where they had sat in the open
ing of the piece. And because it is the
same bench and the same characters,
Mr. Fernald must need exploit the "re
current theme," repeat the opening re
marks about retribution, while" his au
dience fidgets for the vengeance de
tained. The approach has made inev
itable the murderer's doom; nothing re
mains but the deed, to be done in de- !
cent leisurellness, if you like, but with
enough celerity not to lose you the

; idea that perhaps the learned doctor is
going to talk his victim to death.
This final scene is to be deplored at
length because so fir as the mode of
the killing i .rcerned it is original
with Mr. Fernald and altogether it Is
a wonderfi 1 scene gone somewhat
wrong. It is so wonderful, In fact, that
David Belasco no b oner saw it than
he incorporated it in the London pro
duction of "Tbe First Born"â as fine a
compliment as Belasco ever paid to any
author.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The res of "The Cat and the Cherub"
is so constructed as to stan'' 1 even less
serious criticism than Powers' play.
Powers' crudities, resulting from an in
genuous disregard of the cant as well
as the vital tricks of playwriting, were
often fortunate. They were the result
of a complete technical trustfulness
rather than too great knowledge of the
cheap tricks of cheap playwriters. Fer
nald. on the other hand, knows too
banally much. Into the tense, tragic
atmosphere of the Chinatown play he ]
has introduced all the puny devices of
English melodrama â from the now-you
see-lt-and-now-you-don't trapdoor to
the long-lost Drury Lane soliloquy, to
the dark -*delphi aside. There Is even
a touch of British comic relief In the
love scene, and the villain gives an
accurate forecast of what he Is about
to do next at punctual intervals
throughout the play. Xo wonder the
solid British public preferred "The Cat
and the Cherub."
* â¢ *
Even with good acting and careful
staging I do not see that these struct
ural crimes could be concealed, no more
than I can believe that the bad acting
and sloppy staging at the Baldwin are
responsible for the resemblances to
Powers' play. Perhaps it is too much
to expect the Anna Held outfit to be
supplied with sixty-four quarts of pure
milk daily and real actors too. But j
since Mile. Held's little side show turns
out to be the least valuable part of the j
triple bill, the quality of the acting is i
to be indignantly regretted by persons
who patronize the Baldwin on the as
sumption that it is a first-class theater.
Mr. Fernald unquestionably is getting
worse than he deserves in the acting of '
"The Cat and the Cherub," and by his ;
own confession he gathers no royalties j
on the performance. With a perfect j

We may thank William Greenbaum
for a fortnight of novel entertainment
which will be given in the Baldwin
some time this month. It will be re
membered that the wife of Lechaume,
the pianist, is no less person than Pilar
Morin, the pantomime artiste, who
startled New York several seasons ago
with her disrobing act in "Orange Blos
soms," and who lately has been appear
ing at the Waldorf-Astoria in several
pantomimic productions. Through Le
chaume Mr. Greenbaum has made ar
rangements by which Pilar Morin, Ma
dame Severine (another silent actress
of reputation) and the original Wal
dorf-Astoria company will appear here
in "In Old Japan," a mute tragedy by
Vance Thompson, the music by Le
chaume. This piece occupies about an
hour in the playing, and the one in
tended for the second week, "The Dres
den Shepherdess," about the same
length of time: so the balance of the
entertainment will be supplied by Fritz
Scheel and a full orchestra, in such
pieces as Tschaikowski's "Pathetic
Symphony" and Moszkowski's "Joan of
Arc" suite. The whole scheme is es
sentially artistic, and, to a certain ex
tent, exclusive, and should attract first
class audiences. It will be a rare sen
sation to witness a mute show wherein
subtle pose and eloquent movement are
the only language: for pantomine is al
most of the lost arts.
The Del Conte Opera Company has

tern of subordinating the music of the
lines to naturalism, says that the in
terpretation is good, but bound by
hard and fast English traditions. The
National Zeitung makes a comparison
that is of interest to us: "Those who
have seen Edwin Booth will not be
able to place Mr. Forbes Robertson
among the first rank of English dra
matic artists. He succeeds in single
passages In much that is full of intel
lect, interest and temperament. The
renowned masters, such as Salvini, he
has studied with profit, but the fas
cination of personality and gift of or
iginality necessary to the central fig
ure in a representation claiming a high
measure of respect are lacking in him."
â¢ Although he has directed that every
courtesy shall be extended to Forbes
Robertson and Mrs. Pat Campbell, the
Kaiser is said to be dubious as to the
wisdom of honoring them by his pres
ence at the theater. The ostensible rea
son is that "Mrs. Tanqueray" belongs
to a class of play whose moral ten
dency has never found favor in German
households. What a quaint attitude
for the compatriots of Herr Sudermann,

Baldwin.
The only change in the Baldwin's
triple bill is in Anna Held's vaudeville
turn. She will learn several new songs
and use the animated music sheet,
scored with the heads of forty live col
ored citizens. "'A Gay Deceiver" will
continue to open the bill and "The Cat
I and the Cherub" to close it.
The following Monday night brings
the first production here of Hoyt's
latest farce. "A Stranger in New York."
This is the only one of the Hoyt pro
ductions in which the author and his
manager, Mr. McK.ee. are directly in
terested, the rest having been let out
on royalties. New York hotel life and
the cocktail habit are especial subjects
for satire in "A Stranger."
Among those to appear in the farce
&re Anna Boyd, Joe Coyne, Charles
Dungan. John Dudley. W. H. Hatter.
Harry Rogers, Steve MaJey, Sam Ma
rion, Minnie McEvoy, Minnie Bridges.

California.
This evening the California Theater
will open its doors for the presentation
of the farce comedy "A Jay in New
York," by William Jerome and his
Herald-square comedians. "A Jay in
New York" is built for the purpose of
presenting a number of people in a
most becoming manner so as to allow
specialties, comedy sketches and hu
morous dialogue. Among the principal
members of the company are William
Jerome, W. C. Davies, Harry Taft,
Nick Conway, Maud Nugent, Thomas
H. Sedgwick, L. Grand, George A.
Crag, Robert North, Dave Hilton, Len
ora Wilson. Carrie Massoni, Bessie
Robbins and Clint Robbins. Maud Nu
gent, -who will appear in the role of
Daisy Day, is one of the best known
song writers in this country, her
songs, "Sweet Rosie O'Grady" and
"Mamie Reilly," being decidedly popu
lar compositions. Harry Taft, of the
company, is a wonderful boy whistler.
The Robbins are the originators of a
new school of wooden-shoe dancing.
The revival of "Old Lavender," by
author-actor Edward Harrigan at the
California Theater" on Sunday evening,
the 10th inst., undoubtedly will be
heartily welcomed. In the character
of Old Lavender Mr. Harrigan has al
ways scored a hit. It is among his
best, if not the best, of his impersona
tions. Dave Braham's songs will be
new to the young theater-goers and a
charm to the old-timers.
The Damrosch Grand Opera Company,
headed by the famous Melba, Is to ap
pear at the California for three nights
only, April 19, 21 and 23. The announce
ment of the coming of so important an
aggregation of lyric artists will cer
tainly tend to awaken universal opera
enthusiasm.
The announcement is made by Fried
lander. Gottlob & Marx that "Trilby"
will soon be put on at the California
by a specially organized company, and
at cheap prices.
TiVoli.
Commencing to-morrow night and
lasting five nights of Holy Week, the
Tivoli singers will appear in "The Bo
hemian Girl." Fernando Michelena is
specially engaged for the part of Thad
deus. Others of the cast are Edwin
Stevens, John Raffael, Phil Branson.
Duncan Smith. Florence Wolcott and
Irene Mull.
On Saturday evening the Easter bur
lesque which has been in preparation
for some time and is founded upon the
Arabian Nights' story of "Sinbad the
Sailor, ' will receive its initial presenta
tion. Ballets, specialties, songs, dances
gags, eccentricities, scenery, costumes
accessories and cast are promised in

Alcazar.
With to-morrow night's performance
of "Jane" the Alcazar revives one of its
most successful comedy properties. The
i piece needs no introduction, it always
, has been successful here, it was a very
] profitable venture for the Alcazar some
â  months ago and this revival of on*Â»
week should in a measure duplicate the
; other success.
Morosco's.
The most pretentious production that
has been attempted at Morosco's for
i some weeks will be, it is pledged, the
| elaborate revival of "Hands Across the
Sea," in which irry Mainhall plays
the leadipg role of John Dudley, the
young English farmer, who. leaving his
Devonshire home upon his honeymoon,
i is overtaken in Paris by the dire mis
fortune whlh is the usual fate of
heroes of the melodrama. Count Paul,
a French gamester, becomes infatuated
with Dudley's beautiful English bride
and is persuaded by the vjllair to de
; clare his love, which leads to an im
! portant scene in the gambling rooma
| of Mme. Valeric, where the presumptu
ous fop is chastised by the noble young
' husband. Immediately after the vil
lain murders Count Paul, imputing tho
crime to the hero, who is condemned by
the French courts; but his sentence is
afterward commuted to penal servi
tude for life at New Caledonia â whence
he escapes, naturc.y.
In the foi -th act the most important
setting of the play occurs, showing an
elaborate scene of the dock of a 6teamer
at sea. Dudley is rescued from an open
boat; the rescuing steamer is over
hauled by a French corvette and Dud
ley demanded. The British captain es
pouses his cause, and when the steam
er reaches the port of Sydney, Aus
tralia, the hero's innocence is fully es
tablished and a happy finale ensues.
W. L. Gleason has been specially en-
I gaged to supplement the regular com
| pany, of which Maud Edna Hall, Lor
ena Atwood, Queen Purssell, Fred But
| ler, Maurice Stewart, Landers Stevens
i and Mortimer Snow have been cast for
j important roles.
A new scene ot the harbor of Sydney
' is in preparation for this production.
Orpheum.
The bill at the Orpheum will l>a
strengthened this week by the addition
of four new acts, chief among which
! is Mile. Bartho the Parisian dancer,
who recently has been appearing at
| Koster & Bial's. She has an interna
tional reputation : s a danseuse, and
has on several occasions appeared as
premiere danseuse at the Folies Ber
gere, Paris. She will appear here in
transformation dre es. Another nov
elty of the bill will be Mandela, -who
styles himself the master of equipoise.
He is credited with doing some wonder
ful feats of balancing and juggling,
making his work the more difficult by
performing his act while on a revolving
globe. John W. West, known as the
"Musical Moke," will do an eccentric
musical turn, and Miriam Ainsworth,
Australian singing and dancing sou
brette, will appear in specialties.
The hold-overs include the Five
Whirlwinds, who are among the most
sensational acrobats that have yet ap
peared on the Orpheum circuit; Mont
gomery and Stone the acme of black
face business; the Glissandos and sev
eral others.
Ghytes.
The new bill in the Chutes Theater
is full of novelty, the only old feature
being Captain Carono.'s "African
Lion Hunt," one of the most thrilling
animal acts ever staged. Chiquita en
tertains every afternoon and evening,
and the zoo is open daily from 10 in the
morning to 11 at night.
Olvjmpia.
The Olympla Music Hall has a long
list of attractions to supplement the
selections by Kirchner's ladies' orches
tra. The vaudeville olio includes Mile.
Adelita, Spanish dancer; Clifford Jack
lin, tenor; Dolly Paxton, singing sou
brette; Mac Tunison, balladist; Inez
and Antoinette, Parisian danseusee,
and several others.
J^usic.
Most "testimony benefits" are im
positions and bores, both to the per
formers and patrons. But there are
exceptions now and then, a positive two
of which are the concerts to be given
at Sherman & Clay Hall on Wednesday
evening, the 13th inst., and the follow
ing Saturday afternoon in aid of Pletro
Marino, the young violinist of this city,
who is anxious to return to Brussels
and finish up his violin studies. If any
one here deserves a benefit it is young
Marino. He has exceptional talent, and
with a couple of years more of hard
work in the right atmosphere he is apt
to become a bri'iant artist. Mr. Green
baum, th(j secretary of the Symphony
Society, has the business end of the
concerts in hand, and Mrs. Carr, Mr.
Lent and Mr. Abramoff are among
those who have volunteered their pro
fessional services.
Albert Marks will bring a great musi
cal attraction to the coast in May, hav
ing made arrangements by which we
will hear the famous Kneisel String
Quartet, one of the finest organiza
tions of the kind in the world.
The tenth concert of the San Fran
cisco Symphony Society will take place
at the Tivoli on Thursday afternoon,
April 14. The change is owing to the
fact that the date originally announced
came in holy week.

THE LUMBER TRADE.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says of the
lumber trade:
The lumber trade for the past month has
been dull, and April opens with gloomy pros
pects. The fact Is that lumber dealers do not
Know what to do. The dry weather has set the
farmers back, and building all over the State
is dull. Lumber in the yards is scarce, but
retailers will not stock up for fear that there
will be no demand. Some dealers are more
hopeful. They claim that the California^ is
forever looking on the dark side and prog
nosticating dull times. But the world still
moves Men will build, and lumber must be
made, bought and sold. The foreign trade is
email, owlnc to the scarcity of vessels, but
the Alaska craze will settle down to legitimate
lines, and then there will lie vessels enough to
transport all the lumber needed to fill foreign
yards. The redwood men are at sea the same
as the pine, and are uneasy, but the only
thing to do Is to wait for something or other
to turn up.
The current market conditions all over the
States have been most peculiar this year, but
only In the West, In California especially, is
the lumber trade suffering to any great ex
tent. From the Middle West come reports of
heavy rains and accompanying overflows, but
the best of spring weather followed, and the
Blight setback was not felt. Eastern reports
place the business transacted so far in IS3S
far ahead of the similar months last yt-ar.
Boom Jocalltles are not cheerful, but the gen
eral trfne is prosperous.
In the extreme East summer orders are be
ginning and the spring lethargy is disappear
ing. Prices are hither and steadier in the
Wisconsin district and demands exacting. The
manufacturers have the "call"' and obtain
their rates.
The Northwest Is happy, logs scarce and
valuable, and the general lumber business is
profitable.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW ' YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 2.â News having an Im
portant bearing on â  the all-absorbing question
of this country's relations with Spain was ex
ceedingly scarce to-day, as Congress was not In
session. The absence of developments left the
situation much as It was when trading ceased
yesterday .afternoon, and when all classes of
owners were offering stocks for sale on the
presumption that war with Spain was- in
evitable. Yet prices show net gains to-day,
extending to over a point In many cases, and
the extreme recoveries from the lowest show
variations which compare favorably with the
violent changes of last Monday and Wednes
day. The market was exceedingly feverish and
erratic during all of , the two hours', session, in
spite of the varying news. Most of the activity
was baFeil on the supposition "the absence of
all symptoms . might itself be a symptom."
This uncertain state of affairs naturally begot
an Inclination to leave contract obligations out
standing. Most of the existing contracts' on
the exchange are based on short sales of stocks,
and '. the uncertainty found expression \in I buy-
Ing to cover. The. timidity of the shorts was
founded on their very severe experience last
Monday. They saw powerful support offered
to stem the downward tendency at the open
ing. The analogy was so close to the course |
of things last Saturday that It had an unset- ,
tling effect. Important commission business
with Washington connections were the Instru
ments used for much of the buying. This grave
the appearance, whether well founded or only ;
designed to seem so, of orders to buy stocks,
possibly on information obtained in Washing
ton on some favorable turn In the prospect of
affairs. This development or maneuver was not
lost upon the bears. It Is not improbable also
that some of the buying was due to that class
I of Investors who come into the market to buy ;
stocks at a low range of prices for the actual
return In yearly income. " '
London was a buyer to some extent here,
in spite of the significant weakness of Spanish
4's on the foreign exchanges. It is evident that
foreign exchanges look to New York for an
initiative for the present. Badly stated, it j
seems remarkable that there should be a sharp :
net advance in the prices of securities on the i
Stock Exchange in the week which witnessed ;
the publication of the report of the Maine j
Board of Inquiry and the apparent abandon- !
ment of diplomatic negotiations looking to the
conservation of peace with Spain. The fact
Is that prices are from 1 to 4 points higher
in all of the points that make up the bulk of
the bustr.ess on the Stock Exchange. This was
due in part to technical conditions In the mar- I
ket " "- â  ' " * '
When the bears attempted to take their
profits on Monday by buying stocks at the low
level Induced by the presentation of the Maine ;
Board of Inquiry report they found themselves,
forestalled by a powerful bull clique, who had
secured a large part of the available floating '
supply of the stocks. Not for years has there
been seen so sudden an advance In prices as
in Monday's bear panic. The bulge in prices ',
seemed to have been- designed originally by ,
some of . the large bear operators themselves
with the purpose of shaking off some of !
their undesirable following by forcing them to
cover their contracts and thus leave the way
open for a further decline. The big bears were
supposed to have been caught In their own
trap, and it was generally believed Monday
night the shorts were practically eliminated in !
the market. Later developments, especially j
on Wednesday, showed that there was a large
outstanding short interest, and the belief pre
vailed at the end of the week that this short
Interest was still large. The sensitiveness of j
the market to the faintest suggestion of a
peaceful adjustment of the Cuban question
goes to confirm the belief. The demands on '
New York from other domestic centers for â 
money showed a marked Increse and the
losses in currency in the latter part of the ;
week are probably not adequately reflected in ;
the banks' returns. Those kisses are shown j
â  to be more than offset by receipts of imported |
specie. But the calling of loans yesterday and j
the marking up of call loans to 6 per cent in
dicates that the banks are disposed to take
measures to strengthen themselves. Estimates
and opinions vary widely as to how far the
Imports of gold, which now amount to over '
H0.000.000. from Eurhpe. have been drawn
against Cuban rraln and cotton bills, and how
much of the accumulated exchange against
Europe still remains in New York as collateral
for loans. That there is still a liberal supply
of exchange to be liquidated Is generally be- :
lieved. Large Kinking nnd financial interests
! In Wall street are believed to be in substantial
1 accord regarding the course to be pursued to
j Insure the greatest safety and stability In the i
I event of the shock of war.
Bonds have moved In sympathy with stocks, |
but have net been as active. Prices are 2 to 3
. per cent higher, and In exceptional cases 5 to 1
I per cent. :;.;.:.â¢
Government bonds have weakened in the lat
: tPr part of the week, but they show net ad- i
vances over last Saturday amounting to 2% in
the new 4s coupon. 2 In the new 4s registered.

LONDON MARKET.
. NEW YORK, April 2.â The Evening Post's
London :. financial cablegram says: The stock
market here opened flat to-day, but there was
: no panic. The condition was apathetic, with a
certain amount of nervousness In ' places. â¢ The
. account Is generally really too small to war
rant anything like a panic. The chief ap
prehension Is In the money . market, on fears
1 of a further gold drain to New York In the
: event of war. The Bank of England reserve
last week was the lowest since 1593.
War risks at Lloyds are nominally quoted at
; 40. per cent, but such transactions . are merely
of a betting nature, not genuine business.-'-.
Americans were flat, but above the New
York parity : all â¢ day. Cape gold and Japanese
yen to arrive next week have been practically
engaged for New York.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 2.â Wheat opened almost at !
â  call price, July starting at sS^OSSvic, against j
yesterday's closing price of 82"d@S3c, and sell- !
tng up In a short time to 84% c. The demand j
; from both local and Southwestern shorts was j
, the most active in some time, and a good deal j
- of difficulty was experienced in covering lines j
of any importance, as offerings were scattered, j
and sharp competition resulted. The heavy
cash sales for export and domestic milling |
. purposes during the past week, which was the j
feature of yesterday's Etrength, was evidently
I still In the minds of traders. Another factor !
was the sharp advance at Liverpool, where
1 prices were about Id above yesterday's. This
strength, reports of further heavy sales at the
board and a continued large demand from the
; Continent lent strength to the theory which i
i haa gradually been growing that the actual i
outbreak of hostilities would mean an lmme- !
dlate advance In prices, and it was generally j
: believed that Liverpool was acting on this |
. theory. The trade was much influenced by the j
large business done in low-grade wheat jester- !
day, one linn disposing ot about SOO.OuO bushels.
1 To-day's engagements were reported equally
â¢ heavy. A slight decline followed the advance
i to (>4 < iÂ»c, holders letting go a little more freely, j
Hull offerings were snapped up so quickly |
that after sagging to 84 -gc the market began \
: to climb again, and did not stop until Soc |
I had been bid and accepted. There the mar- !
i ket held fur some lime, and a large business i
was done at that figure. Realizing resulted in !
a gradual decline in the price, July getting
down to S4V 4 c, where it closed. Before the
crowd left the pit, however, M^c was bid.
1 Corn was tirm and a good business was done.
Shorts were large buyers all the day, commis
sion houses doing most of the selling. May
closed a n l JJ l^c higher.
Oats were more active than usual. Shorts
were the best buyers. May closed HÂ®Wc
higher. ,
Early trading In provisions was marked by 1
sharp advances, but realizing caused a general
: decline from the top. At the close May pork |
was 12Vic higher, May lard 12 l sc higher and 1
May ribs 100 higher.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. April 2.â The Financier says:
The statement of the Associated Banks of New
York city for the week ending April 1 shows
an Increase of $1,8C9.325 In excess reserve, but
it is evident that the gold imported to date
docs not show in the totals. Since the present
movement began there haa been received In
New York over $29,000,000 in specie, but the
specie increases, as reported by the banks since
the first receipts, arc less than $22,000,000. This,
it should be stated, is inclusive of domestic
receipts. The operations of the week were net
widely different from what had been antici
pated. Loans show a further shrinkage of
$1,317,200, due to general liquidation in Stock
Exchange circles and the sale of sterling ex
change collateral, while deposits decreased
$3,413,700. The shrinkage in deposits probably
represents, in part, withdrawals by interior
banks, since the movement of currency Is once
more against this center, but the loss of $4,250,
700 in legal tenders appears to be in excess of
the known shipments to country banks.
The decrease of $3,413,700 in deposits lowered
the reserve requirements $5n3,425, and this,
added to the gain of $1,015,900 in cash, makes
th.? expansion in excess reserve as reported
above. The banks are on a very solid footing
Their business has been narrowed to close lim
its and the cash reserves have increased In
proportion. Counting the gold now in ship
ment and the larger amounts which can be
obtained without trouble they are prepared to
meet emergencies. Future money quotations
depend on this week's developments in Con
gress, but it is assurinc to know that the
chances of a squeeze In rates have been mini
mized to a large extent by the appropriations
already made. Any rapid advances are bound
to bring additional and heavier gold imports
ns the interior banks have taken at least
$20,000,000 from New York institutions. It is >
interesting to note that the lawful reserve of
the national banks, according to the state
ments to the Comptroller on February IS, were I
$10,000,000 heavier than on December 15, and
that the percentage of reserve of the country
banks was no less than 31. 2S per cent. The
average cash reserve of the entire national
system . was 33.23 . per ' cent, but this has in
creased in the last six weeks. 'The banks. In
brief, are unusually well supplied with money.

SWALLOWING HIS WORDS.
"While I was at Moscow," writes a
traveler, whose words are reproduced
by the Detroit Free Press, "a volume
was published In favor of the liberty of
the people. In this book the iniquitous
conduct of the public functionaries, and
even of the sovereign, were censured
severely. The book created great indig
nation, and the offender was at once
taken into custody. After being tried
in a summary way he was condemned
to eat his own words. A scaffold was
erected in a public square, the imperial
provost, the magistrates and the phy
sicians of the Czar attending, the book
was separated from the binding, and
the margin cut off. The author was
then served, leaf by leaf, by the pro
vost, and was obliged to swallow this
unpalatable stuff on pain of the knout,
more feared in Russia than death. As
soon as the medical gentlemen were of
the opinion that he had eaten as much
as he could with safety, the transgres
sor was returned to prison. This pun
ishment was renewed the following day,
until, after several hearty meals, every
leaf of the book was actually swal
lowed."

GIRLS LEAD IN
STORY WRITING.
April 12 will be the last day to mail
stories to be placed upon the boys' and
girls' competitive pages. The girls are
making a much bettt-r showing than the
boys up to date. The bo-ys must move
with more energy <ir the girls will be
liable to be easy winners. Washington
and Oregon and many towns and cities
In California are represented by the ju
venile writers who have entered upon
the competition. This indicates that
th<?re is widespread interest in the
orignal query, "Is there any superior-,
lty of sex in literature?"
]t has been decided to increase the
number of judges. There will be fif
teen judges, eight women and seven
men. They are all engaged in educa
tional work and are all outside of San
Francisco. Their work will not be ar
duous, but it will require good judg
ment. They will say whether tho boys"
page or the girls' page is the better.
Each judge will be requested to write
a brief judgment for publication. This
will nut be the least interesting feature
of the affair. No one will take exception
to giving the majority to the women
in making up the bench. A better aver
age view will be taken by a larger than
by a smaller number. This is the rea
son for having fifteen instead of five,
as originally intended. Fifteen commu
nities will be represented by the judges.
That will insure variety, interest and
freshness of thought.
Juliette Driscoll, 25 Porland street,
San Francisco; R. Maud Mallory of
Reedley, Cal., who was one of the suc
cessful competitors for place on the
Young Authors' Page, and Eugene P.
Conway of Los Angeles, who enjoyed
similar distinction, have forwarded
very valuable suggestions concerning
the pending test of literary ability.
Miss Mallory thinks that there should
be- essays, but that point has been
settled. The matter will consist of
stories. Miss Mallory will find no diffi
culty in peopling with imaginary be
ings the scenery which she so well de
scribes and â there is a story!
There is some discussion concerning
the apv limit still. It will be recollected
that the younger writers had as good
chance as the older ones in the pre
vious competition. Young children are
as original as older ones â perhaps more
soâ and, in the long run, originality is
reasonably certain to excite its full
snare of interest. Originality will be
of the leading tests applied in se
lecting the stories for the competitive
pages. Only about one fortnight re
f a- the boys and girls to mail
their storieji, Da not forget that the
final date is April 12. To have place
on the pages will be an honor.
LITTLE NELLIE'S VISIT.
BY JUDITH GUSLEAN.
"< >h, dear! I always have to work
and have nobody to play with. I do
wish I lived in the city."
The speaker was Nellie Weaver. She
lived in a little village. Mrs. Weaver
wanted to raise Nellie to be a helpful
child, and she made Nellie wipe the
dishps ar.d dust the chairs.
When Mrs. Weaver found Nellie cry
ing she asked: "What is my Nellie cry
ing for?" Nellie told her and then her
mother said: "Nellie, if you lived in the
city you would not think so. There
are so many people there that if you
were not careful you would be lost."
Nellie said: "Oh, yes, I would like it."
It was a bright May morning" when
Mrs. and Mr. Weaver and Nellie took
the cars to go to San Francisco. They
arrived at their destination at 11
o'clock.
N*-.]]ie. thought it was grand. So
many stores and pretty dresses!
In the afternoon they took a walk.
Mr?. Weaver said: "Nellie, walk in
of "US." Nellie said: "Yep."
She walked along very happy. In a
few minutes ehe turned around and she
(lid not see her mother. She started to
cry. Her mother was looking for Nellie
and soon beheld Nellie crying. Mrs.
Weaver picked her up and carried her
into a car. Nellie soon dried her tears
and enjoyed her ride.
When they reached the hotel Nellie
was nearly run over by a horse in get
ting out of the car.
She was glad -when the week was up
and her parents and herself started to
go back to their little village home.
After that Nellie always did what her
mother thought best.
THE BUMPKINS ASTONISH THEMSELVES AND THE GRANGER BY THEIR WILD CIRCUS HURDLE RIDING.
THREE BEARS VISIT GOLDIE.
AFTER Goldilocks, fleeing from the
Big Bear, the Middle-Sized Bear
and the Tiny Bear, had reached
her home in safety she bolted the
door of her bedroom and looked
out of a window into the near-by for
est. She saw the Three Bears looking
at her earnestly. She ran from the
window, hnrried into her bed and
pulled the bed clothes over her nose
ON THEIR WAY TO VISIT GOLDIE.
and lay there, trembling, hearing the
Bears growling outside.
Presently there came a loud knock
ing upon her chamber door.
Goldilocks made no noise, but went
farther under the bed clothes and
stopped breathing to listen. "Oh! oh!"
she thought, "the Big Bear and the
Middle-Sized Bear and the Tiny Bear
have broken into the house and they
will drag me out from here, and â and â
what shall I do?"
The knocking continued. Goldilocks
stood it as long as* her fear would per
mit. Then she Jumped out of bed,
thinking that there might be a chance
for her to escape by the window. Lo!
The Three Bears were all in front of
the house. Goldilocks breathed easily
again. But who was that knocking at
the door?
"Is that you Tom?" she asked.
"Yes, let me in." Tom was Goldi
locks' "big" brother. She was glad to
hear his voice and she hastened to open
the door.
"Well," said Tom, "you and I are in
a nice pickle. Pa and ma have gone
to town and will not be home for a
week. You and I are here to keep
house and here are the Three Bears,
who will not even let me go out to get
wood to build a fire. There is not much
in the house to eat. Now, what shall
we do?"
Tom was twelve years old. Goldi
locks was younger â hardly ten. These
two children had to plan how to outwit
the Three Bears. They went to the
kitchen to- talk it over. There were
three windows in that room, a big one,
a little one and a middle-sized one.
While the children talked three shad
ows fell into the room. The Three
Bears had smelled them and were now
looking in, the Big Bear at the big
window, the Tiny Bear at the small
window and the Middle Sized Bear at
THE SAN ER AN CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898*
the middle sized window.
Gurrough! Gurrough! Gurrc-ugh!
The Three Bears llattened their noses
against the window panes and growled
in chorus. Goldilocks was dreadfully
scared, but Tom said: "We'd better
let them into the house, or they will
break out the windows."
"Yes," agreed Goldilocks, trembling
violently, "perhaps, if we let them in,
they will not be so cross."
Tom unbolted the door and said, in
a loud voice: "Will the Big Hear, the
Middle Sized Bear and the Tiny Bear
please come in and have some supper?"
The Three Bears did not wait for a
second invitation. In they walked. The
Great Big Bear took the easy chair;
the Middle-sized Bear sat in a rocker
and the Tiny Bear took Goldilocks'
little chair. There were three sharp
GOLDIE PLAYS AND THE BEARS SING.
cracks, and all the three chairs broke
down at once; and the Three Bears fell
on the floor. j*>
"Fine trick!" growÃd the Big Bear;
"and I think we'd better eat these
children up at once, for I am growing
very hungry."
"Good idea!" said the Middle-sized
Bear.
Just then a queer noise came from
the parlor, where the Tiny Bear had
found the piano and was playing upon
it, seated on a revolving stool. There
were some tinkling sounds, then a great
crash upon the keys, and then a heavy
fall. The Tiny Bear had not understood
that the top of the piano-stool turned,
so it fell off. In a second it was angry,
but its accident served to call the other
bears into the parlor, and before they
thought more about eating the children
Tom had run to the poultry-yard and
was back again.
"Quick, Goldilocks," said he; "put on
your apron â  and cook supper for the
Bears!"
In a trice a fire was fcrackling in the
stove. Goldilocks had on her white
apron, acting as cook, and she looked
so sweet that the Three Bears fell in
love with her. Truth to say, they were
more in love with the sweet smells that
came from the stove. Such white bis
cuit! Such yellow cookies as she made!
I believe that the fairies helped Gold
ilocks, for she had supper cooked and
ready to serve by the time the Three
Bears had lost their curiosity and had
begun to growl again.
She placed a white spread on the ta
ble and put so much on it to eat that
even she was astonished. She had
roasted three geese, one for each of
the Three Bears. When she opned the
oven it was full of roast gooseâ ten, fif
teen, twenty birdsâ all browned and
smoking hot; and there were three
huge platters full of hasty pudding;
pies and frosted cakes by the dozen.
The Three Bears murmured with de
light, as they tucked their napkins up
into their necks. They made funny
noises while they ate; and they were
as greedy as pigs. When they had
eaten until it should seem that they
must burst, Tom pronounced the magic
word :
"Honey!"
"Eh!" said all the Throe Bears at
once.. "What's that? Honey? Bring
it at once."
Tom went out and came in, stagger
ing under a load of honey in three pans,
a huge one for the Big Bear, a me
dium sized pan for the Middle Sized
Bear and a smaller pan for the Tiny
Bear.
What a growlâ three growls in fact â
of pleasure rose at that festal board!
THE BEARS HAVING A GREAT FEAST.
Bears like honey more than they like
little girls. As long as the honey would
huld out there was no danger for
Goldilocks to fear.
"Your health, Goldilocks!" said the
Big Bear, taking a long drink of pure
honey.
"Health," echoed the Middle-Sized
Bear.
"Great sport," said the Tiny Bear.
'"Rah for Goldilocks!"
The Three Bears ate until they could
not hold another morsel. Never in their
lives had they been so feasted. They
talked about moving and making Goldi
locks their cook. Such goose! Such
cakes and pies and cookies! And â oh,
my! â such- honey!
"What will we do next, Goldilocks?"
asked the Big Bear.
"We might have some music," Goldi
locks said, demur ly.
"Just the thin"- " all the Three Bears
responded. "Let's sing. You ought to
hear us!"
Goldilocks sat at the piano and played
while the Three Bears sang. The Big
Bear led off and the other bears came
in on the chorus, about as follows:
THE BEARS' SONG.
Three Bears once lived In a little house.
Their cupboard once was bare!
For Bears who much loved to carouse
They found this hard to bear.
Chorus.
Then Goldilocks came to the place-
She would have fed us rarelyâ
But off she skippedâ with weeping faceâ
Oh! She escaped us barely!
When the Three Bears roared the
chorus of this queer song Goldilocks
laughed so that she forgot to play the
accompaniment. Up jumped the Big
Bear and took her place at the piano.
Up Jumped the Middle Sized Bear, drew
up another chair and began to drum.
Up jumped the Tiny Bear, found a lit
tle chair and pushed it to the piano.
All Three Bears played and sang at
once. Their big hairy paws thumped
out strange sounds; their hairy throats
made stranger noises; anon their long
red tongues hung from their mouths
and they laughed uproariously.
But all things must end. They grew
tired and sleepy. Goldilocks and Tom
insisted that they should sleep in the
house. There was one huge, wide
spring bed, with snowy sheets and soft
blankets, for them to rest upon. They
slept well, but, in the morning, there
was a strange hub-bub in the little
cottage. Tom had set the bed like a
trap. One strong pull on a stout cord
that was fastened to the bed, and it
shut up at once!
Never were Three Bears snared so be
fore! Never before did Three Bears growl,
threaten, coax and cry so! Tom saw
that they were securely trapped and,
locking the doors, drove away with
Goldilocks to the house of a neighbor,
who was a- great hunter. The next
day the Three Bears were sold to a
menagerie. . Goldilocks had the house
of the Three Bears for a playhouse.

GOING AFTER BERRIES.
BY CLARE STRATTON.
Where were the children? They 'had
gone with the others to pick blackber
ries. Their mother did not want them
to g6; but they teased so that she fin
ally yielded, telling Ethel and Clyde,
the older ones, to take care of them.
But they saw some berries and ran off.
leaving the little ones to look out for
themselves.
They saw some berries, too, and ran
off to get them, and when they had
picked them they ran after some more.
Pretty soon they were a long way from
the big children. It was late in the
afternoon when they looked around and
saw that they were lost. Helen, only
three years old, began to cry. Harry,
who was older, tried to be a man, and
told Helen not to cry. They wandered
until it was dark, andithey were tired
out. Then they sat down and cried
and cried. Soon they saw a cow and
Harry milked and they drank the milk.
Then they picked some grass and put
it all in a pile and lay down on it and
went to sleep.
While they were doing this, their
mother and all the children were look
ing everywhere for them. â¢
After a time they saw Helen's sun
bonnet. They followed on until they
came to the river. There they lost
the trail and they thought the chil
dren had been drowned. But they
went over the bridge and, when they
had. crossed, they found the tracks
again. Three miles froi.i the river
they found the little ones lying fast
asleep. Their mother woke them up
and they danced and laughed.
When they got home and were eat
ing bread and milk, Helen started to
cry hard. She said she was crying be
cause she was lost.
"But you are found now," said her
mamma.
"Well, I didn't have time then; so I
am going to cry now." And she cried
herself to sleep. Her mother declared
HERE THEY ARE HAVING A BEAR NAP.
that they could never go blackberry
ing again, unless she went with them.
AN EVENING DREAM.
BY MAY BETH.
By my window I sit thinking.
While the sun sets in the west;
The herds come homeward clinking
Their bells and seeking rest.
Its silver radiance bringing
The moon illumes the air.
The church bells, softly ringing,
Call young and old to prayer.
The choir's melodious voices
Come to me, sweet and low;
My heart of hearts rejoices
In dreams of long ago.
iIOKJIbS AIBOU r LiIITLE PEFS
BY BEATRICE Dl BERNARDI.
Trtxie did not love her dolls as de
votedly as most little ladies do. Then
you think she must have been very
lonely sometimes because she had no
little brothers nor sisters to play with?
No, indeed! Her warm little heart
kept her very busy with her pets of
various kinds.
Grandma and grandpapa had a large
play house built for her. Oh! yes,- the
dolls were all .there, to be sure, but
they were disposed of in distant cor
ners!
I suppose if they had suddenly be
come animated there would have been
much comment and indignation ex
pressed in their wide open eyes be
cause their mistress had brought into
their presence birds, a pet guinea hen,
and once a guinea pig, and had caressed
and chatted with them and allowed the
two mountain quail to walk up her
arms to her head before their very
eyes!
While they, the dolls, might only be
elegantly attired in ball gowns and
walking costumes. They did not un-

"It's going to rain, 1 ' said Gladys,
And she looked both merry and wise.
" Why, how do you. know," cried Madge and Flo
With wide and wondering eyes,
"For yon can't read, and papa says
The weather clerk don't know ?"
"Mine does, I guess," laughed Gladys. "Yes,
Just wait and he'll tell you so."
And sure enough, from the garden,
Where the winds of spring blew strong,
Came a funny croak that seemed half a joke ,
The violet beds among
Then next it was under the rose trees,
And the curious children spied
A speckled and brown frog hopping. down
In the thick green leaves to hide.
While "Rain, more rain," he called for
Till Madge and Flo said, " Well,
You're a pretty clerk of the weather*, your work
Is nothing but play to tell 4
It's going to rain and spoil our fun,"
But he solemnly answered, "Rain,"
While the clouds blew low into piles of snow,
And froggy was right, it was plain.
For fast and harder came raindrops,
Till the children ran inside,
But though surely soaked that frog still croaked,
And for "Rain, more rain" he cried.
You don't believe it ? Listen
Some day near a pool or bog.
And "Rain, more rain," he will tell you plain,
This weather sharp of a frog.
derstand how Trixie loved these warm
little creatures. After all, you know,
they were only dolls!
The little girl coaxed until she had an
aviary also. A room opening off the
old lumber room of curiosities made a
splendid one. It had "pigeon-hole"
nests and bracket nests, and a nice
drop fountain for bathing purposes,
where the feathered friends could take
their daily bath. There was a large
wire case looking out on to the side
porch, where stood two long, high back
settees, where Trixie could lounge and
learn of happiness in the songs of those
singers who would come out into this
cage to sing to their dear little mis
tress.
Trixie used to go into this aviary
room, sit down and read and watch her
pets. She would pretend to try to rob
a nest builder of the bit of paper or
raveled rope he was gathering in his
bill, but he did not mind; for he knew
it was only play, you know! When a
nest contained pretty little eggs she
was delighted and all concern for their
being undisturbed; and, when those
eggs became odd looking birdlingsâ
well, be assured they were reared in
luxury, and were given favorite names,
to which they quickly responded.
They loved the gentle hand that
caressed and cared for them and en
tered into Trixie's ideas daintily and
intelligently. Why, after they had
been placed in position two or three
times they understood, and afterward
only required a signal from her to know
just when and how to repeat it.
Such specialties as running up minia
ture stairs and lying down, getting up
or turning a somersault is what she
taught them. In her own room she had
a bay window. A branch of eucalyptus
placed there furnished a place for the
Australian paroquets to slide down
and to sleep at night, hanging by one
foot, upside down. But the mocking
birds and the goldfinch, together with

the three Java sparrows, always as
cended to the window cornice and sat
in a row to sleepâ a yard of birds!
"Cheto" was saucy and passed most
of his short life in trying to coax a
quarrel with "Bochie," one of the mock
ing-birds. Well, he picked at his long
brown feet so hard one day that
"Bochie" lifted his wings high, stooped
down and picked him up in his beak
and swung him about so hard that
when he fell he was dead!
Every day when all the other feath
ered friends were taking their siesta
the two paroquets would put their
heads under their wings and sing cor
rectly the songs they had learned from
the mocking-birds.
Trixie had one unruly pet, a hand
some coated gray squirrel. He would
not yield to kindness, neither to ad
monition, and once he bit her cruelly

CAPTAIN OF
THE CASPAR
EXCORIATED
His Negligence Causes
the Death of Thir
teen Men.
Scored by Captain Ber
mingham for Appeal
ing His Case.
Vessel Wrecked Through the i
Criminal Negligence of
Her Master.
LOWER COURT LENIENT.
A Hot Roait on Mariners Who Make
Poor Excuses for Losing Their
Vessels.
Captain Bermlngham, supervising In
spector of steam vessels, yesterday
rendered an opinion In the case of the
appeal of Captain Ole Auflndsen of the
pteamer Caspar, which went down on
Saunders reef with thirteen of her offi
cers and crew, which should make that
mariner feel worse than a green hand
who has Just been ordered aloft on a
stormy night. The decision not only crit
icizes the captain for his willful negli
gence In losing the vessel, but practically
accuses him of being the murderer of the
men who lost their lives on her. Auflnd
sen's plea of "unusually strong currents"
only holds him up for stronger criticism,
as It goes to show that he, like other
mariners who have used the same argu
ment when their vessels were lost, should
have used extra precautions for that very
reason.
The steamer Caspar left this port on
the afternoon of October 22, bound for
Usal, an outside port, about 130 miles
northwest of San Francisco. At about 3
o'clock In the morning she struck on
Saunders reef and out of the crew of
fifteen the captain and one of the sailors
were the only ones left to tell the tale.
An Investigation of the case was made
by the local board of examiners, and
Captain Auflnds*n's license was suspend
ed for a term of one year. This was con
sidered at the time as letting the cap
tain down very light, but he thought
very differently, and appealed to the
supervising Inspector.
The result can hardly be considered as
satisfactory, as Captain Bermlngham not
only sustained the decision of the lower
court, but says he thinks It was extreme
ly lenient and Is surprised at what he
terms the Impertinence of Auflndsen In
appealing the case. He also suggests that
many others who lose vessels along this
coast might advantageously be dealt with
after the manner of the captain of the
Caspar.
In his decision Captain Bermlngham
says: "The appellant testifies that his
steamer passed three miles of Point Reyes
at about 6 o'clock on the afternoon of
October 22. It was raining considerably,
with a strong southeast wind, which con
tinued until the vessel struck. I'sal is an
open port about sixty miles north of
Saunders reef, on which Is located a
whistling buoy. The appellant testifies
that he aimed to pass within two miles
of the reef to get the sound of the
whistle. After that It would be neces
sary to avoid Point Arena, To do so he
would have had to head to the windward
a little, and again two points to the north
ward to reach his port or destination,
which was an open roadstead where navi
gation would be very unsafe during the
prevalence of the wind and seÂ«. at that
time.
"Therefore, it is apparent to me
that the appellant displayed criminal
negligence in navigating his vessel
as he did without getting a cast of
the lead. As a consequence, he not
only lost her, hut caused the loss of
the lives of thirteen of his officers
and erew â all, in fact, but himself
and one seaman, Chris Larsen.
"Auflndsen In his appeal states that the
Inspectors did not pay sufficient atten
tion to the reports of Captain Bennett,
steamer T'matilla; Captain Cousins, steam
er Pomona; and Captain Dunham, steamer
Chilkat.' The said masters herein men
tioned have filed a report of a strong in
ehore set, mucn more than usual.
"But as all those vessels passed through
those waters simultaneously with the
Caspar, It is in evidence that neither of
them took the bottom at any point on the
coast. It is In evidence, however, that
Captain Dunham got his soundings In
thirty-three fathoms off Saunders reef
and hauled his ship out to westward one
eighth of a point.
"If it was necessary for the appellant to
get the sound of the whistle, why did he
not approach the reef carefully and not
go ashore full speed without getting a
cast of the lead? In almost every In
stance where a steam vessel is wrecked
on the roast of California or Oregon the
master immediately sets up a plea of un
usual Inshore currents. Is it not time that
some allowance be m.-ide for such cur
rents If they sometimes exist?
"In the case of the appellant there seems
to be no extenuating circumstances that
would Justify me In setting aside the ver
dict of me lower court, which seems to
have been lenient with the appellant,
therefore Its decision must stand, and It
Is so ordered."
ARRESTED FOB CONTEMPT.
Fifteen More Members of the Kla-
math Lumber Company Added

Deputy United States Marshal Moffltt
went to Klamathon,, Sisklyou County,
yesterday with a citation issued by
United States Circuit Judge Morrow for

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1898.
NEWS OF THE MINES.
A Glance at the Rising
Development of Our
Copper Mines.
A New Chemical Process in
Montanaâ Notes of Prog
ress Through the
State.
California will be fully represented at
the International Gold Miners' conven
tion of this summer at Salt Lake City.
When this broader getting together of
the miners was started last year, the
leaders of the California Miners' Associa
tion were doubtful about It, fearing that
the silver question would be dragged in
among other things, but their fears were
unwarranted, and the convention pro
ceeded on broad lines, doing much good.
This year's convention promises to be a
greater success, and according to the
decision of the executive committee of
the California Miners' Association, held
last week, efforts will be made to send
a large delegation from all parts of the
State. At this meeting it was decided
that the efforts of the committee on a
department of mines should be directed
to getting a commissioner of mines and
a separate bureau In the Interlr . Depart
ment, rather than the larger and better
measure, which seems a present Impossi
bility.
The annual report of the Mountain
Copper Company, which has within two
years developed a vast enterprise in its
copper mines on Iron Mountain and its
smelter at Keswick. Shasta County, is
interesting as measuring the scale of
the leading copper mining operations in
this State, and as an Indication of what
can and will be done with the copper
resources of California.
During the year the company invested
$195,220 in enlarging the smelter at Kes
wick and in other ways the scale of
operations has been enlarged. The quan
tity of ore mined and smelted was 165.060
tons, an average of about 550 tons a day.
This ore yielded 14,129 tons of copper.
From these general figures in the report
the Redding Free Press, figuring the
value of copper at 10 cents a pound, esti
mates the gross value of the copper at
$2,525,800. This one contains gold and
other values and the quartz ore pur
chased In large quantities for flux yields
a good deal of gold. The silver in the
ore is estimated to average $4 30 a ton.
and the gross output of copper, gold and
silver Is placed by this Journal at about
$4,500,000, which is probably not far out
of the way.
The pay roll amounts to about $60,000 a
month, and thus $720,000 a year is dis
tributed there in wages alone. Whether
the estimate of $2,425,000 net profit Is justi
fied or not, the showing Is one of enor
mous and quick success with a Califor
nia copper mine. This property lay unde
veloped for many years, until Hugh Mc-
Donald got a syndicate of British capi
talists interested in it and there are
awaiting enterprise and capital other cop
per properties with ore bodies as great
and with equal conditions for economical
development.
The copper belt, thirty miles long,
which sweeps north of Redding, contains
a number of undeveloped properties
which will be enormously productive
some day. â¢ There is every prospect that
the big copper mine at Copperopolls will
be reopened soon. A promising deposit
Is being developed In Fresno County, and
attention being given to other copper
claims in San Bernardino County and
other parts of the State promise that the
copper output of California will be im
mensely increased within the next few
years.
Here is another repetition of the daily
tale attending California mining and the
faith and enterprise of men who go be
low the surface to find out what there
may be there. The Grass Valley Union
says:
"The well-known Gold Flat mine, which
of late has been called the Unity, is un
der new management now. The ten
miners who have been operating it for a
year past yesterday relinquished their
bond on the mine, and it reverted to the
owners, Messrs. Weissbein Brothers of
Grass Valley. It is understood that the
miners were well paid for giving up the
property, which has been developed and
put on a paying basis by them. At the
time when they took hold o*. it there was
nothing in sight, but by practical and
economical work the pay shoot was dis
co ered and some excellent ore has been
extracted. The shaft is down to a depth
of about 3ou feet. The new operators have
already put a crew of men to work, and
will develop the mine thoroughly, and in
time it will doubtless prove a dividend
payer."
Anything in the line of cheaper pro
cesses or those adapted to ores which
have defied the processes heretofore in
use is watched with great interest by
mining men. In Montana Alderson, who
has long experimented with the cyanide
process in that field, has been developing
an original treatment for certain refrac
tory ores, and the status and promise of
his work is thus described by the West
ern Mining World:
"He Is at present experimenting with
the tailings of the Southern Cross mine.
This mine has long remained idle on ac
count of the intensely refractory charac
ter of its ores. Thousands upon tnousands
of dollars have been expended in the
past in an effort to devise some method
of treatment by which the values could
be successfully a*id economically extract
ed. Experts from various parts of the
world have pondered over the problem
and been compelled to give It up. The
mine, with its wealth of ore bodies, was
closed down, it being impossible to realize
enough values from the ores to pay the
expenses of working the property. Mr.
Alderson recently grappled with the diffi
culty, and has at last succceeded in over
coming it by chemical processes known
only to himsplf. Hp has discovered that
In the original treatment of the ore less
than 25 per cent of the values were
saved. From ninety-seven tons of tailings
so far treated he has obtained over $800.
Mr. Aldorson's successes mean a great
deal to the future of the State. It will
be only a question of time when his leach-
Ing plants will he adapted to the treat
ment of refractory ores all over the coun
try, and almost revolutionize mining in
that thousands of abandoned properties
will quickly respond to the new order of
things and take their place among the
rich producers of the northwest."
Two Australian mining men â Messrs.
Lee and Ellintâ arc in El Dorado County
looking for properties to develop.
A Redding assayer received a specimen
of eruptive rock a short aime agp, with a
request that it be tested for "nicotine," as
the finder believed it to be "nickel ore."
Ely Hutchlnson, representing an East
ern syndicate, has taken up a bond upon
the California quartz mine, twenty miles
northwest of Nevada City, and paid W.
C. Tozer and Charles D. Lane a purchase
price of $50,000.
Considerable activity is reported from
the Muletown district, and property is
changing hands every day Jn that locality.
P. W. Pyne recently sold his interest in
the Ooklen Jubileec group to Colonel
Moore and S. P. Johns. The purchasers,
with L. M. Ludivici. who owns the re
maining half interest, will continue de
velopment on what they believe is a very
promising property.â Redding Searchlight.
The dry winter threatens to severely af
fect the great hydraulic mines about
Junction City, on the Trinity River, aa
well as smaller placer mines generally.
Some of the important mines at this point
are working about half the force em
ployed at this time last year, and the
output for the season to date has been
correspondingly reduced.
Development work is being pushed to
quite an extent on Harrison Gulch and
Hall City properties, says the Search
light. Boswell & Johnson have been en
gaged in opening up a claim near Hall
City that is reported to be especially
promising. Work on this claim has been
prosecuted for over a year, and the
showing at present is all that can be de
sired. A good body of rich free gold ore
has awarded the efforts of the owners,
who have a right to feel confident of the
outcome of their venture. J. R. Hall
will start his mill by the first of the
month on ore from the Lucky Hall. The
Midas Mining Company is employing over
sixty men in its mine and mill, and is
producing good values right along. The
cyanide plant is successfully treating the
ore in an economical manner and the
permanency of the mine is an established
fact.
Another strike has been made in the
Valpariaso mine, Amador County, fifty
three feet below the tunnel level.
According to the Amador Ledger, clean
ing the south shaft at the Gwin mine is
progressing rapidly. The old shaft is
opened about 900 feet from the collar.
The work of mining through the new
shaft goes on steadily and the 40-stamp
mill is grinding 150 tons of ore per day.
Drifting and cross-cutting at the 1200
level of the South Spring shaft is pro
gressing. Ore is being encountered which
is good, but so far has not come in quan
tities sufficient to justify the starting of
the mill.
The Colfax Sentinel says the six months
just closing have been disastrous for
hydraulic and shallow gravel mining
operations, owing to the scarcity of
water. The rainfall at Colfax to date has
been 25.09 inches, as against 50.44 inches
to corresponding date of last season. At
Robinson's Flat, near Forest Hill, the
snow is at present only 1% feet In depth.
Last season at this date there were
nearly sixteen feet, well settled and
frozen.
The Kaffa gravel mine in Butte County
is to be worked on a larger scale by an
English company.
The Denver mine in Butte County is to
have a chlorination works.
The Calaveras Citizen says it is stated
that C. D. Lane will develop the Illinois
mine at once. A shaft 135 feet is in good
order, and sufficient ore is in sight to
warrant the erection of a mill.
M. Burton, who has been successfully
mining quartz crystals in Calaveras
County, has bought the Boucher &
Bracket gravel mine in that county for
$7000.
Operations are to be commenced in the
magnesite mines near St. Helena. Orders
for ore shipments have been placed with
the owners of the property.
The rich claim discovered several weeks
ago by John T. Newcomer, near the Star
mine, Tuolumne County, is showing up
splendidly. A shaft is being driven down,
and at twenty-live feet shows a strong
ledge of rock that will mill over $100 per
ton, while a like amount of the concen
trates is worth from $Ido up to $1000. The
percentage of sulpnurets Is heavy. â
Union-Democrat.
Developments at the Central Eureka
mine are progressing at a lively gait. The
shaft is being sunk from the 900 level at
the rate of five feet in twenty-four hours.
A drift was started to the north on the
900 level last week. The uprise is being
continued from the 600 to the 500 level.
On the 600 level they are drifting on a fine
body of ore. â .imador Ledger.
At the Central Eureka in Amador
County the shaft has reached 1000 feet.
At the 600 level drifting is progressing in
a large ledge of low grade ore. A drift
has also been started in the 900 level. It
is likely that a 40-stamp mill will be
erected in the fall.
The output of the Argonaut in February
was between $56.000- and $57,000 in free gold
and $I>OQJ) in sulphurets. The expenses are
estimated at $15,000 a month.
The Jamestown Magnet says the Sierra
Railroad Company has men at work near
Cooperstown prospecting for coal. At a
depth of fifty-four feet they struck a
seam of indifferent quality three and a
half feet thick. The company intends
| setting up machinery at Cooperstown,
where they will bore to the depth of sev
eral hundred feet.
It is stated that G. Simmons, discoverer
of the turquoise mine on Timber Moun
tain, Nev., has disposed of $07,000 worth
of gems to New York jewelers, and that
he has two cutters on the ground freeing
the gems from extraneous matter.
W. Beddlg, representing the Krupp
Bros, at Essen, Germany, is in Salt Lake
City. He is visiting the State in search
of uranium. This is one of the "rare
earths," and of economic value for
hardening gun metal and armor plate. It
is quoted at 60c per gram, $2 50 per pound.
It was recently reported discovered in
commercial quantities at Black Hawk,
Colo.
Active work is being pushed on the
Iron Chief mine, in the Virginia Dale dis
trict, which was recently sold for $150,000.
The owners have four eight-horse teams
from this city, besides two of their own,
at work hauling lumber and pipe from
Walters station on the Southern Pacific,
for the purpose of building a cyanide
plant, and running the pipe line thirteen
miles for the water. The owners claim
they have $500,000 of ore in sight. They
are down between 200 and 300 feet and
have crosscut the vein for 35 feet without
finding the walls, all in clear solid ore
that runs from $25 upward.
The dredge experimenters are going for
the bars of the Missouri River.
Up to this time California has furnished
the entire output of quicksilver in the
United States, no cinnabar deposits else
where having commercially developed.
Now Oregon may go on the record, ac
cording to the Oregon Mining Journal,
which says:
â¢Quicksilver is soon to be produced in
large quantities from the Black Butte
mines in Lane County, about seventeen
miles southeast of Cottage Grove. There
is a mountain of ore of all degrees of
richness, up to 56 per cent mercury. A
contract has been let for the construction
of a thirty-ton quicksilver furnace, with
condenser, fryer, etc., and every prepara
tion is being made for working the prop
erty the coming season. The report of
experts who examined the Black Butte
mine says: 'All the indications from
present developments warrant the con
clusion that the entire mountain is an
Immense deposit of quicksilver ore, which
will produce practically 2 to 3 per cent,
which, with the ease and cheapness with
which it could be worked, makes it one
of the most valuable mining propositions
in the world.' "
A SMART CABIN BOY.
M. Akada of the Steamer Belgic Ar
rested on the Charge of
Extortion. i
M. Akada, a cabin boy on the steamer
Belgic. has been doing a land office busi- '
ness with his countrymen who happened
to be passengers on the steamer. He Is : '
now in consequence locked up in the City ;
Prison on a charge of extortion.
Kusutaro Baba and four friends were
passengers on the steamer arriving here
in January last. On the voyage they got ',
talking to Akada. who informed them ;
that they could not land on American
soil under the exclusion act, but on the ,
payment of $15 each he could fix it. They
gave him the money before the arrival
of the steamer, and did not know that ;
anything was wrong till they began to
talk with their countrymen here. Then
they discovered that they had been vie- I
timized.
When the steamer arrived on her pres
ent trip they ca*.ed upon Akada and de
manded back their money, but he re
fused, and yesterday Baba appeared in
Judge Joaehimsen's court and swore to a
complaint for the arrest of Akada on a
charge of extortion. His four friends
were with him. and each was anxious to
swear out a warrant also, but it was
thought that one would be enough.
Akada was arrested yesterday after
noon. Just before the steamer started on
her voyage to cmna.
To Visit President McKinley.
George E. Morse, Clerk of the United

ing such district, a majority of the
owners of the land within said district

ARTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
j mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
I years thereafter until the object cx
i pressed in this provision shall have
I been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as the
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, In order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the Incurring of municipal Indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and,
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most. Important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the salo
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, aa
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. Tha
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors %
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election al
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votea
cast thereon shall be adopted- but in
caae the votes cast in favor of both
shall or-39
propositions shall not exceed one-half I (
. the total number of votes' cast thereon, ]
both propositions shall be deemed re
" jected.
â  - Nothing in this section shall be so
â construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid i
petition of the electors requesting the j
1 .acquisition of any public utility by pro- j ;
i ceeding at once, without the submission â 
â  â .â of propositions to the electors as afore- (
â  '..said, to pass an ordinance declaring its j
: determination to acquire the same &s i
''â  'provided in section six of this Article ,
.; : and. from proceeding thereafter to ac- j
1 .quire the same in the manner herein- I
/ after provided. . ]
.. ! Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public ' ,
'.utility sought to be acquired under the ! (
â¢ provisions of this Article, can be paid
. out of the annual revenues of the City j j
â¢and County, in addition to the other I
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall | ;
; be lawful to acquire the same by a ma- â¢
â¢ jority vote of the electors voting there- ;
on at any special election. In submit
:â  ting propositions to the electors for i
"" such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of j '
. .the public utility, the proposed method ;
' and manner of payment therefor, and P
submit to the electors the question
:.= ."whether the same shall be acquired
â¢upon such terms.
: 'â¢" .In case, however, the cost of such ;
;. public utility sought to be acquired '
,] under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues !
â¢'â¢'of the City and County, in addition to
[ .the other necessary expenditures there- .
:.\\of, as to render it necessary to incur a I
.^municipal Bonded indebtedness for such
'/.purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub- ;
nutting propositions to the electors for :
; .-'the acquisition thereof, shall specify (
.therein the amount of the proposed
â  .bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter
â  est thereon, and whether such bonded
: Indebtedness shall be incurred. At
â¢.least two-thirds of the electors voting
: thereon at such election shall be neces
;â¢ sary to secure such acquisition and to \ '
warrant the issuance of municipal j
' bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth. ,
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
: .shall have determined, as hereinbefore j :
. . Set forth, to acquire any public utility, j ',
â¢ such action on the part of the electors j
â â¢ shall be equivalent to the passing of I
â  the ordinance by the Supervisors de- j
claring such determination as set forth :
In section six of this Article, and the
/Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a ,
special election as required by section ! ,
'. seven of this Article. i
.' . Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de- j
- t'<?rmine that the public interest or ne- j i
' eessity demands the acquisition, con- | ;
â¢ struction or completion of any public â¢
â  utility, the cost of which will be too ! .
â great to be paid out of the ordinary an
. nual income and revenue of the City and j ;
County, the Supervisors shall, by or- j â 
(finance, specifically declare such de- | i
.termination, and shall publish the same . i
:â¢ for at least two weeks in the official j i

pointed, and shall include, when ap
propriate, tests of physical qualifica
tions, health, and of manual or pro
fessional skill.
Sec. 5. The selection of laborers I

animations, and may, whenever an ex
amination is to take place, designate a|
suitable number of persons, either in or !
not in the official service of the City
and County, to be examiners; and, if !

of their official duty, without extra
compensation, to conduct such ex
aminations as the Commissioners may

expiration of the neriod of probation,
the head of the department or office in
which a candidate is employed, may,
