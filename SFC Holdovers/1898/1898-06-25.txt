OPERATIONS OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY AND NAVAL FORCES.
Fifteen mile* to the east of Santiago, nt the month of the Rio Buiqulri, is the Iron pier at w liich the
transports landed their iirst troops on \\>dnenday.
Some eincht miles further east is the I'laya del Este, where the Americans have made a. shore con
nection with the cahle line running; from Santiago to Gnnntanamo, and thus secured quick, communication
with the I nited States, via Mole St. Nicholas and Cape Haytien.
The strategic naval movements accompanying: the landing; of. General Shatter's troops at Balquirl
were extended along: the twenty niiles of const line from Ilaconao to Cnbnniin, while the Cubans to the
west and north of Santiago attacked the outlying: Spanish pontn at the ovine time.
-\ t ( a iimui*. to the -Â»vest of the Morro liattery, the battleship Texas at daybreak cleared the enemy
from the shore batteries, while tienernl lUlii attacked the town of Mnzamorra just to the north.
The liitttleMhip lowa about the same time shelled and silenced the wnter batteries under the Morro,
while the Helena, Newport and Bancroft, with the yacht Vixen, drove the enemy from the fort at the mouth
of the Jurutc nn River, ten miles further east.
All the way dnwn the cnamt as far as Daromo the various other venae!:* of the hlockadl ng fleet and
the convoy squadron shelled the hills nnd the woods. dislodging the Spanish troop*, nho, in strong force,
were covering every available laiwliiu; place for a distance of eight leugue* on either aide of Santiago
harbor.
At !Â»:4Â«Â» n. m. the New Orleans, â with the Detroit. Wasp, Machias and Suwanee, opened on the bat
tery covering the Baiqairi landing, and soon cleared the Spaniards out. A large part of the troops were
soon on shore nnd a strong force was at once thrown out on the road to Santiago. Just out from Daiquiri
on that road nun the scene of the first battle of the Americans on Cuban soil.
Herrneo and Sihoney. which were also objects of attack by the fleet, nnd where a part of the
Amertcnu troop" landed, are just east of Baiqniri. The army is camped on the rolling ground between
these places.
Every ronil lending out of Santiago, including those from Tlnyaino, Holgnin, Mayari and Gnantn
iiniiid, by which reinforcements might come, is covered by Rabi's and Garcia's men. Communication over
fairly jrc.oil roads has been established between the American camp and the main body of General Garcia's
army, operating along the Grand Calmano, or highway from Guantannmo to Santiago, to the HOiith of
Julia in the mountains, near which, the permanent headquarters of Gurciu's army li.-in been located for the
past twelve or eighteen monthtt.
them were killed.
Edward Marshall, a New York
correspondent, was at the front
with the Rough Riders and was
seriously wounded. A number
of newspaper men have gone with
food and water and a surgeon to
bring Marshall to the coast. The
enemy had received reinforce
ments from Santiago, who
brought with them ten field
pieces. They are fortifying the
hill at Sevilla, which commands
the road to Santiago.
The Rough Riders have re
ceived high praise from General
Shafter for the gallant style in
which they defeated the Span
iards. The enemy were utterly
routed.
General Castillo, with 2000 Cu
bans, reports having defeated the
Spaniards of Guasima with heavy
loss. The Cuban losses were less
than fifty. The insurgents cap
tured two railroad trains laden
with food supplies and 100 tons
of coal. Further re-enforcements
of Cubans are expected shortly.
Transports are now en route to
Cerra to get General Garcia and
his forces, who will be brought
here as quickly as possible.
Large quantities of supplies
and a number of horses were
landed at Siboney this morning.
The landing was covered by the
Montgomery, Suwanee, Scorpion
and Wampatuck. They shelled
the woods hotly, driving out the
enemy.
The troops sent out in advance
were commanded by General
Young. The Rough Riders were
on his flank, several miles further
inland. They were guarding him
from surprise. Of the cavalry
there were in the expedition sev
eral troops of the First and Tenth
and eight battalions of Rough
Riders, all dismounted. There
were not 1200 men in all. They
found 2000 Spaniard in the
thicket and finally drove them
back to the defenses of the town.
Fourteen dead Spaniards were
found, but this does not measure
the Spanish loss. The last resist
ance of the Spanish was at a
blockhouse, which was stormed
and carried. Four regiments of
infantry, including the Seventy
first New York and some of the
Ninth Cavalry, were hurried for
ward as a re-enforcement.
NEW YORK, June24âHam

ALGER GETS THE NEWS
FROM PRESS DISPATCHES
Begrets the American Losses, But
Gratified Over the
Victory.
WASHINGTON, June 25.â Up to 2
o'clock this morning neither the Presi
dent nor Secretary Alger had received
news concerning the land engagement
near Santiago which occurred yester
day morning. When the first bulletin
relative to the engagement was shown
to Secretary Alger at 1 o'clock he ex
pressed the deepest concern and re
quested that he be given further par
ticulars as soon as received. Shortly
before 2 o'clock the story of tht? en
gagement was read to the Secretary
through a telephone. As the names of
the killed and wounded were read the
Secretary counted the numbers aloud,
apparently making note of them as
they reached him.
While the Secretary expressed the
deepest regret for the loss of the offi
cers and men, he was greatly
to learn that the American forces had
achieved what appears to have been a
decisive victory. So great was the in
terest Alger manifested in the battle
that he reauested. notwithstanding the
lateness of the hour, that he be given
any further -irticulars which might
be received. No Information concern
ing the officers and the men killed in
the engagement could be obtained at
the War Department, as no official
having charge of the muster rolls was
on duty.
Captain Allyn K. Capron of Troop L.
Roosevelt's Rough Riders, who is
among the killed, was a son of Captain
Allyn Capron of the First Artillery and
was well known in Washington. He
was a second lieutenant of the Seventh
Cavalry and was recently promoted to
be a captain in the volunteer service
and was given command of Troop L
of the Rough Riders. He was a young
and dashing officer and was regarded
by his superiors as one of the most
promising cavalry officers in the ser
vice.
GERMANY INTENDS TO
REMAIN NEUTRAL
State Department Assured There Will
Be No Interference at
Manila.
WASHINGTON, June 24.â The Asso
ciated Press is able to state on au
thority that permission to land marines
or troops at Manila has not been
sought by the German Embassador
here of the State Department, nor has
any such permission been granted. In
fact, there have been no overtures ex
changed on the subject.
The only important development at
to-day's Cabinet meeting was the posi
tive settlement of the question of the
attitude of Germany with respect to
the Philippines. The Secretary of State
has received assurances which settle
beyond question all doubts on this
point. Germany has no intention, pres
ent or prospective, of interfering in any
way with the ~olicy or plans of the
United States in regard to the occupa
tion of the islands.
Its attitude has been and will con
tinue to be one of strict neutrality.
This statement, coming from high of
ficial sources, is accepted by this Gov
ernment in perfect good faith and is
regarded as final and conclusive. No
attention will be paid by this Govern
ment to any reports to the contrary
which are constantly being sent out. as,
it is believed, in the interest of Spain.
Official reports received from Admiral
Dewey at Manila state that there never
has been an intimation that Germany
or any other nation by its naval repre
sentatives has ever shown the least dis
position to overstep the line of strict
neutrality, nor has there been any rea
son to believe that th,Â° Germans' sym
pathies were strongly with the Spanish
in the present struggle.
HOBSON RECEIVES
OFFICIAL PRAISE
He Is Now Quartered in the City,
About Four Miles From
Morro.
NEW YORK, June 24.â A dispatch to
the Herald from Washington says:
Secretary Long has sent to Assistant
Naval Constructor R. P. Hobson, in
care of the commander-in-chief of the
North Atlantic squadron, an inspiring
letter commending him for the extra
ordinary heroism he displayed in sink-
Ing the collier Merrimac in the harbor
of Santiago de Cuba.
In the letter he says: "The depart
ment takes this occasion to most hear
tily congratulate you upon your most
distinguished conduct, and avails itself
of this opportunity to inform you that
It has taken steps to give you some
professional reward, as recommended
by the commander-in-chlef, which the
department hopes will be gratifying to
you, and at the same time assures you i
that your gallant act not only reflects j
additional luster upon the traditional |
glories of the navy, but that you are i
held in grateful remembrance by your
fellow countrymen and appreciated by
thf whole civilized world."
This letter was personally signed by
Secretary Long. It will be held by Ad
miral Sampson until an opportunity is
found to convey it to the young officer,
now a prisoner in Santiago de Cuba.
WASHINGTON, June 24.â The Navy
Department has just received the fol
lowing cablegram:
"Playa del Este, June 24.â From a
flag of truce I learned to-day that Lieu
tenant Hobson and his companions are
all well. They are confined in the city
of Santiago, four miles from Morro.
"SAMPSON."
GENERAL MILES WILL
COMMAND IN CUBA
Eighteen Thousand Troops to Be Sent
to Reinforce the Army of
Invasion.
WASHINGTON, June 24.â General
Miles, in command of the army, will
go to Cuba, accompanied by his staff,
and direct the military operations in
the field. The doubt as to the gen
eral's movements was cleared up to
day and the definite statement made
that he would go to Cuba. He will
not leave this week, however, as has
been suggested, nor Is it settled yet
just when he will go. ThÂ«re are im
portant military moves requiring his
attention here, including the prepara
tions for further expeditions which will
go to Cuba to re-enforce General Shaf
ter by way of Newport News and
Tampa. This force will consist in the
aggregate of 18,000 troops. Tampa is
again to be made a rendezvous for a
large force and the department is se
curing complete details, with a view
to centering another large fleet of
transports there. With the troops
moved to these points and the expedi
tions well advanced. General Miles will
then be free to join the army In the
field. There is a possibility that he may
go with General Henry's division when
the Harvard and Yale make their sec
ond trip from Newport News, but this
is quite doubtful.
CAMINETTI HAS NOT
YET BEEN NOMINATED
Opposition of Enemies Causes His
Philippine Job to Be
Held Up.
WASHINGTON, June 24.â The nom
ination of ex-Congressman Camlnetti
as judge advocate general, with the
rank of major, which has been con
fidently expected each day by the Cali
fornia delegation, is held up. It ap
pears that some of Camlnetti's enemies
are opposing him. Senator Perkins
called on the President to-day in refer
ence to the matter, but received no as
surance that the appointment would
be made. Representative Loud stole a
march on Senator Perkins, with whom
he is at war, and succeeded in having
his friend Sargent S. Morton appointed
Receiver of Public Moneys at San
Francisco. The first Perkins knew of
â¢ it was when he saw Morton's name in
to-day's list of nominations. He will
not oppose his confirmation. Morton is
well known in San Francisco, having
been engaged in the draying and trans
fer business there, mixing in politics
occasionally. He has been one of Rep
resentative Loud's stanch supporters.

Correspondence of the Call.
HONOLULU, June 17.â There is weeping
and wailing and especially gnashing of
teeth to-day at Hawaii's bad for
tune with the mails. After patiently
waiting for a whole week for the over
due Peru and ignoring the Vancouvei
route, the postoffice placed all its mail,
16,000 letters and 6000 newspapers, upon the
United States cruiser Bennington, yester
day morning, the Mohican having arrived
the evening before just at sunset. This
morning the Peru turned up for breakfast
and will naturally arrive in San Francisco
some two, if not three, days before the
Bennington, whose voyage will probably
be at least eleven days, as she is re
ported by the quidnuncs to be very foul.
Something had to be done, as the mer
chants are running short of provisions
ajid things that the islands ought to pro
duce, even to potatoes, and ships are
waiting at San Francisco for orders dis
patched yesterday.
It must be remembered that the feeding
of several thousand of extra mouths
make quite a difference to our little com
munity, which relies to a great extent
upon its supplies from the coast. We have
plenty of course for the second bod-," of
troops, which are hourly expected, but not
actually looked for until the 20th. except
that we shall probably run short on beer.
Our arrangements are to feed GOOO troop*
in the Executive building grounds, 3000 at
a time, and after our successful experi
ence with the first SOUO guests we hope to
excel even San Francisco as caterers.
The monitor Monterey, which we have
been anxiously expecting 1 for the last
forty-eight hours, has not yet been sight
ed. She will meet with a warm reception.
The Government and annexatlonists art
highly elated over a dispatch from Minis
ter Hatch from Washington leading them
to hope that the very next steamer will
bring them news that Hawaii has been
gathered into the fold of the great Union.
It is readily to be imagined how, under
these conditions, very unsettled every
thing is in social, business and legislative
circles. The Legislature especially is act
ing peculiarly. It has again evinced its
opposition to Government measures bÂ¥
slaughtering a Ministerial liill to establish
a national labor employment bureau, the
Erincipal man to be benefited by the law
eing, so it is said, one of the officials or
the American League organization.
The most extraordinary reports of "ex
perts" are being presented at this extra
session instead'of, as formerly, in the
regular session, to enable me Legislature
to judge in what manner the departments
and bureaus had been conducted. In no
instance, it is said, do they reflect credit
upon the conduct of the Government dur
ing the past five years. One especiahv â
that in reference to the conduct of the
Public Works Departmentâ has created
intense feeling. The charges "brought

against the Superintendent of Public
â \Yorks are of such a nature that to quote
; from the Advertiser, his defender, they
"if true, cover him wmi public infamy,
! and upon indictment and conviction under
the criminal laws would consign him to
prison." The intensity of the articles of
the Advertiser in defense of Mr. Rowell,
a son of a missionary, a personal protege
of President Dole and a man of most
estimable personal character, and in at
tack on the House Committee, will prob
ably lead to action on the part of the
Legislature or the individual representa
tives of the committee against W. Nevins
Armstrong, the editor. It claims that it
is an attempt to "railroad" a man into
infamy without giving him fair play. The
public is content with saying that if a
tenth of the charges made are true the
: conduct of the department has been crim
inally negligent and outrageous.
It is understood that at the wish of the
President another extra session will be
called by Mr. Dole, at the conclusion of
the present one, unless annexation ensues
in the meantime, as he desires to have the
Legislature in reach in the event of its
services being required for approval of
any amendments suggested by Congress.
The funeral of the late James I. Dowsett
! yesterday was in the nature of a public
one. The Legislature adjourned, and was
represented by special committees in
honor of his past services as Noble and
Councilor.
The Peru, with Captain Coffin, formerly
of the Olympia. was not only quarantined
at Kobe, but had to submit to our curious
i Honolulu quarantine law. That is to say
; that only officials could board her, but ncr
cabin passengers were allowed to land and
freely mix with the shore people.
The Minister of Finance has introduced
a. bill practically relieving that depart
ment or the responsibility ot, tne qipuurse*

have once been transferred to their special
i departments. Hitherto, while having no
I bureaus into which some of the depart
menta are divided, he had to accept the
responsibility of their proper disburse
ment.

CORPSES FOUND IN
THE JANE GRAY'S HOLD
VICTORIA, June 24.â The steamer "Wil
lapa from the West Coast brings the news
that a report has reached Kyuquot that
th*. schooner Jane Gray, which was lost
with thirty-four of her passengers a
month ago, has drifted in on the beach
about ten miles above the village. A large
quantity of her cargo still remained
aboard, and this was being looted by In
dians. In the cargo was a large quantity
of liquor, of which the Indians partook
freely. In their drunkenness they began
to wantonly destroy the cargo.
The report states that a number of
bodies were found in the cabin of the
schooner. The bodies of Missionary Gam
ble and his wife and child were I
locked in each other's arms in their Btate
room. Several other bodies were found
about the deck, lashed in different posi
tions. Police officers will l"' dispatched
to the Coast from Victoria, and as many
of the bodies as can be found will, if pos
sible, be brought to this city.
Cuban Postal Service.
NEW YORK. June 24.â A Washing

soldiers and sailors in Cuba. After this
first shipment of mail the department
hopes to have its old Cuban service re
established by which mail will be taken
from Key West regularly once a week.
The officials are pleased at the pros
pect of having the swift Herald-Call

BAIOUIRi, Cuba, Thursday, 6 P. M. (by Herald-Call
dispatch boat Somers N. Smith, to Port Antonio, Ja
maica, June 24).â This was the situation as the Herald-
Call dispatch boat Somers N. Smith left Baiquiri this
evening :
The Cubans had driven the Spaniards back eight,
miles from the coast. A dozen Spanish blockhouses (
had been burned by the troops as they advanced.
General Lawton had thrown out skirmishers and was
reported to be engaging the enemy.
Roosevelt's rough riders with a dynamite gun were
hurrying forward on foot to support General Lawton.
Three hundred Soaniards had been routed out of
Altares and the Americans were in possession.
Five thousand Cubans under General Rabi and Gen
eral Garcia had been loaded on transports at Aserra
dero, west of Santiago, and landed at Altares to join in
the general movement on Santiago from the east.
Very picturesque was the landing of the Cubans
under the protection of the fleet's guns, with the Span
iards falling back before them. The plan is to put the
Cubans into possession of the city, when the city has
been taken, and leave the American troops free for
Porto Rico and other operations.

UPON SANTIAGO CITY
ON BOARD THE ASSOCI
ATED PRESS DISPATCH
BOAT DAUNTLESS, off Jur
agua, Province of Santiago de
Cuba, Thursday night, June 23,
via Port Antonio, Jamaica, June
24. â The advance of the Ameri
can army has reached the edge of
the tableland on which the har
bor of Santiago de Cuba lies.
Here, seven miles from Morro
Castle as the crow flies, the main
body of troops has united, and
the Spaniards are in full retreat
toward Santiago de Cuba. They
may attempt a surprise, but a de
cisive engagement is not expect
ed for several days.
General Lawton's brigade,
which rested last night at Dema
jayabo, four miles west of Bai
quiri, resumed its march at day
light. Before noon his brigade,
consisting of the Twenty-second
Infantry, the First Infantry, the
Second Massachusetts Volun
teers, with companies of the
Eighth Cavalry, half of the
Fourth Cavalry, and several com
panies of the Twenty-fifth col
ored cavalry, occupied Juragua,
five miles beyond, and the Ameri
can flag was hoisted there.
The Spaniards retired before
the advance, which was covered
by Cuban skirmishers, burning
the blockhouses as they went.
Colonel Wagner, with a small
reconnaissance party of about
forty men, brushed against the
Hank of a retreating Spanish col
umn 200 strong at Firmexa. A
dozen shots were fired by the
Spaniards as Colonel Wagner fell
back. Before General Lawton
could bring up the Twenty-sec
ond, the van regiment, the Span
iards had decamped westward.
Juragua was abandoned by
General Linares and 1200 Span
ish troops with such haste that
they had no time to burn the
town, though an ineffectual at
tempt was made to destroy the
locomotives of the railroad and
the rolling stock. General Lin
ares retreated to Sevilla, six miles
west of Juragua by road and nine
miles from Santiago de Cuba.
A detachment of 170 Cubans,
under Colonel Aguirre, collided
with the Spanish rear guard. The
Cubans lost two men killed and
had seven men wounded. The
Spanish loss is not known. The
Spaniards were macheted.
General ChafFee, with tliQ
Ninth Cavalry, the remainder of
the Eighth and Fourth, Seventh,
Twelfth and Seventeenth Infan
try, reached Juragua at dark.
General Bates, with the reserve of
the Twentieth Infantry and Colo
nel Woods' rough riders, dis
mounted, with a dynamite gun,
hurried forward from Baiquiri at
3 o'clock, proceeding by forced
marches.
Dispatches from General Lina
res which were captured indicated
that the Spanish were ordered to
retreat toward Santiago. The in
surgents expect the first stand to
be made at Sevilla, and they have
proved good prophets in the past.
General Lawton's men are badly
fagged by forced marches and
the intense heat. Their rations
are almost exhausted. They
started with three days' supplies
and further food could not be
landed to-day. A pack train will
be sent forward to-morrow.
Strong outposts are maintained
to-night in order to prevent a
surprise, and Juragua is also un
der the protection of the guns of
the warships. Thus the flank of
the American column is safe. The
Spaniards, to attack our troops,
must make a forced march
through almost impenetrable
underbrush.
There were only two casualties
during the landing of the troops
at Baiquiri. Corporal Cobb and

SPANIARDS REALIZE
CERVERA'S FLEET AND
SfINTIfIGO ARE LOST
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, June 24.â Never
since the commencement of the
war has the anxiety been so in
tense to hear news from Santi
ago. It is recognized that the
successful landing of American
troops is most serious. The
Epoca to-night talks sadly of the
certain destruction of Cervera's
fleet. /
No official report confirms the
rumor of the surrender of Manila.
The Cabinet council meets to
morrow morning. Its results, it
is anticipated, will be of the high
est importance. It is remarked
that the session of Congress sus
pended without any usual loyal
demonstrations.
SANTIAGO MUST BE
TAKEN BEFORE MORE
SPANIARDS ARRIVE
WASHINGTON, June 24.âNotwith
standing the official Spanish reports
of heavy fighting between the Ameri
can invading army and the Spanish
troops near Santiago, army officials
here are confident that no engagement
of any moment has occurred between
these troops. Part of the landing pro
ject was a movement in force by the
Cubans across the country to prevent
the Spanish forces concentrating upon
the beach to oppose the landing of the
American troops. Taken In connection
THE INVESTMENT OF SONTIOGO.
I with Sampson's plan of blinding the
Spanish to the real landing place by
an indiscriminate shelling of the coast
for twenty miles east and west, this
scheme worked admirably so far as the
American troops are concerned, as was
evident by their landing without the
loss of a man. It is suspected, however,
that the Cubans have had to pay for
this exemption on the part of the
Americans, and the engagement de
scribed in the Spanish dispatches was
really between the Cubans and the
Spaniards, far back in the rear, instead
of between the Americans and Span
iards. Seeing that the Cubans, who
were almost without clothing, have
In-on liberally supplied by Sampson and
Sh&fter, it is conceivable that the
Spaniards might easily mistake them
for American soldiers at a little dis
tance. The news coming from Jamaica
that General Pando is sending heavy
re-enforcements to the Spanish General
Linares, in Santiago, is likely to have
the effect of hastening the campaign
against that town by the Americans.
Pando has 10,000 soldiers at Holguln,
less than 100 miles from Santiago. They
are the pick of the Spanish army in
Cuba, and their commander is known
as the fighting general. Were they to
combine with the Spanish force In San
tiago the American campaign would
be very much prolonged and the
task set for our troops would
be much heavier. Two factors have
been relied upon to prevent this com
bination. The first is the very rough
nature of the country between Hol
guln and Santiago, whi h would be ex
ceedingly difficult for troops to cover
in less than four or five days at the
earliest.
The second is the active efforts of the
Cubans to harass the Spaniards on the
march and retard their movements.
With the force they now have in that
country the Cubans could do this very
effectually, but they could scarcely ur
cUrtake to absolutely check the whole
Spanish force of 10,000 men.
The reports from Santiago indicate
thot the Spaniash admiral is usins? his
squadron exactly as was anticipated,
to defend the town from attack by
scldiers in the rear. This only em
phasizes in the mind of army officers
the necessity for speedy action on the
part of the invaders, for with Pando's
men to re-enforce the garrison and
Cervera's squadron in full play the
Spanish would be, from a military
point of view, much stronger than the
combined force of Americans under
Shafter and Cubans under Garcia and
Rabi.
It is believed that considerable reli
ance must be placed upon the American
siege train, for as soon as the heavy
guns are in place on the crest of the
hills it is expected the position of the
Spaniards below, will be exposed to a
heavy fire and they will be obliged to
either surrender or make a desperate
attempt to escape from Santiago har
bor.
No official news came to the War De
partment during office hours from our
army near Santiago. This was a cause
for mild surprise at the department, as
General Shafter has a cable at his com
mand and it was expected he would re
port the measure of success he has at
tained in the debarkation of his army
on Cuban soil and the beginning of
operations against Santiago.
Not hearing from him, the officials
were obliged to rely for information
entirely upon press reports. They
found these highly satisfactory. Sec
retary Alger expressed particular grat
ification at the news that the troops
had reached a point within seven miles
of Morro Castle without encountering
serious resistance. The direction taken
by the troops after their landing at
Baiqulriâ trending generally westward
â is taken in some quarters here to in
dicate a purpose to unite with Samp
son's fleet in an attack on Morro Cas
tle and the other forts at the entrnnce
of Santiago harbor before turning their
attention to the town itself. Once the
forts are captured Sampson with small
boats could reach the mines, and if. as
reported, the Merrimac does not com
pletely obstruct the channel some *>f
the battle-ships may be sent in to deal
with Cervera's squadron in its last re
sort. Something of this kind is believed
to be necessary in order to relieve our
troops from the fire of the Spanish
fleet when they attack Santiago di
rectly. One or two of the big battle
ships, supplemented by a few torpedo
boats, could be relied upon to keep Cer
vera's squadron so fully occupied that
he would have no time to get to the
troops attacking Santiago from the
rear.
With great satisfaction the Navy
Department to-day publishes Samp
son's statement that Hobson and his ;
men are well and not in the line of fire.
It was also noted that Sampson finds
no difficulty In having his Hag of truce
respected, which is gratifying, in view
of the statement coming from Havana
some days ago that there was to be a
lapse into barbarism through the re
fusal of the Spaniards to recognize
flags of truce.

withdrawn.
It is said that about 2000 Spanish

The forts have batteries of old

out of position and destroy the fortifi

On account of the stop at Guahan
the Navy Department, does not expect
to hear of the Charleston's arrival at

probably with Dewey now, or nearing

â¢ays: When the Cortes closed martial
lÂ£.w was proclaimed. The Sagasta Cab
inet will resign and make way for a
new Government, which will open .up
negotiations for peace.
The Madrid correspondent of the Fi

report of an Interview with an ex
member of the Ministry, practically
verifying the Daily Telegraph's -Ma
drid dispatch, and adding:
"Senor Gamazo will be the new Pre
mier, with Senor Salvador at the ex
chequer, and possibly two Silvelaists
will join this Cabinet, which will con

MADRID, Jur. â  24.â The decree of the
Queen Regent the Cortes
was read in the Senate this evening.
Prior to the reading of the decree in
the <"hamber of Deputies, which was
crowded, as wi-re also th" galleries,
Senor Salrnenm, the Republican leader,
hat s. Mi- Hi' hi:- remarks had
been omitted from the official report
ot yesterday's proc< * dings.
The President of the chamber, Mar
quis Vega d'Armijo, said the omission
must lie attributed to the uproar, which
had probably prevented the reporters
from h< ai Ing him.
s. nor Salmeron then said he wished
to have included in the "iiicial report
his declarations throwing the responsi
bility tor all '-!â¢â  misfortunes of the
country upon the monarchy.
Senor Sagasta at this point rose and
read the royai decree suspending par
liament. The chamber then adjourned
and without the customary cheers to
the throne.
it is persistently reported, though the
rumor lacks official confirmation, that
the Government has r â¢ â¢â¢â¢:\.,i a further
dispatch from Manila. The Republican
deputies met t< -night and elaborated a
plan of political action during the sus
pension of the Oortes. Great import
ance is attached to the cabinet council
BUmmoned tor to-morrow (Saturday).
The debate in the Chamber of Depu
ties yesteraay on the Philippine ques
tion was marked by gr^at disorder.
Senor Robledo, ih â  Conservative leader,
attacked General Polavieja, the former
Minister of War. for treating with
AjrulnaJdo. the Insurgent leader, and
was interrupted with shouts of "That
is untrue!" A scene of the greatest con
fusion followed ar. . the sitting was sus
pended.
When business was resumed Senor
Rcbledo continued his remarks, I 1&
asked if the Government desired peace
or war. If peace, he added, Spain had
better negotiate directly with the
United States.
In tho course of lr.s speech Senor Ro
bledo censured tfrc- Minister of Marine
and Admiral Cervera, accusing tho
Minister of having granted unpatriotic
interviews.
Captain Aunon <i. f< nded the navy.
He said Senor Robledo's remarks were
insulting, and he characterized the pub
lished reports of interviews with him
as being "distortions." In consequence
of the latter statement the reporters
left the Chamber of Deputies and only
returned at the close of the Minister's
speech, which concluded with the an
nouncement that Admiral Camara was.
on his way to the Philippines to defend
the Spanish flag.
Another uproar was occasioned by
Senor Salmeron, the Republican
leader, denouncing an attempt to close
the debate. He loudly exclaimed: "It
is an outrage!" and was commencing
an attack on the monarchy when his
voice was drowned by shouts from all
parts of the house.
The uproar continued for some time,
and when order was restored the presi
dent announced that th> Chamber
would meet in secret session to dis
cuss internal affairs. In the lobbies
great excitement was occasioned. Senor
Samper shouted as Benor Salmeron
was leaving the house: "The Republi

servatives severely for the present con
dition of affairs. He said that Senor
Castillo del Canovas said that he be
lieved Cuba could be dominated by
troops, while in reality the island
needed drastic reorganization. The war
policy as well as General Weyler's pol
icy, the speaker asserted, had failed,
and autonomy had proved ineffectual
because it was attempted too late.
However, the Senator explained, the
attempt at autonomy was useful, "as
it will allow Spain to demand a broker's

good attempt."
HOW ADMIRAL SAMPSON
PROTECTED TROOPS
DURING DEBARKATION
WITH THE BLOCKADING FLEET,
OFF SANTIAGO, June 24.â The order
of battle Issued by Admiral Sampson,
who was almost entirely responsible for
the success of the operations in connec
tion with the landing- of troops at BaJ
quiri, was as follows:
The army corps will land to-morrow
morning, the entire force landing at Bai
quiri. The landing will begin at day
light. Ships stationed to the eastward of
Baiquiri will assist in clearing the way
for an unopposed landing by flanking out
the Spanish forces at that point. Simul
taneously with the Bhelllng of the beach
and blockhouses at Baiquiri the Ensenada
de los Altares and Aguadores, both to the
eastward of Santiago, and the small bay
of Cabanas, about two and a half miles
to the westward of Santiago, will be
shelled by the ships stationed there for
that purpose.
A feint of landing In force at Cabanas
will bo made by about ten of the trans
portÃâthe last to disembark their forces
at Baiquiriâ remaining during the day or
a greater part of the day, about two
miles to the southward of Cabanas, low
ering boats and making apparent prep
arations for disembarking a large body
of troops. At the same time Cieneral
Rubi, with 500 Cuban troops, will make a
demonstration on the west side of Ca
banas.
The following vessels are assiened to
bombard the four points mentioned
above: Cabanas, the Scorpion, Vixen and
Texas; Agnadores, the Eagie and Qlou
r; ISnsenada de los Alt&res, the Hor
net, Helena and Bancroft; Baiquiri, the
I>. :r<>it, Castine, Waap and New Orleans,
thÂ« Detroit and Castine on the western
dank and the Wasp and New Orleans on
the eastern Hank.
All the vessels will be In their 'posi
tions at daylight. Great carÂ© will be
taken to avoid the waste of ammunition.
The firing at Baiquiri will begin on a sig
nal from the New Orleans. At Cabanas
it is probable that after a few minutes,
unless the firing is returned, the occa
sional dropping of shots from the smaller
vessels will be sufficient, but the sem
blance of covering a landing should be
maintained.
The same rule, should prevail at Bal
quiri, the point of actual landing. The
vessels will, of course, use their artillery
until they have reason to believe that the
landing is clear. They will take care
that the firing will be deliberate and ef
fective. The Texas and Brooklyn will
exchange blockading stations, the Texas
going inside, to be near Cabanas. The
Brooklyn, Massachusetts, lowa and Ore
gon will keep a vigilant watch on the
harbor mouth. The Indiana will take
the New Orleans' position in the block
ading line east of Santiago de Cuba and
between the flagship New York and the
shore. This is only a temporary assign
ment, the Indiana to . strengthen the
blockading line during the landing and
to avoid any possibility of the enemy
breaking through, should he attempt to
get out of the port.
The Suwanee, Oseeola and Wampatuck
will be prepared to tow boats. -Each
will be provided with two 5 or 6 inch
lines, one on each quarter, and each long
enough to take in tow a dozen or more
boats. These vessels will report at the
New York at 3 a. m.on June 22, prepared
to take in tow the ships' boats, which are
to assist in the landing of troops and to
convoy them to Baiquiri.
The Texas, Brooklyn, Massachusetts,
lowa, Oregon, New York and Indiana
will send all their steam cutters and their
pulling boats, with -the. exception! of one
retained on board each ship, "to assist In
the landing. These boats will report to
the New York at 3 a. m. Each boat,
whaleback and cutter will have three
men, each launch live 'men and- each
steam cutter its full crew ana an officer
for its management. In addition to these
men each - boat will Â» carry five men. In
cluding- one capable of acting as cock
swain to manage and direct me trans
ports' boats. â  Each steam | launch will be
in charge of an officer, who will report to
Captain Goodrich. ; â â¢â 
Care will be taken In the ""i^ction of

Captain C. F. Goodrich commanding

TO TAKE JOHN
CREEDE'S LIFE
Sausalito Poolroom Fight
Almost Culminates in
Murder.
Dramatic Close of an Eventful
Day in the Stronghold of
the Gamblers.
SAUSALITO, June 24.â The trouble
between the rival poolroom forces
nearly culminated in a murder here at
about 6 o'clock this evening when
Trustee A. Sylva drew a pistol on ex-
Marshal John E. Creed, after a fistic
fracas in which Sylva was worsted. A
tragedy was averted only by the inter
p sition of Dr. H. J. Crumpton, who
seized the revolver of his infuriated
colleague at a critical moment and
fired its contents into the waters of the
bay.
The two men had been threatening
to "get together" since 1 o'clock in the
afternoon, when Creed kicked the door
off Broyer, Glynn & Humphrey's pool
room when locked in by Marshal Han
non's deputies. They made various un
complimentary remarks about each
other in the hearing of a number of
persons on t'.ie street and each
threatened to thrash the other. The
two met near Recorder f'mpton's of
fice at about 6 o'clock and got into a
wordy alter.ation, during whicn Sylva,
who is aln.ust a pigmy in comparison
with his opponent, termed Creed an
ex-convict. ,
The ex-marshal promptly gave the lie
and struck Sylva in the face, knocking
him over a pile of dry boxes.
Sylva had partly arisen when he re
ceived ar. Aher blow on the back of the
neck and went to earth again. Quick
as a flash he was on his feet with a re
volver In his hand. Creed had stood
with his hand in his hip pocket, but,
perceiving that Sylva had been too
quick for him, he jumped and grappled
with the frenzied Trustee.
By this time a large crovd was surg
ing around the spot.- Dr. Crumpton ar
rived Just as Creed grappled with*
Sylva and springing forward wrenched
the weapon from Sylva's hand and fired
its five shots Into the bay. The com
batants were separated \ and proceeded
to abuse each other for ' awhile, ; but
were finally forced to leave the spot,"
Deputy Sheriff Thomas , Frost / placed
both 'under arrest for disturbing the
peace and Sylva preferred a charge, of
battery against Creed, who Bays * that
to-morrow ho will place Bylva under
arrest; for assault with Intent to- com
mit murder. :â :â -, : V,

ORDERED THE WESTERN
UNION WIRES CUT
Rash Move of Trustee Sylva That
May Result in a Prosecution
by the Company.
SAUSALITO, June 24.-Just as the clock
struck 1 this afternoon the poolroom sit
uation assumed a new phaseâ a phase so
startling and unexpected that both the
rival forces stood hi groups on the street
and discussed developments for an hour
before it was perfectly understood. For
with the chiming of the clock Deputy
Marshal Chester Johnson, acting under
the advice of Trustee Sylva, walked into
the establishment of Glynn, Brnyer &
Humphrey and proceeded to cut the West
ern Union telegraph wires over which
come the news of the Eastern races.
An hour later there was not a poolroom
in operation in town. Reports were sent
to Western Union headquarters of the
action of the board in cuttin~ the wires,
and on the next boat came City Foreman
J. P. Smith, fully panoplied for decisive
work. First he went to Harvey's and cut
the wires, then to Harrison's, where the
operation was repeated. Telegraph instru
ments were immediately removed from
ADVERTISEMENTS.
X
both places, and the next outgoing boat
took away about half the gambling fra
ternity, as disgusted a set of men as could
be seen in a week's journey. Others re
mained in town to see the next move.
Big John E. Creed. ex-Marshal, who has
been guarding the poolrooms of the San
Mateo contingent, elbowed his way
through the crowd of deputies at the door
and went inside at 1:10 o'clock. When he
attempted to return the door was closed
and locked. Creede drew back his right
Trilby and lifted the door off its hinges.
Creed was arrested on a charge of inter
fering with officers in the uischarge of
their duty and released on his own recog
nizance.
At 2 o'clock the cases of the persons ar
rested on the two precedin"- days were
called in Recorder Simpton's court.
Glynn was held to appear next Wednes
day at 9:30 a. m., the Intention being to
make his a test case. The other cases
will receive no attention until Glynn's is
disposed of. The jury will be impaneled
by Sheriff Harrison on request of Re
corder Simpton.
It now remains to be seen whether the
Western Union will place its wires back
in Harrison's and Harvey's poolrooms,
even if the board finally succeeds in oust
ing the San Mateo contingent, which Sly
va seems confident of doing. Attorneys
Wilkins, Cochrane and Long are equally
as confident that they will lauph last.
To-day's' developments prove that both
sides are determined to win at any cost,
and the trouble may yet reach the Supe
rior Court.
The Western Union people declare they
will not submit to such annoyance and
interference with their vires as was
caused in Sausalito by the action of the
Trustees. They have decided not to re
sume their service while the rooms keep
up such a fight against each other. As to
the prosecution <">f the person or persons
who tampered with the wires they were
not prepared to say what action would
be taken. They now have the matter un
der consideration.
MEN INJURED ON
BATTLE-SHIP TEXAS
Casualties Caused by a Shell From
Socapa Before That Battery-
Was Silenced.
OFF SANTIAGO, Cuba, June 23.â
(By the Associated Press dispatch boat
to Kingston, June 24.)â 1n addition to

RICKETY BUILDINGS
DESTROYED BY FIRE.
THREATENING BLAZE AT MIS
SION AND BEALE STREETS.
The Loss Will Be About $10,000, Di
vided Among Several Establish
ments â Cause Unknown.
Fire broke out at about 12:15 last night
in the rear of the two-story frame build
ing on Beale street, near Mission, and for
a time threatened to destroy an entire
block of wooden buildings.
The fire was first discovered by Officer
Duane of Morse's Patrol Agency and
Special Officer Sample, who turned in the
alarm. It was right in the center of a
nest of half-dilapidated buildings, mostly
filled with inflammable material, and
when the firemen arrived it was found
necessary to turn in a second alarm.
From the Kroagh Company's building
the flames spread to Ktrr's wagon man
ufactory and Peters' blacksmith shop im
mediately adjoining and soon communi
cated with the rear of Heidt's cornice
works, fronting on Mission street, all of
which were badly wrecked and the con
tents destroyed.
When the firemen arrived the buildings
were one mass of rtames, but on the peak
of the cornice company's building flut
tered an American flap:, waving proudly
in the breeze and standing out in bold
relief above the sea of fire. Finally a lit
tle tongue of flame caught the halyards
and Old Glory gave one last flutter as it
fell into a fiery grave, while a cheer went
up from the assembled crowd.
Fire Marshal Towe was unable to def
initely determine the cause, but thinks
it originated from overheated casting
in the rear of Kroagh's establishment.
He will make a thorough investigation.
The loss on the buildings and contents
will amount to about $10,000, and the cor
nice company will be the heaviest loser,
A number of sheet metal statues on the
front of the cornice works were pulled
down to prevent danger of their falling
and injuring passers-by.
When Officer Duane returned from
sending in the alarm some one informed
him that an employe of the cornice
works named Juange was asleep upstairs
in the building. He at once broke open
the door, and although almost overcome
by the stifling volumes of smoke Whicu
had by this time filled the building
rushed upstairs and rescued the sleep
ing occupant.
MAY CARRY
HOSTILITIES
INTO SPAIN
Her Coast Ports Will Be
Attacked if Left Un
protected.
Madrid Blundered if It Ordered
Camara to Sail Through
Suez Canal.
WASHINGTON, June 24.- 1 he war is to
f be carried into Africa, metaphorically speak
7 ing, if Spain is foolhardy enough to send the
â  Cadiz fleet through the Suez canal to attack
â Dewey in the Philippines. It is announced on
â  good authority that before the last Spanish
â  vessel has passed through the canal an
â  American squadron will be steaming at full
a speed across the Atlantic, straight for the
â  coast of Spain, to bring the war home to the
â  Spanish people.
There is no doubt that Dewey can
take care of himself against this Cadiz
fleet since his own squadron will be re
enforced by ironclads long before Ca
mara's ships sight the Bay of Manila,
and he will have the shore batteries
with him instead of against him in the
struggle. But it has been concluded
by the administration that nothing,
save the most severe measures, will
suffice to bring the Spanish people to
a realizing sense of the hopelessness of
the continuance of the present war, and
even kindness, it is held, will dictate
such a blow as that which it is pro
posed to administer if the Spanish per
sist in this last project.
After the fall of Santiago and the
capture or destruction of Cervera's
squadron Sampson will have an abund
ance of vessels to spare for the task set
forth. Probably he will constitute the
attacking fleet in two squadrons, the
first a flying squadron to be composed
of the swiftest vessels of the fleet, such
as the Columbia, Minneapolis, Harvard,
Tale, St. Paul and New Orleans. This
will be followed by another fleet, either
under Sampson or Schley, with the bat
tleships, which C-.ptain Clark's experi
ence with the Oregon has shown can
easily be counted on for the voyage
across the Atlantic.
With the lowa, Oregon, Indiana, Mas
sachusetts ana Texas, all battleships,
supplementing the New York and
Brooklyn, armored cruisers, and the
less powerful but speedy vessels of the
flying squadron, the Spanish coast
would be speedily swept clear of all
commerce, all' Spanish shipping would
be destroyed and some of the best ports
blockaded or bombarded.
CAMARA'S SQUADRON
STILL SAILS EASTWARD
Due to Arrive at the Entrance to Suez
Canal on Monday or
Tuesday.
WASHINGTON. June 24.â The State
Department has just received advices
confirming the report that the Spanish
Cadiz squadron is in the Mediterranean,
moving eastward. The dispatch came
from an agent of the department in
Algiers, and was as follows: "Captain
Moob of the English steamer Hampton
informs me that he passed on the 22d
at 3 p. m., off Pan Tellaria, the Span
ish squadron, bound east, and includ
ing l.fteen f-hips, rome being transports
laden with troops, and three of them
torpedo-boats."
The first report to that effect, which
came through an Italian newspaper,
was taken with some reservation, ow
ing to the known efforts of the Spanish
Government to mislead our naval au
thorities by just such means in friendly
newspapers.
By the reckoning of the naval officers
the squadron should be now nearing
Candia, South of Greece. At the rate it
is progressing the squadron should
reach Port Said, at the entrance to the
Suez canal, about Monday or Tuesday.
There is a question whether the canal
authorities will allow the heavy Span
ish armored ships to risk the passage
of * the canal even tt Admiral Camars
is willing to undertake it. Their draft
of water is so great that they might
easily ground in the canal and thus ob
struct it for navigation indefinitely.
LONDON, June 24.â dispatch to
Lloyds from Algiers confirms the re
port that Admiral Camara's fleet pass
ed the island of Pan Tellaria, going
eastward, on "Wednesday, June 22.

BATTLESHIP PELAYO
NOT WITH CAMARA
LONDON, June 25.â The Rome cor
respondent of the Daily Mail referring
to the reported sailing of Admiral Ca
mara's squadron says:
"Admiral Camara's fleet had flags
flying and vidently desired to be seen.
The Admiralty authorities here be
lieve that the fleet is incomplete. The
battleship Pelayo was not seen, while
there were no transports, and it is
therefore supposed that the squadron
cannot be going to the Philippines."

MERRITT'S PLAN OF CAMPAIGN IN MANILA.
High Estimate Placed Upon the Troops Composing His Commandâ Patriotic
Generosity of San Francisco Appreciated.
Although the work of Major General Wesley Merritt, Governor General of the Philippines, is nearly at an end in San Francisco, yet he will be a very busy man up to the time of
embarkation for Manila on Wednesday next. He will sail on the Newport, a speedy steamer and able to easily overtake the transport fleet, which according to the present programme is to take
its departure next Monday. The Newport will join the fleet before it reaches Honolulu.
Yesterday General Merritt, in the course of a conversation with a representative of The Call, said:
"Everything is moving very smoothly with the command of the Philippine expeditionary forces, both at Camp Merritt and at the Presidio. The command
has made very rapid and marked improvement during the last three weeks, through the efficiency of the officers and the zeal of the men. The troops have been con
stantly and well drilled, and are in excellent condition for active campaign .work.
"I cannot give too much credit to the staff officers, who have been chiefly instrumental in bringing about this much desired result in so short a time.
General Hughes, my inspector general, has been in attendance at Camp Merritt every day and has performed his duties in a most thorough manner. Major Hale,
aid-de-camp on my staff, and Captain Mott have each rendered important services at Camp Merritt, and I think the command has been greatly benefited by the work
they have done.
"The men, without exception, have shown a disposition to learn. While I don't wish to discriminate, I must say that in some of the organizations the
men have manifested even more zeal than some of the officers. But everybody has done well, and there exists to-day a most admirable esprit de corps.
"The prospects are that the whole command will be en route to Manila before many days, as arrangements are now being perfected by the War Depart
ment to carry everybody.
"I shall go withtheexpedition sailing next week because I consider my presence at Manila now of much more importance than it is here. I feel perfectly
safe in taking my departure at this time as the remaining troops, soon to follow me, will be left in good hands. I leave behind me, in charge of these troops, Ma
jor General Otis, Brigadier General Miller, Brigadier General King and Brigadier General H. G. Otis, all of whom are very efficient officers, and are doing every
thing in their power to get the command on a war footing.
"Every organization of the command is now well supplied with arms and ammunition. Furthermore, the command is made up of excellent material,
and if the opportunity offers I feel confident that these men will make a record on the field of battle of which their countrymen may well feel proud.
"I have, of course, mapped out. in a preliminary way, a system of government for the Philippines, but my plans may be somewhat changed owing to cir
cumstances that may arise after my arrival at Manila. The necessities of the immediate situation must be taken into consideration, and, of course, I cannot be
come acquainted with those necessities until after I reach the Philippines. The Philippine enterprise is a new venture with the United States, and while the final
disposition of the territory is, of course, problematical at this time, the first thing to be done is to bring order out of chaos. As yet there is nothing so mature as
to permit me to make any castiron plans.
" I do not anticipate any serious difficulty in adjusting affairs with the insurgents under Aguinaldo, who, according to advices as published in the news
papers and other information in my possession, are keeping in close touch with Admiral Dewey.
"I have informed myself as much as possible at this distance from the scene of action as to the laws, customs, commerce, climate and resources of the
Philippines. For this I have depended almost wholly upon staff officers who were especially engaged in gathering everything available, and they have collected
a mass of valuable information, properly digested.
"I take great pleasure in saying that the people of San Francisco and California have done everything in their power to make most pleasant our stay in
the city. This is especially true of the benevolent societies. I have never seen such generous hospitality displayed anywhere as there has been in San Francisco. It
is something to be proud of* It has certainly infused a chivalrous and gentlemanly spirit among the men, who have conducted themselves in a most orderly man
ner. The dispensers of this hospitality seemed to know just where to do their good work so that it would benefit the men needing and deserving it. I hope and
believe that the kindness of these people has been well bestowed, and that it will be rewarded by our future conduct. We shall carry away with us the most pleasant
recollections of the hospitable city at the Golden Gate. If, upon our return, we shall receive as hearty a reception as our entertainment has been generous we
shall all feel amply compensated for whatever we may have accomplished."

DOES ALGER PLOT
MERRITT'S DOWNFALL?
Weird Rumor That Troops Will Be
Withheld From the
General.
There Is a rumor current In the lnner
moot army circles of Washingtonâ a
whisper of which has reached here
through a member of the charmed circle
âwhich, if true, may have much to do
with the Philippine expeditionary forces
and upset completely the carefully la,in
plans of General Merritt. if It does not
wreck the success of the great undertak
ing.
The rumor has to do with the ill-feeling
that is known to exist and has existed
between Secretary of War Alger and
General Merritt ever since the war of the
rebellion. An old story is revived of an
act on the part of Secretary Alger, then
an officer in the volunteer army, which
nearly resulted in his having to face the
ordeal of a court-martial. General Merritt
being one of those most Insistent upon his
punishment.
Through the long years of peace that
followed, Alger could only nurse his ani
mosity and wait. Even after he assumed
the direction of the army as Secretary of
War no opportunity presented itself for
him to show the general that he still re
membered the affair of a third of a cen
tury ago, until war with Spain broke out
and Dewey scored the first great victory
of the struggle.
Then, according to the tongue of Dame
Gossip, the Secretary fancied he saw an
opportunity to even up the old score â an
opportunity of which he lost no time in
taking advantage. The capture of the
Philippinesâ then an unknown quantity
necessitated their occupancy, at least
until the close of the war. The busy jade, |
Rumor, proceeds to lay bare the Becret
thoughts and plans of Secretary Alger for
the discomfiture of his old-time enemy,
as follows:
With Dewey's fleet In possession of the
harbor, Alget- figured that it would re
quire an insignificant land force to hold !
the islands, and it would be a master j
stroke to place Merritt in command and
Uuis shut him out from all chance of
sharing in the glory of an active cam
paign against the enemy. General Mer
ritt in due time was named as the heatf
of the expedition, but here the Secre
tary's plans miscarried.
Daily the Philippines grew in impor
tance, and the possibilities for the mem
bers of the invading army increased.
Hints of trouble with Germany over
their final disposition., together with grow
ing talk of their permanent occupancy by
the United States, added to the importance
of the command and lessened the punish
ment of Merritt proportionately. Still he
had been appointed to the position and
there seemed to be no way to prevent him
from reaping as much, or more, glory as
those who led the forces in Cuba,
But Alger still hoped, and, hoping, re
newed his scheming. The general had de
manded an adequate force to carry out
the plans of the administration and his
demands had been acceded to, but when
it came to moving his troops the Question
4>
<3><S'<S><s><Â§><e><S><S><3><3><S><3><3><s> < Â«><3> < j>4 >< 5>5 >
of transports cut a commanding figure
and caused many vexatious delays. But
eventually General Merritt succeeded in
getthig- two expeditions off and ships to
carry enough more troops to make up
about half the force assigned to his com
manci.
One day the general announced that he
Env accompany the third expedition,
leaving General Otis to dispatch the re
mainder of his forces as rapidly as pos
sible A number of ships would" be avail
able by the middle of July to transport
the bulk of the troops, and General Mer
ritt was anxious to reach the scene of his
operations and begin the establishment of
a military government at the earliest pos
sible day.
When this announcement reached
Washington Secretary Alger saw in it
another opportunity to accomplish the un
doing of Merritt. His plan was nothing
less than to stop the forwarding of re
enforcements, leaving Merritt with half
the force he had been promised. This
would naturally prevent him from doing
anything more than to occupy Manila.
He could not undertake a campaign
against the enemy if it retreated beyond
range of Dewey's guns, nor could he even
cope with the insurgents under Aguinaldo
should they rebel against American sov
ereignty in the islands. Consequently, his
campaign would prove a failure, and Mer
ritt would be a fallen hero in the eyes of
his countrymen.
Such ts the rumor that has traveled
across the continent. If Merritt sails with
the third expedition not another man is
to follow him if Alger can prevent it.
Wild as it may seem, there still remains
the fact that since the close of the Re
bellion Alger and Merritt have been any
thing but friends.

ThJE INSULT TO HOBSON.
WHEN the Examiner published a fake letter al
leged to have been written by Lieutenant
Hobson it was guilty of a crime blacker than
ordinarily characterizes its columns of bogus news.
People have grown accustomed to being swindled by
that paper. They regard its impositions as something
in the nature of a joke and take up the sheet with
daily wonder as to what form of confidence game it
will be found practicing. So thoroughly discredited
has the Examiner become that it has in a great
measure lost its power to do harm. But when its
heralded information is not only false but vicious
there is a tendency to resent it.
The Hobson letter was an affront against decency,
and particularly against that gallant gentleman him
self. It made him pose as a braggart and a crack
brained, self-glorifying ninny. While for a moment
it might have misled a thoughtless reader, it could
not even temporarily have deceived a newspaper
man, and any newspaper man giving it unqualified
publicity must have been guilty of deliberate effort
to defraud. Not only did the subject matter of the
letter betray its real quality, but other circumstances
stamped it as a stupid pretense.
There was no possibility that such a letter could
have been received, no possibility that having been
received it would have been turned over to the press.
It was so clearly the product of a liar that no excuse
can be offered by the Examiner for having presented
it as legitimate. The correspondent dishonors the
profession. He deserves to be barred. Yet such cor
respondents could not flourish to the damage of the
craft were there not unclean, conscienceless, yellow
journals ready to give currency to anything savoring
of sensation. Such a journal is the Examiner.
INTERNATIONAL AMERICAN BANK-
ONE of the larger measures affecting our peace
ful interests which Congress has found time to
discuss among the excitements of war is the
bill providing for the establishment of an international
American bank. The object of the measure is to pro
vide a means for facilitating commerce among the
countries of this hemisphere, and it is therefore a step
toward accomplishing that great scheme of Pan-
Americanism which survives as an evidence of the
creative statesmanship of Blame.
The bill has met the usual Democratic and Popu
listic antagonism. It is a financial measure not of
their making, and therefore they shy at it. It does
not undertake the free coinage of silver, nor an un
limited issue of greenbacks, and therefore they op
pose it. It is not a fiat money scheme in any par
ticular, but a plan for promoting commerce by fur
nishing a safe means for transacting legitimate mone
tary affairs and the settlement of balances among
merchants of the different American countries, and
therefore it appears to the wild imaginations of the
fiatists as another conspiracy on the part of the gold
monster to press a crown of thorns upon the brow of
labor and crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.
Our Consuls in the various Central and South
American countries have repeatedly pointed out that
one of the serious disadvantages under which our
manufacturers and merchants operate in those mar
kets is due to the lack of American banking facili
ties there. Bankers of Great Britain and of Germany
have extensive agencies in all the principal cities, and
their influence is exerted to encourage the imports
of the goods of their own country. To meet this ad
verse influence we must provide American banks, and
this can be done better by the co-operation of cap
italists in forming one great financial institution than
by separate efforts on the part of many.
While it is gratifying that Congress has been able
in a time of war to give attention to this measure of
peaceful commercial enterprise, it would be more sat
isfactory if the subject of Pan-American commerce
had been taken up as a whole and not by piecemeal.
The need of an international bank to facilitate trade
is great, but the need of ships to carry it on is even
greater. The British and the Germans in seeking a
market for their products in this hemisphere have
not contented themselves with providing banking
conveniences for their merchants and their customers.
They have provided ships to carry the goods and have
pranted liberal subsidies to maintain the shipping.
We must do likewise if we hope to succeed in win
ning the markets from them.
No occasion for alarm is constituted by the report
that the Cadiz fleet is bound for the Philippines.
Even if it could get there Dewey could defeat it
without calculating on the help of the Charleston
and the Monterey.
There can be no objection to Blanco's hurling de
fiances, as dispatches say he is doing. He doubtless
feels in duty bound to hurl something:
ANNEXATION INSTRUCTIONS.
BECAUSE Senator White has, from the incep
tion of the issue, stood against the reception
of Hawaii as a, gift from Dole, incumbered
only by his $5,000,000 debt and 30,000 coolies, it has
pleased the annexation organs to fling at him the
resolutions passed by the Legislature which elected
him.
Whenever The Call has explained this matter it has
also pleased the same organs to say that this paper
is Senator White's organ. Of course their instant de
fense of Democratic members of Congress who vote
for annexation is not "orgrnic" at all. The facts are
that the Legislature which elected Senator White did
pass a resolution favoring the annexation of Hawaii
by "honorable means." As such means have not yet
been used, he would be absolved from obedience
any way. It is not honorable to attempt to annex the
country against the protest of a large majority of
its people. When such plan fails by treaty it is not
honorable to violate the constitution by annexing a
separate sovereignty by a joint resolution. It is not
honorable to pretend that the latter method follows
the Texas precedent. Texas was never annexed. It
was admitted directly into the Union as a State, after
the issue had been submitted to and indorsed by the
people of that sovereignty. But what of the legisla
tive mind and will on this subject?
Senator Perkins was elected by the Legislature of
1895, two years after Senator White's election. An
annexation resolution was introduced in the Senate
of that Legislature and was beaten by a vote of nine
to twenty-two! Every Democrat and a majority of
the Republicans voted against it. If there is binding
force in legislative instruction to Senators of the
United States, this last expression of the legislative
will would bind both of our Senators. While it suits
the organs of the Hawaiian sugar planters and coolie
labor to attack Senator White for not obeying the
legislative will of 1893, it suits the same organs to
cordially support Senator Perkins for not obeying
the legislative will of 1895.
In this same connection the Oakland Enquirer has
had somethingto say about newspaper sentiment toward
Senator White, to the effect that a Republican paper
in Los Angeles is indorsing him for the purpose of
his return to the Senate and at the same time desires
to elect Mr. Henry T. Gage" of Los Angeles, a Re
publican, for Governor. It is added that the Los
Angeles paper is thereby showing servile zeal for its
attorney and its leading stockholder.
The Call wants a Republican Senator and a Re
publican Governor, but when servile zeal is mentioned
we cannot withhold the reflection that the Enquirer
is zealous for a candidate for Governor who is also
largely interested in its ownership. While he daily
records his good opinion of himself in his own paper
he should not point the finger of scorn â or, in fact,
any finger at all â at others who may try to reach
their ambitions by owning "organs."
A LESSON OF THE WAR.
AN important lesson is to be learned by the Gov
ernment and the people of the United States
from the difficulty and delay that have been
experienced in providing sustenance and equipments
for the troops enlisted for the war. In the camps on
both the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts the sup
plies have been insufficient and the resultant evil
serious.
Much of the complaint and criticism have doubt
less been exaggerated by sensational journals, but
when due allowance is made for that distortion there
remains enough to justify earnest consideration of
the subject. All the critics have not been irrespon
sible persons. General Miles himself has officially
condemned the manner in which the troops at Tampa
and other Floridian camps have been left without
sufficient supplies, and in all probability the officers
in command on this coast have been tempted at times
to send similar communications to the Government.
It is well known that many of the most needed sup
plies for the camps in this city have been provided by
the voluntary efforts of the women of the Red Cross,
and while their action is highly creditable to them,
it is to be regretted the necessity for it should have
arisen.
The blame for the situation does not rest upon the
administration nor upon any of our official authori
ties. The evil has been the result of the system, or
lack of system, provided by Congress for the manage
ment of our armies. We have beefl so sanguine of
the permanent continuance of peace that we have
made no provisions for war on a large scale. The
superb administrative machinery built up during the
Civil War, which enabled the Government to main
tain; and supply an army of a million of men, has
long since been broken down and abolished. We
entered this war, therefore, rich in every sort of sup
plies, but without the means of making prompt use of
them.
The condition of our war legislation may be es
timated from the fact that the United States statutes
to-day provide that: "Every citizen shall â¢ * *
be constantly provided with a good musket or fire
lock of a bore sufficient for balls of an eighteenth
part of a pound * * * two spare flints * * *
with a good rifle shot pouch and powder horn * * *
and a quarter of a pound of powder. * *â  * Each
commissioned officer shall be armed with a sword or
hanger and a spontoon."
That was the war regulation of the period of the
Revolution. It was a part of the scheme adopted by
Washington and his colleagues in the making of the
nation to keep the country prepared for the possibility
of war. We have kept the letter on tne statute book
but have lost the spirit that made the letter valu
able. It is time now to revive the intent and mean
ing of that old law of the fathers. We must adopt
regulations which will at all times maintain the na
tion in readiness for conflict and clothe the Govern
ment with power at any moment to make full use of
the vast resources of the people for the equipment
and supply of its troops as fast as volunteers muster
to the colors.
Mrs. John White is in jail for the offense of throw
ing her boy out into the cold, and wtth due defer
ence to her sex, it is proper to hope that she may
stay there until the boy shall be big enough to defend
himself.
Probably Spaniards will claim victory as long as
they have breath In their bodies, and the death of
those who are killed will be ascribed to the joy of
triumph.
It is difficult to keep track of the Kaiser the way
the correspondents toss him around from a posi
tion of friendly neutrality to an attitude distinctly
hostile.
Two of McKinley's nephews have enlisted without
waiting for commissions. Some years ago a dis
tinguished uncle of theirs did the same thing.
After a while the Spanish will be in a corner and
be obliged to fight under the disadvantage of being
winded by a long sprint
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 25, 1898.
THE report of the Grand Jury upon the "cause
less delays" and "wanton waste" which have
characterized the execution" of the contract for
the construction of the Hall of Justice at Kearny
and Washington streets can be regarded, though a
grave document, in no other than a serio-comic light.
The present Grand Jury is not the first that has regis
tered a protest against the delays, nor are the present
Supervisors the only ones who have been bam
boozled by the contractors. Again and again, for
upward of three years, grand juries and Supervisors
have tried to straighten this matter out, with no more
success than will probably follow the latest effort.
The truth probably is that Bateman Brothersâ
whose political pull is evidently one of the great in
stitutions of the town â took the contract too low and
are unable to execute it. Surely under prevailing cir
cumstances it cannot be a source of profit to them.
Men have been known to make money by keeping
close to boards and Supervisors, but never while
hanging around them asking for time extensions on
bad contracts. If Bateman Brothers are getting rich
constructing the Hall of Justice it is not apparent
where the money is coming from. The contract may
be "salted" in some way, or retaining control of it
may contribute to their political influence, but as a
business proposition the whole thing must necessarily
be a howling farce.
Why, it may then be asked, do not the contractors
let go? No one has yet been able to answer this
question. Two or three grand juries have "reported"
upon the phenomenon, large numbers of property
owners have "investigated" it and on numberless
occasions Supervisors' committees have traversed the
subject; yet nobody has discovered why the con
tractors do not throw up their job and let somebody
else construct the Hall of Justice. We think it would
be well to give attention to this branch of the diffi
culty. If it cannot be determined why Bateman
Brothers persist in preventing the completion of the
building, would it not be a good idea to form some
plan for kicking them out and putting in charge a
builder who will at least make a bluff at it? This re
sult would justify a lawsuit.
One great point, however, has been settled by the
Grand Jury report under consideration. It is com
prised in a single sentence: "We found," says the
jury to Judge Belcher, "that the architect up to June
13 has been paid $8618 on progress estimates of
$105,600, and that during the whole period of inac
tivity a superintendent was employed at a salary of
$250 a month and an inspector of bricks at $5 per
day â receiving $4375 and $1700 each respectively up
to this date."
We have assumed that no person was deriving ben
efit "from the delay in completing the structure. This
shows that we have been mistaken. An architect,
superintendent and brick inspector are making money.
The gratifying nature of this information can scarcely
be overestimated. The protesting property-owners,
indignant grand jurors and bamboozled Supervisors
may now hide their diminished heads. The con
spicuous purpose of all Government work is being
subserved in the case of the Haul of Justice. Three
tax eaters are getting fattened out of it.~ Let the delay
continue. It is the duty of the city to fat its tax
eaters. Even in this case the end justifies the means.
SPEAKER REED'S bold and statesmanlike
stand against the unreasoning course of the
Hawaiian annexationists has drawn upon him
self the adverse criticism of a whole host of talkers
and scribblers. The criticisms as a rule hardly
amount to a direct attack. The critics content them
selves with pecking at him, finding a little fault here,
a little defect there, and questioning his motives and
his manners.
Among these pecking critics is a bolder one â the
Chicage Inter Ocean. It advances the theory that
the opposition of the Speaker to the annexation
scheme is the outcome of a personal spite against the
President. It declares he has fallen in public esti
mation, that he has lost the confidence even of his
own constituents, calls his present situation a "mourn
ful one," and says, "It illustrates too clearly the fate
bound to overtake the man who tries to subordinate
the interests of the American people to the ends of
personal spleen."
This exhibition of criticism gone daft is cited to
show the extent of the delirium which has taken pos
session of those who have given themselves over to
the mania for territorial aggrandizement, reckless of
the consequences and careless of the method. In its
sober senses the Inter Ocean knows that rarely in our
history has any man ever held a higher place in pol
itics or in public esteem than that now occupied by
Tom Reed. He has in a measure reconstructed Con
gress, has changed it from a wrangling debating so
ciety, disorderly and ineffective, into the most effi
cient legislative body on the globe. His easy mastery
over its mutinous factions has never been more strik
ingly demonstrated than during the present session,
and the loyalty of his party to him as evinced by the
representatives of the party in the house was never
stronger.
When a cause can be supported only by alleging
that such a man as Speaker Reed Is actuated in a
grave issue of national interest by petty spite and per
sonal spleen, that cause is a bad one. Moreover,
there will be a widespread belief that those who make
such allegations are themselves given over to spite.
The spectacle presented by the Inter Ocean is a
mournful one. It illustrates too clearly the fate
bound to overtake a newspaper that subordinates the
Interests of the American people to the ends of per
sonal spleen.
According to the growing strictness of the inter
pretation of laws concerning registration a man will
soon be required to swear that his father was never
related to anybody who knew anybody who had
speaking acquaintance with anybody born in a for
eign land.
The penalty for shooting a Stockton attorney was
fixed at $ioo. It can hardly be thought that such
a paltry sum represented anything like adequate pun
ishment for the crime of attempted murder. Per
haps it was intended as a fine for the failure.
There are several reasons why the Chinese habit
of murder should be checked. It gives the town a
bad name, and some of the assassins are likely to
shoot wild, to the detriment of the passerby.
Sausalito gamblers continue to fight each other,
and a strange tendency to discourage them seems
to have developed. A war of mutual extermination
would be a blessing.
An evening paper hints at the danger of bom
bardment threatening San Francisco. Yet it might
have found important things to think about.
It may be noticed that the attempt to discredit
Miles does not receive any sympathy in the West,
, where the general is best known.
THE HAUL OF JUSTICE.

the happiest man
â s-vwyvrrvwww jn this city. An
hour later he was the saddest, and there
by hangs a tale.
When the season closed here Benjamin
determined to go to Montana and keep an
eye on the horses in that far-off country,
but he could not satisfy himself that it
was necessary for him to purchase a rail
road ticket to get there. All the influence
that his friends possessed was ineffica
cious to secure the much desired pass for
the trip. The twelve labors of Hercules
were mere insignificant undertakings
compared with the efforts of "Benny's"
friends to soften the stony : heart of the
S. P. At last a real friend came to his
rescue. He gave Benjamin a note !to W.
H. Mills of the Southern Pacific, in which
a pass was asked for, and in return a
promise was made to publish an "ad" for
the S. P. in the paper of which the friend
is the editor. Mr. Mills received Benja
min with the utmost courtesy and *o
show his magnanimity he waived, the of
fer of the editor and told Benny that he
would : give the pass to Montague as a
mere act of friendship. He also said that
he would unhesitatingly fill out a pass to
Portland , . but : the : interstate law . prevent
ed him. Benny, thought, that this was all
right, that the charges from Montague to
Portland were a mere trifle, so he accept
ed the pass : and after, effusive thanks
givings, he left the S. P. building with
glistening eye and swelling chest, â¢: ready
to start for j Portland on the first I train.
Walking up the street he met a railroad
man., Wiis joy was so great that he im
mediately told I his j good fortune, wonder
ing why some people say the S. P. is not
charitable. The railroad man smiled and
proceeded to - question the pass-holder on
geography and rates. Then Benny dis
covered that the fare from Montague,
which is on the State line, to Portland is
$12, and that the rate from this city. to the
metropolis of Oregon is only â  $11 with
berth. For a minute the life of Hon. W. H.
Mills was in jeopardy, and there will be
a warm time . when Benjamin meets that
gentleman. The racing authority is still

BASIS OF ENGLAND'S AMITY.
Considering that England's purchases
from us are actually essential to her ex
istence, we find in that one fact alone suf
ficient reason for Great Britain's keen
interest in, and strong friendship for, us.
For Great Britain to be summarily cut off
from receiving our food stuffs, would be
the worst blow that could be inflicted
upon that nation. If we were involved in
a war with Continental Europe, and they
should effectively blockade our ports, it
would be Great Britain, and n#t the
United States, that would be at the mercy
of our enemies. Of somewhat secondary,
but of very great incidental importance,
would be the loss of employment that
would fall upon British manufacturers
and their employes, if they were deprived
of the raw materials which they purchase
from us in such prodigious quantities.
Fully two-thirds of our foreign carrying
is done by British ships. Probably fully
one-third of the entire British shipping:
in the foreign trade is employ ed in the
carriage of our imports and exports. Were
this shipping cut off, summarily and com
pletely, from this trade, "the losses it
would inflict upon British shipowners and
the great mass of the Britsh people would
be fearful. When we reflect upon these
materialâ actually vitalâ considerations,
which compel Great Britain to become
and to remain our stanch friend and
faithful ally, we find that, whether her
heart is in the alliance or not, her inter
ests are so bound up in our well being
that a suspension of trade relations with
this country for a protracted period might
inflict injuries upon Great Britain which
she might not be able to survive. Let us
not beguile ourselves, therefore, nor be
beguiled as a nation, into believing that
Great Britain's interest in the United
States is wholly sentimental.â Seaboard.
HOBSON'S CHOICE,
â â â
His to do and never ask,
What the peril of the task.
His to brave the sullen foe.
His to strike the daring blow.
That was Hobson'a choice.
Down into the Jaws of Death,
In the battle's scorching breath.
Went he with his sturdy crew,
Nor the danger never knew.
This was Hobson's choice.
His to face the screaming shell.
Face It bravely, face it â well.
Playing for a glorious stake.
Risking all for country's sake.
This was Hobson's choice.

This old saw bo lowly born.
But whene'er you chance to hear
The old thing get up and cheer
For Hobson's choice.

BRANCH MINTSâ A. M.. City. Tha
parent mint is in Philadelphia. In 1835
branch mints were established at New
Orleans, at Charlotte, N. C., and at Dah
lonega, Ga.; in 1552 at San Francisco, in
1564 at Dallas, Or., and in 1870 at Carson
City, Nev. Assay offices were established
at New York in 1554, at Denver, Colo., in
1564, and at Boise City, Idaho, in 1872.
These were considered branches of the
Philadelphia Mint until 1573, when the
coinage act of that year made them sep
arate mints and assay offices. These
mints are bureaus of the Treasury De
partment, and are all under the general
supervision of the chief officer of that
department. The mints at Charlotte and
Dahlonega were suspended in 1861, that
of Dallas in 1875, that of New Orleans
from 1860 to 1879 and that of Carson City
in ISSS. The demands of commerce re
quire the maintaining of the number of
branch mints now in operation. '*-;. : ;V-":V

As to exercising the animals, Major

THEY WANT TO TELL
These Grateful "Women Who Have
Been Helped by Mrs. Pinkham.
Women who have suffered severely
and been relieved of their ills by Mrs.
Pinkham's advice and medicine are
constantly urging publication of their
statements for the benefit of other wo-
gnen. Here are two such letters:
Mrs. Lizzie Beverly, 258 Merrimao
St., Lowell, Mass., writes:
" It affords me great pleasure to tell
all suffering women of the benefit I have
received from taking Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound. I can hard-
ly find words to express my gratitude for
Â«vhat she has done forme. My trouble
was ulceration of the womb. I was un-
der the doctor's care. Upon examina-
tion he found fifteen very large ulcers,
but he failed to do me good. I took sev-
eral bo ttlesof Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound, also used the Sanative
Wash, and am cured. Mrs. Pinkhams
medicine saved my life, and I would
recommend it to all suffering women."
Mrs. Amos Trombleay, Ellenburgh
Ctr., N. V.. writes:
M I took cold at the time my baby
was born, causing me to have milk
legs, and was sick in bed for eight
weeks. Doctors did me no good. I
surely thought I would die. I was al-
bo troubled with falling of the womb.
I could not eat, had faint spells as
often as ten times a day. One day a
lady came to see nre and told me of the
benefit Bhe had derived from taking
Lydia E. Pinkham's medicine, and ad-
rised me to try it. I did so, and had
taken only half a bottle before I was
able to sit in a chair. After taking
three bottles I could do my own work.
| am now in perfect health."

Calvary Presbyterian Church gave the
soldiers at Camp Merritt a very enjoyable
time. Several hundred men were enter
tained in the large rooms of the Christian

Church, after which refreshments were
served.
The Manila Signal Corps, in command of

Lieutenant Rudd arrived from St. Paul

officers, they received a hearty wel
come.
The Washington volunteers who enlist

: regiment for active service at the front.
With the departure of the third Manila
expedition next week there will have
been sent from San Francisco nearly 12,
000 troops, leaving about 8000 to be trans
ported to the Philippines. Twenty thou
sand troops constitute the command of
| General Merritt. Whether he will need
any more remains to be seeen. In the
movement of troops the Pacific Coast,
with its limited transportation facilities,
has done nearly as well as the Atlantic,
where there are more than fifty times as
i many vessels to draw from. So far there
I have been chartered in San Francisco flf-
I teen vessels, of which thirteen are now

LEES FOOLS
WITH THE
ARMY AGAIN
Disastrous Encounter
With Col. Smith.
GETS THE USUAL REBUKE
THE CHIEF'S UNDOING CON
NIVED AT BY WITTMAN.
An Unwarranted Slur on the South
ern Troops Which Is Promptly-
Refuted by Undeniable
Authority.
Chief Lees has "monkeyed with the
buzzsaw" again, and, of course, has
contributed some more of his anatomy
to the waste pile.
Years ago, before the brain of the
Chief showed signs of senility, he did
not need to have a lesson repeated to
him; once was sufficient. But with the
constant ravages of time on his mental
faculties the venerable thief-taker can
not remember to-day the disciplining
of yesterday, which is most disastrous,
for each day brings discomfiture to the
old man.
Just at present the army Is the buzz
saw from which Chief Lees persists in
trying to pull the teeth. Already he
has forgotten his unhappy half hour
with General Otis, and yesterday he
went against Colonel Smith of the First
Tennessee. Possibly a misty remem
brance of the Otis interview flitted
through his remnant of mind, for in
stead of bearding the lion in his den
Lees detailed Sergeant Perrin to re
ceive the brunt of the affray.
Perhaps the Chief is not altogether
at fault for the latest rebuke he has
brought upon himself; it would appear
that Captain Wittmanâ he of the frosty
feet and clamy hands â led him to ex
pose his person to the military boot. If
so it was a mean advantage to take of
the helpless old man, and Is not cal
culated to advance his chances of suc
ceeding to the throne of the "upper of
fice."
However, by to-morrow Lees will
have forgotten all about his affair with
the Southern officer, and will lapse into
his old day dream of bygone days, with
their gorgeous processions, headed by
Lees, bedecked with gold lace till
Butcher "Weyler would machete him
self through sheer envy.
The cause of the Chief's trouble was
a letter signed by one George R. Lewis,
who complained to Wlttman that he
had been ill treated by one or two sol
diers, "who by looks were the Tennes
see soldiers." Wlttman turned the
communication over to Lees, with an
addendum, and the Chief sent it to
Colonel Smith by Sergeant Perrin.
Instead of an abject apology and ax.
assurance that a dozen or two of tht
command would be shot at sunrise as
an example, the Chief received In re
ply the following, which needs no com
ment:
Headquarters First Infantry, Tennessee
Volunteers.
CAMP MERRITT, San Francisco, June
23, IWB.â To the Chief of Police, San
Franciscoâ Sir: I have the honor to uc- :
knowledge the receipt by the hand of Ser
geant Perrin of your force of a communi
cation addressed to you by one George R.
Lewis, making complaint of having re
ceived bad treatment at the hands of one,
or two soldiers "in blue uniforms who by
looks was the Tennessee soldiers."
In reply I beg to say that there are
hundreds of soldiers other than Tennes
seeans in San Francisco at the present
time who wear the blue, and while I do
not claim for the members of the Ten
nessee regiment absolute freedom from
fault, I am unwilling that every case of
disorder or disagreement with the col
ored element of your city shall be
charged to Tennesseeans.
The members of this command are
amenable to the laws of this State and
city like any other citizen, and when they
become violators of the State and city
laws I hope you will arrest them, that
they may be brought to punishment.
In this connection I beg to say that my
attention has been directed to an Inci
dent that occurred some two or three
days ago, In which two soldiers of this
command were grossly insulted and
characterized as Southern â â â , and
when these two soldiers remonstrated
about the use of such language they
were set upon and assaulted by
quite a number of negro toughs urmeJ
with razors. I had this matter investi
gated, and found that the negroes were
the aggressors and had provoked the dif
ficulty.
I beg to assure you that no effort will
be spared by the officers of this com
mand to prevent these unpleasant oc
currences, but I hope that all the diffi
culties between the white troops who
wear the blue and the negroes of your
city will not be charged to my regiment,
simply because they are Tennesseeans. In
the city from which this regiment comes
there are many negroes, between whom
and the soldiers of Tennessee the most
kindly feeling exists, and the members
of this command will continue to be law
abiding citizens and do their duty as
soldiers and gentlemen, as they have al
ways done in Tennesseeâ not because it
may be especially popular here, as sug
gested in the note of Mr. George
W. Wittman, Captain of Polico,
in transmitting the letter of complaint,
but because it is right that they should
conduct themselves as respectable gen
tlemen and as the representatives of a
loyal and honored State in the brother
hood of States. Respectfully,
WILLIAM C. SMITH,
Colonel First Infantry, Tennessee Volun
teers.

OREGON'S OFFICIAL ROSTER.
A Patriotic Lady Provides a Pretty
and Valuable Souvenir.
A patriotic Oregon lady, Amelle do F.
Smith, haa published a very pretty pam
phlet, containing the official roster of the
Oregon volunteers. The work is dedicated
to the Second Regiment Oregon Volunteer
Infantry of the Volunteer Army of the j
United States. It is embellished with the
portraits of the Governor and his staff, !
Brigadier General Beebe and his staff,
Colonel Summers of the Second Oregon '
Volunteers and staff,, and many handsome
pictures showing the officers and enlisted ;
men engaged in active camp duty. A
feature of the work consists of fac-simlle
autographs of ell officers and men whose
names are Included in the roster. The au
thor and compiler has expended much
tabor and care in preparing the roster,
and the result is a very pleasing and valu
able souvenir.
DOING GARRISON DUTY.
The First Battalion of Wash-
ington Volunteers Quartered
at the Presidio Barracks.
The First Battalion of the Washington !
volunteers, consisting of four companies
two from Seattle, one from Spokane and
one from Yakimaâ has moved from its
quarters in the Fontana warehouse to the

the lower parade grounds. This battalion
of Washington volunteers, in command of
Major J. J. Weisenberger, will begin full .
garrison work to-day.
A Successful Opening.
During the whole of last evening
throngs of friends and sightseers gen
erally inspected the new clothing store
at the corner of Market street and
Grant avenue. Mr. Gildea, the proprie
tor, at whose invitation the public was !
present, threw open his doors that all
might eea how complete an j
ment he has and how fully equipped he !
is to furnish the latest garments in
men's, boys' and children's clothing.
Thia morning \t 8 o'clock this new en
terprise starts upon an active business
career. Mr. Gildea has for years been '
identified with the clothing trade of this !
city and a w .c acquaintance with i
purchasers gives a positive assurance i
of success.
A Special Picnic To-morrow.
Great expectations are being aroused in
the family excursion and picnic to take
place to-morrow at Schuetzen Park un
der the auspices of the San Francisco
Hebrew Social Club. An invitation has

LATEST NEWS
OF THE
NATIONAL GAME,
BY JOE CORBETT.
The importance of unremitting practice,
while in most cases despised by the em
bryo player, has fortunately been real
ized by the more ambitious managers.
Accounts which are authentic state that
all the country teams may be seen day
after day laboring hard, and no doubt
conscientiously. That the managers of
these teams have seen the urgent neces
sity of practice is most gratifying, and
how encouraging it would be if Messrs.
Coffroth and Bunker should follow in the
footsteps of these gentlemen. In such an
event the games hereafter played at
Recreation Park and elsewhere would
necessarily be striked of their disgusting
yellowness, a tins*e that has been the
most conspicuous element witnessed dur
in~ play since the consolidation. It is
the Blncerest wish of all supporters of the
game that the playing, especially that of
the San Franciscos, be improved. In a
way their wishes havo not been disre
garded, for a decided improvement has
characterized the playing of all the
teams, but perfection in a baseball sense
has not been reaoheu and it is to that
end the ambitions ot managers and play
ers should bo directed. Tins perfection
which is the most essential factor per
taining to the linancial success of the
league, can be attained only through per-
Beverance on the part of the players tn
their preliminary work. However, it Is
not to be expected that a player volun
teers his spare moments to a work which
is monotonous and tiresome if his em
ployer cannot afford to assist him in his
tedious task by being present.
It is really astonishing to note that
Bunker ami Coffroth have not had their
team out for a single day's practice since
the league opened. Still these two have
more to say regarding the poor attend
ance than any other managers in the
league. That the crowds are increasing
certainly Is not to their credit or to the
work or their team, for this aggregation
In its every department has done more to
Injure the success of this new venture
than the entire league, umpires not omit
ted. What they should do now is, lirst.
agree on a plan whereby people will see
tit to place a little confidence in their abil
ity to properly manage a team, and sec
ondly, to follow out this plan in a com
plimentary manner.
As I mentioned, the country teams are
practicing every day. Manager Tuttle
and Swartan of Santa Cruz have issued
orders which necessitated a fine of $.'>
on any player failing to put in an ap
peararice for daily practice. Such meth
ods simply sparkle with success, and why
can't Coffroth and Bunker do likewise?
So long as they disagree with them
selves, of course, It is useless to try to
make a winning team out of the 'Friscos.
But if they would but take cognizance
of the fact that with a little attention,
combined with a slight display of inter
ested spirit, their team could come
near being made the best in the league.
Their praises would be sung the town
over.
Then, again, they would, by their
change of front, instill contidence Into
the hearts of the rooters, who haw
faith in the team on account of its being
improperly managed. On top of this
would follow the desired big crowds at
tending the games, and the continued
success of the new league would be as
sured.
Come on, ye Napoleon of typewriters
and sausage manipulatorsâ cast ..
those telephone and date books and pay
some little attention to the soubrettes of
your sphere. They feel and show the
loss of a guiding hand, and their pitiful
wail, "If we only h;ui a manager," has
become unbearable.
Then, I heard last night that if you did
not wake up, the team complete would
be taken away from you and turned over
to more competent hands. This, of
course, is confidential, and I should con
ski, r it an unparalleled instance of Span
iardism should you, even during your nu
merous nightmares, make known to Mr.
"Disproportioned" Raver the source of
your information. 1 am not Jesting, and
advance you the advice gratis, hop
ing, for the sake of baseball, that the
hint may be taken. I also was apprised
of the fact that Bunker bought himself
a drink yesterday. This shows a disposi
tion to loosen up, and I trust it will not
discontinue.
Carl Blitzenschutz, 163 Santa Clara
street: "I have heard bo many coniiicr
lng stories regarding the play you inquire
about that I experience great difficulty
in forming an opinion. From your de
ecription, however, 1 would vouch for the
statement that the runner was safe at
first, and the man on third was entitled
to score. The play in question I have
never seen, yet think you will find my
ruling correct."
The Fresno team is now controlled by
one manager. There have been too many
bosses to produce effective results. The
same holds good of the Friscos.
S. N. & Co., Third and Brannan streetsâ
The distance from tirst base to second is
ninety feet. The distance from the
home plate to second Is 120 feet, twice tho
distance from the pitcher's box to either
the home plate or second.
Youngus Johnson, who was released by
the Rochester ciub for lack of condition.
Is having great trouble in his endeavors
to secure a position on some of the other
league teams. Poor Youngua will come
to when it is too late.
Held; whose batting drove In many a
run for the Fresnos, seems to be losing
control of that optic.
A lesson in team work is being given the
Fresnos. Individually the nine is food,
but timely battery and team work have
yet to be understood.
In giving the' standing of the clubs a.
week ago a very serious and unfomir.ate
mistake, whereby the Sand < â 
.â¢n><i to no little extent, was made, and
which I take great pleasure in correcting.
Instead of being in last place they .
fixth in the race, with a percentage of 400,
having lost six and won four games.
WORDS OP ADVICE
TO LOCAL ANGLERS
The following words of good advice to
anglers aro from the pen of A. V. La
Motte, who Is superintending the fish
hatchery at TJklah. True sportsmen will
appreciate the article in question, which
reads:
To the ' Sporting: Editor of ThÂ« Callâ Dear \
Sir: It .Ja a general complaint among tin
fishermen of the State that the trout In the
streams pet smaller with each succeeding year.
Now, this Is not altogether correct. The de
mand made on -our streams increases year 'by
year as the 'number of fishermen Increase, and
It is not every- one /who goes fishing who ' Is â¢ a
true disciple of Isaac Walton, or lives up to
the ethics of true sportsmanship. A "fisher
man" will 'not stand- on a riffle and' whip out
flngerllngs, but will go on from pool to pool
and rapid to rapid until he tlnds fish large"
enough to afford sport, | and spare the Imma
ture troutleta until they' grow large enough to
catch. It is a poor excuse to say: "Well, I
cannot find. large fish, so I take small ones."
Why does -he not -follow up such . reasoning
until he says: "I cannot find fish, so 1 â  take
the eggs.". If . they â do not give -. the . trout a ;
chance to grow, how will they ever get large? i
Such people should be called "scavengers" 'of
the streams, not fishermen. .â. â ; , -
The only way to improve the present-condi
tions apparent to the writer seems to lie In the
judicious stocking of the streams with early
spawning fish. It is a known fact that fish ;
spawn earlier in some parts of the State than' i
in others.. For example, the steelhead com
mences spawning In Eel Klver, Mendoclno
County, frequently in December and January, i
Now, these eggs, if hatched In February ; and
March, will attain twelve months' growth be
fore the open season for fishing commences,
hence will by that time have attained a growth
of eight or nine inches, amply large to afford :
sport in catching. Whereas, the eggs taken
from late spawning localities have a shorter !
length of time fnr development and are not ;
large enough to catch by April 1 following. it
la for this reason that the management of the ,
Ban Francisco and North Pacific Railway Com- i
pany constructed, during the last season, a
spawning ; station on one of the tributaries of
Eel River for the purpose of furnishing their
Ukiah hatchery with early fry. The experi
ment has proved a success, as the fry now in
the hatchery are amply large enough for dis
tribution in the streams, and 'â  will furnish fine
sport by next April. Respectfully,
A. â  V.. LA MOTTB.
Mr.. McDonald of Boca writes The Call
that trout fishing on the beautiful Truc
kee could not bo better than it Is at- the
present time, and that largo baskets of
fish are brought Into town daily by the
tourists who are enjoying happy days In
the Sierra Nevadas. The Tuekeo is very
low this year, and the outlook for first
class ; sport from now until late in the j
season was never better. .;â ;â¢;

ANNUAL MEET ON
JULY 4
AT SACRAMENTO
Entries for the big State meet at Sacra
mento on July 2-4 closo Monday next with
the Capital City Wheelmen at Sacramen
to. Interest in cycle racing has been re
vived by the near approach of the meet,
and there will likely be a large attend
ance from this and surrounding cities.
It seems probable now that Frank G.
Peck will not ride the proposed match
with J. E. Wing at the Sacramento meet.
Peck thinks he can do better in the open
events, and as the purse for the match
is only $35 and Wing has an organized
corps of pacemakers, while Peck has
none, the latter does not like the game.
He str tes, however, that he is willing to
race Yv'ing unpaced. or single or tandem
paced, but declines to meet him on unlim
ited pacing grounds for the reason that
he (Peck) cannot get a team of pacemak
ers trained and ready in the short time
intervening before the meet.
The semi-annual election of officers of
the Pacific Cycling Club was held last

The club's baseball team will go up to

bership may be had from the cycling ed
itor of The Call. The roadbook is free to

TRAP SHOOTING AT
DIFFERENT POINTS
The Olympic Gun Club will meet at the
Tngleside. trap grounds to-morrow and
will smash blue rocks. The South Ends
will enjoy the afternoon with the, clays
at Colma, and the Alerts will burn powder
and scatter shot at Birds Point. The Cal- j
ifornia Wing Club will meet in a live bird
shoot at Ingleside July 3.
Otto Feudner, the crack pigeon shot,
was . very much incensed last Sunday
when, after a journey to Suisun, he was \
debarred by the Suisun Gun Club from j
competing in the live bird shoot. It is \
safe to say that if Feudner had taken part I
he would feu \>- carried away all the
money, as there was not a clean score

McCAUSLAND AND
PAPE WILL
RACE IN SKIFFS.
The oarsmen of San Francisco and Ala-
meda have two topics of discussion at
the present timeâthe shell and skiff races
to take place at El Campo to-morrow,
and the Fourth of July regatta. Of these
two topics by far the more interesting
is the El Campo event. There will be
six races to-morrow, but of these two
will be preliminary heats, leaving foui
conclusive contests on the programme,
The list of entries in the junior and senior
outrigged skiff races has already been
published in The Call; if is large and
representative enough to make It certain
that all who care for oarsmanship will
see an excellent day's sport. The seven
contestants in the junior outrigged skiff
race will row in two preliminary heats,
four in the first and three in the sec-
ond heat. All the clubs except the Tritons
ana Olympics are represented. The Flo-
Deer and Alameda clubs have two en-
tries each, and the Dolphins, South Ends
and Arieis one each. The Alameda men.
W. Hunsen and J. Lewis, are both in
flue condition, and are pulling better than
ever they did. Their skiffs are' not so
light as those that will be used by some
of their competitors, but Leander Steven-
son is putting them into thorough order,
and Lewis and Hansen are expected to
render a very good account of themselves,
In rough water Lewis should have a de-
cided advantage, as he has been accus-
tomed to it all his life. The two pre-
lirninary heats in the junior outrigged
.skiff race will be rowed in the morning.
the first soon after 11 o'clock and the
really important event of the day, the
special match race between Alex Pape of
the Dolphins and William McCausland of
the Ariels. will start about 1 p. m. Pape
has been training faithfully and practic-
ing regularly, and will prove a dangerous
antagonist, but McCausland's greater ex-
perience nay enable him to keep his
championship honors. The senior shell
race between H. Wittkopf of the Ariels
and J. Lynn of Stockton is next on the
programme, and is to be followed by tha
final heat in the junior outrigged skiti
race. The last event is |the senior out-
rigged skiff race, in which the winner
of the Pape-McCausland match race will
probably row, and should make things
interesting for the other competitors. \V.
O. Patch of the Dolphins has been train-
ing .tssiduously and has much improved
his stroke nnd paco. The Alameda Boat
Club has two entries, F. Avers and Chen-
ter Avers, and entertains great hopes that
F. Ayors will prove the winner.
The South End Boat Club, which last
year distinguished itself so much at El
Campo, has only one representative in
to-morrow's racesâ J. Lyons, who Is
drawn in the first heat of the junior out
rigged skiffs. But the South Ends will,
doubtless, send in some strong barge
crews for the four-oared events to be
rowed at El Campo on July 17. The Pio
neers are represented by H. Wilder and
Coney Ochs, the hitter of whom will use
J. T. Sullivan's n"\v boat bnilt by Twigg.
The Alameda Boat Club is growing in
strength and numbers. At its last meet
ing two now members â Charles Hague and
George Conradâ were fleeted; five appli
cations for membership will be passed on
next Tuesday, and three more are on the
board. The club has displayed its patriot
ism by naming its skiffs Dewoy and Hob-
Bon, and two yawls Schley and Sampson,

SCHISM IN
THE
TENNIS RANKS.
The last weeks of June are busy ones
for the tennis players. The championship
tournament, commencing in the first dayti
of July, is attracting the attention of all
racquet wielders who aspire for tennis
honors, and the various club courts are
alive with practicing players. The mud
dle has not yet been cleared despite the
juvenile asseverations of some of the ultra,
enthusiasts among the third class play
ers. According to the calls for entries
there are two Pacific States Lawn Tennis
Associations. Each belligerent claims that
it is the only bona flde organization. On
the bulletin board of the California Ten
nis Club is posted a circular calling for
entries to the Coast Association, ana
right above it Is another of the same kind
but with totally different officers. The
association which seems to have the best
of it is the one in which the Hardys will
play, and of which Sam Hardy is the
secretary and treasurer. This organiza
tion will hold the tournament on the Sari
Rafael courts, as is the custom estab
lished by precedent. Robert X. Whit
ney, who has arranged for the other tour
nament, intends to hold the championship
tournament on the California Club courts,
but it is doubtful whether the entry list
of this tournament will be very large, oÂ»
whether the California Club will permit
it In oppositlo.n to the San Rafael tour
nament. The tournament committee of:
the old association consists of the follow
ing: George Whitney Ed Woodbury ana
Robert N. Whitney. George S. Bradshaw
has been selected as referee. That there
is a schism no one with the powers of
observation will deny.
Whatever the outcome is the Pacific
Lawn Tennis Association will suffer. In
place of a contingent of first-class play
ers the California Club will send a much
Inferior lot of men to contest in the cham
pionship tournament, which will begin on
July 1. The Whitneys will not be en
tered, and George Bradshaw, who is a
member of the old party, will undoubted
ly refuse to play. The only ones lent
in the tournament among the iirst-class
men are the Hardys, and it will b* the
most veritable kind of a cinch for them
to win without an effort. There will be
quite a large entry list in the San Rafael
tournament among the second-class men.
It is very probable that the other tour
nament will not eventuate, leaving the
San Rafael players the entire field. "
Arrangements for this tournament have
been perfected. Tne courts of the Hotel
Rafael have been improved and every
thing will be put in readiness for the
championship events. Play will begin
on Friday, July 1, at 10 a. m., continu-
Ing on the 2d ana the 4th. Valuable
prizes will be given for first and second
places in the tournament. Tne winner
Will be called upon to play George Whit
ney for the championship of the coast,
though it is extremely doubtful if Whit
ney will respond to the call. The .-v> rules
of the United States Lawn Tennis Asso
ciation will be followed, the regulation
Wright & Ditson ball being used. All
matches will be three out of live sets.
The entrance fee will be $1. The entries
close June 29, IS9-S, and must be seÂ»t With
fe*> to Sam P. Hardy, %1 Broadway, Oak
land.
On Monday morning, July 4, there will
be held an open consolation doubles tour
nament for the benefit of those defeated
in the first round. Special trains will
leave San Rafael at fi:33 p. m. on Satur
day, July 2, and on Monday, July 4.
The entries for the Son Rafaol tourna
ment are: From the Oakland Clubâ Sam
P Hardy, Sumner Hardy. Ed Spencer, R.
Nicholson, O. C. Pratt. Paul Selby. Ala
meda Clvb â Percy Murdock. Allen Bow
en and Bob Holmes, California Clubâ
Drummond McGavin, Jack O'Brien,
George Broemmel, Dick Adams and R. W.
Weihe.
There is also a spirit of unrest in the
San Rafaol tournament party concerning
the cup which George Whitney won last
year. The law reads that the holder must
win three successive years before It be
comes his absolute property. If Whitney
f;ii!s to recognize tho legitimacy of the

SNATCHED FROM THE ARMY.
Edgar Liebes Released From the
Third Artillery on a Writ of
Habeas Corpus.
Mrs. Hannnh Liebes, widow of thÂ« late
Hermann Llebes, the furrier, procured a
writ of habeas corpus yesterday for the
recovery of her son, Edgar A. Liebes,
who enlisted three days ago In Battery
H, Third Regiment, U. S. Artillery, sta
tioned at the Presidio.
Oaptaln James O'Hara of the battery
produced yo'ing Liebes in United States
District Judtfe de Haven's court yester
day afternoon. The case was heard there.
Mrs. LtebeS testified that her son was
20 years "and three months old, that she
was his logal guardian as well as his
mother, and that he had enlisted in de
fiance of her refusal to give him permis
sion.
Young Liebes exhibited considerable
hesitancy when asked to state his age,
and it was only when it was dragged out
of him by the counsel that he admitted
that his mother had testified truly.
Judge de Haven ordered the boy dis
charged from military custody and
restored to the arms of" his mother. Cap
tain O'Hara said after the adjournment
of court that the boy would probably be
dishonorably discharged for having en
listed fraudulently.
Demand for War Bonds.
Cashier E. A. O'Connor of the Post

War as an Investment,
By Russell Sage,
In next Sunday's Call,
COIN IN CHUNKS
FOR THE
COURSING DOGS.
Much money has been hung up and
many dogs are looking for It at the two
coursing parks to-day. Occasionally there
is heard a pessimistic whisper that the
leashmen are playing the sport for "all
that the traffic will bear." If they are
the evidence is sadly lacking. The crowds
increase weekly. The prizes continue to
show an upward tendency. More dogs are
forthcoming at every drawing than can
be accommodated, and the class of the
stock is ever growing better.
Sullivan and Curtis & Sons are certainly
rivals at Union Park to-day, coming
against each other no less than three
times in the run down. The competing
dogs are all of tried quality.
Arthur Massey will have another pair
of Eastern long tails at Ingleside next
week. During his four weeks on the
coast Massey has lightened the Ingleside
cash box of second money once, third
money twice, fourth money twice and
fifth money twice, besides which he has
crossed the line twiceâ a totai of $220.
Right Bower is making his first run at
Union Park to-day. He was purchased
by E. V. Sullivan a few days ago, to
gether with two puppies. Mr. Sullivan
has also purchased Sunburst from Dillon
& Reilly.
Skyball and Rosette should put up a
hot run at Union Park to-day. The talent
Will doubtless follow Rosettej but old
Skyball has many a run left in him yet.
Picking the final winner at Union Park
to-day appears to be a harder task than
for several weeks. Curtis, Sullivan and
Rosseter all look to have a mortgage on
it, and there are dark horses galore. The
probable winners are:
All age stakeâ Magnet, Koolawn, Thorn
hill, Hercules, Douglass, Rusty Gold, Do
Me, Van Kirk, Lady Blanche, Alameda,
False Flatterer, Myrtle, Theron, Tessie
Fair, Bendalong, Terrona, Metallic, Lady

Puppy stake â Magnesia, Minerva, Billy
Gladstone, Miss Skyrocket, Bull Hill,
Morning Glory, Obediah, Daisy Dean,
Brutus, Royal Prize, Sunburst, Heather
Dell, Flyaway, Jersey Lily, Liberty Bell,
Rich and Artless.
The crowd that witnessed the coursing
at Union Park last Saturday was the
largest and most enthusiastic of the sea
son. With the growing attendance it is
safe to say that the park managers will
be compelled to increase the compart
ment which Is within easy reach of the
pools. Thousands of dollars passed into
the boxes on Sunday and as the dogs run-
ning to-day are well matched the betting
promises to be even more spirited than
usual. Union Park is unquestionably cut
ting quite a dash. Its leap to the front
in quick order is astonishing.
J. R. Smith's great Eastern bitch Ida is
expected here shortly. She is considered
the only "flyer" in America that stands
a chance of lowering the colors of For
Freedom.
On July 17 a Veteran stake will be run
at Union Park. The dogs likely to be
entered are Tern Hayes, Magpie, Sky
rocKet, Waratah, Belmont, Electric and

The Interstate Coursing Club has finally
decided to hold its annual meeting at

RIFLE BULLETS
THAT WILL
TEAR THE FLESH.
Within the past month or so there has
been considerable said about the Mauser
rifle, used by the Spaniards in Cuba and
Manila. Strange as it may seem, there
are very few riflemen here who have a
distinct idea of this firearm and the cart
ridge it uses. Recent reports from a sur
geon who examined the bodies of the
marines killed at the first engage
ment with the Spaniards at Camp Mc-
Calla were that the bodies were not mu
tilated, as first stated, but that the
ghastly wounds had been made by Mau
ser bullets. This made people wonder
â what kind of deadly missiles the Span
iards shoot in their rifles. It is very
likely that they are shooting deadly mis
siles, not recognized as legitimate by civ
ilized nations. The Mauser rifle is not
very dissimilar to the rifle adopted by the
United States, the Krag-Jorgensen. It is
made in Germany and is constructed of
three tubes instead of a solid barrel, like
most such pieces. It has a bolt action
and a magazine similar to that of the
new United States musket, the cartridges,
five in number, being carried in small
metal boxes like the Lee.
The bullet used is a trifle over a .33 cal
iber, or 3-100 of an inch larger than that
of the Krag-Jorgensen, and those adopt
ed for army use are known as the steel
jacketâ in other words, a steel shell con
taining pure lead to give weight. These
bullets have great penetrating powers,
but they do not necessarily tear the flesh.
The only explanation as to how the bul
lets shot by the Spanish soldiers mutilat
ed the bodies of the marines so badly is
that they shot the soft point or "soft
nose." hunting bullet. This style of mis
sile is intended only for hunting big game.
It is of half steel jacket and the point is
of pure lead.
When the point strikes an object it
mushrooms like a toadstool, find while
the hole at the entrance is not large, the
place where such a bullet cones out is
invariably very large and ragged. Such
cartridges are intended only f>>r big and
dangerous game. They have been found
to be too tearing for game killed for con
sumption and lighter cartridges with
smaller soft points have come into more
general use. If the marines were mutil
ated with Mauser bullets those missiles
must have been of the kind used for
slaughtering bears and lions.
The local interest in rifle shooting has
not abated in the least because of the
war taking so many of the younger men
into the ranks. To-morrow half a dozen
rifle clubs will hold forth at the Shell
Mound range and some good scores may
be expected M. J. WHITE.

TO WATCH THE FOBESTS.
The drought that California has exper
ienced this year will necessitate a care
ful watching of the big forest districts.
As a consequence a flro ban I has been or
ganized in the McOloud Valley, which is
especially wealthy in large and valuable
timber.
The valley Is about twenty miles long,
with a scattering of lumber camps and
stations. A mounted patrolman will make
a journey back and forth every day on
the watch for fires. He will have 300 men
at his call, all of whom have signified
their willingness to respond at once in
time of danger. During the month of
July but one mounted patrolman will be
employed. In August and September an
other will be added to the force.
A Point on Recording.
The Supreme Court has decided a point
In law relative to the filing of documents
for record. G. Grand executed a mort
gage to one Edwards. His wife on tne
same day executed a declaration to home
stead a portion of the same property.
Edwards gave the mortgage to one of the
deputies in the Recorder's office a little
after office hoursâ s o'clockâ with direc
tions to record as soon as the office
opened in the morning. Mrs. Grand gave
the declaration of homestead to one of
the deputies a few minutes before the
office opened on the following morning,
with directions to record at once. Both
documents were marked as filed at 9
o'clock. Edwards sued on the mortgage
and obtained judgment. Mrs. Grand con
tested, and the point raised was that her
document was really the first filed. The
decision that the mortgage was the first
executed was affirmed by the higher
court, which also held that although both
were recorded at the same time the mort
gage was filed first, having been placed
in the hands of a deputy for record on
the preceding day The matter of office
hours cuts no figure In such cases.
Sailors and Their Grievances.
The grievances of sailors examined by the
authorities In ports of entry, where the sea
men belong, often turn out to be imaginary or
greatly exaggerated. But there are plenty of
cruel and conscienceless skippers who abuse
their crews. Violence is always objectionable
and pointedly so when It Is exerted upon an
unfortunate liver, stomach or bowels by dos
ing with drastic purgatives which weaken the
Intestine*. Use HoÃtetter"s Stomach Bitter*.
SAN FRANCISCOS
HOLD JINKS
AND A REGATTA.
This evening the San Francisco Yacht
Club will give a jinks at the clubhouse,
to which all yachtsmen are cordially In

gatta over a course in front of the club
house. Several entries have been re
ceived, and the course will be pointed out
to yachtsmen on the day of the race.
Yachts will be divided by "mean length"
into tin.- iollowing four classed Class 1,
yachts of 37 feet and not more than 44
feet; class 2, yachts of 30 feet and not
more than 37 feet; class 3, yachts of 25
feet and not more than 30 feet; class 4,
yachts of 20 feet and not more than 25

startâ class 1 at 1 p. m., class 2 at 1:1*
P. m., class 3 at l:2o p. m. and class 4 at
1:30 p. m. There will be no time allow
anoes, and the first boat to cross the fin
ishing line will win rirst prize in her
class. Second prizes will not be awarded
unless at least three boats compete. If
enough entries are received there will be
a special race for yachts of less than 20
feet mean length.
The Pacific Yacht v.iub has a cruise to
Paradise Cove for to-day, and one to the
Heads for to-morrow. On Friday, July
1, the Pacific yachts will anchor off
Meiggs wharf, and at 4:30 a. m on Sat
urday July 2, a preparatory gun will be
nred from Commodore E. A. \V iltsee'3
flagship Aggie; at 5 a. m. a second gun
will signal the yachts to start for Santa
Cruz. Notices have been sent to the va
rious yacht owners, and it is hoped that
tne following yachts will join the cruise:
Admiral J. D. Spreckels' schooner Lur
line. Vice Commodore Martin Roberts'
schooner Azalene, ex-Commodore p Ca
duc's sloop Annie, \V. S. Lrooufellow'g
schooner La Paloma, E. W. Hopkins'
steam yacht El Primero and the schooner
Lady Mine, In command of Alexander
Swanson.
The Corinthian cruise to McXearte land
ing last Saturday and Sunday was well
attended and very successful.
Fred R. Cook's sloop Harpoon is to be
raffled off in August. Tickets, of which
there will be 400 at $5 each, may be ob
tained from Commodore Dr. T. L. Hill of
the San Franciscos.
Vice Commodore Andrew Thome of the
Corinthians will put the yawl Seven 1 tolls
in commission and will join in the inter
club cruise on July 3 and 4.
Secretary G. F. Gafthers slooo" U & I
was the only yacht flying the burgee of
the Californias at McNr.ir-s last Sunday,
for Vice Commodore G. B. Edgar's sloop
Sappho flew the San Francisco flag, and
E. F. Sag^r's sloop Edna the Corinthian,
H. W. Brydges' yawl Hope started on the
cruise, but did not reach McXears. On
the return home she took in tow a white
hall, having on board several members of
the Oakland Canoe Club.
Last Saturday Fawn of the Encinals,
with E. Ynungberg, R. Mitchell and C.
Darneal, went on a three days* cruise In
the upper bay. To-day Sphinx, with Tar
pey, O'Connor and Allen Ward, starts on
an up-river cruise. \Y. Bates' Vixen Is
up the river, and Spray has gone back to
the Corinthian Club. Commodore J. S.
Hanley will probably charter another
yacht. Fawn will probably challenge for
the Perpetual Cup, at present held by
Aeolus of the Corinthians. A private
party was given at the Encinal Clubhouse
last Wednesday by the Misses Carpen
tier.
Martin Doerr, a San Jose jeweler, has
presented to the South Bay Yacht Club
a handsome silver cup, to be known as
the "Doerr prize," and raced for annu
ally. The first race for the cup will be
held on July 4, and the course will bÂ«
from the mouth of Steamboat Slough to
Dumbarton Point and return, a distance
of about fifteen miles. The following en
tries have been made: Port Captain W.
B. Ortley's scooner Dawn, Secretary J.
E. Auzerais' sloop Papoose, Commodore
Joseph O. McKee's sloop Wanderer, Vie*-
Commodore H. A. Spencer's sloop Rana.
the sloop Zephyr and Louis Sonniksen'3
sloop Feufollet. The last named was
formerly owned by H. H. Gorter of the
Corinthians, and is a keel boat having a
length over all of twenty-nine feet six
inches. The South Bay Club is increas
ing in membership, and has a fleet of
eleven boats. A large float is being built
at Alviso, which will render it much
easier than it has hitherto been to board
and disembark from the yachts.
To-day and to-morrow being open dates
for the Corinthian, JSnoinal and California*
clubs, many yachtsmen will be free to
attend the iinks and regatta of the San
Francisco Club.

HAS NO JUSTICE COUBT.
A Bad Blunder by Those Who Framed
Berkeley's New Charter.
The town of Berkeley is without a
Justice Court, says the Supreme Court In
a decision handed down yesterday in
the case of Miner against Jus
j tice W. H. H. Gentry and others. He
applied for a writ of mandate to compel
the Justice to issue an execution on a
i judgment alleged to have been recovered
In a case against A. M. Nixon. This in
volved the question as to whether tna
court of Berkeley was in" existence at the
time the plaintiff began action, July 20
1597, or subsequent thereto, as well a-* the
effect of the adoption of the freeholders'
charter upon the previous charter The
charter under which the town was incor
porated specified among the officers two
Justices of the Peace. The Supreme Court
holds that under the law the present
charter supersedes all other charter* and
Is the organic law. The contention of the
petitioners was thai as the freeholders'
charter did not create a court it could not
be considered as a destroying one. The
j court held, as in the Sparks case of Sac
i ramento, that the charter was supposed
I to be complete of itself and to provide all
that it desired. The old Justice Court was
created with the old charter, and it fell
with it. In this the majority of the Su
preme Justices concurred. Flarrison, Hen
! Shaw, Garoutte and Temple signing the
i denial of the petition. Van Fleet. Beatty
: ami McFarland dissented, the latter con
; tending that the part of the act incorpor
ating the town and creating the office of
j justice was not repealed by the freehold
ers' charter, which could not deal with
the judiciary. There is a possibility that
many complications may grow out of this
decision.

NEPHEW WOLF IS OUT
CHIEF LEES FORCED TO AC
KNOWLEDGE HIS MISTAKE.
President Tobin of the Board of Po
lice Commissioners Respon
sible for ths
Change.
Chief Leea evidently realizes his mistake
in trying to fool the Police Commissioners
into appointing his nephew. Sergeant
Wolf, captain of the City Prison.
Since "Handsome Willie" Robinson, who
was in charge of the prison, was forced
to resign, Lees has been doing all in his
power to influence the Commissioners to
make "Wolf his successor. After considi
able scheming the astute Chief of Police
succeeded in having bis nephew appointed
to the responsible position of acting cap
tain of the prison with the pay of s.<j.
geant.
Evidently anxious to provide him with
all the ''comforts of hom< ," Lees 01
the carpenter of the Police Departn*

stained glass front, so that his favored
relative would not be annoyed by the
"plebeian herd" that Infest the city bas
tile.
Just as "Rube," as he is familiarly
known, was enjoying life at the expense
of the city his uncle, the senile Chief of
Ived a note from Judge Tobin,
â lent of the Board of Police Commis
rs, In which he stated that under no
consid< ration would h<' submit to Wolf

prison to suit himself. As the result Cup

TROTTING MEETING
TO OPEN TO-DAY
THE EREEDERS' ASSOCIATION'S
NEW AND NOVEL CARD.
Bnvey Appointed Starter and Other
Track Gossip â Latest Entries and
Prospects of an Interest
ing Opening.
Not for many years past has the Pacific
Coast Trotting-Horse Breeders' Associa
tion had such good reason to congratulate
itself on the outlook for the success of its
summer meeting, which opens to-day at
the Oakland racetrack, as on the present
occasion. The weather could not be bet
ter; the splendid track of the California
Jockey Club is in such first-class condition
as only an oid trottlng-horse expert in
that special line of business like William
Fieldwick can make it, while the intro
duction of bookmakers, in addition to
poolsellers, together with the welcome and
novel change of dashes instead of the
fraud-provoking heat races, has created
an unusual Interest among the general
public outside the regular attendants at
harness meetings.
The appointment of that most im
portant official, the starter, was made
during' the week, and the board of direct
ors is to* be congratulated on Its selection
of Dick Havey for that post. Though of
late years Dick has Identified himself
rather more with the thoroughbred, he
has had considerable experience as a
trainer and driver of trotters, and has
frequently officiated as starter with uni
formly good success. Certain it is that
lie will find little difficulty in obtaining the
necessary obedience to his orders from
his .former companions-in-reins.
The resignation of E. P. Heald from the
presidency of the association, which took
place quite recently, leaves that office
temporarily vacant, the duties devolving
on vice-Presidents D. E. Knight and A.
G. Gurnett. The judge's stand will be oc
cupied by members of the board of direct
ors, and the secretary. F. Kelly, and
Director A. S. Cohen will attend to the
details pertaining to the office of clerk of
the course.
Park Henshaw, colonel of the new Cali
fornia regiment now being mustered for
active military duty, has quite a few
horses in Jim Sullivan's hands. At the
present writing It looks as If his camp will
be at no great distance from the track,
and his enthusiasm for the trotting game
need not be dampened by an enforced ah*
sence from the scene of speed contests. .
There are likely to be plenty of private
matches arranged to take place during
this meeting, the rivalry in possession of
fast horses being especially keen among
members of the Golden Gate Park Driv
ing Association, four of whom put up $25
each the other evening toward a purse to

TRYING TO
REINSTATE
Does the City Own St.
Marys Street?
PROPERTY OWNERS SAY NO
THE PURPOSE OF THE ALCALDE
MARKET COMPANY.
Will Attempt to Gain the Entire
Thoroughfare on the Ground
of a Failure to
Record.
The Alcalde Market Company, the cor
poration which claims the rightful own
ership of St. Marys street, has clothed
itself In a pall of mystery, and seems
determined that future plans shall be
kept as far as possible from the public.
The object of the purchase of the prop
erty on a qu^claim deed from Theodore
Payne, although supposed to be a mat
ter of conjecture, will be undoubtedly
considered an attempt of the concentra
tion of the efforts of those forming the
corporation to declare the street private
property and reopen the adjoining houses
to tenants of the same character as those
who a few months ago were compelled
to vacate under penalty of the law.
If this contemplated object can be real
ized gates can be erected on both ends
of the street and the houses reopened,
but even this precaution for the preserv
ation of public morals can be dispensed
with at the option of the declared owners
of the street, who, falling to see the ne
cessity, can refuse to erect them. This
will absolutely nullify whatever control
or jurisdiction the Board of Supervisors
may have exercised in the past, as with
private property, property-owners can do
as they please as long as they conform I
to the police regulations and the laws
governing the city.
Although the Alcalde Company will en
deavor to prove that the street was ,
never properly and legally claimed and
recorded by the city, the fact remains i
that for the past forty years or more
the street has been used as a public thor- j
oughfare, patrolled by public officers and
governed by municipal laws.
Theodore Payne, from whom the Quit
claim deed to the property was secured
by the corporation, is represented as the
original owner of the entire property sit
uated on both sides of the street, includ
ing the street itself.
For convenience, a dividing line was
cut through the land and houses erected
on either side, the dividing line becoming
afterward known as St. narys street.
This however, in one of the recorded
deeds of the past is absolutely denied, a?
In it Payne acknowledges St. JUar> s
Street as a public thoroughfare. \\ hat
ever property he sold was measured and
apportioned from and in conformity with,
the street line, which he never claimed
as private property, understanding no
doubt that the street was public property
and as such land owners were at liberty
to avail themselves of the free use of it.
In no title or deed of property does he
mention the sale as including that por
tion of the street directly in tront of the
Pr iÂ°f P lt t> is S Â°possiWe to declare the street
private property the intention of the Al
caide Company is manifest. I.'pon the
deed of award the street will be closed,
gates erected and negotiations made with
the property owners by the corporation
for the sale of the thoroughfare at an
exorbitant price, which, they failing to
accept, the former can erect an obstruc
tion on the street and utterly ruin the
adjoining property until such time as ttoÂ»
property owners are forced into accepting
the street at whatever price is de
manded.
The leading members of the corporation
are J. L. White, Martin Kelly and Attor
ney Mnrgenstern. Shares have been free
ly bought in the company by those hold
ing property in the northern section of
the alley, those in the southern section
refusing to purchase on the ground that
they are battling in a lost cause, as no
court would recognize private claims for
the possession of the street.
Martin Kelly, who seems to be the lead
ing spirit in the new movement, was the
legal adviser of the property owners, who
engaged him immediately after the street
was closed some months ago, to exert his
inlluence and expend an enormous sub
scribed sum for the purpose of nullifying
the action of the courts. The money
was accepted the work never accom
plished. Kelly claimed that he used it
legitimately and for the purpose out
lined, but the property owners claim that
he used the money elsewhere than in the
direction needed and avow that the pres
ent action is being made to dispute the
validity of the law for the purpose of
making some compensation for the money
received and lost.
It is for this reason that those holding
claims in the Pine street end of the street
have refused to co-operate, as they firmly
believe that it is a public thoroughfare,
and that the new corporation cannot pos
sibly accomplish the object in view.
J. L. White, in outlining and defining
the object of the institution of the cor
poration, spoke of its origin as a com
bined effort of those interested in it to
prove that the street is private and not
public property and to force the city in
consequence to accept whatever disposal
they may see fit to make of it.
"If this street, "said White, "can be pro
ven private property, as it undoubtedly
can.we can take whatever precautions we
may see proper to protect the public
morals of the city and rent the houses to
those unfortunate women who, as a con
sequence of not being concentrated in
one section of the city, are scattered
loosely in the various cheap lodging
houses on tho public thoroughfares and
menace the public purity far more than
if they were allowed to lead the shameful
life they have accepted in a private street,
where the police are constantly on watch
for the prevention of crime and where the
women are constantly under the eye of
4\, i , In -nr
"It is far better to have them here than
to run the risk of having them next door
to the homes of respectable people. I
think that if it is possible to reopen the
street in conformity with law it should
"St Marys street, unlike that of
Quincy. is away from the main streets of
the city, and is not a constant source of
annoyance to people who attend the
church at tho corner of California and
Dupont streets. It is so narrow as to be
hardly percentible. and the erection of
gates at both" ends would be a safeguard
against public immorality and a solution
of whatever objection the public might
have to its existence."
Although a strenuous effort Js being
made by the new corporation to open the
street, like action is being taken by those
who were instrumental in closing It, to
have it remain so.
Proceedings of the company to prose
cute its suit for the possession of the
street are expected to be Instituted in the
near future i _

THE ROUND TOWER AT KELLS
To Be Reproduced for the Coming Irish Fair.
Active preparations are in progress for the coming Irish fair and,
â when completed, the Interior of the Pavilion, as far as imitative art is pos
sible. Will illustrate the ancient beauty of the historical land of Erin and
the customs and various characteristics of its people.
One of the leading and most attractive features of the fete will be the
reproduction of the celebrated Round Tower at Kells, near Dublin, out
lined in the sketch above. This tower, which will be reproduced as true to
the original as possible, is now being constructed, and will be in position
in the Pavilion about August 20.
To those who are acquainted with the beauty of Irish scenery will cling
many fond recollections of the old ruins that once constituted the for
midable and majestic tower of Kells.
It is expected that the scenic effects of this fair will be most attrac
tive and well worth the price of admission alone. In addition to those
named above the artists are painting many scenes, such as "The Rocky
Road to Dublin" and "The Lower Lake of Killarney." There will be more
paintings of landscapes, castles, structures and marine views shown than
was ever seen in the Pavilion before. The Blarney Castle, Tara Hall and
Bank of Ireland booths and the map of Ireland in the hallway will be attrac
tive to all comers, whether of Celtic origin or not.
The honorary advisory board will meet this coming week at the Occi
dental Hotel parlors and will organize as a committee. The designs for the
badges will then be selected and reception committees will be appointed.
The list of members in full Is as follows: Governor James H. Budd, May
or James D. Phelan, Chief Justice W. H. Beatty, President of Board of Ed
ucation C. L. Barrington, M. H. de Young, Hon. Niles Searls, Hon. Tlrey

DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION.
An Interesting Discussion by Rev.
Joseph Riordan at St.
Ignatius.
"Evolution" was the subject of an able
discussion by Rev. Joseph \V. Riordan of
Santa Clara College at St. Ignatius Hall
last evening. The lecture was a learned
expose of the theory of evolution, which
regards man as the result of gradual de
velopment of the lower orders of life. A
distinct parallel was drawn between evo
lution and the truths outlined in the
Bible, ridiculing the idea that man was
created in a degenerate form to work out
and perfect his being by a succession of
changes and migrations from the skin
of the lower to that of an animal of
higher degree, finally evolving to the per
fect state in which he now exists.
The lecture, which was under the aus
pices of Council 129 of the Young Men's
Institute, was accompanied by literary
and musical exercises.

The advertisement canvasser for a St. Louis daily paper says of
Ripans Tabules : " Ever since I can remember I have been troubled
with constipation in its severest form. So acute, in fact, at times, as
to produce dreadful headaches that, notwithstanding all the outdoor
work afforded me by ray vocation, and the latitude it allowed me to
test my pedestrian abilities â which is supposed to be a successful
manner of displacing constipation â I was very often compelled to
forego my pursuit of 'business.' Constipation with me seemed to 1
be hereditary rather thaa due to accidental causes, therefore much
harder to relieve. In my extremity I often resorted to most drastio
measures, but found no cure to be permanent. In 1892, while con-
nected with the Times of El Paso, Tex., Ripans Tabules were brought
to my notice, and I used them with marked success. Nowadays I
never suffer from 6uch severe cases of constipation, and the violent
headaches I formerly experienced never worry me in the least. Some-,
times, though, when I allow myself to lapse for a period into irreg- !
ular habits, I become slightly constipated, but by takipg the Tabulet
according to directions, my bowels again perform their function* ia a

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 24.â The stock market was
Irregular most of the day, the result of the
trading showing gains of slight fractions in.
ttv*t issues, but with several advances of a
point or more In securities which occupied a
conspicuous position In the day's trading, no
tably Tobacco, Brooklyn Rapid Transit and the
Northern Pacific shares. There was some cov
ering of shorts early and a little more outside
â buying on the assurance given in Washington
regarding Germany's attitude in the Philip-
pines.
There was some anticipation that Santiago
might capitulate In time for the market to be
supported by the heavy July disbursements.
Humors of an early settlement or' the trans
continental war were again responsible for the
â strength in Northern Pacific, which was
moderately supplied by London. The absorp
tion recently by a syndicate of Baltimore and
Ohio holding? of western Union, which re
moved the fear of these large holdings being |
thrown on the market, was used as a lever in '
raising that stock, but there was realizing
on the advance, causing the stock to sag off.
The decrease In St. Paul's weekly earnings,
the first since October, accounted for the
sluggishness in ths Grangers. A movement
against the shorts in Tobacco brought about a
. sharp advance In that specialty.
â¢ Bonds displayed little feature to-day, but ex
hibited a very firm undertone, although there
was marked activity in some lines which have
recently posed as leaders. Sales were 12 -
450,000. , - â 
Bid quotations In Government bonds were un
changed, aside from a rise of V* in the new 4s.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 293,900

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, June 24.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Early In the pres
: ent week the speculation degenerated Into a dull
professional affair. Prices sagged off without
much animation being shown and later on ral
lied under manipulation directed against the
short Interest, which had apparently attained
considerable proportions. At the close of the j
week a stronger tone appeared In the favorable j
crop advices from the West and a belief that
the occupation of Santiago would lead ,to an
early peace. There was a lack of public par
ticipation throughout and the market became
professional in quality, while Europe has
hardly been an appreciable factor. The dull
ness and sagging tendency are ascribed to a
number of influences. The concentration of at
tention upon the Government bond issue has
been one of the chief of them, though the suc
cess of the popular subscription and the ab
sence of any disturbance in the money market i
from that cause tend to deprive it of further
force. It may. indeed, be noted that the mar
ket for railroad bonds has been exceptionally
strong and that good demand for investments
has asserted itself, extending from the high I
grade bonds to Issues of a secondary grade.
The market, however, could hardly fall to i
be chilled, temporarily at least, by the ap- !
proaching Influence of the stamp duties of the
war revenue bill, which affects Stock Ex
change dealings, loans of money and transac
tions in foreign exchange with more or less
severity. In fact, as regards the stock market, i
there is some trepidation shown as to whether
or not the institution of a tax of $2 per 100 |
chares will not tend to reduce public interest. j
The Exchange has, it is true. taken the matter j
boldly, and resolved that the customer, and
not the broker, shall be charged with the tax, j
and it remains to be seen whether the addi- |
tional cost to speculative transactions will be j
disregarded or not. It would seem that specu
lative Interests have been somewhat discour
aged by the declines In the price of grain and
the conflicting accounts of the crop results and !
prospects. The bull movement of prices dur- J
ing the past year has had for its foundation I
the high prices at which American breadstuffs
sold and the heavy foreign demand for them.
Consequently the drop in prices and . the per
sistent stories of damage to the crops have \
had more or less effect, particularly as they ;
are accompanied by indications that Western j
railroad earnings will not compare favorably I
with those of the last few months, when the j
exceptionally heavy grain movement was In |
progress. In fact, it Is claimed that this was
the cause for the stoppage of bullish support j
and manipulation in some of the prominent I
railroad stocks and the hesitating tone the
market assumed as soon as doubts as to the
crop began to appear. The rally later on was.
Indeed, based on the apparent fallacy of the
crop damage stories.
LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 24.â Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says:
The stock markets hÂ«*re continue quiet, the
only feature to-day being a sharp rise in Span
ish 4's and a heavy fall In Grand Trunks, the
latter due to the poor traffic report. Amer
icans were featureless. Baltimore and Ohio
common stock was sold heavily, but closed
above the worst.
The rise in Spanish 4's to-day was due to
bears covering on the advertisement by the
Spanish Government of a decree which com
pels the stamping of bonds prior to the 30th
of June in order to obtain payment of the July
coupon in cash. The question now raised in
the market is whether in the future only such
stamped bonds shall be, deemed good for de
livery here â a question which naturally alarms
the bears and will affect further International
dealings in Spanish bonds.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 24.â A decline at Liverpool,
where an advance was expected on the rise
here yesterday, started wheat weak. Septem
ber opened at from 67% c down to 67% c and slid
off to 67% c in a very few minutes, the latter
showing %@lc decline ". from yesterday's final
price. - There were plenty of buyers iat the.
concession .:' so . readily offered ; and there was
soon enough of It .to ' cause a : quick recovery
to 67% c. In addition to the ; bearish influence
of lower foreign markets was the perfect con
dition of . the ' weather throughout the : region
where harvesting is in progress. Accounts of
crop prospects â  from â¢ the spring wheat region
were of the most encouraging- kind. On this
news the selling sentiment dominated and
prices sagged. The market continued to drop
on . advices from St. Louis and seven â - cars of
v No. 2 red had arrived there. The trade was
more or less nervous over Armour's position.
Ills larc<- Interest in cash wheat led . ninny
to think that he might undertake to manipulate
the futures in the , bull interest. . The selling
was rather cautious and more in the way of
liquidation than In short selling. The lowest
prices of the day were â¢ made near the close.
July left oft l%c lower and September l&@l?4c
lower. .
Fine weather caused a drop at the start.
Holders of puts bought on the break and. pre
vented any further decline during the first
half of the - session. - Later, when wheat be
came heavy, corn followed, closing *A@%c

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, June 24.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Reflection of the advanced stage
of the season Is found In a perceptible quiet
ing down of distributee trade in many parts
of the country, and accompanying this have
been announcements of the fixing of periods
of annual shut downs in many industrial lines,
but significant of the changed conditions which
now animate and control business, an com
pared with corresponding periods In previous
years, are the continued large gair.s In the
volume of bank clearings over preceding years,
quite favorable reports from most of the coun
try's leading industries, notably Iron and steel,
in which next year's wage scales are being
adjusted with unexampled ease, comparatively
heavy exports of cereals and the products from
most of the leading ports, and rather less than
the usual shading of prices common at this
period of the year as the result of the advance
into the midsummer period. Following 'the
demoralisation In wheat prices come a more
steady tone and the growth of a feeling that
perhaps the "bear" movement In prices may
be overdone as was the "bull" movement,
which culminated a month ago.
With the exception of a rather spotted con
dition of the whole crop in different States,
chiefly as the result of too much moisture, the
crop situation in the country, as a whole, has
rather improved. Less is h^nrd of extravagant
wheat crops, Tiut the production of a crop of
wheat In excess of all previous totals Is ex
pected.
The iron situation has not developed suffi
ciently to allow of any very pronounced fore
casts of next season's business. Concessions
made by employers, however. In this line would
seem to Indicate confidence In a continuance
of a large business at least at prevailing prices,
which. It should not be forgotten, are in numer
ous instances higher than they were a year
ago.
The tone of cotton manufacturing has quite
perceptibly Improved, this being due perhaps
nn one hand to the placing of large amounts of
bleached goods at price concessions and to the
development In some degree of the Eastern
demand for summer fabrics. Less satisfaction
is expressed In the woolen goods trade, and
business here Is classed as slow and unprofit
able, with raw woo! reflecting dullness in
manufacturing and In unchanged Eastern quo
tations.

DUN 1 REVIEW. .â 
, NEW TORK, June 24.â R. a. " Dun A . Co.'s !
( Weekly Review of ; Trade ; will ' say In â  to-mor
row's issue: Very little of the new business
seen. In proportion to the aggregate, has been
caused by the war. Not any, discoverable by
ordinary tests, has been prevented by war.
Neither hat the collapse of the wheat specula
tion caused the excessive relative decrease of
shipments, for exports continue remarkably
large. Gold comes or does not come, as we
want it, the world's markets being evidently
at our command. An offering of bonds by the
Government brings out at the start bids for
more than three times the amount offered,
while the popular subscription already for
three-quarters of the amount exhibits in strong
light the confidence of the people.
Wheat ceased to fall and begins to rise in
price because foreigners' needs are not yet
satisfied. Atlantic exports for the week were,
wheat and Hour Included, 3,246,2*15 bushels,
against 1,445,947 last year; Pacific exports, 517,
152 bushels, against 57,059 last year, and the
demand is not of a speculative character. The
world's need of grain is greater than ever and
213,821,567 bushels of wheat and 207,317,483 bush
els of corn have gone abroad already, with a
week to spare, far more than, was ever before
exported in one year. After falling to 80c for
cash and 77\c for July wheat rose to 83c for
cash and 79c for July, with foreign demand.
Corn was steady without much fluctuation,
exports being 2,574,723 bushels for the week,
against 1,660.922 last year. Of other grain ex
ports have been unusually heavy.
The industries, at the season when stoppages
are to be expected, maintain production sur
prisingly. There are very few interruptions on
account of labor and wage scales for the com
ing year have nearly all been amicably set
tled. The iron Industry is very dull at the
East, with the complaint that prices do not
rise, but at Pittsburg and the West the works
are getting more business constantly and are
even competing so sharply that prices are
slightly lower for bars, cut nails, steel rails
and gray forge, while Southern iron is also
offered lower there than at the East.
The enormous demand from agricultural re
gions for implements, fencing, cars, railway
equipment and all sorts of building is the new
feature of this remarkable year. Minor metals
are fairly steady, with tin at 15.2 c, lake copper
at 11.75 c, with 22,741 tons produced in the
United States' and 6486 abroad in May. and
lead is strong at 3.95 c, with only moderate
transactions.
Wool Is stronger a shade, 100 quoted by
Cates Brothers, averaging 18. 20, against 18.64 c
June 1, but because of Western demands,
which are relatively 4c above prices which
manufacturers will pay, excepting to fill, im
mediate orders. As the future of the trade is
In doubt, though with more hopeful prospects,
sales of wool have been, in three weeks, only
11,695,300 pounds at the three chief markets,
against 29.585,100 in the same weeks last year
and 23.728,200 In the same weeks of 1892. Cot
ton has weakened 3-16 c, with excellent crop
prospects, but a larger demand for goods 19
seen, though not as yet enough to cause any
advance in prices. Reports of distribution are
generally encouraging.
Failures for the week have been 285 In the
United States, against 216 last year, and 11 in
Canada, against 24 last year.

FAMILY RETAIL MARKET.
Butter and Eggs are slightly cheaper. Cheese
is unchanged.
Meats show no particular change. Poultry is
cheaper. '
Vegetables from the districts around the bay
are now coming in and the market is well
supplied. Fruits are selling rather, above the
normal this year, owing to the shortness of the
crop. There have been |no pears of any conse
quence thus far, something strange. Apricots,
too, are not over plentiful. A few seedless
Grapes are coming in from Yuma, but they are
too dear for the ordinary purse.

DEMOCRATS
ARE AWAKE
Warren English Now a
Strong Candidate.
DRAWING FROM MAGUffiE
J. AUBREY JONES MAY MAKE A
FIGHT FOR CONGRESS.
Ward Clubs Being Organized by the
Friends of the Men Who Want
the Nomination for
Governor. v
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 24.
During the past few weeks the Demo
crats have been doing some quiet work.
No clubs have yet been organized, with
the exception of one Maguire club, but
the leaders of the party in this county
are quietly feeling around to test the
strength of candidates for Governor.
It is pretty well understood that that
branch of the Alameda Democracy which
is prominently identified with Prison Di
rector Fitzgerald is favorable to Ma
guire, but the little Congressman has a
very powerful competitor in this county
and possibly in Contra Costa County, in
"Warren B. English. Since it was dis
covered that Mr. English was quietly
making a canvass in many parts of the
State, with a view to securing the nomi
r.ation for Governor, there has been a
marked increase in his local strength.
The fusion proposition in this county
may be said to be still in abeyance, al
though there has been much opposition
from both Populists and Democrats to
ward repeating the failure of 1896. The
question, however, is not decided, al
though many of the Populist ward and
township clubs have reported to their
County Committee that they are opposed
to anything but a straight middle-of-the
road policy. Six months ago there was a
movement started to organize Maguire
clubs all over this county, but it did not
meet with general approval from the
Democrats, and since Warren English
took an active part in trying to secure
the nomination himself, much of the
strength of the Congressman from the
Fourth District has been diverted to the
local candidate.
The Democrats have not as yet done
anything toward naming candidates for
the Legislature, admitting on all hands
that this is such a strong Republican
year that to be nominated in this county
on the Democratic ticket is to court cer
tain defeat.
Dr. Pardee carried his campaign into
Alameda last night and held a. gathering
at Linderman Hall. Pardee spoke, and
In his speech paid a high compliment to
his opponent, W. R. Davis, pledging him
self to support Mr. Davis should he ob
tain a majority of the delegations.
Friends of W. R. Davis organized a
Davis Club in the Third Ward last night.
W. M. Dimick was elected chairman and
George F. Neece vice-president. An exe
cutive committee will be named next
week.
It is rumored that Jonn Aubrey Jones
may, in the event of a combination of
Iree silver men of all parties, be a can
didate for Congress.
WOMEN ORGANIZE.
Will Try to liaise the Moral and
Social Conditions.
OAKLAND, June 24.â Articles of incor
poration of the Oakland Civic Club were

their object the betterment of said city."

OAKLAND, June 24.â The Supervisors
this morning took up the matter of pro
tested constables' claims, and Attorney
Is'usbaumer and C. E. Kinard indulged in
many uncomplimentary exchanges. Mr.
Kinard's witnesses were not heard, as the
Grand Jury was considered to be the
proper body for such an investigation.
Mr. Nusbaumer told Kinard that he was
mistaken if he thought that an attempt
would be made to buy him (Kinard) off,
end the two men were fighting with their
tongues when the finance committee de
cided to postpone the matter indefinitely.

MONEY IS READILY GIVEN
OAKLAND TO BE DECORATED
FOR ONE WEEK.
Committee Promises a Celebration
Such as Was Never Seen
and Invites the
County.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. June Si.
The Supervisors have decided that they |
will help materially in the Fourth of July I
celebration and this morning voted to \
appropriate $500 to Oakland and $100 to
the new town of Tesla. Supervisor Mitch
ell is chairman of the executive commit
tee and brought the matter before the
board. John A. Britton of the finance
committee of the celebration said that
they were arranging for the biggest cele
bration of any place in the country, and
that It will be far superior to anything
that will be seen in San Francisco.
The Supervisors did not need asking
twice and readily voted for the appropri
ation. The City Council has already vot
ed $500 for the same purpose.
The decoration committee met thi6 j
morning and opened bids for street decor- j
ations. The contract was awarded to j
the Jones Bazaar Company, who will dec
orate Broadway, from First to Sixteenth
street and Washington from Seventh to
Fourteenth. On the corner of every street j
large wings of national colors are to be j
hung. All these decorations must be in
place not later than Thursday of next
week.
The invitation to the civic societies to
parade is being widely accepted and it is
anticipated that not less than 6000 people j
will march.
The committee this morning issued the
following invitation:
OAKLAND, Cal., June 23, 1898.
To the Citizens of Alameda County: Oak
land will celebrate the coming Fourth of July
with a grand parade, a sham battle, in which i
two regiments from Camp Merritt will take j
part, a bombardment of Morro Castle and its
destruction, and you are cordially invited to |
be present.
It will probably b? the most unique and !
thrilling celebration nf the Fourth of July ever i
observed in Alameda County, and the favor j
Bhown us by the commanding officers of Camp
Merritt should be recognized and appreciated :
by a general and enthusiastic attendance of
the citizens on this side of the bay. "Ee
member the Maine!" Patriotically yours,
JOHN" MITCHELL,
Chairman Executive Committee.
The fireworks committee is now en
gaged in arranging for special features
and many new ideas will undoubtedly be
devised. Part of the fireworks display
will be on Lake Merritt and part at
Adams Point.
Officers from the army headquarters in
San Francisco visited Oakland to-day to
inspect the territory where the sham bat
tle is to take place, and to make arrange- j
ments to insure its success. There has \
never been such general organization and ]
enthusiasm shown regarding any Fourth

pare with that which now prevails.

Sergeant Ripley of the First Montana
Regiment, drove to Adams Point with a j
committee of citizens and outlined the ;
ahasn. battle. - Serg^e&nt Rfpley made

of combat. One body of troops win start j
from a point a quarter of a mile east of i
the Piedmont bath house; another body i
will be stationed to the east of the head !
of the east arm of Lake Merritt, and
others will be at the foot of the knoll
north of the golf club house.

Mrs. Cochran Missing.
BERKELEY, June 24.â Mrs. J. T. Coch
ran is missing from her home on Clare
mont avenue. She has been away since
Wednesday morning, and all attempts to
find her have proved of no avail. Her hus
band has reported the case to the police
of San Francisco and Oakland. He is
of the opinion that his wife left during
a fit of temporary insanity, possibly due
to the fact that she has been an invalid
for several years. Mrs. Cochran is 52
years of age. When last seen she was
carrying a small valise and sealskin
sacque, wore a gray dress and a blue
and gray shawl. Mr. Cochran has tele
graphed" to all her friends and relations
in this locality, but his efforts so far have
been unsuccessful.

on the March to
Camp.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 24.
Tho Oakland military camp wili be lo
cated on the Sather tract. This was de
cided this evening by Lieutenant Colonel
Carrington and Quartermaster Heller,
after consulting the owners and the man
agement of the Haywards electric road.
The new camp site is situated between
Fruitvale avenue and High street, and
consists of eighty acres, which is well
sewered and can be easily supplied with
water.
The plans of Ira Bishop, v. - .iich were
laid with such nicety and so diplomati
cally carried out, have fallen through,
and his rival, Andy Stone, has gathered
in the big plum of the street car travel
for his company.
The officers named by Governor Budd
to decide upon a camp site in this city
were over here this afternoon and were
met by a citizens" committee, who es
corted them to a special car of the Hay
wards railroad, in charge of Secretary
Andy Stone. The Sather tract was in
spected at Fruitvale, and after lunch
Lieutenant Colonel Carrington and Quar
termaster Heller were taken arwund Pied
mont and shown the sites visited by Col
onel Henshaw on Wednesday.
Henry Pierce objected to the use of his
private race track at Brookdale tne site
favored by Colonel Henshaw, but offered
the officers a site ai Fruitvale free of
cost, which will be considered.
At the armory to-day the boys of Com
pany F were busy preparing to go into
camp. They have been advised that they
must march out next Tuesday, on which
day companies will also arrive irom San
Jose, Chico and other points. Company
A, greatly disappointed at being passed
by, has decided that it will be proper for
it to escort its brother company to the
camp, and this it will do, together with
its band.
The owners of the new camp have been
notified to have it ready for troops by
Sunday.
STANDARD OIL PEOPLE
BUYING COPPER MINES
Powerful Combine to Work the Rich
Lodes of Michigan and the
Great Lakes.
HOUGHTON, Mich., June 24.â The
Standard Oil people have long monopo
lized petroleum. For the past five years
they have been prominent in iron ore
more prominent with each year. For the
first time they have become identified
with copper, the details being made pub
lic to-day. For nearly two years Nathan
F. Leopold, a well-known steamboat man
in Chicago, has been engaged in tying up
property in Lake Superior copper dis
trict. So cleverly has his work heen ear- j
ried on that until to-day the full scope I
of his operations have been known to but !
half a dozen of his most intimate busi
ness associates.
The cat was let out of the bag, how
ever, when the organization of the Ar
cadian Copper Company was perfected
to-day in Boston. The directors elected
by the company were as follows: Albert
C. Burrage of Boston, president of the
Boston Gas Light Company; William
Rockefeller, president of the Standard
Oil Company; Nathan F. Leopold of Chi
cago, of the marine firm of Leopold &
Austrain; Henry H. Rogers of New York,
vice-president of the Standard Oil Com
pany; Henry G. Foreman of Chicago,
president of the Ogden Street Railway
Company; William A. Paine of Boston,
of Paine, Webber & Co., a brokerage firm
which has been very prominent for sev
eral years past in big copper mining en
terprises; Sidney Chase of Boston, of
Chase & Barston, treasurer of the Bos
ton Stock Exchange; and J. H. Rice of
Houghton, cashier nf the National Bank
of Houghton. Albert C. Burrage of Bos
ton was elected president, Nathan F.
Leopold of Chicago general manager and
Charles D. Burrage of Boston secretary
and treasurer.
The property of the Arcadian Copper
Company comprises seventeen different
mineral tracts, for which nearly fifty
different deeds were required. The prop
erties so acquired comprise the old Ar
cadian mine, the Edwards mine, the Con
cord mine, the Douglass mine and various
tracts from Sault Ste. Marie's Canal Com
pany and other owners of mineral land,
including a valuable mill site on Portage
Lake. The complete property as organ
ized to-day comprises the magnificent to
tal of 2846 acres, and 'embraces within its
limits the Huron, Kearsarge, Isle Royale
and other well known copper lodes, in
which half a dozen of the great mines of
the district are opened.
The Arcadian has two and a half miles
on the outcrop of the lode, and has an es
timated depth of over two miies in sink
ing, at an angle of 55 degrees, which is
the pitch of the vein as opened. Actual
mining work has been under way at the
Arcadian and adjoining mines owned by
the new company for the past year, and
200 men are now employed in developing
the mines, which force will be douuled as
soon as the necessary accommodations
can be secured for the men.
Treading on the heels of the sensation
when two millions of Standard Oil cash
were invested in a Houghton mine, comes
the sale of the Minnesota and adjacent
mines in Ontonagon County, which have
just been bought for $4,000,000 by Detroit
capital. The Minnesota was worked thir
ty years, paid millions in dividends and
produced a single mass of pure native
copper weighing 1,000.000 pounds. Mining
work is to be resumed immediately.

WERE CAUGHT
IN THE ACT
Opium Smugglers Ar
rested at Honolulu.
THEIR SCHOONER WRECKED
THE VENTURE WAS MADE BY A
PUGET SOUND RING.
Luigi Tschech Made a Desperate
Attempt to Take His Own
Life on Union Street
Yesterday.
News of an Important opium seizure
came from Honolulu by the Peru. The
old opium ring which had Whaley, the
notorious smuggler, at its head, and its
headquarters at Victoria, B. C, has been
reorganized and for a time did a land
office business in the drug. The profits
can be Imagined when the fact is known
that opium manufactured in British Co
lumbia can be purchased In Victoria for
about $7 a pound, and the same article
will bring $45 a pound In the Hawaiian
Islands, where its Importation Is prohib
ited.
The new combine owns three schooners
â the Henrietta, Lena L and Labrador.
The two first named vessels made suc
cessful runs from Victoria, B. C, to the
islands, landed their cargoes and got
away again, but the Labrador was caught
and Captain John Haake and Albert
Weinriche, alias Wilson, were in prison
when the Peru sailed.
The Labrador left Victoria, B. C, on
April 23 last, and her clearance papers
called for a cruise in the North Pacific
"in search of sea otter." When caught
off the coast of Oahu the captain said
he was going to land Weinriche, who was
sick, and that was the reason he ran in.
The vessel was searched, but nothing was
found on her. Then the Japanese cook
gave the whole business away and point
ed out where a thousand 5-tael tins of the
drug were hidden. This was seized, but
in the meantime the Labrador had drift
ed ashore and she will probably be a total
loss.
The Peru brings the news that the
plague, which haa been epidemic In
Hongkong, Bombay and Calcutta, is
abating.
Luigi Tschech of the furniture firm of
Delucchi & Tschech, 479 Union street,
made a desperate attempt at suicide yes
terday. With a knife he cut himself
over the left eye, slashed his left cheek,
cut his left wrist and his left ankle, and
then made two big gashes in his throat.
He was taken to the Harbor Receiving
Hospital, where Drs. Zabala and Green
sewed up his wounds. They think there
is a chance of saving his life. Officer
Langdon found Tschech in a small back
room of his furniture store bleeding pro
fusely. He is an opium fiend arid his wife
says he has been crazy for a week past.
The big German bark Theodor that ar
rived from Sydney, N. S. W., has 1500
tons of coal aboard for the San Francisco
and North Pacific Railway. She will
dock alongside the freight slip at Lom
bard street and discharge into freight
cars. The latter will then be put aboard
the steamer Ukiah and taken to Tiburon.
The remainder of the Theodor's cargo is
for the San Joaquin Valley road, and it
will be discharged into lighters and towed
to Stockton.
Captain H. C. Thomas has succeeded
Captain David Wallace on the steamer
Queen. Captain Wallace will go out as
Clem Randall, late master of the
tug Fearless, now the "United States
steamer Iroquois, has gone to St.
Michael in command of the new river
tug Ernest E. Hamill.
Another haul of young striped bass was
made at the ferries yesterday. "Joe"
Mogan discovered a thousand pounds of
fish under weight being smuggled in, and
he at once confiscated it and sent the
consignment out to Camp Merritt.
The annual strike took place on Jack
son-street wharf yesterday. During the
winter months the deckhands and long
shoremen employed on the river steamers
have their wages reduced $5 a month.
Then in the summer, when business is
rushing, it goes back to the old rate.
The owners of the steamers always re
member when the time to cut wages ar
rives, but they never know when the rise
is due. Then the men go on strike and
in the course of a few days the ship
owners give in and things go on as usual
for another twelve months. Yesterday
150 men struck for a-n advance of $5 a
month for deckhands and 10 cents an
hour for longshoremen.
For the term ending June 24 the fol
lowing graduates of McNevin Brothers'

Honolulu was very much worked up
over the failure of the Peru to appear
on time. She was quarantined at Kobe,
Japan, for five days, and the Hawaiiana
thought she had gone direct to San Fran
cisco to serve as a transport. In conse
quence, all the mails that were Intended
for transportation oy the Peru were sent
on the United States gunboat Bennington,
which will probably not reach here before
Monday next. At one time there was
some talk of chartering the steamer
Claudine and sending her up with mail
and passengers.
The Peru stopped the second fleet or
transports and took all the mail the boys
had to send to their friends at home, bo
that it is now in the postofflce here being
distributed.

ORE FROM THE POINT
WHERE TROOPS LANDED
Armor Plates on Many of Sampson's
Ships Probably Made
From It.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Jnue 24.â A
curious fact is that ore shipped from
the point where the American troops
landed is usually reduced at the Car
negie Iron Works. It is not at all Im
probable that the armor plates on
many of the vessels in Admiral Samp
son's fleet are made from ore that came
from the mine there.

PETITIONERS HAD NO PROOF OF
MISMANAGEMENT.
Decision Rendered by Judge Troutt
Exonerating the Jurist â Order
for Distribution of
Moneys.
Attorney E. Q. Knapp, who not long
ago, on behalf of Eastern heirs, he al
leged, filed a petition for the removal
of Judge John Hunt as executor of the
estate of George F. fcharp, was rendered
hors de combat in the legal battle with
out a great struggle yesterday. As the
hours of trial passed by it became more
and more manifest that Knapp was in
court without a case and minus evi
dence to support it if he had one.
'lhe result was that Judge Hunt still !
occupies the position of executor of the :
estate, a position which he has capably i
filled for fifteen years to the satisfaction j
of all the heirs, who had an opportunity â 
of investigating his management, and a !
Judgment of the court will soon be hand
ed down which will act as an estoppel to !
any such proceeding as the one just dis
posed of, which was characterized, not
withstanding vigorous protestations from
Knapp, as "a slanderous, unwarranted j
attack, having no basis and Badly lack- j
ing In verification."
The filing of the petition for the removal !
of Judge Hunt as executor of the rich !
estate caused considerable comment at .
the time, but none unfavorable to the ex- i
ecutor. It was charged in the petition
that the estate had been grossly miaman- I
aged; that the duties of the executor us ;
Judge ot the Superior Court prevented
him from properly curing for the Interests
of the heirs; that the executor had failed
to sell When lie should have disposed <>i'
property arid sold when such a proceeding
resulted in loss to the estate. The peti
tion further declared that owing to such \
mismanagement the value of tne estate
had been reduced not thousands but hun
dred of thousands of dollars,
"When the case was taken up by Judge |
Troutt yesterday two petitions were on
lile for hearing â one for the removal of ;
Judge Hunt, the other a petition of the >
executor for leave to mortgage property I
belonging to the estate for the- sum of '
$35,000. The first petition was contested j
by Judge Hunt and the second by Attor- |
ney Knapp, who was conlident that it |
was not to the best interest of the estate
to mortgage the real estate as proposed. I
This b<ing the fact, the executor and the
attorney representing the Eastern heirs
stood as opponents in each action, their
positions, however, as petitioner and re
spondent being reversed.
The petition to mortgage the real estate
was first considered by the court. Attor
ney Knapp had made a prior statement, I
in which he stated that ue represented
i U yen heirs who reside in N^v.- York.
These heirs are entitled to ono -fourth vi
the estate, he said, and strongiy opposed
mortgaging the property, but were in
favor of selling a portion of i: in order
that all claims against the estate might
be settled and the property distributed.
On the other side, however, Mrs. Hmwia
Sharp, widow of George F. Sharp, and
Eliza Sharp, representing three-fourths
of the estate, were anxious that the prop
erty be mortgaged and all claims settled.
The claims at present against the estate â 
amount to about $33,000, exclusive of taxes
and other incidentals, but owinx to tne I
generosity of the executor, tne attorneys
and the widow of George r\ Sharp, the !
amount of $?.5.000 will be amply si rtlcient j
to meet all olbligations that may arise !
prior to the final settlement < f the estaie. |
Mrs. Honora Sharp originally held claims ;
against the estate for $31,000, It it compro
mlsed on a figure of $25,000 in order to |
expedite the final settlement of tne es- I
tate. The commissions of Judge Hunt I
amounted to $45"0, and the attorneys
representing the executor, Sullivan & Su!- j
livan, had claims against the estate !
amounting from $10,000 to $20,000, but in
order to satisfy demands of creditors and
reach a settlement the amount due JudsÂ°
Hunt was reduced at his suggestion to
$3000, and Sullivan & Sullivan agreed to
accept, in satisfaction of all demands, the
sum of $5000.
These nominal figures represented
$5000. These nominal figures represents i
almost the entire fees requested after
almost sixteen years of litigation, during
which period thirty suits had be?n fllÂ«=-d
by and against the estate, and a large
majority resulted favorably to the heirs,
who, as alleged by Knapp, Bought to re
move the executor, and, incidentally, the
attorneys whom he had chosen to rtpre
sent him.
Judge Hunt was first placed upon the
stand. He gave his reasons why in his
opinion the property should be mortgaged.
Knapp questioned the jurjst at length in
a vain endeavor to sned favor on the
stand taken by his clients. Judge Hunt
left the stand, and then, to the surprise
of Knapp, Attorney Mat Sullivan intro
duced statements from a number of the
Eastern heirs represented by Knapn who
signified their willingness to have the
property mortgaged. When all the docu
mentary evidence was in it was found
that Knapp's clientage had reduced so
that he represented but 23-lGoths of the es
tate. As he had no evidence to prove thÂ«
wishes of that small percentage the case
went over at 5 o'clock in the evening un
til 8 o'clock to give the surprised attorney
an opportunity to get letters he said he
had in his possession that would estab
lish the stand his clients had taken.
When the court" reconvened at 8 o'clock,
however, Mr. Knapp was unable to pro
duce letters signifying the wishes of his
clients bearing- a date later than the state
ments Introduced on behalf of the execu
tor, and the case stf>od submitted.
The petition for the removal of the ex
ecutor was next taken up and Attorney
Sullivan filed in court the answer of Judge
Hunt to the petition asking for his re
moval. It entered a general denial to all
the allegations of the petition. At this
point Knapp arose and addressed the
court. To the surprise of Judge Hunt ana
his counsel, Knapp stated tfcat on a re
consideration of matters he was of
the opinion that the interests of his
clients would best be subserved by a dis
missal of the petition. He stated that
personally he had no desire to prosecute
the action and needs must take exception
to the remarks of opposing counsel char
acterizing the petition as slanderous, false
and without foundation. The petition, he
said, made no attack upon the integrity
of Judge Hunt as a man, neither did it
criticize him, but Judge Hunt as a man
and Judge Hunt as executor of the es
tate of George F. Sharp were different
beings. He requested, however, the dis
missal of the petition.
This action did not meet with the ap
proval of opposing counsel, who insisted
that the case be heard, that the evidence
disapproving the allegations might go on
record. They did not wish a dismissal,
as the next day similar unbased ani
false charges, they said, might be lodged
against their client. They wished a judg
ment based upon findings that would act
as an estoppel to similar actions that
might be instituted in the future through
a spirit of revenge or otherwise.
'"We wish to go ahead with this mat
ter," said Mat Sullivan, "that we may
prove the motive that prompted the f.i
ing of this petition. I reiterate my *'ate
ment that the charges are false, slaoder
ous and unwarranted, and 1 wish to ts
tablish the facts with competent evi
dence." â¢
Again Knapp objected to the state
ments of counsel, and asked that the
proceeding be summarily dism'ssed, but
the court took the view as suggested by
Attorney Sullivan, and stated that fnd
ings would be drawn up and '.ho judg
ment based on them. Judge Troutt then
made an order permitting the cou-t to
mortgage the property, as requested in
the petition.
Prior to making the order Judg-> Troutt
stated that Judge Hunt was too w*;i
known In tbe community to put fortn a
defense to the charges brought against
him; that his character and integrity
were unimpeachable, a-nd tho charges to
the contrary lai ked verification. In con
sequence, the petition :iskirig for his re
moval was denied. The court then signed
an order for the distribution to the heirs
of motleys received from the sale of min
ing property belonging to the estate, and
court stood adjourned.

The sub-committee arranging for the j
i Fourth of July committee put in a day of |
â  hustling yesterday, and as a result have
secured promises which Insure a turnout
of at least 9000 soldiers. This does not in- |

| meantime and will be available. The com- ;
: mitteemen are in hopes that all the bri- \
i gade commanders will turn out at the
1 head of their respective columns, but i
i have received no assurance that such will â ,
|be done. The troops pledged to parade
; are as follows:
lowa regiment and band, Tennessee ;

Chief Lees has promised to keep the <
i streets clear if it is necessary, and call
â  out the entire force, and a platoon of

TO PRISON FOR LIFE.
Nineteen-Year-Old Boy Sent to Prison
by Judge Wallace for Complicity
in a Robbery.
Joseph Windrow's youth did not save
him from life imprisonment yesterday.
Although numerous appeals were made to
Judge Wallace for a light sentence the
Nemesis of crooks proved obdurate. He
stated that sentences were imposed not
only for crime, but chiefly a's a protection
to society.
The unfortunate boy was mixed up in
a robbery which occurred a month ago
in which the proprietor of a grocery store
on the corner of Pacific and Mason
streets was badly beaten. All engaged in
the crime were arrested. Joseph Theron
and George Barker, the leaders in the
robbery, were sentenced a week ago D>
the same Judge to life imprisonment, ana
in meting out the Â§ame punishment to
young Windrow Judge Wallace followed n.
precedent he established years *ago.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, June 24. â Washington
Park will open to-morrow for a twen
ty-five days' running meeting, the first
since the summer of 1894, when the agi
tation against races made all of the
Chicago tracks close their gates. As
usual, the special feature will be the
American Derby, with $10,000 added
money. The race, while lacking the
high quality that has characterized it
in former years, Is a very open one and
will undoubtedly bring out a close con
test. There are nine probable starters,
although the right to declare out or
start within forty minutes of the race
makes the number uncertain. Plaudit
and Ueber Carl will not start, the for
mer having been shipped to New York
to train for the Realization, and the
latter having pulled up lame on Thurs
day morning after working the dis
tance in 2: 36iÂ£, without being dis
tressed.
Of those left. Mirthful, A. H. and D.
H. Morris' candidate, will be the most
fancied, chiefly on account of his good
races in the East. Pink Coat, which
won the St. Louis derby last Saturday,
beating Plaudit, also is well thought of.
In this race he will have to carry
twenty pounds more than he did a
week afro. Isabey, the winner of the
Detroit Derby, and Ed Farrell, which
has won some good races at St. Louis,
are new comers and add to the uncer
tainty of the outcome. Following are
the derby entries, with weights and
jockeys:

MEETS DEFEAT
Knocked Out by "Spike"
Sullivan.
EXHIBITS GREAT GAMENESS
IIAS THE BETTER OF IT jjOR
TWENTY ROUNDS.
Left Swing on the Head Does the
Trick When the Californian
Appears to Be a
Winner.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 24.â "Spike" Sulli
van of Boston knocked, out Dal Haw
kins, the lightweight boxer from Cal
ifornia, in the twenty-second round of a
twenty-five round bout to-night at the
Lenox Athletic Club. These two men
met at 133 pounds and put up an ex
cellent fight. Hawkins had the better
of the contest on points up to the
twentieth round, when Sullivan floored
him with a left swing on the head.
Every one though the fight was over
right there, but Dal surprised them by
regaining his feet in six seconds. He
was very groggy, but game to the core.
Sullivan, flushed with apparent victory,
rushed wildly and tried to land an ef
fective blow, but in his anxiety and
haste missed each attempt, so the bell
Interfered.
Dai's legs were weak whe.n he came
up for the twenty-second round, but
the blow which floored him in the
twentieth round had evidently done its
work more forcibly than outward ap
pearances indicated. The Californian's
friends took heart at seeing their man
come to time so gamely and thought
that he would last the limit; but. after
a minute of fighting, Dai's chances
wero quickly settled by a terrible right
swing on the jaw, which put him out.
His seconds worked over him for near
ly five minutes, while the spectators
were yelling like crazy people. Dal
finally came to, after a few minutes,
and was able to leave the ring unas
sisted.
The Western sporting men lost a lot
of money by the defeat of Hawkins, as
all through the fight they kept back
ing him at liberal odds on his chances
of success.

GRAND JURY
AFTER FERRY
DEPOT FRAUDS
Members Spend an Afternoon
Making a Personal
Investigation.
The Building Demonstrated to Be a Gaudy
Sham Instead of a Solid Monument to
the Wealth of This Great State.
Yesterday was a bad day for Presi
dent Colnon of the Board of State Har
bor Commissioners, lie received a visit
from members of the present Grand
Jury.
To speak more correctly, the visit
â¢was not paid to Commissioner Colnon
personally, but to the new ferry depot
building. The object of the visit was
the inspection of the building for the
purpose of ascertaining the details of
the frauds by which the State has been
robbed of more than $100,000 by means
of the manipulation of contracts.
No one but members of the Grand
Jury was invited to be present at the
Inspection, but during the course of the
afternoon all of the Harbor Commis
sioners dropped in, one after the other.
Supervising Architect Swain, whose of
ficial approval has been given to all of
the changes and various other kinds
of jugglery that have resulted in such
rich profits to favored contractors and
such great loss to the State, also
strolled in to see what was going on.
During the course of the afternoon he
was joined by a majority of the em
ployes and petty officials in the employ
of the board. None sought to intrude
on the little band of jurors, but they
hung about on the outskirts and kept
a cautious eye on the proceedings that
mean so much or so little to those who
have been accused of being responsible
for the Jobbery that has marked every
stage in the construction of the build-
Ing.
Those of the grand jurors who par
ticipated in the investigation were
Foreman M. H. Ilecht. J. D. McKee, J.
B. Stetson, J. J. Rich. Luke Battles,
Samuel C. Irving and George A. Kohn.
About three hours and a half were con
sumed in going over the building, and
at the end of that time the jurors ex
pressed themselves as being firmly
convinced that the apparent frauds
were so numerous and so costly to the
State that it would require several
weeks of patient investigation to get
at the facts and fix the responsibility
on the proper persons.
The ferry building is now almost com
pleted, with the exception of the mez
zanine floor, which is to be left un
finished because the numerous raids
that have been made by favored con
tractors on the treasury have exhausted
the appropriation of $600,000. The build
ing presents an imposing exterior, and
parts of the interior are sufficiently
showy to catch the eye and elicit the
admiration of the casual observer.
From without the building seems to be,
as it was intended to be, a monument
to the wealth of a great State and the
public spirit of her citizens. Yester
day's investigation disclosed the fact
that the monumental walls enclose
nothing but a gaudy sham that is a
disgrace to the State and a reproach
to the officials who are responsible for
Its existence.
Access to the main floor Is g-ained by
a broad night of steps flanked by a
wainscoting of highly polished marble.
â At the head of the stairway one steps
at once into the grand nave, the floor
of which is paved with mosaic. In the
floor the tiny blocks of stone, furnished
by the contractor, form infrequent is
lands in the sea of cement, furnished
by the State, in which they are set.
The marble wainscoting observed on
the stairs stretches away on both sides
In polished elegance. Above this are
brick walls, spotted and discolored, in
place of the Roman pressed brick and
tiling called for in the original plans
and specifications and paid for by the
State. Overhead the translucent glass
In the skylights is cracked and broken,
faulty construction having already be
gun to make itself apparent.
Beyond the grand nave and running
parallel with it is the waiting room,
which extends fr nn end to end of the
lengthy building. Here are no marks
of elegance. Cheap plr.e partitions and
wainscoting appear in place of the
polished oak contracted for and paid for
by the State. Pine doors close the
openings that were to have been closed
with pretentious fireproof, steel shut
ters. Above the wainscoting the walls
are covered with sheets of galvanized
Iron, nailed to the studding like shin
gles to a roof. The sheets of iron are
buckled and billowy, because the con
tractor was allowed to evade the speci
fications of his contract and thereby
effect a saving to himself in labor and
material of something like $8000. At
each end of the waiting room the walls,
which are the end walls of the build-
Ing, are built of common red brick of
the kind of which chimneys are con
structed. The brick is covered "with a
nwt of plaster, which in turn Js cov
ered with a coat of paint. The State

contracted and paid for Roman pressed
and molded brick at the ends of the
building, butâ well, the State did not
get what it paid for.
Beyond the waiting room is the rear
gallery, which also extends the entire
length of the building. The walls of
the gallery are covered with galvanized
iron, and in elegance and artistic ef
fect resemble a hen house in the Chi
nese quarter. Here also the contractor
reaped a rich harvest by ignoring the
provisions of his contract.
The mezzanine floor, which was to
have been the permanent home of the
State Board of Trade and other in
dustrial organizations, is a wilderness
of staring beams, floorless joists and
cobwebs. Instead of being the home of
industrial institutions it is the home of
b^ts and rats. The combination of tin
sel and sackcloth to be found in the
gaudy nave, the poor but dishonest
waiting-room and the poverty-stricken
and mournful gallery have eaten up the
munificent appropriation and there was
nothing left for the mezzanine floor.
A pjtrt of the information gleaned l>y
the grand jurors was the fact that the
original plans and specifications ur.itar
which all of the contracts were let

pensive material and finish both in-side

WORK FOR LABORERS.
The San Mateo Railway Will Expend
Thousands of Dollars on
Its Road.
It is the intention of John A. Buck and
Nicholas Ohlandt of the San Mateo and
San Francisco Electric Railroad, to begin
rebuilding its park branch of the road
over Eighteenth street, from Guerrero to
Danvers, where the switchback turn con
nects with Eighteenth.
On this line at the present time there
is but one track of rails with a turnout
half way between Guerrero and Danvers.
This will be done away with and a double
track laid the entire distance with heavy
steel rails such as have recently been
put down on the main line from Market
to Thirtieth street. As soon as the road
is finished the time schedule will be
changed from twelve to five minutes, as
the running time now is very unsatisfac
tory to the thousands of Mission people
who prefer to patronize this line because
of its charming scenery and general cour
teous treatment from the employes of
the road.
In addition to this, the managers of the
company will begin work on the road
from Ocean View to Holy Cross Cemetery,
where similar material will be used, and
instead of the old jolting line one of the
very best and most substantial street raij
roada In the world will be ready for their
patronage. .The line will be completed
in about two months.
The work contemplated by the owners
of this line will involve thousands of dol
lars, all of which will be distributed
among the people of this city for laboi
and material.
PASSING OF E. P. IVORY.
Universal Sorrow Expressed for the
Death of the Former Clerk of
the Railroad Postoffice.
General sorrow is expressed for the
sudden death of Edgar P. Ivory, a former
clerk in the Portland and San Francisco
Postoffloe, who met death at Ashland, Or.,
on June 23, away from friends and loved
ones, while on a mission of duty. The fol
lowing testimony of regret was tendered
und published by the employes of the
Postofflce, the deceased's fellow-work
men:
It ia with a feeling of the deepest sorrow
that this office Is compelled to make the an
nouncement of the death of our beloved com
rade. In the passing of Ivory the department
loses an attentive empolye and the clerks a
courteous and friendly fellow-worker.
That death called, on him while yet In the
performance of his duty proves him to have
been adherent to the jjust and noble prin
ciples that actuated even' action both in his
private and public career. Though death beck
oned to him when for away, let us hope he
wont on hts last lons mission with resigna
tion and full confidence of a happiness here
after.
The sympathies of all the clerks In this divis
ion toward the widow, ill in body and mind,
and the family that dwells In sorrow, find
universal exi>re;*?i<>n. and Is by this office
as earnestly tendered.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 25, 1898.
"RAWHIDE GOLD"
ENLIVENS THE
NEVILLS CASE
George W, Baker's Fierce Assault
Upon the Acts of the
Prosecution.
Exceedingly Hot Language Used in a Police
Court Brief Charging Unfair Actionâ The
Parties Indicted and Arrested.
The notorious Nevills case, which has
occupied the attention of Judge Joach
imsen's court for over seven weeks, and
which has branch actions In the United
States District Court and the court in
Fresno, has taken another turn, which
makes it, if possible, more odorous.
The new phase grows out of the dispo
sition of the case in the Police Court yes
terday. On Monday George AY. Baker,
attorney for the defendants, Elsie Wil
liams, Grace Loose ami one Azhderian,
made a motion for dismissal on the
ground that no evidence had been ad
duced by the prosecution upon which to
hold the defendants. District Attorney
Barnes and Prosecuting Attorney Gra
ham opposed the motion and it was
agreed that each side should file a brief
for the guidance of the Judge, who said
he would render his decision on the mo
tion Friday. Attorney Baker was ready
and the District Attorney stated that he
would have his brief in the hands of the
Judge on Wednesday morning. It was
submitted promptly, but after its peru
sal Judge Joachimsen met Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Dunne and stated that de
fendants' brief was very skillfully and
carefully prepared and that he was sur
prised that the District Attorney had not
GEORGE W. BAKER, the Attorney Who Wrote the Fiery
Brief in the Notorious Nevills Case.
taken the trouble to more fully answer I
the allegations. His Honor also stated '
that if there was any further evidence j
to come from the prosecution ho would j
continue the case from yesterday till
Monday next.
No further showing was made by the I
District Attorneys office, and when the j
cause came up yesterday it was made i
known to the Judge that the prosecution
had been practically abandoned in his i
court and that the prosecution hacl gone j
before the Grand Jury and obtained in- i
dietments of the defendants. As this ad
vanced the rase to the Superior Court,
Judge Joachimsen stated that there was
nothing left for him to do but dismiss
the charges and exonerate the bondsmen.
This was accordingly done, Prosecuting
Attorney Graham stating incidentally i
that he : -*ntirely concurred in the state
ments made in Baker's brief, and consid
ered the action of the prosecution an af
front to the court, whether it was inten
tional or not.
The recital of 'the evidence in the case
and the deductions therefrom, In Attor
ney Baker's brief, make very warm read
ing, such as is seldom seen in a docu
ment of the kind. A sample of the vehe
mence of Mr. Bilker is shown in the fol
lowing extract from his allegations re
ferring to Azhderian and Miss Loose:
Why should the court be asked to do what
the prosecuting witness hus not done, namely,
<JH,-Inre that these two defendants have made
threats and extorted money from the prosecut
ing witness, when the witness himself did not
even hint at such a thing? What does it mat
ter In the face of these stubborn facts what
Azhderian said to any other person, or who
sat on his lap, or under whose bed his shoes
were, or how far he walked barefooted, or
whose leg he was going to pull, or how much
money he expected to make, or any other of the
nifs* 01 trash that was wrung into the record,
the garvaman being did he threaten to ex
pose Nevills to his wife for adultery, and by
reason of such threat did Nevtlla part with his
â property? Most assuredly not. and neither
did Mrs. Ijoose; and as to them it does not
come to a question, an stated by the District
Attorney, aa to the weight of the testimony.
There is absolutely no evidence to support the
charge at all as against these two people.
In drawing conclusions from the evi
dence the brief further says:
Barely, it is such an open perversion of the
testimony In the case as to cast a suspicion
upon the pood faith and candor of that ofllcer
whose duty is not to persecute people nor ask
for their incarceration when it must be known
to him that neither the law nor the evidence
warrants it. The Â£tate Is not looking for vic
tims, even if that green-eyed, lecherous se
ducer of woman's virtue who swore to the
complaint in this case is.
After enumerating various so-called in
consistencies in the prosecution's allega
tions Attorney Baker concludes his
heavily charged document with the fol
lowing caloric assertions:
Since the foregoing matter was reduced to
form I am advised that the District Attorney
hns marshaled his witnesses before the Grand
Jury and procured the Indictment of these de
fendants by that moot august tribunal.
Again the yellow metal from the Rawhide
mine intrudes its hydra head. In one of the
public journals this morning the following
paragraph appears:
"For some time past Elsie Williams, Grace
JjOose, her Bister, and Myron Azhderian have
been in the Police Court as defendants, the
charge preferred against them by Captain
Nevllls being extortion. District Attorney
Harnes, not feeling satisfied with the Pollre
Court pTE-oeedings, had an examination of the
chief witnesses before the Grand Jury and se
cured indictment."
What occasion has been shown In this case
for the District Attorney tr> abandon a prose
cution In the Police Court that he has kept
In motion for more than seven weeks? Is it
the law that defendants shall be dragged from
their homes, placed under heavy bonds, re
quired to dance attendance upon a court for
nearly two months, where the proceedings have
been orderly and legally conducted and all the
facts connected with the crime brought out
and reduced to â¢writing, the case argued and
submitted, and the day before Judgment is to
. be announced in a secret and star chamber .
fashion go before the Grand Jury anil usÂ© the
power of hie office to have the defendants in
dicted, thereby Ignoring the proceedings which
himself instituted In this court or the right
of this court as a judicial officer to announce
Its conclusions upon the testimony? Is it any
wonder, therefore, that the common people
should make outcry against tlie methods pur
sued by these scions of the law? Have the
people any rights against the demands of
purse-proud prosecutors?
This is probably the first time in the history
of judicial proceedings in this court where
such an extraordinary proceeding as this has
been attempted, and this, too, for the sole and
only reason that It is well known to the court
and to every person who listened to this testi
mony, that this prosecution was malicious upon
the part of the prosecuting witness, was with
out probable cause, and an indictment was the
only remedy to shield the prosecutor from the
civil consequences of his dastardly act. But in
this effort he will find later on that he Is only
adding fuel to this flame. This floated liber
tine will find that it will take more than the
Rawhide mine to shield him from the effects
of outraged justice, and that while he may
have temporary successes In star chamber
methods, the full glitter of daylight will yet
be thrown In upon his past history and he will
have to come out Into the open and meet the
defendants in a fair and open contest.
I ask, therefore, that these defendants be
discharged from custody, that their bonds be
exonerated and that this court should make an
entry In its docket and judgment that the
prosecution is malicious and without probable
cause.
As a result of the action of the District
Attorney the defendants were arrested
yesterday and landed in jail with bonds
fixed at $5000 each.
UNHINGED BY TROUBLE.
Suicide of Samuel Kornfield, a Re
tired Grocer.
Samuel Komfiold, a retired grocer.com-
I mitted suicide last Thursday night at his
I residence, 248 Twelfth street, by inhaling
the fumes of illuminating gas.
The widow says that she returned home
last Thursday evening about midnight,
escorted by her son. They opened the
door of his room and found him lying
j dead in bed with both gas jets turned on.
So far as the relatives would say there
could have been no motive for the sui
cide.
Yesterday afternoon the son of the dead
man brought to the Coroner's office a
letter written in pencil by the suicide. It
was in Arabic characters in the English
language and the following translation
was furnished by the son:
To the Honorable Coroner of the City and
County of K;in Francisco: It is my duty as a
citizen of the t'nited States to Inform you
| that you shall send somebody to find out my
! trouble for the last two years and publish It
for the benefit of the public, and to show the
public how far a foolish partner brings a per
son. It Is impossible for me to write all my
troubles on Sixth and Folsom all around. My
trouble could be learned off the streets. Re
member the llaine. I was your true citizen.
S. KORNFIELD.
I cannot support my family further and did
not care to support them with disgrace. Amen!
With the namo of Axelrod is the foundation
of my trouble.
Kornfield was a native of Austria, 4S
years old. He leaves two married sons
and two married daughters. An inquest

THE COPTIC HEBE.
She Sighted the Second* Expedition
This Side of Honolulu.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Coptic reached port from
Hongkong, via Yokohama and Honolulu,
last night, and anchored in the stream at
the foot of Powell street. Captain Sealby
reports that some distance this side of
Honolulu a fleet was sighted, which he
took to be the second expedition of troop
ships for Manila, though the distance was
so great that he could not ascertain defi-
The Coptic left Hongkong on the 29th
ult., Yokohama on the 9th inst, and the
run from Honolulu was made in 5 days
24 hours. There are on board the vessel
Â«ixty-eight cabin and about 200 steerage
passengers. Nothing was seen of the ilrst
fleet of troopships nor Â«>f the Charleston,
Monterey and Monailnook. It was ex
pected that the remains of Captain Kid
lev would be brought over on the Coptic,
but they were left on the other side.
The Wasp This Week.
As the representative illustrated weekly
of the Pacific Coast the Wasp this week
is more than ordinarily noteworthy.
There is no end seemingly to its enter
prise. First of all. the lowa regiment is
pictured by companies. The crack Astor
Artillery battery is also pictured, and a
number of general camp scenes are also
presented. Captain O'Connell's company
of the First Infantry (regulars), who were
the first troops to land on Cuban soil,
were photographed especially for the
Wasp on the return of the famous Gussie
expedition, and the photograph is pub
lished in this number. T)wÂ« there are pic
tures of celebrities in the theatrical world.
In fact the Wasp is full of pictures. How
ever, the literary features and cartoons
have not been curtailed.
