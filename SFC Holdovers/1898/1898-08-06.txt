ACCEPTED THE TERMS
MINISTERS
AGREE UPON
HER REPLY
Points Regarding the Phil
ippines to Be Further
Discussed.
The Decision of the Cabinet to
Be Submitted to the Queen
To-Day.
NEW YORK, Aug 6.â A cable to the Sun From Mad
rid, dated August 6, 4:40 A. M., says: At the Cabinet
meeting last night the Ministers agreed upon a reply to
the United States accepting the United States' terms of
peace without prejudice to the discussion of certain
essential points regarding the Philippines.
They will communicate the decision to the Queen
.Regent to-day. Her agreement is considered assured.
It js now believed that Sagasta will continue in power.
MADRID, Aug. s.â ln a conference
between Senor Sagasta and Senor Sil-
vela "the latter urged that it was im
perative to summon Cortes for the
â -m?ax>ti&u'on ef a treaty of peace.
â¢ General' Polavieja, why was present,
â¢ declined subsequently to speak of the
. conference to a representative of the
press, on the ground that his duty as a
â¢ soldier imposed secrecy upon him, but
.â¢General Azcarraga said that if Spain
possessed adequate resources the war
iihould be continued in order to secure
more acceptable conditions, otherwise
' peace ought to be immediately con
â¢. eluded,
'/."General' Chinchilla, Captain General
: of- Madrid, said: "We have a brave
and " well-disciplined army, and it is
ready to go wherever it is. sent,"
â¢ '. liater Senor Sagasta conferred with
"^Senor. Saimeron, the Republican leader,
â who told the Premier, In the course of
a long conference, that he blamed the
Government greatly for closing the
Cortes and stifling the press. After the
â¢ interview he said he had assured Senor
â¢ Sagasta said he would reserve nis upin

Chamber was convoked, but that
-.neither directly nor indirectly would be
support the "existing oligarchy, which j
is the" cause of all Spain's misfortunes." j
At the Cabinet council this evening
Senor Sagasta recounted to his cot
leagues what had been said in the cor.
ference with the war political leaders
'.. early in â  the day. No decision was
. taken.. ' .
\ ? Sehor Puigceiver, Minister of Fi- j
. nan.be, read a proposal to increase the j
â¢note circulation and guarantee of the j
â¢ Bank of Spain.
â ' â¢The council also considered an official
""dispatch from Santiago, signed by Gen
eraj Toral, saying that owing to the
. amal'lneSs of the camp which the Amer
" icans had conceded, the absence of
tents and the improper food the nura
.ber'. of Spanish sick had increased to
â¢ 10,000, the death rate being from twelve .
("to- fourteen daily. The dispatch also
: said- that the beds now were altogether
' Insufficient for so large a number of
sick, so-ldiers, and that their transporta
tion home ought to commence imme- J
,'.dfa.tely. General Toral informs the |

President McKinley the substitution for '
the- word 'possession' of another word'
meaning practically tho same thing."
This revelation foas caused a ferment ;
here. It was understood at first that

for tha future government of the Phil
ippines. It is bettered the powers will

SPAIN'S DELAY IS
NOT UNEXPECTED
NEW YORK, Aug. s.â The Herald's
"Washington correspondent sends the
following: Spain's apparent delay in
formally accepting the terms proposed
by the United States as conditions for
ending the war is causing no concern
to officials of the administration. The
delay is in no sense unexpected. When
the second note was presented to Em
bassador Cambon on Wednesday, in
reply to the one of inquiry as detailed,
the Embassador stated several days
would elapse before a final answer
could be expected from Spain. All the
members of the Cabinet with whom I
talked to-day feel reasonably sure that
when Spain.is next heard from her note
will be a full and formal acceptance of
the terms proposed by the United
States.
I am assured there has been no hitch
in the negotiations: that the last ex
change of not^s, as previously stated
in the Herald, related solely to the'man
ner of carrying out the general terms
proposed by the United States, and that
the mere fact that Spain had begun
negotiations respecting these details
was accepted as a foregone conclusion
that the general principles laid down
by the United States as conditions for
peace were approved by Spain. As in
dicating the confidence the President
has in the early acceptance by Spain
of his proposals, it may be mentioned
that he is still giving consideration to
the personnel of the proposed commis
sion for the settlement of the Philip
pine question. It cannot be said he has
yet puttied upon any one, but it is re
garded as certain that General Stewart
L.. Woodford will be one of the com
missioners. Among other names men
tioned are former Secretary Tracy,
former Secretary Olney, Senator Davis,
former Senator Edmunds and also
j Benjamin Harrison.
CAMPOS PUBLICLY
IN FAVOR OF PEACE
MADRID, Aug. s.â The conferences
j between the political leaders on the
subject of the peace terms continue.
Benor Sllvela, the Conservative leader,
acting in behalf of Senor Castelar, the
Republican, who was prevented by ill
ness from being present, has conferred
with the Premier, Senor Sagasta, on
the subject. He said Senor Castelar,
although an advocate of peace, was of
the opinion that in negotiating the Gov
ernment "should remember the Vir
ginius affair, when the energy dis
played by Spain in dealing with the
United States saved Spanish interests,
and he thought every effort should be
made to preserve Spanish sovereignty
over Porto Rico.." Senor Silvela added
that he personally did not favor any
change of policy.
The Liberal, moderate Republican,
to-day publishes an interview with
Marshal Martinez de Campos, who is
quoted as saying: "I openly favor
peace. Everything that has happened
in this war could have been foresee.!,
but the most pessimistic could not nave
imagined that our misfortunes would
be so greatâ the destruction of Monte
jo's and Cervera's squadrons, the sur
render of Santiago and the rapid and
unresisted occupation of Porto Rico.
No one could have imagined it even
taking into consideration the superi
ority of tho United States. Neither the
present Government nor any other can
change our situation. It would be mad
ness to think of rejecting President Mc-
Kiniey's terms. The Liberal party en.il
bring" about peace, but Sagasta should
not be asked to sign it, and another
Liberal Cabinet should be constructed."
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, AUGUST 6, 1898.
Marshal Martinez de Campos, it is
pointed out, evidently referred to Senor
Gamazo as the man who should suc
ceed Senor Sagasta as Premier. Senor
Gamazo is the present Minister of Pub
lic Instruction. His name has been fre
quently mentioned recently in connec
tion with the Premiership in the event
of the formation of a new Cabinet.
PARIS, Aug. s.â The Madrid corre
spondent of the Temps telegraphs this
afternoon that there is no danger of
any uprisings in Spain. He adds that
everybody is desirous of peace, "though
profoundly deploring the necessity of
making such great sacrifices."
HOW SAGASTA TRIED
TO GET BETTER TERMS
LONDON, Aug. 6.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Standard says: Senor
Sagasta has prepared for submission to
The Auxiliary Cruiser Badger, Formerly the Ward Liner Yutnuri, Capturing Three Spanish Vesselsâ Tug, Barge and Brigantine â With 400 Soldiers,

GOVERNOR SANCHEZ IS
READY TO SURRENDER
CITY OF MANZANILLO
Recognizes the Futility oF Further Resistance,
But Wants to Insure His Own
Safety.
Special Cable to The Call and the TfeTr York Herald. Copyrighted, ISOS,
by James Gordon Bennett.
SANTIAGO, Aug. 5. â Manzanillo, blockaded by the Hist and Hor
net, with the wrecks of six gunboats and three large merchant ves
sels strewn along the beach, and with the insurgents uhder Salvador
Illos pressing the city closely from the east, is anxious to surrender
to the American troops. Negotiations have already been started,
and Commander Lucien Young of the Hist yesterday sent a commu
nication to Admiral Sampson suggesting that another demonstration
be made before Manzanillo by a part of the American fleet to pave the
way for the city's surrender.
Colonel Sanchez Pieron, the Spanish Governor In Manzanillo, is
cut off from all communication, has only 2000 troops, many of whom
are sick, and recognizes the futility of further resistance. He is ready
to surrender Manzanillo unconditionally, provided the American fleet
will make a demonstration before the city in such for^e .is to save
him from being court-martialed for surrendering. The only impor
tant defense the city had, the pontoon Maria, which was equipped
with twelve-pounder smooth-bores, was sunk during the bombard
ment on July 18 by the Wasp and the other warships commanded by
Commander Todd, who left the place with nothing availably for with
standing an attack by sea. Little damage was done in Manzanillo
by the shots from the American vessels. Our flre was not directed at
the town itself, although one shell set fire to the hospital, which was
burned to the ground. Three soldiers and one woman were killed.
Through General Shafter the Herald and The Call were the only
newspapers allowed to send a reporter on the San Juan when It went
from here to Manzanillo to get the families and baggage of General
Esc^rio's officers.
the leaders whom he consulted a most
interesting sketch, not only of the pre
liminary negotiations and soundings,
but also of M. Cambon's efforts to in
duce President McKinley to leave the
Porto Rican question open for future
negotiations and to get better condi
tions for . Spain in the Philippines,
where he was more successful, as well
as to induce the President to select
some neutral European capital instead
of Washington for the meeting of the
peace commission.
Senor Sagasta also submitted reports
from all quarters bearing on the ques
tion. Undoubtedly it would have been
better for the country's interests had
the personages consulted remained si
lent. The revelations of some of them
are hardly calculated to strengthen the
Government's hands.
General Weyler, in a curt note, de
clined to enter the conference, but pro
posed to reply if Senor Sagasta would
put his queries in writing.
WAITING FOR SPAIN'S
FINAL RESPONSE
WASHINGTON, Aug. s.â When the
President closed his official work to-day
he had not received the reply oÂ£ Spain,
nor any intimation as to how soon the
reply might be expected. The French
Embassador had not been heard from
throughout the day, and he, as well as
our Government officials, was waiting
for Spain to give the final response.
Two days have now passed without a
word officially from Spain, either in the
way of inquiry or response. From this
It is clear that the Spanish Cabinet
fully realizes that the time for an ar
gument, counter-proposals or modifica
tion has gone hv. and that there is
only one simple issue to be met, namely,
whether the American terms will be ac
cented as a whole or rejected.
There is indeed reason to believe that
the Spanish Government has been di
rectly advised that the stage of nego
tiations is past, and that only the mat
ter of an answer, favorable or unfav
orable, remains. That the answer has
not come quickly is no matter of sur
prise to the officials here, for they re
alize the tremendous responsibility
which Premier Sagasta must assume in
! making these peace terms sufficiently
! palatable to the Spanish populace and
the political leaders to permit its ac
ceptance without an internal convul
sion. In his conference with the Presi
d-.it and Secretary Day the French
THE AFFAIR OFF NEUVITAS.
Embassador has brought out clearly
the great task before Sagasta.
It seems to be the general view here
that if the Premier and his Ministry
were untrammeled an acceptance
would come at once and that the pre
liminary peace arrangement would be
now closed. But in preparing the
Spanish public and in guarding against
political agitations hereafter by public
men of other parties the Madrid offi
cials are taking their time for mission
ary work not only among themselves
but*among all the populace and secret
elements. The best informed persons
here fix next Monday as the time when
the United States Government is likely
to receive Spain's final answer, but this
is simply conjectural, for there is not
the slightest means of knowing the
tendencies at Madrid. It might come
to-morrow, but in the event of its com
ing late in the day, or on Sunday, the
response would not be communicated
to the Government until Monday.
There is the same confident belief
among officials that there has been
from the first that Spain's answer will
be a reluctant but none the less conclu
sive acceptance. At the same time it
was suggested to-day in some quarters
that there was a possibility that the
disclosures made by the American gen
erals concerning the serious condition of
our troops at Santiago might be a straw
at which the Spanish Cabinet would
grasp. This is quite doubtful, how
ever, as there is a question whether
the statement of the American general
ever got outside the borders of the
United States, owing to the strict cen
sorship imposed last night. Moreover,
all evidence reaching the officials here
indicates that Spain is weary with the
conflict and is convinced beyond the
slightest question of the hopelessness
of further opposition.
PAINTED THE PICTURE
IN SOMBER COLORS
LONDON, Aug. 6.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Times, commenting
on the views of the various leaders ex
pressed at the conference with Senor
Sagasta, as given in El Liberal, says:
It seems that Senor Sagasta pointed
out all the facts of the situation with
the utmost frankness to the various
politicians, indicating reasons for and
against a continuance of the war, and
citing, for example, the fact that Gen
eral Blanco, so far from being dejected,
proposed plans to continue the resis
tance.
Senor Sagrasta's picture, as a whole,
however, was painted in somber
colors. Senor Montero Rios, President
of the Senate; the Marquis Vega
de Armijo, President of the Chamber
of Deputies: Marshal Martinez de
Campos, the Duke of Tetaun and Senor
Sllvela, the leader of the dissident Con
servatives, all favor peace.
The Duke of Tetuan, however, thinks
a Government of greater authority
necessary to negotiate the conditions.
Romero y Robledo. on the contrary,
evidently aims at playing the part of
Gambetta. He anticipates the time
when he may acquire considerable po
litical influence by reminding his fel
low countrymen that hÂ«Â» has had no
act or part in any negotiations looking
to a close of the war. It is worth not
ing that he declares his views are
shaped by General Weyler. So far as
I can discover these bellicose senti
ments find little or no echo in the pub
lic mind. It is said that Senor Emilio
Castelar, the Republican statesman,
authorizes Senor Silvela to declare that
he is in favor of peace.
MANY SPANISH SOLDIERS
ALSO ON THE SICK LIST
SANTIAGO DE CUBA. Aug. 4 (de
layed in transmission). â Major General
Rhafter has received orders to move
his entire army north at once. The six
transports here will take the first ship
ments, and the embarkation â will begin
to-morrow. There is great rejoicing
among the troops.
General Shatter's orders for the
movement of his command provide for
the following programme: The em
barkation of the Third and Sixth Reg
ular Cavalry; then the First Regular
Cavalry and First Volunteer Cavalry
(the Rough Riders) will be embarked.
These regiments have been ordered to
be ready to go on board ship the day
after to-morrow.
For the present the Ninth and Tenth
Cavalry will remain in camp. Only the
private horses of the officers will be
taken The other horses will be turned
over to General Wood, who remains
here aÂ» Military Governor.
General Toral, the commander of the
Spanish troops, sent a letter to-day to
General Shatter advising the latter that
the camp of the surrendered troops is
in an unhealthy condition. The Span
ish officer also reported that there were
several hundred sick in the hospitals
and that there was an average of
twelve deaths daily. The transports
expected here to carry the Spanish
troops back to Spain have not yet been
heard from.
General Shafter will take action at
once in order to improve the sanitary
condition of the Spanish soldiers and
their camp. -
PREPARING TO TAKE
CARE OF SHAFTER'S MEN
NEW YORK, Aug. s.â As soon as the
lumber and tents arrive work will be
pushed forward by day and night to get
the big army camp and hospital at
Montauk Point ready for General Shaf
ter's troops from Santiago. There will
be at least 1000 tents with five beds in
each tent. Colonel Forward says he
will have a sufficient number of new
nurses and physicians to care for the
pick soldiers.
TROOPS TO RELIEVE
SHAFTER'S ARMY
SAVANNAH. Ga., Aug. s.â Five
thousand troops are on the way to
Savannah to-day to embark on the
transports for Santiago to relieve the
troops there. The troops, which are
all immunes, are the Third Georgia
Regiment from Macnn and the Third
and Fifth Regiments from Columbia,
Miss. The Mississippi regiments will
arrive to-morrow.
SAGASTA REALIZES
THAT PORTO RICO
IS LOST TO SPAIN
So Governor Macias Is Ordered
to Ma^e the Best Terms hfe
Car) With the Americans.
Special Cable to The Call nnd the Xevr York Herald. Copyrighted, 189S,
by Jamei Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, Aug. 5. â The Government has given orders that Macias
should not force the resistance of Porto Rico to the utmost. This is
at the instigation of Sagasta, who deplores the unnecessary loss of
life, knowing that Porto Rico will inevitably fall into the hands of
the Americans. Macias is instructed to obtain terms like those ob
tained by Toral or better, so as to save Spanish honor as much as
possible.
OFF SAN JUAN, PORTO RICO, Aug.
4, by The Call-1-.erald dispatch boat
Sommers N. Smith to St. Thomas. D. \V.
1., Aug. s.â Another successful landing
on the island of Porto Rico was made
by the Americans at daybreak this
morning and the Stars and Stripes now
wave over Cape San Juan. The Puri
tan, Amphitrite and Montgomery which
have been cruising about the north
western coast of the island awaiting the
arrival of the army transports ap
proached Cape San Juan early this
morning, and a small party, made up
of men from each of the American ves
sels, was sent ashore at daybreak.
The landing party was in charge of
Lieutenant Commander James R. Self
ridge of the Puritan, Lieutenant Field
of the Amphitrite and Lieutenant At
water of the Montgomery. They took
possession of the lighthouse and raised
the American flag. No opposition to
the landing of the American party was
offered, and this leads to the belief that
the Spaniards have abandoned Fajardo
battery. Lieutenant Dresil of the Puri
tan, with Dr. Hancock and Ensign
Bierer, went in behind Obispo Island
with a launch and took as prizes the
schooner Encarnacion and sloop Guerra
Flora. All the small towns in the east
ern part of the island evidently are
anxious to surrender peacefully.
The New Orleans has been left alone
to continue the blockade of San Juan
harbor. The German steamship Poly
nesia was stopped inside the blockad
ing line this morning.
Governor General Macias is doing his
utmost to bolster up the courage of the
Spaniards, and he has published a
proclamation denying that overtures
for peace have been made by the home
government. It is reported that the
Governor's daughter is helping train
Spanish gunners.
PENNSYLVANIA TROOPS

JUAN DIAZ, PORTO RICO, Auk 4.â
By the Call-Herald dispatch boat to St.

outskirts of Llamo de Coamo, but none
of the Americans were injured in the
fighting.
General Ernest's brigade, which is
marching along the military road be
hind the troops commanded by General
Hendy, is hastening to the seaport. The
Pennsylvania troops are now before
Coamo. General Ernest's men are tak

SIXTH MASSACHUSETTS
OFFICERS HAVE RESIGNED
PONCE, Porto Rico, Aug. 5 (via St.
Thomas, D. W. 1., Aug. 5). â General
Wilsons-to-day changed his headquar
ters from Ponce to Juan Diaz, and all
of the American transports lying off
the port of Ponce will be ordered to
Santiago. As a result of the inquiry
into the fitness of the officers of the
Sixth Massachusetts to properly per
form their duties, the colonel, lieuten
ant colonej and three majors of that
regiment have resigned.
AMERICANS CAPTURE
FUENETA AND CABEJAS
MADRID, Aug. s.â An official dis

habitants of Cienfuegos, anticipating a
bombardment of the city, have gone to
the woods, only leaving a few soldiers
in the blockhouses to garrison the town.
But little if any resistance would be
offered if it became necessary to take
possession of the city.2

Company's boat Dwyer were also held
in the ice. Th<> Merwin left Seattle on
the 10th of August last, and was ice
bound November 18. She was released ;
and started up the river June 8. Her j
passengers had a hard experi
: ence. Three of them died. On Febru

i lack of proper nourishmentâ in othÂ«Â»r
, words, starvation. The entire party
was reduced to the plainest living, hav
i ing exhausted si-^h luxuries as milk,
butter and sugar long since. Many of
the passengers went ashore and built
j cabins, while others stayed aboard the
j boat the entire winter. With the sprint?
' flood those on shore were compelled to
camp on the tops of their houses for
â  several days, and many lost all they
had: On June 7, from a man in a small
boat that had come down from Dawson
behind the river ice, they received the
first news from the outside world since
they left Puget Sound in August,
! learning that the United States was at
I war. Following is the brief history of

The Alice, that also wintered at Min
evek Creek, arrived on the evenii
the 4th. bringing a number of passen
gers Kicked up on the river. She had
no through passengers, that is directly
from the outside, save two Mrs. Cathie
and daughter â who came over from St.
Michael by <log team just before the
steamer sailed.
The Alice suffered somewhat from
the crush of ice at the breaking up of
the river, and her barge w:ip submerg
ed find sunk and a quantity of the
i cargo lost. She came up the river with
j such a heavy load that she was twice
j compelled to stop and cache, part of it
in order to get through the flats. Even
then she was twice heM on sandbars
for over nine days. She has arrived in
good order, notwithstanding, and
brought up a big cargo.
She brought up the following named
passengers: Mrs. Cathie and daughter,
George Harrington, three Sisters of
Mercy. H. Raymond, Dr. Le Claire, W.
R. Wheaton, Stanley Fay, F. R. Bates,
Tom D. Drew. K. 8. Heap, g. P. Mc-

Stanley Fay and Mr. and Mrs.
Beecher were among the passengers of
the Excelsior who sailed from San
Francisco last July, bound for thin
place. They wintered at Minook. If
they had been delayed twenty-two days
longer they would have been just one
year on the way. Gabriel Cohn, an
other of the Excelsior's passengers, ar
rived on the Hamilton, having re
mained all winter with her. He also
remained with her on her return trip
down the river. The Alice's passengers
who were there during the winter all
speak weil of ihe Minook diggings, and
say that Rampart City is certain to be
a prosperous camp. Those who spent
the winter with the boat at Minook de
clare that the' little steamer Thomas
Dwyer, that wintered at the same
place, will not be able to get up the
river, as she lacks power to buck the
current. When the Alice passed her
she was making a struggle that ap
peared to all of them to be futile. Her
passengers, if they get here at all,
must come by some other boat.
The Governor Stoneman, tugboat,
that left San Francisco on August 9
List with a party of sixty-five, which
it was to bring up the Yukon on
barges, arrived here yesterday with no
barges and just nine of that party.
They are: Dr. C. J. McGovern, George
Morris, George Rosella, A. K. Varney,
H. Richrath, Ed Shaser P. Sullivan,
If. H. Davis, D. La Montagne. Most
of the party went back from St. Mi
chael of Dutch Harbor. Of those who
attempted the river the following is
the history: Remained at Novekakat,
where the, steamer wintered â John
Alexander and John Bleidon; started
for the Koyukukâ O. Wiseman and
James Hastings; went to Minook by
dog team during the winterâ John
Mayne. J. M. Mehan, J. L. Sehofield,
Dan Holden, W. McKee, A. Johnson,
M. N. Kimball, R. L. Qulsberry and J.
P. Carson: stopped at Fnrt Yukon to
po prospecting from that pomt â
Thomas MeOnbe. Ed Mills, M. Blan
chard; stopped at Circle City â J. Crow
ley and Frank Joaquin.
F. H. Stevenson went back from
Nulato. having wounded his foot so as
to disnble him. Mat Braumagan left
the Governor Stoneman at Fort Yukon
and came up on the Bella. R. C. Nich
ols and Fred Hayworth, tired of wait
ing for the Stoneman to get off a bar,
left her in the flats and floated in a
small boat back to Novekakat to take
some other boat. B. F. Thomas went
to Circle City during the winter with
a dog team. A. Bafnaberg left the
Stoneman at Fort Yukon and came up
on the Alice. Joseph Steel, a man of
about 50 years of age, died from ex
haustion and exposure at Novekakat.
The little tug Hettie B, another of
the fleet of ill-advised ventures of last
summer starting from San Francisco,
arrived about the same time as the
Governor Stoneman. Of sixty-four
people with v.-horn she started only
seven arrived. They were: Captain
Corning, Robert Bain, .1. C. Murray.
M. O'Leary. J. A. Walsh, M. A. Nich
ols, F. E. Bovvers. A number of others
of the party came up on the Seattle
No. 1, and their arrival has been noted
in previous dispatches. Many went
back arrd a few are scattered along the
Elver, but the officers of the boat kept
no record of them. Both the Hot tie B
and the Governor Stoneham hid to
abandon their barges, as they were un
equal to the tas--k of bringing them up.
Ml c Hettie B, in fact, found great dif
ficulty in getting up herself, as she
draws four feet of water. The pas
s-users and crew of the Stoneman
were employed most of the winter in
fitting the craft to carry their thirty
tons of stuff up the river without the
barge To do this they took the boat
out of the water, cut her in two and
put twenty feet to her length with
lumber whipsawed out of the forest
They ma<l* a good job of it, under the
circumstances. Oakum and nails were
secured by dog team from Minook,
eighty miles away.
The history of every one of those hur
ried expeditions of last summer and
fall is a recital of disaster, loss, dis
appointment, a year of wasted time,
much suffering and death. This is the
story of those who crowded the decks
(,1- the Excelsior at San Francisco in
July and of the Humboldt at Seattle,
the Eliza Anderson, the May West and
the barges of the Thomas Dwyer, the
Governor Stoneman and the Hettie B.
and the St. Michael.
Hail storms, accompanied by heavy
thunder and lightning, have been fre
quent during the past ten days. The
river has risen considerably, relieving
anxiety about the expected boats from
down the river and the forest fires that
threatened to destroy the timber along
the whole upper river have been
quench. 'd. The forest tires have grown
from camp lires of the careless crowd
on their way in here.
I believe I have hitherto neglected to
mention the mosquito, about which so
much has been said. It was a gr.-ive
oversight. The mosquito is very num
- and a great nuisance in the
brush. P>ut the fact is he is scarcely in
evidence within the limits of Dawson.
Just why I cannot explain. Dawson is
on a swamp that would naturally be
expected to produce mosquitos without
limit, but it does not. Perhaps the peo
ple of the city are not good for mos
quitos. The mosquito of the brush â
up the creeks and elsewhereâ is just
now being supplemented by the little
black gnat, to the greater torment of
the miner and all who go among th^m.
The drowning In - hirty Mile River
of Kenneth Btewart of Inverness, Scot
land, is reportt 1 here, also of Rev. Mr.
Lybn of London and a companion in
Lake Le Barge. Kenneth Stewart was
oi f a party of five from the place
named, led by Rev. Dr. Mac Donald.
Their boat was wrecked and all their
goods lost. Dr. Mac Donald climbed on
k In the middle of the river and re
mained there for over two hours until
another boat came and so nearly struck
the rock thru he was able to catch
hold of It and go through to a landing.
Dr. Mac Donald has arrived here with
the three companions who were saved.
Rev. Mr. Lyon and his companion were
trying to cross Le Barge in canoes.
That of Mr. Lyon capsized and he was
taken up by the other boat. In trying
to recover some of their goods this
canoe di<o capsized and both were
drowned^ Rev. Mr. Lyon was a Church
of England missionary, bound for this
city.
PASSENGERS AND GOLD
FROMDAWSON CITY
Keturning Klondikers Tell of Hard
Times Ahead for Tenderfeet
in Alaska.
SEATTLE. Ayg. s.â The steam schooner
Dirigo arrived from St. Michael, Alaska,
this morninp with ninety-seven passen
gers and a small amount of gold dust.
Twenty-seven of the passengers were
from Imvson. The most of them went in
overland this spring. They never stopped
at Dawson but left right down on the
river t'i Si. Michael, where they took pas-
Bage on the Dirlgo. The remaining pas
sengers were laboring men from Unalaska
and tit. Michael. Of the Klonrlikers those
having i^< .l< 1 dust were Charles Moore and
J. 11. Brown Of Midland, Ontario, Canada,
who had about $70.W0 between them, and
11. Miller with about the mime amount.
]â ". \v. Spencer of Portland, Or., hart about
$40,000, made in steamboating on the Up
per Yukon.
It is estimated that the total amount of
gold '!> tin- Dirlgo was $200,000. J. H.
Brown said people are flocking out of
DawÃon aa fast as they know how. A big
<T.>wl is coming down the rtv^r in skiffs
and on rafts. There will be mu<-h suffer
ing at St. Michael unless the Government
Mini* relief to the crowd drifting there,
penniless and hungry. Alaska is a good
country and there is lots of gold there, but
a majority of the tenderfeet who rushed
in do not know how to handle it properly.
The Dirijfo left St. Michael July 23.
There was but little changp in conditions
at St. Michael. All the stranded steamers
except the National City and Progreso
are gradually working out of their
troubles and hope to get away soon. It
waa expected that the National City would
soon return to San Francisco with her
passengers. Tfce army officials are al
lowing pasengers from the steamers who
have no river connections to land if they
have 1000 pounds of provisions and are
willing to take chances on getting up tho
river. Under this ruling the Progreso
has landed about seventy-five paasenpers
out of her 300. The Tillamook had sailed
for San Francisco before tho Dirigo left.
TEXAS FEVER RAVAGING
FRESNO COUNTY STOCK
Many Horses and Cattle Dying in
the Pastures of Kings River
Bottoms.
FRESNO, Aug. 5.â A large number of
horses and cattle in the pastures of Kings
River bottoms, this county, have died of
the Texas fever, and by order of Veteri
nary Inspector Graham their carcasses
were burned. The fever is said to have
been introduced by a lot of cattle that
Crate Hayes brought from Texas some
years ago. Hayes 1 cattle were pastured
on bottom lands, and they communicated
the disease to other stock. Many oÂ§ the
cattle in the herd of 1500 which was
brought to this county died.
James Graham, the veterinary surgeon,
visited the infected herds this week, and
says there is no doubt as to the disease
being Texas fever. The fever, according
to his investigations, is not a new thing
in Fresno County. He says that for years
stock on Kings River bottom lands, Mus
nel Slough and on Grant have been af-
t â¢â , ted with splenic fever during the sum
mer months.

SUCCOR FOR THE
UNFORTUNATE ARMY
NOW AT SANTIAGO
Secretary Alger Had Taken Steps
for Removal Before Shafter's
Demand Came.
WASHINGTON, Aug. s.â ln proof of
the allegation that the War Depart
ment had bestirred itself to succor the
unfortunate army in Santiago before
the united protest was made the fol
lowing statement is given out by the
Secretary of War regarding the ship
ment of troops north from Santiago:
Until quite recently it was supposed
that yellow fever was epidemic in San
tiago, and it was not believed that it
would be safe to send shiploads north of
men largely affected with yellow fever.
The disease, it was believed, would spread
rapidly on shipboard, and result in the
death and burial of many at sen. On
the 28th ultimo the Secretary of War tel
egraphed to General Shatter that as soon
as the fever subsided the men of his
command will be moved north to a camp
that had been selected for them at Mon
tauk Point. On the 30th of July General
Shnfter telegraphed: "Made known Sec
i, . .-of War's telegram that troops
wou.d be moved north as soon as fever
subsided, and it had a very good effect on
the men."
When, however, the true condition was
made known an order was issued to Gen
eral Shafter to move his command north
as rapidly as possible, and all ships in
the quartermaster's service, possible to
get to Santiago, were sent there and
the great liners St. Paul and St. Louis
were also ordered there. All this was
done before the communication signed by
General Shafter and his generals r was re
ceived and before Colonel Roosevelt's
letter was published. Over 150 surgeons
are at Santiago, and 176 immune nurses
have been sent there, besides the ueual
hospital corps that always attend such
an army. There have been less deaths
in Santiago by yellow fever than by ty
phoid fever in any camp of the same size
in the United States.
The War Department has ordered
the regular fleet of transports at Ponce
to proceed to Santiago to join .with the
transports already there in bringing
General Shafter's army back to this
country. There are several l".Tge trans
ports with the fleet at Ponce, some of
them, like the Mobile, having a capa
city of 1000 men. In all, they have a
capacity for 6540 men. This, with the
ships already at Santiago, will give a
carrying strength of over 12,000 men
at a trip.
Surgeon General Sternberg has in
view several points for patients and
convalescents. The actual hospital
station will probably be located at
Montauk Point, where a field hospital
for 5000 patients is being prepared, in
addition to the hospital equipment
which General Shafter's forces will
bring along with them. But, besides
this, General Sternberg has in, view two
fine locations, where the bracing
mountain and lake air will help conva
lescents to recovery. These points are
Fort Ethan Allen, Vt, and the army
poÃt at Plattsburg, N. Y.
The following report of the sanitary
condition of the American camp at
Santiago was made public at the War
Department this morning:
The War Department to-night posted

These are.. "immune" regiments

they are more proof against such than

The immune regiment is distinctly an
American .institution- and an American
.innovation in the art of; war. Among
all the thousands of regiments that
make up the mighty hosts of .Europe
there is not a sing-In company Â.-,, of
"immunes." The Czar .would like to
have some for service in Siberia, where
he loses hundreds of his soldiers every j
year from the dread - Siberian fever.
England could use them well In India,
where the jungle- fever kills more
Englishmen every year than fall at the

Germany too, could readily find use
for a few regime-nts of "immunes" in
their African possession? and save the
lives hundreds of their soldiers, who

nations however, who make the prepa

have these, death-proof â  regiments.
They have not the material to recruit

in the early 80's Lieutenant Hood was
assigned to duty, on the Gulf Coast of
the Southern States and while there
was taken with yellow.. fever, at the ,
time somewhat epidemic. He had a.
severe case arid a. very narrow escape
having at- one time. been laid out fur
burial by his attendants. He recovered,
however, and when, the prospect of ser
vice in Cuba seemed certain he fully
realized the advantage that "immunes.,

danger from all its. kin and kind, would .

His idea soon took shape in definite
plans. He went to Washington and
laid them before Secretary Alger a.nd- :
the President, both" of whom fully ap- .
proved of the Idea and took Immediate
steps for carrying out his plans. A â¢
bill was introduced by the House Mili
tary Committee providing for the en- â 
listment of a sufficient number of "im
munes" to. form ten regiments of ,1038
men each. Six of them were to be
white and four colored. Colonel Hood
was appointed to the command of one
of these regiments and at once returned
to New Orleans and. began .recruiting.
He soon gathered., at.- Camp Caffery,
near the city and named after the Sen

to form two regiments, later two more I
were filled up in New Orleans. and with
recruiting in other Southern cities and
towns- the full number author' by
Congress has been nearly made up. j
There may be many other regiments
remarkable for uniformity of size,
color, nationality or whatever else, but
these immune regiments are. the most
unique military organizations in the
world without question. No matter
what other qualifications for enlistment

the two young men who originated
the Idea of starting a fund among
schoolchildren for the purpose of rais
ing money to build a battleship to be
called "The American Boy," are in the

"W. Ranklngood, Cincinnati, Ohio â
My Dear Sir: The circular which you
have presented to me outlining your
plan for raising a fund with which to
build and present to the Government a
battleship has greatly interested me.
Love of country and devotion to the
flag were never more conspicuous in
America than they are to-day, and I
am sure our boys and girls will deem
it a privilege to be numbered among
the contributors to this patriotic un
dertaking. Very sincerely yours,

SpÂ«clal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. s.â The Republicans
of Santa Clara County who have in
dorsed the manly and fearless words
of Chairman Major Frank McLaughlin
of the Republican State Central Com
mittee are determined to leave no stone
unturned to have a good, clean Repub
lican ticket to present to the public at
the election this fall. They are working
every moment to have the voters erf
each of the precincts of the county put
forward good honest men as delegates
to be voted lor at the primaries on Au
gust 10 â men who are opposed to bass
ism, corruption and fraud.
The "gang," with all its cohorts, is
circulating all manner of reports de
rogatory to the character and standing
of many prominent members of the
league.
The Good Government League was
organized six months ago and for the
sole purpose of ridding the Republican
party and the voters of Santa Clara
County of their grossest incubus â a po
litical buss, with his organized cohorts
and supporters. It's membership now
numbers over 1600, and tne time has
arrived when they are ready to come
openly before tne public. In keeping
With that policy the members held
their Initial open meeting at Moreland
Schoolhouse Thursday evening, where
a number of interesting speeches were
made by officers of the league and by
residents of the vicinity. Professor S.
B. baunders was the presiding olticer,
and the voters and their families turned
out in full force. When they left the
hall many were the determined re
marks to leave no stone unturned id
give the better element a fair oppor
tunity to express their choice at the
primaries. Baliot-bo-x Stuffing, illegal
voting, the voting of Democrats, iiit
gal ballot counting and many other
gang devices are expected, and the
Good Government League will endeavor
to prevent these frauds.
The movement headed by the Good |
Government Club is a general uprising
of the populace against the methods of
BOSS Rea and the Mackenzie*. For
years these politicians have run things
In Santa Clara County and few public
officers had the backbone to oppose
them. It was the crookedness of these
ringsters that has brought Santa
Clara County's name into ill-repute
and made It a by-word all over the
State. The fact that the leaders of the
gang were Republicans also cast odium
upon that party in the county, and all
honest and decent Republicans were
being: driven from their organization.
Things reached such a state that it be
came necessary for the better members ;
of the party to act In order to save the
county from either becoming Demo- '
cratic or Populistic. It was at this
time that the Good Government Club
was organized. In it the Republican |
voters saw their party's salvation and
the freedom of the county from gang
rule.
Jim Rea and the Mackenzles are wor
rit (1 over the outcome of the primaries
next Wednesday. For years they have
had things their own wa*- and now
that the Good Government Club has
decided to drive them from the Repub
lican party they hardly know which
way tn turn. In the past week they
have made desperate efforts to CT et their
forces t"K-th>-r. All th^ir Lieutenants
are hard at work, and they will do all
they can to down the better element
at the polls.
Th.' school system has been polluted
by the ring dabbling in Its affairs, and
thousands of dollars of needless ex
-ense have been saddled upon the tax
payers in order to supply soft places
for th'-Ir h'-n<-hinen.
The recent trouble in the High School
has dun.- a great deal to stir up things.
The revolt of the students against tin
dismissal of Professor L. R. Smith
from the High School has proved the
means of informing the pupils' parents
of the way things are conducted in the
School Department.
Charges of immorality in the school
were made from the pulpit by the Rev.
Dr. Macltjren a few weeks ago. A few
days after Boss Rea waited upon the
clergyman and asked him to keep qulot.
Hf said it would do no good to stir up
the matter and would give the s?hooi
a bad reputation. Dr. Maclaren re
fused to be hushed up by the boss.
Principal A. E. Shumate of the High
School has made eeveral trips to Dr.
Maclaren's residence on the same, mis
sion. During the past ten days Rea
has been stopping the High School
students on the Htreets and taking
them into his office. He tried to
coax the students to return to the boy
cotted school next term and when they
refused he used threats. It is safe to
predict that not over 100 of the 325
students of the High School will attend
next year. Most of them.will go to the
Santa Clara School, where Professor
Smith has been elected principal. Thus
the empty new $75,000 High School
promises to stand a monument to the
corruption of Boss Rea and the old
City Board of Education.
The meeting of the club to-morrow
will be the largest and most enthusias
tic ever held. All arrangements for the
primaries will be completed. Ad
dresses will be made by prominent
members.
FOB THE AMERICA'S CUP.
Sir Thomas Lipton Explains the Na-
ture of His Challenge.
LONDON, August s.â Sir Thomas
Lipton informs the Associated Press
that the Yacht Racing Association has
no jurisdiction in the matter of his
challenge for a series of races for the
America's cup, the Royal Ulster Yacht
Club having, as a matter of etiquette,
asked the approval and advice of the
association. Therefore, the Royal Ul
ster Yacht Club will issue an independ
ent challenge within a few days.
The fact has Just transpired that ten
days ago Sir Thomas Lipton visited
Marlborough House and presented the
Princess of Wales with a check for
Â£100,000 to start dining rooms in Lon
don, at which working people may se
cure substantial meals for from 2 to 8
cents. There will be a central dining
room, capable of accommodating 2000
people simultaneously. It is expected
that from eight to ten thousand din
ners will be served there dally. The
trustees, of which the Princess or
Wales will be one, will shortly be ap
pointed to manage the project, which
will be known as the "Alexandra
Trust."
CAPTAIN CHARLES E. CLARK, Who Has Been Invalided Home.
COMMANDER
CLARK IS ILL
The News a Shock to
His Friends.
HAS BEEN INVALIDED HOME
CHARACTER OF HIS ILLNESS
NOT KNOWN.
Captain Barker of the Newark Ap
pointeu to the Command of
the Famous Battle-Ship
Oregon.
Special Plapatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 5.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Captain
Charles E. Clark, commanding the bat
tleship Oregon, has been condemned by
the Board of Medical Purvey and has
been detached and granted six months'
leave. Orders to this effect were is
sued to-day by Secretary Long. This
was the result of a cablegram from
Hear Admiral Sampson announcing
that Captain Clark has been ill, and la
dow unfit to remain in command of
his ship. The cause of the officer's dis
ability Is not known. Secretary Long
and Captain A. S. Crowninshield, chief
of the Bureau of Navigation, had a
conference, during which it was deter
mined to transfer Captain A. S. Bar
ker, commanding the Newark, to the
battleship as Captain Clark'B SUC
re:- -. >r.
The news of Captain Clark's Illness
came ac a shock to his Washington
friends in and out of the navy, who
have followed with Intense interest his
notable trip from San Francisco
around the Horn to Florida, and noted
with added interest his conduct of thfe
( >i>'Kon in the battle with Cervera's
squadron.
It is believed at the Navy Depart
ment that Captain Clark is suffering
from some climatic affection, induced
probably by the tremendous strain un
der which he has been for months.
Captain Clark entered the navy on
the L'Dth day of September, 1860. He
was commissioned as captain on the
21st of June, I.SPG, and took command
of the Oregon on the 17th of last March.
He is a powerful man, both physically
and mentally. He has never known
what it is to be sick, having had scarce
ly a day's sickness in his life.
NEW YORK, Aup. s.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Tribune, tele
graphing of Captain Clark's illness,
says: For sorm> days it had been known
that the strain of overwork incidental
to the memorable voyage of his peer
less ship around Cape Horn and the
arduous tour of watch duty off San
tiago, culminating in the magnificent
dash past the other battleships when
Admiral Cervera attempted to escape,
had seriously affected Captain Clark's
physical strength and that he was on
the verge of breaking down. Only a
few weeks ago his responsibilities were
augmented by the selection of the Ore
gon as Commodore Sehley's flagship
and orders were issued appointing
Captain r],-,rk chief of staff.
The additional duties imposed by this
assignment were of an exhausting and
worrying character and they quickly
told on him. Naval officers fear that
Captain Clark's active career Is ended,
although in rare instances a period of
rest has resulted In the complete re
cuperation of officers under somewhat
similar circumstances, notably in the
case of Admiral Slcard. who was com
pelled to relinquish command of the
North Atlantic squadron several
months ago, but has been able to pre
side over the sessions of the Naval
War Board.

Kent's commands occupying the hills in
the vicinity of that place. After two
days' rest, Lawton was ordered forward,
and on the night of the ."Wth instructions
were given* by Major General Shatter to
this office to attack Caney, while the cav
alry division and Kent's division were
ordered to move forward on the regular
Santiago road. The movement com
menced on the morning of July 1. The
cavalry division advanced and formed In
line with Its left near the Santiago road,
while Kent's division formed its line with
the right joining the left of the cavalry
division.
Colonel McClernand of General Shaf
ter's staff directed me to give instruc
tions to General Kent, which I complied
with in person, at the same time per
sonally directing General Summer to
move forward. The men were all com
pelled to wade the San Juan River to
get Into line. This was done under very
mavy fire of both infantry and artillery.
Our balloon, having been sent right by
the main road, was made a mark of by
the enemy. It was evident that we were
as much under tire in forming the line as
we would be by an advance, and I there
fore pressed the command forward from
the covering under which it was formed.
It emerged into open space in full view of
the enemy, who occupied breastworks
and batteries on the crest of the hill
which overlooks Santiago, officers and
men falling at every step.
The troops advanced gallantly, snon
reached the foot of the hill and ascended,
driving the enemy from their works and
occupying them on the crest of the hill.
To accomplish this required courage and
determination on the part of officers and
men of a high order, and the losses were
very severe. Too much credit cannot be
given to General Summer and General
Kent Rnd their gallant .brigade com
manders. Colonel Wood and Colonel
Tarroll of the cavalry: General Hamilton
S. Hawkins, commanding the First Bri
gade, Kent's division, and Colonel Pear
son, commanding the Second Brigade.
Colonel Carroll and Major Weasels were
enabled to return and resume command.
General Wyckoff, commanding Kent s
Third Brigade, was killed at 12:10; Lieu
tenant Colonel Worth took command iind
was wounded at 12:1S; Lieutenant Colo
nel I.lpcum then took command and was
wounded at 12:20, and the command then
devolved upon Lieutenant Colonel Ewers,
Ninth Infantry.
I'juin reaching the crest I ordered
breastworks to be constructed find sent
to the rear for shovels, picks, spades and
axes. The enemy's retreat from the
ridge was precipitate, but our men were
so thoroughly exhausted that it was im
possible for them to follow. Their shoes
were soaked with \ ater by wadinp the
! San Juan River. They had become
I drenched with rain, and when they
reached the crest they were absolutely
unable to proceed further. Notwithstand
ing this condition these exhausted men
labored during the night to erect breast
works and furnished details to bury tho
dead and carry the wounded back in im
provised litters. I sent word along the
line that reinforcements would soon reneh
us and that Lawton would Join our right
and that General Bates would come up
and strengthen our left.
After reaching the crest of the ridge
General Kent sent the Thirteenth Regu
lars to assist in strengthening our right.
At midnight General Bates reported and
I placed him in a strong position on the
left of our line. General Lawton had at
tempted to join us from Caney, but when
very near our lines he was fired upon
by 'the Spaniards and turned back, but
Joined us next day at noon by a circuitous
route During all the day on July 2 the
cavalry division, Kent's division and
Bates'* brigade were engaged with the
enemy, being subjected to a fierce fire
and incurring many casualties, and later
in the day Lawton's division also became
engaged.
During the entire engagement my Btaft
performed its duty with courage, judg
ment and ability. Special credit is due to
Lieutenant Colonel J. H. DorsU Major
W A Beach. Captain Joseph E. Dick
man and Lieutenant M. F. Steel. I de
sire also to say that Lieutenants James
H Reeves and Joseph Wheeler Jr., Cap
tain William Astor Chanler, Major B. A.
Cuilngton. Aurelius Mestre and Corporal
John Lundmark also deserve high com
mendation for courage and good conduct.
Major West, my quartermaster de
â erves special commendation for his en

paign, and Major Valerey Harvard and
Leonard Wilson have also done their
full duty. Captain Hardy and First lieu
tenant P. J. Koester. with Troop G. Third
Cavalry were detailed with headquar
ters and conducted themselves hand
somely under fire. The superb courage
displayed by the officers and men will be
especially mentioned in the reports of

CUTS INTO THE EDUCATORS
WOULD NOT ALLOW CERTAIN
CHARGES.
Instructs Officials of the Board of
Education as to How They
Should Present Tueir
Claims. " â¢ â¢ *V. .
Special Dispatch to The Call. '
SAN JOSE, Aug. s.â Attorney S. F.
Leib, to whom was referred the legality
of bills of members of the County
Board of Education, rendered an opin
ion to-day that is likely to affect a
number of monthly claims presented to
the county. The opinion states that all
bills of expenses of officials must be
itemized and contain dates and names
of parties to whom paid. He holds that
members of the Board of Education
are only entitled to pay when a quorum
is present, and that part of a day shall
not be counted as a whole. He recom
mends that an expense bill filed by Su
perintendent CJjipman for $13 90 be cut
to $3 40; that fnother for $54 70 be cut
to $5 70. and that he be allowed to file
new bills without prejudice; also that
the claim of Superintendent Chipman.
for $120 for services as secretary of the
board be cut to $35, as It Is not shown
that there were any more meetings of
the board.
Bills of other members of the board
also came in for a good shaving, and
it is shown that they made the same
mistake in overcharging as Chipman.
Miss Cornelia Farley's bill is scaled
down from $110 to $60; that of H. M.
Bland from $120 to $60; Elmer Brown
ell's from $114 20 to $69 20; W. W. Pet
tit from $123 40 to $60 70.
Attorney Leib says that no services
should be paid for which the minutes
of the board do not show to have been
performed.
Superintendent Chipman claimed
that as secretary of the board he was
entitled to ?f> per day for each time
the board met, as he was obliged to
write up the minutes and attend to
other matters. The claims of other
members were for work done at home
on examination papers.
FOR
WEAK AND
WEARY MEN
There is help. There is assistance that
actually alters the state of living. Weak
men have weak backs. Weary men do not
feel inclined to work. Weak and weary
men have no such fee/ing as that of full
power or of vitality. They are at all times
forced to confess that they are unfit for the
duties of man. A man who is full of power
goes at his daily work with vim and a sense
that he can accomplish all he desires to.
The puny man never does this. He fears at
all times. He shakes. His nerves are half
gone. "Hudyan" restores nerve power.
"Hudyan" is the one thing that does. The
bright look in the eyes, the feeling of confi-
dence, the grand muscular development of
all of the organs and the sense of vigor art
produced by it. It is Nature's remedy fot
the men of weak and weary constitutions.
Circulars showing what it has done fot
20,000 people are gladly sent you abso-
ute/y free. No charge is made for medi-
cal advice either. Suppose that you have
blood taint â shown by loose teeth, falling
out of hair, thinning of eyebrows and in
other ways â why not have some good ad-
vice about it as long as it costs not a
cent ? fou could not get better help if
you paid $1000 for it.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 6, 1898.
JIM BREAKS
HIS LEFT ARM
Jeffries Unable to Carry
Out His Contract.
FIRST MEETS 808 ARMSTRONG
AND MAKES IT DECIDEDLY
WABM FOR HIM.
But by This Time the California
Heavy-Weight Is Crippled and
Unable to Face
O'Donnell.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. s.â Jim Jeffries,
the much-heralded heavy-weight pugi
list from California, was to have
fought Bob Armstrong and Steve
O'Donnell for ten rounds each before
the Lennox Athletic Club to-night, but
he was only able to carry out half of
his proposed task. He met Armstrong
and defeated him, but in doing so he
shattered his left arm and was unable
to meet O'Donnell.
This was an unfortunate thing, both
for Jeffries and the club, as the former
felt perfectly confident of defeating
both men and the managers of the club
were sorry to be compelled to disap
point their patrons.
Many shrewd Judges of boxers are
satisfied that Jeffries is a promising
and corning pugilist, and they hope that
the injury to his arm will not be seri
ous.
Armstrong went at it rather carefully
at first. There was considerable spar
ring and some blows were exchanged.
Armstrong received some hard jabs.
By the beginning of the sixth round
Bob was aware that he was up against
a stiff game and went at it according
ly. The result was that in the ninth
round Bob was weakening, but- came
up game. He jabbed left on the face
and Jeffries hooked his right on the
ribs. Jim then uppercut him with left
on face and jabbed the same glove to
the face twice. Jeffries continued this
line of attack all through the round,
and Bob did not land a blow.
Round 10â They shook hands at the
referee's bidding and Jeffries hooked
his right on the ribs. They exchanged
lefts on the face and after a great deal
of footwork Jeffries put Bob on his
back with a left swing on the heud.
Bob took eight seconds to rest, and
when he came up Jeffries hooked right
and left on the jaw. These blows dazed
Bob, but Jeffries kept pounding him,
and Armstrong ran to the ropÂ»Â»s with
out making an attempt to strike back.
It was all one-sidod n<>w. and although
Bob stayed the limit, he did so by run
ning away from the big fellow. The
referee declared Jeffries the winner,
while Armstrong's friends were telling
the colored man that he nad done Well.
Armstrong certainly stood the "gaff"
fairly well, but he was far outclassed.
Those wlii) were near the ringside
looked at Jeffries' injured hand, and It
was certainly in very bad shape.
O'Donnell entered the ring and said
that he would box Armstrong to pacify
the audience, but Armstrong had had
enough and refused to go on.

SAW A SHIP STRIKE
AN ICEBERG AND SINK
Story of a Fisherman Which Causes
Belief in a Reported Disaster in
the Straits of Belle Isle.
ST. JOHNS. N. P., Aug fÂ».â The mail
steamer Virginia Lake arrived at Tilt
Cove, on West Bay, 2T.0 miles from here,
at daylight, bringing certain corrobora
tion of the reported loss of an ocean
liner in the Straits of Belle Isle. A fish
erman at Noddy Bay reported that he
saw a steamer collide with an iceberg
and sink soon after. The report is gen
erally believed, but nothing reliable is ob
tainable. The llsherman said that the
nteamor looked like a passenger ship, and
he could see the people trying to launch
boats, but she sank before they could
do anything.
NEW YORK, Aug. s.â The Strait of
Belle Isle lies between Newfoundland and
Labrador, and is the most northern of
the two channels which connect the Gulf
n! St. Lawrence with the Atlantic Ocean.
Jt Is twelve miles wide and navigation in
it is reputed to be unsafe. It is not
the route taken by passenger liners us-
Austin Baldwin & Co.. the New York
agents of the Allan line of steamers, said
to-day that they were sure It was not
one of their steamers which was lost.
White- they did not positively know the
route taken by their steamers, it was
known they never went by the Straits
of Belle Isle. The only other Montreal
passenger line of steamers they knew of
whs the Donaldson line. They believed
that passenger boats never went by that
route, and that It could not have been a
passenger liner, as reported.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Aug. 5.â A passenger rate
war that will affect directly every fare
in the West has been declared. Next
Monday the rate between Chicago and
St. Paul and Minneapolis will be $8. The
tariff now is $11 50. On the same day
and thereafter the rate between Chi

the fight. Other lines have declared
their intention of following Its lead.
Blame for the necessity for these re
ductions is placed by the Chicago, Mil
waukee and St. Paul upon the Cana

and St. Paul declares in its notice,
brought about a war of rates to Alas
kan points. The application of these
low ratesâ about 60 per cent below au

that brokers have had no difficulty in
Belling tickets for either St. Paul or
Minneapolis for $8 find $8 50. The same
rates have been made by the brokers
for weeks from St. Paul to Chicago.
The reductions made will affect not
only St. Paul, Omaha and Kansas City

Miss Van Ness Tells Why She

' :mW Violet Van Ness, the beautiful
; young- woman whoso love for a soldier

"Thursday evening,, as was told exclu

â¢last evening as she told of fh>e reasons
that led her to her rash act.
â  : "lf I had only been able to get the

sion she looked at her interviewer with
â  a questioning look and then remarked
that although she was able to speak
five different languages the "good old
â¢American word" expressed her feel
ingl^:
â  â¢I then picked .up my pistol, which
aV;;s iving near by, and without a mo
â nle-nVs hesitation shot myself. I did
'not -feel .the pain and was perfectly

Y: : >t, don't want the idea to go forth
â¢that Mr. Potter deserted me when I
: . : flred the shot, because he did not. He
â was- 'at the University Club, and as
VoW as he heard I was hurt he came
â¢lb ray bedside. We are still the best
ef": friends, even though we did have
â  a- sli.ght quarrel the day before.

' â¢ As she said this her eyes wandered
over to her bureau where two large
bunches of red and lavender sweet
pesyj lay. Thinking that they were
from her absent hero she was asked
â¢whether he Bent them, but she
â¢â¢naively declined to say. .'. â¢
During her conversation her colored
.maid brushed her hair away from her
brow, rubbed her hands with alcohol,
and in fact treated the wounded woman
as if she were a child. Her ministra
, tions disclosed a bright little butterfly
tattooed Â«in her snowy arm, and a
/deverly. executed stalk between her
thumb and Index linger. Miss Van Ness
sÂ£.:d tie- -!â â¢ placed there during her
stay in Japan.
"I met Mr. Potter in the East during

he "arrived with his regiment he called
'to c.cc me. we .were the best of friends
everyone was about enjoying the bright
" ar>;d" I quarreled. I suppose I was brood
zing over it, and the least thing made
me angry. I went out the next day,
.. and 'Was hatipy because I ' thought
everything was made up. On my re
turn to" my apartments I threw 'aside
i>ry wraps and put on my robe de nuit.
: 'and then tried to ring him up at his

per, I said, 'd* â Ma.' and then shot my
â ; self. I am now sorry I did it," and with
a smile,' â "rirne-7er-do.it again." â¢
'â¢ Miss Van NeSs thought it sufficient
punishment to be coopeu Lt iv her
apartments, unable to move, while
everyone was about enjoying the bright
sunshine.
The young lady did not appear to
have such a hard lot to bear, as ?he
was surrounded with every sign of lux
ury. About her boudoir were downy
couches and beautiful and expensive
pouvenirs of her travels, while in an
adjoining: apartment her wallswere cov
ered with tapestries, paintings, knives
and tasty knick knacks gathered dur
ing her stay in India, China and Japan.
Miss Van Ness is slowly recuperating
from her self-inflicted wound, and will
probably be able to sit up in a few
days.
Corporal Potter of Company A. First
New York Volunteers, comes from one
of the most prominent families of. the
metropolis. He is the son of the late
F. Brownson Potter, who was a promi
nent New York banker and a nephew
of Bishop Potter. Owing to his procliv
ities for playing star parts along the
tenderloin and at the seaside of Greater
New York he has had innumerable rows
with his relativ.-s. As soon as the war
broke out he derided to enlist, and
owing to the large number of his per
sonal friends in the separate Siate
companies of which the First New
York Regiment is composed he enlisted
as a member of the Albany Battalion,
of which Major Robert Emmet is in
command.
As soon as the samp was broken at
Hempstead this battalion was ordered
to do- garrison duty at Fort Wads
worth. While stationed at this post
Potter amused himself by getting into
all sorts of difficulties with his super
ior officers and causing no end of
trouble to the people running the cafes
and places of amusement at the neigh
boring summer resorts.
In his quest for pleasure Potter was
favorable to South Beach. This place
is a sort of miniature Coney Island, lo
cated a few miles beyond the fort at
the southern end of Staten Island. Here
there is a theater, innumerable cafes
and t.-pen-air dance halls. In short it
is a midway plalsance on a limited
scale. To the heart of one of the merry
soubrettes then playing at the South
Beach theater Potter laid siege. He
had plenty of money and an unlimited
capacity lor the stimulants and other
beverages for sale at the cafes. He was
in the habit of giving nightly dinners
to the fair soubrette. At these little
affairs his fellow-soldiers were always
present.
One of the laws of the post stipulated
that all privates had to return and re
nort for duty at a certain hour each
evening. But Potter persisted in dis
regarding the regulations and finally
was placed under arrest and ordered
court-martialed. Although the pro
ceedings of the court were never offi
cially made public, it was understood
that he spent two days in the guard
house for breach of discipline. At the
time Bishop Potter refused to admit
relationship with the corporal. On his
way to this city young Potter amused
himself by buying anything his fellow
nrivates longed for. Incidentally he
Durchased the little bear which is now
the mascot of Company A. His career
in this city has been a continuance of
the performance which he held at South
Beach. A few days ago he had to be
officially reprimanded for his conduct,
and it was only through the friendship
of his superior officer for the the Pot

ter family that he was not reduced to
the ranks.
Shortly after the special train which
carried the First New York to these
shorts left Jersey City, Potter re
ceived word that he could receive the
nomination of a second lieutenantcy in
the regular army if he so desired. If
he accepted the nomination it would be
necessary for him to pass an examina
tion before his appointment would be
permanent. Upon reaching this city he
sent word home that he preferred re
maining with the First New York as a
non-commissioned officer to trying for
the straps in the regular army.
CHINESE ON STRIKE.
Refused to Ship on the Arizona for
the Wages Offered.
The Coast Seamen's Union has been ex
erting every influence to prevent the
troopship Arizona being equipped with a
crew of Chinese, but so far has met with
very little success. The Chinese, how
ever, seem to be about to solve the prob
lem for it.
Shipping Agent Callender started out
with a light heart and heavy purse to
engage a full quota of coolies to act as
waiters and fill other positions aboard the
big troopship, and after a few hours'
work marched thirty pigtailed coolies
down to the vessel. After he had got
them aboard they desired to come to
terms regarding the wages rceived. They
were offered $30, and there was a hasty
huddling together and jabbering of words
unintelligible to a civilized white man,
with enough gestures to saw the fog into
particles. The consultation ended with
the spokesman giving the verdict, "No
go; want $33," anil there they stuck.
When informed that %?,'> was too high
a figure they took up their bundles and
wenl back to Chinatown.
It is stated by persons familiar with
the conditions along the water front that
if the shipping agent chose he could flud
enough white men to llli the vessel from
stem to stern and deck to kelson, who
would be only too willing to ship for $30.
His Story a Fabrication.

ported to the police yesterday morning
that he had been held up by two foot

with a vivid imagination. Detective Ed

yesterday, and soon learned that the
young man's story was false, and that
ho was afflicted with a dream brought on
by an overdose ot stimulants. Naville

TOM TRACEY
WON THE FIGHT
He Downed McConnell
With a Hard Blow.
SEVENTEEN CLEVER ROUNDS
A RIGHT SWING SETTLED THE
LOCAL CHAMPION.
Tye of Oakland Tools the Measure of
Jacobs, the "Midget Sandow,"
After a Bloody-
Battle.
Frank McConnell, the clever and game
young California pugilist, experienced
last evening for the first time the effect
of a knockout blow. The man who upset
all of McConnoll's fondest anticipations
is Tom Tracey, a fistic artist, a native of
Australia. The place where the great lo
cal event in pugilism took place was the ]
Olympic Club, and its members and those j
who planked up the small sum of $2 wit
nessed seventeen rounds of as pretty
sparring and clever punching as the most
ardent lover of the sport could wish to
see.
In an article on the fight which ap
peared In The Call of yesterday sound ad
vice was given to the sports who were
betting large sums of money on McCon
nell at the ridiculous odds of $10 to $G, i
which subsequently went down as low as j
$10 to $5, with Tracey on the short end.
The betting was so false that not a few
of the knowing sports did not hesitate |
to say there was something doing
among those who had influence and were
in a position to resort to hipprodroming.
But the light dispelled all thoughts of i
fraud, and proved beyond question thai j
McConnell, the tyro professional, had met
his match in Tracey.
The pugilists weighed in yesterday af
ternoon at 3 o'clock at 145 pounds, but by
the time the local lad stepped Into the
ring he must have taken on a few pounds.
It was 9:80 o'clock, after the preliminary
bout between Tye and Jacobs had ended,
in which Jacobs received his quietus in
the seventh round, that the stars of the
evening shone forth.
McConnell and his attendants, Alex
Greggains. Martin Murphy and Frank
Schuler, first entered- the ring. They were
quickly followed by smiling Tom Tracey
and his bodyguard, consisting of Al
Smith, Jack Stelzner and De Witt Van j
Court Monsieur Kennedy then made ai
few brief remarks on cigarette smoking,
after which the referee, Phil Wand, or
dered the fighters to the scratch.
It was 9:3u o'clock when the gong sound
ed and the battle was on. in the first
round McConnen. who wore a very busi
ness-like look, stepped up close to Tracey ,
and after some little fiddling, sent out his
left, which landed on the face. A second
lead was prettily stopped; then Tracey
tapped Me on the face and this was fol- j
lowed by several hot exchanges at close j
quarters. Tracey plained v not right on]
Frank's stomach and a left on the oar.
Quick return stirred up considerable ex
citement among the spectators. It vu
give and take until Tracey sent out a |
wicked left swing at McConnell's jaw, j
which fell short. The opening round was
very pretty and everybody predicted a
very fine contest.
In the second round the fighters, who
had now warmed up to the heat Of battle.
went right at it, hammer and tongs, and
it looked as though a knockout might re
sult at any moment.' Trac-^ fiddled up
and around his opponent like a cooper
around a barrel, and then fiddling in me
bope of drawing out McConnoll's fire, he
shot out his left at McConnell's face and
as quick as a Hash the right followed,
landing hard on the ribs.
McConnell was not there for fun, and
soon let go his battery, and a hot rally
followed, both men landing lefts and
rights on body and face. Just before the
gong sounded McConnell caught Tracy
a hard right on the ear, and In return he
received a .short-arm right in the stom
acn, the sound of which could be heard
twenty yards from the ring. It was a
great fight so far, and honors were about
evenly divided.
Another exciting round followed when
the gong called the fighters to their feet.
Tracey Jumpeuâ or, rather, slidâ around
the ring like- a dnncing master, fiddling
with his gloves and executing qulcK
moves, by which ho hoped to demoralize
his opponent; but McConnell was as cool
as a cucumber, and moving up to within
range of the Australian he led with tnc
left, but the blow was very neatly
blocked. In fact, Tracey is considered
one of the best defensive fighters of tne
day. Tracey tried a mix-up, and as quiok
as a fla-sh he landed two lefts on McCon
nell's mouth; but for this he received a
right under the left arm which made him
wince. Again the fighter* got to mixing
it up, but the honors were about even.
After a rally McConnell made a. des
perate attempt to swing on Tracey's jaw,
but the agile Thomas slid to one side and
caught his opponent in the neck as he was
passing. The blow slightly staggered
McConnell and then the spectators realiz
ed what a quick man the Australian is.
Like a cat he sprang at his quarry and
sending out right and left at head and
body. Tom clinched and wrestled McCon
nell to the ropes, where again Tracey
landed twice on the body. This was
Tracey's round beyond nny question.
McConnell scored a pretty good lend in
the fourth round. The ball opened with
a hot exchange in which both landed on,
face and body. Tracy swung his left
hard at the jaw and missed. McConnell
took quick advantage of the opening and
landed a hard right on Tracey's ear,
which brought the receiver to his senses.
McConnell followed up his game in the
hope of landing his right again, but
Tracey was too tricky and shot around
the ring and away from danger. Hard
lighting ended the round but iYlcConhell
bad the best of the rally.
In tne fifth McConnell changed his tac
tics and resorted to left hand jabbing,
landing occasionally, but generally the
blows were well blocked. Tracey was a
bit pumped, and he did not resort to too
much fighting. He rested up.
The pugilists, having had five hard
rounds, slowed down in their dash arid
resorted to cunning tactics. Jabbing and
body punching was the order up to the
eighth round, when Tracey tried again to
steal a march on McConnell, and essayed
a knockout. It was a right at the Jaw,
but the blow landed too far back to bring
the desired , results McConnell was now
angry, and rushed Tracey to the ropes,
where he (McConnell) tried to land his
right but his man was too foxy and
Bidled away from punishment.
In the ninth there was some hard fight-
Ing at clone quarters, and both men re
turned from two hot rallies with bloody
mouths.
In the tenth round Tracey again swung
his left for the jaw, the blow whizzing
past McConnell's chin and sending Tra
cey sprawling on his hands, the Impetus
was' so great. MeConni'll dashed at
Tracey as the latter regained his pins,
and as pretty a bit of in-fighting as any
person could wisn to see resulted. It
was give and take, but the local man
seemed to have had the better of the ar-
Nothing of any particular note hap
pened until the fifteenth round, when Mc-
Donnell landed a smashing right on
Trarey's nose, driving the receiver's
head back on his shoulders The Aus
tralian was now very wild, and he dashed
at McConncll, shooting out right and lift
t head and body. The local man was,
however c(|u.al to the occasion, and re
turned blow for blow, but he couM act
land a right with any effect on Tracey,
the artful dodger.
In the sixteenth round during a re
markably savage rally, McConnell cut
open Tracey's left eyebrow and the blood
blinded the Australian. Again MoConnell
landed on the eye and Tracey was evi
dently going as he received a smash in
the Jaw which dazed him but the Aus
tralian was too old a bird to be caught
l,v a youngster in the profession, and he
clinched and held on until the gong
saved him from what might have been
a When the seventeenth round was called
everybody expected to see McConnell
finish the job." but Tracey had recovered
and was fighting strong. After a few
exchanges McConnell backed toward hia
corner, followed by Tracey, who was fid
dling like a jack-in-the-box in front of
the Californian. Finally McConnell sent
out a short left lead. This was just what
Tracey wanted, for as quick as a flash he
flung his right at the objective point and
the glove at last landed on McConnell a
jaw. McConnell fell to the carpet and
was unable to rise until counted out.
The fight is one of. If not the best, from
a scientific point of view, that has ever
taken place in this city.
The preliminary event of the night was
a 10-round bout between Morris Jacobs
of St. Louis, whose marvelous muscular
development has earned him the title of
the "Midget Sandow." and Charles Tye of
the Reliance Club, Oakland.
Tye weighed in at 135 pounds and Ja
cobs the same. The contestants agraed
not to hit in clinches.
Tye showed the most cleverness â¢rom
the start, Jacobs' blows being ill w Id
swings. Tye landed several good straight
lefts and proved himself the best ring
general. .
Jacobs landed one good blow In the
second round, a hard left swing in tne
stomach. Tye contented himself with
jabbing his opponent's face with his loft.
There was some fast fighting in the
third, and both men were nearly uut.
First Tye had the best of it, but Jacobs
superior strength stood him in good stead
and he rallied toward the end.
The fourth was an exciting round, lye
landed a corker on the jaw and Jacobs
went down for nine seconds, and then
staggered to his feet and fought back
hard to the end of the round, though
badly fatigued.
The next round was slower. Tye .nnaea
his left continually on Jacobs' orulsed
face and the latter tried a number of in
effectual swings.
Jacobs' great gameness and recuperative
powers kept him up through the sixth
round, Tye landing on his bloody face at
will without a return, but the Oaklander
did not have the strength to put htm out.
From sheer exhaustion, and suffering
from the many hard blows he had receiv
ed Jacobs succumbed in the seventh
round and going to the floor from a left
on the law, was counted out. Tye was
loudly applauded for his victory and
Jacobs for his gameness.

San Juan Returns to Santiago From
Manzanillo With Women
and Children.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 5, 2:25
p m.â The steamer San Juan, -which
went to Manzanillo under a flap of
truce to bring: here the families of the
Spanish officers who reinforced Lin
ares In Santiago before the capitula
tion, returned this morning, bringing
thirty-five persons, the wives and chil
dren of the officers who came with Gen
eral Escarios.
Originally it was said that there were
seventy-five persons to be brought, but
General Toral sVnt two officers to see
that only the "lesrally married wives"
came, whi^h reduced the number to
thirty-eight.
The San Juan was piloted into Man
zanillo by the Hist, under a flag of
truce. The Hist's commander found
everything peaceful and no complaint
of hunger. The Spanish steamer Puris
ima Concepcion, which was destroyed
there on July 18. had, it appears, landed
half her cargo at that time.
This morning General Shafter ap
pointed a special board to inspect the
men prior to embarkation. The board
consists of Major Wood, chief surgeon
of the First Division; Major Kilbourne,
chief surgeon of the Second Division,
and Dr. Gonzales, army surgeon. The

Movement at Vallejo to Organize a

VALLEJO. Aug. 5.â Preliminary step?
for the organization of a corporation to
develop the petroleum belt a few miles
north of here were taken to-day. F. de
Miranda, the representative of the Peru
vian Oil Company and an expert of world
wide reputation, has examined the loca
tion and gives his opinion that there is a
vast amount of petroleum easily accessi
ble on the ranches in the belt, which ex
tends from the tules adjoining Napa
Creek char into Benlcia Township. A
committee of prominent land owners,
composed of John Hrownlie. John Wilson
and Hon. J. J. Luchsinger. was named to
see all land owners interested and Â«ecure
their rights in the mineral claims, under
which the petroleum will be worked. If
the project i? successful there is every
evidence that Vallejo will become a large
manufacturing center.

A MAN UP A TREE.
Charles Pettijohn, an Aged Lunatic, Builds
a Fort and Seeks Refuge From
Imaginary Enemies,
Believing that he was pursued by enemies who desired to rob him, Chas. (
Pettijohn, aged 61 years, living at 1017 Florida street, took up his station in. (
a large gum tree on his property yesterday morning and with a pistol in {
each hand informed all who approached that he was determined to defend <
his property even at the expense of life. V. K. Templeton, a milkman, who <
passed the place about 5 o'clock in the morning, saw that the man was in- t
sane and notified the police at -he Seventeenth-Street Station.
Officers Charles Brown, John Edner and E. F. Bode were detailed on <
the case, and when they went to Pettijohn's home they found him still in <
the tree and were warned that they had better keep their distance. By â :
means of coaxing the officers finally persuaded the demented man to come t
out of his tree and enter the house, where they surrounded and disarmed (
him. He was charged with insanity and his case, which came up before !
the commissioners yesterday, resulted in his being sent to Agnews.
Pettijohn, who was formerly a fine mechanic, received a blow on the (
head with a mallet some years ago and has never been right mentally (
since that time. Four years ago he was taken before the insanity com- (
mission, but was discharged. The neighbors have known that he was not (
possessed of his right mind, but until recently have considered him harm- !
less â  (
A short time ago the idea seized him that some one was trying to <
rob him. He told friends that he had applied to the authorities for protec- i
tion and as he had been refused he was determined to take the matter
into' his own hands. He procured a long piece of steel, tied it to a rope, (
and would pound this with a hammer to let his neighbors know when the i
burglars, the creatures of his own mind, were about to attack him. The i
next move was to build a fort in the tree in which he was found yesterday.
This tree is about 100 feet high, and on two branches about eighty feet
from the ground he erected a platform, where he has spent most of his
time for the past few weeks. A ten-foot ladder leads from the foot of the
tree up to the first branches and from there up to the primitive fortress
cleats are nailed, which made his ascent to the platform possible.

PROMPT ACTION ORDERED
THE LONG DISUSED COALING
STATION NOW NEEDED.
On the arrival of the Mariposa last week
The Call was the only paper to chronicle
the Important news she brought from Sa
moa. The : Germans, evidently deeming
that the Spanish-American war was their
opportunity, have been carrying matters
with a high hand. Despite all the clauses
of the Berlin treaty, which gives the
United States. Germany, and -England
joint control over the group, ( the German

powers for redress. â¢..,, :;*:â¢ ......^
The effect of this piece of . news i at

A P resident of San Francisco, who re
cently visited ' Pago-Pago. '"describes ? the
harbor as one of the most remarkable in
fhc Southern Pacific. ; It is really a fiord,
or deep indentation : in:. the land, nearly
cutting the small island of Tutuila in two.
It has deep water anchorage sufficient; to
accommodate the whole United -States
navy for it runs back, some three miles.
There is good anchorage all the way, in
from thirty to ; forty , fathoms, > though, as
the wind blows very strongly through this
gorge s sound ground tackle | Is . necessary.
The shores of the bay are very steep, high,
green clad. mountains tower on each side,
and around the, tops" of/these peaks the
trade winds rage in a continuous storm.
It always blows and nearly always rains
in Pago-Pago harbor. \ Squalls are of al
most hourly occurrence. ,/Btit there is no
danger from. these minor climatic disturb
ances as the -harbor Â»-i& securely " land
locked. â  The , huge rollers ?of the Pacific
break with tremendous force upon " the
coral reefs which guard the entrance, but
they cannot penetrate far.
At Goat Isiand, a mile from the ocean,
the channel takes a sudden turn and the
rest of the harbor is completely land
locked. - â 
| Just within this island, on a sandy spot,
is all that remains of the United States
coaling ( station, which j it-is now proposed
to reconstruct. A native village, brown
huts peeping- out amidst the palm trees
and banana plantations, is close by, but
the fifteen acres of land belonging to Un
cle Sam are bare and desolate. : A few old
lighters lie, rotting on the beach; decay
ing stumps of piles indicate where there
was l once . a wharf. Owing to , the steep
ness' Of the "mountain's : which, â¢ surround
Pago-Pago, very little land is available
round the beach. The natives themselves
are terribly cramped for level areas on
which to place their huts. They will not
live away from the water, consequently
every inch of level ground around the
shores of the bay is occupied by theaÂ«
Samoans. .â -â¢â¢â " : â  .â¢' - ââ â â â -â  â¢â 
.Therefore, the land owned, if not occu
pied by this nation, has considerable in
trinsic worth, apart altogether' from Its
strategic value. It. would be difficult, In
deed, tor any other nation, to acquire; on
this harbor, such a suitable .place for a.
coaling station. The site is the pick oÂ£
the bay. . .
At last, as learned from "Washington,
it is proposed to erect a suitable wharf,
with modern' appliances for coaling. There
are no difficulties in the way. The water
is always smooth and the shore. reef or
coral, which runs out for about fifty
yards from the beach, affords a splendid
foundation for piling. : Beyond this Is
deep water, so that once the .wharf is
carried out far enough the largest, ocean
going steamer can lay alongside end load
or discharge coal.
There is no question as to the strategic
advantage of . Pago-Pago ' as '.- a : coaling
station. In the event of a prolonged oc-.
cupation of the Philippines or -of any
complications arising with Germany or
the other European powers the -United,
States would find It of the greatest ad
vantage to have a station in the South
ern Pacific, where her ships could . repair
to refit or to obtain that great essential
of modern naval warfareâ Though
late in the day,- President MeKinley has
at last recognized this fact.
In point of distance Pago-Pago Is as far
from Honolulu as . that | port is - frpm San
Francisco. It forms a sort of midway
halting place between San Francisco' and
Australia, being 2300 miles from Sydney.
2263 miles from Honolulu* and 4100" from
San Francisco: It is also nearly equally
placed with regard to the Philippines,
being 4000 miles from Manila. -
It is, however, the prospect of the near
construction of the Nicaragua canal
which gives the Samoan harbor its pros
pective strategic; value, i When the. isth
mian canal is opened the great volume of
American maritime trade will undoubt
edly follow this route across the Pacific.
A vessel -sailing from Panama will' have
8000 miles of water to cross before reach
ins Australia, and the only American
station vessels of- this nationality . will
find en route is Paso Pago harbor. Of
British, French " and ; German Isles there
are . plenty, but the United States ship
has only this one national port of refuge.
The United States Consuls in ..-Samoa
have not been slow to recognize the great
importance- of â¢ Pago-Pago, ' and : - two or
three ' years -ago Mr. Mulligan, a i'ormer
Consul General, made a very strong. pro
test to Washington on the subject. He
wrote: ; â  â ';â¢-.-. â â )â¢. ':'â 'â 
So far as concerns the United -States the en

be permissibly termed the humane Interest of
the American public hi the rights and welfare
of the Samoans. Whatever value, from a na
val point of view, Samoa possessed when the
treaty of Washington was formulated, that
importance has since been ;, lnfcrease'dr many
times over. The apparently certain construc

NAMING THE BATTLESHIPS.
WHEN Congress provided for the construction
of three new battleships it was virtually de
cided that their names should be Maine, Ohio
bnd Missouri.. Events that have occurred since that
time have led to suggestions in the East that the
names be reconsidered, and it is possible the sug
gestions may be carried out. The proposed vessels
are at present known to the Navy Department as
battleships Nos. 10, n and 12. No difficulty would
be experienced, therefore, in making a change in the
names that are to be finally given them.
The causes for the suggested changes are two. In
the first place the excellent records achieved during
the war by the Oiympia, Oregon, Charleston, Mon
terey and Other war vessels constructed in California
shipyards have led to an almost universal agreement
that the State should be honored by having one of
the new battleships constructed at her shipyards and
called by her name. In the second place, the an
nouncement that it will be possible to raise and re
pair in full strength the flagship of Cervera's squad
ron has given rise to a desire that she should be in
our iieet named the Maine,- there being a sort of
poetic justice in exacting from the Spaniard another
Maine to replace the one destroyed at Havana.
Each of these reasons for revising the names pro
posed for the new battleships is good, and taken to
gether they constitute an almost unanswerable ar
gument for adopting that course. If it should so
happen that rhe construction of none of the three
new vessels should be awarded to California builders
we would willingly forego all claims to have any of
them nanu-d after the State, for when we have a Cal
ifornia in the fleet we wish her to represent the work
rinnÂ«hip of our ftuildefs. We wish her to be Cali
forniar. hi every respect. But if, as is probable, one
of the ships is to be constructed here, then it wi! he
only right and fair that she should be named for the
State whose excellence in the building of warships
ha? been so brilliantly demonstrated both in the.
Orient, and in the West Indies.
The claim of California in this respect should be
penitently urged at Washington. A considerable
number of our Eastern exchanges are favorable to
the claim, and they of course represent a large meas
ure of public opinion in that section. We have,
therefore, a good body of friends to start with in
making the fight for the State. The lead and the
greater part of the work in the movement will, how
ever, devolve upon us. If we do not act we cannot
expect our Eastern supporters to do so.
By the State authorities, by Boards of Trade,
Chambers of Commerce and other organized bodies
of influential men the attention of the officials at
Washington should be directed to the matter at once.
Let us give to the captured Spanish flagship the
name Maine in perpetual remembrance of victory,
and of the three new battleships let whichever one is
constructed on this coast bear the name California.
As a matter of curiosity, not untinged by a desire
for justice, we would like to know whom Chief Lees
has now in his justly celebrated tanks, what the gen
tleman is there for and how long the Chief proposes
to keep him. If there is no basis for the rumor that
groans were" heard proceeding from the dank region
where the Chief immures the suspected, the Chief
ought to say so. Perhaps the place is haunted by the
spirits of those who have been thrown in so as to be
mellowed to the confession point. Anyhow, the tanks
are not popular, and the Chief ought to abolish them
and find some other method of amusing himself.
Now that some peddlers have been arrested for hav
ing possession of army uniforms wonder arises as to
what they ever expected to do with them. Perhaps
they have a contract for the garbing of scarecrows.
Unless this is the ease, they can easily establish a
plea of insanity.
When the Pacific Ocean presumed to swamp a
canoe containing Colonel Smith and Captain Kelleher
of- the -First California it was trifling with the dignity
of the army and a great commonwealth.
Yauco, Porto Rico, United States of America. This
is a new style of address, but it does riot appear to
constitute a violent assault upon the constitution.
Carlists by inaugurating a revolution just now will
win no admiration. The tendency to kick one who is
down is not indicative of lovable traits.
While Camara's squadron is announced as being
helpless, it still has the peculiar advantage of not
being a submarine affair.
At rheprospect of a clash between General Merritt
and Aguinaldo there is an involuntary feeling of pity
for Aguinaldo.
Victory seems to be fooking around for American
banners upon which to perch, but Blanco's jawbone
is still .hostile.
Dr. Pardee is said to have no confidence in his
friends. Such U the sort of feeling which easily be-
ABOUT PARTY POLICY.
T~) ECAUSE The Call has mentioned the Sen-
Y\ atorial candidacy of Mr. Bulla we are asked if
A â * he is The Call's candidate. To this we answer
for this case and for all that may arise that he is
not, and that The Call has no candidate for any
office. >
A proper view of party policy requires fair treat
ment for all sections of the State. The teeming com
munities of Southern California have great Federal
interests.
Until 1882 the Governor was always from north of
the Tehachapi. Until the election of Senator White
both Senators had always been from the same sec
tion. As the population of the south increased its
Republican majority swelled also. Great commercial
interests were planted there, and immense industrial
development has taken piace. That section has su
preme interests that depend upon proper attention
at Washington. If the voice of their press represent
thefr aspiration, it is for Senator. The same press
m a spirit of fairness has conceded the Governor to
the north. This spirit should be met in kind.
It is for this reason that The Call has supported
the views of Southern California, which should also
be the views of Northern California, if we are to
have that peace in the party which is the fruit of
natural politics and good understanding. Mr. Bulla
has been mentioned in these columns simply as a
symptom of that feeling in his section. There are
uther candidates there, worthy men all. Their proper
course is to work for party success, for the election
of an untrammeled Republican Legislature, and sub
mit to it the claim that may be justified by their
merit and their service. The Call has no choice be
tween them.
PThe political situation in this State presents a
eat opportunity to the Republican party. The
flagrant practice of unjustifiable artifice by the Dem
ocratic bosses has made it impossible for that party
to present a battle front in the coming campaign.
Upon the Republican party is the responsibility of
giving to the State a government becoming to its
dignity and suited to the high aspiration of its peo
ple. The opportunity offered to the party is, of
course, attractive to the party hack and harpy who
will take advantage of it, if permitted, to serve low
ends and personal greeds and grudges. But the party
has in it the controlling influence of men of clear
sight, of patriotic impulse, of intelligent knowledge
of the wishes and interests of the people. To them
the political opportunity, now disclosed, is presented
as a party emergency. A great duty has come in
sight. They desire to discharge it with greatness.
They wish that the sound principles of the party shall
be represented on the ticket by its highest personal
character. The people have learned by many a hard
lesson that party principles and personal character
must be joined to secure good government. The
party, if left its free way. with no momentum save
the wish and intent of the best character in it, will
present its principles for indorsement at the polls in
the keeping of its best men. Perhaps they may be
men whose names are not now on the bill boards,
who are not out in top voice shouting their own
merits and declaiming of the demerits of others.
Perhaps they are men who cherish no personal am
bition for office, who shrink from a candidature for
a nomination, and who would accept leadership sad
dened by the sense of the responsibility it carries.
Whoever they may be. The Call has faith that their
preferment will have been deserved and their suc
cess an assurance of stability, dignity and decency
in the State administration. Feeling sure that a
dignified outcome is certain in the convention, The
Call will continue to press the overmastering neces
sity of such outcome upon the masses of the party.
but it has no candidate to urge upon their atten
tion.
If this view be taken by the party press, crystal
lized into policy by the State convention, it will do
such justice to all parts of the State that contentment
with the result will bring into the working field all
men of merit everywhere, and at the polls respect for
the ticket will attract the votes of independent men,
to whom the State's honor is higher than party ad
vantage.
THE WAR OND THE REGULARS.
Y~) EFORE the country begins to give more atten-
Dtion to the proceedings of diplomatists and
statesmen arranging terms of peace than to
the actions of the soldiers and seamen prosecuting
the war it is but right and fair that due credit and
honor should be given to the part played in the con
flict by the men of the regular army. They have
been to some extent overlooked thus far, and the
average citizen reading daily of the deeds of the vol
unteers has probably hardly been aware that the reg
ulars all along have been doing their share of the
fighting.
It was natural and inevitable that the volunteers
should receive a far larger share of fame and praise
than the regulars, though both were engaged in the
same work and performed it with equal fidelity and
distinction. This was due to the State pride innate
in the citizens of every commonwealth in the Union.
As soon as the call for volunteers was issued the
States began to vie with one another to see which
would the soonest and most effectively fill the quota
allotted to it. That fact led the newspapers to de
vote a large amount of space every day to the organ
ization of the volunteer army. Next as the troops
were sent to the front State pride again compelled
the press to give conspicuous notice to whatever was
accomplished by any regiment that represented the
State in which the paper was published. In that
way it came about that from the beginning of the
war the deeds of the volunteers have been trumpeted
through the Union almost to the exclusion of any
record of the service of the regulars.
The praise bestowed upon the volunteer regiments
has not been greater than they deserved, but when
one is praised and another equally deserving is neg
lected an injustice is done. In the present case the
injustice has not been of an injurious character, but
none the less it should be corrected. The men of
the regular army are not associated with State pride,
the selection of their officers is not a matter that
rouses local interest, their valor in the field reflects
glory upon no particular commonwealth, and they
are not objects of special interest to any community.
They have no following of zealous friends, admirers
and partisans to shout applause for everything they
accomplish. If they are Jo receive their due credit
therefore it must come from all parts of the Union
and be given with the ardor of a national patriotism
unaffected by any trace whatever of local feeling.
The volunteers have done well, but the regulars,
after all, have done most of the fighting. They
formed the backbone of the army that fought its way
through the chaparral to Santiago and drove the
Spanish foe from ambuscades and entrenchments.
Some of them are now marching with Miles in his
picnic parade in Porto Rico, and others will be with
Merritt when the struggle begins at Manila. They
do not represent California or Georgia or Maine, but
none-the less they,- are our boys as -truly. -as are -those;
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 6, 1898.
who carry State names on their banners. They arc
the nation's own, and in the nation's name let their
merit be recognized and proclaimed.
A PRECEDENT deserving the attention of
loyal Republicans in all parts erf the State and
worthy of being generally followed has been
established by the action of the Good Government
Club in Santa Clara County in preparing at once to
bring out the full vote of the rank and file of the
party at the approaching primaries in order to over
throw boss rule and maintain the purity and fairness
of honest politics.
Few counties in the State have been so completely
subjected to the domination of bosses as Santa Clara,
and in most of them, therefore, no such strong in
centive to action exists as among Republicans there;
but none the less all Republicans throughout Cali
fornia will find it of advantage to be on the alert at
the primaries. The bosses will make a fight every
where. They will not only try to carry their own
counties, but will reach out for delegates elsewhere,
and wherever the rank and tile of the party are found
off their guard it is more than likely the bosses and
their allies among the corrupting corporations of
the State will procure the election to the State, dis
trict; or county conventions of men subservient to
them and adverse to the welfare of true Repub
licanism.
It is becoming more evident every day that the
chief issue in the coming campaign is to be that of
honest politics against corruption and political dis
honor. The old questions of free trade or protec
tion, free silver or sound money, were virtually de
cided at the last Presidential election, and for the
present at any rate the agitators of the policy of dis
content have subsided. New issues are to arise out
of the war and the settlement of the banking
problem, but these have not yet been formulated for
submission to the people. The time is therefore pro
pitious for the members of all parties to clean their
camps, and it is natural the people at large should
expect them to do so.
In the Democratic camp the bosses have been al
lowed their own way this far. They have managed
to get hold of the broom and are doing the sweeping
and the cleaning out. They have swept out very
nearly all Democrats of conservative views or in
dependent, self-respecting manhood. The Populist
camp, moreover, has been captured and its machin
ery turned to the uses of the bosses among the Dem
ocrats. From these two organizations, therefore, the
people can expect nothing in the way of honest poli
tics or good administration. There remain? the Re
publican party. To it the independent voters and all
good citizens are looking with hope and expectation.
At the present outlook the most sanguine hopes of
a triumph of the people through the Republican or
ganization axe well founded. The State Central Com
mittee defeated the sche.mes of the bosses at the out
set, and by requiring the holding of primary elections
in all the principal counties of the State provided a
means by which the rank and file could rid them
selves of boss control and assert their own suprem
acy. To accomplish the victory, however, the people
must act. It is this fact which gives special signifi
cance and general importance to the movement un
dertaken by the Republicans of Santa Clara County.
The impulse given there toward bringing out a
full vote of all loyal Republicans at the primaries
ought to find a ready, responsiveness everywhere. If
it does, the victory for honest politics will be assured
and the State freed from %-hat Chairman Mclaughlin
described as boss rule, corruption in politics and the
domination of corporations.
THE PRESERVATION OF FORESTS.
WHILE, despite the forest fires now raging,
many people of California continue in a con
dition of indifference amounting almost to
apathy with regard to the waste of the magnificent
woods of the State, public sentiment in the East is
rapidly forming itself into a resolute determination
to protect the woodlands of that section. Evidence
of the growing interest in the subject in the older
States abounds on every hand. Whenever an op
portunity offers, the leaders in this movement for for
est preservation are prompt to advance their argu
ments, and almost invariably these are given wide
circulation and strong indorsement by the press.
An illustration of the general interest in the subject
was given at the recent meeting of the American
Paper and Pulp Association. It was pointed 'out at
the meeting that there are now upward of ijoo mills
in the United States engaged in making paper from
wood pulp, and that they consume annually about
2.000,000 cords of wood. This statement led to a
consideration of the length of time the lorests of the
country would stand the drain, and Professor Fer
non, an authority on forestry, was invited to address
the association on the subject.
The professor is reported by the Philadelphia
Record to have submitted an estimate that hardly
more than twenty years' supply of wood pulp ma
terial is to be found in the forests of the North
eastern States, and that Canada could not contribute
much to postpone the time when the supply must be
exhausted. If we, therefore, continue our present
wasteful method of dealing with our forests it will go
hard with the coming generation of Americans tb ob
tain the woods they need for their industries.
An easy remedy for the menacing evil exists if we
choose to apply it. Professor Fernon says: "Just
as the mining industry only thirty years ago was car
ried on in an empiric way, without scien
tific basis or direction, while now well edu
cated assayers and superintendents are em
ployed everywhere, so the time will come when every
owner of a forest property will have learned that there
is such a thing as forestry, which requires technical
training, and which can increase the product and
property of a forest area far beyond the unaided
efforts of nature left to itself."
For the maintenance, continuance and reproduc
tion of our forests the professor went on to say it is
not necessary that we should resort to the costly
method of planting trees by the thousand. As a proof
of this he cited the fact that the magnificent spruce
forests of Germany, which bear a burden of from
io.doo to 12.000 cubic feet when ioo years old, of
which from 60,000 to 80.000 board feet is saw timber,
with 250 to 350 trees to the acre, have mostly been se
cured, not by the planting tool, but by natural re
seeding under the guidance of nature by skilled for
esters.
The importance of this subject cannot be too often
impressed upon the people of California. It is time
for the issue- to be considered in this State as one re
quiring immediate legislation. With the experience of
the Eastern States and of Europe before us, it will be
a folly of the worst kind if we permit our noble for
ests to be wasted without making a well directed
effort to save and improve them.
Possibly Chief Lees is demanding more room in the
Hall of Justice so that he may be enabled to enlarge
the tanks wherein he incarcerates such citizens as
.do not have the boon of his-Â«steem.
A GOOD PRECEDENT.
THE WOUNDED SOLDIER.
Steady, boys, steady!
Keep your arms ready!
God only knows whom we may meet here.
Don't let me be taken;
I'd rather awaken;
To-morrow, in â no matter where
Than lie in that foul prison hole â over there.
Stoop slowly!
Speak lowly!
These rocks may have life.
Lay me down in this hollow!
We are out of the strife:
By heavens! the foeman may track me in blood;
No! No surgeon for me â he can give me no aid;
The surgeon I want is the pickaxe and spade.
What, Morris, a tear? Why, shame on ye, man!
I thought you were a hero; but since you've began
To whimper and cry like a girl in her teens,
By George! I don't know what the devil it means.
Well! well! I am rough; 'tis a very rough school,
This life of a trooper â but yet I'm no fool!
I know a brave man and a friend from a foe;
And, boys, that you love me I certainly know.
But wasn't it grand,
'When they came down the hill in sloughing and sand?
But we stood â did we not? â like immovable rock
Unheeding their shells and repelling their shock!
Did you mind the loud cry
When, as turning to fly,
Our men sprang upon them, determined to die?
Oh, wasn't it grand?
God help the poor wretches who fell in that fight,
No time was there given for prayer or for flight;
They fell by the score, in the crash hand to hand,
And they mingled their blood with the sloughing and sand.
Huzza!
Great heavens! This bullet wound gapes like a graye â
A curse on the aim of the traitorous knave!
Is there never a one of ye that knows how to pray,
Or speak for a man as his life ebbs away?
Pray!
Pray!
Our Father! Our Father! Why don't yqu proceed?
Can't you see I am dying? Great God, how I bleed!
Ebbing away! â¢
Ebbing away!
The light of the day
Is turning to gray.
Pray!
Pray!
Our Father in heaven â boys, tell me the rest,
While I stanch this hot blood from this hole in my breast
There's something about a forgiveness of sin â
Put that in! Put that in! â and then
I'll follow your words and say an amen.
Here, Morris, old fellow, get hold of my hand;
And, Wilson, my comrade â oh! wasn't it grand,
When they came down the hill like a thunder-charged cloud,
And were scattered like mist by our brave little crowd!
Where's Wilson, my comrade? Here, stoop down your head,
Can't you say a short prayer for the dying and dead?
"Christ God, who died for sinners all.
Hear Thou this suppliant wanderer's cry;
Let not c'en this sparrow fall
Unheeded by Thy gracious eye.
Throw wide the pates to let him in
And take him pleading to Thine arms;
Forgive, O Lord, this life-long sin.
And quiet all his fierce alarms."
God bless you, my comrade, for singing that hymn!
It is light to my path, when my sight has grown dim!
I am dying â bend down, till I touch you once more â
Don't forget me, old fellow â God prosper this war!
Confusion to enemies â keep hold of my hand â
And float our dear flag o'er a prosperous land!

SPANISH SOLDIERS AND SAILORSâ
B. M. W., Soledad, Cal. It Is Impossible
to say "how many Spanish soldiers were
immediately engaged in front of Santiago
against ShaftePs troops at the- time they
surrendered." for the reason that the
Spanish officers, and they are the only
ones who know, have not given out the
figures. For the same reason the ques

PITTSBURGâ A. D. 8., Camp Merritt.
City. There Is no way of ascertaining
the exact population of Pittsburgh Pa., at
this time, as there has not been a cen
sus taken since 1890. The figures at that
date were 235.617. The estimate of the
Mayor of that city on the Ist of last Jan
uary was 290,000.
A PUBLIC RESORTâ X., City. There
is so much difference of opinion as to
whether a public resort is "a nice place
to go to or not" that it becomes a matter
of individual taste. What may be nice
to one may not be nice to another. The
simplest way for you to determine the
question to your own satisfaction is to
visit the place and judge for yourself.
The admission fee to the place named in
your communication is very small and a
-iÂ«t l. Â»Ie will satisfy you as to whether
it is a nice place or not.
TO THE FRONTâ O., Lime Point, Cal.
It is impossible at this time to say if any
of the troops now at Camp Merrltt. Camp
Merriam or other points within the vlcin
ity of San Francisco will be sent to the
front. If peace should be declared as 't
seems possible that it will be in a' short
time, then there will not be so it is
thought, any occasion to send additional
troops to Manila, but if on the other
hand the authorities should decide to
send additional troops to General Merritt
then the probabilities are that all troops'
stationed here will be sent on.
INFECTED CLOTHINGâ J. F., City.
Since the publication of the answer in re
lation to infected clothing during the
Civil War, this department, in making an
| investigation in another line, discovered
that in the testimony given by T T.
Hyams before the court martial on' the
29th of May, 1565, when those who were
charged with the assassination of Presi
dent Lincoln were on trial, he declared
that there had been a conspiracy to bring
, pestilence into the Unittd States, and that
, one Dr. Blackburn of Toronto, Canada,
I in 1863 made offers to him of a stated
I sum of money, in consideration of which
| he was to take to the United States cer
; tain clothing infected with yellow fever
i and smallpox germs, and distribute the
same, so that an epidemic would be
spread among the people of the North.
A LONG WALK-A. A. G., City. The
distance from Powell and Washington
streets, along Powell to California, out
that atreet to Fifth avenue, to McAllister
street, across Golden Gate Park to near
the Olympic ground, thence along the
road to Dewey (Balboa) avenue, out the
avenue to Ingleside, then along the road
to the beach, then along the great high
way to the cliff and from there to the ter
minus of the Sacramento street line gfcid
from there along the track of that line
to the point of commencement is 98,600
feet or a little in excess of eighteen and
one-half miles. A young lady who walked
that distance in six and a quarter hours
performed a good feat of pedestri<ir.i.s-n.
in view of the fact that it was about three
miles an hour, and the further fact that
the average man, when not sprinti'itf.
walks at the rate of three miles an hour
or four feet per second.

NEXT MANILA EXPEDITION.
Seventh California Regiment, Two Battalions of
Regulars and Nine Hundred Recruits
Will Comprise the Brigade.
The detail of the next expedition for the Philippines Is now officially
stated in a letter received yesterday by Brigadier General Miller from Ma
jor General Verriam, commander of the Department of California. The
letter does not treat of expeditionary matters directly, but in its text
makes allusion corroborative of the matter that has already appeared in
the columns of The Call.
Following is a copy, verbatim, of the communication received by Gen
eral Miller from the department commander:
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OP CALIFORNIA.
SAN FRANCISCO. Cal., Aug 4. 1898.
Commanding general. Camp Merrltt. Cal.â Sir: The department commander desires
that those troops who are to go on steamships Bcandia and Arizona, viz.: Seventh
California, battalions of Eighteenth and Twenty-third regulars and recruit detach
ments, who are supplied with tin plates Instead of meat cans, submit requisitions at
once for number of meat cans they lack for complete equipment, as the ordnance of
ficer Benicia arsenal. Is now prepared to furnish same. Very respectfully,
JOHN B. BENNETT, A. A. A. O.
These Instructions from General Merriam have caused General Miller
to radically change his plans regarding the moving of the remaining
battalion of the Eighteenth Infantry to the Presidio. On Thursday the
general had decided to move either the Eighteenth or Twenty-third to
the Presidio on Monday. He has since resolved that he will order the re
moval of none of the troops that are now assigned to the next expedition.
This will leave at Camp Merrltt the Seventh California, the two battal
ions of the Eighteenth and Twenty-third and the recruits for the Second
Oregon, First Nebraska. First Colorado and Tenth Pennsylvania regi
ments, now at the front. As was stated yesterday, General Miller will
also maintain his headquarters at Camp Merritt until the next sailing day.
In an interview yesterday Brigadier General King said that he had
fully decided to sail with the transport Arizona, which he expects will
be read* by the end of next week. General King also announced that it
is his present plan to sail just as soon as his boat is made ready, regard
less of whether the Scandia be made ready by that time or not. The Scan
dia will probably not be in Bailing shape for three or four days after the
Arizona saijs.
There is every evidence at Camp Merrltt that all expeditionary mat
ters are being hurried as much as is compatible with military thorough
ness. The tri-monthly reports of the troops scheduled to leave have been
hurried, and reports have been asked for detailing the equipment still
needed by the different detachments and daily the favored ones of other
commands are being assigned for "quarters and rations" or "temporary
duty" to either the Eighteenth or the Twenty-third. It Is evident that the
demise of Camp Merritt is not far distant.

He does not speak of hardships dur
ing the voyage, but on the contrary
Bays the trip was fine. It was his
pleasure to deliver to Admiral
Dewey the first file of papers from
the fleet of transports. He writes:
"Tell Tom Carter and Molly that I

At 2:37 p. m. a force of bluejackets from the
Charleston landed on the fortress and hoisted
the American flag amid the wildest enthusi
asm. A salute of twenty-one guns was fired
and the band played patriotic airs. A few of
our officers went ashore at the town (Spumaye)
and brought hack wonderful tales of the agri
cultural wealth of the Islanders. They were
very warmly received by the 300 nativesâ a
very simple class of people, resembling Japs
very muchâ who hailed them as their liberators
and went Into ecstacles when informed that the
Governor would not be allowed to return. They
talk less Spanish than English. having picked
up the latter from the American whalers who
frequented here some years ago.
We heard terrible tales of the brutality of the
Governor who has charge of the prison at
Agana, Guam being used a* a penal station
for the Philippines. They say he executed over
a hundred rebels some months ago.
The houses of the town are built of Iron
wood, thatched over with tropical leaves, and

AT THE SANTIAGO FRONT
Some Little Feeling Is Noted
Between the Regulars and
Volunteers.
In reading between the lines one per
ceives that there is some feeling between
the regulars and volunteers at the Santi
ago front. The over praise given to the
Seventy-first New York Regiment Uy the
weekly illustrated journals and daily
papers of New York City no doubt caused
the premature publication of General
Kent's official report, wherein it is said
that the advance battalion of the=Â£eventy
first recoiled under the fire of the enemy,
and that it required the effort of regular
staff officers to restore the alignment.
No doubt the Seventy-first New York
rendered gallant service in the battle, but
the works were not carried by the brav
ery of that command alone, as the pic
torial papers published in New York
would indicate.
Colonel Roosevelt's remarkable letter
wherein he praises the efficiency of his
own regiment rh compared with the effi
ciency of tho National Guard regiments
may be accepted as an indication that
army Jealousies exist at the front. Roose

with such articles as experience lv-B

week They expressed themselves as veiy
thankful for the attention shown, th<;>m
and declared that at this time all that
they need is reading matter.
During the coming week the relief com

where Forester soldiers will find some :>ne

JAMES ATHERTON INJURED.
Sustains a Fractured Rib in a Cable
Car Accident.
James Atherton, a man well along in the
seventies, was struck down by a Sutter
street car about half-past 3 yesterday af
ternoon on the corner of Sutter and
Kearny streets. Whether he was at
tempting to board the car or was cross
ing the street and reached for the car
to save himself when he discovered the
danger he was In is not known. He was
knocked down In front of the dummy and
was dragged a very short distance when
the car came to a full stop. A soldier
und another man came to his assistance
at once. Atherton was immediately car
ried to his room at the Russ House. Dr.
DotT, the physician of the Sutter-street
company. was called and attended the in
jured man. After a thorough examina
tion he discovered that Atherton was suf
fering from a fractured rib on his right
side. Atherton is a feeble man and the
shock of the accident may result seri
ously.
cate that his Rough Riders were brave,
but unskilled, and hence received a deal
of punishment without inflicting much
loss on the enemy. The bravery and
efficiency of the volunteer regiments of
the I'nited States have been tested and
established in many a fierce and prolonged
conflict, compared to which the fighting
at Santiago, measured by the losses re
ported, was but a brisk skirmish or pre
liminary engagement.
The regular troops at Santiago were no
doubt surprised and vexed when they re
ceived the Eastern papers which gave
the Seventy-first New York so much
credit for the achievements of the cam
paign; and so to even up the credit score,
army officers brought influence to bear to
secure an early publication of at least
one of the official reports. One, of the
New York dailies not long since pub
lished a story to the effect that a bat
talion of the Seventy-first refused to ad
vance further under the fire, but the
publication caused such a storm of in
dignation that the subject was dropped.
OFF TO HONOLULU TO-DAY
Embarkation of Five Compan
ies of New Yorkers and a
Battalion of Engineers.
At 9 o'clock yesterday morning the Third
Battalion of the Second Regiment of
United States Engineers and Companies
I. X, L, M and C of the First New York
Volunteer Infantry, assigned to Honolulu,
marched out of the Presidio, headed by
the First Washington Regimental Band,
whose services were courteously tendered
by Captain Wholley.
Major Chase was in command and rode
at the head of the column. The two
bodies of men, the engineers being in ad
vance, presented a line appearance and
were given a rousing send off by those
who remained behind.
The troops marched along the usual
route â Lombard street. Van Ness avenue.
Golden Gate- avenue and Market streetâ
to the Steuart-street wharf. They re
ceived an ovation from the crowds all
along the line, especially on Market
street.
It was not until late in the afternoon
that the embarkation was completed and
the steamers Charles Nelson and Lakmo
pulled out into the stream. They will
start for Honolulu some time this morn
ing.
A WOUNDED SOLDIER.
Did Not Know That His Re
volver Was Loaded, and Is
Now in the Hospital.
The same old story "of-dld-not-know-it-
was-loaded" was the cause of Private
Nash, Company A, First New York Regl
mt-nt, receiving a painful wound yesterday
afternoon, from effects of which he Is now
suffering in the post hospital. Nash was
cleaning a revolver in his tent about 8:30
o'clock in the afternoon, according to his
statement, when in sonic way the weapon
was accidentally discharged. The ball
passed entirely through Nash's right wrlat
arid lodged in the fleshy part of his right
leg just above the knee. Major Davis sent
him at once to the post hospital and he
was taken In charge by Major Moseley.
Nash claims that he did not know the
revolver was loaded. While the wound is
a painful one it is not serious.
Army Christian Commission.
The Nelson and Lakme were yesterday
boarded by representatives of the Chris
tian Commission, who placed on each
transport a library of interesting books
and distributed other general reading
matter among the men. The Mothers'
Club of the Commission did lively work
in their mending and sewing for the boys
In getting them prepared for their long
journey. The Press Club will give an en
tertainment at the mothers' headquar
t> rs. Fifth avenue, this evening. A large
tent has been ordered for the headquar

probably next Monday. In connection
with this tent there will be a smaller one,

SOME IMPORTANT
REVENUE DECISIONS
WINE SELLEBS MUST STAMP
BOTTLES OF CUSTOMERS.
Traveling Shows Must Pay the An
nual Tax in Every State in
Which They Perform.
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch was
Informed yesterday by the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue at Washington of
several very important decisions made by
the department. They are as follow:
Clubs are required to pay the special tax for
retailing liquor but need not pay a tux on
billiard tables for their members. Church en
tertainments for the benefit of churches or for
charity where no hired prrformers take part,
anil amateur entertainments for the benellt of
churches nr for charity are not taxed. Free
Concert or variety shows where liquor is solil
must pay the tax of |I<K). Circuses or travel
lnÃ shows must pay the tax of JIOO In every
State in which they perform.
Attention is called to the fact that no ex
epption whatever Is made by the law ImpoÃlng
a tax on wines when l>ottled for sale because
of the ownership of the bottle or bottles con
taining the same, and no limit !s fixed as to
the number of bottles filled, offered for sale, or
sold, to which stamps must be affixed. The
fact that the customer brings the bottle with
him will not. therefore, relieve it from the ne
cessity of being properly stamped at the time
when filled.
All druggists, saloon keepers, growers or
Other dealers who do not usually handle case
goods, should understand that this ruling ap
plies to sales of wine by the bottle, whether
the dealer or customer provides the bottle.
I'nder schedule A of the act relating to
"mortgage or pledge," the memorandum of the
pledge of the certificates, to which reference
Is made as collateral security must be stamped,
if the debt secured exceeds $10M. The stamp
tax however, Is to be reckoned not on the face
value of the certificates of stock pledged, but
on the amount of the money loaned thereon.
A policy does not require a stamp until It 1s
issued or ofTered as an Insurance policy, and
the Insurance company can stamp a policy
through Its local agents as well as through its
general agent or head office. Any agent of the
company who is charged with the duty of de
livering the policy to the policy holder and
receiving the premium is authorized to affix
and cancel the stamp in behalf of the coin
' if the company insists that the Insured party
pay the value of the stamp. It Is not a mat
ter which the internal revenue laws can deal
with. It Is between the insurance company
and the policy holder.
A policy of insurance is not valid unless it
bears the proper canceled revenue stamp.
Section 31 of the act of June 13, 1898, pro
vides that "'all administrative, special or stamp
provisions of law. including the. laws in rela
tion to the assessment of taxes, not heretofore
specifically repealed, are hereby made appli
cable to this act."

ANXIOUS TO
ATONE FOR
HER SINS
Sad Condition of Jen
nie Moyles.
ARRESTED FOR VAGRANCY
HER MOTHEB FAINTED WHEN
TOLD OF HER DOWNFALL.
Led Astray by a Companion for
Whom the Police Are Now
Searching.
Jennie Moylefl, a prepossessing young
woma.i of 17 years, was arrested at an
early hour yesterday morning by Police
Officer McMurray and booked for some
public Institution. She was found In a
disreputable lodging-house on Fourth
street, accompanied by two soldiers.
About two weeks ago the girl disap
peared from her home at 1816 Bush street,
and her parents feared that Bhe had been
foully dealt with. Her father, who is em
ployed by the Surveyor of Customs, lost
no time In notifying Chief Lees, who de
tailed Officer McMurray to make an in
vestigation.
Shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday morn
ing the erring girl was located and taken
to the City Prison. Several hours later
the arresting officer visited the home of
her parents and informed her mother that
her miÃ3lng offspring was locked up in
the City Prison. On hearing the news of
her daughter's downfall Airs. Moyles
fainted, and it was with considerable dif
ficulty that she was revived.
"Why did she deceive me?" she moaned
after recovering consciousness. "I would
rather see her dead than to know she
was an Inmate of the City Prison."
Touched by her sorrowful appeal, Mc-
Murray left the house, after promising to
do all in his power to restore the unfor
tunate girl to her parents. \esterday
forenoon her case was called in Judge
Mogan's court, but on account of the ab
sence of several Important witnesses it
was continued until to-day.
The fair prisoner was in a penitent
mood last night, and begged to be al
lowed to go home. She declared that she
was led astray by another girl, for whom
the police are now searching.
â¢â¢I did not intend to leave mamma, she
tearfully remarked; "but this other girl,
whose name I do not know. Induced me
to go with her. We went to the Presidio
and as It was too late to return home I
foolishly consented to accompany her to
her room, where I was found.
It is likely that Judge Mogan will Issue
an order to-day restoring- the foolish girl
to her parents.

Property in His Possession.
Detectives Ryan and ODea of the
southern station last night detected an

100 automatic burners whloh they claim
were stolen by the culprit from various
! unoccupied houses. _

GILT EDGES
ARE
DISSEMBLING.
BY JOE CORBETT.
The famous and hitherto .mighty Gilt
Edge 'collection, reinforced by the acqui
sition of Hutchinson, is, to use a baseball
vernacular, "not so many." The Ath
letics, and Sand Crabs figure that way,
and while I still, respect their capacity
and ability I also" recognize the fact that
there is abundant room for conjecture as
regards the closeness of the pennant race.
â¢ .The late- performances of this team at
Recreation -Park, .in which it met with
'unquestionable defeat, ' has, if nothing
else, demonstrated one fact, and that is
that this club,, which was supposed to
have a decided walkover in the champion
ship race, will have to play ball and play
it for all it is worth to make good the
many boasts and . high reputation.
I still entertain the belief that they
will eventually win the flag, but this be
li. lias taken on a much milder form for
the ' reason that there are three clubs
playing as good ball and. which loom up
in" a great many respects as the equal of
fliis "Nicked Edge" aggregation.
To say I was disappointed in the play
of the leaders on their recent visit her
expresses my sentiments exquisitely. And
to say I was astonished at the child
ish "methods. they displayed during Sun
day's contest with the Athletics would,
I assure you. be expressing sensations
very mildly. Their play on this occasion
was miserable enough, but their, "baby
fled" tactics, a hitherto unknown quan
tity with these "old salts," did aggravate
the situation extremely. I could neve
have conceived them playing such a role,
but one defeat, quickly followed by the
possibility of another, intermingled with
the cruel* realization that there are other
good teams in the league race, might
have had its effect. It certainly did on
this occasion, and if my conjecture be
erroneous then what caused these" "old
stagers" to act like a lot of inefficient
amateurs? \.- .*,-.-. .
Their kicking in last Sunday's game
over nothing, for I* must here mention
that Stanley's throw,- which hit Payne,
was a piece of stupidity on the part of
Stanley,. should have thrown the ball
hitrner and not into the runner â is a char
acteristic which does not tend to embel
lish in any manner an already fascinating
exigency.
Payne's run, of course, placed victory
at a great distance, but this fact was no
reason for a team's dissembling. And it
was a few of the spectators who accused
them of dissembling, not I. for I cling to
the belief that this club does not relish
defeat., and, therefore, cannot stand it,
Two of the high-class greyhounds of this State, will run best two out of three courses
at the lngleside Coursing Park on Sunday afternoon for a large consideration.
â¢ hence this. continued kicking over nothing. ]
, I did not think it possible for them or con
' 6istent with their make-up to convert into I
a farce a game replete with interest for :
' no other reason than the assurance of de
feat. It is, of course, aggravating- in the
â > â¢ extreme to realize that other teams are
playing superb ball, but prudence should :
. nave -predominated when such a reality i
presented itself. The Nicked Edges (I for- '
. got to mention that some of the Gilt has â 
been taken off) must refrain from making
' a faree -out of an exciting, and Interesting
game of ball, and at the same instant do
- away with such "baby tactics" as they
; displayed on Sunday last. . They have no
. moni right to spoil a game without suffi- ;
cient cause than any other team, and if
â  â¢ they adhere to such methods it will great
â  ]y interfere. with their gingerly play, and \
- will in time disturb those championship
aspirations. â 
On form I think they will win the pen- j
. rant, but they have a much harder road
to travel than was anticipated.
If they, however, rise too high In their
own estimation and continue to kick, spoil
â¢and prolong games when there is no oc- !
. casion for it, the chances are greatly
against them, as their play Sunday dem
onstrates. The San Joses, Athletics and j
Sand Crabs are playing ball these days,
ai\d will continue to do so if they do not j
..become inflated. with the idea that they
' are the "onliest ones." This exalted idea '
of one's self has wrecked more than one j
â¢ team and while I do not wish to give the
Impression that there is a possibility of j
â¢ such a move, still, if the leaders after a I
f.ew years' experience so far forget them- \
selves, a person might conceive of their
opponents doing likewise, which would,
by the way, be an inglorious move, for It '
â¢ does not necessarily follow. Don't be '
' guilty of such unsophisticated tactics as |
â¢ those Leaders displayed on last Sunday.
â¢ Games cannot be won in that manner, and |
. then a bad impression of one's inability ]
to cheerfully take defeat naturally en- i
â  sues. .The Gilt Edges I thought Incapable i
'" oÂ£ such foolishness and > as I previous';/
mentioned, if they continue to exist and !
entertain the ideas which prompted them
to mar last Sunday's contest, they will i
' wind up in about fourth place.
To-morrow at Mill Valley that crack
".a*mateur_team known as the Clevelands
: â  will cross! ats with the club representing
â¢ the above-mentioned neighborhood for i
the benefit of the Bed Cross Society.
" ' The game, no doubt, will be' an excel- ;
â lent one, and too much praise cannot be i
â¢heaped upon these boys for their patriotic i
1 endeavors. The Cleveland team, espe- I
illy, holds an enviable reputation among
' "-the minor organizations of this city, and!
.: -contains a number of - exceedingly clever
players.
Their, victories this season have been '
niHnorous and it is hoped their attempt i
-â¢ Sunday in behalf of the Red Cross will,
meet with an overwhelming success. The'
â¢ banner crowd of the season is expected to
attend, **>^ â¢Â».â¢â¢*â  - â¢ ,-â ..-â :. â -. â¢â '

COMING EVENTS
OF THE
LOCAL WHEELMEN
The regular monthly meeting of the
i California Associated Cycling Clubs will
be held this evening at the rooms of the
i Reliance Club Wheelmen, Oakland. Most
; of the delegates will go over on the 7:30
narrow-gauge boat. Several important
! amendments to the by-laws will be con
sidered and plans matured for the asso
ciation's big annual road events next
month and in October.
At 9 a. m. sharp to-morrow the good
i ship Annie E will sail from Jackson
street wharf laden with watermelons,
'â  sandwiches, Bay City Wheelmen and
j other good things for a trip around the
â  bay. The Bay City Club makes this trip
annually and there is always a large
gathering of members, as the outing is a
j popular and enjoyable one, since Doc Mer
vy discovered his famous cure for mal de
, mer. Such old-time yachtsmen as Toep
| ke, Cook, Plummer, Steve Brode and Dr.
' Hill will guide the craft over the billowy
waves.
Local wheelmen are taking a good deal
of interest in the race meet to be held
at Stockton on August 28. The Bay City
Wheelmen and Olympic Club Wheelmen
FALSE FLATTERER AND CONNEMARA,
will be well represented In the events, i
and Peck and Wing will probably have i
another meeting 1 , which will give the lat- !
ter an opportunity to prove whether or j
not he is the better man. The San Fran
cisco rider's will go up the night before
on the river boat, leaving- at 6 o'clock, and !
return the following night.
C. ML Smith, the speedy San Jose rider, \
was in the city this week. He is preparing
for the Stockton and San JoÂ«e meets i
und hopes to Ret within the prize money. !
The San Jose meet on September 9 will :
of necessity draw a large crowd because !
of the Native Sons' celebration there on !
that day, the bicycle races being a part I
of the official programme of entertain- ;
ment. The famous three-lap cment |
track Is being put in shape, patches in a [
few places being all that is. needed to
make it as even and fast as ever. This
Is a favorite track with the riders, as it
is long and wide, and accidents on It are
few.
A. H. Agnew and J. S. Shedd wore nor- !
mated for the captaincy of the Acme
Club Wheelmen at the annual meeting
held last Monday night. Mr. Shedd is tho
incumbent and his previous successful
term of office seems likely to Insure his j
re-election.
Chester 8. Myrick has resigned as
chairman of the road racing committee
of the Associated Cycling Clubs owing
to press of business. President Adams

ity to bring me Into it by saying that
my "column, while readable, was never
more than interesting simply as Spald

JUICY CLAMS
FOR THE TARS
OF TIBURON.
Commodore Dr. T. L. Hill of the San
Francisco Yacht Club returned last Sat
urday from his trip through Yellowstone
National Park and visited the club house
on Sunday. W. S. Ooodfellow, owner of
the schooner La Paloma, who has been
for some weeks with his family at Santa
Catallna, returned to the city last Tuesday
by train from San Luis Obispo, leaving
his boat to be sailed back to her moorings
by the men in charge of her. During this
month the programme of the San Fran
ciscos is blank. The Pacifies, Corinthians
and Californias cruise to-day and to-mor
row up the bay to meet yachts returning
from trips up the river. The Enclnals
have a ladies' cruise to Baden on their
programme for to-day, but there la little
activity among the Alameda yachtsmen
this season.
In the course of some remarks at the
California club house on the occasion of
the presentation of the Wallace Trophy
to E. F. Sager of the sloop Edna, the
donor referred to the approaching demo
lition of the narrow gauge wharf. When
the railroad company extends the mole
the California Yacht Club may move its
headquarters down to the waters of the
bay and so escape the necessity of beating
out of the estuary. The founders of the
California Yacht Club proposed to make
their headquarters a rendezvous for the
yachtsmen of the bay, where yachts may
be securely moored and taken care of un
til their owners come over on the follow
ing Saturday or Sunday.
E. N. Walter, J. Laughland and Louis
McMurtrie, who have been up the river
In the sloop Embla, came down last Sat
urday to McNears Landing and returned
home next day. Carl A. Tarnberg's sloop
Hope, H. S. Pratt's yawl Idler and Vice
Commodore G. B. Edgar's sloop Sappho
are on trips up the Sacramento River.
George Miller's new sloop Occident was at
Vallejo la.st .Saturday, where the sloop
Hazel will henceforth make her head
quarters, having been bought by a resi
dent of that town. About two weeks ago
A. M. Clay of the sloop Sea Fox lost his
small boat, but. though he believes it
went ashore on Berkeley fiats and has of
fered a reward for its return, he has so
far not recovered it. Secretary G. F. Gai
ther's U & I will cruise as far as Red
Rock to-morrow to meet the boats return-
Ing from up-river cruises. The schooner
Mellva, recently purchased by Carl A.
Tarnberg and renamed The North Star,
filled with water and sank.
E. P. Sager's sloop Edna of tho Califor
nia and Corinthian Clubs, and E. C. Bart
lett's yawl Frolic, chartered this season
by Messrs. Eaton and Lowell, anchored at
McXears Landing last Saturday.
The following boats accompanied the
yachts going on up-river cruises as far as
Vallejo last Saturday: Ex-Commodore J.
W. Pew's sloop Truant, Commodore Carl
Westerfeld's sloop Aeolus, E. Ponohoe's
sloop Speedwell, and Secretary E. B. La
throp's sloop Pride, of the Corinthian
club; also George Miller's sloop Occident
of the Californlas. On the return from
Vallejo a strong wind and high sea were
encountered: the sloop Pride carried away
the clew of her Jib, and a small yacht was
noticed with a broken topmast, which car
ried with it her forward jib stay and let
down her gaff. The sloop Clara went up
the Suisun Creek.
The event of to-morrow will be the big
clambake to be given at the Corinthian
club house, the arrangements for which
were given in yesterday's Call.
TENNIS SINGLES WILL
BE PLAYED TO-DAY
That tennlÃ is picking up Is evidenced by
the number of players that turn out for
practice on the California Tennis Club
courts.
Reuben Hunt, the young Alameda
player, visited the California courts dur
ing the week, and mot both Joe Daily
and George Whitney. In a set with
Daily Hunt was victorious after a very
severe struggle.
Robert N. Whitney and George Whit
ney have been hitting away at singles
every day of the week, and Robert N.
has carried off the larger portion of vic
tories. Bradshaw, now in the Hospital
Corps of the army, met with a painful
accident on Wednesday. In the act of
returning a very fast ball he strained his
back, and it will be some time before ue
will be able to Indulge his passion for
tennis. He is now on the slck list.
This afternoon the singles tournament
will be held at the California Club courts.
The entries are: Davis, Blanchard, Mc-
Gavin Stauf, Kllgarrif, Walter, Hamil
ton. Drummond McGavin and George
Whitney. All the players will be nut on
the scratch with the exception of George
Whitney, who has been placed fifteen
behind the scratch mark. Prizes will/ be
given the winner of the tournament and
the runner-up. The drawings will be held
on the courts just before the tournament
is called, which will be at 2 o'clock.
The young lady players are" beginning
to return from the country and resume
their tennis. Last week some very in
teresting matches were played by the
junior class. A ladies' tournament will
be a feature of the near future.
Milton H. Esberg has gone Into train

RUSTY BARRELS
THINGS
OF THE PAST.
Ever since firearms, smooth bore and
rifled, were invented the greatest of cure
had to be taken of them to keep the in
side from rusting and pitting-. When the
inside of a barrel gets into a bad condition
from this cause its usefulness is sadly im
paired, as every sportsman knows. Hence
the first duty of the possessor of a fire
arm after shooting is to give the inside
of the barrel a thorough cleaning and
then a heavy coating of oil to prevent
moisture from rusting. More guns have
been ruined by neglect and carelessness
than by wearing out, breakage and even
actual loss. Leading a gun barrel is pro
duced by bad or cakfcd powder, lack of
lubrication, fouling and several other
causes. All of theso annoyances are more
liable to occur in rilled firearms than in
the smooth bores. Shooters the world
over nave laDorea and expended lots ot
gray brain matter in trie endeavor to over
come these annoyances, but in vain.
That is "In vain" until the. inventive
genius of a California man was applied to
the subject. Joseph Singer of Los Ange
les has worked out a process by which
fouling, leading, rusting and pitting- of
gun barrels can be overcome. Mr. Singer
is now at the United Stales Armory at
Springfield, Mass., where the process is
being thoroughly tested by the Govern
ment. The invention consists of a chemi
cal composition which upon being applied
to the inside of the barrel of a pistol,
rifle or shotgun makes the surface so hard
that foreign substances cannot adhere
thereto, consequently prolonging' the life
of the barrel Indefinitely.
The inventor, who made many severe
tests of his process before making known"
the fact of his discovery, declares that
after a gun has been ihus treated it can
be shot continuously without wiping or
cleaning and can be put away dirty with
out Injury to the metal, a thing that no
sportsman who values his piece would
dare to do. A shotgun thus always clean
gives better pattern and in pistols and
rifles a higher vel< !ty and deeper pene
tration. One of the large manufacturers
of shotguns In the East has testified that
lie had examined several barrels after be
ing treated by the Singer process and
found that it does away with the neces
sity of wiping, cleaning or oiling the bore,
that the surface Is so hard as to prevent
leading and that a perfect pattern was in
sured. A prominent manufacturer of
rifles and pistols In New Haven, Conn.,
stated that so far as he had been able to
test the Singer porcess of preventing rust,
etc., he could not find a single point in
which it fails to secure permanent results.
If the process proves in the long run
to be all that Is claimed for it, and so far
there is no reason to doubt that it
will, it is one of the greatest Inventions
of the age. In the first place Uncle Sam
can save hundreds of thousands of dol
lars by protecting his army and navy
muskets, which are now spoiling by the
cartload through the carelessness of sol
diers and sailors. If It will save a small
gun there Is no reason why its efficiency
on a cannon would be any the less, and
the big guns of fort and warship have to
be handled as carefully to prevent cor
rosion as the finest of machinery. There
is no telling of the possibilities of the
process and In time, the plates of war
ships and merchant vessels may be so
treated as to make expensive docking to
clean foul bottoms a thing of the past.

ALL ABOUT DOGS
AND THEIR OWNERS
Interest in dogs is certainly not on th>j
wane on this coast, if one may gauge by
the purchases recently made by local fai.
ciors.
F. H. Bushnell has bought the magni
ficent and deservedly famous bitoh, Mel
rose Sylvia, which will arrive here in
whelp to Mrs. Lee's equally famous
Prince Sylvia.
Mr. Webster Jones is another exam
ple of the "Star of Empire" gone East.
His acquisition is a line English setter
with a groat Held trial reputation.
Mr. George Bell, formerly of Toronto
and now of Menlo Park, has been laid up
with a severe attack of rheumatism, Dut
is now on the highway to recovery.
In answer to the dismissal of John
H. Sammi's charges concerning his Dull
terrier, Scaldy Mike, by the executive
board of the American Kennel Club, Mr.
Sfiipml has written to Secretary Vreden
burgh, asking for information. The ques
tions asked by Mr. Samml are:
"Did the secretary of the San Francisco
Kennel Club state officially that the bull
terrier. Scaldy Mike, was judged in the
heavyweight class in the ring, or*ils ken
nel? If he was Judged in hi* kennel
afterward, does, this come within the
rules of the American Kennel Club?
Further, If judge in latter case declined
to make any change in his prior deci
sion, why should the winning card, 'First
Prize,' be placed by the San Francisco
Kennel Club over his kennel? Kindly
enlighten me on above and oblige."
Hospital Quarters Not Too Large.
Dr. John K. Morse of the Board of
Health forwarded a communication to the

A JUBILEE WEEK
FOR THE
COURSING MEN.
This will be a jubilee week for the leash
men. The purses disbursed at the two
parks in the regularly scheduled stakes
aggregate no less than $1725, besides
which the winner of the match race be
tween Connemara and False Flatterer, at
Ingk'Side, will pull down another $750.
At Union Park the features are a stake
for non-winners, embracing seventy-two
candidates, and a twenty-four dog cham
pion stake. At Ingleside the card in
cludes a champion stake with thirty-two
performers, the usual monthly puppy
stake, with forty entries, and the match
race. The champion contests at both
parks show the best stock of the coast.
The puppy stake at Ingleside has brought
out an unusual aggregation of young
sters â unusual in number and quality.
The non-winners' event at Union Park
will puzzle the talent In almost every
course.
The match race between Connemara and
False Flatterer has excited much specu
lation locally and the result will be await
ed far beyond the local limits. Conne
mara is a coast-bred dog and is deemed
at present the peer of any native canine
on the sward. False Flatterer v.-as
brought out from England last summer,
in which country his sire (Fitz Fife) is
said to have been the king- pin of the long
tails of his day. Connemara will prob
ably rule a slight favorite, but neither
contestant will lack backing. Both were
in the pink of condition last evening. To
morrow both will probably be reported in
the most miserable shape.
The champion stake at Union Park this
week looks to be a one-round contest.
According to the knowing ones the win
ner of the course between Rosette and
Firm Friend should lift the final nag.
Massey has his eye on the Ingleside
money again to-day. Massey ran his
Eastern stock at Inglesido for the first
time May 30, since which time the string
has cost the Ingleside cashier, in stake
money, $415.
For the first time since the gates were
thrown open E. V. Sullivan has no candi
dates at Union Park this week. Right
Bower, formerly owned by Mr. Sullivan,
is running in the name of T. McEldowney.
by whom, it is said, he is to be handled
for Dr. G. W. Leake. Mr. Sullivan has
eight flyers at Ingleside.
Ray & Trant are again in the running
at Ingleside with a formidable showing.
This firm, will be trotting some rather
high-class youngsters next year. During
the past few days Sylvia has been bred to
Eclipse, Lemon to Sir Hugo, and Diana â
it is believedâ to Chit Chat. Nelly Conroy
has also been bred to Moondyne.
Vanity Fair and Koolawn should put up
a warm contest at Union Park in the
champion stake. Only a few weeks ago
Koolawn would have been deemed a
"pipe," but her showing lately has scarce
ly seemed on par with her capabilities.
The annual Produce Stake will be run
at Ingleside October 1. At a meeting of
the Ingleside Coursing Club, D. Shannon
presiding, Messrs Hugh Lynch, P. J.
lii illy and J. Smith were appointed a com
mittee to arrange the meeting. They will
make public the conditions and all other
arrangements pertaining thereto next
week.
M. London has sold the veteran Uncle
Sam to Los Angeles parties. The south
ern climate may conduce to a rejuvena
tion. In this city his bread-winning days
were over.
The puppy stake at Ingleside to-day
opens up with an array of talent that will
keep the "talent" guessing throughout the
run down* There are many youngsters in
the contest that 1 could hold well up in
company of any age or experience. There
are several that have never been publicly
tested. Somebody is likely to find the
test costly.
Russell & "Wilson, the well-known
leashmen. of Cable, 111., make their bow
to the patrons of Ingleside this week,
with Glen Rosa and Victor Chief in the
champion stake. Glen Rosa has been a
Waterloo winner, but both are up against
hard game. Russell & Wilson's entire :
string embraces eight dogs and two pup
pies. They are quartered near Ingleside.
The running to-day at Ingleside takes
in the first two rounds of the the puppy
stake. To-morrow the champions will go
first to the slips, with the puppies follow
ing through one run down.' Immediately
thereafter the first heat of the match race
will be run. and the deciding heats fol
low after lunch. The first brace of flyers
goos to the slipper at 1 o'clock to-day,
and to-morrow at 10:30 o'clock.
The puppies seeming likely to land a
flag to-day are: Maid of Erin, Mystic,
Golden Russet, peculation, Bernice, Las
sie Hayes, Blacklock. Statesman, May
flower, Trinket. Mac's Melody. Kerry
Gow, Flying Cloud, Liberty Bell, Rath
bone, Minerva, Billy Gladstone, Innis
fallen, Royal Prize and Dauntless.
The champions emerging from the run
down should be: Gladiator, Rosie R,
Lass o' Gowrie, High Born Lady, Thorn
hill, Lady Jane, Victor, Old Glory. Moon
dyne, Occidental, Hadlwist, Myrtle, Hot
Stuff, Mialmo, - Laurelwood and Royal
Buck.
The winners of the Initial flags at Union
Park look to be as follows: Non-winner
stake â Benlcia Boy, Sportsman, Galla
gher, Lalla Rookh, Sylvanus, Lady Camp
bell, Chili Pepper, Blackstone, Monitor,
Mona, Wait a Little, Clifton Lass, Moon- i
light. Right Bower, Bonita, Governor

Bell, Miller's Maid. Glenwood, Butter
scotch, St. Gertrude, L. S. Conley, White
Wings, Bendalong, Little Dorrit, Ala
meda; champion Ferrona, Firm
Friend, Vanity Fair, Metallic, Cavalier,
Theron. .
The new , system which will go Into
operation to-day at Union Park will prac
tically place In the hands of the dog
owners themselves the selection of the
hare their dogs will be slipped to. The
fastest and best rabbits on hand are
placed Into chutes. Each chute contains
six coops, all of â¢ them being numbered.
On paslng the slip steward on their way
to the slips the owner of the dog "on the
white" will draw. an envelope containing
a number. Arriving at the slips the hare
in the coop with the corresponding num
ber in the envelope is the one which will
be slipped. This will be done in full view
of both owners or trainers. Should the
hare not prove satisfactory, the man who
drew : the number in the envelope â¢ can
only blame his own bad luck in not get
ting a hare more to his liking.
Mr. Russell of Cable, 111., arrived yes
terday with m. string of ten greyhounds
from the East. They will be heard from
after they become acclimated. The named
of the dogs are: Victor Chief, Glen Rosa,
Lady Hershell, Queen, Jennie Wilson,
Miss Alice, also two black and white
bitches by St. Clair, dam Maid of Honor.
Mr. . Russell has also two puppies, which
â will be run here in the Produce stakes.

HOMING PIGEONS
WILL FLY
FROM EL CAMPO.
On Sunday at 1 p. m., at El Campo,
there will be liberated the largest number
of these homing pigeons ever released
at one time on the Pacific Coast. Five
hundred of these intelligent birds will be
liberated to return to their respective
lofts throughout the State.
Most every one has seen a horse, dog
or boat race, but very few have had the
pleasure of seeing a homing pigeon race,
and this opportunity should not be
missed, as it will more than likely be the
only chance one will have.
In Europe this sport is very extensively
patronized. Belgium, In particular, de
votes a great deal of time and money for
the training of these pigeons. It Is an or
dinary event for 3000 homing pigeona to
be liberated at one time, and frequently
as high as 10,000 and 15,000.
The United States Government a few
years ago consented to experiment with |
these pigeons, and was so â¦ell satisfied \
that it now has some six Government
lofts throughout the country, one of
which is located on this coast, at Mare
Island, and contains some 200 or 300 of the
finest bred birds to be obtained.
The endurance, speed and homing in
stinct of the homing pigeon is something
wonderful. Pigeons have flown 700 miles
in a single dayâ mat is, from daylight
until dark. This record was made this
year by pigeons belonging to the Buffalo
district. It is a common occurrence to
have pigeons fly 500 miles in a single
day. The speed, too, in these distances
has been something remarkable. The
pigeons flying 700 miles in a single day
made over 1500 yards per minute, and the
birds flying SÂ»JO miles seldom make lesa
than 1000 per minute. Last year a bird
of one of the Eastern districts made over
1900 yards per minute in a distance of 300
miles.
The fancy on this coast is only in its
infancy, but the members of the Cali
fornia Pigeon and Homing Society are
making great strides toward equaling
the Eastern records.
The entries for El Campo race next
Sunday are:
H. P. Squires, Oakland, 12 birds; J. G.
Lubben, Alameda, 10 birds; J. W. Welch,
San Francisco, 30 birds; H. C. Worth,
San Francisco. 20 Birds; J. A. S. Low,

meda, 25 birds; C. H. Jewett. San Fran
cisco, 8 birds; H. G. Hemelright, San

TROUT-FISHING IN
THE HIGH SIERRAS
The following letter to The Call from
that expert fly-caster and hill-climber
John W. Bourdette will be found very
interesting to anglers v.ho contemplate
a trip in the mountains:
Trout fishing in the high Sierras Is about six
wi-iks earlier than usual, occasioned by the
dryness of the season and the gmall quantity
of snow now remaining on the mountain tops.
The feed, which is carried by the melted snow
into the lakes and streams of the mountains,
has by reason thereof become diminished to
eueh an extent that the finny tribe will now
take anything in the nature of food that is
thrown to them. The period of time interven
ing before the winter sets In will therefore
reward the sportsman for his efforts in quest
of such rare and exhilarating sport.
I was rewarded by an extremely good catch
on the north fork of the American Klver, in
the immediate vicinity of Snow Mountain. The
gamy Eastern brook trout, like "'Joseph's coat
of many colors," predominates in this stream
and readily takes the fly when properly handed
to them by the angler. Care should always be
taken not to alarm them, for they are shy
birds and know more than given credit for.
Tho Rubicon River, so called, rising at the
foot of the Rubicon ridge of mountain* to the
west of Lake Tahoe and flowing through the
Rubicon V alley, then emptying into the north
fork of the American River, will bÂ« found to
be an admirable stream on which to pass sev
eral pleasant days, abounding In Eastern
brook trout of fair size and gameness. They
now take the fly with alarming rapidity.
Sportsmen will find this stream admirably
adapted for casting, running as it goes for a
long distance through a gigantic granite for
mation, and is thereby devoid of trees and un
derbrush, so detrimental to the successful en
joyment of the sf>ort.
To reach Rubicon River take the stage which
leaves McKinney's on Lake Tahoe dally for
Rubicon Springs, where comfortable accommo
dations will be provided for those In search of
true sport and recreation.
To conclude your outing a trip to Glen Al
pine, the sportsman's paradise of the Bierras,
nestled in a pleasant nook on the crest of the
high mountains, should not be omitted. There
the rarest of sport awaile you. The chain of
lakes, comprising Lilly, Grass. Susie, Heather,
Halfmoon and Gilmore, lie in the immediate
vicinity. A visit to either will be a day well,
spent and enjoyed. The result of my last'
day's fishing was forty-eight pounds of the
finest of silver trout, taken from Halfmoon In
one day's lfshlng. Fishing on these lakes will
be found good just after daybreak and at dusk.
I luring the warm part of the day the fish r^st
under the crevices of rocks and large logs
which lie on the bottom of the lakes. Rumor
has It that an enterprising hotel proprietor Is
about to have filings made upon the lands sur
rounding these lakes and utilize them for his
special benefit, to the detriment and exclusion
of the general public. As these lakes are now
the property of the United States Government
and have been stocked by the Fish Commis
sion of the State of California at great cost
and labor, and having been used for more than
forty years as a fishing ground by the general
public. It is not to be presumed that the sports
men of this State will stand idly by and allow
any such scheme to be fostered ami carried
through, thereby depriving tho lovers of the
sport of the untrammeled privileges granted to
them by right of sovereignty to fish upon the
waters of the State of California.

which promises to surpass previous af
fairs of its kind. Six beautiful girls will
pin the coveted medals on the breasts of
the athletes, and then perhaps imprint a
kiss on their brows in recognition of their
splendid achievements.
ALAMEDA SENIORS
WILL MEET
THE MIDGET CREW
The all-absorbing topic among the oars
men is the approaching annual regattaâ
the fifthâ at Astoria. The members of
the Alameda senior crew have all pro
cured leave of absence from their variou*
employers, and will- go up by train to<
Astoria, their boat going up by steamer
in charge of their coach. The Midget?,
whom the South End men consider the
finest barge crew that was ever got to
gether, will also go to Astoria, and will
test their strength against the Alamedas.
This barge race has been specially added
to the programme by the Astorians. their
races being for shells only. It : is also
said that the Midgets are prepared, to
row in one of the four-oared shell races*
if they can procure a boat in which to
row But it is very doubtful whether
their stlye of rowing, while it is well
suited to a barge, would prove equally
good in a light racing boat. Their chanca
against crews which have been rowing
together for several weeks and whoso
style is better fitted to light boats would
probably be small. Such clubs as the
Willamette and the Portland, of Portland;,
the Burrard Inlet Rowing Club and the
Vancouver Boat Club, of Vancouver, and
the St. James Bay Rowing Club of Vic
toria, make strong and dangerous oppon
ents. Even oarsmen who have been spe
cially trained to row a stroke suitable
to a light boat, and whose style individ
ually is good, roll about considerably
when they first find themselves in a light
four or eight. Our oarsmen naturally
row in a style suitable for the rough
water prevalent in the bay during the
summer rowing season, and for the heavy
boats used here; the oarsmen on the
Columbia River and round Victoria ana
Vancouver enjoy much smoother water.
In a barge it is not necessary to be a
good waterman as well as a good oars
man; strength and a capacity for kÂ«*P
ing time are all that la â¢ needed. Then
the oarsmen of our bay suffer terribly
from a lack of competent coaching, with
out which no really good rowing is pos
sible. Probably the only club contain
ing any really trained oarsmen is the
Columbia Rowing Club, the members of
which take no part or interest in gen
eral rowing matters. Our. oarsmen row
by the light of nature, supplemented by
a few suggestions from men whose ex
perience has been longer, but whose orig
inal source of knowledge was the Bapte.
J. Foley of the South Ends is going
to Astoria on a vacation, but will prob
ably take no part in the regatta there.
On his return to this city he will begin
training fur the senior shell champion
ship. It would be interesting to see A.
W. Pape and Dr. C. C. Dennis in a skiff,
race at Astoria, but there seems no like
lihood of this.
F. Wilson of the Arlels and F. Ayera
of the Alamedas will probably enter the
out rigged skiff race at Astoria. There,
is talk of some match races between va
rious crows and single scullers, such as
a barge race between the intermediate
crews of the Dolphins and Pioneers and
a skiff race between Dr. C. C. Dennis
and A. W. Pape; so that it is not un-.
likely that a regratta may be got up be
fore the championship rej^itta.

there can be no doubt as to Its accuracy:
'â â  The "cause of his release is due to Sloan's

this "season Julius Fleischmann has scratched
horsed In big events just to .satisfy the whim

San Jose Purchases a
Gold Brick,
COSTLY FIRE ALARM SYSTEM
EX-MAYOR KOCH IS GETTING A
"ROASTING."
By His Careless Signing of a Contract
the City May Suffer a Loss
of Several Thousand
Dollars.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. s.â The city of San
Jose has a gold brick on its hands in
the shape of a new fire-alarm system.
This purchase was made through the
instrumentality of the old Council, but
the responsibllitv of the deal has been
shifted to ex-Mayor Koch's shoul
ders. And here it undoubtedly be
longs. The credit of the discovery of
the brick is due to Mayor Martin, and
just now he is busily enga-ed in the
endeavor to balk this attempt to bunko
the municipality.
The history of the purchase of a fire
alarm system is a long one. There
were more or less hints of boodle be
ing used to influence the Councilmen
when the matter was first broached,
and now these rumors of boodle are
aerain current on the streets. The buy
ing of the system by the old Council
caused much discussion and the mat
ter was taken into the courts by S. h..
Smith, a prominent member of the
New Charter Club. At that time Koch
then Mayor, condemned the Council
for wanting to make the purchase but
the loophole contract that he signed
for the purchase of the apparatus nas
turned the tide of condemnation, and
he is now receiving his share of the
"roasting." _ â
On January 25, 1898, A. J. Coffee, re
presenting the United States Fire and
Police Telegraph Company, and R. A.
Rose, agent of the Gamewell Fire
Alarm Company, submitted bids to the
city for a fire alarm system. The bid of
A. J Coffee was accepted. He proposed
to put in an up-to-date system, the city
to pay a rental of $65 per month for
five years. If within that time the
city wished to purchase the ap
: paratua they could do so for $3900.
i the rental money to apply on the pur
chase price. The Gamewell Company s
bid "was for $3300, or $55 per month, the
same conditions to apply in the pur
; chase or' the system.
The Superior Court denied an in
! junction to prohibit the Council from
i entering into a contract with Coffee.
j and Koch vetoed the resolution mak
; ing the purchase.
The old i 'ouncilâ composed of Fay,
Nolting. Krieg and Dittusâ still insisted
jon buying a fire alarm system. Bids
â  were again called for for a complete
storage battery system of 275 cells, a
i fire alarm switchboard, with necessary
: Implements for manipulation of ten
; circuits, and other apparatus. The buy
ing was to be on the lease proposition,
giving the city the option to purchase
at any time in five years.
Coffee and Rose responded with bids.
Coffee being again the highest. His bid
was $4400.
The Gamewell Company offered to put
'â  in a system for $3950, the city to pay
j a rental of $720 per year, or $60 per
month, for five years. The Council
thought that the conditions of puchase
were the same as in the previous bid,
and that whenever the city wished to
purchase the system the rentals would
apply on that sum. But Rose and Coffee
i placed a joker in their bids, and the
discovery was made a few days ago
that the city will probably be mulcted
jof several thousand dollars. The con
tract, as signed by ex-Mayor Koch,
makes it necessary for the city to pur
chase the plant Inside of a year in
order to have the rentals apply on thÂ»
price. Owing to the low condition of
the city's finances it will be impossible
to do so. In order to purchase it after
the first year it would cost the city
! $6830, as it would be necessary to pay
the four years' rental of $2880 and then
the original price of $3950.
The material for the system is now
at the broad-gauge depot, but unless
the contract is reformed the apparatus
Tv i 1 1 stay there for some time. The Po
lice and P'ire Commission have cited
Rose to appear and explain how it was
the contract was changed so that the
rentals should not apply on the pur
; chase price.
Mayor Koch says ho was of opinion
when ho signed the contract that the
conditions of rentals applying on pur
rhapp price were the same as in the
, first bid. In that case the system could
be bought at any time, and the rentals
', paid applied on the price. Just ho-w he
could be so careless as to overlook this
1 material point in the agreement he has
; failed to explain.
The former Councilmen all claim they
; understood the matter the same as did
Mayor K<rch, and for this reason voted
j for the Gamewell system.

Bightly Denounces Camp Merritt as
One of the Most Miserable Places
Maa Ever Was Forced
to Live In,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. s.â Life at Camp
Merritt, near San Francisco, where the
First Regiment New York Volunteers
has been awaiting orders to proceed to
Honolulu, is not all sunshine and de
light, according to James S. Barber, a
private in Company M, who tells of
some interesting experiences in a letter
received from him by a friend in this
city. He says:
"After reaching California we were
located at Camp Merritt, which was
certainly one of the most miserable
places a vvhlta man was ever forced to
live in. But when our commander,
Colonel Barber, saw the place his men
were encamped in he said: 'This is not
good enough for these men.' You know
we are known here as a millionaire
regiment. He knew what he was talk
ing about and the next morning we
were moved to the Presidio, where we
are now. Camp Merritt was certainly
a death hole and will soon be aban
doned. Men are dying daily there and
yesterday five men were buried from
camp.
"After our removal to the Presidio
we found it difficult to bathe at all.
Here we have cold weather, rain and
dust. Although the morning may dawn
brightly it is safe to bet that by 11
o'clock there will be clouds of Band that
you can only pass through by walking
backward. '
"This morning we had beans, frank
furters, bread and coffee for breakfast,
and before we had a chance to season
the food it was bo thoroughly covered
with sand that nepper was not needed.
"When we arrived >">re the cars ran
into the camp and as recompense to the
Government for running into the reser
vation they carried soldiers free. When
the report came that Camp Merritt was
to be moved to the Presidio the car line
immediately posted a notice that all
soldiers must pay unless provided with
tickets by their adjutants. The fact
that we are from New York opens all
doors to us."
SIX BOLD ROBBERS
MAKE A BIG HAUL
Most Daring Raid Made on a Michi

Cracksmen.
BICHLAND, Mich., Aug. s.â One of the
most daring and successful bank robber
ies ever perpetrated in Michigan was car
ried out by six robbers last night. Some
of them came from tXe East on a hand
car and evidently had confederates with
a horse and carriage. They Becured about
$snoo In cash from the Union Bank and
$4600 In notes.
There were three explosions which
awakened many people. Alvln Barnes, an
old man, who lived near the bank, was
ordered into the house with a threat that
they would shoot him. George Robson
and Ed Barrett saw the robbers, but did
not molest thÂ«m.
The safe was a complete wreck, nitro
glycerine being uspd to open it. The in
side doors were blown ten feet out into
the office and pieces went through the
plate glass front twenty feet distant.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 5.- The stream of specu
lation and Investment money continued to pour
Into stocks and bonds to-day without Interrup- j
tion. Prices throughout the list were lifted
â¢ sharply. The profit-taking movement which I
has been a drag on the leading industrials for i
several days past was apparently ended to-day, |
end the bean who sold these stocks early, on
the asumption that realizing was still in prog- ;
ress were glad to buy back later. The result i
vas to bring the Industrials into the general j
current of the market, which moved upward I
â¢with a tidal sweep. The railroads themselves '.
. were unsettled at the opening and most of the
leading stocks declined HS'.i before the upward j
movement of prices set in. The opening weak- I
ness was in sympathy with London, and the I
. quickness with which it was overcome was a j
striking evidence of the independence of the j
local exchange. Th?re was quit;; a serious dis- j
position to sell both In London and Farts on i
reported friction between Russia end Great '
Britain and there was quite urgent selling here 'â¢
for London account, but the supply of Ameri- ]
can securities .abroad has been bo far reduced j
In the past year that the disposition of foreign j
holders to buy and sell has much less influence ;
than formerly. The aggressive buying which I
has. been noticed in Wall street for several
days quickly turned prices upward and gained
In volume on the advance. Burlington contin- ;
ued to be the leader and scored an extreme ad- :
vance of 2*4. The other Grangers came next !
In point of importance and the Pacific roads
and their connections followed, with quite a'
list of lesser stocks trailing on to the move- ,
ment- A marked feature of the trading was !
the large individual blocks of stock which were !
taken at the opening figures. Quite a number
of the speculative leaders showed single trans
actions of 1000 shares or upward at the high
prices of the day. There was some disposition i
to realize In the last hour, but a decline of a :
fraction quickly reduced the market to dull- â 
ness. .The market was remarkably broad and i
brought Into, activity during the day many ;
long-dormant stocks. Dealings in bonds were I
â not on as large a scale as yesterday, but were j
large and well distributed and carried prices i
vigorously upward all through the list. Total j
sales, 14.945.U00. United States old 4's regis- I
tered advanced : , and the 3's. when issued,
declined Vs in the bid price.
Total sales of stocks to-day, 182,400 shares.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW TORK, Aug. s.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were stagnant in tone and dull
to-day on Chinese political matters, which
caused a fall In consols. Spanish securities
kept fairly good on the peace prospects.
Americans have been easier In sympathy with
other markets, but closed good. It Is generally
bellved that nothing serious will come of the
political situation, which, however. Is admitted
to be. rather critical.

FINANCIAL, REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Auk. s.âBradstreefa5 .â Bradstreefa financial
review to-morrow will say: Peace negotiations
and the tetter outlook for the corn crop, re
sulting frum rains at the West, have brought
a change in speculative conditions. The stock
market has boon broader and shows the pres
f increased public participation. Prices
have tended to advance and though the indus
trial securities bore an Important part in the
week's movements renewed attention has been
paid to the railroad share list and the grangers
stocks have resumed their position of leader
ship. Bonds have been active and strung.
Governments showing a decided disposition to
advance. The new 3 per cent war bonds are
the object of a decided buying demand aud
touched 106*4, while other classes of United
securities have been higher. In the
railroad bond list the advances have been
marked, an investment demand resulting In a
new price record for many of the bonds of
reorganised roads like ICrie, Atchison and
Northern Pacific, while speculative purchases
have helped values for the cheap low grade
I-rf'ndnn hae not been an Important fac
tor, and though sentiment there Is favorable,
eras sume foreipn selling on the advances
here. It might be noted that the chief effect
of the peace prospects on the market abroad
would not cause the rapid advance in the price
of J?].anieh 4s, which touched 42 In London,
while Â»t Madrid the gold premium fell to 67.
The beginning of gold Importations produced
little impression, owing to the plethora of
money, and far more significance has bÂ»en at
tached by the market to the present outlook
for an average yield of corn. This is reflected
by the decided strength of the securities of
porn-carrying railroads an.l the reappearance
of reports concerning increase of dividends or
th.-ir resumption by a number of companies.
At the sime time the revived activity of the
railroad lint has been partly at the expense
of the industrials. Some of the latter group,
which have been tho objects of bullish manipu
lation, fhnwol a disposition to loso part of
their recent advances.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, Aug. 5.â R. O. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
Prospects of peace stimulate many kinds of
business. In spite of records the impression
prevails that delay and hesitation have legiti
mately resulted from war and larger contracts
are In fact coming forward for Iron products
and a general better demand In most indus
tries. The vcriome of payments through all
clearing-houses was the largest ever known
in July, being 8 per cent larger than. In 1892
for the month and for the past week 11.7 per
cent ' larger. Most Industrial works have re
eunied after a shorter vacation, with fewer
participating than usual. A few labor troubles
call attention to the fact that this season has
been remarkably free from such hindrances.
In spite' of a promise of 700,000,000 bushels of
wheat this year the price Is 2V4c higher for the
week. The disposition of farmers to hold back
their wheat for prices more like those ob
tained recently accounts for smaller receipts
than last year but exports. Including flour,
were 3,64i;647 bushels, against 2,530.725 for the
same week last year, and for five weeks of the
crop year 12,474,839 bushels, against 9,873,192
last year.
A rather better demand for staple cotton
goods i lea not relieve the overproduction on
the print cloths and goods are practically un-
hanged in price. Western stiffness In holding

eral mills have closed for the time rather than
pay the prices asked for wool. . . â¢.â '-.â 
The Iron manufacture has very nearly, If not
quite, resumed its full production, except In
the valleys, where Bessemer producers are
closing In turn under agreement to force prices
upward. â¢ While there has been large buying,

mand, both East and West, and structural
works are full, with likrge contracts coming
forward in all sections. Bars are bo much
stronger that many mills refuse less than $1
for Iron, though steel bars sell largely at 90c.
Failures for the week have been 196 In the
United tSates, against 237 last year, and 21 in
Canada, against 29 last year.
BRADSTRKET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Aug. 6.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will cay: The stimulating influences of the
apparently near approach of peace, coupled
with the generally expected effects it is hoped
will float from the opening up of new markets
In the lands added to the national domain,
seem to increase as the summer wanes. That
the improvement, while as yet admittedly one
largely of sentiment, is not seriously confined
however, is proven by reports of a still fur
ther Increase In the distribution of staple goods
In the West. Northwest and Southwest, where
the excellent crop situation has rendered harm
less the supposed benumbing effects of war.
So far as the crop situation Is concerned, the
past week furnishes not the least notable con
tribution of the year in reports coming from
the great surplus corn producing States of
beneficial rains, checking a detonation which
threatened material damage to this most widely
grown and Intrinsically valuable of the
country cereals. While the tendency gener
ally Is to concede some diminution in the corn
yield as a result of the recent drought, the
steadiness of the price of that cereal bears wit
ness to the willingness of the trade to believe
that some falling off in this year's yield can be
safely permitted, in view of the bumper crops
of recent years. Another encouraging feature
of the week has b^en the perceptible growth In
Etrength of the iron and steel situation, partly
as the result, it is claimed, of the hoped for ap
proaching close of hostilities, but partly also as
the result of an active demand on foreign ac
count for nearly all forms of these metals.
Particularly notable Is the demand, more es
pecially In the central West, for Iron for im
plement manufactures and for steel rails and
plans for export, or for domestic shipbuilding.
Firmness in prices is a feature of particular
Interest, In view of the enormous production of
pig Iron early in the year, ami apparently re-
Ilects the going Into consumption of most of
this Immense production, leaving stocks gen
erally within controllable limits.
Encouraging export demand for our cereals.
Xt-eat steadiness of prices, largest recorded mid
summer bank clearings and fairly encouraging
railroad earnings, notwithstanding the willing
ness of farmers to accept cereal values, are ad
ditional encouraging features of trade at the
present time..
Prices are quite generally firmer, tending up
ward, in pplte of the midsummer quietness in
many lines of trade. An a result, of operations
in July. 32, or about one-third of all staples,
advanced In value; 27 declined, while 44 re
mained steady or unchanged. Advances in
many cereals, except wheat and flour, live
beeves and hogs, a number of provisions, dairy
products and groceries, most raw textiles ex
cept cotton; petroleum, rubber, alcohol, opium
and quinine are features of me month's oper
ations. Important dpcreases, aside from that
in wheat, are found in some makes of Iron and
steel, some other metals and in building lum
ber. Compared with August one year ago 66
out of 104 staples are higher; 29 are lower, and
9 are unchanged, so that It may be said that,
compared with a year ago, there have been
more than two advances ror every decline re
ported.
Business failures In thÂ« United Sfcates are at
the minimum, numbering 3*3, identical in num
ber with those of last w^ek, but compared with |
214 In this week a year ago; 248 in 18%, 209 In |
1895, and 197 In 1894. Canadian failures num
ber 23 against 31 last week, 41 in this week a
year ago; 35 in 1896; 31 in 1896 and 40 In 1894.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. E.â sharp rally at Liver
pool before the opening here started wheat
higher. The foreign strength was supplemented
by the domestic situation, the principal feature
of the letter being small receipts and conse
quent Inadequacy of supplies for Immediate
shipment East and abroad. Chicago receipts
were 87, against 12-4 last year. Minneapolis
and Duluth, 70 cars, whereas 270 were received
a year ago. The total receipts at Western pri
mary markets were 412,000 bushels, against
847,000 bushels the similar day of last year.
Atlantic port exports were liberal. Such rea
rons were sufficient to account for the lc a
bushel advance in September wheat that re
sulted in the first half of the session. Decem
ber, as it has been doing of late, participated
to only a small extent In the bullishness of
September. A good deal of the short September
"bought In" was resold for the more distant
month. The demand for the scanty offerings
of carload wheat In the sample market was al
together In excess of the supply. The demand
for shipping lots was even more urgent than
It was yesterday and the premium bid over
the September price for immediate shipment
was Be. while Sc premium was bid for ship
ment up to thÂ» end of the month. September
Closed lc higher and December %c.
The strength in wheat and a sharp advance
In the spot article at Liverpool were the lead
ing influences in corn. September closed with
an advance of H#t%c over yesterday.
Oats were firm in sympathy with the other
markets. The close was Me higher for Sep
tember.
The better tone In provisions W4J due to
the strength In grain and higher prices for
hogs at the yards. There was very little prod
uct -for future delivery offered, and that which
did find Its way Into the pit was quickly ab
sorbed at advanced prices. Pork rose 7%c and
lard and ribs 2%c each.

DRIED FRUITS. NUTS, RAISINS, ETC.
The scarcity In Apricots Is well illustrated by
the sale of six cars at Plru, Ventura County.
at the reported price of 10c. This Is said to be
the only large lot of Apricots In the State this ;
year. Of course there are numerous small '
lots scattered about.
The scarcity of Apricots Is expected to cause
high prices for reaches, especially as this crop
is also very short. . " - .....
As for Prunes, Eastern buyers are bidding
3'-c for the four sizes of the new crop In the
outside districts, without, however, getting any.
In the leading districts bids of 4c have been
turned down, as the holders positively refuse to

The circular of Jacob "Wollner says:
"Of our â¢ local market there la little to be
said, as there have been no transactions : and
there., have been no buyers in ( the market. - It
can be termed a waiting market, as until there
are some | orders for scoured wools ' very little
can be done.
"The Kastern markets are reported as fol
lows: The market presents a firmer tone as
a whole and considerable inquiry is noted. For
the first time since the tariff went into effect
there was more foreign wool . than domestic
sold last week, the . total amount being about
0.000.0C0 pounds, of which 3.000,000 were foreign.
"The goods market is showing, more hope
ful features, but orders obtained as yet on the
new i trade â¢ have been moderate. The prospect
of the price of wool is yet to attain the im
porting basis, although owing to the past seven
months' dullness It will be much â  longer than
we expect before this point Is peached. The
old" wool on hand is yet a check on higher
prices. With the new wools coming In and
costing high, dealers, feel more confidence in
the old wools and it looks as though a gradual
hardening of values will follow from now on.
An active . market for {roods will hurry me
problem and will bring the thing to a iocua
much quicker than otherwise." -

which, if carried out, will Bound the
; death knell of the committee of one hun
dred and defeat, beyond peradventure of a
: doubt, the Indorsement of Maguire. This
i plan, which only leaked out to-day, was
communicated to the Alameda Democ
racy wfth the request that they bestir
themselves and aid in carrying it to a sue
;ul conclusion.
It is nothing less than for the Country
to combine against the City and to unseat
the entire San Francisco delegation on
. the ground that it was named In violation
of all the laws of the party and does not
represent the Democrats of SÂ±ui Fran
cisco.
It is a bold move, but assurances have
been received that it is meeting with
much favor throughout the interior coun
ties, and it is certain that if it is carried
out it will put an p^d to the hybrid ticket
begun by the Populists and left for the
Democrats to finish.
Moreover, it is aserted that the move
ment has reached the ears of the chief
conspirators and the fear that it will be
carried out has kept them from coming
forward with a candidate r"'>r chairman of
the convention. It would be awkward, to
say the least, for them to go to Sacra
mento with one of their number slated to
preside over the gathering only to have
the entire delegation thrown out of con
vention.
As the Alameda Democrats discuss this
scheme to end the political lif<- of tho
wreckers of their party, tTiey resolve to
tuimj Alameda into line with her forty
i t delegates solid for the movement;
two of her three delegates at Large have
ly declared themselves as deter

Hon. F. S. Strati' San Francisco, Cal.â
Dear Senator: During your incunibency of the

the office of one of the city Justices of Oak-
After more than five years' experience as j

to call to his assistance any Justice of the

I believe that public affairs should be con

would be said of a buslnes man who permitted
a leak of this kind in his business? -
I have made an effort to make this court
pelf-sustaining, but the Income cannot be ma

with the township Justice's Court, which is on
a fee basis. a man win give his business to
un Individual rather than a municipality.
Senator, I believe that upon careful con
sideration you will take this matter In hand
and relieve the tax payers of this one of the
many unjust ones they now bear. You know
that it is such extravagant salaries and use
less offices that has placed our taxes at the
highest notch, and driven away from our city
home and Investment seekers. I will be pleased
to talk with you on this matter, either at your
office or mine, and furnish you with any infor
mation you may desire. If the office is to be
abolished It Is important that It be made
known before any candidates announce them
selves for the place. Hoping for an early and
favorable reply, I am, sincerely yours.
FRED V. WOOD.
Judge Wood says that It would be of
no use for him to resign, as that would
not abolish the office and would only give
the , Supervisors an opportunity to ap
point a successor, and as fhe salary is in
the nature of a bonus inflicted on the in
cumbent by the electors, Judge Wood
Bays he has certainly the prior right to It.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 5.
The stockholders In "Swiftwater Bill's"
company who reside in this city are not
In the least alarmed over the story sent
from Dawson that Mr. Gates has met
with a pecuniary unpleasantness. One
member of the expedition led north by
Gates from tills city some months ago
returned from Dawson to-day, and
brought a very reassuring report to Di
rector W. J. L>ayinniice.
It was in Oakland that Mr. Gates"
dream of taking to Dawson a company of
adventurers was realized. Mr. Gates
niado a K^od impression on the com
munity by purchasing the beautiful Hen
shaw mansion In the Lakeside district
and paying $2G,uuO for it, and after that
it was an easy matter for him to form
a stuck company. Mr. Gales was the
president, William J. Htnshaw (the
Danker) vice-president and Mr. Lay
mance the general manager. Since that
time Mr. Gates' little vagaries induced
Mr. Henshaw to withdraw, and Mr.
Laymance is now only a director. The
trouble with Dr. WOOlf at Dawson,
which cost Mr. Gates $2."Â»,rxlu to settle, was
not a surprise to the local stockholders.
"We were aware of the fact," said Mr.
Laymance, "that 'Swlftwater' borrowed
$25,000 from Dr. Woolf, and we knew that
he entered into a partnership with Smith
to run a saloon. These affairs are sim
ply copartnei>hlp affairs between Gates
and Smith, and do not affect the com
pany. Claim 13. of which Gates owns
one-eighth, turned out a Quarter <>t" a
million dollars, and his share was over
$40,0<X), so that he was quite able to at
tend to Dr. Woolf and stock his saloon
besides.
"One of our stockholders returned from
Dawson to-day, and brought us full ac
counts of 'Swiftwater's' doings. Every
thing is going along smoothly, and the
property la producing as richly as ever.
The men he took on the expedition are
now engaged in logging and filing their
timber on the company's property, ready
for use as soon as mining- again com

"'Mr. Gates is still the owner of th,e

dence."

OPPOSES ANNEXATION
OF THE PHILIPPINES
THE LABOR COUNCIL PUTS IT-
SELF ON RECORD.
Unahatable Conditions Existing
There Would Be a Menace to
Our Government.
At the meeting of the Snn Francisco
Labor Council last night a firm stand was
taken against the proposition to annex the
Philippine Islands upon practically the
same grounds as the Council some time
ago opposed annexation of Hawaii. The
resolutions were prepared by W. J. Mac
arthur of the Sailors' Union. Mr. Mac
arthur followed the sea for many years,
and having visited almost every spot on
the globe where merchant or carrying
ships touch is well posted on the condi
tions, manners and customs of all the im
portant islands in the Pacific. The resolu
tions are as follows:
Whereas, The developments of the war
against Spain have created a question as to
the ultimate policy of the United States with
regard to the Spanish territory occupied by our
forces, particularly In the Philippine Islands;
therefore, be It .
Resolved, By the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil that we favor such disposition of the
Philippines as will redound to the greatest
rood of the Inhabitants thereof, without com
mitting the United States to a prolonged or
permanent responsibility for their government
and that we advise against the permanent re
tention of the Islands on the following grounds:
1. The possession ' and government of terri
tory lying at a great distance from the parent
country would be a departure from the policy
on. which our country is founded and upon
which It has grown to Its present dimensions
and power: a departure uncalled for by any
necessity of the general welfare and particu
larly inadvisable under the circumstances of
war and conquest with which the question is
Involved. :;:... : ' , ',-'â '. "â¢. "
2 The possession and government of terri
tory lying in or adjacent to the tropics neces
sarily Involves a policy opposed to the genius
of free Institutions, in that the natives of
such territory have so far displayed an in
capacity for self-government: hence they must
be governed by force in violation of the funda
mental principle that 'all just governments
rest upon the consent of the governed, and. at
great expense and constant danger. to the gov
e?m Territory lying In or adjacent, to the
3 Territory lying In or adjacent to the
tropics' cannot be colonized by the American
people owing to the enervating Influences of
climate and soil. Such territory must always
remain a mere "possession" or "dependency,
the soil of which must be worked by the na
tives under conditions more or less allied to
slavery and rendering tribute to the owners
of the soil and providing places of power and
emolument to Government favorites. â¢
4 The addition of such a system to the ex
isting problems of our Government. Intricate
and pressing as they are, would certainly work
harm to our people, not only by. distracting
pubUc attention from domestic affairs, but by
hindering the accomplishment pf means de
signed for the- safe and progressive conduct of
American affairs, owing to the inherent diffi
cult v if not impossibility, of constructing leg
islation concerning people and occupations of
widely different character and location.
Resolved. That we disapprove of the. plea for
the retention of the Philippine Islands on the
pretext of "expansion of" trade," believing
that such plea is inspired by the purely com
mercial instinct of profits, regardless ,of the
results, of permanent occupation. Â v

In Next Sunday' 3 Call,
MAY TEAR UP
OLD TRACKS
Several Franchises Have
Been Violated.
WATKINSON'S NEW 'MOVE
STREETS SHOULD BE CLEAR CF
DISUSED RAILS.
Many Miles Have Been Discarded
Under the New System of the
Railroad Syndi
cate.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 5.
The tearing up of unused street rail
road tracks in San Francisco threatens
to become epidemic so far as Oakland
is concerned. The desire to rid the streets
of the nuisance of discarded tracks has
seized Councilman Watkinson and he has
inaugurated a movement to have all rails
taken up on streets where the fraiichis-s
are not in use.
There are many miles of such tracks
in this city. When the street railroads
were divided among half a dozen com
panies, routes were paralleled on alter
nate Mocks in nearly all directions. When
the syndicate bought in all the smaller
companies with the exception of the
Southern Pacific lines and the Haywards
electric road it entered upon an adminis
tration of economy that included cutting
off every inch of road that did not
and of discontinuing every line that ran
in the B&me direction and within a few
blocks of another line.
In West Oakland there were three lines
going to Sixteenth-street depot; now there
ure but two. In Oakland proper lines
were duplicated on almost every street
In the center of the city. But now many
small franchises are discarded and many
less cars are required to perform the
Bervice. In East Oakland the branch of
the Highland Park road along Commerce
street is discontinued, and the travel both
ways his been diverted to Thlrt>
avenue. On Eleventh street, east of
Broadway, the cars have been taken off
for some distance and are brought in on
Twelfth strict, and a franchise is now
being sought so that more of Eleventh
street can be abandoned. Formerly there
were two systems running to Mountain
View Cemetery; now there is but one.
All thene changes have left small por
tions of franchises unused all over town
and Mr. Watkinson is of the opinion that
the rails should be at once taken up.
City Attorney Dow baa advised the
Council that the franchises must be for
feited by ordinance, and a resolution will
be Introduced at the next meeting citing
the superintendent of the company to
;ipi>ear and show cause why the aoiindon
ed portions of the road should not be
cleared of the tracks.
MARE'S NEST IN NORTH SEA.
Discovery or Japanese a.iguumuci=,
La Mafia, Russian Nihilists and -
Fenians by the Commissioner.
Immigration Commissioner North has
discovered tWO or three mares' n-sts
while occupying his present office, and is
giving Commissioner Powderly the bene- !
lit thereof. One Is to the effect* that he
has learned that there are Japanese
highbinders in this city and that they go
armed with knives concealed in fans and
are scattered all over town thirsting for
blood. It is proper to say for the benefit
of strangers, like Commissioner Powder
ly who is in danger of being- "worked"
by this yam, that there is not a word of
truth in the allegation and that neither
the police nor the press have learned of
the existence of such an organization.
But it is understood that Mr. Norths
imagination will not be iKmtent to rest
here and that his report to Mr. Powderly ,
will give the particulars of the doings i
of a band of Russian nihilists, who feed
their blood-thirsty appetites on caviar
and onions in a well-known beer saloon
.very Saturday night under the pretense
of being a Maguire Club. It is under
stood also that Mr. North s> able state
document will tell all about the nefarious
designs of La Mafia, members .of which
have been seen eating spaghetti and
cheese with a most ferocious expression
of countenance. After that it will be mare
child's play to inform Mr. Powderly of
the existence of the Fenian Brotherhood
in this city, all the members of which are
being watched with an eagle. eye oy Mr.
North just before election. . .

USED A HATCHET.
William Johnson and Jerry Sullivan
Fight Over a Woman.
A quarrel over a woman resulted in a
tight between William Johnson, a painter,
and Jerry Sullivan, an expressman, last
evening and during the encounter the
former used a lather's hatchet on Sulli
van, inflicting several superficial wounds
on his head and face. Johnson was ar
rested by Officer Dillon and taken to the
Harbor Station and charged with assault
to murder. The wounded man was re
moved to the hospital, where his slight In
juries were dressed by Doctors Hill and
Zabala.
Two months ago the trouble between
the men first commenced and at that time
It is claimed that Sullivan used a knife
on Johnson. Since then Johnson says he
has been avoiding the expressman, fcut he
asserts that last evening as be was going
to his shop at 16 Commercial street Sul
livan assaulted him with a club, and
shows a lacerated wound on the right arm
lr, support of the statement. During the
fight John Davis, a friend of Sullivan,
who tried to prevent trouble, received a
cut on the arm.
Fish Killed With Dynamite.
The State i-ipn l ommissionera are re
joicing over the rapture of three fellows
who for the past few years have caused
them much trouble. Complaints were
frequent that fish of all kinds and sizes
were being destroyed in the Russian
River by the use of dynamite. Many
time's the dcpiraflfl of the commission
have made trips along the river, but the
miscreants seemed to know when they
were near, and nothing came of the at
tempts to stop the destruction until last
Saturday. Deputy C. A. Vogelsang, as
sisted by Constable Ord of Cloverdale.
made a raid into Mendocino County, and
were so fortunate as to arrest three Por
tuguese, against whom they have all the
evidence necessary to secure a convic
tion. Two others, learning of the fate of
their comrades, made tlieir escape. The
prisoners were taken to T'kiah, where
they were held in $500 bonds each for
trial in the Superior Court by Justice of
the Peace Critch field. This makes the
sixteenth arrest for killing fish with dy
namite this season.

ney A. A. Fviedlander.
The dispute between Washington Ir
win and Attorney A. A. Friedlander as
to the ownership of the Dawson City sa
loon, 230 East street, which has been
taken into the Superior Court, will also

for him. which he retained for his own
usi s and purposes.
Irwin's wife was also around the courts
wanting a warrant for Friedlander's ar
res I for using vulgar and disgraceful lan
guage toward her. As she had no wit
ness with her she did not get the warrant.

ORDERED
THE CASE
DISMISSED
Peculiar Methods of
Judge Mogan.
WILLIS' SUPREME PULL
THE JANITOR - POLITICIAN
SCORES A VICTORY.
He Induces the Court to Have the
Woman Whom He Insulted
Taken Into Cus
tody.
Ike Willis, politlcip-n and janitor, was
arrested Thursday night and charged
â with vulgar language.
Shortly after 1" o'clock a woman who
poses as his wife was walking along
Powell street, when she was accosted by
Willis, who' applied an opprobrious epi
thet to her. Sergeant Harper, who hap
pened to be present, placed Willis under
arrest for vulgar language. Yesterday
the case was heard by Judge Mogan and
notwithstanding that Sergeant Harper
[vely swore that Willis had used the
language attributed to him, the court dis
missed the charge.
To the astonishment of the arresting
officer and even Willis himself Mogan
turned to Harper and ordered him to ar
rest, the woman.
"She is the guilty party," he rather em
phatically remarked. "I order you to
bring her into this court forthwith."
The extraordinary action of Mogan
dumfounded the court attaches and
d a titter of merriment to run
through the crowd of hangers-on. Har
per attempted to explain that it was a
mistake to arrest the woman, but he
was promptly cut short by the officious
Judge.
As the woman was In no way guilty of
tiny wrong-doing, but was grossly insult
ed by Willis, Chief L< es does not intend
to arrest her. The police admit that .she
is not of good character, but they claim
that Mogan has no right to order her
into custody, considering that no charge
is pending against her. They also assert
â¢\Villi:- i living with the woman
and as she threatened to leave him he
resorted to billingsgate in order to in
timidate her.
Several witnesses were subpenaed by
rosecution to show that Willis had
used vile language, and when placed un
der arrest threatened to "break" the- of
ficer. For some unexplaii.- >i reason the
ling officer of No. 1 court refused
â¢:y. but ordered Wil
lis discharged without even the formality
of a trial.
Willis has frequently boasted that he
could "squar any i ase In the Police
Court, and judging fr..m the disposition
Of his case he has certainly kept his
word.
FOR PURE FOOD AND
SMOOTH HIGHWAYS
REVIVING THE COUNCIL OF
ASSOCIATED INDUSTRIES.
Meeting of Delegates from the Com
mercial Bodies to Be Called.
To Enter Into Politics.
The first move toward reorganizing the
Council of Associated Industries was
made yesterday by the Manufacturers'
and Producers' A ' 'â â , as previous
|y announced by The CalL At a meet
ing of the directors of that body Presi
dent Sbarbaro stated that the Legisla
ture is to meet soon, and it is now time
to take up the work again that was un
dertaken before the lasi session of the;
law makers at Sacramento. The com- j
bined efforts of the Chamber of Com- j
meree, California State Board of Trade,
Merchants' Association, Miners' Associa- j
tion and other equally influential bodies
had done much good for the general pub
lic, but the work was by no means Jin- ;
ished. The pure food question must be!
taken hold of again and agitated until
the laws are made so strici that it will
be better for dealers and manufacturers
to furnish pure foods than adulterated
and impure goods. For the protection
of free white labor the lines must bo j
drawn closer and tighter around the con- i
vht-made goods question. Better roads
must be constructed and all these re
forms must be accomplished through the !
representatives of the people in the Leg- i
islature.
It was also stated that the associa
tfon would not enter into politics for the i
sake of politics, l.ut for the benefit of .
the State, and the people and the en
largement of the industries. It was de- '
cided to have Presideni J. A. Filcher call ;
a meeting of the council at an early date ;
and begin the laying of a plan for fu
ture operations. Previous to asking for
this c.iil the officers of the Manufactur
ers' Association will hold a meeting with !
the Board of Health and Attorney Dunne
with a view ot learning what amend- I
merits to the present lAWS and what new
laws will be desirable to recommend :
when the council meets. The purpose of
this is to find what can be accomplished
and what is the most important to com
mence upon lirst. Then there must be j
work with all the power at the disposal I
of the organizations to accomplish the]
desired results.

OUTSIDE DISTRICT LIGHTS.
The Question Being Carefully Con-
sidered by the Supervisors.
Since the new contract for the lighting
of the public streets has been let to the
Ban Francis-) Gaa mid Electric Light
Company, which runs fur two years from
the iirst of the present month, several
applications have been made, to the Su
pervisors and ;ih : '> the light company for
lamps on outside districts.
â¢ The petition <>f H. H. Clifford Is for him
self and other property owners on the
line of Silver avenue from Mission street
to the San Bruno road, a distance of
about three mites. On this stretch of
tew territory, which has within the past
Sew years income a favorite drive, the
firoperty owners want thirty-five electirc
ipiits distributed at the intersections of
Cambridge, Way land, Bacon, Girard, Bur
rows, Felton, Gottinken, University, Ed
inburgh, London and Sillman streets, or
such other points as the Supervisors may
designate, so long as the lamps are placed
aloiiK the line of street.
In addition to this they ask that hy
drants be placed at convenient locations,
so they may be approached by the en
gines of the Fire Department. Added to
this the service of a few police call boxes
would be considered a special favor to
the residents, as well as a convenience
to the officers on duty. Fifteenth ave
nue (south) is Jn for a requisition for a
few lamps from San Bruno road to Rail
road avenue.
Sunset Valley has asked for ten 2000
randle power lights for that section;
Richmond wants six distributed over its
ares; Capp street is modest and would
be satisfied with four, while the people
living along the line of the Mission and
who travel over the Ingle.side road want
.at the very least fifteen, from Mission
street to the end of the electric car line
west of the race course. Van Ness and
Golden Gate avenues are, it is under
stood, to be lighted up, as they are the
two main driveways from the lower por
tion â  " ho city to the park.
The Park Commissioners are laying
mains along the western roads for con
duits through which wires will be run
to light up all the driveways from Stan
yan street to the ocean. Lamps are now
up as far west as Strawberry Hill, and
before the winter months set in the en
tire western portion will be lighted up.
It is expected that during next week
the Supervisors will issue instructions to
the light company to proceed with the
locating of poles for the outside dis
tricts.

Her life blighted by the suicide of her
husband, her prospects in life darkened
by poverty and her mind possibly weak
; ened by -worrying. Mrs. Elizabeth Reiner
of 214 Turk street has evidently concluded
that life is not worth the living, and that
she will follow her husband to a suicide's
j grave. The despondent woman on Au
gust 2 wrote to Coroner Eden of Marin
County, at San Rafael, the following let
j ter:
SAN FRANCISCO. Aug. 2. 1893.
i O Coroner Edenâ l wait for you terrible bad.
'My landlord sent notice to me to pay rent In
3 days or leave the house. What shall I do?
i I find no work this day. I think It best for me
! next to my husband. Please call Quick. I nope
: you find me In the same place. REINER.
214 Turk street. ELIZABETH REINER.
The story of Frederick W. Reiner and |
his wife is a sad one. Reiner inherited a
fortune some years ago from j
relatives in Germany. The amount j
that he received has been . n _ e '"" I
mated all the way from SSOOO to |200.000.
This money he squandered, some say,
while others, among them his wife, de
clare that he lost it in the real estate
business, in which he was engaged lor |
some time. .-,
About a year ago, when his money was !
nearly all gone, he married. The woman i
was a widow and the mother of a little ;
girl. "When down to his last dollar he I
pawned, his diamonds and other jewelry j
and a Tine gun, which he had brought
with him from the German army, in
which he had served. With the proceeds
he went to Mexico in the hope of retriev
ing his fortunes.
"Soon after he had gone," said Mrs.
I Reiner, who was found at her humble
â  home last evening, "1 became despondent,
and. knowing that if Mr. Reiner failed in j
getting money, he would kill himself, as â¢
!he had threatened, I went out to the j
Cliff House, determined to drown myself |
and my little girl. With my child in my
arms I walked into the ocean, and some
water dashing into the little one's mouth, ;
she said, "Oh, mama, don't go any fur- I
! ther; I will get wet.' That stopped me.
1 thought for a moment, and then walked j
; out of the water. The child had saved ,
our lives, only to prolong our misery-
Reiner returned from Mexico penniless
and despondent. He and his wife then
went to Keswlck and worked there a
month, but not being able to stand The
' sulphurous fumes, they came back to San
' Francisco and took a house in an alley at
! oij Turk street*
* Foi a few weeks Mrs. Reiner obtained
: employment as a seamstress on Govern
ment clothing, her husband meantime en- j
deavoring in every possible way to secure \
work, but without success. The govern- j
ment sewing was completed, and again
were the Reiners without a cent.
Reiner had written to his relatives ask
ing them to lend him $1500 with which to
go into some business, and one day, about i
i three weeks ago, he received an answer ]
stating that they would not loan him any j
money. That day he went to Mill Valley
and killed himself. He lies buried in the
I potter's field near San Rafael. _â¢
"My letter to Coroner Eden, said Mrs. i
i Reiner, "was written for the purpose of
having him come to see me about my hus
band's affairs. Eden is the administrator
of his estate. I wanted him to get my hus
band's gun out of pawn and raffle it off,
and with the money give Mr. Reiner a
burial place in the San Rafael Cemetery.
I think Mr. Eden has some notes of my
husband, and I wanted to see if he could
not collect the money due on them. I have
been trying every day to get work, par- j
ticularly sewing. I ask no charity. All
> 1 want is work. I do hope some one will
I help me by giving me something to do.
"When my husband had money he had
! friends. When he lost his money he lost
his friends. Not one of them has assisted
\ me _ no t even .encouraged me. Do you
i wonder that I am despondent and wish to
be laid beside my husband? But for the
I sake of my child I shall try to live. But
work I must have to get bread for the lit
| tie one."
HER GLOVES CAUGHT FIRE.
Florence Williamson, a Nurse, Has
Both Hands Burned.
Florence Williamson, a nurse, living at
28 Webster street, while visiting friends at
Â»!23 O'Farrell street last night had both
her hands severely burned. Noticing that
her gloves were soiled the unfortunate
woman cleaned them with gasoline and
thf-n held them over a lighted coal oil
lamp to dry.
While her attention was temporarily ab
stracted the gloves caught fire and before
she could extinguish the flames her hands
were badly burned. The injured woman
was taken to the Receiving Hospital by a
friend, where she was treated by Dr.
Thomas Maher.

TO HUNT FOR
A DERELICT
The Steamer Iroquois
Ordered Out.
THREE VESSELS ARE MISSING
IT IS PROBABLY THE REMAINS
OF ONE OF THEM.
Shipping Men Think It Is the Hull
of the Schooner Nomad, Long
Overdue at Puget Sound
From China.
The identity of the derelict that has been
sighted a number of times during the last
month by different coasting vessels will
soon be known. Captain Turner of the
United States steamship Iro<iuois re
ceived instructions yesterday to proceed
to Mare Island. There explosives will
be taken on boÂ«rd and the vessel will pro
ceed to sea in search of the vessel that
has for months been a menace to navi
gation. Captain Turner's instructions are
to bring the derelict into port if possi
ble, and if not to blow it up.
The first news came from Seattle in
the early part of last June. A vesse.l
bottom up was sighted off the Oregon
coast and the conclusion was reached that
it was the remains of the four-masted
schooner Nomad, long overdue at Puget
Sound from China. On June 15 Captain
Christenson of the schooner Eliza Miller
sighted another or the same derelict in
latitude 43.19 north, longitude 1ZJ.51 west.
In talking about the wreck yesterday
Captain Christenson said it might be the.
remains of the Nomad that he sighted
and again it might not. The hull stood
too high out of the water for the vessel
to have been laden when she turned over.
The vessel was apparently new and had
been freshly painted, but where the paint
had been worn off by the friction of the
waves he could see the cement in her
seams.
On July 16 Captain Rasmussen of the
schooner Louise also sighted the derelict
in latitude 38.08 north, longitude 129.54
west. From his description a number of
shipping men came to tne conclusion that
it was the hull of the baâ¢K Forest
Queen, long overdue at San Pedro from
Puget Sound, which he had sighted, while
others again thought it the remains of
the schooner Jane Gray. The latter ves
sel left Puget Sound last May for Kut
zebue and when ninety miles off Cape
Flattery capsized. Out of the sixty-two
people all told o;i hoard thlrty-r"uur were
drowned, and the vessel was supposed to
have foundered. No one actually saw
the vessel go down and shipping men
think that after the cargo and ballast
fell out of her the vessel rose out of the
water and has been floating around ever
since.
The general impression among the un
derwriters in regard to the thrice-sighted
derelict is that it is the hul. <.r the
schooner Nomad. The Forest Queen had
a deckload of piles, and they say that
she surely split up ami went to pieces.
The Jane Gray is reported to have gone
down, and as she was an old vessel the
chances are that if she did not kÂ» to the
bottom she has been battered to pieces
long ago. The Nomad was a new vessel
on her maiden voyage and in ballast. It
would, therefore, seem to be "that she is
the derelict. If it is the Nomad, the
identilication of the hull will be the end
of a very sad tale. Captain MeAlep was
in command of her, and his sonâ his only
childâ was also on the vessel. The wife
and mother is now at Seattle and refuses
to believe that the Nomad is lest, and
spends all her time waiting for tidings of
the missing vessel.
After leaving port Captain Turner will
take the lroquois out to the place where
the derelict was last sighted by Captain
Rasmussen of the schooner Louise. He
will then follow the set of the current,
and In a few days hopes to com" up with
the wreck. If by any possible means he
can tow it into port he will do so; it' not,
a charge of dynamite will be put into
thjf hull, and the danger to navigation
removed in that way.
The underwriters are very much inter
ested In the removal of the derelict, as
it Is a t-erious menace to navigation, and
it was at the request of some of them
that The Call took the matter up. The.
first article which appeared in this paper
was cut out and sent to Washington, and
the result is the starting out of the lro
quois.
The ship Tacoma, with horses for Ma
nila, will not get away until some time
to-day. She was to have sailed early
yesterday morning, but the smokost a< k
had to be lengthened; hence the delay.
When Chief Engineer M. Henry came
to get steam on the boilers that supply
the condensers and work the electric
plant he found that there was not enough
draught to keep up a good tire. The
smokestack had hern made short so as
not to interfere with the utility of the
ship's sails, but as it would not work in
that way a gang ot men had to be sent
out from the Risdon Iron Works to rem
edy that defect. The Tacoma will prob
ably get away with the first tide to-day.
The present terminus of the Market
street railway if to be moved to the front
of the main entrance of the new ferry
depot This was uecidod upon at a meet
ing of the Harbor Commissioners yester
day This will do away with the present
curve and will carry the cars in a
straight line to the depot. It is also in
tended to condemn the property on the
northwest corner of East and Market
streets, so that the Sacramento-street
cars can also go in a straight line to the
depot and thus do away with that dan
gerous curve.
Escaped From Jail.
Kdwarrt Hums, wno wn n. ow
tence of six months 1 imprisonment in the
County Jail for tlll-tapplng, escaped fn>m
that institution yesterday morning.
Burns was a trusty, and his duty in the
early morning was to remove the prar
bage from the jail to a scavenger s wagon
outside in the alley. Deputies Malloy
and Caliahan were on puard in the alley,
and the usual crowd of sightseers wen;
gathered around the place. Burns took
advantage of the crowd and jumped over
the wagon and ran away, the deputies
pursuing, but the prisoner outfooted them
and escaped in the mazes of the alleys
in that vicinity.
This is the first escape that has taken
place since Jailer Sattler took charge,
and he will spare no effort to recapture
Burns.

DEMOCRATIC
INSURRECTION
IS SPREADING
Still Another Exposure of the
Methods of the "Re
formers."
Pledges Broken by the Whispering Boss in
Order to Further His Own Polit
ical Ambition.
Congressman Magruire Is scheduled to
Arrive in this city Tuesday eveninp. his
business being to attach the Demo
cratic party as a tall to his Populist
kite. He will be honored with a rous
ing reception upon his arrival and an
other rousing reception when he at
tempts to make connections between
the tail and the kite at Sacramento on
the opening, day of the Democratic
State convention.
It is this second reception that is
worrying the friends of the Congress
man. They have been so foolish as to
place their fortunes and that of their
standard-bearer !n the hands of Mc-
Nnb. Alford and Gould, the hand-made
Ijospos and evergreen reformers of the
Democratic party, and they now find
that the trio are not on speaking terms
with the honest members of the party,
hence the anticipated reception to
â which reference has been made.
The published statements of W. W.
Foote. M. F. Tarpey, H. T. Fortman,
Francis J. Heney and other prominent
gentlemen who are recognized as the
representatives of the best elements in
â¢the Democratic party have had the ef
lect of swelling the rising tide of indig
jiution against the men who stole con
trol of the local Democracy and are
r.""-v attempting: to deliver the party in
.the State into the- hands of the Popu
lists. The methods that have been
adopted to effect this transfer are such
bring disgrace to the party. Those
v. h> have taken up arms against this
corrupt use of stolen power have been
surprised to learn that Alford and
I and McNab have not only met
the P-pulisTs and divided the places
on the State ticket but they have ar
perfect their title to their
â¢ of the spoils hy calling a con
â¢yentlon for which they have selected
a chairman, named committees and
made such other settlements as will in
the adoption of their cut-and
dried programme, as well as the nam
ine of twenty members of the new
Central Committee, who will be
.; in perfecting their title In fee
simple to the Democratic party in this
State for all time to come. It is be
the discovery of these things
that Mr. Foote and Mr. Tarpey and a
: hundred other old-line Democrats
who are of their way of thinking will
| Tli.- convention in a body and
Inaugurate a demonstration that will
make congressman Maguire's recep
tion next Tuesday night look like ten
in Confederate script. In doing
y have been assured of the moral
:t <>f three-fourths of the Demo
cratic voters in the State outside of
Ban Francisco, and ninety-nine one
hnndredtha of the Democratic voters
in this city.
The facts concerning the manner in
which the control of the local Democ
racy was stolen by the ruling power
tn'.the State Committee, of which Mo-
Nab, Gould and Alford are the guiding
spirits, have leaded out in spite of the
of Becrfecy that bound all of the
member^ of the committee of nine ap
pointed to carry out the wishes of the
Whispering Boss and his associates.
It was this committee that appointed
the committee of one hundred and set
It up as the governing body of the
Democratic party of San Francisco.
The existence of the committee of one
hundred ia a self evident fact, but it
may be of interest to the men who
â¢ robbed of their birthrights to
fcnow the proceedings by which the
transfer was made. It will at least
thrbw some light on the methods of
the Whispering Boss, who has ordered
that the voters of his party shall have
titr voice in the selection of the men
who are to represent them at the State
convention.
. All of the sessions of the committee
of nine were executive, and the mem-
>era were required to pledge them
telves to secrecy as to all proceedings.
A.fter the Harney and Sullivan wings
>'f.-the local Democracy had presented
their claims to recognition as the legal
governing body of the party in this
Slty the committee closed the doors of
:he meeting-room to all comers and
jegan its deliberations. It soon de
veloped that McNab had control of
:he ' majority of the committee and
:hat he intended to use his power. He
leclared that he was in favor of ignor
n'g both contending factions and ap
pointing a new governing body to be
â¢omposed of one hundred members to
Â»c named by the committee of nine.
' This plan was opposed by the minority
jof the committee, which was led by
Governor Budd and Robert M. Fitzger
ald. Though McNab and his followers
held the majority of the committee,
| they found their game blocked by the
minority, which threatened to present
a minority report to the State Com
mittee. As such a course would ex
pose the scheme of McNab to gain con
trol of the local Democracy and might
result in its defeat by the State Com
mittee, the Whispering Boss changed
his tactics. He agreed to make every
j reasonable concession to the minority
â  provided each member of the commit
tee would bind himself to join In mak
ing a unanimous report to the State
Committee. It was here that the mi-
THE SERPENT TEMPTED HER.
nority, which seemed to have the in
terests of the voters at heart, was
jobbed.
Before subscribing to the unanimous
report proposition the minority in
sisted that if a new governing body,
to be composed of one hundred mem
bers, was to be appointed the said gov
erning body should be instructed and
required to hold primaries for the elec
tion of delegates to the State and
municipal conventions. This, they con
tended, would protect the voters, as it
would give them an opportunity of ex
pressing their wishes regardless of any
combination that might be made in
the proposed committee of one hundred,
A long -wrangle followed which was
Gilded by McNab and his followers
agreeing to the primai-y election
stipulation of the minority. This
point having been settled the minority
agreed to the stipulation regarding the
presentation of a unanimous report to
the State Committee. The subject mat
ter of this report, which was signed by
i every member of the committee, is
I familiar to all. It should be understood,
, however, that the task of instructing
i the newly appointed committee of
one hundred of the primary election
stipulation was delegated to McNab,
who was to advocate the holding of
district club primaries on a plan
which, he detailed to the committee
and which, was approved and agreed
to.
The manner in which he carried out his
pledges makes a very short story.
When the comr-Jttee of one hundred
met and perfected organization a com
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 6, 1898.
mittee on district organization was ap
pointed, Sammy Braunhart being
named as chairman. Braunhart Is Mc-
Nab's lieutenant and Max Popper's
Man Friday. When this action was
taken the members of the committee
of nine presumed that it was the first
step toward the holding of district club
primaries. If it was the first step it
was the only one. Braunhart's com
mittee has never taken any action, has
never made a report and has now gone
out of existence. Instead of inform
ing the committee of one hundred
that it was required to hold pri
maries McNab issued ordert for the
selection of delegates by appoint
ment.
Such is the secret history of the ap
pointment of the present governing
body of the local Democracy.
The sequel is yet to be told. Mc-
Nab's reasons for ignoring all pledges
are that he was fearful of losing his
newly acquired power, and a desire to
secure for himself the nomination for
Congressman from the Fourth District.
He was well aware that delegates
elected at a primary would ignore his
ambition to become a statesman. He
therefore issued orders that the dele
gates be selected by appointment, he
reserving to himself the right to name
the men to be appointed by such mem
bers of the committee of one hundred
as he controls â that Is to say the ma
jority of the committee. There are 153
delegates to be appointed. Each mem
ber of the committee has the appoint
ment of one delegate and fifty-three are
to be appointed by the committee act
ing aa a body. If McNab can carry
out his plan to have these fifty-three
delegates named from the list of
names he has prepared he will then
have a majority of the delegation and
will be in a position to order his own
nomination in the Fourth District.
He will also be able to vote the dele-
gation in the State Convention when
the time arrives for him and his as
sociates to force the Democrats of the
State to swallow the fusion pill.
HARNEY DEMOCRATS
NOMINATE DELEGATES
Muster Roll of Those Who Will
Fight for Recognition at

oversaiiguine about breaking into the
State convention, but they intond to make
a hard fight, nevertheless. After the Sac

paign against the exclusive triumvirate

DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES
AT LENGTH NAMED
County Committeemen Name
Their Selections for the
State Convention.
The Democratic City and County Com-
mittee of one hundred met Lost night in
Native Sons' Hall and named delegates
to the State Convention. Kaoh member
of the committee was allowed to name
one delegate. The remaining fifty-four
will l>p nominated at a meeting to b*e
held to-night In the same hall, and the
election will be held on Monday night.
It was determined that the committee
will appoint delegates at the next meet
ing where members have failed to avail
themselves of the privilege up to that
time. Delegate Heeney was opposed to
the motion, on the ground that the right
of nominating was vested in the mem
bers and could not be taken from them.
It was found that inadvertently 158
delegates had been provided for. whereas
only 154 were allowed. As the latter was
the proper proportion, a vote was passed
to that effect.
Francis J. Heeney introduced a reso
lution, which was accepted without de
bate, to the effect that James D. Phelan
be made a delegate at large to the State
Convention. The suggestion that went
with it was to the effect that he be made
chairman of the delegation.
Barnr-y MnKenna named A. J. Clunle as
his representative in the Thirty-sixth Dis
trict. The nomination was opposed by
Max Popper on the ground that Mr.
Clunie was an officeholder and therefore
not eligible. Mr. McKenna in support of
his nomination cited the case of Mayor
Phelan, who had been previously named
as delegate at large. Chairman John P.
Dunn ruled that the law which read "no
clerk or deputy shall be eligible." did not
apply to Mr. Clunie. The ruling was re
ceived with applause.
A long discussion ensued over the propo
sition that the committee receive nomina
tion from the fifty-four men whe are to
be elected at large. Barry, Braunhart,
McCarthy and Popper and others con
tributed to the discussion, which resulted
In- the nominations going over until to
night. Efforts to reopen the question
were quelled by adjournment. The dele

ENCOURAGEMENT FOR
THE TRUTH SOCIETY
LEAGUE OF THE CROSS ENTER-
TAINMENT A SUCCESS.
Metropolitan Temple Crowded With
a Large Audience â An Inter
esting and Entertaining
Programme Given.
The entertainment given at Metropoli
tan Temple last evening by the League
of the Cross Cadets for the benefit of the
ladles of . the Catholic Truth Society
proved a success far beyond the most
sanguine expectations of those directly In
chargÂ«. The hall was crowded to its ut
most capacity. People unable to procure
seats crowded the aisles and blocked the
passages leading to the entrance.
The programme of the evening com
prised many Interesting and instructive
selections by many well-known profes
sional singers and actors. Among the
number were Elvia Seabrooke and Wil
liam Pruette of the Tivoll Opera-house
and many other well-known actresses and
actors. One of the most attractive feat
ures was a number of comic songs and
recitations by William J. Hynes, the
well-known comedian. An eloquent ad
dress upon the subject of "Patriotism."
was delivered by John J. Barrett. In it
he outlined and defined civil government
speaking of it as divine in Itself as the
soul of man and obligatory and binding
as moral law. He drew a well-defined
parallel of the patriotism of the people
of the United States and the people of
other nations. He characterized it as one
of the paramount traits of every Ameri
can citizen, emphasizing this fact by the
heroic sacrifice that our volunteer sol
diers are now making in defense of the
principles of liberty and tolerance in the
present war. The speaker said that when
the war shall have terminated the Ameri
can republic will be under a lasting ob
ligation to the Irish and the Catholic
church.
This claim, he stated, was based upon
the blood of Catholics and Irishmen hun
dreds of whom have perished for the
nation since the war was declared; and to
the ladies of the Catholic Truth Society
who have worked bo indefatigably in al
leviating the sufferings and privations of
the soldiers. In conclusion he reviewed
the policy of the nation and spoke of the
war as the great and stupendous proof
that the Government of this country 's
based on the greatest of all powers of
complete unionâ that of patriotism.

Beck is the salad-maker, and yesterday

head and face with some dishes. Beck
was arrested.

IT PAYS TO FIGHT.
Important Concessions Made to Man-
ufacturers by the Railroad
Combine.
Several months ago the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association made a strong
fight against the railroads' discrimination
against the manufacturers of this coast
in allowing the jobbers of the East rates
on manufactured articles that killed lo
cal competition. Many conferences, were
held, and a representative was sent to the
recent convention of railroad men, .which
resulted in several important concessions
being made in favor of the West. That
it sometimes pay to fight, even when the
opponent is a big railroad corporation, is
shown by the following letter, which was
received yesterday by the secretary of the
association:
SAX FRANCISCO. July 28, 189 S.
Manufacturers" and Producers' Association,
Mills building', city â Gentlemen: Referring to
our correspondence of some time ago regard
ing: the rate bB leaf tob&CCQ from Dariville,
Va., to San Francisco being just as high as on
the manufactured article, we are glad to say
that the railroad company has now arranged
rates satisfactory to us, the charges being but
$1 50 on the ra?r material, against $2 20 OB the
manufactured article. As we believe- this ia
due entirely to your efforts we herewltti tKg
t'j thank you for giving this matter such
prompt attention. Very truly yours.
