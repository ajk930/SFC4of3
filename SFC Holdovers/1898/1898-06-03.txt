DRAWING CLOSER THE
FATAL NET ABOUT CERVERA
WILL BE
SUNK OR
CRUSHED
Rushing the Preparations
for the Work of
Invasion.
Three. Great Armies Are Being
Formed for Santiago, San
Juan and Havana.
CALL OFFICE, Riggs House,
Washington, June 2.
The War Department is now rushing
preparations with all speed for the invasion
of Spanish territory by three American
armies. The first will go to Santiago, the
second to Porto Rico and the third to the
western end of Cuba, with an ultimate view
to an attack upon Havana.
The advance guard of the Santiago
expedition, consisting of an engineer
corps and artillery experts, supported
by a .small body of regular troops, is
perhaps even now on the water. The
Porto Rico expedition, it is believed,
â vill leave for San Juan in a few days,
while tiie troops that are to be used
against Havana may hot be embarked
for several weeks^
The keenest interest has been ex
cited here over the expedition to San
tiago, and every effort is being made
to hasten the departure of a force large
enough to take the city without rely
ing upon the co-operation of the in
surgents, 3000 of whom, according to a
];Â»te press report, are now gathering
i:i the hills preparatory to an attack
uppn the earthworks thrown up by the
Spanish soldiers for the defense pf the
city and Admiral Cervera's fleet.
The operations of the American land
and naval forces in the coming siege
of Santiago will constitute a notable
episode in modern warfare.
The Navy Department is informed
that Admiral Sampson is now off the
harbor, where he has relieved Commo
dore Sqhley of the supreme command
of the fleet, and is preparing to. destroy
the Spanish ships as soon as they ven
ture forth. That they will be driven
out of the harbor the artillery experts
of the War Department do riot hesitate
to predict.
The expedition to Santiago will carry
the heaviest siege guns in the artillery
equipment of .the United States, and
with these terrible engines the Span
ish forces have nothing that can cope.
These guns can be fully protected in
the hills about Santiago; and under the
practice of the American artillery ser
vice, a terrific plunging fir 4 can be di
rected upon the decks of Cervera's
fleet that will sink his ships unless he
steams out of the harbor, where Ad
miral Sampson is waiting to receive
him. " ' â 
The guns of the Spanish fleet cannot
be fired at a sufficient elevation to in
terfere In the slightest "with the opera
tions of the American siege guns, and
as the harbor in front of Santiago is
â¢ only about two miles wide and very
shallow, the Spanish admiral will be
forced to. .choose ' between seeing his
ships sent td the bottom without an
opportunity to reply to the American
fire, and steaming boldly forth to do
battle with Sampson's armorclads. In
â¢the speculation here as to Cervera's
probable course the best opinion is
uanimous that he will fight his ships
even at .heavy odds rather than see
them go down In the mud of Santiago
harbor. i .
It is probable that the expedition to
Santiago will sail by way of the Wind
ward Passage, which is the regular
steamer .track to the southern coast
from Havana and Key West. The
force will be landed about thirty miles
east- of Santiago, not far from the Bay
of Guantanamo, which is an excellent
harbor. Thence a road leads to the
city of Guantanamo, w,hich is now in
the possession of the insurgents, and
where the American forces â  will be
joined by Â«â  considerable detachment of
General Garcia's army that will un
doubtedly prove useful in guarding the
cordon to be drawn around Santiago
When the siege of that city is formally
undertaken.
The surprise so generally expressed
that the Navy Department has re
ceived r.o word from Commodore Schley
v.-iiii regard to the bombardment .of
the defenscc of Santiago is not shared
by the more experienced naval officers
The San Francisco Call
here. They believe that both Sampson
and Schley will avoid cable stations as
i much as possible, and will only report
t.Â» the department when it seems abso
lutely necessary for the welfare of the
cause to do so. â 
The Board of Strategy is not now
engaged in giving detailed instructions
t" "\ir fleet in Cuban waters, but it for
wards a dally cable to several points
in the West Indies conveying all in
formation gathered during the preced
ing twenty-fo-ur hours, and experience
has shown that these advices are occa
sionally misleading.
As a naval veteran remarked to-day,
"Little news need be expected from
our fleets until so .ething has been
done worth reporting.' 1
But while operations in the east are
attracting the chief attention, the sit
uation in the Philippines is not being
neglected. The Navy Department to
day sent an urgent telegram to the
commandant Cff the Mare Island Navy
Yard instructing him to make ready
to rush all necessary repairs, on the
Monadnock upon her arrival at San
Francisco, whither she has been or
dered from Puget Sound. This formid
able vessel will start for Manila at the
earliest possible date, and upon her ar
rival Admiral Dewey will find himself
in command of a squadron fully cap
able of destroying the somewhat vis
ionary "Cadiz fleet" should the Span
ish Government decide to send it east
ward through Suez canal.
In this connection the advocates of
the annexation of the Hawaiian Isl
ands, who are now moving heaven and
earth to secure the. passage of New
lands' resolution,, realizing that if an
nexation can not be secured in time of
war it certainly must i II in time of
peace, are making a desperate effort
to overcome Speaker Reed's sturdy op
position. They now. declare that Reed
has been induced to withdraw his ob
jection to a special order for the con
sideration of the resolution, and that
it will be passed by a large majority.
The evident anxiety of the advocates
of annexation, however, la the best evi
dence that they are not confident of a
satisfactory outcome for the present
agitation.
WAITING FOR THE
DYNAMITE CRUISER.
The Vesuvius to Go to the As
sistance of Sampson and
Schley.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 2.â A dis
patch boat which left Commodore
Schley's fleet two days ago brings the
Interesting information that no com
bined assault will be made on the shore
forts and batteries defending thÂ« en
trance to the harbor of Santiago for
the purpose of forcing an entrance and
getting at Cervera's fleet until the ar
rival of the dynamite cruiser Vesuvius.
The Vesuvius has been doing scout
duty off the western end of Cuba.
When she arrives off Santjago her
dynamite guns will be tested in an ef
fort to explode rows of mines which are
known to have been planted across the
harbor's mouth. :
The dynamite shells the Vesuvius
hurls will upon explosion. It. is claimed,
explode by concussion any mine with
in 300 yards of/the point at which the
dynamite shell strikes.
The Vesuvius' guns, are however,
capable of effective work only at a dis
tance of a-out three-quarters of a mile,
and hence the reduction of the defenses
that mieht oppose her in her task is
necessary. It was this work which the
lowa. Massachusetts and New Orlenas
began on Tuesday last, and which It is
believed the combined fleets of Samp
eon and Schiey will resume.

INCREASE
OF DEFENSES
AT MANILA
The Harbor to Be Made Im
pregnable Against Span
ish Attack.
Monitors Monterey and Monad
nock to Be Placed Back of
Some Large Mines.
NEW YORK, June 2.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Effective measures taken by the ad
ministration will shortly render Manila
harbor impregnable against Spanish
attack. In connection with the de
fenses of that harbor I learned to-day
that the City of Peking carried with
her to the far East a large number of
â¢mines, containing fifty pounds of gun
cotton, of the same character as those
which were sent to the North Atlantic
squadron at the request of Rear Ad
miral Sampson. Back of these mines
will be placed the monitors Monterey
and Monadnock, which will shortly
start for the far East in tow of colliers,
and there is good reason to believe that
Rear Admiral Dewey's force will be
supplemented in the near future by the
gunboat Bennington.
There is talk in the Navy Department
of relieving the cruiser Olympia, the
flagship of the Asiatic squadron, and
bringing her home. This action was
contemplated just before the war broke
out on account of the condition of her
machinery, and that she has done good
work is evidenced by the battle of Ma
nila bay. The Olympia will probably
be ordered home during the latter part
of the summer, provided Spain's re
serve squadron is not sent to the east.
In withdrawing the Bennington from
Hawaii it is not proposed to leave this
Government without an adequate na
val representation In those waters.
The training ship Mohican, now at
Honolulu, and the Pensacola, which
has just been completed at Mare Island
navy yard and is now in commission,
will also be probably sent to that point.
The dispatch of the Monterey and
Monadnook to the far East will leave
the Pacific Coast With but the Phila
drlphia and Yorktown to provide it
with protection. The Philadelphia will
be placed in commission on July 1. The
Ynrktown will not be completed .before
fall. On account of the distance to the
Pacific Slope from Spain, the Naval
War Board does not expect that Spain
will send any ships to that section ex
cept via Suez Canal, in which event
they would first encounter Rear Ad
miral Dcwey's squadron. In view of
the large force being collected at Ma
nila and the precautions being taken by
this Government to protect the bay, it
is not bplieved that Spain will send her
squadron east, but if they move at all
it will be to the West Indies.-

OTIS' CONFIRMATION
MAY BE DEFEATED.
LOS ANGELES, June. 2.âAd
vices received here this evening,
fmm Washington indicate that
Colonel Harrison Gray Otis, edi
tor of the Times, will not .be con
firmed by the United States
Senate as brigadier - general. .
Ever since Otis' name was sent
into. the Senate labor organiza
tions of this city have been ap-i
pealing 1 to their affiliated organ
izations throughout the country,
asking that the Senate Commit
tee on Military. Affairs.be ap
pealed to to retire Colonel Otis..
Very urgent requests have been
made by Colonel Otis' friends
here of prominent labor leaders,
asking them to let up on their
fight on Otis. The reply to this
appear has been that in all his
editorial career, in this city Otis
never has manifested the slight
est' feeling in hi 3 treatment for
men. . .
"He has never at any time let
up on anybody," say the labor
leaders, "and we dp. not propose
to let up on him,, but will fight
him to the bitter end. We have
received advices . which encour
age us. very much,' and. we are
still at work. Otis will never.be
a brigadier-general with our:
consent. . â¢ â¢ ' .'
he met General P.alma, the. head of the
Cuban Junta, lie visited Cuban head
quarters. Questioned- as to the strength
of the army, he said: â  " . â¢ .
"Not .counting those who have re
cently joined his forces, Garcia has
about 12,000 men- under him in the east
ern department at Santiago- and Porto
Principe. About 35Q0 of these men were
in the neighborhood of Santiago- when
I last received word. All were fully
armed and equipped, and it was the in
tention to concentrate all of the force
in the eastern portion to that- point. .
I cannot tell definitely how many men
there are in the other provinces. Gomez
has about 5000 men at Santa .Clara.
Probably 3.0,000 men, all fully armed
and equipped, are in the ranks of. the
Cuban army. A large number, prob
ably 20,000 more, are armed with ma
chetes, and there are thousands of oth
ers who have recently left the towns to
join the r my because they couJd no
longer live in the towns. From Porto
Principe alone 10,000 men and women
have left because of the scarcity of
provisions, preferring to take their
chances in the country, and further in
fluenced by the fear that at the last
moment the Spaniards, driven to de
spair, will, out of revenge, reaort to
slaughter." ,

LONDON, June 3.â Count de Rascon,
the Spanish Embassador In London,
â who has been interviewed on the sub
ject, admitted that war means ruin for
Spain, and he said: "The sentiment is

able peace, which America, considering
her unpreparedness for a war of Inva

to a protracted struggle. Involving
heavy sacrifices of money and men.

.Yesterday's news and that which
comes this morning has brought no
fresh feature in the Bituation except
increase the mystification as to wheth
er Admiral Cervera is really at Santi
ago de Cuba. The Madrid correspond
dehta of the morning papers make the
point that the persistence with â >!eh
Senor Sagasta and Captain Aunon, the
Minister of Marine, assert Cervera's
presence there is a mere attempt to
mislead the enemy. On tiie other hand,
it is argued that Admiral Cervera
could not be in a safer place, and that
if Admiral Camara could succeed in en
tering another western harbor, thus
employing two American squadrons in
the work of blockading, Spain's policy
of delay would be assisted. But for the
negative evidence that Admiral Cer-
Vera has not been seen elsewhere, Lon
don opinion leans to the theory that he
escaped from Santiago harbor i either
before Sunday or possibly under cover
of the torpedo maneuvers Sunday rrigr.t.
In any case, it is said that Admiral
Btunpaon will soon take steps to solve,
the mystery finally so far as Santiago
is concerned.^
With regard to the report of Euro
pean intervention, the Vienna corre-.
Bpondents of berth the Daily Chronicle
and Daily News deny that the Austri
en Government has received any fresh
communication from Spain. It would
appear, therefore, that any efforts in
this direction are being made only in
France, where they are apparently
the most likely to succeed/
It is understood that M. H&notaux
and other Ministers regard the present
situation as intolerable. Protracted
war, besides destroying commerce,
would. necessitate postponing the com
ing exposition. It is hoped that the
r.ew commercial agreement between
France and . the United States will
smooth the way to French intervention,
in which, certainly, Austria and per
haps England or other powers will Join.
Russia, it is asserted, would be willing,
to undertake the office of mediator to
save France the necessity of becoming
prominent.. â â¢.:â¢:""â  !. . â¢

GERMANY TO BE
STRICTLY NEUTRAL
NEW YORK, June 2. â A Washington special to the
Herald says: Embassador White has informed the State De
partment of an interview had with Herr yon Bulo'w, Imperial
Secretary of Foreign Affairs for Germany, in which the latter
said Germany intended to adhere strictly to neutrality in the
present war, stating the failure to issue a proclamation of
neutrality was not significant owing to the fact that Germany
never issues such proclamations. Embassador White was
also assured that while many Germans sympathized with
Spain owing to her weakness, the great body of the people are
friendly to the United States.
The department recognizes this as one of the most im
portant utterances which has come from Europe since the
beginning of hostilities. . . <

NOW VEERING
Berlin's Leading Writers
on the War.
TAKE THE SIDE OF PROGRESS
HOPE TO SEE UNCLE SAM A
WINNER.
BelUve This Conflict Will Force
America to Become a Military
Nation After the European
Pattern.
BERLIN, June 2.â 1 have just suc
ceeded in booking a further big block
of German public opinion for the in
formation of readers of the Herald.
The Vossisje Zeitung's editor says:
"Of course we are on the side of pro
gress. Thus we cannot help wishing
the United States success in the main,
hoping they may put an end to the mis
erable state of affairs in Cuba, but we
should not be sorry to see the Yankees
receive a couple of "denkzettin" (sharp
souvenirs), let us say, first. As for the
question of the future of the Philip
pines, that is a serious matter, but it is
still in a state of liquefaction."
The next authority I consulted was
the editor of the Berliner Neusten Nac
richten, the well known Bismarckian
organ of Berlin, who said: "This is
serious business. Its first effect has
been to interfere with commerce all
over the world. From the point of view
of a dispassionate outsider I look on
the declaration of war by the United
States as trespassing on the sphere of
power of European monarchies. If the
United States gain the day promptly,
they will turn longing eyes after time
toward the West Indian Islands and
Canada."
The Berliner Tageblatt is too well
known abroad for it to be necessary
to dwell at length on its special char
acteristics as one of the most enter
prising of German newspapers.. Here
is what I was told by the editor: "In
politics, or rather in popular interest in
politics,- two currents are invariably to
be detected. One voices the heart, or
what we call sentiment, and the other
is the outcome of common sense, self
interest or calculation. In Germany
calculation decides our leanings in
matters of foreign policy. As a matter
of faqt it was Bismarck who brought
us to see things thus in a dispassionate
light. . â¢-..â â 
"But all this does not prevent oar
seeing and noting the regrettable frivol
ity with which the United States
plunged into a war, to wage which thoy
are entirely unprepared. Further, we
believe that in consequence of this very
war, America will be forced to becomo
a military nation after European pat
tern, for neither her militia nor peace
navy has proved equal to the strain.'
BISMARCK HAS NOT
BEEN INTERVIEWED.
Son-in-Law of the Prince Denies a

BERLIN, June 2.â Count Rentzau,
son-in-law of Prince Bismarck, has au
thorized me to use the following un
equivocal denial of statements attrib
ute! to the Prince. From it both the
remarks and views contained in an al
leged interview with the former Chan
cellor will be found to be absolutely
baseless.
"My father-in-law has not seen any
journalist whatever for months past.
Neither has he spoken to anybody
about Spanish-American war. (Signed)
Rantzau."
This letter effectually disposes of all
theories that have been built on views
of Prince Bismarck, seeing he has not
expressed any.

Commodores Who Are Seniors
Compelled to Report to a JuQior
Acting Rear Admiral.
NEW YORK, June 2.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
The friends of Commodore W. S. Schley
are indignant to-day at the apparent
disparagement by the Navy Depart
ment of that officer's ability and trust
worthiness in superseding him in. the
chief command of the American naval
forces of Santiago de Cuba. Rear-Ad
miral Sampson has arrived off that
harbor, and while he flies the rear
admiral's flag, and Commodore Schley
flies that of a commodore, the latter of
ficer is in command of a division of the
fleet, while Rear-Admiral Sampson has
charge of the entire fleet and has au
thority alone to direct its movements.
According to the friends of Commo
dore Schley this is rather rough on that
officer, for the reason that Rear-Ad
miral Sampson is acting under what is
termed in the navy "a gunboat com
mission"âthat, is he was appointed as
acting rear-admiral by the President â
while Commodore Sen-ley's rank is that
of commodore by virtue of the Pres
ident's commission. ... '
Commodore Schley Is on the naval
register as Acting Admiral Sampson's
senior by two numbers. After having

Special Dispatch to The Call.
. OMAHA, â  Neb.; June 2.â The. official
Investigation of the muddle in which it
is claimed that the Pacific Express
Company has lost $200,000 through the
connivance of some of its chief officials,
commenced in earnest to-day.
It was the preliminary hearing of
Hon., W. F. Bechel. of Omaha. The
charge against Mr. Bechel was that he
embezzled : $3000 of the company's
money. For the past fifteen years
Bechel was chief auditor of the com
pany. His assistant was T. K. Sudbor
ough, who is under arrest under a simi
lar charge. Andrew Hunt, chief clerk
to President Morsenian, is out on a
bond for a similar complicity. Morse
man has not been charged formally
with criminal connection with the
affair though permitted to resign his
office along with Mr. Bechel some time
.'.since. â¢ . ....â  ; ? .
The case was opened by tn> State
putting W. E. Nason on the staid. He
j has. been chief; bookkeeper of the com
pany for many years. His testimony
. was* that since 1883 the Pacific Express
â¢Company had. paid about $10,000 a year
toward influencing logislation at Lin
coln. He said this money was usually
drawn on the order of the President at
1 St. Louis every year in instalments of
f from $3Â«00; to .SSOOO at a time. To make
â¢ his books balance he was instructed
by the head/officials to force a balance.

On the other hand the officials say in
; dispatching Rear Admiral Sampsom to
Santiago there was no intention to dis
parage the ability and trustworthiness
of Commodore Schley. It was desired
; to crush the Spanish fleet without risk
j ing any of the men or the armorelads,
' and it was therefore deemed advisable
! by the Naval War board to strongl}
| reinforce the fleet off Santiago. Ac
cordingly Rear Admiral Sampson, with
! the New York, Oregon, Mayflower and
Porter was ordered from Key West to
Santiago. Besides, it was pointed out
that Commodore George Remey, in
charge of the naval base at Key West,
and Commodore Watson, commander
in-chief of the blockading squadron,
are not only Acting Rear Admiral
Sampson's seniors by virtue of their
commissions., but of Commodore Schley,
1 and they have been compelled to report
I to Admiral Sampson a^nd obey his mi
i structions. : V
When Commodore Schley met the
rear admiral at Key West Just before
he left for the south coast of Cuba, he
reported to him as coinmarider-in-chief
of the American forces in North At
lantic waters, and. was. by that action
: placed under his command. To make
j it certain that there should be no mis
j take on this point the flying squadron,
as Commodore Schle'y's command was
I then known, was formally assigned to
I the North Atlantic squadron.

of his wagon got jammed against the
curbstone in such a way that the;
horses pulled at a disadvantage. Van-:

balked; The man's; curses called Crane, m
who lived across the street, to his win- : ;
dow. Vaning was then engaged in:
trying to pull the horses ; along by the
sars, and already had the robe hitched;
around one animal's tongue. Before :
Mr. Crane could say a word; in expos- i
tulatton, Vaning grasped the rope, and:
with a succession of savage tugs pulled
the horse's, tongue out of its mouth by
the roots. .' .'.-. -â¢â  .. â  â ;;' ' '

DEFICIENCY
BILL PASSED
Provides for Emergency
Expenses.
BASED UPON ESTIMATES
CARRIES ITEMS FOR CUBA AND
PHILIPPINE TROOPS.
Should the War Continue One Year
Cannon Says It Will Cost Uncle
Sam Six Hundred Mil
lion. Dollars.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
; Â Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June. 2.
The House, practically without de
bate, passed to-day the urgency ; de
ficiency bill, providing for emergency
expenses of the army and navy depart
ments, incident to war. It was based
upon estimates received recently from
the departments, and carries Items
. contemplated In the Philippine expedi
tion and the early movements upon
Cuba. . â¢ . .
In committee of the whole Cannon ex
plained the presentation of the measure.
He said it was the policy of the Commit
tee on Appropriations to hold back the
general deficiency bill until practically
the close of the session-, in order to catch
u.p all items that may develop as neces-.
â sary up to the latest moment of the ses
sion. Meantime the present bill was
Urgent, and had been reported for present
consideration because its items could not
wait upon the. general deficiency bill. In
cidentally he estimated . the appropria
tions already-made on account of the war
and likely to develop as essential, in-
I eluding the first six months of the com
i ing fiscal year, at $350,000;000. .In response
! to a question from Dlngley, Cannon said
i- that the war would ' cost approximately
-$600,000,000, provided it should continue
A suggestion from Fitzgerald (D.) of
Massachusetts that cooJss be provided
for the .troops at Camp Alger precipitated
a discussion upon the conditions which'
exist there. Such veterans as Grosvenor.
Cannon and LlvingstoD of Georgia- dis
coursed upon the necessities of soldiers
undergoing in the process of hardening
what seemed grave hardships compared
with conditions to which they were ac
customed at home. They dre"w compari
sons between present conditions and
those existing In the Civil War, .showine
that present provisions are better.
Games- (D.) of Tennessee vigorously
criticised the War Department for allow
ing but seven days in which to receive
bids for supplies. He paid grave injus
tice was being done the South, and nota
bly Tennessee, in discriminating in. favor
of manufacturers of other sections.
"The main thine: before us now is to
pass this bill." declared Cannon. "The
money cannot be spent until appropri
ated. Some gentlemen come here and cry
out and complain because in a twinkling
an army, fully equipped with tents, uni
forms, provisions, guns and everything
for comfort, is not ready now, and now
here comes the cyclone from Tennessee
anil says, 'My God, you don't give us but
seven days to btd.' "
The reading of the bill at length pro
ceeded and ii was passed unanimously
without further debate.
A number of bills affecting the District
of Columbia were passed, and at 1:52
o'clock the House adjourned.

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, June 2.â Marie
Cicote Wilson, the California beauty
who has made her home in both Los

leased to-day from the workhouse at

Hers is a remarkable history, She
claims to have been married four or i
five years ago to H. J. Burroughs, an
auctioneer widely known over the Uni
ted States. Burroughs denies the alle
gation with as much vigor as she as
serts its truth. The woman has fol
lowed him from one end of the conti
nent to the other, starting from Los
Angeles three years ago, and has got
into trouble at several places on ac
count of her unusual demonstrations
toward him. At Cincinnati she was ,
locked up on a charge of perjury pre- I
f erred, by Burroughs. She created {
scene after scene in court by denounc- I
ing everybody connected with the case, j
including the Judge, and when sent to '!
jail for a few. days refused to eat.
She was finally acquitted at Cincin- |
hati, whence, accompanied by her I
mother, she went to Fremont, Ohio,
where Burroughs' mother lived. With
out ' introduction, she baked into the j
house and announced her intention of j
living there: She was arrested on a â¢
charge of assault, and the Mayor of. ;
Fremont fined her, and sent her, along 1
with her mother, to the workhouse.
She now says she will sue the city ot
Fremont for heavy damages for falst
imprisonment. She will shortly return
to California.
RACING ON BRONCHOS
TO SAN FRANCISCO
Three Young Englishmen Start From
Vancouver on a "Unique
Wager.
VANCOUVER, June 2. -Three rich
young Englishmen from Manchester-
Allan Ramsay, W. Blocklock Lees and
H. J. K. Lawless-^started from here on
a unique wager to-day. It Is to race to
San Francisco on bronchos. From this
city they will all; go to New Westminster,
thence to Elaine. Seattle and Portland
arid south through Oregon and California
to San Francisco, a distance of about 1300
miles. They expect to reach their desti
nation in about ten weeks.
The race is more for amusement than
anything else, as the wager is that the
last man to arrive at San Francisco must
entertain the others at a banquet to cost
not less than X'OO. After meeting in San
Francisco they will go to Peru and engage
in various pursuits where openings for
capital are offered. They intended going
to the Klondike, but thought Peru a
better stamping ground. All are sons of
millionaires. . â  ' ; .

they taken Havana? Not one ?un

would mean their destruction. Yan

When the Senate adjourned this
evening the war revenue measure, so

cerned, was completed, with the ex
ception of the bond .provision and the
aiTiendments proposed by the Demo
crats in lieu of the bond' paragraph.:

of the measure; announced he would
as)c the Senate to remain in session to
morrow until a vote Was reached. ;..
When the consideration of the- war rev-,
eiiue bill was resumed. Butler (lop.) of
:Ni>rth Carolina undressed the Senate. He
regretted that the Finance committee
luid not seen: fit to present to the. Senate,
a: genuine revenue bill! In the circum
starw.es the responsibility for delay In
ttie passage of the pending 'measure, rests,
said he, upon those who have placed In
the bill provisions that have no place In
a revenue measure. He expressed his re
â gf/eis that those holding peculiar views
oii the money question had seen fit to
raise those controverted questions or.
finance incorporated in the measure as
it forced those who differed from the
committee on those, questions to discuss

Unger (R.i of New â¢â Hampshire, who de
manded that Butler make his charges

In the course. of a colloquy between the
two Senators Butler declared that im
in. use sums had been contributed to the
Republican Presidential campaign. : fund.
by trusts a-nd monopolists and . bond
holders and money changers, and that
<<â¢â¢> ix-r cent of the money had been raised
and paid over to the Republican party
under a contract that certain legislation
promoting, the interests of the trusts and
monopolies should be enacted. â  . : j
Galiinger insisted that the charges
should be made specific, that Butler had
no right under the rules to arraign him
or his party unless he had definite and
specific 'charged to present. .
Kyle (Pop.) of South Dakota also in
sisted that Butler give his- authority for
such assertions. Kyle stated that as the
chairman of the Populist party Butlei
h;iil made a charge that was at least ex
travagant, anfi that in making such
statements as the representative of the
iVpulist party the Senator ought to. be
Certain of his position before making
them. . â¢â :'â¢..'-'
Butler said that while he believed the
statement to be true, he had not made it
upon his own responsibility with per
sonal knowledge of its truth. . "I have,
learned," s.aid ne, "in the course of my
experience : as chairman of the: Populist
party committee, that there are interests
which will contribute to the support of
any party in return for an engagement
that that party will support legislation
favorable to tnose interests." â  v . â '.
Hawley (R.) -of. Connecticut interjected
the remark that he had no doubt that
the Senator (Butler) knew what he was
talking about, but Republican Senators
had not been approached in any such
manner as indicated. â  . . 'â  â  : "â¢ â¢'â 
Gal-linger and . Allen followed: in the

campaign. The former; who is a member
of the committee to audit .'and control the
contingent expenses of the .Senate,, to.
which the resolution was. referred, said'
that he was willing to go into the investi
gation at this time, but no proof had :been
presented to the' committee that that was.
neceÂ£SÂ«U7Â» He pointed out that; the other
two members of the committee had sup- .
ported the .same Presidential candidate in.

Teller (Sil.iÃ.) of Colorado, in the course
of a : brief but emphatic, statement that,

by the people and ought to be investigat
ed by lE* Senate, declared that it was
notorious that the Republican party had
spent more money in the one campaign or
ISSH> than It has speiitinall previous cam
paigns since 1556. He added that no party
had eyer employed methods in . a eam
paiern so corrupt as were: the methods or
the P.epublleari parfy in that campaign,
and that such methods were a menace to
our form of government. He .would be

SAN JOSE, June 2. â At a called meeting of the officers
of the various Grand Army posts this evening the dismissal
of Professor Smith was discussed at great length, and the
following stinging rebuke to the action of the Battlefield
Veterans was adopted :
NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC.
We, the undersigned officers of the Grand Army posts
of the city of San Jose, as representatives of the organization
of which we are officers, hereby notify the public that the
self-styled "Union Battlefield Veterans" is a purely local
political organization and has no connection whatever with
the Graml Army of the Republic; that the great majority of
the members of the Grand Army of the Republic in this
county never have belonged and never will belong to that
organization; that no member of that organization is neces
sarily a member of the Grand Army of the Republic, and
that we are in no way responsible for any of their acts.
We denounce their confessed treatment of Professor
Leigh R. Smith as cowardly and contemptible and in every
way unworthy of any veteran or body of veterans, and we
wish it distinctly understood that the Grand Army of the
Republic had no part nor lot in the whole nefarious pro
ceeding.

D. A. Smith, Senior Vice-Commander of John A. Dix
Post, who signs the article, is the father of the girl who
is reputed to be responsible for the trouble that culminated
in Smith's dismissal. This is clear evidence that the whole
thing was a political job on the part of the Battlefield
Veterans.
SAN JOSE, June 2.â The refusal of
the City Board of Education to re-elect
Professor Leigh R. Smith, the Latin and
Greek teacher In the High School, to
his former position has aroused an In
tense feeling, and a strong wave of
condemnation of the trustees' action
has swept over the city. The High
School pupils are up In arms over the
matter, and back of them are the best
people of the city.
The reason given by the trustees for
their action is that Professor Smith
was reported to be distilling disloyal
f^ntiments into his class, but the peo
ple refuse to look at It in this light, and
back of the whole matter see the
smooth work of politicians. For some
time the "gang" have been awaiting
an opportunity to find an excuse to
displace Smith arid substitute one of
their pets, and that time came Monday
night. But they little thought of the
feeling, their action would cause, or that
the whole people of the city would
rally to Smith's support. As it is, their
move may be balked^ for it is thought
the Board of Education will hardly
dare to oppose the strong current of
popularity that surrounds. . Professor
.Smith. 'â â¢ -.. -"â¢â¢". â 
The whole . matter In Professor
Smith's case seems to be this: His
popularity with the pupils of the school
have aroused the jealousy of the teach
ers; and again the "gang" is anxious
to create a vacancy in the school for
either Ai Kelly of Los Gastos or Elmer
Brownell of- Mountain View-. For some
time these men have been promised
positions in town, and the removal of
Professor Smith is believed to be for
the sole purpose of advancing them.
Then, again, the position held by Pro
fessor Smith is, with the exception of
the principal, the best paying one in
the school. He receives $1800 per year,
while the. other teachers only get $1400.
This, with his popularity, has aroused
thr enmity of the other teachers, and
It is said that a coolness exists between
him and the other members of the fac
ulty, and that at times the latter have
snubbed and.even insulted him.
Mrs. Mary Pillot, a teacher in the
High School, has been taking private
lessons in Latin and Greek from Pro
fessor Smith for several years, and It
i? paid that she will bo given Smith's
place, and Brownell or Kelly will take
her place. This advancement of Mrs.
Pillot will be necessary, because neither
Brownell or Kelly can "teach Latin or
Greek.
Professor Smith was elected to his po
sition about nine years ago. He is a
graduate of Princeton and is considered
'he equal of any Latin and Greek
'eacher on the coast.
Professor Smith declined to discuss
the matter to-day further than to say
he knew no reason why he should be
charred with disloyalty. He said that
he understood that some of the pupils
had misconstrued his remarks. He said
that a couple of weeks ago in the his
tory class he spoke at some length on
the Cuban question. At that time he
stated that if the United States had act
ed more firmly in the Virginiusaffairthe
Spanish would have had more respect
for us, and the present war might have
been averted. He blamed the Govern
ment for accepting a cash indemnity
for those lives and said some more
stringent measure should have been
adopted. This was what he thought
had Induced the Battlefield Veterans
to protest against his election, but
thought this statement had probably
been distorted by some of his pupils..
Professor Shumate, principal of the
High School, stated that he had heard
similar complaints about Professor
Smith's disloyalty, and In order that it
might not happen again he had
changed the lesson so that Professor
Smith would not have time to lecture
on such subjects. He said Professor
Smith was a good teacher and had per
formed his duties satisfactorily.
E. H. Wemple. chairman of the Board
of Education, said he had been told
by the classification committee that
the Battlefield Veterans would prefer
charges against Professor Srdith If he
was re-elected. For this reason they
had not elected him and had postponed
his election until the matter could blow
over. He said no one had been con
sidered for Professor Smith's place anjd
in all probability Professor Smith
would be re-elected.
Clty Superintendent Russell, who is
a member of the classification commit
tee, said that a little girl named Nellie
Smith had told her father, who is a
Battlefield Veteran, that Professor
Smith had spoken disparagingly of
Grant and said that If it had not been
for the Civil War Grant would have
died only a tanner at Galena, 111. Mr.
Russell said Professor Smith probably
made this remark to show his class that
the opportunity created the man. and
not the man the opportunity. He said
the child had probably misunderstood
her teacher and thought he was reflect
ing on the character of Grant. Profes
sor Russell said that the removal of
Professor Smith would be a great loss
to the school. He said there was no
one in the school that could do the
work of Professor Smith, and that it
would be necessary to secure so.ne one
of like qualifications to take his place
if the high standing of the school was
to be maintained.
The Grand Army men are indignant
over the action of the Battlefield Vet
erans, and almost to a man are stand-
Ing with Professor Smith in the mat
ter. They denounce the Battlefield
Veterans as a political organization
that attempts to do the bosses' bid
ding among the old soldiers. L. L.
Nattinger, who is seeking the nomina
tion for Supervisor, and Major Starck,
another politician. Is at the head of the
organization. So obnoxious were their
political Intrigues that a short time ago

A SURPRISE TO HER FRIENDS
ENGAGEMENT NOT EVEN AN
TICIPATED.
Parents of the California Heiress
Consoled by the Fact That
Their Son-in-Law Is a
Worthy Man.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 2.â The many
friends of Miss Maud Northam, the
young CaMfornia heiress, who visited
this city last winter as a member of
Mme. Modjeska's company, were much
surprised to-day to learn that she had
been quietly married on May 11 in
Brooklyn to Thomas M. Reilly, treas
urer of the Modjeska company. Miss
Northam's father, R. J. Northam, is a
prominent and wealthy Californian.
He has large business interests in Los
Angeles and San Francisco and is the
owner of several large ranches, one of
which adjoins that belonging to Mme.
Modjeska.
Being neighbors, the actress and the
Northam family became good friends,
and the young woman finally confided
in Mme. Modjeska that her great am
bition was to go upon the stage. Mr.
Northam was bitterly opposed to his
daughter joining the dramatic profes
sion, but she was persistent, and Mme.
Modjeska at last consented to give her
an opportunity to test her ability. She
traveled with Mme. Modjeska and her
husband, Count Bozenta, stopped at
the same hotels and was virtually a
member of their family.
While the company was playing at
the Fifth Avenue Theater here last win
ter she was seen In several small parts,
all of which she ulayed with taste and
discretion. Mme. Modjeska expressed
the friendliest Interest in her young
protege and introduced her to many
of her personal friends both in this and
other cities which the company visited.
The unexpected news, therefore, of
her marriege has cai -:ed no little inter
est Mr. Reilly is quite well known in
theatrical circles. His attentions to
Misa Northam, it is said, were fre
quently observed by other members of
the company although they were never
obtrusive, and very few had any idea
that matters had progressed so far as
an engagement until after the wedding
had taken place. -â  . ;,
L*)S ANGELES, June 2.â Colonel
Rcbert J. Northam, father of Miss
Maud Northam, is a wealthy ranch
owner in urang" County. His proper
ty lies to the south of Santa Ana, and it
is a veritable principality of itself. He
is possessed of large wealth, which
came to him from an uncle for whom
he acted as .fiduciary agent for a long
time. Miss Maud Northam was edu
cated abroad. When she became a
member of Modjeska's company it was
the first intimation her friends here
had of her determination to go on the
stage Colonel Northam was at first
very averse to his daughter, who is
very beautiful, attempting a profes
sional career, but finally consented.
Colonel Northam was not in town to
day, but a very close friend of Colonel
and Mrs. Northam, In speaking of the
marriage this evening, said: "Both
mother and father were surprised when
Informed of the marriage of their
daughter, but It has not caused am- es
trangement. Colonel Northam has
learned that his son-in-law is a worthy
man.
vies and Sir Wilfrid Laurler, signed
at the State Department a protocol for
the appointment of a commission, to
consider ail pending questions between
the United States and Canada and this
protocol was sent to London for the
approval of the Salisbury government.
Secretary Day has cabled to Embassa-.
dor Hay his satisfaction at this prospec- â¢
tiye settlement of the various questions
pending between the two governments,
and it is expected that Lord Salisbury
will promptly give his approval to the
protocol. From the present indications
it is' expected that the commissioners
who will be named by the President to
represent the United States will be Mr.
Kasson and Mr. Foster, the former be
cause of his wide experience as a. di
plomat and his familiarity with tariff
matters, and the latter because he is
a seal expert.
Although there are various questions
between the United States and Austria,
including the prohibition of American
plants and fruits, as stated in the Her
ald this morning, and high tariffs im
posed by each Government on exports
of the other, the Vienna Government
has not indicated in any way its de
sire to enter into reciprocity negotia
tions, and in view of its well known
friendship for Spain, it is not consid
ered at all likely that it will initiate
such negotiations, at least until the
conclusion of the war..
Russia has taken the subject up, and
Germany, appreciating that it is the
only, satisfactory way of adjusting com
mercial relations with the United
States, has buckled down to the hard
work of wringing from Mr. Kasson all
she can get without making any con
cessions in return.

Spain FaNsto Check Our

NOT DIRECT TO UNCLE SAM

BORS FOR PRIVATE PARTIES.
Neither British Columbia Nor Nova
Scotia Has Violated the
Neutrality Laws of
Nations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 2.
The Spanish Government has made a
protest to the British authorities
against the shipping of Canadian coal
from British North America to San
Francisco for- the relief of the ships of
Admiral Dewey's fleet at Manila, and
also against the shipping of coal from
Novia Scotia to Atlantic ports for use
by the United States of warships ope
rating in the West Indies.
In view of the ruling by the British
Government that coal was contraband
of war this protest by Spain might
have caused considerable embarrass
ment, as the Canadian coal is consid
ered by the naval authorities to be
a superior article for the use of our
ships. It is only a short distance from
the British North American coal fields
to San Francisco and the Nova Scotia
coal fields are easily accessible to At
lantic ports.
It is understood, however, that
Spain's protest has not proved of any
avail. The subject was referred to
the Canadian authorities, who, on In
vestigation, learned that the coal ship
ments, both from the British North
America and from Nova Scotia, were
In the ordinary course of commercial
transactions. They were made by priv
ate parties in Canada to private par
ties in the United States. Whether
the coal subsequently passed into the
hands of the United States for use by
the American navy was held to be out
side of the province of the British and
Canadian authorities. It is probable
that any direct sales to the Navy De
partment would have been stopped, as
these would have been manifestly a
breach of the neutral attitude main
tained by the British Government and
its colonial possessions, including Can
ada. ______________

Schooner Helen Torn From Her
Anchorage and Washed on the
Beach â The Story Told by
Captain Durie.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, June 2.â While the Jane
Gray was sinking to the bottom of the
Pacific Ocean with thirty-six persons
on board, Sunday, May 22, a hurricane
was blowing over the Alaska peninsu
la and tumbling up the water at
Unalaska and Dutch Harbor. The lit
tle schooner Helen, with a party of
Easterners aboard for Kotzebue Sound,
was blown out of Dutch Harbor and
wound up a mad race with the waves
by going ashore. The ship Harry Morse
would certainly have gone ashore and
become a total wreck had it not been
for the quick service rendered by the
United States revenue-cutter Bear.
The American ship Wachusett dragged
her anchors for over half a mile, but
they caught just in time to keep her
off the beach. The bark Carlton also
dragged her anchors.
The Brixam got up steam and took
the river steamer Governor Pingree
and a big barge into safe anchorage in
Dutch Harbor. Captain Durie of the
Brixam, which arrived here this after
noon, related to a Call correspondent
the following story of the hurricane:
"For several days prior to Sunday,
May 22, the weather had been bad.
Early that morning the gale began to
blcfW a terrible hurricane. I have been
through several East Indian hurri
canes, but I never saw one that equale-1
the Unalaska storm. The Harry' Morse
and the ship Wachusett began to drag
their anchors and were moving toward
shore. Suddenly one of the Morses
anchor chains snapped under the great
strain, and Captain Fullerton, thinking
that his vessel was doomed, signaled
for assistance. Captain Tuttle went to
his assistance with the revenue-cutter
Bear.
"The Bear ran as near the Morse as
possible and dropped overboard a heavy
anchor. A seven-inch hawser was
passed to th^ bark after great difficulty
and made fast. The two anchors then
held. The Wachusett carried her an
chors half a mile and they caught just
In time to keep the big ship off the
rocks.
"The schooner Helen, with twenty
prospectors aboard, was not so fortun
ate. She had a small anchor out, but
as the storm increased in force she
broke and went scudding down the
bay. Most of her passengers were
Aboard, and thought they were surely
doomed. The Helen went before the
gale for aboilt two miles Lefore finally
v running ashore. She struck on Ililliuk
Point. She went high and dry on top :
of a big wave. The men aboard jumped. â¢/
off into shallow water and made for the â¢ '.
beach. ..-'-â  'â â ' ' â  â â 'â  'â¢:".â¢ ' :â  '-'.
"Just how badly the Helen had heeii '

SENT FORTH TO DEATH-
THE wreck of the Jane Gray was no ordinary
disaster of the sea. It was not an instance in
which a valiant ship battling against adverse
winds and rolling waves succumbed at last to the ele
ments. On the contrary, it was an example of the
wicked and criminal negligence and greed which
sends out upon the deep a craft not fit to leave its
moorings in the mud flats. When the Jane Gray
sailed the fact was known that only by the kindness
of Providence could she keep afloat. Yet there was
no hesitancy in accepting all the passengers who
would pay fare.
Surely in taking passengers who ran a risk so
dreadful it would have been the most natural pre
caution to furnish for them life rafts or life preservers.
But this was not done. When the rotten timbers
yielded to a pressure that sound ones would have
withstood there was left to nearly two score of those
aboard no chance of escape, and they perished mis
erably â human beings in a trap.
There seems to be no tendency to dispute the alle
gation that the vessel, bad as it was In itself, was im
properly loaded. An extra deckhouse tended to
make it unwieldy, and this was so flimsily constructed
that, regardless of stress of weather, it constituted a
grave menace.
The Jane Gray but emphasizes the lesson taught
by the wreck of the Almy. There should be laws de
vised for as rigid inspection of sailing vessels as of
steam, and for violation of these laws there should
be a penalty so severe that even the lust for gold
would not tempt speculators into luring their fellow
men to death. As it is the responsible parties may
be censured, a process for which they will care
naught. The rapacity which actuates such a horrible
deed as the sending to sea of an unseaworthy ship is
not sensitive. It is probably looking about even now
for another old tub by means of which to win passage
money and slay the deluded mortals who pay this.
San Francisco is getting old enough and big enough
to abolish the folly of shutting off street lights on the
nights when the benefit of a full moon is supposed to
be had. An inconsiderate fog has been known to
snuff out the moon, leaving the city in absolute
blackness. There is a theory that the city saves
money, but there is no particular reason for having
any faith in this. The. gas company's meters never
hesitate to register the consumption of gas in. a pri
vate house even though not a jet be lighted, and
they would not be likely to be more liberal with the
city..
Why the New York Journal should claim to have
possession of a flag captured by Dewey at Manila
passes comprehension. It is a rule of that sheet to make
its lies seem plausible. It could not have received
the flag unless by cable, a method of transit offering
few advantages in the shipment of textile fabrics.
Neither could it ever get such a flag unless Dewey
were to directly violate a law governing the subject,
and which declares specifically that a captured flag
becomes the property of the Government.
When Captain Bernadou shall recover control of
his wounded leg he can make no better use of it than
to kick the yellow editor who declares that the fatali
ties on the Winslow were due to a shot fired by that
vessel. The statement was a mean lie and a palpable
slander. â¢
With becoming modesty, the type not being more
than half an inch high, the funny New York Journal
takes to itself all the credit for having an Expedition
sent to re-enforce Dewey. The matter does not call
for comment so much as for a commission in lunacy.
The fact that shots from the Spanish forts were
fired with tolerable accuracy demonstrates that the
Spanish have risen to the occasion and hired a few
gunners who can sight a cannon even if not stimu

THE DEMOCRATIC CINCH-
THE Democratic State Committee has met and
solemnly recorded its opinion that the party "in
San Francisco cannot be trusted to manage its
own affairs. It is put under the suzerainty of the
State Committee, which comes in from the country
to take charge of city politics. Petaluma and Mil
pitas, Grub Gulch and Yankee Jim's precincts put
their rural fingers in the San Francisco pie and will
do the little Johnny Homer act to perfection.
The triumvirate of the State Committee has said
it, and it is. One member of this political trinity is
from San Francisco and the other two hail from
Stockton and Visalia respectively. They have
adopted the party pandects, consisting of eighteen
rules, which settle the party hash for San Francisco.
Rule I recites that the Democratic city committee
shall have power to pass on all questions of elections,
primaries and registrations, subject to limitations
and restrictions. These are: Vacancies in the county
committee can be filled only on confirmation by the
State Committee; the whole city committee which
may succeed the present committee must be con
firmed by the State Committee before it can exer
cise any authority; the present city committee is ap
pointed outright by the State Committee. This city
committee appointed by the State Committee may
select and appoint city delegates to the State conven
tion. An appeal from any action by the committee
lies to the State Committee.
It will be seen that under this most remarkable
regulation the State Committee, by electing the pres
ent city committee and authorizing it to appoint dele
gates to the State and other conventions, has usurped
the power to not only install the party machinery
in San Francisco, but to appoint delegates from here
to the party conventions. The rules also provide
that this county committee "shall provide for the
nomination of city, county and district officials," un
der which grant of power it may itself nominate
such candidates.
In the history of party management there is no
other case in which the rank and file were ever so
completely deprived of a voice in their local affairs.
It is no wonder that one member of the State Com
mittee in the meeting in which this job was put
through asked by what rule, written or unwritten,
the Democratic State Committee constituted itself
the guardian of the Democracy of one section of the
State. He asked if the Democracy of San Fran
cisco had asked to have a guardian appointed, and
declared that it was all wrong to invade the rights of
any section of the Democracy and the attempt should
not be tolerated, for he did not understand that the
State Committee was created to perpetuate any re
gime or clique in control of the party, and he wanted
to know, if this sort of thing were forced upon the
Democrats of San Francisco, what city would next
be invadedi This protesting rurale ought to have
made a motion to appoint a receiver for the Democ
racy of San Francisco instead of a guardian.
Under these rules the party here can never resume
control of its own affairs. They will remain per
petually in the hands of the State Committee, which
can dictate the local delegation to all State conven
tions and even the nomination of all local candi
dates. The members of the party are left only one
right, that of voting for candidates kindly nominated
by the State Committee. This action is symptomatic.
It means thatjthe methods adopted in the Democratic
National Convention of 1896 are to influence the
party organization everywhere. The Bryan wiir^
controlled a majority of that national convention and
could make a platform. But it lacked the two-thirds
required by the party rule in force since 1836 to nomi
nate a candidate. This difficulty was overcome by
expelling bodily the Nebraska delegation and enough
of the delegates from Michigan and other States to
control them under the unit rule. These expelled
members were elected and credentialed as regularly
as the delegation from California, which voted to ex
pel them. The national convention then usurped the
functions of the State conventions by electing dele
gates to the vacancies it had violently created. This
action by a party that has so loudly proclaimed State
rights and home rule secured the needed two-third 3
majority to nominate Mr. Bryan.
The ousting of the San Francisco Democrats from
the slightest voice in their own affairs is the filtering
of the national convention policy down to local
.iff airs.
It has always been held, and by none more per
sistently than the Democracy, that healthy politics
requires that the people have free rein in party man
agement. But now that party does not scruple to put
defiantly on record its distrust of the people and its
decision that they cannot be trusted even to appoint
a local party committee! If this action is indorsed at
the polls the Democrats of this city, who hold the
balance of party power in the State, will have con
demned themselves to a sort of penal servitude to the
bosses of the State Committee.
The latter body, by applying the same theory of
party management throughout the State, can per
petuate itself in power, and the party in every pre
cinct in California will have parted with its influence
and control in its own affairs.
A FOOLISH POLICY.
BY reason of the hostile attitude assumed by the
Parisian press toward the United States in the
war with Spain there has grown up in this
country a responsive feeling of hostility which, among
other forms of expression, has developed an opposi
tion toward the Paris exposition of 1900. It is said
an effort is being made to induce Congress to pro
vide no appropriation for an exhibit from this country
at the exposition, and 'that further efforts â¢will be made
to induce the various States and even individuals to
ignore that great undertaking of French enterprise.
It would be difficult to find on a large scale a better
illustration than this of that foolish policy known as
cutting off the nose to spite the face. An exhibition
of. American products at Paris in 1900 would not be
for the benefit of France, but for that of the United
States. We have not proposed an appropriation of
money for such an exhibit out of any sentimental re
gard for the French, but out of a strictly business re
gard for ourselves. If we make the exhibit we will
profit by it. If we do not make it we will lose that
opportunity to make known to the world the variety
and quality of the articles we have for sale. Other
people will get the markets and we will get nothing.
French hostility has taken a form that has been un
doubtedly irritating. We had a right to expect better
things of a race that has at all times posed as a cham
pion of liberty and humanity. The gibes of Parisian
wits and the denunciations of boulevard critics have
not been pleasant to read, and we have naturally felt
inclined to retaliate. There are ways by which such
retaliations can be made effective, but the proposed
scheme for ignoring the exposition is not one of them*
The universal exposition of industries with which
the century is to close is something more than a
French enterprise. It appeals to the imagination of
men in all lands and has aroused the energies of the
industrious of every nation, Paris is in a large sense
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALX., FRIDAY, JUNE 3, IS9S.
a world capital. It is the center to which men and
women resort from the four quarters of the globe for
pleasure and for fashion. When the exposition opens
it will be thronged by artisans, merchants and busi
ness men of every class and of every clime. The
people whose industry is not represented there will
not be conspicuous by its absence. In the vast mul
titude of exhibits of all kinds it will not be noticed
that anything is lacking, and those not there will
simply have lost the opportunity for display.
It is to be hoped the project to induce Congress to
refuse an appropriation for the American exhibit will
be dropped. We may owe France a snub in return for
her insults, but the snub must not be given in a way
that will hurt ourselves more than it will hurt France.
It would be a better revenge to send to her exposition
such an exhibit of fruits, wines and other articles of
luxury as would take her trade away from her for
our enrichment.
ANNEXATION AND MAJORITY RULE.
SENATOR LODGE, during his effort to block
the war revenue bill by an amendment to annex
Hawaii, said to the Senate: "It is a generally
recognized principle in this country that the majority
ought to rule, and any violation of that principle is a
travesty on justice."
Neither the junior Senator from Massachusetts nor
any one else will have the hardihood to deny that
more than two-thirds of the people of Hawaii, exclud
ing the coolies, oppose annexation. None will deny
that for this opposition more than two-thirds of the
Hawaiian people are disfranchised and deprived of a
voice in their government. None will deny that an
nexation is desired only by an insignificant minority
of the people of Hawaii. Therefore the principle of
majority rule is violated by annexation and that pol
icy is a travesty on justice. It is well in times of
storm and stress to take our bearings, accept fixed
principles as our compass and steer where they point
out the course.
It is because we have from the beginning insisted
upon majority rule that we have been accepted as a
beacon by believers in the rights of man.
Can it be possible that we are to declare ourselves
a false light, to lure upon the shoals instead of guid
ing to safe anchorage in quiet waters ?
Can we contend that we believe in majority rule
for ourselves and adopt its opposite for others? Can
it be possible that our power is to be used in helping
small minorities in other countries to throttle the
majority, destroy autonomy, transfer sovereignty,
shift allegiance and seize and convert public property?
Can we stand on this principle of majority rule and
consent of the governed at home and by our im
perial power violate it everywhere abroad? Are we
to make it our mission to cow and browbeat ma
jorities into silence while minorities steal govern
ments and transfer countries to our flag?
If so our methods will go into history as infamous
beyond expression.
How can any American tolerate the proposition to
take Hawaii from Dole's minority oligarchy and not
as the offer of a majority of the people ?
How can any American retain his self-respect while
pretending to follow in Hawaii the Texas precedent
while refusing to Hawaiians the privilege given to
Texans of a vote by all of the people upon the trans
fer of their allegiance?
Senator Lodge's plea for majority rule in the Sen
ate is the most decisive condemnation of the purpose
for which that Senatorial majority is to be used.
There is but one justifiable rule between men and
among nations, and that is the rule of right and of
justice. We are before the world as the champion of
that rule against Spain. Can we look the world in
the face and defiantly violate it ourselves?
EUROPE^ SUBSIDES.
rOR a time at least Europe has subside*!. The
suggestions of a possible intervention to prevent
the dismemberment of the colonial empire of
Spain, of which we heard so much when the war broke
out, are now of infrequent occurrence, and when put
forth at all are made in a minor tone. No one gives
further heed to them. The contest is but little more
than fairly begun, and yet it has already disposed of
one important issue. It has made clear that the ac
tions of the United States either in peace or in war
are not to be subject to European interference.
The speedy elimination of this factor from our con
flict with Spain has been due undoubtedly in a large
measure to the position taken in regard to it by Great
Britain and to the bold utterances of Salisbury and
Chamberlain. Nevertheless it would probably have
been disposed of just as effectually had those states
men been silent. The course taken by the Govern
ment at Washington has shown in a most unmistak
able way that we will deal with Spain as our interests
require and will not turn aside in any respect fof fear
or favor of any other nation or concert of nations.
The preparations made for following up the victory
of Admiral Dewey by sending to Manila an army
sufficiently strong to occupy, conquer and hold the
islands are an effective notice to Europe that interfer
ence will not be permitted. We are prepared to ac
cept all the responsibilities that follow the events of
the war. If by the overthrow of a Spanish force we
leave the subjects or the commercial interests of any
nation exposed to raids and spoliation we are able
to re-establish law and protect them. The star
spangled banner will guarantee the property and the
lives of all Russian, German, French, British or other
persons in the Philippines. No foreign Government
shall have any excuse for intervening in any way
whatever.
The powers of Europe have evidently recognized
the true nature of the situation and are submissive to
it. We hear now and then of some newspaper tirade
against the United States, and occasionally the angry
utterance of some sea captain of a foreign ship in the
West Indies denouncing us for our course there, but
we hear no more of those efforts on the part of the
powers to arrange for a concert of action, which were
so common at the beginning of the war. The active
interference statesmen have subsided. The European
jingo has collapsed.
There seems to have been a successful landing of
troops and supples in Cuba. If the yellow press had
not been thrown off the scent this could never have
happened. It would have told the Spaniards just
where and when to meet the expedition.
Apparently there are to be two Generals Otis sent
to the Philippines,. and if the major happen to get his
identity mixed with that of the brigadier he will
have hard work holding on to his popularity.
It is too bad that the Columbia should by a poke
in the ribs from a neutral craft have been cheated of
the chance to win glory just at a time when there is
so much glory available.
An incoming navigator of the South Atlantic re
ports the discovery of a large body of hot water down
that way. Perhaps this is some of the water Spain's
fleet is in, -^ (

Initials "B. Y." had been f-rnbroidered In
red He was mightily proud of the grift,
and when his priceless Stradlvarius was
not in use it was enveloped In the silken
covering.
That was before present hostilities ex
isted between the United Btates and
Spain. But when the relations between
the two Governments became strained,
Ysaye, who has acquired a great love for
our country, thought that it would be
traitorous to use the hated colors of Spain
for his violin cover, but being a consci
entious fellow and having a high regard
for the donor he did not particularly care
to discard the gift.
Finally when he reached this city, with
Gerardy to play a local engagement, he
was taking a stroll one afternoon and
happened to see a magnificent silk flag
in a show window and the thought imme
diately dawned upon him to have it con
verted into a cover for his beloved in
strument, and the transformation was
forthwith accomplished. That night he
appeared at the theater and Just before
going on the stage the patriotic artist
opened his violin case and disclosed to
view "Old Glory," which he waved in
satisfied glee, and three suppressed
cheers behind the scenes was the result,
in which the maestro heartily joined.
The next night Gerardy, not to be out
done by his associate, took off the outer
cover of his violoncello, and there sur
rounding his instrument waa another
silken American flag, and the cheers that
followed were not quite as suppressed as
those in the flret instance. The artists de
clare that Blnce the stars and stripes
have been utilized to cover their instru
ments the resultant music appears to
have Increased in fervor and strength

AMERICAN SHIPBUILDERS.
Admiral Dewey'a great victory will
operate very favorably for this country.
The ships he had were all built at hornÂ«.
They, are not the beat wax vessels In the
American navy, but the fact that the
combined fire cf the Spanish fleet and
forts was unable to destroy them speaks
volumes for our shipbuilders. When it
is remembered that the building of ships
of war is a new business in this country
tne fact that a respectable navy has
been constructed in less than fifteen
years, and that foreign nations are giv
ing us large contracts for ships and
armor, is something for our people to be
proud of. The United States is now sell
ing England iron and steel products and
a high authority in that country has said
that in these this country is destined to
lead the world. Who knows but that not

Colonel Frost is an officer in the regu
lar establishment, being a first lieutenant
in the Twenty-fifth United States Infan
try. For several years he has been on
detached service in South Dakota as in
structor of military science and tactics
at Agricultural College and afterward
military secretary to Governor Lee. When
his regiment went to the front Colonel
Frost Join* o ' s It at Chickamauga under or
ders, but on the petition of Governor Lee
and the leading citizens of the Str.te, as
well as the entire National Guard, he
was granted indefinite leave in order to
accept the colonelcy of the volunteers.
A telegram was sent on ahead notifying
the commanding general of the condition
of affairs and requesting that tents and
other articles be ready when the regiment
arrived. ' It was after 6 o'clock when the
last battalion reached camp, and no pro
vision had been maue for It. The regi
ment had been most hospitably received
at the ferry by the Red Cross Society and
the men given a good hot dinner, the first
wurm meal they had had since leaving
home. The First Battalion arrived at
12:45 p. m. and started for camp as soon
as the men had finished dinner. The Se<;
onii Battalion came in an hour after the
First moved, and the Third landed at the
ferry at 3 o'clock. What camp oui.ts they
brought were on the last section and did
not get to camp until long after 7 o'clock.
As soon as each battalion arrived it was
marched into. the temporary dining-room
in the depot, and the hungry soldiers were
not slow in getting into action. They
volced their appreciation with repeated
cheers for the Red Cross Society, and af
ter making good use of the postal cards
distributed among them by the ladles on
which to send word of their safe arrival
to dear ones at home,, they started out
to camp.
SKIRMISHED FOR RATIONS.
How Mrs. Harrington Obtained
Supper for the South Da
kota Volunteers.
When the 1000 volunteers from South
Dakota arrived In this city yesterday af
ternoon they were surprised and de
lighted at the generous reception given
them by the energetic workers of the Red
Cross. They were sent on their way to
camp with lighter hearts after their fa
tiguing Journey of many hundred miles,
but when they arrived at their encamp
ment and found a barren reception their
feelings can be Imagined.
After setting up tents and working dili
gently their sharp appetites began to as
sert itself and the men began to look for
supper. Imagine their HUFprise when
they found that the Government had for
gotten them in the bustle of war, and
they might have gone to bed supperless
but for the kindly efforts of the Red
Cross ladles.
As soon as Mrs. Harrington heard of
their condition she gathered around her
an efficient corps of ladies and began
skirmishing for food. Major Hooper of
the Occidental sent out a wagon load, as
did other down-town restaurants and
hostelrles. The nurses at the Children's
Hospital prepared coffee, and within an
hour their hunger was appeased. As they
might not receive breakfast owing to the

The picture of the dismantled Philadelphia was taken at the time the thr**
great 12-inch hawsers manufactured by the Tubbs Cordage Company for use in
towing the Monterey to the Philippines were delivered at the yard on Saturday,
The hawsers were taken up the bay on the tug Reliance, and "were lifted from the

and common school education are de
sired. Those who have had experience as
cooks or nurses, and persons possessing
some knowledge of drugs and the driv
ing and care of horses, and the handling

When the First Montana went into \
camp there was- a nice fence all around
the camp, but it has gradually melted
away until little more than the posts re
main. The boys say fence boards make
much better firewood than the wood sup- :
plied by the Government; besides it splits
much easier.
The Call is In receipt of a letter from '
a member of the First Montana Regi
ment, who fails to sign his name, in !
which the writer complains that the men j
] art not granted liberty enough. He al
i leges that the few passes issued each day
I are given to pets of the officers, while
j those less favored are compelled to re
main close In camp or take chances on
running the guard line. If the writer
will lay his grievance before Colonel
i Wallace. The Call is confident that If
there is any merit in it it will be recti
ned promptly, for there is no more just
or humane officer in camp than Colonel
Wallace and he fully appreciates the
] value of having his men contented with
j their lot.

CREDITORS COME FIRST.
The Hale Estate Must Not Be Crip
pled by Beneficiaries.
The Justices of the Supreme Court yes
terday gave the lower court of this city
a setback In the case of the estate of
! Joseph p. Hale, deceased. By his will he
left to his sisters, Mary Hale and
Margaret Ryan, and hisbrother John a be
quefet in the form of a life annunity of $50
a month each. The will was probated in
May, 1593. In June, 1896, the sisters and
brother filed petitions in the lower court,
setting, up that their annuniti.es had not
lii-en paid and that the estate was in a
condition to pay the same. Hale's widow,
who is also the administratrix, the daugh
ter and several creditors made opposition
to the granting of the petitions, stating
that the estate was largely In debt and
that the- distribution asked for would be
a detriment, to the estate and an injury
to the creditors. However, the lower
court made an order granting the petition
and requiring the administratrix to pay
Mary Hale $2492 36 and John Hale a like
sum, and to Mrs. Ryan 's622 20. which had
accrued since the will had been probated;
also ordering her to keep up monthly pay
ments to the beneficiaries named.
From this an appeal w;ts taken. The
Supreme Justices, upon loqking into the
facts, found that the estate Is really
heavily incumbered. Its value is $4fi2.000,
with an admitted Indebtedness of over
. $250,000, and an undetermined demand,
â I now in litigation, for $100,000, and other
, claims, which will likely feach over $4iÂ»).
.000. The Supreme Court holds that the
demands of the creditors should come
. first, and if the order of th* lower court
was carried out the administratrix would
. be greatly embarrassed, in her adminis
tration, and an enforced sale of some of
the property at a great sacrifice neces
sary. For these reasons the order was
reversed. A part of the Hale estate con

WALKA WINS HIS
SUNDAY CLOTHES.
THE POLICE SEE NO OBJECT IN
HOLDING THEM LONGER.
Chief Lees Thunders a Rebuke to His
Astute Sleuths Who Weaken
and Surrender the
Loot.
:â  Gustav "Walka rejoices in the possession
of his $45 suit. He came around yester
day to thank this paper for it, but really
the paper had done nothing but tell the
truth, a process said to shame the devil,
and evidently equally potent In shaming
the police.
Walka's suit was stolen, the police
found it in a pawnshop, and taking it
from the pawn-broker held it until such
time as the. owner nhould be able to pro
duce $7 50, the sum the diligent Shylock
had advanced the thieves. As explained
yesterday morning, the police had no
right to do this. They must have known
that t*iey lacked the right, for if they
didn't know it how they manage to get
in out of the rain must remain a problem.
Yesterday Walka was summoned to the
headquarters of Chief Lees, or so, with
bated breath, the tale is told, and asked
if he was responsible for the article
which appeared in The Call. Indeed, with
a tragic air and a tremulous finger, the
Chief was pointing to the article. Walka
tried to explain that he was not, but the
burr of Sweden still sticks to his tongue,
and he made alow headway. At last his
information percolated the intelligence of
the Chief, and the two sleuths were sum
moned.
The Chief frowned mightily. "Did you
or did you not find this stolen suit in a
pawnshop?" thundered be in tones
whereat the plastering quivered.
"We did." responded the pair, glancing
timidly to Pee if the Chief held an ax.
"Then why in don't you give the
man his clothes and let him go? r ' contin
ued the indignant head of the depart
ment. "Do you think we want a

"It's all a mistake. Chief," the sleuths
said, bowing low. "The clothes wouldn't
fit either of us and the man couldn't dig
up $7 50."
So Walka won his suit.

but it covers the ground.

DAYLIGHT THIEVES
PLY THEIR TRADE.
STOLE A LARGE QUANTITY OP
LIQUOR AND ESCAPED.
The Crime Was Committed Within a
Hundred Yards of Two Police
Stations.

Daylight thieves, who ride around and
; ply their nefarious trade and rely on the
1 fleet steed they drive as a means of es
cape, are now operating in the heart of
â¢ the city, distracting the police and non
' pluslng the detectives. Their last lawless
'â  act was committed yesterday morning at
9:30 o'clock at the corner of Larkin and
' McAllister streets, which is within a hun
dred yards of the Central and Southern
police stations.
i Gus Davis, who drives a delivery wagon
i for Blumenthal & Co., liquor dealers, left
â  his wagon standing on the corner near
the City Hall, and entered Smoot's saloon
to take an order. Two well-dressed men
immediately stepped into a buggy stand
ing near the curb and drove near Davis'
delivery wagon, where one of the men
alighted. With cool deliberation, he went
over to the delivery wagon and after ex
amining the tags on the various demi
johns he selected several containing i
whisky and lifted one at a time from the ;
wagon Into his buggy. The completion of
the theft took a minute or two, and in the i
I meantime an aged shoemaker had hurried
to Smuut's saloon and Informed Davis
that his goods were being stolen. Davis '
came hounding out of the saloon and i
! Btarted toward the thieves, but with a se
rene smile they sailed away up the street.
Davis and several citizens, there being no
! policeman in sight, started in pursuit, but j
' after a few blocks' run all gave up the ,
, chase, and the thieves made good their '
. escape. Tho case was reported at police
I headquarters, but as yet the thieves have
â¢ not been apprehended.

WALLER IS
ACQUITTED
SchooJ Director Found
Not Guilty.
VERDICT WAS APPROVED.
THE PROSECUTION HAD A VERY
WEAK CASE.
Damaging Testimony Given by Eli T.
Shepard Refuted by Several
Reliable Wit
nesses.
School Director Samuel Waller has been
declared innocent of the charge of solicit
ing a bribe from Eli T. Shepard. After
all the evidence was in and counsel had
argued the points of the case the jury
entered a verdict of not guilty. The fol
lowing were the jurors: â¢ James Mc-
Gushen, F. W. Kampe, J. A. Kenney, J.
Bremer, H. Harms. Otto Wielweber, R.
V. Crosky, W. Hinckley, A. S. Lownde*,
W. E. Lovejoy, Frank Dumont and Ed
ward Oliver. In a few minutes it was an
nounced by the foreman that a decia.on
had been reached.
When the case was called yesterday
morning and the jury had been completed
the first witness to be called was Eli T.
Shepard, the complainant. He stated
that on May 11, 1897, he called at Waller's
drugstore to interview the School Direc
tor regarding a position he wished to ob
tain for his daughter in the School De
partment.
"He then told me that he would give
her the position if I paid him $500," said
the witness.
On cross-examination Mr. Shepard said
he was well acquainted with Julian Wal
ler, the brother of the defendant, and had
invited him to his ranch and had enter
tained him.
"Did you not try to Induce Samuel Wal
ler to go into business with you?" was
asked. â¢
The witness said he did not know, but
had some Idea of having offered to put
up $20,000 for the purchase of Joy's drug
store at Market and Stockton streets, and
later tendered the same amount for the
Wakelee pharmacy at Sutter and Polk
streets.
"Did you not tender Julian Waller $150
a month and offer him an interest in the
Wakelee business after live years' serv
ice?" queried Mr. Dunne.
"No, sir; I did not."
"Did you not. in speaking to Julian
Waller, say, "Well, you know me; 1 will
fix it all right with you?' "
"No, sir; 1 did not."
"Did you not before the Grand Jury
swear that $400 was demanded of you, and
not $500?"
"No, sir; I did not."
Julian Waller, a brother of the defend
ant, was the next witness called, and he
flatly contradicted Shepard. "It was true
that Shepard entered the drugstore on
the date mentioned." said ihe witness,
"but it is false that Samuel Waller made
any offer. When Shepard entered tho
store on that day and addressed Samuel
Waller his reply was, 'Oh, I've no time to
talk school business to-day; come some
other day.' " Shepard left, apparently an
gry at the abrupt dismissal. Julian Waller's
testimony was corroborated by Frank
Worthington, and James A. Snook, secre
tary of the Grand Jury, was called. He
produced the engrossed minutes of the
meeting at which Waller was indicted.
and the fact that Shepard had testified at
that meeting that Waller wanted $400. not
$500, was proved. Many other witnesses
to testify to Waller's previous good char
acter were called, and then the defendant
took the stand. He denied the charge
against him, his testimony being sub
stantially the same as that given by his
brother and Frank Worthington.
When Waller had concluded his testi
mony the case was argued and th^n sub
mitted to the jury, which returned in a
few minutes and entered Its verdict.
When the foreman announced that the jury
had found the defendant not guilty there
was a demonstration of approval, but
the rapping of the oaillff's gavel soon
quieted the applause of the crowd, Wal
ler, surrounded by his friends, all com
menting on the weak case put up by the
prosecution, then left the courtroom.

House as his bride Goldberg, Bowen &
Co. published a ditty in an advertising
circular In which the name of Ngong
Fong appeared. The ditty was published
for the purpose of advertising a brand of
tea, but it commented in a way not ex
actly to the taste of Ngong on the woo
ing and wedding of a Ngong Fong he
took to be himself. In consequence he
brought a suit against the firm respon
sible for the publication and asked that
$10,000 damages be awarded him.
The poem was read to the jury when
the case was called yesterday morning,
and Ngong, who was present in court
with his wife, was put on the stand. For
one who had long ago renounced the cus
toms of his native country he said the
coupling of his name with joss sticks,
bird-nest soup and tomtoms was very hu
miliating and had hurt him greatly. E.
J. Arnold, who was responsible for the
advertisement, next took the stand, and
stated that it was purely accidental that
the poem happened to fit Ngong and his
marriage. Ho had no idea of the exist
ence of the plaintiff and intended to re
flect upon no one. "Witnesses to corro
borate Arnold were called, and the case
then went to the jury, with the result
that Xgong was awarded $1/ 28 . as a
compensation for the libel.

HIGHTON AWARDED
HIS COUNSEL FEES.
ATTORNEY GIVEN JUDGMENT
AGAINST E. J. BALDWIN.
Sarcastic Eeference Made by Counsel
Bepresenting the Plaintiff to the
Ashley Scandal.
A jury in Judge Hunt's court deter
mined late Wednesday evening that the
services rendered by Henry E. Highton
on behalf of p:. J. Baldwin, the well
known millionaire, during his trying or
deal in court aÂ« defendant in an action
instigated against him by JLillian Ashley,
and several minor matters, were reason
ably worth $8755 GO. liighton in his -ac
tion against Baldwin claimed $12,500 as a
fee for his services. Baldwin as a counter
claim alleged that Highton owed him a
large sum for board and lodging, and
stated in his answer that Highton's labor
in his behalf was not worth more than
$3750.
The trial occupied several days and
drew a crowd of interested onlookers.
The argument in the case was exceed
ingly caustic, especially that of Attorney
Walter Linforth, who represented High
ton in the action. As he argued he Jield
in his hand a copy of the decision in the
case of Lillian Ashley against the aged
millionaire, and referred sarcastically to
those portions that reflected on Baldwin's
relations with the young woman. Baldwin
listened stocially to the words of the at
torney, but was evidently relieved when
the jury retired to deliberate on its ver-r
diet. When it returned, however, and en
tered the judgment against him he mani
fested surprise, as did his counsel, but
no comment was made. In all probability
a motion for a new trial will be made,
and in the event that it is denied an ap
peal will be taken to the Supreme Conrt.

TJNWARBANTED ASSEbSMENT.
Supreme Justices Have No Sympathy
for Street Contract Jobbery.
Contractor John Kelso has met with an
other reverse, this time at the hands of
the Justices of the Supreme Court. Kelso
brought action against P. J. Cole and
others upon a street assessment. In 1894
he received from Contractor J. W. Smith
a contract to do certain work on Sunny
side avenue, between Circular avenue and
Hamburg street, in this city.' The con
tract was extended from time to time un
til It finally expired in December, 1895.
Since then no part of the work has been
done between Tennessee and Forester
streets, being one block of Sunnyside ave
nue, included in the contract. The resi
due of the work was certified by the Su
perintendent of Streets to have been com
pleted. : On January, 1896, the Board of
Supervisors .ordered a â¢ proportional as
sessment to be made under section 12 1 , i
of the amended general street laws. The
question under . consideration was, had
the Supervisors jurisdiction to order a
proportional assessment when a portion
of the work had been abandoned by the
contractor and the time for the comple
tion of the whole contract had expired.
Kelso lost his case in the lower court,
and again yesterday in the Supreme Court,
which says: "We are of the opinion that
the section Is provided as Â« boon .trÂ» the
contractor who In good faith Is prosecut
ing his work within the lines ot ins agree
ment, and not as a reward to a default
ing contractor who 'â  has forfeited his
right to any relief in the premises. It fol
lows from these views that the assess
ment was void and constituted no lien
upon the lot of: the defendants. . . .
For the reasons given In the foregoing
opinion the judgment appealed from Is
affirmed."

A young lady in JN T ew York Crty relates the curious case of heVsfstw
who suffered from a sort of nervous dyspepsiaâ that was what the doc-
tor called it. She was despondent low-spirited, inclined to imagine all
sorts of things. One thing especially seenied to be in her mind ; that
was the idea that abscesses were forming in different parts, of her body.
The sister who tells the story had found Ripans Tabules a specific for
headache, and generally had a Supply on hand: One. day, more ill
joke than in earnest, she said to the afflicted one : "Try these r : - .
they'll cure you." Well, she did try them; and strangely, enough thÂ«. ; . ;
Tabules did cure her. The despondency left her. This was nearly
â¢ year ago. She took less thai) a doUar> wortii in aIL and has aot :': ' ] '"â¢'. :

Washington, D. C., May 2s, -IS&S. ' ' ... ; ? . .
The argument. in question was brought
out by a statement made by A. Dernham,
who said 'that"'- while the promises of : the
people- at Washington are . all â¢ very nice
sounding, they. ia*.-Â«vsui<.enty HI 11. any we
tails,.. 1 or example, in: this city there are
endugh shoes to supply. several regiments'
Of soldiers. When one Of. the ; purchasing
agents for the Government : was ap
proached in the matter 0f. . -furnishing
shoes for the troops for Manila* . he. pro
duced a sample â¢of hand-sewed brogan.
which he said was the. .standard. The
local dealers offered what : they said was
the. equal of the one displayed; but al
} though the price .was only $2.25 per pair,
I the offer was refused, and even a bid on
! the same kind as the sample was refused
\ on the ground that there was no time for
filling the order. The contract was placed
with Wanamaker in the East. for $2.84 per
pair, who had the order filled in Chicago.
, The order was for over 200,000 pairs, which
; were sent to this city, â¢
Mr. Dernham said that when the goods
arrived here he examined the lot .and
found that the -shoes were of the same
pattern and make as those he had offered
to the purchasing agent here for 59 cents
a: pair less. This was a clear profit to
Wanamaker of over $70,000 on the con
tract, to say nothing - of the cost to the
Government of transportation. -S. Nick
elsberg followed by stating that all of
these big contracts are let at- Washington
through the influence of a "pull." An
swers to letters and dispatches are very
assuring, but when it comes to giving out
[ the big contracts the "pull' gets in its
work and California gets- left out in the
cold as usual; â¢ He asked that a resolution
embodying these facts be prepared by
the ;- assembly and! sent â¢ to Washington
with the request . that Justice be done to
the people of the West in the matter of
competition. '.
. This raised a heated discussion, some
wanting to have the matter .politely pre
sented with a request that more : favors
be dispensed this : way and that no one
industry be taken up. but that complaints
be received from all branches of trade,
and. 'a. general complaint be sent to ' the
officials at the heads of -such â¢ matters.
Still others, led by Hugh, Craig and .1. W.
Kerf, believed that the matter should not
be minced, but that the injustice of the
giving of contracts under the present sys
tem be .told in words that could not be
misunderstood. At last the aggressive
clem-nt won an/1 the chairman- was di
rected to appoint a committee whose duty
Is to -give the authorities the facts in the
; rough. He appointed Messrs. Brown.
Pernham, McClosky, Bundschu and
; â Craig.
The latter said that he knows of the
loss of a. J4Q.000 order to this city, through
pique, to Bet even on certain. persons here.
h< -1? i : "I will not . hesitate to expooe
this business in the proper time and man
ner. This man Wanamaker has no s right
to- put h's hand into the Treasury of the
I n-.tec States and take out over 66 cents
.on every pair of shoes sold to "the Gov
ernment. This system of contracts are
aa bad as those by which the Government
-was- robbed of hundreds of thousands of
dollars during the late civil war. ; It is
: a.flne time now to expose the business be-
I lore: the thing goes too far." . - â¢
â¢Mr. McCldsky, .one of -the representa
tives of the hardware industries. - gave
! some valuable experience of his while en
deavoring to convince the authorities at
the capital that the supplies for the In
dian reservations of this oast, could be
bought as cheaply in the West as in the
East He showed that the dealers in the
Eastern cities are very persistent In their
efforts to deprive- tills coast of what lit
tle patronage it has with the Govern^
i ment. He read a long statement showing
that the articles needed by- the Govern
ment can be purchased here as elsewhere
C. A. Wetmore and Charles Bundschu of
the wine makers-body, presented a resolu
tion: adopted by the body-asking the Pres
ident to reconsider his action In the treaty
with France, for if the agreement goes
through as it Stands it will work a very
great injury to the wine, trade of this
coast. The resolution was adopted and
it' will be" sent on to Washington signed
by she representatives of all the com
mercial bodies mentioned. .

a Determined Dash to Do
Some Business.
Judge Belcher's new Grand Jury start
ed off yesterday with a dash which, if

inquisitorial body to do what its prede
cessors had failed to carry out.
At the session yesterday the jury filed

Widber, one for the embezzlement of
176,000, and the other for $13,000. The bail

Hammersmith & Field for that purpose,
but who pawned the watches and skipped
out for Tacoma, where he was arrested
and brought back to this city, had two
indictments filed against him with bail
fixed at $3000 on each indictment.
After the foreman, M. M. Hecht, pre
sented the indictments the jury adjourned

SIMINOFF FAMTXY TROUBLES.
Morris Arrested for Threatening to
Kill Aaron on Sight.
The troubles of the Siminoff brothers
are- not yet. at an end. and' yesterday Mor
ris' was oh a warrant charging
him with threatening to kill his brother
Aaron. He was released on bail. Aaron
declares that Morris carries a revolver
with the avowed Intention of killing him
oh sight. . : ..
Morris' is a cloak manufacturer on Mar
ket street, and Aaron pn Post street.
Some weeks ago Aaron and his brother
Louis were arrested on the complaint of
Morris on two charges of battery, but
after the cases had been continued for
some time they were dismissed. At that
time Aaron had witnesses to prove that
Morris had hired three men to "do him
up." Morris Siminoff denies the story
and has his own version, which is th.it
he simply took means to lawfully defend
himself.
Was the Charge Wrong?.
Ella <^off, a young girl living at 119 Fell
street, was sent to the Ukiah Asylum
yesterday. < It was through her that John
â¢i Bro.wnlie was dismissed from the police
I force about six months ago. The girl told
j the attaches at the hospital Wednesday
j that Brownlie was innocent of the charge
, preferred against him, and that she was
Instigated to bring it by her mother, who
' i wanted Brownlie to marry her. Brown
lie Is being advised by his friends to have
the matter reopened before .the Police
] Commissioners, so that his character
i could at least be cleared.

.â¢" new YORK, June The- tendencies in the I
' etock market to-day; were.; : inu'ch mixed â¢ a.nd at j
' -times-, so.' conflicting .as ito make any. general
view confusing and difficult.' â  It is fair â¢ to'
state, however, that in spite' Of the reactionary
â¢ -course of some stocks!- the- -undertone of j the
market was very firm arid even ' strong: ; â â¢ In .
a general way -It", may. be stated that the high
priced leaders of the- market. . with ! the :.bln- i
ple exception of sugar, came, to .a halt and
even receded, while the .'â  lower-priced stocks,
both in the railroad and industrial lists,; were '
lifted to a" level more â  commensurate -with ; the
;â¢ high "level attained " by''-'. the- leader's: â¢: . ; The-
Grangers, except Burlington,'. : all' closed â lower. l
than last night. Burlington. 'was tain d by
rumors of approaching acutun' toward refunding
some of its interest-bearing' bonds. '. . - :
The very cheap rates \t of . money had- the
"effect of .rewakening interest: in -a number of
refunding and. reorganizing projects .which !
were ahnndoned at- the outbreak of the war.
The low-priced securities, ..especially those, .of
â¢. reorpanizeil railroad. companies, were .taken up ,
in a vigorous way and very generally -aÂ«J- [

; â¢CHICAGO, Juive '2.â Everything In the way
of news in wheat -seemed/ to be bearish td-day
i at the start- land -the sentiment, was In full
' accord with the ' news. Liverpool ' cables
showed 9Ud decline for July and 2' 2 d in Sep
tember. : In addition there 'was a report from
â New York that foreigners 'were' selling at the
seaboard., the continued promise of a- big
1 wheat and indications .of ' an. early har
vest In â  the South, and Southwest. All thin
created a "weak sentiment, resulting in actiye
liquidation, short selling and sales on stop-loss
orders, which .led to partial demoralization.
.July, which closed at Sl%QI2c yesterday, sold
[down-, to -S7C, and . September declined IV-
Elowever, there were short's galore, -and every
1 one had profit on their previous sales and saw
j fit to "take It.' Buying of that sort arid against
weekly puts turned - the market firm. belter
brokers gave occasional support to July when
'â  'it needed It. The shorts in September gave
1 that .option the support that it stood in need
! of every time it got under S7c. July closed at
"i l g 1 92 c. .September closed *Â»@Vic higher at
79c. â¢
NVeakness in corn .early was due to the
heaviness of wheat. There was quite general
buying later . and the market became strong.
â¢July closed "fee higher.
After a weak opening oats rallied with corn,
closing unchanged.
It looked at the start as if every broker In
the provision pit had. orders to sell pork. Prices
suffered a severe decline. Pork is 30c and ribs
'5c lower and lard unchanged. .

DRINKING IN FRANCE.
The income received by the State last
year in France from wine, beer, cider
and spirits shows the amount consumed
and indicates the drinking habits of the
different parts of the country. While
the total consumption has increased,
beer seems to be graining on wine, and
spirits on beer. The southern depart
ments and the wine-growing districts
still favor the national drink. In Her
ault 277 liters of wine are drunk by each
j inhabitant every year. The Gironde
comes next with 210 liters. In some of
the northern departments, on the other
hand, wine is at a discount. In the
Nord the annual consumption of beer is
252 liters a head, and the neighboring
I departments follow some way behind.
In ten southern departments beer is a
quantite negligeable. Generally speak
! ing, the beer drinking departments in
| the north are also at the top of the list !
for spirits.. Each Parisian, drinks 202
liters of wine and seven liters of spirits
annually.. Cider drinking is going out !
of fashion. The average consumption j
per head for the whole population is:
Wine 89. litersi beer 24 liters, cider 14
liters and spirits 4 liters. Spirits bring
I the most revenue â 5 shillings 8 pence
1 per head, as compared with 3 shillings
! 2 pence per head for wine. 6 pence per
head for beer and 3 pence per ho ad for
cider. The growing consumption of
: strong spirits' and the drunkenness
which "'follows have led the Government j
to lower the duty on wine and increase *
the charge on alcoholic liquors.â St. j

FOR HIS WIFE
Lundquist's Thrift Was a
Boomerang.
NOW FREEZING UP NORTH
THE DESERTED WOMAN ASKS
FOR A DIVORCE.
Has Attached Three Years' Sav
ings That He Himself Had
No Chance to
Spend.
_ Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
; '' . 908 Broadway, June 2. â¢
; : C. E. Lundquist, who Is Imprisoned In
some little whaling station In the Arctic,
will no doubt be very much disconcerted
when he learns that his savings of three
years, which are. now In the. safe of the
Pacific. Whaling Company, have been at
tached by his wife, and the company served
with an injunction to hold the money un
til further orders of court: â 'â /..' ... "â¢â¢ ..
Three years ago Lundquist and his wifa
disagreed, and Lundquist, without telling
his. wife where he was going, departed
for Alaska. He succeeded. in obtaining a
position with a trading company, and has
bt>en. working -steadily : ever since. Being
away from Civilization and socially burled
among forests, glaciers and Indians,
Lundquist has had no opportunity to
M>end his salary, which has consequently
been steadily accumulating, until now
there is $700 to. his credit in his employer's
office in San Francisco; .. ' .
: Mrs.. Lundquist discovered her hus
band's, whereabouts,, and as he has- not
made any effort for three years to sup
port her or their little children, she re
cently applied for a divorce through her
attorney, E. C, Hblman. More recently
Mrs. Lundquist discovered that it was
possible for her to get some of her hus
band's . money, and to-day an injunction
â was served on the whaling company for
bklding it to dispose of the money.
â  Mrs. Lundquist is; very modest In her
demands, ; asking only $15 a month all
mony and fees. . â .â â¢â â¢â  â¢â¢.â¢â .â .â¢..â ..:â â¢.. â¢ â  â â .

t rth this week to complete the work of
:g abdominal bandages, which are
wanted In Camp Merritt Saturday. The
: committee will meet to-morrow at>
â  â¢ residence of Mrs. Emma Shafter
.;â¢!. i."i Alice street, to outline their
: work.
The application of Mrs. Spofford of
â¢ lej for aid from the county gave
the bevy of young ladies who style them
ea the Young Ladies' Relief Society
Aid of the Wives and Children of.
Volunteers their first opportunity to show
their colors. The society was organized
a week ago by Miss Irene Baker, Miss
Grace Gqrrlll, Miss Bertha Mcjslratn,
Miss Florence Sharon, Miss Edith Selby,
Miss Jean Howard, Miss Jennie Crellin.
and yesterday they supplied the deserted
wife with clothing, money and some one
to watch her until she was sufficiently re
covered to care for herself. The society |
is receiving substantial recognition, and I
will work Independently among the do- I
serving families Tvho are dependent upon ,'
r their support, outside of the !
Red Crops' jurisdiction as well as In it. !
They have an advisory board of older ;
members, who are members of th-
Cross, and they themselves are fully in 'â 
â  1 with their v."rk. Hut they f.-.-l
that they rah reach out more among fam
ilies by being separate.
Kohn BrbthQrs have notified Battalion
Adjutant Vaugh of tho Fifth Infantry

Flags for Netjraskans.
; OAKLAND, June 2.â Some of the young
ladies of the Oakland Red Cross Society
ited fourteen large Red Cross flags
to-day to the Nebraska ngiment In San
Francisco. The young ladies heard that
the troops from Nebraska were without
Red cross emblems, and so they formed:
themseiy.es into a society called the A Bj
K. to make Hags and bandages. When the j
Hags were presented to-day before the i
soldiers Major F. A. Snyder, the chief j
Surgeon of the regiment, accepted them *

remarks. He told them that the Ne- |
ka people had failed to provide them
with the hospital, flags, ana that it re
mained for the young ladies of Oakland
to do so: He promised to carry the flags
back with the regiment to Nebraska and
tell the Nebraska people that tf it had not
been for the assistance of Oakland ladies
with medicines the hospital corps would
have been In sore traits. He thanked

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 3, 1898.
HARRY THOMAS
IS ON TRIAL
Talesmen's Politics Are
Being Searched.
A HAPPY FARMER TALKS
HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE
OAKLAND SCANDALS.
Strong Array of Counsel on Behalf of
the Defendant and Indications
of a Bitter Con
1 test.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 2.
The trial of Harry Thomas, secretary of
the Board of Public Works, for suborna
tion of perjury under an Indictment by
the Grand Jury, promises to be fought out
laregly on political lines. During the ex
amination of talesmen to-day, politics
were very conspicuous. The political af
filiations of . the talesmen were closely
searched and along those lines they were
accepted or excused.
Mayor Thomas was in court with his son
end almost as many questions were asked
regarding the acquaintance of possible
jurors with the father as with the son.
Attorneys. M. C. Chapman, Emil Nus
baumer and A. L. Trick are taking care
lof the defendant's Interests, while the
people are represented by Deputies L. S.
Church and A. A. Moore, Jr.
Considerable amusement was afforded
the bench and the lobby by the examina
tion of J. Donlan, a farmer of Murray
Township.
Mr. Donlan says he had never heard
anything of the case till he came in court
this morning. He remembered seeing
some headlines about it a few months- ago,
but he plainly inferred that he did not
think Oakland political scandals deserving
of any serious attention. When asked if
he would prefer to convict or to acquit the
defendant, Mr. Donlan replied: "Well, I
am a laying for these fellows If they are
guilty." The court was asked by Mr.
Chapman to repeat the remark, which he
did, and Mr. Donlan by way of explana
tion, said that he was in favor of always
convicting the guilty and letting the Inno
cent go free, "Although it seems to me
that this ain't nlways the case."
Mr. Donlan further stated that he knew
Judge Xushaumer's father and mother
well, but he knew nothing about "the
boy." "The boy" is about 50 years of a;;e
and is a leading counsel for the defpnd
ant. After a thorough examination Judge
Nusbaumer excused Mr. Donlan.
Another Juror, Mr. Doanes, of East Oak
land, was excused because he had done
some politics for Mr. Dow, whom the de
fendant's attorneys fear is interested in
securing the conviction of Harry Thomas.
Several members of the Grand Jury
have been subpoenaed and several mem
bers of the police force, as well as ex-
Chief Lloyd, have also been subpoenaed.
Harry Thomas was mildly scored by
Judge Ellsworth this afternoon for not
appearing on time. The court waited for
fifteen minutes and then asked, of the
attorneys for the defense, "Gentlemen,
have you any idea as to the whereabouts
of your client?'.' Judge Nusbaumer re
plied that they had not, but were expect
ing him any minute. Forty-five minutes
after the court had convened, Harry
Thomas walked Into the court room and
took his seat.
Judge Ellsworth said, "Mr. Thomas, the
court would Jike to know why you nave
thus detained it." "I do not know, your
Honor," replied Thomas. "But we must
know," said Judge Ellsworth.
"I was not aware that I was detaining
the court, not knowing at what time it
met," said the defendant.
The Judge warned him to be careful not
to repeat the offense and the examination
of jurors continued.
POTRERO AVENUE
EXTENSION OPINION.
THE LEGAL STATUS DEFINED
BY THE COUNTY ATTOBNEY.
Property-Owners Along the Proposed
Line Will Now Be Able to See
Their Way Clear.
The great anxiety of the property own
ers on the line of Potrero avenue from
Ninth street to the county line over the
extension of that thoroughfare, which
project has been in a cloudy condition for
the last eight years, has at last been re
lieved by light thrown on its legal statua
by the City and County Attorney.
The opinion was liled with the super
visors at the .request of the property
owners.
The following Is the opinion of the City
and County Attorney:
SAN FRANCISCO, June 2, 189 S.
To the Board pÂ£ Supervisors: I am In re
ceipt of resolution No. 1055 (fourth series) of
the board, a portion of which asks "why Po
trero avenue has not been opened, and the
condition of the law respecting the same."
This Inquiry of the board contains two ques
tions, each of which I will anewer separately.
Firstâ \Vhy Potrero avenue has not been
opened?
Answer â On November 6, 1891, the board pass
ed a resolution of intention, No. ."â '.MS (third ser
ies), declaring Its Intention to open and extend
Potrero avenue from New Channel street to
Ninth street, and from Twenty-fifth street to
the county line. These proceedings were taken
under the provisions of the street opening act
of March 6, 1889 (Sta^s. 18K9, p. 70). After
proper publication and notice In accordance
with the provisions of that act order No. 2413
of the board was passed ordering this avenue
opened and extended In accordance
with the declared Intention of the board.
Amonj other matters this order In section 1
thereof provided: "The Bald avenue and
streets as extended embracing all the hind in
cluded In the boundaries hereinafter described
Is hereby condemned, appropriated, acquired,
set apart and taken for public use."
This provision Of order No. 24U3 In Identical
with tlie provision contained In order No 2310
declaring Market, street from Seventeenth and
Castro to the Pacific Ocean an open public
Street The provision In order No. 2319 was
passed upon by the Supreme Court of Califor
nia In the case of Wulzen vs. Supervisors, 10l
Cal. 15. The court held that the order of' the
Board of Supervisors of the City and County
of San Francisco, purporting to open and ex
tend MarkPt street to the ocean, and declaring
that all the lund within Its exterior bounda
ries, as extend'-d, "Is hereby condemned, ap
propriated, acquired, set apart and takfn for
public use," is Judicial In its nature In, so far
as It purports to condemn the land described,
and to that extent Is In excess of the Jurisdic
tion of the board. The proceedings to open
and extend Market street %vere therefore de
clared Illegal and void.
Inasmuch as order No. 2433 for the opening
and extension of Potrero avenue contains the
same provision as order No. 2319 for the open-
Ing and extension of Market street, It follows
that order 2493 and all proceedings taken there
under are likewise null und void.
A comprehensive history of other proceedings
for the opening of Potrero avenue, consisting
of twenty-four pug.-* of printed matter, pre
pared by John A. Kussell Esq. with admirable
clearness and accuracy, can be found in the
appendix to the municipal reports of 1894-6.
Tills history shows the beginning and ending
of various attempts by the board to open
Potrero avenue Irom the southerly Him of
Serpentine uvenue to the northerly line of
Army street.
Secondâ What is the condition of the law re
specting the same?
Answer- Proceedings for the extension of
Potrero avenue were taken under the pro
visions of the act of March 23, 1891, This aft
was confined In its operation to municlpaliti* s
of 40,000 inhabitants and over, was special
legislation and therefore unconstitutional, and
the proceedings had thereunder for the open- I
Ing of Potrt-ro avenue were, In the case of j
Helen A. lenders vs. Board of Supervisors et
al., held to be illegal ajjd void. (See opinion
of attorney and counselor of the board dated
September 23, 1895.)
By the terms of this act of the Legislature
It is made applicable only to "any municipality
or city and cities and counties containing over
40,000 Inhabitants," atid manifestly it was the
lnttnt of the Legislature that it shr.uid. In
such political subdivisions, supersede the street
opening act of 18S9. This intent was empha
sized by clauses therein specially relieving
from the operation of the act of ISS9 all munici
palities containing 40,000 Inhabitants or over.
The act of liii) being unaffected by the uro
visions of the unconstitutional act of March
23 IS9S, is now in full force and effect.
It furnishes a full and complete though ex
pensive system for the opening of streets.
The Supreme Court of California has recently
held that this is not the only method by which
a street may be opened, but that it would he
accomplished by condemnation proceeding's
taken under title VII. part 111 of the Code of
Civil Procedure. The decision referred to reads
as follows:
"The provisions of thÂ« act of March Â«, 18S9,
are not exclusive, and were not designed to pro
hibit a municipality from maintaining con
demnation proceedings under the provisions of
the Code of Civil Procedure. It may and will
usually happen that a municipality proposing
to open a new street will adopt the machinery
provided for by the statute, if for no other
reasons than that It contemplates the forma
tion of an assessment district, and the imposi
tion of the cost of the opening of the street
upon the property of that district. But, upon
the other hand, if it shall happen that a
municipality has in its treasury funds available
for the proposed condemnation and opening of
a street, no good reason can be seen why it
should not pay these expenses out of itH treas
ury and relieve property owners of the unneces
sary burden of taxation."

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 2.
The politicians were in evidence again
to-day, after having spent three days in
San Francisco, during which time Oak
land was completely deserted. Never has
It been so apparent that this is a city of
politicians as during the early part of
this week, especially around the county
buildings, the desire to appear at the Re
publican League Convention animating
Superior Judges and janitors alike.
Now that the convention is past the
Republican politicians are trying to dis
cover what they have accomplished. One
wing characterizes the proceedings as a
political mountebank show, the other
wing declares that it has accomplished
yeoman service toward bringing the nom
ination for Governor to this county. Hap
pily every one is satisfied. The Davis
men declare that their candidate has
benefited largely, while the Pardee men
declare that they can nominate their man
without a contest in the State Conven
tion.
The conservative element, however, Is
wondering whether the outburst of en
thusiasm from Alameda County was Ju
dicious and whether It had encouraged
other candidates in other parts of the
State to believe that the local breach will
never be healed, and that in future com
putations regarding the coveted nomina
tion Alameda may be counted out.
Everybody Is now interested in the call-
Ing of the primaries, and as to whether
the State Central Committee will so
frame the call that the County Central
Committee will be at liberty to have
State delegates elected in such a manner
as to insure a unit delegation.
To-morrow night the Young Men's Re
publican League has arranged a big rally
at Hamilton Hall. The league, with a
band, will march to the local train and
escort Hon. Tirey L. Ford, the orator of
the evening, to the hall. Short speeches
will also be made by George \Y. Reed,
E. K. Taylor, A. I* Frlck and others.
The vice-presidents selected by Presi
dent A. H. Breed show that he has car
ried out his promise that the league shall
not be manipulated in the interests of
either Davis or Pardee, for it contains the
most prominent names of men supporting
either party. They are as follows:

While the Republicans are busy trying
to harmonize, the Populists are trying to
bring some order out of the chaotic con
fusion of the fusion of two years ago.
Last night a meeting was held and
Messrs. Gregory and Bretz crossed swords
over the old fusion proposition. The fol
lowing resolution was .framed and will
be sent to the various ward clubs for
action, after which it will be reported
back to the Central Committee:, â 
Resolved, That inasmuch as the People's
party is a distinct political party advocating
reformatory principles totally unlike those of
Republican or Democratic parties, therefore we
deem it not only inexpedient but destructive
both to our organization and our principles to
fuse, co-operate, or In any way associate with
either of the two old parties.
Resolved, That the present duty of the Peo
ple's party Is to reassert Its principles and
prove to the country that It is In no way allied
to either of the old parties and worthy of the
support of true reformers.

San Franciscos Will Give No Time
Allowances to Yachts.
At a meeting of the directors of the San
Francisco Yacht Club held yesterday at
the Merchants' Exchange there were
present:
Commodore Dr. T. L. Hill, Treasurer R.
B. Hogue, Financial Secretary W. Q. Mor
row and Measurer J. M. Punnett. The
resignation of Lieutenant McCully, form
erly of the United States coast survey
vessel McArthur, but now of the United
States navy, was accepted. The McAr
thur, while engaged in surveying the bay
of San Francisco, for a long time made
her headquarters at Sausalito. Wakefleld
Baker was elected a member of the club.
There was considerable discussion about
the publication of a book to contain the
by-laws of the club as approved at its lo.nt
general meeting, a catalogue of the yachts
In the fleet and their measurements and a
list of members; but no definite conclusion
was arrived at. Several bills were ap
proved and ordered paid.
A jinks Is to be given at the clubhouse
at Sausaltto on the evening of Saturday,
June 28, and a regatta, open to all the
clubÃ on the bay, on Sunday, June 26. It
was suggested that the yachts in each
class should have their time taken from
the firing of the signal gun for that class
and that there should be no time allow
ances. If this suggestion is adopted yacht
racing will become a much more interest
ing and Intelligible sport to spectators
without any technical knowledge than it
has hitherto been. Under the system now
In vogue a yacht may cross the finishing
line ahead of everything else and cover
the course in a shorter time than any of
its competitors, and yet, when the time
keepers have concluded their calculations,
be adjudged last In the race.
Their Marriage a Failure.
A suit for absolute divorce with ali
mony was filed yesterday afternoon by
Mary B. Ruhling against her husband,
Frederick W. E. Ruhling, on the grounds
of cruelty and failure to properly provide

BRUTALITY AT SEA.
Captain Dickinson Held for Trial fcr
Beating a Member of His Crew
in a Cruel Manner.
Captain W. R. Dickinson of the Amer
ican ship Aryan was held to answer yes
terday by United States Commissioner
Heacock to a charge of beating and
wounding a sailor named Charles Dunn
on the high seas.
The testimony was to the effect that
while the vessel was off Cape Horn in a
squall Dunn and another member of the
crew were ordered to take in sail in a
hurry. They were so slow about it that
the captain naturally became impatient
and gave him a shove. About twenty or
twenty-five minutes afterward while
Dunn was at the wheel he and the cap
tain had a discussion as to the shoving
of Dunn to one side by the captain,
whereupon the captain, according to his

REFUSES TO
REMAIN PASSIVE
Undertaker Kelly Fights
Supervisors.
HIS ATTORNEY FILES A BRIEF
DECLINES TO HAVE HIS BID
THROWN OUT.
Some Strong Beasons Given Why
Ha Should Be Allowed to
Bury the Indigent
Dead.
It would seem that Edward Kelly, the
undertaker, whose bid to bury the Indi
gent dead was thrown out by the Board
of Supervisors on two occasions, does not
Intend to abide by their action, but pro
poses to fight diligently in the hope of
securing his just rights.
Through his attorney, John W. Bour
dette, he has filed an interesting letter
and brief with city and County Attorney
Creswell, whose opinion has been asked
by the Supervisors on the subject, and
which sets forth strongly views with
reference to awarding the contract and
strenuously objects to the abuse of dis
cretion and the unjust discrimination on
the part of the Supervisors in the matter.
Following is a portion of the communi
cation:
: : SAN FRANCISCO, June. 2, .1698. -
H ' T. CrÂ«Ewell,- City- and. County .Attorney,
\.w City Hall. .Cityâ Dear Sir: . As the at-.
torney â â : Edward Keiiy I. request the. privilege
of. piv'seVting'.'to you pome facts and authorities
on the iiuestion of awarding the- contract- lor
the burial of the indigent dead, which ques
tion, I am informed; .Was referred to you. . by
order of the Board of Supervisors of the city
and county at San Francisco for your opinion...
â  .Some /objections .have been â¢'â¢ made against
awarding, said :' contract .to. Edward- Kelly, the
lowest bidder,: on the ground, that- he has not
' en( aged in the ; undertaking business in. . this
city and county and conducting said' business
In a reputable "manner for a period of at least
six months immediately: preceding; the date of
advertising eaiii, proposal; â¢â -â .-â â¢ .-â¢â  . ' ' '' ...
: . Under resolution No. 16.291, third series, the
Board of Supervisors- did advertise for bids in
conformity : with, said . resolution; and in pursu
ance, thereof said Edward Kelly did make and
file, his bid and, asked, to be awarded- said con
tract. Upon the respective: bids being opened
by the Committee on Health and Police it was
found that only two bids, namely, the. bid of
the Pacific Undertaking . Company in the sum
of 515 50 a.nd that of Edward Kelly in the sum
of $â¢; 65, had been .filed. Said committee, upon
canvassing the same, entertained a protest for
and on behalf of said' Pacific Undertaking
Company against, awarding â¢ the contract to
Edward Kelly, the . lowest bidder, lon the
ground that he did not come within the re
quirements .of said proposal,- namely:- "No
bids will be considered from any party who
has riot engaged in : the .undertaking business
in this city and county and conducted said
business In a reputable manner for a period of
at least six months immediately preceding the
date hereof. '.' .' Thereupon said committee did,
through its expert, make an investigation of
the business carried on by said Kelly, and said
expert did make and file his report. . Thereupon
further testimony was Introduced on behalf of
said Kelly, showing that he was duly qualified
and: capable of performing all of the require
ments of said contract. Said committee there
upon rejected all bids and readverti?ed, with
: the result . that Edward Kelly was again- the
.lowest bidder, and â  he asks that said. contract
he awarded to him, and states that' he is
ready and willing to comply with all the re
quirements of the board for the faithful* per
formance of the obligations to ; be imposed by.
virtue of said contract.. - â¢',â â¢â¢â  -. .'....â¢
: Mr. Bourdette then touches on the legal
phases of his client's case, and concluding
says: ';: â '-â¢â -â .â¢:.. :'.-.. â  . - ; - ;.'. ; - ; .:-.
?-.' ..*,â¢.*â¢ It is useless for me to call your at
tention to .the law upon the subject, for the
reason that I am satisfied you will give that I
. question the serious consideration. Whteh .It
â â  .deserves. . i .would call ' your attention to., the
decision :of ' Judge Belcher rendered in the case
â ' of Samuel O. Irving vs. Board of State Harbor
: Commissioners;., rendered- April .23, 1S?8. and to
â the concluding. portion thereof ,'â â¢. .. â ' .'. '. . ' : '
; .'.: : - Under all the : fact* and : circumstances In I
â¢ this, case, I. am : Seriously in doubt as to whether !
'â 'or.-., riot:" the contract awarded .under the notice j
and pnjposals as- advertised 'would be .valid and '

its facf. for the : reasons hereinbefore stated.'. :

The Old Company Is Being Reorgan

Governor May Direct.
A movement is on foot to organize the
old Frar.klin Guard Into an active mili
tary body, and whon so organized to ten
der it to the Governor of the State for
duty at any place that he or the United
States authorities may designate for
active duty. The movement assumed par
tial Bhape at the armory on Page and
Gough streets last night, when Captain
Fr.tnk P. Shafer and First Lieutenant
William A. Rurdick of the old company
sent out an informal notice to as many
of the ex-members as they found within
a limited radius of the city. The call was
responded to by about fifty of the boys
who had worn the uniform in days gone
by, and Who .signified their intention of at
bhde joining again to aid their coun
try in time of need.
it is the intention of Captain Shafer and
Lieutenant Burdick to enroll 100 men and
then proceed to elect a second lieutenant
and appoint the requisite complement of
non-commissioned officers, after which
the company will be reported to the Gov
ernor for active duty.
The Franklin Guard is the second oldest
company in the city, it having been or
ganized in ISS9. and out of its ranks 123
men joined the army during the Civil
War. General McComb was its captain
j n it' s earliest days, and the old colors
that were carried in days gone by are still
in the possession of the company. By
next Monday the company will have 100
men enrolled on its roster. â â  : â¢.

DEFIED THE POLICE.
W. H. Mahoney, an Attorney, Ar
rested for Oostructing the
. Streets.
W. H. Mahoney, an attorney, was ar
rested yesterday afternoon by Police Of
fW-r W: J. Smith and charged with ob
structing the street. Mahoney was watch
ing the Dakota troops as they were pass
ing along Market street and refused to j
move "when told to do bo by Smith. The
.latter claims Mahoney defied him to ar
rest him, and even: threatened to-"break
him" if he placed his hands on him.
Smith at once placed turn uruier areet
and took him to Captain Spillane's office.
After listening to the officer's story, the
captain of the Southern station ordered
him to charge the attorney with obstruct

ney's arrest, visited the City Prison and
ordered his release on his own recogniz
ance. Mahoney claims that the policeman

A COOL MOTORMAN.
His Presence of Mind Averted What
Might Have Been a Fearful
Accident.
The motormnn on car 2S of the San Ma
teo and San Francisco electric line has
convinced the â  authorities of that road
that he possesses sufficient presence of
mind to entitle him to the consideration
of the company"s officers.
The particulars in. which this man dis
tinguished himself occurred yesterday
afternoon at 4 o'clock at the crossing of
the electric line with that Of the South
ern Pacific road at Ocean View. At the
time mentioned the electric car approach
ed the crossing, and the conductor, see
ing that a i rain bound south had just
passed, and that the gates were again
opened, signaled to the motorman to go
ahead. Just as the electric car reached
the middle of the crossing the gates were
suddenly closed, and the passengers were
horrified to see a train bound into the
city coming at full speed round the curve, i
not over three hundred feet away. The
motorman had presence of mind enough
to send his car forward with a Jerk, |
breaking away the gates and smashing I
the forward windows of the car. but for- !
tunately clearing the railroad train by the
narrowest kind of a margin, but In time j
to get clear of the approaching train, j
which had in the meantime slackened Its ,
speed somewhat.
Beyond a slight scare on the part of !
some of the passengers no damage was
dolie, save the -breaking of a few panes of
glass In the front windows.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 3, 1898.
CONFESSION AND
ITS HORRORS
Father Yorke Battles
Against Ignorance.
THE CONFESSION AS IT IS
SHOWS MANY ABSURDITIES OF
GENERAL BELIEF.
Explains the Mission and Duties
of the Priest nnd the Po
sition of the
Penitent-
The horrors of the confessional was the
somewhat novel and Interesting subject of
the Third District Lecture, under the
auspices of the Catholic Truth Society,
delivered last evening at Metropolitan
Temple by Father Yorke.
The lecture was a broad and minute dis
cussion and definition of the confessional
as it really is, and as others represent it.
The contention of Protestants generally
that the confessional is purely an institu
tion called into existence by the clergy of
the Catholic Church for the purpose of
obtaining the private and family secrets
of the laity was eloquently refuted, and
the absurdity of the belief, declared by
the speaker, who made citations from
nearly every book of the Bible.
"The very theme of the Bible," said
the lecturer, "Is based on the confessional,
which teaches that the only possible
means of satisfying for sin is through the
blood of Jesus Christ. God is infinite, and
being such, demands an infinite satisfac
tion. This, man alone, cannot do; but
through the mercy and goodness of God
in sending His Son, the second person of
the Blessed Trinity, the means of obtain
ing forgiveness has been granted him
through the blood of the Savior. The mere
redemption of sin by the death of Christ
does not moan that man can enter the
Kingdom of Heaven, It simply opens the
Kititi'. the entrance to wrtucn comes
through the confessional and absolution.
"Protestants speak of t'ne confessional
as a horrible trap where the priests enter
one door, the penitent another, and by a
base jugglery the sinner is sent and
turned out the opposite side a saint. When
Cutholics who are not versed in their re
ligion are confronted with the question,
"How can a priest do thisâ how can he
forgive sin?' they are at a loss for an an
swer. The reply is simple: "Who said
that he could and when was It said? 1 The
priest is given the power to either forgive
or retain sin, as the representative of
Christ, and consequently must be a
Judge. In order to judge, it is absolutely
necessary for the sinner to confess. Al
thougn the priest has been given power to
confess sins, lie has not been given the
powers of a mind reader, and when a sin
ner kneels before him he must confess his
sins aloud. Confession is simply made by
telling tht name and character of the sin
and the number of times committed, and
is, therefore, a mere persona! list of
transgressions without any mention of
circumstance! leading up to them or the
mention of names. It is not necessary, as
non-Catholics generally believe, that a
man must tell everything he has done
since the last time he went to confession,
naming all his family affairs and the
names of those who were associated or
were instrumental in his committing the
sin. Neither names nor circumstances
are ever mentioned, and are never asked
by tne priest unless they cnange the na
ture of the sin. Family affairs need never
be mentioned, and the priest is none the
wiser of a person's family or private af
"Non-Catholics may not acknowledge
the practice of the confessional, but in
theory they are compelled to support it.
The Catholics, dictated by the teachings
of the Bible, claim that all deadly sin
must be confess.nl, and why? Because it
is a commandment of Jesus Christ.
"Catholics who go to confession and
live up to their religion know and under
stand all these things, but those of other
creeds who do not understand the true
character of the confessional look upon
it as a horror ;ind an infernal machine,
seeing in it an engine of the devil invent
ed for the purpose of fostering priest
craft upon the world.
"In conclusion I would claim that
through nineteen centuries the confess
ional has been a means of grace. When
we confess our souls to God we have the
physical exultation, strength and relief
that come to us through Him and Him
alone. It Is a flag to which we can all
cling. It is one of the greatest dispensa
tions that Jesus Christ has given up."
As a prelude to the lecture Father
Torke outlined the work of the Catholic
Truth Society at the camp of the national
troops at Richmond and the hopes of the
society in affording the Catholic hoys at
the camp a means of obtaining the. sac
raments and attending mass on the
grounds in the near future. A tont is
already being pitched on the grounds
which the lecturer remarked with pride
is the largest there.
Religious services, which have been
held at camp for the past two Sundays,
will be continued, and mass will be said
in the morning. Priests will be In camp
every day and will minister to the wants
of soldiers. An appeal was made to Cath
olics generally for aid in helping defray
the expense of conducting the services
and distributing Catholic literature
among the soldiers. Articles of all kinds
can be given to the boys through the me
dium of the pociety by sending them
either to the Flood building or to the la
dies at camp.
Father Yorke, approximating the num
ber of Catholic soldiers in the First Regi
ment, emphasized the following statistics
in order that there would be absolutely
not the slightest possibility of their being
as grossly exaggerated as those appear
ing under his name in the past:
"In the First Regiment that left San
Francisco," he said, "seventy-five per
cent of the men were Catholics. They
had a Catholic chaplain to accompany
them. In the other regiments the per
centage was smaller. In some companies
there are only a few Catholics, while in
others they form perhaps half. In the
â whole army the percentage is greater
than that for tho general population. Out
of sixteen hundred men between here and
the Philippines 600 at least are Catholics."
ANSWEBS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
FOOD FOR PARROTSâ F. W., Eadoria.
Wash. A writer on birds says: In their
native country parrots feed upon the
seeds of the sunflower and the various
grains, and with exercise in the wild
state do not grow too fleshy. Caged,
they must be fed vastly different. A good
food for parrots is cold boiled potatoes,
stale bread or crackers, soaked some
times in water, sometimes in milk, and
sometimes in coffee, using the coffee Just
us it is leached or boiled, without the ad
dition of milk or sugar. Bread soaked in
coffee is a delica.te morsel of which par
rots are very fond. They also like canary
Reed, unhulled rice, cracked corn and
hemp seed. Of the two latter very little
should be given them, and they should
never have fed to them greasy food from
the table, sugar, cake, candy or the like.
Peanuts, forming a part of their native
feed, can always be given to them. They
should not be too highly fed.
WARSHIP TONNAGEâ A. S., Tulare,
Cal. Tonnage displacement as applied to
warships means the quantity of a liquid
that is displaced by a solid body placed in
It. If the weight of the displacement is
greater than or equal to that of the body,
the latter will float, if less It will sink
to the bottom like a stone. A buoyant
material sinks to a level where the pres
sure of the fluid displaced is sufficient to
counter-balance its weight.
GERMAN WAR VESSELSâ Kenna
Mine. The following is a list of the flrst-
Ciass war vessels of the German navy,
together with the speed of each in knots:
Battleshipsâ Brandenburg, 16.5 knots;
Deutschland. 14.5: Frederlch der Grosse,
18. Cruisersâ Kaiser, 14.6: Koenig Wilhelm,
17 7. Barbette shipsâ Wilhelm, 18; Fred
erich Wilhelm, 16; Wirth. 17.2; Weisen
berg, speed not given.
FINDING MONETâ Subscriber, Selma.
Cal. In California the laws says that
"a person who flnda lost money or other
property must make affidavit of the fact
before a Justice of the Peace, whose duty
it becomes to post the fact at the court
house and other public places, and, if
the property or money is less than $20,
then it reverts to the finder if not claimed
within thirty days. If of greater value
than $20 the property must be advertised
in a newspaper, and if not claimed with
in a year it reverts to the finder."
THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDSâ C. H.
S. , City. If a young man wants to go to
the Philippine Islands "with a view to
rising either in business or politically, in
case the United States retains the isl
ands," he will have to depend upon his
own exertions in civil life to advance him
self, for no one is so much helped &a the
one who helps himself. If he has "a
moderate amount of influence at "Wash
ington, D. C," he might use that Influ
ence to secure a political position.
HERRMANNâ W., Oakland, Cal. Alex
ander Herrmann, the magician, was born
in Paris, France, in 1844. and died on a
railroad train near Great Valley Decem
ber 17, 1898. He was the son of a physi
cian who performed sleight of hand for
amusement. He made his first appear
ance in St. Petersburg. Russia. He came
to the United States iii 1861 and made his
first appearance at the Academy of
Music. His wife assisted him in all his
tricks on the stage

City. To be promoted from the eighth
to the ninth grade in San Francisco's
public schools the pupil must have at
tained at least 75 per cent, A pupil who

of 500 degrees. Fahrenheit. It is readily
soluble in water and yields a thick liquid
resembling mucilage.
SCHOOL TRUSTEEâ T., Templeton,
Cal. There is nothing in the law
that prohibits a candidate for School

the Board of Election officers, to decline
to serve.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 3, 1898.
INNOCENCE AND DEATH MEET
Antonio Pellettieri, a Four-Year-Old Bou. Killed
Before His Brothers' Eves.
While on his way home from school Antonio, the four-year-old son of Mrs.
Colombo Pellettieri, fell on the track of the Presidio and Ferries railroad at the
corner of Montgomery avenue and Green street and a passing car struck and
killed him instantly. The little fellow's head was directly over the cable slot
after ho fell, and it was hit by the coupling liar of the dummy and the upper por
tion of the skull was nearly torn off by the force of the blow. Charles Ander
son, the gripman, slopped the car as quickly as he could after he saw the boy
fall and prevented the wheels from striking the body.
Antonio, with two brothers, Jimmie and Louis, 7 and 5 years old, had been
attending the <'hildren's Day Home and Kindergarten at 1413 Powell street. The
three started home together about 5 o'clock last evening, Jimmie, the elder, hold
ing Antonio by the hand. When they -reached Montgomery avenue and Green
street the younger boy broke away from his brothers and started across the
Btreet, His foot caught between the car track and a cobble stone. He fell
headlong on the traok and was crushed to death before his brothers' ej-eÂ».
Eye witnesses have different stories of the affair, some saying that the boy
who was killed was behind the other two boys, who had crossed the street
ahead of him. but little Jimmie. who is heartbroken over the death of his
brother, says that he and Louis were behind Antonio. The gripman is exonerated
from all blame by those who saw the accident, and he is given the credit of hav
lng stopped the car in remarkably short order.
The mother, who is a widow of but two months, was but a short distance
from the scene of her boy's death, and the shock has almost driven her insane.
She bad started for the school to bring the boys home, as was her custom, but
was detained a trifle later than usual, and reached the corner where the accident
happened just after the car had struck the boy. When she made her way
through the crowd which had collected around the body and discovered that it
was her son who had been killed she fell on the street in a dead faint and was
carried to the home of her brother-in-law at 643 Green street. Up to a late hour
she had spoken to no one, but was continually moaning and crooning a mournful
Italian death song. It is feared that her mind will not be able to stand the shock.
The family has been very poor since the death of the father, and since that
time Rosie, the 14-year-old daughter of Mrs. Pellettieri has been supporting the
family by what she earned working in a biscuit factory. The little girl is
bearing up bravely under the death of her brother, though her drawn face tells
that she is keeping her grief deep in her heart. She said that Antonio was vie
favorite .if the entire family, and was loved by all the sisters at the school, as
he was unusually bright for a child of his age. La-it Monday the family were at
the cemetery to decorate the. newly made grave of the father, and Antonio, as
small as he was, seemed to have a presentiment that he was going to die. "As
he picked some wild flowers growing near the grave," Rosie said, "and put them
on the mound Antonio looked up at mamma and said, 'I'm going to see papa
this week.' "
Charles Anderson, thÂ« gripman was arrested Immediately after the accident
and charged at the City Prison with manslaughter. On learning of his arrest,
Judge Low at once released him on his own recognizance. According to the state
ment ot" Anderson, the car was going at a slow rate of speed when lie noticed ttie
unfortunate boy crossing the street. He applied the brake, but too late to save
his life.
WINE GROWERS
TAKE ACTION.
â^â â^â
CONGRESS REQUESTED TO MODI
FY RECIPROCITY MEASURE.
Strong Resolutions Adopted by Sev
eral Commercial Bodies at a
Joint Meeting.
The wine growers of this State are up
In arms against the proposed reciprocity
tariff measure fixing the duty on still
wines Imported from France at 35 cents
a gallon. A meeting was held yesterday
morning at the offices of Henry J. Crock
er, president of the Winemakers' Cor
poration, and there were present among
others George Frank West, P. Rossi,
Charles Bundschu, C. Schilling and Win
neld Scott, representing the winegrowers
and merchants. The meeting was pre-
Bided over by A. Sbarboro. After
pome vigorous speeches against the pro
posed measure, which was characterized
as iniquitous and inimical to the best in
terests of the wine industry of the Paci
fic Coast, the following telegram was or
dered sent to Senator George C. Perkins:
California Wine Makers' Corporation.
SAN FRANCISCO, June 2, 1898.
Hon. George C Perkins. United States Sen
ate, Washington, D. C. : Meeting wine dealers
;Â«jid producers held to-day. Fending further
consideration as to other points, It Is our belief
Government will recognize that error has been
commuted in not construing section 3 of tarllr
act. in connection with article 296, schedule H,
BO as to limit 35-cent rate to still wines con
taining 14 per cent or less of alcohol. You will
remember that in 1594 representatives, import
. -â . and native producers submitted to Treasury
Department proofs that if any goods contain
ing looho] were admitted at less duty than
internal revenue tax the door would be open
to importation of artificial compounds of cheap
potato and beet root spirits to imitate wines
fur use of rectifiers of spirits, thereby defraud
ing and reducing our internal revenue. Deputy
Commissioner Wilson is familiar with this
question and can explain necessity of having
limitation Included In President's proclamation.
Please submit this to Senator White and Cali
fornia Representatives and ask for united ac
tion. HENRY .1. CROCKER,
President California Wine Makers' Corporation.
CHARLES A. WETMORE,
,F. A. WEST,
Sweet Wine Association.
A committee consisting of 11. J. Crock
er, C. A. Wetmore and F. A. West was
appointed to attend the joint meeting of
the various commercial bodies of this
city held in the Mills building in the aft
ernoon, and request their co-operation In
the movement. At this meeting were
present representatives of the Chamber
of Commerce, Board of Trade and the
Merchants' Association.. After the com
mittee had stated Its case the following
resolutions were unanimously adopted:
â Whereas. The President has issued a procla
mation extending to France the benefits of the
reduced tariff rates, as provided for In sec
tion 3 of the present tariff law, in consideration
of certain concessions to American products,
and whereas, it appears that by some over
sight on the part of Congress the meaning and
intention of paid section 3 cannot be ; clearly
understood without construing It In harmony
with article 296 of schedule 11, which dis
tinguishes between natural and fortified wines;
and. whereas, it cannot - have been the inten
tion of either Congress or the President to ad
mit foreign alcoholic compounds'. at a less rate
of duty than the internal revenue tax on simi
lar compounds made In this country: and.
whereas. It appears that under the proposed
new arrangement with France compounds -of
cheap alcohol made to imitate wines with a
strength of 24 per cent of spirit, or nearly half
the strength of proof spirits, may be imported
at a duty of thirty-five cents per gallon and
be used by rectifiers to compound with spirits
taxed In, this country at $1 10 per proof gal
lon, thereby - reducing our public revenue : and
giving an advantage to foreign trade over do
mestic producers, besides demoralizing the pure
wine- Industry.. - â  " .â 
R. -solved. That the attention of our Senators
and Representatives â  In Congress .be called to
this danger menacing our public revenues and
threatening our local Industries, and that they
he requested to urge the President to so modify
his arrangement with Franco .by amendment
thereof, -or Iby â  regulations and ! Instructions to
Collectors of Customs, so that the reduced rate
of thirty-five cents on . still wines shall '' apply
only to wines containing 14 per cent or less of
alcohol, and that the principle shall be recog
nized that.no foreign goods containing alcohol
shall pay a less rate of duty than the tax im
posed by the internal revenue laws on domes
tic spirits and compounds thereof. - ...... i
. Resolved, That in any arrangement . with
France for reciprocal purposes, the benefits : of
the same should .he limited to the genuine
products of France, and should not be extended
to German. Spanish and other foreign goods
Imported through French ports where they are
suffered to be treated in , imitation of genuine
French products. . - , / '
Resolved. That . these resolutions be tele
graphed at once to â  our Senators and Repre
sentatives in Congress with request for imme
diate action.

An Enjoyable and Pleasant Evening

"Well, great Scott I

"Wheels, wheels, X V Z!

When a few hundred lusty-lunged

likelihood that people In the immediate
neighborhood will hear them, and that
the cries were heard was evidenced by
the large crowd that gathered In the
Vicinity of the Bay City Wheelmen's
Club rooms on Golden Gate avenue last
evening.
Thf; heroes of century runs and many
spills held a smoker last night and in
vited thereto about twenty-five of the
visiting volunteers who are members of
the Denver Cycling Club. The visitors
have enjoyed the hospitality of the Red
cross and received a cordial greeting
along the line of march, but both pale
Into Insignificance to the rousing recep
tion the knights of the silent steed re
ceived at the hands of the Bay City boys.
Red and blue lights were burned outside
in honor of the guests and the jink.s
room was splendidly decorated with flags
and bunting. Suspended from the wall
were knapsacks and other military trap
pings, giving the room a martial appear
ance.
Everything was done to give the Col
oradoans an enjoyable evening. Refresh
ments, cigars, cigarettes and pipes were
passed around, and as they smoked and
drank they listened to sweet singing,
cleverly told yarns and instrumental
music which made them for the time for

be the loved ones at home.
Judge Dunne, an old and honored mem

welcome in which he voiced the senti

greeted with enthusiasm and the follow

COLONEL GUTHRIE'S BLUNDER.
He Ignored His Superior Officers in
the National Guard and Will
Be Disciplined.
Should the Second Regiment of the Na
tional Guard of California, composed of
men in the Sacramento Valley, fail to
be mustered into the United States serv
ice under the second call for troops, the
failure may he charged to Colonel
Guthrie. The story poos that Colonel
Outline, Ignoring his superior officer, the
Governor, who is commander-in-chief of
the State forces, tendered his regiment to
the President through I'nited States Sen
ator Perkins. The unusual and unmiM
tary request was at once transmitted to
the Governor and Colonel Guthrie will
certainly he called to account.
The companies of the Second Regiment
ought not to be punished, because the
colonel made a blunder. When the Gov
ernor and adjutant general consider all
the points involved it may be deemed ad
visable to create a new regiment from or
ganizations of the Second and Fifth Regi
ments of the National Guard.

THE FALL OF
OFFICER FELL
One of the Pets of the
Chief in Trouble.
SENT TO THE GUARD HOUSE
AN OUNCE OF OEANGE MAKES
TONS OF TBOUBLE.
A Pathetic Tale of the Horrors of
War and the Troubles of
a Very Zealous
Policeman.
As the days roll by and the muster roll
of the boys In blue increases the face
of^ Police Officer Fell grows longer and
troubled sighs shake the frame of the
pet of one Lees, who would rejoice In
the title of a latter-day Sherlock Holmes.
This particular pet of his chieftainship,
like all other pets, wishes to ape the ac
tions of his lord and master, and his un
bounded zeal is daily leading him into
paths more and more stony. In fact the
rocky road to Dublin bears no compari
son to the crooked and stony pathway
over which the feet of Fell are wearily
stumbling.
The story of the first fall of Fell has
already been told in these columns, but
it Is so luscious that perhaps it will bear
repetition. On that occasion the foxy
ears of the pet detected an unwonted
noise; he was on the alert at onceâ neck
stretched out, eyes alert and nerves
tense. Like a true disciple of Lees and
Holmes he followed the sound as does
hound anlseseed. Suddenly, with a cry of
joy at which the earth trembled, he
swooped upon four small offenders. The
boys had heard the music of clanging
sabers and the muffled tread of marching
feet and, as is natural, gave vent to their
feelings In a storm of cheers. But this
mighty minion of the law felt no pa
triotism and gathered them in for dis
turbing the peace. He was censured for
bis conduct by a police judge.
Now comes the second chapter in the
tale of the "Cop of the sorrowful coun
tenance": Yesterday afternoon an itiner
ant vender of oranges, who hails from
the shores of Naples, wended his way to
ward the tented fields overlooking the
broad vista of the Pacific on one side and
a panorama of burial grounds on the
other. He was accompanied by an ani
mated hat rack, a collection of odds and
ends termed, for the sake of description,
a wagon, and several boxes of golden Cal
ifornia oranges. As he neared the camp
he halted for a moment to allow the
foundered hat-rack to breathe. As he did
so a boy in blue took up his position just
opposite. The soldier looked at the
orangesâ they were luscious, tempting.
He took an inventory of the contents of
his pocket and found therein a suede
glove, a ribbon and three hair pins. The
breeze brought the refreshing odor of
oranges to his nostrils. His mouth
watered and his jaws ached. At double
quick he charged on the wagon and ap
propriated the largest orange he could lay
his hands on. There was a muttered
"Caramba," and numerous other things,
as the son of Sunny Italy pounced on the
guardian of Uncle Sam's honor. The
event was witnessed from the camp and
the wagon was surrounded, captured and
emptied in about three seconds.
As soon as the fracas was safely over
and danger past the pet of the chief
strolled leisurely along with his knuckles
in his eyes. The son of Italy, seeing a
policeman, remembered the old adage and
told his troublesâ told them in a way that
made the blood of the disciple of Lees j
and other great men boil and he resolved
a mightly resolve. He would charge the
camp of the enemy alone. Here was an
open gateway to fame and laurels such as
even the mighty chief of the San Fran
cisco police force had never dreamed of
winningâ but ho reckoned without hia
host.
The ornament of doorposts approached
the lines and selected a youth frail and
fair of countenance as the victim of his
Indignation, and, waiving the formalities
of a permit, entered the camp. The boys
saw what was coming and simply looked
wise until he was fairly within the lines.
He started in pursuit of the soldier, who
ran a few steps and made a sign, which (
might have been a salute but which per
haps was not, and then unceremoniously
ducked into a tent. The man who is su
preme among civilians attempted to en
ter, but found his way barred by four
shining bayonets. At the same moment I
the heavy hand of a major was laid on !
his shoulder, and the cry of "Guard fall
in" grated unpleasantly upon his ears.
When informed that' lie was under arrest
for entering the camp without a permit
great beads of perspiration stood on his
brow and his helmet raised two inches.
He tried to argue the question, but it was
as futile as the efforts of a man to con
vince a policeman that he isn't drunk
when that worthy opines that he Is.
Officer Fell was given a half-hour in the
guardhouse to commune with his Inner
consciousness upon the futility of at
tempting to get the best of I'ncle Sam's ;
boys. Many of them afterward expressed '
keen disappointment that they were not |
given an opportunity to cradle him in a
blanket and play balloon ascension.
SOLDIERS ENTERTAINED.
Reception and Banquet Given by the
Junior Order United American
Mechanics.
The reception and banquet given by the
subordinate councils of the Junior. Order
United American Mechanics and the
Daughters of Liberty to the members of
the order belonging to the volunteer
troops now here and the Grand Army and
Woman's Relief Corps filled B'nai B'rith
Hall last evening as it never was before.'
Several hundred of the boys in blue at
Camp Merritt obtained leave to attend
the reception, while a large number of
Grand Army men and their ladies were
present. In addition the local members
and those from Alameda County helped
to fill the hall to overflowing.
The arrangements were in charge of
State Vice-Councilor F. A. Tibbits and a
committee consisting of the councilor of
each subordinate council. The guests
were first entertained with the following
programme: Overture, orchestra; selec
tions, Columbia Zither Club;, song. Baby
Mearns; "Our Order," Charles Rogers;
cornet solo, C. J. Lesher; recitation, Z. T
"VVhitten; reading, L. J. Theisen.
Then while the floor was being cleared
for dancing the guests were escorted to
the banquet hall in the basement, where
covers had been laid for 500. It was nec
essary, however, to servo the banqueters
In installments, the crowd being so great
that the tables were filled three timt's
The Daughters of Liberty, who assumed
charge of the commissary department,
provided more than enough for all. The
room and tables wore beautifully deco
rated, which added to the relish of the
viands.
Dancing was continued until long after
the cars Stopped, hut the soldier boys
preferrfil thÂ« long walk to camp rather
than desertion of the pretty girls. Alto
gether it was the most successful social
atYatr in the history of the order in th'Â«
city.

SKIPPED WITH
THE MONEY
Number of Railroad Em
ployes Are Swindled
BY A DISHONEST CATERER
HE COLLECTS IN ADVANCE FOR
MEALS AND VANISHES.
An Episode in the Restaurant in
the Old Red Building at
Fourth and Townsend
Streets.
The caterer. Miller by name. In the old
railroad building restaurant at the corner
of Fourth and Townsend streets, has le
vanted, and with him went considerable
money to which he had no legal rig-ht.
When the system of feeding the railroad
employes was inaugurated in the old
red building some years ago several hun
drexl men were feu daily, and the restau
rant was a great success. The railroad
rented the privilege to outside parties,
with the proviso that the boys were to be
charged 15 cents a day, or $4 50 a month.
Before the removal of the offices uptown
most of the clerks availed themselves of
the convenience and the man who rented
the privilege made a good thing out of
nis speculation. But when the number
of employes dwindled down to three hun
dred, and these mostly in the freight of
fices, the proposition was not so good
The novelty of the affair had worn off,
and most of the employes went to what
ever eating house their own sweet will
dictated, and lately the caterer has been
feeding probably less than one hundred
men.
The pay car for the railroad employer
arrived yesterday and the boys were
paid off. The $4 50 for the meal's during
the month of June had to be paid in ad
vance. Miller collected the money and
skipped for unknown lands, for when the
hungry tribe went up to the top story to
have their empty stomachs filled at noon
yesterday there was nothing to fill them
with. After a little Investigation it de
veloped that Miller had disappeared, and
with him the money which was to have
paid for lunches the rest of the month
It is said that Miller has had consider
able trouble in dodging his creditors
lately and hardly a day passed but some
bill was presented for payment. So be
sides the money appropriated from the
employes of the railroad company he left
owing several hundred dollars to others
No trace of the fugitive had been dis
covered up to a late hour last night, and
inquiry in many localities failed to de
velop his whereabouts, although it is al
most certain that he has left the city
with his ill-gotten booty.

WORK OF CLEVER SWINDLERS.
Sold Tickets for a Charity Entertain
ment Which Never Took Place.
There are some natures which seem to i
find nothing too low for them to stoop j
to and will stop, at nothing to turn. a.
dishonest dollar, even to playing on the
sympathies of the charitable. A number
of men of this class made a good haul !
during the past week. They visited many
homes and disposed of tickets for an en
tertainment for the benefit of the Boys'
Training Home at 26 Laurel place. The â 
entertainment was to have taken place
last night in the Maple room of the Pal
ace and tickets were disposed of at $1 '
each. When the hour set for the enter- I
tainment came a number of people vis
ited the hotel, only to find they had been
cleverly duped.
The matter was brought to the atten
tion of A. H. Hutchinson, superintendent
of the school, by a number of those who
had been swindled, but he knew nothing
about it. In fact. It was first brought to
his attention when he was asked for an f
explanation. During the night he was
repeatedly called- up by people from all
parts of â¢ the . city, and it appears as I
