GENERAL GARCIA'S CAMP, ASER
RADERO, Cuba, June 20 (via Port An
tonio, Jamaica, June 21).â The first land
ing of regular troops has just taken
place at this little point of land twelve
miles west of Santiago. It was a landing
for a conference only, and the most in
teresting feature of it is that without a
military escort of any sort General
Shafter, commander of the army of in
vasion, and his staff; Admiral Sampson
and Lieutenant Stanton, his chief of
staff, have landed in a small boat on
shore in the enemy's country, within
twelve miles of 12,000 Spanish soldiers
and Castle Morro, without a musket or
a revolver to protect them.
The Marblehead lay off the shore. A
ragged escort of I Ã¼ban soldiers met
them on landing, but of United States
Boldiers, except in the sense that offi
cers of the highest rank in the army
are soldiers, there was not one.
It is a historical moment in the his
tory of Cuba, if not of America, for
General Garcia, General Shatter and
Admiral Sampson have met for the
first time. They are grouped together
under a sun so hot that it burns eyes
on the high cliff overlooking the mag
nificent valley of royal palms which
meets the motionless blue sea, broken
only by lines of white breakers on
shore, and further out is broken again
by the slow moving hulls of thirty
transports and thirty ships of war.
The three commanders are seated on
k boxes under the palm leaf roof of an
open hut. One of them has a blue print
map on his knees, and before they roll
it up again the attack on Santiago will
be decided upon and her fate sealed.
Outside this hut are five negro sen
tries, naked to the waist, and in the
open space about the hut are hundreds
of Cuban army officers, well armed,
well uniformedâ privates of every shade
of skin, with every make of weapon,
and Bmall laughing boys armed with
machetes or not armed at all.
The palmleaf hut where the confer
ence is taking place is open to the hot
air at both ends, and on each side and
standing about it or kn-Hing on the
ground in order to obtain a better view
is the strangest gathering of persons
this war has thrown together.
Colonel John Jacob Astor is crowded
by a blnck giant with < nly a guard
belt to cover his naked shoulders.
There is also General Ludlow of the
engineers, General Costello and Lieu
tenant Miley and Admiral Sampson.
Colonel Ooetzen. the German attache,
in spotless white, and a Cuban officer
in a linen blouse and with bare feet
are talking in signs, and with them is
Captain Lee, the British attache,
booted and spurred, with fleldglasses,
hemlet and Immaculate kharki.
Captain Stewart Brice in the uniform
of the volunteer army, in blue Jacket,
with breeches rolled above the knee,
and a group of ensigns from the war
ehips, act as a background to the prin
cipal actors, and still further back of
them are Cuban soldiers squatting on
the ground, curious and interested, and
showing their teeth in broad smiles of
welcome and touching their straw hats
when any one of the American officers
looks their way.
Any land would seem fair after a
wtek on the troopships, but there are
The San Francisco Call
few lands that are more fair than this
one and few places on it that are more
beautiful than this camp of Garcia's,
lying between great mountains and a
great sea, shaded by royal palms and
colored by brilliant scarlet flowers.
The conference is ended and General
Shafter and the admiral are bidding
good-by to General Garcia, who looks,
with his beard and mustache of the
third empire, like a marshal of France.
What the conference has decided we
shall know to-morrow. For the present
the news is that the army of invasion
arrived. Its final landing has taken
place.
PLANS FOR THE ATTACK
BY SHAFTER'S INVADERS
No Time Will Be Lost Once the
Americans Have Landed
in Cuba.
NEW YORK, June 21.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
With effective co-operation of Ameri
can warships and insurgents assured,
naval officials say the debarkation of
troops ought not to be attended by any
great danger. Rear Admiral Sampson
has advised the Navy Department of
his conference with the insurgent lead
ers several days ago, and the authori
ties express satisfaction with the plan
as it has been communicated them.
The "plan contemplates the taking of
advanced positions' by the insurgent
forces under the fire of American men
of-war, and, when this feature of the
programme has been carried out,
troops will be landed. The authorities
feel confident the insurgents will be
able to hold out until reinforcements
can be sent to them, and by this means
the Spaniards will be unable to pre
vent the debarkation of the entire
army with quantities of supplies which
accompany it.
No official announcement will be
made as to the place of landing for the
reason that the authorities do not pro
pose to make public to the enemy a
plan which they would be thus in a
position to anticipate. One of the offi
cials with whom I talked said it was
near enough for the Herald to state
that the main body would be landed
within eight miles of the city, and no
time would be lost in making the at
tack.
The debarkation of the army will be
the beginning of an arduous cam
paign. The officials are beginning to
feel some apprehension that it will not
be the simple task which they have an
ticipated. It is known that Lieutenant
General Linares has been strongly re
inforced, to what extent has not been
reported to the Navy Department, but
the amount of credence placed in the
report is shown by the action of the
War Department in sending 8000 in
stead of 4000 men to reinforce General
Shatter's army, bringing his total force
up to 23,000 men.
It is believed Generals Garcia and
Rabi will be able to place 5000 or 6000

MADRID, June 21. â Very many rumors are current in diplomatic circles. The one
most generally accepted is also most apparently extravagant, yet it has such credence here
that I forward it to you. I may say it was a member of the German Embassy in Madrid who
was my informant and who gave me the news as being absolutely certain. I send it with
most express reserve, as it appears to me to belong entirely to the region of fancy.
According to my informant negotiations have been commenced between Spain, Ger
many and France. By an agreement with France and Spain Germany would acquire sole
proprietorship of the Philippine Islands, in exchange for which she would return AJsace and
Lorraine to France. Germany and France would intervene to restore peace between Spain
and the United States and France would agree to pay the amount of the American war
indemnity in addition to the actual expenses of the war itself.
This combination is too brilliant to. be strictly exact, although I am informed it is be
ing seriously examined by- the three interested powers. This much is certain: Senor Sa
gasta had an interview with a special envoy from the German Emperor, who was charged
with the duty of making the following proposition to the Spanish Government in behalf of
his imperial Majesty: k
Germany would establish a protectorate over the Philippines for twenty years, thus
taking the place of Spain in the archipelago. She would re-establish order after having sent
troops in sufficient numbers to bring the state of war in the islands to an end. As a return
for this temporary protectorate Germany would agree to pay into the Spanish treasury the
sum of 500,000,000 marks in gold to continue the war in Cuba.
Senor Sagasta has not yet given his reply to the German Emperor's envoy, but I have
received information from an authentic quarter that his reply will be in the negative.
men at the disposal of Shafter in addi
tion to 1000 Cubans who are serving
with the marines in Guantanamo and
performing bushwhacking work.
Rear Admiral Sampson has made
several highly complimentary reports
to the Navy Department on the
bravery of the Cubans and their gal
lantry is perhaps best shown by the
fact that thirty of their wounded are
now undergoing treatment on board
the Solace.
It will be necessary for General Shaf
ter to use Cuban skirmishers, leaving
the Americans to do the heavy fight
ing. The Cubans will be assisted by
Roosevelt's Rough Riders, who are
with the army.
The path which the army will take in
its march into Santiago has been prac
tically determined upon after careful
consideration by the Cubans and Rear
Admiral Sampson, and naval officers
familiar with it say it is the best that
gan be obtained, considering the coun
try over which the army will have to
move.
Admiral Sampson has officially In
formed the department that, notwith
standing the sinking of the Merrimac,
it is still possible for armorclads to go
either in or out of the harbor, provided
the mines in the channels and the bat
teries will permit. It is evident from
this that had Admiral Cervera wished
to do so he could have steamed out of
the harbor and attacked the American
armorclads, but instead he preferred to
remain safely anchored therein.

On Board Herald-Call Dispatch Boat,
off Santiago, June 20 (via Port Antonio,
Jamaica, June 22).â Two armies consist
ing of about 20,000 men are now ready
to co-operate with Admiral Sampson in
capturing Santiago. Coincidental with the
arrival of the American army of invasion
under command of Major General William
R. Shafter 4000 experienced Cuban
soldiers, comprising the command of Gen
eral Garcia, have appeared near Aser
radero and are in close communication
with the American fleet and troops.
Forty-seven United States vessels
bearing the first division of the Ameri
can army hove to at a point twenty
| miles southeast of Santiago at daybreak
this morning. There were fifteen war
ships and thirty-two troopships in the
fleet. Admiral Sampson was advised of
the approach of the troopships by the
Rogers and Ericcson and he promptly
sent Captain Chadwick of the flagship
New York to receive General Shafter.
Captain Chadwick went on the Glou
cester and acquainted General Shafter
with the location of the several points
at which troops might be landed.

to remain out of sight of land until the
point at which the troops are to dis
embark is selected. General Phafter
accepted this suggestion and all day
the troop fleet remained twenty miles
out at sea. It Is likely their presence
is known to the Spaniards, however, as
smoke from the transports must be
visible from Morro heights, which rise
250 feet above the sea.
The transports came through the
Windward Passage instead of using the
Yucatan Channel, as Admiral Sampson
expected them to do. The enthusiasm
of Admiral Sampson's men at the ar
rival of the troops was heightened by2
the news that General Garcia's army
of 4000 veterans was in the vicinity of
Aserradero, fifteen miles west of San
tiago, where is the headquarters of
Colonel Cebreco, the local Cuban chief,
whose following consists of 1000 men.
Garcia's army is equipped with thirteen
field guns.
News of the approach of the Cubans
was brought to Admiral Sampson and
General Rhafter to-day by General
Garcia, who came accompanied by
eight Cuban major-generals to present
his greetings and compliments to the
Americana, The visitin- officers were
taken on board by the flagship dispatch
boat, returning on the Vixen, which
makes regular trips to the point at
which the Cuban headquarters is ln
cated. General Garcia told the Ameri
can chiefs the concentration of Ameri
can warships and troops in the vicinity
of Santiago was certain to have a good
effect on Cuban troops all through the
eastern part of Cuba. There had been
a marked improvement, he said, in the
discipline of his soldiers since the arri
val of Admiral Sampson's fleet, and the
additional encouragement which the ar
rival of General Shafter's army would
bring could but result. General Garcia
Bald, in still further increasing the
fighting capabiltles of his men.
Admiral Sampson and the officers of
thp fleet at first were skeptical as to
the assistance the Cuban troops could
be depended upon to give. After con
sidering the personal information ob
tained from General Garcia, however,
they now expect ereat aid from Gar
cia's veteran warriors.
General Garcia also brought the
cheering news th~t his men were com
pletely equipped for effective warfare,
and that the arms and ammunition
sent by the Florida had been received
all right.
There is a difference of opinion
among the Cuban leaders as to the
most available landing place for the
American troops. One suggestion from
them is that the landing be made upon
the Carnegie Iron Company's dock at
Aquadores, after the fleet has driven
the Spaniards from the hills in that
vicinity. But shelling the mountains
Is unsatisfactory work, and I am told
that this suggestion will not be con
sidered seriously until other more
promising plans have been investi
gated. It may be decided to land
scouting parties at this point. General
Garcia, impressed by the advantages
already gained by the Americans
about Guantanamo Bay, advocates the
landing of General Shafter's army
there. If that plan should be adopted
the American troops, after taking
Guantanamo, could march against
Santiago from the east, while Garcia
and his men attack It from the west.
There is some objection to this plan by
the American officers, as it would mean
the loss of two weeks' time and subject
the American troops to a hard march
over mountain roads, during which
they would be exposed constantly to
bushwhacking attacks by the Span
iards before they could get to Santiago.
Colonel Cebreco urges the selection of
Acerraderos as a better place at
which to land troops than either of the
others. It is a hard and dangerous
march from that point to the plateau
opposite Santiago, hut the invading
army would be in a commanding posi
tion at the end of the march.
General Garcia's old failingâ seasick
nessâdisabled him from going into the
matter extensively while he was with
Admiral Sampson. It was decided to
have a conference at the Cuban head
quarters in Acerraderos
It is considered most likely, as Indi
cated in my former dispatches, that
the American troops will disembark at
the base of the high mountain range
to the westward of Santiago. Covering
the landing place are two low hills, of
which the Americans easily could take
possession. This done, field artillery
can be moved to tops of hills and from
there the Spaniards can be driven Into
retreat toward Santiago. It will be
possible also to destroy the remaining
defenses of the harbor, after which the
mines now protecting Cervera's fleet
can be removed. When everything
else is ready the wreck of the Merrimac
can be destroyed, the channel to the
inner harbor opened and Admiral
Sampson can drive Cervera's ships to
the northern side of the bay and there
capture or destroy them. When the
Spanish fleet is disposed of General
Shafter can readily surround and take
the city.
Information received from the shore
yesterday shows the Spanish are get
ting into most desperate Btralts daily.
Food is now getting so scarce that 600
Spanish cavalrymen have been dis
mounted In order that their horses may
be used for food.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, June 21.â Interest In
i the discussion of Hawaiian annexation,
i which is proceeding in the Senate, al
i ready has begun to flag. It is evident
i from the proceedings to-day that the
Senators will not become enthusiastic
over arguments which are not new to
them. Early to-day White (D.) of Cali
fornia, the leader of the opponents of
annexation, spoke for three hours and
a half. His argument was skillful and
presented with oratorical ability, but
it failed to command the attention from
Senators it really deserved. White had
| not concluded his argument when the
j resolutions were laid aside for the day.
! Mitchell (D.) of Wisconsin opened the
j discussion with a brief speech in oppo
i sition to the resolutions.
Among the bills passed was one pro
viding severe penalties for the mali
cious injury or destruction of subma
rine mines, torpedoes, fortifications or
other coast defenses.
Almost immediately after the Senate
convened the resolution for the annexa
tion of Hawaii was laid before It. Pend
ing its consideration Roacn of North Da
kota, who had been quoted ;n a Wash
irgton paper as favorable to annexation,
aros<j to a question of personal privi
lege He said he had not male tue state
ment attributed to him, and, a3 a matter
of fact, he was opposed and always had
been opposed to annexation of Hawaii.
Mitchell of "Wisconsin, in his speech in
opposition to annexation, declared the
nation Just now was shorn of its judg
ment. The effort to establish our Gov
ernment in the Far East and the adop
tion of a policy of imperialism was evi
dence of that. He thought the seizure
of Hawaii would remove all doubt as to
our land-grabbing intentions. He de
clared that the annexation project was
a clumsy cover for the sugar magnates,
from around the edge of which the sac
charine Juice dripped to the advantage
of all who cared to avail themselves
of it.
At the conclusion of Mitchell's speech
White of California, the leader of the
opponents of annexation, took the floor.
White maintained that the question
pending was not only of vital impor
tance, but the issues presented with it
deserved and ought to have the careful
consideration of all. He declared that
territory had been acquired by treaty,
but in no case had territory been ac
quired by such a "monstrous piece of
folly and contradiction" as was the pend
ing resolution. The resolution, he said,
declared that there had been a cession
which Congress was to "accept, ratify
and confirm." He demanded to know
what cession had been made, and what
lawyer in the Senate would state that
there had been a cession. He main
tained that there had been no cession
as there could not have been without the
concurrence of both parties.
"I would be ashamed of this Senate "
declared White, "if it should pass the
pending resolution, containing such a con
tradiction of names. I should be ashamed
of the Senate if it should adopt a declara
tion of a cession that had never existed
as a fact."
Referring to the possibility of annexa
tion of the Hawaiian Islands by legisla
tive action. White contended that the ex
ecutive would be justified in taking pos
session of foreign territory only as an act
of war, and only from the enemy. White
gave some attention to the possibility of
the Hawaiian Islands becoming a State
of the Union in case of annexation, ana
congratulated the country upon the fact
that no one bad been fovuid to contend
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALX., WEDNESDAY, JUNE 22, 1398.
for this right.- He characterized the con
ditions on the islands as a heterogeneou*
compound of manifest inefficiency- He
I contended that there were other ques
| tions than the annexation of Hawaii in
j volved in the present discussion. He re
i ferred to the assertion that the American
| Hag, once unfurled in a country, could
j not be taken down, and recommended
that whether this was true must depend
upon the circumstances under which it
was raised. It must depend upon whether
it is justly or unjustly raised. If planted
as a result of uncalled for invasion, and
in a spirit of conquest and of rapine and
murder, it could be maintained, but if
planted on foreign soil under proper and
patriotic circumstances, it must be main
! tamed there, if to do so should cost the
j country its greatest strength, its most
! powerful effort and the best blood of the
I nation.
White read among other things an
elucidation of the Monroe doctrine, and
then said:
"In this mad race for power, in this mad
j race for conquest of territory, let us con
j sider most carefully the doctrine of Mon
roe. It is idle for Senators to say we
must extend our domination over the
world. In enunciating the Monroe doc
; trine we announced that we desired no
Interference of European powers with
affairs in this hemisphere, but by those
who framed that doctrine it was in con
templation that we ourselves had no In
tention to Interfere with the territorial
possessions outside of this hemisphere.
"The acquisition of the Hawaiian Ibl
ands would be the entering wedge of
that imperialistic policy, which is as for
eign to the purposes in View when this
Government was organized as were the
purposes of the most despotic Govern
ment on earth to our system."
White had read by the clerk a protest
of the Japanese Minister to this country
against the arguments and conclusions
of the Foreign Relations Committee us
presented in its report on the Hawaiian
treaty. The particular object of the Min
ister's criticism was the statement of the
committee concerning the purpose of the
Japanese Government to interfere in Ha
waiian affairs.
As the clerk was about completing the
| reading of the document Mr. Morgan
arose and indignantly commented upon
such criticism of the Senate committee.
He declared no foreign Minister had any
right to send to the Senate such an at
tack upon Senators.
Mr. White said the Minister had not
sent the document to the Sei.'ate. He
had brought it himself.
"Is it an official paper?" inquired Mr.
Morgan.
Mr. White declined to say whether or
not it was official.
"If it is an official document filed by the
Japanese Minister to this country," de
clared Mr. Morgan, "it is a very outrage
ous assault upon the privileges of the Sen
ate."
Mr. White said there was nothing mys
terious about the paper and it did not in
fringe upon the rights of the Senate.
"I am calling the report of the commit
tee into question; I am criticizing it, as
I have a right to do so. If it is not a copy
of an authentic document the argumen 1 . â¢Â»*
good, and I adopt it."
"I do not object," said Mr. Morgan, "to
the Senator making use of any material
he desires. I do object to what I consid
er the error of the Department of State
in receiving such a document as that if
It be an official paper."
"I do not say the document was cer
tified to by the Japanese Minister," said
Mr. White, "but I have understood that
it was filed." â 
"With the Secretary of State?" in
quired Mr. Morgan.
"I have said all I care to say about it,"
replied Mr. White.
"Well, what I complain of." continued
Mr. Morgan, "is that the Secretary of
State should permit to be filed In his of
fice a paper imputing to a committee of
this body ignorance, at least, and per
haps worse â prevarication. I regret we
have come upon a time when other de
partments of the Government will permit
such criticisms, which are incisive, if not
dangerous, upon the Senate of the United
States."
At 4:30 p. m. the Hawaiian resolution
was laid aside.

OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA. Mon
day, June 20, 1 p. m. (via Mole St.
Nicholas, Hayti, June 21, 3 a. m.)â The
United States army for the invasion of
Cuba, about 16,000 strong, commanded
by General Shafter, arrived off San
tiago de Cuba at noon to-day. The
time of its disembarkation has not yet
been determined upon, but it will be
within the next three days.
When the fleet of thirty-five trans
ports with its freight of fighting men
swept up the southern coast to-day and
slowed up within sight or the doomed
city of Santiago, the anxiously awaited
soldiers were greeted with ringing
cheers, which faintly echoed to the
transports from the decks of the block
ading- warships far inshore. They were
answered by the troops most enthu-'
siastically and in kind. The weeks of
anxious waiting and of impatient chaf
ing were over, the army and the navy
had at last joined forces, and all felt
that the final blow at Santiago was at
hand.
It was 1 o'clock this morning when
the lookout on the Brooklyn reported
seeing the smoke of several steamers
away to the southeast, and a moment
or two later he announced that a dozen
or two transports were in sight. The
news was exchanged from ship to ship,
gladdening the hearts of the weary
blockaders. Then the auxiliary cruiser
Gloucester, formerly J. P. Morgan's
yacht Corsica, darted away to meet and
to welcome the troops.
About half an hour later a grim forest
of masts had sprung up apparently
from the sea, and a most impressive
scene was presented as the armada
swept gracefully up from the horizon
toward the shores where the great
struggle is to take place. The trans
ports were ranged in three shifting
lines, with the battleship Indiana on
the extreme right and the other men
of-war on the outskirts of the fleet. In
this order the transports and their
escorts steamed slowly in toward the
hil!s where Morro's red walls gleamed
in the sunlight.
It was intended to take the entif*
fleet to the line of Rear Admiral Samp
son's squadron of warships, but an or
der from the admiral stopped the ad
vancp of the ships about fifteen miles to
the southeast and, escorted by the
Gloucester, General Shafter went for
ward on the Seguranca to confer with
the admiral.
Tho transports lay on the smooth sea
while plans were discussed by the lead
ers on board the flagship. Not the
faintest intimation of their intentions
regarding the landing has been allowed
to escape. Undoubtedly, however, some
of the troops will be landed at Guan
tanamo Bay in order to relieve the ma
rines there, but it is generally believed
the main body of the troops will be
landed much nearer Santiago.
The long and trying journey from
Tampa has left the men in much better
condition than anticipated. There are
fourteen mild cases of typhoid on the
ships, among the patients being Major
Horton of the Twenty-fifth Infantry,
and several cases of measles. There
are. however, no serious cases of sick
ness.
Owing to the smoothness of the pas
sage the soldiers were not generally af
fected by seasickness. They are all
wildly anxious to get ashore and begin
fighting:.
The dispatch boat of the Associated
Press, as she steamed among the trans
ports, was eagerly besieged on all sides
for news of Admiral Sampson's opera
tions, officers and men clamoring for a
word from the blockading fleet. Much
satisfaction was expressed among the
troops when it became known that the
actual rapture of Santiago is to be left
to the army.
The horses and mules on board the
transports have suffered severely,
many dying.
The American fleet off Santiago has
been greatly strengthened by the addi
tion of the warships which escorted the
transports, consisting: of the Indiana,
Detroit. Montgomery, Bancroft, Hel
ena, Ericsson, Foote, Hornet, Annapo
lis, Castine and Eagle.
Wherever the landing may take place,
the operations and the Information of
the last ten days show conclusively that
bitter work is ahead for Shafter's men
before the Spanish flag comes down
from Morro's walls. The Spanish In
fantry, cavalry and guerrilla forces, es
timated by Admiral Sampson to-day to
number from 30,000 to 35,000 men, are
stretched from Guantanamo to Caban
as, a distance of fifty miles, and ready
to concentrate at the point of attack.
But, starving and harassed by the in
surgents, the situation of the Spaniards
is desperate, and naval officers famil
iar with the situation fully expect ter
rific fighting about Santiago.
Interviews with army officers on the
transports show that, there is some anx
iety as to how the men will stand the
strain if the fighting begins immediate
ly after the long inactivity at Tampa
and the wearing voyage. There is no
fear, however, for the final result, as
the guns of the fleet will be of Im
mense assistance to the American
troops.
Before nightfall all the transports
and th-j ecnvcyng warships had drift
ed nearer to the shore and the Spanish
soldiers, watching from the bluffs on
both sides of the entrance of Santiago
harbor must have been impressed by
the great array of vessels standing off
shore. There were nearly sixty of them,
Including the troop ships and the men
of-war, comprising Rear - Admiral
Sampson's fleet and the squadron\ of
Commodore Schley.
The 8000 Spanish soldiers and perhaps
2000 Spanish sailors guarding the city
and harbor of Santiago de Cuba doubt
less concluded that there was but a
small chance of overcoming the force
of American warships and some 20,000
American soldiers and sailors which
will be hurled against them before the
present week is over.
The dispatch boat of the Associated
Press left the fleet for the cable sta
tion just at nightfall, when the war
ships had taken their positions in a
semi-circle in front of the harbor en
trance with the troop ships further
out.
The sea was comparatively smooth, ,
for the first time in several weeks, and
the great fleet was almost motionless.
The soldiers, most of whom beheld the
shores of Cuba for the first time in
their lives, watched the steep mountain
sides through the gathering darkness.
The newspaper dispatch boats, which
had been steaming back and forth
among the transports since the arrival
of the latter, were held at every stage
of their passage with the request to
take letters to the nearest point an
nouncing the arrival of the army.
According to the naval regulations
established at the outbreak of the war
not a light was visible on any of the I
ships and the cordon of men-of-war
lying under the Spanish guns near
Morro Castle kept their vigil with more
than usual care during the dark hours
of the night to guard against the ap
proach of a destroying torpedo-boat
which might attempt to run out of the
harbor and with one well directed shot
sink a troopship in the depths of the sea
and send the souls of those aboard into
the realms of eternity.

FROM MORRO

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, June
21.â Assistant Naval Constructor
Hobson and his seven compan
ions who sunk the collier Merri
mac across the entrance to the
harbor were prisoners in Morro
Castle during the bombardment
by the American fleet on June 6.
None of them were injured. They
were locked in Morro after their
capture and were kept there
while lodgings for them were be
ing prepared in the barracks
which are in the city. These were
not ready for them until June 7,
when they were moved.
RAMSDEN, British Consul.
WASHINGTON, June 21.â The re
fusal of the Spaniards to exchange
Lieutenant Hobson and his comrades is
regarded by members of the Cabinet as
a trick to prevent the bombardment of
Morro Castle and as quite in line with
the vein of trickery in the Spanish ;
character. What further inducements
will be put forward to secure their re
lease, if any, is not known.
NO FURTHER PAROLES.
All Persons Captured on Spanish
Prize Ships to Be Held.
KEY WEST, June 21, 4:15 p. m.â
United States Marshal Horr received
instructions from Attorney-General
Griggs to-day to hold all persons cap
tured on Spanish prize ships until fur
ther orders.
The message created much surprise
among officials here, as all but military
prisoners had been recently paroled and i
were to have sailed for Spain this week.
The prisoners concerned have been
penned up on the priz^ ships in the har
bor ever since captured. There are
more than 200. The military prisoners
are at Fort McPherson, Atlanta.
SHOT IN THE BACK
BY A HIGHBINDER.
Chung Van, a Former Business As
sociate of Little Pete, the Lat
est Chinatown Victim.
Chung Van, an overall manufacturer of
310 Washington street, was shot and per
haps fatally wounded by an unknown
man at an early hour this morning.
The Injured man was walking down
Washington street toward Bartlett alley,
when a figure crept noiselessly up be
hind him, fired a shot into the back of
his head and uisappeared as completely
as though the earth had swallowed him.
Officers Peters and Furlong heard the '
shot and rushed to the scene to find the
Street deserted, save by the uncon
scious bleeding figure on the sidewalk.
They had the man removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where it was found !
that the skull was badly fractured, and
little hopes are entertained for his re- â 
covery.
.The police suspect a man who has been
in business with Chung Van of having !
committed the deed, and hope to land
him. Chung Van was at one time in
business with the famous Little Pete
and is well known in Chinatown.
The population of the United States has
Increased by 12,000,000 persons during the
last ten years.

MONTHS OF
THE WAR
Cause for Gratification Over
What Has Been Ac
complished.
Decisive Blows to Be Struck
Rapidly in Spain's West
Indian Territory.
"WASHINGTON, June 21. â Two
months ago to-day war broke out be
tween the United States and Spain,'ac
cording to the proclamation of the
I'r-sident and the declaration of Con
gress. The end of that period finds
! nearly 16,000 United States troops lying
ntiago preparing to land; it finds
cable communication established be
tween the Government at Washington
and the advance guard of the expedi
tion in Cuba, and it finds Cuban terri
tory in the possession of the United
Slates marines, backed by a squadron,
and nearly all of the commercial ports
of Cuba blockaded. This is all apart
from Dewey's gTeat victory at Manila,
and from the splendid results achieved
in organizing the armies now in camps.
The officers of the administration feel
that they have a right to look back
with pride over what has been accom
plished in the short space of two
months, working in a large part with
raw material in both t*he army and
the navy.
The vessels that have arrived off San
â  with the troops on board of them,
according to data supplied by the War
] department by General Shafter, num
ber, with the convoys, forty-nine, and
this is the largest fleet thai ever left the
waters of the United States for a for
eign port. It is expected that the trans
- will remain off Santiago, or per
haps nearer the exact landing point of
t liÂ»- troops, until Santiago has been cap
tured, when they will take aboard the
ter portion of the invading army, if
it can be spared from that locality, and
convey the troops to Porto Rico to ef
fect the capture of that island.
The Government has now determined
to send heavy re-enforcements to Gen
eral Shafter at Santiago. To this end
the first expedition will leave Newport
News on Thursday morning, carrying
Brigadier General Duffield's separate
brigade of the second army corps, made
tip of the Ninth Massachusetts, the
Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth Michi
gan and the Third Virginia regiments,
Jk-i all about 4000 men. The expeditions
vill follow rapidly by way of Tampa,
for while Fernandina ami Miami are
considered to have many good points
f<r concentrating troops, yet army of
ti< ials are now satisfied that Tampa
can be retained with advantage as the
main point of embarkation.
The next forces will include those of
Brigadier General Garretson of the
nd Brigade. First Division, Second
Army Corps, embracing the Sixth Illi
nois, the Sixth Massachusetts and the
Eighth . and Ninth Ohio regiments.
Brigadier General Guy V. Henry, a
distinguished cavalry officer of the reg
ular army, arrived here to-day from
T;>mpa and the present plans are for
ral Henry to command a division
made up of the brigades of General
Duffield and General Garretson, this
division comprising Wtoo men, for the
speedy re-enforcement of General Shaf
ter. It will at once swell the American
forces at Santiago de Cuba to about
0 men. But the expeditions will
not 'stop at that number, as there is* a
determined purpose to send forward a
sufficient force to crush any Spanish
command which may be concentrated
at that point.
The reports from Santiago that about
41,000 Spanish troops are in and about
the city do not agree with the reliable
estimates in the possession of the War
Department. According to the latter |
there are not to exceed 14.000 Spanish
troops at Santiago while 100 miles away I
to the northwest, at Holquin, the Span
ish corps commander. General Pando,
has 10.000 men. The War Department
Is satisfied that the Cuban forces under !
Garcia can keep Pando from re-en- j
forcing Santiago. Should this not be i
accomplished the Spanish forces at !
Santiago would be augmented to about !
25,000 men.
They are all well armed, well dis
ciplined, used to the climate, know the
fighting grounds of that locality and
.are as good an all-round fighting force i
8 the Spaniards can bring to bear, i
There is no purpose on the part of the

! day was confined to the one brief dis
patch from Capt&in Allen of the signal
service to General Greely stating that
the troop transports had arrived. The
landing itself may take considerably
; longer than was anticipated and offi
! cials believe that at least three days
j more will be required before the troops
! are on shore and in any sort of organ
i ized condition. General Miles said this
j morning:
"I anticipate it will take at least
forty-eight hours to disembark our
troops and establish a convenient base
! of supplies sufficiently strong to make
i the campaign in a strange country pos
j sible and safe. We are all compara
j tively ignorant of Admiral Sampson's
i plans. He will be governed by circum
! stances."
Captain James Allen of the staff of
Major General Miles, who was recently
stationed at Key West as censor, has
I been appointed to take charge of the
censorship at Guantanamo. The
Guantanamo cable is regarded as of the
! greatest importance to the Government.
and the cable station and telegraph
lino will be carefully- guarded.
The officials of the Navy Department
j were not deeply concerned over the re
port from Hongkong that the Chinese
authorities had ordered the United
States dispatch-boat Zaflro out of Chi
nese waters without allowing her to
take supplies to- Dewey. The reason for
this unconcern was the conviction that
the cruiser Charleston and the trans
ports have already reached Manila car
rying a quantity of just such supplies
as the American fleet there would most
require. Then, too, it was felt that the
Zafiro had already been treated with
consideration and probably obtained all
the privileges to which she was entitled
irr Chinese waters.
WHY SANTIAGO IS
TO BE CAPTURED.
Present Movement Only One of a
Series Against Cuba's Prin
cipal Ports.
WASHINGTON. June 21.â Now that
the army is about to set foot on Cuban
soil, the purpose of this move on San
ri. go was pointed out to-day by an
army official fully acquainted With the
general plan of action. He said Santia
go de Cuba was not to be made a mili
tary base of operations, as it was not
adapted for such use. Being far re
moved from the rich and populous
portion of the island, without railroad
or ordinary highways for transnorting
munitions of war westward the town
would be practically useless as a basis
of military supplies. For that reason,
he said, there had never been an idea
of occupying this place as the first
base and then gradually extending op
erations westward. On the contrary,
this occupation of Santiago was but an
incident of the general plan of occupy
ing several points, and in due time
there would be landings at the west
end of Cuba just as there had been at
the east end. Each point of landing
would serve for the time being as a
base for the surrounding country.
The occupation of Santiago, he point
ed out, would accomplish several inci
dental but very desirable ends. First
of these was the capture of Admiral
Cervera's fleet, which would always
remain a menace and an uncertain fac
tor until entirely disposed of. Another
point which had come un was the re
lief of Hobson and his brave band of
associates, and the raising of the Amer
ican- flag on Cuban soil, whether at the
east or the west end, would have a
powerful moral influence, alike stimu
lating.to our own people and our fight
ing forces and disheartening to Spain.
The humiliation to Spain was in hav
ing our men and our flag planted on
her soil, whether the particular point
was to be used as a base of operations
or not. It would also convey notice to
the world at large that the United
States was entrenched on the Island of
Cuba as well as fn the Philippines.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JDNE 22, 1898.
DROWNED AT
A LAUNCHING
Terrible Catastrophe in
? 2Â£if England.
MANY BODIES RECOVERED
TWO HUNDRED PERSONS ARE
THROWN INTO THE WATER.
Heartrending Scenes Enacted During
the Identification of the Dead
at the Blackwall
Shipyard.
LONDON. June 21.â During the
launching of the British first-class bat
tle-ship Albion of 12,950 tons at Black
wall to-day, conducted by the Duchess
of York with ceremonies, at which the
United States Embassador, Colonel
John Hay, and Mrs. Hay, and Lieuten
ant-Colonel Wells, the United States
naval attache, assisted, the displace
ment of the water caused an immense
mass of it to rise on all sides, .com
pletely submerging one of the lower
stages of the yard and immersing hun
dreds of people. It is believed that fifty
persons were drowned.
The Duchess of York and Colonel and
Mrs. Hay and the remainder of the dis
tinguished guests did not see the acci
dent, which occurred at the moment
when three cheers were called for the
successful launching, and the cries and
screams of the victims were drowned
by the outburst of hurrahs and steam
sirens.
The bodies of five men, eighteen wo
men and eleven children have been re
covered.
The Duke and Duchess of York have
telegraphed assurances of their pro
i found regret and sympathy.
Thousands who witnessed the launch
; ing, including the royal party, left the
i scene ignorant of the disaster. The
staging that was destroyed had been
i erected for workmen near the stern of
! a Japanese cruiser in the course of con
j struction in the Blackwall yards. It
| was a light structure about fifty feet
i long, and notices had been pasted
: warning the public that it was danger-
I ous.
Despite the efforts of the police some
200 people invaded the staging, which
commanded a good view of the launch
ing. Two great waves completely de
molished it and on receding carried
most of its occupants into deep water.
The water was alive with struggling
people and floating debris. It was a
scene of terrible confusion. The shrieks
of the unfortunate people mingled with
the cheers over the success of the
launching. Fortunately there was
plenty of help # near in the shape of po
lice boats and other craft.
The ship builders, with drags, and
the firemen who participated, were all
prompt in affording succor. Many were
revived by artificial respiration. Some
were injured by colliding with the de
bris.
Heartrending scenes have been wit
nessed throughout the evening as the
identification of the dead slowly pro
ceeded.
The Albion is a first-class battleship
of 12,950 tons, 30!) feet long, 74 feet
broad and drawing 25 feet 5 inches of
water. She is to have 13,">00 Indicated
horsepower, has two propellers, and
costs about $4,000,000.
The new battleship has eight inches
of Harveylzed steel on her side, six
inches on her bulkheads and from
twelve to five inches on her gun por
tions.' Her armored deck is from two
to three inches in thickness, her es
timated speed is nearly nineteen knots.
She is to carry 1850 tons of coal, her
crew is to number 700 men, and her
armament is to consist of four twelve
inch guns, twelve six-inch quick-fir
ing guns and eighteen smaller quick
firing guns, with five torpedo tubes.

I TO RAISE PEB CAPITA TAXES.
DENVER. June 21.â Important action
I was taken this afternoon by the council
I of the General Federation of Women's
Clubs on the increased taxation of clubs.
This advisory body will recommend to the
federation the taxation of Individual
clubs at the rate of 10 cents per capita
and State federations at the rate of 25
cents per club, beginning with 1900. Un
der this new ruling an organization like
the Chicago Woman's Club, for instance,
would have Its taxation raised from $10
to $160 biennially. .Many large clubs de
clare they will withdraw if this is done,
but Mrs. Henrotin and the women in
power assert an increased income neces-
sary.
This afternoon at the union meeting of
State presidents and State correspond
ents the question of abolishing: individ
ual clubs from tho General Federation
came up for discussion, the Idea being: to
make the national organization a system
of State bodies. This evening- in the par
lors of the Brown Palace Hotel was held
a reception for the federation officers, the
State and the State chairmen
of correspondence. ,
CLEVELAND
DEPRECATES
EXPANSION
Points Out the Dark Side
of War in an Address
at Princeton.
Advises Americans ,to Refrain
From New and Strange
Adventures.
PRINCETON, N. J.. June 21.â Grover
Cleveland delivered the annual Found-
ers' day address of the commencement |
exercises of the Lawrenc.eville School
here to-day. His address was entitled j
"Good Citizenship," and in the course j
of his remarks he said:
"The American people are tempfed |
every day and every hour to abandon
their accustomed ways and enter upon
a course of new and strange adven
ture. Never before in our history have i
we been beset with temptations so dan- j
Serous as those which now whisper in ;
our ears alluring words of conquest and j
expansion, and point out to us fields j
bright in glory. I only recently saw a i
very useful book entitled 'Don't.' It j
contained a statement of numerous j
things which should not be done. lam j
inclined to adopt the plan of this book j
to the extent of cautioning you against
the imperfect ideas of civic duties and
warn you against certain dangers
which threaten the soundness and
safety of true American citizenship, and ;
which, especially at this particular
time, seem to lie in wait for us on every
side.
"You will probably be led by your re
flections and studies to the conclusion
that pur Government was formed for
the express purpose of creating, |
in a new world, a new nation, j
the foundation of which should be j
man's self-government, whose safety :
and prosperity should be secure ;
to its absolute freedom from old-world i
complications and in its renunciation of
all schemes of foreign conquest, and
whose mission should be the subjuga
tion of civilization and industrial oc
cupation of the vast domain in which
it has taken root. If you believe these
things, do not permit any accusation of
ultra and progressive conservatism to
trouble you.
"If, then, the suggestion is made that
the time has come f>r our nation to
abandon its landmarks and to follow
the lights of monarchical hazards, and
that we should attempt to employ the
simple machinery of our population and
domestic government to serve the
schemes of imperialism, your challenge
of the proposition is entirely in order.
If you are satisfied that foreign con
quest and unnatural extensipn or an
nexation are dangerous perversions of
our national mission, and If it shall
seem to you in the light of reason and
history that such positions bring in
their train a people's demoralization
and a decay of popular content, more
surely destructive to the republic than
armies with banners, you will not
necessarily be wrong.
"With our first century's tremendous
growth â¢ and advancement before our |
eyes as proof of the strength and effl- !
ciency of constant Americanism, you i
will find in the beginning. of our second I
century proof of the abundance of our j
present domain in millions of acres of-;
Government territory still unoccupied.
In view of these things, and consider- j
ing our achievements in the past and j
our promise for the future, recalling |
what we have done and what we have !
been and what yet remains for us to do
under the guidance of the rules andj
motives which have thus far governed j
our national life, you surely are en
titled to demand the best of reasons for j
a change in our policy and conduct and
to expect a conclusive explanation of I
the conditions which make our acquisi
tion of new and distant territory either
justifiable, prudent or necessary.
"Perhaps you should be satisfied with
the excuse that such acquisition is
necessary by way of warlike prepara
tion or precaution. This, however, will
immediately suggest to you that we
have found heretofore a constant source
of congratulation in the fact that the
contemplation of war and its contingen
cies is not and should not be familiar
to our ordinary national life, that it
has also been our boast that a large
standing military establishment and
warlike preparations are not among the
needs of the people whose victories are
those of peace and whose immunity
from armed conflict is found in their
freedom from foreign relationships that
give birth to war; and though it has
been abundantly demonstrated that the
courage and splendid fighting qualities
of our countrymen will never fail in
time of need, it is still a grave question
whether the cheapening of our estimate
of the value of peace, by dwelling upon
war and warlike preparations, is calcu
lated to improve the quality of our
national character.
"These considerations naturally lead
me to counsel you against the danger
of allowing the bright dress and gay
trappings which war puts on to divert
your attention from the ugly features
that belong to it. as seen in the light of
true American citizenship. The danger
of such diversion may arise from rest
less enthusiasm, which is by no means
unattractive; or from our admiration
for deeds of valor, which is a national
characteristic; or from the fascination
of dangerous adventure, never found
without bravery; or from the love of
glory of successful battle, which is al
most an impulse of humanity; or from
a tendency to combativeness, which, if
not altogether lovely and amiable, is
regarded by genuine Americans with
benevolent tolerance.
"It is difficult to deal with the <iues
tlon of war at this time and avoid mis
conception and misrepresentation. But
we are considering American citizen
ship and endeavoring to find its best
and most elevating characteristics and
how they can be most effectively cul
tivated and securely preserved. From
Imdpoint war is a hateful thing,
we should avoid a 9 antagonistic
Jbjects of our national existence,
?atening demoralization of our
il character and as obstructive
national destiny. If you believe
v should stand bravely for your
even though a shower of stupid
ay fill the air.
"The great American general of this
country, after leading immense armies
to victory and after having served two
terms as President, said: 'I never went
into a battle willingly, or with enthusi
asm. I was always glad when a battle
was over. I never want to command
another army. I take no interest in
armies.'
"When he wrote 'Let us have pea.cc'
he gave to his countrymen of this fu
ture generation the most inspiring ex
ample of greatness and true American
citizenship. Sherman, who marched- to
the sea and had his full share of the
glories and the triumphs of the war,
gave his own description of it in his
own style, when he said, 'War is hell.'
"We are told by the brave and gal
lant Admiral Dewey, whose recent dar
ing achievements and successes in war
have added new glory to his country's
name and aroused the enthusiasm of
every American, while waiting in a
foreign port for the command that sent
him to the scene of his victory, wrote
these words to his sister: 'But, after
all, war is a terrible thing, and some
way out of the dilemma may be found
without resorting to it. 1
"While suggesting to you the for
bidding traits of war, I should be guilty
of an attempt to mislead if I fail to
promptly remind you that there are
conditions wh.;h not only justify war,
but make a resort to i.t a duty. No na
tion, however peacefully inclined, and
whatever the consequences may be, can
determine that it will in no circum
stances engage in war. Bad as it is,
and deplorable as its incidents are, no
Government can refuse war at the risk
of imperiling its existence or sacrific
ing the rights and interests it holds in
trust for its peo-le and for humanity
and civilization. Of course, we can
not be entirely exempt from the condi
tions which may force a nation into
war any more than an individual can
b" exempt from the Incidents that may
force the most peaceful man to a per
sonal encounter.

MONADNOCK IN
BATTLE TRIM
Leaves Mare Island for
San Francisco.
SAILS AMID RINGING CHEERS
DEAFENING WHISTLES AND A
SEA OF FLAGS.
Monitor's Voyage to Manila Will
Begin as Soon as Her
Consort Is
Ready.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO. June 21.â Amid a din of
tteam whistles, waving of flags and
cheers of throngs of people, the -moni
tor Monadnock cast off her lines at
Mare Island this morning and slowly
steamed down' the strait and out of
Bight around Mare Island. The depar
ture was made the occasion of a great
demonstration, as the vessel was
launched in Vallejo fifteen years ago
and completed by Vallejo mechanics at
Mare Island, going into commission in
1896.
It was shortly after 11 o'clock when
the ship left the quay wall at Mare
Island. As her lines dropped away and
her propellers began to churn the water
the crews of the Pensacola, Rush and
Corwin broke into hearty cheers, which
â were answered by the crew of the mon
itor. The workmen on Mare Island
gathered in groups and added their
cheers to the din that bade the fighting !
vessel farewell. The seamstresses in |
the flag loft crowded the windows, wav- j
ing bright-hued bunting, and Captain i
"Whiting and his gallant crew acknowl- i
edged the patriotic display by waving ;
their caps and â¢ hearty cheers. Pass-
Ing the Independence the crew of the
receiving ship manned the rigging and ;
roof of the old vessel and cheered the !
Monadnock again and again, ttys blue- i
jackets on the latter vessel heartily j
responding.
On the way down the bay the whis- \
ties of every steamer, tug, launch and â 
factory sent out a long farewell to the
departing vessel.
The Monadnock will lie at San Fran- i
cisco till the cargo of her consort, the j
Nero, is completed, when she will sail
for Manila via Honolulu.
The coast defense steamer Monadnock
came down from the navy-yard yester
day. She left Mare Island at 11:20 a, m.
and made a quick run t>-> the city. The
Nero is almost ready for sea and the
chances are. that she and the Monadnock
will get away with the fleet of transports
next Monday.
AMERICANS SLAIN BY
BLANCO'S BLOODY PEN
Official Report of the Repulse of a
Landing Force at Punta
Cabrera.
HAVANA, June 21.â 0n Friday
morning last the United States battle
ship Texas, it is announced, endeav
ored to cover the" landing of an Ameri
can force at Punta Cabrera, Province
of Santiago de Cuba, but, the report
adds, the Americans were repulsed by
the Spanish troops under Colonel Al
dea, with the loss of several men. The,
firing, it is further asserted, lasted a
half hour.
It is announced at the palace that a
Spanish guerrilla force had been en
gaged with a body of insurgents near
the railroad at Dagame, Province of
Havana, The insurgents, it appears,
exploded a dynamite bomb and the
guerrillas captured another and similar
bomb before it could be exploded; after
which the insurgents are said to have
retired with losses. The Spaniards had
three men wounded.
Another palace announcement sets
forth that six Spanish sailors recently
surprised an American camp near Cayo
Piedra, not far from Cardenas, Prov
ince of Matanzas, capturing: "kitchen
utensils and provisions." But it seems
"other Americans appeared, fired on
the Spaniards and pursued them until
they reached the Spanish gunboat
Deign, which was struck by a Mauser
bullet."

IS READY NOW
TO ARBITRATE
Los Angeles Council So
Announces.
FARCE NOT NEAR AN ENDING
LATEST NOTICE TO THE WATEB
COMPANY.
City Officials Faithfully Observing
the Terms of a Contract That
Will Never Be En- *
forced.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, June 21.â The City
Council to-day completed another act
of the farce which can properly be
termed the carrying out of the terms of
a contract which is never going to be
enforced. At its session this morning
the Council decided to issue no bonds
in advance of learning the price to be
fixed for the water company's plant by
arbitration. It then proceeded with
great deliberation and with apparent
earnestness to declare it was ready to
arbitrate and invited the water com
pany to join in the arbitration. After
this had been done an adjournment to
Friday was taken.
While everything that the Council is
now doing in this matter for the pur
pose of complying with the contract is
known by those who have studied the
question to be absolutely useless, no
single Councilman seems to have suf
ficient courage to stand up and tell his
colleagues and the people that muni
cipal ownership is not going to be ob
tained.
Mayor Snyder has returned to the
city. He says he was not absent on
municipal business, but was attending
to private matters. He was present at
the session of the Council to-day and is j
closely watching events, but is power- j
less to do anything.

Special Dlspatcli to The Call.
SATJSALJTO, June 21.â Glynn, Broy- â¢
er and Humphrey to-day cast down
the gauntlet to the Board of Town
Trustees and opened their poolrooms
opposite the Buffalo Hotel, in order to
test the validity of the ordinance which
empowers the Trustees to grant or'
withhold licenses for poolrooms at will?;
Up to a late hour no arrests had been '
made, but the board held several con- j
sultations in regard to the mode of j
procedure, and finally came to an un
derstanding that to-morrow the various !
members of the rival concern shall all |
be placed under arrest. The dealers in j
question have told Justice Belroot that I
they intend to swear out warrants for I
the arrest of both Harrison and Har
vey in case they themselves are molest
ed, though the grounds were not men
tioned.
The general sentiment seems to favor
the action of the Trustees. The new
poolrooms were busy to-day, the crowd
surging back and forth between them
and Harrison's rooms, to the disad
vantage of Harvey.

Killed Himself With a Live Wire.
FRESNO. June 21.â ' W. H. Norris. half
owner of the electric light plant at Por
tervllle, and a prominent citizen, com
mitted suicide last night by taking hold
of a live wire.
Do you want to continue to be a halting, half-hearted weakling? Why
not be full of power? Nature is treating you justly. You have not
treated her fairly. You have not used your power sensibly. Having
done what was wrong you are now suffering. But why continue to
suffer? "Hudyan" has done wonders for thousands of men. It will
make up for all the errors you have committed. "Hudyan" saves life.
"Hudyan" makes manhood. Circulars and testimonials about it are as
free as sunshine. Get them. No matter how you may have abused your
big strength, "Hudyan" will make you a well and a happy man again.
If that seems too good to be trueâ ask what it has done for others. It
will cost you not one cent. Nor will the best medical advice in the
world. Why not have it ?

SCHEMES OF
THE KAISER
Germany \et Disposed
to Interfere.
"CHOP LOGIC" OF BERLIN
IS MAKING USE OF A SILLY
PRETENSE.
Pretends to Regard Philippine Na
tives and Not America as the
Power to Deal
With.
Special Cable to The Call and New Tork Her
ald. Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gordon Ben
nett.
PARIS, June 21. â Germany's repudia
1 tion of any intention to intervene in
the Philippines is received only half
: heartedly here. The Journal dcs De
bats' Berlin correspondent lets the cat
i out of the bag. According to him
America does not hold the Philippines.
It is the natives who menace them
more than the Americans. This "chop
logic" is used to show that Germany
may be compelled to step in.
"If Spain loses this colony," says Dcs
Debats, "it could only become a native
republic."
You will notice nothing is said, about
the fact that only Admiral Dewey's
victory made Aguinaldo's successes
possible. Such a republic must be re
garded by the whole of Europe as com
promising the progress of civilization in
those regions. If Russia France and
England were brought to intervene,
then only could Germany break a\v:iy
from her strict neutrality. France's
action would depend upon what Rus
sia did. Germany might, therefore,
again succeeed in swinging France into
line for the furtherance of her far
Eastern plans.
It is palpable Germany's Emperor
has some hidden line of conduct which
he is pursuing with reerard to the Ma
lay archipelago. Whatever it may be,
the mere idea of his interference in the
question is regarded here as likely to
unite all sections of the United States
in favor of annexation pure and sim
ple. A decision of this kind would prob
ably bring about a disposition of the
powers with Germany, France and
Russia on one side and the United
States and England on the other.
It is suggested here that there might
be a dual protectorate by the United
States and the Spanish Governments
over the islands. This could be con
tinued until the war indemnity and ex
penses have been paid. In the mean
time roads, railways and telegraphs
could be constructed, an educational
scheme put into operation, freedom for
religious customs guaranteed and lib
eral municipal and provincial govern
ments organized. Then at the proper
time a plebiscite of the inhabitants
could decide between one of four des
tinies â to remain under the dual pro
tectorate, become a Federal colony of
America, return to Spain, or become
independent. This solution would prob
ably satisfactorily settle the question
in accordance with American ideas of
freedom and at the same time nip the
German Emperor's ambitious schemes
in the bud, or at any rate give him a
Roland for his Oliver.
PACIFIC GROVE BOY'?
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
Lost in the Mountains Three Days
and Nights and Nearly Dead
When Found.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., June 21.-Chris
Speegle, the 12-year-old son of W. Speegle
of this town, has just undergone a terri
ble experience, and while the boy is in
a serious condition it is a marvel that
he Is alive. Whllo camping with some
friends in the Sur country, young Speegle
was lost in the wildest portion of the
mountains, remaining alone and without
food for three entire days before he was
rescued. When found by his friends he
was in a state of temporary mental de
rangement, occasioned by loss of sleep,
lack of food and fright at his situation.
The boy was sent by a member of the
camping party to get some horses that
had been tethered a short distance from
camp, and the fog being very dense he
lost his way in the heavy growth of un
derbrush.
The boy is recovering rapidly from the
severe strain, and it in believed that with
proper care and treatment he will soon
be quite himself.

Â«X INDUSTRIES 1 A YEAR.MERRITT TO SAIL NEXT WEDNESDAY.
MAJOR GENERAL MERRITT,
TJ. S. A., commanding the
Eighth Army Corps, has de
cided to sail for Manila on
the steamship Newport. If
the United States steamship Phila
delphia could be made ready by the
middle of next week the general would
go on the cruiser, but no assurance
can be given of the warship's readi
ness before July 15. The Newport
will sail from this harbor Wednesday
or Thursday of next week and may
overtake the third expedition at
Honolulu.
The third transport fleet of the Phil
ippine expeditionary forces will sail
from San Francisco next Monday The
five steamshipa-the Indiana, the Ohio,
the City of Para, the Morgan City and
lvi \^ ncia - r Â°â¢Prising the flotilla,
will all be ready for the reception of the
troops not later than Saturday, and
some of them will be prepared for the
embarkation of the soldiers to-morrow
or Friday. The Valencia will be the
last one to be got in readiness, owing
to several needed repairs and improve
ments, which are being completed as
rapidly as possible under the supervi
sion of Major Long, the depot quarter
master.
Brigadier General Mac Arthur, com
manding the third brigade, will, with
his staff, sail on the- Indiana, which of
course, will be the flagship of the fleet
The Pacific Mail Bteamship Newport
has been chartered by the Government
and added to this fleet, but she will not
sail until Wednesday. Major General
Merritt and his stair will take their de
parture on the Newport, which, being a
fast boat, will easily overtake the fleet
before it reaches Manila. The
of the five transports will be regulated
by the Blowest steamer ot the flotilla
which is the Morgan City. Her speed
is not more than nine or ten knots an
hour.
The addition of the Newport to the
squadron mak.'s room for about COO
more troops, and this room win be oc
cupied by infantry and artillery of the
regular army, but from what regiments \
they will be taken has not yet been de
cided. In all probability the artillery !
will come from the Third Regiment, j
and possibly the Astor Independent '
Battery will be included.

CALIFORNIA'S NEW REGIMENT.
Companies Selected From the Second
and Fifth to Rendezvous at

â  n of the twelve companies that will form the Eighth California
Volunteers have been definitely decided upon by Governor Budd, and the
twelfth will be selected to-day. The lucky organizations are as follows:

Adjutant General Barrett stated last night that while the Governor had
practical!: upon the twelfth company, he had concluded to con
sular the mutter over night, and would make the format announcement to
day. General Barrett s:i id positively that the choice was between the
three remaining: companies of the Fifth Infantry, Company A, of Oakland;
K. of Santa Rosa, and 11, of Napa, as the Governor had made up his mind
to draw six companies from each regiment.
As i))<- frit-nils of each of these three companies are making a desperate
fight for the honor, and one company â F â has already been selected from
Oakland, it is not likely that another company will be drawn from that city.
This narrows the fignt down to Santa Rosa and Napa, and those who are
In a position to make a shrewd guess give the plum to Santa Rosa. The
- of Company E are C. E. Haven, captain; Charles 11. Holmes Jr.,
lirst lieutenant; Willard C. Bean, second lieutenant. The officers of Com
pany H. of Napa, are F. W. Bush, captain; 11. L. Gunn, first lieutenant;
A. K. Hart, second lieutenant.
â  I : ! Park Henshaw arrived from Chlco yesterday morning, and with
Lieutenant Colonel Carrlngton and Captain C. H. iiurray, Fourth Cavalry,
the mustering officer of the new regiment, was In conference with the Gov
ernor and General Barrett until late in the afternoon. The personnel and
equipment of every company remaining in the National Guard was care
fully considered, and when all had been gone over the Governor announced
thai be would divide the honors evenly between the Second and Fifth Reg
imen: . b regiment consisted of eight companies, and all were clam
oring for â¢ n, it was a difficult matter to select the favored ones,
!iut eventually the choice of eleven companies was made, and a prelimi
nary order prepared, which will go out to-day with the necessary blanks,
ordering the captains to recruit up to the maximum of 106 officers and men,
and to have every man physically examined according to army regula
tions.
Then came the question of mustering in the companies and many plans
were discussed, with the result that :is soon as the preliminary examina
tion is finished the companies will be ordered to rendezvous at or near
and. There they will be regularly examined, equipped and mustered
into the volunteer service.
Colonel HenÃhaw and Captain Murray went to Oakland late in the affer
r.oon to examine several tracts offered for the rendezvous, but they made
no report last night. It is probable, however, that the Oakland race track
or a field in that vicinity will be selected.
Governor Budd and General Barrett are determined that the new regi
ment, which will be designated as the Eighth California Volunteers in
honor of Colonel Henshaw's former command, will be fully equipped before
it is turned over to General Otis, and yesterday orders were given to pur
chape blankets and blue woolen overshirts for the men. Every man will
:iy uniformed by the Su-te and all that will have to be supplied by
itep will bo a few leggings, canteens and haversacks.
About 4SO rifles will have to be drawn from the lienieia arsenal.
The greatest care will be taken in Rtlecticg the men and the Eightn
bid:; fair to be the banner regiment of the California volunteers.
Nothing whatever has been don>* toward selecting the field and staff of
from Colonel Henshaw and Lieutenant Colonel Carrlngto.i.
Those two gentlemen have announced to the Governor that they would ac
cept the appointments mil there llw matter will rest until the commani
is rendesvoused. It is admitted, tbougii, that Colonel A. K. Whitton of San
ndet favorable, consideration by the Governor for major -;f <Â»ne
ttaUons and h<- will undoubtedly be appointed. Colonel J. F. Bur
gin <.f !);â¢â  Governor's staff frankly admits that he would consider the ten
der of a majorship a great honor, and while he has not spoken to Gov
ernor Budd upon the subject, he is not 1/kely to be overlooked.
Captain George B. Baldwin, a warm personal friend of Colonel Henshaw,
Colonel Carrington and almost everybody else, for he is one of the most
popular men in the State, seems to have the adjutantcy well within his
grasp, while Captain J. A. Margo, who was appointed commissary' on the
staff of Colonel J. F. Smith, but was not accepted by the War Department
because the regular regiments do not have specially appointed commis
saries, is a prominent candidate for quartermaster. As the Governor gave
nirn one appointment which was abolished he may be given a place in the
new regiment.
There are hundreds of applicants for appointment as chief ana assist
ant surgeons, many of the best-known physicians in the State having been
seized with a longing to serve their country, but they, too, must wait,
for the regiment will not be rendezvoused before the end of the week.
Philadelphia, which at first was
thought to be so nearly completed that
it could be got ready for sea by July
1, but yesterday it was positively as
certained that she could not leave her
dock at Mare Island navy-yard before
July 8, and that it would take until the
15th to have her coaled and to get
steam up, ami otherwise prepared for
the proposed trip to Manila. There
fore, the idea of employing the Phila
delphia was abandoned by General
Merritt
No official confirmation has been re
ceived at army headquarters of the
newspaper .dispatch from Washington
to the effect that an additional army
corps, to be known as the Eighth, is to
be formed and to be put under the com
mand of Major General Otis, but it is
nevertheless accepted as a settled fact
that such a corps is to be organized,
as it was recommended by Major GenÂ«
eral Merritt.

DIVISION HEADQUARTERS.
General Mac Arthur Receives
Ordersâ Colonel Frost Takes
the Fourth Brigade.
Despite the orders recently issued from
! division headquarters instructing the
| troops comprising the- next expedition to
Manila to be in readiness to sail to-mor
row, there is not the slightest possibil
ity that the troops will Ret away before
: Saturday, and in all probability not until
! Monday of next week.
The addition of the Newport to the fleet
I of transports means that another regt
ment will go with the expedition, and
1 while r.o orders were issued yesterday by
General Otis designating the regiment, it
seems to be the geenral impression in
camp that the Seventh California, the
Twentieth Kansas and First Montana reg
iments are the commands from which
the selection will be made. Of these the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 22, 1898.
COMMANDER OF THE NEW CALIFORNIA REGIMENT.
Park Hensbaw, Who Has Been Commissioned Colonel of the State's Troops That
Will Respond to the President's Second Call.
Park Henshaw was born in Missouri fifty years ago. He was educated in the common schools of his native
State and afterward took a course in the law department of the University of Michigan. lie came to California
in 3SCS and has resided in Butte County aver since.
Colonel Henshaw entered the National Guard in irS7. He was assistant adjutant general on Brigadier General
Montgomery's staff. After several Â»ars of hard" work in the Legislature he succeeded in having a sufficient num
ber of companies of the National Guard assigned to the Fifth Brigade to make a buttalion, of which he was
elected lieutenant colonel. The battalion was then raised to a regiment, and Colonel Henshaw was elected com
manding officer. Colonel Henshaw was in command of this regiment during the strike of 1594, and on July 4
was ordered by General Dimond to arrest a tralnload of strikers en route from Dunsmuir to Sacramento. In
obedience to this order he tore ua th>- track near Chlco, stationed two companies of the National Guard about
half a mile from the city limits, i smaller party being assigned further up the railroad, concealed under a
bridge, to take up a rail behind the train after it had passed, thus preventing the strikers from going either
backward or forward. When this was accomplished Colonel Henshaw was ordered by General Dimond to
withdraw his men and permit the striken to pas.;.
He afterward served in Sacramento with his regiment and received the highest praise from General Gra
ham, the regular army commander at that point.
Colonel Henshaw has been on Governor Budd's staff for the past two years as inspector general of rifle
practice, and in that capacity has labored continuously and with much success to advance target practice in
this State. The appointment of Colonel Henshaw as colonel of the now regiment gives universal satisfaction.
rejoicing among the men when the sup
plies were issued. Colonel Smith also
hopes to have the regiment thoroughly
equipped with arms and other accouter
ments before the week is out.
Colonel Jones, commanding the two Idaho
battalions, has been Incapacitated from
duty for the past few days owing to the
effects of his vaccination. He was quite
sick for a while, but yesterday he had
sufficiently recovered to leave his room
and visit his command for a while. Dur
ing his absence Major D. W. Figgins is in
charge of the battalions.
The Wyoming battalion put in the morn
ing yesterday at the Presidio, doing tar
get "practice. The average scores were
from 20 to 25, which is a very high ] per
centage, and it shows that Major Fooic
has some excellent marksmen in his com
mand.
Private James A. Lafflin. Company K.
Twenty-third I'nited States Infantry, died
at the field hospital yesterday of a com
plication of pneumonia and measles. He
will be buried at 2 o'clock this afternoon
in the National Cemetery at the Pre
sidio.
Thirty recruits from Oregon arrived
yesterday at Camp Merritt and over 100
more will arrive to-day- They will 1*;
quartered on the recruits from Minnesota,
under command of Major Diggles, until
an opportunity is found to ship them to
their regiment.
Colonel Reeve of the Thirteenth Minne
sota will leave in charge of his 300 re
cruits and the 150 sent from Oregon, Ma
jor Diggles, with six lieutenants, eight
sergeants and twelve corporals.
Taptain Milliken. son of Congressman
Milliken of Maine, has been appointed
chief commissary of subsistence on the
staff of Brigadier General Harrison Gray
Otis. Captain Milliken graduated from
West Point in 1897 and soon after re
signed to go into business. When the
war with Spain was declared he offered
his services, which were accepted.
Brigadier General H. G. Otis will be the
chief guest at a dinner to be given at the
Bohemian Club to-morrow evening. It is
expected that Governor Richards of Wy
oming. Governor Budd of California, May
or Pnelan of this city, and James A.
Thompson, president of the club, will at
tend the function.
SHIPS FOR THE TROOPS.
Stores and MunitionsGo Aboard
the Transports â Valencia
to the Drydock.
There were busy times at the trans
ports yesterday.
Among the articles going to Manila on
the Ohio, Indiana, Morgan City and City
of Para are large consignments of plain
wire, barbed wire, cement and sacks.
The consignments of the latter will con
tain a sack for every man who has left
or will leave San Francisco fjjr Manila,
and before the fighting begins each man
will be supplied with his sack. This will
go into his haversack with his other be
longings and will form part of his outfit.
Supposing, then, a lot of the soldiers
are out skirmishing in Manila and tbe
Spaniards begin to descend on them.
Each man outs with his sack, fills it with
sand and, lying down behind it, pops
away at the advancing foe. As soon as
the "fighting is over the bag is emptied
and restored to Its place In the haver
sack, ready for use when the next skir
mish occurs.
The plain wire is to be used in building
a telegraph system over the island of Lu
zon and the barbed wire Is for use at
night. Rows of It set up at dusk would
give any Spanish troops who might make
I a rush at the camp a surprise before they
[ reached a striking distance. The cement
is to be used for the construction of en
trenchments. All in all it looks as though
Uncle Sam intends to hold what he has
won and in holding it expects a good deal
of guerrilla warfare.
The coaling of the fleet has been com
pleted and all that now remains is the
provisioning and gftiing the BOldiers
aboard. The City of Para and Morgan
City are nearest completion and the Ohio
and Indiana will be in readiness on Sat
urday. On the last named steamers the
ventilation is very Imperfect in the lower
deck and the troops who ;m- quartered
there will suffer from the heat in the
tropics. The Valencia has to go on the
<iry dock for an overhauling and the
chances are that she will nut go away
with the next fleet to sail.
It will take two days to unload the City
of Puebla, which arrived from Puget
Bound yesterday. As soon as the cargo
has been removed she will be turned over
to the United States Government au

MANY MEN ILL.
Trouble Caused by Impure
Water in the Sixth
Infantry.
There is an alarming amount of sick
ness among the members of the battal
ions of the Sixth Infantry, stationed at
Fort Point, which is attributed to the
water. Yesterday thirty members of one
company were on the sick list, and an
other company did not have a corporal
who was able to go on guard. The water
used at the camp comes from Mountain
Lake and it will probably be necessary to
sterilize the writer before it can be used.
The men are attacked with serious bowel
complaint, and as there is no surgeon
attached to the battalion the sufferers
must shift for themselves.
The matter was reported to Governor
Budd yeaterday. and he will make a
strong 'effort to have another Burgeon ap
pointed for duty with the battalion. The
Sixth was only allowed two surgeons, one
being Bent to Benicia aud the other to
Santa ("niz.
The battalion is also suffering from lack
of overcoats, which the quartermaster's
depot cannot supply, and in consequence
Adjutant General Barrett has ordered
siimi' State overcoats sent out to the men.
who are obliged to march on guard
around the fortifications, exposed to the
severe winds.
The battalion began drilling with the
big guns and dynamite throwers yester
day, which would indicate that it' is the
intention to keep it at Fort Point.
COLORED VOLUNTEERS.
Governor Budd Promises to
Assist Them in Joining
the Army.
Major Li. M. Penny, commanding- the pro
posed Twenty-eighth Regiment of colored
volunteers of the State of California. has
recruited 800 men for that organization.
A numerously signed petition of well
known citizens has been presented to Gov
ernor Budd asking that when the quota
of the regiments in the Held is filled to
the maximum that of the new companies
to be formed at least 100, or a battalion of
the colored men in Major Penny's regi
ment, be sent to the front. The petition
ers believe they can stand the climate as
well as their white brethren, if not bet
ter. In organizing his regiment Major
Penny has worked very hard and has
been assisted by Captain KeHing. The
petitioners think that the colored people
should have recognition in this war and
be officered by men of their own color.
Furthermore, that Major Penny should
be retained in his command. Governor
Budd has expressed the opinion that the
colored men are entitled to an opportuni
ty to serve their country in the present
war, and he proposes to assist them in
their efforts.
TO SAIL FOR MANILA
ON MONDAY NEXT
Major General Otis Names the
Sailing Day of the Third
Fleet.
Th<; latest date set for the sailing of
the third expedition for the Philippines
is the 27th inst.
The following orders, issued yester
day by Major General Otis, names the
day for departure:
Brigadier General Arthur McArthur,
United States Volunteers, having been
designated from the United States Expe
ditionary forces and Department of the
Pacific to command the troops of the next
expedition to depart for the Philippines
on' or about the 27th inst., is relieved
from the command of the Fourth Brigade
of the diviison and will supervise the
military instruction of the troops which
have been selected for embarkation, plac
ing them in as efficient condition in that
regard as possible. These troops will re

their departure.
DIPHTHERIA IN CAMP.
Surgeons Perceive That Pre-
cautions Ivlust Be Taken to
Arrest the Disease.
The several cases of diphtheria sent on
Monday from Camp Merritt to the Marine
Hospital are under rigid treatment at that
place.
Yesterday three severe cases of diph
theritic sore throat developed in different
sections of the camp. They have been
carefully isolated. Every precaution is
being taken to check the epidemic that is
threatening the camp. Thnre is not a
surgeon in camp who does not realize and
admit that conditions are right for a rapid
spread of almost any contagious disease
that may once g*jt a foothold. Sanitary
conditions are daily growing worse, and
the camp is ripe for a serious spread of
the disease that is now so greatly dread
ed.

THE EMPORIUM.
IRISHMEN HONOR
DEAD PATRIOTS
ANNIVERSARY OF WOLFE TONE
AND THE REBELLION.
Rev. P. C. Yorke Speaks for Irish
Liberty and Against an Anglo-
Saxon Alliance.
Patriotic Irishmen turned out in full
force last Bight at the exercises held tti
Metropolitan Temple to celebrate the, an
niversaries of Wolfe Tone and the Rebel
lion of "as. The exercises opened with a
few remarks by James 11. Barry, chair
man of, the evening:, who paid a splendid
tribute to the memory of the famous Irish
patriot and his brave followers, who laid
down their lives fighting for the freedom
of their native country. He then intro
duced the speaker of the evening, Rev.
P. C. Yorke. who had chosen "The Spirit
of 'PS" as his subji ct.
"We are come." said the speaker, "to
remember the r.ir-n who, over 100 years
ago, died in what at the time seemed a
lost cause, and it is most fining: at this
time when American soKUera are fight
ing to free an oppressed country, that we
should come tog-ether to honor the mem
ory of a man who was a martyr to lib
erty.
'The spirit of 'OS is the spirit that de
manda that the government of the people
be of the people arid for the people, and
not that there be two classes, the one to
govern and the other to be governed. It
stands for the prh"oiple that the govern
ment which wrongs the people is not a
government, and it ceases to be when it
ceases to be useful. If ever there was a
nation which was entitled to self govern
ment It is Irdand, as it not only ranks
highest as a nation in antiquity and
learning, but also has the additional ana
stronger claim of fighting and suffering
for it even as Cuba has fought and suf
fered. S*.e has fought century after cen
tury, and at the end of the nineteenth
century, thank God, she is not past fight
ing.
"It is a glorious thing to say of Theo
bald "Wolfe Tone that he reached out his
hands to Protestant and Catholic aJike,
and bade them remember that they wera
not two churches fighting one another,
but brothers fighting to blend the orangÂ«
and the green together and fight against
a common wrong.
"They are now talking of an Anglo-
Saxon alliance, and say that the Ameri
can eagle should lie down with the Brit
ish lion, but shall we listen to such talk?
We are not Anglo-Saxor.s. In fact, all
the Angl<T-Saxons in this country amount
to is a Hide knot of men who sit around
a table on St. George's Day. We will
not drag our American flag on the tail
of the British lion, as we need no pro
tection from the red rag of England. We
would be hypocrites to enter into leagua
in the cause of liberty with a nation
whose whole history is red with the blood
of patriots fighting against her opprÂ«s
sion."
He closed hi 3 address with a tribute to
all who had given up their lives in tha
fight for Irish liberty, and expressed theÂ»
hope that the cause would soon be won.
During the evening vocal and instru
mental selections were rendered by Jos
eph Roeckel, John J. Raffael, Miss Daisy
V. Keane and Mme. Ellen Coursen-Roee
kel. Thomas W. Hlckey gave several
recitations, which were well received.
Another Setback for Shysters.
Captain Wlttman issued Instructions to
the police patrol drivers yesterday for
bidding their giving out any information
regarding arrests to the irregular prac
titioners of the law who prey upon the
unfortunate at the city prisons.

FIRST WITH THE NEWS.
AS a rule The Call is willing to let its news from
the seats of war commend itself. That this
news is more complete, correct and up to date
than that of any other paper in the West is a fact
which all must acknowledge, and wnfch all but the
other papers do acknowledge cheerfully.
To revert to a recent illustration or two cannot be
a breach of modesty. That Aguinaldo had declared
the Philippines independent was published in these
columns Saturday. Local sheets, spurred to an idea
that they were rivals, printed the same information
Monday morning. As to the arrival of American
troops at Santiago, they managed to get the news,
but to do so had to draw upon the cables forwarded
by the Herald-Call syndicate. By some unwonted
touch of decency the Examiner in printing this gave
credit to the source. With every intent to permit
the devil to have his due, this mitigating fact is men
tioned. Still, it is far from being a justification of
the act of larceny. The news was copyrighted, and
for the Examiner to take it was to steal.
We have refrained, also, from attaching to the staff
the crowned heads of Europe, the Ministers of Spain
and a lot of yellow liars. We confess freely the ina
bility to print the inmost thoughts of the Vatican,
that Bismarck is not on our payroll, that the Kaiser
docs not make of The Call an especial confidant, and
never routed any of our representatives out of bed
for the purpose of painting him a picture of the war
cloud. All this palpable and palling nonsense is left
to such saffron freaks as the Examiner. The Call
is content to print the news, to print ft first, and or
dinarily to say nothing about the daily task of scooping
the other papers. They realize the defeat, and there
is little utility in "rubbing it in."
CALIFORNIA IN THE WAR.
NOTHING could better illustrate the progress of
the West than the record this State is making
in the present war, compared with the record it
made in the sixties. Then California was sparsely
settled, remote from the rest of the country. Now
it has developed into a mighty commonwealth, and
at the call to military service has thousands more men
to offer than are needed. It has more than two regi
ments under arms, one of them probably now in the
Philippines, the other eagerly awaiting the order to
go. It is to muster in a third complete regiment, and
proud as we are of the volunteers in service, those
who are yet to take the oath of allegiance to Uncle
Sam will be as much a credit to California, The
only embarrassment arises from the eagerness of still
others to enlist.
It is not only that its young men sprang by thou
sands to answer the summons to arms, that one of
its regiments was the first to start against a foreign
foe, that California exults. The spirit of patriotism
manifest in every quarter of the great State has been
so emphatic and unanimous that each heart has been
stirred. There has not been heard a voice of dis
sent. Regardless of party the acfrnfnistration has
been upheld, and the war it wages pronounced a
righteous one. But there has been shown, also, a
splendid hospitality, which, without the shadow of a
selfish motive, has "cast bread on the waters." The
women have from the first been as eager as the men
to display their ardor. They have welcomed the sol
dier as he came, fed and nursed him while he stayed
and bade him godspeed as he departed. On distant
fields and on alien seas he will remember the women
with blessings.
It is no idle boast to sa r / that California has done
well. Alone and unaided, this State could, if neces
sary, raise an army, and gladly would that army go
forth to battle for the flag.
Members of the 'Astor battery appear distressed by
the fear that somebody will fail to recognize the fact
that they are regulars. Let It be understood that
they are regulars, and the first soldiers of any va
riety who have arrived here led by a man who did
not appreciate proffered courtesies. lie seems to
have secured somewhere a hunk of the sort of meat
on which that other great military captain, one Caesar,
fed, thereafter swelling noticeably.
Enough horses and mules died on the way to Cuba
to show that the equine bound for Manila will con
stitute a poor insurance risk. This fatality is hard to
understand when it is remembered that early Spanish
soldiers brought horses across. Perhaps the modern
animal has undermined his constitution by high
living.
According to a local contemporary the war com
ments of the New York World provoke a smile.
Such is not the case. If anybody takes the trouble
to read them they may provoke a sneer. This is
their present limit.
London advices Btate that there is a movement on
foot for peace between the United States and Spain.
There are several. General Shaftcr is conducting
one of them.
OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
WAR by its impressive object lessons is teaching
the American people that in years past they
have been guilty of many serious sins of omis
sion as a nation. We now clearly perceive that we
have been not economical but parsimonious and
wasteful in not providing for the construction of the
Nicaragua canal, the extension of the navy, the en
largement of the army, the more effective organiza
tion of the National Guard, and last, but by no means
least, the expansion and upbuilding of our merchant
marine.
In the present emergency the skill of our naval
constructors by building battle-ships capable of mak
ing the voyage around the Horn in speedy time has
enabled us to overcome the lack of the interoceanic
canal. The comparative weakness and inertness of
the foe renders our small navy sufficient for the de
fense of our coast and the conquest of Spanish colo
nies. The response of the young men of the nation
to the call for volunteers is rapidly making up for the
smallness of the regular army. There is nothing,
however, that makes up for the lack of a merchant
marine commensurate to our size as a nation. Ships
cannot be built in a day, and as a result in our need
for transports we have been compelled to admit for
eign ships to American registry in order to dispatch
an army to the aid of Dewcy at Manila.
The lesson of war on this subject confirms what
has long been taught by that of peace. For years
we have been paying a costly tribute to foreign coun
tries to carry on our commerce. The ample balances
of trade in our favor, a 9 shown by a comparison of
exports with imports, have been seriously rÂ«duccd
every year by the drain of money required to pay
foreign shipowners for freight on both the exports
and the imports. What was costly in times of peace
is more costly in war, because of higher marine in
surance, and the need of an enlarged merchant ma
rine is therefore more impressive this year than ever.
An extensive system of subsidies or other form
of governmental aid is essential to the shipping in
terests of any nation in these days. Great Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Russia and even Japan ex
tend a strong and far-reaching aid to both their ship
builders and their shipowners. It is by this aid
they have established their commerce upon the sea,
and it is not too much to say that if either one of
them withdrew the favor it gives to its shipping the
flag of that nation would soon disappear from the
commercial ports of the world.
American merchants and shipbuilders are as enter
prising and as full of resources as any other of our
great captains of industry. They have accomplished
much in the face of the competition of European
shipping, liberally fostered and promoted by govern
mental aid. They cannot, however, do everything.
We can never have a merchant marine equal to the
needs of the country in war or peace until our Gov
ernment is as wise as those of Europe in promoting
the creation and maintenance of one. The experi
ence of the last few weeks in getting transports for
our troops shows how important is our need in this
respect, and Congress should not adjourn until some
thing has been done to place our shipowners on an
equal footing with foreign competitors.
ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC PROGRAMME.
WE directed attention a few days ago to an edi
torial of the Richmond Times, warmly com
mending the adoption by the Democratic party
of a policy opposed to what it called "Imperialism."
The Times desired the representatives of the party
in Congress to get rid of Bryan and Bryanism by
substituting a new platform in place of that adopted
at Chicago. It proposed that the fight in the Con
gressional elections this fall should be made not for
free silver, nor against the Supreme Court, but for
what it called the "old-time traditions of Democracy"
and against annexation of any islands or territorial
extension of any kind.
That was one way to get rid of Bryanism. Now
the Louisville Post, which speaks for the Democracy
of Kentucky with as much authority as the Rich
mond Times speaks for that of Virginia, comes for
ward with another plan for eliminating Bryan from
the future. It says:
"We wish to have the Democratic party put the
past behind it; we wish it to turn from 1896 to 1000,
to 1910, with views and planj and policies for a great
development of our international commerce. We
wish to declare for:
"The freedom of Cuba.
"The acquisition of Porto Rico.
"The annexation of Hawaii.
"The acquisition of the Philippine Islands.
"The building of the Nicaragua canal.
"A navy twice the size it is to-day.
"A regular army of 100,000.
"The militia under the drill and the discipline of
the regular army."
With such a divergence of views between Virginia
and Kentucky it is clear that much tobacco must be
smoked and much bourbon drank before an agree
ment is reached. About the only note of harmony
they have emanates from a desire to get rid of Bryan,
and that note is more like a grunt of distress than a
battle cry. The platform search of Democracy is, in

There is only one emotion excited by the Exami

intelligent people should lie so. It may be stated
with confidence that the "interview" was not only a
fake, but a particularly stupid and palpable one.
In refusing to surrender prisoners in exchange, the

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 22, 1898
fJNOTHER POLITICAL PARAPHRASE.
I-'HE approach of the campaign brings from the
Democratic hosts a growl of anger as they find
that the local organization of the party has fallen
into the hands of Bosses McNab, Gould and Al
ford, with the probable addition of Chris Buckley.
The fact that these men, if left undisturbed, will name
the State delegation and municipal convention â thus
dictating the local ticket and the membership of one
fourth of the Democratic State Convention â has
caused much dismay to be felt in the party throughout
the State.
The Democracy is to be congratulated upon the
signs of revolt produced by the autocratic action of
these political brigands. They show that the spirit
of liberty is not dead in the party. We do not speak
from the standpoint of a partisan, but from that of an
honest admirer of pure politics who has never at
tempted to knock the railroad out of $iooo a month on.
a contract for "advertising."
From a partisan standpoint we think nothing could
be better for the Republicans than to have the Demo
cratic party in the hands of the Republican rene
gade, McNab, and the verdant Gould and Alford.
These bosses have no votes and no organization.
True, they have taken possession of the Democratic
machinery of this city, but there are many signs that
in doing so they are in control of nothing but the
shadow of the party. No better proof could be ad
duced of this than the fact that they are afraid to hold
a primary or in any other way give their people a
chance to express themselves. Conscience makes
cowards of us all. "Whispering" McNab's con
science tells him that were he once to submit his
scheme to the people it would be knocked into a
cocked hat.
We do not know how the Democrats are going to
get their party machine out of the hands of the little
band of political highwaymen who have captured it.
The law offers them no remedy. The bosses and
corporations have attended to that. There Is but
one thing for them to do, and that is to set up a howl
for an open primary and at the ballot boxes try con
clusions with Boss McNab's plug uglies. Yet in
such a contest they would have little hope, for they
would be fighting an enemy who knows more tricks
and has fewer scruples than they. They can place
no reliance on the Democratic State Committee, for
McNab, Alford and Gould have already captured that
body.
The Democratic party has men in it who com
mand the respect and confidence of the voters of the
party. There are men whose names are known in
the business and professional world who would rep
resent the majority of the party, instead of the little
minority that now has command. Such men could
doubtless be got to take upon themselves the labor
of managing the party affairs through a campaign.
But it cannot be done with the consent of the gang
that is now in power â "Whispering" Gavin McNab,
"Slough City" Gould and "Tenderfoot" Alford.
WHILE the American people will cheerfully pay
the taxes imposed by the war revenue bill, they
will be very glad when the time comes for the
removal of the burden. Taxes constitute one of the
most disagreeable items of the cost of military glory.
There is one tax in the list, however, which they will
not only pay willingly now, but would be glad to
have continued indefinitely by reason of its bearing
upon the pure food question. That is the tax im
posed upon mixed flour.
A duty imposed upon mixed flour will distinguish
it from pure flour, and if there be a revenue stamp
affixed to every barrel, bag or package offered for
sale the public will be able to readily recognize the
sophisticated article when they see it. The tax im
posed, being only 4 cents a barrel, will not be bur
densome upon those who prefer the mixed flour, and
its permanent continuance, therefore, would- not be
unfair to any one.
It has been the claim of the mixed flour producers
that the product is just as healthful as pure wheat flour
and much more convenient for bread making, as well
as being in some respects more pleasing to the taste.
In the main the claim seems to be well justified, but
there are exceptions. Some of the adulterators of
wheat flour do not take the pains to make the adul
teration with mixtures that are strictly harmless.
When sophistication begins it does not always con
tinue in a state of innocence.
The Philadelphia Record says that among the adul
terants of flour used by dishonest dealers are flourine,
which is the refuse starch of glucose factories; min
eraline, a white clay or kaolin ground to powder;
barytes, a form of pulverized rock, and corn flour
made from maize. All of these, except the last named,
contain matter positively injurious to health, while
the ground clay and rock are, of course, absolutely
destitute of any life-sustaining qualities.
It is an open secret that many of the members of
Congress who voted for the imposition of this tax
along with others in the revenue bill did so as much
because of its effect as a pure food measure as for
the revenue it would raise. For a long time past the
manufacturers of pure flour have been striving to ob
tain some sort of national legislation tnat would pro
tect their interests against the adulterators. The
present tax tends in that direction and will help to
bring about a better, more direct and more compre
hensive pure food law hereafter.
It is to be regretted that the tax is not made even
more distinctive than it is. As it stands it confounds
all mixed flours into one class, making no distinction
between those which are healthful and those which
are not Moreover, it would have been well to im
pose a similar tax upon all adulterated foods, as well
as on mixed flour. The makers of bogus olive oil
and bogus fruit preserves ought to have been made
to pay their share of war taxes as well as the mixed
flour men. What has been done, however, is a step
In the right direction and as such it will be hailed
with satisfaction.
It would seem that the commander of the Astor
battery confounds his own identity with that of the-
Manila expedition. We violate no confidence in
saying that he is only a part of it, and that several
very estimable gentlemen will do their best to assist
him.
Another member of the Union Mission Army is
under arrest. The time seems to have arrived for
mustering that organization out of the service.

THE MIXED FLOUR TAX.
PARIS SALONS, 1898.
The Day of the Vernissage.
"U'htle America is absorbed in the Cuban
troubles the Parisians are entirely given
up for a day to their annual fete, the day
of the Vernissage, for it is no more per
mitted to miss this than the Grand Prix,
which occurs also this month.
The painters are reunited this year, but
it has not been without considerable
trouble. It has been necessary for the
bringing together of the brother enemies,
the two salons. Owing to the prepar
ations for the exposition of 1900 the two
buildings where the salons are usually
1 held, the one, the Palais d'lndustrie, was
demolished. The Palais dcs Beaux Arts
exists not; in this extreme peril the artists
are compromised and it was necessary to
make the concession.
As says an Arabian proverb, "Lea
hommes, sont dcs loups dans le bonheur
et dcs agneaux dans le malheur," painters
of all schools and all nationsâ all are of
the Champa dcs Effara and the Champs
Elyseesâ this year are united and exhib
iting their pictures and works of art un
der one roof, at the Galerie dcs Machines,
and it is anxiously hoped by many that
this commencement of a reconciliation
may be completed for 1900.
I come to visit the profound and for
midable salons in detail and am appalled
by the extent, and iind it ravishing in per
spective. But where to begin is a difficult
problem. One almost wishes for a lit
tle railroad to conduct him around at first
for a general view, so impossible does it
seem to get around amid the crowd of
people on Varnishing day; and such a
throng of unknown people there areâ the
artists themselves, their models, some
celebrities and nobility, then the fash
ionable dressed men and women who go
principally to exhibit their clothes, and
one haÂ£ enough to do on this day to study
the Parisian fashions without looking at
a single picture. When I tell you there
were in all 60,000 people on this the first
day it may give some idea of the difficul
ties of seeing much.
The Galerie dcs Machines is well chosen
for the salons. Enclosed in the center ia
a huge court, where the sculpture is ex
posed amid foliage and green grass, mak
ing- a fitting background. With the groups
of people, dressed in many and varied
colors, the picture is indeed attractive.
On the four sides are the salons leading
one into another, where the paintings
are exhibited. There are some 2000 oil
paintings in the section, Champs Elyseea
alone; but this number is smaller than
usual. This year on account of the con
solidation the committee found it neces
sary to reject a larger number than us
ual. Of the two sections it ia perhaps
difficult to say which is the better. Cer
tainly there are important and masterly
canvases in each. There are, aside from
the mural decorations and ambitious
compositions, of which I shall speak later,
some excellent portraits; one of M. Hono
taux, the French Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, by M. Benjamin Constantin. The
picture is masterly and perhaps the
strongest this artist has yet produced.
An equestrian portrait of Duke de Dou
deauvllle, by M. Aime Morot, is much
admired. The decorations by M. Puvis
de Cavainnes are wonderfully fine in com
position, thought, sentiment and feeling.
His Sainte Genevieve moves one with a
sense of beauty and great holiness and
holds one like a spell enraptured in front
of the work of this great master. The

THE LIES OF DIPLOMACY.

of Count Ignatieff how he came to be
nicknamed ; "The - Father of I Lies" while
Embassador at Constantinople, he, with a
low bow, responded, "In the service of

Count Mouravieff, the Minister . of â¢ For
eign Affairs at St. 1 ; Petersburg, is worthy
of the same nickname as Ignatieff. This
is shown |on the most | extraordinary I and

! large mural decoration by M. Raphel Col
lin for the Opera Comique is charming in
sentiment and color scheme. There are
three figures of women slightly, draped
in loose flowing robes, out in the open
air, and the charm of nature is felt most
strongly.
A portrait of Madame Rejane, the lead
ing French actress, by M. Besard, Is
much admired by the artists themselves
for the work of a conferee.
Very fine, also, are the canvases of M.
Raffallli and M. Carrieu. As usual. In
the section Champs dcs Mars, M. Dangan-
Bonnret Is perhaps most admired. M.
Heuner exposes two paintings this year
in his usually charming style, but the one
representing a dead woman, nude, with
her husband weeping over her, creates
great attention, and, in fact, is one of
the greatest paintings in this year's sa
lon. The death is admirably expressed
and the color scheme original and agree
able. In the figure of the man one can
feel the intense agony so strongly that I
the effect is appalling. There is a very j
admirable portrait of Mr. Gladstone, by
M. Hamilton.
As usual, our American painters are
well represented this year. Among those
already well known are F. A. Bridgman,
Frank Dv Mond and G. Inness Humbert.
Melchior H. O. Tanner, whose picture, it
will be remembered/was bought by the
French Government last year, has the
Ascension at the salon this year, and it
has already called forth much nattering
notice. Miss M. E. Dickson has two ex
cellent portraits. : Other Americans who
expose portraits are: Mr. Fred Marsh,
Mr. Frank A. Bicknell, Mr. Pepper and
H. M. Mott-Smith.
A portrait of Mr. Dickman of San Fran
cisco, by M. E. G. Coates, is well done.
Miss Eleanor B. McFarland of San
Francisco exhibits a portrait of her sis
ter; also a peasant interieur.
Among the statuary noticeable is the
Quadriga, in bronze, for Prospect Park, by
Mr. MacMonnlea. Also noticeably line is
the Shaw monument by M. St. Gaudens.
San Francisco artists are well repre
sented in Paris this winter. Miss Flor
ence- Lundbourg has been busy working
on a decoration all winter which has cre
ated much favorable notice. Miss Marion
Holden has a studio at 13 Rue Boissonard
and is busy working hard. She has only j
just returned from a short trip in Italy.
Mr. Martenez is one of the hardest work
ers over here and is studying under M. I
Gerome. Miss E. McFarland has had
great success with her work. Miss Mc-
Chesney is in Italy and intends spending
the summer working in Holland. Miss
Emelia Kallisher is in England, working
for the summer, and intends returning to
San Francisco in the autumn.. Her por
trait work is charming and shows that
she has studied with great care Velasque
and Mr. Whistler. Miss Jessie Allen is
studying under M. Raphel Collin and he is
much pleased with her progress. Miss

HOW STOCKTON WAS CINCHED.
The unenviable notoriety given the City-
Council of Stockton by the San Franciico
Call on account of the attempt to discredit
the product of the State rock crushing
establishment at Folsom will not be
relished very much by the council, but
the people of the city who have street
improvements to make and have paid
unnecessarily a high price for rock out
of private quarries will be inclined to
commend The Call. Those residents of
the city who have intelligently watched
the street improvements know that the
great difficulty with the macadamized
streets has not been in the quality of the
rock but in the manner of grading the
street, preparing the foundation ana
crowning or turnpiking the finished road
way. The fault has been primarily with
the specifications and secondarily in the
failure to live up to them in practice.
The roadways are too flat and do not turn
the rain. The first essential of every road,
whether of stone, gravel or dirt, is to
have it well crowned or rounded so that
no moisture will stand on the road. The
streets of Stockton might do in the Sou
dan, where there is not even a dew.â

THE TWINS IN THE TURRET.
First rifle-
Can you see her, oh, my brother?
Can you Bight her through the rack?
Is that streak across the smother
Coal smoke trailing from her stack?
Do you hear how, louder, clearer.
Sounds the throbbing of our screws?
When we come a little nearer
Which of us shall hail her? Choose.
Second rifle-
Let me send a brief opinion
Of the murders on the Maine;
Of the eagle's new dominion.
When we've closed accounts with Spain â
There, they've passed the word to crowd her,
Here's your squad, too, on the run.
Glad we've got this smokeless powder.
Now look out â you'll see the fun.
First rifle-
Are you ready, brother, ready,
With your thunderbolt of steel?
Have you got your bearings steady?
Gods! you made the whole world reel.
Now It's my turn; what, you hit her
In her vitals? Oh, what bliss!
There is naught in life as bitter
For a rifle as a miss.
Second rifle â
All hell's loose; there's no use talking.
That's the time you ripped her wide;
Look, there's Davy Jones a-walking,
Picking Spaniards from the tide.
Hi! but it's a howling racket
For a great, long silent gun!
Easy, now don't burst your Jacket,
Our death-dealing work Is done.

Deputy Collector Burt I. Thomas Appointed an Agent of
Internal Revenue.
Hector Burt M. Thomas received notification from Washington
rday that he had been appointed a special agent of the internal rev
e. It is understood that this appointment was made at the per
bi nal request of Collector John C. Lynch as a recognition of fhe long and
faithful service of Mr. Thomas on this coast, and the news was received
with joy by t - of the Deputy Collector, who regard it as a well
I lon.
Mr. Thomas will assume his duties as agent as soon as the arrival of
his commission, which is expected in a few days, and the supposition is that
he will be assigned to duty here for the present at any rate, and perhaps
permanently.
Nineteen years is Mr. Thomas' record in the service of the Treasury De
partment, and the appointment as agent is an indication that the depart
ment appreciates the conscientious work he has done for the Government.
He entered the service in November, IS7P, as a storekeeper at Cincinnati, 0.,
where he was retained for live years. In 18S4 he came to the coast as a
"Form 10 man.'" a special employe of the Government While here he has
occupied a number of different positions ln the department, and was made
a Deputy Collector f"iir y< When Oscar M. Welburn was suspended,
Mr. Thomas was the m^st available man to take up the duties, owing to
his familiarity with the workings of ail branches of the revenue service, and
a recommendation to the authorities at Washington resulted in his appoint
ment as acting Collector, which position he retained until J. C. Lynch was
made Collector.

THE JUDGMENT VACATED.
Decision Recently Founa Against the !
Harbor Commissioners Set
Aside.
A neat little trick conceived, according
to Judge Belcher, in the minds of the
attorneys representing the Harbor Com
missioners, in the action recently decided
against them in favor of the Paraftine
Paint Company and Samuel C. Irving-,
through which a reversal of the decision
of the Superior Court by the Supreme
Court was assured, was discovered yes
terday, and in consequence the judgment;
i against the Harbor Commissioners has
i been temporarily vacated. Contrary to
! the mode of procedure as prescribed by
j law, it was found that the judgment hau
been entered upon the records prior to
; the filing of the bill of findings. This
error in the record, if is stated by Judgo
; BHeher, would have constituted sufficient
grounds for reversal. "It is the duty of
I the plaintiff to prepare the bill of llml
'< ings, said Judgt Belcher. "There was no
1 hurry to sign and tile the bill of findings
i and if an appeal had been taken from the
i judgment as Mod a reversal would have
I resulted. The judgment has boen vacated,
however, and I have made an order that
I it shall not be filed until after the sign
| ing of the bill of findings, and the record
will thereby be straightened out."

Captains of lumber schooners who go
up river direct have been taking great

be a lumber craft missing with all on

City of Puebla docked.
The Harbor Commissioners opened bids
for the supply of lumber for six months
but finally came to the conclusion to re
ject the two that were put in and call
for new ones. Some time ago the E. K.
Wood Lumber Company offered to sup
ply lumber at $11 a thousand, but later
withdrew the same. Yesterday the Paci
fic Pine Lumber Company offered to sup
ply rough Oregon pine for $15 a thousand,
selected Oregon pine for $20 a thousand
and flooring for $25 per thousand feet,
while the S. E. Slade Lumber Company
offered to supply the same articles for
60 cents less per thousand.
Commissioner Colnon was opposed to
readvertlsing as nothing would be gained,
while Herold favored rejecting all the bids
on account of the E. K. Wood offer, llar
ney pointed out that the board had been
paying $14 GO a thousand right along and
that it would look as though they had
been paying too much If the lowest bid
THEY WILL TEA R UP NEPTUNE'S DEEP.
A Race for the Big Schooner Yachts From San Francisco
to Santa Cruz.
THE yachting event of the year Is
scheduled for July 2, and things will
hum on the ocean when the big crack
racing schooners leap to the waves
at the sound of the starting gun. The
Lurline, the Lady Mine, the Ramona, the
Frolic, the Nixie and the Aggie are the
yachts that will enter the race. It Is a
race for the swift, in which the element
of chance will be of some power.
The course is the broad ocean from this
city to Santa Cruz, and the starting point
outside the heads. For a long time there
has been a wealth of argument launched
as to which of these six fleet travelers
of the deep is the swiftest when the rac
ing gear is oiled and the decks cleared
for action. The owners are religious fol
lowers of the ocean sport and each one
Is of the opinion that he possesses a jewel
fairer than all the tribe. Many times
have the schooners been tested, but not
In several years has such an aggregation
of sea talent been brought together. The
owners of the yachts say that it will be
a mere pleasure cruise, nn opportunity to
get away for the Fourth to taste the de
lights of the ocean breeze and live in
Neptune's realm for a few fleeting hours.
But there is something more than this
in this meeting of the six above named
yachts. It will be a genuine ocean race
and several small bottles have been al
ready wagered on the result.
The weather conditions will be a great
factor in the race. The Lurline, the Lady
Mine and the Ramona are craft that
fairly gloat over a stiff breeze and a good
sea. Their lighter brethren, the Frolic,
the Nixie aÂ«d the Aggie, do not behave
bo well in heavy weather, but they show
to better advantage in the ordinary bay
winds. No matter what the day brings
forth in the way of winds and swells the
: race will be one in which the Ingenuity
of the skipper will be called into use. A
palm of victory will go to the winner and
this race, which is parading under the
name of cruise, will become historic and
lmd a place in the annals of San Fran
cisco yachting.
were rejected. After looking over the j
price lists of the various companies ln j
the business, the board decided to reject
the bids.
The board decided to allow nickel-in
the-slot telephones and weighing ma
chines to be placed in the new ferry
depot by Louis Glass on the payment of
$50 a month. No other nickel-in-the-slot
device will be allowed in the building.
George Smith, a peddler, and Fred
Lewis, a teamster, were arrested on East |
street yesterday by Officer McGrath after i
a long chase. They drove along In a '
wagon and picked up ten boxes of to
bacco from in front of Wellman, Peck & ;
Co's store. No one paid any attention
to them, and they would have got away
with their prize had not Officer McGrath
showed up on the scene and given chase.
The men were locked up in the Harbor
Police Station on a charge of grand lar- !
ceny. Both of them professed entire ig
norance as to how the tobacco came to
be in their wagon.
Plasterers Organized.
A meeting of plasterers was held at 10S5
Market street last night and permanent
organization secured. The trade was well
represented, and the majority of the

NUPTIALS OF MISS GUNDLACH AND BEN WEED.
The Popular Principal of the Sonoma High School Joins the Ranks of
the Benedicts.
The wedding of Benjamin Weed and Miss Eva Carola Gundlach was solemnized last evening at the residence
of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Bundschu, 245 Chestnut street. The bride is the daughter of the late pioneer viticulturist
of 'â¢Rhinefarm." Sonoma, and sister of Mrs. Charles Bundschu.
The groom, who is the only son of Dr. G. A. Weed of Berkeley, is a young man of rare literary attain
ments and a graduate of Berkeley, where he inaugurated the place for exercises now known there as "Ben Weed's
Amphitheater," with the representation of the "Vehmgericht." He holds the position of principal of the high school
of Sonoma, where his energy and classical propensities brought out a few years ago the production of the "Mer
chant of Venice" and the Grecian tragedy, "Oedipus Tyrannus," produced by the scholars at their closing exer
cises in grand style. He Is the originator and composer of the "Bacchus Vintage Festivals" so successfully pre
sented in the valleys near Sonoma during the past vintages. Miss Gundlach isahighly accomplished pianist, a pupil of
Hartmann, and a young lady of rare social attainments.
Rev. Dr. Hatch of Berkeley performed the ceremony that made the fortunate young couple one.
The bride was attended by Miss Mabel Weed, Miss Inez Strauck, Miss Louise Bundschu and Miss Lina Frauen
holz.
Maury Sims was best man and Henry R. Gundlach, Jesse D. Burks and G. M. Wilder officiated as ushers.
The bride wore a pretty gown of white organdie over white silk. The veil was confined to the coiffure by a
wreath of orange blossoms.
About eighty people joined the restive board after the ceremony, and many eood wishes were expressed in
toast and song toward the happiness and prosperity of the bridal couple. Mr. and Mrs. Ben Weed will spend thuir
honeymoon in the Santa Cruz mountains and Monterey.
Among the many lovely and valuable wedding presents was a beautiful silver tray, bearing the inscription:
"Presented to Benjamin Weed in. loving acknowledgment by his pupils of the Sonoma Valley Union High School."

NOTORIOUS ST. MAEY'S STREET.
The Alcalde Company Secures the
Property for Purposes Yet
Unknown.
Three significant deeds were placed on
record yesterday by the Alcalde Market
Company, a corporation which has been
trying to get possession of the southern
end of St. Mary's street, a small alley
running from California to Pine street,
between Kearny and Dupont.
The deeds are from Mary Kelly to the
Alcalde Company, from Mary Kelly to
Jonathan White and from Jonathan
White to the Alcalde company. The
property deeded by Jonathan White and
Mrs. Kelly to the Market Company is
Identical, both he and Mary Kelly deed
ing a half interest. The deed from Mary
Kelly to Jonathan White includes a half
interest in a flfty-vara lot commencing in
the middle of the block on Pine street,
between Kearny and Dupont streets, and
which contains that portion of St. Mary's
street to which the Market Company has
long endeavored to gain title. All three
deeds were made in January last, but not
recorded.
Borne time ago the story of the incorpo
ration of the Alcalde Market Company
was made public, and at that time it was
stated the object for which the com
pany was formed was to secure posses
sion of St. Mary's street, from which all
the immoral characters who had for
years infested it had been driven by the
Board of Supervisors. The street does
not appear on the old maps of the city,
and tne claim of the company will prob
ably be that the street never had been a
public thoroughfare, and so belongs to
those parties who owned the surrounding
property when the street was cut
through. If it is a public street the Su
pervisors have control, but it would be
a difficult matter to manage It were the
street declared closed and revert to pri
vate hands.
For this reason the report that the Al
calde Company was formed for the pur
pose of getting possession of the street
was the cause of a great deal of com
ment.
"What use the new proprietors may
make of the property remains to be seen,
and their next movement will be watched
by the general public with particular in
terest.
THE UNION ENTERTAINS.
Visit of the Grand Officers to Califor-
ma Council in Elks' Hall
Last Night.
The visit of the S t an Francisco Cabinet
of the National Union to California
Council in Elks' Hall last night was
one of tho most interesting events
in the history of that branch of the order.
In addition to the visiting officers there
was a large number of the membership
and visitors from other councils of this
city and those across the bay, besides a
representation of the boys in blue who
are members of the order.
At the close of the business the mem
bers of the order partook of a banquet,
nearly 200 occupying seats at the table.
Charles J. King, recording secretary of
the council, acted as toastmaster, and
toasts were responded to as follows: "The
National Union and Its Work," President
J. H. Hastings; "The Volunteers in the
United States Army," C. A. Steel of the
Thirteenth Minnesota Regiment; "Sister
Councils," N. R. Arter, president of
Golden Gate Council; "The Fraternal
Features of the National Union," J. E.
Field. There were a number of others
who responded, and in addition there was
a programme which included vocal music
by the council's quartet, imitations of
Chinese and the arrival of a freight
train by Mr. Nugent of Berkeley, vocal
solo by Mr. Ker, amusing stories by J.
Semeria and other numbers. The singing
of "The Star Spangled Banner" by the
quartet, and the audience joining in the
chorus, was a fine feature of the evening,
which was one of fraternity and patriot
ism.
WIDBER PLEADS NOT GUILTY.
Judge Carroll Cook Refuses to Dis
miss the Indictments Against
Him.
A. C. Widber, the defaulting City Treas
urer, was before Judge Cook yesterday to
plead to the four indictments against him
charging him with felony embezzlement.
When proceedings were opened Judge
Cook denied the motion of the defendant
to set aside the indictments on the alle
gation that the grand juries which con
sidered the case of the defaulter were
prejudiced against him. Wiaber entered
a plea of not guilty in each case. On mo
tion of the defense it was agreed to have
the cases go on the calendar on August 15,
to be set for trial. When Widber was ar
rested he stated that he would plead
guilty to embezzlement, but yesterday's
proceedings proved that he has changed
his mind since that time and will make a
hard fight for his liberty.

THE ELECTION LAW.
Judge Joachimsen Dismisses the
Charge of Illegal Voting Against
Matthew W. Driscoll.
Frank Gould, one of "the tailors of
Tooley street," and Registrar Biggy grot
a setback in Judge Joachimsen's court
yesterday which caused no end of amuse
ment to the people in the courtroom.
Matthew W. Driscoll, who was arrest
ed for Illegal voting at the First Pre
cinct of the Twenty-eighth District at
the charter election, appeared for his
preliminary examination.
Gould appeared as special prosecutor,
and was coached by the Registrar. It
was shown that Lieutenant Anderson of
the Potrero had voted in the same pre
cinct under the same circumstances as
Driscoll, but the Registrar did not find it
incumbent upon him to cause the arrest
of th<? lieutenant, who frankly testified
that he had told Driscoll that he had
voted, although he had not resided In
the precinct within thirty days prior to
the election, believing that it was not
necessary.
Other evidence was given that Driscoll
had been advised to the effect that he
had not lost his residence, although he
had gone to Los Angeles to pick fruit,
and was entitled as a voter to record his
vote.
Gould insisted upon the case being de-
cided upon the law and the facts, but the
Judge retorted that he did not see why
fish should be made of one and flesh of
the other. In other words, that it looked
to him like persecution to arrest Driscoll
on a felony charge when no felonious
intent had been proved, and take no ac
tion against Lieutenant Anderson. He
dismissed the case.
Red snow, which is sometimes seen, is
due to the presence of a minute form of
plant life which secretes a red coloring
matter.

THE ILLS OF WOMEN
And How Mrs. Pinkham Helps
Overcome Them.
Mrs. Mary Bollixger, 1101 Marianna
St., Chicago, 111., to Mrs. Pinkham:
"I have been troubled for the past
two years with falling- of the womb,
leucorrhcea, pains over my body, sick
headaches, backache, nervousness and
weakness. I tried doctors and various
remedies without relief. After taking"
two bottles of your Vegetable Com-
pound, the relief I obtained was truly
wonderful. I have now taken several
more bottles of your famous medicine,
and can say that I am entirely cured."
Mrs. Henry Dorr, No. 806 Findley St. ,
Cincinnati, Ohio, to Mrs. Pinkham :
"For a long time I suffered with
chronic inflammation of the womb,
pain in abdomen and bearing-down
feeling. Was very nervous at times, and
so weak I was hardly able to do any-
thing. Was subject to headaches, also
troubled with leucorrhcea. After doc-
toring for many months with different
physicians, and getting no relief , I had
given up all hope of being well
again when I read of the great good
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound was doing. I decided immedi-
ately to give it a trial. The result was
simply past belief. After taking four
bottles of Vegetable Compound and
using three packages of Sanative Wash.
I can say I feel like a new woman, I
deem it my duty to announce the fact
to my fellow sufferers that Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable remedies have
entirely cured me of all my pains and
suffering. I have her alone to thank
for my recovery, for which I am grate-
ful. May heaven bless her for the
good work she is doing for our sex."

EASTERN MARKETS.
KEW YORK; STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 21.â The stock market to
day gave renewed evidence of the general dis
position among important financial Interests to
restrict confident operations until developments
in the war situation, more stability to the grain
market and a clearer perception to the future
of the money market materialize. The an-
nouncement of the Baltimore and Ohio reorgan
ization plan, which involves the distribution of
new securities in excess of $200,000,000 and the
formation of an underwriting syndicate to pro
vide $80,000,000 cash to carry out the immediate
provisions of the plan, augurs well for the
confidence of its projectors in the immediate
tendency of the money market. Preparations
looking to the disbursements of enormous sums
In -connection with the July dividend and inter
est payments are now being made. The general
temper of speculation to-day was hesitating
dunes the greater part of the forenoon owing
to the' vigorous efforts of the bears to precipi
tate weakness in the general market by con
centrating their efforts against the' high-priced
specialties with a view of dislodging long stock.
These efforts were rewarded by substantial de-
. clines in Sugar, People's Gas and Metropolitan
Street Railway. The granger group yielded
sympathetically with the break 4>i wheat, but
the remainder of the list was well supported
and losses were small.
ThÂ« rerertshness of the leaders dominated the
speculation to a more or less extent until a dis- !
m on the part of the London operators
to absorb a sprinkling of the international
favorites, coupled with manifest support to the
standard shares at succeeding levels, served to
Check the reactionary tendency, and values
moved slowly upward with the ultlmute result*
Of the .lay's operations showing slight frac- j
tional changes favoring either si.le
The bond market wag fairly active, but ex- 1
hlbited Irrngularlty. Some individual tran- ;
eactions of note were made, including a block j
of $200,000 Union Pacitic 4s at 97. The total
saios were $2,230,000.
. 'Quotations for Government securities were
unchanged on call except an improvement of
J /4 per cent in the old 4s registered.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 154.8Q0
t shares, including-: Baltimore and Ohio, 3100;
Burlington, 12.950; Louisville" and Nashville.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 21.â There were several
causes which combined to give Wheat strength
at the start: the cables were decidedly strong,
Liverpool prices ranging from l%d to 2%d per
bushel higher, with the continent markets bet
ter. Another reason for strength was found in
the bad news from France, where the crop
was said to have been seriously hurt by. rust.
According to authentic reports the yield there
will be 10 to 20 per cent less than anticipated.
Advices were also received from many sections
In Missouri. Kansas and Texas, where the grain
is ripe, reporting serious loss from rains and
those, too, had a good influence early in the
day. Shorts covered freely and there was some
general buying for the long account, under
which prices advanced sharply. The heavy
profit-taking and short selling which followed
this led to a sharp reaction and September,
which started at 6S^c to 6S%c, fell off to 66%Â«
tK%e and July, which started at 73<'g73%c, de
clined to 71% c. ..December lost l%c. In the
last half of the session the market turned
strong on the confirmation of tne deal to pool
the Pillsbury and Peavy Wheat along with I
the Letter holdings and to have Armour I
handle it all had been consummated. Together
with this came still further claims of crop
damage from St. Louis. This bullish news
brought the shorts out In force and the decline
was more than recovered. July closed with an
advance of 2Vi<&2'v â¢ and September lViil^c.
After a strong opening In Corn the market
' became quite weak, due to profit-taking.
Later the loss was barely recovered on the
final rally in Wheat. July closed %c lower.
Oats followed Corn, July closing with a loss
of Ko.
The appearance of two new cases of yellow
fever, in Mississippi, together with the break
in Corn, depressed Provisions. Pork lost 15c,
Lard 5c and. Ribs 7%c.iWHM(

THE STOCK MARKET.
An assessment of IB cents on Confidence was
the only thing new in mining stocks, which
were excessively dull at easy prices.
Local securities were dull, with a further de
cline in Oceanic Steamship.
In the Chollar mine during the past week
they placed three sets of timbers in the main
incline above the 1200-foot level station. They
are making good progress with the repairs to
the main north drift on the 100-foot level. The
upraise from the west crosscut on the tunnel
level and 60 feet north from the south line
has been advanced during the week 7 feet, and
is now up 42 feet. The top shows old fillings
and some fair grade ore, which is being saved.
Have shipped to the Nevada mill 7 tons of ore,
the car samples of which assayed as follows:
Gold, $S 12: silver, 12.15 ounces per ton. Have
milled during the week 107 tons and 750 pounds
of ore which had accumulated at the mill. The
average battery assay of this ore was $16 53 in
gold and 11.42 ounces of silver per ton. Have
shipped to the assay office 6S l i pounds of crude
bullion. On the Brunswick lode, at shaft No.
1, on the 800-foot level, the Joint main south
drift has been advanced during the week 23
feet, making its total length 56 feet from the
station. The face is in porphyry.
In the Potosi mine the west crosscut on the
south line, tunnel level, has been advanced for
the week 25 feet, and is now out 156 feet. The
face shows porphyry and low grade quartz.
During the week they have been placing square
sets on the streak of orÂ« mentioned in the last
official report, 40 feet below the surface. Have
shipped to the Nevada mill 19 tons and 600
pounds of ore averaging by wagon sample as
say, gold $15 01 and silver 14.58 ounces per ton.
On the Brunswick lode, at shaft No. 1, on
the 600-foot level, the main south drift was
advanced during the week 7 feet, and is now
out from the north line 405 feet. The face is
in porphyry. Have discontinued work in this
drift and at a point In the drift 450 feet south
from the north line, or 150 feet south from
crosscuts No. 2. east and west, have started
east and west crosscuts No. 3. The east cross
cut has been advanced 16 feet; face in por
phyry. The west crosscut has been advanced
20 "feet. The face Is in porphyry. The main
Joint south drift from the 800-foot level station
has been advanced during the week 23 feet and
is now out from the station 56 feet. The face
is in porphyry.

A NOVEL TROOP SHIP.
Representative Kerr of Ohio has In
troduced %t the Navy Department F. A.
Knapp of Ottawa, an inventor of the
roller-boat, whose fame for his ingeni
ous and apparently practical method
of navigating the water is not confined
to the Dominion of Panada. Mr. Knapp
has come to Washington to send â  a
naval expert to Canada and inspect the
large roller-boat which he is now ope
rating successfully in Toronto harbor.
Mr. Kna< p claims that he can build a
roller-boi t 200 feet high in three
months v.hich would be an ideal troop
ship. He would have it capable of car
rying 30,000 men, and asserts that it
would be ; much faster than the ships
that now. travel the ocean.
Mr. Knkpp said of his proposed boat
yesterday: "Drawing little water, such
a boat Could get close inshore, and
would not need to enter any particular
port, but could land troops at any point
on the shores of Cuba, The boat, too,
would carry 60,000 tc.-ns of freight, and
could be used as a coal boat. With
60,000 tons of <_oal on board the roller
boat would be a moving coal station
for the fleet. Both ends of the boat
could be armed with guns so that an
enemy could not capture it."âWashing

FIGHT OVER A SCHOOL SITE
WISHES OF A MASS - MEETING
DISREGARDED.
ILocal Improvement Club Takes a
Hand â Outgoing Officials May
Not Spend ths
Money.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, June 21.
A temporary injunction was granted this
: to William a taxpayer
of Fruitvale, to restrain the trustees of
l^ray school district from purchasing a
â  , erecting a building and fur
g it.
Bray district is very much wrought up
over the erection of a new school. Sev
eral sites have been considered and some
favor one while others favor another. '
There was ;ui election of school trustees !
two weeks ue<> and the issue was the
v. hich should be purchased. Real
estate dealers especially, and the mass
â¢ zens generally, took a hand in the I
discussion.
. Last night a mass meeting was held In
Bray school, and the matter was warmly
discussed. The meeting was called by the
local improvement club, and a majority i
of all the voters in the district attended. ;
A vote was taken and it was decided by
the meeting that no lot for a school site
should be purchased until after July 5. !
This was done for the purpose of prevent- ,
Ing the board now in office from expend- !
ing a large sum of money on improve- i
ments that will be erected under the su- !
pervision of the new board recently elect- i
cd. The sense of the meeting was that !
the new school board should have entire j
ge of the new school project.
After the mass meeting, two of the old
V.ffiia of directors met and decided to pro- !
ceed at once to spend the money and buy
the site. As this was in direct opposition \
to the spirit of the nie<-tii;g there was
another outburst of opposition. To-day
both factions came to Oakland for legal |
advice. The trustees are trying to carry j
out their plan to purchase a site, and let !
the contracts for building and furnishing j
the school before they retire, and their \
opponents have determined to block the *
scheme if possible.
The opponents scored a temporary vic
tory to-day. They set forth in their peti
tion for an injunction that there are five
offers of land, and that the site offered by
A. E. P-ruguiere will probably be bought
by the trustees and that it is not for the
best iriterests of the district.

OAKLAND, June 21.â The announce

OAKLAND. Juno 21.â The day in the '

RAILROAD CROSSING.
Franchise to Put One on Webster
Street Near the Estuary.
ALAMEDA, June 21.â At the meeting:
of the Board of City Trustees last even-
Ing an ordinance was passed granting
the South Pacific Coast Railroad per
mission to put a single or double track

ary. The approaches to the crossing
must be graded and macadamized, with
not to exceed 2 per cent grade, and gates
must fie put In and a flagman maintained.
These gates must be lowered Immediate

Immediately after a train passes. Be
sides this the Pacific Improvement Com

land across the marsh sufficient to widen
V.'ebster street to eighty feet. The fran
chise is to 'last twenty-five years.
WATER WAR
IS PROBABLE
New Rates Become Law
in Nine Days.
COMPANIES AGAIN FIGHTING
NOT UNANIMOUS IN REGARD TO
THE HIGH RATE.
Neither Will Say That It Intends to
Take Full Advantage of
the Woodward
Ordinance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, June 21.
In nine days more the people of Oak- !
land will know if the rival water com- I
panics will charge the extortionate rates
fixed at their request by the City Coun
cil last February. Already there is more |
than a rumor that the high rates will not !
be changed. Nor is there any reason why j
they should be.
After the jiew rates were fixed by the
Council the water companies came to
gether and decided to charge all that they
could under the ordinance passed last
yÂ«ar.
They had previously been cutting the
rates to a great extent and la the case ;
of the County Jail, with an average of
sixty people, the water was supplied at
50 cents a month. Similar low rates were
charged and yet the companies testified
before the Council that they were charg
ing on an average two-thirds of what the
ordinance permitted. Since March 1 they ''
charged full rates to all and the increase :
has been so great that it is now shown
they were not charging more than one- j
third the legal rate, 'ihe rates are now !
so high that, according to the figures sub- i
mitted by the companies last February, ,
the income must now be very generous.
The ordinance authorizes the collection !
of water rates in advance, so the bills !
for July will tell the tale. The bill for
water used in the public, square has al
ready been increased about 600 per cent j
since the companies charged all they were i
Permitted to under the ordinance that |
will expire June 30.
Neither of the companies will say j
whether they intend to make out their |
July bills according to the new schedule, i
but it is known that there is a disagree- i
ment between them. On January' 1 of :
this year the two companies agreed to do I
no more cutting, but now that the fiscal
year is closirig there is every evidence
of another rate war.
DEMAND MORE TRAINMEN.
Indignant Residents of Golden Gate
Appeal to the City Council
for Relief.
OAKLAND, June 21.â The following
self-explanatory petition was presented
to the City Council last night, signed by
over two hundred persons. It was re
ferred to the Street Railroad Committee:
To-the Honorable the City Counc.il of the City
of Oakland â Gentlemen: We, the undersigned
citizens and taxpayers, most respectfully peti
tion your honorable body, before there is any
more sacrifice of life and limbs of persons
traveling over the Berkeley branch railroad of
the Central Pacific Railroad Company:
Firstâ That they be compelled to have two
brakemen on the ground, one at each side of
the train, on the arrival and departure of
same.
Second â That at least two gates shall be
opened on each side of the train, both on ar
rival and departure at such station known as
Golden Gate, where the road runs near the
center of the town, with the majority living
on the south side of the railroad, and not force
the passengers on the easterly-bound trains to
alight from the left side of the train Instead of
the right side, where the greater number of
people live: thereby being forced to cross the
railroad track, uselessly endangering their
livps by reason of the railroad company not
employing sufficient help to properly see the
boarding and alighting passengers. At present
a. conductor and brakeman have to run a. train
of from three to eight and even more oars, so
they cannot possibly attend to thelrÂ»dutles
properly; such negligence resulting in tne kill-
Ing or maiming of Borne unfortunate passenger,
and no one sees it.
The gates now used are only to the detriment
of the traveling public, in order to force every
one to alight on one side that the company will
not have to employ the proper amount of help,
and any one being close pressed for time, by
having all the gates closed, misses the train.
Thirdâ The blowing oft of steam at the sta
tion Is a nuisance and has caused many hair
breadth escapes to life and limb and should be
avoided, and any one on being pressed for
time, seeing all the gates closed, takes chances
in order not to miss his connections, which
he would not be compelled to do were gates
open on both sides of the train.
Y.'herefore your petitioners pray that the said
company be compelled to employ sufficient help
to man the trains, and that at least two gates
be open on the south side of all trains upon
arriving at the etations on said line, In order
to insure the safety of the public.
FOUND DROWNED.
The Body of George M. Baker Picked
TJp in the Bay Tuesday Horning.
ALAMEDA, June 21.â D. Doyle, a street
sweeper, found a body on the beach at

suit, while the one found is dressed In
black.

remains were those of George M. Baker,
who appears to have lived in a. number Of
places.

The Market Character
ized by Dullness.
FEW LARGE SALES MADE

NUMBER OF MORTGAGES.
A General Review of the Records,
New Building Contracts,
Sales and Realty
Notes.
Progress in the "world of realty"
seems to be marked with uncertainty and
threatened by another period of business
stagnation. The general character of the
market for the past week has been one of
extreme dullness, few sales meriting more
than passing comment having been nego
tiated by the large firms that, control the
stream of progression. The building rec
ord, although slightly better than that
of the preceding week, can boast of noth
ing In the way of awards of large or un
usual contracts.
Although real estate is at a low ebb the
number of mortgages seems to have
grown larger In proportion as the value
of property has depreciated, and each
week records a list of many "exceeding
the $20,CKK) limit and a few attaining thai
of the $50,000.

A gentleman, whose business is a constant strain upon
his nerves, relates that one night recently he was unabie
to sleep. On previous occasions he had observed a bene-
fit arising from the use of Ripans Tabules. On this
particular occasion, believing that heroic measures were
necessary, he took three. The result was really surpris-
ing. The effect was as quieting as though the medicine
Lad contained a narcotic, which every one knows it does
not There was an immediate feeling of ease, rest and
quiet, extending in a few minutes over the entire system,
and sleep came as naturally as to a child

ordinance and found guilty. He was fined
and Imprisoned. Yesterday he applied to
the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas
corpus, setting up that the ordinance is
Illegal, as it conflicts with the constitu
tion of the State. The writ was granted
and the case will lie tried on its merits.
THE DRUIDS.
Session of the Grand Grove of the
Jurisdiction of Californiaâ State
of the Order.
The thirty-fourth annual session of the
Grand Grove of California, United An
cient Order of Druids, was opened yester
day in Druid's Hall on Sutter street.
The following grand officers were pres
ent: H. J. Goller, N. G. A.; Frank Lewis,
D. X. G. A.; John M. Graves, G. S.; E. 11.
Goetz. G. T.; J. A. Devoto, P. N. G. A.; A.
Olma, G. M.; J. Neffziger, G. G.; D. An
tonovich, G. Sent.; E. L. Wagner, G. W.
Lovie, grand representatives; F. Cavag
naro, G. H. Bertram and J. C. Bernstein, :
alternates; J. Nickels, Henry A. Chase j
and L. Chassaque, grand trustees. There j
were present at roll call 112 delegates, rep
resenting 54 groves. Subsequently addi- â 
tional representatives appeared and were
seated.
The reports of the several grand officers
were presented. In his report the noble
grand arch ?ays:
"While the increase of members in our;
or.der during the past year may not have
reached our expectations, still I feel Justi- ]
fied in saying it was not caused through
lack of interest on the part of myself or
the grand officers who were always will
ing and ready to assist me on any and all
occasions, iiiid I feel deeply grateful to
them for their kindness. The reports from
the vurious groves the first six months
were very encouraging, but drought and
frosts this spring caused great loss to the
farmers and orchardists, throwing many
out of employment and consequently the
suspension list in the various interior
groves were larger than they would have
been under ordinary circumstances."
The report of Secretary Graves shows
a total membership of 3815, with a net
gain during the year of 206. Two new
groves were instituted, one surrendered its
charter, and the number now is 70. The
amount expended in relief was $24,632.
A telegram of congratulations was re
ceived from Supreme Arch Shaffnltt of St.
Louis, and an answer was sent by the
noble grand arch.
. The report of the committee on laws
and subordinates was adopted.
The officers and delegates accepted an
invitation to attend a banquet and ball to
be given in California Hall to-night.
J. J. Mollison. Henry A. Chase and E. H.
Goetze were appointed the press commit
tee.
Officers will be elected to-morrow. F.
Lewis will be promoted noble grand arch.
For the office of Deputy L. G. Schord.
Henry Lange. James Hogan. D. Antono
vich and J. F. Martinoni will be candi
dates. There may be thr^e candidates for
the office of grand secretary, and for
grand marshal the only one named is A.
B. Treadwell.

TROTTERS AT OAKLAND.
Horsemen and Their Strings Give
Promise of a Great Meeting.
The outlook for a most successful meet
ing of the Pacific Coast Trotting Horse
Breeders' Association, which opens at the
Oakland racetrack next Saturday, be
comes better each day. Horsemen are
arriving daily and the growing interest
is manifested by the number of railbirds
that are seen on the fences in the early
hours. Yesterday there were at least 200
of those, indefatigable workers getting a
line on the horses. The track is not fast
just now as It has been kept in not too
hard a condition for working, but it will
be in tip-top shape next Saturday if
"Julian Bill" Fleldwick's efforts will make
It so.
Among the horsemen with strings at
the track were noticed John Phippen, Sam
Hoy, Det Bigelow, C. E. Clarke, C. A.
Owens, William Baker and Walter Maben.
J. M. Nelson has only four in his string
at the trackâ Baywood 2:10, Hijo del Di
ablo 2:ll l /Â£, and a fast colt, 3 years old,
called I Direct, by Direct.
J. W. Gordon has the fast pacer F W
2:12i4, by Dorsey's Nephew, who should
do 2:OS or better this year.
Bunch of San Jose has Ethel Downs
2:10, Boodle 2:12^, Thompson 2:15, Iran
Alto 2:19^ and Dr. Frasse 2:29%, all look
ing and going well. The stallion Boodle
is entered in the 2:13 classes and the free
for-alls, and should never be behind the
money.
Pete Williams has Monterey 2:13%. and
five others. Monterey is a little footsore
from working on a hard track at Ala
meda, but reeled off a mile in 2:20 very
easily.
James Sullivan has a big string of four
teen, including Mamie Griffin 2:12%. Maud
P 2:26^, Our Jack 2:17%. Arldison 2:lBV>,
Dr. J 2:21%, Prince Ansel 2:20%, Lottie 2:25,
and the pacers Fitz Lee. 2:i: j .Vi, Majella,
Don and Captain Hackett.
The Los Angeles contingent was In
creased this week also by the arrival of
C A. Winship. John Baker and W. Dur
fee. In Winship's string is Agitator.
All are loud in their praise of the qual
ity of the hay which can be b.ought in
any quantity and at the reasonable figure,
considering early misgivings in the spring,
of $23 per ton.
Horsemen will be able to get their
badges at the secretary's office at the
Oakland racetrack on Friday morning at
11 o'clock.

The Contempt Stands.
Alfred Overend, the prosecuting witness
in the criminal case against Minnie
Campbell, cannot obtain any relief from
the Supreme Court. When the case was
on hearing before Superior Judge Wal
lace the witness refused to answer the
questions asked on the ground that hi*
answers would incriminate him. The
Judge concluded that the man was trifling
with the court and Overend was adjudged
guilty of contempt of court on several oc
casions until his fims for contempt
amounted to $1500 and imprisonment.
Overend endeavored to escape by means
of a writ of habeas corpus, but" the Su
preme Court on learning the facts de
nied the petition.

WISHES HE
HAD NEVER
COME BACK
A Husband Received |
With Deep Regret.
LIFE ONE LONG QUARREL
SOME OF THE TROUBLES OF MR.
AND MRS. H. DE L. PIKE.
Deeply Mourned When Lost, but
Received With New Hostilities
and a Warrant When
Found.
When the husband of Mrs. Henrietta
Pike mysteriously disappeared from his
home a month ago the lady was much
disturbed and took measures to find
her missing spouse. Her efforts were
successful, but the fact that she had
him arrested yesterday afternoon on
the charge of threatening: her life leads
to the belief that she regrets that he re
turned, and wishes she had told him
she didn't care if he never came back.
Harrison de Silva Pike is a book
keeper for the Jumper Mining Com
pany and lives with his wife at 1006
Sacramento street. On the morning of
May :S he left home after a quarrel
v. ith Mrs. Pike and was seen no more
for nearly a month. The wife was
greatly worried at the disappearance of
2<lr. Pike and notified the police. Her
fear that he had done away with him
self or enlisted in the army was dis
pelled by his suddenly making his ap
1" arance at the house a few days ago.
The quarrel which caused the separa
tion was evidently continued, as yes
terday Mrs. Pike swore out a warrant
charging her prodigal husband with
threats against iife. Officers Walsh
and Crowley arrested Mr. Pike late in
the afternoon and placed him behind
the bars at the California-street sta
tion.
Pike is a -well -educated man, and has '
been the holder of a number of good i
positions. At one time he was assist- !
am general manager of the Denver and !
Rio Grande Railroad, and at another |
chief clerk for the Union Pacific Rail- !
way. with headquarters at Omaha. He '
has held his present position with the
mining company for nearly two years.
Marriage has evidently been a failure !
with Mr. and Mrs. Pike, as this Is the
second time they have appeared in i
court with the lady as complaining j
witness. Last February Mr. Pike was j
arrested for battery on charges pre- J
ferred by his wife. She asserted that i
he had beaten and choked her and then ]
put her out of dour? in the rain. The
case never came to trial, as Mrs. Pike
withdrew the charge. Mrs. Pike is row
supporting herself and a littie adopted
child by taking in boarders. She corn
that he contributes nothing to
lvr support, not even paying her for
liis board and lodging* Neither of the
I would talk of the immediate
ca.use of the trouble which resulted in
the arrest of Mr. Pike, but parties in i
the house say that he has abused his
Wife since his return and threatened to
kill her.
When locked up last evening Mr.
Pike was firm in his assertion thst
there was absolutely no reason fur his
being attested, and that it was a c'.e-ir I
case of persecution. He stated that h a !
was of the opinion that his wife d*?ir?<i
to bring him Into discredit with hie
employers so that he would lose im
position.
SOMETHING UNIQUE
IN TELEPHONES
AN AUTOMATIC "HELLO THAT
WILL BE WELCOMED.
The Call Is Made Mechanically and
No Time 13 Wasted in Shout
ing at the Machine.
No more shall we hoar the soft voice of
the "hello" girl or the plaintive sound of
the phonograph sweetly murmuring "Call
again, line's busy"; no more shall good
citizens swear under their I>re;nh at the
delays and mistakes of the present sys
tem, for a new era in telephones may
soon dawn upon a lons-suffering public.
If the automatic telephone Invented by
William F. Smith, the well-known archi
tect, is put in uso in this city all this
â will come to pass.
The labor of six long years was exhibit
ed at 202 Sansome street yesterday, and
should the machine give as much satis
faction in actual use as it does experi
mentally the inventor's work will be
crowned with success.
The telephone is the same as now used on
present systems, only having a plate on lower
box, or In case of hand telephones on stand
ard, fitted with eleven buttons, and a proving
wot to chow you have called up the right num
ber.. These buttons are numbered from 1 to 0
Inclusive, and one Dls. or disconnecting button
end are pushed down a short space In slots. To
call up a number, the buttons are pushed down
In rotation to make up that number. For in
stance, your number 13 3576. you wish to call
up 18,3. Push down button marked 1 to bottom
of slot, and let go; it immediately files back.
Push down button S. let go. then button 7, let
go, then button 3; immediately in front at prov
ing slot, shows 1573, and at central station, In
a similar slot on twitch-board, will appear the
same Dumber, under 3576, the number of your
telephone, and your telephone is immediately
connected with the one desired. When
conversation Is ended you hang- up the
receiver, push down disconnecting but
ton, when all lumbers disappear, the connect
ing plug- is thrown out, and any number you
may desire to ring: up can be gotten Immedi
ately, without waiting for central office; often,
at present, ten minutes or more. Should it
happen the number you wish Is busy the
operator at central switches on the phono
graph, and so informs you. If you wish to
wait, leave the telephone, and the number be
ing exposed, shows operator you are waiting
and you will be plugged in and connected as
Boon as the line Is clear. Should .you prefer
tÂ« ring up another number, push down dis
connecting number and r>rooeed as before One
can readily tee the subscriber is In an inde
pendent position in regard to calling- and dis
connecting, and the operator, who simply puts
In plugs, can do Infinitely more work
The new system, if adopted, will do
away with half the number of girls now
employed by the local company, one girl
being able to answer many hundred more
calls than at present
A corporation ha " boen formed to handle
the Invention, consisting of the following
officers: James M. Allen, president; Wil
liam F. Russell, vice-prestaent, and Wll-
I! . am , F,-^F ,-^ S! . nlt !* secretary. It is the
stockholders intention to c-lve the
people of this city the first op
portunity to show their approval
of the new 'phone. If they do not re
spond. Mr. Smith will send i: East, as he
has already received numerous requests
to do so. There is, however, a likelihood
that It will be introduced here, as a num
ber of capitalists are very much im
pressed' with the practicability of the
machine.
A number can be gained In a few sec
onds, and the MOde transmitter makes the
enunclator so perfect that one blowing
into It can be heard over a mile of wire
The nickcl-in-the-slot machines will also
be done away with, as a flat rate of $3 to
$5 per month will be charged. This. Man
ager Charles Gore soys, can be done and
a sufficient profit be made.

PEOPLE ARE
TERRORIZED
Hayes Valley Thugs Rob
and Plunder.
A PEDESTRIAN HELD UP.
THREE YOUNG MEN WITH
GUNS TAKE HIS PROPERTY.
Residents Threaten to Form a Vig
ilance Committee to Do
Effective Police
Work.
Emphatic complaints have been made
to the police recently against the noto
rious Hayes Valley gang, who have been
terrorizing the residents of that neigh
borhood. The police sc-em powerless or
indisposed to check the depredations of
the gang, and the residents are talking
of forming a vigilance committee for the I
purpose of doing Borne effective work.
Burglaries and robberies, thieving and
destruction of property have constituted :
the work of the gang, and they have be- j
come so daring that robbery has oc- j
curr^d almost in broad daylight.
Sunday night a gentleman who lives |
on Eighteenth and Church streets was |
visiting friends on Oak street. He w.is
walking along Oak street, between Bu
chanan and Webster, shortly after 8
o'clock, when three young men stepped I
up to him and each presented a revolver
at his head, while one of them peremp
torily ordered him to throw up his
hands. He had no alternative and
obeyed orders. Two of the footpads
kept him covered and the third went
through his pockets, relieving him of Ills
gold watch and chain, $30 in gold and
*2 or $3 in silver. They then fled.
The robbery was witnessed by Mr. and ,
Mrs. Rubin, who keep a variety store I
on the corner of Buchanan and Oak
streets, and Mrs. Rubin promptly blew
a police wi.iEtle. The victim came to
them and Rubin, taking the police whis
tle from his wife, went with him along
Buchanan street, blowing the whistle,
but it was nut until they reached Hayes
street that they came across Policeman
M. Barry. The ofticer was told of the
robbery and took the victim to the Cen
tral police station, where the details of
tho robbery wÂ»rc given to Lieutenant
Birdsall, but, strange to say, neither the
nant nor the officer took the man's
name.
An accurate description of the three
robbers was given, but so far no arrests
have been made The robbers overlooked
a lady's gold watch in their hurry to
linish the job.
It is supposed that the same gang
broke into the residence of J. A. Wald
teufel, 519 Oak street. Saturday night,
and stole a K"ld watch and chain and
several valuable articles of jewelry. He
and his wife had gone downtown, and |
when they returned they found one of i
the rÂ»=-ar windows open. An investigation j
showed that burglars ha<) been i:i the
house, and as .soon as Mr. Waldteufel
ascertained the full extent of his loss he
reported the matter at police headquar
ters.
There have been numerous burglaries
In the locality within the past few
months, and there is a strong feeling of
terror among the residents, as they do
not know what the gang may do next.

TJIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 22, 1898.
McCONNELL---FOUR ROUNDS.
McKeever, the Crack Easterner, Quickly
Forced to Lower His Colors.
FRANK McCONNELL of this city
bested Charley McKeever of Phil
adelphia, in four rounds of their
intended twenty-round boxing con
test before the National Club at
Woodward's Pavilion, last night.
McConnell opened the eyes of his most
ardent admirers, for he not only met the
clever Easterner at his own game of
slapping, ducking and jabbing, but he
went him one better in adding a hook
blow that landed on McKeever's chin and
put him to sleep in short order.
The evening's entertainment was well
worth seeing. The preliminary bout be
tween Purcell and Jackson was a dash
ing set-to, and way above the average
"curtain-raiser." And the event of the
evening was a sharp, snappy affair which
kept the spectators on edge and evoked
tumultuous applause at the end of each
round while it lasted, in appreciation of
their really clever work.
It would be hard to find two men more
evenly matched than McKeever and Me-
I Connell, or more alike in build. They are
I both heavily multc.led and broad-shoul
j dered, with slight, tapering legs, as
j agile as monkeys and quick as cats.
A long delay intervened between the
j preliminary bout and the event of the
evening, owing to McKeever demanding
1 an assured purse of $800, on account of
! the smaUnesa of the house. The fighters
and the management finally came to an
understanding and the men agreed to
I go on.
McConnell entered the ring at 10 minutes

past 10 o'clock, accompanied by his sec
onds. Alec Greggains, Martin Murphy and
Frank Schooler.
McKeever folowed ten minutes later,
esquired by Hilly Akers, Billy Shannon
and Paddy McGrath.
Billy Jordan, master of ceremonies, in
troduced the men. MeConnell received
most of the applause, naturally, being a
local man.
Phil Wand of the Olympic Club, chosen
as referee a week before the light, acted
in that capacity.
Jordan also announced that Tom Tracey
had wired from New York a challenge to
the winner.
It then took Manager Groom half an
hour to count and gather up the $800,
which he put In a satchel and deposited in
the ring. Then the referee and represen
tatives of the fighters bad to recount the
money, so that it was lo:4o before the
fight started.
The crowd bemme very impatient dur
inp rill this vexatious delay, and many
unkind things of Manager Â£room and the
National Club were thought and said by
the audience.
After the monetary troubles between
the pugilists and the National Club man
ager had been settled, Referee Phil Wand
signaled the clockmasttr to get ready, and
the gong sounded the fighters to action.
MCKEEVER'ANDWCOMNELI
i-J/IDTWF PRIVELEGEOF
100KW&-AT TH^ATCHEL
ED DOUGH.
McKeever, catlike, sprang from his corner
which was the southwest end of the ring,
and evidently determined to make quick
work of his amateur opponent, lost no
time in fiddling for an opening, but went
right at his game.
A feint, then nut shot MeKeever's left,
which landed lightly on McConnclTs
neck, and as quick as a Hash came the
right, which missed the amateur's jaw
by scarcely an inch. McConnell, realiz
ing that a fast fight and a quick ending
was the order of the evening, sidestepped
away from the Philadelphi.in, but re
turned quickly with a wicked left-hand
hook, which blow was cleverly ducked by
the professional. Again McKeever in
troduced a hot fire from the right and
left war implements and for a few sec
onds it looked bad for California, but Mc-
Connell was acting coolly and as McKee
ver got within range of his left he (Mc-
Keever) received a mouth-warmer which
sent his head back a few inches. Mc-
Connell, seeing an opening for a right
swing at the jaw, sent out^the "duke"
with a high charge of powder behind it,
but the artful McKeever, as quick as a
Hash, ducked the blow and a clinch fol
lowed. The clever lads received quite a
warm cheer from the spectators as they
walked to their corners at the call of
time.
In the second round McKeever resumed
his old tactics. His intention was to rat
tle the ex-amateur by fast fighting, but
McConneil proved before the round was
finished that he was fast also, and could
return blow for blow. McKeever's right
hand stops for blows that were aimed at
the face wore perfection. Time and
again lie blocked his opponent's left when
it was within a few inches of the nasal
target. McConnell was gradually gain
ing confidence and before the round end
ed he planted some hot shot under Mc-
Keever's left arm.
Seeing that McKeever's guard for the
body was not of the best, Greggains In
structed McConnell In the third round to
warm the Philadolphian's ribs a bit, and
several times the Eastern lad felt the
sting of McConnell's glove. Twice Mc-
Connell Introduced a new shift from right

hefra W from SWoV\nÂ£
to left and each time he caught McKeever
by surprise and landed well on neck and
body. The finish of tills round was very
hot. It was give and take and neither
man scored a point in advantage. All
persons voted the contest up to this junc
tur.- as pretty an exhibition of quick and
clever hand and foot work as they had
ever witnessed.
The fourth round settled McKeever's
hash. He whs very anxious to finish the
game as quickly as possible, and again
he sailed in with auick right and left
short firm punches in the hope of dazing
his opponent. Following a sharp rally
McKeever saw. as he thought, a favor
able opportunity of landing a wicked left
and he let it go like a flash, but MeCon
nell, by a quick shift of his head, es
caped the glove, which shot past his chin,
and as McKeever moved in toward him
by the impetus. McConnell's rightâ a
short arm blowâ shot out and the winning
glove landed squarely on the Philadel
phian'fl chin and mouth.
McKeever staggered and fell, the blood
flowing from his mouth. He struggled,
regained his feet only to be sent down
again from a right in the neck. As he
was on his knees In a helpless condition
McConnell rushed at him, but the police
had now taken possession of the ring and
Referee Wand declared McConnell the
victor amid the wildest enthusiasm imag
inable.
The ex-amateur is now a fitting oppon
ent for any welter-weight In the coun
try, as he proved himself beyond a doubt
to be a first-class pugilist.
The principals in the preliminary event
entered the ring at ten minutes to 9
o'clock. It was a ten-round bout be
tween two welter-weights. Frank Pur
eell of Salt Lake, and Sam T'impkfns,
better known as "Young Peter Jackson,"

of Denver. "Jnok" Welch was chosen
referee. Ivjrroll weighed about 150 pounds
and Jackson about 140.
Both ni< n put up ;i good, fast fight in
the opening round, hitting clean and
breaking fairly. They landed some stiff
punches on the body] and the darky
jabbed his left repeatedly into the white
boy's face.
The second and third rounds were
equally Interesting, the men going at each
other hammer and tongs. They were
badly winded, but neither had much the
better of it at the end of the third.
The crowd went wild In the fourth. For
a time It looked as If Purcell had the
darky going, but the colored boy rallied
and ut the end had his opponent badly
rattled.
Purcell was nearly gone in the fifth and
could not land hip blows. Jackson placed
a few good straight lefts, but could not
finish his- man.
I'ureell showed up better In the sixth
round, but still took the most of the pun
ishment administered. Jackson continued
to land his straight left on Purcell's sore
face.
Purcell opened the seventh round with
a terrible rush, and they roughed it to
gether for a full minute, giving and tak
ing blows blindly. Purcell weakened
shortly, however, and fought out the rest
of the round on the defensive.
Jackson made Purcell think he was in
a fight in the next round. He landed his
straight left many times on the face,
adding an occasional swing by way of
Variety. Purcell fought back as hard as
he could, but was wild and weak.
Honors were easy In the ninth, both
men being very tired. A good, stiff punch
on the jaw would have finished either,
but neither could land the coveted blow.
Purcell fouled repeatedly in the tenth,
in the heat of the battle. The colored
lad punished him badly and received some
hard knocks himself, which, however, did
not show on his ebony skin.
Both men were on their feet, fighting
hard, when the gong sounded the end of
the tenth round. Referee Welch, after
deliberating a bit, announced the fight a
draw.
The general opinion seemed to be that
Jackson was entitled to a decision as
victor on account of the aggressive fight
he put up.

CROESUS OF THE
FROZEN NORTH
Peter J. Cox, Seal Hunter
and Millionaire.
BRINGS A WONDROUS STORY
REACHED A POINT MANY MILES
NORTHWEST OF DAWSON,
Claims to Have Met Survivors of
Three Expeditions â Plunged
From Frugality Into Ex
travagance.
Peter J. Cox, the seal hunter of the
frozen North, accompanied by J. G. Ber
ry, arrived in this city yesterday morn
ing from Vancouver and he tells a story
of adventure and isolation in the polar re
gions full of interest and color. He has
just completed a tour of the world last
ing four years. His starting point was
the bleak and barren grounds of the un
visited portions of Alaska. Crossing the
narrow strip of sea which divides Alas
ka from Siberia he visited that country,
passing through the icefields of North
eastern Asia and then traveling westward
until he reached Moscow. From a life of
absolute frugality he was introduced to
the civilization and refinements of
Paris and London life. After traversing
two hemispheres he is now in San Fran
cisco. He will soon leave for a brief visit
to his old home among the icefloes.
Cox, according to his own story, was
taken when a babe in the cradle to the
then unexplored Alaska. About thirty
years ago his father left Lawrence, Mass.,
to seek his fortune In Alaska, then re
cently annexed to the United States.
The son was about two years old at that
time and father and son have lived to
gethor in close union from that day un
til four years ago, when the latter start
ed on his globe-trotting expedition. The
last word that the sun heard from his
father was received a few months ago.
It was that he was dying, and this is the
reason why Cox will again return to his
sealing station, many miles northwest of
Dawson City.
The life of Cox has been spent in the
land of everlasting white. He says that
for three decades he had not made the ac
quaintance of a white man other than
the few survivors of the Greely and
Peary expeditions, and he strongly as
serts that he met several of these ill
fated bands. One John Kelly of the
Greely expedition has been engaged with
him and his father in the occupation of
seal-hunting for many years, never re
turning to civilized lands after being res
cued by the Coxes.
Peter J. Cox. as his tale goes, has met
members of the most historic of all ex
ploring bands in the very time of their
greatest despair. He claims to have seen
Nansen and his crew off the northern
coast of Alaska. In hi* travels Cox
heard Nansen lecture and he does Dot
; entertain the most flattering opinions as
j to Nansen's veracity in his observations
| on Esquimaux life, especially in regard to
the purity of the marital relations among
I tht- inhabitants of polar regions. Cox
says that the Esquimaux are ignorant of
the institution of marriage; that a wife
in the far north is a chattel that may be
traded for furs.
Following out his occupation as seal
hunter Cox started from a point 800 miles
north of Dawson and established sta
tions 100 miles apart across the icefields
to the most northern point, called Till
inn. Here was the destination of his ice
march. The journey was made on
sledges and In boats. The large crevasses
in the ice allowed the passage for boats
and this mode of travel waÂ» always pre
ferred to the journey by Pledges.
("ox. according to his own reckoning,
Is a multi-millionaire. He says his fa
ther deposited in a London bank $3,000,000
for his use while in Europe. The seals
were always shipped to a station in Si
beria and there forwarded to Liverpool
and Paris. Â»
The wealth of the Klondike does not
appeal to Cox. He says there are greater
fortunes to be made in harpooning the
seal in the unfrequented north. "Take
the shirt off my back and put me in the
old place and I will get another fortune
In a comparatively short time," he said.
His isolation from an English-speaking
people has made Cox more of a scholar
In the Esquimaux language than in his
native tongue. He traveled, through Europe
with a tutor, who, however, did not ac
company him here.
The arduous and severe life of the
frozen lands will be but a memory to the
seal-hunter. He intends to settle in civ
ilized regions after one more visit and
leave the snow, the ice and the hardships
of harpooning the fur seal to others.
Polar expeditions are objects of ridi
cule to Cox. He says the only possible
way to reach the north pole is to estab
lish stations along the line until that
much-desired place is reached. He sug
gests his own method of travel (that by
sledges and crossing the small openings
in the ice by means of boats).
LULU WAS TOO FREE
WITH HER RAWHIDE
PAID A MESSENGER BOY WITH
BLOWS FROM A WHIP.
Harry Spencer Will Swear Out a War
rant for the Arrest of Mrs.
Cohen.
The too free use of a rawhide whip
will cause Mrs. Lulu Cohen considerable
trouble, as Harry L. Spencer, who was the
recipient of the blows administered by
the lady, says that he will to-day swear
out a warrant for her arrest on the
charge of battery.
Mrs. Cohen, who lived at 116 Sixth street
with her mother, was indebted to Spen
cer In the sum of $2 40, so he claims, and
when he went to collect the bill yester
day evening, Instead of paying him she
drew a whip from behind her dress and
struck him three times. The first two
blows fell on his head, and barring the
pain did no Injury, but the third struck
the boy on the left cheek, leaving a livia
welt four inches long.
Spencer is a messenger boy, and when
Mrs. Cohen was living with her mother at
34 Sixth street he did a number of errands
for her. About three weeks ago she
movwl away, owintr Spencer $2 40, and left
word that he should be told she had gone
to San Jose. Spencer learned a day or
two ago that she was still in the city, and
yesterday afternoon went to her mother's
homo to" ask for his money. He claims
that he was met at the door by a brother
of the woman and kicked out of the
house.
.Last night Spencer went to the house at
116 Sixth street and sent a boy named Jo
seph Casneau up to Mrs. Cohen's room
with a note stating that he wished to see
her. She sent word back for him to come
up, but he refused to do so, fearing thai
she meant to hurt him. Mrs. Cohen finally
came to the hall where Spencer was and,
according to his statement, before she
reached him she made the remark, "I
wonder what he wants," and then with
out another word she began to beat him
with the whip.
Railroad Republican Club Meets.
A very enthusiastic meeting of the
Street Railway Men's Republican Club
was held in Pythian Castle last night.
The meeting was of a social nature and
had the effect of making the men better
acquainted with one another. There were
songs and speeches by Senator Wolfe and'
Messrs. Mauer, Marsh, Ramsey. Manning
and Miller.. A set of resolutions in mem
ory of the late J. H. McCluer, a former
member of the club, was adopted, paying
a touching tribute to the many good traits
of his character, and expressing profound
sorrow at his loss. The club will mccV in
Pythian Castle on the first Thursday of
each month.
