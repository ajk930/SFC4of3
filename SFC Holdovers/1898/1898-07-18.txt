SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 17.â The American flag
) is floating in triumph over the Governor's palace at Santiago \
> de Cuba. General McKibben has been appointed tempor- *
* ary Military Governor. !
The ceremony of hoisting the stars and stripes was worth \
> all the blood and treasure it cost. A vast concourse of 10,000 1
* people witnessed the stirring and thrilling scene that will live
> forever in the minds of all the Americans present. ,
A finer stage setting for a dramatic episode it would be
difficult to imagine. The palace, a picturesque old dwelling in
the Moorish style of architecture, faces the Plaza de la Reina,
the principal public square. Opposite rises the imposing Cath
olic cathedral. On one side is ,1 quaint, brilliantly painted build
ing with broad verandas â the club of San Carlos on the other,
a building of the same description as the Cafe de la Venus.
Across the plaza was drawn up the Ninth Infantry, headed by
the Sixth Cavalry band. In the street facing the palace stood a
picked troop of the Second Cavalry, with drawn sabers, under
command of Captain Brett.
Massed on the stone flagging between the band and the line

The San Francisco Call
of horsemen were the brigade commanders of General Shafter's
division, with their staffs.
On the red tiled roof of the palace stood Captain McKit
trick, Lieutenant Miley and Lieutenant Wheeler; above them,
on the flagstaff, the illuminated Spanish arms and the legend,
"Viva Alfonso XIII." All about, pressing against the veranda
rails, crowding the windows and doors and lining the roofs, were
the people of the town, principally women and non-combatants.
As the chimes of the old cathedral rang the hour of 12 the
infantry and cavalry presented arms. Every American uncovered,
and Captain McKittrick hoisted the stars and stripes.
As the brilliant folds unfurled in a gentle breeze against a
fleckless sky the cavalry band broke into the strains of the "Star
spangled Banner," making the American pulse leap and the
American heart thrill with joy.
At the same instant the sound of the distant booming of
Captain Capron's battery, firing a salute of twenty-one guns,
drifted in. When the music ceased from all directions around
our line came floating across the plaza the strains of the regiment
bands and the muffled hoarse cheers of our troops.
The infantry came to "order arms" a moment later, after
the flag was up, and the band played "Rally Ronnd the Flag,
Boys."
Instantly General McKibben called for three cheers for Gen
eral Shafter, which were given with great enthusiasm, the band
playing "The Stars and Stripes Forever."
The ceremony over, General Shafter and his staff returned
to the American lines, leaving the city in the possession of the
municipal authorities, subject to the control of General Mc-
Kibben.
The Thirteenth- and Ninth Regiments of Infantry will re
main in the city to enforce orders and exercise municipal author
ity. The Spanish forces are to encamp outside of our lines.

NEW YORK, July 17. â A
Washington special to the Her
ald says: Neither formally nor

rectly, has Washington been ap
proached by the Spanish Cabi
net upon the subject of peace,
but the authorities are basing
strong hopes for early peace
upon the logic of recent events.
If some direct proposition for
peace does not come this week,
the authorities expect the war
will be prolonged indefinitely;
that Porto Rico will have to be
forcibly taken; that the Eastern
squadron will have to carry out
the programme of going to
Spain's own shores to crush Ca
mara's fleet, and that Havana
will have to be bombarded from
land and sea and occupied by
American troops before the end
of the war comes. Hence the
present week is regarded here
as a crucial one, and all hands
are awaiting developments with
the keenest Interest.

the objects of the campaign have been

While th e American troops were wit
nessing the parade of the Spanish sol
diers and stacking of their arms, a de
tachment of Spaniards was busily en
gaged In removing the mines from the
entrance to Santiago harbor. This work,
It was expected, would be well out of
the way by nightfall, so that the Red
Cross ship State of Texas could enter
the harbor to-night or early in the
morning.
There is much uneasiness among Cu

Santiago in charge of the present mu

declare they would be marked men.

WASHINGTON, July 17.â The War Department posted the fol

"SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 17.â T0 Adjutant General United
States Army, Washington, D. C. : I have the honor to announce that
the American flag has been this instant (12 o'clock noon) hoisted over

tained by the municipal government. Distress very great, but little
sickness in the city, scarcely any fever. A small gunboat and about 200
seamen left by Cervera have surrendered to me. Obstructions are
being removed from mouth of the harbor. Upon coming into the city
I discovered a perfect entanglement of defenses. Fighting as the
Spanish did the first day it would have cost 5000 lives to have taken
the city. Battalions of Spanisn troops have been depositing arms since
daylight in armory over which I have guard. General Toral for

"SHAFTER. Major General."
At 11:05 o'clock to-night Adjutant General Corbin made public
the following dispatch from General Shafter:
"HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES ARMY, SANTIAGO, July

reported about 7000 rifles turned in to-day and six hundred thousand
cartridges. At the mouth of the harbor there are quite a number of fine
modern guns about 6-inch; also two batteries of mountain guns, to

twelve deaths thus far at Siboney, a
majority of the victims being regulars.
General Shafter detailed the now fa
mous Twenty-fourth regulars, com
prised of colored troops, to keep the
refugees at the Siboney base of sup
plies. Major Lagarde, surgeon in
charge, reports that the outbreak of
fever in our lines is due to contact with
refugees from Santiago.
MORRO CASTLE'S
FLAG IS LOWERED
PLATA DEL, ESTE, July 17.â At 7
o'clock, the hour of the formal sur
render of the 10,000 troops at Santiago
and the 10,000 otherÃ in the district of
Eastern Cuba, the Spanish flag was
lowered from Morro Castle. Steam
launches from the New Tork, Brooklyn
and Vixen entered the harbor this
morning and examined the batteries,
the wrecks of the Merrimac and the
sunken Spanish cruiser, Reina Merce
des, and the torpedo firing station.
They discovered six Spanish merchant
â¢teamers and one small gunboat in the
harbor and a prize crew was placed
upon the latter.
This afternoon the torpedoes were
taken up or exploded, after which the
Red Cross steamer State of Texas en
tered to give attendance to the sick and
wounded in the city. The warships
may not enter the harbor for several
days, probably not until after the ar
rangements have been completed for
transporting the Spanish prisoners to
Spain. Nearly all the American men
of-war are now in Guantanamo Bay.
MANY QUESTIONS
MUST NOW BE MET
WASHINGTON. July 17.â Coincident
with the occupation of Santiago there
are a vast variety of questions which
are being considered by the President
and his Cabinet respecting the future
political conditions which are to obtain
there. There will have to be settled
whether the government of Santiago
Province shall be a military or a civil
one, with military powers vested in the
executive officer, or other form of ad
ministration. Unlike the Philippines,
which, although nominally in our pos-
Bession, are not formally so, all ques
tions of Jurisdiction over, and adminis
tration of the territory of Santiago
must be met immediately. Santiago is
a city of about 40,000 people, and in ad
dition there are a large number of peo
ple in the captured territory whose In
terests will have to be looked after. The
commercial side of the matter also
must be attended to promptly. San
tiago being ours, the preseumptlon fol
lows that the blockade maintained by
this Government will be declared not to
exist and the place made an open port
â the Government maintaining a strict
surveillance to keep supplies from get
ting beyond Santiago and being fur
nished to the Spaniards.
GOVERNOR M'KIBBiN'S
MILITARY RECORD
WASHINGTON. July 17. â General
Chambers McKibbin, who has been ap
pointed temporary military governor of
Santiago, is a member of an old and
well-known Pennsylvania family. He
was born In Chambersburg, not far
from the famous Gettysburg battle
field. Early In the civil war 'he en
listed as a private in the regular army
and almost immediately afterward waa
appointed a second lieutenant in the
Fourteenth Infantry. His next promo
tion was given him on the 10th of June,
1864, when he was made first lieutenant.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
I On August 7 of the same year he waa
' given a brevet commission for captain
j for gallant services in the battle of
North Anna River, Virginia, and dur
ing the operations on the Weldon Kail,
road.
At the conclusion of the war MeKlb
bin chose to remain in the 'army, and
on the sth of January, 1887, he was pro
moted to be a captain in the Thirty
fifth Infantry, and on May 1, 1596,
lieutenant colonel of the Twenty-first
Infantry. He was lieutenant colonel of
the Twenty-first when he went to Cuba.
During the battle of Santiago his ser
vices were of- so distinguished a char
acter as to win for him special mention
in General Shafter's official reports. He
was among the officers recommended
for promotion and was last week
named by the President as a brigadier
general of volunteers. That the Ad-
ministration and Generals Miles and
Shafter repose great confidence in him
is indicated by his appointment as tem
porary military governor of the city.
Captain William McKittrick, who had
the honor to raise the Stars and
Stripes over the palace at Santiago, i 3
an aide-dc camn on the staff of Gen
| eral Shafter. On the 12th of May he
was appointed by the President to be
: an assistant adjutant general with the
rank of captain, and was assigned soon
afterward to the Fifth Army corps, now
under General Shafter's command In
Cuba. He is a resident of California.

UNITED STATES RELIEF STEAM
ER BEAR, at Cape Prince of Wales,
Bering Straits, Alaska, June 23.â The
Bear dropped anchor off the village
here this afternoofl and Captain Tuttle
and I went ashore to see the man who
succeeded In driving 400 reindeer from
here to Point Barrow, s;>o miles, and re
turning to Cape Prince of Wales. 1100
miles in all. His name is W. T. Lopp.
He is the teacher of the public school
here, and, like all of the school teachers
In tMs region, he is also a missionary.
But that should not be laid up against
him, because he is really a friend of the
natives and believes in helping them to
improve their condition in this world.
With him the desire to aid humanity Is
superior to the trading Instinct. Mr.
Lopp is a handsome man of medium
height,' squarely built, has brown hair
and a mustache. He gives the impres
sion of givat strength and endurance.
His expression of features is that of a
mild, patient, yet determined man. Two
years ago, in the dead of winter, Mr.
Lopp and his wife went to call on their
next door neighbor, Mr. Driggs, at
Point Hope, 270 miles away. They
Btayed there a week and then drove
their reindeer team back, having cov
ered a distance of at least E>4o miles.
Probably half of the herd here be
longs to the natives, they having ac
quired deer for their services as herd
ers. A few miles from here an Eskimo
gentleman named Artisarlook (people
call him Charley) owned a herd of
about 100 deer. When Jarvis came
along, Charley cheerfully gave his deer
to the Government, and he and Dr. Call
drove them to Cape Prince of Wales to
Join the others. Jarvis, meanwhile, had
pushed on and collected the Prince of
Wales herd. The natives here were Just
as nice about it, and Mr. Lopp not only
turned over the deer in his charge, but,
at great self-sacrifice, left his wife and
three children among the natives here,
with no wÃlte person near them, and
started for Point Barrow.
Jarvis and Call started ahead on dog
sleds following the coast. On the next
day Lopp left his reindeer station, a
few miles back of this place, and set
out with over 400 deer and seven herd
er?. He took no dog teams because the
deer are apt to be stampeded by dogs.
The herders are to receive $30 a
month for their services. None of them
know what a dollar is and are likely to
trade a dollar for a string of beads
worth a nickel. If the Government pays
them in rifles or flour, and the United
Stales always gives good measure,
their respect for the dollar will be enor
mous.
All but four of the herders were sent
back from somewhere near Point Hope.
From there Mr. Lopp and four natives
drove 400 reindeer all the way to
Point Barrow. This is fact, and not a
cowboy story. Arrived at Point Bar
row, Charley and one other herder were
left to take care of the whole herd.
The expedition has been perfectly
successful. But in sending out the na
tives to shoot wild reindeer, of which
they brought in over 700, Charles
Brower. agent of the Liebes Trading
Company, did more for the whalers
stranded there than this whole expedi
tion would have accomplished had they
received no other aid. Yet in the
States it was not known what resources
were at hand there. The fact that,
owing to Mr. Brower, there has been
no real net**! of outside assistance
should not detract in the slightest de
gree from the credit that belongs to
the members of the Arctic relief expe
dition. Lieutenant Jarvis, Lieutenant
Bertholf, Dr. Call and Mr. Lopp, to say
nothing of Charley and the other herd
ers, went through great hardships and
did wonderfully good work. The rest
of us had a very lonesome winter away
from civilization and showed our good
Intentions, although we could do noth-
ing more.
When Jarvis reached Point Barrow
he found everything in good condition,
thanks to the energy and good judg
ment of Mr. Brnwer. There was no
suffering from hunger, nor had there
been any. Mr. Lopp says he fattened
up on the rations that the suffering
whalers gave him while he was there.
Jarvis did find, however, that the
men were too closely packed into two
houses, while the officers were living
in comparative luxury. So he took
charge of affairs and made the officers
take their share of the men into thoir
house. His action may have prevented
considerable sickness.
He reports that two men have been
lost. The cook of the Rosario, name
not known to me, was frozen to death,
and a man named Kelley of the Orca
fell into the stern holo of the Belvidere
and was drowned. The stern hole is a
ck-ar place which the crew keep around
the stern of a vessel frozen in the ice
co that the ruddor and screw can be
â worked in case of necessity. There
have been two cases of scurvy, now
nearly cured. The names of the vic
tims have not been sent down.
Briefly told, the story of the over
land exppdition is this: Lieutenant Jar
vis and Dr. Call left Tununak and went
Straight to St. Michael, thence to
T"n;ilaklik, thence to" Golovine Bay.
There they met Dr. Kittleson. assistant
superintendent of the United States
Reindeer Station, and now in charge of
the station. He was on his way from
Port Clarence to Unalaklik with the
Government hrrd of reindeer, but turn
ed back with Jarvis and piloted him
over the moutains to Point Rodney.
TKen he returned to his herjd.
At Point Rodney Dr. Call was left to
come along with Charley and his rein
deer, while Jarvis lost no time in
reaching Lopp.
Mr. Lopp's house was buried in the
Fnow and the door was reached
through a long tunnel. Mrs. Lopp met
him at the door and promptly told her
husband that there wa? a native there
who spoke English. They let him In
and Lopp said, "Who are -ou?" Jarvis
told him to guess. He guessed
"Driggs" from Point Hope. Jarvis
told him to guess again. Finally he
suggested that Lopp could find out for
himpelf If he would kindly brush the
snow and Ice off his face. This was
done and Jarvis was disclosed to the
astonished gaze of the Lopp family.
They lost no time In getting ready,
and by the time that Call and Char
ley arrived with the otheri herd, Lopp
was ready to start. But Jarvis and
Call started on February 2, the day be
fore Lopp got underway. They follow
ed the coast line. Arriving at Cape
Espenberg, they thousrht a crossing
was impracticable, so they went on to
the next cape and then crossed to Cape
Blossom. They they met Bertholf,
who had been delayed by bad weather
in which the natives would not travel,
and had arrived there only the day be
fore. They got provisions from him
and Jarvis Instructed him to await the
reindeer herd. Then they pushed on
to Point Hope and from there to Point
Barrow, reaching that point on March
29, having been three months and thir
teen days on the trip from Cape Van
couver, where we landed them on De
cember 16.
Bertholf was delayed a few days at
Tununok waiting for dogs. But he
reached St. Michael the day Jarvis left
there. Orders were left, however, for
him to get together 1700 pounds of pro
visions and to transport them across
country to Cape Blossom, in Kotzebue
Sound. Difficulty was experienced In
getting dogs, and he had to go over
to Golevlne Bay to get some there.
Returning to his base at Norton Bay,
he started across, and, in spite of dis
couraging delays, reached his station
on time. He supplied Jarvis, and after
ward Lopp. Then he went on with
Lopp, and when the latter turned north
he went on to Point Hope, where Jarvis
directed him to remain.
It was a great thing for Lieutenant
Jarvis and Dr. Call to reach the
whalers at Point Barrow, but, had they
been starving, the whalers would not
readily have eaten them, however much
they liked them. For that matter they
had got too thin to be palatable. Now
Bertholf would have been another
proposition. He kept his fat and good
nature throughout.
So the success of the expedition re
lied on Mr. Lopp and his reindeer herd.
Jarvis told him that, knowing little of
the animals, he would push on and
leave the work and the credit entirely
with Lopp. And Mr. Lopp came up to
expectations and went away beyond
them.
At Cape Espenberg, learning that
Jarvis was stalled about thirty miles to
the eastward short of provisions, and,
distrusting the natives there, he char
tered a dog team from the native vil
lage, went down to Jarvis, found him
all right, then returned to Cape Espen
berg. There he thought it impossible
to cross the Ice to Cape Krusenstern, as
it was piled into high hummocks and
ridges, and he thought the deer would
not drive over such roads. The natives
thought it could be done, and it was
done. They had nearly crossed when
the deer stampeded and nearly reached
Cape Espenberg again before the seven
cowboys could turn them. When they
got to the other side Lopp found a sign
board with a letter from Jarvis telling
him that Bertholf was at Cape Blos
som. So down there went Lopp, found
Bertholf and brought him and his pro
visions to the herd.
About the vicinity of the Waleek
River, Lopp turned to the north, while
Bertholf went to Point Hope. He over
took Jarvls and Call at the mouth of
the Pitmagea River and they went on
together as far as the Kukpowrak. It
was found that the dogs and deer did
not go well together, although the deer
were being driven as fast as the dogs
could go. But of course there had to be
more time taken for camping each
night and herding in the deer than
would be necessary to unhitch the dogs
and get supper. Every day Lopp sent
men ahead to prepare the camp, and
he showed excellent generalship
throughout. So, leaving Jarvis at the
Kukpowrak River, he struck Into the
interior, while Jarvis continued along
the coast line as before.
Mr. Lopp reached Point Barrow on
March 30, with 400 reindeer which he
had driven over the icy wastes as fast
as the others could go alone in dog
sleds. His Journal shows that he had
the deer on the run most of the time.
Shortly after picking up Bertholf, thir
ty-four deer stampeded and were lost,
but when the three herders were sent
back, they found them and took them
all into Point Hope. Only twenty-eight
deer were lost by accident and for food
during the whole trip. Nine of them
were lost on the ice pack crossing Kot
zebue Sound.
Jarvis reached Cape Prince of Wales
on January 25. He left on * ebruary 2,
reached Point Hope on February 20 and
Point Barrow March 29. Lopp left Point
Barrow on his return trip on April 5,
and got home to Cape Prince of Wales
in thirty-one days, only twenty of
which were traveling days, for he met
some weather in which he could not
travel, and he would not travel on Sun
day when he was proceeding on his
own account. The lowest temperature
that he experienced was 43 degrees be
low zero. But he told me that was not
half so cold as one day when the ther
mometer was at 40 degrees below zero
and it was blowing a blizzard.
Bertholf reached Point Hope on
March 1. He was in much better con
dition that the others from this ship,
and Lopp says it was simply delightful
to see Bertholf In the midst of a howl
ing blizzard, sitting on a dog sled and
rolling a cigarette. The. deer were left
about thirty miles from Point Barrow,
at a spot where they could get plenty
of moss, their principal food.
Lieutenant Jarvis did not think it ad
j visable to risk the lives of the men in
an attempt to reach Point Hope. He
was able to increase their rations a lit
tle, and with this increase they have
enough provisions to last until August,
when we will probably be able to reach
them.
The whalers are all in rags and It is
doubtful If we can get enough clothing
to cover them when they come on
board. Jarvis writes that clothing and
bedding will be needed for 100 men.
Without doubt these men owe their lfves
to Charles Brower. He has shown him
self equal to any emergency. if we
get any more reports of suffering at
Point Barrow, the country can rest
easily and let Mr. Brower attend to it.
The Bear left Unalaska on June 14^
having stayed there one week longer
than originally intended, because the
people there asked for our protection.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 17.â
Blnce 4 o'clock this morning a stream
of refugees has been pouring into the
city, some naked and all hungry an(f
footsore. Many have fallen by the
wayside.
The town of Santiago presents a dis
mal sight. Most of the houses have
been sacked and the stores have all
been looted and nothing to eat can be
had "for love or money." In the
streets of the city this morning, at the
entrenchments, at the breastworks and
at every hundred feet or so of the
barbed-wire fences were the living
skeletons of Spanish soldiers.
Among the arrivals to-day were the
German, Japanese and Portuguese Con
suls and their families, the British and
French Consuls having arrived day be
fore yesterday.
General Pando was never here, but
3500 men from Man&anillo arrived on
July 3, making the total garrison here
7000.
The contact mines in the harbor were
removed the day Admiral Cervera left,

SPAIN MAY SEND
ANOTHER FLEET
ACROSS THE SEA
Proposes to Divide the Remain
ing Squadron Under
Camara.
NEW YORK, July 17.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: Information has
reached the Government that with a
view to protecting her own coast and
embarrassing this country In its oper
ations against Porto Rico, the Spanish
authorities are thinking of dividing
what remains of the Spanish navy and
sending a portion of it to American
waters. This Government, however,
expects to be able to divide Its forces
so as to not only dispatch Commodore
Watson to Spain's coast with a formid
able force, but to retain under Rear
Admiral Sampson's command a fleet
which will protect the blockading
squadron off Porto Rico and Cuba, the
North Atlantic Coast and the troop
ships which will convey the army of in
vasion to Porto Rico. The effect of the
formation of these two squadrons will
be to cause the authorities to retain a
stronger force in Western waters.
It was positively announced by
Secretary Long before the fall of San
tiago that as soon as that city was
occupied Commodore Watson would
sail east. It 1b expected his departure
will occur the atter part of this week,
although the new Spanish plans may
put a new aspect on the matter.
The auxiliary cruiser Yankee, with
ammunition for the battleships Oregon
and Massachusets, left Norfolk this
afternoon for Santiago, where she will

DESPERATION OF THE
MADRID AUTHORITIES
Pleading for Morocco's Neutrality,
Which They Threaten to Enforce
If Necessary.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1898. by James Gor
don Bennett.
GIBRALTAR, July 17.â Senor Emilo O.
Jeda, Spanish Minister at Tangier, who
returned there to-day, states that he has
received instructions from Madrid to use
every effort to force Morocco to declare
Itself neutral. His excellency will to-mor
row call together the representatives of
other powers in order to bring as much
pressure as possible to bear on Mohamed
Torres, Moorish Minster of Foreign Af-
fairs.
It has been resolved to enforce neu
trality if necessary, and if Americans
should try to disembark they would be
massacred by the Spanish population. An
appeal will also be made to the powers
to make a naval demonstration in Moor
ish waters. This proposal is said to be
favorably viewed by the French, Rus
sian ana German Governments.
HOW TORAL'S ARMY IS
TO BE SENT TO SPAIN
Programme So Changed That Bids of
American Ship Owners Will Be
Entertained.
NEW YORK. July 17.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
There have been two charges In the pro
gramme first contemplated for the trans
portation of General Toral's army from
Santiago to Spain. American ship owners
may send in bids, although Colonel Hech
ner told me yesterday that only neutral
centlmeter mortars, two 8-centlmeter
muzzle-loaders and four 8-centimeter
field pieces in the Estrella battery; one
57-millimeter and one 25-millimeter
Nordenfeldt and one 37-mlllimeter
Hotchkiss in the Socapa lower battery,
and two 6-lnch Hontorias, two 9-centi
meter Krupp and two 15-centimeter
mortars at Punta Gorda.
Four Spanish merchant steamers â
the Mortera, the Reina de los Angeles,
the Tomas Brooks and the Mexico â and
the gunboat Alvarado are now in the
harbor.
The market place has been sacked by
the troops.
Twenty-two thousand refugees are
quartered at El Caney, 5000 at Firmexa
and 5000 at Cubltas el Boniato, where
they have been living for a fortnight.
In one case 500 were crowded into one
building, which was a regular pigsty,
with a horrible stench.
The Spanish troops laid down their
arms at 9 o'clock this morning. They
will be camped two miles outside of the
city limits, under guard, until their
embarkation takes place.
The docks are crowded by Incoming
refugees in a starving condition, await
ing the arrival In the harbor of the Red
Cross steamer State of Texas, as there
are no eatables to be bought in the city.
The entrance of the refugees was
quiet and peaceful, they viewing their
wrecked homes philosophically, as the
fortune of war. Admiral Sampson's
last bombardment of Santiago wrecked
fifty-seven houses In the city, causing
heavy damage.
arrive on Tuesday night or Wednes
day. Commodore Watson will send
one of his ships to Hampton Roads to
convoy colliers to rendezvous near the
coast of Spain, 'ihich has been selected.
It is evident that in any event the
fleet cannot posslhlv leave before the
latter part of this week, by which time,
the authorities say, Spain's naval plans
will have developed and they will know
whether she intends to divide her
squadron or keep it Intact for the pro
tection of her coast.
In the latter case, as already stated,
all of the battle-ships under Rear Ad
miral Sampson's command may accom
pany Commodore Watson, but should
there be any danger of a force being
Bent by Spain to the westward it will
be necessary to retain several of them
under Rear Admiral Sampson's com
mand, as It is appreciated by the au
thorities that a- force will have to be
kept at a convenient point to protect
the blockading squadrons off Porto
Rico and Cuba and the North Atlantic
Coast.
Should Spain send a fleet to this side
of the Atlantic it cannot possibly ar
rive under three weeks. By this time
the authorities hope to have the army
of Invasion landed in Porto Rico. Even
should a force come to this side of the
Atlantic no great danger would follow,
for the simple reason that there are
no coaling depots at which it could ob
tain fuel and it would be placed in the
same position as was Admiral Cervera's
fleet.
ships would be considered. Colonel Hech
ner believed then that American vessels
would necessarily require convoys. To
day, however, he said the bids of Ameri
can transportation companies would be
considered with others.
The second changre In the programme is
that the feeding of the prisoners will be
turned over to the transportation com
panies. The problem of transportation of
these prisoners seems somewhat con
fused. Should American vessels go to
Spain with the prisoners the ports of
Spain might, for some trumped-up rea
son, refuse the landing. This also was
discussed at a conference this morning
which Secretary Alger and Colonel Hech
ner attended, but bids from American
ship owners will be considered.
DISCUSSING PLANS FOR
PORTO RICAN CAMPAIGN
Important Conferences at the White
House Between the President and
His Advisers.
NEW YORK, July 17.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Rear Ad
miral Sampson and some of the vessels
under his command will leave Santiago
the latter part of this week for Porto
Rico, as President McKinley and his ad
visers believe no time should be lost in
operating against the Spanish force there.
Rear Admiral Slcard, Captain Crownin
shield and Captain Mahan were at the
White House this morning discussing
naval plans with the President and again
to-night they were closeted with the
Chief Executive, Secretary Long and Sec
retary Alger, perfecting plans for the
Joint action of the navy and army. These
plans will be communicated to Rear Ad
miral Sampson before his departure from
Santiago. Secretary Long, after the con
ference to-night, admitted that general
plans for continuing the war were under
discussion, but what their nature was he
naturally declined to state. The first
measure to be inaugurated will be the
enforcement of an effective blockade.

terms of capitulation should await the
sanction of the Madrid Government.
General Toral, the white-haired com
mander of the Spanish forces, was
present throughout the session and ap
peared to be utterly heartbroken. He
spoke bitterly of the fate which com
pelled him to sue for peace, but had
no word to say against the gallant men
who had conquered his army. He de
clared that he had little chance to win.
"I would not desire to see my worst
enemy play with the cards I held," he
said to one of the commissioners.
"Every one of my generals was killed
or wounded. I have not a single
colonel left and am surrounded by a
powerful enemy. We have counted
sixty-seven ships off this port.
"And besides," he continued, wearily
waving his hands toward the city, "I
have secret troubles there."
Speaking of the battle of June 24, in.
which the Rough Riders and a part
of General Young's command parti
cipated, General Toral said that less
than 2000 Spanish troops were engaged,
his loss being 265. He would not say
how many Spaniards were killed at El
Caney and before Santiago.
"Heavy, heavy," he said, dejectedly.
In response to an inquiry he said that
transportation would be required for
between 22,000 and 25,000 men, there be
ing that many in the capitulated dis
trict. He informed the officers that
Santiago harbor had been again mined
since Admiral Cervera left.
General Miles remained at Juragua
during the completion of the agreement
yesterday and a copy of the articles
was sent to him by General Shafter
this morning.
"That is splendid," he said, "we have
everything we came after."
General Miles went to Quantanamo
to-day, and it is reported he will re
main there until the Washington Gov
ernment definitely decides about the

of troop ships are lying off here, and it
is believed that a large part of General

DEFENDS AGNEWS'
ACCUSED ATTACHES
Tourtillott and Mrs. Madi^an De
mand Investigation of
Charges.
SAN JOSE. July 17.â After careful
consideration of the question by Direc
tors Curnow, Hale and Gould, it was
decided to-day that, so far as they
wore conccrw>d, no special meeting of
the board of managers of the Agnews
State Hospital would be called to in
vestigate the charges against Dr.
Bponogle, T. T. Tourtillott and Mrs.
Madigan. There is yet a possibility,
however, that the other directors, I'p
ham and White, may brine: about a
special meeting.
From Director Frank Gould It was
learned that Tourtillott and Mrs.
Madigan had asked for an investiga
tion, and Dr. Sponogle stated that he
also would demand one. Dr. Sponogle
Bald It could not be called too soon to
suit him and lie would be represented
by an attorney. His plan is to de
mand that Erv.in Frost come before
the board and substantiate the charges
of wife murder and the ruining of a
young woman at Fresno.
There was another conference be
tween Director Gould and Detective
Frost this morning at the latter's of
fice, but none of the gentlemen who
took part In either last night's or this
morning's secret meeting with Frost
would discuss th<Â» seances, or t'-ll what
the subject under consideration was.
In view of the midnight conference
hHd in Frost's office last night, people
are wondering whether Frost will file
the threatened charges against Dr.
Bponogle.
An interview was had with Director
Gould at the asylum :it Agnews this
afternoon. He declined to discuss the
chorees against any of the accused.
This was what he had to say:
The Call charges me in its headlines

CROSS CADETS.
and is -willing to investigate from the
persons authorized to speak in that n:at
ter can find a word of justification for
that statement.
When I was appointed Director of AÂ«
news in the fall of 1595 It was not at my
roqest, but upon the insistence of Gov
ernor Budd that I accepted the post' 'on.
I did not want it and told him so. When
I entered the board it consisted of three
Republicans and two Democrats, the
Democrats being Mr. White and myself.
It was then proposed by the Republican
members of the board to extend the cour
tesy to Mr. White and myself of electing
some persons whom we might suggest to
fill vacancies created at the request of
and for good reasons given by the then
superintendent of the institution.
I named my half brother at the bmc
gestion of Governor Budd himself. This
is the Ted Tourtillott of whom The ; a 1 1
has had so much to say; and a .'ilrjin.ir,
honester, more competent or more con
scientious young man does not live in
Santa Clara County. Ho has performed
his duties faithfully from the very start
and tended strictly to his own business
and nobody's else. He has suffered by
â¢the tongue of slander, not because of the
truth, but because be was unfortunate
enough to be my brother, and those who
Bought to tear me down have not hesi
tated to endeavor to ruin his young life
and bring sorrow to my poor old mother,
â¢whose solo support he Is.
The vacancy to be filled by White was
that of matron, and he appointed his
sister-in-law. Miss Ella Royce.
. Subsequent to that time Dr. James Cur
now, a life-long friend of mine, was ap
pointed upon the board as the third
Democrat, In the place of W. W. Monta
gue. At the first meeting after that ap
pointment Dr. Curnow. Mr. White and
myself had a conference to agree upon
the organization of the board. They both
desired me to act as president of the
board which I declined to do, being then
a resident of the city of Stockton and be
lieving that Dr. Curnow was better quali
fied than myself by reason of his pro
fession and residence to fill the position.
The question then arose as to the elec
tion of a secretary. Mr. White proposed
George Peckham. I then stated distinctly
that. when the secretary matter came up
I would not make a selection, but would
support any person that Dr. Curnow and
Mr. White would agree upon, if he were
competent. Dr. Curnow did not feel dis
posed to support Mr. Peckham. for rea
sons which be then stated, and which I
considered sufficient. After considerable
time spent by Mr. White In endeavoring
to force us to take Mr. Peckham, Dr.
Curnow and myself suggested several
other name , among them being Antone
Frlant and John T. McGeoghegan. and It
was finally agreed at that conference
that we would elect Antone Friant sec
retary, provided ho would accept the po
sition at a salary of $50 a month. It was
arranged that I should see Mr. Frlant and
ask him if he would do so. I. saw him and
he consented.
We rode to the asylum In a carriage
on the day of the meeting. When we
reached here, Mr. White taking me to one
pUle said be had chanted his m<n<l/iihoiit
Friant. and would insist upon Pecitham.
I told him that it was impossible to Induce
Dr. Curnow to vote for Peckham. He
paid, knowing Dr. Curnow's friendship
for me: "If you will insist upon it he will
vote for him." I replied that I would not
permit any man to dictate to me the se
lection of a man for a position to which
I believed him to bo unsulted: therefore
I. would not endeavor to exercise my In
fluence upon any other man to do such a
thing. He still insisted that I do so. and I
absolutely and peremptorily refused. As
a result the board did not organize at that
meeting.
At the succeeding meeting I was not
present, as I was engaged In the trial of
a lawsuit. I Informed the board that i
â¢would not bÂ« here and reauested it to
continue the organization of the board un
til the next meeting. Notwithstanding
that, the board, ut the instance of Mr.
White, noting with the two Republican
members and against the wish of Dr. Cu'r
iiow, was reorganized by the election of
Mr. Montgomery as secretary. 1 was
much incensed at this action "and came
near having a quarrel with every member
of the board. But I subsequently discov
ered that Mr. White had informed them
that Governor Budd insisted that the
board be organized at once.
The reason I opposed Mr. Montgomery's
election was that at that time I believed
him to be a "gang man." I have alwaya
been opposed to Mr. Rea's methods and
to Mr. Rea politically.
There are now in this institution five
persons employed at my recommendation.
It has been my desire to keep the admin
istration at Agnews as much out of poli
u a / P ossible - and I have at all time*
cheerfully accorded every member of tha
board his fair share of recommendations
to positions. There is not a member of
the board who has not as many persons
ftere recommended by him as X have 1
have always insisted that those people
recommended by me perform their ser
vices faithfully and any complaint against
any one of them has brought from me a
very severe reprimand. It has always
been my desire to do everything that lay
in my power for the unfortunate Inmaton
placed under the care of this institution.
Mr. Gould mentioned quite a num
ber of Improvements hÂ» had suggested
and brought about for both the inmates
and the employes. He continued:
Over a year ago * tendered my resig
nation as a director of this institution
to the Governor, but he refused it because
l>r. Hatch, the former medical superin
tendent, had Interceded with him not to
permit me resign. It has been stated that
this Institution reeks with corruption.
That Btatement is absolutely untrue. The
Institution, in my judgment* is in a better,
cleaner, more uarmonlous condition than
it has ever been In its history since I have
been connected with it.
The reason these so-called scandals have
arisen is that incompetent, untruthful
and vicious people have been turned out
to make room for competent, truthful and
kindly persons. It has been one continual
struggle for the boa.rd of directors for
more than a year past to counteract the
' evil influences of persons here most diffi
cult at times to identify. There is not a
statement made derogatory to this Insti
tution that is not supported by the state
i ments of people discharged from here
because of their lncompetency, untruth
, fulness or cruelty.
Every employe of this institution has
I confidence In the administration, and the
; statement that the institution reeks with
corruption is a slander upon the good
1 names of as reputable men and women as
the roof of The Call ever sheltered.
ALLEGED CRIME OF A

CAMP MONTGOMERY,
Santa Rosa, July 17.
With the sun shining brightly, the green
hills for a background and overhead a
cloudless blue sky. Camp Montgomery
presenfed a beautiful martial scene at
reveille this morning. The Stars and
Stripes were slowly raised while the
League of the Cross Cadets stood anil
respectfully saluted. Shortly afterward
the boys were marched to their mess
tables and partook of their first breakfast
In camp. Guard mount followed at S
o'clock. The quarters were inspected by
Colonel Sullivan, accompanied by {he offi
cer of the day, Captain James Power of
Company H.
At 11 o'clock assembly was sounded, and,
headed by Colonel Sullivan, the entire
regiment marched to the pavilion adjoin
ing the grounds, where military mass was
| celebrated by the Rev. Father Dempsey.
I The ceremony was solemn and impressive
and was attended by a large number ol
Santa Kosa residents. At the close of tho
1 reading of the gospel of the day Fathei
Dempsey addressed a few remarks to the
| cadets, reminding them that they wero
soldiers of Christ and hoping that they
would be at all times during the encamp
ment gentlemanly in their deportment.
After mass luncheon was served to the
boys and for the rest of the afternoon
they were at liberty to go whither they
; pleased.
This morning found twenty-eight of the
I cadets in the guardhouse. Some of them
; attempted to run the guard lines, while
j others decided not to hide their talents
, under a bushel, and after taps annoyed
their companions, who had resigned them
selves to sleep, with vocalistic efforts, un
til they were suppressed and placed in
the guardhouse. This morning the young
men could be seen trundling wheelbar
rows and generally cleaning up the
grounds, much to their discomfort, as they
nearly all had friends from San Fran
cisco, who came to pay the camp a visit.
The health of the regiment la excellent
and the most severe cases Surgeon Major
A. H. Giannlni had to contend with at
sick call wore those of lads who had in
dulged in too many green apples.
The companies have all christened their
streets and large signs greet the visitor's
eye. Company A street is named "Van

neat appearance; the company is in com
mand of Captain W. C. Hopper. Com

at present at Manila in command of the
First Regiment California Volunteers.
The company is commanded by Captain

DAFT ON SPIES

Mania With the Madrid
Newspapers.
STIRRING UP THE POPULACE
ARTICLE AIMED AT AN AMERI
CAN GENTLEMAN.
Dark Hint That His Offenses Are
Much More Serious Than Those
for Which Iglesias Was
Shot.
Special cable to The Call and the Now York
Herald. Copyrighted. IS9B, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, July 17. â Some of the
newspapers here have gone wild over
the spy question. They see spies every
where and in everybody. They also do
all they can to stir up the people
against any one they choose to regard
in this light. Only a day or two ago
El Pals had an article headed "Spies
and Traitors." It was aimed at a di
rector of the New York Life Insurance
Company. So far as it was possible to
gather from the article this gentle
man's principal crime was that he had
been seen in conversation with me in
Pozuelo and often conversing with Mr.
Stanhope, correspondent of the New
York Herald, who has his summer res
idence in Pozuelo. El Pais, which is
nothing if not jingo, ingenuously ad
mits that it could fill columns with de
tails about spies and traitors whom the
Government allows to continue their
work with the greatest impunity and in
"open daylight." It points out that it
has already called the attention of the
Government to the maneuvers of Mr.
Reed, a director of the New York Life
Insurance Company, who, it adds, is,
from all indications, in the confidence
of the Yankee administration. This
paper then accuses Mr. Reed of having
"conferences" with Hannis Taylor and
General Woodford.
As this was in the ante-bellum days,
it is hard to see what is the gravity of
the accusation, as many good loyal
Spaniards also had "conferences" with
former embassadors from the United
States to Spain. However, any stick is
good enough to club a man with, and
El Pals evidently considers the country
is in serious danger because of these
"conferences." Where the malice of
the article lies, however, is in the state
ment that Mr. Reed has agents who
carry and set?k information for him.
"Unfortunate Iglesias," it says, "was
shot in America for much less serious
motives than could be alleged against
Reed and his agents."
The threat is unmistakable.
SKIRMISHES DURING
PEACE CONFERENCES
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
WITH THE ARMY BEFORE SAN
TIAGO, July 16, by Call-Herald Dir
patch boat to Port Antonio, Jamaica,
July 17. â General Wheeler, immediately
after he had returned from the final
conference with General Toral, ex
plained why certain so-called conces
sions were made by the Americana.
"General Toral's appeal for honorable :
terms," said General Wheeler, "was
most affecting. He said his army had
not been vanquished and that such
brave soldiers as the Americans were
should not be ungenerous. We were in
pressed by his earnestness and depend
upon his honor to carry out the spirit
of the agreement fully.
"Many details," General Wheeler
continued, "were merely verbal, but the
agreement was witnessed by Robert
Mason, the British vice-consul. Col
onel Fontaine, General Toral's chief of
staff, signed the agreement for him and
General Escario signed for Captain
General Blanco.
"Colonel Fontaine informed me that
the troops involved in the capitulation
numbered 28,000, being the garrisons at
Santiago, Sagua de Tamano, Caima
nera, Manzanillo, Holguin and a few
unimportant towns. The agreement
contains no reference to the govern
ment of the city or the province after
the United States has occupied them. I
am very favorably impressed by the
Spanish officers and have complete
faith in their word."
Although the truce between the
American and the Spanish forces was
in effect, there were two sharp skirm
ishes between the opposing forces dur
ing the hours just prior to the final
surrender of Toral's army. One of
these skirmishes took place on Friday
afternoon nean Baracoa, the Annapolis
being engaged by Spanish troops. Cap
tain Bunker went to Baracoa several
days ago to watch for a supply
schooner. He entered the bay on the
opposite side from that on which the
Spanish blockhouses are located, desir
ing to confer with the Cubans stationed
there. The Spaniards suddenly opened
fire with field pieces from their batter
ies in front of the blockhouses. Their
gunnery was good and the shells ex
ploded all about the American vessel.
The Annapolis was struck by the frag
ments of several shells, but no damage
of consequence was done. Captain
Bunker returned the Spanish fire, set
ting the barracks ablaze, nearly de
stroying it and silencing the batteries.
The Cubans report that about 1000
Spaniards are in the vicinity of Bara
coa. Nothing was seen of the schooner
and the Annapolis left for Guantanamo
to-day.
Another attack on the Americans
was made yesterday afternoon near
Guantanamo. Some Spaniards, sup
posed to be guerrillas, by a ruse at
tracted a launch from the Marblehead
to the shore. Commander McCalla saw
a man walking up and down the beach,
indicating that he desired to communi
cate with the Americans. The captain
sent a launch and dingy in charge of
Ensign Sullivan, with Captain Sanchez
of General Perez's staff, as interpreter.
When the launch was within 200 yards
of the shore the man disappeared. In
a moment a volley of bullets came
whistling from the bushes, splashing
all around the launch. Ensign Sulli
van ordered his men to reply and they
used their rifles and a one-pounder.
This drew a hot fire from the bushes,
which finally subsided. As a precau
tionary measure the gunners of the
Marblehead let drive two six-pounders.
No one on the launch was hurt.

THE TRADE SITUATION.
T"O Calitornians the local trade situation last
week was more interesting than that of the
country at large. The latter was not partic
ularly striking, and was in fact almost without
ieature, a.> usual in midsummer. There was rather
more disposition to buy wool, and business was lair
for this time of the year, witii former prices easily
maintained. The iron and steel trade, too, showed
more tone, partly on account of decreased produc
tion and partly owing to large orders, particularly in
the West, where a number of mills will forego their
v.-v.ii shutdown ami others will materially curtail
theirs. Indeed, some, mills report orders booked
ahead as far as next winter. This, at a time when
â ..uii generally prevails, is noteworthy. The
k' success of the new loan is the talk of finan
cial circles all over the country. The amount called
lor aas and the amount actually sub
scribed reached the enormous rigure of $1,300,000,000.
while the end is apparently not yet. The fact that
this immense sum has all been subscribed right here
in our own country ought to swell the breast of the
average American with pride. We need never again
go abroad for funds, whether in the. shape of war
loans or in any other form.
Wall street responded to this magnificent showing
by increased buoyancy, which, however, was damp
ened by the uncertainty accompanying the military
operations before Santiago and by the confusion re
sulting from the new stamp tax, which diverted con
siderable speculation from stocks to bonds, which
are not subject to the tax. This wet blanket was in
turn lifted by the surrender of Santiago and the fine
crop prospects, so Wall street had a very unsettled
week all around. The statistical condition of the
country continued gratifying, the bank clearings
being 16.6 per cent over those of the corresponding
week last year, while the failures showed a slight de
crease. The exports of cereals from the Atlantic
coast continued heavy, those of wheat being 2,910,300
inst !.."J2,000 for the same week in 1897.
The distributive trade of the country is at its low
est point in midsummer, so there is nothing new to
report in general business. But already some lines
are preparing for the fall trade, which is expected to
be large, though it is hardly thought that it will reach
the unprecedented volume of the spring business. If
it does the country will boom indeed.
But it is in California that the chief interest centers
for Californians, as already remarked. The 1898 har
vest is now in full blast, and it is the best
we have had in point of returns for a num
ber of years. Prices for hay and grain are more
than profitable, and there is a demand for every
pound that comes into this market. As for fruit, it
has not brought such prices for many a day. The
leading staples at this season are apricots, peaches
and pears. The canners are paying $40(0,65 per ton
for apricots, against $5(??2O last year, $65^70 for cling
peaches, against- $30^/40. and are fairly scrambling
for the pears at $25@30, against $7@20. Pears are
expected to go still higher, for the crop is small, and
the scarcity in apricots and peaches creates just so
much more demand for pears. Even the humble
apple is wanted at much bettor prices than ruled last
Mason, for this crop, too. is small, not only here, but
all over the United States, and the grower this year
can pick up the windfalls and wormy fruit under the
trees and sell them for $7 per ton. whereas last year
they went begging at $3^4. And thus it goes all
along the list of farm products. A gratifying feature
h the comparative independence of the farmer and
fruit-grower this summer. They are now holders,
whereas for a number of years they have been anxious
sellers, only too glad to throw their produce on the
market for whatever it would bring. The good re
turns enable them to do this, which keeps the differ
ent markets from becoming choked with offerings
and holds receipts down to the normal requirements
of the daily demand. Not for years has the Califor
nia farmer been so well situated as he is to-day.
Of course this prosperous condition of the farmer
has its effect on general business. Country credit?
are better and the country demand for merchandise
is good. As the city lives off the country the feeling
here is one of confidence, and all lines anticipate a
good fall trade. San Francisco has been doing well
for months, and the present indications are that it
will continue to do well for many months to come.
An effort is now being made to stir up a factional
fight in the lowa regiment. A great deal of effort has
been expended in a similar way for other regiments,
and happily has achieved failure.
If Binnco really attempted suicide and failed he has
added nothing to his reputation. To kill oneself does
not require a high degree of intelligence, but some
what higher than to try it and make a bungle.
Editor Rush of San Rafael must be the original
"Rush in where angels fear to tread." He went to
jail
San Francisco has heard the "rebel yell" and
didn't scare a bit.
ALSO THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC.
THAT the Wells-Fargo Express Company is re
fusing to bear, its share of the war tax is a mat
ter of record. The Western Union has evaded
the duty of contributing, forcing the public to pay the
proportion Congress designed to fall . upon that
wealthy corporation. The Telephone Company de
clined to pay until it had been obliged to, the law as
to this being clear and specific. The list of un
patriotic corporations Is growing;. It
must be enlarged â¢âº> the addition of thÂ©
Southern I*aciflc. This ln*>t concern
makes the pretense that it is complying
with the law. It is not so comply.
iiip;. To prove that it is not the law needs only to
be quoted:
"EXPRESS AND FREIGHT: It shall be the
duty of every railroad or steamboat company, carrier,
express company, or corporation or person whose oc
cupation is to act as such, to issue to the shipper or
consignor, or his agent, or person from whom any
goods are accepted for transportation, a. bill of lading,
manifest or other evidence of receipt and forwarding
for each shipment received for carriage and trans
portation, whether in bulk or in boxes, bales, pack
ages, bundles, or not so enclosed or Included; and
there shall be duly attached and canceled as in this
act provided to each of said bills of lading, manifest
or other memorandum, and to each duplicate thereof,
a stamp of the value of one cent."
Nothing could be clearer than this. A penalty is
named for failure to comply, and the penalty is direct
ed, not against the individual shipper, but the offend
ing corporation. The Southern Pacific, however, has
a way of construing law to suit itself. In this in-
stance it makes announcement that it will pay the
tax, and then proceeds to pay only a part of it. It
has adopted the method of affixing a stamp to the
original bill of lading, but on the duplicate bills re
quires the customer to pay for the stamps. As bills
of lading are usually made out in triplicate, the com
pany, while boasting of compliance with the law,
really evades two-thirds of the tax Congress has de
clared it shall pay. For it to pay any part is a cir
cumstance the Southern Pacific regards as a conces
sion, but the present emergency does not call for con
cessions. When the company shirks a part of its
responsibilities, making the sham plea that it is doing
all required of it, the sin of hypocrisy but accentuates
the unpatriotic crime of refusing to aid the Govern
ment. The avowal of the Wells-Fargo people that
they will not pay the war tax has at least the merit of
frankness.
Possibly there are authorities which stand so little
in awe of the Southern Pacific that a new construc
tion of the law will be forthcoming. The theory that
this corporation is above the statutes lacks a sound
basis. The time has come for bowling it over. Pri
vate citizens pay. There is neither equity nor act of
Congress behind the proposition that having paid
their own tax. they must go down into their pockets
to pay the tax of the Southern Pacific or of any other
corporation thriving under Government protection,
and actually making extra profit from the war in
which the Government is engaged.
THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
SANGUINE expectations that the fall of San
tiago will soon be followed by an application
on the part of Spain for peace may be shared
by the President and his official advisers, but if so
they are not permitted in any way to interfere with
the resolute determination to prosecute the war with
vigor. Our military and naval authorities are not
waiting to see what Spain will do next, and if her
statesmen hope to make peace in time to escape an
other blow they must act promptly.
This week will probably see the sailing of Watson's
fleet for Europe in search of Camara, the last Spanish
commander whose flag flies on the seas; and of an
army for the occupation of Porto Rico. The success
of both of these expeditions is beyond question. The
events of the war have thus far been so one-sided
that the main interest felt in any movement is in the
time that will be required to execute it. Therefore
the discussion of the descent upon San Juan and of
Watson's pursuit of Camara will turn almost wholly
upon the prospects of having a new victory to cele
brate within the next ten days.
The action of the Spanish Government in proclaim
ing martial law throughout the kingdom is every
where regarded as an evidence that the Ministry in
tends to sue for peace, and is preparing to resist any
outbreak that may result from that confession of
weakness. This belief seems to be well founded, for
hardly any other reasonable explanation can be of
fered for the extraordinary course pursued.
It must be borne in mind, however, that up to this
time no action taken by the Spanish officials in the
conduct of the war has been at all reasonable when
judged by the situation as it appears to American
eyes. It was unreasonable to send Cervera to the
We^t Indies, and it was unreasonable to order him
out of Santiago. The unreasonable, therefore, may
be the thing to expect of Spain for her next
move, and possibly the proclamation of martial law
may imply a determination to force the people to sub
mit to still further war taxes and to continue the fight
until Havana has been taken by force of arms and the
ports of Spain threatened by the gun* of our victori
ous fleets.
It is worth noting that European nations have long
since ceased to show any great interest in the war
itself, and arc engaged almost wholly in commenting
upon what the United States will do with the Span
ish colonies after the war is over. That is in fact the
only vital problem in the contest. The war itself is
beinp hastened to a swift conclusion, and nothing
could more effectually induce Spain to apply for
pence at once than the activity in the army end navy
which so effectually proves that we do not care
whether she does or not.
THE WONDERFUL TURBINfI.
WHILE the American fleets at Manila and San
tiago have demonstrated the dread efficiency
of modern warships in the hands of skillful
and courageous seamen, there has been tested on the
British coast a little vessel whose success promises
to render comparatively valueless the whole internal
mechanism not only of war vessels, but of merchant
steamers, and virtually rtvolutionize marine en
gineering.
The little vessel, called the Turbina, from the pe
culiar construction of her engines, is reported to
have made in several tests as much as thirty-eight
knots an hour. In one test she covered twenty-two
knots in thirty minutes, and more than once covered
short distances at a rate of speed equal to sixty miles
an hour. It is also reported that the sole cause of
her inability to maintain that high rate of speed for
greater distances is that the smallness of her hold
prevents her from carrying coal enough to keep her
engines running.
The expectations raised by the achievements of
models are not always realized when larger construc
tions are made on the same type. An increase of
weight and friction sometimes results disastrously
upon mechanism that works excellently in the small
and light construction of the model. In the case of
the Turbina. however, there are good reasons for be
lieving no such disappointment will occur. In fact,
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 18, 1898.
it is quite possible that some huge battleship or
ocean liner. built on the lines of the new model and
equipped with her machinery may even surpass the
The reason for this sanguine hope is based upon the
fact that the Turbina machinery is not more complex
than that now in use. On the contrary, it is a step in
the direction of simplicity. Its character has not
been kept secret. There is nothing mysterious about
the invention. It is not a Keely motor of unknown
nature. On the contrary, every part of it has been
publicly revealed and explained by the inventor, and
the fame it has acquired is due, not to any hidden
mystery of construction or motive force, but to the
feats it has performed in operation under conditions
that constituted fair tests of its worth and usefulness.
Part of the success of the Turbina is said to be due
to the construction of her hull, but the greater part
is due to the new form of engine with which she is
provided. According to reports this piece of
mechanism is the simplest engine ever devised. Its
most important feature is a shaft, surrounded by rows
of blades, inclosed in a cylinder provided with
grooves corresponding with the blades. Steam is
turned into the cylinder, and in its passage to escape
it drives the blades round like the vans of a wind
mill. It is claimed that as this engine runs entirely
in one direction it produces no jar in the ship, and
as it has few working parts to get out of order, there
is hardly a limit to be set upon the speed which may
be given to its revolutions.
Shipbuilders are proverbially conservative. It is
seldom they venture upon new experiments, for ships
cost money, and the ocean is not a safe thing to
try experiments upon. Consequently it may be some
years before the new engines are in general use. If
the reports of the recent tests of the Turbina are ac
curate, however, it is only a question of time when
vessels on her model will be common on the seas.
At any rate now that we are about to enlarge our
navy it would be worth while for the Government
to give heed to the new ship and her wonderful
feats.
WHEN Frank H. Gould, Democratic politician
and aspirant for all the oftices in sight, man
aged to gain for himself the oftices of director
of Agnews Asylum and president of the State Board
of Building and Loan Association Commissioners it
was believed he intended to use those positions as
stepping stones toward the attainment of the Demo
cratic nomination for the Governorship.
Some thought he would try to make a record of
good administration to which he could point with
pride when he appealed to the people for support.
Others thought he would use the power and patron
age of the offices to win the favor of the Democratic
machine and so win out in the State convention. Both
of these suppositions have been proven erroneous by
recent revelations. Mr. Gould, it appears, has used
his official position not for himself nor for his party,
but solely for the benefit of his relatives and his per
sonal friends.
It is unfortunate for Mr. Gould that both at Ag
news and in the work of the Building and Loan Com
mission there have been scandals surficiently grave
to attract public attention. The investigation of these
scandals has disclosed certain facts which show that
Mr. Gould is neither a good official nor a good Dem
ocrat. He turned down his party at Agnews and
stood in with the Rea gang in San Jose in order to
make a soft job for his half brother and a lady friend.
He turned the State down ou the Building and Loan
Commission and altered an official report for the pur
pose of making a better business showing for an
other friend.
As a fellow who helps his kinsfolks and his friends
at the expense of California Gould has certainly made
a record. It is unfortunate, however, for his hope of
being helpful in the future that his past actions should
have resulted in scandals on the very eve of a politic
i al cai.inaign in which his aspirations for the Gover
norship are at stake.
Mr. Gould, it will be remembered, is one of the
triumvirate who assumed control of the Democratic
party in this city. With his colleagues, Alford and the
Whispering McNab, he carried through the scheme
that has deprived San Francisco Democrats of the
right to have anything to say about their party af
fairs this year. In the committee that was appointed
j to take charge of San Francisco Democracy it is safe
to say that Mr. Gould remembered his friends. An
official who would use the power of his office to help
! his friends most certainly would not hesitate to serve
i his party as he served his State. The man who
would alter an official report to help a friend's busi
ness is not likely to be very scrupulous in manipulat
ing the machinery of his party.
To the Democrats of San Francisco it will be seen
that Gould's record at Agnews and a* a Building and
Loan Commissioner arc matters of special concern.
; He and his friends have assumed control of the
whole Democratic machinery in this city, and if that
control is submitted to, it is safe to say there will be
scandals in the coming Democratic State convention
as startling as those in the Building and Loan Com
; mission if not quite so dirty as those at Agnews.
THE DUTY OF THE DAY.
rOR all citizens who have not already attended to
it, the first duty of the week and of the day is
that of registration. The time allotted for regis
tering is growing short, and already the rush at the
registration office has begun. It will increase in num
bers as the days pass, and with the increase there will
come a greater delay and discomfort among the
crowds that will throng the office.
It must be borrre in mind that the duty of register
ing this year applies to all citizens. Former regis
trations do not count. From the slow way in which
voters have been attending to registration there is
reason to believe that a considerable number of them
are under the impression that as their names are on
the present great register they will not have to regis
! ter over again. Such impressions are erroneous. In
! order to have a vote at the coming election not only
\ must all new voters register, but all who have been
i registered must register again.
The time {or registration closes August 9, but little
more than three weeks away, and but a comparatively
j small proportion of the voters of the city have as yet
1 attended to the duty. Two years ago, when the
Presidential election was approaching, the people were
, fairly prompt in having themselves registered, but this
j year they are for some reason dilatory and slow.
j Nevertheless the issues to be determined this fall are
\ hardly less than those involved in the contest of 1806,
j and when the campaign opens it will be found one of
i the most exciting in our history. It is certain that all
I who neglect to register, and thereby lose their vote,
I will deeply regret it when the time comes for the peo
j pie to decide between supporting the administration
1 or the opposition.
To register to-day will hardly occupy more than
five minutes of time. When the rush of the closing
days comes, however, one may have to wait half an
hour in line at the office. To register is a political
duty, and to attend to it to-day will be wisdom.
No captious critic will arise to accuse Miles of not
throwing bouquets to his fellow officers-
of the model itself.
HELPING HIS FRIENDS.
CHIEF LEES
AT HIS OLD
TRICKS AGAIN
Popper Says HeWas Approached
to Withdraw the Famous
Salary Suit.
The following question was asked of Max Popper yesterday:
"Were you not approached by prominent members of the Police De
partment and asked to withdraw your suit which is now on appeal in the
Supreme Court, affecting the constitutionality of the bill passed by the
last Legislature increasing the salaries of certain officials in the Police
and Fire Departments?"
Evincing considerable surprise at the query, Mr. Popper replied:
"Yes, it is true that I was approached on two occasions by mem
bers of the detective department with reference to the case. The action
has been on appeal from the decision of Judge Seawell â which went
against me â I should say about eight months. During this period I
have been asked to agree to an extension of the time for filing a brief
in answer to my transcript on appeal to the appellate court. In each
instance I consented to the proposition and the respondent's brief, cov
ering about two hundred pages, was finally filed. My attorneys did
not see any particular merit in the points made by the attorneys for the
two departments, except the claim as to the right of the Legislature to in
terfere with purely municipal affairs. The sole important feature of their
brief is the effort to convince the Supreme Court that the Police Depart
ment is a quasi State institution. However, a peculiar thing in connec
tion with that document is the fact that they make no reference what
ever to the Fire Department. It is evident they consider that the only
MAX POPPER, Who Was Approached by Chief Lees'
Men With a Proposal to "Come Off."
peg that they have to hang their hats on is the possibility of confus
ing the appellate court as to whether or not the Police Department is en
tirely a municipal body. The constitution covers the point ihey endeavor
to make and the recent decision in the case of the Board of Supervisors
will have an important bearing on the result of the action.
"I was met one day by a couple of the detectives and the subject
of this suit came up. After considerable talk they asked me if I would
sign a stipulation agreeing to have the case advanced on the calendar of
the Supreme Court. I replied I was not looking for any delay and that
in the past their attorney had several times asked for and been granted
continuances by me thi'ough my attorneys. I think the proposition to
advance the case was agreed to by my attorneys, but I am sure I do not
know whether or not the court has consented to grant such a conces
sion. Why the department should suddenly desire this expedition in
bringing the action to a decision after previously seeking delay I do not
know.
"The second time the members of the department came to me with
reference to the case Detective Bee was the spokesman.
"The pros and cons of the matter were laid before me by that gen
tleman and I was flatly asked if I would withdraw the suit and not let it
go to a final decision."
"Did Mr. Bee give you any valid or other reason why you should
abandon the action After all the time, thought and money you had de
voted to testing the legality of the act of the Legislature; or why such a
request should be made after you had consented to have the case ad
vanced on the calendar?"
"No," replied Mr. Popper, "he did not give any reason, or ex
plain himself in any respect, but just simply asked me if I would do
the department that favor.
"I did not give them any definite answer at that time, but told Mr.
Bee I would take the matter under consideration. I consulted my at
torneys on the subject and they advised me to stand on my appeal, as the
point at issue involved the vital question of home rule or no home rule
for San Francisco.
"As a result of this conference I saw Mr. Bee again and informed
him that my withdrawal of the case would depend on the fate of the San
Francisco charter in the next Legislature. If the charter should be
adopted and the appeal .undecided, there would be no further necessity
for a decision. Otherwise I would insist on carrying the case to a final
decision.
"I desire to say that in instituting this case or in any subsequent
procedure, including my definite answer to the representatives of the
force, I was not nor am I actuated by any personal feeling. I knew
there was a grave principle affecting the welfare of the city involved
and I undertook to have it adjudicated to the benefit of the munici
pality.
"Of course, I realize that they want their salary, but if the law is
constitutional they will get back pay from the date that the statute
went into effect. So there will be no loss to them if they lose on my ap
peal. If they win they will be all right. The possibility of the adop
tion of the new charter may have something to do with the desire to
have the case dismissed. The withdrawal of my appeal would place the
law in full operation and back salaries would be due and payable. How
ever, as no injustice will be done to any parties in either the Police or
Fire Departments, I shall let matters take their course in the Supreme
Court. In the cases of captains, I believe the increase is $100 per
month, and this figure is graduated down in proportion to the detec
tives, who would enjoy an increase of $25 per month. If a man is a real
detective and capable of filling such a position, I for one would not ob
ject to his receiving $150 per month, but the trouble is there is seldom
one who properly comes under that classification."
For several days there have been
ugly rumors on the streets that the
head of the Police Department was en
deavoring to interfere with the pro
gress of a case in court which particu
larly affects his interests. Ordinarily
such stories do not attract any marked
attention, for since Captain Lees was
promoted to the chair of the Chief com
plaints as to such interference In crim
inal cases have become notorious.
In this Instance, however, the matter
is a serious one, and it seems that the
Chief, through his subordinates, as
pires to not only run the Police De
partment, and Police Courts according
to nig second childhood ideas, but has
been aiming at the biggest game in the
State in the shape of the Supreme
Court.
The head of the department had
enough discretion left to not Instruct
his men to directly attempt to inter
fere with the progress of Justice in that
august tribunal, but the evidence ad
duced indicates that he had the audac
ity to permit two of his most trusted
men In the Detective Department to
try to accomplish such a result by In
direct means. _~,-_*
The details of the supposed secret
operations of these agents of the cnier
will prove highly interesting, particu
larly to those of his friends who can
not yet realize that his age and mental
decreptitude unlit him to properly ad
minister the high office he occupies.
It will be remembered that the last
Legislature passed a law increasing tne
salaries of certain officers of the Police
and Fire Departments. In the case or
Chief Lees the raise was the snug sum
of $1000 per year, captains $1200 per
annum, and lesser increases for mmor
officers, including detectives.
Max Popper took great interest in tne
law and after consulting his attorneys
concluded that the statute was not only
unconstitutional, but vicious, by veason
of the fact that if it proved constitu
tional and stood upon the statute
books it would be a serious stumbling
block to any future efforts to secure
home government for San Francisco.
He therefore instituted a suit against
Auditor Broderlck and obtained an in
junction restraining that official from
paying the increased salaries. The
case was tried before Judge Seawell
and the decision went ag^st Mr. Pop
per. Believing there was a possibility
of a reversal in the Supreme Court, he
filed an appeal. This was about eight
months ago. Garret McEnerney, repre
sented the two departments in the ac
tion and while apparently taking no
steps to respond in the appellate court,
succeeded several times in securing
Popper's consent to grant more time in
which the answer should be filed. It Is
said that up to the present time he has
failed to submit such document.
In the meantime Dunn & McPyke
appeared in the action, being presumed
to represent the subordinate officers in
the two departments affected by the
law. These attorneys finally filed a
brief, which Popper's legal advisers de
clare does' not contain a point sufficient
to enable the appellate court to affirm
the Judgment in the lower court. In
short, it is stated that the main point
made has been decided aerainst their
proposition in the case of the Board of
Supervisors of this city, in which it
was decided that the State law did not
apply to the board by reason of the
fact that it was purely a municipal
body.
During the evolutions of the case
some supposedly brilliant idea must
j have struck the -reat controling brain
of the "upper office," and it was evi
dently decided if possible to head off
the case before it went any further.
After the several moves for delay had
been successfully made, the promoters
of the law took an opposite course and
went at Max Popper for more conces
sions. This time, however, the work
was not entrusted to an attorney, but
Detectives Bee and Harper, two of
! Lee's most trusted and reliable men,
i were shouldered with the task of work-
Ing the good-natured Mr. Popper on the
new tack.
The selection of Harper to perform
' this delicate operation was not accl-
I dental, as Indicated by the fact that
he is one of Popper's most intimate
friends, and owes his position to-day to
the influence of Ponrier.
The first proposition made by the
representatives of the Chief was that
Mr. Popper consent to sign a stipula
tion asking the Supreme Court to ad
vance the cause on the calendar in or
der that an early decision might be se
cured. Mr. Popper replied that what
ever delays there had been in the case
were due to th<- actions of the attor
neys for the departments and that he
was quite willing that the action be
expedited in that manner or any other
proper way.
The matter remained in this status
for some time, during which the Chief
in rattling around and trying to regu
late the proceeding in the Supreme
Court must have collided with some un
expected and indurated formation, for
Detectives Bee and Harper were in
structed to not only turn a back som
ersault, figuratively speaking, but to
use their influence with Mr. Popper to
induce him to perform the same diffi
cult feat.
These gentlemen accordingly sought
Popper and asked him to withdraw his
suit, notwithstanding his long and
earnest efforts to determine the validity
of the law.
What reasons were given for asking
Mr. Popper to adopt such an astonish
i ing course or what suggestions were
made as to the particular manner in
which his favor would be appreciated
have not been made public, but there
is a very well founded rumor that Mr.
; Popper was offered the political influence
! of the entire Police Department if he
j would accommodate the Chief by with
: drawing his appeal.
At any rate the appeal made by the
detectives was sufficiently Interesting
to cause Popper to "take the matter
I under advisement." However, after
, considering it thoroughly and consult
ing his attorneys he again met the
Chiefs right-hand men and notified
them that he could not stand up to
such a proposition, and proposed to see
that the case went through on its
I merits. As Chief Lees has been in an
unusually savage mood for several
I days past, it is evident that the report
of Bee and Harper relating the ut
i ter wrecking of the queer scheme must
have been highly exasperating to the
old gentleman.
Max Popper, when told that the Btory
' was on the street, explained his cnn
| nection with it in the foregoing pointed
i Interview.
LEES SAYS HE DON'T KNOW
"I know nothing about the matter,"
said Chief Lees last night, when asked
by whose authority Bee and Harper
had asked Mr. Popper to withdraw his
appeal. "If anything of the kind was
; done, it was on Detective Bee's own
! responsibility as one of a committee
I representing the subordinate officers of
; the two departments. There are two
I suits; one affecting myself and Chief
Sullivan of the Fire Department, and
the other brought by the men. Garret
McEnerney had the main case at first,
but the men were not satisfied with the
: delay and retained Dunne & McFyke
to represent them. They have filed a
brief, which I have not read as yet. In
my suit I do not think McEnerney has
filed any response to the appeal. Ihavc
nothing to do with the other cause, and
do not believe that Bee or Harper ever
asked that such an action be taken by
! Mr. Popper. I do not see what they
could gain by it. The case would be
left in the original condition and Brod
; crick would not recognize their claims
j for extra salary unless the Supreme
Court finally passed favorably on the
case. There is a mistake somewhere,
but I do not know where it came from."

A GERMAN TRANSPORT PURCHASED.
The Steamer Scandia Has Come Here at Full Speed From Nagasaki, Japan, to Be
Fitted Out to Carru United States Troops to Manila.
88 Finding It Impossible to secure a sufficient number of suitable transports in San Francisco Uncle Sam has gone Jg
Jg foreign in search of them. The big German steamer Scandia has been brought here in a hurry from Nagasaki, Jg
88 Japan, and she will go out with the next fleet to Manila, 88
Jg In all eighteen vessels have been withdrawn from the coast trade, and some of the steamship lines have been 88
J g crippled in consequence. After a great deal of maneuvering the vessels now being and to be got readyâ the Perm- 88
Jg sylvania; City of Rio de Janeiro and St. â were secured, and that almost swept the sea clean of transports. The 88
â¦,: steamers now on the way to Manila are: City of Para. City of Sydney, City of Peking. City of Puebla, Australia, 88
88 Zealandia, China, Indiana. Ohio, Morgan City, Colon, Senator, Newport, Valencia and Peru. The vessels now being 88
% got ready are the Pennsylvania and City of Rio de Janeiro, while the St. Paul will be fitted out on her arrival from 88
88 the gold fields. . 88
83 The first. of the transports secured from outside sources, therefore, is the German steamer Scandia, and her 88
88 officers say she can carry ISOO troops. Last year she was chartered as a transport by the Russian Government and 88
88 carried 2000 Russian troops from Odessa to Port Arthur. She came here in ballast- and will probably go to Mare 88
88 Island to-day, where she will be handed over to the Government; or, if the transfer takes place in the bay, her 88
8* polyglot crew will be put aboard an outward-bound steamer and the Scandia will be manned by American engineers, Jg
fi firemen and sailors. At present the big steamer's crew is made up of Germans, Italians, Greeks, French, Arabs, 88
88 Turks, a few Englishmen, Scandinavians and not one American. The 'Arabs and Turks are led by one Hassan 88
Jj Ahamed. All orders are given through him, and what he says is law. They are a motley crowd, some of them 88
88 being as dark as the blackest ; negro and some lighter colored than the Italians. Hassan speaks English fluently JJ
Jg and has been in San Francisco before, having come here on a sailing vessel from Australia. When seen aboard the 83
88 Scandia yesterday. Hassan spoke with pride of his descent from the ancient leaders of the Ishmaelltes. "My real 83
88 home is in Cairo," said he, "but I also have wives in Port Said, Colombo and Aden. When I reach one of those 88
% places I give my wife what money I have earned, and that keeps her until I get back again. I do the same thing 88
83 at each place where I have a wife, and (with a grin) sometimes one wife gets very little. When I get back from 88
83 this trip I expect to have enough to please all of them, that is if I don't take another wife with me from San 83
88 Francisco. Last time I was here I fell in love with a very pretty American girl. She used to live on Telegraph Hill, Jj
Jj and if I can find her, and she is not married, why I may make her Mrs. Hassan Ahamed the fifth." 88
88 The Arabs and Turks were engaged at Port Said to work as coal passers. They turned out to be a very lazy 88
88 set and it was almost Impossible to get any work out of them until Assistant Engineer Krautzer hit on a scheme by 88
88 accident. While talking to them in very forcible German one day he raised his hand while gesticulating and used 88
JJ the words "Mohammed" and "Allah." Immediately the Arabs grabbed the coal baskets and at the same time began 88
â¦; praying. They worked from that on with a will, their prayer meanwhile rising at times to a shriek of suppliea- 8*
% mii and at times dying down to a low wail. Whenever they would slacken in their efforts Krautzer would again 83
*i raise his hands and say "Mohammed" and "Allah" and that was sufficient to spur the Arabs to fresh efforts. gj
88 The Scandia was built at Stettin In 1889. She is 4375 tons gross and 2926 net burden. She Is 370 feet 7 inches long, . Jg
88 44 feet 3 inches broad and 26 feet 5 inches deep. She has very powerful engines and although in ballast maintained 88
8$ a speed of 13*Â£ knots an hour from Nagasaki to San Francisco, covering the distance in sixteen days. The Scandia 83
88 belongs to the Hamburg-American Steamship Company and has been used principally as a freight boat, although Jg
?8 she has first-class passenger accommodations. Two years ago she was in New York and went from there to 83
â¦* Genoa. At the latter port she loaded a general cargo for Buenos Ayres and then went back to Genoa. From there 83
JJ she expected to return to Hamburg, but was ordered to Odessa to carry troops for the Russian Government to Port 88
88 Arthur. From Port Arthur she went to Nagasaki, Japan, to load for Hamburg, and just as the crew were figur- 88
JJ ing on once more seeing the home port the captain received a cablegram to go full speed to San Francisco. Her 88
88 speed of 13V6 knots an hour was maintained throughout the voyage on an average consumption of sixty tons of 83
88 coal a day. 88
83 The Scandia will make a splendid transport. She is splendidly ventilated and soldiers can be accommodated on 88
88 the first and second decks. Forward, some of the bunks used by the Russian soldiers are still standing, but will have 88
% to be torn down. They are of the old six-in-a-row pattern that were put in the City of Peking. In every compart- 88
JJ ment where the soldiers were berthed pictures of the Czar and sometimes one of the Czar and Czarina were put up. 88
88 Every one of these was mutilated by the soldiers before they left the ship. In some instances his Majesty had an 88
88 eye put out, in others his head was cut off, while again only a portion of the head was missing. Strange to say 88
83 the head only was mutilated, while the Czarina's picture was not touched at all. The officers of the Scandia are 88
Jg Captain Luneschlop, Chief Engineer Mahler and Purser Muller. jj

The New York's camp was pitched bark
some distance from the roadway, and no
one was allowed through UM guard lines
Everj'thing was conducted with perfect
regard for military system and discipline,
and it was the general comment among
the visitors that the camp of the boys
i from the Empire State was more like that
of the regulars than that of any volun
i teer regiment that has yet been here. The
health of the regiment is excellent not a
single soldier being in the hospital, and
the only ailment among the men is a cold.
The officers of the New \ ork Keg. men t
are indignant over the article published
in yesterday's Examiner under the cap
tion of "Where a Pull Was Potent, in
which they are more or less ridiculed be
cause of their high social position and
wealth ami because Colonel Barber ob
jected to having his regiment remain at
Camp Merritt. The officers and men
characterize the Examiner's article as
false and declare that the regiment waa
moved to the Presidio not because of
any pull exercised by Colonel Barber, but
because Burgeon Major Davis of the reei
ment paid he would not be responsible for
the life of any man if the regiment was
kept at Camp Merritt. As it is the regi
ment has not even, so far, had a man
indisposed, while not a single command at
Camp Merritt has escaped several deaths,
except the I'tah' Cavalry.
The Utah Troop of cavalry Is quietly lo
cated in its new camp. Captain Catnc.
who has been his home in Salt Lake
City on a furlough, will return this week.
It seems pretty well determined that the
Utah Troop will be sent to the Tosemite
Valley for duty, and the men are broken
up over the prospect of going back with
out seeing active service.

DISORDERLY CONDUCT.
The Seventh California Raises a
Disturbance Because the
Men Were Not Allowed
to Go to Church.
The order recently Issued from the
Third Brigade permitting all churclj-going
men to pass the lines on Sundays resulted
in a wholesale reformation through the
brigade. Sunday always saw the camp
nearly cleaned out. Yesterday the boys
of the Seventh California were not al
lowed to join in the exodus and a general
balk resulted.
After retreat the men crowded to thÂ«
sentry and set up a wild howl at beinÂ»
denied their liberty, and finally wound v],
by demanding to see Brigadier General
Otis, but he declined to parley. Lieuten
ant Colonel Schreiber ordered the com
pany officers to drive the men back to
their tents, and after some little trouble
they succeeded in doing so, though not
before the demonstration had assumed
the proportions of a good-sized ruction.

A union mass meeting of all the city
churches was held under the auspices of
the Christian Commission at the associa
tion hall, Muson and Ellis streets, yester

the army and navy over the recently
achieved victories. He pointed out thai
Spain had reached the zenith of its naval
power and the greatness of its posses
sions during the fifteenth century, and
that her motto was "Ne Plus Ultra." He
hoped America would adopt the motto
"Plus Ultra." During .the afternoon Mrs.

THE SEVENTH EAGER
TO GO TO THE FRONT
A STRONG PLEA IN FAVOR OF
ITS SELECTION.
Reasons Why the Popular Southern
California Regiment Should Be
Given a Chance to Face
the Foe.
The following communication is self-ex
planatory:
To the Editor of The Calf: It appears
that in the designation of the volunteer
regiments for active service abroad it is
probable that the Seventh California
Regiment, composed of men from all
parts of Southern California, Is to be al
lowed to remain within the borders of
its own State, while preference Is given
to regiments from other States, for al
ready on two occasions when It practic
ally received' its orders when to depart
the orders have been changed and other
organizations were substituted. This re
sult will fall as a great blow upon the
1300 men who quitted their homes to go to
war; but this feeling will be all the more
intensified if they know that the citizens
of their State did nothing to prevent it
and put forth no efforts in their behalf.
It is very evident from the results already
seen that powerful influences are at
work in other States to have as many
of their troops sent to the front as pos
sible, so California must follow the same
course, If only to protect its Just rights.
In every way the Seventh Is a regiment
of which the State may feel proud, and
it can safely be pushed to the front as a
representative organization. In drill and
camp routine it equals the best; there are
in it men representing just as great an ag
gregate of capital as in any other regi
ment sent here; nearly every man left a
business, professional practice or perma
nent employment; the behavior of the
men in and out of camp has been that of
quiet, dignified and gentlemanly soldiers;
they have tried and succeeded in making
themselves and their organization a
credit to the State. This having been their
object, they are now entitled not alone to
the respect of all citizens, but also to the
active work and influence of every man,
who wishes to see our State receive its
proper share of recognition.
Every friend of the National Guard
who desires its success in. the future
should exert himself to see that every
man who enlisted from our militia is
given a chance to do that for which he
volunteered, to go to the scene of war,
otherwise the National Guard of the fu
ture will offer no channel for service to
our country and will be a mere aggrega
tion of socially inclined individuals. If
it was only to satisfy the ambitions and
cravings of the present volunteers in this
country our Government could well af
ford to send every one of them abroad
for the good effect it would have In
furthering speedy enlistments In future
wars. CALIFORNIA.
In Fraise of Our Heroes.
The praises of Dewey, Sampson, Sehley
and Shafter were Bung In a fitting way at
the Hamilton-square Baptist Church last
evening. The Volunteers of Tenness"e
were invited to attend, but they did
not come. After expressing regret at
their failure to be present Rev. W. C.
Jenkins Introduced W. H. Barnes, who
delivered a most eloquent address.
Rev. Mr. Jenkins then spoke. In the
course of his remarks he said: "We are
here to commemorate the victories of the
American army and navy. Glorious have
been their victories, but the glory all be
longs to God. The splendid fleets of the
Spanish no longer float the seas because
rltrht has prevailed, God's cause has been
victorious and we should offer up thinks
glving to him who in his grace has
filled our hearts with courageâ courage to
stamp oppression and its kindred evils
from the world forever."
The Montana Boys Entertained
The First Montana Regiment was the
guest of the Pacific Coast Women's Press
Association on Saturday evening when
the members of the regiment were enter
tained in the large tent In their encamp
ment with a varied and delightful pro
gramme furnished by Mrs. Mary E. Hart,
E M. Marks, Maria Freeman Gray, J. K.
Miller, Miss May Miller, Mrs. Abbie B.
Kreha Herbert Williams, Miss Van Pelt
and Miss H. J. Elliott. The enthusiastic
applause of the boys in blue attested
their appreciation of the beauties of the
entertainment furnished for their pleas
ure.
Volunteers vs. Y. M. C. A.
A picked team from the New York Reg
iment of Volunteers and the well-known
Rushers of the Y. M. C. A. will play a
basket-ball contest at the Y. M. C. A.

promises to be Interesting. The volun
teers are association members from New
burg, N. V., and have played with some
of the best Eastern teams.

GOLD HUNTERS
RETURN WITH
BIG FORTUNES
St, Paul Arrives With Miners
and Boxes of Dust
and Nuggets.
The St. Paul steamed Into harbor at '
6 o'clock last night with 176 passengers
aboard, a great part of whom wero re
turning fortune-hunters from the Klon- i
dike. The best-authenticated estimate or i
the amount of gold in dust and nugget*
that the miners brought with them
reaches at least $3,000,u00 and possibly ;
$4,000,000. This does not include the seven- !
teen boxes of gold of ISO pounds each that j
were consigned to the Alaska Commorciul
c< ntnany.
Jubilant over their rich strikes scores
of mlrers laden with packages, bags ana
boxes of gold left the ship for what they

painful reticence and the minimizing of
the amount of gold brought out by indi
viduals it Is a doubly assured fact that
the Klondikers on the St. Paul come to
this city with substantial fortunes, rang
ing from a few thousand dollars to $luo,
000 each and more.
The clean-up of the Klondike district
Is estimated at from $10,000,000 to $25,000,000,
â with the chances largely in favor of the
latter figure, as one of the miners says
that when they left St. Michael royalty
had been paid on $20,000,000 of gold. The
Influx of people to the country has been
bo large that all claims as far as they
have been prospected have beim- staked
out, and all of them are paying the own
ers; but those who go into the country
row must either buy claims or make new
discoveries. The only creeks where dust
Is found in paying quantities are: El
Dorado, Bonanza, Dominion. Sulphur and
Hunker, Bear River and bench claims.
Nothing to speak of has been found on
their tributaries.
Tho result of the spring clean-up on
El Dorado and Bonanza creeks, while not
disappointing, luis not been equal to some
of tho extravagant predictions made last
year. On El Dorado only twenty-five
claims have been worked extensively,
while some of those on Bonanza have,
hardly p:'.iu wages. The richest claims on
El Dorado are Including between 7 and
35. Not mai.y above 45 have been worked
during the last season.
The principal claims that are being
â¢worked on Bonanza are those from 10 to
41, abeve Discovery, and from 1 to 7 be
low. However, there are quite a number
as far below Discovery as ;rr which have
received considerable attention and pay.
Dominion, Sulphur. Bear and Hunker
are said to be fine producers, and the dust
already taken out gives promise of
richer yields to follow. Dominion is
credited with being much richer than at
first reported, ar.d bids fair to be one of
the richest diggings in the country. The
gold taken out proved to be exceptionally
fine. The richest claims are those be
tween the two discovery claims.
On Little Mlnook Creek the clean up
was in excess of early estimates but fell
short on" over two-thirds of the claims
A conservative estimate of the output
taken from the creek is $260,000. Claim 8,
probably the richest, was only worked out
65 feet, and while ex -Governor John H.
McGraw and General E. M. Carr of Seat
tle decline to give figures outsiders es
timate the output at from $30,000 to 140.000.
Claim 9 worked more men and yielded
' about $100,000; numbers 5, 6 and 7 and 10
also had good clearings. All the claims
below Discovery are summer claims, so
the work has just started on them. (Jua.il.

hnvÂ«> been worked but little; enough, how
ever, that all claim owners refuse to
sell for small amounts, and are preparing
for a full winter's work.
It is said by some that Minook Creek
is putting out gold In large quantities.
but C. F. Jacobs, who owns three claims
on Little Minook. says the larger creek is
reported to bo much better than it really
Is. He sank thirteen holes without get
ting a sign of color, and Is of the opin
ion that the diggings are worthless.
Claims 7, 8 and 9 are tho best on the
crock, and they have done only moder
ately well.
TJie sale of claims is rather slow Just at
present, and this is attributed to the fact
that 10 per cent royalty was placed on
aJI sales by the Canadian Government.
It is expected that sales will be more
rapid in the winter when they begin to be
worked again. The lack or buyers has
not decreased the price in any degree, all
claims beirtg held at large figures.
Probably the most fortunate of the
claim owners of the Klondike this year
are the Stanleys of Seattle and their part
ner, Charles Warden of LÂ»>s Angeles. They
hold 25 and 26 axid a half each of 24 ana
32, on El Dorado. A portion of thoir clean
uj> was 1400 pounds of gold. It was pack
ed into Dawson from the mines on live
horses. Charles , Anderson is the lucky
owner of 2J< on El Dorado. John Lee
took $200,000 from the claim on a lay, and
ho and Anverson together bought a half
of 32 for $150,000. A good clean up was
made on 30. E! Dorxdo. by Chappel, Ale.x
McDonald's partner. It is said that Mc-
Donald is now showing an expert of the
Rothschilds about his property, and it
is generally believed that he intends to
sell out. The report Is also given credence
that "Nigger Jim" Daughtary ha.s dis-,
posed of nisinterests to a London syndi
cate for $1,500,000.
No. 26 above on Bonanza, owned by a
pool of sixteen men, has turned out very
rich.
On El Dorado Nos. 10 and 11, owned re
spectively by John Erlckson and Fr.d
Brusseth of Seattle, have had good clean
.ups.
It was expected that the St. Paul would
bring down at least $7,000,000 in gold, but
the amount only reached between $3,000,000
and $4,000,000. F. J. Hellen. one of the
passengers from Dawson, gives the fol
lowing explanation of the small amount:
"The report reached us that the river
steamer Bella, owned by the Alaska
Transportation Company, was .stuck fast
on a. bar clown the river between Circle
City and Yukon FlatÃ. All were anxious
to got out with their money early, so
took th<> N. A. T. Company a steamers
Hamilton ar.d P. B. Weare, which con
nected with the Roanoke. which left St.
Michael two days ahe,ad of us. She will j
probably have on board nearly $8,000,000 I
In dust."
It is denied that Miss Emma Kelly, the
reporter, who goes under the name of j
the "Kansas City Star," is married to
"Nigger Jim." The reported marriage Is
false, though Miss Kelly is naid to have
made every effort to capture him. She
i.s now cooking for Jack Gregory, who
owns the Discovery claim on Bircti Creek,
another good one on Mastodon, and is re
ported to be worth a million.
Nearly all of the returned Klondikers
say that those going into the country had
better take the Dyea-Skaguay route from
now on. The river is getting very low,
and boats are already getting stuck on
the bar. Some who are going to return
immediately, however, will take their
chances on" the St. Michael route.
The richest clean-up is that of X. E.
Pickott. His portion is of a varying ra-
U:rÂ«. Some place it at $J<o.ooo, but this lig- |
ure is treated with ridicule by men who
worked on the same creek. They assert
that if Pickott ha-s cleaned up a cent he
has taken out of the earth at least $200.
000. His claim is El Dorado 17, one of the
very richest on that historic creek. If
the" five boxes of gold stacked up in thu
oflice of the Commercial Hotel are any
evidence Pickott, who Is a Canadian, has
certainly been successful.
Fred Berry of much newspaper fame Is
I another of the passengers. Besides return-
I Ing with certificates of deposit represent
ing great wealth he brought down his
meed of nuggets, all in a plain pine box.
Berry's clean-up is estimated in the hun
dred thousands, but he carefully conceals
the exact amount.

whom the lens fortunate point, stands |
well up in the list. Close on to $l<K).00o
they say he has with him. Van AlstinÂ«., |
In his pugnacious way, refuses to expose
his hand, and so deep has reticence sunk
in his bosom that he even attempts to
conceal his name.
Peter Wyberd. well known in this city,
has returned with about JM.OOO. He owns
claims Ml the Bonanza and El Dorado ana
will return in the spring. According to
his way of reckoning there are millions
on millions to be dug from these creeks
and still enough gold left for a nation.

develop Into the Mcnest . gold-producing
territory in the Klondike.

H. Campbell s slated as bringing In about
300 pounds of gold.
A. P. McCella and Martin Woolsted are
rich claim holders and they brought bags
of the shining metal with them. C. B.
Roberts, a saloon man, has a few thous
and dollars that speak for the profits of
liquor in the far-off northern country.
Two women returned, christened
"Whisky Nell" and "Babe." One is sup
posed to have broiight as much as $30,000
with her. the other $20.f)00. They have
been In the Klondike regions but a short
time.
Louis Emkins is said to have sold out
El Dorado No. 7 for $l.? 0,000, all of which he
brought with him. Tommy Blake, also on
El Dorado Creek, brought about $SO,OOO
With him If reports speak the truth.
Blake is noted as a man of great liber
ality, and the way ho scattered gold dust
in St. Michael before the sailing of the
St. I'aul has won him the admiration of
his mining confreres.
D. B. Davison brought down $43,000. He
has been one of the most successful pros
pectors of the Klondike district and un
der very peculiar circumstances. He was
sent to Dawson to represent a number of
capitalists and was accompanied by a
Canadian who was treasurer of the com
pany. Davi.son was deserted by the Can
adian when the food famine struck Daw
son and was thrown on his own resources
without a penny. He worked as a day
laborer for a time until he secured a
grub stake. After staking out several
claims on Bonanza, none of which panned
out, he discovered French gulch. He
! worked his claim for a month, taking out
$30,000. and then sold It for $100,000. Mr.
Davison's richest pan yielded $340 and
; others as much as $250. The largest nug
got he mined was worth $110.
W. E. Burns, the Chicago boy, whose
feet were frozen so badly last November
that they had to be amputated brought
! about $4000 down, thanks to the good
i hearted miners. Burns after his injury
I was unable to work any, but succeeded
In staking out a claim, and together with
some partners owns interests in three or
! four. At Dawson City the miners raised
'. $3000 for the boy .and those on board the
. boat $1000 more. Jack Ales is another un
fortunate on board the boat. Ten days
after he got into the country a tree fell
j on him injuring his bnck In such a Â«san
! ner that his limbs were paralyzed.
"Buster" Walter, the champion lead dog
of the Yukon, was more delighted at
reaching shore than any other passenger.
His master. C. L. Walters, speaking for
him. said that "Buster" owned several
good claims and would have a little money
to spend in Fresno, his home.
J. H.*Johnson brought down $7000 Miss
Sadie O'Hara $3000. and Miss Locke $Â°0 -
000. A. L. Smith had about $50,000 and
D. W. Donovan 145.000. C. D. Blodgett.
who is known all over the country as
"Jim." owns Interests in five claims on
the El Dorado and Bonanza creeks, and
confessed to having $10,000 in gold with
him, but his friends think his pile lamer.
"I was the only one on board who had
no gold," said Brigadier General George
M. Randall, "but I am glad to be here.
I have been stationed at St. Michael with
the troops there. Late last month I re
ceived word on the Roanoke that I would
be made a brigadier general of volunters
and ordered to report here. On my arrival
this evening I reported to Washington by
telegraph. I have no idea where I will be
assigned, but it probably be in the East."
The scenes around the hotels which the
Klondikers patronized presented the pic
turesque In several phases. Many of the
miners came down in Klondike outtits.
They were all grizzled and showed the
wear of seasons amid snow and ice that
told of a battle with the elements. There
was little complaining. A silent satisfac
tion seemed to be the tenor of their feel
ings and an expressed intention on every
hand to return in the spring for further
tussles with the cold and hardships of tho
frozen north, where gold abounds and is
ready for the taking.

"Remembering God" was the particular
subject of his sermon and he spoke of
character as a basis for his subject,
dwelling at length, though very interest

and the eultivatoion of habits by asso

sermon the speaker pointed out that the
four essential points to be considered in
remembering God are: Our physical, in

MRS. NELSON HIS ACCUSER
CLAIMS HE ASSAULTED HER
WITHOUT CAUSE.
The Offending Patrolman Will Have

Mrs Nelson, who conducts a saloon at
iÃOin street, claims she was brutally
Ited by Policeman Frank Greenan
about 10 o'clock Saturday r.ight. Last
evening she visited police headquarters
and jr. ferred charges against the officer.

against the Baloon window, breaking it.
Alarmed by the .rash Mrs. Nelson rushed
outside and seeing the officer and his
helpless victim, who was lying on the
ralk, she asked him who was re-
Bponsibl'e f"r the dam
For a reply Greenan, Bhe claims, caught
her by the arm and threw her against the

He then knocked her down, she alleges,
and in falling her right side was consid
erably bruised by coming in contact with
the sidewalk. As she lay helpless Greenan
turned his attention to the Stanforu
woman and succeeded in dragging her to
the patrol box. After the wagon arrived

Mrs, Nelson. "Either you or the woman
whom you had under arrest broke the
window arid I want the damage repaired."
"You have a son in Ban Quentin, haven't
you?" inquired the policeman with a grin.
' try to bluff me or you will find
yourself in trouble."
Mrs. Nelson Indignantly denied that hor
son was an Inmate of the penitentiary and
df-rtvd Greenan to prove it.
"You're a â liar." declared the police
man with a show of anger. "I know he

of the officer Mrs. Nelson left him, after

PASTOR PALMER RESIGNS.
Brooklyn Presbyterian Church Will
Be Looking for His Successor.
OAKLAND, July 17.â Rev. S. S. Palmer,
pastor of the Brooklyn Presbyterian
Church, presented his resignation to th*
church this morning. This action comes
as an entire surprise, as he has refused
two calls In the past year and it was be
lieved that he would remain with his
present charge indefinitely. But it seems
no i to be. About a year ago Mr. Palmer
received a call from Springfield, Ohio, but
after considering it he decided to re
main here. Six months later came a very
fluttering call to accept a pastorate in
Honolulu. As the salary was much larger
than he was receiving It was thought tnat
he would accept, but he did not. The call
vhiri he has agreed to accept comes from
the Broad-street Church of Columbus,
Ohio, a comparatively new organization,
having been in existence only ten years.
It is tn.Â«!<rstood That the salary offered in
less tliar. he Is receiving here.
Mr. Palmer came to Oakland five year*
ago to a church rent with dissension and

Business Before the City Council.
OAKLAND, July 17.â The City Council
will meet to-morrow evening and act upon
i the proposed liquor license reduction or
dinance, the prohibitive cigarette ordi
nance an the application of the Lake Mer
ritt Sanitary Improvement Club for the
dredging of Lake Merritt and changing of
the city s sewer system so that it may not
befoul the lake. It Is believed that Coun
cilman Woodward has the deciding vote
on the first ordinance. The second may
depend largely upon the first, although
j the author of it could cause it to become
I a law by voting with those who could kill
I the first-named with Woodward's vote.
There seems little doubt that prompt ac
tion will be taken in the Lake Merritt
proposition.
Salvation Camp-Meeting.
OAKLAND, July 17.â Three thousand

* companiment of "Yankee Doodle."
The annual State camp-meeting of the
Salvation Army, which has been in ses-
I sion for three weeks, held Its closing ex
ercises at Trestle Glen to-day. This af
; ternoon there was a carnival of nations,
. and it proved to be one of the most pa
triotic demonstrations ever seen In this
city.

OAKLAND, July 17.â Policemen Pardee

so far as known no blood was shed. The
police scared the gathering away, but the
two named were overhauled and locked
up.

THE SAN FRAISTCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 18, 1898.
ALL EAGER TO
SEE CERVERA
Curious Visitors Flock to
Annapolis.
ADMIRAL ATTENDS CHURCH
NEARLY ALL THE PRISONERS
AT WORSHIP.
Give Thanks for Deliverance Prom
the Fate of Their Comrades
Who Fell Before the
Americans.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANNAPOLIS, Md., July 17.âMary
land's ancient capital was crowded to
day with curiosity seekers who came
from Baltimore, Washington and else
where by rail and by water In the
hope of getting a peep at Admiral
Cervera and the men who fought and
lost In the great naval fight off San
tiago. Those who reached here early
in the morning were rewarded for their
trouble, as nearly all the prisoners,
including the admiral, attended diviaa
services at St. Mary's Roman Catholic
Church, where they offered up thanks
for their deliverance from the fate
that overtook so many of their com
rades who fell before the fire of the
American guns. The church, which is
the only one of the Catholic denomina
tion in Annapolis, is one of the land
marks of the city and embraces in its
membership some of the most promi
nent and wealthy of Annapolis' people.
It is conducted by the Redemptorist
Brothers, is a handsome structure and
is thought to possess one of the hand
somest interiors of any religious edi
fice in the State. This morning's ser
vices were conducted by Brother John,
one of the most prominent of the
Order of Redemptorists, in the pres
ence of a congregation which taxed
the edifice to its utmost. Probably no
service held within its walls for many
years possessed so great an interest or
made a more profound impression up
on those who attended it.
At the close of the services the offi
cers returned to the Naval Academy
and spent the balance of the day in
strolling about the grounds or loung
ing on the broad piazzas which sur
round most of the buildings in which
the prisoners are quartered. They are
rapidly becoming accustomed to their
surroundings and seem cheerful and
contented. Ample provision has been
made for their comfort, their food is
plentiful and of the best quality, and
clothes will be provided for such as
will accept.
Captain Eulate of the Vlzcaya is the
only one of the officers who has thus
far refused to sign the parole pledge.
His reasons for it are that Admiral
Cervera was only required to give a
verbal promise and that his (Eulate's)
rank entitles him to the same privi
lege. The authorities here have no
doubt that the matter will be amicably
arranged and that the scruples of the
gallant officer may be overcome.

Lost Part of His Nos9.
SAN RAFAEL.. July 17.â An accident
occurred here this evening by which T.
J. Mahon, brother of Attorney E. B. Ma
hon, will probably be disfigured for life.
Mr Mahon went home this evening, and
as he stepped over the threshold of the
kitchen door, stumbled and fell. A five
gallon coal oil can lay in his path. His
nose struck the edge of the can with such
force as to sever a large part of that
member from his face. The wound bled
profusely and a physician was called
upon to stop the hemorrhage.
Bonds Included in the Special Tax.
WASHINGTON, July 17.â The Commis
sioner of Internal Revenue has held that
in estimating the amount of special tax
required to be paid by a bank, based as
the law requires, on capital and surplus,
the amount invested in United States
bonds is not to be deducted. It is held
that there is no provision of law which
warrants such deduction. Inasmuch as
the tax is not on the bonds but upon the
business of banking, the capital and sur
plus, which may include bonds, is taken
as a basis for fixing the amount of the
tax.

DIVIDED TWO
BIG STAKES
E. V. Sullivan's Dogs De
feat Speedy Rivals.
FINE SPORT AT UNION PARK
WAYFAREK LANDS THE CONSO
LATION STAKE WITH EASE.
Attendants at Ingleside Furnished
With Some Exciting Sport.
Names of the
Winners.
E. V. Sullivan, a well-known coursing
devotee, enjoyed the honor of dividing'
two large Btakea at Union Park yester
day. His entries in the open and conso
lation stakes were in splendid form and
for the first time in months showed their
Old-time speed and endurance. False
Flatterer and Royal Buck went down the
line defeating well-known dog-s with ease
and divided the open stake between them.
Electric and lied of Stone of the same
kennel landed the veteran stake and also
divided the money.
Had Sullivan's Blackatone defeated
Jester he would have finished the stake
hi the fourth round with his four dogs.
Blackstone had a lead on Jester up to
the first turn, but his paw caught In a
hole and he was thrown out of his gait.
Jester then took (he lead and worked the
hare fur many points while Rlackstone,
try as he would, could not get near the
prey.
A better day for coursing and a finer
lot of hares could not have been chosen.
The warm sunshine brought many hun
dreds to the park and belting was brisk.
The hares and hounds were also invig
orated by tin- beautiful weather and ran
with dash and vigor.
The talent had things all their own
way duri!:K the afternoon's running, suf
fering very few upsets. Rnyal Buck con
trlbuted one by defeating Minneapolis at
odds <>f -1 to 1. Lady Blanche b.at Right
Bower at 2 to l and Jester gained a flag
over Mira Monte at the same odds.
In tin- consolation stake the most dis
astrous ups< i ;<> the talent occurred when
Terrona BÂ«ccumbed to Bweet I.ips at odds
of ?â¢ to 1. Mystery created a small sur
prlse by beating Precita. In the course
between Terrona and Sweet Lips the
former showed a gr>-at burst ..f speed to
tan the prey turned back to
Lips, who quickly erased the ad
vantage gained and killed, winning a
somewhat" t!;ky course.
Old Sky! all's defeat of Vanity Fair
broughi joy to the shortenders as the
â¢ ,1 were 5 to 2.

AT INGLESIDE.
Perfect weather and one of the host
canls ever run off in the park drew to
Ingieslde yesterday the largest crowd
that has passed through thÂ»- pates this
year. Gladiator proved himself the
champion. Flying Buck was the hot fa
vorite in the long odds book and he lasted
through to the linai. But Gladiator was
then too much for him. At first they ran
an "undecided." But on the second at
tempt Gladiator ran away from the Buck.
It was a <t;iy of hot sport. None warmer
was ever seen on any park in America.
Minerva annexed the non-winner stake
and Minerva was begging at 30 to 1 when
the game began.
It was also a day for the short enders.
Hobson started, the ball rolling by sink-
Ing the Eastern crack, Ida, who ruled
over him at 3 to 2. Tom Bell put out the
2-to-5 favorite Rapid;' Victor beat the
5-to-8 favorite Rosalie; Innisfallen was
despised at 4 to 1, but was an awfully
good "1" against Sky Queen; Tullamore
Bold short at 2 to 1 against Clipper, yet
â¢won; Swinnerton did the same trick with
Koolawn, and the others were Prince
Hal beat Hotstuff (5 to 3); Gilt Edge beat
Sarcastic (3 to 1); Victor beat Dakota (5
to 3); Monitor beat Sylvia (3 to 1); Victor
beat Glen Chloe (5 to 3); Victor beat
Liberty Bell (2 to I); Hadiwist beat Mlal
mo (5 to 2), and Flying Buck sold over
Gladiator at 5 to 3 In the final.
Victor was the disastrous factor from
the talent's standpoint during the day.
In his every course he sold on the short
end yet he landed In second place to
Minerva. Minerva's victory, too, was a
surprise to the knowing ones. She is only
a puppy, yet she trotted right through
the older ranks in a manner that stamped
her of very high class.
The running in detail wÂ«s as follows:
Non-winner stakeâ D. Dowst's Sarcastic beat
Derby Kennel's Fireball; F. Murphy's Gilt
Edge beat J. kj Donnell's Las Palmar: J. Bad

BLUE RIBBONS LOST
TO THE LIVELY CRABS
DAUBENBIS PITCHED EXCEL
LENT BALL THROUGHOUT.
The Friscos Gave Another Exhibition
of Miserable Playing and Were
Easily Whitewashed.
BY JOE CORBETT.
The biggest crowd that has turned out
to witness the games at Recreation Park
this season was present at yesterday's
contest.
They came because they supposed a
good contest was to be the programme,
! for the games of late have been heralded
as being almost perfect and they cer
! tainly were up to yesterday.
When one considers that the Frlscos
1 have played about two good games all
season and that these two were the re
sult of providential aid the fact that they
made a serious mistake in expecting them
; to do something beyond themselves Is
quite evident.
They displayed, however, during yes
terday's contest a few new points which
to a "certain extent were surprising, be
cause those present thought that they
had made every conceivable misplay in
previous games.
This was the next disappointment and
we wonder what they will do next.
The Sand Crabs, their opponents and
superiors, what a grand game they did
play. It was right In order with the re
ports sent out and could hardly have been
better.
Be careful to note that the Friscos
made six errors, no runs, one hit and no
base steals. What a glorious record.

defeat with a 6 to 1 score In one of the
most stubbornly contested games of thu
season. San Jose scored in the first In
ning, but after that was unable to lo

THE SAN r FR AK CISCO CALL, MOKDAY, JULY 18, 1898.
HELD UP
NEAR THE
CLIFF HOUSE
Unusually Bold Crime
of Three Men.
A STRANGER THEIR VICTIM
DRIVE OFF WITH THE RIG
AFTER TAKING HIS MONiIY.
Dan McCarthy, a Seafaring' San,
Attacked and Robbed
on the Ocean
Beach.
While driving along the beach about
two miles south of the Cliff House yes
terday afternoon Dan McCarthy, a sea
faring man, was attacked by three men
and robbed of $40 and a gold watch.
McCarthy arrived here yesterday morn-
Ing from a cruise in Alaskan waters and
to celebrate the occasion he decided to
hire a horse and buggy and take a spin
to the Cliff House. He first went to
Barney Farley's resort and after having
several drinks drove along the beach ex
pected to meet a friend.
He had gone only a short distance when
he was suddenly confronted by his as
sailants, one of whom pretended to know
him.
While the latter was conversing with
him his companions jumped into the
buggy and struck McCarthy over the
head with some blunt Instrument.
Notwithstanding that he was partially
stunned by the blow McCarthy grappled
with his assailants and endeavored to
force them from the buggy. One of the
men at this juncture struck him a terrific
blow in the jaw, almost knocking him
out. They then dragged him from the
buggy and hurriedly took his valuables.
After robbing him the bold highwaymen
took his rig and drove it for a distance of
several miles, where they abandoned it.
Bruised and bleeding McCarthy several
hours later appeared at police head
quarters and invoked the aid of Captain
Seymour and his men in finding the rob
bers.
After obtaining a description of the men
Seymour had McCarthy taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where his wounds were
dressed by Dr. Well.
In telling his experience to the police
McCarthy *ald he first saw his assailants
when he entered Farley's resort. They
were standing behind some trees, ap
parently bent on mischief. After he left
the saloon they hurriedly walked along
the road leading to the beach. Just as he
reached the end of the road after a slow
drive he was surprised to see the three
men apparently waiting for him.
Thinking that they intended to play
some joke on him. he paid no attention to
them until one of them hailed him after
pretending to know him.
McCarthy is confident that he can iden
tify the men if they are arrested.
EDNA WILL HOLD
WALLACE TROPHY
SAQER'S SLOOP DEFEATS THE
FLAGSHIP EMBLA.
George Miller's Occident, the Pride of
the California Yacht Club, Took
Her First Cruise Yesterday.
As late as last Friday It looked as
though the event Bet down for yesterday
on the programme of the California
Yacht Club, viz., the regatta for the
Wallace trophy, would not come off. But
a race did take place after all yesterday
between E. F. Sager's sloop Edna and E.
N. Walter's sloop Embla, resulting in a
victory for the former yacht. The course
was from the narrow gauge mole to
Presidio Shoal buoy, around that and
thence back to the starting point. It was
a beat out to the buoy, with a good
breeze, on an ebb tide, and a run home.
The sloop Embla crossed the line at
8 minutes and 10 seconds after 1 p. m.,
and the sloop Edna at 11 minutes and 50
seconds past the hour. The Embla made
somewhat the best of the beat, but off the
waterfront took one unnecessary tack,
and on the run back had trouble with her
spinnaker. The Edna came in 8 minutes
and 45 seconds before the Embla, to which
are to be added 3 minutes and 40 seconds
for her later start, making her a winner
by 12 minutes and 25 seconds. Besides
this being slightly the smaller boat, she
would receive a small time allowance
from the Embla. But It was unnecess
sary to calculate this out, though in a
close contest It might make the differ
ence between victory and defeat. C. Lor-
Ing, G. turn Suden and J. Homer acted
as the officials in charge of the regatta.
The Wallace trophy was presented to
the California Yacht Club in 1896 as a
perpetuaT challenge cup by the well
known attorney. W. C. Wallace, at one
time secretary of the club. In 1596 and
1&97 It was won by Admiral E. A. yon
Schmidt's speedy cutter Whirlwind. In
ISW the Embla heat the Edna by 3
minutes actual sailing time, but on time
allowance the Edna beat the Embla 31
seconds. Besides the sloops Edna and
Embla, George Miller's new sloop Occi
dent was out for her first cruise.; she
looks a very smart boat, quick in stays
and handy. When she has erot her spars,
sails and" ballast nil properly adjusted
she should prove a fast sailer and hard to
beat. Other boats of the California fleet
out cruising were: Allen M. Clay's sloop
Sea Fox. Captain Eames' sloop Surf. G.
turn Suden's sloop Reglna, 1... S. Sher
man's sloop Royal, R. R. l'Hommedieu's
sloop Phoenicia, Carl A. Tarnberg's
sloop Mist, the sloops Hope and Flash.

AT THE PARK AND CLIFF.
Soldiers Contest in Aquatic Sports at
Sutro's Baths.
Music at the Park and Cliff House, sol
diers in aquatic sports at Sutro's Baths
and various features at the Chutes, af
forded thousands an opportunity to spend
several enjoyable hours yesterday. No
serious casualties occurred at the Park to
mar the enjoyment of the day.
Peter Lustauman was out on his wheel
and collided with a passing vehicle, the
result being that he was painfully injured.
He was taken to the Park Hospital,
where his injuries, which consisted of a
bruised nose and shoulder and a lacerated
face, were dressed, after which he
wheeled away In search of more pleasure.
Several'curlos in the way of Indian rel
ics, presented by John Daggett. and a
colonial bedstead, presented by Mrs. Mar
garet Lettich, have been added to the mu
seum, which Is fast filling up to the limit
of Its capacity.
Many soldiers from the New York regi
ment visited the Cliff House, and ex
pressed surprise at the beauty of the
scene, the seal rocks, the seals themselves,
the Farallones showing misty in the dis
tance and above all "old ocean's melan
choly gray." Many of the boys from the
New York regiment also visited the
Chutes. Among the new features at this
popular play ground is a camera obscura,
an interesting little machine placed in a
dark room, but showing the moving world
without. To-day a large troop of Japan
ese jugglers will be the feature of the
programme in the Chutes Pavilion. The
feats of the little brown men are little
short of marvelous, and they may remain
as an attraction for several" weeks.
The aquatic sports at Sutro's Baths
nave proved the best drawing card as far
as the soldiers are concerned. A large
crowd vls.ted the baths and witnessed the
lowering of at least one swimming record.
In the under-water swimming match Fred
McDermid, champion under-water swim
mer of Australia, swam 212 feet, the en
tire length of the big tank. Paul Newman
of Chicago has heretofore claimed the
record, having swum 20S feet, but he will
now have to try again. In the high diving
match A. Ramons was declared winner
and G. La Rue was awarded second prize.
A. Bodie of the Montana Volunteers won
the 100-yard handicap. J. Melrose of the
Kansas regiment second. In the spring
board diving, S. Burnett won; A. Ray
mond second. J. Rtngrose won the 120
yard handicap; S. !>a Coste second.
A TRIO OF BURGLARS.
Three Arrested in Different Parts of
the City, One Being a Soldier.
The police arrested three men yesterday
in different parts of the city on charges of
burglary. The tlrst was William Mc-
Keevers at 8 o'clock in the morning.
Thomas Assmussen, 2'M Third street, was
awakened by hearing McKeevers ran
sacking his bureau drawers and held him
till Policemen Chase and Laws made
their appearance.
The second was William Wilson, a pri
vate in Company B, Thirteenth Minne
sota Regiment. He is accused of break
ing into the saloon of Fred Fluoger at
Point Lobos and First avenues and steal
ing three bottles of whisky, two boxes of
cigars, some chewing tobacco and cigar
ettes, besides $10 from the till. He was
arrested on First avenue about 5 o'clock
In the morning by Policemen Allen and
rarrell. All the stolen property was
found on him. The police say that a
number of saloons In that district have
been broken into lately.
The . last of the trio was Matthew
Maume, who entered a vacant house at r.4
I'irst street by crawling through a trap
door in the sidewalk. He took out three
Of the windows and was walking away
with them on his shoulders when he was
arrested by Policeman Tyrell. Maume
belongs to a respectable family but Is a
slave to the liquor habit, which has kept
him prominently befor. the police for
some years.
SPAIN AND AMERICA.
Isaiah's Prophecies the Text of Rev.
Hemphill's Sermon.
"Decadent and Rising NationsâAmeri
ca and Spain Contrasted," was the sub
ject of Rev. John Hemphill's sermon at
Calvary Presbyterian Church last even
ing. The services were well attended and
the music was of the usual standard.
Rev. Hemphill took his text from the
sixtieth chapter of Isaiah, twelfth verse:
"The nation and kingdom that will not
serve Thee shall perish." He considered
these words to constitute Spain's more
recent history in a simple sentence.
Referring to the twenty-second verse
of the same chapter â "A little one shall
become a thousand and a small one a
strong nation"â the Speaker said that this
is briefly the history of America. He
showed at length that the growth and ad
vancement of our nation is borne out by
Isaiah's prophesies and that Isaiah could
not have given us the historical facts of
Spain and America more correctly than
he has done. The speaker also referred
in glowing terms- to the victories achieved
by the army and navy at Santiago. The
criticism ihat Shatter has been subjected
to he did not consider well put, for the
general met with many obstacles that are
not generally known, and while ho lusi
but several hundred men he captured
25,000 Spaniards.

Victory Due to God.
Rev. C. E. Locke of the Central Metho
dist Church in his lecture lnst night gave
all the credit of the recent victories to the
God of war and nations. He said that
inasmuch as the present war was declared
for humanity's sake and not for conquest,
and as the people with whom we went to
war are an ignorant people who would not
or rould not submit to arbitration or di
plomacy, it was God's will thai we should
go to war, and it being his will we were
bound to win.
God in his wisdom gave us President
McKlnley, Admiral Dewey. Commodore
Schley, Admiral Sampson, General Shaf
ter, and last but not least Lieutenant
Hobson. At the mention of each of those
names rounds of applause greeted them.
A Pie-Eating Contest.
An afternoon and moonlight picnic was
held yesterday at obeli Mound Park un
der the auspices of San Francisco Lodge
No.. 1 and San Mateo Lodge No. 7 of the
Journeymen Butchers. There was a fair
attendance and most of the time was
spent in dancing. A programme of races
was prepared, and everybody, from the
small boy to the fat woman, had a chance
to show their speed. Appropriate prizes
were given to the winners. The last and
most interesting feature was a pie-eating
contest. There were a number of con
testants, but the honors of winning the
first prize fell to <Jie smallest runt in the
lot. His advantage lay in his mouth,
which never missed absorbing a third of a
pie at every bite.
A Defiant Butcher.
Fred Junker, a butcher on McAllister
street, between Buchanan and Webster,
started in early yesterday morning to put
down a wooden sidewalk in front of his
shop, contrary to the ordinance. He was
arrested by Policeman Curry and gave $10
bail. He started in again ana when
Policeman Gillen remonstrated with him

CHURCH NOTICES.
"CHRISTIAN Healing" and preaching from
texts suggested by the audience, dally at 6;
two Sabbath services, at 2 and 6. by Rev.
Francis Warnon, at Mills Tabernacle,
Twelfth and Webster, Oakland. This work
of God has continued daily for three weeks,
with ever-increasing displays of divine grace
and power in saving and sanctifying, as well
as healing the sick. Many totally deaf and
blind instantly began to hear and see; tumors
and goitres disappeared; the lame ran and
leaped; eczema, neuralgia, rheumatism, etc.,
yielded; even the sick miles away restored
at the time special prayer was being made
by Mr. W. at tabernacle. This gospel work
being now on a "permanent" basis, branches
will be opened all over the Coast, to the
glory of "Jesus only." The Revs. Mess, Vir-
tue, Holm, Coplin (officer of the "Christian
Alliance"), Garvin and other ministers have
assisted at the meetings and declared the
man and his work to be surely of God. Rase
and baseless calumnies (so proven) need no
reply from Brother Warnon or his friends;
the work speaks for itself, and the man Is
loved and honored by us who "know" him.
To-day at 2 and 6, healing, etc., and testi-
monies of marvelous healings are promised by
Oakland and "Los Angeles" friends; testi-
monies of broken bones set, cancers and
tumors removed, and of a "dying person In-
stantly restored. Bring your sick.. Come early
to avoid crowding. (H. Freeman, M. D., for
the committee.)

FOUND DEAD IN HER BED WITH
A RAG TIGHTENED ABOUT HER NECK
Mrs. Sadie Carpenter Makes a Mysterious
Plunge Into the Unknown.
MURDER AND SUICIDE THEO
RIZES.
A Han Said to Be a German Baron..
Under Arrest â Tragedy of
a Fourth-Street Lodging- ,
.':V:\ House. ijf -
About three years; ago people were
Bhocked and women In the "tenderloin
district" were terrorized by the mur
derous deeds of a strangler. Several
women fell victims to his fiendish lust
for blood, and all the efforts of the po
lice to_dlscover his identity were futile.
The police are agaftn confronted with
what some believe toÂ» be the work of a
strangler, the vlctfan being also a
woman in low life.
The woman was Sadie Carpenter, who
occupied room 10 in the Hubbard House,
139 Fourth street. So far as known,
she was last seen altve Jn her room
about 11:30 o'clock Saturday night by
Joseph Yon Lochner, who occupied an
adjoining room.
Liezie Riley, who occupies room 11,
heard a noise as If some one were
moaning In room 10 about half-past 1
o'clock yesterday morning, and notified
Alphonse Prieur, th^ night clerk, that
something was wrong in room 10.
Prieur knocked on Yon Lochner's door
and roused him from his sleep. To
gether they entered room 10, and while
Prieur turned his attention to lighting
the gas Yon Lochner went to the bed
and found the woman was dead. A
piece nf calico was tied tightly round
her throat and Yon L.ochner quickly
ned It. Her face was still warm,
but her hands were cold*
Prieur notified Policeman Tuite and
the woman's body was removed to the
Morgue. About two hours later Yon
Lochner was arrested ami locked up in
the "tanks" pending an Investigation.
There Is nothing so far against him ex
cept that he is the last one who Is
known to have seen her prior to her
(Win. He was a friend of the woman,
and It is said that she was indebted to
him for many acts of kindness.
Detectives Dillon and CVDea and Po
licemen Tuite and O'Keefe were de
tailed on the case. They closely exam
ined the room, but no sign of a strug
gle could be found, nothing in the room
LAY THE CORNERSTONE OF THE YOUTHS' DIRECTORY
His Grace the
Archbishop
Acts.
The Impressive ceremony of laying the
cornerstone of the Youths' Directory was
performed yesterday afternoon by Arch
bishop Rlordan in the presence of an Im-
mense concourse of people.. The site of
the new home for friendless boys is on
Nineteenth Htre*Â»t. near Guerrero. Long
before the hour appointed for the e.xer
cises every point of vantage from which
they could be viewed was filled with spec
tators. The Beats provided in the Imme
diate vicinity of the structure were soon
filled. With the arrival of the various
societies, th 6 members of which were to
take part in the ceremonies, there were
over thirty thousand persona grouped
about the building.
Archbishop Riordan officiated In plac
ing the cornerstone and laying the mor
tar, using a Oliver trowel presented to the
Rev. D. O. Crowley by William Broderlck.
The people stood with bared heads dur
ing the ceremony. A grand chorus sang
â¢â¢Hear Us! O Father!" Thia was es
pecially arranged for the occasion by J.
W. McKenzle, and was from "Cavalleria
Rusticana." Miss Minnie Powell was so-
loist.
With Archbishop Riordan, who was in
full canonicals, were a number of acolytes
In Buxplloe and cassock, and the following
being disarranged. When found by
Yon Lochner the woman was lying in
bed dressed In the wrapper she always

her sides.
Captain Seymour had a talk with Yon

It was originally planned that the Rev.
J. Prendergast, V. G., should deliver the
address of the day. At the eleventh
hour he was taken ill. and Father Con
nolly of St. Paul's took his place. He
spoke without preparation, but his heart
was so full of his subject that he enter
ed upon his discourse readily. He held
the attention of the vast throng to; the
end. being frequently Interrupted with
applause. In part he spoke. as follows:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, JULY 18, 1898.
but thought it advisable to hold him till
a complete Investigation was made. The
captain is inclined to the theory that the
woman committed suicide.
Yon Lochner says he had known the
woman for about four years. He had
been a friend to her, but that was all.
She had received a letter from a friend
Saturday morning containing a medal.
The pin of the medal had become loose
and he took the medal and pin with him
to get them fixed.
"I got home shortly after 11 o'clock last
night," he said, "and Mrs. Carpenter's
room door was partly open. I went in
and gave her the medal. She talked a
little about her friend George, who had
sent it from Chlckamauga, and then com
plained of not feeling well. She was pre
paring a poultice when I entered and
after she had gone to bed I bade her good
night and left the room, closing the door,
which had a spring lock, after me.
"I went to bed and was awakened after
1 o'clock by the night clerk, who told me
there was something wrong with 8adlÂ«.
He went and got the key and we en
tered the room. He turned on the gas
and I went straight to the bed. 1 shook
her twice and then I noticed the rag
round her neck, which I tore off. She
to educate the boy or girl. There Is no
other place its equal. Almighty God found
ed It and Christ made the marriage tie In
dissoluble for the protection of tha children.
The Youtb-' Dlrectcy Is intended to Fup
ply the place of home for poor boys who
through the fault of parents have been
deprived of that blessed haven. The ma
jority are sent from home when the de
mon of drink enters It. Thoy are cast
upon society without the protection either
of father or mother. The boy deprived of
a Christian home appeals strongly to the
heart of man. That man Is devoid of man
hood who would remaJn passive when he
could relieve the sufferings of a little boy
wandering about a city, with no future
before him except one of crime aaC
wretchedness.
SocUtr Is responsible and le bound to
supply the remedy. We must take an In
terest In homeless aM neglected boys. The
Youths' Directory hus done this In the paHt,
Is doing It now and In the time to come
will be still more useful, as the ceremony
to-day foretells. It will then be tenfoM
what It le now, especially If you take an
earnest, practical Interest In it.
The speaker then sketched briefly the
history of the Directory from its origin.
He epoke- of the scope of the work, em
bracing, as It does, boys of all creed 3, all
nationalities. He explained that no ef
fort was made nor would it be tolerated
to interfere with the religious belief of
even one little child. He eulogized Father
D. O. Crowley for his unselfish work on
behalf of the institution. He praised
Archbishop Riordan for his interest in
the workings of the home and thanked
the various societies for their support.
A feature of the ceremony was the
procession of over 5000 representative
members from the various Catholic so
cle-ties throughout this city, Oakland and
Alameda. Its purpose, in addition to com
memorating the ceremony that immedi
ately succeeded It, was to emphasize the
progress the Youths' Directory has made
Since its inception years ago by march-
Ing from the first and original home and
shelter for unfortunate waifs at Tenth
and Howard streets past the present
home to the site of the new structure on
Nineteenth Btreet.
The place of formation was Immedi
ately in front of St. Mary"s Cathedral on
Van Ness avenuo and O'Farrell street.
The line of march before the procession
passed the old structure on Tenth street
extended along Van Ness avenue to Mar
ket street, to Tenth and thence directly
to Howard.
Accompanying each society was a band,
led by the president and aids on horse
back.
was dead, but her face was still warm,
although her hands were cold.
Yon Lochner was a lieutenant in the
German army during the Franco-German
war and his friends say that he is a
baron in his own right. He receives a
pension of $370 per year from the Ger
man Government. lie is a widower, hav
ing a son employed as a plumber in this
city. He came here in I$7G and was for
some time employed by C. Ehmann, a
photographer on Fourth street. His
friends say that he was never known to
be in trouble before.
The one roomer in the house who seems
to hold the key to the situation is Mrs.
Lizzie Rlley, but the police doubt her
story. Her room is No. 11. adjoining thÂ«
onÂ© in which the dead woman was found,
Mrs. Riley's story runs as follows: "I
was awakened out of a sleep after X
o'clock this morning by a scuffling noise,
which I could not at first locate. It
seemed to come from overhead at first,
but when fully awake I discovered It to
be In the room next to mine, the one oc
cupied by Sadie. This noise soon ceaseu
and gave way to a peculiar scraping
sound, like a spool of cotton running over
the floor. This continued some twenty
minutes. I became very nervous and was
determined to see what was the matter,
when the door of Sadie Carpenter's room
opened and then was closed with a bang.
I heard footsteps of some man who worw
shoes that creaked going through the hall
and down the stairs to the street.
"After that I jumped up and opened my
door, went out in the hall and called tno
night clerk. He came with great reluc
tance.. I then told him that something
was wrong in number 10. He woke up
When the first distant sound of the
drum was heard announcing the advance
of tho procession hundreds of people col
lected In front of the old building on
Tenth street and crowded the sidewalks
along the entire line of march. As the
first column advanced Into Tenth street
from Market a loud cheer rose from the
maws of humanity In front of the old
home and was renewed at frequent inter
vals until the last banner waa lost to
view In the distance.
It was an impressive spectacle to see
the little army advancing with banners
of the various religious fraternities
flaunting and waving above the thous
ands In line. Coupled with and carried
abreast, forming a background to the
white and varied colored banners, were
the stars and stripes, which were in
variably associated with every fraternal
banner raised in Indication of the society
represented.
The entire procession was led by
Thomas R. Bannerman, assisted by his
several aids. The order of march was as
follows:

Mrs. Riley did not know the deceased
very well. She says that Mra. Carpentei
was secretive, reserved and attended to
her own affairs with a Jealous care. Mr*.
Riley heard several people enter her room
during the evening. The last one who
guinea admittance to her knowledge was
a heavy-set German. This was about 9
o'clock. She heard Mrs. Carpenter say
good-night to him a half hour later as
she escorted him to the door. Mrs. Riley.
of all the roomers, was the only one who
gained a slender confidence of the dead
woman. Bhe says that Mrs. Carpenter
mentioned to her a few days ago certain
fears of being strangled by some person
who had once before threatened hef life.
The rooms of Lochner and Mrs. Carpen
ter adjoin, with a door between. Accord
ing to the statement o< one in the employ
of ttte house this door was seldom locked.
On Mrs. Carpenter's side there are two
screw eyes, through which a aurling-iron
was run. This was found in place when
the body was discovered.
The statement of Mrs. Riley of bearing:
what she thought was a scuffle In Mrs.
Carpenter's room Is partly borne out by
the appearance of the deaa woman's faoe,
which would lead to the Impression thai
she did not die without a struggle. On
the left side of the face Just below the
ear is a mark of a finger nail, and on the
right side of the nose close to the eyÂ«
there is another distinct mark of a fln
fÂ©r nail which drew blood that flowed
own the side of the nose into the nos
tril. There is also a large abrasion or. the
left knee and a smaller one a little below
It, both having the appearance of being
freshly made. Policeman O'Keefe also
noticed that when he first saw the body
In the room there was a red mark on the
throat.
These are against the suicide theory,
and there are other things. The woman
had nearly $1300 to her credit In the HJ
bernla Bank, so that poverty was not
staring her in the face. She had an ofter N
of marriage as soon as she got a divorce
from Carpenter, If nhe felt so inclined, and
she had a pleasant home with her parents
and children In Monterey waiting her al
ways.
It was first reported that robbery was
the cause of the strangling as no money
was found in her room, but that Is ac
counted for by the fact that she banked
all that she could spare. The last de
posit made by her was $25 on July 6.
If Mrs. Riley Is to be believed, and there
Is apparently no reason to doubt her,
there was a man In room 10 shortly before
the woman was found dead, and It is
within the rangÂ© of probability that he
was the man who had once before threat
ened her life. It Is, however, strange that
no screams were heard.
According to papers found In the dead
woman's room her maiden name was
Sadie Anderson, and she was married }n
Chariton, lowa, on February 28, 1884, to
J. Mark Simpson, who is now in South
Dakota. She was divorced from Simp
son about eighteen months ago and last
December married Henry S. Carpenter, a
shoemaker at 401 Tenth street, Oakland.
The marriage took place at her parent's
home in Monterey, where her two chil
dren by her first marriage, two girls, one
13 years of age and the other 10, are liv
ing. She did not live long with Carpenter
as she had occupied the room at 139
Fourth street since last Christmas.
Several letters were found among her
papers from Carpenter, the last sent from
Lathrop on April 12. couched In affection
ate terms and telling her that he had got
a nice house for his business and wanting
her to go to him and start a millinery
store. He called upon her at her room
about six weeks ag<*>. so the police say.
There were also several letters from
Sergeant George GUT. "an of Company F.
Fifth Regiment Michigan Volunteers, at
Chickamauga. The last was dated July
10 and he called himself her "future hus
band" and spoke of the happy time they
would have when they got married after
thf war was over. It was from him she
got the medal referred to by Lochner.
