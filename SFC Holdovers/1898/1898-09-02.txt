SPECULATION AS

Peculiar Circumstance.
PARTS. Sept. 2.â There is a plentiful
supply of rumors in connection with
the Dreyfus case. The first of these is
that Dreyfus is; dead, no letter having
been' received'.; from him for some
Weeks. Another report is that CJeneral
Boiadeffre, who. has just resigned the
post of chief of the general staff, has
committed suicide. Both these rumors
are without foundation.

Speculation is Keenest over the mo
tives for Colonel Henry's suicide.
Looking to the view the whole nation
has adopted regarding the guilt of
Dreyfus, it is argued that Henry may
have supposed lie was acting in the
country's interest, even in forging the
letter, which would satisfy the nation
of the Justice of the sentence without
the production of the real evidence,
which would be undesirable onthehigh
est political grounds. In that case
Henry might have posed as a martyr
to misguided patriotism.
The tradition of the Intelligence De
partment, which at the time of the con
demnation of Dreyfus was under a con
spicuous anti-Semite, Colonel Sandherr,
would probably have led a blunt mind
like Lieutenant Colonel Henry's to con
strue the slightest hint from above of
the desirability of killing off the anti-
Dreyfus agitation into an order to do
so by any means-
Colonel Sandherr, who was then suf
fering from an incipient paralysis,
Seems to have been the head of a gen
eral conspiracy to hunt Jewish officers
out of the French army. Dreyfus, a
man of haughty demeanor but of vast
strategic knowledge, would naturally be
selected as a victim of these machina
tions. '" .;. . . â¢â  . . ' â¢-.. :â¢â¢.-â  â .
It is asserted that Cplonel Sandherr's
last day? were haunted by fear,
amounting to terror, lest the illegal and
flippant nature of the evidence upon
which ; Captain Dreyfus \yas condemn
ed should/ be revealed and weaken the
prestige of the Intelligence Depart
ment, and that he enjoined upon Henry,
his subordinate, to guard the depart
ment's traditions at all costs. ';"'.â¢â¢â 
The carelessness of the authorities in
allowing Henry' to have a. razor and In
not watching him is generally inter
preted as connivance, and, perhaps, as
persuasion, since officers under arrest
and ijkeljMo be condemned should, ac
cording to military regulations, be con
stantly watched, white Lieutenant
Colonel Henry was . left hours alone
and allowed to lock the door oh each
side. If there were persuasion it is riot
likely to have t>ee:n difficult. Had
Henry: been expelled from the army
both himself and wife would have lost
ail pension rights. As it is the Widow
becomes entitled to a handsome, pen
sion. This seems a mere likely motive
than the explanation based upon th*
alleged incoherent letter he left be
hind stating that he had lost his rea
son.
Having died uncondemned his re
mains are entitled to military honors,
but his brother will take the bo.dy to
Pough, near Chalons, where it will be
buried on Saturday with the strictest
prrvacy.
Several officers of the general staff,
it is said tcr-night, have asked to be
sent back to their regiments. General
Renouard, the new chief of staff, is un
derstood to have a free hand and to be
at liberty to replace all the staff officers
if he thinks fit. It is expected that he
will resort to a process of purification.
The Government's position ia. most
unhappy. Notice of interpellations in
the Chamber of Deputies multiply.
President Faure is rensured for leaving
Paris at such a, critical moment. Great
efforts are being made to get the sig
natures of a majority of the Deputies,
which is a necessary- preliminary to a
convocation of the chamber. ' .:â  "
The movement in favor- of a revision
in the Dreyfus case is growing by leaps
and bounds. Considering recent events
Major Count Esterhazy retains an
amazingly cool, attitude. In the course
of an interview yesterday he expressed
astonishment that Lieutenant Colonel
Henry, was allowed <to . have a razor.
Henry's death, he said, was regretable,

lations to T make," ;.: - : \, '.* :-"-; .' '*!â ; ; -"*Â°''

THE SWEEPING CHARGES
MADE BY EMILE ZOLA
PARIS, Sept. I.â M. Emile Zola, in
his famous "I accuse" letter, which led
to his trial and conviction on the
charge of libeling military officers,
said:
"I accuse Lieutenant Colonel Paty dv
Clam of having been the diabolical
worker of a Judicial error, unconscious
ly, I am ready to believe, and of then
having defended his nefarious doings
for the past three years by the most
absurd and culpable machinations. I
accuse General Mercler (who was Min
ister of War when Dreyfus was tried)
of being the accomplice, at least
through weak intelligence, In the
greatest Iniquity of the century. I ac
cuse General Billot (Minister of War
during the late Dreyfus agitation) of
having in his hands the certain proofs
of the Innocence of Dreyfus and of
having suppressed them, thus hav
ing rendered himself guilty of treason
against humanity and justice for a po
litical reason and In order to save the
compromised staff. I accuse General
Boisdeffre (the: chief of the general
staff) and General Gonz (the assist
ant chief of the general staff) of being
accomplices in the same crime, the one
through religious animosity, the other,
perhaps, through the esprit de corps;,
which makes the War Office a sacred
and unassailable ark. I accuse Gen
eral de Pellieu and Major ftavary of
having made a flagitious Investigation,
whereby I mean an inquiry of: the
most monstrous partiality. 1 accuse
the three experts in handwriting,. th 6
men Belhornme, Varienard and Couard,
of having drawn up false, and fraudu
lent reports, unless a medical examina
tion shall prove them, to be victims of
a disease of sight or judgment. I ac
cuse the officers of the War Office of
having organized a press campaign in
order to lead public opinion astray.
Finally, I accuse the first court-martial
: of having condemned a; man. on a doc
ument kept secret; and I. accuse the:
second court-martial of having covered
this illegality by order . and of com
mitting, in its turn, the crime of know
ingly acquitting a guilty person." .
After a long trial in February M;.
Zola was sentenced to one year's im
prisonment and to pay a fine of 3000
francs for these alleged libels, and M..
Perrieux, manager of the Aurore, was
sentenced to four months' imprison
ment and to pay 3000 francs fine. On
his way to and from the court house
during the trial M. Zola was continu
ally hooted by mobs, and at its conclu
sion narrowly escaped personal vio
lence. When the French author heard
the verdict he exclaimed: "They are
cannibals."
ACTED "SOLELY FOR THE
GOOD OF THE CAUSE"
PARIS, Sept. 1.-r-The Minister of War.
this afternoon received in audience
General Renouard, director of the Mil
itary College, who has accepted; the
office of chief of -the general staff, va
cant owing to the resignation of Gen- .
eral Boisdeffre. The latter bid fare
well to the officials, of his bureau this
morning.
Colonel Henry left letters addressed
to the Minister of War and General
Boisdeffre in which he protested that
he had not realized the gravity of the
act which he committed "solely for the
good of the cause."
The medical exami#Ltion made of the
remains of the late Colonel Henry
shows that his JsÂ»;!!, ..^ instanta

home at Havre this afternoon.
BOISDEFFRE IN HIGH
FAVOR AT ST. PETERSBURG
PARIS, Sept. I.â General Boisdeffre,
chief of the general staff of the French
army, who has just resigned, is under
stood to be In high fa\-or at St. Peters
burg. He gained considerable popular
ity by his attitude in defense of thft
army during the Zola, trial, and at one
time was looked upon as possibly aim
ing at a military dictatorship! :
Prince Henry of Orleans, who is cred
ited with hoping for a military.move
ment against the French republic,; also
tried to make capital out of the' trial.
He showed himself dally in the hall of
the court house and one day embraced
Major Esterhazy, another of the
French officers implicated in the scan
dal, crying: "Vive l'armee," which
aroused enthusiasm among his Orlean
ist friends, but which did not otherwise
excite the crowd present to any degree.

AGED VETERANS
Abbott Kinney Would Prevent In
mates of the Veterans' Home
From Voting.
LOS ANGfeLES, Sept. I.â Abbott Kinney of Santa Monica, a Dem
ocratic candidate for United. States Senator to succeed Senator White,
to-day filed papers in an action entitled Abbott Kinney vs: Thomas E.
Newlin, County Clerk of Los Angeles County, and Theodore Denmire,
Charles F. Groff, William J. Ladd, E. L, de Haven arid George: M 7 D.
Shingle, inmates of the Sr/ldiers' Home at Santa Monica. The action is
alleged: to be brought for the purpose of determining the right of
the inmates of the Soldiers' Home to vote in Los Angeles County, and
the complaint asks that the names be canceled and remo^-ed from the
great register of the county. . '"â â .'â 
The issue involves over 2000 qualified voters of Los Angeles County
residing at the Soldiers' Home, and the plaintiff contends that the in
mates of the home are subject to the rules and articles of war and
under the same military government as if they were in the army of
the United States.
The Republican County Central Committee will defend the action
In court, and, If necessary, associate counsel will be furnished by the
State Central Committee.
The Democrats of Los Angelea County have for years contended
that the inmates of the home have no legal residence in the county,
but the party managers have been fearful of meeting the issue. The
County Committee at one time instructed Senator White to bring legal
proceedings to determine the question, but he failed to do so, and the
whole matter has rested until the present suit was filed.

Governor Budd Expresses His
Preference to the War De

Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, Sept. 1.
The duty of selecting volunteer regiments to be mustered out of
the service is now engaging the attention of the War Department.
Yesterday the Secretary of War telegraphed to Governor Budd of
California, asking the Governor to indicate his prefernce as to what
California regiment should be first mustered out.
The information is obtained to-night from a source deemed au
thentic that the Governor replied by wire, stating that he preferred
that the Eighth Regiment of Volunteers, Colonel Park Henshaw,
should be retained.

His Own Fighting.
Special Dispatch to The Gall.
KEW YORK, Sept. I.â The Herald's
Camp Wlkoff correspondent sends the
following: General Shafter, when I
talked with him to-day, was sitting In
front of his tent in the detention camp
in a chair, to which the adjective
V commodious" scarcely does Justice.
"General," I said, "can you tell me
something about the trouble between
General Miles and Secretary Alger?
You have been made a part of It. for
It is said while the Secretary of War
pent an order to you in Santiag-o, tell
ing you you were in supreme command,
eral Miles had orders to take
charge?"
"Well," replied the general, "I really
am back in ancient history yet. I
scarcely think about this matter or
trouble, as you call it. I never heard
much about the whole affair until about
two hours ag"o, when the substance of
it was shown to me by a member of my
. who gave me several newspapers.
â  My tirst knowledge that anything
was paid to be going wrong between
Secretary Alger and General Miles was
received from an afternoon newspaper
that was brought to me on board the
ship yesterday, I saw a paragraph
that Indicated that there was some sort
mtest between the acting com
mnnding general cff the army and the
tary :' War and 1 was consider
ably surprised. I intend to look up the
facts carefully and thoroughly go over
the whole case as far as I am interested
in it and I pee they have put me in it
large extent. I shall inform my
s well as possible and as quickly
possible on the question at issue,
tiien I shall know Just how to act."
A "Will you make a statement then,"
I asked, "with reference to the rela
tions between yourself and General
Miles at Washington before you started
for Cuba and at Santiago and about
General Alger's orders to you and Gen
eral Miles?"
"That's a question that I cannot very
well answer till I get at the facts. I
lly think I shall get into the con
troversy before the public I am a firm
believer in the principle that every man
Fheuld do his own fighting. I think I

NEW YORK, Sept. I.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: Agulnaldo's ap
peal to the powers to recognize the in
dependence of the Philippine republic
or the belligerency of the insurgents
causes no concern in administration
circles. No expectation is entertained
that any â  power, either in the east or
Europe, will give consideration to Agui

I talked to-day pointed out that all the

"Had any such interference b*en con
templated." he said, "it would- have oc
curred before the protocol was signed

such interference." â¢','':
Rear Admiral Dewey, I was told to
day, is not of the opinion that the
United States should keep all of the
Spanish islands in the far east, but
should be modest in its demands.. It
was. authoritatively "announced at the

HAVANA, Sept. I.â Nothing could
be further from the truth than to as
sume that an easy problem confronts
us in the pacification of Cuba and the

SCHLEY OR HOWISON WILL
SUCCEED ADMIRAL MILLER.
NEW YORK, Sept. I.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
telegraphs: Appreciating the necessity of soon detaching Rear Ad
miral Miller from command of the Pacific station on account of his
early retirement, orders have been given by the Navy Department
directing the gunboat Bennington to proceed to Honolulu to relieve
the Philadelphia, which has been ordered to proceed to San Fran
cisco. The Philadelphia will undoubtedly be retained as the flag
ship of the Pacific station. The successor of Rear Admiral Miller
has not been selected by the department, but Rear Admiral Schley's
name is prominently mentioned in gossip in circulation at the de
partment. It is not believed, however, that Rear Admiral Schley
will desire the post, in which event Commodore H. I>. Howison, as
senior officer without sea service, n his present grade, will be eligi
ble for appointment. It is proposed by the department to event
ually increase the Pacific squadron by the addition of a battleship.
thing to lose â among those who had j
property and have at least been able '
to cling to their own homes in the â 
withering storm of Spanish oppression
âamong the Cubans and Spaniards of !
that class alike there is an ardent de
sire to see speedy annexation to Amer
ica under strong army occupation in ;
preference to a temporary protectorate j
with the Cuban Government as an ul- j
timate result.
Now that I am allowed ashore and
have had an opportunity of inquiring
I am only more convinced that annexa
tion Is undoubtedly the preference of
all who represent the wealth and in
dustry of the desolated island. It is
true, indeed, that comparatively few
of those who actively sympathized with
or participated in the insurrection have
yet found their way into this city, but
It has been possible to gain an ade
quate idea of their feelings from those
thoroughly familiar with their alms
and the conditions under which they
sought them.
American tobacco dealers, without ex
ception, assert the entire unanimity of
all with whom they have come in con
tact in the preference for absolute dom
ination of equitable Anglo-Saxon Amer
ican principles to replace the crooked
and corrupt methods of defeated Spain
rather than an unstable government of
Latin impulsiveness, as disastrously
exemplified in Spanish-American re
publics, with their constant insecurity
and ever-recurrent revolutionary ef
forts.
From all that can be ascertained, the
opposition to annexation, avowed by
those Cubans who have nothing to lose
by further disorder, thanks to the rob
bery and corruption of Spanish rule in
peace or the sacrifice of Cuban patri
otism in war, arises rather from a mis
interpretation of its meaning and a
devotion to a long cherished dream
than from any proper conception of
the comparative material advantages
of American or Cuban rule.
It seems now that, given genuine
autonomy, similar to that of Canada oY
Australian colonies, Cubans of the
most irreconcilable type would wel
come union to the United States under
a condition which left them their own
flag and their own country intact, un
der the sovereignty of. Washington,
little more than, nominal, yet far simp
ler and safer as a guarantee of perma
nent peace and security than any. mere
protectorate avowedly undertaken for
the moment only.. This there can be lit
tle doubt would satisfy also those
Spanish and Cuban repre entatives
of business interests . who threaten a
hegira in the event of unalloyed Cuban
independence as a result of a tempo
rary protectorate.
CONSIDINE TALKS OF
CORBETT-M'COY FIGHT
NEW YORK, Sept. I.â George F. Con
eldlne says that the Corbett-McCoy fight
will probably be set for October 15,
though It might take place earlier.
"How about the story telegraphed from
San Francisco to the effect that Corbett
would insist upon its postponement until
November 1?" he was asked.
"Well, I don't think it came from Cor
bett," was the reply. "McCoy and the
officiate of the Hawthorne Club have
shown a disposition to act very decently
in arranging the date of the fight to suit
Corbett, and if Jim asked for a postpone
ment he would simply be taking advan
tage of a suggestion which came from
them."

NEARLY THREE MILLIONS
THE UNION IRON WORKS MAY
GET A CONTRACT.
To the Enterprise of the Successful
San Francisco Builders Is Due
the Lse of Water Tube
Boilers.
Special DiÂ«pateh to ThÂ« Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, Sept. 1.
a notable feature in the bjds for con
structing battleships opened to-day is
a feather in the cap of the Union Iron
Works of San Francisco. The plans
submitted some time ago by : Engineer-:
in-Chief Melville involved the use of
water tube boilers, but as these would
cause a change of trim his plans were
rejected. His plans also provided for
an increase in speed and in radius of
action, but the necessary increase
space was secured by reducing that al
lowed for coal. As there was opposi
tion to increasing the size of ships
these plans were also rejected.
It was, of course, practically certain
that if any of the builders offered de
signs of their owii for greater speed
and radius of action, without any de
crease in the amount of coal carried,
water tube boilers would be used. The
alternative designs submitted by the
Cramps/which are for vessels that will
be duplicates of the Russian ship there
building, provide for the use of Ni
clausse boilers. While this will be the
first use (if these plans are adopted)
of water tube boilers in battleships of
the United States navy, It is not the
first use in armored vessel of the navy,
as the Monterey has had water tube
boilers of the Ward type ever since she
was built in XB9O, where they have
given excellent account of themselves.
It is recalled that when bids for the
Monterey were received the Cramps
were nominally the lowest bidders, but
it was only with certain changes in
the Government specifications, and
with a distinct refusal to guarantee a
performance of the water tube boilers.
The Union Iron Works of San Fran
cisco, which built the Monterey, re
ceived the contract because they were
willing: to guarantee the working of the
water tube boilers, so that this firm
really deserves the credit, as far as
builders are concerned, for being the
first to install water tube boilers in an
armored vessel of our navy.
.Four firms offered bids for the three
new battleships authorized by the last
Congress. The lowest bid of each for
any type of one vessel follows: New
port News Shipbuilding Company,
Newport News, Va., $2,580,000; Cramps,
Philadelphia, $2,650,000; Union Iron
Works, San Francisco, $2,674,000; Dia
logue & Co., $2,840,000.
The detailed bid of the Union Iron
Works follows: One ship under class
1. for $2,674,000, in 31 months; one ship
under class 2, with a speed of 17 knots,
for $2,725,000, In 31 months; one 12,200
j ton, 18 knots, in 33 months, for $2,899,
000. The act of Congress allows the
[ department to make an allowance of
not to exceed 4 per cent In favor of the
Pacific Coast bidders, so that brings
their bid within line. In the case of
the 18-knot ships, both Cramp and the
Union Iron Works submitted similar
plans. The Newport News' bid for
the 18-knot vessel is original with
them. If it should not be satisfactory
to the department, then the Cramps
would probably get two of the ships
The bids have been taken under- ad
visement by Acting Secretary Allen.

RAPID GROWTH OF
THE PENSION LIST
Last Year's Outlay Exceed
ed That of Any Four Years
Since the War.
WASHINGTON, Sept. I.â The forthcoming annual report, of the
Commissioner of Pensions will show that . the number of pensions
allowed during the past fiscal year, including the war of 1812, was
56,737, of which 54,852 were for soldiers and 1885 for sailors.
The number of pensioners on the rolls June 30, 1898, was 993,714;
amount paid for pensions during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898,
5144,651,879"; average value of each pension, 1131 79.
Comparison shows that more pensions for services in the War of
the Rebellion were granted during the last fiscal year than were al
lowed during the entire four years of Granfs second term and the
entire administration of President Hayes; that the amount actually
paid for army and navy pensions during the fiscal year ending June
30, 1898, was largely in excess of the amount paid either during the
first or second term of President Granfs administration and almost
as much as was paid during the entire four years of President
Hayes' administration.

the campaign their county committees met and agreed to terms of i

there was such a party on earth as the Populists, and the memory j

and the two committees have been wrangling ever since as to who was i
the simon-pure fusion legislative nominee. When Wetmore refused to i
come down, on the ground that he received his nomination in a con- !

STOCKTON, Sept. I.â Sheriff Tom
Cunningham retires at the first of the
year after having served continuously
in his present office for twenty-eight
years. His record as a peace officer
is too well known to require comment.
Much speculation has been indulged
In since the veteran announced he
would not run again as to what he
would do with hip valuable museum of
articles connected with the history of
many of the greatest crimes on this
coast. The museum occupies one en
tire room In the Courthouse. Every
thing from a counterfeiter's layout to
a coat of mall, worn by a Mexican ban
dit, may be found there. All told there
are 900 weapons or articles connected
with crime. Besides this Cunningham
has a "rogues' gallery" declared by
many officers to be better than the one
at San Quentin. On this he has spent
$10,000 of his own money during his in
cumbency, buying photographs of
criminals in all parts of the country re
gardless of expense.
The entire affair is the personal
property of the Sheriff, and he to-day
answered the frequent Inquiry as to
what he would do with the property by
saying he would present it to the
county, to be managed not by his suc
cessors, but by the Board of Supervis
ors as trustees of county property. The
peace officers of the State will readily
recognize the value of Cunningham's
collection and the generous nature in
which he will dispose of it.
DROWNED WHILE TRYING

Lieutenant Morgan of the Engineer

Like True Heroes.
SAVANNAH, Ga.. Sept. I.â Lieutenant
H, 8. Morgan, United States Engineer
Corps in charge of the fortification work
on Tybee Island, and Henry Smith, a
regular, were drowned in Calabogue
Sound Wednesday afternoon In an effort
to rescue the crew of the ill-fated Nor
wegian bark Noe, which went ashore and
was lost on Daufauskie beaSh. They had
reached the rim of breakers in front of
the wreck, when a tremendous sea came
down on their boat, swamping it.
All were thrown into the sea but man
aged to regain the boat. Morgan was In
his uniform and wore a heavy mackin
tosh. Although a good swimmer he was
weighed down with clothing and sank.
A moment later he reappeared and seised
the boat, but was torn loose by a wave
and disappeared. A few minutes later
Smith met the same fate.
Morgan was a West Pointer and was
assigned to the work In the Savannah dis
trict as assistant to Captain C. E. Mll

GATHERING OF
THE IRRIGATORS
Opening of the Congress
at Cheyenne.
COAST DELEGATES DELAYED
STUDYING WATER STORAGE IN
A WASHOUT.
Governor Richards' Entertaining Ad
dress of Welcome â List of
Permanent Officer*
Elected.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHEYENNE. Wyo.. Sept. I.âDele
gates to the National Irrigation Con
gress continue to come In, but the bulk
of them will arrive this afternoon and
to-night. Indications all point to a very
successful meeting. Cheyenne's pretty
little opera house is tastefuly decorated
with the products of irrigation in
Wyoming.
It was learned this morning that a
bad washout on the Southern Pacific
would delay the arrival of the Cali
fornia, New Mexico and other delega
tions froms the Southwest at least one
and perhaps two days. Nevertheless,
the congress was called to order by
President J. M. Carey at the hour
scheduled.
An entertaining address of welcome
was given by Governor Richards, who
briefly outlined the work which the
congress might take up. Irrigation on
a small scale, he said, had always been
successful, but large Investments of
capital, backed up by scientific skill
and strong hope, had not yet succeeded
in paying a dividend. The reason for
this must be determined by these gath
erings of irrigators, for all the waters
of the smaller streams were already
appropriated. Land was exceedingly
plenty and the water In the larger
streams had as yet hardly been
touched. The problem was one In
volving not only the settlement of the
arid West, but was one of great inter
est to the more densely populated
East, which must have an outlet for its
surplus population.
The following permanent officers were
elected: President, Joseph M. Carey,
Wyoming; first vice president, Dr. S.
B. Young, Utah; second vice president,
S. A. Cochran, South Dakota; third
vice president, S. M. Knox, Illinois; O.
A. McCutcheon, Michigan, national lec
turer; G. H. Maxwell, California, as
sistant national lecturer; Frank Bond,
Cheyenne, Wyo., press clerk.
President Carey then delivered a very
instructive address and thanked the
convention for the honor conferred
upon him. Professor Beeman of Cali
fornia was elected assistant minute
and recording clerk.
MRS. STANFORD A PEACEMAKER
By a Personal Visit to Vina She Al
lays a Threatened Labor Riot.
VINA, Sept. I.â Mrs. Stanford visited
Vina recently on account of labor trou
bles on Stanford ranch. She is now at
Palo Alto, attending the opening exer
cises of the university.
Superintendent Q. M. Downs reports
that the work of p.^ning grapes is pro
ceeding smoothly and that he has all the
help required. There are now about 400
men employed on the ranch, a fifth of
whom are Chinamen. There was some
trouble at first in securing white men at
60 cents a day, out of which the men
were required to pay their Sunday board.
The men kept quitting and the numerous
complaints brought Mrs. Stanford here.
The wages were afterward raised to 75
cents a day and board for the entire
week, and now more men are applying
than can be employed. This year the
crop will amount to about 800 tons of
grapes, a fourth of which has now been
picked.
There was a fire on the ranch ten days
ago which destroyed 200 tons of hay,
plows, cultivators, harrows and all the
vineyard implements. It was believed
by many that this fire was the work of
white men who had been dissatisfied with
their emproyment with Chinese in pick
ing grapes. A number of Chinese houses
were located near by and it was probably
hoped they would burn, but they did not
do so.
.Vina is very quiet and orderly. Hard
ly .a man is to be seen on the streets at
10 o'clock to-night and there Is nothing
to indicate a strike or trouble of any
kind.

READVILLE, Mass., Sept. I.â On the

again tried for a world's record of a mile
in harness, but failed to equal his per
formance by half a second.
The enormous crowd saw a mile in less
than two minutes, and It is safe to say
that with slightly different conditions the
reword would have again been broken. Ah
hour before . Pointer came out it rained
softly for a few minutes, and when, ati
o'clock, McCleary drove on the track, the
drops were still coming down. The track,
however, was in good shape, and there
was no wind.
. With a running mate Pointer made the
quarter in :29%, ; . which -gave encourage
ment, and.with the -half; in. :59 it looked as
; if he would do something ' terrific: The
terrific pace j was. kept: up â¢to ; the ":â  three

and then came. the question of endurance. â¢

SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Sept 1;â
After a long and fruitless search, ex
tending over nearly the whole of this
vast American continent, three. Ger
man girls have finally obtained a defi
nite clew to the whereabouts of their
only brother, one of the heirs to a
large fortune left b- the death of a
wealthy uncle in Berlin. But another
discovery has transformed their joy
into sorrow.. Their brother turns out
to be a common jailbird, with the
brand of a felon on his hrow.
Yet, in order to obtain their share of
large fortune left by the death of a
tive, this brother's signature to a/cer
tain document Is an absolute neces
sity.
In the year 1890 a man named George
Bloch was Bent to San Queritin from
San Francisco tor burglary. By his
fellow convicts he was termed
''Blackie'' on account of his swarthy
complexion. He proved to be a pris^
oner of the most intractable type and
was a "dope fiend." O'Connor, who
has held the position of carpenter at
the prison: for nearly thirty, years,, met
"Blackie" frequently, and the convict,
on account of small favors, grew to be
his fast friend. '.:.':.'â :
One day in August, 1892, Bloch con
fided to his friend that he had a
wealthy uncle in Boise City, Idaho,
named Fletcher. He said he wished
to write this uncle for money, but did
not wish him to know he was in prison,
so would ask the uncle to send the
money to O'Connor for the pretended
reason that he (Bloch) was seldom in
one. place long, and O'Connor would
know where to forward the money to
him-. ."/. â¢â¢: â¢"â¢;â  . :: :
The plan worked well and in a short
time O'Connor received a check in
Bloch's favor for $50. When the money
arrived the convict was confined in the
dungeon for eating opium and O'Con
nor returned the money to his uncle
with a statement that Bloch found he
did not need it. The convict was re
leased in 1893 and disappeared.
About six months ago a wealthy
uncle of the ex-convict died in Berlin,
leaving a fortune of many thousand
dollars, to be . divided equally among
the nephew and the three nieces. A
clause in the will provided that each
one should sign a certain agreement
before the money could be partitioned.
The siÃters notified their Idaho uncle
of the facts and he began a. search
which led him aH over the country fol
lowing up will-o'-the-wjsp clews. Three
weeks ago, in looking over some pa
pers, he found the registered letter in
which the $50 had been returned him
by O'Connor In 1892, and immediately
came to San Quentin.
Once here the search seemed as futile
as ever, for Bloch had been missing
five years. O'Connor, however, took
pity on the gTay -headed old fellow, who
was evidently sorely distressed at find
ing his nephew to be a law-breaker,
and went to Warden Hale for assist
ance in looking up. Bloch's where
abouts. Patient inquiry at last revealed
a definite clew. A convict named
George Wilson, whose term of sentence
ended last Friday, had received. a let
ter of recent date from a former com
panion in the prison, who was now held
for another offense in the Canyon City
penitentiary of Colorado. One of the
passages in the letter read as follows:
"Do you remember George Bloch,
who was with us in San Quentin? I
mean 'Blackie.' Well, he is in here,
too, for the Bathe old thing â wasn't
slirk enough."
When Fletcher heard this news his
joy was unbounded. He wrote im
mediately to the sisters in Germany
and telling O'Connor that if Bloch were
found he should receive a suitable re
ward for hte services' as detective, took
the next train for the Canyon City
penitentiary. The precious paper rer
quiring Bloch's signature went with
him. o!o>nnor is in dally expectation
of a letter recounting the success of
the uncle's quest. ' . â¢

D. Murphy as chairman. The Silver
Republicans and Good Government
League will also be represented at the
conference. Just what allotment of of
fles will be given the Populists has not
been agreed upon, but it is understood
the Democrats want the lion's share.
The Populists will only indorse anti
ganp Democrats, and will insist upon
F. B. Brown for District Attorney.
The Democrats have J. H. Campbell
booked for the place, and a fight may
arise over filling the office that will pre
vent fusion. ' .
The Democratic Convention is con
sidered to be strongly anti-Rea, but
the Boss has made his boast that the
delegates must take his programme.
Rea wants Scheller for Judge and Bol
linger for Sheriff. Whether the con
vention will take these orders remains
to be seen.^
EVENING EXPOSITOR
SUSPENDS AT FRESNO
FRESNO, Sept. Lâ T^ Evening Ex
positor, the oldest paper in the county
and at one time the most influential
Democratic journal, suspended publica
tion thi# afternoon. A. B. Butler, the
real owner of the paper, publishes a
column editorial explaining the causes of
suspension. He states that for two years
the paper has been published by the
Fresno Publishing Company which, he
declares, has failed in its mission. He
charges that two members of the com
pany were acting in the interests of the
Southern Pacific Company, and states
that it were better for it to go down In
defeat than wear the collar of the South
eri^ Pacific. Seeing that they could n"t
control it, they deliberately plotted to
wreck it, he charges. A weeKly paper
will be published in the place of the
dally.

WALKED OUT IN
STOLEN CLOTHES
Charles Lenehan's Novel
Way of Purloining.
HIS EMPLOYERS SUFFERED
WAS AN IMPORTANT WITNESS
IN THE DURRANT CASE.
An Appeal to Hoffman, Rothchild &
Co. Not to Prosecuteâ Will Be
Booked on Three Charges
To-Day.
Charles Lenehan, a young man employ
ed by Hoffman. Rothchild & Co., whole
sale clothiers, now reposes in the tanks
at the City Prison, a victim to his own
cupidity.
While working in the well known es
toUlshment, it is alleged, he robbed it of
clothing amounting to nearly a hundrel
dollars and pawned his stealings, the pro
ceeds of which he devoted to fast living.
His plan of operations was a novel one,
and he might have continued it h:id he
not become careless. Choosing an ex
pensive pair of trousers he would go to a
side room and slip off his own and put on
the stolen article. He would then draw
his inferior piece of clothing on and bold
ly walk out of the store on so;ne pretext
or other. Vests received the Â«arno treat
ment, and no suspicion was aroused by
his actions. Being familiar with ihe dif
ferent departments Jn the store he chose
from such piles as would not be missed.
His service in the store, although a
short one, netted him many dollars tj Hol
low his rapid life.
l^enehan became bolder In h*3 opera
tions until articles began to be missed.
Mr. Rothchild, a member of the tirrn,
was notified, and try as ho would he
could not locate the leak. He then ap
pealed to the Doltce for aid. and Detec
tives Ryan and ODea were detailed to
look Into the robberies. They were given
a good description of the garm?!its stolen
and quietly made inquiries In different
pawn shops. They located part of the
stolen clothing in a pawn shop oi\ Third
street, and secured a description of Lene
han. They then kept watch on the store,
and finding that the latter answered the
description, followed him and captured
him in the act of plying his practice.
They took him to the City Prison on
Monday afternoon and lodged him in the
tanks awaiting further developments, it
was thought that others in the store had
been likewise guilty, but Mr. Rothchild
claims that this was the first time the
firm found clothing missing. Lenehan
comes of a good family, and every effort
Is being made to quietly settle the mat
ter. Mr. Rothchild has been appealed
to not to prosecute, but as yet he has hot
arrived at a decision.
Lenehan was brought into prominence
during the trial of Durrant. He testified
for the defense that the ring claimed to
have been pawned by Durrant was
pawned by himself. He will be booked to
day on three charges.

COLE IN CONTROL.
The New Coiner of the Mint Assumes
His Duties Without Any
Ostentation.
Dan T. Cole took his seat at the coln
or's desk in the Mint yesterday morning,
hung up his hat on the letter press and
gave the signal for the manufacture of
bright new golden double eagles to be
resumed. There was no ostentation in
connection with the new colpt's assump
tion of duties and no cha -es in the
working, force beyond the twenty ladies
whose dismissal was announced in yes-
terday's Call. Their successors will not
be announced until the list of names sent
on to Washington has been approved by
the Treasury Department and returned
to this city.
There is no patronage whatever con
nected with Mr. Cole's new office. Even
his confidential clerk is protected by the
civil service rules and is a legacy from
ex-Coiner Spotts. The fact that he is a
stranger and a Democrat is somewhat
fatiguing to the new official, hut Cole
says they will soon become acquainted
and he hopes in the course of time the
clerk will experience a change of heart
and become converted. So thoroughly is
the Mint governed by civil service that
even Superintendent Leach's secretary is
a hold-over from the Daggett regime.
Consequently Mr. Cole says there Is no
likelihood of there being any change in
the working force.

THE* SAM FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1898.
FATHER YORKE HONORED.
Receives a Testimonial of Gratitude From the
Clergy.
THE Catholic church, through its min
isters, the pastors of â '. th o various
Catholic churches throughout this
archdiocese, has honored Father
Torke In the presentation of an address
and testimonial of gratitude and appre
ciation of the work which he has accom
plished In the cause of Catholicism. The
honor conferred is one rarely accorded
by the church, and is a tribute which
few, if any, prelates ever receive.
Surrounded by the representative
priests of the entire archdiocese the pre
sentation was made last Thursday after
noon in the basement chapel of St. Mary's
Cathedral.
The idea of framing an appropriate ad
dress and testimonial was determined
upon about two years ago, and a commit
tee appointed at the time to make what
ever arrangements that would be found
necessary in having it made. The design,
after being outlined and accepted, was
sent to Ireland for the purpose of hav
ing it engrossed. Through various causes
it was delayed In reaching here, and was
not received until a few days prior to its
presentation. â  . ';. ..' '. : .
The address is beautifully and artisti
cally decorated, being worked in pen and
Ink and water colors. Situated on the
upper and lower borders are scenes of
Galway Bay and the Golden Gate, May
nooth College and the Catholic University
at Washington; the American eagle and
shield and the harp and wolf dog of Ire? .
land. On the side borders, giving promi
nence and emphasizing the effect pro-:
duced by the upper and 10-wer views, are
decorations of American and Irish de
signs. The entire , address Is set In a
heavy gilt frame and is mounted on an:
easel of dark green and gold.
To more fully express the feeling which
is felt and extended by the Catholic
clergy generally to Father Yofke a check
was presented him for $1000. The gift
was made in anticipation of a vacation
which he Intends taking in the near fu
ture, and was donated by the various
parishes. â¢â .''â 
The address was read by Father Lynch
of St. James' Church. It was as follows:
The history of the past two or three years.
In the stirring events of which you played so
conspicuous a part, makes a very Interesting
chapter In the annals of our State. Under the
specious guise of patriotism, men who were
strangers to the true spirit of freedom -secretly
handed themselves together with the avowed
purpose of depriving their Catholic felldw
cltlzens of the rights and privileges guaranteed
to them under the constitutions of the State
and Nation. "They made lies tht-lr ref.ug<j and
under falsehood did they hide themselves"; and
l>y unclean vilification and reckless 1 mendacity
succeeded in superinducing a religious conten
tion which, for a time, threatened to disrupt
the foundations of civil society.' and to make,
the Church of Christ an alien and an outcast
in a land to which it was the first to bring the
glad gospel tidings, and where, at peace with
all. it had lived, and flourished as a bay tree
by the running water.
Catholics were bewildered. The weaker
brethren among them advocated prayer and
patience. â â  They considered. It unwise and un
christian to oppose the campaign of falseho6d
by a campaign of truth. They bethought them
of the sweet humility of the early martyrs,
but seemed to forget the heroic courage of the
groat Christian apologists. Their paths were
peace and their advice was to abide patiently
until the Btorm had passed away, but the. storm
showed no sign of passing. Every day saw.lt
Increase. In force and fury. Every day â  from
preps and platform, by secret Insinuation and'
public proclamation. Catholics were accused of
the grossest crimes against God and man, till,
the minds of e - en honest and truth-loving men
were be ing affected by Incessant and unc'o'n
tradicted misstatementÃ. Disagreeable and.
hateful as religious controversy for the most
part Is, it became Imperatively necessary that
the truth should be spoke.n. How distasteful,
soever, it might be to the individual, the. good
name of the church. an<3 the interests of the
whole Catholic people demanded, this. The time
had come to speak, and the man. You, Rev.
Father, took up the gage of battle and entered
the lists against the defamers of our faith. â¢
There is no; need to tell how bravely and
skillfully you conducted the controversy, nor
to speak of those high intellectual gifts which
have: compelled the reverential fear of the il
literate bigot, and won you thfe respect of all
who are willing to appreciate true genius.
The story Â»t your long and successful strug
gle Is written on every Catholic heart In thÂ»
community, and your name Is held in grateful
and prayerful remembrance In every Catholic
home in the land. -â â 'â â .'â¢
We, the pastors of this, archdiocese of San
Francisco, beg you to accept the assurance of
our esteem and love. We rejoice at the fame
which Is rightly yours and we are proud pf

Hut this address hn.s a deeper signffloanee
than an expression of friendliness. It stands
as approval for a causa and a policy. It Is
the privilege of the church to be ever in the
midst of the conflict. In every 'country, from'
every side, attacks are made upon her,' There
the nations have raged, here have the peoples
devised vain things. We are get aÂ« sentinels, on

The church Is In the world as a city seated
on a mountain top, which cannot be hid. Her
officern are by their very position public men-.
Though in this country church and state are
separate,, it is not â¢' the- intention of the-con
stitution or of the .people that there should be
a. divorce between politics and morals.- . .The
law of right and wrong rules in public . life
as in private life, and It is not the -duty of the
priest to confine his promulgation of the moral
code to. the Individual alone. He has his place
In public, life and there' ne stands on high,
ground.- He stands- for honesty and decency
and Justice, and he cannot afford to stand- for
leÂ»a. He has nothing to gain from politicians
and nothing to fear. They rtand. for party,
which ever changes; he stands for principle. In
which there is no shadow of vicissitude.. In
the long run even In politics principle wins If
there be a man to fight for it and to keep nn
fighting. Surer, swifter, Is its victory In tho
great questions which transcend polLtics and
who is to apeak for it there if not the priest?
Who are the politicians that he should be
abashed before them? Even as a man and a
citizen he is as good as the best.
In the nature of things and by public opin
ion thÂ« clergy are a unit. They are set not
to busy themselves with many things but.
solely to regard the one thing necessary, the
honor of God. Therefore.it must be meet and
Just that we should sta-nd together always and
everywhere for the better part. After all. our
influence Is official. No matter what may be
the personal gifts or work of a man, It â Is
to the church he owes his. position and to -his
position he owes his power. History even In
our own day has verified the words. of Christ.
"Without me you are nothing." Thert'forn
our work Is not ours but God's. It is no parade
of humility but an insight into the truth of
things that forces to every prlest.'s month the
words "Non nohls Dc.mlne, non nobis sed' nom
lnl tiio da gtorlam." Hence the honor you show
me to-day I dare not claim far myself, it is
your honor and the honor of the Church of God.
Hut, friends, for your personal kindness and
encouragement and support during these -past,
yenr?., and for your friendship shown to -me to
day I thank you. It has come to this with
me that I must for a time cease from my work.
If I am to continue to work at a 11... This Is the

Caspar Whitney, the Well Known
Writer, Leaves Shortly, for the
Former Island Kingdom. .
Caspar Whitney, the writer, who is best
Known, -possibly, through his contributions
to the literature of sport, arrived here
yesterday, almost, direct from Cuba. He
was present. at the taking of Santiago. and
witnessed the stirring, scenes in the dis
tressed Island of Cuba during the war.
"The great mistake of the authorities
at Washington," he -said yesterday, "was
the delay In getting the major portion of
the troops out of Cuba when their serv
ices were no longer required. It was Gen
eral Shafter's purpose to get his men
away from the fever-Infected island Im
mediately upon, the surrender of Santi
ago. At* this time there were about 300
men ill. â¢ ' .â¢ '
"The men were not removed, but were
placed in an undesirable camp. As a
direct result, there were several thousand
men on the sick list within a fortnight.
Those who were well and those who were
ill were not segregated, so that the fever
spread rapidly. The same conditions pre
vailed on the transports."
Mr. Whitney is en route to Hawaii,
where he will make a close study of the
islands for Harpers. He passed through
here a year ago, going to Malaysia and
Slam hunting big game After a short
6tay there he went to England and France
to study the sports of those countries.
While there the war broke out, and he
hastened to the front.

New Orleans Is making a strong bid for
the patronage of the Eastern turfmen
during the coming winter. A dispatch
f ram the Crescent City is to the effect
that the jockey club there will hang up
$10,000 more for the stakes than formerly.
Jimmy McCormick, for three years past
the chief trainer for Burns & Waterhouse,
has clearly gone back on California com
pletely, for in a recent interview printed
in a Chicago dally he declares himself in
favor of New Orleans as a winter rac
ing point. As McCormick has received
the best of treatment in the Golden State,
the sudden shift of the New York horse
man and his enthusiastic praise of the
Crescent City leads one to the belief that
either McCormick had not the real ad
miration he professed for California or
else he has little gratitude in his soul.
Bob McKibbon, who Is well-known here
as the official announcer of both jockey
clubs, and who acted as patrol judge at
the Chicago tracks for several weeks this
season, says there will be a larger num
ber of horses coming to California to race
next fall from the Eastern side of the
Rockies than have appeared any previous
season. He declares that all the turfmen
who have raced their gallopers here in
ytars agone will, be on hand when the
bell rings at Oakland track November 1,
and. that several newcomers will be on
the list of owners, notably puke & Wish-
ard, who have the crack riders Relff
(Johnny and Lester) under contract. N.
Turner, one of the best of the younger
riding brigade, will also be on deck, as
will A. Barrett, now piloting racers at
the far East. "Brown Dick" (Ed Brown)
will send four or five good ones out here
â¢to ra.ee, and. â¢ Eugene Leigh and Pat
Dunne, who were not active turfmen here,
last season, will' be here this time with
about the best strings in the country.
Tiiui Ryan will send out several that will
earn their oats in any company, .and
doubtless Louis Ezell, Dan Honlg and
other turfmen enthusiastic over California
climate for racing purposes will influence
Some of their friends to come out and
secure new lease of life. â â¢
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club stakes are
out. â  They were announced in Chicago be
fore, they were made public In San Fran
cisco, strange to relate. Of those to be
run for in IX9S there are eight in all, and
of thoelght three are of the "guaranteed
value" of $1000, three of $12tÂ», two of
$1500. Of the announced 1&99 stakes three
are eighteen, and twelve are $1000 affairs
of the "guaranteed" description. The
California Oaks ($2000)), California Derby
($5000) and Ingleside stakes $3500) are the
only events worth mentioning. If the
Horsemen's Protective Association does
not make the Pacific Coast Jockey Club
wipe the "guaranteed value" part of the
conditions off tne books and substitute
"s^â added by the club" it will
create surprise. How ridlclulous these
"SIOOO guaranteed value" stakes â¢ (?)
are, to be sure! Not a blooming owner
on the list "trains to the hour ' for a
sihjjle one of them, and not as mucn in
terest Is felt by the racegolng" public in
these travesties as in an October derby.
If instead of twenty-six stakes there were
seven or eight- worth as much as the
twenty-six there would be some talk in
dulged in- as to the prospective winner
and some interest felt in the outcome. If
â there is an additional dollar brought in
at the gate the day these jokes are per
petrated the managers wnÂ» he forced to
put on a powerful pair of spectacles to
be enabled to see it.
The Australian Jockey Club has notified
that at all registered race meetings with
in the metropolitan district (40 mifes
radius) the amount of added money shall
not be less than Â£400 per day, distributed
among not more than six races. .At all
such meetings there shall be on each day
at least one race on the flat (not beinK a
selling race) of not less than one mile and
a quarter, to which the added money
shall not be less than Â£100 and there shall
be not more than one selling race each
day to which the added money shall not
exceed Â£50. This alteration is causing the
proprietary clubs to kick a bit. while
horse owners, on the contrary naturally
think It a very proper move, says the
Sydney Referee.
â¢The Australasian comes out strongly in.
favor of the totalizator style of betting,
as against bookmaklng, declaring that
''the tote" has* been a godsend to the turf
of South Australia, Queensland, New
Zealand and other portions, enabling the
jockey clubs of those countries to give
about three times as much In the shape
of purses and stakes ' as formerly. The
Australasian writer g^es on to. say that
plunging on certain events is done away
with and many men are saved from finan
cial ruin by the operation of. the machine
on race days -only: That is rather an
argument in .favor of the totalizator than
anything else. The direct . rewards for
fraudulent practices upon the. turf be
tween owners- and bookies .fire also made,
things of- the past by the working of the.
machine, for a winner.. has- to be -picked,
and that is hot always -easy. In thin
country, the only places â  where; paris
mutti-els aw sold to any great extent, are
Butte and Anaconda,. Mont. \ The system
is pronounced a great success there, those
little.clties being capable, of giving, ample
support to a race meeting of about ten
weeks' duration; eacfr year.. The average,
revenue derived there, from- the sale of
paris â  mu'tuels anil "auction, pools amounts
to about $2200 per day. equal, to the-mon.py
rweivod "from-- "twepty-tWo" bookmakers:
The coming- Latoriia meeting is likely to
adopt -the- Butte. plan of betting, as. It Is
said the -bookmakers, nre going "broke"
paying privilege, money to associations.
Thorp will, in consequence, not .be- enough
pencllers- there to transact the business of
â¢the bp'ttihg ring and make the club come
out even-or anywhere' near It.. â¢ â¢ "â

NOT READY TO ANSWER.
WHEN the Examiner was civilly asked to give
an accounting of the money it is collecting
from the public for the ostensible purpose of
erecting a monument to the riien of the Maine there
was no definite expectation of a direct reply. Such
an indication of honesty on the part of that paper
would have been unique, a precedent never to be fol
lowed by it again. Hence the evasive reply evoked
is neither a surprise nor a disappointment.
Declining to give the facts itself, the Examiner re
fers inquirers to George Gould, as custodian of the
fund. It says that Gould has never attained a repu
tation as a falsifier, but is known as an honorable
business man. and thus that his statement of the case
can be depended upon. In other words, the reputa
tion of the Examiner management is such that it
would not be able to make a statement which could
be depended upon> and it turns the matter over to
Gould. While it is natural to admire this frankness,
the public, clamoring for light, is still as much as ever
in the dark.
Inquiry is not as to what Gould .may do with the
money he receives, but as to what the Examiner does
with the money it receives. Here it has been adver
tising a certain show, soliciting patronage for it on
the ground that a portion of the proceeds were to
be devoted to the erection of a monument. The pub
lic asks what share the monument is to have, how
large is to be the Examiner's rake-off. It is not
interested in the conduct of Gould, but simply de
sires to .trace the money from the box-office to the
Examiner and find what portion of it sticks to that
thrifty institution; .whether or not another "charity"
fake is being, perpetrated. The baseball tournament
style of Journalism is under a cloud.
These are all simple and proper questions. They
could l;e. answered by the presentation of a few fig
ures. The Examiner refuses to answer. Its silence
created immediate suspicion, and its evasion is chang
ing this to a belief that under color of pretended
patriotism the people ate being worked again:
OUR GROWING PRESTIGE.
AMONG the many comments made upon the
encyclical of the Czar calling for a peace con
ference of the European powers none is more
curious or more significant than that of Professor Del
bruck, the eminent German historian, who rs quoted
as having; said: "The manifesto is simply a .move in.
Russian diplomacy,. The Czar is doubtless sincere.
' His Ministers are not. The manifesto is issued with
the object of gaining time in the race against two
countries,.- England and America, ."but its point most.
â  directly is turned against the United. States .. of
America, which are beginning to -arm- Their posi

WELLS-FARGO VS. THE PEOPLE.
NECESSITY has arisen for again mentioning the
unpatriotic and illegal stand of the Wells-
Fargo Express Company. This is a corpora
tion vastly rich, nurtured under the protection of. the
Government, made more wealthy by the war in
which the Government has been involved, and yet re
fusing to pay its share of the burden of expense. It
prefers 'to wrest from patrons the tax Congress
meant it should pay. The Call is a patron. It cheer
fully pays whatever the exigencies of the times has
demanded. The declaration was made in advance
that it would do so. But it refuses to submit to the
exaction of Wells- Fargo, it declines to be robbed.
The Wells-Fargo combination shall never be per
mitted fo practice larceny unless it shall first secure
the sanction of the highest court in the land, and we
do not believe this can be obtained.
Yesterday the express company presented to this
paper a bill for the revenue stamps used on packages
of Calls forwarded by it. Payment was refused, is
refused and will be refused. There is a principle in
volved, a principle of far greater importance than the
sum at issue. The company, through its representa
tive, has declared that it will receive no more papers.
The position of the Examiner is similar to ours.
With that paper we have had many differences, but
we congratulate it that in this matter its stand is
just, its contention sound, and hope it will never
yield to the arrogant and selfish demand of a cor
poration governed by a desire to swejl dividends at
whatever cost of decency and whatever plunge into
shameless peculation.
Officials of the company say they deplore conten
tion and seek peace, but they do not deplore to the
extent of being honest, and their seeking does nbt
go to the extreme of keeping them within the bounds
of the law.* The statute is plain enough. The officials
simply are dishonest. They know that they do not
speak the truth, and their idea is to get the matter
into court and to keep it there until the war tax shall
be a thing of the past. Then the ultimate verdict will
not particularly interest them. That the company is
playing the part of hypocrite is clear from the fact
that when the law was passed the company's attorney
was consulted and gave the opinion that Wells-Fargo
must pay the tax. Acting on this, agents had been
given a letter instructing them to pay the tax, when
notice came that Eastern concerns had decided to
make a test case. Wells-Fargo, knowing that delay
would-be inevitable, was willing to await a decision.
In vain the United States District Attorney here was
urged to take action. He, too, was willing to wait.
By hook or crook, some influence had succeeded in
introducing into his office so marked and effective a
paralysis that as a protector of the rights of the peo
ple the office became useless. If the District Attorney
continue deaf to the summons of duty Judge de
Haven will be requested to put in his place somebody
capable of performing the duties so far as the pres
ent controversy is concerned.
We must ask from friends consideration during the
determination of the controversy. If Wells-Fargo
make good the threat not to carry Calls there will be
unavoidable tardiness for the present in reaching
subscribers. Every effort will be made to have this
tardiness as slight as possible. The mails will be
utilized, and we feel that friends will understand the
situation and forbear complaining. We are fighting
for more than a paltry amount claimed by the ex
press company. Loyalty to the flag, a sense that we
will have the approbation of all patriots, sustains us.
The Company was offered opportunity to make the
question the subject of a friendly suit, and would not
consent. It chooses to fight, thinking to hold final
determination in abeyance until determination shall
be of no consequence to it. We are ready for the
fight, will protest against slowness in the bringing of
a verdict, and shall expect friends to stand by us, for
the fight will be as much for them as for ourselves.
PROTECTING A WATERSHED.
A REPRESENTATIVE of The Call recently
visited the forest region of Mount Shasta and
made record of the facts touching the destruc
tion of timber. .
The outdoor smelting of copper, as practiced at
Keswick, has been for some time noticed as the agent
in destroying not only timber, but all vegetation for
a long distance around the point where the work is
carried on. The fumes emitted by that method of
reducing copper ore prove inimical to vegetable life.
A correspondent from Keswick* not denying the
facts as stated, complains that making them public
is injurious to the copper company and to the com
mercial interests of Keswick and other towns in
Northern- California. Incidentally the plea is made
that the trees destroyed are not fit for lumber or tim
ber, and that their value is entirely out of proportion
to the value of the copper extracted. This plea that
industries destructive of other things are productive
of greater wealth than they destroy, and therefore are
morally and economically justifiable, is not new. In
the case at hand, however, the complainant is mis
taken in supposing that the stumpage value of the
trees destroyed shall alone offset the profits of the
industry which destroys them. The young pines, man
zanita and chaparral which have succumbed to the
fumes of copper smelting and have died, together
with the grasses and other annual vegetation on the
ground beneath them, were all factors in the protec
tion of the watershed of the Sacramento River.
It will be admitted that if that entire watershed, or
a considerable part of it, is reduced to the same con
dition as the region around Keswick, the conserva
tion of water to flow in the river's channel will be
impaired. The stream will become more subject to
floods,: which will devastate the lands on either side,,
and when these floods pass will shrivel in volume so
as to be useless for the purposes of navigation or ir
rigation. Mining of the precious and useful minerals
is of great importance to civilization. It is a prime
factor in the wealth of a Staie which possesses such
minerals. But, after all, it is of necessity a self
limiting resource of wealth. When the minerals are
taken out the industry ceases. The -use of the s-oil
for producing vegetable crops, whether of timber or
grain or fruit, is a permanent resource. As the
mines are worked out the camps that have flourished
on their output fall into decay. The homes sustained
on, the productive capacity of the soil, whether of
timber or crops of the field, vineyard and orchard,
are as permanent as the soil itself. ' ': . â 
The point is made that the mountain region where
the watershed of the Sacramento lies is not fit for â 
agriculture or horticulture, and that the minerals. of
that area are its most valuable resource. This is
probably true. But if it be shown that preservation
of that Watershed by saving the tree pfodu-cing char
acter of its soil is necessary to the fertility of the Sac
ramento Valley from Redding to Rio Vista, the point
loses all valne as an economic argument.
The law of the matter lies in the familiar principle
that a man may use his own, but not to the avoidable
injury of that which belongs to another. If the Kes
wick company desire to place itself at one with the
prior interests which are damaged by its present
I methods it should seek others which enable the con-.

tinuance of its profitable operations without inflicting
these injuries which expose it to criticism. The
Call is not engaged in a mission for creating preju
dice against those who are developing any of the re
sources of the State. But it cannot turn a deaf ear
to the complaints of the despoiled. '
The far-reaching future of this State, the fertility of
its soil and. its capacity to sustain a dense popula
tion depend upon the preservation of its mountain
forests and vegetation on the wide watersheds of. its
streams. This preservation serves more than one
purpose. It assures a constant crop of commercial
timber, retains the. admirable features of our climate
and maintains the fertility of our valley soil. In no
respect, are these things speculative or theoretical.
They are demonstrated over and over again in older
countries and the experience of. more than two
thousand years. ' â¢.-.'. '
THE METHODS Of CHIEF LEES.
IT is reported that Mr. McVey, the Delaware de
tective who is sojourning in San Francisco await
_ : . ing action in the Botkin; extradition case, dis
agrees with Chief of Police Lees: as to the latter's
method, of investigating crime. He says that in.
Delaware and other Eastern States it is now the cus
tom to give all evidence as it is. gathered to the pub
lic, which in these days, like the Roman Comitia, has
a great deal to say about whether people shall be sent
to prison or to the gallows, and against whose wishes
no person can usually be so disposed of. Mr. McVey
believes the more publicity given to the facts of the
Botkin case the better for all parties, and were he
handling it he is free to say he would immediately
take the newspapers into his confidence, . .
Evidently this Delaware detective does not under
stand the principle upon which the : Ha.vkshaw at the
head of the San Francisco Police Department works
his wonders to perform. For his information it may
be said that the methods of Chief Lees are essentially
secretive. He is mysterious and furtive. He never
tells what he knows unless the newspaper applying
for information will consent to glorify him. He is
somewhat of a .-blow-hard and is accustomed to boast
of his legal knowledge, though as a matter of fact he
resembles necessity in knowing no law whatever. It:
has long been a tradition in San Francisco that, a
police officer who gets into the newspapers without
consulting the Chief and taking him in also loses his
job. Moreover, our local Ha wkstiaw is a veritable
Vidocq. Will Mr. McVey believe us when we say
that Chief Lees is in the habit of arresting people on
suspicion, locking them up in the '"tanks/ and after
"investigating" their conduct setting them free with
out explanation? Does this practice prevail in DelaT
ware? That it prevails here Mr. McVey may ascer-r
tain by asking any old resident, ; . . ".'
For instance, suppose Chief Lees should suspect
Colonel Tobin of the Hibernia Bank of poisoning
Mrs. Dunning, Would he swear out a: warrant and
arrest the colonel in the usual way? Not at all: He
would quietly slip over to the bank, engage the
colonel iii conversation and walk him to the City
HalL Arriving there he would suddenly whisk him
into a: "tank." After several weeks Colonel Tobin's:
friends might discover where he was and get him
put, but if he were not so fortunate as to possess
friends he would remain in jail until it suited the
royal pleasure of the Chief of Police to release him.
Detective McVey may think this is 'illegal, tut that
signifies nothing. Lees is, a law unto .himself.
Of course nothing like this could happen to
Colonel Tobin. The colonel is a Police . Com'mis-:
sioner and has a "pull." Chief Lees never throws the
fortunate possessor of a pull into the "tanks." In
fact, he often refuses to arrest persons with a. "pull."
Vide the case of Mr, Figel. â¢ '. . 'â¢ . â¢ â '.
All this may surprise Detective McVey, but it : is
strictly in accordance with the truth. Ouf local
Hawkshaw works like a bee in a tar barrel and fer
rets out crime mostly by getting, himself written up
in the newspapers. His methods are so thoroughly
understood here that no- intelligent man pays the
slightest attention to anything he says or any theory,
he entertains. When it is made apparent that Chief
Lees considers Mrs. Botkin guilty the entire com
munity will unanimously put faith in her innocence.
In other words, to use a slang phrase which may be
unfamiliar to Mr. McVey. w;e "copper" Lees out
here every time. If the Delaware authorities really
believe Mrs. Botkin guilty arid actually desire her
extradition they should at once induce the Chief to
espouse her cause and proclaim .her innocence. That
will convict her beyond the peradventure of a doubt.
AMID all the damaging reports and rumors that
are flying about the heads of almost every high
official who has had much, to do with the con
duct of the war. it is notable that, not even partisan
antagonism has given rise to a single charge against
the President or a single attack upon either 'his ser
vices or his character. It may be said of him "he
has won golden opinions from all sorts Of people."
His popularity is almost without a. parallel in' the
records of our Government. .'â¢"â¢:â¢' :
A striking illustration of the high esteem in which
he is held even by his politicar.opponehts was re
cently given in a. tribute paid to him b^y Senator Me-
Laurin of South Carolina', -who, in. conjmenting. upon
the policy of the President in declining to. accarn
pany the declaration of war. with a- recognition of
Cuban independence, said:-. â¢â¢ â¢'-.'â¢â ':
"The President has shown .wonderful judgment in
dealing with the war problem.- T voted' for the recog
iiiti.on of Cuban independence, but I am free to admit
I made i great mistake. The President was right m
refusing to recognize- the â  insurgents.' They have
demonstrated to all reasonable men that' they are
nothing short of a band of cowardly robbers; without
an organized, form of government or an. army." â¢ '
Warming to his theme the South Carolina Senator
went on to point out what the President has. done
to eliminate the last vestiges of sectional feeling .be
tween North, and South. The President, he said,'
"has known no section or party in the administration
:of the high duties imposed upon him; arid his ap
pointment of Butler, Lee, " Wheeler and Gordon to
high and responsible positions has won the hearts
and the sympathy of the men .and. women of the
South, and he is to-day the pride of the entire nation.'
I predict that his- peace policy will be as wise, and as
firm and as much of a success as was his war policy.".
. This, glowing tribute from = a Democratic Senator
to a Republican President,' coming as it does on the
eve of a general election, when party antagonisms
.are .beginning to run high,. .is as creditable to the giver
as to the recipient. It is a striking proof of the com
plete restoration of good feeling between the North
and the South.. Moreover; the 'eulogium was in no
respect overdone. It was but plain justice to say
' thaf McKinley is "to-day the pride of the entire na
tich,"and abundant reasons exist to justify the bright
prediction that "his peace policy will be as' wise and
as firm and as much of a success as his war policy."
Perhaps it would be as well not to convict Mrs.
Botkin until some direct evidence has been produced,
and even then leave the task -to the courts.
McKINLEY'S POPULARITY.
HOW THEY FIGHT WELLS-FARGO.
ASH FORK, Ariz., Aug. 27.â Editor San Francisco Call^Dear
Sir: Regarding your good fight against Wells, Fargo & Co.'s extor
tion of revenue stamps from their customers, I will give you our ex
perience. ' The remedy is very simple.
The sending of packages is, with many, largely a matter of habit.
Thousands of packages can go just as well by mail. Before July
1 our payments to our home office here averaged $30 a month. In
July, we reduced this to $13. In time we hope to. cut it down to a very
small amount, and we will not send any article by express excepting
those we cannot avoid sending. .
Should merchants and others adopt this course Wells, Fargo & Go.
would soon obey the new tariff law. Yours very truly, . ;

Theatrical Managers Morrissey

more or less Influ

regard as omens of
good or evil por

Strange to. say,
some managers are
riot free from super

in: "hoodo.os". and
'"mascots," and in
some instances that
which Is . the terror

fact in the occurrence at the Orpheum
the other evening.
The manager was, as usual, standing in
the wings watching the original turns of
the hew people and smoking like a coal,
pit. When Barney Fagan went on and
announced that he would "sing a song
about number 13," Morrissey threw his
cigar on the floor and stamped on it by
way of emphasis and emphatically, de
clared that . that "queered the whole
show." And it did. . . : ' â¢'â¢.
"When Miss Byron attempted to do the

Works are responsible for this: Complaints have been filed, from this com
munity and other, places with the State Board of Health, but nothing has
. ever been done. Now something must be done, arid done, quickly. The Selby
Smelting Works must be made to understand that they must ' consume the
fumes from their smelterâ and ' the expenditure of a small amount of money
will accomplish this.' If the State Board of Health is notable to. abate this .
nuisance we had better appeal to the next Legislature to pass laws, com
pelling these corporations to consume the smoke and fumes arising from
their smelters. We are with The Call in its endeavor to prevent this out
rage on this or any other community by corporations i of this kind, arid we ' â 
hope that our next representatives in our .legislative halls at Sacramento
will have laws passed to prevent the devastation of valuable property and
whole communities. The damage already done to land and cattle cannot 1
| be estimated and this nuisance muat be abated-

.correction of : . the figures â¢.â given /comparing
rates here and in Europe. The freight
rates for. England seem- very high, but as
they include cost of loading and unload

English rate (average) aiso includes the
rate for small parcelsâ under 100 poundsâ
which are charged at. a .'proportionately

The Good Work Done by an Adopted
. Son. of California.
The friends, of. Lieutenant GenrgÃ M.
Stoney, for sorpe tirna prior to the break
ing out. of the wal-.ih charge of the United
States naval. recruiting station at 10 Calf
forma street in this city, will ho pleased
to learn that he has added much to his
record as an officer, and sailor during the
recent Tvar-thuuph fortune denied him
the chance of battle with the enemy
Lieutenant Stoney was ordered East at
the breaking out. of the war and assigned
to the auxiliary cruiser Prairie as naviga
tor, which, in answer to the clamor from
the New. England States, was sent with
the San. Francisco to cruise between Cape
Cod and the banks of Newfoundland for
reported Spanish privateers. Though
these proved to be myths the six weeks
spent there was full of arduous duty, tha
more so as the vessel was manned by
naval reserves from Massachusetts, and
with the: exception of the captain and
Lieutenant Stoney, no one on board had
seen actual service before.
From thore the Prairie was sent to the
Cuban coast and took part in the fight
with the forts and the burning of the
Spanish steamer Alfonso XII at the port
of Mariel. Shortly after she was orctered
to (Jibara. on the: northeast coast (if
Cuba, to prevent the escape of the Span
ish forces from the province of Santiago
by sea.. Here they learned of the fail
of Santiago on July 21, and on July 24
were ordered to blockade San Juan, Porto
Rico. After a week on this duty they
went to Porto: Po-nce to assist in landing
the army arid stores. It was here that
Lieutenant. Stoney had an opportunity of
Tendering most valuable services to" the
Oovernment. The large transport Massa
chusetts,: formerly of the International
line,, costing nearly a million dollars and
carrying 1200 men. 1200 horses and mules
and . 2,000.000 rations, besides other valu
able stores^ went aground on a coral reef
at the entrance of the harbor, and was
at first giv^n up for a total loss. Lieuten
ant Stoney was Ordered to examine the
situation and save the cargo and ship if
possible. This he did without the loss
of a horse or a pound of cargo, after two
days and nights of hard work, and later
took the ship over to Arroyo, General
Brooke's headquarters.
'.' For his. success in this undertaking
Lieutenant Stoney has been much com- ;.
plimented, though he is' still lamenting
the fate that kept him from the more
lively scenes of action where others
earned well deserved laurels, as he might
have done. : . : : ; .

Oakland Office San! Francisco Call,
.908 Broadway.. Sept. 1.
At the meeting. of the Republican Coun
ty Central. Committee next Saturday it is
almost certain that Oakland will be se
lected as. the place for holding the county
convention. Two years, ago Alameda waa
favored; four years ago it went to Hay
wards, arid now it 1b but logical .for it to
come back to the county BesLi. it Is also
: safe to presume that in; the .city of Oak
land the delegates . will be elected by
wards. In the townshtpn there wilt be
a few minor changes in the lines, which
Will affect but a few precincts. This, it
is said,, is done for the purpose of making
it .more convenient for voters, to. reach
the polls.. There may be some other mor
tlve not apparent, on the :surface. '. â¢'.
One of. the shrewdest of the. county pol
iticians compiled a comparative state
ment to-day snowing that. ..at present
there is both a "pull .and a '"push"' at
j work for the nominations. On : one side
I he : lined up Harinifin, Grim, Robinson,
j Allen, Mehrman, Lynch,- Harluw arid Dal
tobi and on. the other side Jordan, Spear,
Batrber, . Harry Melvin,' P.:. M, Fisher,
Rogers and . Cal Ewirig:, \ . â :.' . "
The lirst of. these tickets contains fnany
names hew as office holders, but its geo
graphical arrangement is rather clever.
The second, ticket contains the name's of
those who have ;been lqng.est before- the
county as candidates, and who have al
ready done, inuch' work! . . "
It: is not possible' that either of these
combinations, can go through in. its en
tirely, but ..there are at least two dis
tinct -factions' now contesting, and sur
prises may be . the order of the day at
j th*; convention. .'. . '
The condition, of affairs in the Fourth
Ward it just now of, special interest. For
many years G. K. Snook and the Cnurches
j have helped each other mutually. W. H..
j .Church has been -Supervisor, while C. K.
i Snook hais . had several terms in ofnee,
eitl'ier as Justice of. the' Peace, or District
Attorney,, largely owing to the support
of the Churches. In return Liri Church
has been Snook's chief deputy. And each
side has profited by the combination. Now
tht.-lr ways have fallen apart." Mr. Snook
has announced that he does not desire -a'|
county office.- and has gone into the State
fight. ; Will Church has rhade other com
binations arid for the first time In many
years- is working independently of C. E. .
Snook. . â¢ .â¢â 'â¢.â  . â 
Assessor Dalton has not yet .â¢ stated
whether he will seek the Republican nor
n or whether he -will again be an in
! dependent -candidate. 'Dalton lives in the
First Ward, arid in order to secure a
nomination from the convention it is but
I reasonable . from a political 'standpoint
i that he shoirtd be able to take a delega
tion from his own ward into the conven
tion. As the First Ward Is a strong
railroad district, and as Mr. Dalton has
made his record on an anti-railroad plat
form things are hardly likely to be har
monious. 'At- the present time fhe rall
| road company has many hundreds of
t extra men at work widening moles, build
ing bridges and laying new tracks, and
the vote from t.he First will probably be
heavier than for some years. It is this
problem that causes Mr. Dalton' to hesi
tate. .
Jerry Tyrrell, at one time Sheriff of this
! county. Is now a candidate in opposition
jto Supervisor Talcott, who desires re
election. Mr. Tyrrell has been active In
politics all his life and is fully acquaint
ed with the ropes.
I The friend^ of Dr. Simpson in Alameda
i have organized a club to help him in his
i Supervisorial tight, and have sent out the
following circular, which speaks for
itself:
Dear Sir: At a meeting of. Republicans of
the Fourth and Sixth wards held a few' even
ings ago there was organized a Third Super
ylsorla) District Kinippon Club, the object of
which Is tn put in the field at the coming party
primary election a ticket favorable 'to Mr
FlnniS'in fur Supervisor, but unpledged to other
candidates, ('amlidates for other county of
fices may become associate members upon pay
ment of $.".
At the time of making up the ticket asso
ciate members may nubmit their list of dele
gates* to the executive committee, who will se
lect a ticket from the lists so submitted. Yours
very truly, A. L. LEBER, Secretary.
The Tribune has canvassed many of the
| candidates for office and has published
their views, which show that without a
single exception all desire the county
primaries to be called on the lines- of
wards and townships.
E.- B. Clement, a School Director, has
decided that an inquiry should be held
into ihe matter of the employes of the

I 'Clement 'thinks such conduct, was- im
i proper on the part of a ' school teacher,

"About the 20th of- July," said Mr..Ber
liner yesterday, "we heard in Quezalte

Ocos! It was rumored that he had an
army of 2000 Mexicans, but it was after
ward learned that he had only 400 men.
chiefly IndlanÃ. The Government, before
learning of. this, made elaborate defensive
preparations.. With ' two hundred men
General Molina took- the plaza of San
Marcos from the insurgents after a three
hours 1 battle. The combined loss was j
about fifty. Mpllnals men were armed
with Mauser riiles..
"On the 2^th of July a decree was is
sued by the Government to the effect that
every Guatemalan who did not present
himself within three, hours would be de
clared a traitor. It also announced the-
Government suspended and that the. re
public was under martial law. The Gov
ernment soon had 5000 troops, half of
them Indians, under arms. .....
"It was reported at thLs time that the
insurgents were on their way to Quezal- |
tenango so all the stores were closed, j
'men Government troops- under command,
of General Garcia Leon and armed with I
sixteen cannon were ready for them.
Guards were posted about the : cl.ty. but
no attack was made.
"By mistake the insurgents made war
upon one another. They became separ
ated in t' c night and a drunken captain,
seeing, armed men approach, opened fire
upon them. A battle ensued and it was
sum,, time before the persons attacked
recognized their assailants. They could
not communicate with them until they
hit upon the plan of sending a Courier
to a telegraph station some miles dis
tant. He telegraphed into the city find
hostilities ceased. Some 4000 shots were
ex. -hanged and five people were killed. .
"On July 31 it was learned in Quezalte
nango that Prospero Morales had called
his men together and had gone to a
place called Coatepecque. The Govern
ment claimed this as a victory, the band !
playing'and fireworks being exploded. â  It
was thought that the revolution way
ended, but it proved otherwise. General !
Barillas went there with 1000 men and
defeated Morales after a struggle of
thirty-six hours. He retreated to the
mountains, wuere General Garcia Leon |
tried to trap him, but the effort proved
unavailing.
"On August 6 there was more music
and fireworks. It was learned that a
little English gunboat. at Ocos had driven
the revolutionists out. Had it not been j
for that the rebels would have been in '
Ocos yet. The day we left, August 17, j
it was reported that Prospero Morales j
was found dead n-ear San Marcos. This
has not been confirmed.
"The election was to have taken place f
yesterday and then more fighting was ex- !
pected. The only hope for that country
Is the election of a strong man to rule
the people as President."

Heavy Fine Imposed on

VIOLATED THE GAME LAWS
WAS SEVERELY ADMONISHED
BY THE JUDGE.
The Defendant Was Arrested for

The FiÃh and Game Conrmisslonera are
determined that the laws for the pres
ervation of game, in this State, shall be
enforced. In the -past they have found
it difficult to secure convictions, or, . if
they did, the punishment was seldom in
keeping with the. crime. '..-''.'
A notable victory was gained oh Wed
nesday, whea Deputy Commissioner
Charles A. Vogelsang secured the con
viction of J. F. Cprriea, a poultry dealer
ut 406 Davis, street, in the. Police Court
over which .Judge Mogah '. presides. He
was charged with having received five
d-ozen wild duck; the box being marked
"poultry." The shipper, O r B. Harris of
Los Banos,- was . also . arrested, and he
pleaded. guiltyi He Was caught sending
another box: containing duck; marked
"dried fruit," to .Corriea. The duck sea
son will not open until October. L 'â â '..
' Gorriea. was sentenced. by Judge Mo
gan yesterday, to pay a fine of ?100, or
in default of. that to be imprisoned at
the rate of one day for eaoh dollar, until
the line was satisfied. In passing sen
tence Judge Mogan : said i ; ; â¢â¢'â¢â  â¢ .'.
la this case the. defendant,. Charles Corriea,
has been arrested and charged -.wtth a viola
tion of .the game laws, ol- the. State of Call
â fornia. It Is alleged that' on . the 27th day of
August, 1898, he committed the crime of mis
demeanor by :willfully and unlawfully having
in his possession certain wild' duck. He Is
prosecuted under the section â¢ known, as 626 of
the fish and game laws of the .State ofc Cali
fornia, which reads.: ' â¢â¢'Every: person- who be
tween- the Ist- day 6t -March. arid the Ist day of
October in each year' shall' hunt,- pursue, take,
kill or destroy or have in. his- possession any
valley quail, bob-white, partridge, or any Rind
of wild duck or ratl, etc.," is guilty of a- mis
demeanor. : This person -might Just aÂ« â  well
have waited -until ' the opening' of the game .
Beison before he should attempt to deal in such
affairs as wild duck. I don't' think he did right
In doing it. and I don't think he acted like a
luw-abidlng citizen. I believe that the- con
viction following the .hearing of his. trial waa
a Just and proper, one. The object of the' gamÂ«
laws of this State is. Indeed a meritorious one;
and one that deserves the hearty commenda
tion, not only of the public, .but the support
of the same by every tribunal of Justice ih
California. That same law has been- willfully
violated without compunction by certain per-.
"Bonnges with only a- mercenary object, in view..
I believe that the arrest and conviction arid,
punishment of the consignee of game out. of
season will strike' at the fountain-head of the
transgression of this, statute. You, the.dealer.;
are wholly and only responsible for its viola
tion, because if you respected, the provisions,
of the statute and obeyed them and absolutely
refused to receive or sell game out of sea*on
then the hunter would be . deprived of a live
lihood. The game would' not he depleted anil
scarce as It is at present, and as. a consequence
thereof during the' hunting peason ajl -parties
would find out -public preserves abundantly
plentiful with game. I wish- you, as well as
other dealers,, to understand that -I' will.d eal
strictly and severely with any. and aIL Violateâ¢
of this. law. â¢ â¢ â  'â  ".

EASTERN MARKETS.
NKW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Sept I.â The day's stock mar
ket was dull to the verge of stagnation for
practically all of the standard stocks. There
was no soy-re pressure of liquidation, but
neither was there any demand to buy. Evi
dently the elaborate manipulation of the full
clique, which, in view of the favorable condi
tion?, was expected to Invite a prolonged out-
Elde buying movement which would carry
prices from enÂ» higher stage to another, has
come to naught for the time being. The pro
fessionals have realized, but the new holders
are vulnerable to the machinations of the bear
llque and aro loath to h.-ld their stocks in a
declining market. There is a constant dribble
of. realizing md a sagging of prices.
The market was redeemed trom absolute dull
ness to-day by movements in special stocks.
Sugar and Manhattan were marked up by
brokers. IV. >ple n c,as receded on the failure
of the agreement among Inside interests ex
pected to r.-sult from yesterday's conference.
There was larse absorption of b^th Northern
Pacific preferred and Vnlon Pacific preferrM,
Union Pacific's favorable statement for July
giving i\;e movement :i fresh Impetus. The
common stocks both suffered iroin liquidation.
Th>> porjecta of the ereat new Federal St"el
Company were reflected in the activity of vari
ous stocks afT.rt.-,', General Electric Con
solidated Ice, New York Air Brake and Balti
more and Ohio, the Cleveland, Wheeling and,
Lorraine st'x-ks, Buffalo. Rochester and Pitts
burp stocks showed marked advances. So far
as thf outlook in the money market is con
cerned there Is a prospect of easier conditions.
There was no more gold imported to-day, but
sterling exchange was weak and London money
rates aT still below the New York level, though
they hardened further to-day. The announced
lnn-ntlon of the Treasury Department to
anticipate the October interest payments on
the 4 per cent bonds will release over $5,000,000
to the market. It !s expected also that the
distribution of the new Government 3s will be
much more rapid than heretofore. The action
of the Treasury In anticipating interest pay
ment Is an indication of the rather pressing
needs of the money. Such a measure has not
been resorted to since the period of Secretary
Wlndom's administration, when the old tariff
law was yielding a surplus revenue.
The bond market shared In the dullness of
stocks and [rices vlelded before the end of
the day. Total sales, t. 290.000.
Quotations for Government bonds were un
changed.' The new 3s are ft lower on actual

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. Iâ A rather urgent demand
from shorts just at the opening owing to con
tinued hot weather and lighter receipts than
; expected advanced the price of corn %c over
the close yesterday on the initial transactions.
i The condition of the crop In Nebraska, how
| ever, appeared to be the chief consideration
; with the traders. Kansas corn was In bad or !
â  worse condition than in Nebraska, but the
trade had already accepted the damage reports !
| from Kansas, and did some buying because ]
i of them during the last short bull campaign. \
It needed another big corn State to be heard \
from dlscouraglngly as to Its crop prospects
to thoroughly stir up the bulls. Nebraska's
great disappointment, as compared with her
early prospects for a big " crop came oppor
tunely, and the only Incentive to the buying.
At the close December showed an advance of
%@%e.
Chicago received 193 cars of wheat, against
220 as expected. The weather was hot and con
sidered unfavorable for corn, and that article
was strong at the commencement of the ses
sion. There was a geneal feeling of confidence
expressed on the curb that under circumstances
December wheat was low enough. In conse
quence the opening trades were at about %0
improvement over closing prices of last night.
No wheat hod been tendered on September
contracts before the opening. This fact helped
In the formation of the slightly bullish tone
with which trading started. On the other haiÂ»d
Liverpool came Vi@%c lower. Corn soon began
to drop a little of its early advance, and that
with the decline at Liverpool and heavy North
west receipts had to receive the consideration
It was entitled to at the hands of the wheat
speculators. . As a result the .small advance at
the start was lost. Business was small and the
heat was too oppressive for any one to mix
himself in the sweltering crowd. At the close
December showed an advance of %<&'ftc on the
day. '. â¢
Oats were easy early, but toward the close
the strength displayed by corn was . felt, and
the market closed steady, unchanged to %c
higher.
Provisions were depressed at the start from
the knowledge that about 10,000 tierces of
lard had been delivered on September contracts
before " the session opened. The opening de
clines brought forth buyers who absorbed all
that was for sale at the moderate concessions
made when trading first started. Pork ad

DRIED FRUITS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, Sept. I.â The Journal of Com
merce says: There continues a steady but
: quiet Jobbing movement In most lines of dried
j fruits, but the market at the moment lacks
features of special interest. At present there
I seems to be no speculative Interest. Larger
buyers of prunes and raisins are holding off,
: awaiting opening prices, which It Is expected
wiU be made in a day or two. Such business
: as Is reported Is chiefly In small lots needed
to cover Immediate consumption. It Is re
i ported that local seeders have made liberal
I purchases of loose Muscatel raisins of late,
! closely absorbing the spot supply of desirable
I qualities of old goods, but the facts have not
I been allowed to come to the surface.

LIFE SAVED
BY AN INCH
Three Bullets Grazed
Mrs. Needham's Arms.
XIHLMEYER IS NOW IN JAIL
WAS AT HOMF WHEi; SHOTS
WERE FIRED.
As No One Will Swear to a Positive
Statement the Prisoner Will
Probably Have to B#
Released.
-Â» Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
Broadway, Sept. 1.
T'nless Danny Needham on hia return
from the Klondike shall take the law into
his own hauls and do somo gunning.
With the assailant of b s wife as a tar
get. It Is not likely that anything will
come of tho attempted tragedy of last
night. Mrs. Needham remained silent,
and the police have not yet persuaded
her to procure a warrant for the arrest
of Louis Kihlmeyer, who has frequently
annoyed her, but who declares he knows
nothing of the shooting last night. Kihl
meyer, however, is in custody.
Since Needham has been in Alaska
some one wrote him an anonymous letter
about bis wife, which be forwarded to
her, and the writer of this letter, it is
surmised, may know something of the at
tempt to murder Mrs. Needham.
Kihlmeyer resides at 828 Grove street,
and Is a painter. 1 When seen at his
home to-day he said: "I certainly Deyer
shot at Mrs. Needham, because 1 had no
reason to, even if 1 were disposed to go
gunning. I was at home last night a
big part at the evening, and remained
th^re till lv o'clock, Lying down the
greater part of the time. At 10 o'clock
1 went to the V< nezia gardens on Sev
enth street, near JeffiFrson. I played
cards there with Jeff Scanlan, Joe Ad
ams and one of the proprietors, leaving
there about midnight, when 1 went
hon,'
ctlve Denny Holland has made a
thorough investigation of the case to
day, and as a result he decided to take
Kihlmeyer into custody, although there
me doubt whether a complaint will
be sworn to.
"1 had a long talk with Mrs. Need
ham this morning," said the detective,
"und although she is convinced in her
ob a mind of thi Identity of the party
who shot at her. hli.- dli I â  him.
and consequently cannot swear to his
Identity. She certainly had the narrow
scape from being murdered 1 have
ever Been. Had shÂ»- stood with her back
toward the window instead of standing
Hdeways she would now be dead; noth
ing could have- saved her. Any of the
bullets would have caused her death.
They passed within an Uich of her.
"The fellow, whoever he was, must
have stood dose to the window, because
the manner In which the bullets were
Battened shows that they were shot not
far from the wall from which we ex
tracted them.
"Kihlmeyer admits that he was a lit
tle Infatuated with Mrs. Needham, but
Bhe had told him he was making a fool
of himself, and he had not sense' enough
to take her advice His Bisters and moth
er, declare that he was at home at the
time of the shooting, but if he went from
bis home to the Venezia gardens he had
to pass the vacant lot at the rear of
Mrs. Needham's house.. whence the shoot
ing was done. He says he didn't "do it,
and as no one saw any one do it, that Is
ns far as the matter can go."

URY DEMANDS
A SPEEDY TRIAL
Dress Parade Causes
Justice to Lag.
THE JUDGE IS POWERLESS

James Meadors Secures One Day's
Respite Because of a Fancy
Drill at Camp
Barrett-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 1.
A dress parade at Camp Barrett clash
ed with the course of justice to-day in .
Judge Lawrence's court, and James
Meudors, who murdered Jonas Uryi. ob-r
tamed one more day's respite from what
ever judgment may ultimately be pro
nounced against him. â¢ V : '
Court convened as usual, the prose
cuting attorney wad present and: attor
ney Eugene Deuprey was on hand to de
fend Meadors when the Constable- an
nounced that no witnesses would be
available to-day, owin.g to a fancy drill
being given at Camp Barrett, which oct
cupied the attention of the officers and
privates who are to give evidence In the
case. :. .'â â â â¢..'â  â¢;â â ;â¢
Judge Lawrence held a little consulta
tion with the attorneys as to whether or
not Captain Barnes, of Petaluma, and
other officers were not amenable to the
su bpenaes of a township Justices' court.
The Constable joined in the argument.
and stated that when he approached the
lines Ik* was met by Sentries with iixed
bayonets, and that he did not think it
wise for the sake of a half-dollar per
subpena to (as he expressed it) "go up
against the United States army" at his
own personal risk. â¢â¢â â¢â¢â 
.Daniel Dry, untie of the murdered sol
dier, addressed the court, and stated that
he was opposed, to any more delay, as
he wanted the case to be put right
through. Eugene Deuprey, apparently
not recognizing Mr. Dry, asked the court
if the last speaker were a new attorney
brought into the case, and with whom
he (Deuprey) was not acquainted. The
Judge explained Mr. Ury's position, ar.d
Deuprey subsided.
The court finally said: "It appearing
to this court that several important wit
nesses now in the service of the United
States cannot be reached with subpe
naes or bench warrants, and It further
appearing that it may not be within the
province of this court to dictate to the
military officials of Camp Barrett, it ia
ordered that the case of the people
against Meadors be continued until Sat
urday.",
This morning some of the staff officers
from San Francisco went to Camp Bar-,
rett to inspect ..Ve troops, and military
rules required that the -captain of each
company should be on. parade. This pre
vented Captain Billy Barnos, San. Fran
dsco's District Attorney, and the com
mander of the Petaluma company, from
exercising his own discretion in the prem
iss, and therefore Justice Lawrence had
to adjourn his court. . â

YOUNGBERG FIXES THE
BLAME ON ENEMIES
WHY HE WAS EXCLUDED FROil
THE REVENUE OFFICE.
The Broker Knew of the Stuffing of
Welburn's Payroll, Having
Acted, as a Substitute.
Collector Jacksoni has been. Informed
that- the sentence at exclusion passed by
the Secretary of the Treasury .last
: Wednesday rtior-ning on .Customs Broker
John- F... yoi;ngberg- .does, not. apply to'
â  the Custom House.: the' exclusion being
merely from the office of the Collector' of
Internal Revenue. -In that department he.
will riot be allowed' to do business- any
longer, unless the department should see'
fit to ifevefse the .ruling....
Captain Young-berg said' yesterday that
the movement against hirii was the result
â of persona] feeling on the part of some
person whom he did not desire to. name.
He would have his' appeal perfected with
in a few days, pendm-g which time he did
not care to discuss the matter. ' With
. reference to the Akins .matter which
formed the chief reason why he has. been
ostracized from the pleasant paths of In
ternal revenue, business, he said that
Akins was a nephew of his whose name
had been put by Wt-lburn on the pay roll,'
It was alleged, 'as a dummy. This." how
ever, was not the fact, .for Young-berg
did all of Akins' work' in the office.
"You see," iie added, "when Mr. Wel
burn took charge of the office he turned
out all the Republicans and would not al
low a Republican t<> â  work under him.
â He. did not like my -name to appear on
the pay. roll for that reason, and the
name of my -nephew, Charles Akins, was
i-uUstituted on ' the rolls. I will explain
that matter to the department."
A speculation in sheep pelts was next
Bjpoken of, Mr. Youngberg did not know
whether that case had been urged against
him, but he did not believe that- it had.
Some one imported a lot of sheep, pelts' to
Seattle. Finding no purchaser thore .they
"\\ i re shipped to this dlty and were . de
tained by the' Collector of Customs on the
ground that there was something wrong
with them; in fact that p.n attempt had
been m'ai'le to . deceive <he Collector by
falsely stating the. length of . the â¢ wool.
After the goods were detained by the
Collector, Captain- Youngberg was en
gaged by the owner of the pelts to at
tend to-thi-m. He had absolutely noth
ing to do with the pelfs before [ their ar
rival in this city.
â¢ Tt was reported at tho time of the "vVel
burn trial, and before thÃt, that' special
agents of the Treasury "were on the track
o-f Youngberg for his connection with
\V> iburn as adviser and for his participa
tion in the- Akins dummy affair. The re
fiuired proof could not be obtained, and
he was not prosecuted. The agents, how
ever, have been working with the authori
ties in Washington and their efforts have
at last boen crowned with success.
Notes From the Courts.

a transport have been removed she will
go on the drydor-k. and later to. the
U-nion Iron Works. She will not go Into

BROUGHT GOLD HUNTERS FROM BOSTON
â  The schooner Mildred E with a company of men bound for the Klon
dike .aboard arrived in port yesterday. It took her seventy-eight days to
reach the Straits of Magellan from Boston and nearly one hundred days
to come from that place to San Â£ rancisco. She -was for eleven days in a
pampero' off the Biver Platte, and the gold hunters had a terrible time
of it. At Sand Point they sold their cargo of coal and took in sand bal
last. In the Pacific they had fair weather to July 16, and then they had
' nothing but light winds and calms to port. The vessel will be repro
viaioned and the men will outfit here, after which they will oontinue

class during the past two days In the â 
lecture hall of the San Francisco Poly- â 
clinic on Ellis street. Of the thirty- â 
five or more who signed the Red Cross â¢
roll to attend the course of lecture* â¢
jriven at the Polyellnic by leading phy- â¢
sicians and nurses, over three-fourths â 
have attended and have reaped a -
varied knowledge of the duties which â 
would fit them to care for the boys In â¢

hospital.
Ml9s Patton was yesterday assisted
hv Miss Mclaughlin and Mlsb Kelly.
First she Invited a student to act as
â patient, and then called on different â 
ones who had attended her claaa the
previous day to perform the work of a
skilled nurse, under different condi
tions of illness. Miss Patton Instruct
ed her pupils how to apply bandages,
fomentations, poultices'; how to admin
ister, medicine, take respiration, pulse â¢
and temperature, and in . fact do' all
things made necessary by tho needs of
pati-ents. ' During, her. remarks she
left Manila for . San Francisco or not.
but there will be plenty of time to over
haul h<Â»r, as the schedule does not call
for her departure for Hongkong until
November 10. â  ' .
All the steamers are scheduled to call
at Honolulu both coming arid going In
s Plt.Â«_of the fact, that three of them fly
. the British and three- the Japanese flag,
while the China only procured a Hawa
iian regtetrv a few months ago. From
this it would appear as though there is
to be. a special clause in the constitution
of the new territory allowing foreign.ves
sÂ«>ls bound to San Francisco to carry pas
sengers and freight to and from that
point, for the time being.
The steamers of the Toyo Klsen Kabu
shiki Ka.isha are how being completed
in. -England,.' They are fine new vessels,
about the same size as the China, and
will be splendidly fitted out.' The Nippon
Maru and â  Hongkong Maru are sister
ships, built by Sir. J. Lang of Sunderland,
..Englflnd. They are 421 feet long, 50 feet
7 inches broad and 29 fpet 7 inches deep.
(The China is 440.4 feet- long. 48.1 feet

Maru was built by C! S. Swan & Hunter
Co., Limited, of Newcastle. England, and
is 412 feet long. 30 feet 6 inches broad and
29. feet 6 Inches deep. All three vessels
are twin screw and are expected to be

ANOTHER RAFT IS BROKEN.
The Tugs Monarch and Bescue Are
Bringing the Remains Into
Port.
Another big raft has broken up and
will be towed into port In sections. The
tut; Monarch went along all right with It
until off Coos Bay, when it began to show
signs of breaking. As soon as the collier
Czarina brought this news the tug Res
cue was sent to the Monarch's assistance
and arrived just in time. At n a. m. yes
terday the collier Arcata sighted both
tugs, and the raft was then in two pieces,
and each tug had a portion in tow. The
sections should reach here this morning.
Captain Backus of the bark Edward
May is not much in love with Vladivo
stok. He went there from this port with
a. general cargo and says the place is al
moet deserted. Nearly all the shipping
has gone to Port Arthur, and the mer
chants have followed. It does not cost
much to work a vessel at the Siberian
port, according to Backus. He paid the
boss stevedore 87 kopek (about 43 cents)
a day for each man he hired. How much
of that was given to the men the captain
can't tell. Two of the crew of the Ed
ward May deserted. They were San Fran
cisco boys from Telegraph Hill, and, says
Captain Backus, "why they wanted to
desert in that God-forsaken country
is a mystery to me. There was nothing
for them to do, and no one there who
could speak Enellsh, so they will have a
hard time of it, I'm thinking." The Ed
ward May brought a load or wheat here
from Seattle on her return trip.
Three young fellows â¢ who had been
drinking more or less water front whisky
| took Jack Hurley's Whitehall yesterday
' and went for a sail. They took a bottle
1 of whisky with them, and paid more at
j tention to it than to the boat. They
, finally capsized the Whitehall, and had it
j not been for Tommy Crowley, who went
I to their assistance, all would have been
drowned. Captain McKenele, on the
ferry steamer San Rafael, saw them
struggling in. the water and prepared to
go to their assistance, but when he saw
| Crowley heading for the boat he kept on
his con rag.'
The Oceanic Steamship Company's

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1898.
TROUBLES OF
THE SEVENTH
CALIFORNIA
The Officers and Men
Are at Outs.
DISAPPOINTMENT AND FEVER
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TELE
GRAPHS THE PRESIDENT.
1
The Friends of the Regiment Are
Now Making Every Possible
Effort to Have the Men
Mustered Out. *
The medical board of Inquiry appointed
by Brigadier General Miller, and consist
ing of Surgeons Moseley, Raymond and
Smith, began its work yesterday morning
of investigating the origin and spread of
disease at Camps Merrltt and Merrlam.
The first step was the examination of tne
"sick reports" of the various regiments
and a partial sanitary inspection of the
camp at the Presidio, the hospital tent
and the post hospital. The facts will not
be given to the public until after they
have been reported to General Miller.
The principal interest of the investiga
tion centers in the condition of the Sev
enth California Regiment, which, It is
said, will be made the subject of a special
inquiry, of the most rigid character, owing
to the alleged concealment of numerous
cases of typhoid fever for a length of
time altogether unwarranted by a sur
geon supposed to have the requisite
knowledge for the ' prompt and correct
diagnosis of such a well-deflned disease
as typhoid. The charge is made against
Dr. Choate, the surgeon of the regiment
that he allowed twenty cases to accumu
late on his hands before he made the fact
known that typhoid was prevalent in the
command. Several times the fact tnat
typhoid was raging In the regiment was
published in the newspapers, and each
time Dr. Choate and Colonel Berry came
out with a statement that typhoid was
not epidemic in that regiment, the infer
ence being that if typhoid existed at all 1.
was only in Isolated cases. It was also
given out that the percentage of sickness
was by no means alarming, as it was no
greater than in other regiments. This
however, was soon shown not to be li
accord with the facts, and it is now
known that no regiment has had any
where near the number of nick men ant
deaths as the Seventh California.
Owing to the alarming increase of sick
ness and the disappointment at not being
sent to Manila, the discontent among the
men of the Seventh California is increas*
Ing from day to day. The general senti
ment of the enlisted men is in favor o
an immediate mustering out. The officers
who are drawing large salaries are nat
urally opposed to the movement. Colone
Berry has made himself the subject of
considerable severe criticism by his oppo
sition to the well-known wishes of his
men. whose complaints are well grounded.
He nas made himself conspicuous by his
published estimate of the Secretary of
War, whom he calls "a small man,"
and at all the friends of the Seventh who
are endeavoring to have them mustered
out he has flrea a broadside In the shape
of a pronunclamento warning them to
keep their hands off, as he and his fellow
omcers are "not in need of ooldfooted
meddlers to show us the way to be mus
tered out."
So the merry war goes on between
Colonel Berry and hia officers on the one
hand, and the enlisted men and their
friends on the other.
It is safe to say that over 90 per cent of
the enlisted men are desirous of returning
to their homes, and although mustering
out petitions have been destroyed for
fear of the signers being punished, a pe
tition circulated to-day would be signed
by nearly every man In the regiment.
However, their friends are now at work
more vigorously than ever as a result of
Colonel Berry's antl-mustering out pro
clamation, and no one need be surprised
at the early discharge of the regiment
from the service. Hugh Craig, president
of the Chamber of Commerce, has tele
graphed to the President In regard to the
troops at the Presidio as follows:
Neglect has caused much unnecessary suffer
ing and death among their ranks, which will
probably continue unless they are housed In
comfortable barracks before winter. Many of
these men have left good positions, and now
that an early peace Is assured desire to re
turn to their homes as s<x>n as the country
can safely spare them. In two of the regi
ments, we are Informed, a respectful petition
from privates requesting early discharge has
been destroyed by officers and the men threat
ened with arrest. We respectfully request that
the wishes of the private soldiers In the regi
ments be first considered, and that those who
may desire to return to their homes be al
low'od to do so ac soon as public safety will
permit.
The people of Southern California are
Indignant at the treatment received by
the Seventh Regiment, and It has been
suggested that a mass-meeting be held
at Lob Angeles to give expression to their
sentiments and to take some action look
ing toward the relief of the men. One
of the newspapers of Los Angeles ex
presses the opinion that whether or not
Colonel Berry Is court-martialed for his
profane criticism of hie superior officer
It Is probable that he will be subjected to
an official Investigation to determine what
share of responsibility rests upon him for
thf miserable condition of his men. At
least an investigation will be demanded.
The complete Isolation of the Seventh
Regiment is now under consideration, and
it may be moved over to Oakland In the
hope that the change in location will put
an end to the typhoid fever and otherwise
generally Improve the health of the com
mand.
The regimental officers, who seem to
have formed themselves into a mutual
protective association, held a secret
meeting yesterday morning and discussed
the situation, but to what conclusion they
came as to the mustering out question
is not known to outsiders.
J. R. Newbcrry, chairman of the Los
Angeles "war board," left for Washing
ton yesterday morning with the object
of securing the mustering out of the reg
iment, as he has been assured that such
is the desire of the men.
General Miller yesterday received a dis
patch from Adjutant General Corbin direct
ing that a report be Immediately obtained
as to the condition of the Seventh Cali
fornia, and that evory possible remedy
be applied to the relief of the men. This
order, for such it really is. was caused
by an appeal from Senator White that
the regiment be either mustered out or
relieved from Its "unspeakable duties."
General Miller at once personally inspect
ed the regiment, and called upon Colonel
Berry for an Immediate report, which
was furnished, giving the following
facts:
Number of men sick with typhoid fe
ver oh August 23. 15; suspected cafses, 11:
number of sick, 73. Number of sick with
typhoid fever on September 1, 17; num
ber of sick, 75.
Number of deaths during the month
of August, 6, from the following causes:
Typhoid fever, 3; pneumonia, 2; hemor
rhage; 1.
Total number of deaths Bince May 9,
The condition as to dally increase of
sickness during the last seven days Is
indicated by the following data:
Number on sick roll August 25. 17; 26th,
3- 27th, 4; 28th. 3; 29th, 4; 30th, 3; 31st, 3;
September 1, 2.
The report goes on to say that "a de
crease in the sickness from this time on
Is apprehended. This apprehension is
based upon the history of tne past week,
and upon the fact that the condition of
the men in camp has been Improved. By
wav of explanation it should be stated
that the regiment moved from Camp Mer
ritt to Camp Merriam on the 24th, and
that of the seventeen which appear on
the hospital record on the 25th, nine were
convalescents, and were only put in the
hospital for care during the night. Eight
of the seventeen returned to their quar
ters the next day."
Upon receiving Colonel Berry's report
General Miller at once replied to Gen
eral Corbln's dispatch, detailing the
amount of siÂ«krress in the command, and
stating that the usual remedies, such as
a oToan camp and the removing of the
kitchens from the sleeping tents and the
daily burning of garbage, were being ob
served.
THE EIGHTH REGIMENT.
Prospects of a March to San
Jose for Admission Day. ,
CAMP BARRETT, Bather Tract, Aug.
31.â The boys of the Eighth Regiment are
elated over the prospect of a march to
San Jose to participate in the celebration
of Admission day. Brigadier General
Miller is expected over from San Fran
cisco to-morrow to Inspect Camp Bar
rett, and then it will be definitely deter
mined whether or not the regiment will
march to the Garden City.
"If It is decided that we go," said one
of the officers to-day, "we will leave on
the morning of September 6, so that there
will be plenty of time to camp on the
Journey.''
It is expected, too, that the men will get
their pay before they proceed on the
march. The payroll was being completed
to-day, and will be sent to San Francisco
to-morrow. There is a little over two
months' pay due tho men of the Eighth,
and about $70,0<w will be paid out.
Quartermaster Heller, assisted by Cap
tuln Elliott and Lieutenant Meggett,
has been very busy the past two days
distributing the light new canvas uni
forms among the men. These are very
serviceable and are intended to save the
wear and tear of the blue uniforms. The
arrival of these canvas suite Is regarded
by many as proof that it is only a matter
of time before the regiment will be off
for Honolulu.
Colonel Henshaw'a hopes aro not wan
ing. He Bays if more men are needed in
Porto Rico he has the strongest hopes
that his regiment will be chosen for that
expedition.
The Red Cross ladiea are still actively
engaged ministering to the wants of the
soldiers.
Signal service practice is had every day
now, and considerable headway is being
made in this line, which is usually par
ticipated in by a detail of four men from
each company and a commissioned officer.
A rumor started this morning to the
effect that Camp Barrett was to be moved
to San Jose has been denied by Lieuten
ant Colonel Carrington.
A Red Cross Presentation.
After dress parade yesterday afternoon
the boys of Company B, Sixth Califor
nia Regiment, presented a gold medal
to Miss Wallis of the San Francisco Red
Cross Society as a token of their ap
preciation of the attention shown them.
The medal represents cross-guns, with
regimental number and company letter
interwoven, and there is pendent a gold
drop with an enameled red cross. Cap
tain William Bruce made the presenta
tion, assisted by Lieutenant Eaton.
Hospital Visits Regulated.
Major Matthews, surgeon commanding
the Division Hospital, has issued an or
der that no visitors will be admitted to
the hospitals to visit patients except on
Tuesdays and Saturdays between 2 and
4 p. m. Only passes from the command
ing officer will be recognized. This or
der, however, does not apply to parents.
WILL ADMINISTER
SUTRO'S ESTATE
MRS. DR. MERRITT AND W. R. H.
ADAMSON WIN A POINT.
Their Application for Special Letters
Met With Some Opposition, but
Judge Coffey Granted
Their Prayer.
Heirs of Adolph Sutro, who. dissatisfied
with their legacies, have determined to
contest the will of the dead millionaire,
met with their first defeat yesterday
morning in Judge Coffey's court. Con
trary to their wishes Dr. Emma L. Mer
ritt and William R. H. Adamson were
granted special letters of administration
upon the vast estate of the decedent,
and an application of Edgar E. Sutro and
P. A. Morbio to be granted authority to
administer the estate was denied.
When the case was taken up for hear
ing Attorneys Wheeler and McEnerney,
representing Edgar E. Sutro, Mrs. Rosa
V. Morbio, Mrs. Kate Nussbaum and
Clara E. Sutro. the contestants, were
present to oppose the application of Dr.
Emma Merritt and Adamson for letters
of administration. They apprised the
court of the impending contest and con
tended that sufficient evidence tending to
support the will had not been produced,
and that in face of the opposition such
letters should not be granted.
On the othsr hand, Lloyd and Wood,
counsel for the executors, contended that
in view of the great valuo of the estate,
in figures $3,000,000, of which $500,000 was
personal property, some one should be
appointed to care for it, lest it suffer
great damage by the omission. In the ap
plication for letters of administration
Mrs. Dr. Merritt, the eldest daughter,
and the oldest son of Adolph Sutro ap
peared as petitioners, and in compliance
with their wishes the application should
be granted.
Mrs. Dr. Merritt and Mr. Adamson took
the stand and gnve evidence tending to
establish their right to administer the es
tate, and the opposition then took the
testimony of Mrs. Morbio simply to show
that she" was among the contestants and
waÃ aware of the wishes of those whom
it was stated entertained her views. To
substantiate the fact that the contestants
wished special letters granted Edgar E.
Sutro and P. A. Morbio presented the fol
lowing document, signed by the contest
ants, which was offered in evidence:
"The undersigned, children and heirs at
law of Adolph Sutro, deceased, and being
persons entitled to letters of administra
tion upon his estate, do hereby request
the court to appoint P. A. Morbio and
Edgar E. Sutro special administrators of
the estate of the said deceased." Mrs.
Morbio Identified the signatures and then
left the stand.
Without further showing or argument
Judge Coffey then granted special letters
to Mrs. Dr. Merritt and Adamson. The
bond of each was fixed at $100,000. The
application for letters testamentary will
be heard next week, unless in the mean
time the contest is perfected and the liti
gants are ready to go to court.

THE CASE HAS CRUMBLED
LIKE A HOUSE OF CARDS
George Haas Sold the Candy
That Became the Mess=
enger of Death.
POLICE ARE AT FAULT.
The Evidence Gathered Against
Mrs. Botkin Vanishes Into
Thin Air.
The fabric of evidence built by the local
police around Mrs. Cordelia Botkin: has
crumbled like a house of cards. Not one
vestige, of the incriminating testimony re
mains.,' and â¢ the. authorities must begin
all over again: . Their energies . have been
misdirected/ "Witnesses that believed they
knew something of the tragic death of
Mrs. Dunning' and ' Mrs..vi>eane have la
bored under a terrible . mistake. Their
knowledge- does not possess.- . even . the
â value of a coincidence. :' ' â  ' 'â â¢ . .'.
;'.: The poisoned candy that brought death
\ to the two unfortunate women In Dover
was bought in this city .and. not in Stock

the local police. . -. : . -.- .'â¢"â¢â " :'â¢â¢-.'â¢ . . â¢.:.-.
=;: The discovery means more .than, a
change in the scene. of operations. It lifts
a" tremendous cloud of : . suspicion '. from
Mrs. Bntkirt, and, while it does not leave
her completely free from the shadow of
guilt, it forces upon, th** authorities .. the
â  necessity of constructing a new. case oil
â very different lines from that so boast
fully presented for the : last two weeks;
The only positive testimony that remains
to confront 'â â¢ Mrs. Botkin is the assertion
of John Dunning that' he believes â¢ the";
woman wrote the -anonymous threatening
letters to his wife.. Even Dunning will
riot' say that the address on the package.

. lion fell: id the ground. â¢â¢ â  ". â  ' â 'â ".
The witnesses, from Stockton positively
3eclared that the box of poisoned' candy,
Had not been bought from them. They
were able : -to say- beyond â  -question that
neither the box . nor the candy had come
irom their shop.- In an instant the Chief
af Police found himself precisely where
be had commenced two weeks ago. â  He
Sad arrested a woman at the instance of
the Delaware authorities/ At their com
â  mand he had charged her .'-with-- murder.
Beyond that â¢ nothing .had been done ex
' :ept to make ,a -most â¢â¢â¢'serious mistake.
The Delaware officers had been told- that
evidence of the most vital character had
oeen secured against Mrs.' Botkin- In this
Dlty and in. Stockton. She had been
identified; the official reports declared," as
the woman who bought the candy; The
jlhcial romance pictured her at the ferry
postal station securing stamps and send
â  jig the .messenger of death on its way.
.- Inspired, by these unwarranted reports'
the Delaware authorities â  chargeu Mrs.
Botkin with murder. All the material
/evidence, they, believed, (was here;, ihey
.-had only the â ' unsupported assertion of
Dunning to. justify them in their action
â  and the local authorities -must. tell them
bo. -. Chief , Lees is more than ever cop
vinced that Mrs. Botkin must be extra-
Sited. '-.He has. nothing with which to'
. lu'stify her. trial for murder in this State..
.' After the witnesses from Stockton had'
â  told their story and bad destroyed all th-e'
hope of. the. prosecution, another Witness
was : summoned/. . He. was George. Mass
. &nd he came to tell the Chief of Police
what he. had already told Detective Gib-.
: - ion,-' that the box and the. caridy ha.d- been
â¢ : purchased at his. establishment, on. Mar
. : ket street... ' The police were', dumfound
' ed, but they, could do nothing but ae

FOB YEABS CUBED
â¢ â  I had Salt Rheum for years. My leg from
tnce to anklo was raw and swollen, and the
pain was intense. I tried doctors in Hartford,
â Waterbury, and New Haven, to no avail. Cc-
â¢ncuÃA Resol.ve>t, Cotichka (ointment),
and a box of CtrnctntA Soap completely
cured me. GARRETT T. BAYERS,
Hartford Electric Light Co., Hartford, Conn.
Deane. I felt sure that the shadow of
suspicion that had been thrown over me
could not long remain. I believe that In
a short time my name will be removed
from all association with this dreadful
affair, and I am more than ever con
vinced that I will not be forced to go to
Delaware.
"I . cannot see how it. is possible, for
Dunning to charge me with the author
ship of those, anonymous- letters, and I
refuse to believÂ« that, he has done so.
There must "be some mistake in the. re
ports. My attorneys give me every, as
surance that the end will not be long
delayed. 1 will tell the police and the
public that I did not buy. the box of poi
soned candy. As far as I know I never
was in Haas' candy store In my life. I
have no fear of investigation. The deep
er and more, thorough the inquiry the
more evident will: my innocence become."
When the new discovery was made .At- .
torney Knight called upon Chief- of Police
Lees arid offered to discuss the situa
tion in a purely friendly way. The law
yer wished to meet .the Chief half way,
to reveal his client's defense and. to learn
what evidence the authorities may pos
sess. If there Is nothing serious against
Mrs. Botkin her attorney would ' like to
secure her immediate release, but this is
Impossible, in. view of the complaints of
murder already made. These charges |
will not be withdrawn,- and the Chief of
Police Will stand by his llrst determina
tion to have the accused woman, extra
dited to Delaware.: As soon as possible ;
after the arrival of the application "for
extradition Chief Lees will appear be- â¢
fore Governor Budd and ask that the
application be granted. Unless some
thing far more .'.material appears in the;
nature of evidence the application is not
likely, to receive favorable consideration !
from the chief executive. '. ' .â¢â¢â .'
Another stumbling block was thrown in
the "way of the prosecution yesterday 'â 
when it became known that the official
expert on handwriting is unable ' to
identify the known handwriting of Mrs;
Botkin either with the anonymous letters
or with the address and note of the candy. ;
box. It is now generally admitted that j
the anonymous letters were not written
by the same person who penned, the ad- |
dress and the., note. If they were, the '
writer was unusually expert in disguising :
her handwriting. The failure of the ex.- i
pert on handwriting to maJte any progress i
of value to the- prosecution is of the most \
serious import. The uncertainty, of the'
expert throws great doubt upon the as
sertion of Dunp ing 'and . undermines the i
case of the State .in its. most vital part.
With the failure of the expert, and the I
crash of the Stockton episode it would .i
seem as if the prosecution had suffered |
reverses enough for one day, but the
'Grand -. Jury was yet to- supply another |
cause for dismay. . The strongest wit- |
nesses discovered by the police were ex- \
amined by the r>fflcial inquis-itors, and.
they could tell nothing 'of â¢ value: They
know nothing that bears directly upon
the. commission of the dreadful, crime:
They are acquainted with the facts of i
Mrs. Botkin's career and know of her re- j
latidns with Dunning. Beyond that they j
are as ignorant . of the motive and the j
perpetrator of the murders as the police'
themselves. â¢ The official inquiry will be
pursued . further, however, with a hope
that some fact of moment may be de
veloped. Unless some startling fact is
brought out it is extremely unlikely that
Mr 6. Botkin will'- ever be indicted .for
sending poisoned- confections- through the
mails. ....'.â  â 
LEES' CHAIN WAS
MADE OF FOG
All the Links of Evidence Gathered
by the Venerable Chief Blown
Away Like Mist.
â  The whole fabric of alleged evidence
that for two weeks past Chief Lees has
been weaving around- Mrs. .Cordelia Bot
kln was yesterday, .so r:erit- and torn that'
riot one shred remains behind which- the
Chief may seek to hide his. chagrin and
disappointment. The whole wobbly struc
ture; of inconsistencies that the prosecur
tlort has. built up around the woman ac
cused of lh.epQ.ver murdershas fallen and'
its; builders are. sadly â¢ niixed up with 'the
ruins. â  â¢ "â¢ , \ ; â¢ .
/Through. .' the â¢ efforts of Detective
.Gibson. the work of. weeks is undone and
the scene of-'deepest investigation Is shift
ed irorn Stockton to San' Francisco and
from the candy -.store of Kuhii to the
store of G. W. Haas. Chief Lees most
bogin anew his- ae-arch. ifor .evidence that
.will Warrant the charge of murder against
Mrs. Cordelia Botkjn. :
; Sipce- the- beginning, despite the many
â absurd inconsistencies that. The Call has
pointed out,' Chief Lees: and â  Detective
McVey have pursued- the theory of the
Stockton candy box, blind to all possi
ble channels of Information outsrde that
theory. L'sing the drag net they have
this last week gathered in from Healds
burg and from .Stockton their witnesses
and their, .clews, and one by one their
witnesses have developed that they knew
nothing and their clews have dissipated
Into -thin .air.
Mrs. Rauof, who has been largely ad
vertised as one of the brightest of the
gaLaxy of the prosecution's stars, knew
little and told nothing when on Tuesday
she Was brought by Detective Wreim
from Healdsburg and subjected to the
sweat box by the Chief's board of- strat
egy. Miss Lizzie Livernash submitted all
of the evidence that she. had not, and
the efforts of the inquisition adduced as
much from the other channels, of which
Station D of the Postofllce Department
was the most Important.
Then, to complete the ruin of the Chief's
unique theory, came, like a bolt from the
skies, word from Detective Gibson that
the box and its contents, the ribbon and
the wrapping, had been fully identified by
George Haas, the well-known Market
street candy man, as the output of his
store; furthermore, that his establish
ment Is the only one on the coast which
uses euch o. box.
For two days Detective Gibson had
been displaying among the different con
fection-shops the box and its attach
ments, but with no result until he placed
It before one of the ten pretty girls of
the Haas establishment. She immediate
ly recognized It as one of fne store boxes
as did all of her co-workers to whom it
was shown. To clinch his sudden good
fortune Oibson called In Mr. Haas, who
corroborated the statements of his em
ployes.
"I recognized not only the box but the
candy as soon as It was shown me," said
Mr. Haas. "We are the only people on
the coast who use the box, which Is
made by Jones & Co. of Philadelphia. I
was summoned by Chief Lees early tins
morning to the City Hall, where, with a
strong magnifying glass, I made a most
minute observation of the box and Its
contents, and 1 did not hesHate to say to
the Chief that the box and the candy
were without doubt from my store. One
feature of the box which makes my Iden
tification doubly sure Is that the box Isâ
or wasâ pink and not white in color, as
has been reported. This I proved to Mr

! Lees by fearing a piece of the paper and
; showing' him the obverse, side. The
' change in color is accounted for by the
': fact that I buy. my boxes in a' great
I quantity at one time and store them for
! six months or more. The color is one
that quickly fades. I reiterate that the
candy and the box are from my store."
1 With the object .of finding one among
1 the girls in the store who could recall
i some unusual circumstance in connection
: with the sale of the box in question. De
tectives McWy and Gibson called at the'
! store, and besides displaying â  the box
thoroughly catechised every employe of
; the place, but to no avail. ' They one and
: all recognized the box, but that was all.
j To-day or to-morrow, as the plan stands
now, Mr. Haas and his employes will be
; takÂ«'n to the Central police station to see
lif there be one among them who can
! identify Mrs. Botkin as the. erstwhile cus
: tomer of the store.
To say that Chief Lees was stunned at
I this sudden collapse of his evidential
. structure is a poor expression for the
stroke that the head of the department
| suffered. For a time he refused abso
| lutely. to. believe that Detective Gibson's
i clever discovery was more than a coin
cidence, and with all the happy faith of
another childhood, and by the power pur
loined from the Grand Jury, he haled be
fore him W. F. Kuhn, the proprietor,
I and F. G. Gattrell and Raymond Miller,
clerks of the Wave candy store of Stock
ton'.
Gattrell, it will be remembered, an
nounced that he had been approached by
| a woman who wanted an empty candy
i box in which to place some of her own
j confections. As to consent to such a re-
I quest was contrary to the policy of the
store, Gattrell procured for the woman
another box. and with It she left. This
upon the 25th or 29th of July.
Upon this showing Chief Lees had hung
his faith, and until 10 o'clock yesterday
morning, when Mr. Kuhn arrived, there
his faith hung. A glance at the box and
another at the candy, and Chief Lees
learned that the work and the worry, the
star chamber conclaves and the torch
light investigations of a long month were
for naught, and that from the hour he
must begin afresh to elaborate the same
theory with facts from different channels.
The box was not from Kuhn'sâ nor was
the candy.
Of his connection with the case Mr.
Kuhn. who is a business man typical of
the hustling San Joaquin Valley, talked
freely. "I saw at a glance," he said,
"that neither box nor candy was of my
stock. In fact I came to the conclusion
that they were not as soon as I road the
description of- the thinps In The Call, and
.1 ho notified the. authorities. It is non
sense, to say that -a candy-maker cannot
recognize .his own candles. Tie can, just
as readily as a tailor -.can recognize his
clothing. Chief Lees was positive that he
â¢had .discovered amonp the chocolates the
â  mark of the lopsided mold which I had
described, but I found no trouble in point
ing out to him his mistake. I think that
he Is now of the opinion that the candy
did no.t come from Stockton."
Investigation proved that the Chief cer
tainly was of that opinion, so much so
that * Gattrell and -Miller were tendered
' their' expenses and returned to Stockton
with not so much as an audience.
EVIDENCE BEFORE
THE GKAND JURY
Chief Lees Asks That Mrs. Botkin Be
. Indicted Under Section 347 of
the Penal Code.
Yesterday afternoon Chief Lees and
Detective McVey presented to the Grand
Jury all the evidence so far gathered in
the Dunning case. The object of their
move Is to secure an indictment against
tire. Botkin under section 347 of the
Penal Code, which makes it a felony for
a person- to send poisoned food through
the malls. An indictment for murder will
not be asked for by Chief Lees, as that
would defeat his purpose to send the ac
cused woman to Delaware, if he can pos
sibly do so. â¢
If Mrs. Botkin were Indicted for mur
der she would have the right to demand
a trial here, and should she be acquitted
she could not again be placed in jeopardy
on the same charge. The plan of the po
lice is to secure an indictment on the
minor charge, thereby taking the case out
of the Jurisdiction of the Police Court and
then hold the prisoner indefinitely.
If sufficient evidence to fasten the mur
dÂ«r of Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane upon
Mrs. Botkin could be obtained subse
quently, the Indictment would be quashed
and extradition might then follow.
Yesterday's proceedings seem strange
from the fa^t that If the police can show
reasonable or even presumptive proof that
Mrs. Botkin deposited the death package
In the mail her guilt of murder would be
indicated and she should be tried on that
charge.
The Grand Jury devoted four hours to
the case yesterday and adjourned subject
to a call for a special session. It was
learned that no startling evidence was
presented by the prosecution, and an in
timation was given by a Juror that a bill
against Mrs. Botkin was not likely to be
brought unless the police produced mora
definite evidence than has so far been
presented. Acting District Attorney Hos
mer conducted tue case for Cnlef Lees
and Detective McVey.
The witnesses examined were Chief
Lees, Detective McVey, Mrs. Rauof, the
nurse: Mrs. Louise Seeley and Miss Liv
ernash, a reporter who interviewed the
accused woman at Healdsburg and
Stockton before sne was arrested.
Chief Lees was the first witness, and
he gave the Grand Jury a detailed state
ment of the case, including the telegrams
he had received from the Delaware au
thorities, which contained the informa
tion that Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane
had been killed by eating candy contain
ing-arsenic, which had been sent to Dover
from San Francisco. He also nresented
a subsequent message asking him to ar
rest Mrs. Botkin. which he had done.
The Chief then pave his theory of the
crime and Mrs. Botkin's connection there
with. He then presented photographs of
the anonymous letters alleged to have
been written by Mrs,' Botkin to Mrs. Dun
ning-, and also reproductions of the note
â and superscription on the box of candy.
The Chief could not present the testi
mony of experts on the handwriting, as
comparisons have not yet been made.
Detective McVey was next called. He
laid before the jury all the evidence he
brought from Dover, which consists sole
ly pf the remainder of the poisoned candy,
the wrapper containing the address, the
box and the handkerchief and note in
closed with the murderous gift.

Mrs "Botkin visited while she was in
NO MORE CHINESE FOR
THE OMAHA VILLAGE
THOSE ON THE WAY WILL NOT
BE LANDED.
Treasury Department Has Notified
Collector Jackson That Its Per
mission Has Been Revoked.
The exposures recently made in The
Call of the fact" that about 200 Chinese ad
mitted at this port on the way to the
exposition at Omaha had escaped and
were living in this State as courtesans
and laborers, have been taken Into con
sideration by the Treasury Department
at Washington. Collector Jackson was
advised ytsterday of the opinion of the
department by a telegram ordering him
to refuse a landing to the remainder of
the Chinese now on their way from
China to Omaha.
Some time ago, upon the representation
of the Mcc Lee Village Company, having
in charge the Chinese village at the
Omaha Exposition, the United States
Government agreed to admit to this coun
try some 50i) and odd exhibitors, dancers*,,
actors, clerks, etc., from China, the Mcc
Lee Company giving bonds that . these
people would be returned to China not
later than two months after the close of
the exposition. Three hundred and twen
ty have been admitted at this port and
twelve more are expected on the steamer
from- Hongkong in a few days. Two hun
dred and fifty are coming by way of
Port TownscnO. Under the tele
graphed instructions received yesterday
all these will be excluded.
The Chinese bureau officials have- not
yet succeeded in finding the eight Chi
nese women who came here from the
Omaha village and became inmates of
disreputable houses. These women were
sold for $2000 each and were imported
here under the pretext that they were
to attend booths in the Mcc Lee village
at the exposition.
Collector Jackson received also a rul
ing of the Treasury Department in the
matter of a Chinese who had a certifi
cate of registration, but who had been
absent from the United States for more
than a year. He sought admission,
despite the one year proviso, on the
ground that he had been detained in
China owing to the serious sickness of
his mother. The department ruled that
this was not a valid excuse, and that the
sickness of no person other than the ap
plicant would relieve him from the oper
ation of the one year limitation clause.
PATRICK SHEA CONVICTED.
Brutal Assailant of Eliza Godecke
Will Meet His Just Deserts.
Patrick Shea has pity only for him
self. On June 16 last he criminally as
saulted Eliza Godecke, a young girl, and
when her aged mother attempted to save
her daughter the rough drove her from
the room, paid no heed to the pleadings
of his young victim and completed his
purpose. Wednesday he was put on
trial, and many witnesses closed a chain
of evidence about him, and yesterday he
was found guilty of the crime with which
he was charged. When the jury returned
its verdict he broke down and cried like
a child: for himself he had naught but
pity, for others none. As there are two
prior convictions against the criminal he
will probably suffer a sentence that will
mean life behind prison bars.
Meyerhof Not Poi3oned.
Autopsy Surgeon Gallagher performed
an autopsy yesterday morning on the
body of Martin M. Meyerhof, the grocer
â¢who fell dead a few days ago at his place
of business on the corner of Mason and
Geary streets. He discovered no traces
of poison in the stomach and found evi
dence that death had been caused Dy
fatty degeneration of the heart. The body
had been embalmed, but despite that fact.
Dr. Gallagher is confident tnat Meyerhof
was not poisoned, as had Oeen suspected
by his friends.
Bead the anecdotes about "Soapy"
Smith by Cy Warman, in next Sun
day's Call.
Stockton, told her story, which has re
peatedly appeared in the newspapers. She
simply related the circumstances of Mrs.
Botkin's visit and illness while she was
at her home. It was supposed, for a
time th.it Mrs. Botkin had confessed to
her nurse, but the latter denies that she
was ever taken into the confidence of the
woman now under arrest.
Mrs. Louise Seeley, a former friend of
Mrs. Botkin and Dunning, who was ac
cused by Mrs. Botkin of being: the author
of the anonymous letters sent to Mrs
Dunning, swore that she had never seen
the letters, much less having written
them. She declared complete igmorance
of their existence until they were referred
to in the newspapers.
Miss Lizzie Livernash, a newspaper
woman gave the details of interviews she
had had with Mrs. Botkin, and the sub
stance of several conversations which
she wa * ln the accused

IN MARTIAL MUSIo
POLICE DRUM CORPS A PALPI
TANT FACT.
The Sextet Composing It Were Once
Butchers, and Now Practice
Their Arts on Do, Re, Mi.
At last a worthy ambition of Chief of
Police Lees is to be gratified. He is to
have a drum corps. When he shall ride
at the head of a procession, all stately
with lace, and like Dante's boatman
"hoar with eld," there Is to be a ratapian
to his glorification. The noise will be
louder than his gold braid, and for all
the attention the rest of the parade will
attract, It might as well go away from
there. It won't be in it.
The corps has been organized. So far
it is untamed, but the trainer has hopes.
It is made up of Policemen Butterworth,
McLaughlin, Webster, Evatt, Hems and
Bunner. The six were practicing in the
shooting gallery at the City Hall yester
day, and the rest of the force was with
difficulty restrained from using them as
targets. The noise was enough to wake
the dead, and would .have done so except
that the dead know a good thing. Suf
fering fell to the living. By a strange co
incidence each of the sextet was, before
his elevation to the upper circles, a
butcher. Each is competent to yank the
sheepskin from the palpitant carcass, but
at hammering melody out of the same
after it has been tanned and stretched
they all are a little lame yet. but expect
to be better before Lees has convicted
Mrs. Botkin.
There is still the painful lack of a flfer.
Nobody on the force seems willing to
yield to others the boon of being a flfer,
and so a contest may be arranged. The
men will run 100 yards, and the one with
the most wind left at the end will be
given the coveted position. The fat men
declare this will not be a fair deal, but
they must take their chances with the
rest. However, there is no absolute need
of a fifer, and there is doubt whether any
man on force could run 100 yards and
have enough breath left to whisper his
own name, much less fife to the mighti
ness of Lees. The drums can do the busi
ness all by themselves, and when they
once get under way "The Drums of the
Fore and Aft" will never again be
thought worthy of mention. Those were
fiction drums anyhow, and these awful
six are the real article.

ton and Second Infantry.
More Chinese Excluded.
Twenty-eight Chinese claimfcig to be
natives of this country and fifty with cer
tificates as traders, accountants, clerks,
etc., were denied a landing yesterday by
Collector Jackson. The men with the cer
tificates were excluded because of the re
cent ruling of the Treasury Department
that none but merchants, students or
tourists for pleasure are entitled to land.
These men cannot take an appeal, the
judgment of exclusion on the part of the
Collector being final, but the Chinese
claiming to be native Yankees have the
right of appeal. Four asked for writs of
habeas corpus yesterday and writs will
be issued.

JONAS URY WAS A
DISINHERITED SON
WAS A HEBREW AND MARRIED
A CHRISTIAN.
Came to San Francisco and Enlisted
and Was Murdered at Camp
Barrett.
The cause that led Jonas Try, who was
killed at Camp .barren by James Mead
ors, to leave New York City and come to
San Francisco was the estrangement .of
his father, due to the son's marriage In
opposition to the parental wishes.
Jonas was the eldest son of Fenx Ury,
a well-to-do baker and caterer on Lenox
avenue, New York. He fell in love with
the pretty daughter of a janitress. Jonas
was an orthodox Hebrew and the young
woman was a Christian. That's where the
trouble arose.
"Jonas, my son, If you marry that
Christian girl I'll disown you," said the
old man. "Such a marriage will Tove un
happy."
Nevertheless Jonas married the girl,
and sure enough his father kept his word,
despite the pleading of the boy's mother.
Without assistance from the paternal
purse Jonas was unable to properly pro
vide for his wife, who soon after the
birth of their child summoned him into
court to answer to the charge of non
support. The delinquent husband pleaded
that in order to support his wife and child
he would sell the clothes he was wearing
and go naked, but the proceeds resulting
from this transaction would not keep
the wolf from the door any great length
of time. Jonas also set up the plea that
his father, the baker, had refused to
give him any more money, and that try
as hard as he might he could earn noth
ing.
Jonas was dismissed by the Judge and
soon after he came to San Francisco and
appealed for assistance to an uncle lit4ng
here. The uncle, however, took the same
stand as the father. He would not help
Jonas because he had married a Christian
girl. At last the disinherited heir of the
house of I'ry became desperate and en
listed in the Eighth California Regiment
of Volunteers. A few weeks after he was
stabbed to death by James Meadors in a
quarrel over a trivial amount of money.
When the telegraphic announcement' of
the death of Jonas was received by his
father the old man refused to discuss
his son's marriage ana persisted in speak
ing of him as though he had died single.
A PRINTING FIRM ATTACHED.
Francis, Valentine & Co. Could Not
Withstand Their Heavy Losses
by Fire and Otherwise.
Several heavy attachments have been
filed against the plant of Francis,.Valen-
tine & Co., at Clay and Sansome streets.
The first given to the Sheriff was in la
vor of the Donohoe-Kelly Banking Com
pany to secure a debt for $15,112 79. The
second, filed late yesterday afternoon,
was by the paper firm of Blake, Moffltt 6c
Tqwne, and was for $735" 99.
Francis, Valentine & Co. is one ot the
largest concerns in the theatrical printing
business on the Pacific Coast. Several
years ago the secretary. E. C. -Goggin,'
fled to Europe, having embezzled a large
amount of money. Later came. two fires,
which caused heavy losses and seriously
crippled the concern. The partners are S.
B. Valentine and Howard P. Taylor- Jr.
A meeting of creditors will be called
without delay.
Friends of Dumb Beasts.
The office of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals has been re
moved from Sixteenth street to the fourth
floor of the Parrott building. To-morrow
evening there will be a housewarming
and the friends of the organization' have
been invited to attend.
Hereafter the office will be kept open
every Saturday evening from 8 to "11
o clock, and the public bb well as mem
bers and their friends are cordially in
vited to call. The board of trustees- has
a^ tne , P resent tim Â«> under consideration
the advisability of holding at least four
meetings a year of the whole society as
a body, and listening to able addresses'
on the subject of the cruelties practiced
on dumb friends, and to discuss as to
which are the best methods to be em
ployed in preventing them. Such meet
ings will no doubt bring the noble -work
engaged in more before the public, and
do much to advance the society's inter
ests.

THE LEGACY A GIFT
TO THE MOTHER
MRS. VERONICA C. BAIRD' S AN
SWER TO HER DAUGHTER.
The Stock Transferred by Mrs. Barry
Baldwin Jr. Claimed, by the
Recipient to Be No
. â¢ Trust. â  - â¢' . : â¢".'â 
When Mrs. Veronica C. Baird goesjnto
Judge Hebbard's court to answer the
complaint of her daughter, young Mrs.
Barry Baldwin, in a suit for the fecovr
cry of some $43,000 worth of stock-, thero
is likely to be' adduced as evidence- some
strong- assertions and positive' contra
dictions between mother and daughter. -
The suit was filed 'on "July 19 and the
general demurrer on July 30. Argument
on demurrer has been delayed, owing to
a crowded calendar. When that is 'dis-' .
posed of, as it will most likely, be by bel
ing promptly overruled, the answer witf: :
be filed within the statutory time.
The chief allegation of the answer will
be that the stock was transferred by the
daughter, not merely to be .held in trust,
but as a direct gift to her mother. .N. S.
Hurd, attorney for Mrs. Baird, in giving. !
a reason yesterday for the delay in the
case, declined to discuss the answer .. that
he is preparing, but he did not deny re
liance to a large extent upon the- fact, as
contended by Mrs. Baird, that she : was .
not acting as a trustee for her -daughter,
although while holding the- property, in'
Her own name the holding was for the
benefit of Mrs.' Baldwin as well as her
self. . . â¢ ...- â¢. ..
When young Barry Baldwin was a vis
itor .to the. Baird d.welling he was looked
upon as merely a friendly, visitor, and his
marriage" with . the daughter was not a
matter to be considered â¢ serious.lv.- . :â  So
â¢when it came, it came as a shock, and
Mrs. Baird and her daughter, too, ac
cording to the declarations of the defend
ant, thought -the property that the.young
bride held in her own- name would be -bet
ter in the- hands' of the.mother. The
transfer was duly made. ' â¢â¢" . .â 
â¢ Mrs. Barry Baldwin Jr. is of. mind that :
she' can take of her. own fortune aVleg- '..
acy from her father. John H.. Baird. and
she will stand by.' the; allegations <>f her
complaint: that the '22s shares of Capir
