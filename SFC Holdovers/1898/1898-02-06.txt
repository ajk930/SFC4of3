FRANK BELEW HAS CONFESSED
IN HIS LONELY CELL
WITH A CALL REPORTER
THE FIEND BREAKS DOWN
Cries Aloud That He Killed
His Brother and
Sister.
His Friends Fall Away From Him,
and in His Despair He Turns
to Strangers to Ease
His Conscience.
To The Call Reporter:
* 4 I killed my brother and
did it.
In the presence of T. L. Robinson
Under Sheriff, with these words,
signed by his own hand, the
prisoner cowering and sobbing in his
vault-like ceil to-night, has set the seal
of certainty upon his guilt.
During the afternoon the man was
steadily weakening in his resolution.
Friends and brothers had left him, no
lawyer came near. Almost from the in
stant the door had clanged behind him
he had had no word of cheer. The bur
den was growing too heavy to bear.
He tottered under it. But now he has
in a measure cast it off.
As he lies on his blankets he seems
but the wreck of the strong man on
whom the handcuffs were placed on
Friday morning, but he says he will
sleep, that he feels better, that a great
burden has rolled away.
That Belew would make an absolute
confession to-night was almost a cer
tainty. And yet there was no reason
able expectation that he would go into
full details. It appeared probable that.
after making a fatal admission, he
would become scared and decline to go
farther, as half a dozen times he had
reached almost to the final point and
then sought the refuge of silence.
It was this evening that he yielded to
conscience and importunity. The pic
ture of the dungeon was impressive.
Still on his cot, the prisoner was glad
to have company, no matter if before
being left again with his thoughts he
would virtually . have fixed a rope
about his neck.
He looked up and greeted me more
cheerful!}- than had been his wont.
"Frank." I said, "you know you were
almost ready this afternoon to tell me
why you killed your brother and sis
ter. Are you ready now?"
There was a pause, and again came
from the deep chest of the wretched
man a long, shivering sigh. Then he
burst into tears and covered his face
with his hands. ***
"I did it! Oh, I did it!"
he moaned.
"Will you sign a state
ment saying so?"

"I will. It's in me and
has to come out. 1 killed
them!"
Then he signed the paper which ap
pears at the head of this column.
His ringers did not readily grasp the
pencil, nor hold it firmly, but the name
is legible and distinct. The character
istic scrawl of an unpracticed writer.
There was nothing left to save Belew
from the hangman.
"Now, Frank, what is your motive
in telling this?"
"It's just in me and has to come out.
I can't eat or sleep. I am miserable.
It will make me feel better. I know it
will. But lam sorry I killed them."
"What was your reason for doing
it?"
"I had no reason. I cannot under
stand it myself. I don't knew. I would
tell you if I could."
"Were you jealous of their pros
perity?"
"No, I had nothing against them."
" Were you dissatisfied about the di
vision of the estate?"
"I was not. I had no reason. I just
did it, that's all. Now I have no
friends and no hope and I am telling
everything. There is nothing to hide
any more."
"Where did you get the poison?"
"I got it in Dixon about five years
ago."
"At what store?"
"It was so long ago that I forget. I
have had it all the time."
"You didn't get it to kill anybody?"
" Never had such an idea. It was rat
poison."
"And you put it in the kettle?"
"I put it in the kettle, the tea kettle."
""Had there been a quarrel or any
thing unpleasant?"
"No."
"You just put it in the kettle for the
sake of killing somebody?"
"I can't tell."
"Had you been drinking?"
"I do not drink. Nobody ever saw
me drink."

HIS RELATIVES APPALLED.
DIXON, Feb. s.â Arthur and Thomas Belew have decided that their
brother is guilty and not entitled to their financial or moral support.
"I thought you were wrong until now," said Arthur to Constable
Newby to-night, "but his doom is sealed. It is awful. Tommy and I
will not spend our money to help Frank, as it will do no good. He
has murdered the two who were the main spokes in the wheel."
This conversation was in a saloon where Belew had invited Newby
to have a social chat, though he had been bitter toward Newby until
now.
you held her hand?"
For a time Belew could
not answer.
"I was sorry for her. 1
had nothing against her."
"Didn't you feel like a- hypocrite?"
"I. was very sorry. I felt as bad as
any one could have fek. "
"How did you get a chance to use the
poison?".
"Well, some of the folks had gone
out to the gate and I dropped it in
while they were out there."
"You stayed in the house for houn
afterward. How did you feel? Wasn't
there a period of terrible suspense?"
"Yes, there was."
"But you left the poisoned water
there just the same?"
"Yes."
'"Did you have the conversations with
Bird which were printed in The Call
the other day?"
"Yes."
"You made all those admissions to
him?"
"Yes."
"Thinking he wouldn t tell?"
"But I'm telling now, when I know
the whole world will find it out. Bird
told the truth. You know that now."
"You do not feel hard toward the pa
pers, do you?"
"Not toward The Call. It has
treated me right."
"Did anybody know of your crime
until you told Bird?"
"Nobody."
"Were you not afraid of being
caught?"
"Well, I've been caught. I can't com
plain about that."
"You still claim not to be able to
say why you committed these mur
ders?"
"I had no reason." Belew broke
down and sobbed uncontrollably. He
made no effort to check himself and the
spasm passed.
"Would you sign all these state
ments?"
"I've signed a statement that covers
everything. There's no use in signing
again. I'm guilty of the murders. I've
signed that."
The point was not pressed.
"Do you wish to add anything
more?" he was asked.
"I am willing to tell all, but I'm
tired. I haven't slept. I think I have
told it all. I've tried to. If I can
think of anything more I'll tell that,
too. I've nothing to hold back now.
It's no use. I will be glad to see you
to-morrow "
"Don't you feel relieved since you are
rid of this secret?"
"I do; you told me I would."
The man had partly risen from his
couch, and he sank back again, but
along the lonely conidor his broken
sobs echoed until drowned in the clat
ter of the iron door.
District Attorney Devlin, who had
worked hard on the case, felt a thrill
of professional delight upon learning
the result of the interview. He had
not been over sanguine about it, but
realizes now that his anxiety is over.
The man forfeit to the law has surren
dered to the relentless clutch in which
it held him. He can struggle no more.
Sheriff Rush is equally elated, and Un
der Sheriff Robinson feels that his la
bors have been rewarded.
Robinson was the man who on the
ranch placed handcuffs about the wrists
of Belew, and yet from that moment the
prisoner has regarded him as a friend.
The specific causes of the confession
are not hard to name.' The man was
fairly bursting with a sense of guilt,
and yet the fear of the gallows haunted
him. While he thought that he had
friends, that his brothers intended to
aid him, that a lawyer would hurry to'
his rescue, he withstood the impulse to
throw aside the sorry- sham of inno
cence. But, left to his conscience, his
memory, and hearing/ only the voice of
stran-gers, his fortitude forsook him.
To-night he has company. Near him
sits James T. Well?, a man who for
twenty years ha; ha a trusted Deputy
Sheriff. Well' â¢ guard him from
suicide. If B â /,- ..... 1 kill himself he
would; of this, tnft-e is no reasonable
doubt, and Sheriff Rush will see that he
is denied the opportunity.
The prisoner's statements as to par
ticulars are not all credible. For in
stance, his explanation of having had
the poison for years and then used it
without knowing why. He has unbur
dened himself to several people to
night, and nobody can begrudge this
poor boon, but to each he tried to give
the impression that the statement
then being made was the sole one ob
tained or obtainable.
HENRY JAMES.
READY TO CONFESS
AS THE NIGHT CAME.
Belew Cast Down by the Gloom of
the Day and the Desertion of
His Friends.
SUISUN, Feb. s.â This has been a
dreary day in Fairfield and Suisun.
The clouds hung to the ground, and at
times dissolved into a penetrating rain
THE SHERIFF NOTIFIED.
SUISUN, Feb. r.. â I have just been notified by the representatives
of The Call and Chronicle that they have secured Frank Belew's con
fession of the murder of his brother and sister, taken in the presence
of Under Sheriff T. L. Robinson, and have read the statements they
produce signed by the murderer.
This is the first notification I have had of a confession, and I am
heartily glad that it has been obtained.
The work of The Call and Chronicle in obtaining this statement
will materially assist the prosecution in the case. â 
B. F. RUSH. Sheriff.
against which an umbrella was scant
protection 1 . But the gloomiest spot in
Solano County was the Jail, and in the
darkest cell of that desolate structure
sat Frank Belew, sullen and silent,
silent because there was no one with
whom to converse even in his ordinary
monosyllables. His friends have de
serted him and the truth has been
borne in crushingly upon him. His
brother Tom has gone, leaving no word
except an expression of sorrowful
doubt as to the prisoner's innocence.
No lawyer has seen him, and a rumor
is abroad that legal acumen is waiting
for some visible token of a retainer.
Thus the prisoner felt alone, forsaken,
his guilt his only companion. Since his
incarceration Friday morning not a
mouthful of food has passed Belew's
lips. The plate that is handed through
the door to him three times daily is
returned without a crumb disturbed.
He has been offered stimulants and re
fused.
On the way down from the place of.
arrest he had begged for whisky, but
after the key had turned behind him
he knew that he needed a clear head,
and he knew that fuddled by whisky
he would easily be induced to give ut
terance to the confession he longed yet
did not dare to make.
The first sign of a breakdown came
when he realized that a belief in his
guilt was general and profound. He
had calculated upon financial backing
which is not forthcoming.
Confinement is becoming more and
more irksome. If he had a chance, the
prisoner would kill himself. He is not
troubled by remorse, but suffers in an
agony of fear. His impulse towards
confession arises partly from a theory
FRANK BELEW IN HIS CELL.
that it would incite a Judge to clem
ency. He has not the quality of cour
age. He lies on a cot now with his
face flushed. He has come so near col
lapse that he totters when he tries to
Btand. A stubby growth of beard
makes him look unprepossessing. To
day he wanted a razor, but the officers
thought it was for his throat instead
of his beard and refused the request.
To-day he tried to secure some mor
phine, but the trusties to whom he ap
pealed told the jailer and a closer
watch than ever was placed over him.
There is some thought of stationing
a watchman so the prisoner shall be
under constant surveillance.
It was in this cell that about fifteen
years ago a murderer named Keith
committed suicide on the day before
the_one set for his official hanging,
but it is not the ghost of Keith which
ALL SOLANO COUNTY SMILES.
DIXON, Cal.. Feb. s.â The Examiner's false statement that it
was the first paper to have a reporter here after the Belew mur
der is laughed at by everybody in Dixon. The register at the Ar
cade Hotel shows that Leigh H. Irvine, of The Call staff, registered
here at 10 o'clock on the night of November 9, while Edward
Moran, of the Examiner, arrived at the Palace thirty-six hours later.
John F. Connors arrived forty-eight hours after Irvine.
The Examiner withdrew its representaive from the field about
November 20, while The Call kept Irvine on the ground studying
the case until December 1.
The first newspaper account filed here by any special corre
spondent was that sent by Leigh H. Irvine at 11 o'clock on the
night of November 9. It ran as follows:
"My private tip to you is that the Belews were murdered by their
brother Frank. Full story coming."
Twenty-four hours later Moran filed for the Examiner a rehash
of what The Call had printed the day before.
The Call published from day to day exclusive news. It gave the
first account of the finding of poison in the food, of the analysis of
the food made at the high school, and of other features of the case,
crowning its efforts with the exclusive story of Frank Belew's ar
rest.
makes Belew desperate. If there are
ghosts disturbing him there they must
be those of Susie and Lewis Belew, the
brother and sister whom he so cruelly
slew.
At one stage Belew might have been
characterized as a stoic, but that stage
has passed. At every mention of the
murdered pair he cringes, and sighs
that are almost sobs shake his frame.
An effort was made during the after
noon to got him to make a definite
statement.
"Frank." said his visitor. "I am
sorry to have to believe you guilty. I
want you to tell the truth now; it can
not hart you and it may have the effect
of cif ating sympathy for you." So the
plea went on trying to reach some ten
der spot in the man's memory.
At first he made no sound except
one impossible to describe. It was the
suction as he gulped, vainly striving to
control his convulsive lips and the
throat which would vibrate. Then he
asked if his friends, his brothers, his
lawyers had been heard from. It was
hard to tell him that in his extremity
he was friendless; that his brothers,
convinced of his blood guiltiness, had
cast him off; that his lawyers had sent
no word. The man writhed. on his pile
of blankets, his right hand fumbling
the leaves of a magazine he had been
vainly trying to read.
"Frank," continued the visitor,
"think of the future; think how your
mind would be relieved if you would
tell the truth."
There was no response. The maga
zine leaves were more fiercely crum
pled. The flickering ray of the single
candle standing on the floor revealed
SIGNED STATEMENTS NOT SIGNED.
SUISUN, Feb. s.â Everybody here is laughing at the Examiner's
"signed statements," which, for the most part, were not signed.
The method of getting them was to ask a man questions, answer
them as seemed to yellow journalism to be fitting, and then forward
them as signed statements. Sheriff Rush was amused.
"I knew those fellows would put something in my mouth," he
said, "but it doesn't make any real difference. I did not make the
statement printed in the Examiner, and I did not sign anything for
that paper."
1 Another entertaining topic is the frantic endeavor of the Exam
iner to show that it knew all about the Belew business anyway,
even if it did not think to print it.
a flush in the cheek of the prostrate
man.
"So I have no friends?" He asked \
the question in the low monotone which
seems habitual now. "It's hard." With
this his lips closed and he was silent,

but his air of defiance had vanished.
Even physically the strong man has
become weak. Yesterday he would
deny the crime. To-day he would be
questioned and make no response.
Once he said: "What is the use of tell
ing you. You would not believe me."
Then the thought of Bird flashed
across his mind and he showed a mo
mentary animation. "I want you to
tell the world," he said, "that for four
years I supported Bird; that he used
my horse without charge, and lived off
me when I could not afford to keep
him."
"Why did you tell Bird what you had
done?"
"He pumped me."
Here was this guilty man, groping
near to the line of confession. He un
derstood in an instant what he had
done, and while he was keen enough
to check himself hg did not seem to re
gret it. If from the outer world there
had come then a relative to sustain
him, a friend on whom he might lean,
he would have unbosomed himself of
every detail of his dread secret. He
wanted to cry out "I am guilty! guilty!
Have mercy upon me!" yet this cry
would have been to man, the instrument
of punishment, not to the Giver of Life,
who tries men's souls. All about him
were strangers, who sought to know
the truth, not that they might con
sole, but that they might spread it to
the world, and apply as adequate a
penalty as the law provides.
Yet he did send out for one man. "I

would talk to him," he said. "I will j
not talk to people I don't know."
So for the time he was left to his '
thoughts, to the magazine he could no-t i
read, and to the shadows cast by the
cs.ndle. During the visit he did not at-
K-mpt to rise. The only comfortable {
s.tace in the cell was that his bundle,
Â«f blankets occupies. Water kept seep-
Ing from the corridor under the iron j
door, and collected in pools on the floor ,
which, even when the sun is shining, is
always damp, and sends a chill through
any one who may step on it, and at this j
time rain was pouring.
BELEW, THE PRISONER,
WAS ALSO A THIEF.
Even the Accused Man's Relatives
Have Been Forced to the Conclu- j
sion That He Is Guilty. ;
DIXON, Feb. s.â There are no longer
any friends of Frank Belew in this part
of the country. His last advocate has
abandoned the defense, while Tommy
and Arthur Belew no longer openly de
fend their incarcerated brother. Tommy
believes in his guilt.
John Martin, Frank Belew's father- j
in-law, was in town to-day. He has no j
doubt of Frank's guilt, and now talks
more freely than he did at the outset
of the case.
"Frank robbed me of $400 that I had
left with him a long time ago," he said,
"pretending that he had been robbed
himself. He soon appeared on the scene i
with a good deal more money than
usual and bought some presents for his
wife. When asked where he got the
money he said that he had won it at
cards, but there was never any doubt |
In my mind that he was the man who â¢
robbed me. His wife knew and has told
how he stole a neighbor's white hog,
buried its head, and burnt 1 the skin,
too, so as to avoid detection,"
Mr. Martin is a kind and generous old
gentleman of easy manner and gentle
voice. He is regarded as a truthful
man. All who have had dealings with
him say he would never make an 1 asser
tion without pretty good evidence of its ,
truth.
It is now recalled that Susie Belew '
called upon Notary Rice of the Dixon
Bank a few days before she was poi-
Boned and made known the fact that
she did not want Frank to get any of
her money. She was thinking of mak
ing a will in such a way as to prevent
the possibility of Frank getting it. She
thought he would spend his money, and
she knew that he had always been a
financial burden to the family.
To Banker Stephen Little, who took
a drive with him some weeks before
the murder, Frank Belew made serious |
complaint that he had not been prop- j
erly treated in the division of the Be- :
lew estate.
"His manner was that of one deeply
hurt," said Mr. Little, "and he seemed !
to brood over the matter, and fre
quently referred to it. He did not like
the idea of seeing Susie and Louis '
prosperous while he was forever at the
door of want. He made no threats in
my presence, but his manner was that
of one morose and discouraged."
There are many people who know
Frank Belew was not satisfied with the
way the estate was managed, and that
he apparently never forgave his par
ents for leaving him the small end of
their wealth, which amounted to about
510,000. It is now believed some of those '
who knew Frank Belew more intimate
ly will come forward and testify that I
they heard him make frequent com
plaint about his portion at the feast of
life.
The manner that characterized the
murderer at the funeral and afterward
at the Coroner's inquest give a fair in
dex of his character. He went to the
funeral with the young lady who had
expected to marry the poisoned broth
er, wore a long black coat and moved
softly among the mourners, speaking
in low tones, simulating the manner of I
one whose heart was broken. At the
inquest he told without a tremor how
he held his dying sister's hands while
she pleaded for relief from the pain :
of the arsenic he had fed her. and how
he saw her friends .feed her the poison
to the last. Soon after the crime he
circulated a story to the effect that he
had good evidence Harry Allen, who
had once been in love with Susie, com- j
mitted. the deed and killed Louis also
to get revenge for the dead brother's ,
interference in their love affair. Harry ;
Allen met Frank Belew afterward and
accused him of murdering his rela
tives.
"Be a man and confess that you poi
soned them both," said Allen as he
shook his finger at the trembling Be
lew.
Frank Belevr's manner then was like
that which characterizes him now.
When cornered he quails in spite of his
heavy jaws and sinewy frame.
"If you did not murder them and
try to make the world believe I did it."
added Allen, "why don't you stand up
jbere and fight like a man?"
Belew turned pale and trembled, pro
testing his innocence, but offering no
more resistance than a rabbit.
"You will probably be hanged on the
evidence against you, whether you are
guilty or innocent," said a reporter to
Belew in the Suisun jail. "How do you
think you will stand the ordeal of
stepping on the scaffold?" The man
trembled. He looked like one from
â whose life all hope had vanished. He
did not rise up in the majesty of strong
manhood and say he would die an in
nocent man. He looked downcast, his
eyes wandered aimlessly, while he
swallowed convulsively like one in
mortal anguish.
It was the same manner that marked
the strange scene between the mur
derer and Harry Allen last November,
when the accused lover of the dead
girl, conscious of his innocence, stood
like a tower of strength and denounced
the man whose manner he then de
clared branded him with the mark of
Cain.
Orasco Given His Freedom.
PASADENA, Feb. s.â Juan Orasco, the
Mexican charged with" the murder of his
17-year-old wife, was freed to-day. . Mrs.
Orasco was , found dead in her room on
January "IS. ' , The Coroner's verdict was

Defeat "
His Opponent Misses When In
Need of but Four
Points.
Remarkable Playing of the Billiarclists
at thÂ« Wide Balkline
Game.
Special Dlspntch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Feb. s.â With the vic
tory of the American championship at
18-inch balk line billiards almost with
in his grasp George Slosson was de
feated to-night by Juke Schaefer of
Chicago by a score of 600 points to 596
points in the game for the champion
ship of America, in Madison Square
Garden Concert Hall.
Throughout the game the men
were playing so evenly that it was
a toss-up as to who would win.
Schaefer was the favorite, but toward
the end of the game it seemed that
Slosson would win. He fell down on a
drive to the cushion when he had a
good lead and only four points to score
to win. On the whole the billiards were
very slow, but the play was inter
spersed with some brilliant work,
which kept the spectators on edge dur
ing the course of the game.
Nearly every billiard enthusiast of
note in this city and vicinity was at
Madison Square Garden Concert Hall
to-night to witness the contest. The
intricacies of the 18-inch balk line
game were never made more apparent
than in to-night's contest. Each man
was on his mettle, but the slowness of
the scoring, made it evident that the
18-inch balk line game, with its condi
tion of one shot in space, is calculated
to puzzle the most expert players.
"The Wizard" opened with a mise
and Slosson followed suit. Then Schaf
and Slosson followed suit. Then Shaef
opponent responded with a similar
combination. Siosson.in his third In
ning by clever all-round playing placed
2S to his credit, and Schaefer in his sixth
and Beventh innings responded with xi
and 23, most of which were made in the
open by very dextrous playing.
Schaefer in his eleventh inning put up
a beautiful bunch of 24, to which Slos
son replied with good runs of 19 and 20.
Schaefer then get the balls under his
control and played faultlessly for 24
buttons and followed up with a string
of 14 and 56.
At the end of the fiftieth inning tho
score stood: Schaefer, 340: Slosson, 324.
The score at the end of itfe sixty
eighth stood: Slosson, 466; Schaefer,
452.
Slosson played second fiddle in the
music made by th<* click of the ivories
until the finish of the fifty-fourth in
ning, when he passed the Chicago man
with a spurt of 23 buttons. From this
time on Slosson kept in the lead, and
by some very pretty work on the open
table he put together a beautifully
bunched lfi.
At the conclusion of the seventy-sixth
inning. Schaefer was 65 points behind,
but by brilliant all-around playing,
which included delicate nursing and
wonderfully straight billiards, the
Western player soon tied the score,
amidst deafening cheers and handclap
ping. Some of the shots were marvel
ously executed, and the most difficult
problem offered him seemed easy untl
he fell down on a "follow shot" to tho
cushion, when he had made a break
of 76, which put him 11 points ahead of
his adversary.
With thirty-eight to get in order to
win. SlOBSon started on a beautiful run
in the eightieth inning. The New
Yorker made 34 by clever work, but
he fell down on a. draw shot which was
very difficult. Schaefer then started in
and ran out the game, with the well
put 24, which was played in faultless
style. The score:
Schaefor. 600; average. 7 11-27.
Slosson, EM; average. 7 0-20.

SANTA ANA VOTES FOR
A NEW SEWER SYSTEM.
Proposition to Bond the Town Car
ries by an Overwhelming Ma
jority.
SANTA ANA, Feb. s.â The election on
| the proposition of voting $60,000 for a sew
er system in this city to-day brought out
the largest vote in the history of the
| town on any similar proposition. The to
! tal vote cast was 910, of. which only ten
were thrown out by errors. Bonds were
] carried by a decisive vote of 624 to 276,
! and there is general rejoicing in the town
; over the result.
| The plans upon which bonds were voted
are for a system of twenty railes of sew-
I ers, reaching over half the territory of
j the city and emptying into the Santa Ana
I River bed two miles west of town. It is
I claimed the sewage from the city will be
disposed of with profit to the city to vege
! table gardeners cultivating sandy soil
! along the outfall. The opposition to bonds
i was based on the contention that the
i town did not need so large a system, and
! that the plan of bonding the town to con
struct sewers akmg private residence
property was unfair to the property own
! erg who will not be reached by the sys
â  tern.
The city officials state that the work of
: selling the bonds and proceeding with the
: construction of the system will be pushed
â â  as rapidly as possible. The plan adopted
by the voters of Santa Ana to-day will
give the city the largest sewer system of
' any place of Its size in the State.

Workman Employed on the Salinas
Sugar Factory Receives a
Bad Fall.
SALINAS, Feb. 5.â L. R. Rock, an em
1 ploye of the Risdon Iron Works, engaged
;at the sugar factory, was seriously in
j jured just before noon to-day. While
' at work on the superstructure of the third
I floor he stepped backward off the large
steel floor joist, and would no doubt have
been instantly killed had it not been for
his r-xm-mft presence of mind. Just as
1 the man was falling he grabbed a rope
: which was used for hoisting timber, and
held on to it as best he rould. at the
same time sliding down toward the floor
below.
Tlie friction, however, made it Impos
sible for the unfortunate man to hold on.
After he had descended one story he let
: go and fell two stories to the bottom of
the building. He was picked up in a
' critical condition. There was an ugly
und deep cut just over the left eye and
exposing the eyeball, the eyelid being al
most severed. The left leg was badly
â  lacerated, one cut being about five inches
long and very deep. The hands, fore
arms and legs were badly rope-burned.
Eight stitches were required on the face
and six on the leg.

CAUGHT WHEN
ALMOST BLIND
Washington's Wild Man
Taken After a Long
Quest.
Was for Months a Terror to
Defenseless Women and
Children.
Misfortunes of William Russell, Who
Spent Years in a Search for
a Lost Mine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Feb. s.â Deputy Sheriff
Lane made an important capture to
day in apprehending William Russell,
a wild man 7 years of age. For six
months past Russell has been frighten
ing wives and children in various parts
of King County, almost in a miracu
lous manner eluding the vigilance of
officers of the law. He has been driven
from one part of the country to
another, hunted by Deputy Sheriffs,
chased by dogs, and pursued by farm
ers armed with guns. For eight months
he has had practically nothing to eat
but carrots, cooked in a stew, and it is
probable that during this time he has
not had a single bath. Lane captured
him in the woods near the little town
of Dcs Moines in a hole dug in the
ground, where he made his home. Rus
sell is slowly but surely growing blina,
and he said that when the white
growth had covered both eyes he in
tended to kill himself.
Eight months ago Russell reached
Seattle after a long tramp from Brit
ish Columbia, where he went two years
before to dig for gold. His quest has
not been successful, and all that he
had been able to save after twenty
three years of hard work in the woods
of Washington and Oregon was ex
pended in the attempt to find a claim
that he had. He was so long getting
back and had such hard luck that when
he reached Seattle his clothes were
barely ht-ld together. He had no money
and no one would give him work. He
was too proud to beg. For twenty
years he had been slowly growing
blind. He thought of suicide, but could
not bring himself to take his own life.
Then he decided to go back into the
woods in which he had worked so long.
He did so, but to die, not work.
The Sheriff's office first heard of Rus
sell from farmers living near Black
River Junction, who reported that a
wild man was running around through
the woods, frightening their wives and
children. They said that he carried a
gun and was likely to shoot somebody.
They described him as having a face
covered with hair and said he had only
one eye, which shot out evil glances
at any one who came near him.
After a long search Russell was final
ly located in his burrow. He was with
out hat or shoes, while the coat he
wore hung in shreds from shoulders
that had once been broad and strong.
His trousers were ragged and seemed
to be his only covering. His long hair
and heavy beard almost covered his
face, which was black from the accu
mulation of dirt, iii^jiinger nails had
not been cut for. n 'rmii and were as
sharp as knives.
Russell was induced to come forth,
and, as he talked rationally on all sub
jects, he had no trouble satisfying the
Sheriff as to his sanity. Lan- finally
persuaded him to come to the city.
When the County Jail was reached he
was taken into the hospital ward and
placed in the bath tub. At meal time
he asked for carrots. The regular prison
meal he did not seem to fancy. At
first the authorities intended putting a
charge of vagrancy against Russell,
but finally th>- County Commissioners
decided to semi him to the Poor House.
HORRIBLE DEATH
OF TWO MINERS
Mangled by the Premature
Discharge of a Blast at
Bisbee.
Special Dlspatrh to The Call.
BISBEE, Feb. 6.â Two young and well
known miners, E. C. Clark and W. S.
Young, both single, while working in the
mine here last evening, were horribly
mangled by the premature discharge of a ;
blast. Both filed, Clark almost instant- ,
ly. while Young lived until 12 o'clock last
night.
The mm had loaded the holes and light
ed the. fuses. Tho first on.- wns lighted,
but the second refused to burn, it be
ing very wet in the face of the drift.
While they were trying to make the sec
ond fuse burn the first one was discharg
ed, throwing the rocks with terrific force
against the unfortunate miners. Before |
they could get out the second blast ex
ploded. Clark was killed almost instant- j
ly, while Young, with a leg broken, one
eye gone and his whole side pierced by
sharp rocks, managed to crawl eighty or
a hundred reet out of the tunnel, where
he lay calling for help. He was found
at about 7 o'clock by the shift foreman.
He managed to tell how the accident oc
curred, and that was all.

Signed Manifesto From â  the
First Presidency of the
Church.

Politicians Believe That It Moans Pre
ferment in His Political
'.' . Aspirations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OGDEN, Feb. 5.â A sensation in re
ligious and political circles was occa
sioned this afternoon by the appear
ance in the colu: ins of the Deseret
News, the organ of the Mormon
curch, of a manifesto signed by the
first presidency of that church, which
la an extended history of the labors of
Colonel Isaac Trumbo of Salt Lake,
now in San Francisco, in behalf of the
: political and religious freedom of the
people of Utah. To him is given the
' credit for procuring amnesty for the
; Mormon people after the enforcement
\ of the Edmunds-Tucker act by the Fed
! eral Government, and, above all, the
j obtaining of Statehood for Utah. The
; acknowledged burden of gratitude and
thankfulness is so pronounced that the
public has accepted the manifesto to
mean nothing short of a willingness to
bestow upon Colonel Trumbo an exalt
j ment somewhat commensurate with the
â  good he has done this people, and,
1 therefore, astute politicians see in this
; latest move of the Mormon church the
; foreshadowing of important political
; events, it having been common rumor
for more than two years past that
Colonel Trumbo, in his political aspira
tions, would yet be recognized as a
church candidate. The concluding
words of the new manifesto are as fol
lows:
We felt thankful many times for the
kind Providence which raised him up,
for he seemed to come to our aid at a
time when a man in his position and with
his indefatigable energy was especially
needed; when the Mormon people were
threatened with disfranchisement Colonel
Trumbo spent considerable time in Wash
ington, exerting himself to the utmost of
his ability to defeat that infamous meas
ure, and while there were othor agencies
also at work, still Colonel Isaac Trumbo
was the means of bringing powerful inllu
ences to bear against the enactment of
that villainous bill. In the defeat of that
proposed legislation every member of our
church had cause to be deeply grateful to
the Lord and to the instrument which un
der him was the means of bringing it to
naught.
With the same zeal and devotedness he
worked untiringly to obtain the amnesty*
and also afterward in securing the return
of the personal property of the church
and in preparing the way for the return
of the real estate.
Colonel Trumbo was most fortunate in
winning the respect and admiration ol i
influential men in the nation. By his rep
resentations of the condition of things ;n
the then Territory of Utah and his en
thusiastic defense of the Mormon people
he aroused the active interest and sym
pathies of very many of them. This was
notably the case with General James fc>.
Clarkson. This gentleman was deeply
moved by all that he learned, and he en
tered with his whole soul and great in
fluence with Colonel Trumbo into the tf
fort to make the true character olihc, .
people known to the nation and to re
move the widespread and deop-rooted
prejudices which existed so generally at :
that time against the Mormon people. It
would be invidious, perhaps, to attempt
to give names of other loading and in
fluential public men who. by the powerful
appeals which were made to them, were
induced to examine what was known as
the Mormon question from a different
standpoint to that which they had occu
pied; but their names are cherished in
grateful remembrance by the men of
Utah and their deeds will be preserved
In the history of the people.
All the influence which he had gained by
personal acquaintance Colonel Trumbo
used to make the people of Utah better
known to the nation at large and toward
pn-iiarinir the way for the admission of
Utah as a State. It is not necessary for
us to go into details concerning his labors \
in this direction; it is sufficient to say |
that probably no single agency contri
buted so much to making Utah a State
as the labors of Colonel Isaac Trumbo and
his immediate friends.
(Signed)
WII-FORD WOODRUFF,
GEORGE Q. CANNON,
wOSEPH F. SMITH.
When seen in this city last night,
Trumbo said that he knew nothing con
cerning the manifesto of the first pres
idency of the Mormon Church. His
only information was that contained in
telegrams from newspapers. The man
ifesto, he says, comes as a surprise to
him.
PROMOTION FOR
CAPTAIN CONWAY
The Columbia's Captain Named
as Successor to E. J.
Rathbone.
In Charge of the Oregon Railway and
Company's
Water Lines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. s.â Captain
George Conway of the steamer Columbia
has been appointed by President Mohler
of the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company to succeed E. J. Rathbone, re
signed, as superintendent of the water
lines of that company. Captain Conway
will make his headquarters in Portland
and will have full charge of all the Ore
gon Railway and Navigation Company's
steamboat business and of the California
steamers in so far as they are controlled
by the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company. Captain Conway is the best
known of the present generation of steam
ship men on the coast and has been con
nected since boyhood with various kinds
of deep water craft. His appointment is
considered an excellent one and will give
general satisfaction.
Captain Ccn-.vay entered the service on
this coast fifteen years ago. He was for
a long time first officer of the Pacific
Ccast Steamship Company's vessels, and
left them to take charge of the steamship
Point Loma. remaining with her until she
was wrecked on Long Beach three years
ago. His skill and judgment at that time
were undoubtedly the means of saving
many lives. He was appointed master of
the Columbia, to succeed Captain Bolles,
and his career with that steamer has
been highly successful.
Captain Rathbone, whom he succeeds,
grew up in the Oregon Railway and Nav
igation Company"? service and his resig
nation was unexpected. He will go to the
Yukon, where he hopes to make more
money than in the employ of the com
pany.

SANTA ROSA, Feb. s.â Residents of
this city living in the neighborhood of
Fifth and Washington streets were star
tled late this evening- by the report of
two pistol shots coming from a dwell
ing. Hurrying to the scene, officers
found Mrs. Peterson, a well-known resi

pistol still In her hand. A large patch
of plastering had been torn from the wall A
by one bullet, and a window had been
broken by other.
Inc4Uiry developed the fact that just af
ter supper the back door of the Peter
son household had been opened by a
burly-looking stranger, who walked in
and proceeded to make himself at home.
Instead of obeying the orders of the mis
tress of the house and leaving at once, he
endeavored to become very familiar. Mrs.
Peterson stepped to a table, at one sido
of the room, picked up. a revolver ami
blazed away. Her aim was poor, and
she missed her mark, but the intruder
took a sudden dive through a side door
and disappeared in the 1 darkness. When
last seen he was going up Cherry street

JAPANESE NOT MONGOLIANS.
BERKELEY, Feb. 5. â The question to what race
the Japanese belong is not entirely settled. For my
part, although I do not pretend to be an expert 1 think
they are more closely allied to the Malay than to
any other race. Many regard them as allied to the
Mongols, as well as to the Malays, but 1 am inclined to
class them with the Malay rather than with the Mon
golian race.
JOSEPH LE CONTE,
Professor of Biology, University of California
over, are not disposed to be put in thf
position of laying down legal princi
ples. But, in substance, their conten
tion is that under the laws as they ex
Is to-day Japanese in the United Statei
are entitled to naturalization. The offi
cials freely admit that in some in
stances the Tnited States courts hav t
taken the ground that such applica
tions cannot be entertained, notably ii
the Boston case decided June 27, 1594
known as " In re Salto," but they also
assert that the practice of the courts
has not been by any means uniform ir
this matter and that theVe are very
many cases where Japanese have beer,
admitted to the rights of naturaliza
tion without the slightest objection on
the part of the court.
It is not denied that the State De
partment itself has not been consistent
in its treatment of the question, as is
made plain by reference to the existing
regulations for the government of the
diplomatic service, in which is to be
found a direction to the United States
officers abroad to refuse to recognize
the claims of Japanese to naturalized
citizens' rights. However, the regula
tion was founded upon the old statute,
section 2169. which was couched in
terms so vague as to give rise to the
varying constructions placed upon it
by the courts, and the latest view of
the department is, as stated, that the
Japanese may apply for naturalization.
The old statute seems to limit naturali
zation to white persons and persons of
African descent. It was plainly a piece
of patchwork, as history reveals, and
an exact application of the test of lan
guage to it would not, it is held, prove
the real purpose of its authors.
Aside from that, the broad question
fcas been raised that the Japanese are
not to be regarded as outside of white
races, they not being Mongolian in the
true ethnological sense.
It is probably sufficient for the pur
pose of this explanation of the depart
ment's position to cite these considera
tions as a matter that might readily
account for the failure of the courts to
reach unanimity in the construction of
this law. There has not been up t>.
this time, it is said, any expression of
opinion on the part of the court of last
resort, the United States Supreme
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1898.
Court, and untlj such opinion shall
have been called forth the question
â¢annot be regarded as settled. When
'uch opinion is rendered, of course, the
department of State will be bound by
t, and meanwhile it has no desire to
nose as a usurper of the rights of the
judicial branch of the Government.
As for the condition that will arise
jnder the new treaty with Japan that
r.-ps? Into effect in 1899 the department
holds that it confers upon the Japanese
â¢he rights of the favored nations in all
matters. While there does not as yet
any naturalization treaty be
tween Japan and the United States,
this cannot be regarded as a bar to
naturalization, for there are no such
treaties existing with a number of
countries the citizens of which are ad
mitted to United States citizenship In
compliance with the laws.
BECOMES THE
BARON'S BRIDE
Mi~s Alice Younger Weds
Baron De Devlin at
Vienna.
An Interesting Ceremony in the
Church of the English
Embassy.
Copyrighted 1398 by James Gordon Bennett.
VIENNA, Feb. s.â There was an un
wonted stir here among the American
colony here Tuesday morning when
Miss Alice Younger, daughter of Dr.
William J. Younger of San Francisco,
was married to Baron Laval Nugent de
Devlin, a first lieutenant in the Austro-
Hungarian Tenth Infantry. The cere
mony took place in the little church of
the I'.ritish embassy. The chancel and
altar were beautifully decorated with
palms and evergreens. Rev. W. H. Heck
lor, the chaplain, officiated. Previous
ceremony had been held in the morn
ing at the Evangelical Church In Doro
thengasse.
Dr. Younger being unable to cross
the ocean in order to be present at the
marriage, the bride was given away by
I'nited States Minister Charlemagne
Tower. The bride is a blonde, tall, and
looked very handsome in her dress of
white corded silk, trimmed with real
point lace. Her veil was of tulle and
she tarried a nosegay of white lilacs.
The groom was in uniform.
The only bridesmaid, Miss Florence
Younger, was dressed in pink silk,
trimmed with the same shade of mous
seline de soie.
The best man, Baron Bothner of
Budapest, was also in uniform.
The stepmother of the bride, Mrs.
Younger, looked well in a brown vel
vet, with turquoise trimmings and
small bonnet to match. Mrs. Tower
had on a most becoming walking dress.
The wedding breakfast was held at the
Grand Hotel. Among the guests pres
ent were Count and Countess Potocka,
General Yon Muller, Colonel Amelin,
Baron Brosch, lieutenant in the navy;
Captain Podhajsky, Mr. and Mrs. Yon
Hagen and Professor and Madame Le
schatitsky. The bridegroom is the son
of Baron Walter Nugent de rDelvin of
Budapest. The family is of remote
English descent.
FINIGAN MAY GO
TO JAIL AGAIN
His Wife's Attorneys Still
on the Colonel's
Trail.
Want Him Cited for Contempt Be
cause of His Failure to Pay
Alimony.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. s.â There Is more
trouble In store for Colonel Peter A. Fin
igan. For some time past the prospect
of again going to jail for contempt of
court has hung over Finigan's head, and
now it Is ready to descend. Mrs. Finigan
In an affidavit filed this afternoon alleges
that Colonel Finigan has paid no atten
tion whatever to Judge Angellotti's order
that he pay $300 to her for expenses of
suit, attorney's fees, etc., and $100 a
month as alimony.
Ex-Judge R. R. Bigelow on behalf of
Mrs. Finigan to-day petitioned Superior
Judge Ang'ellottl to set a day citing Flni
gan to appear in court and show cause
why he should not be found guilty of con
tempt for not complying with the court's
orders. When the Colonel is brought Into
court an interesting question will come
up. Finigan was once before found guilty
of contempt and sent to jail until he
should rt-spect "the orders of the court.
Finigan stayed in jail for six weeks and
! then filed a petition in Insolvency, went
before the court as a pauper and asserted
that he was too poor to pay alimony;
that he had no money, and was In fact
Insolvent. Judge Angellotti was com
pelled to release Finigan. The insolvency
proceedings are still before the court and
Flnigan has not been discharged as an In
solvent.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, Feb. s.â George W. Clark, the
se lf-confessed murderer of his brother,
William Anderson Clark, was brought
from his cell in the County Jail this
morning to Judge Ham's courtroom to
be formally charged with the crime of
which he is accused. The prisoner,
pale, trembling and with faltering step,
was led into the court by a posse of
stalwart deputy sheriffs, who were
obliged to force a way through the
morbid crowd that filled the room and
overflowed Into the corridors. The
prisoner was joined by his attorneys,
E. L. Webber, Henry Hogan and C. J.
Beerstecher as soon as he had been giv
en a seat at the attorneys' tables.
When order had been demanded the
defendant's counsel made a formal mo- J
tion, asking the court to set aside the
Information filed against their client
and for which he was to be arraigned,
on the ground that before the filing
of the information the defendant had
not been legally committee 1 by a magis
trate. In support of the motion the at
torneys said that the depositions laid
before the committing magistrate, upon
which the warrant of arrest was is
sued, did not state facts sufficient- Ur
constitute a public offense; that from
the deposition taken before the com
mitting magistrate on defendant's ex
amination there was not any reason or
probable cause to believe defendant
guilty of the offense charged in the in
formation; that the filing ut said infor
mation against defendant by the Dis
trict Attorney without any affidavits
of the commission of an offense was
unconstitutional, and that the filing of
said information against defendant by
the District Attorney was also uncon
stitutional.
Judge Ham jÃ^pUed that as far as the
points incorporated in the motion were
concerned they had all been decided by
the Supreme Court, notably in the
Durrant and Ebanks cases, and he
would deny the motion.
The attorneys for the defense as.ked
the court for more time to review the
evidence taken in the preliminary ex
amination and to prepare an argument
in support of the motion. By consent of
the Â£>istrict Attorney the request was
granted and it was agreed that Thurs
day next be set for the presentation of
the case to the court. On that day the
prisoner will plead, and it was agreed
that the case be set for trial on Febru
ary 21.
Clark has become a puzzling client
for his attorneys. When Beerstecher
and Hogan were engaged to defend
him their first advice to the prisoner
was to be cautious in his remarks and
to say nothing about his case to any
one. That was a few hours after he
had made a confession of his guilt.
Since then Clark has heeded well the
advice given him, and his attorneys
have been unable even to get him to
converse with them. E. L, Weboer, a
brilliant young man and a promising
attorney, was only a few hours before
the case was called to-day asked to as
sist in the defense. Clark had not taken
his lawyers into his confidence up to
the time Webber had agreed to help
to defend him, and when the prisoner
appeared in the courtroom the trio of
lawyers did not know whether their
client would plead Innocent or guilty
of the charge.
The motion that was presented was
prepared hurriedly and it gave the de
fendant's lawyers an opportunity to
ask for time to become better ac- I
quainted with the prisoner and agree I
with him on a line of defense.
Clark has since his imprisonment
tried every way possible to shield Mrs.
Clark, the widow of the brother he
confessed he killed, of any complicity
in the crime, while at the same time,
when asked direct questions of any al
leged actions on her part which would
make her equally guilty of the murder I
with him, he will neither affirm nor I
deny them.
The murderer is a peculiarly consti
tuted man. He is considered by those
who know him best as a weak minded
person, who could be easily led. Since
his arrest he has recoiled from telling
a lie with horror, saying that he would
be eternally damned if he should give
expression to an untruth: yet at the
same time he looks upon murder as
only a trivial omission.
Clark's attorneys to-day were elab
orating a line of defense and when the
case comes to trial in all probability
an effort will be made to show that the
man accused of the murder committed
the deed at the instigation of Mrs.
Clark. It will be shown by testimony
fhat the self-confessed murderer and
Mrs. Clark had several times agreed
to marry if only "William Clark, the
husband of the woman, were out of the
way.
An effort will be made to prove that
George Clark acted with the full cog
nizance of Mrs. Clark when he tAvice
attempted the murder of his brother
with poison, and also when on the
morning of January 20 he shot his un
fortunate relative at the doorway of his
home. An effort in this line of defense
will be made to prove that the simple
minded murderer simply carried out
the instructions of his brother's wife as
faithfully as he could and lured on by
the unnatural fascination the woman
had for him.

BOSTON, Feb. 6.â ln a letter which
was received this afternoon by a well
known Boston man from one of the of
ficers of the cruiser New York there
are received some startling facts about
a series of accidents which are said to
have befallen several of the warships
that form a part of the North Atlantic
squadron. The squadron under com
mand of Admiral Montgomery Sicard
is at present at Key West, where the
warships have been mostly occupied
with the practice of evolutions and
keeping- a lookout for Cuban filibus
ters.
The letter is dated at Key West, Jan
uary 28. The officer, after relating
some of his own experiences, describes
a certain day of accidents, all of which
have been kept quiet by the Navy De
partment and which have not been be
fore heard of outside of the officials of
the squadron. The letter says: "Yes
terday, Thursday, January 27, the ad
miral took the fleet out for drill. In
going out the Texas struck a rock and
sustained some damage, just what we
have not learned. Captain Phtllip, her
commander, and the navigating officer
were called over and there may be a
court of inquiry. Captain Phillip says
that the damage to the Texas won't
amount to much.
"On coming back from the drill In
the afternoon about 4:30 the lowa went
on a big rock in the center of the chan
nel. We (the New York) went back
and got five wire hawsers attached to
her. We then lit the fires under six
boilers and attached the four engines.
We got the Montgomery on ahead of
us and at midnight or about 1 o'clock
they started ahead at full speed. The
Montgomery snapped her winch short
off and broke down our sounding
bridge."
These are all the particulars which
are given of the accidents on that day,
and the officer doesn't say to what ex
tent the damages have been deter
i mined, as the letter was written imme
diately after reaching Key West after
: the disastrous afternoon at sea drill.
i He calls attention to the Indiana being
rendered useless and says: "The Indi
, ana is broken down. They had a tour
! of one day coming down here and now
! the boiler makers from all the ships
i are on board of her, retubing her boil
j ers."
Captain Phillip, who is spoken of as
being "called over" for the accident to
the Texas, was formerly connected
with the Charleston Navy Yard, and
was ordered to the command of the
Texas last September. The run of bad
: luck constantly seeming to follow the
' battleship on her cruises has been
laughed at by Captain Phillip, who has
' been regarded as one of the ablest offt
' clals in the navy, and in the four years
' in which he had the office of captain
! of the yard at the Charleston Navy
Yard he was regarded as one of the
most competent officials who had ever
served here.

NEW YORK, Feb. 5.â A Wash
ington special to the Herald
saya: There is a possibility that
the United States will Inaugu
rate retaliatory measures upon
Canada for the harsh action
taken by the Dominion Govern
ment in several American ques
tions.
Measures prohibiting the em
ployment of aliens upon public
works and designed to injure the
American lumber industry have
recently been adopted by the
Toronto legislature. A strong
protest has been called out from
the "Washington Government,
however, by the imposition of a
heavy fine upon A. D. Malloch
of Boston, master of the Ameri
can fishing schooner Carrie E.
Phillips, for a technical violation
of the Canadian navigation laws.
The vessel was seized and de
tained five days and its master
was compelled to forfeit $150. It
was estimated that the owners
and crew lost $1500 as a result
of the detention and the spoiling
of the bait on board the ship.
Representative Simpkins has
brought the matter to the at-
tention of the House, and he de
clares that if the wrong is not
righted he will introduce a reso
lution asking the President of
the United States to direct the
Treasury Department to enforce
to the extreme penalty the regu
lations of our own ports.
Mr. Simpkins called attention
to-day to the case of the British
steamer Danube, which last sum
mer violated the navigation laws
of the United States at Skaguay,
Alaska. He said she was clearly
entitled to forfeiture, but Em
baseador Pauncefote repre
sented to the Government that
only a nominal line should be jm
posed. He will endeavor to use
the Danube to gain his point in
the Malloch case.
SEATTLE, Feb. 5.â L. C. Branson, a '
Post-Intelligencer Syndicate corre- |
spondent, writing from Fort "Wrangel,
under date of January 29, confirms the I
reported news that Canada has entered
territory which the United States has i
always claimed as its own, has taken j
full possession and will attempt to !
compel Americans not only to pay duty
before passing over, but will not permit ,
them, as the United States has done, \
to take up land without payment to '
the government of large sums of i
money. Mr. Branson's letter is as fol
lows :
"The Dominion of Canada, through
the agent of the provincial government :
of British Columbia, in one short week !
â will have taken formal possession of |
the country about Lake Bennett, on
the Yukon trail of Dyea and Skaguay. !
Zealous Americans residing in Alaska
have ever contended that the upper or >
south point of Lake Bennett and all !
of Lake Llndeman are within the i
Alaskan boundary."
Only the last mail from Skaguay !
brought the news that Willis Thorpe, j
the Alaskan cattleman, had resisted
the collection of Canadian duties at
Lake Bennett upon the ground that it
was American territory. The theory of
Thorpe and others is that the boundary
line at thirty miles from the coast, to
be computed from the actual shore line
of the mainland rather than the outer !
rim of the islands, would place him still
under the stars and stripes."
But so far as the formality of posses
sion goes the British are first on the i
ground, for a passenger of the Canad- ;
ian Pacific steamer Tees, lying here j
to-day, is Captain W. J. Rant, British j
Columbian gold commissioner, stipend- !
ary magistrate and revenue collector, I
with headquarters at the south end of \
Lake Bennett. Captain Rant will deal !
out the law as a sort of . government
agent. The mounted police -of the
neighboring province of Northwest I
Territory will be subservient to his
orders when required. He will issue ]
all licenses and collect the fees, and, !
as he put it, will be "Pooh-Bah. of the
district." Every Yukon-bound traveler â¢
must contribute either directly or in- |
directly to the provincial government '
through Captain Rant. No man shall !
cut a tree to build his boat without
first procuring a hand-logger license, i
which scrap of paper costs $10. â¢'__â¦
Hundreds if Americans who have at
tempted to cross the disputed territory
are indignant at what they consider the
outrageous and hi:;h-hanrle<l proceed- !
ings of the Canadian officials, and ex
pect to seethe matter taken up imme
diately for adjustment by .the United
States. Many prospectors have refused '
to pay duty and have returned to Dyea. !
The timber of Lake Bennett has boon !
granted to private parties under a
lease. The wholesale cutting of trees
for sawmills- will be stopped at once, or j
a round stumpage charge exacted. '
Captain Rant has so notified Markus &
Randolph, who operated a sawmill at
the southwestern arm of the lake last j
season. When the lumber is cut by
hand one or more boa ts. may be built i
by. the same Individuals on a single llâ J*
cense. This restriction does not end :
with Lake Bennett, but boat builders j
after crossing the Northwest Territory !
line must deal with the officers at Lake j
Tagjsh.
â¢ "This is not a new law," said Captain j
ALASKA RELIEF
EXPEDITION SETS
SAIL FOR DYEA
Troops and Supplies Start From
Portland on the George
W. Elder.
PORTLAND, Feb. s.â The expedition which the United States Gov
ernment Is pending Into the Interior of Alaska with supplies for the
relief of miners who are reported to be In want sailed for Dyea to
nlpht on the steamship George W. Elder. The Elder carried 350 passen
gers, fifty-one of whom are officers and enlisted men of the army,
who will act as escort to the pack train, which, it is expected, will car
ry the relief supplies over the passes.
The officers in charge of the detachment sailing on the Elder are:
Captain George Ruhlen, assistant quartermaster; Captain Bopardus
Eldrldge, In charge of the escort, with Lieutenant E. W. Clark, assist
ant, and Lieutenant G. M. Kemp, asistant surgeon.
About 200 tons of provisions were sent forward by the Government
from here, and an additional supply will go from Seattle In a few
days.
Brigadier General Merriam, commanding the Department of the Co
lumbia, who has had general supervision erf the prsparations for the
expedition, has assigned Major L. H. Rucker, Fourth Cavalry, to the
command of the relief expedition. Major Rucker has been in Alaska
for several weeks, and has taken temporary station at Dyea, where he
has established a camp and supply depot. General Merriam expects
to go to Alaska on the steamer Oregon, which is scheduled to sail frcrm
here on February 8, and from Dyea he will direct affairs until the ex
pedition is started over the pass. Captain L. D. Brainard, commissary
of subsistence, and disbursing officer for relief supplies, will also go
forward by the Oregon.
The Government has let a contract to the Snow and Ice Transpor
tation Company of Chicago for carrying 150 tons of supplies from Dyea
to Dawson, but as the paraphernalia of the company have not yet ar
rived on the Pacific Coast, it is possible that General Merriam will
send on a portion of the supplies by pack train to Lake Le Barge and
there build boats on which to carry the supplies dcnvn the Yukon.
It is expected that the 500 reindeer brought from Norway by the
Government will be landed in Alaska within a month, and, If possible,
additional supplies will be taken in with them.
Rant, to-day. "It is to be enforced up
there for the first time. It is no more
than right, for if you build a boat in
Seattle you must pay for the lumber."
Captain Rant has had many years
in the service of the Crown. For six
teen j-ears in India and four In Zulu
land he served in Queen Victoria's cav
alry, retiring with the rank of Captain,
which rank he retains under the laws
after a score of years in the saddle.
Last fall he was in the special service
of the provincial police as a private,
and is well remembered at Skaguay
and Lake Bennett. He has every trait
of a gentleman, up to that of being the
same under all conditions of rank. Cap
tain Rant is accompanied by his son,
who is in charge of two dog teams.
WASHINGTON OFFICIALS
RECEIVED NO NOTICE.
Not Yet Cognizant of the Seizure of
Lake Bennett- Territory by
Canada.
"WASHINGTON*. Feb. s.â The officials
of this Government are watching with
some interest the attempts of the Brit
ish Columbian publications to make it
appear that valuable territory In
Southeastern Alaska is within the Brit
ish possessions. The semi-official map
put out in the British Columbian year
book Is but oce Instance of British
trickery to make it appear that such
important points as Juneau, Dyea and
Skaguay are within her Majesty's ter
ritory.
A publication still more dangerous
than the year book has been issued. It
is an official map published by the
Surveyor-General in the Interior De
partment at Ottawa, This map has just
been received at the coast and geodetic
survey here, and has excited some com
ment. It marks no boundary at all be
tween the United States territory and
British Columbia south of Mount St.
Elias, where he 141 st meridian crosses
and marks a division of which there
is no dispute. South of that point, how
ever, the map mak'js it appear that all
the territory ia in the British posses
sions.
There is a legend written across the
face of this part of the map, reading:
'Undefined boundary." It requires a
second glance, however, to perceive
these words. Superintendent Pritchett
of the Coast and Geodetic Survey said
this evening with regard to the claim
of the Canadians to Dyea, Skaguay and
Juneau:
"We have no notice of any such claim
having been made. It probably arises
out of the indefinite marking of the
new map just issued by the Surveyor-
Oieneral at Ottawa. We do not know
officially that the Canadian Govern
ment ever in its map defined the bound
ary south of Mount St. Elias, but the
old treaty defining the English and
Russian possessions is very clear in de
fining the distance this boundary shall
bo located from the coast line. The
treaty now pending in the Senate for a
joint survey of the line between Alaska
and the British possessions will prob
ably put an end to this controversy.
Our maps are drawn in accordance
with the old treaty and the towns men
tioned are clearly within United States
territory."
The now official map of this region
is looked on as another English trick.
They will not acknowledge that there
is any defined boundary, and in the
meantime convey the impression by
their publications that they own every
thing clear to the Pacific Ocean. The
Toast and Geodetic Survey has just
completed the most accurate map yet
published of the Yukon district. It
shows the river in all its detail, with
the route of travel clearly defined to
those who wish to reach the gold fields
In that vicinity. It shows that at pres
ent the ocean vessels have to go as far
up as St. Michael, which is now the
center of a military reservation, having
a radius of 100 miles. At St. Michael
the vessels have to be unloaded and the
cargoes transferred to lighter draft
boats that can enter the mouth of the
Yukon, a long distance south of St.
Michael.
The United States survey will have
two parties nt work as soon as the
weather will permit, surveying the
mouth of the Yukon in an endeavor to
flr.'] a deep-water channel up that
river. Such a channel has been report
ed as and is marked tenta
tively on the new map. In case it is
finally located it 1s expected that
">. (-ail-going vessels can go right up the
river for hundreds of miles before it
becomes necessary to transfer cargoes.
This new map, taken in connection
with the one of Southeastern Alaska
issued a short time ago, gives the pub
lic the two great routes by which the
Klondike can be reached. The latter
map is a very clear outline: of the coun
try traversed from Juneau by way of
I>yea and Skaguay up through the
chain of lakes and various rivers until
the gold territory is reached.
The Government officials say that no
notice can be taken of the misleading
maps sent out in Canada unless there
is an official line designated that varies
from that laid down by the treaty.
THE HAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUISDAY, FEBBTTARY 6, 1898.
WILL BUILD AN
ELECTRIC LINE
New Railway to Connect
Los Angeles and Pasa
dena.
Officials of the Two Cities Peti
tioned for the Granting
of Franchises.
Motor Cars to Make the Run Each
Way on a Thirty-Five Minute
Schedule.
Bpcclal Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 6.â Within
ninety days Los Angeles and Pasadena
and the intervening suburbs are to be
connected by two more bonds of steel.
Colonel M. Thompson of Chicago, a
well-known street railroad builder, to
day filed an application with the Los
Angeles Board of Supervisors and with
the trustees of South Pasadena and
Pasadena, asking for a franchise to
construct an electric railroad from the
limits of Los Angeles to Pasadena, A
double track franchise is petitioned for.
Colonel Thompson acts as the repre
sentative of the Los Angeles Suburban
Railway Company, which is prepared
to Invest J500,000 in the enterprise, to
commence operations at once and carry
them to a conclusion as rapidly as cap
ital can' do the work.
The construction of this new double
track line to Pasadena will be an im
provement which will tend to build up
and develop a section of the county
which afff.-rds some of the moat charm
ing suburban residence spots in this
section of the State. It will materially
shorten the mileage between Los An
geles and Pasadena, as over the new
route the running time will be only 35
minutes, whereas 55 minutes are now
consumed in making the Journey by
electric railroad.
The new line will commence at Down
ey avenue and Prltchard srYeet in East
Los Angeles, and run in a northeasterly
direction six and one-half miles. It
will traverse the Mission road and pass
through the Estuelillo and Pico tracts
of 1000 acres. This will in the future
be known as the Tuxedo tract. It will
be boulevarded and improved in every
way to make it a spot for handsome
suburban residences. The line will
proceed down the Monterey road to
South Pasadena, thence along Palermo
avenue, skirting the Raymond Hrrtel
lands on the ww e st, up Raymond ave
nue into Pasadena, passing Hotel
Green to Union street, thence to Fair
Oaks avenue, thence to Vineyard street
and back to Raymond avenue. This
last portion forms a loop for a double
track.
The new company has completed and
signed an agreement with the Los An
geles Railway Company to use its
tracks from Downey avenue and
Pritchard street to enter the city of
Los Angeles. It also proposes to trans
fer to any and every street car line in
this city belonging to the Los Angeles
Railway Company.
The new company is- amply backed,
and the improvement which it proposes
to make will mark another epoch in the
growth and development of Southern
California. It will a!so result in great
advantage and benefit to the traveling
public.

TO THE PEOPLE
Los Angeles' Misnamed
League for Better
Government.
Management Assists the Water
Company Instead of the
City.
Member of the Syndicate Press Loses
the Official Printing to the
Record.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Fob. s.â The League
for Better City Government has thus
far utterly failed to give any aid, as
sistance or counsel to the people of Los
Angeles in the fight they are making
against the City Water Company to
obtain municipal control of the city's
plant. The fact is being generally
commented upon by citizens, and the
feeling has become quite general that
the controlling gpirits of the league
have been using that organization and
its influence against the interests of
the people in the 'water contest. Lead
ing members of the league when ap
proached and asked to identify them
selves with the people's aide of the
controversy, either refuse to talk or
proceed to make a lengthy defense of
the water company's programme to
mulct the city in the sum of hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
It is absolutely impossible at present
to get an expression from the league
directors in favor of the city's side of
the water fight. The rank and file of
the members of the league are unques
tionably in favor of bringing the water
company to terms, but the directing
spirits seem to be lined up with the
syndicated press in favor of the water
company's policy of delay. The. result
is that the League for Better City Gov
ernment is being looked upon by many
as an organization which was simply
given life in order that a few schemers
might use it to back and enforce the
nefarious plans of the local newspaper
combination of the Times, Herald and
Express.
This policy was partially outlined
when the league directorsâ a bare quo
rum of eight being presentâ passed
resolutions attempting to injure The
Call. The effect of those resolutions
has been to add several thousand
names to the list of regular patrons of
The Call in Los Angeles City.
The absolute failure of the organiza
tion to make itself felt or be heard
from in the water contest, the most
important battle that has ever been
fought in this city, has had the effect
of causing hundreds of people to de
nounce the league's present manage
ment as a simple tool of the water
company.
It is not too late, however, for th>Â»
league to come in and assist the peo
ple in making this fight, which is to de
termine whether corporations existing
by the suffrance of the city are bigger
than their maker.
One of the membf-rs of the syndicated
local press â the I, xprde6â received a
severe set back to-day. The finance
committee of the City Council took
from it the city printing and awarded
it to the Record for the ensuing year.
This makes the Record the official
papÂ«r of the city, which the Express
has been for a lnng period of years.
The Record will now increase its size
to eight pages. It is the only daily
newspaper published here that has
taken the side of the people in the
the water controversy.
The City Council will be called upon
on Monday to vote $2000 more to defray
expenses in the litigation over the
Crystal Pprings water rights. The
propositioD was made at the meeting of
the finance committee of the Council
to-day to transfer $2000 to the cash
fund to mm the expense. Councilman
Grider refused to vote to make the
transfer. H<- Raid that within two
months $3000 of the people's money had
been .spent in this matter and he could
not see that nnc particle of good had re
sulted. II f added that he was opposed
to spending any more of the public
funds in that wasteful way and went
on to state that the committee of thp
Council now investigating the source of
mountain water supply, of which he
was a member, would make its inves
titf.itinn and report and the expense to
the city would not be one dollar.
The supply committee has already
approved bills in the sum of $1500 on
account of th" Crystal Springs suit,
and they will he reported on Monday.
Chairman Toll of the supply committee
says that they will have to be paid
whether the funds were transferred or
not.
FATHER AND SON ON
THE RETIRED LIST.
Rear Admirals Thomas O. Selfridge,,

WASHINGTON, Feb. s.â Admiral Self
ridge, who has just relinquished the com
mand of the European station, went upon
the retired list of the navy with the close
of to-day, having reached the age fixed
by law. The event is entirely peculiar in
our naval history. in that there will be
presented the spectacle of father and son
both on the retired list on account of age,
after having reached the highest grade in
the navy. The father, Thomas O. Self
ridge, is now living In Washington. D. C.
having retired in 1868, after thirty-six and
a half years' service, and his name now
heads the naval retired list. ' The son,
likewise named Thomas O. Self ridge.' had
forty-five years' service to his credit
when he retired to-day. He sailed for the
United States from France to-day. By
his retirement Commodore Francis M.
Bunce, commandant of the New York navy
yard,' will become a 1a 1 rear ' admiral, and
Captain Winfleld Schley, the chairman of
the Lighthouse Board, becomes a commo
dore. Captain Silas E Casey, in command
of the League Island navy yard, goes up
to the grade of commodore as the result
of to-day's retirement and that of Ad
miral Beardslee a few days ago. 'Vi^,

Commissioner Carleton
Declines to Be Fooled
by the Moors.
So He Will Stay With Them
Until Satisfaction Is
Received.
Now He Is With the Army Which
Went Out to " Eat Up Dogs" Who
Refused to Pay Taxes.
Correnpondence of The Call.
TANGIER, Morocco. Jan. 20.â 1f the
Sherefan Government, has found Harry
Carleton, the United States special
commissioner, a thorn in its side dur
j Ing the present campaign It has only
itself to thank. It has unhesitatingly
undertaken to perform anything and
everything without the sllghest inten
j tion of complying with its promises.
| After the Unit.-d States cruiser Raleigh
j visited this coast last spring and the
J United States representative had failed
to obtain satisfaction Mr. Carleton was
sent to the Moorish court to demand
an immediate reply to the American
demands. He left the Raleigh at an
chor off Mazagan, and on arriving at
Marriakesh with his dispatch the Gov
ernment wished to bring into play their
| customary policy of procrastination,
but, when the commissioner informed
them that he was ordered to return to
the ship within twenty-four hours
after his arrival at Marrakesh with or
without an answer the Sultan's advis
ers, whose sole idea was to get the
American ships out of Moorish waters,
gave a verbal reply to the effect that
instructions would be given to the Sul
tan's Foreign Minister at Tangier to
settle the principal claims at once, and
that the minor ones would be inquired
into at no dlÃtant date.
On Mr. Carleton's return he, after
waiting for a reasonable time to elapse,
called on Sid Mohammed Torres to
learn what had been done, but was as
sured by the Sultan's minister that no
instructions had been received from the
Government with regard fo the Amer
ican claims. When more than suffi
cient time had passed for Sid Moham
med Torres to write to and receive a
reply from the court, it was found that
the minister had received no communi
cation on the matter. Mr. Carleton was
sent to obtain in writing the promise
which had only been given to him ver
bally. On arriving at Marrakesh the
usual evasive policy was pursued, till
at last, just before the departure of
the court, the commissioner is said to
have been informed that the members
of the Moorish Government were sorry
that they could not attend to United
States affairs at present, as the Sultan
was going to "eat up the dogs" who
had refused to pay their taxes and
"laugh in the beards" of his governors.
Mr. Carleton. said he could not return
with such a message to his chief, so he
would follow the court till there was a
lull in hostilities, when no doubt the
Government would find time to attend
to his business. Every effort was made
to dissuade him from taking this step,
but he remained firm. Since he has
been with the army every device has
been resorted to â and the Moorish
court possesses manyâ to persuade him
to return to Tangier, but he haa re
fused to budge. He is expected to re
turn here shortly to give an account
to his chief of what he had achieved up
to the end of the year, and report the
present state of affairs to the new rep
resentatives. It is believed that on his
return an authentic account of Mulley
Abdul Aszi's military expedition will
be obtainable.

RAIN BENEFITS
GROWING CROPS
Showers Fall in Many
Sections of the
State.
Come in Time to Put Dollars
Into the Farmers'
Pockets.
Impetus Given to Fruit and Grain by
the Downpour From tha
Skies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. Feb. s.â The rain which the
farmers of this vicinity have been
waiting anxiously for these many days
began to fall early this evening. A
drizzling rain fell all evening, with an
occasional spirited downpour, and the
indications are favorable to an all-night
shower. It will mean many dollars in
the pockets of the farmers, who had
about begun to despair. All the sown
grain had begun to suffer and it is
known that a considerable portion of it
has rotted in the ground. One farmer
in this vicinity said the other day that
he had $11,000 in the ground and unless
rain soon came he would lose every
cent of it. He said the seed had rotted,
but with the rain he could re-sow and
thus get some return for his money and
labor.
The farmers in the light soil, how
ever, have examined their seed In the
ground and find that it has germinated
and with rain will do all right. If the
moisture had been delayed much longer
all the grain would have rotted.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 6.â There is every
prospect to-night of a good rainfall. It
has been showering at intervals since
6 o'clock, and the sky is still cloudy,
with wind from the north. Up to date
neither the grain nor the orchards have
suffered, though failure in the former
case will be certain uniess the rains
come soon. The heavy and cov.ttnued
frosts of the past month have been a
blessing to the fruit trees, as they have
kept back the buds. With an ordinary
amount of rain this spring the fruit
crop must be large.
SAN DIEGO, Feb. s.â Generally
speaking, crop prospects in this county
are better than the average at this
time of the season. In this city the
rainfall to date is 3.11 inches. In some
parts of the county it is considerably
more. But, although the total is small,
the precipitation has come at the right
time to be of most service. There has
been a large increase in the area of
both barley and wheat, and plowing
and seeding are nearly completed.
With a fair amount of rain well dis
tributed during the remainder of the
season there will be ample crops.
STOCKTON, Feb. s.â Rain com
menced in a light fall about noon to
day, and continued most of the time
until evening, when a steady downpour
set in. Reports from the valley are
that the rain was quite general, but
nowhere heavy. Lodl had a good sup
ply. Merced was getting quite a duck
ing late in the afternoon. *
SACRAMENTO, Feb. s.â Rain began
falling here at noon to-day and is still
coming down to-night. More than a i
half inch has fallen, and it promises to
be a good, heavy storm. In this and
adjoining counties grain has been in
splendid condition all along, albeit a lit
tle backward on account of the cold
weather In January. Crops in this
county and north of here could have
withstood two weeks more without
rain, but of course will be greatly bene
fited by the moisture. As it is the
farmers are all happy. The open
weather enabled them to plant every !
acre they wanted to put in, and with
timely spring rains there will be
abundant crops.
Threatened With Destruction.
i^OIANAPOLIS, Feb. 5.â A special
from Muncle, Ind., to the Sentinel says:
At midnjght the town of Albanj- is on
fire and is threatened with total destruc
tion. The loss will be heavy.

A woman who suffers from any ailment of
the delicate special organism of her sex,
feels something more than pain and physi-
cal wretchedness. ; She is mortified with a
sense of womanly incompleteness.
But no woman need remain under this
cloud of misery and dissatisfaction. Dr.
"Pierces Favorite Prescription positively
cures all diseased conditions and weak-
nesses, and restores complete health "and
strength to the feminine organs.
It is the only medicine of its kind devised
for this one purpose by an educated and ex-
perienced physician, and eminent specialist
in this particular field of practice.
It is the only medicine which can be Relied,
upon to make the ordeal of motherhood
absolutely safe and almost painless.
" I cannot say too much for Dr. Pierces Favor-
ite Prescription," writes Miss Clara Baird, of
Bridgeport, Montgomery Co., Penn'a. "I feel it
tny duty to say to all women who may be suffer-
ing from any disease of the womb that it is thÂ«
best medicine on earth for them to use. I cannot
praise it too highly for the good it did me. If
any one doubts this give them my name and

BURYING THE ZOO SCHEME.
WHEN a scheme for plundering the public has
been once well devised and put into the form
of a job which has the attractive appearance
01 a municipal improvement, it is hard to kill. The
people of San Francisco are having an experience of
this truth in their struggle- against the zoo park
scheme. It was killed last fall to all outward seeming
as dead as a doornail, but is nevertheless reviving and
coming to the front again like a weed which when
once rooted in the soil defies all attempts to eradi
cate it.
There are many elements of persistent vitality in
the job. In the first place there is big money in it.
In the second place there is a chance for the pro
moters of the job to pose as public spirited citizens
seeking the general welfare of the community. The
big money gives the means for a divy
among a large number of people. The
pretended public improvement affords a plaus
ible pretext by which to deceive the un
wary. Thus there is in the scheme ample entice
ments for both knaves and fools, and it is not sur
prising that it survives one defeat and still flourishes,
a promising boodle plant, in the municipal field.
A scheme of this kind, if the people were at all in
different or careless on the subject, would be sure to
succeed. Fortunately they are not indifferent, nor
are they likely to be so. It is notable that every
time the scheme presents itself opposition awakens at
once vigilant and active. This spirit of individual
zeal to guard the public interest against a boodling
job is particularly noticeable in the Mission, where
the full extent of the scheme is best understood. The
taxpayers and voters generally in that section of the
city are as alert to-day as they were in the height of
the fight over the proposition when it was presented
last fall.
The Mission people intend to make effective work
in killing the scheme this time. They will show by
mass meeting and by protest such indignant objec
tion to it as will render futile and worthless any at
tempt to accomplish it. In this they will have the
support of the taxpayers in all portions of the city.
The people, in fact, are tired of having this malodo"
ous job thrust under their noses. They will make
sure of killing it by burying it this time, and if it is
ever dug up again they will next time bury with it
every man who advocates it.
We had occasion some time ago to commend the
Examiner for its newly acquired practice of publish
ing affidavits certifying the truth of any story in its
columns which could be verified in that way. The
commendation was well intended, but it has led the
Examiner into excess in the affidavit line, for that
paper is now engaged day after day in getting affi
davits certifying the accuracy of news published in
The Call on the previous day. Thus it followed The
Call's publication of the statement of Young Mitchell
concerning the price asked for the^ issue of permits
for prize fights with an affidavit from Mitchell, and
yesterday it followed up The Call's story of the con
fession and arrest of Frank Belew with affidavits and
certificates from a host of officials of Solano County.
This work is entirely unnecessary and uncalled for.
When the Examiner takes news from The Call it
should simply state the fact and then the people will
know that the news is accurate.
The people who know the least about the war scare
over European aggression on the Chinese coast are
probably the Chinese themselves, and it is likely they
are also the people who care least. That wonderful
yellow race has never failed to absorb every conquer
ing race that overran it in war, and the attempt of
any European nation to build dominion there would
be about as futile as an attempt to erect a tower on
a quagmire.
One of the pleasing features of the situation of the
controversy over the equipment of the street cars with
safety devices is the prospect that we shall now get
the fenders without the boodle gang in the Board of
Supervisors getting that long desired $500 apiece.
This is a case where economy is as sweet to the public
as a pleasure that would have cost money enough to
burn a wet dog.
In default of getting the news of the arrest of Frank
Belew until the day after it was published in The
Call, the Examiner yesterday made a great display
of certificates to the effect that it had long ago
guessed he was guilty. This morning it will probably
assert that the guessing was enterprise and claim it
as a scoop.
The Oakland bridegroom who two hours after his
marriage told his bride "Now I have you where I
want you and I will do what I please with you"
clearly mistook the situation, as he will find out when
she gets the divorce she has applied for and gives him
thr ha ha while enjoying her alimony.
THAT AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN.
r\ S the annexation press prints the tripartite
j~\ agreement and particulars of the triple alliance
* * between Dole, Hoshi and the United States
without deprecation, but with tacit approval, it is
necessary for American farmers and white labor to
be on the alert. We wisli now to warn California
that if this State assent to annexation it will here
after protest in vain against the new source of supply
for coolie labor. It was only after years of education,
costly agitation and many demonstrations of violence
that we succeeded in getting Federal legislation to
â¢ heck the invasion of Chinese coolies. And then it
took years of effort to secure the useful enforcement
of this legislation, overcoming on one hand Asiatic
subtlety, and on the other the corrupt greed of
American officials.
With annexation following this new triple alliance,
such means as we used against the Chinese will not
make a ready impression. With one of our Senators
declaring that his vote for the treaty is not a persona!
act. but is done in deference to the wish of a ma
jority of the people of California, we occupy the po
sition of willing assent to an act that future distress
and necessity will compel us to repudiate. And
when we do the charge that with all the facts before
us we assented to it will nullify our importunities and
deafen the ears of the country to our appeals, no mat
ter how frantic they may become nor how well
grounded in the condition of our farmers and our
labor.
To get a view of the conditions to be made perma
nent by the agreement which Dole came here to se
cure we may turn to the official report made by
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald on his return from
Hawaii last summer. Now he is toiling for annexa
tion, Japanese coolies and .all, but at that time he
used this language:
"My investigation through the Hawaiian Islands
has brought to my attention many new conditions
and phases of labor, the most important of which is
the Asiatic hordes that now infest the islands and pre
dominate in numbers on the plantations. I have seen
20.000 bare-footed laborers, half of whom work under
a penal contract. I have seen a reward offered for
their arrest when they violated their contract and left
the plantation and their number printed across their
photograph in convict style. I have seen four or five
hundred Japanese walk ten miles to back up the po
sition of one man when only a few days' work was
involved. I have seen murder upon the plantations
in riot. I have heard the Japanese say that their peo
ple have brought the sugar industry to the position
which it now occupies and that they propose to hold
the controlling influence upon the islands at any haz
ard. I have seen them demanding that white men
should be discharged and Japanese taken in their
place. I have seen one of our American men-of-war
anchored in the harbor for the purpose of defending
the planter aginst his own labor, and I have seen a
warship of Japan at its side, simply to encourage the
Japanese upon the islands in their arrogance and in
sulting behavior and to further demand that more
be added to the already overburdened condition. On
the plantations the number and nationality of labor
is, by the last report, 1615 Hawaiians, 2268 Portu
guese, 12,893 Japanese, 6289 Chinese and about 715 of
other nationalities. The Hawaiians are the best work
men. It needs no words to paint the future of these
islands when once the Japanese become the employers
of help, the moneyed power and the labor itself."
Against this somber background is thrown the re
cent Dole agreement. Let it be remembered, too, that
the ronditions so vividly painted by the Labor Com
missioner were deliberately created by the Doie
Government and by it maintained. Its power has bec-i;
absolute. No popular vote ha~ been permitted to .ii;-
lodge it or to interfere with its will. It has been
supreme. It could have prevented that which it has
chosen to permit, therefore its permission is a cer
tificate to its belief that such coolie labor is necessary,
and that this necessity is among "the peculiar condi
tions and the needs of labor" referred to by President
McKinley in his message, and had in mind by Oli
garch Dole when he said, "I believe the United
States will give us separate laws to secure the labor
we need." All of this fits into the new agreement,
into an act that makes the question an international
one with Japan, and therefore removes it further
away from the power of the people of the United
States to change when its results are reflected in the
distress and disappointment of our own people.
There is but one course for the United States to
safely pursue. This is pointed out by the resolution
offered by Senator White, which is simply a renewal
of the Turpie resolution of 1894, by which the islands
are neutralized, made independent and left to work
out their own problems under the physical conditions
which make those problems peculiar to them and of
fensive to us.
SIGNS OF PROSPERITY.
r\ CCORDING to the Brooklyn Times the office
/ \ boys employed in some of the largest buildings
* in that city laid plans to form a trades union
to redress their grievances. They met, discussed the
matter thoroughly and- finally decided to organize as
& baseball club.
The incident is a whimsical but none the less re
liable sign of the times. Men of all classes, wage
earners, producers, merchants, professional men,
meet now as formerly to discuss their grievances, be
cause under the Democratic regime they got in the
habit of it. The longer the discussion goes on, how
ever, the less they find to grieve over, so each com
pany in its own way finally decides to organize for
the enjoyment of prosperity. The baseball nine takes
the place of the grievance committee, and the strike
that means a home run is the only strike that captures
the crowd.
In San Francisco we have had this winter a most
gratifying evidence of revived prosperity. That evi
dence is to be found in the absence from our civic
life of the problem of the unemployed. For many
winters past we have been disturbed by that problem.
We met it in one way or another as often as it came
up and managed in each crisis to provide a temporary
solution, but never altogether put an end to it. The
unemployed remained with us each winter until the
beginning of work on the farms and in the orchards
of the interior drew many workers from the city and
relieved the strain until the succeeding November.
This season no such problem has presented itself.
The clamor of industry seeking work and wages has
not been heard. There are of course some workers
still out of employment, but there are no longer great
masses of them. We have had no occasion to take
up contributions for boulevards or any other kind of
public enterprise. Labor and trade have no longer
any grievances or are too busy to Iv.ve time to meet
and complain of them.
The change is the more notable because the lack
of rain has prevented the beginning of work in the
rural districts which at this season usually employs
so many men in the fields and orchards. The indus
tries of this city alone seem to have revived to an ex
tent which enables them to furnish work for nearly all.
Had the due proportion of rain fallen during the fall
THE SAN FRANCIStx, CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1898.
and early winter the farms of the State would now
be the scenes of busy activity and the industry of Cal
ifornia would be enjoying a boom.
Protective legislation is doing its work well. In
spite of droughts and unpropitious weather it is fur
nishing employment for the people and bringing
prosperity to all. From East to West the good in
fluence is felt. The principles of Republicanism are
vindicated by their results. There is once more hope
in the heart of the American worker and comfort in
his home.
' I 'HE "investigation" undertaken by the Finance
j Committee of the Board of Supervisors on Fri
* day into the charge of attempted blackmail
brought against Captain Delany throws completely
into the shade the funniest farce-comedy ever put
upon the stage in San Francisco. If the thing had
a plot its opera bouffe features would commend it to
the immortal Gilbert. If there were, any sense in it
Hoyt would pay a heavy royalty for the privilege of
putting the irresponsible "Cappun" before the foot
lights. No wonder the risibilities of the town have
been irritated at the spectacle. The investigation is
enough to excite the humor of a horse.
In the first place, the Committee on Health and
Police consists of Delany, Rivers, Haskins, Devany
and Rottanzi. This committee has charge of the pub
lic pound, and it is supposed that in making his pro
position to the representative of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Captain Delany
spoke for his colleagues as well as for himself. In
deed, it is alleged that in the prize ring permit mat
ter Haskins did speak for the committee. If there
is any truth in the charges it is safe
to say that the members of the Commit
tee on Health and Police have an understand
ing as to percentages. The Finance Committee, which
attempted to "investigate" the matter, consists of
Rottanzi, Devany and Haskins. Here then are two
Supervisors at least who belong to the pound com
bine sitting in judgment upon the action of the chair
man of the combine.
But as if this were not sufficiently laughable, the
line of inquiry developed on Friday was calculated
to produce an explosion. The Finance Committee
apparently did not consider Delany on trial at all.
It at once assaulted Wadham, the complaining wit
ness, and permitted Delany to prove in detail that
he is a liar, a blackguard, an associate of criminals
and generally a person of wretched character. Evi
dently the committee assumed that Wadham had
been charged with attempting to extort $500 from
Delany. All it asked of the latter was a general de-
nial. Under the circumstances it is somewhat strange
that it did not report Wadham to the Grand Jury for
indictment. Surely his offense of reflecting upon the
integrity of the angelic Delany is more than heinous.
One point, however, the committee seems to have
overlooked. Captain Delany testified that he talked
with Wadham about the amount of money the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has in its
treasury. Delany heard the amount was $18,000, and
he says he innocently asked Wadham about it. But
he said nothing regarding a $500 fee for giving the
pound to the society. To the average man it will ap
pear somewhat strange that the Supervisor should be
so deeply interested in the financial standing of the
society. In any event, a record which contains this
admission by the captain looks bad. The Finance
Committee should expunge the testimony on the
ground that it is incompetent, irrelevant and imma
terial. Doubtless on reflection Delany will consider
that he should not have said it. as that is a good rea
son tor striking it out.
For the rest it is sufficient to say that the next time
the committee meets it should hire an orchestra and
open at one of the theaters. It is a shame that so
much fun should be confined to ?o small an audience
as met with the committee on Friday.
ARTILLERY ammunition tests made at the
Presidio have disclosed so large a proportion
of worthless shrapnel among the shells fired
as to lead to the conclusion that fully 50 per cent of
the stock of that kind of ammunition at the post is
virtually worthless. It appears the wall of the shell
is not sufficiently strong to resist the concussion of
the propelling charge of powder, anil the shell, in
stead of being effective at the point desired, explodes
almost as soon as it leaves the gun.
The ammunition tested is not old. It was furnished
to supply the new breech-loading rifled cannon with
which the light batteries of artillery have been re
cently equipped, and is a part of that new de
fense system the development and extension of which
the country has watched with so much gratification.
It is the first warning we have had that the ammuni
tion on which our soldiers in battle would have to de
pend for victory, and our cities for defense, is
defective, and the issue is therefore a matter of grave
public concern.
The discovery of defective armor plate supplied for
our new warships disclosed not long ago that the
supervision of the equipments of the navy was either
careless and inefficient or else corrupt. The people
v/ere loth to attribute any of the fault in that case
to the officers of the navy, and by common consent
the manufacturers of the plate were blamed. It was
noted with surprise, however, that none of the manu
facturers were punished, that the offense was con
doned and the matter hushed up at Washington.
The present discovery of so large a proportion of
worthless shrapnel in the ammunition supplied to the
army will recall the old scandal of defective armor
plate in the navy, and this time there will be less
willingness on the part of the people to let the affair
pass as one of little moment. It is time to have an
investigation, not only of the contractors who furnish
supplies for the army and the navy, but of the depart
ments at Washington that test and accept them.
The evil is the more serious because of the manner
in which the report of the discovery is said to have
been received by the War Office at Washington.
General Flagler, chief of ordnance, when questioned
on the subject said: "This is a matter of small im
portance, as the shells are used in small caliber or
field guns and have no relation whatever to high
power gun defense." He added, "The first lot fur
nished by the American Ordnance Company, tested
some time ago, was reported to be satisfactory, and
the fact that a great proportion of those tried at the
Presidio were defective need not worry the San Fran
cisco people.''
If the ordnance office of the War Department takes
that view of a discovery that 50 per cent of a certain
class of ammunition furnished the army is defective,
it is not likely that contractors will be very careful
to improve the ammunition hereafter. To the popu
lar mind the issue is by no means a matter of small
importance. If this country is to prepare for war in
time of peace it should prepare for it with a quality
of ammunition that will be effective when war comes.
Various of the powers are finding that the rule of
honor among thieves is not accepted by the thief who
has the biggest club.
AN OFFICIAL COMEDY.
DEFECTIVE AMMUNITION.
DANNY FOLEY'S GOATS;
OR,
WHY THE MISSION BOY HATES THE POUNDMAN.
Danny Foley had a goat. That is to say, Danny Foley
had two goats. The big black one, the mother goat, was
Nan. The small one. Nan's daughter, was called Nannie.
Nannie was white, and Nannie had been so petted and
spoiled as a child that, though she had reached years of
discretionâ which In goatville means that she rivaled old
Nan's two quarts at milking timeâ she could never be in
duced to abide by rulee and regulations.
It is Impossible to explain to a Mission coatâ be she
white or black. Nan or Nannieâ the logic of the pound
keeper. Self-preservation being the first law of goat na
ture, and the giving of plentiful rich milk a conscientious
goat's whole duty, where is the senee in refraining from
cropping the short, sw.eet, new grass that has sprung up
all over the Mission hills after the rain?
Nannie beheld the rounded hills with their emerald
covering. And without a word to staid Nan, she sped up
and out the few steps to the street, below which Danny
Foley's yard Is sunk about six feet. A poet like Daudot
could tell you how Nannie enjoyed her freedom and the
fresh grass the rain had called forth. But her joy was cut
short by the appearance of old Nan. Nan had missed
Mademoiselle Nannie. She had stood for a moment in
deep thought. Then she, too, but with a deliberate, digni
fied four-step, had mounted the short stairway and fol
lowed on the track of her runaway daughter.
It must be confessed that Nan was not so stern as she
should have been when she discovered the abandoned young
woman luxuriating in the moist young grass. But it must
be remembered that Nannie's position in the Foley family
out on Army street, near Sanchez, had always been a priv
ileged one. Nan decided wisely that as she had found the
young scapegrace, she, too, might as well eat hay while the
sun shone.
When small Danny Foley in his brown overalls, his
gingham shirt and his shapeless old' cap, found the two, they
were disgracefully exhilarated, the effect partly of too much
liberty, partly of too much grass.
Danny chid Nan. She should have known better, he told
her. Nan made no answer, but out of the corner of her
meek, red eyes she looked at Nannie. Nannie flirted her
graceless heels toward the blue Mission sky. Repentance,
much less confession, was far from her unregenerate heart.
So Nan had to be the black coat, and walk in sorrow and
ehame ahead, listening to Danny's repeated reproaches,
bearing the insult and injury of the switch Danny bore; and
hypocritical Nannie permitted her old mother to suffer in
silence, while she assumed a virtuous, vei-y youthful air of
Innocence, which was altogether convincing to Danny, who
is as susceptible as any. Irishman, old or young, to female
Nan sulked on in advance. She had almost reached the
stairs now that lead down to Foley's back yard when the
tragedy occurred. ,
Like a thunderstorm on a summer day, with the resist
less swirl of a woman bound for the bargain counter, or a
man for a prize fight, the Assyrianâ that is to say, the
poundmanâ swooped down, a wolf on the fold.
Danny made a few remarks. They were couched in lan
guage of which his pretty, youthful, gray-eyed, dark-haired
Irish mother would probably have disapproved.
But Danny's eloquence was in vain. Danny is only 10,
and, very likely, he is too young to do the subject justice,
n hen Danny is older, now, the chances aie that the pound
manâif any of that barbarous species surviveâ will not find
Danny Foley at a loss to put into words his opinion of
sneaks in general, and poundmen in particular.
Danny bade Nannie an affectionate farewell. He had
always loved the small sinner. When she and he were kids
togetherâ Danny is 10, which means that Danny is a man in
his own estimation nowâ they had played and slept andâ yes,
eaten together. As to Nan, Danny had no kind word for the
old black goat. It was all her fault, he told her, savagely,
for loading poor little Nannie away from home.
So the poundman took the two from the very threshold
of Mrs. Foley's little place, and the great city of San Fran
cisco became $5 richer in consequence. For a thrifty man
out that way bought Danny Foley's goats, little Mrs." Foley
b<>ing unable to afford the sum which would have given back
to her her own.
But Danny Foley belongs to a powerful, though an un
organized society. He is a full member of that great insti
tution of Young America, which pretends to an observance
of the law.s laid down by the community, but is in reality
amenable only to its own lawless public opfnion.
The poundmen, therefore, have to reckon now with Boy
ville. The boys of the Mission are leagued against them.
Each new story that comes to light, revealing the methods
of the poundmen, adds a recruit to the already potent au
thority of the Mission Boy.
The Mission Boy has heard with disgust the tale of
Mrs. Madison's five cows. He knows how hard the poor wo
man '"worked up" from one cow to five: how she supported
her invalid husband and herself by means of these same
cows; how a spiteful neighbor distorted the facts in the case,
so that Mrs. Madison's meek sources of revenue appeared
to be trespassing. He tells with rage of the appearance
of the poundmen at 2 o'clock at night, and of the Highland
raid which resulted in Mrs. Madison's five cows becoming a
charge of the city. He knows that the poor, hard-working
woman was not notified of the contemplated seizure, and he
also knows that she had to pay 120 â a great sum for people
dependent on a five-cow dairyâ before her property was
given back to her. He remembers that the timid woman,
ignorant of the operation of red tape and fearful of the
mighty officials, sold her one means of making a living at a
loss, so fearful was she of the unknown dangers she might
meet in her encounter with the valiant poundmen.
The Mission Boy tells you of the seizure of a widow's
one goat, which was tethered out on the swelling hill, while
its owner sat beside it milking it. He multiplies instances
of wh.it to him is a high-handed, unfair, even cruel pro
ceeding. He points to the unoccupied hills teeming with
grass. He shows you Mrs. Madison's little home, the very
last house upon the hill. He says, boastfully, that when
summer comes he and his gang will set fire to the dried
grass that remains on these hills, just for pure sport. And
he asks you, why in the nameâ not of the strict letter of a
strained law â but of common sense and charity, the house
wives at the extreme end of the Mission world, who are as
thrifty ac they are poor, may not benefit by nature's gener
osity.
But the Mission Boy, after all, is not given to words. He
knows a better argument â deeds. He has declared war
against the poundman.
There is no skulking cur so mean that he will not now
take it under his protection. When the poundman appears,
a small satellite, not in conjunction, but full of opposition,
appears also. If there remain in the canine outcast the
faintest remnant of his once strong instinct, if he can ap
preciate a hint, if he be clever enough to recognize a
friendly warning, the poundman loses this particular dog.
To be sure, he sometimes revenges himself by casting the
> Mission Boy into the wag-m of snarling dogs as a temporary
substitute for the one which has escaped. But boy-life is
long and philosophical. All one has to do is to struggle out
and away with an additional grudge against the common
enemy, and to form one's self Into a perpetual committee
of one to continue to harass and defeat the poundman wher
ever and whenever It is possible.
When you remember what an active committee one boy
Is, and then multiply that activity by the Mission Boy in
general, you'll realize the difficulties in the poundman's way,
and if you're thinking of serving San Francisco, you'll prob
ably decide that it shall be in some other capacity.
THE "SCOOP" OF THE YEAR
fHanjeda Enclnal.
The Call scored one of the most not
able "scoops" In many a day in Its
exclusive account of the arrest of
Frank Belew, the alleged murderer of
his brother and sister at Dixon. It
was a good piece of work well done.
And by the way, the manner in which
the case has been worked up by the
officers of Solano County Is a good
example for the city "sleuths." They
can well take lessons from some of
the hayseed officers. If they had a
little of their- detective ability some
of the many unexplained and unpun
ished murders in the city would be
fore this have been solved.

ace. Hp was on a visit of pleasure, sn<l,
after spending a few days in taking in
the sights of the city, departed for Moite
rey, not notifying the hotel people whim
he was going or that he expected to
shortly return. After his departure v
handsome cane was found in the apart
ments he had been occupying, which win
turned in to the office. The cane attract
ed the fancy of both Clerk O'Brien and
Clerk Cummings. and, as the strangÂ«r
had left no address, they, rather than sea
such an artistic bit of wood go tp wastt,
decided to match for the possession of 11.
Cummings won, and finding the stick too
long for his rather short figure, he took
It to a dealer in such articles, where it
was considerably shortened and a new"
! ferule put on It. When Cummings re
ceived It back he became disatisfled with
it, so, after using It for a day or two, he
approached O'Brien and, finding that gen
j tleman's admiration for the staff as
warm as ever offered to sell It to him for
$2. The bargain was effected and every
one was happy. The next day the strang
er returned from Del Monte and entering
the hotel went up to Cummings and said:
"When I left here a few days ago I
overlooked a cane that I brought with
me. Have you seen anything of It?"
"Yes," said Cummings. "it was found
in your room and turned In here; if you
ask that gentleman"â pointing to O'Brien
â"he will give it to you."
The stranger moved up to the other end
Of the desk and repeated his question.
O'Brien's face dropped about a foot, and
going down behind the counter he fished
up his $2 purchase and handed it over
without a word. The stranger looked at
it for a moment, then said:
"This is certainly my stick, but In some
unaccountable manner It seems to hava
grown much shorter in the few days I
have been away. I have heard many
tales of the remarkable growths pro
duced by your wonderful climate and
have, heretofore, been rather skeptical,
but, after this I am ready to swallow
anything. I can no longer use it myself,
so I will take it home for my son."
O'Brien is waiting for the climate to
perform another miracle and cause his $2
bill to bloom again.

after thoroughly sizing him up, said: "As

you can give some explanation of how
you came that way."
"Well, your honor," answered the pris
oner, "it was like this: You see, I went
out to the track in the afternoon, and. as
things were coming my way, I made a
pretty good stake. When I got back in
town I thought, as I had been getting the
worst of it for a long time, I would force
my luck a bit while the ball was rolling

playing whisky straight, the police to

All the new, steam schooners that
were built especially for the lumber
coasting trade are now being trans
formed in passenger steamers. The
Dirigo, which was intended for the
Grays Harbor lumber trade, is now
being built up to accommodate 200 first
class passengers and 300 in the steer
age. She is a somewhat larger vessel
than the well-known Humboldt, being
185 feet long, 35 feet broad and 14 feet
deep. She was built by P. Matthews of
Grays Harbor, and. her machinery is
being put in by the Fulton Iron Works.
She has very fine lines and should eas
ily prove herself to be a 14-knot boat.
The steam schooner Samoa, which
â was launched from the Fulton Iron
T\ ..rks yesterday, will also go on the
I>yea-Skaguay route. She was intend
ed for the Humboldt Bay lumber trade,
and was named after the Samoa mills,
owned by J. R. Hanify & Co., but her
owners think that there will be more
money in the passenger trade this
spring than in the lumber business.
The steam schooner Fulton, built at
Eureka for the lumber trade,
is also to be used In the
Klondike rush. She was towed
down by the tug Sea King, and will
have her machinery put in and- her
deck houses built up in order to get
into the passenger trade before the
month is out.
The South Coast, which is also in
tended for the Klondike trade, has had
new boilers put in and her forecastle
raised. Her repairs will be completed
the latter part of this week, and she
Will get away on her first trip about
to-morrow week.
The river steamer H. C. Grady is also
being got ready in Oakland Creek for
service on the Yukon River. Some
time last year she was brought down
here from Portland and put in the fruit
trade betweeri Oakland and Sacramento
River points. She did not pay expenses
and was finally sold by the United
States Marshal for the amount of her
debts. She was purchased by some
Oakland parties, and now they have
sold her to the Alaska Venture Asso
ciation, who will fit her out and have
her towed to St. Michael.
The old tug Mary Ann, which was
brought here from Eureka and con
demned, is again to be put in commis
sion. Some time ago her engines were
taken out and the hull put on the mud
flats in Oakland Creek. Now, however,
she is to be overhauled and rigged as
a schooner, passenger accommodations
put in, and she will carry passengers
to the Klondike.
It was reported yesterday that the
â Â» Alaska-Yukon" Transportation Com
* pany had sold its river steamers to the
â¢ Ltebes Company. This is emphatically
denied by President Barling of the
Alaska-Yukon Company, who says that
the river steamers -will run on the Yu

theirs only.

sold and that no one but himself has
any right to sell accommodations on
the Northern Light.
The ship Tacoma, from New York
â¢â¢ for the Sound, and the Reefer, from
Philadelphia for San Francisco, have
both been sold to the Alaska Packers'

SCANDAL IN
THE SCHOOL

Director I^agan Accused
of Selling Positions by
Teacher Kjlpatricl^.
A. W. Atbertoa Â«- the

of 'the lliisine*s Evening
School, and who will tes

cation 8300 for a position
in the institution.
It is a fortunate thing for the mem
bers of the present Grand Jury that
there is a law requiring that there be
two grand juries impaneled each
year. The framers of the law were
evidently gifted with the power of look
ing far into the future, for had there
been no limitation to the time of ex
istence of the inquisitorial body, there
is no doubt but that the citizens on the
present jury would die of old age before
they concluded half of the work now
before them. The law was possibly
drawn with a view of the present con
dition of affairs.
Dr. D. F. Ragan, a member of the
School Board, is the latest public of
ficial to be charged with trying to en
rich himself by virtue of the power of
the position he occupies.
Elbert C. Kilpatrick, principal of the
Business Evening School, charges that
Dr. Ragan sold a position as substitute
teacher for $300, and that at the proper
time he will be able to prove the truth
of his assertion. Dr. Ragan in reply
says that his accuser has an absolute
disregard for the truth, and he is
backed up in his declaration by Daniel
E. Stanton. who is said by Kilpatrick
to have paid the money. Stanton, in a
sworn affidavit, avers that Dr. Ragan
is sinned against instead of sinning,
and that Kilpatrick endeavored to get
him to take a hand in a scheme to
"Job" Director Ragan.
The story of the alleged bribery, di
vested of all unnecessary verbiage, is
a simple one. Kilpatrick claims that
Stanton, in the hearing of another par
ty, who was concealed, admitted that
he had been compelled to pay $300 to
Dr. Ragan before securing a position
as substitute teacher in the Business
Evening School. The money was paid

under promise that Stanton would later
on be given a permanent place in the
department. Stanton denies that he had
a conversation of that nature with Kil
patric'k and Dr. Ragan says that his
accuser is actuate* by malice,
the case stands and the Grand Jury
will be asked to decide the controversy.
The whole case hinges on the testi
mony of Stanton, and he says very em
phatically that he refused to be a tool
in the hands of Kilpatrick. When in
terviewed last night, Stanton declined
to make any statement other than what
is contained in an affidavit sworn to
before Notary Public Turner. "I have
nothing to add to what is contained in
my sworn statement." said he, "and
that tells the whole story."
The affidavit referred to by Stanton
is as follows:
"I have been employed anQ am act
ing as a substitute teacher in the Busi
ness Evening ' School at the southeast
corner of Bush and Stockton streets,
which is a part of the Public School
Department of this city and county,
since on or about the 20th day of Sep
tember, 1897; that at tha>t date and ever
since E. G. Kilpatrick Has been and is
the principal of that evening school;
that on several occasions in the school,
the first of which was some time in the
month of November. 1*97, Kilpatrick
had conversations with me, in which he
asked me whether or not I had paid
money to obtain my position as such
substitute. I told him repeatedly and
emphatically that I had not paid any
money nor any price, nor reward of
any kind to anybody whomsoever for
the position. He replied that that was
all right to say so, but he knew better;
that positions in the School Department
were not obtained in that way; that
they had been paid for; that he (Kil
patrick) had paid $500 for his position,
and he repeatedly urged me to say
that I had paid for mine. I told him I
had not, and that was the truth.
"Then he asked me why I did not
get appointed permanently as a regu
lar teacher in the department. I re
plied that I was doing my best to do
so, but that there were so many others
that seemed to have stronger influence
with the Board of Education that I
would probably have to wait. He said
that I need not wait; that if I would
put up one hundred dollars he would
fix it for me and get me appointed
right away. He said that he already
had five or six members of the Board
of Education under his control. He
intimated that he wanted fifty of the
hundred dollars for himself; and he
proposed to me to use the other fifty
for the purpose of entrapping School
Director Dr. D. F. Ragan and compell
ing him to assist me in getting ap
pointed. He said that Ragan was bit
terly hostile to him (Kilpatrick) and
had been trying to oust him from his
position ever since Ragan had gone
Into the School Board, and he wanted
to get a hold on Ragan so as to keep
him quiet; that It would make him
(Kilpatrick) more secure In his posi
tion, and at the same time assist me
very materially In getting appointed
as a regular teacher. He unfolded his
scheme little by little on different
evenings, apparently being afraid to
state it plainly at first. His scheme
for entrapping Ragan, as he expressed
it, was as follows:
"He proposed that I should procure
$50 in greenbacks and place them in an
envelope, and with him go to the recep
tion room of Dr. Ragan's office, in the
Donohoe building; that I should, just
before going into Dr. Ragan's private
office, show the envelope and the in
closed greenbacks to him (Kilpatrick);
that I should then enter Dr. Ragan's
private office as soon as I could
be admitted, and when the oppor
tunity was offered, I should place
the envelope, v th the inclosed $50,
on the doctor's desk; that he
(Kilpatrick) would meet me imme
diately on my exit and we should to
gether immediatey go to a notary
public whom he would have ready
waiting, and I should be searched by
the notary and the envelope contain
ing the money should not be found on
my person, and that he (Kilpatrick)
and I should make full and detailed
affidavit of all the facts, so as to show
that I went into Dr. Ragan's private
office with the money and came out
without it. He explained to me that
with this affidavit we could go to Dr.
Ragan and bring him to terms: that
Ragan would be afraid of a public ex
pose, and we could coerce him. into
keeping his mouth shut; that he (Ra
gan) would not then dare to trouble
him (Kilpatrick) any further, and I
would be sure to get the position I
was seeking. When I fully compre
hended Kilpatrick's proposition I re
fused positively to have anything to do
with it, and told him that I would not
engage in such a conspiracy, and be
sides would not pay my money to any
body to secure a position in the School
Department. All this was during the
latter part of last year.
"In the latter part of January of this
year I was again teaching as a substi
tute in that school, and Kilpatrick
again opened up the subject of my ob
taining a permanent position and again
suggested that I had better follow his
advice and join with him in concocting
and executing the aforesaid scheme to
entrap and coerce Dr. Ragan. Again I
refused.
"I further depose and say that in all
conversations I had with any of the
School Directors of this city and county
in my efforts to secure an appointment
In the School Department no one of
them, and no one on their behalf, nor
on behalf of any one of them, ever in
any manner, even in the remotest de
gree, proposed or intimated to me that
I could get a position in the School De
partment if I would pay for ft.
Dr. Ragan stated last night that the
first intimation he had of any charges
being made against him in his official
capacity came to him a week ago.
â¢'Kilpatrick," said he, "is evidently
actuated by malice on account of the
stand taken by me at the time he was
on trial before the Board of Education.
Some months ago charges were pre
ferred against Kilpatrirk and referred
to the committee of which I am chair
man. I then suggested that the matter
should be heard by the whole board
Instead of by the committee. That
course was pursued and the charges
against him were dismissed. Since that
time Kilpatrick has had an idea that
I was attempting to work him out of
the department and that at the first
favorable opportunity I would secure
his dismissal. His suspicions were en
tirely unfounded
"After considerable talk over the
STORY OF THE CHIEF WITNESS.
I overheard the conversation between Teacher Stanton and Principal
E. C. Kilpatrkk. I did not sit in the office, but by accident I was within
earshot and in me name of truth, decency and cleanliness, lam glad that
I was. At the proper time I am ready to testify before the Grand Jury
as to the details.
It may be in order for me to state here as an educator that this is not the
only case in which I have had personal knowledge of the villiany of Dr. D.
F. Ragan, although, unfortunately, it is the only case in which I can give
legal evidence. Bribery and corruption such as he is guilty of daily are
hard to prove in court, no matter how well they may be known to citizens
who have anything to do with so-called "politics." It is true, however,
that the decent element of % San Francisco rose in wrath against this man.
Never, in my opinion, legally a member of the Board of Education, he has
subjugated a majority of its members to his will by cleverly working en
their own legitimate desires and ambitions, and thereby prostituting them
to his own uses. He has made the name of San Francisco a by-word and
a mockery in educational circles, not- only throughout this State, but
among her sister States. So ignorant himself that he murders English
until an audience hearing him fairly shudders, he is no more fit to have
anything to do with educational matters than is a partly educated pig.
How long, O Lord, how long!
An instance of his methods is the case in hand. His attack, through
underhand methods, upon Principal Kilpatrick is dictated by the basest
motives. Mr. Kilpatrick is an educator who is in the work for the love of
It, and who by that very token helps the hundreds of young people, year
ly under his care, in the way they most need. Ragan
has bc-mbarded him with "any .-Â©ld thing" in the way
of alleged teachers until he has been forced to turn his vigorous protests
into absolute refusal to tolerate further imposition. Because he will not
"stand in," because he refuses to become "particeps criminis," his head is
to be cut off. When Ragan sees this interview he will probably reply that
I have a sour stomach; that I applied for a position in the evening
schools, and, not getting it, seek revenge. It is true that I did so apply
on a question of merit, and very foolishly, and I was told in cold
blood that merit "cut no ice," and this man Ragan sent word to me in
the most impos-sible -to - touch way that if I would work six months
"without salary" I could have the position, and I dropped the matter in
utter disgust.
The question for the Grand Jury now seems to be, shall evil or good
dominate the schools of San Francisco? It may be difficult for them to
find evidence upon which to act, but It is not hard for the fathers and
mothers of this city to have their own way if they so- determine.
CHAUNCEY M. ST. JOHN.
The New Deputy Surveyor of Customs.
The appointment of Chauncey M. St. John to the position of Deputy-
Surveyor of Customs at the port of San Francisco has been received with
hearty approval on all sides.
Mr. St. John has long- been an active worker in the Republican party,
is one of the organizers of the naval battalion, is a director and vice-presi
dent of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, a member of the California
branch of the Sons of the American Revolution, and a man eminently fitted
for the position to which he has been appointed.
matter I learned that Stanton was the
man said to have paid me the money
for his place in the Business Evening
School. I told Director Barrington that
I would find Stanton and bring him be
fore Barrington to have him state
whether there was any truth in the
story. Barrington said that he was
satisfied from conversations had with
Kilpatrick that there was absolutely no
foundation for the charge. We then
parted.
"On Sunday afternoon I met Stanton
and asked him if he had told Kilpatrick
that he had paid for his position in the
department. He said that he had not,
and volunteered to go with me to Bar
rington. We found Barrington in his
pharmacy, on Market and Van Ness
avenue. I told Barrington that I wished
him to listen to what Stanton had to
say concerning the matter. While we
were talking, Director Carew came in.
I do not believe, however, that Carew
heard any of the statement. The story
told by Stanton is fully contained in
the affidavit sworn to by him before
Notary Turner.
Director Barrington, when seen last
night, said that Kilpatrick told him
sc-me time ago that Stanton had admit
ted to him that he had paid for his po
sition in the department. "I had sev
eral conversations with Kilpatrick,"
said he, "and I am convinced that he
is .unscrupulous and untruthful. He
repeated the story of Stanton's alleged
admission several times, and every
time there was a change in it. In some
instances the story was told differently
on immaterial facts; at other times on
facts that were very material.
Director Carew said last night that he
walked into the drug store Sunday
evening when Directors Barrington and
Ragan were talking with Stanton. He
noticed that they were quite busy at
the time and did not interrupt them.
He said that he heard none of the con
versation and left shortly afterward.
Princioal Kilpatrick was seen at the
Business Evening School last evening
and stated that while he "had not forced
the issue he was ready to go before the
Grand Jury and testify as to the state
ments made by Instructor Stanton. He
stated that he had avoided all noto
riety in the case, but had been com
pelled to defend himself against the
unjust attacks of Dr. Ragan and other
members of the Board of Education.
"This matter has been forced on me,"
he said, "and if I am called upon by
the Grand Jury I have no alternative
but to tell what I know. I am fortu
nate In having a witness to the inter
view' between myself and Stanton, in
which the latter stated that he had
agreed to pay $300 for a permanent po
sition in this school.
"That is all I can say at the present
time, but there are many other mat
ters that the Grand Jury can investi
gate with good results."
Tried to Shoot Himself.
Herman J. Pios, a despondent distiller
from Oregon, attempted suicide last even

Kearny street and asked to look at a re
volver. He ' loaaed the weapon and
snapped the trigger, pointing the barrel
at his heart. The hammer missed the
cartridge and the man was ex celled from
the store. Later he was arrested for va
grancy.

HENRY'S PECULIAR TALK.
At a Banquet the Prince Speaks Upon
the Complications of Several
Nations.
CopyriffhW lÂ«?s by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS. Feb. s.â lt is calm before the
storm. There has been an undoubted
lull in the agitation over the Dreyfus
case during the last few da.ys, but
fears are widely entertained that we
shall go from bad to worse the day
after to-morrow, when Emile Zola ap
pears before the Assize Court of the
Seine to stand his trial. Even yet noth
ing is known of the difficulty as to
whether officers summoned by Zola as
witnesses will be allowed to give evi
dence, nor has any indication leaked
out regarding the result of M. Zola's
applicationtothe Minister of Justice to
allow General Billot, Minister of War,
to appear in the witness box. The
state of popular feeling is indicated by
literature which has been issued from
the printing presses voluminously. The
output of squibs, ballads and cartoons
upon the Dreyfus case is greater than
even in the days of the Panama and
Boulanger affairs. It is a significant
fact that none of these pro-Dreyfus or
defenders of Zola suffers especially.
Prince Henry made reference to the
Dreyfus matter in a speech at a ban
quet given in his honor prior to his de
parture for Abyssinia at the Hotel Con
tinental la?t night. He said: "At a
moment when Emperor William is
sending the Deutchland to Chinese wa
ters, when the oldest of Empires is
cracking to its foundations, when In
dia is in revolt and England ready to
march on Khartoum and casts covetous
eyes on the Nile Valley, you feel there
are questions intervening in France
that dominate those of party. When
at home you see a horde of people who
in the main have cc-me from across the
Rhine, and who, because they inhabit
France, think the same hearts beat
within their breasts as in ours, and
who spew upon the most sacred insti
tutions of the country â you should un
derstand there is but one flag, and that
it is the duty of all to gather around
it."
The company at the banquet includ
ed most of the eminent Frenchmen who
have given attention to colonial ques
tions and a sprinkling of young men,
personal friends of Prince Henry, to
whom Chairman M. Miln-Edwards
pointed in disproof of the saying that
there was no more enterprise and vi
tality in France. In the course of his
speech Prince Henry outlined the plans
of Count Leontieff and himself regard
ing the equatorial provincesof Ethiopia.
Emperor Menelik had intrusted to them
the responsibility of organizing this
immense province, which would form
his buffer state â it was unnecessary to
say against whom, said the Prince,
with an obvious reference to England!
According to Gaulois, a well-known
water-color painter has received many
orders to paint flowers on silks for
dresses to be worn by leading women
of society. A fashionable contempora
ry declares that such hand-painted cos
tumes will be la mode de demain. The
cost will certainly prevent its vulgar
ization.
Parisians are to have a chance of
comparing the famous Spanish act
tress, Senora Maria Guerrero, with their
own tragedienne. Sarah Bernhardt has
arranged for her to occupy the stage
of the Renaissance, whereon Sienora
Duse recently played. Senora Guer
rero will be accompanied by her hus
band. Marquis of Fontanaar, who plays
under the name of Fernando Diaz de

GRAB ON THE SUS COAST
Troops of the Sultan of Morocco Very

a Warm Reception.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. s.â The Cavendish
expedition, which is about to leave
London, is one of the most striking
samples of how young and wealthy
Englishmen with a fondness. for sport
and exploration combine their tastes
with empire making. Henry Caven
dish, a relative of the Duke of Devon
shire, has already spent $300,000 in
preparation for the expedition. Al
though nominally private, its aims are
toward the Upper Nile, where the
French are supposed to be operating,
and are well known to high Govern
ment officials. As a matter of fact,
the route adopted was suggested by
the chiefs of the Intelligence Depart
ment of the .War Office, and the For
eign Office had the scheme under con
sideration for some weeks. The force
which will accompany Cavendish will
be better armed than any body of men
which has ever entered Africa. It will
take with it 350,000 rounds of ammu
nition and a number of seven pounder
Maxim rapid fire guns. It will be well
provided against surprises. Caven
dish expects to reach the Upper Nile
in three or four months and may con
tinue to Khartoum after the Der
vishes have been beaten.
Dr. Donaldson Smith, the American
explorer, recently telegraphed to the
Royal Geographical Society from In
dia, announcing his readiness to ex- j
plore the Upper Nile, but the society
replied that the matter had been set
tled by Mr. Cavendish going.
When the evidence is sifted it ap
pears that the Globe venture syndi
cate's descent on the Sus coast of
Morocco, announced in the dispatches
on January 31, closely resembles Dr.
Jameson's Transvaal raid. The pre
tended ignorance of Sir Edward
Thornton, chairman of the syndicate
and formerly British Embassador at
Washington, is wholly untenable, for it
is known that warnings were received
in London at Christmas to the effect
that if the Tourmaline, the vessel of
the expedition, persisted in her inten
tion to land arms and ammunition on
the Sus coast she would meet with a
warm reception by the troops and
ships of the Sultan of Morocco.
The Saturday Review protests
against "such buccaneering expedi
tions, hazarding imperial prestige for
the benefit of a band of needy adven
turers and unpicturesque freebooters."
and expresses the hope that the Sultan
will press a claim for damages for
"this flagrant breach of international
faith, even though the dignity and
pockets of ex-diplomatists suffer ac
cordingly."
The Statist says that the wheat crop
of India promises splendidly. The cut
ting will begin during the' present
month and it will be shipped at the end
of March or early in April, "thus im
mensely benefiting Europe at the time
American supplies are low." The Statist
further remarks that it is expected
Australia will be in a position to ex
port a great deal more than expected.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1898.
ENGLAND'S
BACKDOWN
UNPOPULAR
Right About Face
Policy Regarding
Talien Wan.
Whole Country Prefers
War to Seeing Rus
sia Own China.
But the Aged Queen Now De
sires to End Her Days
in Peace.
DEFICIENCY OF THE ARMY
Sir Charles Dilke Shows That Great
Britain's Land Forces Are in
a Deplorable State.
Copyrighted 189S by James Gordon Bennett.
LONDON, Feb. s.â The newspaper
event of the week was the Times' re
port of England's right-about-face in
regard to Talien Wan. It is not be
lieved here, but if it proves true it
will arouse ugly popular displeasure,
because the whole country is solid for
war rather than see China closed to
commerce or owned by Russia. If the
Times' story is the true reason it must
be the desire of the aged Queen to end
her days without war. The English
press to-day, between the lines of its
editorials, warns the sovereign that de
spite loyalty, even monarchs are apt
to be forgotten when the nation is
angered.
Foreign military officers have long
been saying that the British army is
largely a paper force, and that it is
falling into a perilous condition. It re
mained for Sir Charles Dilke to be the
first to tell the English the same thing
with facts to prove it. This he has
done in a series of articles in the whole
of this week's issue of the Daily Mail,
entitled, "Why we need an army." He
says that although the British policy
is a defensive one, yet when war comes
it will have to be aggressive. He scoffs
at an alliance, and says that no Brit
ish government will bind the country
to one of the "great combinations in
time of peace, and as to arbitration,
he argues that by means of it other
powers might squeeze the vital inter
ests out of England under the present
forms instead of a by a downright
threat.
"It is probable," Sir Charles says,
"that in any general European war
in which we might engage against a
combination the United States will be
neutral and will free us from too close
attention to the defense of Canada.
This might tend to produce a feeling
less favorable to peace than the exist
ing condition of affairs. It is certain
that no British government will pro
pose to keep a large force in Canada
in time of peace, while to send one
there in time of war would be more a
question of command of the sea than
an army question."
lie sums up the situation by saying:
"No one who knows the true condi
tion of the home army and militia and
volunteers can Imagine that we pos
sess an army fit at sudden call for any
of the duties I have described. The
British public has never before been
told the truth, and such are the ridicul
ous conditions that recruiting has
grown difficult. Minimum height and
chest measurements have been reduced
and a large number of boys have been
admitted, and recruits who die like
flies, if sent to India or the tropics, or
even to the Mediterranean, under 20,
have been sent in increasing numbers.
Swiss militiamen can march with their
heavy packs as well as the French two
and-a-half-year men or German two
year soldiers, but our men for years
never marched in such marching
order."
He says there is no resemblance
whatever between England's reserve
and the reserve of other powers in the
world. As for cavalry regiments, he
says the time which would be con
sumed in making the cavalry fit for
the field out of the present skeleton
regiments, is incredible.
As for the artillery, its condition is
absolutely disgraceful, the last year
three batteries sent to South Africa be
ing chosen as in the highest state of
preparation for war. They should have
required twenty-seven men to complete
them, but they actually required 189
men to do so. Horses were taken from
twenty other batteries, whose efficiency
was thus destroyed. The home cavalry
would require nearly 10,000 horses. It
possesses only 3600. The militia is
paper force; there are 14,000 men ab
sent, and 641 officers lacking.
As regards the army and the militia
there is no provision for waste in war.
There is nothing behind the front line,
for the army reserves and the militia
reserves are both counted in that line
by the authorities.
ARE YET AFTER
SENATOR LINDSAY.
The Kentucky Legislature Continues
to Desire the Statesman's
Resignation.
CINCINNATI, Feb. 5.â A special to the
Commercial-Tribune from Frankfort,
Ky., says: A majority of the House sig
nified its Intention to-day to continue its
appeal to Senator Lindsay to resign. The
Senator's response to the legislative re
quest for his resignation, delivered in the
Senate at Washington yesterday, waa
read with interest by member* of both
houses. Mr. Meyers, Republican, of
Greenup, in the morning preliminaries of
the House, said that body had suspended
proceedings last week to have read a
newspaper article attacking Senator
Lindsay, and, in view of this, he now
moved that Senator Lindsay's response
to the request for his resignation should
be made part of the Journal. There were
cries of "No" from the Democratic side,
and Speaker Brannan ruled the motion
out of order.

miles in the country to-night is to the
that he is thought to be dying.

at Work.

Rebels, but Details Are
Suppressed.

Ambition to Remain in Power Is the
Cause of the Uprising Against
Iglesias.
Copyrighted IS9S by James Gordon Bennett.
PANAMA, Feb. s.â The enemies of
Costa Rica and Nicaragua have chosen
the same time to strike forcible blows
at the existing governments. Both
countries are in open revolt, and the
information so far received shows that
the movements are serirnis.
Few details of the uprising in Costa
Rica have reached here, owing to the
strict censorship immediately estab
lished. It is known, however, that se
rious troubles have taken place in San
Jose, and the Government ia actively
preparing for radical steps to subdue?
the revolutionary movement. In Nica
ragua the movement seems to be mo-re
widespread. News just received is that
outbreaks occurred simultaneously in
San Juan del Sur, at the western end
of the Nicaragua Canal; Matagalpa, a
city in the interior, and the extreme
northwestern provinces of Leon and
Chinandega.
San Juan is now in the hands of the
rebels, and active operations are under
way. The full extent of these opera
tions bo far is not 'known.
News of revolt in Nicaragua received
so far came in secret dispatches to sev
eral prominent Nicaragua exiles now in
Panama. This information is confirmed
by the fact that a cable censorship has
been established. This censorship has
cut off all direct communication with
Managua and Costa Rica. Great dis
content has prevailed in Costa Rica
since November last, when President
Iglesias caused himself to be re-elected
for a second term, previously changing
the constitution, which expressly stated
that no President could serve more
than one term. His second term com
mences on May 1, if he is not over
thrown by force of arms before that
date. In "the election he was opposed
by Dr. Juaa Floies and Zenon Castro,
candidates of the Republican party.
Before the election both were exiled.
Dr. Flcrcs is now pupposed to be in
New Orleans or New York, and sfnor
Castro is in Salvador, presuming they
have not secretly returned to Costa
Rica and are at the head of the move
ment there.
The economical conditions in Costa
Rica are also bad,, due to the low price
of coffee and the high rate of ex
change. The situation there now is
analogous to that in Guatemala before
the uprisffig in September last against
President Barrios. Ambition to remain
in power is, as I said in a dispatch to
the Herald when Senor Iglesias was re
elected, the cause of the present up
heaval.
PLENTY OF REBELLION
IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
The Navy Department Will Lose No
Time in Sending Cruisers to Pro-
tect Uncle Sam's Subjects.
NEW YORK, Feb. 6.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: With a
revolution officially reported in Costa
Rica, another in Nicaragua and rebel
lion impending in Salvador, Central
America is in a ferment.
Minister Merry, in San Jose, the cap
ital of Costa Rica, cabled to the State
Department to-day that "Revolution
was inaugurated here yesterday." Up
to a late hour to-night nothing official
has been received, so far as can be
learned, regarding the revolution in
Nicaragua.
Advices received by the State Depart
ment several â weeks ago from Consul
Jenkins, in Salvador, announced that
"revolution is impending." Mr. Jen
kins has supplemented this by dis
patches Showing the necessity for the
presence of a man-of-war at La Lib
ertad. The gunboat Marietta was or
dered to proceed to that port. She left
Acapulco, Mexico, on February 8, and
is expected to reach her destination to
morrow.
No orders were issued by the Navy
Department to-day to any men-of-war
to proceed to Costa Rica. The cruiser
Alert Is at San Juan del Sur, and
should the revolt at that place not
prove to be of a serious character she
will probably go to Costa Rica. The
gunboat Newport is on the eastern side
of Nicaragua, at Greytown, and will af
ford protection to American interests.
Minister Calvo, the representative of
Costa Rica here, does not believe the
report that a revolution has occurred
in Costa Rica. Senor Corea, Charge
d'Affairea of the Greater Republic of
Central America, told me to-night that
he was without advices respecting the
report that a revolution has broken out
in Nicaragua. In well-informed Pan-
American circles the report is believed,
as it has been known for some time
that a strong party was forming in
Nicaragua antagonistic to President
Zelaya, and determined to accomplish
his downfall.
In view of the fact that President
Guitterez of Salvador has his hands
full In coping with the situation in his
country, it is not expected he can lend
any support to President Zelaya, as he
did some months ago when he aided
that official in suppressing the revolt
then directed against his administra
tion.

PORT AU PRINCE, Haytl. Feh. 5.â
Reports persistently circulated and ap
parently well founded that Italian war
ships are coming to Haytl to enforce the
payment of an indemnity claim cause
much anxiety here. I am advised to-day
that Italian men-of-war are now at St.
Thomas coaling. It is expected they will
drop anchor In this port within a few

United States Minister, to-day present
ed an official note to the Spanish Gov
ernment, to which Premier Sagasta re
sponded in vigorous terms.
The work on the naval armament is
being actively rushed, and the Spanish

Canary Islands.
GENERAL BLANCO'S
EFFORTS ARE IN VAIN.
Proceeds to Puerto Principe and
Attempts ,to Induce Some In
surgent Chief to Surrender.
Copyrighted IS9B by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Feb. s.â General Blanco
broke his return Journey to Neuvitas
in order to proceed to Puerto Principe
and make a last effort to induce some
rebel chief of importance to surrender.
The latest advices do not show that he
has met with any success so far. A
special steamer remains at Neuvitas
awaiting General Blanco, who is lpoked
for in Havana any day.
Spanish merchants here oppose the
new government in its attempt to car
ry into effect a commercial treaty with
the United States. Hitherto the pro
hibitive duty has practically kept out
American goods, and Spanish mer
chants enjoyed a monopoly. They are
now using every effort to prevent the
treaty being signed. As an example
of the way American goods are kept
out I may mention a case that oc
curred a few days ago when an Amer
ican firm was compelled to pay a duty
of $700 on 200 dozen chickens, and the
remainder of a live cargo in propor
tion.
General Lee is much aggrieved over
Secretary Sherman's action in handing
contributions for ihe relief of the poor
in Cuba to Minister de Lome, who for
wards the amount direct to the Span
ish authorities here. Through this ac
tion an attempt is being made here to
discredit General Lee.
Among the passengers who arrived
here to-day on board the Spanish
steamer Maria Cristina were Senor
Eduardo Dolz, Secretary of Posts and
Telegraphs in the Colonial Cabinet;
Senator Elizo Giberga and thirty offi
cers and 1450 soldiers. The Secretary
and Senator were received by the cen
tral and other committees of the au
tonomist party, who went out on a
tug. The new arrivals were cheered
by crowds on the wharves.
Captain George A. Converse of the
United States cruiser Montgomery, ac
companied by Lieutenant Ramsey and
United States Consul Brice, visited the
Governor of Matanzas yesterday, and
to-day the Governor, his secretary and
other authorities of Matanzas returned
the visit of the American officers.
As told in previous dispatches. Gen
eral Lee on Sunday last gave a break
fast to the officers of the Maine. The
breakfast was given in the rooms of
the Havana Yacht Club at Plaza de
Mariano, a suburb of Havana. It
seems the insurgents heard of this af
fair, and a band arranged a demon
stration, the purpose being to fmpress
the navy officers with the proximity
of insurgent forces to Havana. Gen
eral Lee's party broke up earlier than
was expected to attend a bull fight. It
hardly disappeared before there were
raiders firing shots about the club
house. The rebels were quickly dis
persed by a detachment of Spanish
soldiers under command of Major
Tapia Ruano.
DEATH HAS CLAIMED
MONSIGNOR M'COLGAN.
BALTIMORE, Feb. s.â Monsignor Ed
ward McColgan, by virtue of his title an
honorary member of the pontifical house
hold, vicar-general of the archdiocese of
Baltimore and for more than half a cen
tury pastor of St. Peter's Catholic
Church, died at 9:13 o'clock this morning
at the parish residence, adjoining the
church. Ho was aged 86 years 9 months
and a few days.

REFORMS NOT TO BE MADE
Turkey Will Never Adopt Practical
Measures and All Europe
Cannot Compel Her.
Copyright. IS9B. by James Gordon Bennett.
NEW YORK, Feb. s.â The Herald's
mission to Armenia has been complet
ed, and Dr. Hepworth's last letters
from Asiatic Turkey will be printed in
the Herald to-morrow. They possess
an extraordinary interest, summariz
ing, as they do, the results of a most
thorough investigation of the question
which has so long been agitating the
civilized world. The most important of
the letters is dated "On board the Cle
opatra, bound for Constantinople, Jan.
9, 1598," and in it Dr. Hepworth says:
"The Armenian massacres were
caused by Armenian revolutionists, and
if these revolutionists had kept quiet
there would never have been any mas
sacres. That is true beyond the possi
bility of denial. These rogues, a few
miserable hundred of them, have caused
all the trouble, while they themselves
have escaped from the donsequences of
their guilt. They would have been com
paratively powerless, though, but for
the expressed or tacit sympathy of
England and Russia. England has in
spired them with the notion that they
are patriotic heroes, and they have
traded on that fact and made their liv
ing out of it. They steal their way into
villages, stir the inhabitants with the
hope of autonomy, declaring that all
they have to do is to place themselves
in open revolt, and then the great pow
ers will rush to their aid and make
them into a sort of Bulgaria. England
is undoubtedly responsible for a great
deal that has taken place, encouraging
these refugees and inciting them to do
work which has already involved their
countrymen in almost irretrievable
ruin.
"If there were any chance of Arme
nian success the game would be well
worth the candle, and the object in
view quite worth the spcrifi.ee neces
sary to accomplish it. \\ r e Americans
know that freedom is worth any price
which circumstances demand, but
England is perfectly well aware that it
would be far easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for
Armenians to achieve autonomy, and
her sympathy with the professional
revolutionists is simply criminal. As
for Russia, she guards her frontier
with sedulous care, except when an
Armenian with a box of guns wishes
to cross, and then she shuts her eyes
and lets him go. He will play into her
hands, without doubt, for disturbed
and embarrassed Turkey may afford
her the opportunity which she has long
been seeking.
"The most threatening spot in Ana
tolia is the region of Van. It is within
a few hours of the Persian frontier,
and is positively invested with these
troublesome mischief makers. They
cross the border, preach revolt to Ar
meniansâto those who will listen, at
least â and then go back to a place of
safety. Van is, therefore, at once the
hardest vilayet in Asia Minor to gov
ern, and. a serious menace to continued
peace. In a word, it is a prophecy of
bad times to come. Imprison these few
hundred revolutionists and there would
be no fear of the future. Of course
Turkey is ,not blind to this fact, but
she prefers to pursue the barbarous
policy of wholesale murder, with the
hope of exterminating the ra.ee. The
truth is, Turkey is easily thrown into
a fright, and she imagines things to
be a thousand times worse than they
are. She can only claim charitable
judgment on the ground that she has
been panic stricken, and during a pe
riod of mental aberration has done
deed 9 which have made the world won
der.
"Another fact with regarfl to the
present condition of Turkey has been
forced upon me, namely, that a coun
try which never builds roads has no
commercial future and will suffer in
the sharp competition for the world's
trade. Moreover, it is clear to me that
Turkey will never organize practical
reforms. Not all the powers of Europe
can force them on her. She doesn't
know how to reform, is quite content
to remain as she Is and hates all in
novations, even In the shape of im
provements."

BERLIN, Feb. s.â The Relch
sanzeiger this evening publishes
the text of an imperial ordinance
dated to-day and worded as fol
lows: "In order to prevent the
introduction of the San Jose
shield louse, the importation of
living plants and fresh plant re
fuse from America, also barrels
and boxes and other objects used
in the packing or keeping there
of is prohibited until further no
tice.
"The same prohibition applies
to the dispatch of fresh fruit and
fresh fruit* refuse, whenever the
examination made at a place of
entry may establish the presence
of the San Jose louse. This pro
hibition does not apply in any
way to the goods which enter by
ships and remain on the ships.
The imperial Chancellor is em
powered to grant exceptions and
to take the necessary precau
tionary measures."
BERLIN. Feb. s.â The freedom
which the Reichstag and the Prussian
Diet conceded this week to the agra
rians, who formulated numerous
wishes and complaints, is significant.
The Minister of Agriculture, Baron yon
Hammerstein-Loxten, promised for the
Government that he would grant as
many of their demands as possible. At
the moment he was making this decla
ration measures were preparing to
stop the importation of American
fruit and the decree in that connection
had already teen issued. The entire
Liberal press openly disapproves of
the policy and assert it was a Govern
ment trick to obtain the vote of the
Agrarians for Emperor William's na
val bill.
The leading commercial journals
point to the ill will and indignation
such measures are bound to produce in
America and to the futility of prohib
iting the importation of an article Ger
many does not produce with suffi
ciency. The newspapers claim the
only result will be that fruit will be
Imported from the south of Europe at
a higher cost than is now being paid
for American fruits.
Dr. Friedrich yon Kueger of the
Agricultural High School, upon whose
report the authorities here are under
stood to have acted, has been making
an extensive series of experiments and
examinations of the American plants
and fruits supposed to be infected by
the San Jose bug. After many failures
he finally discovered the bug in three
specimens of peaches and pears.-
Dr. Heinrich Dorhru, president of the
Entomological Society oÂ£ Stettin,
writes that the San Jose bug has long
been known in Germany as the blut
laus aijd has devastated orchards in
various parts of the country, especial
ly in the neighborhood of Frankfort
and Stettin. He adds: "The present
scare is as unjustified as the late Colo
rado bug scare."
The United States embassy is continu
ing its remonstrances as a protest
against the unfounded rumors alleging
that it if* weakening.
Several of the newspapers express
the opinion that the decree will not be
permanent and that it was only inted
ed as a temporary act of retaliation for
American treatment of German sugar.
Inquiry made at the Foreign Office and
at the Prussian Agricultural Depart
ment, however, shows the steps taken
to be only forerunners of others of
more importance, the Government hav
ing concluded that something must be
done to gratify the Agrarian demand
for retaliation on the United States.
There was an exemplification in the
Reichstag on Tuesday when Dr. Hahn,
a friend of Prince Bismarck, demanded
the prohibition of American horses,
claiming the imports had increased in
1897 to 4,279,000 marks, and that some
thing must be done "to show those
overbearing Americans that an ener
getic German Government exists." The
views of the Prussian Cabinet are
gaugeable by a declaration made by
the Minister of Agriculture, Baron yon
Hammerstein-Loxten, in the Diet, who
declared that American horses devel
oped influenza after importation, add- !
ing: "If the importations Increase we j
shall certainly be forced to adopt a ,
suitable quarantine in order to pro- !
tect ourselves."
The total exclusion of all living cat- j
tie and hogs is also under considera
tion.
The sugar producers have petitioned
the Imperial Chancellor demanding i
that no tariff agreement shall be ac- j
cepted unless the United States tariff
on German sugar is reduced 20 per
cent from the present scale and an as
surance given that no other country
â will be more favorably treated.
The Prussian Cabinet has adopted
* Emperor William's plan to remove the
Berlin University, Royal Library and
other scientific institutions which are
now In the center of the city, to Char
lottenburg. The buildings vacated will
become the residences of royalties, and
the Government offices will be central
ized. The plan is bound to arouse
great opposition when published.
I The present year's imperial army
maneuvers will be between the army
corps of the Reichsland and Wurtem
berg, but they will not be as extensive
as those of 1897. Probably no more
than 50,000 troops will be engaged.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Feb. s.â The officers are
now hot on the trail of Indian Dick,
the outlawed murderer, and it is ex
pected that he will be hunted down and
taken either dead or alive in a few
days. The desperate redskin has taken
t'-> the swamps and is well equipped
with arms and ammunition, and it is
believed that unless he should be taken
by surprise, which is not likely, he will
make a desperate fight for his life.
Dick has been hunted by a number of
officers. Constable Ben Dennis of
Letcher having taken an active part in
the pursuit of the redskin. " He has
managed to thus far elude all his pur
suers*. or, when come upon, has always
made a hard fight until an opportunity
was afforded to escape, when he has
taken to the swamps, whither his pur
suers could not follow him.
Word has just reached this city that
Constable English and Deputy Sheriff
Hafley had a running gun fight with
the Indian last Tuesday evening in the
swamps above Centerville, this county.
A large number of shots were ex
changed, the outlaw escaping the fire
of his pursuers and finally again mak
ing good his escape by taking to the
swamps, his old shelter. None of the
numerous shots in the fusillade took
effect, as the firing was done at long
range. Dick kept retreating as rapidly
as he could and kept up the shooting,
while the two officers closed upon him,
notwithstanding the bullets that were
sent whizzing at them. When the fu
sillade of the officers became too hot
for him, the daring Indian made a dash
into the dense underbrush that abounds
in the swamp and succeeded in suc
cessfully running the gauntlet.
Constable English and Officer Hafley
learned a few days previously where
the outlaw was camped with four other
Indians, and, together with several cit
izens, started for the scene.' Several
of the volunteers lost their courage as
they approached the outlaw's supposed
abode and turned back. The officer
also returned for more help, and when
he again reached the vicinity of the
camp only four peaceable Indians could
be seen there, Dick having doubtless
obtained a warning that his where
abouts was known and fled. Since
that time English, together with Dep
uty Sheriff Hafley, have been hot on
the trail of the desperado and as soon
as they caught sight of him they
opened fire.
Dick is thoroughly at home in the
swamps and the hills, knowing every
nook and place difficult of access, and
hence the officers are at a great dis
advantage in the pursuit. Dick will
shoot down his pursuers if he ever gets
a drop on them, as he has shown him
self to be a criminal of the most cold
blooded stripe. Constable English re
turned from the hunt, but Hafley is
still searching the hills. Governor
Budd has offered a reward of $400 for
the arrest and conviction of the put
law.
Dick escaped from the chain gang
about two months ago and one of his
first acts was to brain one of his own
race, a young Indian named Tyner
Bill. Since that he has made himself
the terror of the foothill region, which
is sparsely settled. He has been a
terror to the women, and no dweller of
that vicinity dares to leave his wife or
daughter alone. Dick is relentlessly
hunted by two negroes and two In- j
dians, whose wives he wronged. They i
declare that they will shoot him on !
sight. Dick intimidates most of the
Indians, making them shield him and
supply him with food.
DEFECTS NOT
DUE TO SOIL
Experts Report on the Dry
dock at the Brooklyn
Yard.
i Special DlSDatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. s.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs: To
convince Congress that the defects in
dry dock No. 3 at the Brooklyn navy
yard are not due to soil, Secretary Long
has forwarded to Representative Hil
born, senior member of the House Naval
Committee, views of expert officers on
the subject. "Walsh Bros., who built the
dock, assert, it is alleged, that the
structure was constructed in a substan
tial manner, but that the quicksand char
acter of the soil caused the development
of defects. The defense of Civil Engineer
A. G. Menocal is expected to raise a
efmilar issue. Naval Constructor Bowles,
who is superintending the repairs to the
drydock, and Civil Engineer M. T. Endi
cott, assistant to the Chief of the Bureau
of Yards and Docks, were ordered to
make an investigation. Their letters have
been forwarded to Hilborn. .
Hilborn told me to-night the officers
had agreed that the navy-yard soil is
fully capable of resisting the pressure
from the weight of the three docks now
in the yard. Secretary Long may send
civilian experts to Brooklyn to lnvesti
gate the condition of the soil. I saw Rep
resentative Hilborn to-night and he said:
"The statements made by Naval Con
structor Bowles and Civil Engineer Endi
cott coincide with my opinion. Represen
tatives of floating drydock schemes with
whom I have talked, however, assert that
the defects developed in drydock No. 3
were due to the character of the soil.
If it should be shown that the soil Is re
sponsible for causing the defects then it
would be throwing money away to con
tinue to repair dock No. 8.
"I do not believe that the Brooklyn
navy-yard is an ideal site for docks, but
that we can build a dock there and main
tain it is proved by the fact that we have
one wooden and one granite dock that
have done good service. Drydock No. 3
accommodated the battle-ship Massa
chusetts satisfactorily. Its bottom was
able to stand the weight. The defects
which have devfloped have appeared at
the entrance of the dock and have no
reference, it is my opinion, to the char
acter of the soil."

Washington, Feb. 5.
The House to-day, during its entire
session, had under consideration the
! bill making appropriations for fortifi
i cations and coast defenses. Little in
; terest seemed to be manifested in the
proceedings, less than one-half of the
: members being present during the ses
| sion. The bill was passed by the
I House, carrying $4,144,912, as against
: $9,517,141 for last year,
i At the opening of the session of the
I House Royce (K.j of Indiana, chairman
j of the Committee on Elections No. 2, pre
i sented a resolution declaring that in the
j contest between Samuel Hudson and Wil
i Ham McAleer of Pennsylvania, for a seat
i in the House. McAleer is entitled to the
| seat. "Without division the resolution
i and report of the committee was
! adopted.
A bill granting to the Gulf, Colorado
' and Santa Fe Railroad Company the right
| to construct a branch of its road in the
| Indian Territory was passed.
A bill authorizing the Muskogee Coal
â¢ and Railway Company to construct and
I operate a railroad through the Indian
j Territory and Oklahoma Territory was
I also passed.
The House then went into committee of
the whole and resumed consideration of
the fortifications appropriation bill.
MoClellan (D.) of New York in a speech
declared that the bill carried no adequate
appropriation for the defense of New
I York harbor, and said the trouble was
[ that too much money was expended for
| the improvement of our harbors, which
i would make them accessible to a hostile
fleet. "It would be much better," said
' he, "first to protect our harbors, and
| then, after they are protected, to im
! prove them."
In response Bayers (D.) of Texas, a
1 member of the Appropriations Commit-
I tee, expressed the opinion that there was
I not the slightest prospect of war with
! any foreign nation. "Economy," said he,
"ought to be the watchword on both
sides of this Chamber, and no appropria
: tion for any project oupht to be made
unless it is absolutely necessary."
After discussing the work of the Ap
i proprlations Committee in consideration
j of the various appropriation bills, Sayers
; said: "Our revenues are large enough. It
j ought to be our effort to reduce the cx
i penses of the Government in order that
they may conform to the receipts. We
ought to unite to make this Congress one
of the most economical since the Civil
I War."
By the introduction of an amendment
to reduce the maximum price of oil
tempered and annealed steel from 23 to
22 cents per pound McÃae of Arkansas
secured the floor and made a sharp at
tack upon the administration. He said
he had no fear of war, because he was
satisfied the present administration would
accept any insult from a foreign nation
that might be offered; bound hand and
foot, as it was, by trusts and monopolies.
The great mass of the people, however,
would protect the honor of the country.
Instead of preparing for war, to protect
the country from the inroads of a foreign
nation, McÃae thought Congress ought to
protect the country from a further issue
of bonds, which seemed likely, in view of
the present condition of the revenues, be
fore the end of the year.
Foot (R.) of New York and Mahon (R.)
of Pennsylvania opposed the amendment,
maintaining that the adoption would re
sult precisely as had the effort of Con
gress to reduce the price of armor plate,
and that it was likely to cause one year's
delay in the manufacture of guns. The
amendment was defeated, 56 to 34.
Lewis (D.) of Washington obtained the
floor to conclude the remarks he had be
gun earlier in the day. He maintained
that the treasury had now only $124,000,000
with which to pay a two-billion dollar
debtâ a debt that was constantly increas
ing. He held that the Government was
now paying a 200-cont dollar in liquidation
of its obligationsâ obligations that when
contracted were worth only 50 cents on
the present dollar.
After another fruitless effort on the
part of McClellan to amend the bill, the
rending of the measure was concluded,
reported by the committee of the whole
to the House and passed.
At 3:10 p. m. the House adjourned until
Monday. ________________

Call Office, Riggs House,

Governor Hoadly was in consulta
tion with the Attorney General to-day
upon the subject of foreclosures against
the Kansas Pacific Railroad. It has
been decided by the Department of Jus-
tice that the Government will exercise
the power conferred upon the President
by the act of 1887 and redeem the claims
of the first mortgage bondholders upon
the eastern and middle divisions, re
spectively, and become surrogated un
der the law to their rights. This will
make the Government the owner of
both the first and second liens upon
these divisions of the road.
An application will be made to Judge
Sanborn at St. Louis next Saturday for
leave to redeem, for a postponement of
the sales of the road, which are now
advertised to take place on February
16, 17 and 18, and for the appointment
of a receiver in the Government suit to
operate the railroad for the benefit of
its liens. The present receivers are op
erating the road under the suit of the
third mortgage bondholders, commonly
called the consolidated mortgage. By
this means it is expected that the im
mediate sale of the property will be de
ferred, and that the Government will
have more opportunity to negotiate for
a better price than has been offered by
the reorganization committee, which
now controls the first mortgages, and
in the meantime the benefits of the
profitable operation of the road, if it
continues to be profitably managed
will, under the receiver appointed in
the Government suit, be to the advan
tage of the Government by way of re
duction of its claim.
Notices of the application to be made
next Saturday have been served by tel
egraph on the reorganization commit
tee and upon the counsel of the re
spective underlying mortgages. Am
ple authority for this action on the
part of the Government is conferred
by the act of March 3, 1887, which pro
vides that whenever in the opinion of
the President it shall be deemed neces
sary to the protection of the Govern
ment's interest in any of the bond
aided roads the Secretary of the Treas
ury is required to redeem or otherwise
clear off the paramount lien or mort
gage by paying the sums lawfully due
out of the treasury.
The amount which will be necessary
to pay the first iienholders in this case
is something over $8,000,000, the same
amount which the Government would
have been compelled to pay them had
it acquired title under the pending
sale. The situation of the Govern-
ment Is regarded by Attorney-General
Gripers, who advised the present
course, and other leading officials, as
greatly improved thereby, and It is
now expected that Judge Sanborn, un
der the circumstances, will willingly
consent to a postponement of the sale
for an Indefinite period, or at least
to a date sufficiently remote to allow
the Government ample time In which
to dispose of its interest to the best
advantage.

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 5.
A recount of the Treasury cash which
was completed late this afternoon, dis
closed a shortage of $859. The recount,
made necessary by the appointment in
June last of Ellis H. Roberts as United
States treasurer in place of D. N. Mor
gan, was begun on July 1 and since that
time about $797,000,000 in cash has been
counted. No errors nor shortage of Im
portance were discovered until the treas
ury committee had begun work in silver
vault No. 1, in which there were 103 653 000
standard dollars.
A colored man named Martin, employed
as a laborer, was one clay discovered in
the coal and wood basement under sus
picious circumstances and a search re
sulted in the finding of a number of silver
dollars which presumably he had ab
stracted from some of the bags. Martin
was arrested and made a confession ad
mitting he had taken $28, for which he
had substituted lead. The court imposed
a fine of $50. and Martin was released
This admission cast suspicion upon the
entire contents of the vault and a count
by handling each Individual piece waa
ordered. On September 10 twenty-eight
expert counters and a force of laborers
and verifiers, under the direction of G C
Bance, assistant cashier, began the work
of counting the contents of this vault
The time employed, therefore, was nearly
five months, the counters working eight
hours each day. The shortage of $859
will be made good by Mr. Morgan the re
tiring Treasurer. It is probable, how
ever, as has been done in similar cases,
that Congress will make an appropriation
In Mr. Morgan's favor covering the
amount.

EDUCATION IN
THE COLONIES
Professor Brown on the
History of Secondary
Schools.
Franklin's Influence Upon the
Early Academy Move
ment.
The District System Declared the
Bane of Education In the
West.
Professor Elmer E. Brown addressed
a teachers' class at the University of
California yesterday morning on "The
Development of Secondary Education
In America." Professor Brown gave in
some detail the history of the academy
period in the history of education in
America. In substance he said:
The academy movement, which began with
Franklin's institution and reached Its height
at the end of a generation or two after the
Revolution, marks a transition from the early
corporation schools to the modern public
school system. In 1749 Franklin published his
proposal tor the establishment .of an academy.
Franklin, who was not profoundly impressed
with the importance of a classical education,
aimed to furnish a good Knglish education.
In fact if it had not been lor the general
prejudice in favor of education in the classics
at that time, it is probable that classical edu
cation would not have been provided for at all
In Franklins institution. Th.i school was not
opened until January, 1751. The city of Phila
delphia assisted financially in the establish
ment of the school. Franklin. In interesting
the members of the city council, urged the es
tablishment of the school in order to secure
for the youths of Pennsylvania a means of
education at home, to prepare them for the
magistracies of the commonwealth, and to pre
pare schoolmasters. The thrifty suggestion was
made that the school would bring to Philadel
phia many people, much to the financial inter
est of Pennsylvania.
In Franklin's school we find a suggestion of
the division into departments of modern
schools. Franklin's institution comprised the
Latin school, the English school and the math
ematical school. The making of a mathemati
cal school showed a broadening in the idea of
education. In fact, the two characteristics of
the academy were the broadening of the cur
riculum and the direct preparation It gave for
the ministry. Later the philosophical school
was organized.
The College of Philadelphia was suspected
.during the Revolution of disloyalty. Believing
It to be a Tory school, â¢ the Legislature took
away its charter. In its place the f'niversity
of Pennsylvania was established. Later the
college was re-established and combined with
the university. This was the beginning of the
present University of Education. â¢
The Phillips Academy of Andover received
Its charter in 17S0. Academies were also estab
lished in Maryland and Virginia during the
Revolution. The Clinton Academy, established
In 1754, on Long Island, was the first of the
New York academies. Other academies were
established in the other States about the same
time.
The University of New York, one, of the
most important educational institutions in this
country, was established in 1757. It Is espe
cially Interesting as showing the effect of
French influence upon American schools. in
Its organization can be detected the ideas of
the French statesmen of the time of the Revo
lution. The university, which does not exist
in one particular locality, but embraces the
colleges and academies all over the State, was
one of the first Instances of an attempt to se
cure a complete State educational system.
In an interesting digression upon the
school district system Professor Brown
declared that it has had an evil in
fluence upon education in the western
part of the United States.
"The district system," h* declared,
"which was burrowed from New Eng
land, has been the bane of education in
the West. New England broke away
from it long ago. but the borrowers
clung tenaciously to it. Indiana, which
recently did away with the system,
adopted the town system, which is
much better than the old district sys
tem."
T. L. Heaton, continuing his criti
cism upon reading as taught in the
public schools said, among other
things:
Knowledge of the thought does not Insure
good reading. We h.-^r this statement re
peated again and again, at te;;rh~iV institutes
and conventions, but It is a fallacy. Many a
â writer, who certainly knows the thotiKht" in
Ills writings, fails utterly in the attempt to
read or speak them. The idea, that children
ehoull be encouraged to read "naturally" is er
roneous. It is Just as Incorrect as it would be
for an officer to tell a raw and awkward re
cruit to stand or walk "naturally. " children
trying to read "naturally" almost Invariably
raise the pitch of the voice, an.} their voice's
in consequence often badly injured.
GRIFFO'S MANAGER
SKIPPED OUT
The Pugilist Has Given Up
Hope of Seeing Olympic
Club Coin.
All About Coursing, Pigeon Shooting
and Basket Ball
Games.
Young Griffo, the Australian pugilist,
â¢who was defeated by McConnell last
Thursday night at the Olympic Club, is
now looking for his manager, O'Hal
loran.
It appears that the manager drew
flown the short end of the purse "hung
up by the Olympic Club and skipped
out. At any rate, Griffo would be
pleased to see his manager. His friends
have stated that if O'Halloran refuses
to pony up on sight Griffo may not
hesitate to hold a face warming â or, in
other words, he will give O'Halloran a
good fisting. The last $10 piece Griffo
possessed went over the bar of a
friend who has been keeping the Aus
tralian in liquid refreshments.
It is said that "Cocker" Tweedie
his manager departed yesterday on the
Australian steamer with "Tut" Ryan,
the fighter who was stopped by Lan-
Bing. If Tweedie had not skipped in
such j- mysterious manner he migiit
have been afforded a second opportu
nity with some of the light weights to
Bhow what he is really capable of do

The basket ball tournament is now
well under way, and the contests are
very exciting. The game played last
Thursday evening at the gymnasium
of the T. M. C. A. of thia city was not
only the closest one so far but it was
also the most remarkable seen for a
long time. The teams were the Incog
nitos of Oakland and the Rushers of
San Francisco. The line-up was as
follows:
Incogs. Position. Rushers.
H. Lansten Left field F. L. Shaw
K. A. Keiy Right field... .W. H. Mitchell
E. Sisson Center E. Fleischer
K. C. Brown Left guard D. Hanrahan
C. F. Dunsmoor... Right guard C. Johnson
During the first half it all went the
way the Incogs desired it, Lansten
scoring eight points on very fine goals
and Brown adding two points more.
The Rushers secured only two points,
made by F. L. Shaw. It looked blue
for the red Rushers when time was
called for the first twenty minutes, and
although they pulled up wonderfully,
when they came out for the second
half it was not until one minute before
the end of the game that the score read
IS to 12 in favor of the Rushers, and
remained thus when the referee gave
his final decision. The audience went
wild over the hard won victory of the
local players.
The score of the teams now is as fol
lows:
Won. Lost.

DEATH OF MAJOR STONEHILL.
The death of Major Edward B. Stonehill, ex-District Attorney of this city,
was announced at an early hour yesterday morning. His death was sudden,
and was unexpected by the members of his family, as he had not complained
of any illness previous to his retiring the night before, but, on the contrary,
was in the enjoyment of the best of spirits. His death is supposed to have
been caused by apoplexy. Few men, for the years that Major Stonehill had re
sided in San Francisco, had more warm personal friends than he.. He was
warm-hearted and jovial, and always had a pleasant greeting for his friends.
Edward B. Stonehill was born in Germany on January 21, 1829, and was
consequently in his 69th year. He learned the cigar business, but left home
before he had turned his trade to any profit, and landed in the United
States when a mere boy. At the breaking out of the war with Mexico he
joined the United States army, and served through the entire war in the
same regiment as the late Chief Scannell. After the close of the Mexican
war he returned to his home in the East, where he remained until 1852, when
he came to California, but did not remain long in this State. He went to Ne
vada, where he followed the business of trading and mining until 1859. While
a resident of Nevada he attached himself to the Nevada County Rifles and
fought with that company against the Piute Indians, who made war on the
Nevadans. The breaking out of the civil war in 1861 took him South, where
he joined the Confederate ranks and served on the staff of General Arm
strong and also on the staff of Joe Selby, and took part in the great battle
of Shiloh.
On the close of the war he returned to New York, but again came to Cali
fornia in 1868, and once more went to Nevada, where he entered the law office
of Garber & Thornton. From this office he was admitted to the bar, and at
once started into the practice of law. In 1880 he came to San Francisco and
made the acquaintance of Chris Buckley, who lost no time in finding a place
for him in the District Attorney's office. His loyalty to the blind boss was
rewarded by his election to the office of District Attorney in 1886. It was dur
ing his term of office that the celebrated Little Pete and the Blind White
Devil's alliance shook San Francisco from center to circumference and where
history was made by the fearlessness of what was known as the "Menzies
Grand Jury," which sent Little Pete to Folsom State Prison and Boss Buckley
into exile and to an early political grave. At that time Major Stonehill was
taken suddenly ill. and, obtaining a leave of absence from the Supervisors, he
took no part in the prosecution of Little Pete or of the following up of Buck
ley.
Although a leading member of the Veterans of the Confederacy, Major
Stonehill was thought a great deal of by the members of the Grand Army of
the Republic, and at all the gatherings of George H. Thomas Post, G. A. R.,
he was a guest of honor. He was to have participated in a gathering of
Grand Army men this week.
His funeral will take place on to-morrow from the Masonic Temple at 1:30
p. m. Mount Moriah Lodge, of which ha was a member, will have charge of
the service. In addition to his being a Mason, he was also a member of Red
Men and the American Legion of Honor. He leaves a widow and a step
daughter, Mrs. King, to mourn his departure.
CLARA FOLTZ COMPROMISES.
Her Suit Against Isaac Trumbo Will
Not Come to Trial.
The action of Mrs. Clara L. Foltz
against Isaac Trumbo to recover $4300 al
leged to be due for legal services ren
dered, was compromised in Judge Bahrs'
court yesterday. Just what amount will
be paid Mrs. i'oltz is not known, but will
be when the terms of the compromise
are submitted for the approval of the
court. In her suit against Trumbo, which
was filed last July, Mrs. Foltz alleged
that she had been retained by him to
perform certain legal services, for which
she was to be paid $3000. She performed
the required services and was paid $700,
but the bulk of the fee remained unpaid.
The suit was postponed from month to
month and yesterday was set as the day
for opening the case. The litigants ap
peared in court and shortly before the
case was called, plaintiff and defendant
held a whispered consultation with the
result that a compromise was reached.
When the fact was announced surprise
manifested itself on the face of Attorney
Orove L. Johnson, who represented the
plaintiff, but he expressed no opinion.
Owing to the compromise it is generally
rumored that a case has been taken out
of court in which many interesting de
velopments were expected.

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 18JJ8.
HAVE JUMPED
THEIR BONDS
J. W. Boardman and G. E.
Brown Fail to Appear
in Court.
They Were Arrested for Manu
facturing Bogus Patent
Medicines.
Supposed They Have Gone to Mexico,
but Bench - Warrants Were
Issued for Their Arrest.
When the cases of George E. Brown
and J. W. Boardman, the druggists who
manipulated the scheme to flood the
city with bogus patent medicines,
principally Castoria and Carter's Lit
tle Liver Pills, were called in Judge
Joachimsen's court yesterday morning
the defendants did not answer to their
names. It was announced that they
had apparently left the city, having
been released on bonds last Wednes
day.
The bonds were accepted by Judge
Campbell, $500 for Brown and $300 for
Boardman. There were two charges
against Brown, and Judge Campbell re
leased him on his recognizance on the
second charge. The bondsmen in eac h
case were Alexander Campbell Jr., at
torney, who qualified on real estate in
Berkeley of the value of $3000, and
Thomas King, 764 Mission street, who
qualified on real estate on San Bruno
avenue and Wayland street of the
value af $3000.
Attorney Boyer, who appeared for the
defendants, said he expected that they
would have been present in court, but
he would waive their presence as re
quired by law, and was prepared to go
on with the case.
The Judge said he had no objections
if ex-Judge Van R. Paterson would
consent. He agreed to the proposition,
and after the Judge had issued bench
warrants for the arrest of the two de
fendants evidence for the prosecution
was taken in the case of Brown on the
charge of unlawfully affixing a coun
terfeit trademark on goods. Then At
torney 80-yer, for the defendants,
moved for a dismissal on various
grounds, which will be argued to-mor
row morning. All the other cases were
continued until then.
At the time Boardman was arrested
last Tuesday he was at the ferry, and
.had bought his ticket for Mexico. When
Brown was arrested by Detectives Dil
lon and Crockett the same day he told
them that if they had been a day or
two later they would not have been
able to get him. Being convinced of
the fact that the two men would flee
from the city if they got a chance
Judge Paterson particularly requested
that their bonds should be made as
high as possible. His suspicions, as
the result shows, have been verified,
and the bondsmen will have to make
the bonds good.
A peculiar incident happened In court
during the hearing of the case. Attor
ney Boyer had brought from the law li
brary a volume of the California re
portp, as he Intended to quote a case
on his motion for a dismissal. He laid
the book on the table in front of him.
and about half an hour afterward it
had disappeared. A search for it
proved fruitless, and the conclusion ar
rived at was that some one had stolen
it and sold it to get money for liquor.
A DOLLAR FOR HIS WIDOW.
Will Placed on File Telling the
Story of an Unhappy Married
Life.
Vlncenzo Bello of this city Is dead and
his earthly troubles all over, but behind
him he left a will that tells a story of
unhappiness personified. By the terms of
the will an estate valued at $27. r >o is be
queathed the testator's family, but he
cuts his widow. Alexandria 80110, and
his son Joseph and daughter Augusta off
with a dollar each, and gives the remain
der of his estate to his children Vieto,
Ellenor, Annie and George to share and
share alike. In introduction to the un
usual will, which was filed for probate
yesterday, the deceased states: "I direct
after my death that I be buried in a de
cent manner, and that twenty carriages
be permitted to carry such of my friends
as wish to attend my funeralâ my wife to
be excluded." After disposing of the es
tate as above stated the testator con
tinues: "I desire any court or Judge
thereof, where this may come, or the set
tlement or distribution" of my estate may
be had to refuse my wifeâ if she then be
a widow or otherwiseâ maintenance or
any benefit from my estate except the $1
herein provided for, so far as the same
can be legally done, for the reason that
at the time of our marriage she had no
means of livelihood. I was fourteen
years older than she was; she married
me for my property; she never loved or
respected me. She treated me in a cruel
and inhuman manner, and in the pres
ence of our children and others called me
vile names. She is an anarchist, and in
her heart has always wished for my
death, and lias tried to kill me by poi
sons; also by assassination."
Such are â¢ the accusations of Bello
against his widow in the will filed yes
terday, but whether or not his wishes
will be obeyed by the court remains to
be seen.
ALBERT F. G. "HOFF"
PLEADS NOT GUILTY
His Attorney Makes a Futile
Effort to Get the Accused
Liberated.
In Two Weeks a Day Will Bo Set
on Which He Will .Go
to Trial.
Albert Frederic George Vereneseckoc
kockhoff, otherwise known for conveni
ence sake as Albert Hoff, pleaded not
guilty to the charge of murder against
him before Judge Cook yesterday morn
ing. When proceedings opened and
prior to the plea of the accused be
ing entered upon the record, Attorney
Schooler. Â»r the defense, made an ef
fort to dear his prisoner on technical
grounds, but the effort was without
avail. A motion was first made by At
torney Schooler to set aside the infor
mation against Hoff on the ground that
Police Court 3, from which department
his client was held to answer, is a cre
ation of special legislation, and in con
sequence is unconstitutional. Follow
ing is the motion in brief:
"Firstâ That before filing thereof, the
defendant had not beta legally commit
ted by a magistrate.
'â¢Secondâ That tho information here
in purports to be filed upon a pretend
ed examination of one H. L. Joachim
sen, who falsely and illegally pretend
ed to De a Judge of a pretended Police
Court of the city and county of San
Francisco, State of California, upon a
false, illegal and pretended commit
ment made by said H. L, Joachimsen,
who falsely and illegally pretended to
make such commitment.
"Third â That the said pretended Po
lice Court, neither at the time of the
pretended examination nor at the time
of the false, illegal and pretended com
mitment, had not any legal existence
under the constitution and laws of the
State of California.
"Fourthâ That said H. L. Joachimsen
is not and was not at the time of said
pretended examination of' the defend
ant, nor at the time of the false, .ille
gal and pretended commitment of the
defendant, a magistrate under the laws
of the State of California, who had
power and authority to examine and
commit the defendant in respect to the
matter charged in said information."
Judge Couk promptly denied the mo
tion, and the attorney stated that he
would carry the motion to the Supreme
Court for linul decision. This point
settled, a new tack in the case of Al
bert Hoff, but one that was worn to a
fringe in the trial of the late Theodore
Durrant was taken by the defense. A
demurrer to the information was read
and placed on file. It asked that the
prisoner be released from custody, as
he was held in violation of the fifth
amendment of the constitution of the
United States, which provides for in
dictment by Orand Jury in criminal
cases, and as Hoff was not held by in
dictment that constitutional provision
had been violated. It was also alleged
that other constitutional provisions had
been violated, but Judge Cook refused
to entertain the demurrer. Hoff then
pleaded not guilty, and his case went
over two weeks, and on that day a
date for the trial will be set

LUM FUNG HO
NOT A NATIVE
Obtained Admission to
This Country by
Fraud.
Coached on Shipboard to Swear
That a Stranger Was
Her Father.
A Full Confession Made by Her to
the Ladies of the Methodist
Mission.
Lam Fung Ho, the Chinese grirl
whom United States Commissioner
Heacock recommended for deportation,
has^nade another confession to the ef
fect|that she had gained admission to
this; country by fraud.
W^iile awaiting the action oÂ£ the Fed
eral} authorities she had been confined
in the County Jail, and for the past two
or three days had been very despond
ent. Last Friday night she sent for a
Chinaman, who had taken much inter
est in having her landed here, and
when he called upon her she requested
him to go to the Methodist Mission, at
916 Washington street, and inform the
ladies in charge that she wished to
have them call upon her. She threat
ened, that, in the event of his refusal
to do her bidding, she would dash out
her brains against the walls of her cell
or commit suicide in some other way,
and, her spirit, changed into a devil,
would haunt him day and night as long
as he lived.
The Chinaman's superstitious fears
having been thus worked upon, he did
not dare to disobey the woman, and he
carried her message to the mission.
Two of the ladies who spoke Chinese
called at the jail, and Miss Ho made
a full confession to them.
She said that while on the voyage
from China to this port she was re
quired to commit to memory a story
written in Chinese on a paper to the
effect that she was born in San Fran
cisco, and that she was coming hither
to meet her father and to be married to
a husband whom the father had pro
vided for her.
This story she told under oath when
she was examined by 'the Chinese Bu
reau. A photograph of the man who
was to pose as her father was sent to
her in China a short time before she
left, and she was required to study the
features carefully, so that she would

not have any difficulty in recognizing
him as soon as she saw him. The pu
tative father also appea7ed before the
bureau and swore that the girl was his
daughter.
Miss Ho subsequently confessed the
fraud to Dr. Gardner, Chinese interpre
ter for the bureau, and because he
swore to this fact before Commissioner
Heacock he was vindictively abused in
the argument of the attorney for the
Chinese slave dealers.
United "States District Judge De
Haven yesterday morning ordered that
Miss Ho be taken from the County Jail
and be placed in charge of the ladies
of the Methodist Mission pending fur
ther action in the matter.
Yesterday afternoon the girl asked to
be taken to the Chinese Consul-Gen
eral, and there repeated her confession,
and asked that steps be taken to pre
vent her being sent back to China until
she could communicate with her moth
er, as she was afraid of the men on
the steamer. She said that the men
who coached her regarding what she
was to say when she arrived here were
still on the China, and if she went with
them she would never see her mother.
The Consul-General interested him
self in the matter and took down her
statement and then authorized Mrs.
Lake of the Methodist Mission House
to ask Judge de Haven, for him, to
hold the girl until such time as he
could communicate with China, and see
that the girl was properly cared for on
her arrival in that country. Applica
tion will be made to-morrow for a
stay. _____ - _^____
RAILROAD CAR THIEVES.
John Brogan and Matthew Quinn
Arrested for Burglary.
John Brogan and Matthew Qulnn, well
known thieves, were arrested yesterday
afternoon by Detectives Ryan and ODea
and Special Officer Lewin of the Southern
Pacific Company and booked at the City
Prison on a charge of burglary.
Tuesday last they broke into several ca
boose cars on Townsend street, near
Eighth and stole forty journal bearings,
which they sold to a junk dealer. When
searched they had in their pockets keys
that would open any railroad car.
Last July they broke into a number of
the palace cars that had brought the
Christian Endeavorers to the city, ripped
them up and stole all the Ttrass they
could carry away. They were arrested,
pleaded guilty to petty larceny and got
six months in the County Jail.
BRAVED A BURGLAR.
Officer Kearney Fires Two Shots and
He Thinks He Hit Him.
Policeman William A. Kearney, son of
Denis Kearney, the well-known politician,
distinguished himself yesterday in an en
counter with a burglar.
The robber tried to enter the residence
at 36 Lincoln place about 3 o'clock yes
terday morning, when Kearney went
downstairs and in his nightdress drove
him away. When quiet was restored, the
unwelcome visitor returned and Kearney
fired two shots at him, and believes one
of the shots took effect.
The case was reported to the police
yesterday, and up to a late hour detec
tives were scouring the city for the
wounded burglar.
THE CRACKER
COMBINE BROKEN
Failure of a Member of the
Compact to Maintain
Prices.
The Portland Company Makes ths
First Cut, Which the Others
Meet.
The compact has been broken and a
merry war is now waging between the
different cracker manufacturing com
panies of the coast. About one year ago
a compact was formed by the American
Biscuit Company and Standard Bisruit
Company of San Francisco and the Port
land Cracker Company of Portland, Or.,
agreeing to maintain a uniform price
upon all goods sold by each.
All went well with the combine until re
cently, when, it is claimed by the local
manager of the Portland Cracker Com
pany, the Standard Biscuit Company
failed to keep all of the condftions of tha
compact. Not being able to settle the
matter amicably the Portland Cracker
Company inaugurated a war In prices,
first making a cut of 25 per cent and
later on increasing the same to 40 per
cent. These cuts were of course met by
the other members of the late combine-,
and where the end will be is a matter of
conjecture.
James Dunne, manager of the AmerN
can Biscuit Company, when questioned
relating to the condition of affairs dis-.
claimed all knowledge thereof, saying
that he had not heard of a cut in price*
and that he was still billing goods at old
prices. He will probably soon awaken to
a full realization of the situation.
E. D. Baker, manager and a director of
the Portland Cracker Company, says that
the war will be continued to the bitter
end, notwithstanding the fact that hÂ«
estimates the loss to the different com
panies concerned to be over $50,000 per
month. The same state of affairs exists
in Los Angeles and Portland as exista
here.
In Los Angeles the war Is between th*
Southern California Cracker Company
and the Portland Cracker Company.
In Portland the fight la between the
Portland Cracker Company and Bishop
& Co., cracker manufacturers of Los An
geles.
Phil I. Jacoby, president of the Stan
dard Biscuit Company, freely acknowl
edges the existence of a Berious war be
tween the different companies, and claims
that the invasion of the Portland Cracker
Company into the Los Angeles and San
Francisco territories Is the cause of all
the trouble. He does not see any hope
for Immediate settlement of the trouble.
The Grutli Verein.
The San Francisco GrutU Vereln held
Its annual masquerade ball In Saratoga
Hall last evening, a notable feature of
which was the originality and variety of
the costumes displayed. The attendance
was g-ood and all enjoyed an unusually
pleasant evening. The committee irÂ»

CHANGED THE
RELAY RULES
Monthly Meeting of the Califor
nia Associated Cycling
Clubs.
Details of Running the Big One-Hun
.l red- Mile Race Considerably
Altered.
The regular monthly meeting of the ;
Br.ard or Governors of the California As
ted cycling Clubs was held last
evening- at the Olympic Club, the follow- ;
Ins club* h-Ang represented: Bay City
Wheelmen. Capital City Wheelman. Im- |
perial Cycling Club. Olympic Club Wheel
men, Pathflndei Cycling Club. Reliance |
Club Wheelmen, Ariel Bicycle Club and
Eno'im;! Cyclers.
Th* road racing and records commit- !
tee, through chairman Myrick. presented
h 'â¢< rgthy report, containing some recom- , ;
mcndftthnu regarding changes In racing
I and rules. It recommended that
irn Is ftea L,eundro of the twenty- |
gve-ratla course be changed from Hepburn
stir. : ; t 0 Saundera street, the latter be
lr.Â« much wider and more easily made.
Iterenoe in distance caused by thiÃ j
will hring the start 153 feet south
from the center line of Ward street and !
Hay ward* road.
The report recommended the appoint- J
ment of patrol judges for the relay race,
*9 prevent illegal pacing and other in- j
frinjrements of the rules. It also advised
/hanging the date of the relay from the
first Sunday in April to the second Sunday
in May.
The cup offered by Leavltt and Bill for
the relay race, valued at $350, was ac
cepted by the association, and thanks
were extended to Morgan and Wright
and Thomafl H. B. Varney for their of
fers of trophies.
After nearly an hour's bootless discus
sion, started by Winslow of the Imperial
Club, and J.erome of the Reliance Club,
the association passed an amendment to
the relay rules to the effect that each
relay rider shall ride only his own wueei
or that of his trailer.
This seems a most nonsensical rule, as
the burden of proof as to whether a man
rode, a wheel he was entitled to would
lie with the Judges at the end of each
relay, and in the excitement incident to
the finish of each relay it would be al
most impossible to check them, even if
the judges were not so busily employed
taking times and checking riders finish
ing as to have no time to attend to it.
Dr. Hill moved for a reconsideration of
the matter, and it will come up again at
the next meeting.
Winslow of the Imperial Club was ap
pointed a committee of one to take tbe
name and number of every wheel finish
ing in all the annual races of the asso
ciation, the valuable data thus secured to
be reported to, Chairman Myrick of the
racing board.
The chairman appointed Messrs. My
rick. Dodge, Bhedd. J. Hancock, Argentl
and Swain a committee to remeasure the
relay course.
The next meeting of the association will
be neld at the rooms of the Bay City
Wheelmen on March fi.

possessed by chiefs and hoarded by
i them, not so much In intelligence of
their value as in a firm fetichism. The
I stones have come to their hands by the
good old-fashioned method of stealing
them from the Kimberley mines years
ago, before the present minute watch
against gem-thieving was systematized
Diamond-stealing at present is prac
tically impossible under the peculiar
methods of its prevention. Before the
rigid examination of workmen and vis
itors began to be enforced, native labor
ers often were under a secret compact
with their tribal rulers not to come
back from the mines without a good
sized stolen diamond for the chief's
use; hence, a great many superb gems
are in the dark unfathomed caves of a
Kaffir headman's establishment. Within
a few years enterprising traders have
made special expeditions and palavers
for diamonds so hidden, with the result
of successful bartering for them.
Liquor and guns have been found use
ful. In some instances the supersti
tion of the chiefs stood in the way of
traders recovering valuable stones; but,
on the other hand, a small company
working on this line of acquisition is
credited with having obtained within
four months not less than two hundred
thousand dollars' worth of diamonds.
One agent succeeded in buying of a
chief pix stones of more than two hun
dred karats each. â Harper's Weekly.

Policemen Were Notified, but a

Was Made in Vain.
NO VALUABLES PROCURED
Chief Officer of the Ship Alexander
McNiel Made the Com
plaint
Early yesterday morning J. Sevrn,
chief officer of the ship Alexander Mc-
Nlel, which arrived In this port Thurs
day night, and one of his men, A. John
son, were "stood up" at the junction of
Market and Kearny streets by two
men who first asked for the time of
day. When the officer stated the time
to the men they were told to give up
their money and valuables and not to
make an outcry or they would suffer in
a decidedly unpleasant manner.
When the parties who had been stop
ped realized that they were about to
be robbed and as they had considera
ble money on their persons they start
ed in to annihilate their assailants, but
Johnson soon wished that he had taken
the robbers' advice and not attempted
any violence, as he was repeatedly
struck on the head with a heavy club
which the taller of the two was using
with a vengeance. No noise was made
by either the assailed or the assail
ants, but in a moment the parties who
were accosted and beaten started on a
run down Market street toward Stock
ton. They met a police officer and told
the tale in a hurried way and the three
started for the place where the daring
attempt at robbery had taken place.
The officer made a search of the
doorways in the vicinity and looked
for any suspicious looking characters,
but without avail, and the search was
abandoned in a short while, as it was
presumed that the desperate charac
ters had run down the street and made
their escape in the darkness. The mat
ter was reported to police headquarters
by the assailed men, and it is probable
the streets in the neighborhood of the
attempted robbery will be closely
watched during the early morning
hours. According to the report of
Sevrn the attempt to rob him was an
exceedingly daring and desperate one,
as it was within a few feet but in the
rear of a cigar store which was still
oppn. From his statement it was
learned that they had left the ship
early in the evening with the Intention
of visiting friend* They were about
to return to their rooms when they met
the men who attempted to rob them of
their money and valuables. After the
men had been told the time they or
dered "hands up," and the fight start
ed, with the result that valuables were
saved, but Johnson received several
blows on the head which were not
pleasant to have.
The police are of the opinion that the
men are old timers, as it is seldom an
attempt is made to rob people in the
heart of the city, where parties are
constantly passing by except at the
hour chosen for the attempted robbery
Sevrn is determined to have the matter
thoroughly looked into and has given
a good description of the men to en
able the police to work to a better ad
vantage.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. .1. Norman, 1017-1028 Mission.
THE HAYTIAN GENERAL'S GLASS
EYE.
A Haytian general having lost an eye
in battle, sent to Paris for an artificial
one. The makersent in return one of his
best. Shortly after the general return
ed it. with the remark that the eye was
too yellow, and recalled to his mind the
Spanish flag, adding at the same time
that he would wear only an eye having
the colors of hiÃ own country. The
maker thereupon made one with red
and green predominating (these being
the Haytian colors). This so pleased
the general that instead of wearing the
eye, as originally intended, he added it
to his collection of medals. â The Post-

THREATENED
TO ASSAULT

Revolt by Prisoners
Against Short
Rations.
They Declare That They
Do Not Get Sufficient

An Appeal for More Food to
Be Sent to Chief of Police
Lees To- Day.
RIOT IN THE CITY PRISON.
The Participants In tho Affair Were
Subdued After Considerable
Trouble.
There came near being a riot In the
City Prison yesterday afternoon, due
to the refusal of the cook to give the
prisoners confined in cell 27 sufficient
food. Shortly after 4 o'clock the cook,
who is also a prisoner, walked down
the corridor dealing out to the prison
ers their usual supply of rations. When
he reached cell 27, in which are confin
ed a number of desperate characters,
one of them complained of the lack of
bread.
-We are being slowly starved," he
remarked, walking over to the cook.
"It is bad enough to be locked up with
out being deprived of the necessaries
of life."
His fellow prisoners took up the cry,
and as if by prearrangement they
started for the cook. The latter realiz
ing that they meant business appealed
to the officer in charge to protect him.
As he darted along the corridor the
curses of the men could be heard out
side the prison.
After considerable difficulty they ;
were quieted, not until, however, they
were given an additional supply of
bread.
When seen later the prisoners bitter
ly complained of the treatment ac
corded them.
"We don't get half enough to eat,
declared the toughest of the gang.
"It seems as if the prison officials are ;
determined to kill us off by starving
US. It is fortunate for us that we are
compelled to remain here only a few
days, when, if we don't beat our cases,
we are sent to the County Jail, where
we can at least expect to get sufficient
to eat. The unfortunate women who
are thrown in here are subjected to the
same treatment, frequently being
forced to beg from the male prisoners
pieces of bread to appease their appe- ;
tite."
Recently considerable complaint has
been made by the prisoners confined
in the City Prison about the food they
receive. They claim that Captain Rob- |
Inson has cut short their rations to
such an extent that they have not suffi
cient to eat.
The prisoners confined in rely 2< are
preparing a petition relating their
grievances, which they intend to send
to Chief Lees to-day. In the meantime
the cook, who is partly blamed for not j
giving them the usual allowance of j
food, momentarily fears that the pris
oners will attempt to "do him up" un- <
less the rations are increased.
Want the Location Changed.
'The West of Castro Street Improvement
Club has made a protest to the Board
of Supervisors regarding the proposed lo
cation of the City and County Hospital
and the PfSthouse. The petition re
cites thiit the Balboa boulevard passes
by the Almshouse tract, and that the lo
cation of a pesthouse and hospital there
will be a serious detriment to the city.
The matter will be brought up before
the Hospital Committee, at the next
meeting.
NO PORK CHOPS.
An ethical consideration of diet, with
renunciation of flesh, alcohol and all
trrOÃfl matters, find the cultivation of â¢
the new. incoming body-cells with pure,
solarized, buoyant foods which shall
develop serenity, wisdom and health,
prepares the way and makes the paths :
straight for the deliverance of the as
pirant spirits from its material gyves.â

Swedish Society's Masquerade.
Gay, fantastic figures, robed in almost
every known costume and a few hitherto
unknown, formed the leading feature at
the annual masquerade ball of the Swe
dish and Finnish Relief Society held in
Vnion-square Hall last evening. The af
fair was a success from the time the first
dance was called until the notes of
"Home, Sweet Home" were sounded
early this morning. The members of the
committee have been working with inde
fatigable energy for some weeks to make
this, their seventh affair, a success, and
their energies were not wasted. The
friends of the organization, aware of the
fact that It is a purely philanthropic one,
turned out en masse, and the result of
the night's entertainment will be felt
throughout the coming year by hundreds
who need relief. The committee, whose
able management was everywhere mani
fested, consists of Dr. Oscar Gruggel,
Mrs. R. Lindberg, Mrs. Fred Johnson]
Mrs. G. E. F. Anderson and Mrs. Joseph
ina Janssun.

OUTCLASSED
BY FLEUR DE LIS
The Daughter of Maxim
Took the Tarpey Stake
in a Walk.
Considered a Formidable Can
didate for the Brooklyn
Handicap.
Three Favorites Finished in Front
Thorpe's Weak Ride Caused
the Defeat of Orimar.
The Tarpey stake, a handicap valued
at $1000, was decided at Ingleside yes
terday and the winner, Fleur de Lis, is
now heralded as the probable winner of
the Brooklyn handicap, in which race
she has been allotted 103 pounds. The
ring was pleased to lay 6 to 5 against
the daughter of Maxim, and It was
eagerly grabbed up. Rated behind the
other four starters until the stretch
was reached, "Skeets" Martin there
slid through an opening and won In
a romp from the black horse Judge
Denny, ridden by Dick Clawson. Lin
stock, carrying 95 pounds, of which
great things were expected, was poorly
handled by little Gray, but managed
to get the show from Imp. Tripping.
The winner covered the mile and a fur
long in 1:57^4.
The raw, biting weather and the
presence of rain kept many from the
track, only those with a good thing
pinned in their hats attending. The
handicappers figured things about
right and the majority of the books
quit behind on the day's gambling.
Three first choices, two second choices
and an outsider took the purses.
In the two-year-old event, at four
furlongs, Formero, a son of imp. Con
veth, upset calculations by beating the
8 to 5 favorite. Saintly, a neck in 60V4
seconds. Ridden by H. Brown, the
chestnut youngster hit the stretch
second to Gold Scratch, and there as
suming the lead drew away and won
with nothing to spare. Milt Young, one
of the Corrigan entries, was a good
third.
Of the official fifteen entries in the
six-furlong selling run that followed
but six started. Caliente, with Thorp
up, had first call in the betting, and
catching Mainstay in the home run
led the big chestnut past the tape over
a length in 1:1614. Kamsln, who re
ceded in the betting and does not seem
to he much of a Saturday horse, man
aged to struggle into the show.
Willie Martin and Can't Dance were
seen to good advantage in the mile and
three furlong run, decided under sell
ing conditions. The Longfellow horse
was second choice to Tulare. but should
have been a 1 to 2 shot. Martin allowed
Little Cripple and Rufalba to make
the running to the stretch, where he
moved toward the front and if was all
over. "Jockey Bill's" mount won as
he pleased, with Rufalba second, a
head in front of "Wawona. Thorpe,
astride the favorite, Tulare, met with
more difficulties than an old veteran
trying to get a pension from the Gov
ernment, and eventually brought up a
bod last.
It would begin to seem as though
Veragua had a cinch on all of the hur
die affairs at the local track. Should
ering 146 pÂ°unds j ie was again pound
ed off the boards, and leading from the
start, won by thirty open lengths.
Monlta was once more an easy second,
a dozen lengths ahead of Our Climate.
De Soto feil from the back of Governor
Budd at the fifth jump, and J O C and
Presidio Mere both pulled up with bro
ken pedigrees. The erratic Alvarado
was a supposed good thing, but the
price was too short and he was left at
the post. Some day he will be a good
timber topper.
On past performances Orimar looked
the biggest sort of. "cinch" for the
final seven furlong run. There were
some swell losers about and it was de
cided that Orimar must be downed.
Accordingly Ed Gartland was hurried
ly initiated as a member of the light

artillery and carried the* wise money,
his odds being played down from 4 to
ji. Away in front, he ran like a wild
horse and beat the wretchedly ridden
Orimar less than a length. It was only
one of the many "toboggan slides" put
through at the meeting just finished.
TRACK ITEMS.
The stewards were compelled to take
cognizance of Willie Martin's pugilistic
seance on Friday and yesterday ordered
him suspended for one week.
Dick Clawson put up a very weak ride
on the favorite. Saintly, in the two-year
old run. It was about on a parallel with
his effort astride Dr. Sharp the day pre
ceding. The boys seem to have the idea
that the judges will stand for "any old
thing," and they are playing it off the
board. Some day there will be an up
heaval and the Little Pete scandal will
Be but a drop in the bucket.
All riders have "off days," and yester
day must have been Thorpe's. If he
knew what he was doing with Tulare no
intelligent onlooker was able to fathom
it. His tardy ride on Orimar was another
brilliant piece of horsemanship.
It plight be well to call the attention of
the judges to the grand race of Ed Gart
land numbered 3:55 In the form-book. In
that race Maxello beat Prince Tyrant
two lengths and the latter colt finished
seven lengths in front of Gartiand. On
December 30 Orimar was beaten in a des
perate finish a nose and half a length
by Buckwa and The Roman, and on
Thursday last ran a good second to Gey
ser. People are getting tired of these
"reversals," as they are referred to, and
if some of the horsemen use "speed
lozenges" one day and leave them out of
the horse the next time out the tracks
will find their gate receipts diminishing.
"Skeets" Martin, it is said, is anxious
to ride Fleur de I.is In the Brooklyn
handicap if the mare reaches the East
in good shape.
READING-ROOM
FOR JACK TAR
The Seamen's Catholic Insti
tute to Open This Even
ing.
All Sailors Welcome Without Dis
tinction of Race, Color or â 
Creed.
I ' â  : â â¢â â 'â -' â  . . '
This evening will see the opening of a
Seamen's Catholic Institute and Free
Reading Room under the direction of the
Paulist Fathers at No. 9 Mission street,
near the ferries.
All seamen, without distinction of race.
color or creed, are entitled to its privi
leges, and In its reading room the choicest
literature will be found.
It is an institution that has long been
needed in this city, and one which will
surely succeed. There all sailors will be
welcomed as though it were a home, and
many is the happy hour that Jack 'iar
will spend around the fire singing songs
and telling tales, relating experiences and
listening to others. There will always
be a bright fire, and on wintry evenings,
when he is on shore and would naturally
seek a saloon for companionship and
warmth, he will find this unnecessary.
This evening the first sermon will be
preached also by one of the Paulist lath
ers. The headquarters of the institute
have been tastily and well fixed up, and
a large number of jolly Tars will be pres
ent.

THE DROUGHT
IS BROKEN
Light Rains Fall Throughout
the State but Not Much
Good Done.
Weathar Station Will Soon Be Ea- '
teblished at Mount
Tamalpais.
Weather Forecaster W. H. Hammon
says that the rains of yesterday are due
to a storm which has its center in Van
couver. The rain has been steadily mov
ing during the past tweTity-four hours
southeastward, and reached San Luis
Obispo at 5 o'clock last evening. It rained
Friday night in Washington and Oregon
and yesterday morning at Eureka. Ip
to 5 o'clock yesterday evening one-quar
ter of an inch fell in Sacramento, one
inch at Red Bluff, but none at Fresno,
though the wind was southeast and rain
fell before midnight.
The wind will shift to the west to-day,
though there will be showers succeeded
by fair weather. We will probably get
a half inch of rain before it ceases.
The storm has destroyed the conditions
that have caused the recent- drought.
There was such an area of high pressure
over the plateau region in Nevada, Utah
and Idaho, that it has deflected every
storm that came near this coast. But
the last storm was of sufficient energy
to reduce that high pressure, and should
it return after breaking Sunday, or a
new one come, it will not be obliged to
overcome the conditions in the plateau
region, and the result will be plentiful
rains.
Yesterday's rain covered half the State,
but not enough to do a great amount of
good, although there was plenty rain
north of this city. If the storm should
break Sunday, it is more than likely that
it will return in from twelve to thirty
six hours, and an ample amount of rain
for the nereis of the State will fall.
It is extremely difficult to forecast
properly, for the conditions have not been
the same in twenty years, though in IS9I
the storm was five days drawing the
cold air out of the plateau region before
any rain fell at all. The drought which
then existed was broken on February 9,
and up to that date only 4.9 inches fell,
while this season there has been a fall of
5.2 inches to date.
Mr. Hammon also says that he is hope
ful that a weather station will soon be
equipped on Mount Tamalpais which
would be of incalculable value for weath-
er prognostications.
There is a small equipment at the pres
ent time on the mountain, and the Chief
of the Weather Bureau has made re
quisitions for Increased facilities at that
station, and no doubt the plans will be
carried out.
Disturbance in Court.
Michael O'Brien, a contractor on Gold
en Gate avenue, went into Judge Conlan's
court room yesterday morning and raised
such a disturbance that the Judge or
dered him into custody on a charge of
disturbing the peace. O'Brien Friday
called at the Mechanics' Pavilion to col
lect an account from one of the exhibit
ors. He was refused admittance, as he
had no ticket, and he became so abusive
that he was thrown out. He went to As
sistant Prosecuting Attorney Hogan of
Judge Conlan's court to get a warrant
for battery, but as he had no witnesses
with him he was told to call next morn
ing. He aprain raised such a row that
Hogan threw him out of his office.
Found Dead in Bed.
M. Bullwinkle. a cabinet-maker, aged
40 years, was found dead in bed at his
room in the Prescott house at 933 Keamy
street last evening. Death was proba
bly due to natural causes, but as the
man had been out of work for some time
the landlord of the house thought it
might be a case of suicide, so had the
body taken to the Morgue.

CATARRH OFJTHE STOMACH.
! A Pleasant - Simple, ; but Safe '- Effectual
; ;â  Cure for It. Â '
1 Catlarrh of the stomach has long
been Iconsidered the next thing to in-,
curable.
The usaul symptoms are . a full . , or
bloating sensation after eating, accom-
panied sometimes with : sour or watery
risings, a formation of gases, causing
pressure on the ; heart and . lungs and
difficult breathing; headache, fickle ap-
petite, ' nervousness and a general
played out, languid feeling.
There is often a foul -taste in the
mouAh, coated tongue, and if the in-
terio* of the' stomach could be seen it
would show a slimy, inflamed condi-
tion. : .... , '. â â /-.';W V . â  . .
The cure for this common and ob-
stinate trouble is found in a treatment
which' causes the food ,to be readily,
thoroughly digested before it has time
to ferment and irritate the delicate
mucous surfaces of the stomach.
. According to Dr. Harlanson the
safest and best treatment is to use af-
ter bach meal a tablet, composed of
Disatase, Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux,
Golden Seal and fruit acids.
These tablets can' now be found at
all drugstores under the name of Stu-
art's ; Dyspepsia Tablets, and, not
being a patent medicine, can be used
with perfect safety and assurance that
healthy appetite and thorough diges-
tion will follow their regular use after
meals. / ' â¢
Mr. N. J. Booher of 2710 Dearborn,
street, Chicago, â 111.,- writes: "Catarrh
is a â¢ local condition resulting from a
neglected . cold in . the head, whereby
the lining membrane of the nose be-
comes inflamed and the poisonous dis-
charge therefrom, passing backward
into the throat, reaches the stomach,
thus producing catarrh of the stomach. !

Friends of Dr.

Politicians Are Speculating
on Its Probable
Effect.
George B. Daniels Is Now the General
Manager of the New
Directory-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Feb. 5.
Hon. Frank A. Leach, superintendent
Of the mint at San Francisco, retired
from a long life of journalism to-day.
For thirty-seven years Mr. Leach has
been engaged in newspaper work, be
ginning as a boy and working upward
r proprietor. Two weeks ago The Call |
published exclusively the story that the
( Â»akland Enquirer, which paper has
been owned by Mr. Leach about twelve
years, was to go into the hands of
other owners. This afternoon the
change took place and the management
of the paper was reorganized.
The statement was published this
evening that M. D. L. Hadley had be
come The owner, but he evidently did
not hold the stock long, for to-night
G. B. Daniels announced that the new
hoard of directors is as follows: G.
B Daniels, president and general man
ager; M. D. L. Hadley, secretary; S. F.
Daniels, treasurer; D. Edward Collins
and A. L. Smith.
Frank A. Leach and his managing
â¢dltor. A. B. Nye. signed the following
printed statement:
The Enquirer has been published as
a daily paper since the 12th day or
July, 18S6â more than eleven yearsâ
and during the whole of that time the
undersigned have exercised editorial
direction over its utterances. In the
initial number the promise was made
to give the people of Oakland a clean
and honest newspaper, which would
not shrink from putting principle
above policy in any important exigen
cy, and looking back over the occur
rences of nearly a dozen years, it is
believed that the obligation taken at
that time has been kept.
It has not been always" ea,Â«y to con
duct the Enquirer upon the lines laid
down. It has cost some struggles and
sacrifices But in the main the. people
of the community have been very
kind, showing a ready appreciation of
everything which it was endeavored
to do in their behalf, and it is owing
to this generous support that the de-.
gree of success attained has been pos-i
sible. It is desired to make the ac
knowledgment of this friendly co-op
eration distinct and emphatic. â¢ â¢
The new management will, of
course, announce its own policy, but
it is understood that it will in no es
sential respect differ from the past
policy.
Of more general Interest than the
actual transfer of the Enquirer is the
effect it will undoubtedly have on the
gubernatorial contest in this county.
T'p to this time it has been the sup
porter of w. R. Davis, but now it will
be enlisted on the other side and Mr.
Daniels will continue his support of
his friend, Dr. George C. Pardee. How
this change will work is now the upper
most thought in the minds of politi
cians. â¢
NEW PAVILION
READY FOR USE
Fabiola Ladies Take Pride in
Showing the Surgical
Annex.
Equal in Every "Way to Any Similar
Annex in the United
States.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 5.
The new surgical pavilion at Fabiola
â Hospital was opened to-day and many
physicians and others interested in j
modern surgical appliances visited the !
annex.
According to the staff of the hospital
and those doctors who have visited
similar institutions Pabiola now has I
:he most practical and complete surgi
cal pavilion on this coast, and one of
the finest in the country.
Much time and study have been de
voted to it, and every care taken to
make it an ideal surgical institute. The
managers were largely aided in parry
ing out ita plans by the well known
technologist, W. Letts Oliver, who has
superintended its construction and
equipment in accordance with ideas
gathered from many sources. The new
pavilion is in the form of an annex
erected upon columns on a level with
the second floor of the main building,
but completely isolated and communi
cating with the hospital only through
one door. The annex consists of seven
rooms, a large room for major opera
tions, another for minor operations, be
sides laboratory, sterilizing rooms and
dressing rooms.
The quality as well as the quantity
of light has been carefully considered,
and in the opinions of surgeons Fabi
jla's pavilion is perfect in this re
spect. Another important feature is
â¢.hat no nooks or crannies exist where
germs or microbes could gather. In
the operating rooms there are no cor
ners around the walls, ceilings or floor,
all being rounded out so as to be kept
perfectly free. The wooden casings
are of the simplest possible design,
having no grooves or moldings, and
there are no seams or joints of any
kind, v.hile the walls, ceiling, wood
work and furniture are enameled with
a preparation impervious to acids or
alkali. It is so arranged that after
each operation, with a minimum
amount of time and labor, these rooms
can be thoroughly disinfected and
washed.
The Instruments and apparatus are
all of the latest and most improved
design and in every respect up to date
*nd the equal of any outfit in the coun
try. All the tables and necessary fur
niture are of glass and iron, to admit
of being kept perfectly clean and free
from the possibilities of harboring
mentis.
Thf ladies are very proud of this new
addition to their hospital and are
anxious that every doctor In the State
should examine it.
The following officers and directors
have been elected by the Fabiola Hos
pital Association for the ensuing year:
Mrs. John Yule, president; Mrs. Remi
Chabot. Mrs. J. A. Folger, Mrs. R. \V.
Gorrill, vice-presidents; Mrs. A. A.

Debating Society Trial.
OAKLAND. Fob. s.â The Senior Debat
ing Society of the High School attempted
to try Clarence Wills and Louis Rose
berry yesterday for dropping firecrackers
into the room two weeks previous during
a debate by way of the Smead heater.
Parker Holt acted as Judge, B. W. Reed
and Ray MeCargrer attorneys for the
prosecution, Winfleld Dorn and Frank
Nightingale represented the defense,
with Edson Wilcox as clerk. The begin
ning was made in earnest ami would have
resulted in the boys' expulsion from the
society had they been convicted. But
their attorneys secured a ruling at the
In-sinning that would have discharged
them. Hence it was turned into a roar
[ng farce and fun ensued until it grew
too late to remain longer, when they
broke up in a wrangle.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1898.
GOLF CLUB
OPENS HOUSE
Society Receives at Its
New Lakeside
Quarters.
The Great Caledonian Game
Has Rapidly Become
Popular.
Ladies and Qentlemen Who Have
Already Joined the
Club.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 5.
The pretty clubhouse of the Oakland
Golf Club was formally opened with a
reception this afternoon and evening.
The clubhouse, located on one of the
prettiest spots of. Adams Point, has re
cently been built and is a very com
fortable and well fitted structure.
The clubhouse stands among the oak
trees on the land which would be in
cluded in a public park should the city
purchase that property. All around
the house is a piazza twelve feet wide,
each side commanding picturesque
views. The larger portion of the inte
rior is a reception room which to-day
is beautifully decorated. A large fire
place decorated with fancy tiling of a
very artistic nature is the main feature
of this room. It is finished in chiseled
redwood stained with an open trussed
roof. There are also ladies' rooms and
a ladies' clubroom, in addition to
baths. A small kitchen is also there,
and during the golf season there will
be a housekeeper, part of whose duties
will be to provide light luncheons for
the members.
The building is very tastefully light
ed by electricity, and the hot and cold
showers are supplied from the Pied
mont bath-house.
The links embrace a circuit of three
thousand yards, and already the ladies
and gentlemen have done considerable
playing. There are a dozen little cad
dies who carry the. sticks for the play
ers, and each is supplied with a bag.
They depend for their pay on the fees
given them by the players. There are
about 160 members in the club.
Among the most prominent members
of the club are P. E. Bowlea, H. M. A.
Miller, George W. McNear Jr., C. O. G.
Miller, Orestes Pierce, J. W. Phillips
and F. M. Smith, who constitute a
council of seven, Mr. Pierce being pres
ident and H. M. A. Miller secretary.
The colors of the club are white and
green, the national color being red.
The club was organized three weeks
ago and is the pioneer organization of
golf on the coast. The members have
been very liberal in giving furnish
ings, and now settees, soft cushions,
handsome paintings and a piano add
to the enjoyment of the guests be
tween the games.
James Melville, a caddy from Scot
land, is keeper of the green. The cir
cuit begins at the house hole, thence
northeast across the field to the north
arm of the lake, thence west to
the top of the hill off the Pied
mont baths, south to the bath gate and
southeast back to the starting point.
It includes some up and down hill
work, and is considered a very enjoya
ble links.

INVESTIGATION CEASES
Uncertainty, However, Still Sur
rounds the Death of an Italian
Woman at Berkeley.
BERKELEY. Feb. s.â Considerable sus
picion still Burrounrls the peculiar death
of the Italian woman, Mrs. Mary Res
tievo. who died Monday morning after be
ing for more than forty-eight hours in an
epileptic fit. Drs. Hoagland and Woolsey,
who attended the woman, to-day made
inquiries among the neighbors, and were
told by some that the husband had mis
treated his wife. Many of the neighbors,
however, give Restievo a very good repu
tation. Deputy CoronerStreightif of Berk
eley has discontinued his investigations,
believing that inasmuch as the body was
n> '""*Â«r in the county is was for the
San Francisco authorities to look Into
the matter. So far as can be learned no
Investigations ?.rc being made by the Cor
oner of Alameda County or his deputies.
Dr. Woolsey, who was called in Sunday
to attend the woman, said that there' was
no doubt about the cause of death, that
the woman died of epilepsy, although in
an unusual form, as an epileptic fit rarely
lasts fifty-two hours, as in the present
case. Marshal Lloyd, who lives near the
Restievos, scouts the idea of foul play.
Health Officer Rowell signed the burial
permit upon the certificate of Dr. Hoag
land to the effect that death was caused
by epilepsy. The body was immediately
taken charge of by the undertaking firm
of Valente Marini & Co. of San Francis
co, and removed to the city.
The dead woman was 27 years of age
and left three children. According to
neighbors she was a woman of refinement
and intelligence, having been educated in
a San Francisco convent.

THE BOY BURGLAR.
Edmund Hill Released on $200 Bail.
Will Probably Not Be Prose
cuted.
ALAMEPA. Fel>. s.â Edmund Hill, the
16-year-old boy burglar, who was caught
in the very act of entering Olson Broth
ers' grocery store last e%'ening, remained
in jail until this afternoon, when he was
released on $2iXi cash bail, put up by a
relative. He made no attempt what
ever to deny his guilt, as indeed he could
not under the circumstances, having been
apprehended while In the store. When
the Olsons saw the key which he had
used, they recognized it as one which was
luHt from the sum- several weeks ago and
of which no trace had been found since.
They think it was probably left in the
door, and that y.nmg Hill saw it there
and took possession of it.
Hill in pretty well connected, and a
strenuous effort is l-iinp made to prevent
his prosecution. However, as a police
officer saw â  c burglar while committing
his crime, it will b< difficult to protect
him from punishment.
BOARD OF HEALTH.
Dairymen Who Objected to the
Method of Milk Inspection.
ALAMEDA. *'eb. s.â At last nignt's
n". ting of the Board of Health a dele
gation of dairymen was in attendance for
the purpose of making a complaint
against the methods of the milk Inspec
tor. It appeared that some of the dairy
men had been overlooked by the Inspec
tor during the past month, and in the
absence of any test the same figures had
been published as for the previous month.
This, it was claimed, was a hardship, as
it might be that a dairy had been re
ported low for one month, and that tne
owner had token more care and brought
cream and butter fat percentage up
higher, yet received no credit for it on
the Board of Health blackboard or In the
press.
Veterinary Carpenter was called on for
an explanation and gave it.
He said -that he had groat difficulty in
getting samples of milk from the dairy
men. They did not seem willing to ac
commodate him. and he frequently had
to chase them for blocks ajid even run
into their wagons before they would stop
and give him the sample required by law.
It 'was necessary to take the samples
when the milkmen did not expect it, and.
because of the pains taken to prevent
him from doing his duty, it had come
thnt he had not inspected some dairies
during an entire month. In such case he
considered it no more than fair that the
previous month's report should stand
The board thought so, too, and that
ended the discussion.
HIGH-PRICED PAIR OF BOOTS.
Recorder St. Sure Has Them Tried
on in Open Court.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 5.-Hermari Driest
has got to pay $30 for a pair of boots; at
least, the Recorder so decided to-day.
Some time; ago -he directed Shoemaker
Mathaus Stumpf to build a pair of boots |
for him, the agreed price being $12. When !
the footwear was, completed Driest tried 'â â 
them on, but declared that they did not
lit him and â  that he would not pay for ;
therii.VStufnpf tried to persuade him that i
the boots were all right, and that they I
would, be-perfectly comfortable after a '
few days" wear. But Driest would â¢ not !
have it that way, and. after waiting a i
reasonable time," Stumpf brought suit for
the price.' The case was tried to-day be
fore 4 Recorder St. Sure. Testimony was
adduced on both sides, after which the !
Recorder directed Driest to take off his
old boots and put on the new ones. This '
was done, j and then the Recorder/ who i
has an eye himself for a comfortable
boot, Inspected, them critically, and de- '
cided that they were a good enough fit
whereupon he gave judgment for the $12
with, slÃ costs besides, making $30', a very
tidy price for the hoots. But. Driest is
not yet satisfied and swears he will ap
peal the 'case, so that the boots promise
to be pretty expensive to both sides be- !
fore they are worn out or turned over to
the lawyers.-:.; ;' . Â

their astonished parents of what they
had done, were duly and properly for

The young couple are Bernard Noy of

REV. EVERETT
IS NOW FREE
His Wife Tells Her Tale
of Brief Married
Life.
She "Was Chased Through the
House With a Re
volver.
After Two Months They Parted, and
He Now Works as a
Waiter.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 5.
Rev. and Mrs. George Everett of East
Oakland are now Mrs. Mary C. Bacon
and Rev. George Everett. This morn
ing Judge Hall divorced them and
gave the lady permission to use the
name by which she was known before
she met her ex-husband.
Their story of unhappiness was told
this morning by Mrs. Everett in court.
She said her husband was intensely
jealous of her, and suspicious of people
who came to the house.
"My husband watched me wherever
I went," said Mrs. Everett, "and made
charges that were not true. When I
would try to explain away his state
ments he said he was convinced they
were true because he could see through
the walls of a room. I told him that
he was making a holy show of himself,
and he called me a liar and used pro
fane language. We have some boarders
and if I would recognize any of them
at dinner my husband would go into a
passion and curse me, and ask me if
men could not come into my presence
without my smiling at them. I tried
to oblige him by not looking at the
boarders, but it made no difference, and
he was particularly jealous of one of
them named Money.
"One night he was angry -with me,
and I saw him hiding in the back part
of the hall. He frightened me by chas
ing me through the house with a re
volver in his hand. On another occa
sion, while talking to some boarders,
he pulled out his revolver and said, 'I
am going to kill you; this time I mean
business.' He wanted me to sign some
papers regarding the property, but as
it is all mine and he had none, I re
fused to do so.
"Another time he wanted me to drink
something from a vial, which I believe
was poison, and he made himself so of
fensive that finally I was compelled to
call a policeman to have him locked
up, because I thought he was crazy.
"This was two months and a half
after we were married, and I haven't
seen him since."
After hearing her story, Judge Hall
granted the divorce.
Everett was a young religious stu
dent considerably less in years than his
wife. He met Mrs. Bacon last sum
mer at a revival meeting, where he was
preaching, and the widow became so
smitten with the student that they were
married soon after. In the decree
Everett is ordered to pay his wife $15
a month alimony.
Rev. George Everett, who is a gradu
ate of the Chicago Theological Semin
ary, is now a waiter in a San Francisco
restaurant.
DINGEE DOES NOT
WANT PUBLICITY
The President of the Oakland
Water Company Is Se
cretive.
Does Not Want Hia Figures Made
Public Throughout the.
State.
OAKLAND, Feb. s.â The Fire and
Water Committee of the City Council
continued their examination of the re
ports filed by the two water companies
to-night. Measrs. Dingee, Watklnson
and Baker were present, besides several
of the Councilmen. Councilmen Cuvel
lier and Rowe objected strongly to the
operating expenses as filed by the Contra
Costa Company. The $600 commission
for the sale of bonds, the $6000 paid for
the McClure reservoir. $4140 for the Pleas
anton land, and $169 for a barn built
thereon, making a total of $10,909, was
deducted from the company's total.
The Oakland Water Company's presi
dent, Mr. Dingee, was asked to answer
some pointed questions by Councilman
Rowe. He said that the bonded indebt
edness was one. million, but did not know
the cost of the x iedmont plant, but it
was over $200,000. He could not produce
the vouchers for this amount, as the
company was out of existence. When
pressed for the exact cost of the plant
Mr Dlngee explained that he would take
a subcommittee or an expert and give
them the exact figures, but did not want
them flared all over the State. When
asked if he had sworn that the plant was
worth $5,490,037, he answered "\es, less a
note for tfu' $1,000,000."
Mr Rowe â "Is the one million stock and
the three million bonds you spoke of last
evening what you expect the people of
Oakland to pay you a fair rate of Interest
O "'Yes," replied the president wltn a
""If" only one million bonds were Issued
and you still hold the other three, how
do you say that four millions have been
paid out?" asked Mr. Rowe, but his ques
tion remained unanswered.
Chairman Henneherry and Messrs.
Rowe Cuvellier and Upton, Mr. Earl be
ing unavoidably absent, spent the entire
afternoon reading the exhaustive report
of the committee of ISM. during the Par
dec administration. They feel that the
evidence taken and the report made at
that time is of unbounded benefit to them
and express their appreciation of the
work done at that time. They are spend
ing more time in the present examina
tion than have any committee since 1894.
They do not expect to have a report
reaclv for Monday evening unless an af
ternoon session is -held on Monday, which
was not definitely settled to-night. How
ever they are determined to fix a rate
this month according to law.

PIT BIG MONEY
IN THE BONDS
H. J. Crocker Invested
$800,000 in Sierra
Railway Paper.
Prefers to Rely Upon Local
Undertakings When Op
portunity Offers.
Maurice Casey to Be One of the
Directors of the New
Road.
A financial transaction of more than
ordinary magnitude took place the
other day when Henry J. Crocker pur
chased nearly the whole bond issue of
the Sierra Railway Company of Cali
fornia. The entire amount of the is
sue was $634,000, and of this $515,000
was taken by Mr. Crocker, who would
have secured it all had not the balance
been previously contracted for.
Mr. Crocker, however, is not alone in
the deal, as it is understood that sev
eral other leading capitalists of this
city are also interested.
When the Sierra Railway Company
was organized it was bonded for $15,
000 a mile. These bonds were not sold
immediately to build the road, but
were held until its completion, so that,
its earning capacity having been
shown, a better price could be secured
for them.
The road, which is forty-three miles
in length, running from Oakdale,
Stanislaus County, to Jamestown,
Tuolumne County, was completed on
the 10th of last November. The bonds
soon after being offered for sale at
tracted the attention of Mr. Crocker,
who has a penchant for local invest
ments, but though negotiations were
immediately entered into the trans
action was not consummated until last
Tuesday, Mr. Crocker having taken
the intermediate time to thoroughly
assure himself of the earning capacity
of the road.
Mr. Crocker Is a capitalist who looks
with strong favor on local enterprises,
and where everything is equal always
gives the preference to a home invest
ment when there is one that promises
to be as safe and pay as well as those
away from home.
When seen yesterday regarding this
last big deal of his he said: "The bonds
of the Sierra Railway Company were
strongly recommended to me some time
ago while I was looking around for
something good in which to sink a lit

clination to send money out of Cali

bly.
"I found, after looking into the mat
ter, that the road ran through about
twenty miles of as good farming coun
try as there is in the State, and up to
Jamestown, tapping the mother lode
four miles from Sonora. I further
found that the line had absolutely no
indebtedness, that its earnings for the
three months of its existence were
$39,513 37, which is 14 per cent net on
the bond issue, and that it was only
bonded at $15,000 per mile, while the
Southern Pacific was bonded for $40,
000 and the Valley road for $22,000.
"After assuring myself that this
magnificent showing was no fairy tale,
but well substantiated facts, I imme
diately agreed to take all of the issue
not already sold, and before the deal
was finally closed had already placed
$125,000 worth of the bonds, which are
6 per cent forty-year gold bonds, se
cured by a first mortgage on the road
and its equipments."
Included in the articles of the sale
was an agreement whereby Mr.
Crocker should have two of the five di
rectors. He himself will act as one
director and though he has not yet
finally decided it is more than probable
that the other one will be Maurice
Casey, manager of the McLaughlin es
tate.
Mr. Crocker said last night that he
wished it distinctly stated that the use
of Jesse Lillenthal's name by an
evening paper in connection with this
matter was absolutely unauthorized.
GOOD KLONDIKE LITERATURE.
A New Publication Which Will Be
Welcome to Many Prospective
Miners.
The trite saying, "Of the making of
many books there is no end," has been
frequently exemplified during the past
few months in the flood of Alaskan liter
ature whirh has been literally dumped
upon the marketâ most of it, as a matter
of course, the guesswork of imaginary
explorers of the northern goldfields and
utterly unreliable as to the so-called in
formation exploited.
The latest production in this line, how
ever, bears the Impress of genuine merit
throughout. It is a work beautifully
printe.l in pamphlet form, with fine il
lustrations and carefully prepared de
scriptive matter, under the title, "To the
Klondike rind Alaska Gold Fields," com
piled by Walter B. Cooke for the Alaska
Commercial Company.
This work gives very comprehensive In
formation on the subject treated, and it
is a complete compendium of useful
points for the prospective miner in Alas
ka. It is furnished with an excellent
map of the gold regions of the north and
Showing the different routes by which
they may be reached.
The handy and handsome little volume
is published for free distribution, and
copies may be had at the office of the
Alaska Commercial Company. It bristles
with interesting points for the intending
Klondiker, and will be welcomed by such
as a highly opportune publication.
Imposed on a Woman.
A man named Schweitzer reported to
the police last night that some one had
obtained $5 from his wife on a forged
order, which purported to have been
signed by a friend of the family. He
suspects a young man, who lives on
Eighth street, of having imposed on his
wife. He intends to swear out a war
rant for his arrest.
The thermometer seems to fall six

give an idea of space. Red makes no

ENJOINS SAN
JOSE'S COUNCIL
New Charter Club Pre
vents a Treasury-
Raid.
Stops the Purchase of an Ex
pensive Fire Alarm
System.
Questionable Deal Made by City
Officials Will Be Aired in
Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Feb. s.â President San
ford B. Smith of the New Charter
Club to-day obtained an order from
Judge Kittridge temporarily restrain
ing Mayor Koch and Councilmen Wil
liam T. Nolting. J. P. Fay, George B.
Dittus and Julius Kreig, on the part of
the city, and A. J. Coffee for the United
States Fire and Police Telegraph Com
pany, from entering into a contract for
the purchase of a fire alarm system.
February 14, at 2 p. m., was set as
the time for the defendants to appear
and show cause why the order should
not be made permanent. The order ia
similar to the one obtained on Thurs
day to balk the awarding of a street
sweeping contract that would have
mulcted the city of $12,000 "in three
years.
The petition filed by President Smith
recites that on January 26 the Mayor
and Common Council passed a resolu
tion awarding a contract to A. J. Coffee
for a flre alarm system at a monthly
rental of $65, the city to have the right
to purchase the system at any time
within five years for $3900, less the
amount of rental paid. The Gamewell
Fire Alarm Company put in a bid for
a similar system, its terms being a
rental of $55 a month, the purchase
price to be $3300 if paid within five
years, and the rentals to be credited.
The petition declares that the bid of
said A. J. Coffee is not the lowest and
best bid filed with the Mayor and
Common Council, and that if the con
tract with A. J. Coffee is carried out
the system will cost the city a large
sum for both rental and purchase price
in excess of the amount asked by the
Gamewell Fire Alarm Company, to a
great loss to the taxpayers of the city.
It is set forth that the defendants
threaten, unless restrained by order of
the court, to award and enter into the
contract with A. J. Coflte, to the detri
ment of the city and taxpayers.
The awarding of the contract by the
City Council to A. J. Coffee was a
brazen piece of work. Instead of giv
ing the contract to the lowest bidder
the Council unanimously awarded it
to Coffee at $600 higher than the Game
well bid. A couple of months ago the
Council attempted to give Coffee the
contract for a new fire alarm system
for $2400 without calling for bids. It
found it could not do this, and so called
for bids. Then it turned around and
gave the contract to the highest bid
der. After submitting a price of $2400
to the city for a similar system before
bids were asked Coffee raised his price
to $3900. The system that it was pro
posed to furniph for $2400, with $200
worth of extras, was as good as the
one it proposes to sell the city for
$3900. .Thus the Council deliberately
voted away about $1300 of the people's
money. Rumors on the street have it
that fIOOO of this money was to be dis
pensed where it "would do some good."
The contract is now in the Mayor's
hands and will undoubtedly be vetoed.
Now that the New Charter Club has
taken a hand in straightening out af
fairs it is thought the members of the
Council will lose some of their boldness
and not so freely vote away the peo
ple's money. There seems to be an un
derstanding among them to -spend as
much money as possible during the
next two months they will be in office.
If the restraining nrder obtained to
day does not check them in their ex
travagance it is asserted the New
Charter Club will lose no time In tak
ing steps to impeach them.

Some Incidents of the Children's Day at the Mining Fair.
DELANY IS NOW
AFTER WADHAM
The Captain Charges His
Opponent With Crim
inal Libel.
Has Employed an Attorney to
Interpret the Law in
the Case.
Wadham Declares Himself Ready
for the Ordeal With Reputable
.Witnesses.
Supervisor P. M. Delany has declared
his intention of having E. L. Wadham,
ex-deputy pound keeper, arrested for
criminal libel because of the latter's
utterances regarding the alleged sol
itation to bribe the Health and Police
Committee to allow the public .pound
to remain In the custody of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani
mals.
Supervisor Delany was seen at the
rooms of the Board yesterday and stat
ed that he had evidence sworn to in
affidavits that Wadham's charges were
false, and that the ex-driver of the
wagon had maliciously misrepresented
the facts.
"The Finance Committee may drop j
this matter," he said, " but I shall not. ,
"Wadham, In his efforts to throw mud j
on me, has gone beyond the limit that j
the law allows, and I shall have him
held responsible before the courts. I j
have employed an attorneyâ one of the
best In the townâ to ascertain whether j
a crime has been committed, and I am ,
Informed that such is the fact. If
there is any justice in the law I shall
obtain it before this matter ends."
When informed last evening of Su- |
pervisor Delany's intention to have him i
arrested for criminal libel, Mr. Wad- j
ham expressed the greatest surprise.
"I did not think he had the courage to ;
even dare do a thin? like that," Mr.
Wadham said. "Why, if he was to ever
bring this matter into court, he would j
get the worst raking over that he ever
received In his life. I can prove cv- I
erything I said of him, and what is
-more, people are coming to me and vol
unteering information about the man. !
Within a day or two I will have fur
ther testimony of his receiving money '
from other sources.
"If he is to be backed up in his case
by the class of men who appeared at
the Supervisors' meeting on Friday
evening there is no do-Ã¼bt in my mind
that 1 will be acquitted, as I consider
those men are unworthy of belief.
Take, for instance, that man Gilfeath- I
er. Why, he has been a frequenter of ;
the police courts so often that he has
â  become nearly as well known as the i
judges on the bench. His testimony in
regard to my having sold a dog to ;
Beruardi and then p<rcketed the money
is false, and I intend to have him ar
rested on Monday lor saying so. My '
books will bear me out that the money
was turned into the society, and I will
make him suffer for his perjury.
"Another sample witness was A. A. ,
Friedlander. 1 suppose he is looking
tor some future favor from Delany, and ;
therefore appeared before the Super- :
visors. He in known throughout the
City .Hall. My X"ing on the Nicholls j
woman's bonii was done as a favor to
Charley Nagle. He met me in the hall !
and asked me to, and to accommodate
him I qualified. The woman offered me
two dollars' and a half for doing so, but
I refused to accept it. Friedlander was
also on the bond at the time and did
not refuse the money that was offered
me. That is ray only knowledge of her,
and I deny strenuously that I ever ca- j
roused around with her, as he charges, i
Mr. Nagle will bear me out on this
point.
"Through ignorance of J. W. Bird's |
reputatien J agreed to accojanjjnjr hmi
to court and support him in his endeav
or to be made guardian over a girl who
! was living in his house. Judge Slack re
fused to appoint him.
"There was no truth in the testimony
; given by George Delmer. He appeared
i before the board out of pure spite.
: That man was dropped from the so-
I ciety on account of the many com
, plaints mad? against him. I deny that
| I ever met Delmer or ever had any con-
I versation with him.
"What surprised me more than any-
I thing else was Frank Holbrook going
;on the stand. He is a brother of the
present secretary of the society, and
everything has been done by the latter
to keep him in good condition. All the
positions he ever occupied was through
j his brother Charles, and now he turns
| around and charges us with starving
our cattle. When he was employed out
here there seemed to be sufficient feed,
, as he would come over in the evening
for a bucket of meat to feed his dogs.
He has been away from home for three
days at a time.
"Now if any court will believe the
j testimony of these men against repu
j table citizens I will be more surprised
than the news of Delany's suit against
me for criminal libel.
"As to the charge of my being an
associate of Oliver Winthrop. I can
only reiterate that I never knew the
man, never saw him and never had a
'â  word with him in my life. I have never
; had any dealings with Kelly and Crim
! mins, as was testified to. I have re
| peatedly heard of them, but never
! came in contact with them."
Ex-Poundmaster F. A. Osborn will
be called upon by the Society for the
; Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to
j account for two hundred dollars due
the society when he retired. He will
! also be asked to account for a seventy
: dollar Mexican saddle and a fourteen
: dollar bridle that he is said to have
i purchased with the funds of the so
! ciety. Attorney Martin Stevens has
i been instructed to commence suit to
\ morrow if the money is not refunded.
Osborn tried to explain its disap
j pearance to Mr. Holbrook on his re
. tirement by stating that he had ex
| changed the saddle and bridle for a
j horse, and as he had turned the animal
' over to the society he thought he was
square on that score.

chance to prove that he is entitled to rec
ognition among the pugilists who are rat

Graney, Choynski and Sharkey will

STRICKEN DOWN
IN A MOMENT
J. C. Johnson, Capitalist,
Dropped Dead Last
Evening.
While Walking on the Street
With His Nephew the
End Came.
The Body Was Removed to the Late
Residence by Friends and
Relatives.
J. C. Johnson, the capitalist and well
known business man of this city, and
who lived with his nieces at California
street and Van Ness avenue, Cropped
dead last evening at Certtral avenue
and California streets. He was .accom
panied by his nephew, Fred S. Jcrhn
son, treasurer and manager of the firm
of J. C. Johnson & Co., importers and
manufacturers of saddlery and har
ness, and his niece, who was living
with the deceased.
Early in the evening the party took
dinner in a restaurant on Central ave
nue and California street, and while
walking from the place the deceased
was seen to throw up his hands and
after turning partly around he fell to
the sidewalk and was picked up dead.
The body was removed to his. late resi
dence, where it is at present surround
ed by the relatives.
J. C. Johnson was the president of the
Johnson Manufacturing Company
which dealt in saddlery and harness
and was respected by his business as
sociates for his honesty and business
principles. A large circle of friends
will be shocked at his sudden death.
Drs. Anderson and Thorn were hur
riedly called and gave their opinion
that- death came from a diseased heart.
It was at first thought that apoplexy
was the cause, but the relatives stated
that the deceased had frequently com
plained of a severe pain in the region
of the heart;
FAVOR ELECTION.
School Teachers Express Their Ideas
Regarding School Directors.
Principal Joseph O'Connor of the School
Department completed yesterday the tab
ulation of the vote of the school teachers
as to whether the Board of Education
should be elected or appointed. Mr.
O'Connor is the chairman of the educa
tional committee of the Board of Free
holders, and was intrusted with the task
of compiling the figures.
His tally shows that 559 teachers voted
in favor of an elective board and that 304
thought the body should be appointed.
Three teachers thought that the board
should be composed of six appointive and
six elective directors. The average num
ber of directors desired by the teachers
was nine.
Express Best of Thanks.
Mr. G. F. Ochs, late of the Indianapolis
' Furniture Company, now partner with
j the Pattosien Company, Sixteenth and
! Mission, expresses his thanks to his many
) friends who have called. Mr. Ochs states
i it 1b the truth that the furniture sells at
I least 20 per cent less than it sold "down
town. Brussels carpets go at 60 cents a
yard. Cheap rent accounts for it. â¢
Selling Liquor to Indians.
Smith Card and Oliver Calkins, who
pleaded guilty to indictments charging
them with selling liquor to Indians of the

FRANCIS SMITH & CO.'S
INTERESTING EXHIBIT.
One of the Most Striking Displays
to Be Seen at the Mining
Fair.
Probably the most interesting exhibit
at the Mining Fair is the actual repre
sentation of hydrauli'-king in the North
Bloomfield Gravel Mine, in Nevada
County, to be seen at the extreme west
ern end of the pavilion upstairs. The
sheet iron riveted pipe, used in this rep.
resentation, is from the works of Fran
cis Smith & Co., 130 Beale street, which
company was established fcrrty-three
years ago at North San Juan, Nevada
County, by Francis Smith, and he it
was who constructed the first line of
riveted sheet iron pipe used for hy
draulicking purposes in California, and
the line of pipe, 1800 feet long, is in use
to-day.
A piece of double riveted sheet iron
pipe. No. 16 iron, manufactured by
Francis Smith in 1872 was taken up
after being in constant use for twenty
one years, under a pressure of 150 feet,
at the Santa Barbara "Water Works,
Exhibit of Francis Smith & Co.
and to-day Bhows very little sign of
wear.
The superintendent of the San Mateo
Water Works, unsolicited, lately sent
a piece of pipe laid by this firm in July,
1865. It was of No. 14 Iron, and had
been subjected to a pressure of 175 feet,
and is in a remarkably good state of j
preservatk.-n, as also is a piece cut from i
a pipe laid at North San Juan by Fran- ;
cis Smith in 1859.
These examples are quoted to show
the quality of the work turned out by
the linn, who to-day are better pre
pared, with increased facilities and the
matt skilled workmen, to manufacture
feheet iron and steel pipe of any size, j
and to undertake contracts of any mag
nitude and execute them In short or
der and in the highest state of perfec- j
tion. They make pipe not only for I
mining purposes, but for town water ;
supply systems, power plants, electrical
transmission, irrigation and well pur- i
poses.
They have furnished the pipe system
for the principal water companies on
the Pacific Coast, and are now manu- j
facturing a plant for a new system of j
gravel washing in Idaho, at their ex- |
tensive plant in San Leandro, where
they fulfill extra large contracts. Four
years ago they made a string of twen
ty-two miles of 30-inch sheet iron pipe
for the Oakland Water Company, which
has given thorough satisfaction, and,
although in constant use day and
! night, pumping water under a pressure
j of 100 pounds to square inch, has need
!ed no repairs whatever. The principal
feature of their pipe is the coal tar and
asphaltum coating to which it is sub
jected, thus preserving the pipe against
rust.
Francis Smith & Co. also make a spe
j cialty of hydraulic giants, water gates,
distributors and all necessary appli
ances for a complete mining water sys
tem or power plants, and they are thor
oughly competent to give advice as to
the weights and sizes of the pipe re
ciuired and the construction necessary.
THE CHILDREN
WERE THERE
By Hundreds and Thou
sands They Visited
the Fair.
Barrels of Candy Were Given
Away to Them by the
Management.
The German Choral Societies Will
Sing This Even
ing.
When the doors of the Mechanics'
Pavilion at the Mining Fair were
thrown open yesterday, there arose soft
and clear, above the noise of the ma
chinery within and the roar of the
streets without, magical and melodious
notes of weird music. It is said that
they fell from the far-famed reed of
the Pied Piper of Hamlin. Just how
the management secured the services
of this mythical musician of fairyland
or where they had him hidden is not
known, but certain it is that when the
music was heard a vast army of chil
dren came trooping and dancing from
all directions.
First by ones and twos, but quickly
the infantile stream of glad and happy
humanity grew to hundreds and thou"
sands. There were girls and boys of all
ages, sizes and kinds. Soon the main
entrance of the pavilion was jammed
like the vortex of a mighty funnel, with
the clamoring, pushing and struggling
mass of little ones. Just inside the en
trance were countless numbers of bar
rels filled with bags of candy, and over
8000 of these were given away. Each
girl and boy were made happy in the
possession of a bag of the sweets, and
the thousand teachers were not forgot
ten.
Once on the inside the children pro
ceeded to take immediate possession of
the entire pavilion. They took in all
the exhibits, passed .by hundreds
through the tunnel, visited the horse
show, the art gallery and the moving
pictures. With their little eyes and
ears wide open, they saw and heard
all that there was to see and hear with
in the four walls of the pavilion.
At 2 o'clock the band struck up a
lively march, and there was at once a
rush for the band stand. Every avail
able inch of space surrounding it was
occupied, and in a moment the galler
ies were crowded to overflowing. With
the beginning of the programme the
small visitors' wonder and admiration
knew no bounds. They laughed and
shouted, and generously clapped their
hands at all they witnessed.
First came "John and Johnnie," the
trained bears, in their unrivaled antics,
and loud was the applause that greet
ed them. Next followed an up-to-date
cake walk by little Miss Ribble Klrby
Butler and Master Harry Mangles.
These infantile wonders are aged 5 and
6 years, respectively. They wore cos
tumes (rt the Louis Quinze period, and
did their dance with all the grace and
ease of their professional elders. At its
conclusion they were each presented
with a cake so large that they could
not carry it. Mephisto, the marvel
ous King of Fire, next mystified his
youthful audience by eating living and
burning flames. The popcorn eating
contest between the small boys was ex
tremely funny.
The children made a "ala day of it,
and when it came time for them to
leave they turned from the scenes of
pleasure with reluctant steps, only $&
take away with them pleasant rrfemo
ries of a pleasant day. So successful
was the children's day that the man
agement is going to repeat it on next
Saturday.
Despite the inclement weather, there
was no diminishing in the attendance
upon the fair last night. The after-
noon programme was repeated, bu* the
special feature of the evening was the
rendering by Bennett's band, by re
quest, of the "Miserere," II Trovatore
(Verdi). The artistic treatment of this
masterpiece was received with the
wildest applause, and it had to be re
peated before the audience was satis
fled. The cornet and trombone solos
were sustained by Messrs. Rogers and
I in. The theme proper was devel-
I with that perfect regard for time
phrasing that add so materially to
culmination of its difficult finale,
lis afternoon the fair will be open
he pudlic and there will be a grand
ed concert by the band. To-night
be German niffht. and there will
bur numbers rendered by the Ger
i choral societies of the city. Over
hundred persons will be in the
â¢us, and a rare musical feast is
promised. Another special feature to
night will be the rendering hy the band
of Schubert's Symphony in B minor.
Only the first movement will he given.

An "Astral Guest" Appears Before a Meeting of Occulists
Strange Scenes at a
91}(dnight SatAer/ny
of Jidepfe.
HOW I obtained permission to
Join the party is immaterial:
that I did obtain it is the im
portant fact, and having dona
so I was obliged to fall in with
existing arrangements and submit to
the- conditions imposed, which were
that I should go alone at night to the
secret place of meeting and should
leave at the very instant that I vg&s
signaled to do so.
I had enrolled myself in the ranks of
occultist students, and ap a special fa
vor and a foretaste of higher things to
follow I was to be permitted to attend
the initial portion of one of tha secret
meetings of the order.
So it was that I found myself one
e\'ening last week standing alone on the
deserted platform of the San Rafael
railn>a<J station twenty-five miles from
my own favorite restaurant, with the
local train disappearing in the distance.
It was twenty minutes past eleven,
and I was alone in an unfamiliar place,
bound on the strangest adventure of
my life. It was a chill night, with a
sky full of lowering rain-laden clouds,
through which the moon now and then
glanced indifferently. I shivered, turned
up my coat collar and the bottoms of
my trousers and started down the
muddy road which I had been directed
to follow till I should be picked up.
It is awfully still in the country be
tween eleven and twelve at night, and
.t was almost opaquely dark under the j
shadow of the trees; but I plowed along
as best I could until I pearly ran over, j
or was nearly run over by, a horse at- I
tached to what I discovered by the
licht of a match to be a mud-bespat
tered family carriage and .driven by a
man who looked as if he were wrapped '
up for a winter expedition in the Klon
dike
"Are you going there?" demanded a
Voice fn>m the mass of garments. My
affirmative ansv.'er was followed by a
curt order to "get in." I obeyed. The
equipage was turned sharply about and
in a short time I alighted before a
large, rambling house which, surround
ed by trees, set some little distance
back from the road, and, having no
gleam of light visible from the front,
presented a most decidedly gloomy ap
pearance.
The servitor of many clothes and few
words preceded me up the steps and
opened the door into an unlighted and
chilly hall.
"Door to the left at the lower end,"
he said; then closed the portal behind
me and left me to my fate.
â  â â¢â  the host of the occasion had de
ci'lecl to have no lights I felt that I
must not invoke even the feeble as
nre of a match. I. had been ex
pressly charged not to interfere in any
way with existing conditions, therefore
I felt along the wall carefully, skated
one foot out experimentally and then
the other, and at last reached the wall
at the further end of the hallway. My
hand was on the knob of the door when
from within the room a voice suddenly
rose, clear, resonant, unmodulated, re
. citing in a measured chant which knew
no change of tone nor rhythmical im
pulse, some sentences with which my
amateurish occult studies had made
me familiar.
"The thorough understanding of self
Is the beginning of all real knowledge,"
said the voice. "Widen your thoughts
and dissolve your personality. To seek
after the truth which a thing repre
sents means to conjure its spirit. To
recognize the character of a thing with
all its various attributes means to see
its spirit. To know how to use all the
powers that are hidden in a thing ie to
make its spirit subservient to your
power. If I know the attributes of a
thing I "know its spirit. If I cnn make
use of the qualities of a thing its spirit
will be my servant. To understand a
thing thoroughly is to imagine to be it.
"While the body sleeps the soul may
go to different places and act intelli
gently there. Wherever consciousness
is there you axe. Concentrate your
mind, meditate upon that which you
Wish to know and so learn."
Silence followed. After a moment's
pause I opened the door quietly.
I saw a large room bare of the usual
draperies. There was no carpet, no
rugs, no soft curtains or portieres.
There were a number of hard-seated
chairs set stiffly back against the wall,
and seven similar ones were arranged
in a slightly curving line facing to
ward, but a little distance removed
from the wood fire which was blazing
on the hearth and furnished the only
illumination of the apartment.
Six of these seats were occupied, but
the seventh was vacant. As I hail
previously been instructed I slipped
into it without going through the for
mality of waiting for greeting or wel
come. No one appeared to notice my
advent; the six men present sat silent
and motionless, gazing straight before
them, apparently engrossed with their
own thoughts.
They sat with their legs horizontal
to the knees, then perpendicular to the
Boor, their bodies erect, and their hands
resting lightly on their kneesâ the posi
tion giving freest circulation to what
is known as the "perpendicular cur
rents."'
One of them was the young profes- j
sor, a recent arrival on the coast, .
whose claim to be a supreme lnstruc- j
tor of the American Order of Occultists i
I had already seen substantiated to ;
some degree by various mysterious eso- j
teric phenomena. He has the pale face, !
the tired eyes and the slender physique
of a student, and he looked less of the
earth and more of the spirit than us- j
ual even, in a flowing robe which lent j
a certain grave dignity to his appear- j
ance and manner.
Next him was a keen-faced business
man whom I should never have sus
pected of having any inclination to
dabble with occult things. A lawyer
and a physician were in the line, also a
retired capitalist who is said to spend
a good deal erf his money in trying to
find out things that few know. Our
host, who is a novice like myself, made
up the required odd number.
Finding it impossible to concentrate
my mind as my companions were evi
dently endeavoring to do, I gazed
about me curiously, but covertly. By
the nickering light of the fire, which at
no time burned brightly, and some
times seemed on the point of going out
entirely, I saw that the five sacred col
ors, the prismatic hues, were arranged
in the way prescribed by the founders
of the order, and that all the various
conditions of material arrangement
had been complied with as far as possi
ble under the circumstances.
I glanced sidewise at the faces of my
companions and became Instantly con
scious that my curiosity was a disturb
ing element. The man next to me
stirred uneasily and the professor
looked in my direction with a sad-eyed
blankness which was a mute reproach.
I tried to forget everything but .ray
mission, and to "concentrate and medi
tate" as I had been told to do. It was
an effort at first, but by resolutely
turning my thoughts inward I soon be
came conscious of a singular change in
my attitude of mind. From being
merely curious I became receptive and
expectant. I no longer wondered It any
thing strange was to occtrr; t simply
waited for events and accepted them
as they came. The fire died down al
most to darkness, and we still sat
silent, at peace with ourselves and our
surroundings.
There was a soft vibration in the air.
My companions were breathing in con
cert the mystic words which create the
waves of atmosphere and thought and
â will most to be desired at such meet
ings. I joined with them as best I
could and had only been breathing the
soft sounds for a few minutes when
between us and the fire there fell, ap
parently from above, a shower of glow
ing points of light, which disappeared
before they reached the floor.
A moment later and a tiny ball of
luminosityâ it could not be called defi
nite and aggressive light â arose wav
eringly from the boards at our feet,
and. like a ball of incandescent thistle
down, floated uncertainly before us,
higher and higher, until it, too, disap
peared in the dense darkness which
seemed to hover over our heads like a
cloud.
I turned my eyes toward the pro
fessor and saw without astonishment
that his face stood out in strong relief
against the background of brooding
shadow which surrounded us, as if
some light from within faintly shone
through it, making it visible by its own
soft glow. The other faces I could see
but dimly; his seemed the central point
of the whole gathering.
The atmospherical vibrations in
creased in intensity until a faint trem
ulou.sness in unison with them thrilled
through my whole system. I felt as If
my breath were deserting me, or rather
as if I were becoming capable of exist
ing without breath.
I felt as if I were lifted up in some
mysterious way which seemed, how
ever, quite natural and simple at the
time, far above everything that I had
ever known or felt or thought, and
then, as from an immeasurable dis
tance, I heard the sound of what
seemed a chime of fairy bells. Clear,
sweet, but scarcely loud enough to
more than suggest themselves upon the
air they rang but for a momentâ a lit
tle fall of musical raindrops, as it were
âand then silence settled about us once
again.
We had heard the "astral bells" and
as the sounds died into the stillness j
that had scarcely been disturbed we j
all rose and bowed" our heads. To the i
occultist this is the signal that all con- i
ditions are right for the presentation
of such mysteries as may be accorded. '
The shadow that had hovered over I
us drew aside and settled like a screen I
on the eastern wall. Bits of light like !
luminous snowfiakes floated over its I
surface, increasing in number and-bril- j
llancy, as they gathered toward the
center, forming a shining cloud which

paled and glowed and then separated'
into sharply denned letters. A sen
tence written in cramped characters'
and in to me an unknown language
shone out clearly before us.
"It is a greeting from the Master,"
said the professor reverently.
We rose again and bowed to the mys
tery which the absent mind had sent
as his contribution to our meeting, and
as we gazed upon the message the lines
became iiv _ net and uncertain, and
finally col t -d themselves into the
shining clot again.
Our director extended his hand in
token that we were to remain standing
and silent and concentrate our minds
on the nebulous brightness before us.
It remained stationary as to place, but
was full of Internal motion like super
heated air, shimmering arid shivering,
and by degrees changing its form from
the horizontal to the perpendicular as
it increased in size and density.
At last it rested, a column of light
with its base on the floor, and then, as
if scales had fallen from my eyes, I
saw that it had resolved itself into the
semblance, or rather the actual ethe
reaiized personality of a man.
He was an old man with a long beard
and a slight stoop in his shoulders, and
he was dressed in the flowing robes of
the far East. His hair and beard and
garments were of the silvery gray of
a fog bank upon which the sun is shin
ing, but otherwise there was nothing
ghostlike or abnormal about him.
He looked at us with steady, kindly
eyes and smiled at us in grave, pater
nal fashion, making a graceful Orien
tal gesture of salutation as he did so,
but he did not speak nor move toward
us.
He stood reposeful and waiting, a
faint shadow of question on his hand
some, strongly marked face, and the
professor, looking down the line, made
a slight but imperative gesture to the
other novice and myself.
It meant dismissal. When we were
granted the rare permission of attend
ing the meeting it had been agreed that
we should instantly depart on the ap
pearance of the visitor. But we had
been promised greater sights in these
mysteries when we became more ad
vanced in the learning of the order. We
had already been permitted to see more
than any other newcomers Into the
ranks of the occultists, and we went
out softly into the darkness of the hall
and left those who had a right to re
main in the presence of their astral
guest. REUBEN TAYLOR.
TWO BROTHERS.
Here is the story of two brothers who
stuck to one another through life, and
in death were not divided. They were
past 60 years of age, and, being report
ed ill and destitute in the old house
where they lived alone,- were removed
to Bellevue Hospital. Each, though
helpless, was anxious to take care of
the other. When asked if they had any
friends, both gave the same reply: "The
best friend I have in the world Is my
brother here."
On thr :r cots side by side they lay dy
ing, yet neither appeared to have any
thought of his own suffering, but asked
continually that something be done for
his brother. The elder one died first,
saying: "Good-by, John, dear. God
bless you!" Less than four hours after
this farewell John breathed his last.
The next day â it was the day after
Christmas â the two brothers lay side
by side in the Morgue, where an aged
woman, who had been their friend,
came and identified the bodies, promis
ing to notify relatives who would see
that they were buried together.
Such is a real incident from the great
epic of daily life in the metropolis, and
it points its moral better than aome fic
tion. â Leslie's "Weekly.

Most peojile, wish to read it in the light
of supernatural communication. I
have nonobjection to that method if
desired er.d be reached, which is,
to make Scripture the teacher of the
emotions, an , instructor of virtue and
an interpreter of the relationship be
tween the divine and man.
If this much be sought in the Bible
most â ! find something in it to

that appeals ni' si strongly to our hu
manlty. Its simple accounts of the
our forefathers, its bold
denunciation of the evil in man,
and its tender commendation of

is still capable of the greatest improve

charm of Its Inspiration, which, by the

To tret, the best, ethically, out of

who hopes to grow stronger and

is but one of the many sides of the
wonderful book. Its strongest, Its no

Fir his si mi! the deep influence of the
Bible's noble oratory upon the moral
; 58 of the world.
To the student a line of Isaiah is
worth a hundred Iliads, and the com
forting sophisms of Job are far more
il than the keenest dialectics of
.:s and Arabs. He reads the his
tory of the world and the beginning of
tilings; and he marvels, because the
evolution of man and his physical po
tencies are nowhere so strongly depicted
as in the book of books. And thus the
student receives a lasting impression
that God is great and good:
A Jew finds it somewhat difficult to
answer a query concerning the gospels.
Theologically, Israel knows n. "thing of
them; ethically, they are modifications
of Talmudic and Medrashic maxims.
The writers of the gospels reflected the
wisdom of the rabbis of their times.
From a student's standpoint I will say
that it is only in this sense that the
gospels have any interest for me.
As a teacher of religion and one who
must necessarily be interested in soci
ety's moral and intellectual progress I
will venture to say that if the Chris
tian world will ever reach the standard
<>f the ideality pr-t up in the gospels
there will be little cause tor asking
questions like this. Let the Christian
world strive to reach the ideal; let its
practices be in complete harmony with
irs professions of peace and good will,
faith, hope and charity: and if we ever
reach that far in God's eternal years
rabbi and priest will minister at the
same altar â in the same shrine of God.

tures, called the
Bible, can be

only by proving
that there is within the letter another
meaning, which treats of God and spir
itual things.
Jewish history, ns such, is no more
God's word than Roman or Persian his
tory, and unless It can be shown that
the places, persons, countries and times,
and all natural objects in the Bible
are symbols of the spiritual principles
of love and wisdom, which God is, it
cannot be God's word.
When these symbols are understood
as pertaining to principles instead of
persons; to states of mind and heart
instead of times, and qualities of good
or evil instead of place, then God is re
vealed to us, as never before. God's
of nature will then be found to
be corresporudentfal to his written book
of symbols, which employs all the ob
jects ..f nature to express spiritual
Things. The Gospels and Book of Rev
elation have this inner meaning in its
fu'lo.st expression.
Instead of going back to ancient
manuscripts or church to prove the au
thority of the word, we would simply
ask any one to apply the same reason-
Ing he would apply to a mathematical
proposition. Instead, however, having
points, lir.^s and angles and figures to
deal with, hfÂ» will from certain axiom
atic spiritual principles proceed to
demonstrate the truth of propositions
which deal with the higher forces of
life, love, wisdom and their reception
and application by angels and men.
Thus the Bible is seen to be holy be
cause it treats of the highest and holi
est things. "The letter killeth, but the
spirit giveth life." No criticism of the
letter as to time, place or person can
destroy or disturb the prophetical his
torical and gospel parable.
The central figure of the Gospel
Jesus Christ, when seen from the spir
itual principles which th*-se names sig
nify, id Been to be divine. Otherwise

In the humanity, that is, the human

â  r.h the father. In which consists
the true atonement, and salvation is to
be saved by the abiding presence of

It includes the education of humanity
from childhood to manhood. It seems
to me that to read the Bible intelli/
gently and earnestly we need some
such view of its contents and idea.
When we read the first chapter of Gen

which it was written and recognize in
the crude science of that time the su

and ruler of this universe. That is the
truth, and nÂ«> lesson, of geology.
The Bible is sometimes called the
Word of God. It contains a word of
God, and much that is not in any
proper sense a word of God. The
different books of the Bible have
different value, and are to be regard
ed and read with discrimination. The
Proverbs of Solomon, whether he wrote
them or not, are not to be compared
with the Sermon on the Mount, nor the
story of Samson with the letters of
Paul.
It is common to say that the Bible is
inspired. We want an intelligent idea
of what that means if we would read
the spiritual import of the Bible.
Does it mean a theography, a writ
ing by the hand of God himself? or a
writing by men to whom' the spirit of
God had given understanding? The
test of inspiration is that it inspires,
lifts up the mind, exalts the feeling,
kindles imagination.
Solomon says: "He that passeth by
and meddleth with strife belonging not
to him is like one that.taketh a dog
by the ears." John says: "Beloved,
now are we the sons of God, and it doth
not yet appear what we shall be; but
we know that when he shall appear we
shall be like him."
Here are two styles of writing. Which
is inspired and which inspiring?
I know of no book from which so
much can be gained by the common
heart, and which at the same time af
fords and demands such exercise- of
reason and intelligence. The Bible is
the classic literature of our religion.
Like all other classic literature its per
fection is relative. As it becomes old
and older it becomes also ' in many
points o-f view^ strange to the thought
and tas*te of the generations that study
it. It is found necessary to make al
lowance for the time, the circum
stances, the historical events in which
the literature arose. All the writings
of the Bible are to be Judged in rela
tion to the age in which they were
written. The eternal things are per
petual from age to age, but much has
no relation to the modern times.
The word unto the prophet spoken
Was writ on tables yet unbroken;
The word by seers or sibyl told
In groves of oak or fanes of gold
Still floats upon the morning wind
Still whispers to the willing mind-
One accent of the Holy Ghost
The heedless world has never lost.

which seem to others difficult, if not im

We believe that the Holy Scriptures
of the Old Testament were given by in
spiration of God, contain a full revela
tion of his will to man, are inerrant,
and are the only Infallible rule of faith
and practice. We read the Bible with
perfect faith, sure that all prophecies
have been, are being and will be ful
filled, and in this spirit only can the
best good be secured from it.
Mrs. White, the well-known Advent

New is but the unfolding of the Old. Let
.those who talk of the patriarchal and
prophetic age as a Christless age read
their Bibles with humble heart, pray
ing for power to follow the example of
the holy men of God."
We believe in the divinity of Jesus.
In the summary of our faith these
words occur: "There is one Lord, Jesus
Christ, the son of the eternal Father,
the one by whom he created all things,
and by whom they do exist." We look
upon him as our Savior and Redeemer,
and expect to reign with Him in time
to come.

of Adelina Patti and Ernesto Nicolini.
That it lasted to the very endâ till

them togetherâ was shown in Patti's
devotion to Nicolini during his last ill

the end came she was his constant and

when professional engagements which

the wife of the Marquis de Caux. her

for an opera tenor required certain sac

At first there were guarded whispers
in private circles in regard to her rela

of the bigot and, fanatic, or through
that of the cynic and skeptic, the out
come of such reading is in both in
stances error.
It must be remembered that its con
tents are all stro-ngly marked with the
exaggeration to say that from that day
until his death Nicolini continued the
same ardent Romeo to his Juliet.
As a rule, where there is trouble be
tween a famous stage character and
her husband, especially when he is
merely a "prima donna's husband," the
public is apt to sympathize with the
woman, but in Patti's case it was dif
ferent. Owing to the Marquis de
("aux's social position and the intiuem-e
he was able to bring to bear, she was
obliged to endure much obloquy.
Moreover, she was not only married
herself, butNicolini also had a wife and
children. The papers referred to him
as "the gentleman who now travels
about with Mme. Patti," and certain
practical jokers got out invitations to
her alleged coming wedding with the
tenor. At St. Petersburg there was a
scene between her and the Marquis,
and the women of the higher social
circles showed their disapproval of her
action by either leaving- their boxes or
drawing the curtains when she appear
ed upon the stage.

oriental mysticism and allegory. Also
that it remained for' years in the hands
of a conservative body of men, who
mutilated, altered and interpreted to
suit their own aggrandizement before it
became common property through be
ing translated into the vulgar tongue.
Realizing, too, that it was translated
by men whose knowledge of the lan
guage in which it was written was at
least questionable, it may be reasona
bly contended that the accepted Bible
of to-day is widely different from its
great original.
That its contents were originally in
spired we may believe, that is, inspired
in the sense that its writers wrote un
der the control of spirit power, and
this fact alone will account for contra
dictions and discrepancies in it. Dif
ferent spirit controls give different in
spirations, hence there Will always be
a certain amount of contradiction in in
spired utterances and writings.
The spirit controls inspired their me
diums according to- their, the spirits')
knowledge and advancement. From
this it will be evident that the value
of an inspiration is to be ascertained
only by the evidence it presents of
truth and goodness.
An inspiration may come from a con
trol that is evil and wicked, and this
the Bible clearly indicates when it
states that God sent a "lying spirit" to
so far as to include her admiration for
his singing, which shows love is not
only blind, but sometimes also deaf.
Nicolini was never, even in his best
days, a great tenor, and however pleas
ing his voice may have been when
Patti first met him, it is certain that
when she brought him over here on a
concert tour in ISBI the sacred fire, if
it had ever burned within him, was not
observable, and he was already, from
a vocal point of view, a good deal of an
extinct volcano.
Now, her insistence chat he should
always be engaged by managers to sing
with her may have been a matter of
business, but there was plenty of evi
dence to show that she really enjoyed
his voice. I remember that during one
of her visits here Nicolini, who was a
collector of rare violins, bought a Paolo
Magini. Three or four of his musical
friends happened to drop in at the
Windsor Hotel to see him that day,
and he began showing off his purchase.
This resulted in a little impromptu
musicale, during which Xicolini sang
the "Salve Dimorah" from Gounod's
"Faust." Shortly afterward Patti
came into the room, and when she
heard that he had been singing gave
him quite a little scolding, in her
own charming way, of course, for not
having sent for her to hear him.
No one could lons be in Patti's en
tourage without observing the mutual
devotion between her and Nicolini, and
this continued not only durirrg the pe
riod of ten years when their relations
were more romantic than legal, but
also after they were formally married
in 1886.
To him she was not only the one star
of the operatic stage but the one star
of his life. He was not only her devot
ed admirer but he also paid attention
to her many pets. She traveled around
with a regular train of these â dosrs.
parrots, mocking birds and canaries.
Noticing that day on the steamboat a
man who was carrying a cage rather
carelessly, Nicolini ran over to him
with the exclamation. "Prenez garde,
monsieur, c'est le Prince!" Prince was
a dove colored parrtit of which lime,
Patti was especially fond.
One of th 9 features in Patti's career
has been the physical care which she
has always taken of herself in order
that her voice might remain unimpair
ed as long as possible. Much of this
care was due to Nicolini's caution. He
watched over her regime almost like
a physician. He would not allow her
to speak in the morning until she had
had a cup of chocolate, which he often
prepared with his own hands.
The days when she was to sing he
did not allow her to raise hor voice
above a whisper, and he often cooked
little dishes for her himself, especially
her after opera suppers, to make sure
that they did not contain too much fat
and that they were in other ways just
suited to her taste. And although
these devotions extended over so many
years she always seemed to find a new
charm in them.

mislead the prophet and the people.
Therefore it may given as the general
opinion of thoughtful spiritualists that
the writings of the Bible were produced
under inspiration, and that those writ
ings must be read honestly and fairly,
and judged according to their intrinsic
merits â accepting the good as emanat
ing from good controls and the bad
from evil ones.
If the character of Jesus Christ be
regarded as the character of a god, It
falls short of the most perfect ideal;
if It be regarded as that of a man, a re
former and a martyr, who gave his Ufa
as a forfeit to savage bigotry and Igno
rance, it presents a splendid human, a
transeendently beautiful man â a sym
bol of love and kindness, of meekness
and gentleness, of justice and charity.
Jesus of Nazareth was the greatest
spirit medium the world ever saw â a
healing medium and an inspired orator
controlled by good and powerful spirits
of the highest order. Little understood
by the barbarians around him and act
ing as the master of a lodge or spiritual
circle, he performed his good work and
miracles openly, and honestly striving
to elevate mankind and using his me
diumship to eradicate error, reform
bigotry and relieve suffering humanity.
In return for this he suffered persecu
tion, misrepresentation, injustice, cru
elty and eventually death.

We should come to it with faith.
I know it is sometimes asked," Why
should we not have a new religion?
There have been 1800 years of research
since the Bible was sealed with a finis.
Must these go for nothing? Are we
not wiser than our fathers respecting
the great verities? Is it not high time
that our faith should be brought up
abreast with the.zeit â the spirit
of the time? * ,â 
But there are some things in "which
the fashion never changesfundamen
tal things, like air and water and sun
shine. , May not relig^nâ nay, must
not' religionâ of this sort? Charcoal
and diamond are both essentially the
same they are carbon ; they differ only
in the fact that the charcoal was made
yesterday, while diamonds have been
under pressure for ages. Current opin
ions are loose charcoal; the Apostles'
Creed, the best formula outside of the
Bible of the, faith once delivered to the
saints, is a solitaire.
Because we can mend a goosequill

mend an eagle's wing. There is that
oft quoted and . flippant couplet of
Pope: . . :S\C:
For modes of faith let graceless bigots
fight:
He can't be wrong whose life is in the
right.
As though there is no well ascertain
ed ground, no standard of Christian
belief; as though there were not some
things settled by revelation and ex
perience once and forever; as though
the roots of characterâ belief had no re
lation to the fruits of character â
duct and life.
Again in matters of science, men are
not forever seeking the truth and never
finding it. They do find it. and when
they find it they crystallize it into ax
ioms, corollaries and definitions, which
have been hammered out after years of
toil and research, and which are used
when formulated In .findings further
truth.
Why, then, in matters of religion that
touch character and destiny shall we
not be able to lay our hands on certain
great verities which are no longer open
questions, and say without a doubt or
a misgiving, "I believe them"?
What is the most helpfuland uplift

gospels?
As the living Christ. Matthew Ar

Now he is deau; far hence he lies.
In that lone Syrian town.
And on his grave with kindly eyes
The .Syrian stars look down.
And Mrs. Humphry Ward, following
Renan, calls the story of the resurrec
tion "an exquisite fable."
But nineteen centuries of Christian
history are not built upon a ghost story,
nor the fairest civilizations the world
saw upon an optical illusion. Millions
of transformed lives are not based upon
a fog bank, or upon Mary's mistaking
a patch of moonlight for her risen
Lord.
That is why upon the ruins of the
ancient faiths has been reared the
Christian church, dominant in Europe
and America and girdling the globe
with its missionary enterprises. The
church lives and grows to-day because
behind its sacraments and rituals, be
hind its creeds and confessions of
faith, behind its chapels and cathe
drals rises the Christ of Bethlehem and
Calvary and Olivet, nay the Christ of
to-day, risen from the dead, regnant in
the heavens.

and metaphor. Understood in this way,
It may be read and studied with much
profit. It is a collection of ancient

methods, teaches the initiate, while It
conceals the real truth from the pro

The first four chapters of Genesis
contain one of the best accounts of

It is only those uninformed who accept
It literally. Its "gods" (elohlm) were

To accept the Bible literally is to be
lieve Jehovah (more correctly. Jahveh,
or Yahveh) to be wicked, changeable
anl cruel beyond conception. Note the
slaying of the Philistines coupled with
the reservation of the young and come
ly virgins; the hardening of Pharoah's
heart to afford greater opportunities
for slaughtering the Egyptians; the
slaying of the innocent Israelites be
cause of David's disobedience in num
bering them, and many other examples,
all of which are simply horrible if
taken in their literal sense.

man's place In nature. It is In this way
that the Bible ought to be studied, and
those incapable of doing so would bet
ter let it alone.
The most helpful and uplifting light
in which to view the character of Jesus
Is to look upon him as a God-like man
â not as a man-like god.
Conceived of as the creator and pre

as a perfect vehicle for the expression

A NEW GYMNASIUM GAME.
A new gymnasium game which has
achieved great popularity this winter
at Dr. Ravage's Institute is known as
"curtain-ball." It is played with a reg
ular basket-ball, and possesses much
of the vigor though not of the scientific
points of play of the older game. A cur
tain eight feet high, suspended from
a wire, is stretched across the center of
the gymnasium. The players, divided
evenly into two sides (there is no limit
to the number which may take part,
except that suggested by the size of the
room), range themselves on the oppo
site sides of this partition. The object
of each side is to project the ball over
the curtain into the territory of its op
ponents, a point being scored every
time it touches the ground, in favor of
those who- threw it. It thus becomes
'the constant endeavor of each division
to prevent the ball from landing on its
own ground, as well as to throw it Into
the court of its opponents.
As the curtain renders the move
ments of the players invisible on oppo
site sides, the interest and excitement
are kept constantly at the highest
pitch. Nobody knows from which quar
ter the leather sphere may come flying
over the partition, and consequently
all parts of the court must be kept ade
quately guard?d. Until they learn by
experience the truth of this principle,
the players are very apt to mass to
gether when the ball comes in sight,
all 1 scrambling at once in its direction.
Then if It Is returned more quickly
than usual, they do not have time to
separate and scatter about before it
flies over again, this time in an entirely
different portion of the court. Some
times two balls are used, greatly
heightening the activity of the game
and making still more imperative the
necessity for covering the courts well.
Occasionally, when there is a large
game, as many as three balls have
been kept going. Then indeed there is
a mad scramble, and an accompani
ment of calling and laughing which, to
gether with the violent exercise, leave
the girls breathless and tingling at the
end of a few minutes' play. The um
pire for the game stands at one end of
the curtain, Just as he does at the net
in tennis, from which point a view ot
both courts is obtained. He is obliged
to keep a sharp lookout, for the sets of
players, cut off as they are fromvsight
of each other, have no means of know-
Ing when the ball strikes ground in the

AND AFTER ATTACK.
NO more welcome news was ever
received by California Vineyard-
Ists than that relating to the dis
covery of a "cure" for the phyl
loxera that has just come to this
country from France.
M. de Dubols, on the Â£sth of Novem
ber, 1897, made a communication to the
Academy of Sciences in Paris, stating
that he had discovered a natural para-
Bite to the phylloxera.
This announcement, couched In sim
pie terms and straightforward, has
claimed the attention of scientists the
world over. Especially in California |
does the Interest run high, for it is here
that the dread phylloxera originates.
Over at the State University in Berke
ley they are preparing to send a spe
cialist to France to investigate and re
port on the efficacy of the discovery.
The importance of the discovery of
something that will destroy the phyl
loxera, the menace and constant terror
of vineyardists, can scarcely be real
ized. With the deadly phylloxera prob- i

wines, and realizing the large revenues
accruing from a flourishing wine in
dustry the old Mission padres imported
vines and planted them alongside of j
the native vines. Other States had tried j
to grow the foreign vines, but unsuc- ;
cesafully. Here, however, they throve
and in the course of a few years the
vineyards of this State had as many
foreign vines as native ones. But then \
0:; ie trouble began to brew. The phyl
loxera is a natural parasite to the na
tive California vines and has existed
since time immemorial without harm- i
ing the vines, but it was discovered j
that as soon as the phylloxera attacked
the imported vines they ceased to bear
In profusion and grew less and less able
to withstand the attacks of the deadly
parasite.
In 1863 it was first noticed that the j
phylloxera had found its way into

there. Consternation reigned supreme, i

caused a ripple of amusement to spread
over France and scatter the gloom of
Impending danger for a moment. But
all too soon it was realized that the
danger had not even boon fully meas
ured. Entire vineyards succumbed to
the dread parasite and whole villages
had to emigrate. When hope had well
nigh fled M. Henri Marls came forward
ith a theory that while it involved
Ifhe expenditure of an incalculable sum
of money, yet was bailed as the one
means of salvation. "If." said M.
Marls, "the California vine can resist
the phylloxera we must send over there
for a quantity of them, uproot our
vineyards, and replant them, grafting
the California vine with our non-resist
ant ones.
Scientists agreed that this was the
only thing to be done, but how to
bring it about was the serious prob
lem that confronted them. The peasant
could not afford to uproot his vineyards
and replant them, so the Government
came to his aid. The magnitude of the
expense incurred can be partially real
ized, when it is stated in the French
Government statistics that it amounted
to more than the entire cost of the
Franco-Prussian war, including the in
demnity of five billions, property de
stroyed, and food and pay for the
But scientists did not coaso to grap
ple with the problem of destroying the
phylloxera itself, for it has always
been believed that it could be solved
In some way other than by uprooting
and replanting. However, it looked as
though the honor of discovering the
means of wiping it out would fall to
Rome unborn scientist in the centuries
to come. The act providing for the re
ward of 5300,000 to the inventor was
allowed to become illegal, and then
comes forward M. Henri de Dubois
with what is thought is the true solu

students, that there must be a parasite
of the phylloxera, and if that could be
found the phylloxera would be doomed
âthat is to say, that the phylloxera, a
parasite itself which feeds on grape
could be wiped out, if a para-
W-te that feeds on the phylloxera could
be found.
M. de Dubois discovered the action of
the parasite upon the phylloxera en
tirely by accident. Ho had thrown

PHYLLOXERA IS DOOMED.
News ccmes from France that a foe to the deadly phylloxera
has just been discovered by a sci.ntist named M. <fe Dubcis.
The fee is said to be a certain kind of vegetable bacteria that

The professors at Berkeley are anx

if favorable some one of them will be
sent to France to study this welcome

the department of viticulture, when
questioned as to the importance of this
discovery, said that it could not possi
bly be overestimated. "If M. de Du
bois has discovered the natural para
site of the phylloxera, and we have
good reason to believe he has, one of j
the greatest problems confronting not j
i rly France and California, but other
nations as well, has been solved. The
phylloxera has spread from America,
the wine-producing world. Italy,

Australia, are all infested with it.

take more than 1000 billion to make a

sand hiding them. With such an in
dustrial bacteriological laboratory as
we have at Berkeley and which is the
<>nly une west of the Mississippi River,
rÂ«s pi -m as we learn something definite
we fan commence work.
"The first thing to be done Is to- isolate
them and then to find some transpar
ent medium, which corresponds to soil,
in which these bacteria will grow-.
Then, having found this medium, you
must experiment with a great number
of mediae to find the most favorable
one, also they must be grown at all pos
sible temperatures.
hen the proper temperature is
found they can then be multiplied at
will. There seems to be two forms
thus far found. The work being done
abroad at present is to ascertain which
one is the most efficient. This is work
for only the most expert and experi
enced bacteriologist. The ordinary
viticulturist would find It beyond him.
Once having isolated the bacteria and
knowing its life history it will be easy
to find practical means for multiplying
and applying it.
Ke life history of the phylloxera is
complicated. The winter egg,
scopical in size, corrugated like a
lady's thimble with hook in the end,
is fastened by the female insect In the
beginning of winter under the old bark.
From this egg comes one insect, which
trawls up on the tenderest portion of
the leaf and stings the upper surface.
As the leaf grows around it gall forms
on the lower surface. In this gall the
original phylloxera lays from 500 to
600 eggs, each one of which in turn
produces an insect which without sex
uation lays from 400 to 500 eggs. Each
insect which is developed from
one of these will lay from 300 to 400
eggs, and go on down, making a geo
metrical progression that cannot be
figured. As yet it is harmless to the
vines, and remains on the leaf for a
variable time. After an uncertain
length of time it becomes the danger
ous root form. It continues to lay an
infinitesimal number of eggs and re
produces itself without sexuation.
After it has remained on roots of vines
for an undetermined period a small
number come up on the trunk of the
vine and become the winged form.
Each one of these lays from four to
eight eggs. The insects coming from
these eggs are males and females. This
is the only sexuation form, and they
are without a mouth or digestive ap
paratus. The moment their mission in
life is accomplished both die. The fe
male lays one egg, which is the orig
inal winter egg with which the pro
gression started.

Value of the 'Discovery to the Vineyards of California*
I certainly consider the communication of Monsieur Dubols to the Academy of Sciences of France worthy
of thorough investigation. If it be true that a .parasite of phylloxera has been discovered, it is of the greatest
importance to the State of California. From the account published in the "Comptes Rendus" of the Academy
of Sciences of France (November 15, 1897, page 790) it would seem that something has actually been found and
isolated that positively kills the phylloxera. The problem now to be salved is its practical application. This
of course requires a vast amount of experiment and labor in the laboratory and vineyard.
It is not permissible to doubt the fact that there has been Isolated and cultivated a parasite as described.
The Academy of Sciences of France is the greatest scientific body in the world, and none but the best observ
ers are able to have communication received and printed as part of the transactions of that body; so that
when a fact is stated in the "Comptes Rendus" the world must accept it. The actual value of the observa
tion remains of course to be determined. The fact, hrrwever, must be accepted.
The College of Agriculture has an excellent industrial laboratory, and Is trying to procure some of the Du
bois bacteria, but it is very doubtful if we can do so for some time to come. Even if we do procure some, it
will take a long time to experiment with it so that we can find the most practical methc-d of applying it. We
should utilize the experiments of the many foreign scientists who are at work on the problem, by sendingsome
one on to investigate.
The whole thing may turn out to be valueless, then again it may prove to be the saving of the 187,000 acres
of vines still left to us, so- that we cannot afford to ignore it, especially as the cost of Investigation is merely
nominal. ARTHUR P. HAYNE,

every acre of these vines was doomed
to destruction in the course of time,
varying according to the circum
stances, some perhaps withstanding
for ten years, others holding out for
fifty, but eventually all would succumb
to the deadly parasite. There would
then be nothing to be done but uproot
them and replant them with resistant
American roots grafted with table
and wine grapes. The loss entailed by
this can be relatively estimated by a
study of the cost of replanting the
vineyards of France. Only once be
fore has California been threatened
with as dangerous a calamity, and
then, too, we were saved just in time
and by similar means. Every fruit
tree in California was threatened with
imminent destruction from the cot
tony cushion scale, which had spread
here from Australia. An immense
sum of money was spent fighting it,
uselessly. It was then discovered that
the collopterae (or, as it is more com
monly called, ladybird) is a para
site of the cottony cushion scale. A
specialist was sent to Australia and
six couples of the ladybirds were
brought to California. By multiplying
and breeding them enough were ob
tained for free distribution, and thus
at the expense of a few thousand dol
lars the fruit and flower industry of
California, valued at hundreds of mil
lions of dollars, was saved. If the
parasite of the phylloxera has been
found we can undoubtedly handle
them in our laboratory, breod and
multiply them, and then distribute
them, with proper and minute instruc
tions, to the vineyardists of the State,
thus saving to them at least $20,000,c00,
for that would be the Tunlmum loss
entailed in uprooting and replanting.

THE LATEST ACT WITH A HORSE.
LONG ago the circus reached out and
appropriated certain features of tne
vaudeville show tn add interest and
variety to its own legitimate per
formances, but it is only very re
cently that the vaudeville entertainment
saw its way Hear to a friendly revenge.
The horse is a beautiful and intelligent
animal, susceptible of high training, and
capable of doing "turns" which delight
even the most captious of audiences, but
he has, or has had heretofore, one great
drawback as a stage artist, and that is
that he generally requires quite a large
amount of space in which to display his
accomplishments, and space is somewhat
inconveniently limited behind the foot
lights.
Professor Gautier. now exhibiting his
own norve and his equine pupil's surpris
ing intelligence and docility at the Or
pheum. has, however, managed to orig
inate a sort of "multum in parvo" act
which brings down the house nightly.
The preparations for his part of the
evenings programme are simple In the
extreme. There is no scattering of saw
dust and no glitter of spangles and tinsel.
A circular platform fifteen feet in diame
ter is erected, ten feet above the stage
proper, on slender but strong iron sup
ports, and up an inclined plane leading
to it dashes the horse in charge of an
equerry, and facing the audience bows
his acknowledgments of the applause
which he has learned to think his due.
A moment later and his master is in the
saddle, the equerry has disappeared tak
ing the gangplank with him. and the
handsome, clean-limbed, satin-skinned
creature begins to "mark time" critically
and accurately with one of his dainty
fore hoofs. Then, after getting fully into
the swing of the music, he begins a series
of evolutions and convolutions which
would win him hearty praise even if per
formed on the broad and safe expanse of
a circus ring, but which are simply as
tonishing considering the extremely nar
row and danger-surrounded limits which
encompass him.
He marches and counter marches, does
"steps" intricate and graceful enough to
make the ordinary danseuse envious,
waltzes as if waltzing were a positive
pleasure, and "reverses" again and .again,

apparently with the greatest appreciation
of his own skill. Not once does he lose

Faster and faster grows the music anfl

Round and round the very edge of the
perilously small circle he dances, with
flashing eyes and tossing head, excited
but not confused by the glare of the
lights directed full upon him, the noise
of the music at his feet and the loud ap

Then comes tne finaleâ a dizzy pirouette
in the center of his mushroom-like stage,
ending in a noble tableaux. Straight up
into the air he rears, his front hoofs

artistic pose he stands statuesquely im

that his responsibility as an entertainer
is over for the evening.
A WAIF OF THE REVOLUTION.
"The Adventures of Francois," the
new story by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, au
thor of "Hugh Wynne," is running as
a serial in The Century. The author,
in the sub-title, describes his hero as
"Foundling, Thief, Juggler and Fenc
ing Master During the French Revolu
tion." In the February number of the
magazine there is the following ac
count of one of the tricks of Francois
and his pet dog Toto:
Francois, as he used to relate, hav
ing risen in his profession, found a
certain pleasure in good clothes, and
being of a dramatic turn, could put on
an air of bourgeois sobriety, or, with a
sword at his side and a bit of lace here
and there, swagger as a lesser gentle
man. If things were very bad, he sold
Toto and all his fine tricks for a round
sum, and in a day or two was sure to
find the dog overjoyed and back again
at the garret door. The pair were full
of devices. There was Toto, a plated
snuff box in his mouth, capering be
fore some old gentle or some slow pac
ing merchant; appears Francois, re
sistlessly smiling.
"Has monsieur lost a snuff box?"
"My. dog? Yes, monsieur; but he Is
honest and clever, too."
Monsieur, hastily searching, produces
his own snuff box â the indispensable
snuff box of the day.
"No; thanks." And it is noted that
the box he shows is of gold, and Into
what pocket it falls. In the next crowd
Toto knows how to make a disturbance
with some fat lap dog, and in the con
fusion thus created the snuff box
changes owners.
"If the man be sorry I at least am
made happy," says Francois; "and ha
hath been the better for a lesson in
caution. I got what I needed, and he
what he required. Things are very
even in this world." Francois had
learned philosophy among the cures
and priests of the choir house. As he
avoided great risks, and, as I have
said, was averse to violence, he kept
clear of detection, and could deceive
the police of the King if by rare chance
he was in peril of arrest. When the
missing property was some minor arti
cle, such as a handkerchief, it was in
stantly hid in Toto's mouth. The dog
skipped away, the outraged master
was searched; the bewildered owner
apologized, and the officers were shock
ed at such a needless charge. Francois
talked about his offended honor, and as
he looked at 20 to be a strong man of
full age, the affair was apt to go no
further.
Half the cleverness and thought thus
devoted to an ignoble pursuit would
have given him success In more honest
ways. But for a long time no angel
chance tempted him. and it must be
admitted that he enjoyed the game he
pursued and was easily contented, not
eagerly caring to find a less precarious
and less risky mode of life.
Temperament is merely a permanent
mood. Francois was like the month of
June in his dear Paris. There might be
storms and changes, but his mental
weather had the pleasant insurance of
what was in the order of his despotic
nature. To be the owner of the con
tinual sunshine of cheerfulness has its
drawbacks. It deprives a man of some
of the wholesome lures of life. It dulls
the spurs which goad us to resolve.
It may make calamity too easy of en
durance. To be consistently cheer
ful may be in itself a misfortune. It
had for this vagrant all the values and
some of its defects. His simple, gay
existence and his flow of effervescent
merriment kept him happy and
thoughtless. Most persons of this rare
type like company, but Francois was
an exception. He was better pleased
to be alone with h!s <log and usually
desired no other company. As the
poodle could not talk his master was
given to making answers for him. and
finding no one to his taste among the
Crab's villainous lodgers, kept to him
self and was satisfied. Nor did he
ever appear to have imagined what
the larger world he knew not held of
human society which would have com
forted that void in his heart which ha
acknowledged at times, but had no
way to fill. When fortune played him
some sorry trick he laughed, and un
consciously quoted La Rochefoucauld.
"Toto, ah, my Â¥oto, one can never be
as cunning as everybody." This was
apropos of an incident which greatly
amused him.

STRANGE ADVENTURES OF A WOMAN MISSIONARY IN CHINA
STRANGE and diverse are the
experiences of a young woman
missionary In China, according
to Miss Mary L. Ostrom. Miss
Ostrom has been laboringamong
them for years. Her experiences are
unique In the missionary line because
she labors independent of any society,
defraying her expenses by speaking
and by private philanthropic contribu
tion. Her method of work is to begin
with the establishment of Industrial
schools for women and girls in the
province of Quong Tung, in South
ern China, among what is called the
Haka people, with whose dialect she
is perfectly familiar. Her theory is
that the higher Industries may be made
potent in lifting a majority of women
from their present existing state of
degradation.
In telling about the brutalized con
dition of the lower classes Miss Os
trom tells of a case coming under her
notice where a woman gave into the
hands of her mother a new-born
daughter, with instructions to kill it
against the corner of the house.
"The inhuman grandmother was
with difficulty persuaded to desist,"
said Miss Ostrom, "but at last con
sented to give the child away.
"On another occasion I saw two
Chinese, with baskets upon carrying
poles, but instead of fowls or vegeta
bles the baskets contained four or
five very young infants, which had
been given them and which they were
trying to sell like so many puppies.
When the children became hungry the
baskets were lowered and the men,
with the tips of their fingers, thrust
a pastelike mixture into their wailing
mouths.
"This queer traffic of baby selling
is not without patrons, and women
with sons frequently purchase these
female infants to rear as daughters
in-law.
"Parents and guardians arrange
marriages between very young chil
dren, and these engagements are sel
dom broken, notwithstanding the in
terested parties often display a strong
dislike if not hatred for each other
when the age of young man and
womanhood is reached. So hopeless
is the future to many Chinese girls
that we have known those who be
came converts to make the matter a
subject of prayer, asking their friends
at the mission to join them in peti
tioning the Father to deliver them
from marriage- with the husband of
their parents' choice.
"In one of our mission schools were
two children of perhaps 8. who had
been thus betrothed though hating each
other with all the strength of their
young hearts, a condition of affairs
which seemed greatly to amuse their
playfellows, who were constantly teas
ing little An Lan and Fook Sing about
their future union. 'It does no good
to hate each other,' they would say, 'for
you'll he husband and wife one day.'
"On one occasion a woman sent word
to me that she wished the missionaries
to take charge of her son. I went to
learn her object, thinking she wished a
small boy taught or a youth employed
as a servant. I found her in one of the
steep hillside graveyards, so common
in this country, engaged in drying
grain upon the flat stone surface of one
of the projecting tombs.
"Informing her that I had come from
the mission to learn her wishes regard-
Ing her son, she inquired, "Are there
not two ku nyong (unmarried women)
at the mission?"
"When I answered yes she said, 'I
have never yet arranged a marriage
for my son, but as he wishes to travel
in foreign parts I thought it possible
that one of those missionary woman
might take him for a husband, and
thus he could go abroad.'
"Much amused, I inquired, 'What Is
the age of your son?'
TO PRESERVE FORT TICONDEROGA.
Every historical society In th*> country la Interested in the preservation of old
Fort Tlconderoga. The Colonial Dames of tills State have added their mile of Influ
c-nce to the movement now on foot toward this end by passing resolutions favoring
the Introduction of a hill in the present Congress to provide funds for the purpose.
The old ruin of Tlconderoga at present consists of only a few crumbling walls
and almost daily relic hunters are carrying off what little is left of them. If nothing
is done it will be but a short time before the old fort is obliterated entirely.
The descendants of the heroes of the war of, 1812 are numerous and the socie
ties of Sons of Colonial Sires and the Colonial Dames. although they have naturally
a mom limited membership, are very influential. These are but a few of the socle
ties that never fail to manifest an active interest in the preservation of every his
toric reminder that may serve to awaken In the coming generations true patriotism
and bring forcibly to mind the heroic men and women who during the Colonial and
Revolutionary period sacrificed all for their country's future greatness and glory.
No one who recalls this fort, around which duster so many notable events of the
French and Indian war. as woll as of the Revolution, would hesitate to do all in his
or her power to preserve what is left of such a ruin, for it was eleven years before
the Mayflower landed that Champlaln'a battle with the Indians in ISOS took place on
the lowlands near the fort. The French began to construct the fort in 1756 and
named It Carillon, and on the Bth of July, 1755. Abercromble atacked the outworks of
the fort.
Dr. Joseph Cook in his history of Tlconderoga says: "Around the walla of Tlcon
deroga. along the shores of Champlaln and Iloricon (Lake George), were the school
grounds of the Revolution. In the French war Provldenco prepared the colonies to
endure the war for liberty. Prescott and Stark, Pomeroy and Putnam, as rangers

"Before our arrival few of the peo

to them we were objects of terror as
well as curiosity. The women with

shrank from us as though *>ur tounh

"Others took us for Catholic priests,
several of whom had preceded us In
this field of work. One day while
traveling I alighted from my chair
and was walking past a house when
a woman, sobbing and making the
sign of the cr, ss, rushed out. Falling
upon her knees before me she began
to mention several sins of which she
had been guilty.
"I stopped her confession and ex
plained that I was not a priest. She
hastily arose, and with perfect com
posure told me if I was not a priest,
only a woman, I had better re-enter
my chair and go on, as it would soon
be dark.
"In the locality where my labors lay
we journeyed either in these cedan
chairs resting upon bamboo poles
borne by two men, or by boat. While
traveling in chairs I have suffered nu
merous accidents through the carriers
falling upon steep hillsides or slipping
in the paddy fields, which would result
in my being thrown out amid broken
poles and general wreckage. To avoid
these accidents I have frequently fol
lowed my bearers through vast rice
plantations barefoot, as with shoes it
is impossible to stand upon the slimy
ground.
"Traveling by water is often unpleas
ant, though in the beauty of waving
bamboo brakes and changing scenery
along the shores, one may momentar
ily forget discomforts.
"In hiring a boat, the missionaries
are in the habit of demanding a writ
ten agreement from the Sho Son Shon
Tehn, or "boat .lord,' as to the price
paid for the boat and also that no
opium shall be smoked during the voy
age, under penalty of forfeiting a cer
tain amount of the sum agreed upon
for the use of the boat.
"Instead of a cabin, these boats are
provided with a covering along the
center, which, like the sails, is made
of finely woven bamboo, and in shape
resembles the old-time prairie schooner
of the plains. These boats are poled
along, and in certain places drawn by
ropes, which are held by people upon
the shore, and a swarm of men, women
and children all tugging at the ropes of
one boat is no uncommon sight.
"To be the guest of a zealous convert
over night .is not the most desirable ex
perience in the world, although, for the
sake of my work, I once accepted the
pressing invitation of a Christion Chi

taste of which lingers with me still.

HOW SIMPLE LI CHUNG WAS CONVERTED.
AFTER a long and tiresome ex

and studiously inclined Japs, my
relief and joy can well be imag
ined when a rather gorgeously
attired celestial, Li Chung by name,
duly recommended as to general
excellence, relieved me of the cares of
kitchen and household generally.
It must be confessed I was rather
taken abaci* when one day I found
Chung making, with a rice mat, tar
and raveled rope, a basket in which
he intended to put the baby "all same

"Men hostile to white strangers have
grasped me by the arm. and, shaking
me violently, have uttered a volley of
terrifying threats. At Kayinchu I was
once quietly walking along the street
when men upon the city's wall, the
height of which is from twelve to fifteen
feet, hurled stones down upon me and
shouted all sorts of epithets. I hastily
took refuge in the house of a friendly
woman and escaped with a few bruises.
"At ai. other time I came near bring

gratifying to me.

hoping that the same condition of |
things would continue indefinitely,

jeering.

which they plied upon our horses amid
a storm of abusive epithets, and to im

carrying poles and baskets across the
street, directly before us.
"Had we been unable to speak their
dialect, it is impossible to say how far
their indignation might have carried
them, and to have appealed to their
sense of justice would have been use

"O, lady!" Chung exclaimed, "noth
ing so good you can give me! the sweet
book!" and he pressed It to his heart,
his eyes cast upward full of religious
devotion. "Lady, I talkce you," he con
tinued. "I go China. I takeum good

mudder, my lllle sisters, allo my cous

had the effect of causing them to dis
perse, though sullenly.
"A stranger to that land cannot es
timate the discomforts met with as
we go from village to village on our
round of work. "We send word that we
wish to hire a room in a certain vil
lage and the chances are that It will be
hardly habitable when we arrive. At
one place I became the occupant of a
room that I discovered adjoined an
other used for housing a water buffalo,
while the room upon the other side con
tained a dying leper.
"The majority of houses are built
about a court in which ducks, geese,
pigs, water buffalo and children indis
criminately mingle, and the doors are
often insufficient to keep ouÂ£ any crea
ture wishing to stray into one's apart
ment. At one place I was much an
noyed by a huge rooster who acted as
though he had a prior claim to my
room. I expostulated with the woman
of the house, but she begged me to al
low him the privilege of roosting there,
as it would make him quite uphappy
to be removed. At this place I sat for
half a day beside my bed, under the
shelter of a raiped umbrella, with the
rain beating fiercely in at the entrance.
"In China one must carry his own
bedding while traveling; for although
many have finely carved beds in lieu
of a mattress they use a strip of mat
ting, while a block of wood forms the
pillow. They have comfortables made
of cotton batting held together by a
net of cords, and when new the fleecy
cotton and bright cords form a pretty
covering, but their condition after a sea

"Cooking is done upon a brick plat
form built against the kitchen wall,
perhaps a foot and a half wide and
some three feet high. Round holes are
made at intervals in the masonry, and
in these jars of coarse earthenware are
set. These jars contain still a smaller
round jar with perforations at the bot
tom for ventilation, and a narrow slit
in the side. These will hold a few
handfuls of fine coal, and the cooking is
done in other earthen jars of various
sizes with wooden covers. In coaxing
the coal to burn a long handled fan
is used upon the slit side, and this they
call 'frat foe,' or fanning the fire.
"They have no way of warming their
houses, and in cold weather fire bask
ets are universally used, and one soon
grows accustomed to the sight of men
and women seeking to warm their
chilled bodies by carrying small wicker
baskets up their wide sleeves.
"A common mode of salutation from
female strangers met upon the street
is the query: 'How many sons have
you?' When a single woman replies,
'None, I am not yet married, 1 the other
persists, 'Why are you not; would you
marry one of our men?'
"The stereotype reply, If interpreted,
would be, 'I am not worthy that honor.'
The Chinese matron, however, may un
derstand it to mean, 'Not for the
world.'
"The blonde stranger will often hear
the remark, without regard to her
presence: 'She's certainly 80. Look
how time has faded her hair and eyes.'
"Another superstition exists regard-
Ing people with blue eyesâ it is that
they are gifted with the power of see
ing into the depths of the earth, and
can discover minerals or hidden treas
ures.
"These Chinese are extremely sus
picious, not only of our motives in com
ing among them, but of our practice
of the principles which we teach. They
frequently start absurd rumors regard
ing us, and do not hesitate to express
their theories to our faces.

Deep as my regret was at losing him.
It was only human to congratulate my
self on his conversion and the pros
pective conversion of hia friends and
relatives.
Well, we parted with what seemed
real tears on Chung's part, and the ter
rors of kltchendom again possessed my
soul. I was too faithful to Chung's
memory to employ so soon another Chi
house to propitiate the evil spirits. AÂ»
he had been an attendant at our meet
ings, the wife of a missionary visited
him a few days previous to his death,
and the rumor soon spread that she
had hoped to obtain his eyes and heart
with which to make medicine.
"A married missionary had a board
floor laid some two feet above the damp
cement one of his house. The Chinesa
looked at the proceeding with suspi
cion, saying 'He tells us he has but one
wife. He has several, and has built
this place in which to conceal them.'
"Pathetic as well as ludicrous inci
dents occur where converts try to emu
late the spirit of the missionaries. One
poor girl had received as a present from
her brother a string of 200 cash, whop*
whole value in American coin would
be but 10 cents. She immediately
brought it to the president of a mis
sion, supported by a prosperous Presby
terian board, telling him as she had
heard him remark that his society at
home were in need of funds, she had
brought the string of cash, hopintr
would at once send it to the relief of
his people in America.
"As the accent determines the mean
ing of many Chinese words, missionar
ies who possess but a small knowledge
of the language often make laughable
mistakes. A newly arrived mission
ary's wife once told me that she had
ordered her cook to make a cake, put
ting two eggs into it. He seemed much
amused and her husband hastened to
explain that wrongly accented, her
order had conveyed the idea that a
cake was to be made containing two
girls.
"And a New York worker laughingly
told the story of the sermon about the
Lord in Heaven. Now, tshu, may mean
either Lord or pig, according to the
accent, and unfortunately the mission
ary had given the wrong accent. At
the sermon's close a member of the
congregation, who afterward became a
zealous Bible woman, soberly informed
him that she should do her best to
reach that place, so filled with pigs,
as she was very fond of pork.
The lot of the Chinese woman of
the lower classes is a hard one, but to
those afflicted with blindness it is in
many cases most deplorable, for she

cruelty. So far as possible the mis-V
sionaries try to alleviate their condi
tion of suffering by purchasing blind
girls and rearing them at the missions
to lives of peace and usefulness.
For many years the prevalence of
blindness among the Chinese has been
a matter of some surprise. So com
mon is it among the lower classes that
it seems like a natural affliction of
the race, due to degeneracy. Miss Os
trom has made a careful study of this
strange affliction and finds that it is
due to natural causes aijd can be pre
vented if the mothers could only be
made to understand the cause.
It is a common practice among the
women of the lower classes to carry
their babies on their backs, much af
ter the fashion of the American In
dians. But instead of carrying the
babe with its head looking back from
the mother, as the Indians do, they
reverse the child and place it so that
its face is up against its mother's
neck. If the child would remain tha*
way all would be well. But it doesn't.
As soon as it becomes tired the poor
little thing's head drops back so that
it gazes at the sky. If the sun hap
pens to be shining it beats into the
child's eyes, and the fact causes no
concern to tbe parent, who will often
leave it in that position for hours. The
result is that the intense heat soon
destroys the child's sense of vision

OF
THE
HOST
STARTLING

HENRY E. CRAMPTON JR., an
instructor in biology at Colum
bia University, is a young man
who evidently delights in upset
ting the fundamental la^"s of
nature. He has been experi
menting with insects, and has produced
some of the strangest-looking freaks
imaginable.
He has produced butterflies the like
of which has never before heen seen.
Some of them have two heads and no
tails, others have two tails and no
heads, and still others have taken the
form of even more curious monstrosi
ties. And they have thrived during
their brief butterfly existence, and now
repose in glass jars filled with alcohol,
tributes to the supremacy of science
over nature.
In the spring a lot more of these
beautiful freaks will be born, and then
Mr. Crampton hopes to pursue his in
vestigations still further. He wants to
breed them together with a view of
studying the heredity of insect life.
If satisfactory rf suits can be obtained
this experiment will undoubtedly prove
of even greater interest than the mere
grafting of the pupae.
For jrou must know that the opera
tion of "bug grafting" must be per
formed when the Insects are in that
embryonic state midway between the
caterpillar and the butteriiy. In that
6tage of their existence Is at a very
low ebb, and Mr. Crampton's exy, -n
ence ha.s shown that only 10 per cent
of the operations are successful. The
others die.
Mr. Crampton Is 24 years old. He ia
an exceedingly modest young man,
and insists that there is nothing very
wonderful about it. Had it not been
for Profeaftor J. B. Smith, entomolo
gist in the New Jersey Sate experi
ment station, at New Brunswick, Mr.
Crampton's experiments might have
long remained hidden from public view.
There was a meeting of the N>w Jer
sey Microscopical Society last Monday
evening, and it was then that Profes
â¢~Â«- Smith epoke of Mr. Crampton's

discoveries. He had seen the speci
mens, and he told h >\\ the grafting
was done. His remarks created some
thing of a sensation.
"1 confess," said Mr. Crampton, "that
I got the germ of my idea from a Ger
man scientist named Born. He had
tried the grafting of tadpoles, operating
upon them when they were in the egg
form. He met with success .so far as
the tadpoles were concerned, producing
some strange specimens, but I do not
think he ever succeeded in getting
them Into the frog stage."
Mr. Crampton's den is a curious little
place, just tli" sort of a place In whifh
one might expect to find all BOltfl Of
queer things. The shelves which lined
the walls were filied with jars of speci
mens, among them being several of the
freak butterflies. In one corner was a
little chest of drawers.
"That is my hospital," remarked tho
young entomologist, pulling out one of
the drawers.. It was partitioned off
into littie compartments, in which were
the pupae awaiting their birth 1 into the
freak butterfly existence. Heads of
some had ben grafted to the bodies of
other?; others were joined back to
b ick, and all sorts of strange combina
tions had been effected.
Mr. Crarapton then showed how he
did the trick. Selecting a couple of co
coons, which looked something like
peanut shells, he split them open and
extracted the worm, or pupa. He said
that each one represented a different
species of moth. â¢
Suspended over a spirit lamp was a
little vessel, containing paraffine wax,
which is used in welding the parts to
gether. With a sharp razor Mr.
Crampton severed two pupae, placing
the head of one on the posterior half of
the other and vice versa. Then, dip
ping a little brush in the warm wax, he
grafted the tw<, portions. In a minute
the wax had hardened, and then two
embryonic monstrosities were pi ced in
the hospital along with probably a hun
dred r.ther patients, who had suffered
decapitation, without serious results.
Some of them gave a slight wriggle
as the newcomers were, admitted, al
though there was very littie semblance
of actual life. One of the little chaps
that was very much alive had no head
at all. Most of them had exchjuurad

heads and tails, but this fellow was en
tirely headless. Where that -organ had
formerly been was just a daub of wax,
and yet he had lived for two months,
anu will si nne day merge into a beau
tiful butterfly without a â¢Â» ad.
When the razor cut the pupa in half
there was disclosed kd interior, con
sisting of a fatty substance, and that
was all. Mr. Crampton declared that
the creature felt no pain, as there were
no nerve cells. After the caterpillar
ceases to exist and the pupa takes its
place the latter subsists upon its own
fat until such a time as it takes the
form of the butterfly.
The specimens which lived and which
are now preserved in alcohol are curi
ous in the extreme. One is of tandem
formation â that is, the posterior Bection
of one pupa had been amputated, to
gether with the head of another. Then
the two had been grafted in such a
way that the head of one seemed buried
in the body of the other.
The two proved to be different varie
ties of moth, and the effect was very
striking. There was one long body,
with four pairs of wings. Other speci
mens had two heads, some had no
heads, and some were joined together
by tissues like the Siamese twins.
It was one of these freaks that first
crowned Mr. Crampton's experiments
with success, and he naturally regards
it with affection, as his first born. The
two moths are of the variety known as
samia cecropia, and they are joined to
gether by a thin tissue. Both are per
fectly formed.
"I chloroformed them an hour after
they were born,'" said Mr. Crampton.
"You see, the uniting tissue was not
very strong, and I was afraid they
might struggle and tear themselves
apart. Rather than have them do this,
and ruin the specimen, I killed them.
Some of the others, however, lived a
month before I chloroformed them."
Mr. Crampton next showed a speci
men in alcohol, which he had bisected.
It had originally been the head of one
pupa and the tail of another. The body,
after life. had become extinct, had been
severed from head to tail, and the in
ternal organs were exposed â  to view.
Across the wound inflicted by the orig
inal operation the organs had fused and
developed into a perfect organism.
"I do not wish it understood that I
am claiming any great scientific dis
covery," said said Mr. Crampton.
"for that would mnke me appear ridic
ulous. Nor do I wish the public to get
the impression that I am merely doing
this to produce monstrosities. My
principal object is to study the color
ing of the insects, with a possibility of
breeding them and learning something
about their hereditary influences.
"I want to produce certain color ef
fects in the wings. The color of a
moth's wings is the natural result
of a chemical decomposition of blood
In minute cells arranged alone the
winga. I am anxious to produce the
color of one moth in the wings of a
moth of another variety. The haomo
lymph, or insect blood, is responsible
for the coloring.
"Next summer, when the inmates of
the hospital become butterflies, with
the blood of various species mingled in
one body, I am going to try the effect
of breeding the freaks and watch for
hereditary results. When I shall have
accomplished this there may be some
sense in talking about scientific discov
eries."
Mr. Crampton was asked what he
thought of grafting animals of a high
er order, but he was inclined to be non
committal. He didn't see what bene
fits could be derived from such a
course. He admitted, however, that it
would be possible to graft the tail of a
wasp to the head of a butterfly, or even
to graft tha slow of the firefly to the
festive mosquito. Fancy having a
mosquito come at you on a dark night
carrying his lantern so as to pick out a
choice portion of your cuticle for his
nefarious operation:
"The whole subject," said Professor
J. B. Smith, in speaking of the matter,
"is only in its .incipient stage. It has
certainly opened up new and startling
avenues for scientific exploration.
Whether grafting of this kind can be
done on higher animals and human bo
ings cannot be said at this time. Sur
geons have made new noses by graft
ing the skin from fingers of patients,
but of course that is an insignificant
matter compared to the grafting done
by Mr. Crampton on his insects. No
man can tell what his discoveries may
lead to."
The discovery has some importance
with regard to the surgery of the hu
man body. This gives it tremendous
interest. Skin from one human being
has been grafted on another. A portion
of a rabbit's eye has been inserted in
a human being. Mr. Crampton has
done on a large scale on insects what
has been done on a small scaleon men.
But all animal life is closely allied, and
what is true of an insect is to some ex
tent true of a man. There is little
doubt that the bug grafting experi
ments point the way to more radical
surgical operations on man.
His experiments may be immediately
useful to humanity. For instance, it
may be possible to graft the silk bear
ing apparatus of the silkworm upon
the body of some much hardier and
more prolific caterpillar.
There is no doubt thnt men have let
the Insects have their own way pretty
much. They have conquered the large
animals, but the insects, as a rule, have
been left in peace, while they have not
behaved with reciprocal moderation
toward man.
In order to understand the nature of
Mr. Crampton's experiment better, the
unscientific reader will find it useful to
have a brief and clear account of the
general construction of the average in
sect.
Insects are distinguished from lower
invertebrate animals by having the
body divided into three partsâ head,
thorax and abdomen, and by possess
ing in the adult condition six legs, dis
posed in three pairs, and usually four
wings as well.
The head carries, first, the mouth or
gans, which vary much in different
groups, the butterfly being only a
drinker; and, secondly, the organs of
sense, consisting chiefly of the eyes and
antennae, the latter being a pair of
long, pointed appendage?, popularly
termed "horns," and possessed In a
conspicuous degree by certain beetles.
The thorax carries the legs beneath
and the wings above. The abdomen
carries no legs In the adult insect, bv.t '
has frequently in the female a more
or less complicated apparatus at the
end, sometimes looking like a long tail,
and used for depositing eggs, and!
therefore, called an ovisposltor.
Most insects pass through a series of
transformations during the course of
their life, which are called, collective
ly, "metamorphoses."
They are. first, the eggs; secondly,
the larvae, grub or caterpillar; thirdly,
the chrysalis, or pupa, and fourthly, the
perfect Insect or Imago. There are
other characteristics of a less obvious
nn ture. but the foregoing are in most
cases sufficient for practical purposes,
and will enable one to determine what
animals are insects and what are not.
The insects are subdivided, according
to the nature of the wings, the feeding
apparatus and the life history, into
groups called orders. Every important
order is represented among household
insects, so that every man is in a posi
tion to study entomology.
From most insects the head can be
removed and the insect will retain
muscular life for a considerable time.
From others the abdomen can be re
moved. The thorax is always the most
vital portion of the body. From these
peculiarities it will be seen how greatly
the process of grafting is facilitated in
the case of insects.
A FORTUNE FOR AN IDEA.
M. Alfred Pickard, the genial Com
missary-General of the French exhibi
tion of 1900, is overwhelmed by sugges
tions for the grand attraction of the
show, which are pouring in by thou
sands.
A Parisian widow pleads with him to
place on the top of the Eiffel Tower an
enormous Japanese lamp shade, con
taining all the colors of the rainbow, so
as to give the tower the appearance of
a colossal lamp.
Another inventor suggests a network
of aerial railways, from which cars
would be suspended to career through
SDace like so many train balloons.
CAN THE
DISCOVERY
BE UTILIZED
BY SURGEONS?
A native of Gers would have a Tem
ple of Beauty, with an exhibition of ty
pical Venuses from every country and
every clime; while a gentleman of
classic tastes would like to see the fa
mous Horse of .Troy and the Colossus
of Rhodes reconstituted for nineteenth
century eyes.
A novel proposal is to exhibit 50,000
francs in gold pieces, and the same
sum in pieces of silver. By an arrange
ment of rhirrois these piles of coins are
to be multiplied to 2,000,000; a scheme,
no doubt, designed to illustrate the
vanity of riches.
A gentleman of soaring tendencies
sends in a plan for an enormous aerial
platform, suspended from four balloons
on which spectators may make a tour
of the exhibition grounds and view
everything from the sky.
Another device is for a pyramidal
railway, a kilometre high, on the top
of which is to be perched in some mys
terious way a true "City of the Clouds."
But of the Wild, impracticable
schemes, possibly the following are the
most nmnzing:
A Niagara waterfall of the height of
the Eiffel Tower, for which the. bold
designer (an Englishman, by the way)
submits alternative schemes. In the
first, he has a mountain made "in
steps," to form a series of cascades.
On each plateau there would a repre
sentative village of some savage tribe.
Up the slopes of this mountain a rail
way would be constructed, with sta
tions at each stage of the ascent.

In the second scheme a bulldinj? ot
the same height would be erected, down
the face of which the torrent would
pour; and each story would have its
attraction, in the form of theaters, con
certs, museums or restaurants. The
top of the mountain or edifice (as the
case might be) would be connected
with the summit of the Eiffel Tower by
means of an aerial railway.
Another project is to make two hills
at a distance from each other, and to
connect them by an aqueduct from
which a sheet of water would fall,
while one of the hills would be sur
rounded by a Moorish palace; and
down Us sides streams would trickle
over rocks of glass.
The last selection from these ingen
ious proposals is that of a Parisian
who would construct an enormous um
brella, capable of being raised to the
Clouds or sunk deep in the bowels of
the earth.
The Longest Tunnel in the World. â
When completed, the tunnel which is
being cut through Pikes Peak, Colo
rado, will be the longest in the world.
The main bore will be twenty miles
long, and connecting with this are sub
sidiary tunnels, with a total length of
thirty miles. So in reality the task that
has been put under way is that of dig
ging fifty miles of tunnels, and every
foot of this vast system will be under
Pike's Peak and the mountains that
tower on each side.

UNNECESSARY NEW BOOKS.
What Is the renson for the continuous
making of books? Why are the looms
of literature kept forever whirring and
weaving? Ik there an intellectual fam
ine? Have all the works of last year
been read, and is there any necessity for
something new? Is there any real occa
sion for the tremendous holocaust of lit
erature in the present day, outside the
reason that authors and publishers have
to support themselves by continuously
feeding the flames? These questions sug
gest themselves daily, for no one can
look upon the phenomenon of the great
literary productiveness of the present
â without perplexity and amazement.
Everj-one knows that the necessary
bockâ the book that Is even literature
is as rare as an angel's visit. To suppose
otherwise Is to hold that genius has be
come a vulgar commodity and not the ex
ceptional gift to mankind that it once
was. Nor is it by any means demon
strable that the increase In the output of
books is in proportion to the Increase in
literary taste. Books are read nowadays,
not for intellectual benefit, but for some
almost incomprehensible reason. Even
the argument that books are read for
amusement in some measure fails, for the
majority of new books are far from being
amusing in the sense that great master
pieces entertain and absorb.
Perhaps the real reason for the in
satiable demand for brand-new books, no
matter what their nature may be, for
the absurd lament of "nothing to read"
(the cry of the new Miss Flora Mac-
Flimsy), 5s that the indiscriminate read
ing of current literature is the fashion â
a slavish and senseless fashion to which
most people who go out in the world are
compelled to succumb. It is the sacrifice
that the majority of people feel they must
make to the irrational exigencies of mod
ery society. The small class of persons
who read because they care genuinely for
literature read books that are literature;
the rest read because the knowledge of
the "new book" supplies them with a
timely fund of table talk. Society with
ea< li decade has become more and more
rÂ« .stive under the constraint of any kind
of acquirement that demands effort. It
must have its information and its "ap
preciations," but of the sort that can be
hastily put on. Culture accomplished by
srrious and continuous application is in
supportable â it creates an unpleasant dis
parity between mind and mind.
Bad taste in reading is, therefore, In
evitable for the average person. Fa
miliarity -with bad new books instead of
familiarity with good old books is com
pulsory. Knowing the wrong thing: Is too
frequently socially the right thingâ for
it is thus that people become agreeable,
after the accepted supposition of the
world. We must be tricked out with un
essential trifles, bedizen ourselves with
the useless book-lore of modern litera
ture, be ignorant of the best in the
sphere of great minds and fluently at
case in a discussion upon the latest nov
elty of the printing press.
This condition of things among the
reading public is one of the causes, we
venture to say, why books pour forth so
unremittingly from publishing houses,
why we are submerged to-day in a sea
of new literature that is a vexation and a
weariness. What everyone needs is not
an acquaintance with new books, but an
acquaintance , with the books that
have already been written and whose
worth has already been proved. When
books have begun to be read for their
own sake, instead of for the sake of so
ciety, people will develop a senso of dis
crimination in their selection. Then,
perhaps, good old books will again come
in lor their share of attention.
Many publishers will fail, doubtless, |
should such an era dawn; for there will j
not be so many buyers of any kind of
book. But it will be, however, the mis
fortune of the few for the benelit of the
many.
HISTORY IN POPULAR FORM.
SCRIBXERS POPULAR HISTORY OF
THE UNITED STATES-Jn 5 volumes.
New York: Charles Scribner's Sons.
For sale in this city, uy suoseription
only, at 12U8, Claus Spreckels building.
This is a notable series of volumes,
dealing in a careful and comprehensive
manner with the history pf the United
States. The original plan of the work
was laid before the late William Cullen
Bryant in 1874, and, with his approval,
work was begun on it in the follow4ng
year. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Bry
ant only lived long enough to read and
revise the proofs of the first and second
volumes. His place was ably tilled by
Sydney Howard Gray, who had long been
his assistant in the conduct of the New
York Evening Post. This gentleman con
tinued the work on the lines indicated in
a strongly worded preface contributed to
the history by Mr. JL'.ryant, wherein he
was particular to call attention to the
plan upon which a popular history should
be built. The volumes before us testify
to the care with which Mr. Gray fol
lowed out the ideas of his eminent asso
ciate.
To those of limited leisure who must
perforce take their courses of instruc
tion in letters at odd intervals who have
little time or inclination for the perusal
of wordy treatises and erudite exposi
tions of the events which have gone to
make history in this country, Scribne*-'s
work should prove a boon and a bless
ing. What has been wanted, and the de
sire has on more than one occasion been
expressed in these columns, is a history
that should occupy approximately the
same position among text-books that
Green's notable "Shorter History" holds
in England. It may be said that the book
under review does this.
It is gratifying to note, too, that Scrib
ner's Popular History is no mere com
pilation from those already published.
The editors, wisely appreciating the wide
difference that exists between research
in books and the same at original sources,
went to the latter for their material.
Hence the qualities of reliability and im
partiality which distinguish the work.
Originally published in four volumes, it
was decided a year or two agr> to remake
the history beyond the chapters in the
fourth volume, which treat of the be
ginning of the war, and to complete the
work by adding a fifth, which should
bring the history down to almost the date
of publication. This has been done under
the supervision of Mr. Noah Brooks.
A feature of Scribner's History that
will appeal to many is found in the illus
trations, of which there are over 1600 in
the completed work. It is interesting to
compare the pictures and sketches in. the

AND

MAKERS
earlier volumes with those in the last.
They form in themselves a record of the
improvements made in reproduction pro
cesses during the last twenty years, and
as such should be of value to the
thoughtful reader. Finally, the History
is clearly printed on pood paper, sub
stantially bound, and should find a place
in many a reference library.

NEW ILLUSTRATIONS TO PILGRIM'S PROGRESS MADE BY
AMERICAN ARTISTS.
There are, we believe, no less than
thirty illustrated editions of Bunyan's
great work. Of these not one has sur
vived as a really vitalized work of art.
In producing, therefore, the set of il
lustrations which may be seen at the
Wunderlich gallery, the three brothers,
Louis, George and Frederick Khead,
may indulge in the comforting reflec
tion that they have done something to
give a new lease of life to a neglected
classic. We say "neglected," for in
spite of the frequent references to- "The
Pilgrim's Progress" in contemporary
letters we doubt if the book is often
read outside the library of the special
ist. Yet Bunyan is anything but a
"precious" writer; he is the last man
in literature to be abandoned to mere
scholars. The whole value of his work
â¢prings from its almost rough strength,
from its adaptation of a homely mode
of speech to the development of a pro
foundly imaginative and poetic inspira
tion.
We have already touched upon the
strictly artistic merits of the Rhead
drawings. They are striking illustra
tions of what moxiern hands can do

liant precision, with less distinction

A sporting compositor thought "Cricket
on the Hearth" must be a slip of the
pen. He made it "Cricket on the Heath."
A writer on angling had the Joy of see
ing his sentence, "The young salmon are
beginning to run," printed, "The young
salmon are beginning to swim," another
thoughtful compositor having been at
work.
Happier was the transformation of the
sentence, "Bring me my toga" into,
"Bring me my togs."
There is a less subtle vein of humor in
the story of the editor who wrote during
an election, "The battle is now opened."
The compositor spelled "baitle" with ar.
"o," and the other side said, of course,
that they had suspected it from the first.
It was by a similar mistake that the
late Baker Pasha, who might fairly be
described as a "battle-srarred veteran,"
was called a "battle-scared veteran," the
libel being by no means purged when tho
newspaper called the gallant oftlcer a
"bottle-scarred veteran."

MISLEADING OUR YOUTH.
THE ROCK OF THE LIONâ By Molly
Elliot Seawell. New York: Harper fit
Brothers.
There is plenty of exciting adventure,
of the kind boys like. In this volume, but
if the author intended it to have an ele
vating or refining influence on our Ameri
can youth, we are afraid her ideals must
be rather low. Also, though great lati
tude is allowed one who writes for boys,
her story verges in places so closely on
the impossible as to appear ridiculous.
The hero, Archy Baskervllle, who is yet
up as a misleading example for our grow
ing sons, is a nobleman of high rank,
heir to an English title and lordly manor.
Yet because his father, as many other
younger sons have done, emigrated to the
Colonies, the boy, born in the new coun
try, is supposed to have changed entirely
in character, andÂ«in fact, to have lost all
trace of inherited breeding. You cannot
turn an English gentleman into a bump
tious prig in one generation. We can
understand the boy's patriotism for the
land of his birth; that is good wholesome
-GIANT DESPAIR."
From the Drawing by Louis Rhead.
I than you will find, in Durer, for in
>â  stance, but with flexibility, force, and a
' keen sense for the color that can be
j extorted from pure black and white.
As interpretations of Bunyan these pic
tures must take high rank. Their at
i mosphere, to begin with, is that of
! Bunyan's England and Bunyan's im
agination. That is not a hybrid'atmoa
j phere. It is one simply of tangible
i quaintness, picturesquesness and intan
| gible feeling. There is one of these
pictures that represents Christian and
the lions, there is another that shows
the Pilgrim escaping from hurtling ar
rows into a thoroughly English house,
and in both designs the flavor of En
gland is in the last degree obvious. Yet
in these, as much as in the mote fan- j
tastic compositions, like that of Giant j
Pope and Pagan, it seems to us that
the artists have evoked just that I
strange air which belongsto their text. !
The frankness with which they have j
over and over again put English models
and backgrounds into their illustrations |
has not resulted in anything banal or |
prosaic. On the contrary, it only helps j
to make this a more vivid and more
helpful accompaniment to the book. It
is an accompaniment, moreover, that is
full of life and movement, again carry
teaching, but what we cannot understand
is the way Mrs. Seawell allows him to
go swaggering through the pages of her
romance, at an age when his mother's
slipper would have proved the best cor
rective for his faults.
Archy is but 15 years of age, and serves
as midshipman with Paul Jones, when
that famous commander captured the
Serapis. The boy, however, has the mis
fortune to be taken a prisoner of war,
and is passed on- from one English ves
sel to another, until, when the story
opens, he is transferred to Admiral Kem
penfelt's charge on board the three-deck
er Thunderer. The old Admiral receives
the boy very kindly, and tries to make
him realize the fact that he is an Eng
lish nobleman. And this is the way the
insufferable young prig replies: "Sir," he
said, straightening up his boyish figure,
"a prisoner of war is subject to many
temptations to betray his cause; but I
did not think that Admiral Kempenfelt
would suggest that I should turn traitor,
and what is harder to bear, should insult
my late commander, Commodore Paul
Jones, when I am not in a position to
resent it."
And so the boy, his mouth full of lan
guage which might fitly have been used
by the patriot statesmen of the revolu
tion, goes on all through the book. ' But
the authoress has the grace to make him
repent at the end. for after passing
through many thrilling adventures, tak
ing part in the defense of Gibraltar, and
several sanguinary naval engagements,
he apologizes to his grandfather, .Lord
Bellingham: "After I went back to Am
erica and experienced your generosity in
providing for me, I recalled all your
kindness while I was here, and I won
dered how you put up with such a pre
sumptuous little beggar as I was."
The amende, however, comes rather late
in the day, and we fear its point will
be missed by most of the boys who will
eagerly devour this exciting narrative.
By the by, the authoress, if she Intends
to write of naval engagements, ought to
get a nautical coach. She might then
avoid such a blunder as putting a bridge,
a creation of modern steamship days, on
the old three-decker Royal George. "The
first lieutenant, who was on the bridge,"
and a few pages further on she puts the
Admiral in the same position.
HOSPITAL HEROINES.
THE SINNERâ By "Rita." Chicago:
Rand, McNally & Co.
"Rita's" latest story is equal in every
respect to the best this prolific writer has
produced. It may be classified under the
heading of "Hospital Romances," as the
leading female characters are nurses.
The story is hardly of an inspiring or
der, but it is clean, intensely tragic, and
ing cut the idea of the author, which
was far from being one of mere dream
and oddity. Bunyan was a practical
man, and no matter how high he soared
he remembered that his readers needed
something firm on which to rest. "True
to the kindred points of heaven and
home," he mingled spirituality and the
facts of nature with a daring that
Wordsworth himself never surpassed,
if, indeed, he ever equaled it. A good
example of the manner in which the
present illustrators have struck the
right key is shown in the powerful rep-
will hold the reader's attention from the
first page to the last. One feels that
something terrible is~ taking place, and
the tension increases until the climax is
reached and the poisoner Is left in his
cell to await his awful doom.
Then, lest the reader have the night
mare, one's thoughts are skillfully led into
a more pleasing direction by the sugges
tion of wedding bells.
FOR COLD-SEEKERS.
ALASKA: ITS NEGLECTED PAST,
ITS BRILLIANT FUTUREâ By Bush
rod Washington James. Philadelphia:
The Sunshine Publishing Company.
The rush of gold-seekers to the Klon
dike has naturally stimulated the pro
duction of Alaska literature. A couple of
years ago no one thought the country
worthy even of a brief article; to-day
we have handbooks, pamphlets, descrip
tive guides innumerable, and. if the Klon
dike prospector does not strike It rich it
will not be for want of published advice.
Mr. James has gone further than the
average gold-book compiler and has pro
duced a handsome, well illustrated vol
ume, in which the wealth and resources
| of Alaska are depicted in glowing terms.
Much of the descriptive matter is writ
ten from personal observation, but the
author also deals, in more serious vein,
with the political problems which the
sudden increase in the value of the terri
tory have brought into prominence. He
has made a careful study of the inter
national law relating to the Bering Sea
seal fisheries and the boundary question,
I and urges strongly on the Government
: the necessity of properly surveying and
fixing the boundary line, of establishing
an efficient? territorial administration and
of taking active measures to develop the
I commerce of the country.
In an eloquent passage the author
voices the cry of Alaska: "From the
mines of silver, gold and coal, from the
mighty forests of cedar and pine, from
the beautiful furs of seal and otter, from
the great fisheries of seal, whale, salmon
and cod, from the enormous inexhausti
ble supply of pure ice, comes the one
voice, 'Give us the protection of an inter
ested Government and we will not only
support ourselves, but will return to the
United States a revenue many times mul
tiplying- the amount of her investment
by the purchase of the District of Alas
ka.' " The value of the book to the stu
dent is enhanced by the addition of sta
tistical data and a complete bibliography
of Alaska.
HEALTH AND WEALTH.
THE PSYCHOLOGY OP HEALTH AND
HAPPINESSâ By La Forest Potter,
M. D. Boston: The Philosophical
Publishing Company.
PARASITIC WEALTH, OR MONEY
REFORMâ By John Brown. Chicago:
C. H. Kerr & Co.
In the first of these works the author,
who deals with his subject from a very
advanced standpoint, endeavors to show
that the road to health and happiness
can be discovered only through the pro
per control of our mental faculties. All
disease, he urges, is subjective, to be con
trolled by thought power, the highest ex
pression of force which can be exercised
by man. To maintain perfect ht-alth it
is necessary to preserve the balance of
nature undisturbed, a task somewhat
difficult in these modern days of hurry
and scurry. The argument is stated in
rather technical and involved language,
but the student of strange and little
known doctrines, if he takes pains to un
ravel the doctor's meaning, will find his
reward.
With equal energy Mr. John Brown at
tacks another form of social disease,
which he styles "Parasitic Wealth." He
does not mince matters, for when at
tacking our present financial methods he

resentatic-n of Giant Despair. It is a
fearsome image, one of fairly Gothic
ugliness, yet there is a note of realism
in the thing which we find positively
stirring. In such guise as this, we
think, Bunyan desired his figures to
strike the vision of his readers, grim,
awful, but unspeakably real.
The designers of these compositions
have not been content to set forth the
salient episodes in the allegory, some of
them, by the way, episodes which have
not been illustrated JSefore, but have
enriched their pages with decorative
speaks of demolishing "a deeply rooted
economic fallacy and a monstrous social
crime." The keynote of Mr. Brown's
scheme of reform is land emancipation
by purchase: present holders of land to
receive certificates to the full appraised
value of their holdings. Also the nation
alization by purchase of railroads, water
ways and telegraphs by the issue of sim
ilar certificates. These certificates are
to be declared lawful and constitutional
money of the nation, and the increased
circulation of wealth thus created Is to
bring prosperity to all.

THE FLOWERS OF LIFEâ By Anthony
J. Drexcl Biddle. Philadelphia: Drexel
Biddle.
Whether the wise words of Buddha and
other ancient sages can be improved upon
is a moot question, answered in the af
firmative by divers moderns, from Tupper
to Carmen Sylva. Mrs. Relfsnider bas
thought tit 'o Md - v o *Jieir ".umber and
offers a collection of aphorisms which she
terms "Stones that pave the path to suc

whether any have stepped higher on such
a pebble as this: "Success secures us
friends and enables us to live without
burdening: them."
Mr. Biddle's "Flowers of Life" are on a
minute scale; tiny verselets, tiny essays,
tiny allegories and tiny remarks, among
which we select the following for its lit
erary acumen: "Elegant paper and a
tasty binding are as necessary to the
serving of a good book as a clean and
pretty dish is to the serving of a delicate
sweetmeat."
AN EXPERIMENT IN PROFANITY.
Readers of Mr. Wyckoff's interesting
experiences as one of the proletariat had
a surprise in store for them in the perusal
of the installment in the December Scrib
ner's. Hitherto these experiences have
been marked by a seriousness whose ten
sion has known no reliefâ and very natur
ally, too. But in the December install
ment Mr. Wyckoff appears In a new role,
as a translator of profanity, with which,
of course, literally transcribed, he cannot
soil his page. The translation, in a rather
curious way, reminds one of translations
of those rollinr compounded, descriptive
adjectives in Homer. The absurdity of
blasphemy, robbed of the short, emphatic
pound of its usual words, comes out oddly.
The effect produced is very humorous.
The scene is laid in a lumber camp near
Williamsport, Perm. One evening a man
who has been away drops in on a group
of lumbermen, seated around the fire
after their day's work is over. Amid a
tumult of voices he is thus welcomed:
"I'm eternally lost if 'it Dick the
Kid. Dickie, my boy, you God-foreaken
whelp, are ye drunk? You ain't spent it
all in two days, have ye, Dick? Shut that
lost door and sit down by this condemned
fire, you ill-begotten cur, and eternal tor
ment be your lot. Tell us what hellish
ttiing brings you here, you blessed boy,
â¢whyâ ripe for endless misery as you are
why ain't you in Williamsport?"
The smile did not fade from Dick's face
as with easy deliberation he took a seat
on a beer keg and looked at the crew
with answering affection in his eyes.
"I'm rorever lost if I've been to Wil
liamsport," he began. "And I ain't drunk
a drop, you perjured hell-hounds of
shameless begetting. I've got all my rep
robate stuff with me except the two God
condemned dollars that it cost to live
at the Temperance House in English Cen
ter, where you can get for a quarter the
best moal that any of you unveracious
ones, you food for unquenchable fire, ever
ate."
God help us! It was like that, only a
a great deal worse, until the blessed still
ness of night fell upon the camp.
THE HORRORS OF WAR.
THE WOUND "DRESSERâ By Walt
Whitman. Boston: Small, Maynard
Â«Sr Co. For sale by D. P. Elder.
With all his well-known realism, with
all the force and emphasis of his peculiar
style, the "Good Gray Poet" paints, in
this little volume, the worst side of war.
His experience amongst the Washington
hospitals was large, he visited and
brought relief to many of the sick and
suffering, and in his letters to his mother,
written between 1862 and 1564, he records
borders and have adorned the book
with a brilliant study of the author
himcjlf. They have arranged, as the
title page shows, to publish it in Lon
don. We hope there will also be an
American edition. Certainly no more
artistic enterprise than this has ever
been carried through in this country.
On every count the three brothers have
acquitted themselves in a way that
speaks at once for their artistic powers
and their understanding of their au
thor, and their achievement should not
lack cordial recognition.

By way of introduction to the letters Dr.
Richard Maurice Bucke, one of Whit
man's literary executors, and the editor
of this volume, has included three of
Whitman's contributions to the press
dealing with the same period. These are
"The Great Army of the Wounded," "Life
Among Fifty Thousand Soldiers," and
"Hospital Visits," and. their inclusion in
the book serves to illustrate* the condi
tions under which Whitman carried on
his noble work amidst the 400,000 sick and
wounded who passed through the Wash
ington hospitals.

One of the latest modes of illustrating
novels is by the simple process of pho
tography. This can hardly be agreeable
to the "black-and-white men," and is not
likely to further the cause of art; but it
is welcomed by authors who have suffered
at the hands of faulty illustratorsâ more
common ten years ago than they are to
day. As a social satirist said of a fash
ionable class of song, "It's very inartistic,
but the public like it best," and we shall
probably see more of It in the future.

The sixth part of "Fifty Tears of Ma

Messrs. G. Spaulding & Co. of this city,
is fully up to the high standard set by
previous numbers of this publication. The
part gives the history of subordinate

the Grand Lodge of California. Amongst
the lodges dealt with is the well-known
Golden Gate, No. 30, of this city. There is
also a sympathetic biographical notice of
the late C. F. Crocker, who was a Mason
of high degree. His portrait, which occu

beautifully executed piece of artistic
work.

Messrs. Houghtnn, Mifflin & Co.:

Mrs. Annie Fields, the author of the
admirable "Life of Harriet Beecher
Stowe," just published by Houghton, Mif

book: "My personal friendship and sym
pathetic relation with Mrs. Stowe dur

and some members of her family to feel
that I was the proper person to do this
work. I hope this confluence will not
be misplaced. Possibly the world will
begin to recognize the true greatness of
the woman when they see the story at
last unfolded. I trust the book will be
one our people will like to read. It is
made as brief as is consistent with tell

adding too much to her own words."

Jujes Verne is about to publish a new
book addressed more or less directly to
American readers. In a recent letter the
French writer said: "There will soon
appear the first volume of my story, 'Le
Sphinx dcs Glaces,' which is, perhaps, of
a nature to interest Americans, because
it is the continuation of the 'Adventures
of A. Gordon Pym.' of their grand poet,
Edgar A. Poe; in fact it is not only the
continuation of that story, but it brings
it to an end. I have dedicated it to my
American friends. I have also on the
stocks a two-volume tale, whose scene
will be laid throughout the whole United
States. It will not be ready, however,
for two years to come. And finally, I
have finished some other volumes which
belong to the series of 'Voyages Extraor
dinaires.' "CATS FOR WORK
THERE Is an odd Httle man
named Echnier who lives in an
odd little house in the heart of
the busiest portion of San Fran

enough. His business is the raising of

rats and mice, and his income is de

He lives at 8 Ashburton place, a lit

the "cat man" and his army of cats,
and is old and decaying. It is tucked
away in a corner of the court. It is
two stories high. Over the door is a
horseshoe. As you come closer to it
an odor of boiling mutton is encoun

He opened a door and took me into

the inclosure are banked by buildings
as old as the house where the .cats
live. The fourth side is a big brick
structure, modern in style. An attempt

the lonely green geranium looks sorry
and forlorn.
And the cats! If there were many

you hear a mad scamperiner of little

house and Mr. Echnier tells me how
he lost his wife a few years ago and
since then hÂ»e has lived all alone in
the second floor of the shanty. "My
only son is employed In the" Smith
sonian Institution in "Washington," he
says. "Yes, it is a bit lonely here,
but my cats are company you know."
After a little while I bid him good

and I am right in the heart of town.
Tt seems hard to realize that such a
place as the catsman's house exists, but
it does, and year in and year out a
lonely old man with only cats for com

to all kinds and styles of cats.
THE CATS REVENGE.
PROBABLY, unless you are a
very superstitious person, you
will not believe this story, and
just because a black cat hap
pened to play a nrominent part
In it. For the mystics and seers of all
ages have dealt largely in cats; the
creature had a hidden significance to
those who dwelt within the inner cir
cle, and it is no wonder that the com
mon people, living outside this charmed
realm of knowledge, said many disa
greeable things about, and attached
many disagreeable attributes to, the
harmless, necessary cat.
Of all the uneducated, sailors have
gins again her rounds to see if every
one is honest and every one Is treated
well. Now no company can possibly
know at all times and in all places
and under all circumstances that its
cars are being properly run, Its patrons
politely dealt with and its interests
guarded: it cannot traipse around in

and help to unseat the one who Is like

No street car company can be sure
that every man on its pay list is going
to be always free from temptation,
slips, or even downright dishonesty,
and so it is no unfairness to employer
or employed to see that the wheels run
smoothly up and down the big roads
and that every one is happy.
This is where the little sirl steps in
with her big head and her right to earn
as queer a living as ever came a
woman's way. She has no very hard
work to do, but she must do what she
undertakes well, for it is a pretty seri
ous thing to report a man for remiss
ness in duty without good foundation

significance to incidents which the j
landsman would pass by unnoticed.
Therefore it was not surprising that,
when we sailed out of the Mersey one
bitter winter's morning, and flew down
the channel before a brisk northerly
breeze, there were old sailors among
our crew who shook their heads signifi
cantly and prophesied ill-luck for the
ship and the voyage.
I was only a bit of a boy myself,
knowing nothing of the sea and its

When I found I actually knew a
"spotter" I almost fainted away from
pride, but anything more demure than
this little lady could not be imagined.
A chance observer would never see in
her looks anything odd or unseemly
in the least. Slip did not even have the
long green veil and the trailing robe

that hat and dress several times a day,
by the way, in order to look as many
as possible, and not to occur too often,
seemingly, in her rounds that neces
sarily take her over much of the same
ground the week.

"and you must not breathe to a soul

"Is it hard? Well that depends," she
said. "There is a great deal of anxiety

mysteries, but my juvenile hair used
to stand on end when I heard the yarns
that Black Tom, our negro cook, would
pour forth in the seclusion of the warm
galley.
Unfortunately for myself the mate,
belonging to the after guard, could
not with dignity take part in these
conferences, or he might have learned
that, if the presence of a black cat on
board a ship was an evil omen, it was
WAGNER AND A FEW OF HIS CATS.
still more unlucky to kill one. But
knowing nothing the mate, a spirited
young fellow, rushed blindly to his
fate.
For some reason this officer took a
violent antipathy to our poor little
black cat, and we had hardly cleared
the chops of the channel when he
made up his mind to execute it. Of re
monstrance there was none, for the
sailors, though they shook their heads
gravely, dared not say anything to one
in such high authority. And the skip
per considered it beneath his dignityto
interfere.
I had just made It six bells, or 7
o'clock, one evening, when the mate
came up from his berth in a violent
ruge. "Where's that adjectived cat?"
he demanded.
Of course I did not know, but I was
immediately dispatched to find the
creature and bring it aft â penalty for
failure a severe rope's ending. I am
sorry to say I found that cat quite
speedily, knowing its habits and the
warmth of the galley stove.
Only the man at the wheel and my
self witnessed the tragedy, but of
course the story was all over the ship
the next day. You cannot keep any
thing secret at sea. Taking the cat to
the lee side of the poop, just abaft the
tnizzen rigging, the mat? did it to
death with a revolver, and tossed its
still quivering body into the sea. I had
reason to remember the time and the
place afterward.
Knowing nothing of the gossip of the
galley, or the still more ominous mut
terings of the forecastle, the mate went
about his duties unconcerned, and our
voyage bid fair to be prosperous. The
black cat did not turn up in ghostly
form mewing her hideous way around
the decks. No one appeared to be
haunted, and there was nothing to in
dicate the awful doom which the rash
officer had prepared for himself.
We drifted across the doldrums,
clawed our way with difficulty off the
Brazil coast, for the southeast trades
blew fresh and strong", and ran down
our easting in the forties before strong
westerly gales, which brought our
day's run into respectably large fig
ures. Nothing happened to our stanch
craft, and just as the netting sun was
gilding the domefe of Bombay we sailed
into that magnificent harbor.
It was a gala t me in that splendid
city by the sea, arid we had come just
at the right mor ent to see the fun.
The harbor was c owded with men-of
war, handsome, f ill-rigged frigates of
the old school, no mere modern boxes
of machinery. . .shore Oriental ex
travagance gave tself full swing: the
city was crowded Vwith Eastern poten
tates in gorgeous array, all come to do
homage to the Prince of Wales.
It was a. great day for Bombay, and
for all Indja. when the stately white
painted Serapis, the finest of Indian
troopships, steamed p>jer the fort and
anchored abreast the city, amid the
deafening roar of salutes, the manning
of yards, the dipping of Hags and a
hundred other ceremonious observ
ances which I have no time to repeat
here.
â¢'What has all this to do with the
"black cat?" you will ask. Wait and
see. The defunct pussy, so brutally
murdered, is soon to nave her turn.
Naturally, being only merchant
sailors, we did not take a very promi
nent part In the festivities which fol
lowed the Prince's arrival. But as the
finest and largest sailing vessel in the
harbor we were anchored at the end
of the line near the Serapis, and were
supposed to play a passive part in im
pressing his Royal Highness with the
majesty of British commerce.
There came an evening, however,
when our passive waiting was to be
changed to activity. The festivities
on shore had nearly worn themselves
out, and, by way of a brilliant finale,
the harbor was to be illuminated. The
arrangements were made on the most
lavish scale, for the Indian officials,
when they do things, do them well.
The Prince was to steam down the
lines in a yacht, and as he passed each
vessel was to be brilliantly illumin
ated with colored lights, innumerable
rockets were to be sent up and fire
works were to brighten the sky in
every direction.
All the materials required for the
! display were supplied free of charge to
I each merchant vessel, so you may be
' sure we went about our preparations
j for the event with great glee. A man,
armed with a colored light, was sta
tioned on each yard arm, the rockets
were duly fixed to the poop rail, ready
for touching off, and a line of tiny
lamps ringed our quarterdeck with a
! circle of fire.
Everything was ready for the
Prince's start, we had had our suppers
and were waiting on the poop for the
; signal gun which should mark the
| commencement of the display. That
! gun was duly fired, but our ships re
| mained In darkness, no colored light
i illumined the sky, nor did our rockets
I send their brilliant clusters of stars
skyward.
Why the curse of the black cat
should have come home at this particu
lar moment I know not. The occasion
seemed most inappropriate, but after
ward I remembered that the hour was
the hour of the black cat's death, and
the place the place where it had been
thrown overboard.
The keen nautical eye of the mate
noted something wrong with the lines
to which the lanterns on the poop
were hung. Like a smart sailor he
jumped on the rail just abaft the miz
zen rigging to fix it. "Take a turn with
that mizzen topsail clewline, Jack," he
cried to me, indicating a rope which
hung loosely to the deck.
I turned my back on him to do so,
and while I was belaying the rope I
knew that the mate was gone. I did
not see him fall, I was facing the
other way, but somehow, with a kind
of instinct, I felt it. Then I heard a
heavy splash in the water and I real
ized that the officer, having probably
clutched at some inadequate support,
had fallen backward into the sea. For
the moment I did not think there was
any immediate danger; the man was a
good swimmer, the sea was smooth,
there were ships all around.
Still, I yelled out. "Man overboard,"
with all the force of my youthful lungs
and rushed across the deck to the
gangway, where the ship's gig, with a
man in her, happened to be lying. We
shoved off, and in a moment were
astern, but no sign of the mate was to
be seen. We searched in vain for a
long time, we picked up a life buoy
which had been thrown overboard, but
nothing more. Then we returned sadly
to our vessel and sat in the blackness
and stillness while the Prince passed
by and the dark sky fairly blazed with
fireworks.
As so many Eastern potentates were
coming and going at this time salutes
were constantly being fired; the boom
of heavy guns shoott the air all day.
So it hardened that, only four days
later, a boat from an American ship
near by pulled alongside. Something
covered with the stars and stripes lay
silently in the stern sheets. We did
not ne^d to be told what it was, our
dead had arisen.
There was but one mark on the still
upturned face, a bruise on the right
temple. In falling the mate had evi

J. F. ROSE-S.OL.EY.
MRS. STEVENSON'S CAT STORY.
When you so readily drown poor
pussy's litter on pretext of overpopula
tion do you dream you drown her
maternal feelings with them and that
she takes no count of her lost darlings
she has brought into the worid with
pain and travail? Mrs. Robert Louis
Stevenson once told of her mother's
cat who had accidentally been left kit
tenless. The kittens lived in the stable
and it was their mistress' nightly cus-
QffS
torn to see that Mrs. Puss was safely
housed when the stable doors were shut
at night. On one preoccupied evening
she left the duty to another and mar
veled when she was awakened in the
night by the cries of the cat in distress.
But cat cries at midnight are troubles
we grow used to, and the mistress took
no further notice. She had cause to re
member her indifference.
Next morning poor puss appeared
like a nemesis, her eyes full of re
proach, a little dead kitten in her
mouth. She laid her treasure at her
mistress' feet and disappeared, to re
turn with another. This was repeated
time and again until seven tiny, furry,
dead things were laid in a row before
their distracted mistress. Then pussy
sat down beside them, lifting up a
pair of despairing eyes, and set up a
howl of woe like a wild requiem.
She had been
unwittingly shut
out of the stable
and the cruel rats
had killed all her
darlings.
"And my moth
er," continued the
sympathetic nar
rator, "cried as if
a baby's death
had been laid at
her door. It was
so pitiful."
THE DAYS OF FORTY-NINE.
Brave days of long ago, how memories
ebb and flow.
Like bubbles on youth's wine.
The days when men were strong In hope
and zeal and song,
Those days of Forty-Nine.
We tolled where nuggest gleamed, where
waters foamed and streamed.
Ah, that was life divine!
We joined in bout and frayâ shook hands,
that was the way.
In days of Forty-Nine.
But now through â welling tears I scan
those misty years,
Those years of yours and mine,
Which through Time's open door have
Blowly passed before.
Those years of Forty-Nine.
And from that silent ghost comes many a
wandering ghost,
Which passing makes no sign.
While from the shadowy throngs float
back the saddened songs
We sang in Forty-Nine.

Mrs. Bridewellâ l'm glad I wasn't

tried and seasoned hostess.
Fortunately Mrs. Murphy was thor
oughly equipped to triumphantly engineer
so gorgeous an affair and the result sur
passed even the hopes of the most san
guine.
The Whittier dinner dance to-morrow
evening has all the promise of a magnif

BIG PAY GIRL.
' I 'HE woman who receives the hlgh-
I est pay in the Federal Government
* is Miss Mary Kirk, the translator
of Portuguese in the Bureau of Amer
ican Republics at Washington.
Her salary is $1800 a year. Miss Kirk
is not only the best paid, but she is
among the youngest of the women who
draw salaries from Uncle Sam.
Miss Kirk was born in Pennsylva
nia. Her father, Isaac Kirk, was a
prominent member of the Friends' So
ciety. She is a graduate of Swarth
more College, where she came promi
nently before the public in a leading
part in the play "Antigone," in the
original Greek. Her proficiency in
languages brought her the teachership
in a leading girls' college of Rio Ja
neiro, where she became familiar with
the Portuguese languageâ a rare at
tainment for an American. She has
been attached to the Brazilian Lega
tion in Washington as translator to
Senor de Mendonca.
The maximum salary paid by Gov
ernment to women clerks is $1800 per
annum. But very few ever receive it,
The next Is $1600, and the majority re
ceive only $1400 and $1000.
In these positions there are many
interesting personalities. Representa
tives of famous families can be found
in every department, and some hold
positions of trust and responsibility.
DANTE, FAITH AND DOCTRINE.
It may be declared at once that there
is not the very smallest ground for
claiming Dante as a -"Reformer before
the Reformation." There is no trace
in hjs writings of doubt or dissatisfac
tion respecting any part of the teach
ing of the church in matters of doc
trine. He would probably have con
sidered any such feeling as most pre
sumptuous, and, indeed, as little short
of blasphemous. A great deal has
been written about his supposed de
fense of the right of "private judg
ment," of his alleged sympathy with
"free thinking-," or with "philosophic
doubt," and so forth. Of this also it
appears to me that no evidence can be
found. There seems every reason to
believe him to have been an entirely
firm, faithful and devoted son of the
church without any misgiving as to
her teaching, or as to her indefeasible
right to teach.
All this is perfectly consistent with
the most scathing denunciations of
abuses in practice on the part of the
Popes, cardinals and the members of
religious orders. Dante himself quaint
ly expressed the distinction in his let
ter addressed to the Italian Cardinals.
He imagines them retorting upon him
that by so interfering he is repeating 1
tne bin of Uzzah. "Truly (he replies)
I am one of the most insignificant of
the sleep of the flock of Jesus Christ,
and etitainly I do not abuse any pas
toral office because I have no wealth!
(Xote the caustic Irony of that 'be
cause.') Nor am I guilty of the pre
pu:nption of Uzzah, because he inter
fered with the ark, I with the refrac
tory oxen (boves calcitrantes) that are
c'rajcsr'ng it out of the path." Nor in
deed is the language of Dante respect
ing such abuses a whit more sev?re
than what may be found in the writ
ings of many canonized saints, bach
an St. Peter Damian, St. Bonaventura,
St. Bernard and many others. Again
that Dante would have joined Luther
in his denunciation of the sale of par
dons and indulgences, and such like
abuses, we cannot for a moment Joubt.
He has, in fact, anticipated him here.
In Par. xxvii, 52, he makes St. Peter
say that he never thought to have be
come the figure on a seal attached to
venal and mendacious privileges, which
oftimes makes him to blush and glow
with indignation even In heaven. But
there; is no evidence, but very much
the reverse, that Dante would ever
have dared to lay his hand upon tho
ark of doctrine. â Fortnightly Review.

GOSSIP OF THE COUNTRY COUSIN
"Sometimes I think that home Is the
best place for me," said the Country
Cousin. "Evidently I was not born 10 be
a social light, for I spend all my time
passing a gamut of shocks and surprises,
which naturally obscures my powers of
repartee."
"Nonsense," rejoined the Society Ma
tron, "your Ideas are becoming broad
ened, e'est tout."
"I agree with you. Say, too, far too
broadened. This broadening is often very
disastrous and may lead to emancipation,
woman's rights, the Shrieking Sisterhood
and the Salvation Army."
"Aren't you a little mixed In your
metaphors?" asked the Society Matron
mildly.
"It's a wonder I have a metaphor left
to mix," said the Country Cousin. "I've
been to call on Mrs. Chitchat, and she
was having her nails manicured, so she
sent for me to come upstairs. I could
plainly see that she wasn't exactly wildly
interested in my conversation, although
I was talking to her about the Century
Club and telling her of a lecture I had
heard there on annexation. Finally she
turned to the manicure and said:
" 'So you really think they are a happy
couple. Miss Digit?"
" 'Indeed I do,' replied the manicure, a
young woman with ' a complexion and
reddish hair. 'No divorce there,' she con
tinued, 'it's plain to be seen that they are
very much in love still, although they
have been married nearly a year.'
" 'Miss Digit has just been telling me
about young Fred Hale and his wife,"
said Mrs. Chitchat, turning to me. 'She
manicures Mrs. Hale. There was a re
port all over town that they were not
happy together, but Miss Digit says it is
not so. He's so rich, you see, that he is
an object of interest, and so these
awfully exciting stories get circulated
about them. Nothing like wealth, after
all.'
"I gasped, and remained silent.
" 'Mrs. Hale was having a lace petticoat
made yesterday when I was there.' said
Miss Digit, making a great show of using
a dozen little manicure tools, when we
all know that one penknife could do it
just as well, if not better. 'It was
trimmed with the loveliest lace, and just
before I left the sempstress brought it
to her, and Mrs. Hale seemed very much
pleased. Then she decided she would like
the flounces fuller, but the lace had all
been used, so they telephoned down for
more. But it was gone. There wasn't
an inch left of that pattern. Poor Mrs.
Hale! It was very trying."
" 'Well, what did she do then?' asked
Mrs. Chitchat, with absorbed interest In
the fate of that petticoat.
" 'They talked it over," resumed Miss
Digit, 'and several plans were suggested;
but when I left they had not come to any
definite conclusion."
"'Oh, dear!' said Mrs. Chitchat, and Into
her voice had crept an accent of genuine
disappointment.
'"Well, It was provoking that Mrs. Hale

them.â Tit-Bits.
THE CLEVER ARTIST.
Not infrequently the art student fall*
in arrears for the rent of even his airy
perch on the "sixieme," and landlords
have scant sympathy for beings who
can "soar to the empyrean," but can't
pay cash. One young man, six months
in arrears, knew that his landlord was
keeping a watchful eye on his trunk,
which stood opposite, the door feeling
sure that while it was there the owner
would not depart. Our artist painted a,
portrait of his trunk on the wall oppo
site the door, and in the night took
himself and his belongings quietly
away; nor was he missed for several
days.

murmured the Society Matron.
"And then," continued the Country
Cousin, "thinking that Mrs. Hale was fin
ished, I began: 'It Is, of course, as wo
all know, the policy of the United States
not to annex land thatâ 1
" 'Excuse me one moment,' Interrupted
Mrs. Chitchat, 'Miss Digit is nearly
through, and we will have a good talk.
1 am so interested in the subject under
discussionâ she meant annexation, and
not the petticoatâ 'and, In fact, in every
thing concerning the welfare of my coun
try; but it deserves my undivided atten
tionâ erâ what kind of lace was it, Miss
Digit?"
" 'I think they called it point de gene,'
she replied. 'By the way, do you like
terrapin, Mrs. Chitchat?' she continued.
'Mrs. Hale is very fond of terrapin; they
were Roing to have it for dinner. 1
" 'They were?' said Mrs. Chitchat.
" 'Yes, and beans served as a course. 1
" 'Well, well,' uttered Mrs. Chitchat,
who seemed too entertained to frame a
reply of more than a couple of words.
" "Do you think Mrs. Foxy is a natural
blonde. Miss Digit?' she asked, after a
moment.
" 'Well, there you have me, 1 answered
the manicure 'It's very well done any
how, and if she is a peroxide blonde, no
body would ever know it. But I tell you
she appreciates every golden thread, and
when shf can get under a lamp with the
rays Fhining straight down on her hair,
bringing out all its smooth, glossybAauty,
her cup of happiness is full. Well, it
seems the other night she was seated
just where the light fell on her, in a
manner to delight an artist and to make
women wonder how she managed it; sat
isfaction was on her faceâ and they say
a touch of the latest from Parisâ and tne
consciousness of looking her best was in
her heart; and Jack Flirtaway was at
her side, when Miss Coyly entered the
room and, in a flash, took in the situa
tion and her rival's advantage. She i 9
a blonde, too, you see, and she realized
to the fullest extent, the vitlue of the
other's position. For one minute she
hesitated, then she crossed the room,
and slowly and deliberately turned out
the becoming, softly-shaded gas jets
above Jack Flirtaway and his compan
ion, murmuring something about the
heat, as she did so; and there was noth
ing for her rival to do. but smile on ari'^L
not allow the satisfaction on her face tc^

though she looked twenty years old^r
without the kindly illumination whirtx
had brought out all her best points.'
" 'And still they talk of jealous bru
nettes!' murmured the Society Matron,
who wan dark.
" 'Did Miss Digit say anything about
the Riding Club? T "
"Yes, she did," answered the Country
Cousin severely. "And I've come to the
conclusion that clubs are clubs all the
world over, whether they are masculine,
feminine, or mixed gender like the Hid
ing Club; it's my opinion that their popu
larity is due to the fact that within their
environments one can hear 'the news,'
and we all know what 'the news' means
nowadays."Paris Fashions
FASHION, in regard to the form of skirts, is quite
decided at the present moment. They are tight all
round in the upper part, and develop in the lower
part a fullness that varies between four and five me
ters. The gcdets are replaced by flat or turned down pleats,
which touch at the fastening behind. I have seen skirts the
front breadth of which forms an apron, to which are ad
justed all the rest of the skirt. It is made of one piece,
without either pleat or gather. To get into these skirts
there must be openings on each side of the apron, which
close completely as soon as the skirt is on. These slits are
hidden by ornaments in embroidery or braiding, according
to the style of the dress.
At Parquin's I saw a dress for afternoon wear of seal
skin. Round the upper part of the skirt is a Kind of close
fitting yoke without the slightest fullness, which widens
gradually to halt way down. The skirt touches the ground.
It is attached to the yoke, the connection being scarcely
visible, is flat in front, slightly scalloped at the sides and
much scalloped behind, and is lined with satin of a dead
leaf color. The corsage is a short bolero, rounded in front
and fastened diagonally from right to left. It opens slightly
at the neck and is trimmed with lapels, with rounded scal
lops. The neck trimming and lapels are edged with a wide
strip of dead leaf silk. The lapels are trimmed with a small
facing of tulle, embroidered with application lace, gold
points and steel beads over blue taffetas. The back of thÂ»
bolero, which Is cut up and rounded in the center, shows
most of the waistband, which is of wide blue silk, pointed
in the center in fiont and forms a corselet. It fastens be
hind beneath a large bow of blue taffetas. Tne sleeves are
tailor made, very close fitting to the arm, especially from
the elbow to the wrist. The cuffs are trimmed with flounces
of the same fur, which partly cover the hand.
Another outdoor dress is of iron gray lalnage. The skirt
follows the outline of the body all round the waist. It is
munded at the bottom and touches the ground. It is made
with a narrowapron, ornamented down each side with three
stiched pleats of the same material, set very close to gether,
but widening toward the bottom, where they round the skirt
at about twenty centimeters from the edge. The skirt is
trimmed round the bottom with a flounce cut out of the
same piece as the apron. The corsage is a low necked bo
lero, cut round at the neck and opening down tne rront over
a blouse of white mousseline de sole, trimmed with three
rows of gold braid. Beneath it is a sort of small waistcoat
of lavender velvet. On each side of the waistcoat are lapels
of white deerskin, shaped like a shawl. The sleeves are or
nnmented with small puffs at the shoulders, and are quite
tight from above the elbow to the wrist. Just beneath the
puffs are three rowsof stitched pleats, ashort distance apart.
The cuft'3 are trimmed with lavender velvet, which partly
covers the hands. The back of the corsage is tight and is
trimmed with stiched pleats like those on the skirt.
A high necked evening dress by the same firm is of black
spangled tulle over white silk. The skirt is applique and
modeled to the body, and has a little fullness Behind, as has
the waist. It is rather long and is rounded at the bottom.
Down the center in front it is trimmed with a broad purled
braid embroidered with jet. The same braid forms two sau
toirs, which descend about half way down the skirt. Round

a rich design in jet and strass, with chevrons of black

chevrons resembling those on the skirt. The t>ody is draped

THE LAKE OF THE LOTUS.
Under the shadow of the Sunriso
Mountains, in the Fairyland beneath
Taimalpals Mountain, is the Lake of
the Lotus. Goldilocks and I were
standing on the margin of the lake
when the Fairy Queen came, sailing
over the silvery ripples that chafed
gently upon a beach of pearl, inlaid
â with gold and all precious stones.
Her barge was rowed by a multitude
of singing fairies, but upon its silvern
masts hung its sails of rose leaves, In
wrought with the Queeirs coat of arms,
golden dandelions in a field, from
which the dandelion balloon â "the only
ghost of a flower" â was pictured sail
ing into the air of Fairyland.
The rose leaf sails were of purest
white, and as fragrant and as dewy
as the famous gardens of the Hes
perides. But. from the dainty prow
to the equally dainty stern of the
barge, were festooned the rarest red
roses â flowers so sw^et that th<=> senses
reveled alike in their odors and In the
wonderful dreams of which they gave
rise.
These were the immortal roses. whir-h
neither fade nor drop one of their pre
cious petals â for they were all from
the magic wreaths of Fairyland, and
every blossom had been on crowns of
Fairy Queens, and so death can never
touch them, nor can they wither or
lose any of their wonderful beauty.
"Come." said the Queen to Goldi
locks, "come and sail on the Lake of
Lotus and learn its wonderful secrets."
Goldilocks needed no second invita
tion, but straightway entered the
barge. The singing fairies hoisted the
sails.
"Steer," said the (Ju^en to her helms
man, "to the Lotus beds and the Is
land of Silver Sleep."
Soon the tiny waves made by the
motion of the barge stirred the drowsy
lotus flowers, but never awakened
them from their slumbers. But upon
the air were launched new and sweeter
perfumes. Among the royal flowers
sailed the barge, and from each lotus
flower came a faint, tine song, in which
the glories of fair meadows; white and
moonstruck waterfalls, all glorified
with the beauty and majesty of sum
mer nights when the stars are few and
large; of enchanted islands that float
in the air of Fairyland under the light
of the Thousand Year Moon: of forests
in which all the trees suddenly burst
into flower and where every vagrant
wind is a song â these were all musical
ly described.
Bed after bed of these wonderful
lotus flowers appeared, and the barge
of the Queen glided so lightly in among
them that not a leaf was broken. Af
ter the barge had passed Goldilocks
heard a soft sigh, and she looked in
quiringly at the Queen.
"The lotus flowers." answered the
Queen. "They sigh themselves to
sleep, not because they are sad, for
they are not, but because they find
sleep so delicious."
Millions and millions of lotus flow
ers, exhaling perfume and drowsily
pinging for an instant. Then, passing
by these, the barge came to the beach
and quay of the Island of Silver Sleep,
and here the helmsman steered in a
graceful curve into a flower margined
bay. while th? fluttering sails were
gently pulled down. Then there were
shining steps by which the Queen and
Goldilocks went to the quay.
As far as Goldilocks could see there
stretched forth a lovely vista of flower
curtained and flowpr-thatched arbors,
billowy fields of flowers of the richest
hues, palaces adorned with roses from
their foundations to the tops of their
tky-searching minarets and towers,
tinkling fountains and walks and sweet
forest ways.
The Queen led Goldilocks to a bower
in the greenwood. There they sat a
while, and fairies of the island brought
them refreshments. Such queeer things
to eat and drink! Tiny berries from the
Sleepy Vine : cakes that grew on bush
es and could only be picked by the
Queen of Slumber; patties made by
elves; ice creams that were served in
cups made af rose leaves and were
brought in by fairies whose wings were
aglow with hues of the rainbow;
draughts from the Fountain of Night
Dews that were in pink-lipped shells,
from every land of the earth, which,
being enchanted, repeated drowsily the
songs sung by the flashing and surf
crested waves of all the seas. This
â was the orchestra to -which the Queen
of Slumber listened with most pleas
ure.
Having finished their refreshments.
the Fairy Queen told Goldilocks that
OVER THE PASSION VINE.
I burled my birdie under the rose -when the rose was all sprinkled with
dew,
And I cried just a little, and some dew drops f 11, so I know that the
rose cried too.
And the white-blossomed blackberries under the wall, where the butter
fly rocked In his sleep,
Stirred softly and sighed, and the willow tree drooped, and the grief of
the pansy was deep.
A passion vine whispered; its red Powered tendrils were trying to climb
to the sky â
So I telephoned <iod through the passion flower's bloomâ for I know
that He ever is nigh â \
"My birdie is dead, and there's no one bwt me here to say for my dar
ling a word. \
He can't speak for himself, but, dear God\don't forget that he was a
dear, good little bird." \
the Queen of Slumber, who was also
the Queen of the Island of Silver Sleep,
was approachirig.
She was a most beautiful being as
she appeared to Goldilocks. Her robe
was of the deepest blue, adorned with
stars that twinkled as she walked.
Goldilocks could hardly keep her eyes
open when first she gazed upon this
Queen. In a very few minutes she
was sound asleep, with the music of
the laughter of the Queen of Slumber
and the low, faint music of the sea
shell orchestra in her ears.
Such a wonderful dream Goldilocks
had!
Across the limpid waters of the Lake
rame a sound like the music of the
horns of Elfland blowing. The eastern
sky was laced with clouds of gold and
amethyst and purple. Through these
curtains of gorgeous woof a faint radi
ance gleamed. At first it whs faint as
the morning star when the sun begins
to lead forth the day. Then it grew
liriphter and brighter, and io! a chariot
of purest and most dazzling silver,
which was drawn by a great company
of snowy-white swans, traveled as light
as thistledown in the illuminated air.
From every Lotus flower on the Lake
of the Lotus upsprang royal heralds,
brave in spangles and finery, winged
and beautiful, holding to tiny lips the
golden bugles to announce the coining
of the Spirit of the Dawn. Upon a thou
sand verdant hillsides awoke ail the
flowers that had been slumbering, so
that the greensward was enameled, as
if by magic.
Behold! wherever a veined and lovely
flower held up its fragrant chalice,
there was a fairy, drinking the drops
of sparkling dew that nestled in the
flowers and singing a health to Dawn.
"What jolly staves and snatches of
fairy song' What animation and laugh
ter and glee: The breeze, that had
1 n slumbering under the spell of the
I.. 'tus flowers, awoke and stirred all
the royal pennons an'l banners of all
the flower-engirdled castles and pal
acos of the nÂ»fÂ»lm.
Hprk' The Spirit of the Dawn, who is
loveliest of all the lovely snirits of the
many-chambered sky, speaks.
"Goldilocks. Goldilocks, come with
me and journey to all the stars
that hang, all glittering around
the neck of lovely Night. For,
10. I go to wake them all: Child of day.
I am longing to hold you in my arms."
With that the chariot descended and
Goldilocks sat beside the Spirit of the
Dawn, and to all her senses came a
thrill of fuller life. Her oyes pierced
the farthest deep? of the skies and the
earth was as one of many worlds, all
of which awakened with song and
glorified themselves with garments of
early opening flowers.
And now the chariot drew near the
most wonderful of all the worlds. The
Spirit placed a flaming trumpet to her
lips Â»nd blew gently.
"At last." she said. "At last, dear
Goldilocks, we shall hear the perfect
song."
Such music! Wonderful organs blew
and wonderful voices sang, and they
serried to float upon seas of sound. But
before Goldilocks could join in the
chorus her dream was ended.
"We must come here again," Goldi
locks said softly to the Fairy Queen
as they once more crossed the Lake of
the Lotus.
"There are other wonders, Goldilocks
dear." said the Fairy Queen, "and you
shall know of them all."
KATY'S HUNT FOR
THE BEE'S HOARD
BY SUSIE VOGEL
Katy lives in San Diego County,
where there are as many bees as there
are stars in the sky. One summer her
father took her up into the mountains
with him as he was working a small
mining: property and he said that he
would be lonely without Katy. It was
hard work getting to the mine, for
trails were steep and a landslide had
thrown a large part of what had been
the road into the bottom of a canyon.
Katy's father was of the make that
nothing can discourage. He had mined,
fought Indians and wild beasts; he had
been wrecked at sea and had been lost
on the desert and had been through
enough adventures to fill up several
books. He made a swinging bridge now
across the canyon and carried Katy
across on his back. When the pack
mules came to a place too steep for
them to mount with their loads he
rigged a pulley, fastened two mules to
a rope to pull and hoisted his supplies
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBBTTABY 6, 1898.
up the steep place. Then he climbed
up himself and leaned over a depth
that made Katy dizzy to look over,
â¢while he secured his goods. Katy never
cried out nor showed any fear all of
the trip. Her father saw clearly that
she was a brave girl and much like
himself in self-control.
Katy had been in the camp three
weeks when she noticed the bees that
flew about her. They all went in one
direction after they had fed upon flow
ers that grew in the bed of a creek.
She made up her mind that they were
going to a tree where they had stored
up their honey and she determined,
without saying anything to her father,
that she would find the tree and give
her father a surprise with honey for
lunch some day.
Katy will never forget what hap
pened by reason of her plan and her
attempt "to carry it out. She left the
camp and recollecting what she had
read about the babes in the wood she
scattered a string of beans by the
path as she walked, that she might
safely return. She found the bee tree
and marked it with a knife that she
might point it out to one of the men in
the camp later.
She then started on the back tracK
for the camp.
Her blood seemed to almost freeze at
what she saw. Directly in front of her.
in the narrowest part of the path, and
whore the surrounding bushes pre
vented her from departing in any other
direction, was the largest rattlesnake
that she had ever seen. It had crawled
from the bushes to enjoy the warm sun
in the path. Its eyes were fixed upon
Katy and its rattles gave her warning
not to approach its deadly fangs any
nearer.
Katy's first thought was to find a
stone to throw at the snake, but there
was a look in the eyes of the snake
tha f forbade her to move. She had
heard that snakes charm birds, upon
whom they intend to feast, and she had
heard that even little children have
been charmed by reptiles. Was she
being charmed? The longer she looked
at the snake, the more she was afraid
to move. She was much relieved, af
ter a time to see the snake close its
eyes, but it was not asleep. The least
motion m=vle by her caused those ma
licious eyes to open, and the deadly
gleam was always in them. She was a
prisoner, and possibly for all day. The
hours passed and she grew very tired
of standing in one position. Again and
again she made a movement to rench
a stone that lay behinc her. but every
time the snake moved as if to dart at
her. S<~> she waited and waited until
the snake should crawl away or some
one from the camp should come to her
rescue.
The sun was far in the west when
Katy heard steps coming through the
bushes.
"Hello, hello," shouted a man. Katy
knew that the voice was her father's,
but she dared not answer, for the
snake showed every sign of anger at
being disturbed.
She heard, with agony, the footsteps
grow fainter and fainter as her father
went away, and her heart sank within
her. She could stand the strain no
longer. She grew rtizzy, reeled and
fell in the bushes. Through her brain
went the idea that nt last the snake
had attacked her. She felt its deadly
bite and then she became numb. She
was, to all appearances, deid when,
.lust nt dusk, her father, still search
ing for her, found her lyincr. in the
path. He started back with horror,
for the rattlesnake wav -'urled up close
to the body of his daughter to keep
warm.
The father took his pistol and
stepped forward. A twig crackled and
the snake awoke and in an Instant
was coiled. But the father's sure aim
struck the head of the reptile in an in
stant.
Katy leaped to her feet, startled lnjo
consciousness by the sound of the pis
tol.
Her first thought was of the snake.
It had not harmed hey, nor had it bit
ten her. She saw her father who leaped
toward her and caught her in his
arms.

STORIES FOR
THE LITTLE CHILDREN
A. series of stories will soon begin to
appear on this page, in which the ad
ventures of many of the old heroes
and heroines of the fairy tales will be
continued. Puss In Boots, Cinderella,
Jack of the Bean Stalk, Aladdin, Sin
bad, Jack the Giant Killer and other
worthies passed through many inter
esting happenings, of which no account
has ever been previously made.
The new adventures will be described
in the manner of the time-honored
stories which for hundreds of years
have been read by the children of all
lands. The illustrations will be by Mr.
Kahler, the chief of the art depart
ment of The Call.
Those were glorious days of enchant
ment, those olden times when good
little boys and girls could meet fairies
whenever they needed help for their
parents or themselves; when Haroun
al Raschid wns in his golden prime
and every part of Bagdad and the
shining Tigris River was enchanted
and filled with wishing carpets and
genii, and wonderful lamps and the
strangest of happenings.
It is not pretended that the stories to
appear in The Call were taken from an
enormous roc's egg, found somewhere
in the land of the Caliphs; but it is
promised that they will be written so
that the smallest child can understand
every word.
If the children have any preference
aa to which of their favorite heroes
and heroines shall first appear in these
new stories they will do woll to write
to the editor of this page and the
promise is herewith made that the pop
ular choice will be honored. Who is
still the most popular among the chil

'Jack the Giant Killpr" or "Sinbad"?
The lpttprs to be received will show
that clearly. Each story will be com

CRUISE OF THE CALIFORNIA.
[Synopsis of preceding chapters.â Binnie,
having arrived in the country of Mah-Coh-
Gaa, has been made a war chief, after some
trials of skill with a savage, who also wants
to be the war chief. In these trials Binnie
was successful. Binnie and Kemona then di
vide 10,000 savage warriors into battalions and
teach them the bayonet drill and some march-
Ing movements. At the demand of the savages
Binnie marches forth as commander of this
army of 10,000 to flg-ht Ghoor-Ghee-Tee, who is
met beside the Marwlse River.]
CHAPTER XV.
"The enemy are coming!"
This report the scouts brought to
Binnie at midnight. Kemona furnished
the particulars.
"Ghoor-Ghee-Tee has with him as
many savages as there are trees in the
forest, a great army, but, I think, not
more than a match for ours. They Will
cross the Marwise to-morrow. Between
our camp and the river there is a great
plain that borders the river. On all
sides, excepting the river frontage, the
plain is surrounded with thick forest.
In the middle of the plain is a hill that
is high and perpendicular, but there is
a narrow pass to the top."
"What is your advice?"
"To move at once and place our tribes
about the plain, but hidden in the
woods. I, with runners, will occupy
the hill and will signal to you all the
movements of the enemy, for I will be
able to see across the river and also
for miles beyond."
Binnie's army was soon on the move.
The hill tribes, under the command of
Binnie, were to be thrown to the front.
They numbered 6000. leaving about 4000
for the reserves, who were to be cap
tained by Koti. The march was fin
ished none too soon. When daylight
came, Kemona, who had gained the
top of what he called "Lookout Moun
tain," sent a runner to Binnie to say
that the savages were in great force on
the opposite bank of the river and that
they would soon cross. Hardly had the
runner reached Binnie when Ghoor-
Chee - Tee's warriors were landing.
Binnie permitted them to land without
opposition. At the river's edge the sav
ages waited for Ghoor-Ohee-Tee, and
with him came Poloto, the traitor! He
had told Ghoor-Ghee-Tee about Bin
nie's army, but the Skull Hunter had
only laughed. He did not know that
Binnie was now watching him.
But Ghoor-Ghee-Tee had a different
opinion of Binnie's followers a few min
utes later, when from the woods at
both sides and from in front darted out
two thin lines of savage enemies, sur
rounding his tribes on three sides.
These lines stood still an instant,
awaiting the word of command from
Binnie.
With his heart throbbing violently,
but determined and brave, Binnie
shouted:
"Forward! Oharee!"
Nothing that Kemona had taught
the warriors of Mah-Coh-Gaa's land
was forgotten. Their bows and arrows
were on their backs. Their breast
shields were firmly strapped in place.
Their spears were at charge. No in
fantry regiment could have made a
braver attack with bayonets on greatly
superior numbers than did the 6000
savages led by Binnie as they closed
in upon the tribes of Ghoor-Ghee-Tee,
who, being attacked in such an unex
pected way and being completely sur
prised, soon became a crowded and
struggling mass and were steadily
forced back toward the river bank, un
able to use thoir bows or clubs.
And now the reserves, yelling like
madmen and led by Koti, came from
the forest. They were the expert bow
men and sling-users. From their
ranks, which were in good order, a per
fect rain of arrows and stones fell upon
the heads of the skull-hunters. At this
the courage remaining in the skull
hunters oozed" out. Again and again
they had furiously tried to break
through the lines of the spearmen,
only to be prodded with ready spears.
But now two black giants fought
their way through the lines of spears
at one place. One was Ghoor-Ghee-
Tee. Few men could safely face him
in battle. His very name called forth
fear. He laid about him so with his
stone battle-ax that the savages near
him fled.
Through the hole that he had speed
ily made in the ranks of the spearmen
poured his followers as a flood breaks
through a dam.
A panic seized some of Binnie's fol
lowers, although there was no reason
for it, but the break was sufficient to
throw even the reserves, who had come
forward on the run, at the command of
Koti, into disorder. To the disgust of
Kemona the battle very soon turned
into hand to hand fighting, after the
methods of savages everywhere.
Here and there were knots of bow
men, who held together for a time, and
Koti. for a short period, held one regi
ment firmly, and with it made repeat
ed charges, driving hundreds of the
skull-hunters into the river. But the
overwhelming numbers of the skull
hunters finally compelled Binnie's fol
lowers to retire to the woods. There
they stood their ground, Ghoor-Ghee-
Tee, having more respect for them
than he did when the day opened, did
not think it wise to try to crush them
then.
The battle-field, which Ghoor-Ghee-
Tee now occupied undisputed, was
strewn with the fallen braves who lay
in heaps. Binnie's army had been
saved from much loss by the breast
shields, against which arrows and
spears struck without inflicting any
harm. Hundreds of the skull hunters
had crossed the river and had fled
from the scene of action. By night
they recovered their courage and, be
ing reinforced by another army of sav
ages, returned to the river and camped
there, planning to recross the river and
go to the help of Ghoor-Ghee-Tee in
the morning.
During the night Kemona managed
to steal into the camf of Binnie with
great news. Then he departed in a
different direction, going at the top of
his speed.
"Brave soldiers," so Binnie caused
Koti to say to the tribes. "You have
done well to stop the march of the
fierce Ghoor-Ghee-Tee, his army being
so much larger than yours. I have
knowledge that, if you can hold your
own one day more, you will win the
victory."
What was this knowledge? Binnie
would not say to Koti what it was.
The treason of Peloto, while It had
not yet led to any serious result, had
made Binnie afraid to trust any of
the chiefs. Already he knew that
some were angry because he had not
driven Ghoor-Ghee-Tee's army, al
though it was much larger than his
own, into the river. True, he was on
the point of doing this vrhea the break
in the lines and panic took place. The
reserves would, in a few minutes, have
finished what his own command had
begun. The chiefs did not consider
this.
Binnie waited anxiously for the morn
ing. "While hÂ° pa^ed nervously back
and forth, in thÂ» shadows of the for
est, Koti touched his arm and pointed
out a dark figure that was stealthily
approaching- on hands and knees.
"Peloto," said Koti laconically and
fiercely.
Peloto never reached Binnie, whom
he sought to kill. The flaring of a
camp fire showed his face. It was al
most fiendish in its expression. Sud
denly there was a sjiarp cry. Koti had
ended at once the life and treason of
Peloto!
After this proof of loyalty on the
part of Koti Binnie determined to keep
Koti near him.
With the earliest dawn the two
armies of savages renewed the fight
ing. An attempt was made
to force Binnie's army out
of the woods, but Ghoor-
Ghee - Tee's skull-hunterg
were repeatedly driven
back. Koti's reserves made
a gallant charge about noon
and drove back the skull
hunters almost to the river's
edge. Those nearest the
river uttered a cry of surprise. They
saw war canoes coming. They knew
that the war canoes did not contain
ekull-hunters. Who then were the
strangers and why did they come to
the field of battle?
An % hour before sunset Binnie's army,
encouraged by their success in hold
ing back the skull-hunters through the
entire day, insisted that Binnie should
make one more attempt to drive
Ghoor-Ghee-Tee into the river.
"You must lead us," said Koti to
Binnie, "or all is lost."
It was once more â¢â¢forward," with
loud cries, from three sides of the
plain. The skull-hunters were taken
by surprise, but were more numerous
than on the preceding day. A most
stubborn fight was begun.
On the right of Binnie's force sud
denly appeared Kernona! His familiar
voice ordered the savages to fall back
in good order.
What was that strange and terrible
sound that instantly rang out of the
forest when this movement had been
performed, as Kemona had command
<d? What was that awful rain of iron
before which the hordes of Ghoor-Ghee-
Tee melted away like snow under the
blaze of the sun?
Ghoor-Ghee-Tee knew and fled as the
first sound awakened the echoes in the
woods. Binnie's army saw that his
promise that help would come had been
fulfilled, but whence did it come? While
they saw the victory was theirs, many
fell upon their faces in abject fear, for
it seemed to them that Binnie had
caused the skies to rain fire and thun
derbolts.
While the fright-stricken rabble of
skull-hunters were frantically trying
to escape by swimming the river with
the savages of Binnie's army, who had
been nearest, the river, in hot chase,
five white boys, headed by Sam of Los
Angeles, issued from the woods and set
up a good American cheer. Sam car
ried an American flag, which he waved
above his head with vigor as Binnie
hastened forward to greet his com
rades.
"And where are Mr. Ostend and my
father?" asked Binnie.
"The}' are in the rear."
"Did they tbink you were able to
drive the savages into the river alone?"
"Looks like it,"answored Sam, laugh-
ing.
Soon after, Harry Ostend and Bin
nie's father came up.
"I thought, Binnie." said Mr. Ostend.
as the boy hero rushed up to throw his
arms about the leader of the party,
"that a machine gun might be useful
in the heart of New (guinea, so I
brought it up the Marwise in a war
canoe, and also brought along your
friends in a small fleet of war canoes
to help make you a great general."

LITTLE MARY'S ADVENTURE.
BY ELLA THORNTON.
This happened one bright morning In
June, as little Mary Bat under the pepper
tree, watching the birds passing to and
fro. Her mothor called her and said:
"Mary, dear, it is quite warm to-day and
I want to make a pudding 1 for dinner, so
you must go for some milk."
Her mother gave her 10 cents and tolfl
her to hurry back, and to bring 5 cents
change. Mary starts off very happy
thinking of the pudding she is going to
have when she gets home. but. as she is
coming home with her milk, she sees a
dancing monkey. Mary was greatly ex
cited and left her milk standing on a step
so that she might run up and see the
monkey dance.
It was two hours before the monkey
stopped. Man - laughed and enjoyed it all
very much. Then he passed the money
plate around and most of the people gave
a nickel. Mary was watching very in
tently and when he came to her she drop
ped her 5 cents in and then she was very
proud.
Very soon Mary thought of the milk.
She ran to where it was and she found a
little cat drinking it. She says, "Shoo,
shoo!" and it runs away. "When Mary
reaches home her mother asks her:
"Why, dear child, where have you
been?"
"I was watching a monkey dance and
he took my nickel away from me."
Her mother only laughed and said: "I
will know better the next time."

REVIEW OF THE NEWEST NEW YORK
DRAMATIC SENSATION.
It's a dull week at the New York the
aters these days that does not turn out
something naughtily sensational. The
\act63t is "The Tree of Knowledge," a
play of Tanquerayan plot, written by
R. C Carton, the once innocent author
nf "Liberty Hall," and presented by
Paniel Frohman's Lyceum Theater
t'ompany. The Brothers Frohman,
Charles and Daniel, are doing their no-
Me best for the venturesome social
drama this season. Charles' Empire
Theater, as I wrote in another column
of this page last Sun Any. is given over
to Paul Potter's "The Conquerors," a
F3.ucy. sexey study in immorals, and
Mr. Carton's "Tree of Knowledge" is
being exploited for the entertainment
of Brother Daniel's good Lyceum folk.
This play of the Biblical title has
caused another riot among the critics,
nhd will doubtless prosper. The Grand
t >ld Man of criticism, William "Winter,
scorches it through one and one-half
nf the broad, solid columns of the Tri
bune, making once again his fight
against the soiled subject of the degen
erate playwright. Winter says
that while doubtless there are rotten
eec? in the world, it is not necessary to
eat them to discover the fact, and fur
ther, that no woman of decency should
be subjected to the performance of
such tainted trash. The other conserv
ative stand-by, Mr. Dittmar of the
Times, praises the piece with unusual
enthusiasm, scorns a single prurient al
lusion and says it is a play that will
linger. The lighter men of the craft
take it less seriously. No two of them
seem agreed on any particular point
except that they all comment on the
brilliant cynicism of the lines, which,
according to the critic of the Commer
cial Advertiser, have "almost the pol
ish of Oscar Wilde, or of a new tinpan."
* â¢ â¢
Here is a long distance digest of the
story of "The Tree of Knowledge:"
Nigil Stanyan, when a young stu- j
dent of theology, has been the para
mour of a wicked woman named Belle. '
Brian Holingshead, his friend, knowing !
nothing of her tarnished past, marries j
her, and Nigil, when he hears of this
concludes that the policy of honor is
siience. Subsequently Brian loses his |
fortune and Belle plans to run away .
with Roupell, the rich villain and the
principal cynic of the play. Nigil over- j
hears the plotting and, ever having j
the interests of Brian at heart (accord
ing to his way of seeing them), goes to
the woman, reviews for her the bitter
ness of his own broken life and pleads
that she will not desert Brian. To this
she returns only epigrammatic imper- i
tinences and scornful laughter, until
Nigil, in a passion, lays hands on her '
and throws her upon a couch. Here the j
husband enters and her quick wit j
Turns the situation to diabolical ac- j
count. With hut indignation she lella
Ilrian that Nigil has attempted an as
*-iult on her. Then there is a furious \
W' jmbat of words. Nigil takes his de- |
parture in bitterness. Belle gives
Brian some sort of sleeping potion and
skips with Roupell.
All this has occupied four acts. To
make the "happy ending," another is
added in which Nigil is well in the way \
of marrying a virtuous girl.

In the dullness of my own town I

read no less than a dozen notices of the
play. After it was first given in Lon
don by George Alexander â some time
in October â I read the accounts in the
principal English papers. And still,
after all this reading, I do not get the
most clear idea of Mr. Carton's pur
pose, unless it be the usual one of no
toriety and immediate commercial suc
cess, which I should hesitate to believe
of the thoroughly uninspired but none
the less legitimate workman who built
"Liberty Hall."
It is probable that Mr. Carton intends
to present a new problem by inverting

BY ASHTON STEVENS.
the old dramatic situation. Instead of
a woman betrayed by a man and left
to expiate her compliance by marriage
with the soft-hearted subhero in the
last act, there is in "The Tree of
Knowledge" a man wronged by a wo
man and made to suffer all the ills, or
so many of them as his sex will per
mit, and married to a virtuous girl in
the last act. The bad Belle has wan
tonly allured Nigel Stanyan and pluck
ed the pearl of innocence from his
youth. Then she has thrown him to
the dogs, or to anybody else who may
have wanted him, exactly as the black
hearted gent of the parlor melodrama
of a few years ago was wont to treat
the truthful girl. Mr. Carton gives
us a man with a decollete past and a
soft-hearted woman to marry him. And
although this has been done before, it
has not been done quite in the same
way. Nigel does not retire from the
gay world.'but he takes his throw
down seriously to heart, and is almost
as much of a wreck as a woman would
be in similar circumstances, and sees
to it that the virtuous girl knows just
what kind of a man she is marrying.
Whatever problem may be teasing Mr.
Carton is perhaps summarized in this
speech of Nigel's: "The world is hard,
and justly hard, on the man who is
dastard enough to tear from a trusting
girl her robe of purity; but surely there
is another side of the picture. What
of the ruin that women sometimes
bring on men? What of the wanton
who beckons to him to climb the tree
of knowledge, and, as she glances down
through the dank leaves, points with
mocking finger to the foothold in the
rotting branches that other feet have
worn away. Science may be right;
heaven may be a fable, but at least
there is a hell. I know it. I have
found it in a woman's arms."
* * Â»
Presumably this speech of Nigil's is
not a sample of that bright tinpan
cynicism which dazzled the critic of
the Commercial Advertiser into the Os
car Wilde comparison. It seems more
like the glittering tinware of Laura
Jean Libby. However, Nigil is the vic
tim rather than the exploiter of cyni
cism under the tree of Knowledge.
Belle is less banal. She says, with evil
brilliancy, that virtue is a matter of
temperament. 1 And Roupell, the calm,
superior villain, fairly showers para
doxes and back-action aphorisms. It
is notable that his conquest of Belle
(or hers of him, whichever way it is
to be regarded) is made without a sin
gle indulgence of sentimentality. "You
are not deluding yourself with any idea
that I care about you?" queries Belle.
"We shall suit one another," he an
swers. "We are not sentimental."
There are no warm extenuating emo
tions in the Bins of "The Tree of
Knowledge."
â¢ â¢ â¢
The fact that a play of this kind and
! the perhaps less excusable one of Mr.
| Potter's are thriving at the two most
respected theaters in New York â bar
Augustin Daly's Theater, which, by
I the way, will devcte its Lenten season
Ito cinematographic reproductions of
the Crucifixion of Christ â marks an
; important fluctuation in the taste and
j toleration of the play going public. It
I means, no doubt, that we are to have a
i return of the drama that is not fit for
the "ypung person"; for playwriters
i and managers are commonly prone to
j fashioning their enterprises on those
| which have been most immediately
i successful. It is difficult to foretell
I whether this will be of any real benefit
to the stage. Many persons who hold
the theater to be something better than
the receptacle for cardboard romances,
j plush upholstered . melodramas and
j other forms of optimistic but unlifelike
i playwriting, worild welcome almost
j any license so long as it might include
the chance of a real play now and then.
! But the difficulty is that so few of the
| public want anything that is real. "The
Tree of Knowledge" bids fair to pros
per; "The Conquerors," it is estimated
by experts, will run all season; and
Ibsen's "John Gabriel Borkman," a
great play that deals hardly at all in
the superficial aspect of sexual deprav
ity, but mainly in the seamy side of
the soul, achieved precisely one per
formance, and that, to an accompani
ment of hoots and hisses from almost
all of the metropolitan newspapers. So

Gommer\t ar\d NeWs of Distarvt
flays and flayers.
Beerbohm Tree's production of "Juli
us Caesar" at Her Majesty's Theater is
the occasion of no end of comment and
discussion from the London critics.
From all accounts, Mr. Tree endeavors
to relieve Julius of a deal of the pomp
and circumstance with which theatri
cal tradition has im'ested him. Rome :
B. C. 44 and 4?. is said to he none the 'â 
less picturesque, but much more excit
ing and human as it is now pictured
by Alma Tadema. The stage of the \
theater has been ruthlessly sacrificed ;
to Mr. Tadema's iQeas of illusion and i
realism. In order to enhance natural- j
ness and get the desired effect of pala- j
tial architecture, all the proscenium
borders and draperies have been re
moved. The entire height of the stage
is disclosed, and the towering buildings
are represented with a magnificence ;
never hitherto attempted, even at the i
Lyceum.
The scene on which the greatest pains
have been lavished is that of the Fo
rum. In Mr. Tree's version all the
events of the second act transpire here,
Including the assassination of Caesar i
and the oration of Antony. And every '
Inch of the enormous stage is utilized
and thronged by a crowd several hun
dred strong, i
Contrary to custom the Forum is not
depicted as a grave and solemn place,
where only whiskered sages congregat
ed and Cicero composed such orations
as "De Amlcitia" and "De Senectute,"
but rather as a gay and festive center,
full of bustle and color, all in striking
contrast to the one figure lying in the
midst, eloquent in death as in life.
The historical record of the scenes
which followed the close of Mark An
tony's oration and the succeeding out
burst of popular feeling are, it is said,
closely adhered to.
Therefore, it is to be supposed
that in Mr. Tree's production of
"Julius Caesar" the platform is torn
up and its broken timbers piled in a
high heap; chairs and benches added
to it, together with contributions of
costumes from actors, instruments
from musicians, swords from soldiers,
jewels and scarfs from women, and
toys and trinkets from the childrenâ all
to'build the pyre that celebrates a Cae
sar's funeral.
Mr. Tree plays Marc Antony,
Lewis Waller, Brutus, and Charles
Fulton, Caesar. Lucius is represented
by Mrs Tree and Calpurnia by Miss
Lily* Hanbury. The success is unques
tioned the Irving production of "Peter
the Great" being positively routed from
the Lyceum.
Heretofore it never has been definite
ly settled whether Maurice Barrymore
was to be designated to the world as
"actor," "beauty" or "wit." But the
manager of Proctor's Theater (where
Mr. Barrjunore is doing a vaudeville
sketch) seems to have settled it with
the announcement that "the star fea
ture of the bill will be Mr. Maurice
Barrymore, the father-in-law to the
son of an English baronet."
It is not so long ago since John Philip
Sousa was conducting band concerts in
the grounds of the White House at a
salary of $30 a week. To-day he draws
royalties on his compositions that
amount to $25,000 a year, divides about
$800 a week with Charles KU-in on "El
Capitan," and gets the lion's share of
the earnings of the Sousa Band.
Villiers Stanford, the Englishman who
composed "Shamus O'Brien," the only
Irish opera ever written that amounts
to anything, is hard at work on a new
score which deals with a seventeenth
centary subject, Why shouldn't Mr.
O'Sullivan bring the new opera along
with him next season when he comes to
home and the Tivoli?
As soon as the negotiations are com
pleted for a Melba season in Australia,
San Francisco will have the chance to
hear Patti's only successor.

describes the decline of Shakespeare
and the rise of herself. May will soon
try to stamp her stout geniiis on the
taste of London. The letter ends in this
delightful humor: "I should like to suc
ceed in London, because I am an
American."
After invading nearly everything in
contemporary life the cinematograph
finally has been utilized to project the
principal . episodes of the "Passion
Play." Twenty years ago Salmi
Morse, who made the hair of San
Francisco stand on end with this raor
' bid spectacle, attempted to repeat it
in what is now Proctor's Theater, New
York, but public indignation drove the
production from the stage. In Boston
the cinemetograph recently did a prof
itable business with the scenes of the
Crucifixion and the Last Supper, and
the other afternoon the same scenes
were projected in the New York Eden
Musee for the benefit of an audience
composed mainly of newspaper men,
and which resulted in nothing more
serious than a column of free adver
tising in each of the papers. The Her
ald man says:
"In speaking of sacred subjects one
hesitates to descend to anything triv
ial, but* really the donkey in the Flight
into Egypt, who, after the Virgin is
helped from the saddle, turns and be
gins to eat grass by the wayside, was
one of the most realistic bits in the
whole series."
Mr. Augustin Daly also* will dally
with the Oberammergau drama, giving
up his New York theater to cinemato
graphic reproductions of it during the
theater season.
What will the New York press agent
not do to get his paragraphs printed
and copied?. Fanny Rice's paid poet
says that her New York theater will be
the most exclusive house in the coun
try, seating exactly 1000 persons, at
prices ranging from Two (2) to Five (5)
dollars a chair. Phew!
At the recent meeting of the incorpo
rated Society of Musicians in London
I Sir John Stainer discoursed earnestly
j on the question as to whether the state
j ought not to interfere In what is be
| coming a serious danger to musical life
i â the growing number of incompetent
j and brazen music teachers, whose op
l erations are often extended so ingeni
i ously that honest teachers are crowded
|to the wall. As the state protects mv-
I sical property by copyright he sees no
i reason' why it should not als6 interfere
|to save poor, confiding mothers and
widows from wasting their little all on
i charlatans. The speaker inclined to
the opinion that there ought to be a
! representative body, with statutory
I power of licensing teachers after duly
i testing their qualifications.

as the French vlvandiere, and Georgie
Cooper, Jennie Stockmeyer, Grade

California.
Black Patti's Troubadors will give
their opening performances to-night at
the California Theater. The first
sketch is called "At Jolly Coon-ey
Island," the scenery showing the "Bow
ery" of that famous Sunday resort. In
this sketch all the comedians and sing
ers of the company are given full sway
in a carnival of coon songs, buck
dances, cake-walks, glees, shouts and
jubilee choruses.
Then fallows an act of specialties cul
minating in what is described as a
"kaleidoscope of the opera." This
opera arrangement lasts forty minutes,
and includes concerted and solo selec
tions from "Trovatore," "Carmen,"
"Faust," "Bohemian Girl," "Grand
Duchess," "Cavalleria Rusticana," and
"The Daughter of the Regiment."
The company includes, besides Miss
Sissieretta Jones, the Black Pktti, who
sang at the Orpheum several seasons
ago, Ernest Hogan, comedian and a
well-known writer of coon songs; Mat
tie Philip, who is said to be a brilliant
exponent of the modern rag-timer, and
the Meredith Sisters, "Kid" Fraser,
Anthony D. Bird, Walter Richards,
Will H. Pierce, H. S. Wooton, Gustave
Hall, C. S. Bell, Tom Logan, Charles
L. Moore and Alice Mackay.
Columbia.
The Columbia is rapidly being put
into- shape and will reopen, handsomer
than ever, it is promised, on Friday
night, with the new star, Harry Corson
Clarke and his new company. Then
we shall find out just what did happen
to Jones.
Mr. Broadhurst's piece, "What Hap
pened tv Jones," which personally he
has been rehearsing for several weeks,
is a farcical comedy in four acts. The
story treats of one Ebenezer Goodly,
a professor of physical culture. His
family consists of a wife, her maiden
sister and two beautiful daughters.
They are expecting a visitor in the per
son of the Rev. Anthony Goodly, who
it appears has been living in the An
tipodes for over thirty years and has
been in constant correspondence with
his maiden sister-in-law. The first act
opens with the household in a flurry of
excitement and preparation, as he is
expected momentarily. In the mean
time a suitor for the hand of one of
Mr. Goodly's daughters induces Eben
ezer to accompany him to a glove con
test in the interest of anatomy, and,
after some persuasion, the professor
goes. The contest is supposed to take
place in a private club, and the police
raid the place.
The professor and the young man es
cape and are pursued by what they
suppose is a policeman, but who is
none other than a fellow-spectator,
who is being pursued himself. This
man enters the house a few minutes
after the professor, and after a few ex
planations relates how he has whipped
the policeman, and the complications
begin. This is Jones. He is a sort of
drummer, who lives by his wits, and
says, in explaining his business, that
"when he strikes a slow town he sells
prayerbooks, a lively town playing
cards." As the police are around and in
the house all the time they are com
pelled to shield Jones, and to the fam
ily he is introduced as the reverend
brother of Ebenezer. The spurious and
the genuine Revs. Goodly meet in
many situations that are pledged to be
funny. So the story complicates itself
through three acts.
In the company supporting Mr.
Clarke are his mother, Mrs. Adele
Clarke; Miss Affie Warner, J. B. Polk,
John Allison, Miss Maude Allison, Miss
Clara Rainford and H. S. Northrup.
OrpKeum.
Gautier and his horse are doing one
of the cleverest and most artistic acts
ever seen at the Orpheum. No one
should miss seine it. The Damm Broth

and the Nawns are still popular in their
Irish sketch.

fitting the personalities of the princi

evolved of a song, "The Serenade,"
which is sung by nearly every member
of the company, choruses included. The
Bostonians number seventy this season,
with a well -selected orchestra under the

Morosco's.
Harry Mainh.aH, the newly engaged
leading man of Morosco's stock com

part of John A. Stevens' melodrama,
"The Unknown." Mr. Mainhall is a
melodramatic actor of considerable
reputation. He played the leading role
in "Tennessee's Partner" at the Co
lumbia last year, and he is also remem
bered by many for his work in support
ing the tragedian, W. E. Sheridan, and â¢
as a prominent member of the old
Stockwell Company.
The play is well known on Mission
street and is of the exciting type that
pleases Morosco's patrons. The me
chanical and scenic effects will be well
cared for, and the prominent parts al
lotted to Maude Edna Hall, Julia Blanc,
Fred Butler, Landers Stevens, Morti

TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS
OF
CALIFORNIA
At the head of the work of the Moth
ers' Meetings Association in California
stands Mrs. E. G. Greene of Santa
Cruz. According: to Mrs. Wood, prin
cipal of the ijearst Grammar School,
San Francisco' is rather behind in this
movement, since such meetings have
been instituted thus far in only four of
our schools.
The San Francisco association was
organized last year and is composed
mainly of members of one section of
the Teachers' Club, which was formed
into a committee for the purpose of
studying home and school relations.
Of this committee Mrs. Wood was ap
pointed chairman, and Miss Pray sec
retary, and some of the other members
are Miss Keating;, Miss I* M. Wilson,
Miss Tiernan and Miss Ragan. How
ever, it is nut necessary to belong to
the Teachers' Club in order to become
a member of this committee.
Most of the teachers named above
are principals, which is generally a ne
cessity since to each naturally falls the
work of starting the meetings in the
various schools, personally superin
tending them, and inviting the parents
to co-operate. The pioneer meeting was
held in the Hearst Grammar School,
and later they were instituted in the
Bernal Heights, the Richmond and the
Emerson Primary. In the first jiamed
school the meetings occur twice a
month, but in the other schools but
once a month. To those all parents are
most earnestly and cordially invited.
In these meetings the parents and
teachers are brought in much closer
contact, with mutual benefit. Ques
tions of discipline, home study, lunch
hours, growth and treatment of chil
dren are freely discussed from the
home and school points of view, with
The result that the parents and teach
ers are enabled to work far better to
gether and assist one another in the
care and discipline of the children.
At the last meeting of parents at the
Hearst Grammar School the question
was raised. "Should parents be com
pelled to assist the teacher in d
plining the child?" This elicited â 
different-answers and resulted in a
interesting discussion. S >me pa
wished all the punishment carried out
at school; somf thought the main
cipline should be at home, and others
did not wish to be troubled at all in
the matter. Still other parents, realiz
ing that the teachers were generally
better acquainted with the daily de
portment and dispositions of their pu
pils, wished merely to co-operate in
the correction of their faults.
One lady reported to a certain prin
cipal that her small son, hitherto ex
ceedingly mischievous had recently sail
to her, 'â Mamma. I love my school: I'm
happier in it than I ever was before.
And I'm a good boy."
"I don't believe it," returned his
mother. "I'll ask your teacher."
Inquiry proved that the little fellow
had spoken truly, for his heart was in
his work and he had made rapid pro
gress in both studies and deportment.
But the attitude of distrust of the
mother toward her child is ac instance
of the harmful id^as which the teach
ers in the mothers' meetings are trying
to dispel. "Why." said the principal
t the boy's mother, "if your son knows
that you do not trust him, who can he
feel will?"

IN ALAMEDA.
From Alameda cnmeÂ« a report of the
p i '1 progress of the work in the En
cinal School, of which Charles C.
Hughes is principal. Mothers' meet
ings were begun last year, the school of
556 children being, divided into sections
and invitations to attend preliminary
meetings being sent to one section at
a time The invitations to the meetings,
which are held every third Friday
each month, read as follows:
"My dear parents: My teacher and
the principal of our school invite you
to meet with them on Friday, the 12th
of November, at 3 o'clock, for a pa
rents' and teachers' meeting. They
wish to become better acquainted with
you and have you freely discuss with
them the home and school training of
your children."
(Signed by the child.)
Mr. Hughes writes: "I used a novel
method of getting the parents out. I
did not call it a mothers' and teachers'
meeting merely, because I wished to
persuade some of the fathers also to
attend. But I suggested the above form
and had the children themselves write
out the invitations, under the super
vision of the teachers. These the pupils
carried home, taking a personal inter

come general. The attendance at the

'Home Work' was introduced. Open
i ing the discussion, I made a plea for
: nn >re and systematic reading alony the

graded according to the age of the
pupils, and the incentive and interest
aroused in them by teacher and par
ent. lam opposed to pupils taking for

trict Deputy A. G. Baker, assisted by j
Deputy Goldberg, in the presence of the |
grand officers and the members of the i

Under a wise school law. with he* 1
' public schools system from the pri
mary grade in the most remote, moun
tain district, to her universitiesyCali
fornia has swept aside the traditions
to which many of the older educational
circles still cling, and a harmony of
purpose coupled with a spirit of ag
gressive progression pervades her en-
tire educational atmosphere.
As 'an illustration ot the workings of
this system let us take one of the in
terior counties in the great Sacramento
Y;:)!'y. Coluea County, with a popu
lation of jess than 9000, showed, ac
cording to the last census, that out of
2108 children of school age 1701 are en
rolled in its schools, and nfty-six teach
ers are employed; of which one-fourth
are normal graduates. These schools
are divided Into twenty-four primary
and thirty-two grammar grades, which
constitutes a nine years' course.
But the educational work of the coun
ty does not end here, for four years
ago, discovering a wide gap between
graduation from the grammar school
and entrance to the State University,
in order to bridge this it 'was voted to
erect a high "school at the county seat.
As a consequence Colusa County an
nually furnishes her quota of students
to Berkeley, who are admitted without
further examination.
Finding this High School still inade
quate to meet the demands of the
growing number of grammar-school
graduates, the people in the southern
end of the county last August estab
lished the Pierce Joint-Union High
School at College City, it occupying the
spacious grounds and buildings of the
old Pierce Christian College. Both
these high schools contain a four years'
course, and the student has the option
of either a literary or scientific
course. There are at present just 100
high-school students.
At the head of public instruction, to
whom too great credit cannot be given,
stands the present County Superintend
ent, Mrs. Harriet L. Wilson.
Her late husband served in the same
capacity for ainv^t two terms, during
which time his wife was constantly as
sociated with him in the school work.
During the evening District Deputy F.
i A. Taylor, on behalf of the council, pre
1 si'iited to the retiring councilor, J. C. Ir
i vino, an emblematic badge, after which
j there was a grand march to the banquet
hall, where there was a tempting colla
tion. As v. souvenir each member and
guest was presented with a neat little
figure representing a stylish Japanese
. dame. On removing the upper part of the
| body there was disclosed in the skirt a
receptacle with -toothpicks. After the
collation dancing was resumed and a
most enjoyable time was had until mid
! nipht. The new officers who were in

EXPERIMENTS IN
HOME READING.
THE laws of California intend that
the pupils in the public schools
shall have the use of libraries
suited to the ages and desires of the
children. For the purchase of such
books and apparatus from $25 to 850
is set aside each year for library fund
from the county fund of each school dis
trict in the State.
The manner of selecting these books is
bo varied that many of the libraries are
almost worthless for the children. The
lovers of Dickens, Thackeruy, Scott and
Bancroft might enjoy days of reading
from libraries intended for primary chil
dren. The difficulty is to hold pupils in
school till we are able to give them the
desire and ability to read such books.
This task inspired the teachers of Mon
terey County in 1894 to begin a system of
experimenting to determine the tastes
and desires of pupils in the several
grades. This experimenting showed that
ages enjoyed fairy stories, elder
pupils would not read those, but enjoyed
history, biography and poetry. Evidently
It was our first duty to get pupils to read,
create the desire and then guide the pupil
In his efforts.
A list of supplemental readers for the
several grades was made. Teachers were
requested to use the books in school and
note the desire of pupils of certain ages.
At the close of the year, teachers were
prepared to discuss at the Institute the
following questions:
1. To what grade of pupils does each
of these books appeal most strongly?
2. Note what characters in the various
books appeal most strongly to particular
boys, to particular girls. Do children
admire characters who are most like
themselves, or those quite unlike them
selves?
3. Note the children's attitude toward
the fables read. If thoy do not like them,
why not? If they like them, why?
4. Note any scenes, or parts of books,
that are particularly attractive or unat
tractive to your classes. What are the
characteristics of these parts.
5. What are the principal difficulties
the children meet in reading these booksâ
construction, words, unfamiliar objects,
people or situations?

above questions.
A written report was expected on the
following questions:
(a) Give a list of the books read in
your school (of the foregoing list).
(b) What books in the list, if any,
proved too difficult for the grade as
signed?
(c) What was the average age of the
pupils that read "Montgomery's United
States History"? Has the Introduction
of history reading into the fifth grade
proved satisfactory?
entertainment and dance that was gotten
up to assfst the relief committee of the
circle in its work of assisting those poor
old soldiers and their families who are
in need. The price of admission was a
pound of anything that the committee
might distribute, and there were a num
ber of parcels received, some of them
weighing more than a pound. During the
evening there was between dances, given
a piano solo by Mrs. J. Murray Bailey,
recitation by Miss Bes3ie Harvey, vocal
solo by Mrs. Dickey and a recitation by
Mrs. A. Avers, president of the circle.
On the 24th inst. this circle will give a
grand Martha Washington tea. something
similar to the very successful one given
last year.
COMPANIONS OF THE FOREST.
During the past week the order suf
fered the loss of an active worker in the
sudden death of Mrs. Coralinn Sandber
ger, past grand inside guard and record
ing secretary of Justice Circle, from
rupture of an aneurism.
Last Monday the grand officers assisted
at the initiation of six candidates for
Mazzini Circle. On Tuesday Washington
Circle initiated two candidates. On
Wednesday the supreme grand chief and
the supreme grand secretary visited Lib
erty Circle and witnessed an initiation,
and on Friday night the same officers
visited Oak Leaf Circle at South San
Francisco.
A new circle will be instituted in New
Haven, Conn., next month, and one will
soon be instituted in Nevada County, in
this State.
AMERICAN LEGION OF HONOR.
Grand Secretary Burton visited nearly
all the local councilson the occasion of the
recent installations and there was in each
an evidence of revived interest.
During December and January death
claims amounting to $24,000 have been
paid in this State. At no time within the
past four years have claims in this State
been so nearly paid up.
Supreme Commander Downes in a let
ter to Grand Secretary Burton says that
during December 151 members were ad
mitted, 139 more passed the medical ex
aminer and were ready to be admitted,
while the returns for January show an
additional increase. Six new councils
were formed In December, making seven

(6) Does the time you give to reading
permit an extension of the list?
(c) Did your pupils find these books
more interesting than the reading book?
These experiments placed the reading
of history in the fifth grade in place of
the seventh, as in most counties. The re
sults are very satisfactory.
The results in supplemental reading
led to the appointment of a committee
on home readingâ that is, the selecting of
books for school libraries to be read by
the pupils of the several grades at home.
The same planâ the discovery and guiding
of the desires of puiiis â guided the com
mittee. A list was first carefully selected,
the books purchased by most of the
Boards of Trustees (the Boards of Trus
tees worked with its in most instances,
and bought such books as were recom-
nended) and submitted to the pupils.
At the next institute the committee
made a tabulated report from. the follow
ing questions:

same book 3

his trip south, during which he visited
the councils in the city of Los Angeles,
and on these visits he was accompanied
by GranÂ«l Vice-Councilor Bellinger. They
made official visits to John Adams, Uni

at each there was a good attendance of
members. The membership displayed
considerable enthusiasm. On the occa

It is the desire of the County Board of
Education to encourage the children to
read, and to cultivate a taste for the
kinds of reading that will lead to the
study of good literature. The plan
adopted is to lead the pupils as well as to
interest them. â¢
The work on supplemental and home
reading has continued since September,
1594. i Pupils and teachers alike are very
much interested in the reading of good
books. The interest, in language work,
composition ! and spelling has greatly in
creased. The committee consists of the

SAN DIEGO. Feb. 3, 1895.-The city
and county of San Diego have not
made much noise, in comparison
with other parts of the coast, dur
ing the pas,t year. No Klondikes
have been found, no School Board
semndaJa and no great catastrophes have
occurred. But the steady onward march
cf development and progress has been
uninterrupted. The pace, in fact, has ac
celerated, and perhaps no other city in
California can show the percentage of
increase of exports that San Diego en-
Joyed durlnpr 1597. The Custom-house fig
ures show that the exports by sea jumped
from $203,000 in 1896 to $440,000 in 1597. The
Increase in lemon and orange shipments
was fiit per cent, being 219 cars of lemons
and 162 cars of oranges during 1596 and
3SI cars of lemons and 224 cars of or
anges during 1597. The exports by the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company from
this port were: 1596, 5210 tons; 1597, 10,979
tons; Increase in one year, 5769 tons, or 110
per cent. If any city in California can
show this comparative increase in ship
ments the fact has not yet been published.
An indication of the manner in which
the country contiguous to San Diego has
grown is givon in the figures furnished
by the San Diego and Cuyamaca Railway
Company. This road runs into the inte
rior of San Diego County. Its tonnage in
creased 92.3 per cent during 1*97. The
fruit receipts at San Diego from various
county points, over this road, increased
3.040,330 pounds. Following are the fig

WHERE IS THE LOST HEIR OF
THIS FAMOUS ENGLISH ESTATE?
Arthur Augustus Percival, who was born '"> New Zealand forty-one years ago and spent his life in the capacity of sea
man, fireman, hackman, waiter and numerous other callings, disappeared from England a short time before the death of his
uncle, whose demise made him the only heir. Percival sailed for America, and that is the last known of him. He is very
likely suffering the pangs of poverty and the hardships of toil, while millions in money and vast estates are waiting for him.
SOMEWHERE among the inhabi
tants of this great earth there
"wanders a couple suffering all
the hardships of daily toil with
few of the pleasures of life, and
who struggle on all unconscious
that cue of England's proudest titles
and richest estates awaits them. They
fill some place in the lowly walks of
life, no doubt in their humble way fol
lowing their vocation to the satisfac
tion of a master, but as completely lost
to public notice as an individual atom
of the drifting sands of a desert. Their
fellow workmen rub up against them
ignorant of the fact that they are hob
nobbing with an earl and a countess.
The strange part of the story of Ar
thur Augustus Perceval and his wife,
for that is the couple referred to, is
that their whereabouts and history are
well known up to within a very short
time of their falling heir to the titles
and estates of an earldom.
Arthur Perceval has served as a com
mon sailor, later as first mate of a ship,
again as a London fireman, as a hack
man, a statesman and was last known
as janitor of the Town Hall at Chel-
Bea. England. An adventurous career
and a training quite unusual for a
British nobleman. However, his ad
ventures and mishaps are only in keep-
Ing with the peculiar spell of misfor
tune that has followed the family since
the time of Charles II of England. Now
that the young earl cannot be found is
quite in keeping with the strange ca
reer of the House of Edgmont, for that
ia the earldom that this man is heir
to.
Arthur Augustus Perceval was born
fnrty-one years ago in Papanui, near
Canterbury. New Zealand, to which
country his father had gone with his
young wife to escape a London scan
dal. Young Arthur at fourteen was
placed on board the training-ship Wor
cester to be educated for a naval ap
prentice. But his adventurous spirit
could not be curbed and his boyish
pranks got him into no end of trouble
with the officers. He spent more of
his time doing penance under the eye
of a guard than he did as a well-be
haved apprentice with the run of the
ship. One of his pranks caused him to
desert and changed his whole career.
One eVening just after sunset he had !
been assigned to cabin duty. He es- \
pled the captain asleep in a hammock
strung from a swinging boom. To cut !
the rope and tumble the captain out on ;
the deck was beneath his dignity. Such !
a commonplace trick waa not becoming ;
the name of Perceval. Something bet- i
ter than that must be done. He slowly
swung the boom over the side of the
ship, then cut the rope and dumped !
the captain into the sea. The serious- i
ness of his trick dawned upon him, and |
in the confusion of rescuing the cap- ;
tain, young Perceval let himself down
the side of the ship and swam ashore. ;
He landed near a country residence, j
and the rich man's son chanced to be j
walking in the garden. Young Perce- |
val aDDroached the boy and by some |

Water Company is composed principally j

water company, and Mr. Spreckels is
vice-president. Ihey are Interested in
many other important enterprises here I
besides the Coronado Beach interests,
and in fact are the moving spirits of San

at $3,500,000, and the cost of the system is

the growth of lemons, oranges, olives and j
other desirable and profitable fruits.

greater capacity than the present system.
This large municipal supply will enable
the city to give its inhabitants the lowest
water rate of any city In Southern Cali
fornia, which will mean the rapid de
velopment of fine lawns, grounds, parks
and orchards within the city limits. The
city Itself owns 8000 acres of old pueblo
lands, much of It suitable to fruit-grow
ing, and the application of water will In
crease the value of these lands to such an
t that the water will practically
cost nothing.
During 1n97 the Southern California
Mountain Water Company, on the au
pretext induced him to go down to the
beach. When on the beach and where
his cries for assistance could not be
heard, Arthur forced his newly made
acquaintance to disrobe and they ex
changed suits.
The dry suit was no sooner on him
than Arthur lit out as fast as his nim
ble legs would carry him. He spent
two weeks crossing the island, meeting
with all sorts of adventures as a tramp.
He came to a seaport and shipped as
a sailor boy on a small schooner for
Australia. He spent several years
cruising in the Chinese seas, and in 18*1
turned up in Lndon with a first mate's
certificate.
He had had enough of the sea, but
still hankered for adventure. He con
cluded that the life of a London fire
man offered more of the sort of sport
that he wanted than any other lands
man's vocation. He applied and wai>
admitted to the London Fire Brigade,
serving as a fireman in different parts
of South London for six years. Mean
time he had made himself known to the
seventh Earl of Edgmont at Cowdray
Park, Midhurst, who was his second
cousin. The late earl recognized in Ar
thur a possible heir to the earldom, and
tried to persuade him to abandon his
calling and attend college.
Arthur had about tired of his life as
a fireman, and it is said was seriously
considering the offers made him by the
late earl, when an American girl
stepped in and changed the whole pro
gramme. She was pretty, of course,
and her chic ways as a waitress in the
cheap restaurant near the engine-house
attracted the attention of Arthur Per
ceval. He forgot all about the old earl
and devoted his attentions to the wait
ress. He wen her regard and respect
by one day knocking out a big bully
who attempted familiarity with the girl.
From that day Arthur Perceval and
Kate Howell became the closest friends
and a few months later were married.
The pretty waitress is now described
in Burkes Peerage as "Kate, daughter
of AVarick Howell Esq. of South Caro
lina, IT. S. A." How she came to leave
her South Carolina home and wandered
to London and sought employment as
a waitress has never been told. The
young couple began housekeeping in a
humble way, but happy, nevertheless.
Arthur Perceval soon began to be
known as one of the best and most dar
ing firemen on the South Side. The
training at sea had accustomed him to
climbing dizzy height?, and he feared
neither flames nor accident. His brav
ery won for him the approbation of
his chief, and on one occasion a reward
of Â£50 from a merchant whose build-
Ing he had risked his life to save. The
earl was very much incensed at Arthur
for choosing matrimony and the fire
department rather than a college life.
Soon after the wedding Arthur wrote
to the old earl hinting that congratula
tions wore in order. The earl curtly
replied that he hoped his cousin would
find both the fire department and mat
rimony closely akin so far as a good
wnrm time was concerned, and further
more suggested that if Arthur did not
find either quite wnrm enough he
might, by again addressing Earl of
Edgmont, learn of a place that bore
the renutation of being: several degrees

thorlty of its officials, expended $1000 per
day for every working day, and has done
so ever since the city voted the bonds, in
June, 1596. The consequence has been
that every branch of business in the city
has felt the benefit of the construction
work, even before there was any direct
benefit to the lands themselves.
The United States Government has
recognized the importance of San Diego
harbor by expending large sums for
harbor defense and improvement. The
work of defending this bay is going on
very rapidly, more rapidly In proportion
than at any other harbor on the coast.
The contractor building the gun em
placements has had a force of 100 men at
work night and day for more than a year
at Ballast Point, and the result is that
within a month two 10-inch disappearing
rifles of the most modern type will be
pointing seaward, and another will- be be
ing assembled. Work on the fourth em
placement is to be started shortly, and
these four guns will complete the battery
at Ballast Point.
Then. on Point Loma, two more bat
teries will be placed. Two 8-inch guns
will defend the extremity of the point
and two 10-in<-h non-disappearing rifles
will crown the heights. Near by will
be a mortar battery of thirty-two
12-Inch mortars, firing each a pro
jectile weighing 1000 pounds. An
other mortar battery of the same size
will be placed on the sandsplt a mil'
south of Hotel del Coronado. The tor
pedo casemates, sunk in the bay, will
complete the defenses of San Diego.
Of this work there has actually bee:

hotter than any fire London had yet
experienced.
Arthur and his young -wife only
laughed at the wrathy old earl, and
continued on in their own quiet way
to enjoy life. A few months later came
a fire at which Fireman Perceval dis
tinguished himself by scaling a danger
ous wall and by playing a stream
stopped the progress of the fire, sav
ing a big warehouse. The owner pre
sented Perceval with a Â£10 note, and
the favorable press comments on the
work of the daring fireman attracted
the Earl of Edgmont's attention. What
seems to have impressed him most was
the smallness of the reward, for he
wrote to Arthur stating that if the old
merchant did not know a good thing
an Edgmont did, and with the letter
came a check for Â£50.
At another time Perceval risked his
life to save that of a child. The crusty
old earl heard of this and wrote a very
curt letter advising his cousin that If he
must risk his neck to do it in saving
buildings that cost piles of money to
replace, and not in the saving of mere
kids, the like of which filled the streets
and crowded the foundling asylums'
This time he sent only Â£25. This dis
gusted Perceval, and he concluded then
and there to throw up his badge and
helmet.
By the intercession of friends he
secured the position of Janitor of the
new Town Hall" at Chelsea. This was
a job in which the perquisites of of
fice exceeded tfie salary. Peceval had
knocked about the world and rubbed
up against all sorts and conditions of
men and learned how to take ad
vantage of such a position. He had
carefully put aside every penny do
nated by the old Earl, and with his
savings as a janitor was soon in a.
position to go into business on his own
account.
He bought an interest in some ce
ment works, but the venture did not
prove a success. He sold out at a
loss, and from that day to this has not
been heard from. A few weeks after
the closing out of his interest in tho
cement works the old Earl died, leav
ing Arthur heir to his title and es
tates. Attorneys and others have
searched the world over for the heir
but the new Earl and his American
wife seem to have wandered to some
out-of-the-way place where the news
of their good luck has not followed.
The general supposition is they left
for America, expecting to find some of
her people, and when they landed
changed the'r minds and went West
If they came to the United States
they did so under assumed names, for
the passenger lists do not reveal' the
name of Perceval. There Is no known
reason why Arthur should choose to
take another family name, yet it is
not surprising if he did so, for it runs
in the Egmont blood to do strange
and unaccountable things.
One time -when Arthur was a boy
at home in Papanua he was sadly in
need of pocket money. He was afraid
to nsk his father for It, as he had al
ready overdrawn his allowance. A
case of French sardines, something of
a luxury in that far-off land, had re
cently arrived and had been placed in
the storeroom. Arthur figured that the
sardines were not likely to be called
the completion of a torpedo casemate
near by. The public is not permitted to
know what the torpedo casemate con
tains nor what is its offensive and defen
sive power.' The Government en
gineers state, however, that the most
modern armament only is being employed
for the coast defenses, both at San Diego
and San Francisco. The total cost of
San Diego's defenses, as outlined, is esti
mated to be $1,500,000.
San Diego Harbor, the pride of every
resident of the city and the envy of her
neighbors, is being improved by the con
struction of a Jetty at the east side of the
harbor mouth. At this point the Zuninga
shoals have worked harm by dividing the
flow of the tides, dissipating their
strength and causing the piling up of a
shoal at the right of the entrance. The
tides have not scoured the bar and chan
nel as they would have done but for the
Zuninga shoal. The Government hus
built a jetty, running from the east side
of the harbor mouth seaward a mile and
a half, which confines the tides to a

ANCHOR IN SAN DIEGO HARBOR.
straight course in and out of the bay.
Thus the tremendous force of the tides
is used to scour the channel and deepen
the water over the bar.
Though the jetty has been completed
for for some time, so he put the case
on the wheelbarrow and wheeled it
downtown and sold the whole case to
n grocer. A few days after the father
began a hunt for the sardines. Arthur
owned up as to how they had disap
peared and told the figure at which he
had sold the case. The father looked
at him a miute, put his hand in his
pocket and handed him a sovereign,
remarking. "You sold them too cheap:
you should have got at least a
sovereign more. Here it is. My boy,
whenever you take a notion to sell
the roof from over my head see that
you pet full market value for it."
Arthur was placed in boarding
school after boarding-school, but in
each instance with the same ending
he either played some unforgivable
prank and was sent home or if the
discipline was too severe he ran away.
It was because the list of boarding
schools had been exhausted that he
came to be placed on board a train
ing-ship, and how he escaped from it
has been told.
He seems to have turned out a profi
cient seaman, else he could not have
obtained a first mate's certificate at
the early age of 23. Of his adventures
at sea little is known, but his com
rades in the London Fire Department
describe him as a rattling good fellow.
While he was Jovial and fond of com
pany and joking, he was inclined to
be non-communicative. It Is due to
this characteristic probably that he
has never written any of his old
friends.
The strange part of the disappear
ance of the new Earl and the Countess
is that he should have gone to some
unknown point just at the time of the
death of the old Earl. It was just
three weeks after Arthur Perceval
sold his interest In the cement works
that the death of the old Earl was
widely proclaimed in the English and
Continental papers. Advertisements
and rewards for information as to Ar
thur's whereabouts appeared in nearly
every part of the world, but up to the
time of publication of the latest Lon
don newspapers that have come to
hand Arthur is still a wanderer and
unknown. When he does turn up he
will find that he is Earl of Egmont,
"Viscount Perceval, Baron Perceval and
Baron Arden in the peerage of Ireland,
Baron Lovel and Holland In the peer
age of England, Baron Arden in the
peerage of the United Kingdom, and a
Baronet of Ireland, to say nothing of
a few minor titles.
The family seems to have been un
der a peculiar spell of misfortune. The
late Earl's father died of jail fever,
contracted from the prisoners he was
trying at Cork; his uncle was myste
riously assassinated in the Strand,
London, in the reign of Charles II; his
grandfather was the famous Spencer
Perclval.
The present Earl's misfortune seems
to be in his having lost himself just at
the time when he ought to be very
much in evidence.
only 4400 feet, the good effects of the
work are already noticeable. The so
called middle-ground channel has been
deepened and the bar is scoured several
inches. The old Zuninga shoal is a thing
of the past, and deep water exists where
it formerly stood. Thus the finishing
touch upon San Diego's priceless harbor
has been made. The harbor, as is well
known, is the safest haven on the coast,
and the equal of San Francisco's lordly
bay except in size. Mariners are invari
ably pleased with San Diego harbor, and
praise it for its shelter.
The shipping through San Diego har
bor Increased largely during 1897. In 1596
the harbor was visited by 367 domestic
and foreign vessels, with a tonnage of
192,058. In 1897 the number of vessels in
creased to 422, and the tonnage increased
to 220.833. The only deep-sea ships leav
ing Southern California with cargoes dur
ing 1597 were from San Diego Bay.
The most important commercial institu
tion completed during 1897 was the San
Diego brewery, at a cost of $175,000. The
capacity of the brewery is 66.000 barrels
per year, and the capacity of the stock
house, 25.000 barrels, is to be Increased
because of the surprising demand for the
product. Mexico, Southern California,
Arizona and New Mexico are supplied by
the brewery. Another growing industry
is the shipment of fresh fish to the East.
The teeming waters of the bay and ocean
give up their food to supply such distant
points as the City of Mexico, Chicago,
and all the Middle West. The fish is
shipped In ice, and arrives in splendid
condition. At first there was a prejudice
in favor of Atlantic Ocean fish, but con
sumers were forced, after trial, to the
conclusion that the Pacific Ocean fur
nishes just as good meat as its smaller
neighbor.
A movement that is believed to have the
most Important bearing on the future of
this county has begun on a small scale,
in the culture of tobacco. Several inde
pendent and enterprising men, who had
had experience in the South, began in a
small way to cultivate tobacco in El
Cajon Valley, near this city, and proved
to the world that a product not inferior
to any tobacco grown in the United States
could be grown in this county. This
small beginning has already grown into
an industry of some importance, and is
engaging the attention of growers and
manufacturers. Specimens of San Diego
County tobacco submitted to some of the
largest manufacturers of the East and
South brought forth the most enthusiastic
praise for the product.
The San Diego County Tobacco Grow
ers' Association was formed as a result
of these experiments, and now a number
of ranchers are trying the cultivation of
the weed, on plats of ground running
from five to fifty acres in extent. While
many of these will no doubt prove fail
ures through the ignorance of the grower,
GEORGE BROADHURST`S EXPERIENCE
IN WRITING FOR THE STAGE
When Mr Broadhurst was manager of the old Bush-street Theater, Bronson Howard advised him to try his hand at
play-writing. The latter gave him several valuable hints on the way to test the public on situations and dialogue. What
clever use "the young man made of the suggestions is told in the following story.
THE other evening, at the Cali
fornia Theater, a sedate, be
spectacled, blonde young man
left his seat and crossed to the
other side of the house, where
he shook hands and chatted
cordially with M. B. Leavitt, who not
so long since reigned supreme in the
theatrical world in this city.
When the blonde young man walked
away Mr. Leavitt said to his com
panion: "Five years ago I met that
young man in Grand Forks, N. D.,
where' he was managing the theater
and running the daily paper. He got
so much the best of an argument re
gardmg a contract which he wanted
for one of my attractions that I im
mediately engaged him to manage
my theater in Chicago. Soon after I
transferred him to the Bush Street
Theater here. At that time he had
not written a line for the stage, but
this year two of his plays, both suc
cesses, were running at the same
time in Broadway houses."
George A. Broadhurst is the man who
jumped from the snows of North Da
kota to the sunny side of the metropo
lis in five years. He was the last man
ager of the Bush Street Theater under
Mr. Leavitt's administration, and it
was while occupying that position
that he first thought of trying his pen
at dramatic writing.
"The idea of doing this," said Mr.
Broadhurst, "was suggested to me by
Bronson Howard. During the en
gagement of Mrs. W. J. Florence he
came to the office of the theater to
request the courtesy of a box for one
of her performances. We chatted
awhile, and then the conversation
veered to Mr. Sothern's production of
'The Maister of Woodbarrow,' which
was the current attraction at the
Baldwin. Mr. Howard had not seen
the play and requested my opinion of
it. I said that I thought that the
scene in which Mr. Sothern put on
his gloves was too long, and being
asked for my reasons I answered that
the audience began to move uneasily
and to rustle their programmes.
" 'That,' said Mr. Howard, 'is a sure
sign. Whenever I have a new pro
it has been absolutely demonstrated, be
yond question, that tobacco of a fine qual
ity can be grown in this county, and that
is sufficient to bring about vast results
in due time.
So far as the city proper Is concerned, it
is growing at a healthy and satisfactory
rate. The population, as shown by the
school statistics, is on the increase at a
rapid ratio. The schools are crowded to
such an extent that several hundred chil
dren are denied the privileges of attend
ance. The city proposes to increase its
school facilities by voting bonds for a new
high school, to be the equal, in size and
architectural beauty, of the fine buildings
already in use.
The act passed by the last Legislature,
providing for the construction of a State
normal school in this county, has been
followed to the extent of appointing a
board of trustees, choosing a beautiful
site on University Heights, in this city,
and advertising for plans and specifica
tions for the preliminary building. The
cost of the whole building will be $100,000.
but on account of the fact that only $50,000
was appropriated and the great need of
immediate work the trustees have devot
ed $35,000 to the preliminary building and
the balance to teachers' salaries and
equipment. The preliminary building will
be so constructed as to become a part of
the larger bullcHng.
The construction of business blocks and
tine private residences has continued un
interruptedly during the past year. The
attractions of this city and Coronado to
persons of culture and refinement looking
for a permanent home in a congenial cli
mate are such as to bring- about the erec
tion of Ideal homes, surrounded with
semi-tropical vegetation, and command
ing views of charming, varied scenery, in
which glorious sunshine and summer's
magic touch are the benign influences
which make all residents here so loyal
and zealous lovers of the place.
So, with resources of soil and climate,
facilities for commerce, and blessed by
nature, San Diego presents to the home
seeker a variety of attractions such as
are not offered by any other one city on
the Pacific Coast. IRA E. BENNETT.
MEMORIES OF THE CIVIL WAR
Soroe Stirring Incidents of an Ex
pedition Down t\)<z Coast.
"The first time I ever heard guns
fired in earnest," said the old soldier,
"was in a storm at sea; from troops on
a transport that was foundering. There
were a lot of troops, twenty thousand
or so, on vessels, bound on an expedi
tion down the coast. Besides the trans
ports there were a lot of navel vessels
of all sorts. And then there were some
vessels in tow, with supplies and sub
sistence stores. The steamer that my
regiment was aboard had a ship in tow.
Altogether it was a fleet of fifty ves
sels or more. We went along down the
coast slow and easy, so as to keep to
getherâno use of getting there piece
meal, because nothing could be done
till all were thereâ and so as to accom
modate the slower boats and those that
were towing others.
"We had one day of bad weather that
finally worked up into a storm. There
was a high sea all day, and the ship
we had in tow charged over it at a
sreat rate. Sometmes when the steam
er's nose was in a valley and her stern
in the air, looking astern from her after
deck you couldn't see the lower masts
of the sY-Ap we were towing. All you
could see was her topmasts, and to'gal
lantmasts and upper yards. The ship
was out of sight in the valley. Next
minute the steamer's bow would be in
the air and her stern buried, and then
looking at the ship, as she rose up on
a great wave behind us you could see
her forefoot. A minute later the steam
er's stern would be in tho air again and
the ship would be sliding down the face
of the wave into the valley. It seemed
duction I watch the audience even
more closely than I do the criticisms,
and if they show signs of restlessness
during any scene I promptly cut it.
During the production of 'Shenan
doah' in Boston I noticed how thor
oughly absorbed the audience was in
the signals on the mountains and I
determined to try an experiment. I
said to the stage manager, "Continue
the signals until I tell you to cease,"
and then I stood in the prompt en
trance listening alertly ror the first
uneasy cough or rustle of pro
grammes. I waited in vain so Ion?
that I lost my nerve and gave the cue
for the resumption of the play proper.
Next night I determined to see it
through, no matter how long it took,
and so gave the stage manager the
same instructions as before. I waited
four minutes by the watch, and then
gave up in despair. It was my last
experiment of this nature, and so my
curiosity was never satisfied.'
"Mr. Howard called several times
after thia and discussed plays and
players quite thoroughly. While leav
ing after his last call Mr. Howard
said: 'You ought to try to write a
play. I think you have the dramatic
instinct.' The seed took root more
firmly perhaps than expected. I did
try, and the result was my first play,
'The Speculator.' It dealt with lire on
the Chicago Board of Trade, and I
had the advantage of knowing my
subject thoroughly, as I was connect
ed with the institution for five years.
'The Speculator' was produced by
Thomas Q. Seabrooke and ran for two
seasons.
"My next attempt was 'The Wrong
Mr. Wright,' which was written for
Roland Reed and first produced at the
Boston Museum in August, 1896.
"The reception accorded my first two
plays having shown me that I had
some aptitude for writing for the stage
I determined to produce my next piece
myself. After considering the matter
I concluded that the trend of public
taste was toward the romantic and the
farce. Feeling that I was not as yet
competent to write the former I tried
my hand at the latter. The result was
'What Happened to Jones.' What
happened to 'What Happened to
Jones' is now a matter of record.
"While 'What Happened to Jones' is
being presented in New York and Chi
cago it will also be seen in this city,
as Harry Corson Clarke has purchased
the rights of presentation weÃt of the
as though It was about the limit of
towing and I almost wondered they
didn't cut her loose.
"As the day went on the weather got
worse and night shut in early, with
the sky overcast and the wind blow
ing a gale, the sea rougher than ever,
and vessels all around us rolling and
tossing. We had heard once or twice,
just before dark, when the blasts of
wind had let up a little, sounds of fir
ing to windward, and we knew therÂ«
must be a vessel there in distress. Af
ter nightfall we could see in the dis
tance the flash of the guns; the vol
ley firing of men apparently drawn up
in line on deck. It wasn't our place
to help them, there were many vessels
nearer. They had all the help it was
possible to give them. We learned
later that nearly all on the vessel were
saved. There were about twenty-five
lost.
"When we came on deck on our ship
the next morning we saw something
that interested us very much; the up
per part of the after chimneyâ the
steamer had two smokestacks, rang
ing fore and aftâ had been carried
away completely, and It lay on deck
over on the port side of the ship. On
the starboard side, a boat hanging on
davits had been smashed, and the
steamer's rail cut down to the deck.
This damage had been done by the
ship we had in tow. Her jibboom had
poked off the upper sections of the
smokestack and her cutwater had
smashed the boat and cut down the
rail. According to the story aboard
we had occasion in the night to back.
The story was that there were break
ers ahead. When we went astern the
ship kept coming, and came aboard of
us on the starboard quarter. They
cut her loose as soon as they could,
and the men on the ship made sail on
her. She hadn't done us very much
damageâ l have sometimes wondered
what would have happened if she had
struck us a little harrier blow.
"We went on easily enough with one
long and one short chimney. We were
going slow and we didn't need the
draught that we lost through the cut
ting down of one of them. We didn t
pick the ship up again, but we saw her
a few days later, at our port of desti
nation, trim and all right. It hadnt
disturbed her to be cut loose in the
storm, in fact. I have no doubt that
she liked it so much better.
THE MATTER OF WHISKERS.
London Truth.
The day he went to the Palais de
l'lndustrie to inform the Emperor and
Empress of the Archduke Maximilian s
execution the revealing whiskers fell
quite lank. They recovered their tri
umphant air soon after, to lose it on
September 4. They certainly did not
recover that air at Tours or Bordeaux,
where Prince Metternich looked very
much the fish out of water. Jules
Ferry's whiskers were often an index
to his state of feeling. I saw him on
the day he escaped from the Commune
of Paris to Versailles. He related his
adventures at the Hotel dcs Reser
voirs to friends who gathered round
him The whiskers which habitually
stood well out like those (his enemies
said) of a garcon de cafe, were limp,
and lay flat to the cheeks.
The most leonine whiskers I ever saw
were Skobeleff's. They were of im
mense length when he drew them out,
as was his wont, but when let alone
seemed only half as long. I dare say
they had their lank days, but not so
far as I know. The term "whlskeran
do" (now well nigh obsolete) had more
meaning than those who used it
thought.
: Missouri River, and rehearsals for Its
production have already commenced.
I Although Mr. Clarke pays for the piece
' the biggest royalty ever given an Am
i erican author, this would not have
tempted me had I not thought he was
unusually well adapted for the part of
Jones, to whom various things happen
during the course of, to him, a very
eventful evening. The rights of pro
duction in Germany, Australia and
South Africa have also been sold, and
arrangements are practically completed
whereby the farce will be seen in 'Lon
don next season under the manage
ment of my brother and myself.
'"We had a peculiar experience re
garding the copyrighting of "Jones' in
England. In that country no play can
be produced unless it has been sanc
tioned by the public censor, a provision,
by the way, which would work for the
benefit of the stage in this country.
One of the characters is the Bishop of
Ballarat. and during last summer I was
surprised to receive a cable from Miss
Elizabeth Marbury, the well known
play agent, who was looking after our
London interests, saying: "Censor re
fuses license. Objects to Bishop.' For
a time I was very much puzzled as to
the ground for his objection. There is
no word in the play derogatory to the
dignity of the cloth, and many comedy
ministers have been portrayed on the
English stage, notably those in 'The
Private Secretary,' and 'In Town." Var
ious reasons suggested themselves as to
the cause of the censor's action, but
they were all dismissed as being un
likely and trivial. After a while, how
ever* I struck what I thought, was the
right one, so I cabled Miss Marbury:
'Reduce Bishop to curate and try it.'
Two days aft-^r word came, 'License
granted.' ___________

TRY THESE VERY SIMPLE PARLOR TRICKS.
Marvelous Things That May Be Done by Any Amateur
Juggler.
THE spinning handkerchief is a
great favorite with jugglers.
A handkerchief is borrowed,
thrown in the air and caught on
the end of a whirling stick held
by the juggler, when the hand
kerchief spreads out to its full size and
commences to rapidly spin around. The
secret, says W. B. Caulk, In the cur
rent number of the Scientific Ameri
can, is that in the end of the stick a
needle is inserted about a quarter of an
inch, leaving the sharp end out. When
the handkerchief is caught on the end
of the whirling stick the needle point
passes through it, thus preventing it
falling off the stick, which is rapidly
whirled around, and the handkerchief
will spread out and spin about on the
end of the stick.
Jugglers are very partial to tricks
performed with eggs, and spinning an
egg on its smaller end is a trick they
are almost sure to perform. It is im

possible to spin a raw egg, so our jug
gler uses a hard-boiled one, and spins
it on its small end in a shallow
japanned tray. If the tray is kept
gently moving in a small circle in the
opposite direction to that in which the
egg is spinning the latter will continue
to spin as long as desired.
The egg-spinning trick is usually fol
lowed by a balancing trick, in which a
playing card is balanced upon a small
wand, and fp\ egg is then balanced
on a corner bt the card. This trick
usually calls forth a great pretension
of skill on the part of the performer,
when in reality no skill whatever is re
quired.
The wand is pf ebony or some dark
wood, and about three inches from
one end is a small hole. The egg is
made of wood, painted white, and with
a small hole in one end. The card is
composed of two cards glued together,
with a fine steel wire between them,
running diagonally from corner to cor
ner of the card, with the ends of the
wire projecting about a quarter of an
Inch.
The prepared egg Is on a plate with
several ordinary eggs, and the card is
placed on a pack of common cards.
The wand is held In one hand, the card
taken in the other and apparently bal
anced on one corner on the wand, but
in reality the wire point is placed in
the hole in the wand. Now the assist
ant passes the prepared egg to the jug
gler, who carefully balances it upon
the corner of the cardâ that is, slips
the hole in the end of the egg over the
wire point projecting from the card.

A fitting finale to such a juggling act
is that in which a potato is placed on
the hand of the assistant and cut in
two with a sharp sword without leav
ing any mark upon the skin. As a gen
eral thing, a. second potato is then cut
upon the throat of the assistant. This
apparently marvelous mastery of the
sword always brings forth great ap
plause.
Taking several medium-sized sound
potatoes, on a tray are placed two po
tatoes prepared as follows: Insert a
needle crosswise of the potato, near the
bottom. After showing the sword to
be really sharp by cutting paper and
slicing one or two of the potatoes, the
performer picks up one of the prepared
potatoes and places it on the assist
ant's hand. But apparently it does not
lie to suit him, so he slices off one side
of it, using care to cut away the side
just under the needle and as close to
it as possible: then he places the po
tato once again on the assistant's
hand. After making a few flourishes
with the sword he cuts through the po
tato, dividing it in half.
In striking the potato with the sword
he makes sure that the sword will
come exactly crosswise on the needle;
consequently, when the sword reaches
the needle it can go no further, and the
brittle nature of the potato will cause
it to fall apart, the very thin portion
below the needle offering no resistance
to the separation. The second potato
is then cut in the same manner on the
assistant's neck. There are many other
false juggling tricks, but the above
will suffice to show that "there are
tricks in all trades but yours"

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 5â To-day's stock mar-
Ja-l was lifted to a higher level by the con
'eplcuoiis strength of comparatively few stocks.
It was noteworthy that the Vanderbflts, which
gave the initial impetus to yesterday's ad-
vance, showed tho effects to-day of profit tak
. Ing, Lake Shore losing- two points and New
York Central a small fraction. Michigan Cen
tral, aft?r bounding upward at the opening,
reacted over a point, but closed with a sub-
stantial gain. The tar-reaching importance of
the merging of Ntw York Central and Lake
phore and the prospects of additions to the
plan continued to have a marked sentimental
effect all along the lino. PoMibiUtiM In the
way of reduced expenditure for administration
and of stability of rates for traffic from Con
solidation are canvassed with eager attention by
dealers in securities. Great Northern preferred
sold at a further decline of two points and
was bid down still further, the various reports
of plans for increased capitalization' and dis
tribution of the companies- accumulated re
sources' being so conflicting as to lead to the
conviction that no j plan has . yet been formed.
Although business was on a large scale and
widely distributed the fluctuations in price
were exceedingly narrow outside of the special

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
I CHICAGO. Feb. For a few minutes around
the opening Wheat, was inclined to sympathize
with the' action of the Liverpool market. That
market, after opening a little higher, declined
and closed I nÂ®%d lower in the face of yes
terday's improvement here. On this account
first 7 sales of May were at a slight' decline.
May opening at :'<4"<.*i.9;,r, against yesterday's
closing price of 95ViC Besides the Liverpool
decline Northwest receipts continued heavy. A
rather ' bearish showing of tne visible was
looked ; for Monday, and ; New York reported
â moderate selling at the opening for foreign
account. Notwithstanding all this the market
became strong almost immediately. Moderate
buying by the long Interests principally sup
plemented -by- a : little covering by . St. Louis
brokers of lines put out yesterday, carried the
.price of. May steadily up to 96^@95%c. The
advance wai helped by the -continued .strength
of Oats and Provisions, both of . which mar
kets made new prices for the season . during
the â¢ morning; -There were reports of grain
famine from parts of Southeastern â¢ Russia,
and California â¢ reported a continuation of the
drought. A factor In the advance â¢ was the
report that the reduction in the : Italian grain
duty would probably remain in ; effect until
the last of May. . : Prices eased off slowly, but
closing Paris cables caused another brief
period of strength. Paris was from 40 to 65
centimes higher for Flour and 10 to 30 centimes
higher - for Wheat. During the i last hour of
. the session â¢ prices gradually receded. . May
closed at 95c. . â  â ;-â ; ,
Corn was firm,' but dull. May closed un

THE FINANCIAL SITUATION.
NEW YORK, Feb. s.â The Financier says:
The statement of the New York clearing house
banks for the week ending February 5 is
notable as reflecting the ability of the banks
to absorb nnd put to more or lone profitable I
use the immense accumulation of funds at this j
center. The aggregate deposits of the sixty- j
five institutions are nearly $334,000,000. What j
this means will be better appreciated when it
is stated that it is an increase of $lG:>,Of>0,000 |
over the same week last year and $241,060,000 i
in excess of the deposit item for the similar
period of 1596.
The increase in loans for the past sfic days
was $7,994,100, which is pretty evenly dis
tributed among eight or ten leading banks,
one institution only showing a more than ordi
nary- decrease. The expansion in deposits was
$11,343,100. and the banks gained in cash *2,005,- !
000. The loan increase and the cash addition
do not account for the deposit growth, t J t>
discrepancy amounting to. $1.343.<>0<), hut this [a
due perhaps to the confusing system of aver- i
ages employed in making the statement. The j
banks are still gaining heavily in cash from i
the interior, although domestic exchange at |
important centers shows decided weakness as j
compared with two weeks ago, reflecting. It is ;
to be presumed, the cessation of Interest remit- !
tances to New York. The payment .of several
millions of Union Pacific deposits into the !
treasury has no appreciable effect on the mar- j
ket, but it Is to be noted that the excess re- |
serve of the banks is down $827,825, and with
anything like a continued showing such as
made in the current statement rates will prob
ably be steady in tone. Anything more than
a moderately firm basis, however, seems the i
qut-stion for a considerable period.
The reserve investments by American inter
fsts abroad are in the mturÂ» of a safety valve
to check sudden fluctuations upward.
EASTERN LIVESTOCK MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. s.â There was the usual Sat
urday lack of offerings In cattle and the mar
ket was largely a nominal one. The few sales
made r w.ere at yesterday's! ranÂ£e of prices. .Tim.
market this week has been a fairly strong .one
and prices have advariced lO'Jrloc on beef steers,
there being sharp competition - for fat cattle.
Sales were ; largely at $4 25@3 10. the extreme
range of prices being $4@5 40 for common to
strictly choice. t â¢ â¢â¢â¢ â¢â  â¢ :
â¢ There â  was an . active demand for hogs and
prices were up to yesterday's best time, prime
heavy hogs fetching $4. From that figure sales
were made all the way down to $3 70, the bulk
of the hogs crossing the scales at $3 S.V.. 92,4.

largely at $3 80414 60. Yearling sheep brought

TIRED DRUGGISTS.
An â¢ association of employing and!
working druggists of New York, called j
the "Druggists' League for Shorter j
Hours," wants a law passed, applica- j
ble to all cities of the first class in New j
York State, prohibiting drug clerks j
from working more than twelve hours |
on Saturdays, four hours on Sundays
and holidays, and ten hours on other
days; and also prohibiting them from j
sleeping in the shop. The league says
that at present drug clerks work four
teen hours a day, and get tired and
make mistakes in compounding pre
scriptions; and that night clerks sleep
on cots in the back of the shop, which
is unhealthy. The league doesn't think
many all night clerks are needed, and
says that half the drug stores do with
out them as it is.
The proposed law recommends itself
to the thoughtful consideration of pa
trons of drug stores. It cannot be al
together satisfactory to work fourteen j
hours a day and sleep in an atmosphere
of drugs. If you think that a man who j
does that is likely to sell you morphine \
when you ask for quinine, by all means j
keep away from that man and- the shop
that employs him. Look attentively
at the drug clerks before you trust
them, and if they seem drowsy or over
worked or drugged or otherwise ir
responsible, go to some other shop.
Drug clerks should be maintained in
good mental condition, and the practice
lof overworking them is contrary to
public policy, and ought to be discour
aged. Whether it is prevalent enough
to require legal prohibition is matter
for experts to determine. Among those
who think that it is and favor Sic pro
posed bill are the Household Economic
Association, the Consumers' League
and the Social Reform Club. â Harper's
Weekly. â¢

NEWS OF THE MINES.
New Life and Progress
Fills the Mining In
dustry Everywhere.
The Advertising Opportunities
of the State â Old Corn
stock Dream Revived.
What the mining Interests of Upper and
Central California wul <io iÂ» tho way of
providing a creditable mining exhibit for
the Transmissiesippi Exposition has be
come a live question with the appoint
ment of a public spirited committee to
promote the work. Southern California
lias been awarded 2000 feet of space, and
if the rest of the State is going to rise
to the occasion also there must be prompt
action. There is no question as to the
groat advertising: value to this State of
a striking showing of the mineral re
sources and opportunities for California
to the throe or four millions who will at
tend the exposition. The question is only
as to the degree of enterprise with which
the opportunity will be seized. Several
mining counties ami the State at large
will be well rewarded by the Mining Fair.
Now there should be :t great permanent
mining exhibit added to the collection of
the State Board of Trade, and a large
exhibit sent to Omaha. The matter of
what California will do about proclaim
ing its mineral wealth to the world at
Paris in 1900 soems doomed to wait until
tho Legislaiuie meets and decides the
matter of an appropriation. There is a
source of fcrr;u advertising opportunities
ahead for the mining industry of the
State.
Theundyinghope that the Comstock will
recover some of its departed glory is be
ing again revived by a .iis.-ussion of the
possibilities and practicability of pump
ing out the d< epest levels which have
been so long ;: Led and abandoned, and
fainkw.K deeper in quest of new bonanza.-;.
Tins ueems feasible to mining men and
the thing may be tried some of these
days, especially ir me prospecting of the
Brunswick lode keeps on disappointing.
The de< pest shaft reached ii^Oo leet. and
on the 3000-foot level good ore and indi
cations were round in the Belcher, Jacket
and Hale and Norcross. 'i his was m
liflfi, and the pressure for dividends
prompted an abandonment of deep work
ing and a return to the unwonted ore
bodies in the upper levels, which yielded
millions before their riches were exhaust
ed. As pumping operations would be
conducted on the ii I*'1 *' level, that of the
Sutro tunnel, there is but about 1500 feet
to unwater. As the chances are good
that un reached bonanzas lie below the
workings, there is a fainy good
promise that the enterprise will be car
ried out one of these days, and that Vir
ginia City may again hum with life. But
so far it is all Interesting discussion.
In reviewing the lead industry for the
year, with its boom in production and its
rising prices, the St. Louis Republic sayt>:
"St. Louis broke all previous records as
a pig lead market during the past year.
The receipts were 2,2M),54S pigs, as com
pared with 1,946,139 during 18&J, while there
is not a year in the whole history of the
business that can compare with ISSfi, eith
er in point of the output in the St. Louis
district or the general increase in the
amount of business done. ,
"It has been the most prosperous year
in the history of lead mining in the coun
try, and Missouri has played a promi
nent part in the immense development. As
a general rule lead is struck at a depth
of 200 to 250 feet below the surface, out
during the past year discoveries of the
richest ore ever found have been made
Just under the sod and down as deep as
1100 feet. Perhaps the richest prospect
known in this country was struck the last
week of the year near Webb City, when
a 30-foot face vein of ore was uncovered,
the dirt from which yields 1600 pounds of
lead and zinc ores to the ton.
"Besides the immerse investments of
the National Lead Company it is known
that upward- of $400,000 was brought into
the State from outside investors to be
expended in lead mining over and above
the vast sums that were already invested.
Thousands of dollars weekly have been
earned by miners and mine owners, and
the industry has grown to be one of the
greatest in the State, besides forcing
Missouri to the front rank as a producer
of one of the most important commercial
metals."
An important grubstake decision has
been rendered by Federal Judge Han
ford at Scuttle. Seven Spokane men
grubstaked h prospector a year or two
ago to prospect in British Columbia. Af
ter a period of failure there he heard ot
the Klondike, went there and secured
come rich claims, in which the Spokane
men have sought to establish an Inter
est. It was shown that there were no
definite limitations of time and place In
the grubstake contract, and the court
holds:
"I consider that the contract cannot be
fairly construed so as to create any right
In favor of the plaintiffs to property sit
uated in a distant foreign country," pur
chased by Malloy with his own money
more than two years after the agreement
wa.s entered into. Grubstake contracts
will be enforced by the courts, but only
as other contracts. It is not enough for
parties to assert that' they have rights
In order to secure legal protection, but
they must be able to prove in each case
a clear and definite contract, and by
terms and conditions in compliance
therewith rights have become vested."
The warning Is that there should be a
definite agreement as to time, etc., when
grubstaking is done.
The 8,000.000 gallon reservoir for the
Argonaut mine, Amador County is com
pleted.
The Klnyon mine at Randsburg Is to
have a stampmillâ the first in that dis
trict.
On Ash Creek, near Hornbrook, Siski
you County, pockets of gold have been
taken out that aggregate in the neighbor
hood of $10,000 within the laat two
months.
it is reported that the King Solomon
mine at Johannesburg .Is turning out $1000
ore at a depth of. 315 feet, and from the
"William 'J. Bryan mine a strike is re
ported of still richer ore. From the Nancy
Hanks (of the Rand) fifty tons will be
sent to the reduction works as an experi
ment.
At the Montaiik, El Dorado County
work progresses satisfactorily to the new
purchasers, who seem elated over their
acquisition. They are considering the im
mediate addition of twenty stamps.
A contract for sinking the South Eure
ka shaft at Jackson 200 feet deeper has
been let to Crocker &' Wells, of Jackson
the price per foot being $14 95. - The pres
ent depth of the shaft is 1300 feet.
The mines at Harrison Gulch Shasta
County, are being worked with full crews
both night and day. The cyanide plant
is also run full time.
Considerable development work has re
cently been done on the Galena, quartz
mine at Black Canyon. The main tun
nel has been extended on the ledge 410
feet. The ledge has an average width of
four feet. Development work is being
done on the -.orsefly quartz mine, which
is an extension of the Galena quartz
mine in Black Canyon. The prospect
tunnel is now in seventy feet on the ledge
and some fine-looking quartz has been
taken â Auburn Argus.
The Reward mine. Nevada City, la one
of the properties in which successful de
velopment has been going on In Nevada
County. A drain tunnel 1700 feet long
taps the shaft at 480 feet. The shaft is
down 6SO feet. A two-stamp mill has
been erected. On the 600-foot level ore
running $160 a ton was found. Of the
present status of , the mine the Nevada
City Herald says: "The Reward â  mine,
this district, is looking first rate now, and
will doubtless be . a dividend-payer from
this on. Considerable ground has been
opened, and the ledge is being stoped on
the 500 and 600 levels. * The ledges in the
Reward, while small, are high grade, and
much of the ore is sacked and sent- to
Selby's. The mine has been skillfully
managed, and : while the miners ; are / ex
tracting what we should call $25 rock now,
there are large ore reserves which ; are
even richer.
"Superintendent Gribble has worked
iiard for nearly three years to get, the
mine In its (present shape, and he is en

WHIST
WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE
FOR WHIST.
The President of the Pacific Coast Whist As
sociation, at the fourth annual meeting that
has Jupt passed Into history, gave for the first
time to those in attendance a little Inkling of
a few things that California has done for the
good of the cause.
After calling: attention to the fact that the
association had passed the experimental stage
and was now a living realityâ a fixed fact, to
use his own wordsâ he says:
"We all know the purpose for which our
association was formed. 1. c.. to promote anrnre
general feeling of good fellowship and Interest
In the great Intellectual paÃtime we all love
so well. I can say. without fear of contradic
tion, that the good work of this little associa
tion of ours has been felt, not only on the en
tire Pacific Coast, but in every State of the
Union, and even found its way not only across
the Pacific, but across the Atlantic, to the
crib where whist was born, vouchers; by the
score tor such a broad statement I have pre
sented you. time and again, from the great
whist masters of the old world, Including Sir
William Pole, General A. W. Drayson, Henry
Jones ("Cavendish' 1 ). W. H. Whitneld, Sir
Charles Russell and others.
"I am proud to say that California has more
than held its own In the front rank of the
great national whist procession. I will now,
for the first time, give you a little bit of un
written whist history In connection with our
association, as well as to tell you a little that
California has done for the good of. the cause
In general.
"When the little handful of whist enthusiasts
from a few sections of the country made a
pilgrimage to Milwaukee, in the spring of ISM.
and laid the corner stone, or founded what bo
many o*Â° us are proud to call the American
Whist Leairue, little did we dream that It
would spread as It har, like a great prairie
fire, until it swept the entire country from
ocean to ocean, and from the Gulf of Mexico
to British America.
"This league has grown to wonderful pro
portions, and each year this national Institu
tion, with Its now thousands of members,
meets at annual congresses, and whist clubs
and whist players 'fall In' and answer roll
call from every State In the Union."
WHIST ASSOCIATIONS.
California, although 2000 miles away from the
main body, saw one impending dangerâ a rock
on which this gTeat leviathan might strike and
be dismembered. This noble ship could spure
none of its rigging, nor could it Jettlsonize an/
portion of Its cargo: It must be held Intact, but
some that wanted to get aboard could not. as
the distance was â  too great .to Jump; some
thing was demanded, and In order to provide
for the emergency. 'It was suggested by a
member of â¢ this association, at - the â  fourth an
nual congress, held In Philadelphia, that the
time was fast approaching when it was certr-'n
that minor leagues would spring up an 1 take
root In different parts of the, country, anc Â»ap
the main body unless provisions were made to
receive them under the one banner, 1 Into- the
one fold; the great national organization would
surely totter, and possibly fall. This occurred
in May, ISS*4. â ;â -.- â -><hqgfcW*%agsÂ«yig^B3iaai
It was at this time that the Idea of this asso
ciation first saw the light of day: lew were
aware of Its existence. It remained In its
swaddling clothes until i December, t lbiÂ»4, when
Its projectors handed It. over to you and asked
you to father it and give it a name. This was
the first born, : and the beginning of whist as
sociations in America. . . â ' , â  â  . -
â  When this question â â  of lntersectional whist
leaguesâ as the Idea was, first calledâ was pre
sented to . the , president .. and ' executive ' com
mittee of the American Whist League. * the
emergency was not looked upon as coming In
the near future. If at all; it was not seriously
thought of. but inside of . six months | necessity
demanded their formation," and to-day there are
no less' than : fifteen associations that have fol
lowed In our wake, i each and every one of â 
them, like ours, formed under â¢ the wing and
protection of that noble Institution that stands
to-dn.-y; as firm as the rock, of Gibraltar â the:

this association. It wai California that sug
gested the idea of introducing whist as a study
into our universities for mental training, and
which has already been accomplished in some
of the private schools of the country.
THE WOMAN'S WHIST LEAGUE
It was one of your delegates from California
that was first to suggest the Innovation of a
Woman's Whist League.
This idea was brought to the attention of
Miss Kate Wheelock, known the world over
as the "Whist Queen," in December, 1895. and
January, 1596, in St- Louis, at the. midwinter
meeting of . the executive committee of the
American Whist League, It was first brought
by that same delegate to the notice of several
directors of the league for their opinion, in
dorsement and approval. They at that time
thought it was too radical a move, and much
to the ulsapointment of the one who heartily
believed In the success of the movement, he
was urged- to advise Miss Wheelock to abandon
the project, which he reluctantly consented to.
Like other things that California has sug
gested, it wouldn't down, and in little over a
year from that date, the Woman's Whist
League went down the ways, was safely
launched, with Mrs. E. H. Andrews of Phila
delphia at her bow, and those name gentlemen
who thought the move too radical. In -a -few
months became Its ardent supporters. This
league Is now getting under full sail, anJ if
carefully guided will get safely through the
breakers; then It will do honor and credit to
the one who has had the courage to renew the
effort* to establish it. and has since been chosen
as Its first president. . '
It was California that first Instituted whist
matches between men and women..
It was from a club belonging to this asso
ciation that a lady was selected who was the
first to enter any major, trophy contest held
In this country. up to that time, and by her
brilliant play contributed no small degree to
ward winning the trophy that stands first to
day In our association. â .
I am proud to say that . the women whist
players of California are Just as strong as the
11161) * ' â  * " "
California has tried to make whist the at
traction or magnet for the homes and fireside
where father and mother, sons and daughters
can enjoy this beautiful. Intellectual accom
plishment, where I hope it will never be play^
for anything more than the love we â  have
for It. â 
NO NAME WHIST CLUB.
The members of the No Nome Whist Club
were charmingly entertained Thursday even-
Ing, the 27th Inst., at the home of Miss Lillian
rmbach 3965 Twenty-fourth street. The first

I COMPANIONS OF THE FOREST. F.O. A.
Last Tuesday night the officers of Lore
ley Circle. Companions of the Forest, F.
i O. A., were publicly installed in the Al
j cazar by Deputy Mrs. Hejena Worms, as
sisted by Mrs. Schumacher as marshal.
The ceremony of installation was con
ducted in the German, for this circle
works in that language, and the work
was very well done. The following are
the officers for the ensuing term: Mrs. B.
Pope, C. C. ; Mrs*. Marie Pape, S. C. C. ;
Mra. H. Schuck, T.; Mrs. A.

HALE BROS.
were entertained with a short programme,
after which dancing followed.
The officers of Silver Star Circle of San
Rafael w<-re installed last week by Mrs
Harrington, G. C, Â«'., assisted by Samuel
Label, and after the ceremony was over
there was a short programme or enter
tainment and ,i collation.
The entertainment, in the nature of a
basket social, given last week by Inter
No* Circle In the Alcazar Social Hall |
was a Kreat success, as there was a large
attendance, and the social feature was all ;
that could be desired. A number of bas
kets, filled with good things, were do
nated by the lady members, and these
were auctioned off, the purchaser hav
ing for the balance of the evening the
companionship of the contributor. The j
sharpest contest was for a basket con- .
tributed by the "Three Graces" of the
circle, and nt the close of the competition |
it went to the three handsomest men in
the hall, they having pooled to purchase
it. Between dances there were enter
taining numbers.
Grand Chief Companion Mrs. Emma
Harrington on last Tuesday commenced
a tour of official visitations. That night .
she visited Mlzpah Circle at the Potrero |
Opera-house and witnessed the work i
rendered by th" members in a creditable
manner. On Thursday night she visited
Loreley Circle, and was accompanied by !
Grand Pub ("htef Companion Coburn.
Grand Trustee Mrs. Jacobs, District
Deputy Mrs. H. Worms, Chief Ranger !

Mrs. Mari- pp apea pc and J. G. Chase Jr., ad
dressed the meeting.
Last Tuesday night Grand Chief Com
panion Mrs. Harrington and the members
of the Executive Council paid an official
visit to Golden Gate Circle and were giv
en an exemplification of the work of in
itiation, but as it was not done with that |
perfeetness that is expected of officers \
there were som^ severe comments. The j
suggestions for improvement were taken
in the spirit in which they were Intended
and the officers promised to profit by
the advice given.
On Wednesday the same officers paid a
visit to Live Oak Circle and they were ,
well received, but for want of a candi- ]
date the work was not exemplified, so i
the visiting officers had no means of ,
knowing how well the team of this circle 1
can do the work. There were present a
large number of visitors, who were enter
tained wtth many good suggestions of- j
fered under the head of good and wel
fare.
On Thursday night the members of Bo- ;
nlta Circle were honored by a visit from j
the grand officers, who were well re- j
ceived and were well entertained by the
members of the sitting circle.

uary by a delegation of seventy-five from
Healdsburg Lodge and during the even
ing the visitors conferred the degrees on
candidates for the sitting lodge in a man
ner that won for them the admiration of
all, and must have made the Healdsburg
contingent feel proud that it has such a
proficient team. After the degree work,
the visitors and others, together with tno
membership of Harbor Lodge, numbering
in all about 250. enjoyed a sumptuous
banquet. On Sunday the visitors as the

day greetings to Mrs. M. E. Donoho. sec
retary of the State Assembly, given by

has ever been arranged by this lodge of
the Rebekahs, which is noted for the
many young and beautiful and also wide
awake and progressive ladies of its mem
bership. The hall was crowded to its
s ;tting capacity and was most tastefully
decorated with evergreens and plants, on
which were many paper butterflies of
every shade, while on the walls there
were hundreds of imitation lepidopterous
insects, and each one present wore one

HALE BROS.
HILDA JOHNSON'S
TRAGIC DEATH
Conflicting Testimony as
to the Speed of the
Car.
The Child Ran Upon the Track
to See a Dog Drawing
a Cart.
Verdict That the Accident Could Not
.Have Happened Had There
Been Proper Fenders.
"And we further find that the acci
dent could have been averted had the
car been equipped with proper fen
ders, and we exonerate the motorman
from all blame."
Such was the material part of the
verdict of the Coroner's Jury yesterday
in the case of little Hulda Johnson, who
was killed last Sunday by being run
over by an electric car on Mission
street, between Fifth and Sixth.
Mrs. McLaughlin of 720 Twenty-sec
ond street was on the car at the time.
She told the jury that the car was go
ing at a high rate of speed just before
the child was struck. She was sure
that the bell was not rung.
Mrs. Fitzgerald was sitting at her
window at 952 Mission street and saw
the baby toddling from its parents'
house toward the track. The child got
on the track. Then she saw the car
coming along at a rapid gait and try
to slacken up, but it was too late and
the child was knocked under the
wheels.
"He had plenty of time to stop the
car," she added, "for he could surely
have seen the child, and there were no
carriages or other vehicles in the
neighborhood."
Mrs. Julia F. Knott was sitting at
her parlor window at 945 Mission street
when the child toddled on the track
and was "squashed" under the car.
After striking the child .the car could
not have gone more than two or three
feet before it stopped.
Mrs. J. Hall of 944 Mission street
said that the car stopped just after the
