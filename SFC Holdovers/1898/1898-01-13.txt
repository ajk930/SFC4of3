FORT SMITH, Ark., Jan. 12.â Nearly
two score of human lives and upward
of one million dollar?' worth of prop
erty were destroyed by a terrible tor
nado which burst upon this city a few
minutes past 11 o'clock last night. The
Btorm struck near the National Cem
etery and tore its way through the en
tire city, leaving its path marked by
death and desolation. Men, women
and children, peacefully asleep in their
homes, were, without a moment's warn
ing, awakened to meet a horrible death
In the fearful storm, while oth<-rs, mo
mentarily more fortunate, and who es
caped thf furies of the wind, met a far
worse fate a few moments later in the
flames which soon engulfed many of the
wrecked buildings.
The scene following the first terrible
crash of the storm was one of awful
grandeur.
Business blocks, handsome mansions,
hotels and humble cottages were razed
to the ground and scattered in shape
less masses. Several of the wrecks
caught fire and the Inflammable timbers
burned furiously.
The city was crowded with rural vis
itors, many of whom were sleeping at
boarding houses unregistered. For this
reason the number of victims who per
ished may never be definitely known.
The storm struck the city near the
National Cemetery and swept its way
through the heart of the town. Leav
ing Fort Smith, It bounded by Van
Buren and continued down the river,
demolishing everything in Its path.
News from outside points Is not yet at
hand, but rumors of murh^damage as
far south as Alma have reached here.
It being reported that a number of per
sons were killed near that place.
In Fort Smith the tornado struck
Garrison avenue at the corner of
Ninth street and made a clean sweep
from there to the Texas corner. Nine
store buildings were demolished and
the stocks of goods ruined. Sixteen
other business houses on the street
were badly wrecked.
The upper floor of the block on the
corner of Garrison and Towsou ave
nues is used as a flat. The ruins
caught fire from the night lamp. Seven
bodies were taken from these ruins,
two of them being so badly burned
that they could scarcely be Identified.
Burgess Hotel, a three-story brick on
Towsou avenue, was demolished.
There have been eight bodies already
taken from the ruins. Rescue parties
are still at work at both places and ex
pect to find several more bodies.

A half pane of glass was driven
through Carter's body, almost severing
his head from the trunk.
The beautiful National Cemetery is
a wreck. The huge tree's are uprooted,
the lodge demolished and the walls torn
down.
Fort Smiths $50,000 high school build
ing, the finest one of its kind in the
Southwest, was badly wrecked, but was
one of the few buildings on which there
was any tornado insurance.
The tornado destroyed two historic
buildings. Judge Parker's residence is
badly wrecked and the old rector's
mansion, where Allen Pike passed his
days, is a pile of ashes, the ruins hav
ing caught fire from a lamp.
The First Baptist Church and the
Central Methodist Church were razed
to the ground and are now only a scat

of the Immaculate Conception and
Brownscombe Memorial Church lost
their spires and sustained other dam
age.
lt is now thought that all the per

have been accounted for.
The citizens' relief committee has
$10,000 in hand for assisting sufferers.
President Kohlnson of the Frisco rail

and Thurston to

DAVIS 1 SPEECH CONCLUDED
The Senate Will Make Up Its Mind
Slowly on the Great
Question.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â A
Washington special to the Com
mercial Advertiser says: Lines
are being drawn tightly In the
struggle over the Hawaiian
treaty. The opponents of ratifi
cation have made a canvass
which shows thirty-two votes
against 'the treaty, and a can
vass of the friends of annexation
shows fifty-seven votes for it.
From this it appears that the
treaty is beaten unless further
accessions can be made from the
Democratic side. Senators Gear
of lowa and Thurston of Nebras
ka have broken away from their
Republican associates and have
announced their intention to
vote against ratification. Sen
ator Spooner of Wisconsin is
wavering and is not unlikely to
join Thurston and Gear.
The influence of the beet sugar
guard, which has been felt ever
since the question of Hawaiian
annexation came to the front in
1892. is being 1 exerted strongly to
bring other Western Senators to
vote against ratification, and
Mr. Oxnard, representative of
the Nebraska sugar industry, is
at the Capitol daily.
With this exception little out
side Influence is apparently be
ing exerted on either side. Ac
cording to the present pro
gramme It will be some time be
fore a vote can be reached. The
policy of both sides for the pres
ent will be one of d>!ay, and
there will be no pressure for
speedy action unless one side or
the other shall become convinced
that a roll call will disclose a
sure supremacy.
Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington. Jan. 12.
There la no doubt that the annexa
tionlsts are greatly concerned about
the treaty. As matters stand to-night
it is defeated. The annexatlonlsts
lack four or five, probably six, votes.
George Hazelton, who is here in the
interest of annexation, appoars to be
discouraged. President McKinley Is
warming up to the situation in the
Senate regarding the treaty. He never
tries to use what is known as "In
fluence" in working on a Congressman,
but has the honest habit of talking
straight and arguing with â  man as ;i
man. the person presenting the must
satisfactory reasons to be the winner.
The statement that Senators Thurs
ton and Gear had broken away from
the list of Republicans supporting the
treaty was of Interest to the President,
and when these two Senators called at
the White House to-day to talk patron
age the President found opportunity
to talk over the Hawaiian situation
with them. Probably little was saJd
to Senator Gear, because he was ac
companied by General Henderson,
whose illness has prevented his calling
at the White House for months.
The President and Senator Thurston,
however, had a long chat on the sub
ject. It can be stated with posltlve
ness that Senator Thurston is unde
cided what he will do. The President
thinks a great deal of Senator Thurs
ton and would be pleased to see the
Nebraskan added to the list of Repub
licans supporting annexation.
What has brought Senators Gear and
Thurston to the point of opposing an
nexation Is that the sugar industry of
the islands Is crippling, or threatens to
cripple, the same industry in Nebraska
and lowa. This Industry has become
a lusty one In Nebraska, and the con
cern of Senator Thurston is local.
It Is understood that Senator E'klns,
a hearty supporter of annexation, was
with the President when Senator
Thurston walked in. The West Vir
ginia Senator has been working hard
with his Nebraska friend to bring
about a change In his views, and when
they met in the presence of the Presi
dent to-day the arguments were re
newed. The President took part with
the energy known to him 'when he Is
deeply interested in a subject, and he
and Senator Thurston discussed the
subject some time after Senator El
kins left. The administration is be
ginning to view the growing power of
Japan with keen interest, and the
President thinks the acquisition of
Hawaii ought not to be delayed. He is
confident that with the islands becom
ing a part of this country, a cable to
Hawaii and one to Japan would be one
of the certain results. This cable line
would give this country Instant com
munication with. Its fleet In Asiatic, wa
ters, and would put the United States
on a stronger basis than It now en-
Joys. It would also, he thinks, do won
ders In increasing the trade of the
United States with the East. The Pres
ident must have had some strong ar
gument "up his sleeve" when he en
countered the Nebraska Senator, be
cause It left the Senator in an unde
cided frame of mind, when shortly be
fore he was npninst annexation. The
President is familiar enough with the
subject to argue fluently with anybody,
and he knows Senator Thurston is one
of the men who must be convinced by
argument before changing his position.
Senator Davis continued and com
pleted his speech in the executive
session of the Senate to-day on the
Hawaiian question, and was followed
by Senator Allen of Nebraska, who
spoke in opposition.
Mr. Davis requested in the begin
ning that no questions should be asked
during the presentation of his argu
ment, as he preferred, he Paid, not to
have the continuity of his thoughts
broken. The speech to-day was devot
ed largely to a presentation of the stra
tegic features of annexation. He dis
played a chart in front of the presid
ing officer's platform, showing the lo
cation of Hawaii relative to this coun
try and to Asm. One of the points
brought out with considerable elabor
ation was the probable effect on the
Nicaragua Canal of the occupation of
the islands by BOine foreign power. He
illustrated by a reference to the map
showing that Hawaii was In a straight
j line between the western terminus of
the canal and Japan and China. The
nation, he said, which controls Hawaii
will control that great gateway of com
merce, as the guns planted on Hawaii
! would be pointed directly at the mouth
| of the canal.
He devoted careful attention to the
importance of controlling Pearl Har
bor, now owned by the United States,
saying that the nation which maintain
ed possession of this harbor would hold
the key to the military situation in the
North Pacific He read extracts from
reports by engineers and others in con
firmation of this statement and in sup
port of a statement which he made as
to the character of the harbor, which
was that it was safe and commodious
and could be easily defended. He also
nted the necessity for controlling
Hawaii as a base of supplies in case
<>f hostilities, saying that it was almost
necessary to control It for this reason
on account of the impossibility of a
warship crossing the Pacific \rithou*
replenishing h"r coal supply.
Mr. Davis ridiculed the objection
made by Japan thnt the addition of
Hawaii as United S:ates territory would
he a violation of Japan's treaty rights
in the island. I! said, in reply to this
objection, that all rights would doubt
less be protected, and instanced the
m ;ttion of th>> German empire as
showing the effect of annexation upon
the treaties of various countries which
erter tnto a urns-il.
He referred to JafÂ«n's protest as an
indication of a natural tendency to ra
pacity, and said that the Government
of that country should have been satis
fied with the territory wrested from
' China instead of wanting to gorge her
self by the addition of Hawaii.
Mr. Davis called attention to the ap
parently cordial relations existing be
tween China and Japan, as manifested
by Japan's offer to lend her fleet to the
English in their operations In Chinese
waters, where he said the greatest
naval demonstration of history was
about to be made. He did not Indicate
a belief that immediate war would be
the result of European competition over
Chinese territory. On th>- contrary, he
called attention to the fact that the
flaps of Great Britain, France. Ger
many and Russln. were floating side by
sld^ in the Orl.-ntal waters, neither
power being apparently anxious to
disturb the other so long as there was
a prospect of each powt-r setting as
much as the others were taking. The
OBljf way in which the United States
could protect itself against this
division of territory would be to con
trol the Hawaiian Islands. In case we
should fail to do this there was danger
of losing very important trade advan-

How San Quentin Prices
Yield the Pool BiÂ£

Illegal High Price Inflation of the
Jute Mill Revolving Fund.
State Senator Ostrom's
Caustic Comment.
WHEATLAND, Jan. 12.â Your correspondent called on Hon. D. A.
Ostrom at his residence near Colmena Colony to-day and directed
his attention to The Call's exposure of jobbery in prison grain bags.
After reading the article Ostrom expressed himself as well pleased
that The Call had taken this matter up. Said he:
"The suppression of the manipulation of the grain bags by the
bag ring has been the fight of my life. The passage of the act which
now bears my name was the result of months of labor, and at Its
passage I felt assured that the grain bag ring had been forced out of
their Illegitimate business, and the farmer would be able to purchase
his sacks at reasonable prices. But my hopes have been shattered.
"In some way the provisions of the law are evaded and the traffic
In sacks is again manipulated. I am heartily glad The Call has taken
up this matter, and I hope it probes it to the very bottom. In this ar
ticle I recognize the fact that The Call understands well the subject,
and so far as it deals with the history of the bill, the marketing of the
prison sacks, and the market, it is apparently correct In detail.
"How is the law avoided by the Prison Directors? Now, that ques
tion I cannot answer for publication, as I have no proof that the di
rectors engage In illegal transactions; but it is my private opinion
that some of the directors have very capacious rear pockets.
"No, I do not think Warden Hale is entirely to blame, though he
shows very poor judgment in his indorsement of the sales of the
prison bags.
"No, I have no knowledge of the direct violation of the law by
farmers or merchants, though I infer from the reports of the jute mill,
and the reports published in the newspapers, that it is of frequent oc
currence; and I believe The Call will have no difficulty in securing
evidence to sustain its charges."
Before entering upon an exposure In j
detail of the manner in which San |
Quentin Jute bags are hawked about j
the State by middlemen, it will be ;
demonstrated by The Call that the |
Board of State Prison Directors are di- j
rectly to blame, not only for the per
ntctoua system of sales they have fos
tered, but for a persistently aggressive
policy against the thousands of small ;
farmers they should have exercised
every vigilance and stretch of author
tty to protect.
The single and conspicuous merit of
the Ostrom law of 1893 lies in its plain
ly pronounced intent to favor the j
PRICE FIVE CESTTS.
smaller and struggling wheat raisers
with grain sacks approximately at
cost. It assumes, as is the well under
stood reason of existence of the San
Quentin jute mill, that the State is not
engaged in a profit making industry to
which farmers shall contribute from
their oft-times precarious earnings. It
should have been clearly comprehend
ed by the board that under the Ostrom
and preceding jute mill acts thejr duty
was not to scheme, as might the board
of managers of a private industrial
trust, to derive a profit from the legiti
mate purchasers of the product.
One fact is obvious, and the recital2
of it renders nugatory any excuse the
board may offer for a policy of mis-
management intended to defvat the
vise and beneficent purpose which in
spired the establishment of the jutÂ»>
mill. It would be impossible for them
to garner surplus revenue from the
product, without taking it out of the
pockets of the farmers. Not only is
this true, but every increase of prict
fixed by them above actual cost, beside?
being of the nature of extortion, is an
Inflated standard of value for sacks to
which the price for the Calcutta im
portations are adjusted. It is a fic
titious margin within which the im
porters may juggle their rates.
The hardship thus imposed on the
farmers is a double one. Under the
specious pretext of making money for
the prison fund, thoso farmers who
use State sacks are forcrd to pay more
money for their supplies than they
should be required to pay, and all the
other farmers suffer losses consequent
upon an inflation of price which the
price of Calcutta sacks is made to ap
proximate in the market.
In this manner the competitive value
of the San Quentin plant is nullified if
not destroyed.
A careful review of the subjoined fig
ures will emphasize the point. The orig
inal revolving fund of $40,000 was in
creased to enlarge the scope of opera
tions for the dire.-tors in 1594 to $100,000.
The revolving fund, be it understood,
was devised as a sort of rotary capi
talization of the raw jute needed for
manufacture. From this fund money is
drawn to pay for jute purchases and
in turn the fund receives the proceeds
from the sales of the manufactured
goods.
A strict and legal administration of
affairs would keep the fund within
the legal limitation: that is to say, at
no time should the cash on hand and
investments in raw jute and manufac
tured goods exceed $100,000. In other
words, when the fund, as thus repre
sented by the three items of value, ex
ceeds $100,000. it should be the duty of
the board to reduce the price of the
goods below errst, until the equilibrium
of the fund was re-established.
On the other hand, when the assets
and cash show a depletion of the fund,
they are enabled, under the legal privi
lege of adjusting prices within one cent
a sack in excess of the cost of produc
tion to reimburse the revolving capital
to its limit. It follows that at no time
should the hoard m.-mage the sales and
fix prices so as to create designedly a
dividend on the $100,000, since such divi
dend can be derived only from a class
of citizens with whom the State is not
dealing on principles of barter.
Beginning with the fiscal yenr,
1593-94, an examination of the records
will disclose the surprising fact that
the capitalization of the San Quentin
Btock and product has been progres
sive and enormously so. The fund
was then represented by raw jute,
$14. ."Â«4 64; manufactured goods, $32.
640 51; rash. S10'\000 : total, $147,225 15.
In the suceeding year it was swollen
by $25.916 41. as follows: Raw jute,
$53,058 02; manufactured goods, $122.
957 22; cash, $96 32; total. $176,141 sfi.
At the opening of the ISP6-97 term
year it stood: Raw jute. $53,214 ss;
minufactured goods. $141, 525 54; cash,
?5^2 38; total, $200,572~45.
But this was not enough, BO in 1^97.
when the farmers were promised n
prosperous year, the board developed
Its masterful stroke of mismanagement
by forcing another dividend of $50,000.
On January 1, 1897, it is found that the
score stands: Raw jute, $19,150 82:
manufactured goods, $131. 157 57; cash,
$100,600, or a total represented by the
revolving fund of $250,308 39.
So that in three and a half years the
directors have juggled over $150,000
out of the farmers, not to mention the
immeasurable losses they caused the
farming industry by reason of the co
operation they have so glaringly ex
tended, by the maintenance of exces
sive prices for sacks, to the combina
tion of Calcutta importers and the
middlemen. Business expediency can
rot justify such a willful perversion
of the law.
In following the systematic manipu
lations of th<^ board to a logical and
inevitable end, in a few decades they
would have squeezed the farmers out
of enough money to run a life and fire
insurance auxiliary to the other State
institutions. On the basis of the profits
of the three years pas?t they would
have shaved from the farmers' crops
the handsome sum of half a million,
and in a single generation their ex
tortions would be represented by fig
ures little less than $3,000,000.
Who shall dare to say that the San
Qucntin jutemill was founded and its
revolving fund created for such a
purpose?
Taking up thÂ« operations of the
board for 1K97, it may be affirmed at
the outset that they could not have
failed to perceive the hardships they
were inflicting on the farming indus- \
try by the extraordinary course they 1
pursued. Section 2 of the Ostrom law i
distinctly says: "Demands for jute j
goods by consumers shall be promptly j
filled." If this means anything it is ;
that immediately upon receipt of the i
application or order, accompanied by .
the required 10 per cent deposit, the '
goods shall be shipped. As further j
specified in the same section, the re- i
maining 90 per cent of the purchase !
money shall be paid on receipt of the
consignment by the farmer or actual
consumer.
As section 2 says orders shall be
promptly filled, it cannot mean that
â¦they shall be accepted as contracts for
the delivery of sacks at some indefinite
time to be subsequently named by th.?
applicant. This clause simply gives
plain expression to the manifest pur
pose of the whole act: namely, that the
sacks shall go to actual consumers, and
that they shall be sold for prompt de
livery when needed.
Now, what did the board do? Did
they go to the trouble to advise farm
ers throughout the State of an Inten
tion to dispose of the 3,000,000 and more
sacks on hand in lots for future de
livery? Did they give timely warning
that sacks were to be sold to any and
all affidavit applicants, and that a sin
gle applicant might secure the option
on a million sacks if he would swear he
intended to consume them? Did they
serve notice that unless the thousands
of small and needy farmers got in their
application during the early part of the
month of February, when the number
of sacks to be used by wheat-raisers
was problematical at the best, the price
would be raised by the arbitrary action
of the board, so that when the sacks
were actually required for the crop, the
cnpt to the small farmer would be 65
cents more per hundred? Did they in
any manner, by impartial correspond
ence or action, indicate either the de
sire or purpose to obey the law of 1593,
In letter or spirit?

How did it come that the action of
the board early in February was in
spired by the filing with them of a
relatively few applications for grain
parks in numbers ranging from 20,000
to 100,000? Had their design been deter
mined on quietly in advance and in
formation about it a? quietly imparted
to the persons to ha favored? It would
seem so. Calcutta, sneks were â  drug
at $4 ">, and $4 87%, June and July de
livery, when the board resolved to sell
sacks in any amount within a single
application for a million: the order to
be filled whenever it suited the appli
cant. In short order, or to put it more
specifically within fifteen days, 2.000,
000 sacks were contracted for
sale at $4 75. These sacks, ware
housed at San Quentin, remained
undisturbed until summer, when the
market pot active. If this swift trans
action, by which the revolving fund
would have been abundantly reim
bursed, wa3 of the slightest benefit to
the small farmer, it could not helj)
him further to increase the price on
the sacks already sold and on the rap
ply remaining to be disposed of. Yet
the board, after having thus reduced
its store by 2.000.000 sacks, raised the
price to $5 per hundred, and sold an
other million and a quarter, also for
future delivery.
Then the situation, BO far as the
board had any pretext for wnrriment
over the surplus product, was modi
fied. They were entitled to feel con
tent with themselves, and in a beatific
state of mind, so far as was con
cerned any fear lest they be burdened
with surplusage. Did they then re
adjust the price of sacks approximately
to the cost of the output, and give
thÂ° small farmers a chance to get in
at the eleventh hour on the ground
floor? Not at all. On the contrary,
after the surplus was exhausted, or af
ter it had been pledged for delivery,
they once more jolted the price up, this
time to $5 40 a hundred. A little fig
uring at this point will be entertaining
as well as enlightening 1 . The 10 per
cent deposit required on the 2.000,000
applications amounted to $9500, and on
the 1.250.000, $72.^0. making the total con
tract deposit $16,750. For this sum
of money the board made a warehouse
transfer of the grain -ba^r surplus of
the San Quentfn mills. Before final
payment was made on the purchases,
and six weeks after the plan was in
cepted, at a time when the board had
nothing but future product to calcu
late on, they overstepped the law to
swell the price to consumers to $5 40
per hundred sacks.
To the intending purchasers the
warehouse sto^k was thus made to rep
resent the following watered pro-fit.
On 2,000,000 sacks the price was ad
vanced by the resolution of March 13
65 cents per hundred, or $13,000. The
1,250,000 sacks sold after the resolution
of February 20, fixing the price at $5
per hundred, were made by the March
resolution referred to, more valuable
by 40 cents per 100, or a total of $5000.
It will be noted that the total of the
increased appraisement thus artificially
i contrived was SIS, OOO. Now mark the
comparison! Only $16,. r >oo was paid
! for this aggregate bargain, so that the
i watered profit on the future delivery
j sacks was made to cover the 10 per
1 cent deposit guaranteeing delivery, and
| leave a margin of $1500. That is to s>y.
the prices advanced by th^ board were
! advanced on stock . still in the State
warehouse, and the total increase of
| value represented by this advance more
! than reimbursed the applicants the 10
per cent paid the State to initiate the
purchases.
On what ground this proceeding can
be commended it would take a special
â¢ ist in specious pleading to suggest.
: The reports from the mill show that
I the actual cost of production at the
| time the 5.40 rate was fixed was in
; reality 4.24. It is specifically provided
iby law that the board shall at no
! time fix a rate in excess of l cent a.
! sack above the cost of production.
1 Therefore, here is a plain violation of
law, unwarranted by any emergency
or excuse of ignorance. When the
board had no more surplus sacks to
sell and were dealing merely with the
simple problem of the present output,
they not only went to the full legal
limit in readjusting the price, but be
yond it.
In summing up the evil effects of
â  the course pursued, the thousand and
' one small farmers in the last analysis
! were the sufferers, for to them the
' sacks handled in carload lots by mid-
I dlemen at $4 ?"â  and $5 per
; hundred were advanced to $5 40,
| with the local freight rate added,
while the inferior Calcutta sacks
â  were given approximately the same
rate. The tremendous swing the
middlemen enjoy in dealing with San
! Quentin sacks is indicated by the fact
j that Calcuttas and San Quentins are
I quoted side by side on the Produce
! Exchange.
A review of the quotations of last
year wtO demonstrate not only the
sympathetic movement in the prices of
the foreign and domestic products, but
a systematic one. In February, when
the prison board fixed their price at
$4 75, Calcuttas were quoted similarly.
February 20. when San Quentins were
raised to $5, Calcuttas registered the
same. March 20, the date of the $5 40
advance by the board, Calcuttas went
up to $5 25 for June and July delivery.
Here is an object lesson in price mani
pulation. Three days before the last
Calcutta advance, while the majority
of thÂ« farmers of the State were ignor
ant of what was going on, the following
information was given out on 'Change
and published in the commercial col
â¢umns of The Call:
"All the output of the San Quentin
prison, amounting to 3,300,000 grain
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JAXUARY 13, 1898.
bags, has been disposed of, and the di
rectors on that account have raised
the price for future deliveries to the
highest point allowed by law, namely,
$5 40 per hundred: and limited the
quantity to be sold to a single grower
of grain to 6000 bags."
Thirteen days later, or on March 30,
Caleutt.is stood at $5 75 spot and $5 75
June delivery. This boom in prices,
which could not have occurred as it
did were the San Quentin surplus
handled with rigorous adherence to the
provisions of the Ostrom law, fell most
severely on the small buyers, who
should have been enabled to purchase
for prompt delivery at bedrock prices
in June and July when the sacks were
coming into use.
The profit value added to the cost
price at San Quentin had to be paid
by the small farmers into the coffers
of the middlemen and what is known
as "The Big Five," constituting the
Calcutta pool. Between these impor
ters there is no competition as to
prices; in fact, they are so perfectly
organized for the purpose of maintain
ing prices that they have 'â¢flyers"
through the State who are employed
to check up the middlemen and hold
them as strictly as possible to the
pool quotation. Hence it comes that
these dealers so often offer their cus
tomers choice as between the Calcutta
and San Quentin sacks.

CUBAN INSURGENTS SAID
TO HAVE EXECUTED TWO
DEFENSELESS WOMEN.
Riotous Demonstrations in Havana. Led by
Many Officers of the Regular
Army.
Copyright, 189 S. by hBM Cordon Renn<>tt.
HAVANA, Jan. 12.â A horrible story
was brought in this morning by the
captain of a steamer from Gibara.
News has just been received that an
other Spanish officer has fallen victim
I to the ferocity of the insurgents while
i engaged in a peace mission. Major
' Puga, accompanied by a guide, visited
! yesterday morning the camp of Colo
nel Juan Delgado, near Rincon. Botk
were taken prisoners, and on the ma
jor frankly admitting that the purpose
of his visit was to propose acceptance
of autonomy preparation* were made
to hang them. While ropes were be
: ing adjusted Delgado found that the
soldiers of Villaviciosa regiment were
cloning in on him from all sides. He
then pave orders to shoot both pris
oners and retreated, escaping without
losses. The bodies of the officer and
his guide were recovered by the troops
and brought to Hincon.
The feeling of discontent that has
been smoldering in army circles for
several weeks broke into violence this
morning. As I write a crowd that has
already sacked two newspaper offices
is surging in Central Park, shouting
"Viva Espana." Peaceable citizens are
greatly frightened and the streets are
almost deserted. Everybody looks upon
the demonstration as against autonon
omy, but it is probably primarily
against the two newspapers, Reconeen
trado and La Dtscusion. both of which
have been denouncing General Weyler
and making charges of fraud against
army officers. The crowd included and
was led by more than sixty officers of
the Spanish army.
The demonstration commenced at 10
| o'clock this morning, when a large
I crowd, led by Spanish officers, went to
: the office of the Reconcentrado. near
the palace, forced nn entrance, tore up
proofs and wrecked some of the office
furniture. Senor Arnauto, the editor,
succeeded in escaping before the crowd
I arrived. A large force of police ar
! rived before much damage was done,
i and the crowd drew off without a col
lision with the police.
The crowd then marched up O'Reilly
i street to the office of L,a Discuslon,
; situated on the north side of Central
| Park.
This office it completely sacked, mal
treating one employe, the rest having
fled. Here the police seemed unable
to do any good.
Several Spanish gonrrals soon ar
rived on the npot from the Hotel In
glaterra, situated near by. They in
cluded General Parrado and his
staff. There was also present Gov
ernor Button, Chief of Police. Those
gentlemen are using their bost efforts
to pacify the crowd, which will prob
ably disperse before the police and
regulars are called out.
From La Discusion the crowd went
to Diarie de la Marina, but the man
agement had locked *Â»:d barricaded
the doors. There is great excitement
throughout the city, intensified by the
fact of the participation of Spanish
officers in the riot.
A VICTIM OF

Henry Savage Landor's
Awful Experience in
the Wilds of Asia.
One of His Eyes Is Burned
Out With Red-Hot
Irons.
He Loses Hia Reason and Almost His
Life, but Is Now Very Much
Better.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Jan. 13.â The Daily Chron
icle, in a description of the experiences
in Thibet of Henry Savage Landor, the
artist, writer and traveler, who nar
rowly escaped death at the hands of
the Thibetans when endeavoring last
autumn to reach Lhassa, the capital of
Thibet, says: "His valuable diary,
maps and other papers, including in
teresting photographs, were only inter
rupted when Mr. Landor himself was
under torture. One of these represents
the scene of the torture of a native
companion, tied naked to a tree and
clashed and bruised by a circle of hide
ous beings dancing around jeering at
and taunting their victim.
"Another photograph, taken after
the rescue, shows two unrecognizable
men. all the hair burned off their
heads, the skin lacerated and seamed
with burns, and in the eyes two ghast
ly slits. Mr. Landor lost one eye.
"The Thibetans repeatedly held
white-hot irons so close to the eyes
<>f their captives as, without touching
them, to shrivel and wither them.
This was practiced day after day. Mr.
Landor was rescued when nearly
dead. after being three days without
food and water, by a party Including
Mr. Wilson. Mr. Larkin and Karak
Sinprh Pal, nephew of the Rajawar of
Askote. who had heard from trading
Thibetans that a white man was
doomed to be beheaded in the interior
of Thibet.
"They started with the idea of pro
curing at least the mutilated bodies.
By forced marches and after thrilling
escapes from treacherous guides and
adventures nearly costing them their
lives, these three men reached the suf
ferers.
Mr. Landor hnd already lost his
reason. After three hours' attention
he regained sufficient consciousness to
say A\hcre he had concealed his cam
eras. They had a photograph taken of
the savaK'S cowering in terror of the
avenging whites. Mr. Landor was car
ried to Almora (in the Lumaon dis
trict of North India) by slow stages,
from which point he dispatched run
nt-rs with news for home. He kept the
diary, maps and surveys and has al
together 200 photographs and water
colors. His instruments he was
obliged to bury Jr the Himalayas. It
ie not probable Tlat Mr. Landor will
ever be well enoufch to return."
MORE MONEY
IS NECESSARY
Admiral Walker Writes
to the Secretary of
State.
Wants a Further Appropria-
tion for the Nicaragua
Canal Commission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House, !
Washington, Jan. 12.
Admiral "Walker, at the head of the
Nicaragua Canal Commission, has sent
to the Secretary of State the following
letter asking an additional appropria
tion for the work of his commission,
and it will be sent to Congress:
The Nicaragua Canal Commission, with
its staff, instruments and outfit, is now in
Nicaragua in condition for continuing the
surveys and examinations into the proper
route and the feasibility and cost of con
struction of the Nicaragua canal, with the
view of making complete plans for the
entire work of construction of such canal.
A large amount of money has been ex- j
pended in bringing to Nicaragua a staff
of about one hundred engineers and sur
veyors. A large additional force of na
tive laborers must be employed and the !
working parties must be maintained and
fed from the United States, as they can
not be supplied with promptness and cer
tainty from the resources of Nicaragua
in the wild parts of the country where
their work will be prosecuted.
Work of the nature upon which this
commission is engaged is in this country
carried on at great expense. The monthly
payroll will be large and the expense of
transportation and maintenance will be
heavy. Now that the commission is here
with its staff, instruments, outfit and
stores of all kinds, it would be most un
fortunate to be obliged to suspend the
work. and send the .white employes back
to the United States because of a- lack
of funds. A great Joss of money and a
long delay would result therefrom, and I
therefore recommend that an additional
appropriation of $100,000 for the use of this
commission be asked of Congress by
special bill, the money to be made im
mediately available so that there may be
no doubt of the work being carried
through continuously to the end, and that
the whole question of feasibility and cost
of construction of a canal by the Nicara
gua route may,' so far as possible, be
settled at once and forever.

local ship yard special inducements to
go to Seattle, where, he says, a big

tively say, that the Cramps are to
start the enterprise. He is offering
wages much higher than paid at any

TWO TEACHERS
AS WITNESSES
Progress of the School
Inquiry at L,os
Angeles.
Miss Blanford Tells of a Note
She Holds Against Chair
man Davis.
Miss Duncan's Warrant Shaved by
Director Brnly â Kubach Causes
a Great Surprise.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 12â Only two
witnesses of importance were examined
on behalf of the defense before the
Board of Education to-night. These
were Miss C. If. Blanford and Miss L.
A. Duncan. There were a number of
other witnesses, but they testified to
nothing new.
Miss Blanford, who Is a teacher in
the Amelia-street School, testified that
she holds Mr. Davis' note for $200, and
that the note came into her possession
on the Ist of July, 1897. The note was
for money loaned by her mother to Mr.
Davis in 1892. Her mother transferred
the note to witness on July 1, 1897.
Mr. Davis still had the money and was
paying interest. She did not consider
It a deposit but a loan to Davis. There
was no security, but she considered it
a safe investment. Her mother was
an old client of Mr. Davis. The note
Kiven the mother had become outlawed
and a new note was made in favor of
witness when the mother assigned the
indebtedness to witness.
Davis is the newly elected chairman
of the Board of Education, and was
elected as a member of the Board of
Education by the League for Better
City Government.
Miss L. A. Duncan, a school teacher,
testified that she had cashed her No
vember warrant at the Southern Cali
fornia Savings Bank, of which J. H.
Braly, a School Director, is president.
The warrant was for $72. She was
charged 70 cents for the accommoda
tion. The warrant had to run more
than a month before it could be col
lected from the County Treasurer.
Before cashing it she had spoken to
Mr. Braly about it, and he had agreed
to have the bank accommodate her.
Mr. Braly is a member of the League
for Better City Government, and was
indorsed by that organization.
It is expected that the defense will
close its case to-morrow night. The
prosecution will have rebuttal evi
dence to put in and arguments will
probably begin Monday.
C. J. Kubach was elected a member
of the School Board two weeks ago by
the City Council to succeed Joseph F.
Adams, the confessed boodler, who re
signed from the board. He will not be
a candidate for re-election. Kubach
was elected by four Republican votes
and by th(* fifth and controlling vote of
the Council, that of Herman Silver,
who represents the League for Better
City Government in that body. Ku
bach has participated in the reorgani
zation of the board, and it was sup
posed that he would stand as the Re
publican candidate at the election
which Is shortly to be held in the ward.
Last night Kubach, to the surprise of
every one, addressed a letter to the
secretary of the Republican city com
mittee absolutely declining to stand as
the Republican nominee in the ward.
It was supposed that Kubach would
appeal to the people of the Seventh
\\*;t'd to indorse his action in voting as
he did to reorganize the board. He has
been with the League for Better City
Government people, and has voted with
them all along.
When asked by a Call representative
to-night why he declined to make the
race Kubaeh said: '"I have private
reasons, which I decline to make pub
lic. I also have decided that I could
not be elected to the board, as the ward
is Democratic. Then, too, the good peo
ple would not turn out at a special
election, and all of the push would be
against me. They would all turn out
and my supporters would stay at home,
so I will not run."
McKINLEY
TALKS FOR
ANNEXATION
Continued from First Pa#e.
tapes, which were rapidly developing
in the far oast. He referred to the
Improvement of the commercial out
look between the United States and
China, and instanced the fact that one
Minnesota firm had exported half a
million dollars' worth of flour to that
country.
The last half-hour of Senator Davis'
speech was devoted to a recapitulation
of the subject, in which he dwelt at
considerable length, and portrayed in
strong language the origin and close of
great wars, which was intended to il
lustrate the probable ultimate result
of present operations in Chinese
waters.
When Senator Davis took hi? seat he
was congratulated by almost every
Senator present upon the force of his
argument, the thoroughness of his re
search and the brilliancy of his pre
sentation of facts. Both Senators
Hoar and Mason were heard to re
mark that it was a great pity the rules
of an executive session prevented the
publication of the entire document.
Senator Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska fol
lowed with a speech in opposition to
! the treaty, which was comparatively
â  brief. He called attention to the dis
tance of Hawaii from our own shores.
j referred to the necessity we would be
i under of defending the islands in case
: of war, and claimed that on this ae
| count it was necessary for the United
States to establish and maintain a sep
arate fleet for their protection as well
as an army on the islands. He said
i coal was no longer contraband of war,
and contended that the United States
was in far greater danger from the
British establishment at Esqulmalt
than it could possibly be because of
: the location of any foreign power in
Hawaii. He deprecated the idea of
assimilating such a population as that
of Hawaii, calling attention to the
fact that almost half of it was com
posed of Chinese and Japanese. He
i contended that the annexation of the
islands would open the doors for a vio
; lation of our laws for the exclusion of
Chinese, holding that they could not
find means to prevent Hawaii's becom
ing a State of the Union at some fu
ture day and declared that the people
of that country were not of a charac
ter calculated to send acceptable Sen
ators to Washington.
There was apparent to-day a dispo
sition on th.^ part of some Senators who
announce themselves undecided as to
what course to pursue on the Hawaiian
question to mix it with the Cuban prob
lem. They are friends of Cuba, and
their desire to have the administration
take a more pronounced position in the
interests of Cuba as a return for their
assistance on the Hawaiian treaty.
THE TREATY'S FRIENDS
SERIOUSLY ALARMED
FOR ITS PASSAGE.
Not a Single Republican Senator Can Be
Spared, and There Is More Than
One Now Wavering.
CHICAGO, Jan. 12.â The Inter
Ocean's special correspondent at
Washington, who has been a thick and
thin advorate of Hawaiian annexation,
has been forced to admit that the pro
ject is in danger of defeat at the hands
of the Senators. In his dispatch, pub
lished this morning, he says: "The
Hawaiian treaty is in danger, and the
danger is from Western Senators. Sen
ator Thurston of Nebraska openly op
posed annexation this morning. He has
sent a letter to his constituents declar
ing his opposition to the treaty and
giving as a reason his desire to give
better protection to the beet sugar in
dustry of his own State. Senator
Spooner gives no reason, nor does he
admit that he is opposed to annexa
tion, but he is giving no help to those
who are working for the treaty, and
they fear that on the vote he will be
recorded against them.
"Senator Mason, who had been re
garded as a staunch adherent of the
cause of annexation, is now counted as
lukewarm, if not actually in the camp
of the opposition. His lukewarmness
may be attributed to the fact that until
Cuba is free he thinks the United
States should not trouble itself regard
ing the Hawaiian Islands.
"If the Republican Senators stand to
gether it is possible that enough Dem
ocrats and silver men will act with
thetn to ratify the treaty, but no Re
publican Senator can be spared."
DEMANDS THAT JAPAN
PUNISH MURDERERS.
Administration Protests Against the Leni-
ency Accorded the Slayers of an
American.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
The administration is indignant at
the nominal sentence imposed by the
Japanese on the murderers of Ameri
can Naval Apprentice Frank Epps,
who met his death In the harbor of
Nagasaki last month.
I was told to-day that Minister Buck
had been instructed to protest against
the leniency shown the criminals and
to urge that they be given a sentence
commensurate with the enormity of
their crime.
The instruotion is the result of a
cablegram which the Navy Depart
ment received late yesterday after
noon from the commander in chief of
the Asiatic station. In his message
Commodore Dewey announced that
the trial of the criminals had been
concluded and they had been sen
tenced to pay a small fine.
In view of the facts in the case the
authorities say it is absurd for the
Japanese Government to permit the
escape of the murderers in the manner
reported by Commodore Dewey.
BRITISH SURVEY PARTY
ATTACKED IN BELOOCHISTAN.
Number of Native Guards Killed or

CALCUTTA, Jan. 12.â News has
been received from Metramul, in Be

British survey party there, numbering
200. A number of the native guards
were killed or wounded. The extent
of the outbreak is not known here.
Captain Burns reports that the

Captain Burns alone escaped.
REDS ARE EXCITED, BUT
NOT ON THE WARPATH.
WICHITA, Kans., Jan. 12.â A special
to the Eagle from Guthrie, O. T., says:
The Mayor of Shawnee, O. T., has
wired Governor Barnes that the report
ed Indian outbreak in the Seminole
country is a "'whisky scare." The
Sheriff of Pottawatomie County has
also wired the Governor that "he does
not believe any murders have been
committed. He reports the Indians as
tremendously excited, but not threat
ening. A later dispatch from Guthrie
says :

Captain and Two of Her
Crew Brought to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO. Jan. 12.â The schooner
Anita arrived this morning from Santo
Domingo, Lower California, with a
cargo of gold ore and several thousand
dollars in bullion. The Anita also
brought up Captain Charles Hart
wick, Harry Drent and Andrew An
derson of the schooner Wahlberg,
which was wrecked at Lagoon Heads,
300 miles south of San Diego, on De
cember 17.
On December 8 the schooner Wahl
berg left this port for the lower coast
to gather curios. She called at En
senada. At that port she took on a
Mexican customs official, his destina
tion being the Calmilli mines. Noth
ing unusual happened on the trip until
Lagoon Heads were reached, on De
cember 17. There the anchor was
dropped and the sails furled. A heavy
swell was rolling in on the beach, but
Captain Hartwick saw no danger. The
customs official was about to be land
ed in a small boat, when the anchor
chain parted and the schooner was
soon drifting in on the rocky coast.
The crew made heroic efforts to save
the vessel, but before anything could
be done she struck and in a few min
utes the bottom had pounded on the
rocks, smashing her to pieces.
The men escaped without injury, but
the vessel is a total loss. The men re
mained on the beach until the arrival
of the Anita. The Wahlberg was
owned by Professor A. W. Anthony of
this city. She was purchased from
Captain Martin and has been used to
take trips along the southern 1 coast,
gathering curios for the Smithsonian
institution. The trip previous to this
one consumed fiva months and several
tons of fish were secured by a Stan
ford student who took passage In the
vessel.
A letter was received yesterday by
Harry Robblns from Professor An
thony, the owner of the vessel, who is
at Portland, stating that he had a
charter for the vessel as soon as she
returned. The loss will fall very heav
ily on Professor Anthony, who had Just
had the schooner overhauled and many
improvements made to her. The Wahl
berg was valued at $2500 and was made
famous through her Hawaiian ex
ploits under a former owner.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLrMBT'P. Ohio, Jan. 12.â Marcus
A. Hanna was elected to-day to repre
sent Ohio in the Senate for seven years
and two months. If McKinley should
be re-elected Hanna would still be there
to the end of the President's second
term. Including both the short and the
long: terms, Hanna's time as Senator
will expire in March, 1905.
Less than two years ago Senator
Hanna entered politics in advocating
William McKinley's candidacy for the
Presidency. He was successful as the
leader of the McKinley forces at the St.
Louis convention and afterward as
chairman of the Republican National
Committee. For almost a year he has
been in the Senate as successor of Sec
retary John Sherman. Paring his short
service in public life Senator Hanna
has participated in hard lighting, but
he never before won such a victory as
that of to-
Although Mr. Hanna was duly de
clared Senator at noon tv-day for both
the long and short terms, yet the oppo

cause he was being used as a means
for creating a deadlock for the benefit
of others.
Previous to the joint balloting to
day ih'' opposition offered to support
'.and for the
phori. term, with McKisson for the long
term. Senator Dodge is a neighbor of
Benal In Cleveland and was
nominated and elected on pledges for
Hanna. Senator Dodge stated that the
Senators and Representatives from
Cleveland were instructed for Hanna
and indignantly rejected the proposal.
The opposition to-day knew it was
defeated before the joint balloting be
gan, but fought to the last on the
charges of bribery and coercion. In
the. joint balloting to-day there were
T.<> changes whatever by the Senators
over their two ballots of yesterday, for
the long and short terms. McKisscm
received niii"te._-n votes and Hanna
seventeen. When the roll of the House
was called it resulted in the ballots for
both terms as follows: Hanna, 56; Mc
ri. 51; Lentz, 1; tone absent,
< 'â :â >.
Joint ballots for both terms re-
Bulted as follows: Uanna, 73; McKis
fc"n, 70; l^entz, 1; (one absent, Cramer).
The official declarations showed that
Uanna had a plurality of three over
McKisson, a majority of two over all
_-. and of one over all the members
in the general assembly. The demon-
Ftrati.ms in the hall were unusually
enthusiastic.
Colonel J. I-i. Rogers, the secretary
t" the Governor, came to the Nell
lions'- at 4 p. m. bearing the commis
l â¢? Senator Hanna as a Senator for
the short term. Senator Hanna, ac
anied by Judg<* A. C. Thompson,
J..hn Little, .Major E. C. Rath
. Hun. <"harles Kinney, Judge
-:-:- K. Nash, Congressmen North
way, Grosvenor and Burton and Hon.
J. Warren Keifer, repaired to the
ladles' parlor, where Colonel Rogers, in
ting the commission to Senator
Hanna, said:
"Senator Hanna, I have the honor to
..t to you your commission as
Vnitf-d States Senator for the short
tprm. a copy of which has been sent
t<> the President to-day. Tour com
mission for the long t"rm will be sent
t" you within a few days, and a copy
also forwarded to the President of the
Senate."
Senator Hanna, in reply, said:
"Colonel Rogers, I thank you and
appreciate this, and I give back to the
Ft ate my pledge that I will execute the
power given to me to the fullest extent
of my ability, and will do my best to
Eerve the interests of all the people of
my State."
Previous to the two houses of the
Legislature going into joint convention
at noon for the election of Senator, res
olutions were offered in both houses for
an investigation of the bribery charges
made by Representative Otis of Ham
ilton County. After the election of
Hanna the House adjourned until to
morrow with its resolution still under
consideration. Consideration of this
resolution was resumed in the Senate
this afternoon and adopted by a vote
of 22 to 6. The dissenting votes were
Senators Blake, Carpenter, Garfield,
May, Sullivan and Voight, who ex
plained that they regarded the matter
as buncombe.' The Republicans vot
ing with the Democrats for the adop
tion of the resolutions were Sertators
Burke, Cable, Crandall, Lutz, Riley,
"WH ghtman and Wolcott. There were
eight Senators absent, or not voting.
After the adoption of the resolution
to investigate all bribery charges, the
Bramley bill to repeal the fifty-year
street-railway franchise law was dis
cussed at length with many passages
on the recent Senatorial contest. The
bill was amended and passed.
Among the Representatives during
the afternoon there was a considerable
agitation of a proposition to reorgan
ize the House by ousting Speaker Ma
pon and all other officers of that body
that had been elected by the fusion ten
days ago. it was claimed that the
fifty-six Representatives who voted for
Hanna to-day and constituted a ma
jority of three in the House would
stand together for that purpose.

DISGRACEFUL CONCESSIONS
MADE BY THE CHINESE.
Must Even Meet the Expenses Incurred by
Germany in the Seizure of
Kiaochau.
VANCOUVER, Jan. 12. â Th*
Eteamer Empress of <'hina, which ar
rived from the Orient to-day, brings
details in reference to the occupation
of Kiaochau. China has agreed to the
following demands of Germany:
"Indemnity for the German mission
aries who were killed; the erection of
a memorial church at the scene of tho
murder; the payment of expenses in
curred by Germany in the occupation
of Kiaochau; the permanent dismissal
from the public service of Li Ping
Heng; the retiring of the Governor of
Shantung and the recently appointed
Viceroy of Szechuen, and the severest
punishment of those who murdered
the priests and of the local authorities
where the crime was committed. Re
garding special privileges to be gTant
ed Germany with reference to coal
mines and railways in Shan
tung, the precedent adopted In the
convention between China and France
in 1895 is to be followed"
Japan has issued instructions that
those in authority shall see that for
eigners are treated with the greatest
respect.
Pirates have been committing depre
dations in the French settlements at
Haijohn, and even in the vicinity
of Hongkong itself. On the 15th ult
a gang of 800 pirates attacked the sub
urbs of Haijhong, which Is inhabited
by Europeans, setting nre in places
simultaneously in four quarters. The
desperadoes were fired upon by a
party of French marines and about
thirty killed.
Two Europeans were murdered and
a quantity of property stolen or dam
aged by fire. In the vicinity of Hong
kong pirates have confined themselves
to the capture of Junks in which they
secured property valued at 10,000.
Since the establishment of Germany
at Kiaochau Dame Rumor has been
very busy in Hongkong, but at the
time the Empress left all residents
there were agreed that the British gar
risons at Singapore and Hongkong
must be Immediately Increased. In
consequence of the Kiaochau affair ex
tra precautions are being taken, ac
cording to the native papers, to protect
missionaries and their property. The
churches in many places are being
guarded by Chinese braves.
Two priests arrested by the Chinese
authorities in connection with the al
leged fraudulent sale to Russia of land
in the Kuikiang Mountains have died
as a result of tortures. Three more
are in prison, and it is feared will meet
a similar fate.
A native telegram received from
Peking reports that Viceroy Chang
Chin Tung has energetically protested
to the throne against granting of the
German demands, and he especially
protests against the dismissal of ex-
Governor Li Ping Heng, whom he de
clares to have been in nowise to blame
in the matter of the recent murder of
German priests.
He fears that if LI Ping Heng be
dismissed the other Viceroys and Gov
ernors will resent the injustice done
to their colleagues. The Viceroy fur
ther declares that the people are loyal
to the throne and only need men to
lead them. His Excellency offers him
self as one of several high officials of
the empire who will be willing to lay
down their lives if necessary for the
dynasty.

DUNHAM BELIEVED TO
HAVE COMMITTED THE
NEWTON BUTCHERY
Massachusetts Officers Charge
the Crime to the Fugitive
Murderer of the Me-
GHncy Family.
CHICAGO. Jan. 12.â A Boston special says: The police and detect
ives working- on the Newton family butchery at Brockfleld are of the
opinion that Muller, the hired man believed to be the murderer, Is
none other than James C. Dunham, who foully murdered wife, mother
in-law, stepfather, brother-in-law, servant girl and hired man near
San Jose, Cal., on May 27, 1896.
The strange likeness existing between those two revolting crimes,
the evident motives which prompted their commission, and the ruth
less craving for blood displayed by the murderer on each occasion
seem to link the two murders together, to establish room for the al
most natural deduction that both crimes were committed by the same
person. The description of Muller given out by the police tallies to a
dot with that of Dunham in almost every respect, and the movements
of Muller, as far as accounted for, take up the thread of Dunham's
whereabouts at the time it was lost by the detectives working on the
On June 26 word was received that Dunham had been seen and
recognized in Boston by a former friend, who notified the San Fran
cisco police. Detectives Gibson and Anthony were Immediately dis
patched to this city, but all clews as to the fugitive's whereabouts
had been lost.

SACRAMENTO. Jan. 12.â A shock

the little village of Clarksburg, on the

south of this city. Jeffle Cabe, a young
son of one of the most prominent of
Yolo's old-time fanners, shot and killed
his brother-in-law. Louis I sham, in a
quarrel over a trifling matter. The af
fair occurred at the pumphouse of the
Lisbon reclamation district, where both
men were at work. Cabe Insisted on
hauling away some cinders, to which
Isham objected. They had some hot
words over the matter, and Isham went
to his house and got his pistol. When
he returned Cabe had a load of cinders.
with which he was about to drive away,
when Isham stopped his team. An-
Other wrangle ensued, and it is said
that Isham either drew his pistol or
attempted to do so when Cabe grabbed
his shotgun and fired. The charge took
effect in the breast, neck and face of
Isham, and he died this afternoon.
Cabe claims he acted in self-defense.
About 5 o'clock Cabe was seen at
Freeport on his way to Sacramento,
and told a friend that he was going
there to engage a lawyer. Coroner
Bean of Woodland has been notified of
the shooting and will go after the body
to-morrow morning.
Isham has a host of friends about
Clarksburg, and fears are entertained
that should Cabe return to that locality
there may be some demonstration
against him. Isham was a married
man and leaves a widow, sister of his
player, and three children to mourn
him. while Cabe was single. Cabe will
be arrested as soon as the necessary
papers can be taken out.

Valley, about twenty miles east of
this city, by Deputy Sheriff Tenant,

When confronted by his victim Irwin
told Brown that he was Innocent of
the crime charged, when Brown said
"Why, I saw you standing over me
with the pistol In your hand and saw
you when you struck me the blow
which knocked me Benseless." The ac
cused said: "You are mistaken but
if you say so I suppose I am in for it "
Only $10 was found upon Irwin An
other $10 he gave "Big Jim" Mcllraith
to purchase goods for him. The rest
of the money is supposed to be burled

EpÂ«;lal Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND. Or., Jan. 12â A harrow
ing tale of a triple tragedy In a gypsy
camp about ten miles south of Mc-
Minnvllle was 1 rought here to-day by
Frank Burroughs, a commercial
traveler.
A band of forty gypsies, bound for
California, camped on the scene of the
tragedy lest Satu. lay night. Intend
ing to proceed on their way the Mon
day morning following. Sunday fore
noon a two-year-old child of Andrew
Ustrander, the chief, fell into a fiercely
raging fire built of fallen trees. The
screams of the infant attracted the at
tention of its mother, who was only a
liczt-n yards away. Crmsed with ex
citement at seeing her little one being
devoured by the flames the woman
thoughtlessly leaped into the fire, in
which both she and the child were
burned to death in a few minutes. ()s
trander's efforts to savi' his wifeâ who
must have gone st.-yk mad at witness
ing the horrible fate of her offspringâ
proving futile, he slashed his throat
with a razor, bleeding to death in a
short time.
"I met the caravan of gypsies late
Monday afternoon as I was driving
from McMinnvllle to Lafayette," said
Mr. burroughs, "when the elder' son of
Ostrander, a strapping fellow of 23
years, then the acting thief O f the tribe,
halted me and voluntarily told me of
the fearful occurrence Sunday. These
three lives, of course, count for noth
ing as the world goes, yet it was a piti
ful tragedy, all the same. Young Os
trander told me that the Coroner of
Yamhill County had not been notified
of the three deaths, because the tribe
is governed by its own laws. They had
the charred remains of the woman and
her child and the body of Ostrander in
one of the wagons. Their remains will
be taken to the redwoods in San Mateo
County, Cal., where hundreds of the
Romany race hiive been Interred in the
pa^t thirty years."

there at about 10:30. It would then be
consigned to the crematory, and in
j-dx hours would be in ashes. Then
the parents were to have the ashes in
an urn.
Mr. and Mrs. Durrant left the train
at River station and were driven at
once to the undertakers in a hack.
Here they awaited the arrival of the
box containing the body. Then they
held a consultation with the under
takers as to the arrangements that
had been made. They expressed them
selves as satisfied with the details.
The statement is made to-night that
servio.-s will bo held at the crematory
according 1 to the Catholic ritual. In
quiry fails to either affirm or deny the
rumor. The sealed casket will not be
opened with the consent of the par
ents. Both are opposed to anything of
the kind, as they do not wish or de
sire that any one shall again view the
remains. Mrs. Durrant was quite
calm and collected. In conversation
she said:
"I cannot bear the thought of losing
him. even now."
The father was resigned in his de
meanor. II. > inquired carefully after
all details and expressed himself as
satisfied.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Durrant will,
it is reported. remain here a
short time after the cremation to visit
Mr. Durrant's mother, who resides
here. She is an elderly woman, but
has some very pronounced views as to
the manner in which the body of her
grandson has been handled.
At 10:X0 p. m. Mr. and Mrs. Durrant
became thoroughly convinced that no
attempt would be made by any one to
disturb the body, and they then con
sented to leave the undertakers and
X" to a private house and obtain rest.
They left two private detectives be
hind to guard the body.
"If he had been guilty he ought to
have died. But he was innocent â
there is no doubt of that â and this per
secution, continued even after he is
dead, is brutal. I can't expresa it any
other way. The undertaker who has
withstood public opinion and had hu
manity enough to think about the f<-el
in.es of the poor boy's parents in this
matter, is a noble man and haÂ« our
heartfelt thanks. You may be sure that
we shall r.ot forget his act."
TO HOLD BACK THE CROWD.
Officers to Be Stationed Around the Pasa-
dena Crematory.
PASADENA. Jan. 12.â The remains
of Durrant were not cremated here this
afternoon, as expected, although every
thing was in readiness, and the body
reached Los Angeles at 1:45 p. m., ac
companied by the parents. It is the wish
of the Durrants that the casket be
cremated with the body, but Reynolds
& Van Xuys say the body will be re
moved as usual and placed in the cre
matory.
It is feared a crowd of sonsation
hunters will follow the remains from
Los Angeles, and the Mayor has taken
steps to protect the crematory from the
crowd, and an effort will be made to
keep the curious out, although this will
be difficult if not impossible. Reynolds
& Van Nuys have been annoyed all day
by applications to witners the crema
tion, and have also been the recipients
of a large number of congratulatory
telegrams upon the stand they have
taken in the matter.
GOVERNOR BUDD CITED
TO APPEAR IN COURT
Must Show Cause Why He Does Not Dec/are
a Certain Act of the Last Legis
lature a Law.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 12.â Governor
I Budd has been cited to appear in the
Superior Court of this county on Sat
urday next to show cause why he
does not declare a certain bill passed
by the last Legislature a law. This or
der Is made in response to the applica
tion of W. J. Gavigan of San Francisco
j for a writ of mandate to that effect.
The last Legislature passed a bill
creating the office of sociological expert
in cities having 25.000 school children
or over (San Francisco). Ten days af
ter its passage Governor Budd vetoed
the bill, but Gaviganâ in wWbse inter
, est it is said to have been passed â has
'â â  always claimed that more than ten
! days elapsed before the Governor sent
: his vote to the Senate, and that the bill
I la in force.
The San Francisco authorities elected
Gavigan to the office, and he brought
the action against the Governor to
compel him to promulgate the bill as a
law. Gavigan's claim is that the Gover
nor allowed nearly three hours in ex
cess of the legal ten days to pass before
the Senate was notified of his vote.

for DeArmond
of Missouri.
Says He Is a Common
Scold and Hints at
Heroic Treatment.
Bitter Debate Over an Item in
an Urgent Deficiency
Measure.
PASSAGE OF THE BILL.
Proviso Requiring Gold Bullion
Owners to Pay for Transporta
tion to Mints Defeated.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
"Washington, Jan. 12.
The House to-day passed an urgent
deficiency bill, carrying: $1,741,843. One
of the Items, authorizing a further ex
penditure of $")l'o,ooo for the Soldiers'
Home at Danville, 111., for which $150.
000 was appropriated in the sundry civil
bill, was used by DeAnnond of Mis
souri as a basis for a bitter personal
attack upon Chairman Cannon, whose
home is at Danville. He charged that
Cannon, after using his power on the
Appropriations Committee to get the
home located in his homo town, waÂ« now
trying to take half a million dollars out
of the treasury to help people Interest
ed in Danville town lots.
Cannon replied in a sarcastic speech,
and accused the member from Missouri
of being a common scoldâ such, he said,
as were ducked at the town pump in
the olden days. He insisted that addi
tional barracks were needed at Dan
ville, where 18,000 veterans were now
sleeping in corridors, cellars and attics.
DeArmond's motion was defeated
without division.
There was also a lively debate over
the provision in the bill requiring the
owners (if bullion hereafter to pay the
cost nf transporting bullion from assay
offices to the mints. Hell (P.) of Colo
rado argued that if the Government de
clined to pay the cost of transporting
thf gold would so to foreign mints. It
was, he said, another blow aimed at
the Western miner.
Snafroth (811. X.) of Colorado argued
against the proviso. Not content with
the gold standard, he said, this was an
attempt to discourage the production
of gold and still further appreciate its
(tower and value.
Cannon pointed out that if the law
â was continued until an assay office
Would bÂ«Â» -stiitilished on the Yukon, the
Government would have to pay the
mint price for gold in the Klondike and
then pay the cost of, and assume all
risks incident to, transporting to the
Ban Francisco or Philadelphia mint.
This law whs a bounty on gold mining.
Why should it exist? He protested
against trying to complicate it with
the financial question.
McÃae CD.) of Arkansas argued that
thp gold discoveries in the Yukon fur
nish--.1 the best reason why the exist
ing law should not be discountenanced,
The Government should offer every in
ducement to miners to bring their gold
to Its mints.
Savers (D.) of Texas supported the
proposed change In the Government
policy. There was no more reason, ho
said, why the Government should give
a bounty to the gold miners than to
the cotton and wheat growers. Nn
other country, he said, paid the freight
on bullion.
Livingston (D.) of Georgia denied
that this proposition in any way affect
ed the financial issue. He favored it.
Kelly (P.) of Rcruth Dakota, Dockery
(D.) of Missouri and Bland (D.) of
Missouri opposed the proviso. The lat
ter in his remarks said the present law
was a part of the resumption act of
1579. It was intended to encourage and
facilitate gold production, and, coupled
with it, was the law providing for the
Bale of bonds to provide gold. The en
couragement of gold production was
the cheaper and better way to procure
gold. The new proviso was in the in
terest of bond sales.
After some further remarks by Simp
eon (P.) of Kansas and Underwood
(D.) of Alabama against the proviso.
Bell's motion to strike out the proviso
was defeated â 125 to 110.
On motion Bell's (Colorado) amend
ment was adopted providing for the
survey and establishment of the east
ern boundary lino of the Southern Ute
reservation in Colorado. Without fur
ther amendment the bill was passed.

Men Just Out From the Klondike Say
tho Weather Is Unusually
Mild.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JTJNEAU, Alaska, Jan. 7 (by steam
ship Al-Kl to Seattle, Jan. 12>.â A party
of twenty-five Yukoners aboard the Al-
Xi, bound for Seattle, report unusually
mild weather on the trail from Daw
son, since about the middle of Decem
ber. Heretofore returning Klondikers
have appeared here with the skin peel
ing from their faces, and with hands
and feet frostbitten in many cases. This
last party reports the river open for
short distances and a comparatively
pleasant experience. About 500 Klon
dikers are behind them on the trail.
J. S. McAuley and Dick Kutler of Vic
toria, B. C, claim to haveTnade the trip
from Dawson to Dyea in eighteen days,
which breaks the record by nearly five
days. All the party say that the dan
ger of actual starvation has passed,
owing to so many leaving. J. P.
Walker of Pittsburg. Pa., said he knew
of sixteen sacks of flour which found
no purchasers at $?.", a sack, whereas
six weeks ago $150 a sack was offered
for flour. Bacon, beans and rice have
cheapened in proportion. Nearly every
man in the party left between Decem
ber 1 and 12.
News of the nature of an official
warning is brought by the party from
Major Strickland, of tho Canadian
police, stationed at Lake Taglsh. He
sends out word that the proposed Gov
ernment relief expedition is impracti
cable and unfeasible in every way and
cannot succeed. The Canadian police
have been on the river for months, are
short of supplies at some of their sta
tions, and, it is said, will not be able
to establish the proposed stations be
tween Dyea and Dawson before the
river opens, pome time next May or
June, owing to the great physical diffi
culties, short days and other obstacles
to be overcome when it Is undertaken
to transport a larger quantity of pro
visions in the winter time.
Other conditions and the situation at
Dawson are about at last reported. The
construction of new buildings to re
place the church and other structures
burned has begun.
HAL HOFFMAN.
JUST A DAWSON FAIRY TALE.
Yukoners Ridicule the Story That the
Mother Lode Has Been Found.
SEATTLE, Jan. 12.â The steamer Al-
Xi brought down forty-two more min
ers this morning from the land of
plenty gold. It is estimated that these
returning Klondikers had with them
gold and drafts aggregating in value
about $100,000. The latest party out
from Dawson left on December 12. three
days later than several who came on
the City of Topeka. As a consequence
they bring but very little additional
news.
The last party to leave Dawson wa*
composed of Richard Butler of Ells
worth, Minn., and James McCaully of
Victoria. They covered the distance to
Dyea in eighteen and a half days,
starting from Dawson on December 12
with an outfit weighing 600 pounds,
which was brought out on a sled drawn
by five dogs. Mr. Butler went into the
Yukon country in the spring of 1896.
He built the second cabin in Dawson in
September of that year, when the
stampede commenced. Speaking to
The Call correspondent he said:
"Myself and brothers have several
locations on the streams tributary to
the Klondike and expect big returns in
the spring. Last June we took in about
four tons of provisions, but are pretty
well run out now. I will return In a
few weeks with another outfit. The
fact that a great number of men are
coming out has had a tendency to make
provisions more plentiful, and they can
now be bought for from $1 to $1 50 a
pound. I heard nothing about the dis
covery of the mother lode or any rich
quartz claims until I reached Seattle.
There was some quartz found on
j El Dorado Creek, but it caused no ex-
I citement whatever."
Sam Archer, who was formerly em
ployed on a newspaper in Seattle, has
returned for a few weeks. In convers
| ing with The Call correspondent this
afternoon he said on an all important
subject:
"There Is a shortage In the food sup
ply at Dawson. There may be some
suffering, but there â will be no starva
tion in the Klondike this season. The
situation was greatly relieved by the de
parture for the outside over the ice of
several hundred men, majiy of whom
had outfits to dispose of. Of course
there is nothing in the way of staple
provender to be purchased In the open
market, but there are many private- in
dividuals who have more than they
need to last them through the Beason,
and by rustling around v little one can
buy small stocks here and there at
about $1 S5 a pound for flour, $1 50 for
rice, $1 to Jl 2-j for bacon, beans, dried
fruit and mush materials, $J2 for baking
powder, etr. These figures may ad
vance as the supply to be had becomes
scarcer, but I am satisfied that there
will be no starvation."
Mr. Archer says that the story con
cerning the discovery of the mother
lode in Skonkqm Gulch is a fairy tale.
He never heard it in the Klondike nor
from any Of the miners who came down
on the Al-Ki. While he is satisfied of
the great richness of the Yukon region,
yet he believes? that there hus been
much exaggeration. He said:
"From all reports I have heard one
would suppose every claim located in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 13, 1898.
the Klondike was a bonanza. The
truth is there are many claims on the
best creeks that are not worth work
inp. Take Bonanza Creek, the rich
stream that first attracted the stam
peders. It has many fabulously rich de
posits of gold in it. but the rreek Is
spotted. There are many claims that
are blanks, nnd money spent working
them is thrown away. Much of the
ground on Bonanza is let out on lays,
50 per cent being given the lessee, and
a number of these lays arc being
thrown up after holes have been sunk
and a thorough prospect has failed to
Uncover pay dirt. All the creeks and
quiches for mites about Dawson an
staked and recorded, and one must go
a lonp distance away over lmuintain
and through brush to. lind unlocated
placer claims.
"Speaking of the general staking of
anything and everything f<>r wildoat
speculation reminds me of the great
amount <>f perjury committed In the
recorder's office at Dawson. Not one
In a hundred of the claims stak> .1 is
prospected before being recorded, ret
the office is thronged daily by CTOWda
who stand before the eOAniissioner
and solemnly swear that they found
gold (in the claim staked.
"There is great dissatisfaction with
the new Dominion mining regulations
reducing the size of claims to 100 feet
and requiring payment to the Govern
ment of a heavy royalty on the gold
taken out. It is very generally assert
ed that the royalty cannot be coll<
next clean-up unless a deputy is sta
tioned at every dump."
Colonel C, F. Treat, formerly n
prominent Seattle business man. came
out to take in a supply of provisions.
He has been chairman of the various
meetings held at Dawson to consider
the food situation. He believes that
the Government relief expedition can
reach Dawson over the ice by usinc
dogs, and that its arrival will prove
timely. The Impending famine h;is
been averted, he believes, by the peo
ple coming out and going down the
river.

DISCOURAGED
Sees No Chance to Bring
< Fitz and Corbett
Together.
Says the Game Is Blocked and
It Lets Him Out for the
Time Being.
Martin Julian Promises That Bob
Will Thrash Jim When Next
They Meet.
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â Dan Stuart
arrived in the city to-nipht, after mak
ing an unsuccessful journey to St. Paul
tn try and persuade Robert Fitzslm
mons to sign articles to light James J.
Corbett a return battle.
"There seems little chance of getting
these two x-i'Ti together again," Baid
Stuart in answer to the first question
l>ut to him regarding the chances of
another meeting of the two men. "The
situation stands this way," continued
Stuart. "Corbett is willing to fight, but
Fltzsimmona dictates that he shall first
fight }'-\>r Maher. This Corbett re
fuses to r],>; consequently the game is
blocked. So far as l am concerned, it
lets me out for the time being, and
unless the two principals come to some
other conclusion, I have accomplished
nothing by my trip West."
"This being th- case are you going
to try and arrange for other bouts?"
was asked.
"Not that I know of. of course, if
Corbett should consent to meet Mahcr,
I should make a bid for the contest
lust ti> get it out of the way; but I am
n -t looking tor any other bout. I shall
have nothing more t" say on the mat
ter until Corbett and Fitzsimmons get
together and one of them gives way."
A special to the Herald from St. Paul
says: Martin Julian said this after
noon that ii Corbett and Fitzstmmons
should visit the same town there would
:>â¢â  ;i fight H" says that Fitzsimmons
is angry because Corbett sent him a
dispatch from Cincinnati to the effect
that tin/ champion ran away from Chl
cago to keep from meeting him. "Pa
tience has ceased to be a virtue with
Pita," said Julian. "So y^u may say
that whenever Mr. Corbett does meet
Fitz. Mr. Corbett will get the worst
licking he ever had in all his born
days. I promise you that Bob will put
him asleep a good d>-al pounder than
he did at Carson."
"We are not looking for trouble."
continued Julian, "but I take It that
any man has a right to go about this
country peaceably attending to his
business, and If Corbett comes our way
after the threats he has been making
it will be fair enough to assume that he
wants to make a grand-stand play at
our expense.
"Well, he will be carried away on a
stretcher. This is the tlrst time that I
have replied in this manner to any of
til.- remarks Corbett has made, but I
repeat that if Corbett c nies looking for
Fitz he will get an awful licking."

REDWOOD CITY, Jan. 12.â The mat
ter of selecting a jury in the case of
the People vs. Harry Winters, for the
murder of C. A. Andrews, was resumed
this morning before Judge Buck. But
five jurors had been accepted last
night. The remainder were chosen
shortly after the noon recess to-day.
Those sworn to try the case are the
following: G. Plump, William Plunii>,
Chase Lilttlejohn, John Heaney, M.
Crow, William Chappel, George Win
ters, j. w. Glennan, Henry Mourot, C.
L. Qould, P. Xealon and Ben Smith.
After District Attorney Walker had
stated to the jury what he expected to
prove, he called Patrick Ferriter, pro
prietor of the Orand Hotel, who testi
fied that he had seen the defendant in
South San Francisco three different
times, the first time on the 9th or 10th
of November, the second time on the
afternoon and evening of November
16th and the last time about 2 o'clock
on the morning of November 17. He
positively identified the defendant :is
the man seen by him on these <li;t
occasions. He related the circumstance
of this last visit minutely and fully,
and with the aid of a map or plan of
the second story of the Hrand Hot< I
building, showed where and how he
met the supposed robber and murderer.
About 2 o'clock In the morning Fer
riter said he was awakened by the
growling and barking of his dog, which
sleeps at thÂ»^ door "f his bedroom. He
jumped out of bed and opened the door
and observed a man standing about
five feet away. He spoke to him and
asked him what he wanted there at
that time of night. Winters, for Fer
riter recognized him, said he wished to
procure a quart of whisky and asked
the proprietor to go down and get it for
him. Ferriter refused to do so and told
him to- get out or the dog would eat
him up.
They started together toward the
stairs, Ferrtter going in that direction
to silence his dog, fearing the noise
would wake up the boarders. He went
on dcrwn the hall, and on returning no
ticed a man in a crouching position.
He suspected something wrong, nor
were his suspicions groundless, for
when he reached a position almost op
posite the party he was commanded to
throw up his hands. Instead of com
plying he jumped at the man and
grasped him by the arm. He succeed
ed in wresting the revolver from his
hand and then called for help.
They wen wrestling back and forth
in the hall when John Ferriter came,
out of his room, and together they
succeeded In getting the man down.
A man by the name of McNamara also
came out of his room, attracted by
the noise. Ferriter then called for a
light and C. A. Andrews opened his
door and started toward the men with
a candle. That Winters had a pal is
very evident, for when they were scuf-
Hing on the floor some one down the
stairs shouted, "Let my pal go or I'll
riddle you with bullets." As Andrews
came forth with the light this second
man, who is identified as the man
Raymond, commenced firing. He dis
charged four shots from his revolver,
which wounded Connelly and killed
Andrews. The man Winters escaped
from his captors and fled in the dark
ness.
That robbery was the motive ap
peared from the fart that Winters mkis
in the hotel on the afternoon of the
Wth and h<-;inl remarks made that that
day was payday at the Parkins Works
and that Ferriter would have consid
erable money, about $300, In the .build
ing.
The court adjourned before Ferriter
had completed his testimony.
Attorney Nagle is liable to be In
contempt of court for speaking with
one who last night was a prospective
Juror. It happened on the train going
north and the Constable from P'>uth
San Francisco overheard the remarks
passed between the parties and in
formed the court this morning. What
action the court will take In the mat
ter remains to be seen.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 12.â At 2:30 this
afternoon the officers of the law en
tered the office formerly occupied by
Edwin K. Alsip and levied a writ of
attachment upon the personal proper
ty to cover a demand made by Judge
Joseph Hughes, as administrator of the
estate of James MeMassar, for whom
Alsip had collected rents amounting to
$308.
It would seem from this that Mr. Al
sip is, as charged, short in his accounts
with his clients. George Clark will lose
in the neighborhood of JluO which has
been collected by Alsip as his agent.
The rumor that Alsip decamped in
company -with a woman n<>t his wife is
denied, and those who know claim that
the woman referred to is still in the
city.
There is not the slightest doubt in
this city that Alsip has left Sacramen
to for good, and in some quarters are
heard rumors of fears that he has com
mitted suicide. This morning the signs
on Alsip's ofllee were changed to con
form to the name of a new firm formed
of employes of the missing man. to

An elderly lady living at Fordham HeijthW. a part of New York City, and who
was known to ba a warm advocate of Ripans Taboles for any case of liver trouble or
indigestion, said toa reporter who visited her for the purpose of learning the particu
i a of her case: *â¢ I had always employed a physician and did so on the last occasion
I had for one, but at that time obtained no beneficial result?. I had never had any
faith in patent medicine?, but having seen Ripans Tabules recommended very hiizhlv
in the New York fftmU, I concluded to eive them a trial, and I found they were lust
what my case demanded. 1 have never employed a physician since, and that means â¢
sa vine of 82 a call. A dollar's worth of **
lasts me a month, and I would not be without them now if it were my last 'dollar â¢Â»
At the time of this interview there were present two daughters whospecfalW obw^d
to their mother giving: a testimonial which should parade her name in th^â¢
â¢ . papers, but to this tho elder lady argued : " There may be other case? just like mini'
and lam sure I take (treat pleasured recommending the tabuks to any -cmc urtÂ£-ri3i

whom a bill of sale was given by Mrs
Alsip, who had been given a need of
her husband's personal property.
Conjectures as to the shape in which
Alstp'a affairs have been left vary con
siderably. Some say that the family
of the missing: man will be left penni
less, as the deeds to his wife are said
to be no good as against his other
creditors. Others say that Alsip was
a wealthy man and that his debts will
he paid in full, although this is hardly
consistent with hie disappearance. Al-
Blp, in his capacity as a real estate
agent, ha? collected sums of money in
rents and interest on mortgages for
various clients of his firm, who claim
that settlements have not been made
in certain of these cases. n ,,^ a
The result of such conduct, of course,
must be the invoking of the machinery
of the law in an attempt to overtake
him and bring him back. It is asserted
that Alsip must have taken with him
considerable money, but of course this
cannot be learned until an examination
of his accounts is made. Many of these
losses, if such there shall prove to be,
will have to be sustained by peop c
with small holdings intrusted to his
care. s ,
Alfred Olsen, an employe of Alsip,
in an interview with a Bee reporter
this morning as to why Alsip's office
had been closed, said: "It was evident
to us at this time that it would not be
possible for us to go ahead with the
business under the circumstances. \\ c
had every reason to believe that Mr.
Alsip's affairs were heavily involved
and we did not care to take one man s
money to pay off a debt to some one
else."

MORE MONEY NEEDED.
AT the meeting on Wednesday evening of the
finance committee of the Golden Jubilee it was
reported that about $ij.ooo has been contri
buted to the fund for the celebration. In itself that
is a good round sum, but not sufficient for the occa
sion. To carry out the grand pageant on the lines
designed and to make it a memorable feature of the
year will require upward of $.20,000. The contribu
tions reported are therefore far short of the amount
required to accomplish a genuine triumph. More
money is needed.
It is hardly possible the progressive and enterpris
ing people of the city will permit the celebration to
fall short of expectation in any particular by reason
of the lack of a comparatively few thousand dollars.
It ought not to require personal visiting and solicit
ing to raise $jo,ooo in a city of the size and wealth
of San Francisco for a purpose that will redound so
much to its profit and its credit. The bare announce
ment that such an amount of money is requisite to
accomplish an object which the city has undertaken
ought to be sufficient to bring it promptly in liberal
donations.
San Francisco lias* recently had some striking ob
ject lessons proving the benefits of co-operation in
public enterprises. She has seen the Valley Road
constructed by the energy of her own people and
with money subscribed at home. She has seen not
able improvements carried out in street cleaning,
paving and lighting by the wisely directed efforts of
an association of merchants. The jubilee movement
is. of course, not commensurate in magnitude with
these efforts of joint action, but nevertheless it tends
to the welfare of the city, and if supported with the
vigor it merits will prove beneficial not only by at
tracting visitors to the city, but by introducing the
mining exposition with a parade that will advertise
it all over the Union.
The time for preparation is short. The time in
which to make opportune contributions is still
shorter. The money is needed. The civic patriotism
of the people is appealed to. Make your subscrip
tions promptly.
THE VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
rHF.RE has been some mention in the public
prints of Mr. Zanoli of New York. Zanoli is
a barber, and. for aught appearing to the con
trary, a good one. But he has been in some re
spects unfortunate. For instance, every woman he
married no sooner got accustomed to the domestic
detail than she died. With a thoughtfulness most
rnre, Zanoli had foreseen the possibility and pro
vided for it by having the woman insured. Habit
ually, he dried his tears, got married some more and
again procured a policy, so that if the new partner
of his joys should be called hence he would not be
left as one comfortless. He was also worried some
what by the untimely death of other relatives, and
the fact that they all happened to have been insured
in his favor created a prejudice against him. Finally
the police, as it Zanoli's cup of woe was not already
slopping over, arrested him in a manner most un
feeling. They seemed to have no sympathy for one
whose wives had been torn from him in regular pro
cession, leaving him nothing but tender memories
and policies convertible into cash. But the multi
widower is to be free. The cruel alfegations of the
police could not be proved. Some are born to grief
as the sparks to fly upward. The barber is evi
dently one of the lot.
Legislation concerning seals has reached a stage
of complexity at which the details can be grasped
only by the mind trained in diplomacy. Yet it is
clear to all that no regulation which provides for
taking the cloak of? the back of a lady who has not
only paid for the garment, but. owing to the ex
igencies of weather, actually needs it, will ever be
come popular.
It is hard to see why James W. Flood, the em
bezzling cashier of the Donohoe-Kelly Bank, should
be entitled to a pardon. He can make the plea that
he stole more than most of his fellow convicts, that
he had less need to steal it, and that his conviction
was slow and difficult. But after saying all these
tilings the case made out is not impressive.
There will be little objection to the course of the
Senate in refusing to pension the daughters of Gen
eral Meade. It is true there is a natural impulse to
give* money to any lady who may need it and ask for
it. but to permit this to control the pension business
would inevitably lead to trouble.
Perhaps there has been a meaner piece of jour
nalistic work than the deliberate attempt of the Ex
aminer to create ill feeling between Warden Hale
and his subordinates. But if there has the files of
that remarkable journal would have to be searched
for a record of it.
Whether or not the Seminoles go upon the war
path owing to the lynching of two of their people,
this country generally does not believe in burning
anybody at the stake. A civilization which permit 3
such a possibility has rotten spots, and a large spot
of this character seems to embrace Oklahoma.
THE SCHOOL SCANDAL.
WE are not surprised that a portion of the Los
Angeles press should resent our attempt to
publish a fair statement of the school scan
dal in that city. It is so unusual for a California
newspaper to present both sides of a political con
troversy without color that we do not blame our
esteemed contemporaries in the southern city for
manifesting their amazement with a round of abuse.
In our defense we need only invite the fair minded
public to a consideration of some of the "arguments"
which have been used to prove The Call's bias. They
at once disclose the animus of the criticisms and
charges.
It was not to be expected that the Los Angeles
papers which have taken sides in the school scandal
would tamely submit to an unprejudiced recital of
the facts concerning the affair. The last thing ap
parently they have desired was to see the truth in
print. This being the case, it is quite natural that
they should prove their utter want of honest mo
tives and a judicial disposition by hurling at us
charges of all sorts, not the least of which is an alle
gation that Mr. Webb and his "backers" have paid
for the publication of their side of the story in The
Call. If this were true it would disgrace the press
which makes the charge. The mere fact that a man
accused of political crime is compelled to travel 500
miles to find a paper in which to publish his state
ment ought to prove conclusively that all the local
sheets are paid to abuse him.
We have done nothing more in this matter than to
make public a few facts. What the Los Angeles
Times calls a "defense" of Walter L. Webb was his
signed statement, for which we did not vouch and
which we have never supported in any way. Under
the circumstances we thought it no more than fair
that Mr. Webb should be permitted to tell his story,
especially since the Los Angeles papers were all
prejudiced against him. The Call did for him what
it would be ashamed to refuse a dog â namely, gave
him a chance to defend himself from the assaults of
his enemies.
It is not difficult to understand the motives which
inspire newspapers to conduct themselves as those
at Los Angeles are being conducted in this case. The
spirit of unfairness manifested is the source of much
of the contempt that is everywhere in the country
taking the place of the respect which has heretofore
been entertained by the people for a fair and honest
press. But the attitude of the League for Better
Government is inexplicable. The name of this or
ganization imports honesty and truthfulness. Yet it
has adopted a resolution concerning this journal
which contains two falsehoods and several lines of
abuse utterly out of place in such a body.
We are sorry for the League for Better Govern
ment of Los Angeles. When it becomes necessary
for an organization with such a name to denounce
a newspaper for publishing the plain truth it is time
to wonder what it was begun for and why it exists.
The League for Better Government, however, may
safely be left to work out its own destiny. Public
opinion in the Orange City will doubtless finally
make a proper disposition of it. In the meantime we
may say that The Call will continue to publish the
truth about the Los Angeles school scandal, as we'll
as all other scandals, without fear or favor.
OPEN THE SENATE DOORS.
THE annexation debate has opened. In defer
ence to the customs of the Senate all business
transacted by that body in pursuance of its joint
functions with the President is in secret. In the
confirmation of Presidential appointments and the
consideration of treaties the Senate becomes part of
the executive branch of the Government. Hence
these secret sessions are called "executive."
There is no constitutional provision requiring that
they be secret. While the propriety of confidential
and secret consideration of much of the business be
fore the Senate as part of the executive may well be
conceded, it must also be admitted that in a matter
such as the annexation of a far country like Hawaii
an open session would be more satisfactory to the
people. It reverses our national policy by a most
violent wrench and changes our relations to the rest
of the world. At the same time it gravely affects our
domestic policy. Annexationists frankly admit that
the peculiar physical condition? of Hawaii will make
it necessary to set up special statutes for that country
which shall not apply to the rest of the republic. The
sober mind of the country has not been convinced
of the necessity nor of the propriety of annexation
by any of the public arguments made in its favor,
neither in the treaty itself, the communication of Sec
retary Sherman nor the message of the President.
Indeed, to piece out this lack of reasons that will
convince the best public opinion of the country it has
been given out that other weighty and dominating
reasons will be revealed to the Senate in executive
session. Therefore these reasons can never reach the
people, as the records of the session are secret en
tirely.
Such treatment of such an issue is in itself evidence
of an element in the act proposed that is full of dan
ger to the future of the country. The secret acquisi
tion of distant territory that cannot become a State
in the Union, that would be undesirable if it were
a State, that cannot be clothed with a government in
form resembling that heretofore provided for our ter
ritories during their novitiate for statehood, is a pro
ceeding inimical to free government. It is accom
panied by public admission that it makes necessary
the destruction of the equality of our laws. It is
against the protest of a vast majority of the people to
be governed by a system that no annexationist ven
tures to further forecast than by the admission that
it will not resemble any form provided by the consti
tution. Moreover, whether constitutional or not, it
will be without the consent of 95 per cent of the peo
ple to be governed, and will therefore contravene the
declaration that all governments derive their just
powers from the consent of the governed, which is
the moral marrow in our national bones, the very
blood of our national life, which has secured for us
the respect of mankind. That kind of respect is of
higher moral and material value to us than the sort
of respect that is forced by a frowning exhibition of
pewer.
Yet the foremost plea made for annexation is that
we must throw away the respect born of confidence
and esteem that we may gain that which is born of
fear and terror. When we do this we abandon a
position which we occupy alone among the nations.
We descend from an eminence of which we are the
sole tenant and -join the countries which get the in
spiration of their policy from the maxim that might
makes right. Following this inspiration the history
of their dealings with the weak is written in blood
and tear?. Ours, inspired by the maxim that right
makes might, is written in letters of light which the
oppressed and the weak have seen and reioicel.
If we are to eclipse the bright legend which has
made the weak feel that in all the hard world they
had ouc friend iv the great republic, the reasons
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 13, IS9B.
should all be entered in the public records, that here
after all men may know why it was done. It a rea
son can be given for destroying the autonomy of
Hawaii by the same Senators who go to the insult
ing verge of war with Spain because she refuses
autonomy to Cuba, and who protest against the
European nations destroying the autonomy of China,
it should be publicly given.
If we are to abandon the philosophy of the rights
of man and put off the robes of the righteous in ex
change for the weapons of the tyrant and the
butcher, please let us know why.
' I 'HE contest over the Ohio senatorship has
I ended satisfactorily in the election of Senator
Hanna. That, however, is the only feature
of the election that can be regarded with satisfac
tion or even with toleration. From start to finish the
fight made against Mr. Hanna was spiteful, vicious
and mean. It was conducted with the vilest weapons
known to our politics and constitutes a serious dis
grace to the commonwealth in which it. occurred.
For a week past charges and counter charges of
bribery have been freely made on both sides. Well
known men stand forth as sponsors for these charges.
The accusations have been made specifically and in
detail. The names of the persons offering the
bribes have been given and the amounts stated.
Every particle of evidence required for an investiga
tion has been made public. Clearly, therefore, there
has been bribery or perjury among the noted politi
cians of one side or the other, and in either case the
reputation of the State will suffer unless the guilty
parties are determined and promptly punished.
That the ballot was taken while these charges were
in the air and uninvestigated is an evidence that the
legislators cared little about them. They seem
to have been looked upon as mere campaign lies to
be passed over as matters of no moment. That fact
in itself shows a low standard of public morality. If
the charges made were unworthy of notice â mean
lies best treated with silent contempt â then certainly
the men who made them must be unworthy to repre
sent any constituency.
The public will be slow to believe any of the
charges of bribery brought against Senator Hanna
or his friends. There was no reason why he or they
should have resorted to the use of money to procure
his election. He was the choice of his party
for the senatorship, and was indorsed for
the office by the State convention of the
party as well as by most of the county
conventions. His candidacy formed the chief issue
of the campaign. The people supported him and
elected to the Legislature a majority pledged to vote
tor him. Some of the men expressly pledged to him
broke their promises and opposed him. Under such
circumstances why should he resort to dishonest
practices to win? His case was one that appealed to
honor and fidelity. He was the choice of the people.
His canvass had been open, straightforward and hon
orable. A candidate under such circumstances does
not become suddenly a briber and a criminal.
Wherever the guilt may be, however, it should be
hunted out So explicit have been the charges that
no excuse can be made for a neglect to prosecute.
Senator Hanna goes to the Senate with clean hands,
but his friends in Ohio owe it to him and to their
State to pursue the investigation unrelentingly until
the last liar, bribe taker or bribe giver is exposed and
driven from public lite.
A SERIES of papers recently published in The
Call directed attention to the need of a greater
diffusion of standard books among the people
of California and pointed out as one of the best
means of supplying the need the establishment of
traveling libraries upon a plan similar to that adopted
in other States of the Union.
The proposal is not new to those who have inter
ested themselves in the promotion of public libraries
and augmenting the opportunities for intellectual
culture. Some time ago the Library Association of
Central California adopted resolutions declaring that
traveling libraries are essential to the diffusion of
knowledge throughout the State and pledging sup
port to the establishment of such a system.
The proposal, therefore, has good indorsement as
well as good reasons to support it. It is one that
well deserves consideration in all parts of the State.
It should not be permitted to pass unnoted in the
rush of general affairs. The establishment of such a
system will require legislative action, and in order
that such action may be assured at the next meeting
of the Legislature a campaign of popular education
on the subject should begin at once.
The issue is one in which we invite the co-opera
tion of the interior press. The smaller towns and
more sparsely settled counties where library facilities
are scant, or altogether lacking, have a special in
terest in the movement to establish the proposed trav
eling library system. To them it would be a clear
gain in every respect and would lead to the forma
tion of permanent libraries in many communities
where under existing circumstances the creation of
such institutions is regarded as among the things re
mote and improbable.
The plan of the proposed system is simple. The
State is to provide a number of "traveling libraries"
containing from fifty to one hundred volumes each.
These are to be carefully boxed and made ready for
shipment to any part of the State where "a library
association" is prepared to receive them, pay the
freight, circulate them and guarantee their safe return
to the State authorities.
The system has been adopted and operated with
conspicuous success in several of the more progres
sive States in the East. In New York upward of one
hundred of these libraries, carefully selected and un
der the control of the University of New York, are
now traveling from one locality to another. In
Wisconsin the success achieved has been so great
that men of wealth have become interested in the
movement and have made rich donations to pro
mote it.
California possesses one of the finest State libra
ries in the Union. It is. however, of comparatively
little use to the people, because the books are kept
at Sacramento and are not to be read except by resi
dents or visitors to that city. The traveling system
would enable the people in all sections of the State
to enjoy the benefits of the library they are taxed to
maintain. It would place at the disposal of even the
smallest community a large number of standard
books at no greater cost than that of paying the
freight, and as the libraries would circulate from
community to community that would be small.
The advantages to be gained are certainly great.
The movement now begun should be supported with
such force in every county as to assure the estab
lishment of the system when the Legislature meets.
The lowa is reckoned as among the prides of the
navy. and since she has survived the recoil of her own
guns at target practice, being merely laid up for re
pairs, dearly deserves her reputation.

Willie Collier, the conudian who Is rmw
playing s.> successfully an engagement
at the Baldwin Theater, and thereby
hangs a talc. As the story goes, the
original production <>f "The Man From
Mexico*' was made at Hoyt's Theater,
New York City. Up on Broadway at
the Bijou "Courted Into Court" was
being exploited by Rich & Harris' com
pany of farceurs, headed by Comedian
John < '. Rice. Rice and Collier are warm
friend* and Willie conceived the Idea of
perpetrating one of his practical Jokes
on his friend John C.
After the second act of "The Man
From Ifextao" Mr. Collier jumped Into
â  (ah with his famous prison suit of
stripes and funny make-up and was
whirled rapidly to the stage door of the
Bijou Theater and making his way
through the subterranean passageway
Which a.ir.iHs thespians to that play
house by the way of Sixth avenue, he
suddenly appeared upon the stage from
the prompt side in the first entrance
just at the supper scene, which consti
tutes one of the Important events In the
â econd act In "Courted Into Court." and
walked rapidly up to Rice grasped that
comedian by the hand and said: "John,
old man. you're the best that ever came
out of the bunch and I am glad to see
you. '
The appearance of Collier in stripes, it
Is needless to remark, created a deckled
sensation. Neither the audience in front
nor the actors on the stage knew what to
make of it, and the expression on John
EUce'a face is said to have been a study.
Collier's exit was as quick as his en
trance, however, but not so successful
in view of the fact as he emerged from
the stage door chuckling over his clever
ruse and started to re-enter his cab a
bluecoat minion of the law. who had
been watching his movements, laid a
vise-like (rasp upon his arm and said,
"I^t's go back to Blackwell's."
The consternation of Collier can be bet
ter Imagined than described, inasmuch
as that comedian had another act to pta>
f'.r his nwu audience at Hbyfs, and It
took the combined efforts of Frank Mc-
Kee. Harry B. Harris and Playwright
Charles H. Hoyt to convince the sleuth
that Collier was only masquerading as
a convict and was not a real felon.

turesque valley of Helene, near a rock
which overhangs the river Schwechat,
close to the Antoine grotto. The path
leading to the grotto has remained a fa
vorite walk with the numerous bathers
whom the sulphurous waters of Baden
ami the beautiful scenery around the city
still attract there. The monument will
consist of a marble plaque ornamented
with a bronze portrait of Beethoven; it
will bo embedded in the rock. It is hoped
the monument will be finished this spring.
Beethoven possesses already several pom
pous monuments in Europe, in America,
and. If we are not mistaken, even in Aus
tralia; but not one of them can boast of
po romantic a situation as that on the
rock of Helene, which the grand artist
so often contemplated when the soft mur
murs of the little Alpine river flowing
rapidly in its narrow bed were, alas, no
longer perceptible to the ear of the great
master of music.
The Llederkranz Orpheon of Manheim
lately gave a concert in the only hall the
city possessed for that purpose. And as
this hall had already been let for the pur
pose of exhibiting the valiant deeds of a
lion tamer in a cage ornamented with six
lions, the Orpheon had to resign Itself to
singing in the presence of these formid
able brutes hidden, it is true, behind the
scenes. The lions, which, as is well
known, are great lovers of music, con
ducted themselves admirably, and the
public never suspected their presence, but
after a sentimental duet between the ten
or and soprano an old lioness could not
prevent herself from expressing her sat
isfaction by a formidable roaring, which
might have been taken for an enthusias
tic encore. There was some difficulty in
tranquilizing the audience.
About two years ago the tenor, M.
Broulik, brought an action against the
manager of the Budapest Opera-house,
which has been frequently spoken of in
the papers. After having lost his case in
two instances the artist carried it before
the Court of Cassation, which ordered a
new trial. Now the tribunal in the first
instance after having again heard this
cause gave a verdict in favor of the ar
tist to the amount of 25,000 francs with
the costs of the other trials, which
amounted to a pretty large sum. Tho
representation of "Rhine Gold," in which
the singer had refused to take part, after
having already sung in three other "Wag
nerian operas during the week, will have
cost the Budapest Opera house an ap
preciable quantity of Danube gold.
The year 1807, which began so badly in
Chicago, was true to itself and ended
badly. First Rosenthnl's unfortunate ill
ness, which t..rew a gloom over the be
ginning of the season, then the disaffec
tion of various former members of the
Qr&U Company threatened that organiza
tion with collapse. Nothing "drew" in
large numbers and only private enterprise
prevented the year from being not only
a financial, but an artistic failure. And
lastly, the inimitable Semhrich, who had
been announced to close the musical sea
son of ISJ*7 and open that of 1888, ;. 1. â -
graphed her regrets that illness prevented
her coming. A magnificent house was as
sured and hosts of warm admirers
awaited her, but the week closed and no
hopes were held out of her being able to
visit Chicago.
The Carl Theater of Vienna celebrated

The opera at Vienna is preparing for
the benefit of its retired members a rep
resentation of "La Tsigane." by Johann
Strauss, wblcb will bo truly original anÂ«l
very attractive. In the ball scene of the
second act all the retired members of the
theater will figure among the invited
guests. They will also take part in a
grand ch.-rus which terminates the net.
There will be seen Mme. Materna, as the
Valkyrie; Mm.. Papier, as Orpheus; Mmc

the scene of their ancient triumphs. Jo

director, will take the baton.
Apropos of the revival of Bizet's "Pearl
Fishers," which has just taken place at
the Theatre Lyrique, Milan, the "Trova
tore" makes this reflection: The artistic
ensemble suffices to show that we are
quite international. What more could you
wish? La Pinkert represents Poland, the
tenor Bayo. Spain, the barytone Bouvet,
France, and the bass Brancanleoni, Italy.
Let us add that the success of M. Bou
vet, who made his debut in Italy on this
occasion, was complete.
The 30th of November, at the Theater
Royal, Madrid, "Hero and Leander," a
lyric tragedy in three acts and a pro
logue poem by M. Arrigo Boito, music by
ML LuiKi Mar.cinolli, was given for tho
nrst time in Italian. This work was writ
ton expressly for the Norwich Festival
and was performed there last year,
had a brilliant success at Madrid, where
the two roles of Hero and Leander were
taken by the tenor De Marchl and Mme.
Darclee.
An Interesting concert -was given last
week in London under the patronage of
Mrs. John Hay, wife of the American
Embassador. The principal attractions
were Ethel and Alice Dovey from Ne
braska, two sisters, aged fourteen and
sixteen. They Fang Blumenthal's "Vene
tian Boat Song," giving evidence of pos
sessing much musical talent, and other
songs. There were many performers and
an interesting feature of the programme
was the recitation by Mrs. Colbrooke of
John Hay's "Enchanted Shirt."
BC Siegfried "Wagner, who has been re
siding for some months in Rome, has just
left the Eternal City, carrying in his va
lise two acts of an opera comique which
he hopes soon to finish. The subject is
taken from an incident of the thirty
year war. This opera will probably have
its first performance at Munich during
the autumn.
The latest recipients of the much-cov
eted jubilee medal are Mile. Chaminade
and Eduard Grieg. Both artists have re
cently played before Her Majesty at
Windsor, and in the latter case, Mm<\
Grieg sang several of her husband's songa
âamong these the ever-popular "Ich
Liebe Dich." Grieg also played his "Hu
moreske."
On Christmas day Mme. Patti sang in
Albert Hall, London, and was greeted by
an immense audience, as usual. Many
encores were insisted on, which she gave
in the old way, the first song being "Bel
Raggio," with "Voiche Sapete" for an en
core. "Kathleen Mavourneen" was fol
lowed by "Home, Sweet Home." She was
assisted by Miss Clara Butt, George Fer
gupson, Mme. Burmeister-Petersen, etc.
Mme. Nordiea has contributed an arti
cle to the "Golden Penny," entitled "Ad
vice to Young Singers." It contains some
excellent hints, and as it is written by a
singer of great experience and success, it
should be valuable to all aspiring vocal
ists.
At the first meeting of the general com

PLAYED AWAY HIS PASSAGE MONEY.
Peter Piers was on his way to the Klondike, hut ho paused on his journey
there at San Francisro, and while waiting for the first hoat to the land of gold
and Icebergs he spent a good deal of his time and all of his money at the race
track. As a consequence ha shot himself, and is now at the City and County
Hospital with a bullet In hii bead.
Piers lived in a little room at 801 Pine street, and it was there, at 4 o'clock
yesterday morning, he tried to take bis life. He was- not discovered until later
in the morning, and thr-n he was taken to the Receiving Hospital.
He says he is from Cologne, and that he is a miner and a wine and brandy
agent, and that he cane from Australia to get to Klondike. He did not know
ould have to wait so long, .so be fame in the middle of winter to reach
there early in spring. He Is not â  racing man and he knows nothing of the
horses out here, but he thought a little flyer would not hurt his pocket and so
he played, not wisely but tOO well. Tuesday lie lost the last of $3000 he had with
him when he landed seven weeks ago, and the toss and the blighted prospects
of Klondike and'his friendless position so preyed upon his mind that he took
the revolver he had purchased for much different purposes and shot himself in
the temple. A? he lies on a cot In the cheerless hospital ward he is growing
sorry that he tried to leave the world. "I have seen a good de.-il of it," lie says,
In explanation of his change of heart, but he fears the Klondike trip must be
postponed indefinitely, for he thinks a man with no money cannot do much
here.
The extent of the man's injuries cannot be determined Just yet, but It is
thought he has not been badly hurt unless the bullet has entered the brain.
Whether It htts or has not will be learned to-day.

locked in. after being released.
The Lull was one of a herd that was
being driven to Hutchertown. When
opposite the Folsom -street steps the

and ran overboard. Half a dozen 1d..-it
men in Whitehall*, with the assistance

Harry Johnson and Dave Jenkins re

about 100 yards of heaving line t.> its
neck. After setting the animal on Its

quite a while. When it did move it

Dillon was not so fortunate. The ani

and Dillon managed to make his ts

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.-To-day's market for
securities was much of the BamÂ« character as
yesterday's. The principal Interest Â»a? cen
tered .in Union Pacific and a number of Its
affiliated companies and in Northern Pacific.
which were the leading factors of (strength,
while on the other hand Sugar continued under
a weight of depression, as was the case yes
terday. A new feature of. special strength was
Chesapeake and Ohio, which advanced a point
on heavy buying. Transactions were on a very
large scale, and the heavy dealings of large
operators, backed by the powerful interests,
were manifest all through the market. These
large operations attracted a considerable fol
lowing both among the smaller traders and
from outside sources. Commission house busi
ness was, in fact, quite noticeable in the day's
trading. It was obvious, however, that realiz
ing on a large scale was going on in different
parts of the list colncidentally with the
strength In other parts. A striking example of
this process was seen In the two Northern Pa
cific stocks, the common being advanced over a
point, while realizing, in the specified carried
It before the close below last night's last sale
The grangers, outside of St. Paul, will also
be seen to reflect a supply of stock fully equal
to the demand. Union Pacific rose at one time
over two points, but recent buyers commenced
to profit as soon as a report was published
that the new company had secured control of
the Oregon Short Line. The stock reacted
over a point. The recent strength of the stocks
o the disintegrated portions of the old Union
Pacific system is fully explained by to-day's
announcement. This buying wan evidently
founded on a belief In far-reaching plans of
combination and extension, which, according to
some prevalent rumors will embrace one vast
system from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Much
â was made In the market on a reported bond
laaue by the Chesapeake and Ohio, though
the view of benefits to accrue seemed to be
somewhat exaggerated regarding the amount
of transactions.
Advices from the London and continental
markets showed the tone of American securi
ties In the foreign financial markets to be ex
cellent. London bought in this market no less
than 20,000 shares of the favorite international
storks, and the marked strength of Union Pa
cific. Denver and Rio Srande preferred and
Northern Pacific were directly attributable to
this demand. The weakness In Sugar seemed to
he connected with the annual meeting of di
rectors in progress to-day, though no news re
garding the company reached the house. Money
declined to yield to-day below 24 per cent,
but the tone of the market reflected the preva
lent feeling that rates will yield in the near
future. Large amounts of money also found
their way Into investment and speculation to
day. The available possibility of relief to the
money market was Indicated by the fall of He
In posted rates, the decline not being pre
vented by the expected arrival to-morrow at
Pan Francisco of another $1,000,000 In gold
from Australia. The par value of to-day's
transactions In bonds Is not as large as that
o? yesterday, but business was remarkably
well distributed all through the list. Gains
were the rule, but there were some declines
Total sales. $4,775,000. United States old 4s

There was a sale of the new 4s coupon at

LONDON MARKET.
N*EW TORK, Jan. 12â The Evenln* Post's
London financial cablegram t>ays: There was
less activity in Grand Trunks and Canadian
Pacifies In the stock market here to-day, and
increased animation and strength In Ameri
cans and Argentines, particularly Argentine
rails. Mines were neglected.
Americans are still mainly supported by New
York and the continent. There were Increased
dealings here, but entirely by professional
speculators. Denver and Rio Grande preferred
has risen sharply on professional clique buy
ing. Union Pacifies were strong on buying
from New York and the continent. Prices
generally closed strong. It Is reported, but I
cannot In any way confirm it. that the pur
chaser of Manitoba and Western bonds Is the
Northern Pacific Company.
Gold is In increased demand for Germany.
It Is nominally quoted at 77s 104 d, but it Is
really much higher.
You may entirely discredit the rumors of
Anglo-German China loans. The negotiations,
whether completed or not, are on the lines
already cabled.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Jan. 12-At the opening option
prices for wheat showed a slight decline. May
starting at '.<n\i&9o' : n c as compared with yes
terday's close of Sic. This was because Liv
erpool showed a very small advance In re
sponse to the gain here yesterday and Paris
ppened lower. Northwest receipts were again
THE SAX FBAyCTSCO CALL, THXJKSDAT, JAXTJARY 13, 1898.
too heavy to be a comfort to the hulls, and
smaller receipts here were the only circum
stance" that they could claim in their favor.
Trading was restricted by the general bear
tsnnesa of the speculative crowd, which pre
vented them from buying, and their timidity
at the same time of being caught short under
the well-known threatening local conditions
that now exist. For a fhort time after the
opening the market did show nome strength.
Brokers for the Leiter interests were fair buy
ers at â¢ â â "Â«' . and th'Mr example in this rt-spect
was followed by MM of the small fry. the
price as a result advancing to 91V- Rumors
that the French duty on grain was about to
be reduced were persistently circulated at the
opening and helped In the advance. Denials
soon became so unanimous, however, that the
crowd dropped the tariff reduction as mo
tive for the decline at Paris, and the market
here eased off from that time.
The receipts at Western primary markets
were 420.000 bushels, against 230.000 bushels the
corresponding day of the year before. Liver
pool's advance was only 'id .per cental and
Paris opened from E centimes to 15 centimes
lower. Iteerbohm cabled that Argentine wheat
sold at 33s M. or the equivalent of $1 OOH. and
that cargoes of that wheat were being freely
offered to arrive. On the other hand, the
Minneapolis dispatches reiterated their con
stant theme of coming scarcity In that re
gion.
The export clearances of wheat and flour
from the Atlantic ports amounted to 445,000
bushels. Closing cables brought lower quota
tions from Continental markets, while Liver
pool closed about "-id lower for next crop fu
tures. September showing "-id advance. Paris
quoted flour for this months delivery 45 cen
times lower, and for March-May 15 centimes
higher. Wheat 5 centimes lower for both Im
mediate and remote deliveries; Antwerp. 15
centimes lower for American red and 12*4 cen
times lower for Walla Walla.
The price of May fluctuated between 90*Ae
and 91c for the greater part of the session and
at 1 o'clock was selling at 90% c. In the last
fifteen minutes of the session support had en
tirely disappeared and operators who had be
come "long" on the. early French rumors had
considerable difficulty In unloading. May de
clined rapidly In consequence and was quoted
at 90%5T904c at the close.
Corn was very quiet. The market was easy
at the opening with wheat. It turned firm on
the prospects of a cold wave, but turned easy
again as wheat declined, and showed weak
ness for the rest of the session.
The market for oats was slow. Borne firm
ness was shown at the opening, but later
prices fell off with wheat and corn.
Provisions were strong throughout. , Much
lighter receipts of hogs than expected started
the market at small advances all around.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
POSTON. Jan. 12.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter -will say to-morrow. The
sales thin week have fallen off nearly fi7 per
cent from the previous week. Notwithstand
ing this fact the market Is possessed of more
interesting: features now than then.
Th.ugh much less active, it is a broader
market. Where a short time since a half
dozen gigantic mills were absorbing all atten
tion by reason of their eagernf-ss to pick up
round t* staple i-rritory, there l*
now a *videsr.read Inquiry from mills or every
class for wool of a great man- different grades
and better Inquiry is highly Indicative of an
active market in a very short time.
Territory wools, especially those having sta
ple in them, have been Inquired for, as have
certain lines of fleece, pulled wools and greasy
capes.
Prices are ful.y â¢- firm as a week ago and
in some cases are more so, notably In Delaine
wools.
A large business Is anticipated by everybody
within a few weeks, and there is consequently
every Inducement to keep quotations at a
high flirure. The sales of the weÂ»k amount to
Z.tM.'fiO pounds domestic and 1 n"2.<v>o pounds
frrÂ»lgn. as against a total of 7,650.000 for the
j.revlous week.

illllliiliiliGEMS OF A
DEAD GIRL
Her Slayer, Lover and
Family Claim
Them.
Aftermath of the Tragedy at
Professor Mooar's
House.
The Llttic Diamonds Led to Murder an
cbe Dispute Is Not
Ended.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Jan. 12.
There â will bo a bitter struggle over
the diamond? that figured in the trial
i f Louis Muhlner for the murder of
Jennie Miller three years ago.
The diamond studs that are in dis
pute were In a large degree responsible
for the tragedy and since the convic
tion and sentence of Muhlner they
have been in the custody of the Dis
trict Attorney. To-day that officer
asked ilv court to make an order au
thorizing the clerk to return the dia
monds t<< their owner. Judge Ells
worth decided that to do so would
place too much responsibility on the
clerk, and thÂ« matter is now under ad
visement.
The diamonds are claimed by tho rel
atives of the dead girl, by the tempo
rary lover. Charles Miller, and also by
Muhiner. who Is now in San Quentin.
The gems were undoubtedly given by
Muhlner to his sweetheart, Jennie
Lewis. Some time later Muhlner saw
hia presents adorning the finger and
shirt bosom of his rival, Charlie Mil
ler. This aroused his anger, and he
quarreled with him.
Jennie Lewis told Muhlner she had
merely loaned the gems to Miller, but
Miller said that the girl had given
them to him outright. Muhlner asked
an explanation, and when he saw that
his sweetheart was false to him he
planned on revenge. He bought a re
volver and shot the girl on the porch
of Rev. Dr. Mooar's house in North
Oakland.
At tho trial the diamonds were much
in evidence, and since it closed there
has been a conflict as to ownership.
Recently the girl's relatives asked for
them, but as Miller had applied for
them, and the murderer also believes
he has some title to them. District At
torney Snook is anxious to be relieved
of their custody and the responsibility
now rests with the court.
BRITTON NAMES

An Uninteresting Meeting of
the New Charter
Framers.
The Work of Outlining Proposed j
Organic Laws Postponed for
Several Weeks.
The Freeholders who are to frame
new organic laws for the government
of the municipality met again last
nierht, but transacted little business.
The members were in argumentative
mood. The simplest motion was pro
vocative of long and tiresome debate
and when finally an adjournment was
taken a sigh of relief went up, not
only from the charter framers them
selves, but also from the few specta
tors who visited the assembly room
in the Mills building in the expecta
tion of hearing something of Interest.
After calling the meeting to order
Chairman Britten announced that he
had appointed the following sub-com
mittees in compliance with the reso
lution adopted at the meeting held on

FROM STOCKTON
DOWN TO OAKLAND
The Railroad Commissioners
Commend the Valley Road
in Their Report.
The New LinÂ« Will Do Much to
Settle the Question of-
Rates.
The regular meeting of the Railroad
Commissioners took plac* yesterday in
the rooms of the Commission in the
Chronicle building. The only matter
of any importance that was considered
â¢was the annual report of the Commis
" sion for the year ending November 30, I
1897.
The report was a general resume of
the business handled by the Commis
sion during the past year, and though
Most Complexion Powders
have a vulgar glare, but Pozzoni's is a truat
beautificr , whose effects are lasting. |
it does not discuss any matter in all
its details, yet it touches on several
subjects of local interest.
It expresses regret that the matter
of reducing the rates on grain 8 per
cent, which was taJten into the Circuit
Court by the Southern Pacific Com
pany, has not yet been settled by that
body, though every effort has been
made by the Commission to bring it
to a speedy conclusion.
The commission also urges the ne
cessity of some legislation which will
allow it more latitude in the manage
ment of the affairs intrusted to its
care, as it complains of being so re
stricted to the local courts that most
of its operations are rendered utterly
worthless.
After reviewing the different com
plaints that have come before it and
calling attention to the extensions
made in construction on different
roads, the commission says: "The Han
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railway Company has extended its
lines through the San Joaquin Valley
to Bakersfield, and at the present time
has its engineers surveying a line from
Stockton to Oakland, which, when
completed, will be of great benefit to
the shippers and growers on the line
of said road, and will in a great meas
ure regulate the question of fixing
fares and freight rates.

The monthly meeting of the San Fran-
THE WEST OAKLAND MARSH.
Resolved. That the West Oakland Improvement Club hereby expresses Its
sincere approval and appreciation of the sentiments set forth by the San Francisco
Call in the editorial beaded "Why Improvements Lag," and which appeared in its
issue of Saturday. January S.
In particular does the West Oakland Improvement Club , appreciate and ap
prove of the broad-minded and wise opinions expressed In said 'editorial concerning?
the beautifying of the West Oakland reclaimed marsh lands, which read as
follows:
"We hope that there Is enough official courage .md civic spirit left In Oakland
to proceed with the project to improve the approaches to the city by the redemp
tion of the nasty marshes near Sixteenth-street station, which in an important
tense are an injury to the whole Ptate, since they must be traversed by the hun
dreds of thousands who come to and go from San Francisco every year!"
Tho above-referred -to editorial the West Oakland Improvement Club com
mends to the careful consideration of ail progressive citizens of Oakland and of
the members of the Oakland City Council.
The above resolution was adopted by the West Oakland Improvement Club

NEW HONORS TO
FATHER YORKE
He Is Presented With a Testi
monial and a
Purse.
The Resolutions Testify the Appreci
ation of His Assistants for His
Good Work.
A very pleasant surprise was tenur
ed the Rev. P. C. Yorke yesterday aft
ernoon when he was presented with a
handsomely engrossed set of resolu
tions and a purse of $800 by the Catho
lic pastors of the archdiocese of San
Francisco.
Father Yorke was given notice that
a meeting was to be held in St. Charles'
Hall, at Eighteenth and Shotwell
streets, at 3:30 p. m., and his attend
ance was requested, but he was given
no intimation of the real object of the
meeting. When the Rev. Father Glea
son stepped forward and made a neat
speech complimenting Father Yorke on
his vigorous fight against the American
Protective Association and presented
him with the two tokens of esteem, the
popular priest was for perhaps the
first time in his life rendered almost
speechless. He soon recovered himself,
however, and made an eloquent re
sponse to the good wishes of his fellow
wi.Tkers.
The resolutions were engrossed by
Carl Elsenchimel, and are beautifully
illuminated with capital letters and
handsome border. They congratulate
the pÂ»riest in unstinted terms for the
battle he fought single-handed against
the enemies of the Catholic Church.
They were signed by Rev. Fathers J.
Melvin, president, and Joseph M. Glea
son, M. P. Ryan and John A. Cull,
members of the committee who had
charge of the affair.
Among the priests who gathered to
do honor to Father Yorke were: Revs.

APPROVE THE
CALL'S VIEW
West Oakland Citizens
Are in Favor of
Progress.
Practical Advice Will Help to
Open People's
Eyes.
â \
Before Long the Marsh Will Have a
Place Only in tho
Memory.
I Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 12.
For many years the "West Oakland
residents have complained about the
nuisance that was permanently with
them because of the marsh on that Bide
of town.
Not until the formation of the West
Oakland Improvement Club was any
thing of a practical nature undertaken,
but during the past two years a vast
improvement has taken place and now
there is much hope that the perma
nent result will be the obliteration of
the marsh and the creation thereon of
beautiful parks. A large portion of
this work has been already underta
ken and much more is under contem
plation.
At last night's meeting of the club
the following resolution was unani
mously passed:
CLEVELAND ASKS
FOR CLEMENCY
Pleads With the Governor for
the Life of Train-Wrecker
Worden.
The Chief Executive in Receipt of a
Written Communi
cation.
Strenuous efforts are being made to
save the life of Salter B. Worden, the
train wrecke-r, who has been sentenced
to die on the scaffold next Friday
morning. His aged mother and rela
tives, who are heart-broken over his
impending doom, have sent petitions
to Governor Budd for executive clem
ency; but placing very little hope in the
effectiveness *.f their own intercession
they have communicated with promin
ent men all over the country to inter
cede in Worden's behalf
The latest communication of this
kind was received by Governor Budd
yesterday afternoon and from ex-Presi
dent Grover Cleveland. It reads as fol
lows:
. Princeton. N. J., January
|â His Excellency, Jnmes H. Uudd-Dear
in ordinary circumstances I would
hrs,t;,te long if r did not decline to make
an appeal to your executive elemenev
There are circumstances drawing out of
! the case of Saltt-r I>. Wor.L-n. now under
ncÂ« of death In your State, which
con-trnined me to ask you to extend to
; him such a m< asure. of mercy as will pre
vent his execution.
I do not feel that T ought to presume to
influence your judgment In considering
i whether or not in the facts and law in-
I volved in his case there is a condition pre
sented amply justifying your interfer
ence.
. I do say, however, without the least
reservation and from personal knowledge
that the statements which 1 have seen
and which I understand have been pre
sented to you showing that Worden'n
mental construction made him peculiarly
susceptible to excited conditions are made
by persons of such high character and
probity as absolutely guarantee the truth
and sincerity of such statements.
I hope I need not say that I should not
have written tnis mlsslvo if I was not en
tirely gatisfled In my own mind that
clemency would not be only Justified, but
would be a deed of charity and mercy to
an aged and sorrowing mother and criev-
Ing relatives. Yours very truly,
OROVKR CLEVELAND.

DR. V. CONDOR Y, Who Gives a Meal in a Nutshell.
Dr. V. Condory, who has an office at 959 Howard street, says miners
hound for the Klondike need have no trouble about getting a sufficient
supply of food into that inhospltahlo region. Ho claims to have perfected
a way of condensing foods so that only four grains of his preparation is
necessary for a good hearty meal. Those four grains of prepared food, ha
says, contain as much nutriment as a pound of the best beef that ever
came into the markets of this city.
Pr. Condory came to San Francisco only a short time ago from Hot
Fprings. Ark., where he practiced medicine for about ten years. Dr.
Condory says he commenced experiment ing with the condensation of foods
many yean .'!Â£", and the first practical tests of his researches were made
In Gibraltar on a number of the soldiers stationed at the barracks there.
They wnre Riven only the condensed foods and eight grains served as a
meaL They wore given hard manual labor tr> perform, and for fifteen days
that the experiments wore conducted the men never complained of fatigue
and they were an strong and healthy as when they first commenced.
The condensed food is in the shape of a brown powder and It is placed
In 4-Rrain gelatine capsules. Two of the capsules make a meal, and a man
could tarry enough food in his coat pocket to last several months. Dr.
Condory has issued invitations to physicians to experiment with his prepa
ration of condensed food.

POLLY WANTS
HER DIAMONDS
James E. Nolan's Ex-Wife Is
Aggrieved at "Rudy"
Fishbeck.
Ho Pawned Her Gams and Now She
Is Anxious to Recover
Them.
Pretty Polly Foster, whose matri
monial difficulties with James E. No
lan â one of the shoe Nolans â was the
talk of the town about a year ago. Is
to the front again with a new trouble.
This time it is her diamondsâ not her
husbandâ that are causing the disturb
ance. Mrs. Nolan is the adopted daugh
ter of Captain Mnterson, by whom she
was raised. Her marriage to Nolan OH
December 26, 1*95, made a sensation
at the time, as she did not consult her
foeter parents any more than did No
lan his relatives.
The divorce courts separated the
pair, Mrs. Nolan gaining her liberty on
the ground of cruelty.
Some fcime later she made the ac
quaintance of "Rudy" Fishbeek. a well
groomed young man, who manages a
saloon on Market street, and was fre
quently seen in his company. Tiy some
meana he obtained possession of a
handsome diamond ring and a pair of
diamond earrings owned by Mrs. No
lan and hypothecated them to a pawn
broker at an exorbitant rate of inter
est.
Mrs. Nolan pnys he took the dia
monds on the pretense that he wished
to wear the ring uikl have the earrings
reset, while Fishbeck contends that it
was understood that he was to pawn
the stones and that the proceeds were
to be considered as a loan.
At any rate Mrs. Nolan Is very much
worried over the fate of her gems, and
has been in consultation with members
Of the Police Department, as well as
friend* among the judicial lights <>f thÂ»-
City Hall. She is undecided whether to
sue Fishbeck for the return of the dia
monds or have him arrested for em
bezzlement.

RESENT CRESSY'S
STATEMENTS
The Ex-Pastor of Emmanuel
Church Was Too Out
spoken.
His Words Attributed to Some Bitter
ness Which Arose Over His
Resignation.
The letter of the Rev. Frank Cressy,
sent from Boston and published In
The Call of Thursday morning, has
aroused a feeling of resentment among
the members and officers of the Em
manuel Baptist Church. They consider
that his statements are uncalled for
nnd are the outgrowth of bitterness
against the church more than a desire
to have the truth made known.
His statements regarding the pastor
are held to be particularly objection
able. In his letter he referred to the
statements made by Mr. Gibson to the
attorneys for the defense, and charac
terized them as being most peculiar,
and leading to the Inference that Mr.
Gibson was more closely connected
with the church murders than any
supposed.
The oflicers of the church had hoppd
| that the whole unfortunate business
! had ended, but they are not prepared
to let it end with any slurs upon their
pastor, and they have been expressing
th.ir opinions freely.
Mr. CreMQT has never been very
; friendly to the church, say the trus
tees, since his resignation from the
pastorate four years ago. Mr. Cressy
had been attending to the spiritual
\s;ir.ts of the Kmmanuel congregation
for some time, but toward the close of
i his pastorate he failed to give that sat
isfaction which a successful pastor can
! claim, a fact which brought the close
of his pastorate all the quicker. It was
i finally suggested to him that he re
i sign, but this he refused; then some of
his friends went to him and told him
trouble might ensue if he continued to
hold the pastorate, and after some
persuasion he relinquished the position.
There were no definite grounds for
any dissatisfaction, but the pastor had
made himself obnoxious to many of
the members and to the trustees and
I his resignation was earnestly looked
for. He parted with the church with
a great deal of bitterness, bitterness
which had not worn away as late even
as last fall, for when Charles W. Ta
ber, one of the trustees of the church,
went to Boston and saw him at that
time he had not yet forgotten the man
ner in which he had been deposed.
The church was without a pastor for
some months after the resignation of
Mr. Creasy, and then Mr. Gibson was
made the permanent pastor. He knew
but little of his predecessor, and is at
a loss to define the reason for Mr. Cres
sy's implied criticism of him.
It is to this acrimonious feeling on
the part of the former minister that
the trustees attribute the entrance of
the Rev. Mr. Cressy into the Durrani
I case.

Onalaska, Wis.â For ten years I have

begin to tell you or remember the reme-
dies I havo taken or the prescriptions I
have tried. Take what I would. 1 grew
worse instead of better, and was well-
nigh discouraged. Then came the grate-
ful change. One month â on the ad-
vice of my brother, who sent me a boxâ
I commenced taking Dr. Charcofs Kola
Nervine Tablets. I have taken one box
and gained five pounds, but that is noth-
ing compared to the physical relief I have
experienced. I am better and happier
than I have been for five years. If I
could make the recommendation stronger
I would gladly do so.

Poor
Barr a good head despite the foul rid
ing of Conley, when to the surprise of
! nearly all the number of Garland Barr
j was Hashed as the winner. Possibly
; the gelding won; perhaps dreams
sometimes come to pass.
The going was of the splashy Bort
yesterday and picking winners was a
very uncertain pastime. Two first
choices were all that could land the
I coin.
The Lissak stake, valued at $1250,
; over six furlongs, resulted in a most
i pronounced victory for the fast colt
, Traverser, ridden by Thorpe. Coupled
jin the betting with Colonel Dan, the
I duo ruled 13 to 10 favorites in the bet
i ting. Traverser jumped out In front
and won with ease. Dr. Sharp with
Clayton In the saddle took the place
-with the same ease from Count of Flan
ders.
A big bunch of eighteen started in
the opening five and a half furlong
scramble and very little betting was
! done in the ring. A plunge was made
on Torpedo, forcing his odds down
from 6to 3>4. the post favorite. Dolore,
with Jones up, took a decided lead in
the stretch, winning easily at the end
from Voragua, ridden by Hennessy.
Heritage was a fair third. The winner
was 5 to 1 in the ring.
The Rprond event was another ?nr
tlon of the first affair, a five and a half
furlong spin, with ten lining up. Dave
Gideon's Destruction was responsible
for nearly bankrupting half the crowd.
The mare was hammcrpd down from
threes to 8 to 5, and O'Connor was un
able to land her inside the money.
Lonnie Clayton, astride O'Fleeta, took
the lead from Lucky Star and Jack
Martin the last furlong, downing the
former cleverly at the wire.
The smartest calculators figured Bar
ney Schreiber's gelding Imperious a
good thing for the nine furlong run.
Ho had IÂ»nnie Clayton on his back
and at even money carried s"ine big
commissions. He ran well to the
stretch, where he was in difficulties,
and ended up third. Fink's mare Bon
lta made nearly all thf> running and
won ridden out a length before thÂ»Â»
poorly piloted Attainment, with Jones
up.
The people who backed I Don't Know
to capture the final rao* of the <lay. a
six furlong: sprint, have an idea that
Mr. Ferguson is not so warm now.

horse out at the wire by half a dozen
lengths. The latter was backed down
from 10 to 3 to 1, and with an even
break would probably have downed the
winner. Torsion was a good third.

FOR SUGAR

A Hundred and Fifty
Thousand Acres

Will Immediately Be Put
Under the Proper
Cultivation.
Present Tenants May Cause a
Delay by Refusing to
Take Advice.
THREE BIG FACTORIES.
Work Will Be Started at Once to
Push the Plant to Com
pletion.
A cablegram was received yesterday
by Homer Wilson, announcing the ar
rival in London of "Willard E. Green.
who recently left for Europe in the in
terests of the big sugar-beet syndicate
â which has been negotiating for lands
in the Sacramento Valley. The cable
pram announced that the contracts
which have been secured were entire
ly satisfactory to those connected with
the venture, and now all that remains
Is to secure the proper persons to cul
tivate the beets.
Contracts have been signed by which
150,000 acres of land near Chlco, Marys
ville and Red Bluff has been secured
and the work of erecting three immense
sugar factories will be started at once.
The syndicate has a capital of $15,000.
000, and intends making the venture a
success if money and experience can
do it.
The land secured embodies tracts
from the Glenn ranch, the Bidwell
ranch, the Phelan estate, and the
Stanford estate, with other tracts in
smaller quantities. The principal trou
ble over the immediate installation of
the work on all tht- land arises from
the tenants who are disposed to reject
the advice offered them regarding the
proper manner of growing the sugar
beet.
The managers for the syndicate have
procured the best beet seed and ex
perienced men to teach the tenants
how to properly cultivate the root, but
there is a disposition to resent this as
unwarranted interference, and the ten
ants have already given so much trou
ble that it is possible that the syndi
cate may be compelled to look else
where for people to pwrprrly take care
of their interests, as it is contended
that unless the beets receive the best
of attention they will be unfit for su
gar-making.
A large acreage has already been put
under cultivation necessary to take it
from grain land to beet land, and it
will he seeded down as soon as spring
opens. It will take a year before all
arrangements are completed and the
factories are ready to take beets and
in the meanwhile the tenants who are
now on the land or those who will re
place them will be shown everything
that is necessary for their part of the
work.
Mr. Wilson was seen in his office in
the Mills building yesterday, but de
clined to talk on the sur>Ject further
than to say that the syndicate" was
ready to go ahead with the project and
the venture would be pushed to com
pletion as rapidly as possible. The exact
location of the three big factories has
not yet been definitely decided, but this
will be done immediately on the re
turn of Mr. Green from hlw consulta
tion with the European members of the
syndicate.
Colonel C. C. Royce of Ohico, who is
manager for part of the lands secured
by the syndicate, was in the city yes
terday, at th<> California. He takes
great interest in thf matter and is
sanguine that the lands secured by the
syndicate will raise the b^st beets in
the State, as h^ thinks the soil there
Is peculiarly adapted for Â«ueh roots. He
phowed Messrs. Green and Wilson over
the lands in question several days ago
and became very enthusiastic over the
subject.
Those who are interr-sted in the mat
ter feel that the returns from the ven
ture after the first year will give very
satisfactory dividends to those who
havp invested thHr money and will also
give a heavy sinking fund for the pur
pose of extending the plants if that
procedure is found advisable. Tt is ex
pected that the full acreage which has
been secured will h<Â» seeded down this
spring unless unforeseen difficulties
arise on account of the, action of the
tenants, but sho\ild this occur the man
agers of the business are prepared to
replace all who are dissatisfied.

Rev. Dr. Dllle will deliver an Illustrated

JUST ONE YEAR
OF HAPPINESS
After It John S. Hart of
Alameda Abandoned
His Wife.
He Left for This City Last Fri
day and Has Not Been
Seen by Her Since.
Trouble Over the Sale of Property.
A Former Sailor Boarding-
House Keeper.
One year of happy married life, a
quarrel on the anniversary of the wed
ding ceremony, and in three days'
time total disappearance of the man
of her choiceâ these are the facts which
cause Mrs. John S. Hart of 905 Eagle
avenue, Alameda, to mourn her fate
as being indeed sad.
John S. Hart is a man about 65 years
of age, and is well known along the
water front. Over twenty years ago
he used to run a sailor boarding house
here. About five years ago he was a
partner of "Billy" McCarthy, perhaps
the most popular man in the business.
But the two did not get along well and
the partnership was dissolved.
On January 4, 1897, Hart was mar
ried to Mrs. Jellovich of Alameda, a
widow with six children by a former
marriage, two boys and four girls. At
this time Hart had come into the pos
session of considerable property by the
death of his first wife. It had been left
him on condition that he should re
main single. If he married, all the
property was to revert to a stepson,
Henry Hart, the racing man. Shortly
before the marriage Hart comprqmised
matters by making an equitable divis-

ion with his stepson. This gave him
considerable property on Turk and
Steiner streets. Mrs. Hart owned then
as now the property at 905 Eagle ave
nue, in Alameda.
The marriage, according to the de
serted woman, proved to be without a
shadow to mar their happiness. Hart
was very good to her and furnished
her home wÂ»-11.
Not very long ago he disposed of his
property in this city for the sum <Â»f
JSOOO. When he went home and told his
wife about it she found fault with him
for not consulting her before he made
the sale. On the next day, the anni
versary of their marriage, he addressed
her angrily and remarked that he re
sented any interference in his affairs.
With these words he invited her to
come with him to this city and receive
back $1500 borrowed money. Mrs. Hart
accordingly came to San Francisco in
company with her husband and re
ceived the money.
Last Friday morning he arose early
and told his wife he was coming over
here to get a new pair of trousers. He
left the house, and that was the last
she has seen of him.
"I am sure he has deserted me," she
exclaimed yesterday, "because every
thing of value belonging to him is
gone. He must have contemplated the
move, because his personal property
was removed little by little so as not
to cause any alarm. He told me that
he would have his will made out a day
or two before he disappeared, but he
didn't do it."
It Is rumored that within the last
two or three days Hart has been seen
In this city near the Baldwin Theater.
Two Guilty Burglars.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 13, 1898.
BIRTH OF A
NEW CLUB
The San Francisco Wel
comed by Two Hun
dred Members.
Superb Apartments and En
chanting Outlooks Are
Admired.
Business and Professional Men Hail
the Organization in the Spreck
els Building.
The San Francisco Club, occupying
the sixteenth and seventeenth stories
of the Claus Spreckels building was
formally opened yesterday. The event
was delightful, as it assembled 200 rep
resentative business and professional
men of the city. Members inspected
the quarters at leisure, admired the
beautiful panorama of the peninsula,
listened to enchanting music and ex
changed personal greetings. There was
no programme of exercises, but in
honor of the occasion, smilax', palms,
ferns and flowers were arranged in ar
tistic form to gratify the vision of
members.
The c \fe, embracing the entire six
teenth floor, reserved and equipped for
the exclusive us^ of the club, presents
many admirable and convenient fea
tures. The space is ample to accom
modate two hundred at the tables. Aside
from the main restaurant there are
four detachable private dining-rooms,
each capable of accommodating ten
guests. The cuisine Is excellent and
the service commendable. The light
by day and night is abundant, and can
be adjusted in brilliancy at night or
softened by shades in the day.
The rooms of the seventeeth floor
are admirably arranged for club pur-
I'l'st-s. They can be opened In one semi
i circular suite or the billiard rooms and
sideboard may be separated from the
reading and reception rooms by fnM
ing doors. The embrasures of the
J'.yzantine windows are cushioned and
offer charming retreats.
From al! points of the club estab
lishment noble views of land, sea and
sky may be had. Locking to the
â outfc when the atmosphere is clear
one may see the city of San Jose and
its environs. A grand view of the
mountain range, of which Mount Ham
ilton is the dominant figure, is obtain
able. Looking to the west over Gol
den Gate Park a view of the ocean is
unfolded. The Immediate prospect em
bracing San Francisco, th*Â» islands of
the bay and the suburban cities on the
Alameda shore, is enchanting to the
sight.
The San Francisco Club begins its
career under the most agreeable au
spices. The limit of membership Is
already attained and it is sure to have
the honor of a waiting list within a
very short time. It is not the rival of
any other club or institution, but fills
p place of its own in the club life of
the metropolis.
An erroneous impression obtains
nmong members of the club that lunch
eon alone, is served. The rafe is at the
service of members of the institution
at all hours. Dinner and breakfast as
well as the noonday meal can be or
dered.
DIAMONDS RECOVERED.

A KLONDIKE ROMANCE.
A romantic wedding took plac In
St. Stephen's Episcopal Church yester
day, the contracting parties being
Miss Hattle M. Hall and E. Percy
Pond. The groom has had five years'
experience In Alaska, and has Just
returned from the Klondike, consider
ably better off In regards to thtÂ»
world's goods than when he left here.
After three years, spent principally In
Juneau, Mr. Pond paid a visit to
San Francisco, and here met Miss
Hall. It was a case of love at first
sight and an engagement soon fol
lowed. The young lady's mother would not allow her daughter to plight her
troth for longer than two years, however, so in order to win his bride Mr. Pond
had to accumulate a competency and be back In San Francisco this month. He
has succeeded, and the marriage In St. Stephen's yesterday followed as a mat
ter of course.
Mr. Pond was on his way back to San Francisco when the first great rush
to the Klondike began. At Juneau he had a steam launch and small schooner,
and when he saw hundreds of people stranded for the want of boats to trans
port thoir baggage he delayed his return to go Into the freighting business, at
which he did remarkably well.
After the honeymoon, â which â¢will be spent in Lower California, the happy
couple â will go to Juneau, where they will make their home, Mr. Pond making
periodical trips to the Klondike to look after his mining interests. The mar
riage ceremony wm performed by the Rev. E. J. Lion, the maid of honor was
Mips Susie Hall, the bridesmaids Miss May Windom and Miss BellÂ© McÃoyle,
while the groom was supported by George E. Bennett, Harry S. Scott and C. F.
Hayward.
The bride, a niece of John I. Sabin, president of the telephone company, is a
very handsome brunette and was a prominent teacher in the public schools.
Friday last fifteen lady teachers got together in the Moulder School, and at an
impromptu dinner made Miss Hall a very handsome wedding present.

CHARITABLE WORKERS.
Ladles of the Fruit and Flower
Mission MaKe an Appeal to
the Merchants.
The San Francisco Fruit and Flower
Mission elected officers for the coming
year at their annual meeting, at Golden
Gate Hall yesterday. New by-laws were
adopted and reports of the different offi
cers re-ad.
A sewing circle was added to the mis
sion and all the members will meet on
the second and third Tuesdays of the
month at Mrs. George Buckingham's
and then* wv, making wrappers and
gowns for the sick whom the mission
visits and who are always in need of
these necessities.
A strong appeal is being made to the
dry goods merchants of this city to give
donations of tennis flannel, canton flan
nel and muslin, as this will prove quite
an expense to the mission if it is obliged
to procure all of its own cloth. The
ladies feel sure that if the merchants
could only realize the poverty and dis
tress in this city they would only be too
pleased to donate some cloth.
The various people who have been so
kind to the mission last year by donating
money, books, flowers, and the doctors
who donated their services were ex
tended a vote of thanks.
The officers for the following year are
as follows: President, Miss Tda B. Fish
er- first vice-president, Mrs. George
Buckingham; second vice-president.
Miss Annie Bryce; corresponding secre
tary Miss Hilda Castle: recording sec
retary. Miss Corlnne Cook, and treasur
er, Miss Hanna L. I,cszynsky.
INTERESTING TAX QUESTION
Mayor Phelar) Wins His Suit
Agaiost the Estate of trje
Late Washiogton Ryer.

vor of Mayor Phehin in his action against

Phelan as purchaser of some property be
longing to the estate of Dr. Ryer is en
titled to recover taxes paid by him under
protest in November. lSf>3. and April. K*n.

lan were assessed against the original

THE KENTUCKY BLYTHES.
Their fUtorrjeys Taking Steps to
Appeal the Case to the Su
preme Court.
The attorneys Holladay for the Ken
tucky Blythes are evidently determined
that Florence Blythe-Hlnckley shall not
enjoy the estate In peace as long as
there is a court in the land to which they
can appeal, and in order to clear the
way f<>r this procedure they appeared in
the United States Circuit Court yester
day afternoon and moved that Judge
Morrow amend the final decree In the
Hlythe case by inserting- the following:
"For want of jurisdiction and without
prejudice to complainants' rights to
bring or maintain any suit they may be
advised in the proper court." The mo
tion was taken under advisement.
THE CAPTURED
COUNTERFEITER
His Name Believed to Be
R. F. Kerby, and Not
Kendall.
Supposed to Be the Man for
Whom Professor Dudley
Was Arrested.
The Authorities at Watsonvllle and
Santa Cruz Will Be Asked to
Have a Look at Him.
From Investigations made yesterday
Chief Lees thinks that the name of the
counterfeiter arrested Tuesday night is
R. F. Kerby and not Gilbert Kendall.
Among the documents found in his
room on Golden Gate avenue was an
envelope addressed to "R. F. Kerby,
Grand Hotel." The postmark on the
envelope had been torn off, but it is
believed to have been Portland. Or.
There is a love letter from Libble M.
Burnish of Portland to Kerby, and it
appears she was employed during the
holidays at Daniel & Fisher's store.
A letter from Portland has the sig
nificant question, "Have you got Into
any trruble like in Jacksonville?" Chief
Lees thinks from that question that
Kendall or Kerby had been arrested in
Jacksonville for counterfeiting, and he
will make inquiry to satisfy himself on
that point. Another letter is from
Charles F. Taylor, Magnolia, Fla_, and
the Chief thinks Taylor could give some
interesting information about the coun
terfeiter.
The Chief Is of the opinion that Ken
dall is a prominent member of an or
ganized gang of counterfeiters who. he
claims, are operating: throughout the
country, and h? will use every effort to
thoroughly identify him.
It is thought that Kendall is the man
who passed the counterfeit coin in
Watsonville and Santa Cruz, and for
whom Professor Dudley of Stanford
University was arrested and thrown
In Jail. It may be that Kendall had
a confederate who went around the
country disposing of the counterfeit
money, but the police are almost cer
tain that either Kendall or a confed
erate is responsible" for the professor's
arrest. Following up this belief the
authorities at Watsonville and Santa
Cruz will be asked to send some one
to the City Prison to see if Kendall
can be identified as having been seen
around either of these places.

Destructive Storms Along the Coast.
Reports of maritime disasters along the

HoÃtetter's Stomach Bitters as a remedy for

WREN MADE
A DETECTIVE
The Clever Policeman
Gets a Merited Pro
motion.
Coogan, "the Pride of Larkin
Street," Is Made a Ser
geant.
Two Deserving Promotions Mad*
by the Police Commis
sioners.
The Police Commissioners met last
night and appointed Policeman EB
ward Wren detective to fill the vacan
cy caused by the promotion of Cap
tain Bohen. Officer Clarence Coogan,
the "pride of Larkin street," was ap
pointed sergeant to fill the vacancy
caused by the retirement of Sergeant
Fitzgerald.
Wren was appointed a member of
the police force In September, 1887. HÂ»
made a number of important captures,
and a few years ago Chief Lees, real-
izing his worth, transferred him to the
upper office. Since then he has been
associated with Detective Edward Gfb
son, one of the cleverest men in the
department.
Both Chief Lees and Captain Bohen
regard Wren as an exceptionally clever
officer. For a number of years he was
stationed on the Barbary Coast, and
made a brilliant record. His work in
the Durrant case, coupled with the as
sistance cf Detective Gibson, won for
him the encomiuma of his superior of
ficers.
Coogan, who has been promoted ser
geant, is one of the most popular men
in the department. He was appointed
a member of the force on November
16, 1890, and has a host of friends. Sev
eral years ago he did duty on Stock
ton street, and made an excellent rec
ord. Subsequently he was detailed to
patrol Larkin street, from Market and
Sutter, and by his courteous treatment
he soon won himself the title of "The
Pride of Larkin street."
After his appointment was madÂ©
known Coogan was warmly congratu
lated by his fellow officers.
Chief Lees is extremely well pleased
over the appointments.
"Two better men could not have
been selected," he said after the meet
ing. "Wren Is an exceptionally clever
officer, and is well deserving of promo
tion. Coogan Is one of the best patrol
men In the department, and is held In
high regard by the Commissioners. He
is always courteous and kind, and in
my estimation he will prove one of the
most capable sergeants in the depart
ment."
